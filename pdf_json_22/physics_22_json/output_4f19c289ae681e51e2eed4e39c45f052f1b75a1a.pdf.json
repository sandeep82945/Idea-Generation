    "abstractText": "In the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model, existing theoretical and experimental constraints still permit the light charged Higgs boson with a mass below the top quark mass. We present a complete roadmap for the light charged Higgs boson at the LHC through the comprehensive phenomenology study, focusing on the normal scenario where the lighter CP -even Higgs boson is the observed Higgs boson. In type-I, it is challenging to simultaneously accommodate the light mass of the charged Higgs boson and the constraints from theory, electroweak precision data, Higgs data, b \u2192 s\u03b3, and direct search bounds. Consequently, the parameter space is extremely curtailed, which predicts somewhat definite phenomenological signatures. We find that the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson, MA, is the most crucial factor in the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson. IfMA is light, the charged Higgs boson decays mainly into AW\u00b1. When MA is above the AW\u00b1 threshold, the dominant decay mode is into \u03c4\u00b1\u03bd. Over the whole viable parameter space, we study all the possible production and decay modes of charged Higgs bosons at the LHC, and suggest three efficient channels: (i) pp \u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]; (ii) pp \u2192 HA/HH/AA \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213H\u00b1W\u2213 \u2192 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW ; (iii) pp \u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 [bb\u0304W ][bb\u0304W ]. Based on the sophisticated signal-background analyses including detector simulation, we showed that the significance of the first final state is large, that of the second one is marginal around three, but the third one suffers from huge tt\u0304 related backgrounds.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC in 2012 [1, 2] is a triumph achieved through cooperation between the theoretical and experimental communities in particle physics. Despite the completion of the standard model (SM), however, we still long for the next milestone to progress toward the final theory of the Universe, as facing the baffling questions such as the naturalness problem, the fermion mass hierarchy, the origin of CP violation in the quark sector, the baryogenesis, the non-zero neutrino masses, and the identity of dark matter. Since 2012, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have searched hard for the same success as the observed Higgs boson, a dramatic resonance bump in invariant mass distribution, but not achieved any success so far. A new direction of research arises in the framework of the SM effective field theory [3] where we systematically characterize the experimental deviations from the SM predictions without specifying the UV physics.\nNevertheless, direct searches for new particles should continue because they can explicitly reveal an essential aspect of the new physics (NP) theory. Many NP models have an extended Higgs sector. When additional Higgs doublets, triplets, or higher representations are included, a distinguished new particle is the charged Higgs boson H\u00b1. If H\u00b1 is light at a mass below the top quark mass, the implication on the UV theory shall be further profound. From this perspective, we consider the light charged Higgs boson in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [4\u20136], which\naccommodates five Higgs bosons, CP -even neutral h and H (mh < MH), CP -odd neutral A, and a pair of charged H\u00b1. The charged Higgs boson in type-II and type-Y is tightly constrained to be as heavy as MH\u00b1 & 800 GeV due to the measurements of the inclusive weak radiative Bmeson decay into s\u03b3 [7]. Only type-I and type-X can accommodate a light H\u00b1. We concentrate on type-I in this paper. In type-I, all the Yukawa couplings of H\u00b1 are inversely proportional to tan \u03b2, the ratio of two vacuum expectation values of two Higgs-doublet fields. The decay branching ratios ofH\u00b1 into a fermion pair are proportional to the fermion mass, which suggested the main search mode at the LHC as the production via the decay of the top quark t\u2192 bH+, followed by the decay H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd. Both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have analyzed this mode [8, 9], presenting the upper bound on B(t \u2192 bH\u00b1)\u00d7 B(H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd). The absence of new signal demands large tan \u03b2, e.g., tan \u03b2 & 10 for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV, which highly suppresses B(t \u2192 bH\u00b1) below O(10\u22124). Thereupon we come to question whether t \u2192 bH\u00b1 is indeed the golden mode for the light charged Higgs boson in type-I.\nIn this regard, other production and decay channels of the light charged Higgs boson in the 2HDM and 3HDM at the LHC1 have been studied recently. We summarize the literature survey on the light charged Higgs boson2 in Table I, specifying the theoretical model3, the production\n1 Future colliders have been shown efficient for production of a light H\u00b1, such as future electron-proton colliders\nfor H\u00b1 in type-III 2HDM [33] and three-Higgs-doublet model [12, 34]. 2 Some unconventional decay channels of the heavy H\u00b1 in the 2HDM have also been studied, such as H\u00b1 \u2192\nchannel, and the decay mode. Here \u201cIS\u201d stands for the inverted scenario where the observed Higgs boson at a mass of 125 GeV is the heavier CP -even H, while the light CP -even Higgs boson, denoted by \u03d50 in Table I, has not been observed yet [13, 23, 26, 27, 40\u201342]. The studies in Table I reveal some aspects of the characteristics of the light charged Higgs boson in type-I, but not the whole, because they focus on one or two specific channels. In addition, many studies are based on some conditions such as the Higgs alignment limit for the SM-like Higgs boson [41, 43\u201348] and the mass degeneracy of new Higgs bosons for the electroweak precision data [41, 49, 50]. But imposing the conditions could have interfered with the observation at the LHC. In order not to miss the light charged Higgs boson, therefore, we need a full roadmap over the whole viable parameter space of type-I. Then, it is essential to investigate all the possible production and decay modes as well as the optimal and representative channel for each region of the parameter space.\nTo achieve the goal, we will explore the entire parameter space of type-I with the light H\u00b1, and obtain the phenomenologically viable parameters. As shall be shown, imposing light MH\u00b1 restricts the model severely. In turn, the model parameters are strongly correlated with each other. Making the most of this feature, we pursue the efficient discovery channels of the light charged Higgs bosons at the LHC, which have definite signal rates throughout the allowed parameter space, i.e., weak dependence on the model parameters. As shall be shown, the pair production of the light charged Higgs boson serves our purpose. Based on these results, we will suggest three channels to cover the whole parameter space effectively: (i) pp\u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]; (ii) pp\u2192 HA/HH/AA\u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213H\u00b1W\u2213 \u2192 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW ; (iii) pp\u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 [bb\u0304W ][bb\u0304W ]. Using sophisticated signal-background analysis techniques with the detector simulation, the LHC discovery potentials of the proposed channels are to be rigorously obtained. These are our new contributions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly review the type-I 2HDM with CP invariance and softly broken Z2 parity. In Sec. III, we present the results of random scans by placing the theoretical and experimental constraints for MH\u00b1 = 110, 140 GeV. The characteristic features of the allowed parameters are to be discussed, including the branching ratios of the new Higgs bosons. Section IV deals with the production channels of a light H\u00b1 at the LHC. After finding all the possible signals, we suggest three main processes which can cover the allowed parameter space. In Sec. V, we perform the signal-to-background analysis for pp \u2192 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd], pp \u2192 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW , and pp \u2192 [bbW ][bbW ] at the HL-LHC. Conclusions are given in Sec. VI.\nW\u00b1A [35], H\u00b1 \u2192W\u00b1\u03b3 [36], and H\u00b1 \u2192 tb\u0304 [37\u201339]. 3 In Ref. [31], B\u03c4\u03bd \u2261 B(H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u00b1\u03bd) = 1 is assumed without specifying the type of the 2HDM.\nII. REVIEW OF TYPE-I 2HDM\nThe 2HDM accommodates two complex SU(2)L Higgs doublet scalar fields, \u03a61 and \u03a62 [5]:\n\u03a6i =\n \nw+i vi + hi + i\u03b7i\u221a\n2\n  , i = 1, 2, (1)\nwhere v1 and v2 are the nonzero vacuum expectation values of \u03a61 and \u03a62, respectively. The ratio of v2 to v1 defines the mixing angle \u03b2 by tan \u03b2 = v2/v1. In what follows, we use the simplified notation of sx = sinx, cx = cos x, and tx = tanx. The electroweak symmetry is\nbroken by v = \u221a v21 + v 2 2 = 246 GeV. The flavor-changing-neutral-current (FCNC) at tree level is prevented by a discrete Z2 symmetry, under which \u03a61 \u2192 \u03a61 and \u03a62 \u2192 \u2212\u03a62 [51, 52]. Then the most general and renormalizable scalar potential with CP invariance is\nV = m211\u03a6 \u2020 1\u03a61 +m 2 22\u03a6 \u2020 2\u03a62 \u2212m212(\u03a6\u20201\u03a62 + H.c.) (2)\n+ 1\n2 \u03bb1(\u03a6\n\u2020 1\u03a61) 2 + 1\n2 \u03bb2(\u03a6\n\u2020 2\u03a62) 2 + \u03bb3(\u03a6 \u2020 1\u03a61)(\u03a6 \u2020 2\u03a62) + \u03bb4(\u03a6 \u2020 1\u03a62)(\u03a6 \u2020 2\u03a61)\n+ 1\n2 \u03bb5\n[ (\u03a6\u20201\u03a62) 2 + H.c. ] ,\nwhere the m212 term softly breaks the Z2 parity. The model accommodates five physical Higgs bosons, the light CP -even scalar h, the heavy CP -even scalar H, the CP -odd pseudoscalar A, and a pair of charged Higgs bosons H\u00b1. The relations of the physical Higgs bosons with the weak eigenstates in Eq. (1) via two mixing angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 are referred to Ref. [36].\nThe SM Higgs boson hSM is\nhSM = s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1h+ c\u03b2\u2212\u03b1H. (3)\nWe take the normal scenario where the observed Higgs boson is h. Of special importance is the Higgs alignment limit where h = hSM. When s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 = 1, H \u2192 WW/ZZ, A \u2192 Zh, and H\u00b1 \u2192 W\u00b1(\u2217)h are prohibited at tree level, but the exotic Higgs decay h\u2192 AA is allowed if A is light enough. In this paper, we do not make any assumption on the model parameters.

(8)\nIII. CHARACTERISTICS OF TYPE-I WITH LIGHT CHARGED HIGGS BOSONS\nA. Theoretical and experimental constraints\nWe study the implication of the theoretical and experimental constraints on type-I with a\nlight H\u00b1. Two cases for MH\u00b1 are considered:\nMH\u00b1 = 110, 140 GeV. (9)\nThe other parameters are scanned over the following ranges:\nt\u03b2 \u2208 [2.7, 50], s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 [0.75, 1], (10) MH \u2208 [130, 3000] GeV, MA \u2208 [15, 3000] GeV, m212 \u2208 [\u221230002, 30002] GeV2.\nThe condition of t\u03b2 > 2.7 makes type-I consistent with the observation of b\u2192 s\u03b3 [57, 58]. The range of s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 is conservatively taken by considering the current Higgs precision data [59\u201361]: the most updated results on the coupling modifiers are \u03baZ > 0.86 and \u03baW > 0.94 with \u03baW,Z \u2264 1 at 95% C.L. [59]. For MH , we avoid the case where MH is too close to the observed Higgs boson mass.\nWith the prepared random parameter sets, we cumulatively impose the following constraints:\nStep-(i) Theory+EWPD+FCNC: We require the parameter set to satisfy the conditions\nin three categories.\n\u2022 Theoretical constraints\n1. Higgs potential being bounded from below [62];\n2. Perturbative unitarity of the amplitudes of scalar-scalar, scalar-vector, and\nvector-vector scatterings at high energies [63, 64];\n3. Perturbativity of the quartic couplings [5, 41];\n4. Vacuum stability [65, 66].\nThe detailed expressions are referred to the references.\n\u2022 Electroweak precision data We calculate the Peskin-Takeuchi electroweak oblique parameters in the 2HDM [67,\n68] and require \u03c72 < 7.815 for the current best-fit results of [69]\nS = \u22120.01\u00b1 0.10, T = 0.03\u00b1 0.12, U = 0.02\u00b1 0.11, (11)\nwhere the correlations among the oblique parameters have been properly taken into account.\n\u2022 b\u2192 s\u03b3 constraints We consider the most sensitive FCNC process to the 2HDM, b\u2192 s\u03b3 [7].\nStep-(ii) Higgs precision data: To check the consistency with the Higgs precision data, we\nuse HiggsSignals-v2.2.0 [54], which yields the \u03c72 output for 107 Higgs observables [70\u2013 77]. Since there are five model parameters with the given MH\u00b1 , the number of degrees of freedom is 102. We demand that the p-value be larger than 0.05. In addition, the total width of the Higgs boson is required to be within the experimental upper bound at 95% C.L., i.e., \u0393toth < 9.16 MeV [78].\nStep-(iii) Direct searches: Using HiggsBounds-5 [55], we calculate r95% for each direct\nsearch process at the LEP, Tevatron, and LHC, defined by\nr95% = Stype\u2212I S95%obs , (12)\nwhere Stype\u2212I is the predicted cross section in the model and S 95% obs is the observed upper bound on the cross section at the 95% C.L. A parameter set is excluded if r95% > 1.\nB. Characteristics of surviving parameters\nWe perform the random scan over the full five-dimensional parameter space and cumulatively impose the constraints in Step-(i), Step-(ii), and Step-(iii). First, we obtained 106 parameter sets that satisfy Step-(i) for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV and another 10 6 for MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV. After applying the constraints at Step-(ii), about 24.4% (27.4%) of 106 parameter sets survive for MH\u00b1 = 110 (140) GeV. Step-(iii) is most powerful in restricting the model: only 0.22% (1.1%) of the parameter sets after Step-(i) are allowed for MH\u00b1 = 110 (140) GeV. The smoking-gun process is the LHC search for pp\u2192 tt\u0304 followed by t\u2192 H+b\u2192 \u03c4\u03bd + b [8], which excludes more than 99% of the parameter sets that passed Step-(ii).5\n5 There exists an alternative Higgs scenario, the inverted scenario, where the heavier CP -even scalar H is the\nobserved Higgs boson at a mass of 125 GeV [40\u201342]. To answer whether the light charged Higgs boson is also allowed in this exotic setup, we scanned the parameter ranges of mh \u2208 [15, 120] GeV, MA \u2208 [15, 1000] GeV, s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 [\u22121, 1], m212 \u2208 [\u221220000, 20000] GeV2, and t\u03b2 = [2.7, 50] for MH\u00b1 = 110, 140 GeV. We found that 0.56% (3.9%) of the parameter points survive the final Step-(iii) for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV (140 GeV). A light charged Higgs boson is also feasible in the inverted scenario. But the phenomenological signatures in the inverted scenario are different from those in the normal scenario. First, h is lighter than the pseudoscalar A in most of the viable parameter space. Consequently the dominant decay mode of H\u00b1 is H\u00b1 \u2192W\u00b1h in the inverted scenario [23], but H\u00b1 \u2192 W\u00b1A in the normal scenario. Similarly, the decay modes for A and h are also considerably different between two scenarios. Full investigation of the light charged Higgs in the inverted scenario warrants another study.\n1\n1\nWe now investigate the characteristics of the finally allowed parameter sets. In Fig. 1, we show MA vs MH with the color code indicating the value of m 2 12 for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV (left panel) and MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV (right panel). We first observe that m 2 12 is positive and\nnot large: for example, 20 GeV . \u221a m212 . 120 GeV when MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV. The second important aspect is that the other new scalar bosons, H and A, cannot be too heavy. There exist upper bounds on their masses like MH ,MA . 570 GeV. Once the charged Higgs boson is light, partial decoupling of new Higgs bosons is not feasible in type-I. Another intriguing feature is the correlation between MH and MA. If MA is heavy (& 300 GeV), MH should be light. If MH is heavy above 300 GeV, the pseudoscalar A should have an intermediate mass, MA \u2208 [100, 150] GeV for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV and MA \u2208 [140, 200] GeV for MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV. A and H cannot be simultaneously heavy.\nOf special importance is the parameter region of MA < mh/2 where the exotic Higgs decay h \u2192 AA is kinematically allowed. All the surviving parameters, consistent with the current Higgs precision data [79\u201384], yield B(h \u2192 AA) . 10%. In detail, about 50% of the allowed parameter sets with MA < mh/2 predict B(h\u2192 AA) . 1% while about 20% yield 7% . B(h\u2192 AA) . 10%. The ongoing LHC searches for the exotic Higgs decay are extremely important in finding out the structure of type-I.\nFigure 2 shows t\u03b2 vs s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV (left panel) and MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV (right panel), with the color code indicating MA. We observe that t\u03b2 . 10 is still allowed, as low as t\u03b2 ' 2.7. It seems contradictory to the usual conclusion that no signal for the light H\u00b1 at the LHC demands large t\u03b2 in type-I. Note that the conclusion is based on the assumption of MH\u00b1 ' MH ' MA: the light H\u00b1 decays only into the SM fermions. Even though the mass degeneracy can easily satisfy the constraint from the Peskin-Takeuchi oblique parameters, the current data in Eq. (11) leave some room for sizable mass differences, especially when the new Higgs bosons are not heavy. All of the surviving points with t\u03b2 . 10 incorporate light MA, which opens the H \u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1(\u2217) mode. Consequently, B(H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd) reduces and the\nMH\u00b1 = 110 GeV MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nt\u21e4b\ncb\n1\nMH\u00b1 = 110 GeV MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nt\u21e4b\ncb\n1\nAW+(\u21e4)\n1\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\n1\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nt\u21e4b\n1\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nt\u21e4b\ncb\n1\nMH\u00b1 = 110 GeV MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nt\u21e4b\ncb\n1\nB( H\n+ !\nX )\nB( A\n!

If MA is above the threshold of H\u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1(\u2217), t\u03b2 should be large, t\u03b2 & 15 forMH\u00b1 = 110 GeV and t\u03b2 & 9 forMH\u00b1 = 140 GeV. Finally, we observe that sizable deviation from the alignment limit is still possible in type-I, like s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 & 0.87. As a result, the model can accommodate H \u2192 WW/ZZ, A \u2192 hZ, and H\u00b1 \u2192 W\u00b1(\u2217)h.\nWe move on to the next question of whether the new Higgs bosons prefer some specific decay modes. It is closely related to one of our goals, a complete roadmap for the light charged Higgs boson in type-I. The critical parameter is found to be MA.

We include the three-body decay of AW\u00b1(\u2217).6 For H\u00b1 \u2192 qq\u0304 \u2032, we incorporate QCD radiative corrections at order \u03b12s in the MS scheme [85\u201387] by using 2HDMC [53]. For the running fermion masses in the Higgs couplings, we resum the leading logarithmic corrections to all orders with the renormalization scale of \u00b5R = MH\u00b1 in the MS scheme.\nFigure 3 clearly demonstrates strong correlation between B(H\u00b1 \u2192 X) and MA. For a light A below the AW\u00b1 threshold, H\u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1(\u2217) is dominant, which was first pointed out in Ref. [88]. If the on-shell decay is possible, the branching ratio reaches almost 100%. The off-shell decay also has a sizable branching ratio. Large B(H\u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1(\u2217)) is attributed to the gauge coupling of the H\u00b1-W\u2213-A vertex. As soon as MA crosses over the kinematic threshold, H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u00b1\u03bd mode becomes important, yielding B(H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd) ' 60 (30)% for MH\u00b1 = 110 (140) GeV. The hadronic modes such as t\u2217b and cs are also substantial.\nFigure 4 presents the branching ratios of A vs MA for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV (left panel) and MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV (right panel). We see a strong correlation between B(A \u2192 X) and MA. Below the threshold of A \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213(\u2217) , A \u2192 bb\u0304 is the dominant decay mode, followed by A\u2192 gg and A\u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212. Above the threshold, H\u00b1W\u2213 is the main decay mode. Unexpected is sizable and almost constant B(A\u2192 ZH) when MA & 300 GeV. The result is attributed to two factors: the A-Z-H vertex is favored by the alignment; a heavy MA is permitted only for light MH as shown in Fig. 1. B(A\u2192 Zh) is suppressed by the factor c2\u03b2\u2212\u03b1. B(A\u2192 tt\u0304) is also small because MA above the kinematic threshold (MA > 2mt) requires large t\u03b2 which suppresses the top quark Yukawa coupling to A.\n6 The three-body decay of H\u00b1 \u2192 A\u2217W\u00b1 is negligible since the Yukawa couplings of A to ff\u0304 are much smaller than the gauge couplings of the W\u00b1 boson.\nMH\u00b1 = 110 GeV MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nt\u21e4b\ncb\n1\nB( H\n+ !\nX )\nB( A\n!

We fix MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV.\nUnlike H\u00b1 and A, the heavy CP -even H shows the wide variety of decay patterns. In Fig. 5, we present B(H \u2192 X) vs MH for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV. Nine decay modes (\u03c4+\u03c4\u2212, ZZ, W+W\u2212, bb\u0304, gg, ZA, AA, H+H\u2212, and H\u00b1W\u2213) are all mixed up, particularly when MH < MH\u00b1 +mW : for a clear distinction, we present the decays into the SM particles in the left panel and the decays into one or two new Higgs bosons in the right panel. The complication is from the involvement of two model parameters, MH and s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1. Another important feature is that below the threshold of H \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213, H \u2192 ZZ and H \u2192 W+W\u2212 become substantial, which represents a deviation from the Higgs alignment limit. Above the threshold, H \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213 is dominant in a large portion of the allowed parameter space (see the right panel of Fig. 5). The sizable H-H\u00b1-W\u2213 vertex provides a new production channel for the light charged Higgs boson in type-I.\nThe final study in this section is on the conventional production channels of the light charged Higgs boson, gb \u2192 tH\u00b1 and pp \u2192 btH\u00b1, which resort on a single H\u00b1 production. We calculate the parton-level cross sections at the LHC with \u221a s = 14 TeV, as scanning over the viable parameter space. We used MadGraph aMC@NLO [89] with NNPDF31 lo parton distribution function (PDF) set [90] in the five quark flavor scheme. Figure 6 presents, as a function of MA, the cross sections of gb \u2192 tH\u00b1 in the left panel and those of pp \u2192 btH\u00b1 in the right panel. The color code indicates the value of t\u03b2. We fix MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV and demand pbT > 30 GeV and |\u03b7b| < 2.5. For pp \u2192 btH\u00b1, we included not only the gluon fusion production but also qq\u0304 annihilation production. Since MH\u00b1 is considerably lighter than the top quark mass, the cross section of pp \u2192 btH\u00b1, mainly through the top quark pair production followed by t\u2192 bH\u00b1, is much larger than that of gb\u2192 tH\u00b1. For the given MA, which governs the decays of H\u00b1 and A, the cross sections of two production channels show wide varieties. Instead, the value of t\u03b2 strongly correlates with the cross sections, which are proportional to\nMH\u00b1 = 110 GeV MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nt\u21e4b\ncb\n1\nM H\n\u00b1 =\n11 0\nG eV\nM H\n\u00b1 =\n14 0\nG eV\nB R\n(H !\nH \u00b1 W\n\u2325 )\n[f b ]\nA W\n+ (\u21e4\n)\n\u2327\n+ \u2327\nZ Z\n\u2327 \u232b\nbb\u0304\n\u2327 \u2327\ncs\nZ\nh\nbb\nt\u21e4 b\nZ H\ng g\ncb\ng\ng\nW\nW\nW W\nH \u00b1 W\n\u2325 Z\nA\nA A\nH\n\u00b1\nW\n\u2325\n1\ncs Zh bb t\u21e4b ZH gg cb gg WW WW \u2022 ZA (6) \u2022 AA \u2022 H+H \u2022 H\u00b1W\u2325 AA\nH\u00b1W\u2325\nt\n2\ncs Zh bb t\u21e4b ZH gg cb gg WW WW \u2022 ZA (6) \u2022 AA \u2022 H+H \u2022 H\u00b1W\u2325\nAA\nH\u00b1W\u2325\nt pp ! tbH\u00b1 gb ! tH\u00b1\n2\nMH\u00b1 = 110 GeV MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV\nAW+(\u21e4)\n\u2327\u232b\ncs\nt\u21e4b\ncb\n1\nM H\n\u00b1 =\n11 0\nG eV\nM H\n\u00b1 =\n14 0\nG eV\nB R\n(H !\nH \u00b1 W\n\u2325 )\n[f b ]\nA W\n+ (\u21e4\n)\n\u2327\n+ \u2327\nZ Z\n\u2327 \u232b\nbb\u0304\n\u2327 \u2327\ncs\nZ\nh\nbb\nt\u21e4 b\nZ H\ng g\ncb\ng\ng\nW W\nW W\nH \u00b1 W\n\u2325 Z\nA\nA A\nH \u00b1 W\n\u2325\n1\ncs Zh bb t\u21e4b ZH gg cb gg WW WW \u2022 ZA (6) \u2022 AA \u2022 H+H \u2022 H\u00b1W\u2325 AA\nH\u00b1W\u2325\nt\n2\ncs Zh bb t\u21e4b ZH gg cb gg WW WW \u2022 ZA (6) \u2022 AA \u2022 H+H \u2022 H\u00b1W\u2325\nAA\nH\u00b1W\u2325\nt pp ! tbH\u00b1\n2\nFigure 6: Parton-level cross sections of gb\u2192 tH\u00b1 (left panel) and pp\u2192 btH\u00b1 (right panel) at the 14 TeV LHC. We fix MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV and impose p b T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7b| < 2.5.\n1/t2\u03b2. So the conventional production channels, which are more model-dependent, complicate the search for the light charged Higgs boson. Furthermore, these processes of a single H\u00b1 production suffer from huge backgrounds. In this work, therefore, we consider the unconventional production channels of the light charged Higgs boson through the pair production, avoiding the direct decay from the top quark.\nIV. PRODUCTION OF LIGHT CHARGED HIGGS BOSONS AT THE LHC\nBased on the characteristics of the viable parameter space, we develop the search strategies for the light H\u00b1 in type-I. Since MA is shown to be the key parameter, we divide the parameter space into two regions, the light A case and the heavy A case with the threshold of M thresholdA ' 100 (120) GeV for MH\u00b1 = 110 (140) GeV. When A is light, H \u00b1 dominantly decays into AW\u00b1, and A decays into bb\u0304. In the heavy A case, H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd and A\u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213 are main decay modes. For the decays of H, we focus on H \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213 to find new production channels of the light charged Higgs boson at the LHC.\nIn Table II, we summarize the possible production channels of the light H\u00b1 at the LHC, and the final states from the targeted decay modes of H\u00b1, A, and H. To emphasize the decay products of a charged Higgs boson, we adopt the notation of a square bracket: [ijk] denotes H\u00b1 \u2192 ijk. To find the processes with high LHC discovery potential, we focus on the production of two charged Higgs bosons, which is more challenging for the background to mimic. We also consider the process with additional tagging particles that help to tame the background and increase the significance. And we avoid the signal processes with too small cross section, below about 1 fb. In Table II we put the checkmarks on the candidate processes.\nIn this regard, we study the following four channels:\n\u2022 For the light A case,\n\u2013 [bbW ][bbW ]:\nThe signal cross section is\n\u03c3[bbW ][bbW ] = [ \u03c3(qq\u0304 \u2192 H+H\u2212) + \u03c3(gg \u2192 H+H\u2212) ] (13)\n\u00d7B(H+ \u2192 AW+)2 \u00d7 B(A\u2192 bb\u0304)2.\n\u2013 [bbW ][bbW ]W :\nThe total signal rate is\n\u03c3[bbW ][bbW ]W = [ \u03c3(qq\u0304\u2032 \u2192 W+\u2217 \u2192 H+H) + \u03c3(qq\u0304\u2032 \u2192 W\u2212\u2217 \u2192 H\u2212H) ] (14)\n\u00d72B(H \u2192 H+W\u2212)B(H+ \u2192 AW+)2B(A\u2192 bb\u0304)2.\nFour different charge conjugation combinations are to be summed.\n\u2022 For the heavy A case,\n\u2013 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd](j):\nThe signal cross section is\n\u03c3[\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]j = [ \u03c3(pp\u2192 H+H\u2212) + \u03c3(pp\u2192 H+H\u2212j) ] \u00d7 B(H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd)2.

The particles inside a square bracket represent the decay products of a charged Higgs boson, and j30 denotes a jet with p j T > 30 GeV. We consider MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV (left panel) and MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV (right panel).\nA pair of charged Higgs bosons is produced at the LHC via the Drell-Yan process and the gluon fusion.\n\u2013 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW :\nWe have\n\u03c3[\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW = [ \u03c3(qq\u0304 \u2192 Z\u2217 \u2192 HA)\u00d7 4B(H \u2192 H+W\u2212)B(A\u2192 H+W\u2212) (16) +\u03c3(gg \u2192 HH)\u00d7 4B(H \u2192 H+W\u2212)2\n+\u03c3(gg \u2192 AA)\u00d7 4B(A\u2192 H+W\u2212)2 ]\u00d7 B(H+ \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd)2,\nwhere the factor of four covers four different combinations of charge conjugation. Half of them correspond to the same-sign W \u2019s, \u03c4+\u03c4+W\u2212W\u2212\u03bd\u03bd and \u03c4\u2212\u03c4\u2212W+W+\u03bd\u03bd.\nOver the whole parameter space that satisfies all the theoretical and experimental constraints at Step-(i), Step-(ii), and Step-(iii), we calculate the parton-level cross sections at the LHC with\u221a s = 14 TeV. We use MadGraph aMC@NLO [89] with NNPDF31 lo parton distribution function (PDF) set [90]. The renormalization and factorization scales are set to \u00b5R = \u00b5F =\u2211 i(1/2) \u221a p2T,i +m 2 i . Since the 2HDM UFO file in the MadGraph misses some important decay modes of new scalar bosons such as H\u00b1 \u2192 cs and A \u2192 gg, we modified the values of the extra scalar decay widths in the MadGraph input cards to match the output of the 2HDMC [53]. In Fig. 7, we present the parton-level cross sections for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV (left panel) and MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV (right panel). Here [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]j30 denotes the pair production of charged Higgs bosons with one extra jet from initial state radiation (ISR). The subscript in j30 points out the additional requirement of pjT > 30 GeV. As shown below, including an extra-jet emission considerably improves the signal significance.\nFigure 7 clearly demonstrates the crucial role of MA in the LHC phenomenology of the light H\u00b1 in type-I. For MA < M thresholdA , only the process pp \u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 [bbW ][bbW ] (red points) has sizable cross sections, which reaches about 100 fb for MH\u00b1 = 110 GeV and about 80 fb for MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV. An advantage of this process is that the cross sections have small variations over all the surviving parameters. There are two reasons. First, the main production of a charged Higgs boson pair, the Drell-Yan process, is determined solely by MH\u00b1 . Second, the decays of H\u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1 and A \u2192 bb\u0304 are dominant for light MA, irrespective to t\u03b2 (see Figs. 3 and 4).\nWhen the light MA approaches M threshold A , the signal rate of [bbW ][bbW ]W\n\u00b1 (yellow points)\ncan be substantial when various conditions fit exquisitely. The parameters with MA 'M thresholdA strongly prefer heavy MH : see Fig. 1. Then a large portion of the parameter space yields sizable branching ratio for H \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213. The production of qq\u0304\u2032 \u2192 W \u2217 \u2192 H\u00b1H, favored by the Higgs alignment, is followed by H \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213 and H\u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1. The final state becomes [bbW ][bbW ]W\u00b1.\nAs soon as MA exceeds M threshold A , the cross section of [bbW ][bbW ] rapidly drops and pp \u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd] becomes dominant. The cross section of [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd] is almost constant because B(H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd) is nearly constant for heavy MA. We also show the signal rate of [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]j30 (magenta points). Although it is a 2\u2192 3 QCD process, gq \u2192 H+H\u2212q is benefited by the high gluon luminosity. The extra-jet emission is known to be useful in improving the significance, particularly for rare NP processes [91]. Furthermore, it provides more kinematic control to suppress the backgrounds.\nFinally, we exhibit the cross sections of [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW (blue points), which become sizable for moderately heavy MA, above M threshold A but below about 250 GeV. The pseudoscalar mass in this range demands MH above the threshold of H \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213, as shown in Fig. 1. As a result, both A and H decay into H\u00b1W\u2213 with a non-negligible branching ratio. The associated production of H and A mediated by Z, which is preferred by the Higgs alignment limit, leads to [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW . Note that the gluon-fusion productions of HA, HH, and AA also generate the same final state.\nV. SIGNAL-BACKGROUND ANALYSIS FOR [bbW ][bbW ], [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd], AND [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW\nIn the previous section, we calculated the parton-level cross sections of the proposed channels to probe the lightH\u00b1 in type-I. Although their magnitudes are not small, the discovery potential depends on how efficiently we isolate the signal from the overwhelming backgrounds. In this section, we develop the search strategies for a fully-fledged signal-to-background optimization which relies upon sophisticated tools that include hard-scattering matrix elements, resonance decays, parton showers, hadronization, hadron decays, and a simplified detector\u2019s response. Targeting the HL-LHC, we perform detailed studies of the following three processes: [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd](j), [\u03c4\u00b1\u03bd][\u03c4\u00b1\u03bd]W\u2213W\u2213, and [bbW ][bbW ]. For each channel, we adopt the benchmark set in Table III. We also list the backgrounds. The benchmark points for [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd] and [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW are\nrepresentative of the process because all the allowed parameters yield similar signal rates. But the benchmark point for [bbW ][bbW ] is chosen to maximize the signal rate.\nBefore getting into the detailed analysis for each process, we present the common ingredients. For the Monte Carlo event generation of the signal and backgrounds, we use the 2HDM UFO file [92] and MadGraph aMC@NLO version 2.6.7. [89] with the NNPDF31 lo set of parton distribution functions [90]. As in the previous section, the input cards in the MadGraph aMC@NLO are modified in accordance with the values of 2HDMC [53]. We use the default settings in the run-card of Madgraph5 such as pT > 10 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5, and \u2206R(`, `) \u2265 0.4, where \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7)2 + (\u2206\u03c6)2. The resulting parton-level events are passed to Pythia version 8.243 to add parton showering, hadronization, and hadron decays [93]. We perform a fast detector simulation of the signal and backgrounds using the Delphes version 3.4.2 [94]. Jet is clustered according to the anti-kT algorithm [95] with a jet radius R = 0.4. Since we demand to trigger at least one charged lepton, we do not include the pileup effects. We also turn off the multiple parton interactions from the soft QCD contribution at the level of Pythia 8. Under the above setup, we generate the signal and background events, which are to be called \u201cInitial events\u201d in what follows.\nWe now turn into the discussion of the object identification, which consists of \u03c4\u2013tagging, b\u2013tagging, and a charged lepton. The quality of \u03c4\u2013tagging is crucial and vital for [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd] and [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW . A tau lepton that decays hadronically, denoted by \u03c4h in what follows, can be distinguished from a QCD jet by fewer particle multiplicity and more localized energy deposits. Recently, the \u03c4h\u2013tagging efficiency has increased significantly with the improvements in \u03c00 reconstruction and multivariate discriminants [96]. At the Delphes level, we set the\n\u03c4h\u2013tagging efficiencies and the mistagging rates of a light jet (j) or the b jet as \u03c4h: 7\nP\u03c4\u2192\u03c4 = 0.85, Pj\u2192\u03c4 = 0.02, in the one-prong \u03c4 decays; (17)\nP\u03c4\u2192\u03c4 = 0.65, Pj,b\u2192\u03c4 = 0.01, in the three-prong \u03c4 decays.\nWe also note that the sign of the electric charge of \u03c4\u00b1h can be determined by the charged tracks.\nThe b\u2013tagging is critical for all three processes. We employ b\u2013tagging to remove the tt\u0304 related backgrounds in the [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd] and [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW and to improve the signal preselection for the [bbW ][bbW ] process. In general, b\u2013tagging is based on the so-called ghost-association technique [98] where a reconstructed jet is b\u2013tagged if any B hadron with pT > 5 GeV is found within \u2206R = 0.3 of the jet. In this connection, we first require that a candidate for a b jet should have minimal acceptance and trigger cuts of pT > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Then we apply the b\u2013tagging efficiency and the mistag rates of the charm or light quark jet as a b-jet [99, 100]:\nPb\u2192b = 70%, Pc\u2192b = 10%, Pj\u2192b = 0.2%. (18)\nFor the lepton (`\u00b1 = e\u00b1, \u00b5\u00b1) identification, we demand the same rapidity of |\u03b7`| < 2.5, but different pT cuts for the electron and muon as p e T > 17 GeV and p \u00b5 T > 15 GeV. To reduce the leptons from decays of heavy hadrons, we apply tight isolation criteria. For each charged lepton, we compute the isolation variable given by\nI` \u2261 1\np`T\n\u2211\ni\npTi , (19)\nwhere the sum runs over photon, (neutral and charged) hadrons within \u2206R = 0.2 (0.3) around the electron (muon) direction. In this analysis, we require I` < 0.06.\nFinally, we calculate the signal significance including the background uncertainty, defined\nby [101]\nS= [\n2(Ns +Nb) log\n( (Ns +Nb)(Nb + \u03b4 2 b )\nN2b + (Ns +Nb)\u03b4 2 b\n) \u2212 2N 2 b\n\u03b42b log\n( 1 +\n\u03b42bNs Nb(Nb + \u03b42b )\n)]1/2 , (20)\nwhere Ns is the number of signal events, Nb is the number of total background events, and \u03b4b = \u2206bgNb is the uncertainty on the background yields.\nA. [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]\nThe [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd] mode targets at the production of a charged Higgs boson pair, pp \u2192 H+H\u2212, followed by H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u00b1h \u03bd:\npp\u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4+h \u03bd \u03c4\u2212h \u03bd. (21)\n7 The CMS collaboration has measured the misidentification probability of a b jet as \u03c4h by using the final states\nof e\u00b5+ jets in the tt\u0304 events where the misidentified \u03c4h is dominated by the b jet [96]. In this paper, however, we take a conservative stance that the b jet has the same misidentification probability as the other QCD jets [97].\nThe final state consists of two hadronic \u03c4 \u2019s and missing transverse energy. As shown in Fig. 7, this process covers most of the parameter space with MA > MH\u00b1 \u2212 10 GeV. At the 14 TeV LHC with the total integrated luminosity of Ltot = 3 ab\u22121, we prepared the signal samples up to one merged jet using the MLM scheme based on kT jet clustering algorithm [102]. The benchmark point BP\u20131 in Table III yields\n\u03c3(pp\u2192 H+H\u2212) + \u03c3(pp\u2192 H+H\u2212j) = 0.35 pb, B(H\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4\u00b1\u03bd) = 0.652, (22)\nwhere we have imposed pjT > 10 GeV.\nNow we cautiously assess the backgrounds.

The different background contributions are stacked on top of each other, and the expected signal is shown by black line. The distribution about EmissT is after imposing the basic cut, while the others are after imposing EmissT > 100 GeV.\n\u2013 We veto any event with an electron, a muon, or a b-tagged jet. Most of the tt\u0304+jets\nbackgrounds are rejected by the b-veto.\n\u2013 We select the events including \u03c4h\u03c4h, \u03c4h\u03c4h\u03c4h, or \u03c4h\u03c4hj. Here a \u03c4h jet is accepted when\npT > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5.\n\u2013 The electric charges of two \u03c4h jets should have opposite sign.\nFor the signal and background events after the basic cuts, we calculate various kinematic distributions. We show the distributions about missing transverse energy EmissT (top-left panel), \u2206R(\u03c41, \u03c42) (top-right panel), the transverse momentum of the second-leading tau lepton p \u03c42 T (bottom-left panel), and the transverse mass of the second-leading tau lepton M \u03c42T (bottomright panel) in Fig. 8. \u03c41 and \u03c42 are ordered by the pT such that p \u03c41 T > p \u03c42 T . M \u03c4 T is the transverse\nmass of a tau lepton, defined by\nM \u03c4T = \u221a 2|p\u03c4T ||EmissT | \u00d7 {1\u2212 cos(\u03c6\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c6miss)}, (23)\nwhere \u03c6\u03c4 and \u03c6miss are the azimuth angle of the \u03c4 lepton and the missing momentum, respectively. As shown in the top-left panel, EmissT plays a critical role in separating the signal from the background. The main backgrounds of Zjj and Wjj yield relatively soft EmissT , while the signal produces hard EmissT . For this reason, we enforce E miss T > 100 GeV. The other three distributions in Fig. 8 are the results after imposing EmissT > 100 GeV. Only about 0.2% of the backgrounds survive the EmissT selection, while about 18% of the signal events remain.\nBased on the investigation of the kinematic distributions, we devise a search strategy summarized in the cutflow. One of the most efficient cuts is M\u03c41\u03c42 > 300 GeV, which removes about 99% of the backgrounds but 80% of the signal. In the signal, M\u03c41\u03c42 tends to be high because two tau leptons originate from different ancestors (H+ and H\u2212). The cut of p\u03c42T > 100 GeV has certain advantage in separating the signal from the backgrounds, especially tt\u0304+jets and V V \u2032+jets: surviving rate of the signal is about 75% while that of the total backgrounds is 68%. At this level, the dominant background is from Z/\u03b3+jets. The final selection is on the transverse mass of the second-leading tau lepton, which aims at a \u03c4 associated with a neutrino. M \u03c42T > 50 GeV removes almost all the backgrounds from Z/\u03b3+jets. At the final selection level, 284 signal events and 222 background events survive. The dominant backgrounds are tt\u0304+jets and V V \u2032+jets. The significance without the background uncertainty is 19.7, which is very promising. Even with 10% background uncertainty, the significance is 8.2. Certainly, the HL-LHC can probe the light H\u00b1 through the [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd] final state if the mass MA is above the decay threshold of H\u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1.\nB. [\u03c4\u00b1\u03bd][\u03c4\u00b1\u03bd]W\u2213W\u2213\nWe consider the signal of\npp\u2192 HA/HH/AA \u2192 H\u2212W+H\u2212W+ + C.C. (24) \u2192 \u03c4\u2212h \u03bd `+\u03bd \u03c4\u2212h \u03bd `+\u03bd + C.C.,\nwhere C.C. denotes the charge conjugate state. The final state consists of two same-sign leptons, two same-sign hadronic \u03c4 \u2019s, and neutrinos. We consider the benchmark point BP\u20132 in Table III, where B(H \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213) = 0.82, B(A \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213) = 0.88, and B(H+ \u2192 \u03c4+\u03bd) = 0.65. Drell-Yan production of HA is dominant over the gluon fusion production of HH and AA: \u03c3(qq\u0304 \u2192 HA) = 75.5 fb, \u03c3(gg \u2192 HH) = 0.68 fb, and \u03c3(gg \u2192 AA) = 0.80 fb. Therefore, we only generate the signal sample through qq\u0304 \u2192 HA.\nFor the final state \u03c4\u2212h \u03c4 \u2212 h ` +`+EmissT , the backgrounds are as follows:\n\u2022 pp \u2192 tt\u0304 + W+ \u2192 b`+\u03bdb\u0304\u03c4\u2212\u03bd + `+\u03bd where one of two b jets or a jet from QCD showering is misidentified as \u03c4h.\n\u2022 pp\u2192 W\u2212W+W+ \u2192 \u03c4\u2212h \u03bd`+\u03bd`+\u03bd where a jet from showering is misidentified as \u03c4h.\n\u2022 pp\u2192 ZZ \u2192 \u03c4+`+\u03c4\u2212h \u03c4+`+\u03c4\u2212h where \u03c4` denotes the leptonic decaying \u03c4 .\n\u2022 pp\u2192 tt\u0304+ Z \u2192 b`+\u03bdb\u0304\u03c4\u2212\u03bd + \u03c4+`+\u03c4\u2212.\n\u2022 pp\u2192 hSM + Z \u2192 \u03c4+`+\u03c4\u2212h + \u03c4+`+\u03c4\u2212h .\nWe also include the backgrounds for the charge conjugate signal state.\nFor event selection, we take the following steps. The \u201cBasic cuts\u201d consist of two.\n\u2013 We require two same-sign charged leptons and two same-sign hadronic \u03c4 \u2019s with p`,\u03c4T >\n20 GeV and |\u03b7`,\u03c4 | < 2.5.\n\u2013 The electric charge of two same-sign leptons should be opposite to that of two same-sign\ntau leptons.\nAfter the basic cuts, the signal rate is considerably reduced. The resulting acceptance times efficiency, A\u00d7 , is about 3%. But the reduction of the total backgrounds is more severe with A \u00d7 ' 0.3%. The basic cuts are most effective in the WWW background process since it is difficult for a QCD showering jet (mistagged as \u03c4h) to satisfy the requirement for the pT and electric charge. The second selection is the b-jet veto. We reject the event including any b-tagged jet with pbT > 30 GeV and |\u03b7b| < 2.5. It is designed to suppress the ttW and ttZ backgrounds, which results in a roughly 80% cut.

At this level, the significance without the background uncertainty is about 2.\nTo devise more sophisticated selections, we show in Fig. 9 the kinematic distributions of the signal and backgrounds about missing transverse energy EmissT (top-left panel), the transverse momentum of the leading lepton p` (lead)\nT (top-right panel), the angular separation \u2206R(`, \u03c4)1\n(bottom-left panel), and the invariant mass M(`, \u03c4)2 (bottom-right panel). The results are based on the events passing the basic cuts and b\u2212jet veto. The first decisive cut is from the EmissT distribution. Both ZZ and hSMZ backgrounds have lower E miss T than the signal. We take EmissT > 45 GeV as the third selection, removing about 70% of ZZ and hSMZ backgrounds. The next important selection comes from the p` (lead)\nT distribution (top-right panel) where ` (lead)\ndenotes the lepton with the largest pT . p `(lead) T in the signal is softer than that in most of the backgrounds, while p\u03c4 (lead)\nT in the signal is relative harder. In this regard, we select the events\n24\nwith p` (lead) T < 70 GeV and p \u03c4 (lead) T > 40 GeV.\nThe final four selections in Table V are motivated by the characteristic of the signal pp \u2192 H + A \u2192 H+\u03c4+\u03bdW\u2212`\u2212\u03bd + H+\u03c4+\u03bdW\u2212`\u2212\u03bd . Two same-sign charged leptons in the signal come from different mother particles, H and A. To make the best use of the feature, we first select a pair of ` and \u03c4 with minimal \u2206R(`i, \u03c4j), and call the pair (`, \u03c4)1. The remaining pair of lepton and \u03c4 is (`, \u03c4)2. In the bottom-left panel of Fig. 9, we show the distribution of the angular distance between the lepton and \u03c4 inside (`, \u03c4)1. The bottom-right panel presents the distribution of the invariant mass of the lepton and \u03c4 inside (`, \u03c4)2. The signal is mainly populated in the regions of low \u2206R(`, \u03c4)1,2 and low M(`, \u03c4)1,2, compared with the backgrounds. So we make the final four selections of 0.4 < \u2206R(`, \u03c4)1 < 0.8, M(`, \u03c4)1 < 60 GeV, 0.4 < \u2206R(`, \u03c4)2 < 3.0, and M(`, \u03c4)2 < 70 GeV. They are efficient to control the whole backgrounds, especially the ttW , ttZ, and WWW backgrounds. As 2 \u2192 3 scattering processes, these backgrounds yield wide opening angles, which fail the final four selections. The ZZ and hSMZ backgrounds also prefer wide opening angles because of lighter masses of Z and hSM than H and A. About 80% of these two backgrounds are removed.\nAfter all of the above selections, 6.04 signal events and 1.46 background events (mostly ZZ background) are left. The significance without the background uncertainty is 3.53. If we include 10% background uncertainty, the significance slightly reduces to 3.48. Marginally, the HL-LHC can probe the light H\u00b1 through the signal of two same-sign charged leptons and two same-sign hadronic \u03c4 \u2019s in the [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]WW final state.\nC. [bbW ][bbW ]\nThe [bbW ][bbW ] process targets the production of a pair of charged Higgs bosons, followed\nby H\u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1(\u2217)\npp(qq\u0304/gg)\u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 AW+AW\u2212 \u2192 bb\u0304`+\u03bd`bb\u0304qq\u0304\u2032 + C.C. (25)\nWe consider the benchmark point BP\u20133 in Table III where the cross sections for the signal process are\nBP\u20133: \u03c3(qq\u0304 \u2192 H+H\u2212) = 185.4 fb, \u03c3(gg \u2192 H+H\u2212) = 25.6 fb. (26)\nThe cross section of loop-induced gluon fusion production is about 10% of the Drell-Yan production cross section. For the decay of WW , we consider the semi-leptonic decays. Then the backgrounds are as follows:\n\u2022 pp \u2192 hSM(\u2192 bb\u0304)V + jets where the jets from the QCD showering are misidentified as b jets;\n\u2022 pp\u2192 tV + tt\u0304hSM + tt\u0304V ;\n\u2022 V V \u2032 + jets;\n\u2022 ZZ + bb\u0304;\n\u2022 tt\u0304+ jets.\nAt the LHC, [bbW ][bbW ] is the most challenging process to probe the light H\u00b1 in type-I. The signal significance at the final selection shall be shown to be very small, far below the discovery level. Nevertheless, we present our investigation of all the available kinematic distributions and the effects of various kinematic cuts, hoping they help the future study. Some of the key distributions are shown in Fig. 10. First, we apply the \u201cBasic cuts\u201d, consisting of three selections.\n\u2013 We select events if they contain exactly one charged lepton with p`T > 25 GeV and\n|\u03b7| < 2.5.\n\u2013 We apply a veto on hadronically decaying tau leptons. Events should not contain any \u03c4h\nwith pT > 20 GeV.\n\u2013 EmissT > 30 GeV.\nAfter the basic cut, the signal significance without the background uncertainty is 4.81. As soon as we include the background uncertainty, however, the significance drops quickly, e.g., into 0.03 with \u2206bg = 1%. We need to reduce the background events.\nWe impose the cuts on the number of jets and b jets, Nj \u2265 4 and Nb \u2265 2, which is a key discriminator between the signal and background. In the signal, the number of jets is at least six wherein four of them are b jets. But a large portion of the b jets from a light A are too soft to pass the jet selection threshold. Therefore, we impose a looser jet selection such that the events contain at least four jets and at least two b\u2013jets. This selection, by itself, reduces the number of tt\u0304 events by a factor of 4 and the signal by a factor of 8.\nThe charged lepton in the signal comes from the W decay. To take the full advantage of the feature, we pair the charged lepton with the missing transverse energy and construct the transverse mass MWT , defined by\nMWT = \u221a 2|p`T ||EmissT | \u00d7 (1\u2212 cos \u2206\u03c6), (27)\nwhere \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c6` \u2212 \u03c6miss. We require MWT < 150 GeV. But it is not efficient since the charged lepton in the backgrounds involving top quarks comes from W also. Another characteristic of the signal is that two b jets come from a common ancestor. In the background, they are from different ancestors. We impose a condition on the invariant mass of the leading b jet (b1) and the subleading b jet (b2) such that Mb1b2 < 100 GeV. This selection is effective to suppress the tt\u0304+ jets (from \u223c 54M events to \u223c 20M events). Further requirements are on the transverse momenta of the charged lepton and jets. First, we select events if the transverse momentum of the leading charged lepton is smaller than 350 GeV. Second, we require that the transverse momentum of a jet be smaller than pj,maxT , defined by pj,maxT = 500, 350, 250, 150 GeV for the leading, subleading, third, and fourth jet, respectively, regardless of whether they are b\u2013tagged or not. Unfortunately, the cuts on p`,jT hardly separate the signal from the backgrounds since basically the shapes of the p`,jT distributions are very similar: see the top panels in Fig. 10.\nNow we investigate the scalar sum of transverse momenta of jets, defined by\nHT = \u2211\ni\u2208jets piT , (28)\nof which the distributions for the signal and backgrounds are in the bottom-left panel of Fig. 10. The background processes produce a hard HT spectrum, while the signal has a softer spectrum. With the hope that some correlations of various energy observations (such as EmissT and the effective mass Meff) to HT may suppress the backgrounds, we examine the distributions of EmissT /HT , (E miss T + p ` T )/HT , E miss T /Meff , and ( EmissT + p ` T ) /Meff . Here Meff = p ` T + E miss T +HT . Since all of them give almost the same results, we choose EmissT /HT < 0.7 as a representative: see the bottom-right panel of Fig. 10.\nSince the backgrounds involving tt\u0304 are still dominant, we further apply a top quark veto. Aiming at hadronically decaying top quark candidates, we construct W -candidates from any\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 (GeV)lep\nT p\n1\n10\n210\n310\n410\n510\n610\n710\n810\nN um\nbe r o\nf e ve\nnt s\nZZbb HV +H/W/Ztt tV VV +Xtt (gg) - BP3 \u00b1 H\u00b1H (qq) - BP3 \u00b1 H\u00b1H\nEmissT [GeV] R(`, \u2327)1 p `(lead) T [GeV] M(`, \u2327)2 [GeV]\nMH\u00b1 = 110 GeV MH\u00b1 = 140 GeV BR(H !

The charged lepton is then paired with the missing transverse energy to construct the transverse mass\np j(lead) T [GeV]\nwhile they come from a common ancestor in the signal process (most of the time). Further requirements are imposed on the transverse momentum of the charged lepton and jets in the events. First, we select events if the leading charged lepton transverse momentum is smaller than 350 GeV. Second, we require that the transverse momentum of the jets in the event to be smaller than pmaxT with p max T = 500, 350, 250, 150 GeV for the leading, subleading, third and fourth jet in the event regardless whether they are b\u2013tagged or not.

The backgrounds shown here correspond to ZZbb (white), HV (blue), tt\u0304+H/W/Z (green), tV (red), V V (magenta) and tt\u0304+ jets (dark green).

Next, we select hadronically decaying charged Higgs candidates. First, we construct two dijet systems, jj from the decay of the W -boson and bb from the decay of A. The dijet is formed if two jets are within \u2206R < 1.5. The two dijets, jj and bb\u0304, are then combined to form a charged Higgs candidate, while the bb\u0304 dijet system is to form A. Combining these, we require\n|Mjjbb \u2212MH\u00b1| < 10 GeV, |Mbb \u2212MA| < 10 GeV. (30)\nFinally we demand that the HT variable be smaller than 400 GeV.\nThe last discussion is on categorizing the events according to the number of b jets. At the end of the selection (HT < 400 GeV), 236 signal events remained in the Nb = 2 region, 57 events in the Nb = 3 region and 14 events in the Nb = 4 region. The resulting significance is very small, about 0.2\u20130.4 after these selections. It turns out that more work is needed to refine the selection and to enhance the significance using deep-learning algorithms for example. Furthermore, we expect better perspective at electron-positron colliders at \u221a s = 250 GeV where we expect almost background free environment, thanks to the absence of tt\u0304 backgrounds.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIn the framework of the type-I 2HDM, we have comprehensively studied the phenomenology to set a full roadmap for the light charged Higgs boson. The existing constraint of b\u2192 s\u03b3 puts a very stringent lower bound on the mass of the charged Higgs boson in type-II and type-Y, as MH\u00b1 & 800 GeV [7]. That is why we focus on type-I here. Imposing the light mass for the charged Higgs boson severely limits type-I, even without any assumptions on the model parameters, because of existing electroweak precision data, Higgs data, b \u2192 s\u03b3, and direct searches at the LEP, Tevatron, and LHC. The masses and couplings of the other Higgs bosons, A and H, are considerably restricted: (i) MA and MH are below about 570 GeV; (ii) there is a significant correlation between MA and MH (e.g., MA and MH cannot be simultaneously heavy); (iii) a light MA allows small tan \u03b2; (iv) the current data still permit substantial deviation from the Higgs alignment.\nWe rummaged among the finally allowed parameter space and found that the critical parameter is the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson A. When AW\u00b1 is beyond the decay threshold of the charged Higgs boson, H\u00b1 decays into a fermion pair, mainly into \u03c4\u00b1\u03bd. Since only large tan \u03b2(& 10) is allowed when MA is heavy, the conventional production channel in the search for the light H\u00b1, via the top quark decay, is not helpful. We found that the pair production of charged Higgs bosons has higher discovery potential. The associated production of H and A, followed by H/A \u2192 H\u00b1W\u2213, is also efficient to probe the light H\u00b1. When AW\u00b1 is below the decay threshold of the charged Higgs boson, H\u00b1 will mostly decay into AW\u00b1 and A into bb\u0304. Based on these characteristics, we assessed the detection significance of light charged Higgs bosons in three final states, [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd], [\u03c4\u03bd][\u03c4\u03bd]`\u00b1\u03bd`\u00b1\u03bd, and [bb\u0304W ][bb\u0304W ]. While we enjoy a large significance for the first final state and a reasonable significance for the second final state, the last one suffers from huge tt\u0304 related backgrounds.\nBefore we close, a few comments are offered as follows:\n1. The decay of the charged Higgs boson into AW\u00b1 depends on the gauge coupling, which\nis independent of Yukawa couplings, in contrast to fermionic decays. Once kinematically allowed, therefore, H\u00b1 \u2192 AW\u00b1 dominates over the fermionic modes. Thus, the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson is a crucial factor in searching for the charged Higgs boson.\n2. The golden channel for the light Higgs boson is pp \u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 [\u03c4+\u03bd] [\u03c4\u2212\u03bd\u0304] when the\ndecay into AW\u00b1 is kinematically suppressed. Its signal rate enjoys a large significance. The benchmark point BP\u20131 that we illustrated gives a typical size of the cross sections in the allowed parameter space, thus the significance of other allowed parameter sets would not be substantially different. New techniques for improving the \u03c4\u2013tagging using multivariate discriminants and the measurement of the \u03c4 charge will further enhance the significance.\n3. On the other hand, when the decay into AW\u00b1 is kinematically allowed, the decay chain\npp \u2192 H+H\u2212 \u2192 [AW+] [AW\u2212] \u2192 [bb\u0304`+\u03bd] [bb\u0304qq] is dominant in type-I but suffers the huge background from tt\u0304+jets. For this case, we do not get any significant sensitivity. We notice that this channel can be tested in the future electron-positron colliders at center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV due to the absence of the tt\u0304 backgrounds.\nAcknowledgments\nK.C. would like to thank Professor Wai-Yee Keung of University of Illinois at Chicago for hospitality.
