While these properties of larger counterparts are well dened, the nanoparticles are still poorly understood.1\u20133 Magnetite nanoparticles are especially relevant due to their applications in chemistry, energy, environment, agriculture and electronics. For example, magnetite nanoparticles have the ability to remediate numerous pollutants, such as heavy metals (lead, chromium, etc.), methylene blue, methyl orange, malachite green, and total nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, and have antifungal and antibacterial properties.4\u20136\nWell established methods of synthesizing nanoparticles require hazardous chemicals and physical conditions such as\nto de Geof\u0301\u0131sica, Universidad Nacional 510, Mexico stitute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur,\nuto de Geof\u0301\u0131sica, Universidad Nacional 510, Mexico tion (ESI) available.

Thus, nature inspired synthesis procedures need to be established and developed.3,7,8 To the best of our knowledge such methods for preparing magnetic nanoparticle aggregates (MNAs) have not yet been well established. Our study, thus, investigates the natural origin and genesis of MNAs found in the Pe\u00f1a Colorada iron-ore deposit. This iron-ore mine is located at the Pacic continental margin in southern Mexico (Fig. 1). It is the main iron-ore and pellet producer in Mexico. The main Fe-ore is magnetite, which is being mined since 1975.9 We identied natural magnetite nanoparticles that form dense MNAs. Within the MNAs, the open spaces are lled mostly with berthierine, (Fe, Mg, Al)6(Si, Al, Fe)4O10(OH)8, and in minor proportion by calcite, quartz, apatite, cryptocrystalline and colloidal silica, hematite, siderite, feldspar, pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, marmatite, galena, covellite, native gold and argentite.10,11\nThe MNAs were initially reported rst during the mine exploitation activities in 1987.12,13 In these MNAs, magnetite nanoparticles are embedded in the berthierinematrix (Fig. 2).2,14,15 Smaller MNAs, <200 nm, with a Curie temperature of 650 \u00b0C, shows superparamagnetic behavior.

They were used as reference material for the rst set. Third, were the MNAs synthesized in lab. These were extracted in the form of berthierine lms/lamellae. These lms were used for synthesizing MNAs in laboratory conditions that mimic the natural environment during formation.

For grain size analysis MNAs were separated into different sizes through a granulometric classication using a WarmanM8 cyclosizer equipment, sub-sieve sizer.2 This instrument classies and separates the particles as a function of the size through centrifugal force under controlled conditions (water temperature, density of the dry sample, ux and time of feeding, etc.). MNA fractions were separated into size ranges: 56\u201330 mm, 30\u201322 mm, 22\u201315 mm, 15\u201310 mm, 10\u20137 mm and 7\u20130.1 mm. A few smaller MNAs, 2 to 15 nm in size, were also obtained. Then the effects of temperature on MNAs were analyzed using optical microscopy, differential thermal and gravimetric analysis (DTAGTA), Xray diffractometry (XRD), electron microprobe (EPMA), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Magnetic characterization was done by analysing the changes in magnetic susceptibility with frequency (cFD%) and high-temperature (thermomagnetic), and by investigating the changes in magnetisation with applied eld (hysteresis).\nLight microscopy was done on a Leica MZ 7.5 stereoscope microscope a Leica DMLP polarizing microscope. XRD was done with Bruker D-8 advance with Cu Ka and l = 1.5418 \u00c5 radiation and graphite monochromator. Diffplus B-S soware and international crystal powder diffraction (ICPD) database. Electron probe X-ray micro-analyses was done using JEOL JXA 8900-R with dispersive energy spectrometers of X-ray wavelength (WDS) standards SPI#02753-AB. DTA-GTA analyses using a Shimatsu ATR at room conditions with 70 mg sample under temperature from 19 \u00b0C to 1100 \u00b0C and an interval of 1 \u00b0C per minute. HRTEM was done with a JEOL 2010 FEG FASTEM.\ncFD% and thermomagnetic measurements were done using a Bartington MS2 with an MS2W sensor, coupled to a furnace MS2WFP. Low and high frequency of 470 Hz and 4700 Hz were used for cFD% measurements, which are especially useful to distinguish ultrane magnetite grain with superparamagnetic (SP) behavior. During thermomagnetic measurements the samples were heated in air from room temperature to 700 \u00b0C and then cooled back. The magnetic susceptibility is measured during the entire process of heating and cooling. Hysteresis was determined using small core-chips measured in a Princeton Instrument AGFM 2900 (MicroMag) employing a maximum applied eld of up to 1.5 T."

SEM and HRTEM reveal that the MNAs are comprised of spherical magnetite nanoparticles, 2 nm to 15 nm in size (Fig. 2 and 3) and show cubic-octahedra and tetrahedra crystalline structure.19 The intergranular material around the nanoparticles contains ca. 65% nanoscopic magnetite, ca. 30% berthierine, and ca. <5% associated minerals, which include, in\n32056 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32054\u201332062\norder of decreasing proportion, granular quartz, amorphous colloidal silica, calcite, siderite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, marmatite, pyrrhotite, feldspar, apatite, sphene, native gold, argentite and organic matter. Berthierine is silky and occurs in low structural order, between amorphous to ne crystalline. The MNAs are occasionally cut by calcite veinlets, up to 20 mm thick, with apatite inclusions. Some MNAs are wrapped by up to a 35 mm thick layer of suldes.\nThe XRD spectrum analysis (Fig. 4) reveals intense magnetite peaks corresponding to (220) d = 3.00 \u00c5, (311) d = 2.55 \u00c5, (111) d = 4.90 and (222) with d = 2.43 \u00c5. Berthierine peaks correspond to (001) with d = 7.12 \u00c5 and (002) with d = 3.55 \u00c5. The magnetite peaks are irregularly shaped with wide base, indicating a signicant contribution from nanometer-scale grains.2\nThe M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum of the intergranular material around the nanoparticles (Fig. 5), shows six spectra doublets, typical of magnetite. The Fe3O4 molecule is in two magnetic states: ferromagnetic state indicated by a sextuple spectrum, corresponding to the micrometric size magnetite aggregates >0.2 mm; and superparamagnetic state represented by a doublet spectrum corresponding to the MNAs of nanometer-scale <200 nm. The magnetic state of the MNAs depends strongly on their degree of compaction.\nThe chemical properties of the MNAs obtained by WDS multi-elemental analysis in selected elds (ESI Table 1\u2020) reveals Fe3+ = 15.59 to 15.69 wt% and Fe2+ ions= 7.78 to 7.83 wt%, and elemental trace impurities (<0.2 wt%) of Mn, Ca, Mg, Ti, Al, V, Si, Na and K.\nLaboratory synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles\nWe performed laboratory experiments, on berthierine thin lms, that mimic the natural environment favourable for magnetite nanocrystals and MNA synthesis.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The lms were annealed at 360, 495, 510, 570, 650 and 750 \u00b0C (Fig. 6), and the changes were characterized. Initially at the room temperature, the XRD pattern reveals distinct (001) and (002) peaks of berthierine, which have a d value of 7.18 \u00c5 and 3.55 \u00c5, respectively. The XRD pattern also presents (311) and (222) magnetite peaks, with d value of 2.53 \u00c5 and 2.15 \u00c5, respectively.\nExothermic reactions at 360 \u00b0C and 495 \u00b0C (Fig. 6) mark dehydration of magnetite nanoparticles and berthierine, respectively. Due to the dehydration, at 360 \u00b0C, the intensity of (001) and (002) berthierine peaks decreases (Fig. 8). Endothermic dehydration at 430 \u00b0C and 550\u2013558 \u00b0C (Fig. 6) lead to loss of crystallinity. The berthierine samples, aer heating up to 495\u2013550 \u00b0C for 2 hours, lose their crystallinity and transform in an amorphous colloid.\nIntense exothermic reactions at ca. 650 \u00b0C is owed to formation of new magnetite nanoparticles and growth of preexistent magnetite nanoparticles to over 10 nm. These larger nanoparticles saturate the colloid favoring their contact and subsequent aggregation (Fig. 7). New magnetite nanoparticles are represented by novel XRD peaks in the spectra (Fig. 8a) compared to the original (Fig. 4).

These interplanar distances are consistent with those reported for magnetite.20 HRTEM and FFT analyses of these nanoparticles reveals absence of crystal defects and signicative structure transformation. This explain their resistance to oxidation and a high Tc.\nAer the rst annealing at 650 \u00b0C, we apply second annealing at the same (650 \u00b0C) temperature to explore the repeatability of the procedure (ESI Table 2\u2020). XRD reveals similar results (Fig. 8c) and underlines the repeatability of the experiment.\nFurther annealing at 750 \u00b0C leads to oxidation of some magnetite to maghemite. The formation of maghemite is marked by a decrease in intensity of the (311) magnetite peak at 2q angle of 35\u00b0 (compare Fig. 8a with b). Newly formed maghemite is represented in HRTEM image by crystallites having interplanar distance d1 = 2.00 \u00c5, d2 = 2.53 \u00c5, d3 = 3.79 \u00c5, corresponding to the (400), (311) and (210) planes, respectively (Fig. 9b and c).

The DTA and GTA analyses reveal marked differences between reference magnetite, 56\u201330 mm and natural MNAs recovered from the iron-ores. The reference magnetite presents two exothermic reactions at 375 and 615 \u00b0C. The rst one corresponds to magnetite changing to maghemite due to oxidation and the second one represents maghemite transforming to hematite (Fig. 10a). The GTA analysis shows a weight loss aer 200 \u00b0C and weight gain aer 615 \u00b0C.\nIn contrast, the MNAs (Fig. 10b) reveal four well dened exothermic reactions at 360 \u00b0C (exo-medium), 465 \u00b0C (exo-very small), 635 \u00b0C (exo-large) and 750 \u00b0C (exo-large). The rst exothermic reaction, at 360 \u00b0C, is owed to partial oxidation and transformation (along the grain boundaries) of magnetite nanoparticles to maghemite (ESI Fig. 1a\u2020). Although the phase change occurs over a wider temperature range 276 to 382 \u00b0C, it peaks at 360 \u00b0C and is accompanied with 1.14% weight loss. Transformation of magnetite to maghemite is slow process. It requires longer exposers at a specic temperature for oxidation to reach from the crust of the grain to its core. The second, slightly exothermic reaction at 485 \u00b0C is marked with a slight bump in the DTA curve. This reaction indicates starting of oxidation MNA core to maghemite.\nThe high exothermic reactions at 635 \u00b0C occur by transformation of the crust of MNAs, formed of maghemite, to hematite (g-Fe2O3 / a-Fe2O3), while their core remains maghemite. The DTA curve shows wide amplitude in the interval 600 to 675 \u00b0C (Fig. 10b), supporting the loss of weight as showed in the GTA curve. Optical microscopy and XRD of MNAs annealed at 650 \u00b0C reveal a magnetite core, a surrounding layer of maghemite and outermost layer of hematite. The largest MNAs, thus, do not oxidize completely at 650 \u00b0C.\n32058 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32054\u201332062\nIn summary, the oxidation front moves slowly towards the interior of the MNAs with gradually increasing temperature from 380 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C (ESI Fig. 1b\u2020). At 750 \u00b0C the core of the MNAs are transformed to maghemite, marked by the peak in the DTA-GTA spectrum (Fig. 7b). This is in contrast to the standard magnetite that oxidises to hematite at 615 \u00b0C. The oxidation of MNA core at 750 \u00b0C is accompanied by a gain in weight of 1.14%. Continued heating till 1100 \u00b0C causes complete transformation of MNAs to hematite and a weight gain of 8.18%.\nMagnetic susceptibility vs. frequency measurements. These measurements were done on intergranular material and MNAs annealed at 650 \u00b0C, 650 \u00b0C (in second run) and 750 \u00b0C. The initial cFD%, 13%, of natural berthierine concentrate without annealing,8 decrease to 7.6% aer annealing at 650 \u00b0C (ESI\nFig. 9 HRTEM analysis (A) magnetite nanoparticle embedded in colloida before annealing.

Heating curves of MNAs do not show any remarkable change in susceptibility up to 350 \u00b0 C (Fig. 11). The rst Curie temperature (Tc) is encountered at 350\u2013380 \u00b0C indicating maghemite,22,28,29 which is produced from the transformation of magnetite nanoparticles.23 All MNA sample show moderate to strong Hopkinson peak at c. 580 \u00b0C. Hopkinson peak can be attributed to abundance of smaller magnetite grains. At temperatures above the magnetite Tc, the thermomagnetic curves are reversible with the colling branch presenting the same shape as the heating branch (Fig. 11). Between magnetite Tc and room temperature, the cooling branch of the thermomagnetic curves presents lower magnetic susceptibility than the heating branch. Notably, the samples with smaller magnetite grain size show lower average magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 11). The smaller magnetite grains are unoxidized cores of the larger MNAs.\nMNA samples with largest grain size, 56 to 19 mm, annealed at 380 \u00b0C, have maghemite at boundaries with magnetite at the core (Fig. 1a, ESI\u2020). With increasing annealing temperature, maghemite proportions increase. This is evident in the heating branch of thermomagnetic curves, where the maghemite Tc, between 350\u2013380 \u00b0C becomes more prominent with the with increasing heat treatment (Fig. 11)."

At 495 \u00b0C changes initiate in berthierine with further dehydration and the structural transformation to an amorphous colloid. This transformation is complete at 550\u2013558 \u00b0C. At 635 \u00b0C, new magnetite nanoparticles form, while pre-existing magnetite nanoparticles grow rapidly. At 650 \u00b0C, magnetite nanoparticles continue to grow beyond 10 nm. These nanoparticles saturate the colloid, favouring the contact and aggregation to form MNAs. Another annealing at 650 \u00b0C, done to check the reproducibility, presents similar results (ESI Table 2\u2020). With further heating to higher temperature of 750 \u00b0C, some magnetite in the MNAs starts to oxidize to maghemite along the boundaries. At 780 \u00b0C the oxidation along the outer boundaries is complete leading to development of hematite.\nThis laboratory synthesis is analogous to enrichment of berthierine inmarine environment, where, colloidal berthierine is constantly enriched with Fe from external sources such as marine chimneys that discharge Fe-rich brines. The increasing of temperature during the experiment mimics the temperature increase due to the hydrothermal pulses and works in favor of nucleation and growth of magnetite nanoparticles, which later form MNAs.\nEffect of temperature on the reference magnetite and natural MNAs\nDTA-GTA analysis highlights the differences in the behaviour of natural MNAs from the Pe\u00f1a Colorada (Fig. 10b) with respect to the reference material, concentrate of 56\u201330 mm size magnetite crystals (Fig. 10a).\nFirstly, the reference magnetite shows three well-dened exothermic reactions at 285 \u00b0C, 375 \u00b0C and 615 \u00b0C (Fig. 10a) during its complete change to maghemite and later to hematite, Fe3O4 / g-Fe2O3 / a-Fe2O3. On the contrary, the MNAs reveal four well-dened exothermic reactions at 360 \u00b0C, 485 \u00b0C, 635 \u00b0C, 750 \u00b0C (Fig. 7b). The rst two correspond to partial oxidation to maghemite and hematite, respectively, and the last two reactions (465 \u00b0C and 750 \u00b0C), perhaps to the complete oxidation. The MNAs start to lose weight from 200 \u00b0C to 727 \u00b0C and thereaer gain weight due to the growth of magnetite nanoparticles up to 1050 \u00b0C.\nSecondly, the reference material presents a Tc of 580 \u00b0C, which agrees with the published Curie point for pure magnetite.30 Whereas, Tc of the MNAs is >650 \u00b0C, which may due to hematite.\nTo summarize, the thermal reactions in reference magnetite initiate at lower temperatures and progress rapidly, while in the MNAs thermal reactions initiate at higher temperatures and progress slowly according, demonstrating the heat resistance of MNAs.\nImplications on the genesis of MNAs in nature\nThe synthesis of MNAs takes three steps: (1) nucleation and growth of numerous stable crystalline magnetite nanoparticles homogeneously distributed in a colloidal berthierine matrix starts at 635 \u00b0C. (2) With increasing temperature, to 650 \u00b0C, the nucleation accelerates, and the pre-existing nanoparticles grow.

(3) Constant temperatures of 650 \u00b0C lead to the continuous growth of magnetite nanoparticles. Space restrictions lead to the formation of dense MNAs less than 200 nm in size.\nIn marine conditions, berthierine is formed by colloidal diagenetic processes. Supply of heat and iron from hydrothermal solutions coming out of marine chimneys31 could spark a series of reactions and physicochemical adjustments in composition to form the MNAs."

            "text": "The properties of MNAs are size-dependent. Magnetite MNAs, which are larger than 7 mm, start to transform to maghemite in the range of 280 \u00b0C to 380 \u00b0C and then to hematite at 615 \u00b0C. In contrast, the smaller MNAs, <0.2 mm, are more resistant to temperature induced oxidation and transformation. They show changes to hematite at temperatures >750 \u00b0C. The larger MNAs are ferromagnetic, while the smaller ones are superparamagnetic.\nMost notably, our laboratory experiments that mimicked natural conditions and were able to successfully nucleate and grow magnetite nanoparticles which developed into MNAs. The MNAs were similar to those recovered from the Pe\u00f1a Colorada iron-ore deposit. This study provides a nature inspired method for synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles and its aggregates which do not require harmful chemicals and the starting material is also naturally derived.\nThe physical and chemical settings of the experiments allow the prediction of the environmental conditions for the formation of the natural magnetite nanoparticle aggregates. It is suggested that the magnetic nanoparticle aggregates at the Pe\u00f1a Colorada iron mine developed in shallow to a deepmarine environment with redox conditions. This was facilitated by Fe rich hydrothermal source such as marine chimneys. Because of\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
