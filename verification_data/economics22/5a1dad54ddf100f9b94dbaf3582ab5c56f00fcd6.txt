"The evidence suggests potential pathways between behavioural changes and localised networks together contributing to improvements in wellbeing. The social and behavioural change aspects within the EWV curricula enhanced participant agency, encouraged households to work together with others primarily in terms of economic engagement, and strengthened their ability to plan livelihoods and contingencies. At the household level, social resilience involved improved collaboration in child and spousal relationships. Beyond the household level, these relational attributes extended to a stronger propensity to engage in savings groups and group-based farming. In these efforts, the identity and vision components of EWV helped individuals exert agency in deciding together how to strengthen livelihoods to help improve human development outcomes of children. Moreover, the cognitive social resilience components (e.g. confidence, agency, decision-making, and propensity to collaborate) strengthened through opportunities for collaborative activities meant that when emergencies did strike, households were able to more easily draw on pre-established networks to help smooth consumption and needs of children."
