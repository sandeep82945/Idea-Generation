Mark Dayan, 1 Tamara Hervey, 2 Mark Flear3\nEver since the famous Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed to avoid ahardborder on the islandof Ireland, a shadow of doubt has hung over the health service in Northern Ireland (NI). The Protocol meant NI largely stayed within the EU single market for physical products, while Great Britain (GB) left. But NI receives 80% of its medicines from the other parts of the UK.1\nThe Windsor Framework, which was announced on 27 February, passed its key vote in the House of CommonsonWednesday 22Marchandhasnowbeen adopted by the UK government, includes a proposed EU Regulation specifically for medicines.2 3 This largely removes the concerns of shortages resulting from these barriers, or medicines used elsewhere in the UK missing from shelves in Belfast.

            "text": "The EU already acted last year to remove one major immediate source of worry for suppliers and users of medicine in NI\u2014the threat that medicines tested for compliance in GB would not be valid for use.4\nArticle 3 of the proposed new Regulation will eliminate another: the threat that after a grace period ended, suppliers would need to start removing EU security tags and identifiers when a product entered GB, only to reapply new ones when it crossed the Irish Sea.5 A House of Lords Committee recently described this as \u201cthe single biggest factor causing difficulties under the Protocol.\u201d The Regulation simply removes this system for NI from 1 January 2025\u2014or earlier if the UK provides the European Commission with written guarantees of compliance in areas such as labelling.\nEvenmore radically, thenewproposalswould remove the main long term concern for medicines supply in NI: the prospect of not having access to products available in other parts of the UK. Driven by growing divergence in authorisations,which our recent report showed had slowly started to emerge, this was a source of concern among healthcare and medical officials we spoke to, both for cutting-edge drugs and for more inexpensive products where a wide range of suppliers helps guard against price rises and shortages.1 6\nThis was the result of NI remaining subject to the approvals system formedicineswithin theEU\u2019s single market. Under Article 4 of the Regulation, NI will in future simply usemedicines approvedby theUK. The UK has accepted rules that require monitoring, effective sanctions and reporting."

            "text": "The shift to UK medicine authorisations means a prohibition on placing new medicines with EU authorisation on the Northern Irish market. Health and social care services do not get to \u201cpick and choose.\u201d\nThis may mean NI gets later access to cutting-edge products than people over the border. Recently, the EuropeanMedicinesAgency (EMA)hasbeencentrally approvingnewproducts faster than itsUKequivalent, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).7 This may be because the latter is understaffed or underfunded now that it no longer has access to paid work from the EMA\u2014a regular industry complaint.\nTransitional rules will apply to medicines already on the market, which can be sold in NI until their expiry date. But this does not apply to authorisations that took place after the UK left the single market on 31 December 2020. MHRA will need to catch up to EMA approvals to avoid a risk of availablemedicines being cut off. While in theory it already has a policy of generally accepting EU approvals, its capacity problems may make this difficult to achieve.8 Moreover, new labelling rules apply, requiring medicines for NI to have a label that includes the words \u201cUKonly,\u201dwhichwill adda small but real cost.\nNInowhasavery complex statuswhereEUmedicines laws apply, but with huge exemptions and another jurisdiction, the UK, taking over the central role of authorisation. This does carry some risks. For example, what if in the future, the UK were to stop conducting batch testing to the standards still required for NI under EU law? Would there be confusing dual systems, or might the EU explore options to suspend bits of the agreement?\nMore than just medicines The Protocol also subjects many products entering NI from GB to customs checks, designed to protect the EU system of tariffs and quotas against imports through the back door. A new decision as part of the Framework will expand an exemption for goods if they are used in NI for the sole purpose of providing health or care. Now, even if the importer sells products on to one \u201csubsequent entity\u201d\u2014such as a hospital\u2014to use the goods for care, they would not be subject to full customs formalities.\nMeanwhile, a \u201ctrusted trader scheme,\u201d will assist with the supply of products that are sold to or used by consumers in NI.\nIn respect of food law, the Framework effectively means EU legislation on, for example, food intended for infants and young children, food for special\n1the bmj | BMJ 2023;381:p825 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.p825\nOPINION\n1 Nuffield Trust\n2 City University\n3 School of Law, Queen's University Belfast\nCite this as: BMJ 2023;381:p825\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.p825\nPublished: 11 April 2023\ncopyright. on 13 January 2024 at Indian Institute of T\nechnology P atna (IIT P atna).

However, such retail goods moving into NI from GB would become subject to specific rules to ensure they remain in NI\u2014covering areas like certification and checks, consumer information and traceability.\nBeyondmedicines,many other crucial health products and services are unaffected. EU law on medical devices still applies in NI\u2014likely less of an issue, because we heard during our research that most come from the EU, not GB.1 But there is also no answer on the knotty issue of UK and EU professional qualifications no longer being recognised by the other side: a real issue for those clinicians who work across the border, splitting their time or in mobile services like ambulances."

            "text": "The Windsor Framework is not fully politically settled, with the Democratic Unionist Party having refused to vote for it, and holding out the continued threat of refusing to re-enter the devolved government at Stormont. Even though it has now been passed, it is designed for change, and even to manage conflict.\nThenew \u201cStormont brake,\u201d the focus of the recent vote,would allow the UK on petition of the NI Assembly to block new EU rules on products, potentially increasing divergence. EU regulations will be subject to oversight by the Court of Justice of the EU which applies to the UK in perpetuity. The European Commission has monitoring powers, and there is a procedure for it to suspend thenewprovisions and take remedial action if the UK breaks its commitments, including where practices become too different.\nIf new rules on labelling and traceability were not required in GB, thiswould add a small but real regulatory burden and cost to supply of medicines in NI. But this could also set a course for cooperation. The complicated shared legal framework for medicines in NI could be a first step towards expanded mutual recognition between the whole UK and the EU. This would be beneficial for patients in both, offering global suppliers a larger, more appealing regulatory space.\nWhether this is the latest stage in a twisting drama of health, Brexit and Northern Ireland, or the start of a more stable course for the whole UK, is still to be decided.\nCompeting interests: none declared.\nProvenance and peer review: not commissioned, not externally peer reviewed.\n1 Nuffield Trust.
