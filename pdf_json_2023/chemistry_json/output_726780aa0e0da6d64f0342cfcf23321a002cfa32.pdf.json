    "abstractText": "In this work, acetone gas sensors were fabricated using pre-annealing metal oxide zinc oxide (pa-ZnO)-doped perovskite cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3). The ZnO nanopowder, before it was doped into CsPbBr3 solution, was first put into a furnace to anneal at different temperatures, and formed the pa-ZnO. The properties of pa-ZnO were different from ZnO. The optimized doping conditions were 2 mg of pa-ZnO nanopowder and pre-annealing at 300 \u25e6C. Under these conditions, the highest sensitivity (gas signal current-to-air background current ratio) of the ZnO-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite acetone sensor was 1726. In addition, for the limit test, 100 ppm was the limit of detection of the ZnO-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite acetone sensor and the sensitivity was 101.",

            "text": "There are more than 3500 chemical components in the breath exhaled by the human body, most of which are volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Among the breath VOCs, acetone is a by-product of lipid metabolism that is closely related to blood glucose levels. Acetone in exhaled breath can thus monitor the metabolic state of the human body. Various techniques have been employed to measure the acetone of very low concentrations, such as gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, vacuum-free ion mobility spectrometry, laser absorption spectroscopy, and colorimetric sensors [1,2]. However, these techniques require bulky equipment and complex measurement procedures, making real-time monitoring impossible for widespread use throughout the human body. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a convenient and low-cost method to accurately detect acetone at extremely low concentrations. The boiling point and autoignition temperature of acetone are 56 \u25e6C and 465 \u25e6C, respectively. Metal oxide semiconductors are commonly used as sensor materials for sensing chemical gases, but they need to have good sensitivity in high-temperature environments, while perovskite can have a good gas sensing effect in room-temperature environments [3\u20138]. Halide perovskite materials have been widely used in light-emittingdiodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic devices due to their fascinating properties, including a high absorption coefficient, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and low non-radiative recombination rate [9\u201314], and as such, a lot of articles have published on LED and photovoltaic devices. In addition, owing to their excellent hydration\u2013dehydration, electronic transition, adsorption\u2013desorption, phase transition, and ion intercalaltion-decalationthe, the perovskite materials have a high sensitivity to the environment, such as temperature, humidity, VOC, etc., so perovskite materials are also suitable as environmental probes [15\u201320]. However, few articles have investigated their optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, acetone gas sensors made of zinc oxide (ZnO) had a good performance [8,21]. Therefore, in this study, complex materials of ZnO nanopowders and perovskites were prepared, and the\nSensors 2023, 23, 2164. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23042164 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 2164 2 of 9\nZnO nanopowders were annealed in a high-temperature furnace to increase their oxygen vacancies and conductivity, and then fabricated into a resistance-type acetone sensor with a high sensitivity when operated in room temperature."

Conclusions In this work, pa-ZnO-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite acetone sensors have been investigated. We have studied the morphology, absorption spectra, and XRD pattern of pa-ZnOdoped CsPbBr3 perovskite films for pre-annealing temperatures and doping amounts, respectively. The optimized pre-annealing temperature and doping amount are 300 \u00b0C and 2 mg of ZnO, respectively. According to the XPS spectra, the binding energy shifts with the amount of pa-ZnO nanopowder added. The effect this binding energy displacement may be that the atoms will be oxidized, the bond energy will be enhanced, and the oxidation will increase the binding energy of the inner layer electrons.

According to the XPS spectra, the binding energy shifts with the amount of pa-ZnO nanopowder added. The effect this binding energy displacement may be that the atoms will be oxidized, the bond energy will be enhanced, and the oxidation will increase the binding energy of the inner layer electrons. Under the treatment of the champion condition, the highest sensitivity of the pa-ZnO-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite acetone sensor is 1726. In addition, 100 ppm is the limit of detection of the pa-ZnO-doped\nSensors 2023, 23, 2164 8 of 9\nCsPbBr3 perovskite acetone sensor, and the sensitivity is 101. This work is not suitable for medical applications (1 ppm-level) [28\u201331]. However, the devices with an introduction of low-dimensional structure (quantum dots, nanorods, and nanosheets) may meet the requirement of biotechnology in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.-C.C. and K.-Y.L.; methodology, L.-C.C. and A.-N.S.; formal analysis, L.-C C.; investigation, L.-C.C. and K.-Y.L.; data curation, A.-N.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.-C.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.-C.C. and K.-Y.L.
