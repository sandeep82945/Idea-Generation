            "text": "In nonlinear elasticity, and, specifically, in the static theory, a fundamental problem is the existence of minimizers of the elastic energy\n\u222b\n\u2126\nW (x, u(x), Du(x)) dx (1)\nof a deformation u : \u2126 \u2192 Rn. Here \u2126 is an open bounded subset of Rn representing the reference configuration of the body (of course, only n = 3 is physicallly relevant), and W : \u2126\u00d7 Rn\u00d7n \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e} is the elastic stored-energy function of the material. In fact, the dependence on u(x) in (1) is not significant. The usual approach for finding such minimizers is the direct method of the Calculus of variations. As shown in the pioneering paper of Ball [3], the weak continuity of the determinant of the deformation gradient Du, and the assumption of polyconvexity of\n1\nW are the key ingredients to make the direct method work. The property of polyconvexity essentially means that W can be expressed as a convex function of the minors of the matrix Du.\nThis theory is by now well established. On the other hand, nonlocal models in solid mechanics have experienced a huge development in the last two decades, especially since the introduction of the peridynamics model by Silling [32]. This prominence is due among other things to the fact that their formulation usually allows for less regular functions, in particular functions exhibiting singularity phenomena. Many refinements have been introduced since then and, particularly, nonlocal models based on a nonlocal gradient have received a great attention as an adequate substitute of local models. In general, a nonlocal gradient of a function u : \u2126 \u2192 R takes the form\nG\u03c1u(x) =\n\u222b\n\u2126\nu(x)\u2212 u(y)\n|x\u2212 y|\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y| \u03c1(x\u2212 y) dy,\nfor a suitable kernel \u03c1, usually with a singularity at the origin. The choice of \u03c1 determines the nonlocal gradient, which, in turn, specifies the functional space.\nThe most popular nonlocal gradient is possibly Riesz\u2019 s-fractional gradient, which is denoted by Dsu and corresponds to the choices \u2126 = Rn and \u03c1(x) = cn,s\n|x|n\u22121+s for some constant cn,s; see\n[29, 30]. Here 0 < s < 1 is the degree of differentiability. While Riesz\u2019 fractional gradient enjoys many desirable properties (it is invariant under rotations and translations, it is s-homogeneous under dilations; see [31]), it has the drawback that the integral defining it is over the whole space, which makes it unsuitable for solid mechanics where the body is represented by a bounded domain \u2126 \u2282 Rn. An adaptation of Riesz\u2019 s-fractional gradient for bounded domains was done by the authors in [11]. Precisely, for a C\u221ec function u, its nonlocal gradient is defined as\nDs\u03b4u(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\nu(x)\u2212 u(y)\n|x\u2212 y|\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y|\nw\u03b4(x\u2212 y)\n|x\u2212 y|n\u22121+s dy,\nwhere w\u03b4 is a fixed function in C \u221e c (B(0, \u03b4)) satisfying some natural properties to be a truly cut-off function. The parameter \u03b4 > 0, called horizon in the context of peridynamics, indicates the maximum interaction distance.\nAlthough the definition of the Riesz gradient is rather old, it was the study [29, 30] that initiated the attention in the community of nonlocal problems in partial differential equations and Calculus of variations. In fact, they showed that the functional space consisting of the closure of smooth functions under the natural norm (given by the Lp norms of a function u and its fractional gradient Dsu) is the Bessel potential space Hs,p(Rn). They also proved a series of embeddings mimicking those of Sobolev spaces. As a consequence of their analysis, they proved the existence of minimizers for functionals of the form\n\u222b\nRn\nW (x, u(x), Dsu(x)) dx, (2)\nwhere u : Rn \u2192 R is scalar and W is convex in the last variable. The vectorial case, for u : Rn \u2192 Rm, was treated in [9] under the assumption of polyconvexity of W , and in [25] under the assumption of quasiconvexity.\nIn [11] we developed a framework for the nonlocal gradient Ds\u03b4u over bounded domains and its associated function space Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126), which roughly can be defined as the set of Lp functions u with Lp gradients Ds\u03b4u. In this paper we use that analysis and, additionally, take advantage of the large body of knowlegde on hyperelasticity based on polyconvexity developed in the last\nfour decades for functionals of the form (1). With these two ingredients we show the existence of minimizers of functionals\n\u222b\n\u2126\nW (x, u(x), Ds\u03b4u(x)) dx, (3)\nfor u : Rn \u2192 Rn under the assumption of polyconvexity of W . This article can be seen as the goal of the path shown in the thesis [15], following the articles [8, 9, 10, 11]: we first showed that the nonlinear bond-based description of peridynamics does not fit in solid mechanics, then we studied the energy functionals (2) based on the Riesz fractional gradient as an alternative (instead of the double integrals present in peridynamics), and finally we presented this similar framework over bounded domains (see (3)).\nIn order to obtain the theory of polyconvexity in this framework, one can follow two approaches. One is to obtain directly the necessary tools and follow the steps from the proofs of the local case, as was done by the authors in [9], where we developed the theory of polyconvexity for Riesz\u2019 fractional gradient. This procedure requires the validity of Piola\u2019s identity and the integration by parts of the determinant as preliminary steps to prove the weak continuity of minors, all in the fractional context.\nThe other approach starts from the observation that every nonlocal gradient is in fact a local one. This method was exploited in [25] for Riesz\u2019 fractional gradient to develop the theory of quasiconvexity in that context. In the fractional case, every fractional gradient coincides with the classical one of a locally Sobolev function: Dsu = D(Is \u2217 u), being Is the Riesz potential, which is Is(x) = 1 \u03b3(s)|x|n\u2212s\n, for some constant \u03b3(s). However, the fact that the property of compact support is not preserved under convolution, as well as the non-integrability of the Riesz potential makes it difficult to use this observation for obtaining fundamental results in the polyconvexity theory based on Riesz gradients. On the contrary, these two disadvantages are not present in the context of this paper, and that is why we adopt this approach here. Indeed, the starting point is the equality Ds\u03b4u = D(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 u) for a suitable kernel Q s \u03b4, which is integrable and of compact support. Therefore, this second method is fully operative for the polyconvexity theory in the context of the nonlocal gradient Ds\u03b4. In fact, we have found two advantages: first, that it is simpler and provides shorter proofs, whenever available. Second, and more importantly, that it gives rise to better integrability exponents, which results in weaker assumptions in the existence theorem. This second reason is supported by the sharp results that are available for the weak continuity of the determinant in the classical case, notably due to [28]. This sharpness of the exponents actually comes from the integration by parts of the determinant, since here it is written completely in terms of Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u, as opposed to the fractional case.\nIn a nutshell, the existence theory of polyconvexity is based on the weak continuity of the determinant, which in turn depends on the integration by parts of the determinant, which, in fact is founded on Piola\u2019s identity. In order to develop our existence theory we could just start from the weak continuity of the determinant, but we have preferred to prove Piola\u2019s identity and the integration by parts of the determinant as well, for the sake of completeness and also for comparison with the local case.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we recall from [11] the main results about the nonlocal gradient Ds\u03b4u, as well as its associated functional space H\ns,p,\u03b4(\u2126). In Section 3 we prove some properties of the nonlocal gradient and divergence, notably, the product formula. In Section 4 we comment on the fact that every nonlocal gradient is, in fact, a local one. This property is exploited in Section 5, where we prove the nonlocal versions of Piola\u2019s identity, the integration by parts of detDs\u03b4u and the weak continuity of detD s \u03b4u. Finally, in Section 6 we prove the existence of minimizers of functionals (3) with W polyconvex. We also\nshow the corresponding Euler\u2013Lagrange equation."

We also define the sets \u2126\u03b4 = \u2126+B(0, \u03b4), which plays the role of nonlocal closure, and \u2126B,\u03b4 = \u2126\u03b4 \\ \u2126, which plays the role of nonlocal boundary. We write B(x, r) to denote the open ball centred at x of radius r. The set \u2126\u2212\u03b4 := {x \u2208 \u2126 : dist(x, \u2202\u2126) > \u03b4} will also be relevant, where \u03b4 is chosen small enough so that \u2126\u2212\u03b4 is not empty.\nLet w\u03b4 : R n \u2192 [0,+\u221e) be a cut-off function, and \u03c1\u03b4 : R n \u2192 [0,+\u221e) defined as\n\u03c1\u03b4(x) = 1\n\u03b3(1\u2212 s)|x|n\u22121+s w\u03b4(x),\nwith 0 < s < 1, where the constant \u03b3(s) is given by\n\u03b3(s) = \u03c0\nn 2 2s\u0393 ( s 2 ) \u0393 (\nn\u2212s 2\n)\nand \u0393 is Euler\u2019s gamma function. The precise assumptions over w\u03b4 are as follows:\na) w\u03b4 is radial and nonnegative.\nb) w\u03b4 \u2208 C \u221e c (B(0, \u03b4)).\nc) There are constants a0 > 0 and 0 < b0 < 1 such that 0 \u2264 w\u03b4 \u2264 a0, and w\u03b4|B(0,b0\u03b4) = a0.\nd) w\u03b4(x1) \u2265 w\u03b4(x2) if |x1| \u2264 |x2|.\nNote that \u03c1\u03b4 \u2208 L 1(Rn).\nThe definitions of the nonlocal gradient and divergence for smooth functions are the following.\nDefinition 2.1. Set\ncn,s := n\u2212 1 + s\n\u03b3(1\u2212 s) .\na) Let u \u2208 C\u221ec (R n). The nonlocal gradient Ds\u03b4u is defined as\nDs\u03b4u(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\nu(x)\u2212 u(y)\n|x\u2212 y|\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y|\nw\u03b4(x\u2212 y)\n|x\u2212 y|n\u22121+s dy, x \u2208 Rn.\nb) Let u \u2208 C1c (R n,Rn). The nonlocal divergence is defined as\ndivs\u03b4 u(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\nu(x)\u2212 u(y) |x\u2212 y| \u00b7 x\u2212 y |x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y) |x\u2212 y|n\u22121+s dy, x \u2208 Rn,\nand the nonlocal gradient is defined as\nDs\u03b4u(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\nu(x)\u2212 u(y)\n|x\u2212 y| \u2297\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y|\nw\u03b4(x\u2212 y)\n|x\u2212 y|n\u22121+s dy, x \u2208 Rn.\nNotice that the three integrals in Definition 2.1 are absolutely convergent because u is Lipschitz and \u03c1\u03b4 \u2208 L\n1(Rn). It is also immediate from the definition that suppDs\u03b4u \u2282 supp u+ B(0, \u03b4), where supp denotes the support of a function.\nThe operators of Definition 2.1 are dual operators in the sense of integration by parts. Several versions of integration by parts formulas for related fractional or nonlocal operators have appeared in the literature [18, 27, 13, 31]. The integration by parts formula of interest in this investigation is the following [11, Th. 3.2].\nTheorem 2.1. Suppose that u \u2208 C\u221ec (R n) and \u03c6 \u2208 C1c (\u2126,R n). Then Ds\u03b4u \u2208 L \u221e(Rn,Rn) and divs\u03b4 \u03c6 \u2208 L \u221e(Rn). Moreover,\n\u222b\n\u2126\nDs\u03b4u(x) \u00b7 \u03c6(x) dx =\u2212\n\u222b\n\u2126\nu(x) divs\u03b4 \u03c6(x) dx\n\u2212 (n\u2212 1 + s)\n\u222b\n\u2126\n\u222b\n\u2126B,\u03b4\nu(y)\u03c6(x) |x\u2212 y| \u00b7 x\u2212 y |x\u2212 y| \u03c1\u03b4(x\u2212 y) dy dx\nand these three integrals are absolutely convergent.\nWe now extend Definition 2.1 a) to a broader class of functions.\nDefinition 2.2. a) Let u \u2208 L1(\u2126\u03b4) be such that there exists a sequence of {uj}j\u2208N \u2282 C \u221e c (R n) converging to u in L1(\u2126\u03b4) and for which {D s \u03b4uj}j\u2208N converges to some U in L\n1(\u2126,Rn). We define Ds\u03b4u as U .\nb) Let \u03c6 \u2208 L1(\u2126\u03b4,R n) be such that there exists a sequence of {\u03c6j}j\u2208N \u2282 C \u221e c (R n,Rn) converging to \u03c6 in L1(\u2126\u03b4,R n) and for which {divs\u03b4 \u03c6j}j\u2208N converges to some \u03a6 in L 1(\u2126). We\ndefine divs\u03b4 \u03c6 as \u03a6.\nIt was shown in [11, Lemma 3.3] that the above definitions of Ds\u03b4u and div s \u03b4 \u03c6 are independent of the sequence chosen. Similarly to the definition of Bessel spaces Hs,p(Rn) [9, 13], we define the space object of our study.\nDefinition 2.3. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. We define the space Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) as the closure of C\u221ec (R n) under the norm\n\u2016u\u2016Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) = ( \u2016u\u2016pLp(\u2126\u03b4) + \u2016D s \u03b4u\u2016 p Lp(\u2126)\n) 1 p\n.\nThus, functions in Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) are defined a.e. in \u2126\u03b4, while its gradient (Definition 2.2) is defined a.e. in \u2126. Definition 2.3 was introduced in [11]. There is an alternative definition of these spaces, based on a distributional notion of Ds\u03b4u; accordingly, H\ns,p,\u03b4(\u2126) is also the set of functions u \u2208 Lp(\u2126\u03b4) whose distributional D s \u03b4u is in L\np(\u2126); see [16], where one can find the equivalence with the current one. The situation is, thus, similar to what happens with the Bessel potential spaces Hs,p(Rn): they can be defined as the closure of smooth functions [29] and as the set of functions u \u2208 Lp(Rn) whose distributional gradient Dsu is in Lp(Rn) [13].\nThe case p = \u221e is avoided in Definition 2.3. Nevertheless, one can give the following definition based on a type of closure: u \u2208 Hs,\u221e,\u03b4(\u2126) when there exists a sequence {uj}j\u2208N in C\u221ec (R n) such that uj \u2192 u uniformly in \u2126\u03b4, D s \u03b4uj \u2192 D s \u03b4u a.e. in \u2126 and \u2016D s \u03b4uj\u2016L\u221e(\u2126) \u2192 \u2016Ds\u03b4u\u2016L\u221e(\u2126). This definition is inspired by the density properties of Sobolev functions in the case p = \u221e; see, e.g., [26, Exercise 10.21]. It is not difficult to show that all theorems stated here for p < \u221e can be proved with slight adaptations to the case p = \u221e.\nThe space Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) satisfies reflexivity and separability properties. See [11, Prop 3.4].\nProposition 2.2. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Then Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) is a separable Banach space. If, in addition, p > 1, it is reflexive.\nThe following continuous inclusion holds immediately.\nProposition 2.3. The continuous inclusion Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) \u2282 Hs,q,\u03b4(\u2126) holds whenever 1 \u2264 q \u2264 p < \u221e.\nIn order to describe the boundary condition, we recall the set \u2126\u2212\u03b4 = {x \u2208 \u2126 : dist(x, \u2202\u2126) > \u03b4} and define the subspace Hs,p,\u03b40 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4) as the closure of C \u221e c (\u2126\u2212\u03b4) in H\ns,p,\u03b4(\u2126). It is immediate to check that any u \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b40 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4) satisfies u = 0 a.e. in \u2126\u03b4 \\ \u2126\u2212\u03b4. Finally, given g \u2208 H\ns,p,\u03b4(\u2126) we define the affine subspace Hs,p,\u03b4g (\u2126\u2212\u03b4) as g +H s,p,\u03b4 0 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4).\nAn essential tool for obtaining existence of minimizers for integral functionals is a Poincar\u00e9type inequality. Given p > 1 and 0 < s < 1 with sp < n we define p\u2217s := np n\u2212sp .\nTheorem 2.4. Let 1 < p < \u221e. Then there exists C = C(|\u2126|, n, p, s) > 0 such that\n\u2016u\u2016Lq(\u2126) \u2264 C\u2016D s \u03b4u\u2016Lp(\u2126)\nfor all u \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b40 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4), and any q satisfying\n\n \n \nq \u2208 [1, p\u2217s] if sp < n, q \u2208 [1,\u221e) if sp = n,\nq \u2208 [1,\u221e] if sp > n.\nProof. The case sp < n corresponds to [11, Th. 6.1]. The case sp = n is a consequence of [11, Th. 6.4] (or else of the previous case and Proposition 2.3). The case sp > n is a particular case of [11, Th. 6.3].\nThe following result decides which of the embeddings of Theorem 2.4 are compact. We will indicate by \u21c0 weak convergence.\nTheorem 2.5. Let 1 < p < \u221e and g \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126). Then for any sequence {uj}j\u2208N \u2282 H s,p,\u03b4 g (\u2126\u2212\u03b4) such that uj \u21c0 u in H s,p,\u03b4(\u2126),\nfor some u \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126), one has u \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4g (\u2126) and\nuj \u2192 u in L q(\u2126),\nfor every q satisfying \n \n \nq \u2208 [1, p\u2217s) if sp < n, q \u2208 [1,\u221e) if sp = n,\nq \u2208 [1,\u221e] if sp > n.\nThe case p = 1 is not covered by Theorem 2.4, since the result [11, Th. 6.1] was not able to deal with that case. On the contrary, there is a version of Theorem 2.5 for p = 1 in [11, Th. 7.3], but, for simplicity, we have not mentioned it since it will not be used, as the existence theory of Section 6 deals with the reflexive case."

We start with the embeddings from Sobolev spaces W 1,p to Hs,p,\u03b4, as well as an inequality between the norms of the classical and the nonlocal gradient.

At the end of this article we will comment on functions in the latter functional spaces that are not in the corresponding Sobolev ones.\nLemma 3.1. Assume that \u2126\u03b4 has a Lipschitz boundary.

We start with a). We first assume u \u2208 C\u221ec (R n).

Combining (6) and (7) we obtain inequality (4).\nNow we show the inequality for any u \u2208 W 1,p(\u2126\u03b4) through an extension and density argument. Let u\u0303 \u2208 W 1,p(Rn) be an extension of u, and let {uj}j\u2208N be a sequence in C \u221e c (R\nn) converging to u\u0303 in W 1,p(Rn). Then {uj}j\u2208N also converges to u in H\ns,p,\u03b4(\u2126); indeed, this can be shown by the string of embeddings\nW 1,p(Rn) \u2282 Hs,p(Rn) \u2282 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126);\nsee [1, Ch. 1] or [10, Prop. 2.7] for the first inclusion, and [11, Prop. 3.5] for the second.

Let u \u2208 W 1,\u221e(\u2126\u03b4). Then u \u2208 W 1,p(\u2126\u03b4) for all p \u2208 [1,\u221e),\nso u \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) and\n\u2016Ds\u03b4u\u2016Lp(\u2126) \u2264 (n\u2212 1 + s) \u2016\u03c1\u03b4\u2016L1(Rn) \u2016Du\u2016Lp(\u2126\u03b4) \u2264 (n\u2212 1 + s) \u2016\u03c1\u03b4\u2016L1(Rn) |\u2126| 1 p\u2016Du\u2016L\u221e(\u2126\u03b4).\nLetting p \u2192 \u221e we obtain inequality (5), so b) is proved.\nNote that one cannot replace \u2016Du\u2016Lp(\u2126\u03b4) with \u2016Du\u2016Lp(\u2126) in inequality (4), since, if \u2016Du\u2016Lp(\u2126) = 0 then u is constant in \u2126, hence Ds\u03b4u = 0 in \u2126\u2212\u03b4, but D s \u03b4u is not necessarily zero in \u2126 \\ \u2126\u2212\u03b4.\nNow we introduce a nonlocal operator similar to the nonlocal gradient and divergence that plays an essential part in the derivative of a product. The fractional analogue of this operator was studied in [9]. In truth, the same symbol Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 denotes four slightly different operators, but the notation chosen avoids any risk of confusion. Henceforth, [\u03d5]C0,1(\u2126\u03b4) denotes the Lipschitz seminorm of \u03d5 in \u2126\u03b4.\nDefinition 3.1. Let \u03d5 \u2208 C0,1(\u2126\u03b4).\na) For U \u2208 L1(\u2126\u03b4) or U \u2208 L 1(\u2126\u03b4,R n\u00d7n) we define\nKs,\u03b4\u03d5 (U)(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\n\u03d5(x)\u2212 \u03d5(y)\n|x\u2212 y|n+s U(y)\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y) dy, a.e. x \u2208 \u2126.\nb) For U \u2208 L1(\u2126\u03b4,R n) we define\nKs,\u03b4\u03d5 (U)(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\n\u03d5(x)\u2212 \u03d5(y)\n|x\u2212 y|n+s U(y) \u00b7\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y) dy, a.e. x \u2208 \u2126\nand\nKs,\u03b4\u03d5 (U T )(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\n\u03d5(x)\u2212 \u03d5(y)\n|x\u2212 y|n+s U(y)\u2297\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y) dy, a.e. x \u2208 \u2126.\nThe next result is the analogue of [9, Lemma 3.2] in a bounded domain framework.\nLemma 3.2.

Then:\na) The operators\nKs,\u03b4\u03d5 : L p(\u2126\u03b4) \u2192 L p(\u2126,Rn), Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 : L p(\u2126\u03b4,R n\u00d7n) \u2192 Lp(\u2126,Rn)\nand\nKs,\u03b4\u03d5 : L p(\u2126\u03b4,R n) \u2192 Lp(\u2126), Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 : L p(\u2126\u03b4,R n) \u2192 Lp(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n)\nU 7\u2192 Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 (U), U 7\u2192 K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (U T )\nare linear and bounded, and in all cases we have the estimate\n\u2016Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 (U)\u2016Lp(\u2126) \u2264 (n+ s\u2212 1)[\u03d5]0,1 \u2016\u03c1\u03b4\u2016L1(Rn) \u2016U\u2016Lp(\u2126\u03b4)\nand analogously for \u2016Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 (U T )\u2016Lp(\u2126).\nb) trKs,\u03b4\u03d5 (U T ) = Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 (U) for every U \u2208 L 1(\u2126\u03b4,R n).\nProof. For a) we will do the case for the operator Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 : L p(\u2126\u03b4) \u2192 L p(\u2126,Rn), as the same proof is valid for all four operators, which are clearly linear. So let U \u2208 Lp(\u2126\u03b4). The steps are similar to the proof of Lemma 3.1. Assume first p < \u221e.

The proof for p = \u221e is even simpler: for U \u2208 L\u221e(\u2126\u03b4) and a.e. x \u2208 \u2126,\n\u2223 \u2223Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 (U)(x) \u2223 \u2223 \u2264 |cn,s|[\u03d5]0,1 \u2016U\u2016L\u221e(\u2126\u03b4)\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\nw\u03b4(x\u2212 y)\n|x\u2212 y|n+s\u22121 dy = (n+s\u22121)[\u03d5]0,1 \u2016U\u2016L\u221e(\u2126\u03b4) \u2016\u03c1\u03b4\u2016L1(Rn) .\nTherefore, \u2225\n\u2225Ks,\u03b4\u03d5 (U) \u2225 \u2225 L\u221e(\u2126) \u2264 (n + s\u2212 1)[\u03d5]0,1 \u2016\u03c1\u03b4\u2016L1(Rn) \u2016U\u2016L\u221e(\u2126\u03b4) ,\nwhich concludes the proof of a). As a consequence of the previous argument, the integrals of Definition 3.1 are absolutely convergent for a.e. x \u2208 \u2126. For such x and U \u2208 L1(\u2126\u03b4,R n) we have\ntrKs,\u03b4\u03d5 (U T )(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\ntr\n(\n\u03d5(x)\u2212 \u03d5(y)\n|x\u2212 y|n+s U(y)\u2297\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y)\n)\ndy\n= cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\n\u03d5(x)\u2212 \u03d5(y)\n|x\u2212 y|n+s U(y) \u00b7\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y) dy = K\ns,\u03b4 \u03d5 (U)(x),\nwhich proves b).\nNow we introduce a product formula for the nonlocal gradient.\nLemma 3.3. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and \u03d5 \u2208 C\u221e(\u2126\u0304\u03b4).\na) If g \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) then \u03d5g \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) and\nDs\u03b4(\u03d5g) = \u03d5D s \u03b4g +K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (g).\nb) If g \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn) then \u03d5g \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn) and\nDs\u03b4(\u03d5g) = \u03d5D s \u03b4g +K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (g T ).\nProof. We show a); the proof of b) follows from an application of a) componentwise. The function \u03d5 has a C\u221ec (R n) extension, so we can suppose \u03d5 \u2208 C\u221ec (R n). First we assume g \u2208 C\u221ec (R n). For all x \u2208 Rn we have\nDs\u03b4(\u03d5g)(x) = cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\n\u03d5(x)g(x)\u2212 \u03d5(x)g(y) + \u03d5(x)g(y)\u2212 \u03d5(y)g(y) |x\u2212 y|n+s x\u2212 y |x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y) dy\n= \u03d5(x)Ds\u03b4g(x) +K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (g)(x).\n(8)\nNow we consider g \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) and a sequence {gj}j\u2208N \u2282 C \u221e c (R n) converging to g in Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126). Then {\u03d5gj}j\u2208N is a sequence in C \u221e c (R\nn) that clearly converges to \u03d5g in Lp(\u2126\u03b4). Let us check that {Ds\u03b4(\u03d5gj)}j\u2208N converges in L p(\u2126,Rn). Owing to (8) we have\nDs\u03b4(\u03d5gj) = \u03d5D s \u03b4gj +K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (gj), j \u2208 N.\nSince Ds\u03b4gj \u2192 D s \u03b4g in L p(\u2126,Rn) as j \u2192 \u221e, we also have that \u03d5Ds\u03b4gj \u2192 \u03d5D s \u03b4g in L p(\u2126,Rn). By Lemma 3.2, as gj \u2192 g in L p(\u2126\u03b4) as j \u2192 \u221e, we obtain that K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (gj) \u2192 K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (g) in L\np(\u2126,Rn). This shows the conclusion of a).\nFor \u03c6 \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn) there is a natural relation between Ds\u03b4\u03c6 and div s \u03b4 \u03c6. We also state the product formula for the divergence. As usual, the divergence of a matrix is the vector whose components are the divergence of the rows.\nLemma 3.4. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Let \u03c6 \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn). Then divs\u03b4 \u03c6 \u2208 L p(\u2126) and trDs\u03b4\u03c6 = div s \u03b4 \u03c6 a.e. in \u2126. Moreover, for any \u03d5 \u2208 C\u221e(\u2126\u0304\u03b4),\ndivs\u03b4(\u03d5\u03c6) = \u03d5 div s \u03b4 \u03c6+K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (\u03c6),\nand for any \u03a6 \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n),\ndivs\u03b4(\u03d5\u03a6) = \u03d5 div s \u03b4 \u03a6 +K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (\u03a6).\nProof. By extension, we can assume \u03d5 \u2208 C\u221ec (R n). Let {\u03c6j}j\u2208N \u2282 C \u221e c (R n,Rn) be a sequence converging to \u03c6 in Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn). Having in mind that the integrals of Definition 2.1 are absolutely convergent, we obtain, for each x \u2208 \u2126 and j \u2208 N,\ntrDs\u03b4\u03c6j(x) = cn,s tr\n( \u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\n\u03c6j(x)\u2212 \u03c6j(y)\n|x\u2212 y|n+s \u2297\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y)dy\n)\n= cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\ntr\n(\n\u03c6j(x)\u2212 \u03c6j(y)\n|x\u2212 y|n+s \u2297\nx\u2212 y\n|x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y)\n)\ndy\n= cn,s\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\n\u03c6j(x)\u2212 \u03c6j(y) |x\u2212 y|n+s \u00b7 x\u2212 y |x\u2212 y| w\u03b4(x\u2212 y)dy = div s \u03b4 \u03c6j(x).\nSince Ds\u03b4\u03c6j \u2192 D s \u03b4\u03c6 in L p(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n), we obtain, succesively, that trDs\u03b4\u03c6j \u2192 trD s \u03b4\u03c6 in L p(\u2126), divs\u03b4 \u03c6 \u2208 L p(\u2126) and trDs\u03b4\u03c6 = div s \u03b4 \u03c6 in L\np(\u2126). Now we prove the product formula. By the result above and applying Lemmas 3.3 b) and\n3.2 b), we obtain\ndivs\u03b4(\u03d5\u03c6) = trD s \u03b4(\u03d5\u03c6) = tr\n(\n\u03d5Ds\u03b4\u03c6+K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (\u03c6 T ) ) = \u03d5 divs\u03b4 \u03c6+K s,\u03b4 \u03d5 (\u03c6).\nThe formula for \u03a6 is immediate by applying componentwise the above formula."

            "text": "In this section we show that nonlocal gradients are in fact gradients of another function. This idea was exploited in [25] in the fractional context, whose fully analogue result in this nonlocal case (nonlocal gradients are gradients, and vice versa) is shown in [16]; here we also see one implication: nonlocal gradients are gradients (Lemma 4.2).\nWe first recall from [11, Lemma 4.2] that Qs\u03b4 is a radial L 1(Rn) function with support in\nB(0, \u03b4) such that\n\u2207Qs\u03b4(x) = \u2212(n\u2212 1 + s) \u03c1\u03b4(x)\n|x|\nx\n|x| , x \u2208 Rn \\ {0}.\nWe will do convolutions with Qs\u03b4 with functions defined in \u2126\u03b4. Thus, with a small abuse of notation, given u : \u2126\u03b4 \u2192 R we will write Q s \u03b4 \u2217 u as the function defined in \u2126 by\nQs\u03b4 \u2217 u(x) =\n\u222b\nB(x,\u03b4)\nQs\u03b4(x\u2212 y)u(y) dy,\nwhenever the integral is well defined. In truth, Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u is the restriction to \u2126 of the convolution Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u\u0304, where u\u0304 : R\nn \u2192 R is the extension by zero of u. We show the boundedness of this operator.\nLemma 4.1. For any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, the map u 7\u2192 Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u is linear and bounded from L p(\u2126\u03b4) to Lp(\u2126).\nProof. Given any u \u2208 Lp(\u2126\u03b4), we denote by u\u0304 its extension to R n by zero and use Young\u2019s inequality, so as to obtain that\n\u2016Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u\u2016Lp(\u2126) = \u2016Q s \u03b4 \u2217 u\u0304\u2016Lp(\u2126) \u2264 \u2016Q s \u03b4 \u2217 u\u0304\u2016Lp(Rn) \u2264 \u2016Q s \u03b4\u2016L1(Rn) \u2016u\u0304\u2016Lp(Rn) = \u2016Q s \u03b4\u2016L1(Rn) \u2016u\u2016Lp(\u2126\u03b4) .\nThe first part (the smooth case) of the following lemma was essentially proved in [11]. We provide the necessary details to arrive at the precise formulation we need, as well as to prove the Hs,p,\u03b4 version. As mentioned before, the result is akin to that simultaneously proved in [16, Prop. 2.15].\nLemma 4.2. a) For all u \u2208 C\u221ec (R n) we have that Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u \u2208 C \u221e c (R n) and\nDs\u03b4u = D(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 u) = Q s \u03b4 \u2217Du.\nMoreover, for all \u03c6 \u2208 C\u221ec (R n,Rn) we have that\ndivs\u03b4 \u03c6 = div(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 \u03c6) = Q s \u03b4 \u2217 div \u03c6.\nb) Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Then the map u 7\u2192 Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u is linear and bounded from H s,p,\u03b4(\u2126) to\nW 1,p(\u2126). Moreover, for all u \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126),\nDs\u03b4u = D(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 u) in \u2126,\nand for all \u03c6 \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn),\ndivs\u03b4 \u03c6 = div(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 \u03c6) in \u2126.\nProof. We start with a). We have from [11, Prop. 4.3] that Ds\u03b4u = Q s \u03b4 \u2217 Du. In fact, owing to a classic result in convolution (see, e.g., [12, Props. 4.18 and 4.20]), Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u \u2208 C \u221e c (R\nn) and D(Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u) = Q s \u03b4 \u2217Du.\nWe now apply the equality Qs\u03b4 \u2217D\u03c6 = D s \u03b4\u03c6 as well as Lemma 3.4 to conclude that\nQs\u03b4 \u2217 div \u03c6 = Q s \u03b4 \u2217 (trD\u03c6) = tr(Q s \u03b4 \u2217D\u03c6) = trD s \u03b4\u03c6 = div s \u03b4 \u03c6\nand, additionally, tr(Qs\u03b4 \u2217D\u03c6) = trD(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 \u03c6) = div(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 \u03c6).\nNow we show b). Let {uj}j\u2208N be a sequence in C \u221e c (R n) converging to u in Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126). Since uj \u2192 u in L p(\u2126\u03b4), by Lemma 4.1, Q s \u03b4 \u2217 uj \u2192 Q s \u03b4 \u2217 u in L p(\u2126). On the other hand, Ds\u03b4uj \u2192 D s \u03b4u in Lp(\u2126,Rn) and, by a), Ds\u03b4uj = D(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 uj) for each j \u2208 N. By the locality and closedness of the derivative operator, Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u \u2208 W 1,p(\u2126) and D(Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u) = D s \u03b4u. The same proof also shows the boundedness of the operator u 7\u2192 Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u from H s,p,\u03b4(\u2126) to W 1,p(\u2126). Moreover, by Lemma 3.4, divs\u03b4 \u03c6 = trD s \u03b4\u03c6 = trD(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 \u03c6) = div(Q s \u03b4 \u2217 \u03c6)."

As in the previous results, Lemma 4.2 reduces the analysis to the Sobolev case, and for this we use the sharpest result of the continuity of the determinant in this context, which is due to [28] and [22].\nTheorem 5.3. Let p \u2265 n \u2212 1 and q \u2265 n n\u22121 . Let {uj}j\u2208N be a sequence in H s,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn) such that uj \u21c0 u in H s,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn). Then:\na) If k \u2208 N with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 2 and \u00b5 is a minor of order k then \u00b5(Ds\u03b4uj) \u21c0 \u00b5(D s \u03b4u) in\nL p k (\u2126) as j \u2192 \u221e.\nb) If cofDs\u03b4uj \u21c0 \u03d1 in L 1(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n) for some \u03d1 \u2208 Lq(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n) then \u03d1 = cofDs\u03b4u.\nc) If cofDs\u03b4uj \u2208 L q(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n) for each j \u2208 N, cofDs\u03b4uj \u21c0 cofD s \u03b4u in L 1(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n) and detDs\u03b4uj \u21c0 \u03b8 in L 1(\u2126) for some \u03b8 \u2208 L1(\u2126) then \u03b8 = detDs\u03b4u.\nProof. Define vj = Q s \u03b4 \u2217 uj and v = Q s \u03b4 \u2217 u. By Lemma 4.2, we have vj \u21c0 v in W 1,p(\u2126,Rn), as well as Dvj = D s \u03b4uj and Dv = D s \u03b4u. Thus, we can apply a classical result on the convergence of minors (see, e.g., [3, Th. 6.2] or [17, Th. 8.20]) to conclude that cofDvj \u21c0 cofDv in the sense of distributions and \u00b5(Dvj) \u21c0 \u00b5(Dv) in L p\nk (\u2126) for every minor \u00b5 of order k \u2208 {1, . . . , n\u22122}. This proves a). Under assumption b), we have cofDvj \u21c0 \u03d1 in L\n1(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n) so \u03d1 = cofDv = cofDs\u03b4u, which proves b).\nSuppose assumption c). As cofDvj \u2208 L q(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n) for each j \u2208 N, we conclude that the divergence identities of [28, Th. 3.2] hold for vj . This, in turn, is equivalent to the fact that the surface energy E\u0304 of vj defined in [22, Def. 1] is zero (see [22, Prop. 3]). As observed in [7, Sect. 2.5], the surface energy E of vj defined in [22, Def. 2] is also zero. Thus, we can apply [22, Th. 3] and conclude that \u03b8 = detDv = detDs\u03b4u."

            "text": "In this section we prove the existence of minimizers in Hs,p,\u03b4 of functionals of the form\nI(u) :=\n\u222b\n\u2126\nW (x, u(x), Ds\u03b4u(x)) dx. (9)\nunder natural coercivity and polyconvexity assumptions. We also derive the associated Euler\u2013 Lagrange equation, which is a partial nonlocal-differential system of equations.\nWe recall the concept of polyconvexity (see, e.g, [3, 17]). Let \u03c4 be the number of submatrices of an n \u00d7 n matrix. We fix a function \u00b5 : Rn\u00d7n \u2192 R\u03c4 such that \u00b5(F ) is the collection of all minors of an F \u2208 Rn\u00d7n in a given order. A function W0 : R\nn\u00d7n \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e} is polyconvex if there exists a convex \u03a6 : R\u03c4 \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e} such that W0(F ) = \u03a6(\u00b5(F )) for all F \u2208 R\nn\u00d7n. The existence theorem is as follows. Its proof relies on a standard argument in the Calculus of variations, once we have the continuity (with respect to the weak convergence) of the minors given by Theorem 5.3.\nTheorem 6.1. Let p \u2265 n\u2212 1 satisfy p > 1. Let q \u2265 n n\u22121 . Let W : Rn \u00d7Rn\u00d7Rn\u00d7n \u2192 R\u222a{\u221e} satisfy the following conditions:\na) W is Ln \u00d7 Bn \u00d7 Bn\u00d7n-measurable, where Ln denotes the Lebesgue sigma-algebra in Rn, whereas Bn and Bn\u00d7n denote the Borel sigma-algebras in Rn and Rn\u00d7n, respectively.\nb) W (x, \u00b7, \u00b7) is lower semicontinuous for a.e. x \u2208 Rn.\nc) For a.e. x \u2208 Rn and every y \u2208 Rn, the function W (x, y, \u00b7) is polyconvex.\nd) There exist a constant c > 0, an a \u2208 L1(\u2126) and a Borel function h : [0,\u221e) \u2192 [0,\u221e) such that\nlim t\u2192\u221e\nh(t)\nt = \u221e\nand W (x, y, F ) \u2265 a(x) + c |F |p + c |cof F |q + h(|detF |)\nfor a.e. x \u2208 \u2126, all y \u2208 Rn and all F \u2208 Rn\u00d7n.\nLet u0 \u2208 H s,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn). Define I as in (9), and assume that I is not identically infinity in Hs,p,\u03b4u0 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4,R n). Then there exists a minimizer of I in Hs,p,\u03b4u0 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4,R n). Proof. Assumption d) shows that the functional I is bounded below by \u222b\n\u2126 a. As I is not identi-\ncally infinity in Hs,p,\u03b4u0 (\u2126,R n), there exists a minimizing sequence {uj}j\u2208N of I in H s,p,\u03b4 u0 (\u2126,Rn). Assumption d) implies that {Ds\u03b4uj}j\u2208N is bounded in L\np(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n). Applying Theorem 2.4 to uj\u2212u0, we obtain that {uj}j\u2208N is bounded in L\np(\u2126,Rn) and, consequently, also in Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn). Using that Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn) is reflexive (Proposition 2.2) and Theorem 2.5, there exists u \u2208 Hs,p,\u03b4u0 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4,R n) such that for a subsequence (not relabelled),\nuj \u21c0 u in H s,p,\u03b4(\u2126,Rn) and uj \u2192 u in L p(\u2126,Rn).\nBy Theorem 5.3, for any minor \u00b5 of order k \u2264 n\u2212 2, we have that\n\u00b5(Ds\u03b4uj) \u21c0 \u00b5(D s \u03b4u) in L\np k (\u2126).\nMoreover, assumption d) shows that {cofDs\u03b4uj}j\u2208N is bounded in L q(\u2126,Rn\u00d7n), and, as q > 1, we can extract a weakly convergent subsequence, which by Theorem 5.3 tends to cofDs\u03b4u. Again by\nd), together with de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin\u2019s criterion, we have that {detDs\u03b4uj}j\u2208N is equiintegrable, so, for a subsequence, it converges weakly in L1(\u2126) to a function that, by Theorem 5.3 has to be detDs\u03b4u.\nThe above convergences imply, thanks to a standard lower semicontinuity result for polyconvex functionals (see, e.g., [6, Th. 5.4] or [20, Th. 7.5]), that\nI(u) \u2264 lim inf j\u2192\u221e I(uj).\nTherefore, u is a minimizer of I in Hs,p,\u03b4u0 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4,R n).\nIt is well known that Sobolev functions cannot have discontinuities along (n\u22121)-dimensional surfaces (see, e.g., [19, Thms. 4.7.4, 4.8.1 and 5.6.3]). On the other hand, depending on the exponent of integrability of Du and cofDu, a Sobolev function u can or cannot have discontinuities of cavitation type. In fact, under the assumptions of [28], the deformation cannot exhibit cavitation. But, as a consequence of the analysis of [9, Sect. 2.1] and [11, Prop. 3.5] (see also [14, Prop. 1.8]), functions in Hs,p,\u03b4(\u2126) can exhibit fracture in the range of exponents sp < 1, and cavitation in the range of exponents sp < n. Both ranges are compatible with the assumptions of Theorem 6.1.\nThis is in contrast with the Sobolev or SBV (special bounded variation) case. Indeed, the classical space for fracture is SBV and the energy to minimize requires a contribution of the surface energy (see, e.g., [2]). On the other hand, it was shown in [23, 24] that the divergence identities of [28] correspond to the absence of cavitation, while these divergence identities were essential to prove Theorem 5.3. The explanation of this apparent paradox is that the key of the proof of Theorem 5.3 is that Qs\u03b4 \u2217u does not exhibit cavitation or fracture, regardless of whether u does. In fact, in many proofs of this article we invoke known results to the regularized version Qs\u03b4 \u2217 u of u.\nTo sum up, Theorem 6.1, which determines the existence of minimizers of a nonlocal hyperelastic energy, is compatible with functions exhibiting fracture or cavitation, in opposition to the case of classical elasticity (see, e.g., [3, 34, 28, 4, 5, 7]). Thanks to the sharpness of exponents p, q of Theorem 6.1, the range of exponents p, q, s for which fracture or cavitation are compatible with the existence of minimizers is wider than that of the fractional case [9].\nTo finish the article, we show the equilibrium (Euler\u2013Lagrange) equations that minimizers of functional (9) satisfy. The notation for partial derivatives is as follows: DyW (x, \u00b7, F ) is the derivative of W (x, \u00b7, F ), and DFW (x, y, \u00b7) is the derivative of W (x, y, \u00b7).\nTheorem 6.2. Let 1 < p < \u221e. Let u0 \u2208 H s,p,\u03b4(\u2126). Let W : \u2126 \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 Rn\u00d7n \u2192 R satisfy the following conditions:\na) W (\u00b7, y, F ) is Ln-measurable for each y \u2208 Rn and F \u2208 Rn\u00d7n.\nb) W (x, \u00b7, \u00b7) is of class C1 for a.e. x \u2208 \u2126.\nc) There exist c > 0 and a \u2208 L1(\u2126) such that some of the following inequalities holds for a.e. x \u2208 \u2126, all y \u2208 Rn and all F \u2208 Rn\u00d7n:\nc0) |W (x, y, F )|+ |DyW (x, y, F )|+ |DFW (x, y, F )| \u2264 a(x) + c (|y| p + |F |p) ,\nc1) sp < n, u0 \u2208 L r(\u2126\u03b4,R n) with 1 \u2264 r \u2264 p\u2217s and\n|W (x, y, F )|+ |DyW (x, y, F )|+ |DFW (x, y, F )| \u2264 a(x) + c (|y| r + |F |p) .\nc2) sp = n, \u222b\n\u2126\u03b4\nexp (|u0(x)| r) dx < \u221e\nfor some 1 \u2264 r < p\u2032 and\n|W (x, y, F )|+ |DyW (x, y, F )|+ |DFW (x, y, F )| \u2264 a(x) + exp(|y| r) + c |F |p .\nc3) sp > n, u0 \u2208 L \u221e(\u2126\u03b4,R n) and there exists a function f : [0,\u221e) \u2192 [0,\u221e) sending bounded sets in bounded sets such that\n|W (x, y, F )|+ |DyW (x, y, F )|+ |DFW (x, y, F )| \u2264 a(x) + f(|y|) + c |F | p .\nDefine I as in (9). Let u be a minimizer of I in Hs,p,\u03b4u0 (\u2126\u2212\u03b4). Then, for every \u03d5 \u2208 C \u221e c (\u2126\u2212\u03b4),\n\u222b\n\u2126\n[DyW (x, u(x), D s \u03b4u(x))\u03d5(x) +DFW (x, u(x), D s \u03b4u(x)) \u00b7D s \u03b4\u03d5(x)] dx = 0.\nIf, in addition, DzW (\u00b7, u(\u00b7), D s \u03b4u(\u00b7)) \u2208 C 1(\u2126\u2212\u03b4,R n) then\nDyW (x, u(x), D s \u03b4u(x)) = div s \u03b4 DFW (x, u(x), D s \u03b4u(x))\nfor a.e. x \u2208 \u2126\u2212\u03b4.\nProof. The proof for the scalar case and under assumption c0) was shown in [11, Th. 8.2]. The proof for the vectorial case requires no essential modification, so we just mention the small adaptations for cases c1)\u2013c3).\nThanks to Theorem 2.4, u \u2208 Lr(\u2126\u03b4,R n) under assumption c1),\n\u222b\n\u2126\u03b4\nexp (|u(x)|r) dx < \u221e\nunder assumption c2), and u \u2208 L\u221e(\u2126\u03b4,R n) under assumption c3). Actually, case c2) requires the Trudinger inequality of [11, Th. 6.4]. The corresponding bounds of c1)\u2013c3) allow us to apply dominated convergence to differentiate under the integral sign. This concludes the proof."
