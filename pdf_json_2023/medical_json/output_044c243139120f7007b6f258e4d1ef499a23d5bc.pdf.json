    "abstractText": "Background: Geriatric patients (\u226580 years) are underrepresented in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) clinical trials. However, their unique biology may affect their response to ICIs. There are currently no established biomarkers of the response to ICIs in adult patients with cancer that can help with patient selection. Methods: We built a multicenter, international retrospective study of 885 patients (<80 years: n = 417, 47.12%; \u226580 years: n = 468, 52.88%) with different tumor types treated with ICIs between 2011 and 2021 from 11 academic centers in the U.S. and Europe. The main outcome measures were objective response rates (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) stratified by age and circulating inflammatory levels (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII)). Results: Patients \u226580 years with low NLR (NLR-L) and SII (SII-L) had significantly higher ORR (vs. high NLR [NLR-H], p < 0.01 and SII-H, p < 0.05, respectively). At median follow-ups (13.03 months), and compared to SII-H, patients with SII-L had significantly longer median PFS and OS in patients <80 (p < 0.001), and \u226580 years (p < 0.001). SII-L was independently associated with longer PFS and OS (HR: 0.61 and 0.62, respectively, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Lower inflammation pre-ICI initiation may predict an improved response and survival in geriatric patients with cancer.",

            "text": "Cancer is often a disease of aging, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment [1]. The participation of older patients in ICI trials has been suboptimal, particularly at the extremes of age [2]. A recent evaluation of a large, multicenter cohort of patients over the age of 80 years with cancer suggests that ICIs have a favorable efficacy and toxicity profile in older adults [3]. However, up to twothirds of patients treated with ICIs demonstrate resistance to these drugs, limiting their benefit while still exposing patients to risks of morbid or even life-threatening adverse events [4\u20136]. Tumor type is a major predictor of ICI efficacy, and some existing biomarkers, albeit imperfect, are currently used to select patients for ICI therapy (e.g., MSI-H, TMB or PD-L1 levels). The impact of tumor type and other markers, however, has been derived from major trials and studies where the participation of older patients has been minimal. None of the currently used markers have been exclusively studied in this population. This is particularly important in the setting of older and frailer patients with more comorbidity. There is thus an unmet need for biomarkers of response that can help with patient selection and monitoring responses to treatment in older patients with cancer. Immunosenescence, the age-related remodeling process of the immune system, is thought to influence the efficacy of ICIs [7]. It results in immune dysregulation via both cellular and humoral immunity, with depletion of lymphocyte reserves, fewer CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased variety of regulatory and memory T-cells and an overall increased pro-inflammatory state [8\u201310]. Chronic aging-related inflammation, \u201cinflammaging\u201d, is reflected in the higher serum levels of IL-6, CRP and TNF observed in adults \u226570 years old [11\u201313]. While common in older individuals, inflammaging is thought to be an evolutionary conserved mechanistic pillar of aging that is shared by age-related diseases, and\nis seen with some but not all individuals as we age [14]. Upon treatment with ICIs, a pro-inflammatory host state decreases the response to these therapies, as higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers in the tumor microenvironment (TME) [15,16] reduce tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes and confer worse survival [17\u201319]. We sought to explore the impact of pre-treatment levels of circulating inflammatory markers on response to ICIs in a cohort of patients 80 years (yr) of age or older (\u226580 yr) in comparison to those younger than 80 (<80 yr)."

For the <80 yr cohort, specifically, and to avoid selection bias, the first consecutive 417 patients treated during this time period were selected and included. ICI agents included anti-programmed cell death protein1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) therapies; chemotherapy/ICI combinations were excluded. Baseline characteristic data were collected, including age at treatment initiation, sex, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/ECOG), tumor histologies, stage at treatment initiation, prior lines of therapy, type of ICI therapy and time on therapy. Pre-treatment levels of circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets were collected to compute the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the systemic immuneinflammation index (SII) for each patient. NLR was defined as the absolute number of neutrophils divided by the absolute number of lymphocytes. SII is the product of platelet count and neutrophil count divided by lymphocyte count (SII = platelets \u00d7 neutrophils/lymphocytes) (Table S2). Optimal cut-off values for high (H) vs. low (L) levels were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves, as follows: NLR-L <3 (vs. \u22653 NLR-H) and SII-L (<600 vs. \u2265600 SII-H)."

            "text": "Determinants of response to ICIs in older cancer patients remain poorly understood, and aging-associated biomarkers of ICI response in this population have not been explored before. Immunosenescence and inflammaging are inter-related biologic processes that underlie aging and carcinogenesis. They are hypothesized to share a common endproduct, immune suppression [7,10,13], via the dysregulation of cellular and humoral immunity [9,10] and the modulation of the TME composition [16\u201319]. Here, low levels of NLR and SII were associated with significantly higher ORR in patients \u226580 yr but not in younger patients, suggesting that low levels of either of these markers can potentially serve as a biomarker of a response to ICI in patients \u226580 yr, exclusively. Our findings are supported by several studies across different tumor types treated with ICIs, whereby lower NLR and SII levels identified patients with a greater ORR to ICIs [20\u201325], and a decline in NLR levels post-ICI initiation, was associated with significantly improved ORR, PFS and OS [20,21]. However, none of these studies explored the potential use of these markers as discriminatory biomarkers for geriatric patients with cancer. To our best knowledge, this is the first study exploring inflammatory markers as potential age-associated predictors of response to ICIs. Of note, while lower NLR and SII were associated with better response rates in patients \u226580 yr, pre-treatment levels of these markers did not significantly differ by age. This can be explained by our selection of 80 yr as an age cut-off, whereby biological differences between younger patients at the upper range level (e.g., 79 years) and older ones at the lower range level (e.g., 80 years) may not be as pronounced, if existent. This could be addressed by comparing more distant age groups, such as \u226470 yr vs. \u226580 yr, for example. Nevertheless, the significant association between low NLR and SII levels and better ORR is likely a conservative estimation of this impact given the proximity of the two compared age groups as described earlier. The impact of low levels of circulating NLR and SII in patients \u226580 yr was also consistent for OS but did not consistently reflect on PFS with respect to age. This can\nbe explained by a smaller sample size of patients \u226580 yr with NLR-L, for whom PFS data were available (n = 45). However, in a population of older patients with more comorbidity, achieving higher ORRs, irrespective of survival, carries clinical significance, as high response translates to better tumor control and, ultimately, an improved quality of life. The positive effect of SII on survival has been reported in NSCLC [22,26], RCC [27], CRC [28], breast [29] and gastric cancers [30], and across a variety of histologies [31]. In our study, low SII levels were an independent predictor of longer OS and PFS, irrespective of other variables, including tumor type. Younger age and better performance status were also independent predictors of longer OS and PFS, in keeping with the known impact of these two factors on survival in cancer patients. In a retrospective analysis of 444 patients with gastric cancer, Wang et al. reported that high SII levels were significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis, independently predicted OS and were superior to NLR for predicting OS [30]. In a meta-analysis of nine studies involving 2441 patients with NSCLC, elevated SII indicated significantly poorer OS, PFS, time to recurrence (TTR) and cancerspecific survival (CSS), and SII showed a significantly higher prognostic value compared to NLR [22]. Similarly, in a retrospective analysis of 1383 patients with CRC, those with low SII levels following radical surgery had better OS and disease-free survival (DFS), and SII was an independent predictor of both OS and DFS [28]. This effect is consistent across several histologies, as a meta-analysis of 22 studies involving 7657 patients reported that high SII correlated with poor OS, TTR, DFS, PFS and CSS, irrespective of the cut-off value, sample size and patients\u2019 ethnicity, thus highlighting high SII as a potential pan-cancer prognostic marker associated with poor outcomes [31]. A limitation of our study is the retrospective nature of the clinical database and potential site-related variations in data reporting, as well as selection bias. Similarly, the independent consecutive selection of patients in both subgroups (<80 vs. \u226580) did not allow for a strict control of potential age-related covariables. As such, a propensitymatching system could have been performed to reduce such bias and balance the impact of covariables across both subgroups. Also, the cut-off values for the inflammatory markers were determined internally according to the ROC analysis. These cut-offs were derived from a large sample size and are comparable to previously published studies, providing indirect validation of the ROC analysis [26,29,30]. Nevertheless, prospective studies are still needed to externally validate the selected values. Our clinical cohort is heterogeneous, reflecting different disease stages, histologies and therapies. For example, around 25% of patients had stages I-III of a disease compared to stage IV, and were included in the survival analysis. While this should be taken with caution while drawing conclusions, the fact that OS and PFS benefits based on SII status were observed in the multivariate analysis independent of the aforementioned co-variables suggests a solid pan-cancer prognostic value for SII. Last, and to account for biologic age differences across individual patients (rather than calendar age), it would be interesting in the future to directly explore the impact of NLR and SII (high vs. low), independent of age."
