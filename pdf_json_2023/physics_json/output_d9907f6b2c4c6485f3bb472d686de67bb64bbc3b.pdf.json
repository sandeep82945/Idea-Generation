We here identified, in a heterologous system, heteromers formed by the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), which is a target for neuroprotection, and an olfactory receptor. A2AR interacts with the receptor family 51, subfamily E,member 2 (OR51E2), thehumanorthologof themouseOlfr-78,whose mRNA is differentially expressed in activatedmicroglia treatedwith adenosine receptor ligands. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays were performed in HEK-293T cells expressing the human version of the receptors, OR51E2 and A2AR, fused, respectively, toRenilla luciferase (RLuc) and the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). BRET data was consistent with a receptor-receptor interaction whose consequences at the functional level were measured by cAMP level determination in CHO cells. Results showed an olfactory receptor-mediated partial blockade of Gs coupling to the A2AR, i.e., the effect of the A2AR selective agonist on intracellular levels of cAMP was significantly reduced. Two odorants, menthol and 1,8-cineole, which failed to show Golf-mediatedOR51E2 activation because they did not increase cytosolic cAMP levels, reduced the BRET readings in cells expressing A2AR-YFP andOR51E2-Rluc, most likely suggesting a conformational change of at least one receptor. These odorants led to an almost complete block of A2AR coupling to Gs.\nKEYWORDS\nG protein-coupled receptor, heteromer, receptor-receptor interactions, signaling, adenosine receptor, olfactory receptor, neuroprotection\nIntroduction\nThe olfactory receptor (OLFR) gene family is the largest in the mammalian genome (Buck and Axel, 1991), suggesting relevance of olfaction for survival and Evolution [see (Snyder et al., 1988; Dryer and Berghard, 1999; Gaillard et al., 2004) for review].

OLFR nomenclature for a given organism, for instance mouse, is different from that for others (see https://www.orthodb. org/?ncbi=1&query=259049). The proteins encoded by the OLFR genes belong to the well-studied superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, there are two main reasons that explain the paucity of data relative to OLFRs in contrast to the large amount of information for the remaining members of class A GPCRs: i) the lack of pharmacological tools (agonists/antagonists), and ii) the difficult expression in heterologous systems (Alexander et al., 2021). The lack of tools has delayed the demonstration of whether OLFRs may be involved in receptor-receptor interactions as has been confirmed for other GPCRs, namely, for class C, class A, and taste receptors (Gines et al., 2000; Duthey et al., 2002; Hillion et al., 2002; Kniazeff et al., 2011; Kuhn and Meyerhof, 2013; Brugarolas et al., 2014; Fujita et al., 2014; Franco et al., 2016; Pin and Bettler, 2016).\nAdenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), a class A GPCR, is considered a target for neuroprotection. In the central nervous system, the receptor is widely expressed in striatal neurons, although it is also present in neurons in other brain regions as well as glia. In the microglia surrounding brain lesions of Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients, the receptor is upregulated (Angulo et al., 2003). Relevant to therapeutic drug development has been the approval of istradefylline, a selective A2AR antagonist, as a first-in-class drug for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease (Jenner et al., 2009; Jenner et al., 2021; Mizuno et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2017; Berger et al., 2020; Mori et al., 2022). Istradefylline targets the A2AR which often interacts with other GPCRs on the cell surface as dopamine and cannabinoid receptors (see https://www.gpcrhetnet.com/ for more interactions involving the receptors; accessed on 13 November 2022). The formation of such complexes is physiologically relevant since heteromers display functional properties that are not possible when receptors act as monomers/homomers (Ciruela et al., 2006; Fuxe et al., 2007; Brugarolas et al., 2014; Franco et al., 2018; Franco et al., 2021; Gallo et al., 2019).\nOn the homo/heteromerization potential of OLFRs, this sentence in a 2005 paper still holds true: \u201cGiven the large number of OLFRs in mammals, the specificity and functional importance if heteromerization of the vast majority of receptors in this family remain to be determined\u201d (Prinster et al., 2005). The present article, whose objective was to search for interactions involving OLFRs, has taken advantage of the results of a transcriptomic study (data in preparation) showing that an OLFR, coded by the Olfr-78 gene (mouse nomenclature), is differentially expressed when mouse primary activated microglial cells are treated with A2AR antagonists. Therefore, we reasoned that a first approach to the possibility that OLFRs could form receptor-receptor complexes was to determine whether this specific OLFR was capable of interacting with the A2AR in a heterologous system. Although the expression and relevance of OLFRs in general and of Olfr-78 in particular outside the olfactory system has not been widely studied, it was reported three years ago that the Olfr-78 gene product is expressed in the intestine and is involved in the response to colitis (Kotlo et al., 2020). Here, we have used bioluminescence energy transfer (BRET) assays to discover, in a heterologous expression\nsystem, a direct interaction between the human version of the A2AR and the Homo sapiens ortholog of Olfr-78, namely, the olfactory 51E2 receptor (OR51E2). In both cells expressing the A2AR and cells expressing the A2A-51E2 receptor heteromer, the effect of two odorants whose specific receptors have yet to be identified, menthol and 1,8-cineole, was studied by measuring intracellular cAMP levels."

The plasmid coding for the fusion protein hOR51E2-RLuc (hOR51E2-RLuc) was provided by VectorBuilder (Chicago, IL, United States); the sequence for OR51E2 used to prepare the plasmid pRP[Exp]-CAG > hOR51E2 [NM_030774.3](ns):3xGGGGS:Rluc (Vector IDVB2204261096mmj) corresponds to that of [NM_030774.3] and may be found in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=81285 (accessed on 22 November 2022).\nCell culture and transient transfection\nHuman embryonic Kidney HEK-293T (batch 612968), acquired from the American-Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, United States), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were amplified and the aliquots stored in liquid nitrogen. Cells from each aliquot were used until passage 19. Cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Waltham, MA, United States) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, MEM non-essential amino acid solution (1/100) and 5% (v/v) heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (all supplements were from Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland, United Kingdom), and maintained in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. Cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding cDNAs using the PEI (PolyEthylenImine, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) method as previously described (Carriba et al., 2008; Navarro et al., 2012). Four h after transfection, growth medium was replaced by complete medium. Experiments were carried out 48 h later.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\nBioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays\nHEK-293T cells growing in 6-well plates were transiently cotransfected with a constant amount of cDNA encoding for hOR51E2-RLuc (1.5 \u03bcg) and with increasing amounts of cDNA for hA2AR-YFP (0.2\u20134 \u03bcg). 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice in quick succession with HBSS (137 mM NaCl; 5 mM KCl; 0.34 mM Na2HPO4; 0.44 mM KH2PO4; 1.26 mM CaCl2; 0.4 mM MgSO4; 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% glucose (w/v), detached by gently pipetting and resuspended in the same buffer. Cells were counted using an automatic counting device (Benchmark QuadCount Automated Cell Counter, Sigma-Aldrich) and used when viability, as assessed by 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, was >95%. To quantify YFP-fluorescence expression, cells were distributed (20 \u03bcg protein) in 96-well plates (black plates with a transparent bottom; Porvair, Leatherhead, United Kingdom). Fluorescence was read using a FluoStar Optima fluorimeter (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) equipped with a high-energy xenon flash lamp, reading at 530 nm. YFP-fluorescence expression was determined as the fluorescence of the sample minus the fluorescence of cells only expressing protein-RLuc. Odorant action was measured using sealed 96-well plates having odorants, menthol or 1,8-cineole [different white plates (Porvair) for each], at a concentration of 5 M in the peripheral wells (100 \u00b5L/well) and leaving one file and one row without any cell/reagent. Cells and other reagents were placed in the rest of the wells. For BRET measurements, coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added (5 \u00b5M final concentration) 15 min after sealing the plates with odorants, and 60 s later, readings were collected using aMithras LB 940 (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany), which allowed the integration of the signals detected in the short-wavelength filter at 485 nm (475\u2013495 nm) and the long-wavelength filter at 530 nm (520\u2013540 nm). The net BRET is defined as [(long-wavelength emission)/(short-wavelength emission)]-Cf where Cf corresponds to [(long-wavelength emission)/(short-wavelength emission)] for the RLuc construct expressed alone in the same experiment. To quantify receptor-RLuc expression, luminescence readings were collected 10 min after 5 \u03bcM coelenterazine H addition. An equivalent plate was prepared, sealed and processed, but in the absence of odorants. The BRET curves were fitted by non-linear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA, United States).

Then, cells were detached, resuspended in non-supplemented medium containing 50 \u03bcM zardaverine, and plated in 384-well microplates (2,500 cells/well). Plates were described as in the previous section. Cells were exposed to odorants for 15 min prior A2AR activation using 100 nM of a selective agonist, CGS21680; 15 min later the process was stopped by\nthe addition of the Eu-cAMP tracer and the ULight-cAMP monoclonal antibody prepared in the \u201ccAMP detection buffer\u201d provided by PerkinElmer. All steps were performed at 25\u00b0C. Homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (HTRF) measures were performed 60 min after incubation using the LanceUltra cAMP kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, United States). Fluorescence at 665 nm was analyzed on a PHERAstar Flagship microplate reader equipped with an HTRF optical module (BMGLab technologies, Offenburg, Germany). The effect of CGS21680 was calculated respect to the basal levels in each condition: vehicle, exposed to menthol or exposed to 1,8-cineole."

            "text": "The OR51E2 and the A2AR may establish direct interactions in living cells\nHEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs coding for the human version of the receptors fused to either a BRET donor (RLuc) or acceptor (YFP). The BRET signal was saturable in cells expressing a constant amount of hOR51E2RLuc and increasing amounts of hA2AR-YFP (Figure 1A), thus indicating a direct interaction between the two proteins. The BRET parameters were: BRETmax = 155 \u00b1 3 mBU and BRET50 = 0.072 \u00b1 0.007. In contrast, no interaction was detected in cells expressing hOR51E2-RLuc and the cannabinoid CB1 receptorYFP fusion protein because the BRET relationship was linear (Figure 1A). Two odorants, menthol and 1,8-cineole, whose specific OLFRs are unknown, led to a reduction of the BRET signal in cells expressing hOR51E2-RLuc and hA2AR-YFP. As shown in Figure 1B, BRETmax in the presence of odorants was significantly reduced. These results suggest conformational changes in the h51E2/A2A receptor heteromer leading to a variation in the distance between donor and acceptor, i.e., menthol or 1,8-cineole increased the distance between RLuc and YFP fused to, respectively, the OR51E2 and the A2AR. The possibility of a slight reduction in the number of heteromers caused by odorants cannot be ruled out.\nA2AR-mediated signaling in CHO cells expressing the A2AR and in cells also expressing the 51E2/A2A receptor heteromer\nIn preliminary assays, we discovered that the effect of A2AR agonists was reduced when the OR51E2 was coexpressed. To have a readout of the expression of the hA2AR we decided to use the hA2AR-GFP\n2 fusion protein for the signaling assays. The adenosine receptor couples to heterotrimeric Gs proteins and, therefore, its activation by agonists leads to activation of adenylate cyclase and, subsequently, to increases in intracellular cAMP levels. The increase of intracellular cAMP concentration in response to 200 nM CGS21680, a selective A2AR agonist, was significant in CHO cells expressing the hA2AR-GFP\n2 (Figure 2). The effect was reduced when the OR51E2 was also expressed thus suggesting a blockade of A2AR/ Gs-mediated signaling upon formation of the adenosine-olfactory receptor complex. The decrease in the response was similar when\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03\ncells were transfected with 0.75 ng/\u03bcL and with 1.5 ng/\u03bcL cDNA for the OR51E2 (Figure 2A). Assessment of the expression of the hA2AR-GFP\n2 by means of fluorescence readings showed that the expression of the protein was similar in all cases (between 5800 and 6400 relative units) with the highest value in cells transfected with the cDNA for the hA2AR-GFP\n2 and 1.5 ng/\u03bcL cDNA for the OR51E2. To further confirm that the partial blockade was specifically due to the coexpression of the OLFR, similar assays were performed in cells expressing the hA2AR-GFP\n2 and the cannabinoid CB2 receptor (CB2R), which forms heteromers with each other (Franco et al., 2019; Franco et al., 2019).\nCoexpression of adenosine and cannabinoid receptors using 0.75 ng/\u03bcL cDNA for the CB2R did not lead to any significant decrease in the response to CGS21680; increasing the expression level of the CB2R by using 1.5 ng/\u03bcL cDNA led to a decrease in signaling that was significant but much less than that achieved by OR51E2 expression. These results suggest that expression of the OR51E2 and the formation of heteromers with the A2AR leads to a significant reduction in the response triggered by the A2AR agonist.\nThe effect of the odorants was tested in cells expressing the hA2AR, the OR51E2 or both. First, it was assayed whether the presence of\nFIGURE 1 Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. (A) BRET assays were performed in HEK-293T cells cotransfected with a constant amount of cDNA for hOR51E2-RLuc (1.5 \u03bcg) and increasing amounts of cDNA for hA2AR-YFP (0.2\u20134 \u03bcg). Similar assays were performed in cells placed in an atmosphere containing menthol or 1,8-cineole (See Methodology for experimental details). HEK-293T cells transfected with a constant amount of hOR51E2R-Rluc cDNA (1.5 \u03bcg) and increasing amounts of cannabinoid CB1 receptor-YFP cDNA (0.2\u20134 \u03bcg) were used to provide a negative control. Net BRET (inmilli BRET units) is plotted against the ratio: net YFP fluorescence/luminescence; net YFP fluorescence (530 nm) is obtained subtracting from the total value of 530 nm readings the autofluorescence of cells expressing the donor protein but not the YFP-containing acceptor.

The results showed that this is not the case since CGS21680 did not elicit any response in these cells (Figure 3A). Furthermore, we found that none of the odorants were able to participate in Golf/s-mediated signaling in CHO cells expressing the OR51E2. (Figure 3B). Finally, menthol and 1,8-cineole decreased the basal levels of intracellular cAMP in cells expressing the hA2AR, alone or in combination with the OR51E2 (Figures 3C, D). Interestingly, the effect of CGS21680 wasmarkedly reduced, almost neglected, in the cells previously exposed to menthol or 1,8-cineole. This result was similar in cells expressing the A2AR or coexpressing the two receptors (Figures 3C, D)."

            "text": "Despite constituting a highly populated family of the mammalian proteome, OLFRs are poorly characterized due to the lack of\npharmacological tools. The sequences of the genes and the primary structure of OLFRs show that these proteins belong to the GPCR superfamily. Also of note, the heterotrimeric G proteins that mediate olfaction are known as \u201cGolf\u201d (\u201colf\u201d for olfactory). Golf proteins were first discovered in sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium (Jones and Reed, 1989); shortly thereafter they were identified in the basal ganglia where they were supposed to mediate dopaminergic neurotransmission (Drinnan et al., 1991). Interestingly, the A2AR is enriched in the basal ganglia where it colocalizes and activates Golf (Kull et al., 2000). In fact, there are two G proteins to which the A2AR may couple: Golf and Gs (Alexander et al., 2019). Given the findings of this study, it is tempting to speculate whether the coupling of A2AR to Golf is direct or mediated by heteromerization with Golf-coupled OLFRs.\nUnlike other GPCRs for which the physiological agonist is well known, there is little indication of physiological agonists and/or volatile compounds capable of activating OLFRs. One of the unknown aspects of these receptors is whether they are able to establishing receptorreceptor interactions, as it is the case with members of other GPCR\nFIGURE 3 Effect of menthol or 1,8-cineole in A2AR-mediated signaling. cAMP levels were determined, as described in Methodology, in CHO cells treated with 200 nM CGS21680 (CGS), the selective A2AR agonist.

In fact, the relevance of GPCR heteromerization to understand the actual function of OLFRs, under physiological conditions, and their actual potential as targets for therapy is becoming clearer. The results in this paper show that neither menthol nor 1,8-cineole can engage the putative Golf/s that could be coupled to the OR51E2 (Figure 3). The minimal changes observed by the action of menthol or 1,8-cineole were observed both in cells expressing the A2AR and in cells expressing the A2AR and the OR51E2. Therefore, these two odorants are unlikely to directly interact with the OR51E2, unless the receptor is not coupled to Golf but to another signal transduction pathway.\nThe main result of this paper is the demonstration that the human A2AR can interact with the humanOR51E2 in a heterologous system. The discovery of this interaction is relevant as it shows, for the first time, that OLFRs can participate in receptor-receptor interactions as has already been shown for rhodopsin-like class A, for class C and for taste GPCRs (Borroto-Escuela et al., 2014). However, understanding the physiological significance of the finding will require further investigation. Our results prove that heteromer formation correlates with a sharp reduction of the Gs-mediated signaling triggered by A2AR agonists. In some heteromeric settings, activation of one of the receptors is required for crosstalk between receptors and regulation of signal transduction. Within the 51E2/A2A receptor heteromer, adenosinergic signaling is reduced even in the absence of OLFR activation. This result indicates that there are marked conformational changes in the structure of the A2AR when the OR51E2 is present. There are examples of regulation of signaling simply through the coexpression of two receptors. One is the heteromer formed byA2AR and another adenosine receptor, A3, which couples toGi. Within the A2A-A3 receptor heteromer, the A3R-mediated signaling is blocked when the two receptors are coexpressed; blockade is detectable both in a heterologous expression system and in primary striatal neurons from mouse brain (Lillo et al., 2020).\nIf the interaction has physiological relevance, there are two different scenarios that are not mutually exclusive. One involves the cells in which the A2AR might be expressed in the olfactory system. In the upper respiratory tract, both A2A and A2B adenosine receptors have been shown to regulate mucociliary clearance in the nose, where OLFRs are primarily expressed (Hua et al., 2013). The second scenario would consist of a non-olfactory system in which A2AR andOR51E2 are jointly expressed in a certain cell type.HansHatt is known for being the scientist who best understood the relevance of \u201cectopic\u201dOLFRs, that is, receptors located outside the nose that exert non-olfactory actions. After intense work over decades, he and his colleagues have reviewed research suggesting roles of OLFRs outside the nose and speculating about their potential as therapeutic targets (Ma\u00dfberg and Hatt, 2018; Lee et al., 2019). Using kidney cells, Hatt and others suggested that themouse ortholog of OR51E2, Olfr78, might respond to propionate, which would then become an odorless physiological ligand for the receptor (Pluznick et al., 2013). Noteworthy, the Olfr-78 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal system and its expression is reduced in two experimental models of colitis (Kotlo et al., 2020). In the same study it was proven that OR51E2 is expressed in human colon (Kotlo et al., 2020). Recently, this OLFR has been found in a variety of mouse central nervous system cells, including microglia and vasopressin/oxytocin neurons (Nakashima et al., 2022).\nTo the best of our knowledge, the OLFRs involved in the sense of odor produced by menthol or 1,8-cineole have not been identified. The experiments reported here with odorants also provided limited but\nrelevant information. First, menthol and 1,8-cineole reduced heteromer formation and/or affected the conformation of the receptor-receptor complex, as detected by a significant decrease in BRETmax (Figure 1). This effect can be direct, on one of the receptors. As discussed above, menthol or 1,8-cineole do not appear to interact with the OR51E2. Conversely, it cannot be completely ruled out that odorants interact with the A2AR, as both were able to markedly reduce the Gs-mediated response elicited by the A2AR agonist. Supporting this view is the negative regulation occurring in both cells expressing the A2AR and in cells coexpressing A2A and 51E2 receptors. In summary, menthol and 1,8-cineole do not seem to activate the OR51E2, but they block Gs-mediated signaling suggesting that a direct interaction of these odorants with the adenosine receptor is possible. Otherwise, these odorants could interact with the membrane components surrounding the heteromer, thus affecting its overall structure."
