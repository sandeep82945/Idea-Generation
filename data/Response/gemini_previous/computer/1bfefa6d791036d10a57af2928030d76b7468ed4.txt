1. **Investigate the performance of CAS elements for nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shells.** The current study considers linear Kirchhoff-Love shells, but it would be interesting to investigate the performance of CAS elements for nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shells. This would involve developing a nonlinear version of the CAS element formulation and then testing it on a variety of nonlinear benchmark problems.


2. **Develop CAS elements for other types of shells.** The current study focuses on Kirchhoff-Love shells, but it would be interesting to develop CAS elements for other types of shells, such as Reissner-Mindlin shells and Sanders-Koiter shells. This would involve developing new assumed strain fields that are appropriate for these different types of shells.


3. **Investigate the use of CAS elements in isogeometric analysis (IGA).** IGA is a relatively new approach to finite element analysis that uses NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) to represent the geometry of the model. CAS elements could be used in IGA to develop locking-free discretizations of shell structures. This would involve developing a NURBS-based version of the CAS element formulation and then testing it on a variety of IGA benchmark problems.


4. **Develop a posteriori error estimators for CAS elements.** A posteriori error estimators are used to estimate the error in a finite element solution. This information can be used to adaptively refine the mesh, which can lead to more accurate solutions with fewer degrees of freedom. It would be interesting to develop a posteriori error estimators for CAS elements. This would involve developing a method for estimating the error in the CAS element solution and then testing it on a variety of benchmark problems.


5. **Implement CAS elements in a commercial finite element software package.** In order to make CAS elements more widely available, it would be beneficial to implement them in a commercial finite element software package. This would allow engineers and analysts to use CAS elements to solve real-world problems.
