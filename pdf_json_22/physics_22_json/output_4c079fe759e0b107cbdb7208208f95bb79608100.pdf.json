    "abstractText": "We report deterministic control over moir\u00e9 superlattice interference pattern in twisted bilayer graphene by implementing designable device-level heterostrain with process-induced strain engineering, a widely used technique in industrial silicon nanofabrication processes. By depositing stressed thin films onto our twisted bilayer graphene samples, heterostrain magnitude and strain directionality can be controlled by stressor film force (film stress \u00d7 film thickness) and patterned stressor geometry, respectively. We examine strain and moir\u00e9 interference with Raman spectroscopy through in-plane and moir\u00e9-activated phonon mode shifts. Results support systematic C3 rotational symmetry breaking and tunable periodicity in moir\u00e9 superlattices under the application of uniaxial or biaxial heterostrain. Experimental results are validated by molecular statics simulations and density functional theory based first principles calculations. This provides a method to not only tune moir\u00e9 interference without additional twisting, but also allows for a systematic pathway to explore different van der Waals based moir\u00e9 superlattice symmetries by deterministic design.",

            "text": "We report deterministic control over moir\u00e9 superlattice interference pattern in twisted bilayer graphene by implementing designable device-level heterostrain with process-induced strain engineering, a widely used technique in industrial silicon nanofabrication processes. By depositing stressed thin films onto our twisted bilayer graphene samples, heterostrain magnitude and strain directionality can be controlled by stressor film force (film stress \u00d7 film thickness) and patterned stressor geometry, respectively. We examine strain and moir\u00e9 interference with Raman spectroscopy through in-plane and moir\u00e9-activated phonon mode shifts. Results support systematic C3 rotational symmetry breaking and tunable periodicity in moir\u00e9 superlattices under the application of uniaxial or biaxial heterostrain. Experimental results are validated by molecular statics simulations and density functional theory based first principles calculations. This provides a method to not only tune moir\u00e9 interference without additional twisting, but also allows for a systematic pathway to explore different van der Waals based moir\u00e9 superlattice symmetries by deterministic design.\nWhen heterostructures of stacked 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials are constructed with a relative twist between the layers, in-plane moir\u00e9 interference patterns are created that vary in periodicity depending on angle. This in-plane superlattice effect can lead to the formation of flat-bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near a \u201cmagic-angle\u201d, which can cause strong electron interactions1-5. Within this system alone, an amazing number of strongly correlated electronic phases appear that may be tuned by band filling1-6. Within the broader class of twisted vdW systems, including semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, there have also been reports of both similar electronic phases and strongly interacting optical phases7-12.\nCritically, these systems rely on the built-in moir\u00e9 interference patterns formed from only twisting layers. The total space of possible moir\u00e9 interference patterns is much larger when accounting for strain in each individual layer along with twist (Fig. 1). By individually straining one layer with respect to the other (heterostrain), substantial moir\u00e9 tunability can be achieved. Specifically, biaxial or uniaxial heterostrain in twisted bilayer 2D heterostructures provides a pathway to manipulate the period of moir\u00e9 interference (Fig. 1b) or change the geometry of the interference pattern (Fig. 1d). Much of the correlated electronic physics in twisted bilayer vdW systems can be understood in the framework of the Hubbard model, with symmetry of the Hubbard lattice, the Coulomb repulsion (U) and hopping (t) terms all set by twist angle alone13-15. A greatly expanded set of available lattice symmetries, and direct control over U/t is possible with deterministic heterostrain in twisted bilayer 2D systems (Fig. 1), allowing an opportunity to better understand correlated electronic phases or serve as a basis for predicting new phases.\nOne key missing factor in exploring any of these concepts is the deterministic and continuous control of layer-by-layer strain, which has been lacking in the community studying twisted vdW moir\u00e9 materials16. Some works have explored the effects of applied heterostrain through probing uncontrollable heterostrain from fabrication processes17,18, engineered lattice mismatched epitaxial growth19, and bending bilayers on flexible substrates20, but there is a need for a general method compatible with all experimental probes and conditions. Systematic exploration of the strain-expanded phase space of 2D moir\u00e9 quantum materials requires deterministic application of layer-by-layer strain on the device-level, compatible at low temperatures, with full control over uniaxiality vs. biaxiality. Here, we present a method that meets all the above criteria with the deposition of highly stressed thin film capping layers (process-induced strain). We demonstrate that heterostrain magnitude is directly proportional to the film force (film stress [GPa] \u00d7 film thickness [nm]) of the stressor layer, and strain directionality is controlled by stressor geometry (Fig. 1a,c).\nProcess-induced strain engineering has been implemented in industrial silicon technology since\nthe 90 nm technology node, to selectively enhance electron or hole mobility in transistor channels21-23. In our previous work, this concept was proven to be equally versatile on vdW bonded 2D materials through evaporating highly stressed thin films onto various 2D multilayer flakes and heterostructures24-26. In these works, we show that process-induced strain can allow for the deterministic design over strain magnitude, tension or compression, uniaxiality or biaxiality, and strain direction relative to the crystal axes24,25. These methods when applied to 2D materials do not induce damage, are highly time stable and low-temperature compatible26. Moreover, we also find incomplete out-of-plane strain transfer (heterostrain) naturally occurs in 2D structures from this method because of their weak vdW coupling27, allowing for engineered layer-by-layer control over strain in 2D materials.\nIn this Letter, we apply process-induced strain to controllably heterostrain TBG structures to\nengineer the moir\u00e9 periodicity and symmetry. Because bilayer graphene has weak interlayer coupling, we\ncan strain the top graphene layer in this system, while the bottom layer is fixed to the substrate and entirely unstrained24,28. This method is general to all 2D materials where substrate adhesion is higher than interlayer adhesion and can be integrated with complex device structures on-chip, meeting all the criteria to examine these systems with low-temperature quantum transport experiments.\nRaman spectroscopy is a popular, nondestructive method to extract details about strain, doping,\nand sample quality in 2D systems such as graphene and MoS2 29,30. Specifically in high-angle TBG structures, an additional phonon mode is activated by the moir\u00e9 superlattice, whose phonon frequency can be related back to the twist angle between the two monolayers (Fig. 2a,b)31. To understand this mode in TBG, one could look at the superlattice in reciprocal space, where two monolayer graphene Brillouin zones (BZs) are rotated by the given twist angle (\u03b8) with respect to each other. The BZ of the moir\u00e9 interference pattern (moir\u00e9-BZ) has reciprocal lattice vectors q1 and q2 (Fig. 2c), extracted from the difference between the monolayer reciprocal lattice vectors. The TBG\u2019s moir\u00e9 activated phonon mode, termed as the R' (R) band, has a frequency dependent on the magnitude of vector q1,2. The R' (R) bands can be understood as the phonon dispersion curves along the \u0393-K direction in bilayer graphene, where the longitudinal and transverse optical phonon branches (LO & TO) are active for twist angles below and above ~10\u00b0 respectively (see supplementary, Fig. 2b)32,33. Since the vector q1,2 of the moir\u00e9-BZ is derived from the real-space superlattice vectors (Fig. 2c), this allows Raman analysis to provide information about strain-transfer and the subsequent real-space changes to the superlattice periodicity simultaneously in these structures. This is illustrated in Fig. 2d, where biaxial heterostrain uniformly increases the magnitude of q1,2, while uniaxial heterostrain both increases and decreases the magnitude of q1 and q2 respectively. This leads to the effects seen in R' (R) band manipulation by heterostrain in the following sections.\nWe initially apply biaxial strain to the top layer in TBG structures (11\u00b0 < \u03b8 < 16\u00b0, 5 TBG samples\nin total), then probe changes in the in-plane (G-peak) and the superlattice phonon modes (R-peak) with increasing biaxial strain magnitude. Biaxial strain is expected since the thin film stressor would contract to relieve tensile stress from all directions thus transferring biaxial strain to top layer in contact with the stressor, as shown in our previous works24,25. Raman spectroscopy is conducted on the TBG/SiO2/Si sample before and after full encapsulation with a highly stressed tensile stressor (Fig. S1). Strain magnitude is directly proportional to thin film force application [N m-1] of the stressor layer, we choose to vary this parameter by varying stressor thickness (see supplementary information)34. Film force of the stressor layer is quantified via standard wafer curvature methods, then employing the Stoney equation35,36.\nSince biaxial strain is being applied to the top graphene layer, the superlattice is expected to retain\nC3 rotational symmetry, while the real-space moir\u00e9 periodicity will decrease, and the magnitude of vector q1,2 will increase (Fig. 2d). We quantify phonon shifts as the difference of pre- and post-encapsulation Raman peak positions (\u2206\u03c9 = \u03c9after \u2013 \u03c9before), where we observe a redshift in the R-band and blueshift in the G-band in all samples after thin film stressor encapsulation (Fig. 3a). The redshift in \u2206\u03c9R matches the expected increase in |q1,2| and the blueshift in \u2206\u03c9G confirms compressive strain transfer to the top graphene layer. Raman spectroscopic maps of the R-band peak positions before and after a 32 N m-1 thin film force application on a TBG sample (\u03b8 ~ 14\u00b0) are shown in Fig. 3b-d, showing good uniformity of heterostrain application. Before encapsulation, the TBG sample displays an average R-band peak position of 1461.1 \u00b1 0.15 cm-1. After the 32 N m-1 encapsulation, we extract a new average R-band peak position of 1456.7 \u00b1 0.17 cm-1. We repeat this procedure on four more TBG samples varying in film force application, where we find the magnitude of both the R-band and G-band shifts scale linearly with thin film force application (Fig. 3e,f), demonstrating direct controllability of heterostrain.\nWe next calculate the expected phonon frequency shifts with varying biaxial compressive strain\nmagnitudes to the top graphene layer in a simulated 13.2\u00b0 TBG, using a combination of molecular statics (MS) and density functional theory (DFT) (see supplementary). Slopes of -30.48 cm-1/% and 10.21 cm1/% are obtained for \u0394\u03c9R and \u0394\u03c9G,top with applied strain respectively from these calculations. While a peak shift rate of 10.21 cm-1/% for the G-band is smaller than literature values for biaxially strained graphene37, Raman shifts per % strain are unique to both the nature of applied strain and to the 2D material structure itself. Because this is the only time biaxial heterostrain on TBG has been probed with Raman spectroscopy, we utilize our experimental peak shifts to validate and compare with our theoretical calculations. To independently compare experimental peak shifts as a function of strain, we estimate the % biaxial strain in the graphene top layer from film force alone. This is obtained by scaling our own result from biaxially strained monolayer MoS2 24 by the relative elastic moduli between graphene and MoS2. Since graphene has a 3.5 times larger elastic modulus than MoS2, the same film force will generate 3.5 times less strain. The experimental and calculated results are presented together in Fig. 3e,f where there is good agreement between measured peak shifts and simulated values. Thus, we have cross-verified that biaxial heterostrain is being applied to TBG and this directly leads to modification of the moir\u00e9-BZ (periodicity) in the expected fashion. We do not expect to resolve the G-peak of each individual layer of graphene, because the G-peaks have a much larger peak width (~12 cm-1) than this peak shift itself (~2 cm-1), however we do observe this as an increase in the measured G-peak width of ~0.65 cm-1.\nThis good agreement between theory and experiment validates biaxial heterostrain as a mechanism\nto engineer moir\u00e9 wavelength, since R-band shifts can directly be mapped back to changes in q1,2, and changes to q1,2 represent changes to real-space moir\u00e9 interference. These same real space modifications are observed through MS simulations, and subsequently match experimental Raman results one-to-one (Fig. 3e,f). Therefore, these results directly show a closed-loop theoretical/experimental approach to quantitatively engineer moir\u00e9 periodicity, controlled continuously through biaxial heterostrain.\nWe now examine designed uniaxial heterostrain to TBG structures. Strain directionality\n(uniaxiality vs. biaxiality) can be redefined by lithographically patterning the thin film stressors into stripes and modifying the width of the stripe38. Uniaxial heterostrain is quite powerful for moir\u00e9 superlattices particularly because this type of strain can change the geometry of the moir\u00e9 interference pattern from the typical triangular lattice to more complex patterns (Fig. 1d). To explore this effect, we first lithographically pattern a 2.5 \u03bcm wide thin film stressor stripe (40 N m-1) onto a 6\u00b0 TBG sample (Fig. 4b), where the strain is determined to be uniaxial and perpendicular to the direction of the stripe (Fig S5), similar to our results in the past25.\nPrior to thin film stressor deposition, we confirm the TBG sample displays uniform G and R' peak\npositions throughout the sample (Fig. S3). After a 40 N m-1 thin film stripe application, outside the stressor displays the same G and R' positions as before the stressor deposition, then at the center of the stripe we observe both G and R' peak splitting (Fig. 4a). The G peak splitting in this sample arises from heterostrain, where each peak represents the G-peak of an individual layer. This is different than the typical G and G' (E2g + and E2g - ) peak splitting in individual graphene monolayers due to uniaxial strain that arises from lattice symmetry breaking, since we are well under the limit of strain magnitudes where this is a resolvable effect (\u03b5uniaxial < 0.6%) 39. The lower G-peak matches the unstrained (control) G-peak value in the TBG sample of ~1588.5 cm-1, therefore represents the signal from the unstrained bottom layer. The upper Gpeak is blueshifted by ~10.9 cm-1, we can estimate 0.21% compressive uniaxial strain to the top graphene layer when compensating for charge transfer contributions to the G-peak (Fig. S3,4). We can resolve G\npeak splitting from heterostrain in the uniaxial case (but not the biaxial case), because there is a larger Raman shift rate per % applied strain.\nWhile the G-peak splitting is due to contributions from each individual graphene layer, R'-peaks\narise from the combined interaction between both graphene layers. Therefore, the splitting of this peak represents a direct modification to the moir\u00e9 pattern itself. Under uniaxial heterostrain, we have shown that q1 and q2 vectors both increase and decrease in magnitude, arising from the breaking of the superlattice symmetry of unstrained or biaxially strained moir\u00e9 interference (Fig. 1d, 2d). Since the R' peak positions are directly related to the reciprocal space lattice vectors for the moir\u00e9-BZ (q1,q2), this peak splitting represents direct evidence of C3 rotational symmetry breaking in the moir\u00e9 superlattice in TBG under deterministic application uniaxial heterostrain. We\u2019ve seen this repeated across two other samples with patterned stressors and different film forces, where the G and R' peak splittings scale with film force application (Fig. S6).\nTo quantitatively confirm that the splitting and changes in \u03c9R' originate from changes in the moir\u00e9\nsuperlattice symmetry/periodicity, we also conduct Raman spectroscopic mapping over the entire sample (Fig. 4b). When conducting Raman mapping, we observe clear correlations between both emerging R' peaks (Fig. 4c,d) and the Gtop peak position (Fig. 4e). Strain gradients are found at the edges of the thin film stressor (Fig. 4c-e, S5b), indicating a full range of uniaxial heterostrain engineered by stressor geometry. To examine this more clearly, we plot the R' peak shifts as a function of Gtop peak shifts (Fig. 4f symbols) and observe a one-to-one linear correlation between the Gtop and individual R' peak shifts, as expected from a full gradient of moir\u00e9 interference patterns designed by uniaxial heterostrain within a single sample. We again calculate the phonon responses of a simulated heterostrained 6\u00b0 TBG structure using MS+DFT to compare with our experimental data, where we find that the calculated phonon shifts match well to the experimental Raman data (dashed lines in Fig. 4f). R' peak shifts per percent strain follow 34.83 cm-1/% and -20.51 cm-1/%, while the averaged Gtop peak shift slope is 46.77 cm -1/%.\nUsing our measured Gtop and R' peak shifts, we can directly back-calculate the exact moir\u00e9-BZ\nand visualize the subsequent real-space moir\u00e9 superlattice at the center of the stressor (Fig. 5b). To illustrate the impact of uniaxial heterostrain application, we present the full evolution of MS+DFT simulated 6\u00b0 TBG structures in real space under increasing compressive uniaxial heterostrain magnitude from 0% to 1% (Fig. 5). Implementing a combined MS and DFT approach is critical to accurately account for atomic relaxation effects in the simulated heterostrained superlattices40, allowing us to properly obtain the calculated phonon shifts with applied strain (see supplementary).\nHere, we have introduced a method to locally engineer moir\u00e9 periodicity and symmetry in 2D\nbilayer heterostructures by design. While this demonstration implemented ~0.2% heterostrain on TBG, this does not represent an upper limit to the amount of strain that can be applied by our method. Several other theoretical and experimental works suggest that ~0.2% heterostrain is already enough to substantially modify the moir\u00e9 periodicity and subsequently alter the electronic properties in systems like magic-angle TBG18,19,41-44. Moreover, we have engineered other 2D systems up to 0.85%24, with more recent results even reaching 1.5%. The heterostrain applied by process induced strain engineering is general and can be continuously tuned by varying thin film force application and thin film stressor geometry. These heterostrain modifications allow for controlled access to moir\u00e9 interference patterns that are not achievable through twist alone. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach allows for direct inference of the real space moir\u00e9 modifications made through heterostrain, allowing for direct\nquantitative back calculation of the engineered moir\u00e9 patterns from Raman spectroscopic analysis. This closed-loop approach allows for a systematic engineering of moir\u00e9 interference in bilayer 2D heterostructures that has not been achieved deterministically before, opening the door to a strain-expanded exploration of twisted 2D quantum materials by design.\nSupporting Information\nDetails on the MS simulations, DFT calculations, and experimental Raman methods.

            "text": "We performed computational simulations to gain atomistic-level insight of these moir\u00e9\nengineered twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems and characterize them to compare it with experiments. Initially, we considered the Bernal stacked (AB stacking) configuration of bilayer graphene and then rotated the top layer by a twist angle \u03b8 relative to the bottom layer. This incommensurate stacking orientation of layers results in large periodic supercell of the entire system, i.e., the moir\u00e9 patterns1,2. The size of a moir\u00e9 pattern resembles the periodic supercell size of a TBG crystal structure. The mathematical equations pertaining to our model is shown in the next subsection. After constructing rigidly twisted lattice structures of TBG (\u03b8 = 6\u00b0 and \u03b8 = 13.2\u00b0), we performed density functional theory (DFT) simulations to minimize their energy and obtain their relaxed geometries. The minimized lengths of moir\u00e9 superlattice is 2.3502 nm and 1.0728 nm for 6\u00b0 and 13.2\u00b0 TBG systems respectively. Further, to mimic the experimental straining of the system, we conducted molecular statics (MS) simulations (T = 0 K) via energy minimization using LAMMPS3 based on the optimized supercell structure from DFT (see Superlattice Model). We applied strain (uniaxial/biaxial) on the top layer in a step wise manner (strain is applied along the zigzag direction in the uniaxial case). Since this mechanical deformation is applied to an individual layer, we have taken the film to have a free surface boundary in the loading direction. We observe an oblique patterned distortion of moir\u00e9 hexagons which further intensifies with strain due to inequivalent magnitude of q vectors under uniaxial heterostrain application.\nExperimentally obtained Raman peak frequencies can be directly extracted from optical\nbranches of the phonon dispersion spectra of a material along the high symmetry path of its Brillouin zone (BZ)4,5. Ab-initio DFT simulations were implemented to compute the phonon spectrum of TBG systems with and without heterostrain. The moir\u00e9 supercell lattice parameters were calculated for each magnitude of applied strain (see Superlattice Model). By freezing the LAMMPS-simulated atomistic configuration and employing the hetero-strained moir\u00e9 lattice parameters in the structure, we imported the system for DFT calculations to further minimize the system to first principles-level accuracy, followed by phonon spectrum calculations. As explained by Cocemasov et al., we observe hybrid folded phonon branches in the phonon spectra of TBG because of mixture of different BZ directions of the individual layers6. The folded branches were simplified using Phonon Unfolding package7 as shown in along \u0393-K-M-\u0393 high symmetry path. Raman scattering causes inelastic scattering of photons, due to which atoms vibrate out of phase in the lattice. For analyzing the Raman peaks, we consider the longitudinal (LO) and transverse optical (TO) phonon branches as they depict the out of phase vibrational modes of atoms8,9.\nUnfolded optical branches of TBG resemble that of bilayer graphene and has degenerate\nphonon bands6. With the applied heterostrain, the phonon branches split as a result of electron confinement in the individual layers due to inequivalent strain present in each layer10-12. The firstorder Raman scattering can be observed from phonons at its BZ center. Hence, the G-band frequency can be obtained from \u0393 point5. At 0% strain, the LO and TO branch converge at a single frequency at the \u0393 point, which further splits and blueshifts with heterostrain. As the strain is increased, the optical phonon bands of the strained layer further bifurcate corresponding to the doubly degenerate E2g + and E2g - phonons13. The double resonance Raman mechanism in TBG systems involve scattering by the rotational wavevector q, giving rise to R' (R)-band peaks. Using the method demonstrated by Carozo et al, we have calculated the R band frequencies for our TBG models from the LO and TO branches8,9. The governing mechanism of intra-valley and inter-valley\nscattering determines the relevant branch for R' (R) peak frequencies (LO \u03b8 = 6\u00b0 and TO for \u03b8 = 13.2\u00b0). Phonon frequencies corresponding to the magnitude of q vectors can be directly utilized to obtain the R band data. The mathematical expressions used to calculate q vectors of strained TBG is shown in the Superlattice Model. Like in the G band, we observe splitting of R' band peaks with strain. When uniaxial heterostrain is applied, we obtain unequal magnitude of q1 and q2 vectors. On deriving the R' band peaks corresponding to these vectors for the split optical phonon branches, we observe that with strain the R' band splits into four peaks separated into two branches (two peaks blueshifting and two redshifting). The much smaller splitting within each branch is due to uniaxial strain alone, where symmetry breaking from uniaxial strain in monolayer graphene causes G-peaks to split into G+ and G- peaks. The same symmetry breaking causes R'-band splitting within each branch, whereas the branches themselves arise from changes in q1 and q2 vectors. Experimentally, at the strain values presented in the main text (< 0.2%), it is not possible to resolve either the G peak splitting from in the top layer from uniaxial strain alone, nor the individual peaks in the two R' branches. The calculated slopes presented in the main text are therefore the averaged blueshifting and redshifting R' peak shifts with applied uniaxial strain, similarly the Gtop peak shift slope presented is the average of the G+ and G- (E2g + and E2g - ) peak shifts with applied uniaxial strain (from 0.0% to 0.3%). Simulation and analysis of vibrational properties were conducted up to 0.5% strain, keeping our experimental results in frame. Nonetheless, our computational approach can be used to characterize these systems with a fine control over twist angle and strain."

To further elucidate the geometrical changes in moir\u00e9 superlattice, we denote the reciprocal lattice vectors of bottom graphene layer as b1 and b2 and for the rotated top layer as \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udfcf \u2032 and \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udfd0 \u2032 .

In unstrained configuration, the magnitude of q vectors is equal, i. e., |q1| = |q2|. The length of moir\u00e9 pattern (\u03bbm) can be derived using this value of q vector as \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5a = 4\ud835\udf0b\n\u221a3 |\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc56| . Now, when strain is applied to the top layer, its\nreciprocal lattice vector (\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc8a \ud835\udf3a) can be mathematically expressed as \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc8a \ud835\udf3a = (\ud835\udc70 + \ud835\udc7a)\u22121 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc8a \u2032 , where I is identity matrix and S denotes the strain tensor [15], which can be written as the following for uniaxial compression case, \ud835\udc7a = ( \u2212 \ud835\udf00 0\n0 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udf00 ). Here, \ud835\udf00 denotes the nominal strain and \ud835\udf08 denotes the\nPoisson's ratio. The reciprocal lattice vector of TBG with heterostrain can be written as \ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc8a \ud835\udf3a = \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc8a \ud835\udf3a \u2212 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc8a. Like unstrained condition, calculation of \ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc8a \ud835\udf3a magnitude shows us that |\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udf3a | \u2260 |\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udf3a |.

Hydrogen passivation was done along the free surface to obtain the most stable structure. The TBG structures are minimized using a conjugate gradient energy minimization method to have minimum energy configurations. A reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential was used for the intralayer covalent bonds28 and for the interlayer van der Waals interaction a registry dependent Kolmogorov-Crespi (KC) potential29 was selected. As TBG contains different local stacking configurations, an interatomic potential that considers registry different than equilibrium minimum energy stacking is needed3,30. Subsequently, we loaded the structure with constant incremental compressive strain to the top layer along zigzag direction. The uniaxial strain was incremented by -0.1% up to final strain of -1%.

            "text": "All monolayer graphene flakes are created by mechanically exfoliating from the bulk\ncrystal onto thoroughly cleaned 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates. The SiO2/Si substrates are placed into acetone then IPA baths for ~15 minutes each. After the solvent baths, the substrates are placed into a reactive ion etching (RIE) chamber, where a 100 W O2 plasma at 250 mtorr is used to treat the SiO2 surface for 3 minutes. The first set of graphene monolayers are created by directly exfoliating onto the SiO2 immediately after removing the substrates from the RIE chamber (< 1 minute), this is done to enhance the adhesion of the graphene monolayers to the SiO2 surface 32. The samples that are exfoliated directly after the RIE cleaning are termed the \u201cfixed\u201d graphene monolayers, proper adhesion is also confirmed by subjecting the samples to an IPA ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes. After waiting at least an hour after RIE cleaning, new graphene monolayers can be exfoliated that have less adhesion to the SiO2 substrate (termed as \u201cfree\u201d graphene) due to accumulated environmental adsorbates. For all exfoliation steps, the substrates are heated to 100\u00b0 C for 90 secs while the tape in contact, then the tape is removed after the substrates are cooled.\nAfter monolayers are optically identified along with the dominant exfoliation edge (zigzag)\nedges, the TBG is then constructed by stacking the \u201cfree\u201d graphene on top of the \u201cfixed\u201d graphene via a dry-transfer process. A PC/PDMS dome stamp is used to pick up the \u201cfree\u201d graphene first at ~120C, then the \u201cfixed\u201d graphene is placed underneath the stamp with the zigzag edges of both monolayers aligned. After edge alignment, the \u201cfixed\u201d graphene is rotated by the desired twist angle \u03b8, then the \u201cfree\u201d graphene layer is placed over the \u201cfixed\u201d graphene at ~100C with a speed maintained below 1 \u03bcm/s. The high adhesion at the \u201cfixed\u201d graphene\u2019s interface with the underlying SiO2 surface ensures that the \u201cfree\u201d graphene is removed from the PC/PDMS stamp, thus leaving a TBG/SiO2/Si structure behind without needing to melt the polymer. Differential interference contrast microscopy and atomic force microscopy are both used to confirm no bubbles are present in the samples. Raman spectroscopy is used to ensure the engineered angle was achieved by probing the R' (R) phonon frequency. High adhesion is the crux for this TBG fabrication; however, this level of adhesion is also necessary to avoid delamination issues after stressor deposition. The TBG fabrication details and adhesion characterization follow the procedures described in our previous work33.\nThe biaxially strained TBG samples are fully encapsulated with thermally evaporated\nstressors of CrOx (10 nm) / MgF2 (X nm), where tensile film force is adjusted by increasing the thickness of the MgF2 layer alone (40 nm to 125 nm). Tensile film force leads to compressive strain transfer into the top graphene layer. The CrOx layer is deposited on top of the MgF2 to preserve the stress state in this layer by isolating it from humidity34. The depositions begin at 5 \u00d7 10-6 torr, with deposition rates of 0.5-2 \u00c5/s for MgF2 and ~0.5-0.8 \u00c5/s for CrOx. We ensure that thermal evaporation does not induce any damage by probing monolayer samples for the graphene defect peak and confirm no detectable damage35. For the uniaxially strained TBG sample with the patterned stripe, we use a direct-write photolithography lift-off process with S1805 photoresist. The S1805 photoresist is spun at 4000 rpm for 45 seconds then baked at 100\u00b0C for 90 seconds before exposure. After exposure, the sample is placed in chlorobenzene for 300 seconds, developed in MF319 for 90 seconds, then rinsed with DI H2O. The stressor used for this sample is e-beam evaporated Al2O3 (10 nm) / MgF2 (75 nm) / Ti (5 nm). Similarly, the Al2O3 layer is used to preserve the stress state in the MgF2, while the Ti layer protects the graphene from potential damage of the\nsubsequently deposited layers36. We again confirm there are no defects from this process through Raman spectroscopy of the graphene defect peak. E-beam deposition also begins at 5 \u00d7 10-6 torr, where the deposition rates employed are 0.1-0.2 \u00c5/s for Ti, ~1.5 \u00c5/s for MgF2, and ~0.7 \u00c5/s for Al2O3."
