However, depending on the formalism used and the range of orbitals investigated, it may be hampered by a steep computational scaling. To alleviate this issue, correlated natural virtual orbitals (NVOs) based on second-order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset (MP2) and direct MP2 correlation energies are implemented, and the resulting correlated NVOs are tested on GW quasiparticle energies. Test cases include the popular GW variants G0W0 and evGW0 as well as more elaborate vertex corrections. We find that for increasingly larger molecular systems and basis sets, NVOs considerably improve efficiency. Furthermore, we test the performance of the truncated (frozen) NVO ansatz on the GW100 test set. For the latter, it is demonstrated that, using a carefully chosen truncation threshold, NVOs lead to a negligible loss in accuracy while providing speedups of one order of magnitude. Furthermore, we compare the resulting quasiparticle energies to very accurate vertical ionization energies obtained from coupled-cluster theory with singles, doubles, and noniterative triples [CCSD(T)], confirming that the loss in accuracy introduced by truncating the NVOs is negligible compared to the methodical errors in the GW approximation. It is also demonstrated that the choice of basis set impacts results far more than using a suitably truncated NVO space. Therefore, at the same computational expense, more accurate results can be obtained using NVOs. Finally, we provide improved reference CCSD(T) values for the GW100 test set, which have been obtained using the def2-QZVPP basis set. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\nCorrelated natural virtual orbitals (NVO)1 are an emerging class of orbitals that diagonalize a correlated density matrix spanning the full virtual orbital space. Most prominently, second-order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) has been used for the construction of the virtual part of the density matrix.2,3 Another viable alternative that can provide correlated density matrices at a rather low cost is the random-phase approximation (RPA).4 It has further been shown that using only a truncated subset of these MP2-based NVOs is a well-suited approach for obtaining correlation energies or properties from higher-order correlated methods, allowing for truncation of the space spanned by the virtual orbitals. MP2-based NVOs have since been applied to coupled-cluster (CC) theory with singles\u2013and\u2013doubles (CCSD),5 with perturbative triples\n[CCSD(T)],6\u201311 and in equation-of-motion-based CC (EOM-CC) and linear-response CC methods.12\u201314 Recently, MP2-based NVOs have also been applied to two- and four-component relativistic electron-correlation methods.15\nAnother interesting application for correlated NVOs is the GW approximation for molecules.16\u201318 In the GW approximation, the self-energy is calculated to correct a set of Kohn\u2013Sham (KS) orbital energies to yield quasiparticle energies. The latter are closely related to vertical ionization energies (VIEs). Obtaining the correlation part of the self-energy is however not a trivial task. Within the randomphase approximation, a naive ansatz scales as N6 with molecular size, which is roughly the same scaling behavior as CCSD. While certain techniques have been developed to lower this high computational effort,19\u201324 they are usually specific to a single variant of GW, namely, with the response calculated in the direct RPA approximation\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 144102 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0144469 158, 144102-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n09 January 2024 12:30:01\n(dRPA), neglecting all exchange terms. Furthermore, these approximations are often limited to only a few quasiparticle states, either drastically losing either efficiency or accuracy if full quasiparticle spectra are to be extracted. Also, specific vertex corrections are not accessible using these low-scaling GW variants. In many molecular applications, a GW calculation is only the beginning of a larger series of calculations, including follow-up calculations. Typical examples of follow-up calculations are simulations of optical excitation spectra using the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation,22,25\u201329 transport simulations,30\u201333 or computations of further molecular properties.34\u201336 When these types of calculations are performed a posteriori, it is questionable to only use partial quasiparticle spectra, and instead full ones are desirable. Therefore, the GW step is often the time-limiting step, especially if more than a few quasiparticle states are to be computed. Reducing the virtual expansion space can then significantly speed up the GW step, which has been recognized early as a viable path to obtaining fast yet reliable results. Previous techniques employed to reduce the virtual expansion space in GW, for example, focused on directly optimizing the virtual orbital space.37 In solid-state applications, attempts to reduce the expansion space in a GW calculations have also been applied successfully.38,39 A straightforward reduction of the virtual space is however connected to many caveats, as the GW self-energy generally converges only slowly with respect to the number of empty states. Therefore, truncation-based approaches are usually accompanied by extrapolation techniques or other error compensation approaches.37,38 Still, the convergence of truncated virtual spaces is still problematic.40,41 Like coupled-cluster theory, GW methods would see significant benefits from being able to truncate the virtual space drastically. In this study, we will demonstrate that correlated NVOs provide a convenient route toward truncating the virtual space. Viable paths to use truncated NVO spaces in GW calculations will be outlined, and the impact of certain truncation parameters will be discussed based on carefully assessed test sets."

Therefore, in Sec. II, all orbitals are assumed to be obtained from a converged KS calculation. While certainly there is a strong dependence of the GW results on the functional used to optimize the orbitals,42,43 in this study, we will show that the performance of NVOs is similar for all functional approximations."

            "text": "Natural orbitals in their most general form were introduced for the first time in 1955 by L\u00f6wdin as a set of molecular orbitals with the property of diagonalizing a one-electron density matrix.44 First defined only for occupied orbitals, it was shown that post-HF calculations using natural orbitals could be brought to convergence significantly faster than with canonical orbitals. As shown by David-\nson,1 natural orbitals minimize the least square error between the canonical density matrix and its truncated approximate\nf err. =\u2211 ab \u2223Dab \u2212 D\u0303ab\u2223. (1)\nTherefore, they provide an optimal expansion space for truncation, as they guarantee the overall lowest possible error in the matrix elements of the density matrix. The choice of the density matrix is here decisive for the efficiency of the natural orbitals in the desired post-HF method for which there are various proposals in the literature. The most common examples of natural orbitals are the pair (or pseudo) natural orbitals (PNOs),45\u201347 natural transition orbitals (NTOs),48 and MP2 natural orbitals.49,50 While NTOs are mainly used for the calculation of excited state properties,51 PNOs and MP2-NOs are primarily used for ground state calculations. Whereas PNOs are constructed for pairs of occupied HF orbitals, MP2-NOs are constructed from the total first-order wave function.\nTo obtain natural virtual orbitals (NVOs) at the MP2 level of theory, the construction of the virtual\u2013virtual block of the (RI-)MP2 density matrix49,50,52,53 is the most central step. This virtual\u2013virtual block is given by\nDMP2ab = 1 2\u2211ijc [(ai\u2223c j) \u2212 (ci\u2223a j)][(ib\u2223 jc) \u2212 (ic\u2223 jb)] (\u03b5i j \u2212 \u03b5ac)(\u03b5i j \u2212 \u03b5bc) , (2)\nwhere \u03b5pq = \u03b5p + \u03b5q denotes the sum of two orbital energies from two canonical spin-orbitals, and (pq\u2223rs) is a two-electron integral in Mulliken notation. We denote occupied spin-orbitals with the indices i, j, k, . . ., virtual spin-orbitals with a, b, c, . . ., and general spin-orbitals with p, q, r, . . .. Note that in our implementation, the computed occupation numbers (i.e., eigenvalues) refer to the spinorbital-based density matrix in Eq. (2) not only in the case of an unrestricted Hartree\u2013Fock (UHF) or Kohn\u2013Sham (UKS) reference determinant but also in the case of a restricted Hartree\u2013Fock (RHF) or Kohn\u2013Sham (RKS) reference determinant.\nThe NVOs are then obtained from the eigenvectors N of the virtual\u2013virtual density matrix DMP2 of Eq. (2). We keep all vectors N\u0303 with occupation numbers larger than some prescribed threshold. In the next step, we build semi-canonical NVOs by diagonalizing the Fock matrix in the truncated space. The essential steps for the determination of the semi-canonical NVOs, collected in the matrix C\u0303, are summarized in Table I. The orbital energies of the semi-canonical NVOs are the diagonal elements of the matrix \u03b5\u0303. The matrix C contains the original HF or KS virtual spin-orbitals.\nNote that the density matrix becomes block diagonal if the wave function is chosen to be an eigenfunction of the spin operator S\u0302z , as it is done in restricted or unrestricted HF/KS calculations. Then, the off-diagonal \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 blocks are zero, i.e., (D\u03b1\u03b2 = D\u03b2\u03b1 = 0). Accordingly, the density matrix can be diagonalized separately for the \u03b1\u2013\u03b1 and \u03b2\u2013\u03b2 blocks. The computational effort can be reduced even further in the closed-shell RHF/RKS case by exploiting the symmetry D\u03b1\u03b1 = D\u03b2\u03b2. Otherwise, steps (1)\u2013(5) must be carried out separately for the two spin cases. If the wave function is neither an eigenfunction of S\u0302z nor S\u0302 2, as it is the case when spin\u2013orbit effects are included, also the off-diagonal blocks must be included in the calculation of DMP2. In the latter case, the resulting complex NVOs are suitable to be applied in two- or four-component relativistic calculations, or calculations in external magnetic fields.22,54\u201357 Direct\nJ.

(2).58 Note that a prefactor of two has to be applied additionally in this case. Equation (2) also determines the overall scaling of the NVO generation step, scaling as N5. For dNVOs, the scaling can be reduced to N4 using Laplace transformations.59 While MP2 density matrices are a convenient choice in localized orbital simulations, they are less common in periodic frameworks. For the latter, density matrices based on the RPA may be better suited. Virtual\u2013virtual RPA density matrices, for example, occur in self-consistent RPA,60 and their calculation scales similar to Laplace-transformed direct MP2.61"

(12), as well as in the eigenvalue problem in Eq. (4). This transformation of W is crucial to all approaches if NVOs are to be used since the solution of the eigenvalue problem in Eq. (4) is associated with the greatest computational effort. Note that in Eq. (13), in addition to the charge fluctuation \u03c1m(x), also the energy eigenvalues \u03c9m in D\u00b1p,q,m must be replaced by the eigenvalues obtained from Eq. (4) using NVOs. If besides the screened interaction W also Green\u2019s function G is represented by NVOs, marked as variant 2 in Eq. (17), the whole correlation self-energy \u03a3c is computed in the NVO space. In this case, also the sum over all virtual orbitals \u03d5c(x) in the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (13) is replaced by NVOs as well as the corresponding orbital energies \u03b5c in D\u2212p,c,m. In the third variant, in addition to the self-energy, also the orbitals or spinors \u03d5p(x), for which the self-energy shall be computed, are transformed into a basis of natural virtual orbitals. This variant is relevant only if the considered orbital \u03d5p(x) in Eq. (13) denotes an unoccupied orbital \u03d5c(x) because, otherwise, it is equivalent with the second variant. While the first and second variants require the parallel use of two basis sets during the GW calculation, the third approach considerably simplifies the technicalities of implementing the approach. In the latter, the virtual canonical orbitals are simply replaced by the NVOs throughout all necessary steps. However, the eigenvalues of the NVOs are considerably worse approximations of the quasiparticle energies, and therefore we mainly opt to use NVOs to evaluate Eqs. (4) and (12), that is, variant 1. The remaining terms in the correlation self-energy given in Eq. (13) are obtained using the canonical KS orbitals. Variant 1 is generally also compatible with self-consistent variants as for example, evGW0, during which G is updated but W is kept at its initial state. Introducing\nself-consistency in W through full eigenvalue self-consistent GW (evGW) is however troublesome using NVOs. Starting from the second iteration, the eigenvalues used in the construction of W are no longer the NVO eigenvalues, but the evGW ones, which are, in general, not compatible with the NVO eigenfunctions. This leads to significant errors in the unoccupied quasiparticle states. Due to the iterative nature, the errors in the unoccupied quasiparticle states subsequently also disturb the occupied quasiparticle states. Quasiparticle self-consistent GW (qsGW)65 is currently beyond the scope of this work, as it would require to also update the NVOs during the iterative process. We note in passing that, contrary to evGW, the use of NVO for qsGW is nevertheless well-defined, as long as they are updated in each iteration. From a methodical scaling point of view, classical GW variants scale as N6 with system size. Therefore, using NVOs pays off given that they can be determined with at most N5 cost. For low-scaling GW algorithms, scaling as N4 or better, NVO is less rewarding. Nevertheless, the possibility of applying low-scaling GW algorithms is mostly limited to direct RPA response, while NVOs in combination with Eqs. (4) and (13) are generally applicable. We further note that the construction of the (d)MP2 density matrix can be made local, reducing its effective scaling drastically.66\nD. Vertex corrections Vertex corrections are the next step on the GW hierarchy of methods, surpassing the simple approach of using solely Coulomb interactions from the direct random-phase approximation.67\u201370 Unfortunately, calculating vertex corrections is computationally demanding, yielding rather complicated expressions. While it is yet to be determined if vertex corrections improve VIEs obtained from the GW method,71 current investigations of transition-metal monoxides have revealed some importance for certain molecular systems.72 The high costs of calculating vertex corrections, however, severely hamper further investigations, being unfeasible for molecular systems of chemically relevant size. As NVOs provide a convenient route to reducing the cost of obtaining vertex corrections, we will expand our discussion by including NVOs in their computation.\nIn Ref. 68, Gr\u00fcneis et al. use ordered second-order diagrams to obtain the vertex correction \u0394\u03b5p(\u03c9) as\n\u0394\u03b5p(\u03c9) =\u2211 i,a,b\n(ia\u2223W\u2223pb)(ib\u2223W\u2223pa)\u2217\n\u03b5a + \u03b5b \u2212 \u03b5i \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212\u2211 i, j,a\n(ia\u2223W\u2223 jp)(ip\u2223W\u2223 ja)\u2217\n\u03b5a + \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5 j .\n(18)\nW in Eq. (18) refers to the full static screened interaction as described in Eq. (9), where \u03c9 = 0 is set. The latter choice is termed test-charge\u2013test-charge (TC\u2013TC) interaction, and labeled WTC\u2013TC in Ref. 68. Evaluating Eq. (18) scales as N6, providing a steep increase in computational demands for GW. Using the resolution-of-theidentity approximation for the construction of WTC\u2013TC can reduce this to N5,22 and accordingly using NVOs can further accelerate the construction of vertex corrections. In our current implementation, we use NVOs for all orbital functionals as well as in the construction of WTC\u2013TC, yielding an efficient way to calculate vertex corrections.\nJ. Chem.

To test the performance of NVOs within the GW method, VIEs are obtained with NVOs using the linearized G0W0 and the evGW0 approaches. As reference VIE values, the canonical results (obtained using canonical orbitals), will be used. This allows us to assess the deviations caused directly by truncating the NVO space. Furthermore, we compare the obtained VIE values, with and without using truncating the NVO space, to accurate CCSD(T) reference values. GW-based VIEs will be evaluated for three density-functional approximations (DFAs), namely, the global hybrid PBE0,75 the range-separated hybrid wB97XD,76 and the local hybrid TMHF.77 Hybrid functionals, especially range-separated and local hybrid functionals, have earlier shown to yield excellent results for VIEs in combination with the G0W0 method.42,43 This will allow one to conclude the transferability of NVOs between different reference functionals. All DFT calculations were tightly converged, with energy and density-matrix thresholds being set to 10\u22129 Eh and 10\u22128, respectively. Fine integration grids of size 4 or better were used to obtain fully converged results for all tested molecules and functionals.78 To determine the dependence of the NVO approximation on a given basis-set expansion, all G0W0 and evGW0 computations were carried out using the triple\u03b6 def2-TZVPP basis set.79 Additionally, for an initial investigation, the G0W0 computations were also performed using the quadruple-\u03b6 def2-QZVPP basis sets.79 All DFT, NVO, and GW calculations were performed using a locally modified development version of TURBOMOLE 7.7.73 The resolution-of-the-identity approximation has been used in all NVO and GW calculations, and the corresponding def2-TZVPP and def2-QZVPP auxiliary basis sets optimized for post-HF calculations (denoted as cbas in TURBOMOLE jargon), were used.80 See Ref. 80 and references therein for a detailed description of the auxiliary basis sets.\nFor the GW100 test set,81 we compare the computed VIEs obtained as GW quasiparticle energies with reference data obtained at the coupled-cluster level, including single and double substitutions as well as a perturbative correction for connected triple substitutions, that is, at the CCSD(T) level. The CCSD(T) reference values have been carefully re-assessed, and changes and new values are outlined in Sec. IV. All EOMIP-CCSD and EOMIP-CCSDT calculations have been performed using the CFOUR program.82 All of our primary reference data [geometries, UHF/def2-TZVPP, UHF/def2QZVPP, CCSD(T)/def2-TZVPP, and CCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP energies, number of orbitals excluded from the correlation treatment] are published as supplementary data in the supplementary material."

            "text": "The CCSD(T)/def2-TZVPP reference data have already been published in an earlier work,83 and in the present paper, we specifically report revised data for four molecules of the test set. Furthermore, CCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP reference data for the GW100 test set have been computed, and a full overview of the calculated VIEs is provided in the supplementary material. In our previous work,83 the\nCCSD(T) computations were based on unrestricted Hartree\u2013Fock (UHF) reference determinants, both for the cationic and neutral systems, and for all systems, we had attempted to find the UHF solution with the lowest energy. Recently, Bruneval, Dattani, and van Setten (BDvS) have repeated our CCSD(T)/def2-TZVPP calculations using a restricted Hartree\u2013Fock (RHF) reference determinant for the neutral systems instead.84 In the course of the latter work, BDvS found UHF solutions with lower energy for the cations of uracil (CAS Reg. No. 66-22.8), cytosine (71-30-7), and hydrogen cyanide (74-90-8). We have adopted these solutions in our present work. Furthermore, BDvS pointed out in their work that our previously reported value for carbonyl selenide (1603-84-5, OCSe) had erroneously been computed for carbonyl sulfide (in the OCSe geometry). In the present work, we report the correct values for the carbonyl selenide molecule.\nAfter the above revisions, only two clear outliers remain when comparing our CCSD(T)/def2-TZVPP data with the data of BDvS. These outliers are sulfur dioxide (7446-09-5, SO2) and magnesium oxide (1309-48-4, MgO), which will be discussed below. Excluding SO2 and MgO from the comparison, the mean deviation of our values from those of BDvS amounts to 0.003 eV. The mean absolute deviation is 0.02 eV, and the sample standard deviation is 0.05 eV (note that data for the cesium dimer are missing from DBvS\u2019s supplementary data, such that the comparison is made for 97 molecules).\nThe problem with SO2 is that we use the lowest-energy UHF solution for the SO+2 cation, which amounts to \u2212546.881 967 Eh, whereas BDvS use the solution with EUHF = \u2212546.861 914 Eh. Admittedly, our lowest-energy solution is heavily spincontaminated (\u27e8S\u0302 2\u27e9 = 1.13 h\u03352) and the corresponding CCSD(T) energy does not seem accurate. The CCSD(T) energy obtained with BDvS\u2019s UHF solution is much closer to the CCSD(T) energy obtained with a restricted open-shell Hartree\u2013Fock (ROHF) reference determinant for SO+2 (Table II). Also the EOMIP-CCSD (equation-of-motion-ionization-potential coupled-cluster-singlesand-doubles) value85 favors BDvS\u2019s CCSD(T) result.\nThe problem with MgO is that we use the lowest-energy UHF solution for the neutral molecule, whereas BDvS use the closedshell restricted Hartree\u2013Fock (RHF) solution (Table III). Also in this case, the EOMIP-CCSD value of 8.172 eV for the VIE favors BDvS\u2019s CCSD(T) result (7.909 eV). We acknowledge that our value (7.487 eV) is very likely to be too small by about 0.4 eV and suggest using the EOMIP-CCSDT (EOMIP-CCSD-and-triples) values for the molecules SO2 and MgO instead. Those VIE values amount to 12.225 and 7.877 eV for SO2 and MgO, respectively, as computed by the CFOUR program.82 In the def2-QZVPP basis set, the corresponding EOMIP-CCSDT values are 12.403 and 7.939 eV, respectively (cf supplementary material)."

First, it is visible that simply truncating the space spanned by the canonical orbitals in GW calculations is not a viable choice. The convergence toward the canonical result is slow, with any practically useable truncation parameter leading to unacceptable errors. Even including 80%\u201390% of the canonical orbitals does not yield converged results. Contrary, very good results are obtained if NVOs are used to calculate the self-energy \u03a3. In Fig. 1, NVOs are employed to evaluate Eqs. (4) and (12), consistent with variant 1 outlined in Sec. II A. Converged results are obtained if 30%\u201340% of the total number of virtual orbitals are included. Before this point, the error curve is less steep and the overall deviation therefore already largely reduced. This effect gets more prominent as more virtual orbitals are discarded. Note that the basis set size does not seem to be too important. The def2-QZVPP basis set shows deviations similar to those of the def2-TZVPP basis set, with the latter showing slightly reduced deviations in the case of a very low number of virtual orbitals taken into account.\nNext, we will analyze the deviation introduced by NVOs dependent on the system size and the cardinality of the correlationconsistent basis set used.86,87 Therefore, the deviations of the VIEs in the acene series from benzene to hexacenes are shown in Fig. 2 for a 50% truncated virtual space. Furthermore, Fig. 2 also shows the deviations obtained for benzene with increasing basis set size.\nFigure 2 exhibits that the deviation of the VIE normalized to \u03a3C obtained in the fully intact virtual space decreases with the system size. The latter effect is to be expected as the virtual expansion size linearly increases in the row, providing more flexible combinations from which the NVOs can be generated. Moreover, Fig. 2 outlines how the deviation of the VIEs converges with an increasing number of basis functions for the benzene molecule. Again, raising the cardinal number of the basis set (adding a considerable amount of basis functions) provides a more flexible basis from which the NVOs can be generated. Discarding half of the virtual orbitals in each case therefore still leads to an increasingly efficient description of the\nvirtual space by the NVOs, significantly increasing the accuracy of NVO calculations. Overall, Fig. 2 points out at large molecules combined with large basis sets being a primary target for NVOs, with the latter working exceptionally well in these cases.\nTable IV outlines the timings needed to build NVOs from scratch for the acenes shown in Fig. 2. Even on moderate computational resources, building NVOs for systems with up to 1000\u20131500 Cartesian basis functions (BFs) only takes seconds to a few minutes. Compared to classical N6 scaling GW calculations, this is a vanishing\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 144102 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0144469 158, 144102-6\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\neffort. Still, for extensive systems, the overall N4\u2013N5 effort needed to construct canonical NVOs will be significant once 2000\u20133000 BF are surpassed. In this case, local methods to construct the (d)MP2 density matrix need to be employed to reduce the overall scaling in the NVO construction.\nB. Ionization energies using NVOs for the GW100 test set\nTo analyze the overall deviation stemming from truncating the virtual orbitals space, we determine the error in the quasiparticle energies for the GW100 test set using various settings that determine how many virtual orbitals are neglected (frozen). Figures 3 and 4 outline a more detailed statistical analysis of the usage of NVOs in the GW100 test set for the def2-TZVPP and def2-QZVPP basis sets, respectively. Both plots show the obtained deviations for a 50% reduced virtual space and for three different occupation number thresholds that have been used to choose NVOs of lesser importance. Box plots were used to give a compact representation of the data distribution with respect to the full virtual orbital space. The horizontal orange line indicates the median and the upper and lower limits of the box (upper and lower quartiles) indicate that 25% of the data values are located above and below the quartile. The range of the box is the interquartile range (IQR). The whiskers extend to the data with values less than 1.5 times the interquartile range plus the lower or upper quartile.\nFirst, comparing Figs. 3 and 4 suggests that a required occupation number threshold is dependent on the basis set size. For\nexample, for the def2-TZVPP basis set, a threshold of less than 10\u22124 below which NVOs are discarded leads to basically converged results. Contrary, the def2-QZVPP basis set requires a threshold of less than 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 to reduce the deviations found for the VIEs to a similar accuracy. For comparison, Figs. 3 and 4 also outline results with truncated canonical orbital spaces, where the number of active virtual orbitals has been chosen to match those of the NVOs. Figures 3 and 4 confirm the initial assumption that truncating canonical orbitals is a rather error-prone approach. For any truncation threshold, truncating canonical virtual orbitals yields a broad error distribution, being unsuitable to obtain quasiparticle energies. While truncating the NVO space is superior to truncating canonical virtual orbitals, both plots exhibit that the exact means of the generation of the NVOs are not too important. Quasiparticle energies obtained from NVOs generated from a direct-MP2 density matrix (dNVOs) are practically indistinguishable from their standard counterparts. Especially for larger molecules, where highperformance algorithms for Laplace-transformed direct MP2 have been developed,58,59 this can be translated in considerable gains while practically no accuracy is lost. Concerning the choice of the density functional approximation, no dependence of the NVOs on the underlying functional can be observed. Figure 5 depicts the fraction of the discarded virtual orbitals in dependence on the occupation number thresholds used in Figs. 3 and 4.\nAs outlined by Fig. 5, the tighter truncation thresholds for def2QZVPP still lead to a higher relative number of NVOs that are discarded, translating into more pronounced speedups. To further check for the validity of NVOs in GW calculation, we also investigate the behavior in the evGW0 method. In this method, specifically, the screened exchange W is kept at the KS level. Accordingly, W can be calculated using the NVOs obtained from the KS reference, and we update only the Greens function in every iteration.88 Deviations found for the evGW0 method, shown in Fig. 6, are in principle identical to the previously observed deviations for the G0W0 approximation. The same conclusions drawn before for the truncated virtual spaces and difference density functional approximations therefore also apply to evGW0. Using (d)NVOs can therefore help to considerably accelerate evGW0. Notably, Fig. 6 shows that there is a single outlier for the smaller thresholds. This outlier is in every case helium, which reacts very sensitively to the omission of any orbitals in the GW treatment. For atomic cases, especially for helium, NVOs should therefore not be used.\nFigure 7 depicts the statistical errors obtained for the VIE of the energetically lowest occupied orbital. This orbital corresponds to the 1s orbital when no effective core potential (ECP) is used, and to the first orbital not included in the ECP otherwise. For these vertical core ionization energies, a generally amplified magnitude of errors is observed. The latter is caused by the significantly raised ionization energies needed to expel core or non-valence electrons. Non-valence electron VIEs exhibit an increased sensitivity to the chosen occupation number threshold, with only the tighter thresholds yielding acceptable results. Notably, using canonical orbitals, the VIEs of these orbitals are strongly overestimated. In contrast, as outlined in Figs. 4\u20136, valence electron VIEs are strongly underestimated with truncated canonical orbitals. The exceedingly large error of VIEs when frozen canonical orbitals are used, reaching up to 10\u201320 eV, basically renders this approach useless for core ionization energies. Using NVOs, these errors can be largely reduced. The\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 144102 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0144469 158, 144102-7\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n09 January 2024 12:30:01\nFIG. 3.

The damping parameter \u03b7 = 0.001 was used.\noverall accuracy with frozen NVOs is then again comparable to the overall accuracy that can be reached with GW methods while speeding up the calculation by an order of magnitude or more. Notably, the outliers in Fig. 7 can be grouped into two classes. The first class is constituted by elements where ECPs have been employed, as e.g., I2. The second class is built by elements with 1s VIEs exceeding 10 000 eV, for example, Br2 or GeH4. For orbitals close to an effective\ncore potential, using truncated NVOs is therefore not recommendable. For the second class, while larger than usual absolute errors are obtained, the relative error, which is also connected to the overall accuracy of GW, is very good. The presented approach can therefore also be recommended for core ionization energies.\nFinally, the question remains of how much the VIEs are impacted at all by the use of a truncated set of virtual orbitals.\nJ.

(Bottom) def2-QZVPP basis, corresponding IPs are found in Fig. 4.\nFigure 8 compares the VIEs obtained from CCSD(T)/def2-TZVPP, G0W0@DFT/def2-TZVPP, and G0W0@DFT/def2-QZVPP to the reference VIEs obtained from CCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP.\nIn Fig. 8, it is visible that NVOs are not lowering the overall accuracy of the G0W0 method when compared to the results using the full virtual space. The overall error when compared to CCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP reference values is hardly affected at all, with the NVO/def2-TZVPP combination even exhibiting a slightly improved performance compared to a full virtual space. The latter effect can however safely be attributed to error cancellation. It is therefore important to point out two things. First, using NVOs one could accelerate a calculation using the same basis set, without a significant loss in accuracy. Second, using a truncated NVO space, quadruple-\u03b6 results can be obtained basically at triple-\u03b6 cost or less. As shown in Fig. 8, the accuracy improvement of going from triple-\u03b6 to quadruple-\u03b6 far outperforms any error introduced by the NVOs. Contrary, truncating the canonical orbital space significantly deteriorates the obtained VIEs. Figure 8 estimates that the average errors are 2\u20133 times larger in the latter case. Note that even CCSD(T), when used with a smaller basis set, is considerably in error. Deviations of up to 0.25 eV are found for the latter\nbasis set when compared to the reference values, with a mean error of \u223c0.1 eV.\nC. Vertex corrections Subsequently, to standard G0W0 and evGW0 calculations, NVOs are especially interesting to speed up the calculation of otherwise rather expensive higher-order vertex corrections to the G0W0 or evGW0 quasiparticle energies. Using NVOs, the virtual space can be truncated, which leads to large gains when evaluating Eq. (18). Especially the evaluation of the first term in Eq. (18), featuring a sum over two virtual indices, will benefit from truncating the virtual space. Of course, the question of how much NVOs will affect the results remains. It turns out that for vertex corrections the deviation introduced by using NVOs is again reduced quickly and smoothly with the occupation number threshold as outlined in Fig. 9.\nGiven that the magnitude of the vertex corrections \u0394\u03b5p is usually much smaller than the initial correlation self-energy obtained from G0W0 or evGW0, smaller deviations are obtained overall. Still, truncating the virtual space while using canonical orbitals leads to\nJ. Chem.

In the latter case, the incorporated error is of the same order of magnitude as the vertex corrections itself, yielding unacceptable deviations. Contrary, truncating the virtual space is possible without sacrificing much accuracy when NVOs are used. With NVOs the error is well under control, especially for lower occupation numbers. An occupation number threshold of 10\u22124 again seems to provide a reasonable balance between performance and accuracy, with the mean error on the vertex correction approaching 0.01\u20130.02 eV. The error distribution for vertex corrections is\ntherefore in line with that of the quasiparticle energies themselves. Using the same thresholds for both, vertex corrections and quasiparticle energies, is therefore possible and advisable, yielding a consistent yet efficient and accurate method. As a final remark, it is interesting to note that for the lowest occupation number thresholds of 5 \u00d710\u22125 and 10\u22124, the single largest outlier exhibiting double the error of the second largest one is again helium. The latter already showed to be troublesome for evGW0 and is, in general, known to be a challenging case for GW methods.89 We, however, note that this is\nJ. Chem.

            "text": "We have outlined the principal capabilities of using the truncated natural virtual orbital spaces to accelerate the evaluation of quasiparticle energies from the GW approximation. For VIEs, we find that the NVO space can be considerably truncated without a significant loss in accuracy in the quasiparticle energies obtained from either G0W0 or evGW0. The truncation thresholds used to construct a set of NVOs are furthermore shown to be transferable between different classes of density functional approximations. However, it is not automatically transferable between basis sets, and most likely an optimal value needs to be determined for at least\nevery cardinal number of orbital basis sets. We recommend truncating the space spanned by the NVOs by neglecting orbitals with occupation numbers of less than 10\u22124 for triple-\u03b6 basis sets, and a slightly tighter threshold of 5 \u00d710\u22125 for quadruple-\u03b6 basis sets. Using these thresholds leads to tightly converged quasiparticle energies, and also to tightly converged vertex corrections. The remaining error of using NVOs has then been shown to be insignificant compared to the overall error of the GW method. This also holds for non-valence orbitals, for example, 1s orbitals of lighter elements. For the latter, NVOs yield excellent quasiparticle energies, while largely reducing the cost of the associated GW calculation. It is furthermore interesting to note that the exact way the correlated NVOs are obtained is not too important. NVOs obtained from direct MP2 lead to practically indistinguishable result, while speeding up the process by an order of magnitude. For periodic GW calculations, where MP2 density matrices are not commonly available, one could resort to RPA density matrices, which have similar properties and are expected to work as well as dMP2 density matrices for NVO generation due to their principal similarity. Given the robustness of the NVO scheme, exhibiting no significant difference between MP2 and dMP2 density matrices, we also expect RPA density matrices to provide results of similar quality. These results are especially encouraging for vertex corrections, which are generally considered to be computationally demanding. The latter can be accelerated using NVOs to yield methods that are routinely applicable to molecular systems, allowing future investigations to take them into account when needed.\nFor electron attachment energies (not reported here), we find NVOs to be not suitable within the GW ansatz when the full virtual space is replaced by NVOs. The failure can be attributed to the fact that the virtual eigenvalues of the Fock matrix in the truncated space of the NVOs should not be used as starting points for the computation of the respective quasiparticle energies. The problem can be remedied by not replacing those virtual orbitals that are relevant for the electron attachment energies by NVOs. This must also be taken into account when computing excitation energies through the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation, in which quasiparticle energies of occupied and virtual levels are used as input."
