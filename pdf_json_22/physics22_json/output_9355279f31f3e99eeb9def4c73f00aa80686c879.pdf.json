    "abstractText": "An interferometric arrangement is proposed in which the technique of weak value amplification is implemented in order to enlarge the effect of a single photon on the quadratures of a movable mirror of an optical cavity. The photon interacts weakly with the mirror via radiation pressure and is postselected in the dark port of the interferometer. The real and imaginary parts of weak values of angular momentum type photonic operators produce an amplification of the mirror quadratures, which is large as compared to the scenario in which all photons are taken into consideration, i.e. when no postselection is performed. The effect is studied both for a mirror initialized in a thermal and coherent states. For a thermal state, the weak value amplification effect is boosted with the number of particles of the mirror, which occurs due to the imaginary part of the weak values.",

Inside the cavity, the photon and the mirror interact via radiation\npressure [1, 2, 3] which produces optomechanical entanglement [4]. Outside the cavity,\nthe emitted photon is detected in the dark port of an interferometric arrangement,\nthat selects a certain photonic pure state. This is a probabilistic procedure called\npostselection [5], that may fail or be successful. In the latter case a final state of the\nphoton is also specified, besides the initial state (both states are thereby known). We\nwill study the change of the quadratures of the mirror after the interaction, conditioning\non the events for which the postselection was successful. Since the interaction between\nthe mirror and the photon is weak, the change of the mechanical quadratures will depend\non weak values of the photonic operators that take part in the interaction.\nThe weak value of an observable is a complex value that shows up in a weak\nmeasurement of the observable followed by postselection [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The magnitude\nof the weak value can lie outside the eigenvalue range, in which case it is said to\nbe anomalous. An anomalous weak value will have therefore a larger effect on the\nmeasurement device as compared to a standard measurement, in which case the pointer\nvariable of the apparatus is displaced by a quantity within the eigenvalue range. The\nincreased effect of the system on the measurement device due to anomalous weak\nvalues will be referred as the weak value amplification effect. Weak values are objects\ninteresting on their own [11, 12, 13], that have been used to study counterfactual\nparadoxes [14, 15, 16, 17], wave-particle duality [18, 19] and are related to contextuality\n[20]. They have applications in quantum state reconstruction [21, 22, 23] and metrology\n[24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In metrological applications, although the measurement precision\ndoes not improve with the use of weak values, it is possible the reach the same level\nof precision with fewer data (since postselection reduces the size of the data set)\n[30, 31, 32, 33]. Consequently, the effect of weak values in the radiation pressure\ninteraction may be useful for the estimation of optomechanical parameters. Additionally,\nweak values have been considered as a quantum effect [34, 35], which makes interesting\ntheir application in mesoscopic systems [36].\nThe structure of this article is as follows. In section 2 we review the weak\nvalue amplification effect. Our treatment, however, considers a different interaction\nhamiltonian between the system and the measurement device, as compared to the\nstandard hamiltonian presented in most literature on the subject. In section 3 we\nshow how the previous effect may be applied to the interaction between a single photon\nand the moving mirror of an optical cavity. In section 4 our results are presented for a\nmirror initialized in a thermal and coherent states. Finally, in section 5 the results are\ncommented and summarized."

The initial quantum states of the MD and the system are denoted as\n\u03c1M and \u03c1S, respectively, while the initial joint state of the system and the MD is the product (uncorrelated) state \u03c1S,M = \u03c1S \u2297 \u03c1M . Expectation values on these initial states will be denoted as \u3008M\u0302\u3009 \u2261 Tr(M\u0302\u03c1M) and \u3008S\u0302\u3009 \u2261 Tr(M\u0302\u03c1S), where M\u0302 and S\u0302 are hermitian operators of the MD and the system, respectively. The interaction between the system\nand the MD is described by the hamiltonian\nH\u0302int = g\u03b4(t)(J\u0302xY\u0302 + J\u0302yX\u0302), (1)\nwhere Jx, Jy are angular momentum operators of the system, and X\u0302, Y\u0302 are the quadratures of the MD, which satisfy [X\u0302, Y\u0302 ] = i. The function \u03b4(t) is a Dirac delta\nfunction and g is a real parameter representing the coupling strength between the system\nand the MD. It is worth to point out that this hamiltonian differs from the interaction\nhamiltonian of a measurement, since the latter corresponds to the product of a system\nvariable (the measured observable) and an apparatus variable, a model often referred\nas the von Neumann hamiltonian [7, 37]. When the free evolution of the MD and the\nsystem can be neglected, the interaction hamiltonian generates the evolution operator\nU\u0302 = exp [\u2212ig(J\u0302xY\u0302 + J\u0302yX\u0302)]. (2)\nLet R\u0302 = S\u0302\u2297 M\u0302 be a joint observable of the system and the MD. The expectation value of R\u0302 on the state after the interaction is \u3008R\u0302\u3009f \u2261 Tr(R\u0302U\u0302\u03c1S,M U\u0302 \u2020) = Tr(U\u0302 \u2020R\u0302U\u0302\u03c1S,M). The transformation U\u0302 \u2020R\u0302U\u0302 can be expanded in powers of g using the well known operator\nexpansion [38],\nU\u0302 \u2020R\u0302U\u0302 = R\u0302 + ig[J\u0302xY\u0302 + J\u0302yX\u0302, R\u0302] + (ig)2\n2!

(6)\nThis result corresponds to the probability to read the outcome \u201c1\u201d in a strong\nmeasurement of the projector, i.e. if the system and the MD interact weakly via the\nhamiltonian (1) and then we measure strongly the projector P\u0302\u03c6, the probability to read the eigenvalue 1 will be given by this expression. This probability is also called the probability to postselect the state |\u03c6\u3009 after the weak interaction between the MD and the system. Notice that, when the expectation values of the commutators vanish, then the probability simply corresponds to \u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009, i.e. to the probability to project the initial state into the final state |\u03c6\u3009. Note also that the approximation (6) assumes that \u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009 is larger than the higher order terms of the expansion, and thereby can not be arbitrarily\nsmall. Suppose now that we perform a measurement of R\u0302 = P\u0302\u03c6 \u2297 M\u0302 and ask for the expectation value of M\u0302 conditioned to the cases in which the system state |\u03c6\u3009 was successfully postselected. The conditioned expectation value E(M\u0302 |f) corresponds to the ratio \u3008P\u0302\u03c6M\u0302\u3009f/\u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009f , where the numerator can be evaluated using (4) while the denominator corresponds to (6).

This expression constitutes a direct application of equation (17) of [39] to\na hamiltonian of the type (1). It shows that the change of M\u0302 depends both on the\ncommutators and anticommutators between the system variables (J\u0302x, J\u0302y and P\u0302\u03c6), which are normalized by \u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009. Therefore, the change may be larger than the one described by\n(5). When the initial system state is pure, i.e. \u03c1S = |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c8|, these terms are related to the real and imaginary parts of weak values,\n<(Jx,w) = \u3008{J\u0302x, P\u0302\u03c6}\u3009\n2\u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009 , =(Jx,w) = \u2212 \u3008[J\u0302x, P\u0302\u03c6]\u3009 2i\u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009 , (8)\n<(Jy,w) = \u3008{J\u0302y, P\u0302\u03c6}\u3009\n2\u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009 , =(Jy,w) = \u2212 \u3008[J\u0302y, P\u0302\u03c6]\u3009 2i\u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009 , (9)\nwhere <(?) and =(?) denote the real and imaginary parts of ?, while the complex values Jx,w and Jy,w correspond to the weak values of J\u0302x and J\u0302y, respectively, which are defined as\nJx,w = \u3008\u03c6| J\u0302x |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c6|\u03c8\u3009 , Jy,w = \u3008\u03c6| J\u0302y |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c6|\u03c8\u3009 . (10)\nThe shift of M\u0302 depends therefore on both weak values, which may be larger than the\nexpectation values appearing in (5). In order to amplify the change of M\u0302 it is useful\nto chose quasi orthogonal initial and final states. However, there is a limit to the\namplification with weak values: the zero and first order terms of (4) and (6) should\ndominate over the higher order terms of the expansion."

            "text": "In this section we show how the previous results can be applied to an optomechanical\nsystem (OMS). The OMS corresponds to an optical Fabry Pe\u0301rot cavity with one movable\nmirror. The center of mass of the mirror is described as a single mode quantum harmonic\noscillator of frequency \u2126. The cavity mode is coupled to an infinite collection of external\nmodes, as it is depicted in figure 1. The hamiltonian H\u0302 that describes the dynamics of\nthe whole system (the OMS coupled to the external modes) is given by\nH\u0302 = H\u0302OMS + H\u0302f + H\u0302dis, H\u0302OMS = \u03c9cava\u0302 \u2020a\u0302+ \u2126c\u0302\u2020c\u0302\u2212 g0a\u0302\u2020a\u0302(c\u0302\u2020 + c\u0302),\nH\u0302f = \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9\u03c9b\u0302\u2020\u03c9 b\u0302\u03c9,\nH\u0302dis =\n\u221a \u0393\n2\u03c0\n( a\u0302 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9b\u0302\u2020\u03c9 + a\u0302 \u2020 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9b\u0302\u03c9 ) . (11)\nThe first contribution, H\u0302OMS, describes the OMS. The cavity and mechanical mode operators are a\u0302 and c\u0302, respectively. The frequency of the cavity mode is denoted as\n\u03c9cav. The parameter g0 is the vacuum optomechanical coupling strength, that quantifies the strength of the radiation pressure interaction between a single cavity mode and the\nmoving mirror. The second contribution, H\u0302f , is the free energy of the external modes. The third term, H\u0302dis, describes the coupling between the external field and the cavity mode, where \u0393 is the decay rate of the cavity field through the fixed mirror.\nWe will assume that the initial state of the external field is a (pure) single photon\nstate,\n|\u03c8\u3009S = \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9G(\u03c9;\u03c90, )b\u0302 \u2020 \u03c9 |\u2205\u3009S , G(\u03c9;\u03c90, ) = \u221a \u03c0\n1\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 + i , (12)\nwhere |G(\u03c9;\u03c90, )|2 is a Lorentzian spectral distribution. The parameter \u03c90 is the median of the distribution and is the half-width at half-maximum of the spectrum (a measure of the width of the distribution). The state |\u2205\u3009S is the multimode vacuum state. If the moving mirror starts in a number state |n\u3009M and the cavity is initially empty |0\u3009cav, the Schro\u0308dinger equation can be solved analytically. In an interaction picture with respect to \u2126c\u0302\u2020c\u0302+ H\u0302f , the evolution of the external field and the OMS corresponds to\n|n\u3009M |\u03c8\u3009S \u2192 |n\u3009M |\u03c8\u3009S \u2212 \u221a 2gJ\u0302+ |\u03c8\u3009S c\u0302 |n\u3009M + \u221a 2gJ\u0302\u2212 |\u03c8\u3009S c\u0302 \u2020 |n\u3009M . (13)\nThe operators J\u0302+, J\u0302\u2212 are ladder (angular momentum type) operators that will create single photons states with a shifted frequency spectrum. We will describe them below,\nbut previously let us comment on different aspects regarding the process described by\nequation (13). In the first place, note that the probabilities to excite the oscillator to the state |n+ 1\u3009M , or to produce a transition to |n\u2212 1\u3009M , are proportional to g2, where g \u2261 g0/\u2126 is a small scaled optomechanical parameter. Therefore, the initial states will be barely perturbed. Secondly, notice that cavity states do not appear in expression\n(13). This occurs because the cavity begins and ends in the vacuum state, and therefore\nit its not necessary to include it explicitly. In the third place, and as it is explained in\ndetail in Appendix A, the process described by (13) is valid under different conditions,\nwhich are; a) the OMS should operate in the resolved side band regime (\u2126 \u0393), b) the radiation pressure interaction should be weak (g2n 1), c) the photon should have a small detuning with respect to the cavity frequency, i.e. \u03c90 = \u03c9cav + \u03b4, where the detuning is \u03b4 \u2261 \u2212g20/\u2126, and d) be nearly monochromatic ( \u0393), and e) the interaction should last for long times (t \u22121). Now, let us turn into the definition of\nJ\u0302+, J\u0302\u2212, considering the following boson creation operators b\u0302\u2020\u22121 \u2261 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9G(\u03c9;\u03c90 \u2212 \u2126, )b\u0302\u2020\u03c9, b\u0302 \u2020 0 \u2261 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9G(\u03c9;\u03c90, )b\u0302 \u2020 \u03c9,\nb\u0302\u20201 \u2261 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9G(\u03c9;\u03c90 + \u2126, )b\u0302 \u2020 \u03c9.\n(14)\nIt is easy to note that |\u03c8\u3009S = b\u0302 \u2020 0 |\u2205\u3009S, and |d\u3009S \u2261 b\u0302 \u2020 \u22121 |\u2205\u3009S is a single photon state with the frequency spectrum \u201cshifted to the left\u201d by \u2126, while |u\u3009S \u2261 b\u0302 \u2020 1 |\u2205\u3009S is a single photon state with the frequency spectrum \u201cshifted to the right\u201d by \u2126. Since there is no frequency overlap between the states, it is clear that \u3008\u03c8|S|u\u3009S = \u3008\u03c8|S|d\u3009S = \u3008d|S|u\u3009S = 0. Also, all the operators satisfy the usual boson commutation relations, and all the states (|\u03c8\u3009S, |u\u3009S and |d\u3009S) are normalized. Using these definitions, we introduce the ladder operators as follows,\nJ\u0302+ \u2261 \u221a 2(b\u0302\u20201b\u03020 + b\u0302 \u2020 0b\u0302\u22121), J\u0302\u2212 = J\u0302 \u2020 +. (15)\nNotice that J\u0302+ |\u03c8\u3009S = \u221a 2 |u\u3009S and J\u0302\u2212 |\u03c8\u3009S = \u221a\n2 |d\u3009S, i.e. the ladder operators applied to the initial state simply shift its spectrum to the left or to the right. Making an analogy to a system with angular momentum, the state |\u03c8\u3009S would be a state with angular momentum numbers j = 1,m = 0, the state |u\u3009S would be defined by j = 1,m = 1 and the state |d\u3009S by j = 1,m = \u22121. Thereby, when the initial state of the external field is |\u03c8\u3009S, the cavity is empty, and conditions a-e are satisfied, then the interaction between the external field and the\nmoving mirror, can be described by an effective evolution operator\nU\u0302 = exp [ \u221a 2g(J\u0302\u2212c\u0302 \u2020 \u2212 J\u0302+c\u0302)] = exp [\u2212ig(J\u0302xY\u0302 + J\u0302yX\u0302)], (16)\nwhere J\u0302x, J\u0302y are defined from J\u0302\u00b1 = J\u0302x \u00b1 iJ\u0302y, while the mirror quadratures are X\u0302 = (c\u0302\u2020 + c\u0302)/ \u221a 2 and Y\u0302 = i(c\u0302\u2020 \u2212 c\u0302)/ \u221a 2. In the right hand side of the second identity, the parameter g has been redefined as g \u2261 2g (to avoid carrying the factor of 2). Consequently, the results presented in the previous section can be applied to the\nOMS coupled to an external field, and both measurement strategies (with and without\npostselection) can be compared."

In order to account for the free evolution of the mirror, the variable M\u0302 of the right hand side should be replaced by M\u0302(t) = exp (i\u2126c\u0302\u2020c\u0302t)M\u0302 exp (\u2212i\u2126c\u0302\u2020c\u0302t). Note that given the initial system state (12), the expectation values \u3008J\u0302x\u3009 = \u3008J\u0302y\u3009 = 0. Therefore, there is no change of M\u0302 to first order in g besides its free evolution, i.e. \u3008M\u0302\u3009f = \u3008M\u0302(t)\u3009.

Recall that the terms \u3008X\u0302(t)\u3009 and \u3008Y\u0302 (t)\u3009 correspond to the free evolution of the quadratures. For a thermal state both mean values are zero, while for a coherent state |\u03b1\u3009 the expectation values are \u3008X\u0302(t)\u3009 = \u221a\n2[cos(\u2126t)<(\u03b1) + sin(\u2126t)=(\u03b1)] and \u3008Y\u0302 (t)\u3009 = \u221a 2[cos(\u2126t)=(\u03b1)\u2212 sin(\u2126t)<(\u03b1)].\nOn the other hand, in order to consider the strategy with postselection a method\nto select a pure state should be implemented.

According to expression (10), the quantum\nweak values of J\u0302x and J\u0302y are\nJx,w =\n\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b42\u221a\n2\u03b4 ei(\u03b8+\u03c0/2), Jy,w =\n\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b42\u221a\n2\u03b4 ei(\u03b8+\u03c0). (19)\nNote that both weak values are complex values with the same amplitude but with a phase difference of \u03c0/2 (using a state |\u03c6\u3009S of a more general form, weak values with different amplitudes and phases can be obtained).\nConsider again the observation of the X and Y quadratures of a mirror prepared\nin a thermal state. Expression (7) shows that E(X\u0302|f) = 2(1 +N) (g \u03b4 )\u221a1\u2212 \u03b42 2 sin(\u2126t\u2212 \u03b8), (20)\nAmplification of mechanical quadratures using weak values 9\nE(Y\u0302 |f) = 2(1 +N) (g \u03b4 )\u221a1\u2212 \u03b42 2 cos(\u2126t\u2212 \u03b8). (21)\nThe amplification is therefore proportional to the amplitude of the weak value and the mean number of phonons N \u2261 \u3008c\u0302\u2020c\u0302\u3009. It is worth noting that the amplification depends mainly on the imaginary part of the weak values, which couple to the covariance terms,\nas may be seen in equation (7). For a thermal state, the covariances depend on the\nmean number of phonons (the order of magnitude of the commutators, on the other\nhand, is equal to unity).\nThe limit on the amplification is given by the validity of the approximations (4) and\n(6). As shown in Appendix B, the limit is given by \u03b4 g \u221a N , while the postselection probability (6) corresponds to \u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009f \u2248 \u03b42. Consequently, as compared to the set of equations (17), the change of the quadratures described by (20) and (21) may be\nconsiderable larger, as can be seen in figure 3. On the other hand, from equation (7) it\nis easy to note that for a coherent state E(X\u0302|f) = \u3008X\u0302(t)\u3009+ 2 (g \u03b4 )\u221a1\u2212 \u03b42 2 sin(\u2126t\u2212 \u03b8), (22)\nE(Y\u0302 |f) = \u3008Y\u0302 (t)\u3009+ 2 (g \u03b4 )\u221a1\u2212 \u03b42 2 cos(\u2126t\u2212 \u03b8). (23)\nNotice that the amplification now depends only on the magnitude of the weak values\nbecause the commutators and covariances are both of the order of the unity (unlike the\nprevious case of a thermal state, for which the covariance depends on the number of particles). Since the limit on the amplification is defined by the restriction g \u221a N \u03b4,\nthe amplification may be larger when N is close to unity (the MD contains a small\nnumber of phonons), as shown in figure 4."

            "text": "In this work we have studied the amplification of the quadratures of a moving mirror\nthat weakly interacts with a single photon, mediated by a Fabry-Pe\u0301rot cavity, when\npostselection of photons is performed using an interferometric arrangement. The\namplification of the effect of a single photon on the mirror quadratures depends on\nthe weak values of two hermitian operators (J\u0302x and J\u0302y), whose magnitudes can lie outside the eigenvalue range. The magnitude of the weak values is \u223c \u03b4\u22121, where \u03b4 is a small parameter that corresponds to the transmittance of a beam splitter located at the exit of the interferometric arrangement, while the postselection probability (\u223c \u03b42) is the fraction of light arriving at the dark port of the interferometer. The limit on the amplification by weak values is given by the restriction g \u221a N \u03b4 \u2264 1, where g is a\nscaled coupling constant between the photon and the movable mirror of the cavity, and\nN is the mean number of particles of the mirror. As compared to a standard strategy\nthat does not postselect photons (but employs all of them) the amplification gain may\nbe large. On the other hand, the phases of the weak values may be set in order to\nadjust the time at which the amplification reaches its maximum value. The real parts\nof the weak values couples to the commutators between the mechanical quadratures,\nwhile the imaginary parts to the covariances between the quadratures. For some states,\nsuch as thermal states, the latter depends on the mean number of particles of the MD,\nwhich increases by N the weak value amplification effect produced by the single photon.\nTherefore, in these cases, the amplification occurs mainly due to the imaginary part of\nthe weak values. For coherent states, on the contrary, both terms (commutators and\ncovariances) are of the order of the unity and the amplification effect is based only on\nthe anomalous weak values. The proposed setup might be useful for the estimation of\ng, a parameter that can be small for different optomechanical systems."

Since the initial state has one photon, the state of the whole system (the external optical modes, the cavity mode and the mechanical mode) at any time, |\u03c8(t)\u3009, will belong to the single\nphoton Hilbert space, and can be expressed as |\u03c8(t)\u3009 = |1\u3009cav |\u2205\u3009S \u221e\u2211 m=0 Am(t) |m\u0303\u3009M + |0\u3009cav \u221e\u2211 m=0 |m\u3009M \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9Bm(\u03c9, t)b\u0302 \u2020 \u03c9 |\u2205\u3009S , (A.1) where |m\u0303\u3009M is a displaced number state [40], defined as |m\u0303\u3009M \u2261 exp [(g0/\u2126)(c\u0302\u2020 \u2212 c\u0302)] |m\u3009M , while Am(t) and Bm(\u03c9, t) are the probability amplitudes that satisfy the normalization condition of the state. The first term describes the situation in which the photon is\ninside the cavity, the oscillator in some linear combination of displaced states, and the\nexternal field in the vacuum state. The second term corresponds to the case in which the\nphoton is outside the cavity and eventually entangled to the oscillator (while the cavity\nis empty). Given the initial conditions Am(0) = 0 and Bm(\u03c9, 0) = \u03b4m,nG(\u03c9;\u03c90, ), the Schro\u0308dinger equation can be solved analytically. This is done in [41], from which we\ntake equation (15) to point out that, for long times (t\u0393 1 and t 1), the solution (in a rotating frame with respect to the free hamiltonians of the mirror and the external\nfield) is Am(t) = 0 (no photons remain in the cavity) and\nBm(t) = G(\u03c9;\u03c90, )\u03b4n,m \u2212 i \u221a 2\u03c0\u0393G(\u03c9;\u03c90 + [n\u2212m]\u2126, ) \u221e\u2211 k=0 Cm(k)G(\u03c9; \u2206k,m,\u0393/2),(A.2)\nwhere \u2206k,m = \u03c9cav+\u2126(k\u2212m)\u2212g20/\u2126 and Cm(k) = \u3008m|M |k\u0303\u3009M\u3008k\u0303|M |n\u3009M . The Lorentzian functions G(\u03c9; \u2206k,m,\u0393/2) that appear in the summation do not overlap in the resolved sideband regime, \u0393 \u2126. If \u03c90 is chosen to be \u03c9cav\u2212 g20/\u2126 and the spectral width of the pulse is not larger than the cavity decay rate, \u2264 \u0393, then all terms in the summation, for which k 6= n, will have a neglectable overlap with the fist factor, G(\u03c9;\u03c90 + [n\u2212m]\u2126, ). Therefore, in this scenario only the term k = n will survive, and we can thereby perform\nthe approximation Bm(t) = G(\u03c9;\u03c90, )\u03b4n,m \u2212 i \u221a 2\u03c0\u0393Cm(n)G(\u03c9;\u03c90 + [n\u2212m]\u2126, )G(\u03c9; \u2206n,m,\u0393/2). (A.3)\nFurthermore, if we assume that the pulse is quasi monochromatic, i.e. \u0393, then the product of the two Lorentzian functions in the right hand side can be approximated by G(\u03c9;\u03c90 + [n\u2212m]\u2126, )G(\u03c9 = \u2206n,m; \u2206n,m; \u0393/2), i.e. the second factor is replaced by its maximum value. Consequently,\nBm(t) = G(\u03c9;\u03c90, )\u03b4n,m \u2212 2Cm(n)G(\u03c9;\u03c90 + [n\u2212m]\u2126, ).\nWhen g \u221a n 1, then Cn(n) = 1, Cn\u22121(n) = \u2212g \u221a n and Cn+1 = g \u221a n+ 1, while the rest of the coefficients are neglectable. Therefore, Bn(t) = \u2212G(\u03c9;\u03c90, ), Bn\u22121(t) = 2g \u221a nG(\u03c9;\u03c90+\u2126, ), andBn+1(t) = \u22122g \u221a n+ 1G(\u03c9;\u03c90\u2212\u2126, ), from which the transition (13) can be directly derived by using (A.1)."

(B.2)\nIn order to reduce expression (B.1) to the first order expansion (4), we have to take\ninto account the state of the MD. For a thermal state (and M\u0302 being any quadrature),\nit is easy to show that c0 = c2 = 0. Hence, expression (B.1) is automatically of first order. For a coherent state, two conditions will be required: a) \u03b42c0 g2c2, and b) g\u03b4c1 g2c2. Working out the coefficients it is possible to show that c0 \u223c \u221a N ,\nc1 \u223c (1 + N) and c2 = \u221a N(N + 1). Hence, both conditions will be satisfied when\ng \u221a N \u03b4 (assuming N \u2265 1). Next, let us take into consideration the postselection\nprobability. Adding second order terms to (6), \u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009f = \u03b42 \u2212 2g\u03b4 \u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b42 2\n[ \u3008X\u0302\u3009 sin(\u03b8)\u2212 \u3008Y\u0302 \u3009 cos(\u03b8) ] + 2g2 (1\u2212 \u03b42 2 ) (N + 1). (B.3)\nFor a thermal state, the first order term vanishes. Therefore, in order to disregard the second order term we need to assume that \u03b42 g2N (in the scenario N \u2265 1). With this assumption, the postselection probability simply corresponds to \u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009f \u2248 \u03b42. For a coherent state, on the contrary, the first order term does not vanish. There will be, as\nin the previous analysis, two conditions (the zero and first order terms should dominate over the the second order term). In the case N \u2265 1 both conditions are satisfied when g \u221a N \u03b4. In general, for a MD in a coherent state \u221a Nei\u03b2 the postselection probability\n(B.3) will depend linearly on g, i.e.\n\u3008P\u0302\u03c6\u3009f \u2248 \u03b42 \u2212 2g\u03b4 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b42 \u221a N sin(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b2).
