A report from National Highway Safety Administration of US indicated that the ratio of traffic accidents because of emotional driving like road rage accounted for 9.2\uff05\u223c14.8\uff05 of the total [2]. In\nChina, another report showed that road rage brought about 17.33million illegal acts, leading to 83,100 traffic accidents in 2015, 1.22% higher than that of 2014 [3]. As anger has a negative impact on a driver\u2019s perception, identification, decision, and volition process, the driver will inevitably have a degraded driving performance finally [4]. *en, an angry driver is prone to make more mistakes or lapses or violations, leading to more traffic accident involvements [5]. *erefore, a driving anger detection/warningmethod should be designed for effective intervening to deal with road rage in connected intelligent vehicles nowadays.\nHindawi Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience Volume 2022, Article ID 5698393, 17 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5698393\nRE TR AC TE D\n1.1. Literature Review. To effectively and efficiently identify different emotional states based on multisource heterogeneous data, it is important to select a suitable classification method. Additionally, appropriate emotion elicitation method is also necessary as it is a precondition for emotion detection research. Hence, a brief review of related studies is shown as follows.\n1.2. Emotion Elicitation. When a target emotion is evoked by a specific stimulating scenario, the evoking process is called emotion elicitation. At present, most of emotion elicitation has been executed in quiet laboratory. Kessous et al. [6] adopted a voice interaction with an agent through speaking a sentence in a special contextualization to elicit several common emotions like anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. Juslin and Sloboda [7] proposed amusic-based anger elicitation approach bymeans of different combinations of valences (positive/negative) and arousals (high/low), showing that the greatest anger occurred under the context of negative music with high arousal. Besides those ordinary emotions in daily life, driving emotion elicitation has been becoming a hot research topic. Lei et al. [8] firstly selected video clips extracted from Chinese well-known films including \u201c*eRape ofNanking\u201d and \u201cFist of Fury\u201d as the anger induction materials in driving simulator experiment to study vehicles\u2019 velocity characteristics in anger state. Roidl et al. [9] also induced the subjects\u2019 anger with short film clips from word-wide famous film \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d to study their driving performances including lateral and longitudinal velocity and acceleration in anger state. Abdu et al. [10] made the subjects recall incentive events encountered in their daily life in detail before conducting driving simulator experiment, to elicit their anger for studying their skilled driving behavior and risk taking behavior in anger state. Based on multiple networked driving simulators, Cai and Lin [11] elicited the subjects\u2019 anger state according tomutual interactions like blocking or changing lane abruptly in front of the subject car in networked driving simulators. Danaf et al. [12] used a series of adverse events in controlled intersection to induce the subjects\u2019 anger state in driving simulator experiments for modeling anger and aggressive driving behavior. Nevertheless, most of emotion elicitation methods in those studies are on the basis of video, music, verbal, or behavior interaction or incentive situations in virtual environment, which inevitably limit the universality of the elicitation approaches due to individual cultural background or personal preference. Moreover, the emotion elicited in inner lab is not valid as that elicited in real traffic environment, owing to some demand characteristics or social desirability [13].\n1.3. Emotion Recognition. At present, most of emotion recognition is realized through machine learning algorithms, which can effectively deal with multisource data. Flidlund and Izard [14], at the earliest, identified several emotions including delightfulness, sadness, anger, and fear by linear discriminants based on the subjects\u2019 facial electromyography characteristics. Wang and Gong [15] identified various driving emotions based on a factorization model using physiological features including blood volume pulse, skin conductance (SC), respiration rate\n(RR), and skin temperature. Katsis et al. [16] effectively differentiated car-racing drivers\u2019 several emotions such as high/low stress, dysphoria, and euphoria in a driving simulator environment based on decision tree and Na\u0308\u0131ve Bayesian classifier (NBC) with features of facial electromyography, electrocardiogram, respiration, and electrodermal activity (EDA). Wan et al. [17] implemented a linear discriminant model combined with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to identify driving anger based on five physiological features consisting of SC, RR, heart rate (HR), and relative power spectrum of beta wave (\u03b2%) and theta wave (\u03b8%) in electroencephalogram (EEG). Except for the physiological features, a driver\u2019s operational behaviors and driving performances as well as vehicle motions have also been used for recognizing driving emotions. Malta et al. identified driver\u2019s frustration state based on Bayesian network (BN) with EDA and brake/acceleration pedal actuation features [18]. Lanata\u0300 et al. recognized high and low driving stress through a nearest mean classifier (NMC) based on respiration activity, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal response (EDR) together with steering wheel angle corrections, velocity variance [19]. Wan et al. [20] proposed a detection model of driving anger based on SVM and multivariate time series features of driving behaviors including steeringwheel angle and vehicle lateral position.Danaf et al. [12] proposed a dynamic choice-latent variable model to predict driving anger level with the features of driver personality, incentive situations, and vehicle motion states acquired in driving simulator experiments. In addition, other machine learning algorithms like backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), decision tree (C4.5), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) are often employed to recognize kinds of driving mental states [21].\nSo far, most of the aforementioned studies aim to recognize some usual emotions like delightfulness, sadness, stress, and frustration under lab conditions. Few studies have been conducted to recognize driving anger in real traffic environment, especially in metropolitan area of China, where road rage is a common and serious traffic psychology issue threatening road safety. Furthermore, too many physiological indicators collected by biosensors were utilized in the aforementioned studies. However, most of the current biosensors are intrusive for a driver to some extent due to various electrodes adhering to their skin surface, which may have a negative impact on their naturalistic driving performances. Additionally, most of the current studies only tackle binary discrimination of a certain mental state (e.g., fatigue or not), without more subdivision according to its intensity, which is not helpful to take target intervening measures for a specific mental state with a certain intensity. Moreover, the recognition of driving mental states in those studies is mostly based on neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), fuzzy logic, and Bayes network (BN), which lack effective weight allocation in input indexes and training rules, and its accuracy depends on the completeness of data samples, leading to inefficient data use. Further, those models are not suitable to be applied for recognition system requiring high instantaneity in practice when increasing input variables. For example, the conditional probability tables of BN will have exponential growth when adding a new input, which demands much more computational consumption. Last but not least, when constructing those recognition models, either\nRE TR AC TE D\nvehicle or driver data are utilized without considering the effect of driving environment on mental state whose induction is extremely dependent on a certain environment.\nAiming at that, a high-arousal driving anger elicitation approach is firstly proposed through stimulation of specific incentive situations according to naturalistic driving experiments conducted in real traffic environment, during which nonintrusive measurements like vehicle motions and driving environments, as well as driver personal attributes, will be collected. Secondly, in order to fully utilize the multisource heterogeneous data with uncertainties to effectively and efficiently recognize driving anger states, a double-layered belief rule base (BRB) approach is utilized to propose a recognition model of driving anger states with different intensity. *en, the influencing factors of driving anger could be divided into several groups according to the attribute or category of those factors. In each group, the inference process can be separately executed in an iterative way, which reduces dimensions of the BRB greatly, especially for only one layer, meaning less complicated computation and higher instantaneity. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model are evaluated and compared with other widely used classification algorithms."

            "text": "2.1. Scene Design. In order to make every subject generate anger as much as possible, a special test route containing many busy sections across Wuchang and Hankou District of Wuhan was designed for naturalistic driving experiments conducted in this study (see Figure 1(a)). *e test route was almost 50.8 km, which included two tunnels, two expressways, three central business districts, 42 signalized intersections, and 59 zebra crossings. When conducting the experiment, every subject would often confront incentive environmental events or situations, such as weaving/cutting in line, jaywalking/motorcycle occupying road, traffic jams, or traffic light waiting, which randomly and frequently happened, especially during morning and evening rush hours (see Figures 1(b)\u20131(d)). Hence, each subject was required to begin the experiment at about 8:00 a.m. or 5:00 p.m. In order to induce more anger further, every subject was promised to get extra paid if they could complete the experiment ahead of reference time. Note that no speeding was permitted during the whole experiment. Simultaneously, to induce anger as real as possible, the driving experiments are designed to be single-blind, namely, naturalistic, which means that every subject would conduct the whole experiment alone without any interference, according to their own driving style in daily life.\n2.2. Participants. Forty-two private car drivers with valid C1 license were enrolled from Wuhan, a fast-growing central metropolis in China, to conduct naturalistic experiments. In order to maximize the statistical power, much more male subjects were chosen in this study, as males are more prone to be involved in angry driving than females [22]. *e average age of the subjects was 37.8 (SD\ufffd 5.4) years, while their\naverage driving age was 9.8 (SD\ufffd 4.6) years. *e population distribution of the subjects with different demographic characteristics is shown in Table 1. It is noted that every subject should be checked to be in good mental condition through a profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire, which is important to verify the effectiveness of the driving anger elicitation approach proposed in this study. Additionally, an observer (expert) with rich driving experience (>20 years) in driving behavior field was recruited to assess every subject\u2019s anger level according to the video replay of the whole experiment process.\n2.3. Apparatus. Related research indicated that dangerous driving behaviors such as fatigue, anger, and distraction can be identified according to lateral and longitudinal vehicle motions including yaw rate, acceleration (longitudinal), and lane departure [23, 24]. Hence, a car (see Figure 2(a)) instrumented with Mobileye C2-270 system (see Figure 2(b)) and Inertial Navigation System RT2500 (see Figure 2(c)) was used as the experimental vehicle for conducting naturalistic driving experiments. It is noted that Mobileye C2-270 system is a collision warning system that can collect time headway and lane departure data, while Inertial Navigation System RT2500 is a precise vehicle motion acquisition system that can collect the heading, pitch, and roll motion characteristics of vehicle movements like yaw angular acceleration rate and longitudinal acceleration. Moreover, a clock was equipped on dash board of the test car to remind every subject of the remaining time of the experiment.\nAdditionally, three high-definition cameras with resolution ratio of 800 \u2217 640 and frame rate of 30 (see Figure 2(d)) were pasted on the front windshield of the test vehicle to record every subject\u2019s physical or behavior reaction and driving environments around. In more detail, the first camera was used to record driving environments around like unfavorable traffic environments (i.e., jam and congestion) and incentive events from surrounding traffic participants (i.e., jaywalk and cutting in line). *e second one was implemented to record the subject\u2019s facial (i.e., frown and straight face) or verbal (i.e., curse and name-calling) expression and head movement. *e third one was utilized to roughly record the subject\u2019s fiercely operational (high frequency or large amplitude) behaviors of steering wheel, gear lever, and other physical behaviors like slapping steering wheel or frequent honking. *e video replay from the three cameras will be implemented as intuitive evidence to calibrate driving anger level for every subject and the expert."

Meanwhile, the observer also utilized the ten-point scale to evaluate the subject\u2019s emotional level, so as to correct some subjects\u2019 terribly subjective self-report, which had seriously deviated from the truth."

According to the feedback from all subjects, every subject underwent several different emotions throughout the whole experimental process. *en, it is necessary to verify if the target emotion (i.e., anger) has been induced out during driving using the novel anger induction approach proposed in this study. Here, the hit rate was applied as an indicator to assess driving anger inducing effect. As each subject had to self-report their emotional type and level every two minutes and any instant an incentive driving environment (situations) occurred during driving, 2414 emotional cases in all were acquired from all subjects, 1194 of which are anger instances. As indicated in Table 2, the hit rate is 8.27% if no incentive situations occurred during driving, meaning that the extra paid for accomplishing experiment ahead of reference time did give the subjects a little time pressure. Note that the hit rate under stimulus of jaywalking/motorcycle occupying road is highest with 82.03%, while the lowest with 56.94% under the stimulus of traffic lights waiting. To sum up, the average hit rate of anger under the incentive situations reaches 74.25% (i.e., (1194\u201375)/(2414\u2013907)), significantly higher than that under no incentive situations. *erefore, the novel anger induction approach proposed in this study is effective. 3.2. Driving Anger Intensity Calibration. In order to effectively and efficiently reduce the negative effect of road rage on traffic safety and efficiency, it is extremely critical to take the target warning or intervening for different driving anger states with different intensity. In this study, different anger states were calibrated based on the subjects\u2019 self-reported anger levels. It is noted that when calibrating driving anger states, any subject\u2019s self-report would be immediately adopted if the assessment discrepancy between the subject and the observer is smaller than 2, or else, three more independent experts (driving years \u226525) in the field of traffic psychology would be invited to reassess the subject\u2019s anger level based on the replayed video.

Consequently, 1194 anger-related samples including low anger, mediate anger, and high anger, as well as 935 neutral (none anger) samples, shown in Figure 3, were determined for the following study. As aforementioned, some typical vehicle motions characteristics like yaw rate, acceleration, and lane departure can reflect dangerous or aggressive driving behavior. In addition, some personal characteristics including gender, age, and temperament, as well as environmental (situational) like traffic congestion and illegal traffic behaviors around, are decisive influencing factors of road rage [26].*erefore, after calibrating the four kinds of driving anger states (modes) in\nterms of intensity, those corresponding vehicle characteristics, human characteristics, and environmental characteristics in line with a certain driving anger mode at that moment were all screened for constructing driving anger detection model. *en, 2129 driving samples including 1194 anger-related samples and 935 neutral (none anger) samples are partly listed in Table 3. According to the feedbacks from the participants, it is worth noting that any anger state with certain intensity would remain unchanged about 6\u223c10 seconds until the new elicitation situation with different intensity occurs. Hence, vehicle motion signals lasting 8 (i.e., average) seconds from the moment the elicitation situation occurred were chosen for study driving anger characteristics."

            "text": "4.1. Belief Rule Base (BRB) Inference Approach. Yang et al. proposed an innovative inference approach, called belief rule base (BRB), to solve complicated decision-making problem [27].*e BRB approach can effectively deal with quantitative and qualitative information with uncertainty, incompleteness, subjectivity, and nonlinearity.*e core of the approach is a hybrid rule base, which is established with a belief structure based on evidence theory of Dempster-Shafer, decision theory, and fuzzy inference [28]. In order to improve the approach\u2019s inference accuracy, the weights of rules and attributes as well as belief degree of output are introduced on the basis of traditional rule expression methods like fuzzy inference, during the BRB inference process using evidential reasoning (ER).\n4.1.1. Belief Rule Base Structure. With regard to BRB inference methodology, the kth rule Rk of the rule base is expressed as follows:\nRk: If x1 isA k 1 \u2227 x2 isA k 2 \u2227 . . .\u2227xTk isA k Tk , then\nD1, \u03b21k( , D2, \u03b22k( , . . .

(2)\nIf the kth rule is incomplete, then\n\nN\nj\ufffd1 \u03b2jk < 1, (3)\nwhere xi(i \ufffd 1, 2, . . . , Tk) denotes the ith antecedent attribute (input variable) in the kth rule (Rk); Tk is the number of antecedent attributes in Rk, Aki is the referential value of the ith antecedent attribute in Rk; Dj is the jth (j \ufffd 1, 2, . . . ,N) consequent (output variable) in Rk; \u03b2jk is the belief degree of Dj;N is the number of all consequents; \u03b8k is the weight of kth rule; L is the number of all rules in rule base. \u03b4ik is the weight of ith antecedent attribute in Rk.\nAccording to equation (1), we can see that the belief ifthen rule structure proposed is superior to traditional if-then rule, where the consequent is either 100% true or 100% false, leading to a strictly limited ability when representing rule (knowledge) in a real and complex world. *e proposed structure can provide better flexibility in representing rule with simple or complicated, quantitative or qualitative, continuous or discrete, certain or uncertain relationship between the input and output.\nTable 2: Hit rate of five emotions from the scenarios with and without incentive situations.\nIncentive situations Fear Happy Anger Sad Neutral Total Hit rate (%) No incentive situations 8 40 75 5 779 907 8.27 Jaywalking/motorcycle occupying road 44 4 388 10 27 473 82.03 Weaving/cutting in line 55 5 366 20 36 482 75.88 Traffic jam/congestion 17 8 242 27 42 336 72.02 Traffic lights waiting 12 7 123 23 51 216 56.94 Total 136 64 1194 85 935 2414\n219\n935430\n545\nModerate anger High anger Neutral Low anger\nFigure 3: Instances of different anger states.\nRE TR AC TE D 4.1.2. BRB Inference Using ER. In order to compute the activation weight of kth rule Rk, the matching degree (i.e., membership) of the input xi to the referential values of this antecedent attribute of Rk needs to be calculated firstly. *e membership can be calculated by using utility-based equivalence transformation techniques, shown as follows: a k i,q \ufffd A k i,q+1 \u2212 xi  A k i,q+1 \u2212 A k i,q  , A k i,q < xi \u2264A k i,q+1, a k i,q+1 \ufffd xi \u2212 A k i,q  A k i,q+1 \u2212 A k i,q  , A k i,q < xi \u2264A k i,q+1, (4) where xi(i \ufffd 1, 2, . . . , Tk) denotes the ith input variable in Rk; Aki,q, Aki,q+1 are the two adjacent referential values of xi, respectively; aki,q is the degree to which the input xi belongs to the referential value Aki,q, while aki,q+1 is the degree to which the input xi belongs to the referential value Aki,q+1. After determining aki,q, the activation weight of the kth rule wk is calculated as follows: wk \ufffd \u03b8k  Tk i\ufffd1 \u03b1 k i,q  \u03b4i  L l\ufffd1 \u03b8l  Tl i\ufffd1 \u03b1 l i,q  \u03b4i   , (5) where \u03b4i \ufffd \u03b4i/maxi\ufffd1,...,Tk \u03b4i . If \u03b4i \ufffd 0, then (\u03b1 k i,n) \u03b4i \ufffd 1; it indicates that the ith antecedent attribute does not have any impact on activation weight of Rk. If \u03b4i \ufffd 1, then (\u03b1ki,n) \u03b4i \ufffd \u03b1ki,n, It indicates that the ith antecedent attribute has the biggest impact on activation weight of Rk. Given that the input is denoted by X, the outcome of BRB inference is then denoted as follows: Y(x) \ufffd Dj, \u03b2j , j \ufffd 1, 2, 3, . . . .N . (6) Equation (6) can be interpreted as the consequent is D1 with of a belief degree of \u03b21, D2 with a belief degree of \u03b22, . . ., and DN with a belief degree of \u03b2N. Based on the analytical format of ER approach, the combined belief degree \u03b2j can be calculated as follows:\n\u03b2n \ufffd \nL k\ufffd1 wk\u03b2n,k + 1 \u2212 wk  N i\ufffd1 \u03b2i,k  \u2212  L k\ufffd1 1 \u2212 wk  N i\ufffd1 \u03b2i,k \n N j\ufffd1  L k\ufffd1 wk\u03b2j,k + 1 \u2212 wk  N i\ufffd1 \u03b2i,k  \u2212 (N \u2212 1)  L k\ufffd1 1 \u2212 wk  N i\ufffd1 \u03b2i,k  \u2212  L k\ufffd1 1 \u2212 wk( \n. (7)\nAfter \u03b2n is determined, the driving anger states with different intensity can be calculated as follows:\nAnger(Y) \ufffd D1\u03b21 + D2\u03b22 + . . . + DN\u03b2N.

            "text": "Considering different structures and sources of input data for driving anger detection model, a double-layered BRB (Dl_BRB) system is proposed in this study, as shown in Figure 5. *e first layer consists of human (driver) status inference subsystem, vehicle status inference subsystem, and environment status inference subsystem.*e second layer is to determine the driver\u2019s anger state based on the three subsystem\u2019s inference results, which are used as the inputs of the second layer. For the subsystem1, there are three human characteristics (x1, x2, x3) used as the inputs, while three vehicle characteristics (x4, x5, x6) and two environmental characteristics (x7, x8) are used as the inputs for subsystem 2\nand subsystem 3, respectively. Especially, u1, u2, u3 are intermediate variables to denote driver status, vehicle status, and environment status, respectively, which are used to inference the driver\u2019s anger states (y). *e definition of all input variables (x1, x2, ..., x8) and output variable (y) is listed in Table 4. For example, x1, x2, x3 represent the driver\u2019s gender, age, and temperament, respectively.\nAs indicated in Figure 5, the input variables of the proposed model were comprised of three types of characteristics including human, vehicle, and environments, while the output variable of the proposed model is driving anger state (y). Moreover, the human characteristics consisted of gender (x1), age (x2), and temperament (x3), the vehicle characteristics consisted of yaw angular acceleration (x4), longitudinal acceleration (x5), and lane departure (x6), and the environment characteristics consisted of traffic flow state (x7) and surrounding traffic behaviors (x8), shown in Table 4.\nAccording to the distribution trait of those human, vehicle, and environment characteristics data, the interpretation or the reference values for every input variable with different grades were determined, as shown in Table 5. For instance, temperament, denoted by x3, can be classified in to 4 different grades including melancholic, phlegmatic, sanguineous, and choleric, while the longitudinal acceleration, denoted by x5, can be graded into 3 levels with references of 1m/s2, 1.5m/s2, and 2m/s2, respectively. It is noted that the reference value for the different grades of yaw angular acceleration (x4), longitudinal acceleration (x5), and lane departure (x6) were determined according to their statistical data for the four driving anger states including neutral, low anger, moderate anger, and high anger. *e relevant statics were studied in several previous research conducted by the authors in this study [20, 24, 29]. Moreover, traffic behavior around, denoted by x8, was graded in to 3 different types, namely, normal, less severe, and severe, respectively. It is noted that waiting traffic lights belongs to normal traffic behavior around, and weaving/ cutting in line or traffic jam/congestion belongs to less sever traffic behavior around, while jaywalking/motorcycle occupying road belongs to severe traffic behaviors around.\nIn this study, the initial belief rules of the proposed model were constructed based on the relevant expert knowledge and historical driving anger data with certain subjectivity. It is worth noting that, in terms of the second layer of the prosed model, all intermediate variables (u1, u2, u3) were graded into three levels, and then there exists 27 rules (3\u03023), shown in Table 6. Moreover, the final consequents were expressed in four types of driving anger states, namely,\nneutral (none anger), low anger, moderate anger, and high anger, with a belief degree of \u03b21k, \u03b22k, \u03b23k and \u03b24k respectively.\nAs the initial belief rule base (BRB) is imprecise with certain subjectivity, the training of the initial BRB system was conducted according to equations (11) and (12). *en, 60% of samples were randomly selected from the original\n2129 driving anger-related samples collected in the naturalistic experiments for training the initial BRB systems. *e training processes were executed in optimization toolbox of Matlab, which mainly included computing the matching degree of the input (xi) to the reference value (Aki ), the activation weight of rule (Rk), the belief degree of the jth consequent (output) in Rk, and minimizing the discrepancy\nAC\nTE D\nTable 4: Input variables and output variables of the proposed Dl_BRB system.\nAntecedent attributes (human) Antecedent attributes (environment) Gender x1 Traffic flow state x7 Age x2 Traffic behaviors around x8 Temperament x3 Antecedent attributes (vehicle) System output Yaw angular acceleration x4 Driving anger states yLongitudinal acceleration x5 Lane departure x6\nTable 5: Graduation and reference value for the input and output variables.\nInput Grade Reference value Input Grade Reference value\nx1 1 Male-1\nx6\n1 Small-0.350 2 Female-2 2 Medium-0.562\nx2\n1 Young-25 3 Large-0.725 2 Average-35\nx7\nSmooth 1 3 Old-45 Less smooth 2\nx3\n1 Melancholic-1 Obstructive 3 2 Phlegmatic-2\nx8 Normal 1 3 Sanguineous-3 Less severe 2 4 Choleric-4 Severe 3\nx4\n1 Low-1.75 Output Grade Reference value 2 Medium-2.00\nY\nNeutral 0 3 High-2.50 Low anger 1\nx5\n1 Low-1.0 Moderate anger 2 2 Medium-1.5 High anger 3 3 High-2.0\nRE TR AC TE D\nbetween the observed output and the estimated output calculated by the proposed model.

            "text": "4.3.1. Evaluation Criteria. To verify the identification accuracy of the Dl_BRB model proposed in this study, an evaluation method of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was implemented. *e ROC method was widely used to evaluate classification performance of a classifier in discrimination fields like medical diagnosis, military monitoring, and human decision-making [30]. For a specific discrimination threshold, namely, cut-off point, it can differentiate positive samples from negative ones with a certain true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). When depicting the cut-off point in a coordinate system with horizontal and vertical ordinate, represented by TPR and FPR, respectively, a complete ROC curve will be formed by connecting all the possible cut-off points with a broken line in the coordinate system. Moreover, the greater the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is, the higher the identification accuracy of the classifier is. Except for TPR, FPR, and AUC, other statistical indexes such as positive predictive accuracy (PPA), F1 and Acc are also extensively applied when evaluating a classifier\u2019s classification performance. *ose statistical indexes are calculated as follows:\nTPR \ufffd TP\nTP + FN ,\nFPR \ufffd\ufffd FP\nTN + FP ,\nPPA \ufffd TP\nTP + FP ,\nF1 \ufffd 2 \u00d7 TPR \u00d7 PPA\nTPR + PPA ,\nAcc \ufffd TP + TN\nTP + FN + TN + FP ,\n(13)\nwhere TP is the number of positive samples, which were correctly identified as positive ones; FP is the number of negative samples, which are falsely identified as positive ones; TN is the number of negative samples, which are correctly identified as negative ones; FN is the number of positive samples, which are falsely identified as negative ones. Here, driving anger samples with a specific intensity are assumed to be positive, while the other driving anger samples are assumed to be negative. Note that PPA demonstrates the correct identification probability of the samples, which are identified as positive ones.\n4.3.2. Identification Performance. *e identification performance of the proposed model (Dl_BRB) for four driving anger states with different intensity was evaluated using a test set accounting for 40% of the total samples, which was\ncomprised of 374 neutral (none anger) samples, 218 low anger samples, 172 moderate anger samples, and 88 high anger samples. Further, in order to verify the superiority of the proposed model, we compared it with other 5 widely used classifiers like C4.5, NBC, SVM, kNN, and BPNN in terms of AUC of the corresponding ROC curves for the four driving anger states, illustrated in Figure 6.\nAs indicated in Figure 6, the identification performance of Dl_BRB model proposed in this study outperforms C4.5, NBC, KNN, SVM, and BPNN, as the proposed model has an average AUC of 0.8632, which is the biggest among them, according to the ROC curves for all driving anger states. Specially, the performance of the proposed model is evidently higher than the other five models when identifying neutral (none anger) state (p \ufffd 0.074) and high anger state (p \ufffd 0.069) in terms of AUC, yet the superiority is small and not significant when the significance level is set to be 0.05. In addition, when identifying the low anger state, the differences of AUC between the proposed model and other five models are much smaller than those of the other three driving anger states. Moreover, the average of AUC of all six identification models is the smallest for low anger state. *e possible reason is that the changes of human, vehicle, and environmental characteristics under low anger state are evidently smaller than those of other driving anger states.\nFurthermore, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the five-fold cross-validation method was used to test the six classification models, with the results being indicated in Figure 7. We can see that the proposed Dl_BRB model achieves better identification performances in terms of PPA, TPR, and F1 when compared with C4.5, BPNN, NBC, SVM, and kNN. Especially, the identification performances of the proposed model are remarkably (p \ufffd 0.038< 0.05) better than those of the other five models in terms of the three criteria for high anger state. However, for FPR, another important evaluation criterion, the proposed model does not perform the best, as the model of C4.5 has the lowest value of FPR when identifying all driving anger states.\nIn summary, the average of the aforementioned criteria and the total accuracy for identifying all driving anger states using the proposed model (Dl_BRB) and the other five widely implemented models were statistically analyzed, with the results being shown in Table 8. *en, we can see that the proposed model outperforms the other five models in most aspects including TPR (0.8433), PPA (0.9187), F1 (0.8793), and Acc (0.8367). *ough the model of C4.5 is superior to the proposed model in terms of FPR, the mean value of FPR of the proposed model is only 0.0792, ranking the second among these models, which is acceptable for detecting driving anger states in practice. Additionally, in order to verify the efficiency of the proposed model, the run speed of these models was compared in MATLAB environment for the same test data. Here, we let the runtime of BPNN model as unit one, and the runtime ratio of the other five models was computed, with the results being shown in the last row of Table 8. It is shown that the runtime ratio of the proposed model ranks the second, just behind C4.5, among the six models, indicating that the computation ability of the\nRE TR AC TE D\nTable 7: *e trained belief rule base of BRB subsystem 4.\nRule ID Input U (intermediate variable) attribute weight 0.934 1 0.968 Output y (belief degree)\nRule weight u1 u2 u3 Ang_N Ang_L Ang_M Ang_H\n1 0.9745 1 1 1 0.9925 0.0047 0.0025 0.0003 2 0.8742 1 1 2 0.7903 0.2084 0.0013 0.0000 3 0.8063 1 1 3 0.6900 0.2134 0.0933 0.0033 4 0.7551 1 2 1 0.6114 0.2981 0.0804 0.0001 5 0.7264 1 2 2 0.5093 0.2906 0.2001 0.0000 6 0.5552 1 2 3 0.4987 0.2047 0.1976 0.0990 7 0.4327 1 3 1 0.4128 0.3896 0.1072 0.0904 8 0.1685 1 3 2 0.3884 0.3125 0.1976 0.1015 9 0.3745 1 3 3 0.2124 0.3842 0.3142 0.0892 10 0.7264 2 1 1 0.4137 0.2817 0.3045 0.0001 11 0.5572 2 1 2 0.3125 0.3032 0.3019 0.0824 12 0.4613 2 1 3 0.2826 0.3216 0.2105 0.1853 13 0.4482 2 2 1 0.2256 0.4125 0.2753 0.0866 14 0.6164 2 2 2 0.1196 0.1316 0.3763 0.3725 15 0.7735 2 2 3 0.0015 0.1147 0.2872 0.5966 16 0.6981 2 3 1 0.0023 0.1873 0.4316 0.3788 17 0.7762 2 3 2 0.0046 0.0792 0.3247 0.5915 18 0.8614 2 3 3 0.0032 0.0041 0.2879 0.7048 19 0.4867 3 1 1 0.1145 0.2236 0.2974 0.3645 20 0.7786 3 1 2 0.0963 0.0842 0.2771 0.5424 21 0.6582 3 1 3 0.0074 0.1854 0.3882 0.4190 22 0.6963 3 2 1 0.0043 0.2352 0.2744 0.4861 23 0.4345 3 2 2 0.0172 0.2163 0.1882 0.5783 24 0.6625 3 2 3 0.0094 0.1125 0.1859 0.6922 25 0.5936 3 3 1 0.0015 0.0083 0.2305 0.7597 26 0.7652 3 3 2 0.0019 0.0026 0.1348 0.8607 27 0.9884 3 3 3 0.0003 0.0012 0.0043 0.9942\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nFalse Positive Rate (FPR)\nTr ue\nP os\niti ve\nR at\ne ( TP\nR)\nDl-BRB C4.5 BPNN NB\nSVM kNN Reference\n(a)\nTr ue\nP os\niti ve\nR at\ne ( TP\nR)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nFalse Positive Rate (FPR)\nDl-BRB C4.5 BPNN NB\nSVM kNN Reference\n(b)\nFigure 6: Continued.\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE D Tr ue\nP os\niti ve\nR at\ne ( TP\nR)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nFalse Positive Rate (FPR)\nDl-BRB C4.5 BPNN NB\nSVM kNN Reference\n(c)\nTr ue\nP os\niti ve\nR at\ne ( TP\nR)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nFalse Positive Rate (FPR)\nDl-BRB C4.5 BPNN NB\nSVM kNN Reference\n(d)\nFigure 6: Comparison of ROC curves between Dl_BRB and other five widely used models when identifying four driving anger states.

            "text": "*ere are two contributions made in this study to the traffic psychology and driving behavior fields especially angry driving. *e first one is that a novel driving anger elicitation approach was proposed to collect the relevant human (driver), vehicle, and environment characteristics in driving anger state. *e second one is to propose an effective model based on those heterogeneous characteristics to identify different driving anger states with different intensity. *en, in practice, some soft interferences like releasing soft or relaxed music or comfortable human-machine interaction through conversation can be executed when low or moderate anger state is detected, while some hard interferences like controlling steering wheel or brake or acceleration pedal is taken over by human-machine codriving system when high anger state is detected in intelligent connected vehicle in the near future.\nFirst, in order to induce real anger emotion during driving, a particularly busy route was selected as the test\nroute for the naturalistic experiments. On the test route, every participant inevitably came across sorts of incentive situations like jaywalking, motorcycle occupying road, weaving or cutting in line, traffic jam or congestion, and traffic light waiting, especially in morning or evening rush hours. *e study results indicate that the hit rate of anger under the incentive situations reaches 74.25%, significantly higher than that under no incentive situations, and the highest hit rate (82.03%) of anger happened under the stimulus of jaywalking/motorcycle occupying road. Hence, some targeted and detailed countermeasures can be taken in practice. For example, once those kinds of uncivil (illegal) traffic behaviors are captured by cameras of electrical police, the personal information of pedestrian or the motorcycle rider like their portrait or the ID card number will be exposed on the big screen located on the intersection or roadside based on image identification and big data technology. Moreover, they might be fined if there is a real traffic police on the scene, as well as an increased insurance next year if they have driving license. In addition, every traffic participant should be encouraged to report those uncivil (illegal) traffic behaviors through some official APPs designed by traffic management authorities. *erefore, the novel anger elicitation approach proposed in this study is effective based on the induction of those incentive situations\n0.75\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95 Dl_BRB\nC4.5\nBPNN\nNBC\nSVM\nkNN\nTPR PPA F1\n(d)\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15 Dl_BRB\nC4.5\nBPNN\nNBC\nSVM\nkNN\nNeutral Moderate anger Low anger High anger\n(e)\nFigure 7: *e identification performances of the proposed model and other five models.

Interestingly, there was inconsistency with previous findings, in which the most driving anger provoking event was discourtesy behavior from surrounding traffic participants in western countries like USA [31] and France [32]. *e possible reason for that might be Chinese drivers often travelled with strong mixed traffic modes including motor and nonmotor vehicles and pedestrians competing with each other on the limited road lanes in a rapid pace of life nowadays. Additionally, different traffic rules, life style, culture background, and safety awareness also exerted an effect on the differences of driving anger provoking situations. Moreover, in China, Feng et al. [33] found that the most driving anger provoking situation for professional drivers was traffic obstruction; especially the road works sign was not set when the road was under reconstruction, showing a little disagreement with this study, in which Jaywalking/motorbike occupying road was the most driving anger provoking for private car drivers. *erefore, more target countermeasures should be put forward on monitoring and regulation of uncivilized or illegal travelling behaviors for driving training or traffic management authorities in China.\nSecondly, according to previous research conducted by the authors in this study, the human characteristics like gender, age, and temperament, the environmental characteristics like traffic behaviors around and traffic flow state, and the vehicular characteristics like yaw angular acceleration, longitudinal acceleration, and lane departure have close relationship with driving anger [26, 29]. *en, those human, vehicular, and environmental characteristics were selected as the inputs for the establishing driving anger detection model. In this study, a data-driven model based upon belief rule base (BRB), which can continually utilize the accumulated filed data collected during the naturalistic experiments, is proposed to detect driving anger states with different intensity. *e BRB based model has much advantage in processing not only objective information like vehicular characteristics data but also subjective information such as human and environmental characteristics data [27]. Moreover, a double-layered BRB (Dl_BRB) system including four BRB subsystems for inferring human, vehicular, and environmental state was constructed to reduce the number of rules to be estimated at the same time for improving the timely response. *e study results show that the average identification accuracy (Acc) of the proposed model for detecting all driving anger states including neutral, low anger, moderate anger, and high anger reaches 83.67%, which is 1.15%, 1.52%, 3.53%, 5.75%, and 7.42% higher than C4.5, BPNN, NBC, SVM, and kNN, respectively. Besides, the proposedmodel is superior to thosemodels in terms of other evaluation criteria such as TPR, PPA, and F1, indicating that the proposed model is effective to detect driving anger states in practice. However, the evaluation criterion of false positive rate (FPR) of the proposed model does not have superiority when compared with C4.5, a widely used decision tree algorithm.*e reason for this is that maybe the inputs of the proposed model do not include any physiological\ncharacteristics, which can precisely reflect the driver\u2019s mental fluctuation [34, 35]. Correspondingly, more physiological characteristics should be taken into consideration when constructing a driving anger detection model. In addition, the run time of the proposed model does not perform best amongst these widely used classification models, which means that the input variables set needs more optimization by feature selection algorithms to reduce the proposed model\u2019s computation complexity.\nNevertheless, there still exist several obvious limitations in this study. Firstly, considering easy recruiting and significant anger induction effect, much more male drivers were recruited as the participants for the naturalistic experiments conducted in this study. *en, much more female drivers should be recruited to improve the universality of the proposed model afterwards. Additionally, female drivers frequently get angrier than males when confronting traffic block. Nonetheless, they are inclined to make more adaptive adjustments instead of aggression behaviors when they get angry [22]. *us, more traffic situations like traffic congestion, red light waiting, and jaywalking can be used to trigger anger for female drivers. And the measurements including physiological or facial expression characteristics instead of physical behaviors and verbal aggressions can be utilized to demonstrate anger expression differences between female drivers and male drivers. Secondly, the naturalistic experiments for this study were conducted in Wuhan, a typical central metropolis in China. Nevertheless, there exist some geography variances of pace of life, traffic safety awareness, or quality between Wuhan and other typical western cities (e.g., Chengdu), northern cities (e.g., Beijing), eastern cities (e.g., Shanghai), and southern cities (e.g., Guangzhou). *erefore, the succeeding experiments should be added in those typical cities due to the geography differences, which can result in the differences of anger induction factors. *irdly, with the rapid development of wearable devices and intelligent connected vehicles, some physiological indicators like heart rate and respiration rate can be collected to detect driving anger states more accurately."
