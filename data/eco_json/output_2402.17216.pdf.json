Cloud computing refers to the centralized computing resources, users through the access to the centralized resources to complete the calculation, the cloud computing center will return the results of the program processing to the user. Cloud computing is not only for individual users, but also for enterprise users. By purchasing a cloud server, users do not have to buy a large number of computers, saving computing costs. Cloud service providers can dynamically schedule computing resources according to users' access requirements to maximize computing resource utilization efficiency. According to a report by China Economic News Network, the scale of cloud computing in China has reached 209.1 billion yuan. At present, the more mature cloud service providers in China are Ali Cloud, Baidu Cloud, Huawei Cloud and so on. Rational allocation of resources plays a crucial role in cloud computing. In the resource allocation of cloud computing, the cloud computing center has limited cloud resources, and users arrive in sequence. Each user requests the cloud computing center to use a certain number of cloud resources at a specific time. The cloud computing service center needs to decide whether to accept the user's request or put the user's request on hold. Reasonable allocation of cloud resources can maximize the quality of service users and improve user satisfaction under limited resources. Most of the existing resource allocation algorithms use heuristic algorithms to allocate\nresources, but it is difficult for heuristic algorithms to achieve good results in complex situations. The resource allocation of cloud computing needs to consider various needs of users. Different users have different requirements on cloud resources. The cloud computing center needs to allocate resources according to user requirements. Users' demand for cloud resources can be divided into two types of constraints, namely, hard constraints and soft constraints. Hard constraints refer to the constraints that must be met. For example, a user requests a group of VMS instead of a single VM. To ensure high availability, each VM needs to be placed in a separate fault domain (a server sharing a single point of failure) to avoid economic losses caused by the failure of the cloud computing center. Soft constraints refer to constraints that can or can not be satisfied, but satisfying constraints can significantly improve service quality. For example, in the process of neural network training, placing cloud virtual machines close to each other in the network structure can reduce network latency and speed up computing. During the processing of user requests, VMS that are geographically close to users can improve the communication speed between the cloud computing center and users and improve user experience. This study mainly proposes a cloud resource allocation method based on deep reinforcement learning considering user needs. This study mainly considers assigning users to servers that are close to improve the service quality of users. However, if users are assigned to servers that are close to them, some servers may be congested and the waiting time will be long. Therefore, this study considers a cloud resource allocation method based on deep reinforcement learning. Deep reinforcement learning can determine the dynamic allocation of resources according to the current state of the system, thus maximizing the utilization efficiency of cloud resources and reducing user waiting time.\nII.

            "heading": "B. Resource scheduling considering time-varying characteristics",
            "text": "The study of Mondal et al. (2021) focuses on the differences in resource utilization over different time periods when users use cloud computing resources for a long period of time, especially in cloud computing tasks such as neural network training that require a long running time. Considering the different requirements of users for computing resources in different time periods, it can effectively reduce the pressure on servers during peak hours and reduce the risk of server downtime. In this study, an unsupervised learning method is used to learn the time-varying characteristics of user resource utilization by constructing a learner that utilizes the historical characteristics of user resource use. At the same time, the research puts forward a variety of new reward evaluation mechanisms. The framework of the study is as follows:\nIn this framework, users' historical resource usage data is first collected and analyzed to understand patterns and trends in resource utilization over different time periods. This data is then used to train the model to learn how the user's resource needs change over time. Next, according to the learned pattern, develop a resource allocation strategy to allocate resources reasonably in different time periods, so as to reduce the pressure on the server and reduce the risk of downtime. Finally, a new incentive evaluation mechanism is used to evaluate and optimize the resource allocation strategy to improve the system performance and efficiency. The research of Mondal et al. provides an innovative solution to the resource allocation problem in long-term cloud computing tasks, and makes an important contribution to improving the efficiency and stability of resource utilization in cloud computing environments. As illustrated in Figure 2, in comparison with section 2.1, this study introduces a novel approach by initially employing clustering techniques to forecast the time-evolving behaviors of users in their utilization of cloud resources. This proactive measure aims to preempt the confluence of peak usage periods among different users, a scenario that would otherwise exert immense strain on the server infrastructure. Within the realm of clustering methodology, a combination of autoregressive analysis, linear trend analysis, and dynamic time warping techniques is predominantly employed. Additionally, the inclusion of dynamic time warping facilitates the identification of users exhibiting similar temporal utilization patterns through the application of K-means clustering. This multifaceted approach not only enhances the predictive capabilities regarding resource utilization dynamics but also lays the groundwork for proactive resource allocation strategies aimed at alleviating server pressure and optimizing resource allocation efficiency. In the part of deep reinforcement learning, the idea of this study is roughly similar to that of Study 1. Study 2 puts forward a number of definitions of reward worthy of reference.

Task scheduling/unloading with priority constraints  Optimization Problem\nIn the cloud computing resource allocation and task scheduling system, complex tasks are decomposed into multiple subtasks to form task flows and then allocated to processors for parallel processing in order to enhance computational efficiency. As certain tasks' computations depend on the results of previous tasks and priority constraints exist among tasks, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be utilized to abstract and model the workflow. In this model, nodes represent subtasks, and edges between nodes denote priority constraints among subtasks. Literature [4] provides a tree diagram of the DAG scheduling problem, considering factors such as communication time between tasks, processor resource limitations, and interconnectivity between processors.\n Mathematical Model and Related Algorithms\nThe priority constraints between tasks can be expressed as EST(j) \u2264 CT(i), for all i\u2192j, where EST(j) denotes the earliest time task j can begin processing, CT(i) represents the completion time of task i, and i\u2192j indicates that task i must be completed before task j. For the cloud offloading problem on\nmobile terminals, processors can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Literature introduces a deterministic delayconstrained task segmentation algorithm based on dynamic programming, demonstrating its suboptimality. Considering the deadline constraints, the topology of DAG is not restricted, assuming processors can only handle one task at a time. Literature [5] presents a mixed-integer programming model considering collaboration between edge computing nodes and remote cloud nodes. This problem involves a general allocation problem with NP-hard characteristics, and there is currently no polynomial-time optimization method. Literature [6] utilizes relaxed integer programming model with 0-1 variables to convert the problem into a convex optimization problem, followed by the design of a heuristic approach. Addressing the multi-DAG mobile terminal offloading problem, literature [7] proposes a mixed-integer programming model to decide whether to upload tasks to the cloud and optimize energy consumption under deadline constraints.\n Heuristic Methods\nOptimization methods for DAG scheduling mainly include heuristic methods, intelligent algorithms, and hybrid algorithms, among which heuristic methods are primarily categorized into list scheduling, clustering, and task replication. List scheduling arranges tasks based on priority and selects the highest-priority task from the pending tasks for assignment to the appropriate processor. Clustering groups tasks until the number of categories equals the number of processors. Task replication involves duplicating tasks with significant data to multiple processors to reduce processing latency. In the \"cloud-edge-end\" system, literature [6] employs forward ranking as the criterion for list scheduling to optimize the computation, communication costs, and latency of cloud and edge computing nodes. Considering both deadline and cost, literature [7] employs methods such as lower bound estimation to allocate deadlines and compute nodes to DAG subtasks. Referring to the order of task deadlines, literature [8] allocates virtual machines based on the earliest completion time of tasks to optimize overall time performance.\n Intelligent Algorithms\nDistinct from heuristic rules, intelligent algorithms aim for global optimization performance. Literature [8] utilizes genetic algorithms to optimize task-edge node group assignments. Probability is employed by literature [9] to characterize the positional relationship between tasks. After DAG pre-segmentation based on heuristic methods, literature [9] utilizes bivariate correlation distribution estimation algorithms to rank tasks and optimize overall application completion time and edge node energy consumption. In literature [10], Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is employed to optimize total delay considering task deadline information. For the task-node assignment problem, literature [10] applies particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize weighted objectives of cost and completion time.\nOverall, the above methodologies are logically aligned with the actual requirements of cloud computing resource allocation and task scheduling.\nIII.

            "text": "Initially, the task size is set to 10, with cloud computing resources consisting of 10 VMs. Each VM has a storage size of 10 GB, memory size of 256 MB, one CPU, and a bandwidth of 1,000 MB. The unit time bandwidth cost and unit time instruction cost are 0.01 yuan/s each. Tasks are experimented with in increments of 10. The quality of service for the algorithm is represented by multiQoS. The resource load rate is defined as follows:\n(9) The average time cost for each algorithm is calculated as the number of tasks increases by 10. The results are depicted in Figure 1. It's observed that the time cost of GAACO is superior to that of ACO, albeit longer than SA. Moreover, as the number of tasks increases, the time gap widens, with GAACO reducing time by 50.9% compared to ACO and showing a 3% difference compared to SA. Thus, the author's algorithm outperforms ACO in terms of time cost, albeit with a slight difference compared to SA. The cost of each algorithm under the condition of different number of tasks is shown in Figure 3. The number of tasks is increased by a multiple of 10. It can be seen that the difference between algorithms is not large, and the average cost is only about 1%.\nThe experimental results of service quality of each algorithm are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the service quality of the author's algorithm and SA increases slowly with the increase of the number of tasks, while ACO presents a linear and sharp rise. Service quality is a comprehensive index of\ncost, time and reliability, and it can be seen that the comprehensive performance of GAACO is better than that of ACO and SA. They reduced by 14.4% and 76.8%, respectively.\nThe experimental results regarding the algorithm's system load are presented in Figure 4. It's evident that the system load of ACO has consistently remained high, whereas GAACO exhibits a higher load compared to SA but is notably superior to ACO. Specifically, GAACO achieves a 50.2% reduction in average system load compared to ACO. Furthermore, in conjunction with Figures 2 and 3, it's observed that SA tends towards an evenly distributed task assignment to virtual machines, resulting in a system load of 0 as per equation (9). However, effective cloud computing task scheduling necessitates a balance between cost, time, and reliability, as reflected in QoS. Therefore, the author's proposed algorithm better aligns with customer requirements during the actual scheduling process."
