Optimization of Biochar Additive Dosages: Investigate the optimal dosage of biochar additives for different types of anaerobic digestion feedstocks to enhance biogas production without inhibiting microbial activity. This research could include exploring the effects of varying biochar dosages on methane yield, process stability, and microbial community dynamics across different operational scales and feedstock compositions.

Biochar Surface Modification Techniques: Develop and evaluate novel surface modification techniques for biochar to improve its properties as an additive in anaerobic digestion processes. This could involve chemical, thermal, or physical modifications aimed at increasing biochar's porosity, surface area, and functional groups to enhance microbial interaction and biogas yield.

Impact of Biochar on Microbial Community Structure and Function: Conduct in-depth studies on how biochar addition affects the structure and function of microbial communities involved in anaerobic digestion. This research should focus on identifying shifts in microbial populations, examining the role of biochar in promoting or inhibiting specific microbial pathways, and understanding the implications for biogas production efficiency and stability.

Development of Biochar-based Composite Additives: Explore the development of composite additives that combine biochar with other materials (e.g., metal oxides, nanomaterials) to mitigate negative effects and enhance biogas production. These studies could investigate how combining biochar with specific materials impacts anaerobic digestion performance, including effects on pH regulation, nutrient balance, and contaminant adsorption.

Lifecycle Assessment of Biochar Use in Anaerobic Digestion: Perform comprehensive lifecycle assessments (LCAs) of using biochar as an additive in anaerobic digestion systems. This research would evaluate the environmental, economic, and social impacts of biochar production from various feedstocks, its use in biogas plants, and the potential for biochar to contribute to the circular economy. Studies could also assess the overall sustainability of biochar use in biogas production, including potential trade-offs and benefits across different scales of operation.
