    "abstractText": "As scientists, we ask questions of the world we live in. We ask questions about our biosphere, flora and fauna, and look for answers. However, how often do we question ourselves, checking the veracity of the narratives we tell ourselves? Every now and then, we come across an article that challenges us to think about our practice as biologists, and all the social and cultural interactions that entails. The Perspective article by Hird et al. (2023) in this issue of Journal of Experimental Biology puts forward propositions and questions that are thought provoking and confronting, but also require our consideration and attention. In Hird et al. (2023), four early-career Indigenous scholars from Australia, the USA and Aotearoa New Zealand provide insights on the representation of Indigenous voices, knowledges and practice in biological sciences. The writing of this article was initiated through informal discussions between Craig Franklin and Coen Hird, a trawlwoolway pakana and a PhD student in Franklin\u2019s lab, together with Franklin\u2019s former research student, Vincent van Uitregt, of Ma \u0304ori (Ngaa Rauru, Te \u0100tihaunui-a-P\u0101pa \u0304rangi, Nga \u0304i T\u016bhoe) descent. Their aim, as nicely summarised in the abstract, is to provide advice and reflections for the scientific community so that more nuanced strategies can be developed to support Indigenous academics and where Indigenous knowledges and practice can mesh with settler-colonial scientific traditions. The Perspective is likely to be viewed by some as provocative, but the messages it conveys are underpinned by the principles of inclusivity and respect. We hope that this article makes our JEB community pause and ask: do we really work within our belief in the values of diversity and inclusion, and can we do better? Reading Hird et al. (2023) should make us question how often we have conducted research \u2018On Country\u2019, on Indigenous lands, without asking or consulting the traditional owners. Have we asked for their extensive knowledge of the animal in their habitat and taken that view into account? We should recognise the benefits inherent in seeking answers from a viewpoint which is refreshingly different from our own traditional, cultural way of looking at science; theirs is an approach of study based on thousands of years of observation and understanding. Given that many JEB authors conduct fieldwork, potentially on Indigenous lands, it might be appropriate to consider that our study animals may be of considerable cultural significance (totem and sacred animals). How do we respectfully engage and acknowledge the traditional owners and their beliefs? It could be time to consider our responsibilities. In reading this Perspective, we might for the first time give some thought to the unique and sometimes invidious position our young Indigenous researchers are placed in: they must navigate the ingrained processes of our academic culture while still respecting their own tradition and culture. There are many positives that can come from engaging with and supporting Indigenous scientists, including the sharing of important local knowledge, exploring new ways to look at questions and discovering better ways to manage natural systems. Comparative physiologists are also likely to share similar motivations with Indigenous biologists, especially our love and respect for the natural world and a desire to learn more and to protect it. This year, we are celebrating the centenary of JEB and the journal is moving forward. In the next century, we must ensure that we consider diverse perspectives and are open to understanding our authors and readers. JEB should encourage exploration and consideration of errors of the past and present in order to propel scientific research. In responding to Hird et al. (2023), as a community we need to: look to our emerging cohort of Indigenous researchers; listen and collaborate with them to provide constructive guidance on how to move forward; and ensure we support our Indigenous scholars in developing best practices for collaborative data collection, while accepting an all-embracing, wider view of our research questions and of our science. As an initial step, JEB commits to including the cultural identities of authors and pertinent information about the Indigenous names and knowledges of study animals and their habitats.",
