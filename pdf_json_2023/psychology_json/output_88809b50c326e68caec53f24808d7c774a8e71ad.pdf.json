    "abstractText": "The rapid identification and recognition of COVID-19 have been challenging since its outbreak. Multiple methods were developed to realize fast monitoring early to prevent and control the pandemic. In addition, it is difficult and unrealistic to apply the actual virus to study and research because of the highly infectious and pathogenic SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the virus-like models were designed and produced to replace the original virus as bio-threats. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy were employed for differentiation and recognition among the produced bio-threats and other viruses, proteins, and bacteria. Combined with PCA and LDA analysis, the identification of the models for SARS-CoV-2 was achieved, reaching a correction of 88.9% and 96.3% after cross-validation, respectively. This idea might provide a possible pattern for detecting and controlling SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of combining optics and algorithms, which could be applied in the early-warning system against COVID-19 or other bio-threats in the future.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has lasted almost three years worldwide since its outbreak in late 2019, affecting all aspects of our lives and activities. And it could be the most severe threat for generations due to its dangerousness and unpredictability [1]. Great efforts have been made to understand and discover SARS-CoV-2, including its viral structure [2\u20134], spread process [5\u20138], pathogenesis mechanism [9,10], diagnostic approach [8], variants [11\u201313], and vaccine immunity [13\u201315]. However, there are still significant challenges in the detection of this virus despite all kinds of positive scientific progress have been achieved. After all, an accurate and rapid distinguishment plays an important role in preventing and containing the epidemic. Moreover, early warning and identification of bio-threats is the priority of protection. Considering the operability and timeliness of the technology, detections including sequencing, real-time PCR [16\u201318], loop-mediated isothermal amplification technology (LAMP) [17,19\u201321], droplet digital PCR technology [22], and CRISPR diagnosis [23] have all been developed. Meanwhile, technologies based on serological detection have also performed a significant part in the diagnosis, especially the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunochromatography (LFIA), which have also been often compared to each other to obtain a better sensitivity [24\u201327]. However, Methods based on PCR analysis are currently expensive and low-throughput, sometimes resulting in false-negative cases due to procedural or technical problems. Highquality antisera are often required for ELISA techniques, etc. [28]. Most importantly, these methods are destructive to samples. Therefore, it is still a challenge to develop a rapid identification method for SARS-CoV-2.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3209. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24043209 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3209 2 of 15\nSpectroscopy is a practical approach for detecting different kinds of viruses [29]; it is vital in bioengineering, natural sciences, environmental monitoring, and medical research. Especially, spectroscopy combined with algorithm analysis can be an effective way to determine the target molecules\u2019 presence. The regular steps for the diagnosis of COVID-19 through spectroscopy could be summarized as follows: (1) collection of specimens from nasopharyngeal or oral swab; (2) preparation of the samples and analysis by spectroscopy such as Raman, infrared, and fluorescence; (3) algorithm applied based on the spectral results; (4) target molecules differentiating from the control samples after statistical analysis. A previous study has proposed a method for detecting COVID-19 by Raman spectroscopy [30]. They analyzed and discriminant against the samples from blood serum by coupling Raman spectroscopy and principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) with 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity, indicating a possible rapid detection for COVID-19. Apart from that, Sanchez et al. proposed the possibility of detecting spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy to replace RT-PCR due to a significant signature of the virus could be obtained [31]. Besides, the team of Barauna reported an onsite, rapid, reagentfree, and nondestructive method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and a generic algorithmlinear discriminant analysis (GA-LDA) algorithm, which could lead to a result of 95% for blind sensitivity and 89% for specificity [32]. Except for identifying and detecting SARSCoV-2, spectroscopy such as three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence could be used to classify different proteins [33]. Therefore, spectroscopy combined with machine learning has provided a promising future in detecting and diagnosing viruses such as COVID-19. The most commonly used algorithms for discriminating are principal component analysis (PCA) and Linear discriminant analysis (LDA). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technology, especially in diverse areas [34]. It can simplify data sets by selecting or transforming them to fewer important variables, also known as principal components, through a linear transformation. This method can extract many original variables with specific correlations, perform feature extraction, and recombine them into a new set of independent and comprehensive indicators to replace the original ones, forming a new minority of variables (components). Using these new variables to replace the original data for subsequent processing, the higher-dimensional space problem can be transformed into a low-dimensional space for analysis [34]. This approach reduces the dimensionality of multivariate data systems and simplifies the statistical features of system variables. PCA has been used in materials and biochemistry areas based on spectra analysis, such as Raman spectra for nanoparticle characterization [35] and Raman spectra for Hepatitis C infection [36], indicating potential in description and screening study. LDA is also a dimensionality reduction technology, which can be concluded as focusing on classifying. When the number of classifications is known, it can be used to determine the category to which an unknown object belongs based on certain observational indicators of the classified objects. The discriminant analytic method needs first to classify the objects, further select some variables that can describe the observation objects more comprehensively, and then establish one or more discrimination functions according to certain discriminant criteria. For a case with an undetermined category, as long as it is substituted into the discrimination function, it can be judged which category it belongs to. The previous study has exhibited that LDA has been used in spectra analysis. Lv et al. proposed to use of LDA to classify freshwater fish species based on near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy [37]. Lin et al. reported a method for identifying osteonecrosis and normal tissue by combining near-infrared spectroscopy and LDA [38]. PCA and LDA both can perform dimensionality reduction on the data [39]. The difference is that LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction method with instructional values, while PCA is an unsupervised [39]. In addition to dimensionality reduction, LDA can also be used for classification. PCA aims to achieve dimensionality reduction by finding the linear combination with the largest variance of\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3209 3 of 15\nmultidimensional data. This method has an obvious influence on simplifying multidimensional data, but it is difficult to achieve effective distinction and distinguishment for similar data belonging to different species. LDA projects high-dimensional data into the best discriminant vector space to maximize the separability of samples in the new space to realize the effective extraction of the classification [39,40]. Therefore, PCA combined with LDA can complement each other and has the advantages of simple procedure and high efficiency. Ren et al. developed a method to recognize asphalt fingerprints based on ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and PCA-LDA analysis [41]. Besides, in the clinical area, PCA-LDA could be employed in diagnosing dental fluorosis with the help of micro-Raman spectroscopy [42]. Also, PCA-LDA could be regarded as a helpful analysis technology in forensic sciences to detect blood strain based on ATR-FTIR [43]. In summary, the combination of spectroscopy and algorithms has been a powerful tool in scientific research, including biochemistry, environment, and forensic studies. However, as for COVID-19, despite all the achievements, there is still limited research on developing a systematic pattern for the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 because the realistic factor, such as the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus, could not be solved. Moreover, although the distinguishment between SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV-2 was realized with an accuracy of 97.4% using complementary DNA and machine learning algorithms [44], the significant role of spectroscopy was neglected. Referring to our previous work [45], the virus-like model based on the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 was synthesized successfully to replace the original virus in some scientific research. Therefore, in this study, spike and nucleocapsid proteins were focused on producing the virus-like models by phage display, which were named Model-S and Model-N, on being substitutes for the bio-threats of COVID-19. After that, three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy were applied to the models and other selected samples for spectral analysis. Followed by the combination of PCA and LDA algorithms, a systematic process to identify and discriminant the virus-like models of COVID-19 was developed. The results from the two types of spectra could be compared. The idea and system may provide a method for actual SARS-CoV-2 detection and help to realize early monitoring for different kinds of bio-threats in the future."

Three-Dimensional Fluorescence Spectroscopy Analysis and Classification\n3DFS for the nine samples were shown in Supplementary Information S3. The fluo-\nrescence spectra, contour map, excitation spectra, and emission spectra were obtained\nfrom data preprocessing. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistics and the Bartlett test of\nsphericity were used to determine the suitability for PCA analysis. The KMO value is sup-\nposed to be between 0 and 1, and the larger it is, the more suitable for conducting the PCA\nalgorithm. Moreover, Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity hypothesizes that the coeffective correla-\ntion matrix is a unit. In this analysis, the KMO was tested as 0.724, and the significance\nvalue for Bartlett was 0.000, meaning the hypothesis was rejected. Moreover, there was a\nrelation between the variables, indicating it was suitable for PCA analysis.

Moreover, the two methods have been proven reliable through cross-validations with an accuracy of 88.9% and 96.3%, respectively. The correction from RS is slightly higher than that from the 3DFS. However, in 3DFS, misrecognition is among N protein, S2 protein, E. coli TG1, and OVA. The synthesized Model-N and Model-S could be separated directly. While in the analysis of RS, the two bio-threats could be recognized from the other samples, it is difficult to identify between them. To be specific, according to the cross-validation, there is a 33.3% probability of misidentification to Model-S for a sample of Model-N. It might cause problems when the individual model is studied. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 is investigated from a holistic perspective, Model-N and Model-S are both derivatives of it, and these models are supposed to imitate the actual viruses as bio-threats and regarded as a whole. Also, there were slight differences among the repeated measurement in 3DFS and RS for an individual sample. However, the overall identification and classification were not affected.

Rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein polyclonal antibody was used to coat a 96-well plate. Then, the produced Model-S was placed with different diluted ratios after washing and blocking the plates. After that, the Rabbit anti-M13 pAb-HRP was added and aimed to form a sandwich structure. Followed by the reaction with the TMB substrate, OD values at 450 nm were collected and analyzed to decide whether the Model-S could express the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.\n(2) Infection: titer determination\nIn order to estimate the infection ability of the virus-like model, the plaque assay was used to determine the titer of the produced Model-S since it is the gold standard for titer measurement. The displayed phages Model-S from different dilution ratios were employed to infect E. coli TG1. After that, LB solid culture media with kanamycin was applied to provide a space for cultivation. Moreover, the mixtures were cultivated at 37 \u25e6C overnight. The plates were collected, and all the plaques were counted to obtain the titer of Model-S the following day.\n(3) Affinity: molecular interaction assessment\nThe molecular interaction instrument ForteBio Octet K2 (SARTORIUS, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) was used to assess the combination between the produced Model-S and the corresponding anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody (Rabbit pAb). The interaction between these biomolecules could be monitored and collected through the shift of the probe surface reflection interference spectrum following the thin film interferometry technology. The process, including association, dissociation, and regeneration, was performed repeatedly according to the preprogramming. After the measurement, the association constant (ka)\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3209 12 of 15\nand dissociation constant (kd) were obtained. Moreover, the affinity constant could be calculated. After production and verification, the two virus-like models: Model-N [45] and ModelS, were prepared. Accompanied by these two models (as biothreats), M13 phage, bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin (OVA), commercial N protein, commercial S1 protein, commercial S2 protein, and E. coli TG1 were used as control samples for further study. All selected samples are related to the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. The produced Model-S and Model-N are the substitutions of SARS-CoV-2 in this research, which could be regarded as the combination of M13 phage (main body) and N/S protein (p3 site). The M13 phage used in the phage display to synthesize the models is a kind of virus that belongs to the virus family, as SARS-CoV-2 does. BSA and OVA are common proteins for scientific research. In addition, the N protein, S1 protein, and S2 protein are the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, as common pathogen types, both bacteria and viruses can cause the outbreak of large-scale infectious diseases. Thus, E. coli TG1 was also included for identification research since one of the hosts of the M13 phage is E. coli TG1, and it was also used to produce the models. Therefore, the nine selected samples are more or less related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The higher the relation between the sample and the SARS-CoV-2 virus (or its substitution), the more difficult it might be to distinguish. In general, the nine selected samples, including viruses, proteins, and bacteria, might be representative of the research. The recognition of the Model-S and Model-N among those related samples could provide a possibility for the nondestructive detection and identification of targeted biothreats. Therefore, the nine samples were prepared for spectroscopy analysis.\n4.2.3. Acquisition of the Three-Dimensional Fluorescence Spectroscopy (3DFS)\nThree-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3DFS) is currently a mature and widely used analysis method. It uses relative fluorescence intensity, excitation wavelength, and emission wavelength as three-dimensional coordinates, which can characterize the relative fluorescence intensity with the change of excitation and emission wavelength. The nine samples were scanned and analyzed in this study by an FLS1000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd., Livingston, UK). The measurements followed the protocol strictly. After approximately 30 min-preheat, the continuous xenon lamp was stable, and the samples were put into the equipment and ready to start the test. The spectra for every sample were collected at the range of excitation wavelength 240\u2013700 nm and emission wavelength 260\u2013720 nm with 5 nm increments. The experiments were all conducted under room temperature and normal humidity. All the samples were measured repeatedly (3 times), and every measurement lasted for about 20 min. The results were collected and prepared to perform statistical analysis.\n4.2.4. Acquisition of the Raman Spectroscopy (RS)\nRaman spectrometer analyzes samples qualitatively and quantitatively by detecting Raman scattered light. In this study, a DXR3 Raman spectrometer (ThermoFisher Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) tested and collected the Raman spectrum of the nine samples. The laser wavelength was 784 nm, and the laser power was 10 nW. The measurement was under the help of a 50\u00d7 objective lens. Moreover, the collection and pre-exposure times were 5 s, with ten times for every sample exposure. The range of Raman shift was selected between 555\u20133500 cm\u22121. The original data experienced smoothing and normalization for preprocessing to eliminate the influence of the background and noise. Moreover, for every sample, a triplicate spectrum was applied. All the data were collected and prepared for further analysis.\n4.2.5. Statistical Analysis and Algorithms Application\nData from 3DFS and RS were submitted to PCA. The entire spectra were used as the original dependent variables, and the nine selected samples were considered independent groups. PCA analysis was implemented to transfer the numerous variables into fewer\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3209 13 of 15\ninterrelated indicators, which are the principal component (PC). The scatter plot under PCs coordinates could be obtained. Secondly, the LDA method was applied with the selected PCs instead of the complete spectral information to classify the nine groups with the functions obtained. A comprehensive model with functions for identifying and discriminating the bio-threats was established. Then, cross-validation was employed to evaluate the performance of the constructed system. The data from 3DFS and RS were processed separately, and the results were compared to obtain a better distinguishment. All the data was processed by IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0"

            "text": "In summary, in order to provide a possible method for the identification of the high pathogenic virus SARS-CoV-2 apart from the traditional biological approaches, spectra analysis and algorithms were employed to realize the aim. First of all, virus-like models were synthesized by phage display technology based on the spike and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. These nonpathogenic models were prepared to replace the actual virus in research, avoiding physical and environmental safety problems. Then, the nine related samples, including the models, protein, virus, and bacteria, were selected for further distinguishment. Three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were applied to collect their spectral information. With the combination of algorithms PCA-LDA, the nine samples were separated, and the bio-threats (Model-N and Model-S) were identified successfully, with a correction of 88.9% (3DFS) and 96.3% (RS) after crossvalidation. The two approaches (3DFS and RS) were useful and reliable for identification. This study provided an idea to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of spectral algorithm analysis. Also, the study proposed a pattern for the research and recognition of the highly pathogenic virus by a non-intrusive method and nondestructive test, which may help to realize monitoring and control of the pandemic at an early stage.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24043209/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, investigation, and writing\u2014original draft, Y.W.; formal analysis, Z.L. and S.M.; supervision and funding, B.L.; project administration, Z.T.
