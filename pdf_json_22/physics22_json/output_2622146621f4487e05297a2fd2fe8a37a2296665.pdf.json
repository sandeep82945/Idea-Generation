    "abstractText": "Upon the UV light irradiation of single-crystal diamonds doped with phosphorus, several effects have been observed. The integral intensity of phosphorus lines in FTIR absorption spectra under UV radiation was increased. A saturation effect depending on the power of the laser radiation was demonstrated. Narrowing of the phosphorus lines, as well as the redistribution of the intensities in their doublets caused by the Jahn\u2013Teller distortion of the donor ground state, was observed. It was found that these effects are associated with the decompensation of the phosphorus donors. An easy, fast, sensitive, and nondestructive, fully optical method for the determination of the total phosphorus donor\u2019s concentration in semiconducting diamonds, as well as its compensation ratio, was proposed.",

            "text": "Currently, there is a need to create new materials for radiation-resistant, high-frequency, and high-power electronics, as well as for quantum information storage devices and deep ultraviolet (DUV) optoelectronics [1,2]. Diamond has several advantages, such as a wide band-gap (5.47 eV), high breakdown electric field (>10 MV/cm), high hole and electron mobilities (>2000 cm2/(V \u00d7 s)), and high thermal conductivity (22 W/(cm \u00d7 K)). For decades, diamond was considered to be a typical insulator due to the difficulties in doping it caused by electroactive impurities to control its conductivity. However, with the development of synthetic growth methods, such as the high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) gradient one [3\u20139] and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [10\u201321], it became possible to manage the content of impurities and the electrical properties of diamonds. Boron-doped p-type diamonds are fairly easy to produce [3\u20136,10\u201312]. However, for solid state physics and for the development of quantum computers, n-type diamonds doped with phosphorus are demanded [7\u20139,13\u201321]. The boron (B) acceptor level of 0.37 eV above the valence band maximum and the phosphorus (P) donor level of 0.6 eV below the conduction band minimum are formed with the substitutional B or P incorporation into the diamond lattice. These B acceptor and P donor levels are relatively deep, with only \u223c0.2% of acceptor holes and \u223c0.001% of donor electrons being ionized at room temperature, limiting the operation of diamond-based electronic devices [22\u201325]. High phosphorus doping of diamond above ~1020 cm\u22123 reduces the activation energy by up to 0.027 or 0.05 eV [23,26]. Recently, the energy diagrams of the electronic levels of the even boron acceptor states and odd phosphorus donor states were studied in detail by electronic Raman scattering as well as by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) absorption, respectively [6,9]. The energylevel diagram of boron acceptor states shows the 2-meV spin\u2013orbit splitting of the 1s(A1) ground acceptor state into the 1s(p3/2) and 1s(p1/2) states and the ns (n = 2, 3, 4) exited acceptor states with their 4, 6, 8-meV spin\u2013orbit splitting, correspondingly. The 1s\u2192 ns\nMaterials 2022, 15, 9048. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15249048 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 9048 2 of 9\nelectronic transitions reveal the fine structure, consisting of three groups with four bands for the 1s\u2192 2,3s transitions and two bands for the 1s\u2192 4s transition [6]. In accordance with the FTIR absorption spectra, the transitions 1s\u2192 np\u00b1 and 1s\u2192 np0 (n = 2, 3, 4) are identified. The doublet structure of the electronic transitions 1s(B2, E)\u2192 2p\u00b1, 1s(B2, E)\u2192 4p0, 1s(B2, E)\u2192 3p\u00b1 and 1s(B2, E)\u2192 4p\u00b1 with a splitting of 1.05 meV was observed [9]. The reason for these doublet structures is the dynamic Jahn\u2013Teller effect, which splits the energy level of the 1s(T2) state in the Td symmetry into those of the 1s(B2) ground state and 1s(E) state in the D2d symmetry. Notably, the 1s(A1) ground boron acceptor state is singlet, while the 1s(T2) ground phosphorus donor state is triplet. One of the most important problems in the creation of electronic devices based on doped semiconducting diamonds is the determination of the total concentration of donors (ND) or acceptors (NA) and their spatial distribution in samples. Electrical methods (Hall effect study) show only the net concentration (ND-NA) of uncompensated charges and degree of compensation NA/ND. For these purposes, Hall measurements should be performed in a wide temperature range (up to full ionization of donors\u2014at least 1000 \u25e6C for P donors), requiring the formation of good ohmic contacts and a high-temperature vacuum chamber with electrical ports [18,24]. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) analysis is difficult to perform. Moreover, it only provides information about the total concentration of impurities in diamond, but not about the crystallographic positions of impurities in the diamond lattice. The SIMS technique is a destructive method and leaves surface craters of 150 \u00d7 150-\u00b5m2 and approximately 10 \u00b5m in depth. Moreover, diamond samples are small and should be placed in a large, flat, conductive matrix to perform measurements. For 10% accuracy of SIMS measurements, implanted standards are needed. The FTIR absorption optical method was proposed for the determination of the net (ND-NA) concentration of phosphorus donors or the net (NA-ND) concentration of boron acceptors in diamonds [24]. However, in the presented version (without active exposure to light), it did not take into an account the compensated impurities, and it is only suitable for the determination of the net-doping concentration. The cathodoluminescence spectroscopy measures the total dopant density, ND for n-type diamond or NA for p-type diamond [27]. In this paper, we report an increase in the intensity and a narrowing of the phosphorus lines in the IR absorption spectra of diamond samples doped by phosphorus upon their irradiation by a UV laser. The impact of the laser radiation power has also been investigated. On the basis of these observations, a method for the quantitative determination of the total phosphorus concentration in diamond, as well as of the compensation ratio, has been proposed. The n-type conductivity of phosphorus-doped diamond at room temperature can be highly limited due to the problem of compensation rather than by the donor concentration; therefore, measuring the ratio of compensated donors is important."

Fe-Al-C alloy (91:5:4 by wt. %) was used as the solvent metal. Aluminum was added to the solvent as the nitrogen getter. Highpurity (99.9995%) graphite was used as the carbon source. Amorphous phosphorus powder was added to the carbon source in two concentrations as the doping agent. Growth mixture was supplied with 2% and 10% atomic percent of amorphous phosphorus with respect to carbon amount. Synthetic diamond crystals with a (100) surface and approximately 0.5\u20130.6 mm across were used as a seed material. The temperature in the reaction cell during the growth run was directly measured by a Pt6%Rh\u2013Pt30%Rh thermocouple with accuracy \u00b12 \u25e6C. Two diamond plates with an edge of \u223c3 mm and thickness of 250 microns were cut with a laser from grown diamond crystals and then mechanically polished. In this work, we studied two P-doped single crystal diamond plates with concentrations of \u223c2 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123 (Ph14N2, see insert in Figure 1a) and \u223c1.1 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123 (Ph19P5N1, see\nMaterials 2022, 15, 9048 3 of 9\ninsert in Figure 1b), measured by SIMS with the uncertainty of 10%. The samples also contained trace concentrations of boron (\u223c1 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123), which entered uncontrollably from the growth environment (see Figure 1).\nThe crystalline perfection of P-doped single crystal diamond plates (Ph14N2 and Ph19P5N1) was characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra of the P-doped diamond plates were obtained using a homemade multichannel triple-stage spectrometer (a 0.5-m focal length double subtractive monochromator and a 1.2-m focal length spectrometer) with a 0.6 cm\u22121 spectral resolution. The 1332.5-cm\u22121 Raman peaks with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ~1.8 cm\u22121 were almost the same as that observed from the unstressed IIa-type single-crystal diamond and indicated the absence of strain in P-doped diamond plates. No defect-induced bands in the Raman spectra of our diamond plates with low phosphorus doping were observed in comparison with those of the highly P-doped films and the highly B-doped diamonds [20,28]."

While this increase was not significant in terms of the absolute value, it appeared more dramatic compared to sample Ph14N2: the difference line in the phosphorus range had a biconvex shape. This was due to the different spectral widths of the phosphorus absorption lines in the spectra of the sample without and with the influence of radiation. Interestingly, the spectral lines narrowed under irradiation.\nFigure 2. Transmission spectra of diamond sample Ph14N2 in the IR region (1800\u20134800 cm\u22121) at 10 (blue) and 300 K (red).

The observed increa e in the in ensity of the absorption lines of bot samples upon the UV la er ir diation of phosphorus-doped diamonds can be explai ed by the generation of excess free charges, which can transfer compensated pho phorus to a neutral state. The pres nce of t ese absorption lines can e explained by the electron transitions from t e ground to excited states of neutral phosphorus impurities [9]. Since only the neutral centers can absorb light and the compensated impurities remain ionized, the resulting spectral features appear only due to the net impurities |ND-NA| [24]. Since the compensated impurities do not participate in IR optical absorption, it has generally been accepted that IR absorption could not be used for total impurity determinations. Our study shows that exposure to UV irradiation makes it possible to change the states of compensated phosphorus centers and make them optically active. A similar situation was observed for silicon samples doped by phosphorus and boron upon irradiation with light [29\u201332]. In this case, pairs of electrons and holes are generated, which also fill unpopulated donor and acceptor levels [29,30]. This was also confirmed by a synchronous increase in the intensities of the electronic transitions of phosphorus and boron upon laser irradiation in our experiments.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 9048 5 of 9Materials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 10\nFigure 3.

An increase was registered in the intensities of all observed phosphorus lines, namely 4540 cm\u22121 (1s\u2192 2p\u00b1), 4570 cm\u22121 (1s\u2192 3p0), 4705 cm\u22121 (1s\u2192 3p\u00b1), 4755 cm\u22121 (1s \u2192 4p\u00b1). The inset in Figure 5 shows the dependence of the integral intensity of the lines at 4540, 4705 and 4755 cm\u22121 on the laser power (0\u201380 mW). It can be seen that the intensity of the lines reach saturation in the region of around 35 mW. The line width does not increase from 35 mW up to 80 mW, indicating that possible radiation-induced heating does not affect the results. The most intense phosphorus transition lines have a doublet structure, with a distance between the doublets of 8.5 cm\u22121, and are better resolved under laser irradiation, which is associated with the effect of a light-driven decrease in the line width. It was previously shown [9] that the doublet structure is associated with the dynamic Jahn\u2013Teller effect, which splits the basic level 1s(T2) of phosphorus. The line narrowing under laser irradiation leads, in particular, to the observation of a biconvex line shape in the difference spectrum (Figure 4). It occurs due to the reduction in the Stark effect during the decompensation of ionized doping impurities. Similar observations of an increased intensity and narrowed lines were previously described when single-crystal silicon doped with electroactive impurities was irradiated with light [29].

Our studies show that not all phosphorus impurities are involved in the optical absorption. The compensated impurities are ionized and do not absorb light in the IR spectral region. To obtain the total concentration, it is proposed to irradiate the sample cooled to cryogenic temperatures (10 K) by UV light. It is necessary to increase the UV radiation intensity until saturation of the decompensation effect is reached. The most convenient line for analysis is a doublet at 4540 cm\u22121. The integral intensity I4540 [cm\u22122] of this line under UV light irradiation is then calculated and the phosphorus concentration NP [cm\u22123] is calculated using the following equation:\nNP = I4540 \u00d7AP (1)\nwhere AP [cm\u22121] is a correction factor. Using the correction factor AP from work [24] (AP = 2.7 \u00d7 1014 for 10 K measurements), we found both the total and net concentration of phosphorus, for both samples studied (see Table 1). As can be seen, a strong compensation ratio (68%) of donor phosphorus is observed for the sample Ph14N2, which is associated with the presence of a significant relative concentration of boron, along with a low concentration of phosphorus. For the Ph19P5N1 sample, a significantly lower compensation of donor phosphorus (13%) was observed. However, it can be seen from Table 1 that the concentration of acceptor impurities (boron) in these two diamond samples was at the same level, approximately 1.5 \u00d7 1016, which is consistent with the SIMS analysis (see Figure 1). Comparison of our SIMS and FTIR analyses shows that all phosphorus atoms in the studied samples occupied the substitution position, since the optically measured total concentration of the phosphorus under UV laser irradiation was in good agreement with the values measured using SIMS. In addition, apparently, the boron is the main decompensating impurity for phosphorus, since the number of compensated phosphorus donors was found to be equal to the concentration of boron acceptors, in accordance with the SIMS analysis (see Figure 1).\nMaterials 2022, 15, 9048 8 of 9"

            "text": "In this work, we have observed the effect of an increase in the intensity and a decrease in the half-width of the lines of electronic transitions of phosphorus impurities in diamond upon 266-nm laser irradiation. We have shown that the increased line intensity is associated with the decompensation of donors by the UV radiation near the diamond absorption edge, since the compensated donors and acceptors are ionized and do not participate in the IR absorption. Line narrowing occurs due to a decrease in the internal Stark effect, since ionized donors and acceptors in diamond are neutralized by laser action, and their effect on the electrical disorder in a diamond crystal disappears. We have demonstrated that the observed decompensation effect can be successfully used as a convenient method for the determination of both the total concentration and the compensation ratio of phosphorus centers in semiconducting diamond. The provided method is fully optical, nondestructive and does not require complex sample preparation, while being easy to perform and possessing high sensitivity (detection limit lower than 1015 cm\u22123).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.B.; methodology, K.B.; validation, S.K., V.D. and S.T.
