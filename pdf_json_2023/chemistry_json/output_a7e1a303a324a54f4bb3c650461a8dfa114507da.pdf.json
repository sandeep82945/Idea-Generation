    "abstractText": "Gelsemium is a medicinal plant that has been used to treat various diseases, but it is also well-known for its high toxicity. Complex alkaloids are considered the main poisonous components in Gelsemium. However, the toxic mechanism of Gelsemium remains ambiguous. In this work, network pharmacology and experimental verification were combined to systematically explore the specific mechanism of Gelsemium toxicity. The alkaloid compounds and candidate targets of Gelsemium, as well as related targets of excitotoxicity, were collected from public databases. The crucial targets were determined by constructing a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to explore the bioprocesses and signaling pathways involved in the excitotoxicity corresponding to alkaloids in Gelsemium. Then, the binding affinity between the main poisonous alkaloids and key targets was verified by molecular docking. Finally, animal experiments were conducted to further evaluate the potential mechanisms of Gelsemium toxicity. A total of 85 alkaloids in Gelsemium associated with 214 excitotoxicity-related targets were predicted by network pharmacology. Functional analysis showed that the toxicity of Gelsemium was mainly related to the protein phosphorylation reaction and plasma membrane function. There were also 164 pathways involved in the toxic mechanism, such as the calcium signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. Molecular docking showed that alkaloids have high affinity with core targets, including MAPK3, SRC, MAPK1, NMDAR2B and NMDAR2A. In addition, the difference of binding affinity may be the basis of toxicity differences among different alkaloids. Humantenirine showed significant sex differences, and the LD50 values of female and male mice were 0.071 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 and 0.149 mg\u00b7kg\u22121, respectively. Furthermore, we found that N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), a specific NMDA receptor agonist, could significantly increase the survival rate of acute humantenirine-poisoned mice. The results also show that humantenirine could upregulate the phosphorylation level of MAPK3/1 and decrease ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential in hippocampal tissue, while NMDA could rescue humantenirine-induced excitotoxicity by restoring the function of mitochondria. This study revealed the toxic components and potential toxic mechanism of Gelsemium. These findings provide a theoretical basis for further study of the toxic mechanism of Gelsemium and potential therapeutic strategies for Gelsemium poisoning.",

            "text": "Gelsemium, a genus of the Loganiaceae family, comprises three species: the Asian Gelsemium elegans (Gardner and Chapm.) Benth. and two North American related species, Gelsemium sempervirens (L.) J.St.-Hil. and Gelsemium rankinii Small [1]. Gelsemium elegans, as\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 195. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13020195 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 195 2 of 18\na traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat skin disorders, malignant tumors and pain for a long time [2,3]. Gelsemium sempervirens is used in homeopathy to treat anxiety, neuralgia, migraine and spastic diseases [4,5]. Due to their variety and high biological activity, alkaloids are considered to be the main active substances in Gelsemium. According to the characteristics of chemical structure, alkaloids can be divided into six types: the gelsedine type, gelsemine type, humantenine type, koumine type, sarpagine type and yohimbane type [3,5]. The toxicity of different alkaloids is greatly different, and gelsedine-type and humantenine-type alkaloids are the most toxic in Gelsemium. The LD50 of these two types of alkaloids for intraperitoneal injection in mice are usually lower than 1 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 [6,7]. There are many cases of Gelsemium poisoning, some of which have even led to death [8,9], which seriously limits its application. Mechanistic studies for Gelsemium toxicity are scarce at present. A few studies have reported that the toxicity of Gelsemium is closely related to gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAR) [10,11] and glycine receptors [12]. Recently, a phosphoproteomics study revealed that an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity signaling pathway is linked to the death of gelsenicine (one of the toxic alkaloids in Gelsemium) poisoning [13]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the toxicity of Gelsemium is associated with excitotoxicity, which is consistent with the typical symptoms of Gelsemium poisoning, including dyspnea and convulsions. However, most of the existing studies on the toxicity of Gelsemium are still imperfect and the specific reasons for the toxicity differences among different alkaloids are still unclear. Network pharmacology [14], a burgeoning interdisciplinary subject, highlights comprehensive thinking, focuses on the interaction among drugs, targets and diseases, and takes advantage of various means and technologies, such as molecular docking [15] and enrichment analysis [16], to screen the active ingredients, explore the potential core targets, and reveal the mechanisms of drugs. Network pharmacology is widely used in research to reveal the molecular mechanism of various drugs and poisons [17], and the reliability and accuracy of the technical methods used have been recognized by international standards. In the present study, we used the network pharmacology method to find the possible targets of Gelsemium toxicity, and used the molecular docking method to verify the binding affinity of Gelsemium alkaloids with these core targets. Finally, an acute poisoning model of humantenirine in mice was established to further reveal the potential toxic mechanism of Gelsemium. This study is expected to lay a theoretical basis for the development and utilization of Gelsemium."

(Chengdu, China) with a batch number of MUST-21052807 and purity of 98.4%. ICR mice (18\u201322 g) were provided by Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Changsha, China). The mice were reared in a standard facility. The animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Hunan Agricultural University (batch number 2020\u201343). The mice were randomly divided into 5 female groups and 5 male groups (n = 5). Humantenirine was injected into female mice intraperitoneally at 0.045, 0.056, 0.069, 0.086 and 0.11 mg\u00b7kg\u22121. Male mice were given humantenirine by intraperitoneal injection at doses of 0.1, 0.12, 0.13, 0.16 and 0.18 mg\u00b7kg\u22121. After administration, the poisoning symptoms and mortality were observed for 14 consecutive days. Finally, the lethal dose (LD50) was assessed by the Bliss method.\n2.9.2. The Antidotic Effect of NMDA on Humantenirine Poisoning\nA total of 20 female mice were randomly assigned to two groups: the control group and the NMDA group (n = 10). In the control group, humantenirine, at a dose of 0.11 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 according to the 100% lethal dose we explored earlier, was injected intraperitoneally into mice. The mice in the NMDA group were injected with 25 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 NMDA intraperitoneally 20 min before humantenirine injection. The dose of NMDA used in the experiment was based on our previous exploration. Then, the death of the mice in the two groups was recorded.\n2.9.3. Drug Treatment and Sample Collection\nFemale mice were randomly assigned to three groups: (A) the control group, (B) the humantenirine group and (C) the NMDA group. The mice in group A were intraperitoneally injected with a certain volume of normal saline and then sacrificed. The brain tissue was removed on ice. The mice in group B received an intraperitoneal injection of humantenirine (0.11 mg\u00b7kg\u22121). The brain tissues of poisoned dead mice were collected. NMDA (25 mg\u00b7kg\u22121) was initially administered to the mice in group C, and humantenirine was given after 20 min. After the mice recovered, they were decapitated, and brain tissue was collected. The hippocampal tissue was separated on ice from the brain tissue of three randomly selected mice in each group for protein expression determination, while the hippocampal tissue of the other mice was prepared for the detection of ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential.\nMeasurement of ATP Content in the Hippocampal Tissue of Mice\nThe hippocampal tissue samples were adequately homogenized with cold ATP extract solution after weighing. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8000\u00d7 g/min at 4 \u25e6C for 10 min. Then, 0.5 mL chloroform was added to the supernatant, and the well-mixed solution was centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u25e6C for 3 min. The supernatant was collected and used for the detection of ATP content according to the ATP Assay Kit.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 195 5 of 18\nDetermination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential\nThe hippocampal tissues were weighed and homogenized with precooled lysis buffer (1:10, w/v). After centrifugation at 1000\u00d7 g/min at 4 \u25e6C for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 1000\u00d7 g/min at 4 \u25e6C for 5 min. Then, the supernatant was transferred to another 2 mL microfuge tube and centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7 g/min for 10 min. Next, 0.5 mL wash buffer was added to mitochondrial pellets to resuspend, and then centrifuged at 4 \u25e6C and 1000\u00d7 g for 5 min. Finally, the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7 g/min for 10 min. The obtained mitochondrial pellets were suspended in store buffer. The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by using a JC-1 fluorescent probe. The mitochondrial suspension (20 \u00b5L) was added to 180 \u00b5L of JC-1 staining working solution (diluted 5 times with JC-1 staining buffer solution). The fluorescence intensity was detected by a fluorescence microplate reader. The excitation wavelength and emission wavelength of J-aggregates (red) were set to 525 nm and 590 nm, respectively. The excitation wavelength and emission wavelength of the JC-1 monomer (green) were set to 490 nm and 530 nm, respectively. The relative ratio of red/green fluorescence intensity was calculated to measure the proportion of mitochondrial depolarization.\nDetection of the Expression of Key Protein in Mice Hippocampus by Western Blotting\nThe collected hippocampus samples were weighed and homogenized with RIPA lysis Buffer (Solarbio, China) containing phosphatase inhibitor (Coolaber, China) at low temperature, then lysed in an ice bath for 30 min. Next, the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 \u25e6C for 10 min, and the supernatant was kept. The protein concentration was measured by BCA protein assay kit (CWBIO, China), and the protein samples were stored at \u221280 \u25e6C until use. The protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Then, the membrane was blocked with protein-free rapid blocking buffer on a shaker for 10 min and washed with TBST 3 times, each time for 8 min. The membrane was incubated with the primary antibody (p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (137F5) Rabbit mAb, 1:1000, Cell Signaling; Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk 1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) Rabbit mAb, 1:1000, Cell Signaling; \u03b2-Tubulin rabbit pAb, 1:4000, Proteintech) overnight at 4 \u25e6C. After washing with TBST, the appropriate secondary antibody (HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), 1:5000, Biodragon) was added to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with TBST again, the BLT GelView 6000 Pro imaging system was used to visualize the protein bands."

With a confidence score > 0.7, the PPI network was composed of 214 nodes and 1233 edges (Figure 2a). The nodes represent proteins, while the edges represent protein\u2013protein interactions. The hub targets with higher Degree, ClosenessCentrality and BetweennessCentrality values were speculated to be the key targets (Table 2), namely, MAPK3, SRC and MAPK1 (Figure 2b).\nTable 2.

MAPK3 and MAPK1 are the core members of the MAPK family, which play crucial roles in the signal transduction cascade by regulating various cellular processes. T e activation of ERK 1/2 can regulate the activity of NMDA r ceptors by ffecting the release of glutamate from synaptosomes, which le ds to epilepsy [28\u201331]. NMDAR i involved in excitotoxicity and neuronal death under any pathological conditions [32,33]. Treatment with a specific ERK inhibitor can dramatically reduce neuronal cell death induced by excitotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo [34]. SRC belongs to the SRC family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, is expressed in the central nervous system, and participates in many cellular functions. In the developed\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 195 14 of 18\ncentral nervous system, SRC can regulate the activities of NMDAR [35], Ca2+ voltage-gated ion channels [36] and GABAAR [37,38], which have been proven to be closely related to the toxicity of Gelsemium [10,13,39]. A previous study showed that lithium had neuroprotective effects against excitotoxicity by regulating the levels of phosphorylated SRC in vitro [40]. In conclusion, it is suggested that Gelsemium alkaloids may cause toxic reactions by regulating the activity or phosphorylation of these key targets. This has laid a foundation for further study of the toxic mechanism of Gelsemium and the discovery of specific antidotes in the future. To better understand the complex toxic mechanism of Gelsemium from a systematic point of view, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the 214 alkaloids corresponding to the excitotoxicity targets were performed. Based on GO functional analysis, it is speculated that Gelsemium may cause toxicity by affecting the protein phosphorylation reaction, ATP binding process and plasma membrane function. Protein phosphorylation is a transient post-translational modification that plays an important role in cellular regulation. Most of the aforementioned targets are phosphorylated during activation. For instance, phosphorylated SRC kinase at Tyr416 mediates excitotoxicity [40]. Interestingly, Gelsemium affects the phosphorylation of kinases and glutamate receptors, which leads to excitotoxicity [13]. The excitotoxicity elicited by direct exposure to glutamate or other excitotoxic compounds leads to prolonged calcium influx and depolarization of both the cell membrane and mitochondrial membrane [41,42], which is compatible with the results of KEGG enrichment analysis. Additionally, the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highly enriched the Ca2+ signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. Ca2+ is a ubiquitous intracellular signal that can regulate cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis and other biological processes. NMDAR possesses a high permeability to sodium and calcium [43]. The continuous increase in glutamate content leads to the overactivation of NMDARs, which promotes the continuous influx of Ca2+ into neurons [42]. Subsequently, Ca2+ can activate catabolic enzymes that directly cause cell death and tissue damage [44]. In addition, persistent Ca2+ influx depletes ATP stores and impairs mitochondrial function, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and contributing to apoptotic cell death. In addition, previous studies have proven that removal of extracellular calcium could decrease neuronal degeneration induced by excitotoxicity [45]. Ca2+ will also affect the release of neurotransmitters [46], which is consistent with our hypothesis that the toxicity of Gelsemium derived from the imbalance between neurotransmitters [47]. As for the MAPK signaling pathway, this is another important pathway enriched by KEGG. p38 MAPK signaling plays a key role in NMDAR-mediated apoptosis in striatal neurons [48]. Furthermore, it has been reported that Gelsemium can regulate the MAPK signaling pathway in piglets [49]. These findings improve our understanding of the toxic mechanism of Gelsemium. Based on the \u201calkaloid\u2013target\u2013pathway\u201d network, 85 Gelsemium alkaloids associated with excitotoxicity were obtained, including 19\u03b1-hydroxygelsamydine, gelseiridone, 14-dehydroxygelsefuranidine, gelselenidine, humantenirine and gelsemolenine B. The combination of these components may lead to the toxicity of Gelsemium. The molecular docking results show that 11 alkaloids could autonomously combine with the active pocket of MAPK3, SRC, MAPK1, NMDAR2B and NMDAR2A through hydrogen bonds and form a relatively stable complex. Among these, 19\u03b1-hydroxygelsamydine has the lowest binding energies and the highest affinity to these key targets, which indicates that 19\u03b1hydroxygelsamydine was the most toxic potential alkaloid in Gelsemium. At the same time, we found that the binding energies of alkaloids with low LD50 values, such as gelsenicine and 14-hydroxygelsenicine, to key targets were generally lower than those of alkaloids with high LD50 values, including gelsemine, koumine and koumidine (the LD50 values of Gelsemium alkaloids are shown in Table S5). These findings partly reflect the way in which the difference of binding affinity may be the basis of toxicity differences of Gelsemium alkaloids. By analyzing the combination modes of different complexes, it was found that the existence of methoxy and carbonyl groups on the indole nucleus of the more toxic alkaloids, such as humantendine, gelsenicine, 14-hydroxygelsenicine and humantenirine,\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 195 15 of 18\nincreased the possibility of hydrogen bonding with the target proteins, which increased the affinity between the ligand and receptor. This result is closely related to a previous report that the methoxy group at N1 is the structural basis of Gelsemium toxicity [50]. Furthermore, the binding energy of alkaloids with NMDAR2B was generally lower than that with NMDAR2A, indicating that Gelsemium alkaloids had a stronger affinity for NMDAR2B. This is consistent with previous research, which showed that the stimulation of NMDAR containing the N2B subunit will lead to the activation of the excitotoxic pathway that leads to neuron death instead of NMDAR containing the N2A subunit [51]. Taken together, these findings indicate that Gelsemium may regulate the function of NMDAR by acting on MAPK3, SRC and MAPK1 targets or by directly binding to NMDAR. Although 19\u03b1-hydroxygelsamydine showed specific toxicity potential in network pharmacology, it is not the most abundant of the alkaloids in Gelsemium. As it is difficult to obtain, there is no report on its toxicity. At present, it has been found that the extracts and monomers derived from Gelsemium possess potential toxicity, and the toxicity of gelsenicine (0.185 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 i.p.) [6,39], 14-hydroxygelsenicine (0.295 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 p.o.) [10], humantendine (0.21 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 i.p.) [7] and gelsemine (56.2 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 i.p.) [5] have been well characterized, while the toxicity of humantenirine is still ambiguous. Therefore, humantenirine was chosen as a substitute, based on its relative accessibility, to evaluate both the toxicity and the toxic mechanism in the experimental verification. In the current study, the acute toxicity of humantenirine was investigated in mice to further verify the results of network pharmacology. After intraperitoneal injection of humantenirine, mice developed symptoms of respiratory depression and convulsion and died within 30 min. Furthermore, humantenirine showed significant sex differences, and the LD50 values of female and male mice were 0.071 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 and 0.149 mg\u00b7kg\u22121, respectively. By analyzing the LD50 of different alkaloids, we found that humantenirine is a highly toxic alkaloid, and its toxicity is equivalent to that of gelsenicine, an alkaloid of gelsedine-type with strong toxicity. In our previous study, we found that excitotoxicity was crucial to the toxicity of gelsenicine and that NMDA (a specific NMDAR agonist) could protect against gelsenicine poisoning [13]. In addition, evidence has shown that NMDA can protect neurons against excitotoxicity by regulating extracellular glutamate concentrations and maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis [52,53]. Therefore, the detoxification of NMDA in humantenirine poisoning was evaluated. The survival curve showed that NMDA pretreatment could significantly improve the survival rate of humantenirine-poisoned mice. This may further indicate that the toxicity of Gelsemium was caused by excitotoxicity. Some studies have shown that excitotoxicity could lead to mitochondrial damage [54,55], which is consistent with experimental results that show that humantenirine could significantly decrease ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential in hippocampal tissue, the key brain region of Gelsemium toxicity, in mice. Recently, it has been shown that the level of phosphorylated ERK could be increased in glutamate-induced excitotoxicity [56]. Furthermore, protection with MAPK/ERK kinase specific inhibitor in both HT22 cells and immature primary cultured cortical neurons could inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation against oxidative stress, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration [57] as well as in the specific inhibitor against oxidative glutamate toxicity in HT22 cells [58]. Our experimental results suggest that humantenirine upregulates the phosphorylation level of MAPK3/1, causing excitotoxicity and then mitochondrial dysfunction. As for the detoxification of NMDA, we speculate that this was related to the recovery of mitochondrial function in some way, instead of inhibiting the phosphorylation of MAPK3/1. Although SRC has not been studied here, we cannot rule out the idea that it plays an important role in the toxicity of Gelsemium. Based on the similarity of clinical poisoning symptoms and skeletal structure, it is reasonable to speculate that humantenirine, or other alkaloid monomers derived from Gelsemium, may act on some excitotoxicity-related targets, leading to overactivation of NMDARs, which in turn leads to mitochondrial dysfunction of hippocampus and death of mice, but further in-depth research on its mechanism is needed.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 195 16 of 18"

            "text": "This study integrated a series of bioinformatic methods with experimental verification to systematically explore the toxic mechanism of Gelsemium. We have demonstrated that Gelsemium alkaloids may induce excitotoxicity by regulating the phosphorylation levels of key targets such as MAPK3 and MAPK1, thus causing mitochondrial dysfunction and leading to death. However, NMDA rescued humantenirine-induced excitotoxicity by restoring the function of mitochondria rather than inhibiting the phosphorylation of MAPK3/1. The present study is helpful in expanding the understanding of the toxic mechanism of Gelsemium and lays the foundation for its development and utilization. Our research further shows that the combination of network pharmacological analysis and experimental verification may provide a favorable means to elucidate the mechanism of action of drugs.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo13020195/s1, Table S1: The information of the alkaloids in Gelsemium; Table S2: The predicted targets of Gelsemium alkaloids; Table S3: The targets related to excitotoxicity; Table S4: The GO analysis of 214 intersective targets based on the P-value < 0.01; Table S5: The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of 214 intersective targets based on the P-value < 0.01; Table S6: Acute toxicity of humantenirine in ICR male and female mice; Table S7: The LD50 of Gelsemium alkaloids in mice.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.-Y.L.; methodology, X.-J.Q.; software, X.-J.Q.; validation, C.-Y.H., M.-T.Z. and M.-D.G.; formal analysis, X.-J.Q.; investigation, S.-J.H.; resources, Z.-Y.L.; data curation, X.-J.Q.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, X.-J.Q.; writing\u2014review and editing, Z.-Y.L.; visualization, M.-H.T.; supervision, Z.-Y.L.; project administration, Z.-Y.L.; funding acquisition, Z.-Y.L.
