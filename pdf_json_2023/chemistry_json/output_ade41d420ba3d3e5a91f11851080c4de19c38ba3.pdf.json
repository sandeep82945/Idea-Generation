    "abstractText": "A pioneering robust and green heterogeneous acidic catalyst (CSA@g\u2010C3N4) was rationally designed via immobilization of camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) on the g\u2010C3N4 surface under mild conditions. Grafting CSA in the g\u2010C3N4 lattice is distinguished as the root cause of facilitating the structure change of g\u2010C3N4, leading to a unique morphology, accordingly the remarkable catalytic efficiency of CSA@g\u2010 C3N4. The morphology of new as\u2010prepared nano\u2010catalyst was specified by means of FT\u2010IR, XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, TGA, and BET. For the first time, it is exhibited that the efficient catalyst CSA@g\u2010 C3N4 can productively accomplish the three\u2010component reactions with high yields and also serve as an inspiration for easily performing various sorts of MCRs based on our finding. The recommended synthesis pathway of chromenes derivatives is facile and cost\u2010effective which applies a condensation reaction of salicylaldehyde, thiophenol, and malononitrile followed by ready purification in a benign manner. Moreover, the CSA@g\u2010C3N4 nanocomposite can be promptly reused, illustrating no sensational decrease in the catalytic activity after ten times.",

Grafting CSA in the g\u2011C3N4 lattice is distinguished as the root cause of facilitating the structure change of g\u2011C3N4, leading to a unique morphology, accordingly the remarkable catalytic efficiency of CSA@g\u2011 C3N4. The morphology of new as\u2011prepared nano\u2011catalyst was specified by means of FT\u2011IR, XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, TGA, and BET. For the first time, it is exhibited that the efficient catalyst CSA@g\u2011 C3N4 can productively accomplish the three\u2011component reactions with high yields and also serve as an inspiration for easily performing various sorts of MCRs based on our finding. The recommended synthesis pathway of chromenes derivatives is facile and cost\u2011effective which applies a condensation reaction of salicylaldehyde, thiophenol, and malononitrile followed by ready purification in a benign manner. Moreover, the CSA@g\u2011C3N4 nanocomposite can be promptly reused, illustrating no sensational decrease in the catalytic activity after ten times.\nToday, solid acid catalysts have earned pervasive notice in organic synthesis as well as transformation. Since, they are non-toxic, chemically stable, non-corrosive, economical, highly selective, considerably active, and reusable with no depletion in activity, which can also be easily operated under the mild reaction conditions followed by a simple separation process1\u20133. Moreover, acidity classification either Br\u00f8nsted or Lewis, the acidic site potency and accessibility, alongside support specification concerning porosity, surface area, and thermal and chemical stability, are counted as key parameters affecting the solid acid catalysts traits and efficiencies. Thereby, the performance of the catalysts can be promoted via exploiting an appropriate support4, 5.\nMore specially, the benign and green catalyst of graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is of extensive attention due to some potential attributes6\u201311. In addition, g-C3N4 seems to be a prime candidate in selective organic transformation as catalysts ascribed to its exclusive features and low cost12\u201317. A satisfactory approach to increase the surface area would be the fabrication of mesoporous carbon nitride via assigning pores within the scaffold. This happens by employing various types of templates in which emerging number of problems is inevitable. In other words, withdrawing hard templates cause non-environmental attributes, and deploying soft templates leads to undesired residuals into the g-C3N4 construction18\u201322. In other trials by scientists, porous carbon nitrides with the escalated surface area have been manufactured without utilizing templates as outlined in the following. For that reason, acid treatment of the bulk g-C3N4 or even consuming other materials, precursors pretreatment as another procedure have become promising trends for creating porous structure23\u201327. Notably, multi polyhydroxyl arrangements of the sulfonic groups could adjust spreading the electrons on the surface of the catalyst, which expedites the half-reactions of electrons28. On the side of recent concerns regarding environmental issues, metalfree organocatalysts can be the opportune recommendation. Another fascinating substance for being applied in several organic transformations, including multicomponent reactions, is camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) as a productive, non-hazardous, affordable, benign, commercially accessible, and soluble in water Br\u00f8nsted acid catalyst29, 30.\nModern organic chemistry has put a specific focus on identifying new synthetic procedures to expedite the formation of organic compounds. To meet this challenge, the establishment of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) is regarded as a worthwhile approach applied to the production of complex molecules through executing several stages in a single process31, 32. Accordingly, MCRs play a leading role in the synthesis of various key heterocyclic\nOPEN\nChemistry and Chemical Engineering Research Center of Iran, P.O. Box 14335-186, Tehran, Iran. *email: Saber.

Additionally, chromene moiety is frequently spotted as a crucial constructional unit either in biologically active or natural materials, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, anthocyanins plus tocopherols. More precisely, one of the most critical uses of functionally substituted chromene can be synthesizing compounds with the potential to be exploited in the medicinal chemistry branch33\u201341.\nThe application of solid acid catalysts in various areas has grabbed scientists\u2019 attention in recent years as if it has become an attractive field42\u201344. On the other hand, the synthesis of chromene compounds employing diverse methodologies, including the use of acid catalysts or other methods, has been discussed in various articles in recent years. Hence, these reports have tried to express that developing a new reaction route for fabricating novel chemical compounds with different molecular constructions is of remarkable value in chemistry plus biology areas. Accordingly, developing approaches in which cost-effective catalysts along with more moderate conditions of reaction can be exploited has grabbed ascending attention in synthesizing structurally different frameworks. In this context, Lewis acids such as Al(OTf)3 or FeCl3 and a less toxic solid acid p-TSA catalyst as a Br\u00f8nsted Acid have been used for the chemoselective synthesis of 4H-chromenes. In a comparison based on the recorded reports, it can be concluded that, in general, the use of Br\u00f8nsted acids as a catalyst rather than Lewis acids increases the yield of products in addition to a significant decrease in the reaction time for chromene production45\u201347. One of the recently mentioned solid acid catalysts is MNPs\u2022GO-CysA, which has been effective in the one-pot synthesis of 4H-chromene scaffolds from three components48. In this regard, nanostructured carbon compounds have raised tremendous interest in authentic documents around nanomaterials owing to promising qualities, such as low price, air stability, and corrosion resistance to be deployed in various chemical as well as industrial operations. Among other catalysts from a category of carbon compounds (graphene oxide) that have been explored for synthesizing 4H-chromene derivatives, Fe3O4\u2010supported sulfonated graphene oxide and the piperazine immobilized on the graphene oxide surface can be pointed out49, 50. Among other classes of new catalysts for chromene synthesis, MOFs should also be taken into consideration. Furthermore, heterogeneous solid acid catalyst systems, on the basis of metal organic frameworks, could be achieved by introducing acid sites on the MOF surface via chemical modifications, for example, Fe3O4@UiO@DAS51. In another case, the use of various Fe3O4-based hydrotalcites acting as acid\u2013base bifunctional catalysts was stated to synthesize different 4H-chromene derivatives by a three-component reaction52. To gain the potential advantages of applying multifunctional catalysts in MCRs along with designing productive and green approaches in organic synthesis as a part of our research prospect, it can even be referred to the reports in which methods other than utilizing solid acid catalysts have been used for chromene synthesis. In this framework, agricultural wastes as an alternative source for toxic and dangerous catalysts for the environment have shown the capability to serve as green catalysts due to their ease of biodegradability. Moreover, water extract of pomegranate peel ash (WEPPA), water extract of lemon fruit shell ash (WELFSA), and Water extract of mango peel ash (WEMPA) are some examples of natural aqueous medium catalysts that have participated in producing 4H-chromene derivatives through the multicomponent reactions under exposure to microwave in recent years53\u201355. In an engaging report, multi-component reactions in combination with photocatalytic processes for 4H-chromene synthesizing have been investigated56. Additionally, green electrocatalytic multicomponent synthesis has been studied as another technique of 4H-chromenes production, exploiting potassium iodide as an electrolyte in undivided cell, which production yields of 86% have been reported57. Furthermore, ionic liquids have demonstrated an extensive domain of applications as either promoters or reaction medium in the case of multi-component reactions. In the last few years, a number of procedures employing various sorts of ionic liquids have been introduced to gain 4H-chromene derivatives58. Multicomponent reactions (MCR) provision deep knowledge regarding 4H-chromene formation. Furthermore, considerable catalytic schemes have evolved over recent years for the multicomponent synthesis of 4H-chromene derivatives, including RGO-SO3H59, GO/\u03b1-Fe2O3/CuL60, MNPs@Cu61, g-C3N462, Pd@g-C3N463, CaMgFe2O464, morpholine65, CAEDA66, mica/Fe3O467, amino grafted MOFs68, DABCO69, Fe3O4@Sal@Cu70, Fe3O4@GO-NH71, KCC-1@NH272, Nano-SiO273, SnO2 NPs74, Ag2O/GO/TiO275, and borax76. Yet, there are several drawbacks concerning plenty of expressed catalysts, including environmental contamination, high price, challenging catalyst removal, and requiring coarse reaction conditions. There are still tremendous requests for designing more practical, facile, benign, and efficient methods to synthesize these classifications of heterocyclic compounds ascribed to their prominence and expansive application.\nAs-mentioned valuable traits of chromenes derivatives act as incentives to develop productive and environmentally friendly procedures for 4H-chromenes framework synthesis employing CSA@g-C3N4. We have been prompted to prepare a novel heterogeneous catalyst via surface modification of g-C3N4 using camphorsulfonic acid for the first time. This protocol supports the impacts of green chemistry in synthesizing the chromenes derivatives through a three-component reaction while utilizing acid to accelerate catalytic activity at the same time."

Besides, the weight of the nano-catalyst quickly declined in the temperature ranged from 125 to 440\u00a0\u00b0C owing to the remaining polyhydroxy components in the CSA@g-C3N4. Moreover, the significant endothermal peak could be seen in the range of 150 to 500\u00a0\u00b0C owing to the -SO3H groups thermal decomposition, which leads to the mild decline in weight, equals to 3.65%.

In agreement with TGA results, the notable thermal stability of CSA@g-C3N4 was specified which vividly depicts its safe application in organic reactions when the temperature is high84. According to the literature85, 86, the content of CSA on the g-C3N4 can be calculated via the TGA curve. As can be seen, 0.22% of primary weight loss is related to the loss of physically adsorbed water. In the following, the second weight change of 3.65 wt% is relevant to the slow mass loss of -SO3H groups, which exist in CSA. Subsequently, because of the high temperature, g-C3N4 was totally decomposed or sublimated; hence, the mass percentage reached 53.69% at this stage. It can be deduced that the remaining compound was CSA, and a value of 42.44% was observed for the residual weight fraction without accounting the -SO3H groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that the CSA amount in the porous CSA@g-C3N4 nanocomposites would be equal to 46.09%."

Additionally, the total acidity of the CSA@gC3N4 catalyst equals 1124.9\u00a0\u00b5mol/g, which has dramatically increased compared to the pure g-C3N4. It should be taken into account that the root cause of the strong Br\u00f8nsted acidity related to the nano-catalyst of CSA-treated g-C3N4 is the attendance of considerable density of acid sites on the g-C3N4 surface brought by -SO3H groups, which was certified by the NH3-TPD, as demonstrated in Table\u00a01.\nEvaluation of CSA@g\u2011C3N4 activity for the synthesis of 4H\u2011chromenes derivatives via the one\u2011step multicomponent approach A single-pot reaction produces a product via a combination of three reactants or more containing structural features of every applied reagent, all these happen in a process known as MCR. In this work, MCRs merits, such as selectivity and possessing atom economy have been exploited for chromene formation, which plays a leading role in modern synthetic procedures. The topic of this study is the employment of a powerful catalyst for developing MCRs where the absence of a catalyst would trigger not performing the reaction efficiently. According to our captivation in organic synthesis, also being inspired by our previous works focusing on heterocyclic chemistry synthesis; a remarkable output was given, introducing salicylaldehyde as an easy substrate. Therefore, a facile approach was launched in this project for straightforward synthesizing of 4H-chromenes derivatives in a onepot polymerization, containing salicylaldehyde, malononitrile, various nucleophiles such as thiols, and amines, with employing the catalyst of CSA@g-C3N4 with pleasant yields under mild conditions at room temperature.\nAn appropriate support material for non-metal incorporation on the active sites can be graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), having a configuration similar to graphite to improve the catalytic activity. Accordingly, the CSA doped g-C3N4 was productively synthesized to upgrade the catalytic performance for three-component reaction in the path of chromene production, decreasing the reaction time, promoting the yield of the reaction, and extending the of ratio product manufactured as well. Along the lines of this strategy, the model reaction between salicylaldehyde, malononitrile, and thiophenol was delved into the assessment of the most optimum reaction condition. It should be note that several solvents such as ethanol (C2H5OH), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), glycerol (C3H8O3), acetonitrile (CH3CN), water (H2O), ethyl acetate (CH3CO2Et), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethylformamide (DMF) were utilized in this reaction.\nTable\u00a02 assesses the optimum conditions to determine the type as well as amount of catalyst and also the solvent type for achieving the highest efficiency. The pure g-C3N4 completed the regarded three-component reaction by the yield of 18% to synthesize chromene while CSA performed the reaction alone in 2\u00a0h by yield of 71% (Table\u00a02, Entries 13 and 14). The efficient catalyst of CSA@g-C3N4, which was synthesized for this work, outstandingly elevated the performance of the reaction. Different amounts of catalyst were examined to comprehend the most effective value. When the three-component reaction was conducted by salicylaldehyde, thiophenol and malononitrile without exploiting catalyst, the yield of 25% could be obtained for chromene production (Table\u00a02, Entry 5). Consequently, increasing the amount of catalyst was sensibly enhanced the performance of reaction with respect to results (Table\u00a02, Entries 1\u20134). To precisely study the reaction on path of seeking the most appropriate conditions, several protic and aprotic solvents were evaluated. The output was identifying ethanol as suitable solvent for three-component reaction of chromene production (Table\u00a02, Entries 1 and 6\u201312). The optimization results implies that the best efficiency of 92% for chromene synthesis associated with three-component reaction of salicylaldehyde, thiophenol and malononitrile was obtained by deploying 40\u00a0mg catalyst of CSA@g-C3N4 in ethanol (1\u00a0mL) as solvent after 2\u00a0h at 60\u00a0\u00b0C.\nTable\u00a03 compares the different catalysts of CSA@g-C3N4 that have been synthesized by different amounts of loading CSA on the surface of the g-C3N4 catalyst. Actually, 4H-chromenes synthesis was performed under the mentioned optimum conditions, where the only objective was searching for the optimum value of CSA for loading on the g-C3N4 surface. Ultimately, the results obtained from Table\u00a03 illustrated that the maximum efficiency would be gained for conducting the reaction by using 2\u00a0g of CSA is loaded on the g-C3N4 surface.\nDerived from the fascinating results, elucidating the efficient impact of the powerful catalyst of CSA@g-C3N4 on multicomponent reactions, it was decided to conduct an additional investigation by carrying out further reactions through different substituted salicylaldehyde with thiols under the expressed conditions. Table\u00a04 discusses about reactions between salicylaldehydes derivatives and several thiophenols in the presence of CSA@g-C3N4 catalyst. In this regard, salicylaldehydes with bromo as well as methoxy substitutions reacted with thiophenols such as thiophenol, para-bromothiophenol, para-methylthiophenol, para-methoxythiophenol, para-chlorothiophenol, and 2-naphthalenethiol at the temperature of 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 2 to 4\u00a0h. In such reactions, 4H-chromene derivatives can be gained by yields of 74% to 95% via both electron-rich salicylaldehyde, for example, 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde and electron-deficient salicylaldehyde, for instance, 5-bromosalicylaldehyde. Moreover, the results indicate the high efficiencies for all three-component reactions; it should be noted that applying 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde\nTable 1.

With this respect, mentioned aromatic thiols delivered chromene significant yields subjected to mild reaction conditions. Additionally, 2-naphthalenethiol illustrates a lower efficiency compared to thiophenol and thiophenols with substitutions in para position. Not only electron-withdrawing but also electron-donating substituent on the thiophenol showed any distinction in the selectivity as well as the reactivity of the reaction.\nIn continuation of gaining a better perceiving of the three-component reaction of chromene synthesis, when different nucleophiles, including secondary aliphatic amines, reacts with salicylaldehyde and malononitrile under the same reaction conditions, the generalization of this benign would obviously be approved. Moreover, a threecomponent condensation of salicylaldehyde, malononitrile, plus secondary amines undergoing the resembling reaction conditions was conducted to serve a quick approach to benzopyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine to emphasize the capacity of this environmentally friendly method. Table\u00a05 explores the synthesizing 4H-chromeno[2,3-d] pyrimidines derivatives attained via three-component reaction between salicylaldehyde, 5-bromosalicylaldehyde, and 3-methylsalicylaldehyde with malononitrile and diverse amines by the assistance of 40\u00a0mg CSA@g-C3N4 catalyst in existence of 3\u00a0mL ethanol as solvent at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 3 to 5\u00a0h. Likewise, secondary aliphatic amines, which include piperidine, 4-methylpiperidine, morpholine, pyrrolidine, and diethylamine experienced a three-component reaction, bringing about the promised product in excellent yields. This three-component reaction was readily and practically accomplished by exploiting the robust as-prepared catalyst at the temperature of 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The highest yield of 90% for producing 4H-chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine was acquired when salicylaldehyde\nTable 2.

The X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns attributed to the catalysts were gained from the AG D5000 tool (Siemens, Germany) to discern crystalline construction using Cu-K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.54\u00b0 A) as emission source. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized at 10\u00a0kV to determine the particle size of as-prepared catalyst. A scanning electron microscope apparatus (BAL-TEC SCD 005) was exploited. A helpful instrument of Energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was appointed to inspect the elemental distribution of synthesized catalyst implemented on an equipment model of MRIA3 TESCAN-XMU (Czechia). TEM images were recorded on a Philips EM 208S transmission electron microscope through the\u00a0accelerating voltage adjusted to 100\u00a0kV. TGA was carried out to approve the reliability of catalyst synthesis as well as the thermal stability, which conducts a STA504 instrument at the temperature span from 0 to 800\u00a0\u00b0C with the heating rate value of 5\u00a0\u00b0C min\u22121 subjected to air atmosphere. A BELSORP Mini II nitrogen adsorption apparatus was a proper methodology to calculate the nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm at 77\u00a0K with respect to the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) accompanying the pore factors of representative samples while degassing treatment was performed at the temperature of 200\u00a0\u00b0C. Additionally, pore size distribution was measured according to the N2 adsorption isotherm through applying the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) computational procedure based on the Halsey equation. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) procedure was conducted to assess the acidic characterization of the samples via an NS-93 (NanoSORD) model with a temperature span from 100 to 600\u00a0\u00b0C."

Subsequently, melamine by the value of 10\u00a0g was transferred to a furnace using a covered steel crucible to be subjected to 550\u00a0\u00b0C heating at a 5\u00a0\u00b0C/min heating rate for a time period of 3\u00a0h. After cooling off to room temperature, carbon nitride (g-C3N4) yellow powder was gained. Eventually, calcination of melamine would be completed. The bulk carbon nitride was conveyed to a furnace with a temperature set point of 550\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h to deliver nano-scale particles of graphitic carbon nitride."

            "text": "Novel catalyst of CSA@g-C3N4 introduced in this study embodies glaring traits such as high stability as well as non-toxicity accounted as a prime candidate for synthesizing chromenes through three-component reactions consisting of salicylaldehyde, thiophenol, and malononitrile. Incorporation of camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) into g-C3N4 is set to be a constructive and highly practical strategy for enabling immense catalytic activity along with providing simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and time-saving for conducting the process. The new organocatalyst of CSA@g-C3N4 was structured from low-price as well as straightforward substrates while removing metal to chase the goal of becoming a benign protocol through a mild organic transformation which is currently placed on the top dominant trends of both industry and academia. It was comprehended that the acidification of g-C3N4 brings about high yields in comparison with pure g-C3N4, entailing a facile purification after a mild and rapid reaction. The novel heterogeneous catalyst was identified via several methods, including FT-IR, XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, TGA, and BET. Additionally, this catalyst is recyclable after executing at least ten reaction cycles without any drop in catalytic performance, which can reach the development of a sustainable process."
