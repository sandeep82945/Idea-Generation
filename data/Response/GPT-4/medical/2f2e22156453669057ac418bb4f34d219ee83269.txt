Mechanisms of LFA-1 Activation to Intermediate-Affinity State: Investigate the specific signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that activate LFA-1 to the intermediate-affinity state on T cells. This includes identifying the intracellular and extracellular signals that trigger this activation state and how these signals are integrated at the molecular level. Understanding these mechanisms could provide insights into how T cells modulate their adhesion and signaling responses during migration and IS formation.

Role of LFA-1 in T-cell Effector Functions: Study the functional consequences of LFA-1 activation to its intermediate-affinity state on T-cell effector functions, including cytokine production, cytotoxicity, and helper functions. Research could focus on how different affinity states of LFA-1 influence T-cell activation and differentiation, and how these states contribute to T-cell responses in various immunological contexts, such as infection, inflammation, and autoimmunity.

LFA-1 and T-cell Migration Dynamics: Examine the role of LFA-1 in the dynamics of T-cell migration, focusing on how the intermediate-affinity state affects T-cell interactions with the endothelium, migration through the extracellular matrix, and entry into inflammatory sites or lymphoid tissues. Advanced imaging techniques could be used to visualize and quantify the impact of LFA-1 affinity states on T-cell motility, adhesion, and transmigration in real-time, under physiological flow conditions.

Therapeutic Targeting of LFA-1 Affinity States: Explore the therapeutic potential of selectively modulating LFA-1 affinity states to enhance or suppress T-cell responses for disease treatment. This could involve developing small molecules, antibodies, or other biologics that specifically target LFA-1 in its intermediate-affinity state to modulate T-cell adhesion and activation in diseases where T cells play a critical role, such as autoimmunity, transplantation, cancer, and chronic infections.

LFA-1 in Immunological Synapse Formation and Function: Investigate the specific contributions of LFA-1 in its intermediate-affinity state to the formation, structure, and function of the immunological synapse between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. This research could focus on how LFA-1-mediated adhesion and signaling at the IS influence T-cell receptor signaling, antigen recognition, and the initiation and maintenance of T-cell activation. Additionally, exploring the crosstalk between LFA-1 and other molecules within the synapse could reveal new insights into the regulation of T-cell responses.
