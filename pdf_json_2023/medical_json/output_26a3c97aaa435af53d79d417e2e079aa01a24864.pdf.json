View Article Online\nincredibly low dark current of 4.36 \u00d7 10\u221211 A was observed for the fabricated device. This considerable low dark current may be related to the Schottky barrier created by QDs at the interface due to which charge carriers are not able to overcome the barrier under dark and room temperature conditions. The photocurrent measurements of the device were obtained using a 514 nm laser with varying power levels. Under low illumination power (>0.48 mW), the open-circuit voltage (Voc) doesn't change much but as the illumination power increases to 0.56 mW, the Voc changes to +0.5 V indicating that the external applied voltage compensates for the built-in potential in the COF366-QD device. This observation is important since it shows that the embedded QDs in the COF layer play an effective role to harvest the visible-light energy and also act as an electron reservoir. Meanwhile, as the device was irradiated but no bias voltage applied, a small change in current is observed but as the illumination power increases to 0.56 mW, it is observed that the current increases to two orders of magnitude. However, as the bias voltage is applied in both forward and reverse bias, around 1.5 orders of magnitude of the current increase is observed for both bias regions, as the illumination power increases from 0.16 mW to 0.56 mW. Fig. 5d displays the enlarged section of the forward bias Region where the knee voltage in Region 1(0.5 to 1 V), Region 2 (1 V to 2 V), and Region 3 (2 V and above) condition was found to be 0.52 V, 1 V and 1.9 V respectively.

This inferences that as the external voltage is applied and change in photon ux from Region 1 to Region 3, more photogenerated charge carriers are created, increasing the overall conductance which implies the onset of a new charge carrier mechanism and is apparently visible from the knee voltage change from one Region to another. For low voltage Regions (Region 1 and 2), slope\u223c 6.27 indicates that the current observes the trap-controlled space charge limited conduction (SCLC) with the formation of a conduction path between the electrodes through a network of embedded QDs in the COF layer.\nTo attain further insight into the opto-electrical characteristics of the device, the power dependence of the photocurrent of the device with a 514 nm light source in reverse bias is shown in Fig. 6a. There is a steady increment in the photocurrent (Fig. 6a) while raising the incident light power up to 0.56 mW with no saturation. Meanwhile, it is also noteworthy that under \u22121 V and\u22123 V applied voltages, the current magnitude increase is much less compared to when higher voltages \u22127 V and \u221210 V are applied. It further conrms that when high voltages are applied, charge carriers from deep trap levels are pulled giving rise to higher magnitude of currents.

Here, Fig. 6b shows the power dependence of the photocurrent of the device at \u221210 V, and the value of responsivity is determined from the slope of Fig. 6b which is found to be 3.42 A W\u22121. To evaluate the responsive characteristics of the fabricated device, we further performed on-off switching experiments. The photocurrent response of the device was recorded under periodically chopped visible light at room temperature (Fig. 6c). The device showed a fast switch \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d response to light irradiation with a signicant increase in current as the biasing increased from 2 V (1.3\u00d7 10\u22126A) to 5 V (2.9\u00d7 10\u22126A) respectively. The switching response was very stable with very little variation as shown in Fig. 6c.

Thus, this device can be well utilized for high-incident power applications as a photonic sensor. Based on the above observations, the possible mechanisms in our COF366-QD thinlm based device can be illustrated by a simple schematic diagram Fig. 7a and b. The photocurrent generation mechanism of the COF366-QD photoactive layer can be expected as follows: (i) photocurrent generation at the COF/metal interface, (ii) light-induced charge carriers in the COF layer and QDs (iii) photocurrent generation due to traps in COF and trapped electrons in QDs. As the COF366-QD thin-lm absorbs the incident visible photons, they create electron\u2013hole pairs near the COF/Metal interface giving the instant photocurrent due to a smaller diffusion pathway between the adjacent metal electrodes. Further, the COF and QDs (away from the interface) also absorb incident photons and charge carriers of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of COF were excited to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and similarly, photogenerated charge carriers are produced in the QDs also. Under the effect of the internal electric eld, charge transfer between COF surface and QDs happens and the p\u2013p stacking facilitates the charge transfer through a conduction path formation by a network of embedded QDs between the electrodes. These charge carriers dri towards the metal electrodes leading to the photocurrent as depicted by the observed photocurrent under various power levels at zero bias. However, there may be several defects present on the COF as well as QDs\n3674 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 3669\u20133676\nsurface. The QDs are dispersed in the COF-366 layer in random order thus there is an energy barrier difference between COF LUMO and QD conduction band which assists the trapping of electrons in QDs. On absorption of visible photons, the electrons trapped in the COF, as well as QDs lower trap states, can be excited to higher trap states. These trapped electrons can move towards the metal electrode absorbing the visible photons under the built-in potential but the majority of them need externally applied bias voltage to move from the COFQD layer to the metal electrode. Previously, Yaghi and co-workers presented the linear I\u2013V prole of a 2 mm width Au gap with a pure COF-\ndevice under (a) zero bias and (b) bias condition.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

View Article Online 366 layer.54 The pure COF-366 layer shows linear current\u2013 voltage behavior and doesn't show any knee voltage characteristics.\nThus, it can be clearly inference that for our COF-366 with QDs based device, a clear rise in the current at the knee voltage observed in Regions 1, 2, and 3 proposes that as the bias voltage increases more and more trapped electrons from shallow and deep trap levels in the QDs are pulled by the bias voltage enhancing the overall current. However, as the applied voltage further increases (5 to 10 V), the trapped electrons are already being pulled from QDs and QDs trap states are probably empty, and thus saturation of the photocurrent is observed for higher voltages in forward as well as reverse bias Regions as seen in Fig. 5b. Thus, it can be understood that the QDs play a dominant role in the enhancement of the photocurrent of the COF366-QD layer in knee voltage regions due to the contribution of the added trapped electrons from QDs adding to the total current61,66,67"

            "text": "We have demonstrated a chemical vapor deposited COF366QDs thin lm device capable of responding to visible light illumination. FTIR and XPS studies show the formation of imine bonding in the thin-lm. Our structural studies of the deposited lm shows good crystalline porous framework of the COF layer along with mono-dispersed QDs with average size of about \u223c2.5\u20133 nm in diameter. The photoactivity of this device was investigated under 514 nm visible light illumination and found to exhibit a good photocurrent 1.54 \u00d7 10\u22126 A with 0.08 mW minimum power. The device shows good on/off switching response stability. The proposed in situ CVD deposited COF366QDs thin lm provides an easy fabrication technique for large area growth of this photoactive material for various device applications. Our photoresponse studies suggest that the fabricated device can be effortlessly used as a photonic sensor, optoelectronic device and on-chip device applications."
