We investigated strategic choice patterns during the classic two-player game, Matching Pennies, where the most efficient strategy is to choose each option randomly from trial-to-trial to avoid exploitation by one\u2019s opponent. Twenty-seven female adolescents with BPD (mean age: 16 years) and twenty-seven age-matched female controls (mean age: 16 years) participated in an experiment that explored the relationship between strategic choice behavior and impulsivity in both groups and emotional dysregulation in BPD. Relative to controls, BPD participants showed marginally fewer reinforcement learning biases, particularly decreased lose-shift biases, increased variability in reaction times (coefficient of variation; CV), and a greater percentage of anticipatory decisions. A subset of BPD participants with high levels of impulsivity showed higher overall reward rates, and greater modulation of reaction times by outcome, particularly following loss trials, relative to control and BPD participants with lower levels of impulsivity. Additionally, BPD participants with higher levels of emotional dysregulation showed marginally increased reward rate and increased entropy in choice patterns. Together, our preliminary results suggest that impulsivity and emotional dysregulation may contribute to variability in mixed-strategy decision-making in female adolescents with BPD.\nKeywords: Borderline Personality Disorder, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, neuroeconomics, mixedstrategy, adolescence\nINTRODUCTION\nBorderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by maladaptive decision-making tendencies, such as unstable relationships, self-harm behaviors, and substance use (for review, see Soloff et al., 2000; Dougherty et al., 2004; Rosval et al., 2006; Sebastian et al., 2014). Dimensional approaches propose that the symptoms of BPD reflect instantiations of an underlying\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 667399\npredisposition toward impulsivity (i.e., actions without forethought or deliberation; Paliwal et al., 2014), emotion dysregulation, and interpersonal dysfunction (Chapman et al., 2008; Hallquist and Pilkonis, 2012; Scott et al., 2014; Beeney et al., 2018; Hallquist et al., 2018; Allen and Hallquist, 2020), which are transdiagnostic processes that contribute to maladaptive behaviors across several personality pathologies (see Allen and Hallquist, 2020 for a review). Personality and related psychiatric disorders, including BPD, often emerge and intensify during the adolescent period (Johnson et al., 2000a,b; Larsen and Luna, 2018). However, due in part to extant controversy surrounding diagnoses of personality disorders in adolescence (Volker et al., 2008; Coffey et al., 2011; Chanen and McCutcheon, 2013; Barker et al., 2015; Berenson et al., 2016; Krause-Utz et al., 2016; Maraz et al., 2016, p. 201) and the continued reliance on categorical classifications in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; Trull and Durrett, 2005; Widiger and Simonsen, 2005; Clark, 2007; American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Allen and Hallquist, 2020), little is known about how BPD symptoms emerge within the context of brain maturation, hampering the ability to develop effective diagnostic, preventative, and early intervention strategies (Chanen et al., 2007; Kaess et al., 2014).\nAdolescence is a unique period of enhanced plasticity, marked by heightened risk-taking behaviors and impulsive decisions that can be adaptive (Spear, 2000), but can undermine survival and have adverse long-term consequences (e.g., risky sexual behavior, substance use, see Shulman et al., 2016 for review). Additionally, emotion regulation skills and strategies become refined through adolescence (Ochsner et al., 2012; Guassi Moreira et al., 2019). Contemporary models (Steinberg, 2010; Luna and Wright, 2016) conceptualize adolescent behavior as a normative peak in reward-driven and affective behaviors, which are adaptive for specializing the neurobiological pathways required for adultlike levels of cognitive and affective regulation (Spear, 2000; Luciana et al., 2012; Ochsner et al., 2012; Luna et al., 2015; Larsen and Luna, 2018; Guassi Moreira et al., 2019). Specifically these models propose a relative predominance of affective/reward systems over cognitive control systems (Shulman et al., 2016), biasing adolescent decision-making toward rewarding stimuli. Thus adolescence represents a period in which normative peaks in impulsivity and affective processing already undermine decision-making and cognitive control (Larsen and Luna, 2018), and aberrant developmental trajectories may contribute to the emergence of major psychopathologies during this period (Paus et al., 2008; Larsen and Luna, 2018). An increased propensity for impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors in adolescents with BPD can lead to adverse health outcomes (i.e., suicide and substance use; Kaess et al., 2014), and individuals diagnosed with BPD early in development may have more severe disease burden and poorer prognosis (Chanen et al., 2007; Kaess et al., 2014). Despite these findings, the majority of experimental studies concerning decision-making in BPD have been conducted in adults [a recent meta-analysis reported mean age of 27\u201330 years (Jeung et al., 2016; but see also Tay et al., 2017)], thus we know very little regarding the developmental pathways to dysfunctional decisionmaking in BPD (Kaess et al., 2014). We therefore focus on an\nadolescent cohort of BPD patients, with the aim of exploring how individual differences in impulsivity (that may be beyond the normative increases observed during adolescence) confer risk for maladaptive decision-making tendences in BPD.\nStudies in adults with BPD have pointed to altered valuation of expected outcomes (Paret et al., 2017) predominantly assessed using delay discounting tasks, which measure an individual\u2019s tendency toward immediate, short-term gratification, in addition to devaluation of long-term (delayed) rewards (Volker et al., 2008; Lawrence et al., 2010; Coffey et al., 2011; Barker et al., 2015; Berenson et al., 2016; Krause-Utz et al., 2016; Maraz et al., 2016; Lempert et al., 2019), reversal learning tasks (Berlin et al., 2005; Paret et al., 2016), and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Haaland and Landro, 2007; Minzenberg et al., 2008; Black et al., 2009; Schuermann et al., 2011; LeGris et al., 2012; Cackowski et al., 2014), although findings on the latter are mixed (McCloskey et al., 2009; Gorlyn et al., 2013; Paret et al., 2017). Increased trait impulsivity (Skodol et al., 2002; Bornovalova et al., 2005; Lawrence et al., 2010; Barker et al., 2015) has been shown to contribute to increased discounting rates in BPD (Volker et al., 2008; Lawrence et al., 2010; Coffey et al., 2011; Krause-Utz et al., 2016), and variability in decisionmaking in healthy individuals (Franken et al., 2008; Penolazzi et al., 2012; Raio et al., 2020), including risk-taking behavior in adolescents (Romer et al., 2009). Increased levels of emotional dysregulation in BPD (e.g., assessed using the difficulties in emotion regulation scale DERS; Gratz and Roemer, 2004), particularly with regard to lacking access to emotion regulation strategies and impulse control difficulties (Ibraheim et al., 2017), may lead to exacerbated impulsivity, particularly in the context of negative affect (Koenigsberg et al., 2001; Chapman et al., 2008; Peters et al., 2013; Sebastian et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2014; Krause-Utz et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2017; Hallquist et al., 2018). Although developmentally appropriate assessment tools (including self-report, parent report, interview, and clinician report) have recently been validated to assess dysfunction in childhood and adolescence (Sharp et al., 2012a; Fonagy et al., 2015; Sharp and Fonagy, 2015), few experimental tasks that are sensitive to the pathological processes of BPD have been optimized for developmental populations.\nMost tasks that have been used to probe decision-making in BPD have focused on processes involved during gambles with fixed outcomes and probabilities (i.e., gaining $1 immediately or $5 after some variable delay). Though these studies (as detailed above) have done much to advance our understanding of core decision-making deficits in BPD, and how BPD patients discount rewards according to their delays, these decisions are typically made in settings in which choices are independent of prior choices of the decision-maker and have consequences only for the decision-maker. In reality, decisions are rarely made in isolation and often made in highly complex social environments, which require a complex array of behaviors, the use of strategic tactics, and inference of the intentions of others (Lee, 2008), introducing a level of uncertainty in terms of value estimation. Neuroeconomic games that probe decision-making in ecologically valid (often interpersonal) contexts (Montague, 2007; Kishida et al., 2010; Hasler, 2012;\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 667399\nKing-Casas and Chiu, 2012; Sharp, 2012; Sharp et al., 2012a,b; Jeung et al., 2016; Robson et al., 2020) have revealed deficits in cooperative and trust behaviors in BPD, specifically related to perception of social norms and risk as compared to non-social risk (e.g., decisions involving fixed gambles; King-casas et al., 2008; Seres et al., 2009; Unoka et al., 2009; Franzen et al., 2011; Sharp, 2012; Preuss et al., 2016; Henco et al., 2020). Although these studies suggest changes in mentalization and cooperative decision-making processes in BPD, behavior during competitive interactions has not been investigated. Here, we explore how decisions made in a dynamic strategic context, which demands ongoing predictions of opponent\u2019s choice behavior, differ in adolescents with BPD and as a function of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation.\nDuring mixed-strategy games, such as rock-paper-scissors, each player\u2019s actions and their associated outcomes change dynamically based on their opponent\u2019s actions (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944; Seo and Lee, 2008; Vickery et al., 2011; Parr et al., 2020). On the one hand, it may be advantageous to adopt a mixed-strategy by choosing each of the three actions with equal frequency, but unpredictably from trial-to-trial. If both players do so, they approach the Nash equilibrium, and there is no incentive to deviate from this strategy unilaterally as departures could be exploited by their opponent (Nash, 1950; Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991). On the other hand, if one\u2019s opponent deviates from the Nash equilibrium (e.g., by displaying preferences for one action or the other and/or serial dependence in choice patterns), one can benefit by exploiting these predictabilities, engaging mentalization processes involved in inferring the actions and mental states of others (Hampton et al., 2008; Vickery et al., 2015). Generally, individuals approach the Nash equilibrium, however, systematic deviations consistently emerge in normative studies of strategic decision-making in humans (Mikulic\u0301 and Dorris, 2008; Vickery et al., 2011; Parr et al., 2020) and non-human primates (Barraclough et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004; Thevarajah et al., 2009). Specifically, the win-stay/lose-shift (WSLS) bias emerges, consistent with the use of reinforcement learning (RL) processes (Cohen and Ranganath, 2007; Hampton et al., 2008), in which individuals are more likely to repeat previously successful actions (rewarded) and switch away from previously unsuccessful (unrewarded or punished) actions (Barraclough et al., 2004; Thevarajah et al., 2009; Vickery et al., 2011). Theoretically, these RL biases would be exploited by one\u2019s opponent and result in decreased net gains, thus inhibition of RL biases is optimal, placing this task at odds with typical decision-making paradigms in which RL processes are adaptive for successful performance (i.e., the Iowa Gambling Task (Worthy et al., 2013); and multi-armed bandit tasks (Stojic et al., 2015). Mixed-strategy games engage limbic and affective systems in the brain (Sanfey et al., 2003; Dorris and Glimcher, 2004; Paulus et al., 2005; Seo and Lee, 2007; Seo et al., 2009; Vickery and Jiang, 2009; Abe and Lee, 2011; Vickery et al., 2011; Harl\u00e9 and Sanfey, 2012; Katahira et al., 2015; Parr et al., 2020), and involve frontolimbic networks that overlap with those implicated in BPD (Lyoo et al., 1998; Tebartz Van Elst et al., 2003; Silbersweig et al., 2007; P. Soloff et al., 2008; Ruocco et al., 2013; Schulze et al., 2016). Importantly, this paradigm is sensitive to several domains of\ndysfunction in BPD. First, Impulsivity, given its role in decisionmaking under uncertainty (Dickman, 1993; Zermatten et al., 2005; Paliwal et al., 2014; Chase et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2017), may play a role in learning and updating the value of available actions (action-outcome contingencies) that change dynamically based on reinforcement history and opponent\u2019s behaviors (Lee and Seo, 2007; Vickery et al., 2011). Second, emotional dysregulation, which has been shown to exacerbate impulsivity in BPD (Chapman et al., 2008; Sebastian et al., 2013; Neville et al., 2021), may play a role in integrating affective sources of information to update value representations (Paulus et al., 2005). Here, we characterize how individual differences in impulsivity and emotional dysregulation affect choice behavior during a mixed-strategy game in adolescents with BPD.\nGiven the novelty of this paradigm and the general lack of experimental findings in adolescent mixed-strategy decisionmaking and in adolescent BPD, this study was largely exploratory in nature. As a first-of-its kind study, we tested the possibility that BPD pathology could lead to either a detriment or a benefit to task performance. Pathological processes in BPD (namely, impulsivity and emotional dysregulation) could affect strategic choice behavior in several ways. Impaired affective and RL processes could contribute to strategic choice behavior through outcome evaluation processes including; (1) Blunted reward prediction error (RPE) and/or affective signaling (H\u00fcpen et al., 2020; Neville et al., 2021) that could lead to insensitivity to changing reward contingencies and/or a deficit updating the value of actions on a trial-by-trial basis, which in this context, may actually result in fewer choice biases (and therefore, potentially enhanced performance as one may better evade exploitation by the opponent); and/or (2) Exacerbated RPE and/or affective signals could lead to amplified biases (and therefore, potentially diminished performance as the opponent would exploit these biases as they emerge), either of which may be more prominent for either positive (WS) and/or negative (LS) outcomes (Schuermann et al., 2011; Paret et al., 2016; Neville et al., 2021). We hypothesized that group differences would be more pronounced in individuals with higher levels of impulsivity in either group, measured using the BIS (Patton et al., 1995), and emotion dysregulation in the BPD group, measured using the DERS (Gratz and Roemer, 2004). Impulsivity (Stanford et al., 2009) and emotional dysregulation (Gratz and Roemer, 2004) are multifaceted constructs, and differential patterns of associations among impulsivity and DERS subscales have been associated with distinct clinically relevant outcomes (Chapman et al., 2008; Neumann et al., 2010), including externalizing and internalizing characteristics in adolescents (Neumann et al., 2010). Because our study is novel and exploratory in nature, we first interrogated relationships at the level of total BIS and DERS scores, and then examine the contribution of each subscale to strategic choice behavior. Last, to gain insight into whether any observed changes are related to deliberative strategies (as opposed to nonstrategic randomness or noise, for example) we further conducted exploratory analyses to assess whether individual differences in self-report strategies contribute to the observed group differences in choice behavior and relationships between impulsivity (both groups) and difficulties in emotional regulation (BPD group).\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 667399"

All visual stimuli were presented and behavioral responses acquired using custom MATLAB v7.9 programs (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, United States) and Psychophysics Toolbox v3 (Brainard, 1996; Pelli, 1996) running on a PC. Visual stimuli were presented on an adjustable 17-inch LCD monitor at a screen resolution of 1280 \u00d7 1024 pixels that had a refresh rate of 60 Hz. At the beginning of each run, eye position was calibrated using a five-point calibration routine set to within 1\u25e6 of the visual target. Participants indicated their choices by making a saccadic eye movement that corresponded to the location of the desired visual target. Saccades were recorded if eye movement amplitude exceeded a 7.5\u25e6 fixation window. Eye tracking was used as it is very accurate and eye movements do not include any biomechanical lags that can impact limb motion.\nPerformance Variables The following behavioral variables were examined: (1) the probability of reward [p(rew)], which served as a proxy for overall task performance."

            "text": "In this article, we examined mixed-strategy decision-making in female adolescent outpatients diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). In particular, we investigated whether adolescents with BPD differed from age and sex matched control participants in their ability to engage in a strategic competition that encouraged randomization in choice patterns (i.e., suppressing choice biases), and whether two core features of BPD, impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, underscored individual differences in choice behavior. We found that the BPD patients as a group showed fewer win-stay, lose-shift (WSLS) biases (Figure 3), particularly lose-shift (LS) biases, increased variability in reaction times (CV; Figure 5A) and more anticipatory decisions (Figure 5B), despite having comparable reward rates (Figure 2A) relative to control participants. Critically, we found that a subset of BPD participants with high levels of impulsivity showed higher overall reward rates (Figure 2C) and greater modulation of reaction times by outcome (Figure 4C), particularly following loss trials, relative to control (Figures 2B, 4B) and BPD participants with lower levels of impulsivity. Additionally, BPD participants with higher levels of emotional dysregulation showed marginally increased reward rates (Figure 2D) and increased entropy in choice patterns (Figure 6B), which might be driven by increasing vigilance to outcome information during the task (Supplementary Figure 1). These results may suggest that adolescents with BPD show changes in choice behavior during Matching Pennies, and that\nimpulsivity and emotional dysregulation potentially contribute to variability in mixed-strategy decision-making in BPD."

            "text": "The finding that adolescents with BPD had a greater propensity for variability in reaction times (Figure 5A) and a greater number of anticipatory trials (Figure 5B) is in line with prior studies showing increased anticipatory decisions during a stop-signal delay task (Nigg et al., 2005; Coffey et al., 2011), and during the pro- and anti-saccade task (Calancie et al., in preparation) in BPD, and could be related to behavioral dis-inhibition (Nigg et al., 2005), although overall response times did not differ between groups (Table 3). Likewise, increased variability (also referred to as \u201cincreased noise\u201d in the literature) is a common observance across several psychological illnesses and personality psychopathologies (Willcutt et al., 2008; Peters and B\u00fcchel, 2011; Kunisato et al., 2012; Robinson and Chase, 2017), including BPD (Kaiser et al., 2008). The increased variation in response time variables in the BPD group could therefore reflect increased variability with emerging psychopathology, and also suggests that our task may be sensitive to known behavioral changes in BPD.\nWe also found reduced WSLS bias in BPD relative to controls, which was being driven by a decrease in LS bias (Figure 3A), which may have provided a benefit to Matching Pennies performance as the strategic nature of our task incentivizes entropy in choice behavior (i.e., fewer reinforcement learning biases) in order to evade exploitation by one\u2019s opponent (Rapoport and Budescu, 1992; Azar and Bar-Eli, 2011; Gauriot et al., 2016; Thaler, 2016). Despite this decrease in LS strategies, overall performance (as indicated by reward rates) was comparable among groups (Figure 2A), which is likely due to the wide array of choice biases and factors that could contribute to overall task performance (i.e., that could be exploited by the computerized opponent), the aggregate of which is reflected in overall reward rates. For example, although BPD participants showed decreased LS, they also showed increased CV and anticipatory decisions that appeared to considerably serve as a detriment to performance (Figure 6A). Further, the BPD group reported paying less attention to outcome information during the game (Supplementary Figure 1A), which was also associated with decreased reward rate. Thus, decreased LS may have partially counteracted the detrimental effects of increased CV, anticipatory choices, and reduced attention to outcome in BPD, resulting in comparable reward rates across groups.\nIn contrast to traditional decision-making paradigms, decreased LS biases served as adaptive during Matching Pennies. However, this reduced LS could be reflective, in part, of changes in limbic processes related to feedback processing (Goyer et al., 1994; Lyoo et al., 1998; Tebartz Van Elst et al., 2003; Silbersweig et al., 2007; Schuermann et al., 2011; Svaldi et al., 2012; Schulze et al., 2016; Paret et al., 2017), particularly with regard to outcome evaluation when a potential loss is present (de Bruijn et al., 2006; Vega et al., 2013; S\u00e1nchez-Navarro et al., 2014) and the ability to adjust behavior accordingly (de Bruijn et al., 2006; Vega et al., 2013). The reduced LS bias in\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 13 February 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 667399\nBPD observed in the current study could potentially indicate aberrant PE following negative outcomes, which may contribute to disadvantageous decision-making tendencies observed in BPD in other decision-making paradigms (de Bruijn et al., 2006; Haaland and Landro, 2007; Schuermann et al., 2011; Vega et al., 2013), although future work is needed to support this hypothesis. Likewise, the reduced bias could be linked to delay discounting findings in BPD (Volker et al., 2008; Lawrence et al., 2010; Coffey et al., 2011; Barker et al., 2015; Krause-Utz et al., 2016; Maraz et al., 2016), as faster discounting of reinforcers may manifest as fewer choice biases. Alternatively, the possibility exists that reduced LS could be related to a more deliberative strategy (i.e., suppression of choice biases in an attempt to be random) in the BPD participants. Interestingly, our exploratory analyses revealed a positive association between LS and the \u201chuman vs. computer\u201d item on the strategic questionnaire that assessed whether participants would approach the game differently if playing against a human opponent (Supplementary Figure 2B). Overall, while BPD patients and controls alike reported that they would indeed play differently against a human (Table 1), those who reported that they would approach the game similarly showed decreased LS biases. This finding, while exploratory and based on a post-game questionnaire, may provide evidence that individuals with BPD (who showed decreased LS biases as a group) potentially engaged different motivational processes that facilitated the suppression of choice biases and/or randomization over choice options in order to gain strategic advantage, in line with studies showing that knowledge of the task may contribute to variance in behavioral performance in BPD (Paret et al., 2017)."

            "text": "Impulsivity is a tendency to react to external stimuli, often quickly, without fully considering its consequences (Kim and Lee, 2011). We observed differential effects of impulsivity measures in Matching Pennies performance across groups; in the BPD group, higher levels of impulsivity, particularly cognitive instability and motor impulsivity, were associated with increased reward rate (Figure 2C), and greater modulation of SRT by outcome (Figure 4C), particularly unrewarded (loss) outcomes, in that higher levels of impulsivity were related to longer SRTs following loss trials. On the other hand, these measures were associated with little change among reward rates in control participants (Figure 2B), and we observed the opposite relationship with regard to SRTs following loss outcomes in control participants in that higher levels of impulsivity were instead related to shorter SRTs following loss trials (Figure 4B). Of note, longer SRTs following loss trials was correlated with increased reward rate in both groups (Figure 6A), and increased entropy in the BPD group (Figure 6A), suggesting that slowing down following a loss outcome may have served as a benefit to overall task performance. In particular, two subscales contributed to these findings: (1) BIS-Cognitive instability, which reflects instability in thought processes (see section \u201cResults\u201d for more detail; Patton et al., 1995; Stanford et al., 2009); and (2) BISMotor, which, despite being classified as impulsive responding in the motor domain, it is worth noting that it is also\ncomprised of several questions relating to impulsive spending behaviors (see section \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d for more detail; Patton et al., 1995; Stanford et al., 2009). Increased impulsivity may diminish the ability to track changing action-outcome contingencies (Kim and Lee, 2011), as has been seen in tasks assessing reinforcement/reversal learning in BPD (Paret et al., 2016, 2017). While this tendency may lead to dysfunction in real-world settings in BPD (Paret et al., 2017), during mixedstrategy games and other related strategic decision-making paradigms, increased behavioral variability (i.e., randomness) can be adaptive (Tervo et al., 2014), and increased impulsivity may therefore have had a facilitatory effect on the ability to produce unpredictable choice sequences. Though difficult to distinguish between \u201cnoise\u201d and randomness and strategic randomness, the observation that impulsivity was not related to either median SRTs or SRTs following rewarded trials but appeared to have a specific effect on SRTs following negative outcomes may suggest differential modulation of behavior in BPD participants with higher levels of impulsivity (rather than simply increased noise). In healthy individuals, increased impulsivity was associated with speeding up after a negative outcome, however, in BPD, the opposite pattern was observed whereby they slowed down after a negative outcome. BPD participants have been shown to have slower reaction times following negative stimuli relative to neutral [during an emotional stroop task; Arntz et al., 2000; Sieswerda et al., 2007a,b; Carpenter and Trull, 2012; Winter et al., 2015; Krause-Utz et al., 2018), which might be related to hypersensitivity to negative stimuli (Bertsch et al., 2018). Furthermore, impulsivity has been associated with post-error slowing and increased error related negativity (Hill et al., 2016). Our observation that higher levels of impulsivity in BPD were related to slowing down following unrewarded outcomes may be related to an increased expectancy of receiving punishments, and an adaptive/compensatory response to avoid them (i.e., to slow down; Hill et al., 2016), though future work is needed to assess this possibility.\nAlthough the divergent associations between BIS scores and choice behavior across groups observed in the current study was unexpected, a few potential (non-mutually exclusive) explanations exist for these discrepancies. First, BIS scores were significantly lower in control participants compared to BPD, and therefore, the lack of associations in the control group could indicate of a floor effect and may suggest that impulsivity levels are too low in this cohort to detect associations with decision-making behavior that might emerge with higher levels of impulsivity. On the other hand, it is possible that BPD participants with high levels of impulsivity may have developed compensatory decision-making strategies that were reflected during our task (i.e., reflected in the modulation of SRTs by negative outcomes; Paret et al., 2017). In addition, studies have shown the impulsivity may modulate ventral striatal responses to rewards differently in healthy individuals as compared to psychiatric populations, including BPD (Herbort et al., 2016). Whereas in healthy individuals, increased impulsivity was related to increased ventral striatal responses (Hariri et al., 2006; Forbes et al., 2009; Plichta and Scheres, 2014; Herbort et al., 2016), in patient groups such as substance use, ADHD, and BPD, impulsivity was related to decreased ventral striatal responses\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 14 February 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 667399\n(Beck et al., 2009; Plichta and Scheres, 2014; Herbort et al., 2016). Therefore, it is possible that differences in rewardrelated processing may partially underlie the opposing effects of impulsivity on choice behavior observed in the current study. Second, different relationships in controls and BPD may suggest that other pathological processes (overall psychiatric liability, for example) that are associated with BPD are contributing to the observed effect of impulsivity on choice behavior. In support of this notion, we found similar associations with high levels of emotional dysregulation in BPD (Figures 2D, 4D, see below for discussion), particularly across the goals, impulsivity, and strategies subscales, and DERS scores were highly correlated with BIS scores in BPD, suggesting that these two scales may be tapping into similar constructs underlying BPD pathology. In line with consistent findings in BPD showing exacerbated impulsivity in the face of negative affect and emotional regulation difficulties (Koenigsberg et al., 2001; Chapman et al., 2008; Peters et al., 2013; Sebastian et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2014), our findings may suggest that impulsivity exerts it\u2019s influence on strategic choice behavior in part through the mediating role of emotion dysregulation, although we did not assess this possibility directly."

We found that reward rates were marginally increased as a function of higher levels of emotion dysregulation in the BPD group, particularly, across the goals subscale, which reflects a lack of ability to engage in goal-directed behaviors when emotionally distressed (see section \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d for more detail; Gratz and Roemer, 2004; Herr et al., 2013), and the impulse control subscale, which reflects difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors when emotionally distressed (see section \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d for more detail; Gratz and Roemer, 2004; Herr et al., 2013). The latter is in confirmation of the BIS findings in BPD. Additionally, and potentially contributing to the relationship between DERS and reward rate, we found that choice entropy (in the spatial domain) also increased with higher levels of emotion dysregulation across the goals (Figure 6B) and strategies (Figure 6B) subscales. Although it is challenging to ascertain whether individuals with higher levels of emotional dysregulation deliberately employed the use of strategic tactics to reduce choice biases (increase entropy) or whether this reflects non-strategic randomness (\u201cnoise\u201d), we found that higher levels of emotional dysregulation were associated with increased attention to outcome information (based on our exploratory analyses, Supplementary Figure 1C), which was itself associated with marginally increased reward rates and choice entropy. Although speculative, these results may suggest that increased levels of emotional dysregulation may contribute to strategic choice behavior in part by enhancing vigilance to outcome information."

            "text": "Economic exchange games are gaining significant traction in understanding deficits in interpersonal functioning across a number of psychiatric conditions (Euler et al., 2019). Game theoretical studies in BPD have found that behaviors during social interactions appear to be less modulated by social signals, which in particular contexts, may appear as greater \u201crationality\u201d in choice (Jeung et al., 2016). While the interpersonal deficits associated with BPD create conflict across a number of domains, in some cases, may have a faciliatory effect on behaving in a self-interested manner in social and economic interactions (Jeung et al., 2016). While behavior during cooperative contexts has been characterized in BPD (King-casas et al., 2008; Sharp, 2012), to our knowledge, this is the first study to examine behavior during a competitive context in BPD. We found that increased emotional dysregulation and increased impulsivity in BPD may facilitate decreased choice biases in this competitive context, although future studies are required to further ascertain whether this is a deliberate process/strategy or a reflection of increased psychopathology more generally (Mukherjee and Kable, 2014).\nIn summary, our results provide a novel account of how two main constructs underlying BPD pathology, impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, affect decision-making in a competitive context. Research supports that individuals with higher clinical indices of impulsivity and affective dysregulation, compared to the BPD clinical group average, experience high therapy-burnout (Yeomans et al., 1994), are more likely to utilize high-cost centers (i.e., ER, inpatient hospitalization) to manage symptoms, and are more likely to attempt suicide (Yeomans et al., 1994; Black et al., 2004; Lieb et al., 2004; Speranza et al., 2011). Despite this, these individuals access the same therapy regimen as other BPD patients (DBT and interpersonal therapy). If replicated in a larger sample, it is possible that the differences in mixedstrategy choice behavior observed in individuals with high levels of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation could be leveraged to identify high-risk patients and streamline individuals into targeted treatment regimens."

            "text": "Several limitations in the present study should be noted. First, our BPD sample was comprised of all treatment-seeking female adolescents, which may limit generalizability to broader BPD populations. Given that patients were recruited from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) groups, it is possible that treatment effects may have contributed to some of the observed results. Several aspects of strategic choice behavior were not significantly different across groups, including overall reward rate, which could suggest that BPD participants, particularly the high impulsivity and emotional dysregulation groups, may have been able to overcome deficits through the use of compensatory strategies (Paret et al., 2017), for example, by increasing vigilance to outcome information, or by opting for the use of random strategies. Another possibility is that while the current study\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 15 February 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 667399\ncaptured the dynamic and interactive nature of complex, realworld strategic engagements, given the use of a computerized opponent (that participants were made aware of), our task only partially captured the social components (Rilling et al., 2002; Spiliopoulos, 2008; Vickery et al., 2015; Parr et al., 2020), thus may not be sensitive to the full range of interpersonal dysfunction typically associated with BPD. Future studies should therefore seek to understand whether strategic game-play against a human opponent stimulates different mentalization processes and is more sensitive to maladaptive decision-making tendencies in adolescents with BPD. Another factor limiting generalizability is that our paradigm did not include a reinforcement learning task for comparison that would allow us to discern whether an increase in unpredictable choice patterns during Matching Pennies was related to explicit suppression of reinforcement learning biases (i.e., strategic randomness) or whether it was related to an inability to assess and choose among options varying in value that would likely result in poorer task performance in other contexts (i.e., during the Iowa Gambling Task; Haaland and Landro, 2007; Schuermann et al., 2011). Future studies should seek to clarify whether seemingly improved performance with higher levels of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation in BPD are reflective of intentional (strategic) randomness or unintentional randomness that may be a reflection of psychopathology (Mukherjee and Kable, 2014). Another limitation in the current study is the lack of a secondary assessment of cognition or non-verbal intelligence that would allow us to disentangle changes in strategic choice behavior from general cognitive deficits in other contexts. Finally, given that this exploratory study was cross-sectional with a relatively small sample size and several of the effects observed in the current study were modest, we may have been underpowered to detect meaningful effects and therefore, an important area for future work is to extend this line of inquiry into a large, well-powered, sample using a longitudinal design (potentially in high-risk developmental samples) that explores the relationship between emergent BPD traits in adolescents and functional outcomes through to adulthood."
