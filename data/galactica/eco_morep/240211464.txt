We study the weighted Myerson value for Network games extending a similar concept for communication situations. Network games, unlike communication situations, treat direct and indirect links among players differently and distinguish their effects in both worth generation and allocation process. The weighted Myerson value is an allocation rule for Network games that generalizes the Myerson value of Network games. Here, the players are assumed to have some weights measuring their capacity to form links with other players. Two characterization of the weighted Myerson value are provided. Finally we propose a bidding mechanism to show that the weighted Myerson value is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium under a non-cooperative framework. 1 conclusion takes into consideration the possibility that the game may conclude without any agreements, factoring in a probability element. It is important to note that the fundamental concept of removing players at the end of a round aligns with the idea of deleting all the links associated with a player in this mechanism as well. However, it is essential to highlight that while their findings have some relevance, applying their results directly is not straightforward. This is primarily because removing a player’s links could potentially divide the network into several components as the process continues. Consequently, this situation might result in the existence of several parallel mechanisms in subsequent rounds, which is distinct from the mechanism introduced by Hart and Mas-Colell [25], where such a scenario does not arise. 5.2.1 recursive formula We now introduce a recursive expression for the weighted Myerson value. Theorem 9. Let v ∈ VN and g ∈ GN . Then for all i ∈ N and S ⊆ N , we have,

= Y w−MVi (g|S , v). Next, we proceed with the formal explanation of the mechanism. 5.2.2 the bidding process When the number of players in the network g is 1,i.e., n(g) = 1, the solitary player i within this network receives her standalone value 0. Now, let us consider the scenario where n(g) = m, and the mechanism is defined for networks or components consisting of at most m − 1 players. The mechanism works in a series of rounds, and each round has three steps (denoted as t = 1− 3). After a round is done, the game can either end or start new rounds for any remaining players. Now that we have set the context, we explain how one round works, designed for a network with m players. It is also important to mention that there is a constant parameter, denoted as 0 ≤ ρ < 1, which is predetermined for the mechanism. The mechanism progresses in multiple rounds, and each round has different phases. In each round, a group of active participants, represented as S ⊆ N , is selected. From this group, one individual, denoted as i ∈ S, becomes the proposer. The various steps of the bargaining process within these rounds is as follows:
Stage 1. In the initial round, the active set encompasses all players, i.e., S = N . The proposer is selected in
a random manner from within the set S, with every player in S having an equal likelihood of being chosen. Suppose, i ∈ S is chosen as the proposer. Proceed to Stage 2. Stage 2. The proposer subsequently presents an offer,
∑
j∈N
a g|S ,i
j ≤ v(g|S ). Proceed to Stage 3. Stage 3. During this phase, participants within the set S, excluding the proposer i, individually assess and
sequentially determine their acceptance or rejection of the proposed offers. As a result, two separate scenarios can occur. Case (a). If every member belonging to the set S agrees to the proposed offer, ascertained through
a predetermined sequence of inquiries, the game concludes, and the associated payoffs are determined accordingly. Stop. Case (b). Should the offer face rejection from a single member within the set S, a situation unfolds
where, with a likelihood of ρ, progression proceeds to the subsequent round, encompassing the same active player set S. Conversely, with a probability of 1 − ρ, a breakdown scenario ensues: the proposer i exits the game, obtaining a payoff of zero, and the group of active players transforms into S \ i. Stop. This process constitutes a sequential game with perfect information, wherein each step follows a predetermined order, and all players possess complete knowledge of previous actions. Within this context, a stationary sub-game perfect equilibrium (referred to as SP equilibrium) is established. Notably, the weighted average of proposals within this equilibrium aligns with the weighted Myerson value. Additionally, as the probability denoted by ρ approaches unity, the proposals within these equilibria tend towards the weighted Myerson value, further reinforcing their convergence. In this mechanism, it is important to highlight that the decisions made in a specific phase during a particular round can take into account the payoffs from previous rounds and stages, and this will not affect the overall analysis. To keep things clear in our notation, we will not always explicitly mention the exact specification that we are considering. Instead, we will concentrate on comparing payoffs within a specific setup. Additionally, it is important to consider that in the event of a breakdown, with a probability of 1−ρ, when the player exits the network, it can potentially fragment into multiple distinct components. Consequently, multiple parallel mechanisms may also initiate as a result of this fragmentation. Proposition 2. Let, g ∈ GN and v ∈ HN be zero monotonic. Then for each specification of ρ(0 ≤ ρ < 1), there is a SP equilibrium. The proposals corresponding to a SP equilibrium are always accepted and they are characterized by the following:
a.1 a g|S ,i i (ρ) = v(g|S )− ∑
j 6=i
a g|S ,i
j (ρ) for each i ∈ S ⊆ N . a.2 a g|S ,i j (ρ) = ρa g|S j (ρ) + (1− ρ)a g|S\i j (ρ) for each i, j ∈ S with i 6= j and S ⊆ N where
ag|S (ρ) = 1 ∑
i∈S
wi
∑
i∈S
wia g|S ,i(ρ). Moreover, these proposals are unique and non-negative. We use the recursive formula given in the next proposition and omit the formal proof of this proposi-
tion as it easily follows along the lines of the proof of Proposition 2 in [25]. Proposition 3. Let, (ag|S (ρ))S⊆N be the payoff configuration associated with proposals satisfying (a.1) and (a.2), then it holds that
a g|S i (ρ) = 1 ∑
j∈S wj
 wi[v(g|S )− v(g|S\i)] + ∑
j 6=i
wja g|S\j i (ρ)

 , i ∈ S ⊆ N. (11)
Moreover, these vectors (ag|S (ρ))S⊆N are unique and non-negative. Proof. Let, g ∈ GN and v ∈ HN be zero monotonic. By (a.1), for any i ∈ S ⊆ N , we have,
∑
j∈S
wja g|S i (ρ) = wi
(

j 6=i

Applying (a.2),

Thus, we have

. The payoff of the single coalitions {i} is a g|{i} i (ρ) = v({i}) = 0 (i.e., i ∈ N0(g)) = Y w−MV i ({i}, v) for all i ∈ N. Therefore, the non-negativity and the uniqueness of a g|S i (ρ) follows from the monotonicity of v and Eq. (11) applied recursively. Hence, from Eq. (10), we conclude that a g|S i (ρ) = Y w−MV i (g|S , v) ∀S ⊆ N.
Theorem 10. Let, g ∈ GN and v ∈ HN be zero monotonic. Then for each 0 ≤ ρ < 1, there is a unique SP equilibrium. Moreover, for all i ∈ S ⊆ N , the SP equilibrium payoff vector (ag|S ,i(ρ))S⊆N coincides with the weighted Myerson value for (g|S , v). Also, as ρ → 1, the SP equilibrium proposals (a g|S i (ρ))S⊆N,i∈S converges to the weighted Myerson value for (g|S , v). Proof. The first part of the theorem follows directly from Propositions 2 and 3. Now, for ρ → 1, from (a.1) and (a.2), we have,
a g|S ,i i (ρ) = v(g|S )− ∑
j 6=i
a g|S ,i
j (ρ)
= v(g|S )− ∑
j 6=i
[ρa g|S j (ρ) + (1− ρ)a g|S\i j (ρ)]
= (1 − ρ)v(g|S )− (1 − ρ)v(g|S\i) + ρa g|S i (ρ) = (1 − ρ)[v(g|S )− v(g|S\i)] + ρa g|S i (ρ)
and
a g|S ,j i (ρ) = ρa g|S i (ρ) + (1− ρ)a g|S\j i (ρ). which implies that a g|S ,i i (ρ) → a g|S i (ρ) and a g|S ,j i (ρ) → a g|S i (ρ). 6 conclusion In this paper, we begin by presenting characterizations of the weighted Myerson value within Network games. This formulation closely aligns with the weighted Myerson value previously defined by Haeringer [16] for communication structures. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of w-potential in a network
structure. Another novelty is the bidding mechanism of weighted Myerson values, employing a procedure similar to the one outlined earlier by Slikker [35] and Hart and Mas-Colell [25] in networks and cooperative TU-games respectively. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the weighted Myerson value finds support within each sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of the individualistic game outlined in section 5. By introducing the bidding mechanism, we gain valuable insights into the interactions that takes place among players. This approach provides a framework for comprehending the determinants that underlie the existence of this specific set of allocation rules.
