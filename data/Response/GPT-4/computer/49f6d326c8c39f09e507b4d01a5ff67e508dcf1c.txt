Expansion of Predictive Models Beyond the Middle Region: Future research could focus on developing predictive models for coronal hole dimensions in other regions of the Sun, such as the polar areas and the equatorial zone. These models could help in understanding the full spectrum of solar activities and their impact on space weather, providing a more comprehensive overview of potential geomagnetic disturbances on Earth.

Longitudinal Studies Covering Multiple Solar Cycles: Undertaking long-term studies that span multiple solar cycles could provide invaluable insights into the cyclical nature of coronal holes and their behavior over different solar activity phases. Such studies could enhance the accuracy of predictive models by incorporating data that represent a broader range of solar activities, from minimum to maximum solar cycles.

Integration of Multi-source Data and Observatories: Future research could benefit from integrating data from a wider array of solar observatories and instruments, including ground-based telescopes and other space missions beyond SDO. This approach could lead to a more nuanced understanding of coronal holes by capturing a diverse set of observations and measurements, improving the model's precision and reliability.

Investigation of Coronal Hole Genesis and Evolution: A deeper exploration into the physical processes that govern the formation and development of coronal holes could unveil fundamental insights into solar dynamics. Research in this area could focus on the mechanisms that lead to the emergence of coronal holes, their growth and shrinkage patterns, and the factors influencing their long-term evolution.

Assessment of Coronal Hole Impacts on Technology and Climate: Building on the predictive models of coronal hole dimensions, future studies could explore the direct and indirect impacts of coronal holes on Earth’s technological systems (such as satellites and power grids) and potentially on the Earth's climate. This line of research would be crucial for developing mitigation strategies to protect Earth’s technological infrastructure and understand any broader environmental implications.
