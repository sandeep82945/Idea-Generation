 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the specific roles of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the kidney epithelium and endothelium during CKD progression using conditional knockout mouse models. This could elucidate new mechanisms and substrates involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction. 

2. Examine the effects of ADAM10/17 inhibition specifically in myeloid cells or vascular cells on atherosclerosis development and progression in mouse models of CKD. This could reveal whether targeting these proteases could reduce CVD risk in CKD.

3. Analyze ADAM10 and ADAM17 levels and activity in blood and urine samples from CKD patients to determine if they correlate with disease progression and CVD events. This could identify them as novel biomarkers. 

4. Perform proteomic analysis of the substrates shed by ADAM10/17 in the plasma of CKD patients compared to healthy controls. This could uncover novel soluble mediators contributing to systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction.

5. Investigate the roles of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in extracellular vesicle release and composition in experimental CKD. This could provide insights into their involvement in cell-cell communication mechanisms underlying cardiorenal crosstalk.
