    "abstractText": "In this paper, we report the synthesis of high-quality Ta2Ni3Se8 crystals free of noble or toxic elements and the fabrication and testing of photodetectors on the wire samples. A broadband photoresponse from 405 nm to 1550 nm is observed, along with performance parameters including relatively high photoresponsivity (10 mA W) and specific detectivity (3.5 \u00d7 10 Jones) and comparably short response time (\u03c4rise = 433 ms, \u03c4decay = 372 ms) for 1064 nm, 0.5 V bias and 1.352 mW mm. Through extensive measurement and analysis, it is determined that the dominant mechanism for photocurrent generation is the photo-bolometric effect, which is believed to be responsible for the very broad spectral detection capability. More importantly, the pronounced response to 1310 nm and 1550 nm wavelengths manifests its promising applications in optical communications. Considering the quasi-one-dimensional structure with layered texture, the potential to build nanodevices on Ta2Ni3Se8 makes it even more important in future electronic and optoelectronic applications.",

            "text": "In this paper, we report the synthesis of high-quality Ta2Ni3Se8 crystals free of noble or toxic elements and the fabrication and testing of photodetectors on the wire samples. A broadband photoresponse from 405 nm to 1550 nm is observed, along with performance parameters including relatively high photoresponsivity (10 mA W-1) and specific detectivity (3.5 \u00d7 107 Jones) and comparably short response time (\u03c4rise = 433 ms, \u03c4decay = 372 ms) for 1064 nm, 0.5 V bias and 1.352 mW mm-2. Through extensive measurement and analysis, it is determined that the dominant mechanism for photocurrent generation is the photo-bolometric effect, which is believed to be responsible for the very broad spectral detection capability. More importantly, the pronounced response to 1310 nm and 1550 nm wavelengths manifests its promising applications in optical communications. Considering the quasi-one-dimensional structure with layered texture, the potential to build nanodevices on Ta2Ni3Se8 makes it even more important in future electronic and optoelectronic applications.\nKeywords: narrow bandgap semiconductors, optoelectronic devices, infrared detectors, optical communications"

            "text": "Photodetectors, with the ability to convert incident light into electrical signals, are essential for industrial and scientific applications [1-3]. Generally, photodetectors can be divided into two types, i.e., specific wavelength detectors (ultraviolet (UV) detectors, visible light (vis) detectors or infrared (IR) detectors) and broadband detectors (UV-IR detectors) [4], according to the detection spectral range. Specific wavelength photodetectors need to work under a certain single wavelength or a narrow range of light, showing specific applications in light detection and nanophotonic integrated circuits [5, 6]. In contrast, broadband photodetectors have enormous potential applications in UV\u2212vis\u2212IR light communications, memory storage and broad-spectrum switching in a single optoelectronic system [1, 7, 8]. In the past few years, many commercial photodetectors are typically based on crystalline GaN [9], Si [10] and InGaAs [11] and used for 250\u2212400 nm (UV), 400\u2212800 nm (vis) and 900\u22121700 nm (near-IR) detection, respectively. In addition, longwave IR detectors based on narrow bandgap or semimetal materials have been extensively studied, such as HgCdTe [12], InSb [13, 14] and Cd3As2 [15]. Although these materials show good performance in the near-IR and longwave IR, photodetectors based on these materials contain toxic elements and often require low temperatures to achieve high performance, which makes the systems bulky, expensive, and harmful to humans and the environment [16]. Therefore, there is a great need to develop high-performance IR photodetectors that operate at room temperature and consist only of low-cost and nontoxic elements.\nRecently, the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) chain compounds M2X3Y8 (M= Ta,\nNb; X= Ni, Pd, Pt; Y=S, Se) have drawn considerable attention for their intriguing electronic properties related to the quasi-1D structure [17-20]. For the crystal structure, the atoms in the chains are connected by strong chemical bonds, while the inter-chain bonds are relatively weak, i.e., the van-der-Waals (vdW) interactions. Crystals of this type usually show a needle-like or fine hair morphology. For the electronic structure, the Ta2Pd3Se8 and\nTa2Pt3Se8 transistors are n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively [18]. Meanwhile, these materials also exhibit outstanding optoelectronic properties [21, 22]. Among these compounds, Ta2Ni3Se8 is a low-cost material free of noble or toxic elements, unlike its analogues with noble metals such as Pd and Pt. Ta2Ni3Se8 nanowire transistor has been identified as an ambipolar semiconductor [20]. Considering the interesting electronic structure and properties, Ta2Ni3Se8 holds promise for possible applications in the field of photodetection, but it remains to be explored.\nIn this work, we report the synthesis of high-quality Ta2Ni3Se8 crystals and the\nfabrication and testing of photodetectors on the wire samples. A broadband photoresponse from 405 nm to 1550 nm is observed, along with performance parameters including relatively high photoresponsivity (10 mA W-1) and specific detectivity (3.5 \u00d7 107 Jones) and comparably short response time (\u03c4rise = 433 ms, \u03c4decay = 372 ms) for 1064 nm, 0.5 V bias and 1.352 mW mm-2. Through extensive measurement and analysis, it is determined that the dominant mechanism for photocurrent generation is the photo-bolometric (PB) effect, which is believed to be responsible for the very broad spectral detection capability. More importantly, the pronounced response to 1310 nm and 1550 nm wavelengths manifests its promising applications in optical communications. The quasi-1D structure with layered texture and the potential to build nanodevices make it even more important.\n2. Methods Ta2Ni3Se8 crystals were prepared by a one-step method [20]. High purity powders of Ta (99.98%, Alfa Aesar), Ni (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and Se (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) were mixed and ground in a chemical molar ratio of 2:3:10. The mixture was then sealed in a 12 cm long evacuated quartz ampule, heated to 700 \u00b0C at a rate of 2 \u00b0C/min, and kept at this temperature for 7 days before cooling down to room temperature. After the reaction, large needle-like or fine hair-like Ta2Ni3Se8 crystals can be obtained on the surface of the solid solution. See the supplementary information for the optical image. The crystal structure and phase purity were checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on a Rigaku-TTR3 X-\nray diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation at room temperature. Chemical composition characterization was performed on an Oxford Inca energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) equipped with a FEI Helios Nanolab 600i scanning electron microscope (SEM). Raman spectrum was collected in a backscattering geometry on a Horiba JobinYvon T6400 spectrometer with a 532 nm laser.\nPhotodetectors were fabricated based on Ta2Ni3Se8 wires. Gold wires were directly connected to the sample using silver paste for good ohmic contact. According to the previous reference [20], the use of chromium as the contact electrodes resulted in a relatively low Schottky barrier of 50 meV, which was a nearly ohmic contact. Considering the low work function of chromium (4.5 eV) and the ambipolar semiconductor characteristic of Ta2Ni3Se8, we adopted another low work function metal, i.e., silver (4.3 eV). The channel area of the device on SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrate was about 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 2 mm, and the thickness of the active material was about 2 \u03bcm. The optoelectronic measurements were carried out on a home-built multi measurement system consisting of a microscope, a four-probe station, a semiconductor parameter analyzer (2636B, Keithley) and laser light sources with different wavelengths. The incident light power density was measured using a power meter (PM100D, Thorlabs). The incident laser spot diameter was approximately 5 mm, which is larger than the channel area to ensure uniform illumination. The electronic structure of bulk Ta2Ni3Se8 was theoretically investigated by first-principles calculations using the WIEN2K code [23]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of PerdewBurke-Ernzerhof [24] was employed with a k-mesh of 1000 points. The lattice constants used for the calculations were taken from the Springer Materials website.\n3. Results and discussion The crystal structure of Ta2Ni3Se8 is orthorhombic with the space group Pbam. It is found that the unit cell of Ta2Ni3Se8 contains four interconnected chains forming a zigzag structure extending along the c-axis. Each chain consists of two edge-sharing chains of trigonal prisms centered on Ta atoms and bridged by Ni atoms, as shown in figure 1(a).\nBetween linear chains are vdW gaps, which facilitate the quasi-1D structure. Figures 1(b) and (c) show the band structure and density of states (DOS) of Ta2Ni3Se8 along the high symmetry directions, respectively. The calculated bandgap is about 0.25 eV, indicating that it is a narrow bandgap semiconductor. The obtained value is close to the reported results [20], confirming the reliability of our calculations. From the band structure, the bandgap is an indirect one since the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) do not coincide at the same point. The VBM and CBM appear to be in the UX and YZ segments, respectively. From the DOS plots, the CBM and VBM are mainly composed of distorted d and p orbitals of Ta, Ni and Se ions, revealing the nature of covalent bonding.\nThe obtained crystals were characterized by XRD, EDS and Raman spectroscopy. Figure 2(a) shows the XRD pattern of a bunch of thin wires. All diffraction peaks can be indexed, which is in good agreement with the powder XRD results (JCPDS PDF No. 00- 086-0186), indicating that the compound is single-phase Ta2Ni3Se8. Figure 2(b) shows a typical SEM image of a Ta2Ni3Se8 wire. The surface of the wire is flat and smooth. Interestingly, the side view reveals a feature of layered texture, suggesting the possibility of exfoliation. The EDS spectrum collected on the wire surface indicates a chemical composition of Ta:Ni:Se = 16.44%:23.62%:59.94% (figure 2(c)), which is very close to the stoichiometric ratio of 2:3:8. Note that due to the low melting point (221\u00b0C) and high saturation vapor pressure of Se, there is a certain degree of Se vacancies. Furthermore, figure 2(d) shows the EDS mapping results of the total scan and elemental scan of Ta, Ni and Se atoms, respectively. The uniform distribution of the elements confirms the high quality of the crystals. More EDS data are presented in the supplementary information. In addition, the Raman spectrum shown in the supplementary information is consistent with a recent report [25]. No photoluminescence signal was observed due to the indirect bandgap feature.\nTo investigate the optoelectronic properties of Ta2Ni3Se8, several two-terminal devices with similar dimensions were fabricated based on Ta2Ni3Se8 wires and tested. Since there\nare no significant differences between these devices, we only provide experimental results for a representative device here (see the supplementary information for other devices). In figure 3, we summarize the optoelectronic measurements of device D1 in the dark and under laser illumination of different wavelengths (\u03bb), i.e., 405 nm, 450 nm, 488 nm, 635 nm, 780 nm, 830 nm, 940 nm and 1064 nm. The laser power density is tuned to a constant value of 1.352 mW mm-2. As shown in figure 3(a), the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curves pass through the origin and are almost completely linear with \u00b10.5 V, indicating a good ohmic contact between Ta2Ni3Se8 and the electrodes, which also rules out the possibility of Schottky contact. The inset shows an enlarged view of the I-V curves in the range of 0.48 V to 0.5 V. The dark current at 0.5 V corresponds to a current density of 256 A cm-2. A clear difference between the dark and illuminated states is observed at all laser wavelengths, implying that the photodetector responds to a broad spectral range from UVA to the entire visible spectrum to the near-IR. Figure 3(b) shows the calculated photocurrents for various wavelengths under 0.5 V bias. The photocurrent is defined as Iph = Iillumination - Idark, where Iillumination and Idark are the currents measured in the illuminated and dark states, respectively. From figure 3(b), the photocurrent at \u03bb = 405 nm is remarkable, reaching 120 nA. Although it degrades for longer wavelengths, the photocurrent in the IR region is significant enough. Given that the calculated bandgap of Ta2Ni3Se8 is 0.25 V, which corresponds to a wavelength of 4959 nm, the wavelengths used in the present work far exceed the bandgap. Shorter wavelength photons have higher energy and will excite more electrons deep in the valence band [26]. This could explain the phenomenon that larger photocurrents appear at shorter wavelength. This is a preliminary judgement. In-depth studies on the mechanism will be presented in the next section.\nTo further evaluate the optoelectronic performance, some key parameters are\ncalculated, including responsivity (R = Iph\nPS , where P is the laser power density and S is the\nilluminated area) representing the conversion efficiency from incident light signal to electrical signal, specific detectivity (D* = R\u221a S\n2eIdark , where e is the elementary charge)\ncharacterizing the capability to detect the lowest light signal, and external quantum efficiency (EQE = hc\ne\u03bb R \u00d7 100%, where c is the speed of light in vacuum) referring to the\nnumber of electrons excited by each incident photon [27, 28]. Figures 3(c) and (d) show R (left axis), D* (right) and EQE as a function of wavelength, respectively. The most significant parameters are recorded as R = 43.3 mA W-1, D* = 1.5 \u00d7 108 Jones and EQE = 13.3%, appearing at \ud835\udf06 = 405 nm and P = 1.352 mW mm-2. Meanwhile, when the photodetector is exposed to the 1064 nm near-IR light with the same power density, relatively high responsivity (R = 10 mA W-1) and specific detectivity (D* = 3.5\u00d7107 Jones) can be obtained. These parameters are significant, even in comparison with other outstanding photodetectors fabricated on ternary compounds [29-34] or quasi-1D wires [29, 30, 35, 36]. Considering the broadband photoresponse, the advantage of Ta2Ni3Se8 photodetector is more prominent.\nThe dependence of optoelectronic properties on laser power density is further studied.\nConsidering the harmless feature of visible light, the 635 nm laser is selected to perform more measurements. As shown in figure 4(a), the I-V curves exhibit a clear dependence on power density. The photocurrent is calculated and plotted as a function of bias voltage for different power densities ranging from 0.16 to 1.352 mW mm-2 (figure 4(b)). Two characteristics can be observed. First, the photocurrent increases as the power density increases. Second, all the curves are near linear, which is easy to understand because of the linear dependence of the curves in figure 4(a). The inset of figure 4(b) shows the timeresolved photocurrent taken under different power densities and 0.01 V bias. The ladderlike curve shows well-defined ON and OFF states, indicating good stability and nonvolatile feature of the device. The photocurrent is about 9 nA at 1.352 mW mm-2 and decreases to 1 nA at 0.16 mW mm-2. Upon further decreasing the power density, no obvious photocurrent is detected. Additional experiments performed to test the long-term stability can be found in the supplementary information.\nThe relationship between photocurrent and power density is important for studying the\nunderlying mechanism [7, 30, 31]. Generally, the photocurrent is a power function of the power density, i.e., Iph  P \u03b1, where \u03b1 is the power exponent. It is suggested that \u03b1 = 1 corresponds to the ideal photoconductive (PC) effect and \u03b1 < 1 indicates existence of photogating effect arising from trapping states [31]. Figure 4(c) shows the photocurrent plotted as a function of power density at 0.1 V, 0.3 V and 0.5 V biases. The data points are fitted to the power law, which give \u03b1 values of 1.14, 1.16 and 1.14, respectively. These values appear to be independent of bias, which is consistent with the linear photocurrentbias relationship mentioned above (figure 4(b)). The consistent values also confirm the reliability of the fits. Unexpectedly, \u03b1 here is larger than 1, which suggests another mechanism than the photoconductive or photogating effect. Usually, \u03b1 over 1 is related to photo-bolometric effect [37, 38]. Since the laser spot covers the entire channel area, the channel of the photodetector is heated evenly. That is, thermal gradients are negligible and thermoelectric mechanism can be ruled out. The generation of photocurrent is simply attributed to the decrease in channel resistance caused by heating due to photon absorption (see figure 5(a) for a schematic illustration of this effect). In addition to the power-law fits, more evidence can support the determination of the photo-bolometric effect. First, this effect requires, in principle, that the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the bias voltage. This is consistent with our measurements (figure 4(b)). Second, the photo-bolometric effect leads to a gradual increase in the responsivity and detectivity [37]. This can also be seen in our case, as shown in figure 4(d). The responsivity here can be formulated as \ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udc3cph \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc46  \ud835\udc43\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc430.14. It is thus reasonable that the responsivity increases with increasing power density and gradually approaches saturation. Third, this effect does not involve the bandgap width [7]. Therefore, a broadband photoresponse is expected. This is exactly the most important feature of Ta2Ni3Se8 photodetectors. All these facts are self-consistent and demonstrate the dominant role of the photo-bolometric effect.\nFurthermore, the response time of the Ta2Ni3Se8 photodetector is studied in detail.\nFigures 5(b)-(i) show the time-resolved photocurrent taken at 0.01 V bias and P = 1.352\nmW mm-2 under periodic illumination of different wavelengths (405-1064 nm). All curves exhibit good switching cycle stability, indicating that the photodetector can operate well and persistently at various wavelengths. As a commonly used method, the rising time (\u03c4rise) is defined as the time for the photocurrent to increase from 10% to 90% of the maximum value, and the recovery time (\u03c4decay) is the time for the photocurrent to decrease from 90% to 10%. As shown in the insets of figures 5(b)-(i), the determination process gives relatively short response time (\u03c4rise < 600 ms and \u03c4decay < 820 ms) in the detection spectral range, which is comparable to the performance of some benchmark photodetectors reported previously, such as monolayer MoS2 [39], Ta2Se8I [37], SnSe [40] and graphene oxide [41]. The fastest response occurs under 830 nm illumination, i.e., \u03c4rise = 360 ms and \u03c4decay = 400 ms. In addition, the good square waveforms indicate that the devices are not RC constant limited for the given parameters. See the supplementary information for the relationship between the RC constant and the photocurrent-time waveform and the power density dependence of the response time.\nGiven the prominent performance and the broadband photoresponse, it is natural to extend the testing further into longer wavelength region, such as the telecommunication band, which is important for today\u2019s industrial and consumer electronics [3, 42]. Here we select two typical wavelengths in the telecommunication band, namely O band 1310 nm and C band 1550 nm for testing. Figure 6(a) presents a schematic illustration of the Ta2Ni3Se8 photodetector under global telecommunication wavelength illumination. As shown in figure 6(b), linear I-V curves together with clear photoresponse are again observed. Figures 6(c) and (d) show the time-resolved photocurrent at 0.01 V bias under periodic radiation of 1310 nm and 1550 nm, respectively. The device again exhibits good stability and durability. In the meanwhile, the response is also fast, represented by short response time, namely \u03c4rise = 430 ms and \u03c4decay = 414 ms for 1310 nm and \u03c4rise = 354 ms and \u03c4decay = 345 ms for 1550 nm. These values are shorter than the response time of other IR materials, including Ta2NiSe5 [43], VO2 [44] and Ta2Se8I [37]. This result is of great\nsignificance because the pronounced response to 1310 nm and 1550 nm suggests promising applications in optical communications and fiber optic cable testing in O band and C band. To further highlight the performance of Ta2Ni3Se8 as a broadband photodetector, a detailed comparison with other reported materials is listed in Table 1. Considering the quasi-1D layered feature in its structure, the potential to build nanodevices on Ta2Ni3Se8 makes it even more important in future electronic and optoelectronic applications.\n4. Conclusion In conclusion, we have synthesized high-quality Ta2Ni3Se8 crystals and fabricated photodetectors on the wire samples. The photodetector exhibits relatively high photoresponsivity (10 mA W-1) and specific detectivity (D* = 3.5 \u00d7 107 Jones) and comparably short response time (\u03c4rise = 433 ms, \u03c4decay = 372 ms) for \u03bb = 1064 nm, 0.5 V bias and P = 1.352 mW mm-2. Through extensive measurement and analysis, it is determined that the dominant mechanism for photocurrent generation is the photo-bolometric effect. This effect is believed to be responsible for the very broad spectral detection capability, extending into the mid- to long-IR region. More importantly, the pronounced response to 1310 nm and 1550 nm wavelengths manifests its promising applications in optical communications. Future work can focus on the quantum confinement effects at the nanoscale, such as optimizing the optoelectronic properties by manufacturing nanodevices and applying gating techniques."

Combining the two tests, it is affirmed that the device has very good long-term stability and durability.\nFigure S5. (a) 30 response cycles setting the power density to 1.352 mW mm-2.

The response time of the device is limited by the RC constant, which usually occurs when the device is illuminated by high-frequency incident light, and the response time cannot keep up with the frequency of the light, resulting in distorted output waveform, as shown in figure S6(c). In this case, a large parasitic capacitance exists between the channel material and the contact electrodes [B. E. A. Saleh and M. C. Teich, Fundamentals of Photonics. (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore, 1991).]. As seen in figures 3(a) and 4(a), the I-V curves of our devices show very good linearity, indicating that an ohmic contact is formed and the capacitance\nis very small. Furthermore, in our experiments, the laser illumination is repeatedly turned on and off at a low frequency of 0.05 Hz (duty ratio: 50%). Figures 5(b)-5(i) show good switching cycle stability for all curves, indicating that the photodetector can work well and durably at various wavelengths. The slowest response appears at 488 nm, i.e., \u03c4rise = 560 ms and \u03c4decay = 820 ms, both of which are much shorter than the period of the incident light (20 s). The output waveforms are undistorted, similar to that in figure S6(b). These good square waveforms correspond to small parasitic capacitances, which is consistent with the linear I-V curves. That is, our devices are not RC constant limited for the given parameters.\nFigure S6.

As shown in figure S7, the response time is \u03c4rise = 342 ms and \u03c4decay = 418 ms for P = 1.352 mW mm -2, \u03c4rise = 320 ms and \u03c4decay = 360 ms for P = 0.75 mW mm -2, and \u03c4rise = 216 ms and \u03c4decay = 327 ms for P = 1.352 mW mm-2, respectively. It seems that the response becomes slower at higher power densities. Here is a possible explanation. Given that the response time is not limited by the RC constant, another factor limiting the response time is the carrier transit time \u03c4tr, which is defined as the time the carriers take to go through the channel. It can be expressed as \u03c4tr=L 2/2\u00b5Vbias , where L is the channel length and \u03bc is the carrier mobility. As \u03bc decreases, \u03c4tr and response time increase. For photodetectors conforming to the photobolometric effect, the heating process caused by photon absorption affects the carrier\nmobility. For higher power densities, more light absorption means increased temperature and enhanced phonon scattering, which will suppress the carrier mobility. Therefore, higher power density corresponds to slower response.\nFigure S7. Response time measured under different power densities."
