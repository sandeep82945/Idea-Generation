    "abstractText": "Many organizations, including governments, utilities, and businesses, have set ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions as a part of their sustainability goals. To achieve these targets, these organizations increasingly use power purchase agreements (PPAs) to obtain renewable energy credits, which they use to offset their \u201cbrown\u201d energy consumption. However, the details of these PPAs are often private and not shared with important stakeholders, such as grid operators and carbon information services, whomonitor and report the grid\u2019s carbon emissions. This often results in incorrect carbon accounting where the same renewable energy production could be factored into grid carbon emission reports and also separately claimed by organizations that own PPAs. Such \u201cdouble counting\u201d of renewable energy production could lead to organizations with PPAs to understate their carbon emissions and overstate their progress towards their sustainability goals. Further, we show that commonly-used carbon reduction measures, such as load shifting, can have the opposite effect of increasing emissions if such measures were to use inaccurate carbon intensity signals. For instance, users may increase energy consumption because the grid\u2019s carbon intensity appears low even though carbon intensity may actually be high when renewable energy attributed to PPAs are excluded. Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus on how to accurately compute the grid\u2019s carbon intensity by properly accounting for PPAs. The goal of our work is to shed quantitative light on the renewable energy attribution problem and evaluate its impact of inaccurate accounting on carbon-aware systems.",

            "text": "Many organizations, including governments, utilities, and businesses, have set ambitious targets for achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner [2, 7, 24, 37, 39\u201341]. These organizations often rely heavily on the electric grid. The effort to decarbonize the grid has resulted in significant increases in renewable energy, such as hydro, geothermal, solar, and wind energy. However, the energy from the electric grid is unlikely to be completely carbon-free in the near future [5]. Consequently, organizations have begun to address their decarbonization goals by \u201coffsetting\u201d carbon-intensive grid energy with zero-carbon renewable energy generated at other physical locations and times.\nMany types of carbon offsets exist today [10]. An example is an annualized offset that involves purchasing zero-carbon energy over a year to match an organization\u2019s annual energy consumption. Another common offset type is the purchase of renewable energy certificates from a renewable energy producer to offset the consumption of brown energy. Studies have pointed out that neither offset achieves true decarbonization since both involve local consumption of non-carbon-free energy [11, 48].\nThe strictest offsetting approach used today, known as 24/7 carbon-free energy matching, performs location-specific matching on an hourly basis [17]. This offsetting is primarily done through power purchase agreements (PPAs). The renewable energy producer (the seller) and the purchasing organization (the buyer) sign an agreement where the buyer purchases energy at a \u201cstrike\u201d price and corresponding renewable energy credits. The seller sells the energy in the wholesale market and settles the difference from the strike prices with the buyer. The buying organization separately buys the energy from the electric grid. It is worth noting that PPA agreements are private transactions and, thus, are not visible to the electric grid and other stakeholders. Studies have argued that 24/7 matching encourages the creation of additional renewable capacity in the grid by providing guarantees on the return on investment to developers who install and run these generation facilities [34].\nFrom a consumer\u2019s standpoint, whether the consumer is a residential home or a large organization, there is an important attribution problem of accurately apportioning the finite amount of carbon-free energy in the electric grid across various consumers, which determines their carbon footprint. As per the greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol, there are two primary ways of attributing carbonfree energy: location-based and market-based [46]. Location-based attribution assumes that all consumers consume an electricity mix based on all fossil-based and fossil-free generation sources present at that location. That is, location-based attribution assumes that electrons from various generation sources in the electric grid cannot be distinguished from one another. Hence, carbon-free energy is attributed to the electric grid, and all the consumers use carbonfree energy in proportion to the grid\u2019s carbon-free and fossil-based generation. Market-based attribution assumes a consumer or organization can choose the generation source that supplies their electricity, even though it is technically impossible to route specific electricity generation to specific end-consumers, even if both are on the same grid. Hence, the attribution is done via market-based accounting mechanisms, where an organization can claim renewable energy exclusively for their needs by purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs) or through PPA-based agreements.\nThe incentives introduced by both approaches are diametrically opposed, which leads to different stakeholders in the electric grid using different approaches for attribution. For example, a company investing in PPAs would prefer market-based attribution to count\nar X\niv :2\n30 8.\n06 68\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.D C\n] 1\n3 A\nug 2\n02 3\nall the renewable energy generated from that source towards its consumption. Conversely, location-based attribution better suits smaller organizations or household consumers who do not have enough demand or financial power to purchase PPAs. The lack of consensus on attribution approaches and the hidden nature of PPAs can lead to double counting carbon-free energy use [21] and incorrect calculation of an organization\u2019s carbon footprint. Specifically, unless done carefully, renewable energy\u2019s contribution may be counted once by an organization that has signed a PPA agreement and again as a part of the grid\u2019s energy mix lowering the grid\u2019s average carbon emissions. Such double counting and mixing of location- and market-based attribution would likely lead companies to underestimate and understate their carbon emissions.\nThese discrepancies can have two key implications. First, it gives an incorrect impression of the decarbonization of the electric grid. The same carbon-free energy is attributed differently through market- and location-based attribution mechanisms, allowing multiple end users to \u201cclaim\u201d each unit of carbon-free energy. Second, it complicates the design of information services that estimate the carbon intensity of electricity supply and exposes it in real-time to end users. Computing researchers have been developing carbon-aware resource management techniques to \u201cgreen\u201d large-scale systems, such as hyperscaler cloud platforms, enterprise data centers, and large GPU clusters for AI model training. This body of research depends on visibility into the grid\u2019s carbon intensity variations [4], which have been used to develop scheduling methods, such as spatial and temporal load shifting. The complexity of carbon attribution mechanisms can result in problems with accurate carbon estimation of electricity, which can lead such research and the resulting techniques deployed in production systems to make incorrect carbon optimization decisions. In particular, consumers may increase energy consumption because the grid\u2019s carbon intensity appears low even though carbon intensity may be high when excluding renewable energy attributed to specific companies via PPAs. Thus, accurate attribution and estimation are important for driving carbon-aware computing research and enabling organizations to achieve their decarbonization goals. Our Contributions. In this paper, we highlight these challenges using a data-driven approach. Our paper makes the following contributions in untangling the effects of attribution and estimation on carbon-aware computing methods.\n(1) We first discuss various carbon attribution methods from the perspective of consumers, such as residential users and commercial organizations, and discuss how different attribution methods may be suitable for different end users. (2) We then discuss how these attribution methods directly impact carbon estimation techniques and how lack of visibility into market-driven methods can result in potential doublecounting of renewable energy consumption. Our analysis using ElectricityMaps\u2019 [13] data for 123 regions demonstrates that up to 66.07% renewable energy can be double-counted, leading to up to 194% error in carbon intensity estimations. (3) Finally, we conducted a preliminary study analyzing the impact of inaccurate carbon intensity estimates on the carbon savings achieved by carbon-aware demand response, such as load shifting in data centers. We focus our study on California\nand New England and show that such carbon optimization methods will yield fewer carbon savings than reported, with the discrepancy between actual and reported carbon emission reduction up to 156% in California."

Electricity is generated using a mix of conventional non-renewable sources like coal, petroleum, and gas and renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydro. Once generated, the grid transmits electricity over an interconnected network of high-voltage transmission lines. Finally, the electricity is distributed from stations and substations to the end consumers via low-voltage transmission lines.\nElectricity demand is time-varying, and the grid must ensure that the supply always matches the demand. Renewable sources like solar and wind are volatile; their generation depends on weather conditions and cannot be controlled. As a result, the grid maintains a set of generators that can be turned on or off quickly to meet the demand. If the electricity generation in the grid at any time is insufficient to meet the current demand, the grid imports electricity from the grid of neighboring regions with surplus electricity. Thus, the fraction of electricity generated in a region, called the source mix, varies spatially and temporally and often depends upon the neighboring grids\u2019 source mix."

            "text": "Carbon emitted due to electricity generation is measured in terms of carbon intensity. The average carbon intensity (CI) of electricity is the amount of carbon emitted (in grams) per unit of electrical energy produced or consumed (in kWh). In this paper, we use the terms electricity (or energy) production and electricity (or energy) generation interchangeably. Calculating the carbon intensity of\nproduction, without considering imports, is straightforward and can be mathematically formulated as a weighted average (refer [30]):\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc54) = \u2211 (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 \u2217\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56 )\u2211\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 is the electrical energy produced (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4a\u210e) by a source \ud835\udc56 & \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56 is the carbon emission factor (\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\u210e) of that source.\nThe carbon intensity of the consumed electricity in a region is a weighted average of the carbon intensity of the electricity produced in that region and the carbon intensity of the electricity imported from other regions. Calculating the consumption-based carbon intensity is complex since an exporting region may itself import from other regions, and hencewe need to trace the flow of electricity back to the original source to get the correct carbon intensity of the imported electricity (refer [1, 6, 12, 18, 22, 25, 28, 42, 43]).\nSince the source mix is variable, the carbon intensity of electricity also varies across regions and with time. Figure 1 shows how the average carbon intensity in California (CAISO) differs from Texas (ERCOT), and how it varies within a day in both regions. Non-renewable sources have higher CEFs than renewable sources. Hence, CAISO has a lower average carbon intensity than ERCOT since CAISO has a higher renewable fraction in the grid. Also, within CAISO itself, the carbon intensity is lower during the day when there is solar generation than the night when natural gas compensates for the lack of solar and meets the demand."

            "text": "Scope 2 emissions are defined as the indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that result from the purchase of electricity [46]. Scope 2 carbon accounting is a way for an organization to calculate their operations\u2019 scope 2 carbon emissions. To mitigate the effect of GHG emissions from electricity, companies are increasingly setting targets to become carbon-neutral [44] or even net-zero [45]. The term \u201cnet-zero emissions\u201d refers to achieving an overall balance between GHG emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere. Few companies are shifting their demand to low-carbon regions or periods to reduce their emissions, but most companies are setting \u201cscience-based targets (SBTs)\u201d [8, 49] to align with the global climate goals. Companies are investing in renewable energy via Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). SBTs allow these companies to claim credit for their renewable energy investments and lower the emissions caused by the electricity they consume.\nAccording to the scope 2 GHG guidance protocol [46], depending on how the green energy and the source mix of the consumed electricity are attributed, there are two methods of estimating carbon intensity and accounting for scope 2 emissions: (1) Location-based method. In the location-based method, all\nthe consumers inside a defined geographical location get the same electricity mix in proportion to their consumption. Green energy is attributed to the grid, and the average carbon intensity of the grid mix, including both renewable and non-renewable sources, is used for scope 2 accounting. This is done regardless of any green energy investments made by any specific consumer. Thus, all the consumers in that location share any renewable investment made by a particular company. (2) Market-based method. In the market-based method, a consumer who has invested in renewables can claim the credit for\nthe purchased electricity and reduce their carbon emissions even if their invested green energy is not physically delivered via transmission lines. All invested green energy is first attributed to the investing parties, and then the carbon intensity of the residual grid mix without the invested renewables is estimated. Investing companies meet their remaining demand using the residual mix. On the other hand, consumers without any renewable investments account for their carbon emissions only using the carbon intensity of the residual mix. Thus, a consumer investing in electricity that matches the amount of their energy consumption can claim to be 100% renewable even if the electricity they physically use comes from a grid mix with renewable and non-renewable sources. The Scope 2 GHG guide states that all companies should report their emissions using both location-based and market-based methods (\u201cdual reporting\u201d), but they can use either of the methods to meet their carbon emission reduction goals [9, 46]."

            "text": "Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are contracts between an electricity producer (seller) and an electricity consumer (buyer) [16]. PPAs are usually long-term contracts for renewable energy (primarily solar and wind) wherein the buyer can claim renewable energy credits for their investment; that is, they get a certificate and can use that to claim that they have met a fraction of their consumption using the purchased electricity that was generated using carbon-free energy sources. This certificate is called a Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) in the U.S. and Guarantees of Origin (GO) in Europe [33]. PPAs can be of the following two types: (1) Physical PPA: In a physical PPA, the renewable energy project\nis either on-site, directly supplying the electricity to the buyer, or off-site, where the renewable energy is fed into the same grid where the buyer resides [16]. Note that in off-site PPAs, the seller feeds the renewable energy to the grid while the buyer consumes the electricity from the grid. While the seller may agree to \u201cdeliver\u201d the energy to a specific delivery point in the grid, there is no one-to-one transmission line or another physical method of separating the contracted renewable energy from the rest of the energy consumed by the buyer.\n(2) Financial PPA: Financial PPAs are financial agreements where the seller can be on the same or a different grid, and electricity is not considered delivered to the buyer. Figure 2 shows the structure of a financial (or virtual) PPA. In a financial PPA, an organization signs a PPA with renewable energy producers to purchase green energy for an agreed price. The producer sells the renewable energy in the wholesale electricity market and settles the difference from the agreed price with the buyer [14, 15]. As a part of this financial transaction, the buyer receives the associated credits and claims renewable energy for its needs. There are other types of PPAs as well, but they typically are a slight variation on either of the two main types of PPAs. One such example is \u201csleeved PPA\u201d, which leverages an intermediary utility company to transmit power to a specific delivery point from a renewable energy producer and transfer money from the buyer to the renewable energy producer."

The buyer and seller must also be connected to the same grid. For a company to claim they are 100% carbon-free, its renewable energy investments must align with its demand every hour of the year. Currently, the most prevailing carbon offset approach involves market-based matching of renewable energy production with consumption on an annual basis. However, this approach has a drawback: even if renewable energy is not generated in a particular region at a certain time, the buyer can still claim to be using renewable energy as long as the production and consumption average out over the year. The 24/7 matching approach eliminates this issue and enhances accountability in the market-based accounting method. However, it must be noted that 24/7 matching is not the panacea, as even a company that uses 100% CFE still relies on the grid infrastructure that needs to use fossilfuel-based energy sources that contribute to carbon emissions."

While the specifics of renewable energy investments and carbon credits may vary significantly, our analysis captures the essence of the attribution problem for carbon-free energy and demonstrates the potential for discrepancies in accounting for renewable energy.

            "heading": "3.1 Residential Settings",
            "text": "First, we examine a few scenarios for carbon-free energy attribution in residential settings. We have a toy regional grid powered by carbon-free wind energy and carbon-intensive coal power plants. The carbon intensity of the coal power plant is 1000 g/kWh. These sources provide electricity to the consumers with a total grid-level energy demand of 1000 MWh. Both sources contribute equally to the electricity supply. Within this region, we focus on two example homes, labeled \ud835\udc3b1 and \ud835\udc3b2. Each of these homes consumes 20 kWh of electric energy over a given time period, such as an hour. We next describe different attribution scenarios, as depicted in Figure 3, a residential version of the commercial example in [8].\n3.1.1 Case 1: The first case represents the state of affairs for most electric grid homes that are passive electricity consumers. Both homes consume electricity directly from the grid, and neither has bought any RECs or has a PPA agreement, as shown in Figure 3a. In this case, location- and market-based methods attribute wind and coal proportionally to both homes. Since wind produces 50% of the electricity in the region, the consumption mix of both homes has 50% wind. In this case, there is no cause for the discrepancy or scope of double counting, as the carbon-free energy can only be attributed in one way, regardless of the attribution method.\n3.1.2 Case 2: In the next case, the home \ud835\udc3b2 installs an in front of the meter 10 kWh solar array, which feeds the electricity it generates into the grid. The grid\u2019s energy mix now consists of wind, coal, and solar power plants. While the new solar array can meet half of \ud835\udc3b2\u2019s demand, its contributions toward greening the grid are small as its clean energy production is negligible compared to the overall\ngrid production. In this case, the amount of carbon-free energy attributed to each home varies based on the attribution method used. Under the market-based method (refer to Figure 3b), \ud835\udc3b2 can claim 10 kWh of solar energy towards its energy demand, even if the solar array is not physically delivering any electricity to \ud835\udc3b2. The remaining demand is then met equally by wind and coal from the grid. Thus, \ud835\udc3b2 claims 15 kWh of carbon-free energy \u2014 10 kWh from on-site solar and 5 kWh from wind energy in the electric grid. On the other hand, even if the grid mix that \ud835\udc3b1 consumes contains a fraction of the solar energy, it cannot be attributed to \ud835\udc3b1. Thus, \ud835\udc3b1 still receives the same amount of wind and coal as in Case 1.\nHowever, if the location-based approach is followed (refer to Figure 3b), all of the carbon-free energy is attributed to the grid. Hence, the grid now produces a combined 500.01MWh of carbonfree energy, including wind and solar, shared by both homes. Since solar production is negligible with respect to grid production, each home now consumes 10 + \ud835\udf00 kWh of carbon-free energy and 10 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 kWh of coal (\ud835\udf00 << 1). As expected, the market-based attribution benefits the home with the installed solar, whereas the locationbased investment benefits both the homes, although insignificantly in this case. However, if \ud835\udc3b1 follows the location-based method but \ud835\udc3b2 follows the market-based method, there will be a discrepancy in counting as the 10 kWh of energy from solar would be counted towards \ud835\udc3b2, as well as \ud835\udc3b1 through grid\u2019s energy mix.\n3.1.3 Case 3: The third case represents the current scenario of the electric grid in developed countries where residential homes with solar installations can sell their RECs to interested organizations through a broker. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that\ud835\udc3b1 buys RECs from \ud835\udc3b2 (refer to Figure 3c). The location-based attribution method does not change and considers the grid mix containing coal, wind, and solar, as in Case 2. However, in the market-based method, the additional 10 kWh of carbon-free energy is now attributed to\ud835\udc3b1 instead of\ud835\udc3b2.\ud835\udc3b2 cannot claim this carbon-free energy even though it had originally invested in it, or there will be double counting."

The following section aims to show how to attribute carbon-free energy when these companies invest in physical or financial PPAs. Others [8] have also made similar observations.\nWe also show that lack of visibility into PPAs or RECs can cause mis-counting of the invested carbon-free energy in the electric grid.\n3.2.1 Case 1: Consider the same grid as earlier. The electricity consumers are a company\ud835\udc361 having a 20 MWh data center, and \ud835\udc3b1 (refer to Figure 4a). Without renewable investment, location- and market-based methods will attribute carbon-free energy proportional to consumption. That is, \ud835\udc361 and \ud835\udc3b1 will always receive 50% carbon-free energy, since wind contributes to 50% of the production. Since there is only one way the energy can be attributed, there is no scope for double counting or discrepancy.\n3.2.2 Case 2: Suppose \ud835\udc361 invests in an additional 20 MWh offsite solar farm that feeds the same grid via a physical PPA (refer to Figure 4b). Assuming the demand is still 1000 MWh, the coal plant reduces its production capacity to 480 MWh. Consequently, the carbon-free production in the grid increases from 50% to 52% due to the additional investment.\nIn the location-based method, the grid now has 52% carbon-free electricity, and thus both\ud835\udc361 and\ud835\udc3b1 have 52% carbon-free electricity in their consumption mix. However, in the market-based method, \ud835\udc361 can claim the solar energy exclusively and claim to be 100% renewable since the solar farm meets all its electricity demand. Since 20 MWh is already claimed by \ud835\udc361, the residual grid mix, which represents the mix of energy sources once energy associated with PPAs is removed, now has 500 MWh of wind and 480 MWH of coal. Since \ud835\udc3b1 did not invest, \ud835\udc3b1\u2019s electricity demand can only be met by the residual grid mix, which has 51% carbon-free energy after removing the contracted solar. However, in practice, \ud835\udc3b1 does not know that \ud835\udc361 has already been claimed when accounting for their consumption mix; they will doubly count the solar energy.\n3.2.3 Case 3: Finally, suppose \ud835\udc361 instead invests in a financial PPA, where the 20 MWh solar farm is connected to another grid (refer to Figure 4c). This situation is even trickier as the local grid mix does not change as there is no physical energy exchange between the grids, but the remote grid becomes browner when \ud835\udc361 claims the solar energy. In this case, the location-based method would attribute carbon-free energy similar to Case 1. In the market-based approach, \ud835\udc361 can still claim to be 100% renewable, although there is no physical delivery of electricity from the solar farm to its data center. Contrary to Case 2, \ud835\udc3b1\u2019s energy mix remains the same, with 50% of its consumption mix being carbon-free. However, consumers\nin the remote grid will see their electricity becoming browner and must remove the contracted solar energy when accounting for their fraction of carbon-free energy to avoid any double counting."

However, the gravity of this situation depends on the prevalence of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, in the grid that can potentially be contracted for carbon accounting purposes. We leverage a data-driven approach to assess the current state of the grid and its short-term trend of renewable adoption. We leverage data from electricityMaps [13] that provides us with the total energy generation as well as the individual generation from each energy source for 123 regions around the world. For this analysis, we isolate solar and wind energy generation as the two most common renewable energy sources contracted through PPAs.\nFigure 5 shows a scatter plot of total hourly energy production in a given region on \ud835\udc65-axis and the percentage of generation from solar + wind power plants in the region on \ud835\udc66-axis. There are two key takeaways from this analysis. First, a significant number of regions have a high renewable energy percentage. If a non-trivial portion of this solar and wind capacity is contracted out through PPAs and if these PPAs are not made visible publicly, there can be a significant potential for double counting. In the extreme cases, more than 70% of the total generation mix may be susceptible to this problem. Second, the high energy generation regions use solar and wind for a smaller portion of their energy demand. However, due to their size, even 10% renewable energy may be much bigger than 60% for a smaller region in an absolute sense. As a result, all the grid regions, irrespective of their low solar and wind percentage, are susceptible to the attribution problem.\nFigure 6 shows the cumulative density function of energy generation from solar + wind power in 2020 and 2022 for the same set of\nregions as Figure 5. Despite the short time duration and the impact of a worldwide pandemic, the percentage of energy from solar and wind increased significantly. As the world grapples with climate change\u2019s effects, the recent year\u2019s curve (orange for 2022) will keep moving downwards, complicating the energy attribution problem. Carbon-free energy attribution takeaway: The potential for discrepancies in carbon-free energy attribution is real for residential and commercial settings due to various organizations\u2019 lack of consensus and information on renewable investments. For example, according to ElectricityMaps\u2019 data, solar and wind contributed to 66.07% electricity generation in South Australia. If all the energy generated from solar or wind is purchased, all that electricity can be potentially double counted. The current state of the grid and its short-term trends suggests that more regions will be susceptible to the attribution problem."

We also have \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f \u2264 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60 from Equation 4. Thus, the market-based approach always favors the investors of carbonfree energy over non-investors, as their \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f is lesser.\nThe problem arises when information about the residual mix is not available in real-time or the residual mix is not calculated correctly. Any residential home or commercial organization trying to reduce their carbon emissions relies on third-party services to estimate the carbon intensity of their consumed electricity. However, current carbon information services that provide carbon intensity data mostly do not have information about the residual mix and provide location-based carbon intensity \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f . This happens mainly due to the lack of availability of real-time data \u2014 data about the residual grid mix often lags by years [3, 20] \u2014 but this is relatively common in the current scenario [19].\nDiscrepancies arise when some entities estimate their carbon intensity using these third-party services, whereas other entities that invested in renewables take green energy credit for such investment, leading to inaccurate carbon intensity estimation due to double counting. Even for one entity, if it claims the credit for its PPAs, but relies on these third party-services for carbon intensity estimation when the PPAs are insufficient to meet its demand, the calculated carbon intensity is incorrect as the invested carbon-free energy is counted doubly for the remainder of the energy needs."

            "text": "As explained in Section 3, when a portion of the grid\u2019s generation capacity is directly contracted (i.e., purchased) by end consumers, that energy purchase should be directly attributed to the purchasing customer and not be considered by the grid for computing carbon intensity. The carbon intensity of the residual energy mix (i.e., the mix of sources that remain after removing all contracted sources), will naturally be higher since the fraction of renewables in the residual mix will be smaller than in the total mix. This is highlighted in Figure 7, which depicts the increase in the carbon intensity of the residual mix with increasing amounts of contracted renewable energy. The figure uses electricity and carbon intensity data of four US regions (obtained from [13]). As shown, as the fraction of PPAs in various regional grids grows, so does the carbon intensity of the residual mix. In the case of California\u2019s CAISO grid, the\nThe higher carbon intensity of the residual mix also occurs when producers sell renewable energy certificates (RECs). Similar to PPAs, the buyer of these certificates gets the claiming rights to that energy production, and this is the case even when the buyer is not physically connected to the same grid. For example, Electricity Map data [32] showed that the electricity mix in Norway comprises 99% renewables when location-based methods are used. However, renewable generators in Norway sell their RECs to consumers in other countries (who are in physically disjoint grids), and after accounting for these RECs, the residual mix is only left with 15% renewable sources [3]. Importantly even though consumers in Norway consume nearly carbon-free electricity, they can not claim to be consuming green energy due to the sale of RECs by their suppliers. These discrepancies can result in challenges when performing carbon-aware optimizations, especially when there is a lack of visibility into market-based methods, as explained next. Key Takeaway: Lack of information about the real-time residual grid energy mix and standard method of attribution often results in discrepancies while estimating the carbon intensity of the grid. As discussed in Section 3, if all solar and wind electricity in South Australia is purchased, the residual carbon intensity of the grid becomes 370.22 g/kWh, whereas the carbon intensity of the grid, including solar and wind, is only 125.67 g/kWh. This is a 194 % increase in the grid carbon intensity; if not estimated correctly, these discrepancies can lead to gross overestimation of the \u201cgreenness\u201d of electric grids."

The computing industry has been at the forefront of this trend and has announced aggressive net-zero goals. For example, nearly all major public cloud providers have announced plans to run their data centers in a zero-carbon fashion by 2030 or sooner. Cloud providers have also begun exposing their cloud servers\u2019 carbon consumption to customers.\nThere has been significant research in recent years on how cloud providers and applications can leverage workload flexibility to react to temporal changes in carbon intensity to reduce their carbon footprint further. For example, cloud applications can shift their computations to periods of the day when the carbon intensity is the lowest, an approach known as temporal load shifting [38]. Others have looked at moving cloud workloads to cloud regions with the greenest electricity, called spatial load shifting [29]. Load-shifting techniques depend on accurate knowledge of how electricity\u2019s carbon intensity varies over time at a given cloud data center and how it differs across the cloud data centers of the cloud provider.\nOur previous sections have highlighted challenges in attributing carbon-free energy generation and estimating grid carbon intensity in the face of location- and market-based mechanisms. The lack of visibility into market mechanisms can hurt the cloud\u2019s carbon optimization efficacy. More generally, as such techniques become more prevalent in varied domains such as green electric vehicle (EV) charging, and flexible load shifting in buildings, the same problems faced by cloudworkloads today will be facedmore broadly.We highlight through data-driven examples the impact of these attribution and estimation challenges on decarbonization techniques."

Suppose a company \ud835\udc361 has data centers in CAISO and ISO-NE but has not invested in any PPAs in either of these regions. Instead,\ud835\udc361 depends on a third-party carbonintensity service to spatially load-balance requests to low-carbon regions and reduce their carbon emissions. The third-party service does not have information about the real-time residual grid carbon intensity and reports the carbon intensity of different regions with the total gridmix. Consequently, it reports that the CAISO is greener than ISO-NE since the carbon intensity of CAISO is lesser. Thus company\ud835\udc361 redirects all the requests from its data center in ISO-NE to its data center in CAISO and reports that it has reduced its carbon emissions by 18.3% per kWh of electricity consumed. However, this is double counting since\ud835\udc361 is following the location-based method, whereas other entities with PPAs have already claimed the carbonfree electricity using market-based method.\nIf all the entities follow a market-based approach, shifting requests to California would increase the carbon emissions for company \ud835\udc361 by 7.9%. In some scenarios, carbon-aware spatial load shifting that decreases emissions under location-based attribution (using the full energy mix) can increase emissions under marketbased attribution (using the residual energy mix)."

            "text": "Next, we show how a lack of knowledge about the residual grid mix can also hinder carbon-aware solutions that optimize their\ndemand within a region without involving other regions. In the residential sector, people are becoming increasingly carbon-aware and moving flexible loads like laundry, electric vehicle (EV) charging, etc., to low-carbon hours [23]. However, as the contracted carbonfree electricity sources are removed from the grid, the temporal variations in the carbon intensity decrease progressively. We show this phenomenon for CAISO in Figure 8. Consequently, there may be a significant discrepancy between the reported and actual carbon savings. For example, suppose Home \ud835\udc3b1 depends on the same third-party carbon intensity service as earlier to reduce the carbon emission of its electricity consumption. To do so, \ud835\udc3b1 delays doing laundry from hour 6 to hour 10, seemingly reducing their carbon emissions by 39.5%. However, the reduction is only 3% if all the renewables are already purchased and there is no double counting.\nThe problem is exacerbated if the third-party service forecasted that the grid carbon intensity will decrease, but the residual grid carbon intensity follows an opposite trend. Figure 9 shows a 24- hour period in California, where the residual grid carbon intensity increases when the total grid carbon intensity, including solar and wind, is supposed to be less. Suppose Home\ud835\udc3b2 has a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and a level 2 EV charger [36]. BEVs take around 10 hours to charge using level 2 chargers [36]. \ud835\udc3b2 follows a carbon optimization plan based on third-party forecasts and schedules their EV charging from hour 11 to hour 21. Home \ud835\udc3b1 then reports an average of 75.7 grams of carbon emission per kWh consumed electricity. Again, if there were no double counting, and everyone followed the market-based approach, Home\ud835\udc3b2 would have emitted 194.5 grams of carbon per kWh of electricity consumed in those hours, 118.8 grams/kWh more than reported. Not only is this a discrepancy of 156% carbon emission per kWh, but if \ud835\udc3b2 had full knowledge about the residual carbon intensity, they may have scheduled their EV charging at different hours."

Instead, \ud835\udc361 uses the same grid mix as everyone else. Thus, even if another company \ud835\udc362 uses third-party carbon intensity signals and shifts their electricity demand to low-carbon periods or regions,\nand even if there is double counting, there may actually be emission reduction since the electricity consumed from the grid is essentially low-carbon. However, there are three key takeaways:\n(1) Discrepancies in carbon intensity estimates make the situation appear greener than it should be, as highlighted in this section. (2) Carbon-optimized load shifting patterns will be different if everyone follows the market-based attribution approach than if everyone followed the location-based attribution approach. Which method results in more actual carbon emission reductions is beyond the scope of this paper and warrants further study. (3) Carbon-aware load shifting using a market-based method may also not always be as intuitive as shifting demand to low-carbon regions or periods. Since a region with high carbon-free energy will have high residual carbon intensity if all the carbon-free energy is contracted out, optimizers may opt to shift load away from this region instead of redirecting more load into the region."

Holzapfel et al. [21] show how using location-based and market-based accounting in parallel can lead to double counting and offers potential solutions against that. Google [19] also mentions double counting due to a lack of residual electricity data when they account for their carbon emissions. However, neither of these shows its effects. Contrary to the aboveworks, we show exampleswhere double counting can lead to inaccurate carbon emission reporting when carbon-optimization solutions do not account for the purchased electricity.\nBjorn et al. [8] discuss how inaccurate use of RECs and PPAs provides a sense of inflated emission reduction estimates, and our discussion on green energy attribution and carbon intensity estimation is similar to their work. However, we also show how this affects carbon-aware optimizations that follow these incorrect estimations and try to reduce operational carbon emissions.\nBrander et al. [9] and ElectricityMaps [31] highlight the pitfalls of market-based accounting and recommend using the location-based accounting method. We do not recommend any specific method in our paper. Instead, we show the inaccuracies in green energy\nattribution and carbon intensity estimation and the discrepancies between the actual and reported carbon emissions due to that. We also call for data availability and the development of newer algorithms that can handle 24/7 matching of carbon-free energy well to prevent any such scenario."

            "text": "If everyone follows only location- or market-based carbon accounting, there is no double counting [21], and the toy examples for double counting and reporting discrepancy we have shown in this paper will not apply. However, following only location-based carbon accounting is unlikely, given the increasing trend of buying PPAs and the push towards 24/7 carbon-free energy. For marketbased accounting, there is currently a need for both data availability and new algorithms to handle all the nuances. Currently, residual grid data is only available annually and lags for a few years [3, 20]. Data about PPAs, the amount of renewables removed from the grid due to such PPAs, and the residual grid mix are needed at an hourly scale if we are to move towards true decarbonization. Efforts are required from both the buyers and sellers of PPAs to make such data available in real-time and increase the visibility of the electrical grids and electricity markets.\nEven if data is available, there are other challenges since electricity consumed in a region is often a mix of locally produced and electricity imported from the nearby regional grids. The current consumption-based algorithms [1, 6, 12, 18, 22, 25, 28, 42, 43] are not well equipped to capture the effect of PPAs on the total and residual grid mix of a region, and this situation becomes more complex when electricity is imported from another region which itself has PPAs. Although there have been recent efforts in calculating the residual grid mix [26, 27], developing new algorithms to calculate the consumption-based CI at an hourly scale while considering PPAs is an essential future direction and one that needs our urgent attention. Once data is available, a hierarchical algorithm that calculates the residual mix by removing the renewables and then applying one of the existing techniques may be a reasonable first step towards accurate carbon-free energy attribution and correct emission reporting. Only when both the data and PPA-aware algorithms are available will current carbon-aware optimizations be able to truly reduce the carbon emissions associated with electricity consumption and lead towards a greener future."

To do so, these organizations increasingly use power purchase agreements (PPAs) to obtain renewable energy credits, which they use to offset their \u201cbrown\u201d energy consumption. However, the details of these PPAs are often not shared with grid operators and carbon information services, which monitor and report the grid\u2019s real-time carbon emissions. This leads to contracted renewables being double counted, which in turn causes a large discrepancy between the actual and the reported carbon emission savings of an organization \u2014 with the reported savings often overestimating the emission reductions.\nIn this paper, we explain how the current approaches to energy attribution can lead to such discrepancies.We also show that carbonaware load shifting following signals from these carbon intensity\nservices which do not have information about PPAs can actually increase the grid emissions in some cases. We hope our work raises awareness in the sustainable computing community about these challenges and leads to the development of newer robust algorithms and more visibility into the grid."
