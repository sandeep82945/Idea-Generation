    "abstractText": "There exists growing interest in understanding the dynamics of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to establish mechanistic links between individual patterns of spontaneous neural activation and corresponding behavioral measures in both normative and clinical populations. Here we propose and validate a novel approach in which whole-brain rs-fMRI data are mapped to a specific low-dimensional representation\u2014affective valence and arousal processing\u2014prior to dynamic analysis. This mapping process constrains the state space such that both independent validation and visualization of the system\u2019s dynamics become tractable. To test this approach, we constructed neural decoding models of affective valence and arousal processing from brain states induced by International Affective Picture Set image stimuli during task-related fMRI in (n = 97) healthy control subjects. We applied these models to decode moment-to-moment affect processing in out-of-sample subjects\u2019 rs-fMRI data and computed first and second temporal derivatives of the resultant valence and arousal time-series. Finally, we fit a second set of neural decoding models to these derivatives, which function as neurally constrained ordinary differential equations (ODE) underlying affect processing dynamics. To validate these decodings, we simulated affect processing by numerical integration of the true temporal sequence of neurally decoded derivatives for each subject and demonstrated that these decodings generate significantly less (p < 0.05) group-level simulation error than integration based upon decoded derivatives sampled uniformly randomly from the true temporal sequence. Indeed, simulations of valence and arousal processing were significant for up to four steps of closed-loop simulation (1t = 2.0 s) for both valence and arousal, respectively. Moreover, neural encoding representations of the ODE decodings include significant clusters of activation within brain regions associated with affective reactivity and regulation. Our work has methodological implications for efforts to identify unique and actionable biomarkers of possible future or current psychopathology, particularly those related to mood and emotional instability.",

            "text": "Emotional experiences unfold over time (Zelazo and Cunningham, 2007; Cunningham et al., 2013). Thus, knowledge of normative emotion processing dynamics may be particularly important for informing our understanding of mental wellbeing. Indeed, emotion dysregulation, which is implicated in\nmaladaptive trajectories of emotion processing, has been linked to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and other psychopathology (Berking and Wupperman, 2012). At present, however, we know little of the neural mechanisms through which emotion processing temporally evolves.\nAlong these lines, the elucidation of affect processing within the untasked brain has been an area of recent inquiry. Mind wandering is the default mode of human brain activity (Raichle et al., 2001), comprising as much as 47% of all wakeful cognitive states (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010). Interestingly, observations have been made in studies of mind wandering that show diverse, often negative, self-reported affective experiences (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010; Kragel et al., 2016). Evidence from a large-scale (n = 2,500) ecological momentary assessment study suggests that mind wandering is a cause, rather than an effect, of negative affect (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010). However, a brain-based mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon remains poorly described. Advancements in methods for analyzing resting state brain data, therefore, may hold promise in expanding our overall understanding of affect processing dynamics.\nNeural signatures of mind wandering are typically captured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) while the subject remains inactive, visually fixating on crosshairs, and under instructions to let the mind freely wander. Standard analysis methods currently utilize functional connectivity (FC) to characterize the temporal correlations between neural activations measured from disparate spatial regions throughout the brain. Using the FC approach, researchers have demonstrated that the functional organization of the resting brain broadly recapitulates task-related cognitive processing (Gordon et al., 2017), thereby allowing patterns of rs-fMRI brain activity to predict cognitive and behavioral states as well as to infer mechanisms of cognitive development (Dosenbach et al., 2010; Gu et al., 2015) and deficit states (Greicius et al., 2004, 2007; Cisler et al., 2013). It is this broad informing potential of rs-fMRI that prompted its inclusion in population-scale normative adult (Smith et al., 2013) and developmental (Brown et al., 2015; Casey et al., 2018) imaging studies.\nHowever, rs-fMRI temporal and spatial pattern analyses have inherent theoretical, conceptual, and interpretive limitations to their ultimate potential for improving our understanding of the mechanisms of mind wandering. First (in what we term the dynamics problem), existing rs-fMRI FC analyses largely rely on static topologies of functional brain organization (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009) in which steady-state network structures (e.g., default mode network) emerge from correlations between coarsegrained anatomical parcellations (Glasser et al., 2016) of fMRI BOLD signal (Buxton et al., 2004). Second (in what we term\nthe identity problem), fluctuating rs-fMRI patterns of neural activation lack defined cognitive process identities that directly relate individual and group variation to the extant task-related functional neuroanatomical literature, thus diminishing their potential value for informing our understanding of cognitive processes (and their interactions) within the untasked brain.\nHighly innovative work has recently approached the dynamics problem by decomposing the steady-state functional organization of the human brain into temporally finergrained, moment-to-moment dynamics of resting state FC reorganization (Liu and Duyn, 2013; Calhoun et al., 2014; Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2015), which appears strikingly similar to FC reorganization that has been observed when the brain alternates between tasks or between task and rest (GonzalezCastillo et al., 2015). This approach suggests that modes of resting state FC are governed, macroscopically, by a stochastic process (Parzen, 2015) such as a Markov chain (Privault, 2013; Kragel et al., 2021).\nRecent work has approached the identity problem by demonstrating that cognitive-like identities spontaneously and dynamically emerge within rs-fMRI data (Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2019). Further, advances in multivariate neural decoding (Mitchell et al., 2008) have provided insight into the specific cognitive process identities that are corollary to free-forming rs-fMRI neural activity. Both emotion processing (Kragel et al., 2016) and affect processing (Bush et al., 2018c) identities have been decoded from rs-fMRI data and independently validated, either by self-reported ecological affective experience (Kragel et al., 2016) or by concurrently recorded psychophysiology (Bush et al., 2018c).\nBuilding on these separate findings, we propose that innovative work must investigate methodologies that merge the analysis of resting state dynamics with specific cognitive identities in order to provide insight into the processing and regulatory mechanisms involved. One candidate approach that has embraced this exploratory framework was recently presented by Kragel et al. (2021). In this approach, a low-dimensional set of emotion identities (anger, contentment, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral) were neurally decoded from each timepoint of the subjects\u2019 rs-fMRI data and then subjected to dynamic analysis according to a Markov process, yielding the underlying probabilities of transitioning between each emotional identity. While this approach shed light on the critical link between emotion transition dynamics and psychopathology, it was limited by its inability to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the transition function.\nIn seeking a uniquely innovative approach to rs-fMRI dynamic analysis, this study explored the continuous dimensional space of affective valence and arousal rather than the discrete space of basic emotions. We applied previously reported, psychophysiologically validated neural decoding models of affective valence and arousal processing to characterize the affective experiences evolving within the untasked brain during rs-fMRI acquisition (Bush et al., 2018c). Next, we calculated the first and second temporal derivatives of the respective valence and arousal time-series and subsequently fit additional decoding models to these data. These decodings represent\nFrontiers in Neuroimaging | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 1 | Article 825105\nneurally constrained ordinary differential equations (ODE) underlying affect processing dynamics. The goal of this work was to test the validity of these ODEs in describing resting state affect processing dynamics and elucidate the functional neural correlates driving this dynamical system."

Both studies shared identical MRI acquisitions up to and including the resting state task data analyzed herein. In brief, the INCA and CTM studies were conducted across two sessions, each occurring on separate days. Within Session 1, participants were consented, screened for clinically relevant exclusionary criteria, and behaviorally assessed. Within Session 2, participants underwent a T1-weighted structural acquisition, two affect induction fMRI task acquisitions, and a resting state fMRI task acquisition, as well as two additional real-time fMRI task acquisitions, which are not part of this analysis. We have reported the details of this combined dataset and our analysis methods previously (Bush et al., 2020). For clarity of this current analysis, we explicitly report salient details of our participant sample as well as our neuroimaging acquisition and data processing pipelines."

Details of these task stimuli have been extensively reported (Bush et al., 2018a,c; Wilson et al., 2020). Image stimuli were presented according to two pseudo randomly sequenced trial types: implicit affect induction (90 images) and cued-recall/re-experiencing (Bush et al., 2020) (30 images). This analysis was informed by fMRI data acquired during implicit affect induction trials, which are characterized by a 2 s presentation of the image stimulus followed by an intertrial interval uniformly randomly sampled from the range 2\u20136 s during which a white fixation cross was presented on a black background. The Resting State task acquisition consisted of one 7.5min resting state fMRI scan in which a white fixation cross was displayed on a black background throughout.

In essence, the beta-series method permits the generation of a general linear model consisting of individual hemodynamic response function regressors for each task-related trial.

The extracted brain states were then paired with the IAPS normative scores associated with the individual stimuli and binarized to affective class labels {+1,-1}, respectively, for the valence and arousal dimensions of affect, according to the middle Likert score (5 on a 9-point scale). These brain states and class labels were then used as feature-label pairs to train linear support vector machine classifiers of affect processing using Matlab\u2019s fitcsvm function with default hyperparameters (i.e., solution via the Iterative Single Data Algorithm (Kecman et al., 2005), penalty = 1 for all misclassifications, and solution tolerance = 0.001).

            "text": "In this study, we applied neural decoding models of affect processing in order to characterize low-dimensional (valence and arousal) moment-to-moment affect processing dynamics (operationalized as temporal derivatives) that arise within the untasked human brain. We then constructed and validated neural decoding models of these derivatives, thus defining the neurally constrained ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that drive resting state affect processing dynamics. From these models, we made two important contributions to the affective neuroscience and neuroimaging literature. First, we demonstrated that the neurally-derived ODEs accurately simulated low-dimensional affect processing dynamics, thereby computationally validating our proposed novel framework for analyzing the dynamics of resting state fMRI data. Critically, our proposed approach used out-of-sample ensemble averaging to decode affect processing in hold-out subjects. Thus, our approach can potentially be scaled to resting state fMRI datasets for which no affect induction task-related fMRI data is available, and, therefore, no neural decoding models of affect processing could be constructed. Second, our approach allowed for the neurally-derived ODEs to be transformed to encoding models such that the neural correlates of affect processing dynamics could be identified. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first time the neurocircuits driving these dynamics have been observed. Overall, we found that affect processing dynamics are driven by widely distributed networks that differ between the valence and arousal dimensions of affect processing. We also found that several regions perform encoding roles across affective properties as well as orders of temporal dynamics.\nOverall, the identified encoding regions of affect processing dynamics overlap with well-established regions associated with the encoding of task-related affective reactivity and regulation, which include the sensory motor area (SMA), pre-SMA, dACC, dlPFC, vlPFC, amygdala, insula, and ventral medial PFC (Lindquist et al., 2012; Etkin et al., 2015). Our work adds additional context to these findings, providing a map of how activation in these regions may signal moment-tomoment changes in overall affective experience. Perhaps more intriguing is that we found the second derivative of affect processing dynamics to be more robustly encoded than the first derivative. Specifically, there is a greater total number of significant voxels present in the group-level neural encoding representations of the second derivative as visually depicted in both Figure 4 and the raw encoding maps. This finding was true across the independent dimensions of affective valence and arousal. At present, we hypothesize that this finding suggests one of two possibilities. First, this difference may suggest that one or more regions may encode both positive and negative instantaneous change. As specified, our decoding approach would not detect regions performing this processing role. Second, instantaneous affect processing change (first derivative) may require relatively less information processing relative to the second derivative. For example, second derivative dynamics are more indicative of regulation processes rather than a measure of system state, which may draw upon multiple levels of cognition such as goal formation, rule-set maintenance, and planning. Additional experimentation may be necessary to disambiguate the potential presence of these complex cognitions from the overall encoding of the second derivative that we depict here."

This framework may also, given representative sets of neural decoding models, provide a way of understanding group-level differences in cognitive processing dynamics, e.g., healthy vs. psychopathological populations, and may lead to novel biomarkers for characterizing psychopathologies. The framework could also be extended to pediatric populations if the challenge of significant motion artifact in these populations is overcome to therefore permit the building of high-quality decoding models.
