    "abstractText": "Erythromycin (EA) is an antibiotic whose concentration in water and wastewater has been reported to be above the standard levels. Since the methods used so far to remove EA from aquatic environments have not been effective, the development of effective methods for EA removal is necessary. In the present study, fly ash (FA)-based zeolite materials, which have not been investigated as EA sorbents before, were used. The possibilities of managing waste FA and using its transformation products for EA sorption were presented. The efficiency of EA removal from experimental solutions and real wastewater was evaluated. In addition, the sorbents\u2019 mineral composition, chemical composition, and physicochemical properties and the effects of adsorbent mass, contact time, initial EA concentration, and pH on EA removal were analyzed. The EA was removed within the first 2 min of the reaction with an efficiency of 99% from experimental solutions and 94% from real wastewater. The maximum adsorption capacities were 314.7 mg g\u22121 for the fly ash-based synthetic zeolite (NaP1_FA) and 363.0 mg g\u22121 for the carbon\u2013zeolite composite (NaP1_C). A fivefold regeneration of the NaP1_FA and NaP1_C showed no significant loss of adsorption efficiency. These findings indicate that zeolitic materials effectively remove EA and can be further investigated for removing other pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater.",

The presence of pharmaceuticals has been detected in surface water, groundwater, marine water, soil, and drinking water [1,2]. One group of pharmaceuticals that poses a major threat, primarily to aquatic environments, is antibiotics. The global consumption of antibiotics is 100\u2013200 thousand tons per year [3]. Antibiotics and their metabolites are water pollutants which create a growing and worsening problem due to their low degradation rate. Their decomposition time can vary from months to even several years depending on several parameters [4,5]. Antibiotic concentrations in water and wastewater have been found to reach values of around \u00b5g L\u22121 [6\u20138]. Depending on the chemical properties of the antibiotic, about 5\u201390% of the absorbed antibiotic dose is excreted as a metabolite or a parent compound [9] and then ends up in water [10]. Techniques used in municipal wastewater treatment plants aim to reduce the concentrations of suspended solids, organic carbon, heavy metals, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This is achieved by using a combination of mechanical, chemical, and biological processes.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 798. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28020798 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 798 2 of 20\nHowever, these processes are not capable of eliminating antibiotics from aqueous solutions. Antibiotics in wastewater can adversely affect biological treatment processes, in which microorganisms are essential for the desired functioning of the treatment plant. Many previous studies [11\u201313] have proven that the efficiency of the removal of antibiotics is not sufficient in wastewater treatment facilities. Therefore, these facilities are considered the primary sources of the environmental pollution caused by antibiotics. The effluents produced contain several metabolites and transformation products of antibiotics that are formed in addition to the parent compounds via various chemical reactions [14]. Inadequately treated municipal wastewater is one of the major causes of surface water pollution [15]. The presence of antibiotics in surface water can lead to adverse effects in aquatic organisms [16,17]. Recent studies have shown that several antibiotics are toxic to some organisms and thus pose a threat to the environment, ecological balance, and aquatic life [18]. This is because antibiotics affect, among others, the endocrine and genetic systems of aquatic organisms [19,20]. Moreover, the presence of antibiotics in drinking water has also been confirmed [21]. The prevalence of contaminants such as antibiotics in surface water and groundwater has also been recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency [22]. Erythromycin (EA) is an antibiotic with concentrations above standard levels in water and wastewater [23\u201328]. Therefore, the efficient removal of EA from wastewater is highly important. This subsequently requires new approaches and technologies that will prevent the accumulation of EA in the natural aquatic environment and reduce its adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. EA is classified as a first-generation nonpolyene macrolide antibiotic. Discovered and isolated by J. M. McGuire in 1952, it was introduced to the market in 1965. A strain of the Gram-positive bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea is responsible for obtaining EA; however, biosynthesis produces a mixture of EA isomers, i.e., EA A, B, and C. The name \u201cEA\u201d is reserved for the main product of biosynthesis, i.e., the A isomer (which has the highest antimicrobial activity), with the proportion of the B and C isomers making up no more than 5% each [29,30]. The basic element of the EA molecule is a 14-membered, macrocyclic lactone ring that does not contain double bonds. This is the aglycone part, called erythronolide. The molecule also contains two sugar substituents: 6-deoxyhexose derivatives, which are attached via glycosidic bonds to the ring. EA shows a slightly basic character (pKa = 8.89) and has five hydroxyl groups in its structure, which affects its affinity toward water (Table 1) [30].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 21\nreduce the concentrations of suspended solids, organic carbon, heavy metals, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.

In slightly alkaline solutions, its antibiotic activity is several times higher, whereas it is unstable in an acidic environment. In the latter case, it undergoes intramolecular cyclization through the formation of bonds between the carbonyl group at position C9 and the hydroxyl groups at positions C6 and C12. Moreover, in an acidic environment, EA is rapidly degraded by intramolecular cleavage of the water molecule [31]. To address the problem of antibiotics in wastewater, many conventional and advanced technologies have been developed [32,33]. Oxidation, electroprecipitation, membrane separation, coagulation\u2013flocculation, evaporation, floatation, and ion exchange have\nMolecules 2023, 28, 798 3 of 20\nbeen widely used, but these methods cannot effectively remove antibiotics from wastewater [23,24,34]. Adsorption has been identified as the best method for the removal of antibiotics [35]. It has the following advantages: less waste generation, suitability for both intermittent and continuous purification methods [36], applicability at low contaminant concentration levels, the possibility of regeneration and reuse, ease of operation, and low overall cost [37]. In addition, new low-cost adsorbents [38] such as activated carbon or nanoparticles that are used in treatment systems can be applied in the adsorption process [39]. For example, granular activated carbon (GAC) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) are the most commonly used materials to remove antibiotics via adsorption in secondary treatment systems in order to avoid the formation of transformation by-products [40,41]. Recent studies have shown that walnut shell-based activated carbon shows a high adsorption potential for metronidazole and sulfamethoxazole antibiotics, with maximum adsorption capacities of 107.4 and 93.5 mg g\u22121, respectively [42]. Micrograin GAC was used in a large-scale pilot experiment in a wastewater treatment plant in France. Thanks to the fluidized bed of activated carbon, both conventional parameters of the treated effluent were improved, and the concentrations of micropollutants were significantly reduced. Of the 31 pharmaceuticals and hormones analyzed, 26 were reduced by more than 50%, and compounds considered to be performance indicators of the treatment process were degraded by 78\u201389% [43]. PAC was also used to simulate water purification processes from endocrine-disrupting compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. After the use of PAC, almost one third of the 62 compounds were degraded to a high degree (>90%) and only eight had less than 50% removed [44]. Zeolites synthesized from fly ash (FA) and zeolite\u2013carbon composites meet the aforementioned criteria and can be used in adsorption processes. Zeolites have a three-dimensional crystal structure comprising AlO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra, which form cages and channels [45,46]. The crystal structure of zeolites is stable, allows for ion exchange, and accommodates water molecules, cations, and organic molecules [47,48]. These materials are characterized by high porosity and a large surface area. The shape of the pores directly affects their adsorption selectivity toward host molecules [49]. This study aimed to use zeolite (NaP1_FA) and zeolite\u2013carbon composite (NaP1_C) as potential adsorbents for EA removal. The studied adsorbents were produced from FA formed during coal combustion, which is an attractive alternative to ash. This makes the adsorbents low-cost materials that can be used to remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions [50\u201352]. The effects of many parameters, including contact time, adsorbent dose, and concentration, were investigated. The scanning electron microscope (SEM), N2 adsorption/desorption, x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) were used to characterize the studied adsorbents. The novelty of this work involves the use of two different fly ash-based adsorbents that show a high EA removal efficiency from both artificial and real wastewater. Moreover, these materials can be easily regenerated and reused without a significant decrease in their adsorption efficiency. In addition, this experimental study will undoubtedly increase the knowledge required for conducting further studies on a larger scale. The results of EA removal presented in this study were achieved for the first time using the sorbents NaP1_FA and NaP1_C."

XRD and FTIR Analysis\nThe synthesis of zeolites from the FA of different carbon contents resulted in the formation of zeolite NaP1_FA and zeolite\u2013carbon composite NaP1_C (Figure 1a). The diffractograms showed the presence of NaP1 zeolite as the main phase, with d spacing values of 7.10, 5.01, 4.11, and 3.18 \u00c5, which was accompanied by admixtures of unreacted\nMolecules 2023, 28, 798 4 of 20\nFA components, including mullite and quartz. The presence of amorphous substances, probably including amorphous silica in the NaP1_FA sample and carbon-rich material in the NaP1_C sample, was recognized by characteristic background increases ranging from 10 to 35\u25e62\u03b8. Previous studies have reported a similar mineral composition of zeolite NaP1_FA and zeolite\u2013carbon composite NaP1_C [53\u201355]. The FTIR spectra confirmed the observations made by XRD (Figure 1b). A wide, broad band of 3600 to 3100 cm\u22121 for both materials corresponded to the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups from the adsorbed water molecules in zeolite channels [56,57]. All materials showed clear bands at approximately 1644, 1424, and 738 cm\u22121. These can be attributed to the bending vibrations of H\u2013OH (indicating that the samples contain a fraction of free-state water adsorbed on the surface or inside the structural cavities), the O\u2013C\u2013O stretching vibration associated with carbonates and the stretching vibrations of the Si\u2013O\u2013Si/Si\u2013O\u2013Al bonds in the tetrahedra. A band at around 1090 cm\u22121 registered for NaP1_FA and NaP1_C may be attributed to the stretching vibration of C\u2013OH. The bands at 565\u2013567 cm\u22121 corresponded to the mullite admixture. As reported by [58], the presence of mullite is also confirmed by the presence of bands at 1099 and 811 cm\u22121. In the present study, the bands responsible for mullite were observed at 1085 and 802 cm\u22121 (NaP1_FA), and 1093 and 798 cm\u22121 (NaP1_C). The bands at 734\u2013738 cm\u22121 and 604 cm\u22121 were attributable to Si\u2013O\u2013Si/Si\u2013O\u2013Al and Al\u2013O/Si\u2013O bending vibrations, respectively [58]. As reported by [59], the bands at 738 and 690 cm\u22121 (weak band visible in Figure 1b) in the P1 zeolite are attributable to symmetric stretching vibrations of the internal tetrahedron. These authors have also stated that the band centered at 605 cm\u22121 (Figure 1b\u2014NaP1_FA) corresponds to the presence of a double ring in the P1 zeolite. The band vibration of the TO4 (T = Si or Al) tetrahedral in zeolite P1 was observed at 437 cm\u22121 (Figure 1b). These peaks agree well with the literature and confirm the successful synthesis of zeolite P1 [60,61]. Most importantly, a sharp band of high intensity at around 990 cm\u22121 observed for NaP1_FA and NaP1_C confirmed the formation of a well-defined aluminosilicate skeleton. These bands can be attributable to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of bridge bonds Si\u2013O(Si) and Si\u2013O(Al) in the zeolite frameworks.

The next decomposition effect started at 420 \u00b0C and led to a weight loss\nof ~36 wt.% for NaP1_C and ~4 wt.% for NaP1_FA.

In the present study, this range started at 300 \u00b0C and ended around 800 \u00b0C, which is attributable to the dehy-\ndroxylation of the OH group. The DTA curves showed exothermic peaks related to the oxidation of carbon species with maxima for NaP1_FA at 570 and 675 \u00b0C and for NaP1_C\nat 435 \u00b0C.

Above 900 \u00b0C, the synthesis of new phases took place, which was accompanied by an exothermic effect. The total mass losses\nfor NaP1_C and NaP1_FA were ~42 and ~14 wt.%, respectively (Figure 2).

The Effect of pH and Dosage\nThe experiments performed at different initial pH values allowed us to evaluate the changes in EA removal efficiency by the two zeolitic adsorbents (Figure 5a). A decline in the efficiency for the NaP1_FA material was observed following an increase in pH. Under acidic conditions (initial pH of 2.0), the removal was around 80%, whereas it was decreased to around 30% for a pH of 8.0. In contrast, pH did not affect EA removal by NaP1_C. A removal of around 80% was observed regardless of pH conditions. This may indicate that hydrophobic interactions dominate in the reaction of EA with NaP1_C, which is rich in carbon. On the other hand, larger amounts of the hydrophilic surface of NaP1_FA being available results in polar interaction with EA, which is sensitive to pH.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 21\nThe experiments perfor ed at di ferent initial pH values a lowed us to evaluate the\nchanges in EA removal efficiency by the two zeolitic adsorbents (Figure 5a).

The efficiencies of the EA removal processes from aqueous solutions were higher than in the present study: 93.71% for BSA/Fe3O4 and 83.71% for MWCNT [69,70]. Another adsorbent is MACC (nanocomposites obtained using the coprecipitation method), whose adsorption values of 178.52 mg g\u22121 were achieved using a dose of 0.001 g L\u22121, resulting in 54% EA removal [67]. The literature contains information on the use of porous magnetic graphene (PMG) and EA molecularly imprinted polymer (ERY@MIP) in the purification of EA aqueous solutions, which have adsorption capacities of 286 and 44.03 mg g\u22121, respectively [71,72]. In previous studies on EA removal, magnetic activated carbon adsorbents were used, with an adsorption capacity of 248.91 mg g\u22121 for a dose of 1.55 g L\u22121 [73]. EA was also removed using the nanomaterials MoS2 (molybdenum disulfide) and WS2 (tungsten disulfide). For doses of 1.0 g L\u22121, adsorption capacities of 57.10 mg g\u22121 for MoS2 and 190.31 mg g\u22121 for WS2 were obtained [74]. In recent years, EA removal has been studied using various materials (Table 5). In Table 5, a summary of NaP1_FA and NaP1_C adsorbents with significant adsorption efficiencies against EA is presented. This comparison shows that FA zeolite and zeolite\u2013 carbon composite can be alternatives to the other materials studied so far.\nThe dependency of the surface charge density of NaP1_FA and NaP1_C on solution pH value is presented in Figure 6. Potentiometric titrations indicated that the pH ZPC of both sorbents is about 3.0. This indicates that at a pH of 3.0, their surfaces are characterized by zero surface charge. However, while at pH < 3.0 the solid surface is positively charged, at pH > 3.0, it is negatively charged. At a pH higher than 3.0, both sorbents are negatively charged, and the surface negative charge density of NaP1_FA is almost twice that of NaP1_C at the same pH value. This relationship is correlated with the EA sorption efficiency, which is half for NaP1_FA of that of NaP1_C in alkaline media. EA has a pKa of 8.89, indicating\nMolecules 2023, 28, 798 10 of 20\nthat most of its molecules would be positively charged at pH < 8.89. This explains the relatively high sorption on negatively charged zeolite materials under these pH conditions. However, the electrostatic attraction seems to play a secondary role in the removal process, as NaP1_C shows a higher efficiency. This indicates the dominant role of hydrophobic interactions between the carbon component present in NaP1_C and the organic structure of EA. The latter is rich in methyl and methylene groups, thus leading to its hydrophobic nature. Such a mechanism is independent of solution pH. The more hydrophilic nature of NaP1_FA compared to NaP1_C results in lower P1 zeolite sorbing of EA, which is significantly worse than the zeolite\u2013carbon composite in alkaline media adsorption. On the one hand, the negative surface charge of NaP1_FA is twice that of NaP1_C, resulting in lower sorption. On the other hand, the carbon in the composite is responsible for the hydrophobic interactions, resulting in a less pH-dependent EA sorption on NaP1_C than on NaP1_FA.

EA adsorption occurred throughout the zeolite structure as well as in the micropores [46]. The removal of EA from wastewater (concentrations: 16.0 ng L\u22121 Stupava Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP); 37.0 ng L\u22121 Dev\u00ednska Nov\u00e1 Ves WWTP) using the Zeocem a.s. natural zeolite with three fractions was carried out using a 30-min contact time, and more than 90% removal was achieved for both WWTPs. According to studies conducted on wastewater, such a high efficiency was attributable to optimal pH conditions, which must be lower than the EA\u2019s pKa, i.e., 8.88. The highest efficiency of EA removal from wastewater was achieved using zeolites with the smallest fraction of 200 \u00b5m (WWTP Stupava: EA 94.7%, WWTP Dev\u00ednska Nov\u00e1 Ves: EA 98.5%). These results confirm that zeolites can be used as sorbents to remove EA from wastewater [81]. For zeolite Y, studies analyzing the EA adsorption efficiency were conducted using water collected at the outlet of a wastewater treatment plant in Ferrara (northern Italy), in which the actual EA concentration was 1.10 \u00b5g L\u22121. The results confirmed that 100% removal was achieved using this zeolite [46]."

EA Extraction from Municipal Wastewater\nFor the analyte extraction from the municipal wastewater matrix, solid-phase extraction (SPE) Oasis\u00ae HLB (Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance) columns filled with divinylbenzeneco-N-vinylpyrrolidone (Waters) were used. The bed is stable within the pH range of 0.0 to 14.0; therefore, it is a universal cartridge for the isolation of acidic, neutral, and alkaline compounds. In addition, it is necessary to use suitable analytical methods to determine the extent of environmental contamination with antibiotics such as EA. In most cases, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ESI mode (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was used. This method is powerful in terms of selectivity and sensitivity, allowing for the quantification of pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater at ng L\u22121 levels [30,83,84]. However, low concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater require an SPE.

The bed is stable within the pH range of 0.0 to 14.0; therefore, it is a universal cartridge for the isolation of acidic, neutral, and alkaline compounds. In addition, it is necessary to use suitable analytical methods to determine the extent of environmental contamination with antibiotics such as EA. In most cases, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ESI mode (LC-ESIMS/MS) was used. This method is powerful in terms of selectivity and sensitivity, allowing for the quantification of pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater at ng L\u22121 levels [30,83,84]. However, low concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater require an SPE. This allows for the necessary preconcentration of the target analytes and purification from the interferents present in the sample matrices [85].

            "text": "EA removal efficiency depends on several factors, both physical (related to the degree of wastewater treatment) and chemical (attributable to the composition of the aqueous matrix). However, the most important parameter in antibiotic adsorption methodology is the choice of appropriate adsorbent composition and process conditions. The authors have performed numerous laboratory experiments, which confirm that NaP1_FA and NaP1_C adsorbents are capable of efficiently removing EA from aqueous solutions. The maximum adsorption capacity predicted by the Langmuir model was 1.19 mg g\u22121 for NaP1_FA and 5.66 mg g\u22121 for NaP1_C. Adsorption was pH-dependent for NaP1_FA. In this case, for a low pH of 2.0, the adsorption efficiency reached 80%, and for a higher pH of 8.0, it decreased to about 30%. The effect of pH on efficiency was not observed for NaP1_C, where the EA removal efficiency was consistently around 80%. NaP1_C showed good EA removal efficiency over a wide pH range. This is highly beneficial from an implementation perspective in the treatment stage of wastewater, whose pH varies but is usually weakly alkaline. EA removal is also dependent on the adsorbent dose. The best results were achieved for the highest dose of 2.0 g L\u22121. The EA adsorption efficiency of NaP1_FA reached 11.75 mg g\u22121, whereas for NaP1_C, it was 17.75 mg g\u22121. Both adsorbents removed EA rapidly, and equilibrium was reached within the first 2 min of the reaction. Furthermore, a regeneration experiment of NaP1_FA and NaP1_C using ethanol was also carried out successfully. The adsorbents showed more than 90% EA removal efficiency after five regeneration cycles. The authors also tested the performance of these sorbents using wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant. The results of this study indicated that NaP1_FA and NaP1_C are effective adsorbents that can be used for the removal of antibiotic contamination (EA) in wastewater remediation.\nAuthor Contributions: A.G.: conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis, resources, data curation, writing\u2014review and editing, visualization; J.K.: methodology, formal analysis, investigation, writing\u2014review and editing, visualization; A.K.: methodology, formal analysis, investigation, writing\u2014review and editing, visualization; J.M.: conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis, writing\u2014review and editing, visualization, supervision; J.P.: methodology, formal analysis, writing\u2014review and editing, visualization; W.F.: conceptualization, supervision, project administration, funding acquisition; K.U.: methodology, investigation; T.B.: conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis, writing\u2014review and editing, visualization, supervision, project administration, funding acquisition.
