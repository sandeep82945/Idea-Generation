    "abstractText": "Charge imbalance in quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) causes emission degradation. Therefore, many studies focused on improving hole injection into the QLEDs-emitting layer owing to lower hole conductivity compared to electron conductivity. Herein, CuCo2O4 has a relatively higher hole conductivity than other binary oxides and can induce an improved charge balance. As the annealing temperature decreases, the valence band maximum (VBM) of CuCo2O4 shifts away from the Fermi energy level (EF), resulting in an enhanced hole injection through better energy level alignment with hole transport layer. The maximum luminance and current efficiency of the CuCo2O4 hole injection layer (HIL) of the QLED were measured as 93,607 cd/m2 and 11.14 cd/A, respectively, resulting in a 656% improvement in luminous performance of QLEDs compared to conventional metal oxide HIL-based QLEDs. These results demonstrate that the electrical properties of CuCo2O4 can be improved by adjusting the annealing temperature, suggesting that solution-processed spinel can be applied in various optoelectronic devices.",

            "text": "Quantum dots (QDs) have a size-dependent bandgap because of the quantum confinement effect; thus, the emission wavelength of QDs can be easily controlled using this property [1]. Inorganic QDs have narrower electroluminescence (EL) spectra and higher quantum yield (QY) than conventional organic light-emitting materials [2,3]. In addition, QDs have the advantage of low-cost mass production of quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) through solution-based manufacturing technology [4]. Owing to these advantages, QDs are in the spotlight as light-emitting layers for next-generation displays. To increase the emission performance of QLED, hole and electron injection/transport layers are inserted between the electrodes and the QD emitting layer (EML) [5]. Various studies are being conducted to employ transition metal oxides (TMOs) as the charge transport layer of QLEDs because TMOs have strong moisture and heat resistance. In particular, these studies applied p-type TMOs, such as CuO and NiO, as hole injection layers (HIL) or hole transport layers (HTL) [6\u20138], and n-type TMOs, such as ZnO and ZnMgO, as electron transport layers (ETL) [9,10] in optoelectronic devices.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 972. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16030972 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 972 2 of 15\nIn n-type TMOs, sufficient majority carrier electrons are generated owing to oxygen defects, and the conduction band maximum (CBM), which is the electron transport path, consists of metal s-orbitals [11]. Contrastingly, in p-type TMOs, majority carrier holes are generated in cation vacancies, which require high formation energy [12]. Moreover, the valence band maximum (VBM), which is the transport path of holes, mostly comprises a localized oxygen 2p orbital; thus, the hole conductivity is poorer than that of electrons in the amorphous structure [13,14]. For this reason, when solution-processed TMOs are used as a charge transport layer, it causes charge imbalance to decrease the luminous efficiency of the QLED [15,16]; therefore, studies on TMOs with high hole injection capability are necessary. Some studies reported that doping with p-type oxides increases hole injection [7,17,18]. Cao et al. improved the luminance of a QLED by up to 61,060 cd/m2 by doping Cu into a NiO hole injection layer [7]. However, hole injection through doping is limited because excessive doping can degrade the hole conductivity of p-type oxides [7,17,18]. Therefore, a new approach is required to increase the hole conductivity of p-type TMOs, such as ternary oxides or highly conductive crystal structures, for hole injection. The spinel structure has the general formula AB2O4, where A is a divalent metal ion (Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+) in the tetrahedral sites and B is a trivalent metal ion (Co3+, Al3+, Fe3+) in the octahedral sites (Figure S1) [19\u201321]. Ternary oxides with spinel structures can be alternatives to many oxides because their optical and electrical properties can be tuned by changing the combination of the metal ions [22]. Spinel oxides have the relatively low activation energy for electron transfer between different cations [23,24]. Thus, spinel oxides such as CuCo2O4 and NiCo2O4 have a conductivity of several tens of S/m, and these electrical conductivity values of spinel oxides are much higher than that of binary oxides [25,26]. In the field of photovoltaics, many studies have been conducted using spinel oxides with superb conductivity as charge transport layers [14,19,27]. However, research on spinel oxides is relatively unusual in the QLED field; therefore, it is especially notable that this study improved hole injection using spinel ternary oxides. In this study, we fabricated highly conductive p-type CuCo2O4 via a solution process using the spin-coating technique and applied it as a HIL to enhance the charge balance of QLEDs. Substantial variations in the oxygen defects were observed in the solution-processed CuCo2O4 thin films depending on the annealing temperature. The oxygen defect affected the hole concentration; as a result, the VBM of CuCo2O4 shifted away from EF as the annealing temperature decreased. When CuCo2O4 was annealed at 200 \u25e6C, the QLED performance was improved, and the hole injection was enhanced through better energy-level alignment. To investigate the reason for the difference in CuCo2O4 electrical characterization according to the annealing temperature, Hall measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted. In addition to confirming the hole-injection ability of CuCo2O4, a hole-only device (HOD) was manufactured and measured. These results demonstrate that the electrical properties of CuCo2O4 can be adjusted by modifying the annealing temperature, suggesting that solution-processed spinel can be applied in various optoelectronic devices."

The relationship between the resistivity (\u03c1), conductivity (\u03c3), mobility (\u00b5), carrier concentration (n), and electrical charge (q) of the carriers in metal oxides is shown in Equation (3) [28]:\n1 \u03c1 = \u03c3 = nq\u00b5 (3)\nThe conductivities of CuCo2O4-200 and CuCo2O4-300, calculated using Equation (1), were 0.4357 S/cm and 2.553 S/cm, respectively. The difference in electrical conductivity of CuCo2O4-200 and 300 were predominantly caused by the hole concentration because the difference in mobility between the two thin films is not significant. Hall measurement results show that both CuCo2O4-200 and CuCo2O4-300 films have relatively enough high electrical conductivity compared to conventional oxides; therefore, the CuCo2O4 HIL is expected to greatly contribute to hole injection. However, the hole concentration of CuCo2O4 thin films vary according to the annealing temperature. Therefore, it is expected that the QLED performance depends on the annealing temperature of the CuCo2O4 HIL owing to the difference in energy level alignment of CuCo2O4 HILs. Figure 1 displays the O 1s, Cu 2p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 core-level XPS spectra of ITO/CuCo2O4 at different annealing temperatures of 200 \u25e6C and 300 \u25e6C. The binding energies of the XPS spectra were calibrated using the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon (284.6 eV as a reference). The O 1s core level was separated into oxide peaks, oxygen vacancies, surface hydroxyl oxygen, and carbonyl oxygen. As seen in Figure 1a,b, more oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl oxygen peaks were observed in the CuCo2O4-200 specimen than in the CuCo2O4-300 specimen, which means that more oxygen defects occurred. The tendency of oxygen defects in the CuCo2O4 to increase at the lower annealing temperature is similar to reported solution-processed metal oxides [29,30]. Cu+ ions do not cause satellite peaks because the 3d orbitals are all filled with electrons, whereas Cu2+ ions have [Ar] 3d9 electron structures, which cause 2p\u21923d transitions with the result that satellite peaks are observed in XPS measurement [31\u201334]. As seen in Figure 1c,d, two satellite peaks were identified at 940 eV and 943 eV, except for the main peak at 933 eV in the Cu 2p3/2 core level. Therefore, the Cu 2p3/2 XPS spectra can be separated into Cu+, Cu2+, Cu(OH)2, and two satellite peaks (Sat1 and Sat2), and the ratio of Cu+ to Cu2+ can be expressed as Equations (4) and (5), respectively [19,35,36].\nCu+(%) = Cu+\nCu+ + Cu2+ + Cu(OH)2 + Sat1 + Sat2 \u2217 100 (4)\nMaterials 2023, 16, 972 5 of 15\nCu2+(%) = Cu2+ + Cu(OH)2 + Sat1 + Sat2\nCu+ + Cu2+ + Cu(OH)2 + Sat1 + Sat2 \u2217 100 (5)\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 15\nlevel. Therefore, the Cu 2p3/2 XPS spectra can be separated into Cu+, Cu2+, Cu(OH)2, and two satellite peaks (Sat1 and Sat2), and the ratio of Cu+ to Cu2+ can be expressed as Equations (4) and (5), respectively [19,35,36].

Co3+ and Co2+ ions also generated satellite peaks owing to the 2p\u21923d transition. Therefore, the Co 2p3/2 XPS spectra in Figure 1e,f can be separated into Co3+, Co2+ and two satellite peaks (Sat 1, Sat 2); the ratio for each ion can be expressed by Equations (6) and (7), respectively [37].\nCo3+(%) = Co3+ + Sat1\nCo2+ + Co3+ + Sat1 + Sat2 \u2217 100 (6)\nCo2+(%) = Co2+ + Sat2\nCo2+ + Co3+ + Sat1 + Sat2 \u2217 100 (7)\nIn the case of the CuCo2O4-200 and CuCo2O4-300, the Co3+ ion ratios were 70.9% and 72.3%, respectively. In p-type metal oxides, oxygen vacancies reduce the number of hole carriers, which has a significant influence on the electrical properties of the oxides [12,38]. The XPS measurement indicates that the solution-processed CuCo2O4 has no significant change in Cu and Co metal ion composition according to the annealing temperature change; nevertheless, there is a significant change in the oxygen defect. The O 1s peak measurements show that more oxygen defect sites were generated by low-temperature annealing in CuCo2O4-200. Therefore, we can expect that the hole concentration in CuCo2O4-200 is less than that in CuCo2O4-300. These results show the same tendency as the Hall measurement results, in which CuCo2O4-200 exhibited a lower hole concentration. Figure 2 shows an AFM topography image of the CuCo2O4 thin films with different annealing temperatures measured in the non-contact mode. As shown in Figure 2a, the CuCo2O4-200 thin film has low crystallinity, whereas the CuCo2O4-300 thin film in Figure 2b shows that both the size and number of particles increased. Root mean square (RMS) value of CuCo2O4-200 and -300 thin films were measured to be 0.17 nm and 0.46 nm, respectively. The uniformity of the film formation seems to be the reason why the CuCo2O4-200 thin film had a higher hole mobility than CuCo2O4-300 (Table 1). As the CuCo2O4 annealing temperature decreased, crystallinity also decreased. Therefore, the low crystallinity of CuCo2O4-200 is a major factor in increasing the number of oxygen defect sites.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 15\nCo2+ and two satellite peaks (Sat 1, Sat 2); the ratio for each ion can be expressed by Equations (6) and (7), respectively [37].

As shown in Figure 3a, the transmittance (%) of the CuCo2O4 films decreased as the annealing temperature was increased. Especially, the transmittance of CuCo2O4-200 and -300 samples was measured to be 91.1% and 88.4% respectively, in the 530 nm region, which is the QLED emission wavelength. The Tauc plots for the CuCo2O4 thin films annealed at different temperatures are shown in Figure 3b. The spinel oxides include divalent metal ions (M2+) and trivalent metal ions (M3+), and, thus, conduction bands formed by the 3d orbitals of M2+ and 3d orbitals of M3+ exist, respectively. Because both O 2p\u2192M2+ 3d and O 2p\u2192M3+ 3d transitions are generated, spinel oxides have two bandgap energies [39\u201342]. Eg1 and Eg2 in Figure 3b are the optical bandgaps generated by the O 2p\u2192M2+ 3d and O 2p\u2192M3+ transitions, respectively. The optical bandgap of CuCo2O4-200 with spinel structure was measured at 1.36 eV and 2.15 eV, and the bandgap of CuCo2O4-300 was measured at 1.32 eV and 2.13 eV. According to prior studies on spinel cobalt oxide, the crystallinity increases as the annealing temperature increases, whereas the bandgap and transmittance will decrease. The optical characterization of the CuCo2O4 covered in this study showed the same tendency as previous studies on spinel oxides [43]. Through UV-visible spectroscopy measurement results, owing to the low crystallinity of CuCo2O4-200, it was confirmed that the CuCo2O4-200 transmittance was higher than that of CuCo2O4-300 and, consequently, more suitable for QLED.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 15\nThe optical characteristics of the CuCo2O4-200 and -300 films were measured by UVvisible spectroscopy.

In Figure 4a, the graph on the left shows the work function measurement based on the kinetic energy of electrons in the secondary-electron cutoff region. In Figure 4a, the graph on the right shows the energy difference between the Fermi energy level (EF) and the VBM or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) through the binding energy of electrons. The work functions of samples ITO/CuCo2O4-200, ITO/CuCo2O4-300, ITO/CuCo2O4-200/TFB and ITO/CuCo2O4-300/TFB were measured to be 4.87 eV, 4.94 eV, 4.68 eV, and 4.69 eV, respectively, then the VBM (or HOMO) were measured to be 0.30 eV, 0.11 eV, 0.79 eV, and 0.81 eV, respectively. The optical band gap of TFB was estimated using the Tauc plot (Figure S3). The work function difference and HOMO level difference between the TFB thin film formed on CuCo2O4-200 and formed on CuCo2O4-300 were 0.01 eV and 0.02 eV, respectively, and these were not significant. However, in the CuCo2O4 HILs, an energy level difference appeared when the annealing temperature changed, and the VBM in particular changed significantly. The CuCo2O4-300 HIL has few oxygen defect sites owing to its high crystallinity, which increases the hole concentration and correspondingly reduces the gap between the VBM and EF levels. Contrastingly, the CuCo2O4-200 HIL has many oxygen defect sites, which decreases the hole concentration and correspondingly increases the gap between the VBM and EF levels. As shown in Figure 4b, the difference between the CuCo2O4-300 VBM and TFB HOMO levels was 0.7 eV, whereas the difference between CuCo2O4-200 and TFB HOMO levels was 0.49 eV, which is relatively small. The UPS measurement results suggested that the CuCo2O4-200/TFB structure was more suitable for the device in terms of hole injection. To confirm the degree of hole injection in actual devices according to the CuCo2O4 HILs annealing temperature, the J-V characteristics were measured by manufacturing an HOD of the ITO/CuCo2O4/TFB/Al structure, as displayed in Figure 5a. An EOD with an ITO/ZnO/Al structure was also fabricated to compare the injection and transport properties of the electrons and hole carriers. Figure 5b shows that more current flows in the EOD than in the HOD, which can be expected based on the characteristics of holes and electrons. Remarkably, the current density of the HODs using the ternary metal oxide CuCo2O4 HIL was nearly 100 times higher than that of the binary metal oxide CuO. In addition, as expected from the UPS measurement results, it can be confirmed that hole injection increases in the CuCo2O4-200 HOD, which exhibits suitable energy alignment with the TFB. Therefore, we expect that the CuCo2O4 HIL can improve the performance of QLEDs owing to its high hole injection ability, and in particular, that CuCo2O4-200 HIL QLEDs will have the highest performance."

Furthermore, as expected, the energy barrier between CuCo2O4-200 VBM and TFB HOMO was smaller than that of CuCo2O4-300, which was advantageous in terms of hole injection, and the CuCo2O4-200 HIL QLED had the highest performa ce.

However, the current density of the CuO HIL QLED rapidly increased after turning on the device, whereas the CuCo2O4-based device showed a gradual increase rate of the current density due to a decrease in the leakage current of the device. Therefore, the current efficiency was higher for QLEDs with CuCo2O4 HIL than CuO HIL and a narrow FWHM could be realized, allowing higher color purity of the device.

The electrical properties of CuCo2O4 comprising Cu2+ and Co3+ cations were measured using Hall measurements, and it was confirmed that they have higher conductivity than common p-type binary oxides. In particular, the difference in the hole injection ability of CuCo2O4 according to the annealing temperature was identified using XPS, UPS, and the fabricated HOD. It was confirmed that the VBM of CuCo2O4 shifted away from the Fermi energy level (EF) as the annealing temperature decreased, resulting in enhanced hole injection through better energy-level alignment. The CuCo2O4 HODs had a significantly higher current density than the CuO HOD, and in particular, the hole injection ability of the CuCo2O4-200 HOD was superior to that of the CuCo2O4-300 HOD, as expected from the perspective of energy alignment. Maximum luminance and maximum current efficiency of the CuCo2O4-200 HIL QLED were 93,607 cd/m2 and 11.14 cd/A, respectively, resulting in a 656% improvement in luminous performance of QLEDs compared to the CuO HIL QLED owing to increased hole injection.
