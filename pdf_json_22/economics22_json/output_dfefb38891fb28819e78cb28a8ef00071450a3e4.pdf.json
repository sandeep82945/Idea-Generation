Email: christos.livas@dentalclinics.nl\ninteraction and search volume (Livas et al., 2018; SycinskaDziarnowska et al., 2021; Ustdal and Guney, 2020).\nAs increasingly more individuals seek information on the Internet for health-related decisions before accessing healthcare services (Montemurro et al., 2015), and mainly through a general search engine (Fox, 2006), it is likely that such searches will be initiated on a massively visited platform such as Google Search, simply known as Google (Google LLC, Alphabet, Mountain View, CA, USA). Google processes, on average, more than 40,000 search queries every second, which corresponds to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide (Mavragani et al., 2018).\nAnalysis of Web search data using Google Trends (GT), a freely accessibly online portal that surveys and ranks the online popularity of search terms and topics, may provide valuable insights into human behaviour and needs (Internet World Stats, 2021). More specifically, GT performs custom searches adjusted by geographic location (worldwide or distinct countries), time frame (last hour/4 hours/day/7 days/30 days/90 days or custom time range starting from 2004), categories (including arts and entertainment, beauty and fitness, business and industrial, finance, health and science among others) and search type (image, news, Google shopping, YouTube). In this perspective, leveraging data from health information queries in Google may enable healthcare policymakers and providers to be compatible with emerging population trends and demands (Shen et al., 2020).\nWith the exception of the spring lockdown in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Invisalign queries in the Google search engine increased steadily globally between 2016 and 2021 as indicated by GT data (SycinskaDziarnowska et al., 2021). However, online health-related search behaviour may differ between users from developed and developing countries due to discrepancies in social, economic, cultural and psychological backgrounds (Cruvinel et al., 2019). Therefore, the aims of the present study were to investigate the long-term changes in the interest levels of Google users related to Invisalign among countries with socioeconomic and cultural disparities as well as possible seasonal effects."

To compare RSVs among the 10 countries over the years, linear regression analysis and the StudentNewman-Keuls (SNK) test for multiple comparisons were conducted. The SNK test is one of the most widely used multiple comparison tests, known to have a better power than the Tukey test and the Scheffe test (Zolman 1993), and holds the familywise error rate to alpha (Type I error). All of the statistical analyses were performed using Language R version 4.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

For example, USA, Australia and Italy showed higher RSVs than the Philippines, Brazil and Thailand (Figure 3). However, fairly recently, the developing countries displayed higher RSVs than the developed countries (Figure 4). Nevertheless, a slight decline in RSVs was observed after January 2020 in Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Thailand (Figure 5). There was no meaningful pattern when the trends were compared either on a monthly or quarterly basis. Seasonal variations were different among most of the examined\ncountries.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "In general, the present study demonstrated the high popularity of Invisalign and the public\u2019s need for relevant information across countries regardless of socioeconomic conditions. Developed countries exhibited significantly higher RSVs but developing countries have surpassed developed countries in that respect in recent years. These results may imply the extensive demand for Invisalign in socioeconomically advantaged countries and, at the same time, the great growth potential in disadvantaged countries despite the less optimal starting interest levels. The minor decrease in Internet users\u2019 searches observed in four out of five developing countries after January 2020 may be attributed to the tightened social restrictions and lockdown measures in fear of COVID-19 spread that affected more severely the economies of less-privileged countries than higher-income countries (Gottlieb et al., 2021). This might be the case for Mexico, the Philippines and Thailand, which present the lowest adjusted per national income per capital in the 10-country list of the study (The World Bank, 2021). A more significant decline in online interest for Invisalign and braces-associated terms has been reported by a recent GT-based study (Sycinska-Dziarnowska et al., 2021).\nNevertheless, overlapping of the search results due to the selected keywords in that study might have inflated the magnitude of the change in Google search traffic (Livas and Delli, 2021).\nHypothetically, the study implications may be generalised to all CAT systems, seeing that Invisalign has been found to be the most frequently used search term for orthodontic clear aligners in the Google search engine (Ustdal\nand Guney, 2020). Thus, training on CAT procedures in dental school curricula and orthodontic residency programmes needs to be reinforced to keep up with the rising global interest. At the practice level, continuous professional development in this treatment method will help practitioners upgrade clinical skills according to the latest advances and run profitable offices. Given the utility of behavioural research in planning and improving personcentred care (Cruvinel et al., 2019), the current findings may point out the need for health insurance companies to revise their reimbursement policies to cover CAT costs in a wider range of plans.\nIn spite of the fact that adult orthodontics is becoming more common, practice revenues are still largely driven by adolescent patients (McIver, 2016). In this context, the similarities in seasonal variation observed here might be closely related to the academic calendar of each country as the heights of these peaks seem to coincide with the summer and winter school vacations. Comparable seasonality patterns have been previously identified in the number and age distribution of patients seeking orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery with the younger ones, likely students, visiting orthodontic settings during their summer and winter breaks (Lee et al., 2020; Lim et al., 2017). Likewise, a smallscale study in dental and orthodontic practices in the United States revealed that new patient flow may be expected at the end of summer when families are getting settled for the new school year (McIver, 2016.) With respect to the sales seasonality trends during the winter months, an uptick in orthodontic revenues can occur in December and January,\nprobably due to patients trying to take advantage of expiring or new orthodontic insurance benefits (McIver, 2016).\nThe advantages and disadvantages of the study are mainly related to the GT tool itself. Users\u2019 characteristics and intentions cannot be identified, while the exact mechanisms employed by Google to generate and analyse search data are not known (Nuti et al., 2014). By definition, GT does not capture total Internet traffic but, still, it refers to 92.26% of the available search engines (Alex, 2021). On the positive side, GT is considered the prevailing behaviour analytics tool using Web-based search datasets. It allows anonymous and objective real-time data collection decreasing the reporting bias observed in surveys, as well as methodological standardisation for inter-study comparison (Lotto et al., 2017). To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study in orthodontics to combine GT and time series analysis. By eliminating the noise within the time series data, time series analysis can disclose more information than a cursory observation of data (Lim et al., 2017). Finally, and in view of the problematic reporting of methodology in GT literature, the recommended checklist for the documentation of search strategy by Nuti et al. (2014) was adopted in this investigation to strengthen replicability of the results. Understanding sales seasonality enables practitioners to decide effectively about when to undertake hiring, capital improvements and to ease the anxiety caused by predictable fluctuations in practice revenues (McIver, 2016). Nonetheless, it needs to be acknowledged that seeking information on the Internet is not necessarily translated directly into a practice visit but may indicate personal intention to undergo treatment with Invisalign in the future or interest in treatment details for family members or friends. Thus, it will be beneficial to investigate sales seasonality in orthodontic practices in developed and developing countries in combination with GT-based data regarding CAT systems and other treatment techniques."
