Cross-Sector Collaboration Models for Elderly Care Service Delivery: Investigate the impact and efficacy of various cross-sector collaboration models between government, private institutions, and the public in the delivery of elderly care services. This could involve comparative studies across different regions or countries to identify best practices and challenges in fostering synergistic relationships among stakeholders.

Taxation and Consumer Guidance as Regulatory Tools: Extend the current model to include taxation and consumer guidance as additional regulatory tools employed by governments. This research would explore how these tools, alone or in combination with penalties and subsidies, influence the quality of elderly care services, market stability, and the strategic behavior of care institutions.

Impact of Technology and Innovation on Elderly Care Service Regulation: With the growing integration of technology in healthcare and elderly care, future research could focus on how technological advancements, such as digital monitoring, telemedicine, and smart elderly care solutions, affect the dynamics of the tripartite game model. This includes the role of technology in enhancing service quality, government regulation, and public participation.

Behavioral Economics Perspectives on Elderly Care Service Choices: Utilize principles from behavioral economics to understand the decision-making processes of elderly care service providers and the public. This could involve studying the psychological factors and biases that influence the strategic choices of private elderly care institutions and the effectiveness of government interventions aimed at promoting high-quality service delivery.

Sustainability and Long-Term Care Infrastructure Development: Explore the sustainability of elderly care service models under different regulatory mechanisms, with a focus on long-term infrastructure development and investment. Research could assess how dynamic subsidy and penalty mechanisms influence the long-term sustainability of the elderly care market, including the development of infrastructure, staff training, and quality of care standards.
