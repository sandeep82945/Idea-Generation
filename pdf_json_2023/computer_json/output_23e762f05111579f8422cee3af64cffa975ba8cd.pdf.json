    "abstractText": "In this manuscript, we investigate the cosmological and thermodynamic aspects of the Brans\u2013Dicke theory of gravity for a spatially flat FRW universe. We consider a theoretical model for interacting Kaniadakis holographic dark energy with the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff. We deal with two interaction scenarios (Q1 and Q2) between Kaniadakis holographic dark energy and matter. In this context, we study different possible aspects of cosmic evolution through some well-known cosmological parameters such as Hubble (H), deceleration (q), jerk (j), and equation of state (\u03c9d). For both interaction terms, it is observed that the deceleration parameter exhibits early deceleration to the current accelerating universe and also lies within the suggested range of Planck data. The equation of state parameter shows quintessence behavior (for the first interaction term) and phantom-like behavior (for the second interaction term) of the universe. The jerk parameter represents consistency with the \u039bCDM model for both interaction terms. In the end, we check the thermodynamic behavior of the underlying model. It is interesting to mention here that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds for both cases of interaction terms.",

            "text": "The most mysterious and persistent problem in today\u2019s cosmology is the current accelerated expansion of the universe. It is widely recognized that the universe underwent a late-time transition from the epoch of matter to the phase of accelerated expansion. Well-known observational data, such as gravitational lensing [1], Ia supernovae [2,3] and cosmic microwave background radiation [4,5], provide authentic evidence that we are in this transition phase. Dark energy (DE) [6\u20138] plays a prominent role in this expansion due to its negative pressure. The first candidate to describe this repulsive force is a cosmological constant, whose equation of state parameter is -1. Unfortunately, this simplest candidate has faced well-known problems, such as fine-tuning and the cosmological constant problems [9,10]. Therefore, researchers are trying to identify the candidate for DE that not only explains the current accelerated expansion of the universe but also addresses the above-mentioned problems. The theory of dark energy (DE) with negative pressure has received much recognition among the existing theories that attempt to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. There are two basic ways to account for the universe\u2019s late-time accelerated expansion. The first choice is the dynamical DE theories, which are proposed by modifying the matter part of the Einstein-Hilbert action. Several dynamic DE models have been proposed, including quintessence [11,12], k-essence [13,14], phantom [15,16], Chaplygin gas [17,18] and holographic DE (HDE) [19]. These models are designed to explore the nature of DE and resolve issues such as cosmic coincidence and fine-tuning. A second approach is alternative theories of gravity that are obtained from the geometrical part of the\nEntropy 2023, 25, 576. https://doi.org/10.3390/e25040576 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nEinstein-Hilbert action and include some extra degrees of freedom that can drive the universe\u2019s accelerated expansion [20\u201325]. The basic alternative theories of gravity include f (R) (where R denotes the Ricci scalar) [26], f (T) (T denotes the torsion scalar) [27], f (G) (G is the Gauss-Bonnet term) [28], Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified Gravity [29], Brans\u2013Dicke (BD) theory [30,31], and others. The BD theory (more generally the scalar-tensor theory) is considered the best candidate, alternative to general relativity. In this natural modification, the non-minimal coupled scalar field is replaced by Newtons gravitational constant [32,33]. This theory addressed major cosmological issues such as inflation, quintessence and the cosmic expansion of the universe. Well-known braneworld scenario has been investigated in the context of this higher dimensional theory. Moreover, BD theory concerns the geometrical nature of the scalar field which is considered an attractive feature of this theory. In this BD theory with a chameleon scalar field, the scalar potential and the matter field emerge from the geometry of the extra dimensions rather than some ad hoc assumptions, is an appropriate and fundamental alternative to the standard BD theory [34\u201338]. Wesson and Ponce de Leon [39] induced matter theory, where contends that the additional parametric terms resulting from the added dimension Einstein\u2019s 5D equations can also be connected with an efficient energy tensor in 4D theory was inspired by this disparity between a fine marble of geometrical as well as the low-grade wood of matter. They observed that the 4D non-vacuum universe is similar to the 5D vacuum universe, geometrically seen by [39]. By using the induced matter theory, a modified BD theory is defined as a 4D BD theory with a self-interacting potential and an efficient matter field. Further, Rasouli et al. [40] also established a modified BD (MBDT) theory in which the matter and and potential are entirely emerge from geometry rather than being introduced into the action via ad hoc assumption. In [41], authors investigated the cosmological aspects of Barrow HDE in the framework of BD cosmology. They Considered both interaction and non-interaction scenarios and checked the stability analysis. They found the consistency of the underlying model. Amani and Halpern [42] checked the energy conditions in a modified BD gravity. Ghaffari [43] studied the cosmological consequences of non-interaction Kaniadakis HDE (KHDE) in the context of BD gravity. He found some cosmological parameters and obtained the ranges that are compatible with observations. Among several DE models, the HDE model and its modified families as Tsallis HDE [44], R\u00e9nyi HDE [45] and Barrow HDE [46] are used in literature to illustrate how the cosmos is expanding. Initially, Li [19] developed the energy density of HDE model to describe the accelerated expansion, which is driven with help of the holographic principle [18,47\u201349]. The HDE model is a viable method for resolving DE issues. The holographic theory is based on the system that expresses the scale for a system\u2019s number of degrees of freedom is primarily determined by the area that was taken into consideration. The interesting cosmic implications of HDE are also confirmed to be in line with observations [50\u201353]. The basic concept for the formation of HDE is the relationship between the entropy of the system and geometric factors such as its radius. The common entropy is the BekensteinHawking entropy, which is used in cosmology and black holes and is obtained from the fundamental Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. The Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, however, has been generalized by Kaniadakis into a one-parameter concept known as Kaniadakis entropy [54,55]. It is the consequence of a coherent and self-consistent dynamical statistical theory, that maintains the fundamental characteristics of conventional statistical principles. The distribution functions in this expanded statistical theory is a one-parameter continuous distortion of the standard Maxwell-Boltzmann models. The arguments in [56] led us to apply the HDE structure to the Kaniadakis problem from the perspective of complex quintessence and the BD theory. In [57] authors used the holographic fundamentals with Kaniadakis entropy and developed\nthe energy density of KHDE model. This energy density for Hubble horizon as infrared cutoff is given as [58]\n\u03c1d = 3c2\u03c62H2 + u2\u03c62\nH2 , (1)\nwhere H = a\u0307a is the Hubble parameter (where a denotes the scale factor and \u201c.\u201d expresses the derivative w.r.t time t), c denotes the model parameter and u is the Kaniadakis entropy parameter that is defined as \u22121 < u < 1. Furthermore, we consider the relation \u03c6 \u221d an [59]. From this relation, we can obtained the following expressions\n\u03c6\u0307 = n\u03c6H, (2) \u03c6\u0308 = H2n2\u03c6 + \u03c6nH\u0307. (3)\nFew early attempts in the literature regarding this framework [60,61] the models that came out of those efforts were interesting. The authors choose Hubble horizon rather than a future event horizon in a fundamental holographic representation was a different experiment. The goal and inspiration for this study is to assess the existing view of the cosmos using cosmological and thermodynamic methods about to with concerning the BD and the BD theory with a chameleon scalar field, utilizing the KHDE model. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the interaction between the dark sectors in the contexts of the standard BD theory and the BD theory with a chameleon scalar field Or Chameleon BD theory. In Section 3, we describe the effects of the Q1 interaction term about to with concerning the standard BD and the BD theory with a chameleon scalar field and determine a few cosmological parameters. Similarly, in Section 4, we analyze the effects of a Q2 interaction term to discuss the cosmography in the context of BD and the BD theory with a chameleon scalar field. In Section 5, we examine the thermodynamics with interaction terms Q1 and Q2 in the context of Kaniadakis entropy. In Section 6, we conclude our findings."

In the BD theory gravitational constant (G) is replaced with the BD scalar field \u03d5( G(\u03d5) = 1\u03d5 )\n. Before starting the DB action, first we consider non-flat Friedmann-RobertsonWalker (FRW) universe, which is given as\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2(t) ( dr2\n1\u2212 kr2 + r 2d\u03b82 + r2sin2\u03b8d\u03c62\n) , (4)\nwhere the curvature of the space is represented by k with k = \u22121, 0 and 1 refers to open, flat and closed universe. The action for the BD theory of gravity in the Jordan frame is defined as [30]\nS = \u222b \u221a g [ \u2212 \u03d5R + \u03c9\ng\u03b1\u03b2 \u03d5,\u03b1 \u03d5,\u03b2 \u03d5 + Lm\n] d4x, (5)\nwhere R is the Ricci scalar, \u03c9 and \u03d5 stand for the BD coupling parameter and the BD scalar field, respectively. Lm denotes the Lagrangian for matter fields, which does not depend on the scalar field. The above action can be transformed \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c6 2\n8\u03c9 , where the scalar field\n\u03d5 is redefined by a new scalar field \u03c6. In such a way, the new action in canonical form is obtained as [32]\nS = \u222b \u221a g [ \u2212 \u03c6 2\n8\u03c9 R + g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 2 + Lm\n] d4x, (6)\nthe above action is obtained by replacing non-minimal coupling term \u03c62R instead of the Einstein-Hilbert term RG (where G \u22121 = 2\u03c0\u03c6 2\n\u03c9 ) and \u03c6 is defined as the power law of a scale factor (\u03c6 \u221d an). The acceleration of the cosmos at the current time cannot be described by either the basic theory of general relativity or the BD theory without the inclusion of a cosmic constant term or another source term functioning similarly into the field equations [62,63]. Varying the action (6) (for flat FRW spacetime) with respect to (w.r.t) metric tensor by considering the universe filled with dust and KHDE, one can obtain the field equations for as follow [64]\n3\u03c62H2\n4\u03c9 + 3H\u03c6\u03c6\u0307 2\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307 2 2 = \u03c1d + \u03c1dm, (7)\n\u2212 \u03c6 2\n4\u03c9 ( 2a\u0308 a + H2 ) \u2212 H\u03c6\u03c6\u0307 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c6\u03c6\u0308 2\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307 2 2 ( 1 + 1 \u03c9 ) = Pd, (8)\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H\u03c6\u0307\u2212 3 2\u03c9 ( a\u0308 a + H2 ) \u03c6 = 0, (9)\nwhere \u03c1d and \u03c1dm are the densities of DE and dark matter (DM) while Pd expresses the pressure of DM. In this work, we consider the KHDE as the energy density of the universe. Equation (7) can also be written in form of fractional energy density by defining the critical density 3\u03c6 2 H2\n4\u03c9 .

            "text": "It has been observed [67] that most of the universe contained DM and DE. The DE is responsible for the accelerated expansion universe while DM is the hypothetical form of matter which cannot absorb, reflect or emit light. One cannot see it directly but observe its effects through gravitational attraction. Well-known observational data suggested that DE and DM occupied 68.3% and 26.8% respectively of our universe and the remaining 4.9% consists of regular matter that is seen by the human eye. The formation of a structure is effected due to the interaction between DE and DM at distinct scales and times. The cosmic coincidence problem is considered as a well-known puzzle within this perspective. This problem is elaborated that the densities of DM and DE are of the same order of magnitude, given that they evolve very differently with redshift? One can alleviate this problem through appropriate coupling between the DM and DE. This coupling is justified from a phenomenological point of view, or give a covariant prescription for it and then let the data be the judge of its viability. In this scenario, the energy conservation equations become as\n\u03c1\u0307d + 3H\u03c1d(1 + \u03c9d) = \u2212Q, (17) \u03c1\u0307dm + 3H\u03c1dm = Q, (18)\nwhere \u03c9d is the EoS parameter and Q is the interaction term. This interaction term plays a very important term as it expresses the rate of energy exchange between DE and DM. It is interesting to mention here that if Q > 0 shows the energy exchange from KHDE to DM while if Q < 0 leads to an energy transfer from DM to KHDE. If Q = 0, this corresponds to non-interaction scenario. The interaction scenario is considered a more general and comprehensive way to investigate cosmic evolution. Various linear and nonlinear interaction terms have been proposed in literature [68]. These interaction terms are the function of \u03c1d, \u03c1dm, H and their linear combinations. In this work, we discuss two types of interaction terms that are defined as follow [69\u201375]\nQ1 = 3Hb\u03c1d + \u03b3\u0302\u03c1\u0307d, (19)\nQ2 = 3Hb\u03c1dm + \u03b3\u0302\u03c1\u0307dm. (20)\nIn these interactions terms b and \u03b3\u0302 are constants and bounded between \u22121 \u2264 b \u2264 1 and \u22121 \u2264 \u03b3\u0302 \u2264 1. These kinds for the interaction terms have a minimal impact on the evolution of the universe\u2019s overall energy budget. In fact, these terms may be understood as a first order Taylor expansion. Furthermore, they are predicated on the idea that the dark particle propagator depends on energy. These interactions have been proven to be a useful method for resolving the coincidence issue [76]."

Hence, we find the Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, equation of state (EoS) parameter and jerk parameter by using the KHDE model.\n\u2022 Hubble Parameter: This parameter sets the scale of our universe at present time. The Hubble constant (H0) is called the current value of Hubble parameter which lies in the range 65\u201375 km/s/Mpc. Now, taking the derivative of Equation (7) w.r.t cosmic time and by substituting the values of \u03c6\u0307, \u03c6\u0308, \u03c1\u0307d and \u03c1\u0307dm, we obtain\nH\u0307 H2 = \u2126d(9b + 6n\u03b3 + 9 + 6n)\u2212 (9 + 6n)( 2n3 (n\u03c9\u2212 3) + 1) 6 + 12n\u2212 4\u03c9n2 \u2212 24\u03c9c2 + 2(3\u2126d \u2212 12\u03c9c2)\u2212 24\u03c9\u03b3c2 + 2\u03b3(3\u2126d \u2212 12\u03c9c2) . (21)\nNext, we convert the above expression of Hubble parameter in term of redshift parameter z. This relation is defined as\nH\u2032 = \u2212H\u0307\nH(1 + z) . (22)\nwhere H\u2032 = dHdz . Using above expression, Equation (21) become\nH\u2032 = (\u2212H)(\u2126d(9b + 6n\u03b3 + 9 + 6n)\u2212 (9 + 6n)( 2n3 (n\u03c9\u2212 3) + 1))\n(1 + z)(6 + 12n\u2212 4\u03c9n2 \u2212 24\u03c9c2 + 2(3\u2126d \u2212 12\u03c9c2)\u2212 24\u03c9\u03b3c2 + 2\u03b3(3\u2126d \u2212 12\u03c9c2)) .

This plot is showing that the current value of Hubble parameter H0 = 74 which is compatible with observational bounds [77]. Additionally, the range of this parameter lies in H = 107.5\u00b1 92.5.\n\u2022 Deceleration Parameter: This important parameter is denoted by q. It differentiates the decelerated as well as the accelerated phase of the universe.

(26)\nIn Figure 2, the deceleration parameter q is plotted against redshift z for the three different values of c. It has been noted that the universe is showing the early decelerated phase to current accelerated phase. For z > \u22120.6, the trajectories show the decelerated phase while z < \u22120.6 these trajectories indicate the accelerated expansion of the universe [77].\n\u2022 Jerk Parameter: This parameter provides a convenient and alternative way to describe cosmological methods close to concordance \u039bCDM model. If j = 1 (constant) it corresponds to \u039bCDM model. Mathematically, this parameter is defined as the third derivative of a scale factor w.r.t time t as [78\u201380]\nj = d3a dt3\naH3 = q(2q + 1) + dq dz (1 + z).

These properties are driven by the study of black hole physics and discovered a strong relationship between gravity and thermodynamics [81\u201383]. According to thermodynamics, the rate of change in entropy and heat capacity must be positive for an accelerated expansion of the universe. Thus, thermodynamical axioms have become the key factor to check the stability of the model. The thermodynamic and fluid-dynamic features of gravity provide us with other perspectives to comprehend gravity in the absence of a quantum theory. Thermodynamics is a physical science that is concerned with the concepts of energy, heat and temperature as well as how they relate to radiation, energy, and the physical properties of matter. When we consider observable macroscopic physical quantities like volume, pressure, internal energy, temperature and entropy, the four thermodynamic properties provide a significant explanation for the behavior of these values. In these properties, the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) is very important. This law is defined as the total entropy of an isolated system must be non-negative (S\u0307tot) = S\u0307u + S\u0307int \u2265 0 (where S\u0307int, S\u0307u are the rate of change of the internal and external entropies of the system). To check the validity of GSLT, first we start with the Gibbs equation [84], in which the entropy of the universe inside the horizon is represented by its energy and pressure as\nTdSint = dE + pdV, (46)\nthat can be rewritten in following expression\nS\u0307int = 1 T (E\u0307 + pV\u0307), (47)\nhere V represents the volume which defined as V = 4\u03c0R 3 A\n3 (for flat FRW universe RA = 1 H ),\nE is the total energy of the system that is E = \u03c1V and T is the fluid\u2019s temperature which bounded by the horizon. To avoid non-equilibrium thermodynamic\u2019s mathematical complexity in that case. We also assume that there is no sudden energy exchange between the fluid and the horizon. Therefore, it assumed that the cosmological fluid T within a horizon is at the same degree as the bounded horizon Th that is T = Th. Now, we take derivatives of V, E w.r.t time and then put these in Equation (47), we obtain\nS\u0307int = 8\u03c02\nH4\n[ \u03c1\u0307\n3 \u2212 (\u03c1 + p) H\u0307 H\n] . (48)\nFor external scenarios, the combination of Kaniadakis and Bekenstein Hawking entropies is given as [54,55]\nSu = SBH + u2\n6 S3BH . (49)\nBy taking derivative of Equation (49) w.r.t time we get\nS\u0307u = \u2212 2\u03c0H\u0307 GH3 \u2212 u 2H\u0307 G3H7 , (50)\nwhere SBH = A4G and A = 4\u03c0R 2 A. Using Equation (48) and (50), the total entropy of the system become\nS\u0307tot = 8\u03c02\nH4\n[ \u03c1\u0307\n3 \u2212 (\u03c1 + p) H\u0307 H\n] \u2212 (\n2\u03c0 GH2 + u2 G3H6 ) H\u0307 H . (51)"

            "text": "Yang et al. [85] studied the correspondence between the tachyon, quintessence, dilaton scalar field, K-essence, and Chaplygin gas model with the non-interacting new HDE model in the non-flat BD theory. They reconstructed the potentials and dynamics for these models and found the accelerated expansion of the universe in the context of the BD theory. In Ref. [66], the authors reconstructed a new HDE model with \u03c6 = \u03c60a\u03b1 V = V0\u03c6\u03b2 and f = f0\u03c6\u03b3. They considered the chameleon BD cosmology and worked on the correspondence between the quintessence, the DBI-essence, and the tachyon scalar field models with the non-interacting new HDE model. They also found the expression of the Hubble parameter and stability for the obtained solutions of the crossing of the phantom divide. They found that the potential increases as the matter-chameleon coupling gets stronger with the evolution of the universe. The basic purpose of this paper was to explore the effects of interaction terms on the cosmology of KHDE in the context of BD and the BD theory with a chameleon scalar field\nfor the flat FRW universe. We have investigated the cosmographical parameters, such as Hubble parameter H, the deceleration parameter q, the EoS parameter \u03c9d, and the jerk parameter j in the framework of BD and the BD theory with a chameleon scalar field for the flat FRW universe. We also discussed the GSLT of KHDE for the standard BD and the BD theory with a chameleon scalar field. We take the values of constant parameters for both interaction terms in standard BD theory as u = \u22120.9, \u03b3 = \u22120.8, n = 0.0009. The values of constants in the BD theory with a chameleon scalar field for Q1 term are taken as u = 0.01, \u03b3 = 0.002, n = 0.0009, and for the Q2 term as u = \u22120.09, \u03b3 = \u22120.7, andn = 0.09. Throughout the paper, the Brans\u2013Dicke coupling constant is assumed to be \u03c9 = 40,000 [86]. We observed the effects of interaction term Q1 in the context of the standard BD theory on the Hubble parameter H, which have shown the positive behavior that represents the universe expanded, that q has gone from a decelerated phase to an accelerated phase shown and that the expansion of the universe is accelerated, the jerk parameter j has shown positive behavior, and EoS \u03c9d is in the quintessence era. It has been found that the effects of interaction term Q1 in the context of BD theory with a chameleon scalar field on the Hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter gave us an accelerated expansion (see Figures 5 and 6). Meanwhile, the jerk parameter j has shown positive behavior for all the trajectories, and \u03c9d indicated the quintessence era. We examined the effects of the Q2 interaction term in the framework of standard BD theory. It has been found that the Hubble parameter H and the deceleration parameter q show the accelerated expansion of the universe. The jerk parameter indicated positive behavior and converged to \u22121 when z \u2212\u2192 \u22121, and the EoS parameter varies from quintessence to the phantom region and approaches to \u22121. It has been observed that the effects of interaction term Q2 are in the context of BD theory with a chameleon scalar field. Here, we observed that the Hubble parameter H, as well as the deceleration parameter q, shows the accelerated expansion of the universe. For this interaction term, the trajectories of the jerk parameter and EoS parameter provide us the universe\u2019s quintessence phase. We also contrasted our results with observational data related to the EoS parameter. We observed that the EoS parameter results are compatible with those from the Planck collaboration [77]. The following are the observational data:\n\u03c9d Observational Schemes\n\u22121.56+0.60\u22120.48 Planck+TT+lowE \u22121.58+0.52\u22120.41 Planck+TT, TE, EE+lowE \u22121.57+0.50\u22120.40 Planck+TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing \u22121.40+0.10\u22120.10 Planck+TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing+BAO\nWe also examined the results of deceleration parameter q with observational data [87], which demonstrates its compatible behavior.
