    "abstractText": "Extremely large-scale array (XL-array) is envisioned to achieve super-high spectral efficiency in future wireless networks. Different from the existing works that mostly focus on the nearfield communications, we consider in this paper a new and practical scenario, called mixed nearand far-field communications, where there exist both nearand far-field users in the network. For this scenario, we first obtain a closed-form expression for the inter-user interference at the near-field user caused by the far-field beam by using Fresnel functions, based on which the effects of the number of BS antennas, far-field user (FU) angle, near-field user (NU) angle and distance are analyzed. We show that the strong interference exists when the number of the BS antennas and the NU distance are relatively small, and/or the NU and FU angle-difference is small. Then, we further obtain the achievable rate of the NU as well as its rate loss caused by the FU interference. Last, numerical results are provided to corroborate our analytical results.",

INTRODUCTION\nExtremely large-scale array/surface (XL-array/surface) has emerged as a promising technology to achieve the ever-increasing performance requirements of future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, such as super-high spectral efficiency and spatial resolution [1], [2]. This fundamentally leads to the communication paradigm shift from the conventional far-field communications (with planar-wave propagation) to the near-field communications (with spherical-wave propagation) [3] and even the new mixed near- and far-field communications (with both planar/spherical-wave propagation). For example, consider an XL-array communication system where a base station (BS) equipped with an antenna of diameter 0.5 meter (m) communicates with users at 30 GHz frequency. In this case, the well-known Rayleigh distance is about 50 m [4]. As such, for a typical communication scenario, it may happen that some users reside in the nearfield region, while the others locate in the far-field region, thus leading to several new design issues such as mixed-field channel estimation, joint near-/far-field beamforming, etc.\nIn particular, consider the inter-user interference in different communication scenarios. First, if the users considered are all in the far-field region, spatial division multiple access (SDMA) [5] or beam division multiple access (BDMA) [6] can be employed to simultaneously serve multiple users with low inter-user interference. This is because different far-field directional beams pointing towards different users are asymptotically orthogonal in\nY. Zhang and C.

Zheng is with the School of Microelectronics, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 511442, China (e-mail: bxzheng@scut.edu.cn).\nthe angular domain, thus eliminating the inter-user interference. Next, if the users locate in the near-field region, it has been recently shown in [5], [7] that the near-field users locating at different angles and/or (BS-user) distances can be served simultaneously by using the near-field beams with reduced interuser interference. This is achieved by exploiting the unique nearfield beam focusing effect that enables the beam to be focused at a specific location rather than a specific direction in conventional far-field communications.\nNevertheless, for the new mixed-field communication scenario, the inter-user interference analysis becomes more complicated. Specifically, the interference at the near-field user (NU) caused by the far-field user (FU) is fundamentally determined by the correlation between the NU channel steering vector and the FU beam. To examine it, we show in Fig. 1 the interference power at a NU caused by the FU beam. An interesting observation is that the NU suffers strong interference from the FU beam, even when it locates at a spatial angle different from that of the FU (see the shadow area), which significantly differs from the results in the scenarios with NUs or FUs only. This new phenomenon, however, has not been studied in the existing literature, which thus motivates the current work.\nIn this paper, we consider an XL-array communication system with one NU and one FU. First, we characterize the normalized interference power at the NU caused by the FU beam in closed form by using Fresnel functions,1 based on which the effects of the number of BS antennas, FU angle, NU angle and distance are analyzed. It is shown that there is strong interference when the the number of BS antennas and the NU distance are relatively small, and/or the FU and NU angles are very close. Then, the resulting rate loss due to inter-user interference is obtained, and numerical results are provided to verify our theoretical results.\n1The obtained results can be readily extended to analyze the interference at the FU caused by the NU beam.\nar X\niv :2\n30 1.\n07 27\n7v 2\n[ ee\nss .S\nP] 2\n9 Ja\nn 20\n23\n2 Near-field user\n\ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udf19\n\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc66\nBS\n\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc5b)\n0, \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc5f 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf032, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03\n\ud835\udf03 = cos\ud835\udf19\n0,0 Far-field user\ud835\udf13 = cos \ud835\udf11\ud835\udf11Baseband Processing\nRF chain\nRF chain\nPhase shifters\n\ud835\udc41RF\nFig. 2: A two-user XL-array wireless communication system."

(11)\nMoreover, C\u0302(\u03b21, \u03b22) , C(\u03b21+\u03b22)\u2212C(\u03b21\u2212\u03b22) and S\u0302(\u03b21, \u03b22) , S(\u03b21 + \u03b22) \u2212 S(\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22), where C(\u00b7) and S(\u00b7) are the Fresnel integrals, defined as C(x) = \u222b x 0 cos(\u03c02 t 2)dt and S(x) =\u222b x\n0 sin(\u03c02 t 2)dt.\nProof: First, from (8), we have\nf(N,\u03c8, \u03b8, r) = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1N N\u22121\u2211 n=0 ej\u03c0(A1n\u2212A2) 2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = |F (A1, A2)| , where A1 = \u221a d(1\u2212\u03b82)\n2r and A2 = 1 A1 ( \u03b8\u2212\u03c8 2 + (N\u22121)d(1\u2212\u03b82) 4r ) .\nThen, the summation in F (A1, A2) can be approximated as an integral,\nF (A1, A2) (b1)\u2248 1\nN \u222b N 0 ej\u03c0(A1n\u2212A2) 2 dn\n(b2) =\n1\nN \u221a\n2A1 \u222b \u221a2A1N\u2212\u221a2A2 \u2212 \u221a 2A2 ej\u03c0 1 2 t 2 dt, (12)\nwhere (b1) is accurate when N \u2192\u221e according to the Riemann integral, and (b2) is obtained by letting A1n\u2212A2 = \u221a 2 2 t.\nNext, based on the Fresnel integrals, we have\nF (A1, A2) = 1\nN \u221a\n2A1 \u222b \u221a2A1N\u2212\u221a2A2 \u2212 \u221a 2A2 ej\u03c0 1 2 t 2 dt\n=\n\u222b\u221a2A1N\u2212\u221a2A2 0 ej\u03c0 1 2 t 2 dt\u2212 \u222b \u2212\u221a2A2 0 ej\u03c0 1 2 t 2\ndt \u221a\n2A1N\n500 1000 1500 2000 Number of BS antennas, N\n-15\n-10\n-5\nN o\nrm al\niz ed\ni n\nte rf\ner en\nce p\no w\ner (\nd B\n)\n=0.05, =0, r=3, approx.

To draw useful insights, we first illustrate in Fig. 3 that function G(\u03b21, \u03b22) versus \u03b21 and \u03b22 in both 2D and 3D. Several important properties of the function G(\u00b7) are summarized as follows. \u2022 First, G(\u00b7) is symmetric with respect to \u03b21. With \u03b21 defined\nin (10), this symmetry indicates that the normalized interference power keeps unchanged when the absolute values of the near-and-far user angle-difference \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8 are the same. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that G(\u00b7) is almost invariable with \u03b21 when \u03b22 is sufficiently small. \u2022 Second, given \u03b21, G(\u00b7) generally decreases with \u03b22, while there exist large and small fluctuations in G(\u00b7) with growing \u03b22, when |\u03b21| is relatively large (e.g., |\u03b21| > 0.6) and small (e.g., |\u03b21| \u2264 0.6). \u2022 Moreover, it is worth noting that the derived closed-form expression for G(\u00b7) in (9) is a generalization of the column coherence between two near-field steering vectors defined in [12] by setting \u03b21 = 0, i.e., both near- and far-field steering vectors are at the same angle (\u03b8 = \u03c8).\nRemark 2 (What determines the normalized interference power?). Theorem 1 shows an important result that the normalized interference power is fundamentally determined by the function G(\u00b7), as well as the two parameters \u03b21 and \u03b22. To be more specific, \u03b21 is a function of the FU (spatial) angle, the NU angle and distance, while \u03b22 is jointly determined by the number of BS antennas, as well as the NU angle and distance. These factors will be studied in more details in the next."

It is observed that the approximation in (9) is accurate under different numbers of BS antennas and NU distances. Next, given the fixed FU angle, NU angle and distance, \u03b22 is affected by the number of BS antennas N only, while \u03b21 becomes a constant. Moreover, the BS antenna size affects the near-field region, since the Rayleigh distance, Z = 12N\n2\u03bb, is quadratically increasing with the number of BS antennas.

First, it is observed that the normalized interference power is first increasing and then decreasing with N . The reason is that, when N is small, increasing N leads to a wider interference region in the angular domain (see Fig. 1); hence, increasing N renders the NU more likely reside in the interference region and thus growing interference power. Nevertheless, when N is sufficiently large, the NU (in the interference region) suffers decreasing interference power with an increasing N due to the wider interference region. Second, when N is relatively small (i.e., \u03b22 is small), a larger angle-difference (i.e., larger \u03b21) leads to a smaller interference, which is consistent with the second property in Remark 1. By contrast, in the large-N regime (e.g., N > 400), the interference powers for different angle differences are comparable. This is expected since the interference region becomes wider with a larger N and will occupy almost the whole spatial region when N is sufficiently large, for which different angle-differences will suffer comparable interference power.\n2) Effect of the FU Angle: Next, given the fixed number of BS antennas, the NU angle and distance, we characterize the effect of FU angle. In this case, \u03b21 is determined by the FU angle \u03c8, while \u03b22 is a constant. To be more specific, we plot in Fig. 5(a) the normalized interference power versus the FU angle. An interesting observation is that when the FU beam angle locates in the neighborhood of the NU angle, there is always strong interference power at the NU. Moreover, the interference power is symmetric with respect to the NU angle, which is in accordance with the first property in Remark 1.\nGiven the NU angle, the FU angle also determines the nearand-far user angle-difference, whose effects are discussed below.\nRemark 3 (Near-and-far user angle-difference). In Fig. 5(b), we show the effect of the angle-difference on the normalized interference power. First, it is observed that, when the angledifference is sufficiently small, e.g., \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8 < 0.01, a longer NU distance (e.g., r = 30 m) yields a higher interference power. This is intuitively expected since when the NU and FU are very close, the interference power will increase with the NU distance, and the maximum interference power is obtained when the NU distance exceeds the Rayleigh distance (i.e., far-field region). Second, as the angle-difference increases, the interference power for different angle-differences generally decreases, and eventually appears very close when the angle-difference exceeds a threshold (e.g., \u03b8\u2212\u03c8 > 0.35). Besides, the interference power with a longer NU distance decreases faster. This reason is that a longer NU distance leads to a narrower interference region.\n3) Effect of the NU Angle: Note that both \u03b21 and \u03b22 are functions of NU angle \u03b8 with the fixed number of BS antennas, FU angle, and NU distance, thus making it difficult to obtain clear insights with respect to the effect of the NU angle. To this end, we plot in Fig. 5(c) the normalized interference power versus the NU angle \u03b8. It is observed that the effect of NU angle is very similar to that of the FU angle, whereas in the large-\u03b8 regime, the interference power fluctuates more drastically.\n4) Effect of the NU Distance: Last, we study the effect of the NU distance r on the normalized interference power, given the fixed number of BS antennas, NU and FU angles. Based on Theorem 1, it can be easily verified that \u03b21 monotonically increases with r, while \u03b22 decreases with r. Although it is difficult to analytically characterize the effect of NU distance, we provide the numerical result in Fig. 5(d) for illustration. Specifically, similar to Fig. 4(b), for the case with a small angledifference (e.g., \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8 = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2), the normalized interference power first slightly increases and then drastically decreases with the NU distance. In contrast, when the angledifference is sufficiently small (e.g., \u03b8\u2212\u03c8 = 0.005), the normalized interference power first increases and then saturates when r is sufficiently large, which is in accordance with Remark 3. Moreover, it is observed that, with a very small angle-difference (e.g., \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8 = 0.005), the NU suffers the strongest interference power when it is sufficiently far from the BS, for which case it reduces to a FU."

Lemma 1 is intuitively expected since a higher normalized interference power leads to a larger rate loss \u2206R. Combined with the results for the analysis of the interference power, it can be concluded that there is a larger rate loss when the NU and FU angles are very close. However, the analysis for the effects of number of BS antennas and NU distance are not straightforward. For example, when N decreases, it can be shown that gnear monotonically decreases, while f2 generally increases, leading to a larger Pfarf 2\nPfarf2+Pnear . Thus, we further provide numerical results\nin the next to examine these effects."

To begin with, we plot in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) the results based on the used Fresnel approximation in (9) and its actual value in (8) versus N and \u03c8. It is observed that the used approximation is highly accurate with the actual value under different N and \u03c8. Second, it is observed from Fig. 6(a) that the rate loss is monotonically decreasing with N , which agrees with the result in Lemma 1. An interesting observation is that there still exists a large rate loss when the number of antennas becomes very large (i.e., very low interference power). This is because, with an increasing N , the interference power generally decreases, while the beamforming gain (i.e., gnear in (14)) increases, thus leading to the performance gap between the achievable and ideal rates of NU. On the other hand, the rate loss fluctuates when the FU angle is in the neighborhood of the NU angle, and drastically decreases when the angle is larger than a threshold (see Figs. 6(b) and 6(c)). Next, in Fig. 6(d), we observe that the rate loss first slightly fluctuates when r is small, and sharply decreases when r increases.
