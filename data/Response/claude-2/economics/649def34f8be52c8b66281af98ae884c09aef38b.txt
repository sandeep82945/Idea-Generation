 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Develop better models for author name disambiguation to create accurate author profiles and collaboration networks. This could involve using graph-based methods or incorporating additional context beyond just name and affiliation. 

2. Expand the coverage of entities and relations extracted from text using distant supervision and neural models. This could help populate knowledge graphs with new concepts and relationships not yet present in existing knowledge bases.

3. Build systems to automatically generate high-quality figure captions and extract tables from scientific documents. Figures and tables contain important information but are difficult to interpret without descriptive captions.

4. Create models to classify citations as important vs incidental and predict future citation rates for papers and authors. This could help understand the impact and potential of research more accurately.

5. Develop an end-to-end system to recommend relevant papers to cite in a given manuscript draft. This could improve the quality of academic writing and literature reviews by ensuring important prior work is not overlooked.
