1. **Investigate the role of the periosteum in bone regeneration in different animal models:** 
The majority of the research on the periosteum's role in bone regeneration has been conducted in rodents. It is important to investigate whether the findings from these studies can be translated to other animal models, such as rabbits, dogs, and pigs, which are more commonly used in preclinical studies of bone regeneration therapies.


2. **Explore the use of periosteum-derived stem cells for the treatment of bone diseases:** 
Periosteum-derived stem cells have been shown to have the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. This suggests that these cells could be used to treat a variety of bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and bone cancer.


3. **Develop new methods for the isolation and expansion of periosteum-derived stem cells:** 
The current methods for isolating and expanding periosteum-derived stem cells are time-consuming and inefficient. There is a need to develop new methods that are more efficient and scalable, in order to make these cells more accessible for clinical use.


4. **Investigate the use of hydrogels as scaffolds for periosteum engineering:** 
Hydrogels are promising materials for periosteum engineering because they are biocompatible, biodegradable, and can be easily modified to incorporate bioactive molecules. However, more research is needed to optimize the composition and properties of hydrogels for this application.


5. **Develop new strategies for the vascularization of engineered periostea:** 
One of the major challenges in periosteum engineering is the vascularization of the constructs. Without a blood supply, the cells in the engineered periosteum will not be able to survive and function properly. There is a need to develop new strategies for vascularizing engineered periostea, such as the use of bioprinting techniques to create perfusable channels within the constructs.
