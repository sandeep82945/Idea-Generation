Although the resource typically depends on the particular task, in the context of multipartite systems entangled quantum states are often regarded as resourceful. We propose an algorithmic method to find maximally resourceful states of several particles for various applications and quantifiers. We discuss in detail the case of the geometric measure, identifying physically interesting states and also deliver insights to the problem of absolutely maximally entangled states. Moreover, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by applying it to maximally entangled subspaces, the Schmidt-rank, the stabilizer rank as well as the preparability in triangle networks.\nIntroduction.\u2014 The access to multipartite quantum states is an indispensable prerequisite for many applications in quantum information, turning them into a powerful resource which potentially outperform their classical counterparts [1\u20133]. Indeed, magic states turn out to be a resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation [4, 5] while cluster states are resourceful for measurementbased quantum computation [6, 7]. Furthermore, the power of quantum metrology heavily relies on the ability to prepare multipartite quantum states. However, for a particular given task it is in general very challenging to identify those multipartite states which yield the largest advantage.\nFor many important applications entanglement has been proven to be a powerful resource. An example of resourceful states are the absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states which maximized the entanglement in the bipartitions, but are notoriously difficult to characterize [8\u201314]. Still, the analysis of AME states is important for understanding quantum error correction and regarded as one of the central problems in the field [15, 16]. However, multiparticle entanglement offers a complex and rich structure resulting in the impossibility of quantification by means of a single number. Consequently, there is a variety of quantifiers, each emphasizing a different property that makes a state a valuable resource [17\u201319].\nThe geometric measure of entanglement [20\u201323] quantifies the proximity of a quantum state to the set of product states, has an intuitive meaning and also offers multiple operational interpretations. For instance, it relates to multipartite state discrimination using LOCC [24], the additivity of channel capacities [25], quantum state estimation [26] and was also used to describe quantum phase transitions [27\u201330].\nIn complexity theory, identifying maximally entangled states and computing their geometric measure allows for the identification of cases where the MAX-N -local Hamiltonian problem and its product state approximation deviate maximally [31, 32]. So, although high geometric entanglement does not guarantee that a quantum state\nis useful for all tasks [33\u201335], finding maximally entangled states has been recognised as a natural and important problem [32]. So far, however, maximally entangled states have only been identified within the lowdimensional family of symmetric qubit states, where their computation is related to the problem of distributing charges on the unit sphere [19, 36, 37], or within the family of graph states that stem from bipartite graphs [38].\nMathematically, the complexity of the task reflects the fact that pure multiparticle states are described by tensors. In contrast to the matrix case, notions like ranks and eigenvalues are for tensors much less understood\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n13 47\n5v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 1\nJu n\n20 23\n2 and their computation turns out to be a hard problem [39, 40]. Interestingly, the geometric measure is closely related to the recently introduced concept of tensor eigenvalues [22, 41\u201344], offering a much more complex structure as the matrix case [45] as well as to the notion of injective tensor norms [46, 47] and matrix permanents [48]. Here, maximally entangled states offer maximal tensor eigenvalues [49] and it was conjectured that the overlap of a multipartite qubit state with the set of product states decreases exponentially in the number of particles [47]. So, the identification of maximally entangled states provides valuable intuition to decide this conjecture.\nIn this paper we design an iterative method for finding maximally resourceful multipartite quantum states. Choosing initially a generic quantum state, we show that in each step of the algorithm the resourcefulness increases. We illustrate the universality of our method by applying it to various different resource quantifiers and present a detailed analysis for the geometric measure. Here we identify for moderate sizes the corresponding states, revealing an interesting connection to AME states. Further, we introduce a novel quantifier for maximally entangled subspaces for which we provide a full characterization for the case of three qubits.\nThe geometric measure.\u2014 This measure quantifies how well a given multiparticle quantum state can be approximated by pure product states. More formally [20\u201323], given |\u03c6\u27e9 one defines G(|\u03c6\u27e9) = 1\u2212 \u03bb2(|\u03c6\u27e9) with\n\u03bb2(|\u03c6\u27e9) = max |\u03c0\u27e9 |\u27e8\u03c0|\u03c6\u27e9|2, (1)\nwhere the maximization runs over all product states |\u03c0\u27e9 of the corresponding system. This quantity for pure states can be extended to mixed states via the convex roof construction and is then a proper entanglement monotone [22].\nWhile computing \u03bb2 for a generic pure state is, in principle, difficult [50], there is a simple see-saw iteration that can be used [51\u201353]. For a three-partite state |\u03c6\u27e9, the algorithm starts with a random product state |a0b0c0\u27e9. From this we can compute the nonnormalized state |a\u0303\u27e9 = \u27e8b0c0|\u03c6\u27e9, and make the update |a0\u27e9 7\u2192 |a1\u27e9 = |a\u0303\u27e9/ \u221a \u27e8a\u0303|a\u0303\u27e9. The procedure is repeated for the second qubit |b0\u27e9, starting in the product state |a1b0c0\u27e9. This is then iterated until one reaches a fixed point. Of course, this fixed point is not guaranteed to be the global optimum, in practice, however, this method works very well.\nIdea of the algorithm.\u2014 We present the algorithm for the case of three qubits. The generalization to arbitrary multiparticle systems is straightforward and is discussed in Appendix A [54]. As initial state |\u03c6\u27e9 we choose a random pure three qubit state. Then, we compute its closest product state |\u03c0\u27e9 via the see-saw algorithm described above. We can assume without loss of generality\nthat |\u03c0\u27e9 = |000\u27e9. We write \u03bb = |\u27e8\u03c6|\u03c0\u27e9| for the maximal overlap of |\u03c6\u27e9 with the set of all product states. Note that for a generic quantum state the closest product state is unique. The key idea is now to perturb the state |\u03c6\u27e9 in a way that the overlap with |\u03c0\u27e9 decreases. If |\u03c0\u27e9 is the unique closest product state and the perturbation is small, one can then expect that the overlap with all product states decreases. So, we consider the orthocomplement of |\u03c0\u27e9 = |000\u27e9, that is, the complex subspace spanned by |001\u27e9, |010\u27e9, |100\u27e9, |011\u27e9, |101\u27e9, |110\u27e9, |111\u27e9. This subspace gives rise to a projection operator \u03a0 = 1 \u2212|\u03c0\u27e9\u27e8\u03c0| and we compute the best approximation of the state |\u03c6\u27e9 within this subspace, given by |\u03b7\u27e9 = \u03a0|\u03c6\u27e9/M, where M denotes the normalization. Then, we shift the state |\u03c6\u27e9 in the direction of |\u03b7\u27e9 by some small amount \u03b8 > 0. Hence the state update rule is given by\n|\u03c6\u27e9 7\u2192 |\u03c6\u0303\u27e9 := 1 N (|\u03c6\u27e9+ \u03b8|\u03b7\u27e9) (2)\nwhere N is a normalization factor. In the next step, we calculate the best rank one approximation to |\u03c6\u0303\u27e9. This process is iterated until the geometric measure is not increasing under the update rule (2). In this case, one can reduce the step size or the algorithm terminates. One can directly check that the overlap with |\u03c0\u27e9 is smaller for |\u03c6\u0303\u27e9 than for |\u03c6\u27e9. Indeed one has\n|\u27e8\u03c0|\u03c6\u0303\u27e9|2 = 1 N 2 |\u27e8\u03c0|\u03c6\u27e9+ \u03b8\u27e8\u03c0|\u03b7\u27e9|2 = \u03bb 2 N 2 < \u03bb2 (3)\nsince N > 1 if \u03b8 > 0. In fact, a much stronger statement holds:\nObservation 1. For a generic quantum state |\u03c8\u27e9 there always exists a \u0398 > 0 such that the updated state |\u03c8\u0303\u27e9 according to Eq. (2) with step size \u03b8 < \u0398 fulfills G(|\u03c8\u27e9) < G(|\u03c8\u0303\u27e9). Observation 1 provides the guarantee that the pro-\nposed algorithm yields a sequence of states with increasing geometric measure. The proof is given in Appendix A [54] and comes with an interesting feature. It turns out that the proof does not rely on the particular product state structure of |\u03c0\u27e9, so any figure of merit based on maximizing the overlap with pure states from some subset can be optimized with our method. This turns the algorithm into a powerful and tool with a universal applicability. Indeed, we adapt it to the dimensionality of entanglement [54, Appendix D], the stabilizer rank [54, Appendix E], matrix product states [54, Appendix F] as well as to the preparability in quantum networks [54, Appendix G]. Remarkably, here novel states are found which are more distant to any network state as those known so far. Implementation.\u2014 Thanks to the update rule in\nEq. (2), we can make use of advanced descent optimization algorithms in order to obtain faster convergence and\n3 higher robustness against local optima [55, 56]. We have implemented a descent algorithm with momentum as well as the Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) [57]. The idea behind the momentum version is to keep track of the direction of the updates. More precisely, the update direction |\u03b7n\u27e9 in the n-th iteration will be a running average of the previously encountered updates |\u03b71\u27e9, ..., |\u03b7n\u22121\u27e9. For the NAG method, the update vector is, contrary to Eq. (2), evaluated at a point estimated from previous\naccumulated updates, and not at |\u03c6\u27e9. A more detailed discussion and a comparison of the different methods can be found in Appendix B [54]. The convergence of the algorithm in the case of qubits is also shown in Fig. 1.\nAfter the algorithm has terminated, one obtains a tensor presented in a random basis. In order to identify the state and to obtain a concise form, we have to find appropriate local basis for each party, such that the state becomes as simple as possible. This can be done by a suitable local unitary transformation, see Appendix C for details [54].\nResults for qubits.\u2014 For two qubits, the maximally entangled state is the Bell state and our algorithm directly converges to this maximum. For the case of three qubits there are two different equivalence classes of genuine tripartite entangled states with respect to stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) [58], namely |W\u27e9 = (|001\u27e9 + |010\u27e9 + |100\u27e9)/ \u221a 3 and |GHZ\u27e9 = (|000\u27e9 + |111\u27e9)/ \u221a 2. While G(|GHZ\u27e9) = 1/2 one has G(|W\u27e9) = 5/9, what turns out to be the maximizer among all tripartite states [59]. Indeed, after 150 iterations, the algorithm yields the W state. It should be noted, that in this case the maximizer belongs to the family of symmetric states. Operationally, the W state is the state with the maximal possible bipartite entanglement in the reduced two-qubit states [58].\nFor four qubits, the algorithm yields after 300 iterations the state\n|M\u0303\u27e9 = 1\u221a 3 (|GHZ\u27e9+ e2\u03c0i/3|GHZ34\u27e9+ e4\u03c0i/3|GHZ24\u27e9)\n(4)\nwhere |GHZij\u27e9 means a four-qubit GHZ state where a bit flip is applied at party i and j. Note that the phases form a trine in the complex plane and that the state is a phased Dicke state [60]. This state can be shown to be LU-equivalent to the so called Higuchi-Sudbery or M state [11, 61], which appears as maximizer of the Tsallis \u03b1-entropy in the reduced two-particle states for 0 < \u03b1 < 2. Note that this state is not symmetric with respect to permutations of the parties. Similar to the W state, the entanglement of the state in Eq. (4) appears to be robust, that is, uncontrolled decoherence of one qubit does not completely destroy the entanglement of the remaining qubits [61].\nFor five qubits the algorithm converges to a state |G5\u27e9, that can be identified with the ring cluster state\nn Gsymmmax Gmax |\u03c6\u27e9max 2 1/2 1/2 |\u03c8\u2212\u27e9 3 0.5555 \u2248 5/9 0.5555 \u2248 5/9 |W\u27e9 4 0.6666 \u2248 2/3 0.7777 \u2248 7/9 |M\u27e9 5 \u2248 0.7006 0.8686 \u2248 (1/36)(33 \u2212 \u221a 3) |G5\u27e9 6 0.7777 \u2248 7/9 0.9166 \u2248 11/12 |G6\u27e9 7 \u2248 0.7967 \u2265 0.941 MMS(7, 2)\n4 other choices. In fact, it has been shown that those states can be even SLOCC inequivalent [65, 66]. It is in general a difficult problem to decide whether two states belong to the same SLOCC class, but for the case of AME states it can be drastically simplified using our algorithm in combination with the Kempf-Ness theorem [67]. First, notice that states with maximally mixed 1-body marginals belong to the so-called class of critical states [68]. The theorem then assures that two critical states belong to the same SLOCC class if and only if they are LU equivalent. Hence, if the geometric measure of those states differs, it already implies SLOCC inequivalence.\nSystems of higher dimensions.\u2014 For the bipartite case the generalized Bell states |\u03d5d\u27e9 = \u2211d\u22121 j=0 |jj\u27e9/ \u221a d are maximally entangled with G(|\u03d5d\u27e9) = 1\u22121/d. We find that for 2 \u2264 d \u2264 10 the algorithm yields the corresponding state |\u03c8d\u27e9 with high fidelity, and that the number of iterations needed until convergence appears to be independent of d, see also Appendix B [54].\nIn the three-qutrit case we obtain the total antisymmetric state |\u03a83\u27e9, given by\n|\u03a83\u27e9 = 1\u221a 6 (|012\u27e9+ |201\u27e9+ |120\u27e9 \u2212 |210\u27e9 \u2212 |102\u27e9 \u2212 |021\u27e9)\n(5)\nIn general, antisymmetric states |\u03a8n\u27e9 can be constructed for all n-partite n-level systems and their geometric measure can be easily computed analytically as n!\u22121n! [69]. In the particular case n = 3 we obtain G = 56 \u2248 0.8333. Note that |\u03a83\u27e9 is an AME state.\nMore generally, in the tripartite case a procedure is known to construct AME states for arbitrary d [70]. This leads to\nAME(3, d) \u223c d\u22121\u2211 i,j=0 |i\u27e9|j\u27e9|i+ j\u27e9, (6)\nwhere i + j is computed modulo d. Note that the state AME(3, 3) constructed according to Eq. (6) only has a measure of 2/3.\nFor the case of three ququads our algorithm gives insights into the AME problem. First, the AME(3, 4) state corresponding to Eq. (6) has a geometric measure of G = 0.75. However, our algorithm yields a state given by\n|\u03d53,4\u27e9 = 1\n2 \u221a 2 (|022\u27e9+ |033\u27e9+ |120\u27e9+ |131\u27e9\n+|212\u27e9+ |203\u27e9+ |310\u27e9+ |301\u27e9) (7)\nwith G(|\u03d53,4\u27e9) = 7/8 = 0.875. After applying local unitaries, this state can be seen as arising from three Bell pairs distributed between three parties in a triangle like configuration. In addition, |\u03d53,4\u27e9 is an AME state, i.e., all one-party marginals are maximally mixed. As the geometric measure of the states |\u03d53,4\u27e9 and AME(3, 4) differs, they belong to different SLOCC classes.\nIn the case of four qutrits the algorithm converges to a state with a geometric measure of 0.888 \u2248 89 . This state can be identified to be the AME(4, 3) state given by [70]\nAME(4, 3) = 1\n3 (|0000\u27e9+ |0112\u27e9+ |0221\u27e9+ |1011\u27e9+ |1120\u27e9 + |1202\u27e9+ |2022\u27e9+ |2101\u27e9+ |2210\u27e9) (8)\nFor four ququads, the algorithm converges to the antisymmetric state |\u03a84\u27e9, yielding a measure of 2324 \u2248 0.9583. Interestingly, while being 1-uniform, this state is not AME. The so far only known AME(4, 4), a graph state [66, 71], yields a measure of 1516 = 0.9375. Finally, the recently found AME(4, 6) [16] is not maximally entangled with respect to the geometric measure, i.e., the algorithm finds states yielding a higher geometric measure. Similarly, there exists a general procedure to construct\nAME(5, d) states given by [70, 72]\nAME(5, d) \u223c d\u22121\u2211 i,j,l=0 \u03c9il|i\u27e9|j\u27e9|i+ j\u27e9|l + j\u27e9|l\u27e9, (9)\nwhere \u03c9 = e2\u03c0i/d. In the case of a three-dimensional system, the algorithm converges to the AME(5, 3) state yielding a measure of approximately 0.96122. Finally, we have G(AME(5, 4)) = 3132 = 0.96875. Here the algorithm yields a state |\u03d55,4\u27e9 with a larger geometric measure, in particular G(|\u03d55,4\u27e9) > 0.975. However, here we cannot identify a closed expression of the state. The numerical result suggests that the maximizer is again an AME state. Maximally entangled subspaces.\u2014 One can extend our\nmethod such that it also applies to subspaces. More precisely, we want to construct an orthonormal basis for a subspace V such that the least entangled state in V is as entangled as possible in comparison with all other possible subspaces. Note that this notion differs from the concept of genuine entangled subspaces (GES) [73], where all states within the subspace have to be genuine entangled. However, our algorithm can readily be modified in order to search for GES with maximal genuine multipartite entanglement. We will explain the idea of the algorithm for a two-\ndimensional subspace of three qubits. First, we choose a two-dimensional subspace randomly, which can be described by a projector of the form P = |v\u27e9\u27e8v| + |w\u27e9\u27e8w|, where \u27e8v|w\u27e9 = 0. Next, we compute the best rankone approximation to P given by taking the argmax of supabc Tr[|abc\u27e9\u27e8abc|P ]. This can be done with the iteration described after Eq. (1). Again we call the optimizer |\u03c0\u27e9. More generally, the optimization yields the best product state approximation to the state in the range of P that is least entangled. In particular, this implies that if im(P ) contains a product state, the assigned geometric measure will be zero. Then we compute the eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues of the operator P \u2212 \u03b8|\u03c0\u27e9\u27e8\u03c0| that we will call |v1\u27e9 and |v2\u27e9. Clearly,\n5 this algorithm reduces to the one from the previous sections, if we choose the rank of the projector to be one.\nIt is known [74], that the maximal dimension of a subspace of an n-partite qudit system which contains no product state is given by dim(V ) = dn \u2212 dn + n \u2212 1. Consequently, for two qubits, the maximal entangled subspace is of dimension one and spanned by a Bell state. Indeed, if we apply our algorithm to larger subspaces, the measure we assign to this subspaces stays zero.\nFor three qubits, the algorithm converges to the W state as one basis vector and to the state\n|V \u27e9 = 1\u221a 3\n[ |011\u27e9+ e 2\u03c03 i|110\u27e9+ e 4\u03c03 i|101\u27e9 ] (10)\nas the other. The subspace spanned by |W \u27e9 and |V \u27e9 then has a remarkable property: all states are maximally entangled, yielding the same geometric measure as the W state. This has potential applications in information processing: In this subspace, qubit states may be encoded and then any set of these states is difficult to discriminate by local means [24].\nConcerning higher dimensions, we computed the maximally entangled subspace of dimension two for two qutrits. Here we obtain an embedded Bell state |\u03c71\u27e9 = (|01\u27e9 \u2212 |10\u27e9)/ \u221a 2 and the state\n|\u03c72\u27e9 = 1\u221a 14\n[ |20\u27e9+ |02\u27e9+ \u221a 6(|21\u27e9+ |12\u27e9) ] (11)\nwhich can also be seen as the superposition of two Bell pairs. It turns out that the least entangled state within this subspace has a geometric measure of 1/2. Again, applications can be envisaged, as any state in this subspace has at least one ebit of entanglement.\nConclusion.\u2014 In this work we have presented an iterative method for the computation of maximally resourceful quantum states. We provided a convergence analysis and showed that in each step the resourcefulness of the iterates increase. We illustrated our approach for the special case of the geometric measure, allowing us to identify interesting quantum states, discover novel AME states, and characterize highly entangled subspaces which may be useful for information processing. We further demonstrated the universality of the algorithm for various other quantifiers, yielding novel forms of correlations in the triangle network.\nConcerning further research, our results also suggest a variety of avenues for further theoretical exploration. Can the algorithm be used to find new AME states for cases where the existence is still open, e.g., for systems consisting of more then five six-dimensional systems, or to find new SLOCC inequivalent AME states? In particular, we have numerical evidence that there exists a second AME state (besides [16]) for the case of four sixdimensional systems. From a mathematical perspective, the algorithm can give insights into the structure of tensor spaces and could offer intuition to solve open problems concerning the asymptotics of tensor norms [47].\nWe thank Guillaume Aubrun, Matthias Christandl, Mariami Gachechiladze, Felix Huber, H.

            "heading": "Appendix A: Proof of Observation 1",
            "text": "Let us first recapitulate the algorithm and fix the notation. Let |\u03c8\u27e9 be the randomly drawn initial state and denote by |\u03c0\u27e9 its best product state approximation (BPA), that is,\n|\u03c0\u27e9 = argmin{|\u03c0\u27e9 : 1\u2212 |\u27e8\u03c6|\u03c0\u27e9|2 : |\u03c0\u27e9 product state}. (12)\nIn particular, we can choose |\u03c0\u27e9 such that \u03bb := \u27e8\u03c0|\u03c8\u27e9 > 0. This allows for the computation of the update direction, |\u03b7\u27e9 := (\u03a0|\u03c8\u27e9)/M, where \u03a0 := 1 \u2212 |\u03c0\u27e9\u27e8\u03c0| is the projector onto the orthocomplement of the span of the BPA |\u03c0\u27e9 and M a normalization such that \u27e8\u03b7|\u03b7\u27e9 = 1. It follows directly that M2 = \u27e8\u03c8|P |\u03c8\u27e9 = 1\u2212 \u03bb2, hence M = \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2. For a\nfixed step size \u03b8 > 0, the update rule is given by\n|\u03c8\u27e9 7\u2192 |\u03c8\u0303\u27e9 := 1 N (|\u03c8\u27e9+ \u03b8|\u03b7\u27e9). (13)\nwhere N is again a normalization. In the following, we will frequently make statements about generic states. In these cases, we require the assumptions that a state is not a product state and that the BPA |\u03c0\u27e9 is unique up to a phase.\nThe first step in order to prove monotonicity of the algorithm is to show that small variations in the initial state can only lead to small variations in the BPA. As we will see, this follows from the more general observation that under certain conditions the value y0, where a function f(x0, y) assumes its minimum (for a given x0), depends continuously on x0. Further, by virtue of the canonical embedding, we can identify any |\u03c6\u27e9 \u2208 Cn with a |\u03c6\u0303\u27e9 \u2208 R2n and consequently we can omit the absolute in Eq. (12). Then we have:\nLemma 1. Let X,Y be compact and f : X \u00d7Y \u2192 R be uniformly continuous. Further, suppose that for x0 \u2208 X the value y0 := argminy\u2208Y f(x0, y) is unique. Then for all \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for all x \u2208 U\u03b4(x0) we have argminy\u2208Y f(x, y) \u2282 U\u03b5(y0), where U\u03b4(x0) and U\u03b5(y0) denote vicinities of x0 and y0, respectively. In other words, the function argmin is continuous in x0.\nProof. For the given \u03b5 we can split the set Y in the vicinity U\u03b5(y0) and its complement U\u03b5(y0). In particular we have\nf(x0, y0) = min y\u2208U\u03b5(y0) f(x0, y)\n< min y\u2208U\u03b5(y0) f(x0, y) =: f(x0, y\u03030), (14)\nthat is, y\u03030 denotes the value where the minimum in U\u03b5(y0) is assumed. Let us denote the difference between the function values as\n\u03be = f(x0, y\u03030)\u2212 f(x0, y0) > 0. (15)\nBy the uniform continuity we can choose \u03b4 > 0 such that for all x\u0303 \u2208 Rn with \u2225x\u0303\u2212 x0\u2225 < \u03b4 and for all y we have\n|f(x\u0303, y)\u2212 f(x0, y)| < \u03be\n2 . (16)\nThen we have\nf(x\u0303, y0) < f(x0, y0) + \u03be\n2 , (17)\nbut for all y \u2208 U\u03b5(y0)\nf(x\u0303, y) > f(x0, y\u03030)\u2212 \u03be\n2 > f(x0, y0) +\n\u03be 2 , (18)\nwhich implies that the minimum of f(x\u0303, y) lies in the vicinity U\u03b5(y0).\n9 Corollary 2. Let |\u03c6\u27e9 be a pure quantum state and suppose that its BPA |\u03c0\u27e9 is unique. Then, for all \u03c4 > 0, there exists a \u03be > 0 such that the BPA |\u03c0\u0303\u27e9 of |\u03c6\u0303\u27e9 \u2208 U\u03be(|\u03c6\u27e9) lies in U\u03c4 (|\u03c0\u27e9).\nProof. The function f(x, y) := |\u27e8x, y\u27e9|2 is continuous on R2n \u00d7 R2n. Further, the space B1 := {x \u2208 R2n : ||x|| = 1} is compact and thus also M := B1 \u00d7 B1. Then, by the Heine-Cantor theorem [75], f is uniformly continuous on M . Since we assume |\u03c0\u27e9 to be unique, we can apply Lemma 1, which guarantees for all \u03c4 > 0 the existence of \u03be > 0 such that |\u03c0\u0303\u27e9 \u2208 U\u03c4 (|\u03c0\u27e9) for |\u03c8\u0303\u27e9 \u2208 U\u03be(|\u03c8\u27e9).\nAccording to Eq. (13), the updated state needs a renormalization given by N = N (|\u03c8\u27e9, \u03b8). The next ingredient for the proof of the main result is a Lemma that gives later an upper approximation of the function 1/N .\nLemma 3. There exists C > 0 such that for all q \u2208 [0, 1] and x > 0 we have\n1\u221a 1 + 2qx+ x2 < 1\u2212 qx+ Cx2. (19)\nMore precisely, the above inequality holds for all C \u2265 3.\nProof. As both sides of Eq. (19) are positive, we can square them such that the inequality remains true. This yields the equivalent inequality\n0 <[2C \u2212 3q2 + 1]x2 + 2q[C \u2212 1 + q2]x3 + [C2 \u2212 C(4q2 \u2212 2) + q2]x4 + 2q[C2 \u2212 C]x5 + C2x6\n=: f2x 2 + f3x 3 + f4x 4 + f5x 5 + f6x 6\n(20)\nNow observe that for each of the constants fk = fk(C) there is a Ck > 0 such that fk(C) \u2265 0 for all C \u2265 Ck. Indeed, we have C2 := max{(1/2)(3q2 \u2212 1), 0}, C3 := 1\u2212 q2, C5 = C6 := 1. The choice of C4 depends on whether q2 \u2265 1/2 or not. If we denote \u03b1 = |4q2 \u2212 2|, we obtain for the case q2 < 1/2 that C2 + \u03b1C + q2 > 0, what is trivially fulfilled for any C \u2265 1. If q2 > 1/2, we need C2 \u2212\u03b1C + q2 > 0. But C2 \u2212\u03b1C + q2 \u2265 C2 \u2212\u03b1C = C(C \u2212\u03b1) > 0, we obtain C > \u03b1. In general, we have C4 := max{1, |4q2 \u2212 2|}. This implies that for C \u2265 C\u0303 := max {Ck | k = 2, ..., 6} all coefficients are positive. Hence 0 < f2x 2 implies 0 < f2x 2 + f3x 3 + f4x 4 + f5x 5 + f6x 6 if x > 0. Consequently, it is sufficient to only consider the problem 0 < f2x 2, what is true for C \u2265 C7 := (1/2)(3q2 \u2212 1). Hence, choosing C \u2265 max{C\u0303, C7} yields the claim. Taking the maximum over all Ck with respect to q \u2208 [0, 1] yields that C > 2.\nTheorem 4. Let |\u03c8\u27e9 be a generic pure quantum state. Then there exists \u0398 > 0 such that for the updated state |\u03c8\u0303\u27e9 according to Eq. (13) with step-size \u0398 > \u03b8 > 0 we have G(|\u03c8\u27e9) < G(|\u03c8\u0303\u27e9).\nProof. Let us start with some step-size \u03b80 > 0 that we will choose in the end appropriately and consider\n|\u03c8\u0303\u27e9 = 1 N (|\u03c8\u27e9+ \u03b80|\u03b7\u27e9). (21)\nIt is important to note that |\u03b7\u27e9 is a normalized state, that is, |\u03b7\u27e9 = 1/( \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2)(1 \u2212 |\u03c0\u27e9\u27e8\u03c0|)|\u03c8\u27e9. This yields \u27e8\u03c8|\u03b7\u27e9 =\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03bb2. The BPA |\u03c0\u0303\u27e9 of |\u03c8\u0303\u27e9 can be parameterized using the old product state, i.e., |\u03c0\u0303\u27e9 = \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b42|\u03c0\u27e9+\u03b4|\u03c7\u27e9, for a normalized,\nappropriately chosen |\u03c7\u27e9 and \u03b4 > 0. Using \u27e8\u03c0|\u03b7\u27e9 = 0 and |\u27e8\u03c7|\u03b7\u27e9| \u2264 1 we obtain\n\u03bb\u0303 := |\u27e8\u03c0\u0303|\u03c8\u0303\u27e9| = 1 N \u2223\u2223\u27e8\u03c0\u0303|\u03c8\u27e9+ \u03b80\u03b4\u27e8\u03c7|\u03b7\u27e9\u2223\u2223 \u2264 1N (|\u27e8\u03c0\u0303|\u03c8\u27e9|+ |\u03b80\u03b4\u27e8\u03c7|\u03b7\u27e9|) \u2264 1N (\u03bb+ \u03b4\u03b80). (22)\nUsing that N = \u221a 1 + 2\u03b80 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2 + \u03b820 and Lemma 3 there exists C > 0 such that\n\u03bb\u0303 < (1\u2212 \u03b80 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2 + C\u03b820)(\u03bb+ \u03b4\u03b80)\n= \u03bb+ \u03b4\u03b80 \u2212 \u03bb \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2\u03b80 + \u03b820 [ C(\u03bb+ \u03b4\u03b80)\u2212 \u03b4 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2 ] = \u03bb+ \u03b80(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03bb \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2) +O(\u03b820). (23)\nNote that \u03bb \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2 > 0, since 0 \u0338= \u03bb \u0338= 1. This comes from the fact that a generic state is not a product state with \u03bb = 1 and any state has at least some overlap with some product state. So, if \u03b4 < \u03bb \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2 we have \u03bb\u0303 < \u03bb for\nsuitably small \u03b80.\n10\nIt remains to show that we can guarantee that \u03b4 obeys this condition. We start with a given value of \u03bb and consider a number 0 < \u03b41 < \u03bb \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2. According to Corollary 2, we can find a \u03b81 > 0 such that |\u03c0\u0303\u27e9 \u2208 U\u03b41(|\u03c0\u27e9) if |\u03c8\u0303\u27e9 \u2208 U\u03b81(|\u03c8\u27e9). Then, this gives us an upper bound on \u03b80 for Eq. (21), so that the resulting \u03b4 < \u03b41 in Eq. (23) is small enough to guarantee a negative slope for the linear term. Still, \u03bb\u0303 < \u03bb is not guaranteed, due to the O(\u03b820) term in Eq. (23). But, for the given values of \u03bb, \u03b41 and C, we can also compute from Eq. (23) a second threshold \u03b82, which guarantees \u03bb\u0303 < \u03bb. Then we can take finally in the statement of the Theorem \u0398 = min{\u03b81, \u03b82} and the proof is complete.\nIt is remarkable that in this proof the fact that |\u03c0\u27e9 is a product state was never used. So, the algorithm can also be used if the overlap with states from some other subset of the (pure) state space shall be minimized. In particular, the given subset must not necessarily be presented in form of a smooth submanifold, but could also be discrete (see Appendix D). Further, the algorithm also applies to the case where each particle may have a different degree of freedom, e.g., C2 \u2297 C3 \u2297 C5. For this, only the subroutine of computing the best rank-1 approximation has to be modified."

Thereupon we analyse how the geometric measure is distributed for small multi-qubit systems and show how the trajectories of the algorithm behave for different (Haar random) starting points.\nAs we want to sample from the set of pure states, i.e., |\u03c6\u27e9 \u2208 (Cd)\u2297n, we can identify the state space with the unit sphere of Cdn . We will denote the n dimensional complex unit sphere by Sn\u22121. Further, we say that a complex-valued random variable X is standard normal distributed, denoted by X \u223c N (0, 1), if the real-valued random variables \u211c(X) and \u2111(X) are independent and standard normal distributed (mean value 0 and variance 1). In order to sample a point uniformly at random according to Haar measure on Sn\u22121, see also Ref. [96] for more detailed explanations, one might consider a sequence (X1, X2, ..., Xn) of normal distributed independent random variables Xk \u223c N (0, 1). Then, by the property of Gaussians, the vector (X1, X2, ..., Xn) \u2208 Cn is a rotationally invariant n-dimensional Gaussian. Normalizing the vector (X1, X2, ..., Xn) yields a uniformly random point on Sn\u22121.\nIn the following we numerically approximate the distribution of entanglement in multi-qubit systems with respect to the Haar measure. The distribution is presented in Fig. 2. For this we have randomly sampled n-qubit states and computed the corresponding geometric measure. For the cases n = 3, 4 we have chosen 105 states. To compute the geometric measure for each of those states, 20 iterations and 20 random starting points were sufficient in order to get a robust output. For n = 5, 6, 7 we have chosen 106 states and the calculation of the geometric measure was implemented using 80 iterations and 100 random starting points, yielding a robust estimate for the geometric measure. More precisely, we regard a computation of the geometric measure as robust, if the variance of the different outputs is smaller than 10\u22127. It should be noted that there is no analytical expression either for the exact distribution of G w.r.t. the Haar measure nor for its moments, e.g., expectation value or variance. However, using the geometric measure of the sampled quantum states we can obtain estimates for the moments of the distribution. In order to get optimal estimates for higher moments, i.e., with small error probabilities, one can use the method of U -statistics [101]. For the mean value, Hoeffding\u2019s inequality yields that the estimated expectation value E[G] is very close to the true\n11\nvalue with very high success probability. The exact numerical values can be found in Tab. II. The geometric measure of typical tensors was also recently numerically investigated in Ref. [102].\nMore generally, there exist bounds which limit the measure of sets of states having a small amount of entanglement [34], see also Appendix I. Particularly, for multi-qubit system composed of more than 11 constituents, one has\n\u00b5Haar[{|\u03c6\u27e9 \u2208 (C2)\u2297n : G(|\u03c6\u27e9) < 1\u2212 8n2\n2n }] \u2264 e\u2212n\n2\n. (24)\nTherefore, if n is large enough, almost all states will have a geometric measure close to 1.\nFurther, we have analyzed how the algorithm from the main text behaves for different starting points for multi-qubit systems. For five different Haar random starting points we have chosen 300 iterations with the same step size \u03f5 = 0.05. Within the computation of the geometric measure in each step, we used 50 iterations and 50 random product states. The exact behaviours can be found in Fig. 3. Here it is important to note that after the iterations each of the states has approximately the same geometric measure. This indicates that at least for the case of a small number of parties, the algorithm is stable with respect to local optima.\n12"

There are two equivalent methods how a graph state could be defined, namely via a quantum circuit in terms of a sequence of commuting unitary two-qubit operations or alternatively using the stabilizer formalism [80]. Here we use the first approach. A graph G = (V,E) is a set of |V | vertices and some edges E \u2282 V \u00d7 V connecting them. The graph state |G\u27e9 associated to a graph G is a pure quantum state on (C2)\u2297|V | built up of Ising type interactions according to\n|G\u27e9 = \u220f\n(a,b)\u2208E CZa,b|+\u27e9\u2297|V |, where CZa,b = 1\u2211 k=0 |k\u27e9\u27e8k|a \u2297 Zkb , (25)\nwhere Zb denotes \u03c3z only acting on system b and similar for 1 a. The operator CZa,b denotes the controlled \u03c3z on system b conditioned to system a. In terms of the stabilizer formalism, the graph state |G\u27e9 corresponds to the unique common eigenstate of all stabilizing operators with eigenvalue +1. More generally, given a graph state |G\u27e9 one can generate a orthonormal basis for (C2)\u2297|V | of common eigenstates, labelled by their eigenvalue signature. For given |G\u27e9 we can obtain this basis by |\u03c9\u27e9 = \u03c3\u03c9z |G\u27e9 where \u03c9 = (\u03c91, ..., \u03c9|V |) \u2208 {0, 1}|V |.

            "text": "The stabilizer rank \u03c7 of a multi-qubit system was first introduced in the context of simulation of Pauli-based quantum computation (PBC), a specific computational model [84]. A PBC on n qubits is given by a sequence of time steps t = 1, ..., n, where for each t one performs a nondestructive eigenvalue measurement of some Pauli operator Pt \u2208 {1 , X, Y, Z}\u2297n and the choice of the particular Pauli operator Pt+1 can depend on the outcome of the measurement at time step t. Each of the n qubits is initialized in a so called magic state |H\u27e9 = cos(\u03c08 )|0\u27e9+ sin( \u03c0 8 )|1\u27e9. After all n operators P1, ..., Pn have been measured, yielding an outcome string s = (s1, ..., sn) \u2208 {\u00b11}n, the final state is discarded. Finally, the obtained outcome string s is converted via a classical post-processing into an output b \u2208 {0, 1}.\nWhile the main aim of Ref. [84] is to quantify how many classical resources (time) are needed in order to simulate a PBC on (n+ k) qubits by a PBC using only n qubits, their introduced method turned out to also improve the cost\n13\nof a brute force full classical simulation. It can be shown that a brute force classical simulation of a n qubit PBC, which includes state operations in the computational basis, has a simulation cost (time) of O(n2n), where n denotes the number of qubits involved in the computation. However, one can devise an algorithm which classically simulates a n qubit PBC in only 2\u03b1npoly(n), where \u03b1 \u2248 0.94 [84]. The idea of the proof is to expand certain n-qubit states as a linear combination of stabilizer states, as n-qubit stabilizer states only require O(n2) classical bits to store [103]. The minimal number of stabilizer states needed is then called the stabilizer rank.\nMore precisely, the set of stabilizer states consists of all states |s\u27e9 that can be generated from some n-qubit Clifford operation U via |s\u27e9 = U |0\u27e9n, where a Clifford operation is a unitary operator which maps via a conjugate action tensor products of Pauli operators to tensor products of Pauli operators, that is,\nCln := {V \u2208 U(2n) |V \u2020PV \u2208 Pn \u2200P \u2208 Pn}. (26)\nEquivalently, one can define Cln as the group generated by the gates H,S,CNOT. For an arbitrary n-qubit state |\u03c8\u27e9, its stabilizer rank \u03c7 is defined as the minimum number r \u2265 1 of stabilizer states needed to represent this state, that is,\n|\u03c6\u27e9 = r\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b1k|sk\u27e9.

            "text": "So far, only for very special states the stabilizer rank is known and only rude upper bounds on the maximal attainable \u03c7 for a n-qubit system have been derived. It is therefore highly desirable, from the practical viewpoint of classical simulation as well as from a theoretical perspective, to know which states cannot be approximated well by stabilizer rank \u03c7 states. For this, we define the stabilizer measure Sk : (C2)\u2297n \u2192 R with\n|\u03c8\u27e9 7\u2192 Sk(|\u03c8\u27e9) := 1\u2212 sup{ |\u27e8\u03c6|\u03c9\u27e9|2 : \u03c7(|\u03c9\u27e9) = k}. (28)\nFor a fixed k, the stabilizer measure in Eq. (28) directly allows for an application of the algorithm. First, generate the set of all stabilizer states and form all subsets of size k. Second, draw an initial state |\u03c8\u27e9 at random. Then, compute the closest stabilizer rank k state, i.e., for given set of stabilizers |s1\u27e9, ..., |sk\u27e9, one has to maximize the overlap of the given state |\u03c8\u27e9 with |\u03c9\u27e9 = \u2211k j=1 \u03b1j |sj\u27e9. This is a constraint optimization over k complex parameters \u03b11, ..., \u03b1k subject to the normalization of the stabilizer rank k state. If the best approximation |\u03c9\u27e9 is found, one updates |\u03c8\u27e9 7\u2192 (1/N )(|\u03c8\u27e9+ \u03b8|\u03b7\u27e9) where |\u03b7\u27e9 = (1 \u2212 |\u03c9\u27e9\u27e8\u03c9|)|\u03c8\u27e9. This procedure is then iterated.\nHowever, the number of n qubit stabilizers S(n) can be computed explicitly [90] and is given by S(n) = 2n \u220fn j=1(2\nj+ 1), which scales exponentially in the number of qubits. For instance, one has S(3) = 1080, S(4) = 36720 and\nS(5) = 2423520. Further, in order to evaluate the overlap with stabilizer rank k states, one has to inspect all ( S(n) k ) different combination and optimize over the k2 \u2212 1 real parameter which becomes infeasible even for small n, k. We therefore consider a non-trivial toy model, where we restrict to a specific subset of stabilizer states. In particular, we consider the set consisting of the graph state bases corresponding to four qubit GHZ-graph and the four-qubit cluster-graph, see Fig. 6, as for four qubits there are only two inequivalent graphs. For each graph, the set of all\n14\neigenstates with a different eigenvalue signature is a basis for (C2)\u22974 and thus our toy model comprises 32 stabilizer states. Note that for one graph, those states form an orthonormal basis, while the set of eigenstates of two graphs displays a highly nontrivial geometric structure. If the optimization in Eq. 28 only runs over this restricted set, we write SRk for the corresponding stabilizer measure. Note that in difference to the geometric measures Gm, two LU-equivalent states do not need to have the same measure Sk, as we try to maximize the overlap w.r.t. a set that is not invariant under LU operations. Of course, the measure Sk of two states which are Clifford equivalent is the same.\nWe have implemented the algorithm for the restricted toy model, see also Fig. 6 (right). We initialized with a random state and iterated 300 times with a step size of \u03b8 = 0.1 until SRk does not increase anymore. Then we change the step size to \u03b8 = 0.01 and iterate again 300 times. The algorithm converges to a state |\u03c8max\u27e9 yielding SR2 (|\u03c8max\u27e9) \u2248 0.8415. A comparison of SR2 for different four-qubit states can be found in Table III.\nAs already mentioned, except from an asymptotic analysis for special states, not much is known about the minimal overlap which a quantum state can have with the set of all stabilizer states [82]. For instance, for tensor products of the magic states |H\u27e9 or |R\u27e9 = cos(\u03b2)|0\u27e9+ ei\u03c0/4 sin(\u03b2)|1\u27e9 with \u03b2 = (1/2) arccos(1/ \u221a 3), the maximum overlap with all stabilizer states |\u03c6\u27e9 on n qubits can be bounded by |\u27e8\u03c6|H\u2297n\u27e9| \u2264 2\u2212\u2126(n) [84]. However, the exact constants appearing in \u2126(n) remain hidden. Here our algorithm could yield states which are difficult to approximate with a fixed stabilizer rank, thus giving new insights into the structure of stabilizer states which may be helpful to find improved bounds."

We conclude this section by discussing a further application, where the measure of interest quantifies how well a given state can be approximated by matrix product states of given bond dimension.\nSchmidt rank, tensor rank and border rank\nApart from the geometric measure there are also other quantifier of entanglement offering different operational interpretations. One such possibility is to quantify the amount of entanglement in a system by its dimensionality. Highdimensional quantum entanglement can be exploited to tolerate larger amounts of noise in quantum communication protocols, making them a valuable resource [88].\nLet |\u03c6\u27e9 be an n-particle quantum state where each constituent is a d-level quantum system. Any such |\u03c6\u27e9 can be written as\n|\u03c6\u27e9 = R\u2211 k=1 \u00b5k|\u03c0(1)k \u27e9 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 |\u03c0 (n) k \u27e9, (29)\nwhere |\u03c0(j)k \u27e9 \u2208 Cd and \u00b5k \u2208 C. Note that the different summands |\u03c0 (1) k \u27e9 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 |\u03c0 (n) k \u27e9 do not have to be orthogonal as in the case of the Schmidt decomposition of bipartite pure states. The minimal number of terms R needed in order to decompose |\u03c6\u27e9 into the form in Eq. (29), i.e., into a sum of rank-1 tensors, is called the tensor rank of |\u03c6\u27e9 and is denoted by rk(|\u03c6\u27e9). The decomposition of |\u03c6\u27e9 in Eq. (29) is also called rank decomposition or minimal CP decomposition [86].\n15\nThe Schmidt measure P of a state |\u03c8\u27e9 is defined as P (|\u03c6\u27e9) := log2 rk(|\u03c6\u27e9) [97]. Clearly, in the case of a bipartite system, the minimal number of rank-1 terms needed is given by the Schmidt rank of the state. Once P is defined for pure states, one can extend it to the full state space of mixed quantum states in a natural way, i.e., via a convex roof construction [98]. The Schmidt measure gives also rise to an approximation version similar to the geometric measure. For this, define the generalized geometric measure Gk : (Cd)\u2297n \u2192 R with\n|\u03c6\u27e9 7\u2192 Gk(|\u03c6\u27e9) := 1\u2212 sup{ |\u27e8\u03c6|\u03c9\u27e9|2 : rk(|\u03c9\u27e9) = k}, (30)\nwhich measures how well a given quantum state |\u03c6\u27e9 can be approximated by a state of tensor rank k. Therefore, it gives more detailed information about the entanglement structure present in the state |\u03c6\u27e9, and repro-\nduces the geometric measure G for the special case k = 1. Clearly, the generalized geometric measure is a decreasing function in the rank k, that is, for given |\u03c6\u27e9 we have G(|\u03c6\u27e9) = G1(|\u03c6\u27e9) \u2264 G(|\u03c6\u27e9) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 G\u00b5(|\u03c6\u27e9), where \u00b5 is the maximal rank that a tensor in (Cd)\u2297n can have. For instance, for the bipartite case CdA \u2297 CdB , the Schmidt decomposition directly leads to \u00b5 = min{dA, dB}. For the case of three qubits, it is known [91] that \u00b5 = 3, but for the general case only not tight upper bounds exist. Obviously, if we find Gk(|\u03c6\u27e9) = 0, then Gk\u0303(|\u03c6\u27e9) = 0 for all k\u0303 \u2265 k. The algorithm for maximizing the measure Gk then proceeds as follows. First, draw the initial state |\u03c6\u27e9 at random and compute its best rank-k approximation, that is,\n|\u03c9\u27e9 := argmin {|\u03c9\u27e9 : 1\u2212 |\u27e8\u03c6|\u03c9\u27e9|2 : rk(|\u03c9\u27e9) = k} (31)\nComputing rank-k approximations\nThere are different methods to compute low rank approximations to a given tensor, most prominently the CP-ALS algorithm, which updates each mode individually by a least-squares optimization while keeping all other modes fixed. For a concise summary of those methods, see Ref. [86]. However, to keep notation simple, we will generalize the algorithm mentioned in the main text for higher rank approximations, which we will illustrate for the three-particle case. For a given state |\u03c8\u27e9 \u2208 (Cd)\u22973 consider the Schmidt decomposition |\u03c8\u27e9A|BC = \u2211D k=1 \u03bbk|\u03c8Ak \u27e9|\u03c8BCk \u27e9. For the overlap with a rank k state given by Eq. (29) one finds\n\u27e8\u03c8|A|BC\u03c0\u27e9 = D\u2211 j=1 r\u2211 k=1 \u03bbj\u03b1k\u27e8\u03c8Aj |\u03c0 (A) k \u27e9\u27e8\u03c8 AB j |\u03c0 (B) k \u27e9|\u03c0 (C) k \u27e9 = r\u2211 k=1 \u27e8\u03b3\u0303k|\u03c0(A)k \u27e9, (32)\nwhere we have defined \u27e8\u03b3\u0303k| = \u2211D j=1 \u03bbj\u03b1k\u27e8\u03c8ABj |\u03c0 (B) k \u27e9|\u03c0 (C) k \u27e9\u27e8\u03c8Aj |. Note that |\u03b3\u0303k\u27e9 is not normalized and we denote by\n|\u03b3k\u27e9 its normalized version. The norm is given by \u03b1\u2032k = \u221a \u27e8\u03b3\u0303k|\u03b3\u0303k\u27e9. We now update the states of system A as well as the coefficients \u03b1k that appear in the decomposition as |\u03c0Ak \u27e9 7\u2192 |\u03b3k\u27e9 and \u03b1k 7\u2192 \u03b1\u2032k. This procedure is iterated with respect to each mode and repeated many times. In order to reduce the sensitivity for local maxima, different randomly chosen starting points |\u03c0\u27e9 should be used.\nTo test the reliability of the algorithm, we apply it to quantum states for which the tensor rank is already known. For instance, one has rk(|GHZ\u27e9) = 2, rk(|W\u27e9) = 3 and rk(|W\u27e9\u22972) = 7 [87]. However, one should notice that for tensor approximations of higher rank (k \u2265 2) the problem of degeneracy exists, reflecting that the set of tensors of rank k is open which is in contrast to the matrix case. In particular, for the bipartite (matrix) case the Eckart-Young theorem ensures that the best rank k approximation is simply given by the eigenvectors corresponding to the k largest singular values. Further it is known that deflation techniques, i.e., compute best rank 1 approximation, subtract it and then iterate, are not fruitful for tensors.\nA tensor is degenerate if it may be approximated arbitrarily well by tensors of lower rank. Also well known [50, 86], we will discuss this phenomenon for the case of the W state. The W state |W\u27e9 = (1/ \u221a 3)(|001\u27e9 + |010\u27e9 + |100\u27e9) has\ntensor rank 3, but can be approximated arbitrarily well by tensors of tensor rank 2. Consider the family of rank 2 states\n|\u03c0(\u03b1)\u27e9 = \u03b1 N\u03b1 (|0\u27e9+ \u03b1\u22121|1\u27e9)\u22973 \u2212 \u03b1 N\u03b1\n|0\u27e9\u22973 with N\u03b1 = \u221a 3 + 3\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b1\u22124, (33)\nwhere N\u03b1 assures that \u27e8\u03c0(\u03b1)|\u03c0(\u03b1)\u27e9 = 1 for all \u03b1 > 0. It directly follows that \u27e8W|\u03c0(\u03b1)\u27e9 = \u221a 3/ \u221a 3 + 3x\u22122 + x\u22124 which tends to 1 for x \u2192 \u221e. To emphasize that problem, one also says that the W state has border rank 2. Therefore, it is not surprising that our approximation algorithm yields that G2(|W\u27e9) is numerically 0. As it turns out, the generalized geometric measure Gk has also the advantage that it distinguishes more clearly between different forms of entanglement, e.g., the L state and the M state. In particular, one finds that G3(|L\u27e9) = 0 while G3(|M\u27e9) \u2248 0.2626.\n16"

            "text": "The smallest case where a maximization of G2 could be considered is in principle (C2)\u22973. Here it is known that there are only two classes of genuine multipartite entanglement with respect to SLOCC, namely GHZ and W [58]. Further, the tensor rank is monotonically decreasing under SLOCC operations [97]. In particular, one can show that the set of all tensors of rank three is the closure of the SLOCC orbit of the W state. However, the W state has border rank two and thus all states within his orbit. This implies the nonexistence of border rank three tensors in (C2)\u22973. As a consequence, the algorithm cannot be applied to this case, as in each step the given state can be approximated arbitrarily well by states of rank 2. Therefore the first nontrivial case is a system of four qubits with respect to rank two and three. Here, states of border rank three and four exist and are subsets of non-vanishing measure. We implement the algorithm with 20 different random initial points for each case. For the case of rank 2, we identify the state to be in 7 of the 20 runs the M state and in the other cases the four qubit cluster state. Further, the numerical computation of G2 for |C4\u27e9 is stable with respect to a randomization of the starting point and one finds G2(|C4\u27e9) = 1/2.\nIn this case, the rank two approximation found by the algorithm yielding the value G2(|C4\u27e9) = 1/2 can proven to be optimal. The cluster state is a graph state and we can consider the bipartition 23|14 (see Fig. 6). This effectively yields the four-dimensional maximally entangled state |00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9 + |22\u27e9 + |33\u27e9. Because all singular values coincide, we can choose the best rank two approximation as |00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9 which yields a squared overlap of 1/2. As Gm(|\u03c8\u27e91234) \u2265 Gm(|\u03c8\u27e912|34) this proves the optimality. However, as the M state is not a graph state the situation is different. For the computation we choose 106 random starting points and make 300 iteration for each. The total computation was running for 27 hours. The optimal approximation found by the algorithm yields G2(|M\u27e9) = 5.000003(9). This suggests that G2(|M\u27e9) = 1/2 which would imply that the maximizer of G2 is not unique anymore in contrast to G1. For the case of rank 3 approximations, the algorithm converges for all 20 starting points to the M state. With a similar computation as for G2 we find that G3(|M\u27e9) = 0.2626050. However, the algorithm can not be applied to maximize Gk for \u2265 4. This is due to the fact, that randomly drawn tensors in (C2)\u22974 can be approximated well by rank 4 tensors.\nApproximation to matrix product states\nIn general, it is an open question which forms of nontrivial quantum dynamics can be simulated efficiently by classical means. However, it is a celebrated result that if the computation only involves pure states containing a restricted amount of entanglement, such an efficient simulation is possible [94]. The power of those simulation algorithms rely on the fact that if the entanglement present in the multi-qudit state |\u03c8\u27e9 is bounded, a low-dimensional sparse representation of |\u03c8\u27e9 can be derived. This is the so-called matrix product state (MPS) representation. A MPS\n17\nof bond dimension \u03c7 can be written as\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = d\u2211\ni1,...,in=1\ntr[A[1]i1 \u00b7 ... \u00b7A[n]in ] |i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 in\u27e9 (34)\nwhere A[l]il \u2208 Mat\u03c7(C) for l = 1, ..., n. Any state |\u03c6\u27e9 can be represented as a MPS if the bond dimension is sufficiently large [94]. For a fixed number of parties n with local dimension d we write MPS(\u03c7) for the set of all MPS with bond dimension \u03c7. Notice that MPS(\u03c7) is a manifold in state space, which coincides with the set of product states for \u03c7 = 1 and has a nested structure, i.e., MPS(\u03c7) \u2282 MPS(\u03c7+1). In particular, this shows that computing the best MPS approximation of given bond dimension \u03c7 to a given state |\u03c6\u27e9 is a hard problem which includes for \u03c7 = 1 a NP-hard problem [40, 50].\nRecently, a variant of the geometric measure was introduced, where the distance is measured with respect to the set of matrix product states of a given bond dimension \u03c7 [92]. How well a generic multi-particle quantum state can be approximated by matrix product states of bond dimension \u03c7 is then quantified by Ek : (Cd)\u2297n \u2192 R with\n|\u03c8\u27e9 7\u2192 Ek(|\u03c8\u27e9) := 1\u2212 sup{|\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c9\u27e9|2 : |\u03c9\u27e9 \u2208 MPS(\u03c7)} (35)\nAs already pointed out in Ref. [94], the tensor rank is not a continuous function. Consequently, there exist states |\u03c8\u27e9 that need a high bond dimension to be represented exactly, but very good approximations w.r.t. some norm exist where the optimizer has a significantly lower bond dimension. This property could then be used to obtain efficient simulations with small errors, even for seemingly high entangled states. Therefore, finding states which are difficult to approximate by states with fixed bond dimension is important as they do not allow for an efficient classical approximate simulation and can thus be regarded as genuine quantum resources.\nFurther, upper bounds on the distance between an arbitrary n-particle state |\u03c8\u27e9 and the set of MPS(\u03c7) can be derived [81]. Indeed, one can show that for any |\u03c9\u27e9 \u2208 MPS(\u03c7) one has\n|| |\u03c8\u27e9 \u2212 |\u03c9\u27e9 ||2 \u2264 2 n\u22121\u2211 k=1 \u03f5k(\u03c7) (36)\nwith \u03f5k(\u03c7) := \u2211dk j=k+1 \u03bb [k] j , where \u03bb [k] j are the Schmidt coefficients of the bipartition [1...k]|[k + 1...n] and dk is the local dimension of the smaller of the two subsystems for that bipartition. Here our algorithm can find states for which the bound in Eq. (36) will be maximal and thus gives information about its tightness."

For simplicity, in the following we will restrict to the triangle network and assume that the independent sources distribute pairs of qubit systems. Note that our algorithm can also be applied to more advanced network topologies as well as to higher local dimensions. Following Ref. [85], we call this network the independent triangle network, abbreviated ITN. From the structure of the network, see also Fig. 8 (middle), we obtain that a state |\u03c8\u27e9 can be prepared in the ITN if and only if there exist unitaries UA, UB , UC and bipartite states |a\u27e9, |b\u27e9, |c\u27e9 such that\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = UA \u2297 UB \u2297 UC |abc\u27e9 (37)\nHere it is important to note that the order of the subsystems is different for the unitaries and the states. For instance, UA acts on the joint system A1A2 while |a\u27e9 defines the joint state between B2C1. We denote the set of all states that can be prepared by means of two-qubit sources by \u2206I . However, it turns out that \u2206I admits a highly nontrivial structure [85]. Indeed, \u2206I is not convex, certain separable (product) states are not contained and it is a subset of measure zero within the entire set of quantum states. This renders its analysis and characterisation difficult and not much is known about the structure of this set.\nAs triangle states constitute an important resource, it is an interesting question how well a given quantum state can be approximated by states from \u2206I . In order to quantify this property, we define the triangle measure T : (Cd)\u22976 \u2192 R\n18\nwith\n|\u03c8\u27e9 7\u2192 T (|\u03c8\u27e9) := 1\u2212 sup {|\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c9\u27e9|2 : |\u03c9\u27e9 \u2208 \u2206I} (38)\nClearly, for any ITN preparable state we have T = 0.\nComputing the best network state approximation\nSimilar to the problem of finding the best rank one or best rank k approximation to a given state in the computation of the generalized geometric measures Gk, one can also devise a seesaw type algorithm for computing the ITN state which maximizes the overlap [85]. We will shortly recapitulate this algorithm. For simplicity, let us assume that the given target state |\u03c8\u27e9 is composed out of six qubits. We initialize the algorithm with a unitary for each party UA, UB , UC and a state for each source |a\u27e9,|b\u27e9,|c\u27e9. Now, if we keep the unitaries fixed, finding a better choice for the source states can be seen as finding the best rank one approximation with respect to a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 system. After updating the source states, we have to optimize for the unitaries. To compute the optimal choice for UA, define the new state |\u03c8\u0303\u27e9 = 1A \u2297 UB \u2297 UC |\u03c8\u27e9. Then one has [85]\nmax UA |Tr[UA \u2297 1B \u2297 1C |\u03c8\u0303\u27e9\u27e8abc|]| = max UA |TrA[UA\u03c1A]| (39)\nwith \u03c1A = TrBC [|\u03c8\u0303\u27e9\u27e8abc|]. From the singular value decomposition of \u03c1A = UDV \u2020 one can then derive the optimal form of UA as UA = V U\n\u2020. Alternating this two optimizations multiple times gives a good approximation to the optimal state. However, it should be noted that similar to the rank one approximation routine, this algorithm is prone to local maxima. In order to stabilize the optimal solution one should use multiple random initial choices."

This procedure is iterated. In the simplified case of only two parties and two independent sources, the problem of triangle preparability reduces\nto the multilevel entanglement problem [83], see Fig. 8 (left).

Further, to compute the best network state approximation, i.e, the optimal unitaries and source states, we choose 100 iterations in the seesaw routine and 500 different initial points. This maximization procedure is iterated 200 times. Then, the step size is changed to \u03b8 = 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 while we also increase the precision of the computation of the approximation. While the seesaw routine always makes 100 iterations, the number of random starting points was 1000, 1500, 3000 respectively. For each of the choices, the maximization was done for 200 steps. After 800 optimization steps in total there was no increase in the measure T and the fluctuations were of the same size as those arising in the computation of the best network state approximation. The convergence of the algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 8 (right). The state found by the algorithm, denoted by |\u03c8max\u27e9, yields a triangle measure T very close to 0.6, see Tab. IV. This is very interesting as this state outperforms all states that have a high triangle measure known so far [85]. Further, the state shares an interesting entanglement structure. One finds that while the one-body marginals onto the first five systems have all the same spectrum (0.4, 0.6), the marginal onto system six is approximately pure, hence unentangled with the remaining particles."

            "text": "In the following we explain our choice of the step-size \u03b8, the number of iterations and the duration of the computation. First, it should be noticed that the algorithm contains the computation of the closest product state as a subroutine. Because the used seesaw is prone to local maxima, we randomize the algorithm, i.e., we run the iteration for many different initial states. The number of iterations as well as the number of initial states depends on the number of parties and the local dimension. The iteration typically converges fast, e.g. for three qubits 10 iterations are sufficient and for five ququads 30 iterations. The number of initial states can be chosen small if the system size is small, e.g., for three qubits 10 different initial points make the largest overlap robust, while for larger systems more initial states are necessary, e.g., for five ququads 100 points have to be taken.\nThe step-size \u03b8 used in the update rule Eq. (13) depends on the size of the system and on the variation of the measure of the iterates. For systems of small and moderate size, we initially choose \u03b8 = 0.01. After a certain number of iterations (mostly around 400) the measure of the iterates is not increasing anymore, but fluctuates around a certain value where the amount of fluctuation depends on the step-size. In this case, the step-size is reduced via \u03b8 = \u03b8/2 and one proceeds with the new step-size. However, if \u03b8 becomes small it is also useful to improve the precision in the computation of the best product state approximation.\nBecause the update rule resembles the idea of a gradient descent (GD), we can make use of advanced gradient descent techniques as the cumulated momentum method (CM) [76] or Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient (NAG) [57]. In the general setting one aims to minimize a (typically complicated and high-dimensional) real-valued function f(\u03c9). Suppose that one initializes the parameters to \u03c90. In the GD, the parameters are iteratively updated according to \u03c9t+1 = \u03c9t \u2212 \u03bat, where \u03bat = \u03b8t(\u2207\u03c9f)(\u03c9t) with step-size \u03b8t > 0, and (\u2207\u03c9f)(\u03c9t) is the gradient of f evaluated at \u03c9t. The idea behind CM is to keep track about the directions we are moving in parameter space. For a given momentum parameter \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1] the update is given by \u03bat = \u03b3\u03bat\u22121 + \u03b8t(\u2207\u03c9f)(\u03c9t). Clearly, \u03bat is a running average of previously calculated gradients. The advantage of using CM is that the momentum enhances the decrease in directions with small gradients while suppressing oscillations in high-curvature directions.\nFor NAG, the idea is to not calculate the gradient with respect to the current parameter \u03c9t, that is (\u2207\u03c9f)(\u03c9t), but at the expected value of the parameters given the recent momentum, that is, (\u2207\u03c9f)(\u03c9t) + \u03b3\u03bat\u22121. Accordingly, the NAG update rule is given by \u03c9t+1 = \u03c9t \u2212 \u03bat where \u03bat = \u03b3\u03bat\u22121 + \u03b8t(\u2207\u03c9f)(\u03c9t + \u03b3\u03bat\u22121).\nThe update rule in Eq. (13) naturally invites for two different variants. First, as introduced in the main text, the update direction |\u03b7\u27e9 = (1/ \u221a \u27e8\u03c8|\u03a0|\u03c8\u27e9)\u03a0|\u03c8\u27e9 can be re-normalized. This has the consequence that the amount of the\nshift stays constant for all iterations. However, a second option would be to take just the projected (un-normalized) state \u03a0|\u03c8\u27e9 as the update. Here, the size of the shift changes within each iteration, depending on how large the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is supported within the subspace im(\u03a0).\n20"

Hence, generically each component of the tensor is nonzero. However, in order to understand the structure of the state, we seek for a concise representation in which most of the coefficients vanish. As we consider two states to be equal if there is a LU-transformation connecting them, this requires a parametrization of the set of unitary matrices. First notice, that U(d) is the semidirect product of U(1) with SU(d) and hence we can restrict to parametrizations of SU(d). For qubits, one can make use of the fact that SU(2) is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere S3. In particular, an arbitrary SU(2) matrix can be written as\nU =\n( \u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\u2217\n\u03b2 \u03b1\u2217\n) , \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C with |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. (41)\nConsequently, the parametrization involves four real parameters and one quadratic constraint. However, for d \u2265 3 the SU(d) is not homeomorphic to a sphere anymore, or a product of them, e.g., SU(3) is not homeomorphic to S8. Consequently, for systems of higher dimensions different approaches exist [77\u201379]. In our work, we have used the Jarlskog parametrization [78], what is a simple recursive scheme for parametrization, which can be easily implemented numerically. First, notice that any X \u2208 U(d) can be written as X = \u03a6\u03b1Y \u03a6\u03b2 where \u03a6\u03b1 = diag(ei\u03b11 , ..., ei\u03b1d), \u03a6\u03b2 similar and Y a unitary d\u00d7d matrix. Now, Y is decomposed into a product of unitaries, that is, Y = \u220fd k=2Ad,k with\nAd,k =\n( A(k) 0\n0 1 d\u2212k\n) , U(d) \u220b A(k) = ( 1 d\u22121 \u2212 (1\u2212 cos(\u03b8k))|ak\u27e9\u27e8ak| sin(\u03b8k)|ak\u27e9\n\u2212 sin(\u03b8k)\u27e8ak| cos(\u03b8k)\n) , (42)\nwhere |ak\u27e9 \u2208 Cd\u22121 normalized to one, i.e., \u27e8ak|ak\u27e9 = 1 and \u03b8k \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) an arbitrary angle. We now describe how this parametrization can be used to bring the numerically found states into a concise form.\nHere, two different cases can be considered. If one has a guess for the possible state, e.g., the marginals are all maximally mixed so one expects an AME or k-uniform state, one could compute the fidelity between the numerical state |\u03c8\u27e9 and the guess |\u03c6guess\u27e9, i.e., sup|\u27e8\u03c8|U1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Un|\u03c6guess\u27e9|. If there is no possible candidate, the idea is to minimize a function f : U(d)\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7U(d) \u2192 R depending on the state, which becomes minimal if many entries of the state vanish. For instance, given the state |\u03c8\u27e9 a natural candidate would be f(U1, ..., Un) = \u2211 |(U1\u2297\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2297Un|\u03c8\u27e9)i1,...,in |. Given two states |\u03d5\u27e9, |\u03c8\u27e9 we regard them as equal, if F(|\u03c8\u27e9, |\u03d5\u27e9) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03f5 with \u03f5 < 10\u22126, where F denotes the fidelity.\n21\nAppendix I: Relation to known upper bounds\nIn this section we discuss fundamental upper bounds on the geometric measure. More precisely, for a given physical system H = \u2297kHk with Hk \u223c= Cdk one can assign the following value\nG(H) := sup{G(|\u03c6\u27e9) : |\u03c6\u27e9 \u2208 H} (43)\nwhich is characteristic for the space H. Indeed, it can be shown that G(H) is directly related to the inradius of BH1\u2297\u0302 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297\u0302BHn , where BHj denotes the unit ball in Hj and \u2297\u0302 is the projective tensor product [47], which is for two closed convex sets K1,K2 defined as K1\u2297\u0302K2 = conv{x \u2297 y |x \u2208 K1, y \u2208 K2}. We now want to find upper (tight) bounds on G(H), bounding the maximal amount of entanglement that can be present in the system. However, similar to the question of maximal tensor rank, this turns out to be a hard question with only partial answers so far [89]. A trivial upper bound can be obtained directly from the normalization of the state. Indeed, given an arbitrary state |\u03c8\u27e9 \u2208 (Cd)\u2297n there must exist a tensor product of computational basis states |j1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 jn\u27e9 such that |\u27e8\u03c8|j1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 jn\u27e9|2 \u2265 d\u2212n. Consequently we have that G((Cd)\u2297n) \u2264 1 \u2212 d\u2212n. Although the derivation of this bound is trivial, it is difficult to obtain improved bounds. For instance, one could also consider upper bounds from a convex relaxation\ninf |\u03c8\u27e9 sup |\u03c0\u27e9 |\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c0\u27e9|2 = inf \u03c1\u2208S sup \u03c3\u2208SEP Tr[\u03c1\u03c3] \u2265 sup \u03c3\u2208SEP inf \u03c1\u2208S Tr[\u03c1\u03c3] = sup \u03c3\u2208SEP\n\u03bbmin(\u03c3) = 1\ndn , (44)\nwhere S is the set of mixed states associated to H and SEP \u2282 S the set of separable states. The first equality is true due the convexity of the objective function and the fact, that pure states / product states are the extreme points of S / SEP. Further, for any bounded function f(x, y) one has supx f(x, y) \u2265 f(x, y) \u21d2 infy supx f(x, y) \u2265 infy f(x, y) and thus we obtain infy supx f(x, y) \u2265 supx infy f(x, y). The last equality is attained for the maximally mixed state. However, it should be noted that this coincides with the trivial upper bound. This bound is not tight, even not for two qubits.\nAnother open problem regards the asymptotic scaling of the geometric measure of multi-qubit systems (see Problem 8.27 in [47]). Here the question is whether there exists a constant C > 0 and for any n \u2265 1 a quantum state |\u03c8\u27e9 \u2208 (C2)\u2297n such that G(|\u03c8\u27e9) \u2265 1 \u2212 2\u2212nC. If |\u03c8\u27e9 \u2208 (C2)\u2297n is randomly chosen according to the Haar measure, with high probability it fulfills G(|\u03c8\u27e9) \u2265 1\u2212 2\u2212nCn log(n), i.e., there is a parasitic factor n log(n) [47]. Note that this bound is an improved version of Eq. (24) if the number of particles is large. Although we cannot solve that problem here, we can put bounds on the constant C under the assumption that the optimal states found by the algorithm are indeed the global optimizers of the geometric measure. If Gmax,n denotes the maximal measure of a n qubits system, we have Cn \u2265 Cmin,n = 2n(1\u2212Gmax,n). One can see in Tab. V that the lower bound Cmin of the constant C grows with the number of qubits. In particular, the increase of Cmax is not decreasing with the number of qubits n as one would expect if there would exist a constant C which is independent of n. Indeed, in this case one would have Cmin \u2264 C\u0303 < \u221e for all n and as optimal constant C one can simply take the maximum (what exists by assumption) over all the Cmin.\nAlso for the special case of symmetric states an upper bound on the geometric measure can be derived [95]. Here it should be noted that the space of symmetric quantum states is much smaller then the space of all states. Indeed, while\n22\nthe state space for n qubits has dimension 2n, the space of symmetric states only has dimension n+ 1. In particular, one can show that for a n qudit system, the geometric measure is upper bounded by G \u2264 1\u2212 1/c where c = ( n+d\u22121 n ) , which follows from a similar normalization argument as the upper bound for generic states, but restricting to the Dicke basis. For n qubits this yields the bound G \u2264 1\u2212 1/(n+ 1), which is at least for a small number of parties not tight. However, it is interesting to see that for n \u2265 5, the maximal entangled state found by the algorithm violates that bound.\nThe maximal entangled state with respect to the geometric measure in a certain tensor space H = \u2297kHk has also an interpretation from the viewpoint of normed vector spaces. First note that ||\u03c8||\u03c3 = sup|\u03c0\u27e9|\u27e8\u03c0|\u03c8\u27e9| is a norm on H. Further, because H is finite dimensional, all norms on H are equivalent, i.e., if || \u00b7 || and ||| \u00b7 ||| are two norms on H, then there exist constants C1, C2 > 0 such that C1 ||\u03c8|| \u2264 |||\u03c8||| \u2264 C2 ||\u03c8|| for all (possible un-normalized) vectors \u03c8 \u2208 H. In our case, the two norms are given by || \u00b7 ||\u03c3 and || \u00b7 ||2. From this perspective, our algorithm is solving the problem\nC := min { ||\u03c8||\u03c3 ||\u03c8||2 : \u03c8 \u2208 H} (45)\nTherefore, knowing C > 0 implies that ||\u03c8||\u03c3 ||\u03c8||\u221212 \u2265 C for all \u03c8, thus C|| \u00b7 ||2 \u2264 ||\u03c8||\u03c3. Because the algorithm yields the minimizing state explicitly the inequality is tight, hence the found constant C is optimal."
