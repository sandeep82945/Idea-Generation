1. **Investigate the long-term effects of the lifting intervention on musculoskeletal injuries among healthcare workers.** This could be done through a longitudinal study that follows a group of healthcare workers who receive the intervention and compares their injury rates to a control group who does not receive the intervention.


2. **Examine the effectiveness of the lifting intervention in different healthcare settings.** For example, the intervention could be tested in hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics to see if it is effective in reducing injuries in all of these settings.


3. **Explore the impact of the lifting intervention on patient safety.** This could be done by examining the rates of patient falls and other injuries that occur during patient handling tasks.


4. **Develop and evaluate a training program for healthcare workers on the lifting intervention.** This would help to ensure that healthcare workers are properly trained on the intervention and are able to perform it correctly.


5. **Investigate the cost-effectiveness of the lifting intervention.** This would help to determine whether the intervention is a worthwhile investment for healthcare organizations.
