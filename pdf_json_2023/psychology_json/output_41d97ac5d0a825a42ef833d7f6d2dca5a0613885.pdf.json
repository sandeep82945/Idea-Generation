    "abstractText": "Targeted protein degradation using heterobifunctional chimeras holds the potential to expand target space and grow the druggable proteome. Most acutely, this provides an opportunity to target proteins that lack enzymatic activity or have otherwise proven intractable to small molecule inhibition. Limiting this potential, however, is the remaining need to develop a ligand for the target of interest. While a number of challenging proteins have been successfully targeted by covalent ligands, unless this modification affects form or function, it may lack the ability to drive a biological response. Bridging covalent liganddiscoverywith chimeric degraderdesign has emerged as apotential mechanism to advance both fields. In this work, we employ a set of biochemical and cellular tools to deconvolute the role of covalentmodification in targeted protein degradation using Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase. Our results reveal that covalent targetmodification is fundamentally compatiblewith theprotein degrader mechanism of action.",

Brown 1 & Matthew F. Calabrese 1\nTargeted protein degradation using heterobifunctional chimeras holds the potential to expand target space and grow the druggable proteome. Most acutely, this provides an opportunity to target proteins that lack enzymatic activity or have otherwise proven intractable to small molecule inhibition. Limiting this potential, however, is the remaining need to develop a ligand for the target of interest. While a number of challenging proteins have been successfully targeted by covalent ligands, unless this modification affects form or function, it may lack the ability to drive a biological response. Bridging covalent liganddiscoverywith chimeric degraderdesign has emerged as apotential mechanism to advance both fields. In this work, we employ a set of biochemical and cellular tools to deconvolute the role of covalentmodification in targeted protein degradation using Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase. Our results reveal that covalent targetmodification is fundamentally compatiblewith theprotein degrader mechanism of action.\nOver the past two decades, the application of chimeric degraders has rapidly expanded from chemical biology tools to clinical assets1,2. Despite tremendous progress, the majority of advanced chimeric degraders still focus on well-validated ligandable targets. This underscores a critical gap in the field, as we witness a growing list of genetically validated proteins that are devoid of discernable small molecule binding sites3. One approach to address this challenge lies in the development of covalent ligands, which often utilize an electrophilic functional group to target a cryptic pocket and partially compensate for limited non-covalent binding affinity4. While this presents an opportunity to ligand even non-enzymatic targets, it may still present a gap in terms of modulating a pharmacodynamic response4\u20137. This has led to growing interest in incorporating these ligands as components of protein degraders8\u201310.\nCovalency in chimeric degraders has been widely explored in the context of E3 ligase binders11\u201313. This strategy has the advantage of expanding the E3 ligase toolbox for TPD, while preserving the catalytic nature of chimeric degraders14, as a covalent E3-ligand complex can still take part in multiple rounds of substrate turnover. In contrast, covalent modification on the target protein may reduce the catalytic activity of this mechanism, which may raise the dose required to\nachieve a therapeutic level of degradation, depending on the protein levels and the rate of resynthesis. Nevertheless, chimeric degraders that covalently modify targets have been conceptually validated from the first degrader reported by Sakatomoto et al targeting MetAP-21, to more recent examples involving KRAS and ERK1/215\u201319. However, while these studies are supportive, they do not demonstrate that a stable covalent modification actually precedes cellular degradation. Similarly, while approaches such as HaloTag-targeting chloroalkane degraders (HaloPROTACs)20,21 provide valuable chemical biology tools to interrogate target function, they provide only limited insights into covalent degrader function, owing to the more labile nature of the ester bonds utilized.\nBruton\u2019s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) represents a therapeutically relevant protein that can be explored for covalent degraders. BTK, a validated target for B-cell malignancies, presents a reactive cysteine (C481) in the ATP binding pocket of the kinase domain that has been co-opted for the development of potent covalent inhibitors, including approved therapeutics such as ibrutinib22,23. The rise of clinical mutations that are refractory to current therapies has presented a need for new therapeutic approaches, including degraders. Prior work has established that BTK is a robust target for non-covalent and reversible\nReceived: 19 June 2022\nAccepted: 15 February 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Discovery Sciences, Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, Groton, CT, USA. e-mail: Matthew.Calabrese@pfizer.com\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1189 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\ncovalent chimeric degraders, with several molecules progressing to Phase 1 clinical trials (Beigene (NCT05006716); Nurix (NCT04830137, NCT05131022); Haisco (NCT04861779)). However, differing reports as to whether covalent irreversible BTK chimeras can drive efficient degradation have resulted in uncertainty around the consequences and context of the covalent modification itself24\u201328.\nFinally, while the protein degrader mechanism of action is predicated on the formation of a productive target-degrader-E3-ligase ternary complex, structural insights into these complexes remain few, with no examples yet representing a covalent assembly29\u201339. In addition, despite its wide utility in the protein degrader field, the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP1) remains limited in terms of deep mechanistic characterization40.\nWe, therefore, set out to expand our understanding of target recruitmentwithin the frameworkof covalent degraders targeting BTK and co-opting cIAP1. Here, we show that covalently modified BTK is a bonafide target for proteasomal degradation and structurally represents yet another unique ternary complex pose for this protein combination."

            "text": "As a starting point for our work, we selected an irreversible covalent degrader (referred to throughout this study as BTK-cIAP1-Covalent degrader (BCCov)), from a previously disclosed series built from an Ibrutinib-like BTKwarhead fused to a known ligand of the IAP family of E3 ligases26,41 (Fig. 1A). To provide a comparator compound incapable of forming a covalent bond with BTK, an analog of BCCov was prepared where the reactive acrylamide double bond was replaced with a\nnon-reactive single bond, referred to hereafter as BTK-cIAP1-NonCovalent degrader (BCNC) as reported previously (Tinworth et al. Compounds 6, 7)26,41.\nPrior studies have shown differing results for covalent irreversible BTK degraders with some reports of potent and robust activity24,27, while others show only weak or ineffective degradation25,26. However, results are sometimes complicated by the fact that many of these degraders still retain a high affinity for BTK, even in the absence of covalent modification. In order to delineate covalent modification from degradation, we established an adaptable system using HEK293 cells (Expi293). In contrast to the B-cell lineage, Expi293 cells lack endogenous expression of BTK. Combined with a low apparent basal expression of cIAP1, they provide an opportunity to exogenously regulate cellular degradation conditions. Thus, using a transient transfection system to introduce full-length BTK (BTKFL), BTKFL-C481S, and full-length cIAP1 (cIAP1FL) (Supplementary Fig. 1), we generated a system that is responsive to cIAP1-dependent BCCov-mediated degradation of BTKFL (Fig. 1B).\nTo examine the importance of covalent modification we performed dose-dependent degradation using BCNC and BCCov with cells expressing either BTKFL or BTKFL-C481S. Consistent with previous studies24,42, we observe similar DC50 values throughout (Fig. 1C\u2013F) suggesting an ability of BCCov to function through both covalent and non-covalent recruitment of BTK. In order to validate degradation specificity, we generated a BTK gatekeeper mutant (BTKT474I) as well as a C481S/T474I double mutant (BTKT474I-C481S) in which the ligand binding ability of BTK is impaired (Supplementary Fig. 2A)43 and observed the expected loss of activity. Finally, in order to compare to a more relevant endogenous system, we used a THP-1 cell line which natively\nand BCNC (E, F) mediated dose-dependent degradation of BTKFL and BTKFL-C481S. Quantification and DC50 plot for degradation of BTK FL or BTKFL-C481S across 3 separate experiments shown in panel. Mean values were plotted with SEM Error bars.

As a first step, we transfected Expi293 cells with BTKFL but without cIAP1FL, a condition that promoted no observable ligand-induced BTK degradation (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Using a high concentration of BCCov (20 \u00b5M) with a single overnight time point (18 h), we performed denaturing intact mass spectrometry on immunopurified BTKFL and observed a mass-shift consistent with the [BTK~BCCov] covalent adduct for nearly the entire detected population of BTKFL (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 1). In order to confirm the assignment of this modification (~BCCov), we performed a far western blot on this immunopurified BTKFL using recombinant biotinylated cIAP1BUCR1 which is capable of binding to the IAP warhead exposed in the [BTK~BCCov] complex (Fig. 2A, inlay). Using StreptavidinHorse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) to detect the biotinylated cIAP1BUCR1, we obtain results mirroring the mass spectrometry profile and validating the\nidentity of the BTK adduct as [BTK~BCCov]. A parallel experiment using BTKFL-C481S reveals no similar adduct, confirming the specificity of the modification (Supplementary Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data suggest that covalent [BTK~BCCov] formation can occur in this context.\nIn order to test whether covalent modification precedes BTK degradation, we performed a set of parallel time-course studies (Fig. 2B\u2013D; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). In one assay BTKFL was cotransfectedwith cIAP1FL, treatedwith 5 \u00b5MBCCov anddegradationwas measured by western blot over time. In the second assay, BTKFL was transfected in the absence of exogenous cIAP1, treated with an equivalent amount of BCCov, and analyzed by mass spectrometry at matched intervals. As shown in Fig. 2B\u2013D, we observed degradation starting as early as 30min and reaching a plateau by the 7-hour timepoint. Intriguingly, covalent modification occurs on a similar, though slightly slower time scale, suggesting that covalently modified BTK may form during the degradation time course. By comparison, BTKFL-C481S degrades at a slower rate, likely reflecting a slightly reduced affinity of the BTK warhead toward this mutant42,44 (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). Thus, although timescales appear compatible, the ability of modified BTK to serve as a target for the proteasome remains unclear.\nFig. 2 | BCCov covalently labels BTK in cells.

            "text": "To more convincingly demonstrate whether covalently modified BTK is capable of serving as a degradation substrate, we used our transient transfection system to conduct sequential modification and degradation assays. We first assessed the fraction of cellular BTK that could be modified after an 18-hour incubation, with increasing concentrations of BCCov in the absence of transfected cIAP1 (Supplementary Fig. 3C). Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we observe that after treatment with a 20 \u00b5M dose of BCCov we can reproducibly achieve approximately 94% BTK covalent modification (n = 5, 93.6 \u00b1 1.7%), and this level remains stable for at least 48 h posttreatment (Supplementary Fig. 3D). Importantly, we did not observe a non-specific BTKFL~BCCov population forming as a result of the immunoprecipitation process itself (Supplementary Fig. 3E). In order to test for degradation of pre-formed BTK~BCCov covalent complex, we established an inducible (T-REx) cIAP1FL system, in which expression of cIAP1FL is turned on only upon cell treatment with tetracycline (Supplementary Fig. 3F). In the absence of tetracycline, our pool of [BTKFL~BCCov] remains intact, consistent with repression of cIAP1FL expression. However, induction of cIAP1FL promotes robust degradation of BTKFL with Dmax ~70%, demonstrating strong reduction of the starting [BTKFL~BCCov] pool (Fig. 3A, B). In order minimize possible contributions from engagement of any newly synthesized BTK, we included an additional experiment with extensive compound washout after BTK labeling which yielded consistent results.\nAs an additional orthogonal study, we performed an in vitro degradation assay using covalently modified recombinant BTK. In brief, purified BTKFL was covalently labelled with BCCov and repurified (desalted) to remove excess compound (Supplementary Fig. 3G). This [BTKFL~BCCov] was then subjected to in vitro ubiquitination, generating a distribution of high molecular weight ubiquitinated conjugates\n(Fig. 3C). Addition of this sample to our Expi293 lysate shows loss of ubiquitinated [BTKFL~BCCov] in a proteasome-dependent manner, confirming compatibility of this degradation substrate (Fig. 3D, E).\n[BTK~BCCov] can form a productive ternary complex Based on the cellular results above, we moved on to characterize the interactions between BTK, BCCov, and cIAP1. This was accomplished using an in vitro reconstituted system comprised of BTK\u2019s kinase domain (BTKKD) and an enzymatically active truncated form of cIAP1 (cIAP1BUCR1)45,46 as previously described40 (Supplementary Fig. 1). To remove complexities arising fromkinetics of covalent bond formation, we started with a pre-formed a BTKKD~BCCov irreversible binary complex, [BTKKD~BCCov]. As before, complex formation was measured by intact mass spectrometry with desalting to remove excess degrader (Supplementary Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table 1).\nOur first assay utilized size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SECMALS) to assess E3 ligase recruitment (Supplementary Fig. 4B)47,48. In this experiment, while the interaction between the covalent BTK~BCCov complex and cIAP1 is formally described as a binary interaction, we maintain the ternary complex nomenclature in order to align with established norms in the protein degradation field in reference to target-chimera-E3 ligase complexes. Though some conformational heterogeneity is apparent in the major peak, analysis reveals the formation of a complex between BTKKD~BCCov and cIAP1BUCR1, as well as a [cIAP1BUCR1-BCNC] and BTKKD complex, with an approximate 2:2 or 1:2 stoichiometry (BTKKD: cIAP1BUCR1), consistentwith our prior reportwith non-covalent analogs40, and aligned with chemical cross-linking tracked by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 4C, D). Lastly, we observe a cIAP1-dependent ubiquitination of BTKKD~BCCov, suggesting no fundamental defect in ternary complex formation and ubiquitin transfer (Supplementary Fig. 4E).\nFig. 3 | CovalentlymodifiedBTK is degraded.

Here we used biolayer interferometry (BLI), to analyze BTKKD~BCCov binding to cIAP1BUCR1 as a measurement of complex formation. We demonstrated a relatively tight ternary complex (Kd = 72.5 nM), similar to a [cIAP1\nBUCR1 -BCNC] binary complex binding BTKKD (49.8 nM), suggesting that the cIAP1 affinity is not substantially impacted by the BTK~BCCov covalent bond (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). Interestingly, while the ternary complex affinity remains relatively high, it is nevertheless weaker than the binary affinity measured against cIAP1 alone (Supplementary Fig. 5C). While the tight affinity and slow off-rate of BCCov to cIAP1BUCR1 presented a challenge in determination of absolute Kd we can confidently assign an affinity of \u2264 10 nM, which is in close agreement with the ~16 nM affinity reported for the IAP warhead alone41. This allows us to set an upper limit for the cooperativity factor (\u03b1 =Kd binary/Kd ternary) of \u22640.2 for BCCov, suggesting a relatively tight, yet negatively cooperative ternary complex.\nBCCov drives a distinct ternary complex structure In order to gain deeper insights into the topology and interactions of the BTK covalent ternary complex, we shifted our efforts to structural studies. Focusing on the ligand binding domains of both BTK (kinase domain \u2013 BTKKD) and cIAP1 (Bir3 domain\u2013cIAP1Bir3), we performed extensive crystallization trials in the presence of stoichiometric BCCov - ultimately yielding a 3.0 \u00c5 (2.3 \u00c5 anisotropic) structure of the ternary complex inwhich the covalent attachment of BCCov toCysteine 481 of BTK is unambiguously resolved (Fig. 4A, B; Supplementary Table 2). The resulting electron density map provides clear density over the entirety of the ligand, providing high confidence inmodeled trajectory\nand geometry, and reveals yet another ternary complex pose for this target/E3 ligase pair40 (Fig. 4C, D).\nWhile modest electron density precludes complete side-chain modeling, we can nevertheless observe conformational changes in BTK that are different from the previously reported ibrutinib-bound structure (RCSB 5P9J49). This includes a striking outward flip of F559 allowing this aromatic sidechain to pack against the cyclohexyl moiety of the cIAP1 ligandof BCCovwithin the contextof the ternary complex, highlighting the flexibility and induced contacts in this non-native assembly (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the cyclohexyl group of BCCov ligand also appears dynamic and adopts a unique rotation as compared to the binary BCCov-cIAP1Bir3 structure that we have additionally solved for comparison (Supplementary Fig. 5D, E). Nevertheless, despite the apparent favorable interaction between F559 and BCCov, this contact appears to be dispensable for BCCov-mediated BTK degradation, as the F559Amutant retains potent cellular degradation, binding kinetics, and ternary complex formation (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that there is sufficient plasticity in the accessible conformations to compensate energetically. Finally, we observe a series of intimate lipophilic contacts between BTKKD and cIAP1Bir3 including several proximal to the F559/BCCov interaction with alternating residues zippering at the interface (Fig. 5C).\nTernary complex solution ensemble To validate our crystallographic findings and assess the conformation of BTKKD-BCCov-cIAP1Bir3 in solution, we performed 2-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments as previously described40. Here, uniformly [13C,15N]-labelled cIAP1Bir3 was pre-incubated with either BCCov [cIAP1Bir3 + BCCov] to generate a cIAP1Bir3-BCCov binary complex, or\nBTKKD\nC481\ncIAP1Bir3\nC481\nBCCov\nC\nB\nA BCCov\ncIAP1Bir3 (BCCov) 890 A2\ncIAP1Bir3 (BCPyr) 1120 A2\ncIAP1Bir3 (BC5P) 255 A2 530 A2 832 A2 BTKKD D\nFig. 4 | Ternary complex crystal structure of BTKKD~BCCov-cIAP1Bir3.

Addition of BTK leads to perturbations in residues within the C-terminal helices and preceding loops (Fig. 5D, E), consistent with the interface observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 5B, C). In addition, severe line-broadening occurred for a specific set of residues near the cIAP1 binding site (Fig. 5D) which is indicative of slow conformational exchange on the \u03bcs-to-ms time scale and may reflect multiple binding modes of BCCov to cIAP1Bir3,50."

            "text": "The emergence of covalent reversible and irreversible protein degraders potentiates an exciting new avenue to modulate degradation extent and specificity. While there is a theoretical predicted loss of catalytic degradation, irreversible covalent degraders may provide an attractive approach against at least a subset of targets24,27. Here, we present a study of an irreversible-covalent degrader (BCCov) of BTK as the target, and cIAP1 as the E3 ligase. We demonstrate that a covalent bond can be formed prior to proteolysis, illustrating that covalent ligands are fundamentally compatible with targeted protein degradation.\nWe first determined that BCCov leads to potent degradation of BTK. In order to dissect this process, we established an engineered cellular system that allowed us to interrogate the distinct steps in this process through selective expression of both target and E3 ligase. By limiting the expression of cIAP1, we confirm the ability of BCCov to\ncovalently modify BTK in cells, in a timeframe that is consistent with the observed kinetics of degradation.\nTo confirm that covalently modified BTK is compatible with proteasomal degradation, we established a tetracycline-inducible cellular system to allow us to pre-form a stable population of covalently modified BTK~BCCov, and subsequently initiate the degradation of this labelled pool. In parallel, we generated ubiquitinated BTK~BCCov which we utilized as a substrate for in vitro degradation assays in cell lysate. Here we note that prior reports in different cellular systems have shown much weaker or limited BTK degradation with analogous covalent molecules to those reported here25,26. However, the contextdependent nature of degrader potency across cell types and systems has beenbroadly noted andmay relate to alterations in abundance and functional state of target and E3 ligase, alterations in protein resynthesis rates, aswell as changes in post-translationalmodifications or recruitment to binding partners and complexes \u2013 any or all of which may impact degrader potency. We, therefore, caution that suchmodel systems are used most appropriately to demonstrate mechanistic compatibility, rather than to interrogate absolute potency.\nAfter establishing that BTK~BCCov is a competent species for degradation, we turned to a suite of in vitro assays to characterize the biophysics and structureof its recruitment to the E3 ligase cIAP1. Using SPR, NMR, multi-angle light scattering, and chemical crosslinking, we unambiguously confirm the ability of this BTK~BCCov to take part in a stable ternary complex with cIAP1.

When compared to prior BTK/cIAP1 ternary complexes40, this represents a fifth crystallographic snapshot, highlighting the breadth of topologies that can be achieved for even a single E3-ligase/target pair and from closely related degraders (Fig. 4D). Here, we observe a direct interaction between the cIAP1 warhead of the degrader with an outward-flipped BTK phenylalanine (F559), a residue that is mutated in an immuneimpaired disease termed X-linked Agammaglobulinemia51,52. While this residue forms an induced contact with BCCov, it is nevertheless dispensable for degradation, consistent with flexibility in this complex and suggesting that potencymight be retained even in the presence of some emerging interface mutations. Despite these intimate proteinprotein contacts, the BTK~BCCov-cIAP1 ternary complex exhibits negative cooperativity. While this may involve energetic trade-offs in the conformation and entropy of the ligand, there may also be unfavorable steric clash between the C terminal Helix of cIAP1Bir3 and the A-loop of BTK. Modeling of this region was done cautiously, as density pertaining to both cIAP1 and BTK nearly intersect, with the A-loop of BTK appearing unstructured and potentially strained (Fig. 5B).\nFinally, whileBCCov andBCNC lead to potent degradation of BTK, analysis of the degradation profiles reveals an interesting observation. Of the four degrader/BTK combinations characterized (BCCov +BTKFL; BCCov + BTKC481S; BCNC +BTKFL; BCNC+BTKC4C481S), we observe a partial hook effect only for the pairing that permits covalent BTK recruitment (BCCov + wt BTKFL) (Fig. 1C, D, Supplementary Fig. 7B), though not in THP-1 cells with endogenous levels of BTK and cIAP1 (Supplementary Fig. 2B). This phenomenon could be intensified for covalent irreversible degraders, owing to the increase in binary occupancy afforded by the covalent bond which here may approach saturation as evidenced by our mass spectrometry titration (Supplementary Fig. 3C). While these observations are consistent with a\ngreater hook effect for our covalent analog, the possible in vivo consequences of this effect remains unclear, due to the dynamic nature of dosing, distribution, and metabolism.\nInterestingly, comparing degradation profiles for both WT and C481S BTK as well as for BCCov and BCNC, reveals that, for this experimental system, covalent reactivity is not essential. However, as covalentmodification increases with both time and concentration, the balance between these paths may shift for higher doses and/or longer durations of treatment. As such, we propose a model for BTK degradationby BCCov that contains pathways associatedwith both covalent and non-covalent recruitment of BTK, where the population of each branch is governed by experimental conditions (Fig. 6). While noncovalent binding by BCCov is likely dominant at nanomolar levels, balance may shift toward covalent recruitment as concentrations reach themicromolar range. Looking to prior studies, we see that even for potent degraders, pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies are often conducted athighmultiples of cellular DC50\n53\u201357. In the case of ARV-771, PK studies show a plasma Cmax of ~1.7 \u00b5M after a single 10mg/kg sc dose and concentrations >2 \u00b5M in 4 of 8 rodents tested in a subchronic tumor growth inhibition study53. Similarly, micromolar exposures are also reported for the BTK degrader SJF620 at 1mg/kg IV as well as the cIAP-directed degrader SNIPER-87 (at 10mg/kg)55,56. Indeed, in vivo testing of our prior BTK degrader, PROTAC 10, gave plasma and spleen levels of ~2\u20133 uM following a single high-concentration subcutaneous dose57, suggesting that functional consequences at high concentrations are relevant factors in degrader design.\nTaken together, we demonstrate that covalent target recruitment is wholly compatible with targeted protein degradation. The extent to which covalent states are populated will be governed by a variety of factors including those intrinsic to the degrader such as potency and reactivity as well as those that can be tuned through study design (ex: dose range, frequency). In the case of BCCov where covalent and noncovalent recruitment span a continuum, covalent labeling is most likely to come into play at Cmax or in any compartments that show degrader accumulation, while non-covalent degradation may predominate at lower exposures. As such, this may represent a feature\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1189 7\nthat can be exploited or avoided in future degrader designs in order to fine-tune both safety and efficacy. Extending to the family of targets that lack readily ligandable pockets, the covalent degradation pathway offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on targeted protein degradation for classically undruggable targets."

Spectra were analyzed using ChemLaunch v1.6.8 (Healex Systems), Mass Hunter V7.0 (Agilent Technologies), and BioConfirm v8.0 (Agilent Technologies). For all proteins analyzed, approximately 2\u03bcl of 0.1\u20130.4mg/ml protein sample was added to 8\u03bcl 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Sigma T6508\u2013100mL). Subsequently, 5\u03bcl of each sample was injected onto the instrument. Depending on the resolution, the amount of protein loaded was altered. Theoretical versus observed molecular weight is presented in Supplementary Table 1. While we have not experimentally determined the post-translational modifications (PTMs) resulting in observed molecular weight, we believe a loss of methionine and acetylation are likely. Variations between theoretical and observed masses may also be due to the resolution of the deconvoluted spectra leading to imperfect peak identification, particularly for a protein with heterogeneous phosphorylation states. Variation of several Daltons is observed between biological replicates and individual experiments.\nLastly, the unrelated impurity that is occasionally observed is likely an artifact of the FLAG antibody immunoprecipitation\nexperiment or a low protein concentration injection resulting in a lower signal-to-noise ratio. As it is observed with BTKFL~C481S immunopurified from cells lacking BCCov treatment, we are confident it is not related to a specific covalent modification resulting from a chimeric degrader."

Instead, BTKKD was incubated separately with 4x molar excess BCCov until completely covalently modified (as determined by mass spectrometry). Excess compound was desalted using a Zeba Spin Desalting Column (Cat. #89882). The preformed binary complex was then dipped into varying concentrations of analyte diluted in Octet buffer for 300 s to determine kon, followed by a wash for 500 s to determine koff. Binding kinetics were calculated and plotted using BiaEvaluation Software (version 4.1.1). Cooperativity (\u03b1) was determined by calculating the ratio of binary Kd to ternary complex Kd."

Experiments were carried out with n = 4 at 6 concentrations, with the highest concentration of 37 nM and subsequent 3-fold dilutions. BCCov was injected at a flow rate of 30 \u00b5L/min, total contact time of 120 s, and dissociation times of 5000 s, using the Single Cycle Kinetics experiment. Binding responseswere processedusing theBiacore 8k software to zero, x-align, double reference, and correct for excluded volume effects of DMSO in the data.\nNote, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6C, a higher concentration of injectant (12 nM) showed a slower on-rate and overall response unit signal due to incomplete removal of the initial 4 nM injectant. These data suggest even with extensive washes, the slow off-rate kinetics do not permit complete removal of compound, making subsequent analysis difficult.\nSize exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering SEC MALS was performed using Wyatt Technology\u2019s Dawn Heleos-II and Optilab T-rEX. Briefly, a Shodex KW400G-4A column was preequilibrated in 20mM HEPES pH 8, 100mM NaCl, and 2mM TCEP. Either cIAP1BUCR1 with BCCov, or a preformed BTKKD~BCCov or BTKKD-F559A~BCCov with cIAP1BUCR1, were incubated for 30min at room temperature. 30 \u00b5L of each sample was injected and run at a 0.375mL/min flow rate.

Within 3\u20135 days single crystals formed. Crystals were extremely difficult to reproduce, likely due to dynamic ternary complex formation kinetics combined with covalent bond formation rate.\nThe binary crystal structure cIAP1Bir3 and BCCov was obtained by adding 8mg/mL cIAP1Bir3 and 1mM BCCov, incubating for 30min at room temperature, centrifuged at 15Kxg for 20min at 4 \u00b0C. 200 nL of the binary complex solution was added to 200 nL of well solution (0.17MSodiumAcetate, 0.085MTrisBasepH8.5, 25.5%w/v PEG4000, 15% v/v glycerol).

Refinement was primarily conducted using autoBUSTER61 and Coot62, and figures were generated in PyMOL (version 1.243pre; Schr\u00f6dinger). The proteins will be deposited to the protein data bank with accession codes cIAP1Bir3-BCCov (8DSF) and cIAP1Bir3-BCCov-BTKKD (8DSO) with 0% Ramachandran outliers respectively.

The reaction was quenched by adding 20 \u00b5M PYR41 E1 inhibitor on ice for 30min. Ubiquitination was confirmed by western blotting using 1:1000 dilution of anti-BTK monoclonal antibody (Clone D3H5 Cell Signaling Technology Cat. #8547) and anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:2,000 (Life Technologies Cat. #31460).\nDegradation reactions were performed using Expi293 clarified lysate prepared as previously described63 with some modifications. Briefly, Expi293 cells, pre-transfected with cIAP1FL from a pCDNA3.1 plasmid, were diluted to 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in a total of 50mL. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 1mL proteasomal\nlysis buffer (50mMHEPES 7.5, 10mMNaCl, 1.5mMMgCl2, 1mMEDTA, 1mM EGTA, 250mM sucrose, 5mM DTT).

Proteasomal dependence was determined by adding 50 \u00b5M MG132 (Millipore-Sigma #474790) or equivalent amounts of DMSO. After 30min reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling at 95 \u00b0C for 10min. Total ubiquitinated BTK was detected through western blotting using a 1:250 dilution of anti-BTK monoclonal antibody (D3H5) and 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit HRP. Over time high molecular weight species decrease over time, potentially due to dUB activity, uninhibited proteasomal activity, or BTKFL instability over time. However, MG132-dependent degradation was observed and easily reproducible.\nKinase domain ubiquitination reactions were performed as described previously40. Briefly, 5 \u00b5M of preformed binary complex, biotinylated BTKKD~BCCov, was mixed with 0.3 \u00b5M E1 (Boston Biochem Cat. #E300), 0.85 \u00b5M UbcH5b, and 50 \u00b5M ubiquitin (Millipore-Sigma Cat#U5382), and a buffer comprised of 20mMTris-HCl pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 5mM ATP, 2mM MgCl2 and 2mM DTT.
