Edward Wen, BA ; and Cyrus Steppe, BA, MS (Medical Student)\nEditorial Decision date: June 8, 2023; online publish-ahead-of-print June 14, 2023.\nIn this Video Commentary, we agree with the authors\u2019 desire to quantify the improvement in \u201cemotion\u201d of varying facelift techniques through artificial intelligence (AI), as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d approach to objectively judging surgical results (Video).1 We mildly disagree with the authors in using \u201cemotion\u201d as a way of judging results and felt that a more practical and clinically relevant measure would be determining the effects on attractiveness of these varying techniques. We also prefer to use \u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d over AI to investigate the type of questions asked in this paper because it can give the researcher the opinion of a very large number of evaluators, like AI, but with the benefit of allowing the gathering of information on the demographics of the evaluators, leading to a much clearer picture of how different groups judge the level of attractiveness."
