Exploration of Other Pollutant Targets: While this study focused on the removal of Cr(III), Co(II), and Ni(II) from water, future research could investigate the effectiveness of the γ-Fe2O3NPs-peptide magnetogels in capturing other toxic pollutants, such as arsenic, mercury, and lead, as well as organic contaminants. Comparative studies could help to broaden the applicability of these nanohybrids in water purification technologies.

Enhancement of Adsorption Capacity and Efficiency: Optimizing the synthesis process of the magnetogel to increase its adsorption capacity and efficiency could be a significant area of research. This could involve modifying the hydrogel matrix composition, the type and amount of magnetic nanoparticles used, or the introduction of additional functional groups to target specific pollutants more effectively.

Mechanism Elucidation of Pollutant Adsorption: A deeper understanding of the interactions between the pollutants and the magnetogel at the molecular level could lead to improved designs of the adsorbent material. Studies using advanced spectroscopic and microscopic techniques could elucidate the adsorption mechanism, including the role of magnetic fields in enhancing pollutant capture.

Reusability and Regeneration of Magnetogel: Assessing the long-term stability, reusability, and regeneration of the magnetogel adsorbents is crucial for practical applications. Future research could focus on developing methods for easy recovery and regeneration of the adsorbent while maintaining high efficiency and capacity for pollutant removal over multiple cycles.

Scale-up and Real-World Application Studies: Scaling up the production of γ-Fe2O3NPs-peptide magnetogels and evaluating their performance in real-world water treatment systems would be an essential step towards commercialization. Pilot studies could assess the effectiveness, cost-efficiency, and operational challenges of integrating these magnetogels into existing water treatment infrastructures.
