A brain tumor is a lethal neurological disease that affects the average performance of the brain and can be fatal. In India, around 15 million cases are diagnosed yearly. To mitigate the seriousness of the tumor it is essential to diagnose at the beginning. Notwithstanding, the manual evaluation process utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) causes a few worries, remarkably inefficient and inaccurate brain tumor diagnoses. Similarly, the examination process of brain tumors is intricate as they display high unbalance in nature like shape, size, appearance, and location. Therefore, a precise and expeditious prognosis of brain tumors is essential for implementing the of an implicit treatment. Several computer models adapted to diagnose the tumor, but the accuracy of the model needs to be tested. Considering all the above mentioned things, this work aims to identify the best classification system by considering the prediction accuracy out of AlexNet, ResNet 50, and Inception V3. Data augmentation is performed on the database and fed into the three convolutions neural network (CNN) models. A comparison line is drawn between the three models based on accuracy and performance. An accuracy of 96.2% is obtained for AlexNet with augmentation and performed better than ResNet 50 and Inception V3 for the 120th epoch. With the suggested model with higher accuracy, it is highly reliable if brain tumors are diagnosed with available datasets.

Based on the observed results, the following conclusions are made:
AlexNet performs better than Resnet 50 & Inception V3 for the particular data set given based on better symmetric scale. However, the accuracy is slightly more stable in ResNet 50. As the number of epochs increased, the accuracy improved for all three models. The obtained accuracy at the 120th epoch for AlexNet is 98.24% with data augmentation. Relatively, ResNet 50 & Inception V3 are 93.51% and 92.07%, respectively. With data augmentation, AlexNet outperforms both ResNet 50 and Inception V3. Hence, it is concluded that AlexNet is the most preferred out of all the three CNN models used in this work when data augmentation is applied. Without augmentation, prediction accuracy obtained by the three models diminished significantly. Therefore, the AlexNet model can be effectively used for brain tumor classification with data augmentation. Though the accuracy of the AlexNet shows best scale comaratively, it has the limitation of particularly highly unstable characteristics. To sum up, the AlexNet model offers the best accuracy scale compared with the other two considered models, still the stability of the accuracy needs to be maintained for the increasing epoch.
