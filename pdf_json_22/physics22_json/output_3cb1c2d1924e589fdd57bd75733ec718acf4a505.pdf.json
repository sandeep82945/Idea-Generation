    "abstractText": "The Darcy ternary hybrid nanofluid flow comprising titanium dioxide (TiO2), cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) and magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles (NPs) through wedge, cone, and plate surfaces is reported in the present study. TiO2, CoFe2O4, and MgO NPs were dispersed in water to synthesize a trihybrid nanofluid. For this purpose, a mathematical model was calculated to augment the energy transport rate and efficiency for variety of commercial and medical functions. The consequences of heat source/sink, activation energy, and the magnetic field are also analyzed. Such problems mostly occur in symmetrical phenomena and are applicable to engineering, physics, and applied mathematics. The phenomena were formulated in the form of a nonlinear system of PDEs, which are simplified to the system of dimensionless ODEs through similarity replacement (obtained from symmetry analysis). The obtained set of differential equations is resolved through a parametric continuation approach (PCM). Graphical depictions are used to evaluate and address the impact of significant factors on energy, mass, and flow exchange rates. The velocity and energy propagation rates over a cone surface were greater than those of a wedge and plate versus the variation of Grashof number, porosity effect, and heat source, while the mass transfer ratio under the impact of a chemical reaction and activation energy over a wedge surface was higher than that of a plate.",

            "text": "Researchers are devoting special attention to hybrid nanofluid flow across different geometries, such as a wedge, plate, and vertical cone, due to its wide range of applications in science and industry [1\u20133]. Rawat et al. [4] numerically examined steady micropolar fluid in the existence of a magnetic flux, mixed convection, and thermal radiation over two different configurations, cone and wedge. Gul et al. [5] documented and examined the comportment of nanofluids, and hybrid NFs allowed for moving freely on an expanding sheet. As opposed to conventional ferrofluid, the hybrid NF is more efficacious in a heat passage. Chamkha [6] addressed the mass and energy transmission properties of viscous nanofluids flowing through converging\u2013diverging sheets with extending or decreasing walls across MHD nanoliquid flow. Bilal et al. [7] described the unsteady thermoconvective\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2419. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14112419 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2419 2 of 16\nflow of nanofluid through an absorbent extended container with mass and energy conversion. Reddy and Reddy [8] investigated the nanofluid flow over the top of slice with slip conditions and chemical reactions. It is observed that as the angle of the wedge component is increased, the heat dispersion of the liquid becomes more intense in both stable and unsteady scenarios. Makinde et al. [9] studied the influence of linear heat flux, an exterior electromagnetic field, heat source, and buoyant force on the viscous fluid stream with heat allocation in three distinct topologies (cone, plate, and wedge). Relative to the two other shapes, the thermal boundary layer is more effective in flow through a wedge than that through a plate and cone. Algehyne et al. [10] reported that the nanofluid flow consists of motile microbes and nanomaterials through a permeable vertical stirring sheet. With the effects of porosity and inertial effect, the drag coefficient decreased. He and Abd et al. [11], and Marin et al. [12] numerically investigated the viscous dissipation affects over nanofluid flow across a shrinking and stretching surface. Another recent study was related to fluid flow over distinct geometries [13\u201320]. When compared to conventional fluids, the trihybrid nanoliquid performs well in the transition of energy conduction. Hybrid nanoliquids have an inclusive series of thermal properties and applications [21]. Hybrid nanoliquids are employed in heat exchangers, the car industry, ships, electric chillers, and broadcasters. In this study, we used a trihybrid nanofluid consisting of TiO2, CoFe2O4 and MgO. TiO2 is an inorganic chemical that has been utilised for over a decade in a number of applications. It is reliable because of its phosphorescence, and nontoxic and nonreactive characteristics. It is the world\u2019s brightest and frostiest substance, with reflecting properties and a UV light absorption capability that can protect from skin cancer [22\u201325]. MgO is a stain-resistant material that occurs naturally and serves as a magnesium source. Its overall structure comprises Mg2+ and O2\u2212 ion connections. Bilal et al. [26] investigated the upshots of electromagnetic interaction on energy transference through water-based hybrid nanocomposites via twin turning discs. Ullah et al. [27\u201329] examined the influence of Darcy\u2013Forchheimer and Coriolis force on nanofluid flow consisting of CNTs in ethylene glycol across a circling edge. Krishna et al. [30] mathematically investigated the effects of ion slip and Hall on an unstable laminar MHD convection revolving flow of second-grade fluid across a semi-infinite upward sliding porous medium. Arif et al. [31] revealed the comportment of ternary hybrid NF in Al2O3, Graphene and CNTs. The trihybrid nanoliquid boosted the energy transmission ratio up to 33.67%, as compared to the nano and hybrid nanoliquids. Sahoo et al. [32] used CNTs, Al2O3, and graphene ternary hybrid NF to reduce heat transmission in a condenser. Fattahi and Karimi [33] used a ternary hybrid nanofluid to conduct and test solar-panel efficiency with the use of the hybrid nanofluid. Some related works and uses of CoFe2O4 and Cu NPs in solvent for biological and production purposes can be found in [34\u201337]. Magnetisation is a crucial part of production and engineering that has a wide range of applications. The quality of heat transmission, compressors, and clutches, among other manufacturing goods, is affected by the collaboration of fluid NPs with a magnetic flux. Magnetisation can regulate the refrigeration rate in a wide range of industrial equipment. Countless academics contributed fluid mechanics research papers that explained flow properties when a magnetic field was applied. Hayat et al. [38] observed the upshot of a created magnetic field and thermal extension on the oscillating transport of nanofluid via an upright channel. The influences of the pre-exponential constituent and heat conservation in MHD mixed convection flow along an irregular surface were documented by Raju et al. [35]. Some new studies on MHD ternary and simple hybrid nanoliquid can be found in [39\u201342]. Following the above discussed studies, the computational modeling of Darcy\u2013Forchheimer ternary hybrid nanofluid flow via porous wedge, cone, and plate has not yet been inspected. Therefore, our contributions are given as follows:\n\u2022 To mathematically model the Darcy\u2013Forchheimer ternary hybrid nanofluid flow via a porous wedge, cone, and plate.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2419 3 of 16\n\u2022 A trihybrid nanofluid is prepared by dispersing TiO2, CoFe2O4, and MgO NPs in base liquid water. \u2022 The Lorentz and gravitational effects are considered to see the variations in hybrid nanofluid motion. \u2022 A mathematical model is obtained with the objective of optimizing energy transmission rates and productivity for a variety of commercial and medical applications.

The velocity field was dramatically reduced by the effect of the magnetic field, Darcy\u2013Forchheimer term, porosity term, and NP volume fraction, while augments with the positive variation of thermal Grashof number. Physically, the resistive force (Lorentz force) opposes the flow field which causes the decline of velocity contour. That repellant force is generated due to the effects of the magnetic flux as shown in Figure 2. Similarly, the rising values of Darcy\u2013Forchheimer and porosity constraints enhance the surface permeability, which results in the deceleration of velocity outlines f \u2032(\u03b7), as displayed in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The inclusion of ternary NPs to the base fluid magnified its viscosity and density, and created a hurdle in the flow field, as shown in Figure 5. The variation in the thermal Grashof number reduces the stretching velocity of cone, wedge, and plate, and diminishes the kinetic viscosity, which provides a suitable platform for flow field f \u2032(\u03b7) to move fast, as elaborated in Figure 6.

As we discussed in the velocity outlines, variation in the magnetic outcome causes a resistive force that falls out in the advancement of energy profile \u03b8(\u03b7). Similarly, the effect of the heat source/sink constraint also generated additional heat inside the fluid flow through all geometries (wedge, cone, and plate), which results in elevation of the temperature profile \u03b8(\u03b7).

Physically, the rising quantity of the nanoparticles (TiO2, CoFe2O4, and MgO) improved the viscosity of the trihybrid nanoliquid, which also improved the heat-absorbing capacity of the fluid; such a scenario was noticed in the energy field.

            "text": "The present analysis reported on the Darcy ternary hybrid nanofluid flow comprising of TiO2, CoFe2O4, and MgO NPs through a wedge, cone, and plate. A mathematical model was created with the objective to optimize the energy and mass transfer rates, and efficiency for a variety of commercial and medical functions. The phenomena were expressed as a nonlinear system of PDEs, which were reduced to a system of dimensionless ODEs through similarity replacement. The obtained set of differential equations was solved using the PCM technique. The following are the main findings from the above assessment:\n\u2022 The velocity field was dramatically reduced due to the influence of the magnetic field, the Darcy\u2013Forchheimer term, porosity term, and NPs volume fraction, while it was augmented with the positive variation of thermal Grashof number. \u2022 The heat energy profile was boosted under the effects of a magnetic field and heat source. \u2022 The addition of nanoparticles (TiO2, CoFe2O4 and MgO) to the water reduced the energy distribution. \u2022 The mass transfer \u03d5(\u03b7) profile was reduced with the upshot of the chemical reaction rate and Schmidt number, while it was boosted with the increment of activation energy. \u2022 The velocity and energy propagation rates over a cone surface were greater than those\nof the wedge and plate versus the variation in Grashof number, porosity effect, and heat source.\n\u2022 The mass transfer ratio under the impact of chemical reaction and activation over a wedge surface was higher than that of a plate. \u2022 The inclusion of ternary nanoparticles to the base fluid is significantly efficient for industrial and biomedical applications.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2419 14 of 16\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, I.U.; methodology, M.B.; software, M.B.; validation, I.U.; formal analysis, M.M.A.; resources, W.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.B. and W.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.M.G.; visualization, W.W.; supervision, I.U.
