            "text": "Titanium carbide (Ti3C2), the rst reported MXene, is synthesized by selective etching of the parent MAX phase of layered Ti3AlC2, which has attracted tremendous attention for various applications including energy storage and conversion, drug delivery and environmental remediation.1\u20136 Recent reports show that MXenes with excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity are promising materials in biochemistry elds, such as immunomodulation and tissue reconstruction,7,8 3D bioprinting,9,10 bioimaging,11 biosensing,11 and photothermal therapy.12\u201314 The etching process involves the surface modication of MXenes with functional groups \u2013OH, \u2013F, ]O, or \u2013Al(OH)4, resulting in enhanced photothermal properties.15,16 But the photothermal performance of Ti3C2 in the NIR window is still limited and further improvement is required.17,18 Therefore, it is of great signicance to modify Ti3C2 MXene with other functional materials, such as 2D nanosheets,19,20 to elevate its photothermal performance as well as expand its multi-functionality.\nng, Chongqing University of Technology,\nngzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, P. h@csu.edu.cn ectonics (MANA), National Institute for i 305-0044, Japan.

In recent years, more andmore research interest has been invested in exploring the biochemical applications of rare earthcontaining materials.26\u201328 However, biochemical research is mainly focused on rare-earth element-doped nanomaterials or quantum dots.27,29,30 Exploration and hybridization of 2D LREHs with other nanosheets are still blank. Recently, the successful exfoliation of LREHs into monolayer nanosheets has greatly expanded their application prospects as building blocks in nanolms and nanodevices.31,32 For example, through layer-bylayer assembly, superlattice structured lms constructed from LREH nanosheets and semiconducting oxide nanosheets exhibited enhanced photoluminescence through efficient energy transfer across the nanointerface.32,33 Among rare-earth elements, gadolinium and gadolinium-based compounds are widely used as photoluminescent hosts or matrices due to low phonon energy, suitability for coupling with other rare-earth ions, and low cost. Moreover, gadolinium compounds with the half-lled 4f orbitals of Gd3+, exhibit excellent magnetism properties making them ideal for use as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) contrast agents.34\u201337 Therefore, a layered gadolinium hydroxide (LGdH) nanosheet is selected to pair with a Ti3C2 nanosheet for enhanced photothermal and MRI properties.\nIn this work, unilaminar LGdH and Ti3C2 nanosheets were face-to-face restacked into a LGdH/Ti3C2 (GTC) hybrid, which exhibited enhanced NIR light absorption and MRI performance. This approach not only broadens the application of both MXenes and LREHs nanosheets toward biotherapy, but also provides a general strategy to design photothermal therapy and MRI contrast agent materials based on 2D nanomaterials.\nChem.

            "text": "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ti3AlC2 before and aer etching are shown in Fig. S1a and b.\u2020 Raw Ti3AlC2 swelled and split obviously aer etching. According to inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis, the Al/Ti atomic ratio was estimated to be 0.007 : 3 aer etching, verifying an almost complete removal of the Al atoms. Fig. S1c\u2020 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) prole of the raw Ti3AlC2 particles. The pattern matched well with the standard JCPDS card of the hexagonal Ti3AlC2 phase (No. 52-0875), indicating a high crystallinity and phase purity of the pristine crystals. Aer etching, the 00l peaks slightly shied to a lower degree, corresponding to an expanded interlayer distance from 1.84 nm to 2.05 nm. In addition, the broader full width at half maximum (FWHM) implied a decreased layer stacking order.\nFig. 1a and b show the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image and thickness prole of exfoliated Ti3C2 nanosheets, respectively. They were characterized by a typical thickness of approximately 1.5 nm, which is larger than a crystallographic unilamellar thickness of 0.75 nm,16 likely due to the adsorption of functional groups/ions (such as \u2013OH and \u2013F) and water molecules on the surface. Similarly, Fig. 1c and d show the AFM image and typical thickness of LGdH nanosheets, separately. The thickness was estimated to be approximately 1.0 nm, which is consistent with our previous report,31 indicating a monolayer feature. The lateral dimensions of both nanosheets fall in a range from several hundred nanometres to a fewmicrometres. The inset photographs of the suspensions in Fig. 1a and c display a homogeneous and stable dispersion state of the exfoliated nanosheets.\nA black occulated product was induced immediately with the dropwise addition of Ti3C2 nanosheets into the LGdH nanosheet suspension. As the Ti3C2 nanosheets held a negative charge with a zeta potential of \u221234.6 mV while their LGdH\n10796 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 10795\u201310799\ncounterparts were positively charged with a zeta potential of +57.3 mV, they underwent spontaneous restacking driven by the electrostatic attraction (see Fig. S2\u2020 for details). Fig. S3a\u2020 depicts the XRD pattern of the occulated product GTC. Both the characteristic in-plane diffraction peaks of LGdH and Ti3C2 were observed, conrming the intact feature of two oppositely charged nanosheets during the hybridizing process. Fig. 2a shows the transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) image of the resultant GTC hybrid, in which lamellar morphology was observed. The rings in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern are indexed to be in-plane reections of Ti3C2 nanosheets and LGdH nanosheets, respectively (Fig. 2b). The elemental mapping in Fig. 2c indicates a uniform distribution and intimate mixing of the two nanosheets in the GTC hybrid. The size of the GTC hybrid ranged from 50 to 500 nm according to the dynamic light scattering (DLS) results in Fig. S3b.\u2020 The\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It is noteworthy that occulated GTC hybrid can be well re-dispersed in deionized water, as evidenced by the inset of Fig. 2a. The small size and uniform dispersion features of the occulated product made it possible to be used in biomedicine elds such as MRI and photothermal therapy.\nFig. 3 compares UV-vis absorbance of Ti3C2 nanosheets and the GTC hybrid at various concentrations. For the convenience of comparison, all the concentrations were calibrated using the quantity of Ti3C2 in the suspensions. The concentrations of all samples in Fig. 3 are tabulated in Table S1.\u2020 As shown in Fig. 3a, for pure Ti3C2 nanosheet suspensions, the strong and broad absorption band ranging from 230 to 500 nm was attributed to the band-gap energy of the oxidized MXene.38 In addition, the weak broad absorption band centred at 715 nm in the NIR range from 600 to 830 nm was due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) caused by the inter-band transitions in MXene nanosheets.39 As an important parameter to evaluate the efficiency of light absorption, the mass extinction coefficient 3 at 808 nm can be calculated according to the Lambert\u2013Beer law:\nA = 3cl\nwhere A is the absorbance, 3 represents the absorption coefficient, c (g L\u22121) stands for the concentration of the samples and l (cm) is the absorption path length. Based on the plot shown in Fig. 3b, the 3 of Ti3C2 nanosheets was calculated to be 38.9 L g\u207b 1 cm\u207b1. This value was higher than those reported in the previous literature (Table S2\u2020).16,40 In the current work, the Al atomic\nFig. 4 Photothermal properties.

Some residual Li+ ions adsorbed on the surface of the Ti3C2 nanosheets,41 which was conrmed by the ICP result yielding a molar ratio of Ti : Al : Li at 94.28 : 0.23 : 5.49. Similar to Al or Au ion modied Ti3C2 MXene, the adsorption of Li+ ions may enhance the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect,18,40 resulting in an enhancement in NIR light absorption properties. As shown in Fig. 3c, for the GTC hybrid, the broad band in the NIR region red-shied to 780 nm and the absorption was extended to a wider wavelength range from 600 to 1000 nm. Compared to 38.9 L g\u207b1 cm\u207b1 for Ti3C2 nanosheets, the 3 value of the GTC hybrid increased to 50.0 L g\u207b1 cm\u207b1, the highest value among those of the reported NIR photothermal materials (Table S2\u2020). In contrast, the same amount of pure LGdH nanosheets showed negligible absorption in the NIR region (Fig. S4\u2020). The red-shi absorption and enhanced mass extinction coefficient of the GTC hybrid are believed to be a synergistic effect of hybridizing LGdH and Ti3C2 nanosheets on a molecular scale. The outstanding NIR absorption properties of the GTC hybrid promise their high photothermal performance.\nThe photothermal properties were evaluated under NIR laser exposure with a laser intensity of 2 W cm\u207b2. The concentration of a pure Ti3C2 suspension and LGdH suspension was 15.6 mg mL\u207b1. While for the GTC suspension, the contained Ti3C2 component was 15.6 mg mL\u207b1. As indicated by the IR thermographic images in Fig. S5,\u2020 the temperature of the GTC hybrid increased with an increasing concentration. Under 2 W cm\u207b2 irradiation for 10 min, the temperature surpassed 60.4 \u00b0C when\nting curves of the GTC hybrid, Ti3C2 nanosheets and LGdH nanosheets radiation (808 nm, 2 W cm\u207b2).\nChem.

For instance, for an elevated concentration of 15.6 mg mL\u207b1, the temperature of GTC drastically rose to 61.2 \u00b0C aer a short exposure of only 3 min, and nally reached 67.2 \u00b0C aer 10 min. In comparison, the temperature reached only 57.1 \u00b0C and 27.7 \u00b0C for pure Ti3C2 and LGdH nanosheets, respectively, as presented in Fig. 4. The result was well consistent with that of the UV-vis absorption analysis, in which the 3 value of the GTC hybrid was notably higher than that of Ti3C2 nanosheets, while the LGdH nanosheet exhibited negligible NIR absorption. The signicant temperature growth induced by the GTC hybrid indicated a higher photothermal capability than that by using sole Ti3C2 or LGdH nanosheets.\nThe performance of the GTC hybrid as a T1-weighted MRI contrast agent was evaluated by an in vitro assay experiment. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the contrast effect was enhanced with the increasing concentration of the GTC hybrid, while no signicant enhancement for individual Ti3C2 nanosheet and LGdH nanosheet suspensions was observed when compared with the control saline group. When the concentration reached 1.25 mg mL\u207b1, the T1-weighted signal exhibited obvious brightness compared with that of the control group, comparable to the frontier contrast agents such as clinical gadoteric acid meglumine salt injection.42 Fig. 5c depicts the in vivo contrast effect of both the GTC suspension (white arrow) and the control saline (grey arrow), from which a T1-weighted signal image was clearly presented. The signicant enhancement in both in vitro and in vivo tests implied a promising application of the GTC hybrid as an MRI agent."
