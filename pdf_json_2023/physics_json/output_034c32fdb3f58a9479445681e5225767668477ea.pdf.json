To access such information site-specifically, the signal assignment process is unavoidable. In the assignment process, C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 chemical shifts are of paramount importance in identifying the type of the amino acid residues. Conventionally, however, recording the C\u03b2 chemical shift of solid proteins with relatively short transverse relaxation time is often limited by the long delay required for the magnetization transfer to C\u03b2 spins and its evolution, i.e., by the sensitivity drop. In this paper, we propose a new method that encodes the C\u03b2 chemical shifts into the intensities of the scalar-coupled C\u03b1 signals, by combining an optimal-controlbased spin manipulation pulse and a spin-state filter. This reduced the total required transverse evolution to less than half of that for the previously proposed method, opening up the concept of the C\u03b2-encoding nearest-neighbor NMR, for the first time, to solid proteins. Also, the total measurement time was shorter than that required for the explicit C\u03b2 shift evolution. We demonstrate the sequential signal assignment for microcrystalline protein GB1, then discuss the prospects for more challenging proteins.",

            "text": "NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool being able to analyze protein structures, dynamics and interactions in near-native conditions such as in buffer solutions (liquid-state NMR)1, and in lipid bilayers2, supramolecular assemblies3 and phase-separated droplets4 (solid-state magic-angle spinning NMR or MAS NMR). To access such information site-specifically, one generally cannot avoid the signal assignment process. While it is labor-intensive and time-consuming, once the chemical shift value is determined for each atom, it already reveals a part of the structural and dynamics information, and provides an important basis for all the subsequent analyses.\nChemical shifts for C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 carbons are of particular importance because, with their relatively dispersed chemical shifts, they can serve as a \u201cfinger print\u201d in identifying the type of the amino acid residues. For solid-state NMR under a fast MAS condition, a protocol proposed by Pintacuda and co-workers is widely used5. They used the CANH and CAcoNH experiments to identify the C\u03b1 chemical shifts, and caCBcaNH and caCBcacoNH to identify the C\u03b2 chemical shifts, where the atom name with a lower case designates the one to which the coherence is transferred, but the chemical shift is not encoded. Despite fully functional, this protocol entails two limitations: the caCBcaNH and caCBcacoNH experiments require long spinechoes. The C\u03b2 chemical shifts are encoded by convering an inphase operator, C\u03b1!, to an anti-phase operator, 2C\u03b1\"C\u03b2#, which is then reconverted back into the in-phase state before detection. Assumign \ud835\udc3d$%$& is ~35 Hz, this interconversion requires ~29 ms (= 1/\ud835\udc3d$%$&) of the transverse evolution. This strongly limits its application to non-crystalline samples, e.g. membrane proteins in liposomes, with relatively short T2\u2019, suffering from the sensitivity drop. Another problem is that since the resonances are matched up using the H-N resonances for sequential signal\nassignment, degeneracy of the H-N resonances exponentially increases the complexity of the assignment process. Four-dimensional (4D) spectra, such as 4D-caCBCANH and caCBCAcoNH, would help reducing such complexity with a price of the lower sensitivity and increasing measurement time. Nonuniform sampling (NUS) and projection spectroscopy are of limited use for the low-sensitivity, peak-degenerated data often encountered in MAS NMR of solid proteins. Thus, methods that provide amino acid type information without implementing the 4D evolution is strongly preferable.\nRecently, the concept of \u201cnearest-neighbor NMR\u201d is proposed, that enables to guess the chemical shift range of the target spin by observing the scaler-coupled neighbor spin. This is accomplished without explicitly evolving the target spin, but instead by manipulating the spin-state of the target spins6,7. For instance, in the HNCA experiments, the C\u03b2 spin-states are flipped by band-selective inversion pulses applied at the center of the C\u03b1 evolution period. The splitting pattern of the observed C\u03b1 signal due to the \ud835\udc3d$%$& coupling depends on the C\u03b2 chemical shift and a particular design of the inversion pulse, enabling to guess the C\u03b2 frequency range. However, to clearly identify a doublet for '\ud835\udc3d$$ of ~35 Hz for aliphatic 13C spins, ~20 Hz resolution or ~50 ms evolution is required. Even for perdeuterated proteins under 60 kHz MAS or protonated proteins under ~100 kHz MAS, T2\u2019 for 13C\u03b1 is typically <30 ms8, thus this method is not generally useful for solid protein samples.\nHere, we propose an alternative approach that encodes the C\u03b2 chemical shifts as the signal intensity changes, instead of the splitting pattern, of the scalar-coupled C\u03b1 spins. This is accomplished by inserting a spin echo period and a z-filter just before the regular C\u03b1 evolution period. At the center of the echo period of the length 1/+2\ud835\udc3d$%$&,, an encoding pulse, as we call it the BE (C-Beta chemical shift Encoding) pulse, is applied, which\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-wm6ps ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-5674-2706 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

In this design, the echo block of only 1/+2\ud835\udc3d$%$&,, rather than a full 1/+\ud835\udc3d$%$&, period, is used to convert the C\u03b1 in-phase coherence to the anti-phase with respect to the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 scalar-coupling. Also, there is no need to resolve the J-splitting during the C\u03b1 evolution. Thus, the total transverse C\u03b1 evolution can be made well shorter than 20 ms, mitigating the T2\u2019 limitation. This opens up the concept of the nearest-neighbor encoding, for the first time, to solid proteins. Other previously reported spectral editing techniques that provide amino acid type information are based on DEPT9 or constant-time HSQC by '\ud835\udc3d$(10. Therefore, they are not applicable to perdeuterated protein samples. We demonstrate applicability of the BE-experiments under 70 kHz MAS condition to the signal assignment of a microcrystalline protein GB1. Applicability to membrane protein and larger crystalline protein are also discussed. The same method should be equally useful for solution NMR of large molecular-weight proteins."

            "text": "Principle of the method. The spin echo period with the BE pulse, or the BE-block, is illustrated in Figure 1. During the BE block under the 1H-decoupling, the chemical shift for 13C\u03b1 is refocused with the centrally placed BE pulse, while the scalarcouplings to its nearest-neighbor 15Namide, 13C\u2019 and 13C\u03b2 spins evolve only when these spins are simultaneously inverted. Thus, after the 1/+2\ud835\udc3d$%$&, BE period, the initial C\u03b1! state remains C\u03b1! when C\u03b2 spin experiences no inversion, but evolves into the antiphase 2C\u03b1!C\u03b2\" state when the C\u03b2 spin experiences an inversion (C\u2019 is always not inverted). The following z-filter\npasses the former but not the latter term for subsequent observation, and thus the C\u03b2 inversion is encoded as the C\u03b1 signal intensity. For example, if the BE pulse inverts the C\u03b2\" state only within the chemical shifts range of [25, 35] ppm, the C\u03b1 signal coupled with C\u03b2 resonating within this particular inversion window vanishes.\nMore specifically, the BE pulse must achieve the following: (1) Refocus the transverse C\u03b1 spins (\ud835\udc3c! \u2192 \ud835\udc3c! , \ud835\udc3c# \u2192 \u2212\ud835\udc3c# , \ud835\udc3c\" \u2192 \u2212\ud835\udc3c\"), (2) Invert the longitudinal C\u03b2 spins within the inversion window (\ud835\udc3c\" \u2192 \u2212\ud835\udc3c\"), (3) Keep the C\u03b2 spins outside the inversion window intact (\ud835\udc3c\" \u2192 \ud835\udc3c\"), and (4) Keep the C\u2019 spins always intact, where the spin operator \ud835\udc3c designates an arbitrary 13C spin. This rather elaborate spin manipulation is achieved with a single BE pulse designed by the OC theory.\nThe inversion profiles for the C\u03b2 spins were designed based on the chemical shifts statistics found in Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB)11, illustrated in Figure 2. The amino acid residues except for Cys, Ser and Thr residue are divided into three groups: Group A= amino acids at around 40 ppm; Group B = those at around 32 ppm; and Ala whose C\u03b2 has the unique chemical shifts at ~19 ppm, being isolated from the other residues. There are gaps at around 35 ppm between the Group A and B, and at 25 ppm between Group B and Ala, which we chosen as the borderlines for the BE inversion profiles. Accordingly, we have developed following three BE pulses with specific C\u03b2 inversion window: BE-1 that inverts C\u03b2z below 35 ppm to identify Group A, BE-2 that inverts C\u03b2z above 35 ppm to identify Group B and Ala, and BE-3 that inverts C\u03b2z between 25 and 35 ppm to exclude Group B.\nThe BE pulse length was set to 2 ms; it is composed of a series of 2 \u00b5s rectangular pulses, and optimized for obtaining a steep edge profile of the selective C\u03b2 inversion. The phase and intensity of each element pulse were optimized by the GRAPE algorithm12 as described in the supporting information, and the obtained pulse shapes are illustrated in Figure S1. The C\u03b2 chemical shifts of Ser and Thr residues (> 60 ppm) overlap with the C\u03b1 chemical shift range, and always inverted in the above design, thus they are supposed to be invisible in the BE-experiments. Cys C\u03b2 chemical shifts are strongly affected by the disulfide bond formation, and are not considered in this method.\nGroup A Group B A\nR N\nD Q\nE H\nI L\nK M\nF P W\nY V\n\u00b9\u00b3C\u03b2 chemical shi. / ppm\n15202530354045\nFigure 2.

License: CC BY 4.0\nThe cost we pay for implementing the BE approach is the measurement time for the four 3D experiments (reference data and data with BE-1/2/3 pulse), which is the same time to measure two complex points when the C\u03b2 chemical shift is explicitly evolved. It is impossible to discriminate the amino acid groups defined above from the two points measurement. Thus, the cost is tolerated when the explicit C\u03b2 chemical shift encoding or the 4D measurements are prohibitive.\nFirst of all, we checked the designed BE pulses in simulation. Figure 3 shows the inversion profiles simulated for \ud835\udc3c!, \ud835\udc3c# and \ud835\udc3c\" using the BE-1/2/3 pulses. It can be seen in the C\u03b1 region ([50, 80] ppm), the \ud835\udc3c! magnetizations are intact while the \ud835\udc3c# and \ud835\udc3c\" magnetizations are inverted, being equivalent to an \ud835\udc65 -phase 180\u00b0 pulse for C\u03b1 spins. The C\u2019 longitudinal magnetization always remains intact, allowing to avoid the C\u03b1-C\u2019 scalar-couplings to disturb the \ud835\udc36\ud835\udefc! \u2192 2\ud835\udc36\ud835\udefc#\ud835\udc36\ud835\udefd\" transition of interest. Finally, it can be seen that the \ud835\udc3c\" inversion profiles in the C\u03b2 region conforms to the above design. While we designed the BE1/2/3 pulses for the use at B0 = 16.4 T (1H Larmor frequency of 700 MHz), a simple scaling of the RF power and pulse duration maintains the inversion profiles for the use at other field conditions (Figure S2).\nNext, we experimentally validated the BE-block incorporating the BE-1/2/3 pulse using a powder mixture of uniformly 13C, 15N labeled L-Ala, L-Leu (Group A) and L-Val (Group B), and the pulse sequence in Figure 4a. The length of the BE-block 2\ud835\udf0f)\nwas set to 16 ms to minimize the Ala and Val C\u03b1 signals with the BE-1 pulse. For a convenience in the subsequent analysis and discussion, we here define a three-digits binary code, or BE-code, indicating the signal appearance (1) or disappearance (0) in the spectra incorporating the BE-1, -2, and -3 pulses in this order. Thus, each amino acid group is expressed in the BEcode as following: Group A: [101], Group B: [010], Ala: [011], Ser / Thr: [000]. Figure 5 clearly demonstrates that the C\u03b1 signal disappears only when its neighboring C\u03b2 spin is inverted: the Leu C\u03b1 signal is seen with the BE-1 and BE-3 pulses, while it is absent with the BE-2 pulse, expressed as [101] in the BEcode. Similarly, the Ala and Val C\u03b1 signals have the [011] and [010] pattern, respectively, as intended.\nBE-code identification test on protein GB1. Now, we demonstrate the use of the BE-experiment for the signal assignment of uniformly 13C, 15N labeled microcrystalline GB1. First, we compare in Figure 6 the representative HN-C\u03b1 slices, taken at \u03b4N = 125.9 ppm (a-d) and = 115.9 ppm (e-h) from the 3DCANH data. The leftmost panels show the conventional CANH data for reference, and those on the right show the BE-1/2/3CANH data recorded with the pulse sequence shown in Figure 4b,c. In the former slice (at \u03b4N = 125.9 ppm), Q2, L5, I6, L7, E19, A20, W43 and W46 signals are to be observed\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-wm6ps ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-5674-2706 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

The codes were correct, except for Q2 and E19 (shown in bold), for which [010] is correct for Group B. These errors are easily spotted out as the code [110] is invalid by design. Although the C\u03b2 chemical shift for Q2 and E19 (29.9 and 30.7 ppm, respectively) are well within the inversion window of the BE-1 pulse, the signal appeared in the spectrum incorrectly. Considering the fact that the signal for V21, whose C\u03b2 chemical shift (31.9 ppm) is also within the BE-1 inversion window, was correctly eliminated (Figure 6f), the error cannot be attributed to a malfunction of the BE-1 pulse, and thus attributed to the deviation of \ud835\udc3d$%$& values for Q2 and E19 from the typical value. Even so, since the peak in the BE-1 data for these residues were much smaller than that in the BE-2 data, an intensity thresholding easily retrieve the correct code [010]. The one-bond \ud835\udc3d$%$& couplings in proteins with typical fold is reported to distribute with a standard deviation of ~2.5 Hz13, i.e. 95% of the cases fall within \u00b15 Hz window around the typical value. Our calculation showed that this 10 Hz fluctuation in J coupling causes small false positive peak in the BE-1 inversion window of the magnitude ~0.2 or less, relative to the intensity in the BE-2 data (Figure S3). Considering the imperfect edge profiles for the Cb spin inversion as well, a threshold at the onethird (~0.33) of the tallest peak in the BE-1/2/3 dataset typically provides a good result.\nIn the latter slice taken at \u03b4N = 115.9 ppm (Figure 6e-h), T16, T18, V21, E27 are to be conventionally observed. The read BEcode, [000], [000], [010], [110] were mostly correct; the error for E27 (shown in bold) can be corrected as [010] by the thresholding.\nThe Thr residues are supposed to be absent in all the BE-experiments (i.e., the BE-code of [000]) and the signals for T16, T18 and T25 were indeed missing in all the BE spectra. This null code [000] is unique to Ser and Thr residues, thus can provide a good starting point for the sequential assignment. Otherwise, Val and Pro are only residues in Group B (for [010]) whose average C\u03b1 chemical shifts in BMRB is >60 ppm. Since in the 1Hamide-detection experiments Pro residues will not be detected, the downfield-shifted C\u03b1 with the BE-code of [010] can be identified as Val with high possibility. Similarly, Ile is the only residue whose average C\u03b1 chemical shift is >60 ppm in Group A (for [101]), and Ala is unique with the code of [011]. All these residues (Ser, Thr, Val, Ile and Ala) can serve as a good starting point for the sequential assignments.\nFigure 7 compiles the read-out and expected BE-codes for all residues of GB1 except M1, which was missing in the conventional CANH. A judicious choice of intensity threshold for small peaks (shown with a horizontal dotted line) reduces the incorrect BE-code assignment. One must be careful with Gly that appears as if Group B ([010]) while it has no sidechain. This is because only the BE-2 pulse refocuses the 13Ca spins for Gly with \u03b4Ca >45 ppm (See Figure. 3b). Because the BE-code for K4 and A23 could not be identified due to the signal overlap to each other in the BE-CANH spectrum, they should be read in the BE-CAcoNH data (Figure S4) recorded using the pulse sequence shown in Figure 4b,d. Overall, 53 out of 55 residues were identified with the correct BE-code. The only two failed residues (K4 and K13) were incorrectly identified as Group A (for [101]) instead of Group B (for [010]). Actually, these two Lys residues had the C\u03b2 chemical shift strongly downfield shifted (35.9 and 38.3 ppm, respectively), being well outside the standard deviation in the BMRB statistics for Lys, and step well into the C\u03b2 shift range of Group A. This is possibly because the F,Y and c1 dihedral angles for K4 and K13, major influencing factors for the C\u03b2 secondary shifts14, are in the less occurring region, being quite isolated from those of the other Lys residues (Figure S5). Thus, we conclude these errors were due to the abnormal secondary chemical shifts of K4 and K13 from their particular conformation. This is highlighting the limitation of the present method.\nThe same BE-code identification can be implemented or double-checked using the BE-CAcoNH data recorded using the pulse sequence shown in Figure 4b, d. The CA-C\u2019 transfer was implemented by J-based INEPT-like manner15, which yielded higher transfer efficiency than the dipolar coupling-based transfer using BSH-CP16. Figure S4 presents the read-out BE-codes derived from the BE-CAcoNH experiments, with theresult largely consistent with that given by BE-CANH, except for K4, K13 and K28. The errors for the K4 and K13 are discussed above. That for K28 is probably related to its C\u03b2 chemical shift (32.6 ppm), which is near the edge of the BE-1 inversion profile, although this error did not happen for the BE-CANH data. As mentioned above, the error is readily identified as the code [110] is invalid, and since the BE-3 data clearly has no signal for K28, the correct code [010] can be deduced. The present method is more prone to give a false positive since the peak\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-wm6ps ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-5674-2706 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0\nelimination relies on the perfect spin inversion, thus the unobserved peak provides stronger evidence in reading the BE-code. Similar logic is to be incorporated when automating the BEcode assignment procedure that will be described below. The error from the imperfect edge profile can be addressed by improving the OC design for a steeper cutoff profile. The generation of such pulses remains a subject for future investigation.\nSequential signal assignment of the GB1. In Figure 8, we show an example of the sequential walk for the A26EKV29 segment of GB1 (the superscripts show the residue number). We chose the CANH peak at [\u03b4C\u03b1, \u03b4N, \u03b4H] = [66.3, 117.8, 7.47] ppm as the starting point (Figure 8b). This peak with the BE-code of [010] and \u03b4C\u03b1 >60 ppm can readily be assigned to valine residue as described above. In the cognate slice taken from the BECAcoNH at \u03b4N = 117.7 ppm, we identified a residue with the BE-code of [010] for Group B. While GB1 has four valine residues, AV21, KV29, GV39 and TV54, only lysine residue is to give the BE-code of [010], and thus the chosen peak is uniquely assigned to KV29. It follows that the C\u03b1 chemical shift found in the BE-CAcoNH slice is for Lys28. To go on a step farther, we now look for a C\u03b1 peak matching to this K28 C\u03b1 peak in other CANH slices. As is seen in Figure 8b, we found two candidate slices. To find out which is the correct one, we see again its cognate BE-CAcoNH spectra and look for the BE-code of [010] for Glu27 (Group B). The CAcoNH slice taken at \u03b4N = 116.2 ppm showed the BE-code of [010], while that at \u03b4N = 120.1 ppm showed [101], thus the former is assigned to EK28 (the other slice was later assigned to FK31 with Phe in Group A for [101]). This process can be repeated as long as possible. Figure 8c shows the walk for one more step down to A26EK28. The C\u03b1 peak of Glu27 matched three CANH slices, but only one of them taken at \u03b4N = 115.7 ppm had the cognate CAcoNH slice\ncorrectly exhibiting the code of [011] for Ala. The other slices were later assigned to K10 and Q32.\nThis workflow can be fully automated. Here, we combine information from the BE-CANH and BE-CAcoNH data with an assignment algorithm FLYA17. The BE-experiment results were treated as results from amino-acid selective labeling samples. The detailed protocol is given in the supporting information. Figure 9 compares the assignment result obtained in this way (Figure 9a) with that obtained when the amino acids type assignment is determined only by the C\u03b1 chemical shift statistics (Figure 9b). In the former case, 162 out of 166 chemical shifts were correctly assigned, while without using the BE-code information, only 91 chemical shifts were correctly assigned (Figure 9b). The four wrong assignments given in the BE-experiments were attributed to the encoding failure of K4, K13 and K28, as these errors were cleared by manually correcting their BE-codes. Notably, in the former case, all correctly assigned chemical shifts were categorized to \u201cconsolidated\u201d which means 80 % of the results for the repeated runs are consistent. While in the latter case, only 27 correct chemical shifts were categorized to \"consolidated\". Thus, the residue type information derived from the BE-experiments is critical for the reliable signal assignments.\nTo evaluate the efficiency of the present method for more challenging proteins, we emulated the assignment process using synthesized spectra based on the reported chemical shifts and the linewidth, and partly the chemical shifts simulated from the atomic coordinates; detailed procedure is given in the supporting information. We investigated two representative proteins:\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-wm6ps ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-5674-2706 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0\nProteorhodopsin (PR), a membrane protein with highly degenerated amino acid type and Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) as an example of large molecular-weight protein (~42 kDa). For PR, we found that 47.7 % of the shifts for all the Hamide, Namide and C\u03b1 were correctly assigned with the same protocol shown above for GB1 (Table S4 and Figure S7). The rate of correct assignment is limited by the C\u03b1 chemical shift degeneration (Figure S9). However, adding only one peak list generated from the hNcocaNH data improved the success rate to 92.3 %. The latter data can be readily acquired for T2-limited samples using dipolar coupling based C\u03b1/C\u2019 magnetization transfer18,19, and proposed as a part of the default dataset. When the conventional CANH/CAcoNH data are combined with hNcocaNH, the rate of correct assignment remained 60.6 %. These results indicate\nthat the residue type information derived from the BECANH/CAcoNH experiments is critical for a successful sequential assignment. For MBP, the success rate was 77.9 % using the proposed three datasets, and the introduction of the BEexperiments improved the rate similarly to the case for PR (Table S3 and Figure S8, S10). Thus, our proposed BE-experiments can provide a powerful basis for the challenging proteins.\nFurther improvement of the BE-pulses\u2019 performance. Although the S/N observed for the BE-CANH data was about 20\u221250% of that for the conventional CANH, it was still, on average, ~1.3 times higher than that for the caCBcaNH (Figure S6,\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-wm6ps ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-5674-2706 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

The observed S/N is, however, roughly a factor of 2\u22123 lower than expected, if no magnetization loss is happening during the BE pulse, considering the fact that the total transverse evolution\ntime for the BE-CANH is shorter by 10 ms than that for caCBcaNH, and T2\u2019 for GB1 C\u03b1 spin is ~10 ms.

License: CC BY 4.0\nignoring the influence of many other factors e.g., the dipolar and scaler couplings, the chemical shift anisotropy and the sample spinning, the RF interference from the other channels in addition to the spin relaxation. To see how much these factors affect the magnetization loss during the BE-block, we carried out SpinEvolution20 simulations, and compared the results on a simple 2-spin system involving only the C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 spins with a scalar coupling to those with an 8-spin system including 1H, 13C, 15N spins with all the relevant dipolar and scalar couplings. The details of the simulations are described in SI. The result showed that in the 8-spin system, a factor of 1.7\u22122.5 loss of the magnetization was observed as compared with the 2-spin system (Figure S11). Thus, the loss of S/N observed in experiment is most likely due to the suboptimal design of the BE pulse, which can be improved in exchange with the computational cost.\nOther applications. The BE block can be incorporated into any pulse sequences involving the magnetization transfer through the C\u03b1 spins. For example, the hNCAHA and hNcoCAHA experiments previously used for backbone and sidechain assignments under >90 kHz MAS condition are the possibilities. Considering the fact that Ca T2\u2019 of fully protonated PR in proteoliposomes, one of the most challenging targets, was reported to be ~13 ms under 100 kHz MAS21, being even longer than that for GB1 as measured in this study, we anticipate the utility of the BE-experiment for a wide range of similar membrane protein targets. The BE experiments do not necessarily\nneed the C\u03b1 chemical shift to be evolved. It has been recently shown that the HNcocaNH and HNcacoNH experiments with their five-dimensional derivatives are the powerful means for the large protein sequential assignments18,22. The BE-block can be added to them to obtain the C\u03b2 chemical shift information even for T2\u2019-limited systems.\nThe BE-block reduces the number of peaks. This property can partly lift the signal congestion in large systems, and systems with a high degeneracy of the amino acid type, such as membrane proteins. As another example, the relaxation measurement needs a series of high-dimensional experiments with a good signal separation for accurate peak intensity quantification, and it is strongly time-consuming. The 15N-1H type experiments are frequently used to quickly characterize the protein backbone dynamics, but suffers from the signal congestion. The caNH type BE experiments can be used to simplify the H-N resonances. In case of Bacteriorhodopsin, a typical membrane protein, ~40% of the amino acid are hydrophobic or aromatic such as Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, and Trp. The BE block with the BE2 pulse eliminates 34% of these signals corresponding to Leu, Ile, Phe, and Tyr, without any sample modifications. The resultant spectral sparseness is also favorable for NUS. Thus, the BEexperiments help accomplishing the rapid and accurate relaxation measurements. These abilities should also prove useful for the analysis of large proteins in solution."

            "text": "The C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 chemical shifts are critical for the protein backbone resonance assignment. Here, we proposed a new approach that encodes the information of the C\u03b2 chemical shift onto the signal intensity of its scalar-coupled C\u03b1 peak, rather than its J-splitting pattern. This allows to shorten the total transverse evolution time and opened the concept of the nearest neighbor NMR to systems with relatively short T2\u2019, including solid proteins and large molecular-weight proteins in solution. The encoding is achieved by inserting a spin-echo period with a refocusing pulse designed by the optimal control theory, which we dubbed the BE-block, just before the C\u03b1 evolution period. In this study, the BE-block were embedded into 3DCANH and CAcoNH experiments, the minimum set of sequences for the sequential assignment, and validated for the sequential assignment of microcrystalline protein GB1. Without any user-intervention, an automated protocol correctly assigned 53 out of 55 residues using the BE-experiment and automated signal assignment program FLYA. Applications to more challenging proteins, Proteorhodopsin and Maltose Binding Protein, were also investigated, and we proposed a minimal dataset for a reasonable assignment success rate when combined with the present BE-experiments.\nOptimal control theory and related approaches have been pushing up the capabilities of NMR spectroscopy23,24. In this study, the optimal control pulses are at the heart of the BE-pulse, whose design is quite difficult with other means. However, some technical limitations e.g., the computational costs and issues related to the local optima in the optimization protocol, remain. Further developments in these regards are required, that, we believe, will further embolden its opportunity in the advanced protein NMR spectroscopy in the future."

Numpy25 and Scipy26 packages were used for the linear-algebra operations, and Baysian Optimization package (https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization) was used for updating of the pulse shapes combined with GRAPE algorithm12. The spin dynamics simulations, except for the calculations in Further improvement of the BE-pulses\u2019 performance, were performed using home-written Python scripts. In Further improvement of the BE-pulses\u2019 performance, SpinEvolution20 was used.\nSample preparation. Uniformly 13C, 15N L-alanine, L-leucine, and L-valine were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. Uniformly 13C, 15N labeled GB1-T2Q, F52Y mutant (referred to as GB1) was expressed, purified and micro-crystallized following a previously described protocol except paramagnetic labeling and its related steps27. Those samples were packed into JEOL 1.0 mm MAS rotors.\nMAS solid-state NMR experiments. All the NMR measurements were performed on a 16.4 T magnet with the JEOL HCN 1.0 mm MAS probe and a JEOL ECA-II spectrometer. The MAS rate was kept at 70 kHz throughout. For the GB1 measurements, the cooling gas at \u221240 \u00b0C was used to maintain the sample temperature ambient, and it was estimated to be ~20 \u00b0C from the T1 relaxation time of K79Br on the same MAS and sample cooling condition28. The 13C chemical shifts were referenced using the L-alanine 13C\u2019 signal at 179.778 ppm (DSS scale). 1H and 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to DSS and liquid ammonia, respectively29,30. The carrier for 13C were set to 55, 175 ppm for C\u03b1 and C\u2019, respectively. The 15N carrier was set to 120 ppm. The 1H carrier was set to 5 ppm for the amino acid mixture measurements, and on a bulk water signal (~5 ppm) for the GB1 measurements. The 90\u00b0 pulse width of 1H, 13C, and 15N was 1.3, 1.2, and 3.2 \u00b5s, respectively. For 1H to 13C / 15N CP and the inverse CP were carried out by DOTA-CP31 with single quantum condition, whose effective 1H RF field strength was ~110 kHz and 13C / 15N RF field was ~40 kHz. 13C to 15N CP were carried out by double quantum (DQ) CP whose Hartman-Hahn matching condition of ~50 kHz for 15N and ~20 kHz for 13C. In both CP magnetization transfers, linear-ramp gradient was used. In DOTA-CP, the gradient was applied to the 13C or 15N channels. In DQ CP, that was applied to the 13C channel. The matching condition and gradient were experimentally optimized. The Ca-C\u2019 magnetization transfer was caried out by an INEPT-like manner15. The spin echo durations \ud835\udeff! and \ud835\udeff\" in Figure 4d for the transfer were experimentally optimized. The solvent suppression was performed by MISSISSIPPI without the homospoil gradient pulse32. The RF strength of MISSISSIPPI was ~10 kHz. 1H and 15N decouplings were performed by ~10 KHz of rCWApA33 and ~20 kHz of WALTZ-1634, respectively. The recycle delay was set to 0.8 s. The data sampling parameters were summarized in Table S1.\nData processing were done by JEOL Delta software for 1D data and NMRPipe35 for otherwise. The exponential and Lorentz-to-Gauss window functions were applied to the 1D and 3D data, respectively, prior to the zero-filling and Fourier transformation. Spectral analyses were performed by NMRFAM-Sparky36 and POKY37. The resonance assignments of GB1 were taken from BMRB 15156 and adapted using CANH, CAcoNH and caCBcaNH spectra (Table S5). The spectra were visualized by Python with Nmrglue38 and Matplotlib packages39."
