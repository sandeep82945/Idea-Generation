The corresponding conjugate curve network is projectively invariant and is characterized by the existence of particular transformations. We study properties of that transformation theory and illustrate how several known surface classes appear within our framework. We present cone-nets in the classical smooth setting of differential geometry as well as in the context of a consistent discretization with counterparts to all relevant statements and notions of the smooth setting. We direct special emphasis towards smooth and discrete tractrix surfaces which are characterized as principal cone-nets with constant geodesic curvature along one family of parameter curves.

            "text": "Consider a surface and an arbitrary curve on that surface which is not an asymptotic curve. The set of all tangent planes along that surface envelops a generic developable surface. The focus of our paper lies in the investigation of surface parametrizations such that the enveloping developables of one family of parameter curves are not generic developable surfaces but merely cones. Therefore we use the name cone-nets for our parametrizations. Note that our cone-nets are not to be confused with the so called conical nets which are discrete nets with planar faces such that at each vertex the adjacent faces around that vertex are in tangential contact with a cone of revolution [1].\nThe study of our cone-nets has been motivated by the fabrication idea of cladding surfaces with developable strips. The aspects of cladding surfaces with general developable surfaces\u2014not necessarily just cones\u2014have also been investigated in the context of approximating surfaces, for example in [2,3] in a non-parametrized way, or in the theory of curved crease paper folding (see, e.g., [4]).\nMoreover, strip-models of surfaces have been investigated in different contexts. For example strip-models have been used to develop a better understanding of classical smooth differential geometry by replacing smooth surfaces with discrete surfaces. R. Sauer has systematically started to study these discrete counterparts to gain a better understanding of the classical smooth setting [5\u20137]. By introducing this methodology he laid the ground for the now highly active research field of discrete differential geometry (see, e.g., [8]) to which the second part of the present paper can be counted. In particular R. Sauer\u2019s investigation of surfaces of revolution [5,6] which he approximated by a collection of cones of revolution can be seen as a first example of a much bigger class of surfaces which are now called semi-discrete surfaces. These surfaces have a smooth and a discrete coordinate direction and are therefore particularly interesting in the context of cladding surfaces from developable strips with the view towards applications [1] but have also led to a new concept in differential geometry [9]. The results of the present paper could be transferred to the semi-discrete setting, but we will refrain from that as our focus lies on the smooth and the purely discrete setting.\nCone-nets form a particular subclass of surface parametrizations namely so called conjugate nets. Conjugate nets have extensively been studied in the nineteenth and twentieth century [10]. Within that class of nets the K\u0153nigs nets (see, e.g., [8]) form a subclass which are characterized by the existence of transformations. We develop a similar characterization of our cone-nets by the existence of so called conical Combescure transformations.\nOur cone-nets include and generalize some known surface parametrizations. For example cladding surfaces with strips of just cylinders (instead of cones in our case) has been studied in [11,12]. They are considering foliations of surfaces with \u201cplanar geodesics\u201d whereas our cone-nets parametrize \u201cspherical curves of constant geodesic curvature\u201d. From the application point of view the special case of cylinders plays an important role. For example, there are industrial glass tempering and bending machines for manufacturing hot and even cold bent glass in the shapes of cylinders. The even more special case of approximating surfaces with just right circular cylinders has been mentioned in [13]. Another example are the discrete canal surfaces in [14] which appear as a special case of our definition of discrete canal surfaces. One further example are the multi-Q-nets [15] which appear in our context as so called double cone-nets. The projective dual of our cone-nets, i.e., networks on surfaces with planar cuves have been studied with a view towards applications in [16]. More\ninvestigation in practical methods for the (computational) design of cone-nets will be addressed in a forthcoming paper.\nOur paper consists of two corresponding sections where we develop the smooth theory in Sect. 2 which we then discretize in Sect. 3 by following discretization principles as understood in [8]."

            "text": "An important role in our paper play developable surfaces. A surface is called developable if it is (locally) isometric to the plane, or equivalently, if the Gauss curvature vanishes identically (see e.g., [17]). Developable surfaces devide into three categories: cylinders, cones, and tangent surface.\nDevelopable surfaces are ruled surfaces and can therefore be parameterized in the form\nd(s, t) = c(t) + se(t),\nwhere c : R \u2283 I \u2192 R3 is called directrix and e : R \u2283 I \u2192 R3 \\ {0} is the ruling direction.\nThe rulings of a tangent surface are the tangent lines of a space curve. This curve is called the curve of regression and consists of the singular points of the tangent surface.\nThe tangent planes along each ruling of a developable surface are identical. In other words, the direction of the normals of d do not depend on s. Consequently, ds\u00d7dt = e\u00d7(ct+set) points in the same direction independently of s if and only if\ndet(e, et, ct) = 0. (1)\nWe say that the developable surface is enveloped by its tangent planes. And also vice versa any generic (and smooth enough) one-parameter family of planes envelopes a developable surface [17].\nThe envelope of the tangent planes along a curve on a surface is the developable surface which is enveloped by the tangent planes along that curve. That envelope degenerates if the curve is an asymptotic curve on the surface.\nThe focus of our investigation lies primarily in local properties of sufficiently smooth curves and surfaces. We can always assume our surfaces to be parameterized by f : R2 \u2283 U \u2192 R3.\nWe will be working a lot with so called conjugate nets which form a particular class of nets in projective differential geometry but can easily be described in terms of classical differential geometry.\nDefinition 1. A parameterization f : R2 \u2283 U \u2192 R3 is called conjugate or a conjugate net if in each point the mixed partial derivative is parallel to the tangent plane (or vanishes), i.e., there exist a, b : U \u2192 R such that fuv = afu + bfv.\nConjugate nets are also characterized by the following well known lemma where we consider the envelope of the tangent planes along the u-parameter curves (i.e., isolines with fixed parameter v) of a smooth net f(u, v).\nLemma 1. For any fixed v the ruled surface parameterized by (see Fig. 1 left)\n(s, u) \u2192 T (s, u, v) := f(u, v) + sfv(u, v) is developable if and only if f is a conjugate net.\nProof. Developability of T is equivalent to the vanishing determinant (cf. Eq. (1))\ndet(fv, fuv, fu) = 0,\nwhich is equivalent to f being conjugate.\nWe will denote the one-parameter family of envelopes of tangent planes by T (s, u, v)."

We call a net, i.e., a parameterization of a surface, cone-net if all envelopes of tangent planes along all u-parameter curves (or all v-parameter curves) are cones or cylinders. The net is called a proper cone-net if all envelopes of tangent planes along all u-parameter curves (or all v-parameter curves) are cones with a proper cone tip.\nIf not stated otherwise, we will always assume that the tangential cones are in contact with the surface along the u-parameter curves of cone-nets. In projective geometry cones and cylinders are indistinguishable and since projective transformations keep tangential contact between surfaces we obtain that cone-nets are invariant under projective transformations.\nLemma 2. A conjugate net with fuv = afu + bfv is a cone-net, with tangential cones along u-parameter curves, if and only if ab = au and a cone-net, with tangential cylinders along u-parameter curves, if and only if a = 0.\nProof. We start with the cylinders. A cylinder is tangent to a u-parameter curve of a conjugate net if and only if the partial derivatives fv are parallel along that curve. This is the case if and only if\n0 = \u2202u fv \u2016fv\u2016 = \u2016fv\u2016fuv \u2212 fv\u2202u\u2016fv\u2016\n\u2016fv\u20162 , which is equivalent to fuv = bfv, i.e., if and only if a = 0. Let us now assume that the envelope of tangent planes is not a cylinder, i.e., a = 0. The curve of regression r consists of the singular points of that envelope T . It is characterized by those parameters s where Tu \u00d7 Ts = 0. Hence, from\n0 = Tu \u00d7 Ts = (fu + sfuv) \u00d7 fv = fu \u00d7 fv + safu \u00d7 fv we get s = \u2212 1a and consequently r(u, v) = T (\u2212 1a(u,v) , u, v) = f(u, v) \u2212\n1 a(u,v)fv(u, v) as curve of regression for each fixed v. However, the envelope of the tangent planes for any fixed v is not just an arbitrary tangent surface. It is a cone which means that the curve of regression degenerates to a point\u2014it does not depend on u. Therefore, it is a cone if ru = 0, hence,\n0 = ru = (au\na2 \u2212 b a\n) fv\nand consequently ab = au.\nFrom this proof we conclude that the curve of tips of the enveloping cones is parameterized by\nr(v) := f \u2212 fv a . (2)\nAny surface can be parameterized, at least locally, by a cone-net. A possible generation of such a net can be explained with a simple geometric construction which, for a special case, was already known to Bo\u0308klen [18]. Consider a point light in space (the point can also be a point at infinity) which sheds light onto the surface (cf. Fig. 1 left). The light cone consisting of rays connecting the point light with the silhouette is a tangential cone in our sense. Moving the point light along a curve yields a one-parameter family of silhouettes which form u-parameter curves of a cone-net. Bo\u0308klen [18, 10. on p. 69] describes the construction of that special case where the curve of point lights is a straight line."

            "text": "There are some well known and commonly used surface parameterizations which are also cone-nets.\nExample 1. The typical parameterizations of surfaces of revolution with meridian curves and parallel circles are cone-nets in both directions. The tangential cones along the parallel circles are rotationally symmetric and have their cone\ntips on the axis of revolution. The tangential cones along all meridian curves are cylinders.\nExample 2. Canal surfaces are surfaces enveloped by a one-parameter family of spheres. These spheres are in tangential contact with the canal surface along a circle which constitute one family of curvature lines. Along these circles we have cones of revolution in tangential contact with the canal surface along these circles. Therefore, curvature line parameterizations (or principal nets) of canal surfaces are cone-nets. Surfaces of revolution, Dupin cyclides, and tubular surfaces (canal surface with constant radius spheres) are special canal surfaces. We will revisit canal surfaces in the context of principal nets in Sect. 2.5.2.\nExample 3. Translational surfaces f are generated as the sum of two curves g and h:\nf(u, v) := g(u) + h(v).\nThere are cylinders in tangential contact along both parameter curves. Translational surfaces are therefore cone-nets. Any projective transformation of a translational surface generates a double cone-net (see also Sect. 2.4) whose curves of cone tips lie in a plane which is the image of the plane at infinity.\nExample 4. Any suitable smooth enough family of planes intersects a quadric in a smooth family of conics. The envelope of tangent planes along such a conic is a cone whose vertex is the projective pole of the plane with respect to the quadric. These poles form the curve r of cone tips. The directions of the rulings of the cones are conjugate to the tangents of the conics.\nExample 5. A tractrix curve is the locus of the endpoint of a stick dragging behind while the other end moves along a straight line. A generalization of that idea is moving one end along an arbitrary space curve r instead of a straight line, see Fig. 1 (center). With this method we can obtain a - what we call - generalized tractrix surface if we drag each point of a space curve \u03b3 (Fig. 1 right) along another space curve r. In this way each parameter line is a generalized tractrix curve. We will revisit (generalized) tractrix surfaces in Sect. 2.5.1. As a special case the curve \u03b3 can lie in its initial position on a sphere with center on the base curve r. We refer to them as tractrix surfaces since all \u201csticks\u201d are of the same length. In that case the foliation of parameter curves that is traced out by draging \u03b3 consists of curves with constant geodesic curvature. The net of parameter curves on a tractrix surface generated this way generalizes the nets from [11,12]. They are considering foliations of surfaces with planar geodesics. So the analogy is \u201cplanar geodesics\u201d vs. \u201cspherical curves of constant geodesic curvature\u201d.\nExample 6. T-surfaces are conjugate nets with planar coordinate curves such that the two families of planes that carry the curves intersect each other orthogonally (see, e.g., [7,19,20]). Up to a Euclidean motion every T-surface f can be constructed by a one-parameter family of two-dimensional affine transformations \u03b1v and a curve c(u) = (x(u), 0, z(u)) in the xz-plane such that\nf(u, v) = ( \u03b1v ( x(u) 0 ) z(u) ) ,\ni.e., every vertical profile curve of f is constructed from c by a non-uniform scaling (just in x-direction) and a rotation around a z-parallel axis. See Fig. 2 (left) for a discrete T-surface. Special sub-classes of T-surfaces are surfaces of revolution and translational surfaces. The tangent planes along a vertical profile curve of a T-surface envelope a cylinder with horizontal rulings. Projective transformations of Tsurfaces are cone-nets with all cone tips on a straight line which is the image of the line at infinity (see Fig. 2 right)."

            "heading": "2.3. Transformation of Cone-Nets",
            "text": "A classical topic in differential geometry is the transformation of surfaces [8, 10]. A particular focus lies on the transformation of conjugate nets. In this section we introduce a transformation for cone-nets. Thereby, a cone-net is transformed to a parallel cone-net in the following sense.\nDefinition 3. Two nets f, f\u2217 : R2 \u2283 U \u2192 R3 are said to be parallel or related by a Combescure transformation, if at each point corresponding partial derivative vectors are parallel, i.e., fu \u2016 f\u2217u and fv \u2016 f\u2217v . The net f\u2217 is called Combescure transform of f and vice versa.\nTheorem 3. Let f : U \u2192 R3 be a conjugate net with fuv = afu + bfv, for some a, b : U \u2192 R, where a = 0. Furthermore, let \u03bb : U \u2192 R be a function only depending on v, i.e., \u03bbu = 0. Then for all such \u03bb there exists a Combesure transform f\u2217 with\nf\u2217u = \u03bbfu and f \u2217 v = ( \u03bb +\n\u03bbv a\n) fv\nif and only if f is a proper cone-net. Furthermore, f\u2217 is a proper cone-net as well and has the following form up to translation\nf\u2217 = \u03bbf \u2212 \u222b\n\u03bbv\n( f \u2212 fv\na\n) dv = \u03bbf \u2212 \u222b \u03bbvr dv.\nProof. The net f\u2217 exists if and only if the integrability condition (f\u2217u)v = (f \u2217 v )u holds. We have\n(f\u2217u)v = (f \u2217 v )u\n\u21d4 \u03bbvfu + \u03bbfuv = ( \u03bbu +\n\u03bbuva \u2212 \u03bbvau a2\n) fv + ( \u03bb +\n\u03bbv a\n) fuv\n\u21d4 \u03bbvfu + \u03bb(afu + bfv) = \u2212\u03bbvau a2\nfv + ( \u03bb +\n\u03bbv a\n) (afu + bfv)\n\u21d4 (\u03bbvau\na2 \u2212 \u03bbvb a\n) fv = 0,\nbecause \u03bbu = \u03bbuv = 0. Since the last equation must hold for any \u03bb, it is equivalent to ab = au. Consequently, the existence of f\u2217 is equivalent to f being a cone-net.\nAfter setting a\u2217 := \u03bbv+a\u03bb\u03bb and b \u2217 := \u03bbau\u03bbv+a\u03bb we obtain f \u2217 uv = a \u2217f\u2217u + b \u2217f\u2217v .\nTo show that f\u2217 is also a cone-net we must verify that b\u2217 = a \u2217 u\na\u2217 . We have\na\u2217u a\u2217 = [(\u03bbuv + au\u03bb + a\u03bbu)\u03bb \u2212 (\u03bbv + a\u03bb)\u03bbu]\u03bb \u03bb2(\u03bbv + a\u03bb) = \u03bbau \u03bbv + a\u03bb = b\u2217.\nTo obtain the expression for f\u2217 we have to integrate f\u2217u = \u03bbfu and f \u2217 v =(\n\u03bb + \u03bbva ) fv. Since \u03bb does not depend on u, integration of f\u2217u by u yields\nf\u2217 = \u03bbf + c(v)\nwith some function c(v). Differentiating this equation by v yields\nf\u2217v = \u03bbvf + \u03bbfv + cv.\nComparing this with the definition of f\u2217v implies\nc(v) = \u2212 \u222b\n\u03bbv\n( f \u2212 fv\na\n) dv= \u2212 \u222b \u03bbvr dv,\nwhich is indeed independent of u and yields the integral representation of f\u2217.\nDefinition 4. We call the Combescure transformations from Theorem 3 which map cone-nets to cone-nets conical Combescure transformations or CCT for short. For a given cone-net f and a non-zero function \u03bb we denote the conical Combescure transform by C\u03bb(f). Lemma 4. The set of transformations {C\u03bb | \u03bb non-zero function} is a commutative group with respect to composition. The inverse of C\u03bb is given by C 1\n\u03bb and\nthe neutral element is the identity map C1. Proof. The group operation is the composition of maps, hence, we have to show\nC\u03bc(C\u03bb(f)) = C\u03bb\u03bc(f) for all non-zero functions \u03bb, \u03bc. Since a Combescure transformation determines the transformed surface only up to a translation, we consider the derivatives:\nC\u03bc(C\u03bb(f))u = \u03bb\u03bcfu = C\u03bb\u03bc(f)u C\u03bc(C\u03bb(f))v = ( \u03bc +\n\u03bcv a\u2217\n) f\u2217v = ( \u03bc + \u03bcv \u03bbv+a\u03bb\n\u03bb\n)( \u03bb +\n\u03bbv a\n) fv\n= ( \u03bb\u03bc +\n(\u03bb\u03bc)v a\n) fv = C\u03bb\u03bc(f)v,\nwhich is what we wanted to show.\nFrom Eq. (2) we know that the tips of the enveloping cones lie on the curve r(v) = f \u2212 fva . The curve of the tips of a CCT of f can be computed from r and \u03bb.\nLemma 5. After a CCT the curve of tips of the one-parameter family of enveloping cones becomes up to translation\nr\u2217(v) := \u222b \u03bbrv dv. (3)\nThe line segments, connecting the enveloped surface f with the curve r are scaled by \u03bb, i.e., r\u2217(v) \u2212 f\u2217(u, v) = \u03bb(v) \u00b7 (r(v) \u2212 f(u, v)). Proof. By the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 2 the curve of the cone tips corresponding to f\u2217 is given by\nr\u2217(v) = f\u2217 \u2212 f \u2217 v\na\u2217 = \u03bbf \u2212\n\u222b \u03bbv ( f \u2212 fv\na\n) dv \u2212 \u03bb\n\u03bbv + a\u03bb\n( \u03bb +\n\u03bbv a\n) fv\n= \u03bb ( f \u2212 fv\na\n) \u2212 \u222b \u03bbv ( f \u2212 fv\na\n) dv = \u03bbr \u2212 \u222b \u03bbvr dv = \u222b \u03bbrv dv.\nFor the line segments generating the cones we obtain\nf\u2217 \u2212 r\u2217 = f \u2217 v\na\u2217 =\n\u03bb\n\u03bbv + a\u03bb\n( \u03bb +\n\u03bbv a\n) fv = \u03bb\nfv a = \u03bb(f \u2212 r), which concludes the proof.\nCorollary 6. Conical Combescure transformations have the following properties:\n(i) Corresponding u-parameter curves of a cone-net f and its CCT f\u2217 are related by a homothety.\n(ii) For constant \u03bb \u2208 R \\ {0} the corresponding CCT acts on the net as similarity with scaling factor \u03bb, i.e., C\u03bb(f) = \u03bbf up to translation.\n(iii) CCTs are preserving angles between parameter curves at corresponding points (since all Combescure tranformations preserve parallelity between tangents in corresponding points). (iv) If f is a principal net (i.e., conjugate and orthogonal), than for any \u03bb the corresponding CCT f\u2217 is also a principal net.\nEven though cone-nets are projectively invariant, CCTs do not commute with projective transformations. However, affine transformations \u03b1 do commute with CCTs:\nf C\u03bb\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 f\u2217\n\u03b1 \u23d0\u23d0 \u23d0\u23d0 \u03b1 \u03b1(f)\nC\u03bb\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b1(f\u2217) The reason why projective transformations do not commute with CCTs\nis that in contrast to affine transformations the change of direction of straight lines depends on its location in space. Consider, for example, a projective transformation \u03ba that maps a plane \u03b5 to infinity. We can choose f with a curve of proper cone tips r in R3 which does not intersect \u03b5, but such that the\ncurve of cone tips r\u2217 of C\u03bb(f) does intersect \u03b5. Then \u03ba\u25e6f only contains proper cones whereas \u03ba \u25e6C\u03bb(f) contains tangential cylinders which we can not get rid of by any CCT."

The existence of a tangential cone is assumed only for one family (usually along u-parameter curves). However, it poses an interesting question which nets are cone-nets in both directions.\nDefinition 5. We call a net a double cone-net, if all envelopes of tangent planes along both families of parameter curves are cones or cylinders.\nWith Lemma 2, a conjugate net f : U \u2192 R3 is a double cone-net if and only if the functions a, b defined by\nfuv = afu + bfv\nsatisfy\nbv = au = ab. (4)\nIn the following theorem we will show that double cone-nets are so called K\u0153nigs nets which constitute themselves a special subclass of conjugate nets.\nDefinition 6. A net f : U \u2192 R3 is called a K\u0153nigs net if there exists z : U \u2192 R + such that (see, e.g., [8]):\nfuv = (log z)vfu + (log z)ufv.\nIt is immediately clear from this definition that K\u0153nigs nets are conjugate nets.\nTheorem 7. Let U \u2282 R2 be a simply connected domain and let f : U \u2192 R3 be a conjugate net which is a cone-net w.r.t. the u-parameter curves. Then the net f is a double cone-net if and only if f is a K\u0153nigs net.\nProof. Let us assume f is a K\u0153nigs net and a cone-net w.r.t. the u-parameter curves. From the K\u0153nigs net property we get\nfuv = (log z)vfu + (log z)ufv,\nfor some z : U \u2192 R+. By setting a := (log z)v and b := (log z)u the theorem of Schwarz implies au = bv. Since f is a cone-net w.r.t. the u-parameter curves and by Lemma 2, we further have\nab = au = bv\nwhich implies that f is a double cone-net (cf. Eq. (4)). Now, let us assume that f is a double cone-net. Therefore, a, b satisfy\nab = au = bv.\nLet us define a vector field c : U \u2192 R2 by setting c := (b, a). On the simply connected domain U , the vector field c has a potential p : U \u2192 R with grad p = (pu, pv) = c if and only if the rotation of c is zero. This is the case for double cone-nets since\nrot(c) = \u2202c2 \u2202u \u2212 \u2202c1 \u2202v = au \u2212 bv = ab \u2212 ab = 0.

The geodesic curvature of a curve on a surface measures the curvature of the curve projected into the tangent plane. We obtain the geodesic curvature for the u-parameter curves by\nkug = \u3008fu \u00d7 fuu, N\u3009 \u2016fu\u20163 (5) = \u03ba \u03b1 and analogously kvg = \u03b7 \u03b2 ,\nfor the v-parameter curves.

Let f be a principal net. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) The net f is a cone-net. (ii) The geodesic curvature of the u-parameter curves (or v-parameter curves)\nis constant for each curve. (iii) The u-parameter curves (or v-parameter curves) are spherical or planar\nand these spheres or planes intersect the surface orthogonally.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii): If the net is a cone-net along the u-parameter curves, then Lemma 2 implies au = ab. Differentiating Eq. (11) yields\nau = (\u2212\u03b2\u03ba\n\u03b1 ) u = \u2212\u03b2u \u03ba \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 (\u03ba \u03b1 ) u\n= ab \u2212 \u03b2(kug )u, which implies that the geodesic curvature is constant. (ii) \u21d2 (iii): If the constant geodesic curvature of a u-parameter curve of a principle cone-net is non-zero, then the function\nr(v) := f \u2212 fv a = f + \u03b1 \u03ba Y = f + 1 kug Y, (12)\nis independent of u, i.e.\nru = fu + \u03b1\n\u03ba Yu\n(5) = \u03b1X \u2212 \u03b1\n\u03ba \u03baX = 0.\nHence the u-curve is contained in a sphere S(v) (see below). If the geodesic curvature vanishes, i.e., kug = 0, then \u03ba = 0 and Eq. (5) implies Yu = 0. Therefore, the v-derivative vectors along any such u-parameter curve have the same direction fv(u, v) = \u03b2(u, v)Y (v), and define a cylinder. In this case, the u-curve is contained in a plane S(v). Consequently, we set\nS(v) := { {x \u2208 R3 | \u2016x \u2212 r(v)\u20162 = (kug )\u22122} if kug = 0, {x \u2208 R3 | \u3008x \u2212 f(u0, v), Y (v)\u3009 = 0} for some u0 if kug = 0.\n(iii) \u21d2 (i): If a u-parameter curve lies on a sphere which intersects f orthogonally, then the tangents of the v-parameter curves along this u-parameter curve must pass through the center of the sphere (since fu \u22a5 fv for principal nets). The argument for u-parameter curves being planar works analogously.\nDefinition 7. We call the spheres or planes S(v) geodesic curvature spheres.\nRemark 1. (Cauchy data for principle cone-nets) The v-parameter curves of a principle cone-net f are orthogonal trajectories of the geodesic curvature spheres S(v). In particular, any principle cone-net is uniquely determined by its geodesic curvature spheres S(v) and a spherical curve \u03b3(u) \u2208 S(v0). Lemma 9. The property of a net being a principle cone-net is invariant under Mo\u0308bius transformations.\nProof. Mo\u0308bius transformations map principle nets to principle nets (see, e.g., [8]). Further, Mo\u0308bius transformations map spheres and planes to spheres or planes. Lemma 8 implies that principle nets are cone-nets if and only if they have one family of spherical parameter curves whose spheres intersect the surface orthogonally. Consequently, Mo\u0308bius transformations map principle conenets to principle cone-nets.\n2.5.1. Tractrix Surfaces. Given a curve \u03b3 : R \u2283 I \u2192 R3 and a space curve r : R \u2283 J \u2192 R3, we can define a surface f : U \u2192 R3 with U = I \u00d7J by solving an initial value problem for every fixed u:\nf(u, v0) = \u03b3(u) v0 \u2208 J, fv(u, v)\n\u2016fv(u, v)\u2016 = f(u, v) \u2212 r(v) \u2016f(u, v) \u2212 r(v)\u2016 .\nIf the curve r(v) is a straight line, then the solution for any u of the above differential equation is the well known tractrix. If furthermore, the initial curve is a circle in a plane orthogonal to that straight line, then the surface is the pseudosphere. For arbitrary curves \u03b3 and r we call the resulting surface a generalized tractrix surface. If \u03b3 is a curve on a sphere with its center on the base curve r, we call it simply tractrix surface since all v-parameter lines are tractrices with the same \u201cstick\u201d length. The following lemma is an immediate consequence of the definition.\nLemma 10. Every tractrix surface consists of orthogonal trajectories of a oneparameter family of spheres with constant radii.\nLemma 11. Let f : U \u2192 R3 be a principal cone-net. Then a CCT with parameter \u03bb maps f to a principal cone-net f\u2217. The geodesic curvatures of the u-parameter curves of the related surfaces f and f\u2217 satisfy\n|ku \u2217g | = |kug | |\u03bb| .\nProof. Let f : U \u2192 R3 be a principal cone-net and f\u2217 its conical Combescure transform, i.e.,\nf\u2217u = \u03bbfu = \u03bb\u03b1X = \u03b1 \u2217X\u2217 and f\u2217v = ( \u03bb +\n\u03bbv a\n) fv = ( \u03bb +\n\u03bbv a\n) \u03b2Y = \u03b2\u2217Y \u2217.\nSince the tangents of the two nets are parallel at corresponding points, the frame X\u2217, Y \u2217, N\u2217 of f\u2217 is parallel to the frame of f . Since the functions \u03b7, \u03ba, c and d only depend on the frame, they do not change under the CCT up to a possible sign change. Therefore, f\u2217 is a principle net if and only if f is a principal net (which we already saw in Corollary 6(iv)) and the absolute value of the geodesic curvature of the u-parameter curves is given by\n|ku \u2217g | = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03ba \u2217\n\u03b1\u2217 \u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03ba \u03bb\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223k u g \u03bb \u2223\u2223\u2223. which is what we wanted to show.\nCorollary 12. A net is a principal cone-net with non-vanishing geodesic curvature if and only if it is a CCT of a tractrix surface.\n2.5.2. Canal Surfaces. Canal surfaces are surfaces enveloped by a one-parameter family of spheres\n{x \u2208 R3 | \u2016x \u2212 m(v)\u20162 = R2(v)}. These spheres are in tangential contact with the canal surface along circles which constitute one family of curvature lines. These so called generating circles are given by the intersection of the above spheres with the planes\n{x \u2208 R3 | \u3008x \u2212 m(v),\u2212mv(v)\u3009 = Rv(v)R(v)}. Hence the centers of the circles and their radii are given by\nc(v) := m(v) \u2212 Rv(v)R(v)\u2016mv(v)\u20162 mv(v), \u03c1(v) := R(v) \u2016mv(v)\u2016 \u221a \u2016mv(v)\u20162 \u2212 Rv(v)2.\nAlong these circles there are cones of revolution in tangential contact with the surface. The curve of cone tips can be computed by using simple trigonometry (see Fig. 3)\nr(v) = m(v) \u2212 R(v) Rv(v) mv(v).\nThe principle curvature of the circular curvature lines is given by \u03ba1 = \u2212 c\u03b1 = R(v)\u22121. It is well known that a surface is a canal surface if and only if one of the principle curvatures is constant along its curvature line. Surfaces of revolution, Dupin cyclides, and tubular surfaces (canal surface with constant radius spheres) are special canal surfaces.\nTheorem 13. A principal cone-net f : U \u2192 R3 is a canal surface if and only if its Gauss map N : U \u2192 S2 is a cone-net. Proof. We compute the mixed derivative of the Gauss map, using the frame equations (5)\u2013(10):\nNuv = \u2212cvX \u2212 c\u03b7Y = cv c Nu + c\u03b7 d Nv = \u03bad c Nu + du d Nv,\ntherefore,\nNuv = a\u0303Nu + b\u0303Nv, where a\u0303 := \u03bad\nc = cv c and b\u0303 := c\u03b7 d = du d .\nThe Gauss map is a cone-net if and only if a\u0303u = a\u0303b\u0303. We have\na\u0303u = \u03baud + \u03badu c \u2212 \u03badcu c2 = a\u0303 (\u03bau \u03ba \u2212 cu c ) + a\u0303b\u0303.\nTherefore, the Gauss map is a cone-net if and only if \u03bau\u03ba = cu c . Since we assumed that f is a principle cone-net, the geodesic curvature of the u-parameter curves is constant: (\u03ba\n\u03b1 ) u = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 (\u03bau \u03ba = \u03b1u \u03b1 or \u03ba = 0 ) .\nHence the principle curvature \u03ba1 = c\u03b1 is constant along the u-parameter curves and f is a canal surface if and only if N is a cone-net. Lemma 14. The Gaussian image of any principal net of a canal surface is its CCT for \u03bb = \u03ba1 = \u2212 c\u03b1 , which is the principle curvature of the generating circles. Further, any CCT of a canal surface is again a canal surface.\nProof. For any principle net the formula of Rodrigues (see, e.g., [17]) implies that the partial derivatives of the Gauss map and the surface are parallel, i.e.,\nNu = \u03ba1fu = \u2212 c \u03b1 fu, Nv = \u03ba2fv = \u2212 d \u03b2 fv.\nIf f is a canal surface, one of the principle curvatures is constant along its curvature line. We assume 0 = (\u03ba1)u = \u2212( c\u03b1 )u. Under the CCT with function \u03ba1 the u-derivative changes according to\nC\u03ba1(f)u = \u2212 c\n\u03b1 fu = \u03ba1fu = Nu.\nFor a principle cone-net we further have a = \u03b1v\u03b1 (see Eq. (11)). For the vderivative we obtain\nC\u03ba1(f)v = ( \u03ba1 +\n(\u03ba1)v a\n) fv = ( \u2212 c\n\u03b1 +\n( \u2212 cv\n\u03b1 +\n\u03b1vc\n\u03b12 ) \u03b1 \u03b1v ) fv\n= \u2212 cv \u03b1v fv (6)(9) = \u2212 d \u03b2 fv = Nv,\nand therefore C\u03ba1(f) = N . For the second part of the proof note that parallel related surfaces have the same Gauss map. Therefore, the Gauss map of every CCT of a canal surface is a cone-net and the transformed surface is a canal surface.\nThe offset surface fd := f + d N , for d \u2208 R of a canal surface is a canal surface itself where the corresponding spheres have the same centers as for f but radii R(v) + d (see Fig. 3). Since any surface and its offset surfaces have the same normals, we can use Lemma 14 to obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 15. Let f be a canal surface and \u03ba1(v) the principle curvature of the generating circles. The offset fd is up to translation a CCT of f for \u03bb = 1+d \u03ba1\nDarboux proved in [21] that a principle net, whose coordinate curves have constant geodesic curvature, is Mo\u0308bius equivalent to a surface of revolution, cone or cylinder. With Lemma 8 this implies the following theorem of which an independent proof in our framework can be found in the appendix.\nTheorem 16. (Darboux [21]) Every double principal cone-net is Mo\u0308bius equivalent to a surface of revolution, cone or cylinder.\nAn immediate consequence of Theorem 16 is Vessiot\u2019s Theorem.\nTheorem 17. (Vessiot [22]) Away from umbilical points every isothermic canal surface is locally Mo\u0308bius equivalent to a surface of revolution, cone or cylinder.\nProof. Away from umbilical points canal surfaces admit a cone-net parameterization. If this net is isothermic, i.e., a principle K\u0153nigs net, it is a double cone-net and we can apply Theorem 16 which concludes the proof."

Definition 8. A quadrilateral net is called conjugate if all quadrilaterals qij are planar (see, e.g., [8]).\nIn complete analogy to the smooth case, conjugate nets are characterized by the property that the mixed derivative lies in the span of the partial derivatives (cf. [8]):\nLemma 18. A quadrilateral net is conjugate if and only if there exist functions a, b : U \u2192 R such that\n\u03b4i\u03b4jfij = aij\u03b4ifij + bij\u03b4jfij .\nSince \u03b4i\u03b4jfij = \u03b4ifi,j+1 \u2212 \u03b4ifij = \u03b4jfi+1,j \u2212 \u03b4jfij , we immediately obtain \u03b4jfi+1,j = aij\u03b4ifij + (bij + 1)\u03b4jfij (13)\n\u03b4ifi,j+1 = (aij + 1)\u03b4ifij + bij\u03b4jfij (14)\nwhich we will use later. We will denote the quadrilaterals by\nqij := (fij , fi+1,j , fi+1,j+1, fi,j+1), (15)\nand for every j we define the horizontal strip Bj := {qij | (i, j) \u2208 U} and for every i the vertical strip Bi := {qij | (i, j) \u2208 U}, see Fig. 4 (left). Let Lij denote the straight line that contains the edge fijfi,j+1, i.e.,\nLij = fij + R\u03b4jfij .\nIf all lines Lij are concurrent for all i and a fixed j, they generate a (discrete) cone (i.e., a pyramid) Tj . The parameter curves i \u2192 fij =: \u03b3j(i) lie on the cones Tj and Tj\u22121. The cone tip of the cone Tj is denoted by rj .\nDefinition 9. A discrete conjugate net f : U \u2282 Z2 \u2192 R3 is called a cone-net if all horizontal or all vertical strips are contained in a discrete cone or cylinder. The net is called a proper cone-net if each horizontal or each vertical strip is contained in a proper cone with a proper cone tip. See Fig. 4 (left) for an illustration.\nIf not stated otherwise, we will always assume, that the horizontal strips Bj of a discrete cone-net are contained in a cone. The following lemma is a discrete analogue of Lemma 2.\nLemma 19. A conjugate net f : U \u2282 Z2 \u2192 R3 is a cone-net with discrete cones along horizontal strips if and only if the functions a, b : U \u2192 R defined in Lemma 18 satisfy\nbij = aij \u2212 ai\u22121,j\nai\u22121,j = aij ai\u22121,j \u2212 1,\nand a cone-net with discrete cylinders along horizontal strips if and only if aij = 0. If the surface is a cone-net, then the tips of the cones are given by\nrj = fij \u2212 1 ai\u22121,j \u03b4jfij = fij \u2212 bij + 1 aij \u03b4jfij . (16)\nProof. Note that the horizontal strip Bj lies on a cylinder if and only if the edge vectors \u03b4jfij are parallel for all i. Equation (13) implies that this is the case if and only if aij = 0 for all i. Suppose now the horizontal strips lie on proper cones. Consider the lines Lij . The surface is conjugate if and only if Lij and Li+1,j intersect each other in a point rij for all (i, j) \u2208 U . We compute this intersection point rij using Eq. (13)\nfij + t\u03b4jfij = fi+1,j + s\u03b4jfi+1,j \u21d4 \u2212\u03b4ifij + t\u03b4jfij = s(aij\u03b4ifij + (bij + 1)\u03b4jfij) \u21d4 0 = (1 + saij)\u03b4ifij + (s(bij + 1) \u2212 t)\u03b4jfij \u21d4 s = \u2212 1\naij and t = \u2212bij + 1 aij .\nThe intersection point rij is therefore given by:\nrij = fij \u2212 bij + 1 aij \u03b4jfij = fi+1,j \u2212 1 aij \u03b4jfi+1,j .\nThe surface is a cone-net if rij is independent of i, i.e., rij = ri+1,j for all i. Consequently, in that case we have\nfi+1,j \u2212 1 aij \u03b4jfi+1,j = rij = ri+1,j = fi+1,j \u2212 bi+1,j + 1 ai+1,j \u03b4jfi+1,j ,\nand therefore\nbi+1,j = ai+1,j aij \u2212 1 for all i,\nwhich concludes the proof.\nRemark 2. For a quadrilateral qij = (fij , fi+1,j , fi+1,j+1, fi,j+1) of a conjugate net f , the Laplace points are defined as the intersection points of opposite edges (see Fig. 4 right), i.e.,\nL1ij := (fij \u2228 fi+1,j) \u2229 (fi,j+1 \u2228 fi+1,j+1), L2ij := (fij \u2228 fi,j+1) \u2229 (fi+1,j \u2228 fi+1,j+1).\nThe Laplace points define (possibly degenerate) conjugate nets themselves which are called the Laplace transforms of f (see, e.g., [8]). Since opposite edges might be parallel, these nets are not necessarily contained in R3 but in the projective space P(R3), i.e., Lk : Z2 \u2192 P(R3). Note that the net f is a cone-net if and only if one Laplace transform degenerates to a polygon."

            "text": "Several aspects of the classical theory on transformations of surfaces have been discretized (see e.g., [23]). Hereby, the transformation of discrete conjugate nets plays a prominent role. We add to that theory the characterization of discrete cone-nets via a discrete transformation theory. Our transformations of discrete nets behave analogously to their smooth counterparts.\nDefinition 10. Two discrete conjugate nets f, f\u2217 : Z2 \u2283 U \u2192 R3 are said to be parallel or related by a Combescure transformation, if for all (i, j) \u2208 U corresponding edge vectors are parallel, i.e., \u03b4ifij \u2016 \u03b4if\u2217ij and \u03b4jfij \u2016 \u03b4jf\u2217ij . Each of them is called Combescure transform of the other. A Combescure transformation is called a cone-net, if the transformation of a discrete conenet is a cone-net.\nThe following theorem about discrete cone-nets preserving Combescure transformations is a discrete analogue of Theorem 3 (see also Fig. 5 left and center).\nTheorem 20.

Then f is a cone-net if and only if for every such function \u03bb there exists a Combescure transform f\u2217 : U \u2192 R3 of f with:\n\u03b4if \u2217 ij = \u03bbj\u03b4ifij , \u03b4jf \u2217 ij = ( \u03bbj+1 +\n\u03bbj+1 \u2212 \u03bbj ai\u22121,j\n) \u03b4jfij .

This equivalence is a simple consequence of Desargue\u2019s theorem. Desargues\u2019 theorem (see Fig. 6 right) says that two triangles \u0394(a | b | c),\u0394(a\u2032 | b\u2032 | c\u2032) are centrally perspective (i.e., the three lines aa\u2032, bb\u2032, cc\u2032 are concurrent) if and only if they are axially perspective (i.e., the three points (ab \u2229 a\u2032b\u2032), (bc \u2229 b\u2032c\u2032), (ca \u2229 c\u2032a\u2032) are collinear). We will apply Desargues\u2019 theorem a couple of times to show the following two theorems which discretize Theorem 7.\nTheorem 22. Every double cone-net is a K\u0153nigs net.\nProof. It is sufficient to consider a 2 \u00d7 2-subpatch of the net (see Fig. 6 left). We have to show that the three lines from Eq. (19) are concurrent. To do so we will apply Desargues\u2019 theorem four times:\n[ \u0394(fi+1,j | fi,j\u22121 | fi\u22121,j) \u0394(fi+1,j\u22121 | fij | fi\u22121,j\u22121) ] centrally perspective\n=\u21d2 the two lines fi+1,jfi\u22121,j , fi+1,j\u22121fi\u22121,j\u22121 meet the line mi+1,j\u22121mi\u22121,j\u22121 in a point zi[\n\u0394(fi+1,j | fij | fi\u22121,j) \u0394(fi+1,j\u22121 | fi,j\u22121 | fi\u22121,j\u22121) ] centrally perspective =\u21d2 the line ri\u22121ri also passes\nthrough zi[ \u0394(fi+1,j | fij | fi\u22121,j) \u0394(fi+1,j+1 | fi,j+1 | fi\u22121,j+1) ] centrally perspective =\u21d2 the line fi+1,j+1fi\u22121,j+1 also passes through zi[\n\u0394(fi+1,j | fi,j+1 | fi\u22121,j) \u0394(fi+1,j+1 | fij | fi\u22121,j+1) ] centrally perspective =\u21d2 the line mijmi\u22121,j , also passes\nthrough zi Consequently, the three lines from Eq. (19) are concurrent.\nThe converse result holds only in a slightly modified version as we must assume at least one vertical strip to be contained in a cone. There exist K\u0153nigs nets with horizontal strips being cones but which are not double cone-nets. For such an example see Fig. 5 (right).\nTheorem 23. A K\u0153nigs cone-net with horizontal strips being cones is a double cone-net if and only if at least one vertical strip is contained in a cone.\nProof. It is sufficient to consider a 2 \u00d7 2-subpatch of the net (see Fig. 7). We assume the two horizontal strips Bj and Bj\u22121 to be cones with centers rj and rj\u22121 and the \u201cleft\u201d vertical strip Bi\u22121 to be a cone with center ri\u22121.

For that we apply Desargues\u2019 theorem six times (see Fig. 7 for a reference of notation):[ \u0394(mij | fi+1,j | fi+1,j+1) \u0394(mi\u22121,j | fi\u22121,j | fi\u22121,j+1) ] axially perspective =\u21d2 zi, fi+1,j+1, fi\u22121,j+1 collinear[\n\u0394(mi,j\u22121 | fi+1,j\u22121 | fi+1,j) \u0394(mi\u22121,j\u22121 | fi\u22121,j\u22121 | fi\u22121,j) ] axially perspective =\u21d2 zi, fi+1,j\u22121, fi\u22121,j\u22121\ncollinear[ \u0394(mi\u22121,j | fi\u22121,j+1 | fi,j+1) \u0394(mi\u22121,j\u22121 | fi\u22121,j\u22121 | fi,j\u22121) ] axially perspective =\u21d2 yj , fi\u22121,j+1, fi\u22121,j\u22121 collinear[ \u0394(rj | fi,j+1 | fi\u22121,j+1) \u0394(rj\u22121 | fi,j\u22121 | fi\u22121,j\u22121) ] axially perspective =\u21d2 yj , rj , rj\u22121 collinear[\n\u0394(rj | fi+1,j+1 | fi\u22121,j+1) \u0394(rj\u22121 | fi+1,j\u22121 | fi\u22121,j\u22121) ] axially perspective =\u21d2 yj , fi+1,j+1, fi+1,j\u22121 collinear[\n\u0394(fij | fi+1,j+1 | fi+1,j\u22121) \u0394(fi+1,j | fi,j+1 | fi,j\u22121) ] axially perspective =\u21d2centr. perspective with center ri\nTherefore, the \u201cright\u201d vertical strip Bi is a cone.\nRemark 3. An alternative proof of the last theorem in a projective setup using Laplace invariants follows ideas presented in [8]. The Laplace invariants are\ngiven as cross-ratios of four collinear points (for the definition of the Laplace points Lk see Remark 2):\nhij := cr(fij ,L1ij ,L1i,j\u22121, fi+1,j), kij := cr(fij ,L2ij ,L2i\u22121,j , fi,j+1). The net is a cone-net if one of the families of Laplace points degenerates to a polygon, i.e., L1ij = L1i,j\u22121 for all j, or equivalently, if one of the Laplace invariants has constant value 1, i.e., hij = 1. The cross-ratio is well defined for projective lines and invariant under projective transformations. Therefore, this definition for cone-nets works as well for nets in P(R3). For more information on projective differential geometry and Laplace invariants see [24]. Also K\u0153nigs nets can be characterized in terms of Laplace invariants. For a discrete K\u0153nigs net the Laplace invariants satisfy\nhijhi\u22121,j = kijki,j\u22121, (20)\nfor all i, j which can be found for instance in [8]. If a K\u0153nigs net is a cone-net in the horizontal direction, i.e., hij = 1 and has also one vertical cone-strip (e.g., k0,j = 1), then Eq. (20) implies that the net is a double cone-net.\nRemark 4. (Cauchy data for double cone-nets) Any double cone-net over a rectangular domain is uniquely determined by any two cone-strips Bi0 and Bj0 .\nDouble cone-nets have also been investigated in the framework of so called multi-nets [15].\nDefinition 13. A discrete conjugate net f : Z2 \u2283 U \u2192 R3, is called a multi Qnet, if for every i0 = i1 and j0 = j1 the quadrilateral (fi0,j0 , fi1,j0 , fi1,j1 , fi0,j1) is planar. The net f is called multi-circular if the quadrilaterals (fi0,j0 , fi1,j0 , fi1,j1 , fi0,j1) have circumcircles (see also Lemma 37).\nBobenko et al. [15, Th. 2.4] show that a net is a double cone-net if and only if it is a multi Q-net."

            "text": "A common discretization of principal nets are nets with Z2 combinatorics such that every face has a circumcircle [8]. The following definition is not to be confused with so called conical nets in [1,8] which also discretize principal nets.\nDefinition 14. A discrete principal cone-net is a discrete cone-net with concyclic faces, i.e., fij , fi+1,j , fi+1,j+1, fi,j+1 is a concyclic quadrilateral for all i, j with circumcirle Cij , and the edges fij \u2228 fi,j+1 pass through a common point rj , for all i. If no point rj is a point at infinity, we call the principle cone-net proper.\nCorollary 24. Discrete conical Combescure transformations map principal conenets to principal cone-nets.\nProof. Let f be a discrete cone-net and f\u2217 a CCT of f . Since corresponding edge vectors of f and f\u2217 are parallel, the quadrilaterals qij of f have circumcirlces if and only if the quadrilaterals q\u2217ij of f \u2217 have circumcirlces.\nIn our investigation we will take advantage of the concept of the power of a point with respect to a circle (Fig. 8 left). Let C be a circle with center c and radius \u03c1, and let x be a point in the plane carrying that circle. Further, let l be a line through x intersecting the circle C in two points q1, q2. The (oriented) power of the point x with respect to the circle C is given by (see., e.g., [25])\np := \u3008x \u2212 q1, x \u2212 q2\u3009. The power is independent of the choice of the line l which implies\np = (\u2016c \u2212 x\u2016 + \u03c1)(\u2016c \u2212 x\u2016 \u2212 \u03c1). Note that the power is positive if x lies outside C and negative if x lies inside. The radical axis of two circles in a plane is the straight line of points with equal power to both circles. If two circles are intersecting, then the radical axis is given by the line through the intersection points. The three radical lines of three circles are either parallel if the three corresponding centers lie on a straight line or otherwise they meet in a point, the so called radical center (see, e.g., [25] and Fig. 8 center).\nDefinition 15. For a discrete principle net, we define the geodesic curvature \u03bagij of a quadrilateral qij in a strip Bj via the power of the Laplace point L2ij with respect to the circumcircle Cij :\n|\u03bagij | := |pij |\u2212 1 2 := |\u3008L2ij \u2212 fij ,L2ij \u2212 fi,j+1\u3009|\u2212 1 2\n= |\u3008L2ij \u2212 fi+1,j ,L2ij \u2212 fi+1,j+1\u3009|\u2212 1 2 .\nThe sign of the geodesic curvature is defined by considering the order of the points. The curvature is positive if fi,j+1 is between fij and L2ij and negative if fij is between fi,j+1 and L2ij .\nRemark 5. Note, that the powers of both Laplace points L1ij ,L2ij with respect to the circumcircle of the corresponding quadrilateral is positive if and only if the quadrilateral is embedded, cf. Fig. 8 right (i.e., fij , fi,j+1, fi+1,j+1, fi,j+1 lie on the convex hull of the quadrilateral in cyclic order).\nLemma 25. A discrete principle net is a cone-net, if and only if all horizontal or vertical strips have constant geodesic curvature.\nProof. Assume the horizontal strips Bj have constant geodesic curvature and consider two neighboring quadrilaterals qij , qi+1,j with circumcircles Cij , Ci+1,j . Since the quadrilaterals have the same geodesic curvature, we have\n\u3008L2ij \u2212 fi+1,j ,L2ij \u2212 fi+1,j+1\u3009\u2212 1 2 = \u3008L2ij \u2212 fij ,L2ij \u2212 fi,j+1\u3009\u2212 1 2\n= \u03bagij = \u03ba g i+1,j = \u3008L2i+1,j \u2212 fi+1,j ,L2i+1,j \u2212 fi+1,j+1\u3009\u2212 1 2 .\nTherefore, the Laplace points agree, i.e., L2ij = L2i+1,j . Induction on i implies that the strip Bj is a cone.\nNow, we assume that the strips Bj are cones. The cone tip rj = L2ij has the same power with respect to all circumcircles Cij of the strip Bj : pj = \u3008rj \u2212 fij , rj \u2212 fi,j+1\u3009 = \u3008rj \u2212 fi+1,j , rj \u2212 fi+1,j+1\u3009. Therefore, the geodesic curvature \u03bagij = p \u2212 12 j is constant for all quadrilaterals of the strip Bj .\nNote that for a principle cone-net, the cone tip rj is the radical center for any three circumcircles of the strip Bj which leads to the following definition.\nDefinition 16. We call the sphere with center rj and radius 1/\u03ba g ij geodesic curvature sphere and denote it by Sgj .\nLemma 26. Let f be a discrete principle cone-net and f\u2217 its CCT with respect to \u03bb, then the geodesic curvature of the cone-strips Bj change according to\n|\u03bag \u2217ij | = |\u03bagij |\n|\u03bbj\u03bbj+1|1/2 .\nProof. The CCT scales the boundary polygons of the cone-strip Bj by \u03bbj resp. \u03bbj+1, (see Corollary 21). Since corresponding edge vectors of f and f\u2217 are parallel, the distance between the polygons and the cone tip rj get scaled by the same factor. Therefore\n\u2016r\u2217j \u2212 f\u2217ij\u2016 = |\u03bbj | \u2016rj \u2212 fij\u2016 \u21d2 |p\u2217j | = \u2016r\u2217j \u2212 f\u2217ij\u2016 \u2016r\u2217j \u2212 f\u2217i,j+1\u2016 = |\u03bbj\u03bbj+1| \u2016rj \u2212 fij\u2016 \u2016rj \u2212 fi,j+1\u2016 \u21d2 |\u03bag \u2217ij | =\n1 |\u03bbj\u03bbj+1|1/2 |\u03ba g ij |.\nLemma 27. Let f be a principle cone-net and let j be fixed. Then the inversion at the geodesic curvature spheres Sgj preserves the circumcircles {Cij}i and maps the boundary polygons (fij)i and (fi,j+1)i of the strip Bj onto each other. In particular, Sgj intersects the circumcircles {Cij}i and the edges {fij\u2228fi,j+1}i orthogonally.\nProof. Since all faces of the strip are concyclic, the oriented power of rj with respect to the two corresponding vertices on these edges is constant\n\u3008fij \u2212 rj , fi,j+1 \u2212 rj\u3009 = pj = const for all i, and therefore\n\u3008fij \u2212 rj , fi,j+1 \u2212 rj\u3009(fi,j+1 \u2212 rj) = pj(fi,j+1 \u2212 rj). From the identity fi,j+1\u2212rj\u2016fi,j+1\u2212rj\u2016 = fij\u2212rj \u2016fij\u2212rj\u2016 \u3008fi,j+1\u2212rj ,fij\u2212rj\u3009 \u2016fi,j+1\u2212rj\u2016\u2016fij\u2212rj\u2016 we conclude\nfi,j+1 = pj fij \u2212 rj\n\u2016fij \u2212 rj\u20162 + rj . (21)\nThis equation represents an inversion in the geodesic curvature spheres Sgj with center rj and radius \u221a pj . Since the lines {Lij}i meet in the center of the sphere Sgj , they intersect Sgj orthogonally and the lines are mapped to themselves under the inversion above. Therefore, the quadrilaterals {qij}i and their circumcircles are preserved by the inversion. This is the case if and only if the circumcircles {Cij}i intersect the sphere Sgj orthogonally.\nSince Mo\u0308bius transformations map spheres to spheres and preserve angles, we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 28. A Mo\u0308bius transformation applied to the vertices of a discrete principal cone-net is a discrete principal cone-net.\nNote that the new cone tips are in general not obtained by the Mo\u0308bius transformation applied to the old cone tips. They are the centers of the new geodesic curvature spheres.\nRemark 6. (Cauchy data for principle cone-nets) Suppose we are given a principle cone-net with horizontal cone-strips Bj and constant geodesic curvature spheres Sgj . Then the coordinate polygons (fij)j are orthogonal trajectories of the geodesic curvature spheres Sgj . In particular, the surface f is uniquely determined by an initial polygon (fi,0)i and the family of geodesic curvature spheres Sgj .\nLemma 29. Any four points fij , fi,j+1, fi+k,j , fi+k,j+1 of a cone-strip of a principle cone-net are concyclic (see Fig. 8 center). Further, the cone tip rj has the same power with respect to this circle as to any circumcircle of the strip.\nProof. Consider the circle C through the three points fij , fi,j+1, fi+k,j . The power of the cone tip rj with respect to the circle C is the same with respect to any circumcircle of the strip. Therefore, the line through rj and fi+k,j intersects C in the point fi+k,j+1.\n3.4.1. Discrete Tractrix Surfaces I. There are several discretizations of a tractrix curve (see, e.g., [26] where discretizations of the hyperbolic cosine are constructed from several discretizations of a tractrix). The following is based on a Darboux transformation for discrete curves [27].\nDefinition 17. Let xj , dj \u2208 R3 be two polygons such that \u2016\u03b4jxj\u2016 = \u2016\u03b4jdj\u2016, \u2016xj \u2212 dj\u2016 = const and the quadrilateral xj , xj+1, dj+1, dj lies in a plane but does not form a parallelogram. Then the polygons xj and dj are Darboux transforms of each other and tj := 12 (xj + dj) is called discrete tractrix with base polygon xj or dj (see Fig. 9 left and center).\nWe will define discrete tractrix surfaces in close analogy to Sect. 2.5.1.\nDefinition 18. Let xj , ki \u2208 R3 be two polygons and let us consider through each vertex of ki the discrete tractrix with base curve xj . Then the discrete net formed by these tractrices is called a generalized discrete tractrix surface. If the vertices of the initial polygon ki lie on a sphere around the first point of the base curve, we call the net discrete tractrix surface (see Fig. 10).\nLemma 30. The generalized discrete tractrix surface is a discrete conjugate net (i.e., a net with planar faces).\nProof. Since tj is the midpoint of xjdj and tj+1 is the midpoint of xj+1dj+1, the connecting line tjtj+1 passes through rj which is the midpoint of xjxj+1 (Fig. 9 left). This property does not depend on the initial vertex position of tj . Therefore, the quadrilateral generated by this tractrix construction through ki and ki+1 generates a quadrilateral ki, ki+1, k\u0303i+1, k\u0303i with edges kik\u0303i and kik\u0303i passing through a common point rj (see Fig. 9 right). This quadrilateral must therefore be planar. Consequently, all quadrilaterals of the net are planar.\nAll (generalized) tractrix surfaces are cone-nets with discrete cones along horizontal strips and with cone tips rj .\nLemma 31. Any tractrix surface is a discrete principal net with concyclic faces, i.e., if the initial polygon ki in the construction lies on a sphere with center xj then the quadrilaterals of the net have circumcircles.\nProof. This follows from elementary geometric properties of the power of a point with respect to a circle. We have (see Fig. 9 right)\n\u3008rj \u2212 ki, rj \u2212 k\u0303i\u3009 = \u2212\u3008rj \u2212 si, rj \u2212 k\u0303i\u3009 =: pj\nand\n\u3008rj \u2212 ki+1, rj \u2212 k\u0303i+1\u3009 = \u2212\u3008rj \u2212 si+1, rj \u2212 k\u0303i+1\u3009 = pj , which both equal pj since the power pj of the point rj with respect to the circumcircle of si, si+1, k\u0303i, k\u0303i+1 does not depend on the secant. Therefore, we obtain\n\u3008rj \u2212 ki, rj \u2212 k\u0303i\u3009 = \u3008rj \u2212 ki+1, rj \u2212 k\u0303i+1\u3009, which is only possible if the four points ki, ki+1, k\u0303i+1, k\u0303i lie on a circle.\nIn analogy to Corollary 12 we can show the following two theorems.\nTheorem 32. Any CCT of a discrete tractrix surface is a proper discrete principal cone-net.\nProof. Let f be a discrete tractrix surface. Theorem 20 implies that any CCT of a discrete tractrix surface is a discrete cone-net. The transformed net is also a principal net since all edge-wise parallel quadrilaterals of a concyclic quadrilateral are concyclic. Theorem 33. Any proper discrete principal cone-net with spherical parameter polygons (fij)i is a CCT of a discrete tractrix surface.\nProof. Let f be a discrete principal cone-net with spherical parameter polygons (fij)i. Furthermore, let S f j be the sphere with radius Rj containing the polygon (fij)i. The CCT with \u03bbj = 1Rj transforms f into a net h := C 1Rj (f) where every polygon (hij)i is obtained by a scaling of (fij)i with factor 1Rj (up to translation). The corresponding spheres Shj which contain (hij)i are obtained from Shj by scaling with the same factor 1 Rj\nand are therefore unit spheres. Let rhj denote the cone tips of h. The inversion in the geodesic curvature sphere of h centered at cone tips rhj maps S h j to S h j+1. Since the two spheres are unit spheres, rhj must be the midpoint of the two centers of the spheres.\nThe construction from the spherical polygon (hij)i to the polygon (hi,j+1) corresponds to the tractrix construction (see Fig. 9 right). Consequently, h is a tractrix surface. And f = CRj (h) which concludes the proof. 3.4.2. Discrete Tractrix Surfaces II. We obtain another discretization of a tractrix surface by discretizing the characterizing property of Lemma 10. A tractrix surface is parametrized by a family of orthogonal trajectories of a oneparameter family of spheres with constant radii. Lemma 27 readily provides us with the discrete trajectory construction.\nDefinition 19. Let fi,0 be a polygon and S g j be a sequence of geodesic curvature spheres of constant radii. Then the successive inversion of the initial polygon in the geodesic curvature spheres generates a discrete tractrix-II surface.\nTwo endpoints fi,0, fi+1,0 of an edge together with their reflections fi,1, fi+1,1 in the first geodesic curvature sphere generate a concyclic quadrilateral. The straight lines fi,0 \u2228 fi,1 and fi+1,0 \u2228 fi+1,1 pass through the center of the geodesic curvature sphere. Therefore, the tractrix-II surface f is a principal cone-net.\nConsequently, all results obtained so far for discrete principal cone-nets hold for this type of tractrix-II surface. The main difference to the previous definition of tractrix surfaces is that the discrete parameter curves (fij)i do not necessarily lie on a sphere.\nWe therefore obtain a theorem in analogy to Theorem 33 but without the requirement of spherical parameter polygons.\nTheorem 34. Any proper discrete principal cone-net is a CCT of a discrete tractrix-II surface.\nProof. The radius of the geodesic curvature sphere of a proper discrete principal cone-net is 1/|\u03bagij |. Therefore, Lemma 26 yields the radii of the transformed geodesic curvature spheres after a CCT with function \u03bb. Consequently, \u03bb can be chosen in such a way that |\u03bag \u2217ij | is constant for all j which implies that f\u2217 is a tractrix-II surface.\n3.4.3. Discrete Canal Surfaces. Stripmodels from annulus-shaped strips of surfaces of revolution have been studied, e.g., in [5,6]. These are (semi-) discretizations of a particular class of canal surfaces. Discrete canal surfaces have recently been revisited in [14]. In the present subsection we will give a novel and more flexible definition of canal surfaces that includes the discrete canal surfaces from [14]. Our definition is based on the notion of a Mo\u0308bius invariant definition of a curvature circle for discrete curves [28].\nThe following notions are explained in more detail in [28]. Let us identify R 3 with the imaginary part ImH of the quaternions H. Then four points\na, b, c, d have the cross-ratio cr(a, b, c, d) := (a \u2212 b)(b \u2212 c)\u22121(c \u2212 d)(d \u2212 a)\u22121. A new point is computed by\np(a, b, c, d)\n:= ( (b \u2212 a)(c \u2212 a)\u22121 \u221a cr(c, a, b, d) + 1 )\u22121( (b \u2212 a)(c \u2212 a)\u22121 \u221a cr(c, a, b, d)c + b ) .\nIt turns out [28, Cor. 4] that p(a, b, c, d) always lies on the circumsphere of a, b, c, d and that the four points p(a, b, c, d), p(b, c, d, a), p(c, d, a, b), p(d, a, b, c) always lie on a circle [28, Th. 1]. If a, b, c, d are four successive points of a discrete curve then this circle can be interpreted as a curvature circle for the discrete curve at edge bc [28, Th. 4]. If a, b, c, d lie on a circle then this circle is identical to the curvature circle [28, Cor. 1]. Since the curvature lines of a smooth canal surface are circles and since a curve with a constant curvature circle must be a circle, we impose in the following definition on our discrete parameter curves in circular direction to have a constant curvature circle.\nDefinition 20. A discrete canal surface is a principal cone-net f with spherical parameter curves (fij)i with constant curvature circles. We call the reciprocals of the radii of the spheres discrete principal curvatures (in circle direction) \u03ba1(j).\nNote that discrete parameter curves in circular directions of canal surfaces in our definition are not necessarily concyclic even though the curvature circle is constant along the curve. However, since the curvature circle of a concyclic polygon equals the circumcircle, the canal surfaces from [14] constitute a subclass of ours as there concyclic parameter curves are required (see Fig. 11 for illustrations of discrete canal surfaces).\nIn analogy to Theorem 13 discrete canal surfaces are characterized by their Gauss image. The discrete Gauss image of a net f is (in our setting) a net which is edge-wise parallel to f with vertices on a sphere (cf. [8]).\nTheorem 35. A discrete principal cone-net is a canal surface if and only if its Gauss image is a canal surface.\nProof. Lemma 27 implies that the polygons (fij)i and (fi,j+1)i are mapped onto each other by inversion in the geodesic curvature sphere Sgj with center rj . Therefore, the sphere containing (fi,j+1)i can be mapped to the sphere S containing (fij)i by a homothety. Applying this homothety to the entire net yields a net with two co-spherical parameter polygons on S. In this way we generated the Gauss image of the first strip Bj since all edges are parallel to the corresponding edges of the original net. We can continue by mapping the next parameter curve (fi,j+2)i to S with another homothety. In this way by continuing we obtain the Gauss image. Since corresponding parameter curves of f and its Gauss image only differ by a homothety (which is a Mo\u0308bius transformation) either both have a constant curvature circle or none.\nDefinition 21. A (vertex) offset fd of a discrete principal net f has the same combinatorics as f such that corresponding edges are parallel and the distance between corresponding vertices is constant.\nFor nets over a simply connected domain the existence of a vertex offset net is equivalent to the existence of an edgewise parallel net (fd\u2212f)/d inscribed into the unit sphere [29] which is the discrete Gauss image. Note that the set of edgewise parallel nets is a vector space with vertex-wise addition and scalar multiplication.\nTheorem 36. Let f be a discrete canal surface and \u03ba1(j) the discrete principle curvature of the discrete circular parameter curves. The offset fd is up to translation a CCT of f for \u03bbj = 1 + d \u03ba1(j).\nProof. By the proof of Theorem 35 the Gauss image n exists and corresponding i-parameter curves are related by a homothety. The scaling factor from (fij)i to its Gauss image (nij)i is \u03ba1(j). Consequently,\nfd = f + d n\nimplies\n(fij)di = (fij)i + d (nij)i = (fij)i + d \u03ba1(j)(fij)i = (1 + d \u03ba1(j))(fij)i,\nwhich concludes the proof.\nLemma 37. Any double principle cone-net f : Z2 \u2192 R3 is a multi-circular net (cf. Definition 13).\nProof. Bobenko et al. [15, Th. 2.4] show that any double cone-net is a multicone-net. Moreover, Lemma 29 implies that any strip Bj is a multi-circular strip in itself. Consequently, the strip (fi0,j , fi1,j , fi1,j+1, fi0,j+1)j is a circular conestrip and by Lemma 29 a multi-circular strip. Hence, the quadrilateral (fi0,j0 , fi1,j0 , fi1,j1 , fi0,j1) is concyclic and therefore the net is multi-circular.\nIn analogy to Theorem 16 we obtain:\nTheorem 38. Every discrete double principal cone-net is Mo\u0308bius equivalent to a surface of revolution, cone or cylinder.\nProof. Lemma 37 implies that the net is multi-circular. Bobenko et al. [15, Th. 7.7] show that multi-circular nets are Mo\u0308bius equivalent to surfaces of revolution, cones or cylinders."

            "text": "Proof of Theorem 16. We prove the statement by analyzing three cases. Before we start with that we compute the derivatives of the curves traced out by the cone tips. Let f : U \u2192 R3 be a double principal cone-net. Theorem 7 implies that f is a K\u0153nigs net and orthogonal K\u0153nigs nets are isothermic. After a possible reparameterization (u \u2192 u\u0303(u), v \u2192 v\u0303(v)), we can assume that the parameterization is conformal, i.e., \u03b1 = \u2016fu\u2016 = \u2016fv\u2016 = \u03b2. Then we have\n\u03b2v \u03b2 = \u03b1v \u03b1 (6) = \u2212\u03b2\u03ba \u03b1 = \u2212\u03ba, \u03b1u \u03b1 = \u03b2u \u03b2 (7) = \u03b1\u03b7 \u03b2 = \u03b7. (A1)\nFor coordinate curves with non-vanishing geodesic curvature we denote the tips of the cones along the u-parameter curves by r(v) and the tips of the cones tangent to the v-parameter curves by s(u). Using Eq. (2) and the frame Eqs. (5) we compute the curve of cone tips\nr(v) (12) = f(u, v) + \u03b1 \u03ba Y (u, v) and analogously s(u) = f(u, v) \u2212 \u03b1 \u03b7 X(u, v),\nand their derivatives:\nrv(v) (5) = \u2212\u03b7\u03b1\n\u03ba X +\n( \u03b1 + (\u03b1 \u03ba ) v ) Y + d\u03b1 \u03ba N (A1) = \u03b1 \u03ba ( \u2212 \u03b7X \u2212 \u03bav \u03ba Y + dN )\nsu(u) (5) = ( \u03b1 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u03b7 ) u ) X \u2212 \u03ba\u03b1 \u03b7 Y \u2212 c\u03b1 \u03b7 N (A1) = \u03b1 \u03b7 (\u03b7u \u03b7 X \u2212 \u03baY + \u2212cN ) . (A2)\nAfter this preparatory work we start to analyze three cases depending on the values of the geodesic curvature of the parameter lines. First, note that the (generalized) spheres of the family S(u) with centers s(u) and radii |kvg |\u22121 intersect the (generalized) spheres of the family S(v) with centers r(v) and radii |kug |\u22121 orthogonally since f(u, v) \u2212 s(u) \u22a5 f(u, v) \u2212 r(v). \u2014Case 1: All parameter curves are geodesics. Consequently, \u03b7 = \u03ba = 0. From the Gauss Eq. (8), we obtain 0 = \u03bav \u2212 \u03b7u = cd. If c = 0, we further have Xv = Xu = Yu = 0 (cf. (5)), hence the u-curves are straight lines and the surface is a cylinder over the v-curves. The case d = 0 works analogously.\n\u2014Case 2: The u-curves are geodesics and there exist v-curves that are not geodesics. Consequently, \u03ba = 0. Due to Lemma 8 and its proof the geodesics are contained in the planes S(v) = {x \u2208 R3 | \u3008x \u2212 f(u, v), Y (v)\u3009} which intersect the spheres S(u) orthogonally. Therefore, S(v) contains the centers of S(u).\nAll planes S(v) are orthogonal to any sphere S(u) hence they all pass through their centers s(u). Let us choose an arbitrary sphere S(u0). Consequently, all planes S(v) pass through s(u0). Now, either all these planes only share one point, s(u0), or they share a straight line passing through s(u0). In the first case the spheres S(u) are concentric which implies su(u) = 0 and Eq. (A2) yields \u03b7u = c = 0. This implies Xu = 0 (cf. (5)) and the u-curves\nare straight lines that meet in the common center of the spheres. The surface is therefore a cone.\nIn the second case the centers of S(u) lie on a straight line s(u). From \u03ba = 0 we obtain that Y is orthogonal to su(u) (see Eq. (A2)). This implies that the v-curves lie in planes orthogonal to su(u) and the surface is a surface of revolution.\n\u2014Case 3: Both families of parameter curves contain curves with nonvanishing geodesic curvature. The Gauss Equation (8) implies that the tangent vectors of the curves of cone tips are orthogonal at every point\n\u3008rv(v), su(u)\u3009 = \u03b1 \u03ba \u03b1 \u03b7 (\u2212\u03b7u + \u03bav \u2212 cd) = 0.\nNote that neither rv(v) nor su(u) can be zero because if one family of spheres is concentric, then the other family has to consist of planes containing the center. This would contradict the assumption, that both families of parameter curves contain curves with non-vanishing geodesic curvature. Hence, one of the curves is a straight line and the other one lies in a plane orthogonal to this line. W.l.o.g., we assume that r(v) is contained in the z-axis and that s(u) is contained in the xy-plane. We choose a sphere S(u0) with radius R(u0) = (\u03bau0g ) \u22121 and center s(u0) in the xy-plane. For every sphere S(v) we denote the\ndistance of its center r(v) to the center s(u0) by D(v) (see Fig. 12). Pythagoras\u2019 theorem implies\n\u2016s(u0)\u20162 + \u2016r(v)\u20162 = D(v)2 = R2(v) + R(u0)2 \u21d4 R2(v) \u2212 \u2016r(v)\u20162 = \u2016s(u0)\u20162 \u2212 R(u0)2 =: q,\nfor some q \u2208 R. If q > 0 (Fig. 12 left), the last equation implies that all spheres S(v) intersect the xy-plane in the same circle {(x, y, 0) \u2208 R3 | x2 + y2 = q}. After applying a Mo\u0308bius transformation that maps this circle to a straight line the spheres S(v) become planes that intersect in that line and we are in the same situation as considered in Case 2. If q < 0 (Fig. 12 right), all the spheres S(v) intersect the sphere K := {(x, y, z) \u2208 R3 | x2+y2+z2 = \u2212q} orthogonally and the spheres S(u) intersect the z-axis in the points (0, 0,\u00b1q). The inversion in the sphere with center (0, 0,\u2212q) and radius \u221a\u22122q, maps the sphere K to the xy-plane and the z-axis to itself. Since the spheres S(v) intersect K and the z-axis orthogonally, their images under the inversion are spheres centered at the origin. The spheres S(u) get mapped to planes containing the origin because they contain the points (0, 0,\u00b1q). Hence, we are again in the same situation as discussed in Case 2. If q = 0, all spheres contain the origin. An inversion at any sphere with the origin as center maps all the spheres to planes. This situation was considered in Case 1."
