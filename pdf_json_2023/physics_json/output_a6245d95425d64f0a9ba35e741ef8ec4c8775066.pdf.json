Older ages and multiple chronic conditions were reported to be critical factors of increased morbidity and mortality, in contrast to younger patients who had mild symptoms and better outcomes without comorbidity. Reasons for the exceptional contagiousness and severity of clinical manifestations remain unclear.\nAltered redox balance is one the recognized mechanisms of cell damage due to viral infections. Viruses disturb metabolic processes in host cells inducing over generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deficiency of glutathione (GSH) leading to enhanced oxidative stress. It has been shown that virus merge with cell membrane depends on thiol-disulfide homeostasis[1-3]. Low-molecular weight aminothiols (cysteine [Cys], cysteine-glycine [CysGly], glutathione [GSH], glutamatecysteine [Glu-Cys], homocysteine [Hcy]) are crucial for metabolic processes that maintain the development of host\nresponse in COVID-19[4].\nGSH is one of the essential intracellular ROS scavengers, and glutathionylation is an important mechanism for the post-translational regulation of protein function[5]. A low level of reduced GSH is associated with an increased propensity of respiratory infections and poor cardiometabolic outcomes. Moreover, GSH level is considered a predictor of atherothrombotic events[6-8]. GSH is derived from homocysteine via the transsulfuration pathway and can also be synthesized from cysteine\u2013the product of hydrolysis of extracellular proteins and GSH itself. Homocysteine, produced from methionine through intermediate products S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine, can regulate the expression of cytokines and acute phase protein-coding genes as well as the production of viral particles[9]. However, hyperhomocysteinemia induces oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis and activates type 1 angiotensin \u2161 receptors. Meanwhile, ROS inhibits methionine synthase and betaine-homocysteine\nObjective: Clinical manifestation of the inflammatory process in its relation to biochemical markers (total cysteine [Cys], cysteine-glycine [CysGly], glutathione [GSH], glutamate-cysteine [Glu-Cys], homocysteine [Hcy], the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione [GSH/GSSG], the ratio of reduced to oxidized cysteine [CySH/CySS], malondialdehyde-oxidized low-density lipoproteins [MDA-oxLDL]) has been studied in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Material and methods: 48 patients with mild to severe COVID-19 and 20 healthy volunteers were included in our research. The participants were divided into 4 experimental groups according to inflammation intensity estimated based on the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6). Results: All 4 groups showed the prevalence of male patients and elevated serum levels of IL-6 (by 54.6%). There was no comorbidity in patients with mild COVID-19 (nasopharyngitis symptoms) and in healthy control subjects. 50% of patients with lung damage had accompanying diseases. Alterations of aminoethyl metabolism were detected in COVID-19 patients: as reflected by the decreased levels of Cys, CysGly, and Glu-Cys and the increased levels of GSH as compared to the control group. Conclusion: Elevation of IL-6 over 7.5 pg/mL was associated with decreased GSH/GSSG and CySH/CySS ratios indicating enhanced oxidative stress and was followed by protein oxidation, specifically MDA-oxLDL."

            "text": "Decreases in Cys and CysGly could be considered a sign of enhanced synthesis of glutathione and an indirect marker of intensive ROS production.\nThe development of oxidative stress in COVID-19 could be explained by the following mechanisms:\nRespiratory viruses induce mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation via activation of NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and iNO-synthase[11-14]; SARS-CoV-2 activates ATP, which causes an elevation of AT-\u2161 level and then activates NADPH oxidase and peroxynitrite thereby exaggerated ROS production[15]; SARS-\nin 20% of patients, low-grade fever in 34%, moderate fever in 38%, and high-grade fever in 8% (P = 0.000 1). 57% of patients developed arterial hypertension, predominantly in the 4th subgroup (P = 0.000 3). Patients with IL-6 levels of \uff1e15-25 pg/mL developed low-grade fever, moderate lung injury (CTS 1-2), and decreased arterial blood oxygen saturation to 96%-97%. Patients with IL-6 levels over 25 pg/mL developed moderate fever, severe lung injury (CTS 3-4), decreased arterial blood saturation down to < 96%, and increased systolic blood pressure over 150 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg.\nThere were no accompanying diseases in patients with mild COVID-19 and in controls. Patients with lung damage demonstrated approximately equal percentage of comorbidity (Table 1).\nIL-6 level was within the normal range in controls. Patients who had no clinical manifestations or had been diagnosed with mild COVID-19 (nasopharyngitis symptoms) were assigned to the 2nd subgroup according to the IL-6 levels of\uff1e 7-15 pg/mL. Patients with IL-6 levels of \uff1e 15-25 pg/mL and higher had moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia and were composed of the 3rd and 4th subgroups.\nAssessment of total aminothiols revealed decreases in Cys, CysGly, and Glu-Cys levels coupled with an elevation of plasma glutathione, regardless of the severity of COVID-19 (Table 2, Fig.1).\nIn patients with IL-6 levels ranging from \uff1e15-25 pg/mL to \uff1e 25 pg/mL, glutathione was increased by 1.8 (P = 0.035) and 2.5 (P = 0.000 4) times, respectively. There was decrease of GSH/ GSSG ratio in patients with IL-6 level more than 7.2 pg/mL. Rise in MDA-oxidized LDLP was detected in all examinated patients: the highest level was revealed in the 2nd subgroup (P \uff1c 0.05), the lowest \u2013 in the 4th subgroup (P = 0.002) (Table 2).\nCoV-2 particles bind to CD147 on erythrocytes surface and enter cells, leading to the destruction of hemoglobin and release of iron, which can induce oxidative damage[16]; Activated phagocytes produce ROS and initiate an inflammatory process[17].\nThe lowest precursors of glutathione have been associated with an increased concentration of IL-6 to more than 25 pg/mL, an indicator of exacerbated oxidative stress in patients with more severe lung injury.\nIncreasing serum levels of glutathione and homocysteine could be caused by their leakage during exocytosis of virus-containing vesicles, which does not depend on inflammation intensity.\nSignificantly reduced GSH/GSSG ratios in COVID-19 patients compared to controls had no correlation with disease severity, which could presumably be a sign of antioxidants insufficiency. Decreased CySH/CySS ratio was, in contrast, significantly different in all investigated subgroups. The value of the ratio reflects redox balance in biological fluids and can be considered as one of the important vital signs[18]. Cysteine and methionine oxidation end with the formation of disulfides[19]. It is particularly dangerous if such a process involves proteins enriched with cysteine residues such as mitogen-activated protein kinases, receptors of insulin and insulin-like growth factor, and ion channels. Hence, dimerization or autoactivation of these proteins without specific signaling molecules can cause cell dysfunction. It has been suggested that thiol and disulfide groups at cell-virus interphase could act as donors or acceptors of electrons, which are required for conformation changes promoting a fusion of viruses and host cells[20].\nFree radicals, especially ROS, cannot be eliminated from the cells, due to their signaling function. However, the human body has intrinsic ROS-buffering capacities to maintain the functionalities of proteins under moderate oxidative stress conditions. Nonetheless, some proteins, for example, low-density lipoproteins, are much less resistant to oxidation damage and\nsubsequent degradation[21]. Our data demonstrated an elevation of MDA-oxLDL in all COVID-19 patients with the highest values in the 2nd subgroup (P = 0.000 01), which could be related to higher saturation of the ROS-buffering mechanism and greater impairment of the cellular respiration, thereby enhanced ROS production."
