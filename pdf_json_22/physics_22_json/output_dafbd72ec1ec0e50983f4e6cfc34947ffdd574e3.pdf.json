    "abstractText": "The eternally non-Markovian Pauli channel is an example of a unital channel characterized by a negative decay rate for all time t > 0. Here we consider the problem of constructing an analogous non-unital channel, and show in particular that a d-dimensional generalized amplitude damping (GAD) channel cannot be eternally non-Markovian when the non-Markovianity originates solely from the non-unital part of the channel. We study specific ramifications of this result for qubit GAD. Specifically, we construct a quasi-eternally non-Markovian qubit GAD channel, characterized by a time t\u2217 > 0, such that the channel is non-Markovian only and for all time t > t\u2217. We further point out that our negative result for the qudit GAD channel, namely the impossibility of the eternal non-Markovian property, does not hold for a general qubit or higher-dimensional non-unital channel.",

Here we consider the problem of constructing an analogous non-unital channel, and show in particular that a d-dimensional generalized amplitude damping (GAD) channel cannot be eternally non-Markovian when the non-Markovianity originates solely from the non-unital part of the channel. We study specific ramifications of this result for qubit GAD. Specifically, we construct a quasi-eternally non-Markovian qubit GAD channel, characterized by a time t\u2217 > 0, such that the channel is non-Markovian only and for all time t > t\u2217. We further point out that our negative result for the qudit GAD channel, namely the impossibility of the eternal non-Markovian property, does not hold for a general qubit or higher-dimensional non-unital channel.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOpen quantum systems is the study of the dynamics of the system of interest taking into account the effect of its ambient environment and an important aspect of this is the study of nonMarkovian (NM) dynamics [1\u20133], which has gained increasing attention recently in the quantum information theory community [4\u201310]. A number of definitions of non-Markovianity have been proposed namely, based on distinguishability [11], completely positive (CP-) divisibility, fidelity [12], negativity of the decay rate [13, 14], quantum temporal correlations [15, 16] and a more general definition based on deviation from semigroup structure [17], to name a few.\nThe notion of quantum non-Markovianity has always been debated, see for instance Ref. [7, 18\u201322]. Its revived interest is due to the advent of newer experiments with finer engineered baths, which highlight the fact that there exists no universal definition or criterion which faithfully characterizes, detects or measures quantum non-Markovianity. Most of the developments focused on the two-time dynamical maps and the divisibility criterion based on the two-time correlation functions in determining the Markovian status of open system dynamics, See Ref. [4\u20136]. A stronger notion of quantum Markovianity has recently been developed, that is based on an operational point of view [18\u201323] and eschews the use of the concept of the not-completely positive (NCP) intermediate map. Moreover, this approach meets the status of necessity and sufficiency of characterizing non-Markovianity when multi-time correlations correlations are taken into account. For the present purpose of this work, we restrict ourselves to the divisibility criteria based on the two-time correlations and two-time dynamical map formalism. In particular, we will be concerned with the eternal CP-indivisibility and P-indivisibility of channels whose non-Markovianity originates solely from the non-unital part, which we definite shortly.\nAn open system evolution is generally given by the famous Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad\n\u2217 shrikant.phys@gmail.com \u2020 subhashish@iitj.ac.in \u2021 srik@ppsir.res.in\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n10 62\n5v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 O\nct 2\n02 3\n2 (GKSL)-like master equation [24, 25]:\n\u03c1\u0307 = L(t)[\u03c1] = \u2212i[H, \u03c1] \u2212 \u2211\nj\n\u03b3j(t) (\nAj(t)\u03c1A\u2020j(t) \u2212 1 2{A \u2020 j(t)Aj(t), \u03c1}\n) , (1)\nwhere \u03b3j(t) are the canonical decay rates [14] and Aj(t) are the jump operators. Assuming that the system state \u03c1S(t = 0) and environment initially fixed in the state \u03c1E = |e0\u27e9 \u27e8e0| is a product i.e., \u03c1SE = \u03c1S(0) \u2297 \u03c1E , one can deduce a completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) dynamical map on the system state via the operator-sum form [2, 25]:\nE(t)[\u03c1] = \u2211\nj\n\u27e8ej | U(\u03c1S(0) \u2297 |e0\u27e9 \u27e8e0|)U\u2020 |ej\u27e9 = \u2211\nj\nEj(t)\u03c1SE\u2020j (t),\nwhere Kj(t) \u2261 \u27e8ej | U |e0\u27e9 are called the Kraus operators, where U is joint system-environment unitary. The map E is in fact the solution to the master equation E\u0307 = LE , which, for all t \u2265 s \u2265 t0, is given by E(t, t0) = T exp{ \u00b4 t t0\ndsL(s)}, where T is the time-ordering operator. However, it is well-known that when the initial factorization assumption is relaxed, the ensuing dynamical map need not be CP [26\u201328]. Moreover, if a map could be written down, one must sacrifice either complete positivity or linearity. Therefore, we stress that the dynamical maps defined throughout this work are obtained based on the initial factorization assumption.\nNow, we are in a position to define the concept of divisibility of a map.\nA CPTP qubit map E(t2, t0) (a qubit quantum channel) is said to be CP-divisible if for arbitrary intermediate time t1 it can be written as\nE(t2, t0) = E(t2, t1)E(t1, t0), (2)\nsuch that E(t2, t1) is a CP-map. The Choi-Jamiolkowski matrix [29] or B-matrix [30] for a map E(t2, t1) is given by\n\u03c7 = (E(t2, t1) \u2297 I)[|\u03a8\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8|], (3)\nwhere |\u03a8\u27e9 = 1\u221a2 (|00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9) is a maximally entangled state. When \u03c7 is negative, the channel E(t2, t0) is CP-indivisible, in the sense that it is a CPTP map that cannot be written as composition of CP maps as in Eq. (2). For bijective maps, the above requirement is equivalent to the following condition for CP-divisibility\nd dt \u2225[Id+1 \u2297 E(t)](\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12)\u22251 \u2264 0 (4)\nbeing always satisfied for given any two density operators \u03c11 and \u03c12 in the space of bounded operators of the bipartite system B(Hd+1 \u2297 Hd) [31]. Here, \u2225A\u22251 = Tr( \u221a A\u2020A) is the trace norm of an operator A. The channel E(t2, t0) satisfies P-divisibility if\nd dt \u2225E(t)[\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12]\u22251 \u2264 0 (5)\nfor any initial pair of states \u03c11 and \u03c12. Note that when the condition (5) breaks down, the intermediate map E(t2, t1) would no longer be positive, in the sense that it outputs a negative state. However, the full map E(t2, t0) is still CPTP but no longer P-divisible.\nThe notion of an \u201ceternally non-Markovian\u201d (ENM) Pauli channels was proposed in [14] via\n3 the canonical master equation given by\nL(t)[\u03c1] = 3\u2211\nj=1 \u03b3j(t)(\u03c3j\u03c1\u03c3j \u2212 \u03c1) (6)\nwhere \u03c3j are the Pauli operators, and the canonical decay rates \u03b3j(t) are given by \u03b31 = \u03b32 = c2 and \u03b33(t) = \u2212 c2 tanh t, where c is some real constant. This particular dynamics corresponds to CPTP map E(t)\u03c1 = \u22113 j=1 Ej\u03c1E \u2020 j , with the Kraus operators given by\nE1 = \u221a 2k\u03c3I , E2 = \u221a k\u03c3X ; E3 = \u221a k\u03c3y (7)\nwhere\nk \u2261 14(1 \u2212 e \u2212ct). (8)\nFor Pauli channels, it is straightforward to arrive at Eq. (7) from Eq. (6) from the so-called H-matrix method [32, 33]. This example was later shown to arise under the mixing of two Pauli semigroups [34], providing an example of the fact that the space of CP-divisible Pauli channels is not convex [35]. This is an instance in which the criterion Eq. (5) for witnessing nonMarkovianity fails [14]. Interestingly, in [36] the authors studied whole families of eternal and quasi-eternal unital channels. ENM evolution arising from a convex combination of Markovian semigroups has recently been extended to the context of generalized Pauli channels in dimension k [37], where it is shown that (d \u2212 1)2 out of d2 \u2212 1 decay rates can be always negative.\nThe examples of ENM evolution given above all have two broad restrictions: (1) the concept of non-Markovianity here refers to CP-indivisibility, and not the stronger condition of P-indivisibility; (2) they consider only unital\u2013 specifically Pauli\u2013 channels. Here we wish to address the 2nd of these points. So far as known to us, there are only a few works addressing similar questions about non-unital channels. Here we undertake to do this, studying in detail the generalized amplitude damping (GAD) channels [2, 38].\nBefore embarking on our results, we present a notion of non-unital non-Markovianity as below. Any d-dimensional dynamical map may be given a matrix representation as E(t) \u2192 F (t) as\nF (t) = ( 1 01\u00d7(d2\u22121)\n\u03c4 M\n) , (9)\nwhere \u03c4 \u2208 Rd2\u22121 and M is a d2 \u22121\u00d7d2 \u22121 real matrix. Given the state \u03c1 = 1d (I+ \u2211d2\u22121\ni=1 riGi), where Gi are orthonormal basis given by the generalized Gell-Mann matrices with G0 = I\u221ad and the Hermitian Gi where i \u2208 {1, .....d2 \u2212 1}, then the map Fij(t) := Tr(GiE [Gj ]), which transforms a Bloch vector r as\nr \u2192 r\u2032(t) = M(t)r(0) + \u03c4 (t). (10)\nIf r1 and r2 are two Bloch vectors corresponding to the states \u03c11 and \u03c12, then from Eq. (9) and (10), the transformation E(t)[\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12] corresponds to M(t)[r1 \u2212 r2]. Therefore, the trace distance fails to witness non-Markovianity originating solely from \u03c4 . However, the full nonMarkovianity, in the sense of P-indivisibility is encoded in the map F (t). Interestingly, the divisibility property of E(t) carried over as F (t) = F (t, s)F (s) leads to a non-trivial relationship\n4 between unital and non-unital parts of the channel:\nM(t) = M(t, s)M(s) and \u03c4 (t) = \u03c4 (t, s) + M(t, s)\u03c4 (s). (11)\nTherefore, the full P-indivisibility is captured by Eq. (11).\nDefinition 1 When non-Markovianity originates solely from the non-unital part, i.e., from \u03c4 (t), then we call it non-unital non-Markovianity and such a channel will be called purely non-unital non-Markovian channel.\nGiven this notion, we ask: is eternal non-unital non-Markovianity, as per the Definition (1), possible? We answer this in the negative for a class of non-unital channels. However, we will later show that for a class of phase-covariant channels and higher dimensional non-unital channels, eternal non-Markovianity is still possible, nonetheless such a non-Markovianity originates from the unital part of the channel.\nThis is work is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce a d-level GAD channel for d-dimensional systems and show that it cannot be eternally non-Markovian. In Section III, we further provide rigorous proof for the case of qubit GAD channel and show that the utmost one can achieve in this direction is a quasi-eternal non-Markovian GAD channel, of which we explicitly construct a qubit example. In Section IV, we point out that this negative result does not extend to non-unital channels in general, by providing an example of a non-unital channel that is ENM. We present our conclusions in Section V."

In this work, generalizing the well-known d-level amplitude damping channel [40, 41], we introduce a d-level GAD channel EG for d-dimensional systems given by\nEG = d\u22121\u2211 l=0 plEl, (12)\nwhere pl is the probability with which the lth damping channel El acts on a d-dimensional system, along with the constraint that \u2211 l pl = 1. Here El damps an arbitrary input state\n\u03c1 to the state |l\u27e9\u27e8l| with probability \u03bb, and is defined by the Kraus representation El[\u03c1] =\u2211d\u22121 j=0 El,j\u03c1E \u2020 l,j\nwith the Kraus operators in terms of damping parameter \u03bb as\nEl,l = |l\u27e9\u27e8l| + \u221a 1 \u2212 \u03bb d\u22121\u2211 k=0 k \u0338=l |k\u27e9\u27e8k| ; El,j = \u221a \u03bb |l\u27e9\u27e8j| , (l \u0338= j). (13)\nA key point about the damping channels is that they have a unique fixed point F. For the amplitude damping channels El it is |l\u27e9\u27e8l|, and for the higher-dimensional GAD channel the fixed point is F \u2261 \u2211d\u22121 l=0 pl |l\u27e9\u27e8l|.\nWe have the following result.\n5 Theorem 1 A non-unital GAD channel in any finite dimension d that is eternally CPindivisible in the non-unital part is impossible.\nProof: In the Markovian case, any initial state is driven monotonically towards the fixed point F, fulfilling Eq. (4) for all pair of states \u03c11 and \u03c12. If this CP-divisibility condition is violated at time t = 0, then there is a pair of states such that\nd dt \u2225[I \u2297 E(t)](\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12)\u2225t=0 > 0. (14)\nWith the idea of maximizing the l.h.s in Eq. (14), we let \u03c12 \u2261 I \u2297 F and \u03c11 \u2261 I \u2297 \u03c1S for an arbitrary system state \u03c1S .\nIt can be shown that the action of the GAD channel Eq. (12) is described by\nE(\u03c1S)[t] = \u03bb(t)F + {(1 \u2212 \u03bb(t))F + \u221a 1 \u2212 \u03bb(t)G}, (15)\nwhere G is a matrix consisting only of off-diagonal terms dependent on the initial state. In the Markovian case, \u03bb(t) increases monotonically from 0 to 1, and thus E(\u03c1S)[t] evolves monotonically from the initial state to F. Note that this corresponds manifestly to non-unital behavior. In specific, E(F) = F at all times t, as required by the definition of a fixed point. We have from Eq. (15) that\n\u2225E(\u03c1S)[t] \u2212 F\u2225 = \u221a 1 \u2212 \u03bb(t)\u2225G\u2225. (16)\nGiven that GAD constitutes a CP map, \u03bb(t) \u2265 0 such that \u03bb(0) = 0. Thus, we have that \u03bb\u0307|t=0 \u2265 0. Then it follows from Eq. (16) that\nd dt \u2225E(\u03c1S) \u2212 F\u2225t=0 \u2264 0, (17)\ncontrary to the implication of Eq.

A key point is that the form Eq. (18) constrains the Markovian behavior of the channel, even without knowing details of the time dependence of the parameters.\nLemma 1 The damping parameter \u03bb(t) of the GAD channel is such that\nlim t\u21920+ \u03bb\u0307 \u2265 0, (19)\n6 meaning that for sufficiently small time t, the variable \u03bb(t) cannot decrease.\nProof: The functional form of Eq. (18) implies that\n\u03bb(t = 0) = 0 and \u2200t\u22650 \u03bb(t) \u2265 0, (20)\nwhere the first equation is a consequence of requiring that a channel must reduce to the identity map I at t = 0, and the second that of requiring that the map specified by Eq. (18) must be complete. Eq. (20) implies Eq. (19). \u25a1\nIt is well known that trace-distance can witness P-indivisibility. Our first result is to show that GAD cannot manifest eternal P-indivisibility. To this end, for the above map we have the affine representation\nr\u20d7\u2032(t) = M(t)r\u20d7(0) + \u03c4\u20d7(t) (21)\nwhere M is a 3 \u00d7 3 real matrix which modifies the Bloch vector r\u20d7 = (r1, r2, r3)T , and \u03c4\u20d7 = (\u03c41, \u03c42, \u03c43)T is the shift vector representing the displacement of Bloch vector towards the fixed point of the non-unital channel under consideration. Now, for a GAD channel we have\nM =  \u221a 1 \u2212 \u03bb 0 0 0 \u221a 1 \u2212 \u03bb 0\n0 0 1 \u2212 \u03bb\n ; \u03c4\u20d7 =  00\n(1 \u2212 2p)\u03bb  . (22) The non-Markovianity can arise from the unital part (the matrix M) or the non-unital part (the shift \u03c4\u20d7). For the most part in this paper, we set the notation p(t) = p and \u03bb(t) = \u03bb for simplicity.\nThe block diagonal representation of a dynamical map provides a straightforward way of connecting trace distance with the decay rates [14], hence we make use of this feature here. Eq. (21) obeys the canonical master equation in the Block diagonal representation\ndr\u20d7(t) dt = D(t)r\u20d7(t) + \u00b5\u20d7(t) (23)\nwhere D(t) and \u00b5\u20d7(t) are called damping matrix and drift vector respectively. In relation with Eq. (21) we have dM(t)dt = D(t)M(t) =\u21d2 M(t) = e \u00b4 t t0 D(s)ds . The channel E is CP-divisible when Tr[D(t)] < 0 and P-divisible when hmax(D(t) + D(t)T) < 0 [14], where hmax(X) is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix X.\nTheorem 2 A qubit GAD channel that is eternally non-Markovian as witnessed by the tracedistance measure is impossible.\nProof: For the qubit GAD channel Eq. (18), we have:\nD(t) =  \u2212\u03bb\u0307\n2(1\u2212\u03bb) 0 0 0 \u2212\u03bb\u03072(1\u2212\u03bb) 0 0 0 \u2212\u03bb\u03071\u2212\u03bb  . (24) At time t \u2192 0, we have hmax(D(t) + D(t)T) = \u2212\u03bb\u03071\u2212\u03bb , which by virtue of Lemma 1 is negative. \u25a1\nWe also have that in the limit t \u2192 0, Tr[D(t)] = \u22122\u03bb\u03071\u2212\u03bb < 0 on account of Eq. (19). Therefore, the Bloch volume measure [14, 42] also is unable to indicate an ENM property.\n7 One might suppose that even though the GAD channel cannot be eternally P-indivisible, it could still be eternally CP-indivisible. Our next result is that even this is ruled out, because the channel must start off as Markovian.\nTheorem 3 A qubit GAD channel that is eternally CP-indivisible is impossible.\nProof: For the qubit GAD channel, the canonical master equation is\n\u03c1\u0307(t) = L[\u03c1(t)]\n= \u03b31(t)[\u03c3\u2212\u03c1(t)\u03c3+ \u2212 1 2{\u03c3+\u03c3\u2212, \u03c1(t)}] + \u03b32(t)[\u03c3+\u03c1(t)\u03c3\u2212 \u2212 1 2{\u03c3\u2212\u03c3+, \u03c1(t)}] (25)\nwhere \u03c3+ = |1\u27e9 \u27e80| and \u03c3\u2212 = |0\u27e9 \u27e81| are the raising and lowering operators. The canonical decay rates are given by:\n\u03b31(t) = \u03bbp\u0307 + \u03bb\u0307p\n1 \u2212 \u03bb,\n\u03b32(t) = \u03bbq\u0307 + \u03bb\u0307q\n1 \u2212 \u03bb, (26)\nwhere p + q = 1. We thus have \u03b31 + \u03b32 = \u03bb\u03071\u2212\u03bb in as much as p\u0307 = \u2212q\u0307. Eqs. (26) entail that\nlim t\u21920+ \u03b31(t) = \u03bb\u0307p,\nlim t\u21920+ \u03b32(t) = \u03bb\u0307(1 \u2212 p). (27)\nIt then follows by virtue of Eqs. (19) and (27), and noting that p is a probability, that limt\u21920+ \u03b3j \u2265 0 (j = 1, 2). \u25a1\nIII. QUASI-ETERNALLY NON-MARKOVIAN GAD CHANNEL\nGiven the impossibility of an ENM qubit GAD channel, the utmost that can be achieved in this direction is quasi-eternal non-Markovianity, whereby one of the rates becomes negative after a finite time t0, and remains negative forever thereafter. The closest approximation to eternal non-Markovianity would then be by letting t0 \u2192 0. An example of this sort is discussed below. To this end, we introduce an eternal \u201cunmixing\u201d effect, i.e., having p\u0307(t) < 0 for all times. In that spirit, in Eq. (18), let\np(t) = e \u2212mt\nn ; \u03bb(t) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bdt (28)\nwhere m, n and \u03bd are some real positive constants. From Eq. (26), we find that\n\u03b31(t) = 1 n\ne\u2212mt ( m ( e\u2212\u03bdt \u2212 1 ) + \u03bd )\n(29a)\n\u03b32(t) = \u03bd \u2212 \u03b31(t) (29b)\n8 are the canonical decay rates, which are plotted in Figure (1) for the values m = 3, n = 2 and \u03bd = 1.\nDecoherence rate \u03b32 remains positive throughout. The initial time when rate \u03b31 turns negative is found using Eq. (29a) to be\nt\u2217 = 1 \u03bd\nlog ( m\nm \u2212 \u03bd\n) . (30)\nNote that since m > \u03bd, thus there is an initial interval given by 0 \u2264 t < t\u2217, during which \u03b31 is necessarily positive. In Eq. (29a), the term (m(e\u2212\u03bdt \u2212 1) + \u03bd) \u2192 \u03bd \u2212 m, in the limit t \u2192 \u221e. Therefore the decay rate approaches 0\u2212, provided m > \u03bd. This provides the condition for the quasi-eternal non-Markovianity of the channel. The symmetry between the two rates is a consequence of Eq. (29b), and more generally, Eq. (26), and is reflected in Figure 1.\nThis channel by design is P-divisible in the sense that the intermediate map F (t, s), according to Eq. (11), is positive at all times and thus will be indicated to be non-Markovian neither by a distinguishability criterion such as trace distance [43], nor by a criterion based on entropic quantities [44]. On the other hand, the occurrence of negative \u03b31 implies that it is CP-indivisible. The non-Markovianity of the channel may be quantified using a measure due to Hall-CresserLi-Anderson [14], which is given by \u03beHCLA := \u2212 \u00b4 t:\u03b3(t)<0 \u03b3(t)dt. In the context of this paper,\n\u03b31(t) < 0 for all t > t\u2217, hence we find that\n\u03beHCLA := \u2212 \u02c6 \u221e\nt\u2217 \u03b31(t)dt\n= \u03bd(\u03bd + m)n\n( \u2212 m\n\u03bd \u2212 m\n)\u2212 \u03bd+m\u03bd . (31)\nwhere t\u2217 is given in by Eq. (30). The HCLA measure is plotted in Fig. (2).\nIV. NON-UNITAL CHANNELS AND ETERNAL NON-MARKOVIANITY\nThe impossibility of ENMity of GAD provokes the question of whether this is generic for all qubit non-unital channels. Yet, a simple example suffices to show that this is not the case. Consider the non-unital channel generated by linearly combining the generators the above Pauli ENM channel and an amplitude damping (AD) channel. An example would be:\nL(\u03c1) = [\u03c3X\u03c1\u03c3X \u2212 \u03c1] + [\u03c3Y \u03c1\u03c3Y \u2212 \u03c1] \u2212 tanh(t)[\u03c3Z\u03c1\u03c3Z \u2212 \u03c1]\n+ \u03b3(t)[\u03c3\u2212\u03c1\u03c3+ \u2212 1 2{\u03c3+\u03c3\u2212, \u03c1}], (32)\nwhere \u03b3(t) is arbitrary decoherence rate for an AD channel. The action of a unital channel leaves the identity operator unchanged, whence \u03c1\u0307 = Lunital(\u03c1) = 0 if \u03c1 \u221d I. The non-unitality of the channel described in Eq. (32) follows, noting that L(I) \u0338= 0. Employing the notation \u03c3\u2213 \u2261 12 (\u03c3X \u00b1 i\u03c3Y ), the above equation can be rewritten as\nL(\u03c1) = \u2211 j,k dj,k(\u03c3j\u03c1\u03c3k \u2212 1 2{\u03c3k\u03c3j , \u03c1}), (33)\n10\nwhere the decoherence matrix d \u2261 {dj,k} [14] is given by\nd = 1 + \u03b32 \u2212i \u03b34 0i \u03b34 1 + \u03b32 0 0 0 \u2212 tanh(t)  (34) The eigenvalues of d, which correspond to the canonical rates, are found to be 1+\u03b3, 1, \u2212 tanh(t). The last eigenvalue obviously entails ENM-ity. Note that this example can be readily extended by using the GAD channel instead of the AD channel.\nRef. [45] points out an example of non-unital ENM channel belonging to the class of phase covariant qubit channels Epc, which are characterized by the property that eiE\u03c3z Epc[\u03c1]e\u2212iE\u03c3z = Epc[eiE\u03c3z \u03c1e\u2212iE\u03c3z ]. The generator has the form Lpc \u2261 \u03b3z(t)[\u03c3z\u03c1\u03c3z \u2212 \u03c1] + \u03b3(t)[\u03c3+\u03c1\u03c3\u2212 \u2212 1 2 {\u03c3\u2212\u03c3+, \u03c1}] + \u03b3(t)[\u03c3\u2212\u03c1\u03c3+ \u2212 1 2 {\u03c3+\u03c3\u2212, \u03c1}], where it can be arranged so that \u03b3z < 0 for all t > 0 [45]. Incidentally, this model was also considered in Ref. [46] in a different context.\nAlthough this settles the question regarding the existence of a purely non-unital ENM channel, this also leads to the observation that in the above mentioned instances, the channel is not purely non-unital, in that the generator in either case can be expressed as a mixture that includes a unital component. Moreover, it is this unital component that introduces the ENM-ity.\nIt could be asked whether this no-go result is specific to two-level systems. It is straightforward to show that these results hold in general to arbitrary finite dimensions, by taking a trivial extension of the qubit dynamics, by embedding the qubit in two dimensions and padding the additional dimensions with an identity operation. This point can be manifestly illustrated by considering another simple way to produce an example of non-unital ENM-ity, namely by combining the Pauli ENM channel with non-unital channels taking recourse to a higher dimensional space. Consider a ququart (4-level quantum system), wherein the \u201clower\u201d two-dimensional subspace, spanned by |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9, is subject to the above Pauli ENM channel, whilst its \u201chigher\u201d two-dimensional subspace, spanned by |2\u27e9 and |3\u27e9, is subject to an AD or GAD channel. In other words, the two parts of the ququart are locally decohered, so that the sum of diagonals is preserved within each subspace and there are no cross-terms in the noise operator across the two subspaces (e.g., |1\u27e9 \u27e82|, etc.). This is mathematically captured by requiring that the generator for the ququart evolution is given by:\nL4 = L01(t) \u2295 L23(t), (35)\nwhere the subscripts to the symbol L denote the subspaces acted upon. Evidently, the ququart as a whole is subject to non-unital noise, which is ENM by virtue of the evolution in first qubit subspace. The resulting map is given is given by\ne \u00b4 t 0 L4(s)ds[\u03c1] = (\nE01 0 0 E23\n) [\u03c1]\n= (\nE01 0 0 I2\n) \u00b7 ( I2 0 0 E23 ) [\u03c1]\n= 3\u2211\nj=1 \u2211 l=1,2 MjNl\u03c1N \u2020 l M \u2020 j (36)\nwhere 0 represents a 2 \u00d7 2 null matrix. Here the Kraus operators Mj for the Pauli channel are obtained by padding an identity operator: Mj = (Ej \u2295 I2), where Ej are given by Eq. (7), In\n11\nparticular, M1 = \u221a 2kI4, and\nM2 =  0 \u221a k 0 0\u221a\nk 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1\n ; M3 =  0 \u2212i \u221a k 0 0 i \u221a\nk 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1  ; The Kraus operators for the AD channel similarly are given by: Nk \u221d (I2 \u2295 Kk), where Kk are the qubit Kraus operators given in Eq. (18), with p:=1.\nN1 =  1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u221a 1 \u2212 \u03bb  ; N2 =  1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 \u221a \u03bb 0 0 0 0  the ququart Kraus operators for the ENM and AD channels, respectively, where k is given by Eq. (8). These diverse examples examined in the Section suggest that a purely non-unital channel (i.e., one lacking any unital component) is impossible. Although we have only studied the qubit case, we conjecture that it is true for non-unital channels in arbitrary finite dimensions.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe ENM Pauli channel [14] presented the rather counter-intuitive idea of a quantum noisy channel that is recoherent for all t > 0. Here we address the question of the possibility of a non-unital channel that is ENM, and show that it is impossible for the well-known class of GAD channels of qubits.\nWe point out that this impossibility of eternal non-Markovianity does not hold for arbitrary non-unital channels. Specifically, as evident from examples discussed above, one can construct an ENM non-unital channel by a linear combination of the generators of an ENM unital channel and an arbitrary non-unital one. However, we conjecture that for a non-unital channel with no such unital component (in the above sense) to be ENM, is impossible.\nA consequence of our above negative result is that the best that a qubit GAD channel can approach the ENM property is to be non-Markovian for all times above a non-zero threshold time t\u2217, i.e., strictly t\u2217 > 0. By way of illustration, we provided an example of a \u201cquasi-ENM\u201d GAD channel, which is non-Markovian for all time t \u2265 t\u2217 > 0."
