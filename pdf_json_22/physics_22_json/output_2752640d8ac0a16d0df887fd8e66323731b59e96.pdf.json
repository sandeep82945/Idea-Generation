    "abstractText": "A growing number of debris discs have been detected around metal-polluted white dwarfs. They are thought to be originated from tidally disrupted exoplanetary bodies and responsible for metal accretion onto host WDs. To explain (1) the observationally inferred accretion rate higher than that induced by Poynting-Robertson drag, \u00a4 MPR, and (2) refractory-rich photosphere composition indicating the accretion of terrestrial rocky materials, previous studies proposed runaway accretion of silicate particles due to gas drag by the increasing silicate vapor produced by the sublimation of the particles. Because re-condensation of the vapor diffused beyond the sublimation line was neglected, we revisit this problem by one-dimensional advection/diffusion simulation that consistently incorporates silicate sublimation/condensation and back-reaction to particle drift due to gas drag in the solid-rich disc. We find that the silicate vapor density in the region overlapping the solid particles follows the saturating vapor pressure and that no runaway accretion occurs if the re-condensation is included. This always limits the accretion rate from mono-compositional silicate discs to \u00a4 MPR in the equilibrium state. Alternatively, by performing additional simulations that couple the volatile gas (e.g., water vapor), we demonstrate that the volatile gas enhances the silicate accretion to > \u00a4 MPR through gas drag. The refractory-rich accretion is simultaneously reproduced when the initial volatile fraction of disc is < \u223c 10 wt% because of the suppression of volatile accretion due to the efficient back-reaction of solid to gas. The discs originating from C-type asteroid analogs might be a possible clue to the high\u00a4 M puzzle.",

            "text": "A growing number of observations show the universal presence of planetary materials in and around white dwarfs (WDs). From a quarter to a half of WDs have metals such as Fe, Si, O, and C in their atmospheres (e.g., Zuckerman et al. 2003, 2010; Koester et al. 2014; Hollands et al. 2017). Some of them show infrared excess from their circumstellar dusty discs (Zuckerman & Becklin 1987; Jura et al. 2007; Rocchetto et al. 2015), and a few of them exhibit double-peaked emission lines (G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2006, 2007; Melis et al. 2010; Manser et al. 2016) or Doppler-broadened absorption lines (Xu et al. 2016; Steele et al. 2021) from the circumstellar gas. These are thought to be originated from the remnant planetary systems around WDs which evolve with their host stars\u2019 post-main sequence evolution. The surviving asteroids and/or minor planets could be gravitationally scattered into star-grazing orbits (Debes & Sigurdsson 2002; Bonsor et al. 2011; Mustill et al. 2018), and the tidal disruption and subsequent collisions of the fragments generated by the disruption is likely to eventually produce compact dusty accretion discs (e.g., Jura 2003). Based on this scenario, an accretion disc can play a crucial role\n\u2605 E-mail: ayaka.okuya@nao.ac.jp\nto link such observations to accreted bodies as well as their origin. Moreover, to reconcile the short sinking timescale of heavier elements in the WD atmosphere due to the strong gravitationally field (Paquette et al. 1986; Koester 2010) with the universal metal detection, the continuous accretion of heavy elements from the circumstellar disc would be more likely rather than intermittent accretion such as the direct hitting of planetary bodies onto WDs. The observed spectral energy distributions (Jura et al. 2007, 2009) show that the dust emission from the disc extends from 10-40 stellar radius out to the Roche limit radius (\ud835\udc5fR). The outer edge at \u223c \ud835\udc5fR is consistent with a tidally disrupted disc. The inner disc radius may correspond to the silicate sublimation line, suggesting that the particles1 in the disc are silicate debris particles of \ud835\udf07m\u2013cm sizes\n1 In this paper, we refer to silicate dust/solid particles as dust, particles, solid, or their combinations, and to gaseous components produced by sublimation of solid particles as gas or vapor. The different words do not represent different meanings, but reflect the context. For example, solid and vapor when considering phase change through sublimation/condensation, gas and dust/particles when describing their physical dynamics, and dust is also used when concerned with observations. Following the conventional notation, we also adopt the abbreviations \u201cd\u201d (dust) and \u201cg\u201d (gas) for the subscripts for physical quantities.\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n16 79\n7v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .E\nP] 3\n0 N\nov 2\n(Graham et al. 1990; Jura et al. 2009) and a silicate vapor disc would be connected with the particle disc at its inner edge and be distributed toward the stellar surface (Rafikov 2011a; Metzger et al. 2012). The connected silicate vapor disc is observationally supported by the detection of metal emission lines (e.g., G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2006; Manser et al. 2016). The observations also show that the vapor and the particles spatially overlap (Brinkworth et al. 2009; Melis et al. 2010). The observationally inferred disc accretion rate onto the host star is 106\u22121011 g/s (Farihi et al. 2009, 2010; Chen et al. 2019). Because the outer disc is likely to consist of solid debris particle and it provides accreting vapor to the inner disc, it is important to clarify the inward transportmechanismof the debris. ThePoyntingRobertson (PR) drag is a promising mechanism in the strong WD radiation field (Rafikov 2011b; Bochkarev & Rafikov 2011). However, as the accretion rate driven by PR-drag increases, the disc becomes optically thick and the WD radiation received by individual solid particles deceases. As a result, the accretion rate does not increase over \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick \u223c 108 g/s, once the disc becomes optically thick (Rafikov 2011b, see also section 2), and therefore the higher observed accretion rate of 108\u22121011 g/s, which WDs with discs typically have (Jura et al. 2007; Farihi et al. 2009), cannot be explained. The observed metal abundance in the WD atmospheres so far suggests that the vast majority of WDs accrete materials with terrestrial rocky composition: Rock-forming refractories such as Fe, Mg, Si, and O are commonly detected, and they comprise at least 85% by mass of polluting materials (Jura & Young 2014). On the other hand, the detection of volatile elements such as C, N, and S are currently very rare (Xu et al. 2017). The deficient pattern of these elements resembles dry rocky bodies in the solar systems (G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2012; Jura & Young 2014). In addition, Ca and other refractories are detected in the gas disc emission line in several systems whereas volatiles such as H and O has been observed in only one system (Gentile Fusillo et al. 2021). While a few ideas are suggested to account for the higher observed accretion rates than \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick (Jura 2008; Farihi et al. 2012), Rafikov (2011a) andMetzger et al. (2012) proposed a detailed idea in the framework of debris particle drift by PR-drag that the silicate particle drift is accelerated by gas drag from the silicate vapor produced by sublimation of the particle at the location with the silicate sublimation temperature (the silicate line). The produced vapor viscously spreads outward to interact with the particles beyond the silicate line. Because of the differential rotation between vapor and particles due to radial pressure gradient in the vapor disc, the particles lose angular momentum by gas drag (Adachi et al. 1976). The acceleration of the particle drift enhances the sublimation and therefore the gas drag. By this positive feedback, the drift by gas drag becomes faster than that by PR-drag, and the accretion rate increases in a runaway fashion until the particles are completely depleted (Metzger et al. 2012, see Appendix A for the detailed model description). Metzger et al. (2012) found that their simulations with the runaway accretion successfully account for (1) the higher accretion rate that cannot be obtained by PR drag alone and (2) the photospheric composition polluted by rocky materials. The essential point of the runaway accretion model by Metzger et al. (2012) is the co-existence of the silicate vapor and particles. They discussed the potential importance of re-condensation of the vapor diffused outward because the characteristic condensation timescale may be short enough to suppress the runaway accretion. However, because the overlapping of the vapor and the particle distributions is suggested by the observations, Metzger et al. (2012) neglected the vapor re-condensation.\nIn this paper, we revisit the high disc accretion rate onto WDs by 1D advection/diffusion simulation with more sophisticate sublimation/condensation calculation using the phase change rate as a function of vapor and the saturation pressures, following Hyodo et al. (2019, 2021). Because the vapor can exist only up to the saturation pressure beyond the silicate line,we show in this paper that the silicate vapor and particle distributions hardly overlap at the disc mid-plane and that the runaway accretion is significantly suppressed in the case of a single component (silicate), as Metzger et al. (2012) pointed out its possibility. As the condensation effect is the most significant for the accretion rate, the runaway accretion would be inhibited independently of the detailed treatments of solid-gas interaction (see Sec. 3.2). However, the possibility remains that the acceleration of the silicate particle drift is induced by the vapor of more volatile materials. Dynamical arguments allow the supply of solid bodies from the wide range of orbital radii, such as Main Asteroid Belt analogs to Kuiper-Belt analogs (Mustill et al. 2018; Li et al. 2022). This means that, although volatile detection has been currently rare in the WD atmospheres and/or disc emission lines, the delivery of ice-bearing bodies could be quite possible and they would form volatile-bearing accretion discs. The Main Asteroid Belt analog may supply not only the dry S-type asteroids but also C-type asteroids which marginally include water of \u223c 10 wt%, into the Roche limit radius. Because of a longer Keplerian timescale for a larger orbital radius, KuiperBelt analogs in outer regions can be massive reservoirs of the source of the pollution (Bonsor & Wyatt 2010). Although the probability that the planetary bodies of an outer system can be gravitationally scattered onto star-grazing orbits highly depends on the distribution of an inner planetary system (Bonsor et al. 2011), the infall of KuiperBelt analogs would deliver the approximately same amount of water as the rock components. Accordingly, we also perform additional simulations that include volatile vapor (e.g., water vapor) produced by icy components of the debris. For the circumstellar discs around WDs, the snow line would be much farther than the Roche limit radius (see Figure 1). The icy components would be sublimated immediately after tidal capture/disruption. Because the water vapor does not condense in the region overlapping the silicate particles, it enhances the silicate accretion through gas drag, naturally covering the observational range of the accretion rates, for example, by changing the water vapor density. The accretion from volatile-including discs seems to contradict the observed photospheric composition. However, the back-reaction forces of dust to gas can potentially mitigate the contradiction. While silicate particles lose their angular momentum due to gas drag to drift to the central star, volatile vapor receives angular momentum from the solid particles as a back reaction and moves outward (e.g., Nakagawa et al. 1986; Kanagawa et al. 2017). In addition, the volatile vapor beyond the snow line would condense into icy particles. If the drift of icy particles is slow, they may remain as a solid icy ring and become a reservoir of infalling volatile materials. We investigate the possibility that volatile-bearing discs can produce not only a high accretion rate but also accretion mass with silicate-rich compositions through these processes of disc evolution. The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the silicate disc model that solves the coupled evolution of silicate dust and vapor discs and our numerical settings. In Section 3, we present the evolution and accretion rates of one-component silicate discs to identify the effects of condensation. In Section 4, we clarify the impacts of volatile vapor on the silicate disc evolution and demonstrate the possible condition for reproducing a higher range\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nof observational rates and silicate-rich photospheric composition. In Section 5, we compare our simulation results with gas disc observations and elemental fraction observed in the photospheres to discuss their consistency. We summarize our findings in Section 6."

            "text": "The silicate particle disc around a WD would be a compact disc extending from the silicate sublimation line to the Roche limit. Figure 1 schematically shows the geometry of the modeled disc. For materials with an internal density of \ud835\udf0cint, orbiting a WD of physical radius \ud835\udc45WD, mass \ud835\udc40WD, and mean density \ud835\udf0cWD, the Roche limit radius is given by\n\ud835\udc5fR = \ud835\udc36R ( \ud835\udf0cWD \ud835\udf0cint )1/3 \ud835\udc45WD (1)\n\u223c 1.3 \ud835\udc45 ( \ud835\udc40WD 0.6\ud835\udc40 )1/3 ( \ud835\udf0cint 3 g cm\u22123 )\u22121/3 , (2)\nwhere we assume \ud835\udc36R = 2.0 (van Lieshout et al. 2018) and adopt \ud835\udf0cint = 3 g cm\u22123 for rocky materials. We adopt \ud835\udc40WD = 0.6\ud835\udc40 and \ud835\udc45WD = 0.01 \ud835\udc45 , which are the typical values for the metal-polluted WDs. As the silicate particles approach the sublimation line, silicate vapor is produced by the particle sublimationwithout background gas such as H and He. We solve the sublimation and condensation rates of silicates based on the saturation pressure (\ud835\udc43eq) and the local vapor pressure (\ud835\udc43g) in the disc (see sec. 2.2). As sublimation proceeds, the sublimation line radius (\ud835\udc5fsil), at which \ud835\udc43eq = \ud835\udc43g, evolves. Typically, \ud835\udc5fsil \u223c 0.1 \ud835\udc45 (see sec 3.2), where the disc temperature is \u223c 2000K (Eq. 3). This is considerably higher than the typical sublimation temperature used for silicates in protoplanetary discs, because in the disc around a WD that consists only of silicate vapor, the vapor pressure is much higher than the partial pressure of silicates in the protoplanetary discs. Such high sublimation temperature is consistent with the estimate by Rafikov & Garmilla (2012) based on vapor pressure. In this paper, we adopt the temperature determined by direct irradiation from the WD with the photosphere temperature of 10000 K as (Rafikov & Garmilla 2012)\n\ud835\udc47 = 620 ( \ud835\udc45WD 0.01\ud835\udc45 )1/2 ( \ud835\udc47WD 10000 K ) ( \ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc5fR\n)\u22121/2 K. (3)\nBecause the luminosity of WDs is high, the contribution of the viscous heating is negligible compared to the stellar irradiation. Adopting the isothermal sound speed, \ud835\udc50s = \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47/\ud835\udf07g with themeanmolecular weight \ud835\udf07g = 30 \ud835\udc5ap corresponding to Mg-SiO gas, where \ud835\udc58B is the Boltzmann constant and \ud835\udc5ap is the proton mass, the gas scale height for Eq. (3) is given by\n\ud835\udc3bg = \ud835\udc50s\u03a9 \u22121 \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123\n( \ud835\udc5f\n1\ud835\udc45\n)1/4 \ud835\udc5f, (4)\nwhere\u03a9 is the Keplerian orbital frequency. The disc is geometrically very thin;\ud835\udc3bg at the Roche limit of\u223c 1\ud835\udc45 is one tenth of theWD stellar radius, and the dust scale height is smaller than \ud835\udc3bg (see Eq. (23)). For this disc geometry, the surface of an optically thick region is illuminated by the host star at an incident angle of (Friedjung 1985),\n\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc5f) = 4 3\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc45WD \ud835\udc5f , (5)\nwhich is used for the calculation of Poynting-Roberton drag (e.g., Rafikov 2011b, see also sec 2.5). The disc which formed from solid minor planets would initially have the gas surface density significantly lower than the dust particle surface density. In such particle-dominated environments, particlegas interaction such as gas drag is affected by surrounding other particles. Metzger et al. (2012) approximated the midplane particle layer as a solid plate and modeled the gas-drag force as a force exerted between the solid plate surface and the layer of gas above and below it. On the other hand, our model assumes that each particle experience the gas drag from the gas phase individually but takes into account the particle collective effects by including the backreaction of dust. They are based on different physics approaches, but we show that mass accretion rate predicted by each gas-drag formulation possibly shares a similar dependence (Sec. 2.5), resulting in the approximately same disc evolution (Sec. 3). Furthermore, the particle-based approach enables us to self-consistently incorporate the sublimation/condensation calculation into advection/diffusion model (Sec. 2.2.)"

(2019, 2021) simulated radially one-dimensional advection and diffusion of pebbles of ice-rockmixture with sublimation/recondensation of water ices near the snow line in a turbulent H-He gas protoplanetary disc to discuss pile-ups of the silicate dust particles released from the pebbles inside the snow line and the pebbles outside the snow line for the formation of rocky and icy planetesimals. We follow their simulation methods, but with no background H-He gas, replacing the icy pebbles near the snow line by the silicate particles near the silicate line, and adding the drift of the silicate particles due to PR-drag. As we already mentioned, including re-condensation of silicate vapor in a self-consistent way is the most important difference from previous studies on the WD disc evolution (Bochkarev & Rafikov 2011; Metzger et al. 2012). We follow Schoonenberg & Ormel (2017) and Hyodo et al. (2019) for prescriptions of sublimation/re-condensation of silicates. Macroscopic sublimation/re-condensation is regulated by adsorption of molecules in the gas phase to solid silicate particles and desorption of molecules from the particles to gas. The former and latter rates are respectively represented by the partial vapor pressure \ud835\udc43silg and saturation pressure \ud835\udc43eq. The local (partial) pressure of silicate vapor with surface density \u03a3silg and temperature \ud835\udc47 is given by\n\ud835\udc43silg = \u03a3silg\u221a 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc3bg \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udf07sil , (6)\nwhere \ud835\udf07sil = 30 \ud835\udc5ap for Mg-SiO gas.

(7)\nAssuming crystalline foresterite (Mg2SiO4) for a representative of silicate, we take values of A = 65309 [K] and B = 34.1 (Nagahara et al. 1994). The mass change rate of a spherical solid particle with mass \ud835\udc5ad is given by (Lichtenegger & Komle 1991; Ciesla & Cuzzi 2006; Rafikov & Garmilla 2012)\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5ad \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = 4\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f2d\ud835\udf10th\ud835\udf0cd\n( 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc43eq\n\ud835\udc43silg\n) , (8)\nwhere \ud835\udc5fd is the physical radius of the particle, \ud835\udf10th = \u221a\ufe01 8/\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 is the\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nmean thermal velocity, and \ud835\udf0cd is the spatial density of silicate dust particles. The location at \ud835\udc43eq = \ud835\udc43silg is called the sublimation line (the silicate line in our case). Because \ud835\udc47 decreases with increasing \ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc43eq is sensitive to \ud835\udc47 , the dependence of the silicate line radius on \ud835\udc43silg is weak. The vapor, diffused out to the region beyond the silicate line where \ud835\udc43eq < \ud835\udc43silg , re-condenseswith the rate corresponding to Eq. (8) as follows. The surface density change rate of solid particles due to sublimation/re-condensation, which will be used as the source/sink term in Eq. (13), is given by\n\u00a4\u03a3d = (\ud835\udc45con\u03a3silg \u2212 \ud835\udc45eva)\u03a3d, (9)\nwhere \ud835\udc45con and \ud835\udc45eva are\n\ud835\udc45con = 2\n\u221a\ufe04 \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udf07sil \ud835\udc5f2d \ud835\udc5ad\ud835\udc3bg , (10)\n\ud835\udc45eva = 2 \u221a 2\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc5f2d \ud835\udc5ad \u221a\ufe02 \ud835\udf07sil \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc43eq. (11)\nThe vapor surface density change rate is \u00a4\u03a3silg = \u2212 \u00a4\u03a3d by the conservation of mass. In the plate-based model, we adopt the same condensation formulation but modify \u00a4\u03a3d (Eq. 9) taking into account the limited surface area as follows: While Eq. 9 assumes that each particle interacts with the gas phase individually and act as a condensation nucleus, the surface area where particles and gas phase can contact each other may be limited to the surfaces of the solid plate in the plate-based approximation.We thusmodify \u00a4\u03a3d, onlywhen calculating the change rate due to condensation, by multiplying \u00a4\u03a3d by the correction factor given by\n\ud835\udc36cond = min\n( 1,\n\ud835\udc46plate \ud835\udc46particle = 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\n4\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f2d\ud835\udc41d (\ud835\udc5f)2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\n) , (12)\nwhere \ud835\udc46plate/\ud835\udc46particle is the ratio of plate surface area to the summation of surface area for individual particles, and \ud835\udc41d (\ud835\udc5f) is the number\ndensity of silicate dust particles. This diminishes \u00a4\u03a3d, inhibiting the vapor from re-condensing immediately outside the silicate line."

In general, the vapor surface density distribution inside the sublimation line tends to relax to steady state with \ud835\udc5e = 1 and \u00a4\ud835\udc40g = \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR, while the static distribution with \ud835\udc5e = 3/2 tends to extend beyond the sublimation line (for details, see Okamoto & Ida (2022)). We note that if the positive feed-back is strong enough, the steady accretion is not established and the distribution is time dependent. As we will show later, the re-condensation effect maintains the distribution beyond the sublimation line steeper than \ud835\udc5e = 3/2, even in the case of steady accretion."

The first and second terms in \ud835\udf10GD represent the drift relative to disc gas radial motion due to angular momentum loss by gas drag and the drift dragged by the disc gas radial motion, respectively. Assuming the equation of state for ideal gas, \ud835\udc43allg \u221d \ud835\udf0cg\ud835\udc47 \u221d \u03a3allg \ud835\udc47/\ud835\udc3bg, and \ud835\udc47 \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22121/2,\n\ud835\udf15 ln \ud835\udc43allg \ud835\udf15 ln \ud835\udc5f = \u2212(\ud835\udc5e + 7/4). (21)\nUsing this relation and Eq. (16), Eq. (19) is written as\n\ud835\udf10GD = \u2212 (\ud835\udc3bg/\ud835\udc5f)2\nSt2 + (1 + \ud835\udc4d)2 [( \ud835\udc5e + 7 4 ) St + (1 + \ud835\udc4d) ( \u22123\ud835\udc5e + 9 2 ) \ud835\udefc ] \ud835\udf10K.\n(22)\nIn the previous treatments in protoplanetary disc studies (Hyodo et al. 2019, 2021), the back-reaction of the dust particle concentration is represented by the midplane dust-to-gas density, \ud835\udc4d = \ud835\udf0cd/\ud835\udf0cg. This\ncorresponds to the limit where the angular momentum is exchanged between dust and gas only within the dust particle scale height, \ud835\udc3bd. The dust particle scale height is given by\n\ud835\udc3bd = \ud835\udc3bg\n\u221a\ufe02 \ud835\udefc\nSt + \ud835\udefc , (23)\nwhere \ud835\udc3bg is given by Eq. (4), \ud835\udefc is the turbulent parameter for diffusion. On the other hand, if the vertical turbulence of gas is no less effective than viscous diffusion (e.g., \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc67 >\u223c\ud835\udefcacc), it transports and mixes the angular momentum from dust particles to the upper gas layer. In that case, \ud835\udc4d can be rewritten as\n\ud835\udc4d = \u222b \ud835\udc3bE \u2212\ud835\udc3bE \ud835\udf0cd (\ud835\udc67) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc67\u222b \ud835\udc3bE \u2212\ud835\udc3bE \ud835\udf0cg (\ud835\udc67) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc67 , (24)\nwhere we represent the vertical thickness of the gas layer that can exchange angular momentumwith dust particles as\ud835\udc3bE. Although the exact value of \ud835\udc3bE is uncertain, we assume in this paper, that velocity shear is restricted within to the Ekman layer of vertical thickness (Metzger et al. 2012), \ud835\udc3bE \u223c (\ud835\udf08/\u03a9)1/2 \u223c 0.03(\ud835\udefc/10\u22123)1/2\ud835\udc3bg2. The vertical thickness of \ud835\udc3bE determines the efficiency of the angular momentum exchange and significantly affects the behavior of the volatile gas disc through the back-reaction of dust to gas (Sec. 4). Nevertheless, as shown later, our drift velocity formula has similar dependence to that derived byMetzger et al. (2012) as long as \ud835\udc4d > St and \ud835\udc4d 1, which is the case in most of our runs and choice of \ud835\udc3bE. When \ud835\udc3bE > \ud835\udc3bd, Equation (24) is given by\n\ud835\udc4d ' \u03a3d \ud835\udc53\u03a3allg\n(25)\nwhere \ud835\udc53 \u2261 min ( 1, \ud835\udc3bE \ud835\udc3bg ) ' min [ 1, 0.03 ( \ud835\udefc 10\u22123 )] . (26)\nAswe show below, this prescriptionmakes the silicatemass accretion rate onto the star independent of the vertical structure of the solid disc, which may be consistent with Metzger et al. (2012). In our simulation, St is generally > 1, so that \ud835\udc3bd <\u223c\ud835\udc3bE < \ud835\udc3bg (Eq. 23). Note that the settling due to the particle collision and back-reaction of dust to vertical turbulent diffusion is neglected in our model. However, since the silicate accretion rate is regulated by \ud835\udc3bE but not by \ud835\udc3bd in our prescription, this neglect does not affect the results. Equation (22) shows that for St > (1+\ud835\udc4d)\ud835\udefc, the radial drift relative to gas motion dominates over that associated with the disc gas accretion. The maximum drift velocity is ' \u2212\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf10K at St \u223c 1 and \ud835\udc4d 1. For \ud835\udc3bg given by Eq.

In our calculations, \ud835\udc5fd \u223c \ud835\udf06mfp and dust particles experience the Epstein drag or Stokes drag, depending on \ud835\udc5f and the evolution of \u03a3allg .

However, for \ud835\udc4d > St, the back-reaction alters the dependence. The relation \ud835\udc4d > St holds for almost all solid-enriched regions in our simulations. In particular, the radial drift relative to gas motion dominates over that associated with the disc gas accretion, for St > (1 + \ud835\udc4d)\ud835\udefc, \ud835\udc36St\u2212Z \u223c (\ud835\udc5e + 7/4)St/\ud835\udc4d2.

The difference mainly comes from the uncertainty related to the coupling strength between solid and gas-phase in each model, but they take close values in the numerical simulations in Sec. 3.1 and Sec.

To avoid such extremely short timesteps, we combine the analytic timestep scheme developed by Matsuura et al. (in prep.) based on Clark (1973) for the calculation of source/sink term due to sublimation and condensation. When using the analytic timestep scheme, we have confirmed that the total mass of gas and dust particles is conserved.

The value is typical for observationally inferred rocky mass accreted onto WDs (Farihi et al. 2010). In Sec. 4, we vary \u03a3d0 to study the dependence of accretion rate on the silicate to volatile vapor mass ratio for the volatile-rich disc. For the primary purpose of investigating the disc evolution, we simply assume that all particles initially have \ud835\udc5fd = 0.1 or 1 cm for most of the calculations in this study. Graham et al.

(19). We adopt \ud835\udc5fd = 0.1 cm and \ud835\udc53 = 0.1. Figure 2 schematically shows the surface density evolution of solid and vapor until \ud835\udc61 = 6000 years. As dust particles approach the silicate sublimation line, silicate vapor is produced. Inside the sublimation line, only the vapor disc is present, because the sublimation timescale is much shorter than the particle drift timescale. The produced vapor diffuses inward to establish the steady accretion with \u03a3g \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22121 and also diffuses outward to expand with \u03a3g \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22123/2 in an inside-out manner (diffusion timescale is \u221d \ud835\udc5f). However, this is a quasi-steady/static state and \u03a3g secularly increases with time as a whole, as shown in Fig. 3. Outside the silicate line, solid and vapor discs co-exist, and especially at \ud835\udc61 > 3 \u00d7 103 years, the inward drift of the silicate particles is accelerated due to increasing \u03a3g. As we already pointed out, this acceleration is common to plate drag regime (Eq. 37) and indispensable for the runaway accretion. Since the back-reaction is so effective that \ud835\udc4d > St and the gas-drag-drift governs the silicate dust accretion (i.e., \ud835\udc4d < St/\ud835\udefc) at the inner edge of optically thick region (\ud835\udc5f \u223c 0.3\ud835\udc45 ), the silicate accretion flux follows Eq. (35) to increase with the increase of \u03a3g. Once the \u03a3silg exceeds a critical value such that \ud835\udf10GD > \ud835\udf10PR, all solid particles rapidly drift into the sublimation line. The positive feedback between the drag force and \u03a3g secularly increases \u00a4\ud835\udc40acc with time (Fig. 4), resulting in the runaway accretion at \ud835\udc61 & 2 \u00d7 104 years. At this time, the gas drag is so efficient that the sublimation supplies gas near the silicate line faster than viscous diffusion to remove the gas (Rafikov 2011a; Metzger et al. 2012). Figure 4 also shows the evolution of accretion rate with various \ud835\udc5fd and \ud835\udc53 . Although the onset timing of runaway accretion and the presence/absence of plateau depend on the parameter choice, all of the peak values of \u00a4\ud835\udc40acc are orders of magnitude higher than the rate that can be achieved by PR drag alone. In Appendix A, we perform the same setting simulation as Metzger et al. (2012) by using the gas-drag-drift formula of Eq. (40) to reproduce their results of the surface density evolution (Fig. A1) and the accretion rate evolution (Fig. A2). The runaway accretion process shown in these results is qualitatively reproduced by our simulations with the particle drag prescription. The dust surface density distributions are different between our results and the reproduction results of Metzger et al. (2012) due to the different gas-drag drift velocity of dust particles, but the overall evolution trend is common. In the next section, by simulations with condensation, we will show that the effect of re-condensation of silicate vapor totally suppresses the runway accretion in the case of silicate one-component discs."

(2012)\u2019s plate-based disc model, respectively. In both\ncases, the suppression of the runaway accretion is caused by condensation. Using the drag force calculated from the summation of drag forces for individual particles with back-reaction through the dependence on \ud835\udc4d (Eq. 19), we perform the disc evolution simulation with turning on the condensation. Figure 5 shows physical quantities which characterize disc structures in our fiducial simulation. Compared with the result with turning off the condensation (Fig. 3), \u03a3silg is much smaller both inside and outside the silicate line (Fig. 5a). Outside the silicate line, \u03a3silg (the silicate vapor surface density) decreases with \ud835\udc5f much rapidly. As we already pointed out, the re-condensation timescale is significantly shorter than the radial diffusion timescale, so that \u03a3silg outside the silicate line is almost completely determined by the saturation pressure (\ud835\udc43eq) given by Eq. (7). The smaller \u03a3silg also results in\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\n\ud835\udc4d > 104 (solid dominated)5 and St > 104 (weak coupling) as shown in Fig. 5c. The high \ud835\udc4d and St imply lower \ud835\udf10GD due to the gas drag from the vapor (Eq. 19). The solid particle mass flux provided from the Gaussian ring is always limited by that due to the optically-thick limit of PR drag (Fig. 5e), resulting in one to two orders of magnitude lower \u03a3silg inside the silicate line. Therefore, runaway accretion never occurs. The re-condensation of silicate vapor generates a recycling flow structure at the silicate line, which never appears in the simulations with tuning off condensation, as follows: Because the saturation vapor pressure produces a sharp negative gradient in \u03a3silg outside the sublimation line, \ud835\udf10g takes positive values (outward flow) locally as shown in Fig. 5d. From Eqs. (7) with \ud835\udc47 \u223c 2000 (\ud835\udc5f/\ud835\udc5fsil)\u22121/2 K and Eq.

(16), we estimate \ud835\udf10g \u223c 2 cm/s, which explains the magnitude of the outward flow in Fig. 5d. The outwardly diffused vapor immediately re-condenses if the partial pressure exceeds the saturation pressure. This grows silicate particle size in the vicinity of the silicate line (Fig. 5b). However, the recondensed particles drift back to the silicate line due to the gas drag from the silicate vapor in addition to PR-drag, which provides the solid particle mass flux in excess of \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick in the vicinity of the silicate line. As a result, the accretion flux of silicate vapor is equal to the mass flux of solid particles flowing into the silicate line (Fig. 5e). Once a steady state without runaway accretion is established, the accretion rate onto the WD is simply equal to that caused by the PR drag alone, \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick (Figure. 6).

(35).\ncreases due to repeated sublimation and re-condensation, and the PR-drag slows down in proportion to \ud835\udf0fd. The above arguments to explain the accretion rate obtained by our full disc model is almost independent of the disc parameters, \ud835\udc5fd and \ud835\udc53 . Figure. 6 shows the results with various \ud835\udc5fd and \ud835\udc53 obtained by our particle-based disc model including condensation. We stress that, in our full disc model, the condensation suppresses the runaway accretion even with the parameters which cause intense runaway accretion in the simulation by turning off the condensation (e.g., \ud835\udc5fd= 1 cm and \ud835\udc53 = 0.1 in Fig. 4). The accretion rate converges to \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick for all parameters. In addition, as \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick is independent of \u03a3d (Eq. 49), \u00a4\ud835\udc40acc does not increase even as the increase of silicate disc mass. We also perform the simulation by adding the condensation effects to the plate-based model that Metzger et al. (2012) adopted. We use the gas-drag drift velocity derived from the gas-drag force between the solid plate surface and the layer of gas (Eq .40). Furthermore, we modify the surface density change rate due to condensation by multiplying the correction factor, \ud835\udc36cond \u2264 1, in Eq. (12). Figure 7 shows the accretion rate with various \ud835\udc5fd obtained by the plate-based disc model turning on and off the condensation, respectively. We choose \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\u2217 = 0.3 so that the sufficiently strong gassolid feedback can cause the runaway accretion for all parameters (for details, see (Metzger et al. 2012)). Nevertheless, we find that the accretion rate in the runs with turning on the condensation is limited to \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR for all parameters. Even if we adopt \ud835\udf10GD derived by the drag force formula in the solid plate approximation (Eq. 40), the condensation completely halts the runaway accretion. In addition, the correction of condensation surface area gives a negligible impact on the results because the time scale of condensation is still several orders of magnitude shorter than those of vapor diffusion."

In this section, we investigate the effects of the volatile vapor such aswater vapor that does not undergo condensation in the regionwhere silicate particles are distributed.

In particular, we focus on (1) the possibility to provide a higher range of observed accretion rates due to gas drag from volatile vapor. We also study (2) whether such a high accretion rate can reproduce rock-rich photospheric composition or not. In the results part, we present both the evolution of instantaneous accretion rate and accumulated accretion mass.

On the other hand, for the longer \ud835\udc61sink, the time-integrated accretion mass would be a representative of the photospheric composition. The former would apply to WDs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres (DA-type), which typically have \ud835\udc61sink of 1 day to 104 year (Paquette et al. 1986; Koester 2009).

The governing equation of the surface density of volatile vapor, \u03a3volg , is given by (Desch et al. 2017)\n\ud835\udf15\u03a3volg \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc61 + 1 \ud835\udc5f \ud835\udf15 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc5f ( \ud835\udc5f\u03a3volg \ud835\udf10g \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc37g\u03a3allg \ud835\udf15 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc5f (\u03a3volg \u03a3allg )) = \u2212 \u00a4\u03a3vold , (56)\nwhere \ud835\udc37g is the diffusivity of gas given by Eq. (50), \ud835\udf10g is the radial advection velocity of the gas, and \u00a4\u03a3vold represents the phase change (sublimation/condensation) rate of solid icy particles. The latter two will be described below. In Equation (56), the total surface density of gaseous components is \u03a3allg = \u03a3silg + \u03a3volg , where time-dependent \u03a3silg and \u03a3volg are calculated from Eqs. (14) and (56), respectively. The back-reaction forces that the silicate particles collectivelywork on the gasmodify the gas advection velocity as follows: In the vertical thickness within the angular momentum of dust particles can be transmitted, |\ud835\udc67 | < \ud835\udc3bE (see Sec. 2.5), the radial gas velocity taking into account both back-reaction of dust and gas viscosity is formulated as (Ida & Guillot 2016; Schoonenberg & Ormel 2017; Hyodo et al. 2021)\n\ud835\udf10g,BK = 2St\ud835\udc4d \ud835\udf02 \ud835\udf10K St2 + (1 + \ud835\udc4d)2 + [ 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc4d (1 + \ud835\udc4d) St2 + (1 + \ud835\udc4d)2 ] \ud835\udf10g,\ud835\udf08 , (57)\nwhere St is the Stokes number of silicate solid particles (see the definition in sec. 2.5) and \ud835\udf02 is given by Eq. (20). The first term in the above equation represents the outward flow of the gas resulting from the gain of the angular momentum that the silicate particles lose. In Eq. (57), while the previous works on protoplanetary discs have adopted the mid-plane dust-to-gas density ratio, we apply dust-to-gas density within \ud835\udc3bE defined by Eq. (24) to correspond to our gas-drag drift formula of dust particles in Eq. (19). In the upper layers above \ud835\udc3bE, as the gas may not be affected by the dust back-reaction forces, it would advect with unperturbed velocity, \ud835\udf10g,\ud835\udf08 (Eq. 16). Therefore, vertically averaging the above velocities,\n\ud835\udf10g = \ud835\udf10g,BK\ud835\udc3bE + \ud835\udf10g,\ud835\udf08 (\ud835\udc3bg \u2212 \ud835\udc3bE)\n\ud835\udc3bg . (58)\nWe adopt the same \ud835\udf10g for the silicate vapor and the volatile vapor assuming they are well mixed in a sufficiently short time scale. We caution that the approximation of \ud835\udc3bE by the thickness of the Ekman layer is uncertain (see Sec. 2.5). Our adopted \ud835\udc3bE value results in much stronger effects of back-reaction of dust to gas than in Metzger et al. (2012), as described in Fig. 8a and Sec. 4.3. Exact estimation of the vertical thickness of the gas layer interacting with dust particles, \ud835\udc3bE, is left for future work. Assuming water vapor for a representative of volatile vapor, we adopt themolecular weight, \ud835\udf07vol = 18\ud835\udc5aH for the volatile vapor in this paper, where \ud835\udc5aH is the proton mass. Inside the silicate sublimation line, silicate vapor of \ud835\udf07sil = 30\ud835\udc5aH is added to the water vapor disc. This means the mean molecular weight \ud835\udf07 of the gas disc increases from that of the pure volatile vapor disc. In such two-component mixed gas, we calculate \ud835\udf07 as 1 \ud835\udf07 = \ud835\udc53vol \ud835\udf07vol + \ud835\udc53sil \ud835\udf07sil , (59)\nwhere \ud835\udc53vol is the mass fraction of volatile vapor in the total gaseous components, and \ud835\udc53sil is the mass fraction of silicate vapor. The addition of \ud835\udf07sil slightly changes the isothermal sound speed \ud835\udc50s, which is relevant in determining the parameters of the gas disc and solid particles (see Sec. 2). Although the variation of \ud835\udf07 has little impact on our results, we include the \ud835\udf07-variation for the consistency of the calculations.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nAfter volatile vapor transports outward due to viscous diffusion and gas-solid friction, it would condense into icy particles beyond the snow line. In this study, we do not model the nucleation of ice solid particles but initially distribute a small enough ice solid particle surface density, \u03a3vold , as seeds of condensation for simplicity. Following the condensation calculation of silicate vapor in sec. 2.2, we determine the surface density change rate of solid icy particles with \ud835\udf0cvolint = 1 g cm \u22123 as\n\u00a4\u03a3vold = (\ud835\udc45 vol con\u03a3 vol g \u2212 \ud835\udc45voleva)\u03a3vold , (60)\nwhere \ud835\udc45volcon and \ud835\udc45voleva are\n\ud835\udc45volcon = 2\n\u221a\ufe04 \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udf07vol \ud835\udc5f2d \ud835\udc5ad\ud835\udc3bg , (61)\n\ud835\udc45voleva = 2 \u221a 2\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc5f2d \ud835\udc5ad \u221a\ufe02 \ud835\udf07vol \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc43voleq , (62)\nand \ud835\udc43voleq is the saturation pressure for the volatile vapor. Assuming water vapor, we take values of A = 6062 [\ud835\udc3e] and B = 30.1 (Lichtenegger & Komle 1991) for \ud835\udc43voleq (Eq. 7). In this study, to highlight the condensation effect of volatile vapor outside the snow line, we neglect the advection/diffusion and sublimation of icy particles. In other words, we fix the icy particles produced by the condensation at the location where the condensation occurs. This might be the case due to the ineffective gas-drag drift of icy particles under the significantly small gas density outside the snow line (e.g., Fig. 8a) and due to the slow PR-drag in proportion to the distance from the central star (Eq. 47 or Eq. 49). Modeling of nucleation and the evolution of icy solid particles is left for future work."

            "text": "For the simulation in Sec. 4, we adopt the same numerical methods described in Sec. 2.7 except for the calculated region. To include the snow line which could be located at \u223c 30\ud835\udc45 (see below) in the calculated region, we take the region from the WD surface (\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc45WD \u223c 0.01 \ud835\udc45 ) out to a radius safely beyond the snow line (\ud835\udc5f \u223c 100 \ud835\udc45 ). The number of radial grids is 700\u20131000, depending on calculation settings. Same as in Sec. 2.7, we adopt the ring-like distribution of the silicate solid disc surface density, \u03a3sild , given by Eq. (54) as an initial condition. In this section, we fix \ud835\udc5f0 ' 0.5\ud835\udc45 and \u0394\ud835\udc5f ' 0.2\ud835\udc45 in Eq. (54) for all simulations, so that the most of the initial ring mass is located between the silicate sublimation line (\ud835\udc5f ' 0.1\ud835\udc45 ) and the Roche limit radius of rocky materials (\ud835\udc5f = 1.0\ud835\udc5fR \u223c 1.3 \ud835\udc45 ). We vary \u03a3d0 to change the initial silicate disc mass, \ud835\udc40sildisc; for example, \u03a3d0 \u223c 2 g/cm2 provides \ud835\udc40sildisc \u223c 10\n22 g, which is the same mass as in Sec. 3. The icy materials may undergo tidal disruption earlier than the rocky materials because the Roche limit radius of icy materials is located slightly farther than that of rocky materials due to the lower density of ice, \ud835\udf0cint = 1 g cm\u22123 (see Eq. 2). After the icy debris is produced, they sublimate to viscously spread to inward and outward. As an initial condition, we thus assume the volatile vapor is distributed from inside the Roche limit of rocky materials to outside the Roche limit of icy materials (0.5\ud835\udc45 < \ud835\udc5fvol < 2.5\ud835\udc45 ) with a surface density profile as\n\u03a3volg = \u03a3 vol g0\n( \ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc5f0\n)\u22121 . (63)\nWe change the initial disc mass of volatile vapor, \ud835\udc40voldisc, by changing \u03a3volg . The surface density with \u03a3g0 \u223c 0.3 g/cm2 produces \ud835\udc40voldisc \u223c 1022 g. In this section, we assume that all particles initially have \ud835\udc5fd = 1cm, as the observations of dust thermal emission suggested (Graham et al. 1990). We take \ud835\udefc = 10\u22123 as in Sec. 2.7 and fix the vertical thickness ratio of \ud835\udc3bE/\ud835\udc3bg at \ud835\udc53 = 0.1 (see sec. 2.5).\n4.2 Volatile-rich Discs: \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 1\nIn this section, we present the evolution of silicate discs with coevolving volatile vapor in the case of\ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 1. We then show the resulting accretion rate and time-integrated accretion mass of silicate/volatile components on theWD stellar surface. Such volatilerich discs might originate from the disruption of icy bodies which resided in cold outer regions such as Kuiper-Belt analogs. Taking the case of \ud835\udc40voldisc = 10\n22 g as an example, the physical quantities that characterize the two-component disc structure are shown in Figure 8. Outside the silicate line, the volatile vapor discs viscously spread to the snow line \ud835\udc5fsnow \u223c 26\ud835\udc45 without undergoing condensation. It drastically enhances the total gaseous surface density in a region overlapping with silicate dust particles compared to that of the one-component silicate discs (Fig. 5a). This provides several orders of magnitude smaller \ud835\udc4d (Fig. 8b) than one-component silicate discs, allowing for \ud835\udf10GD > \ud835\udf10PR. In consequence, the mass flux of silicate particles significantly exceeds the limit of PR-drag accretion flux, \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick, everywhere (Fig. 8c). The accretion flux of silicate vapor is lower than that of silicate particles, but it is still larger than \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick. This decrease is due to the fact that a limited fraction of the particles produced by the re-condensation of diffused-out silicate vapor can drift back to the silicate line (see Sec. 3.2 for the description of outward flow structure). On the other hand, the solid silicate disc affects the evolution of the volatile vapor disc. Due to the back-reaction of silicate dust particles, the surface density distribution of volatile vapor is much lower than that determined by the viscous evolution alone, \u03a3g \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22121, in a region overlapping with silicate dust particles (the middle panel of Fig. 8a). Compared to the results of Metzger et al. (2012), that region exhibits much more significant change in the radial profile of vapor disc, and this may come from our assumption on efficiency of the back-reaction, that is, \ud835\udc3bE. In that region, the surface density ratio of dust-to-gas within \ud835\udc3bE, \ud835\udc4d , is larger than St, and the value of \ud835\udc4d \u223c 100 tends to be maintained throughout evolution (Fig. 8b). This is one of the common features when the back-reaction of particles governs two-component disc evolution. Furthermore, the reduction of the volatile vapor accretion rate occurs when \ud835\udc4d > St (see below). The upper left panel of Figure 9 shows the resulting instantaneous accretion rate onto the stellar surface in the case of \ud835\udc40voldisc = 10 22 g. In contrast to the mono-compositional silicate disc evolution, high silicate accretion rate of \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick is produced due to gas drag from volatile vapor. As \ud835\udc4d > St, the accretion rate of silicate particles can be estimated by the gas-drag driven flux of silicate particles (Eq. (33) with \ud835\udc5e = 1),\n\u00a4\ud835\udc40GD ' 11 4 ( 1 \ud835\udc4d ) \ud835\udc53 St \ud835\udf10K ( \ud835\udc3bg \ud835\udc5f )2 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\u03a3g\n\u223c 6 \u00d7 1011 St \ud835\udc4d\n( \u03a3allg\n1 g cm\u22122 ) ( \ud835\udc5fsil \ud835\udc45 ) g/s, (64)\nwhere we use \ud835\udc4d = \u03a3d/ \ud835\udc53\u03a3g, \ud835\udc53 = 0.1, and \ud835\udc5fsil/\ud835\udc45 \u223c 0.1.

(64), \u00a4\ud835\udc40GD \u223c 6 \u00d7 109 g/s. Taking into account an order of magnitude decrease in the vapor flux due to the recycling flow structure at the silicate line, the above estimation well explains the value of \u00a4\ud835\udc40acc,sil in the simulation (Fig. 9). After 104 year, \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc increases with time to reach a peak value. Because the back-reaction becomes weak as the region where solid disc exists become narrow, \u03a3volg increases up to the value determined by viscous diffusion. Based on Eq. (64), larger \u03a3volg results in larger \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc.\nAs the initial disc mass increases, the accretion rate of silicate particles increases (the upper panels of Figure 9). This dependence is never seen in one-component silicate discs, where the accretion rate is always limited to \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR in the equilibrium state, even if we increase the disc mass. The dependence of \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc \u221d \ud835\udc40voldisc can be explained as follows: The larger initial volatile mass provides larger \u03a3g. On the other hand, for St in the Stokes regime, St does not depend on \u03a3g (Eq. 29). In addition, we find that the value of \ud835\udc4d is usually converged to \u223c 500 near the silicate line, even if we vary the disc mass but fix \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc. Thus, \u00a4\ud835\udc40 sil acc ' \u00a4\ud835\udc40GD monotonically increases with the increase of \u03a3g (Eq. 64). Based on this dependence, the wide range\nof observationally inferred high accretion rates can be covered by changing the initial mass of the volatile vapor disc. When the higher silicate accretion rate is produced at \ud835\udc61 < 5 \u00d7 104 years, the accretion rate of volatile, \u00a4\ud835\udc40volacc, is always suppressed at one order of magnitude lower value than \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc. This is because the back-reaction forces from dust particles decrease the surface density of volatile vapor in the region overlapping the silicate particles and reduces the volatile accretion rate. This suppression occurs when \ud835\udc4d > St is fulfilled everywhere in the silicate particle disc, and the degree of suppression would potentially depend on the efficiency of angular momentum exchange, i.e., \ud835\udc3bE in our model. However, after almost all silicate particles accrete onto the star, the back-reaction forces no longer work, resulting in the volatile-rich accretion. This latter accretion phasewould be inconsistentwith the observed photospheric compositional trend that the volatile is depleted. If the snow line location is sufficiently close (e.g., \u223c 3\ud835\udc45 ), the depletion timing of volatile vapor is faster, and the volatile-rich accretion phase would be possibly shorter (see Appendix C). As a result of the volatile-rich accretion, the silicate-to-volatile ratio in the total accretion mass approaches to \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc, that\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nis, one. The combining effects of condensation of volatile vapor diffused beyond the snow line and the back-reaction of dust to gas reduce the accretion mass of volatile components, but the reduction is only 30 % of the initial mass. The reduction mass fraction due to each effect is semi-analytically derived in Appendix B. The above evolution trend and \ud835\udc40silacc/\ud835\udc40volacc is independent of the disc mass as long as \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc is fixed. Therefore, we could conclude that the discs with \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 1 could not reproduce the silicate-rich composition in the almost all accretion phase (> 5 \u00d7 104 year) for short \ud835\udc61sink nor long \ud835\udc61sink.\n4.3 Discs with Less Volatile Vapor: \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 10\nIn section 4.2, for a fixed volatile and silicate ratio at unity, we have found that the silicate particles predominantly fall with a high accretion rate initially, but it is followed by an icy-rich accretion phase. In this section, we start with the disc with larger silicate-tovolatile mass ratio, \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 10, to investigate the possibility of avoiding an icy-rich accretion phase. The origin of such discs might correspond to the C-type asteroid analogs, which are mainly composed of rocky materials but include a small fraction of water ice. Figure 10 shows the instantaneous accretion rate (upper panels) and the accretion mass (lower panels). Even for the silicate disc mass significantly larger than the volatile disc mass, the gas drag drift from volatile vapor is effective, and \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc is able to exceed \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick. Furthermore, \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc increase with the increase of the disc mass, as in the case of\ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 1. Comparing the results for the same initial mass of volatile vapor discs between \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 1 and 10, \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc is somewhat smaller for larger \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc. Because larger \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc provides larger \ud835\udc4d , the back-reaction slows down the silicate accretion Eq. (64). As \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc increases further, \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc would asymptote that of one-component silicate discs, and the dependence on the disc mass would vanish. On the other hand, the evolution track is distinct from the case of \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 1. For the larger \ud835\udc40 sil disc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc case, as the volatile vapor disc is completely exhausted before the silicate solid disc accretes, silicate-rich composition of the accretion flux, \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc/ \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc \u223c 10 is retained over all phases of the accretion. This allows for a high silicate-to-volatile ratio of \u223c 10 even in the total accretion mass (the bottom panels of 10). Note that the ratio of 10 does not result from the silicate-to-volatile ratio in the initial disc mass but the backreaction effects of silicate particles to volatile vapor. In addition, the minor difference between the cases of \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 1 and 10 is the presence/absence of the increase in \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc with time. Because the back-reaction force exert on the volatile vapor until the end of the volatile vapor disc accretion for \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 10, \u03a3 vol g keeps a low constant value. Without the elevation of \u03a3volg , \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc is almost unchanged (Eq. 64). In addition, the back-reaction of silicate particles prolongs the lifetime of volatile vapor comparing to the disc evolve under the viscous accretion alone. This behavior cannot seen in Metzger et al. (2012), possibly resulting from the much stronger effects of backreaction of dust to gas than in Metzger et al. (2012) (see Sec. 4.1). With our settings of \ud835\udefc = 10\u22123 and \ud835\udc5fdisc \u223c 1.5\ud835\udc45 (the initial location of the volatile disc), the viscous time-scale of gas disc of volatile would be \ud835\udc5f2disc/3\ud835\udf08 \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\n4 year. On the other hand, the lifetime of volatile vapor reaches \u223c 106 years because of the slow down of viscous accretion due to the back-reaction (Fig. 10). As the back-\nreaction is likely to be stronger for larger \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc, lifetimes of volatile vapor are longer in the case of \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc=10. This allows the presence of volatile vapors to continue to affect the accretion rate of refractory solids for an extended period of time. In conclusion, the coupling to volatile vapor could simultaneously provide high- \u00a4\ud835\udc40 and refractory-rich photospheric composition when \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 10. The refractory-rich composition would be attained for any metal-sinking timescale \ud835\udc61sink, and hence both DA-type and DB-type WDs. However, the volatiles is mixed to the accretion onto the stellar photosphere in 10% by mass. If observational constraints allow the 10% inclusion, our results may possibly lead to a solution to the high- \u00a4\ud835\udc40 puzzle. We compare this fraction in more detail to the observationally inferred fraction of volatiles in Sec. 5.2."

            "heading": "5.1 Co-existence of Solid and Vapor Discs",
            "text": "For one-component silicate discs, the effect of re-condensation in our model is to drastically reduce the vapor density outside the silicate sublimation radius, \ud835\udc5fsil. This is because the timescale of re-condensation is several orders of magnitude shorter than that of outward advection/diffusion of silicate vapor. Even if we decrease the effectiveness of re-condensation by reducing the solid surface area, which the vapor can interact with, to the plate surface area (Eq. 12), these results hardly change. This immediate removal of silicate vapor could reconcile with observations that the gaseous emission lines have been detected in only a small number of systems (Manser et al. 2020). However, turning to such gaseous systems, there is a potential problemwith our proposed model: Most of the gaseous systems exhibit the refractory solid and refractory vapor discs spatially co-exist over a large range of radii, which seems to contradict our model suggesting effective removal of vapor. Based on the doppler-shift of gaseous emission lines due to the Keplerian motion, gas discs are inferred to extend to \u223c 1\ud835\udc45 , and this approximately coincides with the outer edge of solid discs (Melis et al. 2010). Moreover, the emission pattern in the gas disc of SDSS J1228 mainly comes from the outside of 0.6 \ud835\udc45 (Manser et al. 2016),whereas the disc of solids extendsmuch closer in (Brinkworth et al. 2009). Motivated by these observations, previous disc studies (Rafikov 2011a; Metzger et al. 2012) have theoretically modeled overlapping silicate solid and vapor without the effects of condensation. One possibility to solve this issuemight be the the photo-ionization heating by ultraviolet radiation. Due to this heating mechanism, the temperature of the gas in the disc upper layer, which is optically thin for host star\u2019s direct UV irradiaon, could be much higher than the blackbody equilibrium temperature predicted in Eq. (3) (Melis et al. 2010). The observed gas is actually as hot as \u223c 5000 K (e.g., Melis et al. 2010; Hartmann et al. 2016). Therefore, the condensation of silicate vapor would not occur in the disc upper layer, and therefore the gas may exist even if beyond the mid-plane silicate line. As the scale height of gas with \u223c 5000 K is several orders of magnitude larger than the vertical thickness of dust particle discs, they would be vertically decoupled (Melis et al. 2010). To verify\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nsuch decoupling, it would be needed to assess whether it takes a longer time for the upper gas to be mixed down toward the mid-plane or not. We will leave it for future work. In addition, if the upper hot gas layer and dust particles are decoupled, the runaway accretion driven by gas-drag drift acceleration is unlikely to occur."

            "text": "For the silicate discs including volatile vapor, the effects of the backreaction of dust particles to volatile vapor in our model provide a silicate-rich composition to both accretion flux and accumulated accretion mass, but they contain at least \u223c 10% of volatiles by mass (Sec. 4.3). On the observation side, we have not yet reached a high enough accuracy tomeasure volatile content of 10% even if present in the WD atmospheres, and therefore it may be premature to conclude whether our results are consistent or not. Although the discussion would be tentative, in this section, we compare the volatile mass fractions obtained in our simulations with those constrained from the photospheric observations so far. In addition, we address the issue that volatiles are rarely detected in the emission lines from the discs. As hydrogen never gravitationally sinks in WDs with heliumdominated atmospheres (DB-type), trace hydrogen in DB-type WDs is thought to potentially reflect the water accretion history (Jura et al.\n2009; Gentile Fusillo et al. 2017). Jura & Xu (2012) assembled 57 DB-type WDs within 80 pc of the Sun and estimated that their summed H accretion rate is < 1.4 \u00d7 107 g/s while the summed heavier atoms accretion rate is 1.6\u00d7 1010 g/s. This indicates that the hydrogen would account for < 0.1 wt% of the total mass accretion rate. On the other hand, assuming \u223c 10 wt% of volatile vapor as H2O vapor, our simulation results predict that hydrogen comprise 10 wt% \u00d7 2/18 \u223c 1 wt% of accreting mass. This is at least one order of magnitude larger than the observationally constrained H fraction, 0.1 wt%, although the Jura & Xu (2012)\u2019s sample included the low accretion rate systems, which might be mono-compositional silicate discs.\nTo explain the observational value, the silicate-to-volatile mass ratio in the accretion mass would have to be larger than 10. This may be possible if the angular momentum exchange between dust and gas is more efficient. It accelerates the gas-drag drift of silicate particles whilemovingmore volatile-vapormass outward. As a result, silicateto-volatile mass ratio in the accretion mass could be larger than 10 even if we start with \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 10. As the vertical turbulence of gas would determine the efficiency of angular momentum exchange through \ud835\udc3bE, larger \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc67 > 10\u22123 might make such a situation possible (Eq. 26). As another possibility, for the WDs with high temperature, the radiation pressure driven by large EUV luminosity, in particular, Lyman-\ud835\udefc line may inhibit the accretion of H atoms (G\u00e4nsicke et al.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\n2019), which would be produced by the dissociation of water vapor. The strong depletion of H compared to other atoms has been reported in the gas disc only composed of volatile elements (G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2019). Oxygen in excess of expected for oxide metals would be another evidence of water accretion (Farihi et al. 2013; Raddi et al. 2015; Farihi et al. 2016; Hoskin et al. 2020). Although there is a handful of systems indicating oxygen excess, we summarize the inferred water mass fraction of all the systems in Table 1. The water fraction is close to 10 wt% for two systems, while the other systems show a much larger water mass fraction than 10 wt%. The former may correspond to the accretion with \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 10 (Sec. 4.3), and the latter might correspond to the volatile-rich accretion periods which takes place in the accretion with \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc=1 (Sec. 4.2).\nFurthermore, all of the water accreting systems tend to show a metal accretion rate higher than that produced by PR drag, \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR \u223c 108 g/s, and some of their values are higher than \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR by orders of magnitude. Table 1 collects the total accretion rate of each system, which is observationally inferred. This might imply the potential association of water accretion with the high metal accretion rate, as our simulation results expect. Other than water ice, volatile elements such as N, C, and S could form solid ice in planetary bodies. However, these elements are unlikely to be responsible for the volatile vapor that promotes gas-drag drift of silicate particles: The detection of these elements is not so common, and the measured mass ratio or upper limit of C/Si is an\norder of 10\u22122\u221210\u22123 (G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2012). If we assume volatile vapor as carbon-monoxide and silicate as forsterite for example, C/Si in our simulation would be \u223c 0.2, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the observational ratio. For the disc of volatile vapor, there is a gap between our proposed calculations and the observations on disc emission lines: Our disc simulations predict that the surface density of volatile vapor is substantially larger than that of silicate gas in the region overlapping with the silicate particle discs (Fig. 8a). In contrast, whereas the emission lines of metallic vapor have been detected in that region in several\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nsystems (see section 5.1), those of volatile gas such as H and O are observed in only one system (Gentile Fusillo et al. 2021). This contradiction cannot be solved in the current framework of the proposed calculations, but it would be important to reveal whether the lack of the volatile emission line comes from the absence of volatile vapor itself or the disc properties such as temperatures and geometries and/or observational wavelength ranges (e.g., Hartmann et al. 2016; Steele et al. 2021). The assessment by combining our disc evolution simulation with photo-chemical and radiative-transfer calculations is left for future work."

            "text": "We have revisited the observed high accretion rate of compact planetary debris discs onto white dwarf (WD) stars that cannot be attained by the mass flux, \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick, by the Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag alone (Rafikov 2011b). We have also investigated the possibility that such high- \u00a4\ud835\udc40 is produced by the accretion with refractory-rich composition, suggested by observations on polluted atmospheres (e.g., Jura & Young 2014). Metzger et al. (2012) developed the first accretion disc model that formulates interaction between silicate particles and silicate vapor to propose that the mono-compositional refractory disc could reproduce the high accretion rate by runaway silicate solid accretion caused by increasing silicate vapor. Although Rafikov (2011a); Metzger et al. (2012) pointed out the potential importance of re-condensation of the silicate vapor, their model did not incorporate the condensation effect, considering the observations suggesting co-existence of silicate solids and vapors. In order to address this problem, we have performed onedimensional advection/diffusion simulations of silicate dust particles and vapor with their sublimation/re-condensation in a self-consistent manner. For this, we have applied the method developed by Hyodo et al. (2019, 2021), which formulates the gas drag as a force exerting on individual particles but takes into account the particle collective effects by including the back-reaction of solid to gas. This assumption would be different fromMetzger et al. (2012) that treated the gas drag as a plate drag. However, when the back-reaction is significantly strong (i.e., \ud835\udc4d > 1 and \ud835\udc4d > St), the drag-driven mass accretion rate derived in this work and in Metzger et al. (2012) shares the same dependence on the gas surface density, which is essential for the runaway accretion. We have found that in the one-component silicate disc, condensation entirely inhibits the runaway accretion proposed by previous works (Rafikov 2011a; Metzger et al. 2012). In both cases where we adopt our gas-drag drift formula derived from the particle-based approach and the plate-based approach of Metzger et al. (2012), the runaway accretion is completely halted by condensation (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). The silicate vapor density outside its sublimation line is solely determined by the saturating vapor pressure because the condensation timescale is short enough compared with the advection and diffusion. The radial dependence of the saturation pressure is so strong that co-existence of solid particles and vapor is limited. The environment of solid-dominated (\ud835\udc4d 1) and weak coupling between dust and vapor (St 1), both of which diminish the runaway accretion, is established (Fig. 5), resulting in a steady accretion state supplied by themass flux due to the PR-drag. Therefore, the accretion rate produced from the one-component silicate disc is exactly equal to \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick. The rate is independent of the disc parameters such as particle size and solid disc mass. For the observationally suggested co-existence of silicate solids and vapor, we have raised the possibility that photo-ionized hot gas layer exists in the optically thin upper\nregion, pointing out that such a possible gas layer does not revive the runaway accretion caused near the disc midplane (Sec. 5.1). We have additionally performed simulations coupling vapor of volatile elements (e.g., water vapor) that is produced by the sublimation of icy materials included in the infalling planetary bodies. As the dynamical arguments imply the supply of planetary bodies from the wide orbital regions (Mustill et al. 2018; Li et al. 2022), their volatile content may be diverse. In the case that the silicate-to-volatile mass ratio in the initial disc, \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc is 1, the silicate accretion rate can be higher than \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick for higher disc mass of volatile vapor (Fig. 9). However, the silicate-rich accretion period is always followed by the volatile-rich accretion period, and the volatile fraction in the total accretion mass reaches up to \u223c 50%. This conflicts with the observations on photospheric composition. In contrast, for \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 10, the suppression of volatile vapor accretion due to the back-reaction continues until the end of the volatile disc lifetime (Fig. 10). This maintains a silicate-rich composition throughout the whole accretion phase. Although the larger dust-to-gas density decreases the efficiency of accretion of solids, the silicate accretion rate is still higher than \u00a4\ud835\udc40PR,thick due to gas drag and increases with the increase of the disc mass of volatile vapor. The C-type asteroid analogs like Vesta are a plausible origin of the discs with small but non-negligible fraction of volatiles. Coupling to volatile might be a possible clue to the high- \u00a4\ud835\udc40 puzzle although the compositional issue is not completely solved. With the assumed efficiency of angular momentum exchange between dust and gas, our simulation results predict that the fraction of volatile in total accretion mass is 10 wt%. Such inclusion could not be dismissed with the current precision of the photospheric observation while the observations so far might suggest the much lower contents in accretion flux. As WD ultraviolet luminosity may possibly prevent the accretion of H atoms around the WDs of high temperatures (G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2019), it might be an important next step to incorporate the effects of WD radiation into our accretion disc evolution model. Furthermore, it will enable us to predict the emission lines from the gas discs and therefore to approach the remained issue that our currently proposed calculation could not consistently explain the lack of volatile emission lines from most of the discs."

This is the reproduction calculation of runaway accretion presented inMetzger et al. (2012), and obtained results are directly compared to those calculated from our model that assumes gas drag on individual particles but takes into account the dust back-reaction in Sec. 3.1. For this, we set our model in Sec. 2 with the tuning by i) turning off the condensation, and ii) using \ud835\udf10GD,M12 (Eq. 40) that is obtained from Metzger et al. (2012)\u2019s drag force per unit surface area, but iii) maintaining a weak enough particle diffusion (our code does not allow zero diffusion). For a fiducial value of \ud835\udefc = 10\u22123, we choose \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\u2217 = 0.3 so that the combination of \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\u2217 satisfies a condition for the runaway accretion that the feedback parameter safely exceeds 1 (see Metzger et al. 2012, for more details). The initial particle radius is 0.1 cm. The obtained surface density evolution and the accretion rate evolution onto WDs are shown in Figures A1 and A2, respectively. Compared to the results calculated from our particle-based model in Sec. 3.1, the difference of gas-drag drift velocity of dust particles only quantitatively changes the dust surface density distribution in the last phase of runaway accretion (see Figs. A1 and 3). Although the disc parameter choice affects the accretion rate evolution track, we can conclude that the runaway accretion phenomenon occurs commonly in two models (see Sec. 3.1 for more details)."

Accordingly, we vary \ud835\udc5fsnow to repeat the fiducial run with \ud835\udc40voldisc = \ud835\udc40 sil disc = 10\n22 g. In the simulation, \ud835\udc5fsnow is changed by changing the coefficient in the saturation pressure, B in Eq. (7) for simplicity, instead of changing disc temperature structure in Eq. (3). Figure C1 presents the accretion rate evolution of silicate and volatilewith various assumed \ud835\udc5fsnow. For smaller \ud835\udc5fsnow, \u00a4\ud835\udc40accvol drops earlier because volatile vapor reaches \ud835\udc5fsnow to start condensation earlier. In particular, for \ud835\udc5fsnow \u223c 3\ud835\udc45 , the volatile vapor is completely consumed before all of the silicate solid materials accrete. This resembles the evolution path of \ud835\udc40sildisc/\ud835\udc40 vol disc = 10 (Fig. 10), which maintain a constant high \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc and provide \u00a4\ud835\udc40silacc/ \u00a4\ud835\udc40volacc \u223c 10 at all times. As a result, the silicate-to-volatile ratio is 10 also in the total accretion mass. This suggests that if \ud835\udc5fsnow is sufficiently small, even the volatile-rich disc can reproduce the high accretion flux and silicate-rich composition for WDs with any metal-sinking time.
