    "abstractText": "We consider a prospective island distribution of bit-patterned media recording (BPMR) that consists of a hexagonal array called a staggered BPMR. Although the staggered BPMR can reduce twodimensional interference, including intersymbol interference from the downtrack direction and intertrack interference from the cross-track direction, the structure of the staggered BPMR is unsuitable for the detection schemes of regular BPMR. In the staggered BPMR, the islands along the neighboring tracks are skewed by a half period from the islands on the main track. Consequently, an island on the main track is distorted by the four closest islands on the neighboring tracks and the two closest islands on the main track. To detect the main data, based on the generalized partial response target, we divided the interference into three parts and applied three one-dimensional detectors. Then, to estimate the original signal, we averaged the three outputs of the three detectors. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model improves performance compared with those described in previous studies.

INTRODUCTION With perpendicular magnetic recording, hard disk drives confront the limitation of area density (AD) as a result of superparamagnetism [1]. Bit-patterned media recording (BPMR) is a promising technology for overcoming superparamagnetic limitations [2]. In BPMR, data are stored on magnetic islands. Therefore, to increase AD, the distance between the islands must be decreased [3]. This leads to intense two-dimensional (2D) interference, which includes intersymbol interference (ISI) from the downtrack direction and intertrack interference (ITI) from the cross-track direction. Therefore, the main factors that affect readback data are 2D interference, track misregistration (TMR), and media noise [4], [5].\nTo reduce 2D interference in signal processing, many researchers have primarily considered detection algorithms, error-correction coding, and modulation codes. Kovintavewat, Arrayangkool, and Warisarn proposed a modulation code with rates of 5/6 and 8/9 in [6] and [7], respectively, to avoid patterns that cause severe 2D interference. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain, Yang et al. [8] introduced a\nconcatenated low-density parity (LDPC) code. To estimate and balance the interference, Nabavi and Kumar [9] designed a 2D generalized partial response (GPR) target and equalizer. This helps to better combat interference because of the interference information. Next, to combat ITI, a modified Viterbi algorithm (MVA), which uses three parallel branches between any two states, was proposed by Nabavi, Kumar, and Zhu [10]. Inspired by the use of GPR and the MVA, Wang and Kurmar [11] developed a hybrid 2D equalizer and modified Viterbi detector (MVD). To combat 2D interference in BPMR, Kim and Lee [12] proposed a 2D detection method that includes two one-dimensional (1D) detections that remove interference from downtrack and cross-track directions, respectively. In their proposed model, the soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) [13] was used to create an iterative scheme and combine the information from two parallel detections. In addition, the SOVA was replaced by the maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm in a parallel scheme [14\u201316]. With the MAP algorithm, better detection performance is achieved, but the complexity is increased.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n6 VOLUME XX, 2017\nTo handle interference in a multitrack multihead model, Koonkarnkhai and Kovintavewat [17] proposed a simple ITI mitigation for a two-head two-track BPMR channel, in which two read heads were used to read two data tracks and decode them simultaneously. To boost system performance with the turbo decoding process [18], Koonkarnkhai and Kovintavewat introduced the model in [19], [20].\nIn a BPMR, the magnetic islands can be arranged on a regular square grid or a staggered array, as shown in Fig. 1 [21]. In [21], the authors showed that the BPMR with staggered array islands exhibited better bit error ratio (BER) performance than regular array islands for the same AD.\nHowever, because of the half-bit skewed structure between tracks, staggered BPMR cannot handle 2D interference with the above algorithms. Some authors have proposed a 2D equalizer to convert the received signal into 1D interference and used conventional 1D detection [22], [23]. In [22], the authors focused on a GPR target and equalizer for a staggered BPMR. In addition, in [23], the authors used a partial response (PR) target and focused on three parallel detections for staggered BPMR. Therefore, we implemented a system that combines the advantages of the above studies.\nIn this study, we propose parallel detection based on a GPR target. First, we analyze and introduce constraints for the GPR target to achieve the desired interference forms. Then, the interference in the received signal is converted into the desired interference form and input into three parallel directions. One is the interference from two neighboring islands on the main track, which is called horizontal interference (HI). The second is the interference from the left-skewed island on the upper track and the right-skewed island on the lower track, which is called negative diagonal interference (NDI). The third is interference from the left-skewed island on the lower track and the right-skewed island on the upper track, which is called positive diagonal interference (PDI). The definitions of these interference forms are presented in Fig. 2.\nFIGURE 2. Three kinds of interference: (a) horizontal interference (HI), (b) negative diagonal interference (NDI), and (c) positive diagonal interference (PDI).\nHI, NDI, and PDI were removed by three 1D detections to detect the signals. We also proposed an average function to combine the estimated information from the outputs of three 1D detections. To increase the efficiency of the average function, we used the SOVA and the MAP algorithm to create a soft output. In the simulation, the results show that the average function significantly improves BER performance compared with that with no averaging. Simultaneously, our proposed detection also achieves better performance than that from the previous study [22], [23].\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:  Based on the theory of the GPR target, we propose\nconstraints to create GPR target forms for staggered bitpatterned media, which include HI, NDI, and PDI forms.  From the HI, NDI, and PDI forms, we designed parallel detection to solve the 2D interference of staggered BPMR systems.  To improve the BER performance of parallel detection, we propose and investigate the parameters of the average function.  Finally, our proposed GPR target and detection are suitable for the skewed structure of the staggered BPMR medium, which is an efficient structure compared to the regular array and is gradually gaining attention.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the GPR target and describe the detection of staggered BPMR. Simultaneously, we propose constraints to achieve HI, NDI, and PDI. Based on the target forms, in Section III, we describe the design of a parallel detection method for staggered BPMR systems. In Section IV, the parameters of the average function are investigated. In this section, we present and discuss the simulation results. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section V."

In the first branch, y[j,k] passes through the equalizer and is converted into signal z[j,k], which is similar to the signal distorted by 1D horizontal interference. The signal z[j,k] is entered into the 1D horizontal detector. In the second branch, the equalizer reshapes signal y[j,k] into signal zn[j,k], which is similar to the signal distorted by 1D negative diagonal interference. It is detected by the 1D diagonal detector in the negative diagonal direction. Finally, signal y[j,k] is balanced into signal zh[j,k], which is similar to the signal distorted by 1D positive diagonal interference. Therefore, zh[j,k] is detected by the 1D diagonal detector in the positive diagonal direction. To combine the outputs of the three detections, the SOVA or MAP algorithm must be used to create a soft output signal. The horizontal detection creates the soft signal ah[j,k], the detections with the negative and positive diagonal direction create the soft signal an[j,k] and ap[j,k], respectively. Then, these soft signals are passed through the average function.\nThe output of the average function a[j,k] is as follows:\n              1, , , , 0, , 1, , , , 0, h n p\nh n p\na j k a j k a j k a j k\na j k a j k a j k              \n(38)\nwhere 0 \u2264 \ud835\udefc \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 \ud835\udefd \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 \ud835\udefe \u2264 1, and \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd + \ud835\udefe = 1. We investigate the parameters \ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd, and \ud835\udefe in the simulation section (Section IV).

            "text": "Based on [27], we set Tx = Tq = 14.5 nm to achieve an AD of 3 Tb/in2 for the staggered BPMR. First, we used three pages for training. On each page, we randomly created data u[k] with a size of 1,440,000 and the same probabilities for 0 and 1. Then, u[k] was modulated into a data page a[j,k] with a size of 1,200 \u00d7 1,200. In the training process, the model shown in Fig. 3 was used to collect the signals y[j,k] and d[j,k]. Then, in\nthe MMSE algorithm, constraints (14) and (15) were applied to estimate the parameters for the equalizer and horizontal detection in the first branch. Constraints (17) and (18) were used to supply the coefficients for the equalizer and diagonal detection in the second branch. Finally, using constraints (20) and (21), we obtained the parameters for the equalizer and diagonal detection in the third branch.\nIn the test processing, ten data pages were created, similar to those in the training processing. Each data page goes to the model, as shown in Fig. 4. Using the estimated original signal a[j,k] from ten data pages, we calculated the BER performance for our proposed model and the models in previous studies. In addition, in this study, we defined the SNR as 10log10(1/\u03c32).\nIn the first experiment, we investigated parameters \ud835\udefc , \ud835\udefd , and \ud835\udefe. We set up SNR = 14 dB and chose samples \ud835\udefc such as [0, 0.2, 1/3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1]. To satisfy the constraints of \ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd, and \ud835\udefe, parameter \ud835\udefd was varied from 0 to 1  \ud835\udefc (0 \u2264 \ud835\udefd \u2264 1  \ud835\udefc), and the values of \ud835\udefd were taken from the samples of \ud835\udefc. Values of \ud835\udefe were set as \ud835\udefe = 1  \ud835\udefc  \ud835\udefd. For a fast simulation, we used the SOVA for detection in this experiment. The results are presented in Table I. We can see that the model achieves the best performance when \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = \ud835\udefe = 1/3. The performance reduces when one among three variables \ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd, and \ud835\udefe has a larger value than the remaining two variables. Especially, when one among three variables \ud835\udefc , \ud835\udefd , and \ud835\udefe equals to 1, the performance is the worst. This shows that the information from three detections are equally important. Simultaneously, the model with three detections (\ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = \ud835\udefe) achieves the performance better than the model with one detection (\ud835\udefc = 1 or \ud835\udefd = 1 or \ud835\udefe = 1).\nBased on the first experiment, we set up \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = \ud835\udefe = 1/3. We estimated our proposed model using the SOVA and MAP algorithm. At the same time, we also compared our proposed model with that of the previous study. The results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 9\nIn [23], the authors used three detection branches for the three-path (3P) SOVA model to detect the received signal in staggered BPMR systems. Our proposed model can improve the BER performance compared to that of the model in [23]. We replaced the PR target with a GPR target. In the GPR target, the target coefficients are estimated allowing real values not only the discrete coefficient like the PR target. Therefore, the GPR target achieves better accuracy than the PR target. In addition, in [23], the authors just used two PR targets to estimate and supply the interference coefficients to three detections. The horizontal PR target is supplied to the horizontal detection and the vertical PR target is supplied to two vertical detections. This makes the vertical detection cannot exploit all the information from the vertical direction. In [22], we used only the GPR3 and GPR32 forms because the size of our GPR target was ring 1 [24]. The authors defined the GPR3 form as the GPR target with three interference coefficients from the main track (Fig. 7a). For the GPR32 form, the GPR target has interference coefficients from the main track and two interference coefficients from neighboring tracks (upper and lower tracks) (Fig. 7b). In [22], the authors\napplied the GPR32 form with perfectly known data on sidetracks. Therefore, the performance of GPR32 becomes ideal and is compared with that of our proposed model in the ideal case in Fig. 6. We also used the GPR32 form with perfectly known data in the horizontal, negative diagonal, and positive diagonal directions, as shown in Fig. 8. The model in [22] cannot achieve better performance because, with the form of GPR3, the model in [22] just can exploit the interference information from the horizontal direction and ignore the interference from other directions. Therefore, the model in [22] is similar to our proposed model with just one branch of horizontal detection and cannot perform better than our proposed model. In addition, the reason for these results is that the GPR target can estimate the change in the interference and provide the information for detection.\nFIGURE 7. Definitions of the (a) GPR3 form and (b) GPR32 form.\nFIGURE 8. Perfectly known data according to the (a) horizontal, (b) negative diagonal, and (c) positive diagonal directions.\nNext, we evaluate the system performance of the proposed model for other ADs. Based on [25], we can achieve ADs of 2 and 4 Tb/in2 corresponding to Tx = Tz = 18 nm and Tx = Tz = 12.5 nm, respectively.

First, we varied the level of the TMR effect from 0% to 20% at SNR = 14 dB. The results are shown in Fig. 10.\nBased on the investigation from Fig. 10, we can see that the proposed model can achieve the best performance up to 16% TMR. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed model resists the level of the TMR effect up to 16%.\nIn the media noise simulation, we used the position fluctuation model used in [26]. Parameters \u2206x and \u2206q were modeled as correlated Gaussian random processes. To generate correlated Gaussian noise, we used white Gaussian noise through a digital filter with the equation \u2206(k) = \ud835\udf00\u2206(k 1) + \ud835\udf09nw(k), where \ud835\udf00 = 0.9, \ud835\udf09 = \u221a1 \u2212 \ud835\udf002, nw is the input white noise, and \u2206 is the value of \u2206x or \u2206q. We varied the level of the media noise from 0% to 20% at SNR = 14 dB. The results of the media-noise simulations are shown in Fig. 11. Our proposed model can achieve the best performance up to 16% fluctuation position.\nFIGURE 11. BER performance depending on the fluctuation position.\nFinally, we simulate the BPMR channels with (4% TMR, 4% position fluctuation) and (8% TMR, 8% position fluctuation). The performance of the proposed model in the BPMR channel with both the TMR effect and media noise is illustrated in Fig. 12. The proposed model achieves the best performance when using the MAP algorithm for the detection. Therefore, in this experiment, we only show the performance with the MAP algorithm."
