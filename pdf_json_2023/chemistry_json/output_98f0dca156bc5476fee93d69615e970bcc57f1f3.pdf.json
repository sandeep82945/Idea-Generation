    "abstractText": "Oxidative stress surrounding cancer cells provides them with certain growth and survival advantages necessary for disease progression. In this context, Se-containing molecules have gained attention due to their anticancer and antioxidant activity. In our previous work, we synthesized a library of 39 selenoesters containing functional groups commonly present in natural products (NP), which showed potent anticancer activity, but did not demonstrate high radical scavenger activity. Thus, 20 novel Se derivatives resembling NP have been synthesized presenting acylselenourea functionality in their structures. Radical scavenger activity was tested using DPPH assay and in vitro protective effects against ROS-induced cell death caused by H2O2. Additionally, antiproliferative activity was evaluated in prostate, colon, lung, and breast cancer cell lines, along with their ability to induce apoptosis. Compounds 1.I and 5.I showed potent cytotoxicity against the tested cancer cell lines, along with high selectivity indexes and induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis. These compounds exhibited potent and concentration-dependent radical scavenging activity achieving DPPH inhibition similar to ascorbic acid and trolox. To conclude, we have demonstrated that the introduction of Se in the form of acylselenourea into small molecules provides strong radical scavengers in vitro and antiproliferative activity, which may lead to the development of promising dual compounds.",

            "text": "Cancer continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. According to the World Health Organization, the most common types of cancer are breast (2.26 million cases), lung (2.21 million cases), and colon and rectum (1.93 million) [1]. Cancer includes a group of complex and multifactorial diseases characterized by the uncontrolled division of body cells. Chemotherapy is one of the most common treatments, and it is used at different stages of the disease. However, cancer\u2019s heterogenicity and the increase in resistance have underlined the need for the development of new anticancer drugs. Selenium-containing molecules have emerged as a promising line of research due to the unique properties of this atom, such as its versatility and its high antioxidant capacity. Selenium (Se) is a trace mineral essential for the proper functioning of the organism and is required in small amounts (RDA 50 \u00b5g/day). It is a component of the selenoproteins\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1331. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12071331 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1331 2 of 23\ninvolved in processes related to reproduction, metabolism, DNA synthesis, and protection against oxidative damage. Its antioxidant function has been the starting point of numerous investigations to develop new active molecules containing Se for the treatment of different diseases including infectious diseases, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and cardiovascular diseases [2,3]. In cancer, there is an imbalance in the oxidation-reduction reactions, and thus, the environment surrounding the cancer cells is a pro-oxidant environment that provides them with certain growth and survival advantages necessary for disease progression [4,5]. Endogenous antioxidant enzymatic systems include glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and thioredoxin reductase, which are selenoproteins. Thus, Se exerts its antioxidant property primarily through its role in selenoproteins [6,7]. Se-containing compounds have exhibited different mechanisms of action depending on the type of tumor, including alterations in carcinogen metabolism, stimulation of DNA repair, modulation of the immune response, regulation of angiogenesis and cell migration, stimulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, entosis . . . ), and modulation of the activity of some kinases as the most representative ones [8,9]. Se can be introduced into the molecule in different chemical forms, such as selenoester, acylselenourea, or diselenides. Among all Se-containing molecules, acylselenoureas and selenoureas represent a group of simple but well-established molecules with anticancer and/or antioxidant properties [10\u201313]. Our research group previously developed aromatic acylselenoureas showing promising results. We demonstrated that acylselenourea derivatives are excellent radical scavenging agents, which present a fast kinetics behavior and antioxidant effects similar to ascorbic acid and trolox. Compound 1 (Figure 1) stood out as a dual agent showing both antioxidant and selective cytotoxic activity in breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). Additionally, compounds 2 and 3 (Figure 1), acylselenourea derivatives combined with diselenide motifs, also demonstrated high potency and selectivity against breast cancer MCF-7 cells [10,11].\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 24\nprotection against oxidative damage.

Silica gel 60 (0.040\u20130.063 mm) 1.09385.2500 (Merk, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for Column Chromatography with hexane/ethyl acetate as the elution solvent. Melting points were determined using a Mettler FP82 + FP80 apparatus (Greifense, Switzerland). 1H-, 13C-, 77Se, COSY, NOESY, HMBC, and HSQC-NMR spectrums were recorded on a Bruker Avance Neo 400 MHz in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 operating at 400, 100, and 76 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts were reported in \u03b4 values (ppm) and J values were reported in hertz (Hz). All the compounds are >95% pure by quantitative NMR (1H q-NMR) using dimethyl sulfone as a reference and elemental analysis. For the 1H q-NMR, the results are expressed as the percentage of purity and were calculated tracking the signal of the CH2 which appears between 5.90 and 6.05 ppm for series I, the first alkene hydrogen which appears around 5.9 ppm for series II, and the signal of CH2 which appears around 3.7 ppm for series III.\n2.1.2. General Procedure for the Preparation of Acylselenourea Derivatives\nSome acyl chlorides were formed by reacting the corresponding carboxylic acid with oxalyl chloride in methylene chloride using N,N-DMF as a catalyst. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for twelve hours and the reaction solvent was removed by rotatory evaporation in vacuo. The synthetic procedure was described in previous works of our group [10,11]. Briefly, the corresponding acyl chloride (1 eq.) was reacted with potassium selenocyanate (1 eq.) in anhydrous acetone (30 mL) as a solvent for one hour at room temperature. Then, the corresponding aliphatic amine (1 eq.) was added in situ and allowed to stir for a period of time ranging from 0.5 h to 24 h depending on the heterocycle. The reaction mixture was filtered under vacuum and acetone was removed by rotatory evaporation at reduced pressure. The purification of the compounds was carried out by column chromatography. The eluent used was a gradient of hexane/ethyl acetate, ranging between 15% and 70% of ethyl acetate. The TLCs were performed using a mobile phase of hexane/ethyl acetate with a ratio of 2:8.

In this work, the DPPH\u2022 colorimetric assay was carried out. Measurements were recorded on a BioTeck PowerWave XS spectrophotometer (BioTeck Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA) and data were collected using KCJunior v.1.41. software (BioTeck Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Compounds with potent activity were selected to further determine their protective effect against ROS-induced cell death caused by H2O2.\nDPPH Radical Scavenging Assay\nDPPH colorimetric assay was performed to determine the in vitro radical scavenging activity of the acylselenourea derivatives. DPPH assay was performed as described by Svinyarov [14]. For each acylselenourea, a stock solution of 1 mg/mL in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was made, and these solutions were used to prepare the different concentrations employed in the assay. The compounds were tested at two different concentrations (0.003 and 0.03 mg/mL). Intermediate solutions were prepared in methanol and a volume of 100 \u00b5L of each was added to each well of the plate. Then, 100 \u00b5L of DPPH\u2022 (previously prepared at a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL in methanol and preserved in the dark) was added to the previous methanolic acylselenourea solutions. The discoloration of the purple radical to the yellow reduced form was followed at 517 nm at different time points (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min). Ascorbic acid and trolox were used as positive controls. All measurements were carried out in triplicate.

Cell lines MDA-MB-231, HTB-54, DU-145, and BEAS-2B were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco). HT-29 cell line was grown in McCoy\u2019s 5A (Gibco), 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 \u25e6C and 5% CO2. The culture medium was changed every three days.\n2.3.2. Cell Viability Assay\nThe cell viability of each compound was measured by MTT colorimetric assay [15]. Each compound was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 0.01 M. Each compound was tested at two different concentrations (10 and 50 \u00b5M) in MDA-MB-231 (breast), HTB-54 (lung), DU-145 (prostate), and HT-29 (colon) human cancer cell lines. Serial dilutions were prepared with supplemented culture medium. Additionally, the most active compounds (those that showed less than 50% cell growth at 10 \u00b5M in two of the four lines evaluated) were further evaluated at seven different concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 \u00b5M) in HTB-54, DU-145, and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines and non-malignant BEAS-2B lung cell line. IC50 and selectivity indexes (SI) were determined. Briefly, 1 \u00d7 104 tumor cells per well were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h. Then, these cells were incubated for 48 h with either DMSO (control) or a different concentration of each of the tested compounds. The cell viability was determined by adding 20 \u00b5L of MTT two hours and a half before the termination point. After this time, the culture medium was removed. The resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in 50 \u00b5L of DMSO, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. Results are expressed as % cell growth. The data were obtained from at least three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate.\n2.3.3. Protective Effects against H2O2-Induced Oxidative Stress in DU-145 Cells\nCells were treated with the selected compounds and then oxidative damage to DU145 cells was induced using different concentrations of H2O2 (200, 250 and 300 \u00b5M), and cell viability was assessed by the MTT method. Briefly, 2.5 \u00d7 104 DU-145 cells per well were added in 96-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, DMSO, 1.I, 2.I, 5.I, 7.II, 10.II, and ascorbic acid were added to each well at two different concentrations (0.0015 mg/mL and 0.0003 mg/mL) and incubated for 1 h. After that, H2O2 was added at the concentrations of 200, 250, and 300 \u00b5M, and the cells were incubated for 12 h to induce cell damage. MTT assay was used to measure cell viability. For each treatment, the mean cell viability was calculated from three independent experiments. The DMSO-treated controls were assigned with a cell viability value of 100% (Vcontrol). The results are expressed as a cell growth inhibition % caused by H2O2 and the increased fold of cell survival, as follows: \u2022 Cells without compounds, only treated with H2O2:\n% Cell growth inhibition = Acontrol \u2212 Asample\nAcontrol \u00d7 100 (2)\n\u2022 Cells treated with compounds and H2O2:\n% Cell growth inhibition = Asample (compound) \u2212 Asample (compound+H2O2)\nAcontrol \u00d7 100 (3)\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1331 9 of 23\nIncrease \u2212 fold of cell survival = % cell growth inhibition (H2O2)\n% cell growth inhibition (compound+ H2O2) (4)\nThe standard error of the mean (SEM) was calculated in at least three independent experiments performed in quadruplicates.\n2.3.4. Apoptosis Assays\nInduction of apoptosis was assayed using Annexin V & Dead Cell assay kit and Caspase 3/7 assay kit (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). DU-145 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 6 \u00d7 105 cells/well and treated either with DMSO (control) or 10 \u00b5M of compounds 1.I and 5.I and incubated for 24 h. At the end of treatment, cells were harvested and processed with appropriate staining according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For the Caspase 3/7 assay, cells were stained with 5 \u00b5L of Muse\u2122 Caspase 3/7 working solution and incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 30 min. After incubation, 150 mL of Muse\u2122 Caspase 7-AAD working solution was added and the samples were incubated for another 5 min at room temperature in the dark. For Annexin V assay, cells were stained with 100 \u00b5L pf Muse\u2122 Annexin V & Dead Cell Reagent and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark prior to analysis. Samples were further analyzed on a Muse\u2122 Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) using Muse\u2122 1.4 software. Data were obtained from at least two independent experiments.\n2.3.5. ROS Measurement\nTotal ROS levels were measured in DU-145 cells treated with 1.I and 5.I using the Muse Oxidative Stress Kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. This kit uses Muse oxidative stress reagent to detect ROS inside cells. This kit identifies two different cell populations: ROS(\u2212) cells and ROS(+) cells. In the graph, the ROS(\u2212) population is represented by the M1 peak and the ROS(+) cells by the M2 peak. DU-145 cells treated with H2O2 (0.9 \u00b5M) were used as positive controls to identify M1 and M2 peaks. Percentages of ROS(\u2212) and ROS(+) cells were measured using the Muse Cell Analyzer.\n2.3.6. Statistical Analysis\nData were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) and experiments were performed three times in triplicates unless otherwise specified. IC50 values were determined using a non-linear curve regression analysis calculated by OriginPro 9.0.0 software (OriginLab Corporation; Northampton, MA, USA). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences when comparing control and compounds or treatments alone. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software; San Diego, CA, USA), and the statistically significant values (pvalue) for ANOVA analysis were taken as **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01 and * p < 0.05.\n2.4. X-ray Christallography of 1.II\nEvaporation of ethyl acetate from the test tube during the chromatography column gave a single crystal of 1.II. Appropriate crystals were selected for data collection on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD0 diffractometer and mounted on a nylon loop using paratone oil. The crystal was kept at room temperature (~25 \u25e6C) during data collection. Using Olex2 [16], the structure was solved with the XS [17] structure solution program using Direct Methods, and refined with the XL [17] refinement package using Least Squares minimization."

Thus, taking into account all these previous observations, we have synthesized 20 novel derivatives replacing the selenoester functional group by acylselenourea to obtain more potent radical scavengers (Figure 2). In the acyl moiety, we envisioned the introduction of different small aromatic cycles, including heterocycles such as thiophene, pyridine, furan, and benzodioxole. According to the FDA, many of chemotherapeutic agents contain heterocycles in their structure [19,20]. In the opposite location of the molecules, aliphatic amines derived from natural products (allyl and propargyl fragments) were included. The allylic motif is present in many bioactive molecules, such as allylic sulfides or allicin in garlic, or eugenol and myristicin in parsley and cloves. These natural allyl derivatives have demonstrated potent anticancer activity in a variety of cancers through different mechanisms of action [21]. On the other hand, the propargyl motif can be found in marine sources, including viridamide, a bioactive compound from marine cyanobacteria, and duryne, a sponge metabolite [22,23]. Strategies to change both sides of the molecule aim to find synergies between the fragment and the acylselenourea itself. In addition to the allylic and propargylic fragments (terminal double and triple bonds, respectively) the synthesized molecules will include the propyl motif (saturated chain).

Antioxidant Activity\nOxidative stress is associated with cancer progression by promoting tumor cell\ntransformation, proliferation, and survival [27]. For this reason, molecules capable of\nradical scavenging might be developed to treat cancer. Se compounds, such as ebselen,\nhave shown significant antioxidants activity [28,29,30], the latter possessing glutathione\nperoxidase-like activity. We therefore decided to evaluate the radical scavenging activity\nof the compounds using the DPPH assay. Compounds exhibiting interesting radical\nscavenging and anticancer activity were also tested in a prostate cancer cell line (DU-145)\nto confirm their ability to prevent ROS-induced cell death.\nDPPH Radical Scavenging Assay\nThe DPPH assay was used as a first experimental approach to determine the radical\nscavenging activity of the synthesized acylselenourea derivatives. Measurements were\nperformed at two different concentrations (0.003 and 0.03 mg/mL) and collected at\ndifferent time points (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min). The results obtained at 120 min for\nboth concentrations are depicted in Figure 3, and the results obtained at the highest\nconcentration at the different time points are presented in Figure 4. The results for the\nconcentration of 0.003 mg/mL are depicted in Table S3.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the radical scavenging activity of the compounds was dose-\ndependent. Moreover, at the highest concentration evaluated (0.03 mg/mL) most of them\nexhibited time-dependent and similar activity to the positive controls (Figure 4).\nComparing between the three series, I and II showed potent DPPH radical scavenging\nactivity, unlike series III. It seems that the propargyl chain (series III) caused a loss of\ninhibitory activity. As shown in Figure 3, all the molecules from series I and II that do not\nhave a double bond between the carbo- or hetero-cycle and the carbonyl group of the\nacylselenourea (6.I, 3.II, 4.II, 6.II, 9.II and 3.III) showed DPPH inhibitory activity similar\nto ascorbic acid at 120 min. These results seem to be contrary to the study published by\nEstarad et al. in 2016, where they developed hybrids of cinnamic-benzylpiperidine and\ncinnamic dibenzyl(N-methyl)amine with high antioxidant activity (similar to trolox),\ndespite possessing a cinnamoyl group. However, it appears that this antioxidant capacity\ndepended more on the hydroxyl groups of the benzene ring (phenol groups), since the\nantioxidant capacity was lost when they were replaced by methoxy groups [31]. These\nsame way, the propargyl group (series III) also possesses an acidic hydrogen (\u2261CH) that\ncould be released and scavenge the DPPH radical. However, the results we have obtained\ngo in the opposite direction, since the propargyl derivatives have shown a lower inhibitory\nactivity.

However, it appears that this antioxidant capacity depended more on the hydroxyl groups of the benzene ring (phenol groups), since the antioxidant capacity was lost when they were replaced by methoxy groups [31]. These results might be related to the weak acid character of the phenol group, which can yield the hydrogen from the \u2013OH under suitable conditions and scavenge free radicals.

The cell viability was determined after 48 h of treatment using MTT assay.

On the\nother hand, compound 11.II differ from compound 10.II in that instead of presenting two\nacylselenourea groups, it presents only one together with an amide group. This com-\npound, at 10 \u00b5M, showed cell growth higher than 77.0%, evidencing e crucial role\nplayed by the acylselenourea functional group in the ant ncer activity.\n(A) (B)\n(C) (D)\nFigure 5. Synthesized compounds reduced cell viability in several human cancer cell lines.

The potential selectivity\nof these compounds was further investigated in a cell line derived from normal lung tissue\n(BEAS-2B). Results are expressed as IC50 and the SI, calculated as the ratio of the IC50 values\ndetermined for the non-malignant and the tumor cells, respectively (IC50 (BEAS-2B)/IC50\n(HTB-54)). The results are shown in Table 1.\nCompounds 1.I and 5.I exhibited the most potent activity with IC50 values in lung\ncancer cells (HTB-54) < 10 \u00b5M, along with high SI towards malignant lung cancer cells (SI\nof >12.7 and >11.9, respectively). On the other hand, compound 2.I, which contains a thi-\nophene ring with propyl chain, showed high cytotoxicity against normal lung tissue. De-\nrivatives 2.III and 8.III from series III (propargyl) showed anticancer activity with IC50\nvalues of 11.6 and 21.7, respectively, against HTB-54 cells, with 8.III being more selective\ntowards malignant lung cancer cells (SI of 2.3 and >4.6, respectively). On the other hand,\nthe introduction of the allyl chain (compounds 7.II and 10.II) led to potent cytotoxicity\nagainst normal lung tissue cells (BEAS-2B) with IC50 values of 6.3 and 29.9 \u00b5M. Thus, the\nSI for these compounds was low (0.5 and 0.7, respectively). Additionally, compounds 1.I\nand 5.I, which exhibited the highest SI towards malignant lung cancer cells, were also\nevaluated against MDA-MB-231 (breast) and DU-145 (prostate) cancer cell lines (Figure\n6). Both compounds showed similar IC50 values of 8.8 \u00b5M and 9.5 \u00b5M for compound 1.I,\nand 15.5 \u00b5M and 11.5 \u00b5M for compound 5.I, against MDA-MB-231 and DU-145, respec-\ntively. As shown in Table 1, these two derivatives showed similar IC50 values to cisplatin,\neven better for HTB-54 cells, along with SI > 20 times higher than cisplatin towards normal\nFigure 5.

Cell growth % at 10 \u00b5 after 48 h of treat ent of synthesized compounds: (A) series I, (B) series III, and (C), and (D) series II.\nIn general, the synthesized compounds demonstrated a moderate anticancer activity against the panel of four cancer cell lines (Figure 5). Prostate cell line DU-145 was the most sensitive one, since 8 out of 20 compounds exhibited a cell growth < 60% at 10 \u00b5M, highlighting compounds 6.I, 10.II, and 2.III, which showed a cell growth < 20%. Overall, molecules from series I (propyl) exhibited the most potent anticancer activity against the panel of cancer cell lines.\nThe following preliminary structure activity relationship (SAR) could be determined:\n\u2022 Compounds 5.I and 6.I differ only in the presence of a double bond (6.I) between the benzene ring and the carbonyl group. This structural modification led to a loss of activity against MDA-MB-231, HT-29, and HTB-54 cell lines, whereas it improved the activity against the prostate DU-145 cell line (cell growth at 10 \u00b5M of 42.4% and 19.47% for 5.I and 6.I, respectively). For these same derivatives, but of the series II (allyl), the introduction of this double bond was also observed to slightl improve t activity in the MDA-MB-231 ce l ine (cell growth at 10 \u00b5M of 80.4% and 51.8% for 5.II and 6.II, re pective y). Compound 6.II showed better activity than 5.II against the DU-145 cell line (c ll growth at 10 \u00b5M of 57.30% and 97.5%, r spectively); \u2022 On the ot er and, comparing comp unds 5.I, 5.II, and 5.III, which only differ in the aliphatic chain, it was observed that 5.I (propyl) show d more potent anticancer activity agai st the panel of the four cell lines, 5.II and 5.III being hardly active; \u2022 Compounds 1.II and 3.II contain a furan ring in their structure and their only diff rence is the d uble bond (3.II) bet een the heterocycle and c rbonyl. However, on this occasion, both showed low activity with cell growth % between 54.8\u201395.0 at 10 \u00b5M. Their series III analogues (1.III and 3.III) also showed low-moderate activity for the\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1331 14 of 23\nMDA-MB-231, HT-29, and HTB-54 cell lines. However, the DU-145 cell line proved to be more sensitive to 1.III, showing a cell growth of 42.2 at 10 \u00b5M;\n\u2022 Compound 1.I (propyl) showed more potent anticancer activity than its analogues (1.II and 1.III) against the same four cancer cell lines panel. On the other hand, compounds 3.II and 3.III did not exhibit great anticancer activity; \u2022 For the thiophene derivatives (2.II and 4.II), the presence of this double bond led to a loss of activity in the lung HTB-54 cell line (cell growth at 10 \u00b5M of 35.8% and 79.2% for 2.II and 4.II, respectively). For the rest of the cell lines, 2.II and 4.II presented moderate-low activity. The presence of the allyl chain in the thiophene analogues (2.II) led to a loss of activity compared to propyl and propargyl derivatives (2.I and 2.III); \u2022 Compounds 8.II and 9.II are allylic derivatives of benzodioxole that differ in the presence of the double bond between the core and the carbonyl. However, this small structural modification does not seem to affect the anticancer activity against MDA-MB-231, HT-29, and DU-145 cancer cell lines. Molecule 8.II, the derivative presenting the benzodioxole core directly attached to the carbonyl, was shown to be more potent against the HTB-54 cell line (cell growth at 10 \u00b5M of 51.8% and 82.8% for 8.II and 9.II, respectively).\nCompound 10.II differs from compound 5.II in the presence of two acylselenourea functionalities substituted with the allylic chain. Molecule 5.II showed moderate-low anticancer activity, whereas the addition of another allylic acylselenourea moiety (10.II) led to a more potent derivative. Compound 10.II showed cell growth of 24.8, 47.7, 52.6, and 18.1% against MDA-MB-231, HT-29, HTB-54, and DU-145 cancer cell lines. On the other hand, compound 11.II differs from compound 10.II in that instead of presenting two acylselenourea groups, it presents only one together with an amide group. This compound, at 10 \u00b5M, showed cell growth higher than 77.0%, evidencing the crucial role played by the acylselenourea functional group in the anticancer activity. Compounds 1.I, 2.I, 5.I, 7.II, 10.II, 2.III, and 8.III were further tested at seven different concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 \u00b5M), after 48 h of treatment, in order to establish their dose\u2013response curve in lung HTB-54 cancer cells. The potential selectivity of these compounds was further investigated in a cell line derived from normal lung tissue (BEAS2B). Results are expressed as IC50 and the SI, calculated as the ratio of the IC50 values determined for the non-malignant and the tumor cells, respectively (IC50 (BEAS-2B)/IC50 (HTB-54)). The results are shown in Table 1.\nCisplatin 5.5 \u00b1 0.5 6.2 \u00b1 0.1 13.68 [32] 8.63 [33] 0.63 IC50 values are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments determined by the MTT assay. a SI calculates in lung cells as IC50 (BEAS-2B)/IC50 (HTB-54). b Not determined.\nCompounds 1.I and 5.I exhibited the most potent activity with IC50 values in lung cancer cells (HTB-54) < 10 \u00b5M, along with high SI towards malignant lung cancer cells (SI of >12.7 and >11.9, respectively). On the other hand, compound 2.I, which contains a thiophene ring with propyl chain, showed high cytotoxicity against normal lung tissue.\nDerivatives 2.III and 8.III from series III (propargyl) showed anticancer activity with IC50\nvalues of 11.6 and 21.7, respectively, against HTB-54 cells, with 8.III being more selective\ntowards malignant lung cancer cells (SI of 2.3 and >4.6, respectively). On the other hand, the introduction of the allyl chain (compounds 7.II and 10.II) led to potent cytotoxicity against normal lung tissue cells (BEAS-2B) with IC50 values of 6.3 and 29.9 \u00b5M. Thus, the SI for these compounds was low (0.5 and 0.7, respectively). Additionally, compounds 1.I and 5.I, which exhibited the highest SI towards malignant lung cancer cells, were also evaluated against MDA-MB-231 (breast) and DU-145 (prostate) cancer cell lines (Figure 6). Both compounds showed similar IC50 values of 8.8 \u00b5M and 9.5 \u00b5M for compound 1.I, and 15.5 \u00b5M and 11.5 \u00b5M for compound 5.I, against MDA-MB-231 and DU-145, respectively. As shown in Table 1, these two derivatives showed similar IC50 values to cisplatin, even better for HTB-54 cells, along with SI > 20 times higher than cisplatin towards normal lung tissue. Cisplatin was chosen as a reference because it is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents in the clinic.\nCell Lines\nCompoun s Breast Prostate Lung Lung\nMDA-MB-231 DU-145 HTB-54 BEAS-2B SI a\n1.I 8.8 \u00b1 4.8 9.5 \u00b1 2.5 7.8 \u00b1 12.7 >100 >12.7\n2.I n.d b n.d b 8.6 \u00b1 1.1 5.3 \u00b1 0.6 0.6\n5.I 15.5 \u00b1 6.3 11.5 \u00b1 3.4 8.4 \u00b1 3.9 >100 >11.9 7.II n.d b n.d b 12.0 \u00b1 2.7 6.3 \u00b1 1.5 0.5\n10.II n.d b n.d b 43. 0 \u00b1 4.1 29.9 \u00b1 5.0 0.7 2.III n.d b n.d b 11.6 \u00b1 1.6 26.6 \u00b1 4.0 2.3\n8.III n.d b n.d b 21.7 \u00b1 4.1 >100 >4.6\nCisplatin 5.5 \u00b1 0.5 6.2 \u00b1 0.1 13.68 [32] 8.63 [33] 0.63\nIC50 values are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments determined by the MTT assay.

Protective Effects against H2O2-Induced Cell Damage in DU-145 Cells\nCompounds 1.I, 2.I, 5.I, 7.II, and 10.II demonstrated the most potent DPPH inhibitory activity, along with cell growth below 55% in at least three of the four cancer cell lines tested. Therefore, they were selected to be evaluated in H2O2-damaged DU-145 cells at the concentrations of 0.0015 mg/mL and 0.0003 mg/mL using MTT assay (Figure 7). The latter concentrations were chosen because they maintain the antioxidant capacity of the compounds, but they were not toxic to the cells. Likewise, the DU-145 cancer cell line was chosen as it was the most sensitive to the compounds.\nOxidative damage was induced by three different concentrations of H2O2: 300, 250, and 200 \u00b5M. Whilst these hydrogen peroxide concentrations might not be relevant for mimicking the intracellular ROS levels on in vivo models, they were chosen to induce ample oxidative stress for inducing reasonable levels of cell death.\nPropyl derivatives including 1.I, 2.I, and 5.I doubled cell viability at the concentration of 0.0015 mg/mL in DU-145 cells treated with 300, 250, and 200 \u00b5M of H2O2.

Protectiv Effects against H2O2-Induced Cell Damage in DU-145 Cells\nCompounds 1.I, 2.I, 5.I, 7.II, and 10.II demonstrated the most potent DPPH inhibitory activity, along with cell growth below 55% in at least three of the four cancer cell lines tested. Therefore, they were selected to be evaluated in H2O2-damaged DU-145 cells at the concentrations of 0.0015 mg/mL and 0.0003 mg/mL using MTT assay (Figure 7). The latter concentrations were chosen because they maintain the antioxidant capacity of the compounds, but they were not toxic to the cells. Likewise, the DU-145 cancer cell line was chosen as it was the most sensitive to the compounds. Oxidative damage was i duced by thr e different concentrations of H2O2: 300, 250, and 200 \u00b5M. Whilst these hydrogen peroxide concentrations might ot be relevant for mimicking the intracellular ROS levels on in vivo models, they were chosen to induce ample oxidative stress for inducing reasonable levels of cell death. Propyl derivatives including 1.I, 2.I, and 5.I doubled cell viability at the concentration of 0.0015 mg/mL in DU-145 cells treated with 300, 250, and 200 \u00b5M of H2O2. Compound 2.I showed the most protective activity against H2O2-induced oxidative cell damage at the concentration of 0.0015 mg/mL, reaching fold increase values above 3.5. Likewise, compounds 5.I and 1.I showed no significant differences at the three different H2O2 concentrations compared to ascorbic acid. On the other hand, at the lowest concentration (0.0003 mg/mL), none of the compounds exhibited superior activity to ascorbic acid.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1331 16 of 23\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 24\nconcentration of 0.0015 mg/mL, reaching fold increase values above 3.5. Likewise, com-\npounds 5.I and 1.I showed no significant differences at the three different H2O2 concen-\ntrations compared to ascorbic acid. On the other hand, at the lowest concentration (0.0003\nmg/mL), none of the compounds exhibited superior activity to ascorbic acid.\nThe cell viability assays performed showed that compounds 1.I and 5.I exhibited an-\ntiproliferative activity and high SI, together with radical scavenging activity. To further\nconfirm if these compounds could induce cell death through apoptosis, we performed the\nAnnexin V Live & Dead Cell assay. During the induction of apoptosis, a progressive series\nof cellular biochemical and morphological changes occur, including the translocation of\nphosphatidylserine (PS) from the inside to the outside of the plasma membrane and its\nexposure to the external surface of the cell. This is a cell-type-independent phenomenon\nthat appears at the beginning of the apoptotic process. Annexin V has a high affinity for\nPS residues exposed on the cell surface, and is, therefore, routinely used to detect early\napoptosis [34]. On the other hand, late-stage apoptotic cells, in addition to translocation\nof PS to the outer membrane, also show a loss of membrane integrity. The dye 7-AAD,\nwith high affinity for DNA, is used to distinguish dead cells from early apoptotic cells\n[35]. Furthermore, apoptosis-induced cell death can be either caspase-dependent or\ncaspase-independent. To determine whether the apoptosis observed in the annexin V as-\nsay was caused by the activation of caspases, the caspase 3/7 assay was performed. Exe-\ncutioner caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 trigger the cleavage of many structural\nand regulatory proteins that arrest cellular functions, thus becoming hallmarks of apop-\ntosis [36]. The caspase 3/7 assay uses a DNA-binding dye that binds to a DEVD peptide\nsubstrate. This dye is unable to bind DNA when bound to the DEVD peptide. The cleavage\nof this bond by caspase 3/7 in apoptotic cells results in the release of the dye, its transloca-\ntion to the nucleus, and its binding to DNA. Likewise, this assay also included the dead\ncell marker 7-AAD.\nTherefore, DU-145 cells were treated with compounds 1.I and 5.I for 24 h at the con-\ncentration of 10 \u00b5M, and the results were obtained following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n3.4.3. Compounds 1.I and 5.I Induce Apoptosis in DU-145 C lls\nThe cell viability assays performed showed that compounds 1.I and 5.I exhibited antiproliferative activity and high SI, together with radical scavenging activity. To further confirm if these compounds could induce cell death through apoptosis, we performed the Annexin V Live & Dead Cell assay. During the induction of apoptosis, a progressive series of cellular biochemical and morphological changes occur, including the translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inside to the outside of the plasma membrane and its exposure to the external surface of the cell. This is a cell-type-independent phenomenon that appears at the beginning of the apoptotic process. Annexi V has a high affinity for PS residues exposed on the cel urface, and is, th refore, routinely used to detect early apoptosis [34]. On the other hand, late-stage apoptotic cells, in addition to translocation of PS to the outer membrane, also show a loss of membrane integrity. The dye 7-AAD, with high affinity for DNA, is used to distinguish dead cells from early apoptotic cells [35]. Furthermore, apoptosis-induced cell death can be either caspase-dependent or caspaseindependent. To determine whether the apoptosis observed in the annexin V assay was caused by the activation of caspases, the caspase 3/7 assay was performed. Executioner caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 trigger the cleavage of many structural and regulatory proteins that arrest cellular functions, thus becoming hallmarks of apoptosis [36]. The caspase 3/7 assay uses a DNA-binding dye that binds to a DEVD peptide substrate. This dye is unable to bind DNA when bound to the DEVD peptide. The cleavage of this bond by caspase 3/7 in apoptotic ells results in the release of he dye, its translocation to the nucleus, and its binding to DNA. Likewise, this ssay also included the dead cell marker 7-AAD. Therefore, DU-145 cells were treated with compounds 1.I and 5.I for 24 h at the concentration of 10 \u00b5M, and the results were obtained following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Four different cell populations were obtained in both assays: healthy cells (Annexin V, Caspase 3/7 and 7-AAD negative (lower left quadrant)); early apoptotic cells (both Annexin V and Caspase 3/7 positive and 7-AAD negative (lower right quadrant)); late apoptotic or dead cells (Annexin V, Caspase 3/7 and 7-AAD positive (upper right quadrant)); and necrotic cells (both Annexin V and Caspase 3/7 negative and 7-AAD positive (upper left quadrant)).\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1331 17 of 23\nResults obtained are shown in Figure 8, with a quantitative comparison of the difference in the cell population induced by each compound (Figure 8C,D). The cells treated with DMSO (control) were mainly located in the lower left quadrant, whereas treatment with compounds 1.I or 5.I induced a shift of healthy cells towards an apoptotic state. This shift was similar for both compounds at 10 \u00b5M in the Annexin V assay (Figure 8A), where viable population was reduced by 37%, while more than 40% of the cells were found to be apoptotic. The population of early apoptotic cells was about 3%, and the population of late/dead apoptotic cells increased with respect to the control by about 25% for both compounds (Figure 8A,C). Considering the Caspase 3/7 assay, both compounds exhibited similar behavior with a considerable increase in the population of apoptotic/dead cells (~40%) compared to the control (Figure 8B,D). Moreover, only a slight percentage of cells were necrotic, as there were almost no cells located in the upper left quadrant.

Compounds 1.I and 5.I Slightly Induce ROS Production during 24 h of Treatment\nAcylselenourea derivatives have shown to exhibit good radical scavenging activity, as previously reported by our research group [11]. On the other hand, it has been described that the anticancer effect of certain Se-containing molecules is associated with increased total ROS levels [30]. Thus, to investigate whether the induced cytotoxic effect of 1.I and\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1331 18 of 23\n5.I is related to ROS production, the total ROS level in DU-145 cells treated with 1.I and 5.I was performed. DU-145 cells were treated with DMSO, H2O2 (0.9 \u00b5M), 1.I (10 \u00b5M), and 5.I (10 \u00b5M) for 8, 16, and 24 h, and total ROS levels were measured. As shown in Figure 9, total ROS levels in cells treated with 5.I did not change significantly between the three time points, reaching at 8 h about 7%, and at 24 h about 11% of ROS(+) cells. Likewise, cells treated with 1.I exhibited a slight increase at 8 h in the ROS(+) cell population, reaching almost 20% compared to cells treated with 5.I. However, at 24 h, the percentage of ROS(+) cells decreased to about 12%. Therefore, no increase in ROS levels was observed that could be associated with the cytotoxic effect of 1.I and 5.I, supporting their possible role as radical scavengers. Previously, we evaluated the protective effect against H2O2-induced cell damage in DU-145 cells treated with 1.I and 5.I. Both the compounds showed protective activity against H2O2-induced oxidative cell damage at the concentration of 0.0015 mg/mL (equals to 5.78 \u00b5M and 5.57 \u00b5M for 1.I and 5.I, respectively), reaching a greater two-fold increase of cell survival. Therefore, a significant increase in total ROS levels may not be observed in cells treated with 1.I and 5.I at 10 \u00b5M, as they may be exerting radical scavenging activity.

Thus, the incorporation of the acylselenourea functional group has proven to be key for the design of free radical scavenger molecules.\nOn the other hand, we also evaluated the antiproliferative activity of the synthesized acylselenoureas against a panel of four cancer cell lines: HTB-54 (lung), MDA-MB-231 (breast), HT-29 (colon), and DU-145 (prostate). The latter cancer cell line was shown to be the most sensitive to the new compounds with eight of the 20 exhibiting less than 60% cell growth at 10 \u00b5M. In addition, the propyl derivatives (series I) showed higher cytotoxic activity. Among them, 1.I and 5.I also exhibited the highest SI in lung tissue, with values around 20-fold superior to cisplatin. These two compounds showed moderate-low IC50 values between 7.8 and 15.5 \u00b5M. Moreover, 1.I and 5.I demonstrated activity similar to ascorbic acid in the H2O2 -induced DU-145 cells oxidative damage model at 0.0015 mg/mL (equals to 5.78 \u00b5M and 5.57 \u00b5M for 1.I and 5.I, respectively). Hence, these new derivatives seem to be capable of exhibiting radical scavenging activity in cell culture. To further study the antiproliferative capacity of 1.I and 5.I, we evaluated whether they were able to induce apoptosis in the DU-145 cancer cell line at 10 \u00b5M. Both the compounds induced apoptosis with a clear involvement of caspase 3/7. Thus, their antiproliferative activity in DU-145 cells may be triggered by the caspase-mediated induction of apoptosis. Finally, to determine whether apoptosis could be induced by increased total ROS levels, they were measured by flow cytometry at different time points after exposure to 10 \u00b5M of 1.I and 5.I in DU-145 cells. Both the compounds showed a slight increase in total ROS levels that peaked at 16 h, with levels around 17% and 13%. However, they did not reach sufficient levels to likely be responsible for the induction of apoptosis."
