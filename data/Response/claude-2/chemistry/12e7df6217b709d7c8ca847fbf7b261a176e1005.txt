 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of different cations (e.g. imidazolium, pyridinium) on the CO2 absorption capacity and other physicochemical properties of ammonium-based protic ionic liquids. This can provide insights into how cation structure impacts performance.

2. Conduct a more in-depth study on the recyclability and reuse of the protic ionic liquids for CO2 capture over multiple cycles. This is important for evaluating their sustainability and process economics. 

3. Explore the use of mixed protic ionic liquid systems or blended amines to improve the CO2 absorption capacity and reduce the energy requirements for solvent regeneration.

4. Evaluate the performance of the protic ionic liquids for CO2 capture from flue gas streams containing other components like N2, O2, SOx, NOx. This has more practical relevance for carbon capture from power plants.

5. Conduct pilot or demonstration scale trials using the best performing protic ionic liquids to evaluate process design parameters and engineering challenges associated with scale-up. This provides critical data for eventual commercialization.
