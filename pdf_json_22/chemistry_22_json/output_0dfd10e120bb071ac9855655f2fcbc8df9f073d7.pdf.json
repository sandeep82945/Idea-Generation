Application by subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or oral routes is an important alternative and may yield comparable or favorable organ and tumor radioligand uptake. Here, we assessed organ and tumor biodistribution for various radioligand application routes in healthy mice and models of cancer expressing somatostatin receptor (SSTR), prostate-specificmembrane antigen (PSMA), and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). Methods: Healthy and tumor-bearing male C57BL/6 or NOD SCID g-mice, respectively, were administered a mean of 6.0 6 0.5MBq of 68GaDOTATOC (RM1-SSTR allograft), 5.3 6 0.3MBq of 68Ga-PSMA11 (RM1-PSMA allograft), or 4.8 6 0.2MBq of 68Ga-FAPI46 (HT1080FAP xenograft) by intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or oral routes. In vivo PET images and ex vivo biodistribution in tumor, organs, and the injection site were assessed up to 5 h after injection. Healthy mice were monitored for up to 7 d after the last scan for signs of stress or adverse reactions. Results: After intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous radioligand administration, average residual activity at the injection site was less than 17 percentage injected activity per gram (%IA/g) at 1 h after injection, less than 10 %IA/g at 2 h after injection, and no more than 4 %IA/g at 4 h after injection for all radioligands. After oral administration, at least 50 %IA/g remained within the intestines until 4 h after injection. Biodistribution in organs of healthy mice was nearly equivalent after intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous application at 1 h after injection and all subsequent time points (#1 %IA/g for liver, blood, and bone marrow; 11.2 6 1.4 %IA/g for kidneys). In models for SSTR-, PSMA- and FAP-expressing cancer, tumor uptake was increased or equivalent for intraperitoneal/subcutaneous versus intravenous injection at 5 h after injection (ex vivo): SSTR, 7.2 6 1.0 %IA/g (P 5 0.0197)/6.5 6 1.3 %IA/g (P 5 0.0827) versus 2.9 6 0.3 %IA/g, respectively; PSMA, 3.4 6 0.8 %IA/g (P 5 0.9954)/3.9 6 0.8 %IA/g (P 5 0.8343) versus 3.3 6 0.7% IA/g, respectively; FAP, 1.1 6 0.1 %IA/g (P 5 0.9805)/ 1.16 0.1 %IA/g (P5 0.7446) versus 1.06 0.2 %IA/g, respectively. Conclusion: In healthy mice, biodistribution of small theranostic ligands after intraperitoneal/subcutaneous application is nearly equivalent to that after intravenous injection. Subcutaneous administration resulted in the highest absolute SSTR tumor and tumor-to-organ uptake as compared with the intravenous route, warranting further clinical assessment.\nKey Words: radioligand; biodistribution; small-animal PET; theranostic; intravenous; subcutaneous"

Recently, fibroblast activation protein (FAP)\u2013targeting small ligands have emerged for PET and therapy of cancers (4). Intravenous application is the standard route for radioligands. However, oral, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous administrations are faster and require a lower level of training than does intravenous administration, both in the preclinical and in the clinical settings. The volume of preclinical and clinical radioligand applications is growing rapidly, and thus, there is an urgent unmet need to assess alternative application routes to address the increasing demand. In addition, the field of FAP-directed therapies is dynamic and evolving, highlighting the emerging need for optimization of administration routes for these novel radioligands for ongoing preclinical and clinical assessment. With this intent, assessment of biodistribution and administration routes for 68Ga-FAPI46 (FAP inhibitor [FAPI]) was requested by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices for recent approval of a prospective clinical trial on 68Ga-FAPI46 PET/CT for various types of cancer (NCT04571086). We hypothesized that intraperitoneal/subcutaneous application would yield organ and tumor biodistribution nearly equivalent to that of the routine intravenous injection. We further hypothesized that organ and tumor uptake would be significantly lower after oral application of radioligands. Here, we compare tumor and organ biodistribution after intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and oral application of small radioligands in healthy mice and mouse models of SSTR-, PSMA-, and FAP-expressing cancer."

In mice bearing SSTR tumors, intraperitoneal/subcutaneous application resulted in significantly higher mean tumor uptake than did intravenous application: P 5 0.0124 and 0.0377, respectively, at 1 h; P 5 0.0301 and 0.0411, respectively, at 4 h; and P 5 0.0197 and 0.0827, respectively, at 5 h [ex vivo]) (Table 1; Supplemental Fig. 4). Tumor uptake of 68Ga-PSMA11 or 68Ga-FAPI46 after intraperitoneal/subcutaneous injection in mice bearing PSMAor FAP-expressing tumors was comparable to the uptake observed after intravenous injection (Table 1). Oral administration in mice bearing FAP-expressing tumors did not result in notable tumor uptake (Table 1; Supplemental Fig. 4). Oral application of 68Ga-FAPI46 in tumor-bearing mice yielded biodistribution characteristics comparable to those seen in healthy mice (Supplemental Fig. 4), with high gastrointestinal retention of the radioligand and low systemic distribution. Tumor-to-organ uptake ratios of organs relevant to dosimetry (9,10) for intraperitoneal/subcutaneous versus intravenous application are depicted in Figures 5\u20137. Intraperitoneal/subcutaneous application resulted in increased or equivalent tumor-to-liver ratios at 5 h after injection when compared with intravenous (mean ratio 5 h after injection): 68Ga-DOTATOC: 27.4 6 2.2-fold (P 5 0.0138)/25.3 6 5.6-fold (P 5 0.2756) versus 13.9 6 2.9-fold, respectively; 68GaPSMA11: 28.2 6 7.4-fold (P 5 0.4504)/39.4 6 5.7-fold (P 5 0.0259) versus 16.9 6 2.8-fold, respectively; and 68Ga-FAPI46: 6.1 6 1.6-fold (P 5 0.4198)/12.0 6 1.1-fold (P 5 0.0005) versus 3.7 6 0.4-fold, respectively (Figs. 5\u20137).

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The current delivery method for radioligands for nuclear imaging or therapy is intravenous injection. However, comparing different application routes is important for the translation of novel FAP ligands and optimization of current clinical protocols for PSMA or SSTR ligands. The current study aimed at comparing the biodistribution of SSTR-, PSMA-, and FAP-directed small radioligands administered intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, or orally with the standard intravenous application. Alternative application routes may alter systemic distribution and tumor uptake (11\u201313), such as by slowing absorption because of a reduced rate of molecular transport via the lymphatics and blood flow to the organs of interest or tumor (14). Administration of small radioligands intravenously, intraperitoneally, and subcutaneously was feasible and well tolerated as assessed by a scoring system including the behavior and overall physical appearance of mice. Small-radioligand systemic availability and biodistribution were comparable for intraperitoneal/subcutaneous versus intravenous application (Fig. 1\u20134). In addition,\n1360 THE JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE Vol. 63 No. 9 September 2022\nintraperitoneal/subcutaneous administration in mice resulted in significantly higher 68Ga-DOTATOC tumor uptake (Table 1), tumorto-liver ratio, and tumor-to-marrow ratio in SSTR-expressing tumors than was the case with intravenous injection (Fig. 5). These findings have implications for preclinical and clinical radioligand administration, since they could offer advantages for both fields. In mice, intravenous injection requires highly trained personnel and is more error-prone (e.g., paravenous injection) and time-consuming. Intraperitoneal/subcutaneous administration may serve as simple alternative application routes for imaging at later time points after injection or therapy, allowing a higher throughput in mouse studies, with lower dropout rates and high reproducibility. In mice, intraperitoneal administration did not compromise radioligand tumor accumulation despite a high initial absorbed dose in the intestines (15). However, because of slower systemic bioavailability after intraperitoneal/subcutaneous injection, intravenous application is recommended for early dynamic imaging. In clinical routine, use of alternatives to intravenous application may improve outpatient care and benefit potential new therapy schemes, allowing repeat radioligand application at short intervals. In patients, intraperitoneal application is limited by a higher likelihood of infection or abdominal organ damage. However, subcutaneous application is already well established as a standard route for injectable medications in outpatients and has an emerging role in delivery of biotherapeutics and monoclonal antibodies (16,17). Indeed, in patients with accidental paravenous infusion of 177Lu-DOTATOC, absorption from the paravenous injection site occurs with a half-life of less than 4 h (Supplemental Fig. 6); this is in line with a short drainage observed after subcutaneous injection in mice. We therefore expect that subcutaneous application in patients would be feasible. Still, an increased radiation dose to organs such as kidneys, bone marrow, blood, lungs, or liver may limit benefit from intraperitoneal/\nBIODISTRIBUTION OF 68GA-LIGANDS Klose et al. 1361\nsubcutaneous injection. However, if radioligand therapy regimens were changed to a weekly or biweekly schedule using subcutaneous application, activities for each administration could probably be reduced in favor of these more frequent treatments. Weekly or biweekly intraperitoneal/subcutaneous application could be realized by outpatient care, reducing the patient\u2019s time in the hospital, personnel capacities, and, thus, costs. In this study, uptake in nontarget tissues did not exceed critical values or radiation dose as suggested from measured uptake in %IA/g (Figs. 2\u20134). Therefore, we assume that a detrimental radiation burden to organs at risk (mainly kidneys) after intraperitoneal/subcutaneous application when compared with the standard intravenous route is unlikely. Notably, preclinical and clinical studies for DOTATOC- and PSMA-targeting radiotherapies demonstrated that after intravenous administration, absorbed doses in organs at risk are not likely to cause relevant radiotoxicity (9,10,18,19). However, to precisely estimate the additional absorbed dose to the adjacent tissue (by the intraperitoneal/subcutaneous route) after radioligand therapy, further studies with 177Lu-labeled ligands and quantitative preclinical SPECT imaging should be performed. Yet, if we assume a half-life of 2.3 h for the change in local activity over time at the injection site, as recently published by Tylski et al. (20), we would not expect to detect a change in dosimetry between 1 177Lu administration and, for example, 2\u20133 administrations spaced by 48 h. To date, the entire theranostics routine is based on rather conservative application schemes with few possibilities of patient-specific modification. Our observation that subcutaneous application showed similar tumor uptake to intravenous application may open new opportunities for alternative application schemes in the clinical routine\u2014for example, weekly or biweekly applications, which are less feasible if using repeat intravenous injections. Also, subcutaneous application is faster and easier than intravenous and could thus be realized in outpatient care by medical laboratory assistants in a timeefficient manner for both patient and clinic personnel. Furthermore, it would be interesting to investigate the influence of intravenous application rate (applied dose per time) on tumor uptake. This investigation could be realized in a clinical study or observational trial on patients with poor vein status. This study had some limitations. It assessed 68Ga-ligands for PET imaging and did not examine therapeutic 177Lu-labeled ligands. Furthermore, in-bed injection with concurrent dynamic PET acquisition was not performed, and because of the short 68Ga half-life, time points beyond 5 h after injection were not feasible."
