SHANK3 is a synaptic scaffolding protein and mutations of SHANK3 are involved in ASD. Shank3 expression in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons also regulates heat pain and touch. However, the role of Shank3 in the vagus system remains unknown. We induced systemic inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and measured body temperature and serum IL-6 levels in mice. We found that homozygous and heterozygous Shank3 deficiency, but not Shank2 and Trpv1 deficiency, aggravates hypothermia, systemic inflammation (serum IL-6 levels), and sepsis mortality in mice, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, these deficits can be recapitulated by specific deletion of Shank3 in Nav1.8-expressing sensory neurons in conditional knockout (CKO) mice or by selective knockdown of Shank3 or Trpm2 in vagal sensory neurons in nodose ganglion (NG). Mice with Shank3 deficiency have normal basal core temperature but fail to adjust body temperature after perturbations with lower or higher body temperatures or auricular vagus nerve stimulation. In situ hybridization with RNAscope revealed that Shank3 is broadly expressed by vagal sensory neurons and this expression was largely lost in Shank3 cKO mice. Mechanistically, Shank3 regulates the expression of Trpm2 in NG, as Trpm2 but not Trpv1 mRNA levels in NG were significantly reduced in Shank3 KO mice. Our findings demonstrated a novel molecular mechanism by which Shank3 in vagal sensory neurons regulates body temperature, inflammation, and sepsis. We also provided new insights into inflammation dysregulation in ASD.\nKEYWORDS\nautism, nodose ganglion, sepsis, TRPM2, TRPV1, vagus nerve, pain, inflammation\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by persistent deficits in the ability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication and characterized by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behavior, as well as various sensory abnormalities (1\u20135). SHANK3 is a scaffolding protein located at excitatory synapses, and mutations of SHANK3 (haploinsufficiency) may account for 1-2% of all ASD cases including Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) (2, 6, 7). The disrupted striatum centered brain structures and synaptic transmission in this brain region are associated with ASD children with SHANK3 mutations and animal models of Shank3 deficiency (2, 4, 8, 9).\nAccumulating evidence has indicated the link between ASD and generalized immune dysfunction (hyper-inflammation). For example, proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8) are increased in the brains of ASD individuals (10). Peripheral bloodmononuclear cells from ASD patients produced more TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 than control cells (11). The plasma and serum concentrations of IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 are also elevated in ASD samples compared with the healthy control samples (12). Upregulations of IL\u20106 and IL\u201017 levels were reported in pregnant rodent mothers upon maternal immune activation and IL\u20106 may induce the secretion of IL\u201017 (3). IL-6 and IL-17 were shown to promote autistic behaviors in animal models (3, 13\u201315). By contrast, anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-17 treatments can alleviate the autistic behaviors induced by maternal immune activation (3, 14). Frequent respiratory infections were found in 57% of ASD patients and regarded as an ASD comorbidity (4). Anti-biotic treatment may improve ASD-related behaviors (16\u201318). Subacute neuropsychiatric syndrome in girls with SHANK3 mutations responds to immunomodulation (19). Preclinical study shows that acute inflammatory challenge induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can unmask behavioral deficits of Shank3+/\u2212 mice (7). However, the mechanisms of excessive immune reaction in ASD are not fully understood.\nEmerging roles for the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis have been implicated in ASD (18, 20, 21). Notably, the vagus system plays a critical role in regulating the gut-brain axis (18, 22, 23). Precision microbial-based therapy was shown to rescue social deficits in mouse models of ASD and, interestingly this rescue in Shank3B knockout mice depends upon the function of the vagus nerve (20). The molecular mechanisms underlying the vagus nerve modulation of ASD remain largely unknown. Recent studies have shown SHANK3 expression in the peripheral nervous system, such as primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG); and furthermore, SHANK3 interacts with transient receptor potential ion channel V1 (TRPV1) and GABAA receptor in DRG neurons to regulate pain (24) and touch (25). Here we show that Shank3 is also expressed by vagal sensory neurons and Shank3 in nodose ganglion (NG) sensory neurons plays a crucial role in maintaining body temperature and protecting against systemic inflammation in responses to LPS challenge and temperature perturbations. Mechanistically, SHANK3 regulates the expression of TRPM2 (transient receptor potential melastatin 2), a nonselective Ca2+ permeable cation channel in NG vagal sensory neurons.\nFrontiers in Immunology 02"

Both Shank2 and Shank3 floxed mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for more than 10 generations. To generate sensory neuron-specific deletion of Shank3 and Shank2, the flox mice were crossed with Nav1.8-cre mice, provided by Dr. Rohini Kuner of University of Heidelberg (27). Adult mice (males and females, 8\u201310 weeks) were used for behavioral and biochemical studies. CD1 mice (males and females, 8\u201310 weeks, Charles River Laboratories) were used for some siRNA knockdown experiments. All the mouse procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee of Duke University. Two to five mice were housed in each cage under a 12-hour alternating light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Sample sizes were estimated based on our previous studies for similar types of behavioral and biochemical analyses (24, 28).\nPeri-neural injection of virus or siRNA in the vagus nerve\nThe siRNA preparation and injection were conducted as we previously described (29). For siRNA delivery to the vagus nerve, we mixed 100 nM siRNA with 1 \u00b5M RVG peptide that can facilitate siRNA uptake by neurons (30). For AAV9 virus delivery to vagus nerve, we mixed 1 x 109 virus in 10 \u00b5l of PBS. The vagal nerve was exposed as previously described (31). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and a midline cervical muscle and salivary glands were exposed by blunt dissection until the trachea was visible. The vagus nerve was gently separated from the artery, and bilateral peri-neural injections were conducted to deliver siRNA or virus (5 ml) using a glass electrode with tip size of 1 \u00b5m. The knockdown effects of siRNA and AAV9 virus were validated by examining the expression of Shank3, Trpm2, and Trpv1 in vagal sensory neurons in nodose ganglion (NG) using in situ hybridization.\nfrontiersin.org"

            "text": "LPS-induced hypothermia, systemic inflammation and mortality are aggravated in Shank3 global knockout mice\nTo investigate an overall role of Shank3 in LPS-induced hypothermia, inflammation, and mortality, we employed Shank3 \u25b3e4-22 mutant mice, in which exons 4 to 22 were deleted and SHANK3 protein is completely lost (8). In the current study, we referred to \u25b3e4-22 mutant mice as Shank3 global knockout mice (GKO). First, we compared the baseline body temperature in wild-type (WT) and heterozygous (Shank3+/-) and homozygous (Shank3-/-) GKO mice. The rectal temperature analysis revealed that Shank3-/- mice exhibited no change in body core temperature as compared to WT and Shank3+/-mice (Figure 1A), suggesting that SHANK3 is not involved in the regulation of basal body temperature. Then, we challenged these mice with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS (1 mg/kg) to induce sepsis (28). Herein, we found a rapid and transient hyperthermia in WT mice, as indicated by an elevation in rectal temperature at 30 minutes after LPS injection as compared to baseline (p = 0.0158, Figure 1A). Interestingly, this hyperthermia was completely compromised in both Shank3+/- and Shank3-/- mice (p = 0.0106 and p = 0.0004, respectively) when compared with WT mice (Figure 1A). We also revealed that LPSinduced hypothermia started at 3 hours (p = 0.0008), peaked at 6 hours (p < 0.0001), and continued for 24 hours (p=0.0488) after LPS intervention in WT mice. Furthermore, as compared to WT mice, this hypothermia was observed within 1 hour (p = 0.0411) and lasted for at least 48 hours (p < 0.0001) after LPS exposure in Shank3-/- mice. More strikingly, sepsis-induced hypothermia was significantly aggravated in both Shank3+/- and Shank3-/- mice (F (2, 408) = 48.24, p < 0.0001, twoway ANOVA, Figure 1A). There was also significant difference between heterozygous and homozygous mice (F (1, 245) = 11.35, p = 0.0011, twoway ANOVA, Figure 1A). This result suggested that loss of one copy of Shank3 is sufficient to cause hyperthermia defects and hypothermia exacerbation, which is reminiscent of autism patients with haploinsufficiency of SHANK3.\nNext, we investigated whether sepsis-induced systemic inflammation was altered in Shank3 mutant mice. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 is well recognized as a biomarker for sepsis and sepsis-associated death (28). We detected robust increases of serum IL-6 levels at 6 hours after LPS injection in Shank3-/- mice as compared to WT mice (F (1, 24) = 0.1450, p = 0.008226, two-way ANOVA, Figure 1B).\nAlso, we evaluated survival rate following LPS injection among three genotypes. Low-dose LPS at 1 mg/kg resulted in a very low mortality (10%, Figure 1C) inWTmice. As compared toWTmice, we found a slight increase (23.33%) in mortality in LPS-treated Shank3+/-\nFrontiers in Immunology 04\nmice (p = 0.1062, Figure 1C) but a significant increase (37.37%) in mortality in LPS-treated Shank3-/- mice (p = 0.0152, Figure 1C). Collectively, these data indicate that SHANK3 confers protection against hypothermia, systemic inflammation and septic death following LPS injection.\nShank3 deletion in vagal sensory neurons exacerbates LPS-induced hypothermia, systemic inflammation, and mortality\nVagus nerve stimulation has been shown to protect against sepsis and systemic inflammation (22). Recent studies reported Shank3 expression in peripheral sensory neurons of DRG (24, 25). However, the expression and role of SHANK3 in the vagus system is unclear. Using a sensitive RNA scope assay, we found extensive Shank3 mRNA expression in majority of vagal sensory neurons in nodose ganglia (NG, Figure 2A). To evaluate an underlying contribution of peripheral SHANK3 to hypothermia regulation, we generated Shank3 conditional knockout mice by crossing Shank3floxed mice with Nav1.8-Cre mice, leading to specific deletion of Shank3 in Nav1.8-expressing peripheral sensory neurons including NG neurons (33). In this study, we referred to Shank3f/f mice as littermate control wildtype (WT) mice, and referred to Nav1.8-cre; Shank3f/+ and Nav1.8-cre; Shank3f/f mice as Shank3 conditional knockout (CKO) heterozygous and homozygous mice. Notably, Shank3 expression was substantially reduced in CKO mice (Nav1.8cre; Shank3f/f mice) as compared to Shank3f/f mice (p = 0.0017, Figures 2A, B). This result indicates a selective expression of Shank3 in NG sensory neurons and also validated Shank3 CKO mice.\nAs in GKO mice, body temperature analysis revealed no difference of basal body temperature between WT and CKO mice (Figure 2C), suggesting that Shank3 in sensory neurons does not contribute to basal body temperature. We next compared hypothermia phenotypes after LPS injection in three genotypes of WT and CKO mice. Herein, we reported a rapid and transient hyperthermia in Shank3f/f mice, as indicated by the elevation in rectal temperature at 30 minutes after LPS injection as compared to baseline (p = 0.0473, Figure 2C). Interestingly, this hyperthermia was completely compromised in both heterozygous and homozygous CKO mice (p = 0.0025 and p < 0.0001, respectively) when compared with Shank3f/f mice. Furthermore, homozygous CKO mice exhibited more rapid (within 1 hour, p=0.0038) and more lasting (>48 hours, p < 0.0001) hypothermia, as compared to Shank3f/f mice (Figure 2C), suggesting that Shank3 deficiency in sensory neurons accelerates the induction of hypothermia and delays the resolution of hypothermia after sepsis. Intriguingly, sepsis-induced hypothermia was significantly aggravated in both heterozygous and homozygous CKO mice (F (2, 448) = 58.38, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Figure 2C). There was also significant difference between heterozygous and homozygous CKO mice (F (1, 286) = 16.47, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Figure 2C). More strikingly, Shank3 CKO mice exhibited more remarkable changes (reductions) in rectal temperature when compared with Shank3 GKO (p = 0.0136, Figure 2D), suggesting a dominant role of peripheral SHANK3 in temperature regulation.\nfrontiersin.org\nNext, we investigated whether LPS-induced systemic inflammation would also be affected in Shank3 CKO mice. Serum IL-6 levels did not differ at 3 hours and 6 hours after LPS stimulation in WT and CKO mice. At 24 hours, IL-6 levels returned to baseline in WT mice but remained at the peak in CKO (F (3, 40) = 29.21, p = 0.0002, two-way ANOVA, Figure 2E). Survival rate analysis showed that LPS significantly increased mortality (42.90%) in homozygous CKO mice (p=0.0083, vs. WT, Figure 2F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that SHANK3 in Nav1.8-expressing peripheral sensory neurons confers protection against hypothermia, systemic inflammation and septic death after sepsis.\nFrontiers in Immunology 05\nSHANK3 in peripheral vagal sensory neurons is required for maintaining the homeostasis of core temperature\nTo investigate a specific role of peripheral SHANK3 in regulating body temperature, we challengedWT and Shank3 CKOmice in different conditions of hypothermia and hyperthermia, including cold room habituation at 4\u00b0C (Figure 3A), 5% isoflurane anesthesia (Figure 3B), intrathecal injection of PGE2 (200 ng, Figure S3), 5%menthol application to the back and auricular region (Figures 3C, D), and auricular application of 100 mM capsaicin (Figure 3E).

Interestingly, CKO mice exhibited rapid hypothermia compared to WT mice (F (2, 92) = 10.54, p < 0.05 vs. WT, Figure 3A). Brief anesthesia to 5% isoflurane produced a rapid drop in body temperature in 10 min, but no difference was found between three genotypes (F (2, 42) = 3.094, p = 0.0558, two-way ANOVA, Figure 3B). Intrathecal PGE2 induced hyperthermia and fever in WT mice, which was impaired in Shank3 CKO mice (F (2, 48) = 3.835, p = 0.0285, two-way ANOVA, Figure S1). Next, we observed a rapid and transient hyperthermia after 5% menthol smearing in body trunk in Shank3f/fmice (Figure 3C). This hyperthermia at 30min was partially attenuated in homozygous CKOmice (p = 0.0218, vs. WT), although we did not observe any significant difference among three genotypes (F (2, 80) = 1.776, p = 0.176, two-way ANOVA,\nFrontiers in Immunology 06\nFigure 3C). Next, we smeared 5% menthol to auricular vagal region to mimic vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS, Figure 3D). This cold/cool stimulation induced hyperthermia in WT mice but not in homozygous CKO mice (F (1, 56) = 12.85, p = 0.0007, two-way ANOVA, Figure 3D), which was consistent with the results in Shank3GKOmice (Figure S2A). Similarly, aVNS with 100 mM capsaicin smearing produced hyperthermia in Shank3f/f mice, which was compromised in both heterozygous and homozygous CKO mice (F (2, 92) = 22.51, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Figure 3E). The same result was also observed in Shank3 GKO mice (Figure S2B).\nNext, we recorded electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess VNSinduced heart rate (HR) change following auricular menthol smearing (Figure 3F). As expected, menthol-induced VNS resulted in a significant decrease of HR in WT Shank3f/f mice, which was abolished in homozygous CKO mice (F (1, 14) = 11.73, p = 0.0041,\nA B\nD E F\nC\nFIGURE 2 LPS-induced hypothermia, systemic inflammation and mortality are aggravated in Shank3 CKO C57BL/6 mice.

Col lect ive ly , these detailed results suggest that peripheral Shank3 in vagal sensory nerve plays an important role in maintaining core temperature following perturbations.\nSelective SHANK3 knockdown in vagal sensory neurons exacerbates LPS-induced hypothermia, systemic inflammation and mortality\nSHANK3 is expressed by different types of peripheral sensory neurons in mouse DRG, NG, and trigeminal ganglia (34). To confirm a specific role of peripheral SHANK3 in vagal nerve for regulating the LPS-induced effects, we used Shank3 siRNA to knockdown endogenous SHANK3 expression in vagal sensory neurons in NG. A short peptide derived from rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) has been utilized to facilitate siRNA uptake by neurons including sensory neurons and enhance knockdown efficiency of siRNA (29, 30). We performed bilateral peri-vagal nerve delivery of Shank3 siRNA (mixed with the RVG peptide, 1:10) in CD1 mice (Figure 4A). In situ hybridization (ISH) revealed a profound reduction in Shank3 mRNA in NG neurons following Shank3 siRNA (100 nM) treatment (F (2, 9) = 48.70, p = 0.0002, one-way ANOVA, Figure 4B), suggesting the successful establishment of SHANK3 knockdown by siRNA. We next challenged these mice with LPS on 3 days following siRNA injection. Intriguingly, we found that LPSinduced transient hyperthermia in control siRNA treated mice was completely lost after Shank3 siRNA treatment (p < 0.0001, Figure 4C). Moreover, LPS-induced hypothermia was significantly aggravated by vagal SHANK3 knockdown (F (1, 75) = 90.52, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, vs. control siRNA, Figure 4C). Peri-vagal Shank3 siRNA (50 nM, 100 nM and 200 nM) enhanced LPS-induced hypothermia in a dose-dependent manner (F (5, 297) = 53.45, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Figure S3A). Furthermore, we detected a robust increase of serum IL-6 levels at 3 hours after LPS injection (p = 0.0027, Shank3 siRNA vs. control siRNA, Figure 4D). However, we did not detect any difference of mortality between control siRNA and Shank3 siRNA treatment, as CD1 mice are more resistant to sepsis than C57BL/6 mice (Figures S3B\u2013D).\nNext, we employed GFP fluorescence-labeled AAV9-Cre virus to produce a more persistent knockdown of endogenous SHANK3 expression in vagal sensory neurons, by using bilateral peri-vagal nerve delivery of AAV9 Cre virus in Shank3f/f mice (Figure 4E). Perivagal nerve injection of GFP-labeled AAV9 Cre virus resulted in uptake of AAV9 Cre virus in NG neurons as a result of axonal transport from the vagal nerve (Figure S4A). Simultaneously, we detected a profound reduction in Shank3 mRNA in NG neurons following the same treatment (p = 0.0002, Figures S4A\u2013C), manifesting the successful establishment of SHANK3 knockdown by Cre virus in Shank3f/f mice. We next challenged these mice with LPS at 2 weeks following the virus injection. We found that the Cre virus treatment abolished the LPS-induced transient hyperthermia (p = 0.002 vs. control virus) and exacerbated the LPS-induced hypothermia (F (1, 89) = 36.12, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, vs. control virus, Figure 4F). Moreover, the Shank3 virus treated mice exhibited a significant increase of serum IL-6 levels (F (1, 24) = 10.18,\nFrontiers in Immunology 07\np = 0.0039, Two-Way ANOVA, vs. control virus, Figure 4G) following LPS challenge. Vagal SHANK3 knockdown by Cre virus treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in survival rate after LPS intervention in Shank3f/f mice (p = 0.0274, vs. control virus, Figure 4H). Collectively, these data indicate that SHANK3 in vagal sensory neurons confers protection against LPS-induced hypothermia, systemic inflammation and septic death.\nSHANK3 regulates core temperature and systemic inflammation via TRPM2\nTRP channels are thermosensors in peripheral nervous system and detect ambient temperature changes (35, 36). First, we employed quantitative RT-PCR to measure mRNA expressions of Trpm2, Trpv1, Trpv4, Trpm8 and Scn10A (encoding Nav1.8) in NG of WT and GKO mice. Interestingly, we detected a robust reduction in Trpm2 (p = 0.00754) but not Trpv1, Trpv4, Trpm8 and Scn10A mRNA levels in NG of Shank3\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5A). ISH revealed a broad expression of Trpm2mRNA in majority of NG neurons in WT mice, but this expression was significantly lower in Shank3\u2212/\u2212 mice (p < 0.05, vs. WT, Figure 5B).\nTo further verify the potential role of peripheral TRPM2 in vagal nerve in sepsis-induced hypothermia, Trpm2 siRNA (100 nM) was employed to knockdown endogenous TRPM2 expression in vagal sensory neurons of CD1 mice through bilateral peri-vagal nerve delivery (Figure 5C). ISH detected a significant reduction in Trpm2 mRNA in NG neurons following the siRNA treatment (p = 0.01331, Figure 5D). Following LPS challenge, Trpm2 siRNA treatment exacerbated hypothermia (F (1, 150) = 120.4, P < 0.0001, vs. control siRNA, Figure 5E) and increased serum IL-6 levels (F (1, 39) = 39.31, p < 0.0001, vs. control siRNA, Figure 5F), without affecting mortality in CD1 mice (Figure 5G). Together, these data indicate that 1) TRPM2 is a downstream event of SHANK3 signaling in NG neurons and 2) loss of TRPM2 in vagal sensory neurons can recapitulate some of the key features of SHANK3 knockdown, including hypothermia and systemic IL-6 increase.\nSHANK2 or TRPV1 deficiency in peripheral sensory neurons fails to alter body temperature homeostasis and systemic inflammation\nDysfunction of SHANK2 protein is also a critical step for the development of autistic-like behaviors (2, 37). We therefore investigated whether SHANK2 is involved in LPS and menthol induced thermal regulation using Shank2 CKO mice with Shank2 deletion in Nav1.8+ sensory neurons. We did not find significant differences in LPS-induced hypothermia (F (2, 124) = 0.1497, p = 0.8611, two-way ANOVA, Figure 6A) and survival rate (Figure S5A) between littermate control mice (Shank2f/f) and CKO mice (Nav1.8cre; Shank2f/+ and Nav1.8-cre; Shank2f/f). In parallel, we did not observe significant differences in menthol-induced hyperthermia (F (2, 64) = 0.3973, p = 0.6738, two-way ANOVA, Figure 6B), capsaicininduced hyperthermia (Figure S5B), and anesthesia-induced\nfrontiersin.org\nhypothermia (Figure S5C). Thus, Shank2 in peripheral sensory neurons is not involved in the regulation of body core temperature.\nGiven a functional link between SHANK3 and TRPV1 in DRG primary sensory neurons and heat sensation (24), we evaluated whether peripheral TRPV1 is important for sepsis-induced hypothermia. Trpv1 siRNA was employed to knockdown endogenous TRPV1 expression in NG neurons via peri-vagal nerve delivery in CD1 mice. ISH detected a substantial reduction in Trpv1 mRNA in NG neurons following Trpv1 siRNA (100 nM) injection [F (2, 9) = 115.8, p < 0.0001, Figure 6C]. Compared to the control siRNA, Trpv1 siRNA had no significant effects on LPS-induced hypothermia\nFrontiers in Immunology 08\n(F (1, 70) = 0.648, p = 0.4235, two-way ANOVA, Figure 6D) and serum expressions of IL-6 (F (1, 18) = 0.3131, p = 0.5827, Figure 6E). These findings suggest that TRPV1 in vagal sensory neurons is not required for sepsis-induced hypothermia, systemic inflammation, and mortality."

These pain deficits were fully recapitulated in Shank3+/- CKO mice with Shank3 deficiency in sensory neurons (24). In the present study, Shank3+/GKO and CKOmice also exhibited significant deficits in LPS-induced hypothermia and systemic inflammation, albeit Shank3-/- GKO and CKO mice had more robust phenotypes. Furthermore, genetically vulnerable Shank3+/- mice, when challenged with LPS to induce an acute inflammatory response, showed robust circuit and behavioral alterations related to ASD (7).\nApart from genetic risk factors, studies also support the hypothesis of immune dysregulation in ASD (3). Especially, IL-6 and IL-17 were upregulated in ASD individuals or animal models of ASD and contribute to autistic behaviors in animal models (3, 13\u2013 15). Furthermore, blocking these cytokines with neutralizing\nFrontiers in Immunology 10\nantibodies were shown to alleviate autistic behaviors (3, 14). Frequent respiratory infections were found in 57% of ASD patients and regarded as an ASD comorbidity (4). Devastating symptoms were reported in some PMS patients after acute infections or stressful environmental challenges (38). Several clinical studies reported improvements in ASD behaviors following antibiotic treatments (16\u201318) and immunomodulation (19). Low dose LPS challenge (1-2 mg/kg) induces systemic inflammation (\u201ccytokine storm\u201d) and neuroinflammation and exacerbates ASD symptoms in Shank3+/- mice (7). We found that IL-6 is significantly dysregulated (upregulated) after Shank3 deficiency, in response to LPS challenge. It will be of great interest to examine the changes of these cytokines in the brain and CSF, which could drive some ASD symptoms.\nA B\nD\nE F G\nC\nFIGURE 5 SHANK3 regulates body temperature and inflammation via TRPM2 in C57BL/6 mice (A, B) and CD1 mice (C\u2013G).

Microbial-based therapy has been used to treat social deficits in mouse models of ASD and the vagus nerve is required for this therapeutic effect in Shank3B knockout mice (20). VNS is a safe and effective therapy for pediatric patients with drug-resistant\nFrontiers in Immunology 11\nepilepsy. There is some evidence that VNS, when performed for epilepsy, may improve behavior in ASD individuals (39). An observational study revealed that VNS not only controlled epilepsy but also improved the autistic behaviors, especially in language, social and self-help (40). It appears that this behavioral improvement occurs independently of VNS\u2019 modulation of seizure (39). Our findings suggest that SHANK3 in vagal sensory neurons may regulate vagal\nA B\nD E\nC\nFIGURE 6 SHANK2 and TRPV1 are dispensable in LPS-induced hypothermia and systemic inflammation in C57BL/6 mice.

However, this regulatory function of the vagus nerve is impaired after Shank3 deficiency. This notion is supported by our ECG data demonstrating that auricular VNS reduced heart rate in WT mice but not in Shank3 KO mice. Vagus nerve regulates the hemostasis of various physiological functions in our body, including body temperature and inflammation. VNS and peripheral nerve stimulation (e.g., acupuncture) confer protection against LPSinduced hypothermia, systemic inflammation, and septic death (22, 41, 42).\nUsing sensitive RNAscope ISH, we revealed broad expression of Shank3 mRNA in majority of NG neurons. Importantly, selective knockdown of Shank3 by siRNA and AAV Cre virus, via a perineural delivery approach (29, 30), was sufficient to produce the phenotypes (hypothermia and excessive inflammation) in Shank3 GKO and CKO mice. To our knowledge this is the first report to demonstrate the function of Shank3 in vagal sensory neurons. Single-cell RNAseq showed low level expression of Shank3 in some vagal sensory neurons (43). Earlier study showed that SHANK3 expression in primary sensory neurons regulates thermal pain and heat hyperalgesia (24). As a scaffold protein, SHANK3 interacts with TRPV1 and regulates the surface expression of this heat sensor. Thus, capsaicin-induced cellular responses and pain were largely abolished in mice with Shank3 deficiency (24). NG sensory neurons also express multiple TRP channels, including TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8, and TRPM2 (43). Interestingly, Shank3 deficiency resulted in reduced expression of Trpm2, without changing the expression of Trpv1, Trpv4, Trpm8, and SCN10A (encoding Nav1.8). This raises a possibility of transcriptional regulation of Trpm2 by SHANK3. Interestingly, SHANK3 was found in the nuclei of primary sensory neurons (24). Future studies are needed to investigate how SHANK3 regulates the transcription of Trpm2. TRPM2 is a non-selective cation channel. In hypothalamic neurons, TRPM2 channel is a heat sensor. TRPM2 in hypothalamus can limit fever and drive hypothermia (44). TRPM2 is also expressed abundantly in immune cells and is important in inflammatory processes (45). Especially, TRPM2 acts as an oxidant sensor and oxidant sensing by TRPM2 inhibits neutrophil migration and mitigates inflammation (46). We speculate that TRPM2 in vagal sensory neurons could sense the LPS-induced inflammatory oxidants (e.g., ROS). Thus, activation of TRPM2 by stress and oxidants in NG neurons will result in calcium influx and activation of vagal sensory neurons to mediate the anti-inflammatory actions of the VNS. It is noteworthy that basal body temperature under the nonstressful normal conditions does not require Shank3 and Trmp2 in vagal sensory neurons. However, SHANK3 or/and TRPM2 play an important role in maintaining body temperature, under stressful conditions with temperature perturbations, such as LPS challenge, VNS by auricular application of menthol and capsaicin, cold environment, and PGE2-induced fever.\nOur results also showed that Shank3 deficiency in GKO and CKO mice or Shank3 knockdown in vagal sensory neurons lead to increased mortality in response to systemic LPS challenge (1 mg/kg, i.p.). This low-dose LPS challenge produced very low mortality (10%) in WT mice but resulted in 50% mortality in global and conditional Shank -/- mice. This septic death after Shank3 deficiency may result from a substantial loss of body temperature (hypothermia, <32\u00b0C\nFrontiers in Immunology 12\nbody temperature was closely associated with septic death) and excessive inflammation by cytokine storm. LPS-induced IL-6 upregulation is highly correlated to septic death (28). Among the inflammatory cytokines we measured in this study, only IL-6 is significantly dysregulated after Shank3 and Trpm2 deficiency, in response to LPS challenge. A recent study in 2021 was conducted in 9754 autism pupils in Scotland, which is 1.2% out of 787,666 pupils examined. The authors cautiously concluded that the death rate in the current generation of children and young adults with autism is no higher than for other children, in part due to improved diagnosis and care (47). It is noteworthy that ASD children with SHANK3 mutations exhibit frequent respiratory infections in 57% cases (4). It will be of great interest to study if individuals with SHANK3 mutations have a higher risk of mortality than ASD individuals with other genetic mutations.\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate a novel role of SHANK3 in vagal sensory neurons in maintaining body temperature after stressrelated perturbations. Furthermore, vagal SHANK3 can limit excessive inflammation after LPS challenge, offering new molecular insights into inflammation dysregulation in some ASD individuals. Finally, we provided a novel link between SHANK3 and TRPM2, an oxidant/stress sensor, in vagal sensory neurons. Recent study connected SHANK to TRPV4 in the Nucleus Accumbens, as TRPV4 inhibition could alleviate autistic behaviors in Shank3+/mice (7). It remains to be investigated whether impairment of SHANK3-medated vagal modulation is sufficient to drive behavioral changes in ASD, moreover, whether TRPM2 agonist can improve the ASD symptoms."
