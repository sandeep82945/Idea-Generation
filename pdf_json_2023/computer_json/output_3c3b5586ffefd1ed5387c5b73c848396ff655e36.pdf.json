    "abstractText": "Many theories of scientific and technological progress imagine science as an iterative, developmental process periodically interrupted by innovations which disrupt and restructure the status quo. Due to the immense societal value created by these disruptive scientific and technological innovations, accurately operationalizing this perspective into quantifiable terms represents a key challenge for researchers seeking to understand the history and mechanisms underlying scientific and technological progress. Researchers in this area have recently proposed a number of quantitative measures that seek to quantify the extent to which works in science and technology are disruptive with respect to their scientific context. While these disruption measures show promise in their ability to quantify potentially disruptive works of science and technology, their definitions are bespoke to the science of science and lack a broader theoretical framework, obscuring their interrelationships and limiting their adoption within broader network science paradigms. We propose a mathematical framework for conceptualizing and measuring disruptive scientific contributions within citation networks through the lens of network centrality, and formally relate the CD Index disruption measure and its variants to betweenness centrality. By reinterpreting disruption through the lens of centrality, we unify a number of existing citation-based disruption measures while simultaneously providing natural generalizations which enjoy empirical and computational efficiencies. We validate these theoretical observations by computing a variety of disruption measures on real citation data and find that computing these centrality-based disruption measures over ego networks of increasing radius results in better discernment of future award-winning scientific innovations relative to conventional disruption metrics which rely on local citation context alone. This work extends the theoretical foundations and potential applications of citation disruption measures and clarifies the relationship to other notions of scholarly importance, highlighting fruitful connections between bibliometrics and network science. \u2217We thank the National Science Foundation for financial support of work related to this project (grants 1829168, 1932596, and 1829302). 1 ar X iv :2 30 8. 16 36 3v 1 [ cs .S I] 3 0 A ug 2 02 3",

This evolution is driven by a combination of developmental improvements and disruptive breakthroughs, which shape the trajectory of progress in science and technology. The Kuhnian view of scientific and technological progress imagines science as an iterative process, developing incrementally through time, periodically interrupted by periods of revolution, wherein major paradigm shifts disrupt the accepted principles beheld by the preceding \u201cnormal\u201d regime [Kuhn, 1962]. In a similar vein, the \u201ccreative destruction\u201d theory of economic innovation, popularized by Schumpeter, posits that industrial progress is driven by the incessant destruction of old technologies by the new [Schumpeter, 1942]. From general relativity to penicillin, DNA to the internet, artifacts of this revolutionary potential of science continuously restructure society and our shared understanding of the universe. Due to the immense societal value created by these disruptive scientific and technological innovations, accurately operationalizing this perspective into quantifiable terms represents a key challenge for researchers seeking to understand the history and mechanisms underlying scientific and technological progress [Fortunato et al., 2018].\nRecently, a number of promising network-theoretic measurements of such scientific and technological disruption have emerged towards this goal [Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017, Bornmann et al., 2020b, Leydesdorff et al., 2021]. Buoyed by the advent of massive, electronic bibliometric datasets, these disruption measures operationalize the revolutionary interpretation of scientific progress by evaluating the extent to which particular works of science or technology restructure their local knowledge niche, as defined by their relationship to their neighborhood within a citation network. These disruption measures have shown promise in their ability to pick out scientific and technological works that are interpreted as paradigm-shifting [Bornmann et al., 2020a] while remaining distinct from citation count, a widely-acknowledge\u2013but sometimes flawed [Bornmann and Daniel, 2008]\u2013indicator of innovative value. These disruption measures have received wide adoption within the field of science and innovation studies, and have begun to appear as dependent variables in a number of metascientific analyses measuring the differences in scientific achievement with respect to team size [Wu et al., 2019], the effects of topical disagreements on scientific output [Lin et al., 2022], and the observed slowing pace of scientific disruption altogether [Park et al., 2023].\nDespite this empirical success, these disruption measures are largely lacking in a robust mathematical foundation. Their definitions typically rely on counts of papers within bespoke constructions of network neighborhoods and are heavily dependent on their citation network context. This lack of mathematical formalism hides the relationships among competing measures of citation disruption, limits the wider application of these disruption measures to other non-bibliometric network-theoretic domains, hinders the development of more extensive models of scientific innovation, and obscures their position within the broader network social science paradigm Borgatti et al. [2009].\nIn this work, we bridge this theoretical gap by providing a mathematical framework for the definition of citation disruption via network centrality. Specifically, we re-conceptualize a popular measure of citation disruption, the CD Index [Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017], as a measure of betweenness centrality, a well-studied concept in network science that seeks to measure the \u201cimportance\u201d of nodes within a network as a function of the proportion of shortest paths passing through each node [Anthonisse, 1971, Freeman, 1977]. In addition, we show that this centrality framework for measuring scientific and technological disruption is both flexible enough to express many of the objectives sought by a citation-based disruption measure while also recovering existing disruption measures like citation count and variants of the CD Index [Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017, Leydesdorff et al., 2021, Bu et al., 2021, Leibel and Bornmann, 2023] as special cases. The relationship between citation disruption and other frequently-used measures of scholarly importance becomes clear under this network-theoretic reframing, thereby broadening the relevance of disruption measurement to other network science domains and vice versa.\nIn addition to unifying a number of existing disruption measures, this centrality definition of disruption also points towards natural extensions to existing disruption measures which are better aligned with their theoretical motivations and more robust to the noisiness of real-world citation patterns. We verify the empirical potential of these extensions by observing that they are more discerning of award-winning scientific and technological innovations compared to other disruption measures, like the CD Index, or citation count."

The first type consists of contributions that enhance and refine existing streams of knowledge, thereby consolidating the status quo [Enos, 1958, David, 1990, Rosenberg, 1982]. These developmental improvements build upon established theories and methodologies, refining them for greater accuracy, efficiency, or applicability, thereby making them more valuable [Enos, 1962]. The second type of breakthroughs challenge and disrupt existing knowledge, rendering it obsolete and propelling science and technology in new and unforeseen directions [Tushman and Anderson, 1986]. These breakthroughs have the potential to revolutionize entire fields, opening up new avenues of inquiry and application. By embracing both types of breakthroughs, the scientific and technological community continually pushes the boundaries of what is known and reshapes our understanding of the world, paving the way for transformative advancements and discoveries."

However, large-scale bibliometric data, particularly in the form of published scientific papers and patented technologies, offer a valuable context within which to begin making such quantifications [Price, 1963, Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 2002]. The vast body of scientific literature and patent records provides a wealth of information that enables researchers to analyze and trace the evolution of ideas, concepts, and technologies [Liu et al., 2023, Wang and Barab\u00e1si, 2021]. Papers and patents not only present novel ideas but also make citations to prior works, thereby establishing a conceptual genealogy. Analysis of the evolution of citation networks therefore enables tracing of the influence and impact of specific contributions, discernment of patterns of continuity and transformation, and consequently, one approach for the identification of disruptive breakthroughs. While acknowledging the inherent complexities [Bornmann and Marx, 2015, Tahamtan and Bornmann, 2019, 2018, Bornmann, 2020, Waltman, 2016], leveraging bibliometric data in the study of scientific and technological evolution provides valuable insights into the dynamics of knowledge advancement and facilitates a more nuanced understanding of the disruptive forces driving innovation [Wu et al., 2019, Figueiredo and Andrade, 2019, Andrade et al., 2020, Azoulay et al., 2019, Leahey et al., 2023, Zeng et al., 2021, Chu and Evans, 2021, Wang and Barab\u00e1si, 2021, Wang et al., 2023].\nFigure 1: An example citation network G.\nWe define these citation networks as follows.\nDefinition 1. Given a collection of papers V , a citation network G = (V,E) is a directed, unweighted graph formed by directed edges (u, v) \u2208 E connecting u \u2208 V directed towards v \u2208 V if paper u cites paper v.\nHere we have used \u201cpapers\u201d as shorthand to refer to any attributed scientific or technological work which may be situated within a citation network (academic publications, books, patents, etc.). We will continue to use this nomenclature in the following sections though the results extend to any corpus of work which engages in attribution. Under some minor assumptions, we can view G as acyclic, with the directedness of edges describing an implicit temporal ordering of papers, such that the existence of edge (u, v) implies paper v was published before paper u. It will sometimes be convenient to overload notation and write V (G) or E(G) to refer to the set of nodes or set of edges, respectively, of graph G.\nNote that each paper v induces a (possibly trivial) subgraph of papers Dout(v) composed of edges recording v\u2019s citations to prior work E(Dout(v)) = {(v, u) | u \u2208 V (Dout(v))}. This Dout(v) subgraph represents paper v\u2019s approximation of how the concepts and ideas presented in v relate to or are otherwise inspired by the\ncited collection of prior work V (Dout(v)) \\ {v}. Conversely, v also induces a (possibly trivial) subgraph Din(v) composed of edges E(Din(v)) = {(u, v) | u \u2208 V (Din(v))} which connect each paper citing v to v. The set V (Din(v)) \\ {v} may be interpreted as the collection of papers that were directly impacted by or otherwise derived ideas from paper v specifically."

            "text": "The definition and measurement of disruption within citation networks necessitate an examination of how intellectual contributions alter the value of prior streams of knowledge upon which they build [Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017, Park et al., 2023]. At the core of the notion of disruption lies the transformative effect that contributions have on these streams, simultaneously propelling them in new directions while breaking with the past, resulting in a decrease in the use of preceding works. Conversely, developmental contributions enhance the value and utility of previous work, increasing its usage. Therefore, a quantitative measure of disruption should primarily focus on characterizing whether and how a paper alters the use of its predecessors. Within the context of citation networks, this can be accomplished by evaluating the degree by which future works cite the prior works referenced by a focal paper.\nBeyond this fundamental requirement, we further suggest that such a measure should account for the intricate interconnectedness of scientific and technological knowledge, acknowledging the potential for both direct and indirect influences of a particular work. Specifically, it should be capable of characterizing neighborhoods of influence of varying sizes, capturing the nuanced cascading effects on subsequent scientific and technological development. Further, while theories of scientific and technological change often discuss disruption in categorical or binary terms, it is more appropriate to consider disruptiveness as a measure of degree [Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017]. Some works fully eclipse the prior streams of work upon which they build, while others cast more partial shadows. Therefore, an ideal measure should exhibit a continuous nature, allowing for the quantification of these gradations.\nIn summary, given a citation network G = (V,E), we seek to derive a disruption measure \u2206 : V \u2192 R which captures the extent to which paper v is disruptive with respect to the rest of G. Specifically, we seek a function \u2206, dependent on G, which\n1. respects the temporal ordering of G,\n2. measures the degree by which future works cite the prior works referenced by a focal paper,\n3. is sensitive to direct and indirect influence on future works,\n4. is continuous with respect to the disruptive effects measured.\nWe will refer back to these properties of disruption measures in the next section when we introduce network centrality, observing that many centrality measures happen to satisfy these requirements."

            "text": "While there are no precise boundaries for its definition within network science, we define centrality as a class of functions defined on networks which measure the structural or informational \u201cimportance\u201d of nodes within the network. Network centrality has a storied history within the social sciences, with the earliest application of this concept, closeness centrality, appearing at least as early as 1950 as an inverse measure of average distance to each node in the graph for use in evaluating communication efficiency in problem solving across different social group topologies [Bavelas, 1950]. Since then, the number and variety of centrality measures have grown substantially [Newman, 2018]. This growth is due to the fact that the notion of importance is highly context-dependent: importance in a social network may differ from that of a biophysical network, and different still from that a transportation network.1\nIn this section, we provide an introduction to some well-known centrality measures and observe that all of the desired properties of a disruption measure discussed in Section 2 can be satisfied by both betweenness and Pagerank centrality.\n1See Landherr et al. [2010] for a review of centrality in social networks, Ghasemi et al. [2014] for usage of centrality in biological networks, and and Chapter 7 Newman [2018] for a general introduction to some well-known centrality measures. Bloch et al. [2023] propose taxonomy of centrality measures.\n3.1 Degree Centrality\nFigure 2: The in-degree subgraph Din(v) of a citation network G.\nThe degree centrality of a node measures its number of incident edges. Over directed graphs, degree centrality subdivides into out-degree and in-degree centrality, depending on the orientation of the nodes incident edges. The latter of these centrality measures is relevant for our uses, so we provide a proper definition.\nDefinition 2. Given a directed graph H = (V,E), define the in-neighborhood Din(v) of node v with node set V (Din(v)) = {v} \u222a {u | (u, v) \u2208 E} and edge set E(Din(v)) = {(u, v) | u \u2208 V (Din(v))}. The in-degree centrality Q : V \u2192 Z\u22650 of node v is given by Q(v) = |V (Din(v))| \u2212 1 = din(v).\nEvaluated over a citation network G, in-degree centrality satisfies disruption Properties 1 and 4, as the directedness of G reflects the temporal publication order of papers and din(v) may be arbitrarily large, respectively. However, Q does not satisfy Properties 2 and 3 due to its focus only on the citing works of focal node v."

The betweenness centrality B : V \u2192 R\u22650 of a node v within a graph H = (V,E) is given by\nB(v) = 1\np \u2211 s\u2208V \\{v} \u2211 t\u2208V \\{v} \u03c3(s, t | v) \u03c3(s, t)\nwhere \u03c3(s, t) is the number of shortest paths between nodes s and t in H, \u03c3(s, t | v) is the number of shortest paths originating at node s and terminating at t which pass through v, and p is a normalization constant.\nEvaluated over citation network G, betweenness centrality satisfies all of the disruption Properties listed in Section 2. Because B(v) is a relative count of shortest paths from arbitrary nodes across a temporally-ordered citation network, if v acts as a bottleneck in the citation network, requiring its visitation along a shortest path between future and past works of paper v, its betweeenness centrality will be high. By contrast, if the cited works of v are frequently cited by future works of v, its betweenness will be low, as there are multiple shortest paths from future to past work which route around v.\nUsing each node\u2019s inclusion in shortest paths as the measurement of \u201cimportance\u201d endows the betweenness centrality measure of disruption with particular semantics. This geodesic betweenness condition implies that if any path between nodes s and t is shorter than the shortest path between s and t passing through v, then v does not inherit any \u201cimportance\u201d with respect to those pairs of nodes. One can imagine relaxing these austere flow constraints such that if a the path(s) between s and t through v are \u201cclose\u201d to being important, then v still inherits some centrality from this relationship. Pagerank centrality represents one such relaxation by replacing the shortest path betweenness measure with a visitation probability determined by a random walk."

Pagerank assigns centrality based on the stationary distribution of a random walk on this Markov chain. Dangling nodes in H which have zero out-degree eventually capture all probability mass, and thus trivialize the long-run random walk dynamics. To combat this behavior, we connect these dangling nodes to other non-dangling nodes in the graph according to probability vector \u03b3, resulting in a new stochastic matrix P\u0304.\nDefinition 4. Given directed graph H = (V,E) with stochastic transition matrix P\u0304 determined by personalization vector \u03b3 > 0 and teleportation probability \u03b1, the personalized Pagerank centrality \u03a0 : V \u2192 R\u22650 of node v \u2208 V is given by \u03a0(v) = \u03c0v where \u03c0 is the solution to the eigenvalue problem\n\u03c0\u22a4(\u03b1P\u0304+ (1\u2212 \u03b1)1\u03b3\u22a4) = \u03c0\u22a4. (1)\nWhen \u03b3 = 1|V |\u22121, we recover the original Pagerank algorithm which assigns equal teleportation probability between each pair of nodes in the network.\nEquation 1 solves for the stationary distribution of a random walk on H which teleports to new nodes with probability 1\u2212 \u03b1. Thus, measured over citation network G, we may interpret \u03a0(v) as measuring the likelihood a random walker moving backwards through time along paper citations passes through node v (Properties 1, 4). If paper v is highly-cited or is cited by a number of highly-cited papers, \u03a0(v) will be high because v has many opportunities to be visited along a random walk (Properties 2, 3). Thus, we may interpret \u03a0 as a disruption measure in the sense that papers with high Pagerank will be those which will be most likely traversed when walking the citation network between present and past works. Under this interpretation, we see Pagerank satisfies all four properties of a disruption measure given in Section 2."

This topic context of v is typically proxied by observing the citation patterns of a neighborhood NCD(v) around v within the broader citation graph. The CD Index, then, is a measure over the possible configurations of the citation neighborhood NCD(v), assigning higher values to v which have high \u201cimportance\u201d to the connectivity of NCD(v) and low values to those with relatively low \u201cimportance\u201d within NCD(v).\nA number of distinct disruption measures have been introduced under the \u201cCD Index\u201d moniker [Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017, Bornmann et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2023, Leydesdorff et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2021, Li and Chen, 2022, Deng and Zeng, 2023, Wu and Yan, 2019].

[2020a], respectively.\nThe definition of the CD Index relies on the construction of a bespoke neighborhood subgraph NCD(v) around node v. This neighborhood subgraph forms the basis of the CD Index and is given by the following union of graphs:\nDefinition 5. Given an ambient citation graph G, the CD Index neighborhood NCD(v) of node v is defined by\nNCD(v) = Din(v) \u222a Dout(v) \u222a  \u22c3 u\u2208V (Dout(v)) Din(u)  = Din(v) \u222a Dout(v) \u222a K(v) (2)\nwhere K(v) = \u22c3 u\u2208V (Dout(v)) Din(u)\nis the subgraph composed of the union of in-citations for each node in the out-citation subgraph of v. We can equivalently define Equation 2 in terms of its vertex and edge sets:\nV (NCD(v)) = V (Din(v)) \u222a V (Dout(v)) \u222a V (K(v)) E(NCD(v)) = E(Din(v)) \u222a E(Dout(v)) \u222a E(K(v)).\nRemoving this K(v) term from the graph union, we can define the the \u201cno-k\u201d neighborhood subgraph NCDnk(v) centered at v as the following vertex and edge sets:\nV (NCDnk(v)) = V (Din(v)) \u222a V (Dout(v)) E(NCDnk(v)) = E(Din(v)) \u222a E(Dout(v)) \u222a {(u,w) | u \u2208 V (Din(v)), w \u2208 V (Dout(v))}.\nIn other words, NCDnk(v) is composed of the union of the in- and out-subgraphs induced by v, but also includes the edges between these two subgraphs. The subgraph NCDnk(v) forms the basis for the \u201cno-k\u201d CD Index Dnk formulation given in Bornmann et al. [2020a]. Note that the subgraphs NCD(v) and NCDnk(v) are both similar to the (1-hop) ego subgraph N 1(v) (Figure 5), in that all of these graphs contain the union Din(v)\u222aDout(v). However, NCDnk(v) lacks any edges between nodes within V (Din(v)), in addition to lacking edges between nodes within V (Dout(v)). The subgraph NCD(v) also lacks these edges, and contains additional nodes from K(v).\nWith these neighborhood graph definitions, we can now provide definitions of the CD Index measures D and Dnk. Both of these measures are contingent on a labeling of the nodes in the Din(v) subgraph of NCD(v).\nDefinition 6. Given a CD Index neighborhood subgraph NCD(v) of node v, define the I-type nodes of NCD(v) as the set I(v) = {u \u2208 V (Din(v)) | V (Dout(u)) \u222a {v}}.\nIn other words, the I-type nodes of NCD(v) are those which cite only v within NCD(v).\nDefinition 7. Given a CD Index neighborhood subgraph NCD(v) of node v, define the J-type nodes NCD(v) as the set J(v) = {u \u2208 V (Din(v)) | dout(u) > 1} = {u \u2208 V (Din(v)) \\ I(v) \u222a {v}}\nHere dout(u) = |Dout(u)| \u2212 1 is the out-degree of node u. The papers in J(v) are those which cite both v and at least one of the papers that v cites, forming the complement of I(v) with respect to the set of papers citing v. Note that prior two definitions apply also to NCDnk(v), but the following does not.\nDefinition 8. Given a CD Index neighborhood subgraph NCD(v) of node v, define the K-type nodes of NCD(v) as the set K(v) = {u \u2208 V (K(v)) | u \u0338\u2208 V (Din(v))} = V ( NCD(v) ) \\ (V (Din(v)) \u222a V (Dout(v))).\nThe set K(v) accounts for the papers which cite the papers that v cites, but do not cite v directly. Given the node labelings in Definitions 6, 7, 8, we can now define the CD Index measures D and Dnk as ratios of the magnitudes of these sets.\nDefinition 9. Given a neighborhood graph NCD(v) derived from citation graph G = (V,E) as defined in Definition 5, let nI(v) = |I(v)|, nJ (v) = |J(v)|, and nK(v) = |K(v)| be the sizes of the three node sets defined above. The CD Index D : V \u2192 [\u22121, 1] is given by:\nD(v) = nI(v)\u2212 nJ(v)\nnI(v) + nJ(v) + nK(v) (3)\n= nI(v)\u2212 nJ(v) nV (v)\u2212 1\nwhere nV (v) = |V (NCD(v))| is the number of nodes in the neighborhood graph.\nDefinition 10. Given a neighborhood graph NCD(v) derived from citation graph G as defined in Definition 5, let nI(v) = |I(v)| and nJ(v) = |J(v)| be the sizes of the node sets defined above. The no-k CD Index Dnk : V (G) \u2192 [\u22121, 1] is given by:\nDnk(v) = nI(v)\u2212 nJ(v) nI(v) + nJ(v)\n(4)\n= nI(v)\u2212 nJ(v)\ndin(v)\nwhere din(v) = |Din(v)| \u2212 1 is the in-degree of node v. Intuitively, D measures the propensity of paper v to attract citations to itself, drawing attention away from the work which came before it, relative to the total number of citations received by v and the papers it cites. The no-k CD Index Dnk measures a similar propensity, but focuses only on citations made among nodes that cite or are cited by v. Note that D and Dnk satisfy Properties 1, 4, and 2 but fail to satisfy Property 3 due to the one-hop definition of NCD(v). We will return to this observation in Section 5.\nA paper v\u2217 which maximizes the CD Index such that D(v\u2217) = 1 is one which has no J- or K-type citations: all subsequent works either cite v\u2217 or ignore v\u2217 and its cited work entirely. Such a v\u2217 would be a maximally-disruptive paper according to the CD Index. By contrast, a paper v\u2212 which minimizes the CD Index is one with only J-type citations: all of its subsequent citations cite both itself and at least one of its cited papers. Such a v\u2212 would be a maximally-consolidating paper according to the CD Index. Note that v\u2217 and v\u2212 also maximize and minimize Dnk.\nThe CD Index D(v) is inherently measuring the importance of node v with respect to the citation neighborhood NCD(v) by defining a ratio of node types among the papers citing v. As discussed in Section 3, network centrality also provides a framework for measuring importance of nodes embedded within networks. We will now show that this relationship between the importance measured by the CD Index and the importance measured by betweenness centrality are equivalent up to a translation in their ranges."

            "text": "Recall that we are interested in the importance of nodes over a citation graph G, which introduces a number of structural constraints. In particular, we wish to compute the centrality of a node v with respect to NCD(v), which has a very particular structure and leads to the following proposition:\nProposition 1. Evaluated over the CD Index neighborhood graph NCD(v) as described in Definition 5, the betweenness centrality B(v) of node v may be computed as the (normalized) count of paths passing through v:\nB(v) = 1\np \u2211 s\u2208V \\{v} \u2211 t\u2208V \\{v} \u03c3(s, t | v)\nProof. By definition of NCD(v), there is never more than one shortest path between s and t whenever one exists which passes through v, thereby making the denominator of Definition 3 \u03c3(s, t) = 1 whenever \u03c3(s, t | v) \u0338= 0.\nProposition 1 implies that we must only concern ourselves with counting the paths passing through v in order to calculate betweenness centrality over NCD(v). As an immediate corollary, it is easy to see that the vertex v\u2217, which induces subgraph NCD(v\u2217) maximizing B, also maximizes D: papers citing v\u2217 only cite v\u2217 and not its cited papers.\nThe normalization factor p in the definition of betweenness is typically chosen in such a way as to make B(v) comparable across all possible choices of underlying graph. For example, on an arbitrary directed network with n nodes, choosing p = (n\u2212 1)(n\u2212 2) accounts for all possible choices of directed edges between all pairs of nodes excluding the measured node v. However, many of the possible edges enumerated by this combinatorial choice of p are not realizable within NCD(v), so a tighter normalization constant is available.\nProposition 2. Evaluated over the CD Index neighborhood graph NCD(v) as described in Definition 5, the normalization constants\npnk(v) = din(v)dout(v)\n= dout(v)(nI(v) + nJ(v))\nand\npCD(v) = dout(v) \u00b7 |V (NCD(v)) \\ (V (Din(v)) \u222a V (Dout(v))) | = dout(v)(din(v) + nK(v))\n= dout(v)(nI(v) + nJ(v) + nK(v))\nboth normalize B(v) to the range [0, 1]. We denote the betweenness centrality normalized by pCD by BCD and the beweenness centrality normalized by pnk by Bnk.\nProof. This is a multiplicative normalization, so the lower bound of B is unchanged at 0 when normalizing. Thus, it suffices to show that the v\u2217 which induces the subgraph maximizing BCD is equal to 1 under this normalization scheme. As discussed above, the maximal v\u2217 is that which induces NCD(v\u2217) that has all paths between any possible s and t flowing through v\u2217. Any K-type nodes, by definition, do not pass through v\u2217, so they can be ignored at the maximum value (nK(v\u2217) = 0). This means the optimal normalization constant is pCD(v\u2217) = pnk(v\u2217) = dout(v\u2217)din(v\u2217) independent of the inclusion of K-type terms, and we must only consider the maximal value of NCDnk(v\u2217). The maximum betweenness centrality value is achieved by the neighborhood graph which has all in-nodes to v\u2217 connected only to v\u2217. In such a scenario,\nBCD(v\u2217) = Bnk(v\u2217) = 1\npnk(v\u2217) \u2211 s\u2208V \\{v\u2217} \u2211 t\u2208V \\{v\u2217} \u03c3(s, t | v\u2217)\n= 1\npnk(v\u2217) \u2211 s\u2208V \\{v\u2217} dout(v \u2217)\n= 1\npnk(v\u2217) dout(v\n\u2217)din(v \u2217)\n= 1\nAs shown in Proposition 2, the [0, 1]-normalizing constant for graphs of type NCD(v) (NCDnk(v)) is the denominator of the CD Index (no-k CD Index) scaled by dout(v), and D(v\u2217) = BCD(v\u2217) = 1. This observation motivates us to consider to what extent the CD Index and betweenness centrality are related. Careful observation of Definitions 3 and 9 implies that the CD Index is not simply a scaled version of betweenness centrality, as D is a difference of label counts over the citing nodes, whereas B is a ratio of path counts. We can rewrite BCD to further clarify this observation. Letting pCD(v) = dout(v)(nI(v) + nJ(v) + nK(v)) and T (v) = V (Dout(v)) \\ {v},\nBCD(v) = 1\npCD(v)  \u2211 si\u2208I(v) \u2211 t\u2208T (v) \u03c3(si, t | v) + \u2211 sj\u2208J(v) \u2211 t\u2208T (v) \u03c3(sj , t | v) + \u2211 sk\u2208K(v) \u2211 t\u2208T (v) \u03c3(sk, t | v)  = 1\npCD(v) dout(v)nI(v) + \u2211 sj\u2208J(v) (dout(v)\u2212 dout(sj) + 1)  = 1\npCD(v) dout(v)nI(v) + dout(v)nJ(v) + (nJ(v)\u2212 \u2211 sj\u2208J(v) dout(sj)  = 1\npCD(v) dout(v)(nI(v) + nJ(v)) + nJ(v)\u2212 \u2211 sj\u2208J(v) dout(sj))  = nI(v) + nJ(v)\nnI(v) + nJ(v) + nK(v) +\nnJ(v)\u2212 \u2211\nsj\u2208J(v) dout(sj)\ndout(v)(nI(v) + nJ(v) + nK(v))\n= din(v)\ndin(v) + nK(v) \u2212\n\u2211 sj\u2208J(v) (dout(sj)\u2212 1)\ndout(v)(din(v) + nK(v)) . (5)\nand by extension when nK(v) = 0:\nBnk(v) = 1\u2212\n\u2211 sj\u2208J(v) (dout(sj)\u2212 1)\ndout(v)din(v) (6)\nThus, the betweenness centrality Bnk(v) in NCDnk(v) simplifies over this neighborhood graph to a measurement of the relative number of paths in the graph emanating from J-type nodes and routing around v to its cited papers. When extended to graph types NCD(v) with K-type nodes, the resulting value BCD(v) (Equation 5) becomes the proportion of possible shortest paths that can pass through v minus the number of paths which route around v, normalized by the number of possible paths.\nAlthough they are similar, BCD is not equivalent to D. In fact, BCD(v) and D(v) cannot be forced into equality through mere scaling on NCD(v) alone. This is because BCD(v) is a ratio of the number of paths which emanate from J-type nodes and therefore has range [0, 1], whereas D(v) ignores these paths, accounting instead for only the number of J-type nodes, resulting in a range [\u22121, 1].\nHowever, we can force BCD into equivalence with D if we are allowed an additional constant to align the ranges. To see this, note that setting\u2211\nsj\u2208J(v)\ndout(sj) = (2dout(v) + 1)nJ(v) (7)\nbrings Equation 5 into equivalence with D(v):\nBCD(v) = din(v)\ndin(v) + nK(v) \u2212\n\u2211 sj\u2208J(v) (dout(sj)\u2212 1)\ndout(v)(din(v) + nK(v)\n= din(v) din(v) + nK(v) \u2212 (2dout(v) + 1)nJ(v)\u2212 nJ(v) dout(v)(din(v) + nK(v)\nEquation 7 shows that the CD Index is equivalent to computing the betweenness centrality over a neighborhood graph withing which the average out-degree of J-type nodes is 2dout(v) + 1.\nHowever, no proper digraph with the structural constraints of NCD(v) exists that can satisfy Equation 7 due to the fact that each node that cites v can out-degree at most dout(v) + 1. This structural impossibility comes from the fact that BCD is a ratio of paths, whereas D is a shifted count of vertices. To align these two measures, we can either relax our structural constraints on NCD(v) and view it as a multidigraph which has two edges between each J-type node and each node cited by v, or we can re-shift BCD(v) to align with D(v). To find this additive constant q(v) for the latter case, set\nBCD(v) = D(v) + q(v)\nand solve for q(v):\nq(v) = BCD(v)\u2212D(v)\nq(v) = din(v)\ndin(v) + nK(v) \u2212\n\u2211 sj\u2208J(v) (dout(sj)\u2212 1)\ndout(v)(din(v) + nK(v)) \u2212 nI(v)\u2212 nJ(v) din(v) + nK(v)\nq(v) = 2nJ(v)\ndin(v) + nK(v) \u2212\n\u2211 sj\u2208J(v) (dout(sj)\u2212 1)\ndout(v)(din(v) + nK(v))\nThus, we see that the addition q(v) bringing the CD Index and betweenness into alignment is one which re-aligns their ranges by adding 2nJ (v)/(din(v) + nK(v)) to D(v) then deflates D(v) by the number of paths emanating from J-type nodes which still pass through v. If we take \u2211 sj\u2208J(v)(dout(sj)\u2212 1) = dout(v)nJ (v) to be the maximum possible out-degree supported by our assumptions on the neighborhood graph structure NCD(v), we find\nq(v) = 2nJ(v) din(v) + nK(v) \u2212 dout(v)nJ(v) dout(v)(din(v) + nK(v))\n= nJ(v)\ndin(v) + nK(v) .\nIn other words, computing the CD Index D(v) is equivalent to computing the betweenness centrality BCD(v) on the graph NCD(v) where all J-type papers in NCD(v) cite all of v\u2019s cited nodes minus a constant which aligns their ranges by accounting for the proportion of J-type nodes in the graph. Equivalently, on a neighborhood graph wherein all J-type nodes connect to each of v\u2019s out-neighbors, BCD(v) = nI(v)/(din(v) + nK(v)) which measures the proportion of I-type nodes to total nodes which is equivalent to the DI\u2217 reformulation of the CD Index presented in Leydesdorff et al. [2021] and Chen et al. [2021]."

            "heading": "5 Generalizing Disruption Measures via Centrality",
            "text": "The relationship the CD Index and betweenness centrality leads to a number of exciting implications regarding the measurement of disruption. As noted in Section 4.2, the CD Index fails to satisfy Property 3 due to the fact that it is only defined over NCD(v) which is composed of only the immediate predecessor and successor works of v. This specificity in citation context can lead to issues in accurately measuring disruption. For example, if future works do not directly cite paper v and instead attribute better-known or more refined follow-up works of v, D(v) will be blind to these indirect attributions. Similarly, if multiple papers compose a disruptive stream of work wherein each subsequent paper builds upon and eclipses the last in relevance, the most recent work is likely to garner the lion\u2019s share of disruption as measured by the D(v), even though each earlier work composes a piece of the disruptive whole.\nBecause they may be defined with respect to arbitrarily-sized neighborhood graphs, centrality measures are sensitive to this form of indirect influence and therefore offer a theoretical basis for reasoning about these indirect influences and expanding the notion of disruption to account for such behavior. As detailed in Section 3, betweenness and Pagerank are defined with respect to arbitrary-sized neighborhood subgraphs and therefore satisfy Property 3 by default. The relationship between betweenness and the CD Index derived in the previous section motivates one to consider disruption indices constructed from subgraphs of the focal paper of various size and structure, up to the entire ambient citation network. Although work has begun to emerge towards this end [Yang et al., 2023], the heretofore lack of network-theoretic grounding leads to ambiguity in the implementation and properties of the resulting multi-hop measure. The centrality framework for disruption presented in this work provides a much more direct route for such measurement generalizations.\nThis relationship between centrality measures and disruption also highlights the importance of measurement semantics regarding node importance as measured by centrality. As observed in Section 4.3, the CD Index counts J-type nodes the same, regardless of whether they cite all of the focal paper\u2019s prior work or a single prior work. By contrast, betweenness is sensitive to the number of paths which route from successors to predecessors of the focal paper. Pagerank\u2019s random walk semantics are also sensitive to paths between citing and cited papers, though the randomness softens the sensitivity to the path length of these walks. Such\nmeasurement semantics must be taken into account when choosing a disruption measure, whether it be the CD Index, betweenness, Pagerank, or some other centrality measure extended to the disruption context.\nNote that these centrality definitions of disruption also provide computational benefits when measuring disruption over large citation networks. Betweenness centrality is typically computed by running an all-pairs shortest path algorithm which benefits from the compositionality of geodesic distances when run on the entire graph at once. The dynamic nature of this computation, when computed over the entire network at once, provides significant computational savings as one can avoid computing shortest paths along the same path multiple times for each choice of focal paper. This is in contrast to the CD Index and hop-based disruption measures which must compute disruption measures over each subgraph independently, without borrowing information from past computations within the citation network. The Pagerank algorithm enjoys similar computational benefits to betweenness when computed on the entire citation network at once, and the Eigenvalue problem in Equation 1 can be efficiently computed using a power iteration method which allows for arbitrary precision, although convergence issues may warrant consideration [Langville and Meyer, 2004]. In addition, efficient implementations of these centrality-based algorithms exist across many software packages, and approximation algorithms for betweenness also exist [Brandes, 2008].\nFinally, we note that this idea of using centrality to measure paper importance within citation networks is not new. Many past works have investigated the use of centrality measures\u2013especially Pagerank\u2013in highlighting important papers within scientific corpora [Ma et al., 2008, Maslov and Redner, 2008, Frahm et al., 2014], in addition to measuring the relevance of scientisits within their collaboration networks [Senanayake et al., 2015]. By explicitly tying disruption to centrality in this work, we can both begin interpreting these past results within the context of disruption, and further extend the study of disruption to other areas of network social science through the shared language of centrality."

            "text": "This section provides empirical validation for many of the claims made in the previous sections regarding the relationship between disruption and centrality measures. Using a 2021 snapshot of the American Physical Society (APS) bibliographic database, containing over 630,000 papers published in APS journals between the years 1893 and 2019, we derive citation networks based on the corresponding citation data. For each year t \u2208 [1900, 2010] of the data, we create a citation network Gt+h representing the citation network of all papers published up to and including year t+ h where h is an integer-valued lookahead time horizon. For the experiments below, we take h \u2208 {5, 10, 300} where h = 300 is an \u201call-time\u201d horizon which results in a citation network constructed from all papers in the database.\nbetweenness centrality (Bk), and Pagerank (\u03a0k) of each paper published in year t with respect to Gt+h.

We normalize \u03a0k(v) by dividing each Pagerank value by \u03b1/|V (N k(v))|, the lower bound of scores over the neighborhood graph NK(v).

            "text": "Figure 6 displays the correlation between each disruption measure across 5- and 10-year time horizons and across various k-hop subgraphs. As expected, the correlation between B1 and D is substantial, though their disruption measurements are still distinct due to the difference between NCD and N 1. Plotting |B1 \u2212D | versus D as in Figure 7 provides further empirical evidence for the source of the measurement difference between the CD Index and 1-hop betweenness. Overwhelmingly, the papers with D values near zero are those with divergent B1 values.\nAs noted in Section 4.3, this is expected due to the fact that a single citation to the focal paper\u2019s prior work reduces the value of the CD Index the same as if this paper cited all of the focal paper\u2019s prior work, while the same does not hold for betweenness. This discontinuity of the CD Index near D = 0 has been noted in prior work [Wu and Wu, 2019], and the analyses presented here further enforce the notion that disruption based on path measures may provide a more intuitive measure of disruption than those based on node counts.\nFigure 7: Histogram of the difference between the CD Index and 1-hop betweenness across all papers in APS corpus versus the CD Index. The histogram is thresholded so each bin has at least 10 papers.\n1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 CD\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\n|C D\n- B et\nwe ee\nnn es\ns ( 1-\nho p)\n|\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\n35000\nBesides B1, the correlation between D and all other disruption measures is limited. This suggests that each of these disruption measures captures varying facets of disruption with respect to each paper\u2019s neighborhood network. The betweenness disruption measures Bk diverge from D as their neighborhood hop size k increases. This divergence is expected, as the options for shortest routes between the past and future papers relative to the focal paper increases combinatorially with each additional hop. Intriguingly, the family of betweeenness measures also exhibits relatively low inter-family correlation across values of k except for the pair B5 and B10. This observation reinforces the concept that the geodesic distance underlying betweenness may exhibit discontinuous behavior when confronted with minor modifications to the structural composition of the neighborhood graph.\nBy contrast, \u03a0k yields disruption measures which display substantial inter-family correlation across all values of k, reflecting the intuition that disruption derived from random walks may be more robust to modifications to the structural composition of the neighborhood graph surrounding the focal paper. Figure 6 also indicates that Pagerank is, in general, highly correlated with citation count. This relationship is expected, as a higher proportion of nodes directly citing the focal paper implies a higher likelihood of visiting the focal paper along an arbitrary random walk on N k(v). This relationship is especially relevant when k = 1, as \u03a0k(v) will be primarily driven by the number of papers citing v unless each of these papers cite a significant amount of v\u2019s prior work.\nTaken together, the results of these correlation analyses reinforce the observation from Section 5 that the definition and measurement of node \u201cimportance\u201d over the citation network is integral to the resulting semantics of these disruption measures. The node-type importance of D diverges from the geodesic betweenness measure of importance underlying Bk as k increases. Similarly, the random walk visitation importance underlying \u03a0k results in a disruption measure which is correlated to both Citation Count and B1 when k = 1, but then\ndiverges from the latter measure with increasing k until all hops are taken into account. Although each of these measures appears to highlight a distinct facet of disruption, we will observe in the next section that they do share similarity in their aggregate trends across time."

            "text": "Since its introduction, the CD Index has seen frequent employment as a measure of disruptive outcomes with respect to particular structural variables relevant to the science of science like team size [Wu et al., 2019] or scientific discourse [Lin et al., 2022]. A recent study by Park et al. [2023] featured the CD Index in an evaluation of the slowing pace of scientific and technological innovation. In this work, the authors tracked the yearly average value of the CD Index across time and found a generally decreasing trend in disruptiveness measured within citation networks across the sciences. Figure 8 plots the yearly average disruption across papers and their correlations, smoothed by averaging across a centered 5-year window, evaluated at a 5-year time horizon (h = 5). Similar to the observations in Park et al. [2023], we observe a generally downward trend in disruption through time across all alternative specifications of disruption apart from Citation Count and \u03a01. This latter outlier similarity between 1-hop Pagerank and Citation Count is expected due to their close theoretical relationship stemming from a strong influence of direct citations on these measures. As the neighborhood expands, however, we see the time series of Pagerank quickly begins to mirror that of D and B. As the correlation plot suggests, these alternative disruption specifications are highly similar in terms of their aggregate measurements of disruption through time. The high variance of the average yearly value of betweenness across time is an interesting artifact deserving of further study. We hypothesize that these spikes may correspond to structural shifts in the topology of the citation network which, due to the geodesic distance underlying betweenness, results in large jumps in average betweenness across the network. Such structural changes to the citation network topology may be scientifically meaningful and therefore deserve further study. These results imply that even though the alternative measurements of disruption introduced in this paper may see low correlation to the CD Index at the paper level, these alternative specifications are still influenced by similar global trends in the structure of the citation network which play out through time."

            "text": "Using data compiled from Li et al. [2019], we determined all papers in the APS database which were cited within acceptance lectures for the Nobel prize in physics. We then computed the descending percentile rank of each paper in the database according to a each disruption measure. Based on this percentile ranking, we computed the mean ranking of all Nobel prize-winning papers within the dataset. The mean ranking of Nobel prize-winning papers across each time horizon and across each choice of k (for Bk and \u03a0k) is plotted in Figure 9.\nWe observe that the CD Index generally ranks Nobel prize-winning papers as being only slightly more disruptive than the median paper across 5- and 10-year time horizons with high variance in this ranking, and unsurprisingly, the 1-hop betweenness centrality measure of disruption B1 performs similarly. However, we find that Bk assigns higher rank to prize-winning papers as k increases while the variance of this ranking shrinks. As seen in Table 1, computing betweenness on an arbitrary number of hops provides the highest ranking to Nobel prize-winning papers with the lowest standard deviation, followed by Pagerank and B10 for 5- and 10-year time horizons. However as the number of hops decreases, the average ranking assigned by Bk approaches 50%, whereas the \u03a0k rankings experience less average rank deterioration but with increased spread."

            "text": "We have observed that network centrality satisfies many of the properties desired by a measure of scientific and technological disruption within citation networks. In addition, we have shown that citation count and variants of the CD Index may be explicitly rewritten as measuring degree and betweenness centrality, respectively. By detailing this link between citation disruption and network centrality, and by explicitly consolidating existing disruption measures as specific forms of centrality, we have provided a more general and mathematically rigorous framework for measuring scientific and technological disruption within citation networks.\nWe have provided empirical evidence which reinforces the value of this network centrality view of disruption by observing the disruption assigned to Nobel prize-winning papers under various definitions of disruption and paper contexts. In particular, we find that disruption measurements may benefit from an expanded the context outside of a one-hop neighborhood around the focal paper which provides better accounts for down-stream innovations which may not directly attribute the focal work. We hope this relationship between citation disruption and network centrality will foster a more fruitful exchange of ideas between the field of science and innovation studies and the broader network science community."
