    "abstractText": "As an important ecological security barrier in northern China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (hereinafter referred to as Inner Mongolia) is seriously affected by drought. It is of great significance to characterize the spatial distribution of drought and identify the influencing factors of drought. Due to complex interactions among drought driving factors, it is difficult to quantify the contribution of each driving factor to drought using linear correlation analysis alone. In this study, we used the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) as a quantitative indicator of drought to discuss the spatiotemporal variation of drought during growing seasons in the Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2018. We quantitatively characterized mode, scope, and intensity of changes in SPEI caused by drought-influencing factors such as weather, water, topography, soil, and human activities using the Geodetector and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. We concluded that about 20.3% of the region showed a downward trend in SPEI, with the fastest rate of decline in the central and western Inner Mongolia. Air temperature, precipitation, elevation, and distance to rivers are the main controlling factors in drought change, and the factor interactions showed nonlinear enhancement. The drought driving effect was obvious in Alxa League, Wuhai City, Ulanqab City, and Baotou City. The results will help us to understand the effects of the driving factors on drought and eventually help policymakers with water-resource management.",

            "text": "As one of the most serious meteorological and environmental disasters, drought can severely impact the natural environment, crop production, social economy, and human life, but its impact mode is not easy to be quantified [1]. The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) points out that in the past 30 years, the global average temperature has increased by 1.5 \u25e6C, extreme climate events occur frequently, and the degree of drought will continue to increase in the future. Drought impacts species and structure of vegetation. It is an important factor affecting vegetation growth, vegetation restoration, and soil desertification [2\u20134]. Changes in hydrothermal conditions can lead to biomass loss and ecosystem destruction. Therefore, investigating the spatiotemporal variation of drought during the growing season (from April to September) in Inner Mongolia, identifying causes of drought, and separating and quantifying relative contributions of the controlling factors of drought are of practical significance for drought remediation and ecosystem restoration. Due to uncertainties in starting and ending times, spatial scale, time lag effects, and other factors of drought events, researchers mainly monitor and analyze drought effects through a series of drought indicators [1,5]. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 6007. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14236007 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 6007 2 of 18\nis the most widely used water-balance-based meteorological drought index, which comprehensively considers water supply and demand. However, it has limitations in judging short-term droughts [6]. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculates the probability of precipitation distribution; however, it is difficult to handle the task of meteorological drought monitoring under the context of global change [7]. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) leverages the advantages of PDSI and SPI [8,9]. It not only considers the balance of water and energy, but also reflects the deficit and accumulation process of surface water. Therefore, it is widely used in climate studies [7,10], agriculture [11], hydrology [12,13], and so on. At the same time, SPEI can be calculated at multiple time scales. SPEI-3, used to characterize drought in a seasonal scale, reflects short-term regional meteorological drought. It has a direct correlation with grassland biomass and vegetation growth [14,15], and is an important index of vegetation to study drought in a growing season. The China-Mongolia Arid and Semiarid Area (CMASA) is one of the eight major arid regions in the world, and it is also an inland arid region with the highest latitude. Inner Mongolia is located in the transition region between the arid and semi-arid areas in the east of CMASA. Due to the perennial influence of the westerly wind system, atmospheric circulation, and pressure field of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, temperature rise in the west of Inner Mongolia is significantly higher than that in the inland and surrounding areas of China, and is particularly sensitive to climate change [16,17]. Inner Mongolia is China\u2019s main grassland for pasture and agriculture. It is an important ecological barrier to the North of China. For a long time, Inner Mongolia has suffered from frequent regional and local droughts, which have significantly impacted the local economy. The intensification of desertification caused by droughts has become the primary ecological and environmental concern in Inner Mongolia [18]. There are many research activities on long-term drought monitoring in Inner Mongolia: An et al. [19] analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of droughts in Inner Mongolia in the past 60 years; Pei et al. [20] compared the differences and applicability of SPI and SPEI drought indexes at different time scales; Tong et al. [21] used linear regression and wavelet analysis to identify drought changes and drought patterns; however, few studies have quantitatively explained the causes of the droughts. In the past, drought analysis and regional water resource planning were mainly based on linear correlation between factors [22\u201324]. However, drought is a complex regionalization event. It is generally hard to refine intensity and interaction among various factors in different regions using just the traditional linear regression analysis [25,26]. At the same time, drought is closely related to natural conditions, human activities, and their interactions. However, interactions among these factors have not been well-investigated [27]. Different land cover types, soil conditions, topography, and other factors may cause spatial differentiation of local drought. Geodetector and GWR are statistical models considering spatial nonstationarity and the modeling process is simple but intuitive. A combination of the two can accurately describe the action, path, and intensity of the influencing factors and has a good application prospect [28\u201330]. In this study, the seasonal SPEI-3 index (SPEI for short) was calculated based on the data at the meteorological stations in Inner Mongolia; the spatiotemporal variation trend of SPEI in the growing season from 2000 to 2018 was obtained using univariate linear trend analysis. The main controlling factors of drought change were identified through Geodetector. The GWR model was used to quantitatively evaluate the effect of various driving factors on SPEI change during the growing season, and to explain the interaction between the main controlling factors for spatial heterogeneity."

DEM Data\nDEM (Digital Elevation Model) was the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data with a resolution of 90 m downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) data portal (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). After preprocessing, such as mosaicking and void-filling, the accuracy of the input topographic data had a standard error of 1 m. The DEM data were resampled to 1 km \u00d7 1 km and slope and aspect were then derived from the DEM data.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 6007 4 of 18\n2.2.3. Other Data Sets\nPopulation density data was from the population dataset produced by the Landscan Global team (https://landscan.ornl.gov/), with a spatial resolution of 0.01\u25e6 \u00d7 0.01\u25e6 (about 1 km). The data were produced according to the community standard of global population distribution data constructed from multivariable geographic dasymetric modeling and remote sensing image analysis [32]. Land use conversion type can effectively reflect intensity of human activities [33]. It is also an important surface condition for drought research. The land cover data in 2000 and 2018 were from the Resource and Environment Science Data Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.resdc.cn). The data set was obtained by visual interpretation of Landsat TM/ETM+ images for different periods and was widely used [25]. Land cover was classified into six basic categories: cultivated land, forest, grassland, water area, construction land, and unused land. A land use conversion map from 2000 to 2018 was generated. Soil sediment contents were from the 1:1 million soil type map and the soil profile data was obtained from the second soil survey (http://www.resdc.cn). Soil texture was classified according to the content of sand, silt, and clay. The content of particles in different soils was shown as a percentage. Spatial data of main rivers and county stations were derived from the 1:4 million vector database provided by the National Geographic Center of China (http://ngcc.sbsm.gov.cn). Distance to Rivers (DTR) and Distance to Cities (DTC) were obtained through buffer zone analysis, and the spatial resolution was set to 1 km \u00d7 1 km. The 1:1 million vegetation type data released by the Resource and Environment Science Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.resdc.cn) were used. The vegetation in Inner Mongolia was reclassified into 8 classes: coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, shrub, grassland, meadow, swamp, desert, and cultivated vegetation."

            "text": "2.3.1. Calculation of the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)\nThe difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), PD, is a key parameter for SPEI calculation. PET was calculated using the Thornthwaite method because fewer meteorological elements are required [9], as follows:\nPDi = Pi \u2212 PETi (1)\nPET = 16.0\u00d7 (\n10Ti H\n)A (2)\nA = 6.75\u00d7 10\u22127H3\u22127.71\u00d7 10\u22125H2+1.79\u00d7 10\u22122H+0.492 (3)\nwhere Pi is the monthly precipitation of the i-th month, PETi the monthly evapotranspiration, A a constant, and H the annual heat index. The log-logistic function based on three parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) was used to perform the normal fitting to the time series of PDi and compute the probability distribution function F(x). The log-logistic probability distribution function is given as below:\nF(x) = [1 + ( \u03b1 x\u2212 \u03b3 ) \u03b2 ] \u22121\n(4)\nwhere \u03b1 is the scale parameter, \u03b2 the shape parameter, and \u03b3 the position parameter; all are obtained by the linear-moment method. The probability distribution function was standardized to obtain the cumulative probability Q (Equation (5)):\nQ = 1\u2212 F(x) (5)\nand the SPEI value was then calculated as:\nSPEI =  w\u2212 a0+a1w+a2w2 1+d1w+d2w2+d3w3 , w = \u221a \u22122 ln(Q)(Q \u2264 0.5)\n\u2212(w\u2212 a0+a1w+a2w 2\n1+d1w+d2w2+d3w3 ), w =\n\u221a \u22122 ln(1\u2212Q)(Q \u2265 0.5)\n(6)\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 6007 5 of 18\nwhere the constants a0 = 2.515517, a1 = 0.802853, a2 = 0.010328, d1 = 1.432788, d2 = 0.189269, and d3 = 0.001308. The degree of drought (Table 1) was classified according to the local climate conditions [21,34].\n2.3.2. Trend Analysis\nThe univariate linear regression equation (Equation (7)) was used for trend analysis to calculate the variation trend of SPEI during the growing seasons from 2000 to 2018:\n\u03b8slope =\nn\u00d7 n \u2211\ni=1 (i\u00d7 SPEIi)\u2212\nn \u2211\ni=1 i\nn \u2211\ni=1 SPEIi\nn\u00d7 n \u2211\ni=1 i2 \u2212 (\nn \u2211\ni=2 i)\n2 (7)\nwhere n (n = 19) is the length of time series and \u03b8slope is the slope in the linear regression equation. \u03b8slope > 0 indicates that the drought trend is reduced; otherwise, the drought is aggravated. The variation trend of SPEI was divided into five levels based on the standard deviation (STD), i.e., significant degradation (\u03b8slope < \u2212STD), slight degradation (\u2212STD < \u03b8slope < \u22120.5STD), substantially unchanged (\u22120.5STD < \u03b8slope < 0.5STD), slight improvement (0.5STD < \u03b8slope < STD), and significant improvement (\u03b8slope > STD).\n2.3.3. Geodetector\nGeodetector is a spatial statistical model based on spatial autocorrelation theory to reveal the spatial differentiation of geographic elements and their driving factors [30]. We mainly used the factor detector, ecological detector, and interactive detector within the model. The factor detector quantifies the contribution of influencing factors to dependent variables, and it is calculated as follows:\nq= 1\u2212 SSW SST\n(8)\nSSW = l\n\u2211 h=1\nNh\u03c3h2, SST = N\u03c32 (9)\nwhere SSW is the sum of factor variances over all layers and SST is the total sum of variance, where h = 1, . . . l is the number of strata of the dependent variable or independent variable; Nh and N are the number of units in class h and the whole region, respectively; and \u03c3h2 and \u03c32 are the variances of the dependent variable for the units in class h and the whole region, respectively. The larger the q-value is, the stronger the explanatory power of the factor to the drought phenomenon. The effective range of q is [0, 1]. The ecological detector uses an F test to measure the significant difference of the impact of different influencing factors on the spatial distribution of drought. The F value is determined as follows:\nF = Nn=1(Nn=2 \u2212 1)\u03c32n\u22121 Nn=2(Nn=1 \u2212 1)\u03c32n\u22122\n(10)\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 6007 6 of 18\nwhere Nn=1 and Nn=2 refer to the sample size of two random factors, and F reflects the significance level. The interaction detector was used to identify whether two driving factors, x1 and x2, increase or decrease the explanatory power of the drought index SPEI when they work together (Table 2).\nIn addition to the influences of meteorological variables, droughts are also affected by other factors including geographic location, topography, soil, land cover type, human activities, etc. Land cover type affects runoff, infiltration, and evapotranspiration of surface water through water absorption [35]. We selected 12 potential drought driving factors as follows: Mean Air Temperature (MAT), Mean Precipitation (MP), Mean Wind Speed (MWS), and Mean Sunshine Duration (MSD) during the growing season, representing the meteorological conditions; Percent of Sand (POS) in soil, representing soil texture; elevation, slope, and slope aspect, representing topographic conditions; Distance to rivers (DTR), representing potential water availability; Distance to Prefecture Cities (DTC), Land-Use and Land-Cover Change (LUCC), and Average of population Density (AOPD), representing human factors that can transform and regulate the local environment [36]. These factors are easy to be quantified [25,37,38]. Since Geodetector can only handle discrete variables, the 12 variables need to be discretized individually. The LUCC factors were divided into 36 grades according to the land use type conversion maps from 2000 to 2018, the slope and aspect were divided into 9 grades, and each of the other 10 factors was divided into 6 grades by the Jenks Natural Breaks Classification Method (Figure 2).\n2.3.4. The GWR Model\nThe GWR model is an extension of the ordinary linear regression analysis method [39], which can effectively estimate the data with spatial autocorrelation and reflect the spatial heterogeneity of parameters in different regions. The multi-variate linear regression equation is given by:\nyi = \u03b20(ui, vi) + n\n\u2211 j=1 \u03b2 j(ui, vi)xij + \u03b5i (11)\nwhere \u03b20 represents the intercept; (ui, vi) represent the coordinates of the i-th sampling point; \u03b2j (ui, vi) the j-th regression parameter on the i-th sampling point, which has geographic significance; xi1, xi2, xi3,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xin are n regression variables at this point; and \u03b5 represents random error. Finally, the revised Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was compared with the ordinary least squares (OLS) results. AIC is defined as:\nAIC = \u22122InL(e\u0302L, y) + 2c (12)\nwhere y represents the sample set of the fitting value of the dependent variable SPEI, L(\u00eaL, y) is the likelihood function, \u00eaL is the maximum likelihood estimate of eL, and c is the number of unknown parameters. The smaller the AIC is, the higher the fitting degree will be.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 6007 7 of 18Remote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 20\nFigure 2.

The increasing trends of SPEI in swamp, coniferous forest, and broad-leaved forest were the most obvious, accounting for more than 85%. These land covers were located in a high-latitude, low-altitude forest area. The area has a large amount of precipitation, abundant water resource, and a low probability of drought. About 93.12% of the area where SPEI dropped significantly was located in the desert, accounting for about 61.53% of the total desert area. In the past 20 years, the mean annual precipitation in the desert areas of Inner Mongolia was less than 150 mm. Under the high-temperature and high-evaporation climatic conditions, water loss became severe and terrestrial carbon productivity was restricted, leading to an increased risk of drought [40].

The elevation factor has the greatest influence on \u03b8slope when the factor level is low (\u22642), while factors MAT and MSD have a larger impact at a high factor level (>4). The elevation increases from the first level (100~500 m) to the fifth level (1500~3500 m), and the \u03b8slope decreases from 0.58\u00b7(10 yr\u22121) to \u22120.02\u00b7(10 yr\u22121).

The relationship between \u03b8slope and any of the following factors, DTC (X6), aspect (X8), AOPD (X10), and POS (X11), does not show a significant linear trend (Figure 5b). When POS is at the second level (38~47%), \u03b8slope reaches a peak value. This may imply that appropriate amount of sand is conducive to the respiration of plant roots, retaining soil moisture, and transportation of nutrients. However, a percentage of sand that is too high can easily cause surface degradation, soil moisture loss, and soil erosion. DTC, aspect, and AOPD have much smaller variation ranges of \u03b8slope, which indicates that these factors have little influence on the change of SPEI rate. SPEI over most land cover types (X12) increased from 2000 to 2018, and SPEI decreased over only two land covers, in which cases water area was converted to construction area and unused land (Figure 5d). The \u03b8slope of the two land covers was \u22120.09\u00b7(10 yr\u22121) and \u22120.03\u00b7(10 yr\u22121), accounting for 0.1% and 11.5% of the study area, respectively. Among all land conversion types, the SPEI of unaltered forest land increased at the fastest rate 0.51\u00b7(10 yr\u22121). Overall, the factors with strong explanatory power in the factor detector have a larger fluctuation range of \u03b8slope. The \u03b8slope values of factors such as MP, elevation, MAT, and DTR are in four ranges of \u22120.07~0.55, \u22120.02~0.58, \u22120.04~0.53, and \u22120.09~0.44\u00b7(10 yr\u22121), respectively. The change range of SPEI rate influenced by natural factors, such as meteorology and topography in the study area, was larger than that influenced by human factors. The ranking of the influence by interacting pair of factors was given in Table 5. Only the precipitation \u2229 DTC (X2 \u2229 X7) and wind speed \u2229 elevation (X1 \u2229 X2) pairs of the first 15 interacting pairs showed nonlinear enhancement; the others were dual-factor enhancement. Among them, the influence by the interaction between precipitation and elevation is the strongest, with a q-value of 0.870, followed by that between temperature and precipitation; the interaction between wind speed and elevation has the lowest explanatory power, with a q-value of 0.686. As expected, precipitation is an important source of water and a crucial driving factor in the process of drought changes. The difference in precipitation between the east and west of Inner Mongolia contributes mainly to the spatial\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 6007 11 of 18\ndifferentiation of drought condition. Elevation also has a strong explanatory power for drought.

The relationship between \u03b8slope and any of the following factors, DTC (X6), aspect (X8), AOPD (X10), and POS (X11), does not show a significant linear trend (Figure 5b). When POS is at the second level (38~47%), \u03b8slope reaches a peak value. This may imply that appropriate amount of sand is conducive to the respiration of plant roots, retaining soil moisture, and transportation of nutrients. However, a percentage of sand that is too high can easily cause surface degradation, soil moisture loss, and soil erosion. DTC, aspect, and AOPD have much smaller variation ranges of \u03b8slope, which indicates that these factors have little influence on the change of SPEI rate. SPEI over most land cover types (X12) increased from 2000 to 2018, and SPEI decreased over only two land covers, in which cases water area was converted to construction area and unused land (Figure 5d). The \u03b8slope of the two land covers was \u22120.09\u00b7(10 yr\u22121) and \u22120.03\u00b7(10 yr\u22121), accounting for 0.1% and 11.5% of the study area, respectively. Among all land conversion types, the SPEI of unaltered forest land increased at the fastest rate 0.51\u00b7(10 yr\u22121). Overall, the factors with strong explanatory power in the factor detector have a larger fluctuation range of \u03b8slope. The \u03b8slope values of factors such as MP, elevation, MAT, and DTR are in four ranges of \u22120.07~0.55, \u22120.02~0.58, \u22120.04~0.53, and \u22120.09~0.44\u00b7(10 yr\u22121), respectively. The change range of SPEI rate influenced by natural factors, such as meteorology and topography in the study area, was larger than that influenced by human factors.\nFigure 5.

A negative coefficient in an area and the absolute value of the coefficient indicate that the area is drought-stricken and the strength of the driving effect, respectively.

The overall fluctuation ranges of the two are relatively large, and the regression coefficient intervals are (\u22121.20, 0.60) and (\u22121.4, 0.55), respectively. The area in drought driven by temperature accounted for about 70.2%, of which the areas with strong temperature driving (\u22120.6~\u22121.20) were mainly located in Alxa Left Banner of Alxa League, Wuhai City, Hanggin Banner and Otog Banner of Ordos City, Urad Rear Banner of Bayannur City, and parts of Xilingol League (Figure 6a). Due to the large temperature difference between the east and west of the study area (up to 12.7 \u25e6C), the surface vegetation in the western hot area had strong transpiration and respiration, and the dry matter consumption and soil water loss were larger, which further expanded the arid area [41,42]. The difference of the driving results between precipitation and temperature factors is mainly in the semi-arid grasslands (Figure 6b), such as Xilinhot City, West Ujimqin Banner and East Ujimqin Banner in Xilingol League. The average precipitation in the growing season in this region was greater than 150 mm, which was enough for the growth of vegetation such as grassland, shrubs, and other vegetation [43].

            "text": "Drought is mainly caused by the imbalance of regional precipitation and evapotranspiration. We found that the change rate of SPEI during the growing season in Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2018 ranged from \u22120.4 to 0.75\u00b7(10 yr\u22121), and the area with decreasing SPEI accounted for 20.3% of the total area. The areas where the SPEI increased significantly (\u03b8slope is between 0.25 and 0.75\u00b7(10 yr\u22121)) are mainly located in Hulunbuir City, Hinggan League, and Tongliao City. The distribution characteristics of SPEI shown in this study are similar to the results of previous drought monitoring based on long-term series [19,20]. The differences are mainly manifested in the areas such as Hinggan League and Tongliao City, where drought changes increased significantly. Around 2000, the SPEI time series of the Mongolian Plateau showed a significant turning point from increasing to decreasing [34,44]. The results of the Geodetector modeling showed that the SPEI change was driven by four main controlling factors: air temperature, precipitation, DTR, and elevation (Table 4) during the growing season in the study area. Precipitation is a direct factor in drought (q = 0.73). Relevant studies have shown that in arid and semi-arid areas, vegetation growth and ecosystem health status depend directly on atmospheric precipitation [45]. The interaction detection results show that the joint effect of precipitation and elevation has the most explanatory power (q = 0.87). Conclusions about attribution analysis of drought agreed with a previous study [36]. However, we considered the special climatic background of Inner Mongolia in this study of meteorological drought. The impact of elevation reflects the influence of topography on mass and energy transportation and distribution of temperature and water availability that affect regional ecosystems through altering vegetation species and distribution and the formation and evolution of regional climate [46]. According to the drought trend (Figure 4a) and the spatial distribution of the regression coefficient of SPEI with GWR model factors (Figure 6), it was found that significantly reduced SPEI at a rate of \u22120.40~\u22120.25\u00b7(10 yr\u22121) occurred in Alxa Left Banner in Alxa League, Dorbod Banner chain Ulanqab City, Darhan Muminggan United Banner in Baotou City, and Wuhai City in the western part of the study area. The drought in Alxa League and Wuhai City was caused by a synergy of hot air temperature, lack of precipitation, high elevation, and high DTR, while the drought in Ulanqab City and Baotou City was mainly caused by hot air temperature, lack of precipitation, and high elevation."

The central and western part of the study area is dominated by plateaus and mountains. Due to the barrier and uplifting effects of the Great Khingan Range-Yin Mountains-Helan Mountains on water vapor, the eastern and southern piedmont of the mountains are the East Asian monsoon zone (elevation is about 150~500 m) and the west piedmont of the mountains is the non-monsoon zone (the elevation is generally higher than 1000 m). As an important terrain factor, elevation has a significant impact on the spatial correlation of factors. We found an interesting pattern to speculate the relative importance of environmental and anthropogenic factors in our study area by elevation gradients. As the statistical results of q-values of various factors in different elevation intervals (Figure 7a), in the 100\u2013500 m elevation interval, the average precipitation (X1) in the growing season is 261.5 mm, and the q-value is the smallest. When the precipitation reaches a certain level, the impact of precipitation on SPEI decreases [48]. For the forest area, the ecological water storage is sufficient and the correlation between SPEI and sunshine duration (X4) is stronger. In the elevation range of 800~1000 m, the q-values of factors such as air temperature (X1), precipitation (X2), sunshine duration (X4), slope (X9), POS (X11), and LUCC (X12) increased significantly, indicating that the change in SPEI was mainly affected by natural factors and some human activities. When the elevation increases to 1000~1300 m, the q-values of POS (X11) and LUCC (X12) reach the maximum of 0.38 and 0.42, respectively, and the q-values of other factors show a downward trend. In the area above 1300 m in elevation, the explanatory power of all factors decreases significantly with increasing elevation. Remote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 20 increased significantly, indicating that the change in SPEI was mainly affected by natural factors and some human activities.

In the area above 1300 m in elevation, the explanatory power of all factors decreases significantly with increasing elevation.\nFigure 7. The change in q statistics of influencing factors on SPEI along the gradient of Elevation (a) and R2 statistics of prefecture cities (b).\nIt is worth mentioning that the conversion of land use types is an important influencing factor reflecting human activities, as well as an important explanatory factor for drought changes (Table 3). Between 2000 and 2018, in the 800~1300 m elevation interval, SPEI was significantly enhanced by the land use conversion. According to statistics, the land use types that account for the largest area in this elevation interval are unaltered woodland and unaltered grassland (Table 6), which account for 48.3% and 15.5% of the total area of the region, respectively. The growth rates of SPEI are 0.52\u00b7(10 yr\u22121) and 0.018\u00b7(10 yr\u22121), respectively, indicating that the series of ecological restoration projects such as \u201cclosing hills for afforestation and reforestation, retiring grazing and raising grass\u201d implemented by the Chinese government in Inner Mongolia since 2000 have played an important role [49]. In addition, in the conversion of land use from unused land to grassland and from farmland to grassland, SPEI increased by 0.24 and 0.58, respectively, which alleviated the drought conditions in the area to a large extent (Figure 5d). The SPEI of the unchanged farmland increased by 0.57, and the SPEI growth rate was 0.019\u00b7(10 yr\u22121). This may be related to improvement in irrigation. Modern irrigation technology has improved the utilization rate of water resources and increased the field water holding capacity [50]. At the same time, grassland degradation caused by overgrazing and long-term abandonment of land aggravated the degree of drought [51,52]. For example, the grassland in the 800~1300 m elevation range was converted to unused land; as a result, the SPEI decreased by 0.42, while the SPEI of unaltered unused land decreased by 0.21.\nFigure 7.

We made the following conclusions. (1) The SPEI in the growing season from 2000 to 2018 in Inner Mongolia showed a spatial variation pattern from dry west to wet east. The area with light drought accounts for the largest proportion in the whole region. (2) The inter-annual variation of SPEI shows an upward trend and the area of elevated SPEI accounted for 79.70% of the study area. These results indicate that the drought condition became alleviated with time during the growing season in Inner Mongolia. (3) The drought changes in Inner Mongolia were generally controlled by natural factors, with nonlinear interaction between factors enhancing drought impact. The aggravated drought in the central and western regions of the study area, such as Alxa League, Ulanqab City, Baotou City, and Wuhai City, were mainly driven by a synergy of hot air temperature, scarce precipitation, and high elevation, with significant impact from soil and LUCC at an elevation of 800~1300 m.
