    "abstractText": "A 65-year-old female presented with pain and swelling in the small joints of both hands for 5 years duration. It was associated with an early morning stiffness of 20 min. She denied any history of skin rash or any inflammatory low back pain in the past. Examination revealed tenderness and hard nodular swellings around multiple distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of both hands known as Heberden\u2019s nodes; and deformity involving right little finger (Figure 1A). Investigations revealed elevated acute phase reactants (ESR\u201442 mm/h and CRP\u201424 mg/l). Rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide were negative. Her plain radiograph of both hands showed, central erosions in multiple DIP joints with sclerosis and osteophyte formation resembling the shape of a sea gull (\u2018gull-wing\u2019 appearance), joint space narrowing, \u2018Saw-tooth\u2019 pattern of erosion with subchondral cysts and complete joint ankylosis (Figure 1B). She was diagnosed as a case of erosive hand osteoarthritis (EHOA), and started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy. Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is divided into three different phenotypes depending on the joints in the hands that are affected; these phenotypes consist of EHOA, non-EHOA (nodal OA) and first carpometacarpal joint OA. EHOA is an aggressive form of hand OA which predominantly affects post-menopausal woman. It is characterized by a severe inflammatory clinical phenotype associated with distinctive radiographic features as described above. Currently, no specific treatments are available to slow the disease progression.",
