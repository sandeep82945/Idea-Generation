In particular, abnormal SN-initiated network switching impacts the engagement and disengagement of the CEN and DMN, and is proposed to lead to the generation of psychosis symptoms. Between-network connectivity has been shown to be abnormal in both substance use disorders (SUD) and psychosis. However, none have studied how SUD affects connectivity between sub-networks of the DMN, SN, and CEN in early stage psychosis (ESP) patients. In this study, we collected data from 113 ESP patients and 50 healthy controls to investigate the effect of SUD on between-network connectivity. In addition, we performed sub-group analysis by exploring whether past SUD vs current SUD co-morbidity, or diagnosis (affective vs non-affective psychosis) had a modulatory effect. Connectivity between four network-pairs, consisting of sub-networks of the SN, CEN, and DMN, was significantly different between ESP patients and controls. Two patterns of connectivity were observed when patients were divided into sub-groups with current vs past SUD. In particular, connectivity between right CEN and the cingulo-opercular salience sub-network (rCEN-CON) showed a gradient effect where the severity of abnormalities increased from no history of SUD to past+ to current+. We also observed diagnosis-specific effects, suggesting non-affective psychosis patients were particularly vulnerable to effects of substance use on rCEN-CON connectivity. Our findings reveal insights into how comorbid SUD affects betweennetwork connectivity and symptom severity in ESP.\nKey words: substance use disorder/psychosis/functional connectivity/resting state networks/between-network connectivity/Triple Network Model"

Menon et\u00a0al. (2011) proposed a Triple Network Model of psychopathology which highlights abnormal organization, functioning of, and interactions between the Salience Network (SN), Default Mode Network (DMN), and Central Executive Network (CEN) as a framework for understanding the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.5 In this model, the SN is suggested to play a key role in initiating network switching, thus resulting in the engagement/disengagement of attention to external events (CEN) and internal events (DMN). This model highlights the importance of studying between-network connectivity, as dysfunction in one of the three networks is likely to result in abnormalities in the other two. In psychosis, structural and functional abnormalities have been observed in all 3 networks. Supekar et\u00a0al. computed a network interaction index (NII), posited to capture the extent to which the SN is engaged with the CEN and decoupled from the DMN, and showed that it was significantly lower in schizophrenia patients.

The DMN is thought to comprise of at least 3 functionally-distinct components, including a dorsal medial pre-frontal subnetwork (linked to mentalizing) and a mesial temporal lobe sub-network (linked to cognitive functions and episodic memory).7\u20139 The SN has also been associated with 2 distinct sub-networks that reflect a dorsal-ventral organization of salience network to synchronize with externally and internally-oriented networks, respectively.10,11 The cingulo-opercular salience network (CON) is a transitional ventral-insula network linking cognition with emotion and interoception12 that is also involved in functions such as tonic alertness and the maintenance of task mode, while the prefrontal-dorsal insula salience network (Sal) is linked to orchestrating task-switching.13\u201316 Finally, the CEN is thought to show hemisphere lateralization,12,17 with both left and right lateralized CEN being associated with cognitive processing. However the left CEN is more strongly associated with language functions and the right CEN is more strongly associated with reasoning, attention, inhibition, and memory.12\nSubstance use, particularly during adolescence or early adulthood, is associated with a consistent increase in the risk of developing psychosis.18\u201320 A\u00a0growing body of evidence has shown associations between substance use disorder (SUD) and psychotic disorders \u2013 substance use co-occurs at a far higher rate in psychosis patients compared to the general population,21 patients with SUD have greater impairments (eg lower functioning) and poorer outcomes (eg higher unemployment) than patients without.22,23 In addition, the effects of SUD co-morbidity appear to be diagnosis-dependent, where clinical outcomes were observed to be worse in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia compared to patients diagnosed with affective psychosis.24 Importantly, SUD has also been shown to affect between-network connectivity in similar regions to psychosis, particularly between the SN-CEN.25 Altogether, these findings suggest that substance use may mediate the relationship between psychosis symptom severity and between-network connectivity.\nThe early stage of psychosis (ESP) \u2013 the initial years following the first episode of psychosis (FEP) \u2013 is considered a critical period during which effective intervention may help slow functional decline and promote favorable outcomes.26\u201328. However, the key influencing factors and alterations in the brain that render sub-groups of patients vulnerable to symptom exacerbation and poor recovery are\nnot well understood. Also, the actual impact of SUD on brain connectivity in ESP patients is not well studied. While lifetime prevalence of SUD is high in psychosis patients, studies have also reported that patients significantly reduce substance use after FEP.29 To date, few studies differentiate between past and current SUD. Thus, the persistence of connectivity abnormalities resulting from SUD is unclear.\nStudies have examined substance use prevalence and between-network connectivity in psychosis patients independently, but to our knowledge none have looked at them together, especially during the critical ESP period. Furthermore, previous research has mostly focused on the DMN, SN, and CEN as a whole and not studied betweennetwork connectivity in the Triple Network framework at the finer granularity of sub-networks. Also, given that SUD and psychosis appear to affect similar resting state networks (RSNs), understanding (1) whether SUD results in independent or additive/gradient effects, (2) whether SUD effects on between-network connectivity are persistent, and (3) the impact of diagnosis, would have significant potential to guide better treatment. In this study, we collected neuroimaging and clinical data from a cohort of transdiagnostic ESP patients and healthy controls to investigate the effect of SUD and diagnosis specificity on between-network connectivity in ESP patients. We first assessed differences between ESP patients and controls in connectivity between sub-networks of the SN, DMN, and CEN. We then examined whether histories of past or current SUD co-morbidity were associated with differences in between-network connectivity in ESP patients. We also investigated whether observed differences in betweennetwork connectivity were affected by diagnosis. Finally, we explored whether SUD mediated the connectivity between networks and symptom severity. We hypothesized that between-network connectivity of sub-networks in the Triple Network Model would be abnormal in ESP patients; patients with co-morbid SUD would show a greater dysregulation of between-network connectivity than those without; and that patients with non-affective psychosis and SUD co-morbidity would show greater impairments than those with affective psychosis and SUD co-morbidity, particularly between sub-networks of the SN and CEN."

To ensure rigorous denoising of subject movements, ICA-AROMA components were visually assessed, and erroneous labels were manually edited. fMRI data were non-aggressively denoised to remove artifacts. Additionally, noise regressors were generated to implement aggressive denoising (fsl_regfilt) in runs that exceeded motion exclusion criteria (Maximum framewise displacement [FD] exceeding 3\u00a0mm; or 80th percentile FD of all volumes in a scan exceeding 0.3mm37).

Significance level was P < .05 after correction with FDR (Benjamini\u2013 Hochberg method) across the four network-pairs.\nPatients Split Into Sub-Groups Given the small sample size in each patient sub-group, multiple comparison\ncorrections were applied for pairwise sub-group comparisons (specified below) for each network-pair, but not across the different network-pairs to retain sensitivity. Significance level was set at P < .05 for all analyses (after corrections where relevant). Therefore, for analyses involving sub-groups, each network-pair was regarded separately with independent hypotheses (following analyses repeated across all 4 network-pairs).\nEffect of SUD - Two separate LM models were ran with between-network connectivity as the dependent variable in patients alone, and (1) history vs no history of SUD, or (2) past vs current SUD as the independent variables.\nFig. 1.

First, between-network connectivity in patients diagnosed with affective (AP) vs non-affective psychosis (NAP) were compared with controls where Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison correction was applied for 2 sub-group comparisons (eg AP vs controls and NAP vs controls). Second, for the network-pair that showed a significant current SUD effect (rCEN-CON), a LM was ran in patients alone with between-network connectivity as the dependent variable, and the interaction between diagnosis (AP/NAP) and current SUD (with/without) as the independent variable. The difference in connectivity in NAP patients with and without current SUD, and AP patients with and without current SUD was assessed."

Therefore, it appears that the abnormalities in between-network connectivity in the Triple Network framework are specific to distinct sub-networks in the SN and DMN that are closely linked to CEN functions. Our results also suggest lateralization of CEN functions, as we only observed abnormalities for network-pairs involving the right CEN. The right CEN has been linked to multiple cognitive processes including reasoning, attention, inhibition, and memory; whereas the left CEN has been strongly mapped to language processing, including semantic, phonologic, and orthographic tasks.12,17"

This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that SUD affects CEN-SN connectivity. The addiction literature hypothesizes an inappropriate shift of salience attributed to substance-related cues, with decreased sensitivity to non-substance reinforcers.51,52 Reduced CEN-SN connectivity has also been associated with impairments in cognitive control and higher impulsivity.25,53,54 Thus, altered rCEN-CON FC could be a mechanism underlying an overlapping feature in both SUD and psychosis.\nIn addition, our study provides some evidence that past SUD has persistent effects on brain connectivity.

Literature indicates that AP patients have higher cognitive reserve and better premorbid IQ than NAP patients,56,57] suggesting that cognitive reserve, premorbid IQ, and functioning (proxy for greater brain weight and increased efficiency of connectivity) might play a role in mediating higher vulnerability in NAP patients. AP patients in our sample had higher education and lower PANSS negative score (associated with cognitive performance), which indirectly supports greater cognitive reserve and differential vulnerability.

Reports, where patients described using substances to alleviate positive symptoms, and relieve non-psychotic effects such as general dysphoria and anxiety, support the self-medication hypothesis.62, 63 Nevertheless, the temporal relationship between SUD and psychosis is difficult to determine due to the difficulties in establishing when illness begins. In our study, the age of onset of substance use is lower than the age of onset of psychosis. Model 3 (SUD as mediator) only performed slightly better than model 2 (positive symptoms as mediator).

The categorical effects of SCIDderived SUD may be different than the dimensional effects using different drug assessments. Furthermore, we did not collect detailed information on remission for patients with past SUD. Information on past or current nicotine use disorder was also not available. However, few patients and none of the controls were smokers in our study. Finally, motion effects remain a potential confounder in neuroimaging studies. While we have corrected for motion in our processing pipeline, we also included a motion parameter as a co-variate in our models, and main findings were unchanged (supplementary material S10).
