    "abstractText": "Methods: Specific pathogen-free C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with stools from ET patients or matched healthy individuals. After 3 weeks of gavaging, behavioral tests were performed on all mice. Next, each mouse was injected with harmaline to induce tremors. The tremor duration was recorded; the tremor score was estimated every 30 min. Behavioral tests were repeated after modeling. Intestinal tissues and fecal samples of the mice were examined using histology and 16Sr DNA sequencing, respectively.",

We\u00a0 explored the effects of gut microbiota on ET in mice.\nMethods: Specific pathogen-free C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with stools from ET patients or matched healthy individuals. After 3 weeks of gavaging, behavioral tests were performed on all mice. Next, each mouse was injected with harmaline to induce tremors. The tremor duration was recorded; the tremor score was estimated every 30 min. Behavioral tests were repeated after modeling. Intestinal tissues and fecal samples of the mice were examined using histology and 16Sr DNA sequencing, respectively.\nResults: Compared with mice receiving microbiota from healthy controls, mice receiving fecal suspensions from ET patients showed worse performance in the pre-modeling behavioral tests. After modeling, ET-group mice showed significantly greater tremor scores, longer tremor duration, and worse motor performance. They also had significantly lower body weight and lower fecal pellet count. Pathological scoring revealed more severe intestinal lesions in ETgroup mice. The 16S rDNA sequencing data revealed significant differences in microbiota indices, and a correlation between these indices and tremors in mice. Functional predictions indicated that the abundance of GABA-related enzymes was altered in ET-group mice.\nConclusion: Mice transplanted with gut microbiota from ET patients showed worse performance in behavioral tests. After modeling, ET-group mice presented longer tremor duration, higher tremor score, and worse motor performance. This study provides evidence for gut microbiota dysbiosis that may affect the pathogenesis of ET.\nKEYWORDS\ngut microbiota, washed microbiota transplantation, microbiome-gut-brain axis, tremor, essential tremor"

            "text": "Essential tremor (ET) is a common neurological disease characterized by bilateral action tremors of the upper limbs (Haubenberger and Hallett, 2018). The estimated prevalence of ET among people aged 65 years or older is 4.6% (Louis and Ferreira, 2010). Although the mechanism underlying ET is still debated, several evidence-based hypotheses point to different pathological causes. The \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) hypothesis suggests that ET may associate with low levels of GABA (M\u00e1lly and Baranyi, 1994) and its receptors in the cerebellum (Paris-Robidas et\u00a0al., 2012). At present, \u03b2-blockers, propranolol, and primidone are used as first-line drugs for the treatment of ET (Zesiewicz et\u00a0al., 2011; Zappia et\u00a0al., 2013), though these treatments are not ideal. The treatment of ET is limited by a lack understanding of the disease mechanism, and new avenues of research are required to develop effective therapeutic strategies for ET.\nThe influence of the gut microbiota on human physiology and pathology is gradually being revealed in multiple organ systems. Gut dysbiosis has been related to gastroenterological diseases like Clostridium difficile infection, Crohn\u2019s disease, and constipation (Ooijevaar et\u00a0al., 2019), for which treatments such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation have been proved effective. The role of the gut-brain axis has also been widely discussed in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. The association between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system is bi-directional, as proven by a variety of evidence. Studies have found that the gut microbiota of patients with different central nervous system diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder (Palkova et\u00a0al., 2021), Parkinson\u2019s disease (Li et\u00a0al., 2019), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Ling et\u00a0al., 2020), significantly differs from that of healthy controls. Experimental studies have found that intestinal microbiota can cause or aggravate central nervous system diseases. In animal experiments, transplantation of the intestinal microbiota from patients with neurological diseases aggravated the disease in model animals or caused healthy animals to manifest the symptoms of diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (Li et\u00a0al., 2019) and multiple sclerosis (Berer et\u00a0al., 2017). The specific pathways through which intestinal microbes affect the central nervous system include the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, vagus and enteric nervous system, and microbial metabolites (Cryan et\u00a0 al., 2019). Neuro-modulating metabolites of microorganisms, including GABA, noradrenaline, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, and catecholamine, may play an important role in nervous system diseases (Morais et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThe aim of our study was to determine the impact of human gut microbiota from ET patients on tremor symptoms and behavior in mouse model. We\u00a0 previously found that tremor symptoms were gradually relieved in an ET patient who underwent 4 courses of washed microbiota transplantation for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (Liu et\u00a0al., 2020). This suggests a possible, yet undiscovered, link between the gut microbiota and ET. We\u00a0hypothesized that the transplantation of the gut microbiota of ET patients to a mouse model of harmaline-induced tremors would aggravate the tremor symptoms and affect the behavior of the mice. To test this hypothesis, we\u00a0colonized specific pathogen-free mice with microbiota collected from ET patients (henceforth called miceET) or sex- and age-matched\nhealthy controls (miceHC). We\u00a0used behavioral tests to compare the outcomes of transplanting the different gut microbiota to the mice. After inducing the harmaline tremor models, we\u00a0performed tremor scoring and repeated the behavioral tests at different time points to measure the tremor symptoms and motor performance. Histological sections of the mouse colon and small intestines were examined to grade the intestinal lesions. Differences in microbial diversity and composition were evaluated using 16S rDNA sequencing analysis of fecal samples from both groups of mice.

We\u00a0performed functional prediction based on the KEGG Orthology (KO) and EC databases and 16S sequencing data. Principal component analysis was performed based on the\nabundance statistics of functional annotations in the KO database, a database for studying gene function. A deviation was found between the confidence ellipses of the samples from the 2 groups, suggesting a difference in the functional composition of the microbiota between the 2 groups of mice (Figure\u00a06D).\nThe EC database mainly provides information on enzymes. With the background information mentioned above, the enzymes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of GABA were selected, and their relative abundances were calculated. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which corresponds to EC4.1.1.15\u00a0in the EC database, is the key enzyme involved in the decarboxylation of glutamate to GABA. The predicted relative abundance of GAD was significantly lower in miceET than that in miceHC (p < 0.05; Figure\u00a06E). This may indicate a decrease in GABA concentration and an increase in glutamate concentration in miceET.\n4-Aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-T) and L-3-aminoisobutyrate transaminase are the key enzymes involved in the metabolism of GABA, which correspond to EC2.6.1.19 and EC2.6.1.22 respectively, in the EC database. The predicted relative abundance of EC2.6.1.22 was significantly higher in miceET than in miceHC (p < 0.01). EC2.6.1.19 showed an increasing trend, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.051). The above result indicates that GABA metabolism might be\u00a0 more active in miceET (Figure\u00a06F).\nFIGURE\u00a05 Microbial diversity and species evaluations in miceET and miceHC.

            "text": "ET is a relatively common movement disorder. We\u00a0 previously reported a possible connection between ET and gut microbiota. In the present study, we\u00a0found that mice transplanted with fecal samples from ET patients exhibited worse motor performance in behavioral tests. After being injected with harmaline, these mice presented more severe tremor, longer tremor duration as well as worse motor performance. Pathological scoring of the colon and small intestinal tissues confirmed that mice transplanted with feces from ET patients presented severe intestinal lesions. The results of 16S rDNA sequencing showed that fecal samples from miceET had lower microbial diversity and significantly different composition compared with samples from miceHC. A significant correlation was noted between microbiota indexes and tremor/behavioral indexes. Moreover, functional prediction implicated GABA-related enzymes in the pathogenesis of ET. In conclusion, we\u00a0have demonstrated that gut dysbiosis plays a significant role in the occurrence and development of ET.\nThe novelty of our study is the use of animal models to study the potential contribution of the gut microbiota to the development and severity of ET. Extensive research has focused on the gut-brain axis and its role in neurological diseases (Sampson et\u00a0al., 2016; Berer et\u00a0al., 2017; Zheng et\u00a0al., 2019; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020). However, the association of ET with the gut-brain axis remains unclear. One study found that ET patients had a lower Chao1 index than the negative control group and patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, but found no significant difference in other indices of alpha diversity; it also reported a remarkable difference in beta diversity (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022), which is consistent with our results. Shannon index of fecal samples from patients with ET (ETd) were lower than that of samples from healthy controls (HCd) (Supplementary Figure S1A). Similar findings are also noticed in fecal samples from the two groups of recipient mice (ET and HC), although the difference was not statistically significant (ETd vs. HCd: p > 0.05 by ANOSIM analysis), in part due to the relative small sample size. However, the difference in dominant microbes and their relative abundance at the phylum level appear to be\u00a0significant in the mouse model (ET vs. HC: p = 0.001 by ANOSIM analysis). Overall, the fecal bacterial compositions in transplanted mice are largely reflected to those from their corresponding donors. Notably, relatively less Proteobacteria & Firmicutus but more Bacterioidota, Fusobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota were detected in receipient mice (Supplementary Figures S1B\u2013D). Further comparison on fecal microbiota from the two groups of recipient mice revealed that miceET had higher relative abundances of Fusobacteriota and Proteobacteria, which are both pathogenic bacteria with known roles in causing dysbiosis and abnormality of the digestive system (Shin et\u00a0al., 2015;\nFIGURE\u00a06 Correlation analysis and functional prediction in miceET and miceHC.

It could be\u00a0concluded from our study and previous reports confirm that ET patients may have less diverse and distinctly altered gut microbiota (Pan et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022), and these alterations could be\u00a0transferred to mice through FMT. In addition, we\u00a0found that miceET had a lower fecal pellet count, indicating impaired intestinal function and more severe pathological lesions. Our data suggest that the different microbial diversity and composition of the gut microbiota in miceET played an important role in the functional and pathological changes in the intestines, and eventually contributed to the pathogenesis and severity of ET, although the mechanisms between these altered gut microbiota and ET remain to be\u00a0elucidated.\nStudies have proved that the gut microbiota can affect behavioral performance by altering the levels of GABA and GABA receptors. For example, Lactobacillus rhamnosus has been proved to produce GABA and regulate GABA receptors in the brain, and could attenuate depression and anxiety-like behavior in mice (Bravo et\u00a0al., 2011). Studies on other neurological diseases have also demonstrated that behavioral changes might be\u00a0 elicited through the glutamateglutamine-GABA cycle (Olson et\u00a0 al., 2018; Zheng et\u00a0 al., 2019). Glutamic acid can be\u00a0catalyzed by GAD to form GABA, and glutamate can be\u00a0catalyzed by glutamine synthetase to form glutamine. Bacteria that can synthesize GABA exist in human gut microbiota (Barrett et\u00a0al., 2012; Strandwitz et\u00a0al., 2019). Some bacteria can encode GAD, and some bacteria can synthesize GABA by regulating GAD. It has been proven that abnormal levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate can affect the function of the central nervous system and behavior. A study found that germ-free mice transplanted with the gut microbiota of patients with schizophrenia developed schizophrenia-relevant behavior as well as lower glutamate levels but higher glutamine and GABA levels in the hippocampus (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2019). These results suggest that the gut microbiota of schizophrenic patients can worsen the behavior of mice, possibly by affecting the levels of neurotransmitters in their hippocampus. Another study focusing on refractory epilepsy discovered that gut microbiota could modulate host metabolism and seizure susceptibility in mice; reductions in systemic gammaglutamylated amino acids and elevated hippocampal GABA: glutamate levels correlated with seizure protection (Olson et\u00a0al., 2018). In both studies, the gut microbiota may have affected the behaviors and symptoms of mice through the glutamine-glutamate-GABA cycle, which is consistent with our results.\nSome limitations of this study must be\u00a0 acknowledged. First, we\u00a0used 6 donors each for the ET and HC groups, which may not represent the overall gut microbiota of all patients with ET. Second, although the harmaline model used in this study is the conventional model of ET, it differs from the chronic tremors seen in patients. The duration of the harmaline model rarely exceeds 3 h after drug injection. It is thus impossible to make animal models before transplanting different gut microbiota or to observe long-term tremor symptoms. Instead, we\u00a0administered the different microbiota to the 2 groups of mice first, and then observed whether there was any difference in tremors and motor performance after modeling. Third, tremor evaluation was performed using previously reported scoring criteria; however, the scoring results reported by different observers are not completely consistent because the animals were in a state of continuous tremor. Transgenic mouse models could be\u00a0used, and a more precise evaluating system could be\u00a0devised for future studies.\nFinally, the mechanism via which the gut microbiota affected the occurrence of ET was not deeply explored. The effects of the main contributing bacterial strains and their metabolites were not verified, and their role in ET still needs to be\u00a0studied. Although our study showed multiple differences to be\u00a0 caused by gut microbiota, the mechanisms involved require more rigorous investigation.\nIn conclusion, we\u00a0found that transplanting the gut microbiota from ET patients into mice induced severe tremors and worsened behavioral performance in mice. The possible causes include more severe intestinal lesions, lower gut microbiota diversity, and variation in the predicted enrichment of GABA-related enzymes. These findings suggest a crucial connection between ET and the gut microbiota, potentially providing a new diagnostic and therapeutic target for the management of ET in the future."
