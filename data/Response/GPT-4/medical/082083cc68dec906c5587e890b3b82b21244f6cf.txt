Investigate the Role of Other Inflammatory Cytokines and Pathways in Psoriasis and Cardiovascular Risk: This study focused on IL-1Î², IL-6, ADAMTS7, and the mTORC pathway. Future research could explore the involvement of other inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways in psoriasis and their relation to cardiovascular risk. This could include studying the role of other members of the ADAMTS family, different interleukins, or chemokines, and their interactions with cardiovascular diseases in psoriatic patients.

Longitudinal Studies on the Progression of Cardiovascular Disease in Psoriatic Patients: Conduct longitudinal studies to track the progression of cardiovascular disease in psoriatic patients over time. This would help in understanding how the identified biomarkers (like IL-6, ADAMTS7) and monocyte phenotypes evolve with the disease and their predictive value for cardiovascular events.

Examine the Effectiveness of mTORC Inhibitors in Psoriasis Treatment and Cardiovascular Risk Mitigation: Given the role of mTORC in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and atherosclerosis, research could focus on evaluating the therapeutic effects of mTORC inhibitors not only on skin lesions but also on reducing cardiovascular risks in psoriatic patients.

Study the Impact of Psoriasis Treatment on Monocyte Phenotype and Cardiovascular Risk Markers: Analyze how different psoriasis treatments (topical, systemic, biologics) affect the monocyte phenotypes and levels of cytokines and enzymes associated with cardiovascular risk. This could help in identifying treatments that might have beneficial or adverse effects on cardiovascular risk.

**Explore the Genetic and Molecular Basis of the Dissociated Inflammatory Response in M2 Monocytes**: The paper highlighted a distinct inflammatory response in M2 monocytes from psoriatic patients, particularly in relation to IL-6 levels and the diminished activity of the CXCL10-CXCR3 pathway. Further research could delve into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying this unique response. Understanding these mechanisms could uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention in both psoriasis and associated cardiovascular risks. This research might involve transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenetic analyses to map out the intricate network of signaling pathways activated in psoriatic patients.
