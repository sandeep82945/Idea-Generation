    "abstractText": "Drug resistance is a huge hurdle in tumor therapy. Tumor hypoxia contributes to chemotherapy resistance by inducing the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) pathway. To reduce tumor hypoxia, novel approaches have been devised, providing significant importance to reverse therapeutic resistance and improve the effectiveness of antitumor therapies. Herein, the nanosystem of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-templated manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (BSA/MnO2 NPs) loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) (DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs) developed in our previous report was further explored for their physicochemical properties and capacity to reverse DOX resistance because of their excellent photothermal and tumor microenvironment (TME) response effects. The DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs showed good biocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Meanwhile, DOX-BSA/ MnO2 NPs could greatly affect DOX pharmacokinetic properties, with prolonged circulation time and reduced cardiotoxicity, besides enhancing accumulation at tumor sites. DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs can interact with H2O2 and H + in TME to form oxygen and exhibit excellent photothermal effect to further alleviate hypoxia due to MnO2, reversing DOX resistance by down-regulating HIF-1\u03b1 expression and significantly improving the antitumor efficiency in DOX-resistant human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7/ADR) tumor model. The hypoxia-ameliorated photothermal MnO2 platform is a promising strategy for revering DOX resistance.",

Tumor hypoxia contributes to chemotherapy resistance by inducing the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) pathway. To reduce tumor hypoxia, novel approaches have been devised, providing significant importance to reverse therapeutic resistance and improve the effectiveness of antitumor therapies. Herein, the nanosystem of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-templated manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (BSA/MnO2 NPs) loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) (DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs) developed in our previous report was further explored for their physicochemical properties and capacity to reverse DOX resistance because of their excellent photothermal and tumor microenvironment (TME) response effects. The DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs showed good biocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Meanwhile, DOX-BSA/ MnO2 NPs could greatly affect DOX pharmacokinetic properties, with prolonged circulation time and reduced cardiotoxicity, besides enhancing accumulation at tumor sites. DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs can interact with H2O2 and H\n+ in TME to form oxygen and exhibit excellent photothermal effect to further alleviate hypoxia due to MnO2, reversing DOX resistance by down-regulating HIF-1\u03b1 expression and significantly improving the antitumor efficiency in DOX-resistant human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7/ADR) tumor model. The hypoxia-ameliorated photothermal MnO2 platform is a promising strategy for revering DOX resistance.\nKEYWORDS\ndrug resistance, hypoxia, photothermal-manganese dioxide, doxorubicin, tumor microenvironment response\n1 Introduction\nCurrently, chemotherapy remains an important remedy for tumor treatment, while drug resistance is the primary obstacle that causes chemotherapy failure (Wei et al., 2021). Since tumor cells progress rapidly together with limited neovascularization, hypoxia is a characteristic of the tumor microenvironment (TME), defined by a low pH value, a high level of glutathione (GSH), and coupled with reactive oxygen species (including H2O2) in high concentration (Sharma et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021). Experimental and clinical research has indicated that tumor hypoxia is the leading cause of chemotherapy resistance, which would trigger tumor recurrence, as well as metastasis, causing treatment failure, in"

Moreover, hypoxia elevates chemotherapy drug resistance by inducing the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) pathway, which relates to angiogenesis, cancer growth, metastasis, metabolic reprogramming, as well as therapy resistance (Rankin and Giaccia, 2016; McAleese et al., 2021; Li H. et al., 2022). Therefore, HIF-1\u03b1 is essential in reversing drug resistance (Jing et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019).\nConsequently, several techniques, including transporting oxygen (O2) into tumors through artificial blood substitutes (such as perfluorocarbon) or generating O2 in situ through O2generating nano-delivery systems, overcome hypoxia in tumors that reduces the HIF-1\u03b1 expression (Wang et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2021). Recently, developing TME-sensitive nanoagents is a promising approach to supply tremendous and sustained O2 production besides regulating the undesirable TME (Chen et al., 2016), therefore achieving better therapeutic outcomes against drug resistance. Until now, the supply of O2 according to the high reactivity of manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) with H2O2 in a tumor acid environment is advantageous over other approaches to supplying O2 (Yu et al., 2019). Meanwhile, MnO2 NPs can be reduced to Mn2+ in glutathione (GSH) presence, leading to MnO2 NPs decomposition. The TME-responsive potential of MnO2 NPs would facilitate on-demand drug release. Importantly, kidneys can quickly eliminate harmless water-soluble Mn2+ ions from the body to prevent systemic buildup and chronic toxicity, providing great benefits for in vivo applications (Yang et al., 2017), in contrast to several other non-biodegradable inorganic nanomaterials (including mesoporous silica). Therefore, MnO2 NPs are excellent candidates for alleviating hypoxia in TME.\nHowever, a single treatment to alleviate hypoxia shows limited effectiveness due to the complexity of TME. The dense extracellular matrix, increased interstitial fluid pressure, as well as irregular blood\nflow frequently act as physical barriers to the passage of medication or nanodrug through tumor blood microvessels into hypoxic areas (Chen et al., 2022). One of the non-invasive clinical treatment modalities is photothermal therapy (PTT), which relies on photothermal agents converting energy from light to heat, which can reinforce the extravasation of NPs treatment into the cancer interstitium. PTT can accelerate blood flow into tumors to help alleviate hypoxia, exhibiting competitive advantages in overcoming tumor drug resistance (Jiang et al., 2020). Moreover, PTT reinforces tumor vascular permeability, allowing antitumor drugs delivery to deep tumor tissues and elevating the sensitivity of tumor cells resistant to chemotherapeutic treatments by suppressing the efflux transporters expression, including multidrug resistanceassociated protein 1 (MDR-1) (Souslova and Averill-Bates, 2004). Furthermore, developing a nanosystem that combines PTT with O2generated NPs is a promising strategy for overcoming hypoxia in tumor sites and improving drug resistance, enhancing chemotherapy efficacy. Zhu et al. (2021) constructed Ru@MnO2 nanozymes, which showed both excellent photothermal conversion efficiency by Ru NPs and catalytic activity by MnO2 NPs to catalyze endogenous H2O2 for O2 production, reliving the hypoxic TME and enhancing chemotherapy efficiency. However, the complex synthetic steps, such as using nano-carriers to load O2-generating agents and PTAs, are time-consuming and probably lead to low drug loading and encapsulation efficiency, resulting in restricting the antitumor effect. Moreover, the use of too many reagents or excipients can reduce the biocompatibility of NPs, probably affecting their in vivo application. Therefore, developing a facile way to synthesize multifunctional NPs to improve tumor hypoxia to reverse drug resistance is of great significance.\nIn our previous study (Chen et al., 2022), bovine serum albumin (BSA) was employed as an organic reference to produce BSA/MnO2 NPs through biomimetic mineralization, a\nSCHEME 1 Diagrammatic representation of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs as a multifunctional platform to reverse DOX resistance (EPR: enhanced permeability and retention; DOX: Doxorubicin; MnO2: manganese dioxide; GSH: glutathione; HIF-1\u03b1: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\ngreen, facile, and promising strategy to synthesize NPs for tumor therapy (Wang et al., 2020). The developed nanosystem has many advantages (Scheme 1): 1) BSA/MnO2 NPs showed increased biocompatibility, good stability, and high-water solubility due to the existence of BSA. 2) Importantly, by targeting the albuminbinding protein SPARC, which is upregulated in most cancerous cell cases, BSA can increase intratumoral accumulation via albumin receptor (gp60)-mediated transcytosis (Desai, 2007). 3) BSA/MnO2 NPs are multifunctional carriers that exhibit photothermal conversion ability under 635 nm laser irradiation and can catalyze O2 production at tumor sites. 4) Furthermore, the chemotherapy agent, doxorubicin (DOX), was loaded on BSA/MnO2 NPs by simply stirring in an aqueous solution to construct DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs depending on MnO2 along with DOX coordination without further modification, and with high encapsulation efficiency (99.33%) and drug loading capacity (23.88%). 5) A 32.5 nm particle size DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs prolonged blood circulation and efficient cancer buildup, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Our previous research has proved the excellent photothermal effects, as well as the ability to relieve hypoxic TME of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs (Chen et al., 2022). It inspired us to explore its ability to reverse chemotherapy resistance. In particular, the combined BSA/MnO2 nanoplatform generated the thermal ability of O2 and was the first used to investigate the ability to reverse DOX resistance. Therefore, our objective was to explore the physicochemical properties and the capacity to reverse the drug resistance of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs."

These outcomes stated that BSA/MnO2 NPs were promising carriers to enhance the DOX chemotherapy effect and could effectively reverse DOX resistance in vitro.\n3.4 In vitro cellular uptake investigation\nThe efficacy of anti-cancer drugs relies on their intracellular accumulation of drugs, particularly in drug resistance cancer cells (Li J. et al., 2022). Therefore, confocal fluorescence microscopy (CLSM) was used to visualize the drug uptake in MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06\ncells following 6 h of incubation, while the flow cytometer quantified the mean fluorescence intensity.\nFigure 2C illustrates that the red fluorescence was much lower in DOX-BSA/MnO2 NP-treated cells contrasted with the freeDOX-treated cells, indicating the cell internalization of DOX-BSA/ MnO2 NPs was significantly slower than free DOX, which may be because of the difference between DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs endocytosis along with DOX passive diffusion mechanism and different DOX release rate of DOX together DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs (Wallat et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). DOX acts mainly by entering the nucleus and causing DNA damage (Yang et al., 2022). The DOX fluorescence was mainly accumulated in MCF-7 cell nuclei following incubation with free DOX along with DOX-BSA/ MnO2 NPs. However, DOX fluorescence was mainly detected in\nMCF-7/ADR cells cytoplasm following the free DOX incubation, which may be caused by drug efflux, the key reason for drug resistance (Li et al., 2019). Notably, DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs have mainly localized in the MCF-7/ADR cell nuclei, increasing the potential to reverse resistance by reducing drug efflux.\nAccording to the CLSM findings, the cellular fluorescence intensities of MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells subjected to free DOX were approximately seven and two times greater, respectively, compared to those following DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs therapy (Figures 2D\u2013F).

In contrast, it could not be measured after injection of DOX solution, revealing the enhanced tumor targeting capability of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs compared with free DOX, which was expected to provide higher antitumor efficacy. This prolonged tumor retention behavior of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs was probably caused by the EPR impact due to the drug carriers in a narrow size range from about 10 to 100 nm (Petros and DeSimone, 2010) and through active targeting mediated by gp60-cellar protein-SPARC (Noorani et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2021).\nThe effectiveness of DOX is usually limited because of its cardiac toxicity (Wei et al., 2020).

The fluorescence intensity of the ICG-BSA/ MnO2 NPs group was elevated compared to the free ICG group at the tumor sites (Figure 4C). The results demonstrated that ICG-BSA/MnO2 NPs had a long circulation time and good targeting capacity, improving the in vivo therapeutic effect. Moreover, the kidneys in the ICG-BSA/ MnO2 NPs group and the livers in the free ICG group showed stronger fluorescence signals, respectively, indicating that the kidney metabolized NPs mainly while the liver metabolized the free ICG. These findings were consistent with those of biodistribution in Section \u20323.5.3\u2032, and the optimal PTT treatment time was 1 h after drug administration.\n3.7 In vivo therapeutic effectiveness\nBALB/c nude mice bearing MCF-7/ADR cell line were employed to explore whether the DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPmediated hypoxia ameliorated and photothermal effect would reverse the DOX resistance. At approximately 100 mm3 tumor volumes, the mice were allocated by random to six groups (n = 3), medicated thrice with saline, DOX, BSA/MnO2 NPs, BSA/ MnO2 NPs + laser irradiation, DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs, or DOXBSA/MnO2 NPs + laser irradiation on days 1, 4, and 7 (Figure 5A). Both MnO2, as well as DOX doses, were 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively, with 635 nm laser (1.5 W/cm2, 10 min) tumors irradiation at 1 h after injection in the laser treatment group.\nThe temperature change was obtained via infrared thermal imaging to visually investigate the temperature fluctuation of MCF-7/ADR-bearing nude mice of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs in vivo. The surface temperature of tumor site in mice administrated saline was non-significantly increased and only from 35.5\u00b0C to 42.6\u00b0C under 635 nm laser irradiation for 10 min (Figure 5B). In contrast, the irradiated tumor tissues of BSA/ MnO2 NP- together with DOX-BSA/MnO2 NP-treated mice showed a significant temperature elevation. The surface temperature of tumor increased from 34.9\u00b0C to 60.6\u00b0C and 33.2\u00b0C\u201360.7\u00b0C, respectively, which was high enough to kill malignant cells (Dun et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2022), demonstrating DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs exhibited good targeting to drug resistance breast cancer cells, allowing more NPs to aggregate at the tumor location and exert better PTT effects.\nSubsequently, we evaluated the capability of DOX-BSA/ MnO2 NPs to suppress DOX-resistant tumor proliferation in vivo. Compared with the saline-treated group, the weak antitumor ability of BSA/MnO2 NPs was observed since MnO2 produces free radicals (Figure 5C), which destroy cancer (Veroniaina et al., 2021). With BSA/MnO2 NPs + laser irradiation, the tumor volume exhibited a significant reduction, indicating that hyperthermia could effectively cause cell ablation. Tumor growth in the DOX treatment group was marginally limited due to the inferior tumor-targeted ability of\nDOX (Huang et al., 2019). Interestingly, at the same concentration of DOX, DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs showed a significant reduction in tumor development than free DOX. DOX was less efficient in hypoxic than normoxic environments (Zeng et al., 2021). Therefore, the enhancement of antitumor action of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs as a result of the MnO2 for reliving tumor hypoxia. DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs plus laser irradiation medicated group had the greatest therapeutic activity with minimal tumor volume after 22 days of treatment due to the excellent PTT effect and O2-generating ability of BSA/ MnO2 NPs. The tumor mass was removed after the therapy was completed following a similar pattern (Figure 5D).\nAdditionally, the antitumor efficacy of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs was assessed by HE staining and TUNEL assay (Figure 5E). Similar to tumor growth inhibition, HE staining results showed that most tumor cells exhibited obvious nuclear damage after DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs + laser irradiation treatment. TUNEL staining also presented the highest level of tumor cell apoptosis of DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs + laser irradiation group, as demonstrated by the brightest green fluorescent signals at tumor sites.\nHIF-1\u03b1 is crucial in drug resistance, which would be activated in a hypoxic environment and overexpressed within distinct common solid malignancies, such as breast, colon, and gastric (Wigerup et al., 2016; Shukla et al., 2017). Accordingly, DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs\u2019 capability to control hypoxic conditions in tumor tissue was investigated via HIF-1\u03b1 immunofluorescence histochemistry. HIF-1\u03b1 was more downregulated in the O2-generating groups than the saline-treated mice, including the group of BSA/MnO2 NPs, BSA/MnO2 NPs + laser irradiation, DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs, and DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs + laser irradiation, as demonstrated by the significantly reduced hypoxia signals indicated by HIF-1\u03b1 antibody staining (Figure 5E). Additionally, further downregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 was observed after NPs plus laser irradiation, proving that photothermal heating could improve vascular perfusion, cell membrane permeability, and tumor hypoxia (Tang et al., 2019). The results demonstrated that BSA/ MnO2 NPs or DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs were administered to the hypoxic tumor region, followed by a reaction with H2O2 and H + to release O2 effectively. Hypoxia alleviation led to HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition.\nThe body weight was assessed during treatment to test DOXBSA/MnO2 NPs biosafety. Until the end of the observation, the body weight showed a non-significant difference (Figure 6A). Moreover, the HE staining of the main organs in all treatment groups revealed inapparent inflammatory damage and tissue damage, indicating the good biocompatibility of NPs (Figure 6B). Finally, these in vivo findings indicated that DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs could reverse DOX resistance showing better anticancer activity as well as biocompatibility."

Moreover, hyperthermia induced by BSA/MnO2 NPs relieved hypoxia, reversing DOX resistance by HIF-1\u03b1 expression downregulation and improving the antitumor efficiency. Besides, DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and hemocompatibility, which were suitable for their in vivo application. Meanwhile, DOX-BSA/MnO2 NPs could prolong circulation time in vivo, enhance tumor site accumulation, and reduce the cardiotoxicity of DOX, resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficiency. Overall, the as-prepared DOX-BSA/MnO2 nanoplatform was a promising therapeutic agent for reversing DOX reversal for better clinical outcomes."
