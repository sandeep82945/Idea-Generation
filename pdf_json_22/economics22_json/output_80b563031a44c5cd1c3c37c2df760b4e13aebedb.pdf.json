    "abstractText": "Background and Objective There is increasing interest in preference-accompanied measures of health for paediatric populations. The child-friendly EQ-5D version, EQ-5D-Y-3L, is one such instrument, but the lack of a Dutch value set prevents its use in economic evaluations of healthcare interventions in the Netherlands. This study aims at covering this gap by collecting preferences using a standardised protocol for deriving EQ-5D-Y-3L value sets. Methods Composite time trade-off data were collected using videoconferencing interviews, with each respondent completing ten composite time trade-off tasks. Discrete choice experiment data were collected using an online survey, with respondents each completing 15 paired comparisons. Respondents completed these tasks considering what they prefer for a hypothetical 10-year-old child. Discrete choice experiment data were analysed using a ten-parameter mixed-logit model and anchored to the quality-adjusted life-year scale using the mean observed composite time trade-off values. Results The study collected preferences for 197 respondents using composite time trade-off and for 959 respondents using a discrete choice experiment. The discrete choice experiment sample was representative for the Dutch population in terms of age and sex. The level 3 weight for pain/discomfort was the largest, followed by feeling worried, sad or unhappy, usual activities, mobility and self-care. Health state values ranged between \u22120.218 and 1. Conclusions This study generated a Dutch value set for the EQ-5D-Y-3L, which can be used for the computation of qualityadjusted life-years for economic evaluations of healthcare interventions in paediatric populations. * Bram Roudijk roudijk@euroqol.org 1 EuroQol Research Foundation, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 2 Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 3 Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands 4 Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands",

            "text": "The EQ-5D-Y-3L instrument is a generic health-related quality-of-life measure aimed at paediatric populations, such as children and adolescents between ages 8 and 15 years [1]. It was developed by adapting the adult version of the EQ-5D, to make the labels and descriptors relevant for children and adolescents [2]. Several studies have tested the psychometric properties of the EQ-5D-Y, generally demonstrating the instrument is valid and responsive [3, 4]. Instruments such as the EQ-5D-Y-3L are suitable for both population studies and for economic evaluations. For use in economic evaluations,\na value set, i.e. scoring based on preferences, is commonly employed.\nIn the Netherlands, the National Health Care Institute, Zorginstituut Nederland, recommends that new technologies and interventions should be assessed using a cost-utility analysis, making quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) the outcome of reference [5]. The EQ-5D-5L and the accompanying Dutch value set is the preferred instrument for the computation of QALYs [6]. Although value sets for Dutch versions of the EQ-5D family of instruments are available, there is currently no EQ-5D-Y-3L value set for the Netherlands. This is problematic for three reasons. First, preferences for health states might differ for child and adult beneficiaries [7, 8]. Second, the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-Y-3L is different from the adult EQ-5D-3L, resulting de facto in a different classification system. Third, although EQ-5D-Y-3L value sets exist for other countries, it is not recommended to use these in the Netherlands. Earlier work with value sets for adult versions of the EQ-5D instruments has suggested using another countries\u2019 value set may misrepresent the preferences of the Dutch population [9]. The same is likely to be true for child versions, thus a Dutch version is needed.\nKey Points\nThis study generated a value set for the EQ-5D-Y-3L instrument using a standardised protocol, which enables the use of utility index scores in economic evaluations in paediatric populations in the Netherlands.\nBoth composite time trade-off data and discrete choice experiment data were collected, and modelled independently. The discrete choice experiment data were used for the final value set, with the composite time trade-off data being used to anchor the discrete choice experiment values onto the quality-adjusted life-year scale.\nPain and feeling worried, sad or unhappy were identified as the most important health dimensions, with looking after yourself receiving the smallest weight.\nThe latter entails asking adults of the general public to imagine a 10-year-old child experiencing health problems. We depart from the standard protocol by including a different and larger set of health states in the cTTO, allowing us to model the cTTO data independently. This enables comparisons between DCE-based and cTTO-based value sets for this instrument. Furthermore, the cTTO data were collected through videoconferencing interviews, rather than the recommended face-to-face interviews, owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic."

For UA, examples relevant to the paediatric population are provided: for example, going to school, hobbies, sports, playing or doing things with friends.\nOn each of these five dimensions, EQ-5D-Y-3L differentiates between three levels of severity of problems: (1) no problems; (2) some problems and (3) a lot of problems/very worried, sad or unhappy in the last dimension. With these five dimensions with three levels of severity each, the instrument can distinguish between 243 different unique health states for individuals aged between 8 and 15 years. Five-digit numerical codes are assigned to each health state, with the place of a digit in this code indicating the dimension order as MO, SC, UA, PD and AD. The numbers themselves are then either 1, 2 or 3, referring to no problems, some problems and a lot of problems, respectively. An example of this is state \u201c21323\u201d, which is defined as having some problems with walking about, no problems with washing or dressing, a lot of problems doing usual activities, some pain or discomfort and very worried, sad or unhappy."

Complete composite time trade-off uses an indifference procedure to elicit the preferences of respondents, whom are asked to choose between two lives for a hypothetical 10-year-old child, A and B, or state that they are indifferent. Life A always equals a number between 0 and 10 of life-years in full health, while life B equals 10 years in some health state X. The number of years in full health in life A is varied until indifference is reached. If a respondent prefers immediate death to living life B, he/she enters the lead-time\n1 Abbreviations were harmonized with those used in the adult instrument.\nPreliminary work has been conducted on the valuation of health states for the EQ-5D-Y-3L instrument, leading to the development of a standardised protocol for conducting EQ5D-Y-3L valuation studies [7, 10]. Four national value sets have already been published using this protocol, in Slovenia, Germany, Spain and Japan [11\u201314]. In this protocol, valuation data are collected in two samples: (1) a representative sample of respondents each completing paired comparisons in a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and (2) a smaller sample of respondents that each complete composite time trade-off (cTTO) tasks [15]. Discrete choice experiment data are used for the estimation of the value set, using logit models. However, as these models produce values on a latent scale, the cTTO data are used to anchor the DCE values on the full health (1) and dead (0) scale, necessary for QALY computations, using a mapping approach or by rescaling on a single cTTO mean value. In both the cTTO and DCE, respondents are asked to imagine a 10-year-old child, who is experiencing the health states described in the choice tasks.\nThe aim of this study is to develop a value set for the EQ5D-Y-3L instrument for the Netherlands. The availability of such a value set would enable a cost-utility analysis for paediatric interventions using values specifically generated for children and adolescents aged between 8 and 15 years."

Five mild health states (21111, 12111, 11211, 11121 and 11112), the worst health state 33333 and four additional intermediate health states were added to the orthogonal array. These were selected to maintain near-orthogonality after adding the mild and worst health states to the design. The 28 states were assigned to three blocks of ten health states each, with all blocks containing health state 33333 and at least one mild health state. The DCE survey uses the efficient design suggested in the protocol, with a level overlap, meaning two identical levels, on two of the five dimensions in each choice situation [10]. The full design comprises 150 pairs of health states, blocked into ten blocks of 15 choice tasks per respondent.\nTwo samples of data were collected; a small target sample of 200 respondents completing ten cTTO tasks each and a larger target sample of 1000 respondents, each completing the 15 DCE choice situations. Ramos-Go\u00f1i et\u00a0al. provide a detailed justification for using these sample sizes [10]. The respondents for the DCE survey and cTTO interviews were recruited by two different market research companies. For the DCE survey, respondents were recruited from a large online panel. Respondents received an invitation by e-mail to participate in the study with a link to the survey. For the cTTO sample, respondents were recruited from a different smaller panel. Respondents were invited by the panel company to an online-administered interview. Hard quota sampling was applied for age and sex for the DCE study, with soft quotas for education because of the difficulty of recruiting respondents with a lower education. For the cTTO study, soft quotas were set for both age, sex and education. To reach certain demographic groups, recruitment via social media was used as an additional recruitment strategy for the cTTO sample.\nThe cTTO data were collected by four trained interviewers through videoconferencing interviews. Interviewers\nconnected with the respondents through videoconferencing software and shared their screens to show the respondents the questions and tasks to be completed. Videoconferencing interviews have been used in several valuation studies and methodological studies, and have so far shown to be feasible [19\u201321]. The standard EQ-VT 2.1 software was used [16, 22]. First, each respondent completed the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, followed by a short demographic survey and the EQ-5D-Y-3L, to get acquainted with the instrument. Subsequently, the respondents entered the cTTO task, valuing \u201cbeing in a wheelchair\u201d, followed by a state either \u201cmuch better than being in a wheelchair\u201d or \u201cmuch worse than being in a wheelchair\u201d, depending on their answer to the first question. Next, respondents were presented three practice questions using EQ-5D-Y-3L health states (states 21121, 23332 and 13211), followed by ten more health states from one of the three blocks of the study design, presented in a random order. This was followed by the feedback module, debriefing questions and additional demographic questions. The feedback module is a procedure in which respondents are presented the rank order of their answers in the cTTO, allowing them to flag any mistakes [23].\nThe DCE data were collected through an online survey. Each respondent completed the self-description of the EQ5D-5L, followed by several demographic questions and the self-description of the EQ-5D-Y-3L. Subsequently, respondents were presented the DCE survey, followed by additional sociodemographic questions. Each respondent completed 15 DCE paired comparisons; one block of questions from the efficient design, plus three dominant choice pairs used as a quality check. The first paired comparison was always a dominant pair, while the other two dominant pairs were randomly placed between the other 15 choice pairs."

Furthermore, it was assessed whether the lead-time TTO was explained to each respondent and whether there were any inconsistent responses.

Furthermore, models for health state valuations using cTTO often suffer from heteroskedasticity, as the variance in responses for milder health states is much smaller than those for more severe health states. We first test, using a Breusch\u2013Pagan test, whether heteroskedasticity is present, and then account for this by defining an explicit variance function, where the variance j of the error term j is dependent on the levels of the dimensions of the EQ-5D-Y-3L of the health state, as in Equation\u00a02:\nThe DCE data are modelled using conditional logit models and mixed-logit models.

The Dutch weights assigned to health problems were much larger than those found in Japan, smaller than those found in Slovenia and Spain, and relatively similar to those found in Germany. In all countries, PD was the most important dimension, and SC the least important, except for Germany, where MO was the least important. However, the relative ratio of the largest level 3 weight compared to the smallest level 3 weight was 2.62 in the Netherlands, 2 in Slovenia, 3.86 in Japan, 2.37 in Spain and 3.56 in Germany. This shows that Dutch respondents placed relatively more emphasis on a single health dimension for children as compared with Slovenian respondents, but relatively less than Japanese and German respondents. Generally, the Dutch value set was most similar to the German value set, with roughly the same scale length, but slightly higher values for milder health states and lower values for more severe states.\nNegative values accounted for 3.3% of health states in the Dutch value set, indicating that they are considered worse than dead. The lowest score predicted in the current study was \u22120.218, for state 33333. In Germany, Spain, Japan and Slovenia, these were \u22120.283, \u22120.539, 0.288 and \u22120.691, respectively. In Japan, no negative values were predicted in the final model, compared to 6.6% in Germany, 16.1% in Spain and 20.6% in Slovenia. This shows that Dutch respondents found only a small set of health states to be worse than dead for children. These findings are similar to findings for the EQ-5D-5L instrument, with Japan showing higher values and Germany lower values [12, 13]. An exception is Spain, showing similar values for the worst health state in the EQ-5D-5L instrument, but lower values for the\nEQ-5D-Y-3L instrument [14]. For Slovenia, no EQ-5D-5L value set is currently available [11]\nThe relative importance of the health dimensions is roughly similar between EQ-5D-Y-3L and EQ-5D-5L in the Netherlands [6]. For EQ-5D-5L, PD and AD receive the largest weight, followed by MO, UA and SC, while for EQ5D-Y-3L, PD receives the largest weight, followed by AD, UA, MO and SC. The values assigned to the worst health states (\u22120.446 for 55555 in the EQ-5D-5L, and \u22120.218 for\u00a033333 in the EQ-5D-Y-3L) differ substantially, with the percentage of negative values being higher in the EQ-5D-5L value set at 15.5%, compared with 3.3% for the EQ-5D-Y-3L value set. This may mean that Dutch respondents consider the same health dimensions important for both adults and\nchildren, but differ in the degree in which they are willing to give up life-years to avoid these health problems, which may reflect a different willingness to trade between adults and children. These differences may be partially caused by a different level structure of the instruments, different descriptors (e.g. anxiety/depression in the EQ-5D-5L vs worried, sad or unhappy in the EQ-5D-Y-3L) or different measurement strategies (EQ-5D-5L value set is cTTO based, while the EQ-5D-Y-3L value set is DCE based). Figure\u00a03 shows a substantial disagreement between cTTO-based and DCE-based value sets for the EQ-5D-Y-3L, which may also reflect the differences in valuation protocols between the EQ-5D-Y-3L and EQ-5D-5L value sets. There is an ongoing discussion on how to interpret differences between youth and adult value sets. One study provides qualitative evidence that respondents differ in the rate at which they are willing to trade life-years to relieve health problems for adults or children [27]. Furthermore, there appears to be more variance in the values assigned to health states for children [8]. One reason for this could be that respondents assign values to health states for other, hypothetical persons in the valuation of health states for children. Incorporating adolescent preferences into the valuations may overcome this issue, and has been shown to be feasible in the valuation of other instruments [28]. A review by Rowen et\u00a0al. identifies future directions for research that may help us better understand the difference between youth and adult health state values [29]."

            "text": "Composite time trade-off data were collected through videoconferencing interviews rather than the recommended face-to-face interviews. Collecting cTTO data via face-toface interviews was not feasible, owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, with the Netherlands experiencing lockdown measures between October 2020 until June 2021. Therefore, it was decided to interview respondents using videoconferencing software. Preliminary studies have shown the feasibility of this mode of administration [19, 20]. A more recent study shows that the mode of administration is unlikely to lead to different values when employing videoconferencing interviews. However, sample selection, i.e. differences in responders due to the recruitment strategy, may affect the collected values [21]. Another limitation of this study is that for the cTTO data, soft quota sampling was used, leading to an over-sampling of the highly educated, while obtaining a reasonable balance of sex and age in the cTTO sample. Furthermore, in the DCE survey, there was an under-sampling of those with the lowest attained education, compensated by those with lower-level and upper-middlelevel education. Over-sampling highly educated respondents is a problem observed more frequently in valuation studies for various instruments, regardless of the mode of\nadministration [30\u201334]. The sampling issue may be partially related to the choice of recruitment strategy, by employing panel companies to recruit respondents for the cTTO and DCE samples. Last, a limitation of the current study is that the performance of the health state design used for the cTTO cannot be assessed directly with the one recommended by Ramos-Go\u00f1i et\u00a0al., as the Ramos-Go\u00f1i et\u00a0al. design is not a subset of the currently used design [10]. Although anchoring the DCE values onto the cTTO data seems to work well with a larger set of health states, we make no claim of superiority, as no direct comparison can be made.\nA strength of this study is regardless of restrictions related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was still possible to collect cTTO data using computer-assisted personal interviews. Furthermore, the data were collected following a strict protocol as outlined by Ramos-Go\u00f1i et\u00a0al., with quality-control procedures being implemented in both the cTTO and DCE data collection [10]. No issues with data quality were identified during the collection of the cTTO data, as defined by EuroQol\u2019s quality-control process [24]."

            "text": "This study yields a value set for the EQ-5D-Y-3L instrument, enabling a cost utility analysis for paediatric interventions in the Netherlands. Pain/discomfort was identified as the most important dimension, followed by feeling worried, sad or unhappy, usual activities, mobility and looking after myself. Of all health states, 3.3% had a negative value, and the lowest value assigned to any health state was \u22120.218. The relative importance of the health dimensions seems to be the same between the adult EQ-5D-5L instrument and the paediatric EQ-5D-Y-3L instrument. However, other properties, such as the scale length and the percentage if negative values, seem to differ between the value sets.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s40273- 022- 01192-0.\nDeclarations\nFunding This study was funded by the EuroQol Research Foundation (EQ project 100-2020RA).\nConflicts of Interest Bram Roudijk, Stefan Lipman, Peep Stalmeier and Aureliano Paolo Finch reported receiving grants from the EuroQol Research Foundation during the conduct of the study.
