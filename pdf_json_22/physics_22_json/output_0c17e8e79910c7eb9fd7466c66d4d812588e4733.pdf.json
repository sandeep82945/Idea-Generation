Box 43, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland\n4ISC-CNR, UOS Dipartimento di Fisica, Universita\u0300 di Firenze, I-50019, Sesto Fiorentino (FI), Italy (Dated: March 28, 2022)\nIn this work we design a procedure to estimate the minimum size beyond which a system is amenable to a classical-like description, i.e. a description based on representative points in classical phase-spaces. This is obtained by relating quantum states to representative points via Generalized Coherent States (GCS), and designing a POVM for GCS discrimination. Conditions upon this discrimination are defined, such that the POVM results convey enough information to meet our needs for reliability and precision, as gauged by two parameters , of our arbitrary choice, and \u03b4, set by the experimental apparatus, respectively. The procedure implies a definition of what is meant by \u201dsize\u201d of the system, in terms of the number N of elementary constituents that provide the global algebra leading to the phase-space for the emergent classical-like description. The above conditions on GCS discrimination can be thus turned into N > Nt( , \u03b4), where Nt( , \u03b4) is the threshold size mentioned in the title. The specific case of a magnetic system is considered, with details of a gedanken experiment presented and thoroughly commented. Results for pseudo-spin and bosonic systems are also given.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe profound difference between classical and quantum physics fosters the idea that systems are either classical or quantum, as if the adjective refer to an intrinsic nature of physical objects. The idea is wrong: it is just a matter of what scientific theory best describes the behaviour of the system under analysis, in the regime of parameters in which one is interested. Moreover, the recent advancements in quantum technologies urge the adoption of a viewpoint from which classical and quantum features can be seen together, and the origin of the former from the latter be clear. In fact a functioning quantum device acts as a mediator between elementary quantum components (such as the qubits) and complex classical-like apparatuses (including human beings), in a way such that a quantum treatment of the latter is out of reach, and a classical-like description of the former might result inadequate. The same quest for a hybrid quantum-classical approach arises in the framework of cosmology, where macroscopic objects manifests themselves according to the laws of classical physics, via general relativity, and yet have quantum traits, as is the case of black holes and their Hawking radiation [1]. To this respect, one should bear in mind that macroscopicity in itself does not guarantee the obliteration of quantum features, unless further assumptions are made [2\u20134].\nIn this work we show that results from quantum measurements can produce acceptable (in terms of reliability and precision) classical-like descriptions of large enough systems, with the size represented by the number N that counts their elementary constituents, or degrees of freedom, or dynamical variables, or whatever such that N \u2192 \u221e is a necessary condition for a classical-like behaviour to emerge. Our result consists in defining a fit for purpose POVM [5\u20137], and derive a threshold value of N above which its outcomes allow one to identify the classical state of the system, i.e. its representative point on a classical phase-space, precisely enough to provide the required accuracy, given the resolution of the available measuring apparatus. A paradigmatic spin-system\nis explicitly considered to serve as an example and give a figure for the threshold value.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: in Sec. II we introduce Generalized Coherent States (GCS) and their relevant properties with respect to the large-N limit, defined in Sec. III. The POVM for GCS discrimination is defined in Sec. IV, where we set the conditions ensuring that a classical-like description can emerge from the POVM results themselves. Finally, in Sec. V we consider the case of a magnetic system, for which we describe a gedanken experiment realizing the above mentioned POVM and discuss the possible use one can make of its results, as N is varied. Details on some formal aspects are given in the Appendices A, B, and C."

            "text": "A powerful tool for studying problems where quantum and classical features coexist is the formalism of GCS, that provides a common semantic framework for quantum and classical physics. Their group-theoretic construction goes as follows [8\u201310].\nConsider a quantum theory defined [32] by a Lie algebra g, and a unitary irreducible representation of the corresponding groupG on some Hilbert spaceH. Choose a state (normalized vector) |R\u3009 \u2208 H and identify the elements of G that leave |R\u3009 unchanged up to an irrelevant phase factor: it is easily checked that they form a normal subgroup F \u2282 G, and hence define a quotient G/F . GCS are defined as\n|\u2126\u3009 := \u2126\u0302 |R\u3009 , \u2126\u0302 \u2208 G/F . (1)\nEach \u2126\u0302 \u2208 G/F is related, by definition, to a GCS |\u2126\u3009 ; moreover, the quotient-manifold theorem [11] ensures that each \u2126\u0302 is biunivocally associated with a point \u2126 of a manifold M, which is demonstrated symplectic [8], with the properties of a phase-space. This establishes one of the main traits of GCS,\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n13 58\n7v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 5\nM ar\n2 02\n2\n2 namely that each coherent state |\u2126\u3009 \u2208 H is univocally related to the representative point of a physical state, \u2126 \u2208 M, as intended by the classical hamiltonian formalism.\nGCS are normalized but non-orthogonal, and provide a resolution of the identity on H via \u222b M d\u00b5(\u2126) |\u2126\u3009 \u3008\u2126| = I\u0302, where d\u00b5(\u2126) is invariant w.r.t. the action of the operators \u2126\u0302. When g admits a Cartan decomposition into diagonal operators {H\u0302i}I and shift ones {E\u0302\u03b1}A, one can write \u2126\u0302 \u2208 G/F as \u2126\u0302 = exp \u2211 \u03b1\u2208A(\u2126\u03b1E\u0302\u03b1 \u2212 \u2126\u2217\u03b1E\u0302\u2020\u03b1), and hence, from Eq.

Despite not admitting a Cartan decomposition, a lookalike expression defines coherent states also for the two algebras h4 and h6 (the well known bosonicCS and their squeezed version, respectively).\nWe will hereafter write g-CS to indicate coherent states relative to the specific algebra g.

Amongst the consequences of this fact, most relevant to this work is that it allows one to define a distance between quantum states in terms of the distance between probability distributions named after Monge [14, 15]. In fact, it is demonstrated [16] that the Monge distance between H|\u03c6\u3009(\u2126) and H|\u03c8\u3009(\u2126), is a legitimate distance between |\u03c6\u3009 and |\u03c8\u3009, that we will hereafter indicate as dM(|\u03c6\u3009 , |\u03c8\u3009), and simply dub Monge distance. Evaluating dM(|\u03c6\u3009 , |\u03c8\u3009) requires dealing with a transportation problem [17] which is most often too complex to be solved. However, the Monge distance bears properties that make its use very convenient when GCS are involved and the quantum-to-classical crossover is considered, as further commented upon in the next section and in Appendix A."

            "text": "LARGE-N LIMIT\nA formal description of how, and under which conditions, a physical system displays a behaviour that can be described by the laws of classical physics is provided by the so called large-N limit approach, developed in the framework of quantum field theory several decades ago [2, 18, 19]. Cornerstone of this approach is the fact that a macroscopic system, whose size is gauged by the number N mentioned in the Introduction, may or may not display a classical-like behaviour: the former is true if some conditions hold, which are given in terms of GCS and provide the details of the effective classical theory obtained in the N \u2192 \u221e limit [3, 20]. Amongst these conditions, relevant to this work are\nd\u00b5(\u2126) = cNdm(\u2126) , (4)\nwith dm(\u2126) a measure on M properly scaled, via the N - dependent positive constant cN , so as to make \u222b M dm(\u2126) independent of N itself, and\nlim N\u2192\u221e\nN |\u3008\u2126|\u2126\u2032\u3009|2 = \u03b4(\u2126\u2212 \u2126\u2032) , (5)\nfor any pair of GCS |\u2126\u3009 and |\u2126\u2032\u3009, meaning that a notion of distinguishability between GCS is recovered along the quantumto-classical crossover. In fact, it is demonstrated [16, 21] that when Eq. (5) holds, the Monge distance dM(|\u2126\u3009 , |\u2126\u2032\u3009) between GCS flows into the metric-induced distance d(\u2126,\u2126\u2032) between points onM. This reinforces the affinity between the algebraic quantum description with GCS and the geometrical classical one with representative points, establishing that if the distance between two representative points is large enough to be appreciated, then the GCS associated with those two points must become distinguishable in the large-N limit. It can also be demonstrated (see Ref. [21] and Appendix A for more details) that\ndM(|\u2126\u3009 , |\u2126\u2032\u3009) \u2264 d(\u2126,\u2126\u2032) , (6)\nimplying that the Monge distance cannot provide a precision in GCS discrimination higher than that granted by the metricinduced distance for classical states recognition. Finally, as Eq. (5) holds in the N \u2192 \u221e limit, there should exist a largeN twilight zone where a classical-like analysis of the system behaviour is possible (large N ), and yet some of its quantum features are retained (finite N ). This is the situation in which we are interested the most, that we propose to characterize as follows."

            "text": "Consider a system \u0393 with Hilbert space H and GCS {|\u2126\u3009}H; be M the related symplectic manifold. We ask ourselves: is the behaviour of \u0393 amenable to an effective classical-like description? In other words, can we experimentally determine the coordinates of a point in some phase-space that embody enough information on \u0393 to be considered representative of its state, in a classical sense? To get a positive answer we first require that \u0393 be in some GCS [33], based on the fact that GCS survive the classical limit as proper physical states, and then check if an effective discrimination procedure [22] for GCS can be designed. In fact, if we can tell that \u0393 is in a specific GCS |\u03a3\u3009, a classical-like description emerges from the one-to-one relation between the element |\u03a3\u3009 \u2208 H and the point \u03a3 in the symplectic manifoldM, now intended as a classical phase-space. Therefore, our program goes as follows: i) design a POVM for GCS discrimination, ii) analyze the conditions under which the corresponding measurement meets our demand for sharpness, iii) find a value Nt such that N > Nt ensures the above conditions are fulfilled.\ni) POVM for GCS discrimination: We introduce a tessellation ofM by choosing a separable set of regions Ii \u2208 M, i = 1, ...L, such that \u222ajIj = M and Ii \u2229 Ij 6=i = \u2205; we call these regions tiles. We establish that\n3\neach tile Ii is biunivocally associated to one possible resultmi of our gedanken experiment, and define the following effects\nE\u0302i = E\u0302(mi) := \u222b Ii d\u00b5(\u2126) |\u2126\u3009\u3008\u2126| , (7)\nwith |\u2126\u3009 the GCS of the system. As the index i = 1, ...L counts the distinguishable results that the instrument provides, a larger L implies a higher resolution of our instrument. It is easily checked that the above effects are positive semi-definite operators that sum up to the identity onH, and such that\nE\u0302(\u222ajmj) = \u222b \u222ajIj d\u00b5(\u2126) |\u2126\u3009\u3008\u2126| = \u2211 j E\u0302j ; (8)\ntherefore, they define a POVM, with the probability to get the result mi, when \u0393 is in a state |\u03c6\u3009, given by the Born rule p|\u03c6\u3009(mi) = Tr[E\u0302i |\u03c6\u3009\u3008\u03c6|]. When |\u03c6\u3009 is a GCS, say |\u03a3\u3009, the invariance of d\u00b5(\u2126) and the definition of GCS via Eq. (1) imply\np|\u03a3\u3009(mi) = Tr[E\u0302i |\u03a3\u3009\u3008\u03a3|] = \u222b Ii d\u00b5(\u2126)|\u3008\u03a3|\u2126\u3009|2 . (9)\nIf the representation of g is infinite-dimensional, the effectively accessed states of the system are assumed to belong to a finite-dimensional subspace H\u0304 \u2282 H, and the apparatus will be asked to explore just a compact portion M\u0304 of M. A properly normalized measure d\u00b5\u0304(\u2126) will ensure that\u222b M\u0304 d\u00b5\u0304 |\u2126\u3009\u3008\u2126| = IH\u0304. For the sake of simplicity we will hereafter assume thatM is compact. As GCS are not orthogonal, from Eq. (9) it follows that p|\u03a3\u3009(mi) > 0 for all mi and whatever the GCS |\u03a3\u3009: there-\nfore, the above POVM cannot provide a proper GCS discrimination. However, we can settle for an approximate discrimination of this type: we choose one point \u039bi in each tile Ii, thus establishing the following chain of biunivocal relations,\nmi \u2194 \u039bi \u2194 |\u039bi\u3009 , (10)\nand require p|\u039bj\u3009(mi) = \u03b4ij to guarantee perfect discrimination at least between GCS of the set {|\u039bi\u3009}, hereafter called sampled GCS. As for other GCS, we introduce the patch I\u0303i, made of Ii and its neighbouring tiles (see Fig. 1), and demand that a result mi informs us that \u0393 is in a GCS whose representative point surely belongs to I\u0303i. In order to obtain the above type of GCS discrimination we first accept to consider null any inner product whose modulus is less than a chosen (small) positive value (we will hereafter use the symbol \u223c for (in)equalities that only hold subject to this choice); a notion of -orthogonality follows, defined by |\u3008\u03a3|\u2126\u3009| \u2264 \u21d4 |\u03a3\u3009 and |\u2126\u3009 are -orthogonal, which carries the possibility to consider two GCS distinguishable if their respective Husimi functions are never simultaneously larger than 2. This can be illustrated, for instance, by plotting the sum of two Husimi functions, H|\u03a3\u3009(\u2126) + H|\u03a3\u2032\u3009(\u2126), and the plane marking the value 2 2, as done in Fig. 2 for different values of N : if the sum emerges from the plane in the form of two distinct peaks, the respective GCS |\u03a3\u3009 and |\u03a3\u2032\u3009 are distinguishable in the sense of the -orthogonality introduced above. After this choice, for each GCS |\u03a3\u3009 we define the region\nS |\u03a3\u3009 = {\u2126 \u2208M : |\u3008\u03a3|\u2126\u3009| > } (11)\nthat contains all the representative points of GCS that are not -orthogonal with |\u03a3\u3009.\nii) Conditions for a sharp enough GCS-discrimination We consider a GCS discrimination sharp enough to provide an acceptable classical-like description of \u0393 via the results of the POVM (7) if conditions\nS |\u039bi\u3009 \u2286 Ii , \u2200i (12)\nS |\u03a3\u3009 \u2286 I\u0303i , \u2200\u03a3 \u2208 Ii (13)\nhold. While the first condition makes sampled GCS distinguishable, the second one means |\u3008\u03a3|\u2126\u3009| ' 0 for \u2126 /\u2208 I\u0303i, i.e. p|\u03a3\u3009(mi) \u223c 0 if \u03a3 /\u2208 I\u0303i, thus giving the output mi the information content mentioned above.\n4 iii) Value of N ensuring that conditions (12-13) are fulfilled. Finding this value generally requires the analysis of geometrical properties that depend on M and can be very difficult to be dealt with. Therefore, we choose to replace conditions (12-13) with an algebraic inequality, faithful to their meaning but easier to study. To this aim, we remove the arbitrariness in the definition of the tiles Ii by introducing a parameter \u03b4 defined, for instance, as\n\u03b4 := min j { min \u2126\u2208\u2202Ij d(\u2126,\u039bj)} , (14)\nwhere \u2202Ij is the border of the j-th tile: in words, \u03b4 is the minimum value taken by the radius of the largest circle centered in \u039bj and fully contained in Ij , given the tessellation. As \u03b4 gauges the extension of the tiles, a smaller \u03b4 implies a larger L and hence a better resolution of our instrument: this gives the tiles a further dependence on \u03b4, which is why we will hereafter indicate them as I\u03b4i . Then we replace (12-13) with\nif \u03a3 \u2208 I\u03b4i then |\u3008\u03a3|\u2126\u3009| > \u21d2 dM(|\u2126\u3009 , |\u039bi\u3009) \u2264 \u03b4 + dM(|\u03a3\u3009 , |\u039bi\u3009) . (15)\nThe distinguishability between sampled GCS required by (12) is granted by (15) with \u03a3 = \u039bi. On the other hand, whether or not an exact match between (13) and (15) exists depends on the geometry of the problem, the tessellation chosen, and the definition of the parameter \u03b4. In particular, the latter can be taken different from Eq. (14) to translate (12-13) into (15) in a way that better corresponds to the specific problem and experimental apparatus one is considering (see Appendix B for more comments on this). We also underline that using the distance between points induced by the metric onM, instead of the Monge distance between quantum states in H, would be incorrect, as the geometrical distance between points on a manifold is generally unrelated to whatever distance between quantum states, even if only GCS are considered. However, the Monge distance has the advantage to carry the ordering relation (6), so that enforcing (15) with d rather than dM ensures that (15) itself is fulfilled. Consistently, using one or the other distance becomes equivalent as N \u2192 \u221e. This is seen, for instance, in Fig. 8 of Appendix A, where dM between two su(2)-GCS as a function of N [21] is compared with the value of the (constant) metric-induced distance between their respective representative points, as a function of N .\nFinally, as the region S |\u03a3\u3009 shrinks when N increases, according to Eq. (5) and as seen in Fig. 2, we expect that a finite, threshold value Nt( , \u03b4) exists, such that\nN > Nt( , \u03b4)\u21d2 condition (15) is fulfilled ; (16)\nthe dependence ofNt on and \u03b4 reminds us that it does not exist a critical size beyond which a system behaves according to the laws of classical physics: rather, it all depends on the goggles we wear, here designed by and \u03b4. However, if N > Nt the result of one single experiment, say mi, conveys a meaningful piece of information, namely that \u0393 is surely described by a GCS in I\u0303i and, with a fair degree of certainty (gauged by\nFIG. 3: A spin-ring made of a finite number of s = 1 2 distinguishable particles, each localized on one site of a circle; the operator shown in the center is an example of hamiltonian that commutes with the total spin of the ring.\nand \u03b4), by the sampled GCS |\u039bi\u3009 itself. In the language of classical physics the same holds, with GCS replaced by representative points in the system\u2019s phase-space. For the sake of clarity, in the next section we consider a specific case and show how to locate Nt( , \u03b4) explicitly."

            "text": "In this section we consider a composite magnetic system \u0393 with total spin (or angular) momentum fixed to J , due to some constraint upon the accessible quantum states of its N subsystems. The system can be made, for instance, by a number N of spin- 12 particles, each localized on a site of a ring (see Fig. 3) and interacting with its two nearest neighbours via a isotropic Heisenberg interaction, or anything else leading to a total hamiltonian that commutes with the total spin operator. The quantum theory that describes this system is defined by the Lie-algebra su(2), which is a vector space spanned by the set {J0, J1, J2}, with Lie brackets [Ji, Jj ] = i ijkJk, and Casimir J2 = J20 + J 2 1 + J 2 2 . Each irreducible representation of the algebra is labelled by an integer or half-integer number J = 12 (N \u2212 n), for some positive integer n \u2264 N , associated to the Casimir operator via J\u03022 = J(J + 1)I\u0302HJ , where HJ is the Hilbert space carrying the representation, with dimHJ = 2J + 1. The spectrum of J\u03020 is m = \u2212J,\u2212J + 1, ...J \u2212 1, J , and its eigenvectors, J\u03020 |J,m\u3009 = m |J,m\u3009, spanHJ .\nThe manifoldM introduced in Sec. II is the sphere S2, and\n5 choosing |R\u3009 = |J,m = \u2212J\u3009 in Eq. (2), a su(2)-CS reads\n|\u2126\u3009 = J\u2211\nm=\u2212J gm(\u2126) |J,m\u3009 (17)\nwhere \u2126 = \u03b82e \u2212i\u03c6 identifies a point on S2 via the polar coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u2208 [0, \u03c0]\u00d7 [0, 2\u03c0), and\ngm(\u2126) =\n\u221a( 2J\nm+ J\n) \u00d7\n\u00d7 ( cos \u03b8\n2\n)J+m( sin \u03b8\n2\n)J\u2212m ei(J\u2212m)\u03c6 .

(20)\nwith dm(\u2126) := sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6 the measure on S2. The metricinduced distance between any two points on the sphere is\nd(\u2126\u2032,\u2126\u2032\u2032) = arccos [cos(\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u2032) cos \u03b8\u2032 cos \u03b8\u2032\u2032 + sin \u03b8\u2032 sin \u03b8\u2032\u2032] . (21)\nBefore numerically simulating our gedanken experiment, we must estimate Nt, i.e. the value of N ensuring that the POVM described in Sec. IV satisfactorily discriminates the su(2)-CS of the system. This value depends neither on the state |\u03a3\u3009 nor on the specific tile it belongs; therefore, thanks to the rotational invariance of the metric and of the Husimi functions on S2, we can determine it by choosing |\u03a3\u3009 = |\u039bi\u3009 and \u039bi as the north pole. With this choice, the first line of condition (15) is certainly fulfilled and, from the second one, we obtain that the following implication must hold(\ncos \u03b8\n2\n)2J > \u21d2 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b4 . (22)\nThe value of N comes into play via the total momentum J = 1 2 (N \u2212 n), with 0 \u2264 n \u2264 N , so that condition (16) takes the form\nN > Nt = ln\nln[cos(\u03b4/2)] + n ; (23)\nthis is consistent with the fact that systems with a large magnetic moment (N 1 and n N ) are well described by classical magnetism , while big systems (N 1) with small magnetic moment (n \u2264 N ) retain their quantum properties, regardless of their macroscopicity. The dependence of Nt on and \u03b4 underlines that even if the system has a very large J and seems to behave classically when observed with a slightly unfocused pair of goggles, there always exist small enough\nvalues of \u03b4 and such that quantum-state indistinguishability cannot be circumvented, and a classical-like description is flimsy. It is worth mentioning that the functional dependence of Nt in Eq. (23), and particularly the appearance of cos(\u03b4/2), follows from the expression of the overlap between su(2)-CS, Eq. (19), i.e. from the algebra su(2) we are considering. Further comments on this point are made at the end of this section, where results obtained for different algebras are briefly reviewed.\nWe are now ready to describe the experiment. First we choose = 0.22 ( 2 \u223c 0.05). Then we consider a tessellation of S2 into L = 146 tiles, made of two polar caps of radius \u03c018 and 144 tiles defined by 9 parallels at latitude \u03b8` = \u03c02 + ` \u03c0 9 , ` = \u22124, ...4, and 18 meridians at longitude \u03c6m = m\u03c09 ,m = 0, ...17 (see the left panel of Fig. 4). According to (14), the parameter \u03b4 is the radius of the largest circle fully contained into the smallest tiles, i.e. those adjacent to the polar caps in our case, so that \u03b4 = arcsin(sin \u03c018 sin \u03c0 9 ) ' 0.06 (see the right panel of Fig. 4). Therefore, from Eq. (23) with n = 0, we get Nt = 3430. As for the sampled GCS, we notice that each tile can be identified by a single index i biunivocally related with the couple (`,m), and the representative points \u039bi can be chosen as \u039bi = ((4 + `)\u03c09 , (m+ 1 2 ) \u03c0 9 ). The tile I1 is adjacent to the equator (` = 0) with m = 2, so that \u039b1 = (49\u03c0, 5 18\u03c0) (the central red point on the spheres of Figs. 5-7). Refer to the Appendix for more details and comments upon the above choices.\nSuppose the quantum system under investigation is in the unknown GCS |\u03a3\u3009 that we want to determine. In order to test our POVM we set \u03a3 = (0.88, 0.94) (the red point in the upper right corner of tile #1 on the spheres of Figs. 5- 7), and see whether the POVM results allow one to identify the patch, I\u03031, to which it belongs. To this aim we first consider the sampled GCS, and check condition (12) taking 25 different results, mj , j = 1, 2...25, each associated to the j-th tile as shown in the spheres of Figs. 5-7, and evaluating the probability of obtaining each result if \u0393 is in the state |\u039b1\u3009, i.e.\np|\u039b1\u3009(mj) = \u222b I\u03b4j\u2229S |\u039b1\u3009 d\u00b5(\u2126)|\u3008\u039b1|\u2126\u3009|2 , (24)\n6\naccording to Eq. (9) with |\u3008\u039b1|\u2126\u3009|2 < 2 = 0.05 set equal to 0, and \u3008\u039b1|\u2126\u3009 from Eq. (19) (for more details see Appendix C). The obtained probability distributions, illustrated in the upper panels of Figs. 5-7 for N = 30, 300, and 3430 = Nt, show that the result is certainly m1 if N = Nt, while it can be different otherwise, meaning that N \u2265 Nt is indeed a sufficient condition for the POVM to discriminate the sampled GCS. The same analysis is done for the system in the (unknown, in principle) GCS |\u03a3\u3009, using the probability\np|\u03a3\u3009(mj) = \u222b I\u03b4j\u2229S |\u03a3\u3009 d\u00b5(\u2126)|\u3008\u03a3|\u2126\u3009|2 ; (25)\nThe probability distributions are shown in the lower panels of Figs. 5-7 for the same values of N as before. In this case condition (13) is fulfilled not only for N = Nt but also for N = 300 < Nt, as belonging to the patch I\u03031 is a much looser condition w.r.t. that of belonging to the specific tile I1. However, if we cannot associate with absolute certainty the result m1 to the sampled GCS \u039b1 there is no reason why that same result should not correspond to a GCS with representative point in the patch I\u03032, or in any other patch that contains I1. To this respect, we also underline that even if the probability distributions can tell to which specific tile the representative point \u03a3 belongs, as seen in some of the above figures, in order for the emerging description to be of genuinely classical\nnature, this information must be available after the result of one single experiment, taking aside the repetitions needed to deal with whatever experimental error. This is the reason why condition (12) must hold.\nTo summarize, the above example confirms that for N > Nt the POVM results provide us with enough information to relate the state |\u03a3\u3009 of the system with the sampled representative point \u039b1, with a systematic error controlled by the parameter \u03b4 that might bring such point into \u039bj with j = 2, 3...9. Evidently, a larger N can only improve the situation, while the experiment deteriorates as N is lowered.\nThe example presented in this Section can serve as a template for systems described by different algebras, for which\n7 Eqs. (19) and (21) must be replaced with the expressions proper to the specific algebra and geometry of the respective manifold. In particular, for pseudo-spin systems (su(1, 1) algebra and manifold the pseudo-sphere PS2) we obtain\nNt = \u2212 ln\n2k ln[cosh(\u03b4/2)] , (26)\nwhere k is the Bargmann index of the single pseudo-spin, and for bosonic systems (h4 and manifold the complex plane)\nNt = \u2212 1\n\u03b42 ln , (27)\nwhere different relations between the parameter N and the relevant coefficients of the algebra hold, analogous to N = 2(J \u2212 n) in the magnetic case presented above [3].\nNotice that the functional dependence of Nt on is always the same (direct proportionality to ln ), while different algebras bring different dependencies on \u03b4. This reflects the different nature and meaning of the two parameters, as further commented in the next section."

            "text": "In this work we have seen that a physical system, quantum by nature, can possibly be described in \u201dclassical words\u201d if the number N of elements that determines the global algebra defining its GCS is larger than a threshold value that depends on parameters of our choice. The \u201dclassical words\u201d are the tools of the Hamiltonian formalism, with the state of the system described by a representative point on a specific phase-space, and the possibility of getting information upon the state of the system via one single measurement, a possibility that is precluded to quantum mechanics. To this respect, referring to the example of Sec. V, our choice of showing the probability distributions in Figs. 5-7 is functional to a description that is ultimately quantum. However, if one knows \u03b4, chooses , determinesNt( , \u03b4), and checks thatN > Nt, then the single resultmi identifies the classical representative point of the system \u039bi with the usual systematic experimental error\ndue to the resolution of the measuring apparatus, here gauged by \u03b4. The entity of the probability that the actual representative point be different from \u039bi can be set arbitrarily small by reducing : this probability is the residual quantum signature that one can decide to ignore, as done with the probability that a human being passes through a wooden door. As for the precise definition and value of \u03b4, they depend on the experimental apparatus and can be difficult to obtain. Obviously, one can always choose a value for \u03b4 which is larger than the one that ideally translates conditions (12-13) into the implication (15): however, this may lead to an unnecessary overestimation of Nt. A thorough discussion of these aspects can be found in Appendix B.\nThe two small numbers \u03b4 and have an essential role in our picture: they are quantifiers of the available experimental resolution and of our willingness to neglect rare events, respectively, and should not be considered as expansion-parameters ruling the validity of some semiclassical approximation. In fact, our proposal is alternative to semiclassical approximations, and can also be used in a somehow opposite direction, namely to study if and how a system originally described by a classical theory can manifest more and more marked quantum traits as its size reduces for one reason or another. In this regard, work is in progress to use this approach to study how a Schwarzschild black hole, i.e. an object which is classically described by definition, can manifest increasingly evident quantum features as its size shrinks due to the emission of Hawking radiation [23]; we believe that a better understanding of this crossover can shed light upon the information paradox and its relation with the Page curve [24, 25], as well as on the way spacetime can arise in the fully algebraic setting of standard quantum mechanics [26]."

[32] The Lie algebra that defines a quantum theory is the one whose irreducible representation on the Hilbert space of the system that the theory describes contains the Hamiltonian and all the relevant observables of the system itself. [33] This is not necessarily the case, of course, but discussing if and why quantum states must be Coherent if they were to flow into well defined classical states is not the purpose of this work (see Refs. [2, 3] for an extensive analysis of the matter); to this respect, however, we underline that GCS form a closed set w.r.t. the action of any propagator of the theory, a fact that is sometimes expressed by the motto \u201donce a coherence state, always a coherent state\u201d: therefore, we only need to assume that \u0393 is in a GCS at some time."

            "heading": "Appendix A: Monge distance",
            "text": "In this Appendix we provide details on the Monge distance between probability distributions and its generalization to quantum states. The Monge distance was introduced in 1781 to model the most efficient strategy of transporting a pile of soil from one place to another [14]. Specifically, one can describe the position and shape of the initial and final soil configurations via the probability distributions q1 and q2, respectively. Let us assume these are defined in an open set O of a metric space (M, d) endowed with a normalized measure d\u00b5. Given that qi \u2265 0 and \u222b O qid\u00b5 = 1, one can recover the intuition behind the transport problem by defining Vi = {(x, y) \u2208 O\u00d7 R+ : 0 \u2264 y \u2264 qi(x)} (28) as the volume of the mound associated to qi. Then, any transport strategy for moving q1 to q2 is related to a continuous one-to-one function T , mapping O to itself and called plan. Moreover, it is required that these plans are volume preserving, i.e. \u222b A q1d\u00b5 = \u222b T\u22121(A) q2d\u00b5 , \u2200A \u2282M . (29) The Monge distance between probability distributions is defined as dM(q1, q2) = inf T {\u222b O d(x, T (x))q1(x)d\u00b5(x) } , (30) where the minimization is performed over the set of all plans. When it exists, the optimal plan that realizes the minimum in Eq. (30) is called Monge plan. For the pathological situations in which a Monge plan does not exist, L.V. Kantorovich introduced a weakened version of the Monge distance [15] called the Monge-Kantorovich distance; however, the Monge distance here discussed is sufficient for our scopes. When considering probability distributions defined on the real line equipped with the Euclidean distance, Eq. (30) becomes dM(q1, q2) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e |Q1(x)\u2212Q2(x)|dx , (31) where Qi are the cumulative distributions of qi [27]. Despite being specific to the one-dimensional case, when supplemented with symmetry arguments the above expression can be used to find the Monge distance for some two-dimensional\n9\nproblems. In general, though, finding an analytical expression for dM(q1, q2) without relying on numerical algorithms is most often an impossible task; a vast literature on computational approaches to the transport problem is available (see for instance Ref. [28]).\nThe Monge distance can be used to define a distance between quantum states [16, 21, 29]. Referring to the grouptheoretic construction of GCS presented in Sec. II, and recalling that the Husimi functions (3) are probability distributions on the GCS manifoldM, a distance between quantum states can be defined via\ndM(|\u03c6\u3009 , |\u03c8\u3009) \u2261 dM(H\u03c6, H\u03c8) , (32)\nwhere |\u03c6\u3009 , |\u03c8\u3009 \u2208 H and the distance on the r.h.s. is obtained via Eq. (30) by selectingM and the metric-induced distance for the metric space (M, d). Other definitions of quantum distances via the transport problem have been recently proposed [30, 31], but dM has some particularly useful properties. First, the inequality (6) holds (with the equality certainly obtained as N \u2192\u221e) which provides a convenient upper bound to the Monge distance, whenever it is hard to be evaluated. Second, from the translation invariance of the measure and metric-induced distance onM it follows that the Monge distance between quantum states is invariant under the action of the elements of the group G that defines the quantum theory.\nThe closed form of the Monge distance between any two su(2)-CS is obtained in Ref. [21]. Referring to the discussion in Sec. V, and thanks to the rotational invariance of the problem, the Monge distance between any two su(2)-CS only depends on the azimuthal coordinate, the angle \u03b8, of the point corresponding to one of them, in a polar reference system where the point corresponding to the other is the north pole, and it is\ndM(J ; \u03b8) = \u03c0 sin\n( \u03b8\n2\n) WJ [ sin2 ( \u03b8\n2\n)] , (33)\nwhere\nWJ(x) = 2J + 1\n4J+1 \u2211 0\u2264u,v u+v=J SJ(u, v)A(u, v)x u(1\u2212 x)v , (34)\nwith\nSJ(u, v) = (2J)!\n(2J \u2212 2(u+ v)\u2212 1)!u!v!(u+ v + 1)!4u+v ,\n(35) and\nA(u, v) = \u221e\u2211 s=v+1\n( 2s s ) (u+ s+ 1)4s . (36)\nThe large-N limit of Eq. (33) is\nlim J\u2192\u221e dM(J ; \u03b8) = \u03b8 . (37)\nIn Fig. 8 we show dM(J ;\u03c0/3), as numerically obtained after Eq. (33) for J \u2208 [1, 20], and compare it with the metricinduced distance, that does not depend on J ."

V is the case k = 4 of a tessellation T (k) defined by 2k+1 parallels and 2(2k+1) meridians, according to parallels : \u03b8l = \u03c0 2 + l \u03c0 2k + 1 l = \u2212k, ..., k meridians : \u03c6m = m \u03c0\n2k + 1 m = 0, ..., 2(2k + 1)\n(38)\nwhere the meridians are considered only for \u03b8 \u2208 [\u03b8\u2212k, \u03b8k]. The number of tiles is L = 2(4k2 + 2k + 1), including the two polar caps of radius \u03c0/(4k + 2). In each tile, the point \u039bi = (\u03b8\u039bi , \u03c6\u039bi) corresponding to the sampled GCS |\u039bi\u3009 is the center of the largest circle inscribed in the tile itself. Overall, these are the two poles and the points with coordinates (\u03c02 +\n10\n(2l \u2212 1)\u22062 , (2m + 1) \u2206 2 ), with \u2206 = \u03c0/(2k + 1), l = \u2212k + 1, ..., k, and m = 0, ..., 2(2k + 1) \u2212 1. For a generic point \u03a3 = (\u03b8\u03a3, \u03c6\u03a3) on the tile identified by the pair (l,m), one can write \u03b8\u03a3 = \u03c02 + (l \u2212 y)\u2206, \u03c6\u03a3 = (m + x)\u2206, with (y, x) \u2208 [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1]. The parameter \u03b4, defined by Eq. (14) as the radius of the largest circle inscribed in the smallest tiles (those identified by l = \u2212k + 1 or l = k), is\n\u03b4 = arcsin ( sin ( \u2206\n2\n) sin \u2206 ) . (39)\nThe connection between the geometric conditions Eqs. (12- 13) and the algebraic inequality in (15), with \u03b4 defined in (14), follows from the specific setting one is considering. In fact, whether or not an exact match exists depends on the geometry of the problem, the tessellation chosen, and the definition of the parameter \u03b4, that can be modified in order to better fit the specific problem and the related experimental apparatus. Consider for instance a tessellation T@(4), sibling of T (4), defined by parallels and shifted chunks of meridians, such that the radius of the largest circle inscribed in each tile is \u03c0/18 and the points corresponding to the sampled GCS are the centers of such circles. The left panel of Fig. 9 shows T@(4) and the region S |\u039bi\u3009 defined by Eq. (11) at various latitudes, for = 0.22 and N = 400 > Nt = 398, from Eq. (23). As expected, being N above threshold, the condition ensuring that sampled GCS are distinguishable, i.e. condition (12), is fulfilled, as seen in the left panel of Fig. 9. On the other hand, there is no patch I\u0303i that fully contains S |\u03a3\u3009 for |\u03a3\u3009 with representative point the red dot in the right panel of Fig. 9. For this specific GCS, in fact, the parameter \u03b4, as defined by Eq. (14) and represented by the length of the purple line on the right panel of Fig. 9, should be replaced by the length \u03b4\u2032 of the green line. This done, Eq. (23) provides N \u2032t = 3285 Nt = 398, confirming that we are indeed working below threshold. Notice that changing the red point, for instance bringing it closer to the upper right corner of the corresponding tile, the value of N \u2032t can become even greater. In fact, to obtain a value of Nt that works for any point given the specific tessellation, one should replace Eqs. (14) and (15) with\n\u03b4 := min i\n[ min\n\u2126\u2208\u2202Ii d(\u2126,\u039bi) , min \u2126\u2208\u2202Ii , \u2126\u0303\u2208\u2202I\u0303i d(\u2126, \u2126\u0303)\n] (40)\nand\n|\u3008\u2126|\u03a3\u3009| > \u21d2 dM(|\u2126\u3009 , |\u03a3\u3009) \u2264 \u03b4 \u2200\u2126,\u03a3 \u2208 S2 (41)"
