    "abstractText": "Participants who had high frequencies of physical activities before or during the COVID-19 outbreak exhibited higher levels of life satisfaction. Participants who increased their sitting time during the pandemic or kept sitting for more than eight hours before and during the pandemic reported worse mental health than those who maintained less sedentary behavior. Besides, participants who used the Internet for information seeking, communication, and entertainment more frequently reported better mental health and life satisfaction. In contrast, there was a positive association between commercial use of the Internet and symptoms of mental disorders.",

            "text": "Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in China\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted many societies and economies. The total confirmed infection cases had reached over 483 million, and the death toll hit more than 6.1 million by March 30, 2022 [1]. To control the spreading of COVID-19, governments worldwide have implemented various restriction measures ranging from social distancing to societal shutdown [2]. While these measures are critical in containing the outbreak, they may compromise individuals\u2019 mental health and health activities [2, 3].\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province,\nChina, in December 2019. Authorities put Wuhan and 16 neighboring cities in Hubei under lockdown starting January 23, 2020. During the following weeks, COVID-19 cases increased rapidly and overwhelmed the health care system, especially in Wuhan. The situation improved when the Chinese government built massive temporary medical facilities to house COVID patients and transferred a large number of medical personnel to Hubei. The lockdowns were relaxed since March 23, 2020, and on April 8, 2020, the lockdown in Wuhan (the hardest-hit city in China) was officially lifted. Given the unprecedented social distancing measures, numerous studies have reported a high prevalence of mental health problems among Chinese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [4\u20136]. However, most prior studies focused on sociodemographic backgrounds, risk perceptions, and attitudes toward COVID-19 as risk factors for psychological distress [7, 8]. Limited studies have investigated the effect of pandemicrelated behavioral changes on population mental health.\nMental health consequences of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and online activities\nNumerous studies have shown that the COVID-19-related restriction measures disrupted daily routines and impacted lifestyle activities, including participation in sports and physical activity (PA) [9, 10]. The decline in PA was accompanied by increased sedentary (sitting) behavior [11]. Given the consistent benefits of regular PA for mental health [12\u201314], reductions in PA are likely to exacerbate COVID-19-fueled psychological distress. A review of 21 studies about the effect of PA on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that people who performed PA regularly with high volume and frequency and kept the PA routines stable would experience fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression [15].\nAdditionally, accumulating evidence has revealed that, independent of PA levels, sedentary\nbehavior is negatively associated with mental health [16, 17]. Several longitudinal investigations have shown that self-reported sedentary time predicts future mental health and wellbeing [18, 19]. A longitudinal study of populations in France and Switzerland found that sedentary behavior increased during the lockdown period of COVID-19, which was associated with poorer physical health, mental health, and subjective vitality [20]. Increasing sitting time during the COVID-19 pandemic may be a risk factor for mental health and life satisfaction.\nMoreover, COVID-19-related measures, such as closing down schools, workplaces, and\nentertainment outlets coupled with self-quarantine, have led to an unprecedented level of Internet and digital technology use. People move almost every aspect of their daily activities to cyberspace at an accelerating speed, as a \u201cnew normal\u201d in the COVID-19 era. However, it remains unclear whether and how Internet usage would exacerbate or alleviate COVID19-fueled psychological distress. On the one hand, the Internet could enhance mental health by providing access to the latest information and enabling people to work, study, and shop\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269237 June 21, 2022 2 / 14\nmeet the criteria for access to confidential data.

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nonline that regularizes their routines during quarantines. On the other hand, excessive engagement in specific online activities such as gambling, gaming, social media use, and shopping may result in severe problems and elevate the risk of disordered or addictive use of the Internet [21, 22]. Given the mixed evidence regarding the effects of Internet usage on mental health, more studies are warranted to investigate the impact of Internet usage on mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo date, limited studies have examined how changes in PA, sedentary behavior, and online\nbehavior relate to mental health and quality of life among the Chinese population during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study of 4,898 adolescents in China showed that higher PA levels were significantly related to lower negative mood scores and higher positive mood scores during the COVID-19 pandemic [23]. More engagement in physical activities was also associated with reduced anxiety and depression among Chinese college students after adjusting for confounding demographic factors [24, 25]. While providing important insights, these studies often focused on subpopulations (e.g., adolescents, college students), and thus their findings cannot be generalized to the general population. A study of the Chinese adult population found that compared with that before the lockdown, their time engaged in daily PA decreased and sedentary time increased, and PA is positively associated with life satisfaction [26]. However, the authors did not examine the effect of COVID-19-induced behavioral changes on adverse mental health outcomes. Although some studies have found that PA participation was positively associated with mental health among the Chinese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [27, 28], they did not specifically examine how the changes in PA and sitting time before and during the COVID-19 pandemic may affect mental health. Moreover, virtually no research has investigated how different types of online behavior during the pandemic may affect the Chinese population\u2019s psychological wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The data collection was carried out between March 23, 2020, and April 9, 2020, while Hubei\u2019s lockdowns were gradually eased. Such data creates a unique opportunity for us to investigate Hubei residents\u2019 behavioral changes and psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. The findings of this study may improve our understanding and inform public health policies regarding the pattern and consequences of behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that (1) the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with changes in PA and sedentary behavior; (2) a decrease in PA may be negatively associated with mental health and life satisfaction; (3) an increase in sedentary behavior may have a negative effect on mental health and life satisfaction; and (4) Internet use may be positively associated with mental wellbeing and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we examined the impact of different types of Internet use, including information seeking, work/study, buying products, entertainment, reading/online learning, communication, and investment/financial management."

The survey was conducted between March 23, 2020, and April 9, 2020. Authorities imposed a strict lockdown policy for cities in Hubei since January 23, 2020, and started to ease the lockdown since March 23, 2020, with the lockdown in Wuhan officially lifted on April 8, 2020.\nThe survey targeted all the residents aged between 18 and 80 in the urban and rural areas of\nHubei. It was a combined online and phone survey. The online survey was conducted on a professional survey platform in China. The platform sent a notification to respondents in their sample bank with a link to allow access to the questionnaire. Only Hubei residents (with IP address locations in Hubei) could answer the questionnaire. No incentives were provided to the participants. A supplemented phone survey was carried out by trained research assistants to reach populations with limited access to the Internet (e.g., aged over 65, rural population). There were minimal differences between the two modes of data collection. Our research staff was asked not to provide any additional information but simply read the questions to the participants. Participants who did the online survey provided written consent. Participants who answered the questions via phone gave oral consent, and the interviewer signed a form pledging that he/she had gone through the proper procedures to obtain the verbal informed consent of the participant. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Chinese Academy of Social Science, and all procedures were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. In total, 2355 participants completed the online or phone surveys. After deleting cases with at least one missing value, the final sample included 2145 respondents, of which 1944 (90.63%) completed the online survey, and 201 (9.37%) completed the phone survey."

            "text": "Symptoms of mental disorders were measured by the 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire scale (CHQ-12), which is widely used for screening non-psychotic mental health problems in the general population. Developed by Cheng and Williams (1986), CHQ was adapted from the General Health Questionnaire [29] with the inclusion of culturally relevant items in Chinese societies. CHQ-12 has been validated in the general population in mainland China [30, 31], Taiwan [32, 33], and Chinese people in foreign countries [34, 35]. Ten items of CHQ-12 were negatively worded (e.g., \u201cBeen suffering from headache or pressure in your head\u201d) and two items were positively worded (e.g., \u201cHave you been getting along well with your family or friends recently?\u201d). The responses for all items ranged from 0 = \u201cnot at all\u201d to 3 = \u201cvery often.\u201d The responses for positive ones were reversely coded so that higher values indicated higher levels of mental disorder. The internal validity of the scale was good (Chronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.78). In this study, the cut-off point against the diagnosis of non-psychotic disorders was 13/14. About 32.07% of the participants scored greater than or equal to 14 and could be regarded as having symptoms consistent with potential mental disorders.\nLife satisfaction was assessed by the question, \u201cIn general, how satisfied are you with your life?\u201d with a 5-point scale from 1 = \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d to 5 = \u201cvery satisfied.\u201d Many studies and large-scale surveys have used such a single-item life satisfaction measure [36, 37]. Prior research has confirmed the reliability of this single-item measure of life satisfaction by showing that it performed very similarly compared to the multiple-item Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and correlated with external variables (e.g., health and affect) to a similar degree [38, 39].\nPhysical activity. Participants reported the frequency of doing moderate-to-vigorous\nphysical activity (MVPA) in 2019 and in the past month, followed by a brief explanation and\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269237 June 21, 2022 4 / 14\nsome examples of MVPA. MVPA refers to exercises such as running, playing ball, swimming, dancing, brisk walking, etc., for\ufffd10 minutes, which cause breathing and heart rate to increase. The response categories ranged from \u201cnever\u201d to \u201cevery day.\u201d Exercise training guidelines for a quarantine situation due to COVID-19 suggested that healthy or asymptomatic persons should do aerobic exercises for at least three sessions per week (four or five seem optimal) [40]. Participants were categorized as \u201cmaintaining high PA\u201d if they did PA> two times a week, as \u201cdecreased PA\u201d if they did PA for > two times a week before the COVID-19 pandemic but did not do so afterward, as \u201cincreased PA\u201d if they increased PA to> two times a week during the pandemic, and as \u201cmaintaining low PA\u201d if they did PA for less than two times a week before and during the pandemic.\nSitting time. Participants reported average daily time spent sitting before (i.e., in early\nJanuary 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies suggested that the association of daily sitting time and most long-term health outcomes is not linear, with a weekday sitting time below 8 hours/day associated with better perceived mental health and quality of life [41]. Participants were then classified as \u201cmaintaining low sitting time\u201d if they reported \ufffd8h/day of sitting at both time points, as \u201cincreasing sitting time\u201d if they reported\ufffd 8h/day of sitting before the pandemic but reported> 8h/day of sitting after the pandemic, as \u201cdecreasing sitting time\u201d if they reported> 8h/day of sitting before the pandemic but reported\ufffd 8h/day of sitting after the pandemic, and as \u201cmaintaining high sitting time\u201d if they reported > 8h/day of sitting at both time points.\nOnline behavior. Seven main and conceptually different types of Internet uses were\nassessed, including general information seeking; work; buying products (e.g., groceries); entertainment (e.g., playing online games, watching videos, listening to music); reading books/ online class; communication with family and friends via online communication tools (e.g., WeChat); and investment and financial management. The responses ranged from 0 = \u201cnever\u201d to 4 = \u201ceveryday\u201d. Higher values indicated a higher frequency of using the Internet for the corresponding activity.\nIn addition, a series of sociodemographic variables were measured, including age (continu-\nous), sex (male vs. female), education (middle school or below, high school, college or above), occupation (managerial/professional position, manual/service/part-time worker, or other), China Communist Party membership (Party member vs. non-Party member), monthly personal income (from no income to>8000 yuan), area (rural vs. urban), city (Wuhan vs. nonWuhan)."

Considering the variable of potential mental disorder was binary, we fit multiple logistic regression models to study the associations between changes in sitting time and PA during the COVID-19 pandemic and online behavior with symptoms of potential mental disorders. For the outcome variable of life satisfaction, we used OLS regression models to examine the effect of sedentary activity, PA, and online behavior after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Variance inflation factors (VIFs) of the independent variables were estimated to check whether multicollinearity exists in the models. All the VIFs were below 2, suggesting that multicollinearity was not a significant concern."

Compared\nto the pre-COVID-19 period, about 4.66% of participants increased their sitting time, and approximately 15.10% reduced their PA during the pandemic.

PA could be associated with life satisfaction through fitness- and health-related adaptations that enhance physical and mental health. PA may also have a revitalizing effect that strengthens self-control and supports goal pursuits [45, 46]. Considering we live in times of great psychological and emotional fragility, it is even more essential to promote PA that may help people adapt to the crisis and gain more life satisfaction. Our findings suggest that those who have low frequencies of PA during COVID-19 social distancing may need to be targeted with support for their quality of life. Policymakers and stakeholders should develop health education and communication that emphasize PA to improve life satisfaction during an infectious disease outbreak. As people have limited opportunities for doing PA outside their home during social distancing, future PA intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL) during a pandemic may adopt information and communications technology (ICT) solutions, such as home-based exercise games and fitness apps.\nAdditionally, our findings indicated that the overall time spent in sedentary behavior is pos-\nitively associated with symptoms of mental disorders. Sedentary behavior could be associated with mental disorders via several possible pathways. For example, screen-based sedentary behaviors (e.g., TV viewing) are likely to induce addiction [47], internalizing symptoms [48], and low sleeping quality [49], potentially leading to heightened levels of mental distress. Further, engaging in sedentary behaviors may displace time spent in other activities such as household or work-related responsibilities or PA, which may be effective coping strategies for symptoms of mental disorders [50]. It is worth noting that specific sedentary behaviors may contribute to mental health in different ways. For example, a study found that specific screenbased recreation was associated with higher self-esteem among Australian adolescents in lowincome communities [51]. Thus, future studies may investigate associations between different types of sedentary behavior and mental health.\nOur findings showed that various Internet use types had different associations with mental\nhealth and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic among Hubei residents. To start, online information-seeking behavior was associated with a lower likelihood of mental disorders and increased life satisfaction. Such findings seemed inconsistent with other studies showing that exposure to COVID-19-related information may increase psychological distress [52, 53]. The discrepancy between our study and others may be that we measured the general information-seeking behavior rather than COVID-19 specific information seeking. Future studies may further investigate whether information-seeking behavior in general and about COVID19 has differential effects on psychological wellbeing.\nTable 3.

Considering offline interactions were restricted by physical distancing and stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, online contact with friends and family may increase emotional support, and decrease loneliness and social isolation, which leads to lower symptoms of mental disorders and improved life satisfaction. Furthermore, our results have shown that online entertainment can reduce symptoms consistent with potential mental disorders. Using the Internet to relax may be a positive coping strategy to alleviate feelings of stress and isolation [56]. Similarly, working and learning remotely during the pandemic may keep people connected with their co-workers and classmates, despite physical isolation, and thus were positively associated with life satisfaction. Using the Internet for work and study may also help regularize daily routines, which is essential for buffering the adverse impact of stress exposure during a crisis [57].\nWhile respondents who used the Internet for information seeking, communication, study/\nwork, reading books, and entertainment reported better mental health and life satisfaction, the commercial use of the Internet (e.g., shopping, investment) seemed to increase mental distress. We conjecture that the economic downturn and uncertainty caused by the pandemic may be why people who were involved in more online economic activities suffered more distress. Previous studies also found that online shopping may be a negative coping strategy for stress and was associated with increased symptoms of mental disorders [58, 59]. While online purchases were the dominant way for people to get groceries due to social distancing and stay-at-home orders, scholars have suggested setting a specific time and financial limits for online shopping to reduce the risk of disordered or addictive use [60].\nDespite the significant findings, this study is not without limitations. First, due to the cross-\nsectional design employed in the present study, it cannot ascertain whether mental health problems lead to lower PA levels or whether lower levels of PA lead to mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to infer the direction of the association. Second, our samples are not representative since the study was mainly conducted online. However, considering in-person surveys would not be appropriate or possible during the COVID-19 pandemic, online surveys are arguably the most feasible way to collect data in a timely matter. We also supplemented the online survey with a telephone survey to reach groups with limited access to the Internet. Future studies may try various sampling methods to gain a population-based representative sample. Third, participants were asked to self-report their PA level, thus introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Moreover, we asked participants to retrospectively report their physical activity and sitting time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be subject to recall bias due to inaccurate memory. Future studies may use objective or direct measures of physical activity to increase precision and validate the self-report measures. Lastly, due to the online survey\u2019s length limitation, we only measured the PA frequency and the total amount of sedentary behavior during the pandemic. Future studies may further specify the level and type of PA and sedentary behavior and their relationship with mental health and life satisfaction."
