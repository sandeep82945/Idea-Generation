    "abstractText": "Against the backdrop of China\u2019s current dual-circulation paradigm, consumers have experienced the transition of their demands for products from price-driven needs to brand-driven needs. On the one hand, improving the value of consumer experience during brand building can enhance the exchanges and interactions between brands and consumers, facilitating the co-creation of value. On the other hand, the improvement of consumer experience can continuously strengthen the internal power of the construction of enterprise brand elements, and promote consumer-brand identity so as to constantly improve consumer purchase intention. In this study, we have taken consumers from the B2Cmarket as the survey group while innovatively studying the impact imposed by brand elements on the purchase intention of consumers based on the experience value. In addition, we have established the theoretical framework of brand elements\u2014experience value\u2014consumers\u2019 purchase intention based on our analysis of the relationship between the aforementioned three factors. Through empirical research, we have elaborated on whether brand elements can improve consumers\u2019 purchase intention and whether the experience value can play an intermediary role. The research findings indicate that (1) the three dimensions of brand elements, namely, brand personality, brand value, and brand culture, can impose a significant positive impact on the purchase intention of consumers and experience value; (2) the specific parts of the experience value, namely, functional value, emotional value, social value, and service value, can impose a significant positive impact on the purchase intention of consumers; and (3) experience value can play an intermediary effect to some extent while brand elements influence the purchase intention of consumers.",

On the one hand, improving the value of consumer experience\nduring brand building can enhance the exchanges and interactions between brands and\nconsumers, facilitating the co-creation of value. On the other hand, the improvement of\nconsumer experience can continuously strengthen the internal power of the construction\nof enterprise brand elements, and promote consumer-brand identity so as to constantly\nimprove consumer purchase intention. In this study, we have taken consumers from the\nB2Cmarket as the survey group while innovatively studying the impact imposed by brand\nelements on the purchase intention of consumers based on the experience value. In\naddition, we have established the theoretical framework of brand elements\u2014experience\nvalue\u2014consumers\u2019 purchase intention based on our analysis of the relationship between\nthe aforementioned three factors. Through empirical research, we have elaborated on\nwhether brand elements can improve consumers\u2019 purchase intention and whether the\nexperience value can play an intermediary role. The research findings indicate that (1) the\nthree dimensions of brand elements, namely, brand personality, brand value, and brand\nculture, can impose a significant positive impact on the purchase intention of consumers\nand experience value; (2) the specific parts of the experience value, namely, functional\nvalue, emotional value, social value, and service value, can impose a significant positive\nimpact on the purchase intention of consumers; and (3) experience value can play an\nintermediary effect to some extent while brand elements influence the purchase intention\nof consumers.\nKeywords: brand elements, experience value, consumer purchase intention, intermediary variable, B2C\nINTRODUCTION\nAs early as the 1960s, the American Marketing Association (AMA) proposed the definition of a brand, indicating that it is a name, proper noun, mark or symbol, or their combination, based on which most scholars extend from different fields and perspectives. More representative is the study by Aaker (1998) that pointed out that the brand is the consumers\u2019 overall perception and\nfeeling of the products and services provided by the merchants, which is not only closely related to the characteristics of the product itself but also related to the enterprise itself, employee behavior, cultural concept, and consumers\u2019 personal preferences. The connotation of the brand has been deepened and expanded, leading to the concept of brand elements. By building the brand pyramid model, Harris and de Chernatony (2001) revealed that the components of the brand include five aspects: characteristics, interests, emotional return, values, and personality quality, which reflect the internal nature of the brand. Kotler et al. (2009), through the actual case research, pointed out that the overall brand components include brand characteristics, brand interests, brand personality, brand object, brand value, and brand culture. Wu and Zhou (2020) divided the brand image of an e-commerce platform into three dimensions: brand performance, brand personality, and corporate image of the e-commerce platform.\nKotler et al. (2009) pointed out that in the Internet era, the market has become increasingly open and networked, whereas the asymmetry in the information grasped by buyers and sellers has gradually diminished. Moreover, customers have experienced the transition of their needs for products from price-driven demands to quality and brand-driven ones, and they tend to opt for branded products, which has become the trend for the development of consumption, namely, consumption upgrading. In the process of brand factor construction, the trend of consumption upgrading leads to the improvement of customers\u2019 overall awareness of the brand. Abbott (1956) believed that what consumers really expect is not the product, but to get the experience in the process of consumer products. This experience is the customer\u2019s subject perception and value of everything experienced through the whole consumption process (Gan, 2019). It can be seen that the brand elements are closely related to the connotation of customer experience, and it can even be said that the brand is an experience of consumers.\nIn the Internet era, customer experience will spread to the outside at a geometric scale through modern marketing environments, such as the Internet, thus affecting others\u2019 consumption decisions and production or service performance (Tong et al., 2020). Experience marketing emerged at the moment. Compared with traditional marketing methods, experience marketing can improve brand value and customer loyalty by improving customers\u2019 experience during consumption (Yang, 2015). Experience marketing encourages consumers to use and feel the products and pays attention to interactive communication with consumers (Wang et al., 2021a). When customers get the consumer experience, they usually share this experience with others, thus creating product experience value, covering a range of internal and external experience value, such as functional value, emotional value, and social value (Tynan and McKechnie, 2009; Chen and Zhu, 2019; Li, 2019).\nTherefore, this study believes that by shaping the perfect experience for consumers, brands can encourage consumers to take the initiative to pay a high premium and stay in the hearts of consumers in the way of sensory impressions, which can stimulate consumer purchase intention. In turn, improving the value of consumer experience can continuously strengthen the internal power of enterprise brand element construction, so it becomes more and\nmore important to build a brand with the help of the consumer experience.\nThrough literature combing, a majority of the existing research has focused on the impact of a brand single element on consumer purchase intention (Chen et al., 2020a; Zhuang et al., 2021). As Sirgy and Su (2000) noted that the brand will have an impact on the decision-making of consumption behavior, including product preference and purchase intention. Zhu et al. (2015) proved that brand communication has a predictive effect on consumer purchase intention. Zhou et al. (2020) explored the influence of individual subjective status on the purchase intention of \u201cservant\u201d and \u201cpartner\u201d anthropomorphic brands from the perspective of brand image. Baumert and de Obesso (2021) indicated that brand age has a statistically significant impact on consumer price setting. \u00c7avus\u0327oglu et al. (2021) examined the impact of brand image and brand awareness on perceived price and purchase intention. Therefore, it is not sufficient to study its influence on consumers\u2019 intention to buy from the overall perspective of brand elements.\nSince the purchase process of consumers is a complex psychological activity, this study innovatively proposes that the brand should be regarded as a multi-level whole, and the composition of the brand and the influence mechanism of consumers from the overall perspective of consumer purchase intention. Especially, in the consumer experience scene, how can the brand elements ultimately affect the consumer purchase intention by affecting the value of the consumer experience? That is, will the experience value play a certain intermediary role between the brand elements and consumer purchase intention?\nThis study established the theoretical framework of \u201cbrand elements\u2014experience value\u2014consumers\u2019 purchase intention\u201d. At the same time, different industries and brands may have different influences on consumers in brand elements, experience value perception, and purchase intention, so this study considers convenience, purchase, special products, and non-desire as control variables. Through empirical research, the study explores whether the improvement of brand elements can improve consumer purchase intention and whether the experience value can play an intermediary role in the two relationships. Finally, combined with the research conclusion, it is suggested that enterprise brand marketing should promote their purchase intention from the perspective of enhancing the value of the consumer experience."

            "text": "The elements are the basic units of the constituent system, and the brand elements are the units contained by the brand. Generally speaking, a brand is composed of multiple elements. By combing the relevant literature, it is found that the brand elements mainly have three types, namely, dominant elements, recessive elements, and comprehensive elements (Huang, 2016; Shen et al., 2016b; Feng et al., 2017).\nThe dominant element of a brand is a tangible external performance of the brand, focusing on the sensory level of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 873041\nconsumers (Gao et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021). The most representative figures are Park et al. (1991), who noted that the basic function of brand elements is to distinguish between ownership, including external elements, such as the name, image representation, advertising language, and packaging. Brand recessive elements are the performance of the internal attributes of the brand, such as cultural connotation, spiritual symbol, etc. Harris and de Chernatony (2001) revealed that the components of the brand include characteristics, interests, emotional returns, values, and personality quality, which are five aspects that reflect the internal essence of the brand. Kotler et al. (2009) pointed out the five aspects from the perspective of comprehensive elements, including brand characteristics, brand interests, brand personality, brand object, brand value, and brand culture. Li (2015) believed that the brand is generally composed of five basic elements, which include brand name, brand logo, brand concept, brand connotation, and brand objectives. Liu et al. (2016) distinguished brand elements more carefully. In the face of digital customized brands, she has established four elements, a total of 15 small elements. Zhao and Guo (2019) believed that the elements of the brand are divided into three categories: brand positioning, brand culture, and brand image. B\u00fcy\u00fckdag and Kitapci (2021) believed that the brand is influenced by elements, such as brand lifestyle consistency, brand identity, function, and social and emotional values.\nThrough the above literature, this study believes that the scholars proposed brand elements classification integration. Based on consumers\u2019 overall cognition of the brand, the dominant elements and recessive elements can be combined. On the basis of the overall brand division method of Kotler et al. (2009), we will guide enterprises to carry out more effective brand management from the perspective of comprehensive elements. A brand character includes brand characteristics, positioning, lifestyle, interests, image, characteristics, objectives, etc. Brand value includes brand interests, packaging, values, function, society, emotion, etc. Brand culture includes the brand name, image, positioning, identification, concept, connotation, etc. This study finally selects the three dimensions of brand character, brand value, and brand culture to constitute the brand elements, among which the brand character is the external embodiment of the brand personality; the brand value is the interests and functions transmitted by the brand to consumers, and the brand culture is the essential embodiment of the profound connotation of the brand.\nExperience Value Dimension Composition"

            "text": "With the arrival of the experience economy, the experience value has received widespread attention and research. Scholars\u2019 understanding of this concept is also deepening. Among them, the representative is the value co-creation theory based on customer needs. The customer experience value is the customer\u2019s cognition and evaluation of the degree to which their own needs are met (Butz and Goodstein, 1996; Cheng, 2007), which is the customer\u2019s diversified perception of the brand in the consumption process. This reflects the value demands\nof customers in the emotional, social, relationship, and other different aspects (Xu et al., 2015). The experience value is the relative psychological state and feedback of the product or service (Woodruff, 1997). Mathwick et al. (2001) believed that customers should get more happiness and emotional demands during the experience, which can not only affect their shopping goals but also improve the benefits of shopping. By creating self-perception priority, efficiency priority, and interactive priority experience scenarios, merchants have an impact on customers\u2019 psychological possession and control psychology and then affect customer value experience (Gao, 2021).\nIn order to quantify the above concept of experience value, scholars build the measurement dimensions of experience value from different perspectives.\nMultidimensional classification method. Sheth et al. (1991) proposed that the experience value felt by customers includes functional value, social value, emotional value, cognitive value, and situational value. Hua et al. (2020) believed that the consumer level experience includes six dimensions: service improvement, social contact, psychological harvest, spiritual leisure, sharing, symbiosis, and altruistic service.\nIntrospection, association, and hierarchical division (Zhang and You, 2009). Based on the psychological theory, introspection divides consumer perception into perception challenges (Massimini and Carli, 1988). Association studies the relationship between customers and consumer scenarios from an internal or external, active, or passive perspective (Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982). The interaction between consumers and sellers affects the value of the experience (Pi and Liu, 2009). Mathwick et al. (2001) put forward four value dimensions: customer investment remuneration, service superiority, beauty, and interest. The hierarchical division makes experience value correspond to the five levels of physiological, safety, belonging, respect, and self-realization. Gentile et al. (2007) and Du and Fan (2007) divided the experience value into six dimensions: practicality, feeling, emotion, cognition, lifestyle, and association. Sweeney and Soutar (2001) and Shen et al. (2016a) divided the customer experience value into functional experience value, emotional experience value, and social experience value. Dai (2020) divided the experience value into instrumental value, spiritual value, emotional value, and social value. Wang et al. (2021b) believed that matching value, growth value, spiritual value, and interactive value are the newly emerging customer experience values in the online consumption situation.\nThe brand is the most important carrier of products. According to the above literature, the value of a product experience felt by customers is actually a degree of reaction to the brand. Braunsberger and Munch (1998) believed that consumer experience is obtained by contacting the brand through various activities. As the basic unit of the brand, each dimension may have an impact on customers\u2019 different experience value levels, which affect customers\u2019 purchase intention. Therefore, this study innovatively proposes that choosing the experience value division dimension combined with multi-dimensional and hierarchical levels can better verify that the experience value of the brand elements of different dimensions stimulates customer purchase intention.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 873041\nThis study, based on the existing literature, divides the experience value dimensions into four categories, namely, functional experience value, emotional experience value, social experience value, and service experience value. The basis of division mainly considers the consumers\u2019 demand factors for the product itself (the cognition of the product function and emotion) and the importance of the brand attributes (the diversified perception of the social attributes of the brand and the services provided)."

            "text": "As a behavioral trend, purchase intention is composed of consumers\u2019 attitudes, evaluation, and other factors (Jing and Shang, 2017), which reflect the psychological activities of consumers in making purchasing decisions in a specific environment. According to Blackwell and Miniard (2001), consumers make purchasing decisions on a particular brand based on finding information about an internal and external environment. Mao et al. (2020) focused on investigating consumer purchases through identity and brand-related structures. The results show that the flow experience, brand image, brand communication, brand personality, and brand identity all directly or indirectly explain the purchase intention. Flow experience plays a key intermediary role in the path from brand communication, brand character, and brand identity to purchase intention. Maharani et al. (2020) offered a proposal on factors that affect the willingness to buy products of selfowned brand products, in which in-store promotion, visual marketing, and in-store image directly affect customer value and purchase intention. Li and Zhang (2020) believed that consumer intention to repurchase is affected by their functional value, economic value, and perceived risk. Tong et al. (2020) believed that customer experience not only determines customers\u2019 own perception and satisfaction after consumption but also can spread outward at the speed of geometric series through modern marketing environments, such as the Internet, thus affecting others\u2019 consumption decisions and production or service performance. In addition, social responsibility (Ma, 2011; Chen, 2017), perceived value (Zhong, 2013), consumer trust (Escobar-Rodr\u00edguez and Bons\u00f3n-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2017), and other factors will affect consumer purchase intention to some extent.\nTo sum up, consumer purchase intention is complex and will be affected by a variety of factors. Based on the previous literature, this article explores the influence on the purchase intention from two factors and multiple dimensions, which include brand elements and experience value. At the same time, it also focuses on age, education, gender, occupation, income, and commodity type of the variables."

Ma and Wang (2015) took cultural identity as the research perspective and examined the different effects of various forms of cultural identity on consumer purchase intention. An et al.

In terms of brand value, Braunsberger and Munch (1998) showed that the consumer experience of brand value is acquired through various activities, existing in the stages of brand recognition, purchase decision-making, and product use. In terms of brand culture, the results of Dirisu et al. (2018) showed that brand culture has a significant positive impact on the perceived experience value of the product. Quach et al. (2020) believed that experience value has a positive impact on both brand attitude and purchase engagement. The more the customers pay attention to privacy, the stronger the impact of experience value on the brand attitude. In terms of brand character, Jin et al. (2012) pointed out that luxury brands bring consumers a good functional experience and high social value, as well as emotional and service experience. When studying service industry brands, Yang (2014) combined the brand character with experience to obtain the application of the law of brand clothing in experience design. Zhang (2019) confirmed that the brand will improve customer purchase intention and explained that the brand-related stimuli make consumers obtain psychological and behavioral experience perception, including brand recognition, brand image, communication methods, and marketing environment. Xu et al. (2021) believed that only by fully guiding consumers\u2019 brand interaction and mobilizing and enhancing consumers\u2019 brand experience, can the brand value be effectively realized. To sum up, it can be seen that the conscious strengthening and promotion of various dimensions of brand elements (brand character, brand value, and brand culture) can make consumers perceive the acquisition of multi-level experience value, such as high quality (functional value), social status (social value), emotional and sensory experience (emotional value), service perception (service value), etc. Thus, this study puts forward Hypothesis H2: Brand elements can impose a positive impact on the experience value. On the basis of proposing H2, the correspondence is subdivided from the respective constituent dimensions of brand elements and experience value to further propose the following assumptions: H2a: Brand character, brand value, and brand culture can, respectively, impose positive impacts on the functional value. H2b: Brand character, brand value, and brand culture can, respectively, impose positive impacts on emotional value. H2c: Brand character, brand value, and brand culture can, respectively, impose positive impacts on social value.

When studying the value of the online shopping experience, Sun (2018) pointed out that satisfaction and social experience perception can improve consumers\u2019 happiness. Zhao (2019) studied the relationship between retail brand image, perceived experience value, and consumer care behavior, and found that both quality image and commodity display image can positively affect consumer perceived value. In addition to cognitive value, functional value, emotional value, and economic value can significantly promote consumer care behavior. Tang et al. (2021) pointed out that both brand marketing stimulation and external stimulation have a significant positive impact on experience marketing motivation. Then, experience marketing motivation has a significant positive impact on purchase intention.\nTo sum up, it can be inferred that the perception of experience value (including functional, emotional, social, and service value) can stimulate consumers\u2019 purchase behavior to a certain extent and positively affect their purchase intention. So, this hypothesis is proposed:\nH3: Experience value can impose a positive impact on the purchase intention of consumers. H3a: Functional value can impose a positive impact on the purchase intention of consumers. H3b: Emotional value can impose a positive impact on the purchase intention of consumers.\nH3c: Social value can impose a positive impact on the purchase intention of consumers.

Finally, the mediation effect validation was performed, through which way the independent variable affects the dependent variable, which belongs to the analysis of causal transmission. In the output results, the first display is the results of the first regression equation, focusing on whether the regression coefficient is significant.

However, as mentioned earlier in this study, consumers\u2019 purchase intention is complex and will be affected by many factors. The brand element composition and experience value dimension proposed in this study are personal views obtained through a\nlarge number of studies. Compared with the research findings of global scholars in relevant fields during the same period, there are still many views worthy of reference. Lee et al. (2019) explored the impact of brand symbols on consumer behavior through the research on consumption patterns in the Internet environment and verified that brands have a significant positive impact on the perceived value by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Kovanoviene et al. (2021) proposed the essence of marketing communication tools to help build a relationship between the consumer and the brand or company, so it can be considered to be a key tool for shaping the consumer loyalty. Diddi et al. (2019) expanded the meaning of brand elements: recyclability, durability, and repairability, and the positive impact of these characteristics on consumers\u2019 value orientation through the study of clothing consumption patterns. Vatamanescu et al. (2021) held the similar views. Compared with the period before and after the outbreak of COVID-19, it is proposed that consumers attach great importance to the social and environmental sustainability practices since the spread of the virus. Patak et al. (2021) put forward the concept of consumers\u2019 green purchase intention and pointed out that environmental concern, green lifestyle, and product knowledge are the main influencing factors. Similarly, Guo et al. (2021) put forward the concept of sustainable consumption intention. Thus, COVID19 has profoundly changed the underlying factors of consumer buying behavior (Valaskova et al., 2021)."
