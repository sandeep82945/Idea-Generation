    "abstractText": "To examine sleep latency and sleep disturbance as mediators between nighttime cell phone use variables (cell phone use for unstructured leisure activities and for accessing emotionally charged media content before sleep: CPU_BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal) and psychological well-being (PWB) of college students. 521 (74% female) undergraduate students from a large public university were surveyed using a validated self-report quantitative questionnaire assessing CPU variables, sleep quality, and PWB. Pearson correlation analyses were used to compute the correlation between CPU_BeforeBed, CPU_Arousal, sleep latency, and sleep disturbance. Ordinary least-squares regressions were conducted to assess the estimates of the relationships within the models. One-way ANOVA was used to see the difference between the groups. The partial eta squared was used to determine the effect size between the groups. The PROCESS method was used to perform mediation analyses. The sample consisted of undergraduate students between 18 and 29 years old, with an average age of 20 years (SD = 3.18). The sample was diverse in terms of ethnicity (49% Caucasian, 24% Latinx, 19% Asian, 3% African American, 1% Native American, 3% identified as \u201cother\u201d) and the number of years the participants had been attending a 2 year or 4 year higher institution (38% incoming freshman, 19% sophomore, 17% junior, 14% senior, and 13% returning senior). The correlation between CPU_BeforeBed and PWB (\u03b1 = \u2212 0.044, p = 0.615), and the correlation between CPU_Arousal and PWB (\u03b1 = \u2212 0.061, p = 0.228) were not statistically significant. However, the correlation between sleep latency and PWB (\u03b1 = \u2212 0.140, p = 0.001), and the correlation between sleep disturbance and PWB (\u03b1 = \u2212 0.121, p = 0.005) were statistically significant. The mediation effect of sleep latency on the association between CPU_BeforeBed and PWB (Effect = \u2212 0.0325, SE = 0.0145, p < 0.05), and the mediation effect of sleep disturbance on the association between CPU_Arousal and PWB (Effect = \u2212 0.0214, SE = 0.0086, p < 0.05) were statistically significant. Sleep latency and sleep disturbance act as a mediator on the association between CPU_BeforeBed and PWB, and the association between CPU_Arousal and PWB. However, CPU_BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal did not have a direct impact on their PWB. These findings may help college students in regulating CPU habits before going to bed. These findings may also help medical practitioners make informed decisions about the use of cell phones for patients with sleep-related disorders.",

Being the largest demographic users of cell phones [3], college students were particularly vulnerable to sleep problems such as sleep latency (trouble sleeping) and sleep disturbance (disturbances in the amount and quality of sleep) [4, 5]. Sleep latency occurred due to sleep displacement and * Suresh C. Joshi contactscjoshi@gmail.com 1 Jindal School of\u00a0Psychology and\u00a0Counselling, O.P.

CPU-led sleep disruption theories state that sleep displacement happens when the brain believes it is still working while using a cell phone in bed for restriction-free leisure activities, and sleep disturbance happens when cell phones are used to access emotionally charged media content before sleep [6\u20138]. CPU usage for leisure activities before bed (CPU_BeforeBed) was shown to attribute to CPU-led sleep latency and disturbance when users accessed sexually explicit, violently explicit, or emotionally charged media content before sleep (CPU_Arousal) [6].\nThe impact of CPU on sleep latency and sleep disturbance has been continuously reported in previous literature. For example, there was a positive correlation between excessive CPU, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction in college students [9]. This study also showed a negative correlation between excessive CPU and subjective sleep quality. Other studies [10, 11] indicated that college students perceived cell phones as devices that compelled them to be available around the clock, leading to sleep disturbances. Calling and texting functions contributed substantially to sleep disturbance including short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and subjective sleep quality [10]. In fact, text messaging alone significantly contributed to sleep latency and sleep disturbance in college students [7]. Interacting with cell phones before sleep affected emotional and/or mental arousal, which further increased sleep latency and sleep disturbance [6, 12]. Further, playing video games before sleep elongated the time associated with sleep latency, and reduced overall sleep quality [8]. Studies concerning CPUrelated sleep latency and sleep difficulty are abundantly reflected in previous literature, however, the impact of such correlations on mental health outcomes, especially psychological well-being (PWB), is warranted.\nPrevious studies show correlations between sleep quality and PWB, where sleep quality influenced PWB variables such as stress, depression, and anxiety [13, 14]. Poor sleep quality has also been associated with depressive symptoms, cognitive emotion regulation style [15], and lower levels of PWB [16]. Further, poor sleep quality was also found to be a strong predictor of depression and anxiety in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic [17]. Lastly, a causal relationship was established between sleep quality and stress, anxiety, and depression in a study conducted on college students [18]. In sum, poor sleep quality has shown to be detrimental to PWB levels.\nAs indicated above, CPU-led sleep quality, the sleep quality affected due to the use of cell phones after going to bed, was found to be detrimental to mental health outcomes such as anxiety and depression in college students [19]. For example, in a sample with college students, texting and calling alone created sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression [20].\nExcessive CPU negatively affected PWB levels and mental health in college students [21]. Further, technology use was found to be associated with depression and anxiety as a result of lower sleep quality [22]. Thus, CPU, especially at nighttime, escalated sleep-related problems in college students [6, 11, 23]. Ultimately, nighttime CPU intensified stress and depressive symptoms in young adults [9, 14, 24].\nIn previous studies, CPU was found to be correlated with sleep quality, and sleep quality was found to be correlated with the PWB in the college student population [13\u201317]. CPU-led sleep quality was also found to be correlated to the PWB of college students [21]. The mediating role of sleep quality between technology use and PWB variables such as anxiety and depression [22], and problematic mobile phone use and depression [25] was examined in previous studies. However, the mediating role of sleep quality variables between nighttime CPU and PWB was left unexplored. The present study, therefore, examined the role of sleep quality variables such as sleep latency and sleep disturbance for the association of the respective nighttime CPU components (i.e., CPU_BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal) and PWB in college students.\nThe research hypotheses of this study are as follows:\nH1: CPU_BeforeBed relate negatively to the PWB; H2: CPU_Arousal relate negatively to the PWB; H3: Sleep latency is a mediator between CPU_BeforeBed and PWB; H4:\u00a0Sleep disturbance is a mediator between CPU_ Arousal and PWB.\nThe mediator models for CPU-led sleep quality and PWB are presented in Figs.\u00a01 and 2."

The number of hours spent in bed were calculated using the scores of questions 1 and 3. The percentage of habitual sleep efficiency was calculated by the following: (Number of hours slept/Number of hours spent in bed) \u00d7 100. These percentages were translated into categorical variables as follows: \u201c > 85%\u201d\u20140, \u201c75\u201384%\u201d\u20141, \u201c65\u201374\u201d\u20142, \u201c < 65%\u201d\u20143 [26].\nThe use of sleep medication was measured using question 4 of the PSQI, and the scores were translated into categorical variables as follows: Q7) During the past month, how often have you taken medicine (prescribed or \u201cover the\u00a0counter\u201d) to help you sleep?

            "text": "This study aimed to (1) test the correlation between nighttime CPU and PWB, and (2) test the role of sleep latency and sleep disturbance as mediators between nighttime CPU and PWB of college students. Four hypotheses were developed to achieve these goals. H1 and H2 examined the relationship between CPU and PWB of college students\u2014both H1 and H2 were unsupported, and the results indicated that CPU_BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal were unrelated to the PWB of college students. H3 and H4 examined the mediating role of sleep latency and sleep disturbance between CPU and PWB of young adults\u2014both of which were supported. The outcomes revealed that sleep latency acts as a mediator between CPU_BeforeBed and PWB. Further, sleep disturbance acts as a mediator between CPU_Arousal and PWB of college students.\nTo the best of my knowledge, this study would be the first of its kind to examine nighttime CPU and PWB of college students. In this study, CPU_BeforeBed assessed the use of cell phones for unstructured leisure activities before sleep, which included whether participants have awakened\nafter going to bed (or stayed up late after a target bedtime) due to the following cell phone operations/activities: calling, texting, checking notifications, emailing, listening to Podcasts, listening to music, social networking, watching videos (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), gaming, and non-social-media internet browsing (shopping, surfing, etc.). CPU_Arousal assessed the use of cell phones for accessing emotionally charged media content before sleep, which included two things (1) participants\u2019 engagement with their cell phones towards emotionally charged texts and messages, explicit content pertaining to sexuality (pornography, tinder, dating sites, etc.), and explicit content pertaining to violence (video games, movies, etc.), and (2) the rate of occurrence of uses mentioned in the first three items that kept participants awake. The flourishing scale assessed the self-perceived success of the participants in important areas such as relationships, self-esteem, purpose, and optimism.\nConcerning the first hypothesis, the correlation between CPU_BeforeBed and PWB was not statistically significant, which implied that using cell phones after going to bed or staying up late after a target bedtime due to the use of cell phones did not affect the PWB of college students. For the second hypothesis, the correlation between CPU_Arousal and PWB was not statistically significant, which implied that using cell phones for accessing emotionally charged media content before sleep did not affect the PWB of college students.\nThese results suggested that the use of cell phones from a specific time and for a specific purpose did not influence the PWB. There may be the case that CPU measures from a specific time of the day or night would not suffice for finding the relationship between CPU and PWB. Quantifiable measures assessing the estimates of the total amount of time spent using cell phones per day, along with the measures of CPU_BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal may help clarify the relationship between the two variables. Also, quantifiable measures assessing the use of cell phones for various activities including the use of cell phones for social media (Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, etc.) would help clarify on the relationship between CPU and PWB as social media has been shown to have a direct impact on the PWB of college students [32, 33].\nConcerning the third hypothesis (i) there was an increase in sleep latency due to higher CPU_BeforeBed, as determined by least-squares regression analysis (model 1, Table\u00a04), and (ii) the scores of PWB decreased with the increase in the levels of CPU-led sleep latency, as determined by least-squares regression analysis (model 2, Table\u00a04). These results support the fact that CPU \u2018in bed\u2019 and CPU \u2018after lights were out\u2019 negatively influenced sleep latency in college students [4, 7, 32]. There are two implications that can be made from these outcomes i) the use of cell phones after a target bedtime resulted in higher risks of sleep\n1 3\nlatency in college students, (ii) the increased levels of sleep latency due to the use of cell phones before bed decreased the PWB of college students. The first implication confirmed a direct impact of CPU_BeforeBed on sleep latency of college students and the second implication confirmed a direct impact of sleep latency on PWB of college students. Combining both the implications, CPU_BeforeBed impacts PWB through sleep latency.\nThe estimates of the indirect effects of CPU variables on PWB through sleep variables were analyzed using PROCESS in two mediation models. The first mediation model (Fig.\u00a03) showed that there was an indirect effect of CPU_ BeforeBed on PWB via an intermediatory variable of sleep latency. This means college students who were having sleep interruptions due to CPU_BeforeBed had lower levels of PWB. Cell phone addiction [28, 34] may be one of the reasons people use cell phones for unstructured leisure\u00a0activities after a target bedtime, which could lead to the development of sleep latency, thereby lowering the overall PWB of college students.\nConcerning the fourth hypothesis (i) there was an increase in sleep disturbance due to higher CPU_Arousal, as determined by least-squares regression analysis (model 3, Table\u00a04), and (ii) the scores of PWB were decreased with the increase in the levels of CPU-led sleep disturbance y, as determined by least-squares regression analysis (model 4, Table\u00a04). These results had two implications (i) the use of cell phones for accessing emotionally charged media content after a target bedtime resulted in higher risks of sleep disturbance in college students, (ii) the increased levels of sleep disturbance due to the use of cell phones for accessing emotionally charged media content after a target bedtime decreased the PWB of college students. The first implication confirmed a direct impact of CPU_Arousal on sleep disturbance of college students and the second implication confirmed a direct impact of sleep disturbance on PWB of college students. Combining both the implications, CPU_ Arousal impacts PWB through sleep disturbance.\nThe indirect effect of CPU_Arousal on PWB via an intermediatory variable of sleep disturbance was depicted by the second mediation model (Fig.\u00a04). This indirect effect demonstrated that college students who had disturbances while sleeping due to CPU_Arousal had lower levels of PWB. College students with cell phone addiction [9] or addiction towards accessing sexually explicit, violently explicit, or emotionally charged media content before bed might lead to higher sleep disturbance, which in turn reduces their PWB.\nThese results align with previous studies analyzing the mediating effects of sleep quality and technology use, including CPU, and PWB variables such as anxiety and depression. Adams and Kisler [22] suggested that sleep quality acts as a mediator between technology use before sleep and depressions and anxiety in college students. Zou et\u00a0al.\n[25] suggested that sleep quality played a mediating role in the association of problematic mobile phone use and depression in college students. The present study has gone a step further and investigated the mediating effects of the crucial components of sleep quality (i.e., sleep latency and sleep disturbance) for the association of the respective nighttime CPU components (i.e., CPU_BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal) and PWB in college students.\nCPU-led sleep displacement and psychological arousal mechanisms [6] can explain these mediating effects. The mediating role of sleep latency between CPU_BeforeBed and PWB may be related to the displacement of sleep that \u201chappens when the brain believes it is still working because one continues to use a cell phone while in bed.\u201d In such situations, the brain creates an association between the location of the CPU (i.e., the bed) and work (i.e., CPU). The mediating role of sleep disturbance between CPU_Arousal and PWB may be related to psychological arousal that happens due to the use of electronic media such as cell phones just before going to bed. In such situations, the brain takes time to prepare for sleep after mental (cognitive), emotional, and/ or psychological arousal is created due to media content or cell phone screen time. In both cases, sleep gets disrupted or delayed, which may result in lowering the PWB of college students."

            "heading": "Implications",
            "text": "The findings from this study provide implications for both clinical and non-clinical settings. In clinical settings, findings can be used for college students having sleep problems and problems regarding changing their CPU behavior in order to improve their PWB. College students can make informed decisions about the use of cell phones, especially before going to bed. The mediator role of sleep variables between nighttime CPU and PWB showed that using cell phones at night escalates sleep problems in college students, which further affects their PWB. PWB encompasses mental health variables stress, anxiety, and depression [35]. Therefore, the health conditions of college students with these mental health problems may be heightened with the prolonged use of cell phones before bed. These results align with the outcomes from a previous study, which indicated that interacting with cell phones before sleep escalates emotional and/or mental (cognitive) arousal in college students, and increases their sleep disturbance [5, 23].\nIn non-clinical settings, the mediation effect of CPU_ BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal on PWB through sleep latency and sleep disturbance will guide nighttime cell phone users about the negative consequences of the use of cell phones before going to bed. The detrimental effects of CPU on the PWB through sleep components will educate clinical and\n1 3\nnon-clinical researchers regarding the confounding effects of sleep variables while studying CPU or PWB of college students. Knowing the harmful effects of CPU, especially for unstructured leisure activities and for accessing emotionally charged media content before bed, will create awareness about the use of cell phones from a specific time, particularly during evening/night, and for a specific purpose. Such awareness will guide CPUsers, especially college students, to limit their nighttime cell phone screen time and will help them regulate their nighttime CPU behaviors such as putting cell phones away before sleep hours or avoiding accessing sexually explicit, violently explicit, or emotionally charged media content before sleep. Additionally, the outcomes will have recurring implications for future studies, health professionals, and cell phone manufacturers."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "A few limitations should be considered while interpreting the outcomes of this study. The sample is comprised of undergraduate students from a single public university in the Southwestern United States. This may reflect some socio-economic and cultural specificities of university students from the Southwestern region. Also, the outcomes may have limitations for non-college CPUsers from the young adult demographic as the sample included traditional undergraduate students. Though the enrollment of the female undergraduate students (54%) was higher than the male undergraduate students (46%) at the recruiting institution, the overrepresentation for female participants in the study sample should be treated as a limitation. Low response rate is another limitation of this study. In addition, the measures relied on self-report which led to another limitation such as recall bias, which is one of the key concerns about selfreported questionnaires. Further, other factors occurring while taking the survey such as, non-academic workload, studies, leisure activities, family, and social commitments cannot be ignored.\nThis is a cross-sectional study, therefore, it cannot detect a causal relationship between the study variables. Although this study shows the mediating effect of sleep variables concerning CPU and PWB, the influence of variables from other mental health domains such as negative affect, positive affect, happiness, social function, stress response, anxiety, depression, psychological symptom, quality of life, and general health cannot be ruled out. Given the numerous factors influencing the relationship between sleep and cell phone use, it is possible that unmeasured factors such as substance use and the use of stimulating beverages could confound the outcome of the present study. Although the data was collected just\nafter midterm exams, the study did not consider the timing of data collection. Also, the study did not take any factors related to student activities into account that may affect\u00a0sleep\u00a0latency and\u00a0sleep\u00a0disturbance, such as athletic competitions (for student-athletes), scheduled vacations, examinations including midterms, degree of disturbance of course loads, etc. Additionally, this study did not assess underlying mood disorders and the use of sleep medication, which may be prevalent and affect\u00a0 sleep\u00a0 latency and\u00a0sleep\u00a0disturbance."

CPU variables such as the total time spent on cell phones per day should be treated as one of the independent variables. Other sleep variables of the PSQI scale such as subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, and habitual sleep efficiency should also be tested as mediating variables. Embedded sensors and built-in cell phone apps should be used to gain an in-depth understanding of the emotionally charged media content assessed on cell phones that affect sleep. Separate scales should be used to measure stress, anxiety, and depression, along with the flourishing scale. Analyzing the consistency of individual scales measuring PWB variables with the scale measuring overall PWB (i.e., flourishing scale) would be worthwhile. Moreover, a study assessing the impact of CPU on sleep quality, and PWB variables such as stress, depression, and anxiety, during quarantine is warranted.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s41105- 022- 00388-3.\nAcknowledgments I thank the editor and the reviewers of this manuscript for their comments in each round of the revisions.\nFunding This study received no funding."
