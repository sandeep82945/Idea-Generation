            "text": "Endohedral fullerenes or endofullerenes are closed shell fullerenes encapsulating atoms, molecules or clusters. They can be synthesized using several techniques, among which high pressure incorporation or molecular beam implantation.1\u20133 For instance, the former approach allowed to achieve the incorporation of noble gas atoms.4\u20137 More recently, Kurotobi and Murata developed a molecular surgery technique to open a C60, insert a water molecule, and close up the carbon shell.8 Bloodworth et al. used a related approach to trap a noble gas atom or a methane molecule into C60.9,10\nStudying endofullerenes is interesting and important in several ways. A first incentive would be the controlled modification of properties caused by the presence of the guest molecule or cluster. For example let us consider mechanical properties, which are nowadays satisfactorily understood for the empty C60, thanks to several dedicated studies.11\u201316 We know that C60 is a resilient molecule,17 which can sustain a huge elastic deformation up to about 48%.16 For larger compression strains, the yielding of the C60 shell by bond breaking is observed, but a perfect or weakly defected structure can be recovered by unloading if the strain does\na Institut P\u2032, CNRS UPR 3346, Universit\u00e9 de Poitiers, SP2MI, Boulevard Marie et Pierre Curie, TSA 41123, 86073 Poitiers Cedex 9, France.

See DOI: 10.1039/cXCP00000x/\nnot exceed 75%. It is rational to assume that introducing one or several atoms inside the C60 shell could change this picture, especially at large deformations. For instance, an endofullerene could probably be stiffer than the empty fullerene. Also, both the yield stress and the plasticity mechanisms could be affected.\nA promising feature of endofullerenes is that they provide a unique mean to encapsulate and isolate a single atom or molecule, opening the way to potential applications in memory storage or quantum computations,18 or to investigate the intrinsic properties of the trapped guest. The properties and characteristics of the latter could also be modified by applying an external perturbation on the endofullerene. For instance, on the basis of first-principles calculations, Sabirov and co-workers predicted that the dissociation of a trapped H2O or CH4 molecule could be achieved by the compression of the C60 host.19,20 Futhermore squeezing the C60 shell leads to a reduction of its internal volume, which could potentially put a single atom in a high pressure state.\nThe last decades have witnessed an impressive development of experimental apparatus allowing to probe mechanical properties of matter at the nanoscale.21,22 For instance the controlled compression of single nanoparticles with a size equal to a few tens of nm has been achieved.23\u201327 However, systems as small as fullerenes or endofullerenes remain out of reach of the current capabilities. Note that scanning probe techniques have been successfully used to probe the mechanical properties of C60, but that these investigations are restricted to a low deformation regime.28,29 Numerical simulations are often a useful complement or substitute to experiments, and a large number of classical\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1 10 | 1\nmolecular dynamics calculations have been devoted to determine the mechanical properties of nanoparticles (for a recent review see Ref.30). Critical issues are however the lack of available classical interatomic potentials for multicomponents systems or their questionable reliability at the nanoscale and for large deformations. To overcome this hurdle, we have recently developed a numerical approach allowing for the compression of nano-objects at finite temperature by combining first principles MD calculations with classical force fields. In the present study, this approach is applied to investigate the properties of X@C60 endofullerenes under compression. Several X guests are considered: single noble gas atoms from He to Xe, clusters of He atoms, and methane and water molecules.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In the section 2 the setup of the simulations is described with all details provided. The section 3 is dedicated to the structure and stability of the endofullerenes at room temperature. Their mechanical properties are described in the section 4. Finally the section 5 is dedicated to the state of the atoms and molecules encapsulated into the compressed C60 shell. Our conclusions are gathered in the final section."

The thermostat targets are an electronic kinetic energy of 0.005 a.u. for electrons and a temperature of 300 K for ions, respectively. These parameters were shown to be appropriate for C60 compression in a previous work.15\nThe electronic structure is calculated using density functional theory.34,35 A good convergence is obtained with a plane waves basis cutoff of 25 Ry, except for systems including an oxygen ion for which a larger cutoff of 40 Ry is employed. The PerdewBurke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used to compute exchangecorrelation contributions.36 Interactions between ions and electrons are described with ultrasoft pseudopotentials.37 All calculations are carried out using a cubic supercell with a length of 20 \u00c5, which is large enough to prevent spurious interactions between the endofullerene and its periodic images.15\nWith these parameters, carbon bond lengths of 1.401 \u00c5 and 1.451 \u00c5 are obtained when the C60 structure is relaxed with a conjugate gradient energy minimization, in excellent agreement with the literature.38"

            "text": "Two different sets of MD calculations are carried out. In the first one, each X@C60 system is let free to evolve at 300 K for 20 ps. The first 10 ps are long enough to achieve thermalization. Different properties can then be extracted by averaging over the last 10 ps. These simulations are useful to determine the structure\nand the stability at 300 K, described in section 3.\nIn the second set, the uniaxial compression of each endofullerene is achieved by following the methodology described in details in Ref.15, and only briefly reported here. Each system is orientated so that the z-axis, the compression axis by convention, passes through opposite pentagons in the C60 shell. In the MD simulations a repulsive quadratic force field acting on ions is activated. Atoms with z-coordinates above an upper threshold value are pushed down by the force field. Similarly, atoms with zcoordinates below a lower threshold value are pushed up. The upper (lower) threshold value is decreased (increased) at each time step, thus allowing for a continuous and smooth compression of the endofullerene. The chosen increment is 1\u00d710\u22125 \u00c5, yielding a compression speed of 0.1 \u00c5/ps, which is typical of nanoparticles compression simulations.14,30,39 The strength of the force field is set to 30 a.u., thus modeling an extremely stiff flat-punch indenter.\nBoth the total energy and the contact force are recorded at each MD step. The contact force is equal to half the sum of all repulsion contributions from the force field. Note that each pushed ion also experiences a friction force perpendicular to the compression axis and proportional to its mass, its velocity, and a parameter \u0393 equal to 500 a.u. This additional constraint hinders the free rotation of the quasi-spherical C60 shell during the compression.15\nThe engineering strain \u03b5 = \u03b4d/d0 is used in this work, the reference length d0 being determined for each system during the first set of MD calculations. Because of the small dimensions involved, the strain accuracy is estimated to be at best 1%. A typical MD compression run involves 2.2\u00d7 105 iterations i.e., 44 ps. This is long enough to achieve compression strains up to 60%."

            "text": "We also determine the Bader volume and charge of all atoms during the compression by performing an Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis40 using the CRITIC2 tool.41 More precisely, the atomic structure is first extracted from the compression run for a selected configuration at a given time step. A separate self-consistent field calculation is next carried out using Quantum Espresso and the same parameters than in MD calculations. The only difference is that the ion-electron interactions are now calculated in the framework of the PAW method.42 This allows for recovering the all-electrons density close to the nuclei, which is required for an accurate determination of the atomic basins in the AIM approach. Once this last step is achieved, per-atom quantities like the Bader volume VB and the charge are computed by integration of the pseudo-density using the Yu-Trinkle algorithm,43 and summed for each X guest. The charge is expressed as the excess number of electrons relative to the ground state. For instance, a value of +0.19 e\u2212 for He10@C60 means an excess of 0.19 electrons carried by He10 (and then a deficit of 0.19 electrons for C60). It is important to specify that the atomic volume cannot be unambiguously defined, and that AIM is only one method among others to perform a spatial decomposition. Variations of AIM-derived quantities like the atomic volume or the excess charge are useful indicators to monitor the systems during compression, but one should\n2 | 1 10Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nnot put too much weight on their absolute values."

            "heading": "3 Structure and stability",
            "text": "We first describe and discuss the structure and energetic stability at 300 K and with no compression, for all investigated systems. In the case of a single noble gas atom, it is generally agreed in the literature51\u201353 that (i) the deformation of the C60 shell is negligible, (ii) the binding energy between X and C60 is small, equal to a few hundredths of eV at most in absolute value, (iii) its sign seems to be highly dependent on the calculation method, and (iv) the most stable structure retains the Ih symmetry with a centered noble gas atom. Our results are overall in accordance with these conclusions, with C60 shell dimensions changes \u2206dH and \u2206dP smaller than 0.01 \u00c5 and low binding energies (Tab. 1), and a noble gas at the C60 center. We find a negative binding energy i.e., an attractive interaction, only in the case of Xe@C60. We emphasize that we do not aim at the same precision than in the previously published works, based on 0 K hybrid functional calculations with corrections for zero point energy and dispersion forces.51\u201353 In the present study our accuracy is essentially limited by the finite temperature averaging and the use of the approximate PBE exchange-correlation functional. Note that we performed additional calculations including semi-empirical dispersion contributions,54 which show that these corrections are negligible. Furthermore, as will be detailed in the following, the strain energies associated with mechanical compression are typically 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than the binding energies. Table 1 also reports the charge transfer \u2206Q between X and C60 as estimated with the AIM approach. This charge transfer is found to be zero (He and Ne) or equivalent to a small electron deficit (Ar and Xe). The Kr case is puzzling with a transfer from X to C60\nof 0.39 e\u2212, one order of magnitude larger than for other noble gas.\nConsidering CH4, we find that the initial Td symmetry of the molecule is preserved during 20 ps at 300 K, with the carbon atom located at the C60 center (Fig. 1-a). The C60 deformation is negligible, which may mean that the molecule is relatively free to rotate. However, rotation is barely observed during the 20 ps run, hinting at some directional interaction between C60 and CH4. Our calculated binding energy is -0.789 eV (Tab. 1), i.e. the interaction is attractive. This appears to be slightly lower than the 0 K values reported in the literature.55,56 There is no charge transfer between CH4 and C60. The C\u2013H bond length in CH4 is 1.098 \u00c5 in average at 300 K, in excellent agreement with previous works.55 It is slightly lower than the computed bond length of 1.113 \u00c5 for the free CH4 molecule, in agreement with a weak interaction with the C60 host.\nOur calculations also show that the interaction between H2O and C60 is minimal, with almost no perturbation of the C60 geometry (Tab. 1). The computed binding energy is close to zero, in agreement with results from Galano et al.56 However, earlier investigations reported values ranging from -0.50 to -0.02 eV.57,58 The encapsulated H2O molecule retains the C2v symmetry (Fig. 1- b), with a H\u2013O bond length decrease of 0.004 \u00c5 and a H\u0302OH angle increase of 0.22\u25e6 compared to the free molecule at 300 K. Similar negligible changes are reported in the literature.57,58 We also find that the O atom of the H2O molecule remains close to the C60 center during the 300 K run, and that the molecule rotates easily as expected.29,59 \u2206Q is only -0.02 e\u2212 in agreement with previous calculations based on AIM.58\nFinally, we tested two helium clusters endofullerenes, He6@C60 and He10@C60. Such systems are unlikely to exist in nature or to be synthesized, but can be used to investigate the influence on mechanical properties of the internal pressure built by helium atoms. Starting from a random configuration for He atoms, it is observed that He6 quickly evolves towards a highly symmetric (Oh) structure (Fig. 1-c) during the calculation. For He10, a low symmetry compact configuration is obtained (Fig. 1-d). Compared to a single NG atom, the binding energies are large and positive (Tab. 1), confirming that these compounds have little chances to be synthesized. Despite this large repulsion, it is remarkable that the C60 shell expansion remains limited, with dimensions increase of 0.017-0.019 and 0.07-0.08 \u00c5 respectively. This confirms that C60 is characterized by an outstanding structural resistance to high internal pressures.7 Finally, we also determine excess charges of 0.13 and 0.19 e\u2212 for He6 and He10, respectively.\nThe values of the Bader volume VB at zero strain, calculated with the AIM method, are reported in Tab. 1. The comparison with the solid phase EOS volume V0 indicates that the available volume for accommodating a molecule or atoms in the uncompressed C60 is about 20\u201322 \u00c53. In fact, VB is significantly reduced only for X with larger V0. Therefore, only He and H2O, and to a lesser extent Ne, can be considered to remain unconstrained when encapsulated into C60. Our estimated \"free\" volume value is in agreement with an earlier study.18 It also suggests that a physically good approximation of the C60 shell width is 3.4 \u00c5.60\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1 10 | 3\n4 Mechanical properties of X@C60\nIn this section we focus on the mechanical properties of X@C60 compared to the known behavior for the \"empty\" C60.16 Figure 2 shows the total energy and contact force variations during the uniaxial compression of each studied systems. Most curves share similar characteristics. At low strains, the energy increases\nquadratically and the force linearly, as expected for an elastic regime. The slope of the force curve then decreases as compression proceeds, indicative of non-linear elasticity, up to strains equal to 0.27\u20130.30. This stage corresponds to the flattening of the two C60 azimuth caps in contact with the two repulsion force fields, in accordance with the predicted behavior for the bare C60.16 The various curves also tend to separate in this strain range, because of the growing specific influence of each guest X as compression proceeds. It is particularly significant for He10@C60, for which the contact force first grows steeper than for the others, for strains in the 0.20\u20130.26 range, then slower. This behavior is actually caused by a modification of the helium atoms packing (Fig. 3-(b-d)), as will be discussed in the following.\nAt strains equal to 0.3 the two caps are flattened, and force and energy variations become more steep for greater strain values. One or several maxima can be observed on both sets of curves, with clearly more features on force curves. All these maxima mark the activation of various mechanisms decreasing stress, contact force, and energy. A thorough structural analysis during compression reveals that these mechanisms correspond to changes either in the C60 shell or of the endohedral guest. For instance, the force maximum occurring at 0.40\u20130.41 strain followed by a small decrease for Xe@C60 (Fig. 2) is due to a reorientation of C60 relatively to the compression axis. The compression axis changes from pentagon center (Fig. 3-g) to bond center (Fig. 3-g). A different example is the force maximum at a strain of about 0.42 for CH4@C60, followed by a sharp drop (Fig. 2), which is caused by the dissociation of the CH4 molecule.\nWe find that all force maxima occurring for strains in the range 0.48\u20130.58 are associated with the breaking of one or two carbon bonds in the equatorial part of the C60 shell, as for the bare fullerene.16 For Kr@C60, Ar@C60, Ne@C60, He6@C60 and He10@C60, this is followed by the escape of one or several atoms through shell openings at slightly larger strains, leading to large force and energy drops (See Fig. 3-f,l for two examples). For the other systems, the molecule or the atom remains trapped in the defected shell. Note that in most cases, the compression simulation was stopped after the C60 shell opening. Only in the case of He@C60 the compression was continued up to a strain of 0.80 for which the complete C60 shell failure was observed. This strain threshold value is close to the one determined for the bare C60,16\n4 | 1 10Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nalthough the helium atom remains always trapped.\nTo quantify the influence of X on the mechanical properties of X@C60, we compute the stiffness S by fitting the energy curves with a quadratic function over a 0\u20130.1 strain range. We also determine the strain \u03b5y at which the C60 shell yields, i.e. the first carbon bond breaking, and the corresponding maximum force and energy values Fy and Ey. Data are reported in Table 2 and graphically in Fig. 4. In the latter, data are plotted as a function of V0, the Vinet EOS volume of X (given in Tab. 1), assuming the latter quantity is a fair estimate of its initial volume. This is an arbitrary but convenient choice for the data visualization.\nFigure 4 suggests that the stiffness is roughly proportional to V0. However the increases relatively to the bare C60 remain small. The largest value, obtained for Xe, is for instance only 12% higher than the reference (green strips in Fig. 4). Note that the magnitude of the effect is comparable to stiffness variations associated with the orientation compression of a bare C60. At the other end of the scale X with low V0 such as He or H2O have no noticeable influence on the stiffness. Eventually the only outlier is He10 for which S is the same than for the bare C60 despite a large V0. This result might be explained by the initial dilation of He10@C60 before compression (quantified by \u2206dH and \u2206dP in Tab. 1). For\nsmall deformations, the compression reduces the initial C60 shell expansion, thus lowering the contact force increase rate and then the stiffness. This effect is partially compensated by the influence of He10. Overall our observations suggest that the elastic behavior of the endofullerene is only weakly sensitive to the presence of the X guest, and depends essentially on the C60 shell. This is not surprising if one compares for instance the large differences in elastic moduli between fullerenes61 and noble gas.62\nWe now analyze data related to the yield point, i.e. the yield strain \u03b5y, the energy Ey and force Fy. \u03b5y is not represented in Fig. 4 since this quantity is obviously not correlated to V0 (Tab. 2). Note\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1 10 | 5\nthat there is an estimated 1\u20132% uncertainty in the determination of \u03b5y, because of the sluggish breaking of the first carbon bond and the potential error in the 0% definition. Nevertheless variations remain small and in the stochastic range of values computed for the bare C60.16 Also, we find that the plasticity mechanisms are the same in all cases. This means that the presence of X and its nature have little influence on the strain at which plasticity in the C60 shell is initiated, at least for the various tested systems.\nOn the contrary one can see that X greatly influences both energy and contact force at the yield point, and that the variations are roughly proportional to V0 (Fig. 4). The energy increase compared to the bare C60 is equal to a few eV for He and H2O, and can be as large as 16\u201320 eV for He10. For the contact force, we determine increments of at least 4\u20136 nN for He, and up to 37\u201339 nN for He10 i.e., more than twice the bare C60 value. Both energy and contact force are then highly dependent on X. This is probably because the onset of plasticity occurs at high strain values where both the C60 shell and X are compressed. The contributions of X to the energy and contact force then become significant in this strain regime. They also appear to be roughly proportional to the initial volume V0, although the compressibility of X might be influential as well.\n5 Properties of X in compressed X@C60"

            "text": "Now we analyze how the properties of the atoms or of the molecule encapsulated in C60 are modified by the compression. Figure 5 shows the variations of the volume VB for each X content, calculated with the AIM method. All curves are characterized by similar features. VB decreases slowly at low strains and with an increasing rate as compression proceeds. This behavior is in agreement with our previous statement that at low strains, the mechanical properties of X@C60 are weakly influenced by the presence of X. The sole exception is He10, for which VB tends to decrease almost linearly from the start of the compression. In all cases the steep volume increase for strains greater than 0.5 is due to X or a part of X escaping through the broken C60 shell. Examples of such processes are represented in Fig. 3-f,l.\nUsing the EOS for the various X systems, one can estimate the pressure variation associated with the volume decrease. Obviously, the notion of pressure in the case of a single atom or molecule is conceptual and has to be considered with caution. Furthermore, the stress inside a uniaxially compressed C60 is likely to be not hydrostatic. We argue that this pressure estimation is nonetheless useful to get insights on the state of the C60 guest during the compression. Computed pressure variations during compression are shown in Fig. 5. For most X@C60 systems, the pressure first increases slowly, then faster after a given compression level. The inflection occurs at a strain value of about 0.4 for the biggest X (Kr, Xe) up to about 0.45 for the smallest ones (He, Ne, H2O). It corresponds to X being effectively compressed between the two flattened C60 caps. The situation is different for He6, He10 and to a lesser extent CH4, for which no clear inflection is obtained. This is because the structure of the clusters and of the molecule continuously changes during compression in\norder to better accommodate the stress. For instance, the initial three-dimensional packing of He10 is progressively transformed to a two-dimensional helium layer (Fig. 3-(a-e)). Similarly He6 departs from its initial structure (Fig. 1-c) to a seemingly HCP packing at very low strain (Fig. 3-j), which is next gradually converted to a single helium layer (Fig. 3-(k)).\nMaximal pressure values of 91 GPa (He6), 130 GPa (He10), 210 GPa (Ne), 189 GPa (Ar), 353 GPa (Kr) are determined (Fig. 5). For H2O and CH4, the maximum values for an undissociated molecule are 151 GPa and 44 GPa, respectively. Finally, we also found extremely high pressures of 985 GPa for Xe and 731 GPa for He, the later corresponding to a strain of 0.75. Although these values must be considered with caution, this suggests that single atoms or small molecules in a very high stress state could be achieved, provided of course that the controlled compression at high strain of C60 and endofullerenes would be\n6 | 1 10Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nmade possible in the future.\nThe charge variations \u2206Q for each X, determined using AIM during the compression of X@C60, are shown in Figure 5. For strains below 0.48 i.e., before yielding of the C60 shell, values tend to remain small and weakly dependent on strain for the smallest noble gas atoms like He, Ne and Ar. Larger charge transfers are observed for He6 and He10, but they remain low with a maximum of 0.2 e\u2212 in excess in helium clusters. A surprisingly high electron deficit is determined for Kr, but it is difficult to determine a rationale for variations as a function of strain. By comparison, Xe is characterized by a low electron deficit of 0.09 at zero strain, this value increasing with the compression strain. We determine a maximum electron deficit of 2.2 e\u2212 from Xe to C60 at \u03b5 = 0.63. For H2O and CH4 molecules, the small initial electron transfer to the C60 shell increases as compression proceeds. Hence \u2206Q for H2O decreases to a minimum of -0.25 e\u2212 at \u03b5 = 0.51. Figure 5 shows that for higher strains \u2206Q increases sharply to positive values. However it now corresponds to a dissociated molecule as will be described in the following section. In the case of CH4, the electron deficit in the molecule grows with the compression strain, with a value of -0.1 e\u2212 at \u03b5 = 0.41. Contrary to H2O, \u03b4Q continues to decrease for larger strain values and after molecular transformation, down to a minimum value of -0.6."

            "text": "It has been proposed that the compression of H2O@C60 or CH4@C60 could lead to the formation of endohedral covalent derivatives.19,20 In this section, we examine the evolution of H2O and CH4 inside C60 during the compression to determine whether such mechanisms occur in our calculations.\nConsidering first H2O, we observe that at very low strains the\nmolecule could rotate slowly almost freely in all directions while remaining in the C60 center. Increasing the strain suppresses the rotation, with the molecule contained in the plane perpendicular to the compression axis (Fig. 6-a). The O\u2013H bonds lengths and the H\u0302OH angle remain constant in average with respective values of 0.972 \u00c5 and 104.4\u25e6 until \u03b5 = 0.47. Next they increase up to maximum values of 1.078 \u00c5 and 110.0\u25e6 at \u03b5 = 0.56, while the oxygen atom gets closer to the nearest carbon atoms in the C60 shell (Fig. 6-b). The AIM analysis shows that the two H atoms have each a deficit of 0.6 e\u2212, and the C atom an excess of 1.0 e\u2212 in average. At \u03b5 = 0.57, one hydrogen atom separates from the oxygen and forms a C\u2013H bond with a C60 shell atom (Fig. 6-c). Its charge deficit is reduced to about 0.2 e\u2212, and the O excess charge becomes 0.9 e\u2212. It corresponds to an electron deficit of 0.1 e\u2212 in C60. For these compression strains, the separation between top and bottom flattened C60 caps becomes small enough to consider that the remaining hydroxide ion interacts with the two closest top and bottom shell carbon atoms. Also, the lone hydrogen atom seems to form short lifetime bonds alternatively with a top and a bottom C atom. At \u03b5 = 0.60\u22120.61, we observe the formation of an epoxide group (Fig. 6-d), followed by the separation of the second H atom from O and the formation of a C\u2013H bond (Fig. 6-e). This H atom exhibits a charge deficit of 0.2 e\u2212, like for the first hydrogen atom. The epoxide group is characterized by C\u2013O bond lengths of 1.3\u20131.4 \u00c5 and a C\u2013C bond length of 1.55 \u00c5. The charge is in excess of 1.05 e\u2212 on the O atom, and in deficit of about 0.35 e\u2212 on these two C atoms. Finally, as compression proceeds, this C\u2013C bond progressively breaks which triggers the fracture of C60 and the escape of the oxygen and of one hydrogen through the created hole (Fig. 6-f). A movie showing the H2O@C60 compression is available in the Supplementary Material.\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1 10 | 7\nSabirov and co-workers reported a similar dissociated H2O configuration at a strain of 0.58, with the formation of an epoxide group and two remote C\u2013H bonds.19 The excellent agreement with the present work is impressive given that our methodology for computing electronic structure and applying compression is different, and also that their simulations are done at 0 K. In the same study the authors also investigated the uniaxial compression of H2O@C60 for an hexagon\u2013hexagon orientation. They reported a full dissociation of H2O into an oxidoannulene structure and two single C\u2013H bonds, at a strain of 0.57, with therefore an apparently different mechanism than for the pentagon\u2013pentagon compression.19 To compare with these findings, we also carried out 300 K MD simulations of the H2O@C60 compression for this orientation. Our results are shown in Fig. 6-(g-k). Up to \u03b5 = 0.55, the H2O molecule is observed to remain in the center of C60, a difference with the previous case being that it is tilted relatively to the compression plane (Fig. 6-h). At this strain the O atom carries an excess charge of about 1.0 e\u2212, and the H atoms a deficit of 0.2 e\u2212, similar to what is obtained for the pentagon\u2013pentagon orientation. Note that at this strain the C60 shell is already opened with no incidence on the molecule state (Fig. 6-i). When \u03b5 = 0.56, one hydrogen atom loosens and moves to make a bond with the C60 shell (Fig. 6-j). The remaining hydroxide ion also binds to C60, first with a single bond, then as an epoxide group after a few extra tenths of strain. Its charge is now approximately +0.4 e\u2212 (+1.0 e\u2212 for O and -0.6 e\u2212 for H), while the lone H atom carries a charge of -0.2 e\u2212. When \u03b5 = 0.61 the H\u2013O bond breaks, the hydrogen atom moving to make a bond with C60 (Fig. 6-k). At this strain, we find a charge deficit of 0.2 e\u2212 for both hydrogen atoms, and a charge excess of 0.4 e\u2212 for the oxygen atom. Increasing the compression leads to the breaking of the bond between the two carbon atoms bonded to the oxygen atom, and then the failure of the C60 shell. Finally the whole process is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to what we find for the pentagon\u2013pentagon compression. This suggests that the seemingly different behaviors reported by Sabirov and co-workers19 for the two compression orientations likely result from the use of large strain increments, preventing a detailed analysis of the structural transformations. It also confirms that it is possible to achieve a full dissociation of a single H2O molecule when encapsulated into a compressed fullerene.\nFinally we also find that the compression of CH4@C60 triggers a chemical transformation (see the Supplementary Material for a movie). Initially, the CH4 molecule is only weakly perturbed, with C\u2013H bond lengths of about 1.1 \u00c5 and H\u0302CH angles close to the expected value of 109.5\u25e6 (Fig. 6-l). The carbon atom carries approximately 0.4 e\u2212 in excess, whereas the hydrogen atoms are characterized by a charge deficit of 0.1 e\u2212. As compression proceeds, the C\u2013H bonds shorten to 1.07 \u00c5 and the H\u0302CH angles including the two top or the two bottom H atoms rise to a maximum of 133\u25e6 at \u03b5 = 0.41 (Fig. 6-m). In parallel there is a small 0.1 e\u2212 transfer from CH4 to C60. At \u03b5 = 0.42, the topmost H atom separates from the molecule C atom to form a bond with C60, and the remaining methyl radical binds to the C60 shell (Fig. 6- n). Associated energy and force reductions of 1.7 eV and 9.3 nN are calculated (Fig. 2). This mechanism implies a 0.2 e\u2212 transfer\nfrom the molecule carbon atom to C60, but no appreciable charge changes for the hydrogen atoms. Increasing the strain weakly reduces the bond lengths for the lone hydrogen and the methyl group. The excess charge on C60 and on the C atom increase to 0.55\u20130.6 e\u2212, whereas for the H atoms the charge deficit rises to 0.3 e\u2212. At \u03b5 = 0.51, the C60 shell yields by the breaking of carbon bonds in the equatorial region (Fig. 6-o), with no clear direct relation with the presence of the methyl group and the single hydrogen atom. Finally, we note that the carbon atom in CH3 binds to a second C60 shell atom at approximately \u03b5 = 0.55, before we stop the compression. The process as a whole appears to be similar to an earlier prediction.20 In this latter study, the strain at which the CH4\u2192CH3+H transformation takes place is reported to be 0.40, therefore in excellent agreement with the present value of 0.42."

            "text": "In this study the mechanical properties of various kinds of endofullerenes X@C60 were investigated by performing first principles molecular dynamics simulations of uniaxial compression over a large strain range. We considered realistic and synthesizable X systems, including single noble gas atoms, H2O or CH4 molecules, as well as artificial helium clusters. These calculations and the associated analyses lead to the following conclusions:\n\u2022 In the absence of strain, it is confirmed that the interactions between X and C60 are weak in most cases, with negligible modifications of structural properties and limited charge transfers. A light expansion of the C60 shell was obtained only in the case of encapsulated helium clusters.\n\u2022 In the elastic regime an increase of stiffness, proportional to the intrinsic volume of X, is predicted. However this increase is at most 12% of the C60 stiffness.\n\u2022 The presence or the nature of X has no noticeable influence on the yield strain and on the C60 shell yielding mechanisms. Still the variations of both the contact force and the energy clearly depend on X. For instance large increases of their values at yield are predicted.\n\u2022 The estimation of the volume of X and of a derived pressure shows that single noble gas atoms and small molecules could be put in a very high stress state, with pressure values in the range 50\u2013200 GPa, during the compression of endofullerenes.\n\u2022 The simulations confirm that the uniaxial compression could trigger the dissociation of H2O or CH4 when these molecules are encapsulated into C60.\nTo summarize, the uniaxial compression of X@C60 is predicted to have a strong effect on the properties of X, but a rather limited one on the mechanical properties of C60. This is mainly a consequence of our choice of closed-shell atoms or molecules for X, for which electronic interactions with the C60 shell are minimal. A natural an interesting continuation of this work would then be to consider endohedral metallofullerenes, where one or two metal atoms are enclosed in a fullerene.1 The usually strong interaction\n8 | 1 10Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nof these atoms with the fullerene shell is likely to influence its mechanical strength and yield mechanisms, defining a research topic worth to be explored.\nCon icts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare."
