    "abstractText": "We report the discovery of N-terminal alanine-rich sequences, which we term NTARs, that act in concert with their native 5 \u2032 -untranslated regions to promote selection of the proper start codon. NTARs also facilitate efficient translation initiation while limiting the production of non-functional polypeptides through leaky scanning. We first identified NTARs in the ERK1 / 2 kinases, which are among the most important signaling molecules in mammals. Analysis of the human proteome reveals that hundreds of proteins possess NTARs, with housekeeping proteins showing a particularly high prevalence. Our data indicate that several of these NTARs act in a manner similar to those found in the ERKs and suggest a mechanism involving some or all of the following features: alanine richness, codon rarity, a repeated amino acid stretch and a nearby second AUG. These features may help slow down the leading ribosome, causing trailing pre-initiation complexes (PICs) to pause near the native AUG, thereby facilitating accurate translation initiation. Amplification of erk genes is frequently observed in cancer, and we show that NTARdependent ERK protein levels are a rate-limiting step for signal output. Thus, NTAR-mediated control of translation may reflect a cellular need to precisely control translation of key transcripts such as potential oncogenes. By preventing translation in alterna-",

NTARs also facilitate efficient translation initiation while limiting the production of non-functional polypeptides through leaky scanning. We first identified NTARs in the ERK1 / 2 kinases, which are among the most important signaling molecules in mammals. Analysis of the human proteome reveals that hundreds of proteins possess NTARs, with housekeeping proteins showing a particularly high prevalence. Our data indicate that several of these NTARs act in a manner similar to those found in the ERKs and suggest a mechanism involving some or all of the following features: alanine richness, codon rarity, a repeated amino acid stretch and a nearby second AUG. These features may help slow down the leading ribosome, causing trailing pre-initiation complexes (PICs) to pause near the native AUG, thereby facilitating accurate translation initiation. Amplification of erk genes is frequently observed in cancer, and we show that NTARdependent ERK protein levels are a rate-limiting step for signal output. Thus, NTAR-mediated control of translation may reflect a cellular need to precisely control translation of key transcripts such as potential oncogenes.

Nearly all stud-\nes have focused on ERK activation as the primary mechnism through which its downstream effects are maniested. Howe v er, decreased ERK quantity can also modlate downstream signaling, as has been shown with alered wing de v elopment in Drosophila when deficient splicng reduces dERK quantity ( 6 ). In mice, combinations of RK1 and / or ERK2 knockouts trigger increasingly deleerious phenotypes due to decreased total ERK quantity re vie wed in ( 7 )]. In humans, children lacking one erk2 alele display minor neurological disorders ( 8 ). These studies uggest that a threshold of ERK quantity may be necesary for regulation of kinase activity by MEK and phoshatases. Increased ERK quantity resulting from erk2 gene mplification, which can confer resistance to chemotherapy 9 ), was demonstrated to occur frequently in lung cancers 10 ); according to the datasets available in the Tissue Caner Genome Atlas (TCGA), both erk1 and erk2 are amplied in many cancers including bladder and non-small cell ung cancer (NSCLC) ( 11 ). With the goal of further clariying the role of ERK quantity in regulating downstream ignaling, we first assessed pathway activation using a clasical reporter of ERK activity, the GAL4\u2013ELK / gal4\u2013luc ystem ( 12 ). In addition, we studied the phosphorylation attern of an ELK chimera ( 13 ), because the progressi v e ulti-phosphorylation of transcription factors constitutes molecular switch for cell fate decisions dri v en by ERK 14 ). Here, we show that the quantity of ERK, but not he quantity of MEK, the kinase immediately upstream, mpacts signaling. This observation led us to explore the\nechanisms regulating ERK quantity. We focused our atention on the N-terminus (Nt) of ERK1 / 2, which conain an unusual alanine-rich tract. In the context of erk1 or rk2 promoters / 5 \u2032 -untranslated region (UTR), we discovred that ERK Nts dri v e ele vated protein synthesis of funcional ERKs by allowing precise and efficient start codon election.\nA short RNA sequence flanking the initiation codon, ermed the Kozak sequence ( 15 ), dri v es start codon selecion in mammals. Some mRNAs harbor se v eral AUGs in heir 5 \u2032 -UTRs, and switching start codon selection from the ati v e AUG [i.e. the one that sets the main open reading rame (ORF)] to an upstream A UG (uA UG) is known to egulate biological responses such as resistance to amino cid starvation ( 16 , 17 ). Alternati v ely, the nati v e AUG can e skipped and downstream AUGs may be selected to tart translation, a process termed \u2018leaky scanning\u2019 ( 18 ). We how that in the absence of its own Nt-coding sequence, ranslation of erk mRNA led to production of shorter, on-functional polypeptides via leaky scanning, starting at ownstream AUGs. The action of ERK Nts is restricted to pecific 5 \u2032 -UTRs, suggesting that various rules govern start odon selection.\nSe v eral hundreds to a few thousand human proeins display N-terminal alanine-rich sequences (NTARs) imilar to those of ERK1 / 2. We further demonstrated hat the NTARs of PABPN1, TRIM28, MECP2 and IPA1 are required for the high expression of a funcional reporter protein in the context of their proxi-\nal promoter / 5 \u2032 UTR, similar to what we found for RK1 / 2. Studying the mechanism by which NTARs regulate ranslation may provide tools to understand physioathological conditions such as polyalanine expansion disrders. In this family of diseases, protein synthesis is altered y the presence of alanine repeats that are orders of magitude greater than those found in ERK1 / 2 ( 19 ). Hence, tudying the much shorter ERK Nts may help to decipher he molecular processes at play in these diseases. The speific regulation of ERK quantity by NTAR sequences may ffer new perspectives to fight cancer because nearly 40% of ll human cancers display ov eracti vation of the ERK pathay, including ERK ov ere xpression ( 10 ). It might also be elpful in de v eloping therapies against RASopathies, a famly of diseases originating from germline mutations of proeins that occupy different positions along the ERK signalng pathway ( 20 ).\nATERIALS AND METHODS\nr oximal pr omoters and Nt sequences were assembled by olden Gate cloning which r equir es entry plasmids with\nanamycin selection and assembly plasmids with ampicillin election ( 21 ).\nntry plasmids for Golden Gate cloning\nhe entry vector was deri v ed from the pCRII-topo plasid (Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen). The BsaI site in the ampi-\nillin gene of the pCRII-topo plasmid was inactivated by oint mutation (new sequence agcgtgggtc A cgcggt), then t was cut by XmnI and ScaI restriction enzymes (REs) nd religated to remove amp R (the plasmid remained ana R ). The following sequence was cloned between the wo BstXI sites: gaa ttcAggcctga tttaaa ta ttcccggga ta tcacgtgaattcaagctt, introducing a stretch of restriction sites for lunt REs (StuI, SwaI, SspI, SmaI, EcoRV and PmlI) beween two EcoRI sites for diagnostic purposes. The resultng plasmid was named Empal-Blunt (manuscript in prepaation).\nFragments of promoter regions were amplified by polyerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers containing BsaI ites at their extremities, such that upon cutting by BsaI, cohesi v e fragment is released with non-palindromic exremities. High fidelity enzymes produced blunt-end PCR roducts that were cloned directly into the plasmid Empallunt kanaR after mixing the purified PCR fragment with the mpal-Blunt plasmid in the presence of a blunt-end RE that oes not cut the fragment. Incubation was done with cyles of temperature, from the optimal temperature for ligtion to the optimal temperature for RE digestion (Suplementary Table S2, tab5). Minipreps from white colonies ere sequenced to ensure the integrity of the expected fragents bordered by BsaI sites. PCR was performed using he KOD hot-start enzyme [Merck Millipore Toyobo ref 1086- ( 4 )], the Q5 hot-start enzyme (New England Biolabs, 0493S) or the Phusion hot-start enzyme (Finnzymes F40L). For high GC-rich sequences, 3% dimethylsulfoxide DMSO) was added. Typical r eactions ar e listed in Suppleentary Table S2.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nAssembly plasmids for Golden Gate cloning\nAssembly plasmids harboring either firefly luciferase (ffLuc) with a vPEST sequence (luc2P) or the catalytic domain of mouse ERK1 were deri v ed from pGL4 fr om Pr omega bought fr om Switchgear (pSGG-Basic3 \u2032 GAPDH).\npSGG-GG-luc2P and pSGG-GG-lucHA. pSGG-Basic3 \u2032 GAPDH harbors the RPLP10 promoter upstream of Luc2P (ffLuc with PEST sequences) with the 3 \u2032 -UTR of human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) downstream. Firstly, the BsaI site in 3 \u2032 GAPDH was mutated into the BsmBI site by overlap extension PCR with external primers PL-09\u201358 and PL-09\u201359 and mutagenesis primers PL-12\u201358 and PL-12\u201359 (sequences of primers in Supplementary Table S2, tab2). The resulting plasmid is called pSGG-Basic. Secondly, a fragment comprising the RPLP10 promoter downstream from KpnI, up to the BsrGI inside luc2P, was replaced by a PCR fragment with primers PL-09\u201357 and PL-12\u201339 encompassing the Nt sequence of luc2P (into KpnI and BsrGI); the resulting plasmid has no promoter upstream of luc2P but instead it has two BsaI sites (GGT CT C) in opposite orientation: accg aGAGACCtgtacaGGT CT Cg gaag . This vector, named pSGG-GG-Luc2P, allows cloning of fragments into the non-palindromic sites accg and gaag upon cutting by BsaI RE. On the 3 \u2032 cohesi v e end, gaa is the second codon of luc2P (glutamic acid).\nFor immunoblotting, the PEST sequence of luc2P was replaced by the hemagglutinin (HA) tag. A PCR fragment from luc2P as template was obtained with primers PL-16-11 and PL-16-27 (harboring the sequence of the HA tag). This fragment cut by BsaI was inserted into the AgeI and XbaI sites of plasmid pSGG-GG-luc2P to generate the plasmid pSGG-GG-lucHA (the same BsaI RE sites upstream of ffLuc for cloning).\npSGG-mERK1. A PCR product containing the mouse ERK1 coding sequence (primers PL-16-28 and PL-16-29; BsmBI external cloning sites) was inserted between the KpnI and XbaI sites of plasmid pSGG-Basic-3 \u2032 GAPDH. The sequences of promoter RPLP10 and luc2P were replaced by mERK1 with two upstream BsaI sites in opposite orientation: ac cg aGAGACCtgtacaGGT CT Cg gaag . On the 3 \u2032 cohesi v e end of this sequence, the gaa codon corresponds to glutamic acid of mERK1 at sequence E VVKG. The glutamic acid was chosen to be able to use the same cloning strategy for pSGG-GG-luc2P and pSGG-GG-ERK1.\nAssemb ly str ategy. Golden Ga te assembly was performed in a single tube; se v er al fr agment-bearing plasmids (in Empal-Blunt, Kana R ) were mixed with pSGG-GG-luc2P (Amp R ) in the presence of BsaI and T4 DNA ligase. When needed, annealed oligonucleotides were added at a final concentration of 40 ng each. In a thermocycler, incubation cycles switched from the best temperature for the RE (37 \u25e6C or 55 \u25e6C) to the best temperature for T4 ligase (16 \u25e6C) overnight. A typical reaction is presented in Supplementary Ta ble S2, ta b 5. This file also includes all the primers used to clone the proximal promoters or the 5 \u2032 -UTRs and oligonucleotides annealed to generate all constructs. Golden Gate\ncloning allowed us to assemble up to four fragments at once with high ef ficiency. Transforma tion was performed in NEB-stable bacteria (cat. # C3040). Amp R colonies were screened and subsequently sequenced.\nExisting plasmids and ERK1 truncations\nFor Figure 1 , Chinese hamster HA-MEK1-WT and HAMEK1-SSDD (S218D-S222-D) were described previously ( 22 ). HA-ERK-WT plasmid harbors Chinese hamster wildtype ERK1 in the same plasmid backbone (pECE) as HAMEK1-WT ( 23 ). RAF1-WT and RAF1-CAAX were described previously ( 24 ). For other figures, mouse ERK1 was used, deri v ed from mouse HA-mERK1 ( 25 ). pGAL4ELK and 5 \u00d7-gal4-ffLuciferase were cited previously ( 26 ). For immunob lotting, My c-tag was added to GAL4(1\u2013146)\u2013 linker(PVEL)\u2013hELK1-307\u2013428) by PCR with primers PL19-56 and PL-19-57, and the fr agment gener ated by BsaI cutting was assembled with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter fragment (PCR primers PL-18-69 and PL-18-12) into pSGG-GG-luc2P cut by BsaI / XbaI. The CMV promoter was amplified from plasmid pCRHL. The final vector is called pSGG-GAL4-ELK-myc (ELK-myc).\nPlasmids expressing catalytic mouse ERK or truncations of mouse ERK1 behind the CMV promoter were generated into a psgg vector, with an ACCG cohesive site in 5 \u2032 (BsaI) and a CTAG cohesi v e site in 5 \u2032 (XbaI). The CMV promoter was amplified with primers PL-18-08 and PL-1969. The ERK fragments were generated by PL-16-29 in 3 \u2032 , producing a CTAG site by BsmBI cutting. In 5 \u2032 , the catalytic mERK1 was amplified with primer PL-19-69; the second inframe AUG with PL-19-70; the third AUG in-frame with PL-19-71; and the fourth AUG in-frame with PL-19-72, all producing an ACCG cohesi v e site by BsmBI cutting. Note tha t ca talytic mouse ERK1 starts here with the sequence MGEVEVVK. Two fragments were assembled at once in the vector cut by XbaI and BsaI."

A genomic fragment encompassing the mouse erk2 (m- erk2 ) promoter was amplified with primers PL-09-47 and PL-09-48. The m- erk2 promoter has three BsaI sites, hence the assembly was carried out by overlap PCR between the promoter and luc2P. For assembly with the Nt moiety, a fragment of the erk2 promoter was amplified by primers PL-09-62 and PL-09-63, and the luc2P fragment was amplified by primers PL-09-64 and PL-09-57. External primers were then used to generate an assembled fragment that was cloned into the plasmid pSGG-Basic in the KpnI and BsrG1 RE sites. For assembly without the Nt, a fragment of the erk2 promoter was amplified with primers PL-09-62 and PL-09-65, the luc2P fragment was amplified with primers PL-09-66 and PL-09-57, and the same strategy was used with external primers.\nMouse erk1 promoter.

The m- erk1 proximal promoter was initially ssembled with ffLuc by overlap PCR; the external primer n erk1 is PL-09-54 and on luc2P it is PL-09-57. For asembly in the presence of the ERK1 Nt, the internal reerse primer was PL-09-55 on erk1 and the internal sense rimer on luc2P was PL-09-56. For assembly in the absence f the ERK1 Nt, the internal re v erse primer of erk1 was L-09-60 and the internal sense primer on luc2P was PL9-61. To compare the Kozak sequences in the presence or bsence of the Nt, refer to the alignment in Supplementary igure S8. The proximal promoter of mouse erk1 harbors wo BsaI sites that were subsequently mutated to facilitate ssembly of all the modified sequences: \u2013163 G to C and 536 A to T. No difference was observed with promE1 WT ersus promE1 BsaImut when comparing the presence or abence of the ERK1 Nt sequence (not shown). Ther efor e, all esults pr esented her e ar e with the m- erk1 promoter with he two point mutations on BsaI sites. For Figures 2 B and A, the m- erk1 promoter (fragment amplified with primers L-13-02 and PL-13-63) was assembled with fragment NtRK1 (obtained with primers PL-12-40 and PL-12-41) r with Nt-ERK2 (annealed with primers PL-12-42 and L-12-43).\numan hstk promoter. The hstk minimal promoter was reonstituted from the pRL-TK plasmid sequence (Promega). pstream primer PL-13-27 on the thymidine kinase (TK) romoter was combined with a long re v erse primer PL-159 for PCR. Primer PL-15-69 reconstitutes the human hstk inimal promoter as it is present in sequence JQ673480.1 f GenBank [human herpesvirus 1 (HSV) strain KOS, comlete genome]. For luciferase assays, this WT hstk prooter fragment was amplified with PL-13-27 and PL-159 primers to insert the promoter alone upstream of luc2P, r with PL-13-27 and PL-15-70 to be assembled with Ntoding sequences, such as annealed primer PL-16-06 / 07 to dd the HSTK Nt or annealed primers PL-12-42 / 43 to add he ERK2 Nt.\numan kras promoter. The plasmid containing the human ras pr oximal pr omoter was cloned fr om genomic DNA rom human Beas-2b cells with primers PL-15-73 and PL5-74. To shunt exon0, kras promoter fragments upstream f exon0 were amplified with primers that reconstitute the ati v e ATG after exon0: PL-16-00 and PL-16-01, PL-16-00 nd PL-16-02, or PL-16-00 and primer PL-16-08. The fragent PL-16-00 / PL-16-01 contains the kras promoter alone o be cloned into pSGG-GG-luc2P. The fragment PL-160 / PL-16-02 allows cloning of the annealed primers PL-122 / 43 to assemble the ERK2 Nt after the AUG. The fragent PL-16-00 / PL-16-08 includes the promoter kras with ts nati v e Nt moiety (size of Nt-ERK2). Note: for final assembly, it was necessary to re-assemble he promoter after the first Golden Gate cloning step into he plasmid pSGG-GG-luc2P because the kras promoter as three BsaI RE sites (\u2013649, \u2013794 and \u2013891). As the cohei v e ends of these three BsaI sites are non-palindromic, they an assemble in the right order. Ther efor e, after Golden ate assembly, BsaI was inactivated by 20 min at 80 \u25e6C, then 4 ligase and ATP (0.5 mM) were added for 10 min at 16 \u25e6C\nnd 30 min at 25 \u25e6C to ligate promoter fragments. The fullength h- kras minimal promoter was readily obtained.\nouse trim28 promoter. The proximal promoter of trim28 as amplified from mouse genomic DNA with primers PL9-41 and PL-19-43 (size 1965 bp). Then the proximal prooter was amplified with 5 \u2032 primer PL-19\u201348 and with 3 \u2032 rimers PL-19-45 (proximal promoter alone 886 bp), PL9-46 (promoter with 180 nucleotides of coding sequence) r PL-19-47 (promoter with 342 nucleotides of coding equence).\numan nipa1 promoter. The proximal promoter of nipa1 as amplified from human genomic DNA from normal huan foreskin fibroblasts with primers PL-22-98 and PL2-100 (size 1550 bp). Then the pr oximal pr omoter was mplified with 5 \u2032 primer PL-22-101 and 3 \u2032 primers PL2-103 (pr oximal pr omoter alone), PL-22-102 (pr omoter ith 81 nucleotides of coding sequence) or PL-22-104 (prooter with ATGG cohesi v e site). With the fragments PL2-101 / PL-22-104, a fragment lacking the first two amino cids of the Nt was assembled (PL-22-105 and PL-22-102). s an inadvertent BsaI site was present inside the promoter, fter inactivation of the Golden Gate enzymes, ATP and ligse were added for 1 h to close back the plasmids prior to ransformation of bacteria.\numan mecp2 promoter. The pr oximal pr omoter of mecp2 as amplified from human genomic DNA from normal huan foreskin fibroblasts with primers PL-22-07 and PL-220 (size 2324 bp). Then the proximal promoter was amlified with 5 \u2032 primer PL-22-13 and with 3 \u2032 primers PL2-15 (proximal promoter alone 969 bp), PL-22-21 (prooter with 63 nucleotides of coding sequence) or PL-22-22 promoter for adding annealed primers). To this last fragent, primers PL-22-23 / PL-22-26 were annealed to change odon sequences to GCG, or primers PL-22-24 / PL-22-27 o change codon sequences to GCA-GCT.\npecific strategies for individual figures\nite-dir ected mutag enesis of the second AUG of mERK1 and fLuc. The second AUGs were converted to GUG by the ethod of Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis from NEB. The\nrimers were designed by the NEB-tool changer (primers L-22-68 and PL-22-69 for ffLuc and primers PL-22-70 and L-22-71 for mERK1; sequences in Supplementary Table 2), For each protein, site-directed mutagenesis was per-\normed only on the GG vector (pSGG-mERK1 and pSGGG-lucHA); after sequence verification, in these vectors asembly of the erk1 promoter with its 5 \u2032 -UTR was generted by Golden Gate cloning with the fragments PL-132 / PL-13-59 and PL-13-58 / PL-19-100, PL-13-58 / PL-134 or PL-13-58 / PL-12-41 to generate proteins without their rst AUG, without or with the ERK1 Nt. The mutagenesis as performed from 1 l of the Q5 PCR performed accordng to the manufacturer\u2019s conditions, then 20 U of DpnI, 00 U of T4 DNA ligase and 10 U of T4 polynucleotide kiase were added in a final volume of 20 l with T4 DNA igase buffer, and incubated at 10 min cycles from 37 \u25e6C o 25 \u25e6C overnight prior to transformation into competent\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nBicistronic vector to assemble erk1 5 \u2032 -UTRs of various sizes. To determine the size of the erk1 5 \u2032 -UTR that dri v es start codon choice with the ERK1 Nt, a plasmid pSGG-renillaluciferase-GG-ffLuc w as constructed. PCR w as performed from plasmid pCRHL ( 27 ) to obtain the CMV promoter upstream of Renilla luciferase (R-Luc). To remove the BsaI site at the end of this CMV promoter, a fragment of the CMV promoter was amplified by primers PL-17-36 and PL17-80 to be joined with the fragment of R-Luc which was amplified with primers PL-17-81 and PL-17-88. These fragments, cut by BsmBI, were inserted into the plasmid pSGGGG-luc2P between KpnI and BsaI sites. The final plasmid had two BsaI sites between R-Luc and the ffLuc, with the BsaI cohesi v e e xtremities: A CCG and GAAG , with GAA being the second codon of ffLuc. The control FGF-1A internal ribosome entry site (IRES) fragment (441 bp) with only the erk1 Kozak context was generated by PCR from the vector pCRF-1AL with the primers Pl-17-42 and PL17-91. The FGF-1A IRES fragment to be assembled with fragments of the erk1 5 \u2032 -UTR was generated by PCR from the vector pCRF-1AL with the primers Pl-17-42 and PL17-44. Fragments with erk1 5 \u2032 -UTRs of increasing size were generated with 5 \u2032 primers (sense): PL-17-89; PL-17-109; PL17-108; PL-13-85 and PL-13-58; the 3 \u2032 primer (re v erse) was either PL-13-16 to gener ate fr agments without the Nt or PL-12-41 to add the ERK1 Nt sequence.\nAssembly of various Kozak sequences. To assemble the different Kozak sequences between the erk1 proximal promoter and the luc2P coding sequence, in the presence or absence of the ERK2 Nt moiety, the erk1 promoter was truncated in 3 \u2032 . This fragment was generated by PCR with primers PL-13-02 and PL-14-120. To evaluate Kozak contexts in the absence of the ERK2 Nt, the following annealed primers were assembled with the promoter fragment: PL15-24 / 25; PL-14-118 / 119; PL-15-12 / 13; PL-15-14 / 15; and PL-15-16 / 17 (order of Figure 4 B). To evaluate Kozak contexts in the presence of the ERK2 Nt sequence, the following annealed primers were assembled with the promoter\u2019s fragment: PL-15-26 / 27; PL-15-01 / 02; PL-15-06 / 07; PL-1508 / 09; and PL-15\u201310 / 11 (order of Figure 4 B).\nExperiments with two AUGs in a defined environment. In Figure 4 A and B, two AUGs, within defined contexts, are separated by spacers. We chose to use the Nt of ffLuc as a template for spacers. All four spacers were obtained by PCR from the plasmid pSGG-GG-luc2P, then they were cloned into the ACCG and GAAG sites of this vector cut by BsaI. In 5 \u2032 , the four PCR products possess the Golden Gate sites of the pSGG-GG-luc2P vector. As a result of inserting the PCR products into the v ector (cohesi v e ends generated by BsmBI cutting), the N-terminus of ffLuc is now duplicated, the copy / spacer being placed between the BsaI Golden Gate sites and a second AUG in the reading frame of the full-length ffLuc protein. The four PCR spacers differ in the environment of this second AUG. All previous cloning strategies can be performed in the ACCG / GAAG sites by BsaI. In 5 \u2032 , all spacers were amplified by the forward primer PL-22-108. The spacer with a canonical Kozak sequence (GCCGCCACC-ATG) or a poor Kozak sequence (CTT AT ATT A-ATG) upstream of the second AUG were\namplified in 3 \u2032 by the primers PL-22-111 and PL-22-112, respecti v ely. These two spacers introduce 69 nucleotides between the two AUGs (in final constructions lacking th eERK Nt). The 3 \u2032 primers PL-22-109 and PL-22-113 produced spacers with the second AUG in the second or third r eading frames, r especti v ely. In those cases, there are 70 or 71 nucleotides between the two AUGs (in final constructions lacking the ERK Nt). Please note that the Kozak contexts of these AUGs in alternative frames (with respect to the first AUG) are nearly close to the canonical sequences (only 1G at \u20139 is missing): CCGCCACC-ATG. All eight AUGs have Kozak contexts with a G +4 .\nChanging the nucleotide sequence of the ERK2 Nt moiety. For Figure 6 C, se v er al PCR fr agments of the mouse erk1 promoter were used for Golden Gate assembly as presented in Supplementary Table S2. Promoter erk1 amplified from primers PL-13-02 and PL-14-120 was assembled with annealed primers PL-15-57 / 58 or PL-15-59 / 60 to generate promoter erk1 with one or two alanines, respecti v ely, in the Nt fused to luc2P. Promoter erk1 amplified from primers PL-13-02 and PL-13-63 was assembled with annealed primers PL-15-32 / 33 or PL-15-30 / 31 to generate promoter erk1 with three alanines in the Nt fused to luc2P, or with the six alanine codons switched to GCC codons in the Nt. Promoter erk1 amplified from primers PL-13-02 and PL-13-11 was assembled with annealed primers PL-1342 / 43, PL-13-46 / 47, PL-13-64 / 65, PL-14-01 / 02 or PL-1319 / 20 to generate promoter erk1 with an Nt with only six alanines (absence of glycine\u2013proline\u2013glutamic acid after the stretch of alanines), an Nt shifted by one nucleotide, by two nucleotides or by three nucleotides, or with the codons of the ERK2 Nt switched to codons GCA / T.\nAdding a second AUG 3 \u2032 adjacent to the Nt sequence. For Figure 4 C, erk1 promoter was amplified with primers PL-13-02 and PL-13-63; this fragment was assembled into pSGG-GG-lucHA with annealed primers PL-20-19 / 20 with a second ATG (after the ERK2 Nt sequence), or with primers PL-20-21 / 22 or PL-20-23 / 24 with GTG or GTC after the ERK2 Nt sequence instead of ATG."

The protein coding sequence and 12 nucleotides upstr eam wer e e xported and conv erted to singlelane Fasta format. Each sequence was segmented into the Kozak sequence (9 nucleotides) and the first 39 coding nucleotides. Coding sequences were translated and the Swissprot number was conca tena ted with its translated coding sequence (13 amino acids). Duplicates were removed, dropping entries from 99K to \u223c23K. This strategy allows entries with the same accession number but different Nt-coding sequences to be scrutinized. The sum of alanine residues and glycine residues among the sequence of 13 amino acids was calculated. The frequency of each of the four alanine codons was determined among the first six amino acid positions. This size was chosen because it is the size of the ERK2 alanine stretch that was demonstrated to provide full effect. Ranking of proteins was determined arbitrarily according to the following rules: 30 points gi v en if the second amino acid is alanine; 25 points per alanine in the third or fourth position; 3 points per alanine in the fifth to sixth position; 2 points per alanine in the se v enth to ninth position; and 1 point per alanine in the 10th to 13th position. To this number, the total number of alanine residues among the first 13 amino acids is added. The first protein in the list has 11 alanines out of 13; beyond the protein ranked in position 15 370, no alanine residues are present in the Nt (overall, 7923 proteins in the list have no alanine in their first 13 amino acids). From this list, families of proteins were sorted, such as the 85 proteins harboring a canonical Kozak sequence (Supplementary Table S1), or proteins harboring at least a stretch of six consecuti v e Nt alanines (Supplementary Figure S5B). For searching the presence of housekeeping genes (HKGs) in groups of 500 proteins, the list of HKGs was downloaded from the protein atlas w e b site in 2021:\nhttps://www.pr oteinatlas.org/humanpr oteome/tissue/ housekeeping and searching was operated by the Excel form ula VL OOKUP. A similar procedure was done with the list of HKGs in the supplementary materials of the publication of Eisenberg and Levanon ( 30 )."

            "text": "Both ERK activity and quantity play crucial roles in ERK signaling\nWe studied the relevance of ERK quantity on the ERK cascade signal output using the GAL4-ELK / gal4 -luc system in which the production of ffLuc increases when the chimeric GAL4-ELK protein is phosphorylated by ERK. Then, we evaluated the consequences of increasing the quantity of WT or constituti v ely acti v e kinases.\nUsing transfected HeLa cells, we confirmed that either a constituti v ely acti v e RAF1 mutant, i.e. RAF1-CAAX, or a constituti v ely acti v e MEK mutant, i.e. MEK-SSDD, strongly increased ffLuc activity in a dose-dependent manner compared with their respecti v e WT forms or with WTERK (Figure 1 A).\ni i i s w s E m t t p ( R i E S m s e v I E\nT\nE r F E i a p 3 p t t s t e d o i E o m\ni t a m I s c i o 2 c c m 1\ni i N 4 l b p m\nT s\nC t E f s u c ( E v l ( f t p\nr a w z \u223c u s a H l d t p p l p s t d i u w ( w o r u c t\nt n o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nIn cells with constituti v ely acti v e RAF1-CAAX, increasng amounts of WT-ERK further induced a dose-dependent ncrease in ffLuc activity, which was not seen with increasng quantities of WT-MEK (Figure 1 B). This result strongly uggests that under persistent activation of the ERK pathay, only ERK quantity is rate limiting. To confirm this oberva tion, phosphoryla tion of a chimera of ELK, a direct RK substrate, was measured by immunoblotting. Basal yc-tagged ELK phosphorylation was fully inhibited in he presence of the MEK inhibitor PD184352, whereas in he presence of RAF1-CAAX the multi-phosphorylation rofile of ELK shifted to higher molecular weight bands Supplementary Figure S1). Under this basal activation by AF1-CAAX, increasing amounts of WT-ERK led to an ncrease in phospho-ERK le v els as well as the increase in LK phosphorylation (Figure 1 C; Supplementary Figure 1). The ELK expression pattern mostly mimics the ELK ulti-phosphorylation profile. Thus, in the context of contituti v e acti va tion of the ERK pa thway, increasing ERK xpression not only increases the intensity of ELK actiation but also changes its multi-phosphorylation profile. n contrast, incr easing expr ession of MEK induced neither RK nor ELK phosphorylation (Figure 1 C).\nhe ERK Nt impacts ERK signaling\nRK1 and ERK2 are both ubiquitously expressed and eadily detected by immunoblotting in cell lines and tissues. urthermore, quantitati v e proteomic analysis indicates that RKs are among the most expressed kinases. For example, n NIH3T3 cells, only CDK1 and a few metabolic kinases r e mor e highly expr essed than ERK2, while ERK1 is exressed in the range of MEK1 or MEK2 (ERK2 being the 75th most expressed protein in this cell model) ( 31 ). In a anel of 32 human tissues, the quantity of ERK quantity is han that of MEK in 90% of multiple samples ( 32 ). To beter understand the basis of elevated ERK1 / 2 expression, we tudied erk promoters and the role of ERK Nt sequences hat are highly G / C rich similarly to both 5 \u2032 -UTRs. It is asy to distinguish the ERK Nt moieties from the catalytic omain because, after their first shared glutamic acid (E 12 f ERK2, E 29 of ERK1), human ERK1 and ERK2 are 83% dentical ( 33 ). Although the ERK1 Nt is twice as long as the RK2 Nt (29 versus 12 amino acids), both include a stretch f Ala GCG codons immediately downstream of the initiating ethionine (Met i ) (Figure 2 A). To investigate a putati v e role for ERK Nts in regulatng ERK signaling, the GAL4-ELK / gal4-luc reporter sysem was transfected along with increasing quantities of n ERK1-encoding construct, containing its proximal prooter in the absence or presence of its Nt (Figure 2 B). n the presence of RAF1-CAAX alone, ffLuc activity was timulated 20-fold compared with the basal le v el, while inreasing quantities of ERK1 further induced ERK signalng in a dose-dependent manner. Howe v er, in the absence f the ERK1 Nt, signaling output was decreased (Figure B). We then investigated whether the absence of the Nt ould alter ERK1 kinase activity. Because there is a direct orrelation between ERK activity and the extent of ELK ulti-phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S1; Figure C), we co-transfected HeLa cells with ELK and increas-\nng quantities of ERK1 with or without its Nt. As shown n Figure 2 C, when similar amounts of full-ERK1 (with the\nt) or catalytic-ERK1 (without theNt) wer e expr essed (lane versus lane 7), the activation levels of ELK were simiar, either when measured by an anti-phospho-ELK antiody or by observing the molecular weight shift of multihosphorylated myc-ELK. Ther efor e, the ERK1 Nt doain does not play a role in ERK-specific kinase activity.\nhe ERK Nt increases ERK quantity and reduces the syntheis of smaller polypeptides\nells were transiently transfected to assess the ability of he ERK Nt domains to regulate ERK quantity, catalyticRK1, under the control of the nati v e erk1 promoter and used or not to the ERK1 or ERK2 Nt (Figure 2 D). As hown by the phospho-ERK and ERK-HA profiles (Figre 2 D, first four lanes), ERK-HA proteins displayed an inreased molecular weight when the Nt moieties were present +29 amino acids for ERK1 and +12 amino acids for RK2, red arrows of Figure 2 D, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4 ersus lane 2). Mutation of the nati v e start codon to GUG ed to lack of ERK1 expression (lane 1). Phosphorylated functional) HA-tagged ERK proteins with Nt extensions rom either ERK1 or ERK2 were \u223c4-fold more abundant han those lacking the Nt (red arrows of Figure 2 D, lower anel, lanes 3 and 4 versus 2). Initial detection of transfected ERK-HA by immunoblot e v ealed bands of lower molecular weight expressed at varib le le v els. Here, to maximize detection of these bands, cells er e tr eated overnight with the proteasome inhibitor borteomib. A major low molecular weight band was expressed at 43 kDa (Figure 2 D, upper panel, #1). These lower moleclar weight bands (from #1 to #5) are unlikely to correpond to degradation products, firstly because they are less bundant under conditions of strong expression of full-size A-tagged ERK proteins (upper panel, lanes 3 and 4 versus anes 1 and 2), and secondly because they are more abunant w hen catal ytic-ERK1 is not expressed due to a mua ted AUG initia tion codon (lane 1). The ERK1 Nt apear ed mor e efficient than the ERK2 Nt in reducing exression of the lower molecular weight bands (lane 3 versus ane 4). We ther efor e hypothesized that they correspond to roducts translated by leaky scanning from in-frame downtr eam AUGs. Ther efor e, we sought to compare the size of hese low molecular weight proteins with polypeptides prouced from either the second, third or fourth downstream n-frame AUG codons (sequences in Supplementary Figre S2A). The truncated forms of the catalytic ERK-HA er e expr essed at higher le v els using the CMV promoter lane 5 versus lane 2) because smaller quantities of plasmids ere transfected. The main bands produced from the secnd, third or fourth AUG (Figure 2 D, lanes 6, 7 and 8) coresponded to the sizes of the putati v e leaky scanning prodcts (#1, #2 and #3 bands). Only proteins that included the atalytic moiety of ERK1 were phosphorylated and thus aciv ated b y MEK (lanes 2\u20135, lower panel).\nTo confirm that the smaller polypeptides observed in he absence of the Nt moiety corresponded to leaky scaning products, we deleted the second in-frame AUG codon f ERK1 by mutating A 166 to G (M66V).

The top panel shows expression of HSP90 as a loading control, the second panel shows expression of ERK1-HA and HA-MEK, the third panel reveals phosphorylated ERKs (ectopic and endogenous), and the fourth and fifth panels show the profile of total myc-tagged GAL4-ELK and the multi-phosphorylated GAL4-ELK profile.

One day post-transfection, cells were treated overnight with 100 nM bortezomib to decrease proteasome-mediated protein degradation, then cells were stimulated for 15 min with 0.1 M orthovanadate prior to lysis to increase detection of phosphorylated ERK. The first four constructs were expressed under the erk1 promoter (lanes 1\u20134). ERK1 was expressed from either a mutated AUG (GUG, lane 1) or a normal AUG initiation codon (lanes 2\u20134). Nt domains of ERK1 or ERK2 were fused to catalytic ERK1 (lanes 3 and 4). Truncated ERK1 forms were expressed under the CMV promoter (lanes 5\u20138). Of note, lanes 5\u20138 were transfected with 18-fold less plasmid than lanes 1\u20134 (CMV versus ERK1 promoter). Lane 5 shows catalytic ERK1, whereas lanes 6\u20138 show polypeptides starting at the second, third or fourth in-frame AUG codons. Red arrows indicate the full-length ERK1-HA proteins. In lanes 1\u20134, smaller polypeptides expressed under the erk1 promoter are indicted by decreasing sizes (#1 to #5) on the left of the upper blot.

Small molecular weight polypeptides expressing the HA-tag are indicated on the left (#1 and #2). Arrows indicate functional ffLuc-HA at the expected size.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nigure 2 E, in the absence of the first AUG or in the abence of the Nt moiety, a band of smaller molecular weight as observed (Figure 2 E, control lanes 1 and 2, band #1). hen the second AUG of ERK1 was mutated (Figure 2 E, anes 4 and 5), this band disa ppeared, w hile expression of ower molecular weight bands slightly increased (#2 and 3). In the presence of the ERK1 Nt, only the full-length rotein was expressed, independently of the status of the econd in-frame AUG (WT or mutant, Figure 2 E, lanes and 6, respecti v el y). Taken to gether, these data suggest hat the presence of Nt domains ensures the synthesis of ull-length functional ERK proteins while inhibiting the exression of shorter polypeptides from downstream AUGs hrough leaky scanning.\nir efly lucifer ase r eporter gene r ecapitulates the action of RK-Nts\ne next tested whether the ERK Nt downstream of the RK1 promoter and 5 \u2032 -UTR pre v ented leaky scanning to dditional proteins such as the reporter ffLuc. We transected NIH3T3 cells with constructs that fuse the ERK1 Nt r the ERK2 Nt to ffLuc. Compared with the absence of t, such constructs demonstrated increased luciferase acivity by \u223c10-fold (Figure 3 A, upper panel). Even though he mouse erk2 pr oximal pr omoter dr ov e ffLuc basal e xression > 100-fold higher than the erk1 promoter, fusion f the ERK2 Nt moiety increased ffLuc activity by \u223c2.5- old (Figure 3 A, lower panel). These observations were reroduced in other mammalian cell lines, including mouse euro2a, B16 melanoma and C2C12 (data not shown), and uman cell lines HEK293 and HeLa. Fusions that included RK Nt domains did not alter ffLuc mRNA le v el as deermined by quantitati v e re v erse transcription\u2013PCR (RT\u2013 PCR) in NIH3T3 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A), sugesting that the ERK Nt acts post-transcriptionally.\nTo assess whether the ERK Nt improv es e xpression of ull-length ffLuc at the expense of smaller polypeptides, as as observed with ERK1 protein expression itself, we anlyzed ffLuc expression by immunoblotting. To maximize he signal, we replaced the C-terminal PEST sequence of fLuc with the HA-tag and transfected HeLa and HEK293 ells (Figure 3 B). In constructs containing the erk1 prooter, in the absence of the ERK Nt sequence, full-length fLuc was weakly expressed at the expected size of 61.8 Da (lane 1, red arrow), while there was greater intensity or two bands of \u223c58 and 55 kDa, sizes corresponding to he expected sizes of polypeptides generated from the secnd and third in-frame AUG codons of ffLuc (sequences in upplementary Figure S2B). When the ERK1 or ERK2 Nt as present (lanes 2 and 3), intense bands appeared with izes consistent with full-length ffLuc, while expression of ow er molecular w eight bands markedly decreased. Comared with the ERK2 Nt, the ERK1 Nt more efficiently reuced expression of the low molecular weight forms (Figure B, lane 2 versus 3), as was also observed for ERK1 protein Figure 2 D).\nTo confirm that the shorter polypeptides are due to leaky canning, we mutated the second in-frame AUG of ffLuc A 88 to G, corresponding to a ffLuc M30V protein mutaion). In the absence of the second AUG (Figure 3 C, lanes 4\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nand 5), the 58 kDa band (#1) disappeared while the 55 kDa band (#2) increased in intensity. This result demonstrates tha t transla tion starts a t an AUG further downstream when the second in-frame AUG is muta ted. W hen the ERK1 Nt is fused to f fLuc, muta tion of the second in-frame AUG leads to weak expression of the 55 kDa polypeptide (Figure 3 C, lane 6), while when the ERK1 Nt is fused to the WT-ffLuc the bands at 58 and 55 kDa are not expressed significantly (Figure 3 C, lane 3). This suggests a potential interaction between the first two AUGs, leading to a pr efer ence for translation from the first one. These data support the idea that the ERK Nts can optimize start codon selection, leading to incr eased expr ession of full-length proteins, and thereby improve translational fidelity through the pre v ention of leaky scanning.\nWhen tested in the settings of two nearby AUGs, the ERK Nt reduces leaky scanning in all reading frames\nTo further support our hypothesis that start codon selection in erk1 is inefficient in the absence of the ERK Nt domain, we tested whether a nearby downstream AUG in a favorab le Kozak conte xt would be recognized by the scanning pre-initiation complex (PIC). We inserted a sequence of 69 nucleotides flanked by two AUGs upstream of the ffLuc coding sequence, the first AUG being the nati v e erk1 AUG with its nati v e Kozak conte xt. When the second AUG was in an unfavorable Kozak context (CUU AU AUU A-AUGG, termed \u2018Kozak poor\u2019), ffLuc activity appeared low in the absence of the Nt (Figure 4 A, lane 1) and ffLuc remained low in the presence of the control HSTK Nt (lane 2). Howe v er, in the presence of the ERK1 Nt upstream of the first AUG, ffLuc activity increased almost 5-fold (lane 3). When the second AUG was in a favorable context (GCCGCCGCC-AUG-G, termed \u2018Kozak canonical\u2019), ffLuc activity increased even in the absence of the Nt (Figure 4 A, compare lanes 4 and 1). Indeed, there was no significant difference in ffLuc activity in the presence or the absence of the ERK1 Nt on the first AUG (compare lanes 4 and 6). In the presence of the HSTK Nt downstream of the first AUG, a second AUG in the good Kozak context also increased ffLuc activity (compare lanes 2 and 5). Overall, the results in Figure 4 A suggest that when the ERK Nt is removed, the native mouse erk1 AUG itself is not favored for start codon selection and the PIC scans the mRNA until a more favorable AUG is encountered.\nIn Figure 4 A, both nearby AUGs were in the same reading frame, whereas in Figure 4 B we sought to test whether the presence of the ERK Nt at the first AUG could also influence AUG choice downstream, in alternati v e reading frames. Here, the second AUG is either in the second reading frame relati v e to erk1 AUG (lanes 1\u20133), or in the third reading frame (lanes 4\u20136). It is important to note that only the use of this second AUG in alternati v e reading frames will allow expression of the functional ffLuc. In the absence of the Nt at the first AUG, ffLuc expression was elevated when the second AUG was in the second reading frame (Figure 4 B, lane 1) or in the third reading frame (lane 4). In the presence of the HSTK Nt, expression of ffLuc remained eleva ted in alterna tive reading frames, although slightly less than in the absence of the Nt, particularly in the third read-\ning frame (lane 5). Howe v er, in the presence of the ERK1 Nt, expression of ffLuc was maximally reduced in both alternati v e reading frames (Figure 4 B, lanes 3 and 6). These results confirm that the presence of the ERK1 Nt enforces start codon selection and dictates the reading frame, such that expression from alternati v e reading frames is markedly reduced, e v en when the downstream AUGs are in a very favorab le conte xt (canonical Kozak). Note that all AUGs examined here have a G +4 context. Thus, although the ERK1 Kozak context has an optimal composition with a purine at \u20133 and a G at +4 ( 15 ), leaky scanning occurs in the absence of the Nt in the same reading frame (Figure 4 A) or in alternati v e reading frames (Figure 4 B).\nHuman ERKs have a second nearby AUG to further reduce leaky scanning\nA natur al in-fr ame AUG codon exists at the end of mouse ERK2, human ERK2 and human ERK1 Nt sequences (Figure 2 A). We investigated whether this second AUG participated in ERK start codon selection and as a consequence further reduced leaky scanning. An AUG, or the control codons GUG or GUC, was inserted between the ERK2 Nt and ffLuc in the context of the erk1 promoter, because this promoter / Nt combination allows better visualization of the leaky scanning products (Figures 2 D and 3 B). In Figure 4 C, imm unoblot anal ysis indicates that all constructs produced the functional ffLuc protein (upper band) along with some leaky scanning products at 58 and 55 kDa (see quantification in Figure 4 C, lower panel). Leaky scanning was maximized in the absence of the ERK1 Nt (lane 1) but diminished in the presence of the ERK1 Nt and ERK2 Nt (lanes 2 and 3). In the ERK2 Nt constructs, insertion of GUC or the near-cognate GUG codon after the Nt did not affect luciferase production (lanes 5 and 6 versus 3), whereas insertion of an AUG codon at the same position reduced leaky scanning (different plasmid preparations of lanes 4 and 7 versus 3). Leaky scanning observed in the context of the erk1 promoter is also observed with the human KRAS Nt with its nati v e promoter (lane 8). Considering that ERK polypeptides resulting from leaky scanning are not phosphorylated by MEK (Figure 2 D), these results suggest that the presence of two in-frame AUGs in close proximity increases synthesis of fully functional ERKs.\nFeatures of the erk1 5 \u2032 -UTR that confer ERK Nt action\nWe studied the specificity of the ERK Nt by using proximal promoters from two other genes, HSV-TK and human KRAS. For these promoters of strengths similar to that of mouse erk1 , fusion of their respecti v e Nt moieties to ffLuc had no impact on ffLuc activity (Figure 5 A). The ERK2 Nt induced a modest but significant increase of activity in the context of both the HSV-TK promoter and the KRAS promoter (Figure 5 A). These results demonstra te tha t the maximal increase of ffLuc expression is specific to the combination of erk promoters / 5 \u2032 -UTR and ERK Nts.\nWe explored whether specific domains within the erk 5 \u2032 - UTR wer e r equir ed for efficient translation of full-length protein. Recognizing that deletions of the 5 \u2032 -UTR may remove pr omoter sequences, pr ogressive shortening of the\nA\nB\nC\nFigure 4.

Ribosome entry for the second cistron was provided by FGF-1A IRES, a weak cellular IRES ( 34 ). This weak cellular IRES a voids ca veats of strong viral IRES, such as driving AUG choice without scanning in some cases ( 35 ). For these constructs, the AUG of the second cistron (ffLuc) was in the context of the erk1 Kozak sequence (Figure 5 B). When the ERK1 Nt was fused to ffLuc, increasing the length of the erk1 5 \u2032 -UTR progressi v ely increased ffLuc activity (Figure 5 B), while in the absence of the Nt, increasing the length of the erk1 5 \u2032 -UTR had a progressi v ely inhibitory effect. With very short 5 \u2032 -UTR sequences (9\u201320 nucleotides, including the erk1 Kozak context), no significant differences were observed in the presence or absence of the ERK1 Nt, whereas maximal ffLuc activity was observed in the presence of the ERK1 Nt with the complete 5 \u2032 -UTR sequence of mouse erk1 (186 nucleotides, including the erk1 Kozak sequence 36). These results show that the entire 5 \u2032 -UTR is needed for the full response.\nTo study the specificity of the erk1 Kozak sequence for ERK1 Nt action, we swapped its nucleotides with those of the canonical Kozak sequence, in the presence or absence of the ERK1 Nt fused to ffLuc. Importantly, all constructs were in a G +4 context, from AUG\u2013GCG (Met\u2013Ala) with the Nt or from AUG\u2013GAA (Met\u2013Glu) in the absence of the Nt. In the absence of the ERK1 Nt (Figure 5 C, white bars), w hen the er k1 Kozak sequence was replaced by the canonical Kozak sequence, ffLuc activity was increased by 4-fold (line 1 versus line 3). This indicates that, compared with the erk1 Kozak sequence, the canonical Kozak sequence more efficiently dri v es start codon selection. Howe v er, when the ERK1 Nt is fused upstream of the reporter gene (yellow bars), the canonical Kozak sequence was associated with reduced ffLuc activity (lane 2 versus lane 4). As the G nucleotides at positions \u20133, \u20136 and \u20139 are conserved in the erk1 Kozak sequences and the canonical sequence, we swapped other positions by pairs, creating hybrid Kozak sequences (Figure 5 C). In the absence of the ERK1 Nt (white bars), any changes to the canonical Kozak sequence within the six nucleotides closest to AUG reduced luciferase activity (lanes 7 and 9); howe v er, changes further upstream had no effect. In the presence of the ERK1 Nt, the intact erk1 Kozak sequence was the most efficient for driving ffLuc activity (lane 2 versus lanes 4, 6, 8 and 10). These results suggest that either the erk1 Kozak context is r equir ed for full action of the ERK1 Nt, or the canonical Kozak sequence is incompatible with the ERK1 Nt sequence.\nFeatures of the ERK Nt that enhance start codon selection\nTo characterize the Nt domain r equir ements for this function, and particularly the role of the stretch of Ala GCG , we first modified the ERK2 Nt nucleotide sequence in order to progressi v ely decrease the number of alanine residues and evaluated the impact on ffLuc activity. Figure 6 A shows that the presence of all six alanine residues induced the highest ffLuc output (16-fold), whereas all other combinations wer e no mor e than half as efficient, the lowest effect being with two alanine r esidues. Mor eover, r emoving the last three amino acids of the ERK2 Nt (GPE) had no impact\nA\nB\nC\nFigur e 6. Anal ysis of ERK Nt features that contribute to start codon selection.

Taken together, these results emonstra te tha t the number of alanine residues in the Nt s of high importance. To test whether the Nt nucleotide sequence is r equir ed to e located immediately downstream of the initiating AUG, e frameshifted the position of the ERK2 Nt progressi v ely hile maintaining the ffLuc coding frame downstream (Figre 6 B). Frameshifting was carried out with G or C nuleotides to adhere to the GC richness of the ERK2 Nt 96%, Figure 6 C upper sequence). When the start codon nd the ERK2 Nt were positioned in their nati v e state, ffLuc ctivity increased by 13-fold compared with ffLuc without he ERK2 Nt (Figure 6 B, lane 1 versus 2). The insertion of ne, two or three nucleotides between the start codon and he Nt abolished this response (lanes 3\u20135), demonstrating hat the position of the Nt is essential to mediate full expresion of functional ffLuc. Hence, replacing all the alanine GCG) by glycine (GGC) in the Nt (lane 3), or inserting a ingle glycine before the ERK Nt (lane 5), markedly reduced uciferase activity, although these glycine codons are 100%\nC rich. These findings indicate that either the position of he Nt, immediately downstream of the AUG, or the stretch f alanine residues itself is required, particularly an alanine esidue next to Met i .\nAlanine can be translated from four different codons, but n both the ERK1 and the ERK2 Nt, the rarest mammalian lanine codon (GCG) is used. We ther efor e tested various ombina tions of alterna ti v e alanine codons in the Nt to deermine if the nucleotide sequence rather than the amino cid sequence was the root cause of the Nt effect. As shown efore, WT-ERK2-Nt, w hich contains onl y Ala GCG codons, ncreased luciferase activity by 18-fold compared with contructs lacking the Nt (Figure 6 C, lane 1 versus 2). Upon witching to Ala GCC codons, the response was lower (10- old induction, lane 3 versus 1), and luciferase activity was v en further reduced when all the codons were maximally / U rich (4-fold induction, lane 4 versus 1), demonstratng that codon composition is crucial. Considering that the mino acid sequences of these proteins are identical (Figure C, lower panel), our results also suggest that the marked ifferences in response cannot be attributed to changes in rotein half-life. Hence, the optimal alanine codon compoition of the ERK2 Nt to mediate its function on protein xpression is a stretch of six GCG codons.\nany human proteins possess ERK-like Nt moieties\nRK1 and ERK2 are encoded by two separate genes that oth r equir e closely r elated NTARs for pr ecise and efficient ransla tion initia tion. To identify other proteins with ERKike Nt domains, we screened for alanine-rich sequences pecifically located at the N-termini of human proteins. Aritrarily, we limited our quest to a 13 amino acid long seuence, corresponding to the size of the ERK2 NTARs up o the second AUG. Out of 23 325 human proteins analyzed, 1% start with Met\u2013Ala, alanine being by far the most freuent amino acid in the second position (Supplementary igure S4A). To rank NTAR proteins, we gave increasing eight to alanine residues near Met i because we showed hat a glycine after AUG is detrimental, and considered he total number of alanine residues because an increased\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nnumber correlates with increased effecti v eness of the ERK2 Nt. We identified PABPN1 as a leading candidate, with 10 consecuti v e alanine residues after Met i (Figure 7 ; full list in Supplementary Table S1). Mutations within the PABPN1 gene that extend the alanine str etch ar e associated with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD 37 ).\nEach of the first 100 proteins on our list has at least thr ee alanine r esidues immediately after Met i , and an overall alanine content of 55% within the first 12 amino acids downstream of Met i (versus 10% average among all human proteins). In addition to alanine, glycine residues are over-r epr esented in our top 100 NTAR proteins (Supplementary Figure S4B). Howe v er, gly cine is not observed adjacent to Met i in the first 448 proteins of the NTAR list, and only in 1% of the first 1000 NTAR proteins, while it is observed adjacent to Met i in 7.6% of all human proteins (Supplementary Figure S4A). Selected proteins ranked lower on the list are presented in Figure 7 to demonstrate the breadth of ERK-like NTAR proteins. Some lack alanine immediately adjacent to Met i but have other features consistent with NTARs, such as NIPA1, ranked in 529th position, with 10 alanine residues within the first 12 amino acids (MGT AAAAAAAAAA ), and PRKACA, ranked 1997th, that has four consecuti v e Ala GCC codons (MGN AAAA KKGSEQ).\nTo confirm that the ERK Nt translational regulation also applies to other NTAR proteins, we examined the Nt sequence of se v eral pr oteins. The pr oximal pr omoter / 5 \u2032 - UTRs of PABPN1 (1.5 kb, ranked 1 in the list), TRIM28 (886 bp, ranked 110), MECP2 (966 bp, ranked 20) and NIPA1 (1444 bp, ranked 529) were cloned in the absence or presence of their Nt sequences upstream of the ffLuc reporter. Like the ERK2 Nt, the PABPN1 Nt has six Ala GCG codons loca ted immedia tely downstream of Met i , and four additional alanine codons follow (sequence shown in Supplementary Figure S10). The PABPN1 Nt increased luciferase activity 3-fold (manuscript in preparation).\nUnlike the Nt of ERKs, the TRIM28 Nt has only one Ala GCG dir ectly downstr eam of Met i , and it also does not harbor stretches of repeated alanine codons. Howe v er, TRIM28 protein has an alanine-rich Nt with 14 alanine residues out of the first 19 residues (bottom of Figure 8 A), with overall 50% of alanine in the first 48 amino acids downstream of Met i . Fusion of the TRIM28 Nt to ffLuc incr eased ffLuc expr ession by \u223c4-fold (Figur e 8 A). A similar boosting effect was obtained when fusing the entire sequence upstream of the second AUG to ffLuc (114 amino acids named \u2018long-Nt\u2019).\nUnlike the ERK2 Nt with its six Ala GCG , the Nt of MECP2 displays a row of six Ala GCC (followed by one Ala GCG , sequence at the bottom of Figure 8 B and in Supplementary Figure S10). The Nt of MECP2 increased ffLuc expression 5-fold (Figure 8 B, lanes 1 versus 2) which was significantl y reduced w hen codons were switched to Ala GCG (lane 3), and induction was nearly abolished when codons were switched to Ala GCA / GCU (lane 4). Therefore, when comparing the Nt of ERK2 (Figure 6 C) with the Nt of MECP2 (Figure 8 B), alanine codons rich in G / C are favored in both cases, but the most effecti v e codon (GCG versus GCC) depends on the promoter / 5 \u2032 -UTR upstream of AUG.\nUnlike the Nt of ERKs, the NIPA1 Nt has a very long stretch of 13 alanine residues that is separated from Met i by a glycine and thr eonine r esidues, and, unlike the Nt of ERKs, the NIPA1 stretch of eight Ala GCG codons is located se v en r esidues downstr eam from Met i (sequence at the bottom of Figure 8 C). Despite these differences, the WT sequence of the NIPA1 Nt increased ffLuc expression 3-fold (Figure 8 C, lanes 1 versus 2). Because insertion of a single glycine between Met i and the six alanines of the ERK2 Nt nearly abolished completely the action of the ERK2 Nt (Figure 6 B), we decided to test whether the two non-alanine residues could hamper the strength of the alanine stretch of NIPA1. Indeed, removal of glycine and threonine adjacent to Met i increased ffLuc expression 10-fold (lane 3), i.e. > 3- fold higher than the WT NIPA1 sequence. This increased effect is not due to the mere shortening of the NIPA1 Nt because e v en with remo val of tw o Ala GCG codons ffLuc levels wer e incr eased as efficiently as with the WT sequence (lane 4). These observations confirm that NTARs seem to function better when alanine residues are located adjacent to Met i .\nHundreds of human proteins display alanine-rich sequences at their N-termini (Supplementary Table S1). For ERK1, ERK2, PABPN1, TRIM28, MECP2 and NIPA1, their respecti v e NTARs increase e xpression of functional ffLuc in the context of their own promoter / 5 \u2032 -UTR, which is not the case for proteins without an alanine-rich Nt such as KRAS (Figure 3 D). Collecti v ely, alanine richness seems to be the common feature of NTAR proteins; howe v er, for each gene, specific NTAR features may additionally contribute to proper start codon selection in the context of their proximal promoters. In summary, our work shows that NTAR sequences play a key role in translation initiation by favoring the proper start codon, ther eby incr easing the amounts of an important subset of human proteins."

The nucleotide sequences encoding the ERK Nt are highly GC rich, and the protein sequences include a stretch of 5\u20136 Ala GCG codons immediately downstream from the initiating Met i , the NTARs (Figure 2 A). In this work, we demonstra ted tha t the ERK1 NTAR has no role in kinase catalytic activity (Figure 2 C), which we assumed for two reasons: first, invertebrate ERK proteins lack these Nt repeated amino acids, and second, the crystal structures of the catalytic domains of mammalian ERK proteins do not include the Nt amino acids (e.g. Protein Data Bank entries 2ZOQ or 4QTB).\nWe have also shown that ERK NTARs play no role in transcription (Supplementary Figure S3A). Howe v er, we found that in the context of their own proximal promoter / 5 \u2032 -UTR, ERK NTAR moieties are associated with increased synthesis of the functional protein (Figure 2 D, E). They ensure start codon selection and reduce leaky scanning through interactions involving the entir e 5 \u2032 -UTR (Figur es 4 and 5 ).

Leaky scanning was confirmed by ite-directed mutagenesis of the second AUG, thereby rulng out other mechanisms such as degradation. Synthetic onstructs re v ealed that the ERK1 NTAR also enforces ts r eading frame, ther eby avoiding synthesis of peptides rom alternati v e frames (Figure 4 B). The co-evolution of RK1 and ERK2 NTARs indica tes tha t there is a strong volutionary pr essur e to select these peculiar sequences, her efor e they must play an important role. Indeed, NTAR oieties could have arisen to decrease the production of oxic proteins translated via alternati v e reading frames (Figre 4 B), or to increase the quantity of functional proteins Figure 2 D, E). Considering that protein synthesis r equir es ore energy than any other metabolic process ( 38 ), NTARs hould benefit the cell by tipping the balance in favor of unctional protein synthesis at the expense of leaky scaning products. This could be particularly relevant when onsidering that NTAR-containing proteins are highly nriched among housekeeping proteins (Supplementary igure S7). It is extremely puzzling that both erk1 and erk2 r equir e TARs because the nati v e AUGs of these two genes fulfill he known criteria for efficient start codon choice. On one and, the Kozak sequences of both erk1 and erk2 are purortedly \u2018good\u2019 contexts because they harbor a purine in \u20133 nd a G in +4 (+1 being the A of AUG). On the other hand, n mouse, the erk2 5 \u2032 -UTR has no uAUG while the erk1 5 \u2032 - TR has only one uAUG which cannot be functional beause it is adjacent to a stop codon [the sizes of mouse 5 \u2032 - TRs were determined by primer extension to be 186 nuleotides for erk1 and 223 nucleotides for erk2 ( 36 , 39 ), and, t these sizes, human sequences have no uAUGs]. Why then oes ERK translation not start at the first AUG, which is in \u2018good\u2019 context, in the absence of NTARs? By definition, TARs ar e downstr eam of the AUG because they code for roteins, and so far the only downstr eam featur e known to ncrease AUG choice is a stem\u2013loop placed exactly 14 nuleotides downstream of the AUG according to M. Kozak\n( t i i c w i\nh n a i t e t A c t f m g o A a m o\ng s i m N A 1 a F t A t s n f 5 t m p a c G m C m D fi c a c b s t m\no fi t f r f\nt c i t t a c e i w t i 6 f i N c u\n3 T t e S 5 t t c e c a o t s v p g i p o a l t t c N t N t w a t i w\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\n40 ). Because a single mRNA molecule is scanned simulaneously by se v eral ribosomes, it was proposed that slowng down the elongating ribosome by the stem\u2013loop makes t collide with the trailing scanning PICs and pause them lose to the AUG codon to facilitate initiation. Hence, here e have searched for features of ERK NTARs that could be nvolved in slowing down the nascent elongating ribosome. First, we have shown that the ERK2 NTAR sequence arbors a second in-frame AUG that reduces leaky scaning significantly (Figure 4 C). Indeed, previous in silico nalyses have found that a second AUG is often present n mRNAs with a suboptimal Kozak context at their nai v e start codon ( 41 ). This fits with the observation that the rk1 Kozak sequence inefficiently flags the start codon in he absence of NTARs (Figure 5 C). Ribosome assembly on UG takes longer than the time r equir ed for a PIC to scan a odon ( 42 ). In the case of erk2 mRNA, the distance between he two AUGs is the same size as RNA fragments protected rom nuclease treatment by a single ribosome, the so-called RNA channel ( 43 ). Ther efor e, this second AUG is strate-\nically located downstream of the first AUG at the distance f the RNA channel because a ribosome on this second UG would temporarily roadblock an incoming PIC exctly on the first AUG. As with human ERK1 and ERK2, any NTAR proteins (11% of those in Figure 7 ) have a secnd nearby in-frame AUG. Second, it was proposed that rare codons slow the pro-\nression of the elongating ribosome because it has been hown that clusters of rare codons slow down translation n order to allow time for proper folding of protein do-\nains ( 44 ). In addition, in silico analysis re v ealed that the t of human proteins is enriched in rare codons, mainly for la GCG , Pro CGG and Ser UCG ( 45 , 46 ), and among the first\n00 proteins of Figure 7 , we showed that 51% of all four lanine codons are the rarest Ala GCG . Indeed, as shown in igure 6 C, the strength of ERK2 NTARs decreased when he six rare Ala GCG codons were replaced by six frequent la GCC codons. Ther efor e, codon rarity could very well paricipate to slow the nascent elongating ribosome and, as uch, favor start codon choice for the trailing PICs. Alterati v ely, the codon specificity may reflect the requirement or secondary structures, possibly by pairing NTARs with \u2032 -UTR sequences. In favor of a structural role for NTARs, he ERK2 NTAR acts specifically in the context of erk prooters because it is ineffecti v e downstream of the Kras r oximal pr omoter (Figure 5 A). Howe v er, when modifying lanine codon composition, changing the third base of the odon from G to C was less detrimental than changing from to A / U in ERK2 (Figure 6 C). This argues against the foration of secondary structures, because a change from G to disrupts secondary structures more than G to A, or e v en ore than G to U which can generate wobble pairings ( 47 ). ue to the duality of codon / nucleotide sequence, it is difcult to unambiguously demonstra te tha t a stretch of rare odons acts by forming a secondary structure rather than as consequence of the rare codons themselves. Ther efor e, we annot dismiss completely a role for secondary structures, ut we favor the idea that codon rarity in the ERK2 NTAR lo ws do wn the leading ribosome. The balance was tipped owards codon rarity by observing that there are twice as any Ala GCG than Ala GCC codons in NTAR proteins (51%\nf all alanine codons versus 23% respecti v ely, among the rst 100 NTARs, Supplementary Table S1). Ther efor e, alhough both codons are 100% GC rich, which should allow ormation of secondary structures of similar strength, the arest codon is highly preferred (codon frequencies of 0.11 or Ala GCG versus 0.40 for Ala GCC , in mammals).\nA third feature of the ERK NTARs that could slow down he initiating ribosome is the repetition of 5\u20136 identical odons, which is suggesti v e of tRNA channeling, a process n which a limited set of tRNAs are constantly reloaded in he vicinity of the ribosome upon association of aminoacylRNA synthetases with the ribosome ( 48 , 49 ). When studied s doublets, or when ordered along the mRNA, correlated odons were shown to dri v e faster translation ( 49 ). Howv er, in NTAR sequences, the codons are often repeated n rows, requiring constant reloading of the same tRNA, hich will be limited by local concentration effects. Imporantly, the strength of action of the ERK2 NTARs markedly ncreased with six alanines in a row instead of three (Figure A). Among other NTARs, codon repetition is observed or other amino acids, bolstering a role for tRNA channelng to contribute to start codon choice. For example, the\nTAR of human MECP2 contains six consecuti v e Ala GCC odons, fiv e consecuti v e Gly GGA codons and three consecti v e Glu GAG codons. The fourth and, so far, final feature is the alanine richness \u2032 adjacent to Met i for both the ERK1 and ERK2 NTARs. his feature might also contribute to slowing the pace of he elongating ribosome. Alanine richness can be highly elvated among NTAR proteins, as indicated in Figure 7 and upplementary Table S1. The Translation Initiator of Short \u2032 -UTR (TISU) that dri v es scanning-independent translaion ( 50 ) also favors two consecuti v e alanine residues afer Met i with the consensus sequence AUG\u2013GCG\u2013GCN, oding for Met\u2013Ala\u2013Ala ( 51 ). Furthermore, among highly xpressed proteins, alanine has been shown to be the most ommon amino acid immediately following the Met i across broad range of species ( 52 ). Considering that selection f the start codon in bacteria is dri v en by a direct interacion between rRN A and mRN A via the Shine\u2013Dalgarno equence, alanine pr efer ence may suggest a biophysical adantage during translation. In our case, this advantage is exerimentally confirmed with the replacement of alanine by lycine residues, the two most common amino acids present n NTARs (Figure 7 ; Supplementry Figure S4B). The relacement by se v en gly cines in a row, or just the insertion f a single glycine between the Met i and the stretch of six lanines, was sufficient to markedly reduce start codon seection (Figure 6 B). Similarly, in the case of NIPA1 proein, removal of a glycine and a threonine at the second and hird positions resulted in the alanine stretch being adjaent to Met i , which significantly increased the efficacy of the TARs (Figure 8 C). The detrimental effect of a glycine at he second position may be a general phenomenon among TAR proteins. For NIPA1, the first four alanine codons hat were juxtaposed with the initiating Met i via mutation ere neither rare nor repeated codons, suggesting a role for lanine per se . Glycine is not observed adjacent to Met i in he first 448 proteins of the list of NTARs, and Met\u2013Gly s observed in only 1% of the first 1000 NTAR proteins, hile it is observed adjacent to Met i in 7.6% of all human\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nproteins (Supplementary Figure S4A), reinforcing this notion. Of note, only se v en human proteins start with Met\u2013 Gl y\u2013Gl y\u2013Gl y and 81 start with Met\u2013Gl y\u2013Gl y (for comparison, 280 human proteins start with Met\u2013Ala\u2013Ala\u2013Ala and 1080 start with Met\u2013Ala\u2013Ala; see Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, inserting a glycine upstream of the NTARs did not alter the GC-richness or the G +4 rule of erk1 Kozak, suggesting a pivotal role for alanine residues during translation itself.\nAt this point, one wonders about the biophysical advantage of alanine v ersus gly cine. It has been shown that repeats of large and charged amino acids loca ted a t the Nt of proteins block emergence of the nascent peptidyl chain through the ribosomal exit tunnel (e v en destabilizing the ribosome) ( 53 ). Ther efor e, because alanine and glycine ar e the two smallest amino acids, their elevated presence in NTARs (Figure 7 ; Supplementary Figure S4B) might help to nudge the nascent amino acid chain through the ribosomal exit tunnel. With its methyl side chain, alanine is slightly larger than glycine and neither is charged. Hydropathy measurements have indicated that alanine is weakly hydrophobic whereas glycine is weakly hydrophilic ( 54 , 55 ). Inter estingly, hydrophobic str etches of amino acids have been estimated to cross the ribosomal exit tunnel more slowly than hydrophilic ones ( 56 ). Ther efor e, by being hydrophobic, a stretch of alanine residues may slow the emergence of the nascent peptide from the ribosomal exit tunnel. In turn, this may retard departure of the ribosome, increasing its probability of colliding with an incoming PIC, improving start codon selection by increasing its dwell time on the AUG / Kozak sequence.\nOverall, the ERK2 NTAR accumulates the four features described above, which could converge to slow the departure of the initiating ribosome. First, the ERK2 NTAR displays a second AUG in phase; second, the ERK2 NTAR is rich in rare codons; third, the ERK2 NTAR possesses a stretch of six repeated codons; and fourth, the ERK2 NTAR is highly alanine rich. In humans and great apes, ERK1 also possesses these four features. This model predicts that ribosome density ought to be higher around an AUG when the initiating ribosome is slowed down. Indeed, this has been observed in the vicinity of AUGs in general ( 43 ). Howe v er, it is unlikely that NTARs would increase ribosome density at AUGs at unusually high le v els for two reasons. First, we observed that the ERK2 NTAR does not form a \u2018stand-alone structure\u2019 because it is ineffecti v e in the context of the Kras promoter / 5 \u2032 -UTR (Figure 5 A). Second, ribosome stalling by NTARs must be limited to avoid triggering the ribosome quality control mechanism (RQC) that leads to decay of the mRNA ( 57 ). NTARs may simply be r equir ed to esta blish normal ribosome d well time at an initiating AUG in the context of the 5 \u2032 -UTRs of highly expressed / peculiar HKGs (Supplementary Figure S7).\nAs indicated by their name, NTARs are N-terminal sequences rich in alanine residues, and therefore possess at least one feature that seems to boost start codon selection. NTAR proteins other than ERKs may possess only a subset of the four features present in ERK NTARs that seem to foster start codon selection. For example, the MECP2 mRNA does not possess rare Ala GCG codons, but has three stretches of repeated codons as presented above (sequences\nin Supplementary Figure S10). The sequence encoding the TRIM28 NTARs does not include a long stretch of repeated codons, nor does it have groups of rare codons; howe v er, 14 out of its 19 first amino acids are alanine, as are 24 out of its first 50 residues. The NIPA1 NTAR does not have an alanine next to Met i , but it possesses a stretch of 13 alanines, 8 of which are tandemly repeated rare Ala GCG codons. Mirroring the NTARs, the Kozak sequence on the other side of the AUG plays a major role in start codon selection. It is widely belie v ed that the most effecti v e conte xt to promote accurate start codon selection is the canonical Kozak sequence (GCC)GCCG / ACC-AUG-G ( 15 ). In our study, w e w ere initially surprised to find that very few mRNAs with canonical Kozak sequences have alanine residues in their Nt, and none of them has NTARs (Supplementary Table S1). This is unexpected because both the canonical and erk1 Kozak sequences possess the specific nucleotides that interact with the scanning PIC, notably a purine at the \u20133 position that interacts with eIF2- and a G at +4 that interacts with eIF1A ( 58 ). Ther efor e, we sought to evalua te the rela ti v e strength of the canonical Kozak sequence and its compatibility with NTARs, in the context of the erk1 pr oximal pr omoter. In the absence of an NTAR, the canonical Kozak context is up to 4-fold more efficient than the erk1 Kozak context, which confirms the validity of previous claims (Figure 5 C). Howe v er, in the presence of an NTAR, the canonical Kozak context became inhibitory. Swapping nucleotides between the erk1 and the canonical Kozak sequence confirmed these conclusions by providing intermediate r esults (Figur e 5 C). Replacing the erk1 Kozak sequence with the canonical one could disrupt a secondary structure formed between the NTAR sequence and the erk1 Kozak sequence. Howe v er, we do not favor this possibility because NTAR proteins do not share a common Kozak sequence (Supplementary Figure S5A). Even proteins with the same N-terminal stretch of six alanines do not share a common Kozak sequence (Supplementary Figure S5B). We favor the idea of an incompatibility of ERK NTARs with a canonical Kozak sequence because they form a very stable stem\u2013loop, and similar stem\u2013loops formed at AUGs were shown to reduce translation initiation ( 59 ). Indeed, with a minimal free energy (MFE) of \u201323.6 kcal / mol, this stem\u2013loop is much more stable than all other combinations between Kozak sequences and the NTARs tested (Supplementary Figure S6A). Furthermore, human 5 \u2032 -UTRs with canonical Kozak sequences form stem\u2013loops of much lower strength in the context of their native Nt-coding sequences (average MFE of \u20137.14 kcal / mol; Supplementary Figure S6B).\nIt has been shown that the canonical Kozak context is seldom encountered in the vicinity of vertebrate AUGs ( 60 ), while the boundaries of the NTAR protein family remain to be established. For example, among all members of the RAS\u2013MEK\u2013ERK signaling cascade, only ERK1 and ERK2 rely on NTAR moieties for efficient translation. In parallel, we have shown that the quantity of ERK, but not MEK, influences signaling output (Figure 1 C). This is surprising because ERKs are among the most abundant signaling kinases and ar e mor e highly expressed than MEK ( 31 , 32 ). The co-evolution of the ERK NTARs is stunning.\nO i s fi i E l f a f c t\ns c v r n g p g N o i N m j u f K F t n (\ns t c a b p e i m i o m O s\nm S c h o l r o t h a\nc s v o c t\nD\nT a\nS\nS\nA\nW c C v f h M O\nF\nC C\nR\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/15/7714/7220106 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nn the one hand, the second nearby methionine is present n vertebrate ERK2s from amphibians to mammals but is eldom found in teleost fish and is absent in cartilaginous shes. On the other hand, the second nearby methionine s present in ERK1 of humans and great apes but not in RK1 of other vertebrates, including tarsiers, a closely rea ted prima te. The conv ergent e volution leading to an inrame second methionine in both human ERK1 and ERK2, nd ev olution to wards stretches of the rarest alanine codons or both proteins, suggest the importance of producing preisely full-length functional ERKs in humans, which may in urn have implications for signaling.\nIncreasing evidence indicates that the proteome is greatly haped through translational regulation. For example, the hoice of start codon between AUGs of upstream ORFs ersus the AUG of the major ORF has been shown to egulate the expression of many proteins. This mechaism is at play for ATF4 expression during the interated str ess r esponse, for the balance of eIF1 / eIF5 exr ession [r e vie wed in ( 18 )] and for the regulation of Hox ene expression ( 61 ). Having shown that the presence of TARs strongly increases expression of the main ORFs f ERK1 / 2, we propose that the mechanism of NTARs s not subject to short-term r egulation. Furthermor e, most\nTAR-containing proteins are encoded by HKGs (Suppleentary Figure S7), whose expression is usually not subect to rapid regulation because they are constituti v ely and biquitously expressed to drive basic cellular functions. In act, harmful pathophysiological consequences arise when ozak sequences or NTAR-encoding sequences are altered. or example, mutation of the BRCA1 Kozak sequence conributes to cancer progression ( 62 ), while increasing the umber of alanines in the PABPN1 NTARs causes OPMD 37 ).\nFor cell fate decisions, ERK proteins have attracted coniderable attention because the duration of their activaion dri v es the progressi v e multi-phosphorylation of speific substr ates, particular ly of immediate ear ly genes such s FOS ( 63 ). Here, we re v eal for the first time a direct link etween ERK quantity and the extent of substrate multihosphorylation (Figure 1 C). ERK expression might be elvated and tightly regulated because ERK interacts with all ts partners via the same docking sites, either the CDS (com-\non docking site) or the FRS (F-site recruitment) [re vie wed n ( 7 )]. Indeed, on the activator side, a balanced expression f MEK has been shown to be r equir ed to establish noral cytoplasmic localization of micro-injected ERK ( 64 ). n the substrate side, expression of short-li v ed partners was hown to sustain ERK nuclear localization ( 65 ). Unregula ted activa tion of the ERK pa thway occurs in any cancers, and congenital disorders designated RAopathies are caused by mutations of ERK signaling casade members ( 20 ). Furthermore, amplification of erk genes as been found in se v eral cancers ( 10 , 11 ), and some cases f resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been inked to erk2 gene amplification ( 9 ). Understanding the ole of ERK Nt sequences may facilitate the de v elopment f new strategies to improve the treatment outcomes for hese diseases. Because ERK1 / 2 are among the hundreds of uman NTAR proteins, we propose that the NTAR mechnism r epr esents a general system controlling start codon\nhoice, leading to enhanced transla tion initia tion for a subtantial fraction of human proteins, particularly those inolved in housekeeping functions. A better understanding f NTARs could have implications for synthetic biology, orrecti v e gene therapy and e v en efficient antigen producion by mRNA vaccines.\nA T A A V AILABILITY\nhe data underlying this article are available in the article nd in its online supplementary data.\nUPPLEMENT ARY DA T A\nupplementary Data are available at NAR Online.\nCKNOWLEDGEMENTS\ne are indebted to Dr A.C Prats for providing the biistronic vectors pCRHL and pRCF1AL.
