    "abstractText": "Background: Major depression is the second leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide and is a leading contributor to suicide. However, first-line antidepressants are only fully effective for 33%, and only 40% of those offered psychological treatment attend for two sessions or more. Views gained from patients and primary care professionals are that greater treatment uptake might be achieved if people with depression could be offered alternative and more accessible treatment options. Although there is evidence that the Alpha-Stim Anxiety Insomnia and Depression (AID) device is safe and effective for anxiety and depression symptoms in people with anxiety disorders, there is much less evidence of efficacy in major depression without anxiety. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Alpha-Stim AID device, a cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment that people can safely use independently at home. The device provides CES which has been shown to increase alpha oscillatory brain activity, associated with relaxation. Methods: The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID in treatmentseeking patients (aged 16 years upwards) with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms in primary care. The study is a multi-centre parallel-group, double-blind, non-commercial, randomised controlled superiority trial. The primary objective of the study is to examine the clinical efficacy of active daily use of 8 weeks of AlphaStim AID versus sham Alpha-Stim AID on depression symptoms at 16 weeks (8 weeks after the end of treatment) in people with moderate severity depression. The primary outcome is the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 16 weeks. All trial and treatment procedures are carried out remotely using videoconferencing, telephone and postal delivery considering the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. \u00a9 The Author(s). 2022 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

            "text": "Background: Major depression is the second leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide and is a leading contributor to suicide. However, first-line antidepressants are only fully effective for 33%, and only 40% of those offered psychological treatment attend for two sessions or more. Views gained from patients and primary care professionals are that greater treatment uptake might be achieved if people with depression could be offered alternative and more accessible treatment options. Although there is evidence that the Alpha-Stim Anxiety Insomnia and Depression (AID) device is safe and effective for anxiety and depression symptoms in people with anxiety disorders, there is much less evidence of efficacy in major depression without anxiety. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Alpha-Stim AID device, a cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment that people can safely use independently at home. The device provides CES which has been shown to increase alpha oscillatory brain activity, associated with relaxation.\nMethods: The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID in treatmentseeking patients (aged 16 years upwards) with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms in primary care. The study is a multi-centre parallel-group, double-blind, non-commercial, randomised controlled superiority trial. The primary objective of the study is to examine the clinical efficacy of active daily use of 8 weeks of AlphaStim AID versus sham Alpha-Stim AID on depression symptoms at 16 weeks (8 weeks after the end of treatment) in people with moderate severity depression. The primary outcome is the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 16 weeks. All trial and treatment procedures are carried out remotely using videoconferencing, telephone and postal delivery considering the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2022 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

            "text": "Existing research: prevalence and treatment of depression Major depression is the second leading cause of years lost to disability in the world [1]. From 2007 to 2014, the United Kingdom National Household Survey showed an escalating demand for the treatment of depression and anxiety (1 in 6 adults [2]). Clinically effective, costeffective and safe management of common mental illness, such as depression and anxiety, using a variety of approaches in integrated care systems is a priority for the NHS10 year long-term plan, as is addressing inequalities such as those associated with poverty and ethnicity [3]. Almost a quarter of 17\u201319-year-old women meet the diagnostic criteria for an emotional disorder [4]. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), the rates of depression in the community have more than doubled; around one in five (21%) aged 16 years and over in Great Britain experienced some form of depression (indicated by moderate to severe depressive symptoms) in early 2021 (27 January to 7 March) [5]. The rates were more than double those observed before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, when 10% of adults experienced some form of depression [5]. The impact was felt more greatly in younger\nadults, women and people who live alone\u2014with 43% of women aged between 16 and 29 reporting some form of depression [5]. Currently, the two main forms of treatment offered for depression by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) are antidepressant medications and psychological treatments. However, first-line use of antidepressants is only effective for 1 in 3 of those who try them, and over 1 year, approximately 66% remit. Furthermore, antidepressants are associated with a range of side effects, e.g. sedation, weight gain, cardiac arrhythmia and falls, suggesting that they may not be tolerated by some people, particularly those with physical ill health [6]. Psychological treatments are as effective as antidepressants; however, only 40% of those offered psychological treatments attend for two sessions or more, and of those treated, 49% do not progress or recover [7]. Despite a large increase in the prevalence of depression and evidence of increased mental health burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant reductions in contact with primary services in the UK for mental illness from April 2020 [8]. However, subsequently, primary care mental health demands have risen since the early period of the pandemic, and there has been a rapid transition to virtual care [9]. The current increase in depression rates, coupled with challenges in accessing existing psychological treatments, suggests a need for the availability of novel treatments for depression to be offered as part of routine NHS care. Our consultation with patient and public involvement and engagement (PPI/E) representatives and primary care practitioners indicated that novel treatment approaches that were effective, easily accessible and could be used at home with minimal supervision may increase treatment uptake without overburdening primary care services."

            "heading": "Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES)",
            "text": "CES is an established form of non-invasive low alternating current neuromodulation treatment. It is related to other forms of transcranial electrical stimulation, including electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial direct current stimulation. CES was developed in Russia in 1900 and was first used to induce sleep and relaxation [10] by applying small electric currents to the head. Since the 1970s, CES has been used increasingly in clinical settings. In America, one of the most commonly used CES devices since the 1980s is Alpha-Stim (Electromedical Products International, Inc.). Alpha-Stim AID is the latest model of electrotherapy device for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia and depression. Alpha-Stim AID was CE marked in 2012 as a class IIa medical device. It is a small mobile phone-sized device powered by two AAA batteries and is attached by leads to both\nearlobes. It delivers a patterned, subsensory (cannot be felt or detected), electrical waveform and has been associated with a reduction in delta (0\u20133.5 Hz) and beta (12.5\u201330 Hz) frequency brainstem and cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activity and an increase in alpha (8\u201312 Hz) activity (associated with states of relaxation) [11]. It can be used daily for 20\u201360 min. The device with a 5-year maintenance package retails at approximately \u00a3500 with a 5-year warranty. However, since depression is associated with social deprivation, the cost of the device is a significant barrier to its uptake for the treatment of depression with the majority of people with depression unable to afford the device [12]."

            "heading": "Evidence base for Alpha-Stim AID",
            "text": "A systematic review carried out by the US Veterans Administration identified 5 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 198 participants for anxiety or mixed anxiety and depression disorders comparing CES to sham CES [13]. The review concluded that there was low-quality evidence of the effectiveness of CES in relation to anxiety and depression symptoms. A previous study reported that Alpha-Stim AID significantly reduced depression from baseline to endpoint of the study [14]. Moreover, in a trial of 115 participants with primary anxiety disorder, 5 weeks of active Alpha-Stim AID 100 was shown to be more effective than sham devices in reducing depression [15]. Recently, researchers in England carried out an implementation study in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) setting [16]. The findings indicated that, in 161 patients with moderate to severe generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) who had not responded to first-line psychological treatment, the mean PHQ-9 scores of self-rated depression dropped from 16.1 to 11.2 by week 4. Furthermore, the mean PHQ-9 scores dropped to 10.4 at week 6, and by week 12, PHQ-9 scores were at normal levels (8.9) indicating remission of symptoms at week 12, which was maintained to week 24. There was slippage in the mean score of depression by less than 1 point on the PHQ-9 at 24 weeks suggesting that a course of 8 weeks of using Alpha-Stim AID rather than 6 weeks CES may be optimal for the treatment of depression symptoms. There was similar moderate to large improvements in anxiety symptoms. Only four (2.5%) participants withdrew from treatment because of side effects. Compared to individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), Alpha-Stim AID provided a cost saving of \u00a3540.88 per patient (95% confidence interval \u00a3327.12, \u00a3648.69). Cost modelling by the company suggests that the cost of Alpha-Stim AID could be as low as \u00a340 in primary care [16]. However, there are no trials of cost-effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID for depression in primary care settings. Furthermore, there is a need for further sham-based RCTs,\nsince the daily routine of using a device might in itself have benefits on depression since structuring the day is a technique used in some behaviour therapy treatments for depression [17]. The device might therefore seem to be effective through an active placebo effect. The NHS in the UK and other health services require more evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness in a primary care setting, where similar devices are routinely used for other long-term \u2018physical health\u2019 conditions and where the majority of treatment for depression takes place [18]. Although the evidence base, tolerability, patient preference and ease of use are promising, a recent report by NICE [18] recommends that there is a need for a further randomised controlled trial of the longterm clinical and cost-effectiveness in treatment-seeking patients with moderate depression in primary care. This research will investigate if offering Alpha-Stim AID to people with moderate depression in primary care can reduce depression, provide more evidence of tolerability and examine cost-effectiveness."

The device provides electrical stimulation by generating bipolar, asymmetric, rectangular waves with a frequency of 0.5 Hz and a current intensity that is pre-set and locked by the manufacturer at its lowest therapeutic dose at 100 \u03bcA, a subsensory level. This level has been found to be effective [15, 26]. The unlocked device is marketed and sold in the UK available from private purchase at a cost of approximately \u00a3500. Participants will be informed that they are expected to undertake 60-min daily self-directed Alpha-Stim AID treatment sessions for 8 weeks. Participants will receive an instructional video on the use of the device and a written leaflet, and they will be advised to contact the practice staff or study team if they have any queries. Participants will be provided with treatment logs to document the day, time and duration of treatment. A GP, nurse or health care assistant (HCA) from the GP surgery will telephone each participant within 72 h of starting active Alpha-Stim AID or sham Alpha-Stim AID treatment to discuss any uncertainties, record and discuss side effects and check participants\u2019 mental state to ensure that participants are not at risk of self-harm or suicide. If there are any concerns related to the participant\u2019s safety, then the GP and research team will be informed. The sham Alpha-Stim AID devices will be identical to the active device in look, sound and feel, but the ear clip electrodes will not emit electricity. Participants who receive the sham device will be provided with identical information and instructions. They will also receive a 72 h follow-up call. Participants will not be able to change any of the device settings that regulate current, frequency and time on either of the devices. The manufacturers (Electromedical Products International, Inc.) will test the active and sham devices before they will be shipped to the distributors in the UK (the Microcurrent Site Ltd.) to ensure that sham devices are not emitting a current.\nCriteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b} Data on the impact of the intervention on reducing depressive symptoms and other outcome measures will not be analysed until the end of the study period and therefore will not inform decisions to stop the research. However, serious adverse events (SAEs) and serious adverse device events (SADEs) will be reviewed, and if there is any indication that these are linked to the intervention, consideration will be given to stopping on the advice of the National Institute for Health Research\n(NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration (ARC) East Midlands (EM) Scientific Committee and study sponsor.\nStrategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c} Participants will be provided with treatment logs to document the day, time and duration of treatment. Adherence will be determined from self-report and use of the machine (calculated from the counter that is part of the display output of the machine). This gives the total amount of time used. We will consider participants to be adherent if they have used the machine for a minimum of 28 h, i.e. at least 50% of the intervention time. This is because in a previous study, 75% of improvement in depression symptoms with Alpha-Stim AID occurred in the first 4 weeks of the intervention [16].\nRelevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial {11d} Participants will be advised to return the device within a maximum of 10 weeks from receipt of the device. This will be stipulated in the participation information sheet and consent form. We will advise participants not to purchase the device privately during their participation in the study, but they may wish to purchase it thereafter. If participants inform the researchers that they have purchased a device during their participation in the study, this will be recorded on the CSRI. Participants who are already on any antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication will be asked to remain on the same dose of their medication during their participation in the study.

Wider resource use incurred by the NHS, social services, families and employers will be collected using an adapted version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [20]. The CSRI is completed through interviews with the participant collected at baseline, 4, 8 and 16 weeks follow-up. These will be costed using published unit costs, e.g. from the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU), NHS reference costs and British National Formulary.\nThe outcome measure used for the economic analysis will be quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), derived from utilities captured using the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L instrument, which is responsive in depression even over short time periods [28], and valued using the recommended tariff at the time of analysis [29]. Following the NICE recommendations, utility values in reference case analyses will be calculated by mapping the 5L descriptive system data onto the 3L value set [29]. Using this information on costs and benefits, an incremental cost-utility analysis will be conducted and reported using an accepted methodology, including a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showing the probability that the intervention is cost-effective at a range of threshold values for the willingness to pay per QALY [30]."

Although multilevel modelling for repeated measures could be automatically taken into account, missing outcomes under MAR assumption may be used to give sensible results [32]. To ensure all randomised participants will be included in the analysis, the missing values will be imputed using multilevel modelling to quantify the treatment effect estimates [32]. The results of modelling on observed data will be used as a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of results sensitive to missing values.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Although the evidence base, tolerability, patient preference and ease of use are promising, there is a need for a further RCT of the long-term clinical and costeffectiveness in treatment-seeking patients with moderate depression in primary care [18]. Alpha-Stim AID is rarely used in NHS care in the UK, but it is used privately. Thus, there is a growing issue of inequity, as depression disproportionately affect the poorest in society, yet Alpha-Stim AID is primarily only available to people who can afford to purchase it but not to the majority of people who cannot afford it. During the early stages of project development, PPI/E representatives from NIHR MindTech MedTech Co-operative and a PPI/E representative from NIHR ARC East Midlands expressed that restricted options for interventions (antidepressants and psychological treatment as the only options) may deter people with depression from getting help. This is corroborated by previous research [33]. PPI/E representatives expressed that they would get the help they needed if there were accessible alternative safe, efficacious, costeffective, easy to use NHS treatments. The Alpha-Stim AID device has the potential to increase choice which in turn could mean improving access. Many people have negative thoughts of antidepressants and may also have negative experiences of psychotherapy. Therefore, they deny themselves treatment. Given the high volume of patients with depression [27] but the high rate of spontaneous remission and responsiveness to first-line antidepressant treatments, we think the likely place for Alpha-Stim AID would be the primary care clinical pathway. It could be for patients with moderate to severe depression who have not responded to a first-line antidepressant given at a therapeutic dose for 6 weeks or more or those who have been offered an antidepressant but are unwilling to take it, or unable to tolerate it. Such patients are unlikely to remit, justifying the use of an alternative treatment approach such as Alpha-Stim AID should it prove clinically effective in this research. It could also be a more favourable treatment option for patients from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not wish to or may be less readily able to access psychological therapy. Alpha-Stim AID is now starting to become established for the treatment of anxiety through direct sale to the public but it is also CE marked for direct sale to the public for\ndepression with evidence only of effectiveness against depression symptoms in people with primary anxiety disorders. There is an urgent need to address depression in young people and adults because of the increased presentation of patients with depression in primary care, reflected in the rising use of antidepressants to 71 million prescriptions in 2018 in England [34] and the rising demand for talking therapies but also evidence of a rising demand for other effective alternatives. Alpha-Stim AID meets policy priorities for offering choice for the treatment of depression at a cost similar to antidepressants and at a lower cost than psychological treatment. However, most people who might benefit from this treatment cannot afford to pay for it. Hence, further research is required to explore its long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness for managing depression in NHS primary care. Following on from a successful RCT conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic by our research team using remote assessment, consent, treatment delivery and follow-up [35], we had already planned to use these methods in addition to face-to-face contact before the onset of the pandemic which severely restricted face-toface contact with patients for non-essential care, including a period of 6 months when the recruitment to this study was delayed. With minimal changes to our protocol (delivery of the device directly to the patient\u2019s home and an instructional video rather than the GP practice providing delivery and instructions), we have been able to successfully deliver this trial despite a national lockdown on movement throughout most of the study period. Participants are now also familiar with videoconferencing in their private lives and as a means of consulting about their health. Therefore, when feasible and allowed by regulatory bodies, we will continue to use remote methods for many of our trials regardless of pandemic restrictions."
