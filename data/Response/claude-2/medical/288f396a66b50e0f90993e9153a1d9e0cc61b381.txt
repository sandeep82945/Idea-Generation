 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the long-term impacts of IRWH and intercropping over multiple growing seasons. The current study was limited to one drought year, so collecting multi-year data would provide more robust conclusions on the benefits of these practices. 

2. Test different crop varieties and combinations for intercropping systems. The yields and interactions of maize and beans could be optimized by experimenting with different crop genotypes suited for semi-arid conditions.

3. Evaluate the water use efficiency and water productivity in more detail. The paper mentions this as an area for further study, so measuring transpiration, soil evaporation, and water balances could quantify water savings with IRWH. 

4. Conduct an economic analysis of IRWH and intercropping. The costs and benefits could be analyzed to determine the profitability and incentives for farmers to adopt these practices. 

5. Develop crop simulation models to predict long-term yields. As mentioned in the paper, models like DSSAT and APSIM could simulate yields over many seasons with different climate scenarios to evaluate the resiliency of IRWH and intercropping.
