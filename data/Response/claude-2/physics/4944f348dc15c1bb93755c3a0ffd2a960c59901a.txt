 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study using QUEST MRI to assess oxidative stress in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS, and primary progressive MS. Track changes in oxidative stress over time and correlate with clinical outcomes. 

2. Evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of kex MRI for detecting smoldering lesions in patients with progressive MS compared to conventional MRI.

3. Use MEGA-PRESS MRS at 3T to measure glutathione levels in different MS subtypes and correlate with disability scores. Compare glutathione levels between lesions and normal appearing white matter.

4. Conduct a study using 62Cu-ATSM PET imaging to evaluate oxidative stress in early relapsing-remitting MS patients versus controls. Examine associations between oxidative stress levels and future disease progression.

5. Develop and test a novel PET radiotracer specific for detecting reactive oxygen species rather than hypoxia. Evaluate its accuracy in detecting oxidative stress in an animal model of MS.
