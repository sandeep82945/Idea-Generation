 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the specific compounds and mechanisms responsible for the potent antioxidant activity of Gerês propolis extracts. Isolate and identify the key antioxidant constituents through methods like HPLC and test their individual radical scavenging capacities. 

2. Examine the antibacterial efficacy of Gerês propolis extracts against a wider panel of clinically relevant bacterial strains, including other drug-resistant pathogens. Assess the extracts' ability to potentiate conventional antibiotics.

3. Evaluate the anticancer potential of Gerês propolis extracts in vitro using cancer cell lines and in vivo using animal models. Identify the anticancer compounds and study their mechanisms of action.

4. Formulate Gerês propolis extracts into novel delivery systems (e.g. nanoparticles, microemulsions, films) to improve their stability, bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Test the delivery systems in vitro and in vivo. 

5. Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the health benefits of Gerês propolis extracts in humans. Assess antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in patients through biomarkers and clinical outcomes.
