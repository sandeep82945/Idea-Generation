    "abstractText": "We report on a phenomenological analysis of all available electron scattering data on C (about 6600 differential cross section measurements) and on O (about 250 measurements) within the framework of the quasielastic (QE) superscaling model (including Pauli blocking). All QE and inelastic cross section measurements are included down to the lowest momentum transfer q (including photoproduction data). We find that there is enhancement of the transverse QE response function (R T ) and quenching of the QE longitudinal response function (R L ) at low q (in addition to Pauli blocking). We extract parametrizations of a multiplicative low q \u201clongitudinal quenching factor\u201d and an additive \u201ctransverse enhancement\u201d contribution. Additionally, we find that the excitation of nuclear states contribute significantly (up to 30%) to the Coulomb sum rule SL(q). We extract the most accurate determination of SL(q) to date and find it to be in disagreement with random phase approximation (RPA) based calculations but in reasonable agreement with recent theoretical calculations, such as \u201cfirst principle Green\u2019s function Monte Carlo.\u201d",

Bodek 1,* and M. E. Christy2 1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14627, USA\n2Thomas Jeferson National Accelerator Facility, Newport News, Virginia 23606, USA\n(Received 1 September 2022; accepted 26 October 2022; published 19 December 2022)\nWe report on a phenomenological analysis of all available electron scattering data on 12C (about 6600 differential cross section measurements) and on 16O (about 250 measurements) within the framework of the quasielastic (QE) superscaling model (including Pauli blocking). All QE and inelastic cross section measurements are included down to the lowest momentum transfer q (including photoproduction data).

The cross section measurements include the available data on QE [down to the lowest momentum transfer q (\u2261 | q|)], inelastic production, and photoproduction. The fit includes inelastic structure functions and empirical parameters to model both an enhancement of the transverse (T) QE response function RQET and quenching of the longitudinal (L) QE response function RQEL at low q. As the fit provides an accurate description of all available data, it can be used as a proxy to validate modeling of cross sections in Monte Carlo event generators for electron and neutrino (\u03bde,\u03bc) scattering. Careful consideration of nuclear excitations is critical for an accurate extraction of the normalized Coulomb sum rule [1] SL(q) at low q as these states can contribute up to 29%. After accounting for the dominant excitations, we extract the most accurate determination of SL(q)) as function of q for 12C and 16O based on the global fit and compare to theoretical models. In addition, the \u201ctransverse enhancement\u201d (TE) of RQET and the \u201cquenching factor\u201d of RQEL are also of great interest to \u03bde,\u03bc scattering experiments [2\u20135].\n*bodek@pas.rochester.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Funded by SCOAP3.\nThe electron scattering differential cross section can be written [6] in terms of RL(q, \u03bd) and RT (q, \u03bd) as\nd2\u03c3\nd\u03bd d = \u03c3M[ARL(q, \u03bd) + BRT (q, \u03bd)],\n\u03c3M = \u03b12 cos2(\u03b8/2)/ [ 4E20 sin 4(\u03b8/2) ] . (1)\nHere, E0 is the incident electron energy, E \u2032 and \u03b8 are energy and angle of the final state electron, \u03bd = E0 \u2212 E \u2032, Q2 is the square of the four-momentum transfer (defined to be positive), q2 = Q2 + \u03bd2, A = (Q2/q2)2, and B = tan2(\u03b8/2) + Q2/2q2. In the analysis we also use the invariant hadronic mass W 2 = M2p + 2Mp\u03bd \u2212 Q2.\nThe inelastic Coulomb sum rule is the integral of RL(q, \u03bd)d\u03bd, excluding the elastic peak and pion production processes. It has contributions from QE scattering and from electroexcitations of nuclear states:\nCSR(q) = \u222b\nRL(q, \u03bd)d\u03bd\n= \u222b RQEL (q, \u03bd)d\u03bd + G\u20322E (Q2) \u00d7 Z2 L\u2211 all F 2i (q)\n= G\u20322E (Q2) \u00d7 [ Z \u222b\nV QEL (q, \u03bd)d\u03bd + Z2 L\u2211 all F 2i (q)\n] .\n(2)\nWe define V QE (q, \u03bd) as the reduced longitudinal QE response, which integrates to unity in the absence of any suppression (e.g., Pauli blocking). The charge form factors for the electroexcitation of nuclear states F 2iC (q) are G 2 E p(Q 2) \u00d7 F 2i (q).\n2469-9985/2022/106(6)/L061305(7) L061305-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nIn order to account for the small contribution of the neutron and relativistic effects, G\u20322E (Q 2) is given by [6]\nG\u20322E (Q 2) = [ G2E p(Q\n2) + N Z G2En(Q 2)\n] 1 + \u03c4\n1 + 2\u03c4 , (3)\nwhere GE p and GEn are the electric form factors [7] of the proton and neutron respectively and \u03c4 = Q2/4M2p. By dividing Eq. (2) by ZG\u20322E q) we obtain the normalized inelastic Coulomb sum rule SL(q):\nSL(q) = \u222b V QEL (q, \u03bd)d\u03bd + Z L\u2211 all F 2i (q). (4)\nAt high q it is expected that SL \u2192 1 because both nuclear excitation form factors and Pauli suppression are small. At small q it is expected that SL \u2192 0 because all form factors for inelastic processes (QE and nuclear excitations) must be zero at q = 0.\nWe begin by parametrizing the measurements of the L and T form factors for the electroexcitation of all nuclear states in 12C with excitation energies (Ex) less than 16.0 MeV (the approximate proton removal energy from 12C). For these states the measurements are straightforward since the QE cross section is zero for Ex < 16 MeV.\nFor Ex > 16 MeV the extractions of form factors require corrections for the QE contribution. We perform a reanalysis of all published cross sections with in Ex < 55 MeV and use our fitted QE model (described below) to extract L and T form factors. For Ex > 20 MeV (region of the giant dipole resonances) we group the strength from multiple excitations into a few states with a large width Ex and extract effective form factors accounting for all states in this region. The top two panels of Fig. 1 show comparisons of our fit (red) to RL measurements by Yamaguchi (blue) 1996 [8] with Ex > 14 MeV. An estimated resolution smearing of 600 keV has been applied to the excitations in the fit to match the data. While individual states are well reproduced at low excitation energy, above 20 MeV the effect of grouping several excitations together into broad effective states in the fit can be seen. While the fit does not capture the structure from individual states, the total strength is well reproduced. A similar analysis has been done for 16O.\nThe contribution of nuclear excitation to SL(q) [factor Z \u2211L all F 2 i (q) in Eq. (4)] is calculated using the parametrizations of the form factors. The bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the contributions of nuclear excitations to SL(q) for 12C. The contribution of all excitations is largest (\u2248 0.29) at q = 0.22 GeV. Although the contributions of different Ex regions to SL(q) is different for 12C and 16O, the total contribution turns out to be similar for the two nuclei. The total contribution of excitations to SL(q) in 12C can be parametrized as:\nZ L\u2211 all F 2i (q) = N1e\u2212(x\u2212C1 ) 2/D21\n+ N2e\u2212(x\u2212C2 )2/D22 + N3e\u2212(x\u2212C3 )2/D23 , (5) where x = q/KF (KF = 0.228 GeV); N1 = 0.260, C1 = 1.11, D1 = 0.50; N2 = 0.075, C2 = 0.730, D2 = 0.30; and N3 =\nL061305-2\n0.01, C3 = 2.0, D3 = 0.30. The uncertainty in the total contribution of excited states was estimated to be 15% plus a systematic error to account for the choice of parametrization at very low q (\u00b10.01) added in quadrature. The universal fit to the 12C data is an update of the 2012 fit by Bosted and Mamyan [9]. The QE contribution is modeled by the superscaling approach [10\u201313] with Pauli blocking calculated using the Rosenfelder [13\u201315] method. The superscaling function extracted from the fit is similar to the superscaling functions of Amaro 2005 [11] and Amaro 2020 [12] and yields similar Pauli suppression.\nIn modeling the QE response we use the same scaling function for both RQEL (q, \u03bd) and R QE T (q, \u03bd) and fit for empirical corrections to the response functions. For RQET we extract an additive \u201ctransverse enhancement/Meson Exchange Currents (MEC)\u2019\u2019 TE(q, \u03bd) contribution (which includes both single nucleon and two nucleon final states). As shown in Ref. [16]. TE(q, \u03bd) increases RQET with the largest fractional contribution around Q2 = 0.3 GeV2. For RQEL we extract a multiplicative q dependent \u201clongitudinal quenching factor,\u201d Fquench(q), which decreases RQEL at low q.\nSince d 2\u03c3\nd d\u03bd measurements span a large range of \u03b8 and q, parametrizations of both TE(q, \u03bd) and F Lquench(q) can be extracted. The analysis includes all data for a large range of nuclei. However, in this paper we only include data on 12C and 16O. Briefly, the updated fit includes\n(1) All electron scattering data on 1H, 2H, 12C, and 16O in addition to the data in the QE [17] and resonance [18] data archives. (2) Coulomb corrections [19] using the effective momentum approximation (EMA) in modeling scattering from nuclear targets. (3) Updated nuclear elastic+excitations form factors. (4) Superscaling FN (\u03c8 \u2032) parameters are reextracted in-\ncluding the Fermi broadening parameter KF . (5) Parametrizations of the free nucleon form factors [20]\nare rederived from all 1H and 2H data. (6) Rosenfelder Pauli suppression [13\u201315], which re-\nduces and changes the QE distribution at low q and \u03bd. (7) Updates of fits [20] to inelastic electron scattering data (in the nucleon resonance region and inelastic continuum) for 1H and 2H. (8) A q dependent EQEshift (q) parameter for the QE process to account for the optical potential [21] of final state nucleons. (9) Photoproduction data in the nucleon resonance region and inelastic continuum [22]. (10) Gaussian Fermi smeared nucleon resonance and inelastic continuum [22]. The KF parameters for pion production and QE can be different. (11) Parametrizations of the medium modifications of both the L and T structure functions responsible for the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) effect (nuclear dependence of inelastic structure functions). These are applied to the free nucleon cross sections prior to application of the Fermi smearing.\n(12) Parametizations of TE(q, \u03bd) and F Lquench(q) as described below. (13) QE data at all values of Q2 down to Q2 = 0.01 GeV2 (q = 0.1 GeV) (which were not included in the Bosted-Mamyan fit).\nThe average (over \u03bd) Pauli suppression factor for x < 2.5 (x = q/KF , KF = 0.228 GeV) is described by\n\u2329 F This-analysisPauli (q) \u232a = j=3\u2211 j=0 k j (x) j . (6)\nUsing the Rosenfeld method with superscaling function used in this analysis, we find ko = 0.3054, k1 = 0.7647, k2 = \u22120.2768, and k3 = 0.0328. The Pauli suppression factor for x > 2.5 is 1.0.\nComparisons of the fit to electron scattering d 2\u03c3\nd d\u03bd measurements [17,23,24] at different values of \u03b8 for q values close to 0.30, 0.38, and 0.57 GeV (corresponding to extractions of RL and RT by Jourdan [25]) are shown in Fig. 2. Shown are the total d\n2\u03c3 d d\u03bd cross section (solid magenta line), the total minus\nthe contribution of nuclear excitations (dot-dashed green), the QE cross section without TE (dashed blue), the TE contribution (thin solid red), and inelastic pion production (dot-dashed black). An estimated resolution smearing of 3.5 MeV has been applied to the excitations to better match the data.\nThe fit is in good agreement with all electron scattering data for both small and large \u03b8 .\nThe extracted QE \u201clongitudinal quenching factor\u201d F Lquench(q) is unity for x > 3.75, and is zero for x < 0.35. For 0.35 < x < 4.0 it is parametrized by\nF Lquench(q) = (x \u2212 0.2)2\n(x \u2212 0.18)2 [1.0 + A1(3.75 \u2212 x) 1.5\n+ A2(3.75 \u2212 x)2.5 + A3(3.75 \u2212 x)3.5] (7) with A1 = \u22120.13152, A2 = 0.11693, and A3 = \u22120.03675. The top-left panel of Fig. 3 shows the extracted F Lquench(q). (black dotted line). The yellow band includes the statistical, parametrization and a normalization error of 2% (all added in quadrature).\nIf another formalism is used to model QE scattering (e.g., Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) or spectral functions) then the quenching factor for the model F L-modelquench (q) is given by\nF L-modelquench (q) = \u2329 F This-analysisPauli (q) \u232a \u2329 F modelPauli (q)\n\u232a F Lquench(q) (8) The top right panel of Fig. 3 shows the various contributions to the measured SL(q) for 12C (dotted blue line with yellow error band). Shown are the QE contribution with only Pauli suppression (dotted purple), QE suppressed by both \u201cPauli suppression\u201d and F Lquench(q) labeled as QE total suppression (solid green), and the contribution of nuclear excitations (red dashed line). The green error band is 15% plus 0.01 added in quadrature.\nThe left panel on the bottom of Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the extracted SL(q) for 12C (dotted blue curve with yellow error band) to theoretical calculations. These include the Lovato 2016 [27] \u2018first principle Green\u2019s function\nL061305-3\nd d\u03bd (solid purple line), total minus the contribution of the nuclear excitations (solid blue), the\nQE cross section without TE (dashed blue), the TE contribution (solid red), and inelastic pion production (dot-dashed black line). Additional comparisons are included in Supplemental Material [26].\nMonte Carlo\u201d (GFMC) calculation (solid purple line), Mihaila 2000 [28] coupled-clusters based calculation (AV18+UIX potential, dashed green), and Cloet 2016 [29] RPA calculation (RPA solid red). Our measurements for 12C are in disagreement with Cloet 2016 RPA, and in reasonable agreement with Lovato 2016 and Mihaila 2000 except near q \u2248 0.30 GeV where the contribution from nuclear excitations is significant.\nThere are not enough QE data for 16O to perform a complete analysis. We find that the QE fit parameters for 12C also describe all available data on 16O. A difference in SL(q) between 12C and 16O could be the contribution of nuclear excitations. However we find that the contributions of nuclear excitations to the SL(q) for 12C and 16O are consistent with being equal.\nThe bottom right panel of Fig. 3 shows SL(q) for 16O (dotted blue with green error band) compared to theoretical calculations. These include the Sobczyk 2020 [30] \u201ccoupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) NNLOsat\u201d (red\ndashed line), and Mihaila 2000 [28] coupled-cluster calculation with AV18+UIX potential (dashed green line). The data are in reasonable agreement with Sobczyk 2020 and Mihaila 2000 calculations for 16O except near q \u2248 0.30 GeV where the contribution from nuclear excitations is significant.\nThe TE(q, \u03bd) contribution to the QE transverse structure function F1(q, \u03bd) for 12C is parameterized as a distorted Gaussian centered around W \u2248 0.88 GeV and a second Gaussian at W \u2248 1.2 GeV [31] with Q2 dependent width and amplitude. F MEC1 = 0 for \u03bd < \u03bdmin (\u03bdmin = 16.5 MeV). For \u03bd > \u03bdmin it is given by\nF MEC1 = max [( f A1 + f B1 ) , 0.0 ] ,\nf A1 = a1Y [( W 2 \u2212 W 2min )1.5 e\u2212(W 2\u2212b1 )2/2c21],\nf B1 = a2Y ( Q2 + q2o )1.5[ e\u2212(W 2\u2212b2 )2/2c22], L061305-4\nY = Ae\u2212Q4/12.715 ( Q2 + q20 )2 (0.13380 + Q2)6.90679 ,\na1 = 0.091 648, a2 = 0.10223, W 2min = M2p + 2Mp\u03bdmin \u2212 Q2, (9)\nwhere Q2 is in units of GeV2, Mp is the proton mass, A is the atomic weight, q20 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124, b1 = 0.77023, c1 = 0.077051 + 0.26795Q2, b2 = 1.275, and c2 = 0.375.\nThe parameters of the empirical model of TE(q, \u03bd) in electron scattering can be used to predict the TE(q, \u03bd) contribution in neutrino scattering [32].\nA comparison between our extraction (thick solid blue) of RL(q, \u03bd) and RT (q, \u03bd) and the extraction (for only three values of q) by Jourdan [25] (data points) are shown in Fig. 4. At the lowest q our RL(q, \u03bd) is somewhat lower and our RT (q, \u03bd) is somewhat higher (the Jourdan analysis includes data from only two experiments). Also shown\nare two one-body + two-body (1b+2b) current calculations: GFMC [27] and \u201cenergy-dependent relativistic mean field\u201d (ED-RMF) [33]. In our fit, we show each nuclear excitation with excitation energy Ex at \u03bd = Ex + q2/2MC12, where MC12 is the mass of the carbon nucleus. In contrast, the ED-RMF calculations group all excitations in two fixed \u03bd peaks as shown in Fig. 4, and the GFMC calculations do not show any nuclear excitations. Both calculations are in reasonable agreement with our analysis in the QE region. In both models there is enhancement of RQET (q, \u03bd) if only 1b currents are included and additional enhancement if both 1b and 2b currents are included. The curves labeled 2b in Fig. 4 show the enhancement in RQET (q, \u03bd) from 2b currents only [i.e., (1b+2b) minus (1b only)], while our empirical extraction of TE(q, \u03bd) shown in Fig. 4 models the enhancement in RT (q, \u03bd) from all sources.\nIn summary, using all available electron scattering data we extract parametrizations of the quenching of the RQEL (q, \u03bd)\nL061305-5\nand the enhancement of RQET (q, \u03bd) over a large range of q and \u03bd. We obtain the best measurement of the Coulomb sum rule SL(q) to date and compare to theoretical models. The contribution of nuclear excitations to SL(q) is significant (up to 29%). Theoretical studies show that nuclear excitations are also significant in \u03bde,\u03bc scattering [34,35]. Therefore, nuclear\nexcitations should be included in both e-N and \u03bd-N MC generators.\nThis Research is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, under University of Rochester Grant No. DE-SC0008475, and the Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics under Contract No. DE-AC05-06OR23177.\n[1] D.
