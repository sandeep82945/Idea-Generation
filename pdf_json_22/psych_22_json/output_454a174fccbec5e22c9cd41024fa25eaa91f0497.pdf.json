    "abstractText": "29 Helpline services have been identified as an important component of suicide prevention 30 strategies. While the Covid-19 pandemic have raised major concerns about severe and 31 longstanding mental health consequences, the French ministry of Health has recently decided 32 to implement a national professional helpline dedicated to suicide prevention. The 3114 has 33 been launched on the 1st of October 2021. Accessible 24/7 from any point of the national 34 territory, it offers remote assistance to individuals in distress or worried for a close one, 35 professionals and bereaved persons. Spread in regional call centers, medically supervised 36 nurses and psychologists provide callers with listening, evaluation, intervention (including 37 possible dispatch of a rescue team) and, whenever needed, referral to adapted services. At the 38 same time, the \u201c3114 centers\u201d contribute to the implementation of the regional suicide 39 prevention strategies by stimulating the development of actions, promoting resources, 40 monitoring at-risk events, and collaborating with professional and associative stakeholders. 41 From a public health perspective, the inception of the 3114 has settled the conditions for a new 42 paradigm in the French suicide prevention strategy. By dedicating specific resources to promote 43 and organize interactions between stakeholders, it supports a major shift from the juxtaposition 44 of efficient but segregated actions to the creation of an integrated prevention system. Embedded 45 to the project, multidisciplinary and multilevel research will be carried out to evaluate the 46 implementation, impact, and transferability of the 3114 model, conceived both as a helpline and 47 territorial prevention strategy. 48 https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press Accepted manuscript: Authors' Copy Despite a trend decline since the beginning of century, suicide rates in Europe remain 49 among the highest of WHO regions [1]. In the past ten years, France has consistently 50 belonged to the half of most impacted European countries [2]. In 2017, 8 214 French 51 individuals died by suicide [3]. Lately, strong concerns have emerged about the fact that 52 mental health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic may translate into longstanding 53 increases of suicide rates worldwide [4], and more specifically in Europe [5]. In France, 54 alarming indicators tend to support this hypothesis. For instance, from 2018-2019 to 2021, 55 admissions to the ED for suicidal ideations and suicide attempt in 11-17 yo adolescents \u2013 56 especially girls \u2013 have increased by about 130% and 30% respectively [6,7]. First figures 57 from 2022 suggest even more concerning patterns, with increases of suicidal behaviors rates 58 extending to older age classes [7]. 59 In line with the recommendation of the European Psychiatric Association that 60 \u201cunprecedented times are calling for unprecedented efforts\u201d [5], the French government has 61 recently decided to complete its national strategy for suicide prevention by implementing an 62 universal professional helpline service. Helplines are one of the historical pillars of suicide 63 prevention. In the 1950\u2019s, Samaritans have inaugurated in Great Britain a massive spread of 64 telephone help services across the world. Based on an important \u2013 although methodological 65 fragile \u2013 corpus of evidence supporting their efficacy [8], helplines are now recommended as 66 an important selective component of suicide prevention strategies [9]. 67 In France, local and national suicide-prevention helplines have burgeoned since the 68 1960\u2019s. Almost all consisted in trained volunteers providing distressed callers a non-directive 69 listening. Recently, national instances remarked the lack of a complementary professional 70 service able to provide distressed individuals more proactive and evidenced-based remote 71 evaluation and preventive interventions. More specifically, the absence of referral to mental 72 health professionals was identified as a missed opportunity to promote and facilitate access to 73 https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press Accepted manuscript: Authors' Copy care. In addition, the only way of getting immediate help in case of acute suicidal crisis was 74 by calling the general emergency numbers, with non-optimal responses due to shortage of 75 specialized skills. Finally, numerous suicide prevention actors called for a reliable, visible, 76 and unified national professional helpline as a resource to promote in the community, 77 broadcast in the media, spread on the web, and display on hotspots. 78 To fulfill the gap, the 3114, French national helpline for suicide prevention, has been 79 launched by the French minister of health on the 1st of October 2021. Freely accessible 24 80 hours a day and 7 days a week from any part of the country including overseas territories, it 81 targets any individual needing assistance about suicidal issues, which encompasses (a) 82 distressed persons, ranging from emerging suicidal ideations to acute crisis, (b) persons 83 worried about a close one, (c) professionals needing information or advice and (d) persons 84 bereaved by suicide. 85 The development and implementation or the 3114 are coordinated by the \u201cNational 86 pole\u201d of the 3114, a federative organization hosted by the University Hospital of Lille which 87 closely collaborates with various experts, institutions, and associations. The French ministry 88 of Health, which funds the project, steers its general orientation, and ensures its conformity 89 with the current regulatory framework. 90 From the operational point of view, the French national helpline has a decentralized 91 organization. The regional spread of \u201c3114 centers\u201d (1 to 2 per region) allows for proximal 92 responses and accurate knowledge of local resources. These centers host the \u201crespondents\u201d of 93 the 3114, i.e. nurses and psychologists placed under the supervision of a senior psychiatrist. 94 Respondents as well as supervisors received a specifically designed training based on an 95 expert consensus and evidence-grounded practices. The remote professional help they offer 96 consists in: (a) non-judgmental and empathic listening, with the objective of rapidly creating, 97 reinforcing, and maintaining an alliance with the caller; (b) a targeted clinical evaluation, 98 https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press Accepted manuscript: Authors' Copy which comprises an estimation of the suicide risk, the identification of salient 99 psychopathological signs and symptoms and an assessment of the psychosocial context; (c) a 100 strategical intervention, which may include counselling, motivational reinforcement and/or 101 problem solving. The objective is to bring a first relief, commit the caller to the caring process 102 and mobilize his/her personal and external resources. (d) referral to adapted sanitary (i.e. 103 general practitioner, psychiatric services or emergency room), welfare, social or associative 104 resources, with the possibility to program a follow-up contact. A tight collaboration with 105 emergency services allows for dispatching a rescue team whenever the caller is estimated in 106 immediate danger. Also, in a global care perspective, respondents are supported by a social 107 worker when financial needs, housing problems, educative precarity or difficulties in 108 accessing social rights are identified. 109 Beyond this distant help activity, the 3114 regional centers also have a territorial 110 mission. Thanks to social workers and network managers, they contribute promoting available 111 suicide prevention actions, federating stakeholders, monitoring the occurrence of at-risk 112 events (e.g., hot spots), reducing territorial and social inequalities and stimulating the 113 development of innovations under the pilotage of Regional Health Agencies. The structure, 114 missions, and actions of the 3114 are summarized in Figure 1. 115 The launch of the 3114 have been supported by an intensive communication campaign 116 with diffusion of print and digital flyers, collaboration with journalists, organization of 117 webinars with local actors, promotion by national institutions and active social media 118 publications. A specifically designed website (www.3114.fr) have been developed to provide 119 the general population with various specified information, advice and resources about suicidal 120 behaviors and prevention. 121 The implementation of the 3114 represents a turning point for suicide prevention in 122 France. In eight months of existence, it already received about 90,000 calls ranging from early 123 https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press Accepted manuscript: Authors' Copy prevention for mild distress without suicidal ideation to acute suicidal crisis needing 124 immediate rescue. Complementary to associative services, it ensures tailored responses based 125 on tight articulations with healthcare service, which has been pinpointed as a key condition to 126 reduce suicide rates [10]. The implantation of the 3114 regional centers also represents a 127 strong opportunity to put in synergy prevention actors and actions in accordance with local 128 needs, thus helping to concretely translate the WHO recommendations for a multilevel (i.e. 129 combining targeted, indicated and universal actions), multisectoral (i.e. base of the 130 cooperation of the sanitary, associative, social and community sectors), multidisciplinary (i.e. 131 appealing to various disciplines such as biomedicine, epidemiology, sociology, etc.) and 132 multimodal (i.e. combining modalities of actions such as communication, healthcare, training, 133 etc.) prevention strategy. In that, the 3114 swings French prevention into a new paradigm, 134 from animating multiple efficient but juxtaposed actions (such as the brief contact 135 intervention system VigilanS [11]) to shaping a coherent territorialized prevention ensemble. 136 Importantly, the 3114 is still at an inception stage. Developments are ongoing to reach 137 a mature, stabilized system: opening of the last call centers, consolidation of the digital and 138 technical solutions, implementation of a continued training for responders and supervisors, 139 improvement of work conditions, reinforcement of inter-centers collaborations, strengthening 140 of the access for the undeserved and people living with a disability, promotion of deeper 141 territorial anchoring, stepping-up of networking activities and leveling-up of the 142 communication strategy for greater local and national visibility. On top of these routine 143 developments, the National Pole and the French ministry of Solidarity and Heath have already 144 anticipated major evolutions for the 3114. Among those, the opening of a 24/7 online chat is 145 intended to broaden the spectrum of reached populations both in terms of socio-demographic 146 (especially towards youth) and clinical characteristics. In a further effort to support the 147 development of a national digital prevention strategy, the 3114 may also open a social 148 https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press Accepted manuscript: Authors' Copy network channel, so as people can contact respondents directly from their daily 149 communication apps. Because such innovation is highly sensitive from a technological, 150 regulatory, and ethical point of view, the National Pole will rely on insights from the Elios 151 project, a national randomized control trial assessing the efficacy of allowing suicidal young 152 adults to get a direct contact with web-clinicians through Instagram and Messenger [12]. 153 Given its key role in the French public health strategy for suicide prevention, it is 154 crucial to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of the 3114, both as a hotline and a 155 territorial prevention actor. As respect to distal indicators, the national all-at-once 156 implementation represents both an opportunity and a hurdle to impute observed changes to the 157 service: on the one hand, it allows for observing the time trends of suicidal behaviors 158 precisely before and after the launching date, on the other hand, it prevents any comparison 159 with equivalent non-covered territory. However, as noticed by Hoffberg et al., evaluation of 160 crisis lines is a multi-faceted area covering much more than the reduction of suicidal behavior 161 [8]. To meet this challenge, the National Pole intends to broaden its research interest and 162 implement several studies based on collected data and metadata. The following protocols are 163 already planned: (1) description of calls and callers\u2019 characteristics producing follow-up 164 indicators, (2) medico-economic evaluation of the cost of suicidal behavior and comparison to 165 the period preceding the opening of the service, (3) embedded monitoring of the respondents\u2019 166 mental health \u2013 the final aim being the production of recommendations to promote better 167 quality of life for the professionals, (4) sociological observations that will help drawing 168 lessons from the 3114 about the socio-cultural determinants, political constrains and 169 contextual leverages or obstacles to be taken in account when implementing such a broad and 170 complex prevention project, (5) assessment of the opinion and representations of the service 171 users as well as upstream and downstream partners in order to improve the acceptability of the 172 3114. Of note, systematically collected data will be also made available to external research 173 https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press Accepted manuscript: Authors' Copy teams upon application. Overall, the idea is to shed light on the relevance of the 3114 model, 174 but also on the transferability of this model to other contexts and countries. 175 https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press Accepted manuscript: Authors' Copy",

The implantation of the 3114 regional centers also represents a 127 strong opportunity to put in synergy prevention actors and actions in accordance with local 128 needs, thus helping to concretely translate the WHO recommendations for a multilevel (i.e. 129 combining targeted, indicated and universal actions), multisectoral (i.e. base of the 130 cooperation of the sanitary, associative, social and community sectors), multidisciplinary (i.e. 131 appealing to various disciplines such as biomedicine, epidemiology, sociology, etc.) and 132 multimodal (i.e. combining modalities of actions such as communication, healthcare, training, 133 etc.) prevention strategy. In that, the 3114 swings French prevention into a new paradigm, 134 from animating multiple efficient but juxtaposed actions (such as the brief contact 135 intervention system VigilanS [11]) to shaping a coherent territorialized prevention ensemble. 136 Importantly, the 3114 is still at an inception stage. Developments are ongoing to reach 137 a mature, stabilized system: opening of the last call centers, consolidation of the digital and 138 technical solutions, implementation of a continued training for responders and supervisors, 139 improvement of work conditions, reinforcement of inter-centers collaborations, strengthening 140 of the access for the undeserved and people living with a disability, promotion of deeper 141 territorial anchoring, stepping-up of networking activities and leveling-up of the 142 communication strategy for greater local and national visibility. On top of these routine 143 developments, the National Pole and the French ministry of Solidarity and Heath have already 144 anticipated major evolutions for the 3114. Among those, the opening of a 24/7 online chat is 145 intended to broaden the spectrum of reached populations both in terms of socio-demographic 146 (especially towards youth) and clinical characteristics. In a further effort to support the 147 development of a national digital prevention strategy, the 3114 may also open a social 148\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ncommunication apps. Because such innovation is highly sensitive from a technological, 150 regulatory, and ethical point of view, the National Pole will rely on insights from the Elios 151 project, a national randomized control trial assessing the efficacy of allowing suicidal young 152 adults to get a direct contact with web-clinicians through Instagram and Messenger [12]. 153 Given its key role in the French public health strategy for suicide prevention, it is 154 crucial to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of the 3114, both as a hotline and a 155 territorial prevention actor. As respect to distal indicators, the national all-at-once 156 implementation represents both an opportunity and a hurdle to impute observed changes to the 157 service: on the one hand, it allows for observing the time trends of suicidal behaviors 158 precisely before and after the launching date, on the other hand, it prevents any comparison 159 with equivalent non-covered territory. However, as noticed by Hoffberg et al., evaluation of 160 crisis lines is a multi-faceted area covering much more than the reduction of suicidal behavior 161 [8]. To meet this challenge, the National Pole intends to broaden its research interest and 162 implement several studies based on collected data and metadata. The following protocols are 163 already planned: (1) description of calls and callers\u2019 characteristics producing follow-up 164 indicators, (2) medico-economic evaluation of the cost of suicidal behavior and comparison to 165 the period preceding the opening of the service, (3) embedded monitoring of the respondents\u2019 166 mental health \u2013 the final aim being the production of recommendations to promote better 167 quality of life for the professionals, (4) sociological observations that will help drawing 168 lessons from the 3114 about the socio-cultural determinants, political constrains and 169 contextual leverages or obstacles to be taken in account when implementing such a broad and 170 complex prevention project, (5) assessment of the opinion and representations of the service 171 users as well as upstream and downstream partners in order to improve the acceptability of the 172 3114. Of note, systematically collected data will be also made available to external research 173\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nbut also on the transferability of this model to other contexts and countries. 175\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2318 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nAcknowledgements.
