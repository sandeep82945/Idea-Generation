"In our experiments, 2x spatial scale factor is used between the base layer and enhanced layer, because SVC usually needs a smaller scale factor for better quality [18]. Depending on video contents, AV1 SVC encoding may present different quality metrics compared with conventional single layer encoding, but the gap (PSNR) is acceptable in our case - even in the worst case, PSNR gap is less than 1dB (typically 0.5dB). This work paves the way for the most efficient viewport-dependent streaming of 360-degree videos, in terms of interactive latency, coding performance, and architecture."
