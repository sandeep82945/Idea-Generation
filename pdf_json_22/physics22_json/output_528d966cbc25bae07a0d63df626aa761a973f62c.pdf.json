    "abstractText": "Cryogenic semiconductor device models are essential in designing control systems for quantum devices and in benchmarking the benefits of cryogenic cooling for high-performance computing. In particular, the saturation of subthreshold swing due to band tails is an important phenomenon to include in lowtemperature analytical MOSFET models as it predicts theoretical lower bounds on the leakage power and supply voltage in tailored cryogenic CMOS technologies with tuned threshold voltages. Previous physics-based modeling required to evaluate functions with no closed-form solutions, defeating the purpose of fast and efficient model evaluation. Thus far, only the empirically proposed expressions are in closed form. This article bridges this gap by deriving a physics-based and closed-form model for the full saturating trend of the subthreshold swing from room down to low temperature. The proposed model is compared against experimental data taken on some long and short devices from a commercial 28-nm bulk CMOS technology down to 4.2 K.",

INTRODUCTION\nIN recent years, cryo-CMOS has emerged as the leadingcandidate for controlling quantum devices due to its proven performance down to deep-cryogenic temperatures and its potential for monolithic integration with quantum bits [1]\u2013 [3]. Other cutting-edge physics experiments, like gravitational wave or dark matter detection, can also benefit from the increased attention for cryo-CMOS devices and circuits [4], [5]. Furthermore, datacenters could benefit from advanced CMOS technologies tailored to cryogenic operation [6], [7].\nSteepness of the transistor switching between ON- and OFFstates at cryogenic temperatures is an essential performance metric for the aforementioned applications. In a MOSFET, the inverse slope of the subthreshold current in log10-scale, a.k.a. subthreshold swing, SS, is expected to scale linearly with temperature (T ), following Boltzmann\u2019s thermal limit,\nSS (T\u226bTc) = m \u00b7 kBT\nq \u00b7 ln(10), (1)\nwhere m is the subthreshold-slope factor, kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, and q is the electron charge.\nHowever, SS deviates from this linear scaling around a certain critical temperature, Tc, typically around 50K. In previous literature [8]\u2013[10], SS has been shown to saturate to a temperature-independent plateau below Tc,\nSS (T\u226aTc) = m \u00b7 kBTc q \u00b7 ln(10), (2)\nThe authors are with imec, Leuven, Belgium (arnout.beckers@imec.be). B. Parvais is also with the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. K. De Greve is also with KU Leuven. J. Michl was with the Institute for Microelectronics, TU Vienna, Austria, at the time of initial submission.\nwhere Tc links to the characteristic exponential decay of a band tail, i.e., Wt,c = kBTc. Such band tails have already been demonstrated experimentally using electron-spin resonance in silicon MOS devices at 370mK [11]. Interface and source/drain engineering give SS closer to the thermal limit [12], [13]. Besides band tails, direct source-to-drain tunneling is an additional explanation for saturation of SS at cryogenic temperatures in short devices [14], [15].\nLimits (1) and (2) are physics-based models, but they cover only part of the T -domain. To capture the full saturating trend across Tc, different models are being used. The physicsbased models numerically integrate the Fermi-Dirac integrals with exponential density-of-states [8], [10], or use Gauss hypergeometric functions [9], which are not of closed form and thus difficult to implement in compact models. On the other hand, suitable curve fits are available connecting the two limits, e.g., \u221d ln(1+ ex) [(7), [10]] or \u221d \u221a 1 + x2 [(9), [16]].\nFrom (1) and (2) it is clear that a Tc/T -dependence must appear out of the physics derivation to complete the transition below Tc in a full T -range model. Such a \u221d 1/T -dependence has been postulated since 1985 [17] but is nowadays often inserted empirically in the Boltzmann limit with the help of an effective slope factor [18], [19] or an effective temperature [16]. It has not been derived in a physical model thus far. The closest attempt were the discrete trap states close to the band edge in [20] which gave a \u221d 1/T -dependence at the state energy. This \u221d 1/T must also follow from a physics-based derivation for a continuous tail of states close to the band edge. In this article, such a Tc/T -dependence is derived inside a physics-based and closed-form model for SS covering the whole temperature domain from \u2248 0K to 300K (Section II). We explore the sensitivity of the physical model parameters and compare the model with experimental data (Section III)."

            "text": "Fig. 1 clarifies, from left to right, the relation between the random potential in the channel of a MOSFET (assumed ntype) and the exponential tail in the density-of-states (DOS). Fig.1(a) shows a TEM picture of an older imec technology node with SiO2/HfO2/TiN gate stack [21]. Fig.1(b) shows the blurring of the conduction-band edge Ec(x) along a segment of the channel between x and x+\u2206x.\nFollowing [22], the random potential in the channel is characterized by a Gaussian distribution. It is indeed reasonable to assume a Gaussian distribution since, according to the\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n11 94\n3v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 4\nSe p\n20 23\ncentral limit theorem, the aggregate of a large number of independent random variables still has a normal distribution even if the variables are not normally distributed. The Gaussian distribution of the depths of the local potential wells in Ec(x),\nP (Ec) \u221d exp ( \u2212(Ec \u2212 Ec,\u00b5)2\n2\u03c32\n) (3)\nis centered around the average Ec,\u00b5 with a standard deviation of \u03c3 [Fig. 1(c)]. To obtain the smeared-out DOS with band tailing, the probability distribution must be convolved with the sharp-edged DOS (see entry \u201cH\u201d in Table I), that is,\nDOS(E) = DOSH \u229b P (Ec) (4)\n= \u222b E \u2212\u221e DOSH(E \u2212 Ec) \u00b7 P (Ec) \u00b7 dEc (5)\nwhere H stands for the Heaviside step function and \u229b stands for the convolution operation.\nHowever, this convolution with a Gaussian distribution does not give rise to an exponential tail immediately. The resulting DOS would have an error function shape with tail \u221d exp(\u2212x2) (see entry \u201cG\u201d in Table I). The exponential DOS(E) arises out of the quantum picture, where the binding energies of the local potential wells in Ec(x) are taken into account. Bacalis et al. found an approximately linear relation between the binding energy (Eb) and the square of the depth of the potential well for different types of wells : |Eb\u2212Ec,\u00b5| \u2243 A \u00b7 (Ec\u2212Ec,\u00b5)2\u2212 B [22]. Inserting this expression in (3), we obtain a Laplace distribution for the binding energies\nP (Eb) \u221d exp ( \u2212|Eb \u2212 Ec,\u00b5|\nkBTc\n) , (6)\nshown in Fig.1(d), where kBTc = 2A\u03c32. The convolution of the sharp DOS, shown in Fig.1(e), with (6) gives a logisticor Fermi-like distribution plotted in Fig. 1(f). The dashed line shows the exponential behavior below Ec,\u00b5, which is often referred to as a \u201cband tail\u201d. Note, in the semi-classical picture (i.e., no binding energies considered, hence no panel d in Fig.1), \u201cG\u201d would be obtained. The Gaussian tail gives a steeper subthreshold slope as shown in Fig. 2(a), due to a less fat tail since \u221d exp(\u2212x2) goes faster to zero than exp(\u2212x). Fig. 2(b) also checks that, for current values in subthreshold (\u2248 10\u22128A), it is sufficient to take into account the exponential\ntail of the DOS only, without the band states. This allows to derive a closed-form model for SS in the rest of the paper."

            "text": "The subthreshold swing is defined as\nSS \u225c \u2202VGS\n\u2202 log10(IDS) = IDS \u2202IDS \u2202VGS \u00b7 ln(10), (7)\nwhere IDS is the drain-source current in subthreshold and VGS is the gate-to-source voltage. The current flowing below Ec,\u00b5 would be accurately described by percolation theory [23]. The carriers percolate through the rugged potential landscape in Fig. 1(b). The band tail captures only the average effect of the potential fluctuations on the carriers traveling in a long channel. For short channels, tunneling and hopping currents need to be taken into account using the appropriate quantum formalism, see [24]. To obtain an expression for IDS in subthreshold, we approximate this carrier flow with driftdiffusion transport in first order. We also adopt the gradualchannel and depletion approximations for obtaining the surface electric field from the 1-D MOS Poisson equation.\nThe mobile sheet charge density is then given by Qi \u2248 \u2212(m\u2212 1) \u00b7 Cox \u222b \u03c8s 0 n(\u03c8) NA \u00b7 d\u03c8 (8)\nwhere Cox is the gate-oxide capacitance, \u03c8s is the surface potential, and NA the doping concentration [25]. Recall that the Fermi-Dirac integral with exponential-tail DOS is\nn = \u222b Ec \u2212\u221e DOSE ( E \u2212 Ec kBTc ) \u00b7 fD(E) \u00b7 dE, (9)\nwhere fD(E) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and Ec is now the conduction-band edge at which the tail transitions into the band. This integral is exactly expressible as a Gauss hypergeometric (GH) function. Using mathematical formulas from Gradshteyn and Ryzhik for this special function [26], it is possible to derive a Boltzmann-like relation, which is valid in subthreshold. It features a sum of two exponentials: [27]\nn(\u03c8) = Nc \u00b7Ac \u00b7 exp ( \u03c8 \u2212 \u03a6F,n \u2212 0.5 \u00b7 Eg\nUT\n) (10)\n+ Nc \u00b7Bc \u00b7 exp ( \u03c8 \u2212 \u03a6F,n \u2212 0.5 \u00b7 Eg\nUT,c\n) ,\nwhere Nc is an effective DOS, UT \u225c kBT/q is the thermal voltage, UT,c \u225c kBTc/q is the \u201cband-tail thermal voltage\u201d, q \u00b7\u03c8 = Eoc \u2212Ec is the electrostatic potential, q \u00b7\u03a6F,n = Eoc \u2212 EF,n \u2212 0.5 \u00b7 Eg is the quasi-Fermi potential of the electrons, EF is the Fermi level, and Eoc is the reference energy. The temperature-dependent coefficients in (10) are given by{\nAc = \u03b8/(\u03b8 \u2212 1), Bc = \u03c0\u03b8/ sin(\u03c0\u03b8),\n(11)\nwhere \u03b8 \u225c T/Tc is the operating temperature normalized to the critical temperature. The coefficients Ac and Bc will be important to obtain a well-behaved expression for SS over T . The discontinuities of Ac and Bc at integer values of \u03b8 (multiples of Tc) do not necessarily point to a limitation\nin the derivation or in the physical assumptions. They can arise from the Gamma functions which are encountered in the mathematics of the Fermi-Dirac integrals with an exponential DOS [27]. The expression for IDS is further derived in the Appendix, see (22)-(28). Differentiating (28) to VGS and plugging the result back into the definition of SS (7), gives\nSS = m \u00b7 ( kBT\nq\n) \u00b7 ln(10) \u00b7 \u03b2c, (12)\nwhere \u03b2c = 1 + f \u00b7 \u03b7/\u03b82\n1 + f \u00b7 \u03b7/\u03b8 , (13)\nis a new multiplicative factor that contains the influence of the band tail. Recall that \u03b8 = T/Tc is the normalized temperature, and we have also defined the following functions\nf = Bc Ac = \u03c0 \u00b7 (\u03b8 \u2212 1) sin(\u03c0\u03b8) , (14)\n\u03b7 = r \u00b7 e \u2212VGT m\u00b7UT \u00b7(1\u2212\u03b8) , (15)\nand r = ( 1\u2212 e \u2212VDS UT,c ) / ( 1\u2212 e \u2212VDS UT ) . (16)\nFigs. 3(a)-(c) plot f(\u03b8), \u03b2c(\u03b8, \u03b7), and SS versus \u03b8, respectively. At \u03b8 = 2, one of the infinite discontinuities appears, which arise at multiples of \u03b8 due to the sin-function in the denominator of f(\u03b8). We aim to overcome these discontinuities noting that \u03b7 goes fast to zero above Tc, therefore f(\u03b8) is only important at low temperatures in the expression of \u03b2c. The low-temperature asymptote [ sin(\u03c0\u03b8) \u2248 \u03c0\u03b8 ] gives f(\u03b8) \u2248 \u22121/\u03b8, and therefore \u03b2c simplifies to\n\u03b2c \u2248 1\u2212 \u03b7/\u03b83\n1\u2212 \u03b7/\u03b82 , (17)\nwhich does no longer give rise to infinite discontinuities at multiples of \u03b8 as shown with the dashed blue line in Fig.3(b). Fig.3(b) also shows that \u03b2c has the elusive 1/\u03b8 = Tc/T asymptote at low temperatures that we have been searching for [green solid line]. This 1/T dependence has been postulated in early hypotheses but was not derived there [17], [18]. It emerges from the IDS factor instead of the slope factor. If the standard Boltzmann limit of SS, without \u03b2c, is still used at cryogenic temperatures, an apparent 1/T -dependence in m will be extracted from the experimental SS data [20]. This can lead to unrealistic predictions of the interface-state density (m \u221d Nit) [28], and thus \u03b2c (or an equivalent expression) is best included. Parallels can be drawn between (12) and the empirical models which insert an effective slope-factor [17], [18] or an effective temperature [16] inside the Boltzmann limit, by defining meff = m \u00b7 \u03b2c or Teff = T \u00b7 \u03b2c in (12).\nNote that Ac and Bc in (10) were important to obtain a wellbehaved transition around Tc. Assuming [Ac = Bc = 1 and thus f(\u03b8) = 1], which corresponds to a standard Boltzmann relation for the band carriers, plus assuming a step-like Fermi function in the band tail, gives rise to an unphysical SS(T ) behavior dropping below Boltzmann\u2019s thermal limit around \u03b8 = 1, as shown with the black solid line in Fig. 3(c)."

This allows to extract the band-tail decay (Wt,c = kBTc) from transport measurements at cryogenic temperatures. Fig. 4(b) shows the impact of a larger slope factor due to bad gate control. The influence of m on SS is more pronounced in the high-T limit.\nFig. 4(c) shows a smoother transition of SS around Tc for smaller |VGT | (VG closer to VT and EF closer to the band edge scanning a greater portion of the band tail). Thus VGT gives a (partial) physical explanation for the smoothing parameters \u03b1 and D0 introduced in the empirical closedform expressions [(7), [10]] and [(9), [16]], respectively.

Using interpolation, the VG(T ) and VT (T ) data points are obtained from the experimental data at these two IDS values. Their difference VGT is then plotted in Fig. 5(b) [markers]. We observe that VGT has an approximately linear trend vs. temperature. A first-order model can be obtained for the VGT - dependence in the model by writing two expressions for IDS in the high-temperature limit (T > Tc) [first term in (28)]:\nI (V ccT ) DS = K \u00b7 U 2 T \u00b7 ( 1\u2212 e \u2212VDS UT ) (18)\nI (SS,extract) DS = K \u00b7 U 2 T \u00b7 e\nVGT mUT ( 1\u2212 e \u2212VDS UT ) (19)\nDividing both expressions, we obtain\nVGT = VGT0 \u2212m \u00b7 UT \u00b7 ln\n( I VT,cc DS\nISS,extractDS\n) (20)\nwhere the added VGT0 is the linearly extrapolated VGT at \u2248 0K.

The temperature trend of SS is extracted at IDS = 5\u00d710\u22129 A and shown in Fig. 5(d). The model is then fitted to the data according to the following procedure. First, the linear VGT model is fit to the experimental data in Fig. 5(b), using m, VGT0, and the two known current values. The slope factor m is then further adjusted by looking at the high-temperature slope of SS(T ) in Fig. 5(d). Finally, Tc (or Tv for pMOS) is determined from the low-temperature plateau of SS(T )."

Exponential band tails can arise from Gaussian-distributed potential well depths in the channel if their binding energies are taken into account. The obtained SS model showed that the Boltzmann thermal limit becomes multiplied with a new factor that depends on temperature and voltage. In the lowtemperature limit, this new factor revealed the long-sought 1/T -dependence, which has often been postulated in previous literature. We started from a more general set of Boltzmann relations which was essential to arrive at a well-behaved transition around Tc. The gate-voltage dependence could partly explain the smoother roll-off around the transition temperature. The drain voltage dependence showed little impact. In the future, band-tail extraction can become a powerful tool to gauge interface quality in MOS structures for cryogenic computing.\nAPPENDIX Similarly, for the hole density, we have\np = Nv \u00b7Av \u00b7 exp ( \u2212\u03c8 +\u03a6F,p \u2212 0.5 \u00b7 Eg\nUT\n) (22)\n+ Nv \u00b7Bv \u00b7 exp ( \u2212\u03c8 +\u03a6F,p \u2212 0.5 \u00b7 Eg\nUT,v\n) ,\nwhere A and B remain the same as in (11), except that \u03b8 = T/Tv , with kBTv the extension of the valence-band tail.\nSince the valence-band tail will have little to no influence on the SS for an nMOSFET, we make a symmetric bandtail approximation (Tc \u2248 Tv; Nc \u2248 Nv) and assume that Av = Bv = 1. Furthermore, the effects of dopant freezeout and dopant ionization can be ignored in computing the SS. Therefore the charge-neutrality in the p-type bulk of the MOSFET (\u03c8 = 0) is simply p \u2248 NA, which yields two useful formulas at low and high temperatures, respectively:\nexp ( \u22120.5 \u00b7 Eg UT,c ) = NA Nc \u00b7 exp ( \u2212\u03a6F UT,c ) , (23)\nexp\n( \u22120.5 \u00b7 Eg\nUT\n) = NA Nc \u00b7 exp ( \u2212\u03a6F UT ) .

Inserting (23) and (24) into (10), we obtain the following expression\nn(\u03c8)\nNA = Ac \u00b7 exp\n( \u03c8 \u2212 2\u03a6F \u2212 V\nUT\n) (25)\n+ Bc \u00b7 exp ( \u03c8 \u2212 2\u03a6F \u2212 V\nUT,c\n) .\nCombining (25) with (8), integrating, and applying the subthreshold relation, VGS = m\u00b7\u03c8s, and the threshold-voltage definition, VT \u225c m \u00b7 2\u03a6F , we obtain the sheet-charge density,\n\u2212Qi = (m\u2212 1) \u00b7 Cox \u00b7 UT \u00b7Ac \u00b7 e VGT \u2212mV m\u00b7UT (26)\n+ (m\u2212 1) \u00b7 Cox \u00b7 UT,c \u00b7Bc \u00b7 e VGT \u2212mV m\u00b7UT,c ,\nwhere VGT = VGS\u2212VT < 0 in subthreshold. The exponential with the largest denominator (m \u00b7 UT or m \u00b7 UT,c) will\ndominate. At high T (UT \u226b UT,c or \u03b8 \u226b 1), this is the first exponential, and Ac \u2192 1, which recovers the standard Qi at room temperature [25]. At low T (UT \u226a UT,c or \u03b8 \u226a 1), the second exponential dominates, and Bc \u2192 1 [ sin(x) \u2248 x for small x ]. The drift-diffusion current in the MOSFET is [25]\nIDS = \u00b5 \u00b7 W\nL \u222b VDS 0 \u2212Qi(V ) \u00b7 dV, (27)\nwhere \u00b5 is the channel mobility, W and L the width and length of the transistor, and VDS the drain-to-source voltage. Integrating (27) with Qi from (26), we find a voltage- and T -dependent expression for the subthreshold current:\nIDS = K \u00b7 U2T \u00b7Ac \u00b7 e VGT m\u00b7UT ( 1\u2212 e \u2212VDS UT ) (28)\n+ K \u00b7 U2T,c \u00b7Bc \u00b7 e VGT m\u00b7UT,c ( 1\u2212 e \u2212VDS UT,c ) ,\nwhere K = \u00b5 \u00b7 WL \u00b7 (m\u2212 1) \u00b7 Cox."
