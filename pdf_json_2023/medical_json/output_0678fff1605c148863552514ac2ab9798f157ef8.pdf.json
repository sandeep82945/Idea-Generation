It is easy to record changes in body weight, but it is frequently difficult to interpret the changes in patients with acute HF (AHF), because the body weight change may be influenced by the congestive status of each patient which is often unstable in AHF. In this context, there is a paucity of data on the incidence and effect of weight loss in patients with AHF.\nWhen we follow the patients with AHF, we usually check the body weight at a follow-up\nvisit and compare it to that at discharge. Thus, we investigated the incidence of weight loss after discharge and the association between weight loss and clinical outcomes in patients discharged for AHF using data from a large Japanese registry."

In parallel with the main KCHF study, we designed a prospective, longitudinal study enrolling a subgroup of patients from the KCHF study in which the selected patients were to have a 6-month visit with an allowance of 1-month (Fig 1A) [5]. At the follow-up visit, we collected the data for physical findings, echocardiography, laboratory data and medications at 6-month after enrollment. Time zero for the clinical follow-up in the present study was the day of the 6-month follow-up visit, and considered it as the index day. Clinical follow-up was censored at 210 days after the 6-month visit (Fig 1B). Exclusion criteria for the prospective longitudinal follow-up study were as follows: no written informed consent (N = 238), patient with an age of <20 years (N = 1), fever or infectious diseases at admission (N = 297), acute coronary syndrome at admission (N = 157), end-stage renal failure (N = 218), severe comorbidity limiting the life expectancy within one year assessed by attending physicians at each participating center, such as end-stage cancer, severe cognitive dysfunction, and end-stage liver dysfunction (N = 112), ineligible for follow up (unable to visit each participating hospital for various reasons) (N = 1516). After excluding 271 patients who died during index hospitalization and 2539 patients who did not meet the pre-specified criteria of follow-up, 1246 patients were enrolled in the prospective longitudinal follow-up study. We excluded 23 patients who died within 6 months after initial hospitalization, 14 patients with lost to follow-up during 6 months after enrollment, 250 patients without data for 6-month visit, 273 patients with missing body weight data at discharge and/or at 6-month visit (Fig 1A and S1 Table).

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was developed to estimate the adjusted risk of weight loss relative to no weight loss for the primary outcome measure. To account for the competing risk of allcause death, the risk of HF hospitalization was described using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model. We included the following 11 clinically relevant risk-adjusting variables into the model: age\ufffd80 years, sex, malignancy, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF: left\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287637 June 23, 2023 4 / 13\nventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]<40%), body mass index (BMI) <20 kg/m2 at 6-month visit, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 6-month visit, albumin<3.0 g/dL at 6-month visit, anemia at 6-month visit and medications at 6-month visit (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] or angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs], \u03b2-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [MRAs]). We selected these variables according to their clinical relevance to the clinical outcomes and based on the previous studies [8,9]. The continuous variables were dichotomized by the clinically meaningful reference values or median values. We also evaluated the interactions between the subgroup factors such as age, etiology of HF, LVEF, BMI, albumin, anemia and GNRI at 6-month visit and the effects of weight loss relative to no weight loss on all-cause death after 6-month visit. The results were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were conducted by 2 physicians (Y.S. and T.K.) and a statistician (T.M.) using JMP Pro 15 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and EZR [10].

Despite the differences in patients\u2019 backgrounds, a substantial population (from 10% to 20%) of patients with AHF may have\ufffd5% weight loss during 6-month follow-up and they had a higher risk for adverse events. After adjusting confounders including the BMI, we showed that the weight loss after discharge was associated with increased risk for all-cause death after 6-month visit. It is not clear why the KM curves for all-cause mortality at 30 days differ. There are two suggested reasons for this: 1) the number of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287637.g002\npatients enrolled in this study is relatively small and the KM curves for the two cohorts are not smoothed; 2) it is possible that some of the patients who lost weight after discharge may have further improved congestion, making it difficult for them to have events immediately after the starting point of 6 months after discharge. Regarding HF hospitalization, we used the FineGray subdistribution hazard model to deal with the competing risk of all-cause death and showed that the weight loss after discharge was not associated with HF hospitalization. It is possible that some of the patients who had weight loss after discharge may have had further improvement in congestion, which may have influenced the results.\nCharacteristics in patients with body weight loss in AHF\nIn our study, patients with weight loss were more likely to have HFrEF, less often received ACEI/ARB, and had higher brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and lower albumin. In GISSI-HF, lower LVEF was associated with\ufffd5% weight loss within 1 year in patients with CHF [6]. Effective treatment of weight loss including cardiac cachexia has not been reported yet, although several studies targeting weight loss in various diseases including HF are ongoing [3,4]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that ACEIs and beta-blockers promote weight gain with the prevention of cardiac cachexia [1,13]. However, there was no difference in the prescription rate of beta-blockers between the 2 groups in the present analysis. The predictors of weight loss were higher BNP and N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) levels at baseline in patients with CHF [6,11,14]. In our study, no difference was observed in NT-proBNP levels at follow-up visit due to the small number of patients with data and large variability, although the increased NT-proBNP concentrations were associated with decreased abdominal fat mass in cardiac cachexia [15,16]. Patients with HF are likely to have reduced appetite and food intake [17]. Reduced food intake and decreased physical activity often causes cardiac cachexia [18]. Low serum albumin is one of the components in diagnostic criteria for cachexia [19]. The increase of GNRI was less in the weight loss group. These data suggest the importance of nutrition management and maintenance of activity during the follow-up for patients with AHF. In addition, there was a trend that patients with low BMI, low albumin levels, or low GNRI at 6-month visit were likely to have more risk when compared to those without, although there was no significant interaction between the effect of weight loss relative to no weight loss on the primary outcome measure and the subgroup factors.\nFurther research would be warranted to investigate the association between weight loss\nafter discharge and prognosis. Additional information would be needed to develop the strategies for preventing weight loss in patients with HF."

Third, patients with acute coronary syndrome and end-stage renal failure were excluded and it may decrease the generalizability of the study due to the selection bias. Fourth, weight loss in this study was assessed at 6-month after discharge, but the optimal time interval for evaluating weight loss remained unclear. Sixth, the lack of physical training is a well-known determinant of both weight loss and poor outcome in HF patients [20], but we have no data about undergoing cardiac rehabilitation or training programs after the index hospitalization.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287637 June 23, 2023 9 / 13"
