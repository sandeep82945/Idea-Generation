Medical students, who are more vulnerable to experiencing psychological distress than the general and peer population, had to combat an additional specific set of challenges connected with their studies and professional future\u2014e.g., helping in medical facilities [1, 2] which posed a risk of infection and transmitting the virus to loved ones. A major challenge was also halting clinical training [2] which is crucial for an effective medical education, and moving to e-learning as the leading form of medical education during the pandemic [3, 4]. Besides, the closing of universities and public libraries may have forced some students into an inadequate learning environment [5].\nThe pandemic extended the role of online learning in medical education. It was reported\nthat prolonged exposure to a computer or other device was associated with burnout, increased levels of stress, and the occurrence of stress-related mental and physical symptoms, which has an impact on an individual\u2019s quality of life and daily activities. Furthermore, it can be related to the development of mental health problems in students including moderate-to-severe depression [6]. Universities have been forced to strictly limit students\u2019 clinical practice and work placements due to the pandemic. Extra-curricular activities like attending conferences and conducting one\u2019s own research were also constricted which may have resulted in worries about career development [7]. These new difficult circumstances tested medical students\u2019 perseverance, stress management, and coping abilities. However, besides all the inadequacies associated with online education, it must be indicated that in these exceptional circumstances, it allowed communication with relatives and friends and contact with the academic community, enabling learning and teaching.\nThe first case of COVID-19 in Poland was confirmed on the 4th of March 2020. Restrictions\nwere implemented by virtue of the statute signed by the President of Poland on the 7th of March 2020. All mass events were canceled. Schools and universities were closed, and online learning was recommended. Crossing borders was restricted, with obligatory quarantine for every in-coming person. In the following days, parties and private meetings were forbidden. It was strongly recommended by the government to stay at home and leave only when essential. There was also a limited number of people allowed to stay in closed spaces like shops or means of public transportation. Walking in parks, woods, or on beaches or boulevards was also forbidden. Hairdressers, beauty salons, rehabilitation centers, and all shops except for grocery\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261652 January 24, 2022 2 / 16\nhave blinded the headings of some columns since we cannot share publicly questions of these surveys.

In April 2020, the cabinet council instituted regulations that obligated everyone to cover their mouth and nose in public spaces.\nIt may be hypothesized, that these extraordinary actions such as social distancing and clos-\ning schools, offices, and entertainment venues might have taken a toll especially on those more susceptible to stress and less resilient individuals.\nResilience is defined as the process of, capacity for, or outcome of successful adaptation\ndespite challenging or threatening circumstances [8], hence an ability for flexible adaptation to challenges [9]. It has an influence on other terms pertaining to an individual\u2019s or a group\u2019s mental state\u2014well-being and burnout [10, 11]. Well-being is successful and fulfilling performance in the psychological and physical domains of life [12, 13]. It is a state in which a person is aware of their own abilities, can cope with stress, and can work efficiently. The World Health Organization considers well-being to be an integral part of health [14]. Burnout is a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and poor satisfaction caused by occupation-related stressors [15]. Our study assesses resilience, well-being, and burnout among medical students in the COVID-19 era due to the new challenges brought by the pandemic. Several compounding factors like mental health problems, use of stimulants, medical education in the COVID-19 era, the level of mistrust towards healthcare professionals, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in respondents, their families, and friends, and volunteer or paid work in COVID-19 units were taken into account."

            "text": "A web-based survey hosted on the Survey Monkey application was distributed via various student Facebook groups and Instagram profiles (known as studygrams) assembling Polish medical students. The survey was sent to student council presidents of Polish medical schools to share with all the medical students from their universities, and to Polish students acting as influencers and promoting health and medical knowledge through their Instagram and Facebook profiles. All Facebook groups were open for medical students from the particular university, and Instagram profiles\u2014for subscribers to the profile. The survey was conducted from the 5th January 2021 to the 6th February 2021 and posted once on all of the above-mentioned groups. The approximate time to complete the survey was expected to be 10\u201315 minutes. Due to the method of data collection (no computer IP numbers were collected) we could not prevent the same person filling out the questionnaire more than once.\nThe first page of the survey contained the informed consent. Expressing consent enabled\nproceeding to the next questions in the survey.\nThe study survey consisted of three validated questionnaires\u2014Resilience Scale-14, Medical Students Well-Being Index, and Maslach Burnout Inventory\u2014General Survey for Students, as well as self-created questions. All validated questionnaires were used in accordance with the license agreements.\nThe Resilience Scale (RS-14) is a 14-item survey validated in the population of Polish young\nadults (age 19\u201327) [16]. RS-14 uses a Likert scale with seven possible responses for each item ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). All items are positively worded, and a higher score indicated greater resilience. RS-14 scores range from 14 to 98. The RS-14 score ranges indicate the level of resilience, as follows: very low resilience (14\u201356 points), low (57\u2013 64), on the low end (65\u201373), moderate (74\u201381), moderately high (82\u201390) and high (91\u201398 points). The RS-14 scores correlate significantly with measures of positive concepts (i.e., life satisfaction). Resilience was negatively related to indexes of perceived stress and the dimension of depression [8].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261652 January 24, 2022 3 / 16\nMedical Students Well-Being Index (MSWBI) is a validated tool in a medical student population and consists of 7 \u201cyes or no\u201d questions evaluating distress across a variety of dimensions including fatigue, depression, burnout, anxiety, stress, and mental as well as physical quality of life [17]. MSWBI scores range from 0 to 7, and 7 points indicate the greatest level of distress. The MSWBI was proven to be a useful tool in identifying students with severe distress, and the MSWBI scores correlate with quality of life, fatigue, recent suicidal ideation, burnout, and the likelihood of seriously considering dropping out of medical school [13].\nThe 16-item Maslach Burnout Inventory\u2014General Survey for Students (MBI-GS(S)) is a validated tool used to measure burnout among student populations. The MBI-GS(S) (Mind Garden Inc., Menlo Park, CA), designed for college and university students, is divided into three distinct domains: emotional exhaustion (EE)\u20145 items, cynicism (CY)\u20145 items, and academic efficacy (AE)\u20146 items [15, 18]. The respondents were asked to report the frequency of particular feelings associated with their studying, and each statement was assessed on a time scale (never\u20140 points, a few times a year\u20141 point, once a month or less\u20142 points, a few times a month\u20143 points, once a week\u20144 points, a few times a week\u20145 points, and every day \u20146 points). By adding points for items in particular dimensions, burnout was classified as low, moderate, and high in all three dimensions (see Table 4 for reference values). High scores for CY and EE and low scores for AE meant greater burnout (three-dimensional burnout). Twodimensional burnout has been described previously in the literature [19] and is defined as high cynicism and high emotional exhaustion. Since there was no Polish version of the MBI-GS(S) available, the authors of this study requested permission from Mind Garden Inc. to create a Polish translation. The translation was prepared, evaluated, and is now made available to all researchers via the Mind Garden platform (https://www.mindgarden.com/).\nThe questions in the self-created part of the survey aimed to assess:\n1. The psychological condition of the respondent\u2014diagnosis of psychological or psychiatric\ndisorders, psychological care or psychiatric treatment, use of psychiatric drugs, OTC drugs (especially tranquilizers), use of alcohol, cigarettes, and other stimulants, change in selfesteem during the pandemic;\n2. SARS-CoV-2 infections in respondents and/or their families as well as the clinical course of\nthe infection;\n3. COVID-19-related volunteer or paid work\u2014extracurricular volunteer or paid work in the\nCOVID-19 units as hospital orderlies, attitude and willingness to work after classes, or to volunteer during class hours, with COVID-19 patients instead of participating in online education, the level of fear connected with working or volunteering and the reasons behind it;\n4. Medical education during the pandemic\u2014the number of in-person classes, including prac-\ntical and clinical classes, participation in summer clinical clerkships, evaluation of the online education\u2014the preferred and most frequent form of online classes and the personal assessment of the impact of online education on practical skills, theoretical knowledge, and future work; the level of motivation, procrastination, and solitude during the pandemic;\n5. Student views on cases of social aversion and mistrust towards healthcare professionals dur-\ning the pandemic and their importance for the motivation to continue medical education.\nThe self-created part of the survey is provided as the (S1 File). The pilot study of the self-created part of the survey was performed on a group of 25 stu-\ndents of different years, and their remarks on the quality of the questions were applied in the final version of the survey.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261652 January 24, 2022 4 / 16\nThe demographic data collected as part of the survey included age, gender, year of study,\nand name of medical school.\nAll questions, except for informed consent, were answered voluntarily.

Additionally, we took burnout and well-being into account as reliable measures of general and education-related welfare. While medical students were already experiencing high levels of distress before the pandemic [20], these new challenges showed the priority of providing support and building resilience in this vulnerable population, with the aim being to have a workforce that will be able to combat the long-lasting consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and who can effectively face similar crises in the future. The strict limitations on students\u2019 clinical practice and work placements imposed due to the pandemic caused decreased motivation and concerns of inappropriate levels of knowledge as well as questioning their abilities to pass final examinations and work as doctors [21], something that was also reported in our study. Almost two-thirds of the respondents presented low levels of resilience, indicating a problem with their ability to maintain or regain mental health while experiencing adversity [22] such as a global pandemic. Low resilience was correlated with more severe burnout, poor well-being, reduced motivation, and higher usage of stimulants during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may support the conclusion that building resilience is one of the components of creating driven, invested, and content healthcare professionals. Interestingly, the lowest resilience was found among the 1st- and 6thyear medical students, which may indicate that programs for building resilience should be"

The need to prioritize healthy coping methods was reported in several other studies [23\u201325], and previous research has shown that medical students were eager to learn about healthy ways of coping with stress and to find out about tools that may help them with building resilience [26]. Jensen et al. identified many ways of building resilience in physicians\u2014maintaining an interest in their role, acceptance of personal limitations, setting limits, or group practice [27]. Zwack et al. reported that leisure-time activity to reduce stress, cultivation of relations with family and friends, self-organization, and spiritual practices were among the methods that helped physicians to maintain high resilience [28]. These coping strategies could also be adapted to the population of medical students\u2014courses in stress management and maintaining mental health, held by both professional psychologists as well as more experienced colleagues, could have a positive influence on building their resilience. Studies have pointed to self-efficacy, described as confidence in one\u2019s [own] abilities to successfully perform a particular behavior, influence events, and affect other lives, as a possible focus for building resilience in students [29\u201331].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261652.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261652 January 24, 2022 11 / 16\nDue to the combination of COVID-19 restrictions and online learning, researchers were\nforced to distribute questionnaires online, without direct contact with responders, which may have resulted in bias typical for online surveys. Sampling bias, defined as bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others, must, therefore, be considered in our population\u2014 students who were more active on the social media had higher sampling probability, and some characteristics of this group may influence the results. Besides, desirability bias, which reflects the human tendency to appear and behave desirably and avoid undesirable traits, could influence our data, especially with regard to questions on volunteer work or learning habits. Nevertheless, this kind of data collection enabled reaching out to many medical students from different universities; however, survey questions other than validated questionnaires were created by the authors who, being members of the academic community, might allow their own experiences to lead to author bias. Additionally, due to the scarcity of data on resilience, burnout, and well-being in the population of Polish medical students, our data only reflect the current situation, and we could not assess if there was any deterioration of the studied parameters. Nevertheless, some similar research projects were performed in Europe; a study from Cyprus, which also used the MBI-SS questionnaire, revealed that burnout prevalence did not differ significantly before and after the pandemic in the population as a whole.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261652.g004"

In the group of fourthyear medical students, burnout prevalence decreased, we also reported lowest burnout among fourth-year medical students in our study. Emotional exhaustion also decreased in this group, while cynicism increased in all groups [32]. Research on burnout and study satisfaction conducted in Croatia did not reveal the influence of the first lockdown and the switch to online learning on burnout in medical students, or their perception of study satisfaction [33]. Interestingly, a similar study from Kazakhstan showed that burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms decreased after switching to online learning. However, the prevalence of colleague-related burnout during online learning increased in that time [34]. Based on reports from other European countries that examined the level of mental health, cynicism, and burnout in medical students before and during the pandemic, it was concluded that digital learning carries significant risks. It has been found that not only does mental health deteriorate but the level of cynicism also increases. Emotional exhaustion has been found to increase especially in final year students who struggle with a lack of clinical experience just prior to joining qualified junior physicians [32]. In our study, the median MSWBI value was 5 points out of a maximum 7 (greatest distress). This entails less than average performance in psychological and physical domains of life mixed with a lack of awareness of students\u2019 own abilities, fatigue, and an inability to cope with stress. It has been reported that anxiety levels among medical students are substantially higher than in the general population [33]. Other research showed that medical students have a high prevalence of distress and depression, especially among 1st-year students, due to issues of adjusting to a new environment and increased workload [34]. In our study, we report the lowest resilience levels in 1stand 6th-year medical students. It may be hypothesized, therefore, that these subpopulations may suffer most from new environment adjustments (1st-year students) and increased workload combined with new challenges (6th-year students). It was reported that depression and depressive symptoms are common among physicians [35], and their suicide rates are higher than in the general population [36]. So, future doctors with poor well-being joining the workforce during and after the pandemic may have an elevated risk of mental health problems as well. It was confirmed that depression among medical students in Poland is common [37], and due to the lack of central regulations, psychological support is provided by medical schools individually. Those solutions focus on short-term, temporary therapy [38]. The majority of respondents (80.2%) reported feeling that social aversion and mistrust towards doctors increased during the pandemic, and many of them (43.3%) claimed that it may affect their enthusiasm about their future job. Although there is very little research about mistrust among patients in Poland fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists from other countries reported that many people endorse conspiracy theories about the origins of the pandemic [39], and some are hesitant to be vaccinated because of their distrust of political and medical institutions, \u201canti-establishment\u201d sentiments, and conspiratorial and paranoid beliefs [40, 41] and, because of the shortage of healthcare professionals [42\u201344], the need to care for COVID19 patients and prevent further spread of the virus, the \u201cnon-COVID\u201d patients are often left waiting in long queues for telehealth that may not be enough, especially for those with lower socioeconomic backgrounds, who can\u2019t afford easy access to the devices needed for telemedicine [45]. All these problems have also been present in Poland and may have contributed to the growth of medical mistrust among polish patients.\nThe conclusions from our study should encourage both faculty and student organizations\nto develop proper resilience-building strategies. Besides, there is a strong need to support students\u2019 mental health and to monitor students\u2019 well-being during the time of recovery from the pandemic. Today\u2019s students are the physicians of tomorrow and their ability to adapt to challenges is crucial for effective and efficient patient care in the future.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261652 January 24, 2022 13 / 16"
