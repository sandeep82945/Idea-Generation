    "abstractText": "Cancer cells require lipids to fulfill energetic, proliferative, and signaling requirements. Even though these cells can take up exogenous fatty acids, the majority exhibit a dependency on de novo fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is the rate-limiting enzyme in this process. Expression and activity of FASN is elevated in multiple cancers, where it correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis. These observations have sparked interest in developing methods of detecting FASN expression in vivo. One promising approach is the imaging of radiolabeled molecular probes targeting FASN by positron emission tomography (PET). However, although [11C]acetate uptake by prostate cancer cells correlates with FASN expression, no FASN-specific PET probes currently exist. Our aim was to synthesize and evaluate a series of small molecule triazolones based on GSK2194069, an FASN inhibitor with IC50 = 7.7 \u00b1 4.1 nM, for PET imaging of FASN expression. These triazolones were labeled with carbon-11 in good yield and excellent radiochemical purity, and binding to FASN-positive LNCaP cells was significantly higher than FASN-negative PC3 cells. Despite these promising characteristics, however, these molecules exhibited poor in vivo pharmacokinetics and were predominantly retained in lymph nodes and the hepatobiliary system. Future studies will seek to identify structural modifications that improve tumor targeting while maintaining the excretion profile of these first-generation 11C-methyltriazolones.",

            "text": "Increased lipogenesis is a phenotypic hallmark of many cancer cells [1,2]. Fatty acids support a number of essential processes in cancer, including proliferation, energy, oncogenic signaling pathways, and resistance to therapy [1,3]. The fatty acid pool in cancer cells is fed by both de novo fatty acid synthesis and the uptake of exogenous fatty acids [4]. However, the majority of cancer cells overexpress lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase (E.C. 2.3.1.85; FASN) and exhibit a dependency on de novo fatty acid synthesis [5]. FASN\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1552. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27051552 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1552 2 of 16\nsynthesizes palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, using NADPH as a reducing equivalent [2], and is the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis [6]. The products of de novo fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells are predominantly esterified to phospholipid aggregates that participate in signal transduction, intracellular trafficking, and cell migration [7]. FASN is also proposed to support post-translational modification and provide palmitate as a source of fuel [8]. FASN expression is regulated by the PI3K/Akt axis [9], which is frequently dysregulated in cancer [10]. Consequently, expression and activity of FASN is elevated in multiple cancers [11\u201315], where it correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis [13,16,17]. In contrast to cancerous cells, FASN expression in normal tissue is typically low [5]. This facilitates a therapeutic strategy based on inhibition of FASN activity. FASN exists as a homodimer comprised of identical subunits of seven domains, many of which have been targeted by pharmacological inhibitors [2,18]. Early studies using broader spectrum inhibitors targeting specific domains of FASN demonstrated decreased viability of cancer cells and restrained tumor growth in xenograft models as a consequence of FASN inhibition [19\u201326] but these compounds were limited by poor solubility, poor bioavailability, and off-target toxicity [2,18,27]. More recently, multiple classes of high affinity small molecule inhibitors have been developed and advanced into preclinical [28\u201332] and clinical evaluation [33,34]. In spite of the prevalence of small molecule FASN inhibitor platforms, no FASNspecific agent exists for in vivo imaging of FASN expression by positron emission tomography (PET) [34]. Our aims were to develop a family of 11C-labeled FASN inhibitors based on high affinity triazolone-containing compounds related to GSK2194069 [35,36] and to evaluate these compounds in prostate cell lines and xenograft models characterized by high and low FASN expression. We report the synthesis of three [11C]methyltriazolones that are rapidly taken up by lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cells in an FASN-specific manner, but are limited in their imaging utility by poor in vivo pharmacokinetics. These compounds may pave the way for radiolabeled FASN inhibitors with better pharmacokinetics in the future."

This approach was based on the observation that N-methylation of the triazolone moiety of GSK2194069 (1), a commerciallyavailable, high affinity FASN ligand, does not substantially decrease FASN affinity (10 nM vs. 20 nM) [35]. We selected two fluorine-containing triazolones (2 and 3) from a library of previously published library of GSK2194069 analogues [35] for this purpose since they could be labeled with fluorine-18 as an alternative to carbon-11 should our initial studies prove successful. Fluorine-18 has superior physical properties (e.g., higher positron branching, lower positron Emax) for PET imaging than carbon-11, but the chemistry of fluoride incorporation on electron-rich aromatic rings is challenging.

In Vitro Cell Binding The activity of the probes was determined against LNCaP cells, which highly express FASN (Figure S4), and PC3 prostate cancer cells, which express FASN at much lower levels and served as our negative controls. Each of the compounds exhibited higher binding to LNCaP cells than to PC3 cells after the harvested counts were normalized to protein content. Binding was characterized by a rapid initial rate of uptake, followed by a period of equilibrium (Figure 5). Peak cell binding was reached after 10\u201315 min and was two-fold higher in LNCaP cells. Efflux of radioactivity was negligible up to 50 min after addition of activity. Peak binding of [11C]5 and [11C]6 to LNCaP cells was comparable (4.23 \u00b1 0.14 vs. 5.06 \u00b1 0.18% added activity), while peak binding of [11C]4 was slightly lower (2.37 \u00b1 0.21% added activity).

Discussion In contrast to many cancers, prostate cancer exhibits highly variable uptake of [18F]FDG [38]. This variability likely reflects the biological and clinical heterogeneity of disease [39]. [18F]FDG uptake has prognostic value, particularly in metastatic prostate cancer [40\u201342], but uptake in androgen-sensitive disease is generally low [43]. [11C]Choline and [18F]fluorocholine exploit upregulation of choline metabolism in prostate cancer, which leads to increased phosphatidylcholine levels and turnover [44,45]. Similarly to [18F]FDG PET, [11C]choline and [18F]fluorocholine PET suffer from diminished sensitivity in primary cancer, but may be of greater value in detecting recurrent disease [46]. Sensitive detection of prostate cancer by metabolic imaging therefore requires other metabolic pathways to be considered. Lipid metabolism is upregulated even at early stages of prostate cancer [47], rendering this pathway an attractive target for diagnostic and prognostic imaging. FASN catalyzes the de novo synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and is an important regulator of lipid\nFigure 7. axi u i t it j CT images of 11C-lab led triaz lones in male inbred athymic nu/nu mice bearing L aP xenografts (n 4 per co poun ). ice ere imaged in groups of 4, with 2 representative examples shown per compound.

Sensitive detec ion of prostate cancer by me abolic imaging ther fore requires other metabolic pathways to be considered. Lipid metabolism is upregulated even at early stages of prostate cancer [47], rendering this pathway an attractive targ t for diagnostic and prognostic imaging. FASN catalyzes the de novo synthesis of long-chain fatty aci s and is an i portant regulator of lipid metabolism [48]. In spite of the emerging importance of FASN as a marker of\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1552 7 of 16\ntumor aggressiveness [11], a possible pharmacological target [31,32], and a prognostic indicator [11,49], there are no probes for direct in vivo PET imaging of FASN expression. [11C]Acetate is proposed to be a probe for FASN on the basis that its uptake correlates with FASN expression in multiple prostate cancer cell lines [50,51]. More recent studies in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines do not find similar correlation [52]. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that [11C]acetate uptake is only an indirect measure of lipid synthesis. [11C]Acetate is thought to be taken up by monocarboxylate transporters [53]. In the cell, [11C]acetate may be oxidized in mitochondria, resulting in the liberation of [11C]CO2 [54], or act as a substrate for Acetyl-CoA synthetase [55]. As [11C]CO2 rapidly effluxes from cells and tissue, retention of radioactivity in tumors is likely to be due to formation of acetyl-CoA [54]. However, acetyl-CoA is not only a building block for fatty acid synthesis, but for sterols, ketone bodies, and the TCA cycle as well [56]. In this light, increased uptake of [11C]acetate in tumors may indicate upregulation of alternative mechanisms to glycolysis for preserving the pool of acetyl-CoA [57]. [18F]Fluoroacetate is a potential analogue of [11C]acetate on the basis of structural similarity [58], but in vivo defluorination is significant in preclinical models [58,59], and [18F]fluoroacetate does not appear to be a functional analogue of [11C]acetate [60]. 2-[18F]Fluoropropionic acid is another short chain fatty acid analogue that shows good uptake and retention in prostate cancer [60] and liver cancer xenografts [61,62]. However, to date, the significance of 2-[18F]fluoropropionic acid tumor uptake remains poorly understood. Uptake of 2-[18F]fluoropropionic acid appears to correlate with FASN expression [62], but the precise biochemical pathways and cellular entities targeted by this tracer have yet to be elucidated. In contrast to prior approaches to imaging FASN, we chose small molecule inhibitors of FASN as parent structures for radiotracer development. We reasoned that these radiotracers would be specific for FASN expression. Our compound library was based on one of the most potent and selective inhibitors of FASN reported to date. GSK2194069 targets the \u03b2ketoacyl reductase domain of human FASN and inhibits the enzyme with IC50 < 10 nM [36]. Methylation of the triazolone moiety of GSK2194069 (4; Figure 1) retains its potency, with IC50 = 20 nM [35]. Similarly, introduction of a fluorine atom at the 2-position of the phenyl ring, results in compounds with a potency as high as 3 nM depending on the selection of (hetero)aromatic substituent at the 4-position of the phenyl ring. Our structural modifications, which consisted of the addition of a fluorine atom to 4 (5; Figure 1), and substitution of a 4-chlorophenyl moiety for the benzofuran moiety of 5 (6; Figure 1), had variable effects on potency. Analogue 5 retained the potency of GSK2194069 in LNCaP cells, but the potency of 6 was substantially compromised. Our quantification of FASN expression by Western blot confirms high expression in LNCaP cells and much lower expression in PC3 cells (Figure S4), in agreement with literature reports [50]. In this light, the greater binding seen in LNCaP cells is consistent with FASN targeting. The difference in binding between the two cell lines is approximately two-fold but binding to both cell lines is relatively low when expressed as a percentage of the added dose. It is possible that the difference would be accentuated at higher levels of cell binding. When LNCaP cells were cultured for longer than 48 h, we achieved greater total cell binding (17% vs. 7% added activity of [11C]5 at peak binding; Figure S6), but cells no longer grew as a monolayer. Consequently, we adjusted our assay conditions to increase reproducibility at the expense of total cell binding. Notwithstanding our promising findings in vitro, the tumor targeting of [11C]4, [11C]5, and [11C]6 in vivo was poor. Given that we did not observe a loss in FASN expression in the tumors relative to the parent cell line (Figure S4), we investigated alternative explanations. Alkylation of triazolones on the oxygen atom under basic conditions has been reported [63]. In the absence of reference standards for O-methylation, we could not be certain that our analytical method could distinguish between the N-[11C]methyl and O-[11C]methyl compounds. Therefore, we explored alternative radiolabeling strategies, including variation of base (NaOH, K2CO3, KOtBu), solvent (DMF, DMSO), reaction temperature (25 \u25e6C,\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1552 8 of 16\n80 \u25e6C), and alkylating agent ([11C]CH3I, [11C]CH3OTf). Small differences in decay corrected radiochemical yield were evident, but the purified final products behaved identically in analytical assays and in vivo imaging studies. These findings led us to conclude that the poor tumor targeting is a consequence of poor pharmacokinetics. Our images indicated high retention of signal in the hepatobiliary pathway. We did not observe significant renal clearance, and consequently activity in the bladder was low. This contrasts with [18F]FDG, for which accumulation of activity in the bladder can obscure the primary tumor in the prostate gland. Our next generation FASN ligands will seek to retain the excretion profile of these first-generation compounds while improving the tumor targeting."

However, the probes demonstrate remarkably poor tumor uptake in vivo, with the majority of the activity retained in lymph nodes and the hepatobiliary system.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1552 13 of 16\nFuture studies should target structural modifications that improve the pharmacokinetics of these triazolone FASN inhibitors.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: online, Full experimental details, including Scheme S1: Synthesis of 4 from GSK2194069, and Scheme S2: Synthesis of non-radioactive standards 5 and 6 and their precursors 2 and 3; Figure S1: Radio (top) and UV (bottom) chromatograms of purified [11C]4; Figure S2: Radio (top) and UV (bottom) chromatograms of purified [11C]5; Figure S3: Radio (top) and UV (bottom) chromatograms of purified [11C]6; Figure S4.
