In this paper we discuss a method to remove the low-redshift contributions from CMB lensing mass maps by subtracting suitably scaled galaxy density maps, nulling the low redshift structure with a model-insensitive procedure that is similar to delensing. This results in a high-z-only mass map that can provide a probe of structure growth at uniquely high redshifts: if systematics can be controlled, we forecast that CMB-S4 lensing combined with a Rubin-LSST-like galaxy survey can probe the amplitude of structure at redshifts z > 3.75 (z > 5) to within 2.3% (3.3%). We then discuss other example applications of such high-z CMB lensing maps. In standard analyses of CMB lensing, assuming the wrong dark energy model (or wrong model parametrization) can lead to biases in neutrino mass constraints. In contrast, we show with forecasts that a high-z mass map constructed from CMB-S4 lensing and LSST galaxies can provide a nearly model-independent neutrino mass constraint, with only negligible sensitivity to the presence of nonstandard dark energy models, irrespective of their parametrization.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.123540\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAs the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons travel from the surface of last scattering to our telescopes, they are deflected by the gravitational influence of matter in our Universe (See Ref. [1] for a review). This lensing effect leads to a remapping, by typically a few arcminutes, of the observed CMB anisotropies on the sky. The lensing is sensitive to structures over a broad range of redshifts: most of the signal arises from between redshifts z \u00bc 0.5 and z \u00bc 5, although structures at higher redshifts also contribute to the signal; CMB lensing is hence a unique direct probe of the mass distribution at redshifts above z \u223c 4. However, our ability to constrain these still unexplored high-redshift contributions with CMB lensing alone is\nlimited by degeneracy with uncertainties in low-z structure growth and geometry (e.g., uncertainties in the dark energy model) as well as sample variance from low-redshift structures. To accurately and precisely probe high-redshift structure, and for several other applications, it can hence be useful to isolate only the high-redshift contributions to the CMB lensing data. To achieve this, in this paper we propose to clean the low redshift contributions from the lensing field by subtracting suitably-scaled correlated tracers such as galaxy density (or galaxy lensing) maps. Our method for nulling the low-z structure uses a process similar to delensing and similar to related approaches proposed by [2], with the difference that we do not account for noise in the process since our goal is to null the signal; this leads to more effective cleaning. (Related \u201cnulling\u201d ideas have also been presented in [3] and in the galaxy lensing literature [4\u20138]; our work focuses on galaxy density maps rather than intensity mapping lensing and does not assume perfect knowledge of the galaxy kernel to perform the cleaning.) We forecast how well such a high-z mass map and lensing spectrum can be measured with upcoming surveys; we also discuss why our methodology is only *jq247@cam.ac.uk Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Our method should be contrasted with cross-correlationbased approaches (e.g., [9] involving CMB lensing, cosmic shear, and galaxies, [10] involving CMB lensing and galaxies), where a joint likelihood is constructed for all auto- and cross-spectra of galaxy survey observables together with CMB lensing. While such approaches can also provide powerful and indeed optimal constraints on high-z structure, the constraints obtained generally involve also modeling the behavior of low-z structure (or at least the shape of low-z spectra if a free amplitude is marginalized over), whereas our approach explicitly nulls all low-z contributions at the cost of potentially increased errors. For example, if we wish to constrain neutrino masses using a standard cross- and autospectrum analysis despite uncertainties in the properties of dark energy, a model must be constructed for the low-redshift dark energy behavior and the constraints may be biased if the model is incorrect or incomplete; in contrast, our cleaning procedure reduces our sensitivity to such model biases insofar as they appear only in the redshifts that are removed. Our method also has the advantage that the high-z mass map, once constructed, can be easily used to perform a variety of high-z crosscorrelation and other analyses. This is analogous to the construction of foreground-cleaned ILC maps in CMB analyses [11\u201313], where using a cleaned map is often more convenient and robust than performing a full joint analysis of spectra at all frequencies.1\nAs an example application of our high-z lensing map (as previously mentioned), we will discuss in detail how one can use it to determine the unknown neutrino mass sum with reduced model dependence. The sum of the masses of the three neutrino species, P m\u03bd, is a key cosmological observable that can be determined via the suppression of the CMB lensing signal it produces. While a cosmological detection of the sum of neutrino masses is expected within the next decade with high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO) [14], SPT-3G [15], and CMB-S4 [16], these constraints are generally derived assuming a standard \u039bCDM cosmological model. Neutrino masses can also be determined in extended models with more complex, w0 \u2212 wa dark energy behavior, especially if galaxy survey data are included [9,17\u201319], albeit with somewhat degraded constraints; however, there is always some degree of modeldependence even in fixing an appropriate parametrization\nof dark energy models, given that the physics of dark energy (or modified gravity leading to similar phenomenology) is still not fully known. In contrast, we discuss in this paper how neutrino mass can be determined from the power spectrum of the aforementioned high-z lensing map without being biased by assuming standard (or fixed w0 \u2212 wa) dark energy or Einstein gravity; in this case, we need only to assume that at sufficiently high redshifts the effects of dark energy or modified gravity can be neglected, with the matter component dominating the energy density. In an Appendix B, we also discuss another application of partial delensing of a CMB lensing mass map to modify its effective redshift origin: reducing the error on crosscorrelation of CMB lensing with tracers restricted to only a certain narrow redshift range.2\nOur paper is structured as follows. We first present our lensing cleaning technique in Sec. II; in Sec. III we introduce the datasets used and the cleaning method applied in the context of amplitude of structure measurements. In Sec. IV, we explain, with forecasts of biases, why using a high-z-only lensing map is a promising approach for neutrino mass measurements with minimal dark energy model dependence. We conclude in Sec. V, outlining other potential applications of our cleaning method. Finally, Appendix A discusses how this cleaning method removes potential degeneracies in the determination of neutrino mass sum with effects induced by models of modified gravity and Appendix B explores the cleaning method in the context of improving the signal-to-noise ratio of lensing cross-correlations with galaxy fields. Throughout this paper, unless stated otherwise, we assume a \u039bCDM cosmology in a flat universe with fiducial parameters 100\u03b8MC \u00bc 1.0409, \u03a9bh2 \u00bc 0.0223, \u03a9ch2 \u00bc 0.1198, \u03c4 \u00bc 0.06, ns \u00bc 0.9645, As \u00bc 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22129, P m\u03bd \u00bc 0.06 eV, which give the values of the approximated acoustic angular scale at recombination, the physical baryon density, the physical cold matter density, the optical depth at recombination, the slope and amplitude of primordial scalar fluctuation at a pivot scale of 0.05 Mpc\u22121 and the neutrino mass sum, respectively."

Crosscorrelation tomography would be equivalent to constructing a likelihood for the entire dataset (including the low redshifts), whereas our approach is akin to simply throwing out the lowredshift bins and only modeling the remainder. Of course, in practice, projection, galaxy bias and other effects make the real situation slightly more involved.\n2In particular, motivated by the fact that the cleaning method introduced here is flexible and can isolate any redshift range when an appropriately correlated tracer is used, we explore briefly the prospects of using the cosmic infrared background (CIB) to delens the high redshift content of the lensing map. This is useful in the context of cross-correlation analyses [20\u201323]. The low redshift lensing map is expected to have a higher correlation with low redshift galaxy tracer and can lead to better constraints on cosmological parameters such as the linear bias b1 and low redshift amplitude of structure Alow.\n123540-2\nare generally restricted to z < 2 \u2212 3 due to challenges in observing well-characterized source galaxies in large numbers at high redshifts, and CMB lensing measurements are sensitive to a projection over a wide range of redshifts. However, introducing an external tracer field X\u0302 which is correlated with the CMB lensing field at low redshifts can allow us to remove the low-z portion of the CMB lensing field. The external mass tracer can either be a galaxy density field or a galaxy lensing map; although our methods are also applicable for galaxy lensing maps, we will consider the Rubin Observatory\u2014Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) [24] galaxy density maps as a representative example, assuming these can be approximated as linearly biased on the large scales of interest. How can we best remove the low-z portion of the CMB lensing field using external large-scale structure tracers? We note that a similar, but slightly different goal was studied in analyses of delensing using large-scale structure (LSS) tracers [25\u201327]. For B-mode delensing, the aim is to minimize the variance of the total field after a suitably filtered LSS tracer has been subtracted; whether this variance arises from lensing signal or noise is irrelevant to the computation. In contrast, our goal in obtaining a high-z-only lensing map is only to remove the low-z signal; the effect of the (we assume, well-understood) noise is irrelevant for this cleaning. However, the formalism that must be applied is very similar. To clean out the lowredshift signal, we can simply apply standard LSS delensing methodology, with the important difference that we set noise to zero in our filtering, since we care primarily about minimizing signal power rather than minimizing the total power including noise. Therefore, drawing on this simple modification of the previous delensing study [25], we can write down expressions that will give the best performance in removing the low-z portion of the CMB lensing field. If we have a single tracer field, the lensing cleaning proceeds as follows:\n\u03ba\u0302cleanL \u00bc \u03ba\u0302L \u2212 C\u03baXL CXXL X\u0302L; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere \u03ba\u0302L is the original CMB lensing convergence, and we adopt the convention that quantities with/without a hat represents quantities with/without noise, i.e. CX\u0302 Y\u0302L \u00bc CXYL \u00fe NXYL . This expression can be simply derived by minimizing the power spectrum of the linear combination \u03baL \u2212 c\u00f0L\u00deXL with respect to the cleaning coefficient c, assuming no noise in the maps. To see how the above accomplishes our goal in the removal of the low redshift portion of the lensing field let us decompose \u03ba \u00bc \u03balow \u00fe \u03bahigh into two uncorrelated low and high redshift pieces and assume, for illustration, that the galaxy field X is perfectly correlated with the low redshift part via a scaling function TL, XL \u00bc TL\u03balow;L.\nThe power spectrum of the cleaned lensing field, assuming noiseless \u03ba\u0302L and X\u0302L fields is given by\nC\u03baclean\u03bacleanL \u00bc C\u03bahigh\u03bahighL \u00fe C\u03balow\u03balowL \u2212 \u00f0TLC\u03balow\u03balowL \u00de2 T2LC \u03balow\u03balow L : \u00f02\u00de\nWe see that the last two terms of Eq. (2) cancel out, leading to the perfect subtraction of the low-z contribution of the lensing power spectrum. In practice, one does not expect the external tracer signal to be perfectly correlated with the CMB lensing signal arising from a certain low redshift range, but, especially if LSS tracers in several narrow redshift bins are available, a sufficiently high signal correlation can still be achieved, enabling the subtraction of much of the unwanted contribution to the lensing map. To maximize the subtraction of the low-z contribution to the CMB lensing kernel, we can combine different galaxy redshift bins to form an effective tracer map:\nX\u0302L \u00bc X i ci;Lg\u0302i;L; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere gi is the galaxy field of bin i. Following the methods in [25], but with the key difference that in the weights we only include signal power without (shot) noise, the coefficients ci which maximize the correlation coefficient between the signal part of X and the lensing field are given by\nci;L \u00bc X j \u00f0CovggL \u00de\u22121ij C\u03bagjL : \u00f04\u00de\nHere, CovggL;ij is the element of the covariance matrix between galaxies in bin i and bin j. (Note that if galaxy bins are combined using the weights of Eq. (4), this automatically implies that the ratio C\u03baXL =C XX L \u00bc 1.) Although all spectra used to construct the weights can, in principle, be obtained empirically (or at least with a fit of a model to data), for forecasting it is worth having fully analytical expressions for these spectra. The signal part of the galaxy spectra is then given explicitly in the Limber approximation [28] as CovggL;ij \u00bc Z dzH\u00f0z\u00de \u03c72\u00f0z\u00de W i\u00f0z\u00deWj\u00f0z\u00deP k \u00bc L\u00fe 1 2 \u03c7\u00f0z\u00de ; z : \u00f05\u00de\nHere H\u00f0z\u00de is the Hubble parameter, \u03c7\u00f0z\u00de is the comoving angular diameter distance to redshift z and P\u00f0k; z\u00de is the matter power spectrum with wave number k and redshift z.

            "text": "In the cleaning method above, an important step is the calculation of the weights ci in Eq. (4) used to maximize the correlation between the galaxy fields and lensing. When doing so, a model is assumed for the lensing cross spectra C\u03bagiL and auto spectra C gigi L of the galaxy fields. Although good measurements are achievable for the LSST survey, the true spectra, in particular, the true cross spectra C\u03bagiL between the galaxy fields and CMB lensing are not known precisely. The fact that we do not know the true galaxy cross- and auto spectra is a potential problem for two reasons: first, a misestimation of the weights can lead to a wrongly weighted galaxy field X\u0302 and hence give a residual C\u03baclean\u03bacleanL which is insufficiently (suboptimally) cleaned of low-z contributions; second, even if the weights are chosen optimally, our ignorance of the spectra and other properties of the galaxy tracer such as biases and redshift distributions implies that the interpretation of the cleaned lensing signal (including, e.g., its redshift distribution) is complex. We will begin by discussing the first challenge: to what extent does uncertainty in the weights lead to suboptimal cleaning performance? We will show that the effects of fluctuations in the lensing-galaxy cross spectra result only in sub-percent changes in the cleaned spectra, which are negligible for our example analysis. We do this by generating 1000 Gaussian realizations of the cross-correlation\nspectra C\u03bagiL curves, all of which are consistent with the forecast CMB-S4 and LSST errors (see the data section Sec. IVA), and use these to construct perturbed weights c\u0303i of Eq. (4). From these weights we obtain 1000 realizations of C\u03baclean\u03bacleanL which can then be compared with the fiducial one, C\u03baclean\u03baclean;fidL . The mean fractional difference between the cleaned power spectrum obtained from these perturbed weights and that of the fiducial cleaned spectra is shown in Fig. 1, where we have applied a broad multipole binning with edges at (40, 190, 340). We see that this difference is close to zero, with a standard deviation of 0.02 and 0.007 in the first and second bin respectively. These correspond to only 32% and 16% of the total uncertainties of the cleaned lensing spectra. Why are the deviations in the cleaned, high-redshift lensing spectra small? We will attempt to explain this by computing the effect that the uncertainty in the weights has in the final cleaned lensing spectrum. The perturbed cleaned lensing field is given by\n\u03ba\u0302cleanL \u00bc \u03ba\u0302L \u2212 X i c\u0303i\u00bdCabl \u00f01\u00fe \u03f5abl \u00de gi; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere ab stands for every possible auto- and crossspectrum of the LSS tracers and the CMB lensing field. The weights c\u0303i, which are a function of the true spectra Cabl , are chosen to minimize the power spectrum of the cleaned lensing field C\u03baclean\u03bacleanL . Since the optimal weights are the result of a minimization of the cleaned signal power, the cleaned power has no linear sensitivity to small changes in the weights; this implies that the cleaned power also has no linear sensitivity\n123540-4\nto small changes \u03f5ab\u00f0l\u00de in the fiducial spectra that are used to construct the weights. It follows that the signal in the cleaned lensing spectra only has a second-order dependence on small inaccuracies in the fiducial spectra:\nC\u03baclean\u03bacleanL \u00bc C\u03baclean\u03baclean;fidL \u00feO\u00f0\u00f0\u03f5ab\u00de2\u00de: \u00f010\u00de\nThis explains the result we saw in Fig. 1: even moderate uncertainties in the spectra used to weigh the tracers do not prevent the construction of a high-z mass map, since fractional errors only enter quadratically. Therefore, for weighting, our cleaning procedure can be applied without requiring precise knowledge of the tracer redshift distribution (or other properties), relying only on observed spectra at modest precision. As previously mentioned, there is a good analogy between our cleaning method and the ILC methods [11,12] commonly used for foreground cleaning in CMB data analysis; in both cases, the cleaning can be performed using only observed spectra. Of course, suboptimal weighting due to incorrectly assumed spectra is not the only concern when applying the cleaning procedure we have described. An additional complication is that, even if an optimal weighting is applied, there may be remaining uncertainty in modeling the cleaned spectra, because the bias and redshift distribution of the galaxy sample used for cleaning may be uncertain. Unfortunately, for redshift uncertainty, this is an obstacle that must be overcome by directly characterizing the redshift origin of the galaxies, as without knowledge of the galaxy redshift distribution the redshift origin of the cleaned field must remain uncertain as well. On the other hand, our cleaning procedure naturally accounts for the unknown bias, assuming that the bias is linear and simply rescales the spectra in a narrow bin (within which we can assume a redshift evolution). To see this, we note that the cleaning tracer is given by\nX \u00bc X i cigi \u00bc X i cibi\u0394i \u00f011\u00de\nwhere we have divided out the linear bias bi from the projected galaxy density field to give the projected matter density fluctuation \u0394i. Our expression for the weights ci \u00bc P j\u00f0Covgg\u00de\u22121ij C\u03bagjL implies that the resulting cleaning tracer (and hence the cleaned map) is independent of the linear bias, which can be seen as follows:\nX \u00bc X i cigi \u00bc X ij \u00f0Covgigj\u00de\u22121C\u03bagjL bi\u0394i\n\u00bc X ij 1 bibj \u00f0Cov\u0394i\u0394j\u00de\u22121bjC\u03ba\u0394jL bi\u0394i\n\u00bc X ij \u00f0Cov\u0394i\u0394j\u00de\u22121C\u03ba\u0394jL \u0394i; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere the bias has canceled out. Of course, this is only true if our cleaning weights are correct; however, we note that by our previous argument, our results are insensitive to small errors in the weights, and our cleaning procedure should be able to derive the weights sufficiently well from the measured spectra."

II to delens the low redshift contribution to the lensing field. Although the individual LSST galaxy window functions might not match well with the CMB lensing kernel, combining the samples using Eq. (4) results in an effective galaxy field X \u00bcPi cigi that has a window function WX \u00bcPi ciWgi which closely follows the CMB lensing kernel, as illustrated in Fig. 4. These high-z only lensing maps translate into high-z lensing spectra from redshifts (z > 0, 1.5, 1.9, 3.75 and 5)\nthat can be determined (assuming tracers can be used up to wave numbers of 0.3h Mpc\u22121, which translates into cleaned lensing spectra with Lmax \u00bc 200) at a signal-tonoise ratio of (83,33,29,18,13). The different lensing spectra are shown in Fig. 5; the spectra of the cleaned lensing fields can be compared with the spectrum of the full lensing field in green. As expected, the removal of the lowz structure leads to spectra with a lower amplitude and with the peak shifted to smaller scales (due to lensing occurring at greater distances). The reduction in sensitivity of these cleaned lensing fields to low-z structures enables a tomographic measurement of the amplitude of structure, \u03c38 at multiple redshifts, which can be determined at a precision given by \u223c2 times the lensing signal-to-noise ratio. This follows from the fact that each lensing field is sensitive to the amplitude of structure \u03c38, and hence the lensing power spectrum C\u03ba\u03baL is directly proportional to \u03c328, assuming all other parameters are held fixed. (Fixing other parameters appears to be a reasonable approximation for this forecast since we are\n123540-6\nonly testing for several-percent-level departures from \u039bCDM structure growth at high redshift, and other relevant parameters should be determined to much higher precision by the time the final CMB-S4 and LSST datasets are available). The top panel of Fig. 6 shows the determination of \u03c38 as a function of the redshift up to which cleaning is performed.\nUsing lensing alone, one can probe the amplitude of structure at redshifts (z \u00bc 0, 1.5, 1.9, 3.75, 5) to within \u223c\u00f00.6; 1.4; 1.5; 2.3; 3.3\u00de% respectively and \u223c\u00f00.3; 0.8; 0.9; 1.4; 1.8\u00de% if using Lmax \u00bc 400 instead of Lmax \u00bc 200. CMB lensing alone hence can probe the growth history over a range of uniquely high redshifts where the \u039bCDM model has not yet been tested extensively. We can further check that we are indeed insensitive to the low-z information after cleaning by examining the effect on the lensing window function W\u03ba, which appears quadratically in the computation of the power spectra as described by Eq. (7). Denoting Weff\u00f0z\u00de as the analogous term to \u00f0W\u03ba\u00de2 appearing in the cleaned lensing spectra, one can see that the effect of cleaning is to reduce and shift the peak of this kernel to higher redshifts\nWeff\u00f0z\u00de \u00bc \u00f0W\u03ba\u00de2 \u2212WXW\u03ba \u00f015\u00de\nThe above can be obtained by looking at the window function appearing in the cleaned lensing spectra, which in the noiseless limit is given by\nC\u03ba\u03ba;cL \u00bc C\u03ba\u03baL \u2212 C\u03baXL \u00bc Z\ndzH\u00f0z\u00de \u03c72\u00f0z\u00de \u00f0\u00f0W \u03ba\u00de2 \u2212WXW\u03ba\u00deP k \u00bc L\u00fe 1 2 \u03c7\u00f0z\u00de ; z\n\u00bc Z\ndzH\u00f0z\u00de \u03c72\u00f0z\u00de W eff\u00f0k\u00deP k \u00bc L\u00fe 1 2 \u03c7\u00f0z\u00de ; z\n\u00f016\u00de\n123540-7\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows the resulting Weff .

The small oscillations around zero arise because the shapes of the galaxy windows functions do not match perfectly with that of the lensing kernel; furthermore, some overlap exists between the galaxy bins, which leads to over-or undersubtraction of the lensing window. Perfect nulling can be achieved in the ideal case when the galaxy bins are nonoverlapping bins that are either much narrower than the distance over which the CMB lensing kernel varies or that have a redshift distribution that perfectly matches the CMB lensing kernel over the bin range."

            "heading": "IV. WEIGHING NEUTRINOS WITH HIGH REDSHIFT ONLY LENSING MAPS",
            "text": "A key goal of current cosmology and particle physics experiments is the measurement of the unknown mass of neutrinos [34]. Neutrinos initially behave as relativistic radiation in the early universe; as their temperature falls, they become nonrelativistic, giving an energy density that evolves like cold dark matter (CDM). A clear signature of massive neutrinos is a scale dependent suppression in the matter power spectrum, which can be understood as follows. On all scales, massive neutrinos contribute significantly to the total mean energy density of the universe, increasing its latetime expansion rate beyond the massless neutrino case; this increased expansion tends to suppress structure growth. However, on large scales, this is fully compensated by a corresponding increase in the strength of clustering and gravitational driving, causing massive neutrinos to produce the same structure growth as CDM. In contrast, on small scales, the growth suppression is not compensated because, due to the large thermal velocities that neutrinos have, they free-stream, erasing perturbations in the neutrino component. Measurement of this suppression is the primary way in\nwhich the neutrino mass sum P\nm\u03bd can be measured with cosmological observations [17,35]. This can be achieved by comparing the initial high redshift amplitude of structure obtained from the CMB power spectrum (via measurements of the optical depth) against a low redshift probe like CMB weak lensing [36,37]. However, one caveat is that, because CMB lensing probes the total projected matter distribution down to z \u00bc 0, it (along with nearly all other probes) is also sensitive to the growth suppression effects induced by dark energy. The suppression effect of neutrinos on the growth rate of the overdensity \u03b4CDM during matter domination is described by \u03b4CDM \u221d \u00bda 1\u221235f\u03bd on scales much smaller than the neutrino free-streaming scale [35,37],\nwhere f\u03bd is the fraction of matter-energy density in neutrinos, proportional to the neutrino mass. Dark energy can similarly cause a suppression of the growth of matter structure, often described as follows: \u03b4CDM \u221d \u00bdag\u00f0a\u00de , where g\u00f0a\u00de is a scale-independent damping factor (with a value < 1 as the dark energy density becomes significant). Since both neutrino mass and dark energy result in a suppression of structure growth, nonstandard dark energy physics could lead to a biased determination of the neutrino mass. We will here consider applying our cleaning method to obtain a high-redshift-only lensing map, and use this to constrain P m\u03bd. This is motivated by the fact that the damping factor due to dark energy g\u00f0a\u00de differs only from 1 when the dark energy density is non-negligible; hence, assuming that dark energy is only relevant below a certain low redshift, removing the lower redshift information means that the suppression effects in the matter power spectrum are due to neutrinos alone. We expect the use of a high-z lensing map to not greatly decrease the precision of a neutrino mass measurement for two reasons: first, upcoming measurements of neutrino mass are limited by our knowledge of the high-redshift amplitude of structure via the CMB optical depth, so that they are only weakly sensitive to a reduction in the precision of lower-redshift measurements; second, because the suppression signal is only logarithmic in a or redshift so that the size of the effect is similar regardless of whether we measure the low-z amplitude of structure at z \u00bc 0.5 or z \u00bc 3. We will test this expectation quantitatively in the next section, performing forecasts to investigate whether a high-z lensing map can give high-precision neutrino mass measurements with minimal dark energy model dependence. Before doing so, we can gain some intuition about why delensing the low redshift content helps decrease the neutrino mass bias by examining the lensing power spectrum Eq.

This damping factor g\u00f0z\u00de describes the suppression of growth in the presence of dark energy (due to potential decays on all scales); it is normalized such that it is unity during matter domination.\n123540-8\n(2) Dark energy can also affect the geometry of the universe by changing the redshift dependence of the radial comoving distance, \u03c7\u00f0z\u00de \u2192 \u03c70\u00f0z\u00de. We will argue in the following paragraphs that the effect of this on lensing is expected to be small at high redshifts once we fix the angular scale of the sound horizon; this scale is effectively fixed when we combine our lensing measurements with those of the primary CMB, which constrain the angle subtended by the sound horizon at very high precision.\nBy delensing the low redshift matter perturbations, we remove completely the effects that dark energy has on growth since there are no longer any affected matter perturbations contained in the high redshift lensing maps. The only possible effect that dark energy can have is on geometry by altering the radial comoving distance to redshift z given by\n\u03c7\u00f0z\u00de \u00bc Z z\n0\ndz0\nH\u00f0z0\u00de : \u00f018\u00de\nHowever, because the distance to recombination \u03c7\u22c6 \u00bc \u03c7\u00f01100\u00de is fixed to high accuracy by including CMB power spectrum data (via their measurement of the angular scale of the acoustic peaks) [39], in such an analysis \u03c7\u00f0z\u00de at high redshifts is well constrained and nearly unaffected by dark energy.

Using the above Fisher formalism, combining CMB-S4 lensing and primary CMB as well as large-scale structure observations from the full DESI BAO would place tighter bounds on the neutrino mass sum with constraints of \u223c20 meV. However, as discussed already in [9,17], the constraints of \u223c20 meV are derived in the framework of the \u039bCDM model and are hence, to some extent, modeldependent; extending the model by including effects like dark energy and curvature, which are degenerate with the effects produced by massive neutrinos, can degrade the constraints on neutrino mass significantly. These extensions are often required for robust measurement of P m\u03bd because the true lensing power spectrum could include unknown effects induced by nonstandard dark energy at low redshifts, which differs from the lensing power spectrum computed assuming \u039bCDM. Such deviations might mimic the neutrino mass signature leading to a biased inference of P m\u03bd.\nRather than extending the \u039bCDM model, we produce forecasts of constraints on P m\u03bd assuming \u039bCDM, but with a lensing map that only contains high redshift information. This approach has the advantage of being agnostic about the dark energy model\u2014assuming only that dark energy is negligible at sufficiently high redshifts\u2014and is simpler to implement than the alternative of taking into account all the possible dark energy scenarios in the model. The intuition behind our method is that since (we assume)\nthe effect of dark energy becomes dominant only at low redshifts, cleaning the low redshift contribution of the lensing maps removes the degeneracy caused by dark energy, leading to an unbiased measurement of P m\u03bd.

The dashed lines represent the base cases in which no cleaning is applied, whereas the solid lines correspond to the bias when our cleaning procedure is applied using galaxy bins up to a certain z only, following the prescription laid in Sec. II\nabove. It can be seen that in agreement with our intuition in Sec. IV, including all the LSST galaxy bins up to redshift 5 effectively reduces the neutrino mass sum bias to close to zero, with only minimal increase in the statistical error shown as the green bands.

Hence removing only the very low redshifts can still exacerbate the difference between the true cosmology and \u039bCDM compared to the case where no cleaning is applied; the reduction in bias only starts to occur when all the low redshifts containing significant dark energy contributions are removed. The lensing multipoles L used in the above forecast range from 20 to 200.

Our goal of obtaining a nearly model-independent constraint on P m\u03bd also limits our ability to exploit the full constraining power of BAO surveys (since current high resolution BAO are mostly at low redshifts which could be affected by dark\n123540-12\nenergy modeling); however, using a futuristic high redshift BAO measurement from Megamapper will allow neutrino constraints of order \u03c3\u00f0Pm\u03bd\u00de \u00bc 39 meV (\u03c3\u00f0Pm\u03bd\u00de \u00bc 34 meV if using Lmax \u00bc 400, corresponding to a scale cut of kcut \u00bc 0.6hMpc\u22121) as shown in Fig. 8. Here we only include the BAO at redshifts equal or greater to the redshifts over which we use the LSST galaxies, which explains the broadening of the errors at higher redshifts. Figure 9 illustrates that this cleaning method is flexible and can also work when the true cosmology has dark energy more complicated than that given by the w0 \u2212 wa parametrization. The dark energy equation of state in the upper panel, which is a toy example that oscillates with redshift, is not described using the w0 \u2212 wa framework, but the bias on the neutrino mass is still suppressed when using cleaned lensing maps."

            "text": "In this work, we discuss the production and application of a lensing map containing only high redshift information. A high-z mass map can be constructed in a modelinsensitive manner by subtracting suitably scaled correlated tracers, such as galaxy density maps, from the lensing field. Our lensing cleaning method is similar to that of delensing, with the critical difference that instead of minimizing the variance of the resultant delensed field including noise, we minimize only the lensing signal at low z.\nThe resulting high-z lensing map allows us to probe the growth of structure at redshifts which are currently not accessible to other cosmological probes. With CMB-S4 lensing and Rubin\u2013LSST galaxies (and a scale cut of k \u00bc 0.3hMpc\u22121, which corresponds to a usable Lmax of 200), we forecast measurements of the amplitude of structure at high redshifts z > 3.75 and z > 5 to within 2.3% and 3.3% respectively. We explore the impact of uncertainties in the lensing-galaxy cross spectrum in determining the cleaned lensing map and find that these uncertainties do not greatly affect the results. The high redshifts probed by the cleaned lensing maps also correspond to periods when dark energy, modification to general relativity and nonlinear effects due to baryonic physics are often assumed to be subdominant or at least less important than at lower redshifts. As an example application of this, we note that a high-zmass map could provide a clean and arguably less model-dependent constraint on the neutrino mass sum; we forecast that a high-z mass map constructed from CMB-S4 and Rubin-LSST galaxies can provide a competitive neutrino mass determination (\u03c3\u00f0Pm\u03bd\u00de \u00bc 62 meV or 39 meV including future high-z BAO), and show that this measurement has only negligible sensitivity to the presence of nonstandard dark energy models. Furthermore, the same cleaning method also removes potential degeneracies in the determination of neutrino mass sum with effects induced by many modified gravity models, as discussed in detail in Appendix A, and may reduce sensitivity to baryonic feedback (as in [2]) and matter nonlinearities. There are other potential applications of variants of our CMB lensing redshift-cleaning method. In Appendix B, we discuss cleaning certain redshifts to improve the signal-tonoise-ratio of lensing-galaxy cross-correlations. In particular, we find that removing the high redshift information from a lensing map using the CIB significantly improves the determination of parameters at low-z, such as linear bias and growth factor, by 40%\u201360% for current and upcoming CMB surveys. Our redshift-cleaning technique might also be useful for mitigating the intrinsic alignment contamination to the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and cosmic shear, if contributions to CMB lensing from source galaxy redshifts can be removed. We hope to explore these and other applications of redshift-cleaning methods and their implementation in data in future work."

            "text": "AND ITS SENSITIVITY TO MODIFIED GRAVITY\nAn additional advantage of our low-z cleaning procedure is that it can make constraints from the cleaned lensing field insensitive to modified gravity effects. This is especially relevant at low redshifts where nonstandard effects are particularly well motivated due to the still poorly understood cosmic acceleration [46,47]. Theories that propose deviations from general relativity can have both different background evolution equations and different growth of structure on scales where the neutrino mass suppression occurs. We will argue in the following paragraphs that any degeneracy of neutrino mass with low-z modified gravity effects can similarly be broken when the low-z information about the growth of structures is removed, as described previously. Modified theories of gravity differ from general relativity in two primary ways (e.g., [48]). First, they change the relationship between the two scalar potentials of the perturbed Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric. With a metric in the conformal Newtonian gauge for scalar perturbations, ds2 \u00bc \u00f01\u00fe 2\u03c8\u00dedt2 \u2212 a2\u00f01 \u2212 2\u03d5\u00dedx2, the relation \u03c8 \u00bc \u03d5 is no longer true even in the absence of anisotropic stress. Second, the relation between the potential and density perturbations, as related by the Poisson equation, is also modified. In the following discussion, we consider modified gravity theories that can be parametrized by the following two equations [49]4:\n\u22072\u03c8\u00f0\u03c7; x\u00de \u00bc 4\u03c0G\u03c1\u0304m\u00bd1\u00fe \u03bc\u00f0\u03c7\u00de \u03b4\u00f0\u03c7; x\u00de; \u00f0A1\u00de \u03a8\u00f0\u03c7; x\u00de \u00bc \u00bd1\u00fe \u03a3\u00f0\u03c7\u00de \u03a8GR\u00f0\u03c7; x\u00de; \u00f0A2\u00de\nwhere \u03a8\u2261 \u00f0\u03c8 \u00fe \u03d5\u00de=2 is the so-called Weyl potential [1] entering into the lensing potential and the subscript \u201cGR\u201d indicates the quantity in general relativity. The functions \u03bc and \u03a3 are exactly zero in the standard \u039bCDM model. Here, we ignore the scale dependence of \u03bc and \u03a3, although it is straightforward to apply the following discussion to the case where \u03bc and \u03a3 vary slowly with scale. Now we calculate the lensing mass field \u03ba\u0303 from the modified Weyl potential (A2) above. The first term of (A2)\nresults in the lensing convergence in general relativity, \u03ba, while the second term changes the lensing convergence by: \u0394\u03ba\u00f0n\u0302\u00de \u00bc \u2207\u03032 Z \u03c7\n0\nd\u03c7 H\u00f0z\u00deW\u03ba\u00f0z\u00de\n\u03c72 \u03a3\u00f0\u03c7\u00de\u2207\u22122\u03b4\u00f0\u03c7; \u03c7n\u0302\u00de; \u00f0A3\u00de\nwhere \u2207\u0303 is the covariant derivative on the unit sphere. We assume that \u03a3 varies slowly with \u03c7 so that we can pull \u03a3 out of the integral. Furthermore, we assume that the modification is only important at low redshifts. Then, the lensing convergence above could be written as\n\u0394\u03baL \u2243 \u03a3\u03balow;L; \u00f0A4\u00de\nwhere we have moved \u03a3 outside of the integral. Under modified gravity, and in the notation of the draft, the CMB lensing field is therefore affected as:\n\u03ba\u0303 \u00bc \u03bahigh \u00fe \u03balow\u00f01\u00fe \u03a3\u00de \u00f0A5\u00de\nOn the other hand, a galaxy tracer will be affected by modified gravity through the Poisson equation and the growth of the density perturbations changes [49]. Assuming that the modification changes the growth of the linear perturbation by an overall amplitude, we can write the galaxy tracer at low z as X\u0303 \u00bc \u00f01\u00feD\u00deX where X represents the case of standard cosmology. If the galaxy tracer is originally correlated with the low-z lensing field by TL in general relativity, the galaxy tracer is given by:\nX\u0303L \u00bc TL\u00f01\u00feD\u00de\u03balow;L: \u00f0A6\u00de\nIf we require that the weights for cleaning are consistent with the measured spectra, our cleaning procedure will be immune to these scaling functions. To see this, we note that the observed spectra, C\u03baXL and C XX L , are rescaled, respectively, by \u00f01\u00fe \u03a3\u00de\u00f01\u00feD\u00de and \u00f01\u00feD\u00de2. The observed galaxy tracer, X\u0302L, is also rescaled by (1\u00feD), the second term in Eq. (1) becomes \u00f01\u00fe \u03a3\u00de\u03balow which exactly cancels with the modified low-z lensing convergence involved in the first term of Eq. (1) [i.e. the second term in Eq. (A5)]."

            "text": "a. Angular power spectra\nTo illustrate the above intuition, we use a toy galaxy field, the CIB field (See Appendix B 1 for details about its modeling) and the lensing convergence field to construct the 2-point angular power spectra: C\u03ba\u03baL ; C \u03bag L ; C \u03baCIB L , C\u03baCIBl \u00bc L and CCIBCIBL . In the Limber approximation, the angular power spectra are given by\nC\u03b1\u03b2l \u00bc Z dzH\u00f0z\u00de \u03c72\u00f0z\u00de W \u03b1\u00f0z\u00deW\u03b2\u00f0z\u00deP k \u00bc l\u00fe 1 2 \u03c7\u00f0z\u00de ; z ; \u00f0B4\u00de\nwhere \u03b1; \u03b2 \u2208 \u00f0\u03ba; g;CIB\u00de.\n123540-15\nThe CIB window function is shown in Eq. (B3). For the galaxy field, we consider a Gaussian galaxy density field with mean redshift z0 \u00bc 0.1 and width \u03c3z \u00bc 2 with a galaxy density of n\u0304 \u00bc 1.06 arcmin2 and window function Wg given by\nWg \u00bc b1Azffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2\u03c0\u03c32 p e \u2212\u00f0z\u2212z0\u00de2 2\u03c32 : \u00f0B5\u00de\nHere b1 is the linear bias with a fiducial value of b1 \u00bc 2, Az is a redshift dependent amplitude which is degenerate with b1 and in this example we take as values Alow \u00bc 1.2 for z < 0.5 and Ahigh \u00bc 1.2 for z > 0.5. This factor is applied to the CIB and lensing kernels as well.\nb. Fisher analysis\nFor the CIB delensing application, we also consider lensing experiments with higher noise levels up to 10 \u03bcK0 attainable by a Simons Observatory-like experiment with the specifications: beam FWHM \u00bc 1.40, \u0394T \u00bc 8 \u03bcK0, \u0394P \u00bc 11.3 \u03bcK0 and fsky \u00bc 0.3 and lensing experiments attained with current ground-based observations such as AdvACT [53] with beam FWHM \u00bc 1.40, \u0394T \u00bc 15 \u03bcK0, \u0394P \u00bc 15.3 \u03bcK0 and fsky \u00bc 0.3. The minimum variance reconstruction noise by combining the different temperature and polarization channels for the different experiments is shown in Fig. 2. The observables we consider are the lensing-galaxy cross spectrum C\u03bagL , the galaxy auto spectrum C gg L and the CMB lensing auto spectrum, C\u03ba\u03baL or the high redshift cleaned version C\u03bac\u03bacL which is related to the uncleaned one via the CIB-lensing correlation \u03c1L, C\u03bac\u03bacL \u00bc C\u03ba\u03baL \u00f01 \u2212 \u03c12L\u00de. In the above example, since the overlap between the galaxy field and the CIB field is very small, we assume that C\u03bacgL \u2248 C \u03bag L . We use a Gaussian covariance matrix Cov\u03b11\u03b21;\u03b12\u03b22La;Lb where \u03b11;2; \u03b21;2 \u2208 \u00f0\u03ba; g\u00de. For the CMB lensing convergence and the auto and cross power spectra entering the covariance matrix we take into account the lensing reconstruction noise N\u03ba\u03baL and the shot noise NggL \u00bc 1=n\u0304.\nWe construct the Fisher matrix as\nFij \u00bc X \u03b11\u03b21 ; \u03b12\u03b22 X L \u2202C\u03b11\u03b21L \u2202\u03b8i h Cov\u03b11\u03b21;\u03b12\u03b22La;Lb i \u22121 \u2202C\u03b12\u03b22L \u2202\u03b8j \u00f0B6\u00de\nwhere \u03b8 \u00bc fb1; Alow; Ahighg are the parameters that we vary."

            "text": "Fig. 11 shows that for a CMB-S4 CMB experiment, our method of removing the high redshift content of the lensing map can lead to 60% improvement in the determination of the linear bias and 50% improvement in a measurement of the amplitude of structure. The main factor in tightening the constraints still comes from the degree of correlation between the CIB and lensing. This improvement is degraded when using the CIB field with a smaller degree of correlation. For those cases, the CMB noise levels are not that important, with experiments like SO and AdvACT achieving similar improvements of 20%\u201330%.\n[1] A. Lewis and A.
