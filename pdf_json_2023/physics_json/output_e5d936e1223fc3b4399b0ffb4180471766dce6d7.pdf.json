This topological condition couples together the secondary and tertiary str uct ures of the resulting ccDNA topoisomer, a constraint that is not present in otherwise identical nicked or linear DNAs. Fixing L has a range of str uct ural, energetic and functional consequences. Here we consider ho w L ha ving different integer values ( that is, different superhelicities ) affects ccDNA molecules. The approaches used are primarily theoretical, and are de v eloped from a historical perspective. In brief, processes that either relax or increase superhelicity, or repartition what is there, may either release or require free energy. The energies in v olv ed can be substantial, sufficient to influence many events, directly or indirectly. Here two examples are developed. The changes of unconstrained superhelicity that occur during nucleosome at tac hment and release are examined. And a simple theoretical model of superhelically driven DNA str uct ural transitions is described that calculates equilibrium distributions for populations of identical topoisomers. This model is used to examine how these distributions change with superhelicity and other factors, and applied to analyze several situations of biological interest. Gr aphical abstr act D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /nar/artic/1/22/7442541 by Idian Intitute of Tenology Ptna user on 12 Jauary 2024 Introduction Linking numbers and superhelicity In 1963 the genomic DNA of murine polyoma virus was shown to have the structure of a flexible duplex ring ( 1 ) . It soon became clear that closing a linear DNA segment into a ring involves the formation of two additional phosphodiester bonds, each joining a strand end on one side of the segment to a strand end on the other. The two strands of a DNA duplex have opposite 5 \u2032 \u2192 3 \u2032 phosphodiester bond orientations, and this chemical directionality must be preserved at closure. So to form a ring, each strand can only bind to its own end, and not to the end of the other strand. Thus, each strand of the resulting closed circular DNA ( ccDNA ) duplex also forms a ring, these two rings are oppositely oriented, and they interlink. Received: March 26, 2023.

For commercial re-use, please contact journals.pe Each ccDNA has a linking number L , the number of times either of its strands links through the closed ring formed by the other strand ( 2 ) . L is an integer, and has a fixed value so long as both DNA strands remain covalently closed. This makes the linking number a topological attribute of the ccDNA. Continuous deformations such as duplex bendings or twistings, single or double strand binding or release events, or local transitions to other secondary structures cannot change the linking number of a ccDNA so long as both of its strands remain continuous. Only during transient discontinuities\u2014temporary breaks in one or both strands\u2014can L change. Otherwise identical linear DNA molecules can be closed into ccDNAs having different linking numbers. The resulting domains are distinct topoisomers , so named because they differ only in topology.

            "text": "In 1963 the genomic DNA of murine polyoma virus was shown to have the structure of a flexible duplex ring ( 1 ) . It soon became clear that closing a linear DNA segment into a ring involves the formation of two additional phosphodiester bonds, each joining a strand end on one side of the segment to a strand end on the other. The two strands of a DNA duplex have opposite 5 \u2032 \u2192 3 \u2032 phosphodiester bond orientations, and this chemical directionality must be preserved at closure. So to form a ring, each strand can only bind to its own end, and not to the end of the other strand. Thus, each strand of the resulting closed circular DNA ( ccDNA ) duplex also forms a ring, these two rings are oppositely oriented, and they interlink.\nReceived: March 26, 2023.

L is an integer, and has a fixed value so long as both DNA strands remain covalently closed. This makes the linking number a topological attribute of the ccDNA. Continuous deformations such as duplex bendings or twistings, single or double strand binding or release events, or local transitions to other secondary structures cannot change the linking number of a ccDNA so long as both of its strands remain continuous.

( Note that L 0 need not be an integer; it won\u2019t be if he center of this distribution falls between two topoisomers. ) he linking difference \u03b1 of a DNA topoisomer, also called its uperhelicity ( 3 ) , is the difference between its actual linking umber L and its relaxed value L 0 : \u03b1 = L \u2212 L 0 . A topoisoer with \u03b1 = 0 is said to be superhelical ; if \u03b1 \u2248 0 it may e regarded as relaxed. Superhelicity can be either positive or egative, depending on the sign of \u03b1. Informal comparisons etween levels of superhelicity in domains of different lengths an be made by using the superhelix density \u03c3 = \u03b1/ L 0 , which s the fractional superhelicity.\nopological domains topological domain is any portion of a DNA molecule on hich the constraint of a constant linking number can be imosed. ccDNAs are one type of domain. Bacterial chromoomes often are circular, as are many viral genomes. Mitohondrial and chloroplast DNAs also are circular, as are extrahromosomal DNA elements such as plasmids and episomes. ome cancer cell types contain variable amounts of circular NAs ( 4 ) . These can be pieces of chromosomal DNA that ave been excised and circularized, and then amplified to high opy numbers ( 5 ) .\nLinear DNA segments held rigidly at both ends are another ype of topological domain. One can conceptually close each f the strands of such a segment by formally regarding its nds as being connected by a fixed path through space, with he paths that close the two strands never intersecting either hemselves or each other, or either strand of the segment. This llows a linking number L to be specified that depends only n the structure of the DNA within the segment. As with ccDAs, this type of domain also will have a relaxed linking numer L 0 , and superhelical states with linking differences ( i.e. uperhelicities ) \u03b1 = L \u2212 L 0 .\nDomain boundaries may be formed by DNA binding events uch as to a scaffold, a membrane, a molecular complex, or to nother region of DNA. In the latter case, if the connected reions are genomically close so the intervening duplex is short, he domain may form a loop. If the sites of attachment are idely separated or on different molecules, they could form ore complex networks of coordinately constrained duplex NA segments. Some types of domain boundaries could be elatively permanent. Others may arise from occasional or ransitory events.\nThe genomic DNAs of both prokaryotes ( 6 ) and eukaryotes 7 ) are partitioned into topological domains in vivo . Now it ppears that virtually every biological DNA is superhelically onstrained at some stage of its natural existence. This makes t particularly important to consider how superhelicity affects he many processes in which DNA participates.\nNA domain structure he overall structure of a duplex DNA topological domain such as a ccDNA ) is comprised of two structural sub-types. ts large scale structure is described by a curve C, effectively he molecular central axis curve. The tertiary structure of the omain is the shape of this curve. In a ccDNA, C also may e regarded as being closed into a flexible ring. C should be hosen so that either DNA strand links through C as often as t links through its complementary strand.\nThe secondary structure of a domain describes how either strand of its DNA duplex wraps around this central axis curve. Under most physiological conditions DNA favors B-form helical structures. But certain sequences also can occur in other conformations, as described below. Each secondary structure may be characterized by specifying its unstressed helicity, the twist rate of either strand about the central axis curve C when relaxed in this conformation. For flexible structures such as unpaired regions one also must consider how their actual helicities deviate from their unstressed values.\nThe overall structure of a DNA domain is described by specifying its secondary and tertiary structures. That is, one specifies how its local secondary structure twists around its tertiary structure curve C at each position as one moves along the domain.\nIn the models presented below domain structures such as these are analyzed at different levels of resolution and at different superhelicities."

            "text": "The nature of superhelicity can best be understood by considering a ccDNA topoisomer ( a duplex ring such as the murine polyoma virus genome ) whose linking number is L . Fixing L at an integer value imposes a topological constraint that has several important effects. These do not occur in otherwise identical linear or nicked circular molecules, where linking numbers are not fixed. These effects are the collective consequences of four attributes of superhelicity.\n( 1 ) The superhelicity of a topoisomer can only be changed b y tr ansiently cutting one or both of its strands and religating them with a different linking number . So any process in which both DNA strands remain covalently continuous cannot change a domain\u2019s superhelicity. It can, however, change how that fixed amount of superhelicity is accommodated. ( 2 ) A ccDNA topoisomer with linking number L can only sample conformations whose strands interlink exactly L times . Otherwise identical topoisomers differing only in superhelicity have disjoint sets of conformational states accessible to them. So distinct topoisomers under identical conditions must respond to their respective superhelicities in different ways. As a domain becomes more superhelical, the conformations it can sample become more over-linked or under-linked. ( 3 ) Energy is required to impose superhelicity; energy is released by relaxing it . The superhelical free energy of entirely B-form plasmids in vitro has been shown to be quadratic in \u03b1 over a wide range of linking differences, both positive and negative ( 8 ) , and to be inversely proportional to plasmid length N ( 9 ) :\nG (\u03b1) = q 2 N \u03b12 . ( 1 )\nMeasured values of the coefficient q range from 2200 RT to 2440 RT at T = 310 K ( = 37 \u25e6C ) ( 9 ,10 ) . ( Most calculations reported here will use an intermediate value, q = 2350 RT . ) The temperature dependence of q also is known ( 11\u201313 ) . Any process that alters the effective superhelicity of a topological domain will have energetic consequences. Bringing a domain closer to its relaxed condition releases free energy and hence is favorable, while introducing superhelicity requires free energy. If state 1 has linking\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\ndifference \u03b11 distributed among N 1 base pairs, and state 2 has linking difference \u03b12 distributed among a possibly different number N 2 of base pairs, then by Eq. ( 1 ) the change in superhelical free energy involved in going from state 1 to state 2 is\nG (\u03b1) = q 2 ( \u03b12 2 N 2 \u2212 \u03b1 2 1 N 1 ) . ( 2 )\nSubstantial amounts of energy can be involved. If a pBR322 plasmid ( N = 4361 bp ) initially at superhelix density \u03c3 = \u22120.055 is relaxed by three turns, going from \u03b11 = \u221223 turns to \u03b12 = -20 turns, the free energy change due to this relaxation is G = \u221221.4 kcal / mol at T = 310 K. The free energy of superhelicity G ( \u03b1) in Eq. ( 1 ) is a simple quadratic. Its graph is an upward opening parabola in \u03b1 with vertex at \u03b1 = 0. So, the energy difference G produced by a fixed amount of relaxation \u03b1 = \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 is not constant. Instead, it increases as the superhelicity becomes more extreme, either positive or negative. This happens because, as \u03b1 moves further away from the relaxed state \u03b1 = 0, the parabola grows more steep. Eventually a threshold superhelicity is reached, at which this fixed amount of relaxation \u03b1 yields enough energy to influence other processes. In biologically relevant situations, the energy released by fractional relaxations of superhelicity can make important, sometimes dominant, contributions to driving their causative processes, and may affect other events. Rates of occurrence of phenomena that provide fixed amounts of relaxation may vary with superhelicity. ( 4 ) Fixing a topoisomer \u2032 s linking number L couples together its secondary and tertiary structures Thermal buffeting can cause fluctuations of the local twist of a DNA ( i.e. the local helicity of its duplex at each position ) and deformations of its shape in space ( its tertiary structure ) . But in a topological domain these changes are not independent. Fixing the linking number couples these levels of structure together. This is the substance of what here is called Lebowitz \u2032 s Law of Superhelicity: [As a mathematical property of simple, closed, smooth curves in 3-space, Eq. ( 3 ) was proved by Calugareanu ( 14 ) and generalized by White to higher dimensions ( 15 ) . Methods to calculate its parameters were developed by Fuller ( 16 ,17 ) . So in mathematics, this equation is commonly named for these three mathematicians. But the biological fact that it describes - that the secondary and tertiary structures of a ccDNA are topologically coupled - was discovered and explored by Lebowitz ( 2 , 3 , 18 ) . So in biology Eq. ( 3 ) may be appropriately called Lebowitz\u2019s law.]\nL = T + W. ( 3 )\nIn this equation, L is the domain \u2032 s linking number, the number of times either of its closed strands links through its central axis curve C. So long as both strands remain closed L has a fixed integer value.\nT is the total twist of the domain, the number of times either strand S of its duplex rotates around the molecular central axis curve C ( 19 ) . T is the sum of the helical windings around C of all base pairs in the domain. It is an attribute of the succession of secondary structures that are present, and\nof how they are torsionally deformed. As these properties can vary continuously, so can T .\nW is the domain \u2032 s writhe ( 16 ) . W is a geometric parameter determined by the shape of the central axis curve C, which for a ccDNA can be regarded as closed. If C is both closed and planar, it will have W = 0 ( 17 ) . Only when W = 0 does the number of times the two curves ( C and S) link through each other equal the number of times that S rotates around C. Bendings and non-planar warpings of C can alter W . These deformations may be driven by mechanical stresses, thermal fluctuations or the binding, release or activities of other molecules and complexes.\nBoth W and T can change continuously as a DNA domain fluctuates or is acted upon. But in a ccDNA topoisomer their sum, which is L , must remain a fixed integer. In this way the condition of superhelicity, the fixing of the linking number of a domain, creates a topological coupling between its secondary and tertiary structures. This coupling does not occur in less constrained structures such as linear DNA segments or nicked circular duplexes ( ncDNA ) .\nThese four attributes together have many important consequences, some of which are explored below."

            "text": "A topoisomer with \u03b1 = 0 must be deformed away from its relaxed condition, either by writhing or by twisting or both. Writhing deformations may involve the formation, extension, or resolution of loops, plectonemes ( helically interwound duplexes ) or toroidal supercoils, and perhaps of other nonplanar structures. Changes of twist can occur both as transitions to non-B conformations and as torsional deformations of the resulting succession of secondary structures away from their unstressed helicities.\nThe superhelicity of a topoisomer can be continuously repartitioned among twistings, writhings and conformational transitions, provided only that Lebowitz \u2032 s law always is satisfied. The coupling this law expresses creates intricate interactions among these possibilities, which will vary with domain length, base sequence, environmental conditions, superhelicity and other imposed constraints.\nSome of these conformational possibilities are relatively fixed, while others may vary more freely. For example, formation of a nucleosome involves wrapping 147 bp of DNA around a histone core as a toroidal supercoil. This alters its writhe and its twist by amounts W and T , respectively. By Lebowitz \u2032 s law,\n\u03b1 = W + T + \u03b1r . ( 4 ) Here, \u03b1r is the residual superhelicity, the portion of \u03b1 that remains after accounting for the deformations that occur, due in this case to nucleosome binding. Once a nucleosome has bound, the rest of its domain can fluctuate, but now it can only sample states of twist and writhe consistent with the residual amount \u03b1r of superhelicity it experiences. In this way nucleosome binding constrains a portion of the superhelicity of a domain, leaving the balance ( \u03b1r ) unconstrained.\nRegions of altered secondary structure provide another example of constrained superhelicity, as described below. ( Because transitions from B-DNA to these altered structures usually do not greatly affect writhe, the models developed here use W = 0. )\nConformational transitions and binding or release events cannot change the actual superhelicity \u03b1 of a domain in which\nt r c w\ns s r t m t u p i c\nS A f T h p b v p u f n o o l i l s\nt l h c s p c s\nD e a p p a c h i o s o w\nI D T s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nhey occur, because no strands are cut. Their actions can only epartition the fixed amount of superhelicity that is present by onstraining some of it as specific changes of twist T and / or rithe W . The original experiments that assessed the free energy of uperhelicity were performed on plasmids that were free in olution, so all their superhelicity was unconstrained. For this eason the same free energy expression ( Eq. 1 ) is here applied o unconstrained superhelicity \u03b1r as was found in these experients to hold for the actual superhelicity \u03b1. But it is important o keep in mind the essential difference between these two. The nconstrained superhelicity \u03b1r may vary continuously as the artitioning of superhelicity changes, whereas the superhelicty \u03b1 itself remains a fixed integer so long as no strands are ut.\nuperhelicity and DNA secondary structures n unconstrained DNA duplex commonly occurs as a fully B-\norm double helix. But other secondary structures can occur. hese include strand separations, left-handed Z-form double elices, cruciforms, H-form triple helices, R-loops, quadrulexes and others. Some alternate structures require specific ase sequences to form. Cruciforms need a high degree of inerted repeat symmetry so each strand can fold back and base air with itself. H-DNA requires mirror symmetric homoprine or homopyrimidine runs. The G-quadruplex forms from our runs of G\u2019s in close proximity, and Z-form prefers alterating purine-pyrimidine sequences. Conformations that can ccur in any sequence still may favor some sequences over thers. Although any base pair can separate, under physioogical conditions this transition requires less energy, hence s more favored, within A+T-rich regions than elsewhere. Roops could happen in any transcribed region, but prefer to tart at sites where the coding strand is G-rich.\nThe unstressed helicities of different DNA secondary strucures vary widely. The B-form has the largest right-handed heicity, on average about +35 \u25e6 / bp ( 20 ) . The left-handed Z-form as unstressed helicity of \u221230 \u25e6/ bp ( 21 ) , while unstressed cruiforms and strand separations are untwisted. But single DNA trands are quite flexible. By rotating each strand of an unaired region around the other, hence also around the local entral axis curve C, large changes of twist can be made at a mall cost in free energy.\nBecause B-form is the favored conformation for relaxed NA under physiological conditions, it takes an input of free nergy to drive a susceptible region into another structure. In topological domain substantial amounts of energy can be rovided for this purpose by the relaxation of residual suerhelicity that occurs when a B-form region transforms to nother conformation whose right-handed helicity is signifiantly smaller than that of B-DNA. When such a transition appens in a nicked or linear DNA, any local change of helicty it produces can propagate either to the ends of the segment r to the nick, and there be relaxed by rotation. But when tranitions occur in a topological domain, the total change T f twist they provide alters the partitioning of superhelicity, hich affects the entire domain as described by Eq. 4 above.\nnteractions that affect superhelicity N A topoisomer ases o change a domain \u2032 s superhelicity, one or both of its DNA trands must be transiently cut, then religated with a different\nlinking number. Topoisomerases are enzymes that act in this way ( 22 ) .\nTOPO1 s are topoisomerases that cut one DNA strand and allow the two ends this cut creates to rotate around the domain \u2032 s central axis curve before ligation. This action changes the linking number by a multiple of one. TOPO1s allow either positively or negatively superhelical domains to relax, but they do not introduce superhelicity beyond what thermal buffeting enables at equilibrium, as this would require an input of energy that they cannot provide.\nTOPO2 s are topoisomerases that make transient double strand DNA cuts. These enzymes pass a nearby intact section of duplex through the gap their cut creates, then ligate the cut. When this happens in a ccDNA domain it changes the linking number L by \u00b12, the sign depending on the direction of passage.\nGyrases are a subclass of TOPO2s that use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to drive the DNA into more superhelical, hence higher energy, collections of states. TOPO2s that are not gyrases tend only to relax domains, but gyrases can increase their levels of superhelicity. Negatively supercoiling gyrases are present in many prokaryotes, while positively supercoiling gyrases occur in some thermophilic archaea ( 23 ) .\nIn bacteria, the competing activities of TOPO1s and gyrases tune the basal levels of superhelicity within domains. This tuning can adjust the transcriptional activities of genes and operons to meet changing metabolic demands. As Esc heric hia coli switches from stationary to growth phase, for example, the ATP+ADP energy charge of the cell increases. This increases gyrase activity, and hence also the basal levels of negative superhelicity within domains. This change of superhelicity helps redirect the organism \u2032 s transcriptional program, up-regulating genes and operons whose products are needed in growth, and down-regulating others ( 24 ) .\nWith rare exceptions, eukaryotic TOPO2s are not gyrases. They tend only to relax DNA, on average relieving both superhelicity and mechanical tension as they make their strand passages. In the absence of transcription, eukaryotic genomic DNA commonly is relaxed, while prokaryotic DNA domains have their basal levels of superhelicity determined by competitions between TOPO1s and gyrases."

It can, however, change how that fixed amount of superhelicity is accommodated.\nThroughout transcription both DNA strands remain covalently continuous. So the level of superhelicity in a topological domain does not change when transcription occurs within it. But the RNA polymerase complex ( RNAP ) torques a bow wave of over-twist ahead of itself and leaves a wake of undertwist behind ( 25 ,26 ) . This repartitions superhelical twistings and tertiary structural deformations between the upstream and downstream regions of the domain, but it cannot change its overall level of superhelicity. ( In the literature such repartitionings sometimes are referred to as \u2018dynamic supercoiling\u2019. )\nAs over-twist propagates into the DNA ahead of the RNAP and under-twist propagates behind, both may partially transduce into plectonemes or other writhed forms.

It is important to recognize that this view is not always accurate. The linking number, and hence also superhelicity, need not partition itself neatly into a part that manifests only upstream of the RNAP and a part that manifests only downstream, with L ( or \u03b1) being the sum of the two ( 17 ) . W also can depend on the dispositions of the upstream and downstream parts relative to each other.\nTo assess the level of upstream under-twist that transcription generates, a probe may be used that, when placed within a reference plasmid, is known to change conformation at a specific ( negative ) superhelix density \u03c3u . This probe is placed upstream of a transcription start site ( TSS ) , and transcription is allowed to occur. If the probe is driven into its altered conformation, then its site is inferred to have experienced an unconstrained ( i.e. residual ) superhelix density of at least \u03c3u .\nAs detected by a strand separating probe, RNAP translocation during eukaryotic transcription induces an effective negative superhelix density of at least \u03c3 = \u22120.07 in the 1500 bp immediately upstream of ( i.e. behind ) the RNAP complex, and \u03c3 = +0.07 downstream ( 27 ,28 ) . Simultaneous transcription of divergent genes can generate \u03c3 = \u22120.14 in the promoter region separating them.\nAn important function of eukaryotic TOPO1 is to relieve transcription-induced positive unconstrained superhelicity ahead of the RNAP complex, which otherwise could impede its progress ( 29 ) . However, if this stress relief were limited to one side of the RNAP alone it would preferentially relieve one type of twist over the other. TOPO1s may act more frequently on one side of the RNAP than the other, but to maintain the overall superhelicity of a domain in homeostatic balance the same absolute amounts of twist deformation, on average, would need to be relieved on both sides."

The structure of a DNA-IHF co-crystal shows that binding creates a 160 \u25e6 bend in the DNA ( 30 ) . A twist wave could pass unimpeded through an empty IHF binding site. But when IHF is bound the wave encounters this bend, which it tries to turn through the highly viscous solvent. The resistance it encounters could instead initiate a plectonemically interwound supercoil. Thus, superhelicity within a transcriptionally active domain may be packaged differently when IHF is bound than when it is not, with binding transducing twist to writhe.

            "heading": "Superhelicity and nucleosomes",
            "text": "In eukaryotes, histone octamers bind DNA to form nucleosomes. Each nucleosome rigidly holds 147 bp of DNA, preventing them from participating in the transitions and the twisting and writhing deformations by which unconstrained superhelicity is expressed elsewhere within its topological domain ( 31 ) . This effectively removes those base pairs from the domain. Each nucleosome also stabilizes one ( negative ) turn of superhelicity, preventing it from affecting the rest of the domain ( 32 ) . The superhelix density of the DNA that one\nnucleosome winds, when considered alone, is \u03c3 = \u03b1/ L 0 = \u22121 / ( 147 / 10.5 ) = \u22120.07. Curiously, this is the same superhelix density as was measured upstream of ( i.e. behind ) a transcribing RNAP. This arrangement has two consequences.\nFirst, the unconstrained negative superhelicity that is released into a domain as nucleosomes detach ahead of an RNAP complex almost balances the overtwist that the transcribing complex generates. The only portion that remains unbalanced is the residual superhelicity present in the linker regions between nucleosomes. This offset of over-twist by nucleosome unbinding diminishes the rate at which positive residual superhelicity accumulates ahead of an RNAP.\nSecond, reforming nucleosomes behind a transcription complex does not alter the residual superhelix density of the remaining unbound regions. All regions have superhelix densities \u03c3 = \u22120.07, but the portions within nucleosomes are constrained while the rest is not. So the high negative superhelix densities that transcription generates behind an RNAP remain available in nearby linker regions.\nNow consider how nucleosome attachment or release affects superhelical free energy. Suppose a nucleosome binds to a superhelical domain of length N > 147 bp and residual linking difference \u03b1r . When it binds, the effective length of the superhelical region decreases to N \u2212 147 bp, and the residual superhelicity in that region changes to \u03b1r + 1. So the free energy difference between the bound and unbound states is\nG (\u03b1r ) = q 2 ( (\u03b1r + 1) 2 N \u2212 147 \u2212 \u03b12 r N )\n= q 2 N(N \u2212 147)\n( 147 \u03b12 r + 2 N\u03b1r + N ) . ( 5 )\nThis free energy is negative, assisting binding, when \u03b1r lies between the roots of the above quadratic ( i.e. parabola ) , both of which are negative. The range between them where G ( \u03b1r ) < 0 varies with domain length N , but not with q . The superhelicity that most favors binding occurs at the minimum of G ( \u03b1r ) , which is at \u03b1r , m = \u2212N / 147 and has energy difference G ( \u03b1r , m ) = \u2212q / 294. Using q = 2350 RT at temperature T = 310 K, one finds that G ( \u03b1r , m ) = \u22124.92 kcal / mol, enough to substantially aid binding. The superhelix density corresponding to \u03b1r , m is \u03c3m = \u221210.5 / 147 = \u22120.07, which also is independent of N . Intriguingly, this is the measured superhelix density generated in the upstream region behind the RNAP, which is where nucleosomes would form on newly transcribed DNA.\nA similar approach can be used to examine how positive unconstrained superhelicity ahead of an RNAP complex affects nucleosome detachment. The initial state of this domain again has N base pairs and unconstrained superhelicity \u03b1r . But when one nucleosome detaches the effective domain length increases to N + 147 base pairs and the single negative superhelical turn that was stabilized by this nucleosome is released into the domain, changing its unconstrained superhelicity from \u03b1r to \u03b1r \u2212 1. In this case the difference in superhelical free energy is\nG (\u03b1r ) = q 2 ( (\u03b1r \u2212 1) 2 N + 147 \u2212 \u03b12 r N )\n= q 2 N(N + 147)\n( \u2212 147 \u03b12 r \u2212 2 N\u03b1r + N ) .

As an example, if N = 500 bps the roots of this quadratic re \u03b1r , 1 = \u22127.27 turns and \u03b1r , 2 = 0.47 turns.

This fractionlly relaxes its unconstrained superhelicity from \u03b1 to \u03b1r , as hown by Eq. ( 4 ) . ( Here we assume that W = 0. ) When the nergy released by this fractional relaxation exceeds the enrgy cost of a transition that produces it, this transition beomes favored to occur. A simple theoretical strategy can be sed to analyze this situation. A generic equilibrium model of competitive superhelical ransitions is developed below. This model can be applied o transitions between any DNA secondary structures, proided their geometries, flexibilities and transition energetics re known. Then this approach is used to analyze how superelicity affects transitions involving strand separation ( 33 ,34 ) , ruciform extrusion ( 35 ) and BZ transitions ( 36 ) , the three ypes of alternate structure whose transition energetics have een adequately assessed to date. We consider each transition ype alone, then competitions among them.\nquilibrium distributions o examine how topological domains sample their accessible onformations we consider a population of identical topoisoers. These are ccDNA domains, all of which have the same ase sequence and superhelicity, and are in the same envionment. Each domain in this population can be in any of he many conformational states consistent with its superhelicty. The collection of possible states is the same for every doain in this population because they all have the same linking umber. In the models developed here each possible state is characerized by the B-form and alternate structures that are present, ow these structures are deformed, and how the residual suerhelicity \u03b1r is distributed. Individual topoisomers are driven rom state to state by thermal buffeting. Alternate structures ay be created or disappear, or change their lengths or move\nbout. The secondary structures present may deform; writhe ay exchange with twist. So at any given moment the populaion as a whole will be distributed among all its possible states, ith some states more frequently occupied than others. If left to itself this population will settle into an equilibrium istribution in which states are occupied according to their nergies, with lower energy states ( exponentially ) more popuated than higher energy states. To be precise, suppose s is any articular state whose ( free ) energy is G ( s ) . At equilibrium the robability p ( s ) of a domain being in state s decreases expoentially as its energy increases:\np(s ) = e \u2212G (s ) /RT\nZ . ( 7 )\nhe proportionality factor Z is the partition function of the ystem, which is the sum of the numerator exponential terms\nover all states s . If s 1 and s 2 are two states, then the ratio of their occupancies at equilibrium is\np(s 2 ) p(s 1 ) = e \u2212 G/RT , ( 8 )\nwhere G = G ( s 2 ) \u2212 G ( s 1 ) is the energy difference between them. That is, at equilibrium individual lower energy states are exponentially more populated than are individual higher energy states. But caution is required here. There often are many more high energy states than low energy states. So although an individual state may be unlikely to occur because its energy G ( s ) is high, when considered in aggregate the high energy states still may have a significant cumulative effect.\nTo determine the equilibrium distribution of a population of identical topoisomers one must identify its possible states, assign a free energy to each, and calculate the state probabilities according to Eq. ( 7 ) . In a few simple cases this calculation can be done exactly; in most, approximations are required ( 33 , 34 , 37 ) .\nFrom the equilibrium distribution one can calculate population average values for any parameters of interest. The equilibrium average of a parameter F whose value in state s is F ( s ) is given by\nF\u0304 = \u2211\ns\nF ( s ) p( s ) , ( 9 )\nwhere the sum is taken over all accessible states. In this way one can calculate equilibrium average values for many quantities of interest. These include probabilities of transitions of various types for each base pair in a domain, lengths and numbers of transformed regions, residual superhelicities, energies, etc. By calculating equilibrium distributions at different superhelix densities one can examine how the equilibrium values of quantities of interest change with superhelicity.\nConformational states and their energies Consider a ccDNA topoisomer containing N base pairs at superhelicity \u03b1. To specify a conformational state of this domain one must first assign a secondary structure - hence a helicity, a rate of twisting - to each base pair. From this one can determine the total change of twist T that occurs in going from the B-form structure to whatever alternate structures are present in this state. Inserting this value into Eq. ( 4 ) determines the residual superhelicity \u03b1r that the domain still experiences. ( Here, it is assumed that W = 0. ) If energies can be assigned both to \u03b1r and to transitions from B-form to each of the alternate structures that the sequence permits, then these can be used in Eqs. ( 7 ) \u2013( 9 ) to construct equilibrium models of superhelical transitions to these non-B DNA conformations in this topoisomer.\nConsider a state in which there are k runs ( i.e. sets of consecutive base pairs ) of non-B structure, with all other base pairs in B-form. These runs can have any types of alternate structures, although all base pairs within a run must have the same structure type. Suppose the i -th run has length n i \u2265 1. The free energy G i required to transform the n i base pairs in run i from B-form to its alternate structure has two components:\nG i = a i + n i \u2211\nj=1 b i j . ( 10 )\nHere, b ij is the transition energy , the free energy needed to transform base pair j of run i from B-form to whatever\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nalternate structure this run has. Its value will depend on the alternate structure type, local base sequence, and environmental conditions. Regions where b ij is smaller require less energy to transition, hence ( by Eq. 8 ) will be exponentially favored over equally long regions where b ij is larger. Transition energy values have been determined for some types of alternate structures, but not for all.\nThe term a i in Eq. ( 10 ) is the nucleation energy , the free energy needed to initiate the transition of run i from B-form to its alternate structure. Equivalently, a i can be viewed as the free energy required to create the two junctions between the surrounding B-DNA and this alternate structure. Often this energy is quite high ( \u226510 kcal / mol ) as junction regions can be both disordered and strained, and may span several base pairs. The fact that nucleation energies tend to be large has two important consequences.\nFirst, when the dominant factor favoring a transition is the superhelical relaxation it affords, a domain must surpass a threshold of negative superhelicity before it starts to form this alternate structure at equilibrium. This behavior, which is examined below, occurs primarily because substantial superhelical relaxation energy is needed to overcome this nucleation energy barrier. As the superhelicity of a domain surpasses this threshold, its equilibrium distribution changes from being largely composed of entirely B-form molecules to being dominated by states having a single run of alternate structure. This run need not be of the same type nor occur at the same position in all molecules in the equilibrium distribution. Instead, approximately isoenergetic sites in a domain may compete for occupancy. The threshold unconstrained superhelicity needed for onset of transition will depend on the lengths and types of runs that initiate, their nucleation and transition energies, and the amounts of superhelical relief they provide.\nSecond, because starting an additional run of alternate structure requires paying another increment of nucleation energy, the low energy states that dominate equilibrium distributions will have few runs of alternate structure. Both of these effects hold true for all transition types whose nucleation energies have been measured.\nNext we determine the total change of twist that arises when regions of B-DNA are transformed into the runs of alternate structure that are present in our state. We first determine the changes of twist that occur in transitions between the unstressed forms of the secondary structures involved. Then we consider how runs of flexible alternate structures may themselves torsionally deform.\nDenote by t B the ( average ) unstressed helicity of B-form DNA [ t B \u2248 1 / 10.5 turns / bp], and by t i the ( average ) unstressed helicity of the alternate structure in run i . Both are measured in ( right-handed ) turns per base pair. Then the change of twist that occurs in transforming the n i base pairs in run i from B-form to its alternate structure is\nT i = n i (t i \u2212 t B ) , ( 11 ) and the total change of unstressed twist that occurs due to transitions to all the non-B secondary structures that are present in this state is\nT = k \u2211\ni =1 T i . ( 12 )\nNext, consider a run of alternate structure that contains one or more single DNA strands. Examples include strand sepa-\nrated DNA, slip structures, quadruplexes and R-loops. Suppose this run has torques imposed on its ends by the unconstrained superhelicity it experiences. Because single stranded DNA is highly flexible, this torque may wind single strand ( s ) about their complement ( s ) , hence also about the molecular central axis curve C ( 19 ) . This wrapping changes the local twist, which both absorbs additional superhelicity and requires free energy. Suppose the alternate structure in run i is twisted away from its unstressed conformation at an average rate of \u03c4i radians per base ( or base pair ) . Then the total twist imparted to this run is n i \u03c4i / 2 \u03c0 turns. The energy associated with this deformation is modeled as a Hooke \u2032 s law quadratic,\nG \u03c4,i = 1 2 C i n i \u03c4 2 i , ( 13 )\nwhere C i is the torsional stiffness resisting this rotation. C i can have different values for different types of alternate structures.\nWhen all terms involving energetics and structure are collected together, the overall model is this: A state is determined by specifying which base pairs are in what secondary structures, and how those secondary structures are torsionally deformed. In a domain whose superhelicity is \u03b1, the residual superhelicity that remains after these changes of twist are accounted for is:\n\u03b1r = \u03b1 \u2212 ( T + k \u2211 i =1 n i \u03c4i 2 \u03c0 ) , ( 14 )\nand the free energy of this state is:\nG (s ) = q\u03b1 2 r\n2 N + k \u2211 i =1 (1 2 C i n i \u03c4 2 i + a i + n i \u2211 j=1 b i j ) . ( 15 )\nInserting these expressions into Eq. ( 7 ) allows equilibrium distributions to be determined, from which average values of parameters of interest can be calculated."

This transient event, called ( single base ) DNA breathing , is thought to occur rarely and briefly ( 38 ) . Breathing moves the participating base into a more aqueous environment, which is energetically unfavorable. Thus, there is a ( free ) energy required for breathing, which we call g b . This makes it expensive to enter the breathing state, and attractive to leave it.\nAt any time it is estimated that a random base in an unstressed DNA has probability p b \u2248 10 \u22126 of being in the breathing state ( 38 ) . This probability may depend on which base pair one chooses, what its neighbors are, and which base in the pair is breathing, but these dependencies are not fully known as yet. Here, we consider one particular base pair, the one at position x , and one specific base within that pair. We assume: ( i ) that breathing of this base is at equilibrium, and ( ii ) in an unstressed DNA segment the probability of this particular base breathing is p b , which may take different values for bases at different positions.\nThe simplest model of this situation has two states, B-form ( B ) , and breathing ( b ) . Each state has an overall free energy, G B in state B and G b in state b . These total energies may be different in topologically constrained and unconstrained molecules. According to Eq.

Because these are the only states available, p b + p B 1. In an unconstrained molecule we may take the B-form as he ground state, so we have G B = 0, and G b = g b , the addiional free energy needed for breathing. We may determine an ffective value for g b from an experimentally measured probbility p b of breathing by solving Eq. ( 16 ) for the energy diference G . If p b = 10 \u22126 , then g b = 8.5 kcal / mol. In a topological domain, superhelical relaxation also could ontribute to the total energy of breathing. To estimate the xtent to which superhelicity may affect this equilibrium we egard breathing as relaxing half the helicity of a B-form base air, or 1 / 21 turns. Further, the single stranded backbone of he breathing base is flexible, so we model it as being able to wist and thereby absorb more superhelicity. For the purposes f this model we assume that this twisting is fast enough to quilibrate during the lifetime of the breathing state. In this ase the total free energy G b associated to breathing becomes 33 ) : G b = g b + 2 \u03c02 Cq (4 \u03c02 CN + q ) ( \u03b1 + 1 21 )2 , ( 17 ) hile the free energy of the B-form state is: G B = q\u03b1 2 2 N .

The ratio p b ( \u03b1) / p b ( 0 ) is the fractional change of the equilib-\nium breathing probability at superhelicity \u03b1, relative to that n a relaxed domain ( \u03b1 = 0 ) . Figure 1 graphs this calculated atio as a function of superhelix density for a domain of length = 2100 bp ( so its relaxed linking number is L 0 = 200 turns ) . n this model a substantial increase in the single base breathing robability occurs due to negative superhelicity. The experimental parameter p b is the fraction of time a base s breathing in an otherwise identical, topologically uncontrained DNA segment at equilibrium. Its value is central to his model, but has not been fully characterized. Calculations n which p b is given a range of values show that enrichment urves close to the one depicted in Figure 1 occur in all cases. his result suggests that the extent of breathing happening in\na region, if it could be accurately measured, might be used as a probe to assess the local unconstrained superhelix density that region experiences."

            "text": "Complete calculations of equilibrium distributions may not be feasible when large numbers of states are involved. As an example, consider a duplex domain of length N bp that is susceptible to only one type of transition, strand separation. Because every base pair can either separate or not, there will be 2 N possible states of secondary structure for this domain, excluding mispairings. If N > 275 then 2 N exceeds the number of nucleons ( protons + neutrons ) in the observable universe. In practice, superhelicity can constrain much longer domains than this, numerous other types of transitions also are possible, and states with many types of mispairings can occur. So the number of states available to a biologically more realistic domain can be combinatorially much larger than even this huge number.\nAn alternate structure whose transition energy b has the same value for all base pairs is said to be homopolymeric . For homopolymeric transitions complete calculations that include all states can be performed ( 33 ) . But if the transition energy varies with base sequence, as commonly occurs, one usually must use approximate methods that only include some states.\nThe most developed approach first determines the lowest energy state of the domain ( 33 ,34 ) . Then it sets an energy threshold and finds all states whose energies exceed this lowest value by less than the threshold amount. One can calculate an upper bound on the error introduced by disregarding states whose energies are above the threshold, and set the threshold to make this bound as small as one wishes ( 33 ) . In practice one often can achieve sufficient accuracy ( four to five significant figures ) by setting the threshold at 10\u201312 kcal / mol above the minimum. Calculations that use thresholds in this range to analyze 5 kb domains under physiological conditions and superhelix densities are computationally tractable, but can include hundreds of millions of states, or more.\nThis strategy can be applied to any types of alternate structures, provided only that their unstressed helicities and energy parameter values ( a , b , C ) are known. The SIST ( Superhelically Induced Structural Transitions ) program ( 39 ,40 ) uses this approach to analyze superhelical strand separation, B\u2013Z transitions and cruciform extrusions, as well as competitions among them. ( SIST is available for download from bitbucket.org . SIST and its use are described more fully below. )\nTransitions in relaxed vs nicked domains In the previous sections we considered how negative superhelicity can drive structural transitions. Now we consider how being relaxed affects a domain \u2032 s behavior. Here we compare the equilibrium transition behavior of a nicked circular DNA ( ncDNA ) to that of an otherwise identical relaxed ccDNA. The only difference between these two molecules is that one of the strands in the ncDNA has been cut, creating two free ends, whereas both strands in the relaxed ccDNA remain covalently continuous.\nThe free ends of the nicked strand in an ncDNA can rotate in different directions around its local molecular central axis. Twisting deformations can be relaxed by this rotation. And writhe can convert to twist, which rotation at the nick then can relax. In this way a ncDNA can dissipate whatever torsional or\nA\nB\nC\nFigure 2.

So its superhelicity \u03b1 = L \u2212 L 0 \u2248 0 is fixed, and its writhe and twist are topologically coupled according to Lebowitz \u2032 s law. Any change at one site that affects either writhe or twist must be balanced by compensating changes elsewhere. When a transition occurs in a relaxed ccDNA, by Eq. ( 4 ) one has \u03b1 = 0 = T + \u03b1r . If the transition untwists the DNA relative to the B-form ( i.e. if T < 0 ) then positive residual superhelicity must be generated to compensate. Because imposing positive superhelicity is energetically unfavorable, transitions will be inhibited in relaxed ccDNAs relative to otherwise identical ncDNAs. This effect has been observed in the initiation of R-loops ( 41 ) .\nSuperhelical transitions to specific non-B DNA structures Here simple theoretical models are developed to examine the basic properties of three types of superhelical transitions\u2014 strand separations ( 42 ) , BZ transitions ( 43 ) and cruciform extrusions ( 44 ) \u2014and of competitions among them ( 45 ) .

            "text": "In this conformation B-form base pairing is disrupted in a local region, so the two strands become separated there. If the balance of the domain is relaxed so no net torques are exerted on the ends of the unpaired run, at equilibrium its strands should form random coils having zero average interstrand twist. But any unconstrained superhelicity that remains will exert torques that twist the unpaired strands about each other, hence also about the molecular central axis curve. Because single DNA strands are highly flexible [persistence length \u2248 6 bases versus \u2248 150 bp for the B-form ( 46 ) ], relatively small torques can cause substantial twisting in unpaired regions. In this way additional superhelicity can be absorbed at a small incremental cost in free energy ( 33 ) . Enthalpies and entropies associated with this deformation have both been evaluated ( 11 ,12 ) .\nThe transition energy b S required to separate a base pair depends on its identity and the identities of its neighbors ( 47 ) . On average, A+T-rich sequences have lower strand separation energies and lower melting temperatures than do G+Crich sequences, the difference being about 1 kcal / mol bp at room temperature. Transition temperatures and enthalpies have been measured, so the temperature dependence of strand separation can be modeled ( 48 ,49 ) . And the ionic strength dependence of the enthalpy of transition is known ( 50 ) .\nAll organisms except thermophiles live at temperatures well below that required for thermal melting of any B-form DNA sequence. So their genomic DNAs, if unconstrained, would be entirely B-form. But negative superhelicity can drive strand separations, even at temperatures well below those needed for thermal melting. Because the nucleation energy for this transition is large ( a S = 10.8 kcal / mol ) and essentially independent of temperature ( 11 ,51 ) , states with small numbers of runs of\nseparation will be highly favored, with those runs occurring in the A+T-richest regions of the domain. At physiological negative superhelix densities in kilobase scale domains the equilibrium distribution will be dominated either by the untransformed state or by states in which one or at most a few runs of separation occur . However , these runs can be distributed among many A+T-rich regions, should the domain contain them.\nWe illustrate the basic properties of superhelical strand separation with sample calculations of equilibrium distributions for simple model systems. First, consider a 2100 bp domain that contains a single A+T-rich region of 100 bp, with the rest of the sequence being 50% A+T. Figure 2 A shows the average number n\u0304 (\u03c3 ) of separated base pairs in this domain at equilibrium as a function of superhelix density when the susceptible 100 bp region is either 60%, 70% or 80% A+T. One sees that substantial negative superhelicity is required to initiate transition in all cases, the exact amount depending on the A+T-richness of the susceptible site. Onset of this transition involves both the formation of two junctions between B-form and separated DNA, and the separation of all the base pairs in the open region. Enough base pairs must open at onset so that the superhelical relief they afford can pay both their transition energy costs and the cost of nucleation. Sequences with higher\nA c n b l c\nl i a b d r a o b i s A l\ns s m b n d t ( t s\ni r a w h W r F s e A A r 1 w s h\nT o o A a d b o l l s t i\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\n+T content have smaller transition energies, hence their total ost is less. This is why separation can initiate at less extreme egative superhelicities in more A+T-rich regions. However, ecause the nucleation energy is large, the threshold superheix density at which separation initiates is substantial in all ases.\nTransitions whose b j energies are positive do not fully reax all the superhelicity in their domains at equilibrium. This s shown for strand separation in Figure 2 B, which plots the verage residual superhelicity \u03b1\u0304r (\u03c3 ) in the equilibrium distriution as a function of superhelix density for the same three omains as were analyzed in Figure 2 A. Extending an existing un of separation requires paying the transition energy cost for ll the additional base pairs that open, which in this model can nly be done by additional superhelical relaxation. For this to e possible, there must be residual superhelicity to relax. This s why, after this transition has initiated, substantial uncontrained superhelicity remains. But sequences that are more +T-rich have lower average transition energies, so they need ess unconstrained superhelicity to extend. As \u03c3 decreases through the threshold for the onset of eparation, the length of the open region does not increase moothly away from zero. Instead the equilibrium jumps sigoidally from being dominated by the fully B-form state to eing dominated by one run states that have a substantial umber of open base pairs. This is shown in Figure 2 C, which epicts the distribution of open run lengths at equilibrium for he 2100 bp domain with a 100 bp, 80% A+T susceptible site the black curves in Figures 2 A and 2 B ) . Results are shown at hree superhelix densities, \u03c3 = \u20130.05, \u20130.055 and \u20130.06 that pan the values where separation initiates.\nThe residual superhelicity that remains after opening has nitiated applies untwisting torques to the ends of the sepaated region ( s ) . In response, the unpaired strands may rotate bout the molecular axis curve C in a left handed sense ( i.e. ith helicity \u03c4 < 0 ) . This relieves additional negative superelicity, making \u03b1r more relaxed than it otherwise would be. hen \u03b1r and \u03c4 equilibrate within a single domain they are elated by \u03b1r q = 2 \u03c0CN \u03c4 ( 33 ) . For the domains analyzed in igure 2 A and B, at superhelicities beyond the onset of tranition the average helicity \u03c4\u0304 of the open region is constant at quilibrium, independent of \u03c3, with a value depending on the +T-richness of the region involved. When this region is 80% +T, \u03c4\u0304 = \u22120 . 192 rad / bp ( \u201311 \u25e6/ bp ) ; at 70% A+T \u03c4\u0304 = \u22120 . 227 ad / bp ( \u201313 \u25e6/ bp ) , and at 60% A+T \u03c4\u0304 = \u22120 . 261 rad / bp ( \u2013 5 \u25e6/ bp ) . Because of this effect, the total untwisting that occurs hen base pairs separate in a negatively superhelical domain ubstantially exceeds what they would provide if separation appened in a topologically unconstrained region. Superhelically driven transitions are context dependent.\nhe transition behavior of a particular sequence depends not nly on its own properties and on superhelix density, but also n the attributes of the rest of the domain in which it resides. s a first example, Figure 3 plots the transition behavior of n 80% A+T-rich 100 bp segment when placed in domains of ifferent lengths, each of which is 50% A+T elsewhere. The ase sequences of both the separating region and the balance f the domain are the same in every case; only the domain ength changes. Yet the transition behavior also changes. In onger domains the onset of transition occurs at less negative uperhelix densities. The initial transition moves sigmoidally o states having larger average separation lengths n\u0304 , and openng extends more rapidly as \u03c3 decreases thereafter. Similar\nlength dependent behaviors can occur with other transition types.\nEven at high negative superhelicities the lowest energy state of a 5 kb domain usually will have a single run of separation. Only infrequently does one encounter a genomic sequence of this length whose lowest energy state has two open runs. To see why, consider a low energy state with one run of separation. For there to be a two run state with the same energy cost and the same number of separated base pairs ( i.e. level of relaxation ) there must be two runs somewhere in the domain that together contain ten more A \u00b7T base pairs, hence ten fewer G \u00b7C base pairs, than this already A+T-rich single run. This change makes the total transition energy \u224810 kcal / mol smaller in the two run state than in the one run state. This amount is needed to offset the extra nucleation energy required to open the second run. If the single run is the most favored one in the domain to separate, such a pair is unlikely to occur. For example, if this single run is 50 bp long, it infrequently happens that a kilobase scale DNA sequence contains a pair of runs totaling 50 bp that together have at least 10 more A \u00b7T base pairs than does this single A+T-richest run.\nLarge amounts of positive superhelicity also can drive strand separation ( 42 ,52 ) . Because single DNA strands are much more flexible than is the B-form duplex, it can be less costly for an A+T-rich region in a positively superhelical domain to open and massively over-twist than for the entire domain to remain in B-form.\nSuperhelical strand separation was first suggested as a possibility by Lebowitz, and conclusively shown to occur by Kowalski ( 3 , 53 , 54 ) . Experimentally, strand separations have been detected by sensitivity to single strand-specific endonucleases and by differential reactivity with small molecules such as OsO 4 or KMnO 4 . These reagents react with portions of bases that would be less accessible if they were paired. Nuclease sensitivity is a more limited probe than either chemical reactivity or ligand binding for investigating superhelical transitions and their competitions because the first cut a nuclease makes removes the topological constraint that stabilizes the alternate structures being probed. So at most one cut per domain can be expected.\nSuperhelically induced duplex destabilization ( SIDD ) Strand separation has long been known to be biologically important because transcription and replication both require base unpairing to initiate. As these processes are highly regulated in vivo , so also must be the strand separations they require. Many mechanisms contribute to this regulation, both\nto facilitate opening at the times, sites and frequencies needed, and to prevent initiations elsewhere, or in other, perhaps misregulated, ways. Superhelicity should not be expected to drive duplex openings alone, without interacting with these other mechanisms.\nSuperhelical duplex destabilization need not result in full strand separations to have an effect. Partial destabilizations also can occur and may have regulatory consequences. If superhelicity diminishes the energy needed for another process to open a site, then introducing superhelicity could up-regulate that process.\nTo model destabilization one must assess the B-form stability at each position in a superhelical domain ( 55 ) . This can be done for strand separation by calculating two average values from the equilibrium distribution. First, find the average value G\u0304 of the ( total ) free energy for all the states in that distribution. Next, for each base pair in the domain ( such as the one at position x ) consider the subset of states in which that base pair is separated ( i.e. not in B-form ) , and calculate the equilibrium average value G\u0304 (x ) of the energies of those states. Then take the difference:\nG (x ) = G\u0304 (x ) \u2212 G\u0304 . ( 19 ) G ( x ) may be used as a measure of the relative stability of base pair x in a domain whose superhelicity is \u03b1. Base pairs for which G ( x ) is high remain stable. States in which G ( x ) is diminished but not zero are fractionally destabilized. If G ( x ) is bigger than a few kcal / mol in a region, the probability of that region opening at equilibrium will be small. But it still may be significantly destabilized, which could facilitate opening by another process. As G ( x ) \u2192 0 the opening probability rises. When G ( x ) < 0 the equilibrium distribution will be dominated by states in which base pair x is open. Values of G ( x ) will vary with base sequence and superhelicity."

This transition is inhibited ( i.e. has higher transition energies ) at lower temperatures and higher ionic strengths, and facilitated at higher temperatures and lower ionic strengths.\nWe have seen that negative superhelicity can drive strand separation at temperatures well below the transition ( i.e. thermal melting ) temperature of the DNA region involved. This suggests the mirror question: Can positive superhelicity hold DNA in a B-form duplex at temperatures above its melting temperature? A theoretical analysis of this situation concluded that positive superhelicity indeed could do this, but only up to a limiting temperature ( 56 ) . Beyond that limit, which was estimated to be approximately 30 o C above the melting temperature, no amount of positive superhelicity would hold the DNA in B-form ( that is, prevent it from melting ) . This suggests a possible purpose for the positively supercoiling gyrases that occur in thermophilic organisms."

            "text": "The Z-form of DNA is a left-handed helical duplex with a dimeric repeat unit and unstressed helicity -1 / 12 turn / bp ( 21 ) . After its discovery, negative superhelicity was quickly predicted ( 43 ) , then shown ( 57 ,58 ) , to drive transitions to ZDNA. The energetics of this transition are known ( 59\u201363 ) , so equilibrium distributions can be calculated ( 64 ) .\nThe BZ transition has a strong preference for sequences in which purines and pyrimidines alternate. The lowest dimeric transition energy, 0.7 kcal / mol, occurs for either the dimer dCdG in the 5 \u2032 -anti 3 \u2032 -syn ( AS ) Z configuration or dGdC in 5 \u2032 -syn 3 \u2032 -anti ( SA ) . This is substantially smaller than the BZ transition energies needed for any other dimers. So ( dCdG ) n and ( dGdC ) n runs, if present, will be strongly favored over all other sequences to transition to Z-DNA. Sites susceptible to the BZ transition in genomic DNA tend to be short, rarely exceeding 6 or 7 dimers in length, and composed primarily of dCdGs ( or dGdCs ) , possibly with a slight admixture of less favored alternating YU \u2032 s or UY \u2032 s, all with the same anti / syn directionality. The BZ transition is the only type known to become more favored at higher ionic strengths. The nucleation energy for this transition has been measured to be 10.0 kcal / mol. ( 62 ) .\nUnder physiological conditions both the nucleation and minimum transition energies for BZ transitions are comparable to those for strand separation, but the levels of superhelical relaxation they provide are different. Each dimer that transforms to Z-DNA changes the twist by -130 o , more than a third of a turn. The corresponding figure for superhelical strand separation is slightly less than \u2013100 \u25e6 ( i.e. \u201350 \u25e6 per bp. This value includes the twisting of unpaired strands due to residual superhelicity ) . Moreover, the two BZ junctions each contain about four disrupted base pairs as detected by KMnO 4 reactivity ( 59 ) . Ascribing half the average helicity change in going from B to Z to these disordered pairs gives an estimated additional unwinding of \u20130.7 turns per junction pair. So the BZ transition provides substantially more relaxation per dimer than does strand separation. This makes it energetically favored to occur at less extreme superhelix densities in otherwise comparable situations.\nFirst we analyze a hypothetical 2100 bp domain containing\na single ( dCdG ) n run. This is the only site in the domain that is\nsusceptible to any type of transition. Figure 4 shows the equi-\nlibrium average number of Z-form base pairs that occur at\nthis site as a function of superhelix density for various values\nof the dimer number n . Transition happens earlier at longer\nsites, and in all cases the equilibrium distribution moves sigmoidally from being dominated by the untransformed state to being dominated by the fully transformed state. Comparison with Figure 2 A shows that, in domains of the same length the BZ transition occurs before ( i.e. at less extreme negative superhelicities than ) strand separation at equilibrium. ( Note that this happens even though the Z-susceptible region is much shorter than the A+T-rich, easily melted sites of Figure 2 A, so the maximum amount of relaxation it can provide is less. ) As with strand separation, the BZ transition also occurs at less\ne b\ns t w s u f c i p l t\nv w b r p\ns u s fi m d o B a p\np t c h p b\nC A D i\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nxtreme superhelix densities in longer domains, other things eing equal. As Z-susceptible sites tend to be short, sufficient residual uperhelicity may remain after a first transition has occurred o drive other transitions elsewhere. To examine this situation e consider a 2100 bp domain containing two Z-susceptible ites, one of length 8 bp and the other of length 16 bp. Figre 5 shows the equilibrium probability p ( \u03c3) of each site transorming to Z-DNA as a function of superhelix density for two ases. In Figure 5 A both sites are composed of dCdG dimers n AS, each of which has transition energy b Z = 0.7 kcal / mol er dimer. In Figure 5 B the shorter site is unchanged, while the onger site is made of dCdA dimers in AS, which have transiion energy b Z = 1.3 kcal / mol per dimer. If the value of b Z at the long site is less than or equal to its alue at the short site, as happens in Figure 5 A, the longer site ill transform first ( i.e. at less extreme superhelix densities ) ecause it can absorb more superhelicity, hence provide more elaxation. Once that transition is complete, if sufficient suerhelicity remains the short site also will transform. But if the dimers in the long site have higher average tranition energies than those in the short site, as happens in Figre 5 B, more complex behaviors become possible. The long ite now is less competitive, so the short site may transform rst. But being short, its transformation cannot relieve as uch superhelicity as can the long site. So as the superhelix ensity becomes more negative the balance tips back in favor f the long site, while the short site partially reverts back to -form. Then, at superhelix densities \u03c3 \u2264 \u22120.058 in the exmple shown, the short site also transforms with increasing robability until both sites are fully transformed. This result illustrates how negative superhelicity can cou-\nle transition behaviors at different, possibly remote posiions within topological domains. It also shows how sequence hanges at one susceptible site can alter the equilibrium beaviors of other sites. Several biologically relevant examles of such long range topological interactions are provided elow.\nruciforms n inverted repeat ( IR ) consists of two copies of a duplex NA sequence, oppositely oriented and located in close proxmity. In this arrangement each strand contains reverse com-\nplement copies of the repeat sequence, so if the strands separate each can fold back and base pair with itself. The resulting cruciform consists of two B-form hairpin arms, each constructed from a single strand of DNA. At the distal end of each arm is a loop comprised of unpaired bases from the region between the repeat copies. These two intra strand cruciform arms are connected to the inter strand duplex by a Holliday junction.\nConsider a perfect IR, each copy of which consists of the identical sequence of N C base pairs, with the copies separated by N L \u2265 4 base pairs. The cruciform formed by this sequence can have arms of any length n a in the range 1 \u2264 n a \u2264 N C . The loops at the ends of the arms will each contain N L unpaired bases. Because maximal base pairing is energetically favored, in this model both arms have the same length n a , the loops have equal, minimal lengths, and the junction contains no unpaired bases.\nTo initiate a cruciform, intrastrand base pairing starts at the loop end of each arm and extends for n a base pairs. If this does not include the entire IR, any remaining base pairs will be in the interstrand duplex. If the inverted repeat symmetry is not perfect so one copy contains insertions, deletions or symmetry violations relative to the other, then mispaired or unpaired bases must be incorporated into each cruciform arm as they grow long enough to include their corresponding imperfections.\nThe structural attributes of cruciforms confer unique properties on their transition energetics. Whereas strand separation and BZ transitions have specific initiation energies a and sequence dependent extension energies b , in cruciform extrusion the initiation energy a C varies depending on the base composition and length of the loop region. And for a perfect IR the extension energy is b C = 0. This happens because extending a perfect cruciform involves breaking interstrand base pairs and forming an equal number of identical intrastrand pairs in the two cruciform arms. As this is an approximately isoenergetic process, in this model there is no transition energy cost ascribed to extending a cruciform made from a perfect IR.\nBut there is an energy return from the relaxation of unconstrained superhelicity that extension provides. Because the two arms of a cruciform are physically separated in space, their twist rate is t C = 0. So transforming an IR from an interstrand B-form to a cruciform having arm length n a changes its twist by T C = n C ( t C \u2212 t B ) = \u2212n C / 10.5 turns. ( Here n C = 2 n a + N L is the total number of interstrand base pairs that have been disrupted to form this cruciform, and 10.5 is the average number of base pairs per turn in B-DNA ( 20 ) . ) Because cruciform extrusion decreases twist, it can be driven by negative superhelicity. This possibility was first considered by Lebowitz ( 65 ) , and proven to occur by Lilley ( 66 ) . The energetics of this transition have been determined ( 13 ) , so theoretical models can be developed ( 39 ,44 ) .\nThe basic properties of superhelical cruciform extrusion can be examined by calculating equilibria for model topoisomers, each of length N and containing an identical, perfect IR, with cruciformation at this IR being the only possible transition. States of extrusion are indexed by the arm length n a , which can take any value in the range 1 \u2264 n a \u2264 N C . The fully B-form state having no cruciform also is included. Unless otherwise stated, the loop sequence of this IR is TAAA, so N L = 4. The initiation energy for a ( perfect ) cruciform having this loop has been measured to be 17.3 kcal / mol at 37 o C, substantially larger than the initiation energies for either the\nFigure 7. The probabilities of extrusion p C ( \u03c3) of a perfect IR of length N C = 40 bp and various loop lengths are plotted as functions of the superhelix density \u03c3. Each IR is embedded in a domain of length N = 20 0 0 bps. The black curve is for N L = 4, green for N L = 6, blue for N L = 8, brown for N L = 10 and red for N L = 12.\nFigure 8.

This is reasonable, as initiating a cruciform requires forming two unpaired loop structures, two four-stranded junctions where each loop joins its arm, and one Holliday junction. First we consider the effect that the copy length N C of a perfect inverted repeat has on its extrusion. As described above, once this cruciform has initiated, its extension provides an energy benefit from superhelical relaxation without costing any additional transition energy. So once extrusion has started it will continue to completion. This can occur in either of two ways. If the IR copies are sufficiently long, partial extrusion of the cruciform may fully relax all the unconstrained superhelicity in the domain. In this case the equilibrium distribution will have average residual superhelicity \u03b1r \u2248 0. If the IR is not long enough to fully relax the domain, it will extrude its full cruciform. Now the average arm length is n\u0304 a \u2248 N C , and residual negative superhelicity may remain. Which of these two cases occurs depends on the lengths of the domain and the IR, and the level of superhelicity imposed. Figure 6 plots the equilibrium average cruciform arm lengths n\u0304 a (\u03c3 ) for perfect IRs having different copy lengths as functions of superhelix density \u03c3 in a domain of length N = 2100 bp. Shorter IRs require more extreme superhelix densities to initiate, and jump sigmoidally from being untransformed to full extrusion. This behavior occurs because, although all these IRs have the same transition energy cost, shorter IRs relax less superhelicity. So to provide enough relaxation energy to pay the initiation cost, shorter IRs must extrude at higher superhelix densities. The longest IR considered in the figure ( N C = 50 bp ) transitions sigmoidally to states of partial extrusion, then linearly extends to complete extrusion as the superhelicity becomes more extreme.\nNext we consider how loop length N L affects superhelical cruciform extrusion equilibria. Because the base pairs within the loop region must separate and remain single stranded, the energy required for their denaturation is not recovered and must be included in the initiation energy cost. Also, longer unpaired structures require more free energy to form ( 13 ) . So as the loop region between the two repeat copies becomes longer, the initiation energy increases. To overcome a larger initiation energy, more superhelical free energy is required. So IRs with longer loops will initiate extrusion at more extreme negative superhelicities. This behavior is shown in Figure 7 , where the computed probabilities of transition are graphed as functions of superhelix density for a perfect IR having copy length N C = 40 bp and various loop lengths within a 2000 bp domain.\nFinally, we examine the effect of imperfections in IR symmetry on superhelical extrusion. For this we consider a GC\nindel, a single G \u00b7C base pair that is present in one copy of the IR but not in the other. As this site becomes incorporated into a growing cruciform, one extra base enters each arm, creating two single base bulges. Free energy is required both to separate one G \u00b7C base pair that does not reform and to make this pair of extrahelical bulges. The bulge pair free energy has been measured ( 13 ) , so the total free energy required to incorporate this single indel defect into a cruciform can be estimated to be 6.8 kcal / mol.\nThe presence of even one such indel has a profound effect on the transition properties of an IR, with the nature of this effect depending on its position. If the indel is located sufficiently close to the loop region of its IR, at equilibrium its single base bulges will be incorporated into the cruciform arms as soon as extrusion becomes energetically favored. In this situation the energy required to form these bulges adds to the overall initiation energy a C of the cruciform. So the presence of an indel near the loop end of its IR is predicted to delay the onset of cruciformation to more extreme negative superhelicities, but not to affect its extension thereafter.\nThis behavior may be seen by comparing the black curve in Figure 8 ( no indel, perfect IR ) with the red curve ( G \u00b7C indel located 16 bp from the loop ) . In both cases the onset of transition involves a sigmoidal transition between unopened states and states whose cruciform arms are longer than 16 bp. The superhelix density at which this transition occurs is delayed by the presence of the indel, but once it has occurred further extrusion proceeds identically in both cases.\nThe situation reverses when the same indel is located farther from the IR \u2032 s center of symmetry. Now its bulges occur further down the cruciform arms, too far away from the loop end to be incorporated at the onset of transition.

In part ( A ) N C = 12 bp; in part ( B ) N C = 18 bp.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nhis situation, our G \u00b7C indel is relocated to a position 32 bp rom the loop end of its IR. The computed equilibrium averge arm length n\u0304 a (\u03c3 ) for this IR is shown by the blue curve in igure 8 . Now the initial transition does not go immediately o full extrusion, as it does when the IR is perfect ( the black urve ) . Instead it pauses at n a = 32, when it reaches the indel. ubstantial additional superhelicity is needed before further xtension can provide sufficient relaxation energy to pay the ost of forming these bulges and allow extrusion to run to ompletion. When an indel is remote from the loop end of its R, its presence does not change the unconstrained superhelicty at which extrusion initiates, but it does alter its subsequent xtrusion behavior.\nAs these examples suggest, for an isolated inverted repeat o extrude a cruciform in a superhelical domain it needs to ave three properties. First, it must be long enough to provide ufficient relaxation to overcome its initiation energy barrier. econd, the repeat copies must be in close proximity so its oop is small. And third, the repeat copies must be perfect or early perfect.\nhe competitive nature of superhelical transitions o this point we have only considered transitions in isolation, s though each type were the only possibility within its doain. But genomic DNA sequences commonly contain many ites that are susceptible to transitions. Indeed, the same site an be susceptible to multiple types of transitions. For exmple, ( dTdA ) n is among the energetically least expensive seuences to separate. It also can form Z-DNA, although it is an nergetically less favored dimer. And it is an inverted repeat.\nIn a negatively superhelical topological domain all ransition-susceptible sites compete, with the behavior of each ffecting all others ( 39 , 45 , 67 ) . Because each transition fracionally ( or entirely ) relaxes its domain, when it occurs it eaves a smaller amount of unconstrained superhelicity behind o drive other transitions elsewhere. In this way the occurence of any superhelical transition inhibits all others. Conersely, reversion of a transformed region back to B-form reeases the superhelicity it had constrained back into the doain, where it can facilitate other transitions elsewhere. In this ay fixing the linking number ( i.e. the topological constraint f superhelicity ) globally couples together the transition beaviors of all susceptible sites within a domain. This coupling rovides genomic DNA with rich sequence- and superhelicityependent repertoires of possible ways by which distinct reions within the same domain can interact.\nEquilibrium distributions for domains containing multiple usceptible sites will be dominated by states where the combiation of transitions that occur and the residual superhelicity hey leave behind, when taken together, have the lowest values f total free energy. As it is energetically expensive to initiate ransitions at new sites, the low energy states of a superhelial domain will have few simultaneously transformed regions. ut if a domain contains numerous transition-susceptible ites, its equilibrium distribution may include states containng many different combinations of transitions among the ost favorable of them. Consider a circular domain of length N = 2100 bp that ontains three regions, each susceptible to a different type of ransition. One is an easily melted run of 40 bp that is 80% +T. The second, ( dCdG ) 4 , is maximally susceptible to the Z transition. The third is a perfect inverted repeat with copy\nlength N C and separation distance ( i.e. loop length ) N L = 4. The rest of the domain is 50% A+T, and is regarded as being able to melt but unable to form any other alternate structures. The locations of the three susceptible sites within this uniform background do not affect the equilibrium, so long as they are separated by runs of B-DNA.\nFigure 9 shows the computed effect of changing the IR copy length from N C = 12 to N C = 18, with all other attributes held constant. As N C increases, cruciform extrusion changes from being uncompetitive with the alternatives to entirely dominating the competition. The first transition to occur is either cruciform extrusion if the IR is sufficiently long, the case in Figure 9 B, or the BZ transition otherwise ( Figure 9 A ) . After the onset of transition, complex interactions among the three sites can occur as superhelicity changes, with reversions of some transitions coupled to the occurrences of others.\nCompetitions among superhelical transitions can be exquisitely sensitive to small changes of base sequence. Even a single point mutation at a sensitive position can radically alter transition behaviors throughout a domain. This is illustrated in Figure 10 , parts A ) and B ) of which show the transition probabilities for a 2100 bp domain that contains the same Z-susceptible site and easily melted region as those in Figure 9 , together with an inverted repeat having copy length N C = 15 bp. When N L = 4, the case shown in Figure 10 A, the initial competition is between the BZ transition and cruciform extrusion, with strand separation entering only at high ( negative ) superhelicities, a regime where the greater length of the A+T-rich region gives it an advantage.\nFigure 10 B shows the transition profiles for the same domain, with the single difference that the loop length of the IR now is N L = 5 instead of 4. This adds one base to each loop, which increases the energy needed to initiate cruciformation enough to render this transition entirely uncompetitive with the others. Now initiation involves only the BZ transition. But because its susceptible region is short, this transition can relax only a small number of superhelical turns. Once it is complete, around \u03c3 = \u22120.055 in this model, the A+T-rich region starts to open, coupled to the reversion of the Z-form region back to B-form. This happens because the expense of paying initiation costs for both transitions is too high, so at this superhelix density only one or the other occurs at equilibrium.\nOnly when the separation-susceptible site is fully transformed does additional negative superhelicity again drive the transition to Z form, so both alternate structures coexist. Extrusion of the cruciform with this slightly longer loop does not play any role in this model competition at physiological superhelix densities, even though it would easily happen if it were the only possibility. ( See Figure 7 . )\nIn Figure 10 C, the domain has the same IR and separationsusceptible regions as in Figure 10 A but one C in its Zsusceptible region has been changed to a T. This increases the cost of the BZ transition enough to eliminate it from the competition. Now the cruciform extrudes first, followed when it is complete by strand separation.\nIn Figure 10 D, both of the mutations analyzed separately in Figure 10 B and C are present. This diminishes the competitiveness of both the cruciform and the Z-form, so in this situation strand separation is the only alternate structure that occurs at physiological superhelix densities.\nFigure 10 E treats the identical sequence as in Figure 10D, only now 25 bp of its A+T-rich region are regarded as being unavailable for transition. This could happen, for instance, if a molecule or complex binds to the B-form there, occluding this 25 bp portion and removing it from the competition. ( A biological example where this occurs will be provided below. ) Now the BZ transition and cruciformation together dominate the onset of competition. Only beyond \u03c3 = \u22120.06 does strand separation start to become competitive.\nThese examples show that the competitive behavior of superhelical transitions can be acutely sensitive both to the details of base sequence at susceptible sites and to the occurrence of binding events there. Single base insertions and point mutations can vastly change the competitive landscape, making any of the three transitions modeled here dominant.\nCompetitive transition behaviors also can vary with domain size. Identical susceptible sequences placed in domains having the same composition but different lengths may behave differently. This is shown in Figure 11 , which plots the probability of transition for the same three regions as were analyzed in Figure 10 A, now placed in a 4200 bp domain. ( In Figure 10 A the domain length was 2100 bp. ) In both cases, the equilibrium behaviors show qualitative similarities. The onset of transition is a competition between cruciformation and the BZ transition, and occurs near the same superhelix density in both domains. But strand separation enters the competition much earlier in the longer domain. And all three transitions proceed essentially to completion within the physiological range of superhelix densities in the longer domain, but not in the shorter one.\nThe temperature dependence of competitive transitions To assess how temperature may affect superhelical transitions one must know the enthalpies and entropies of all relevant free energies. At present this information is available only for strand separation and cruciform extrusion ( 11 ,13 ) . Here, we assess how the competition between these two transitions varies with temperature in a simple model system.\nConsider a 2100 bp ccDNA that contains one perfect in-\nverted repeat with copy length N C = 18 bp and loop length N L = 4 bp, and one separation-susceptible site that is 40 bp long and 80% A+T. ( These two susceptible sites were chosen to have equal total lengths. ) The balance of the domain is 50% A+T. Figure 12 shows the competition that occurs at equilibrium in this model plasmid at four temperatures from 25 \u25e6C ( 298 K ) to 45 \u25e6C ( 318 K ) . These transitions are seen to compete in an almost identical manner at all temperatures in this range. The only substantive difference is that they initiate at less extreme negative superhelicities at higher temperatures.\np e M a\ni\nS s T l s u t u q i w a t s e l l w c t p a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nThe examples presented in this section illustrate how simle equilibrium models can be used to investigate basic proprties of competitive superhelical conformational transitions. any interesting questions can be addressed by constructing nd analyzing such models. We now turn to situations of more specific biological nterest. uperhelical transitions in genomic DNA equences he SIST program ( 39 ,40 ) may be used to calculate superhe-\nical equilibria of genomic DNA sequences in which strand eparation, BZ transitions, and cruciformation compete. The ser inputs the sequence of the domain to be analyzed and he level of superhelicity to be imposed upon it. SIST then ses the IRFinder algorithm ( 68 ) to identify all sites in the seuence with significant inverted repeat symmetry ( IRs ) . This ncludes both perfect and imperfect repeats. Only those IRs hose loops are short enough to be potentially competitive re retained. Then transition energies for both strand separaion and BZ transition are assigned to every base pair in the equence, and for cruciformation to every extruded state of ach inverted repeat. This information is analyzed to find the owest energy state available to the domain at the specified evel of superhelicity. An energy cutoff is set, and all states hose total energies exceed this lowest value by less than the utoff amount are found. The equilibrium distribution among hose states is determined, and ensemble average values of all arameters of interest are computed. SIST may be used to anlyze sequences of lengths up to 10 000 bp. Longer sequences\ncan be subdivided into overlapping pieces which may be analyzed individually and the results combined ( 69 ) .\nPredicted transition susceptibilities in eukaryotes During transcription a bow wave of over-twist is pushed ahead of the RNAP complex, and a wake of under-twist is left behind. This repartitions whatever superhelicity is present in the domain being transcribed. In the absence of transcriptional activity, eukaryotic domains remain largely relaxed.\nAs all the transitions considered here can be facilitated by negative superhelicity, the regions upstream from ( i.e. 5 \u2032 to ) transcription start sites ( TSSs ) suggest themselves as fruitful places to search for potential topologically tuned regulatory elements. First introns, which when present are located 3 \u2032 to the TSS, also can have regulatory elements embedded within them. A transition-susceptible site within an intron would remain stably B-form while it was in the downstream, overtwisted region ahead of an RNAP. But after a transcription complex has passed through the site, it finds itself in the upstream region behind the RNAP, where it could become destabilized by the untwisting torques it now experiences. Such a site, by undergoing a superhelically induced structural transition, could both sense and communicate to other upstream regions the fact that the current round of transcription has passed this putative checkpoint.\nTo investigate superhelical transition susceptibilities in eukaryotes, a dataset of mouse genomic sequences was created. All annotated transcription start sites in the contemporary release of the murine genome were found, and genes that had one dominant TSS were identified. The database consisted of 5 kb sequences, each centered on one of these TSSs and oriented so transcription proceeds to the right. There were 12841 such sequences in the release of the murine genome available at the time ( 39 ) .\nEach 5 kb sequence in this database was analyzed using SIST at T = 310 K and superhelix density \u03c3 = \u22120.06. A sequence was identified as experiencing a particular type of transition whenever the computed equilibrium probability of that transition occurring somewhere within it exceeded 0.5. By this criterion, every sequence in the database had one or more regions of altered structure at this superhelicity. 69% of the sequences contained one or more sites of strand separation, while 59% contained one or more sites of BZ transition. Interestingly, sites of BZ transition were concentrated just upstream of TSSs, while sites of strand separation were symmetrically depleted in the proximal regions on both sides of TSSs ( 39 ) .\nIRFinder identified 19563 potentially cruciform-susceptible inverted repeats in this murine dataset. When superhelical cruciformation was analyzed in isolation, 1449 of these IRs were predicted to extrude with probability exceeding 0.5. But in the three-way competition analyzed by SIST , only 75 sequences ( 0.38% of the potentially susceptible IRs ) were predicted to extrude cruciforms. In 74 of these a single cruciform extruded, one sequence was predicted to extrude two cruciforms.\nThis result reinforces the view that only the longest, most nearly perfect IRs with minimal loop lengths will be competitive at equilibrium in genomic sequences. While such IRs may be encountered infrequently in genomic DNA, those that do occur can have important consequences. Certain chromosomal translocation breakpoint hotspots are located at the centers of dyad symmetry of long IRs of this type ( 70 ) .\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nPredicted transition susceptibilities in prokaryotes Prokaryotes ( bacteria ) manage their DNAs differently than eukaryotes. Genes are much more tightly packed in prokaryotes; there can be several in a 5 kb sequence. And they do not have introns. Sequential genes can be regulated as a single unit, an operon. Genomic regions can be used for more than one purpose. Transcription units may overlap other units or regulatory regions. The same piece of sequence can encode multiple genes, for example, each in its own reading frame. The genomic DNA in prokaryotes is not periodically immobilized into nucleosomes, as it is in eukaryotes. But prokaryotes do have architectural proteins. In E. coli these include FIS, IHF and HU.\nThose prokaryotes that produce gyrases can maintain topological domains in negatively superhelical basal states, upon which transcription and other processes act. These actions may either change the linking numbers of domains, or repartition linking within them. Basal levels of superhelicity are set by the balance between TOPO1 and gyrase activities. Because gyrase is an ATPase while TOPO1s are not, basal superhelicity will vary according to the relative abundances of these enzymes, and the ATP+ADP energy charge of the cell.\nE. coli uses changes of superhelicity to regulate transitions between its stationary and growth states ( 24 ) . Under nutrientpoor conditions it abides in stationary phase, in which the energy charge is relatively small. In consequence gyrase activity is diminished, so domains are maintained closer to their relaxed states. When the organism moves to a more nutrient-rich environment it transitions to growth phase. The energy charge of the cell increases, which up-regulates gyrase activity, driving domains to more negative superhelix densities. Transitions between stationary and growth phases involve substantial alterations of the organism \u2032 s transcriptional program. These are modulated in part by the changes of superhelicity that occur ( 24 ) .\nTo consider what roles superhelical transitions might play in this modulation, a dataset of 4442 E. coli transcriptional regulatory regions was constructed. Each region was 5 kb long and centered on an annotated TSS, as was done above for the mouse. And the same SIST analysis was performed on this dataset ( 39 ) . Sites of predicted transition susceptibility were noted, and their correlations with genomic annotations of the sequence were assessed. Curiously, opposite patterns were found from those that were seen in the mouse. In E. coli , sites predicted to strand separate under superhelicity were enriched in the 5 \u2032 flanks of operons, while Z-forming sites were depleted. Cruciform-forming sites, while still rare, also were somewhat enriched near annotated TSSs.\nAnother study analyzed duplex destabilization in the complete E. coli genome at superhelix density \u03c3 = \u22120.06 ( 71 ) . It found a statistically highly significant positive correlation between strongly destabilized SIDD sites ( i.e. those base pairs for which G ( x ) [defined in Eq. 19] satisfies G ( x ) \u2264 2.0 kcal / mol ) , and inter-operon regions that were known or could be inferred to contain promoters. It found no such enrichment at interoperon sites that could be inferred to not contain promoters ( i.e. those between convergently transcribing operons ) , and a highly statistically significant tendency for SIDD sites to avoid coding regions. Of the 506 most strongly destabilized sites in the E. coli genome ( those where G ( x ) \u2264 0 ) , 457 occurred in the upstream flanks of genes or operons. The upstream regions of genes classified as regulators ( GenProtEC group r ) and those in COG groups K ( genes whose products function in tran-\nscriptional control ) or T ( signal transduction ) were statistically significantly enriched in these most strongly destabilized sites, while the upstream regions of RNA genes ( GenProtEC group n ) and genes of external origin ( group h ) were enriched in stable sites ( those with G ( x ) \u2265 8.0 throughout ) .\nThe complete genomes of 61 other prokaryotes then were analyzed ( 72 ) . Of these, 43 were free-living bacteria that must adapt to changing environments, while 18 were either endosymbionts or obligate parasites that live in more constant conditions. A statistically significant association between the strongest SIDD sites and upstream regions of genes functioning in transcription ( COG group K ) was observed in 38 of the 43 free living organisms, but in only 4 of the 18 that live in constant environments.\nThe E. coli genome sequence has been examined for the presence of motifs associated with various non-B DNA structures including G4 quadruplexes, cruciforms, H-DNA and slipped structures ( 73 ) . In this study susceptibilities to strand separation and to B-Z transitions were each analyzed separately ( but not in competition ) by SIST calculations ( 64 ) . The sequence-based methods used to determine potential susceptibilities to the other types of transitions did not consider whether a flagged motif was energetically favored to transform, nor how transitions might compete in superhelical domains. But they did assess the statistical significance of location-dependent associations by performing appropriate sequence randomizations. This study found the same patterns of strand separation and IR enrichment, and of Z-form depletion, in 5 \u2032 gene flanks as did the SIST and other analyses ( 39 ,71 ) . It also found enrichment of G4 and H-DNA motifs in 5 \u2032 gene flanks, and enrichment of inverted repeats in the terminal flanks of operons. Neither enrichment nor depletion of slipped structure motifs ( i.e. direct repeats ) was noted.\nSuperhelical transitions in vivo In 1987, Robert Wells and his group reported detecting ZDNA in living cells ( 74 ) . Their experiment used a plasmid containing a site known to be Z-susceptible under superhelicity in vitro . This plasmid was inserted in a strain of E. coli and its structural properties were assessed.\nMore recently, the ssDNA-Seq technique has been developed, which is capable of finding unpaired bases in vivo in complete genomes ( 75 ) . In ssDNA-Seq, potassium permanganate ( KMnO 4 ) is introduced, which oxidizes unpaired pyrimidines with a strong preference for thymines. The bases it modifies can no longer participate in pairing, so regions that were unpaired when KMnO 4 was introduced remain in that state. The cellular DNA is extracted, purified and reacted with S1, a single strand-specific endonuclease. This enzyme digests single DNA strands back to the places where they rejoin the duplex. The resulting duplex fragments are end labeled with biotin, the DNA sonicated, and the labeled pieces pulled down and sequenced. This locates the boundaries of the T-containing genomic sites that were unpaired in vivo at the time KMnO 4 was introduced.\nAlthough ssDNA-Seq only finds regions containing unpaired bases, it can be used to identify several types of alternate structures in addition to strand separations. Regions of Z-DNA are bounded on each end by multi-base pair junctions that are disrupted enough to allow Ts they contain to react. So a Z-susceptible sequence closely bounded by two KMnO 4\nr s c p p\no B m F w 1 w q w c r t r a\nw t g t o d t m\nS p C t e p c\nS I i g a o f u p s b w w\nA A s v D w f l\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\neactive sites may be inferred to have been in Z-form in vivo . In imilar fashion ssDNA-Seq can find loop regions of extruded ruciforms, unpaired strands in H-DNA and R-loops, and unaired loops within or complementary strands of G4 quadrulexes. The ssDNA-Seq technique first was used to investigate the ccurrence of unpaired regions in resting and activated mouse -cells ( 75 ) . More recently it has been applied to several mamalian cell lines, including Burkitt \u2032 s lymphoma Raji cells ( 76 ) . our types of alternate structures were identified, each of hich has a characteristic pattern of KMnO 4 sensitivity. 15 88 strand separated sites were found in activated B-cells, as ere 22 214 Z-form sites, 16 876 runs of H-DNA and 18 397 uadruplexes. Separations indicative of loops of cruciforms ere sought at centers of symmetry of inverted repeats, but the leavage patterns found were not statistically significantly eniched over background. While alternate structures were seen hroughout the genome, there was a 2-fold enrichment over andom in the 5 \u2032 flanks of genes, and a 10-fold enrichment round transcription start sites.\nThe ssDNA-Seq technique analyzes populations of cells, hich commonly are heterogeneous in their conditions and ranscriptional activities. Because its results average the sinle strand profiles of all the cells in the population, transitions hat occur only in subpopulations, or only at specific develpmental stages or times in the cell cycle, may fall below its etection threshold. At present it also cannot assess competiions among transitions. This requires methods that can detect ultiple alternate structures within single molecules.\nuperhelical transitions in specific biological rocesses alculations of superhelical transition equilibria have proven o be useful tools for investigating a variety of biological vents. Here we provide several examples involving various rocesses, both normal and pathological, in which superhelial strand separation has been implicated.\nuperhelicity and transcription initiation n some circumstances superhelicity alone can be sufficient to nitiate transcription. An example is provided by the CUP1 ene promoter of yeast ( 77 ) . CUP1 transcription was initited in negatively superhelical plasmids, even in the absence f T A T A binding protein, a T A T A box and any transcription actors. But transcription did not occur in relaxed plasmids nder identical conditions. The CUP1 initiation element was redicted by SIDD analysis to be susceptible to superhelical trand separation. Experimentally, this element was cleaved y mung bean nuclease, a single strand-specific endonuclease, hen the plasmid was negative superhelical but not when it as relaxed.\nviral replication origin region undergoing superhelical strand separation has been hown to play a role in the functioning of the Epstein-Barr irus latent cycle replication origin oriP ( 78 ) . When unrelated NA sequences were substituted for this region, those that ere susceptible to superhelical destabilization retained origin unction while those that were stable under negative superheicity were not active."

Superhelical plasmids containing repeats having different lengths were analyzed theoretically for their SIDD properties, and investigated experimentally by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , gel electrophoresis and chemical probes ( 79 ) . For short repeats, n \u2264 5, the predicted superhelical behavior was dominated by transitions elsewhere in the plasmid. But for longer repeats flanked by A+T-rich regions, negative superhelicity drove strand separation at the repeat site, as was verified experimentally. For n = 29, just above the normal range, an unpaired structure was seen by AFM, and single strands within the repeat became accessible to chemical modification. This unpaired region was shown to function as an aberrant replication origin, supporting plasmid replication in a HeLa cell extract. A model was proposed by which unscheduled replication initiated from this site leads to copy number expansion."

SIDD analysis of a selection of S / MARs has shown that they share a pattern of evenly spaced base unpairing regions ( 80 ,81 ) .

Mitotic stability can be conferred on a designed episomal vector by including in it a functional S / MAR-binding SIDD site that can attach it to the nuclear architecture ( 86 ,87 ) .\nDNA structural transitions and regulatory binding Most DNA activities are regulated in vivo by interactions with other molecules and complexes. If an interaction either requires or prefers active DNA sites having particular structures, and if some of those sites can form multiple structures, then whether the interaction occurs may depend on which structure is present. This in turn can vary with the level of superhelicity the domain experiences. As shown in the sample calculations performed above, whether a superhelically driven transition occurs at one site can both affect and be affected by, the occurrences of other alternate structures elsewhere. If a binding event serves a regulatory purpose, assisting or inhibiting some process, then the rate of its regulatory step can be coupled to the level of unconstrained superhelicity its binding site experiences, and thereby perhaps also to other binding and / or transition events occurring elsewhere in the domain. Different effects would be expected, depending on whether this binding is to the B-form or to an alternate structure. One example of each type is given.\nThe ilv P G promoter A prokaryotic example is provided by the ilv P G promoter of E. coli , which regulates transcription of the ilvGMEDA operon ( 88 ) . Expression of this operon is up-regulated by the binding of integration host factor ( IHF ) to a region within an activating sequence ( UAS1 ) that is located 90 bp upstream from the promoter start position. However, this up-regulation only occurs in negatively superhelical domains ( 89 ) . IHF binding to UAS1 has no effect on the transcription initiation rate when this promoter is in a linear or nicked circular molecule, or in a relaxed topological domain.\nSIDD analysis showed that this IHF binding site was located precisely at the most easily superhelically destabilized location in the experimental plasmid ( 90 ) . On the basis of this result, experiments were devised and performed to determine whether this site in fact did unpair under negative superhelicity, and if so, to assess the superhelix density dependence of that unpairing in the presence and absence of IHF.\nIn the absence of IHF this most easily destabilized site was found by OsO 4 binding to strand separate at superhelix densities \u03c3 \u2264 \u22120.02. But in the presence of IHF this site did not separate at any tested linking difference. IHF binding occludes\nits site, clamping it into a highly bent B-form conformation ( 30 ) . This renders it unable to separate and thereby removes it from competition. A second experiment was performed to determine what effect this IHF clamping might have on the promoter. With IHF bound so the most easily separated site was unavailable for opening, superhelical destabilization was found by KMnO 4 reactivity to be transferred to the -10 region of the promoter, facilitating open complex formation and thereby up-regulating transcription.\nExperiments were performed to determine whether it was specifically the transition properties of the region encompassing UAS1 and the ilv P G promoter that modulated the transcription initiation rate ( 91 ) . To address this question, a way was devised to alter transition susceptibilities in this region without altering its other properties. The sequence ( CG ) 13 AATT ( CG ) 22 was inserted into the experimental plasmid at a position 449 bp upstream from the TSS. This inserted sequence is susceptible to the BZ transition, which is predicted to out-compete strand separation under negative superhelicity in the experimental conditions. The complete BZ transition at this site changes the twist by T = \u221213 turns, as was verified by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. This delays the onset of strand separation at UAS1 by 13 negative superhelical turns, as was shown by OsO 4 reactivity. And the IHF bindinginduced increase in the in vitro transcription rate was found to be delayed by the same amount.\nWhereas this example involves a molecule whose binding prevents an alternate structure from forming, the next case treats a regulatory molecule that binds to an alternate structure.\nThe c-myc oncogene A eukaryotic example is provided by the human c-myc oncogene. A far upstream element ( FUSE ) located 1.5 kb 5 \u2032 to this gene \u2032 s P1 promoter has been both predicted and observed to undergo a biphasic strand separation transition in response to negative superhelicity ( 92 ) . FUSE binding protein ( FUBP ) binds to this region, but only when it is single stranded. FUBP has a repressing domain and an activating domain, each of which binds to a separate portion of the bimodally separating FUSE. In this way the FUSE element can act as a superhelically regulated switch. Its bimodal separation determines the locations and types of FUBP binding that occur, which in turn regulates transcription."

All that is required is that\nhe structural and energetic properties of each transition type ncluded in the model be known. This approach can be used to ease apart the various interacting influences that together deermine competitive transition behavior. Equilibrium calculaions also can suggest possible roles for alternate DNA strucures in biological processes, and experiments to test them. owever, in their present, preliminary forms these techniques ave significant limitations. Opportunities for improvements bound. Here we describe some of the advances that would nable more complete and potentially informative models to e constructed.\nnergetics he equilibrium models of superhelical transitions developed ere require values of three energy parameters for each of the\nncluded alternate structure types. A sequence dependent tranition energy b must be assigned to each susceptible base pair. n initiation energy a is needed and, if the alternate structure ontains one or more single strands, a torsional stiffness C for nterstrand winding must be specified. The coefficient q of the here presumed quadratic ) free energy of residual superhelicty also is required, as are the changes of helicity involved in oing from the unstressed B-form to the unstressed forms of hatever alternate structures are being modeled. At present reasonably accurate values for all these energy arameters are known only for three transition types\u2014strand eparation, BZ transitions and cruciformation. Even in these ases parameter values often were measured using various exerimental techniques applied to different plasmids under diferent conditions, so it is not always clear how compatible hey are. As an example, consider superhelical strand separaion. Its transition free energies ( values of b ) have been deterined for all neighbor pairs by thermal denaturation of short uplex oligomers ( 47\u201349 ) . The enthalpy of strand separation as measured by calorimetry at various salt concentrations 50 ) . The free energy a S needed to initiate separation and the oefficient C S governing interstrand twisting in unpaired reions were assessed by 2D gel electrophoresis and nuclease igestion ( 11 , 12 , 51 ) . The free energy of superhelicity was deermined from dye intercalation and gel electrophoresis data n different plasmids. The situation is similar for BZ transiions. All the transition free energy parameters for cruciforation at both perfect and imperfect IRs were measured in a\nsingle experiment, but only for one IR in one plasmid background ( 13 ) .\nOther transition types, such as to H-DNA triplexes or G4 quadruplexes, do not yet have enough energy information available to allow the construction of equilibrium models for them. The transition energies b R for R-loop formation are known ( 93 ) , so their superhelical transitions can be modeled by taking all other parameters to fall within reasonable ranges. This allows one to show that superhelicity can be an important, perhaps dominant, factor in R-loop formation ( 94 ) . But it is not enough to allow R-loops to be incorporated into SIST competitions at present.\nBecause of uncertainties regarding energetics, only qualitative conclusions can be drawn from current theoretical models. One may predict, for example, the directions in which competitive transition behaviors will change with sequence modifications or changes of environment or superhelicity, but not more quantitatively precise details. Equilibrium calculations such as the ones presented here have been successful at finding the sites within domains that are most susceptible to transitions of various types. These can be the ones that dominate in a specific biological process. Qualitative predictions of this sort can be quite useful, as the examples presented above show. But the utility of this approach could be improved, and better models made, if the energetics governing transitions were more fully understood.\nPlasmids can be constructed to test how single transition types behave at different superhelicities, and how different types compete. Such ccDNAs could be designed to be experimental analogues of simple theoretical models of the types constructed here. Experiments on simple plasmids can provide valuable data from which transition energetics may be determined ( 11\u201313 , 51 , 62 ) . Once the governing energetics are accurately known, experiments involving designed plasmids could be used to test alternate models. Ideally, all relevant parameters for all modeled transition types should have been measured under identical conditions to those used in these experiments.\nIt is particularly important to understand the free energy G ( \u03b1r ) associated to ( unconstrained ) superhelicity, as this affects all the equilibria considered in this paper. Eq. 1 above assigns a quadratic free energy to the linking difference \u03b1. For present purposes this is adequate, as it has been shown to be correct for ccDNA plasmids in dilute solution, where all superhelicity is unconstrained so \u03b1 = \u03b1r ( 8\u201310 ) . However, in more complex environments many factors may affect energetics. The free energy of superhelicity need not always be a simple parabolic function. It could have asymmetries due to higher order terms, beyond the quadratic. Its quadratic coefficient q might dominate only close to \u03b1 = 0, and could have different values in different environments. To understand how unconstrained superhelicity affects other molecular processes, its effective free energy needs to be accurately known under a variety of conditions.\nTheory suggests that superhelical transitions may occur at less extreme superhelicities in domains whose tertiary structures are constrained than they do when otherwise identical domains are free in solution ( 95 ) . Experimentally, superhelical strand separation has been shown to occur at less extreme negative superhelicities in increasing concentrations of 80 kDa polyethylene glycol, a crowding agent ( 96 ) . This suggests that the free energy of superhelicity may be higher in crowded environments than it is when otherwise identical topoisomers\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nare free in solution. Both of these effects suggest that transitions could occur more easily ( i.e. at less extreme unconstrained superhelicities ) in cellular or nuclear environments where crowding of up to 40% occurs and tertiary structures are constrained, than they do in solution."

            "text": "The transition energies used in the present models are specified at base pair resolution, but other attributes have only been given average or simplified values. DNA conformations do not have uniform structural or mechanical attributes. Their helicities and torsional flexibilities are known to vary with base sequence. Also, some sequences have natural curvature, which could endow relaxed conformations with writhe, nucleate plectonemes or other forms of bending, and affect binding. Junction energies could vary with the sequences of the regions involved. The contour lengths and other attributes of unpaired strands may vary considerably depending on the extent of base stacking they retain.\nThe models presented here could be extended to include sequence-specific depictions of DNA structural attributes ( viz. unstressed helicities, contour lengths, curvatures and tertiary structures ) , and mechanical attributes ( torsional or bending stiffnesses ) , provided the necessary information is known. Including such refinements can significantly increase the complexity of the algorithms required to implement calculations. But it also may increase the accuracy or utility of their results.\nOther extensions that may prove important include considering the effects that molecular lesions or epigenetic modifications have on unstressed conformations and helicities, transition energetics and distributions of residual superhelicity. In particular, lesions that disrupt base pairing could nucleate strand separation in negatively superhelical domains. This might be anticipated to occur when the lesion diminishes or eliminates the nucleation energy cost of opening its binding site.\nPartitionings of superhelicity between twist and writhe A given amount of superhelicity can manifest as many different combinations of writhings ( viz. plectonemic, toroidal, irregular, etc. ) and twistings ( conformational transitions, smooth deformations, etc. ) , all of which are coupled together by Lebowitz \u2032 s law. For present purposes we have not needed to consider this partitioning explicitly. This simplification has been possible because the change T of total twist that occurs in a domain due to all the structural transitions and deformations of helicity that occur there repartitions its superhelicity as \u03b1 = T + \u03b1r . And energies can be associated to transitions, to torsional deformations, and to the residual superhelicity \u03b1r . This is all that is needed to model transition equilibria. But for many other purposes - including modeling the repartitioning of superhelicity that occurs as RNAP translocates during transcription ( 97 ) - it remains important to consider how writhe and twist manifest within domains, and how they interconvert.\nUnfortunately, explicitly decomposing the residual superhelicity of a state into its twist and writhe components greatly complicates any theoretical analysis, even in the simplest case of a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic, fully B-form model ccDNA. While free energies may be associated directly with conformational transitions and with torsional deforma-\ntions of secondary structures, the same is not true for writhe. The stresses and energies associated with changes of tertiary structure arise from deformations of the DNA\u2019s curvature and from contacts, and may involve larger units such as 30 nm fibers. But the topological constraint that DNA domains must satisfy couples twist with writhe, not with curvature. And the relationship between writhe and curvature has not been fully explored as yet.\nDespite this limitation, much theoretical work has been done to model superhelical DNA structures as topologically constrained mechanical objects. Here the DNA is regarded as being endowed with mechanical properties, and mechanical equilibria of superhelical domains are sought ( 98\u2013105 ) . Simple statistical models of dynamically fluctuating tertiary structures in fully B-form domains with uniform mechanical properties also have been developed ( 106 ,107 ) . More challenging questions, such as those arising when one includes natural curvature, inhomogeneities of mechanical and conformational parameters, simultaneous coupled fluctuations of bending and twist, binding events, and transitions to alternate structures having different unstressed conformations and deformation energies, still require work. This is a large topic, deserving of its own review.\nFor present purposes one point is important. Within the collection of states that are compatible with a given superhelicity \u03b1, the interplay between twisting and writhing that occurs is determined largely by mechanical properties of the DNA involved ( and perhaps also of larger structures that contain it, such as bound complexes or the 30 nm fiber ) . This interplay will change as topological and structural constraints form, rearrange, or release because the collection of possible states changes. But within each collection the interactions between twist and writhe that occur will be largely mechanically determined. Two examples illustrate this point.\nWe have seen that twisting and writhing are topologically coupled within superhelical domains, as described by Lebowitz\u2019s law. But they also are mechanically coupled, even in nicked circles and linear segments. It is a common experience that, when the end of a hose or a cable is twisted against resistance, it tends to rise up into a supercoil. In engineering this is called hockling ( 108 ) . In DNA it would be a transduction of twist into writhe ( 99 , 109 , 110 ) .\nSecond, how unconstrained superhelicity is partitioned between twisting and plectonemic writhing will change as mechanical tension is imposed or relieved, with extension favoring twist over writhe ( 111 ) . This behavior also can be observed in macroscopic cables, strands and hoses.\nSome experimental information is available regarding the partitioning of DNA superhelicity among twisting, writhing and transitions. The ratio of total twist deformations to writhe in the natively superhelical COP608 plasmid has been evaluated by small angle x-ray scattering at various ionic strengths ( 112 ) . These ccDNA molecules scatter as toroidal supercoils whose pitch angles and contour lengths per turn can be determined from their scattering patterns ( 113 ) . From this information and the plasmid \u2032 s total length, a unique best-fitting toroidal helix can be constructed, and its writhe W calculated. By Eq. 4 the difference between W and the plasmid \u2032 s superhelicity \u03b1 = L ( which is known ) gives its total twist deformation T . ( This assumes that the relaxed writhe is W 0 = 0. ) Here T includes both the changes of twist involved in the conformational transitions from B-form to whatever alternate structures are present, and the smooth torsional deformations\no [ s w o r\nB c\ne i t l r i s\nE A p p u c f r p\nv m e o s n p m m a p\nD T i e D o b p t R w i c s a p\n( c p T h\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nf all secondary structures that occur. In this experiment, when Na] + = 0.1 M the ratio between these quantities in natively uperhelical plasmids was determined to be T / W \u2248 2.0. But hen the ionic strength was increased to [Na] + = 0.2 M ( at r slightly above the physiological range ) an almost complete epartitioning of superhelicity to twist was seen to occur, with T / W \u2265 25. This change was interpreted as resulting from -Z transitions, the only transition type then known to be failitated by increasing ionic strength.\nOpposite results were found when microscopy was used to xamine a different superhelical plasmid ( 114 ) . There a simlarly substantial repartitioning of \u03b1 towards twist deformaions and away from writhe was observed when the monovaent cation concentration was decreased . The extent of writhe elaxation observed strongly suggested that this repartitionng was due to superhelical transitions. In particular, strand eparation becomes more favored at lower ionic strengths.\nquilibria versus dynamics ll the models of superhelical transitions described to this oint have calculated equilibrium distributions. This aproach has the benefit of ( relative ) simplicity, and can yield seful results. However, although biochemical and biophysial systems commonly tend towards their equilibria, in vivo ew attain them. Instead, most systems participate in, and are egulated by, intricately interwoven webs of coupled dynamic rocesses. Full understanding of complex, time-dependent events inolving DNA structural transitions will require the developent and testing of increasingly complicated dynamical modls. To date only simple models of this sort have been develped that focus just on one transition type, superhelical strand eparation ( 115\u2013118 ) . Much remains to be done before dyamical models can be designed and implemented that are caable of handling competing transitions in kilobase scale doains with any base sequence in complex, evolving environents. But on the experimental side, intriguing new strategies re elucidating both equilibrium and dynamical aspects of suerhelical DNA structural transitions ( 96 ,119 ) .\nomain networks he only types of topological domains that have been explictly considered here are closed flexible circles ( ccDNAs ) and nd-constrained linear segments. But regions within genomic NA may connect in various ways to other DNA regions r complexes, to scaffold elements via S / MARs, or to memranes. The connections that form may be transitory or more ermanent. They may be rigid, or they may allow bond roations that change dihedral angles ( angles between planes ) . otatable connections can constrain the DNA in a variety of ays\u2014geometrically, mechanically and perhaps also topologcally. Different connections or combinations of connections ould form different types of domain boundaries. Multiple uch connections within or between chromosomes could crete intricate webs of topologically and / or mechanically couled genomic DNA segments. Different types of interconnections are known. Cohesins 120 ) are protein complexes that form ring structures which an lasso DNA duplexes. This constrains these duplexes to ass through the ring, but does not otherwise restrain them. hey may rotate within the ring, and reptate through it. Coesins cannot change any topological properties of the par-\nticipating DNA domains so long as no strands are cut. But they can greatly alter their sets of accessible tertiary structures ( 121 ) .\nAs connections are made and released, dynamically evolving networks of coupled regions would arise ( 120 , 122 , 123 ) . Forming or eliminating cohesin connections, for example, could affect the partitioning of superhelicity between plectonemic interwinding and other writhed or twisted conditions. Forming or eliminating physical connections can change domain boundaries and the topological and / or mechanical constraints they impose.\nWhile some information is available regarding the types of DNA connections that occur in vivo ( 123 ) , less is known about what mechanical and topological networks they form, how the topologies, geometries and mechanical properties of the DNA regions involved are constrained, what effects these constraints have on energetics, or how they might influence regulatory processes."

            "text": "Duplex DNA can have several topological forms. Linear segments with free ends all have the same topology, in which both twist and tertiary structure can fluctuate independently. Nicked circles ( ncDNAs ) are another topology in which twist is free to fluctuate but the central axis curve must close on itself, forming a flexible ring. Closed circular DNAs ( ccDNAs ) and rigidly held duplex segments are a third topological type, in which the linking numbers of domains have fixed integer values. The secondary and tertiary structures of each topoisomer are coupled together by Lebowitz \u2032 s law. Otherwise identical topoisomers that have different linking numbers ( i.e. superhelicities ) are topologically distinct and must sample disjoint collections of states.\nDNA domains also can be topologically constrained in other ways. A ccDNA may be knotted, or not ( 124\u2013126 ) . Two or more ccDNAs may catenate ( interlink ) ( 124 ) . Multiple end-constrained duplex DNA segments may braid together ( 127 ,128 ) . In each case the domains involved may be relaxed, superhelically stressed, or nicked. All these conditions are topological because they do not change when continuous deformations of the participating DNA duplexes occur. Only discontinuous changes - cutting one or both strands or ligating strand ends together - can alter the topological state of a DNA. Cutting a single strand within a topological domain eliminates the linking constraint ( i.e. superhelicity ) , but does not affect the other topological conditions it may experience. Only double strand cuts can change knot or braid type, or catenation state.\nNicking a knotted ccDNA does not change its knot type because its continuous strand remains knotted, and the two strands are base paired. But nicking does enable a knotted domain to sample states around its relaxed state. Upon closure, a knotted ccDNA will have an integer linking number, and its twist and writhe must satisfy Lebowitz \u2032 s law. TOPO1 acting on a population of identically knotted topoisomers creates a distribution, the center of which determines a relaxed linking number L 0, K whose value may vary with knot type K . A knotted domain \u2032 s superhelicity is the difference between its actual linking number and this relaxed value. Each knotted topoisomer will have a unique set of accessible conformations\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/22/7442541 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\ndetermined jointly by its knot type and superhelicity ( 129 ) . As before, free energy will be needed to impose superhelicity on a knotted domain, but the amount required may depend on its knot type. In particular, its quadratic coefficient q K may be different for different knot types. Braids and catenanes can be treated similarly.\nMultiple topological constraints can be imposed simultaneously. Two circular DNAs may catenate, for example. Each may be knotted or not, and each may be either superhelical, relaxed or nicked. Genomic DNA segments also can experience other, non-topological forms of entanglement.\nEach of these four topological conditions ( braiding, catenation, knotting and superhelicity ) constrains a domain \u2032 s tertiary structures. But only superhelicity does so by coupling tertiary structure to secondary structure. So changing superhelicity has consequences\u2014especially regarding secondary structure\u2014that would not occur if the knot or braid type or catenation state of a domain alone were altered. This makes superhelicity unique among these four topological attributes."

            "text": "Changing DNA topology requires either making or repairing single- or double-strand breaks.\nTOPO1-type activities produce transient single strand breaks ( SSBs ) . Uncontrolled SSBs also can occur as molecular lesions. An SSB occurring in an otherwise duplex topological domain changes its topology from closed and perhaps superhelical, to nicked. When all SSBs are religated the linking number again takes on a fixed integer value, possibly different from its value before the SSBs occurred.\nTOPO2-type activities resolve duplex crossings by transiently creating a double strand break ( DSB ) in one duplex, then passing the other duplex through the resulting gap prior to ligation. This can change linking numbers, knot or braid types, or catenation states of domains. Transpositions, inversions, insertions, deletions and similar genomic events require double strand breaks, both to excise segments from their original sites and to insert them ( or others ) at new locations. DSBs also can occur as lesions induced by chemical or radiation damage.\nCorrectly repairing DSBs is critical for maintaining the viability of cells in which they occur. If more than one DSB is present, a DNA end produced by one break could be attached to an end produced by another. The resulting translocation brings into physical contiguity parts of the genome that originally were remote, perhaps in different domains or on different chromosomes, and separates sites that were adjacent. Such rearrangements can disrupt genes and regulatory regions. They also would change superhelical transition properties. Translocation separates sites that originally were close enough to have been superhelically coupled, and replaces them with other sites that may compete differently.\nThe presence of knots, braids, catenanes and nontopological entanglements can impair the functioning of genomic DNA. Unless prevented or resolved, they may impede essential processes such as transcription, replication and chromosome separation ( 130 ,131 ) . Resolving duplex crossings that otherwise would prevent correct chromatid segregation is thought to be an important function of eukaryotic TOPO2s, perhaps aided by cohesins ( 121 ) . But any action that resolves duplex crossings also would tend to untie knots and braids, and unlink catenanes. Then superhelicity would be the only\ntopological constraint among these four whose level could be modulated."

Some strongly constrain the DNA, while others allow local fluctuations.\nNucleosome formation and the binding of complexes, regulatory ligands or architectural proteins can constrain or fix tertiary structure and / or local helicity ( secondary structure ) . Transitions to non-B DNA conformations can absorb large amounts of negative superhelicity as undertwist, allowing the rest of a domain to relax a corresponding amount. That portion of the linking difference which is not packaged in constrained ways such as these must be accommodated by fluctuations among the many coupled twistings and writhings that are possible. If energies can be associated to residual superhelicities and to whatever constraints or conditions are present, theoretical models of their occurrences can be developed."

            "text": "The twin facts that genomic DNAs have many sites that are susceptible to forming alternate structures, and that non-B structures frequently do occur in vivo suggest that the modulation of structural transitions by superhelicity might play roles in specific biological processes. While examples are known where this appears to be true, how widespread it may be is not known.\nDNA superhelicity provides novel mechanisms by which remote sites within genomic domains could interact. The occurrence or inhibition of a conformational transition at one site will affect the distribution of unconstrained superhelicity within its domain, which can alter the occurrences of other transitions and / or binding events elsewhere ( 132 ) . In this way, DNA superhelicity can couple together the structures, and thereby perhaps also the binding propensities and activities, of possibly remote susceptible sites.\nIf a regulatory ligand or complex requires its DNA binding site to be in a particular conformation, and if that site also is susceptible to a superhelical transition, then whether or how strongly binding occurs would depend on which structure is present. So whatever process binding regulates could be either facilitated or impeded by superhelicity, depending on which way it acts and which secondary structure is required for binding. Some DNA binding molecules induce or stabilize the conformations to which they bind ( 132 ,133 ) . Changes of unconstrained superhelicity that result when alternate structures are either facilitated or impeded can influence bindings or transitions elsewhere in their domains. Topological interconnections such as these could form regulatory allosteric networks. Mutations that either inhibit transitions at favored sites or render unfavored sites competitive could cause such networks to malfunction, perhaps with pathological consequences."

DNA topology can only be changed by mechanisms hat make single-strand or double-strand cuts or ligations.\nAmong the topological conditions available to a duplex NA, superhelicity ( the fixing of the linking number L within domain ) is uniquely important. Fixing L couples a doain\u2019s secondary structure to its tertiary structure according o Lebowitz \u2032 s law. In consequence, any integer value of L ( i.e. uperhelicity ) this domain might have can be accommodated y many combinations of twisted ( secondary ) and writhed tertiary ) conformations.\nOne way that superhelicity can be packaged is as changes f twist. Processes that either facilitate or inhibit such changes an be affected by the levels of ( residual ) superhelicity they exerience. In principle, negative superhelicity could drive conormational transitions to any alternate DNA structures that re substantially less twisted than is B-DNA. If more than one lternate structure is possible within a domain, as commonly ccurs, superhelicity would couple their transitions together, ith the occurrence of one inhibiting others. As suggested by the simple examples developed here, cometitions among superhelical transitions could be complex. quilibrium distributions are dominated by the lowest energy ombinations of transitions that leave the least residual suerhelicity. Although a domain may contain many sites whose equences render them susceptible to forming alternate strucures, only the most competitive combinations among them ill be significantly represented in its equilibrium distribuions at physiologically attained negative superhelicities. Tranitions that would occur under these conditions if their sites ere the only susceptible regions in a domain can be outompeted by other, more energetically favored alternatives, f any are present. So, results from simple systems should be nterpreted with caution, be they theoretical models such as hose presented here or in vitro experiments on model plasids. In another context the same set of sites could behave uite differently if they compete with different alternatives. Whatever DNA structural transitions do occur in biological ystems may be expected to result from more complex mechnisms than just superhelicity.
