"In summary, we demonstrated an overall survival prediction for glioblastoma patients at 74% accuracy using a multi-branch 3D convolutional neural network, where each branch was a different MR image sequence. The system classified patients into two classes (longand short-term survival). In a comparison on the same data with the best known predictor, our approach was 6% more accurate. An important contribution of this work is the effective use of snapshot ensembles in a novel fashion towards a solution to the limited availability of labeled images in many medical imaging datasets. Snapshots are a fast, low cost way to generate an ensemble of classifiers. Based on recent studies [26â€“34], improved communication and information exchange between radiology and histopathology is needed more than ever. Many papers have shown benefits in integrating several markers for more accurate OS prediction of patients with glioma. A study [29] used deep artificial neural networks on histopathologic images of gliomas and found an association of OS with several histopathologic features, such as pseudopalisading and geographic necrosis and inflammation. Recent work [26,32,33] has shown the integrated potential of MR and histopathologic images, which has provided diagnostically relevant information for the prediction of OS in glioma. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that combining radiomics with multiomics can offer additional prognostic value [34]. Another study confirmed higher prediction accuracy when a combination of histopathologic images and genomic markers (isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH], 1p/19q) was used [27]. Moreover, it has been shown that the addition of a radiomics model to clinical and genetic profiles improved survival prediction on glioblastoma when compared with models containing clinical and genetic profiles alone [28]. This study has the limitation of using a pre-operative dataset to perform OS prediction. This can result in leaving out several prognostic factors that are available after histological confirmation. In research, the most common prognostic factors for survival in glioblastoma patients were found to be: The age of patients, extent of resection, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class [35], performance status (using Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) or the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/World Health Organization (WHO) performance status) [36], and postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [37].
