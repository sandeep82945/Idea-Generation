Exploring MDM2 Inhibitors from Diverse Natural Sources: Building on the findings that Taxifolin and (-)-Epicatechin have high stability and binding affinity with the MDM2 protein, future research could broaden the search for MDM2 inhibitors among a wider variety of natural sources. This includes screening other plant-derived compounds, marine bioactives, and microbial metabolites using in silico approaches for their potential to interact with MDM2, followed by in vitro and in vivo validation.

Advanced Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Compound Optimization: The successful use of molecular dynamics simulations for Taxifolin and (-)-Epicatechin suggests this method could be expanded to optimize these compounds further. Researchers can focus on modifying the chemical structures of these compounds to enhance their binding affinity, selectivity for MDM2, and pharmacokinetic properties, aiming for improved therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects.

Investigating the Role of MDM2 in Resistance Mechanisms: Given the pivotal role of MDM2 in the p53 pathway, future studies could delve into how mutations or overexpression of MDM2 contributes to resistance mechanisms in LGG and other cancers. This research could help in understanding how to overcome resistance to therapy by targeting MDM2 or its downstream effectors.

Development of Combination Therapies Targeting MDM2: Based on the prognostic significance of MDM2 in LGG, future research could investigate the efficacy of combination therapies that include MDM2 inhibitors (like Taxifolin and (-)-Epicatechin) with other therapeutic agents. This could include combining with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other targeted therapies to enhance treatment outcomes and minimize resistance.

Clinical Trials of Identified Phytochemicals: The next step would involve conducting clinical trials for the most promising compounds identified through in silico and in vitro/in vivo studies. This would validate the effectiveness and safety of these compounds in humans, moving closer to developing new, plant-derived therapeutic options for managing LGG. These trials could focus on dosage optimization, side effects profiling, and efficacy compared to current treatments.
