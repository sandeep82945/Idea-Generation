In SCs, energymetabolism is important as disorders of energy metabolism result in infertility eventually. However, the underlying mechanism of lipotoxicity on energy metabolism in SCs remains unknown. Advances in high-throughput metabolomics and lipidomics measurement platforms provide powerful tools to gain insights into complex biological systems. Here, we aimed to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of palmitic acid (PA) regulating energy metabolism in SCs based on metabolomics and lipidomics. The results showed that glucose metabolismrelated metabolites were not significantly changed, which suggested that PA treatment had little effect on glucose metabolism and may not influence the normal energy supply from SCs to germ cells. However, fatty acid b-oxidation was inhibited according to accumulation of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines in cells. In addition, the pool of amino acids and the levels of most individual amino acids involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were not changed after PA treatment in SCs. Moreover, PA treatment of SCs significantly altered the lipidome, including significant decreases in cardiolipin and glycolipids as well as remarkable increases in ceramide and lysophospholipids, which indicated that mitochondrial function was affected and apoptosis was triggered. The increased apoptosis rate of SCs was verified by elevated protein expression levels of Cleaved Caspase-3 and Bax as well as decreased Bcl-2 protein expression level. Together, these findings indicated that PAmay result in mitochondrial dysfunction and increased apoptosis by inhibiting fatty acid b-oxidation of SCs.\nKEYWORDS\npalmitic acid, Sertoli cell, energy metabolism, metabolomics, lipidomics, apoptosis, mitochondria\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Obesity has various metabolic complications, including a negative impact on fertility, which has received increasing attention (1, 2). Obesity is often accompanied by dysregulation of free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism, including elevated saturated fatty acids and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids (3). Palmitic acid (PA) is the most common long-chain saturated FFA in human plasma, and it has been reported that dietary intake of PA is posit ive ly associated with asthenospermia (4, 5), indicating an association between PA and male infertility. However, the specific mechanism by which PA affects male infertility remains unclear and needs to be further explored.\nSertoli cells (SCs) play an important role in the development of germ cells (GCs) as they provide physical and nutritional support for the GCs to maintain spermatogenesis (6). Lactate is produced by glucose metabolism in SCs, and it serves as a substrate for GCs to generate energy (7). At the same time, SCs produce their own energy through fatty acid b-oxidation (8). In addition to fatty acid b-oxidation, some amino acids also serve as independent substrates to supply energy for SCs through entering the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (9). Therefore, energy metabolic homeostasis in SCs is vital in male reproduction (6).\nIt has been reported that PA overload causes intracellular metabolic disorders and interferes with energy metabolism balance in cardiomyocytes, HepG2 cells, and adipocytes (10) (11). Our previous study showed that PA impaired spermatogenesis by regulating metabolism in SCs, and we speculated that PA may impair mitochondrial function in SCs (12). However, the specific mechanism of PA regulating energy metabolism in SCs remains unclear. Moreover, many studies have reported that PA impairs the function of SCs, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and apoptosis, but it is not clear whether PA leads to these damages by altering energy metabolism in SCs (13) (14) (15).\nRecent advances in the integration of metabolomics and lipidomics have greatly extended their reach in biomedical and clinical research, and they have been declared as the key to advancing precision medicine (16). Here, we used a combination of metabolomics and lipidomics to explore the potential mechanism of PA regulating the energy metabolism in SCs and to provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of lipotoxicity injury in SCs function."

            "text": "The negative effects of lipotoxicity on male fertility has gained attention in recent years. As is well known, SCs are an indispensable part in male reproduction (14). However, relevant studies focusing on the influence of lipotoxicity on energy metabolism in SCs are limited. Here, we treated SCs with PA to comprehensively analyze the effect of lipotoxicity on the energy metabolism of SCs through metabolomics and lipidomics analysis. Because the proportion of SCs in testes is low (only 3\u20135%), a whole testis is not sufficient to conduct analysis to reflect the changes in SCs. Thus, we extracted primary SCs for more detailed study and analysis. The present study demonstrated that PA inhibits mitochondrial function and triggers apoptosis by inhibiting fatty acid b-oxidation in SCs. Metabolomics is a method that accurately analyzes the dynamic metabolic changes in cells, tissues, and whole organisms. We performed metabolomics analysis on the related substances of the three major energy metabolites in cells. In the process of spermatogenesis, SCs only use a small part of glucose to meet their own energy needs but convert most of the glucose into lactate, which is used for the GC energy supply (21). In the present study, we found that most of the metabolome features detected for the glucose metabolism pathway, such as pyruvate and lactate, were not significantly changed in PA-treated SCs. Both our previous and present study\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 06\nfound that the intracellular lactate level was not changed (12), suggesting that the glucose metabolism of SCs is not affected by PA and that they still maintain the normal supportive function for GCs.\nFatty acids are the main energy substrate of SCs (22). It has been reported that 66% of PA is processed by fatty acid boxidation to generate CO2 in SCs (20). The accumulation of long-chain fatty acylcarnitines has been regarded as a manifestation of the inhibition of fatty acid b-oxidation (23). The present study showed that a large amount of long-chain fatty acylcarnitines accumulated after PA treatment, indicating that fatty acid b-oxidation in SCs is hindered by PA. We have previously reported that PA increases the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) at the mRNA and protein levels (12). Combined with the present results, we propose that after PA stimulation, SCs become active in the b-oxidation of fatty acids due to the increased uptake of fatty acids. However, excess PA impairs mitochondrial function and eventually inhibits the boxidation of fatty acids, causing sustained accumulation of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines as well as a decrease in short-chain acylcarnitines.\nThe major functions of amino acids in SCs include generating protein, participating in the TCA cycle to generate energy, and participating in lipid production (9). Some studies have confirmed that valine, leucine, alanine, glutamine, and\nFIGURE 2 Effect of PA on glucose and lactate metabolism of SCs. After glucose is taken up by SCs, pyruvate is produced through glycolysis. Most of the pyruvate is used to produce and secrete lactate for GCs to provide energy, and only a small part of pyruvate participates in the TCA cycle. Levels of glucose (A), fructose-6-phosphate (B), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (C), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (D), pyruvate (E), lactate (F), and acetyl-CoA (G).

Metabolomics analysis indicated that the levels of glutamine and glutamate were significantly decreased. However, we were unable to determine if the PA-induced reduced amino acids were involved in the TCA cycle, indicating that further investigation is required. Interestingly, the total amount of amino acids that participated in the TCA cycle did not change, suggesting that PA treatment may not affect the amino acid metabolism in SCs and that amino acid metabolism does not compensate for the deficient energy supply due to fatty acid oxidation.\nBecause the energy supply was influenced, we speculated that the function of SCs was affected. To further explore the effect of PA on SCs, lipidomics analysis was performed on SCs. Accumulation of FFA in the TG pool is thought to be a buffering effect against lipotoxicity (25). In the present study, lipidomics analysis demonstrated that the levels of TG and DG in SCs were increased after PA treatment, illustrating that SCs may\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 07\ncounteract the harmful effects of lipotoxicity for a short period of time. However, after the protective effect disappears, intracellular fatty acids will continue to exert their destructive effect on the cells. In addition, large amounts of PA inhibit TG synthesis at the DG stage, allowing DG to accumulate in cells (26). The present findings suggested that the protective effect of SCs is ceased and that lipotoxicity begins to have a progressive and devastating effect.\nHigh concentrations of PA lead to upregulation and increased activity of nSMase and serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), resulting in increased de novo synthesis of CER and release of So from the cell membrane to convert to CER (22). It has been reported that the addition of CER to the medium inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain and induces voltage-dependent anion channel closure, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction (20), altered expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, and ROS generation, eventually resulting in apoptosis (27, 28). In addition, phospholipids can be metabolized from PA and continue to be metabolized to\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 3 Effect of PA on acylcarnitines in SCs. The schematic diagram of fatty acid b-oxidation in SCs is shown on the left. Free carnitine in plasma enters cells through organic cation/carnitine transporter 2 (OCTN2). Long-chain fatty acids then enter the mitochondria with the help of carnitine and are transformed into acylcarnitines by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which is located in the outer membrane of mitochondria. Acylcarnitines then pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) through carnitine acyltransferase (CACT) to exchange free carnitine. Carnitine palmitoyltransferases 2 (CPT 2), which is located in the IMM, converts acylcarnitines into acyl-CoA and free L-carnitine for the next oxidation reaction. Medium- and short-chain fatty acids do not require carnitine to enter mitochondria for oxidation. Subsequently, acylcarnitines are oxidized in the form of acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) by a series of enzymes to produce acyl-CoA with two less carbon atoms than the original and acetyl-CoA, which is finally oxidized by the TCA cycle to produce CO2 and H\u2082O as well as to release energy. The changes in long-, medium- and short-chain acylcarnitines are shown in panels A\u2013C, respectively. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\nfrontiersin.org\nlysophospholipids, which promote apoptosis through various pathways (27, 29, 30). Moreover, another component of GLs, CL, is contained in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and it is not found in any other organelle. In healthy\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 08\nmitochondria, CL interacts with proteins to support cristae, stabilize respiratory chain complexes, and regulate autophagy in the IMM. Hence, decreased CL is a marker of impaired mitochondrial function (31, 32).\nA B\nD\nC\nFIGURE 4 Effect of PA on amino acid metabolism of SCs.

In addition, the mRNA level of smpd3, which encodes nSMase, was elevated, thereby verifying that the synthesis of CER increases after PA stimulation. The increased mRNA level of cls1, a gene encoding CL synthase, may indicate a compensatory upregulation of CL remodeling and mitochondrial biogenesis in SCs treated by PA. Furthermore, it is unknown whether CL lipid precursors are downregulated in PA-treated SCs, resulting in a decrease in total CL despite the upregulation of cls1 mRNA (33). We have previously stained SCs with MitoSOX and MitoTracker, demonstrating that there is increased mitochondrial ROS levels in PA-treated SCs (12). In addition, we have previously used an extracellular flux analyzer to demonstrate that the ATP level is significantly reduced and that the proton leak is significantly increased in SCs treated with PA (12). Thus, the present study further confirmed our hypothesis of impaired mitochondrial function induced by PA.\nMitochondria play a key role in cell death and its regulation, and Bcl-2 family proteins control mitochondrial outer membrane permeability by regulating membrane potential (34). The imbalance of Bcl-2 family expression results in the release of proapoptotic factors into the cytoplasm, thereby inducing apoptosis (35). The present study demonstrated that PA treatment of SCs reduced cell viability, upregulated Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and downregulated Bcl-2 expression. These results indicated that PA induces apoptosis through the imbalance of Bcl-2 family proteins in SCs.\nIn summary, we conducted an in-depth study of changes in the energy metabolism of SCs under the effect of PA using a\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 09\ncombination of metabolomics and lipidomics analyses. The results showed that fatty acid b-oxidation of SCs is disrupted after PA treatment. Although SCs are still able to provide energy for GCs under PA stimulation, their own source of energy supply is inhibited, causing mitochondrial damage, leading to apoptosis."
