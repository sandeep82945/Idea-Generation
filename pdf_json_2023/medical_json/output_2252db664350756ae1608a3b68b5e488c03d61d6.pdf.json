    "abstractText": "Active packaging is one of the currently thriving methods to preserve highly perishable foods. Nonetheless, the integration of active substances into the formulation of the packaging may alter their properties\u2014particularly mass transfer properties\u2014and therefore, the active compounds acting. Different formulations of chitosan (CH), starch (ST), and their blends (CH-ST), with the addition of mango leaf extract (MLE) have been polymerized by casting to evaluate their food preservation efficiency. A CH-ST blend with 3% MLE using 7.5 mL of the filmogenic solution proved to be the most effective formulation because of its high bioactivity (ca. 80% and 74% of inhibition growth of S. aureus and E. coli, respectively, and 40% antioxidant capacity). The formulation reduced the water solubility and water vapor permeability while increasing UV protection, properties that provide a better preservation of raspberry fruit after 13 days than the control. Moreover, a novel method of Headspace-Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry to analyze the volatile profiles of the films is employed, to study the potential modification of the food in contact with the active film. These migrated compounds were shown to be closely related to both the mango extract additions and the film\u2019s formulation themselves, showing different fingerprints depending on the film.",

            "text": "The reduction in food loss and waste are of primary importance to guarantee the food supply worldwide, so it has been included as one of the goals to achieve among the Sustainable Developments Goals for 2030. In this sense, the efficient use of preservative techniques plays an essential role in the food industry since it can extend the shelf life of food products. The preservation of food products facilitates their handling and transport, which allows the consumption of foodstuffs in the locations where they are not produced, thus ensuring foreign trade of fresh or minimally processed products, as fourth-range products based on fruit and vegetables. However, the shelf life of these products is quite short, and they are particularly susceptible to deteriorating agents [1]. Oxidation and hydrolysis of lipids are some of the chemical alterations that food can undergo and that may cause rancidity and off-flavor, enzymatic degradations associated with color and texture alterations, non-enzymatic browning due to Maillard and hydrolysis reactions, as well as the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and/or molds [2]. In recent years, fresh food packaging is focused on increasing the use of biodegradable bio-based polymers, which already account for about 36.3% of industrially produced bioplastics [3]. In this sense, the studies of film biodegradable formulations, and their effectiveness in real food experiments, have yet to\nFoods 2023, 12, 2977. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12152977 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 2977 2 of 23\nbe studied to achieve industrial applications and thus, lead to higher implementation of biodegradable films in the market. In the biodegradable polymer field, starch is one of the products that can be easily and cheaply obtained from agricultural by-products [4]. Nevertheless, naturally-based film packaging usually presents unsatisfactory mechanical, thermal, or water barrier capacities when compared to more conventional packaging materials [5]. In the case of starch, undesirable changes in the thermomechanical properties caused by the re-crystallization and retrogradation of its structure can jeopardize its use as the only polymer in the film formulation [6,7]. Furthermore, chitosan stands out because of its intrinsic antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, film-forming capacity, and good permeability to CO2 and to O2 [8], and it has been widely combined with starch-based polymers to enhance their properties [9\u201311], together with the incorporation of cross-linkers, surfactants, and even active substances that intervene in food preservation [4,12]. This last option is very convenient since it also provides functional properties, turning into active packaging materials. In this matter, the use of natural substances from agri-food by-products is an ongoing trend, because it improves the added value of the film and promotes the food industry to its transformation towards a circular economy model. The use of essential oils from aromatic herbs and spices, such as thyme, eucalyptus, parsley, or rosemary [13\u201315], or natural extracts, rich in phenolic compounds, obtained from agricultural by-products, such as pomaces [16\u201318] or leaves [19\u201321], have been reported. Mango-derived compounds have been previously added to films, both as nutraceuticals [22] and food preservers [23\u201325], with promising results in terms of the transferring of their properties to the packaging polymer film. These additives have the aim of modifying the film\u2019s permeability to certain gases, thus preventing the growth of microorganisms, retarding food oxidation, or even slowing down the ripening of packed fruits or vegetables [26]. Despite the advantages of functionalized polymers for food packaging, the migration of active compounds from the packaging to the food is one of the key aspects of the development of these technologies. In fact, not only the polymer/active substance formulation and their interactions determine their effectiveness, but also the technique used for the production of the films can have an influence on the migration of the active compounds [27]. One of the drawbacks associated with the use of natural additives is that high concentrations are to be added to the polymer film formulation to be effective, which could result in the transfer of undesirable odors and flavors to the food [26]. In this sense, the possible packaging/food migration that may occur must be monitored and controlled. Until now, the majority of the analytical techniques used to corroborate the kinetic release of compounds from active films have focused on the identification of non-volatile compounds, mainly polyphenols, to assess their bioactivity. These studies are usually performed in food simulants or buffer solutions further analyzed spectrophotometrically or by liquid chromatography [28\u201330]. However, in food-contact materials, it is also important to corroborate if any Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are released from the biofilms into the headspace of the food package. The migration of these VOCs might either promote preservation and/or modify the organoleptic properties of the food. The conventional methods used to detect VOCs from food packaging are generally time-consuming, non-ecological, and require skilled labor [31]. However, in recent years, the potential of Headspace-Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) is emerging in the food control field for the analysis of VOCs, because of its numerous advantages [32] such as short time analysis, ultrahigh sensitivity, high stability, and good repeatability. HS-GC-IMS has been successfully applied to determine VOC changes for the rapid detection of contamination in certain foods, such as corn or wheat [33,34], although the use of this technique to assess the volatile migration from the active film has not been previously tested. For all the above said, this work intends to determine the influence of the formulation of starch and chitosan biodegradable active films containing mango leaf extract on its physical, functional, and preservative properties, as well as to evaluate the migration of volatile compounds into the headspace of the package depending on their different formulation,\nFoods 2023, 12, 2977 3 of 23\nin order to establish the most suitable one. The selected films were subsequently used to preserve raspberries as an example of a highly perishable fresh product. The preservation has been visually monitored for a 13-day storage period."

            "text": "The films made of chitosan (CH), starch (ST), or a combination of both compounds (CH-ST) were produced by solvent casting in 55 mm-diameter polystyrene Petri dishes. The chitosan films were prepared using the method described by Siripatrawan and Harte [36] and Ruiz-Navajas et al. [37], with some modifications. A 2% w/v chitosan solution was prepared with distilled water containing 1% w/v acetic acid and 0.3% v/v glycerol (pH 2.53). This solution was shaken vigorously for 15 min on a magnetic plate to favor the homogenization of the components. After this, a specific volume of extract was added to the solution and the shaking was performed another 15 min. Then, the preparations were subjected to ultrasound and vacuum for 15 and 35 min, respectively, to remove any trace of air from the solution that might interfere with the film polymerization. Finally, the different volumes were poured into Petri dishes and allowed to dry at room temperature for 48 h. On the other hand, the starch films were produced based on the procedures described by Pi\u00f1eros-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. [38] and Reddy and Yang [39]. The solutions were composed of 2% w/v starch and 2.4% v/v glycerol in distilled water (pH 6). The preparations were first heated at 85 \u25e6C under stirring. After tempering, a certain volume of MLE was added and shaken for 15 min. Then, the solutions were plated and polymerized for 72 h at room temperature. Finally, a chitosan-starch polymer was also produced following the procedure employed by Lozano-Navarro et al. [40]. The preparation of the 2% w/v chitosan (1% w/v acetic acid) and the 2% w/v starch solutions were carried out separately according to their respective protocols. Then, both suspensions were mixed together at 1:1 volume ratio after the starch suspension was tempered (pH 2.67). Glycerol 0.25% v/v was added and the mixture was subjected to agitation for 30 min, adding the extract halfway this time. The resulting solution was treated for 15 min with ultrasounds and kept for 35 min under\nFoods 2023, 12, 2977 4 of 23\nvacuum before being poured into the Petri dishes. The drying of the films was carried out for 72 h at room temperature. The volume of the filmogenic solution (5, 7.5, and 10 mL) and the MLE amount (1, 3, and 5% v/v) to be used for the film processing were investigated. Each formulation was manufactured at least four times to obtain enough films to carry out all the experiments. Those formulations were studied in order to determine the optimal composition, given that both the polymer solution volume and the amount of extract are important factors with regard to certain characteristics of the resulting film, such as gas and water vapor permeability, transparency, and other mechanical properties [25]. Moreover, the film thickness, which is largely dependent on the volume of liquid solution used, can have an impact on its mechanical strength, extract holding capacity, water vapor permeability, and transparency. Some of those parameters have been determined according to the procedure described in the following sections."

The study was performed using Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), to assess the effectiveness of the extract against different bacteria. Initially, a number of extract dilutions were prepared at concentrations of 93.75, 187.5, 375, 750, 1500, and 3000 \u00b5g/mL. Also, a bacterial inoculum in an LB medium of 1.5 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL was prepared and 100 \u00b5L of the same was poured into each well together with 10 \u00b5L of the extract at different concentrations.

First, this technique minimizes the amount of solvent used, which provides high-concentrated extracts that do not require concentration steps, reducing production costs [50]. Second, the inert atmosphere generates supercritical CO2, which avoids the oxidation of compounds. Third, it promotes the extraction of lipidic and other low-polar compounds that can facilitate plasticizing effect in the film-forming process, and finally, the low temperature used in the process avoids the loss of bioactivity of the extracts [51]. Taking all these benefits into consideration, ESE was employed to obtain a high bioactive MLE. The antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of MLE obtained by ESE have been previously reported in previous studies by the authors [27,35], and the bioactivity of the present extracts was within the same range as that determined in the present study (IC50 of 9.84 \u00b5g/mL extract and an AAI of 2.35 \u00b5g DPPH/\u00b5g).

Table 1 includes the thickness of the films obtained through each formulation together with its extract concentration, which was calculated considering the final weight of the films.\nFilm thickness can be a determinant of its mechanical strength, extract holding capacity, water vapor permeability, and transparency [35,36]. First, the films polymerized with any extract addition were analyzed. Compared to other films commonly used for food packaging, such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE), chitosan may lead to a higher tensile strength, although this may vary depending on the processing method [54]. However, the 5 mL films were too thin and possess poor polymerization; therefore, they were discarded for further analysis. On the other hand, the starch films presented a gelatinous, plastic texture, which imparts lack of mechanical resistance, which agrees with other authors [55]. In fact, the films made with 10 mL were discarded as they resulted in thick films with reliefs due to irregular drying. This higher moisture level causes an increase in the film weight and therefore a relative lower extract concentration per gram of film, compared to the other two formulations. Apart from those cases, the rest of the polymer formulation exhibited a correct polymerization and an apparent strength. The combination of both polymers, chitosan and starch, resulted in films with an appearance similar to that of chitosan to the naked eye, since probably this polymer has a predominant influence with regard to mechanical resistance. ANOVA tests were performed for thickness as a function of films and no significant differences were obtained (pCH = 0.078; pST = 0.086; pCH-ST = 0.069). Xu et al. [56] and Bourtoom and Bourtoom [57] concluded that the combined CH-ST films are more resistant to traction than those made from only one of these polymers. They also confirmed that there is a reaction between the hydroxyl groups (\u2212OH) in the ST polymers and the amino groups (\u2212NH2) in CH. From the point of view of the MLE concentration, the volume of filmogenic solution used on each of the compositions does not affect the final weight of the film, and the final concentration of extract calculated was not substantially varied on the three film formulations.

The only relevant differences were related to low %MLE in starch films, observing higher MLE release on the 5 mL films than from the 7.5 mL ones. On the other hand, the type of polymer seemed to be determinant with regard to the kinetic release of the extract, which in turn resulted in significant differences in their antioxidant activity levels. The releasing of the antioxidant compounds from ST films was greater and at a faster rate, obtaining a total DPPH reduction in the 5%MLE assays regardless of the filmogenic solution volume used (5 or 7.5 mL). It should be noted that the addition of plasticizers\u2014as MLE can actually act\u2014improve the flexibility of starch films by weakening the hydrogen bonds in their amylose and amylopectin chains [62], which in turn, may promote migration. On the other hand, the chitosan films showed a slower and lesser releasing of the extract, as it was less affected by the MLE addition, due to the presence of amino-charged groups promoting attraction forces between the chains [63], hindering the extract\u2019s release. We must bear in mind that chitosan films, either on their own or combined with ST, exhibit a considerable antioxidant capacity that may reach inhibition levels at around 6% over the reaction time studied, regardless of the volume used (Figure 4a,c). Therefore, in the case of blended films\u2014CH-ST-MLE (Figure 4c)\u2014although the kinetic reaction was governed by the presence of CH rather than by that of ST, they exhibited a slightly lower antioxidant activity than that of pure CH films. Tal\u00f3n et al., had observed the same behavior by CH-ST films when thymol extract was added to them, attributed to the lesser encapsulating capacity of the composed polymers [64]. In view of the results obtained from these analyses, the films selected for a further and deeper study on the rest of the properties were those produced using 7.5 mL polymer solution and 3% of MLE. This agrees with other studies, such as the one by Yang et al. [65], where the amount of thymol and carvacrol added was less than 10% in order to preserve the mechanical properties of a PLA-PBSA film. The antimicrobial activity of the MLE against E. coli and S. aureus have already been previously reported by other authors [66,67]. However, this bioactivity is altered when incorporated into active polymers, suffering a certain decrease due to the lower accessibility of the extract to the culture media [27,68]. Table 2 shows the antimicrobial capacity of those films against E. coli and S. aureus. As expected, the high antimicrobial capacity of CH films stood out from the rest of the films tested, which was evidenced both in the films composed exclusively of this polymer and the blend. The effect of the extract was evident in all the film formulations, but the most significant differences with respect to the control films corresponded to CH and CH-ST films, where the addition of MLE promoted the antimicrobial effect of chitosan on its own. On the other hand, the specific antimicrobial efficiency of MLE against these two microorganisms had already been reported by other studies in nanofibrillated cellulose-casting-films. The inhibition percentages registered were lower than those obtained in this study, which seems to indicate that bioactivity is enhanced when chitosan is used for the film formulation [27]. The effect on the MLE in the ST films is not so clear, since although their inhibition capacity was higher in the presence of the extract, the ST control films on their own exhibited a certain level of inhibition itself. It could be possible that the high solubility of the ST films in aqueous media (Figure 4a) could interfere with the absorbance measurement, hindering the antimicrobial effect of MLE."

This kind of food, such as fruit or vegetables, is sometimes packed after being peeled or cut into pieces, which results in the exudation of a considerable amount of water that may affect the mechanical resistance of the packaging material. Although the addition of the extract had a filling effect that reduced the solubility of this polymer in all the cases, the high solubility of the ST films was still rather noticeable, which can be a considerable limitation with regard to their practical application of ST as a food packaging film [9]. Based on all of the above said, together with the description of its functional properties in Section 3.3, this formulation was discarded as inadequate for the food packaging-intended purposes of our study. The results on solubility match with the water permeability assays (Figure 4b), where the decrease in WVP was similarly enhanced either by the mixture of the polymers or by the addition of the extract. This behavior had already been observed by Hern\u00e1ndez et al. [11] who attributed this reduction in WVP to a greater stiffness of the film and an increased hydrophobicity resulting from the addition of the extract. This is a factor to be considered when it comes to fresh food packaging, since a greater water permeability of the film may, on the one hand, prevent the loss of moisture from the packed fruit or vegetables, but on the other hand, this higher moisture level may lead to the growth of molds. Light barrier is another parameter of importance for the preservation of oxidationsensitive foods. As can be seen in Figure 4c, the control films proved to be a good barrier against the short wavelengths (\u03bb < 320 nm) of UV light, with zero transmittance within that spectral region. In a study by Bangyekan et al. [71], it was reported that chitosan films exhibited higher transmittance than starch films, which agrees with the results obtained from our assays, where the CH-ST films offered a more efficient barrier against UV and against the visible light spectrum than the CH films. In the case of the control films\u2014 without MLE\u2014their differences regarding the transmittance of light became smaller at the higher end of the visible spectral region, where the two formulations presented rather similar transmittance levels. In the case of MLE-added films, this protection extended to the end of the UV region (400 nm) in both formulations. As expected, the extract, by darkening the films, reduced their transmittance, improving blocking throughout the UV-Vis range. This agrees with the data reported by other authors regarding the development of edible chitosan film with the addition of grape seed extract added [72] and curcumin extract [47]. Therefore, biodegradable MLE-added CH or CH-ST films have the capacity to absorb UV radiation at a better rate than their respective controls, and therefore they can prevent the oxidation of photosensitive foods [73]. Even so, both control and MLE-added films showed lower protection in the visible region than in the ultraviolet one."

            "text": "The formulation of active polymers for the packaging and preservation of food entails a broad study of the film properties from physical and bioactive perspectives. In this study, some of the factors that may affect the effectiveness of active packaging materials have been studied. For this purpose, CH, ST, and CH-ST films have been added to MLE at different concentrations. Increasing amounts of MLE provided better protection against UV and enhanced antioxidant activity, even if just adding 3% MLE to the different formulations was enough to obtain homogeneous films with good physical integrity and bioactive properties. The ST films released large amounts of MLE into the DPPH reagent, while the CH and CH-ST films tended to retain the MLE compounds, decreasing its release. Nevertheless, the antimicrobial action on the liquid culture media was substantially greater in the CH and CH-ST films because the endogenous antimicrobial effect of this agent promotes the bioactivity of the MLE. So, all in all, the bioactivity of the polymers was guaranteed. The composition of the food to be preserved, and particularly its water content, is a factor to be considered in bio-based polymers, since it may affect the film resistance. In fact, the ST films exhibited quite a high solubility in water that could affect their integrity in the long term. Depending on the mode of action of the polymer, its preservative effect can also be developed in the headspace of the package, which would affect packaging requirements. In this sense, the results obtained from the VOC migration study on the selected films (CH 3%MLE and CH-ST 3%MLE) confirmed the presence of the VOCs from the MLE in the headspace of the package. This migration of VOCs from the MLE into the headspace presented different profiles depending on the polymer type used, which may also represent another factor to consider with regard to food preservation. Furthermore, the superior preservation efficiency (over 10%) of the bioactive films compared to that of the non-active ones makes us think that the VOCs released into the HS exert a certain antimicrobial action, given that the film packaging method did not involve the vacuum sealing of the package and therefore, the film was not in tight contact with the food. This study provides interesting results for the control of influential factors in the manufacture of active packaging with biodegradable films, as well as its potential in food preservation, based on the results obtained in real food. The reduction in waste of highly perishable and high-cost products, such as raspberries, can lead to economic savings for producers and consumers.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/foods12152977/s1, Figure S1: CIELAB coordinates of CH (A) and ST (B) films manufactured using different volumes (\u2206: 5 mL; #: 7.5 mL; \u2666: 10 mL) and MLE percentages.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.C. and M.F.; methodology, C.C. and M.F.; validation, L.C. and C.M.; formal analysis, I.R.; investigation, C.C. and L.C.; data curation, C.C. and M.F.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, C.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.F. and L.C.; supervision, L.C.; project administration, C.M.; funding acquisition, C.M.
