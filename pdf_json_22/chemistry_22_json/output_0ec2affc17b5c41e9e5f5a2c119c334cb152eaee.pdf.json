    "abstractText": "This case highlights the challenges associated with measuring FT4 and reinforces the need to interpret clinical laboratory test results in the context of patient symptoms. Rather than rushing to initiate antithyroid medication in an asymptomatic patient with repeatedly elevated FT4 values, the care team correctly suspected an error and investigated further. This investigation is particularly challenging for free hormone assays as dilution disrupts the free:bound equilibrium, eliminating it from the laboratorian\u2019s troubleshooting tool kit. The authors appropriately chose to repeat FT4 measurement on a different assay platform to evaluate the presence of an assay-specific interfering substance. When the second immunoassay also generated a higher than expected result, a variant T4-binding protein affecting both assays was suspected. Measurement of FT4 is inherently difficult as it represents 0.03% of circulating T4 and requires carefully designed assay reagents to minimally alter the free: bound equilibrium. Because automated FT4 immunoassays use a competitive format, decreased signal intensity is assumed to reflect the displacement of T4 in the assay reagent by endogenous free hormone. This assumption is valid when the patient\u2019s thyroid hormone\u2013binding characteristics are similar to those of the assay calibrators. However, variant albumin with increased T4-binding affinity likely sequesters a disproportionately higher amount of exogenous reagent T4, resulting in low signal and falsely high reported values. As the authors demonstrate, different assay platforms exhibit differing degrees of susceptibility to albumin variants, with the observed effect dependent on the specific assay chemistries. It is also important to note that interassay variability is not limited to immunoassays: some equilibrium dialysis-mass spectrometry assays generate FT4 values within the reference interval in euthyroid familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia patients while others generate falsely high results (1). This further emphasizes the need to interpret values with caution when inconsistent with the patient\u2019s clinical presentation, even when using gold standard reference methods.",
