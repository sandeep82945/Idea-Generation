    "abstractText": "Background Ventilator\u2010induced lung injury (VILI) is caused by overdistension of the alveoli by the repetitive recruit\u2010 ment and derecruitment of alveolar units. This study aims to investigate the potential role and mechanism of fibro\u2010 blast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a metabolic regulator secreted by the liver, in VILI development. Methods Serum FGF21 concentrations were determined in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia and in a mouse VILI model. Lung injury was compared between FGF21\u2010knockout (KO) mice and wild\u2010type (WT) mice. Recombinant FGF21 was administrated in vivo and in vitro to determine its therapeutic effect. Results Serum FGF21 levels in patients and mice with VILI were significantly higher than in those without VILI. Additionally, the increment of serum FGF21 in anesthesia patients was positively correlated with the duration of ventilation. VILI was aggravated in FGF21\u2010KO mice compared with WT mice. Conversely, the administration of FGF21 alleviated VILI in both mouse and cell models. FGF21 reduced Caspase\u20101 activity, suppressed the mRNA levels of Nlrp3, Asc, Il-1\u03b2, Il-18, Hmgb1 and Nf-\u03bab, and decreased the protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u201018, HMGB1 and the cleaved form of GSDMD. Conclusions Our findings reveal that endogenous FGF21 signaling is triggered in response to VILI, which protects against VILI by inhibiting the NLRP3/Caspase\u20101/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway. These results suggest that boosting endogenous FGF21 or the administration of recombinant FGF21 could be promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of VILI during anesthesia or critical care.",

Lung injury was compared between FGF21\u2011knockout (KO) mice and wild\u2011type (WT) mice. Recombinant FGF21 was administrated in vivo and in vitro to determine its therapeutic effect.\nResults Serum FGF21 levels in patients and mice with VILI were significantly higher than in those without VILI. Additionally, the increment of serum FGF21 in anesthesia patients was positively correlated with the duration of ventilation. VILI was aggravated in FGF21\u2011KO mice compared with WT mice. Conversely, the administration of FGF21 alleviated VILI in both mouse and cell models. FGF21 reduced Caspase\u20111 activity, suppressed the mRNA levels of Nlrp3, Asc, Il-1\u03b2, Il-18, Hmgb1 and Nf-\u03bab, and decreased the protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, IL\u20111\u03b2, IL\u201118, HMGB1 and the cleaved form of GSDMD.\nConclusions Our findings reveal that endogenous FGF21 signaling is triggered in response to VILI, which protects against VILI by inhibiting the NLRP3/Caspase\u20111/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway. These results suggest that boosting endogenous FGF21 or the administration of recombinant FGF21 could be promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of VILI during anesthesia or critical care.\nKeywords Ventilator\u2011induced lung injury, Fibroblast growth factor 21, Pyroptosis, NLRP3, Caspase\u20111, Gasdermin D\n\u2020Peng Ding, Rui Yang, Cheng Li contributed equally.\n*Correspondence: Yan\u2011Fei Mao maoyanfei@xinhuamed.com.cn Hong\u2011Bin Yuan jfjczyy@aliyun.com Yong\u2011Hua Li liyonghua1207@smmu.edu.cn Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

            "text": "Mechanical ventilation (MV) is an important component of general anesthesia and an indispensable respiratory support therapy for critically ill patients. However, MV can cause lung injury, namely ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which predisposes patients to inflammatory response syndrome or multiple organ failure with a mortality rate of nearly 50% [1], making it an urgent clinical problem to be solved. The primary causes of VILI are mechanical power and the duration of ventilator exposure [2]. Current studies suggest that VILI is not only a mechanical trauma but also a biotrauma, which activates a complex signaling cascade in the lung [3, 4]. Small tidal volumes and low airway pressures may reduce the morbidity and mortality of VILI [5]. In addition to canonical inflammation-related molecules including innate immune cytokines and chemokines [6], the permeabilityoriginating obstruction response in which alveolar leakage leads to surfactant dysfunction and increases local tissue stresses also plays a critical role in VILI [7]. Thus, it is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanism of VILI and develop new preventive/therapeutic interventions.\nFibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of structurally related proteins with diverse biological functions during embryonic development, tissue injury/repair, tumorigenesis, and metabolic homeostasis. To date, 23 members of the FGF family have been identified, all of which are referred to as \u201cpluripotent\u201d growth factors and as \u201cpromiscuous\u201d growth factors due to their multiple actions on a wide range of cell types. FGF21, a member of the FGFs, was first identified and cloned in 2000 [8]. FGF21 is highly expressed in the liver and can be secreted into the blood [9]. Numerous clinical and basic studies have shown that FGF21 is involved in metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [10\u201312]. Interestingly, FGF21 has been reported to be involved in lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury [13], and the emerging roles of FGF21 in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and other critical diseases are increasingly noteworthy [14]. Moreover, several FGF21 analogs, such as Pegbelfermin (BristolMyers Squibb), LY2405319 (Eli Lilly), and PF05231023 (Pfizer), have passed Phase I/II trials and were reported to be generally well tolerated and effective in treating obesity or diabetes [15\u201317].\nCurrently, there is no knowledge regarding the roles of FGF21 in VILI. We hypothesized that FGF21, which is able to protect the blood\u2013brain barrier and reduce inflammation [18, 19], may play a role in the development and progression of VILI and, if so, further explore the underlying molecular mechanism."

Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Biomedicine of Naval Medical University. Patients with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation under general anesthesia aged 45\u201370\u00a0 years, and ASA status I\u2013II were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included: severe lung, liver or renal dysfunction, severe infection, malignancy, type 2 diabetes, obese patients (BMI > 30\u00a0 kg/m2), estimated intraoperative blood loss > 500\u00a0ml, and estimated ventilation duration less than 2\u00a0h.\nAfter the patient entered the operating room, electrocardiogram monitoring was established and radial artery catheterization was performed. Five milliliters of blood was drawn through the arterial catheter and injected into a coagulation-promoting tube, which was left at room temperature for 30\u00a0 min and then centrifuged at 3000\u00a0 g for 10\u00a0 min. Serum was collected and stored at \u2212 80\u00a0 \u00b0C. The patients were routinely subjected to endotracheal intubation and intravenous-inhalation combined anesthesia. The ventilation parameters were set as follows: volume-controlled ventilation mode, 8\u201310\u00a0 ml/kg tidal volume, 12 breaths/minute, 1:2 inspiration/expiration ratio, 3\u20135\u00a0cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure, and 60\u2013100% inhalation oxygen concentration. At the end of the operation and before extubation, 5\u00a0 ml of arterial blood was extracted, and serum was collected and stored in the same way. Two tubes of serum were collected from each patient before and after mechanical ventilation. If hemolysis or lipid clots occurred in any tube of serum, the pair of samples were discarded, and the patient was excluded. Serum levels of FGF21 were measured by an ELISA kit (ab222506, Abcam, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions."

All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Biomedicine of Naval Medical\nUniversity, were performed in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were reported in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting In\u00a0 Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines 2.0 [20].\nThe mice were fasted for 12\u00a0 h before the experiment. After anesthetization by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100\u00a0mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u00a0mg/kg), the mice were intubated orally with a 22-G catheter and then connected to a small animal-specific ventilator (VentElite, Harvard Apparatus, USA) and placed on a warm pad. The mice were ventilated with a tidal volume of 30\u00a0ml/kg at 70 breaths/min for 4\u00a0h [21], and control mice underwent intubation but breathed spontaneously. After the modeling, the mice were resuscitated and kept for 24\u00a0h; then, the mice were killed for subsequent experiments.\nPrimary cell culture and\u00a0cyclic mechanical stretch Primary lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMEVCs) were extracted from male neonatal C57BL/6N mice (3\u00a0 days old) using a tissue block attachment method (Additional file\u00a0 1: Supplementary content). Complete ECM medium (ScienCell, USA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% triple antibiotics, and endothelial cell growth factors was used. Cells were identified by immunocytochemistry with the endothelial marker CD31. Third-generation LMVECs were inoculated into a 6-well Bioflex plate (Flexcell, USA). Cells were subjected to cyclic mechanical stretch (MS) in the Flexcell FX-5000 system using the following parameters: 0.5\u00a0Hz (30 times/ minute); 20% max elongation; 4-h duration. After modeling, the cells were treated with rFGF21 or phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), transferred to a conventional incubator (37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO2), and cultured for 24\u00a0h before subsequent experiments."

When these patients were divided into two subgroups based on the duration of ventilation (< 4\u00a0 h and > 4\u00a0 h), we found a more pronounced increase in the latter group: the mean serum FGF21 level increased from 154.9 \u00b1 11.4\u00a0 pg/ml to 175.5 \u00b1 13.3\u00a0 pg/ml in patients with MV < 4\u00a0 h (Fig.\u00a0 1B), while it increased from 151.1 \u00b1 11.4\u00a0pg/ml to 204.4 \u00b1 15.0\u00a0pg/ml in patients with MV > 4\u00a0 h (Fig.\u00a0 1C).

Serum FGF21 levels in VILI mice at 24\u00a0 h or 48\u00a0 h after MV were significantly higher than those in the control mice (Fig.\u00a0 1E). We also examined FGF21 protein expression in the liver and lung tissue of mice with VILI and found that FGF21 protein expression was barely detectable in the lung but was expressed abundantly in the liver. Moreover, hepatic FGF21 protein levels were upregulated by VILI (Fig.\u00a0 1F). IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, two proinflammatory cytokines, were induced by MV (Fig.\u00a01G&H).

            "text": "We next used a mouse strain with global knockout of FGF21 to examine the pathophysiological role of FGF21 in VILI (Fig.\u00a0 2A). Using immunoblotting, we confirmed the deficiency of FGF21 in KO mice (Fig.\u00a0 2B). H&E staining showed that there were no abnormalities in the unventilated lung tissues of KO mice and WT mice. However, VILI pathologies, including pulmonary edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, were evident\nin WT mice and more pronounced in KO mice (Fig.\u00a02C). TUNEL staining showed that the number of TUNEL+ cells was increased by VILI in WT mice and, to a great extent, in KO mice (Fig.\u00a0 2D). We used H&E staining to assess the number of cells in BALF and found that the number of total cells in the BALF of KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice in the VILI model (Fig.\u00a0 2E), most of which were neutrophils (Fig.\u00a0 2F). We also measured MPO activity, which is a marker of neutrophils, and found that FGF21 knockout further promoted MPO activity in the context of VILI (Fig.\u00a0 2G). BALF protein levels were induced by VILI and were more pronounced in KO mice (Fig.\u00a02H), suggesting that FGF21 gene knockout aggravated pulmonary microvascular barrier disruption during VILI. The results of the wet/dry ratio of lung tissue and Evans blue staining demonstrated that vascular barrier permeability was damaged by VILI in WT mice and, to a great extent, in FGF21-KO mice (Fig.\u00a0 2I&J). These aggravated VILI-related pulmonary pathologies in FGF21-KO mice indicate that endogenous FGF21 may be a protective factor in VILI.\nFGF21 treatment alleviates VILI in\u00a0mice To further validate the therapeutic effect of FGF21, we administered mouse-origin recombinant FGF21 (rFGF21) in a mouse VILI model. H&E staining showed that ventilation-induced damages, including massive inflammatory cell infiltration, severe interstitial edema, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, were found alleviated in groups with mid- and high doses of rFGF21. In contrast, a low dose of rFGF21 failed to protect against VILI (Fig.\u00a0 3A). Similar dose-dependent therapeutic effects were observed by TUNEL staining (Fig.\u00a03B). H&E staining showed that the number of total cells as well as neutrophils in BALF was decreased significantly after rFGF21 administration, suggesting that FGF21 may play a role in reducing the infiltration and exudation of proinflammatory cells in the lung (Fig.\u00a03C and D). Evans blue accumulation was enhanced in VILI mice and reduced by rFGF21 (Fig.\u00a03E). Accordingly, the protein content in BALF increased significantly after VILI but decreased significantly in all FGF21-treated groups (Fig.\u00a0 3F). The increased W/D ratio of the lung was also reduced in FGF21-treated groups (Fig.\u00a0 3G). These results suggest that FGF21 alleviates microvascular barrier damage and\npulmonary edema in a dose-dependent manner. We next determined oxidative stress in lung tissues. MPO activity induced by VILI was significantly decreased by rFGF21 treatment (Fig.\u00a0 3H). The decrease in total antioxidant capacity, which was evaluated by Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), was reversed by rFGF21 treatment (Fig.\u00a0 3I). Moreover, rFGF21 treatment restored the ATP levels in the mitochondrial fraction of lung tissue from VILI mice (Fig.\u00a0 3J). These results suggest that FGF21 might be able to alleviate VILI in mice.\nFGF21 treatment reduces endothelial injury and\u00a0downregulates pulmonary interstitial pro\u2011fibrosis factors Next, we evaluated endothelial injury and pulmonary interstitial changes in a VILI mouse model. In\u00a0situ immunofluorescence staining of VE-cadherin, a marker of endothelial junctions, clearly showed that the VE-cadherin fluorescence intensity in the microvessels of intact blood-perfused lungs was significantly decreased after MV. However, FGF21 treatment attenuated the decline of VE-cadherin fluorescence intensity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a04A). We also detected pulmonary interstitial fibrosis tendency by immunofluorescence staining of pro-fibrosis factors \u03b1-SMA and vimentin. The result showed that \u03b1-SMA was induced in lung tissues by MV, and this effect was partially prevented by mid- and high doses of rFGF21 (Fig.\u00a04B). Immunofluorescence staining of vimentin showed that the three doses of rFGF21 efficiently suppressed MV-induced vimentin expression in lung tissue (Fig.\u00a0 4C). These results indicate that FGF21 treatment protects against MV-induced endothelial injury and inhibits pro-fibrosis factors.\nFGF21 treatment ameliorates MS\u2011induced injury in\u00a0a\u00a0cell model FGF21 can impact whole-body metabolism and biological functions through multiple mechanisms, including endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effects [25]. To clarify how FGF21 protects against VLLI in cellular level, we established a mechanical stretch model in cultured primary LMVECs, in which FGFR1, the major receptor of FGF21, was highly expressed (Fig.\u00a0 5A). Cell viability was decreased significantly by cyclic MS stress and was partially restored by FGF21\nFig. 3 FGF21 treatment alleviates VILI in mice. A.

The levels of LDH in the culture medium were examined to determine cell integrity. We observed that the LDH content in the culture medium was increased significantly by MS, whereas rFGF21 treatment reduced this change (Fig.\u00a0 5C). We also evaluated oxidative stress in this cell model. Intracellular ROS levels were determined by a DCFH-DA probe. Cyclic MS stress significantly induced ROS levels in LMVECs, while rFGF21 treatment inhibited ROS production (Fig.\u00a0 5D). The TEAC assay results showed that FGF21 rescued the impaired antioxidant capacity induced by MS stress in LMEVCs (Fig.\u00a0 5E). The activity of SOD, an important antioxidant enzyme, was decreased significantly by MS and was restored by FGF21 treatment (Fig.\u00a0 5F). Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported to play a key role in the pathophysiology of VILI [26]. We also measured the influence of rFGF21 on mitochondrial dysfunction in the cell model. Intracellular ATP levels were dramatically reduced by MS stress, but were rescued by\nrFGF21 (Fig.\u00a0 5G). Mitochondrial membrane potential was examined by immunofluorescent staining. The cells underwent MS stress exhibited an obvious increase in Annexin immunofluorescence (green) and a decrease in mitochondrion immunofluorescence (red), which was largely inhibited by rFGF21 (Fig.\u00a05H). These results indicate that FGF21 ameliorates cellular injury, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in a cell model of mechanical stretch.\nFGF21 protects against\u00a0VILI by\u00a0inhibiting the\u00a0NLRP3/ Caspase\u20111/GSDMD pyroptotic pathway Next, we sought to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of FGF21 on VILI. Pyroptosis, which is a form of programmed cell death, is critically involved in acute lung injury and VILI [27, 28]. Previously, pyroptosis was believed to be mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome [29]; currently, pore formation in the cell membrane mediated by gasdermin (GSDM) proteins, especially caspase-1 cleaved GSDMD [30], is thought to be the crucial characteristic of pyroptosis. We examined the activity of caspase-1 in the lung tissues and found that caspase-1 activity was triggered (~ fourfold) in VILI model mice, while the administration of rFGF21 abolished this change (Fig.\u00a06A). The mRNA levels of pyroptotic factors, including Nlrp3, Asc, Casp1 and Gsdmd, increased significantly in VILI mouse\u2019s lung tissue (Fig.\u00a06B). Accordingly, the mRNA levels of Il-1\u03b2 and Il-18, two proinflammatory factors released by pyroptotic cells, were enhanced by VILI but suppressed by rFGF21 treatment (Fig.\u00a0 6C). Similar changes in high mobility group protein 1 (Hmgb1), a delivery protein of pyroptosis [31], were observed (Fig.\u00a06D). Gene expression of the proinflammatory factors Nf-\u03bab and Rela was also induced by VILI and inhibited by rFGF21 (Fig.\u00a06E).\nWe further examined the influence of FGF21 on the protein expression of pyroptotic factors. Similar to the changes in mRNA levels, the protein levels of NLRP3 and ASC were significantly upregulated in VILI mice, and this effect was prevented by FGF21 treatment (Fig.\u00a06F). Total caspase-1 was slightly induced by VILI, while cleaved caspase-1, the activated form of caspase-1, was markedly induced by VILI, and FGF21 treatment successfully suppressed this change (Fig.\u00a06F). Mature IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2Asp117 were significantly induced in the lung tissue of VILI mice and were attenuated by rFGF21 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a06G). A similar change in HMGB1 was observed (Fig.\u00a06G). Finally, we examined the cleavage of GSDMD. Obvious cleavage of GSDMD was noted in the lung tissue of VILI mice, which was partially blocked by rFGF21 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a06H). These results suggest that the protective effect of FGF21 might be associated with the inhibition of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptotic pathway."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The pathogenesis of VILI is multifactorial and complex, resulting predominantly from interactions between ventilator-related factors and patient-related factors. In the present study, we provided evidence that circulating levels of FGF21 were increased in both patients and mice with longtime mechanical ventilation. Using a mouse strain with FGF21 deficiency, we demonstrated that VILI\npathologies were further aggravated by FGF21 deletion, suggesting that FGF21 may be an endogenous mechanism in response to VILI stimuli. Moreover, we showed that the administration of FGF21 successfully ameliorated VILI in a mouse model and rescued mechanical stretch-induced injury in a cell model. Mechanistically, we found that inhibiting the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptotic pathway may contribute to the protective effect of FGF21 against VILI.\nThe first interesting finding is that FGF21 is induced after VILI, and we speculated that the elevated circulating FGF21 might be mainly synthesized and secreted by the liver. Previous studies have shown significantly elevated levels of FGF21 in patients with type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver and obesity [32, 33]. In addition, circulating FGF21 was increased in response to cardiac stress [34], ischemic stroke [35], limb ischemia/reperfusion injury [36], and toxic kidney injury [37]. We found that serum FGF21 tended to increase and peaked at approximately 24\u00a0 h after VILI modeling in mice, which was reported for the first time. It is reported in some public databases that FGF21 is not expressed in normal lung tissues or lung cells (Additional file\u00a01: Fig.\u00a0S4), and we also found that FGF21 was enriched in the lung after systemic administration of recombinant FGF21 (Additional file\u00a01: Fig.\u00a0S4). These findings supported the hypothesis that exogenous rFGF21 was enriched in the lung after rFGF21 medication. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that endogenous FGF21 might be triggered after mechanical ventilation. As this preliminary conclusion is based on only one single time point after medication, further studies on pharmacology and pharmacokinetic profiles of rFGF21 may be needed in the future.\nWe also report for the first time that VILI is more severe in FGF21-knockout mice, suggesting that endogenous FGF21 may be a protective factor. In addition to results from the loss-of-function of FGF21, we further explored the therapeutic effect of recombinant FGF21 and the results were supportive. As some FGF21-related candidate drugs, such as FGF21 analogs (Pegbelfermin, LY2405319, PF05231023) have been clinically tested to treat diabetes and other metabolic disorders, our findings strongly suggest that testing the efficacy of these FGF21 analogs in patients at high risk of VILI may be necessary.\nThe FGF receptor family includes FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, and an FGFR-like protein-FGFR5 [38], among which FGFR1 is abundantly expressed in fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, respiratory ciliated cells, and endothelial cells in the lung (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig.\u00a0 S5). We knockdown FGFR1 by small interfering RNA and found that the protective effect of FGF21 was attenuated, indicating that FGFR1 plays a key role in mediating the biological function of FGF21 (Additional file\u00a0 1:\nFig.\u00a0S6). These findings may help to explain the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective role of FGF21 in the lung, and further study on the specific ligand\u2013receptor interaction and signal transduction process is still needed.\nOxidative stress is an important link in the pathophysiological development of lung injury. During MV, alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells produce large amounts of ROS in response to cyclic stretch and shear forces [39]. Mitochondria are the most important sites of ROS production. Under oxidative stress, ROS overload leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased ATP synthesis capacity, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced scavenging free radical capacity, leading to a further increase in ROS and forming a vicious cycle [40]. When there is an imbalance between high levels of ROS and antioxidant capacity, cells are unable to maintain normal redox homeostasis, leading to cellular damage and inflammatory responses [41]. Kang et\u00a0 al. [42] found that FGF21 could reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress by regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway and the AMPK/AKT pathway in an aged diabetic mouse model. Zhang et\u00a0al. [43] found that FGF21 had a therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis by activating the Nrf-2 pathway and thus inhibiting oxidative stress and extracellular matrix deposition. Our findings are in line with these results and indicate that FGF21 inhibits the increase in ROS production, restores the antioxidant capacity of cells, and stabilizes the membrane potential and function of mitochondria.\nAdditionally, we found an association between FGF21 and pyroptosis. Pyroptosis, which is a form of lytic cell death, plays a vital role in innate immune; however, aberrant pyroptosis can contribute to injury in multiple organs. The activation of caspase-1 triggers pyroptosis, and GSDMD leads to pore formation, resulting in the cleavage of inflammatory cytokines [44]. Since caspase-1 plays a central role in inducing pyroptosis and the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis has been well studied, it is possible to reduce pyroptosis by regulating NLRP3. Wei et\u00a0al. [45] reported that FGF21 improved intimal hyperplasia in diabetic mice, which was associated with inhibition of the FGFR1/Syk/NLRP3 pathway. Chen et\u00a0al. [46] showed that FGF21 inhibited pyroptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by suppressing ROS production. In our study, we found that the induced mRNA levels of NLRP3 inflammasome, the protein expression of IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2, and the cleavage of GSDMD were all inhibited by FGF21 treatment. Therefore, our results indicate a critical role of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptotic pathway in the pathophysiology of VILI, which is consistent with two recently published works [47, 48], and further point out a potential therapeutic effect of FGF21\nagainst VILI-related pyroptosis. However, the regulatory mechanisms of FGF21 on pyroptosis, especially in VILI, may need further investigation.\nAs mentioned above, the liver is a major manufacturer of FGF21, and we hypothesized that elevated circulating FGF21 is secreted by the liver. However, how the liver responds to volutrauma/biotrauma in the lung and whether this is a causal or correlation relationship is poorly understood. It may be the effect of specific cytokines or mediators released by the lung or through neurohumoral regulation. We believe that screening signaling molecules relating to the cross talk between the lung and the liver after mechanical ventilation using systemic methods (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) might be a promising approach to answer this conundrum.\nThere are several limitations in this study. First, only male mice were used in this study for concerns about confounding contributions from the hormone cycle in female mice since our research target is also a circulating hormone. In addition, some studies reported the sex difference in metabolic responses and pharmacological effects of FGF21 [49, 50], while gender differences in lung injury are rarely reported. Whether FGF21 benefits VILI both in male and in female is an intriguing question meriting further investigation. Second, the experimental design lacked a group of mice ventilated with normal tidal volume. The tidal volume of 30\u00a0 ml/kg is classic in mouse model while exceeds what would be used in any clinical setting. It will be helpful in the clinical translation of the findings if regular ventilated mice were tested in future study."
