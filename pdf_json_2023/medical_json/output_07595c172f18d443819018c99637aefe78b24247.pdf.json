    "abstractText": "Introduction: Treatment satisfaction in diabetes management is vital to achieving longterm clinical outcomes. This analysis evaluated treatment satisfaction among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) after 52 weeks of treatment with once-weekly tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) compared with dulaglutide 0.75 mg. Methods: This exploratory analysis of the phase 3 SURPASS J-mono trial assessed treatment satisfaction using the Japanese translation of the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status (DTSQs) and change versions (DTSQc). Subgroup analyses were post hoc and conducted for the DTSQc overall treatment satisfaction score based on age (\\65 or C 65 years), sex (male or female), baseline body mass index (BMI;\\ 25 or C 25 kg/m), and baseline glycated hemoglobin (B 8.5% or [8.5%). Results: Baseline DTSQs scores were similar among patients across all treatment arms. Overall, trends showed higher satisfaction among patients who received any tirzepatide dose compared with those who received dulaglutide after 52 weeks of treatment. Mean overall DTSQc treatment satisfaction scores at week 52 were significantly higher with tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg versus dulaglutide 0.75 mg (11.5, 12.1, and 12.3, respectively, vs 8.9; P\\ 0.001). The DTSQc perceived frequency scores for unacceptable hyperglycemia were significantly lower with tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg versus dulaglutide 0.75 mg (1.7, 1.8, and 2.3, respectively, vs 0.6; P\\0.001), while scores for unacceptable hypoglycemia were similar across all treatment arms, ranging from 0.8 to 1.1. Subgroup analyses showed increased treatment satisfaction with tirzepatide compared with dulaglutide in the \\65 years (P\\0.001) and baseline BMI C 25 kg/m subgroups (P\\ 0.01 or \\0.001) and similar treatment satisfaction across treatment arms in the C 65 years and BMI\\25 kg/m subgroups. Conclusion: Patients with T2D reported higher treatment satisfaction with once-weekly tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) compared with dulaglutide 0.75 mg after 52 weeks of treatment.

            "text": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a long-term condition that requires daily management of blood glucose levels, with the goal of maintaining quality of life and life expectancy at a level comparable to that of healthy individuals by preventing the onset and progression of serious complications [1]. The importance of treatment satisfaction in diabetes management is well reported and vital to achieving long-term clinical outcomes [2\u20135].\nThe Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (status version; DTSQs) is a patientreported outcome (PRO) tool used to assess patients\u2019 satisfaction with their diabetes treatment, which includes questions related to perceived frequencies of unacceptable hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia [6, 7]. The DTSQ has been widely translated, including in Japanese [8], and is internationally validated and officially approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Diabetes Federation [9]. The DTSQ change version (DTSQc) is used to assess a patient\u2019s change in treatment satisfaction relative to a predefined time point (e.g., at the start of a clinical trial) rather than absolute treatment satisfaction [10]. Findings from numerous studies that have measured differences in the DTSQs and DTSQc between treatments suggest meaningful and clinically relevant distinctions [2, 11].\nTirzepatide is a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for the treatment of T2D in the USA, Europe, and Japan [12\u201314] and is under investigation for chronic weight management. The global phase 3 SURPASS clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg), either as monotherapy or in addition to other antihyperglycemic medications, results in clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control and body weight reduction in patients with T2D [15\u201319]. Two phase 3 clinical trials conducted in Japan (SURPASS J-mono and SURPASS J-combo) demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in patients with T2D [20, 21]. SURPASS J-mono compared the efficacy\nand safety of once-weekly tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) with dulaglutide 0.75 mg, a once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist. After 52 weeks of treatment, tirzepatide was superior to dulaglutide and demonstrated dose-dependent and statistically significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; mean reduction of - 2.4% to - 2.8% vs - 1.3% with dulaglutide) and body weight (mean reduction of - 7.8% to - 13.9% vs - 0.7% with dulaglutide) [21]. To expand on these findings and how they relate to patients\u2019 treatment experience, this exploratory evaluation of the SURPASS J-mono trial aimed to assess treatment satisfaction among Japanese patients with T2D using the DTSQ."

The study methods and main outcomes of the trial have been previously published [21]. In brief, participants were Japanese adults aged C 20 years with a T2D diagnosis (WHO classification); were na\u0131\u0308ve to oral antihyperglycemic medication (OAM) or receiving OAM monotherapy (with the exception of thiazolidinedione) and willing to discontinue the OAM during an 8-week washout period; and had a stable weight (\u00b1 5%) for at least 3 months prior to visit 1, a body mass index (BMI) C 23 kg/m2 at visit 1, and an HbA1c C 7.0% to B 10.0% at visits 1 and 2 (for OAM-na\u0131\u0308ve patients) or C 6.5% to B 9.0% at visit 1 and C 7.0% to B 10.0% at visit 2 (for patients discontinuing OAM). Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or a history of any injectable therapy use for T2D, acute or chronic pancreatitis, acute or chronic hepatitis, or diabetic retinopathy requiring acute treatment.\nThe study was approved by an independent ethical review board at each site and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1964 and its later amendments and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences international ethical guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent before study participation. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03861052)."

            "text": "Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg or dulaglutide 0.75 mg. Randomization was stratified on the basis of patients\u2019 baseline HbA1c (B 8.5% or [ 8.5%), baseline BMI (\\25 or C 25 kg/m2), and need for OAM washout (yes or no). The study comprised a 4-week (for OAMna\u0131\u0308ve patients) or 10-week (C 8-week washout for patients discontinuing OAM) screening/ lead-in period, followed by a 52-week treatment period and a 4-week safety follow-up period. During the treatment period, patients received tirzepatide or dulaglutide once weekly by subcutaneous injection. The tirzepatide dose was initiated at 2.5 mg, increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached, and then maintained for the remainder of treatment.\nTreatment satisfaction was a secondary outcome of the trial and was assessed using the Japanese translation of the DTSQ [8]. Two DTSQ versions were used to assess treatment satisfaction: the DTSQs at baseline and the DTSQc at weeks 40 and 52 and in cases of early termination [9, 10].\nThe DTSQ is a self-administered PRO instrument comprising eight items, which are conceptually similar for the DTSQs and DTSQc versions. Each item of the DTSQs is assessed on a 7-point Likert scale (0 to 6). For six of the eight items (items 1 [satisfaction with current treatment], 4 [convenience], 5 [flexibility], 6 [understanding of diabetes], 7 [recommend treatment to others], and 8 [willingness to continue]), scores range from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied) [6]. These scores are\nsummed to provide a composite measure of overall treatment satisfaction, ranging from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Items 2 and 3 of the DTSQs are used to individually measure the perceived frequency of unacceptable hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively, with scores ranging from 0 (none of the time) to 6 (most of the time). The DTSQc has different response options from those of the DTSQs to produce a measure of the change from baseline in satisfaction rather than absolute satisfaction [10]. Each item of the DTSQc assesses change from baseline on a 7-point scale. Scores for DTSQc item 1 and items 4 to 8 range from - 3 (much less now) to ? 3 (much more now), with overall treatment satisfaction scores (sum of scores on item 1 and items 4 through 8) ranging from - 18 to ? 18 (higher scores represent greater satisfaction). Possible DTSQc scores for items 2 and 3 (perceived frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively) range from - 3 (much less of the time now) to ? 3 (much more of the time now)."

            "text": "The SURPASS J-mono and SURPASS J-combo trials established the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in Japanese patients with T2D [20, 21]. In the current exploratory analysis of the SURPASS J-mono trial, we build upon these findings by reporting multiple domains of treatment satisfaction, further supporting the value of tirzepatide treatment in this patient population.\nOverall, the DTSQc treatment satisfaction scores after 52 weeks were significantly greater among patients who received treatment with tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) than with dulaglutide 0.75 mg. The DTSQc perceived frequency score of unacceptable hyperglycemia was significantly lower across all tirzepatide treatment arms compared with that of dulaglutide, while the perceived frequency score of unacceptable hypoglycemia was similar across tirzepatide and dulaglutide arms. Furthermore, treatment satisfaction was generally higher with tirzepatide treatment, or\ncomparable with that of dulaglutide, in subgroup analyses by patient age (\\65 or C 65 years), sex, baseline BMI (\\ 25 or C 25 kg/ m2), and baseline HbA1c (B 8.5% or[8.5%).\nPatient satisfaction is an important outcome in drug treatment, with greater treatment satisfaction associated with better treatment compliance and improved persistence [22]. In a recent report of patients with T2D in Japan, increased treatment satisfaction (as measured by the DTSQ) was highly correlated with an increase in treatment motivation [23].\nTirzepatide PROs have been described in the global SURPASS clinical trial program. In a subset of patients from the SURPASS-2 and SURPASS-3 trials, tirzepatide treatment was reported as being meaningful, with significant positive impacts on quality of life [24]. In the SURPASS-3 trial, the DTSQc total score was significantly higher for all tirzepatide doses compared with that for insulin degludec, indicating a greater improvement in treatment satisfaction [25]. In addition, the self-reported DTSQc score\nFig. 2 Mean DTSQc scores at week 52 for the modified intent-to-treat population (efficacy analysis set). Data are shown as LSM (SE). The overall treatment satisfaction score represents the sum of the scores on item 1 and items 4 through 8 of the DTSQc, with possible total scores ranging from - 18 to ? 18 (higher scores represent greater satisfaction). Possible scores for perceived frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia range from - 3\n(much less of the time now) to ? 3 (much more of the time now). Treatment comparisons at week 52 were made between tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg and dulaglutide 0.75 mg using a mixed model for repeated measures. ***P\\ 0.001 vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg. DTSQc Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (change), LSM least-squares mean, SE standard error\nfor perceived frequency of unacceptable hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia was significantly lower with tirzepatide 15 mg and 5 mg, respectively, compared with insulin degludec [25]. In pooled analyses of the SURPASS 1\u20135 trials, greater improvements in PROs were observed among patients who achieved larger reductions in HbA1c and body weight [26, 27]. Specifically, a greater improvement from baseline in DTSQc scores was observed among patients with a C 2% decrease in HbA1c levels and C 20% weight loss [26, 27].\nIn the dulaglutide treatment arm, 50\u201363% of patients reported a rating of 2 or 3 (much more satisfied) on the DTSQc treatment satisfaction items, even though no significant weight reductions were observed in this cohort [21]. This is consistent with our previous report that showed 67.0% of patients who received\ndulaglutide achieved an HbA1c\\7.0% [21]. For the tirzepatide treatment arms, where significant weight reductions were observed after 52 weeks of treatment [21], more than 80% of patients reported a rating of 2 or 3 on the DTSQc treatment satisfaction items. It is difficult to ascertain any significant differences between the DTSQc scores among the three tirzepatide dose groups, and it also remains unclear whether further reductions in HbA1c and body weight may contribute to further improvements in DTSQc responses.\nResults from the subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in DTSQc scores between the tirzepatide and dulaglutide arms among patients aged C 65 years and those with a BMI\\25 kg/m2. However, treatment satisfaction was higher among patients aged\\65 years and those with a BMI C 25 kg/\nFig. 3 Mean DTSQc treatment satisfaction scores for subgroups at week 52. Mean DTSQc scores at week 52 for the modified intent to treat population (efficacy analysis set) are shown for the subgroup analyses, including a age (\\ 65 and C 65 years), b sex, c baseline BMI (\\ 25 and C 25 kg/m2), and d baseline HbA1c (B 8.5% and [ 8.5%). Data are shown as LSM (SE). The overall treatment satisfaction score represents the sum of the scores on item 1 and items 4 through 8 of the DTSQc,\nwith possible total scores ranging from - 18 to ? 18 (higher scores represent greater satisfaction).

Satisfaction with weight loss also appears to be higher in these populations of younger patients and those with a higher BMI. Of note, Japanese patients with T2D, in general, are leaner than Western patients; hence, weight reduction is not a specific consideration in this population with a relatively leaner body mass.\nThis analysis has some limitations. First, there were a small number of patients in some subgroups of the analyses of treatment satisfaction by background characteristics. Second, in the SURPASS J-mono trial, dulaglutide was administered at a dose of 0.75 mg in accordance with the Japan label. Hence, the comparisons reported between tirzepatide and dulaglutide in this analysis may not extrapolate to higher doses of dulaglutide. Thirdly, as this analysis was performed in patients who completed study treatment, it is difficult to evaluate if adverse events had an impact on treatment satisfaction. In addition, there are general limitations of the DTSQ, including the subjective nature of some factors. Of note, treatment satisfaction may be higher in clinical trial settings compared with real-world data because of potentially higher treatment adherence among patients enrolled in clinical trials."

Increased treatment satisfaction was also observed among patients who received dulaglutide 0.75 mg, despite no significant weight loss observed in this treatment arm, suggesting that treatment satisfaction was influenced primarily by improved glycemic control among Japanese patients with T2D. A high level of treatment satisfaction may translate into clinically meaningful improvements with reduced long-term diabetes-related complications."
