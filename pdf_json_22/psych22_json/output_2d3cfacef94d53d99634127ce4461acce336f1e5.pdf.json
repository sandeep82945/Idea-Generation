    "abstractText": "Adolescence is characterized by emotional instability and risk-taking behaviours that can lead to, among other things, an increased risk of developing pathological video-gaming and gambling habits. The aim of this Study is to assess the prevalence and type of video gaming and gambling habits in adolescent students attending Italian upper-secondary schools. The cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey using validated questionnaires. The primary outcome measures were the prevalence of past-year video gaming and gambling activities. The sample consisted of 502 adolescent students from firstand second-grade secondary schools. A total of 40.8% of participants were video gamers, 4.8% were gamblers, 17.8% were both video gamers and gamblers, and the remaining 36.6% were not players. Among participants who reported video gaming activity (n = 294), 68.0% were classified as nonproblem gamers, 24.5% as at-risk gamers, and 7.5% as disordered video gamers. Among the participants who reported gambling activity (n = 113), 85.8% were not problematic gamblers, 8.9% were at-risk gamblers, and 5.3% were pathological gamblers. Only 0.2% of all subjects met the criteria for both pathological gambling and pathological video game use. The findings indicate that video gaming and gambling are common leisure times among adolescent students. However, a small but significant minority of these adolescents met the criteria for either severe problem gaming or gambling or both.",

The eleventh edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), which was produced by the World Health Organization, defines gaming disorder as a pattern of recurrent or persistent gaming behaviour manifested by impaired control over gaming, exaggerated priority given to gaming (which takes precedence over daily activities as well as other life interests), and perpetuation or even intensification of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. Furthermore, it defines gambling disorder using the same criteria but referring to gambling instead of gaming behaviours.\n*Correspondence: loredana.cena@unibs.it\n1 Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Section of Neuroscience, Observatory of Perinatal Clinical Psychology, University of Brescia, viale Europa, 11 - 25123 Brescia, Italy Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nGrowing empirical evidence suggests that each of these two disorders is positively associated with adolescents\u2019 mental health issues [1, 2], substance use [3, 4], and physical violence [3, 5]. With regard to epidemiologic data, at present, it is estimated that 0.2%-12.3% of adolescents in Europe meet the criteria for internet gaming disorder [6], whereas 0.2%-5.0% meet the criteria for problem gambling [7], with large heterogeneity across nations.\nTherefore, it is not surprising that pathological use of video gaming and pathological gambling have become an emerging public health problem [8, 9]. However, to define efficient prevention and intervention plans and to properly allocate resources, a precise estimation of these mental disorders among adolescents remains an urgent requirement. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and type of video gaming and gambling habits in adolescent students attending Italian upper-secondary schools."

However, a small but significant minority (5.0%) of these adolescents met the criteria for either severe problem gaming, severe problem gambling or both. The evidence presented here is consistent with international literature [7, 8] and will hopefully encourage more research into youth video gaming and gambling to better elucidate the determinants of these phenomena.\nThe major limitations of this study are the cross-sectional design, the use of self-report tools, and a limited sample size that did not allow the use of logistic regression analysis to determine the specific odds for various vulnerability and protective factors.\nFuture studies should expand the sample size and include adolescents who do not attend school and represent different parts of the country. Assessing the prevalence of problematic video gaming use and gambling in adolescents would help to increase awareness about these emergent public health issues and take specific measures for preventing, identifying, managing, and treating these disorders."
