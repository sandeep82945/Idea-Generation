    "abstractText": "In the present study, gels based on xanthan gum and poloxamer 407 have been developed and characterized in order to convey natural antioxidant molecules included in niosomes. Specifically, the studies were conducted to evaluate how the vesicular systems affect the release of the active ingredient and which formulation is most suitable for cutaneous application. Niosomes, composed of Span 20 or Tween 20, were produced through the direct hydration method, and therefore, borate buffer or a micellar solution of poloxamer 188 was used as the aqueous phase. The niosomes were firstly characterized in terms of morphology, dimensional and encapsulation stability. Afterwards, gels based on poloxamer 407 or xanthan gum were compared in terms of spreadability and adhesiveness. It was found to have greater spreadability for gels based on poloxamer 407 and 100% adhesiveness for those based on xanthan gum. The in vitro diffusion of drugs studied using Franz cells associated with membranes of mixed cellulose esters showed that the use of a poloxamer micellar hydration phase determined a lower release as well as the use of Span 20. The thickened niosomes ensured controlled diffusion of the antioxidant molecules. Lastly, the in vivo irritation test confirmed the safeness of niosomal gels after cutaneous application.",

            "text": "Antioxidants molecules (AMs) represent our body\u2019s defense system against damage caused by free radicals: they are chemically defined as reducing agents capable of slowing down or preventing the oxidation chain reactions triggered by free radicals in the presence of oxidative stress. Much of the inputs to the production of radicals occurs as a consequence of the body\u2019s metabolism and respiration, but also psycho-physical stress, environmental factors such as smog and smoke, and UV rays can increase the production of reactive elements inducing a cellular overload (oxidative stress) with altered functionality and consequent cutaneous disorders, e.g., dermatitis, tumors, psoriasis, wrinkles, alopecia, acne and skin aging. For instance, some research has shown that a high concentration of the hydroxyl radical OH\u00b7 is the cause of the onset of tumors, following an alteration of the genetic information due to the oxidation of the nitrogenous bases [1]. Instead, the attack of the radicals on the lipid substrates, the main components of the cell membranes, gives rise to allyl bond peroxidation reactions, resulting in cell wall degradation.\nGels 2023, 9, 107. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9020107 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 107 2 of 16\nTherefore, antioxidants are the best allies in keeping the body healthy and for protecting the skin from the harmful effects of external factors. The mechanism of action of AMs in radical inhibition can be summarized in the following three points: (a) neutralization of reactive species, (b) sequestration of transition metal ions (chelating effect) and (c) enzymes inhibition involved in reactive oxygen species production [2]. From a physiological point of view, the biological system uses endogenous AMs such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase to protect the body. When the endogenous defense systems may not be sufficient, the intake of exogenous AMs by diet (i.e., vitamin C and E), or even by topical or oral administration, becomes necessary. However, it should be kept in mind that many of these substances are particularly insoluble and unstable at different pH and temperature levels and under environmental stress conditions; therefore, the most effective solution is the topical application through delivery systems such as phospholipid-based (liposomes) and niotenside-based (niosomes) vesicular systems [3] to ensure protection from degradation, thus opening up a vast field in the research and production of suitable cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations. In the present study, gallic (GA) and ferulic acid (FA) were considered as example AMs of natural origin due to their activity. Indeed, GA is a potent tyrosinase inhibitor with excellent antioxidant effects, together with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity [4\u20136]. Moreover, this natural triphenolic compound is an effective ingredient for the treatment of allergic contact dermatitis [7]. However, due to its poor water solubility, it has rarely been used for dermatologic applications. As for FA, its wide use in skin care products is corroborated by numerous studies demonstrating its protective role in skin structure. Furthermore, FA exhibits low toxicity and optimal absorption through the skin and tends to remain in the bloodstream longer than other phenolic compounds [8]. FA also performs powerful anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic\u2014protective of the vascular endothelium\u2014antiplatelet and antiapoptotic actions [9]. Finally, in order to obtain suitable systems for cutaneous application and delivery of AM embedded in niosomes, this research investigated the development and characterization of gels based on poloxamer 407 and xanthan gum."

During the visualization, the temperature of the sample was maintained below \u2212175 \u25e6C. Small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) experiments were performed using the Offline Xeuss 3.0 Diamond-Leeds SAXS facility (DL-SAXS) at Diamond Light Source (Harwell, UK).

The absorbance at 517 nm was obtained by means of a UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer (Jenway 7305 Spectrophotometer, VWR International Srl, Milan, Italy), as previously described [16]. The IC50 values were calculated from the results after applying a previously obtained calibration curve. The obtained values (\u00b5g/mL) were the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. The quantitative FRAP assay measures the plasma ferric ion reducing capacity as it is based on the reduction of ferric ions (Fe3+) to ferrous ions (Fe2+) under acidic conditions in the presence of 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ) [17]. Indeed, the presence of an AM facilitates the reduction of the Fe3+\u2013TPTZ complex to the ferrous form, leading to an intense blue coloration measured at 593 nm (absorption maximum wavelength). Trolox was employed to perform the calibration curves, and therefore, the FRAP antioxidant activity is given as \u00b5mol Trolox equivalent/g of compounds."

For instance, when B is used, the coexistence of unilamellar, multilamellar and multivesicular systems is evidenced (Figure 1a,c). A similar morphological aspect was obtained for NSP (Figure 1b), while in the case of NTP, multilamellar vesicles were obtained (Figure 1d). This behavior could be ascribed to the interaction between the triblock copolymer p188 (P) and T, and it could be related to the ability of poloxamer micelles to stabilize the vesicular system by creating a \u201cmatryoshka\u201d system, as reported in the literature [26]. In order to elucidate the internal structures of the different niosomal formulations, SAXS analysis was performed. The results, reported in Figure 2, show similar scattering curves for all the samples, confirming that both S and T determine the formation of similar vesicles. In particular, at\nFigure 1.

However, the vesicles show a different degree of lamellarity and a rather disordered nature. Indeed, the\nGels 2023, 9, 107 7 of 16\nBragg peak observed at about 0.14 \u00c5\u22121 in the scattering profiles confirms the lamellar inner structure of the niosomes, but its width and the absence of the characteristic higher-order peaks suggest that the positional correlation between adjacent bilayers is very small and/or that the degree of lamellarity is very low [27]. Interestingly, both the position and width of the peak appear related to the niosomes composition. As shown in Table 2, the unit cell parameter (which corresponds to the thickness of the vesicles layer plus the thickness of the aqueous layer separating two vesicles layers and which can be calculated from the position of the Bragg peak) depends on the used surfactant, while the degree of lamellarity, which can be indicatively derived by applying the Scherrer equation to the Bragg peak broadening under the assumption that other effects (such as stacking disorder or undulation effects) can be ignored [28], seems controlled by a combination of the type of surfactant and the hydration medium.\nGels 2022, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 17\nTable 3.

SAXS/WAXS profiles of NSP (black), NSB (blue), NTP (red) and NTB (green).\nGels 2023, 9, 107 8 of 16\nTable 2 shows that T probably induces a larger hydration of the vesicular layers (both in the presence of B and of P), so that the total thickness increases by about 10%. On the other side, the presence of P induces an ordering of the lamellar structure, which results in the enhancement of the mean crystallite size, particularly evident in the case of niosomes prepared with S as surfactant. After production, the AMs-loaded formulations were characterized in terms of size and polydispersity. Afterwards, the dimensional stability was investigated for 30 days, as reported in Table 3.\nThe size distribution of niosomes after production ranged between 420 and 860 nm; thus, this parameter was strongly influenced by the composition of the vesicles. In particular, the higher dimensional increase was evidenced for niosomes comprising the combination of T and P as a surfactant and hydrating phase. This data agrees with the morphological and SAXS analyses, as well as with the literature [26], supporting the hypothesis that the interaction between the micelles and the bilayers could facilitate the formation of larger vesicles [26]. Indeed, as mentioned above, the resulting dimensions are influenced not only by the nature of T, responsible for the greater hydration of the layers, but also by the increase in lamellarity induced by P. Moreover, no significant differences related to the alternative encapsulation of each AM have been evidenced. Concerning dispersity indexes, the presence of heterogeneous populations has been denoted, in particular, one month after production, since PdI values higher than 0.2 indicate a wide size distribution [29]."

            "text": "Being niosomes dispersed in liquid form, the administration onto the skin is difficult and onsite permanence limited. Therefore, to obtain formulations with a certain grade of viscosity suitable for topical application, two different gelling agents, namely, xanthan gum and poloxamer 407 have been selected and added to niosome formulations. Indeed, these two biocompatible polymers are able to confer different adhesive properties to niosomes. Xanthan gum, an anionic polysaccharide obtained by bacterial fermentation [35], is a good thickening agent, while on the other hand, poloxamer 407 possesses peculiar thermoreversible properties passing from a sol state at a low temperature to gel consistency at body temperature [31]. Spreadability and leakage were investigated in vitro to verify the suitability of the thickened formulations for topical administration. Indeed, these parameters are involved in many properties of the final formulation, such as gel extrusion from the package, skin coverage, patient compliance and drug therapeutic efficacy [18]. It has been demonstrated that presence of encapsulated drugs does not affect the technological performance of the thickened systems [18]; therefore, experiments were performed on empty formulations. The obtained results are reported in Table 4.\nn.d.: not detectable.\nAs evidenced, the addition of xanthan gum led to the formation of a stiff gel formulation. In fact, concerning spreadability, the lowest values have been obtained on xg-niosomes, and no running across the agar plate has been observed in leakage tests. This aspect could ensure higher retention on the application site. Conversely, pol-niosomes showed higher values in terms of spreadability and leakage behavior. In general, considering the hydration medium, niosomes composed of P resulted in thicker formulations, independently of the gelling agent used. This result could be related to the above-described role of the P micellar system in creating a rigid and complex structure.\nGels 2023, 9, 107 12 of 16\nConcerning the pH characteristics of niosomal gels, as summarized in Table 5, it emerges that the use of pol as a hydration medium gives rise to the formation of a pH around 5, but this is compatible anyway with skin characteristics. Taking into consideration the pKa values of both GA (4.41) and FA (4.58) we can hypothesize that the ratio at pH 5 between GA and gallate or FA and ferulate may be shifted towards the undissociated form. Indeed, from a micro and macroscopical point of view, no aggregation, precipitation, separation or changes in the aspect of the gelled formulation are evident.

Data re rese t t e ea f f r i e e e t ex eri e ts s. .\nAs depicted, the obtained diffusion profiles showed different behavior for GA and FA. In the case of GA, the passage of the drug through the membrane is mainly influenced by the thickening agent. In fact, the addition of xg provides a higher control on drug diffusion with respect to pol.\nGels 2023, 9, 107 13 of 16\nConcerning FA, the different behavior seems to be related to the nature of the surfactant employed for the formulation. In the case of NSB and NSP, xg induced a lowest FA passage, while for NTB and NTP no significant differences have been detected with the use of xg or pol. Furthermore, the diffusion kinetics of AMs were expressed as fluxes (Table 6), extrapolated from the slopes of diffusion profiles (Js) and normalized in function of the experimental AM concentration in each formulation (Jn).\nConcerning GA, the pol-made gel led to a faster diffusion of the drug. In fact, the possible solubilization of GA in pol, thanks to the ability of the polymer in creating a micellar network, could be responsible for its increased passage through the membrane. Considering the Jn values of FA diffusion, it was found that when T is used in the composition, the addition of a thickening agent did not affect a controlled passage of the drug with respect to formulations and data are superimposable. This behavior could be ascribed to the interaction between T and FA, and thus, it can be proposed that the diffusion is mainly governed by the vesicular system and less by the hydrophilic nature of the polymers, resulting in less structured gels. In all cases, P as a hydration medium of niosomes plays a crucial role in GA diffusion, corroborating the influence of the \u201cmatryoshka\u201d configuration on drug diffusion."

            "text": "Being the topical administration the final target of these formulations, a patch test was performed in order to evaluate the safeness of the produced niosomal gels. Taking into account the results of spreadability and leakage, xg-niosomes have been selected for the patch test. To be precise, the potential irritation caused by applying xg-NSB, xg-NSP, xg-NTB and xg-NTP on skin have been evaluated on 20 healthy volunteers and the results expressed as a percentage of irritative reactions (Figure 7).\nGels 2023, 9, 107 14 of 16\nGels 2022, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 17\nFigure 7. In vivo irritative reactions of xg-NSB (blue), xg-NSP (orange), xg-NTB (green) and xg-NTP (yellow) on 20 healthy volunteers, acquired by patch test.\nIt was found that the formulations exhibited the same results in terms of safeness; thus, all niosomal gels applied for 48 h under occlusive conditions can be classified as nonirritant. In fact, in 95% of cases, no irritative reactions have been detected, while 5% of cases led to negligible reactions, confirming the suitability of these systems for topical application.\n4. Conclusions The present investigation enabled the design of niosomal gels suitable for AMs loading and subsequent topical delivery. Specifically, this study highlighted the influence of a hydration medium (B or P) and a thickening agent (xg or pol) on the diffusion of AMs. Strikingly, the results of the Franz-cell experiments and patch tests demonstrated that niosomal gel can deliver AMs in different ways depending on the interaction between the loaded drug, the non-ionic surfactant and the thickener agent. Indeed, in the case of FA, the presence of T facilitated an in vitro diffusion mainly governed by the vesicular system, while in the case of GA, an important role is due to the hydrophilic nature of the thickeners, corroborating the influence of the \u201cmatryoshka\u201d configuration on drug diffusion. These data are in agreement with the cryo-TEM and SAXS analyses, showing the coexistence of unilamellar, multilamellar and multivesicular systems after hydration with B, or sole multilamellar vesicles, in the case of P hydration. However, an important contribution of the surfactant constituting the niosomes has been detected by means of SAXS analysis. Indeed, T seems to give rise to great hydration of the vesicle\u2019s layers both in the presence of B and of P, while in the case of niosomes prepared with S as the surfactant, the presence of P induces an ordering of the lamellar structure resulting in the enhancement of the mean crystallite size. Moreover, no irritative reactions were detected during patch tests in 95% of cases, confirming the suitability of these systems for topical application.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Figure S1: Graphical diagram of the production steps of niosomes and niosomal gels.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.C. and M.S.; methodology, R.C., M.S., A.B., L.M., P.M. and M.D.; investigation, M.S., A.B., L.M., R.B., A.P. and P.M.; data curation, M.S. and R.C.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, M.S. and R.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, R.C., M.S. and A.B.;\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n100\nAbsent Light Erhytema Visible Erhytema Moderate Erhytema Oedema Absent Light Erhytema Visible Erhytema Moderate Erhytema Oedema\n15 minutes post exposure 24 hours post exposure\nIr ri\nta tiv\ne re\nac tio\nns (%\n)\nFigure 7.
