 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Test the electrochemical sensor array on a wider variety of olive oil samples, including more countries/regions of origin, harvest years, olive cultivars, etc. to further evaluate discrimination ability.

2. Optimize the sensor materials and electrochemical techniques to improve sensitivity and selectivity for phenolic compounds in olive oils. Explore different nanomaterials, modifiers, electrode configurations, voltammetric techniques, etc. 

3. Develop a portable prototype electrochemical olive oil analysis device based on the sensor array for rapid in-field testing and authentication. Evaluate real-world performance.

4. Extend the sensor array approach to analyze and discriminate other food oils beyond olive, pomace, and sunflower oils. Determine if geographical origin and quality factors can be identified.

5. Correlate the electrochemical profiles from the sensor array with detailed chemical composition data from advanced techniques like LC-MS. Identify the specific phenolic biomarkers associated with discrimination and antioxidant activity.
