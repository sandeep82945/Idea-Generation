            "text": "Asthma is one of the world\u00b4s largest non-communicable diseases [1], affecting 339 million people [2]. It is considered a major social and health concern, being associated with a high economic burden, related to days out of work and school, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and mortality [3, 4].\nAsthma is characterized by a reversible airway obstruction presented with any combi-\nnation of the following manifestations and symptoms: wheezing, dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperresponsiveness [5]. Due to these symptoms, patients with asthma, in comparison to their peers, are characterized by lower levels of physical activity [6\u201310]. They also commonly exercise at lower intensities, mostly because they believe that their disease is a barrier to exercise [9, 11, 12]. In its turn, inactivity can lead to worsening in asthma symptoms and control, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [13], and a decline in lung function, particularly in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), in FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) [11, 14, 15].\nAccording to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) [16], adults with asthma should\nengage in physical activity and exercise programs for their overall health benefit. Nevertheless, recommendations on how to perform physical activity or exercise as a part of their treatment is missing in this guideline. There is some evidence showing a positive effect of exercise programs, such as walking, jogging or cycling, reducing exacerbations and rescue medication use [17], and improving asthma-related symptoms, asthma control, lung function [18], exercise tolerance, and HRQoL [19].\nNordic walking (NW) is one of the exercise programs that could have potential benefits for people with asthma. The main difference between NW and conventional walking is the use of two poles to boost the walk, involving for instance the upper limb during the march. It was born in Finland during the 1930s as a cross-country skiers training, and it was been developed, transitioning from skiers to university and educative fields, and then to literature and scientific publications [20, 21]. The evidence is still scarce, but it has shown benefits in exercise tolerance and HRQoL in other chronic conditions, such as metabolic syndrome, musculoskeletal disorders, Parkinson disease [22\u201324], cardiovascular diseases [25] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [26]. In COPD, NW improved exercise tolerance (measured as meters walked in six-minute walking test-6MWT); daily physical activity levels; dyspnea; anxiety and HRQoL. COPD and asthma are both respiratory diseases that share common symptoms and signs, such as cough, dyspnea and limited air flow, as well as limited exercise tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesize that similar benefits with NW can also be achieved in patients with asthma.\nThus, the primary aim of this clinical trial is to determine whether the effect of a NW train-\ning program plus education and usual care is superior to education and usual care only, in terms of exercise tolerance and other health-related outcomes, in patients with asthma. Secondary, we aim to explore the patients\u2019 experience with the NW program.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281007 March 9, 2023 2 / 13\npoles.

Participants will only know the result of the randomization after the education. Educational sessions will be conducted with groups of approximately 6\u201310 patients. Sessions will be facilitated by a physiotherapist, and will take place in the Faculty of Physiotherapy of The University of A Coru\u00f1a. Different concepts and guidance related to asthma self-management will be addressed, based on an informative brochure built by the research team. This brochure will be provided to the participants at the end of the education component. If patients miss one session, they will be phone called to wonder about reasons, to be encouraged to assist next sessions and an individual education session will be scheduled to address the missed topic. Besides, patients should keep their usual care, namely attend their regular medical appointments, take the medication under prescription and follow physician recommendations as usual.\nParticipants in the NW group will additionally enrol in an eight-week NW program [35] of\nthree sessions per week (total of 24 sessions). Feasibility of the NW program has previously been tested in four patients, who showed a good acceptance and satisfaction with intervention received [34]. Each session will last one hour and include: a warm-up period of 15 minutes with articular mobility, body-weight exercises with walking poles, and five minutes of walking without poles; 30 minutes of NW, with an intensity of 70\u201385% theoretical maximum heart rate (HRmax = 206.9 \u2013(0.7 x age)) [36]; cold-down period of five minutes of relaxed walk without poles, stretching and breathing exercises. NW program will be provided by the same physiotherapist in charge of the educational component, who was trained in NW in Finland. When participants fail one exercise session, he/she will be called to wonder about reasons and to be encouraged to participate in the next session. After finishing the eight-week period, participants will be encouraged to continue by themselves the NW sessions and a pair of poles will be provided to achieve this objective."

The primary outcome will be exercise tolerance, measured by the dis-\ntance walked during the 6MWT, a reliable and validated test in patients with asthma [37], which is strongly related with important clinical outcomes as dyspnea and fatigue perceived [32].\nSecondary outcomes. Exercise tolerance will also be assessed through the number of repe-\ntitions during the one-minute sit-to-stand test (1MSTST). This test is focused in lower limb function, especially quadriceps force [38].\nThe secondary outcome measurements will include physical activity level (accelerometry,\nInternational Physical Activity Questionnaire -IPAQ, and patient\u2019s diary), asthma-related symptoms and asthma control (Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test -CARAT and patient\u2019s diary), dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council -mMRC, and Borg scale), lung function (spirometry), handgrip strength (hand dynamometry), HRQoL (European Quality of Life Questionnaire\u2013 5 dimensions\u2013 5 levels -EQ-5D-5L, mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire -miniAQLQ), quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index -PQSI), treatment adherence (Test of Adhesion to Inhalers -TAI, and patient\u2019s diary), and healthcare resources use (patient\u2019s diary).\nOther measures. Respiratory muscle strength (maximum inspiratory -MIP and expira-\ntory pressure -MEP) will be assessed to characterize sample, since no change with NW\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281007 March 9, 2023 4 / 13\nprogram is expected. Correlation with other outcomes such as exercise tolerance and physical activity will be explored [39].\nAdverse effects reported by the participants will be registered.

            "text": "All the assessments will take place at the Faculty of Physiotherapy in The University of A Coru\u00f1a. Assessments will be performed by the same trained physiotherapist (different from the one in charge of interventions), blinded to the group allocation. The evaluator has been trained to perform these assessments, in which she also has previous experience. To avoid the risk that participants reveal to which group they belong during the first evaluation, the allocation will be only made after all baseline measurements and the education component. The evaluator will be also blinded during the following assessment visits. In the case this blinding is compromised due to the possible comments of the participants, this will be reported. When a participant fails an evaluation appointment, the evaluator will contact him/her in order to propose a date to a new appointment.\nAfter reading the information sheet and signing the informed consent, an anamnesis will\nbe performed in order to collect the sociodemographic variables (age, sex, occupation. . .), past history (e.g., surgical, comorbidities, etc.) and to confirm the fulfilment of the eligibility criteria.\nAll questionnaires, excepting IPAQ, will be self-completed by the participants after a brief\nexplanation of the evaluator. The evaluator will be available to clarify any doubts during the questionnaires filling and at the end will check if all questions were covered.\nAll outcomes will be measured at baseline, postintervention, and at three and six months\nfollow-up, except respiratory muscle strength (measured only at baseline) and treatment adherence and healthcare resources use (not analysed at baseline). Adverse effects related to following described outcomes, or during intervention, will be registered if pertinent.\nExercise tolerance will be measured with 6MWT and 1MSTS. To perform the 6MWT, an indoor corridor 30 metres long will be used, following ATS/ERS guidelines [32]. Before and after the test, vital signs (heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure), fatigue of the lower limbs and dyspnea (using the modified Borg scale 1\u201310) will be recorded [40]. Two tests will be performed, with a minimum rest of 30 minutes, and the longest distance of the two tests will be selected for the analysis. For the 1MSTST, an armless chair will be used to ensure the upper limbs are not taking part in action. Subjects will be instructed to perform as many sit-tostand movements that they can do in one minute [41, 42].\nAccelerometry and the IPAQ, short form will be used to assess physical activity. The accel-\nerometer MoveMonitor DynaPort1MM+ (McRoberts, The Hague, the Netherlands) will be used to register physical activity during seven days. Time lying down, sitting, standing up and walking, number of steps per day, intensity of movement, kilocalories consumed and metabolic equivalent of task (MET), will be analysed. Validity of accelerometer has been documented in COPD [43] and this tool has been used in previous studies in patients with asthma [44]. Besides, we will use IPAQ-short form, administrated through personal interview. The questionnaire has been validated in the Spanish population [45] and results will be analysed following the indications of the IPAQ group [46]. Also, number of steps per day should be recorded by patients in their patient\u2019s diary, registered by a Google Fit1 Smartphone App\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281007 March 9, 2023 5 / 13\n(Google LLC, Mountain View, CA, USA); and register of their physical activity or exercise performed on the non-session\u2019s day and once the sessions period has finished.\nAsthma-related symptoms and asthma control will be measured using the CARAT, vali-\ndated in patients with asthma [47], which has been used in Spanish population [48]. Additional analysis will be made from data extracted from the patient\u00b4s diary, in terms of dyspnea measured with modified Borg scale, expectoration, cough, perception of wheezing, work absence due to asthma symptoms or avoidance of doing some activity due to same reason. Related to dyspnea, it will be assessed also during personal interview using the mMRC scale [49]. In addition, modified Borg scale will be used before and after each NW session [40].\nLung function will be assessed with a spirometry following international recommendations\nof ATS/ERS [50]. FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, forced expiratory flow at 25 and 75% of the pulmonary volume (FEF25-75%) and PEF will be recorded, obtained with a spirometer (Datospir1 120C, Sibelmed, Barcelona, Spain). Moreover, PEF will be assessed every day by patients in their diary. A peak-flow meter will be provided to each patient by the study.\nHandgrip strength will be measured in both hands, registering data in kilograms, and using\nJamar1 hand-dynamometer (Performance Health, Warrenville, IL, USA) and following Mathiowetz et al. protocol [51].\nHRQoL will be assessed using a generic and asthma-specific questionnaires. EQ-5D-5L has\nbeen validated in patients with asthma [52] and in Spanish population [53]. MiniAQLQ has been validated to use in this population [54], and has already been used in Spanish context [55, 56].\nQuality of sleep will be assessed using PQSI, validated in Spanish [57]. Related to treatment adherence, inhaler adherence will be evaluated using the TAI, validated in patients with asthma and in the Spanish population [58]. Also, participants should note in their diary when, what and in which dosage need take medicine in order to relieve symptoms.\nHealthcare resources use will be analysed as well taking in count data from patient\u2019s diary\n(emergency service or unscheduled medical visits due to asthmatic symptoms).\nRespiratory muscle strength will be measured by MIP and MEP, following Spanish Society\nof Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) recommendations [59]. A digital manometer MicroRPM1 (Vyaire Medical GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany), a flanged mouthpiece and the PUMA1 software (Vyaire Medical GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany) will be used. At least six acceptable measurements are required and three of them should be reproductible, with less than 5% of difference between them.\nQualitative data will be obtained through focus group meetings, moderated by an experi-\nenced researcher. Another researcher will take part in the meeting to observe and take notes. These two researchers, will start introducing themselves and then moderator will give a clear explanation of the aim of the meeting before starting. Then, following a semi-structured guide with open-ended questions (S2 Appendix), focus groups will be conducted in order to gather a better understanding of participants experience. Around 15 participants will participate in focus groups [60], after receiving the NW program. Every NW group will constitute a focus group. Focus groups will be conducted in a room of the Faculty of Physiotherapy, in the University of A Coru\u00f1a, and are expected to last about 90 minutes. Focus groups will be recorded (video and audio) and transcribed under consent of participants.\nParticipants dropping out of the study, if any, will be contacted to record possible reasons,\nand in case they are from the NW group they will also asked regarding the possibility to participate in the focus group and to provide data registered in their diary.\nParticipant timeline. Participants will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-intervention\n(T1), and then at three (T2) and six months (T3) follow-up, as shown in Fig 1. After intervention, only NW group will be interviewed through focus groups.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281007 March 9, 2023 6 / 13"

The study has been prospectively registered, and to our knowledge, it is the first study exploring this topic. Nordic walking is still a recent and novel exercise training modality, with few studies published in the health field. Based on previous studies about exercise programs [17\u201319], we hypothesise that the NW program in patients with asthma will increase exercise tolerance, physical activity level, asthma-related symptoms, asthma control, and HRQoL. Due to the characteristics of the intervention (involvement of the upper limbs), handgrip strength could also get improved [64]. We are expecting that lung function remains unchanged [65, 66], but as there is some controversy in current literature, we have decided to collect this data at all time-points [18, 19]. If the beneficial effects of NW are demonstrated, a new community-based therapeutic approach can be added to the current recommended and implemented in clinical practice. Nordic walking is affordable and feasible in the community, taking advantage of blue and green spaces in every patient\u00b4s environment\u2013following Urban Training1 concept\u2013that have already shown benefits in terms of physical activity in patients with COPD [67]. Indirectly, the demonstration of our hypothesis could lead to added benefits, if the use of rescue medication, or medical visits (emergency department or unscheduled visits) are reduced: deriving from\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281007 March 9, 2023 8 / 13\nthat reduction in healthcare resources use, a mitigation in socio-sanitary costs could be achieved."

Also, this pilot study allowed us to estimate the sample size needed [34]. Participants will be recruited during two years, and in consequence, NW program will be conducted across the seasons, bringing different challenges, such as exposure to environment allergens for patients with allergic asthma. This augmented exposure happens specially from January to June, in which pollen concentration are higher, and maybe during this period an attempt to schedule sessions in hours with lower pollen concentrations (hours with warm temperatures [68]) could be sought [69].\nDue to the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor physiotherapist in charge are\nblinded to allocation. The possible bias can be minimized by the presence of a blinded evaluator. Nevertheless, after the intervention the evaluator\u00b4s blinding could be compromised due to possible comments of participants. If this happens, this will be reported.\nFinally, some of the outcomes included in this study have already been analysed in patients\nwith asthma after an exercise training programme and were shown to be sensitive to change [17\u201319, 26]. In addition, we will use both quantitative and qualitative methods, which can give a wider understanding of the feasibility of NW for patients, permitting analysing also the experience of participants with the exercise program.
