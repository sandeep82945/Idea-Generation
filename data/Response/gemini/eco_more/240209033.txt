1. **Investigate the performance of ML-based forecast reconciliation methods on other datasets with different cross-temporal hierarchies.** This would help to generalize the findings of the paper and to identify the factors that affect the performance of these methods.
2. **Develop new ML-based forecast reconciliation methods that are specifically designed for cross-temporal hierarchies.** This could lead to further improvements in forecast accuracy.
3. **Explore the use of other machine learning algorithms for forecast reconciliation.** The paper only considers random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, but there are many other algorithms that could be used.
4. **Investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the performance of ML-based forecast reconciliation methods.** The paper only considers default hyperparameter settings, but it is possible that tuning the hyperparameters could lead to further improvements in forecast accuracy.
5. **Develop new methods for evaluating the performance of forecast reconciliation methods.** The paper uses the weighted absolute percentage error (WAPE) as the forecast error metric, but there are other metrics that could be used.
