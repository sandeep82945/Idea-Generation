    "abstractText": "The Protocadherin-10 (PCDH10) gene is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depression (MD). The PCDH10 protein is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that belongs to the d2-protocadherin family. PCDH10 is highly expressed in the developing brain, especially in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, the role of PCDH10 in vivo has been debatable: one paper reported that a Pcdh10 mutant mouse line showed changes in axonal projections; however, another Pcdh10 mutant mouse line was reported to have failed to detect axonal phenotypes. Therefore, the actual roles of PCDH10 in the brain remain to be elucidated. We established a new Pcdh10 KO mouse line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, without inserting gene cassettes to avoid nonspecific effects, examined the roles of PCDH10 in the brain, and studied the behavioral consequences of Pcdh10 inactivation. Here, we show that Pcdh10 KO mice do not show defects in axonal development. Instead, we find that Pcdh10 KO mice exhibit impaired development of excitatory synapses in the dorsal BLA. We further demonstrate that male Pcdh10 KO mice exhibit reduced anxiety-related behaviors, impaired fear conditioning, decreased stress-coping responses, and mildly impaired social recognition and communication. These results indicate that PCDH10 plays a critical role in excitatory synapse development, but not axon development, in the dorsal BLA and that PCDH10 regulates anxiety-related, fear-related, and stress-related behaviors. Our results reveal the roles of PCDH10 in the brain and its relationship to relevant psychiatric disorders such as ASD, OCD, and MD.",

The PCDH10 protein is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that belongs to the d2-protocadherin family. PCDH10 is highly expressed in the developing brain, especially in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, the role of PCDH10 in vivo has been debatable: one paper reported that a Pcdh10 mutant mouse line showed changes in axonal projections; however, another Pcdh10 mutant mouse line was reported to have failed to detect axonal phenotypes. Therefore, the actual roles of PCDH10 in the brain remain to be elucidated. We established a new Pcdh10"

Instead, we find that Pcdh10 KO mice exhibit impaired development of excitatory synapses in the dorsal BLA. We further demonstrate that male Pcdh10 KO mice exhibit reduced anxiety-related behaviors, impaired fear conditioning, decreased stress-coping responses, and mildly impaired social recognition and communication. These results indicate that PCDH10 plays a critical role in excitatory synapse development, but not axon development, in the dorsal BLA and that PCDH10 regulates anxiety-related, fear-related, and stress-related behaviors. Our results reveal the roles of PCDH10 in the brain and its relationship to relevant psychiatric disorders such as ASD, OCD, and MD.\nKey words: autism spectrum disorder; basolateral nucleus of the amygdala; fear and anxiety; obsessive-compulsive disorder; PCDH10; synapse development\nSignificance Statement\nProtocadherin-10 (PCDH10) encodes a cell adhesion molecule and is implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depression (MD). PCDH10 is highly expressed in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, the phenotypes of previously published Pcdh10 mutant mice are debatable, and some are possibly because of the nonspecific effects of the LacZ/Neo cassette inserted in the mice. We have generated a new Pcdh10 mutant mouse line without the LacZ/Neo cassette. Using our new mouse line, we reveal the roles of PCDH10 for excitatory synapse development in the BLA. The mutant mice exhibit anxiety-related, fear-related, and stress-related behaviors, which are relevant to ASD, OCD, and MD, suggesting a possible treatment strategy for such psychiatric disorders."

Various human genes are implicated in ASD susceptibility. One of them is the Protocadherin-10 (PCDH10) gene (Toro et al., 2010; SFARI, Score 3). Homozygous deletions in the regulatory region of the PCDH10 gene and copy number variants of the PCDH10 gene have been found in ASD patients (Morrow et al., 2008; Bucan et al., 2009). The PCDH10 gene is also implicated in OCD. Whole-genome association analysis showed that PCDH10 variations are linked to SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) treatment response in OCD (Qin et al., 2016). In addition, PCDH10 is identified as one of the genes associated with major depression (MD; Roberson-Nay et al., 2020). Thus, investigating the role of PCDH10 and the neural circuits and behavior regulated by PCDH10 will shed light on the understanding of ASD and co-occurring conditions.\nThe PCDH10 gene encodes a single transmembrane protein that belongs to the d 2-protocadherin family (Redies et al., 2005). PCDH10 mediates calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion by homophilic binding through its extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. In culture, PCDH10 has been shown to regulate contact-mediated cell migration (Nakao et al., 2008) and MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2)-mediated synapse elimination (Tsai et al., 2012). In contrast, the role of PCDH10 in vivo is debatable. One paper reported that a homozygous Pcdh10 mutant (Pcdh10LacZ/Neo KO) line, in which a LacZ/ Neo cassette was inserted to disrupt the first exon of the Pcdh10 gene, showed changes in axonal projections, including striatal and thalamocortical projections (Uemura et al., 2007). Heterozygous Pcdh10LacZ/Neo mice showed sociability defects (Schoch et al., 2017) and altered g oscillations (Port et al., 2017). In addition, Pcdh10LacZ/Neo KO mice are postnatally lethal. However, a review paper stated that analysis of another Pcdh10 KO mouse line, which was generated independently, failed to detect axonal growth phenotypes (Hayashi and Takeichi, 2015). We posit that the axonal defects of the homozygous Pcdh10LacZ/Neo mice are possibly because of the LacZ/Neo cassette inserted into the mouse line. This is based on an earlier Pcdh17 KO mouse line that we generated. We first generated Pcdh17LacZ/Neo mice, in which a LacZ/Neo cassette was inserted to disrupt the first exon of the Pcdh17 gene (Hoshina et al., 2013, see their Fig. S3). We found that this line showed various brain abnormalities including striatal axonal growth defects. However, after removing the LacZ/Neo cassette, the striatal axonal growth phenotypes were no longer observed (Hoshina et al., 2013, see their Fig. S3), suggesting that the LacZ/Neo cassette had nonspecific effects on axon targeting. Therefore, the precise roles of PCDH10 in the brain remain to be elucidated.\nHere, we generated a new Pcdh10 KOmouse line, which does not have a LacZ/Neo cassette, to re-evaluate the role of PCDH10 in the brain. Our Pcdh10 / mice are not lethal and do not show defects in striatal axonal growth. Instead, we found defects in synapse development in the BLA, where PCDH10 is highly expressed. Consistently, our Pcdh10 / mice showed altered anxiety and fear conditioning, which require BLA function. Pcdh10 / mice also appear to show changes in social recognition and social communication, although sociability seemed normal. Our results reveal that the role of PCDH10 is in synapse, but not axon, development. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the importance of PCDH10 in the regulation of anxiety, fear, and social recognition/communication, which is consistent with the involvement of PCDH10 in ASD and co-occurring conditions."

Images were obtained with the identical acquisition settings regarding the exposure time, laser power, detector gain, and amplifier offset. For wide-field imaging with a BZ-X810 fluorescence microscope, images were obtained by stitching several adjacent images together. The average signal intensity was quantified using ImageJ. The ROIs analyzed are as follows: the total area of the striatum, GPe, GPi, and SNr (DARPP-32); the total area of the striatum (TH); the total area of the cerebral cortex, striatum, internal capsule, and thalamus (neurofilament); the total area of the ec (external capsula: cortical input axons) and ic (internal capsula: thalamic input axons; neurofilament); the total area of the BLA (MAP2); and the total area of the dorsal BLA and ventral BLA (VGLUT1, VGLUT2, VGAT). For images with DARPP-32 and TH staining, the signal intensity in the corpus callosum was calculated as the background signal. For images with neurofilament and MAP2 staining, the signal intensity in the fiber-poor regions in the striatum and the internal capsule, respectively, were calculated as the background signal. For images with VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and VGAT staining, the signal intensity in the optic nerve was calculated as the background signal. The background signals were subtracted from the signal intensities in the ROIs. The mean value of the background-subtracted signal intensities was calculated from Pcdh101/1 mice. This mean intensity was set as 100%. All data points of the background subtracted signal intensities from Pcdh101/1 and Pcdh10 / mice were then normalized to the mean value, expressed as the percentage relative to the mean from Pcdh101/1 mice (%1/1), and plotted in the graphs. For colocalization experiments, confocal images at 1024 1024 pixels were acquired as a single plane using a 63 objective lens with a 2.0 zoom. % colocalization of synaptic marker proteins with PCDH10 was quantified using ImageJ (Hoshina et al., 2021). The background intensity was calculated and subtracted from images using the Auto Threshold plugin. For % colocalization analysis, background-subtracted binary images were prepared, and the PCDH10 binary image was overlaid onto the synaptic protein image (\u201cactual\u201d). For correlation analysis, the 180\u00b0- rotated PCDH10 image was overlaid onto the synaptic protein image (\u201crotated\u201d). Puncta were considered colocalized if .10% of a PCDH10 punctum was overlapped with a synaptic punctum (Hoshina et al., 2021). The total number of synaptic puncta and the number of PCDH10-colocalized synaptic puncta were counted, and % colocalization was calculated. Puncta smaller than 6 pixels were excluded from analysis. Colocalization of PSD95 and VGLUT1 was quantified using ImageJ. The background intensity was calculated and subtracted from images using the Auto Threshold plugin. Background-subtracted binary images were prepared, and the PSD95 binary image was overlaid onto the VGLUT1 binary image. The total number of PSD95 puncta and the number of PSD95 puncta with VGLUT1 puncta were counted, and % of PSD95 puncta with VGLUT1 puncta was calculated. In the same way, the total number of VGLUT1 puncta and the number of VGLUT1 puncta with PSD95 puncta were counted, and % of PSD95 puncta with VGLUT1 puncta was calculated.

Images were obtained with the identical acquisition settings regarding the exposure time, detector gain, and amplifier offset. The number of GFP-labeled hippocampus-BLA projections and the number of axon bundles in the distal regions of hippocampus-BLA axons were quantified using ImageJ. For this, the signal intensity in the GFP negative areas of the image was calculated as the background signal. For the number of GFP-labeled axons, the GFP fluorescence intensity along the dotted line drawn on the bundles of axon fibers was analyzed. The number of GFP signal peaks was counted after background signal subtraction. For the number of axon bundles in the distal regions, the GFP fluorescence intensity along the solid line at a 200-mm distance from the medial edge of the BLA was analyzed. Axonal signals with three consecutive peaks within 20mm were considered to be one axonal bundle (Zhu et al., 2016). Analyses of dendritic spines were performed by an individual blind to the genotype. The number of dendritic spines in the image was counted manually. The number of dendritic spines was divided by the dendrite length to calculate the density. Spines were classified into the following categories according to previous reports (Sorra and Harris, 2000; Johnson-Venkatesh et al., 2015): (1) Filopodia, where the neck length was.1.5mm; (2) Thin, where the head width was ,0.5mm; (3) Mushroom, where the head width was .0.5mm; and (4) Stubby, where the neck was absent.\nFluorescent in situ hybridization Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed with an RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics).

            "text": "The test was conducted in a touchscreen operant chamber, equipped with an infrared touch screen, a black mask with two windows, a liquid dipper, and a reward tray (Lafayette Instrument). Mice could access 10% condensed milk (Borden Sugar Condensed Eagle Brand Milk) as a reward from the reward tray. The operant chamber is controlled using ABET II (Lafayette Instrument) and Whisker (Lafayette Instrument) software. The body weights of mice were slowly reduced and maintained to 85% of free-feeding weight by restricted feeding throughout testing. During restricted feeding, mice could access ;2 g of regular mouse chow per day. The visual test involved three stages. Mice were required to meet a set criterion for each stage before proceeding to the next stage. In stage 1, mice were placed in the chamber for 60min and exposed to 200ml of condensed milk in the reward tray. Once mice had consumed all the milk in 60min, they proceeded to the next stage. In stage 2, the mice were trained to collect a milk reward (20ml each time) from the reward tray, after the following cues: a tone and illumination of the tray light. After the reward was collected, the tray illumination turned off, and a 30-s ITI was initiated before the delivery of the next reward. Mice that successfully completed 30 trials in 60min proceeded to the next stage. In stage 3, mice were trained to touch visual stimuli that were randomly presented in one of the two spatial locations on the screen. Various shapes were used for the visual stimuli. If mice touch the blank screen, no reward was given. Touching the visual stimulus resulted in its disappearance accompanied by delivery of the reward, a tone, and tray illumination. Reward collection turned off the tray illumination and initiated an ITI of 10 s before the next trial. Mice that successfully completed 30 trials in 60min were considered to have met the criterion in stage 3. The days to the criterion were quantified.\nExperimental design and statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. The statistical tests performed were two-tailed Student\u2019s t test, two-way ANOVA, or two-way repeated measured ANOVA as indicated in the results and figure legends. Two-way ANOVA and two-way repeated measured ANOVA were followed by Sidak\u2019s post hoc test. All data are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Sample sizes (n) are indicated in the figure legends. Our sample sizes were similar to those reported in previous publications in the field (Umemori et al., 2004; Hoshina et al., 2013, 2021). Significance was set as *p, 0.05, **p, 0.01, or ***p, 0.005 for all data. Post hoc statistical calculation of sample sizes for behavioral experiments was also done to ensure that sample sizes had sufficient power for subsequent statistical analyses (at least 75% power at the 0.05 level of significance for each set of experiments). Steps in the experiments were randomized to minimize the effects of confounding variables, including how mice were chosen for experiments, order of treatments, etc. Imaging was done in the same fashion among conditions. For quantification, cells and fields from brain sections were chosen randomly from the region of interest. No data points were excluded from any experiments."

            "text": "Generation of a new Pcdh10 KOmouse line without a LacZ/ Neo cassette To reveal the actual roles of PCDH10 in the brain, we generated a new Pcdh10 KO mouse line without a LacZ/Neo cassette, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In order to avoid any interference from the artificial gene insertion, we simply deleted the coding region of exon 1 (Fig. 1A,B), which encodes the extracellular and transmembrane domains of PCDH10. The deletion of the coding region of exon 1 was confirmed by genomic PCR (Fig. 1C). The absence of the PCDH10 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1D) and immunostaining. Our Pcdh10 mutant mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, developed normally, and were fertile. This is different from the previously reported Pcdh10LacZ/Neo KO mice which die prematurely (Uemura et al., 2007), suggesting that the LacZ/Neo cassette in the Pcdh10LacZ/Neo KO mice had nonspecific effects on their survival.\nPCDH10 is dispensable for the growth of striatal and nigrostriatal axons Because the previously reported Pcdh10LacZ/Neo KO mice exhibited impaired striatal axonal growth (Uemura et al., 2007), we first examined the growth of striatal axons in our Pcdh10 KO (Pcdh10 / ) mice. Striatal axons and their terminals were visualized by staining for DARPP-32 (Ouimet and Greengard, 1990). DARPP-32 signal intensities in the striatum and its target regions, the GPe (external globus pallidus), GPi (internal globus pallidus), and SNr (substantia nigra reticulata), were similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice, suggesting that striatal axonal growth is normal in the absence of PCDH10 (Fig. 2A; p= 0.8724, t(16) = 0.1632 for GPe; p= 0.9432, t(11) = 0.07,288 for GPi; p=0.1982, t(16) = 1.343 for SNr; t test). High-magnification images between the GPi and SNr show that striatal axon fasciculation is also similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 2A). We then examined nigrostriatal axonal projections, because the previously reported Pcdh10LacZ/Neo KO mice also showed abnormal nigrostriatal axonal projections. TH was used to visualize nigrostriatal axons. TH intensities in the striatum were similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice, suggesting that nigrostriatal axonal growth is also normal in the absence of PCDH10 (Fig. 2B; p=0.8993, t(16) = 0.1286; t test). Furthermore, high-magnification images around the GPe show that dopaminergic axon fasciculation is also similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KOmice (Fig. 2B). In addition, we examined overall axonal distributions around the striatum by staining for neurofilament. Our quantification suggests that axonal distributions in the cerebral cortex, striatum, internal capsule, and thalamus are normal in Pcdh10 KOmice (Fig. 2C; p= 0.6660, t(15) = 0.4403 for Ctx; p=0.5586, t(15) = 0.5982 for Str; p= 0.3777, t(15) = 0.9091 for int; p=0.5141, t(15) = 0.6682 for Th; t test). Altogether, our Pcdh10 KO mice do not show abnormal axonal growth, which contrasts with the previously reported Pcdh10LacZ/Neo KO mice (Uemura et al., 2007). Our results indicate that PCDH10 does not play an important role in axon growth.\nPCDH10 is localized at synapses in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) To re-examine the functions of PCDH10, we first investigated the localization of PCDH10 in the brain. Immunostaining for PCDH10 showed that PCDH10 proteins are widely expressed throughout the brain, but its expression levels are particularly\nhigh in the amygdala (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with a previous report (Aoki et al., 2003). In the amygdala, PCDH10 expression was higher in the BLA than lateral amygdala (LA; Fig. 3B). Interestingly, PCDH10 expression was higher in the dorsal BLA than the ventral BLA, showing a gradient expression pattern. This gradient expression pattern was observed both at P10 and P56, suggesting that PCDH10 plays critical roles in the dorsal BLA during development and adulthood. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that the expression of Pcdh10 mRNA is high in the dorsal BLA (Fig. 3C), consistent with the PCDH10 protein localization (Fig. 3B). BLA neurons receive inputs from various regions in the brain, including the BLA itself, LA, prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and thalamus (Humeau et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2021). Pcdh10 mRNAs were also detected in these brain regions (Fig. 3C), suggesting that PCDH10 may regulate the connections between these regions and the BLA. We next examined whether PCDH10 is localized at synapses in the BLA. PFC-BLA, hippocampus-BLA, LA-BLA, and BLA-BLA connections are VGLUT1-positive excitatory synapses; thalamus-BLA connections are VGLUT2-positive excitatory synapses; and inhibitory synapses within the BLA are VGAT positive. Hence, we stained BLA sections for PCDH10, VGLUT1/VGLUT2/VGAT (presynaptic markers), and PSD95/gephyrin (postsynaptic markers for excitatory and inhibitory synapses; Fig. 3D\u2013H). PCDH10 staining showed a punctate pattern in the BLA. PCDH10 co-localized with VGLUT1/PSD95positive excitatory synapses (Fig. 3E,H; p, 0.0001, t(12) = 12.96 for VGLUT1/PCDH10; p, 0.0001, t(12) = 12.54 for PSD95/ PCDH10; t test), VGLUT2/PSD95-positive excitatory synapses\n(Fig. 3F,H; p, 0.0001, t(12) = 8.897 for VGLUT2/PCDH10; t test), and VGAT/gephyrin-positive inhibitory synapses (Fig. 3G, H; p, 0.0001, t(12) = 11.74 for VGAT/PCDH10; p, 0.0001, t(12) = 11.91 for gephyrin/PCDH10; t test). These results suggest that PCDH10 is generally localized at synapses, including both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, in the BLA, suggesting that PCDH10 may regulate synapse development, maintenance, and function in the BLA.\nAxon projections and dendritic spines are normal in the BLA of Pcdh10 KOmice We then evaluated the development of neuronal connections in the BLA in Pcdh10 KO mice. We first examined axonal projections to the BLA (Fig. 4A). Cortical inputs and thalamic inputs to the BLA were visualized by neurofilament staining as the external capsula (ec) and intermediate capsula (ic), respectively (Fig. 4B). Quantification of staining intensities suggests that these inputs are normal in Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 4B; p= 0.6029, t(14) =\n0.5323 for ec; p= 0.9678, t(14) = 0.04,105 for ic; t test). We next used the Thy1-GFP-M line, in which GFP is expressed in axon fibers of the hippocampus-BLA projections (Fig. 4C). We found that the number of GFP positive hippocampus-BLA axons (p=0.8738, t(26) = 0.1604; t test) and the number of axon bundles in the distal hippocampus-BLA projections (p=0.6407, t(26) = 0.4722; t test) were similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that PCDH10 does not play critical roles in the targeting and fasciculation of axon projections to the BLA.\nTo evaluate the dendrites of BLA neurons in Pcdh10 KO mice, we first stained the BLA sections for MAP2, a dendritic marker. The intensity of MAP2 in the BLA was similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 4D; p =0.5388, t(14) = 0.6301; t test). To examine dendritic spines, we again used the Thy1-GFP-M line. In the Thy1-GFP-M line, a small population of BLA pyramidal neurons is labeled with GFP. By mating Pcdh10 KO mice with the Thy1-GFP-M line, we assessed\ndendritic spine development in the BLA. We found that the density and maturation of dendritic spines are not significantly different between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 4E; p= 0.5994, t(59) = 0.5281 for spine density; p. 0.05 for each spine classification; t test). These results suggest that PCDH10 does not regulate dendrite and spine development in the BLA.\nSynaptic defects in the BLA of Pcdh10 KOmice We next investigated synapse development in the BLA of Pcdh10 KOmice. Because PCDH10 is localized at VGLUT1-positive and\n/\nimages. n= 7 fields from 3\u20134 WT mice for actual and rotated images (E\u2013G). The scale bars are 1 mm (A), 0.5 mm (B, C), and 10mm (E\u2013G). Data are mean 6 SEM; ***p, 0.005; Student\u2019s t test (H). Str, striatum; Amy, amygdala; LA, lateral amygdala; BLA, basolateral nucleus of the amygdala.\nVGLUT2-positive excitatory synapses as well as VGAT-positive inhibitory synapses (Fig. 3), we examined these three types of synapses in the BLA at P28, at the end of synapse development. To evaluate presynaptic development, we quantified VGLUT1positive, VGLUT2-positive, and VGAT-positive puncta in the BLA. The intensities of VGLUT1 puncta were significantly decreased in the dorsal BLA in Pcdh10 KO mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 5A,B; p= 0.0230, t(26) = 2.417; t test). There also seems to be a decrease in the intensity of VGLUT1 puncta in the ventral BLA in Pcdh10 KO mice, but the decrease was not significant (p=0.1321, t(26) = 1.555; t test). These results are consistent with the relatively higher expression levels of PCDH10 in the dorsal BLA than ventral BLA (Fig. 3B). The intensities of VGLUT2-positive and VGAT-positive puncta in the BLA were not significantly different between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice in both the dorsal and ventral BLA (Fig. 5C,D; p. 0.05 for VGAT and VGLUT2 intensities; t test). We also examined the densities and sizes of puncta for VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and VGAT in the dorsal and ventral BLA at P28 (Fig. 5E\u2013H). Although the average intensity for VGLUT1 was significantly decreased only in the dorsal BLA (Fig. 5B), we found that the density and size of VGLUT1 puncta were decreased both in the dorsal BLA and ventral BLA of Pcdh10 KO mice at P28 (Fig. 5F; p, 0.0001, t(36) = 4.509, density in dorsal BLA; p=0.0010, t(36) = 3.573, size in dorsal BLA; p=0.0096, t(36) = 2.735, density in ventral BLA; p=0.0318, t(36) = 2.234, size in ventral BLA; t test). The decrease was more robust in the dorsal BLA than ventral BLA in Pcdh10 KOmice. VGLUT2 and VGAT puncta were not significantly different by any measured criteria between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 5G,H; p. 0.05; t test). These results suggest that PCDH10 primarily regulates the development of VGLUT1-positive, but not VGLUT2-positive or VGAT-positive, presynaptic terminals in the BLA. To evaluate postsynaptic development, we performed staining for PSD95 and gephyrin in the dorsal and ventral BLA at P28 (Fig. 5E,I,J). We found that the density and size of PSD95 puncta were significantly decreased in the dorsal BLA, but not in the ventral BLA of Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 5I; p= 0.0017, t(38) = 3.370, density in dorsal BLA; p= 0.0028, t(38) = 3.197, size in dorsal BLA; p=0.6483, t(38) = 0.4598, density in ventral BLA; p= 0.6215, t(38) = 0.4978, size in ventral BLA; t test). The density and size of gephyrin puncta were similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 5J; p=0.7428, t(38) = 0.3306, density in dorsal BLA; p=0.1271, t(38) = 1.560, size in dorsal BLA; p= 0.2840, t(34) = 1.089, density in ventral BLA; p=0.5472, t(34) = 0.6081, size in ventral BLA; t test). These results suggest that postsynaptic development of excitatory synapses, but not inhibitory synapses, is impaired in the BLA of Pcdh10 KOmice. We also examined the colocalization of VGLUT1 and PSD95 puncta in the dorsal BLA of wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice. We found that the percentage of PSD95 colocalized with VGLUT1 was significantly decreased in Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 5K; p= 0.0003, t(24) = 4.234). Altogether, our results suggest that PCDH10 regulates synaptic development of VGLUT1-positive excitatory synapses in the BLA.\nTo further characterize the synaptic defects in Pcdh10 KO mice, we performed electrophysiological analysis of synapses in the BLA at P28. We recorded mEPSCs from BLA neurons (entire BLA, with more cells located in the dorsal than ventral BLA). The frequency of mEPSCs appeared reduced in Pcdh10 KO mice (p=0.2335, t(106) = 1.198; t test), while the amplitude of mEPSC was not changed in Pcdh10 KO mice (p= 0.6120, t(149) = 0.5082; t test; Fig. 5L). We then recorded and compared the frequency of mEPSCs in dorsal BLA and ventral BLA neurons. Although not statistically significant, the mEPSC frequency seems to be decreased in the dorsal BLA, but not in the ventral BLA (Fig. 5M; p=0.4638 and 0.2770, respectively; t test). These results suggest that the presynaptic function of excitatory synapses is impaired in Pcdh10 KO mice. We also recorded mIPSCs from dorsal BLA neurons in wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice. We found that, while immunostaining for inhibitory synaptic markers (VGAT and gephyrin) did not show any changes, the amplitude of mIPSCs is significantly decreased in Pcdh10 KO neurons (Fig. 5N; p=0.0083, t(91) = 2.699; t test). These results may suggest that changes at excitatory synapses are influencing inhibitory synaptic function.\nBecause immunostaining for VGLUT1 at P28 showed that the density and size of VGLUT1 puncta are decreased both in the dorsal and ventral BLA in Pcdh10 KO mice relative to wildtype mice (Fig. 5F), we examined VGLUT1 puncta earlier, at P14, during synapse formation. We found that the density and size of VGLUT1 puncta are significantly decreased in the dorsal BLA, but not in the ventral BLA, in Pcdh10 KO mice relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 5O; p= 0.0208, t(38) = 2.411, density in dorsal BLA; p=0.0004, t(38) = 3.906, size in dorsal BLA; p=0.2423, t(38) = 1.188, density in ventral BLA; p= 0.0569, t(38) = 1.964, size in ventral BLA; t test). These results suggest that during synapse formation (P14), PCDH10 primarily organizes synapses in the dorsal BLA, but not in the ventral BLA. Defects in synapse development in the dorsal BLA (at P14) may contribute to subsequent changes in the ventral BLA synapses (at P28).\nReduced anxiety-related behaviors in Pcdh10 KOmice Synapses in the dorsal BLA controls negative emotional behaviors such as anxiety-related behaviors (Beyeler et al., 2018) and fear-related behaviors (Kim et al., 2016). Because Pcdh10 KO\n/\nBLA are decreased in Pcdh10 / mice relative to Pcdh101/1 mice (F). The density and size of PSD95 puncta in the dorsal BLA, but not the ventral BLA, are decreased in Pcdh10 / mice relative to Pcdh101/1 mice (I). The density and size of VGAT (H), VGLUT2 (G), and gephyrin (J) in the dorsal BLA and ventral BLA are similar between Pcdh101/1 and Pcdh10 / mice. n=18\u201320 fields from 5 mice per genotype for VGLUT1 in the dorsal and ventral BLA (F). n=18 fields from 4 mice per genotype for VGLUT2 in the dorsal and ventral BLA (G). n=20 fields from 3\u20134 mice per genotype for PSD95 in the dorsal and ventral BLA (H). n= 18\u201320 fields from 3 mice per genotype for gephyrin in the dorsal and ventral BLA (I). n=20 fields from 4 mice per genotype for VGAT in the dorsal and ventral BLA (J). K, Double-staining for VGLUT1/PSD95 in the dorsal BLA of P28 mice. Percentage of PSD95 colocalized with VGLUT1 puncta (% PSD95 with VGLUT1), but not that of VGLUT1 colocalized with PSD95 puncta (% VGLUT1 with PSD95), is decreased in Pcdh10 / mice relative to in Pcdh101/1 mice. n=13 fields from 4 mice per genotype. L, mEPSCs recorded from BLA neurons (entire BLA, with more cells located in the dorsal than ventral BLA) of four- to five-week-old Pcdh101/1 and Pcdh10 / mice. The frequency of mEPSC appears decreased in Pcdh10 / mice relative to in Pcdh101/1 mice. n= 49 cells for Pcdh101/1 and 61 cells for Pcdh10 / from 4 mice, respectively. M, mEPSCs recorded from dorsal and ventral BLA neurons of four- to five-week-old Pcdh101/1 and Pcdh10 / mice. n= 22 cells for Pcdh101/1 and 26 cells for Pcdh10 / from 4 mice in dorsal BLA. n=5 cells for Pcdh101/1 and 9 cells for Pcdh10 / from 4 mice in ventral BLA. N, mIPSCs recorded from dorsal BLA neurons of four- to five-week-old Pcdh101/1 and Pcdh10 / mice. The amplitude of mIPSC is decreased in Pcdh10 / mice relative to in Pcdh101/1 mice. n= 51 cells for Pcdh101/1 and 42 cells for Pcdh10 / from 4 mice, respectively. O, Immunostaining for VGLUT1 in the dorsal BLA and ventral BLA of P14 Pcdh101/1 and Pcdh10 / mice. The density and size of VGLUT1 puncta in the dorsal BLA, but not in the ventral BLA, are decreased in Pcdh10 / mice relative to Pcdh101/1 mice. The scale bars are 100mm (B\u2013D), 10mm (F\u2013J, O), 5mm (K), 10 pA and 25ms (L), and 50 pA and 25ms (N). Data are mean 6 SEM. Arrows and number in the graphs indicate the number of data points greater than the maximum value of the y-axis (L\u2013N). *p, 0.05, **p, 0.01, ***p, 0.005; Student\u2019s t test.\nmice showed synaptic defects in the dorsal BLA, we performed a battery of behavioral tests examining anxiety, fear, and mood, which are also relevant to ASD and co-occurring conditions. We used two- to four-month-old male mice for the behavioral tests (Figs. 6-8) except for the USV test in which pups were used (Fig. 7C).\nWe first examined anxiety-related behaviors. In the elevated plus maze, increases in anxiety-like behaviors manifest as more time spent in the closed arms than in the open arms. Compared with wild-type mice, Pcdh10 KO mice spent significantly more time in the open arms (p=0.0009, t(23) = 3.811; t test) and less time in the closed arms (p=0.0144, t(23) = 2.648; t test), suggesting that Pcdh10 KO mice display reduced anxiety-like behaviors (Fig. 6A). We then performed the light/dark transition test to further evaluate anxiety levels. In this test, the motivation to explore novel areas conflicts with the desire to avoid higher light conditions. Pcdh10 KO mice explored the light area for significantly more time than wild-type mice (Fig. 6B; p = 0.0033, t(23) = 3.275; t test). In addition, the transition number was significantly higher in Pcdh10 KO mice than wild-type mice (Fig. 6B; p = 0.0032, t(23) = 3.285; t test), indicating that Pcdh10 KO mice explored the light area more frequently. These results are consistent with the notion that Pcdh10 KO mice show reduced anxiety-like behaviors.\nTo exclude the possibility that the changes in the anxiety tests are because of defects in visual function in Pcdh10 KO mice, we performed a visual test using touch screen operant chambers, which requires touching a panel in response to visual stimuli. We found no difference in this test between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 6C; p =0.8563, t(21) = 0.1833; t test), suggesting that the vision of Pcdh10 KO mice is normal. Altogether, these results indicate that anxiety levels are reduced in Pcdh10 KO mice.\nImpaired fear conditioning in Pcdh10 KOmice We next examined fear-related behaviors. For this, we conducted contextual and cued fear conditioning tests. On day 1, mice received a foot shock associated with a conditioned tone three times in a contextual chamber (conditioning session). On day 2, mice were returned to the same contextual chamber, and freezing responses were monitored (contextual test). On day 3, mice were put in a different contextual chamber, then the conditioned tone was presented, and freezing responses were monitored (cued test). On the conditioning day, Pcdh10 KO mice showed significantly decreased freezing responses relative to wild-type mice as they receive foot shocks (Fig. 6D; p= 0.0010, F(1,23) = 14.10; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA). Pcdh10 KO mice also showed decreased freezing levels both in the contextual test and cued test compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 6D; p=0.0005, F(1,23) = 16.38, contextual test; p=0.0001, F(1,23) = 20.89, cued test; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA); however, the Pcdh10 KO mice did show freezing responses to the level that they were conditioned on day 1. These results suggest that Pcdh10 KO mice exhibit impaired fear acquisition, but have relatively normal fear memory.\nTo exclude the possibility that decreased pain sensitivity in Pcdh10 KO mice underlies their defects in fear conditioning, we performed a hot plate test to assess their sensitivity to a painful stimulus. We found no significant difference in the withdrawal latency between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 6E; p=0.0638, t(23) = 1.947; t test), suggesting that the pain sensitivity of Pcdh10mice is normal.\nWe also examined the phenotype of Pcdh10 heterozygous (Pcdh101/ ) mice by performing the fear conditioning test. We found that during conditioning, Pcdh101/ mice showed a slightly reduced freezing response, between the second and third foot shocks, compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 6F; p, 0.0100, for 5\u20136min, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by the Sidak\u2019s test). The freezing response after the third foot shock was comparable between wild-type and Pcdh101/ mice. Freezing responses during the context and cued tests were not different between wild-type and Pcdh101/ mice (Fig. 6F; p = 0.3834, F(1,9) = 0.8396, contextual test; p = 0.6963, F(1,9) = 0.1624; cued test; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA). These results suggest that Pcdh101/ mice show a mild impairment in fear acquisition.\nDecreased stress-coping responses in Pcdh10 KOmice To assess the stress-coping style of Pcdh10 KO mice, we tested the mice with the tail suspension test and the forced swim test. In these tests, increased immobility during the tests is correlated with an increase in passive stress-coping behaviors. In the tail suspension test, Pcdh10 KO mice were significantly less immobile than wild-type mice [p = 0.0116, F(1,23) = 7.521, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (Fig. 6G, left); p = 0.0116, t(23) = 2.742, t test (Fig. 6G, right)]. However, in the forced swim test, wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice showed a similar amount of immobility time [p = 0.9669, F(1,23) = 0.001758, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (Fig. 6H, left); p = 0.9669, t(23) = 0.04,193, t test (Fig. 6H, right)]. In the tail suspension and forced swim test, immobility is induced by different types of stress. For example, tail suspension involves hemodynamic stress (Cryan et al., 2005). Our results suggest that Pcdh10 KO mice exhibit decreased passive coping with certain types of stress, such as tail suspension.\nReduced social recognition and social communication in Pcdh10 KOmice We then asked whether Pcdh10 KO mice show ASD-like behaviors, such as impaired social interaction and recognition, altered social communication, and repetitive behaviors. We first performed the three-chamber social interaction test to examine the sociability of mice. For this, we examined whether mice display a preference for a stranger mouse (S) to an empty (E) cage. We found that both wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice spent more time around a stranger cage than an empty cage (Fig. 7A; p, 0.0001, t(22) = 6.340, wild-type; p, 0.0001, t(22) = 9.118, KO; t test). The preference index was similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice, suggesting that social interaction is normal in Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 7A; p= 0.5448, t(22) = 0.6152; t test). After the social interaction test, a novel mouse (N) was introduced into the previously empty cage. In this social recognition test, the stranger mouse (S) in the social interaction test would now become the familiar mouse (F). We found that both wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice spent more time around the novel mouse than the familiar mouse (Fig. 7A; p=0.0001, t(22) = 4.672, wild-type; p=0.0100, t(22) = 2.820, KO; t test). However, the preference index appears to be decreased in Pcdh10 KO mice relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 7A; p=0.0516, t(22) = 2.058; t test). These results suggest that Pcdh10 KO mice may display normal social interaction, but reduced social recognition.\nWe next examined repetitive behaviors by monitoring grooming and rearing. The grooming duration (p = 0.7424, t(23) = 0.3326; t test) and rearing number (p = 0.7492, t(23) = 0.3235; t test) were similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO\n*\n*** A Elevated plus maze test B Light/dark transition test\n***\n***\n***\nC Visual test\nmice, suggesting that Pcdh10 KO mice do not show abnormal repetitive behaviors (Fig. 7B).\nWe then performed the USV test to evaluate social communication. P6 to P8 male pups were separated from their mother and placed alone in a USV chamber, and total USV calls were recorded. We found that the total USV calls appear to be decreased in Pcdh10 KOmice relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 7C; p=0.1258, t(23) = 1.586; t test). These results suggest that Pcdh10 KOmice may show reduced social communication.\nNormal sensory and motor behaviors in Pcdh10 KOmice Finally, we examined whether sensory and motor functions are altered in Pcdh10 KOmice. For this, we first performed the open field test to examine spontaneous locomotor activity. We monitored the distance traveled in the open field box. The distance traveled was not significantly different between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 8A; p=0.1405, t(23) = 1.527; t test), suggesting that spontaneous locomotor activity is normal in Pcdh10 KO mice. We next conducted the accelerating rotarod test to examine motor learning. The retention time on the accelerating rotarod across six trials was similar between wildtype and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 8B; p. 0.05 for each trial; t test), suggesting that motor learning ability is normal in Pcdh10 KO mice.\nWe then performed ASR and PPI tests to examine sensorimotor information processing in Pcdh10 KO mice. In the ASR test, startle responses were similar between wild-type and Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 8C; p. 0.05 for each startle stimulus; t test). In the PPI test, Pcdh10 KO mice exhibited similar levels of PPI\ncompared with wild-type mice (Fig. 8D; p. 0.05 for each prepulse level; t test). These results suggest that startle response to sensory stimulation and sensorimotor gating ability are normal in Pcdh10 KO mice. Altogether, Pcdh10 KO mice have normal sensory and motor functions."

In contrast, our newly generated Pcdh10 KO mice did not show axonal defects at P28 (Fig. 2) and were healthy and fertile. We postulate that some of the phenotypes in Pcdh10LacZ/Neo KO mice might have been because of the LacZ/ Neo cassette inserted in the mouse line. It is known that the insertion of a Neo cassette could interfere with the expression of the target gene and surrounding genes (Pham et al., 1996; M\u00fcller, 1999). In addition, b -galactosidase expression from the LacZ gene may cause cellular toxicity (Kimura et al., 1994; Detrait et al., 2002; Krestel et al., 2004). Indeed, a Pcdh17 KO"

            "text": "mouse line we have previously generated, which initially had a LacZ/Neo cassette, showed multiple brain abnormalities including axon defects; however, after removing the LacZ/Neo cassette, these abnormalities disappeared (Hoshina et al., 2013). Thus, we suggest our newly generated Pcdh10 KO mouse line without the LacZ/Neo cassette reveal the actual functions of PCDH10: PCDH10 regulates synapse development, but not axon growth.\nPCDH10-dependent excitatory synapse development We found that PCDH10 is localized at synapses and regulates synapse development. In the BLA, PCDH10 is localized at VGLUT1-positive and VGLUT2-positive excitatory synapses as well as inhibitory synapses (Fig. 3D\u2013H). Interestingly, Pcdh10 KO mice showed differential effects on different types of synapses. For example, among excitatory synapses, VGLUT1-positive, but not VGLUT2-positive, synapses are affected in Pcdh10 KO mice (Fig. 5). Thus, there is some specificity in terms of the roles of PCDH10 at synapses. Several synapse organizing molecules regulate synapse development in a synapse type-specific manner (Favuzzi and Rico, 2018; Sanes and Zipursky, 2020). Different fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and neuroligins show differential effects on excitatory or inhibitory synapses (Graf et al., 2004; Chih et al., 2005; Terauchi et al., 2010). In addition, synapse organizing molecules may regulate synapses in a pathway-specific manner. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) regulates the stabilization of the dentate gyrus-CA3 synapses, but not CA3-CA3 synapses (Terauchi et al., 2016). PCDH10 may be regulating synapses in the BLA both in a synapse type-specific and pathway-specific manner.\nWhat might affect the specificity of PCDH10? An interesting regulator of PCDH10 is neural activity. The expression of\nPcdh10 is regulated by neural activity (Morrow et al., 2008). Therefore, PCDH10 might also regulate synapses in an activitydependent manner. In a stable state (like in our experiments on synapses), PCDH10 might mainly regulate VGLUT1-positive excitatory synapses, but in certain situations, it may also regulate VGLUT2-positive excitatory synapses and inhibitory synapses. It would be interesting to test whether PCDH10 serves as a statedependent regulator of synapses in the BLA.\nIt is also worth noting that at P14 (during synapse development), VGLUT1 puncta are only decreased in the dorsal BLA in Pcdh10 / mice (Fig. 5O); however, at P28 (at the end of synapse development), VGLUT1 puncta are decreased both in the dorsal and ventral BLA (Fig. 5F). Thus, defects in excitatory synapse development in the dorsal BLA may contribute to subsequent changes in other synapses in the BLA.\nPCDH10 regulates dorsal BLA synapses and fear-related and anxiety-related behaviors The amygdala controls fear and anxiety, and the BLA is the center for the input and output of such information (Tovote et al., 2015). The BLA integrates cortical, thalamic, hippocampal, and LA inputs and sends outputs to the central amygdala, which connects to various areas of the brain such as the PFC, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens (NAc; Zhang et al., 2021). The BLA can be divided into the dorsal BLA and ventral BLA, which have different combinations of neuronal inputs and outputs (Hintiryan et al., 2021). Accordingly, the dorsal and ventral BLA control different aspects of emotional behaviors. Specifically, the dorsal BLA controls negative emotional behaviors such as fear-related behaviors and anxiety-related behaviors. In contrast, the ventral\nBLA controls positive emotional behaviors such as reward-based behaviors (Kim et al., 2016; Yang and Wang, 2017; Beyeler et al., 2018). We found that PCDH10 is more highly expressed in the dorsal BLA than the ventral BLA (Fig. 3B) and regulates excitatory synapse development in the dorsal BLA (Fig. 5). Consistent with the role of the dorsal BLA in fear-related behaviors and anxiety-related behaviors, Pcdh10 KO mice showed changes in fear conditioning and anxiety. PCDH10-positive synapses in the dorsal BLA may be the synapses responding to negative stimuli such as fear-related and anxiety-related signals and contributing to reducing anxiety and fear levels. Additionally, dorsal BLA neurons send outputs to the NAc and mPFC (Hintiryan et al., 2021), and these connections also regulate fear and anxiety behaviors (Zhang et al., 2021). Since PCDH10 is expressed in the NAc and mPFC as well, alterations in these connections may also contribute to the fear and anxiety phenotypes in Pcdh10 KOmice.\nNote that previously generated Pcdh10LacZ/Neo heterozygous mice showed related but different behavioral phenotypes than our Pcdh10 KO mice (Schoch et al., 2017; Ferri et al., 2021). We posit that the behavioral phenotypes of Pcdh10LacZ/Neo heterozygous mice may reflect the roles of PCDH10-expressing neurons affected by the LacZ/Neo cassette, but may not reflect the exact role of PCDH10 per se"

            "text": "The human PCDH10 gene has been linked to ASD, OCD, and MD (Morrow et al., 2008; Bucan et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2016; Roberson-Nay et al., 2020). The core symptoms of ASD include diminished social motivation, language problems, and restricted/ repetitive behaviors (Kas et al., 2014). In rodent models, social interaction and social recognition tests assess sociability and social novelty preference, which are linked to social motivation. The USV test evaluates rodent social communication skills, which are related to language skills in humans. Rodent grooming and rearing behaviors are related to human restricted/repetitive behaviors. We found that Pcdh10 KO mice show mild impairment in the social recognition test and USV test. Thus, PCDH10 appears to control social novelty preference and social communication skills. Mutations in PCDH10 may lead to the impairment in such skills, exhibiting ASD-related symptoms.\nAdditionally, as described above, Pcdh10 KO mice showed altered anxiety-related and fear-related behaviors. Abnormalities in anxiety and fear are frequently seen in ASD patients, and anxiety disorders and phobias often co-occur with ASD (Evans et al., 2005; White et al., 2009; Maddox and White, 2015; Postorino et al., 2017). OCD\u2019s symptoms include excessive anxiety and fear, and abnormal anxiety and fear are often seen in MD as well (Eysenck and Fajkowska, 2018; Stein et al., 2019). Panic disorder, phobia, anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder are often comorbid with OCD and MD (Pallanti et al., 2011; Stein et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2020). Mouse models of ASD, OCD, and MD also exhibit abnormal anxiety-related and fear-related behaviors (Krishnan and Nestler, 2011; Alonso et al., 2015; Kazdoba et al., 2016). Mutations in PCDH10might alter the regulation of anxiety and fear, exhibiting symptoms related to ASD, OCD, and MD.\nIt is important to note that mutations found in PCDH10 in human ASD are in the 39 region involved in the regulation of PCDH10 expression (Morrow et al., 2008). Therefore, the mutations may either decrease or increase the expression of PCDH10. Pcdh10 KO mice showed reduced anxiety and fear levels, phenotypes that are opposite to the excessive anxiety and fear levels associated with human psychiatric disorders. It is possible that\nASD mutations in PCDH10 were increasing the expression of PCDH10, causing excessive anxiety and fear. As described above, the expression of PCDH10 is regulated by neural activity. Thus, mutations in the 39 region of the PCDH10 gene might also affect the activity-dependent regulation of PCDH10, which may result in altered anxiety, fear, and social motivation/communication."

Currently, SSRIs and benzodiazepines are the most used anxiolytic drugs (Dunlop and Davis, 2008; Tan et al., 2011; Griffin et al., 2013; Stahl, 1998). However, both SSRIs and benzodiazepines have side effects such as insomnia, stomach upset, nausea, diarrhea (Ferguson, 2001), and addiction (Donoghue and Lader, 2010; Tan et al., 2011), causing some patients not to tolerate them. Our study suggests that PCDH10 could be a potential drug target for designing anxiolytics. Interestingly, PCDH10 is implicated in SSRI-resistant OCD (Qin et al., 2016). Therefore, novel drugs targeting PCDH10 may be more effective than SSRIs for certain types of OCD and other psychiatric disorders."
