Participants were selected using a systematic sampling technique. A structured, pre-tested, and interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Binary and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify associated factors. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to show the strength and direction of the association. For the qualitative part, four focused group discussion sessions were done, and participants were selected purposely. Thematic analysis was used to analyze, and the finding was triangulated with quantitative findings.\nResult A total of 146 adolescents (34.6%, 95% CI: (29.9, 38.9)) have experienced pregnancy at least one time. Age (\u2264 16) [AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: (0.27, 0.85)], not attending school [AOR = 3.59, 95% CI: (1.2, 10.8)], having a mother with no history of teenage pregnancy [AOR = 0.45, 95% CI: (0.21, 0.98)], being unmarried [AOR = 0.21, 95% CI: (0.12, 0.36)], and having a sister/s with a history of teenage pregnancy [AOR = 2.22, 95% CI: (1.33, 3.7)] were significantly associated factors.\nConclusion More than one-third of adolescents experience teenage pregnancy. The magnitude of teenage pregnancy was high which may lead to serious health consequences for both the mother and their fetus. Addressing cultural barriers and strengthening adolescent reproductive health education to decrease intergenerational transmission of teenage pregnancy through community awareness and strengthening reproductive parentadolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health communication are important measures to tackle the problem.\nKeywords Teenage, Pregnancy, Factors, Refugee, Kule, Ethiopia"

            "text": "Teenage pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy in girls between the ages of 13 and 19 years old [1]. The Adolescent age is a phase when enormous physical, psychological, and social changes occur. One in five individuals (around 1.2\u00a0billion) in the world is an adolescent [2]. The health and well-being of this age group have important ramifications for the future of nations, regions, and the globe [3].\nTeenage pregnancy is a global problem occurring in high, middle, and low-income countries. It is more likely to occur in marginalized communities, commonly driven by poverty and a lack of education and employment opportunities [4]. About 21\u00a0million adolescent girls aged 15\u201319 years old become pregnant and 19\u00a0 million girls of this age group also give birth in the developing world every year. Near half of these pregnancies were unintended, and more than half ended in unsafe abortion [5].\nIn low- and middle-income countries, as well as areas of conflict, limited resources, and technical abilities have resulted in a widespread state of neglect concerning adolescent reproductive health [6]. Evidence showed that the pooled prevalence of teenage pregnancy was 18.8% in Africa and 19.3% in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [7]. Teenage mothers accounted for more than half of all births in SSA [8, 9]. Despite the decline of global adolescent birth rates from 65 to 47 births per 1000 women between 1990 and 2015, teenage pregnancies remain unacceptably high especially in sub-Saharan Africa [8, 10].\nDespite good progress in reducing the maternal mortality rate (MMR), teenage pregnancy is associated with high maternal mortality and many women are still dying from pregnancy and childbirth-related complications [11]. Moreover, Sustainable Development Goal Three (SDG-3) aims to reduce MMR to less than 70 per 100,000 live births globally by 2030 [12]. Evidence showed that the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in Ethiopia decreased from 16.3% in 2000 to 12.5% [13, 14].\nIn South Sudan, teenage pregnancy is a major challenge affecting girls and young women\u2019s health and their social, economic, and political empowerment. South Sudan is among the 10 countries with the highest prevalence of child marriage with a prevalence of 52% [4]. According to the National Household and Health Survey, one-third of the 15-19-year-old girls in the country have started childbearing and 96% of women of reproductive ages were not using any contraceptive method [15].\nGlobally, around 6.6\u00a0 million adolescents are displaced by war or political conflicts, and a large proportion of this group is living in Africa [16]. Moreover, the statistics show that 90% of the youth in this group experience conflict, poverty, and a lack of opportunity. Within this displaced group, teenage pregnancy is one of the most significant health issues [16, 17].\nEarly pregnancies have major health consequences for adolescent mothers. It results in a major impact concerning health (preeclampsia, Eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, anemia, abortion, and systemic infections), social (stigma, rejection or violence by partners, parents, and peers, divorce, and drop out of school), and economic consequences [5, 18, 19]. It can also increase the risks for newborns. Babies born to mothers under 20 years of age face higher risks of low birth weight, preterm delivery, stillbirth, prematurity, and severe neonatal conditions [20].\nTeenage pregnancy is a major public health problem in Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The situation is worse for girls living in refugee, low-resource settings, characterized by poverty, restricted access to care, weak health systems, lack of education and employment, and weak social safety nets [4]. Evidence on adolescent sexual and reproductive health is vital to support decision-making to advance these initiatives and to develop effective programs addressing adolescents\u2019 needs. Yet, numerous data and research gaps impede these efforts mainly in refugee setup. Thus, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of teenage pregnancy and associated factors in the Kule refugee camp, Gambella, Ethiopia."

All teenagers aged 15\u201318 years old from the selected households were the study population. Teenagers who were unable to interview due to severe medical illness were excluded.\nSample size determination and sampling procedures For the quantitative part, the sample size was calculated using a single population formula (n= (z a/2)2p (1 \u2212 p))/d2), where Z is the normal standard deviation set at 1.96, with a confidence level of 95% and a tolerable\nmargin of error (d) at 5%, 10% non-response rate, and p is the prevalence of teenage pregnancy. Since there was no similar study done in refugee communities of South Sudan that shows the prevalence of teenage pregnancy, the p-value was taken as 0.5 (50%). Based on the formula and substituting the values, it resulted in 384, and adding a 10% nonresponse rate (384 + 384*0.1) resulted in 422. The final sample size used for this study was 422. For the qualitative part, the study involved purposely selecting participants in four focused group discussions (FGDs). The FGD participants were selected from the Refugee Committee Council (RCC), women\u2019s affairs, teenagers, religious leaders, and community key figures. Overall, a total of four focused group discussions (12 members for each FGD) were conducted based on their convenience, accessibility, and knowledge of conveying the information.\nFor the sampling procedure, there were seven zones in the refugee camp with a total of 9417 households. The number of households was considered for each zone and proportion allocation to the sample size was done to identify the required number of households for each zone. The participant was interviewed from the selected household using a systematic sampling technique. The first household was selected using the lottery method, and the next household was identified using a systematic sampling technique every Kth value (22). When more than one eligible teenager was found in the selected household, only one respondent was chosen by the lottery method. In cases where eligible was not found in the selected household, then the next household was taken. For the qualitative part, a purposive sampling technique was used to select the focused group discussants. Four focus group discussions (FDG) were conducted with a total of 48 purposely selected participants.\nData collection tool and procedures The data were collected using pretested, structured, and interviewer-administered questionnaires. The questionnaire was adapted and developed with modifications from similar previous studies [21\u201323]. It consisted of socio-demographic, family-related, behavioral, and reproductive health-related items. It was first prepared in English and then translated into the local language (Nuer) by a language expert (person). Data were collected by seven females (degree holders) and intensive supervision was done by two public health professionals (master holders) throughout the data collection period. For the qualitative part, a phenomenology research design was used in this study [24]. A semi-structured, open-ended, and non-directive focus group discussion guide was used and designed to triangulate responses obtained by the structured questionnaire on attitude and perception toward teenage pregnancy [25, 26]. Two master\u2019s holders\nand two (degree holders) were facilitated FGD. Each group had a facilitator/modulator and recorder/assistant modulator. The facilitator/ moderator interacts with the group, asks questions, and makes notes, and the assistant moderator/recorder handles logistics, arranges the room, welcomes participants as they arrive, takes careful notes, and monitors recording equipment. Data was recorded through radio recordings."

A pretest was done in 5% (21 individuals) of the sample size in the Terkidi Refugee camp, which is not a part of the study area but the same with socio-cultural characteristics with the sample population. Close followup was done by the principal investigators and supervisors during the data collection period.\nFor the qualitative part, before analyzing the data, all FGDs were transcribed verbatim in the Nuer language and then translated into English by the principal investigator and a research assistant to ensure consistency. The one-day training was given for moderators, tape recorders, and note-takers by principal investigators on the discussion guide, the purpose of the study, and the way to interact with participants. The FGD was conducted in the local language of Nuer which is spoken and well understood by all study participants. Simple language with short well-constructed and understandable questions was used in the discussion. All nonverbal communication such as laughter and disagreements by shaking head was also documented. Questions were asked until there was no new information that was generated from the study participants. At the end of FGD, study participants were given an opportunity to ask questions related to the discussion. The group discussion lasted for 55 to 60\u00a0 min. A semicircular seating arrangement was used to ensure there was good communication between the study participants and interviewers. Separate note-takers were involved in the process of notetaking. All persons involved in conducting the session of FGD except the\nmoderator refrained from talking. The note-takers produced notes as exact as possible."

Frequencies, proportions, and summary statistics were used to describe the study population and presented in tables, figures, and narratives. The bivariate analysis was carried out to identify significantly associated variables with the outcome variable. Co-linearity was checked using VIF and a tolerance test was checked to test model fitness. Those Variables in bivariate analysis whose p-value was less than 0.25 were considered candidates for the multivariable analysis. Candidate variables were enrolled in the final model (multivariable analysis) so as not to miss associated factors. Then multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors by controlling the possible confounders. Finally, a variable with a p-value less than 0.05 in the final model was considered statistically significant.\nFor the qualitative part, the data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Information from participants\u2019 descriptions and explanations of their attitudes, opinions, and perceptions towards teenage pregnancy, and reasons for teenage pregnancy was assessed. Raw notes and tape recordings were used to generate transcripts in the local language (Nuer). The principal investigator and research assistant translated and transcribed the notes and recordings and read the transcripts many times to gain a better understanding of the context, and then coding, identification categories, and themes were carried out. The thematic analysis was then triangulated with quantitative findings."

They considered it as a means of income. When a girl gets married there is a payment that the husband should pay to her family. The dowry that is paid for marriage is the cause that adolescent girls are forced to marriage.\n\u201cIn Kule, there are a lot of young girls who are pregnant. When I observed them, I felt very sad because they do not have any access to food and health care. Many causes lead to an increase in the number of adolescent pregnancies in our community. Among those reasons, one is the shortage of property. Adolescents are posing pregnancy in this refugee. When\nwe were in South Sudan, this case was less compared to this area. We lost our family and our property in South Sudan due to the war. Many adolescents including me accepted early marriage because the person that we married would pay a lot of property to our family. To gain these properties that support to our family by the husband by either money, caws and/or whatever our family requested him that is why we married early and become pregnant [18 years old girl, FGD3]\u201d. \u201cWhen you have five and above daughters, you are rich because when they marry you will get dowery.

If the adolescent girl refuses the interest of her family, they punish and neglect her from her family.\n\u201cOh\u2026Jege (not good) \u2026.in our culture the community highly encourages early marriage and having many children. In addition to this, the family restricts you from seeing your child because you are young. The young ladies did not properly care for their children because they are too young, and they do not have knowledge of how to care for the child. They did not give proper nutrition such as breastfeeding because the adolescents spend their time playing with their\nfriends rather than caring for their child because they are too young [17 years old girl, FGD3]\u201d. \u201cWhen girls get married, they do not have any chance except to accept the instruction of the husband and their/his family. If a girl does not marry, she will be neglected by the community and her family especially when she stays until 17 or 18. Some young ladies became pregnant, and their families refused and punished them in my neighborhood and my family. Having a child while you did not marry is risky for violence in our culture [a 49-year-old male, FGD3]\u201d.\nParent-adolescent communication on reproductive health issues Regarding reproductive health-related information, three-fourths (74.6%) of participants reported they received sex education at school. About 42% discussed family planning with their parent, 37.4% discussed unintended pregnancy, 62.8% received family counseling, near to half (47.4%) received sex-related information from their parents (Fig.\u00a02).\nParents role on the discussion and awareness plays an important impact on the future life of adolescent girls. Despite their positive role they also have pressure on early and forced marriage.\n\u201cMothers and other family members have a role in advising their children. But in some ways, the\nmother and the family member have pressure to practice early marriage and to be pregnant. So, all family members should play a role in preventing early marriage. We should not focus only on adolescent girls the issue also needs to be addressed to adolescent boys [45 years old woman, FGD1]\u201d.\nFactors associated with teenage pregnancy In the Binary logistic Regression, age, school attendance, educational status, occupational status, marital status, with whom did she live, educational status (mother), mother history of teenage pregnancy, educational status (father), siter/s history of teenage pregnancy, contraceptive use status, knowledge of emergency contraceptive, access to media and drinking status were significantly associated factors.\nIn the final model (multivariable regression), age, marital status, maternal/sisters\u2019 history of teenage pregnancy and school attendance were significantly associated factors. Adolescents aged below 16 years old were 52% less likely to experience pregnancy (AOR:0.48 (0.27, 0.85)), those who were not attending school were 3.59 times more likely to experience pregnancy (AOR: 3.59 (1.2, 10.8)), teenagers whose mothers have no history of teenage pregnancy were 55% less likely to experience pregnancy (AOR = 0.45 (0.21, 0.98)), those teenagers who did not married were 71% less likely to experience pregnancy (AOR = 0.21 (0.12, 0.36)), and those whose sister/s had a history of teenage pregnancy were 2.2 times more\nlikely to experience (AOR = 2.22 (1.33, 3.7)) compared to those whose sisters have no history of teenage pregnancy (Table\u00a03)."

Age, school attendance, mother\u2019s history of teenage pregnancy, marital status, and sister/s history of teenage pregnancy were significantly associated factors with teenage pregnancy.\nThe magnitude of teenage pregnancy in this study is in line with the findings from Benin (30.2%) and Eastern Ethiopia (30%) [22, 28]. However, it is lower than from studies done in Cameron (60.75%), Malawi (76%), Ethiopia (79.6%), and the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) in Sub-Saharan African countries (44.3%) [27, 29\u201331]. The possible reason for the discrepancy might be due to the difference in study design, sample size, the age of study subjects, and duration of the study. For example, a study in Ethiopia was done on participants aged 20\u201324. The duration of the study done in Sub Sharan Africa was from 2010 to 2018 which varies duration, the study in Cameron was also a clinic-based study in which pregnant were easily accessed antenatal care whereas this study is a community-based study this might be the reason for the discrepancy.\nThe finding of this study is higher than studies done in Canada (4.3%), DHS in East Africa (29%), DHS in Nepal (17.3%), South Africa (19.9%), Wegadi (Ethiopia) (28.6%), DHS in Ethiopia (10%), Arba Minch (7.7%) [21, 23, 32\u2013 36]. The reason for the difference might be due to the difference in the study setting, study subjects, and sample size. For example, in a study in Canada and South Africa, the educational and economic status of these study subjects was different from the refugees. They may have a good education and access to health care whereas in this study participants are refugees who may not access the health and school services compared to South Africa and Canada. The discrepancy might be also due to the study design, example the study in Arba Minch was done in the school whereas this study is a community-based study which may give the chance to access easily to those pregnant who did not attend school and drop out of school due to the pregnancy.\nThis study tried to assess factors associated with teenage pregnancy. Adolescent girls aged 16 and below were 52% less likely to experience pregnancy compared to those aged 17 years old and above. This is consistent with the study done in Ethiopia, Wegedi, Eastern Ethiopia, and DHS in Sub-Saharan Africa [21, 22, 27, 37]. A possible reason for this might be those adolescents aged 17 and above are minor mature and they may increase their interest in having a child compared to those below 16\nyears old. In addition to this, the culture of the community may also be a reason to increase the experience of teenage pregnancy.\nTeenagers who did not marry were 79% less likely to experience pregnancy compared to married teenagers. This is supported by the findings done in Eastern Ethiopia [22]. The possible reason for this might be that those who did not marry may have less risk of practicing sexual intercourse and those married may increase their interest in having a child in addition to the influence of family and partner. In addition to this, the cultural value of the community to marriage may also affect the experience of teenage pregnancy. The other reason might also be that those who are married may not use contraceptives due to the refusal of their partner which may increase the occurrence of pregnancy.\nTeenagers whose mothers have no history of teenage pregnancy were 55% less likely to experience pregnancy compared to those who reported their mothers had a history of teenage pregnancy. This is consistent with the finding from Degua Temben (Ethiopia) [38]. Teenagers who reported that their sister/s had a history of teenage pregnancy were 2.2 times more likely to experience pregnancy compared to those whose sister/s had no history of teenage pregnancy. This is consistent with the study done in Eastern Ethiopia [22]. A possible reason might be that adolescents might share information and experience with their family members. The other possible reason may also be the pressure of their family to marry and have a child.\nIn this study, adolescent girls who were not attending school were 3.59 times more likely to experience pregnancy compared to those who were attending school. This finding is supported by the finding from Eastern Ethiopia [22]. The reason for this may be that those who did not attend school might drop out of school due to family pressure and they may not receive information about the risk of early marriage which may increase the occurrence of pregnancy. Those who attend school may give time to their education and may also have a chance to get information about the consequences of teenage pregnancy in school."
