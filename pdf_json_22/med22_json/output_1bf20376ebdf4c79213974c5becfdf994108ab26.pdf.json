    "abstractText": "Several studies have reported the anti-diabetic effect of biologically synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). This study was designed to investigate the in vivo anti-diabetic activity of AuNPs synthesized using the leaf extract of Dittrichia viscosa in a high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats. AuNPs were synthesized using the leaf extract of D. viscosa, and the synthesized AuNPs were characterized by UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To study the anti-hyperglycemic effect of the AuNPs formed using D. viscosa extract, adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were divided into three groups (6\u20138 rats/group) as follows: control group, a diabetic group without treatment, and a diabetic group treated intraperitoneally with a daily injection of AuNPs at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg for 21 days. Diabetes was induced by maintaining the rats on HFD for 2 weeks, followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of 45 mg/kg of STZ. Serum and liver samples were collected at the end of the treatment period and used to measure glucose levels and hepatic gene expression and activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the rate-limiting enzyme in the liver gluconeogenic pathway. The AuNPs formed using D. viscosa extract were mainly spherical with a size range between 20 and 50 nm with good stability and dispersity, as indicated by the zeta potential and DLS measurements. Treatment with AuNP significantly lowered the blood glucose level, the gene expression, and the activity of hepatic PEPCK in comparison to the diabetic untreated group (P < 0.05). This study suggests that AuNPs synthesized using D. viscosa leaf extract can alleviate hyperglycemia in HFD/STZ-induced diabetes in rats, which could be through the reduction of hepatic gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the expression and activity of the hepatic PEPCK gene.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder with the main characteristic of elevated blood glucose levels, either due to insufficient or lack of insulin secretion, resistance to its action, or both [1, 2]. The most common classifications of DM by etiology and clinical presentation include type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and gestational diabetes [2, 3]. T1DM occurs primarily due to autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing \u03b2 cells in the islets of the pancreas, which accounts for 5\u201310% of cases, while T2DM accounts for ~ 90% of all cases of diabetes [2]. T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance, pancreatic \u03b2 cells dysfunction, and insulin deficiency [3]. In addition, the hepatic gluconeogenic pathway, which synthesizes glucose from * Murtaza M.

Therefore, suppressing the hepatic gluconeogenic pathway is one of the suggested options to manage elevated blood glucose levels, and any compound that can inhibit this pathway can be of therapeutic importance for the management of diabetes.\nNew trends are currently emerging for the management of DM, where nanotechnology has gained significant interest because of the advantages it provides and the success it showed in several areas of medicine. Nanomedicine refers to the use of materials in which at least one of its dimensions is less than 100\u00a0nm [5] for various medical applications, including disease treatment, diagnostic purposes, or understanding of disease mechanisms.\nAmong the recent findings in the field is discovering the anti-diabetic effect of metallic nanoparticles, including gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) [6]. Initial studies on AuNPs have shown promising results in this field in lowering blood glucose and lipid levels and its protective effect against complications associated with diabetes [7\u20139]. Several studies have confirmed the anti-diabetic effect of AuNPs using extracts from different plant sources for their synthesis [10\u201313].\nDittrichia viscosa, also known as false yellow head [14] and initially classified in the Inula genus [15], is commonly used in traditional medicine as an anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial agent [16]. Other studies have also demonstrated its anti-cancer and anti-diabetic effects [17, 18]. To our knowledge, no study has demonstrated the biological synthesis of AuNPs using the extract of D. viscosa; neither their anti-diabetic effect has not been evaluated. Additionally, the effect of AuNPs on the expression and activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic gluconeogenesis has not been studied. This study addressed these issues by evaluating the in\u00a0vivo anti-diabetic activity of AuNPs synthesized using the leaf extract of D. viscosa in HFD/STZ-induced diabetes in rats."

Leaves of D. viscosa were dried in an oven at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight and were stored at room temperature away from light.\nLeaf extract was prepared by adding 1\u00a0g of the dried plant to 100\u00a0ml of boiling water with continuous stirring for 15\u00a0min and then it was kept cooling at room temperature and filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The extract was then added to 1\u00a0mM aqueous HAuCl4 solution at a volume ratio of 1:5 followed by measurement of absorbance at a resolution of 2\u00a0nm and wavelength range between 240 and 800\u00a0nm at 4-h intervals in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1\u00a0cm. After the reaction had completed, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min and the pellet was weighed and resuspended in distilled water.\nSurface charge measurement and the formed NPs hydrodynamic diameter were determined using Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Panalytical, UK), where 100\u00a0\u00b5l of the solution was suspended in 900\u00a0\u00b5l of distilled water. Measurements were taken under the following conditions: 25\u00a0\u00b0C, 1.33 dispersant refractive index, and 0.8872 cP viscosity. The shape of the formed nanoparticles was determined by TEM using a Titan FEI microscope, where the sample was first dispersed in water, deposited on a carbon grid, and allowed to dry prior to imaging."

Rats were divided into three groups (n = 6\u20138/group): control (non-diabetic), diabetic without any treatment, and diabetic treated with a daily intraperitoneal injection of AuNPs at a dose of 2.5\u00a0mg/ kg for 21\u00a0days [9]. Type 2 diabetes was induced by maintaining the rats on HFD for 2\u00a0weeks; the diet consisted of egg yolk and butter mixed with feed. This was followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of freshly prepared STZ (45\u00a0mg/kg) dissolved in 50\u00a0mM sodium citrate buffer (pH\n4.5). Three days following the injection, blood glucose levels were measured in fasting rats using a glucometer (GlucoLab, Infopia, Korea); rats with blood glucose levels higher than 150\u00a0mg/dl were considered diabetic."

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. T2DM occurs because of a combined impairment in insulin secretion (\u03b2 cell failure) and insulin action (insulin resistance) [2, 3, 20]. HFD/STZinduced diabetes in rats is a common model of T2DM. The HFD contributes to hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance caused by obesity, while STZ destroys the pancreatic \u03b2 cells, which are all a characteristic of T2DM [21]. In searching for new, effective, and safe anti-diabetic drugs, AuNPs received tremendous attention as they can be potentially used to manage diabetes [6]. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the in\u00a0vivo anti-diabetic activity of AuNPs synthesized using the leaf extract of D. viscosa in HFD/STZ-induced diabetes in rats.\nIn the current study, a biological approach was used to synthesize the AuNPs, where the leaf extract of D. viscosa was used as a reducing agent. Plant extracts contain several compounds and functional groups that can reduce and stabilize agents in the synthesizing of metallic NPs [22]. This includes flavonoids, terpenoids, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and others that act through different mechanisms to reduce gold ions into AuNPs.\nAuNPs synthesized using plant extract usually have better stability over chemically synthesized AuNPs. In this study, the surface charge was \u2212 29.3\u00a0mV in the aqueous media, indicating good stability of the formed NPs due to repletion between particles and a low possibility of aggregation [23]. The NPs mainly were spherical with a size of between 20 and 50\u00a0nm.\nSeveral studies have reported the anti-diabetic effect of AuNPs in different diabetic animal models, where the effect has been attributed mainly to the anti-oxidant properties exerted by these particles. AuNPs have managed to restore the activity of several anti-oxidant enzymes that are known to be diminished in diabetes and maintain the redox balance [6]. It has also been reported that AuNPs can scavenge free radicals and are ten times more powerful than vitamin E and five times more powerful than vitamin C as an anti-oxidant [24].\nIt was clear that AuNPs managed to significantly lower the serum glucose levels to normal compared to the diabetic group. Several mechanisms have been suggested for the hypoglycemic effect exerted by AuNPs. In one study, AuNPs synthesized using guavanoic acid had an inhibitory effect on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) [25], which is involved in the insulin signaling pathway and is considered a promising target for T2DM management [26]. This eventually leads to enhancing glucose uptake in the muscle and adipose tissue. Other studies showed that AuNPs have an inhibitory effect on some digestive enzymes, including \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase [27, 28], which reduces glucose release. Another study suggested that AuNPs interact with the cysteine residues present in an enzyme involved in regulating oxidative stress known as thioredoxin, thus, preventing an inhibitory protein from binding to it and enhancing their anti-oxidant activity [27].\nAlso, plant extracts are known to act as reducing and capping agents in synthesizing metallic nanoparticles. Therefore, the anti-diabetic agents present in the plant extract, including flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, alkaloids, and others [28], can be concentrated on the surface of the formed NPs, thus improving their anti-diabetic effect. Thus, the effect may be attributed to both the AuNPs, and the hypoglycemic agents present in the plant\u2019s extract. Also, polyphenols, abundant in D. viscosa extract [29], are known to exhibit anti-diabetic effects acting through different mechanisms [30], including inhibiting\n1 3\nglucose absorption in the intestine through inhibiting glucosidase and amylase activity [31], and increasing glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) secretion and its half-life by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and by increasing insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity [32].\nFasting hyperglycemia in T2DM has been shown to be a function of increased hepatic gluconeogenesis [33]. In the current study, the relative mRNA expression and the activity of a key gluconeogenic enzyme, PEPCK, were significantly lowered in the group treated with the AuNPs compared to the diabetic group. The hypoglycemic effect of AuNPs in type 2 diabetes may be due to the suppression of expression of PEPCK. This effect could be due to the ability of AuNP to regenerate the pancreatic cells, therefore, enhancing insulin secretion [34], as it is known that insulin acts as a repressor for PEPCK expression."
