    "abstractText": "The dimensions of the costs and incentives necessary for integrating demand response into the wholesale electricity market are subject to energy policies and bulk system operation. The electricity industry must gain operational flexibility to support the energy transition caused by renewable energy and decarbonization. Complementary services and technologies of demand response programs can be optimized by exploiting the variety of uses of this resource. The main objective of this work is to apply the concept of elasticity of substitution in a strategic demand shift program to promote the integration of renewable energies and the reduction of non-served power, considering an economical and safe generation dispatch. The methodology is analyzed through a case study applied in the Dominican Republic\u2019s electricity market, in which the elasticity of substitution coefficients is used to adjust variations below 10.49% of the base demand in the peak period. These variations reduce the generation operating cost by 8.4%, marginal cost by 30.19%, and non-served power by 19.1% when renewable energy increases by 5%. The inclusion of the cost of CO2 emissions in the simulation of the operating cost function makes the objective function higher than the baseline function. For relative variations in operating cost ranging from 7.27% to 16.03%, the reduction in tons of CO2 equivalent varies from 2.77 to 28.02. This study contextualizes the economic effect of the CO2 emissions control, giving new possibilities to optimize system operation and the wholesale electricity market based on demand response programs that encourage flexible consumption, with favorable economic and environmental results. INDEX TERMS CO2 emissions, demand response, the elasticity of substitution, renewable energy, wholesale electricity market.",

INTRODUCTION The design of energy policies to integrate new technologies must include economic, social, and environmental perspectives to ensure the future development of electrical systems and market performance. These policies require mechanisms or profitable instruments to adapt to technologies, business models, and traditional electrical operations. This adaptation implies integrating flexible resources to cope with variations in generation and demand owing to failures or disturbances caused by deviations during the dispatch of the operating schedule. [1]. Different alternatives have been presented in the literature to increase operational flexibility, including distributed generation (DG), demand response (DR), energy storage, smart grids, and regional integration [2]\u2013[5].\nAccording to [6], non-generation resources are viewed as non-conventional sources of energy used to diversify power market services, such as stability, flexibility, and reliability of the energy supply. DR and energy storage are non-generation techniques and programs developed to support intermittent\nrenewable energy integration and efficiently manage the grid [7].\nIntermittent variable generation contributes to the fulfillment of the goals assumed by the countries for climate change while simultaneously lowering energy prices. These characteristics are desirable for advancing the energy transition processes. However, they pose a significant challenge for island countries such as the Dominican Republic because of the high reserves needed to compensate for their variability and ensure stable and secure electrical operation. Therefore, it is necessary to combine resources to take advantage of the variable renewable generation. In this research, the provision of operational flexibility services based on demand response is applied to the Dominican electricity market.\nIn the literature, proposals for methodologies based on DR with different perspectives have been verified. Among these studies: In [8], a methodology based on demand management is formulated tominimize the daily cost of electricity and consumer dissatisfaction. The results show that cost savings are between 6% and 12% without modifying consumer habits. In addition, if consumers modify their consumption habits, it can reach 50%.\nThe study in [9] proposes a strategy model to maximize the social welfare of an aggregator. Themethodology is based on on-demand flexibility and q-learning techniques, and the model determines that DR trading is more stable in the daily market based on the relationship between price and elasticity of demand, marginal cost, time, and profit constraints. Their results were verified by employing simulations of residential user consumption.\nIn [10], it was established that a contract-based approach guarantees consumers\u2019 rights and obligations. The contract provides an efficient framework for applying DR, obtaining results similar to real-time dynamic pricing. This scheme was proposed as a retail tariff design for price-responsive elastic demand in a smart grid. On the other hand, [11] provides DR resources through aggregators buying and selling in the wholesale market. This study analyzed a business model that combines aggregator participation, forecasting, bidding, and settlement processes. It also gathers information from similar models in order to understand their evolution and challenges. The work presented in [12] demonstrates that the demand from large consumers can create operating reserves, reduce the cost of energy supply, and influence the scheduling of intermittent renewable energy production. The results of this modelling allow the analysis of the behavior of the type of consumer, reserve limits, and effects of wind energy uncertainty. Another methodological approach to demand-side flexibility was presented in [13], indicating the competitive conditions necessary to mitigate the market power of generating agents when demand shifts strategically. This study analyzes a case study that demonstrates the benefits of reducing market power when the flexibility to shift demand in available locations increases when network congestion occurs. Finally, [14] implemented a methodology based on the interaction between the system operator and\nVOLUME 10, 2022 44363\ncompeting aggregators to provide DR services and maximize their revenues through rewards. The model corresponds to a non-cooperative game supported by the Nash equilibrium approach, in which the operator increases its profit by up to 7%.\nThe authors in [15] indicate that a marginal increase in the demand response implies growth in the penetration level of renewables. This study proves that demand response allows the replacement of thermal generators\u2019 high variable production costs with price-taking renewable generators.\nThe thesis correlating the increase in variable renewable energies with the reduction in prices in the wholesale electricity market was studied in [16], [17]. In [18], wholesale electricity markets in the United States were studied, highlighting the trend of an average reduction of $ 0.37 MWh when the penetration level of variable renewable energies increased by 1%.\nThis study highlights the opportunities presented by the electricity market in the Dominican Republic to gain operational flexibility during the operation of the electricity system, based on the possibilities of its regulation. The main contributions are as follows: (i) The partial displacement of demand from peak to off-peak periods, based on the elasticity of substitution, reduces the operating cost of supply, nonserved power, and CO2 emissions. (ii) Establish an incentive scheme to benefit the participants in the DR program. (iii) A dispatch simulation tool to evaluate sensitivities during the modelling process of the optimal complementarity of demand response programs with variable renewable energy participation.\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the problem statement to support the methodology; Section III explains the methodology that integrates an incentive-based demand response program in the wholesale electricity market of the Dominican Republic, reducing the cost of supply and CO2 emissions, and defines the mathematical formulation based on four optimizationmodels: the first corresponds to an economic dispatch problem, the next one considers the elasticity of substitution to shift demand from peak to off-peak periods, and continues with the distribution of the new hourly demand and the incentive scheme for DRP participants; in the last model, the baseline is updated with the inclusion of CO2 emissions control; Section IV allows the measurements of the demand response program through reports and indicators, determines and discusses the results of the case study applied to an IEEE 14-bus power system; and finally, Section V offers conclusions related to contributions, limitations, and future work.\nII. PROBLEM STATEMENT The wholesale electricity market of the Dominican Republic resulted from the capitalization process of state companies in 2000. The main characteristics are free competition in generation and the economic principle of marginal costs. The transmission and distribution activities operate as natural monopolies, highlighting the particularity that the\ntransmission activity is managed by a single company, which simultaneously plays the role of being the system operator. The distribution activity includes the role of commercialization and is organized according to the geographic areas of the concession.\nAccording to regulatory guidelines [19], the wholesale electricity market involves the interaction of generation, transmission, distribution, commercialization companies and non-regulated users, selling, transporting, and buying electricity. This market is based on contract and spot markets. In the contract market, transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity are conducted based on freely agreed supply agreements between the parties. Economic transactions are conducted at a short-term marginal cost in the spot market.\nIn energy terms, the geographical isolation of the Dominican Republic translates into a barrier with essential economic consequences for its energy supply. Although the generation mix is concentrated in oil derivatives and coal, the country faces price volatility and availability because it is not a producer, and the investment portfolio does not direct a significant share of the generation mix towards renewable energy, which barely reaches 12%. The impossibility of establishing interconnections with Haiti, the only border country, closes development possibilities and takes advantage of economies of scale, leading to high reserve margins and dependence on expensive energy sources.\nFig. 1 is a tree of problems that summarizes the factors that affect the behavior of the Dominican Republic\u2019s electricity market, from the causal perspective that worries the population, expressed in poor quality of service and the disbursement of permanent subsidies for the electricity sector. These circumstances turn the Dominican Republic into a costly market for consumers and are not very profitable for production and the environment, motivating the exploration of alternatives derived from applying new and flexible mechanisms.\nTo achieve the 13th Climate Action Goal, the Dominican Republic must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030, compared to 2010, and increase the participation of renewable energies by 25% by 2025, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). From the perspective of the electricity sector, we propose including the participation of DRP in the wholesale electricity market as a complementary alternative.\nIII. METHODOLOGY AND FORMULATION MODEL This study evaluates the methodology proposed in [20] to implement the application of DR based on the strategy of shifting demand from one hourly block to another in the daily load curve to minimize generation supply costs and reduce CO2 emissions. The analysis considers the wholesale electricity market regulation of the Dominican Republic as a case study.\nThis study simulates an optimal direct current flowwithout ohmic losses for demonstration purposes. It analyzes the effects of operational constraints, considering the provision\n44364 VOLUME 10, 2022\nof DR to reduce non-served power, supply cost, and CO2 emissions without altering the physical generation-demand balance, and providing the incentives required by the demand to guarantee the corresponding economic and environmental signals. Environmental attributes have not been well internalized in Dominican households and industries, motivating the need to structure an attractive incentive scheme based on experiences and related works, as verified in [21].\nFig. 2 summarizes the sequence of activities that constitute the methodology. It is based on the following criteria: agent prospecting on the availability of variable renewable energy, segmentation of consumption profiles based on the elasticity of substitution, incentive-based DRP, and determination of supply costs based on economic and environmental components.\nThe modeling process focuses on consumer participation using a DRP that combines the availability of variable renewable energy and the stratification of consumption profiles. The level of flexibility for the change in the load curve was adjusted using the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. Fig. 2 shows that the methodology relies on a sequential, iterative, and multi-objective process. Initially, supply costs are minimized in a generation-network model for a baseline that excludes DRP participation. Subsequently, demand shifts are determined using the CES function by considering the marginal cost obtained at the baseline. The change in demand motivates a change in dispatch, and incentives are calculated to consolidate the demand decision in the next step. This incentive is a bounded fraction of the marginal cost obtained in the baseline and must be selected to motivate consumer participation without falling into the minimum and maximum extremes of indifference and exaggeration. Finally, the supply costs were verified under new demand conditions.\nThe effects of including the cost of CO2 emissions and their results were compared to those of the baseline.\nThe scope of the proposedmodel is expressed by amodular separation of the entire process, simplifying the optimization problem. This scheme facilitates the analysis of the results and identification or anticipation of possible difficulties.\nFor comparison purposes, Table 1 summarizes the contributions and critical concepts underlying the energy management model proposals of research that consider the common element of the constant elasticity of substitution, and other operating concepts, focusing on one of the following criteria: load-shifting profile, energy technology change, variable renewable energy, and CO2 emissions. The proposed methodology flattens the daily load curve and the load duration curve, as shown in Fig. 3. The annotations Qs and ts indicate that the demand and its period of occurrence are ordered from highest to lowest values in the load duration curve, whereas vl, sh, and pk identify the valley, shoulder, and peak zones in the consumption profiles of the load curves.\nThis adjustment results in a rescheduling of dispatch, allowing calling plants with lower variable production costs and establishing new fuel consumption conditions by technology type. The reduction of peaks, filling of valleys, and load curve flattening lead to a reduction in peak demand, prices, and congestion in the network infrastructure.\nThe optimization procedure decomposes the problem into stages and link models through recursive calculations. To meet this objective, mathematical programming in\nVOLUME 10, 2022 44365\nmodels 0 and 3 minimizes an MIP function using the CPLEX solver, model 1 minimizes, and model 2 maximizes an NLP function using a CONOPT solver. The algorithm was developed in GAMS code and tested with the following computational resources: Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.30 GHz, RAM 16.0 GB.\nModel 0 performs an economic dispatch that incorporates generation and network constraints. Model 0 represents the baseline for comparative purposes, against which the different decision variables are verified.\nModel 1 was responsible for applying the load-shifting strategy as the first stage of the DRP. In this model, the theoretical principle that supports the demand displacement in the daily load curve obeys the elasticity of substitution for wholesale electricity market agents. The distribution of hourly demand is the functionality of model 2. The second part of theDRprocess defines an incentive scheme that allows the analysis of two different demand scenarios.\nFinally, model 3 was coded from model 0, including the cost of CO2 emissions and an approach to the conditions required for their reduction, according to the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) level 1 methodology. Economic and environmental indicators evaluate the behavior of the DRP and the incentives required to motivate the participation of the demand.\nA. MODEL 0: BASELINE The optimal values of the variables inmodel 0 are given by the minimization of objective function (1), subject to the generation and market constraints of the Dominican Republic. This model corresponds to an optimal DC power flow, adapted from the work conducted by [29], [30], and was tested on a modified IEEE 14 bus.\nmin($) t\u2208g,h\u2208g,w\u2208g,b\u2208g,p\u2208g, objMOD0 = \u2211 t,p ( SUC t\u00d7yt,p+SDC t\n\u00d7 zt,p + NFC t \u00d7 ut,p + VFC t \u00d7 et,p \u00d7 dp )\n+ \u2211 w,p Cw\u00d7ew,p\u00d7dp+ \u2211 h,p Ch\u00d7 ( eh,p\u2212\u03b7h\u00d7epumph,p ) \u00d7dp+VOLL\u00d7\n\u2211 b,p nspb,p\u00d7dp\n\u2200t,w, h, b, p (1)\n44366 VOLUME 10, 2022\nSubject to:\u2211 t et,p + \u2211 w ew,p\n+ \u2211 h ( eh,p \u2212 \u03b7h\u00d7epumph,p ) \u2212\n\u2211 i flowi,j,p\n+ \u2211 j flowj,i,p + nspb,p = qBASEb,p\n\u2200t \u2208 nxb,t,p,w \u2208 nxb,w,p, h \u2208 nxb,h,p, b,\ni \u2208 nni,j,p, j \u2208 nni,j,p, p (2)\nnspb,p \u2264 qBASEb,p \u2200b, p (3) et,p \u2264 ut,p \u00d7 ADt,p \u2200t, p (4)\u2211 p yt,p \u2264 limSU t,day \u2200t, p \u2208 pday (5.a)\u2211\np yh,p \u2264 limSUh,day \u2200h, p \u2208 pday (5.b) rh,p = rh,p\u22121 \u2212 ( eh,p \u2212 \u03b7h\u00d7epumph,p ) + NCR \u2200h, p (6.a)\nrh,p = RINI \u2200h, p (1) (6.b)\nrh,p = RFIN \u2200h, p (168) (6.c) ew,p \u2264 WEFw,p \u2200w, p (7.a)\u2211 p ew,p \u2265 \u03b4 \u00d7 TLOAD \u2200w, p (7.b)\nMPFRTOTp = \u03c8 \u00d7 \u2211\nb qBASEb,p \u2200b, p (8.a)\u2211\ng\n( PMAXg \u00d7ug,p \u2212 eg,p ) \u2265 MPFRTOTp \u2200g, p (8.b)\u2211\ng\n( eg,p \u2212 PMINg \u00d7 ug,p ) \u2265 MPFRTOTp \u2200g, p (8.c)\nflowi,j,p = SB\u00d7 \u03b8i,p \u2212 \u03b8j,p\nxTX i,j \u2200i, j, p (9.a)\npTXMINi,j \u2264 flowi,j,p \u2264 pTX MAX i,j \u2200i, j, p (9.b)\n\u03b8MINb \u2264 \u03b8b,p \u2264 \u03b8 MAX b \u2200b, p (10) eg,p = PMINg \u00d7 ug,p + e \u2191MIN g,p \u2200g, p (11.a)\ne\u2191MINg,p \u2264 ( PMAXg \u2212 P MIN g ) \u00d7 ug,p \u2200g, p (11.b)\ne\u2191MINg,p \u2212 e \u2191MIN g,p\u22121 \u2264 R UP g \u2200g, p (11.c)\ne\u2191MINg,p\u22121 \u2212 e \u2191MIN g,p \u2264 R DOWN g \u2200g, p (11.d)\nug,p \u2212 ug,p\u22121 = yg,p \u2212 zg,p \u2200g, p (12.a)\nyg,p + zg,p \u2264 1 \u2200g, p (12.b)\nPMINg \u2264 eg,p \u2264 P MAX g \u2200g, p (13.a)\n0 \u2264 epumph,p \u2264 epump MAX h \u2200h, p (13.b)\nConstraint (2) refers to the energy balance. The equation considers the generation and demand of all consumers and also includes the power flows through the transmission lines and the non-served power.\nThe amount of non-served power represents a part of the demand not supplied by the system. Therefore, its value cannot exceed demand (3). The fossil generation availability declared for the operation schedule corresponds to the maximum value that the dispatch can handle (4). The stress experienced by a generation unit is influenced by the number of start-ups during the operating period with significant maintenance costs. These cycling constraints were considered for the thermoelectric and hydroelectric generation (5.a, 5.b).\nThe management of the hydroelectric reservoirs is described in (6.a, 6.b, 6.c). The wind energy penetration level is defined as the proportion of coverage of the total demand during the operation programming without exceeding the expected production in each period p (7.a, 7.b).\nThe spinning reserve provision considers the primary (MPFR) and secondary (MSFR) frequency regulation margins, as indicated in (8.a, 8.b, 8.c). The approximation of the power flow calculation on the transmission lines is given by (9.a, 9.b) and the phase angles that determine the flow conditions of the lines in (10).\nThe technical minimum power value determines the limits of the generator ramps and the available margin to increase or decrease (11.a, 11.b, 11.c, 11.d). TheON/OFF states of generator g and the conditions of continuity (coupling) in period p are given by (12.a, 12.b). The operating limits, minimum and maximum, which limit the generation and pumping dispatch, respectively, are given by (13.a, 13.b).\nB. MODEL 1: ELASTICITY OF SUBSTITUTION Thismodel considers two factors differentiated in energy consumption based on quantity and price specifications obtained in each period or block of periods [31]. This differentiation of energy makes it possible to evaluate the possibility of substitution between hourly blocks using the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. Therefore, the strategy of shifting demand from peak and shoulder periods to offpeak periods in the daily consumption curve is addressed as a requirement for proceeding with the application of the DRP.\nIn DRP applications, some models utilize the concept of price elasticity to motivate the effect of linearizing the demand curve at a specific operating point instead of considering the entire demand, creating a discontinuity in the decision-making process [32]. Unlike demand response models based on price elasticity, a model based on constant elasticity of substitution is a continuous decision-making process that allows for more flexibility.\nThe utility of the CES function (added value or available budget) is defined by two consumption factors (e.g., total demand in the peak and valley periods, total demand in the shoulder and valley periods), as verified in (14).\nU (Q1,Q2) = \u03b3 \u00b7 ( \u03b1 \u00b7 Q\u2212\u03c11 + (1\u2212 \u03b1) \u00b7 Q \u2212\u03c1 2 )\u2212 \u03d1 \u03c1 (14)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 44367\nwhere, \u03b3 = Efficiency parameter; \u03b1 = Intensity factor of goodQ1; (1\u2212 \u03b1) = Intensity factor of goodQ2; \u03d1 =Degree of scale; \u03c1 = Substitution parameter. The elasticity of substitution indicates the degree of sensitivity of the relationship between two production or utility function factors when the marginal rate (MRS) of its products or profits varies, as shown in Fig. 4. It measures the curvature of an isoquant or indifference curve and the possibility of substituting factors or goods [33].\nDisplacement was performed for each profile of the daily load curve. The method was considered in two iterations: the load was displaced from peak to valley in the first iteration. The second iteration is displaced from the shoulder to the valley. The load-shifting process looks for a flattening of the daily load curve, motivating a comparison to verify that the peak period\u2019s demand is greater than the shoulder period in the first iteration and the opposite in the second iteration. The validation of these comparisons activates the movements to the valley period; otherwise, load movement does not proceed.\nThe demand block (db) in the valley period includes hours 01 to 06, the shoulder period from 07 to 18, and 19 to 24 in the peak period. The determination of the hourly blocks is purely administrative, similar to that established in the wholesale electricity market of the Dominican Republic.\nThe available budget must support the new consumption conditions, so the scale adjustment is not modified (\u03d1 =1), motivating the following general expression (15).\nBVALdb1\u2190db2b,day = \u03b3b,day \u00d7 [ \u03b1b,day \u00d7 ( qb,day,db1,iter )\u2212\u03c1b,day + ( 1\u2212 \u03b1b,day ) \u00d7 ( qb,day,db2,iter\n)\u2212\u03c1b,day]\u2212 1\u03c1b,day \u2200b, day, iter (db1\u2190 db2) (15)\nTo estimate the nonlinear function, it is necessary to apply linearization through the logarithmic form, as in the treatment in [34], as verified in this model\u2019s constraints (16.a, 16.b). Consequently, this model\u2019s objective function will focus on\nminimizing the residual error that results from this approximation process.\nmin b\u2208B,day\u2208Nday,iter1\u2208Niter objMODini1 = \u2211 b \u2211 day ( resb,day,iter1 )2 \u2200b, day, iter1(vl \u2190 pk) (16.a)\nmin b\u2208B,day\u2208Nday,iter2\u2208Niter objMODfin1 = \u2211 b \u2211 day ( resb,day,iter2 )2 \u2200b, day, iter2(vl \u2190 sh) (16.b)\nSubject to: ln ( BVALvl\u2190pkb,day ) \u2212ln ( \u03b3b,day ) + [ 1\n\u03c1b,day \u00d7ln\n{ \u03b1b,day\u00d7 ( qb,day,vl,iter0 )\u2212\u03c1b,day + ( 1\u2212 \u03b1b,day ) \u00d7 ( qb,day,pk,iter0\n)\u2212\u03c1b,day}] = resb,day,iter0 \u2200b, day, iter0(vl \u2190 pk) (17.a)\nln ( BVALvl\u2190shb,day ) \u2212ln ( \u03b3b,day ) + [ 1\n\u03c1b,day \u00d7ln\n{ \u03b1b,day\u00d7 ( qb,day,vl,iter1 )\u2212\u03c1b,day + ( 1\u2212 \u03b1b,day ) \u00d7 ( qb,day,sh,iter1\n)\u2212\u03c1b,day}] = resb,day,iter1 \u2200b, day, iter1 (vl \u2190 sh) (17.b)\u2211\ndb Vb,day,db= \u2211 p ( CMgb,day,p\u00d7qBASEb,day,p ) \u2200b, day, p, iter1 : db (pk, vl) ,\niter2 : db (sh, vl) (17.c)\nqMINb,day,db,iter \u2264 qb,day,db,iter\n\u2264 qMAXb,day,db,iter \u2200b, day, db, iter (18) BVALvl\u2190pkb,day = \u2211\ndb Vb,day,db\n\u2200b, day, db (vl, pk) (19.a) BVALvl\u2190shb,day = \u2211\ndb Vb,day,db\n\u2200b, day, db (vl, sh) (19.b)\u2211 db qDRb,day,db \u2212 6\u2211 hr=1 qBASEb,day,hr\n\u2212 24\u2211 hr=19 qBASEb,day,hr = 0\n\u2200b, day, db (vl, pk) , hr(1\u2212 6, 19\u2212 24) (20.a)\u2211 db qDRb,day,db \u2212 6\u2211 hr=1 qBASEb,day,hr\n\u2212 18\u2211 hr=7 qBASEb,day,hr = 0\n\u2200b, day, db (vl, sh) , hr(1\u2212 6, 7\u2212 18) (20.b)\n44368 VOLUME 10, 2022\nThe constraints in Eqs. (17.a) and (17.b) shift a fraction of the demand, determined from the elasticity of the substitution parameter, from peak to valley and shoulder to valley time blocks, according to the typified demand shift configuration. The cost assumed as the budget results from valuing the demand at the marginal cost obtained in the Model 0 reference, as verified in (17.c). This criterion for determining the budget is conservative. The combined effect of the increase in renewables and load shifting from peak periods motivates a reduction effect on the marginal energy costs, leading to possible surpluses to cover the billing amount.\nThe limits in the demand blocks contribute to the flattening effect of the load curve, supporting the adjustment of hourly distribution (18). The costs associated with the partial shifting of demand blocks do not involve additional expenses to the amounts initially considered in the budget because the CES function is not scaled (19.a, 19.b). To ensure that the demand blocks conform to the criteria of elasticity of substitution of the CES function and the demand response program strategy, the model proceeds to the equality specification that adds the demand blocks before and after the shifting load (20.a, 20.b).\nC. MODEL 2: DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAM The demand response is characterized by a load displacement subject to the limit and ramp management criteria. The load profile on each bus was verified in advance to determine whether to shift. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a measure of the substitution parameter that serves as an incentive to motivate user decisions, as explained in [7]. The benefit to consumers participating in the demand response program is calculated from the marginal cost proportion obtained in the baseline generation dispatch. Additionally, the probability of occurrence was provided to study the methodology in terms of uncertainty [35]. The objective function defines the incentive scheme (21).\nmax($) \u03c9\u2208 ,b\u2208B,day\u2208Nday,hr\u2208H objMOD2\n= \u2211 \u03c9 \u03c0\u03c9 \u00d7  B\u2211 b Nday\u2211 day ( 24\u2211 hr=7 { \u03bbINCb,day,\u03c9,hr\n\u00d7 ( qBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2212 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr )} +\n06\u2211 hr=1 { \u03bbINCb,day,\u03c9,hr\n\u00d7 ( qBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2212 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr )})] \u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr (21)\nSubject to:\u2211 \u03c9 \u03c0\u03c9 = 1 \u2200\u03c9 (22.a)\n\u03c0\u03c9 > 0 \u2200\u03c9 (22.b) qBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2264 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2264 qREF MAX b,\u03c9\n\u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr \u2264 6 (23.a)\nqREFMINb,\u03c9 \u2264 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2264 qBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr\n\u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr > 6 (23.b)\nif PCb,day,\u03c9,hr = 0, then\u03bbINCb,day,\u03c9,hr = 0, else\u03bbINCb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2264 \u03b6\u03c9 \u00d7 \u03bbBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr (24.a)\n\u03bbINCb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2265 0 \u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr (24.b) 6\u2211\nhr=1\nqDRb,day,\u03c9,hr = qb,day,vl,iter2\n\u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr (1to6) , db (vl) , iter2 (25.a) 18\u2211\nhr=7\nqDRb,day,\u03c9,hr = qb,day,sh,iter2\n\u2200, day, \u03c9, hr (7to18) , db (sh) , iter2 (25.b) 24\u2211\nhr=19\nqDRb,day,\u03c9,hr = qb,day,pk,iter2\n\u2200, day, \u03c9, hr (19\u2212 24) , db (pk) , iter2 (25.c) qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2212 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr\u22121 \u2264 Q up b \u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr (26.a)\nqDRb,day,\u03c9,hr\u22121 \u2212 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2264 Q down b\n\u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr (26.b)\nThe constraints in Eqs. (22.a), and (22.b) incorporated stochastic treatment to define the two demand scenarios. In (23.a) and (23.b), the hourly demand limits are defined based on the baseline demand and the minimum and maximum allowed in the modeling. The constraints in Eqs. (24.a) and (24.b) show that the incentive value is established as a proportion of the baseline marginal cost of DRP participation. In (25.a), (25.b), and (25.c), the new hourly demand is distributed, considering the growth and reduction rates, as ramps bounded in (26.a) and (26.b).\nD. MODEL 3: GENERATION-NETWORK WITH CO2 EMISSIONS CONTROL This stage has a comparative purpose with the baseline. In addition to the components used in Model 0, this stage included restrictions to reduce CO2 emissions.

In this case, the energy production is converted to a gross equivalent by applying a factor to the net production of generator g.\nThe CO2 equivalent contributions of other greenhouse gases such as CH4 and N2O were considered. The emission factors listed in Table 2 were selected from Ref. [36].\nThe fuel emission factor must be multiplied by its global warming potential (GWP) to convert to CO2eq in a period base of 100 years [37]. CO2eq emissions are shown in (28.b). According to the IPCC level 1 methodology, the quantification of CO2eq emissions was determined from expression (28.c). The CO2eq emissions were estimated to range from (28.d), and the variationswere verified at (28.e). Expression (28.f) was used to calculate the emissions avoided by variable renewable energies, and (28.g) performed the same calculations as the baseline. The change in emissions avoided\nby the participation of variable renewables was determined in (28.h).\nIV. MEASUREMENTS, RESULTS, AND DISCUSSION A. MEASUREMENTS A consumer\u2019s decision to participate in the DRP adds a benefit incentive, calculated as a function of the load size. The consumers\u2019 net benefit is determined from the variations in the marginal cost and demand for each hour, day, and bus, as illustrated in Fig. 5.\nThe performance indicators related to demand and used in this work are the net profit for participants in the DRP in (29), net profit for non-participants in the DRP in (30), percentage variations in electricity load during peak hour block in (31.a), percentage variations in electricity load during the off-peak hour block (31.b), and percentage ratio of non-served power concerning baseline consumption in (31.c).\npDRb,\u03c9\n= \u2211 day \u2211 hr [( qBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr\u2212qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr ) \u00d7fPCb,day,\u03c9,hr\n\u00d7 \u03bbBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr + ( \u03bbBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr\u2212\u03bbDRb,day,\u03c9,hr ) \u00d7 \u03d1 \u00d7 fPCb,day,\u03c9,hr \u00d7 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr\n] +  (\u2211 day \u2211 hr fPCb,day,\u03c9,hr \u00d7 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr ) (\u2211\nb \u2211 day \u2211 hr fPCb,day,\u03c9,hr \u00d7 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr\n) \n\u00d7 objMOD2 \u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr (29)\n44370 VOLUME 10, 2022\nnpDRb,\u03c9\n= \u2211 day \u2211 hr [( \u03bbBASEb,day,\u03c9,hr \u2212 \u03bbDRb,day,\u03c9,hr ) \u00d7 (1\u2212 \u03d1)\n\u00d7 fNCb,day,\u03c9,hr \u00d7 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr ]\n\u2212\n (\u2211 day \u2211 hr fPCb,day,\u03c9,hr \u00d7 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr ) (\u2211\nb \u2211 day \u2211 hr fPCb,day,\u03c9,hr \u00d7 qDRb,day,\u03c9,hr\n) \n\u00d7 objMOD2 \u2200b, day, \u03c9, hr (30)\n1LOADpkb\n=\n\u2211 p ( qBASEb,p \u2212 qDRb,p,\u03c9 )\u2211 p qBASEb,p \u00d7 100 \u2200 b, p (1to6) , \u03c9 (31.a)\n1LOADoffpkb\n=\n[\u2211 6<p\u226418 ( qBASEb,p \u2212 qDRb,p,\u03c9 )\u2211 p qBASEb,p\n+\n\u2211 19<p\u226424 ( qDRb,p,\u03c9 \u2212 qBASEb,p )\u2211 p qBASEb,p ] \u00d7 100 \u2200 b, p (7to24) , \u03c9 (31.b)\nrNSPb\n= \u2211 p nspb,p\u2211\np qBASEb,p \u00d7100 \u2200 b, p (31.c)\nThe case study analyzes the methodology applied to the operation schedule for one week in the Dominican Republic. The network was scaled using a modified IEEE standardized network of 14 buses; the inputs, configurations, and topologies are specified in the Appendix.\nIn operational and economic terms, generation dispatch must be carried out at minimum cost and safely, motivating the modeling to provide reserve margins for the frequency regulation service. Under the methodological proposal, a new DR service is incorporated, based on the partial displacement of the load from peak and shoulder periods to valley periods in the load curve, and taking advantage of the availability of the variable renewable resource.\nA simplified model based on the optimal power flow in direct current (OPF-DC) was used for the assumptions considered when applying this methodology. Although reactive power occupies a part of the transmission lines\u2019 capacity, its magnitude is much smaller than active power. This argument simplifies the optimization model; therefore, it is assumed that there are no voltage problems in the system buses.\nThe results of the model 0 runs represent the baseline. Model 1 then determines the load transfers that can be made between the hourly blocks of the load curve as a function of the elasticity of substitution and cost constraints. According to the DRP incentive scheme, model 2 solves the hourly distribution of the new demand, and model 3 incorporates the environmental component, leading to the final results and discussion.\nB. MODEL 0 RESULTS The system operator was optimized to minimize the supply cost during the coordination process. This model shows a generation dispatch that requires 86% fossil fuel and 14% renewable participation. The generation of the dispatch schedule is illustrated in Fig. 6. A change in the availability of coal generators operating at the minimum technical value between P16 and P44 was simulated. In addition, one daily start-up was configured for the thermal plants and two for the hydro plants.\nThe absence of a hydrothermal model in the Dominican Republic\u2019s electricity market does not make it possible to incorporate opportunity costs. However, this exercise has considered its declaration, considering that the regulations allow it and provide a signal of prioritization for other water uses, such as drinking water and irrigation of crops, which require maintaining certain reservoir levels. Therefore, the hydroelectric generation reached 1.84% of the total generation. Additionally, pumping activity is included to take advantage of periods of low prices and, in other cases, to create conditions of balance between generation and demand, representing 68.8% of hydroelectric participation. On the other hand, wind generation prioritizes dispatch because it is a price-taker.\nThe variability in the local marginal price between a maximum price of $100/MWh and a minimum price of $37.6/MWh is observed, as shown in Fig. 7.\nFig. 8 shows the balance between generation and demand. In this coverage, it is observed that 2.8% of the load represents\nVOLUME 10, 2022 44371\nnon-served power owing to the limitations inherent to the transmission lines.\nC. MODEL 1 RESULTS The sensitivity of the CES function can be appreciated with the test values of the substitution parameters 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5, and their corresponding constant elasticities of 0.33, 0.50, and 0.66, in the objective of the partial shift of demand from peak and shoulder periods to valley periods in the daily load curve.\nThe elasticity of substitution shows a saturated sensitivity, with no significant shifts from peak to valley, contrary to what was observed from the shoulder to the valley. In Fig. 9, the mean of the relative demand variations reaches 0.10% during the peak periods, whereas in Fig. 10, the mean is 16.5% during the shoulder periods.\nD. MODEL 2 RESULTS The decision to assume variability characterized by the elasticity of substitution is conditioned by an incentive scheme that allows the hourly distribution of demand. For this simulation, the shifted demandwith substitution parameter 2.0was considered. A DRP incentive amounting to $103,124.09 has\nalso been determined. The apportionment of this amount was based on the DRP share.\nA sample of demand scenarios 1 and 2 presents the corresponding results for bus 4 on Sunday and bus 10 on Monday, as shown in Figures 11 and 12, which shift the load from shoulder to valley and peak to valley, respectively. The hourly distribution of the demand scenarios (1 and 2) depends on the incentive scheme, probability of occurrence (75%,25%), and lower and upper limits of variation that were set (> 10%|). In Fig. 11, the two optimal scenarios show a shift of 49 MWh in energy consumption for a relative reduction of 15.6% in the demand block corresponding to the shoulder periods. In contrast, in Fig. 12, 5.1 MWh is reduced for a relative change of 4.5% in energy consumption in the demand block of the peak periods, motivating an additional load in the valley periods.\nE. MODEL 3 RESULTS Initially, the baseline electricity supply operating cost was verified by considering the mandatory participation of the variable renewables. Without the renewable cap constraint, the objective function reaches $1,019,294.25. When the\n44372 VOLUME 10, 2022\nconstraint was included in the model to ensure a minimum penetration between 11% and 12%, the cost increased to $1,020,204.92. The same exercise was performed considering demand response scenario 1 for each substitution parameter analyzed and was used to verify the effect on the CO2 emissions limit, as shown in Table 3.\nRegarding the base case, the scenarios corresponding to a limit of renewables participation do not present a significant variation in the objective function because the reductions are less than 0.4%. However, the effect of incorporating CO2 constraints motivates changes in demand response. The simulation shows increments between 15.8 and 16.2% when the price is $10 per ton of CO2. Observing that the substitution parameters caused moderate changes in the objective function, other results were analyzed by selecting a substitution parameter equal to 2.\nTables 4 and 5 analyze the generation and demand indicators after applying the methodology to the two demand shift scenarios. In each case, comparisons were made with the objective function in the baseline for an initial variable renewable energy penetration of 12% (similar to the maximum allowable in the baseline) and another of 17%, corresponding to the maximum allowed with the demand response program. The results verify that the increase in renewables reduces the operating cost of generation dispatch, similar to the results observed by [39]. The simulations consider the mitigation of CO2 emissions, causing the objective function to be higher than the corresponding baseline function, with relative variations ranging from 7.27% to 16.03%, and a reduction of tons of CO2 equivalent, from 2.77 to 28.02. If the CO2 emissions cost is reduced to zero, renewables can increase by 5%. This reduction in CO2 cost translates into a supply cost of -8.4%, compared to the baseline.\nIt is also observed that the incentive allowed all the participants in the DRP to be compensated favorably. The loads connected to buses 3 and 4 are incentivized in periods when demand is used and discouraged in periods that do not participate. The results include all consumers, the incentive scheme, benefits of price and quantity reduction, and the losses due to the increases according to the corresponding hourly block. These balances were defined according to the participation criteria. They represent only profits or losses, motivating the need to configure a regulatory scheme.\nAnother aspect to consider is the relative variation in the load produced by the elasticity of substitution, from 0.1% to 10.49% in the peak and shoulder blocks, and from 0.94% to 42.13% in the valley block. In the case of non-served power, buses 2 and 5 show critical relative increases, in the worst-case scenario, the non-served power reaches variations of 15.38% and 15.12%, respectively, and 4.78% and 5.69%, respectively, in the best case. Despite this behavior of the nonserved power per bus, there is a notable reduction of 19.1% compared to the baseline.\nF. DISCUSSION"

After applying the load shift, the new period was 125: the 5th hour of the sixth day. It should be noted that the maximum demand at baseline corresponds to a shoulder hour. However, based on a reduced selection that considers different load profiles, depending on the type of end-user, accurate information is registered by the operator of the wholesale electricity market in the Dominican Republic. The results show a reduction in the non-served power of 19.1% when the renewable energy penetration level increases by 5%.\nThe change in the time of occurrence of maximum demand to a period not considered within the administrative hours defined for the peak period occurs with 93.5% of the users in the DRP. This result should not be taken lightly, even though the actual calculation process is handled with the accumulated horizon of the entire year, because it may result in differences between a real off-peakmaximum demand, which is more significant than the one considered on-peak from the perspective of the regulation of the wholesale electricity market in the Dominican Republic. This regulatory condition is vulnerable because the valley, shoulder, and peak periods are defined administratively and not based on scarcity.

In this regard, it should be noted that the Dominican Republic does not have large flows or reservoirs, which reduces the possibility of developing largescale hydroelectric projects. Therefore, investment initiatives consider their feasibility by considering additional solutions to energy production, such as the supply of drinking water for consumption, irrigation canals for agriculture, and flood prevention in vulnerable areas. This variety of uses implies the establishment of priorities and justifies the rationality of defining the opportunity cost of water."

The financial situation of electricity distribution companies could be more critical if the regulatory authority of the electricity sector does not limit the maximum price of energy purchases in the wholesale electricity market. However, this regulatory policy affects the net social benefits of the other market agents, and the economic prospective of the state, considering the dependence on gross domestic product and energy consumption, as verified in [41].\nThe net income balance of distribution companies does not exhibit linear behavior due to various factors, such as market price caps, poor collection management, and technical and non-technical losses. The state can establish efficient controls in its internal processes to implement a staggered goal that allows the reduction of the subsidy that complements the distribution tariff and thus redirects its focus towards the poorest sectors of society. Therefore, this methodology can be\nused to design a policy of gradual dismantling of the subsidy by verifying that in the simulation of the case study, it was possible to achieve a reduction of 30.45% in the average marginal energy costs used for the valuation of distribution companies\u2019 consumption in the wholesale electricity market."

            "heading": "8) IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED",
            "text": "The results obtained reveal the consistency of the methodology in the objective of minimizing the operating cost of generation supply, without exceeding the limits established for non-served power and CO2 emissions, allowing the increase of variable renewables and the economic compensation of the participants in the DRP. In the electricity business, functionalities that contribute to the numerical accuracy of the results are always welcome for decision making. Therefore, the following improvements have been identified to add value in the continuity of this research: i) automatic segmentation of demand based on clustering criteria that consider electrical, economic and technological characteristics; ii) advanced calculation of CO2 emissions based on IPCC levels 2 and 3; iii) inclusion of a variable renewables forecasting module, based on variables supported by the meteorological service; and iv) consideration of transmission losses, due to their relevance in the determination of non-served power.\nV. CONCLUSION This study presents a market methodology designed to integrate and evaluate a demand response program in the wholesale electricity market in the Dominican Republic. The optimization problem is structured in four stages: an economic dispatch of the generation that defines the operating cost of supply, the load displacement from the CES function, the distribution of hourly demand based on an incentive scheme, and a new dispatch that incorporates the control of CO2 emissions.\nThe simulation of the case study showed favorable results in taking advantage of the availability of the variable renewable resource, allowing a 5% increase in penetration compared to the baseline, a 30.5% reduction in the average marginal energy costs, an 8.4% reduction in the operating cost of supply, and a 19.1% reduction in non-served power. In addition, it was possible to verify the favorable results of the incentives that benefit the participants in the DRP. This last contribution can be linked to a regulatory policy that mitigates deviations in generation availability and declared demand for operational scheduling.\nThe application of this methodology has limitations when the demand blocks saturate the sensitivity of the CES function because the effect of load shifting is minimal or does not occur, as evidenced in the iterations from peak to valley of the case study, where variations of less than 5% of the base demand are verified despite having limits that allow it. Regarding the incentive scheme, establishing the upper limit that defines its variability during the optimization process should be considered. High incentives may distort the nature of the regulation mechanism and low values may not\nVOLUME 10, 2022 44375\nbe attractive, considering that some participants in the DRP would not have benefits. Another aspect that contributes to reliable results is the quality of the wind-resource forecasting service.\nThe indicated limitations should be considered for future research on this topic. Thus, the methodology can be improved by forecasting variable renewables, exploring model-based criteria for demand segmentation, and losses in transmission activity to reduce deviations during operations. Another aspect to consider in future research is the treatment of the demand disutility function, considering that this is the main barrier for the demand side to exercise flexibility. If not adequately examined, assessing the benefits of demand flexibility may be overly optimistic. The addition of these functionalities would be beneficial for strengthening the consistency and validity of the results. In addition, the\noptimization model can be adapted to determine the behavior of CO2 emissions at levels 2 and 3 of the methodology developed by the IPCC, allowing their differences with related studies and the sense of application in the electricity sector\nVOLUME 10, 2022 44379\nof the Dominican Republic) to support the energy transition processes.\nAPPENDIX A. VARIABLES, PARAMETERS, AND SCALARS Table 6 shows the variables (v), parameters (par), and scalars (s) used in the modellingmodelling methodology.\nThe description of the concept, unit, type of variable, and stage of the model where they are used are indicated in detail.\nB. GENERAL SETTINGS ABOUT CONNECTION POINTS This model solves a cost-based economic dispatch problem by considering the elasticity of substitution as a strategy of the DRP to shift the load from peak to shoulder and valley periods to adjust the daily curve of demand profiles. The DPR effect includes the participation of various renewable\n44380 VOLUME 10, 2022\nenergy sources. The transmission network in the modified IEEE14-bus system, including five different generation technologies, is shown in Fig. 15.\nThe network topology and transmission capacity were modeled by considering the connection of the generators and the demands in Table 7. The parameters of the lines and transformation elements are presented in Table 8.\nC. GENERATION SPECIFICATIONS Five power plants represent the generation mix, according to the combustion or renewable resources used: coal, fuel, gas, hydraulics with reservoir and pumping characteristics, and a variable renewable source represented by wind power, as detailed in Table 7.\nAccording to the statistics published by [38] in its 2019 annual report, the generation mix composition has the distribution shown in Fig. 16. The exact percentage of each generation technology is assigned to approximate the case study of the electricity system of the Dominican Republic. The remaining parameters were hypothetical and were intended to test the modelling proposed in the methodology. The current variable fuel costs of production (VFC) corresponding to the weekly schedule were used to construct\nproduction cost curves. The details of these generation specifications are listed in Tables 9 and 10.\nD. TEST REGISTERS In Tables 11\u201313, the scalars, parameters, and boundaries required to determine the variability conditions are considered in the optimization process to test the functionality of the model.\nE. LOAD PROFILES Demand was selected from the real consumption of commercial measurement systems in the wholesale electricity market of the Dominican Republic. Fig. 17 shows the profiles of the load per bus.\nThe consumption magnitude was scaled by 35% for its adaptation in the generation-network model of Models 0 and 3. This alteration reduces the magnitude but preserves load variability. Additionally, consumption has been diversified to study the behavior of residential, industrial, and commercial users [42]. The magnitude of this type of load offers great functional possibilities for a new demandresponse service.\nWhen verifying the load curve of consumers, which includes users with typical residential, commercial, and\nVOLUME 10, 2022 44381\nindustrial profiles, the arithmetic means of the valley, shoulder, and peak periods are compared to determine the partial load-shifting actions for each day and on each bus, depending on the statistic of the highest magnitude. This task was preprocessed outside the model and entered as an input parameter. The input data are presented in Table 14.\nNote: The number indicates the shifting action, according to the scheduling criteria of the operation. In this case, 0 represents no action, 1 shifts the load from peak to valley periods, and 2 from shoulder to valley periods.\nF. AVAILABILITY OF DECLARED WIND ENERGY The records provided by the forecasting service to the system operator were considered, as shown in Fig. 18, to preserve the same variability behavior in the model without degrading the error metrics of the production estimate of the wind power, which for the baseline represents a penetration of 12% of the total demand in the coordination horizon.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to acknowledge Organismo Coordinador del Sistema El\u00e9ctrico Nacional Interconectado (OC).
