In the literature, various new particles and/or fields have been introduced to explain the astrophysical and experimental data, and their presence, in principle, may also enhance the W -boson mass. In this study, we investigate axion-like particle (ALP), dark photon (DP), and chameleon dark energy (DE) models for a solution to the W -boson mass excess. We find that the ALP and DP interpretations have been significantly narrowed down by global electroweak fits. The possibility of attributing the W\u2212boson mass anomaly to the chameleon DE is ruled out by other experiments.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWith the discovery of the Higgs particles, the standard model (SM) [1\u20134] has achieved unprecedented success and interpreted almost all the phenomena measured by the colliders. However, astrophysical data, raises questions in the community. The observations of the galaxy rotation curves [5], gravitational lensing [6], and cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum [7] have demonstrated that the total mass of the universe cannot be accounted for by the ordinary matter in the SM, and dark matter (DM) has been introduced to explain the missing mass [8\u201311]. The data of Ia supernova [12], baryon acoustic oscillations [13], large-scale structure [14], and CMB call for the presence of dark energy (DE) that makes up 68% of the total energy density of the current universe [15]. Though extensively explored, the nature of DM and DE is still essentially unknown. Various new particles or fields have been introduced in the literature [16\u201323]. Some of these particles or fields are also well theoretically motivated. For instance, axion, a hypothetical sub-eV particle beyond SM and a promising candidates for cold DM, has been initially introduced to solve the CP violation in strong interaction [24, 25].\nNotably, some anomalies have been reported in some physical experiments over the past few years. For example, in 2021, the muon anomalous magnetic moment was measured by E989 at Fermilab with a relative precision of 368 parts-per-billion. The combination with a previ-\n\u2217zulei@pmo.ac.cn \u2020fenglei@pmo.ac.cn \u2021yzfan@pmo.ac.cn\nous measurement from Brookhaven National Laboratory yielded a deviation from the SM prediction at a confidence level (CL) of 4.2\u03c3 [26]. The electroweak fit, including Z-pole data and mtop and mh measurements, yields a well-determined mass mW,SM = 80.361\u00b1 0.006 GeV of the W -boson that mediates the electroweak interactions. Hence, the precision measurement of the W -boson mass is essential in probing the SM\u2019s internal consistency. Recently, the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) Collaboration reported a precise measurement of W -boson mass [27], which is mW = 80.4335 \u00b1 0.0094GeV. The deviation from the SM prediction is approximately \u223c 7\u03c3 [27]. This remarkable discovery is the focus of this study. The W -boson mass equals to gv/2 at the tree level, where v= 245 GeV is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and g denotes the weak-isospin coupling parameter. Like other particles in the SM, its mass also suffers from loop corrections. New particles/fields interacting with W -boson also have loop corrections to its mass. This fact motivates us to examine whether some DM/DE models could explain the latest CDF W -boson measurement. Accordingly, in this study, we investigate a few models, including the models of the axion-like particle (ALP), dark photon (DP) and the chameleon DE. We find out that the first two scenarios are still viable, whereas the last one is not. All models can enhance the loop corrections of the W -boson mass, but some parameters have already been ruled out by other experimental/astrophysical data. Although, the ALP and DP (with mZ\u2032 O(EW )) models are still viable, we have identified some favored regions without violating other constraints. ar X iv :2 20 4. 04 18 3v 3 [ he pph\n] 3\nO ct\n2 02\n2"

            "text": "The W -boson mass can be measured at a hadron collider through the charged current Drell-Yan process, i.e, pp\u0304 \u2192 W\u00b1 + X \u2192 l\u00b1 + \u03bd(\u03bd\u0304) + X. There are three observables in this process: the lepton-pair transverse mass, missing transverse momentum, and charged lepton transverse momentum. The measurement accuracy of the W - boson mass has improved rapidly with the growing experimental data and advancements in detection technology. Previously, the W -boson mass was measured to a precision of 19 MeV at ATLAS [28], 23 MeV at CMS [29], 59 MeV at LHCb [30], 33 MeV at the Large ElectronPositron (LEP) collider [31], and 16 MeV at the Tevatron [32] by averaging the measurements of CDF [33] and D0 [34]. The global fit result of the electroweak experiments available in 2018 is 7 MeV [35], which is 58% of the 2021 PDG average of direct measurements [36].\nThe precision electroweak measurements in colliders involve fermions scattering each other. In these inelastic scattering processes, the new gauge bosons can be ex-\nchanged by fermions and induce an oblique correction, which would shift the SM coupling [37\u201339]. When this correction dominates, we may use the freedom from new physics, particles/fields, to perform field redefinitions and put all new physics effects into the vacuum polarization [40, 41].\nFor new physical models, the loop contribution to the W -boson mass can be described in terms of the oblique parameters of (S, T , U) [40, 41], i.e.,\nm2W = m 2 W,SM +\n\u03b1c2Wm 2 Z\nc2W \u2212 s2W\n[ \u2212S\n2 + c2WT + c2W \u2212 s2W 4s2W\nU ] ,\n(1) where sW \u2261 sin\u03b8W, cW \u2261 cos\u03b8W, and \u03b8W denotes the Weinberg mixing angle. \u03b1 and mZ are the fine structure constant and Z-boson mass, respectively. The SMpredicted W -boson mass is mW,SM = 80.361\u00b1 0.006GeV [36]. In addition, the complete electroweak precision measurements are parameterized by S, T ,U that are given by [40, 41].\nThe global electroweak fit is a robust tool to explore the correlations among observables in the SM and predict the direction of new physics. Because the electroweak parameters in the SM are closely related to each other, we can expect that some observables in the global electroweak fits may suffer from new tensions once the mW is changed [45\u201347]. Two groups [42, 43], replacing 80.379 \u00b1 0.012 GeV (PDF2021) with 80.4335 \u00b1 0.0094\nGeV (CDF2022), have reported the oblique parameters, and Ref. [42] used the very recent measurement of the top quark mass by the CMS Collaboration [44], the results are presented in Table I. We could find that these parameters are far more different from the old S, T , U values from PDG [36] via a comparison between the new physics and experiments through the \u03c72 calculation based on S, T ,U is [47]:\n\u03c72 = ( \u2206S \u2206T \u2206U ) \u03c32s Cst\u03c3s\u03c3t Csu\u03c3s\u03c3uCst\u03c3s\u03c3t \u03c32t Ctu\u03c3t\u03c3u\nCsu\u03c3s\u03c3u Ctu\u03c3t\u03c3u \u03c3 2 u\n  \u2206S\u2206T\n\u2206U\n , (2)\nwhere (\u03c3s, \u03c3t, \u03c3u) are the errorbars, \u2206A = Amodel\u2212A0, and A denotes S, T ,U . We could obtain the allowed parameter regions by \u2206\u03c72 \u2261 \u03c72\u2212\u03c72min, and \u03c72 is dependent on the parameters in different new physical models.\nBelow we discuss three specific models and set the constraints.\n3"

The difference between ALP and axion models is that both mass and coupling are free parameters for the former. The effective interactions of ALP and electroweak gauge bosons, considered in this study, are given by the following dimension-5 effective Lagrangian [57\u201360]\nLD\u22645eff = 1\n2 (\u2202\u00b5a) (\u2202\n\u00b5a)\u2212 m 2 a\n2 a2 + g2CWW\na \u039b WA\u00b5\u03bdW\u0303 \u00b5\u03bd,A\n+ g\u20322CBB a\n\u039b B\u00b5\u03bdB\u0303\n\u00b5\u03bd ,\n(3) where WA\u00b5\u03bd and B\u00b5\u03bd denote the gauge field strengths of SU(2)L and U(1)Y , respectively, and g and g \u2032 denote the corresponding coupling constants, respectively. B\u0303\u00b5\u03bd and W\u0303\u00b5\u03bd are their duals defined as B\u0303\u00b5\u03bd = 12 \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2B\u03b1\u03b2 (with\n0123 = 1). The \u039b \u223c 1TeV is the energy scale of new physics. The ALP field and its mass are denoted by a and Ma, respectively. The interactions between ALP gauge bosons are contributed by the last two terms of Eq. (3). In addition, the dimensionless couplings C\u03b3\u03b3 = CWW + CBB describe the coupling strength of the interactions between ALP and photon in leading order.\nBecause we only consider the ALP much lighter than the electroweak scale, where the effect from the ALP mass can be neglected, the corrections to electroweak precision observables can not be directly described by the oblique parameters S, T and U in principle. In Ref. [57] the oblique parameters are equivalently given in terms of \u03c1\u2217, sW , s0 and s\u2217 by calculating the vacuum polarization function to one loop order (please see Subsection 6.3 therein for more details):\ns2\u2217 = g\u20322\ng2 + g\u20322 \u2212 swcw\n\u03a0\u03b3Z ( m2Z )\nm2Z\n\u03c1\u2217 =1 + \u03a0WW (0) m2W \u2212 \u03a0ZZ(0) m2Z \u2212 2sw cw \u03a0\u03b3Z(0) m2Z\ns2W = g\u20322\ng2 + g\u20322 \u2212 c2w\n[ \u03a0WW ( m2W ) m2W \u2212 \u03a0ZZ ( m2Z ) m2Z ]\ns20 = g\u20322\ng2 + g\u20322 +\ns2wc 2 w\nc2w \u2212 s2w\n[ \u03a0\u03b3\u03b3 ( m2Z )\nm2Z +\n\u03a0WW (0)\nm2W\n]\n\u2212 s 2 wc 2 w c2w \u2212 s2w \u03a0ZZ\n( m2Z )\nm2Z\n(4)\nwhere the vacuum-polarization functions are defined by the decomposition \u03a0\u00b5\u03bdAB(q) = \u03a0AB ( q2 ) g\u00b5\u03bd+O (q\u00b5q\u03bd), and the correction terms in the lowest-order expressions are s2w = g \u20322/ ( g2 + g\u20322 ) and c2w = g 2/ ( g2 + g\u20322 ) . Although the S, T ,U parameters are actually derived for\n.\nthe particles with a mass larger than the electroweak energy scale, we have checked at least for the mass of W - boson, which is enhanced by the ALP\u2019s loop diagrams, that the form of the oblique parameters is correct. Thus we adopt these expressions in our analysis.\nWith the \u03c72 defined in Eq.(2), we obtain the allowed parameter spaces of Wilson coefficients in Fig. 1. The best-fitting results are summarized in Table. II. The results are shown in Fig. 1, where the two red(blue) regions are favored by Case A (Case B) of CDF II. Our results with the previous 2021 PDG data are very similar to the results in [57], indicating that our method is sufficiently enough. Compared with the 2021 PDG results (i.e., the regions in grey), the viable regions are significantly narrowed down. Owing to such a paramount improvement, the current regions are stringently constrained by the CAST experiment [57] for ma < O(keV) with C\u03b3\u03b3/\u039b < O(10\u22127)TeV\u22121 (i.e., the black line shown in Fig. 1). Thus only a fine-tuning parameter space for C\u03b3\u03b3 \u223c 0 is allowed. In other words, the interpretation of the W -boson mass excess with ALP is just marginally acceptable (i.e., it has been excluded at a significance level above 2\u03c3). Fortunately, for ma \u223c GeV, we have a much weaker constraint of C\u03b3\u03b3/\u039b < O(1)TeV\u22121 (shown in light orange). The corresponding permitted region overlaps with the\u223c 2\u03c3 counters, suggesting that such massive ALP accounts for the correct W -boson mass without violating current observational constraints. Notably, the parameter regions with ma \u223c GeV and C\u03b3\u03b3/\u039b \u223c TeV\u22121 can also explain the muon magnetic moment anomaly [57]. After analyzing the global electroweak fit result, we conclude that the new result of CDF has significantly narrowed down the allowed parameter regions of the ALP model."

In addition, sin\u03b1 and \u03ba correspond to kinetic mixing with photon and mass mixing with Zboson, respectively. The physical eigenbasis can be obtained by diagonalizing the mass terms from U(1)\u2032 breaking and SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) breaking. The nondiagonal mass terms give a mixing between Z \u2032 and Z, thereby affecting the precision of electroweak measurements and the coupling with neutrinos [62, 63, 69]. In the end, one mass eigenstate is massless (the photon A\u00b5), whereas the other two (denoted as Z1 and Z2) receive masses (we assume mZ1 < mZ2 , where Z1 is the Z-boson in the SM, and Z2 represents the dark Z \u2032). In terms of (B\u00b5,W 3 \u00b5 , Z \u2032 \u00b5), or alternatively (A\u0302\u00b5, Z\u0302\u00b5, Z\u0302 \u2032 \u00b5), the physical mass eigenstate shows:\n10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 100 101 tan( ) 10 3\n2 \u00d7 10 3\n3 \u00d7 10 3\n4 \u00d7 10 3\n6 \u00d7 10 3 PDG2021 Blas, et al Lu, et al\n(7) we can replace the mixing parameters sin\u03b1 and \u03ba with \u03be and tan\u03b1. Furthermore, the Z \u2212 Z \u2032 contribution to S, T , U (the leading order) could be expressed conveniently, which has been calculated in Ref. [61]. The DP enhances mW via kinetic mixing and mass mixing in our work.\nIn this work, we consider both the possible kinetic mixing and mass mixing terms. We choose two independent\n5 parameters, \u03b1 and \u03be, with a mass of Z \u2032 larger than 1 TeV. A stringent bound on the new vector boson has been set through the coupling with the SM leptons gZ\u2032 l\u0304l. The constraints are from 10\u22124 (mZ\u2032 \u223c GeV) to 0.1 (mZ\u2032 \u223c TeV) [71, 72]. Thus, we only consider the case mZ\u2032 \u2265 1TeV to avoid the constraints from the collider in our work.\nWith the above information and the new range S, T , U resulting in the global electroweak fit [43], we employ Eq.(2) to calculate the favored regions and bestfitting results in the scenarios of Cases A and B (see the red contour lines and blue contours), and obtain \u03be \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 (see Fig. 2 and Table.

Clearly, similar to Fig.1, the inclusion of the CDF II W -boson has significantly tightened the constraints, which is, in particular, the case of \u03be, although the ranges of tan(\u03b1) \u2264 0.2 are comparable with the previous ones. In the future, supposing the parameters of \u03be and tan(\u03b1) have been independently constrained by other experiments or astrophysical data, the interpretation of the W -boson mass excess with DP will be further tested."

            "text": "DE has been one of the most mysterious topics in modern cosmology since the discovery of the cosmic acceleration of the present universe [12, 73\u201379]. The prevailing dynamical model is to introduce a scalar field rolling\nalong a flat potential so that negative pressure can be achieved. However, such a scalar field is beyond the SM and suffers from several conceptual issues, such as the equivalence principle [80]. One of the methods to release this tension is the so-called chameleon mechanism, which involves a scalar field with mass depending on the local matter density [81\u201385]. Models involving these fields can give rise to acceleration naturally at late times in the universe, and remain consistent with local constraints. Such models have attracted considerable attention, as the requirement that the scalar field can vary with the local density of matter means that coupling to the SM states is compulsory. Therefore, in the early universe, chameleon fields are constrained by precision measurements, such as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the redshift of recombination. As the universe cools down, the background chameleon fields remain fixed in the minimum potential, with a slow drift in location. This induces a variation in the mass of any species of particles, that can couple with chameleon fields. These couplings imply that there may exist an interesting collider phenomenology.\nPrecision electroweak measurements are screened from the indirect effect of DE, making such corrections effectively unobservable at present colliders, and limiting the DE discovery potential at CDF. In this study, we shall choose to work with a theory of the broken phase of the electroweak force, in which the photon and the massive vector bosons could interact with chameleon scalar \u03c6 according to the action [86]\nS = \u22121 4\n\u222b d4x{2F(\u03c6) ( \u2202aW+b \u2212 \u2202bW+a ) ( \u2202aW \u2212 b \u2212 \u2202bW \u2212 a ) + 4m2WJ (\u03c6)W+aW\u2212a\n+ F(\u03c6) ( \u2202aZb \u2212 \u2202bZa ) (\u2202aZb \u2212 \u2202bZa) + 2m2ZJ (\u03c6)ZaZa\n+F(\u03c6) ( \u2202aAb \u2212 \u2202bAa ) (\u2202aAb \u2212 \u2202bAa) } ,\n(8)\nwhere W\u00b1a and Za denote the gauge fields associated with the W\u00b1 and Z, respectively, and Aa denotes the gauge field associated with the photon. In addition, we introduce two functions F(\u03c6) and J (\u03c6), which describe how the chameleon scalar \u03c6 couples to the gauge boson kinetic and mass terms, namely,\nF(\u03c6) = exp(\u03b2\u03b3 \u03c6\nMPl ), J (\u03c6) = exp(\u03b2m\n\u03c6\nMPl ), (9)\nwhere \u03b2\u03b3 and \u03b2m denote the dimensionless chameleon couplings to photon and matter, respectively, and MPl denotes the reduced Planck mass. The matter coupling \u03b2m is assumed to be universal to all species of matter, and the chameleon scalar is much smaller than the electroweak scale. The chameleon scalar \u03c6 can also enhance mW via loop diagrams, and its contributions are reflected in the self-energy correction.\nIn Ref. [86] the forms of S, T , U , were expressed in\nthe terms of \u03b2m and \u03b2\u03b3 (please see Subsection 4.2 therein for the details). With the new ranges of S, T , U found in the recent global electroweak fit [43], now we can constrain the distribution of \u03b2m and \u03b2\u03b3 with Eq.(2). The resulting favorable parameter space is presented in Fig. 3, it is almost linear (see the red ribbon region).\nNotably, the parameters of the chameleon DE can be independently constrained by various methods; in this study, we show some classic constraints. The torsion pendulum tests of the presence of new scalar forces yield a lower bound on the matter coupling \u03b2m [87]. The CAST experiment excludes large parameter regions by searching for solar chameleon at the soft X-ray energy range [88]. Neutron interferometry [90] and atominterferometry techniques [92, 93] yield upper limits, and provide a very strong bound.

Thus, it is interesting to examine whether these widely-investigated scenarios are in tension with the new S, T , and U parameters found in the global electroweak fit including the CDF II W -boson mass measurement. For this purpose, we\ninvestigate three models involving either very light particles or scalar fields in this work, including the ALP, DP (dark Z \u2032), and chameleon DE models. Different from the relatively loose constraints on CBB and CWW with the 2021 PDG data, now the favored regions are separated and narrowly distributed. The interpretation of the CDF II mW measurement with the ALP model is found to be just marginally consistent with the CAST constraint (see Fig.1) except for Ma \u223c 1 GeV. Anyhow, the favored regions, though narrowly distributed, overlap with those inferred from the previous global electroweak fit (see Fig. 1). Therefore, the CDF II W -mass measurement has played a significant role in narrowing down the parameter space of the ALP model, but the model is still viable. For the DP model, the latest global electroweak fit results yield a \u03be \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 and tan(\u03b1) \u2264 0.2 (see Fig.2) for mZ\u2032 O(EW ). In the future, if independent constraints on these two parameters are yielded in other experimental/astrophysical data, this possibility can be further tested.\nFor the chameleon DE model, we find an almost linear parameter region for the mW excess (see Fig. 3). However, such a region has been convincingly excluded by the CAST, KWISP, and neutron interferometry experiments. In this study, we address the possible new light particle as the origin of the W -boson mass excess, and certainly there are many other interesting possibilities. For instance, it is argued that the inert two Higgs doublet model can naturally handle the CDF II W-boson mass without violating other experimental/astrophysical constraints, and the preferred DM mass is between 54 and 74 GeV [95]. In light of these facts, we conclude that the CDF II W -boson mass measurement can initiate a new window for the new physics, and significant progress is expected in the near future."
