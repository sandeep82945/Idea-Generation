    "abstractText": "The use of the synthetic drugs has increased in the last few decades; however, these drugs exhibit various side effects. Scientists are therefore seeking alternatives from natural sources. Commiphora gileadensis has long been used to treat various disorders. It is commonly known as bisham or balm of Makkah. This plant contains various phytochemicals, including polyphenols and flavonoids, with biological potential. We found that steam-distilled essential oil of C. gileadensis exhibited higher antioxidant activity (IC50, 22.2 \u03bcg/mL) than ascorbic acid (IC50, 1.25 \u03bcg/mL). The major constituents (>2%) in the essential oil were \u03b2-myrcene, nonane, verticiol, \u03b2-phellandrene, \u03b2-cadinene, terpinen-4-ol, \u03b2-eudesmol, \u03b1-pinene, cis-\u03b2-copaene and verticillol, which might be responsible for the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The extract of C. gileadensis exhibited inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase (IC50, 450.1 \u03bcg/mL), xanthine oxidase (251.2 \u03bcg/mL) and protein denaturation (110.5 \u03bcg/mL) compared to standard treatments, making it a viable treatment from a natural plant source. LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of phenolic compounds such as caffeic acid phenyl ester, hesperetin, hesperidin, chrysin and transient amounts of catechin, gallic acid, rutin and caffeic acid. The chemical constituents of this plant can be explored further to investigate its wide variety of therapeutic potential.",

Scientists are therefore looking for alternatives from natural sources. Since time immemorial the traditional medicine practitioners have been using the mixture of herbs or mixture of plant extracts to treat various disorders [1]. Commiphora gileadensis is one such plant. It has been used for centuries to treat various disorders [2,3]. In Arab countries, C. gileadensis is traditionally known as balm of Makkah, basin and bisham [4]. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, in which there are around 190 species that belong to the genus Commiphora distributed in regions such as southern Arabia (Yemen and Oman); in northeastern African countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan; and in subcontinental countries such as India and Pakistan [5\u20137]. Its resin is widely used in perfumes and, due to its medicinal properties, it is used in medicinal products to treat various disorders including arthritis, obesity, pain, and gastrointestinal and parasitic infections [7,8]. It is found in the Sarawat mountains in the west of Saudi Arabia. One study used an aqueous extract of C. gileadensis as an analgesic, diuretic and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2321. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28052321 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nantihypertensive agent [9]. In another study, an aqueous extract induced anti-inflammatory effects in rats [10,11]. However, few authors have examined the antibacterial activity of the aqueous extract [12\u201314]. In this paper, we report on the chemical constituents and biological activities of an extract of C. gileadensis, which include antioxidant activity, the inhibition of protein denaturation and xanthine oxidase activity from the aerial parts of the plant."

            "text": "3.1. Biological Activity 3.1.1. Antioxidant Activity\nAntioxidants protect cells from the adverse effect of foreign molecules, drugs, carcinogenic substances and free radicals [18]. Antioxidants can reduce free radicals by scavenging it. Free radicals are generated in various metabolic processes and are associated with a\nnumber of stress-related diseases including cancer, diabetes, dementia and necrosis of the myocardial cells due to interaction with DNA, which causes causing mutation [18\u201320]. Extract of C. gileadensis showed antioxidant activity due to the presence of various chemical constituents such as polyphenols, flavonoids, catalase and oxidase. Therefore, plant-based products or mixtures that include polyphenols and flavonoids possess antioxidants that can eliminate free radicals and protect human health and wellbeing [21]. In the present study, antioxidant activity was analyzed using DPPH. Free radical scavenging activity was also evaluated using DPPH, and it was found that the ethanolic extract and essential oil showed potent antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 56.5 \u00b1 0.4 and 22.2 \u00b1 0.5, respectively, compared to ascorbic acid (1.25 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5g/mL) which is a known antioxidant molecule. The presence of compounds such as \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, \u03b3-terpinene and terpinen-4-ol may have contributed to the antioxidant activity observed [22]. Ethanolic acid was also evaluated for inhibition using a \u03b2-carotene bleaching assay. The ethanolic extract showed appreciable activity with an IC50 value of 75.8 \u00b1 7.7 \u00b5g/mL compared to rutin (4.50 \u00b1 0.35 \u00b5g/mL). This might be due to the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, hesperidin and other compounds present in ethanolic extract and the aerial parts of the tree. The phenolic compounds and flavonoids (gallic acid, caffeic acid and rutin) present in the ethanolic extract inhibit the denaturation of protein. The results are presented in the Table 5. The aqueous extracts of C. gileadensis leaf and twig have been shown to be successful in treating alloxan-induced diabetes in hypercholesterolemic male rats, where they restored all biochemical parameters to normal [23].\nTable 5.

COX-1 Inhibitory Activity\nEvaluation of COX activity is the basic strategy for developing NSAIDs to treat inflammation-related disorders. To test the COX-1 inhibitory effect of the ethanolic extract, a COX-1 inhibitory screening assay was performed using commercial assay kits (ab204698, Abcam, Tokyo, Japan) containing SC560 as a standard. The assay was performed as per the instruction provided with the kit. Different concentrations of ethanolic extract in 5% DMSO were used, with 5% DMSO used as a control. The preliminary screening results indicated that the ethanolic extract of C. gileadensis displayed COX-1 inhibitory activity at a concentration of 450 \u00b5g/mL. Under comparable conditions, the IC50 of the standard compound SC560 was 5 ng/mL. It is possible that the CAPE, caffeic acid, gallic acid and other phenolic compounds are responsible for COX-1 inhibitory activity. More investigations would be required to evaluate COX-inhibitory activity on the fractionated ethanolic extract. Furthermore, NSAIDs\u2019 primary mode of action prior to Vane\u2019s discovery [24] of their inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase is the suppression of protein denaturation [25]. Ben-Yehoshua et al. [26] have reviewed the COX-2 inhibitory activity of chloroform extract of C. gileadensis.\n3.1.3. Xanthine Oxidase Activity\nOne of main characteristics of the ischemic injury is the overproduction of superoxide anion and the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase, which produces superoxide anions when xanthine is converted to uric acid [27]. Some natural products containing polyphenols have shown a dose-dependent inhibitory effect [28]. The flavonoids and phenolic acids present in plant products are potent inhibitors of enzymes such as cyclooxygenase, xanthine oxidase and lipo-oxygenase [29]. These enzymes control inflammation, hyperuricemia and gout. The chemical constituents gallic acid, rutin, caffeic acid and CAPE play important roles in the inhibition of xanthine oxidase. Inhibitors of xanthine oxidase and uricosuric agents are used in the treatment of diseases such as gouty arthritis and inflammatory diseases. At present, drugs such as allopurinol are used in the treatment of gout, but these synthetic drugs have various side effects [30]. Drugs with greater therapeutic values and lesser side effects are required. As the ethanolic extract of C. gileadensis contains flavonoids and phenolic compounds like rutin, apigenin, catechin, hesperetin, hesperidin, CAPE and caffeic acid, the xanthine oxidase activity of its ethanolic extract was investigated. A literature survey on xanthine oxidase activity revealed no publications on the inhibitory activity of C. gileadensis in the treatment of xanthine oxidase and gout. The oil extracted from the aerial part of the plant exhibited significant xanthine oxidase activity. Inhibitory activity data is expressed as inhibitory concentration (\u00b5g/mL, Table 5). Wang et al. [31] reported that the caffeic acid, its derivatives and other flavonoids can inhibit xanthine oxidase."

[33], measuring antioxidant activity involves establishing the amount of antioxidant needed to decrease the initial DPPH concentration to 50% (IC50). A DPPH stock solution (0.002 percent w/v) in ethanol was prepared. As a serial dilution process, various ethanoic concentrations of the extract or essential oil (4\u2013500 \u00b5g/mL) were prepared. DPPH solution (150 \u00b5L) was mixed in an ELISA plate with 150 \u00b5L of the sample at various concentrations. ELISA plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min until the\ncolor developed. Using a multi-mode ELISA reader (Synergy HTX, Biotek, CA, USA) the developed color was measured at 517 nm. DPPH radical scavenging activity was determined and the IC50 was calculated using SigmaPlot ver. 11 [34].\n% Free radical Scavenging activity = [Abs.control \u2212 Abs.sample]\nAbs.control \u00d7 100 (1)\n4.5.2. \u03b2-Carotene Bleaching (BCB) Assay\nA solution of \u03b2-carotene/linolenic acid was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of \u03b2-carotene as a stock solution into 100 mL of chloroform. In another flask, linolenic acid (25 mg) and Tween 20 (215 mg) were mixed and 3 mL of \u03b2-carotene solution was then added. The chloroform was evaporated by flushing with nitrogen gas. Next 75 ml of distilled water was added to the \u03b2-carotene/linolenic acid solution. Immediately after preparation, the absorbance of this solution was recorded at 470 and 700 nm. A standard antioxidant (rutin) solution was prepared by dissolving 3 mg of rutin in 10 mL methanol (300 \u00b5g/mL) as stock, and then various concentrations of rutin were prepared (0.6\u201319 \u00b5g/mL). Different strength solutions of extract (15\u2013500 \u00b5g/mL) were prepared in methanol in an ELISA plate; 275 \u00b5L of \u03b2-carotene/linolenic acid solution was added to all the cells, each of which contained 25 \u00b5L of extract, methanol and rutin standard. All the solutions (control and test) were incubated (50 \u25e6C) for 1 h. The absorbance was taken at 470 nm and 700 nm at zero time, then after 1 h and 2 h. The control sample contained the equivalent amount of methanol. The degradation rate and antioxidant activity were calculated using the formula:\nDegradation rate of \u03b2-carotene = Ln (A initial/A Sample)/60 (2)\nAntioxidant activity (100%) = Degradation rate of control \u2212 degradation rate of sample\ndegradation rate of sample \u00d7 100 (3)"
