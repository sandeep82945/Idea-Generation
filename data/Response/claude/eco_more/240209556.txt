 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Empirically test the game theoretic model proposed in the paper using real-world data on traffic violations and police enforcement strategies. This could involve collecting data on speeding rates, traffic citations, police patrols etc. and analyzing how they relate to each other over time. 

2. Extend the model to account for imperfect information. The paper assumes perfect information but drivers likely have uncertainty about police enforcement strategies. Modeling this could lead to new insights.

3. Incorporate additional player types beyond just police and drivers. For example, policymakers who set speed limits and penalties, or technology companies developing speed monitoring systems. This could reveal new strategic interactions. 

4. Evaluate the impact of deterrence more rigorously. The paper mentions deterrence effects but does not model them fully. Building in deterrence factors explicitly could alter equilibrium strategies.

5. Consider asymmetric players, where some drivers are more prone to speeding than others. The model currently treats all drivers homogenously. Allowing for heterogeneity could reveal new dynamics and optimal enforcement policies.
