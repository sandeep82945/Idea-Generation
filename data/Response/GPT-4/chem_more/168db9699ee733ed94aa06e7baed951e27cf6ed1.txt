Role of Membrane Lipid Diversity in Epithelial Polarity: Investigate how variations in the composition and distribution of membrane lipids, beyond phosphoinositides (PIs), glycosphingolipids (GSLs), and phosphatidylserine (PS), contribute to the establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity. This research could explore the functional roles of less-studied lipids and their interactions with protein complexes in polarity establishment.

Mechanisms of PI Species Localization and Function: Conduct detailed studies to unravel the mechanisms that govern the specific localization of different phosphoinositide species (e.g., PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(4,5)P2) and their enzymatic converters within cellular membranes during polarity formation. This research would aim to clarify the role of these lipids in membrane identity and the spatial-temporal regulation of epithelial cell polarization.

Interplay Between Lipid Rafts and Epithelial Polarity: Investigate the role of lipid rafts, enriched in GSLs and cholesterol, in the segregation of membrane domains and the organization of polarity complexes. This study would aim to elucidate how lipid rafts contribute to the formation of the apical membrane and the maintenance of apical-basolateral polarity, focusing on their interaction with specific proteins and signaling pathways.

Cross-talk Between Lipids and Cytoskeletal Dynamics in Polarity: Explore how membrane lipids, particularly phosphoinositides, influence cytoskeletal dynamics and the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton during epithelial morphogenesis. This research would delve into the mechanisms by which lipids regulate actin filament assembly, microtubule organization, and the role of the cytoskeleton in vesicular trafficking to and from membrane domains.

Comparative Studies of Polarity Across Different Epithelia and Organisms: Conduct comparative studies to examine the similarities and differences in the mechanisms of polarity establishment and maintenance across various epithelial tissues and model organisms. This research could provide insights into the evolutionary conservation of polarity mechanisms and identify unique lipid-protein interactions specific to certain tissues or species.
