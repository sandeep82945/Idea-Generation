    "abstractText": "A series of novel 3D coordination polymers [Ln2(Qdca)3(H2O)x]\u00b7yH2O (x = 3 or 4, y = 0\u20134) assembled from selected lanthanide ions (Ln(III) = Nd, Eu, Tb, and Er) and a non-explored quinoline2,4-dicarboxylate building block (Qdca2\u2212 = C11H5NO4) were prepared under hydrothermal conditions at temperatures of 100, 120, and 150 \u25e6C. Generally, an increase in synthesis temperature resulted in structural transformations and the formation of more hydrated compounds. The metal complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction methods, thermal analysis (TG-DSC), ATR/FTIR, UV/Vis, and luminescence spectroscopy. The structural variety of three-dimensional coordination polymers can be ascribed to the temperature effect, which enforces the diversity of quinoline-2,4-dicarboxylate ligand denticity and conformation. The Qdca2\u2212 ligand only behaves as a bridging or bridging\u2013chelating building block binding two to five metal centers with seven different coordination modes arising mainly from different carboxylate group coordination types. The presence of water molecules in the structures of complexes is crucial for their stability. The removal of both coordinated and non-coordinated water molecules leads to the disintegration and combustion of metal\u2013organic frameworks to the appropriate lanthanide oxides. The luminescence features of complexes, quantum yield, and luminescent lifetimes were measured and analyzed. Only the Eu complexes show emission in the VIS region, whereas Nd and Er complexes emit in the NIR range. The luminescence properties of complexes were correlated with the crystal structures of the investigated complexes.",

            "text": "Lanthanide complexes have been gaining more and more interest due to the possibility of creating various structures with good magnetic, luminescent, surface, catalytic, and thermal properties. These complexes can find many applications in different fields such as sorbents, storage materials, catalysts, sensors, optoelectronics, and medicine materials. Due to the high coordination number of lanthanide(III) ions and the nature of the ligands used in syntheses, they can create various discrete structures or coordination polymers (CPs) with different dimensionality and porosity (metal\u2013organic frameworks, MOFs). The appropriate selection of metal ions and organic ligands allows the construction of optimized structures\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28176360 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 2 of 26\nwith further application possibilities [1\u20137]. The structural diversity of the coordination polymers also arises from specific conditions of the applied traditional solvothermal and non-solvothermal synthesis strategies. The influence of obvious factors such as temperature, pH, solvent, and synthesis time on the final architecture of the CP is widely known, but not easily explained [8\u201311]. The hydro/solvothermal methods widely used for the synthesis of CPs are characterized as highly efficient methods and allow obtaining compounds with a high degree of crystallinity. Predicting the crystal structure, and designing and controlling the CP topology is possible thanks to the detailed selection of hydro/solvothermal synthesis parameters [12]. The advantage of these hydro/solvothermal methods is the possibility of controlling the synthesis temperature (usually in the range of 100\u2013200 \u25e6C), which is a very important factor in obtaining high-quality crystals. The synthesis temperature is also one of the key parameters influencing the structure and properties of CPs/MOFs; however, its impact is not completely recognized. In some reports, the authors claimed that the increase in temperature causes an increase in the dimensionality and coordination number of metal ions while the number of the coordinated solvent molecules decreased. Another group of researchers reported that the crystallinity of the metal complexes increases as the synthesis temperature decreases. Their results revealed that the density and dimensionality of CPs/MOFs increase with increasing temperature [12\u201314]. The impact of temperature on the crystal structures of metal complexes is reflected in the coordination environments of metal centers, as well as coordination modes of ligands [15\u201322]. In hydro/solvothermal synthesis, the temperature change causes the formation of different autogenous pressure, which influences the crystallization process of the synthesized products, depending on the characteristics of the substrates used. It is well known that N-heterocyclic polycarboxylic acids are excellent candidates for the formation of metal complexes due to their different coordination modes. Yet, the properties of quinoline-2,4-dicarboxylic acid as a multidentate N,O-donor ligand are not really well recognized in the construction of discrete metal complexes and coordination polymers. To best of our knowledge, only a few examples of crystal structures of metal complexes are known that contain analogous of quinoline-2,4-dicarboxylic acid [23\u201325]. Most of the reported complexes were built up from transition metals and N-donor auxiliary ligands such as 1,10-phenanthroline; 4,4\u2019-bipyridine, or 2,2\u2019-bipyridine [25\u201332]. The main aim of this contribution to the topic highlighted above was to determine the impact of temperature effect on the self-assembly coordination polymers constructed from selected lanthanide(III) ions (Ln = Nd, Eu, Tb, Er) and quinoline-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2Qdca) as a non-explored organic bridging\u2013chelating building block. The second goal of our investigation was to study the luminescence properties of the obtained compounds due to their further application as active luminescent components in polymeric hybrid materials. Lanthanide coordination entities are attractive because of their interesting physicochemical features and numerous applications as so-called new materials. The reason for this is that the luminescence of the lanthanides is unique with their sharp emission bands and higher lifetimes of the excited states [33\u201337] in the visible (Sm, Eu, and Tb) and NIR region (Pr, Nd, Ho, Er, and Yb) [38\u201340]. In particular, the luminescence of lanthanides in the NIR range is very attractive because of their potential applications in the medical field as luminescent probes, in telecommunication, and in photonic devices such as light-emitting diodes [34\u201337,41\u201344]. As a result of our work, four groups of isostructural 3D coordination polymers were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions at different temperatures (100 \u25e6C, 120 \u25e6C. and 150 \u25e6C). Single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction methods were applied for structural investigations of the obtained lanthanide complexes. Crystal structures and diverse conformation and coordination modes of the quinoline-2,4-dicarboxylate linker were analyzed in detail, along with a discussion on crystal-to-crystal transformations. Thermal (TG-DSC) and spectroscopic (ATR-FTIR, UV/Vis, and luminescence spectroscopy) characterizations of the investigated lanthanide complexes are presented in detail below.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 3 of 26"

            "text": "The best diffraction data were obtained for crystals selected from samples 1, 4, 8, 9, and 13 (Table 2), while, for the description of crystal structures representing the distinguished series (I\u2013IV) of isostructural coordination polymers, the crystal structures of 1 (type I), 8 (type II), 4 (type III), and 13 (type IV) were selected.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 5 of 26\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 6 of 26\nThe neodymium(III) coordination polymer [Nd2(Qdca)3(H2O)3] (sample 1) formed at 100 \u25e6C, as the only representative of type I, crystallized in the orthorhombic Pna21 space group. The structure of the complex is displayed in Figure 2, while the selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Tables S2, S7 and S12. The asymmetric unit contained two neodymium(III) ions, three quinoline-2,4-dicarboxylate ligands, and three coordinated water molecules (Figure 2a). The complex had the form of a three-dimensional coordination polymer with two crystallographically independent central atoms. Both neodymium atoms were eight-coordinated. The coordination of Nd1 atom occurred through six carboxylate oxygen atoms from five Qdca2\u2212 anions, one oxygen atom from the aqua ligand, and one nitrogen atom from the Qdca2\u2212 anion. The coordination sphere of the Nd2 atom consisted of five carboxylate oxygen atoms from five Qdca2\u2212 anions, two oxygen aqua ligands, and one nitrogen atom (Figure 2b). The Nd\u2013Ocarb bond distances were in the range 2.355(5)\u20132.581(5) \u00c5. The Nd\u2013Ow bond distances ranged from 2.433(5) to 2.449(6) \u00c5, while the Nd\u2013N bond lengths varied in the range of 2.664(4)\u20132.888(4) \u00c5 (Table S2). The remaining bond lengths and angles in quionoline-2,4-dicarboxylate ligands were within their normal ranges (Tables S2 and S7). Three different coordination modes and conformations of Qdca2\u2212 anion could be distinguished in the structure of [Nd2(Qdca)3(H2O)3] (Figure 2c) (Tables S12, S22 and S23). The molecule A-Qdca acted as a pentadentate bridging\u2013chelating ligand with both bidentatebridging (\u00b52-\u03b71:\u03b71) carboxylate groups. The adjacent carboxylate oxygen atom O1A, along with the nitrogen atom of A-Qdca ligand, chelated the Nd1 atom to form a five-membered ring. The non-planar syn\u2013anti carboxylate group in position 2 was only slightly rotated from the plane of the quinoline ring, as indicated by the value of the dihedral angle equals to 12.9\u25e6 (throughout the work, reference was made to the dihedral angle between the carboxylate group and the pyridine plane of the quinoline). The non-planar anti\u2013anti carboxylate group at position 4 was almost perpendicular to the plane of an almost plane quinoline ring, as shown by 88.37\u25e6. The B-Qdca ligand behaved as tetradentate ligand coordinating four neodymium atoms through both bidentate-bridging carboxylate groups (\u00b52-\u03b71:\u03b71). The COO group in position 2 was rotated from plane of the quinoline ring by 6.11\u25e6, while rotation of the second carboxylate group was greater, being 62.61\u25e6. The carboxylate group in position 2 coordinated Nd atoms in a non-planar syn\u2013syn mode, while the COO group in position 4 had non-planar anti\u2013anti mode. The C-Qdca ligand could be regarded as tetradentate bridging\u2013chelating agent binding two neodymium atoms. The carboxylate group in position 2 showed a monodentate mode and, along with the nitrogen quinoline atom, chelated the neodymium atom into the five-membered ring. This group was rotated by 6.96\u25e6 from the quinoline ring. In comparison to the remaining Qdca2\u2212 anion, the carboxylate group in position 4 was only rotated by 24.96\u25e6 from the plane of the heterocyclic ring. The compound [Nd2(Qdca)3(H2O)3] had the form of a three-dimensional coordination polymer. Its crystal packing viewed along the a axis (Figure 2d) showed characteristic structural motifs. The Nd1 atoms were connected through single carboxylate bridges from A-Qdca ligands into the linear chains extended in the c direction. Moreover, Nd2 atoms were linked by single carboxylate bridges but from B-Qdca linkers into the linear chain in the c direction (Figure 2d). The single neighboring chains of Nd1 and Nd2 centers were further interconnected in the a direction by double carboxylate bridges from A-Qdca and B-Qdca linkers forming an eight-membered wavy ring, as can be seen in packing view of the compound along the c axis (Figure 2e). Among these structural motifs, there were free spaces in which coordinated water molecules were located. The shortest (5.409(5) \u00c5) distance between Nd atoms appeared when two carboxylate groups bridged the atoms. When neodymium atoms were joined by a single carboxylate group from A-Qdca (B-Qdca) linker, the Nd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Nd1 and Nd2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Nd2 distances were 6.672(5) \u00c5. The longest distances 10.037(5) \u00c5 among Nd atoms were observed when metal centers were connected by the C-Qdca ligand. As can be seen in Figure 2d, inorganic\u2013 organic layers were connected via the A-Qdca ligand. The adjacent A-Qdca ligands were\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 7 of 26\nlocated in the c direction in a head\u2013tail fashion, forming stacks along the c axis. The intermolecular distances C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C in the stacks suggested the existence of \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions between aromatic parts of the ligands.

Such a type (II) of coordination polymer was formed as the only phase for Tb(III)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 8 of 26\nions and the second phase in the case of the coordination polymers of Nd(III) and Eu(III) ions formed at 100 \u25e6C. Additionally, this type of coordination polymer was observed for Nd(III) ions at 120 \u25e6C and Eu(III) at 150 \u25e6C. The coordination polymer of europium(III) ions [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O (sample 8) is described as the representative of type II crystal structures (Figure 3). These coordination polymers crystallized in the triclinic P-1 space group. The structure of complex 8 is displayed in Figure 3, and the selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Tables S4, S5, S9, S10, S14 and S15. The asymmetric unit of the compound comprised three Qdca2\u2212 anions, two crystallographically independent metal ions, and five water molecules. The coordination environment of Eu1 atom was built up from five carboxylate oxygen atoms from five Qdca2\u2212 anions, two nitrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom from the aqua ligand. The second atom Eu2 was coordinated by four carboxylate oxygen atoms from four Qdca2\u2212 anions, one nitrogen atom, and three oxygen atoms from water molecules. In the outer coordination sphere of the metal complex appeared one water molecule (Figure 3a). The Eu\u2013Ocarb bond distances were in the range 2.280(4)\u20132.424(4) \u00c5, while the bond lengths of Eu\u2013N varied from 2.689(5) to 2.830(4) \u00c5. The Eu\u2013Ow bond lengths ranged from 2.454(4) to 2.473(5) \u00c5 (Table S4). The coordination polyhedra of eight-coordinated europium(III) atoms are given in Figure 3b. In the complex [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O, the Qdca2\u2212 anion exhibited three coordination types (Figure 3c, Tables S14, S22 and S23). The A-Qdca ligand behaved as a tetradentate bridging\u2013chelating ligand binding three different metal centers. The carboxylate group in the 2 position acted as a monodentate group, joining the europium atom with the nitrogen from the quinoline ring into the five-membered ring. The non-planar syn\u2013syn COO group in the 4 position displayed a bidentate-bridging mode (\u00b52-\u03b71:\u03b71). The carboxylate groups from positions 2 and 4 were rotated from the quinoline ring by 6.7\u25e6and 32.20\u25e6, respectively. The B-Qdca ligand functioned as a tetradentate bridging\u2013chelating ligand. In comparison to the A-Qdca ligand, carboxylate group in the 4 position deviated from the heterocyclic ring by 58.63\u25e6, showing a monodenate character, while the COO group in the 2 position exhibited a syn\u2013anti bidentate-bridging mode (\u00b52-\u03b71:\u03b71), being rotated from the quinoline ring by 10.64\u25e6. Similarly to the coordination fashion of A-Qdca, B-Qdca ligands also chelated the metal center through neighboring N and O atoms. The C-Qdca ligand showed the same coordination mode as the A-Qdca ligand but a different conformation, related to the diverse rotation of the COO group from position 4 in relation to the quinoline ring plane (39.50\u25e6) and the syn\u2013syn conformation mode of COO group. The second carboxylate group of the C-Qdca linker showed a rotation by 18.58\u25e6 from the plane of pyridine ring. In the crystal structure of the complex [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O, the characteristic motif in the form of layers composed of dimeric Eu1 units double-bridged by carboxylate groups from A-Qdca located in a head\u2013tail fashion was observed (Figure 3d). Such an arrangement in this structural motif was enforced by strong \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions between aromatic parts of the A-Qdca ligands with intermolecular distances C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C of 3.176(9) \u00c5. As can be seen from the packing view along the a axis (Figure 3e), in the structure of complex [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O, a characteristic secondary building block in the form of wavy chain could also be distinguished, containing alternatively arranged metallic centers Eu2Eu1Eu1Eu2Eu2Eu1. The same type Eu1 coordination centers were bridged by two carboxylate groups (position 4) from A-Qdca linkers with a Eu1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Eu1 distance of 5.348(4) \u00c5, while Eu2 atoms were joined by carboxylate (position 4) bridges from C-Qdca ligands with a distance of 5.426(4) \u00c5. Eu1 and Eu2 atoms were linked by a single carboxylate bridge (position 2) from the B-Qdca ligand with a distance of 5.880(4) \u00c5. These chains were connected by B-Qdca ligands into the two-dimensional inorganic\u2013organic layers extended in the bc plane direction. Further such layers were joined by A-Qdca and C-Qdca linkers into the three-dimensional metal\u2013organic framework. One-dimensional hexagonal channels occupied by free water molecules were also visible in the crystal packing when viewed along the a axis. The shape and character of such channels (Figure 3e) were defined by the coordinated water molecules making such parts of structure more polar.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 9 of 26Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 28\nFigure 3.

The Nd\u2013Ow bond lengths ranged from 2.484(6) to 2.571(7) \u00c5 (Table S3) Similarly to the above-described structures, three independent Qdca2\u2212 anions appeared in the complex [Nd2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b73H2O (Figure 4c, Tables S18, S22, and S23). The tetradentate bridging\u2013chelating A-Qdca molecule coordinated three Nd1 atoms. The syn\u2013anti COO group in position 2 exhibited a bidentate-bridging character (\u00b52-\u03b71:\u03b71), while the second COO group displayed only monodentate behavior. Additionally, this ligand chelated the Nd1 atom through neighboring N and O atoms. The carboxylate group (position 2) deviated from the plane of quinoline ring by 25.40\u25e6, while the second COO group (position 4) was rotated by 35.88\u25e6. The B-Qdca ligand showed a pentadentate bridging\u2013chelating character and coordinated four neodymium (Nd1 and Nd2) atoms. Both COO groups exhibited a bidentate-bridging coordination mode (\u00b52-\u03b71:\u03b71), while their conformations were different (syn\u2013anti and anti\u2013anti). The COO group (in 2 position) was only rotated from the quinoline ring by 8.82\u25e6, while the second COO group was significantly deviated from the quinoline plane by 61.65\u25e6. The C-Qdca ligand exhibited a three-dentate bridging\u2013chelating character with monodentate COO groups. These groups (positions 2 and 4) were rotated from the quinoline ring plane by 28.88\u25e6 and 51.93\u25e6. The packing view of the [Nd2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b73H2O structure along a axis allowed distinguishing the chain of metal centers of type Nd1Nd2Nd1Nd2 in which neighboring neodymium atoms were connected by single carboxylate bridges from parallel head-to-tail B-Qdca ligands. In the c axis direction, Nd1 atoms were joined by two carboxylate groups (from position 2) of A-Qdca ligands with a Nd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Nd1 distance of 5.669(5) \u00c5. The Nd2 atoms from neighboring chains were linked by B-Qdca ligands in the c axis direction. In addition to the connectivity among Nd atoms, the packing view along the a axis clearly revealed the presence of one-dimensional channels occupied by uncoordinated water molecules (Figure 4d). The shape of pseudo-hexagonal channels was determined by the coordination environment of six metal centers Nd1Nd2Nd2Nd1Nd2Nd2. The Nd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Nd2 distances were 6.710(5) and 6.594(5) \u00c5, while metal sites were bridged by carboxylate groups from position 4 and position 2 of the B-Qdca ligand, respectively. The Nd2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Nd2 distances were 9.014(5) \u00c5. Erbium(III) ions formed the same coordination polymer (IV type) with quinoline-2,4dicarboxylic acid at 100 and 120 \u25e6C of the formula [Er2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b74H2O (samples 13). Similarly to the above-described coordination polymers [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O and [Nd2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b73H2O, the erbium compound also crystallized in the triclinic P-1 space group. The structure of complex [Er2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b74H2O is displayed in Figure 5, and the selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Tables S6, S11 and S16. The asymmetric unit contained the same coordination components as in [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O, but four water molecules appeared in the outer coordination sphere. The crystal structure of the erbium(III) complex contained seven-coordinated Er1 and eight-coordinated Er2 metal centers (Figure 5a,b). The coordination environment of Er1 was composed of one aqua ligand, five carboxylate oxygen atoms from five Qdca2\u2212 anions, and one nitrogen atom. The coordination sphere of Er2 atoms contained three aqua ligands, four carboxylate oxygen atoms from four Qdca2\u2212 anions, and one nitrogen atom. The Er\u2013Ocarb bond distances were in the range of 2.236(3)\u20132.375(3) \u00c5 while the bond lengths of Er\u2013Ow varied from 2.291(3) to 2.384(3) \u00c5. The Er\u2013N bond lengths were 2.601(3) and 2.715(3) \u00c5 (Table S6). The structure of 13 also exhibited three types of Qdca2\u2212 anions (Figure 5c, Tables S16, S22 and S23). A-Qdca behaved as a three-dentate bridging linker coordinating Er1 atoms. Monodentate and syn\u2013syn bidentate bridging carboxylate groups at positions 2 and 4 deviated from the quinoline ring by 8.20\u25e6 and 44.51\u25e6, respectively. The B-Qdca ligand acted as a tetradentate bridging linker binding Er1 and Er2 atoms. Carboxylate groups at position 2 (syn\u2013anti) and 4 were rotated from the quinoline ring by 11.70\u25e6 and 69.12\u25e6, respectively.

All spectra were characterized by a broad band in the 3700\u20132700 cm\u22121 range originating from the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups \u03bd(OH), proving the presence of hydrogen-bonded water molecules in the structures of the obtained complexes.

Three different types of transitions can be found in electronic spectra of lanthanide trivalent ions: f\u2194d, LMCT/MLCT charge-transfer, and f\u2194f transitions [48,49]. Usually, f\u2194d and LMCT/MLCT charge-transfer transitions are not observed in electronic spectra\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 15 of 26\ndue to the fact that the f electrons are shielded by the 5s and 5p orbitals and, thus, less affected by the ligand environment [48]. For this reason, the lanthanide ions generally exhibit absorption and emission bands in visible, near-ultraviolet, and infrared, attributed to the transitions between 4f levels, and they emerge as sharp lines with high oscillator strengths (10\u22126). The electronic spectrum of quinoline-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2Qdca) exhibited intense absorptions with \u03bbmax of about 250 nm and a shoulder band of about 220 nm, as well as a second broad asymmetric absorption with a maximum of about 340 nm and two poorly separated bands in the region of 380\u2013400 nm which overlapped the visible range (Figures S9\u2013S12). All of these transitions may be described as ligand-centered \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* and n\u2013\u03c0* transitions. The absorption spectra of lanthanide complexes showed no significant differences from the spectrum of H2Qdca in the range of 200\u2013350 nm; however, the maxima of the bands exhibited a slight hypsochromic shift in comparison with free acid (Figures S9\u2013S12). Moreover, they did not show a subtle vibronic structure, potentially indicating strong \u03c0-delocalization throughout the ligand. The visible spectra of lanthanide complexes exhibited the presence of non-separated and asymmetric absorption bands with very low intensities of about 444 nm for Tb(III) complexes and 475 nm for Eu(III) complexes only. Furthermore, low absorptions with small intensities occurred in the range of 480\u2013670 nm and 530\u2013880 nm in the case of Eu(III) and Nd(III) complexes, respectively, which may have been related to the 4f electron transitions."

It was difficult to find significant differences in their thermal decomposition due to their high structural similarity. Additionally, neodymium(III) and europium(III) samples prepared at 100 \u25e6C were obtained as the mixture of two crystal phases. It was impossible to separate them; therefore, the recorded TG-DSC curves refer to the mixtures of compounds. In general, all investigated lanthanide(III) complexes were stable in air atmosphere at room temperature and then started to exhibit multi-step decomposition during heating. The first step in the temperature range of 30\u2013357 \u25e6C corresponded to the release of both coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules in the overlapping stages. Dehydration processes were accompanied by the endothermic effects observed on the DSC curves. It is worth emphasizing that the dehydrated forms of lanthanide(III) complexes were unstable. This fact suggests that the elimination of coordinated water molecules from the coordination sphere of atom centers implied the formation of unsaturated metal nodes that were most probably crucial for the decomposition process [50]. Further heating caused their decomposition and burning, accompanied by significant mass losses (about 50%) recorded on the TG curves associated with strong exothermic effects. As the solid residues of metal complex heating in air atmosphere, the corresponding metal oxides Nd2O3, Eu2O3, Tb4O7, and Er2O3 were formed above 600 \u25e6C [51\u201353]. The profiles of TG-DSC curves for neodymium samples obtained at 100 and 120 \u25e6C were very similar in spite of the fact that two crystal phases appeared at 100 \u25e6C. Their dehydration process occurred in two quite well-separated stages in the temperature ranges 30\u2013135 and 30\u2013122 \u25e6C for samples prepared at 100 and 120 \u25e6C, respectively. Next, further elimination of water molecules took place up to 357 and 345 \u25e6C with mass losses of 7.49% and 8.33%, respectively. Endothermic effects recorded at 188 and 193 \u25e6C for phases assynthesized at 100 and 120 \u25e6C corresponded to the removal of coordinated water molecules. In the case of the amorphous phase obtained at 150 \u25e6C, only a gradual mass loss of 10.54% in the temperature range 30\u2013304 \u25e6C without a visible effect on the DSC curve was recorded. At higher temperature, the decomposition of neodymium samples took place, accompanied by several exothermic effects on DSC curves. In all cases, the formation of some unstable intermediate products at about 520 \u25e6C was postulated from the profiles of TG and DSC curves. The final solid product, i.e., neodymium(III) oxide, was formed above 675 \u25e6C.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 16 of 26\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 28 took place, accompanied by several exothermic effects on DSC curves.

In the range of 30\u2013326 \u00b0C, mass losses of 3.05%, 1.67%, 2.17%, and 6.03% were observed. These steps were related to the liberation of inner and outer coordination water molecules from both types of crystal phases (II and III). The endothermic effects associated with these stages were recorded at 152 and 199 \u00b0C. Next, the decomposition of the dehydrated forms of complexes took place along with burning processes. The final product Eu2O3 was formed at 697 \u00b0C. The TG curves of europium(III) samples obtained at 120 and 150 \u00b0C, which presented the same type of crystal structure, exhibited a two-step dehydration process. The first mass loss occurred up to about 150 \u00b0C, while the second one occurred up to 295 \u00b0C. The removal of coordinated water molecules, which most probably occurred at higher temperature, was reflected by the presence of endothermic effects at 192 and 205 \u00b0C on the DSC curves. Next, the formation of europium(III) oxide was observed as the result of decomposition and burning of desolvated forms of complexes.\nThe dehydration of terbium(III) complexes as-synthesized at 100 and 120 \u00b0C occurred in two overlapping stages in the corresponding temperature ranges of 30\u2013122, 30\u2013132 \u00b0C and 123\u2013325, 133\u2013314 \u00b0C, respectively (Figure 8). Similarly to the previously described compounds, the second stage of water molecule liberation was associated with a strong endothermic effect, whereas the first step was accompanied by a weak effect.

The intensity ratio of the 5D0 \u2192 7F2 transition to 5D0 \u2192 7F1 transition of Eu(III) compounds was 6.2, 5.2, and 5.9, respectively.

This observation is in good agreement with the crystal structures of europium complexes. The same coordination polymer of the formula [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O was formed at 100 \u00b0C, whereas, at 120 and 150 \u00b0C, a mixture of [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O and [Eu2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b73H2O phases was observed. It can be postulated that the presence of a crystal phase with a greater number of outer coordination water molecules yielded a decrease in luminescence intensity. In other words, a reduction in the number of non-coordinated water molecules in the structure of europium complexes resulted in a substantial enhancement of luminescence intensity. This is in accordance with the observations made by Salaam et al. [55]. Under identical experimental conditions, no emission was observed in the case of Tb(III) complexes.\nTo elucidate the energy transfer processes in the Eu(III) complex, the triplet state energy of the Qdca2\u2212 anion was determined. The phosphorescence spectrum of [Gd2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O was measured at \u2212196 \u00b0C in ethanol. The gadolinium(III) complex was selected for the determination of the triplet state energy of the Qdca2\u2212 anion because the triplet energy level of the ligand is not significantly affected by the Ln(III) ions, and the lowest-lying excited level of the Gd(III) ion, 6P7/2, is located above 32,000 cm\u22121 [33]. Thus, the phosphorescence spectrum of [Gd2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O allowed evaluating the triplet energy level Qdca2\u2212 for all our studied lanthanide(III) complexes.

Thus, the phosphorescence spectrum of [Gd2(Qdca)3(H2O)4]\u00b7H2O allowed evaluating the triplet energy level Qdca2\u2212 for all our studied lantha ide(III) complexes. From this recorded spectrum, the triplet state energy of Qdca2\u2212 was determined to be 21,322 cm\u22121 on the basis of the maximum of the phosphorescence band located at 469 nm (as shown in Figure S17). The triplet level of Qdca2\u2212 was found to be moderately higher than that of 2,4\u2032-biphenyldicarboxylic acid and slightly lower than that of 4-quinoline carboxylic acid [56,57]. In order to transfer the energy from the ligand to the lanthanide ion, the triplet state energy needs to be higher than the resonance level of the metal ion. The excited levels of Eu(III) 5D0, and Tb(III) 5D4 are 17,265 and 20,500 cm\u22121, respectively [33]. The energy differences between the triplet state of Qdca2\u2212 and the resonance energy level of 5D0 and 5D4 (E(T1) \u2212 E(5Dj)]) can be calculated as 4057 and 822 cm\u22121, respectively. A differenc of 2000\u201350 1 is necessary to efficiently sensitize the luminescence of the lanthanide [58,59]. These ener y differences show that Qdca2\u2212 can effectively sensitize Eu(III) ions. On the other hand, the energy back transfer is responsible for the lack of emission of Tb(III) ions [60]. Latva et al. reported that the energy back transfer occurs when the difference between the lowest energy level of the ligand in the triplet state and the 5D4 emission level of the Tb(III) ion is less than 1850 cm\u2212l [59]. In order to complete spectroscopic analysis of the obtained europium(III) coordination polymers, the quantum yield and luminescent lifetimes were measured and analyzed. The\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6360 19 of 26\nluminescence decay curves of these complexes were investigated at the maximal excitation and emission wavelengths (Figure S18). The decay curves for Eu(III) samples prepared in 100 \u25e6C and 150 \u25e6C were adjusted with a single exponential function, and the lifetime values (\u03c4) of the 5D0 emitting level were found to be 202.7 \u00b1 0.2 and 200.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5s, respectively. The experimental data were fitted with R2 = 0.9980 using a single exponential function. Because the luminescence lifetime of Ln(III) is very sensitive to the composition of the inner coordination sphere [61,62], the short lifetimes determined herein can be attributed to the presence of luminescence quenchers, H2O molecules, in the coordination spheres of Eu(III) ions. The numbers of water molecules in these compounds calculated from Kimura\u2019s empirical rule [63] were determined to be 4.5 (with an accuracy of 0.5 molecule). The obtained results indicate the presence of water molecules in the first coordination sphere of the metal ions as shown earlier. The emission quantum efficiency of the 5D0 emitting level of the Eu(III) ion for the sample prepared at 150 \u25e6C was determined according to Equation (1)\n\u03c6 = IemEu3+\nIexLa2O3 \u2212 IexEu3+ \u00b7100% (1)\nwhere \u03c6 is the quantum yield, IemEu3+ is the integrated intensity of sample luminescence, and IexLa2O3 and IexEu3+ are the integrated intensities of scattered excitation radiation not absorbed by the reference (La2O3) and the integrated intensities of the scattered excitation light for the investigated material, respectively. All procedures were carried out in accordance with [64,65]. The luminescence quantum yield was calculated as 0.023. Figure 11 presents the emission spectra of the Nd(III) coordination polymers. These spectra were recorded at room temperature under 369 nm LED pumping, in the nearinfrared (NIR) region from 900 to 1700 nm. The complexes show characteristic NIR emissions of the Nd(III) and Er(III) ions. The emission spectra of Nd(III) arose from the excited state 4F3/2 in the form of two transitions, 4F3/2\u21924I11/2 (1047 nm) and 4F3/2\u21924I13/2 (1323 nm) [66]. All the emission peaks were identical, except for the peak intensities. The 4F3/2\u21924I11/2 transition (1047 nm) was the most intense and dominated the emission spectra of the complexes. Slight differences in the intensity of these transitions could be attributed to the slightly different number of water molecules in these compounds, as shown in Table 1. The energy of the triplet state of Qdca2\u2212 existed 9795 cm\u22121 above the 4F3/2 (11,527 cm\u22121) emitting level of Nd(III). The energy gap between the ligand triplet state and the emitting level of lanthanide ion in the case of the present Nd(III) complexes is larger than the optimum range for effective transfer of energy. Therefore, non-radiative decay of excited states can occur with high efficiency, resulting in lower emission intensity of Nd(III) ions.
