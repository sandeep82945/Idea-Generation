"The numerical examples, for which complete input and output data are reported, are drawn from Russiaâ€™s war on Ukraine, both illustrative examples as well as larger scale ones, which are solved using an implemented computational scheme. The flexibility of the modeling and algorithmic framework allows for the investigation quantitatively of the impacts of different scenarios with features of exchange rates plus various policies and the addition/deletion of markets and trade routes. The results strongly confirm the importance of efficient transportation routes for trade and also the benefits of subsidies for agricultural trade for both farmers and consumers."
