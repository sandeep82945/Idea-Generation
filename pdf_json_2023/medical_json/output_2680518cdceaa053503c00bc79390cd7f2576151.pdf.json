    "abstractText": "Dendrigraft Poly-L-Lysine (d-PLL) coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized by reducing Tetrachloroauric acid with ascorbic acid in the presence of d-PLL. AuNPs-d-PLL formed a stable colloidal solution that absorbs light at a maximum wavelength (\u03bbmax) centered at 570 nm as demonstrated by UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. From Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis, AuNPs-d-PLL were spherical in shape with a mean diameter of 128 \u00b1 47 nm. Dynamic Light scattering (DLS) analysis of the colloidal solution exhibited one size distribution with a hydrodynamic diameter of about 131 nm (size distribution by intensity). Zeta potential (\u03be) measurements revealed positively charged AuNPs-d-PLL with \u03be about 32 mV, an indicator of high stability in an aqueous solution. The AuNPs-d-PLL was successfully modified with either thiolated poly (ethylene glycol) SH-PEG-OCH3 (Mw 5400 g mol-1) or folic acid-modified thiolated poly (ethylene glycol) SH-PEG-FA of similar molecular weight as demonstrated via DLS and Zeta potential measurements. Complexation of PEGylated AuNPs-d-PLL with siRNA was confirmed by DLS and gel electrophoresis. Finally, we analyzed the functionalization of our nanocomplexes with folic acid via targeted cellular uptake to prostate cancer cells using flow cytometry and LSM imaging. Our findings implicate the broader applicability of folate-PEGylated AuNPs in siRNA-based therapeutics against prostate cancer and perhaps other types of cancer.",

            "text": "Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death in men despite of innumerable research studies and clinical applications using myriads of anti-cancer drugs and radioactive agents [1-3]. The emergence of nanomedicine has diverged from the route of chemotherapy to consider molecular therapies as promising agents to combat resistant tumors and untreatable diseases [4, 5]. Potential molecules to treat diseases include small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA), also known as short interfering RNA, or silencing RNA molecules that can selectively down-regulate genes implicated in the pathology of the disease [6-8]. Due to enzymatic degradation, renal\nclearance, and electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged phospholipidic membrane, unprotected siRNA exhibits a short plasma half-life [9, 10]. Therefore, the complexation of siRNA with nanoparticles (NPs) has been recently exploited to improve siRNA-based therapeutic applications in cancer treatment [9, 11]. In fact, it has been demonstrated that NPs-siRNA cargos can shield naked siRNA from degradation and can be further modified with a ligand to specifically recognize a tumor cell with targeted siRNA delivery [12, 13]. NPs capped with positively charged molecules show increased interactions with cellular membranes,\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\nhttps://www.ntno.org\n153\nenhancing their endocytosis [14, 15]. Moreover, besides their particular size and shape-dependent optical properties, gold NPs (AuNPs) stand out as vehicles to shuttle siRNA as they exhibit low cytotoxicity and high affinity to thiols and amines that facilitate their functionalization with biomolecules containing such groups (i.e., antibodies, proteins, and thiol terminated ligands) [16, 17]. AuNPs proved to be useful tools in many biomedical applications such as bioimaging, photothermal therapy, and drug delivery [18, 19]. For successful use in siRNA delivery, AuNPs should exhibit a positively charged surface to complex the negatively charged siRNA. It has been previously demonstrated that non-toxic, surfactantfree, and positively charged AuNPs could be obtained using L-cysteine and polyethyleneimine (PEI) as stabilizers [17, 20]. PEI is now widely used in the synthesis of NPs and the delivery of siRNA, since it was shown that a decrease in the pH of cells allows PEI to become protonated, hence facilitating endosomal escape and destabilization of endosomal membranes [21-23]. Previously, it was reported that AuNPs-PEI 2KD and AuNP-PEI 25KD can both complex siRNA; however, only PEI-25KD delivers siRNA into PC-3 cancer cells (~98%) [14]. Interestingly, the low uptake of AuNPs-PEI 2KD could be enhanced by modification with a targeting ligand (such as anisic acid (AA) or folic acid (FA)) [17, 23]. In fact, Au-PEI-AA mediated efficient siRNA uptake into PC-3 prostate cancer cells via binding to sigma receptors [23]. Similarly, AuNPs-PEI-FA specifically delivered siRNA into prostate cancer cell lines via binding to folate receptors. Normal cells and tissues have limited expression of folate receptors while most cancer cell lines overexpress folate receptors to enhance their proliferation [24, 25]. This resulted in enhanced endogenous gene silencing compared to the non-targeted AuNPs-PEI [17]. However, AuNPs-PEI-FA size increased by threefold after siRNA complexation, mainly due to some flocculation. Therefore, the novelty of this study is integrating PEGylation into the nanocomplex model in the presence or absence of folic acid to control AuNP\u2019s size, dispersion, and delivery. Also, before PEGylation, we used dendrigraft poly-L-lysine (d-PLL) to stabilize AuNPs in water. To prepare a narrow-molecular-weight distribution of two P-LL (P2) polymers, we followed the same procedure reported by Collet et al. [26]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that four distinct generations of d-PLL can be obtained via the slow hydrolysis of the side chain-protected building block Lys (Tfa)-NCA [27]. However, second-generation equivalents, particularly the guanidinylated derivatives, were found to be an interesting candidate for medication and gene\ndelivery due to their biodegradable nature [28]. AuNPs-d-PLL, with a diameter of about 128 nm, were obtained by one-pot chemical reduction of Tetrachloroauric (III) acid trihydrate (HAuCl4.3H2O) with L-ascorbic acid in the presence of d-PLL. The obtained AuNPs-d-PLL were further modified with SH-PEG5000-OCH3 (Mw 5400 g.mol-1) or SH-PEG5000-FA as confirmed by DLS and Zeta potential measurements. Compared to PEGylated AuNPs-d-PLL, folate-PEGylated NPs showed enhanced specificity and delivery of siRNA to PC-3 PSMA cells. Thus, our nano-formulation proves to outperform existing models in the literature and can be customized with any siRNA to target PC or other types of cancer overexpressing folate receptors."

Finally, the presence of H-C=C stretching at 3008 cm-1 and the presence of C=C at 1606 cm-1 and 1511 cm-1 is indicative of the presence of (phenyl and pterin rings) of folic acid, further confirming the successful attachment of FA to SH-PEG-NH2 [33].\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\nhttps://www.ntno.org\n157\nSimilarly, UV-vis analysis on folic acid and\nSH-PEG-FA show that the latter exhibited characteristic absorption peaks of folic acid with a slight shift at about 282 nm and 350 nm, confirming the successful attachment of folic acid to SH-PEG-NH2, as demonstrated in Figure 2B.\nCharacterization of differently coated AuNPs (d-PLL, PEG, PEG-FA) and siRNA complexation\nFor successful characterization of the physicochemical properties of SH-PEG-FA, we ought to test the effect of d-PLL coating on the overall charge and size using DLS/Zeta potential measurements and UV-visible spectroscopy. Therefore, AuNPs-d-PLL particles were further modified with folate-targeted (SH-PEG-FA) or untargeted (SH-PEG-OCH3) thiola-\nted poly (ethylene glycol). Thiol groups have a high affinity for the surface of AuNPs, facilitating the formation of AuNPs-SH-PEG-FA and AuNPs-SHPEG-OCH3 complexes. Based on our DLS findings, AuNPs-d-PLL had a hydrodynamic diameter of 118.8 \u00b1 1 nm (Z avg), which increased with the gradual addition of SH-PEG-FA, reaching a size of 125.5 \u00b1 5 nm (Table 1). AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG revealed the largest diameter of 133.1 \u00b1 0.9 nm (Z avg) when compared to the previously mentioned particles in Figure 3. As for the surface charge of AuNP complexes, AuNPs-d-PLL registered a positive charge of +32 \u00b1 1.3 mV, and steadily dropped upon the addition of SH-PEG-OCH3 and SH-PEG-FA, reaching +30.2 \u00b1 0.9 for AuNPs-dPLL-PEG-FA and +21 \u00b1 1 mV for AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG (Table 1, Figure 4).\nThe UV visible spectra of the resulting AuNPs-d-\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\n158\nPLL-PEG nanoparticles show a clear redshift of about 4 nm from 570 to 574 nm for AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG-FA and 6 nm from 570 to 576 nm for AuNPs-d-PLLPEG-OCH3. A successful attachment of PEG to the surface of the AuNPs was further demonstrated by the absence of any evidence of aggregation (Figure 5). Interestingly, AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG retained a positive surface charge and were able to further complex with siRNA with or without folate, as shown in Scheme 1. Characterized AuNPs-d-PLL were then complexed with two concentrations of siRNA (25 and 50 nM), while maintaining a constant MR at 25 of AuNPs.siRNA across all samples. For particles subjected to 25 nM siRNA, AuNPs-d-PLL.siRNA demonstrated an increase in hydrodynamic diameter reaching 123.5 \u00b1 2.2 (Z avg), as seen in Table 2. Furthermore, AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG.siRNA exhibited a Z avg of 135 \u00b1 4 nm compared to AuNPs-d-PLLFA.siRNA with an average size of 193.5 \u00b1 1.9 nm (Table 2). The greatest change was observed when measuring AuNPs surface charge upon the addition of the very negatively charged siRNA. AuNPs-d-PLL. siRNA 25 nM witnessed a decrease in zeta potential\nfrom +32 \u00b1 1.3 mV to -21.13 \u00b1 0.5 mV, followed by PEGylated forms, AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG.siRNA 25 nM, with a charge of -14.13 \u00b1 4.87 mV, and finally the surface charge decreased from +30.2 \u00b1 0.9 mV to reach -11.41 \u00b1 3.78 mV for AuNPs-d-PLL-FA.siRNA 25 nM (Table 2). Subsequently, for particles subjected to 50 nM siRNA, the same analysis was performed and similar results were observed (Table 3). As seen in Figure 6, particles exhibited a slight increase in their average size, without any sign of aggregation. AuNPs-d-PLL.siRNA 50 nM attained the highest Z avg of 139.6 \u00b1 1.3 nm followed by AuNPs-dPLL-FA.siRNA 50 nM (Z avg of 136 \u00b1 1.5 nm), and finally an average diameter of 134 \u00b1 1 nm for AuNPsd-PLL-PEG.siRNA 50 nM. Lastly, particles also exhibited noticeable changes in zeta potential. Based on the results in Table 3, AuNPs-d-PLL.siRNA 50 nM became strongly negative with a surface charge of -23.6 \u00b1 2 mV, followed by AuNPs-d-PLL-FA.siRNA 50 nM with a zeta potential of -11.5 \u00b1 1.5 mV, and finally AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG.siRNA 50 nM with a surface charge of -4.4 \u00b1 1.4 mV.\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\nhttps://www.ntno.org\n159\nTable 2.

Readings were performed in triplicates in disposable folded capillary tubes (All NPs at Mass: Ratio 25) (n = 3)\nToxicity testing of various AuNPs Despite the importance of deciphering the physicochemical properties of our AuNPs to deliver siRNA, what remains at stake is their cytotoxic effect. This is easily tested in vitro using colorimetric assays, such as WST-1. WST-1 reduction is highly dependent on the glycolytic production of NAD(P)H in viable\nPC-3 PSMA cells. Data reported in Figure 7 support the non-cytotoxic effects of AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG-FA (50 \u00b5g/mL) since the percent viability remained above 80% for all the selected time points. Even after a 24-hour incubation period, the percent viability remained satisfactory, with around 80% viability as compared to the control.\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\nhttps://www.ntno.org\n160\nGel Electrophoresis for siRNA complexation of differently coated AuNPs (PLL, PEG, PEG-FA)\nTo elucidate the capacity of our NPs to bind siRNA, siRNA complexation was visualized in situ on a 1.5% agarose gel. AuNPs-d-PLL.siRNA complexation was initiated at MR 10, with a slight decrease in band intensity at MR 20, followed by complete band\ndisappearance at MR 30, marking total AuNPs-dPLL.siRNA complexation (Figure 8). On the other hand, AuNP-d-PLL-PEG OCH3.siRNA complexation at MR 10 was less evident when compared to AuNPs-d-PLL.siRNA, with a similar decrease in band intensity at MR 20 (Figure 8, panels A and B). Similarly, complete complexation was achieved at MR 30. Finally, AuNP-d-PLL-PEG FA.siRNA complexation in panel C was less noticeable at MR 10 when compared to NPs in panels A and B. However, comparably to NPs from panels A and B, complexation became prominent at MR 20 and finalized at MR 30. The latter indicates that complete siRNA complexation was achieved between MR20 and MR30, irrespective of the coating agent used on our AuNPs. Lastly, positively charged AuNPs-d-PLL (+32 \u00b1 1.3 mV) showed the earliest signs of siRNA complexation with the faintest band intensity at MR 10 (Figure 8, panel A).\nCellular Uptake of various AuNPs complexes by flow cytometry\nCounts of fluorescently labeled siRNA-PSMA were compared among different doses and types of NPs, as illustrated in Figure 9. Concerning side scattering, no significant change was observed among the samples (panel A). Therefore, quantification of cells containing FITC-labeled-siRNA was performed. Based on a method adopted by Shin et al 2020, the percentage of cells containing FITC siRNA was calculated from cells with higher FITC signals than the threshold [20]. This threshold value was calculated from the median + robust SD (retrieved from FlowJo) of the control, untreated samples (panel B), allowing for statistically meaningful measurements. Then, the data was extracted and plotted using Excel (panel C). In terms of fluorescence, a non-remarkable fluorescent FL-1 intensity corresponds to the FITC siRNA signal as observed for naked siRNA and AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG.siRNA (Figure 9C). On the other hand, increased FL-1 fluorescence was marked for 25 and 50 nM AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG-FA.siRNA, which is quite significant compared to naked siRNA-NPs (~ 17%, and ~ 30%, respectively). As depicted in the bar graph, the highest mean fluorescence peaked with AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG-FA.siRNA at 50 nM concentration compared to the low FL-1 levels of PSMA-siRNA lacking NPs. Interestingly, untreated PSMA-PC3 cells showed background levels similar to PSMA-siRNA at 25 nM. Moreover, AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG, at both 25 and 50 nM siRNA, showed no significant difference in fluorescence compared to control samples; the only difference was for cells incubated with AuNPs-dPLL-PEG-FA.\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\nhttps://www.ntno.org\n161\nUptake of fluorescein-siRNA conjugated NPs in PC-3 PSMA cells\nTo decipher the exact subcellular localization of AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG-FA.siRNA 50 nM, cells were incubated with the NP complexes for 4 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Then they were fixed and stained with Hoechst, early endosomal marker (EEA1), or lysosomal marker (M6PR). AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG-FA.siRNA 50 nM was also visualized as dot-like structures dispersed in the cytoplasm, with remarkable perinuclear presence (Figure 10D and E, pseudo-green panels). Next, to determine the uptake pathway, we ought to merge the siRNA stain with EEA1 and M6PR stains. Interestingly, almost 30% of cells showed slight yellow zones indicating co-stains with the endosomal marker (Figure 10D and E, overlay). This overlap was only remarkable in cells treated with AuNPsFA.siRNA and was absent in PSMA cells treated with AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG.siRNA 50 nM (Figure 10B and C, overlay). Finally, as a last resort to confirm AuNPs internalization, Z-stack imaging was performed. Samples with AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG-FA.siRNA 50 nM and AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG.siRNA 50 nM were selected for a series of twenty consecutive images captured at focal distances ranging from \u2013 10 \u00b5m to +10 \u00b5m. A set\nof eight images was chosen as a representative for both AuNPs-siRNA\u2013FA 50 nM (Figure 11, panel A) and AuNPs-siRNA\u2013OCH3 50 nM (Figure 11, panel B), respectively. A significant decrease in FITC intensity was noted for AuNPs-PEG.siRNA when compared to AuNPs-FA.siRNA. In addition, particles were only observed in sections ranging from \u2013 2 \u00b5m to + 1\u00b5m in cells incubated with AuNPs-FA.siRNA, while they were completely absent in cells incubated with AuNPs-PEG.siRNA. Furthermore, a 2D render series of 1 frame/second was created to demonstrate this phenomenon (Video S1, data not shown). These findings indicate that our AuNPs are taken up by cells and reside in the cytoplasm."

            "text": "Folate receptors are cellular membrane glycoproteins comprising three isoforms, namely FR\u03b1, FR\u03b2, and FR\u03b3 [23]. Folate receptors bind folic acid (FA) and structurally similar FA derivatives and mediate cellular delivery of these compounds. It has been established that folate receptors are overexpressed in many malignant tissues, including prostate cancer, while their expression is minimal in healthy tissues [21, 23]. Targeted delivery via folate receptors can be utilized to increase efficacy and reduce the toxicity of medicinal agents for cancer therapy [22]. In this study,\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\nhttps://www.ntno.org\n162\nFA was chosen as a targeting ligand and attached to thiolated poly (ethylene glycol) via an amide linkage to produce SH-PEG-FA [33]. The latter was grafted onto positively charged AuNPs, synthesized via a chemical reduction in the presence of dendrigraft Poly-L-Lysine (d-PLL). The final cargo AuNPs-d-PLLPEG-FA was found to successfully complex/deliver siRNA to prostate cancer cells. On the other hand, in a study published by Mbatha et al. FA modified poly(amidoamine) generation5 (PAMAM G5D) functionalized gold nanoparticles were used for\nsiRNA luciferase gene slicing in folate receptor expressing HeLa-Tat-Luc cells [34]. Their NPs were able to successfully complex and shield siRNA in-vitro. Additionally, the nano-formulations were non-cytotoxic and expressed formidable gene silencing capabilities [34]. Furthermore, Chitosan and PEG400/PEG2000 functionalized AuNPs were also used to effectively deliver siRNA in-vitro for c-MYC silencing in an MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line [35]. Such nanocomposites demonstrated a 90% decrease in MYC protein formation [35].\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\nhttps://www.ntno.org\n163\nIn our study, the strong positively charged\nnature of AuNPs facilitated the complexation with the negatively charged FAM siRNA via ionic charge interaction. In the case of AuNPs-d-PLL, the particles were shown to possess a high positive charge of 32 \u00b1 1.3 mV. The latter allowed them to complex siRNA even at a low MR. As evident by gel electrophoresis, complexation is apparent at MR 10, but entirely achieved at MR 30. For AuNPs-d-PLL slightly neutralized with PEG-OCH3; the particles had the least positive zeta potential resulting in a fainter band at MR 10 when compared to AuNPs-PLL. However, as the MR of AuNPs-d-PLL-OCH3 to siRNA increased, complexation also increased until it was fully achieved at MR 30. Finally, concerning siRNA complexation with AuNPs-d-PLL-FA; the particles presented a zeta potential which is slightly less positive than AuNPs-d-PLL. The complexation pattern of these particles should be similar to\nAuNPs-d-PLL. Since FA is a larger molecule, it is believed to cause some steric interference, hindering the complexation with siRNA. The latter results in slightly more visible bands when comparing panels A and B at MR 10 [14]. Nonetheless, complete AuNPs-d-PLL-FA.siRNA complexation was achieved at MR 30. These results are aligned with J. Guo et al. previous findings, in which PEI-capped AuNPs behaved similarly, achieving complete siRNA complexation at minimal MR 20 for AuNPs-PEI-FA [14]. Furthermore, results from another study by X. Luan et al. demonstrated full binding of siRNA with Au110-PEI-PEG5000 and Au110-PEI-PEG5000-AA at final MR40 [36]. These observations indicate that our NP complexes can easily and successfully complex siRNA for potential in vitro and in vivo cargo delivery. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis supplemented the electrophoresis readings to determine the optimal siRNA concentration for internalization. Results show\nNanotheranostics 2023, Vol. 7\nhttps://www.ntno.org\n164\nthat FA complexes, unlike OCH3 samples, bind to PC3-PSMA cells. There was no significant difference in the side scattering across the tested samples. This might be due to the negative surface charge of our NPs post siRNA complexation, causing slight repulsion with the negatively charged lipid bilayer of the cells [20]. However, a clear increase in FL-1 intensity was present, especially for cells incubated with AuNPs-d-PLL-FA.siRNA at 50 nM. When incubated with AuNPs-d-PLL-PEG.siRNA at either 25 or 50 nM siRNA concentration, minimal fluorescence was detected (\u2264 5%). This suggests that AuNPs-d-PLL-OCH3.siRNA do not bind to the FA receptors of the PC-3 PSMA cells. On the other hand, cells incubated with AuNPs-d-PLL-FA.siRNA (25 nM) presented a mean percent fluorescence of ~ 17%, indicating some interaction with PC-3 PSMA cells. Finally, cells incubated with AuNPs-d-PLL-FA.siRNA (50 nM) had the highest mean percent fluorescence, indicating that our AuNPs-FA complexes exhibit a specific binding capacity to FA receptors on the cell surface of PC-3 PSMA cells [37] and that a 50 nM concentration of siRNA is adequate for intracellular localization. Laser scanning microscopy was challenging because it was difficult to pinpoint the exact method of AuNP uptake. PC-3 PSMA cells were incubated with AuNPs.FA.siRNA at 50 nM and AuNPsOCH3.siRNA at 50 nM. Cells with AuNPs.FA showed vesicle-like structures while cells with AuNPs.OCH3 showed almost no siRNA signal. This is most likely an indication of particle internalization via the late secretory pathway. However, it was not enough to confirm that the particles reside in the cytoplasm. Therefore, cells were incubated again with AuNPs. FA.siRNA at 50 nM and AuNPs-OCH3.siRNA at 50 nM. Co-staining with EEA-1 1/100 and M6PR 1/150 was performed to identify whether the complexes are enclosed within early endosomes or lysosomes. After numerous attempts, we were unable to detect an overlapping siRNA signal for either EEA-1 or M6PR. To undermine the exact location of our NPs, we supported the hypothesized observation that nanoparticles coated with positively charged and low pka amino groups, such as PEI or d-PLL, can undergo a process called the sponge effect and are most likely packaged in acidic vesicles [38]. Through this process, cationic NPs bypass the cell surface lipid bilayer and enter acidic vesicles, where their amino groups sequester protons supplied by the proton pump, v-ATPase. Furthermore, the sequestered protons cause the pump to remain functioning, leading to the retention of chloride ions and water molecules. Finally, osmotic swelling ruptures the vesicles releasing the cationic NPs into the cytoplasm [38].\nThis phenomenon has been repeatedly noted with NPs possessing a positively charged coating and is generally an acceptable hypothesis when dealing with positively charged polymers, like PEI and its derivatives [39]."

            "text": "siRNA-based applications to treat cancer cells can only be successful if siRNA is properly shielded and specifically delivered to the target tumor site. Many nano-vehicles have been designed and reported in the literature. However, our proposed model of gold NPs features a new formulation. This includes not only a PEGylated shell, but also a dendrigraft of poly-L-lysine polymers to stabilize the NPs for better siRNA coating. To top it all off, the NPs were functionalized with folic acid solving the key problem of differentiating between healthy and malignant cells. The overexpression of folic acid receptors by proliferating tumor cells serves as natural ligands to signal site-specific binding of our nanocomposites. Although cellular uptake, intracellular localization, and siRNA mechanism of action dictate the functionality of NPs, we show here that the physicochemical properties of the nanocomposites are vital properties that govern the upstream biological behavior of all NPs. Thus, the reported nano-size, charge, and chemical coats in our NP formulations are sufficient to demonstrate minimal cytotoxicity, optimal siRNA-loading capacity, and specific binding to our tested prostate cancer cells. Further progress in this direction will help monitor the efficiency of gene regulation in prostate or other types of cancer. Finally, translating the application of our tested NPs (AuNPs-d-PLLFA.siRNA) from in vitro to a mouse model underpins the biocompatibility, biodistribution, and overall efficacy of using our nanocomposites as molecular cancer therapeutics."
