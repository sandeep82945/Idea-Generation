ABSTRACT Objectives General practitioners (GPs) and their staff have been at the frontline of the SARSCoV2 pandemic in Australia. However, their experiences of responding to and managing the risks of viral transmission within their facilities are poorly described. The aim of this study was to describe the experiences, and infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies adopted by general practices, including enablers of and challenges to implementation, to contribute to our understanding of the pandemic response in this critical sector. Design Semistructured interviews were conducted in person, by telephone or online video conferencing software, between November 2020 and August 2021. Participants Twenty general practice personnel working in New South Wales, Australia, including nine GPs, one general practice registrar, four registered nurses, one nurse practitioner, two practice managers and two receptionists. Results Participants described implementing wideranging repertoires of IPC strategies\u2014including telehealth, screening of patients and staff, altered clinic layouts and portable outdoor shelters, in addition to appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE)\u2014to manage the demands of the SARSCoV2 pandemic. Strategies were proactive, influenced by the varied contexts of different practices and the needs and preferences of individual GPs as well as responsive to local, state and national requirements, which changed frequently as the pandemic evolved. Conclusions Using the \u2018hierarchy of controls\u2019 as a framework for analysis, we found that the different strategies adopted in general practice often functioned in concert with one another. Most strategies, particularly administrative and PPE controls, were subjected to human variability and so were less reliable from a human factors perspective. However, our findings highlight the creativity, resilience and resourcefulness of general practice staff in developing, implementing and adapting their IPC strategies amidst constantly changing pandemic conditions. INTRODUCTION The SARSCoV2 pandemic has burdened health systems worldwide, including general practice (family medicine), at the frontline of community access to healthcare. Reports and reflections on the role of general practice in wellresourced countries describe shifts to remote consultations, practice reorganisation and contributions to public health messaging and education. They also describe anxieties around resources, income, information, public access to care and risks of infection. In Australia, general practitioners (GPs) and primary health networks have played a pivotal part in the national health pandemic strategy, responding with agility and ingenuity during a difficult and changing crisis. Two key aspects of the national primary care response were the expansion of Medicaresubsidised telehealth and the establishment STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY",

To achieve these aims, we designed and conducted a qualitative interview study, to explore the IPC experiences of Australian general practice personnel during the SARS- CoV- 2 pandemic. We describe, in this paper, the range of IPC strategies used in general practices, how the strategies were adapted in diverse contexts and the enablers and challenges experienced by participants in implementing each strategy."

Interviews varied between 30 min and 60 min and were audio- recorded and transcribed by an external third party who had signed a confidentiality agreement. Transcripts were reviewed iteratively by SH and FY for data saturation. PB continued recruitment until data saturation was achieved.\nInterview questions were designed to investigate IPC as a multidimensional concept, including practical strategies and controls, and the sociocultural, technical and ethical issues arising during a constantly evolving pandemic situation. The interview guide is available as a supplementary file. Questions focused on participants\u2019 experiences of the pandemic, in relation to: changes implemented at their workplaces, how they balanced risks and responsibilities as healthcare workers and their views on sources of support that were available during the pandemic.\nData analysis combined both inductive and deductive approaches.32 The process began with an initial familiarisation phase, where researchers (SH and FY) reviewed the transcripts and applied inductive coding to identify\nanalytical categories and build an overall picture of the data. Coding was carried out in NVivo V.12 (QSR International) by FY and SH. During this familiarisation process, we identified that a key topic described by participants in detail was the variety and novelty of IPC strategies implemented to manage transmission risks in their workplaces. A decision was made to take a deductive framework approach33 with this subset of codes, mapping participants\u2019 accounts of these strategies to the risk- mitigation framework known as the Hierarchy of Controls (first developed by the US National Safety Council34). The framework matrix also included codes relating to \u2018enablers\u2019 and \u2018challenges\u2019 for each level of the hierarchy, to identify the sociocultural, technical and ethical factors that either helped or hindered participants in implementing each kind of IPC strategy. See table 1 for a summary of the strategies, enablers and challenges mapped to this matrix.\nThis stage involved four members of the research team (PB, GLG, SH, FY) who were involved in charting data to the hierarchy, cross- checking and developing overall interpretations. Divergent cases were sought and discussed among the team to promote analytical rigour. Differences in interpretation were handled through iterative discussion until consensus was reached among all parties."

At the top of the hierarchy are actions taken to either eliminate the risk completely through removal of the risk from the workplace or workflow, or, if that is not possible, to substitute the risk (whether it is an unsafe material, process or procedure) with a less risky alternative. Next in the hierarchy are actions taken to physically separate workers from the risk through engineering of the work environment, followed by administrative controls (such as protocols, training, supervision, scheduling) designed to modify work practices, which depend on workers\u2019 compliance. Finally, the use of PPE is often seen as the most obvious strategy, but it is relatively unreliable, as its effectiveness depends on multiple unstable factors (e.g., adequate supplies of appropriate equipment, regular training and workers\u2019 competence in using it safely).35 In the patient safety literature, the hierarchy has been used to highlight a tendency towards over- reliance on weaker risk- mitigation strategies (such as administrative measures or PPE).36\nPrior to the SARS- CoV- 2 pandemic, the hierarchy was used by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 1990s to control a resurgence of tuberculosis37 and to manage care for patients with Ebola virus disease.38 Since 2020, however, the hierarchy has become widely\n(IIT P atna).

Most GPs and RNs worked across two or three different sites, including hospitals, GPRCs and vaccination hubs. Four GPs worked at rural sites; all other sites were metropolitan. Illustrative quotes from participants are included below.\nOverall, participants reported being motivated to avoid the risks of infection to themselves and others but were also mindful of the impact of a confirmed COVID- 19 case on the practice. Depending on local public health guidelines40 and level of exposure, this could involve a temporary closure of the practice for 2 weeks, with significant consequences for staff, patients and the business.\nI mean, when the outbreak happened, we also knew that if we got a positive case of COVID in our rooms here, then it would shut us down, and I think you\u2019re\nconscious of that. So [\u2026] for us on a Monday, that could be 99 [patients] that wouldn\u2019t be seen (P02, practice manager).\nParticipants reported adopting a wide range of workplace IPC strategies to reduce the risk of SARS- CoV- 2 exposure and illness. Some IPC strategies were reported by all participants, but there was also variation between, and sometimes within, practices. As the pandemic evolved, these IPC strategies were modified.\nRules were changing every week. I couldn\u2019t keep up. [\u2026] there was times when we were wearing masks and then we weren\u2019t wearing masks. [\u2026] So, everything was changing. There\u2019s been a million changes. And with triaging as well, who\u2019s let in, who\u2019s not let in. Just because I feel like no one has all the information, we\u2019re just winging it as we go (P05, receptionist).\nImportantly, despite the variation and uncertainty, many participants\u2014especially those who worked in the GPRCs\u2014reported feeling protected by the precautions.\nFamily and friends would say to me, \u2018We cannot believe you are doing this job on the frontline [in a GPRC] because [\u2026] they thought I was putting myself in danger. However, I would say I feel much safer where I am, than going to Woolworths and standing next to 60 people all trying to get toilet paper [\u2026.] I never felt unsafe because I knew that I was very well protected (P07, GP).\nIn the following sections, we present descriptions of these strategies within the hierarchy of controls\nFigure 2 Hierarchy of controls in general practice.

            "text": "The most effective type of control is elimination, which refers to the complete removal of the risk of exposure. For our participants, the only plausible elimination strategy was practice closure with no other consultations except telehealth, as any face- to- face interaction between staff or between staff and patients risked exposure. This could involve entire practices closing their doors to patient attendance, with staff working remotely, and conducting telehealth consultations. Mainly, this was applied at individual GP level, with some choosing to work from home doing telehealth- only consults.\nGPs considered telehealth extremely useful for certain kinds of consult (e.g., brief encounters, sharing results or providing repeat prescriptions) but unsuitable for others (e.g., those involving mental health issues or physical examination). Other difficulties included technical (poor connectivity, insufficient telephone equipment or lines), financial (restrictions and changes to Medicare funding) and logistical issues (e.g., patients waiting a long time for telehealth calls or having difficulty describing clinical signs).\nPeople would send in photos of rashes. They\u2019d have a spot, for instance, and they\u2019d do a nice close- up photo of this spot. Well, you\u2019ve got no idea, unless there\u2019s a ruler next to it, whether it\u2019s a three millimetre spot or a six centimetre spot because you\u2019ve got nothing to compare it with (P19, GP).\nWe had to get some extra phones and phone lines because all the phone lines were busy and then you couldn\u2019t get a phone line in or out. So they ended up purchasing some mobile phones for the doctors to use (P11, RN).\nAnother strategy that was mentioned by all participants and is often included under the category of elimination,3 20 is screening/risk assessment of patients and staff\u2014either remotely (eg, by phone or online) or in person (most commonly by an usher or receptionist at the entrance to the surgery). However, we categorised screening as an administrative control (see below), as our participants described it being highly dependent on patient and staff compliance with protocols and awareness of possible infectiousness. Following the human factors principles underlying the hierarchy,15 this means that the reliability of screening is uncertain, so it is more accurately classified as a strategy that reduces, but does not eliminate, transmission risk, by changing work practices."

Afterwards, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, my ventilator risk has just dropped by 90%.\u2019 Because I know that\u2019s what it means (P13, GP)."

Many of these strategies also involve administrative changes. Participants reported a wide variety of novel and creative strategies, varying by general practice, and over time. For instance, some practices installed portable shelters in carparks or backyards, or set up waiting and consultation areas in foyers and balconies, to provide better ventilation. Outdoors, the main challenges were inclement weather (cold and rain) and information technology (IT) connections.\nWe had an elderly GP and [\u2026] a staff member that was immune- compromised, and so they didn\u2019t want to let anybody into the practice [\u2026.] So we had a big tent for patients to wait 1.5 metres away, and we had a tent that the doctor and the nurse could sit in. And it took a while to get all that set up because we had to get IT support to get the laptop out there, to print inside, to work out all our processes (P07, GP).\nIndoors, surgery layouts were rearranged to redirect patient flow\u2014to separate (suspected) infectious from non- infectious patients, minimise numbers in the waiting room and increase physical distancing. For example, chairs were moved to separate waiting patients; signs and floor markings employed to direct patients; Perspex screens were installed around reception desks and, in one practice, artificial walls were built (to cohort staff and minimise disruption in the event of a COVID- 19 exposure).\nWhen we did start bringing patients back into the practice, they actually built a couple of artificial walls inside the practice [\u2026.] with clear plastic and a door in it. And the idea was, because it is such a big practice, there\u2019s like 10 doctors, [\u2026] hopefully the door was always to remain shut, and [\u2026] if there was a patient with COVID, hopefully [only] one half of the practice would have to shut down and the other half would remain open and stay operational (P15, GP).\nSome practices allocated specific rooms (and entrances and corridors) for patients with respiratory symptoms such as those who had returned a negative COVID- 19 test, or bypassed screening (deliberately or unwittingly). As noted above, there were also GPRCs, which saw only patients with respiratory symptoms.\n(IIT P atna).

So I made a respiratory room. So, outside that respiratory room I had [PPE available], and then they could be reviewed by a GP (P03, RN).\nPhysical layout made these strategies easier for some practices (e.g., having outdoor areas or spare rooms) than others (e.g., older style cottages, single entrance, small rooms). Participants also reported difficulty managing the logistics of seeing both respiratory and non- respiratory patients indoors. One GPRC had to manage patient flow within a residential apartment building, where the residents were uneasy about sharing an entrance with patients.\nSo [clinic 1] I felt was much better organised. So they had a line marked the 1.5 metre distance in the room, they had PPE that was plentiful and adequate. Whereas [at clinic 2], [\u2026.] the consultation rooms were a lot smaller. There was no way you could socially distance. You couldn\u2019t have a 1.5 metre barrier. And I think the screening of patients wasn\u2019t as great (P17, GP).\nSo there were initial issues [\u2026] trying to separate the space of the clinic with the residential block. [\u2026] What became a problem was the common area and the common entry and exit to the building. And so, it was reassuring people that [\u2026] the clinic was actually a very safe clinic. [\u2026] But we had to set up barriers and a certain flow in and out of the clinic so that this will separate the public (P07, GP).\nFinally, engineering controls (requiring administrative support) include physical access to and replenishment of appropriate PPE and hand sanitiser, supplies of which were uncertain at the start of the pandemic, with some practices better prepared than others.\nWe had one GP that was really onto it, that was really worried about what was going to happen. And she was really keeping an eye on everything [\u2026] So we purchased extra masks. We already had a whole lot of stock of PPE because of accreditation with the pandemic influenza plan. Part of that is that you have to have three months\u2019 worth of PPE (P11, RN).\n[The supply of masks] are occasionally just terrible. So, the batch we have at the moment, the ones that loop behind each ear, the bottom left loop breaks off, so I have to staple that back on (P08, GP)."

            "heading": "Administrative controls",
            "text": "One administrative control described by all participants was screening of patients. Patients were questioned about symptoms of respiratory illness, COVID- 19 test results and potential COVID- 19 exposure (through known contact,\nrecent travel overseas or local hotspots), to prevent people most at risk of being infectious from entering the facility.\nScreening can occur in person (e.g., by an usher or receptionist at the entrance to the surgery) or remotely (e.g., by phone or online) or in combination. Patients assessed as potentially infectious were offered telehealth appointments, or advised on alternative access to care as appropriate, including referral to a GPRC or hospital emergency department for assessment and management.\nParticipants reported that screening depended heavily on public cooperation and was most easily justified during increased community transmission. It also depended on clear communication to patients about what to expect prior to appointments; and clear, consistent protocols for staff.\nYeah, just making sure that we had the right processes in place. And that was making sure we were calling patients, every single patient, before they came into the clinic, telling them what we were doing, explaining to them if they had any symptoms that they needed to be going to a respiratory clinic or getting a swab, and triaging every patient that came in, making sure that we had that proper signage on the doors, making sure that every patient, at certain times in the last 12 to 18 months, was wearing a mask as they came into the practice (P16, GP).\nAll participants reported involvement in screening patients; however, strategies varied between individual practices and GPs. For instance, some restricted in- person consults to patients without respiratory symptoms, others were willing to see patients with respiratory symptoms if they had a negative COVID- 19 PCR test, and others made judgements on a case- by- case basis. One medical centre decided, for a period of time, to see children under 5 years of age with a respiratory illness, as they were not able to easily access healthcare services at that time in the local community.\nIn the end, we probably saw about 10% of people in real life. So they would ring up and we\u2019d talk on the phone and then we would realise that we really needed to see them and so we would get them in generally later in the day and see them in real life (P19, GP).\nWe were very concerned because there was [\u2026] no other private- practising GPs who were seeing children with COVID symptoms. [\u2026] And it was very infuriating for us because we\u2019d even have little ones who had a negative COVID test, whose GPs would not see them (P02, Practice manager).\nParticipants consistently described variations in the perceived quality and effectiveness of screening, with questions sometimes not asked or answered incorrectly or inaccurately. Another common difficulty was dealing with the anger and frustrations of patients who were denied appointments in person, including parents of young children. Patients\u2019 frustrations with screening were\n(IIT P atna).

So, in those situations I just tended to do the swabs there and then and see them and hope for the best (P19, GP).\nI think probably the most stressful part of it was probably dealing with mums of young kids, to be honest, more than anything else. Because I think life was so stressful for them because their children were unwell, a lot of them being in childcare [and] they couldn\u2019t just get to see a GP to have someone listen to their chest or look at their child\u2019s ears or things like that (P09, RN).\nParticipants regarded screening as an administrative, risk- assessment strategy that complemented (and necessitated) other strategies, to manage potentially infectious patients presenting in person. For instance, staff who performed screening in- person remained exposed to potentially infectious patients, relying on other strategies (such as outdoor ventilation and PPE) for protection.\nParticipants often described how administrative controls were useful when other measures were difficult to implement. For instance, protocols for screening, patient flow, distancing and cleaning were frequently mentioned in conjunction with efforts to engineer separation between people. Logistical administrative strategies included appointment scheduling (minimising waiting time), limiting consultations to 15 min and asking patients to wait in their cars. In some practices, receptionists interacted with patients only by telephone, but this was impractical if patients needed to deliver or collect items or make payments in person.\nIn another [GPRC] that I\u2019ve worked in, there is a separate entrance that the patients come into, then there\u2019s a certain flow, and they\u2019ll see the doctor, see the nurse, get swabbed, out a separate exit. This one was, come in, see people, come out same exit/entrance. So then we had to look at staggering the appointments so that patients wouldn\u2019t bump into each other [.\u2026] this was a learning, as time went on, but it was challenging (P07, GP).\nParticipants described the value of practice- wide communication processes such as regular meetings, and clear, consistent IPC protocols. In general, the success of these strategies was attributed to staff (such as practice managers, practice owners or senior GPs) who were well organised and well- informed.\nI remember driving to work going, \u2018What\u2019s today going to be like? What\u2019s going to happen today?\u2019 And you\u2019d walk in the door and everyone would be huddled together [\u2026.] The manager was really\nthe critical person because she was receiving all the bulletins from local health districts and Health Department advice and item numbers and telehealth updates (P13, GP)\nSome of these strategies reduced in intensity over time, such as the frequency of meetings and comprehensive cleaning, when the level of risk was felt to be lower.\nSo we wiped down everything [\u2026] for a short period, maybe a month or two [\u2026] but then when we weren\u2019t getting many cases, that\u2019s when we slowed things down a bit and we didn\u2019t (P10, RN).\nAdministrative measures are considered less reliable according to the hierarchy but provided a sense of order and played a valuable role in helping staff feel safe, when consistently applied.\nThe pandemic is a state of chaos, and I think everyone needs some sort of sense of order [\u2026.] to go into a clinic where you know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, you are guaranteed that, nothing is ever 100%, but you know that it\u2019s going to be run in a certain way and it has a formula, then there\u2019s a certain sense of comfort there, right?

But if I haven\u2019t got PPE that\u2019s too much of an ask\u2019 (P13, GP).\nP2/N95 respirators were described by some participants as offering more protection for the wearer than surgical masks, although perspectives varied on their use, except for aerosol- generating procedures. Participants described problems associated with mask- use, including discomfort and difficulty communicating with patients.\nI have a lot of older, deaf patients and it was just hard for them and they struggled. So when I didn\u2019t have to wear a mask, for certain patients I would actually just take it off because I was like, \u2018It\u2019s not worth the effort to try [communicating with masks on].\u2019 But that was in the time that we didn\u2019t have to. Whereas, now we have to (P15, GP).\nIn addition to masks, participants wore gloves, eye protection and gowns when seeing patients with suspected COVID- 19 symptoms.

Some participants also described protocols to remove their scrubs/clothing when returning home, similar to PPE doffing protocols. Some questioned the adequacy of training provided, particularly for non- clinical staff. Much like the tasks of ensuring supply and access, protocols and training are also administrative strategies that support the appropriate use of PPE.\nI would leave my scrubs and a separate pair of running shoes at work and get changed, and then at the end of the day, I was like, \u2018Now, where do I put the scrubs? In which bag? And then do I wash my hands?

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We found that healthcare workers in general practice implemented varied and flexible repertoires of IPC strategies, either proactively or in response to complex and evolving circumstances. These circumstances included: emerging scientific and clinical knowledge about the virus (SARS- CoV- 2) and the disease (COVID- 19); varying levels of \u2018lockdown\u2019 based on community transmission; changes to Medicare telehealth funding; the establishment of respiratory clinics; differing national, state and professional IPC guidelines, and strategies employed by other practices in the area. In individual practices, factors that hindered or helped the implementation of IPC strategies included: the locations and layouts of practice facilities; PPE supplies, and knowledge and confidence of staff about its use; clear and timely communication of information and guidance; individual differences in preferences, fears or risk tolerance; IT systems and patient populations.\nWe found that the pandemic was experienced as highly novel and constantly changing, such that participants spoke of continually reinventing their IPC strategies\u2014\u2018building a plane and flying it all in one go\u2019, as one GP described. Nevertheless, participants also saw benefits in maintaining some strategies into the future, such as increased hand hygiene, wearing of masks by both staff and patients and the use of telehealth, where appropriate.\nOur findings provide empirical support for our application of the hierarchy of controls in general practice settings. Our classification is aligned with some official guidance39 and provides support for amending others.12 13 In particular, our study demonstrates how screening strategies are more accurately described as administrative, as they are unreliable in practice. Our findings demonstrate how the hierarchy of controls can be usefully applied to guide pandemic IPC in general practice, but with some caveats.\nFirst, although the hazard to be controlled here is the risk of exposure to, and subsequent illness caused by SARS- CoV- 2, the virus is harboured and transmitted by members of the public\u2014patients, carers, family members and staff\u2014and it is impossible to reliably distinguish those who are infectious, but presymptomatic or asymptomatic, from those who are not infected. The \u2018strongest\u2019 control in the safety hierarchy\u2014elimination\u2014is difficult to apply in a general practice setting, as many clinical presentations benefit from a face to face visit, patients with chronic conditions require physical assessment and examination at regular intervals, and preventative care activities such as vaccinations and cervical screening require face to face contact.\nSecond, during a pandemic, the hazard is not limited to the workplace. Strategies applied at work may minimise the risk for workers there, but they remain vulnerable to exposure in the community\u2014such as on public transport while commuting to work, or from household members, while working from home. This means that strategies applied at the societal level (e.g., statewide restrictions on movement of people, vaccination, establishment of respiratory clinics, and federal subsidies for telehealth) necessarily impact on and function in concert with practice- level strategies.\nFor instance, federal funding of telehealth and GPRCs addressed some of the risks of reduced access to care, due to screening protocols adopted in general practice, and patients\u2019 reluctance to seek healthcare (as observed in previous epidemics).41 Within practices, as described above, engineering and administrative controls were often described by participants as functioning interdependently to manage logistics, communication, information and the provision and use of PPE.\nThe hierarchy of controls promotes a strategic preference for strategies that rely less on human behaviour and variability.34 Our findings suggest that, in a general practice context during a pandemic, ranking strategies by these criteria is only one approach but an important one, as it highlights the need to avoid relying solely on PPE. IPC advice however should also attend to how strategies from different levels of the hierarchy can be combined in general practices, adapted to meet the circumstances and needs of different general practices, at different points during the pandemic.36 Our findings demonstrate the creativity and innovation of general practice personnel in devising, trialling, adapting, and adapting to, the many strategies described to us in this study.
