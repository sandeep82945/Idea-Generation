    "abstractText": "A robust cell-free platform technology, ribosome display in combination with cloning, expression, and purification was utilized to develop single chain Fragment variable (scFv) antibody variants as pain therapy directed at the mouse cholecystokinin B (CCK-B) receptor. Three effective CCK-B peptide-specific scFvs were generated through ribosomal display technology. Soluble expression and ELISA analysis showed that one antibody, scFv77-2 had the highest binding and could be purified from bacterial cells in large quantities. Octet measurements further revealed that the CCK-B scFv77-2 antibody had binding kinetics of KD = 1.794 \u00d7 10\u20138 M. Molecular modeling and docking analyses suggested that the scFv77-2 antibody shaped a proper cavity to embed the whole CCK-B peptide molecule and that a steady-state complex was formed relying on intermolecular forces, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic force, and hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the scFv antibody can be applied for mechanistic intermolecular interactions and functional in vivo studies of CCK-BR. The high affinity scFv77-2 antibody showed good efficacy with binding to CCK-BR tested in a chronic pain model. In vivo studies validated the efficacy of the CCK-B receptor (CCK-BR) scFv77-2 antibody as a potential therapy for chronic trigeminal nerve injury-induced pain. Mice were given a single dose of the CCK-B receptor (CCK-BR) scFv antibody 3 weeks after induction of a chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain model, during the transition from acute to chronic pain. The long-term effectiveness for the reduction of mechanical hypersensitivity was evident, persisting for months. The anxietyand depression-related behaviors typically accompanying persisting hypersensitivity subsequently never developed in the mice given CCK-BR scFv. The effectiveness of the antibody is the basis for further development of the lead CCK-BR scFv as a promising non-opioid therapeutic for chronic pain and the long-term reduction of chronic painand anxiety-related behaviors.",

Introduction Single-chain variable antibody fragment (scFv) antibodies are opening a new era of\ntherapeutics, pharmacology, and pathophysiology research [1]. These technologies, used for over a decade as a cancer therapy, are overcoming previous challenges of providing therapeutic applications requiring central nervous system penetrance. Several scFvs antibodies are being investigated as therapeutics for arthritis, Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob, and Huntington\u2019s disease due to their solubility, small size, and ability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, unlike monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) available for migraine (Galcanezumab, Erenumab) [2\u20134]. These small, brain-penetrant antibodies are praised as having promising biotherapeutic applications for both the nervous and immune systems, now recognized as interactive in chronic pain. Despite the popularity of scFvs generated by ribosome display for immunotherapy, obtaining high-affinity scFvs from ribosome display libraries has remained a challe ging task [5]. Here, we have developed a rapid generation of scFv antibodies against a small peptide fragment of the mouse receptor for neuropeptide cholecystokinin CCK-B (CCK2) by ribosome display (Figure 1).\nUnderstanding how an antibody interacts with its targets is critical for the development of that antibody as a therapeutic drug. Molecular docking [6,7] and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation [8] methods provide an advantageous means for studying the interaction between antigens and antibodies. Therefore, the present work has also studied predictions for the interaction between scFv77-2 antibody and CCK-B peptide by molecular docking and MD simulation.\nValidation of the efficacy of the lead CCK-BR scFv antibodies for the reduction of hypersensitivity, anxiety-, and depression-like behaviors was investigated in a chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain model in mice persisting 3\u20134 months. The CCK-BR scFvs directed to a mouse CCKBR fifteen amino acid peptide sequence were engineered with the ultimate goal of humanizing the antibodies for use in reducing dose requirement and tolerance of opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain in patients.\nCCK-BR is involved in several different aspects of the human pain experience that are particularly prominent in females [9]. CCKBR and its neuropeptide ligand, CCK, are widely expressed in the sensory ganglia, spinal cord, and brain pain circuitry [10,11].\nUnderstanding how an antibody interacts with its targets is critical for the development of that antibody as a therapeutic drug.

CCK-BR is involved in several different aspects of the human pain experience that are particularly prominent in females [9]. CCKBR and its neuropeptide ligand, CCK, are widely expressed in the sensory ganglia, spinal cord, and brain pain circuitry [10,11]. Axotomy results in CCK upregulation in sensory neurons (30%) after 14 days [10]. A 4.7-fold upregulation of CCK-BR mRNA (p < 0.0001) is reported in a mouse sciatic nerve injury model [12]. Our microarray gene chip expression profile data identified > 4-fold\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11035 3 of 25\nupregulation (p < 0.0001) of CCK-BR mRNA post day 3 in trigeminal ganglia (TG) compared to na\u00efves in our chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain model [13]. CCK-BR mRNA remained upregulated 2.72-fold (p < 0.001) on post-day 21. In fact, CCKBR contributes to chronic pain in a variety of animal models, with gene expression changes over time [10,14,15]. Upregulation of CCK in primary sensory neurons is associated with morphine insensitivity in experimental neuropathic pain after sciatic nerve axotomy in the rat [10]. Abundant literature support is also available, casting CCK-B as a major player in anxiety, and panic disorder [16\u201318]. Block of the CCK-B receptor provides enhancement of morphine analgesia and opioid receptor tolerance [14,19\u201330]. More importantly, selective CCKBR antagonists enhance morphine analgesia and prevent/reverse tolerance without worsening respiratory depression in non-human primates and without side effects other than orthostatic dizziness in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Thus, CCKBR is an ideal candidate to impact both nociceptive and limbic components of chronic pain, identifying it as an important therapeutic target that as yet has no beneficial therapy available."

            "text": "To determine whether the ribosomal display is suitable for the generation of antibodies against the mouse CCK-B receptor, we immunized mice with a custom 15-amino-acid extracellular mouse sequence CCK-B receptor peptide (Supplementary Scheme S1) [31]. CCK-B contains an extra loop of amino acids in the extracellular domain; which may serve as a target for immunotherapy. For ribosome displayed scFv antibody libraries, the immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined to a 20-amino-acid flexible linker [(G4S)4] were constructed using cDNA, synthesized from RNA extracted from spleens of five mice (Figure 1, Supplementary Table S1), as described previously [32,33]. The amplified PCR product was the expected size of about 750 bp [31]. The final DNA template encoding the library flanked by a T7 site was used in an in vitro ribosome display with a single selection step with mouse CCK-B receptor peptide (Figure 1) [32]. The ribosome-displayed scFv library was panned against CCK-BR peptide with 3 rounds of selection, PCR products cloned into pGEM-T vector DNA, VH-VL transformants (up to 50 unique, diverse scFv clones) randomly selected, sequenced, and aligned using Clustal Omega. Their amino acid sequences were deduced, and three complementary determining regions (CDRs) and four framework (FW) regions were identified in each of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain fragments. A 20-amino-acid [(G4S)4] linker was also present. Following alignment with each other, significant diversity in the VH and VL chains was observed, especially in the CDRs. Variability was also noted in the framework regions. No two clones had identical VH or VL fragments. The aligned amino acid sequences of 7 clones using Clustal Omega from the library are shown in Figure 2. The framework regions (FRs) and CDRs were determined by the IMGT information system (https://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest?livret=0&Option=humanIg, accessed on 18 April 2023) [34]. The length of CDR1 VH, with an average length of 9 amino acid residues, CDR2 VH with an average length of 7 residues, CDR3 VH ranged from 9 to 13 amino acid residues, with an average length of 11 residues, CDR1 VL ranged from 5 to 12 with an average length of 11 residues, while 3 amino acid residues were found in CDR2 VL and 9 amino acid residues were found in CDR3 VL (Supplementary Table S2). Comparison of the heavy chain and light chain gene families of the isolated clones with VBASE2 Ig database (http://www.dnaplot.com, accessed on 18 April 2023) showed that VH and VL of these clones belonged to the mouse Ig heavy family VH2 and VH15 and light family IGKV2, IGKV8 and IGKV4/5, respectively (Supplementary Table S2).\nInt.

Prediction of scFv77-2 Interaction with CCK-BR Peptide In silico molecular analyses provided insights into the interaction between the scFv77-2 and its ligand, CCK-B peptide, using for that a homology model of the scFv assembly in a monomeric closed state. Docking studies were performed with the PIPER protein-protein docking program in the BioLuminate product. The analysis of the scFv77-2 monomer-CCK-B peptide putative interface and the 3D cartoon representation of the docked complex is depicted in Figure 6. The molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the mouse scFv77-2-mouse CCK-B peptide docking prediction with sufficiently large and highly stable interface with amino acid side chain residues of scFv forming electrostatic/aromatic/hydrophobic interactions with CCK-B counterparts (Figure 6, Supplementary Scheme S2 and S3). The scFv77-2 module was predicted to contact the CCK-B peptide residues Glu40, Arg45, Arg50, and Glu53 (Figure 6). The scFv77-2 residues implicated in such binding are positioned mainly at VH-CDR1, VH-CDR3, and VL-CDR1, as indicated in Figure 6. These results are comparable with the two-dimensional and three-dimensional structure of scFv in complex with CCK-B peptide. The hydrogen bond interactions of the complex were elucidated to validate the binding of the scFv to the CCK-B peptide predicted by the docking simulation studies. The number of hydrogen bonds between the scFv and CCK-B peptide complex (acceptor/donor) was calculated and matched for identity with the hydrogen bond residues predicted in the docking analysis (Figure 6). The residues involved in hydrogen bonding during the post-simulation analysis of trajectories were found as the same residues contributing to hydrogen bonding during the docking analysis. Post-simulation MMGBSA analysis showed binding energy of -33.74 Kcal/mol.\nFigure 5.

CCK-BR scFv for Evoked Hypersensitivity in Male and Female Mice The dose study published previously included 0.04 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg treatment 3 weeks post model induction [31]. A single CCK-BR scFv given in week 3 provided a delayed but durable alleviation tested through 10 weeks. A Zika scFv control was used to ensure that the positive effects were specific to the CCK-BR scFv and not an effect of the scFv alone. For both mechanical and cold hypersensitivity the higher doses were effective (0.4\u201340 mg/kg). The optimal dose selected was 4 mg/kg for subsequent studies. Initially given as an intraperitoneal injection, the optimal dose (4 mg/kg) was given once in week 3 to neuropathic pain model male and female mice (n = 10, more than one group, more than one scFv batch) (Figure 7A,B). No male versus female differences were evident. Intranasal administration of CCK-BR scFv was also effective. Evoked reflexive mechanical responses were tested at baseline and weekly after model induction. Single-dose (4 mg/kg, n = 4/dose) administration given intranasally (i.n., 6 \u00b5L) was equally effective compared to i.p. administration for alleviation of mechanical hypersensitivity (Figure 8A). Trigeminal nerve endings are abundant in the nasal cavity. Cold hypersensitivity was also reversed by the CCK-BR scFv as shown (Figure 8B). Cold hypersensitivity was not evident in mice with FRICT-ION chronic pain model treated with 4 mg/kg doses or greater.\nVertical bar indicates single i.p. or i.n. treatment with CCK-BR scFv * Euthanasia for tissue/blood collection \u22121 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Weeks Weekly Mechanical Threshold Testing\nscFv\nAcclimatization\nand Baseline Testing\nModel Induction Anxiety/Depression/Cognitive Tests\n* *\nScheme 1.

Pre-Treatment Is Not Efficacious\nEffective treatments were all given post-model induction. When the 4 mg/kg dose of CCK-BR scFv was given as a pre-treatment three weeks before induction of the FRICT-ION model, the scFv had no effect (Figure 9A). If the pre-treatment was followed by posttreatment at 3 weeks, effectiveness was similar to a single treatment given in week 3 alone (Figure 9A). Thus, there was no additive effect. When five daily treatments with scFv were given in week 3 there was no additional alleviation. Weekly (Figure 9B, green arrows and line) and biweekly (Figure 9B, black arrows and line) treatments may be more efficacious. In another case, there was no effect when prior treatment with the scFv was given before the acute surgical incision pain model. (Figure 9C).\nInt. J. Mol.

(A) Ipsilateral von Frey testing was not efficacious for reducing facial hypersensitivity if a pre-treatment (i.p.) with CCK-BR scFv was given once 3 weeks prior to FRICT-ION model induction. When a second dose was given in Week 3 after model induction, the same delayed, durable effect was seen as with the single dose at 3 weeks. (B) Multiple 4.0 mg/kg daily doses given to mice in week 3 had the same delayed but durable effect with a single\ndose ( daily dose given for 5 days, once a week, or every other week).

CCKB Pharmacologic Comparator LY225910 Mice with FRICT-ION were treated daily for 8 days with the pharmacologic comparator, the selective CCKB inhibitor LY225910 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle. The FRICT-ION model had been induced 7 weeks prior, and thus mice were fully hypersensitive. Mechanical threshold was tested with von Frey filaments each morning prior to the treatment (Figure 10). Attenuation of the hypersensitivity began by the day 5 treatment and was significantly persistent on days 6\u20138. These results found the efficacy was similar to the attenuation conferred by the single dose of CCKB scFv following a similar one week recovery time course. This suggests the mechanism of action for the scFv is also interference with the CCKB in the nociceptive system. The study provides support for potential use of the scFv for durable relief of orofacial hypersensitivity. Other future studies are required to confirm this indication.\nFigure 9.

Efficacy of CCK-BR scFv for Prevention of Pain-Related Anxiety The lead 77-2 scFv was selected based on the pK assessment and the mechanical hy-\npersensitivity trials determining the optimal administered dose was 4 mg/kg. Two different anxiety tests were employed to assess the effects of CCK-BR scFvs. CCK-BR scFvs given in week 3 diminished the anxiety-like behaviors that develop after 4\u20136 weeks of persistent hypersensitivity in FRICT-ION (or in any chronic model). Anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were tested once in chronic weeks 6\u201310 to avoid the practice effects reported with re-testing. Initially, a pilot test with 3 scFvs (14-3, 77-2, 134-1) for anxiety with the zero maze found only the 14-3 scFv was similar to na\u00efve mice for distance traveled (Figure 11A). Both scFvs 77-2 and 14-3 were effective in maintaining time in the open areas of the zero maze (Figure 11B). Dose-dependent data for the zero maze assessing reduction of anxiety-like behavior found all doses of CCK-BR scFv 77-2 maintained distance traveled equivalent to na\u00efve mice (Figure 11D). For a time in the open area of the zero maze the 3 highest doses of 77-2 scFv were effective for reducing that anxiety measure (Figure 11C).\nThe dose dependency data for the light/ dark anxiety test for male mice are shown in Figure 12, as well as data for females with the lead scFv (Figures 11\u201313). Untreated mice with FRICT-ION, mice treated with low dose 0.04 mg/kg CCK-BR scFv, and mice treated with the control Zika scFv all developed both anxiety and depression. The dose study in male mice indicated the higher doses (0.4, 4, and 40 mg/kg) did develop changes in rearing behaviors (Figure 12C), but not in light occupancy (Figure 12D) time measures.\nIn the female mice, the single 4 mg/kg dose tested prevented the development of all of the anxiety-like measures, with only the vehicle-treated FRICT-ION mice displaying anxiety with the light/dark test (Figure 12E,F).\nFigure 10.

Generation of CCKBR scFv\nSeven scFvs targeting CCK-BR generated using the robust platform technology were described here. This was accomplished with cell-free ribosome display in combination with cloning, expression, and purification of an anti-CCK-B scFv. Selection of a lead scFv antibody from the three with highest binding affinity allowed in vivo efficacy validation studies. Reduction of ongoing persisting pain was demonstrated with the lead CCK-BR scFv in in vivo studies with an orofacial neuropathic pain model. Aggregation is a common problem affecting biopharmaceutical development that can have a significant effect on the quality of the product, as well as the safety of patients, particularly because of the increased risk of immune reactions [39]. The aggregation of the CCK-B scFv antibodies potentially reflects aspects related to the employed protein expression and refolding strategy. Large-scale production of scFvs in bacterial expression systems, although practical and time-efficient, often leads to a product containing aggregates [40]. This may be significantly boosted by the particular propensity of the designed scFv to aggregate. Our in silico analyses showed some aggregation hotspots within the lead CCK-B scFvs amino acid sequences, but also those lead scFvs with low aggregation potential. Furthermore, our computational approaches are suitable during early drug development to select lead scFv molecules with reduced risk of aggregation and optimal developability properties. Our exploratory in-silico analyses additionally provide mechanistic insights into the antigen\u2013antibody interaction. scFv77-2 was predicted to contact non-linear stretches within the CCK-B surface. In silico analysis of the putative scFv-CCK-B interface revealed that most of the antibody determinants involved in antigen recognition are located within the heavy-chain CDR1, heavy-chain CDR3, and the light-chain CDR1, whose residues are less prone to aggregation."

Large-scale production of scFvs in bacterial expression systems, although practical and time-efficient, often leads to a product containing aggregates [40]. This may be significantly boosted by the particular propensity of the designed scFv to aggregate. Our in silico analyses showed some aggregation hotspots within the lead CCK-B scFvs amino acid sequences, but also those lead scFvs with low aggregation potential. Furthermore, our computational approaches are suitable during early drug development to select lead scFv molecules with reduced risk of aggregation an optimal developability prop rties. Our exploratory in-silico analyses additionally provide mechanistic insights into the antigen\u2013antibody interaction. scFv77-2 was predicted to contact non-linear stretches within the CCK-B surface. In silico analysis of the putative scFv-CCK-B interface revealed that most of the antibody determinants involved in antigen recognition are located within the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11035 17 of 25\nheavy-chain CDR1, heavy-chain CDR3, and the light-chain CDR1, whose residues are less prone to aggregation."

            "text": "Thus, current treatment with analgesics even when combined with antidepressants and/or anticonvulsants are generally unsatisfactory in providing pain relief [41]. As an example of the unmet need, the current poor response rate to analgesics for painful trigeminal neuropathy among women for providing >50% reduction of pain intensity is only 11% [41]. The chronic pain experience exerts powerful persisting influences on the brain, inducing permanent circuitry alterations that diminish physical and mental function. Effective non-addictive, non-opioid therapeutics for chronic orofacial pain remain a critical need. Previously, a CCK octopeptide antagonist (CCK-8) was reported to suppress binding of naloxone to opioid receptors [42]. The study suggested the CCK-8 might be (1) suppressing opioid binding by uncoupling opioid receptors from their G-protein effectors pre-synaptically and (2) reducing the number and affinity of opioid receptors through a preventative post-receptor mechanism. Further development of the CCK-BR scFv will provide its relevance for use not only in regard to chronic neuropathic pain but its potential adjuvant use to reduce opiate dose and tolerance. CCK-BR is involved in several different aspects of the human pain experience that are particularly prominent in females [9]. CCKBR and its neuropeptide ligand, CCK, are widely expressed in sensory ganglia, spinal cord, and the brain pain circuitry [10,11]. Axotomy results in CCK upregulation in sensory neurons (30%) after 14 days [10]. A 4.7-fold upregulation of CCK-BR mRNA (p < 0.0001) is reported in a mouse sciatic nerve injury model [12]. Our microarray gene chip expression profile data identified >4-fold upregulation (p < 0.0001) of CCK-BR mRNA post day 3 in trigeminal ganglia (TG) compared to na\u00efves in our chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain model [13]. CCK-BR mRNA remained upregulated 2.72-fold (p < 0.001) on post day 21. In fact, CCKBR is contributory to chronic pain in a variety of animal models, with gene expression changes over time [10,14,15]. Engineered antibodies of this type feature binding activity similar to monoclonal antibodies but with stronger affinity and thus are suitable for in vivo models. The increased tissue penetrability due to their smaller size provides access to the peripheral nerve ganglia and the pain pathway sites centrally demonstrated with Western blots. More importantly, scFv antibodies have promising biotherapeutic applications for both nervous and immune systems, now recognized as interactive in chronic pain. The scFv antibodies have higher affinity, stability, solubility, and binding specificity for cholecystokinin B but not A receptor. The scFv optimized with the best binding affinity were selected for the in vivo and in vitro efficacy demonstrated in the studies presented. It is well known that cholecystokinin B receptor and its neuropeptide ligand are upregulated in chronic neuropathic pain and stress models. They are abundant throughout pain pathway sites."

Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11035 18 of 25\ncraniofacial neuropathic pain, FRICT-ION is the only model of trigeminal neuralgia since it is responsive to carbamazepine [43]. The reduction of hypersensitivity at 1 week prevents the development of many of the anxiety and depression measures tested here with the zero maze and the light/dark tests. Anxiety behaviors arise in the untreated mice with FRICTION at 4\u20136 weeks and continue through the 10-week study. The accompanying depression, tested with the sucrose splash test, follows a similar time course in the untreated mice with FRICT-ION. Many of the depression-like behaviors are ameliorated by the single dose CCK-BR scFv treatment. The diminished hypersensitivity prevents cognitive disruption seen in the mice with persisting hypersensitivity [31]. We have previously published results for the novel object cognitive measure mice with FRICT-ION that were significantly affected, while those receiving scFv 77-2 had results similar to na\u00efve mice [31]. Likewise, results for the conditioned place preference box demonstrated that lead CCK-BR scFv 77-2 has no abuse potential [31]. The startling factor about the treatment with the small ribosome generated scFv antibodies is that they are effective with only a single dose in this chronic craniofacial pain model. The recovery is durable in this and the chronic spared nerve injury model [31]. The effectiveness of the small non-opiate scFv antibody targeting the cholecystokinin B receptor (CCK-BR) alleviation of chronic orofacial hypersensitivity is sufficient to prevent development of anxiety and depression in the chronic model."

The data generated here agree with these findings and extend to DRG neurons as well. In addition, we show that LY225910, a commercially available CCK2 antagonist does not produce a statistically significant reduction in firing frequency in contrast to scFv 77-2. This is in agreement with in vivo findings that LY225910 needs to be administered daily for at least 1 week in order to produce an anti-allodynic effect, whereas only a single dose of scFv 77-2 is required. This also suggests that the acute effect on peripheral sensory neurons may be the differentiating factor that explains the mechanism of action of scFv 77-2\u2019s relief of pain in chronic models compared to pharmacologics such as LY225910. These findings support the use of single-chain Fragment variable antibodies generated with ribosome display technology as preferred non-opioid therapy to target and block the cholecystokinin B receptor in vivo and in vitro chronic neuropathic pain models.

Homology Modeling\nThe I-TASSER is a bioinformatics method for predicting 3D structure model of protein molecules from amino acid sequences [44\u201346,48]. The predicted structural models were validated using high-resolution protein structure refinement (Protein refinement module, Schrodinger-Prime module, Biologics suite, Schrodinger 2021-2) [49], ModRefiner [50], and fragment-guided molecular dynamics (FG-MD) simulation [51]. The protein and peptide were prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard tool included in Maestro (Schrodinger Suite 2022-4). Water molecules, co-factors of crystallization, and ligands were removed, missing atoms were added, side chains and loops were filled by Prime, and hydrogens were added with Epik module options provided in the protein preparations wizard at physiological pH. This final structure of the protein was minimized with the OPSL-3e force field as implemented in Maestro with an implicit solvent (water). The final minimized structure was used for docking purposes.\n4.3.2. Molecular Docking\nThe refined models were docked according to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)based program and PIPER [52]. The mouse scFv77-2-mouse CCK-B peptide docking were modeled using the PIPER protein\u2013protein docking program in the BioLuminate product [53,54]. The largest cluster size with minimal local energy and a near-native state of the protein conformation was chosen. Docking results were validated using the LigPlot tool of Schr\u00f6dinger suite 2022-4 or Ligplot+ v.2.2 software. An interactive map was studied to identify the chemical nature of the interactions such as hydrogen bonds, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction, side-chain bond, and backbone hydrogen bonds. Ligand\u2013protein interaction maps were also used to predict the position and interacting amino acids of the scFv77-2 and CCK-B peptide.\n4.3.3. Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations\nMD simulation studies for the selected docked poses were carried out by the Desmond module of Schr\u00f6dinger suite 2022-4 with OPLS4 force field [55]. The protein\u2013ligand complex was embedded in a predefined TIP3P water model in the orthorhombic box [56]. The box volume was minimized, and the overall system charge was neutralized by adding Na+ or Cl\u2212 ions and 0.15 mM NaCl to construct near-physiological conditions. The temperature and pressure were kept constant at 300 K and 1.01325 bar throughout the simulation using Nose-Hoover thermostat [57] and Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat [58] methods. The simulations were performed for >100 ns using NPgammaT ensembles for proteins and membranes ensemble considering the number of atoms, pressure, and timescale [59]. During simulations, long\u2013range electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle\u2013Mesh\u2013Ewald method [60] and the whole ensemble was constructed as a rigid body packing and relaxed gradually at 1.2 kilojoule of energy during the simulations [59]. The amino acid energy contributions that will be obtained from the prime molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculation was used in our study to elucidate the key amino acids predicted to be critical protein\u2013protein interaction."

Males and females were compared separately and together since there was no difference. This includes evoked and spontaneous behaviors that are relevant to the human condition and thus are better predictors of anti-allodynic, anxiety- and depression-like behavioral efficacy.\n4.6.1. Von Frey Fiber Assessment of Hypersensitivity\nAssessment of sensitivity on the snout was performed before nerve injury to determine baseline threshold and performed weekly after nerve injury, through 10 weeks. Hypersensitivity is assessed by reflexive withdrawal response time to mechanical stimulation on the snout with graded thin nylon von Frey filaments with defined bending forces (tensile strength) (Figures 3D,E, 4 and 5) [38,61\u201363]. A trial consisted of 5 applications of several selected mid-range von Frey filaments applied once every 3 to 4 s. If no positive response was evoked, the next stronger filament was applied. The mean occurrence of withdrawal events in each of the trials was expressed as the number of responses out of 5: 0 indicates no withdrawal and 5 indicates the maximum number of withdrawals. An arithmetic algorithm was used to convert the fiber strength into grams force 30 when three of five responses were evoked from a given fiber. Behavioral assessment of hypersensitivity continued through 10 weeks post model induction. Responses to decreased gram force compared to controls indicated decreased sensitivity threshold or \u201chypersensitivity\u201d.\n4.6.2. Cognition Dependent Anxiety-like and Depression-like Behavioral Tests\nEffectiveness of the CCK-BR scFv to anxiety- and depression-related behaviors are assessed using the light/dark box, elevated zero maze, and sucrose splash tests. Anxietyand depression-like behaviors are quantified prior to euthanasia in week 10 [38,64,65]. Computer-linked video recordings are used to quantify the behaviors.\n4.6.3. Light/Dark Place Preference Test\nThe light/dark box used to assess anxiety-related behaviors consists of two equally sized chambers, one darkened and one brightly illuminated. Collected variables in this twochamber test are (1) the time spent in each chamber, (2) the number of transitions between chambers, (3) the number of rearing events, (4) entry latency into the light chamber, and (5) latency of first re-entry (transition) back into the dark chamber. Anxiety-like behavior is significantly greater in neuropathic pain models that do not receive the parent CCKBR scFv (n = 6, * p < 0.05 ANOVA).\n4.6.4. Elevated Zero Maze\nThe elevated plus maze is a widely used test for measuring anxiety-like behavior, by determining a preference between a comparatively safe environment (closed arms) and a\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11035 21 of 25\nthreatening environment (open arms). In principle, the more \u201canxious\u201d the subjects are, the less likely they will explore a risky or threatening environment. Anxiety-like behavior in the elevated zero maze is determined by the (1) number of open and closed quadrant entries, (2) total open and closed area occupancy, and (3) by the number of exploratory rearing events. High anxiety states are directly related to open area avoidance.\n4.6.5. Sucrose Splash Test\nDepression-like behavior is validated with the sucrose splash test where measurement of decreased grooming behavior is a symptom of depression. Frequency, duration, and latency of grooming are scored (10 min) after spraying a 10% sucrose solution (~250 \u00b5L) on the base of the tail. Grooming time after sucrose splash test was increased significantly after scFvs 12 and 95 in an initial test (n = 6, * p < 0.05 ANOVA)."
