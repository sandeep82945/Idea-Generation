1. **Investigate the optimal timing of PEG ingestion for patients with specific medical conditions.** 

For example, patients with diabetes or kidney disease may have different PEG absorption and elimination rates, which could affect the optimal timing of ingestion.


2. **Compare the efficacy of different PEG formulations for small bowel preparation.** 

Different PEG formulations, such as PEG with electrolytes or PEG with flavoring agents, may have different effects on small bowel preparation quality and patient tolerability.


3. **Evaluate the role of other bowel preparation agents, such as sodium phosphate or sodium sulfate, in improving small bowel visibility.** 

These agents may be more effective or better tolerated than PEG in certain patients.


4. **Study the impact of PEG preparation timing on the detection of specific small bowel lesions, such as tumors or ulcers.** 

It is possible that the timing of PEG ingestion may affect the visibility of certain lesions, which could have implications for the diagnostic accuracy of SBCE.


5. **Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of different PEG preparation strategies for SBCE.** 

This would help to determine the most cost-effective approach to small bowel preparation, taking into account both the cost of the preparation agent and the cost of repeat examinations due to inadequate preparation.
