    "abstractText": "Three new triterpenoids\u2014spergulagenin B (1), spergulagenin C (2), and spergulagenin D (3)\u2014were isolated from the aerial part of Glinus oppositifolius, along with 17 known compounds (4\u201320). The structures of these new compounds were identified by spectroscopic and MS analyses. Compounds 3, 5, 19, and 20 were evaluated for inhibition of nitric oxide production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells with IC50 values of 17.03, 18.21, 16.30, and 12.64 \u03bcM, respectively. Compounds 3, 5, and 20 exhibited inhibitory effects on LPS-induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 cells with IC50 values of 18.35 \u00b1 1.34, 17.56 \u00b1 1.41, and 14.27 \u00b1 1.29 \u03bcM, respectively.",

(Figure 1) is an annual herb mainly distributed at low altitudes in the southern part of Taiwan [1]. G. oppositifolius is a folk herb used in the treatment of dermatitis and chronic inflammatory diseases [2]. Flavonoids [3,4], triterpenoids [4], naphthalenes [4], and their derivatives are widely distributed in plants of the family Molluginaceae. Many of these compounds exhibit anti-inflammatory [3,5], antifungal, antiparasitic, and antibacterial activities [6]. Macrophages are one of the immune cells that can secrete nitric oxide (NO), a mediator of inflammatory responses that can participate in host defense [7]. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is a cytokine with pleiotropic effects on a variety of cell types. It has been recognized as a master regulator of inflammatory responses and has a bearing on the pathogenesis of certain inflammatory diseases [8]. Inhibition of abnormal activation of macrophages by medicines has been proposed as a way to improve inflammatory diseases. G. oppositifolius was one of many species that we screened for the anti-inflammatory constituents of Formosan plants. Current phytochemical studies of G. oppositifoliu have led to the isolation of three new triterpenoids\u2014spergulagenin B (1), spergulagenin C (2),\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2903. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28072903 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2903 2 of 12\nand spergulagenin D (3)\u2014together with 17 known compounds.

Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra were recorded on a Chirascan CD\nspectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK).

Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra were recorded on a Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK). High resolution electron ionization mass spectrometry (HR-EI-MS) was measured at Chung Hsing University (Taichung, Taiwan). Ultraviolet (UV) spectra were measured using a Shimadzu Pharmaspec-1700 UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra\u2014including heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC), correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectrometry (NOESY) experiments\u2014were measured using a Bruker DRX-500 FT-NMR (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) operating at 125 MHz (13C) and 500 MHz (1H), respectively. Chemical shifts are given in ppm (\u03b4) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. HPLC separations were carried out utilizing a P230 HPLC system (NATIONAL ANALYTICAL CORPORATION, Maharashtra, India) equipped with P230 HPLC Pump and an IOTA 2 detector, utilizing ChromNav software (version 2.0, Jasco). TLC analysis was performed utilizing aluminum pre-coated Si plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

Spergulagenin B (1) was isolated as colorless needle with molecular formula C30H48O4 as confirmed by HR-EI-MS, showing an [M]+ ion at m/z 472.3549 (calcd. 472.3547) and supported by the 1H- and 13C-NMR data. The IR absorption bands implied the presence of OH (3423 cm\u22121) and acetyl group (1694 cm\u22121). The 1H- and 13C-NMR data of 1 showed the acetyl group [\u03b4H 2.23 (3H, s, H-30); \u03b4C 25.9 (C-30) and 217.2 (C-22)] and seven methyl signals [\u03b4H 0.96 (3H, s, H-25), 1.01 (3H, s, H-27), 1.03 (3H, s, H-23), 1.04 (3H, s, H-28), 1.07 (3H, s, H-26), 1.08 (3H, s, H-24) and 1.43 (3H, s, H-29); \u03b4C 15.6 (C-25), 16.6 (C-26), 17.2 (C-28), 18.7 (C-27), 21.1 (C-23), 21.2 (C-29) and 26.6 (C-24)]. Comparison of the 1H- and 13C-NMR data of 1 with those of spergulagenin A (1a) [6] suggested that their structures were closely related, except that the carbonyl group [\u03b4C 217.3 (C-3)] at C-3 of 1 replaced the 3\u03b2-hydoxyl group of spergulagenin A (1a) [6]. This was supported by both HMBC correlations between H-1, H-2, H-23 and C-3 (\u03b4C 217.3). The relative stereochemistry of 1 was elucidated on the basis of NOESY experiments (Figure 2). The NOESY cross-peaks between H-5/H-9, H-9/H-12, H-12/H-27, H-13/H-17, H-13/H-26, H-16/H-29, H-23/H-25, H-25/H-26, H-27/H-28, and, H-28/H-29 suggested that H-13, H-17, Me (23), Me (25) and Me (26) on the \u03b2-side and H-5, H-9, H-12, H-16, Me (27), Me (28) and Me (29) are on the \u03b1-side of 1.

The chemical structures of compounds 1\u201320.\nSpergulagenin B (1) was isolated as colorless needle with molecular formula C30H48O4 as confirmed by HR-EI-MS, showing an [M]+ ion at m/z 472.3549 (calcd. 472.3547) and supported by the 1H- and 13C-NMR data. The IR absorption bands implied the presence of OH (3423 cm\u22121) and acetyl group (1694 cm\u22121). The 1H- and 13C-NMR data of 1 showed the acetyl group [\u03b4H 2.23 (3H, s, H-30); \u03b4C 25.9 (C-30) and 217.2 (C-22)] and seven methyl signals [\u03b4H 0.96 (3H, s, H-25), 1.01 (3H, s, H-27), 1.03 (3H, s, H-23), 1.04 (3H, s, H-28), 1.07 (3H, s, H-26), 1.08 (3H, s, H-24) and 1.43 (3H, s, H-29); \u03b4C 15.6 (C-25), 16.6 (C-26), 17.2 (C-28), 18.7 (C-27), 21.1 (C-23), 21.2 (C-29) and 26.6 (C-24)]. Comparison of the 1H- and 13C-NMR data of 1 with those of spergulagenin A (1a) [6] suggested that their structures were closely related, except that the carbonyl group [\u03b4C 217.3 (C-3)] at C-3 of 1 replaced the 3\u03b2-hydoxyl group of spergulagenin A (1a) [6]. This was supported by both HMBC correlations between H-1, H-2, H-23 and C-3 (\u03b4C 217.3). The relative stereochemistry of 1 was elucidated on the basis of NOESY experiments (Figure 2). The NOESY cross-peaks between H-5/H9, H-9/H-12, H-12/H-27, H-13/H-17, H-13/H-26, H-16/H-29, H-23/H-25, H-25/H-26, H27/H-28, and, H-28/H-29 suggested that H-13, H-17, Me (23), Me (25) and Me (26) on the \u03b2-side and H-5, H-9, H-12, H-16, Me (27), Me (28) and Me (29) are on the \u03b1-side of 1.

The structures of these new compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectral data. The effects on macrophage pro-inflammatory responses of isolated compounds were evaluated by suppressing LPS-induced NO generation by macrophage RAW264.7 cells. The results of anti-inflammatory assays show that compounds 3, 5, 19, and 20 can obviously inhibit LPS-induced NO generation. Trans-ferulic acid (20) is the most effective among the isolated compounds, with IC50 value of 12.64 \u00b1 1.14 \u00b5M, against LPS-induced NO generation.
