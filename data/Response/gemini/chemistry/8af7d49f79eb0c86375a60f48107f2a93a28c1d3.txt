1. **Investigate the effect of different types of fly ash on CO2 adsorption capacity.** The study only used fly ash from a single coal power plant, but it is possible that fly ash from different sources may have different properties that could affect CO2 adsorption capacity.
2. **Optimize the synthesis conditions of the FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel to improve CO2 adsorption capacity.** The study used a specific set of synthesis conditions, but it is possible that different conditions could lead to a higher CO2 adsorption capacity.
3. **Investigate the long-term stability of the FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel under CO2 adsorption conditions.** The study did not investigate the long-term stability of the hydrogel, but it is important to know how the hydrogel will perform over time in order to assess its potential for commercial applications.
4. **Explore the use of the FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel for CO2 capture from other sources, such as industrial flue gases.** The study only investigated the use of the hydrogel for CO2 capture from a simulated flue gas, but it is possible that the hydrogel could also be used for CO2 capture from other sources.
5. **Develop a pilot-scale CO2 capture system using the FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel.** The study only investigated the use of the hydrogel in a laboratory-scale system, but it is important to develop a pilot-scale system to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology for commercial applications.
