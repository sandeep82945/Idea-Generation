    "abstractText": "Four undescribed pyranone derivatives, named ascomycopyrones A\u2013D (1\u20134), as well as one known analogue simplicilopyrone (5) (this is the first study to report the absolute configuration), were isolated from the endophytic fungus Ascomycota sp. FAE17 derived from the flowers of Scutellaria formosa. The structures of these pyranones were identified by comprehensive spectroscopic and MS analyses, and the absolute configurations were determined by their experimental and quantum chemical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. All isolated compounds were tested for various bioactivities, including antibacterial, cytotoxic activity, and NO inhibitory activity. Unfortunately, none of the compounds showed significant bioactivities.",

            "text": "Endophytic fungi are a promising and important source of novel and bioactive natural products [1\u20134]. A range of bioactive specialized metabolites have been reported from plant endophytic fungi, including polycyclic beticolin, emestrin, isoindoline alkaloid xylarin A, diketopiperazine alkaloids phaeosphaones A\u2013D, and ansamacrolactams catellatolactams A\u2013C [5\u201310]. It has been suggested that plant endophytic fungi could produce bioactive compounds of plant origin in a sustainable way, thus indicating the need for further research in this context. Scutellaria formosa belongs to the genus Scutellaria of the family Labiatae (Lamiaceae), which is a very rare perennial herb mainly distributed in Hainan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and other regions of China. It mostly grows in special areas with humid soil in the shade of forests at an altitude of 450\u2013550 m in southern Hainan [11]. Previous phytochemical investigations of the plant led to the identification of several neo-clerodane diterpenoids and flavonoids, which revealed in vitro cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines, anti-inflammatory properties, and inhibitory effects against HIV lytic replication [11\u201314]. However, information on the constituents and bioactivity of the secondary metabolites of endophytic fungus from S. formosa is lacking. So far, about 36 compounds have been isolated and identified from Ascomycota sp., which have been evaluated as antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, with significant inhibition effects against \u03b1-glucosidase and antioxidatives [15\u201319]. In the course of further development and utilization of the pharmaceutical plant source of S. formosa, our previous investigation on endophytic fungi from this plant resulted in the discovery of several types of new compounds [20]. In this study, we investigated the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5388. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28145388 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5388 2 of 12\nendophytic fungus Ascomycota sp.

Its 1H and 13C NMR spectrum data (Table 2) revealed the same 4-methoxy-2H-pyran-2-one moiety and 2-substituted 1-hydroxypropyl group as found in 1. In addition, NMR resonances for two methyls [\u03b4C/\u03b4H 22.6/1.08 (3H, d, J = 6.4 Hz), 18.0/0.96 (3H, d, J = 7.2 Hz)], one oxygenated methylene [\u03b4C/\u03b4H 69.2/3.90 (1H, t, J = 8.8 Hz)/3.66 (1H, t, J = 8.8 Hz)], two methines [\u03b4C/\u03b4H 53.9/1.59 (1H, qd, J = 8.0, 6.0 Hz), 42.0/.80 (1H, td, J = 6.8, 2.4 Hz)], two oxygenated methines [\u03b4C/\u03b4H 110.8/4.58 (1H, d, J = 2.4 Hz), 67.4/3.54 (1H, t, J = 6.8 Hz)] were observed in the spectra of 3. The other partial structural fragments were determined by 2D NMR data, including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC experiments. From the 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Figure 2), it was possible to establish the proton sequence from H-2\u2032 (\u03b4H 4.58) to H-6\u2032 (\u03b4H 0.97) to H-4\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.59) through H-3\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.80); H-5\u2032 (\u03b4H 3.90/3.66) to H-7\u2032 (\u03b4H 3.54) through H-4\u2032 (\u03b4H1.59); and H-7\u2032 (\u03b4H 3.54) to H-8\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.07). The presence of 3\u2032-methyl-4\u2032-ethoxy furan moiety was determined on the basis of the key HMBC correlations (Figure 2) from H-6\u2032 (\u03b4H 0.97) to C-2\u2032 (\u03b4C 110.8), C-3\u2032 (\u03b4C 42.0) and C-4\u2032 (\u03b4C 53.9), H-8\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.07) to C-7\u2032 (\u03b4C 67.4) and C-4\u2032 (\u03b4C 53.9). The above HMBC correlations also confirmed the linkages established by the COSY experiment. Moreover, the location of the moiety was positioned at C-9 through the ether bond by the crucial HMBC correlation from H-2\u2032 (\u03b4H 4.58) to C-9 (\u03b4C 69.8). From these data, the planar structure of 3 was proposed. The relative configuration of 3 was elucidated from NOESY data (Figure 3). A NOESY correlation between H-5 (\u03b4H 2.44) and H-10 (\u03b4H 0.89) placed these protons on the same face. The relative configurations of H-2\u2032, 3\u2032, 4\u2032, 7\u2032 in the furan moiety was elucidated to be trans in H-2\u2032 and H-4\u2032, cis in H-3\u2032, H-4\u2032, and H-7\u2032 on the basis of the NOESY correlations of H-6\u2032/H-2\u2032/H-4\u2032and H-3\u2032/H-7\u2032.

The absolute configuration of C-5, 8 was determined\nFigure 6. The DP4+ calculations for compound 2.\nCompound 4 was obtained as a colorless oil. The HRESIMS of 4 exhibited a [M + Na]+\npeak at m/z 337.1604 and established a molecular formula of C16H26O6, implying four degrees of unsaturation. Comparison of the NMR spectroscopic data (Table 2) with those obtained for 3 showed that 4 was also a 4-methoxy-2H-pyran-2-one analogue of 3. This significant difference could be explained by the formation of the 2\u2032,3\u2032,4\u2032-substituent in 4. This explanation was further supported by the COSY correlation (Figure 2) between H-7\u2032, H-3\u2032, and H-4\u2032, H-5\u2032, H-4\u2032, and H-8\u2032, and the HMBC correlations (Figure 2) from H-5\u2032 to C-2\u2032, H-8\u2032 to C-5\u2032 and C-3\u2032, H-7\u2032 to C-2\u2032, and C-4\u2032, H-6\u2032 to C-2\u2032, which led to a 2\u2032,4\u2032-dimethyl4\u2032-methylol furan moiety. In the NOESY spectrum (Figur 3), the NOE correlation from H-5 to Me-10 was observed, which suggested that the configuration should be 5R*, 8R*. The configurations of H-2\u2032, H-3\u2032, and H-4\u2032 were determined as cis by the NOESY correlations of H-3\u2032/H-6\u2032 and H-8\u2032/H-6\u2032. The absolute configurations of C-5 and C-8 were proposed as 5R and 8R on the basis of CD data, which were in good agreement with the CD data (Figure 4) of compound 4. Consequently, the structure of 4 was deduced and named as ascomycopyrone D. The known compound was identified as simplicilopyrone (5) (Figure 1) by comparing the spectroscopic data with that reported in the literature [22].

Density value (OD) was processed with the data at a wavelength of 570 nm, and the inhibition rate was calculated according to the formula: inhibition rate (%) = [1 \u2212 (OD sample/OD control)] \u00d7 100%. The positive controls were doxorubicin for MCF-7, A549, and Hela cells (the respective inhibition rates were 93.25%, 95.42%, and 92.16%).\n3.4.3. NO Inhibitory Activity\nThe cytotoxicity against RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by MTT method [26]. Concisely, 96-well plates containing cells at a density of 8 \u00d7 104 cells/well were incubated at 37 \u25e6C. NO content of the supernatant was checked by Griess reagent, similar to the previous publication [29]. In brief, RAW264.7 cells in a 96-well plate (2 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were incubated overnight. Cells were treated with different concentrations of samples (1 h) first, then incubated with LPS (2 \u00b5g/mL) for 24 h. After incubation, the cell supernatant (50 \u00b5L) was transferred to another 96-well plate and commingled with Griess reagent (v/v, 1:1) for 10 min incubation at an indoor temperature. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. NO production in the supernatant was assessed by Griess reagent. Dexamethasone served as a positive control. NO levels were tested by nitrite using the Griess reaction. The nitrite concentration was calculated from the standard curve. We diluted 1 mM NaNO2 in standard solution to gain the final concentrations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 100 \u00b5M and added 50.0 \u00b5L to a 96-well plate. Then, 50.0 \u00b5L of Griess reagent was added for 10 min at 37 \u25e6C. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm. We then used DRAW to create a standard curve with concentration and absorbance as abscissa and ordinate, respectively."

            "text": "In this study, four previously undescribed pyranone derivatives, named ascomycopyrones A\u2013D (1\u20134), as well as one known analogue simplicilopyrone (5), were isolated from the endophytic fungus Ascomycota sp. FAE17 derived from the flowers of S. formosa. The structures of these pyranones with absolute configurations were determined unambiguously by NMR spectroscopic data analysis and quantum chemical calculations. Compounds 1\u20135 were tested for antibacterial, cytotoxic activity, and NO inhibitory activity. The results showed that all isolates exhibited weak antibacterial activity (MIC values all over 64 \u00b5g/mL) against E. coli, S. aureus, E. faecalis, and S. maltophilia, without significant activity against MCF-7, A549, and Hela cells at the maximum tested concentration of 100 \u00b5M and showed no significant inhibitory activity against NO production at the concentration of 50 \u00b5M.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28145388/s1, Figures S1\u2013S32: 1D, 2D NMR spectra and HR-ESI-MS of compounds 1\u20134.\nAuthor Contributions: J.Y. performed the experiments for the isolation and structure elucidation and prepared the manuscript; J.Y. and Z.C. contributed to the antibacterial, NO inhibitory activity, and cytotoxic activity; Z.S. contributed to part of the structure determination; G.C., X.S., and C.H. conceived, designed, and authored the article; Y.H. reviewed and edited; W.C. supervised the research and revised the manuscript.
