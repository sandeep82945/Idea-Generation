    "abstractText": "There is a widely recognized need to reduce human activity's impact on the environment. Many industries of the leather and textile sector (LTI), being aware of producing a significant amount of residues (Ke\u00dfler et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2021), are adopting measures to reduce the impact of their processes on the environment, starting with a more comprehensive characterization of the chemical risk associated with the substances commonly used in LTI. The present work contributes to these efforts by compiling and toxicologically annotating the substances used in LTI, supporting a continuous learning strategy for characterizing their chemical safety. This strategy combines data collection from public sources, experimental methods and in silico predictions for characterizing four different endpoints: CMR, ED, PBT, and vPvB. We present the results of a prospective validation exercise in which we confirm that in silico methods can produce reasonably good hazard estimations and fill knowledge gaps in the LTI chemical space. The proposed protocol can speed the process and optimize the use of resources including the lives of experimental animals, contributing to identifying potentially harmful substances and their possible replacement by safer alternatives, thus reducing the environmental footprint and impact on human health.",

In the leather and textile industry (LTI), this change will require a large effort for the comprehensive identification of substances used in the manufacture and the detailed characterization of the toxicological risk associated with each one. At the European level, there are ongoing efforts to define a new chemical strategy (CS)(Conto 2021), in which there is an active participation of the different industrial sectors concerned, such is the case of LTI.\nWith respect to the first step, a full catalogue of the substances used in LTI has not been completed. Efforts have been made by the Chemsec Textile Guide (2022), compiled by the NGO Chemsec, but it only includes a small number of all the substances used in the LTI. The number of substances used in this industry has been estimated to be 10,000\n* Manuel Pastor manuel.pastor@upf.edu\n1 Department of\u00a0Medicine and\u00a0Life Sciences, Research Programme on\u00a0Biomedical Informatics (GRIB), Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain\n2 Department of\u00a0Pharmacology, Pharmacy and\u00a0Pharmaceutical Technology, Innopharma Drug Screening and\u00a0Pharmacogenomics Platform.

From processing natural fibres to the synthesis of polymers, from the dyeing of fabrics to the tanning of leather, many steps involved in clothes manufacturing use thousands of chemical substances. In our globalized world, it is common that manufacturing steps are carried out in distant parts of the globe by providers of fibres, fabrics, dyes, or leather with different degrees of control on the substances involved in their process.\nRegarding the characterization of the chemical risk associated with the use of these substances, in many cases, their toxicological information is not complete (Hartung 2009a, b). This does not mean that the industry is not complying with all legislation applicable to its activity, but moving towards a more responsible manufacturing process should go beyond current legal requirements with the aim of identifying potentially harmful substances and progressing in their replacement by safer alternatives.\nEven assuming a very conservative estimate, the number of substances used in LTI that are not fully evaluated from a toxicological point of view can amount to more than 10,000 (Drumond Chequer et\u00a0al. 2013; Ke\u00dfler et\u00a0al. 2021; Liu et\u00a0al. 2021). A complete chemical risk evaluation of every substance would require an enormous investment of time and money. Furthermore, and despite the commitment of the European Union to the Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of testing on animals (Directive 2010/63/EU), if such evaluation is carried out using currently accepted methodologies, it will require an ethically unacceptable number of in\u00a0vivo experiments.\nFor this reason, we consider that any strategy for improving the characterization of the chemical risk of these substances must make efficient use of existing knowledge and apply, as much as possible, new approach methodologies (NAM). In particular, in silico methods offer the possibility to characterize relevant endpoints with little investment of time and money and they can be applied to a large fraction of the uncharacterized substances used in the LTI to obtain useful estimations of their toxicological properties.\nIn the present manuscript, we report the first results of a project funded by Inditex, one of the leaders of the LTI, aiming to design a long-time strategy for the characterization of the chemical hazard of substances used in LTI. The ultimate goals of this project are aligned with the Roadmap to Zero (ZDHC, https:// www. roadm aptoz ero. com).\nThe key aspects of this project are the following:\n\u2022 Compilation of a comprehensive catalogue of substances used in LTI. \u2022 Annotation of the compounds in this catalogue with relevant toxicological information extracted from public sources.\n\u2022 Use existing knowledge to fill data gaps by applying computational modelling methods. \u2022 Prospective validation of the annotations and predictions using experimental techniques (most of them approved by OECD). \u2022 Development and implementation of a strategy for the continuous and automatic updating of the LTI-DB.\nIn a first stage, the chemical risk assessment has been focused on a set of highly relevant toxicological endpoints. With respect to the human health effects, we studied liabilities represented by CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic, and reprotoxic compounds) and ER (endocrine disruptors) labelling. With respect to ecotoxicity, we focused on the PBT (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) and the vPvB (very persistent and very bioaccumulative) labelling.\nThe project started in 2019, and so far, we have been able to compile a database containing safety information for more than 4634 compounds from 12 open access data sources. Integrated annotations for the four considered endpoints were obtained using decision workflows. Missing annotations were partially covered using ad hoc developed in silico models, allowing to predict about 6.483 properties not extracted from the data sources. These predictions were validated by testing their agreement with newly performed experimental results for 32 compounds, carefully selected to represent different reliability scenarios.\nThe preliminary results, which will be described in detail in the following sections, are only the first step of a longterm strategy, since we plan to keep collecting and curating data, improving our data extraction workflows and maintaining the in silico models to generate predictions of growing quality."

The chemical information was handled using RDKit (Landrum 2006) version 2019.03.1. Two different databases were generated: Reference Compounds (Compuestos de Referencia, CR) and Compounds of Interest for Inditex (Compuestos de Inter\u00e9s para Inditex, CII). Both stemmed from generic PostgreSQL databases designed to host chemical compounds with biological annotations previously developed in our group. In the case of CR, we used the original schema, while for CII the schema was edited to accommodate the information from the legacy data table. These data were\n1 3\nimported into CII using an ad hoc Python script (https:// github. com/ phi- grib/ Itex_ codes/ tree/ master/ Creat eDB).\nWhen confronted with the problem of generating unique identifiers for all the substances, we decided to use the CAS-RN as the primary database index. This has the advantage of being commonly used in the toxicology field and the related legislation, as well as being accessible for all compounds (no unpublished compounds are referenced). Alternatives based on the chemical structure (e.g. InChi and InChiKey) were tested and considered unsuitable for this use since no chemical structure can be identified for a large portion of the substances of interest (mixtures, extracts, proprietary substances)."

ECHA and Pharos are the main sources of annotations, while PubChem is mainly used for obtaining structures from CAS-RN codes when they are not available from alternative sources. The substances collected in our database had hazard annotations obtained from different data sources (Table\u00a01). Initially, only hazard annotations from ECHA and all its subcategories (REACH, CLP\u2026) were included, but Pharos hazard annotations were included in the later versions.\nCII database started incorporating an initial set of 3464 substances that belonged to the LTI space. To enlarge this collection, we retrieved compounds and analysed their functional data from diverse sources: associated REACH descriptors were retrieved from the ECHA database, and descriptive unstructured texts were retrieved from the ECHA and Pharos databases. To get the final list of compounds identified as \"used in the leather and textile industry\", we selected all substances with at least one REACH descriptor that indicated a high probability of a substance being used in LTI.\nDatabase hazard annotation update\nAnnotations were obtained from the different ECHA subcategories and introduced in CII. Also, hazard annotations were retrieved from Pharos with an ad hoc crawler and inserted in CII. This process resulted in the addition of 1531 ECHA annotations and 563 Pharos hazard annotations.

The annotations obtained from this workflow results were stored in CII.\nThis workflow is depicted in Figure S1, but in a few words, it starts checking ECHA. If the hazard annotations are found under CLP, REACH, and SVHC, a YES is assigned for that given endpoint. Pending is assigned if the annotation is found in other sources like the Registration dossier. Finally, when no hazard annotation is detected, No Information is assigned. Then, our CR database is checked for any annotation that we could have missed and added to CII. The final step was to check in Pharos the hazard annotations for these endpoints, simply translating positives as YES and negatives as NO. If no hazard annotation is found, the compound is annotated as No Information.\nSince we are using different sources, we prioritised the ECHA hazard annotations and the positive ones (YES) in the case of inconsistencies. This is a conservative approach, meaning that any positive hazard annotation in an ECHA source was considered enough to annotate the substance as positive for this endpoint."

Annotations were all qualitative (YES, NO, No Information). Only compounds with YES (coded as 1) or NO (coded as 0) were used for the modelling.\nIn the case of CMR, Pending was considered positive (YES) as well. We followed a conservative approach: if something could be CMR, we took it as CMR. Substances in the No Information category were not used for model building, only for prediction. Problematic structures, including organometallics, inorganic compounds, or salts, were removed.\nIn most cases, the datasets extracted using this method were highly imbalanced, with many more positive than negative compounds. This is a well-studied problem that affects the quality and predictive performance of predictive models (Stewart, 2020). Imbalance correction algorithms (Lema\u00eetre et\u00a0al. 2017) were applied to mitigate its effect. When this protocol successfully obtains a reasonably balanced dataset, a classifier is used to build a qualitative QSAR model, as explained in the QSAR modelling section. Otherwise, when the number of compounds present in one class was too small, we used read-across (RAX) as a last resource.\nThe datasets obtained were the following:\n\u2013 PBT and vPvB sets: We generated training sets, applying oversampling to the positive class. These sets contained only annotated compounds from CII (YES and NO). The prediction sets contained all the compounds of the database with the problematic structures removed. The number of substances for each class is in Table\u00a02. \u2013 CMR set: No imbalance correction algorithm produced a model of enough quality in this case. To obtain wellbalanced datasets, while preserving all the information in\n1 3\nthe original data, three different balanced datasets were generated by including all negative compounds and a randomly selected sample of positive compounds of the same size. At the end, all the positives were included in at least one of the datasets. These series were used to build separate models, which were then combined in an ensemble model, as described in the QSAR modelling section. The prediction set again contained all the compounds without the problematic structures. Table\u00a02 contains the number of substances for each set and the class proportions. \u2013 ED set: In this case, the number of negative compounds (only three) was too low to attempt any unbalance correction. As a contingency solution, we applied a RAX analogue approach, as described in the RAX section. The number of positive compounds is shown in Table\u00a03."

The model building was carried out using the open-source modelling framework Flame (Pastor et\u00a0al. 2020). In our analyses, we found that the model quality improvement obtained by RF hyperparameter optimization was not significant. Therefore, to obtain comparable results, we applied the settings shown in Table\u00a0S1 to all the models. Since these models were conformal, the prediction consists of a couple of binary results indicating if the query compound belongs to class-0 (negative) or class-1 (positive). These are typically interpreted as positive when the compound belongs only to class-1, negative when it belongs only to class-0, and uncertain for compounds that belong to either both classes or neither.\nThe use of a conformal classifier allows considering prediction uncertainty (Svensson et\u00a0al. 2018). At model building, the user is requested to introduce a significance level (e.g. 0.8). This value is used to assign the prediction to the classes mentioned above (positive, negative), guaranteeing that, as a maximum, 20% of misclassifications will be produced. The significance level can be varied depending on the situation where the model is to be applied, and the consequences of such changes are readily understandable (Norinder et\u00a0al. 2014). For example, setting a high value of significance would reduce\nthe uncertainty of the predictions, with the inconvenience that more predictions would be considered uncertain."

To do so, we prepared several balanced datasets from the original CMR dataset, as described in the data preparation section. These were used to build individual classifiers using conformal RF. The ensemble model combines the results of these three models using a 'majority voting' approach. This means that query compounds were predicted using the three different models. The prediction results were then combined by counting the class-0 and class-1 predictions provided by the individual models. The final prediction is positive if the number of class-1 results is higher than the number of class0, negative if the number of class-0 results is higher than the number of class-1, and uncertain if both numbers are similar.\nAfter the models were created, these were applied to the non-informed compounds to obtain predicted values. It should be noted that thanks to the use of the conformal framework, every qualitative prediction is guaranteed to be correct with a certain degree of confidence (in this case, 80%) (Norinder et\u00a0al. 2014)."

To avoid the use of animals and to assay reproductive toxicity in a relevant 'non-animal' model adhering to the 3Rs rule, we used zebrafish embryos up to 120 hpf. Up to this developmental stage, the embryos are not considered animals according to European legislation (Sellick 2011). When they reach the stage of independent feeding, zebrafish embryos become subject to regulations for animal experimentation. We performed a set of previously described experiments to cover a wide range of potential reprotoxic effects, including teratocarcinogenesis, developmental neurotoxicity, and endocrine disruption.\nZebrafish embryos obtained and maintained as described previously for toxicity determination were used to determine (I) terato-carcinogenesis assayed as previously informed (Selderslaghs et\u00a0 al. 2009, 2012) with modifications. In brief, embryos were incubated for 0 hpf up to 120 hpf in the presence and absence of tested compounds. Each condition was assayed in triplicate with 12 embryos per condition per replicate. The appearance of selected characteristics and malformations with respect to normal development were quantified for the eyes, otoliths, heart, circulation, hatching, skeletal deformities, and body position. For each concentration tested, we assessed the mortality and the presence of malformations at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hpf using a light microscope. When possible, the lethal effects (LC50) and terato-carcinogenic effects (EC50) were determined using the ToxRat software. Based on these values, a teratogenic index (TI) was calculated as LC50/EC50. Based on previous studies, we considered a compound to be a teratogen when TI > 2 at 120 hpf. When no TI could be calculated due to no malformations induction to a degree extensive enough to calculate the EC50 in the presence of high toxicity, the compound was considered a non-teratogen. (II) Neurotoxicity was assayed by evaluating the locomotor activity in embryos exposed to the tested compounds from 0 to 120 hpf using Zebrabox and Zebralab (ViewPoint). We tested three concentrations (24 embryos per concentration) below the NOEC to avoid readily toxic concentrations. After incubation with tested compounds for 120 hs in 96-well plates, the activity of larvae in response to transitions from dark to light was evaluated. The protocol involved an initial 10\u00a0min acclimation period inside the Zebrabox, followed by three cycles of light\u2013dark of 10\u00a0min each. After the end of each cycle, the integrated activity of each embryo was registered. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA, followed by the Tukey post hoc test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Dead embryos were not considered in the analysis. (III) The endocrine-disrupting effect in zebrafish embryos was assayed by real-time PCR as previously reported (Jarque et\u00a0al. 2019) with modifications. In brief, 0 hpf embryos (12 embryos per condition in triplicate) were incubated with selected compounds for up to 120 hpf. After incubation,\ntreated (embryos incubated at the concentration right below the NOEC) and control embryos were collected in RNA later and kept at \u2212\u00a020\u00b0C until use. RNA was extracted from the samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and was followed by cDNA synthesis using random primers and the AffinityScript Multi Temperature cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). Finally, real-time PCR was performed for eight target genes to obtain data on the estrogenic (cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1: cyp19a1b, and vitellogenin: vtg1), androgenic (cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily W member 1: cyp2k22, and cytosolic sulphotransferase 3: sult2st3), and thyroid hormone (thyroid peroxidase: tpo, thyroid hormone receptor alpha: tra, transthyretin: ttr, and iodothyronine deiodinase 2: dio2) effect of the tested compounds. Significant changes in gene expression between controls and treated samples were considered as a potential endocrine-disrupting effect.\nA compound was considered as toxic for reproduction when positive for any of the three previously described experiments."

Then we select the top ten and the lowest ten because we want to stress test the reliability of our predictions and thus see if they reproduce the experimental results, even in unfavourable scenarios (lowest confidence predictions). Our expectations were that once ranked by their confidence, the experimental validation should be correct for the top ten, while for the lower ten we expect worse results. We did this selection twice, one for the positive predictions and another for the negative ones. The final result was a list with 20 positive and 20 negative compounds for each endpoint.\nFinally, this list of candidate compounds was reduced by removing compounds difficult to obtain from commercial providers or with physicochemical properties that make them unsuitable for the experimental procedure. The final list of compounds that were tested experimentally can be seen in Table\u00a04 (CMR), Table\u00a05 (PBT), and Table\u00a06 (ED).\n1 3"

The number of these substances has been estimated in the order of 10,000 and about 3000 are commonly used (Roy Choudhury 2014), as mentioned in \u201cIntroduction\u201d. To obtain a\nsignificant coverage of this chemical space, our database must incorporate at least this dimension.\nOur project started in early 2019 by identifying substances used in LTI, as described in the Materials and methods section, and compiling available toxicological information for four selected endpoints (CMR, ED, PBT, and vPvB) from open access data sources. Compounds and toxicological information were stored in two databases: one specifically oriented to collect LTI compounds, annotated with experimental and predicted data, and another, more generic, used mainly to support the annotation assignment. A decision workflow was used to label every compound in the database as positive, negative, or No Information for the four considered endpoints using the annotations from the external sources, as described in the Materials and\u00a0methods section. These databases were at the centre of a data collection, curation, and maintenance\n1 3\nstrategy involving other tools. In the Materials and methods section, we describe the details of the database development, update, and chemical structure curation.\nIn this period, new data sources were investigated, and some of them were included in the database updating protocol, resulting in a wider database with more annotations. This database updating protocol was run every three months, producing a new version of the database. The head version is then used in production, replacing previous versions which are stored only in compressed format.\nAt present (October 2020), the CII database contains 4634 substances with their hazards and endpoint annotations and regulations. The number of substances and annotations is detailed in Table\u00a07. The endpoint annotations for CII are not completed for the vast majority of the entries. 4579 out of 4634 substances were not informed for one or more of the four considered endpoints. This is approximately 99% (98.81%). From a total of 18,536 possible annotations (4 endpoints for each compound), 15,661 are 'No Information'. Thus, around 84% (84.49%) of the annotations are missing."

            "text": "After collecting all available data from the selected data sources, many compounds still lack information for one or several of the considered endpoints. The next step was to fill existing knowledge gaps by using in silico prediction methods. In our strategy, the prediction results were considered provisional annotations, with an approximate value in the absence of experimental data. In the database, predicted annotations were kept separate from the experimental ones.\nIn silico prediction methods are NAM methodologies that use existing toxicological knowledge to infer the properties of the uninformed compounds. Details about how these methods were built are provided in the Materials and methods section. The first challenge we faced in this task was the extremely unbalanced distribution of positive and negative annotations for all the considered endpoints in the CII database. Unbalanced datasets are difficult to handle by most machine learning methods (Stewart 2020). Diverse\napproaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue. In this project, we compared two different algorithms to correct the class imbalance: simple oversampling (doubling the less populated class) and subsampling (data not shown). We decided to go on with the simple oversampling since it produces models of better predictive quality without losing information about the chemical space under study. For some endpoints (PBT and vPvB), the application of this method generates training series with a reasonable balance between positive and negative compounds (see Table\u00a02). These were used to build classifier models of rather good quality, suitable for predicting the properties of uninformed compounds (see Table\u00a08).\nUnfortunately, this algorithm failed to produce adequately balanced datasets for the CMR endpoint. In this case, we generated three balanced datasets (see Materials and methods section) combined using a model ensemble of three classifiers. The sizes and positive/negative ratio of the three datasets are shown in Table\u00a02 and the quality of the ensemble model in Table\u00a08.\nThe best models obtained were used to predict uninformed compounds. The total amount of substances in the DB is 4634, but only 4293 have a structure. After removing problematic structures, we retained 3412. A total of 1222 substances, 881 with an untreatable structure and 341 without any structure, had to be processed using other methods, like a rule-based approach.\nFor making the prediction, 100 substances had to be discarded because they were not correctly processed by our modelling software (Flame). This led us to a total of 3312 substances.\nHere, we summarize the results obtained when we applied these models for each of the considered endpoints. Further details can be found in the Materials and methods section."

Regarding the substances already annotated in CII, this exercise allows to categorize 1196 non-informed substances, from which 691 (57.8%) were positive and 505 (42.2%) negative. If we focus our attention only on high-confidence predictions (confidence equal or higher to 80%), the model will identify only 122 new annotations (3.7% of the original 3312 predictions), 119 positives and 3 negatives. After the prediction, the total number of positive substances increased from 1401 to 2092 and the total number of negatives from 477 to 982.

Also, we made sure that these\n1 3\nseries include both highly reliable and less reliable predictions, as estimated by the conformal classifiers (see Materials and methods section for further details).\nThe compounds were selected as explained in the Method section. The substances were acquired from commercial providers and evaluated experimentally using the best methods available in our team for reproducing the predicted annotations. Some compounds were not tested due to availability issues or physicochemical properties.\nBefore discussing the results of this validation exercise, the experimental methods are summarized here (see the Materials and methods section for a more detailed description). No suitable experimental method was available for the vPvB endpoint, and therefore the experimental validation of our vPvB predictions is pending. Also, it should be noted that the in\u00a0vitro methods are only an\napproximation to the endpoint evaluation, and some of them do not cover all possible mechanisms. For example, for ED validation we selected in\u00a0vitro methods for detecting interactions with the androgen and oestrogen receptors, the main receptors involved in reproduction, but there are other molecular mechanisms that can lead to endocrine disruption in\u00a0vivo if they are altered by a xenobiotic compound. This fact should be considered in the interpretation of the results, in the sense that a positive in our experimental assays can be interpreted as a positive annotation, but a negative result should not be interpreted as a negative annotation since the compound can still be positive due to a mechanism not well covered by our test. In other words, our battery of tests can be considered specific, but not too sensible.\n1 3"

In the transformation assay, the incubation of compounds with two different treatment schedules allowed to identify the initiating or promoting carcinogenic potential of the compounds. Three of the tested compounds showed a statistically significant increase in the foci frequency when compared to the vehicle-treated cells at least in two sequential concentrations of the five different concentrations evaluated and were considered potential carcinogenic compounds according to the OECD guideline. The concentrations were selected on the basis of a dose-finding assay measuring compound cytotoxicity as suggested by Sasaki et\u00a0al (2014, 2015).\nNone of the tested compounds showed a significant increase in micronuclei formation at any of the three concentrations evaluated at the different treatment schedules (6\u00a0h with or without metabolic activation or 24\u00a0h without metabolic activation). Therefore, the CMR safety warning of the compounds was based on the carcinogenic and reprotoxic effects only.\nReprotoxicity was assessed using three methodologies, teratogenic effect, neurotoxicity, and endocrine-disrupting effect, as pointed out in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d. A compound was considered reprotoxic if it was proved positive in any of the assays. None of the compounds analysed showed terato-carcinogenic effect.

As a maximum, it will indicate the presence of compounds highly similar to positive ones that will be assigned a positive value. We selected a set of compounds\n1 3\nthat included four positive annotated compounds and eight non-informed compounds that were not similar to any positive compounds. Also, the experimental group analysed the endocrine-disrupting activity for the CMR compounds. As it can be seen in Table\u00a011, the positive compounds assignment was in agreement with experimental results for two of them (phenantrene and 2,3,5-triclorophenol) and in disagreement for the other two (nonafluorovaleric acid and 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene). Before considering these two last results as a false positive, we must note that the experimental methods used to assess ED were not comprehensive and focused only on AR and ER receptors. The endocrine-disrupting activity of these two compounds is due to thyroid system affection as reported (Coperchini et\u00a0al. 2021; Croce et\u00a0al. 2019) for nonafluorovaleric acid and (Chu et\u00a0al. 1983; den Besten et\u00a0al. 1991) for 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene. Therefore, in this case, the disagreement detected is more a consequence of our experimental models' limitations, and the in silico methods have produced a more informative result.\nIt is also interesting to highlight that the experimental method detected a number of ED-positive compounds that the RAX was not able to assess due to the low similarity with annotated compounds in CII. This fact further highlights the importance of including as many experimental annotations as possible in CII. This is also a cautionary result for avoiding interpreting \"non-assessment\" results obtained from RAX as negatives, something that can clearly lead to wrong conclusions."

This compound was predicted to be positive and the experimental results for micronucleus assay were negative, but the reprotoxicity assay could not be completed due to technical problems (the compound is too volatile).

The strategy combines the systematic collection of information from open access data sources, applying logical decision workflows to integrate all the annotations into simple labelling, and using in silico prediction methods for gap filling. Due to resource limitations, the method has been focused on a few endpoints: CMR, ED, PBT, and vPvB.\nThe substances used in LTI are very diverse and cover a region of the chemical space that has rarely been explored. Working with such a diverse group of substances is complex and time-consuming. We had to implement methods to handle complex substances with no associated chemical structure and to classify untreatable structures in diverse categories. We consider that the tools developed in our group for collecting this data, curating it, and the step-by-step protocols to analyse are worth reporting and sharing.\nThe method described is currently running, producing updated versions of the database every 3 months, enriching it with new compounds and annotation, and integrating more\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 12\nC\nM R\ne xp\ner im\nen ta\nl r es\nul ts\nc om\npa ris\non w\nith Q\nSA R\nm od\nel\na W hi\nle n\neu ro\nto xi\nc, th\ne eff\nec tiv\ne co\nnc en\ntra tio\nn ~ 1.\n9\u00a0 m\nM is\nfa r f\nro m\nb ei\nng m\net ab\nol ic\nal ly\nre le\nva nt\n.

Originally, the database contained 4634 compounds and 2875 endpoint annotations (YES: 1642, NO: 1194, Pending: 39). With our predictions, we increased these annotations to 9156 (YES: 2330, NO: 6826). These new predicted annotations will be included in the following versions of the database. Still, despite our efforts, there are a large number of annotations missing. Considering the total possible number of annotations (4634 \u00d7 4 = 18,536), the 9156 reported here are 49.39% of all annotations. When only high-confidence predictions are taken into account, the increase is 3037 (YES: 1764, NO: 1273), which are the 16.4% of the total possible annotations. This means that 50.61% of these annotations, (83.6% if only high-confidence predictions are used) are still unknown, which give us the idea of how much work is ahead if we want to complete an exhaustive safety characterization of all the compounds used in the LTI. Such investment is indeed justified by the preliminary results presented here, since a significant proportion of the predictions generated for non-informed compounds were indeed positive. These results further justify the ongoing efforts of the European Commission, as described in its Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (Conto 2021) to progress in the hazards and risk assessment of chemicals used by the industry.\nPart of the present work was devoted to reporting the results of a prospective validation exercise of the in silico methods used to fill the gaps in our database. The validation was rather strict and studied a series of compounds, including both reliable and unreliable predictions. The results obtained show that these methods can be a useful tool for producing provisional annotations, particularly if the predictions' reliability is taken into consideration. Another outcome of this exercise is a clearer idea of the prediction accuracy that can be expected in different situations, emphasizing the importance of keeping collecting high-quality data, as\nthis is the main limiting factor of the predictive quality of any in silico method.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00204- 023- 03459-7.\nAcknowledgements The authors acknowledge INDITEX S.A. for funding this project.
