1. **Investigate the use of more sophisticated diffusion models:** The current study uses a relatively simple diffusion model based on wrapped normal distributions. More sophisticated diffusion models, such as those based on score-matching or non-Gaussian distributions, could potentially improve the quality and diversity of the generated macrocycle conformers.


2. **Develop methods for incorporating additional data sources:** The current study only uses the CREMP dataset for training and evaluation. Incorporating additional data sources, such as experimental structures or molecular dynamics simulations, could help to improve the accuracy and generalizability of the model.


3. **Explore the use of RINGER for other types of cyclic molecules:** The current study focuses on macrocyclic peptides. However, RINGER could potentially be applied to other types of cyclic molecules, such as macrocyclic drugs or natural products. Investigating the performance of RINGER on these other types of molecules would be a valuable area of future research.


4. **Develop methods for generating macrocycle conformers in explicit solvent:** The current study uses an implicit solvent model. However, many macrocycles are used in aqueous environments. Developing methods for generating macrocycle conformers in explicit solvent would be a valuable area of future research.


5. **Investigate the use of RINGER for macrocycle design:** RINGER could potentially be used to design new macrocycles with desired properties, such as high affinity for a particular target or improved stability. Investigating the use of RINGER for macrocycle design would be a valuable area of future research.
