    "abstractText": "In this study, a combined in vitro digestion/Caco-2 model was performed with the aim to determine the phenolic compounds bioavailability of two yarrow extracts. HPLC-PAD characterisation indicated that the main components in both extracts were 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (DCQA) and luteolin-7-O-glucoside. Analyses after the simulated digestion process revealed that phenolic composition was not affected during the oral phase, whereas gastric and intestinal phases represented critical steps for some individual phenolics, especially intestinal step. The transition from gastric medium to intestinal environment caused an important degradation of 3,5-DCQA (63\u201367% loss), whereas 3,4-DCQA and 4,5-DCQA increased significantly, suggesting an isomeric transformation within these caffeic acid derivatives. However, an approx. 90% of luteolin-7-O-glucoside was recovered after intestinal step. At the end of Caco-2 absorption experiments, casticin, diosmetin and centaureidin represented the most abundant compounds in the basolateral fraction. Moreover, this fraction presented anti-inflammatory activity since was able to inhibit the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the presence in the basolateral fraction of flavonoid-aglycones from yarrow, could be related with the observed anti-inflammatory activity from yarrow extract.",

            "text": "Achillea millefolium L. (yarrow) is a flowering plant traditionally used in the treatment of digestive and hepatobiliary disorders, inflammation, and diabetes [1]. Recent reports indicated that Achillea genus presented important biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities [2]. Most health benefits of aqueous and alcoholic yarrow extracts have been associated with its composition in phenolic compounds, mainly phenolic acids (caffeic acid derivatives), and flavonoids (luteolin, apigenin and quercetin derivatives) [1,3]. Thus, Trumbeckaite et al. [4] related the antioxidant properties of an Achillea millefolium hydroalcoholic extract with the presence of luteolin and chlorogenic acid in the extract, and in a lesser extent with rutin and luteolin-7-Oglucoside. Pereira et al. [5] also reported that an A. millefolium hydroethanolic extract, containing 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, luteolin-O-acetylhexoside and apigenin-O-acetylhexoside as main phenolic compounds, inhibited the growth of human tumour cell lines. Furthermore, both essential oils and hydroethanolic yarrow extracts have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, causing the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production and IL-8 secretion in vitro [6,7]. Nevertheless, after oral consumption, phenolic compounds must be bioavailable in order to perform their potential health benefits. The bioavailability is dependent upon the stability of the compound during gastrointestinal digestion, its release from the food-matrix and the efficiency of its intestinal absorption. In yarrow, the assessment of mineral and\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8254. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27238254 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nvitamins bioaccessibility has been performed [8], but studies for phenolic compounds are still scarce. The stability of phenolic compounds during the gastrointestinal digestion is strongly influenced by their chemical structure, since phenolics present a different sensitivity to pH variations and digestive enzymes activity [9,10]. Moreover, the stability of phenolic compounds under gastrointestinal conditions highly depends on the nature of the matrix in which these compounds are included [11]. Thereby, Lingua et al. [12] reported that phenolic acids and quercetin were the most resistant polyphenols in white grape after a simulated digestion. However, Ortega-Vidal et al. [13] indicated that caffeoylquinic acids in herbal infusions were highly reduced by gastrointestinal digestion (approx. 10% remain). Moreover, Sp\u00ednola et al. [14] carried out extracts of Rumex maderensis and reported that the degradation of different phenolic classes after digestion varied within morphological parts employed (leaves, flowers, and stems). Thus, flavanols were the most stable compounds, although in flowers presented a reduction of 29.7% against 40.4% in stems. Hydroxycinnamic acids from leaves and flowers, presented a similar degradation rate (approx. 56.5%), meanwhile in stems extracts hydroxycinnamic acids were very unstable (71.8% reduction). After gastrointestinal digestion, the intestinal absorption of phenolic compounds has also been reported to be highly influenced by the phenolic compounds chemical structure. Bowles et al. [15] studied the intestinal transport across Caco-2 cell monolayer of nine phenolic acids found in an aqueous extract of Athrixia phylicoides, concluding that p-coumaric acid presented the highest transport. Besides, Wu et al. [16] reported that the absorption of caffeic acid was higher than chlorogenic acid in the Caco-2 model as well as in rat jejunum. Therefore, the use of an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell culture model has been proposed by several authors as an economical and useful alternative to the in vivo analysis, in order to investigate the bioavailability of phenolic compounds [12,17]. Concerning phenolic compounds extraction, several studies proposed the ultrasoundassisted extraction (UAE) as an adequate technique to obtain phenolic compounds from vegetal matrices [18,19]. In this regard, UAE has been reported to reduce extraction time and solvent consumption, as well as to maximizing the recoveries of bioactive compounds [20]. However, sometimes it is difficult to obtain highly concentrated extracts using only UAE, due to complexity of vegetable raw materials. Therefore, the use of adsorption resins (e.g., XAD-2, XAD-7, XAD-16 and Oasis HLB) has been successfully employed as a tool for selective enrichment of phenolic compounds from plant material [21,22]. The aim of this work was to study the bioavailability of yarrow phenolic compounds, by using a combined in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model. In addition, the influence of phenolics compounds concentration in the matrix on their bioavailability was also determined. Besides, the biological activity of Caco-2 basolateral fraction, in terms of anti-inflammatory activity was measured."

            "text": "Phenolic compounds identification of yarrow extract (YE) and yarrow phenolic enrichedextract (EE) was performed by HPLC-PAD-ESI-QTOF-MS allowing the identification of 49 phenolic compounds (Table S1). These results were in accordance with similar reported YE composition [23]. The quantitative analysis in both extracts (YE and EE) before and after the three-steps digestion process (oral, gastric, and intestinal) were shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. As can be observed, both extracts presented a similar behaviour during the gastrointestinal process. In general, the phenolic composition of both yarrow extracts was not affected during the oral phase, whereas gastric and intestinal phases, especially intestinal one, resulted as critical steps for some individual phenolic compounds. Figure S1 shows the base peak chromatogram of the EE before and after intestinal digestion, where the major differences can be observed.\na, b, c Different letters denote statistical differences within a line according to Fisher\u2019s least significant difference (LSD) procedure (p < 0.05).\na, b, c Different letters denote statistical differences within a line according to Fisher\u2019s least significant difference (LSD) procedure (p < 0.05).\nChlorogenic acid (CGA), the most abundant mono-caffeoylquinic acid in both extracts, was stable under oral and gastric conditions, but showed a loss of about 17% at the end of the intestinal step. However, it should be highlighted the higher quantity of neochlorogenic and cryptochlorogenic acids measured after intestinal step, whose increase could be attributed to CGA isomerization. This behaviour was also found by Bouayed et al. [24], who reported that CGA was stable to gastric conditions but degraded (between 23\u201341%) during intestinal digestion, with partial isomerisation to neochlorogenic and cryptochlorogenic acids. Yu et al. [25] also reported an important bioaccessibility (68.39\u201391.34%) after digestion process for chlorogenic acid obtained from mulberry leaves. With respect to dicaffeoylquinic acids (DCQAs), these compounds seem to be stable under oral conditions in both extracts. Gastric conditions mainly affected 3,5- and 4,5-DCQAs with a significant loss of approx. 20%. The transition from gastric medium to intestinal environment caused an important degradation of 3,5-DCQA (63\u201367% loss), whereas 3,4-DCQA and 4,5-DCQA significantly increased their quantity after intestinal step. This increment could be related with isomerization processes among different DCQAs at intestinal pH. Moreover, at the end of the intestinal step, the sum of all DCQAs represented the 90% of these compounds in the undigested extract. D\u2019Antuono et al. [26] previously described that 3,5-DCQA (pure individual compound) gastrointestinal digestion produced a higher isomerization effect with the presence of 3,4-DCQA and 4,5-DCQA. Both extracts, YE and EE, also presented an important quantity of flavonoids, either in glycosylated or in aglycone form. Among the glycosylated forms, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, the most abundant compound within flavonoids group, was stable to oral digestion but gastric conditions produced a decrease of approx. 20%. However, this compound increased up to 87\u201390% at the end of intestinal step. Guti\u00e9rrez-Grijalva et al. [27] also found that in digestion process, the quantity of luteolin-7-O-glucoside decreased after gastric step but increased at the end of intestinal step. They indicated that the loss of luteolin-7-Oglucoside after gastric phase could be related, in addition to pH changes, to a possible interaction between the compound and gastric enzymes that render it undetectable in chromatographic analysis. Regarding aglycones, luteolin was also stable to oral step but hardly affected by gastric conditions (approx. 50% loss). Moreover, luteolin registered an increased when intestinal phase ended. This behaviour was observed in other aglycones such as casticin and centaureidin. According with previous results, this effect could be also related with possible interactions between digestive enzymes and phenolics, as was detected for luteolin-7-O-glucoside. Digestion effect on total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity for both extracts is shown in Table 3. During digestion process, the amount of TPC only decreased slightly for both extracts (between 7\u201313%). Regarding antioxidant activity, this was not significantly affected during oral phase, however, stomach and intestinal phases resulted in critical steps for this activity (26\u201340% decrease). This loss of antioxidant activity could be related with the losses registered in some phenolic compounds, such as luteolin and its glucosylated derivatives, since these compounds have been reported to present an important antioxidant activity [28]. However, the isomerization effect occurred in some compounds (i.e., CGA and DCQAs) could also be related. Shang et al. [29] indicated that among DCQA isomers from a L. fischeri leaves ethanolic extract, 3,5-DCQA presented the highest radical scavenging activity.\n1 TPC = mg GAE/g extract. 2 TEAC value = mmol Trolox/g extract. a,b,c,d Different letters denote statistical differences within a same line, according to Fisher\u2019s least significant difference (LSD) procedure (p < 0.05)."

            "heading": "2.2. Caco-2 Cells Transport Experiments",
            "text": "In order to investigate the potential bioavailability of digested yarrow phenolic compounds, their intestinal uptake was evaluated using Caco-2 cells monolayers at 2, 4 and 6 h. Due to EE digested extract presented a 2\u20133 fold superior concentration of phenolic compounds, this extract was selected to carry out the transport experiments. The cytotoxicity assays, performed by the MTT method, indicated that 40 \u00b5L/mL of digested EE was the maximum concentration that did not affect the cell viability during 6 h (data not shown). Thus, the concentration of EE phenolic compounds detected in the apical compartment, cellular monolayer, and basolateral compartment after 2, 4 and 6 h of transport experiments are shown in Table 4. After 2 h of incubation, 11 phenolic compounds were identified in the cell monolayer, mainly flavonoid aglycones (casticin, diosmetin and centaureidin) and DCQAs isomers (3,4-DCQA and 3,5-DCQA). The concentration of those compounds in cell monolayer decreased after 4 and 6 h of experiment. Regarding the basolateral compartment, after 2 h of incubation, casticin was the main compound, followed by 3,4 and 3,5-DCQAs. Data obtained after 4 h showed an increase in casticin, diosmetin and centaureidin concentration in the basolateral compartment, meanwhile the amount of 3,5-DCQA remains constant and 3,4-DCQA slightly decreased. Successively, an increment in the quantity of casticin, diosmetin and centaureidin continued until 6 h of experiment, while neither 3,4 nor 3,5-DCQAs were detected at that time. Casticin (a methoxylated flavonol) was the most abundant compound in the basolateral fraction (after 6 h, a 41.7% from digested extract). The apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) for casticin presented a maximum value at 2 h (Papp = 16.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm s\u22121) in comparison with 4 h and 6 h (Papp = 10.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 10.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm s\u22121, respectively). These results suggested that casticin permeability was time-dependent and transported across the Caco-2 monolayers with a faster rate at a shorter incubation time. In spite of in vitro studies of casticin\u2019s permeability are still scare; Piazzini et al. [30] reported a casticin\u2019s Papp value of 8.1 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm s\u22121 across Caco-2 cells, after 4 h incubation with a Vitex agnus-castus extract. Diosmetin\u2019s uptake also increased with incubation time. Surprisingly, the sum of diosmetin amount in cell monolayer and basolateral fraction (at 2, 4 or 6 h), was higher than the concentration of this compound initially placed in the apical side (0.84 \u00b1 0.1 mg/L of digested extract). Thus, considering that diosmetin is the 4\u2032-methyl derivative of luteolin, the detected increment could be originated from the metabolism of luteolin (aglycone) and/or luteolin glycosylated-derivatives presented in the digested extract. The occurrence of diosmetin as a principal methylated metabolite from luteolin was reported in rats [31]. Centaureidin represented the third most abundant compound in the basolateral fraction after 6 h. This methylated flavonol, also showed a time-dependent absorption through Caco-2 cell monolayer, being more rapidly transported at earlier incubation time (Papp at 2 h = 7.0 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm s\u22121). To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies had been reported for centaureidin\u2019s in vitro absorption. In general, a passive transcellular diffusion through Caco-2 monolayer could be related with casticin, diosmetin and centaureidin absorption. Nevertheless, interactions of diosmetin with selected transporters such as mul-\ntidrug resistance-associated protein isoform 1 (MRP1) and monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 (MCT1), also expressed in Caco-2 cells, have been previously described [32].\na, b, c Different letters denote statistical differences within a line according to Fisher\u2019s least significant difference (LSD) procedure (p < 0.05). n.d.: not detected.\nThe amounts of 3,4-DCQA and 3,5-DCQA detected in the basolateral compartment after 2 and 4 h of incubation were quite smaller with respect to their amounts in the apical side, showing a Papp calculated values (at 4 h) of 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm s\u22121 for 3,4-DCQA and 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm s\u22121 for 3,5-DCQA. Similarly, Zhou et al. [33] indicated that DCQAs showed, after 4 h, Papp values of approx. 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm s\u22121. However, at 6 h, unexpectedly no DCQAs isomers were detected in basolateral fraction (Table 4). In consistence with this result, D\u2019Antuono et al. [26], did not also detect any DCQAs isomer in the basolateral side, but coumaric and caffeic acids were found in this fraction, suggesting a cellular metabolism activity. However, in our results neither caffeic nor coumaric acids were found in the basolateral fraction at detectable amounts with the analytical technique employed. Regarding Caco-2 transport, Zhou et al. [33] described DCQAs absorption mainly by passive diffusion via paracellular pathways, although some interactions of DCQAs with certain transporters were also reported in vitro [34]. In that context, when evaluating the absorption of a complex plant-extract, we would have to consider that certain phenolics may act like substrates or inhibitors of some transporters expressed in Caco-2 cells, thus, they could act as permeability modifiers for other compounds [35]."

In addition, the basolateral fraction from control digestion (digestion fluids without extract) was also tested. These results are shown in Figure 1. As can be observed, after 24 h the stimulated macrophages (positive control) revealed a significant release of the three pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, compared to non-stimulated cells (negative control). Previous experiments to assess the cytotoxicity of the basolateral fraction indicated that 20 \u00b5L/mL did not compromise the macrophages viability (data not shown). Thus, when THP-1 macrophages were incubated with LPS in presence of 10 and 20 \u00b5L/mL of the basolateral media, TNF-\u03b1 secretion was not modified, compared with the levels obtained in absence of the extracts (Figure 1A). In contrast, a significant reduction of IL-1\u03b2 secreted was observed in presence of both concentrations of basolateral fraction, approx. 30% and 40% for 10 and 20 \u00b5L/mL (Figure 1B). The IL-6 release was also supressed approx. 25% when applied 20 \u00b5L/mL of basolateral fraction (Figure 1C).\nFigure 1.

Materials and Methods\n3.1. Yarrow Extract and Yarrow Phenolic Compounds-Enriched Extract Obtention\nUpper-dried inflorescences of yarrow were obtained from a local supplier (Planta-\nfarm S.A., Le\u00f3n, Spain). The sample was ground (Premill 250, Leal S.A., Granollers, Spain)\nand sieved to diminish its particle size (<500 \u03bcm). YE was obtained by ultrasound assisted\nextraction accordingly to Villalva et al. [23]. Briefly, the ground yarrow was soaked with\npure ethanol (plant/solvent 1:10, w/v) and conducted to extraction (30 min, \u226440 \u00b0C) in a\nBranson 450 ultrasonic device (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT, USA). The solvent was\nremoved in a vacuum rotary evaporator (35 \u00b0C) (IKA RV 10, VWR, Madrid, Spain) to ob-\ntain a dry extract.\nIn order to obtain the EE, a fractionation process was conducted using XAD-7HP\nmacroporous resins (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) packed in a glass column (bed\nvolume, BV, 225 mL) and a mixture of ethanol:water (80:20, v/v) as elution solvent. A vol-\nume (70 mL) of YE (15 mg/mL final concentration) was placed in the column. After 1 h to\nallowing the absorption equilibrium, a water-washing step was required (2 BV) to later\nrecover the phenolic compounds using 80% ethanol (3 BV at 2 BV/h). At the end, the eth-\nanol was evaporated in a rotary evaporator and freeze-dried to remove the water. The\nextracts were kept at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. All experiments were done by triplicate.\nA graphical flowchart summarizing the main steps of the experimental procedure\napplied is provided in Figure 2.\nab\nc\na b\na a\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n(A )\nT N\nF -\u03b1\nS ec\nre ti\no n\n( %\n)\na\ne\nc d\nb b\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n(B )\nI L\n-1 \u03b2\nS ec\nre ti\no n\n( %\n)\na\nd\nb\nc\na a\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n(C )\nI L\n-6 S\nec re\nti o\nn (\n% )\nFigure 1.

Considering that this fraction was mainly composed by casticin, diosmetin and centaureidin, these flavonoids could be related, at least partially, with the antiinflammatory activity. Casticin was shown to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS [36]. Moreover, diosmetin also reduced the generation of pro-inflammatory mediators like NO, TNF-\u03b1 in adipocytes and macrophages, and IL-1\u03b2 e IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast [37]. Finally, ce taureidin has been also effectively inhibited expressio of COX-1 and OX-2 enzymes related with the inflammatory response [38]. Nevertheless, the influence of other co pounds, including those found in minor concentrations or even those non-detected metabolites of phenolic compounds, cannot be ruled out."

Mostly CGA and DCQAs suffered an isomerization effect after intestinal step. Besides flavonoids, either in their glycosylated or aglycone form, were also reduced after intestinal phase. Casticin, diosmetin and centaureidin were the most abundant compounds found in the basolateral fraction after Caco-2 experiments at 6 h. This fraction also exhibited a certain inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Thus, the phenolic composition found in this fraction, mainly methoxylated flavonoids, could be related with the observed bioactivity. Although in vitro results cannot be directly extrapolated to human in vivo conditions, our findings exhibit a potential bioavailability of phenolic compounds present in yarrow extracts.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27238254/s1, Table S1: Phenolic compounds identified in yarrow samples by using HPLC-PAD-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS in negative ionization mode.
