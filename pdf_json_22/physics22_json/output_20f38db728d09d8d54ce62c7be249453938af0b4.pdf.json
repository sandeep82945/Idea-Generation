    "abstractText": "Although it has been shown experimentally that a temperature discontinuity exists at the liquidvapor interface during evaporation and condensation, quantitatively modeling this temperature jump has been difficult. The classical Schrage equation does not give enough information to determine the interfacial temperature jump. Starting from the Boltzmann transport equation, this paper establishes three interfacial boundary conditions to connect the temperature, density, and pressure jumps at the liquid-vapor interface to the interfacial mass and heat fluxes: one for the mass flux (the Schrage equation), one for the heat flux, and the third for the density discontinuities. These expressions can be readily coupled to heat and mass transport equations in the continuum of the liquid and the vapor phases, enabling one to determine the values of the interfacial temperature, density, and pressure jumps. Comparison with past experiments is favorable. A thermomolecular emission model, mimicking thermionic emission of electrons, is also presented to gain more molecular-level insights on the thermal evaporation processes. * Email: gchen2@mit.edu",

The classical Schrage equation does not give enough information to determine the interfacial temperature jump.

            "text": "Evaporation and condensation processes happen widely in nature and industrial technologies [1\u2013 4]. Interfacial temperature discontinuity in these processes has been recognized [5,6], supported by direct measurements across liquid-vapor interfaces [7\u201314], kinetic theory-based modeling [15\u201322], Monte Carlo simulation [23], and molecular dynamics simulations[24\u201327]. Although some heat transfer models recognized the existence of such temperature discontinuities, most of the time, the temperature discontinuity is neglected. There seems to be ambiguity on the physical mechanisms of the temperature discontinuity at the liquid-vapor interface during phasechange heat transfer, as well as a lack of convenient physics-based models to treat the interfacial discontinuities. The objectives of this paper are to provide simplified kinetic theory-based interfacial conditions for determining the discontinuities in temperature, density, and pressure and a microscopic emission picture for the thermal evaporation process. These interfacial conditions can be combined with continuum equations for modeling phase-change processes.\nThe literature on evaporation and condensation is vast and cannot possibly be reviewed within this short introduction. Here, we will briefly mention key historical developments. Pioneering studies of evaporation were carried out by Hertz [28] and Knudsen [29]. Hertz measured evaporation of mercury. Knudsen also measured mercury and introduced the concept of the\ncoefficient of evaporation, a. Langmuir made original contributions to evaporation through his study of tungsten evaporation at high temperatures [30]. Knacke and Stranski [31] gave a good summary of the experiments and understanding of evaporation mechanisms prior to 1956. The Hertz-Knudsen equation, which can be readily derived from the kinetic theory by neglecting any collision of the molecules, gives the evaporation mass flux between two parallel plates:\n?\u0307?!\" \u2248 \ud835\udefc% # 2$%! &&\"((#) *(# \u2212 &$ *($ ) = \ud835\udefc% + ,$- &&\"((#) *(# \u2212 &$ *($ ), (1)\nwhere Ps is the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid surface temperature Tl, and Pv and Tv are the vapor phase pressure and temperature near the interface, kB the Boltzmann\nconstant, m the mass of a single molecular, R the universal gas constant, M the molar mass, and\na the accommodation coefficient.\nSchrage [32] in his PhD thesis also gave a good review of the prior work, including work before Hertz. He argued that the Hertz and Knudsen formula did not consider the drift velocity of the evaporating molecules. After considering molecular drift, the equation he arrived at differs from Eq. (1) in the prefactor,\n?\u0307?. \u2248 ,/ ,0/ % + 2$- &&\"((#) *(# \u2212 &$ *($ ) (2)\nThe Schrage equation is widely used as a fundamental relation for evaporative and condensation heat transfer. Knowing the evaporation and condensation rates, one usually finds the heat transfer rate by multiplying ?\u0307?. and the latent heat of evaporation. We show in this article that the latter is at best only an approximation.\nAlthough Schrage derived the molecular distribution function near the interface that is consistent with the drift of the molecules, his theory did not include the effect of heat transfer across the interface. The molecular flux expression Eq. (2) depends on Tl, Pv and Tv, which are usually not known themselves. Coupling Eq. (2) with continuum descriptions on the liquid and the vapor phases do not give enough equations to determine these unknowns. The exact location of Pv and Tv in Eqs. (1) and (2) is not clear, although it is generally considered to be at the edge of the Knudsen layer, i.e., with several mean free path from the liquid-vapor interface. Furthermore, there are no easy ways to determine these quantities in typical heat transfer situations such as film evaporation or condensation. Based on solutions to the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), different approximate expressions have been given relating the interfacial mass and heat fluxes to the liquid side pressure (Ps) and temperature (Tl), the vapor side pressure (Pv) and temperature (Tv), and the accommodation coefficient (\ud835\udefc) [18\u201320,22,33] . It is fair to say that the interfacial heat flux expressions derived by different authors have not come to the same level of clarities as in the Hertz-Knudsen and Schrage expressions for the mass flux. Even with any of the derived\ninterfacial heat flux expression, I will show that there are still not sufficient equations to solve for all the unknowns when combined with continuum descriptions on the two phases.\nExperimentally, Ward and co-workers [7,8] measured the temperature profile of a liquid-vapor interface and noticed that quite a large temperature discontinuity exists at the interface. Although most solutions of the BTE will predict a temperature discontinuity, no theory seems to have been able to predict the magnitude of the measured temperature discontinuity [9,34]. Ward and co-workers developed a statistical rate theory and the corresponding evaporation rate to replace the Schrage equation, but the theory still has the same difficulties in terms of not having enough equations to solve for the unknowns [35]. Bond and Struchtrup [34] used kinetic theory with an interfacial temperature discontinuity to model Ward\u2019s experiment, but their model showed much smaller temperature discontinuity than the experiments, although the agreement with experiments became better after including surface curvature. Follow-up experiments by several other groups also showed the interfacial temperature discontinuities [9\u2013 14], as well summarized in Ref. [23] . Badam et al. [9] used the temperature discontinuity boundary condition of Cipolla et al. [20], but found that the modeling results were 10-20 times smaller than their experimental data.\nThe lack of favorable comparison between experiments and modeling, coupled to difficulties in the experiments and modeling, raises doubt on the existence of the interfacial temperature jumps. However, discontinuities at interfaces are rules rather than exceptions in different fields. Well-known examples are velocity and temperature slips in rarefied gas flow [36], phonon interfacial thermal resistance [37], the Deissler temperature jump boundary condition for thermal radiation [38], and interfacial voltage drops. These discontinuity conditions provide a convenient way to connect transport through the interfacial region with the bulk region. Different ways to derive the discontinuity conditions had been developed, as the starting points of the transport equations are usually different. However, for most dilute particles, kinetic theory based on the BTE provides a common starting point [39,40]. I had shown before that one can consistently derive the interfacial discontinuity conditions for different carriers starting from the\ndiffusion approximation to the BTE, which I called diffusion-transmission boundary conditions, and applied the strategy to study rarefied fluid flow, heat conduction, and electrical contact resistance [41,42].\nIn this work, I will follow same strategies to derive a set of interfacial conditions that are sufficient to connect the Knudsen layer with the liquid and vapor continuum phases, which include, in addition to the well-known Schrage equation, a relation between the interfacial heat flux and temperature discontinuity, as well as an expression for the interfacial density discontinuity (Sec. 3). With these interfacial relations, one can connect continuum descriptions for the liquid and the vapor-phases and solve for the temperature, density, and pressure of both phases immediately near the interface. These solutions will give interfacial temperature, density, and pressure jumps. I will show the usefulness of these interfacial conditions by first demonstrating that these conditions can well explain the past experimental data on the interfacial temperature discontinuities [7,9]. (Sec. 4.1). Since most evaporation and condensation heat transfer experiments report an overall evaporating heat transfer coefficient, I will connect the overall heat transfer coefficient to the single-phase convective heat transfer coefficient. Such modeling suggests that the interfacial temperature discontinuities are not negligible for practical heat transfer scenarios (Sec. 4.2). Before deriving interfacial discontinuity conditions, I will provide a thermomolecular emission model for the transport between the liquid and vapor phases (Sec. 2), mimicking the well-established thermionic emission theory for electron transport across interfaces. Although the final interfacial conditions do not depend on this model, I believe the thermomolecular emission model provides useful insights on the interfacial phase-change process and the origin of the evaporation and condensation coefficients that are often used in literature. Because this paper includes many derivations, I will put most of these derivations in supplemental materials (SM) for interested readers, while focusing the main text on key results."

            "text": "I use the phrase \u201cthermomolecular emission\u201d to mimic the \u201cthermionic emission\u201d that was discovered by Edmond Becquerel in 1853 [43] and rediscovered by Thomas Edison in 1880 [44]. Thermionic emission refers to the evaporation of electrons from hot metal surface as shown in Fig.1(a). Most mobile electrons have energy near the Fermi level. Those electrons with kinetic energy larger than the workfunction can escape the metal surface, entering the surrounding vacuum. The correct theory for thermionic emission was developed by Owen Richardson [45,46]. The development of the thermionic emission theory invoked the physical picture behind liquid thermal evaporation. Ironically, I have not found a similar theory for the liquid thermal evaporation. In this section, I will present such a theory, and call it the thermomolecular emission theory in analogy to the thermionic emission. The thermionic emission model is also often the basis for extension to include other processes such as photon-enhanced thermionic emission [47]. The thermomolecular emission model presented below might also serve as a starting point to model the photomolecular evaporation processes that we recently discovered [48,49].\nThermal evaporation bears a similar picture to thermionic emission, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Molecules in the liquid are bound together near its average potential energy, which is lower than\nthe vapor phase (analogous to vacuum) by D, the latent heat per molecule. The water latent heat at 25 oC is 2346.3 kJ/kg, which is equivalent to 0.44 eV/molecule. The kinetic energy of molecules spread from zero to infinite. These molecules in the interfacial region with kinetic energy larger than D can escape liquid and enter the vapor phase, as suggested also by molecular dynamics simulations [50].\nA key challenge in modeling liquid is to specify the statistical distribution function. Unlike dilute gases which can be described by the one-particle Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, liquid molecules are strongly correlated with each other via potential interactions. Liquid molecules also differ from that in crystalline solids, which are periodically arranged [51]. The randomness plus the strong correlation have hindered progress in describing thermal transport in liquid. The\nBBGKY hierarchy is an approach that progressively reduces the N-particle distribution function (where N is the total number of molecules or atoms) to eventually the one-particle distribution function, i.e., the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution [52,53],\n\ud835\udc531(\ud835\udc97) = \ud835\udc5b1 1 # ,$%!( 2 2/, \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d 6\u2212#45% &65'&65(&7/, %!((8) 7, (3)\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, m is the molecular mass, T the absolute temperature, v the velocity with components vx, vy, vz, and nL the density of the liquid. Unlike dilute gas, for which the N-particular distribution function is the product of the one-particle distributions, the liquid N-particle distribution functions cannot be constructed from the one-particle distribution function alone. However, for our purpose of considering the evaporation of individual molecules, assuming validity of Eq. (3) for each molecule is a reasonable starting point, since the kinetic energy expression remains the same even for correlated liquid molecules [53]. Using the above distribution function, and assuming only molecules with kinetic energy component in the\ndirection perpendicular to the interface (the z-direction) larger than the energy barrier D can escape the interface, i.e.,\n9 , \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc638, \u2265 \u2206, (4)\nthe flux of the molecules that can leave surface is (see SM, Sec.1)\n\ud835\udc3d#6 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc5b1% %!(# ,$# \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d 6\u2212 : %!(# 7. (5)\nIn the above expression, e is artificially added to include nonidealities, representing the molecular\nemittance from the liquid phase. Note that e is not the evaporation coefficient as used in the evaporation literature [33] because here nL is the liquid density while the evaporation coefficient is defined based on the vapor density. Its relationship with the evaporation coefficient will be discussed later. Detailed math behind arriving at Eq. (5) is given in the SM, Sec. 1, in which I also give an expression when the condition for molecules leaving the surface is set as the total kinetic energy larger than the energy barrier. Richardson\u2019s original work did consider this latter case, although the classical expression for thermionic emission used in electronics mostly imposes the condition of normal component of kinetic energy larger than the energy barrier as Eq. (4).\nThe above expression describes molecules leaving the liquid-vapor interface. Meanwhile, molecules from the vapor phase also moves towards the interface. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, Eq. (3) can be more easily justified for molecules in the vapor phase (it does imply the ideal gas approximation). We consider vapor molecules adjacent to the liquid surface and neglect the collisions among the molecules themselves. Some of these molecules move towards to liquid surface. The vapor molecular flux absorbed by the liquid surface can be similarly obtained as (SM, Sec. 1)\n\ud835\udc3d#0 = \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5b5% %!($ ,$# , (6)\nwhere nV is the density of the vapor-phase molecules and Tv its temperature, a represents the fraction of incoming vapor flux absorbed by the liquid phase, i.e., the condensation coefficient.\nIn deriving Eq. (6), we assumed that the vapor molecules near the interface obey the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution, and yet they reach the interface without any collision. These two assumptions conflict each other intrinsically in the following sense. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution means molecules are in thermal equilibrium, which can only be reached if there are collisions among molecules. Hence, Eq. (6) is at best an approximation where Tv is considered as the vapor temperature at the edge of the Knudsen layer, but any collision within the Knudsen layer is neglected. Extensively studies had been reported in the past treating collisions within the Knudsen layer via solving the Boltzmann transport equation, Monte Carlo simulations, and molecular dynamics simulations, as cited before. In these studies, Tv is usually considered as a boundary condition at the outer edge of the Knudsen layer. However, we should bear in mind that even at the edge of the Knudsen layer where continuum description is considered valid, the transport is still at nonequilibrium. At equilibrium, i.e., when Tl=Tv, the outgoing and incoming flux are balanced \ud835\udc3d;6 = \ud835\udc3d;0, which leads to\n/ < = =# =\" \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d 6\u2212 : %!(# 7, (7)\nwhere we use ns to represent nv at equilibrium with the liquid, i.e., the saturation condition. This is an example of the detailed balance principle, which in fact applies not only to the total flux integrated over all directions as we used here, but also along each direction. Because of the detailed balance principle, the outgoing flux can also be expressed using the vapor phase properties:\n\ud835\udc3d#6 = \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc47>)\ud835\udc5b;(\ud835\udc47>)% %!(# ,$# . (8)\nIn the above expression, I was careful to denote that ns and \ud835\udefc should be taken at the temperature of the liquid surface. In literature, a in Eq. (8) is often defined as the evaporation coefficient [33]. The detailed balance principle, i.e., at equilibrium, there is no net flux, guarantees that the\nevaporation coefficient equals the condensation coefficient or the accommodation coefficient. When the evaporation coefficient is directionally and energetically dependent, the detailed balance principle guarantees that the evaporation and condensation coefficients are equal for every direction and molecular velocity. When \ud835\udc47> \u2260 \ud835\udc475, the net molecular mass flux is the difference between \ud835\udc3d#6 and \ud835\udc3d#0 ,\n\ud835\udc3d# = \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc47>)\ud835\udc5b;(\ud835\udc47>)% %!(# ,$# \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc475)\ud835\udc5b5(\ud835\udc475)% %!($ ,$# \u2248 \ud835\udefc% 9 ,$+? &&\"((#) *(# \u2212 &$(($) *($ ), (9)\nwhere in the last step we have replaced the molecular density with the ideal gas relation \ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc58@\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc47. The above relation is Hertz-Knudsen equation given in Eq. (1). In arriving at this equation, we assumed that the condensation coefficient is independent of temperature. [NO_PRINTED_FORM]In reality, the condensation coefficient depends strongly on temperature, as we will show below.\nThe use of detailed balance principle enables us to express the emission of molecules from liquid in terms of vapor properties as in Eq. (8). This approach was also taken by Herring and Nichols in their treatment of thermionic emission [54]. It is also well-established in thermal radiation where we use the blackbody radiation law in vacuum rather than inside the emitting medium, with a similar to emissivity, and its equality to the condensation coefficient similar to the Kirchhoff\u2019s law [55]. However, the treatment of thermomolecular emission process from liquid phase sheds light on the physical pictures of thermal evaporation, which we will discuss below.\nFirst, the Gibbs phase rule says that for pure substance at liquid-vapor phase equilibrium, only one intensive property, for example temperature, is changeable. For a given temperature, the saturation pressure and the liquid and the vapor phase molecular densities are all fixed. We use saturated water data and set \u2206= \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3f/\ud835\udc41A, where NA is the Avogadro constant, L the latent heat, and obtain the ratio of a/e according to Eq. (7) based on water properties. This ratio is shown in\nFig. 2(a). One can see that a/e depends strongly on temperature. This strong temperature\ndependence hints that a itself is strongly temperature dependent and explains why often one needs to separate the evaporation coefficient from the condensation coefficient.\nSecond, in the above calculation, we assumed that the latent heat is the energy barrier needed to overcome. This picture is not entirely correct, however, since molecules at the surface have higher energy than that of the molecules inside, while the latent heat per molecule is averaged to all molecules in the domain and dominated by molecules in the bulk region. Suppose that the\nenergy per molecule at the surface is s, then the energy barrier needed to overcome for\nevaporation is D-s. Evaluating s, however, is difficult, as the density of interfacial molecules\nchange from bulk liquid to vapor phase over a distance of 3-7 \u212b [56,57], i.e., involving several molecular layers, and the measured surface tension includes contributions from this region. I attempted to attribute the measured water surface tension to one molecular layer of water on the surface, and replace D in Eq. (7) by D-s, the obtained \ud835\udefc/\ud835\udf00 ratio is shown in Fig. 2(b). In this case, a becomes much larger than e and the temperature dependence becomes different, which is probably because I attributed the surface tension to only one molecular layer. In reality, several molecular layers of water molecules contribute to the surface tension.\nAlso unknown is the distance d within liquid itself for the liquid molecule energy to change from\nbulk value D to their values at surface D-s. Over this distance, the liquid is cooled, but this cooling is coupled to heat conduction within the liquid phase and the vapor phase. There seems to be no study on this distance. However, surface tension theory suggests that molecules in the surface region experience anisotropic tension (or pressure) [58]. Within the same d, the pressure changes from isotropic for molecules in the bulk region to anisotropy pressure in the surface region.\nWhen molecules leave the liquid-vapor interface, they also experience an attractive force from the bulk dense molecules in the surface region and inside the bulk region. This force is sometimes attributed to the van der Waals force but is more generally called Casimir force, characterized by the Hamaker constant [59]. The van der Waals force is an electrostatic picture while the Casimir force is based on the electrodynamic picture, typically modelled using the fluctuating electrodynamic approach. This is the origin of the disjoining pressure [59]. A valid question is if the disjoining pressure should be included in phase change modeling.\nFor evaporation from a bulk liquid surface, the equilibrium condition between the bulk liquid and its vapor phase already included the disjoining pressure caused by the above-mentioned force. This force will affect values of the evaporation and condensation coefficients. However, for a very thin liquid film on a solid substrate, molecules in the vapor phase near the liquid surface will experience a different force due to the long-range interaction with the solid substrate materials. In this case, correction to this different interaction should be made, under the concept of disjoining pressure [59]. Rigorous calculation of this disjoining pressure can be done based on the fluctuational electrodynamics used for calculating the Casimir force. This also explains why accommodation coefficient depends on materials.\nAnother question is if the latent heat should be used, or the internal energy difference between\nthe vapor and the liquid phase should be used in estimating D. The latent heat is the enthalpy\nchange between the liquid and the vapor phase, which includes the work done by volume expansion. Although the above discussion was based the latent heat, i.e., enthalpy, in estimating D, using internal energy difference during phase transition to estimate D would better reflect that\nit represents the potential energy difference. Fig. 1(b) includes a/e ratio based both the enthalpy and the internal energy changes during the liquid-vapor phase transition.\nClearly, the above discussions are qualitative. Based on the water data (energy, enthalpy, and surface tension), it seems that both e and a depend strongly on temperature. Although past literature had emphasized evaporation coefficient could be different from condensation coefficient, the above discussion suggests what we really need is the temperature dependence of the condensation coefficient. This view was also indicated in the discussion of Ref. [60]."

The density and the temperature gradients both contribute to the mass and heat transfer, and the cross terms represented by L12 and L21 are related, a manifestation of the Onsager reciprocity relation.\nWe can write Eq.

Or alternatively, one can argue that the velocity itself is defined based on Eq. (13), including the temperature and density gradient terms. The former treatment completely neglects the diffusion process under temperature and density gradients. In the case of pure heat conduction, u=0 and one can use the mass flux equaling zero to eliminate the density gradient in arriving at\nthe proper thermal conductivity as given in Eq. (17) [39,40]. However, when there is macroscopic convection, it is unlikely that the two diffusion terms in Eq. (13) cancel each other. How to treat such self-diffusion is a question still under debate [63\u201368]. Brenner introduced a mass velocity and a volume velocity and modifications to the Navier-Stokes equations [63,64]. Similar treatment was introduced by Elizarova [[67]. The treatment presented here is consistent with their views. Equation (16) is the consequence of ensuring that density n(z) represents the local density in the continuum (see SI, Sec.2)."

Note that unlike the vapor phase which obeys the drifted Maxwellian distribution, molecules leaving the liquid phase have a much smaller velocity, which is neglected in Eq. (18).\nIn the diffusion-transmission approach to derive the interfacial discontinuities [41], the distribution of molecules coming towards the interface is identical to that used for the diffusion approximation, but only for vz<0 and at z=0, i.e., the density, temperature, and velocity in Eq. (12) are the values in the vapor phase at z=0. These approximations are inherently similar to those used in the Hertz-Knudsen or the Schrage equations, implying that we neglect the finite thickness and collisions within the Knudsen layer that eventually lead to the molecular distribution following the diffusion approximation Eq. (12). The values of Tv(0), u(0), and nv(0) are actually values at the outer edge of the Knudsen layer. Many of the past treatments of the Knudsen layer also assumed that the molecules outside the Knudsen layer obey the displaced Boltzmann distribution, i.e., Eq. (11), with however zero gradients of n, T, and u beyond the\nKnudsen layer. Such zero gradients are inconsistent with continued diffusion in the continuum region as represented by Eqs. (13)-(17). In contrast, the use of Eq. (12) to represent the distribution of molecules coming towards evaporating interface ensures that interfacial conditions we derived below are consistent with diffusion in the continuum. Hence, we expect that the ballistic transport approximation within the Knudsen layer incurs inaccuracy compared to models rigorously treating the Knudsen layer, but gains accuracy in connecting with the continuum treatment.\nAmong the incoming molecules, only a fraction a(Tv(0)) is absorbed similar to Eq. (6). The rest fraction 1- a(Tv(0)) is reflected. Subtle questions are what the distribution of the reflected molecules is and what the equivalent temperature of these reflected molecules is. The most likely process is that molecules get absorbed and then re-emitted. But if that is the case, it means an accommodation coefficient equaling one. In fact, most molecular dynamics simulations suggest indeed that accommodation coefficient is close to one, although experimental values vary several orders of magnitude [60]. To keep an accommodation coefficient in the theory, probably the next good assumption is diffuse scattering. That is, the incoming molecular flux is redistributed isotropically into the hemispherical direction. It is also possible to assume some specular reflection, i.e., the reflected molecules will leave surface in mirror-like fashion. My derivation will use this latter approximation for mathematical simplicity, although physically, diffuse scattering is more likely. For transport in the perpendicular direction, my sense is that\nthe difference between the two approximations should be relatively small, especially when a is close unity. Molecular dynamics simulations do show that kinetic energy distributions can be anisotropic as characterized by anisotropic temperatures [26,27]. Specular reflection approximation would lead to some kinetic energy anisotropy that is consistent with such simulations.\nUsing \ud835\udc53;6(\ud835\udc47>) in Eq. (18) for vz>0, we can express the outgoing mass flux from the interface as (SM, Sec. 1)\n\ud835\udc3d#6 = \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5b;(\ud835\udc47>)% %!(# ,$#\n(19)\nand using Eq.

It is interesting that Schrage\u2019s derivation included only the drift velocity but did not include the temperature nor the density gradients, while what we presented here included all three terms, and yet the final results are the same because contributions from both the density and temperature gradients to the distortion of the distribution function weigh\nequally as the drift contribution (ru) he considered."

Sone and Onishi derived a temperature jump boundary condition but they had a different form [18]. Our form is similar to that of Bond and Struchtrup [34], although their coefficients are more complicated since they employed a model of condensation coefficient that depends on energy. In their work, diffuse and specular reflection is considered, where the diffuse reflection is assumed to obey the Maxwell distribution with a different equivalent pressure and liquid temperature. At equilibrium, they further proved that the pressure for diffuse evaporation must be the saturation pressure, using the detailed balance principle. However, during nonequilibrium, they calculated a different equivalent pressure for the diffusely reflected molecules. Their Eq. (44) is identical to what I presented above.\nBarrett and Clement [33] actually derived a similar equation as Eq. (25), again without considering the diffusion terms. However, they argued that this equation is in conflict what one will get by multiplying the mass flux as given by the Schrage equation with the enthalpy of the vapor 5RT/2. Due to this conflict, they stated that the Schrage equation violates energy and momentum conservation laws, hence casting doubts on the Schrage equation. I cannot agree with Barrett and Clement for the following reasons. From the above derivations for both the Schrage equation and the interfacial heat flux expression, it is clear that the interfacial region is in highly nonequilibrium states. One cannot easily define a temperature. An enthalpy of 5RTv/2 represents the local equilibrium temperature, while the molecules going in the positive and the negative z-directions are clearly at different temperatures and carry different enthalpies. Mathematically, one cannot write the product of two quantities in the phase-space integral, see for example Eq.(A34) which is the product of molecular flux and molecular kinetic energy, as the product of two averaged quantities.\nAnother fine detail is also worth mentioning. The above discussion clear defines that the interfacial temperature jump as represented by Eq. (27) is between the liquid surface temperature and that of the vapor temperature at the outer edge of the Knudsen layer, despite that we approximated this outer edge as z=0. In kinetic approaches solving the Boltzmann transport equations or molecular dynamics simulations [27,70\u201372], this temperature jump is replaced by a continuous varying temperature distribution over the Knudsen layer and hence there may be no apparent temperature jump at physical liquid-vapor interface. However, sometimes one can still discern a small temperature discontinuity at the liquid-vapor interface. This is because the angular distribution of the evaporated molecules is usually assumed to be Maxwellian, i.e., isotropic, which is qualitatively different from the distributions of the molecules near the interface. This asymmetric can lead to the equivalent temperature of the vapor phase different from that of the liquid. The interfacial temperature drop in our heat flux equation represented by Eq. (27) includes this temperature drop as well as the temperature drop throughout the Knudsen layer."

            "text": "Evaporation or condensation on a single flat interface forms the foundation to many relevant phase-change problems. Ytrehus [21] assumed that there are three groups of molecules: emitted that is determined by the surface temperature, and another forward going flux depending on temperature outside the Knudsen layer multiplied by a coefficient due to reflection of incoming molecules, and a backward flux. He used the moments of the BTE to arrive at equations determining the unknown coefficients. His treatment did not consider the influence of the transport in the bulk region, which is assumed to be of zero gradient. Pao [15] studied the half space problem via solving the integral form of the BTE, assuming a linear temperature distribution far away from the interface. He showed that the problem is identical to the case of rarefied gas conduction when flow is zero: reducing to two integral equations.\nIn certain sense, the way we established the interfacial conditions contains the Ytrehus picture of three different streams of molecules: emitted, incoming from the bulk region, and reflected,\nalthough we assumed ballistic transport in the Knudsen layer, and the scattering effect is only implied from the molecular distribution given in Eq. (12). Since Eq. (12) is also the foundation for transport in the bulk region, the interfacial conditions we established enable us to connect to different transport conditions in the continuum region. Here, we will first consider evaporation and condensation above a liquid film so that we can compare with previous experiments. We will then connect typical heat transfer measurement, which usually reports an overall evaporation heat transfer coefficient, to the interfacial discontinuities. We assume that the water layer thickness is fixed, i.e., there is water supply to the layer in case of evaporation and extraction from the layer in case of condensation. We assume the water layer is thick enough so we can neglect the disjoining pressure. We also assume that the absorption of the latent heat happens in the liquid phase and right at the surface, although as discussed in Sec. 2, heat is absorbed over a certain distance close to the interfacial region when molecules move from inside the bulk liquid to the surface region."

            "text": "Experiment Ward and co-workers carried out pioneering experiments demonstrating temperature discontinuities at a water-vapor interface [7,8]. In their experiment, the evaporation rate is controlled externally by a vacuum pump. They measured that the liquid side temperature is lower than the vapor side. Badam et al. [9] conducted similar measurements, with additional data showing even larger temperature discontinuity when the vapor phase is heated. They listed more details of their experiments, including the liquid and vapor side heat fluxes, although the vapor side heat flux is calculated from a model. I will focus on comparing with Badam et al.\u2019s experiment because of their more detailed information and the fact that their interface is flat, while the liquid-vapor interface is curved in Ward and co-workers\u2019s experiments.\nAs shown in Fig. 3(a), we can divide the problem into three regions: the bulk vapor region (region I), the interfacial region (region II), and the liquid film (region III). We first consider the bulk region, for which Eqs. (13)-(17) are applicable. In a typical experimental configuration, the\npressure above the surface is kept at certain value \ud835\udc435,R using a vacuum pump. So, the boundary condition can be written as\n\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc515 , \ud835\udc435 = \ud835\udc435,R (33)\nWe first consider transport in the bulk vapor phase. From Eq. (17) and considering that the relaxation time expression dependence on density\n\ud835\udf0f = # $\u221a,HW&5./\n(34)\nwe see that thermal conductivity depends T1/2. In Eq. (34), a is the diameter of the molecule. To include this temperature dependence, we can rewrite Eq.

(13) clearly shows that the mass flux depends not only on the bulk motion \ud835\udf0cR\ud835\udc62R, but also diffusion due to density and temperature gradients.\nWe now relate the mass flux ?\u0307? and heat flux q in the above equations to the interfacial region and the liquid region. In the liquid side, the heat flux that must be taken away is\n\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc58> (50(#(M)\nB \u2212 ?\u0307?\ud835\udc3f (39)\nwhere Tw is the wall temperature. The first term is heat conduction from the wall to the interface (positive for evaporation and negative for condensation), since the convective heat flux due to liquid flowing in (evaporation) or out (condensation) is small (see SM, Sec. 4 for further justification). The second term is the heat absorbed from liquid-phase due to evaporation, which we assume happens right at the interface. This heat flux should equal to the heat flux carried out\nby the vapor phase, i.e., the same q used in Eq. (35). The same heat flux goes through interface, which can be represented by one of Eqs. (25-28).\nIn a typical experiment, Ts, \ud835\udc435,R are usually known. The unknowns include q, ?\u0307?, \ud835\udc62R, \ud835\udc475(0), \ud835\udf0c5(0), \ud835\udc47>(0), \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc475,R [Eq.(16) always holds due to continuity and ideal gas law will connect r, P, and T at the same location]. Since \ud835\udf0c; corresponds to the saturation density, it can be found either from the steam table or the Clausius-Clapeyron equation once Tl(0) is known. We can use Eqs. (16), (21), (27), (32), (36), (37), and (39), or their alternatives in terms of pressure, to solve for the seven unknows. The problem is well-defined.\nComparison with Badam et al.\u2019s experiments [9] can be done without solving all the above equations simultaneously, since they have listed the liquid and vapor side heat fluxes. As their vapor side heat flux was calculated, we will use liquid side heat flux qw only. The qw is essentially the conductive heat flux, i.e., the first term in Eq. (39). Equating Eq. (39) with Eq. (27), we have\n\ud835\udc5eZ \u2212 ?\u0307?\ud835\udc3f = ,?(#(M)#\u0307 + + ,/ ,0/ %,? $+ &$(M) *($(M) [\ud835\udc47>(0) \u2212 \ud835\udc475(0)] (40)\nBadam et al.\u2019s experiments include two scenarios: the vapor phase is heated or not heated. Equation (40) applies for both cases. Figure 3(b) compares the interfacial temperature jump DT= \ud835\udc47>(0) \u2212 \ud835\udc475(0) calculated based on Eq. (40) for both cases, using the measured ?\u0307? and Tl in the Badam et al. experiment, and a as a fitting parameter. The interfacial conditions we use here can well explain the large measured interfacial temperature jump. The accommodation coefficient is not far from one.\nIn Fig. 3(c), we also show the temperature distributions in the liquid and the vapor phase. The temperature distribution in the vapor phase is obtained from Eq. (36). Although my calculation shows similar trend as observed in the experiment, in terms of interfacial temperature jump and temperature distribution trends reversal between the liquid and the vapor phases, the comparison with Badam et al.\u2019s data is not perfect on the vapor temperature distributions. This\nis understandable since their heater is only 3 mm away from the interface and the heater seems to be made of wires to allow vapor to escape. It is unlikely that transport in the vapor-phase is one-dimensional as we assume here, and the heater region might be much hotter than measured in between heating wires using a thermocouple, as Fig.3(c) suggests.\nAlthough the fact that the measured and simulated temperature distribution seems to be counter-intuitive: the vapor temperature is higher than the liquid interface temperature and heat conducts from both the vapor and the liquid sides to the interface, it is consistent with the fact that evaporation leads to cooling. In the experiments of both Badam et al.[9] and Ward and coworkers [7,8], the liquid layers are thick (~mm range), so the first term in Eq. (39) is not sufficient to supply heat needed for evaporation. Hence, heat conducts from the vapor phase to the liquidvapor interface. The higher is the evaporation rate, the more heat needs to be supplied from the vapor side, and the larger is the interface temperature jump. This is particularly true in Badam et al.\u2019s experiment when the vapor phase is actually heated. We will show next that in typical heat transfer situations when the liquid layer is thin and wall is heated, the liquid side temperature will be higher than the vapor side. The different trends of the interfacial heat flow were considered a puzzle but are really due to relative magnitudes of liquid heat supply vs. latent heat needed for evaporation, i.e., the two terms in Eq. (39), which determine the sign of q, i.e., if the vapor phase transfers heat to the interface or takes away heat from the interface."

            "text": "In evaporation or condensation heat transfer, one often uses a heat transfer coefficient, ht, neglecting details between the liquid and the vapor phases. The heat transfer coefficient is defined based on the wall temperature and bulk vapor phase temperature away from wall (\ud835\udc47R), or the free stream temperature, i.e.,\n\ud835\udc5eZ = \u210e[(\ud835\udc47Z \u2212 \ud835\udc47R) (41)\nThe question is if we can use the measured evaporative heat transfer coefficient to infer the interfacial temperature discontinuity.\nIn typical heat transfer situations, the vapor phase transport is usually not one-dimensional as we dealt above. To resolve this difficulty, we use the single-phase convective heat transfer coefficient hs to describe the convective heat transfer between the vapor phase and the liquid surface instead of computing q from Eq. (17). With this picture, we can write heat transfer in the vapor side as:\n\ud835\udc5e = I , ?($(M) + ?\u0307? + \u210e;[\ud835\udc475(0) \u2212 \ud835\udc47R] (42)\nwhere the first term represents the enthalpy carried by the mass flux and second term due to regular single-phase convective heat transfer. Note unlike the interfacial heat flux, the local enthalpy in the continuum phase is given by the ideal gas specific heat at constant volume 5RTv/2. This situation can be treated as coupled heat and mass transport [72].\nIn addition to using Eq. (42) for the heat flow in the bulk vapor phase, we can similarly replace Eq. (13) for mass diffusion by a mass transfer coefficient hm so that the mass flux can be expressed as\n?\u0307? = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc62 + \u210e#(\ud835\udf0c5(0) \u2212 \ud835\udf0cR) (43)\nThe mass transfer coefficient can be related to the convective heat transfer coefficient by assuming a Lewis number equaling one, with the understanding that this assumption can be easily relaxed for other Lewis number values [72], i.e.,\n\u210e# = \\\" H]6\n(44)\nSubstituting the above expressions for ?\u0307? and q into Eq.

(39) and (46) to solve for q, ?\u0307?, \ud835\udc62R, \ud835\udc475(0), \ud835\udf0c5(0), Tl(0) and qw (seven equations with seven unknowns), assuming \ud835\udf0cR and \ud835\udc47R and hs are known. These equations are solved numerically. We will give some examples of the solution below.\nFigure 4(a) shows the liquid and vapor phase temperatures as a function of the liquid film thickness and Fig. 4(b) the interfacial temperature differences. Figure 4(c) shows the overall heat transfer coefficients and Fig. 4(d) the mass flux for specific sets of given conditions that correspond to typical heat transfer applications. We can see that in these cases, the liquid side temperature is always higher than the vapor side, because the liquid film is thin and can supply sufficient heat for evaporation, leading to a vapor phase heat flux also in the same direction as the liquid phase. The higher is the single-phase heat transfer coefficient, the larger is the interface temperature jump and the higher is the overall heat transfer coefficient (Fig. 4(c)). Nonideal accommodation coefficient (a not equaling one) leads to lower overall heat transfer coefficient and mass evaporation rate. For an overall temperature drop of 20 oC, the interfacial temperature drop could be 0.5-2 oC. Most of the temperature drops occur in the vapor phase.\nAccompanying the interface temperature discontinuity are also the density and pressure discontinuities [Fig.4(e) and 4(f)]. The saturation density and pressure, which are presumably the vapor properties right on the liquid surface, are higher than their corresponding values on the vapor side, i.e., at the outer edge of the Knudsen layer. At 104 Pa, the mean free path is ~1 \u00b5m and the Knudsen layer is a few times of the mean free path, which we treated as zero thickness. Although the density and pressure differences are small, they are the driven force for the mass transport. In some sense, the temperature drop across the interface can be thought as the interfacial Joule-Thomson effect. The vapor side temperature is colder due to the sudden expansion from the liquid phase to the vapor phase."

These interfacial conditions are consistently derived from the solution of the BTE in the bulk region, based on the general diffusion-transmission boundary condition we established before for interfacial transport. Three interfacial boundary conditions are derived, one is for the mass flux, which is identical to the well-known Schrage equation. The other is for the heat flux. We also derive an additional interfacial condition for the density discontinuity across the interface. The three equations can be used to couple transport in the bulk liquid and vapor regions to determine the interfacial discontinuities in temperature, density, and pressure.\nWe show that our approach can well explain the experimental data reporting interfacial temperature discontinuities, while previous modeling efforts had failed to explain quantitatively. We also used these interfacial conditions to connect the evaporation heat transfer coefficient to the single-phase heat transfer coefficient between the vapor and the liquid phase. Our results show that the interfacial temperature drop is appreciable in typical heat transfer experiments.\nIn addition to the interfacial conditions, we also present a thermomolecular emission model for evaporation, mimicking the well-established thermionic emission theory for electrons. Although the final results can all be based on the vapor-phase properties, this model gives more physical insights on thermal evaporation. The evaporation and condensation coefficients distinguished in the past literature are likely due to the strong temperature dependence of the condensation coefficient. More work is needed to refine the model for better understanding of the molecular picture of phase-change processes.\nWe should point out that our work did not include the internal degree of freedom in the molecules. Past studies suggest that we can include them by, for example, replacing the 5R/2M in the enthalpy expression with the constant pressure specific heat. We did not include nonlinear\neffect, although the SM materials provided can be used to extend the formulation to include these effects. Also, the vapor-phase is pure substance. Further work to include the mixtures, especially non-condensable gases should be conducted.\nAcknowledgments. I would like to thank MIT for its support during a difficult time of my life.

The second term is related to the correction Schrage made, although he did not take this approach. The complementary error function was also seen in Carey\u2019s book (1), although I am not sure the original source. In fact, Schrage work seems to be equivalent to setting the integration limit for vz as [-\u221e, u], while we set the limit for vz as [-\u221e, 0] . Since vz-u represents random velocity of molecules relative to the average flow while vz represents absolute random velocity, when vz<0, molecules indeed flow towards interface. Hence, the correct integration limit is what we used and the extra error function terms in (A22) appear as a consequence.

(A73), (A74) (which are two equations), together with Eqs.

Saturation Condition. We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to relate the saturation pressure and temperature: \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b $\u0302\n=\u0302 = \u2212V( U ? C 0$ \u2212 C 0= A (A75)\nFor water, the above expression is not accurate. I used the following correlation after fitting water Ps(T) using data from the steam table, \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc47) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d[\u22120.0017384\ud835\udc47* + 0.1599\ud835\udc47 \u2212 36.0032] (A76) Clearly, the above expression has narrow temperature range of validity. Sec. 5 Evaporation and Condensation at a Single Interface with Convection Above the Interface If above the interface, there are convection, we need to replace the diffusion equations in the vapor phase, i.e., Eqs. (13) and (14) with appropriate single phase convection boundary conditions. We copy Eqs. (13) and rewrite (14) as below: ?\u0307? \u2248 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc62 \u2212 U0\nV \ud835\udf0f :[ :' \u2212 U0 V \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0f C 0 :0 :'\n(A77) *VR\nAU0 \u2248 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc62 \u2212 \ud835\udf0f U0 V :[ :' \u2212 2 U0 V \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0f C 0 :0 :'\n(A78) Subtracting the two equations, we get U0\nV \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0f C 0 :0 :' = ?\u0307? \u2212 *VR AU0 (A79)\nSubstituting (A79) into (A77), we get U0\nV \ud835\udf0f :[ :' = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc62 \u2212 2?\u0307? + *VR AU0 (A80)\nSubstituting Eqs.

Based on the fact that for heat flux, we have Tv(0) in the denominator, it is probably best if we use the density as \ud835\udf0c5. There is also the choice of taking an average or using \ud835\udf0c$. The differences among the choices are likely to be small and our solution used \ud835\udf0c$."
