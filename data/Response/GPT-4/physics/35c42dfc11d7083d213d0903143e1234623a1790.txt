Impact of Different Plastic Polymers on Biofilm Community Structure: Expanding the types of plastics studied beyond LDPE and PET to include polymers like HDPE, PP, PS, and PVC. This research could explore how the chemical composition and surface properties of different plastics influence the diversity, structure, and function of biofilm communities across various aquatic environments.

Long-term Environmental and Ecological Impacts: Investigating the long-term effects of biofilm-covered plastics on aquatic ecosystems. This includes studying how biofilms might affect plastic degradation rates in marine and freshwater systems, and how these biofilm-plastic composites influence the distribution and accumulation of microplastics in aquatic food webs.

Development of Anti-Biofouling Materials: Using insights from the study to design new materials or surface treatments that resist biofilm formation. This could be particularly useful for reducing biofouling on marine plastics, which has implications for marine pollution management, and for designing more sustainable materials that degrade more efficiently in aquatic environments.

Biofilm as a Tool for Bioremediation: Exploring the potential of specific biofilm-forming microorganisms as agents of bioremediation. Understanding the interaction between microorganisms and plastic surfaces could lead to innovative strategies for using biofilms to break down harmful pollutants, including plastics themselves, in aquatic environments.

Comparative Analysis of Biofilm Formation in Natural vs. Artificial Aquatic Environments: Conducting field studies to compare biofilm formation on plastics in natural aquatic environments (such as oceans, rivers, and lakes) with those in artificial environments (like wastewater treatment plants). This research would provide insights into the influence of environmental factors (e.g., water chemistry, temperature, light availability) on biofilm development and the ecological roles of these biofilms in different aquatic settings.
