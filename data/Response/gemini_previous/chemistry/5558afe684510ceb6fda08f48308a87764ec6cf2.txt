1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) and their derivatives.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of analogs with different substituents and testing their cytotoxic activities against A549, L. major, P. falciparum, and T. brucei. This information could be used to design more potent and selective analogs for further development as therapeutic agents.


2. **Explore the mechanism of action of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2).** This could be done by studying the interaction of these compounds with their target proteins or enzymes. This information could be used to develop strategies to overcome resistance to these compounds and to identify new targets for drug discovery.


3. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) and their derivatives.** This could be done by testing these compounds in animal models of cancer, leishmaniasis, malaria, and trypanosomiasis. This information would be essential for determining the potential of these compounds for clinical development.


4. **Investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) and their derivatives.** This could be done by studying the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of these compounds in animals. This information would be necessary for designing appropriate dosing regimens for clinical trials.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) and their derivatives in humans.** This would be the ultimate goal of the research program and would determine whether these compounds are safe and effective for the treatment of cancer, leishmaniasis, malaria, and trypanosomiasis.
