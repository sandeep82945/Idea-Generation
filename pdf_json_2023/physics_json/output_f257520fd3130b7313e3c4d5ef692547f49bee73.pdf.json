    "abstractText": "Titanium dioxide photocatalysts can break down pollutants using natural light. They possess notable light stability, chemical stability, and catalytic effects, thus leading to extensive research worldwide. However, the limited light absorption range of titanium dioxide and their inefficiencies in generating and transporting photogenerated carriers hinder the enhancement of their photocatalytic performance. In this study, we employ a femtosecond laser composite processing method to create an Ag-TiO2 nanoplate composite catalyst. This method doubles the catalytic efficiency compared with the structure processed solely with the femtosecond laser. The resulting Ag-TiO2 nanoplate composite catalysts show significant promise for addressing environmental and energy challenges, including the photodegradation of organic pollutants.",

            "text": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts, owing to their cost-effectiveness, non-toxic nature, and long-term physicochemical stability, have become prominent in addressing environmental and energy challenges. These applications include photodegradation of organic pollutants [1], self-cleaning capabilities [2], air purification [3], and wastewater treatment [4]. The commendable photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is primarily due to the electron transitions between its conduction and valence bands, thus leading to the creation of highly reactive free radicals [5,6]. However, a significant limitation of TiO2 is its narrow bandgap energy (3.2 eV for anatase and 3.0 eV for rutile) [7,8], which restricts its absorption to the ultraviolet spectrum, representing approximately 4% of the earth\u2019s solar light. This narrow absorption spectrum, along with the high propensity for photogenerated carrier [9] recombination, hinders further enhancement of its photocatalytic efficiency. An optimal photocatalyst should possess a wide light absorption range, coupled with the efficient generation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. Currently, the two promising approaches for extending TiO2\u2019s absorption capacity into the visible region are band gap modification [10\u201312] and the creation of gradient microsurfaces [13\u201315]. The band gap of TiO2 can be effectively broadened to the visible spectrum by doping with metals (such as Au, Ag, Fe, and Pd) [16\u201319] and non-metals (such as N and C) [20,21] to introduce intermediate energy levels. Concurrently, doping can infuse defects into the TiO2 lattice [22\u201324], thus potentially altering its crystalline state, which can suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Among the precious metals, Ag stands out as a popular choice for doping owing to its affordability and accessibility, compared with\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1815. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14101815 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1815 2 of 13\nthe likes of Au and Pd. The integration of TiO2 with Ag creates a Schottky barrier [25\u201327], which functions as an electron trap, thus hindering recombination and fostering charge separation at the interface. Moreover, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect generated by silver nanoparticles (NPs) significantly amplifies the absorption of visible light. The creation of microstructures has been demonstrated to induce SPR [28,29] and enhance transfer efficiency. The femtosecond laser processing technique is renowned for its application in surface and internal modifications as well as the removal of various metallic and non-metallic materials. Its popularity can be attributed to its exceptionally short pulse duration and elevated peak energy density, combined with its capability for true three-dimensional (3D) processing [30\u201335]. This technology involves directing a concentrated, high-energy-density pulsed laser beam onto a localized area of the sample. This leads to material vaporization and sequential removal, thus enabling the meticulous crafting of surfaces and edges that are both complete and smooth. The resultant micro/nanostructures amplify the specific surface area [36,37]. Furthermore, this process induces the separation of oxygen within the lattice material, thus resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancies. These oxygen vacancies play a dual role [38,39]: they act as active sites, which reduce reaction energy barriers and facilitate molecular activation [40,41], and they aid in modifying the energy band structure to decrease the bandwidth. Concurrently, they foster the transformation of excitons into carriers [42] and augment carrier separation. In this study, we introduce a three-step methodology for the fabrication of Ag-TiO2 micro-/nanocomposite structures. Initially, a consistent 3D grid of micro-/nanostructures was crafted onto the Ti surface using a femtosecond laser. Subsequently, we employed hydrothermal synthesis to produce TiO2 micro-/nanoflakes with a richer array of morphologies. In the final step, Ag nanoparticles were incorporated chemically to establish the Ag-TiO2 micro-/nanocomposite structures. We assessed the photocatalytic attributes of Ag-TiO2 catalysts under varying laser processing parameters and concentrations. The findings revealed that using a processing power of 2.5 W, at a speed of 5 mm/s, and after 10 repetitions, coupled with a concentration of 3 mol/L, yielded the most efficient photodegradation. Remarkably, this catalyst maintained robust catalytic performance even after 90 min of usage."

Varied structural surfaces were realized by manipulating the processing rate, power, and time.

The treated Ti tablets were then immersed in a 1 mol/L HCL solution for 1 h, rinsed with deionized water, and annealed at 450 \u25e6C.

The surface chemical composition of the sample was determined through an energy dispersive spectrometer (Genesis Apollo XL). The laser-induced grating structure was characterized using an Olympus laser confocal microscope (OLS3000). The distribution of Ag nanoparticles on the TiO2 nanowires was assessed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100F), whereas lattice fringe analyses were conducted via a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The results confirmed that the TiO2 type was anatase, with Ag nanoparticles integrated into the TiO2 nanowires, forming a micro-/nanocomposite structure. The MB solution, serving as a representative organic pollutant, was utilized at a concentration of 5 g/L. The light source for the experiment was a simulated solar system (PL-XQ500W, provided by Beijing Princes Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Photocatalytic degradation tests were performed under sunlight intensity. The efficacy of different samples was juxtaposed, with the characteristic peak changes of the MB solution at 664 nm being verified using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. The photocatalytic reaction was initiated upon lamp illumination."

It can fabricate micro-/nanostructures by vaporizing the material surface at energy densities in the range of TW/cm2. To refine the processing para eters, we examined the influence of the number of laser scans on the grating structure, maintaining a constant laser power of 2.5 W. With a scanning spacing of 30 \u00b5m, Figure 2a depicts the surface after a single scan, whereas Figure 2b illustrates the result after 10 scans. The corresponding laser confocal 3D and profile images are represented in Figure 2c,d. As the machining duration increases, the groove depth and bottom width expand. A single scan yields a grating depth of 13.4 \u00b5m, which extends to 19.8 \u00b5m after 10 consecutive scans. Observing the unprocessed region reveals a smooth surface, with almost no discernible heat-affected zones in Figure 2a,b.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1815 4 of 13Micromachines\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a01815\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a02.\u00a0Structural\u00a0morphology\u00a0characterization\u00a0of\u00a0single\u00a0and\u00a0multiple\u00a0laser\u00a0treatments.\u00a0SEM\u00a0im-\nages\u00a0of\u00a0single\u00a0processing\u00a0(a)\u00a0and\u00a010-time\u00a0processing\u00a0(b).\u00a0(c,d)\u00a0are\u00a03D\u00a0morphologies\u00a0of\u00a0laser-fabri-\ncated\u00a0structures.\u00a0The\u00a0insert\u00a0image\u00a0in\u00a0(c,d)\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0cross-section\u00a0profile\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0structures.\u00a0\nGiven\u00a0the\u00a0significant\u00a0impact\u00a0of\u00a0scanning\u00a0speed\u00a0and\u00a0scanning\u00a0power\u00a0on\u00a0microstructure\u00a0 formation,\u00a0we\u00a0adjusted\u00a0 the\u00a0 laser\u00a0processing\u00a0power\u00a0and\u00a0rate\u00a0 to\u00a0craft\u00a0varied\u00a0micro/nanosurfaces\u00a0on\u00a0Ti\u00a0wafers,\u00a0as\u00a0depicted\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a03.\u00a0Maintaining\u00a0a\u00a0line\u00a0spacing\u00a0of\u00a030\u00a0\u00b5m\u00a0 and\u00a0processing\u00a0once,\u00a0the\u00a0power\u00a0was\u00a0modulated\u00a0to\u00a02\u00a0W,\u00a02.5\u00a0W,\u00a0and\u00a04\u00a0W.\u00a0Concurrently,\u00a0 scanning\u00a0rates\u00a0were\u00a0varied\u00a0from\u00a05\u00a0mm/s,\u00a010\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0and\u00a015\u00a0mm/s\u00a0to\u00a020\u00a0mm/s.\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0 Figure\u00a03(a1\u2013a4),\u00a0the\u00a0laser\u00a0power\u00a0was\u00a02\u00a0W.\u00a0Observations\u00a0revealed\u00a0that,\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0laser\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0 5\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0a\u00a0regular\u00a0grid\u00a0structure\u00a0formed,\u00a0with\u00a0horizontal\u00a0and\u00a0vertical\u00a0patterns\u00a0mirroring\u00a0 the\u00a0laser\u00a0scanning\u00a0trajectory.\u00a0Unscanned\u00a0portions\u00a0remained\u00a0untouched\u00a0and\u00a0smooth.\u00a0The\u00a0 absence\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0pronounced\u00a0groove\u00a0might\u00a0be\u00a0attributed\u00a0 to\u00a0an\u00a0underpowered\u00a0 laser,\u00a0which\u00a0 resulted\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0generation\u00a0of\u00a0only\u00a0some\u00a0sub-wavelength\u00a0nanostripes\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0surface.\u00a0As\u00a0the\u00a0 processing\u00a0rate\u00a0was\u00a0 incrementally\u00a0 increased\u00a0 to\u00a010,\u00a015,\u00a0and\u00a020\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0 the\u00a0etching\u00a0depth\u00a0 decreased.\u00a0At\u00a020\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0micro-/nanostructure\u00a0became\u00a0indistinguishable,\u00a0likely\u00a0 owing\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 femtosecond\u00a0 laser\u2019s\u00a0 restricted\u00a0 ablation\u00a0 rate.\u00a0Consequently,\u00a0 a\u00a0higher\u00a0 rate\u00a0 yielded\u00a0a\u00a0smaller\u00a0processing\u00a0depth.\u00a0In\u00a0comparison\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a02\u00a0W\u00a0power\u00a0setting,\u00a0the\u00a02.5\u00a0W\u00a0 grid\u00a0structure\u00a0emerged\u00a0as\u00a0uniformly\u00a0defined,\u00a0with\u00a0sporadically\u00a0placed\u00a0sub-wavelength\u00a0 nanostripes\u00a0and\u00a0micro-/nanoparticles\u00a0evident\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0spot-treated\u00a0region,\u00a0culminating\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0 cohesive\u00a0prism\u00a0structure,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a03(b1\u2013b4).\u00a0This\u00a0outcome\u00a0aligned\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0effects\u00a0observed\u00a0at\u00a02\u00a0W,\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0scanning\u00a0rate\u00a0was\u00a0similarly\u00a0elevated.\u00a0Notably,\u00a0upon\u00a0increasing\u00a0the\u00a0processing\u00a0power\u00a0to\u00a04\u00a0W,\u00a0protuberances\u00a0with\u00a0diameters\u00a0ranging\u00a0between\u00a01\u00a0 and\u00a03\u00a0\u00b5m\u00a0resulted\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0spot-treated\u00a0region,\u00a0essentially\u00a0displacing\u00a0the\u00a0prism\u00a0structure,\u00a0as\u00a0 shown\u00a0 in\u00a0 Figure\u00a0 3(c1\u2013c4).\u00a0 The\u00a0 non-lit\u00a0 spot\u00a0 processing\u00a0 area\u00a0 deviated\u00a0 from\u00a0 its\u00a0 flat\u00a0\ni t si i t i t f s i s s i r i r str - t re for ati , e j ste t e l ser r cessi er r te t cr ft rie icr - /nanos rfaces on i afers, as e icte in Fig re 3. aintaining a line s acing of 30 and processing once, the po er as odulated to 2 , 2.5 , and 4 . oncurrently, scanning rates ere varied fro 5 /s, 10 /s, and 15 mm/s to 20 mm/s. As shown in Figure 3(a1\u2013a4), the laser power was 2 W. Observations revealed that, with a laser rate of 5 mm/s, a regular grid structure formed, with horizontal and vertical patterns mirroring the laser scanning trajectory. Unscanned portions remained untouched and smooth. The absence of a pronounced groove might be attributed to an underpowered laser, which resulted in the generation of only some sub-wavelength nanostripes on the surface. As the processing rate was incrementally increased to 10, 15, and 20 mm/s, the etching depth decreased. At 20 mm/s, the surface micro-/nanostructure became indistinguishable, likely owing to the femtosecond laser\u2019s restricted ablation rate. Consequently, a higher rate yielded a smaller processing depth. In comparison to the 2 W power setting, the 2.5 W grid structure emerged as uniformly defined, with sporadically placed sub-wavelength nanostripes and micro-/nanoparticles evident in the spot-treated region, culminating in a cohesive prism structure, as shown in Figure 3(b1\u2013b4). This outcome aligned with the effects observed at 2 W, when the scanning rate was similarly elevated. Notably, upon increasing the processing power to 4 W, protuberances with diameters ranging between 1 and 3 \u00b5m resulted in the spot-treated region, essentially displacing the prism structure, as shown in Figure 3(c1\u2013c4). The non-lit spot processing area deviated from its flat demeanor. As scanning rates continually increased, the untreated surface morphed into a ridged\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1815 5 of 13\npattern, thereby intensifying the granularity of the bulge.

(c) Effect of different scanning rates on surface structure at laser power of 4 W: (c1) 5 mm/s, (c2) 10 mm/s, (c3) 15 mm/s, and (c4) 20 mm/s.\nAfter setting the processing power and rate to 2.5 W and 5 mm/s, respectively, the processing times were adjusted. Specifically, the procedure is repeated 10 times, as depicted in Figure 4. Figure 4a illustrates the expansive grid-like structure crafted on the Ti surface. This structure is consistent in size, with its height nearly mirroring its depth, and lacks the submicron protuberance that power fluctuations might introduce. As observed in Figure 4b,c, the peripheral region following multiple laser ablations is smooth and uniform. At the top, owing to the line spacing exceeding the spot diameter, complete etching was unattainable, thus resulting in a sleek, isolated prismatic structure interspersed with micro-/nanostripes. When contrasted with the standalone prismatic formation, the grid structure created on the Ti surface after 10 processing cycles boasted a more substantial specific surface area. Moreover, this structure could be crafted across a broader expanse, maintaining its smooth and even texture.\nicro achines\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a01815\u00a0 5\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\ndemeanor.\u00a0As\u00a0scanning\u00a0rates\u00a0continually\u00a0increased,\u00a0the\u00a0untreated\u00a0surface\u00a0morphed\u00a0into\u00a0a\u00a0 ridged\u00a0patter ,\u00a0ther by\u00a0intensifying\u00a0the\u00a0granularity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0bulge.\u00a0Of\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0tested\u00a0configurations,\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0pronounced\u00a0prismatic\u00a0 urface\u00a0was\u00a0realiz d\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0power\u00a0of\u00a02.5\u00a0W\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0 rate\u00a0of\u00a05\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0essentially\u00a0delivering\u00a0the\u00a0largest\u00a0specific\u00a0surface\u00a0area.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a03.\u00a0The\u00a0r lationship\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0mo phologies\u00a0of\u00a0laser-fabricated\u00a0structures\u00a0with\u00a0scanning\u00a0rates\u00a0and\u00a0 laser\u00a0power.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Effect\u00a0of\u00a0different\u00a0scanning\u00a0rates\u00a0on\u00a0surface\u00a0structure\u00a0at\u00a0laser\u00a0power\u00a0of\u00a02\u00a0W:\u00a0(a1)\u00a05\u00a0 mm/s,\u00a0(a2)\u00a010\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0(a3)\u00a015\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0and\u00a0(a4)\u00a020\u00a0mm/s.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Effect\u00a0of\u00a0different\u00a0scanning\u00a0rates\u00a0on\u00a0surface\u00a0 structure\u00a0at\u00a0laser\u00a0power\u00a0of\u00a02.5\u00a0W:\u00a0(b1)\u00a05\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0(b2)\u00a010\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0(b3)\u00a015\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0and\u00a0(b4)\u00a020\u00a0mm/s.\u00a0(c)\u00a0 Effect\u00a0of\u00a0different\u00a0scanning\u00a0rates\u00a0on\u00a0surface\u00a0structure\u00a0at\u00a0 laser\u00a0power\u00a0of\u00a04\u00a0W:\u00a0(c1)\u00a05\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0(c2)\u00a010\u00a0 mm/s,\u00a0(c3)\u00a015\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0and\u00a0(c4)\u00a020\u00a0mm/s.\u00a0\nAfter\u00a0setting\u00a0the\u00a0processing\u00a0power\u00a0and\u00a0rate\u00a0to\u00a02.5\u00a0W\u00a0and\u00a05\u00a0mm/s,\u00a0respectively,\u00a0the\u00a0processing\u00a0times\u00a0were\u00a0adjusted.\u00a0Specifically,\u00a0the\u00a0procedure\u00a0is\u00a0repeated\u00a010\u00a0times,\u00a0as\u00a0depicted\u00a0in\u00a0 Figure\u00a04.\u00a0Figure\u00a04a\u00a0illustrates\u00a0the\u00a0expansive\u00a0grid-like\u00a0structure\u00a0crafted\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Ti\u00a0surface.\u00a0This\u00a0 structure\u00a0is\u00a0consistent\u00a0in\u00a0size,\u00a0with\u00a0its\u00a0height\u00a0nearly\u00a0mirroring\u00a0its\u00a0depth,\u00a0and\u00a0lacks\u00a0the\u00a0submicron\u00a0protuberance\u00a0that\u00a0power\u00a0fluctuati ns\u00a0might\u00a0introduce.\u00a0As\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04b,c,\u00a0the\u00a0 peripheral\u00a0r gion\u00a0following\u00a0multiple\u00a0laser\u00a0ablations\u00a0is\u00a0smooth\u00a0an \u00a0uniform.\u00a0At\u00a0the\u00a0top,\u00a0owi \u00a0 to\u00a0the\u00a0line\u00a0sp cing\u00a0exceeding\u00a0the\u00a0spot\u00a0diameter,\u00a0complete\u00a0etching\u00a0was\u00a0unattainable,\u00a0thus\u00a0resulting\u00a0 i \u00a0a\u00a0sleek,\u00a0 i olated\u00a0prismatic\u00a0structure\u00a0 interspersed\u00a0with\u00a0 icro-/nanostripes.\u00a0When\u00a0 contrast d\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0standalone\u00a0prisma ic\u00a0formation,\u00a0the\u00a0grid\u00a0structure\u00a0created\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Ti\u00a0surface\u00a0after\u00a010\u00a0processing\u00a0cycles\u00a0boasted\u00a0a\u00a0more\u00a0substantial\u00a0specific\u00a0surface\u00a0 rea.\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0this\u00a0 structure\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0crafted\u00a0across\u00a0a\u00a0broader\u00a0expanse,\u00a0maintaining\u00a0its\u00a0smooth\u00a0and\u00a0even\u00a0texture.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0The\u00a0morphologies\u00a0of\u00a0laser-fabricated\u00a0structures\u00a0with\u00a0repeated\u00a0processing\u00a0for\u00a010\u00a0times.\u00a0(a\u2013\nc)\u00a0The\u00a0SEM\u00a0images\u00a0at\u00a0different\u00a0magnifications.\u00a0\nFigure 4.

            "text": "The NaOH hydrothermal method is frequently employed to produce titanium dioxide due to its uniformity, low reaction temperature, high purity, and controllable structure. To investigate the influence of NaOH concentration on the morphology of nano-TiO2 on the microsurface, hydrothermal treatment was conducted on the Ti surface without prior femtosecond laser treatment. As depicted in Figure 5, the tested NaOH concentrations were 1, 2, and 3 mol/L. At a concentration of 1 mol/L, an abundance of interconnected nanowires emerged on the Ti surface. Elevating the concentration to 2 mol/L resulted in thicker nanowires with more defined boundaries. In similar magnifications, the density of the nanowires surpassed that observed in the 10 mol/L concentration. At 3 mol/L, the nanowires transitioned into large clusters of nanosheets, thus highlighting the impact of increased NaOH concentration on the nanostructure\u2019s evolution. A closer examination of the TiO2 nanostructure generation revealed that during the hydrothermal treatment of Ti with NaOH, the primary processes were dissolution and recrystallization. This caused the Ti substrate to form Na2Ti2O5 nanocrystals, which served as the primary Ti source. As Ti atoms continuously migrated from the substrate and with ongoing nanocrystal formation, the incessant generation of Na2Ti2O5 nanocrystals occurred. Based on Gibbs\u2013Curie\u2013Wulff\u2019s law, crystal formation tends to occur in regions with elevated surface energy, leading to vertical nanostructure growth from the substrate. With further increases in NaOH concentration, Ostwald ripening occurred. Smaller nanocrystals dissolved and reformed on larger structures. This resulted in the transformation of densely packed nanowires at lower concentrations to broader nanowires at a 3 mol/L concentration. Concluding the reaction with annealing at 450 \u25e6C ensured improved contact and elevated crystallinity between the substrate and TiO2 nanowires.\nMicromachines\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a01815\u00a0

dioxide icro-/nanostructures, as illustrated in Figure 5d\u2013f. Co pared with the planar TiO2, the structure of TiO2 post-femtosecond-laser-processing resembled intertwined flower-like formations, particularly in the regions between the grooves. This resulted in a markedly increased specific surface area. When contrasting the structures formed after a single processing step with those formed after 10 cycles, the differences became evident. the nanoflowers resulting from the 10-cycle processing appear more distinct and less tangled, thus yielding a larger specific surface area. The increased etching depth from the 10-cycle\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1815 7 of 13\nprocessing might prevent excessive cross-linking, thus offering more active growth sites for the TiO2. A close examining of the individual nanoflower structures in Figure 5e,f reveals that the nanoflower configuration is more pronounced after 10 processing cycles. This enhanced definition results in an even greater specific surface area and increased contact with pollutants, thereby boosting the catalytic efficiency."

            "text": "Ag particles were integrated with TiO2 nanostructures through a reduction method to produce multitiered micro-/nanostructures. Figure 6 displays the SEM images of these samples. Notably, Ag nanoparticles are scattered across the surface of the micro-/nanostructures, clustering irregularly atop the flower-like formations. The presence of cracks on the surface can be attributed to the overlapping TiO2 nanoflowers. Given their inherent instability, these structures are prone to cracking, possibly owing to differential thermal expansion coefficients during the Ag ion composite process. Figure 6c,d provides a high-resolution local view, essentially highlighting the TiO2 nanowires peppered with dense white clusters. A subsequent EDS energy spectrum analysis confirmed these clusters as Ag particles. Furthermore, the distinctive petal features become more apparent when capturing images of individual nanoflowers, as verified with EDS, as shown in Figure 7. Notably, Ag particles display a uniform distribution over the nanoflower structures. This is likely because the structures are more distinct, and during the hydrothermal process, the number of binding sites for Ag particles increases. Hence, Ag can be distributed at the base of the nanoflowers, rather than just on their surface. An EDS elemental analysis corroborates this observation, thus indicating a pronounced peak for Ag.\nMicromachines\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a01815\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\ndistinct\u00a0and\u00a0less\u00a0tangled,\u00a0thus\u00a0yielding\u00a0a\u00a0larger\u00a0specific\u00a0surface\u00a0area.\u00a0The\u00a0increased\u00a0etching\u00a0 depth\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a010-cycle\u00a0processing\u00a0might\u00a0prevent\u00a0excessive\u00a0cross-linking,\u00a0thus\u00a0offering\u00a0 more\u00a0active\u00a0growth\u00a0sites\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0TiO2.\u00a0A\u00a0close\u00a0examining\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 individual\u00a0nanoflower\u00a0 structures\u00a0 in\u00a0Figure\u00a05e,f\u00a0reveals\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0nanoflower\u00a0configuration\u00a0 is\u00a0more\u00a0pronounced\u00a0 after\u00a010\u00a0processing\u00a0cycles.\u00a0This\u00a0enhanced\u00a0definition\u00a0results\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0even\u00a0greater\u00a0specific\u00a0surface\u00a0area\u00a0and\u00a0increased\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0pollutants,\u00a0thereby\u00a0boosting\u00a0the\u00a0catalytic\u00a0efficie cy.\u00a0\n3.3.\u00a0Synthesis\u00a0of\u00a0Silver\u00a0Nanoparticles\u00a0with\u00a0Chemical\u00a0Methods\u00a0 Ag\u00a0particles\u00a0were\u00a0integrated\u00a0with\u00a0TiO2\u00a0nanostructures\u00a0through\u00a0a\u00a0reduction\u00a0method\u00a0 to\u00a0produce\u00a0multitiered\u00a0micro-/nanostructures.\u00a0Figure\u00a06\u00a0displays\u00a0t e\u00a0SEM\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0these\u00a0 samples.\u00a0 Notably,\u00a0 Ag\u00a0 nanoparticles\u00a0 are\u00a0 scattered\u00a0 across\u00a0 the\u00a0 surface\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 micro/nanostructures,\u00a0clustering\u00a0 irregularly\u00a0atop\u00a0 the\u00a0flower-like\u00a0 formations.\u00a0The\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0 cracks\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0attributed\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0overlapping\u00a0TiO2\u00a0nanoflowers.\u00a0Given\u00a0their\u00a0 inherent\u00a0instability,\u00a0these\u00a0structures\u00a0are\u00a0prone\u00a0to\u00a0cracking,\u00a0possibly\u00a0owing\u00a0to\u00a0differential\u00a0 thermal\u00a0expansion\u00a0coefficients\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0Ag\u00a0ion\u00a0composite\u00a0process.\u00a0Figure\u00a06c,d\u00a0provides\u00a0 a\u00a0high-resolution\u00a0local\u00a0view,\u00a0essentially\u00a0highlighting\u00a0the\u00a0TiO2\u00a0nanowires\u00a0peppered\u00a0with\u00a0 dense\u00a0white\u00a0clusters.\u00a0A\u00a0subsequent\u00a0EDS\u00a0energy\u00a0spectrum\u00a0analysis\u00a0confirmed\u00a0these\u00a0clusters\u00a0as\u00a0Ag\u00a0particles.\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0 the\u00a0distinctive\u00a0petal\u00a0 features\u00a0become\u00a0more\u00a0apparent\u00a0 when\u00a0capturing\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0individual\u00a0nanoflowers,\u00a0as\u00a0verified\u00a0with\u00a0EDS,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a07.\u00a0Notably,\u00a0Ag\u00a0particles\u00a0display\u00a0a\u00a0uniform\u00a0distribution\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0nanoflower\u00a0structures.\u00a0 This\u00a0is\u00a0likely\u00a0because\u00a0the\u00a0structures\u00a0are\u00a0more\u00a0distinct,\u00a0and\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0hydrothermal\u00a0process,\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0binding\u00a0sites\u00a0for\u00a0Ag\u00a0particles\u00a0increases.\u00a0Hence,\u00a0Ag\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0distributed\u00a0 at\u00a0the\u00a0base\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0nanoflowers,\u00a0rather\u00a0than\u00a0just\u00a0on\u00a0their\u00a0surface.\u00a0An\u00a0EDS\u00a0elemental\u00a0analysis\u00a0 corroborates\u00a0this\u00a0observation,\u00a0thus\u00a0indicating\u00a0a\u00a0pronounced\u00a0peak\u00a0for\u00a0Ag.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a06.\u00a0(a\u2013d)\u00a0SEM\u00a0of\u00a0Ag-TiO2\u00a0surface\u00a0topography\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0laser-fabricated\u00a0microstructure.\u00a0Figure 6.

(e) XRD spectrum of Ti plate, S-TiO2, nano-TiO2, and Ag-TiO2, respectively.\nFor clarity in descriptions, the unprocessed flat titanium sheet is labeled as Ti; the TiO2 structured with a micro-/nanogrid post-femtosecond-laser-processing is labeled as S-TiO2; the TiO2 surface treated with the NaOH hydrothermal method is labeled as nano-TiO2; and following these treatments, TiO2 combined with Ag nanoparticles is labeled as Ag-TiO2. Figure 7e shows the XRD test results of untreated titanium plates, after laser treatment, after hydrothermal reaction, and after compounding Ag nanoparticles, named Ti, S-TiO2, nanoTiO2, and Ag-TiO2, respectively. The untreated titanium plates showed peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 40.16 (101), 52.98 (102), 70.63 (103), and 76.19 (112), respectively. Rutile TiO2 appeared after laser processing and the corresponding peaks appeared at 27.4 (110), 36.1 (101), and 54.36 (111). The crystal phase of TiO2 after the hydrothermal reaction includes both the rutile phase with a 2\u03b8 value of 48.18 (200) and the anatase phase with a 2\u03b8 value of 24.8 (101). The two crystalline types of TiO2 after the hydrothermal reaction were mixed together for a better catalytic effect. Finally, regarding composite Ag nanoparticles, the peak positions of Ag appeared on the corresponding spectra with 2\u03b8 values of 44.22 (200), 64.46 (220), and 77.32 (311). According to the above XRD results, bits of rutile TiO2 would be formed on the surface of laser-fabricated microstructures. Then, anatase TiO2 would be synthesized with a hydrothermal reaction. Also, Ag nanoparticles can be decorated on the surface of TiO2 flower-like structures. TEM and HRTEM analyses of Ag-TiO2-10 reveal that the surface of the TiO2 flower-like structure is closely bound to Ag nanoparticles with diameters ranging between 5 and 8 nm\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1815 9 of 13\n(in Figure 8). This observation aligns with the findings from the EDS results. The HRTEM image presented in Figure 8b highlights two distinct lattice stripe spacings: 0.357 nm and 0.285 nm. These measurements correspond to the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2 and the (102) crystal plane of Ag, respectively. This evidence further confirms that the TiO2 produced via the hydrothermal method is of the anatase phase.\nMicromachines\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a01815\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0

The p otocatalytic degradation capabilities of various samples were assessed by evaluating the degradation of the MB solution under simulated sunlight. Figure 9a presents the ultraviolet\u2013visible light absorption spectra of the B solution hen subjected to g-Ti 2 over varying durations. s the irradiation ti e increased, the characteristic absorption peak of the B solution at 664 n decreased, thus suggesting that Ag-TiO2 can catalyze\nB solution degradation under simulated sunlight. TiO2 with a flat surface structure exhibited negligible catalytic degradation of MB when exposed to sunlight. In this study, the femtosecond laser processing technology created abundant micro-/nanosurface structures on S-TiO2, amplifying the contact area between TiO2 and the MB solution and thereby enhancing the material\u2019s photocatalytic degradation capability. Introducing Ag to the structure reduced the bandgap energy and expanded the catalytic effect into the visible spectrum. Simultaneously, since the atomic radius of Ag significantly surpasses that of Ti, the interface primarily comprised Ag-O-Ti. The Fermi level of Ag is below that of TiO2, enabling the photogenerated electrons in TiO2 to be injected into Ag during the photocatalytic reaction. This electron transfer diminishes the chance of electron\u2013hole recombination in TiO2, bolstering its photocatalytic efficacy. Figure 9b displays the absorption spectra of various samples after 90 min in the MB solution. Since the Ti sheet has a negligible degradation effect on MB, Ti can be used as a reference. As shown in Figure 9b, the catalytic degradation effect of S-TiO2 is superior to that of the Ti plate. S-TiO2 has a catalytic effect on MB due to the formation of micro-nanostructures on the surface after femtosecond laser processing, which are accompanied with secondary micro-nanoparticles on the surface of the structural units, resulting in an increase in the specific surface area. Nano-TiO2 is based on S-TiO2 to prepare uniform TiO2 nanosheets to form a 3D structure, which increases the contact area with MB and therefore enhances the catalytic effect. Ag-TiO2 corresponds to the highest peak absorbance because the doping of Ag nanoparticles increases the band gap and the catalytic effect is no longer confined to the UV region but expands to the visible region, thus providing the best catalytic effect. Evidently, Ag-TiO2 demonstrated the most potent catalytic performance. The dual effects significantly augmented the photocatalytic performance of Ag-TiO2, registering the lowest absorption peak within the same timeframe.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1815 10 of 13\nMicromachines\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a01815\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\naugmented\u00a0the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0Ag-TiO2,\u00a0registering\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0absorption\u00a0 peak\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0timeframe.\u00a0 The\u00a0absorbance\u00a0test\u00a0indicates\u00a0the\u00a0above\u00a0conclusion\u00a0well,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a010.\u00a0The\u00a0 untreated\u00a0 titanium\u00a0plate\u00a0has\u00a0 the\u00a0 lowest\u00a0 absorbance,\u00a0 so\u00a0 the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0 effect\u00a0 is\u00a0 the\u00a0 worst.\u00a0After\u00a0laser\u00a0processing,\u00a0the\u00a0titanium\u00a0plate\u00a0is\u00a0rich\u00a0in\u00a0micro-\u00a0and\u00a0nanostructures,\u00a0and\u00a0 due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0geometrical\u00a0light\u00a0trapping\u00a0effect\u00a0and\u00a0equivalent\u00a0refractive\u00a0index\u00a0effect,\u00a0the\u00a0absorbance\u00a0is\u00a0significantly\u00a0enhanced,\u00a0so\u00a0the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0effect\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0improved.\u00a0Then,\u00a0after\u00a0 the\u00a0hydrothermal\u00a0reaction,\u00a0 the\u00a0TiO2\u00a0crystal\u00a0phase\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0sample\u00a0was\u00a0 further\u00a0enriched,\u00a0but\u00a0at\u00a0 the\u00a0same\u00a0 time,\u00a0 the\u00a0geometric\u00a0 light\u00a0 trapping\u00a0effect\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0shortwave\u00a0region\u00a0was\u00a0affected,\u00a0so\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0absorbance\u00a0of\u00a0S-TiO2\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0shortwave\u00a0region\u00a0and\u00a0an\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0long-wave\u00a0region\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0that\u00a0of\u00a0nano-TiO2.\u00a0 The\u00a0feedback\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0effect\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0a\u00a0slight\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0short-wave\u00a0region\u00a0 and\u00a0an\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0long-wave\u00a0region.\u00a0Finally,\u00a0Ag\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0were\u00a0compounded,\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0best\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0effect\u00a0was\u00a0obtained\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0characteristic\u00a0absorption\u00a0peaks\u00a0of\u00a0 Ag,\u00a0i.e.,\u00a0the\u00a0absorption\u00a0enhancement\u00a0brought\u00a0about\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0localized\u00a0plasma\u00a0resonance\u00a0 absorption.\u00a0According\u00a0to\u00a0Figure\u00a010,\u00a0Ag-TiO2\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0laser-processed\u00a0sample\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0higher\u00a0 absorbance\u00a0than\u00a0other\u00a0samples.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a09.\u00a0Photocatalytic\u00a0ability\u00a0test.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Absorption\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0MB\u00a0solution\u00a0 in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0Ag-\nTiO2\u00a0at\u00a0different\u00a0light\u00a0times.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Absorption\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0MB\u00a0solutions\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0Ti\u00a0plate,\u00a0S-\nTiO2,\u00a0nano-TiO2,\u00a0and\u00a0Ag-TiO2\u00a0after\u00a090\u00a0min.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a010.\u00a0The\u00a0absorbance\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0different\u00a0 treated\u00a0samples,\u00a0 including\u00a0untreated\u00a0Ti\u00a0plate,\u00a0S-TiO2,\u00a0 nano-TiO2,\u00a0and\u00a0Ag-TiO2.\u00a0\nFigure 9.

(b) Absorption spectra of MB solutions in the presence of Ti plate, S-TiO2, nano-TiO2, and Ag-TiO2 after 90 min.\nThe absorbance test indicates the above conclusion well, as shown in Figure 10. The untreated titanium plate has the lowest absorbance, so the photocatalytic effect is the worst. After laser processing, the titanium plate is rich in micro- and nanostructures, and due to the geometrical light trapping effect and equivalent refractive index effect, the absorbance is significantly enhanced, so the photocatalytic effect is also improved. Then, after the hydrothermal reaction, the TiO2 crystal phase on the surface of the sample was further enriched, but at the same time, the geometric light trapping effect in the short-wave region was affected, so that the absorbance of S-TiO2 had a decrease in the short-wave region and an increase in the long-wave region compared with that of nano-TiO2. The feedback on the photocatalytic effect is also a slight decrease in the short-wave region and an increase in the long-wave region. Finally, Ag nanoparticles were compounded, and the best photocatalytic effect was obtained due to the characteristic absorption peaks of Ag, i.e., the absorption enhancement brought about with the localized plasma resonance absorption. According to Figure 10, Ag-TiO2 on the laser-processed sample has a higher absorbance than other samples.\nMicromachines\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a01815\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\naugmented\u00a0the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0Ag-TiO2,\u00a0registering\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0absorption\u00a0 peak\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0timeframe.\u00a0 The\u00a0absorbance\u00a0test\u00a0indicates\u00a0the\u00a0above\u00a0conclusion\u00a0well,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a010.\u00a0The\u00a0 untreated\u00a0 titanium\u00a0plate\u00a0has\u00a0 the\u00a0 lowest\u00a0 absorbance,\u00a0 so\u00a0 the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0 effect\u00a0 is\u00a0 the\u00a0 worst.\u00a0After\u00a0laser\u00a0processing,\u00a0the\u00a0titanium\u00a0plate\u00a0is\u00a0rich\u00a0in\u00a0micro-\u00a0and\u00a0nanostructures,\u00a0and\u00a0 due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0geometrical\u00a0light\u00a0trapping\u00a0effect\u00a0and\u00a0equivalent\u00a0refractive\u00a0index\u00a0effect,\u00a0the\u00a0absorbance\u00a0is\u00a0significantly\u00a0enhanced,\u00a0so\u00a0the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0effect\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0improved.\u00a0Then,\u00a0after\u00a0 the\u00a0hydrothermal\u00a0reaction,\u00a0 the\u00a0TiO2\u00a0crystal\u00a0phase\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0sample\u00a0was\u00a0 further\u00a0enriched,\u00a0but\u00a0at\u00a0 the\u00a0same\u00a0 time,\u00a0 the\u00a0geometric\u00a0 light\u00a0 trapping\u00a0effect\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0shortwave\u00a0region\u00a0was\u00a0affected,\u00a0so\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0absorbance\u00a0of\u00a0S-TiO2\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0shortwave\u00a0region\u00a0and\u00a0an\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0long-wave\u00a0region\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0that\u00a0of\u00a0nano-TiO2.\u00a0 The\u00a0feedback\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0effect\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0a\u00a0slight\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0short-wave\u00a0region\u00a0 and\u00a0an\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0long-wave\u00a0region.\u00a0Finally,\u00a0Ag\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0were\u00a0compounded,\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0best\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0effect\u00a0was\u00a0obtained\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0characteristic\u00a0absorption\u00a0peaks\u00a0of\u00a0 Ag,\u00a0i.e.,\u00a0the\u00a0absorption\u00a0enhancement\u00a0brought\u00a0about\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0localized\u00a0plasma\u00a0resonance\u00a0\nabsorption.\u00a0According\u00a0to\u00a0Figure\u00a010,\u00a0Ag-TiO2\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0laser-processed\u00a0sample\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0higher\u00a0\nabsorbance\u00a0than\u00a0other\u00a0samples.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Fi ur \u00a09.\u00a0Photocatalytic\u00a0ability\u00a0test.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Abs rption\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0MB\u00a0solution\u00a0 in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0AgTiO2\u00a0at\u00a0different\u00a0light\u00a0times.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Absorption\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0MB\u00a0solutions\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0Ti\u00a0plate,\u00a0STiO2,\u00a0nano-TiO2,\u00a0and\u00a0Ag-TiO2\u00a0after\u00a090\u00a0min.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a010.\u00a0The\u00a0absorbance\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0different\u00a0 treated\u00a0samples,\u00a0 including\u00a0untreated\u00a0Ti\u00a0plate,\u00a0S-TiO2,\u00a0 nano-TiO2,\u00a0and\u00a0Ag-TiO2.\u00a0 Fig re 10. e absorba ce of t e iffere t treate sa les, i cl i g treate i late, S- i 2, nano-TiO2, and Ag-TiO2.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1815 11 of 13"

            "text": "In this study, an Ag-TiO2 nanoplate composite catalyst was synthesized via a threestage procedure, and its photocatalytic efficiency was subsequently evaluated. Utilizing femtosecond laser processing, micro-/nanogrid structures were crafted onto the Ti surface, serving as the foundation for the Ag-TiO2. By fine-tuning the laser power, processing speed, and duration, a textured surface topology emerged, culminating in a uniform prismatic structure boasting an extensive specific surface area. Following this, TiO2 was developed on the S-Ti surface via a hydrothermal approach. Variations in the NaOH reaction concentration led to progressive morphological shifts, transitioning from nanowires to expansive nanosheets. Subsequently, Ag nanoparticles were introduced onto these nanowires via a low-temperature AgNO3 reduction. The density and spread of these Ag nanoparticles can be modulated by altering the processing duration. The findings underscored that femtosecond laser processing of micro-/nanostructures enhances the specific surface area, furnishing additional reaction sites beneficial for photocatalytic reactions. The incorporation of Ag nanoparticles adeptly broadened the TiO2\u2019s light absorption spectrum, stretching into the visible light domain. Under simulated visible light exposure, the Ag-TiO2 composite photocatalyst demonstrated a tripling in its MB degradation capacity compared with S-TiO2. After 90 min, this photocatalyst still exhibited commendable catalytic prowess.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Q.-K.L., Y.W. and X.-Q.L.; methodology, Q.-K.L., Y.L. and J.-Y.Q.; software, Y.-J.W. and Y.-D.L.; validation, Q.-K.L. and Y.L.; formal analysis, Y.-J.W.; investigation, J.-Y.Q.; resources, Q.-K.L.; data curation, Q.-K.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Q.-K.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.-J.W., Y.-D.L. and J.-Y.Q.; visualization, Y.L.; supervision, Y.W. and X.-Q.L.
