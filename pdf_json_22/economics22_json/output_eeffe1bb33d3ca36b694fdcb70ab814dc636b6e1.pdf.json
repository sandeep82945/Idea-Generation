    "abstractText": "Large-scale agricultural operations number among the ways to promote the green development of the agricultural sector, which can not only encourage farmers to adopt green innovative technology, reduce the input of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and achieve environmental protection, but it also enables production with a high efficiency through an economy of scale and an improvement in farmers\u2019 income. Based on the agricultural panel data of 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2000 to 2019, the panel autoregressive distribution lag model was used to explore the dynamic relationship between a business\u2019 scale, financial support, and agricultural green total factor productivity (AGTFP). The empirical outcomes indicate that there is a significant cross-sectional dependence, cointegration relationship, and long-run relationship between the scale of agricultural operations, financial support for agriculture, and AGTFP. Strengthening the intensity of financial support for agriculture is not conducive to improving AGTFP. On the contrary, increasing the scale of agricultural operations could promote AGTFP. In addition, the panel Granger causality test results indicate that financial support for agriculture has a unidirectional causal relationship with the scale of agricultural operations and AGTFP. The impulse response results demonstrate that reducing part of the financial support for agriculture or increasing the scale of operation can promote AGTFP. These conclusions have a long-term practical significance for agricultural departments and decision-making regarding financial distribution.",

            "text": "Since its reform and opening-up in 1978, China\u2019s economy has achieved rapid growth objectives and has become the second-largest economy and the largest developing country since 2010. China\u2019s agriculture has undergone a comprehensive and in-depth reform that has enabled remarkable achievements and has made an essential contribution to the development of world agriculture [1]. However, with the rapid growth of the agricultural economy, China\u2019s agricultural production has caused great environmental damage, and a large amount of greenhouse gases have been emitted, which are detrimental to the sustainable development of agriculture [2]. For example, from 2007 to 2017, China\u2019s agricultural fertilizer use increased by 14.71%, from 51.078 million tons to 58.594 million tons. The extensive input of agricultural production factors has caused large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and agricultural non-point source pollution [3,4]. Under the background of the current tight agricultural environment, only by adjusting the pattern of agricultural development and improving agricultural green total factor productivity (AGTFP) can we realize green sustainable development in Chinese agriculture [5]. To achieve this goal, the Chinese central government has formulated policies to promote green agriculture development that have been stated in the Central No.1 Document in 2022. At\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 9043. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159043 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nthe same time, the government has achieved positive results regarding strengthening the science and technology-based support for green agriculture, subsidizing green agriculture, improving the utilization rate of production factors, and reducing pollution. The Chinese government has also attracted an increasing number of scholars to explore the green and sustainable development of agriculture. Government subsidies to agriculture significantly reduce farmers\u2019 use of chemical fertilizers and promote green development. However, some scholars put forward different views, arguing that financial subsidies do not always promote the green development of agriculture. For example, subsidies for agricultural output can promote agricultural overproduction and cause pollution [6,7]. In addition, although the increase in the scale of agricultural operations has generally played a positive role in promoting the use of green technology and improving production efficiency, showing a clear environmental protection effect [8,9], blindly expanding the scale of operation due to farmers\u2019 pursuit of profits is not conducive to green agricultural production. Under such circumstances, it is very important to clarify the causal relationship between fiscal support for agriculture, the scale of agricultural operations, and AGTFP. For example, if the increase in the scale of agricultural operations promotes AGTFP, the state should formulate policies to guide traditional household-based agricultural production to develop in the direction of intensification. If the intensity of fiscal support for agriculture has a significant negative impact on AGTFP, relevant departments should consider how to correctly guide the flow of fiscal and monetary funds, rather than simply increasing the proportion of agriculture-related expenditures. The primary purpose of this study is to use the agricultural panel data of 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2000 to 2019 and employ ARDL and PVAR models to explore the relationship between AGTFP, the scale of agricultural operations, and financial support for agriculture. Firstly, the paper uses the SBM model, including bad outputs, to measure each province\u2019s AGTFP. Secondly, this research uses the unit root, cointegration, Granger causality, and other methods to test the core variables of this paper. Thirdly, the paper studies the relationship between three variables by using the panel data model. Compared with the previous literature on agricultural production efficiency, this paper takes the carbon emissions from agricultural production into account when calculating the index of agricultural production efficiency. Since carbon emissions are the main focus of environmental protection and there are carbon emissions in all aspects of agricultural production, calculating agricultural carbon emissions can better reflect green production efficiency. In addition, the PVAR model proposed by Holtz-Eakinetal [10] has many advantages over the VAR model and panel data. The three variables of interest are regarded as endogenous variables, and the innovative shock of one endogenous variable on other endogenous variable is analyzed by calculating the orthonormal impulse response function. Based on the empirical results, the paper also suggests policy suggestions to promote green agricultural production and improve production efficiency. Compared with the existing literature, this paper has the following three contributions: (1) this paper places AGTFP, the scale of agricultural operations, and the strength of the supporting agriculture into the integrated framework and uses the panel model to analyze the causal relationship between them, which further confirms the positive role of the scale of agricultural management in agricultural green development. At the same time, it is also observed that the overall effect of the strength of the supporting agriculture on the green development of agriculture is negative, which provides a foundation for more detailed research on the role of agricultural financial funds and the accurate guiding of financial funds in the positive direction. (2) The empirical method of this paper considers cross-sectional correlation, cointegration relationships, the lag effect, and a variety of other methods while mutually verifying the results to ensure their robustness.

            "text": "Upon reviewing the literature, it is evident that many previous works have discussed the influencing factors of agricultural green total factor productivity (AGTFP). For example, taking the opening of high-speed rail systems as an instrumental variable, in the form of regression discontinuous design (RDD) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation, Wang et al. [11] found that interregional investment can significantly affect AGTFP by affecting the number of green invention patents. To analyze each province\u2019s green total factor productivity, Wang et al. [12] used stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and Malmquist index methods. They found that the green technological innovation of the province can significantly improve its AGTFP but restrains the neighboring provinces\u2019 AGTFP. Yuan and Zhang [13] analyzed the impact of environmental regulations on the input and output of production factors and found that environmental regulation has an inverted \u201cU\u201d curve on AGTFP. However, the allocation rate of production factors can reverse the inhibitory effect of strict environmental regulations on agricultural total factor productivity. Moreover, a mix of different regulatory policies and investing in human capital more positively affect the high-quality development of China\u2019s agricultural economy. Using the three-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method combined with the Slack-Based Measure (SBM) model, Chen et al. [14] discussed the spatial distribution and changing trend of AGTFP. The results show that China\u2019s overall green total factor productivity is low and decreases from east to west. Considering the negative effects of carbon emissions, Liu et al. [1] calculated China\u2019s AGTFP using the Super-SBM model and found that the difference was caused by different agricultural factor endowments and regional characteristics. In addition, the strengthening of investment in agricultural research and sustainable development, the development of cleaner agricultural production, and the expansion of the degree of the opening-up of agriculture to the outside world all play a positive role in improving agricultural total factor productivity and promoting balanced rural development. Still, factor market distortion and inefficient production scale inhibit the improvement of AGTFP [1,15,16]. However, there are few studies of the relationship between the intensity of financial support for agriculture and AGTFP. Based on the existing literature, this paper comprehensively studies the effects of the intensity of the financial support for agriculture and the scale of agricultural operations on AGTFP. In the stable growth of agricultural production, financial support and agriculturerelated public policies play an important role; for example, research and dissemination investment in agricultural chemical fertilizer can contribute to agricultural growth [17]. Moreover, improving financial incentives can encourage financial institutions to increase loans to agriculture, reduce the income gap between urban and rural areas, promote sustainable development, and increase green total factor productivity [18]. In addition, the government\u2019s public financial investment in agricultural infrastructure, education, research, and so on can promote social capital investment in agriculture. However, other input subsidies, except for irrigation subsidies, do not achieve the goal of increasing social capital investment and promoting agricultural growth. Therefore, the government should eliminate some input subsidies and shift the resources to public agriculture investment [19]. Akbar and Jamil [17] also pointed out that the government should increase general infrastructure investment rather than public investment in the agricultural sector due to the crowding-out effect of the agricultural sector. In addition, increasing credit support for agriculture and financial support for policy promotion can promote the use of green agricultural technologies and the development of green agriculture [20\u201322]. Whether China\u2019s financial support for agriculture can promote AGTFP is of vital importance to the healthy development of agriculture, the reduction of environmental pollution, and the livelihoods of developing countries [12,17]. The sustainable development of agriculture can be simply summarized as meeting people\u2019s current needs for agricultural products without harming the ability of future generations to develop agriculture following the Brundtland Report (1987). However, due to the different evaluation systems, the interpretation of agricultural sustainable development\nis vague and complex [23,24]. Agricultural green total factor productivity (AGTFP) reveals a facet of steady growth that exceeds input factors under environmental pressure, and it is an accurate indicator of agricultural economic performance combined with the ecological environment [14]. Compared with agricultural total factor productivity, AGTFP takes into account environmental constraints, reflecting economic growth and environmental protection [25]. The main way to improve AGTFP and achieve the goal of agricultural sustainable development is to promote green technological innovations [12]. The innovation and application of agricultural green technology are strongly related to the scale of agricultural operations. Agricultural producers with a larger operating scale are more willing to use new technology and spend more time and money pursuing agricultural knowledge [8,26]. Furthermore, from the regional aspect, the regional green agricultural technology-related progress is higher in the generally larger scale of agricultural management [26]. The scale of agricultural operations plays an essential role in adopting new technology. Many studies show a significant positive relationship between the scale of agricultural operations and agriculture-related green technology\u2019s progress [26,27]. Their theoretical framework is as follows: unlike the smaller scale of agricultural operation, farmers operating at a larger scale can try to use innovative green technology on their portion of their land [28]. In addition, the use of some green innovative technologies requires the support of economies of scale [29]. The relationship between agriculture and the environment is inseparable and the two facets circularly affect each other [30]. From the point of view of reducing environmental pollution, the scale of agricultural operations has a significant negative influence on the intensity of pesticide use. On average, every 1% increase in farm size reduces the pesticide used per hectare by 0.2%. Therefore, measures to improve large-scale agricultural management can promote the development of green agriculture [9,31]. The appropriate scale of agricultural operation is the core factor of sustainable development. In most agricultural countries, farm-scale growth is the key to rapid economic growth, poverty reduction, and stable rural development [32]. However, it has always been controversial whether the larger or smaller scale of agricultural operations should be adopted. Some studies have found that the smaller scale of agricultural operations has a higher land yield per hectare than the larger. That is, there is an inverse correlation between the scale of agricultural operations and agricultural productivity [33,34]. However, some studies have pointed out that the persistence of a smaller the scale of agricultural operations may restrict overall agricultural growth and competition. With the growth of the economy and market, a smaller scale of agricultural operations will develop in the direction of scale reward [35,36]. From the point of view of China and from a global perspective, Ren et al. [9] found that the expansion in the scale of agricultural operations has a positive role on farmers\u2019 net profit, economy, technology, and labor efficiency. However, the relationship between the scale of agricultural operations and AGTFP is not still clearly understood."

            "text": "In previous studies, the measurement of the scale of agricultural operations has been shown to differ between macro and micro studies. From a micro point of view, the scale of agricultural operations is expressed by the land size of each farm [26,30,31,37]; from a macro perspective, the scale of agricultural operation is expressed by the per capita cultivated land area of each region or the sown area of each agricultural laborer [26,31]. Due to historical reasons for agricultural production, China has still been dominated by small-scale peasant production for the past 20 years, but it is also transforming some operations into forms of large-scale farm production [38,39]. Based on the above practical reasons, it is better to explore the impact of per capita cultivated land or per capita sown area on the agricultural green total factor productivity from a macro perspective than to use micro-farm data. Considering that the agricultural sown area is the actual land input of agricultural production, and the employed population of the primary industry is the human resource input of agricultural production, the agricultural operating area of this\npaper is represented by the per capita agricultural sown area. The value is the ratio of each province\u2019s total agricultural sown area to the number of people engaged in the primary industry. To ensure the availability of data and the consistency of this paper\u2019s statistical calibre, the original data of agricultural operating areas have been sourced from the China Rural Statistical Yearbook, including panel data of 30 provincial administrative regions from 2000 to 2019."

            "text": "Previous studies have generally used the absolute amount of governmental expenditure related to agriculture, such as government subsidies for agricultural irrigation and agricultural research expenditure or per capita fiscal spending in agriculture, when calculating agriculture-related fiscal expenditure [19,40]. This type of analysis does not take into account the relative changes in agriculture-related fiscal expenditure. To study the influence of the change in financial support for agriculture on AGTFP, this paper uses the ratio of agriculture-related expenditure to the total financial expenditure to express the intensity of financial support for agriculture. The original data on the financial support for agriculture comes from China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics and China\u2019s Rural Statistical Yearbook, including panel data from 30 provincial administrative regions from 2000 to 2019.\n3.2.1. Agricultural Green Total Factor Productivity (AGTFP)\nStochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) are mainly used in the literature on calculating green total factor productivity. Wang et al. (2021) [12] used SFA and the Malmquist index method to estimate the green total factor productivity of provinces in China. However, few researchers use the SFA method to study AGTFP because the SFA method must set the probability distribution from a random error term; additionally, the frontier production function is affected by individual regions [41,42]. Compared with SFA, as a nonparametric method, DEA does not need to set specific production functions and inefficiency items in advance and is almost free from subjective influence [14]. Therefore, researchers regard data processed through DEA as the main measure of green total factor productivity [1]. Considering that the DEA model has shown its reliability and effectiveness in the extensive research of AGTFP [1,14,15] and the characteristics of multi-input and multi-output in agricultural production, this paper uses the DEA model. Since agricultural production will produce a variety of pollutants such as carbon emissions, we use an unexpected output as part of the output variable to test agricultural production efficiency, which is called agricultural total factor productivity, denoted herein as AGTFP. The Undesirable Output Model in the application DEA-SloverPro has two variants: Bad-Output and Non-Separable models. This Bad-output model can deal with expected and unexpected outputs. This paper uses the Bad-output model to measure AGTFP. The Bad-output model based on the SBM model modification is a special SBM model with an undesirable output, and based on the variable returns to the scale, the process of using the Undesirable Output model can be expressed as follows.\nP = {( x, yg, yb ) |x \u2265 X\u03bb, yg \u2264 Yg, yb \u2264 Yb, L < e\u03bb < U, \u03bb \u2265 0 } (1)\nL and U are the lower and upper bounds of the intensity vector, respectively, and the default of L and U is 1 in Dea-solver-pro. \u03bb is the intensity vector. To allow the efficiency of every decision-making unit ( DMU ( x0, yg, yb )) to obtain the best frontier under the presence of an undesirable output variable, the input and output data must fulfill the\nrequirements: x0 \u2265 x, y g 0 \u2264 yg, yb0 \u2265 yb and\n( x, yg, yb ) \u2208 P. The Undesirable Output Model\n(or SBM model with an undesirable output) formula is as follows:\n\u03c1 = min 1\u2212 1m \u2211 m i=1\ns\u2212i xi0\n1+ 1s1+s2\n( \u2211 s1 r=1\nsgr ygr0 +\u2211 s2 r=1 sbr ybr0 ) s.t. x0 = X\u03bb + s\u2212, y g 0 = Y\ng\u03bb\u2212 sg, yb0 = Yb + sb, L \u2264 e\u03bb \u2264 U s\u2212 \u2265 0, sg \u2265 0, sb \u2265 0, \u03bb \u2265 0\n(2)\nwhere vector s\u2212, sb, and sg indicate the excess quantities of input, undesirable output, and insufficient desirable output of the decision-making units, respectively. s1 and s2 represent the number of elements in sb and sg. In the presence of a bad output, if and only if \u03c1 = 0, s\u2212 = 0, sb = 0, sg = 0, then the production efficiency can reach the optimal frontier domains. However, if 0 < \u03c1 < 1, the efficiency of the decision-making unit is inefficient. In terms of the input\u2013output model, in this paper, the expected output is expressed by the total agricultural output value after the reduction of the agricultural gross output value index. The unexpected output is expressed by the carbon emissions generated by various substances. The calculation process of carbon emissions from agricultural production will be described in detail later on. Figure 1 shows the distribution of AGTFP in each province.\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

According to the calculation, the value of AGTFP, the most critical variable in this study, is between 0.071 and 1, with an average value of 0.718 and a standard deviation of 0.166. Among the carbon sources required for calculation, the average consumption of agricultural chemical fertilizer, pesticide, agricultural plastic film, and agricultural diesel oil is 1,751,310 tons, 52,660 tons, 69,555 tons, and 638,270 tons, respectively; the average values of actual cultivated land area and effective irrigated area are 5.327 million hm2 and 2.004 million hm2, respectively; at the end of the year, the average number of cattle, pigs, and sheep in each region was about 357, 1516, 973 ten thousand respectively, and the final calculated total carbon emissions of each province averaged 6.3 million tons. The table also lists the data of the other two important variables studied in this paper, namely, the scale of agricultural operations (AGRISCALE) and the financial strength of the supporting agriculture (AGRIRATIO), with an average scale of operation of 0.602 hm2 per capita and an average fiscal expenditure ratio of about 0.092 per year. In order to computationally follow-up the model calculation and reduce endogenous problems, these three key variables were processed logarithmically. Next, we used the panel data of the scale of agricultural operations, the intensity of financial support for agriculture, and the AGTFP in 30 provincial administrative regions of China from 2000 to 2019 to analyze the relationship among them. Compared with cross-sectional and time-series data, panel data can provide large samples and reduce multicollinearity among variables, so it performs better in solving the problem of missing variables, providing more details about individual dynamic behaviors and improving the accuracy of parameter estimation [46]."

Cross-sectional correlation is the most important in panel data, and ignoring cross-sectional correlation often leads to inconsistent estimation and misleading information [48].

For long-run variable associations, we developed the following approach based on ARDL:\nLAGTFP = \u03b10+\u2211ri=1 \u03c31LAGTFPt\u2212i+ \u2211ri=1 \u03c32LAGRIRITIOt\u2212i + \u2211 r i=1 \u03c33LAGRISCALEt\u2212i + \u03b5t\n(16)\nIn the equation mentioned above, \u03c31, \u03c32, and \u03c33 represent the long-run variance of the variables. The Akaike information criteria (AIC) were used to determine the correct lag. The following error correction model was employed for the short-run variables\u2019 associations based on the ARDL model.\nLAGTFP = \u03b10 + \u2211ri=1 \u03bb1LAGTFPt\u2212i+\u2211 r i=1 \u03bb2LAGRIRITIOt\u2212i+\n\u2211ri=1 \u03bb3LAGRISCALEt\u2212i +\u2205ECTt\u2212i + \u03b5t (17)\nIn the equation mentioned above, \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3 represent the short-run changes. The error correction term (ECT) represents the short-term variance and measures the acceleration of change caused by fluctuations [64]. The error correction factor is expected to have negative and statistically significant coefficients, indicating that each shock is compensated at the next stage [65]."

They can be applied not only to the variables themselves but can also be transferred to other variables through the dynamic structure of the model. We used impulse response and variance decomposition to analyze the impact of the shock on the variables [53]. The estimation of impulse response appears in the stable adjoint matrix of the vector autoregressive (VAR) model [66], which can be written in the following form:\nyt = \u2211kj=0 \u03c6iyt\u2212i + \u03b5t (18)\n\u03c6i =\n{ Ik , i = 0\n\u2211i.

Equation (20) represents the contribution of variable n to the prediction error variance of variable m in the advance h period.

In contrast, the result tested by the PP method is unstable. When the level series of AGTFP includes a constant term and a trend term, it is tested by the LLC, ADF, and the PP method that it is a stationary series with a 1% significant level, but the result of the PP and Breitung t-stat approach is unstable. However, the first-order difference of all the variables is tested by either method to reject the null hypothesis that it is unstable, i.e., that it is a stationary series. Therefore, the unit root order of all the variables is within the first order or level series, which makes it possible to test the long-term trend between variables with Kao (1999)."

The results confirm a long-term equilibrium causal relationship between the intensity of financial support for agriculture and the scale of agricultural operation towards AGTFP from 2000 to 2019. This will help to explore the previous goals of this paper and further examine the impact of financial support for agriculture and the scale of agricultural operations on AGTFP. As shown in Table 6, the intensity of financial support for agriculture has a unidirectional causal relationship to AGTFP and the scale of agricultural operations is significant at a level of 1%. This finding implies that the intensity of financial support for agriculture may affect AGTFP and the scale of agricultural operation. In addition, we cannot reject the null hypothesis between the agricultural green total factor and the scale of agricultural operations. That is, there is no causal relationship between AGTFP and the scale of agricultural operations. This implies no obvious time sequence between the scale of agricultural operations and AGTFP."

            "text": "The Akaike information criteria (AIC) have been used to determine the optimal lag length of the model. Finally, the model, after determining the parameters, yields ARDL (1,1,1). Table 7 shows the results of the long-term and short-term relationships between variables. The long-term relationship between variables shows that the coefficient of the scale of agricultural operations is 0.576, which is significant at the 1% level, and means that for every 1% increase in the scale of agricultural operations, the agricultural total factor productivity can increase by 0.576%. This result is in agreement with wang et al. (2015) [67] on the scale and productivity of rice farms in China. In addition, it can be explained by the fact that the increase in the scale of agricultural operations could reduce the use of pesticides, make it easier for large-scale agricultural producers to use green technology, enable more efficient production for large-scale agricultural producers, etc. [8,9,26,31]. Furthermore, there is no single economically optimal scale regarding agricultural operations, so policymakers need to rationally adjust the scale of agricultural operations according to the development of the economy and market [36]. The ARDL results further inmplicate that expanding the scale of agricultural operations is more suitable for China\u2019s current economic development from the perspective of promoting green production. In addition, the coefficient of financial support for agriculture is \u22120.034, which is significant at the 1% level, indicating that for every 1% increase in financial support for agriculture, agricultural total factor productivity will decrease by \u22120.034%. Although this result is significant and consistent with the previous Granger causality test, its coefficient is very small. This situation is consistent with the chaotic conclusions drawn by the existing literature on the study of financial support for agricultural green development. That is, financial\nsupport for agriculture does not only have a positive effect on AGTFP by reducing the use of chemical fertilizers but also has a negative effect by subsidizing the output of agricultural products, which causes pollution through excessive production [6,7]. Therefore, this small negative coefficient is the total impact of fiscal agriculture-related expenditure on AGTFP after neutralizing the positive and negative effects. In addition, the table also shows the results of the short-term relationship between variables, and the coefficients of the scale of agricultural operations and financial support for agriculture are not significant. Therefore, we can say that the scale of the agricultural operation and the intensity of financial support for agriculture have no impact on AGTFP in the short term."

            "text": "We needed to determine the best lag order of variables before using the VAR system to treat AGTFP, the intensity of financial support for agriculture, and the scale of agricultural operations as endogenous variables for impulse effect and variance decomposition analysis. The paper uses five methods involving the sequentially modified LR test statistic (LR), Final prediction error (FPE), Akaike information criterion (AIC), Schwarz information criterion (SIC), and Hannan\u2013Quinn information criterion (HQ) to comprehensively judge the lag order of the optimal of the selected variables. As shown in Table 8, the optimal lag order is 3, and Figure 2 was obtained according to this order. It can be seen that each root is contained in the unit circle, which is in accordance with the condition of using the pulse effect and variance decomposition analysis based on the VAR model.\n* indicates lag order selected by the criteria.\nAs can be seen from Figure 3, the variations in variables include not only innovative shocks of the variable itself but also the innovative shocks of other variables. In 15 forecast periods, 95.3% of the variation in AGTFP can be explained by innovative shocks themselves, 0.54% by innovative shocks of the scale of agricultural operations, and the remaining 4.15% by the intensity of the financial support for agriculture. This result accords with the causality test mentioned above, and the relationship between the intensity of financial support for agriculture and AGTFP is more significant. Furthermore, during these 15 forecast periods, the degree of explanation of the innovative shocks of AGTFP on the variation itself decreased, which means that the contribution of other driving forces increased. However, innovative shocks to the scale of the agricultural operation and the financial strength of the supporting agriculture on AGTFP have experienced a process of an initial rise and\nthena decrease. The innovative shocks of the financial support for agriculture are negative for most of the period, which implies that reducing the proportion of agriculture-related fiscal expenditure is conducive to improving AGTFP, and is thereby consistent with the results of the ARDL model. This finding shows that the influence of financial support for agriculture and the scale of agricultural operations has a lag effect on AGTFP, and the influence weakens with time after reaching the peak. In addition, innovative shocks to the intensity of financial support for agriculture can explain 7.2% of the variation in the scale of agricultural operations, and the innovative shocks of AGTFP can explain 0.72% of the variation in the scale of agricultural operations and 3.01% of the variation of financial support for agriculture.

Although the empirical test results of this paper indicate that the overall impact of the intensity of financial support for agriculture on AGTFP is negative, it may have a positive effect on AGTFP when specific to a certain type of specific fiscal expenditure. For example, Deng et al. (2021) found that public agricultural R&D investment is the main driver of China\u2019s AGTFP improvement [68]; in Malawi, government subsidies for production factors for improving the efficiency of small-scale agricultural production are conducive to agricultural green development [69]. Within the provincial administrative regions, the impact of the scale of agricultural operations on AGTFP is negative. Hu et al. (2019) found that the smaller the scale of agricultural operation, the higher the utilization rate of the input factors in Jiangsu, China [70]. In addition, this paper mainly discusses the influence of the intensity of financial support for agriculture on AGTFP from a macro point of view, but this study still has some limitations, such as ignoring the role of the specific methods of financial support for agriculture and further research is required to explain the overall negative impact of the intensity of financial support for agriculture"

Based on the agricultural panel data of 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2000 to 2019, the SBM model, including the unexpected agricultural output, named carbon emissions, was used to calculate each province\u2019s AGTFP. Then, the ARDL and impulse response method based on the VAR model were applied to conduct an empirical study on the relationship between variables. The empirical results are as follows. Firstly, the data after the first-order difference of the three variables are all stationary series, and there is a significant cross-sectional relationship and cointegration relationship among the three variables, demonstrating that the variables may be subject to the same impact in different provinces and may have a long-term and short-term equilibrium relationship. The Granger causality test showed that there is a one-way causal relationship between the financial support to agriculture and the scale of agricultural management. Secondly, the long-term and short-term relationship between variables using the ARDL model reveals the fact that the long-term effect of the scale of agricultural operations has a significant positive effect on AGTFP in China. In contrast, the long-term effect of financial support for agriculture suppresses the improvement of AGTFP, which is consistent with the pulse effect with the three order lag. Finally, the scale of the agricultural operation and the intensity of financial support for agriculture show no significant impact on AGTFP in the short term."
