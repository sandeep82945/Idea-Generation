            "text": "In [20], Mielke studied the following non-linear parabolic system of degenerate type:\n(1)\n{ \u2202tv \u2212 div (\u03c9\u03b1\u2207v) = 0 \u2202t\u03c9 \u2212 \u03ba0 div ( \u03c9\u03b2 \u2207\u03c9 ) = \u03c9\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2207v \u2223\u22232 .\nThis system is set on (t, x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2126, where \u2126 is a smooth domain in Rd, for d \u2265 2, and is supplemented with Neumann boundary conditions. The two unknowns v(t, x) and \u03c9(t, x) \u2265 0 are scalar functions of time and space variables. The real numbers ( \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03ba0 ) are positive parameters.\nThere are two main features which are apparent in system (1). The first one is the degeneracy of both parabolic equations near the set { x \u2208 \u2126 \u2223\u2223 \u03c9(t, x) = 0 } , which of course constitutes an obstacle in studying well-posedness theory and qualitative properties of solutions. The second one is the mechanism for which the energy dissipated by the function v via the effects of viscosity feeds up the other unknown \u03c9, through the term appearing on the right-hand side of its equation.\nThe main motivation for studying system (1) comes from turbulence theory. In this context, the function v can be interpreted as a sort of shear velocity, whereas \u03c9 \u2265 0 represents the internal energy and a(\u03c9) and b(\u03c9) are eddie viscosities. As a matter of fact, we recall that the standard approach to the (statistical) theory of turbulence starts by decomposing the velocity field U of the fluid as\nU = u + u\u0303 ,\nwhere u is the mean part and u\u0303 is the fluctuating part. This decomposition of the velocity field leads to the so-called Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations, or RANS: these are a cascade of partial differential equations for u, u\u0303 and their higher order correlations. However, the RANS are not closed and a closure hypothesis is needed. Usually, this closure hypothesis takes the form of either one or two additional partial differential equations. One of the most famous examples of one-equation model of turbulence is the one derived by Prandtl [23] (see also [3], [5] and [17] for an extensive study):\n(2)\n   \u2202tu + (u \u00b7 \u2207)u + \u2207\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd div (\u221a kDu ) = f \u2202tk + u \u00b7 \u2207k \u2212 \u03b21 div (\u221a k\u2207k ) = \u03b22 \u221a k \u2223\u2223Du \u2223\u22232 \u2212 k \u221a k\ndiv u = 0 .\nSimilarly, a famous example of a two-equations model of turbulence is the one due to Kolmogorov [10] (see also [24] for an English translation of that paper and further insights, see [19] for related studies), namely\n(3)\n   \u2202tu + (u \u00b7 \u2207)u + \u2207\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd div ( k \u03b8 Du ) = f \u2202t\u03b8 + u \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b11 div ( k \u03b8 \u2207\u03b8 ) = \u2212\u03b12 \u03b82 \u2202tk + u \u00b7 \u2207k \u2212 \u03b13 div ( k \u03b8 \u2207k ) = \u2212 k \u03b8 + \u03b14 k \u03b8 \u2223\u2223Du \u2223\u22232\ndiv u = 0 .\nIn (2) and (3), the symbol Du = (Du + \u2207u)/2 (where Du is the Jacobian matrix of u and \u2207u = t(Du) its transpose matrix) stands for the symmetric part of Du. The various parameters \u03bd, \u03b2i for i = 1, 2, and \u03b1j for j = 1, 2, 3, 4, are positive real numbers, whose precise value is empirical. We refer to [8], [6], [16] and [13] for more details on turbulence theory and its mathematical models and to the introduction of [7] for more details and further references about system (3)1. We also point out that the Kolmogorov model (3) can be seen as an ancestor of the more recent (but nowadays still classical) k-\u03b5 model of turbulence introduced by Launder and Spalding in [14].\nAs explained in [20] (see Section 8 therein), we easily see that system (1) with \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1/2 represents a reduced version of the one-equation model of Prandtl, while system (1) with \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1 is a toy model of the two-equations model of Kolmogorov. More in general, one could consider the family of equations\n(4)\n{ \u2202tv \u2212 div ( a(\u03c9)\u2207v ) = 0\n\u2202t\u03c9 \u2212 \u03ba0 div ( b(\u03c9)\u2207\u03c9 ) = a(\u03c9) \u2223\u2223\u2207v \u2223\u22232 .\nThe general system (4) was broadly studied by Lewandowski [18], see also [2], [15] and [22]. It reduces to the model (1) considered by Mielke when taking a(\u03c9) = \u03c9\u03b1 and b(\u03c9) = \u03c9\u03b2, a choice which we will always assume from now on.\n1Notice that in [7], as well as in all the classical references about turbulence, the unknown \u03b8 appearing in system (3) is called instead \u03c9. Here we have decided to change the notation to avoid any confusion with the function \u03c9 appearing in (1), which should rather play the role of the quantity k in (2) or of k/\u03b8 in (3).\nIn order to see the relation between turbulence theory and system (1), we observe that the two systems (2) and (3) present the same main features of Mielke\u2019s model, namely degeneracy of the viscosity (dissipative) effect for vanishing k and energy transfer mechanism from u to k via the \u03b22 and \u03b14 terms. If the latter issue is a key property any model of turbulence should retain, the former represents instead a delicate point for the mathematical analysis. As a matter of fact, if we restrict our attention to the Kolmogorov model (3) for instance, previous results on well-posedness in the framework of both weak and strong solutions have always either avoided to consider the possible vanishing of the function k (see [21], [11] and [12], for instance), or imposed suitable conditions on the initial data to control the way k may get close to the 0 value (see for instance [4] in this direction).\nRecently, in [7] we considered a one-dimensional reduction of system (3), where of course we suppressed the divergence-free condition on the velocity field u (which is a scalar field in 1-D) and we erased the pressure term \u2207\u03c0 from the equations. Our focus in [7] was to consider initial data for which k0 may vanish in a generic way. We proved local well-posedness in H\nm spaces for any m \u2208 N with m \u2265 2, and the existence of smooth initial data which give rise to solutions which blow up in finite time. Still in [7], we introduced a toy-model of the considered 1-D Kolmogorov two-equation model of turbulence, namely (with the notation of the present paper) the system\n(5)\n{ \u2202tv + v \u2202xv \u2212 \u2202x (\u03c9 \u2202xv) = 0 \u2202t\u03c9 + v \u2202x\u03c9 \u2212 \u03ba0 \u2202x (\u03c9 \u2202x\u03c9) = \u03c9 \u2223\u2223\u2202xv \u2223\u22232 .\nAs a matter of fact, the main difficulties for proving local well-posedness and finite time singularity formation in the case of vanishing k can be already seen in equations (5), which are much simpler than the full model (3), even in the 1-D reduction case. Notice that system (5) is analogous to Mielke\u2019s system (1) in 1-D, when taking \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1 and when keeping track of the transport terms v\u2202xv and v\u2202x\u03c9 in the two equations.\nThe main concern of paper [20] was to study several properties of system (1) in the degenerate case, namely in the case where \u03c9 \u2265 0 is allowed to vanish on a set of non-zero measure. In particular, in that paper the author studied the scaling laws related to system (1), steady states and travelling fronts, existence of weak and very weak solutions for special ranges of the two parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nIn the present paper, we consider the one-dimensional reduction of system (1), which reads\n(6)\n{ \u2202tv \u2212 \u2202x (\u03c9\u03b1 \u2202xv) = 0 \u2202t\u03c9 \u2212 \u03ba0\u2202x ( \u03c9\u03b2 \u2202x\u03c9 ) = \u03c9\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2202xv \u2223\u22232 ,\ntogether with its transport-diffusion counterpart (see system (33) in Section 4). We set system (6) on the one-dimensional torus T := [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]/ \u223c , where the symbol \u223c denotes the equivalence relation which identifies the points \u2212\u03c0 and \u03c0, and we supplement it with initial conditions ( v, \u03c9\n) |t=0 = ( v0, \u03c90 ) , where \u03c90 \u2265 0.\nWe aim at proving similar results to those shown in [7] for the 1-D reduction of the Kolmogorov two-equation model of turbulence (3). More precisely, we will prove:\n(i) local in time well-posedness of system (6) in Sobolev spaces Hm(T), for m \u2208 N, m \u2265 2;\n(ii) existence of smooth data for which the corresponding solutions blow up in finite time.\nWhile the analysis for item (i) will be strongly inspired by the techniques used in [7], the result about item (ii) will be pretty different in spirit. Let us comment a bit more about this.\nAs just said, concerning local well-posedness, we will follow the approach of [7]. Namely, in order to control the vanishing of the function \u03c90, we will impose suitable regularity assumptions on\n\u221a \u03c90; correspondingly, in order to propagate such regularity, we will work with the good unknowns( v, \u221a \u03c9 ) of system (6), instead of the original unknowns ( v, \u03c9 ) . Notice however that, although in [20] the author is able to consider small values of \u03b1, namely 0 < \u03b1 < 1, for proving existence of weak solutions, here we will need to impose rather the conditions \u03b1 \u2265 1 and \u03b2 \u2265 1: these constraints arise naturally when performing higher order energy estimates for v and \u03c9, in order to absorb some terms by using the degenerate viscosity (diffusion) effect. Let us mention that it is hard to say whether there is a classical solution for parameters outside of our results. It seems clear to us that a more detailed analysis or even new ideas are required to expand the region of parameters where a well-posedness result is available. With this in mind, it is possible to see that the change of unknown \u03b7 = \u221a \u03c9 is the best possible choice: any other change of variable of the form \u03c3n = \u03c9 1/n, for some n \u2208 N \\ {0}, would lead to more stringent contraints on the values of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2. Concerning finite time singularity formation, instead, our result will be quite different from that in [7]. In fact, loosely speaking, in that paper the blow-up mechanism could be defined \u201cof Burgers type\u201d. More precisely, the initial velocity field was assumed to be odd with respect to the origin, with negative slope at x = 0; this fact, together with the vanishing of \u03c90 at the same point x = 0 (a property which is preserved by the flow) was at the basis of the singularity formation in finite time. On the contrary, in the present paper we will highlight a different blow-up mechanism, based on the growth of the curvature \u22022x\u03c9 of the function \u03c9. In the case \u03b2 > 1 we will see that \u22022x\u03c9 blows up if and only if the slope of the velocity fields becomes unbounded; whenever \u03b2 = 1, instead, one may have that \u2202xv(t, 0) remains bounded, while \u2202 2 x\u03c9(t, 0) blows up in finite time. A similar argument applies also to the case of the convection-diffusion system (see Section 4). Finally, let us also emphasize that the singularity formation appears related to a point where the variable \u03c9 = 0. In this regards, it seems to be related with regions of vacuum or cavitation.\nWe conclude this introduction with an overview of the contents of the paper. In the next section, we deal with the problem of the local in time well-posedness of system (6). The main result in that direction is Theorem 2.1. In Section 3, instead, we state and prove our main result concerning singularity formation, namely Theorem 3.1. Finally, in Section 4 we adapt our discussion about well-posedness and finite time blow-up to cover the case when a convection term is added to both equations in (6), see system (33). The main results of that section are contained in Theorems 4.1 and 4.3."

To begin with, we decide to follow the approach of [7] and work with the set of good unknowns ( v, \u221a \u03c9 ) . We will generalise this approach in Subsection 2.4 below. Our first main result of this section can be formulated in the following way. Theorem 2.1. Fix m \u2208 N such that m \u2265 2. Take an initial datum ( v0, \u03c90 ) belonging to Hm(T), such that \u03c90 \u2265 0 and \u221a \u03c90 \u2208 Hm(T) as well.

Therefore, here we limit ourselves to state a priori estimates for smooth solutions, leaving as an exercise for the reader the precise construction of smooth approximate solutions satisfying the uniform bounds and the proof of the convergence of those solutions to a true solution of system (6).\nBefore moving on, once for all in this section we fix the value\n\u03ba0 = 1 .\nHowever, we will keep track of the precise value of this parameter in the blow-up result, see Sections 3 and 4, devoted respectively to the purely parabolic case, i.e. system (6), and to the system with convective term.\nThe proof of a priori estimates is divided into two steps. First of all, we present estimates for the lower order norms, namely Lp-type norms of v and \u03c9. In the second step (performed in Subsection 2.2), instead, we exhibit bounds for the higher order norms, namely L2 norms of the derivatives \u2202mx v and \u2202 m x \u03c9."

Its control is very easy: owing to inequalities (8) and (10), one simply has\n(23) \u2200 t \u2265 0 , E0(t) \u2264 2E0(0) .\nWe now switch to the bound for E2(t).

When considering general Hm estimates, instead, a simple induction argument shows that the corresponding term has the form\nn\u03b1 (n\u03b1\u2212 1) (n\u03b1 \u2212 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (n\u03b1\u2212m)\u03c3n\u03b1\u2212(m+1) ( \u2202x\u03c3 )m+1 \u2202xv ,\nwhich, to be controlled, requires either n\u03b1 \u2208 { 1, 2, . . . m } , or n\u03b1 \u2265 m+ 1.\nWhen computing the equation for \u22022x\u03c3, we will get all the terms appearing above (where \u03b2 and \u03c3 will replace, respectively, \u03b1 and v), which come from the commutator \u2202x ( [\u03c3n\u03b2, \u22022x] \u2202x\u03c3 ) of the parabolic part of the equation. However, we have to pay attention also to the terms arising from the differentiation of the right-hand side of the second equation in (25).\nFirst of all, when applying the operator \u2202mx to the term (n\u2212 1)\u03c3n\u03b2\u22121 \u2223\u2223\u2202x\u03c3 \u2223\u22232, the worst terms appear when the operator acts onto the factor \u03c3n\u03b2\u22121, giving rise to (26) (n\u2212 1) (n\u03b2 \u2212 1) (n\u03b2 \u2212 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (n\u03b2 \u2212m)\u03c3n\u03b2\u2212(m+1) \u2223\u2223\u2202x\u03c3 \u2223\u22232 ,\nand when the operator acts always on the same factor \u2202x\u03c3, yielding a term of the form\n(27) 2 (n \u2212 1)\u03c3n\u03b2\u22121 \u2202x\u03c3 \u2202m+1x \u03c3 . In order to control the term appearing in (26), we need the condition n\u03b2 \u2208 { 1, 2, . . . m } or n\u03b2 \u2265 m + 1, whereas for the term in (27) we need to use diffusion to absorbe the higher order term \u2202m+1x \u03c3, giving rise to the condition n\u03b2 \u2265 2.\nFinally, we deal with the term \u03c3n(\u03b1\u22121)+1 \u2223\u2223\u2202xv \u2223\u22232 appearing on the right-hand side of the equation for \u03c3. Repeating mutatis mutandis the previous reasonning, after applying the \u2202mx operator to the equation, we have to deal with terms of the form\n(n\u03b1\u2212 n+ 1) (n\u03b1 \u2212 n) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ( n\u03b1\u2212 n\u2212 (m\u2212 2) ) \u03c3n(\u03b1\u22121)\u2212(m\u22121) ( \u2202x\u03c3 )m |\u2202xv|2\nand \u03c3n(\u03b1\u22121)+1 \u2202xv \u2202 m+1 x v\nplus of course other terms, which are however of lower order. The term\n\u03c3n(\u03b1\u22121)+1 \u2202xv \u2202 m+1 x v\nis the most dangerous one. For this term, we have to use again viscous effects, which in turn requires that\n(28) n\u03b1\n2 \u2212 n + 1 \u2265 0 =\u21d2 \u03b1 \u2265 2\n( 1 \u2212 1\nn\n) .\nThis requires that \u03b1 \u2265 1, being the case n = 2 the best case possible in terms of the size of \u03b1. For controlling the former one, instead, we need to have\nn\u03b1 \u2208 { n\u2212 1 , n , n+ 1 , . . . n+m\u2212 2 } , or n\u03b1 \u2265 n+m\u2212 1 .\nTo conclude this part, we observe that, if we renounce to a certain symmetry of conditions to be imposed on \u03b1 and \u03b2, the fact of taking n \u2265 3 imposes more severe requirements on \u03b1, keep in mind (28), but allows to go much below the threshold value 1 for the parameter \u03b2."

In particular, the blow up in the case \u03b2 = 1 and \u03b1 \u2265 2 is not due to compressibility of the velocity field.\nWe now present the proof of Theorem 3.1.\nProof of Theorem 3.1. The proof follows the main lines of the method introduced in [1] (see also [9]). Namely, we will prove that, assuming that the solution exists and remains smooth, then there is a finite time singularity happening at (t, x) = (t0, 0).\nTo begin with, we introduce the following notation: for any j \u2208 N, we set\nV (j)(t) := ( \u2202jxv ) (t, 0) and \u2126(j)(t) := ( \u2202jx\u03c9 ) (t, 0) .\n2Recall that, in the case \u03b2 > 1, one also needs the additional condition linking \u2202xv0(0) and \u2202 2 x\u03c90(0).\nNext, we observe that we have supposed v0 to be odd and \u03c90 to be even with respect to the origin, and such symmetries are preserved by the evolution for strong solutions. As a consequence, we obtain that\n\u2200 t \u2265 0 , V (0)(t) = 0 and V (2)(t) = 0 .\ntogether with the corresponding counterparts for the function \u03c9:\n\u2200 t \u2265 0 , \u2126(1)(t) = 0 and \u2126(3)(t) = 0 .\nNow, let us compute the equation for \u03c9 at the point (t, 0), for any time t \u2265 0: we have\nd dt \u2126(0) = \u03ba0 \u03b2\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b2\u22121 ( \u2126(1) )2 + \u03ba0 ( \u2126(0) )\u03b2 \u2126(2) + ( \u2126(0) )\u03b1 \u2223\u2223V (1) \u2223\u22232\n= \u03ba0\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b2 \u2126(2) + ( \u2126(0) )\u03b1 \u2223\u2223V (1) \u2223\u22232 ,\nwhere we have used that \u2126(1)(t) = 0 for any t \u2265 0. Integrating the previous ODE, we get\n\u2200 t \u2265 0 , \u2126(0)(t) = \u2126(0)(0) exp (\u222b t\n0 \u03ba0\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b2\u22121 \u2126(2) + ( \u2126(0) )\u03b1\u22121 \u2223\u2223V (1) \u2223\u22232d\u03c4 ) ,\nfrom which we conclude that\n(29) \u2200 t \u2265 0 , \u2126(0)(t) = 0 .\nAt this point, we differentiate the equation for v with respect to x to get\n\u2202t\u2202xv = \u03c9 \u03b1 \u22023xv + 2\u03b1\u03c9 \u03b1\u22121 \u2202x\u03c9 \u2202 2 xv + \u03b1 (\u03b1\u2212 1)\u03c9\u03b1\u22122 ( \u2202x\u03c9 )2 \u2202xv + \u03b1\u03c9 \u03b1\u22121 \u22022x\u03c9 \u2202xv .\nTaking the value of the previous expression at the point x = 0 and using (29) and the symmetry properties of the solution ( v, \u03c9 ) , we obtain\n(30) d\ndt V (1) = \u03b1\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b1\u22121 \u2126(2) V (1) =\n{ \u2126(2) V (1) if \u03b1 = 1\n0 if \u03b1 \u2265 2 .\nSimilarly, long but straightforward computations yield\n\u2202t\u2202 2 x\u03c9 = \u03ba0 \u03c9 \u03b2 \u22024x\u03c9 + 4\u03ba0 \u03b2 \u03c9 \u03b2\u22121 \u2202x\u03c9 \u2202 3 x\u03c9 + 3\u03ba0 \u03b2 \u03c9 \u03b2\u22121 ( \u22022x\u03c9 )2\n+ 6\u03ba0 \u03b2 (\u03b2 \u2212 1)\u03c9\u03b2\u22122 ( \u2202x\u03c9 )2 \u22022x\u03c9 + \u03ba0\u03b2 (\u03b2 \u2212 1) (\u03b2 \u2212 2)\u03c9\u03b2\u22123 ( \u2202x\u03c9 )4\n+ \u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03c9\u03b1\u22122 ( \u2202x\u03c9 )2 ( \u2202xv )2 + \u03b1\u03c9\u03b1\u22121 \u22022x\u03c9 ( \u2202xv )2\n+ 4\u03b1\u03c9\u03b1\u22121 \u2202x\u03c9 \u2202xv \u2202 2 xv + 2\u03c9 \u03b1 ( \u22022xv )2 + 2\u03c9\u03b1 \u2202xv \u2202 3 xv .\nThen, owing again to the symmetry properties of the solution and to (29), we infer\n(31) d\ndt \u2126(2) = 3\u03ba0 \u03b2\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b2\u22121 ( \u2126(2) )2 + \u03b1 ( \u2126(0) )\u03b1\u22121 \u2126(2) ( V (1) )2 .\nWe stress here that the previous result holds true for any \u03b1 \u2265 1 and \u03b2 \u2265 1 such that:\n\u2022 \u03b1 = 1, or \u03b1 \u2265 2;\n\u2022 \u03b2 \u2208 {1, 2}, or \u03b2 \u2265 3.\nOf course, depending on the precise values of those parameters, one can simplify further the previous expression, owing to (29).\nTo complete our proof, we now consider three different cases.\nCase 1: \u03b1 = 1 and [ \u03b2 = 2 or \u03b2 \u2265 3 ] .\nIn this case, putting (30) and (31) together, we find that\nd\ndt V (1) = \u2126(2) V (1) and\nd\ndt \u2126(2) = \u2126(2)\n( V (1) )2 .\nIn particular, we deduce the inequality\nd\ndt \u2126(2) =\n1\n2\nd\ndt\n( V (1) )2 =\u21d2 \u2126(2)(t) \u2212 \u2126(2)(0) = 1\n2\n(( V (1)(t) )2 \u2212 ( V (1)(0) )2) ,\nwhich immediately implies that V (1) blows up at some time t = t0 if and only if \u2126 (2) blows up at the same time t = t0. To see that the blow-up indeed occurs at some time t = t0, we use the previous equation to write that\nd dt \u2126(2) = \u2126(2)\n( V (1) )2 = 2 ( \u2126(2) )2 + \u2126(2) (( V (1)(0) )2 \u2212 2\u2126(2)(0) ) \u2265 2 ( \u2126(2) )2 ,\nwhere we have used that \u2126(2) \u2265 0, because x = 0 is a point of minimum for the function \u03c9(t), together with the assumption\n\u2202xv0(0) \u2265 \u221a 2 \u22022x\u03c90(0) .\nThe previous differential relation easily implies the claimed blow-up in finite time.\nCase 2: \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1. This time, equations (30) and (31) become\nd\ndt V (1) = \u2126(2) V (1) and\nd\ndt \u2126(2) = 3\u03ba0\n( \u2126(2) )2 + \u2126(2) ( V (1) )2 .\nFirst of all, we observe that, in particular, one has\nd dt \u2126(2) \u2265 \u2126(2)\n( V (1) )2 .\nThus, arguing as above, we see that a blow-up of V (1) at time t = t0 implies a blow-up, at the same time, also of the quantity \u2126(2).\nOn the other hand, as x = 0 is a point of minimum of the function \u03c9(t, \u00b7), we deduce that \u2126(2) \u2265 0, which implies that\nd\ndt \u2126(2) \u2265 3\u03ba0\n( \u2126(2) )2 ,\nand this, in turn, yields finite time blow-up of the quantity \u2126(2), with rate O ( (t0 \u2212 t)\u22121 ) :\n(32) \u2126(2)(t) \u2265 \u2126 (2)(0)\n1 \u2212 3\u03ba0 \u2126(2)(0) t .\nOn the other hand, solving explicitly the equation for V (1), we gather\nV (1)(t) = V (1)(0) exp\n(\u222b t\n0 \u2126(2)(\u03c4) d\u03c4\n) .\nThen, estimate (32) implies that also V (1) must blow up at the same time t = t0 at which \u2126 (2) blows up.\nCase 3: \u03b1 \u2265 2 and \u03b2 = 1. Finally, we consider the case \u03b1 \u2265 2 and \u03b2 = 1. In this case, owing to (29), relations (30) and (31) become d\ndt V (1) = 0 and\nd\ndt \u2126(2) = 3\u03ba0\n( \u2126(2) )2 .\nThus, we easily see that V (1)(t) = V (1)(0) remains bounded (constant, in fact) during the evolution. On the other hand, exactly as before, from the second equation we gather that\n\u2126(2)(t) = \u2126(2)(0)\n1 \u2212 3\u03ba0 \u2126(2)(0) t \u2212\u2192 +\u221e when t \u2192 t\u22120 ,\nwhere we have set t0 := ( 3\u03ba0 \u2126 (2)(0) )\u22121 ."

In our modest opinion, the inclusion of the convection term makes this model closer to problems in connection with turbulence theory.\nIt goes without saying that the well-posedness theory for system (6), presented in Section 2, applies also to system (33), with only minor changes. The control of the convective terms v \u2202xv and v \u2202x\u03c9 and of their higher order derivatives is fairly standard; for instance, one can repeat the analysis of [7].

The proof is simple. First of all, we observe that the system with convective terms (33) preserves the initial positivity of the function \u03c9: one has \u03c9(t, x) \u2265 0 for any t \u2265 0 and x \u2208 T. By repeating the computations performed in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we see also that \u03c9(t, 0) = 0 for any t \u2265 0.\nNext, we see that the convective term does not alter the symmetry of the initial data: therefore, for any t \u2265 0 one has that v(t) remains odd with respect to the origin, whereas \u03c9(t) remains even with respect to the origin.\nAt this point, we compute the equations for \u2202xv and for \u2202 2 x\u03c9. For the former term, it is easy to see that the convective term gives an additional contribution on the right-hand side of the form\n\u2212 \u2202x ( v \u2202xv ) = \u2212 v \u22022xv \u2212 (\u2202xv)2 .\nTherefore, computing the resulting expression at the point x = 0, and adopting the same notation as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we find\n(34) d\ndt V (1) = \u03b1\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b1\u22121 \u2126(2) V (1) \u2212 ( V (1) )2 ,\nwhich takes the place of equation (30). On the other hand, in the equation for \u22022x\u03c9, the presence of the convective term yields\n\u2212\u22022x ( v \u2202x\u03c9 ) = \u2212 ( v \u22023x\u03c9 + 2 \u2202xv \u2202 2 x\u03c9 + \u2202 2 xv \u2202x\u03c9 )\non the right-hand side of the expression computed in the previous proof. Then, equation (31) becomes\n(35) d\ndt \u2126(2) = 3\u03ba0 \u03b2\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b2\u22121 ( \u2126(2) )2 + \u03b1 ( \u2126(0) )\u03b1\u22121 \u2126(2) ( V (1) )2 \u2212 2V (1) \u2126(2) .\nWith (34) and (35) at hand, we proceed to consider two different cases.\nCase 1: \u03b1 \u2265 2.

We now claim that this implies explosion also of the quantity \u2126(2)(t) at the same time t0.\nIndeed, when \u03b2 \u2265 2 (recall that, by assumption, this means \u03b2 = 2 or \u03b2 \u2265 3), equation (35) simply becomes\nd dt \u2126(2) = \u2212 2V (1) \u2126(2) =\u21d2 \u2126(2)(t) = \u2126(2)(0) exp\n( \u2212 2 \u222b t\n0 V (1)(\u03c4) d\u03c4\n) ,\nwhich is easily seen to diverge to +\u221e for t \u2192 t\u22120 , by using the previous explicit expression for V (1) in (36).\nOn the other hand, if \u03b2 = 1, we have\nd\ndt \u2126(2) = 3\u03ba0\n( \u2126(2) )2 \u2212 2V (1) \u2126(2) \u2265 3\u03ba0 ( \u2126(2) )2 ,\nbecause, by (36), V (1) remains negative for all times for which the solution exists. Therefore, we deduce that also \u2126(2) blows up at some time t1 \u2248 ( 3\u03ba0 \u2126 (2)(0) )\u22121 .\nCase 2: \u03b1 = 1. In this case, equations (34) and (35) become\nd\ndt V (1) =\n( \u2126(2) \u2212 V (1) ) V (1)\nd dt \u2126(2) = 3\u03ba0 \u03b2\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b2\u22121 ( \u2126(2) )2 + \u2126(2) ( V (1) )2 \u2212 2V (1) \u2126(2) .\nFrom these ODEs, one can see that V (1) and \u2126(2) remain, respectively, negative and positive, at least for short times. Then, by using the ODEs again, we see that their time derivatives must, respectively, decrease and increase. Therefore, we finally infer that V (1) remains negative for all times, whereas \u2126(2) remains positive for all times.\nBy virtue of this property, we see that\nd dt V (1) \u2264 \u2212\n( V (1) )2 ,\nwhich again implies blow-up at some time t0 \u2248 ( V (1)(0) )\u22121 , and also that\nd dt \u2126(2) \u2265 \u2126(2)\n( V (1) )2 ,\nwhich, combined with the previous property, implies the unboundedness of \u2126(2) in [0, t0[ , or possibly in a smaller time interval.\nRemark 4.2. In fact, we have proven that, in general, it is \u2202xv(t, 0) which blows up first, and this implies the explosion of \u22022x\u03c9(t, 0) at the same time, apart from the case when \u03b2 = 1, for which explosion of the latter quantity may take place before the explosion of the former one (depending on the relative size of the same quantities at time t = 0).\nWe now present our second result concerning blow-up phenomena for the system with convection, i.e. system (33). Our main assumption here will be that \u2202xv0(0) is positive. Therefore, we will see that the blow-up mechanism is truly different from the previous one (which we have called \u201cof Burgers type\u201d) and, in particular, to the one pointed out in [7].\nThe price to pay is that, with our method, we are not able to show blow-up for the whole range of parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 as in Theorem 4.1, but we have to restrict to some special cases only. Theorem 4.3. Let \u03b2 = 1 and \u03b1 \u2208 {1} \u222a [2,+\u221e[ . Let ( v0, \u03c90 ) be a couple of functions belonging\nto H5(\u2126), with \u03c90 \u2265 0, and let ( v, \u03c9 ) be the related H5 solution. Assume that:\n(i) v0 is odd with respect to 0, while \u03c90 is even with respect to 0;\n(ii) \u03c90(0) = 0, with \u2202 2 x\u03c90(0) > 0;\n(iii) \u2202xv0(0) \u2265 0."

Then, there exists a time t0 > 0 such that the solution ( v, \u03c9 ) blows up at time t = t0 for x = 0:\nmore precisely, one has lim t\u2192t\u2212\n0\n\u22022x\u03c9(t, 0) = +\u221e .\nProof. The proof follows the main lines of the one of the previous theorem. Of course, the symmetry properties of the solutions, as well as the positivity of \u03c9 do not depend on the sign of \u2202xv0(0), so they are kept throught the evolution.\nIn addition, we have that \u2126(0)(t) remains equal to 0 for all times t \u2265 0 for which the solution exists. In particular, the point x = 0 remains a point of minimum for the function \u03c9(t) at any time t, so one always has \u2126(2)(t) \u2265 0 for all times.\nFinally, we point out that expressions (34) and (35) still hold true: recalling that we have taken \u03b2 = 1 here, we have\nd dt V (1) = \u03b1\n( \u2126(0) )\u03b1\u22121 \u2126(2) V (1) \u2212 ( V (1) )2\nd dt \u2126(2) = 3\u03ba0\n( \u2126(2) )2 + \u03b1 ( \u2126(0) )\u03b1\u22121 \u2126(2) ( V (1) )2 \u2212 2V (1) \u2126(2) .\nAs usual, we divide our proof into two different cases, depending on the value of \u03b1.\nCase 1: \u03b1 \u2265 2. In this case, using the ODE for V (1), we can compute an explicit expression for it:\nV (1)(t) = V (1)(0)\n1 + V (1)(0) t .\nIn particular, we deduce that, for all times t \u2265 0 for which the solution exists, one has\n(37) 0 \u2264 V (1)(t) \u2264 V (1)(0) .\nOn the other hand, when \u03b1 \u2265 2, the second ODE becomes\nd dt \u2126(2) =\n( 3\u03ba0 \u2126 (2) \u2212 2V (1) ) \u2126(2) ,\nfrom which we deduce, using also (37) and the positivity of \u2126(2), the inequalities\nd dt \u2126(2) \u2265\n( 3\u03ba0 \u2126 (2) \u2212 2V (1)(0) ) \u2126(2) \u2265 1\n3\u03ba0\n( 3\u03ba0 \u2126 (2) \u2212 2V (1)(0) )2\nHence, setting X(t) := 3\u03ba0 \u2126 (2)(t) \u2212 2V (1)(0), we see that the function X satisfies\nd dt X \u2265 X2 , with X|t=0 = X(0) = 3\u03ba0 \u2126(2)(0) \u2212 2V (1)(0) > 0 .\nTherefore, X(t) must blow up to +\u221e for t \u2192 t\u22120 , with t0 \u2248 ( X(0) )\u22121 .\nCase 2: \u03b1 = 1. In this case, we focus on the equation for \u2126(2) only, which becomes\nd dt \u2126(2) = 3\u03ba0\n( \u2126(2) )2 + \u2126(2) ( V (1) )2 \u2212 2V (1)\u2126(2) .\nNow, we use that, for any \u03bb > 0 and for any (y, z) \u2208 R2, we can estimate\ny z \u2264 1 \u03bb y2 + \u03bb z2 ,\nfrom which we deduce that, for any \u03bb > 0, one has\n(38) d\ndt \u2126(2) \u2265\n( 3\u03ba0 \u2212 \u03bb ) ( \u2126(2) )2 + ( \u2126(2) \u2212 1\n\u03bb\n) ( V (1) )2 .\nAs, by assumption, one has \u2126(0)(0) > 1/(3\u03ba0), there exists some \u03bb0 > 0 such that\n\u2126(0)(0) > 1\n\u03bb0 >\n1\n3\u03ba0 .\nUsing that \u03bb0 in (38), we see that the same inequality has to hold also for later times, and then for all times for which the solution exists. Therefore, from (38) again, we infer\nd\ndt \u2126(2) \u2265\n( 3\u03ba0 \u2212 \u03bb0 ) ( \u2126(2) )2 ,\nwhich immediately implies finite time blow-up of \u2126(2)."
