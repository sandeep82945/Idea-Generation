The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is:

"Extensive future evaluation of EGFR exon 20 insertions is needed to provide a basic database to help tailor treatment modalities for cancers with insertional mutations within EGFR exon 20, allowing more appropriate patients with EGFR 20 insertional mutations to benefit from afatinib therapy."

"In summary, there are no standard treatment options for patients with rare EGFR mutations, and further studies are needed to help determine treatment options for patients with NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations."
