 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of C. nutans extracts in treating viral infections like herpes, HPV, and COVID-19 in humans. The extracts have shown antiviral potential in vitro and in animal models, but human clinical trials are needed.

2. Identify the active phytochemical compounds responsible for the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of C. nutans extracts using bioassay-guided fractionation. Once identified, these compounds could be further developed into novel anti-inflammatory drugs. 

3. Investigate the mechanisms by which C. nutans extracts modulate inflammation and immune responses. This could involve evaluating their effects on cytokine production, immune cell populations, signaling pathways, etc. The mechanisms need to be better understood.

4. Formulate improved C. nutans extracts with enhanced bioavailability and efficacy using novel drug delivery systems like nanoparticles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, etc. The extracts have poor water solubility which limits their efficacy. Advanced delivery systems could help overcome this.

5. Explore the potential of using genome editing tools like CRISPR to genetically engineer C. nutans plants to produce higher levels of the therapeutic phytochemicals or introduce new beneficial pathways. This could create more potent medicinal C. nutans variants.
