            "text": "Among the various forms of nanoparticles, nanoporous materials have a special place in chemistry. Nanoporous materials are solid compounds with a pore size of 1 to 100 nm and have a very high available surface area.1\u201310 The structure of these compounds consists of two parts, the wall, and the cavity, in which the sequence of these cavities can continue inside the solid network and they can even communicate with each other within the network. High specic surface area, selectivity, shape, and size are the most important characteristics of these materials, which have led to many applications in different elds such as catalysis, rening, and separation; their role has been highlighted in nanotechnology.11\u201315 The main applications of nanoporous materials in chemistry are their use in the manufacture of chemical sensors, and as a surface for the stabilization of chemical and biochemical catalysts.16\u201318 The development of these materials in the future depends on the manufacture of engineered and controlled porous materials for the intended applications. Zeolites,19 MOF,20 microspheres,21 nanoporous carbon,14 and silica22 are the most important nanoporous structures.\nFatty acids are hydrocarbon chains of varying lengths and degrees of saturation (dual bonds) with a carboxyl group at one end and a methyl group at the other. Fatty acids are divided into two types, saturated and unsaturated. These natural carboxylic acids could be extracted from a variety of natural sources such as nuts, canola, olive oil, sunower, sesame, etc.23\nes, Ilam University, P. O. Box 69315516,\nf Chemistry, Bu-Ali Sina University, P. O.\na.ghorbani@basu.ac.ir; arashghch58@\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nThe green chemistry term refers to the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the production and use of hazardous substances. Another goal of chemists is the simplicity of synthetic methods and appropriateness in terms of consumption costs. Different and varied methods are presented every day for the synthesis of organic compounds, but nding and using an efficient, useful, scientic and environmentally friendly method is one of the most important features. Therefore, in this research, new compounds of silica nanoparticles based on natural fatty acids have been designed and synthesized, which will open a new way for researchers to use fatty acids to prepare new catalytic supports. Here, a new type of mesoporous silica composite was prepared in a simple way using palmitic acid (a natural fatty acid) as a template. We nominate this new mesoporous material as AGC-ZM-2022 (Arash Ghorbani-Choghamarani and Zahra Moradi \u2013 2022)."

The peak in the 466 cm\u22121 regions is related to the Si\u2013O\u2013Si bending vibrations. The peaks in the area of 845 cm\u22121 and 1104 cm\u22121 are also attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of Si\u2013O\u2013Si. Also, the stretching vibration in the 3420 cm\u22121 regions is related to the surface hydroxyl.\nThe SEM images of the synthesized AGC-ZM-2022 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2. The images show that the prepared nanoparticles have a uniform distribution and a spherical structure with particle sizes between 50 to 200 nm.\nX-ray diffraction is one of the analyses used to determine the structural properties of nanoparticles. The XRD pattern for AGC-ZM-2022 nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 3. The low angle diffraction pattern for AGC-ZM-2022 nanoparticles (Fig. 3a) in the range of 0.9\u20132, is agreeable with the reported XRD of mesoporous compounds in the literature.24\u201328 Due to the high-angle X-ray diffraction (Fig. 3b), there is a wide peak at an angle between 15 and 30, which is attributed to the structure of the mesoporous material.29,30\nThrough porosity analysis through N2 adsorption\u2013desorption, the IUPAC isotherm type, pore size and surface area of the prepared mesoporous sample can be accessed.

The results show that the synthesized nanoparticles have good porosity compared to similar reported mesoporous.\nThe TEM (transmission electron microscopy) images of the AGC-ZM-2022 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. The images showed a denite spherical shape.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nDifferent conditions to obtain mesoporous silica AGC-ZM2022 via palmitic acid/tetraethylorthosilicate are analyzed in this study (Table 2). To the best of our knowledge, this system has not been reported before. In the rst experiment, to a solution of deionized water (500 mL) at a temperature of 80 \u00b0C, 3.5 mL of 2MNaOH solution and 2.7 mmol of palmitic acid were added under vigorous mixing. Once the solution was homogeneous, 5 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h. Aer the end of the mentioned time, the resulting mixture was cooled down to room temperature and a white powder was obtained, which dried in an oven at a temperature of 80 \u00b0C. The obtained solid powder was calcined at 550 \u00b0C for 5 hours at the rate of 2 \u00b0 C min\u22121 but did not yield much efficiency (Table 2, entry 1).\nIn the next experiment, the reaction was performed with the above-mentioned conditions in the absence of sodium hydroxide, which did not yield good returns (Table 2, entry 2). For this reason, to improve the outcome of synthesis, the content of consumed water was reduced to 250 mL, and aer calcination, a solid powder was obtained with excellent yield, therefore, the amount of solvent has a signicant effect on the synthesis of mesoporous AGC-ZM-2022 (Table 2, entry 3).\nHowever, in the next step to evaluate the effect of palmitic acid in the synthesis of mesoporous AGC-ZM-2022, the reaction was performed without the presence of palmitic acid (250 mL H2O 80 \u00b0C, 5 mL TEOS) and no yield was obtained, which indicates the presence of palmitic acid is necessary for the preparation of AGC-ZM-2022 (Table 2, entry 4). In another experiment, different amounts of palmitic acid and tetraethylorthosilicate were investigated at different temperatures. The results (Table 2, entries 5\u20137) show that the low amount of palmitic acid and tetraethylorthosilicate is not effective.\nThe results show that by increasing the reaction temperature from 80 \u00b0C to 90 \u00b0C, no signicant change in product yield was observed (Table 2, entry 8). By performing the reaction at a temperature of 50 \u00b0C, a small yield of the desired mesoporous silica composition was obtained, and the results show that temperature is effective in the synthesis of silica nanoparticles (Table 2, entry 9).\nAccording to the results obtained from Table 2, the amount of 2.7 mmol of palmitic acid, 250 mL of deionized water, and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 5 mL) at 80 \u00b0C were chosen as the optimal conditions for the preparation of solid powder.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 2265\u20132268 | 2267"
