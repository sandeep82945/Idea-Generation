    "abstractText": "An experimental design was applied for the optimization of the extraction process of two preservatives, benzoic and sorbic acids (BA, SA), from food drinks. A simple, rapid, and reliable solidphase extraction (SPE) method for the simultaneous extraction of these two preservatives and their determination by liquid chromatography with a diode array detector was considered. Box\u2013Behnken design (BBD) was applied to both steps of the SPE process: (i) the sample percolation to ensure the retention of the totality of the acids by the silica-based C18 sorbent; (ii) the elution step to ensure desorption of the totality of the acids from the cartridge. Thus, the volume, pH, and flow rate of the sample, and the percentage of MeOH, volume, and flow rate of the elution solvent, were optimized. Sample volume and pH have a significant influence (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0115) on the percolation yield. However, no effect was recorded for the flow rate (p > 0.05). Flow rate also has no significant effect on the elution efficiency. The proposed new solid-phase extraction method, which can be easily applied to routine monitoring of preservatives BA and SA in juice and soft drink samples, included 0.5 g of C18 sorbent, 1 mL of food drink adjusted to pH 1 and percolated at 4.5 mL min\u22121, and 1 mL of a solvent mixture composed of methanol/acidified water (pH = 2.6) (90:10, v/v) used in the elution step at a flow rate of 4.5 mL min\u22121. Validation of the SPE method and the technique of analysis were evaluated, namely, the accuracy, precision, detection, and quantification limits and linearity. Recovery percentages of benzoic and sorbic acids were above 95% with relative standard deviations lower than 1.78%. Detection and quantification limits were 0.177 and 0.592 \u03bcg mL\u22121, and 0.502 and 0.873 \u03bcg mL\u22121 for benzoic acid and sorbic acid respectively. Optimal conditions were applied to commercial fruit juices and soft drinks and a minimal matrix effect was observed. This method was compared with other SPE methods using oxidized activated carbon and multiwalled carbon nanotubes as adsorbents. The yields determined with these last two were low compared to those determined with our method.",

However, it becomes\nFoods 2022, 11, 1257. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11091257 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2022, 11, 1257 2 of 18\nimpossible not to consume them, especially with the emergence of industrial ready-cooked food and the expanding availability of out-of-home meals and drinks [3\u20135]. Preservatives are food additives added to a wide range of commercial food products and have a considerable role in the food industry [6,7]. On the other hand, they must be used at certain levels because they can present a danger to the health of consumers [6\u20138]. Benzoic and sorbic acids (BA, SA) are used as food additives and preservatives to prevent food spoilage and extend shelf life [9,10]. They proved efficient in the preservation of food products especially since they are stable during food preparation and processing [11\u201314]. The maximum permitted level in soft drinks at 150 mg L\u22121 is defined by the FAO/WHO Expert Committee. The characterization of these preservatives is important, whether in foods [15], cosmetics [16,17], or pharmaceuticals [18,19], not only for the quality control of the product but also for the number of allergies for which preservatives are responsible [20,21]. As a result, regulators\u2019 institutions defined dose limits and even impose control of these compounds to protect consumers. Therefore, the food industry requires the development and validation of rapid and accurate analytical methods to verify the levels of added preservatives. To assess their levels in foodstuffs, it is important and necessary to develop effective, reliable, practical, inexpensive, and rapid analytical methods. In many cases, before analysis, sample preparation is essential to isolate and preconcentrate the analytes from the complex food matrix to increase the sensitivity of the analysis method. However, sample preparation is often the most critical part of the preservative analysis, which relies mainly on the physicochemical properties of the analytes and the composition and complexity of food samples. More than 60% of the analysis time is attributable to sample preparation and about 30% of the experimental errors are inherent to the sample processing [22,23]. In this context, several sample processing methods for the extraction and preconcentration of preservatives are applied, namely, the complexation and chemical precipitation reactions, membrane filtration, liquid\u2013liquid extraction, and solid-phase extraction (SPE) [24\u201328]. Among cited methods, SPE can be considered as one of the fastest and simplest sample preparation techniques for extracting trace-level analytes from liquid samples. It has been reported to be an efficient, ecofriendly, rapid, and economical technique [29\u201333]. When this method is optimized with experimental design methodology, it gives precise, accurate, and reproducible results. Statistical experimental designs provide more reliable results and a robust sample processing method. This methodology is increasingly replacing the classical optimization (one factor at a time), which can in some cases lead to erroneous results if there are interactions between the different experimental factors. The experimental design methodology assesses the effects of multilevel factors, together with the interaction between them [15,31]. The aim of this study was to develop and optimize a new and efficient solid-phase extraction method that could be easily adopted for routine monitoring of benzoic and sorbic acids preservatives in juice and soft drink samples. The potential factors affecting the SPE of the analytes were optimized using the experimental design methodology to obtain the best extraction performance and maximum extraction yields. The sorption and desorption steps were evaluated separately and optimized using Box\u2013Behnken designs. A comparison between the C18 sorbent used and the activated carbon and multiwalled carbon nanotube adsorbents, for the extraction of the two acids from drink samples before their simultaneous analysis by liquid chromatography, was investigated. Furthermore, the efficiency of the optimized SPE method for the enrichment of selected preservatives in fruit juice samples and soft drinks was studied."

Specific volumes (factor X1) of the standard solution (40 \u00b5g mL\u22121) were prepared and adjusted to the desired pH (factor X2) and then percolated through the SPE cartridge at a flow rate (factor X3) chosen by the percolation BBD. After passing the acids solution through the column, the recovered solution (reject) was analyzed by HPLC\u2013DAD to determine the amount of acids adsorbed onto silica-based C18. Optimal conditions of this step were then applied when the next elution step was optimized. Indeed, the acids retained on the cartridge were eluted with methanol/acidified water at proportions (factor X1), volumes (factor X2), and flow rate (factor X3) experimentally chosen according to the BBD. The eluted solution (extract) was then analyzed by HPLC\u2013DAD to determine concentrations of the eluted acids. These eluted acids give the extraction yield of the SPE method. Studied responses are the retention yields (Rr) and elution yields (Re) of benzoic and sorbic acids. These yields are calculated as follows:\nRr = Qr Q0 = Q0 \u2212 Qexp Q0 (2)\nRe = Qe Q0\n(3)\nwhere Q0 is the initial concentration of the acid in the percolated solution (40 \u00b5g mL\u22121); Qr is the concentration of the acid retained on the adsorbent during the percolation step; Qexp is the concentration of the acid determined in the recovered solution obtained after the percolation step; and Qe is the concentration of the acid determined in the extract after the elution step.

Each of the three terms can be considered for the second-order fit. The F-value of models of the first-order, two-way interactions, and pure quadratic, indicate that the models were significant at p < 0.05 for the percolation response of both acids. The lack-of-fit values, 3.8 and 6.3 associated with p-values of 0.21 and 0.14, were not significant due to the relative pure error. The results of the present study show that the model is significant with p < 0.05, and by this, the validity of the model is confirmed. Therefore, this model could work for percolation optimization. A summary of significant factors (p < 0.05) and their effect on the response variable are shown in Table 4.

These yields correspond well to the model prediction and are very close to those determined during the SPE method optimization. Therefore, an insignificant effect of the matrix on the efficacy of our extraction method was observed.

Application to Real Samples Robustness is the ability of an analytical method to provide small variations in results when subjected to controlled changes in application conditions (NF V 01\u2014000). To verify the effect of a complex matrix and the robustness of our SPE method, all retained SPE conditions were assessed on real samples (three fruit juices and three soft drinks). Doped (with the two acids at 10 \u00b5g mL\u22121) and nondoped samples undergo the optimized SPE extraction method. The extracts obtained were analyzed by HPLC\u2013DAD.

            "text": "The present optimized SPE method was compared with an SPE method using an abundant and inexpensive adsorbent, oxidized activated carbon (AC), and with an SPE using multiwalled carbon nanotubes, a synthetic and expensive nanomaterial [47,48]. Table 10 shows the average recovery percentages with the relative standard deviations of the three SPE methods tested.\nYields determined with both AC and carbon nanotubes adsorbents are low compared to those determined with silica-based C18. The oxidation of coal generally increases the carboxyl, lactone, phenolic, and carbonyl groups on the surface of this material. Carboxyl groups tend to form water clusters on the micropore openings in the AC surface, thus blocking benzoic and sorbic acids from entering the micropores and hindering the process of adsorption [39]. As for multiwalled carbon nanotubes, their morphology is nanotubular and multiwalled. This morphology is neither homogeneous nor regular, which does not ensure good reproducibility of extraction yields (RSD > 5%)."

            "text": "In the present study, a novel SPE method was developed for the enrichment of benzoic and sorbic acids from food drinks, to be analyzed by liquid chromatography. Therefore, this method could be easily adopted for routine monitoring of BA and SA preservatives in juice and soft drink samples. Compared to the usual method (International Standard ISO 22855-2008) [33], the proposed procedure is simple, fast, clean, and reliable. The extraction and preconcentration of these two acids before analysis increased the sensitivity of the detection method by reducing the matrix effect and concentrating these two acids in the\nFoods 2022, 11, 1257 16 of 18\nfinal extract. On the other hand, the optimization of this SPE method by experimental design methodology (BBD) allowed for obtaining a robust, reliable, reproducible, and precise method with maximum extraction yield. The results showed good extraction yields (higher than 95%) under the following conditions: Conditioning of the C18 column was performed with 10 mL methanol followed by 10 mL of UP water. Then, 1 mL of sample, adjusted to pH 1, was percolated at a flow rate of 4.5 mL min\u22121. Finally, the elution of acids was done with 1 mL of methanol/acidified water (pH = 2.6) (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 4.5 mL min\u22121. Optimal conditions thus determined were successfully applied to commercial fruit juices and soft drinks. A slight matrix effect was observed since the calculated yields were close to those determined during the optimization. The present method was compared with SPE using an oxidized carbon AC and multiwalled carbon nanotubes MWCNT. Silica-based C18 presented better extraction yields. Thus, the proposed new solid-phase extraction method could be used for routine monitoring of preservatives BA and SA in juice and soft drink samples.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.B.K., S.B. and P.M.; methodology, B.B.K., S.K. and S.B.; validation, P.M. and B.B.K.; investigation, B.B.K.; writing original draft preparation, B.B.K. and N.M.; writing review and editing, P.M. and B.B.K.; visualization, R.T., S.K. and S.B.; supervision, B.B.K.
