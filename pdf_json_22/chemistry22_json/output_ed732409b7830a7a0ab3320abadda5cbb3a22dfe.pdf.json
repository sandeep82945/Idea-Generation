            "text": "Plastic debris is the major fraction of solid waste pollution in the marine environment. It is 46 estimated that 75% of all marine litter is plastic (Napper and Thompson, 2020). Among this 47 plastic pollution, approximately 50% of the items are food packaging materials (de Kock et al., 48 2020; Gerigny et al., 2018; OSPAR et al., 2010), of which polypropylene (PP) is one of the 49 most employed resin. Its production accounts for 80-90% of the global plastic demand 50 (PlasticEurope, 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2019), along with expanded polystyrenes (EPS) and 51 polyethylene terephtalate (PET) (I\u00f1iguez et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2011). More than 4000 52 chemicals are known to be in the composition of plastic packaging (Groh et al., 2019), including 53 additives which are intentionally used to improve the properties of the material. A few review 54 papers have highlighted the most common groups of additives in plastics, such as plasticizers, 55 flames retardants, antioxidants and stabilizers (Fred-Ahmadu et al., 2020; Hahladakis et al., 56 2018). Many of the additives (e.g. bisphenols, phthalates, nonylphenols) are known to be 57 hazardous, even at low concentrations, posing a risk for marine organisms (Hahladakis et al., 58 2018; Oehlmann et al., 2009) as a main driver of plastic toxicity (Beiras et al., 2021). The 59 majority of plastic additives are not chemically bound to the plastic polymers and have the 60 potential to leach out from the plastic to the surrounding environment (Andrady, 2011; 61 Koelmans et al., 2014), causing various types of damages to organisms (e.g., embryo 62 development, immobility, physical activity, mortality, endocrine disruption, gene mutation). The 63 ecotoxicity of some plastic leachates has been characterized on diverse aquatic organisms 64 such as copepods, barnacles, oysters, mussels, urchins, lugworms, fish and photosynthetic 65 bacteria (Gardon et al., 2020; Hamlin et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2021; Oliviero et al., 2019; 66 Tallec et al., 2022; Tetu et al., 2019), without, however, identifying the compound(s) 67 responsible for the observed toxicity. Just one single study (Tian et al., 2021) managed this 68 demonstrating the link between the high concentration of a rubber additive subproduct and 69 acute toxicity events in coho salmon. 70\n4\nThe use of petro-based food packaging being controversial, bio-based plastics are more and 71 more promoted as an alternative to conventional plastics, with a production volume which is 72 expected to increase in the future (EuropeanBioplastics, 2021; Geueke et al., 2014). The 73 polylactic acid (PLA) is nowadays the most produced bio-based plastic, especially for food 74 container (FC) products (Ncube et al., 2020). Either way, whether the materials are derived 75 from a natural or petrochemical resource, they are both produced to fulfill the same function 76 and are therefore similarly formulated. There are now some studies that gave first indications 77 of the toxicity of bio-based and biodegradable products and that also demonstrated that bio-78 based materials are not necessarily safer than conventional plastics (Chagas et al., 2021a; 79 Chagas et al., 2021b; de Oliveira et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2021; Lambert and Wagner, 2017; 80 Malafaia et al., 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2020a). 81\nMoreover, concerns have arisen concerning the safety of FCs (Groh and Muncke, 2017) 82 especially in regards to the migration of a wide variety of chemicals for which there is a lack of 83 hazard information (Muncke, 2011). Therefore, it is important to explore the threats of complex 84 and diverse chemical mixtures emitted by plastic products. However, although non-target 85 screening analyses have previously been applied on plastics leachates, most of the chemicals 86 remained unidentified (Muncke, 2011; Zimmermann et al., 2021). As a result, a better and 87 more specified understanding of the composition of plastics is required to relate their chemical 88 content and their toxicity. 89\nThe migration of compounds that are allowed to be included in FCs are only tested in regards 90 to food contact application. However, plastic FCs are widely found in the environment and are 91 therefore present as microplastics (MPs). Hence, it\u2019s important to question the impacts of these 92 particles once in the environment. Thus, this study aims to assess and compare the chemical 93 additive contents and the ecotoxicity of the chemicals leaching from plastic marketed FCs 94 made of PP and PLA. Target chemical analyses were carried out by a stir bar sorptive 95 extraction (SBSE) followed by a thermal desorption gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry 96 in tandem (TD-GC-MS/MS) to characterize chemicals present in the plastics and the ones 97\n5\nreleased in sea water leachates. In addition, we also assessed the leachates ecotoxicity 98 through sensitive short-term bioassays: (i) the base line toxicity with the Microtox\u00ae test on the 99 bioluminescent Aliivibrio fischeri bacteria, chosen as a rapid assay which is reproducible, cost 100 effective and more sensitive than other end points for nonspecific toxicity (Neale et al., 2012), 101 and (ii), two bivalve sensitive endpoints (His et al., 1999), fertilization and embryo-larval 102 developmental success of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. This specie was targeted as a 103 key organism for coastal ecosystems and because of its ecological and economical roles 104 (FAO, 2020). 105\n2. Materials and methods 106\n2.1. Plastic sample selection and production 107\nIn this study, four samples of food packaging items, available on the French market, made of 108 polypropylene (PP) and polylactic acid (PLA) were used. Two items were selected per polymer 109 resin, produced by two different suppliers, tagged A and B. 110\nSmall punches, i.e. cylinders with a diameter of 1 mm, were cut into the food packaging items 111 using biopsy punches from Farla-Medical (Antwerpen, Belgium). Homogeneity of punches was 112 assessed by measuring the thickness and the volume of n=20 punches per polymer type using 113 an Olympus SZX16 stereomicroscope (France) equipped with a UC90 camera and treated 114 using OLYMPYS CellSens Dimension 3.2 software. Data are presented as a mean value \u00b1 115 standard deviation (s.d). 116\n2.2. Extraction of potential additives 117\nTo avoid sample contamination, all glassware was burnt for 6h at 500\u00b0C in a Nabertherm 118 LT40/11/B410 muffle furnace (Lilienthal, Germany) prior to the experiments. Additionally, the 119 preparation of the material\u2019s leachates was conducted under a laminar flow hood. 120\n6\n2.2.1. Extraction of additives from the punch surface (methanol extracts) 121\n200 \u00b1 0.51 mg of plastic punches were weighed for each plastic (n=4). 10 mL of methanol 122 (MeOH) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France) were added to the punches in 123 order to obtain a concentration of 20 mg.mL-1. The mixtures were placed on an orbital shaker 124 at 100 rpm for 24h, in dark conditions at room temperature (20 \u00b0C). A control experiment, i.e. 125 MeOH treatment without any punch was also carried out following the same conditions. At the 126 end of the extractions, the plastics were removed from the MeOH and the extracts were 127 transferred into clean glass bottles and immediately submitted to chemical analysis (part 2.3). 128\n2.2.2. Preparation of leachates in seawater 129\nLeachates were prepared adding 2g of FC punch samples into 1L of filtered natural seawater 130 (FSW) for each product. The FSW used for the leachate preparation was collected in Hardelot 131 (France) autoclaved and filtered on WhatmanTM 0.22 \u03bcm Millipore filters (Maidstone, United 132 Kingdom). Each leachate was placed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm, allowing the plastic 133 pieces to move freely in the water. Leaching was performed for 24h and 5 days in dark 134 conditions at room temperature (20\u00b0C) in order to be in accordance with previous studies 135 mentioning a fast release of organic plastic additives (OPAs) within the first 120h (Gardon et 136 al., 2020; Jang et al., 2021; Paluselli et al., 2019). Nine leaching treatments were prepared: 137 PLA-A (n=2), PLA-B (n=2), PP-A (n=2) and PP-B (n=2) samples at 24h and 5 days, and a 138 control seawater treatment without plastic. At the end of the leaching period, leachates were 139 filtered through WhatmanTM 1.6 \u00b5m GF/A filters (to remove punches), transferred to clean 140 bottles and used as a stock solution for preparation of the six leachates concentrations levels 141 obtained by serial dilutions: 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2000 mg.L-1. The middle range 142 concentration 0,2 and 2 mg.L-1 were chosen to be in similar range as to MPs concentration 143 found in the marine environment, respectively medium and worst case scenario (Paul-Pont et 144 al., 2018). All the leachate solutions were conserved at -20 \u00b0C during one week prior to the 145 chemical characterization and the toxicity assays. For each treatment, 100 mL of the initial 146 leachate (2000 mg.L-1) were sampled for chemical analysis. 147\n7\n2.3. Target chemical analyses 148\nThe OPAs were quantified in the methanolic extracts (cf. 2.2.1) and in the FSW leachates (cf. 149 2.2.2) in duplicates by SBSE-TD-GC-MS/MS following the methodology described by Lacroix 150 et al. (2014). 151\nRegarding the MeOH extracts, 1mL of the samples solutions were transferred to a clean glass 152 bottle and supplemented by 9 mL of MeOH and 100 mL of FSW. For the seawater leachates, 153 an aliquot of 100 mL was transferred to a clean glass bottle and 10 mL of MeOH was added. 154 For both MeOH extract and seawater leachate, the prepared samples were doped with 10 ng 155 of each deuterated standards, i.e. deuterated phthalates, deuterated polybromodiph\u00e9nyl\u00e9ters 156 (PBDEs), deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and deuterated nonylphenol 157 (NPd8). 158\nGerstel Twister, 20 mm x 0.5 mm polydimethylsiloxane stir bar, (M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, 159 Germany) were then placed in each sample on a MIX15 magnetic stirrer (Munich, Germany) 160 and stirred at 700 rpm for 16 h of extraction in the dark at room temperature (20 \u00b0C). At the 161 end of the extraction time, stir-bars were removed from the solutions, rinsed with distilled water, 162 dried over a blot paper, and directly analyzed by TD-GC-MS/MS. 163\nOPAs were analyzed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatography system coupled to an 164 Agilent 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Little Falls, USA). GC-MS/MS device was 165 equipped with a Gerstel thermal desorption unit (TDU) and a MultiPurpose Sampler in order 166 to automatically introduce stir bars into the system. Thermodesorption were carried out at 280 167 \u00b0C for 6 min and samples were then cryofocused at -10 \u00b0C via a Gerstel cooled injection system 168 (CIS). Analytes were injected in splitless mode into an Agilent HP-5MS GC column (Agilent 169 Technologies) (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m) and the CIS was heated to 310 \u00b0C at 12 \u00b0C.s-1. 170 The detailed analytical condition of the GC temperature program and the MS are presented in 171 Table S1. A stir bar conditioning was performed on each bar prior to re-use in order to eliminate 172 any compounds not completely desorbed. 173\n8\nIn total, 57 OPA\u2019s, i.e. 18 plasticizers, 19 flames retardants, 5 antioxidants and 15 stabilizers, 174 were targeted and quantified (Table S2) based on criteria of use, toxicity, concentration in 175 plastics and feasibility of GC-MS analysis. The quantitative analysis of plastic additives was 176 performed by external calibration using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method divided 177 into 4 groups containing a maximum of 20 transitions (Table S3) with two transitions for each 178 compound. Several levels of calibration (i.e. 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 ng.L-1), in duplicate, 179 were prepared. Data analysis was performed using Mass Hunter software from Agilent 180 (10.2.733.8). Analytes were quantified by calculating the target additive/deuterated analyte 181 ratio, and corrected by subtracting the blank (i.e. MeOH or FSW control without FC materials). 182\n2.4. Toxicity assessment on a unicellular organism - Microtox\u00ae assay 183\nThe Microtox\u00ae assay is an acute test measuring the baseline toxicity of a substance based on 184 the decrease or inhibition of the bioluminescence of the bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri (Wadhia and 185 Thompson, 2007). Here, this acute test was performed on each FSW leachate at the highest 186 concentration (i.e. 2000 mg.L-1) and a control treatment (FSW with no addition of plastic), if no 187 effect was observed, the lowest concentrations were not tested. 188\nThe bioluminescence level was measured by Modern Water Ltd Microtox\u00ae FX Analyser (New 189 Castle, DE, USA), following the B-Tox Test procedure of the manufacturer\u2019s manual. Briefly, 190 the lyophilized A.fisheri were rehydrated with 300 \u00b5L of the reconstituted solution (RS), the 191 bacteria and the RS were gently mixed with a micropipette and 100 \u00b5L were immediately 192 transferred into a clean test glass vial. After 15 min of exposure, 900 \u00b5L of working solutions, 193 i.e. either FSW control or leachates, were added into the test vials. Measurements of the 194 luminescence were recorded prior and 15 min after sample addition. The bioluminescence 195 results were automatically compared and corrected with the light output of the control sample, 196 resulting in a relative luminescence inhibition (%). Each assay was performed in triplicate. 197\n9\n2.5. Toxicity assessment on an eukaryote organism - Oysters 198\n2.5.1. Biological material (animal and gamete collection) 199\nMature Pacific oysters were produced as described in Petton et al. (2015) and held in the 200 Ifremer nursery in Bouin (France). In January 2022, a stock of 120 oysters (36 month old, 201 average weight: 47.6 \u00b1 7.2 g) was transferred from the Ifremer nursery to the Ifremer 202 experimental facilities in Argenton (France) at stage 0 (i.e. the undifferentiated stage) and 203 conditioned for 6 weeks with suitable conditions for germ cell maturation. Briefly, oysters were 204 placed in an experimental raceway, using a flow-through system with 20 \u00b5m-filtered running 205 seawater at 18 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b0C and fed with a mixed diet of two microalgae at a daily ration equal to 206 8% dry mass algae/ dry mass oyster. At ripeness (stage 3), oysters were randomly sampled 207 to perform gametes and embryo-larval assays. Oyster sex was determined under an EVOS\u2122 208 XL Core Imaging System microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific Waltham, Massachusetts, 209 USA), \u00d7 10\u201320 magnification, on a 50-\u03bcL subsample from the gonad of each individual. 210 Gametes from 3 males and 3 females were collected by stripping the gonad as described by 211 Steele and Mulcahy (1999). This step was repeated in four replicates, with a total of 12 males 212 and 12 females per condition. Sperm and oocytes solutions were then sieved at 60 \u00b5m in order 213 to eliminate debris. Spermatozoa and oocytes were diluted with respectively 100 mL and 1 L 214 of FSW at 20 \u00b0C, and left for 1 h prior to use to ensure gamete quality, i.e. spermatozoon 215 mobility and round shape of oocytes, which were checked by microscopy (Tallec et al., 2018). 216\n2.5.2. Fertilization success assay 217\nAfter collecting the gametes, their concentrations were assessed by flow cytometry using a 218 EasyCyte Plus cytometer from Guava Merck Millipore (Burlington, Massachusetts, USA). 219 Gametes were placed at the same time in glass vials with a spermatozoa-to-oocyte ratio of 220 100:1 and a final concentration of 1,000 oocytes.mL-1. Vials were filled with the different 221 solutions of leachate to a final volume of 5 mL (4 leachates from FC, 6 concentrations: 0 222 (control FSW), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20 and 200 mg.L-1, and 4 replicates per condition, leading to 96 223\n10\nvials). After 1.5 h of exposition to FC leachates, samples were fixed with a formaldehyde-224 seawater solution (0.1% final) to estimate the fertilization yield under a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 225 microscope with \u00d710-40 magnification. Per vial, 100 oocytes were observed. An oocyte was 226 considered fertilized when polar bodies or cell divisions were observable. The fertilization yield 227 (%) was estimated as: number of fertilized oocytes / total of oocytes \u00d7 100. (Martinez-Gomez 228 et al., 2017). 229\n2.5.3. Embryo-larval assay 230\nThe standardized ISO 17244:2015 assay (ISO, 2015) was used to determine the embryo-231 toxicity of FC leachates. Fertilization was carried out following the procedure described above, 232 in 4 replicates, with gametes collected from 3 males and 3 females per replicates (total: 12 233 males and 12 females) in 2-L glass beakers filled with 1.5 L of FSW. Once fertilization was 234 achieved with high fertilization yields (>90%) and embryos were at the 2-cell stage (verified 235 using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1; \u00d710-40 magnification), embryos were collected and placed in 236 25 mL of the different leachate treatments (control FSW, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2000 mg.L-237 1) to achieve 60 embryos.mL-1. After 48h of exposure in dark conditions, all samples were fixed 238 with a formaldehyde-seawater solution (0.1% final) to estimate the normal D-larval yield. For 239 each vial, 100 larvae were observed using a Zeiss Axiostar Observer Z1 microscope, with \u00d710-240 40 magnification. The normal D-larval yield (%) was defined as: number of normal D-larvae \u00f7 241 (number of normal + abnormal D-larvae) \u00d7 100. Abnormal D-larvae were identified based on 242 morphological malformations (Mottier et al., 2013) such as shell, mantle or hinge 243 malformations, developmental arrest during embryogenesis or evidence of larvae death, e.g. 244 D-stage larvae with an empty shell. 245\n2.6. Statistical analysis 246\nStatistical analyses were performed using R-Studio software (1.4.1106) (R Core Team). 247 Concerning the bioassays, i.e. fertilization success, embryo-larval and Microtox\u00ae assay, all 248 data expressed in percentages were normalized using sin\u22121(\u221a\ud835\udc4b) transformation. Normality 249\n11\nand homoscedasticity were verified before carrying out two-way parametric ANOVA to test the 250 differences in variables between factors, i.e. polymers and leachate concentration. When 251 necessary a Tuckey\u2019s post hoc test was carried out using the car package (3.0-12) (Fox et al., 252 2022) was used to determine the significant differences between each group. Assuming that 253 one of the hypotheses was not verified, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. 254 Kruskal Wallis tests were followed by a Nemeyni\u2019s post hoc test using agricolae (1.3-5) (De 255 Mendiburu, 2021) and PMCMR (4.4) (Pohlert, 2021) packages. Mean differences were 256 considered as significant when p-value < 0.05. Data presented onto the figures are not square 257 root transformed. Target chemical analyses were performed on leachates from all products, 258 statistical significance of differences could not be carried out as only n = 2 leachate solution 259 were analyzed per item. Data were compared based on mix \u2013 max of these n = 2 values. 260\n3. Results 261\n3.1. Characterization of FC punch 262\nThe thickness (\u00b5m) of each sample punches was measured, and the surface areas (mm\u00b2) 263 and masses (\u00b5g) were calculated (Table S4). 264\nThe thickness, surface area and mass for each resin sample were, respectively: 277 \u00b1 10 \u00b5m, 265 2.44 \u00b1 0.01 mm\u00b2 and 272.00 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5g for PLA-A, 353 \u00b1 18 \u00b5m, 2.68 \u00b1 0.06 mm\u00b2 and 346.00 266 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5g for PLA-B, 451 \u00b1 13 \u00b5m, 2.99 \u00b1 0.04 mm\u00b2 and 340.00 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5g for PP-A, and 245 267 \u00b1 15 \u00b5m , 2.34 \u00b1 0.05 mm\u00b2 and 185.00 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5g for PP-B. 268\nSignificant differences in mass were observed between all samples varying from 25 to 46%, 269 except between PLA-B and PP-A (ANOVA followed by Tuckey post Hoc test, p-value < 0.05). 270 Similarly, significant differences were observed in surface area between all samples (ANOVA 271 followed by Tuckey post Hoc test, p-value < 0.05). However, within a polymer the punches 272 metrics were homogeneous (Table S4 and Fig. S1). 273\n12\n3.2. Target OPAs TD-GC-MS/MS analyses into plastic food packaging 274\nmaterials (MeOH extracts) 275\nA total of 21 compounds: 8 plasticizers, 3 phosphorous flame retardants, 5 antioxidants and 5 276 UV-stabilizers were quantified in all MeOH extracts (Fig. 1D). 277\nThe bio-based PLA samples contained the highest number of chemicals: 17 additives were 278 identified in both PLA samples and only 8 to 9 additives were identified in PP samples. PLA 279 and PP samples both contained a majority of plasticizers (respectively 7 compounds out of 17, 280 and 6 compounds out of 8 to 9) and 3 UV-stabilizers. 6 compounds were common to both PP 281 and PLA samples, i.e. plasticizers: Bis-2-Ethylhexyl Adipate (DEHA), Diisoheptyl phthalate 282 (DIHP), Tributyl Acetyl Citrate (ATBC) and Tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHPA), UV 283 stabilizers: UV-328 and UV-327 (Fig. 1A). However PFRs and nonylphenol antioxidants were 284 exclusively identified in PLA extracts and absent from PP extracts. 285\nOverall, the number of OPAs within samples made of the same polymer, A and B, was 286 equivalent: 17 OPAs were identified in both PLA-A and PLA-B, with 16 compounds in common 287 plus one specific for each product (Fig. 1B). Concerning PP samples, 9 and 8 OPAs were 288 detected in PP-A and PP-B respectively, with 8 compounds in common and one specific to 289 PP-A (Fig. 1C). 290\nThe detected OPAs were quantified in the ng.mg-1 range (i.e. between 0.04 to 7.5 ng.mg-1). 291 For the 6 compounds common to both PP and PLA extracts, all the concentrations were higher 292 in PLA extracts in comparison to PP samples (e.g. x5 for UV-328 and ATBC, x9 for UV-327, 293 x2 for TEHPA and x12 for DEHA). The concentrations were considered higher when the factor 294 was > x1.5. 295\nOut of the 16 additives common to all PLA extracts, 7 compounds (Triphenyl Phosphate 296 (TPhP), UV-327, Dicylcohexyl phthalate (DCHP), Nonylphenol Monoethoxylate (NP1OE), 4-297 Tert-Octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-Nonylphenol Monoethoxylate (4-NP1OE) and 4-nonylphenol (4-298 NP)) were measured in higher concentrations (x12 for TPhP and x2 for the other OPAs) in 299\n13\nPLA-A extracts than in extracts from PLA-B, and 4 compounds (UV-326, TEHPA, Tris(1,3-300 Dichloro-2-Propyl)Phosphate (TDCPP) and DEHA) were measured in higher concentrations 301 (x3 for UV-326 and x2 for the other OPAs) in PLA-B extracts compared to PLA-A (Fig. 1D). 302 For OPAs that are common in PP extracts, one compound out of 8 (UV-327) was measured in 303 higher concentrations (x5) in PP-A extracts than in PP-B , and 3 (DEHA, Diisononyl 304 hexahydrophthalate (DINCH) and DIHP) were measured in higher concentrations (all x2) in 305 PP-B extracts compared to PP-A (Fig. 1D). 306\nFigure 1 goes here 307\n3.3. Target OPAs analyses into plastic food packaging leachates 308\n3.3.1. Impacts of the lixiviation duration on OPAs release 309\nOPAs have been detected in all the leachate samples. Overall, the number of additives 310 identified is slightly higher in the 5 days (5d) leachates than in the 24h leachates. A leaching 311 time of 5 days permitted to retrieve the Tricresyl phosphate (TCrP), Nonylphenols (NPs), 312 NP1OE, 4-NP1OE and UV-328. For PLA-A, 10 and 11 compounds were identified in the 24h 313 and 5d leachates respectively, with 10 compounds in common and one specific to the 5d 314 leachates (Fig. 2A and 3A). For PLA-B, 8 and 9 compounds were identified in the 24h and 5d 315 leachates respectively, with 8 compounds in common and one specific to the 5d leachates 316 (Fig. 2B and 3B). Concerning PP leachates, 9 and 12 compounds were identified in the 24h 317 and 5d PP-A leachates respectively, with 8 compounds in common, one in the 24h leachates 318 only, and 4 specific to the 5d leachates (Fig. 2C and 3C). Finally, 10 and 12 compounds were 319 identified in the 24h and 5d PP-B leachates respectively, with 9 compounds in common, one 320 in the 24h leachates exclusively, and 3 specific to the 5d leachates (Fig. 2D and 3D). 321\nThe quantitative results do not show any clear pattern in 24h vs. 5d leachates. Concerning 322 PLA-A leachates, 2 compounds (ATBC and NPs) were present in higher concentration in the 323 24h leachates, as well as two compounds (TDCPP and TCrP) that showed higher 324 concentrations in the 5d leachates (Fig. 2E.1.). Similarly, the analysis of PLA-B leachates 325\n14\nshowed higher concentration for 3 compounds (ATBC, NPs and NP1OE) in 24h leachates, as 326 well as 3 compounds (Dimethyl phthalate (DMP), Tripropyl phosphate (TPP) and TDCPP) in 327 5d leachates (Fig. 2E.2.). 328\nThe PP-A 5d leachates presented higher concentrations for 5 compounds out of 13 (DMP, 329 TCrP, NPs, 4-NP and NP1OE), when the PP-A 24h leachate had higher concentrations for 330 only 2 OPAs (ATBC and TPP) (Fig. 2E.3.). The PP-B leachate showed 4 compounds out of 13 331 with a higher concentration in the 24h leachates (DMP, DINCH, TPP and TDCPP). In contrast, 332 the 5d leachate had higher concentrations for 3 compounds (ATBC, 4-NP1OE and UV-327) 333 (Fig. 2E.4.). 334\nConsidering the results presented above, the 5 days leaching time was chosen for the further 335 chemical and ecotoxicological experiments. 336\nFigure 2 goes here 337\n3.3.2. OPAs in food packaging\u2019s 5 days leachates 338\nIn 5d leachates from PP and PLA samples, a total 16 OPAs were detected. PLA leachate 339 samples contained plasticizers (3 compounds out of 9 and 12 for A and B suppliers 340 respectively), phosphorous flames retardants (3 and 2 compounds), antioxidants (3 341 compounds each) and UV-stabilizers (2 and 1 compounds). PP leachates samples contained 342 a majority of plasticizers (4 and 5 compounds out of 12, for A and B suppliers respectively), 343 followed by phosphorous flames retardants and antioxidants (3 and 2 compounds each), and 344 UV-stabilizers (2 to 3 compounds). (Fig. 3C). 345\nBeyond that, the number of OPAs between the PP and the PLA leachates was equivalent, with 346 11 and 9 OPAs identified in PLA-A and PLA-B respectively (8 common compounds, 3 347 compounds specific to the supplier A and one specific to the supplier B) (Fig. 3A), and 12 348 OPAs identified in both PP-A and PP-B leachates (9 common OPAs and 3 specific to each 349 suppliers) (Fig. 3B). 350\n15\nOPA concentrations in 5d FC leachates ranged between 0.02 and 135.82 ng.L-1. The 351 quantitative results of OPAs do not show any clear patterns between the different leachate 352 samples. Detailed results are presented in Figure 4C, and some tendencies, that illustrate 353 differences between polymer leachates or suppliers, are given below: 2 plasticizers (DEHA 354 and DIHP) were quantified exclusively in PP leachates (at concentrations ranging from 1.55 to 355 52.28 ng.L-1). DINCH was only found in PLA-A at a concentration of 16.66 ng.L-1. ATBC was 356 quantified in PP leachates from the supplier B only (135.8 ng.L-1) at a concentration higher (x3) 357 than in PLA-A and B leachates (46.9 \u00b1 1.42). TCrP was only present in PP-A and PLA-A, both 358 at a concentration of 2.22 ng.L-1. All the leachates contained UV-327 at similar concentrations 359 (0.29 ng.L-1) except in PP-B where this additive was measured at higher (x21) concentration 360 (6.12 ng.L-1) (Fig. 3C). 361\nFigure 3 goes here 362\n3.3.3. Comparison of the additive contents between raw materials and 363\nseawater leachates 364\nSome additives were only detected in PLA and PP MeOH extracts (Fig. 1D) but not in their 365 respective leachates (Fig. 3C) (i.e. UV-328, UV-326, TPhP and DEHA for PLA and DINCH and 366 ATBC for PP-A only; Fig S2). Conversely, some additives detected in leachates were absent 367 from MeOH extract (i.e. TDCPP and 4-NP in PP samples, TPP in PP samples and PLA-B, 368 DMP in PLA-B, NPs and NP1OE in PP-A sample) (Fig. S2). 369\n3.4. Evaluation of the ecotoxicity of plastic food packaging leachates 370\n3.4.1. Baseline toxicity using Microtox\u00ae assay 371\nNo significant effect of leachate exposure was observed on the bioluminescence of the bacteria 372 Aliivibrio fischeri (Fig. S3). The results showed less than 10% of bioluminescence inhibition 373 regardless of the material and concentration used. 374\n16\n3.4.2. Early life stages of Pacific oyster 375\n3.4.2.1. Effects of FC leachates on fertilization 376\nNo significant differences (ANOVA, p-values > 0.05) were observed on the fertilization yield 377 following the exposure of the oyster gametes to the different concentrations of plastic 378 packaging leachates compared to the control treatment (i.e. FSW) (86.5 \u00b1 6.5%). Only the 379 highest concentration (Ii.e.200 mg.L-1) of PLA-B significantly reduced the fertilization yield in 380 comparison to the FSW control treatment (-12%; ANOVA followed by Tuckey post Hoc test, p-381 value < 0.05) (Fig. 4). Overall, the fecundation rate remained high (>70%) regardless of the 382 treatment (except for PLA-B at 200mg.L-1). 383\nFigure 4 goes here 384\n3.4.2.2. Effects of FC leachates on oyster embryo-larval 385\ndevelopment 386\nThe percentage of normal D shaped larvae in controls was >80% (Fig. 5). None of the leachate 387 concentrations induced embryo-toxicity (ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, p-values > 0.05) compared 388 to the control treatment (mean D-larvae yield = 86 \u00b1 9.2%) (Fig. 5). 389\nFigure 5 goes here 390\n4. Discussion 391\n4.1. Characterization of OPAs and their release from FCs 392\nMaterial MeOH extracts and leachate analyses provided information on the chemicals 393 associated with plastic packaging and those able to desorb into seawater. Despite some 394 additives that were identified below the detection limit, 22 additives (i.e. phthalates, PFRs, 395 antioxidants and UV-stabilizers) were successfully identified and quantified among the 396 selected compounds. Only 7 of the identified chemicals are included in the permitted starting 397 material of EU No 10/2011 (EuropeanCommission, 2011) (i.e. Uvinul 3008; UV 327; UV 326; 398 DEHA; DINCH; Di-allyl phthalate (DAlP); ATBC), and 9 are included in the list established by 399\n17\nOltmanns et al. (2020) compiling 2336 potential emerging toxic chemicals used in FCs, based 400 on a previous EFSA study compiling substances registered under the REACH Regulation (i.e. 401 Uvinul 3008, UV 328,UV 327, TPP, TDCPP, DEHA, DINCH, ATBC and 4-NP) (Fig. 1 and 3). 402 It means that for some of the additives not included in those regulatory lists, the sanitary risks 403 remain unknown since no toxicological or migratory test has been performed. 404\nIt is noteworthy that in this study, the number of detected phthalates are underestimated since 405 some phthalate compounds such as DEHP, DEP, DBP and DIDP could not be properly 406 characterized because they were ubiquitous contaminants in the laboratory and instruments. 407 Additionally, quantities of some additives, e.g. DMP and ATBC, recorded in the controls (MeOH 408 and seawater without plastic) indicated presence of these compounds in the reagents 409 employed in this experiment or contamination during sample preparation. Such results 410 underline the difficulties and the challenge of studying additive composition of plastic in the 411 laboratory (Zimmermann et al., 2019). Indeed, they are omnipresent (e.g. found in indoor air, 412 solvents, water, experimental apparatus, protection equipment, glassware) and may prevent 413 their studies (Hermabessiere et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2013). 414\nThe higher additive occurrence and concentration (e.g. TDCPP in PLA-A, DMP in PP-A) 415 observed in 5d leachates in comparison to 24h leachates was the basis for choosing a 5 days 416 leaching time for further experiments. This was in agreement with other studies that used a 417 leaching time of 5 days (CEN, 2002; Tetu et al., 2019), and studies that also demonstrated 418 higher additive concentrations in 5d leachates than in 24h leachates (Gardon et al., 2020). It 419 also permitted a great chemical desorption while avoiding the readsorption of the leached 420 chemicals onto the surface of the plastic particle as noticed by Romera-Castillo et al. (2018). 421 However, it is a complicated task to choose an appropriate leaching duration. Indeed, results 422 published in the literature highlight the dependence of additives\u2019 desorption processes on 423 many parameters including the polymer type and the additive. For instance, Le\u00f3n et al. (2019) 424 mentioned higher additive desorption rates for PP in comparison to PE. Additionally, the 425 leaching dynamics differ according to the nature of additives. For example, the time needed to 426\n18\nreach the desorption equilibrium concentration was estimated to be 3 days for BPA, while it 427 was 80 days for phthalates compounds (Suhrhoff and Scholz-B\u00f6ttcher, 2016). 428\nOur results showed the presence of OPAs such as phosphorous flame retardants (PFRs), 429 antioxidants and UV-stabilizers and with a dominance of plasticizer compounds (Fig. 1 and 3) 430 both in MeOH extracts and leachates. Similar compounds have already been identified and 431 quantified in diverse polymer FC items in the literature. For instance, ATBC and Uvinul 3008 432 (i.e. Octabenzone) were identified in PP samples (Lahimer et al., 2017; Zimmermann et al., 433 2019) and in plastic-based candy wrappers (Galm\u00e1n Gra\u00ed\u00f1o et al., 2018). Several PAEs, 434 ATBC and DINCH were detected in PVC FC (Carlos et al., 2018), and, Lahimer et al. (2017) 435 identified UV 326 (i.e. Bumetrizole) in PLA samples. 436\nDiscrepancies in the chemical signature of MeOH extracts and leachates suggest that not all 437 OPAs are leaching or that the concentration of the leachable additives was below the detection 438 limit (Zimmermann et al., 2021). The presence of additives in leachates that were not detected 439 in the MeOH extract (e.g. UV 326, TPhP, Di-n-hexyl phthalate (DHP), DCHP, DAlP and 4-OP) 440 suggests a preferential migration or dissolution into water over methanol (Zimmermann et al., 441 2019; 2021) . 442\nOn the one hand, differences in chemical composition and concentration of MeOH extracts 443 between the two types of polymers selected were observed. A greater number of additives and 444 higher concentrations were measured in bio-based PLA MeOH extracts in comparison to PP 445 MeOH extracts, which was also observed in the study of Zimmermann et al. (2019) study. 446 Moreover, the presence of PFRs and nonylphenols antioxidants, exclusively identified in PLA 447 extracts and absent from PP extracts, suggest that the bio-based PLA material contains more 448 hazardous additives than the PP material. On the other hand, the number of additives between 449 PLA and PP leachates was more or less equivalent and were only differentiated by the 450 signatures and concentrations of additives which was not in accordance with other studies. For 451 instance, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to HR-MS, Klein et 452 al. (2021) detected the highest number of chemicals and intensities in bio-based plastic 453\n19\nleachates (PBAT + PLA) in comparison to other polymers including PP. The amount of 454 additives in bio-based samples was even comparable to PVC, known to be a polymer 455 containing larger amounts of plasticizers and stabilizers (Groh et al., 2019; Hahladakis et al., 456 2018). Gewert et al. (2018) also detected similarly low amounts of OPAs in PP using LC-457 HRMS, while Bradley and Coulier (2007) identified more chemicals but using a wide variety of 458 analytical techniques. Additionally, Zimmermann et al. (2021) showed that products made of 459 PLA leached relatively few products compared to PP. Evidentially, it is complex to draw 460 conclusions about each type of plastic material, as their recipes and individual properties can 461 be major factors in desorption. 462\nResults also pointed out leaching differences between polymers. For instance, DEHA 463 plasticizer, which is present in all the materials\u2019 MeOH extract samples (Fig 1D), leached in 464 the SW only for PP samples. This may highlight a difference in leaching properties of additives 465 between the two polymers used in this study, which could be explained by the nature of the 466 polymer (Li et al., 2016) and notably their differences in physicochemical properties (i.e. 467 surface and porosity) (Barrick et al., 2021). 468\nThe surface, known to significantly affect desorption (Sun et al., 2021; Van de Ven, 1994) , 469 also differs between the sample resin and between the suppliers, but was considered 470 homogeneous within each replicate of the same FC. However, despite the surfaces\u2019 disparities 471 no relationship could be established with among leaching concentrations. As an example, the 472 lower surface area of PP-B (2.34 \u00b1 0.05 mm\u00b2), compared to the other PP and PLA samples, is 473 not related to lower quantities of additives. 474\n4.2. Complexity of plastic products\u2019 chemical composition 475\nThis study highlighted differences in the chemical composition and concentration between 476 manufacturers. Diversity in chemical signatures and high variability of OPAs migration between 477 polymers and suppliers have also been observed in a few studies (Hamlin et al., 2015; 478 Zimmermann et al., 2019 and 2021). Beyond differences in the formulation of each plastic 479 product (Groh et al. 2019), highlighted by different chemical signatures in the MeOH extracts 480\n20\nwithin a polymer type, the release of additives from plastic materials in leachates is also 481 modulated by the permeability of the polymeric matrix, gaps between polymer molecules, 482 physicochemical properties of the additives and properties of the surrounding medium (e.g. 483 salinity, temperature, pH) and time (Kwan and Takada, 2016). It reinforces the challenge to 484 assess the exhaustive chemical composition of plastic materials and leachates by current 485 analytical methodologies (Bolgar et al., 2007; Muncke et al., 2020). 486\nGiven the diversity of plastic associated chemicals (Groh et al., 2019) the target analysis based 487 on 57 targeted additives (Table S1) is certainly not representative. Several studies have lead 488 a non-target screening of compounds in plastic food packaging, revealing more than 1000 489 chemical features in petro- and bio-based FC materials, including PP and PLA (Zimmermann 490 et al., 2020a; Zimmermann et al., 2020b). Nonetheless, compounds identification with non-491 target screening approaches are approximate and care should be taken when interpreting the 492 results. Zimmerman et al., (2020b; 2021) and von Eyken et al. (2020) demonstrates that most 493 plastic chemicals remain unknown due to incorrect identification by databases. But this 494 approach can however help to highlight patterns and emerging compounds. Additionally, 495 targeting molecules of interest may help to show the presence of potentially toxic compounds, 496 which will, in combination with ecotoxicological studies, be complementary to gain a global 497 insight of the material risk. 498\nOverall, this work provides information on the chemical composition of FC samples made out 499 of PP and PLA, along with the identification of 21 additives in these materials and 16 that 500 leached into SW, in particular phthalates, followed by flame retardants, antioxidants and UV 501 stabilizers. Once released from the polymer matrix into the environment, those molecules can 502 become available for organisms and could cause diverse effects such as endocrine disruption, 503 reproductive, development, mutagenic or behavioral effects (Gunaalan et al., 2020; Muncke, 504 2011). 505\n21\n4.3. Bioassays 506\nThe previous chemical analysis showed the leaching of some additive compounds known to 507 be toxic to marine organisms (e.g. NPs and phthalates) (Hamlin et al., 2015; Hermabessiere 508 et al., 2017; Schrank et al., 2019). However, no effects were observed in the study for any of 509 the carried out bioassay, i.e. Microtox\u00ae base line toxicity test, fertilization and embryo-larval 510 development of C.gigas for short leachate exposure times (a few minutes in Microtox\u00ae to 1.5 h 511 for the oyster embryo-larval test). 512\nPrevious in vitro experiments conducted on plastic FC leachates (including PP and PLA) 513 reported baseline toxicity migrating from the products (Szczepannska et al., 2018; 514 Zimmermann et al. 2019; 2020b). Nonetheless, Zimmermann et al. (2020b) pointed out that 515 toxicity was less prevalent in FCs than in plastic not intended to be in contact with food. 516 Disparities of additive numbers and concentrations between manufacturers, as well as 517 variation in base line toxicity depending on the products have also been reported (Klein et al., 518 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2019). However, the leached additives that were toxic in vitro 519 remained mostly unidentified (Zimmermann et al., 2019). 520\nAdditionally, previous studies have demonstrated toxic impacts of various plastic leachates 521 (not labelled FC) on fertilization or embryo development of diverse aquatic species such as 522 oysters (Gardon et al., 2020; Tallec et al., 2022), mussels (Capolupo et al., 2020; Gandara et 523 al., 2016) and urchins (Oliviero et al., 2019). However, it is important to highlight that most 524 studies conducted their experiments with a worst-case scenario approach, i.e. with high 525 concentrations of plastics (5 to 50 times higher than ours). In addition, some studies enhance 526 migration with a polar solvent (dimethyl sulfoxyde, dichloromethane, MeOH (Capolupo et al., 527 2020; Pannetier et al., 2019)), instead of testing migration using more realistic and softer 528 solvents (e.g. seawater). Although the latter example aims to mimic the desorption of polar 529 organic contaminants, it do not represent the conditions occurring in digestive guts of animals 530 which are characterized by specific pH, digestive enzyme contents, and organic matter 531 (Hermabessiere et al., 2020). Besides, in the case of FC studies, the leaching tests of additives 532\n22\nare often perform according to the protocol set by the EU regulation for plastic FCs (i.e. during 533 10 days at 40 \u00b0C in the dark) (EuropeanCommission, 2011; Zimmermann et al., 2021) which 534 was not selected in this case as this work aimed at studying the impact of chemical release in 535 the marine environment. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no study conducted analyses 536 of plastic FC leachate in regards to their effects on fertilization and embryo toxicity.. Thus, this 537 present study could be a first attempt to evaluate the effects of plastic FC leached chemicals 538 on the gamete fertilization and embryo-larval development of an aquatic species. 539\nAs no toxic effects were observed, the estimation of the half maximal effective concentration 540 (EC50) (i.e. indicating the concentration of a compound when 50% of its maximal effect is 541 observe, that require a wider range of tested concentrations, , was not possible, or, was higher 542 than 2000 mg/L for all the polymer leachates and for all bioassays performed (i.e. embryo 543 toxicity and Microtox\u00ae). Furthermore, the absence of toxicity can also be explained by an 544 incomplete lixiviation of additives from the materials due to the low diffusivities of certain 545 additives, like NPs, from certain rigid plastics (Berens, 1997; Koelmans et al., 2014), resulting 546 in a low exposure of the test organisms to OPAs. In addition, in this study, leachates were 547 produced in seawater in the dark. However, different environmental conditions such as water 548 movement, salinity, UV irradiance, and environmental degradation processes, influence the 549 leaching behavior of additives from plastic items. These environmental conditions can also 550 facilitate the release of plastic chemicals and/or generate active compounds and, thus, can 551 affect their toxicity to organisms (Huang et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2021). Likewise, in a human 552 health sanitary safety approach, or in the case of OPAs release in the digestive tract after 553 ingestion of micro particles, different and enhanced mechanisms of lixiviation may occur. For 554 instance, NPs being lipophilic could be expected to more readily migrate into fatty foods over 555 food with lower lipid content or seawater (Hamlin et al., 2015). 556\nIn any case, it should be kept in mind that \u201cthe absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\u201d 557 (Leslie and Depledge, 2020). Even if short-term acute bioassays are useful tools, they neither 558 allow the observation of long term and transgenerational effects, nor the assessment of 559\n23\nreproductive disruption effects, that are both widely suspected consequences of plastic 560 additives. 561\n5. Conclusion 562\nThe results demonstrate that all the tested products (PP and PLA polymers) contained and 563 released OPAs into seawater under the tested conditions. The chemical content and the 564 leachate composition differed from one polymer to another and, most importantly, variations 565 were found among the same polymer type from one supplier to another. As a result, it was not 566 possible to generalize and attribute a chemical pattern to a specific polymer type since 567 variations were recorded at product level. Evidently, this part highlights the importance of the 568 characterization of the \u201cadditivome\u201d, i.e the additive\u2019s content, of the microplastics used for 569 toxicological tests. 570\nEven if the results demonstrate that the tested petro- and biobased samples both leached 571 additives compounds, none of the in vitro bioassay showed any acute toxicity of the leachates 572 at relevant or high environmental concentrations, with the selected experimental conditions. 573 However, although three different bioassays were tested, it is only possible to draw a 574 conclusion for the perimeter of the conditions tested. As a result, beyond the standard tests 575 applied for food contact packaging which imply that these materials do not transfer compounds 576 to food, results showed that once in the environment the tested FC might not induce acute 577 toxic effects. In future work, modifications of environmental parameters (e.g. temperature, 578 microbial activity, UVs, weathering), organisms tested, and duration of exposure, may provide 579 additional understanding of the toxicology associated with the leachates of these FCs. 580\n6.
