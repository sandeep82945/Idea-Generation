    "abstractText": "The vast majority of excitatory synapses are formed on small dendritic protrusions termed dendritic spines. Dendritic spines vary in size and density that are crucial determinants of excitatory synaptic transmission. Aberrations in spine morphogenesis can compromise brain function and have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Actin filaments (F-actin) are the major structural component of dendritic spines, and therefore, actin-binding proteins (ABP) that control F-actin dis-/ assembly moved into the focus as critical regulators of brain function. Studies of the past decade identified the ABP cofilin1 as a key regulator of spine morphology, synaptic transmission, and behavior, and they emphasized the necessity for a tight control of cofilin1 to ensure proper brain function. Here, we report spine enrichment of cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), a conserved multidomain protein with largely unknown physiological functions. Super-resolution microscopy and live cell imaging of CAP1-deficient hippocampal neurons revealed impaired synaptic F-actin organization and dynamics associated with alterations in spine morphology. Mechanistically, we found that CAP1 cooperates with cofilin1 in spines and that its helical folded domain is relevant for this interaction. Moreover, our data proved functional interdependence of CAP1 and cofilin1 in control of spine morphology. In summary, we identified CAP1 as a novel regulator of the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton that is essential for synaptic cofilin1 activity.",

            "text": "Most excitatory synapses in the vertebrate brain are formed on small dendritic protrusions termed dendritic spines [7]. Dendritic spines contain a postsynaptic density (PSD), which opposes the presynaptic active zone and consists of scaffolding proteins anchoring neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, adhesion, and signaling molecules that collectively mediate postsynaptic responses to neurotransmitter release [66]. The PSD scaffold is directly linked to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. Actin filaments (F-actin) are the major cytoskeletal component in spines, and actinbinding proteins (ABP) that regulate assembly or disassembly of F-actin control spine morphology and density [7]. Consequently, dysfunction of ABPs affects synaptic transmission and has been associated with mental retardation or neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or schizophrenia [8, 21, 68]. Hence, deciphering postsynaptic actin regulatory mechanisms is mandatory to understand the\n* Marco B.

Specifically, these studies identified cofilin1 as a key regulator of postsynaptic F-actin dynamics. Further, they implicated cofilin1 in the pathology of neuropsychiatric diseases and proved modulation of cofilin1 activity as a promising therapeutic avenue. Together, these studies highlighted the necessity for a tight regulation of synaptic cofilin1 activity to ensure brain function [3, 55, 56]. De-/phosphorylation of a conserved serine residue at position 3 (Ser3) is as an important mechanism to control cofilin1 activity, and several pathways that impinge on either LIM kinases or slingshot, which phosphorylate or dephosphorylate Ser3, respectively, have been identified to date [55]. However, apart from these pathways, only very little is known about synaptic cofilin1 regulation.\nBy using recombinant proteins, recent in\u00a0vitro work established the multidomain protein cyclase-associated protein1 (CAP1) as a regulator of F-actin dynamics [25, 29, 30, 65]. These studies implicated the conserved helical folded domain (HFD) in actin dissociation from F-actin\nand \u03b2-sheets within the CAP and RP2 (CARP) domain in nucleotide exchange on globular actin monomers (G-actin). However, the physiological functions of CAP1 remained largely unknown [58, 59]. Here, we report enrichment of CAP1 in the head of dendritic spines. Depletion of CAP1 in primary hippocampal neurons from gene-targeted mice revealed a role for CAP1 in regulating the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton as well as spine morphology and density. We show that this depended on its helical folded domain (HFD), which is relevant for the interaction with cofilin1. Rescue experiments in double knockout neurons lacking CAP1 and cofilin1 revealed their cooperation in the regulation of spine shape and they proved functional interdependence of both ABP in the postsynaptic compartment. Together, we found CAP1 to be important for cofilin1 function in spines, and we thereby report a novel mechanism that controls synaptic cofilin1 activity."

            "text": "While previous studies reported the presence of CAP1 during embryonic brain development [4, 61], its expression in the postnatal brain and its subcellular localization in differentiated neurons are unknown. Immunoblots revealed the presence of CAP1 throughout postnatal development in mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig.\u00a01A). Similarly, CAP1 was expressed in mouse primary neurons kept in culture for 2\u201316\u00a0days (Fig.\u00a01B). Further, we found CAP1 present in the soluble, but not in the insoluble, fraction of synapse-enriched lysates termed synaptosomes (Fig.\u00a01C). Together, CAP1 is expressed throughout postnatal brain development, and our data suggest synaptic localization.\nTo further study the subcellular localization of CAP1, we exploited mouse hippocampal neurons isolated at embryonic day (E) 18.5. We transfected neurons after 6\u00a0days in\u00a0vitro (DIV) with constructs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged CAP1 (CAP1-GFP) and the volume marker Discosoma red fluorescent protein (dsRed), and we determined CAP1-GFP localization at DIV16 (Fig.\u00a01D). In control neurons, we expressed GFP that showed the expected equal distribution within the dendritic compartment, similar to the volume marker dsRed (Fig.\u00a01D, E). CAP1-GFP was present in virtually all dendritic spines, independent of their size or morphology. Compared to GFP-expressing neurons, GFP intensity was increased in spines of neurons expressing CAP1-GFP (Fig.\u00a01D). This was also evident from the higher GFP intensity in spines when compared to dsRed (GFP/dsRed ratio) for both mushroom-like and thin spines (Figs.\u00a01F, S1A). These data suggested enrichment of\nFig. 1 HYPERLINK \"sps:id::fig1||locator::gr1||MediaObject::0\" Enrichment of CAP1 in spine heads.

Supportively, GFP intensity profile in CAP1GFP-expressing neurons overlapped with that of the F-actin marker mCherry-LifeAct, which as expected was enriched in dendritic spines (Fig. S1B, C). Antibody staining confirmed CAP1 presence in dendritic spines and proved that CAP1-GFP faithfully reflects localization of endogenous protein (Fig. S1D). Hippocampal neurons from brain-specific CAP1-KO mice were exploited for control experiments [61], which proved specificity of the antibody (Fig. S1E).\nTo determine the sub-synaptic localization of endogenous CAP1, we performed stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy, which confirmed CAP1 localization in spines and unveiled partial colocalization with the PSD marker Shank3 (Figs. 1H, I; S2). Additionally, it revealed CAP1 localization in presynaptic boutons identified by Bassoon immunoreactivity. To better characterize CAP1 distribution in spines, we performed STED nanoscopy on neurons stained with Shank3 and the F-actin marker phalloidin (Figs.\u00a01J, S3), which were used to outline the PSD and spines, respectively. We quantified relative fluorescence of CAP1, Shank3 and phalloidin by using a mask that subdivides spine heads into quadrants (Q), each of which were composed of three equally sized segments (Fig.\u00a01K), similar to a previous study [41]. As expected, Shank3 was enriched in QIV, opposite to the spine neck, and phalloidin intensity was equally high in QI-III, but low in QIV. While CAP1 was present in all four quadrants, it was rather weak in the region close to the spine neck (QI) and showed highest intensity in QII and III. These data were in line with partial colocalization of CAP1 and Shank3, but suggested higher CAP1 abundance in spine head regions outside the PSD. We also determined the centers of mass within spines for all three fluorescent signals. As shown in the scheme (Fig.\u00a01K), the coordinate system\u2019s origin represents the center of the circular region of interest. As expected, this analysis revealed no differences between Shank3, phalloidin and CAP1 along the y-axis (Fig.\u00a01L; Shank3: \u22121.86 \u00b1 2.41, phalloidin: \u22120.74 \u00b1 1.29, CAP1: \u22121.05 \u00b1 1.50, n = 20/3; Shank3 vs CAP1: P = 0.812, phalloidin vs CAP1: P = 0.893, Shank3 vs phalloidin: P = 0.730). CAP1\u2019s center of mass along the x-axis, which approximately reflected the PSD-spine neck axis, laid between Shank3 and phalloidin and differed from both (CAP1: \u22127.93 \u00b1 0.93; phalloidin: 0.11 \u00b1 1.44, P < 0.001; Shank3: \u221214.88 \u00b1 2.15, P < 0.05), thereby supporting our assumption that CAP1 is enriched in spine head regions beneath the PSD. Together, our data revealed localization of endogenous CAP1 in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments of hippocampal excitatory synapses. In the\npostsynaptic compartment, CAP1 was enriched in spine head regions underneath the PSD.\nCAP1 is\u00a0relevant for\u00a0dendritic spine density and\u00a0morphology\nTo investigate the neuronal function of CAP1, we genetically removed CAP1 from hippocampal neurons isolated from conditional CAP1 (CAP1flx/flx) mice [61]. We therefore transfected CAP1flx/flx neurons at DIV6 with either catalytically active mCherry-Cre (Cre) or a catalytically inactive mutant Cre variant (Cre-mut). Immunocytochemistry proved absence of CAP1 from Cre-transfected CAP1flx/flx neurons (Fig. S4), which we refer to as CAP1-KO neurons throughout the manuscript. Instead, CAP1 was present upon Cremut transfection, and these neurons served as control (CTR). First, we performed a thorough morphometric analysis of GFP-transfected neurons at DIV16 (Fig. S5A). In CAP1KO neurons, the number of primary neurites, the number of branching points or the branching point number normalized to dendritic length was unchanged (Fig. S5B-D, Tab. S1), suggesting overall preserved morphology. To better judge dendritic tree complexity, we performed Sholl analysis, which revealed a slightly lower number of intersections between concentric circles and dendrites at intermediate distances from soma in CAP1-KO neurons (Fig. S5E, F). While the radius with highest count of intersections was closer to the soma in CAP1-KO neurons, the maximal number of intersections and the ramification index (maximal intersections/primary dendrites) was not different between CTR and CAP1-KO neurons (Fig. S5G\u2013I, Tab. S1). Together, morphology was largely preserved in CAP1-KO neurons, and they displayed only slight changes in dendritic tree complexity.\nCAP1 enrichment in dendritic spines motivated us to next determine spine number and morphology. Compared to CTR, spine density was reduced by 17%, while spine volume was increased by 27% (Fig.\u00a02A\u2013C, Tab. S2). Consistent with enlarged spine volume, spine head width was increased by 31%, while total spine length or spine head length were unchanged (Fig.\u00a02D\u2013F, Tab. S3). Further, we determined the fractions of spine types in CAP1-KO neurons (Fig. S6A), similar to previous studies [20]. In CAP1-KO neurons, the fractions of filopodia-like and thin spines were reduced, while the fractions of stubby and mushroom-like spines were increased (Fig.\u00a02G; Tab. S4). Hence, the spine type distribution was shifted towards larger spines (stubby, mushroom-like) in CAP1-KO neurons. Together, CAP1 inactivation increased spine size and reduced spine density. Since F-actin constitutes the major structural component in spines and determines their morphology, we hypothesize a role for CAP1 in regulating the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton.\nFunctional interdependence of\u00a0the\u00a0actin regulators CAP1 and\u00a0cofilin1 in\u00a0control of\u00a0dendritic\u2026\n1 3\nPage 5 of 21 558\nCAP1 controls the\u00a0postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton\nTo test this hypothesis, we investigated both postsynaptic actin turnover and F-actin organization in CAP1-KO neurons. For better comparability, we restricted our analysis to mushroom-like spines, which displayed a 22% increase in head width in CAP1-KO neurons (Fig.\u00a03A, Tab. S3), while\nthe morphologies of filopodia-like, thin, or stubby spines were unchanged (Fig. S6B\u2013D, Tab. S3). To study whether CAP1 was relevant for actin turnover, we expressed GFPactin in neurons and performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in individual spines (Fig.\u00a03B, Movies S1-2). During 300\u00a0s of recording, GFPactin levels in CTR spines reached a plateau at roughly 0.8\nCTR CAP1-KO\nH ea\nd le\nng th\n(\u00b5 m\n)\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75 ns\nE GF\nA G FP OK-1PACRTC\nCTR\nFr ac\ntio n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nCAP1-KO\n***\nDCB\nCTR CAP1-KO\nH ea\nd w\nid th\n(\u00b5 m\n)\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00 ***\nCTR CAP1-KO Sp\nin e\nle ng\nth (\u00b5\nm )\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5 ns\nSp in\ne vo\nlu m\ne (a\n.u .)\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nCTR\n***\nCAP1-KO\nSp in\ne de\nns ity\n(\u00b5 m\n-1 )\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nCTR\n**\nCAP1-KO\nFilopodia Thin\nOthers\nBranched\nStubby Mushroom\nFig. 2 Reduced spine density and increased spine size in CAP1-KO neurons.

While this fraction was 54% higher in CAP1KO spines (0.34 \u00b1 0.06, n = 33/9/3), this increase did not reach statistical significance. However, compared to CTR, fluorescence recovery was slower in CAP1-KO spines, as\nevident from a 51% increase in half-recovery time of the dynamic actin fraction (Fig.\u00a03E; (s) CTR: 31.60 \u00b1 5.76, CAP1-KO: 47.75 \u00b1 4.83, P < 0.05).

We therefore performed STED nanoscopy on fixed GFP-expressing neurons stained with phalloidin (Figs.\u00a03F, S7). GFP was used to outline spines and, thus, to determine relative distribution of fluorescence intensities of phalloidin as shown in the scheme in Fig.\u00a01K. In CTR spines, we found the expected homogeneous distribution of phalloidin in QI-III and lower levels in QIV (Fig.\u00a03G). Compared to CTR, phalloidin distribution was changed in CAP1-KO spines, in which it was enriched in QI, at the spine head base. Hence, relative F-actin distribution was altered in CAP1-KO spines. Because F-actin in spines is relevant for anchoring scaffolding proteins of the PSD, we next determined whether altered F-actin distribution in CAP1-KO spines was associated with an altered distribution of the key PSD proteins Shank3, PSD-95, and Homer (Figs.\u00a03F, S7\u20138). As expected, all three scaffolding proteins were enriched in QIV in CTR spines (Fig.\u00a03G). Such enrichment was not present in CAP1-KO spines. We also determined the centers of mass for phalloidin and the PSD proteins (Fig.\u00a03H). To exclude potential discrepancies due to differences in spine size between CTR and CAP1KO spines, we normalized the centers of mass to that of GFP, which corresponded to the coordinate system\u2019s origin (scheme in Fig.\u00a01K). Consistent with a homogeneous distribution of phalloidin in QI-III from CTR spines, its center of mass was close to the origin with a x-value of \u22121.65 \u00b1 1.63 (n = 26). The centers of mass for PSD-95, Shank3, and Homer in CTR spines were found further on the left, as expected from their enrichment in QIV (x-values: PSD-95: \u22127.68 \u00b1 1.74, n = 30; Shank3: \u22128.88 \u00b1 2.25, n = 26; Homer: \u22128.11 \u00b1 1.38, n = 57). Compared to CTR, the centers\nof mass were different for phalloidin and all three PSD proteins in CAP1-KO spines, thereby confirming an altered distribution of F-actin and PSD proteins (x-values: phalloidin: 3.91 \u00b1 2.00, P < 0.05, n = 29; PSD-95: \u22121.64 \u00b1 2.16, P < 0.05, n = 24; Shank3: 0.89 \u00b1 2.99, P < 0.05, n = 29; Homer: \u22122.18 \u00b1 1.72, P < 0.001, n = 47). Hence, our data revealed an altered F-actin distribution within CAP1-KO spines, suggesting a role for CAP1 in organizing the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, F-actin disorganization was associated with an altered distribution of key PSD proteins. Together, we identified CAP1 as a novel regulator of the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton relevant for both actin dynamics and F-actin organization."

            "text": "Having established CAP1 as a novel postsynaptic actin regulator, we next set out to determine the CAP1-dependent mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis implicated its HFD and CARP domain in regulating actin dynamics [29, 30]. To test the relevance of these domains in spines, we expressed myc-tagged CAP1 variants (WT-CAP1, CAP1-HFD, and CAP1-CARP) together with the volume marker GFP and either Cre-mut or Cre in CAP1flx/flx neurons (Fig.\u00a04A). These experiments also included a CAP1 variant with mutations in a proline-rich domain (CAP1-P1) that reportedly disrupted interaction with the ABP profilin [5, 37]. Myc antibody staining confirmed successful triple transfection of CAP1flx/flx neurons (Fig. S9), and it revealed localization of all mutant variants and of myc-WT-CAP1 in spines from CTR and CAP1-KO neurons (Fig.\u00a04B). Neither WT-CAP1 nor mutant CAP1 variants altered spine density or volume in CTR neurons. Conversely, expression of WT-CAP1 increased spine density by 20% in CAP1-KO neurons, and it reduced spine volume by 21% (Fig.\u00a04C\u2013F, Tab. S2). Both parameters were not different from CTR neurons (P = 0.993 and P = 0.825, respectively). Hence, WT-CAP1 rescued spine density and morphology in CAP1-KO neurons to CTR values. Similarly, CAP1-P1 normalized both parameters in CAP1-KO neurons. Instead, neither CAP1-HFD nor CAP1CARP changed spine density or volume in CAP1-KO neurons. We therefore concluded that HFD and CARP domain, but not the proline-rich domain P1, were relevant for CAP1 function in spines.\nCAP1 and\u00a0cofilin1 interact in vitro and\u00a0in\u00a0cells\nSince previous studies suggested a role for CAP1\u2019s HFD and CARP domain in cofilin1-dependent actin dynamics [29, 30, 57], we next tested whether or not CAP1 was relevant for the function of cofilin1, which emerged as a key postsynaptic actin regulator [6, 17, 19, 22, 53, 55,\nFig. 3 CAP1 controls actin turnover and F-actin distribution in spines.

Moreover, hardly any myc-CAP1-HFD was precipitated in lysates from HT-22 cells co-transfected with GFP-WT-cofilin1, demonstrating the relevance of HFD for the interaction with cofilin1. Together, colocalization of CAP1 and cofilin1 as well as their interaction in hippocampal neurons let us hypothesize that both ABPs cooperate in spines.\nCAP1 and\u00a0cofilin1 cannot compensate the\u00a0other\u2019s inactivation in\u00a0spines\nTo test this hypothesis, we compared under identical experimental conditions spine defects in CAP1-KO neurons to those in neurons lacking cofilin1. We generated cofilin1KO neurons by Cre expression in hippocampal neurons from E18.5 Cfl1flx/flx mice [2], Cre-mut-expressing Cfl1flx/ flx neurons served as CTR. Cofilin1-KO neurons displayed increased spine density and volume (Fig.\u00a06A\u2013C, Tab. S2), similar to spine changes reported for hippocampal neurons in fixed sections from cofilin1-KO mice [57]. Further analysis of cofilin1-KO neurons showed a 20% increase in spine head width, while total spine length or head length were unchanged, similar to CAP1-KO neurons (Fig.\u00a06D\u2013F, Tab. S3). While morphometric analysis of individual spine types did not reveal differences between CTR and cofilin1-KO neurons (Fig. S11A\u2013D, Tab. S3), the spine type distribution in cofilin1-KO neurons was shifted towards larger spines (Fig.\u00a06G, Tab. S4). Together, cofilin1-KO neurons displayed an increase in spine volume and an increased fraction of large spines, very similar to CAP1-KO neurons.\nNext, we tested whether CAP1 and cofilin1 were able to compensate the other\u2019s inactivation in spines. To do so, we overexpressed WT-cofilin1 in CAP1-KO neurons and vice versa WT-CAP1 in cofilin1-KO neurons (Fig.\u00a06H, I). Overexpression of WT-cofilin1 neither restored spine volume nor density in CAP1-KO neurons (Figs.\u00a06J, S11E,\nTable\u00a0S5). Likewise, WT-CAP1 overexpression did not alter spine density or volume in cofilin1-KO neurons (Figs.\u00a06K, S11F, Tab. S5). Together, CAP1 and cofilin1 failed in compensating the other\u2019s absence in spines, thereby supporting our hypothesis that both ABPs cooperate in spines.\nCAP1 and\u00a0cofilin1 are functionally interdependent in\u00a0spines\nTo test this hypothesis, we analyzed double KO (dKO) neurons lacking both ABPs, which we achieved by Cre expression in CAP1flx/flx/Cfl1flx/flx neurons. Cre-mutexpressing CAP1flx/flx/Cfl1flx/flx neurons served as CTR (Fig.\u00a07A). Different from CAP1-KO or cofilin1-KO neurons, spine density was only very slightly reduced in dKO neurons (Fig.\u00a07B, Tab. S6). However, spine volume was increased by roughly 40% (Fig.\u00a07C, Tab. S6). Notably, spine volume in dKO neurons did not differ from CAP1KO or cofilin1-KO neurons (Tab. S6). Hence, compound inactivation of both ABPs did not cause an additive effect in spine volume.\nA detailed spine morphometric analysis in dKO neurons revealed a 45% increase in spine head width, while total spine length or head length were unchanged (Fig.\u00a07D\u2013F, Tab. S3). While morphology of filopodia-like and stubby spines was normal in dKO (Fig. S12A\u2013D, Tab. S3), thin spine length was reduced by 14%, and head width of mushroom-like spines was increased by 22%. Spine categorization according to their morphology revealed a shift towards larger spines in dKO neurons (Fig.\u00a07G, Tab. S4). Together, spine size and the fraction of large spines were increased in dKO neurons, very similar to those changes we found in CAP1-KO and cofilin1-KO neurons.\nTo finally test whether CAP1 and cofilin1 require each other to elicit their effects in spines, we expressed either WT-CAP1, WT-cofilin1 or both ABP in dKO neurons and determined spine volume as a readout. Neither WT-CAP1 nor WT-cofilin1 reduced spine volume in dKO neurons (Fig.\u00a07H\u2013J, Tab. S6). Instead, spine volume in dKO neurons was rescued upon co-expression of WT-CAP1 and WT-cofilin1. We also expressed WT-cofilin1 together with aforementioned CAP1 mutants in dKO neurons and found that spine volume was rescued upon expression with CAP1-P1. While expression of WT-cofilin1 and CAP1CARP slightly reduced spine volume in dKO neurons, expression of WT-cofilin1 together with CAP1-HFD failed to normalize spine volume. In summary, these data demonstrated that CAP1 and cofilin1 cooperated in the regulation of spine morphology. Further, they revealed functional interdependence of CAP1 and cofilin1, which depends on CAP1\u2019s HFD (Fig.\u00a08).\nFig. 6 Cofilin1-KO neurons display increases in spine size and fraction of large spines.

            "text": "The ABP CAP1 is a multidomain protein with largely unknown physiological functions. Here we report CAP1 expression throughout postnatal brain development and enrichment in dendritic spine heads. By STED microscopy and live cell imaging in hippocampal neurons from genetargeted mice, we identified CAP1 as a novel postsynaptic actin regulator relevant for spine density and morphology. Mechanistically, we found the conserved HFD to be essential for CAP1\u2019s function in spines and for its interaction with the key synaptic actin regulator cofilin1. Rescue experiments in dKO lacking CAP1 and cofilin1 revealed that both ABP not only cooperated in regulating spine morphology but also demonstrated their mutual functional dependence in the postsynaptic compartment.\nThe yeast CAP ortholog has been recognized as an ABP three decades ago (for review: [46, 58, 59], but significant progress in its molecular functions has been achieved only recently, predominantly by exploiting recombinant proteins or mutant yeast strains [24, 25, 29, 30, 65]. In a current model of actin regulation, CAP interacts with cofilin-decorated F-actin via its HFD and thereby accelerates dissociation of the terminal actin subunit [29, 30]. Subsequently, G-actin-cofilin complexes are passed on to CAP\u2019s CARP domain that, together with its WH2 domain, releases cofilin from this complex and promotes nucleotide (ATP for ADP) exchange on G-actin, which is required for actin polymerization. While these studies provided exciting novel insights into CAP\u2019s molecular activities, the cellular and physiological functions of mammalian CAP largely remained unknown, also because appropriate animal models were lacking. This held true specifically for CAP1, while earlier mouse studies implicated CAP2 in heart physiology and skeletal muscle development [9, 12, 28, 47]. Recently, a TALEN-engineered systemic CAP1-KO mouse model has been generated, but these mice died during embryonic development and analysis of heterozygous mutants solely revealed a role of CAP1 in lipoprotein metabolism [23]. Moreover, we recently reported impaired neuron connectivity in brain-specific CAP1-KO\nmice, which was likely caused by compromised growth cone function and delayed neuron differentiation [61, 63]. Instead, the function of CAP1 in differentiated neurons or synapses has not been studied to date.\nIn the present study, we demonstrated important functions for CAP1 in postsynaptic actin regulation, in very good agreement with the in\u00a0vitro studies outlined above. Specifically, FRAP revealed a role for CAP1 in postsynaptic actin turnover and STED nanoscopy in postsynaptic F-actin organization. Interestingly, actin defects were associated with an altered sub-spinous distribution of the PSD proteins PSD-95, Shank3 and Homer, thereby suggesting a role for CAP1 in shaping the postsynaptic machinery, which will be investigated in future studies. While we here implicated CAP1 in synaptic actin regulation, we earlier showed its relevance for actin dynamics in growth cones [61, 63]. We therefore conclude a general requirement of CAP1 in neuronal actin regulation both during differentiation and in differentiated neurons, similar to cofilin1 [2, 14, 45, 55, 57, 62]. By PLA we found colocalization (within 40\u00a0nm) of CAP1 and cofilin1 in the dendritic compartment, and our co-immunoprecipitation experiments validated their physical interaction in the hippocampus, which required CAP1\u2019s HFD. By rescue experiments in dKO neurons lacking CAP1 and cofilin1, we demonstrated a cooperation of both ABP in regulating spine morphology. Moreover, we showed mutual functional dependence of CAP1 and cofilin1 in spines, similar to their functional interdependence in growth cones [61]. Hence, an intimate interaction of CAP1 and cofilin1 is likely of general relevance for neuronal actin regulation.\nWhile this study reports an important synaptic function for CAP1, studies of the past two decades recognized cofilin1 as an important regulator of synapse physiology, synaptic plasticity, brain function and behavior [6, 13, 17, 22, 56, 57, 60, 77]. In line with these publications, we report increased spine density and volume in cofilin1-KO neurons. Collectively, these studies let cofilin1 emerge as a key regulator of spine morphology and as a major final point of signaling output for actin regulation in spines [68]. This emphasized the necessity for regulatory mechanisms that tightly control cofilin1 activity to ensure proper synapse physiology and brain function. In fact, dysregulation of cofilin1 activity has been linked to synaptic and behavioral deficits associated with ASD or ADHD [10, 78]. To date, a plethora of signaling molecules ranging from the Rho GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA and their effectors PAK1, ROCK, and LIMK1 to the phosphatase calcineurin and its effectors PI3K and slingshot have been implicated in synaptic cofilin1 phosphorylation that controls actin binding (for review: [3, 56, 68]. Additionally, synaptic cofilin1 activity is regulated by molecules that control its recruitment into spines and by translation within the dendritic compartment [11, 49, 51]. By demonstrating mutual functional dependence of cofilin1\nFig. 7 Cooperation of CAP1 and cofilin1 in spines. A Micrographs of GFP-expressing CTR and double-KO (dKO) neurons.

Further, our finding that CAP1 was essential for cofilin1 activity in spines opened up a new avenue for the modulation of cofilin1 activity and, hence, actin dynamics in spines. Notably, CAP1 comprises several conserved domains allowing interaction with molecules others than actin and cofilin1. To date, a number of interaction partners have been found for CAP1 or its homologs (for review: [26, 46, 58, 59], including established regulators of spine morphology, such as the ABP profilin [1, 32, 39, 40, 70], the proteinase MMP-9 [71, 73], the tyrosine kinases Abl1 and Abl2 [33, 36, 44], focal adhesion kinase [42, 67], and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3; [43, 48]. Normalization of spine parameters in CAP1-KO neurons upon expression of a CAP1 variant with a mutated prolinerich motif (CAP1-P1) suggested that its proline-rich domain and, hence, its interaction with profilin were not relevant in spines. Nevertheless, it will be exciting to test in future studies whether other proteins interact with or regulate CAP1 in spines and whether these proteins control CAP1-cofilin1 interaction and synaptic actin dynamics. This will also include post-translational modifications of CAP1, since its phosphorylation by various kinases including GSK3 reportedly modulated binding of cofilin1 and actin [75, 76].\nApart from CAP1, mammals express a second family member, CAP2, with restricted expression pattern and abundance in striated muscles and brain [58, 59]. Similar to CAP1, CAP2 is expressed in the postnatal brain and located in spine heads from cortical and hippocampal neurons [31, 49]. However, while studies in mutant mice established important CAP2 functions in heart physiology and skeletal muscle development [9, 12, 28, 47], neuronal CAP2 functions are less clear. Increased spine density has been reported\nfor cerebral cortex neurons lacking CAP2, but this study unfortunately lacked a detailed spine morphometric analysis and did not provide mechanistic insights [31]. Conversely, spine density was unchanged upon shRNA-mediated CAP2 knockdown (CAP2-KD) in hippocampal neurons, and spine length and width were both slightly increased [49]. However, compared to roughly 30% increased spine size in CAP1-KO neurons, the effect of CAP2-KD on spine morphology was rather mild, suggesting that CAP1 is the key family member in spines. Interestingly, this study revealed CAP2-mediated cofilin1 recruitment into spines upon induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), which depended on disulfide bond-mediated CAP2 dimerization [49]. Remarkably, CAP2-dependent recruitment of cofilin1 into spines was required for LTPtriggered spine remodeling and potentiation of synaptic transmission [49]. Although spine changes in CAP2-KD neurons suggested a role for CAP2 in synaptic actin dynamics, this has not been directly tested in this study. Moreover, it remained to be tested whether CAP2 and cofilin1 cooperate in regulating spine morphology in basal conditions and whether CAP2 was essential for synaptic cofilin1 activity as both shown in the present study for CAP1. Furthermore, it needs to be tested whether CAP1 and its interaction with cofilin1 are relevant for spine morphological changes associated with synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, a model in which both CAP1 and CAP2 cooperate with cofilin1 in synaptic actin dynamics, spine morphology, and structural plasticity is very appealing, and it will be exciting in future studies to dissect CAP1- vs CAP2-specific mechanisms and to test whether or not CAP1 and CAP2 cooperate and/or are functionally redundant in spines.\nIn summary, we here identified CAP1 as an essential novel actin regulator in excitatory synapses that is relevant\nFig. 8 Functional interdependence of CAP1 and cofilin1 in regulating dendritic spine size. A Scheme showing spine enlargement in neurons lacking CAP1, cofilin1, or both ABP as well as normalization of spine size in double KO neurons upon expression of WT-CAP1 and cofilin1, but not upon expression of CAP1-HFD and cofilin1. B The present study provides evidence for an interaction of the actin regu-\nlators CAP1 and cofilin1 in control of dendritic spine morphology. Our data and previous in\u00a0vitro studies that unraveled a cooperation of CAP1 with cofilin1 in actin regulation [29, 30] let us hypothesize a cooperation of CAP1 and cofilin1 in postsynaptic actin regulation as well as functional interdependence of both ABP\nFunctional interdependence of\u00a0the\u00a0actin regulators CAP1 and\u00a0cofilin1 in\u00a0control of\u00a0dendritic\u2026\n1 3\nPage 15 of 21 558\nfor organization and dynamics of postsynaptic F-actin and thereby controls spine density and morphology. Mechanistically, our data revealed mutual functional dependence of CAP1 and cofilin1 in spine morphology, thereby unravelling a novel synaptic actin regulatory mechanism. Our data let us hypothesize that CAP1 is equally important as cofilin1 for brain function and behavior, and that CAP1 dysregulation may contribute to the pathologies of neuropsychiatric disorders as it has been shown for cofilin1 [10, 78]."

DIV1617 neurons were imaged with 63 \u00d7 objective at 35\u00a0\u00b0C in 1 \u00d7 HBSS (Gibco; supplemented with 4\u00a0mM NaCO3 and 2\u00a0mM CaCl2). The following imaging settings were applied: format 512 \u00d7 512 pixel, speed 700\u00a0Hz, 2-line averaging, pinhole 300\u00a0\u00b5m, 15% of argon laser power, bleaching with 100%, and image acquisition with 3\u20137% power intensity of AOTF 488\u00a0nM (FRAP wizard). Imaging/bleaching program: prebleaching 5 \u00d7 2\u00a0s, bleaching 5 \u00d7 1.5\u00a0s (3\u00a0\u00b5m diameter), and postbleaching 20 \u00d7 2\u00a0s, 10 \u00d7 5\u00a0s and 20 \u00d7 10\u00a0s.\nThe image series were analyzed using FIJI as previously reported [39]. Briefly, background and bleaching correction was applied and normalized fluorescence intensity for each time point was calculated. Nonlinear curve fitting (one phase exponential association) of the fluorescence intensity was performed with GraphPad Prism, where the net recovery after photobleaching is provided by the following equation: Y = Y0 + (Plateau \u2212 Y0) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 exp(\u2212 K \u00d7 x)), where Y0 is the Y value when time is zero directly after the bleaching impulse and Plateau is the Y value at infinite times, expressed as a fraction of the fluorescence before bleaching and was used to determine the dynamic actin pool (F-actin dynamic). The stable pool (F-actin stable) is the fraction of fluorescence that does not recover within the imaging period of 300\u00a0s calculated as 1-(F-actin dynamic), K is the rate constant, and T is the time constant, expressed in s; it is computed as the reciprocal of K."

Both the red and far-red channel were depleted using a 775\u00a0nm laser (PFL-40-3000-775-B1R). Pinhole size was set to 1AU. Gated detection was applied for both channels.\nPostsynaptic distribution of CAP1 was analyzed in mushroom-like spines of two independent DIV16 hippocampal cultures using a custom-written script in MATLAB (R2015a, MathWorks, Inc) that has been described previously [41]. For analysis, phalloidin (Fig.\u00a01J\u2013L) or GFP (Fig.\u00a03F\u2013H) signals were slightly oversaturated to facilitate outlining the spine head. Postsynaptic distribution of phalloidin, Shank3, PSD-95, and Homer in mushroom-like spines from CTR and CAP1-KO neurons has been analyzed in three independent DIV16 hippocampal cultures.
