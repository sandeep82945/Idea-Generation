1. **Investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of SEOMs in patients with hyperthyroidism:** Conduct a larger-scale study to determine the prevalence of SEOMs in patients with hyperthyroidism and assess the potential correlation between the presence of SEOMs and the severity of thyroid eye disease.


2. **Explore the role of SEOMs in the development and progression of thyroid eye disease:** Investigate whether SEOMs can contribute to the development or progression of thyroid eye disease by conducting longitudinal studies that follow patients with SEOMs and hyperthyroidism over time to monitor changes in ocular symptoms and signs.


3. **Evaluate the impact of SEOMs on ocular motility and visual function:** Conduct studies to assess the impact of SEOMs on ocular motility and visual function in patients with hyperthyroidism, including measurements of strabismus, ductions, and vergence, as well as visual acuity and visual field testing.


4. **Investigate the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of SEOMs:** Conduct genetic and molecular studies to identify potential genetic mutations or variations associated with the development of SEOMs, and explore the role of specific genes or signaling pathways in the formation of these anomalous muscles.


5. **Develop novel treatment strategies for SEOMs in patients with hyperthyroidism:** Explore potential treatment options for SEOMs in patients with hyperthyroidism, such as targeted therapies aimed at reducing inflammation or fibrosis, or surgical interventions to address the anatomical abnormalities associated with SEOMs.
