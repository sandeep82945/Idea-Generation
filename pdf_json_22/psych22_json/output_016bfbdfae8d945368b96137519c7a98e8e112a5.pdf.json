    "abstractText": "Purpose. The purpose of this research is to test the psychometric properties and factorial structure of the Addiction-like Eating Behaviors Scale (AEBS) in an Italian sample of adults with severe obesity seeking treatment for weight reduction and the general population, and to examine the measurement invariance of the tool by comparing a clinical and a nonclinical sample. Methods. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was initially conducted to test the factorial structure of the Italian version of the AEBS (AEBS-IT) on a total of 953 participants. Following this, the measurement invariance and psychometric properties of the tool AEBS-IT were assessed on both inpatients with severe obesity (n = 502) and individuals from the general population (n = 451). Reliability and convergent validity analysis were also run. Results. CFA revealed a bi-factor structure for the AEBSIT, which also showed good reliability and positive correlations with food addiction (through the mYFAS2.0 symptom count), binge-eating symptoms, compulsive eating behavior, and dysfunctional eating patterns and the individuals\u2019 body mass index (BMI). Moreover, the tool was invariant across populations. Conclusion. This study provided evidence that the AEBS-IT is a valid and reliable measure of FA in both clinical and nonclinical samples.",

            "text": "Obesity is on the rise, and it is predicted to rise to nearly half the global population by 2030. Recent statistics suggested that 50% of men and 55% of women, globally, are overweight or obese [1]. This is problematic given the adverse health and social factors associated with obesity, such as decreased quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality [2,3]. One of the central causes of obesity is an energy imbalance of calories consumed and expended [1]. However, the onset and development of obesity are complex and include several factors such as psychological, sociological, biological, evolutionary, economic, and institutional factors [4,5]. Obesity is a preventable and treatable condition, with strategies frequently focusing on reducing sedentary lifestyles and improving dietary intake, however, long-term success is limited, and relapse is frequent [6]. Therefore\u2014to inform clinical interventions and contribute to health prevention strategies\u2014it is important to concentrate on other explanations that may contribute to the behavioral phenomenon of food overconsumption. The last two decades have been characterized by increased interest in the construct of Food Addiction (FA), a substance-use disorder (SUD) characterized by\nNutrients 2023, 15, 104. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15010104 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2023, 15, 104 2 of 19\nexcessive overeating of hyper-palatable and high-energy-density foods\u2014including sugars and fats\u2014often comprising patterns of loss of control and intense food cravings that have the potential to generate dependence [7,8]. Consistent with this idea, according to criteria for SUD, Gearhardt et al. (2009) [9,10] developed the first measure of FA, the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) and its subsequent versions (i.e., YFAS2.0 and mYFAS2.0), a self-reported questionnaire adapted from the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV-TR [11] and DSM-5 [12\u201316]. Since its publication, the YFAS and its subsequent versions have been used as the instrument of choice for measuring FA\u2014contributing to stimulating research and establishing preliminary findings in the field [17\u201319]. However, some authors have proposed that the criteria for SUDs should not be applied to food\u2014suggesting several fundamental differences between drugs and food [20\u201322]. For instance, they consider addiction symptoms, such as tolerance, withdrawal syndrome, interference in daily activities, or use in physically hazardous situations, to not be applicable to food consumption and to be more specific to alcohol and drugs [7,23]. Indeed, contrary to alcohol and drugs, food is vital, and considering it an addictive substance should be a matter of concern. Consequently, Hebebrand and colleagues (2014) proposed that FA should be restructured as a behavioral addiction\u2014proposing the denomination of \u201ceating addiction\u201d (EA) [7]. Indeed, behavioral addictions are related to a substantial excitation generated by pleasurable stimuli and a low capacity for inhibitory control, favoring the repeated engagement in that behavior, even in the face of eventual harm [24]. Consistent with this idea, the Addiction-like Eating Behaviour Scale (AEBS) was developed as an alternative to a substance-based conceptualization of FA [21]. Instead of relying upon the SUD model, this 15-item scale aims to quantify the core cognitive and behavioral processes underpinning addictive patterns of the over-consumption of food via two subscales (\u201cappetitive drive\u201d, 9 items, and \u201clow dietary control\u201d, 6 items) consistent with the dual-process theories of motivation related to FA/EA: (1) an increased responsivity to reward-related cues coupled with (2) a diminished ability to exert inhibitory control [25]. In its validation study, the AEBS showed good convergent validity with binge eating, emotional eating, and disordered eating as well as good divergent validity with alcohol addiction and a measure of behavioral inhibition and activation. The instrument also explained body mass index (BMI) variances above that were accounted for by both the YFAS and the Binge Eating Scale (BES). These results were successfully replicated in a clinical and community sample of French\u2013Canadian participants [26], and the AEBS also demonstrated good reliability and validity in evaluating addictive eating behaviors among the general population in Brazil [27]. Since the AEBS is not yet available for use by Italian clinicians and researchers, the purpose of the present study is twofold. First, it aims to examine the factorial structure and the psychometric proprieties of the Italian version of the AEBS (AEBS-IT) within a clinical sample of adults with severe obesity and within the general population. The second aim is to test the measurement invariance of the tool between clinical and nonclinical samples."

Individuals with severe obesity were enrolled within the first week of a one-month weight reduction and rehabilitation program at the IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano San Giuseppe Hospital, Verbania (Italy). In line with previous studies [15,38], participants from the general population were randomly enrolled in Milan and Padua using the snowball sampling technique, personal invitations, and advertisements placed around the university and in caf\u00e9s and libraries.

            "text": "Demographic (age and gender) and clinical parameters (weight and height\u2014used to calculate the individuals\u2019 BMI) were collected, and the Italian version of the following self-report questionnaires were administered:\n2.5.1. The Addiction-Like Eating Behavioral Scale\u2014Italian Version (AEBS-IT)\nThe AEBS-IT [21] is a 15-item questionnaire used to assess eating-related behavioral addiction. Items are answered on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree or never) to 5 (strongly agree or always). The AEBS-IT is divided into two subscales: \u201cappetite drive\u201d includes nine items for a possible score ranging from 9 to 45 and \u201clow dietary control\u201d includes six items for a possible score ranging from 6 to 30. All items can be summed to obtain a global score ranging from 15 to 75. A higher score represents more frequent and severe addictive-like eating behaviors. The AEBS-IT has been shown to be a valid and reliable tool for quantifying the behavioral features of an\nNutrients 2023, 15, 104 4 of 19\n\u2018eating addiction\u2019 and it is correlated positively with other measures of maladaptive eating, such as the YFAS and BMI [21].\n2.5.2. The Modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS2.0)\nThe mYFAS 2.0 [39,40] is a questionnaire assessing the presence of addictive eating behaviors. It comprises 13 questions evaluated on an 8-point scale that range from 0 (never) to 7 (every day): 11 items reflect the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for SUD [16] while 2 items assess food-related impairment and distress experienced by the person during the past 12 months. Each item is scored dichotomously (0 = did not meet the criterion, 1 = met the criterion) according to the threshold determined by Gearhardt and collaborators (2017) [40]. The mYFAS 2.0 provides two different scores: the symptom count version (scores ranging from 0 to 11), which sums up the diagnostic criteria that the subject meets; and the diagnostic score, which requires the presence of impairment/distress criteria. To make an FA diagnosis, both scores are used (mild = 2\u20133 symptoms plus impairment or distress, moderate = 4\u20135 symptoms plus impairment or distress, severe = 6 or more symptoms plus impairment or distress) [12]. In this study, the mYFAS2.0 showed adequate internal consistency: the KR20 coefficient was 0.857.\n2.5.3. The Binge Eating Scale (BES)\nThe BES [41,42] is a questionnaire measuring binge-eating severity in both community [10] and clinical samples [43]. It comprises 16 items: eight items that describe behavioral manifestations of BED (i.e., eating fast or consuming large amounts of food) and eight items focused on associated feelings and cognitions (i.e., fear of not stopping eating). Each question has 3\u20134 separate responses increasing in severity grouped into two subscales (FC\u2014Feelings/Cognitions; and B\u2014Behaviors) and a total score [43]. Assigning to each statement a numerical value ranging from 0 to 3 points (0 = no severity in BED symptoms, 3 = serious problems in terms of BED symptoms), the BES total score ranges from 0 to 46: a score of less than 17 points indicates minimal BE problems; a score between 18 and 26 points indicates moderate BED; and a score of more than 27 points indicates severe BED [44]. Studies carried out in the past decade, mainly with individuals with obesity, have shown that the BES is very sensitive and specific in distinguishing between compulsive and normal eaters [45,46], and a large number of investigations support its reliability and validity as a measure of eating-related pathology [41,42,47,48]. In this study, the BES showed adequate internal consistency. Indeed, Cronbach\u2019s alphas were 0.901, 0.816, and 0.835 for the BES Total scale, the FC scale, and the B scale, respectively.\n2.5.4. The Measure of Eating Compulsivity\u2014Italian Version (MEC10-IT)\nThe MEC10-IT [49,50] is a measure of compulsive eating within the FA framework. It comprises 10 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale with partial semantic autonomy (from 0 = \u201cVery Untrue\u201d to 4 = \u201cVery True\u201d) and higher scores corresponding to a higher eating compulsivity. In its original validation study [49], the MEC10 displayed adequate reliability (\u03b1 = 0.946). Similarly, in the present study, the internal consistency of the tool was adequate, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha equal to 0.941.\n2.5.5. The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ)\nThe DEBQ [51,52] is a questionnaire measuring behaviors and attitudes related to ED in both general [10,53] and clinical populations [54]. It comprises 33 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = \u201cnever\u201d to 5 = \u201cvery often\u201d) and grouped into three subscales: Restrained Eating (RE), Emotional Eating (EE), and External Eating (ExE), plus a total score. The DEBQ has been shown to be an adequately reliable and valid measure of eating-related pathology with a strong three-factor structure, high internal consistency, and high test-retest reliability after 4 weeks [51\u201354].\nNutrients 2023, 15, 104 5 of 19\nIn this study, Cronbach\u2019s alphas were 0.934, 0.929, 0.969, and 0.835 for the total scale, the RE scale, the EE scale, and the ExE scale, respectively.\n2.5.6. Statistical Analyses\nStatistical analyses were run with R software [55,56], and the following packages were also used: corrplot [57], lavaan [58,59], plotROC [60], pROC [61], psych [62], psychTools [63], semTools [64], and tidyverse [65]. Graphical representations were performed with the ggplot2 package [66]. The DWLS (diagonal weighted least square) estimator was employed to evaluate the factorial structure of the AEBS-IT [67\u201371]. Model fit was assessed using (A) the Chi-square statistic (\u03c72), (B) the Root-Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), (C) the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and (D) the Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR) [67\u201369,71,72]. To evaluate the goodness of fit, the following cut-off criteria were used: (A) statistical non-significance of the \u03c72, (B) an RMSEA lower than 0.08, (C) a CFI higher than 0.95, and (D) an SRMR lower than 0.08 [67\u201369,71,72]. According to its original validation study [21], a first-order model comprising twofactor was specified: 9 items loaded onto the \u2018appetite drive\u2019 latent factor (from item#1 to item#9) and 6 items filled into the \u2018low dietary control\u2019 latent factor (from item#10 to item#15). Moreover, considering that the original validation study assumed a \u2018general factor\u2019 (i.e., total score), two alternative models were additionally tested. First, a single factor model was verified: all the 15 items of the AEBS-IT loaded onto the latent factor \u2018Addiction-like eating behavior\u2019 (general factor, only). Second, a bi-factor structure was set: 9 items loaded onto the \u2018appetite drive\u2019 latent factor (from item#1 to item#9), 6 items filled in the \u2018low dietary control\u2019 latent factor (from item#10 to item#15), and all the 15 items loaded onto an overall factor named \u2018Addiction-like eating behavior\u2019 (total score). To select the best factorial structure (namely, the best model), a model comparison analysis was performed. The following set of criteria and cutoffs for model equality were employed: DIFFTEST (equal to \u2206\u03c72; p-value > 0.050) and \u2206CFI (<0.010). Considering the great sensibility to the sample size of the \u03c72, the overpass of the \u2206CFI cut-off criteria was considered to be evidence of model inadequateness\u2014combined with worse fit indices [67,72\u201375]. Measurement invariance (MI) analysis for categorical data was run to test the betweengroup (inpatients with severe obesity vs. general population) invariance of the factorial structure of the AEBS-IT [76]. According to guidelines [72,76,77], four (nested) models were defined and their model parameters were sequentially constrained to equality: Configural Invariance (Model 1: equal factorial structure); Metric Invariance (Model 2: equal factorial structure and item factor loadings); Scalar Invariance (Model 3: equal factorial structure, item factor loadings, and item thresholds); Means Invariance (Model 4: equal factorial structure, item factor loadings, item thresholds, and latent means) [72,74\u201377]. These nested models were sequentially compared. Model calculations were done by means of the aforementioned test differences: DIFFTEST and \u2206CFI. Additionally, the same rule-of-thumb for model inadequateness was applied. The AEBS-IT internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach\u2019s alpha (\u03b1) and McDonald\u2019s omega (\u03c9) [78\u201380]. Moreover, the adjusted item-total correlation was calculated [81\u201383]. In addition, item discriminant power (IDP) was performed to assess the capacity of the items to differentiate between individuals with a low or high level of the construct that has been measured [84,85]. For each subject, the total score and its quartile rank were first computed. Subsequently, independent sample t-tests\u2014and related effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d) [86]\u2014were determined to evaluate IDP by means of the scale-total score as the dependent variable and its lowest and highest quartile as the grouping variable [84,85]. Convergent validity was calculated with the Pearson correlation coefficient [81] and read using Cohen\u2019s benchmarks: r < 0.10, trivial; r from 0.10 to 0.30, small; r from 0.30 to 0.50, moderate; and r > 0.50, large [86].\nNutrients 2023, 15, 104 6 of 19\nMoreover, a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve was run to evaluate the accuracy of the general dimension of the AEBS-IT (\u2018addiction-like eating behavioral\u2019 scale) to differentiate between (A) individuals without FA and individuals with FA as well as (B) individuals without BED and individuals with BED [87,88]. The global accuracy-validity of the AEBS-IT was estimated with the area under the ROC curve (AUC; 5000 stratified bootstrap resamples). The AUC was interpreted with Swets\u2019 benchmarks: AUC = 0.50, null; AUC from 0.51 to 0.70, small; AUC from 0.71 to 0.90, moderate; AUC from 0.91 to 0.99, large; and AUC = 1.00, perfect accuracy [89,90]. Moreover, sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and accuracy (ACC) were computed for each AEBS-IT cut-off point [87,88]."

            "text": "The use of the AEBS-IT is important in both research and clinical fields as it is the only tool available enabling the evaluation of behavioral addiction to eating.\nNutrients 2023, 15, 104 13 of 19\nThis study investigates, for the first time, the psychometric proprieties of this tool among the Italian population and tests its factorial structure, also in the comparison between a clinical sample of adults with obesity seeking treatment for weight reduction and the general population. In terms of the two samples combined, results confirmed that the bi-factor model of the AEBS-IT has an excellent fit to the data\u2014meaning the nature of the construct of behavioral addiction to eating is adequately measured with the items comprising the tool. MI analysis also revealed this to be true in both clinical and community samples, separately. The AEBS-IT\u2019s items were equivalently related to the latent factor in each sample, and the two samples had the same expected item response at the same absolute level of the trait. These results suggest that inpatients with obesity and the general population interpreted the items in the same way (the factorial structure was equal across samples), with the same strength (items were related to the latent construct equally between the two samples), and with the same starting point (item thresholds were equal between the two samples). However, the latent trait was not equally distributed (latent means were different between the two samples). Thus, inpatients with severe obesity and the general population were perfectly comparable (equal items threshold), but with caution (different latent means) [91\u201395]. Therefore, the AEBS-IT can be employed in clinical and research practice to confront outcomes resulting from these two populations. Moreover, IDP analysis exhibited that the 15 items of the AEBS-IT discriminated well between respondents with low and high addiction-like eating behaviors, and demonstrated the capacity of each item to signify its latent construct. Further, reliability analyses were run, showing good results for both subscales and the AEBS-IT total score. Statistically significant positive correlations were also found between all the dimensions of the AEBS-IT, the mYFAS2.0 symptom count, the BES subscales, the MEC10-IT total score, the DEBQ factors, and the individuals\u2019 BMI\u2014demonstrating the tool\u2019s good convergent validity. These findings corroborate the link between the construct of addiction-like eating behaviors, FA, BED symptoms, compulsive eating, dysfunctional eating patterns, and the individuals\u2019 BMI. Not surprisingly, the highest correlations were observed between the AEBS-IT scores, and both the mYFAS2.0 symptom count and BES scores\u2014thus confirming the finding of the validation study carried out by Legendre et al. (2020) in both clinical and community samples among Canadian adults [26]. Further, in a recent examination of the YFAS in a clinical sample of patients with obesity with BED, a diagnosis of FA was met by 57% of patients, and a higher number of FA symptoms was related to more frequent binge-eating episodes [96,97]. Additionally, the compulsive overeating characteristic of BED has been shown to statistically predict FA diagnosis based on YFAS criteria in individuals with obesity in several investigations [98,99]. These results corroborate the partial overlap between the constructs of compulsive eating measured using the MEC10-IT, with a diagnosis of FA based on addiction criteria and BED already documented in the previous studies [26,49,100,101], and also highlight the important relationships between addiction-like eating behaviors with BED and compulsive eating patterns. Indeed, the AEBS-IT total score and its subscales showed higher correlations with all the BES dimensions and the construct of eating compulsivity measured using the MEC10-IT than those displayed by the mYFAS2.0 symptom count, while FA measured using the mYFAS2.0 and FA based on the behavioral models show a moderate correlation. The lowest correlations were, instead, observed between the AEBS-IT subscales and total score and the DEBQ restrained eating dimension. Specifically, a negative correlation was detected between the AEBS-IT low dietary control factor and the above DEBQ dimension. Accordingly, previous investigations showed small, significant negative correlations or non-significant correlation coefficients of FA based on the substance abuse\nNutrients 2023, 15, 104 14 of 19\nmodel (measured with the YFAS) with dietary restraint (measured with the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire\u2014TFEQ or the Eating Disorder Examination\u2014EDE) [12,96,102]. Still, for the first time, the construct of EA is measured here through the AEBS-IT, while the presence of eating disorder psychopathology was assessed using the DEBQ. These findings further corroborate the association with mYFAS2.0 and AEBS-IT conceptualization of EA. Still, whether these conditions represent forms of compulsive eating supported by different mechanisms or represent two different facets of a unique underlying phenomenon needs to be further assessed in future studies. In fact, the heterogeneity characterizing the sample (i.e., diagnosis and demographics/clinical parameters) and the cross-sectional design of this study make it difficult to derive any conclusion or causal relation between variables. Lastly, the ROC analyses revealed that the AEBS-IT represents a valid screening/ diagnostic tool for the detection of addiction-like eating behaviors in people with severe obesity. Indeed, it presented high accuracy (AUC = 0.819), sensitivity (0.807), and specificity (0.701) in discriminating between individuals with FA and those without FA. Similarly, the measure demonstrated to be able to successfully detect BED symptoms among adults with severe obesity seeking treatment for weight reductions\u2014as it showed high accuracy (AUC = 0.895), sensitivity (0.885), and high specificity (0.738) in discriminating among individuals with and without BED. In this regard, the magnitude of the effect size (AUC) suggests a substantial (but not total) overlap between food addiction, binge-eating behaviors, and eating addiction, suggesting that these three psychological constructs may be somewhat intersecting and not necessarily mutually exclusive. Indeed, food addiction\u2014conceptualized as SUD\u2014does not necessarily exclude overeating and binge-eating behaviors and\u2014at the same time\u2014does not necessarily exclude a drive toward hunger (appetitive drive) that can lead to low diet control through behavioral dependence on the act of eating. Some limitations of this study should be highlighted. Despite the presence of a large number of subjects from the clinical population (inpatients with severe obesity), a convenience snowball sampling enrollment procedure was used for the individuals from the general population. However, MI analysis suggests that the factorial structure of AEBS is invariant across the two samples, at the level of the thresholds. Moreover, the cross-sectional research design and the use of self-report questionnaires did not allow for testing of the possible changes of the AEBS over time nor its temporal stability (e.g., longitudinal MI and test-retest reliability) and its predictive validity. Future studies may identify the recurring patterns of EA by creating latent psychological profiles. Another potential limitation is related to the variability in the age of both samples\u2014which could lead to changes in the subjects\u2019 metabolism and, thus, their tendency to engage in EArelated behaviors. Future studies, including longitudinal ones, could control for this variable and use it as a predictor/outcome to create possible explanatory models of EA behaviors. In addition, future studies could investigate the interaction of confounding factors (e.g., age, BMI, gender, etc.) on the latent dimensions of AEBS. Lastly, future studies might also consider examining possible cross-cultural similarities and differences in the conceptualization of EA through AEBS (i.e., cross-cultural MI). Despite these limitations, this study still has several strengths, both methodological and clinical. It is noteworthy that this is the first study validating the AEBS-IT, allowing for the assessment of EA to be conducted with accuracy and parsimony. Additionally, the relatively small number of items allows the AEBS-IT to be more easily included in longer assessment batteries, both in clinical and research practice. About the methodological strengths, the CFA revealed that the best factorial of the AEBS-IT is the one comprising two specific factors (\u2018appetite drive\u2019 and \u2018low dietary control\u2019) and an overarching latent dimension (\u2018eating addiction\u2019). Regarding clinical strengths, the AEBS-IT has significant clinical impact and implications, as it represents a useful assessment tool for clinicians because EA seems to be a transdiagnostic construct shared by various EDs and psychological difficulties related to eating and feeding attitudes. Thus, assessing EA is important due to its multiple\nNutrients 2023, 15, 104 15 of 19\nroles: EA may be the cause, the result, and a maintenance factor of psychological suffering and dysfunctional behaviors in EDs, and this provides useful information for both the conceptualization and treatment of clinical conditions. Moreover, the AEBS-IT provides useful information to allow for better understandings of psychological difficulties and the tailoring of specific psychological interventions."

            "text": "Conceptualizing FA as a behavioral addiction\u2014namely, \u2018eating addiction\u2019 (EA)\u2014the AEBS-IT represents a psychometrically sound instrument able to measure the presence of addictive-like eating behavioral patterns in both clinical and nonclinical samples. Indeed, this tool demonstrated good validity and reliability in both patients with severe obesity and the community sample, and might be used by researchers and clinicians to assess FA [103]. Considering that the AEBS-IT\u2014unlike the YFAS/YFAS2.0/mYFAS2.0\u2014is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, its good sensitivity to clinical populations (i.e., a good capacity to detect people with FA) further supports its utilization. Additionally\u2014besides being moderately correlated with the FA-substance-based model\u2014it shows high associations with compulsive eating, BED, and dysfunctional eating patterns that are above those displayed by the mYFAS 2.0. This suggests that, despite the YFAS representing the most widely used measure of FA, the AEBS-IT nonetheless properly reflects the behavioral correlates of the EA phenomenon (i.e., compulsive overeating), its characteristics, and related psychiatric comorbidities. Moreover, the term \u201cEating Addiction\u201d would be more appropriate for describing the behavioral phenomenon of continuous overeating of a variety of foods and avoiding the conflicting assumptions that certain food can lead to the development of a SUD. Still, the scientific debate about \u201ceating addiction\u201d is in its infancy, and further studies should try to replicate these results by also employing cross-cultural designs and investigating the AEBS discrimination capability with a wider range of populations, including those with BED and other eating disorders.\nAuthor Contributions: A.A.R. conceived the study, collected the data, performed statistical analyses, displayed tables and figures, and wrote part of the first draft.
