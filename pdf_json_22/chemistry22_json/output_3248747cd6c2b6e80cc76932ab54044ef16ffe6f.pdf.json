    "abstractText": "Seaweeds are valuable feedstocks with the potential to be used as ingredients in aquafeeds. However, their use are still limited, given their recalcitrant polysaccharide structure. To break this structure, a biotechnological approach such as solid-state fermentation (SSF) by filamentous fungi can be used, which simultaneously increases the nutritional value of the biomass. However, SSF has hardly been studied in seaweeds; thus, in this study, five different seaweeds (Gracilaria sp., Porphyra dioica, Codium tomentosum, Ulva rigida, and Alaria esculenta) were used as substrates in SSF with Aspergillus ibericus MUM 03.49 and A. niger CECT 2915. Firstly, the seaweeds were fully characterized, and, then, changes in the crude protein and carbohydrate contents were assessed in the fermented biomass, as well as any carbohydrases production. The SSF of U. rigida with both fungi resulted in the maximum xylanase and \u03b2-glucosidase activities. The maximum cellulase activity was achieved using Gracilaria sp. and U. rigida in the SSF with A. niger. The protein content increased in C. tomentosum after SSF with A. ibericus and in U. rigida after SSF with both fungi. Moreover, U. rigida\u2019s carbohydrate content decreased by 54% and 62% after SSF with A. ibericus and A. niger, respectively. Seaweed bioprocessing using SSF is a sustainable and cost-effective strategy that simultaneously produces high-value enzymes and nutritionally enhanced seaweeds to be included in aquafeeds.",

            "text": "Seaweeds, also called macroalgae, are a group of autotrophic plant-like organisms without leaves, roots, and stems [1]. In 2020, 36 million tons (wet weight) of seaweeds were produced, of which 97 percent originated from aquaculture, which was worth USD 16.5 billion [2]. The high biomass yield, fast growth rate, positive carbon balance, and lack of competition for freshwater and arable land with terrestrial plants are significant advantages that support the sustainable and economical use of seaweeds [3]. There are three large groups of seaweeds based on their photosynthetic pigmentation: green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) [4]. Seaweeds contain 80\u201390% water, 50% (dry weight, DW) carbohydrates, 1\u20133% DW lipids, and 7\u201338% DW minerals [5]. The protein content varies greatly among groups, from 10 to 47% DW, constituted by a high amount of essential amino acids [5]. Specifically, the main photosynthetic pigments of green seaweeds are chlorophylls a and b, xanthophyll and carotene [6], and the species\nFoods 2022, 11, 3864. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11233864 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2022, 11, 3864 2 of 16\nfrom the Ulva genus are constituted by ulvan, a sulfated polysaccharide present in their cell walls [7]. Chlorophylls a and d and \u03b2-carotene are pigments present in red seaweeds, whose color is due to the presence of phycoerythrin and phycocyanin [6]. The major cellwall polysaccharides of red seaweeds are galactans, such as carrageenan and agar [8], while in brown seaweeds, they are fucoidan, laminarin, alginate, and mannitol [9,10]. The chlorophylls a and c, fucoxanthin, and \u03b2-carotene are the pigments found in brown seaweeds [6]. Nonetheless, a wide range of other bioactive compounds can also be found in all types of seaweeds, such as phenolic and antioxidant compounds, vitamins (A and B complex), minerals (calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, and others), and polyunsaturated fatty acids [11]. Seaweeds are already used in different applications worldwide, such as for industrial phycocolloids extraction, human and animal nutrition (livestock), or farming (biofertilizers) [12]. Despite the seaweeds\u2019 promising nutritional composition and presence of bioactive substances, their nutritional value is still underexplored, mainly because of their structural polysaccharides, which may be overcome through valorization strategies, such as solid-state fermentation (SSF). SSF is a bioprocess that occurs in a solid substrate in the absence or near-absence of free water. However, the substrate must contain sufficient moisture to allow microbial growth and metabolism [13]. SSF may be applied in a wide range of raw materials, from agro-industrial wastes to seaweeds, for example. In fact, seaweeds may be used as both physical and as nutritional substrates resulting, at the end of SSF, in a nutritionally enhanced biomass and/or a functional extract with bioactive properties. Furthermore, seaweeds may be used in SSF without drying, since their moisture content (around 70\u201390%) is suitable for fungi growth. During the SSF of seaweeds, filamentous fungi may produce cellulase [14], fucoidanase, alginate lyase [15], pectinase [16], and xylanolytic and lignocellulolytic enzymes [17,18], hydrolyzing their structural polysaccharides and releasing oligosaccharides and free sugars [14]. Moreover, SSF may increase seaweed\u2019s protein content [19\u201321]. Therefore, SSF may be successfully applied in seaweeds, improving their digestibility and nutritional value, simultaneously reducing the structural polysaccharide matrix and increasing the protein content. Moreover, fungal biomass and exogenous enzymes also enrich the fermented biomass, as proven by the few works previously reported [17]. The dietary inclusion of seaweeds in fish feeds is still limited, due to their high nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) content, such as cellulose, xylans, and phycocolloids (agar, carrageenan, and alginate), which are anti-nutritional factors that negatively impact the digestion of monogastric animals, including fish [22]. These animals do not have nonstarch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, such as \u03b2-glucanases or \u03b2-xylanases, that digest NSPs [22,23]. Indeed, high dietary NSP levels increase the digesta viscosity, altering its transit velocity rate, gut microbiota, and intestinal morphology, decreasing intestinal nutrient absorption [24]. The dietary inclusion of up to 10% of seaweeds in aquafeeds showed promising results on growth [25,26] and fish immune status [27]. However, incorporation levels above 10% reflected negative effects on fish growth, and feed and protein utilization [28,29]. The utilization of SSF in U. rigida, a green seaweed, within a circular economy approach towards its inclusion in aquafeeds, was recently studied [17]. The dietary inclusion of 5% of fermented U. rigida improved the feed efficiency without affecting the growth of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), while the dietary inclusion of crude seaweed decreased the fish growth and feed efficiency [30]. Thus, the SSF of seaweeds may effectively result in enhanced nutritional value ingredients and/or be used to obtain value-added additives for fish feeds. Therefore, this study aims to characterize the chemical composition of different red, green, and brown seaweeds, including their polysaccharide content, fatty acid profile, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, and to assess their potential as substrates in SSF without any previous treatment or nutrient supplementation during the SSF. Furthermore, the SSF was studied using two filamentous fungi, evaluating the\nFoods 2022, 11, 3864 3 of 16\nNSP-degrading enzyme production, the protein content, and the structural alteration in the polysaccharide matrix of seaweeds at the end of the SSF."

Briefly, the samples were digested with 72% (w/w) H2SO4 (30 \u25e6C for 1 h), and then diluted to 4% (w/w) with distilled water and placed at 121 \u25e6C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were filtered through a Gooch crucible to retain the insoluble phase, reported as the acidinsoluble residue (AIR), and placed in a hot air oven at 105 \u25e6C. The filtrate was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a Jasco830-IR intelligent refractive-index detector and a Varian MetaCarb 87H column. The column was eluted with 0.005 M H2SO4, and the flux was 0.6 mL/min at 60 \u25e6C. An extraction with distilled water using a solid:liquid ratio of 1g:5 mL was performed to estimate the free reducing sugars, soluble protein, and total phenolic content. Briefly, the extraction was performed with constant mechanical agitation for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was filtered using a nylon net, and the liquid fraction was centrifuged (7000 rpm, 10 min, 4 \u25e6C) and stored at \u221220 \u25e6C until the analysis. The soluble protein was determined by the Bradford method [33]. The free-reducing sugars were determined using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method (DNS) [34]. The total phenols content (TPC) was measured by the Folin\u2013Ciocalteau method [Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 2676/90], and TPC units were defined as g of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per kg of dry seaweed. The total organic carbon was measured using a Thermo Finnigan Flash Element Analyzer 1112 series (San Jose, CA, USA), and the minerals were determined in the ashes using Flame Atomic Absorption and Atomic Emission Spectrometry (FFAS/FAES; FAAS/FAES)."

            "text": "The moisture content of the different seaweeds ranged between 8.54 \u00b1 0.36 (% w/w) in the dried Gracilaria sp. and 15.5 \u00b1 0.13 (% w/w) in the dried U. rigida (Table 1). Drying the seaweeds before bioprocessing is an important step before their application in different industries since they are easily prone to deterioration. Indeed, the reduction of water activity retards microbial growth, helping preserve the seaweeds\u2019 nutritional and functional quality and reducing the storage volume [36].\nFoods 2022, 11, 3864 5 of 16\nThe ash content varied among the five seaweeds from 19.2 \u00b1 0.01 (% w/w) in the P. dioica to 45.5 \u00b1 0.05 (% w/w) in the C. tomentosum. All the seaweeds analyzed in this study showed a lower ash content compared to those reported in the literature [37,38], except for the A. esculenta, whose 31.1% (w/w) ash content was higher than that reported by M\u00e6hre et al. [39] (24.56%). The higher ash content observed in the C. tomentosum was probably related to the higher salt content of this seaweed. The crude protein content was assessed by converting the total nitrogen to protein using the conversion factor of 5. The traditional conversion factor of 6.25, which is used as the standard factor for several materials, including seaweeds, assumes that protein is the only source of nitrogen in the analyzed sample and, in fact, any plant material, such as macroalgae, has substantial sources of non-protein nitrogen, as chlorophyll, free amino acids, nucleic acids, and inorganic nitrogen [32], which may lead to an overestimation of the protein content. Therefore, in this work, a conversion factor of 5 was considered [32]. The brown seaweed A. esculenta had the lowest protein content (12.6 \u00b1 0.16% w/w) among all the seaweeds, followed by the green seaweeds C. tomentosum and U. rigida, which had similar amounts of crude protein (14.2 \u00b1 0.04 and 14.6 \u00b1 0.35% w/w, respectively). The red seaweeds had higher protein contents than the other seaweeds, especially the Gracilaria sp. The crude protein varies between seaweed species, and brown macroalgae usually have lower protein contents than green and red macroalgae [40]. Similar values were reported by Fernandes et al. [17] for U. rigida (16.9% w/w), by Machado et al. [41] for P. dioica (23.7%), by Echave et al. [42] for C. tomentosum (15%), by Neto et al. [38] for Gracilaria sp. (23.6%), and by Lytou et al. [43] for A. esculenta (11.3% for seaweeds collected in 2019 and 9.1% for seaweeds collected in 2020). The carbohydrate content of the five seaweeds ranged between 9.59% (w/w) in the Gracilaria sp. and 33.3% (w/w) in the C. tomentosum. This is quite a variable factor, even within the same algae genus. In the literature, values from 4.71% [44] to 53.54% [45] are reported for the Gracilaria species. In general, the carbohydrate content obtained in this study was lower than those reported in other studies [46\u201348]. In this work, the seaweeds were characterized and directly used in the SSF without a previous washing stage. This step could lead to a concentration of other compounds, such as carbohydrates. The lipid fraction ranged between 1.91 and 6.39% w/w (Table 1). The green macroalgae C. tomentosum presented the highest lipid content among the seaweeds. The same result was reported by Rodrigues et al. [49], who observed that C. tomentosum had the highest lipid content (3.6%) among six studied seaweeds. Regarding the lipid content of Gracilaria sp.,\nFoods 2022, 11, 3864 6 of 16\nP. dioica, and A. esculenta, they were higher than those described in other studies, such as 0.7% [38] and 0.3% [50] for Gracilaria sp.; 0.86% [51] and 1.2% [52] for P. dioica; and 1.1% [53] and 0.89% [54] for A. esculenta. In the case of U. rigida, its lipid content was similar to that observed by Fernandes et al. [17] (1.4%) and Kumari et al. [55] (2.0%). Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and the C/N ratio are essential factors for SSF since the C supplies the energy necessary for the microorganisms\u2019 growth and metabolism, while the N stimulates fungal conidiation [56]. In this study, the carbon and nitrogen contents of the seaweeds ranged between 21.7\u201338.1% and 3.03\u20135.27%, respectively, while the C/N ratios varied between 5.86 (Gracilaria sp.) and 12.2 (A. esculenta) (Table 1). Karray et al. [57] carried out SSF with A. niger CTM 10099 in a mixture of U. rigida and wheat bran; they tested \u03b2-glucosidase production under several C/N ratios (from 1 to 80) and observed that the highest enzyme activity was obtained using a C/N of 5, decreasing the enzymes\u2019 activity at higher ratio values. The micro- and macro-mineral composition of the five seaweeds are presented in Table 2. The most abundant macro-elements found were Ca, Mg, K, and Na, supporting the evidence that these seaweeds are an ideal source of these nutritionally important minerals. Regarding the micro-elements, Zn, Mn, Fe, and Cu are some of the most important, but they were not present in all the macroalgae studied. Fe was present in all the seaweeds and was the most abundant among the micro-elements, except in A. esculenta, where Zn had the highest concentration. The green seaweed U. rigida was constituted by the highest amounts of Fe, Mn, and Mg among all the seaweeds, values that are even greater than those reported by Cassani et al. [37]. Although macroalgae are known as good sources of selenium, this element was not detected in the seaweeds we studied, which is probably due to the small quantity present. M\u00e6hre et al. [39] observed that selenium levels ranged from 0.02 to 0.53 mg kg\u22121 DW in different macroalgae, where the red algae Palmaria palmata and Vertebrata lanosa presented the highest amounts.\nDespite seaweeds\u2019 low lipid content, their fatty acid profile contains nutritionally important polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) [55]. The fatty acid composition of the different seaweeds is shown in Table 3. In general, all the seaweeds had a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (54.8%), of which 38.1% were PUFAs and 16.7% were monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). On the other hand, the seaweeds\u2019 saturated fatty acids content was around 45.2%. Palmitic acid represents more than half of the total SFA in all seaweeds, ranging between 1.34 mg g\u22121 in P. dioica and 14.3 mg g\u22121 in C. tomentosum. Indeed, C. tomentosum had the highest total fatty acid content (47.8 \u00b1 3.09 mg g\u22121) among all the seaweeds, including PUFAs such as linoleic (5.93 mg g\u22121), alpha-linolenic (ALA; 5.92 mg g\u22121), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA; 5.66 mg g\u22121). It is also worth noting that DHA was found in all the macroalgae studied. Along with arachidonic acid (ARA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), DHA is an essential fatty acid for fish nutrition, especially in marine species, since it benefits fish physiological and cardiovascular health, inflammatory and immune responses, and neural development [58,59]. Rodrigues et al. [49] also observed that, among six seaweeds studied, C. tomentosum had the highest fatty acid content (27.6 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5g FA/mg dry seaweed), and PUFAs were present in a higher quantity than SFA, as was observed in the present study.\nFoods 2022, 11, 3864 7 of 16"

Previous results demonstrated that A. ibericus MUM 03.49 has a high potential to grow on U. rigida under SSF conditions [17], and A. niger CECT 2915\u2019s suitability to produce carbohydrases on the SSF of winery, olive mill, and brewery wastes [60]. Table 4 shows the xylanase, cellulase, and \u03b2-glucosidase activity obtained from the SSF. The maximum xylanase and \u03b2-glucosidase activities were obtained in the SSF of U. rigida with both fungi. Nevertheless, for the SSF of U. rigida, the higher xylanase activity was achieved with A. niger, increasing 5.3-fold this enzyme production compared to the SSF using A. ibericus. The cellulase activity was higher in the SSF of Gracilaria sp. and U. rigida with A. niger than in the other seaweeds (p < 0.05). The use of seaweeds as a substrate for enzyme production during SSF is still underexplored. Fernandes et al. [17] used U. rigida in SSF with A. ibericus and obtained 359.8 U g\u22121 of xylanase activity, a higher value than that obtained in this study using the same strain. These authors used micronized seaweed, which may have contributed to higher enzyme activity. This may indicate that the reduced particle size of the substrates is an important parameter for enzyme production during SSF. In addition, reducing sugars, salts, and ashes were present in higher amounts in the dried micronized U. rigida, which could help fungal growth and, consequently, enzyme production. Trivedi et al. [14] used the green seaweed Ulva fasciata supplemented with minerals as a substrate for cellulase production during SSF with Cladosporium sphaerospermum, obtaining 10.2 \u00b1 0.40 U g\u22121 of enzyme. In this study, using U. rigida as the substrate, the cellulase activity reached 19.8 \u00b1 1.61 U g\u22121 with A. ibericus and 101 \u00b1 10.27 U g\u22121 with A. niger. Other works demonstrated that other enzymes may also be produced during semi-solid state fermentation (SSF) of seaweeds, such as agarase [61] and pectinase [16]. The mixture of seaweeds with wastes has also been studied for enzyme production by SSF: Karray et al. [57] mixed U. rigida with wheat bran to produce \u03b2-glucosidase, and Mohapatra [62] used Sargassum waste along with cow dung to produce alginate lyase and mannanase. The production of rhamnase in green seaweeds, agarase in red seaweeds, and alginate lyase in brown seaweed were also assessed in this study, but no enzymatic activities were detected.\nFoods 2022, 11, 3864 8 of 16\nResults are presented as the mean (n = 3)\u00b1 SD.

The protein content of C. tomentosum and U. rigida increased after SSF with A. ibericus (C. tomentosum) and both fungi (U rigida; p < 0.05). Fernandes et al. [17] observed an increase of 1.3-fold in the protein content of U. rigida after SSF with A. ibericus. In this study, the U. rigida protein increased 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold with A. ibericus and A. niger, respectively. Other authors used SSF in different seaweeds, also aiming to increase the protein content: LoaizaBonilla et al. [21] performed a hydrothermal pretreatment followed by SSF of Sargassum with Aspergillus oryzae, achieving a higher protein content after 96 h (6.6%) compared to the control (3.7%); the SSF of Sargassum fulvellum mixed with palm kernel cake increased the protein content from 3.75% to 5.23% [19]. In this study, the P. dioica and A. esculenta protein contents did not vary after fermentation. On the other hand, a decrease in the crude protein during the SSF with both fungi was observed for Gracilaria sp. Sousa et al. [56] also observed a protein reduction after SSF of sunflower, rapeseed, and soybean cakes with Rhyzopus oryzae and A. ibericus, concluding that these fungi may use the available N to support their growth, since no N supplementation was carried out.

Typical bands of agar samples were identified in the unfermented Gracilaria sp.

The band at 1624 cm\u2013 1 is linked to the O\u2013H stretching of bonded water [68], and there are also two less intense peaks at 929 cm\u22121 and 867 cm\u22121, which correspond to the C\u2013O vibrations of the 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose bonds and the C\u2013O\u2013SO3 on the C-6 bonds of galactose, respectively [69].\nFigure 3. FTIR-ATR spectra of red seaweeds.\nThe unfermented and fermented C. tomentosum spectra are very similar (Figure 4), indicating that the SSF may not have affected the structural composition of this seaweed. Indeed, the SSF of C. tomentosum resulted in the lowest enzymatic activities among all the seaweeds, which can probably be explained by the lower development of the fungus on this substrate. Both the bands at 1640 and 1540 cm\u20131 are assigned to the carbonyl stretching of amide, while the 1379 and 1245 cm\u20131 bands correspond to the \u2212CH2\u2013, \u2212CH3, and sulfur groups [70]. The peaks observed at 1143, 1078, and 1054 cm\u20131 may be associated with (1\u21924)-b-D-mannans links [49]. As seen for P. dioica, the U. rigida FTIR spectra also exhibited a band between 3000 cm\u20131 and 2800 cm\u22121 for both the unfermented and fermented (with A. ibericus) samples (Figure 4). The SSF of U. rigida with A. niger led to higher xylanase and cellulase activities, which probably resulted in a stronger substrate modification. The band found at 1637 cm\u22121 is associated with the vibration of the asymmetric stretching of the carboxyl groups and the presence of uronic acids [71].

FTIR-ATR spectra of green seaweeds.\nThe spectra of unfermented and fermented A. esculenta are also very similar, indicating that, similarly to what was observed for C. tomentosum, both fungi found it more difficult to grow in these substrates (Figure 5). The peak observed at 1620 cm\u22121 in both unfermented and fermented A. esculenta could be attributed to the stretching vibration of the COO- present in alginate [69], and the band around 1540 cm\u22121 may be associated with the presence of amide II, confirming the presence of proteins in the samples [64]. The peak found around 1414 cm\u22121 in A. esculenta may be associated with the vibration of a C\u2013OH deformation with the contribution of the O\u2013C\u2013O symmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylate group. The broader band observed between 1230 and 1260 cm\u22121 is assigned to the presence of sulphate ester groups (S=O), indicating that A. esculenta has fucoidan and other sulphated polysaccharides in addition to alginate in its composition [69]. The presence of guluronic and mannuronic acids can be evidenced by the presence of bands at 1080 and 787 cm\u22121 and at 1019 cm\u22121 and 808 cm\u22121, respectively. These are alginate characteristic bands, and, since the peak at 808 cm\u22121 disappears in the fermented A. esculenta, it may indicate that both fungi hydrolyzed this polysaccharide.\nFigure 5.

FTIR-ATR spectra of brown seaweed.\nFigure 5. FTIR-ATR spectra of brown seaweed.\nTypical bands of agar samples were identified in the unfermented Gracilaria sp. (Figure 3): the 930 cm\u22121 band is related to the C\u2013O vibration of LA units, the 1250 cm\u22121 band is assigned to the S=O stretching vibration, and the 1370 cm\u22121 band, which is related\nFoods 2022, 11, 3864 11 of 16\nto the ester sulfates [65]. In the fingerprint region (900\u2013750 cm\u22121 band), there is a band of 890 cm\u22121 associated with the C\u2013H present in the anomeric carbon of the \u03b2-galactose (unsulphated \u03b2-D-galactose) bonds (also characteristic of agar samples), and a band of 824 cm\u22121 associated with the presence of sulfated galactose units in the C-2 position, which can also be observed in an agaran-type polysaccharide isolated from the red seaweed Grateloupia filicina [66], and in the lambda carrageenan standard spectra [67]. The intensity of the bands decreased in the spectra from the fermented Gracilaria sp. with both fungi. The band from 3000 cm\u20131 to 2800 cm\u22121 in the FTIR spectra of P. dioica is similar in this seaweed before and after the SSF with A. ibericus, indicating that the SSF with A. niger induced deeper modifications in this seaweed\u2019s structure (Figure 3). The band at 1624 cm\u20131 is linked to the O\u2013H stretching of bonded water [68], and there are also two less intense peaks at 929 cm\u22121 and 867 cm\u22121, which correspond to the C\u2013O vibrations of the 3,6-anhydro-Dgalactose bonds and the C\u2013O\u2013SO3 on the C-6 bonds of galactose, respectively [69]. The unfermented and fermented C. tomentosum spectra are very similar (Figure 4), indicating that the SSF may not have affected the structural composition of this seaweed. Indeed, the SSF of C. tomentosum resulted in the lowest enzymatic activities among all the seaweeds, which can probably be explained by the lower development of the fungus on this substrate. Both the bands at 1640 and 1540 cm\u20131 are assigned to the carbonyl stretching of amide, while the 1379 and 1245 cm\u20131 bands correspond to the \u2212CH2\u2013, \u2212CH3, and sulfur groups [70]. The peaks observed at 1143, 1078, and 1054 cm\u20131 may be associated with (1\u21924)-b-D-mannans links [49].\nAs seen for P. dioica, the U. rigida FTIR spectra also exhibited a band between 3000 cm\u20131\nand 2800 cm\u22121 for both the unfermented and fermented (with A. ibericus) samples (Figure 4). The SSF of U. rigida with A. niger led to higher xylanase and cellulase activities, which probably resulted in a stronger substrate modification. The band found at 1637 cm\u22121 is associated with the vibration of the asymmetric stretching of the carboxyl groups and the presence of uronic acids [71]. The N\u2013H stretching observed at 1544 cm\u22121 is linked to the presence of amino acids, and both bands found between 840 and 790 cm\u22121 are associated with a C=C stretch [72]. The spectra of unfermented and fermented A. esculenta are also very similar, indicating that, similarly to what was observed for C. tomentosum, both fungi found it more difficult to grow in these substrates (Figure 5). The peak observed at 1620 cm\u22121 in both unfermented and fermented A. esculenta could be attributed to the stretching vibration of the COOpresent in alginate [69], and the band around 1540 cm\u22121 may be associated with the presence of amide II, confirming the presence of proteins in the samples [64].

The A. ibericus and A. niger successfully produced enzymes that modified the seaweeds\u2019 structure, resulting in a protein increment, especially in the green seaweed U. rigida. Therefore, SSF is an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and sustainable biovalorization approach that may result in nutritionally suitable seaweeds for aquafeeds.
