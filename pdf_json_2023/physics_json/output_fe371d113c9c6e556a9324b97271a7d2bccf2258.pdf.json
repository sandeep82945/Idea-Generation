Owing to its high energy density and environmentally friendly characteristics, molecular hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier to meet future global energy demands.1\u20134 Electrochemical water splitting that converts water into hydrogen and oxygen is a promising way for sustainable production of hydrogen, especially when it is driven by green electricity from sunlight, wind, hydropower, etc. Alkaline water electrolysis is one of the most mature and widely used electrolysis technologies for hydrogen\nysis Science and Technology, School of njin University, Tianjin 300072, China.\nonics Project and International Center for\nNational Institute for Materials Science\n044, Japan tralian Institute for Bioengineering and\neensland, Brisbane, QLD 4072, Australia\n414\nproduction due to its low-cost components and high durability. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media lead to high overpotentials for practical water splitting. To promote the HER kinetics, efficient electrocatalysts are necessary to decrease the reaction overpotentials, thus making the water splitting more energysaving. As a benchmark HER electrocatalyst, precious metal platinum (Pt)-based materials are almost still the catalysts with the highest intrinsic activity.5 Unfortunately, the scarcity and high cost of Pt seriously impede its large-scale applications in the electrocatalytic HER.\nTo develop efficient and earth-abundant alternatives to Pt as HER electrocatalysts, great efforts have been made to explore transition metal-based electrocatalysts over the past decade, including metal oxides,6\u20138 metal alloys,9\u201312 traditional metal phosphides,13\u201317 carbides,18,19 and suldes.20\u201322 Among them, nickel-based materials are the most used electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyzers, and especially, nickel\u2013molybdenum (Ni\u2013 Mo) bimetallic catalysts exhibit the best HER catalytic performance among all the non-noble metal-based materials.23\u201342 Typically, Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles supported by MoO2 cuboids on nickel foam exhibited zero onset overpotential, an\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

However, the detailed mechanism for the enhanced activity of Ni\u2013Mo catalysts remains controversial, and several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the high HER activity of Ni\u2013Mo-based electrocatalysts. One prevailing explanation is related to the electronic synergy of Ni and Mo in the alloy, leading to an appropriate hydrogen adsorption energy of the catalyst surface.43,44 The second proposed mechanism is that Ni activates water dissociation to produce adsorbed hydrogen species which then transfer to the Mo surface via hydrogen spillover to produce molecular hydrogen, called the hydrogenspillover effect.45 And the third explanation is that the intrinsic activity of the Ni\u2013Mo alloy originates from Ni and surface area enhancement through Mo dissolution improves the current density.46 These three mechanisms focus on the role of metallic Ni as the primary active site. However, the recent results demonstrated that aMo oxo species (most likely Mo3+) supported on metallic Ni or the NixMoy alloy was responsible for the high activity of a Ni\u2013Mo catalyst for water reduction to form hydrogen.47 It can be clearly seen that these mechanisms are inconsistent, indicating the complexity of the Ni\u2013Mo catalytic system. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the factors that affect the activity of the Ni\u2013Mo catalyst and deeply understand the nature of high activity.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the HER kinetics in alkaline solutions involves two steps: water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen (Volmer step) and combination of adsorbed hydrogen into molecular hydrogen (Heyrovsky or Tafel step).48,49 Compared to the HER under acidic conditions, where protons are directly used as reactants, the reactants in an alkaline solution switch from protons to water as the hydrogen source, and an additional water dissociation step needs to occur to release protons, which\nFig. 1 (A) The reaction mechanism for the HER in alkaline electrolytes and two pathways are presented in the forms of the Volmer\u2013Heyrovsky mechanism and the Volmer\u2013Tafel mechanism.

As a result, even for Pt-based catalysts, the catalytic performance and kinetics are hindered by the slow rate of water cleavage in the Volmer step. Due to this reason, the reaction rate on Pt is usually 2\u20133 orders lower in an alkali than that in an acid.50 Therefore, efficient HER under alkaline conditions requires that the active sites of the catalyst simultaneously accelerate the water dissociation and hydrogen combination reactions. Interestingly, the decoration of Ni(OH)2 on the Pt surfaces has been demonstrated to drastically increase the HER performance of Pt catalysts under alkaline conditions, and it is proposed that Ni(OH)2 promotes the cleavage of H\u2013OH bonds in the water dissociation step, while Pt facilitates adsorption and combination of the generated hydrogen intermediates to form H2 molecules.5 Pt/Ni(OH)2based systems have not only advanced electrocatalytic performances but also provided insight into reaction mechanisms.\nInspired by the fundamental HER mechanism that occurs on Pt/Ni(OH)2 interface, we systematically summarize the structural characteristics of Ni\u2013Mo-based electrocatalysts recently reported, and nd surprisingly that highly active catalysts generally have alloy\u2013oxide or alloy\u2013hydroxide interface structures. It is not difficult to speculate that the two components at the interface may jointly promote the two-step reaction of the HER in Ni\u2013Mo systems. Based on this understanding, we discuss in detail the relationship between the two types of interface structures obtained by different synthesis methods and their HER performance in Ni\u2013Mo-based catalysts. For the alloy\u2013oxide interfaces, the Ni4Mo/MoOx (mixed oxide with the Mo ion valence from +4 to +6) composites produced by electrodeposition or hydrothermal combined with thermal reduction exhibit activities close to that of platinum. For only the alloy or oxide, their activities are signicantly lower than that of composite structures, indicating the synergistic catalytic effect of binary components. For the alloy\u2013 hydroxide interfaces, the activity of the NixMoy alloy with different Ni/Mo ratios is greatly improved by constructing heterostructures with hydroxides such as Ni(OH)2 or Co(OH)2. In particular, pure alloys obtained bymetallurgymust be activated to produce a layer of mixed Ni(OH)2 and MoOx on the surface to achieve high activity. Therefore, it can be seen that the activity of Ni\u2013Mo catalysts probably originates from the interfaces of alloy\u2013oxide or alloy\u2013hydroxide, in which the oxide or hydroxide promotes water dissociation and the alloy accelerates hydrogen combination.

Since Mo6+ is more difficult to reduce than Ni2+, only part of Mo ions is reduced to form alloys during the reduction of metal salts or oxide intermediates, and excessive Mo ions will form oxides, resulting in a large number of alloy/oxide interface structures. Therefore, the proportion of Ni/Mo and the reduction conditions determine the composition of the products, mainly including the type of Ni\u2013Mo alloy, the content, and valence of MoOx. Under general chemical reduction conditions, such as electrochemical reduction or hydrogen reduction below 600 \u00b0C, the Ni\u2013Moalloy is mainly Ni4Mo, and MoOx is a mixed oxide with the Mo ion valence from +4 to +6. In the following, we will introduce several Ni\u2013Mo-based catalysts prepared by a chemical method, focusing on the interface structures of N4Mo/MoOx and their HER performances.\nThe Ni4Mo nanodot/amorphous MoOx nanosheet interface structure was synthesized on copper foam via a one-step electrodeposition process as shown in Fig. 2A.51 In the electrodeposition process, the MoO4 2\u2212 anions, Ni2+ cations, and the citrate\n3402 | Chem.

By changing the ratio of Ni/Mo and electroreduction current density, the samples of Ni4Mo and pure Ni were also synthesized for the comparison experiment. The as-synthesized composite catalyst exhibits ultrathin nanosheet morphology (Fig. 2B) and many nanoparticles with a diameter of about 5 nm are homogeneously distributed on the nanosheets (Fig. 2C). The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2D) and selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2E) show lattice fringes of (121) and (310) planes of the Ni4Mo nanoparticle, while no crystal lattice of MoOx nanosheets could be observed, suggesting the amorphous nature of the MoOx nanosheets. The strong Raman peaks in the range of 550\u20131000 cm\u22121 also verify the presence of amorphous molybdenum oxide, and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Ar etching shows that all Ni2+ is reduced to Ni0, while theMo element exists not only in the form of Mo0 but also oxidized forms including Mo4+ and Mo5+.

Evidently, the HER activity of Ni increases substantially by forming an alloy with Mo and is further boosted by constructing the Ni4Mo/MoOx nanointerfaces, indicating the benecial bimetallic ligand effect and synergetic effect between the metal and metal oxide. The theoretical study shows that the Ni4Mo/MoOx has a strong bonding at the interface and the electronic distribution indicates that the Ni4Mo alloy is more electron-rich (Fig. 2G), compared with the hole-rich MoOx. The comparison of projected density of states (PDOS) indicates that the d-band center of Ni at the interface downshis toward lower energy levels, which optimizes the bonding strength of *H on the alloy. In MoOx, the deep localized O-2p band overlaps with the Mo-4d-t2g state propelling more electrons towards the Mo-4d-eg level, which leads Mo sites to high binding activities for the Orelated species such as *OH intermediates. Therefore, Ni4Mo/ MoOx interface provides a high active area for bond-cleavage of water-splitting under alkaline conditions. The free energy prole for the HER pathway under alkaline conditions is also studied (Fig. 2H), and the Ni4Mo/MoOx interface shows substantial energetic favorable with reaction energy (\u22121.35 eV) gained for the HER.\nIn addition to one-step direct reduction, the two-step method is also widely used in the synthesis of the Ni4Mo/MoOx interface.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nTypically, NiMoO4 nanorod arrays were rst grown on Ni foam via a solvothermal process using Ni foam itself as a Ni source and ammonium molybdate as a Mo source, and then NiMoO4 was partially decomposed to MoNi4 nanocrystals and amorphous MoO3\u2212x by annealing in a H2/Ar atmosphere at 350 \u00b0C (Fig. 3A).52 The HRTEM image (Fig. 3B) displays clear lattice fringes with distances of 1.81 and 2.07 \\ corresponding to the (310) and (121) planes of the MoNi4 alloy, suggesting the production of MoNi4 nanocrystals. Due to the amorphous phase of MoO3\u2212x, no continuous lattice fringes are observed in the HRTEM image, but Raman and XPS spectra clearly evidence the existence ofMoO3\u2212x. As shown in Fig. 3C, the annealed MoNi4/MoO3\u2212x exhibits three new peaks at 121, 480, and 719 cm\u22121 compared to the NiMoO4 precursor, and the three peaks could be ascribed to the lattice deformationmode, deformation of Mo]O stretchingmode, and modication of the Mo2\u2013O bond for MoO3\u2212x species, respectively. The high-resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 3D) of MoNi4/ MoO3\u2212x further demonstrate the existence of Mo\n0, Mo4+, Mo5+, and Mo6+, and the low-valence states of Mo (Mo5+ and Mo4+) imply the formation of MoO3\u2212x with oxygen vacancies.

The HRTEM images of the samples show lattice fringes with lattice distances of 0.35 and 0.28 nm, which correspond to the (110) facet of MoO2 and the (200) facet of MoNi4, respectively (Fig. 4D\u2013F). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis indicates that the surface nanoparticles are constituted by only Mo and Ni with an atomic ratio of 1 : 3.84 (Fig. 4G), which well approaches 1 : 4. The polarization curves (Fig. 4H) show a zero onset potential and the overpotentials at current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm\u22122 for the Ni4Mo/MoO2 electrocatalyst were as low as 15 and 44 mV, respectively, which are signicantly lower than the values for the\nFig. 5 SEM images of the (A) as-prepared Ni4Mo nanorod arrays and (B) N of the Ni4Mo alloy and Pt/C.

For the Pt/C electrocatalyst, it exhibits an overpotential of only 10 mV at a current density of 10 mV cm\u22122, but the maximum current density only reaches 80 mA cm\u22122 due to the Pt catalyst signicantly peeling off from the support. In contrast, the threedimensional (3D) cuboid array grown in situ on Ni foam enables the current density of Ni4Mo/MoO2 to reach 600 mA cm\u22122. Therefore, in addition to intrinsic activity, the 3D structure of the catalyst is also critical to the activity. Based on the electrochemical double-layer capacitances, the TOF of MoNi4/MoO2 is calculated to be 0.4 s\u22121 at the overpotential of 50 mV, which is higher than the TOF values of the previously reported Pt-free electrocatalysts. In addition, it can be seen from the polarization curve that MoO2 cuboids have a certain HER activity, which is much higher than that of Ni nanosheets. Interestingly, the HER activity of MoO2 loaded on carbon paper in acidic and alkaline media is very close (Fig. 4I), which indicates that the additional water dissociation in alkaline media does not reduce the reaction rate, and the overall low activity indicates that the binding capacity of H on MoO2 surface is poor.

View Article Online active Ni4Mo/MoO2 interface has also been demonstrated on other substrates such as stainless-steel wires obtained from worn-out tires (the overpotentials at the current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm\u22122 were only 63 and 77 mV, respectively).57 The Ni4Mo/MoOx active interface can be generated not only by controlling the synthesis conditions but also in the electrochemical activation process. Typically, it is demonstrated that some Mo in Ni4Mo is oxidized during the activation process and dissolved in the form of MoO4 2\u2212.58 Then, the dissolved MoO4 2\u2212\nwill re-adsorb on the alloy surface and polymerize into the dimer Mo2O7 2\u2212 to form a highly active Ni4Mo (or Ni)/Mo2O7 2\u2212 interface. Fig. 5A and B show the SEM images of the as-prepared Ni4Mo nanorod arrays before and aer the HER test. Aer the electrochemical activation, the nanorod array structure is nearly unchanged, except for the roughened surface and increased porosity. As shown in the polarization curves of Fig. 5C, the activated Ni4Mo displays an extremely low overpotential of only 86 mV at 100 mA cm\u22122, which is much better than that of commercial 20% Pt/C with the same mass loading. By analyzing the content of Mo and Ni in the electrolyte, it is found that the content of Ni keeps at a low level throughout the activation process while the content of Mo increases with time and reaches the summit aer 4 h (Fig. 5D). The Mo 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 5E) show that the peaks ofMo0 obviously decrease aer the HER test, while the peaks of Mo4+, Mo5+, and Mo6+ notably increase, indicating the oxidation of Mo. Similarly, in the Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 5F), the ratio of Ni2+ also increases. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is further employed to investigate the change of valence state of Mo and Ni. In the Mo K-edge spectra (Fig. 5G), the post-HER absorption edge is obviously larger than that of the initial one, conrming the oxidation of Mo, while for the Ni K-edge spectra (Fig. 5H), both the initial and the post-HER samples show a similar absorption edge to Ni foil, indicating that Ni is mainly zero valent in the reaction process. In situ Raman spectra are then used to explore the change of Mo species during HER activation (Fig. 5I). Initially, there is no Raman signal, and aer applying a voltage of 0.23 V, a peak centered at 894 cm\u22121 rst appears, which can be assigned to Mo]O symmetric stretching vibration in the MoO4 tetrahedron, indicating the production of MoO4\n2\u2212 ions. Interestingly, with the potential decreasing, another two peaks at 265 and 476 cm\u22121 arise and become strong, both of which correspond to the deformation mode and symmetric stretching mode of Mo\u2013O\u2013 Mo, respectively. The appearance of these two new peaks indicates the possible polymerization of MoO4\n2\u2212 into the dimer of Mo2O7\n2\u2212. The DFT calculations further demonstrate that the Ni (Ni4Mo)/Mo2O7\n2\u2212 interface optimizes the bonding energy with the adsorbed hydrogen (Fig. 5J).\n3. NixMoy alloy/hydroxide interfaces\nExcept oxides, metal hydroxides such as Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 are another kind of active component to promote the dissociation of water for the HER. For example, the Ni(OH)2 modied Mo0.84Ni0.16 alloy exhibited signicantly enhanced activity for the HER compared to the unmodied alloy.59 The synthesis process ofMo0.84Ni0.16@Ni(OH)2 hybrids is illustrated in Fig. 6A. First the\n3406 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3400\u20133414\nNiMoO4 nanowire precursors were grown on Ni foam by a facile hydrothermal process and then were calcined in a H2/Ar atmosphere to obtain the NiMoO4\u2013Mo0.84Ni0.16 composites. Subsequently, the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were modied on the surface of the composites by electrodeposition. As a result, the Mo0.84Ni0.16 alloy and Ni(OH)2 nanosheets formed a heterostructure (Mo0.84Ni0.16@Ni(OH)2). The HRTEM image of the interface (Fig. 6B) demonstrates the lattice distance of 0.27, 0.23, 0.20, and 0.34 nm, which corresponds to the (100), (101), (240), and (040) planes of Ni(OH)2, respectively, and the crystalline lattice distance of 0.24 nm and 0.28 nm corresponds to the (111) plane of Mo0.84Ni0.16 and (\u2212111) plane of NiMoO4, respectively. In the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 6C), the intensity of the OH\u2212 peak becomes strong in Mo0.84Ni0.16@Ni(OH)2 compared to NiMoO4\u2013 Mo0.84Ni0.16 and both O 1s peaks also exhibit a positive shi, suggesting the strong electronic interaction between Mo0.84Ni0.16 and Ni(OH)2. As expected, due to the abundant interface structure and synergistic effect between Mo0.84Ni0.16 and Ni(OH)2, the Mo0.84Ni0.16@Ni(OH)2 heterostructure exhibited high HER activity with a very small overpotential at 10 mA cm\u22122 (10 mV), low Tafel slope (71 mV dec\u22121), and excellent stability (100 h) (Fig. 6D\u2013F), which is much better than that of unmodied NiMoO4\u2013Mo0.84Ni0.16. Aer the 100 h stability test, the SEM image of Mo0.84Ni0.16@Ni(OH)2 (the inset of Fig. 6F) displays the consistent surface morphology with the original Mo0.84Ni0.16@Ni(OH)2. Another more complex heterostructure is composed of Ni4Mo, Ni3N, Ni, and Ni(OH)2 (Fig. 6G and H), which was synthesized by low-temperature H2/N2 plasma activation of Modoped Ni(OH)2 nanosheets arrays (P\u2013Mo\u2013Ni(OH)2 NSAs).60 Due to the synergistic effect of different components, especially the interaction between Ni4Mo and Ni(OH)2, the optimized heterostructure only needs a low overpotential of 22 and 98 mV to deliver a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm\u22122 (Fig. 6I), respectively. At an overpotential of 50 mV, the TOF value of P\u2013 Mo\u2013Ni(OH)2 is 1.325 s\n\u22121, which is much larger than that of Ni (OH)2 (0.42 s\n\u22121). Aer the 100 h stability test at an overpotential of 22 mV, the HRTEM image, XRD pattern, and XPS spectra imply that metallic Ni, Ni4Mo alloy, Ni3N, and Mo incorporated Ni(OH)2 still exist. Moreover, it is found that the Mo concentration in the electrolyte rst increases from 0 to 1.13 ppm and then remains relatively stable, and except for the dissolution of a certain amount ofMo and N and the oxidation of some amount of metallic Ni, the chemical composition and valence states of the P\u2013Mo\u2013Ni(OH)2 change little during the HER. Theoretical and experimental studies show that the metallic Ni4Mo optimizes the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption and Ni(OH)2 can weaken the HO\u2013H bond of absorbed water to facilitate water dissociation in the hetero-interface of Ni4Mo/Ni(OH)2.\nNi(OH)2 on the NiMo alloy surface can not only be modied additionally but also be produced in situ by introducing Fe ions. It has been demonstrated that the presence of Fe on the surface of the Ni4Mo alloy can induce the conversion of the Ni to Ni(OH)2 by forming the Fe\u2013(OH)4\u2013Ni4 motif.50 This catalyst is composed of hydroxide-mediated Ni4Mo nanoparticles decorated with FeOx and anchored onto MoO2 nanosheets (hNiMoFe).

The TEM image (Fig. 7A) shows that the catalyst is composed of ultrathin nanosheets with nanoparticles anchored onto them and the HRTEM images (Fig. 7B and C) show typical lattice spacings of 0.24 nm and 0.20 nm, corresponding to the (020) plane of MoO2 and the (220) plane of Ni4Mo, respectively, and no Fe-based compounds are detected. The polarization curves in Fig. 7D show that the activity of h-NiMoFe is much better than that of NiMo and Ni samples, indicating that alloying of Ni4Mo and addition of Fe play vital roles in the good performance of the h-NiMoFe catalyst. The overpotential of h-NiMoFe at 10 mA cm\u22122 is only 14 mV and even at an increased current density of 1000 mA cm\u22122, the overpotential is still very low (98 mV). Aer 40 h continuous operation, h-NiMoFe shows good stability and maintains its crystalline structure well. In the Ni 3s XPS spectra, it is found that there is a higher content of surface hydroxide on h-NiMoFe than those on the control NiMo and Ni samples due to the introduction of Fe (Fig. 7E). In situ XAS characterization results\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations conrm the local structure of one Fe connecting to four hydroxylated Ni sites on the Ni4Mo surface (denoted as Fe\u2013(OH)4\u2013Ni4, Fig. 7F and G). The added iron in h-NiMoFe extracts electrons from Ni atoms to lead to more unoccupied states of Ni sites, which remarkably changes the charge distribution of Ni sites. The comparison of PDOS shows that the d-band centers of Ni in hNiMoFe exhibit more negative energy than the NiMo catalyst, indicating a stronger H bonding behavior. The energy diagrams of Gibbs free energies further show nearly 0 eV adsorption free energy of H (DGH) and a much lower energy barrier and fast kinetics for water dissociation for h-NiMoFe compared to Pt (Fig. 7H and I). In addition to Ni(OH)2, this system also contains MoO2, which can also promote water dissociation as discussed above, so this system may be a catalytic system with synergistic effects of two interfaces: Ni4Mo/Ni(OH)2 and Ni4Mo/MoO2.\nChem.

View Article Online\nSimilar to Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2 is also used to modify the NiMo alloy to improve the HER performance. The Co(OH)2 cavity arrayencapsulated NiMo alloy on carbon cloth (Co(OH)2/NiMo CA@CC) was prepared by a two-step electrodeposition route.61 As shown in Fig. 8A, the NiMo alloy was rst deposited on carbon cloth by chronopotentiometry (dened as NiMo@CC). And then, with the assistance of a layer of polystyrene (PS) template, Co(OH)2 was conned to nucleate and grow around the PS microspheres by the second electrodeposition. Aer dissolving the PS template, the uniform and ordered Co(OH)2 cavity array was obtained on the surface of NiMo@CC (dened as Co(OH)2/ NiMo CA@CC). The NiMo alloy is composed of uniform nanoparticles with an average size of\u223c70 nm and these nanoparticles are connected to the Co(OH)2 thin nanosheets. The HRTEM image at the boundary shows lattice fringes with a distance of 0.21 and 0.25 nm (Fig. 8B), corresponding to the (111) plane of Ni metal and the (100) plane of a-Co(OH)2, respectively, suggesting that metallic Ni as the dominant phase exists in the NixMoy alloy and forms a heterojunction interface with Co(OH)2. From the\n3408 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3400\u20133414\nXPS spectra (Fig. 8C\u2013E), it is found that both the Ni 2p peaks and Mo 3d peaks in Co(OH)2/NiMo CA@CC are shied by 0.4 and 0.5 eV toward the lower binding energy relative to those of NiMo@CC, respectively, while the characteristic peaks of Co 2p are shied toward high binding energy by 0.8 eV (Fig. 8E), indicating the transfer of electrons from Co of Co(OH)2 to the surface of the NiMo alloy. The HER polarization curves (Fig. 8F) show that Co(OH)2/NiMo CA@CC exhibits the highest catalytic activity among NiMo@CC, Co(OH)2@CC, and NiMo/ Co(OH)2@CC with an overpotential of 30 mV to reach 10 mA cm\u22122. The comparative experiments demonstrate that the coupling of NiMo with Co(OH)2 and the cavity array structure can effectively boost the HER activity. The Gibbs free energy diagram (Fig. 8G) shows that water is more easily adsorbed on Co(OH)2 than on NiMo alloy, and the energy barrier to break the H\u2013OH bond is only 0.58 eV on Co(OH)2, which is much lower than that of the NiMo alloy (up to 1.04 eV), indicating that the introduction of Co(OH)2 substantially accelerates the kinetics of the water adsorption and dissociation steps.

For the NixMoy alloys obtained by high-temperature metallurgy, their HER activities are generally not high due to the lack of an interface structure, but their activities will be greatly improved aer electrochemical activation to produce a layer of Ni(OH)2 or MoOx on the surface. A typical example is the nanosponge-like Ni0.33Mo0.67 solid solution catalyst synthesized via a one-step high-temperature (900 \u00b0C) sintering method by using metallic Ni, Mo, and magnesium (Mg) powders (Fig. 9A).62 Spherical Mg powder was added as a poremaking agent to prepare nanoporous alloys.

For Ni 2p (Fig. 9D), aer aging, the peaks of Ni0 and Ni3+ at 852.4 eV and 855.8 eV disappear and the peak of Ni2+ at 855.6 eV is produced, corresponding to a phase of Ni(OH)2. For Mo 3d (Fig. 9E), the relative amount of Mo0, Mo4+, and Mo5+ species in the activated sample rapidly decreases relative to the pristine sample; in contrast, Mo6+ increases, indicating the formation of high valence MoOx. For O 1s (Fig. 9F), the peak intensity of hydroxyl groups has an obvious increase.

As another example, the plasma sprayed RANEY\u00ae-type NiMo electrode also forms a layer of Ni(OH)2 and MoOx aer chemical activation.63 Due to proper micropore/macropore distribution, appropriate amounts of active nickel and molybdenum species, and the oxidation degree, the activated NiMo electrode delivered a high current density of 200 mA cm\u22122 at 82 mV and stabilized with no measurable degradation over 47 days for the HER in 30 wt% KOH.\nFrom the above example analysis, it can be seen that the NixMoy alloy/hydroxide interface exhibits a bi-functional effect to simultaneously promote the dissociation of water and the\n3410 | Chem.

The kinetics of the HER in alkaline solutions will depend both on the rate of desorption of OHad to accommodate the adsorption of H2O on hydroxide and on the rate of Had recombination, which is optimized on the alloy. For the dissociation of water, the activity will be controlled by the bond strength between metal hydroxides M(OH)x and OHad. In order to explore their interaction, a descriptor, OH\u2013M2+d bond strength (0 # d # 1.5), was proposed, and it was found that the activity trend was Mn < Fe < Co < Ni, which was inversely proportional to the OH\u2013M2+d strength of Ni < Co < Fe < Mn.64 For the Fe andMn hydroxides, due to their strong bonding withOHad, OHad cannot be desorbed and the reaction cannot continue, resulting in \u2018poisoning\u2019 of the surface. In contrast, for Ni hydroxides that bindOHad neither too strongly nor tooweakly, the maximum activity was realized for the HER. Thus, the overall rate of the HER may, in principle, be controlled by optimizing the density and the nature of the sites required for dissociation of water onM(OH)x, as well as the OH\u2013M 2+d and alloy-Had energetics.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "In this perspective, we systematically summarize the characteristics of structures and components obtained by different synthesis methods in Ni\u2013Mo-based catalysts, and discuss their corresponding relationship with HER performance in detail. It can be found that most of the currently reported highly active Ni\u2013Mo-based catalysts have alloy\u2013oxide or alloy\u2013hydroxide interface structures, as summarized in Tables 1 and 2. According to the logic of synthesis\u2013structure\u2013performance, we discuss the inuence of the composition changes of two types of interface structures on HER activity. For the alloy\u2013oxide interfaces, the Ni4Mo/MoOx (mixed oxide with the Mo ion valence from +4 to +6) composites produced by electrodeposition or hydrothermal combined with thermal reduction exhibit activities close to that of platinum. For only the alloy or oxide, their activities are signicantly lower than that of composite structures, indicating the synergistic catalytic effect of binary components. Interestingly, the HER activity of MoO2 in acidic and alkaline media is very close, indicating that MoO2 can eliminate the inuence of additional water dissociation under alkaline conditions. For the alloy\u2013hydroxide interfaces, the activity of the NixMoy alloy with different Ni/Mo ratios is greatly improved by constructing heterostructures with hydroxides such as Ni(OH)2 or Co(OH)2. In particular, pure alloys obtained by metallurgy must be activated to produce a layer of mixed Ni(OH)2 and MoOx on the surface to achieve high activity. Theoretical and experimental studies show that metallic NixMoy alloys optimize the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption and MoOx or Ni(OH)2 can weaken the HO\u2013H bond of absorbed water to facilitate water dissociation in the hetero-interfaces. Therefore, it can be seen that the activity of Ni\u2013Mo catalysts probably originates from the interfaces of alloy\u2013oxide or alloy\u2013 hydroxide.\nAlthough NiMo-based catalysts exhibit outstanding HER activity, the dissolvable nature of Mo in alkaline solution results in the poor stability of the NixMoy alloy due to the lower oxidation potential of Mo than that of H2. Therefore, controlling the dissolution of Mo species is crucial to improve the stability of NiMo-based catalysts. At present, there are three strategies that have proved effective and can be tried to develop: (1) preparation of the pure phase NiMo alloy with high specic surface area by a metallurgical method; the most stable catalysts reported are almost all treated by high-temperature alloying. Compared with nanoalloys prepared by a low-temperature chemical method, high-temperature alloying is benecial to improve the compactness and continuity of the catalyst. Aer electrochemical activation, a layer of Ni(OH)2 or MoOx on the surface is formed, which can not only facilitate the dissociation of water but also provide a protective layer to prevent the dissolution of the Mo element. (2) The formed interface structure is coated with carbon or other conductive oxides or hydroxides; by adsorbing or depositing a layer of carbon precursor molecules on the surface and then carbonizing, an alloy/oxide or alloy/hydroxide interface structure uniformly coated with carbon layer can be obtained.

(3) Establishment of dynamic dissolution and re-adsorption equilibrium of Mo ions in electrolytes; the literature results reveal that MoO4 2\u2212 can be easily dissolved in KOH electrolyte and readsorbed on the surface of the catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which delivers a promoting effect on OER performance.65 Theoretical calculations show that the adsorption of the dimer Mo2O7\n2\u2212 can promote the HER activity of metallic Ni.58 Therefore, the dissolution of Mo will be effectively inhibited and the stability of NiMo-based catalysts will be greatly improved through reasonable control of the above three aspects."
