The magnetic-field dependence of resistivity and the Hall conductivity exhibits a plateau and a sharp jump associated with a magnetic-field hysteresis, similar to a liquid-gas-like transition in dipolar spin ice system. Furthermore, the Kondo coupling is controlled by the hydrostatic pressure, revealing that the field-induced displacement of Weyl points in the momentum space strongly depends on the respective electronic state as well as on the Kondo coupling strength. These observations pave a route toward the engineering of band topology in hybrid quantum materials with relativistic conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments.\nGeometrical frustration, which gives rise to unusual magnetic ground states and excitations, is a longstanding issue in condensed matter physics. A wellstudied example is pyrochlore magnets, composed of a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra (Fig. 1(a)) [1]. For instance, pyrochlore rare-earth (R) titanates turn into the disordered spin ice (SI) state under the constraint that two of four spins on the vertices of the tetrahedron point inward to its center and the other two outward (2-in 2-out (2/2) configuration). This local constraint named \u2018ice rule\u2019 after analogous proton bond disorder in water ice produces interesting properties such as the Pauling\u2019s residual entropy [2, 3] and fractional excitations [4, 5]. One advantage of a magnetic system in frustration physics is to manipulate the zero-point entropy by an external magnetic field. In particular, the application of the field along the [111] crystalline direction, which is parallel to the anisotropic axis of the apical spin on the (111) triangular layer (Fig. 1(a)), firstly polarizes the apical spin to confine the 2/2 disorder into the two-dimensional kagome\u0301 planes, i.e. kagome\u0301 ice (KI), followed by the fully-polarized 3-in 1-out (3/1) state in a sufficiently large field [6\u20138].\nRecent intensive studies on topological electronic states have spurred renewed interest in frustrated systems [9\u201312]. Among them, particular attention has been focused on the family of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R being rare-earth ions or Y) as promising magnetic topological materials; R2Ir2O7 is the first system proposed to be an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal (WSM) with an all-in all-out order of the Ir moments [13], and furthermore the interplay between localized R-4f moments and Ir conduction electrons is expected to produce a variety of WSM states [14, 15]. Among the R2Ir2O7 family, Pr2Ir2O7 and Nd2Ir2O7 are located near the metal-\ninsulator boundary. In paramagnetic phase, their electronic structures are characterized by the quadratic band touching (QBT) at the \u0393 (k=0) point that is protected by cubic symmetry [16, 17]. Importantly, the symmetry breaking is expected to yield topologically-nontrivial electronic states; in fact, Pr2Ir2O7 and Nd2Ir2O7 have been found to exhibit a variety of interesting properties including unusual anomalous Hall effect [18, 19], magnetic field-induced metal-insulator transitions [20\u2013 22], and anomalous metallic states on magnetic domain walls [23, 24]. These observations imply that near the metal-insulator boundary the magnetic field stabilizes a variety of rare-earth magnetic configurations, and more importantly, broadens the region of the topological electronic phases with Weyl nodes. However, the magnetic ground state of Pr2Ir2O7 remains controversial, in part due to the difficulty in keeping the right material stoichiometry inherent to volatile starting materials [25].\nIn this work, we carefully prepared and characterized single-crystalline Pr2Ir2O7 (see Ref. [26]) and performed thorough investigations by means of magnetization and specific-heat measurement, as well as the electrical transport down to 0.05 K and under hydrostatic pressure for the close examination of the ground state. The precise single-crystal structure analysis reveals the anti-site mixing for several samples. For the close-stoichiometric sample, we find that Pr 4f moments undergo a long-range magnetic order with SI manifold at zero field and a cascade of field-induced metamagnetic transitions to KI and 3/1 states, akin to the dipolar spin-ice system. Both longitudinal and Hall resistivities show significant changes across the transitions, indicative of the topological Ir 5d electron band modulation via the f -d Kondo coupling in the respective WSM states. To possibly control the f -d Kondo coupling, we exploit the application of high\n2 !\"\"\"# !\"#$\"$#%&'()%(*$ +,-!./ (*$ 01()%21!34 5,6\n576\n5865*6\n5#6\n5$6\n5-6\n!\"#$\"% !\"#$%&'()*+%&()$,)-+./('01+'0$/)-(+#&2(3)\"4) 56()$7'0$/)0#)#$-(89+')30:(2(/'),2$-)'9() 72(*0$&#)#'&34 ;<)=((3)'$)>9(>?)\n;@ABBC <)$23(2(3)EFE\n\"#$%#$&'()'*+,-./ 01$'-#2$345$!\"267889:$;:6<7=G2:> H2\n6 4 2 0R es is ti v it y ( m \u2126\ncm )\n3002001000\nTemperature (K)\nPr2Ir2O7 0 GPa 1.0 1.5\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\nM ag\nn et\niz at\nio n\n( \u00b5\nB /f\n.u .)\nPr2Ir2O7 H//[111] 0.01 T\n1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 R es is ti v it y ( m \u2126 cm )\nPr2Ir2O7 H//[111] 0.05 K\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\nM ag\nn et\niz at\nio n\n( \u00b5\nB /f\n.u .)\n543210\nMagnetic Field (T)\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\nd M /d H (\u00b5 B /f.u ./T )\nPr2Ir2O7 H//[111] 0.39 K\n12\n8\n4\n0\nH al\nl re\nsi st\niv it\ny (\n\u00b5 \u2126\ncm )\nPr2Ir2O7 H//[111] 0.05 K\nFIG. 1.

Schematic pictures of magnetic configurations are displayed upon the panels.\npressure at the base temperature 0.05 K and observe a remarkable (minimal) pressure effect on the Hall conductivity in the 3/1 (KI) state. Our theoretical calculation reveals that the field-induced displacement of Weyl points in the momentum space strongly depends on the respective WSM state as well as on the Kondo coupling strength, leading to the significant variation of Hall effect under pressures as observed.\nA single crystal of Pr2Ir2O7 was grown by KF flux method [37]. We find the strong sample dependence of magnetotransport properties, which is presumably correlated to the local structural imperfections (see details in Ref. [26].) We chose the nearly-stoichiometric sample that reaches the largest magnetoresistance ratio of \u223c50 % at 2 K and 14 T (see Fig. S1(d)), which is much larger than that in the previous report [38]. Magnetization and transport measurements above 0.39 K were performed by using MPMS and PPMS (Quantum Design equipped with 3He refrigerators). The sample was cooled down to 0.05 K of a dilution refrigerator, combined with a Be-Cu pressure cell which allows us to apply the pressure up to 1.5 GPa.\nFigure 1(b) displays the temperature dependence of resistivity \u03c1xx under several hydrostatic pressures. \u03c1xx exhibits metallic-like temperature dependence except for a small upturn at around 50 K, as reported previously [39]. The application of pressure slightly decreases \u03c1xx\nat high temperatures. Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show the temperature dependence of magnetization and specific heat below 2 K, respectively. While the magnetization exhibits a clear cusp at Tc=0.6 K, the specific heat peaks up sharply at 0.5 K. This small but clear discrepancy in temperatures of these anomalies indicates the spin freezing which thus hampers the long-range ordering at Tc, vide infra [41]. The first-order-like-transition feature in specific heat was also reported in stuffed polycrystalline Pr2+xIr2\u2212xO7\u2212\u03b4 [25] which reveals the magnetic Bragg peak with the propagation wave vector qm=[001] below Tc=0.93 K. Remarkably, the observed first-orderlike transition with qm=[001] spin configuration is consistent with the theoretical study by Melko et al. [42], although their model is based on ferromagnetic dipolar interaction. Such a magnetic order is hereafter termed \u2018ordered SI\u2019, which is different from the disordered SI in titanates. It should be noted that the previously reported Tc is somewhat higher than our result, which can imply that the observed magnetic order is very sensitive to the stoichiometry, or equivalently to the carrier density in the Ir electron band. It indicates that the RudermanKittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction mediated by Ir conduction electrons, which is by one order of magnitude larger than the direct exchange interactions between Pr moments [39], plays a key role in the observed magnetic order, as theoretically demonstrated [43]. This suggestion is supported by the absence of long-range order down to 0.02 K in the non-d-electron counterparts Pr2Zr2O7 [45, 46].\nAn important aspect of SI is the series of metamagnetic transitions induced by an external magnetic field H , especially when it is applied along the [111] direction. Figures 1(e)-(g) show H dependence of \u03c1xx and Hall resistivity \u03c1yx at the lowest temperature in this measurement, 0.05 K, and the magnetization curve at 0.39 K for H//[111]. As H increases, \u03c1xx decreases slightly, then stays almost constant between 0.6 and 2 T, and abruptly increases by \u223c40 % at \u00b50Hc=2.5 T, accompanied by a clear hysteresis between increasing and decreasing H . The observed magnetoresistance shows quite a distinct feature in both magnitude and H-dependence from the previously reported result [38]. \u03c1yx also shows a distinct H dependence. Remarkably, \u03c1yx is almost flat up to \u00b50Hc=2.5 T. The changes in both \u03c1xx and \u03c1yx appear to reflect the magnetic transitions. In fact, as shown in Fig. 1(g), the magnetization M exhibits the similar step-like feature and seemingly reaches the expected value for 3/1 state (\u223c2.68 \u00b5B/f.u. [40]), although broadened at the slightly higher temperature (0.39 K). More clearly, dM/dH reveals two peaks at around 0.4 T and 2.3 T, each of which corresponds to the observed anomaly in respective transport properties. Therefore, we conclude that the Pr magnetic moments undergo the H-induced transitions from the ordered SI (\u00b50H <0.6 T) to KI which is the 2/2 state with polarized apical spins\n3 !\"#$%&'('%&)\"*&+\n(0.6 T< \u00b50H <2.5 T), and finally to the fully-polarized 3/1 state (2.7 T< \u00b50H) as depicted on top of Fig. 1(c). It is astounding because the emergence of both KI and SI is not immediately reproduced in the existing theory [44], as actually observed only in a few insulating materials such as Dy2Ti2O7 [7]. Nevertheless, the liquid-gas-like transitions similar to those in dipolar spin ice may occur in the ordered SI phase stabilized by higher-order RKKY interactions, if the long-range RKKY interaction gives rise to effective attractive interactions between the magnetic monopoles [43]. All these findings imply that the Pr local moments undergo a cascade of magnetic transitions even in the metallic system Pr2Ir2O7, in which the quantum-mechanical RKKY interaction plays a vital role in Pr magnetism rather than classical dipolar interactions, and furthermore, have a strong impact on the charge transport via possible topological transitions of the semimetal state.\nFigures 2(a) and 2(b) show H dependence of \u03c1xx and \u03c1yx at several temperatures, respectively. The sharp features of \u03c1xx and \u03c1yx observed at 0.05 K diminish gradually as the temperature is elevated. Nevertheless, the unique H dependence is discernible up to 6 K well beyond Tc. On the other hand, M changes monotonically as functions of temperature andH as shown in Fig. 2(c). To gain more insight into the thermal evolution of the mag-\nnetic state, we measured the temperature dependence of the specific heat at several H as shown in Fig. 2(d). As H increases, the sharp peak below Tc swiftly disappears at a small field of 0.3 T (see Ref. [26]) and other hump structures show up at around 1.4 K and 5 K at 4 T. With further increasing H up to 14 T, the humps progressively shift towards higher temperatures, extending the tail up to \u223c30 K. To extract the magnetic contribution \u2206Cm, we subtract the nuclear Schottky anomaly (denoted by the thick yellow line in Fig. 2(d)) and the lattice contribution estimated by the specific heat of the non-magnetic rare-earth material Eu2Ir2O7 (for details, see Ref. [26]). Figure 2(e) summarizes the temperature dependence of \u2206Cm at several H . A broad peak is centered at T1=2 K and 0 T which possibly reflects the strong spin ice correlation, as predicted by Melko et al. [42]. The peak gradually drifts towards higher temperatures and becomes less pronounced with increasing H as denoted by circles in Fig. 2(e). An additional shoulder-like feature emerges at the lower temperature T2 above 4 T, which slightly shifts to higher temperature asH increases. The observed multiple peaks in \u2206Cm can stem from the Schottky anomalies of Zeeman-split spins [8]. T1 indicates the freezing of the apical spins, i.e. the KI state, due to their larger Zeeman energy gain in the field along the anisotropic axis. On the other hand, the fully-polarized 3/1 state can be realized below T2 at which the total Zeeman energy overcomes the energy barrier of the ice rule.\nWe show a contour plot of \u03c1xx and \u03c1yx in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), combined with T1 and T2 determined by specific\n4 !\"# !$#\n!\"#$%& '\"#$%&\n!%#\n&'()*+\n,'()*+\n&'()*+\n-'()*+\n!!\n!\"\n!#\n!.#(/0\n!!!#\n!\"\n!\"\n!! !#\n!1#(,2- !\"\n!!!#\n*+ 0\n*+\n!\"#$%& (\"#$%&\n1.5\n1.4\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n\u03c1 x x (\nm \u2126\ncm )\n151050\nMagnetic Field (T)\nPr2Ir2O7 H//[111] 0.05 K\n0 GPa\n1.5 GPa\n1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 43210\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\u03c3 x y ( \u2126\n-1 cm\n-1 )\n151050\nMagnetic Field (T)\nPr2Ir2O7 H//[111] 0.05 K\n0 GPa\n1.5 GPa\nFIG. 4.

The top (bottom) figures show the schematic picture for the distribution of Weyl points for respective electronic phases.\nheat (filled circles and triangles) as well as Hc at which the hysteresis of \u03c1xx and \u03c1yx terminates (open triangles). As can be seen, both \u03c1xx and \u03c1yx are overall correlated with the magnetic transition points. For instance, both \u03c1xx and \u03c1yx are enhanced in the high field region below T2, namely at the 3/1 state, indicative of the modulated electronic structure of WSM [22]. Below T1 and 2 T, i.e. the KI phase, \u03c1xx is small while \u03c1yx is relatively large as shown in Fig. 3(b). On the other hand, right above 2.3 T and 0.4 K, where the critical end point terminates the first-order phase transition between the KI and 3/1 phases, \u03c1xx is relatively large as denoted in light green color, while \u03c1yx is small as denoted in red. This can be due to the strong fluctuation inherent to the precedence of the long-range order near the critical point [47, 48].\nDepending on the R (=Nd or Pr) moment order on the pyrochlore sublattice, R2Ir2O7 is expected to show the versatile WSM state with various distributions of Weyl node pairs [14, 15, 22]. In this work, we have experimentally established all the possible 4f moment orders, i.e. two types of 2/2 (SI and KI) orders as well as the 3/1 order, as a function of temperature and H . Each of the magnetic orders has its own WSM state, whose possible distribution of the Weyl node pairs in the momentum space is depicted in the upper and lower panels of Fig. 4(c) (for more detail of band structures, see Ref. [26]). The variation of the magnetotransport presented here can be related to the topological transition among the WSM states induced by the temperature and/or H .\nTo address this scenario, we employ the hydrostatic pressure which allows us to tune the physical parameters, such as the f -d Kondo coupling, without introducing impurities or disorder. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show H dependence of \u03c1xx and Hall conductivity \u03c3xy at 0.05 K of our dilution refrigerator, when the sample is exposed to an ambient pressure and a hydrostatic pressure of 1.5 GPa. As the pressure increases, the value of \u03c1xx remains almost unchanged in the intermediate field region (KI phase) while Hc obviously increases by 0.5 T, as shown in the inset to Fig. 4(a). The transition between KI and 3/1 occurs under the competition between Zeeman energy and ferromagnetic interaction [6]. Therefore, the increase of Hc means that the ferromagnetic RKKY interaction, which is proportional to the square of Kondo coupling JK \u221d t 2 fd/U (tfd and U being f -d transfer interaction and f -electron Coulomb repulsion, respectively), is increased by applying pressure. For large H regime, on the other hand, the pressure decreases \u03c1xx by nearly 15 % at 14 T, suggesting that the electronic state of the 3/1 magnetic ordered phase is sensitive to the external perturbation. More importantly, \u03c3xy above 3 T significantly decreases nearly by half at 1.5 GPa, while \u03c3xy is almost intact below Hc. This cannot be explained simply by the slight decrease of \u03c1xx.\nOne plausible mechanism of the observed Hall effect is the modulation of electronic states endowed with Berry curvature. To investigate this scenario theoretically, we consider a Kondo lattice model with the Kondo coupling JK between Ir J =1/2 electron and Pr 4f moment, which is plugged into the Ir electronic system in pyrochlore lattice characterized by the QBT; the details of the theoretical calculation are described in Ref. [26]. Figure 4(c) shows the calculated results of JK/t (t being Ir d-electron transfer interaction) dependence of \u03c3xy for KI and 3/1 states with schematics of respective electronic states for KI (Fig. 4(d)) and 3/1 (Fig. 4(e)), respectively. \u03c3xy for both KI and 3/1 increases singularly around JK/t=0 as a manifest of QBT [17]. \u03c3xy for the 3/1 state shows a maximum at JK/t \u223c0.02 and then rapidly decreases above it, whereas \u03c3xy keeps increasing for KI. The distinct JK dependence is ascribed to the displacement of Weyl nodes in the momentum space for the respective WSM states. For the 3/1 state, the QBT at \u0393 (k=0) point splits into four pairs of Weyl nodes and moves approximately along the [111] axes. The pair along the field direction, which maintains the three-fold rotation symmetry, eventually meets with each other and annihilates at the L points, turning into a semimetal with three pairs of Weyl nodes (3P WSM described on the right side of Fig. 4e). With further increasing JK/t, the remaining pairs experience annihilations, followed by the emergence of a trivial semimetal and insulator phase. In the course of this transition with increasing JK/t, \u03c3xy shows a non-monotonic curve toward zero in the insulator phase. On the other hand, for the KI state, in which\n5 the net magnetization of the Pr moments is smaller than that for 3/1, Weyl nodes keep from the pair annihilation up to JK/t \u223c0.05. Therefore, \u03c3xy keeps increasing with JK/t.\nIn experiment, the application of the hydrostatic pressure should change both JK and t values, either by changing the lattice constant or by changing the bond angle. Judging from the critical increase of the KI-to-3/1 transition field Hc with pressure (see the inset to Fig.4(a)), the RKKY interaction, and hence the JK/t, is enhanced by the hydrostatic pressure. According to the present calculation shown in Fig.4(c), the increase of JK/t can cause a rapid reduction of \u03c3xy for 3/1 when JK/t \u223c0.035, whereas \u03c3xy remains at a similar value for the KI when JK/t \u223c0.025. Namely, if the JK/t value can increase from \u223c0.025 to \u223c0.035 (by \u223c40 %) with application of 1.5 GPa (as indicated by the yellow shadow in Fig. 4(c)), the large pressure-induced change of \u03c3xy observed only in the 3/1 WSM can be well explained. Note that this change is quite large or pressure-sensitive, yet is roughly in accordance with the observed change (\u223c20%) of the Hc (see the inset to Fig. 4(a)) which also reflects the pressure-induced change of JK/t.\nTo summarize, we investigate the magnetotransport properties of the pyrochlore Pr2Ir2O7 crystal, a material predicted to exhibit rich topological phases. Both the resistivity and Hall resistivity exhibit a plateau-like step and then a discontinuous jump at the critical magnetic fields, indicating a large impact of magnetism on the charge transport. Our theoretical calculation suggests that the Pr2Ir2O7 under magnetic field is in a magnetic Weyl semimetal induced by the f -d coupling. The present experiment-theory combined study demonstrates that the observed magnetic-field- and pressure-induced variations of the Hall effect can arise from the different motions of Weyl points in the momentum space for the versatile WSM, highlighting a promising direction towards the engineering of emergent topological functions.\nWe are grateful to F.
