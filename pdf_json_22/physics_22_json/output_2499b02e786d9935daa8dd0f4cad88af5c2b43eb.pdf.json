INTRODUCTION\nQuantum thermodynamics explores the laws of the thermodynamics in the nanoscale from the perspective of quantum information science [1\u201310]. On such scales, statistical fluctuations become more significant, and have principally been accounted for by the fluctuation theorem [11\u201315]. The discovery of the fluctuation theorem is one of the most important accomplishments in thermodynamics to date [16]. The fluctuation theorem can be regarded as a first principle in thermodynamics, from which many fundamental principles of thermodynamic phenomena can be derived, such as arrow of time [17] and response theory [18,19].\nMore recently, fluctuation theorems have equally been used to characterize information processing tasks. For example, Sagawa and Ueda [20] and Fujitani and Suzuki [21] related the fluctuation theorem with an efficacy of the feedback control for the manipulation of the total entropy production via measurements. The relation between the fluctuation theorem and the adiabaticity of the process was revealed by considering the state distinguishability [22,23]. In the context of quantum computing and communications, Gardas and Deffner [24] demonstrated that the fluctuation theorem can be used to determine the dynamics of the quantum systems and the susceptibility to the thermal noise. Also, Kafri and Deffner [25] related the fluctuation theorem and the Holevo information\n*akira.sone@umb.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\n[26\u201328], which upper bounds the amount of classical information that can be transmitted through the quantum channel.\nA standard approach to the fluctuation theorem in the quantum regime is the two-time measurement (TTM) scheme [29\u201338], in which the distribution of the measurement outcomes is constructed by the projection measurements on the system before and after the process. The first measurement corresponds to the state preparation of the input state, which is an ensemble of the eigenstates of the first measurement weighted by the probabilities of obtaining the corresponding outcomes, while the second measurement can be independent from the output state [25,39].\nWhile this scheme corresponds to the classical approach in stochastic thermodynamics [40], in the quantum regime, it is considered to be inconsistent because it does not take into account the quantum coherence [41] and the informational contribution of back-action of projection measurements [22]. Particularly, for the information production (namely, the von Neumann entropy gain), one needs to fully obtain the information of the output state because the second measurement is strictly dependent on the principal components of the output state, which requires the quantum state tomography. Therefore, from a practical and conceptual perspective, the TTM scheme is infeasible when we want to deal with information production in the context of fluctuation theorem. Also, while there are other approaches beyond the TTM scheme, such as the Bayesian method [42,43] and quasiprobability [44,45], in order to deal with information production, they all strictly require the quantum state tomography; therefore, we need to find an alternative approach to deal with the information production.\nTo solve this problem, we employ a so-called one-time measurement (OTM) scheme, which was proposed by Deffner et al. in Ref. [22]. In this scheme, similar to the TTM scheme,\n2643-1564/2023/5(2)/023039(11) 023039-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nwe perform a projection measurement initially, which corresponds to the state preparation of the input state. However, what differs from the TTM scheme is that the second projection measurement is avoided, so that the corresponding distribution of the measurement outcomes is determined by the conditional expectation of the observable of interest given the initial measurement outcome. This quantity can be estimated if the postmeasurement state of the initial measurement and the dynamics are known. Particularly, for the information production, we do not have to diagonalize the output state in the OTM scheme, so that the OTM scheme is the only option.\nThis paper is organized as the following. In Sec. II, we first propose an information production distribution for an input state of rank r and a quantum channel. Then, we derive the Jarzynski-like equality and the lower bound on the total information production, which particularly becomes significant when we need to consider the information flow of the system in the quantum processes [46,47]. We demonstrate that the lower bound is characterized by the quantum cross-entropy. While there was less attention on the quantum cross-entropy, recently, the relations of the quantum cross-entropy with the maximum likelihood principle in the machine learning [48] and the quantum source coding [49] have been explored. In our paper, we further explore the roles of quantum cross-entropy in various protocols. In Sec. III, we discuss the applications of our result to quantum communications, quantum machine learning, and quantum thermodynamics by focusing on the quantum autoencoder (QAE) protocol [50,51], which is a quantum data compression protocol assisted by the variational quantum algorithms [52\u201357], and the maximum available work theorem [58] in the quantum thermodynamic systems, followed by the conclusion in Sec. IV."

            "text": "Let us consider a Hilbert space H of dimension d \u2261 dim(H). Let B(H) denote the set of the density matrices acting on H. We initially prepare a quantum state \u03c10 \u2208 B(H), and perform a measurement with an observable P \u2261\u2211d\ni=1 a(pi ) i, where i \u2261 |pi\u3009\u3008pi| are the projectors on the eigenbasis of P. Suppose that the outcome is a(pi ). Then, the postmeasurement state is given by |pi\u3009\u3008pi| = i\u03c10 i/pi with pi \u2261 Tr[\u03c10 i]. Then, in general, the input state is given by [25,39]\n\u03c1in = r\u2211\ni=1 pi|pi\u3009\u3008pi|, (1)\nwhere r \u2261 rank(\u03c1in) denotes the rank of the input state. The state \u03c1in is an ensemble of the eigenbasis of the initial measurement P weighted by the probabilities of obtaining the outcomes a(pi ); therefore, we can regard the initial measurement as a protocol of the state preparation of \u03c1in. In this case, pi satisfies the conditions 0 < pi 1 (1 i r), pi = 0 (r + 1 i d ), and \u2211r i=1 pi = 1.\nLet : B(H) \u2192 B(H\u2032) be a quantum channel, which is a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map [59]. Through this channel, the output state \u03c1out \u2208 B(H\u2032) is given by\n\u03c1out \u2261 (\u03c1in). (2)\nThe total information production is defined as\nS \u2261 S(\u03c1out) \u2212 S(\u03c1in), (3) where S(\u03c1) \u2261 \u2212Tr[\u03c1 ln \u03c1] denotes the von Neumann entropy of the quantum state \u03c1.\nHere, we propose the following information production distribution in the OTM scheme [60]:\nP\u0303(\u03c3 ) \u2261 r\u2211\ni=1 pi\u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|), \u03c1out] \u2212 ln pi ), (4)\nwhere C(\u03c11, \u03c12) \u2261 \u2212Tr[\u03c11 ln \u03c12] denotes the quantum cross-entropy of \u03c11 with respect to \u03c12. Let supp(\u03c1) denote the support of a quantum state \u03c1. Then, note that C(\u03c11, \u03c12) < \u221e [supp(\u03c11) \u2286 supp(\u03c12)] and C(\u03c11, \u03c12) = \u221e (otherwise). Also, by definition, we have C(\u03c1, \u03c1) = S(\u03c1). In Eq. (4), due to \u03c1out = (\u03c1in) = \u2211r i=1 pi (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|), we have supp[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|)] \u2286 supp(\u03c1out), so that C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|), \u03c1out] < \u221e.\nWith this distribution, the average of \u03c3 with respect to P\u0303(\u03c3 ) becomes the exact information production\n\u3008\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303 = S(\u03c1out) \u2212 S(\u03c1in) = S, (5) where we used the linearity on the first argument of the quantum cross-entropy [48] and Eq. (2). Let r\u2032 \u2261 rank(\u03c1out) be the rank of the output state. Then, we can interpret the random variable \u03c3 as follows. Let {q j, |q j\u3009}r\u2032j=1 denote an eigensystem of \u03c1out. Let us define the transition probability P( j|i) \u2261 \u3008q j | (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|)|q j\u3009. Then, in the OTM scheme, \u03c3 randomly takes \u2211 j (\u2212 ln q j )P( j|i) + ln pi = \u2211 j (\u2212 ln q j + ln pi )P( j|i), which is the conditional expectation of the information production given the initial measurement outcome.\nHere, \u03c3 can be also identified to be a random variable as a source of the information production S. Therefore, P\u0303(\u03c3 ) is a good definition. Averaging the exponentiated information production with respect to the distribution in Eq. (4), we can obtain our main result.\nTheorem 1 (Jarzynski-like equality of nonequilibrium information production). The Jarzynski-like equality of nonequilibrium information production is\n\u3008e\u2212\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303 = r\u2211\ni=1 e\u2212C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|),\u03c1out], (6)\nwhich results in\nS LOTM, (7) where LOTM is defined as\nLOTM \u2261 \u2212 ln (\nr\u2211 i=1\ne\u2212C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|),\u03c1out] ) . (8)\nProof. From Eqs. (1) and (4), we have \u3008e\u2212\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303 = \u222b d\u03c3 P\u0303(\u03c3 )e\u2212\u03c3\n= r\u2211\ni=1 pie\n\u2212C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|),\u03c1out]e\u2212 ln pi\n= r\u2211\ni=1 e\u2212C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|),\u03c1out],\n(9)\n023039-2\nwhich proves Eq. (6). From Jensen\u2019s inequality \u3008e\u2212\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303 e\u2212\u3008\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303 and Eq. (5), we obtain Eq. (7) [61].\nWhen : B(H) \u2192 B(H) is particularly a unital map [i.e., (1) = 1, where 1 denotes the identity matrix acting on H], it is well known that we have S 0 [62]. However, we can obtain a tighter bound as demonstrated in the following corollary.\nCorollary 1 (Lower bound from a OTM scheme under a unital map). When : B(H) \u2192 B(H) is a unital map, LOTM is a tighter bound on S as\nS LOTM 0. (10) Proof. Given an input state \u03c1in = \u2211r i=1 pi|pi\u3009\u3008pi| of rank\nr, let in \u2261 \u2211r\ni=1 |pi\u3009\u3008pi| ( in \u2261 1 \u2212 in) be the projectors onto the support (null space) of \u03c1in. Let : B(H) \u2192 B(H) be a unital map, i.e., (1) = 1. Because the quantum crossentropy can be lower bounded by using the state overlap [48], we have\nC[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|), \u03c1out] \u2212 ln Tr[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|)\u03c1out]. (11) Then, due to the linearity of the CPTP map, we can obtain\nr\u2211 i=1 e\u2212C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|),\u03c1out] Tr[ ( in)\u03c1out]. (12)\nBecause in + in = 1, from (1) = ( in) + ( in) = 1, (13)\nwe can obtain\nTr[ ( in)\u03c1out] = 1 \u2212 Tr[ ( in )\u03c1out] 1. (14) Therefore, from Eqs. (8), (12), and (13), we obtain Eq. (10), which proves Corollary 1."

            "text": "As our first example, we demonstrate the application of our result in the QAE proposed by Romero et al. in Ref. [50]. The QAE is a quantum analog of the (classical) variational autoencoder [63]. In the QAE, the encoding and decoding operations are described by a parametrized quantum circuit. The original quantum data is compressed to the latent system by tracing over the other subsystem. Then, one prepares the fresh qubits, and decompresses the quantum data through the decoding operation acting on the fresh-qubit system and the latent system. The goal of the protocol is to recover the quantum data in the output, implying that a low-dimensional feature quantum state is well extracted through the encoding process; thus, we can use the resulting decoding process as a generative model to produce a quantum state outside the training quantum dataset by fluctuating the feature state. The cost function dependent on these tunable parameters, which measures the distance between the output and the input state, is constructed by the quantum computer, and the set of the parameters is optimized through training the cost function\nwith the classical computers. Recently, as a practical nearterm quantum algorithm, the QAE has been widely explored both theoretically and experimentally [64\u201375].\nLet us describe the setup of the QAE below. We consider a composite Hilbert space H = HA \u2297 HB, where HA (HB) denotes the Hilbert space of the reduced quantum system A (B). For the following, let us regard HA as the latent Hilbert space, into which we compress our quantum data. Also, let us write d j as the dimension of the reduced Hilbert space H j , d j \u2261 dim(H j ) ( j = A, B), so that the dimension of the total system is given by d = dAdB. Following Ref. [50], we consider the following scenario (see Fig. 1). In this setup, we apply a parametrized unitary U to the input state \u03c1in and perform the partial trace over HB to compress the quantum data into the latent Hilbert space HA. Then, we use the fresh qubits prepared in the state \u03c1B \u2208 B(HB) to decompress the data by applying the unitary U \u2020 to generate the output state \u03c1out. In this case, we have\n\u03c1out = (\u03c1in) \u2261 U \u2020(TrB[U\u03c1inU \u2020] \u2297 \u03c1B)U . (15) To discuss the Jarzynski-like equality, it is convenient to define the compressed states\n\u03c1A \u2261 TrB[U\u03c1inU \u2020], (16)\n\u03c1 (i) A \u2261 TrB[U |pi\u3009\u3008pi|U \u2020]. (17)\nTherefore, we can write \u03c1A = \u2211r i=1 pi\u03c1 (i) A , so that we have supp(\u03c1 (i)A ) \u2286 supp(\u03c1A). Given the setup above, we can relate LOTM to the classical information transmission and the cost function in QAE, which demonstrates the roles of the quantum cross-entropy in quantum communications and quantum machine learning in the framework of QAE protocol.\nLet us first derive the expression of LOTM in QAE. From Eq. (15), we have\nC[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|), \u03c1out] = S(\u03c1B) + C ( \u03c1 (i) A , \u03c1A ) . (18)\nTherefore, we can write\n\u3008e\u2212\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303 = e\u2212S(\u03c1B ) r\u2211\ni=1 e\u2212C(\u03c1 (i) A ,\u03c1A ), (19)\nso that LOTM is given by LOTM = S(\u03c1B) \u2212 ln (\nr\u2211 i=1 e\u2212C(\u03c1 (i) A ,\u03c1A )\n) . (20)\nAn important observation is that \u3008e\u2212\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303 includes two terms which characterize the protocols of the QAE. One is the\n023039-3\nvon Neumann entropy S(\u03c1B), which is the informational contribution from the state preparation protocol in the fresh-qubit system HB. The other one is associated with the quantum cross-entropy C(\u03c1 (i)A , \u03c1A) with respect to the latent Hilbert space HA. This quantity can be regarded as a term characterizing the compression protocol of the QAE. In the following, we explore the roles of the quantum cross-entropy in the quantum communications and quantum machine learning from the relation of the lower bound LOTM to the loss of Holevo information and the global cost function of the QAE."

            "text": "Here, we explore the relation between LOTM and the entropic disturbance. Entropic disturbance is the loss of Holevo information through a given quantum channel [46,76]. Hence, it quantifies the loss of the maximum amount of classical information transmittable through the quantum channel. In Ref. [46], a lower bound on \u03c7 was derived. Here, for a given quantum channel , we provide an upper bound on the entropic disturbance by using LOTM to provide an operational meaning to the quantum cross-entropy in terms of classical information transmission.\nThe entropic disturbance is defined as follows. Let L \u2261 {pi, \u03c1i}ri=1 denote an ensemble of input state \u03c1in \u2261 \u2211r i=1 pi\u03c1i and (L) \u2261 {pi, (\u03c1i )}ri=1 denote the ensemble of output state \u03c1out \u2261 (\u03c1in) = \u2211r i=1 pi (\u03c1i ). Entropic disturbance is\ndefined as \u03c7 \u2261 \u03c7 (L) \u2212 \u03c7 [ (L)], where \u03c7 (L) \u2261 S(\u03c1in) \u2212\u2211r i=1 piS(\u03c1i ) and \u03c7 [ (L)] \u2261 S(\u03c1out) \u2212 \u2211r i=1 piS[ (\u03c1i )] are the Holevo information of \u03c1in and \u03c1out, respectively. In our case, we have \u03c1i = |pi\u3009\u3008pi|, so that S(\u03c1i ) = S(|pi\u3009\u3008pi|) = 0. Therefore, due to S LOTM and Eq. (8), we can obtain\n\u03c7 ln (\nr\u2211 i=1\ne\u2212C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|),\u03c1out] ) + r\u2211\ni=1 piS[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|)],\n(21)\nwhich shows that the upper bound of the entropic disturbance can be characterized by the quantum cross-entropy [77].\nNow, let us consider the case of QAE, in which satisfies Eq. (15). Due to S[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|)] = S(\u03c1 (i)A ) + S(\u03c1B), we have\u2211r i=1 piS[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|)] = \u2211r i=1 piS(\u03c1 (i) A ) + S(\u03c1B), so that the upper bound on \u03c7 in QAE is given by\n\u03c7 r\u2211\ni=1 piS\n( \u03c1\n(i) A ) + ln ( r\u2211 i=1 e\u2212C(\u03c1 (i) A ,\u03c1A ) ) . (22)\nTherefore, the information and the quantum cross-entropy of the compressed states contribute to setting an upper bound on the entropic disturbance in the QAE protocol. Also, note that for the QAE, \u03c7 can be explicitly written as\n\u03c7 = S(\u03c1in) \u2212 S(\u03c1A) \u2212 r\u2211\ni=1 piS\n( \u03c1\n(i) A\n) , (23)\nwhich implies that the loss of the maximum amount of classical information in the QAE protocol is independent of the choice of \u03c1B but strictly dependent on the compressed and input states."

(25), we can finally obtain\nr\u2211 i=1 e\u2212C(\u03c1 (i) A ,\u03c1A ) ( 1\u221a 1 \u2212 C + \u221a(dB \u2212 1)C )2 , (28)\nwhich shows that the quantum cross-entropy plays a role as an informational contribution of the compressed state to the performance of the QAE protocol. Here, note that, due to 0 C 1, we have 0 2 ln( \u221a 1 \u2212 C + \u221a(dB \u2212 1)C ) ln(dB), where C = 0 (i.e., \u03b7B = |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8 |) leads to the minimum, and C = 1 \u2212 1/dB (i.e., \u03b7B = 1B/dB) leads to the maximum.\nWe can also check the consistency of Eq. (27) by considering the optimal case. The optimal unitary U\u2217 is a disentangling gate [75], so that U\u2217 satisfies\nU\u2217\u03c1inU \u2020\u2217 = \u03c1A \u2297 |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8 |, U\u2217|pi\u3009\u3008pi|U \u2020\u2217 = \u03c1 (i)A \u2297 |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8 |.\n(29)\nThen, by using the unitary invariance of the quantum crossentropy, we obtain\nC ( \u03c1\n(i) A , \u03c1A ) = C(\u03c1 (i)A \u2297 |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8 |, \u03c1A \u2297 |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8 |) = C(|pi\u3009\u3008pi|, \u03c1in ) = \u2212 ln pi.\n(30)\nIn this way, we have LOTM = 0. By definition, in the optimal case, we have C = 0; therefore, ln( \u221a 1 \u2212 C + \u221a(dB \u2212 1)C ) = 0. From LOTM S\n2 ln( \u221a 1 \u2212 C + \u221a(dB \u2212 1)C ), we get the expected result S = 0 for the optimal unitary case."

            "text": "For the second example, we explore the role of quantum cross-entropy in work extraction from the quantum\n023039-4\nthermodynamic systems by the relation between LOTM and the maximum available work theorem [58].\nIn Ref. [58], a generic quantum thermodynamic system is regarded as a tripartite system composed of the system, work reservoir, and heat bath. In this setup, the work \u3008W \u3009, the internal energy change of the system Es, and the internal energy change of the heat bath Eb satisfy the first law of thermodynamics Es + Eb = \u3008W \u3009. Also, when S and Sb denote the von Neumann entropy change of the system and heat bath, respectively, the second law of thermodynamics states S + Sb 0. Because the heat reservoir is so large, which can be regarded as being always in equilibrium at inverse temperature \u03b2, we can write Sb = \u03b2 Eb. Then, the maximum available work theorem states\n\u3008W \u3009 Es \u2212 \u03b2\u22121 S \u2261 E, (31) where E is called exergy or availability, which quantifies the maximally available work.\nIn this setup, from Theorem 1, we can obtain the upper bound on the exergy E as\nE Es + \u03b2\u22121 ln (\nr\u2211 i=1\ne\u2212C[ (|pi\u3009\u3008pi|),\u03c1out] ) . (32)\nThis demonstrates the informational contribution of the quantum cross-entropy in extracting maximally available work in quantum thermodynamic systems. If there is no work reservoir, i.e., \u3008W \u3009 = 0, the corresponding maximum available work theorem becomes S \u2212\u03b2 Eb. However, when the system undergoes the energy-emitting process ( Eb 0) described by a unital evolution, from Corollary 1, we have a tighter bound as\nS LOTM \u2212\u03b2 Eb. (33) A good example of the energy-emitting unital evolution is the spin-boson model [79]. Let us consider a system Hs initially prepared in \u03c1in coupled to a heat bath Hb, whose initial state is prepared in the Gibbs state\n\u03c1 eq b \u2261\ne\u2212\u03b2Hb\nZ , (34)\nwhere Z \u2261 Tr[e\u2212\u03b2Hb] is the canonical partition function with inverse temperature \u03b2 and Hb the time-independent bare Hamiltonian of the bath. Then, when is a thermal operation [4\u20136] from t = 0 to t = \u03c4 ,\n\u03c1out = (\u03c1in) = Trb [ U\u03c4 ( \u03c1in \u2297 \u03c1eqb ) U \u2020\u03c4 ] . (35)\nIn the quantum thermodynamic setup of the spin-boson model, Hs and Hb usually describes a two-level atomic system and the bosonic heat bath, respectively (see Fig. 2), and the atomic system in Eq. (35) undergoes the dephasing process, which is described by a unital map. This model can be descried by the following time-independent Hamiltonian (we set h\u0304 = 1):\nH = \u03c90 2\n\u03c3z + Hb + \u03c3z \u2297 \u2211\nk\n(gkak + g\u2217ka\u2020k ), (36)\nwhere\nHb \u2261 \u2211\nk\n\u03c9ka \u2020 kak (37)\nis the bare Hamiltonian of the boson fields, and \u03c3z \u2261 diag(1,\u22121) is Pauli\u2019s Z operator acting on the atom. \u03c90 and \u03c9k are the angular frequencies of the atom and the kth boson mode, and gk denotes the coupling strength between the atom and the kth boson mode. Here, in general gk is a complex number, and g\u2217k denotes the complex conjugate of gk . Also, ak (a \u2020 k ) is the annihilation (creation) operator of the kth mode of the boson fields. Equation (36) describes an interaction between atom and boson fields with multiple modes, which leads to the dephasing process of the atomic system. In the interaction picture, we have\nH (t ) = \u03c3z \u2297 \u2211\nk\n(gkake \u2212i\u03c9kt + g\u2217ka\u2020ke+i\u03c9kt ). (38)\nDuring the evolution from t = 0 to t = \u03c4 , the internal energy change of the heat bath becomes (see Appendix B for the proof)\nEb \u2261 Tr [ U\u03c4 ( \u03c1in \u2297 \u03c1eqb ) U \u2020\u03c4 Hb ] \u2212 Tr[\u03c1eqb Hb] =\n\u2211 k \u03c9k|gk|2 ( sin(\u03c9k\u03c4/2) \u03c9k/2 )2 0, (39)\nwhich shows that the system undergoes the energy-emitting process, which can be verified from the energy conservation of the total system. Considering the noise spectral density J (\u03c9) = \u2211k |gk|2\u03c9\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9k ), we can obtain\nEb = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e J (\u03c9)\n( sin(\u03c9\u03c4/2)\n\u03c9/2\n)2 d\u03c9. (40)\nSince we have lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e sin(\u03c9\u03c4/2)\u03c9/2 = \u03b4(\u03c9/2) = 2\u03b4(\u03c9), where we used the relation lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e(\u03c4 sin(\u03c9\u03c4 )\u03c9\u03c4 ) = \u03b4(\u03c9), we obtain\nlim \u03c4\u2192\u221e Eb = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e 4J (\u03c9)\u03b42(\u03c9)d\u03c9 = 4J (0)\u03b4(0) = 0. (41)\n023039-5\nThis is intuitively consistent because there will be no energy exchange between a small system and a large bath for the dephasing process at time \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e.\nIn the spin-boson model, the work reservoir is not taken into account. Therefore, we have S \u2212\u03b2 Eb. Since the two-level atom undergoes the unital evolution, the total information production has to be S 0. However, from Eq. (39), we have \u2212\u03b2 Eb 0, which shows that the lower bound in the maximum available work theorem for the spin-boson model is not tight enough. Instead, from Corollary 1, we can find that LOTM is the tighter bound as demonstrated in Eq. (33). Because LOTM is characterized by the quantum cross-entropy, the quantum cross-entropy becomes a more meaningful quantity to characterize the quantum process of a system induced from its interaction with a heat bath."

The derived Jarzynski-like equality and the lower bound on the total information production are characterized by the quantum cross-entropy, which further enables one to explore the roles of quantum cross-entropy in quantum communications, quantum machine learning, and quantum thermodynamics. By focusing on the quantum autoencoder, we have explored the informational contributions of the quantum cross-entropy of the compressed states to the loss of the maximum classical information transmittable through the circuit and the performance of the protocol characterized by the global cost function. We have also demonstrated the application of our result in the quantum thermodynamics by exploring the relation between the quantum cross-entropy and the maximum available work theorem. Our result can provide insights of the quantum cross-entropy to assist in designing quantum information processing protocols which utilize the quantum cross-entropy as a resource to achieve some tasks. As a valuable future direction, we will explore the reverse process in the OTM scheme, which still remains open."

(4), the information production distribution in the OTM scheme becomes\nP\u0303(\u03c3 ) = 1 \u03b2 d\u2211 i=1 e\u2212\u03b2Ei Z0 \u03b4 ( \u03c3 \u03b2 + F \u2212 E\u0303 (Ei ) ) , (C4)\nwhere\nE\u0303 (Ei ) \u2261 Tr[ (|Ei\u3009\u3008Ei|)Hs(\u03c4 )] \u2212 Ei, (C5) and\nF \u2261 \u2212\u03b2\u22121 ln (\nZ\u03c4 Z0\n) (C6)\nis the equilibrium Helmholtz free-energy difference. From Ref. [89], P\u0303( Es) is given by\nP\u0303( Es) = d\u2211\ni=1\ne\u2212\u03b2Ei\nZ0 \u03b4( Es \u2212 E\u0303 (Ei )). (C7)\nTherefore, we can write\nP\u0303( Es) = \u03b2P\u0303(\u03c3 ) (C8) with the random variable \u03c3 being\n\u03c3 = \u03b2( Es \u2212 F ). (C9) Following Ref. [89], we have\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b2 Es\u3009P\u0303 = e\u2212\u03b2 F e\u2212\u03b2\u3008Q\u0303\u3009be\u2212S[ sb(\u03c4 )||\u03c1 eq s (\u03c4 )\u2297\u03c1eqb ], (C10)\nwhere\nsb(\u03c4 ) \u2261 d\u2211\ni=1\ne\u2212\u03b2Tr[ (|Ei\u3009\u3008Ei|)Hs (\u03c4 )]\nZ\u0303\u03c4 U\u03c4 (|Ei\u3009\u3008Ei| \u2297 \u03c1eqb )U \u2020\u03c4 (C11)\nis called \u201cguessed state,\u201d and \u3008Q\u0303\u3009b is a heatlike quantity called \u201cguessed heat\u201d defined as\n\u3008Q\u0303\u3009b \u2261 Tr [ Hb\u03c1 eq b ] \u2212 Tr[Hb sb(\u03c4 )]. (C12) This heatlike quantity describes an energy dissipation from the heat bath as if its final state is Trs[ sb(\u03c4 )], the reduced state of the guessed state. From Eqs. (C8) and (C9), we can obtain\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b2 Es\u3009P\u0303 = e\u2212\u03b2 F \u3008e\u2212\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303. (C13) From Eq. (C10), we can finally write\n\u3008e\u2212\u03c3 \u3009P\u0303 = e\u2212\u03b2\u3008Q\u0303\u3009be\u2212S[ sb(\u03c4 )||\u03c1 eq s (\u03c4 )\u2297\u03c1eqb ]. (C14)\nBy using Jensen\u2019s inequality and the non-negativity of the quantum relative entropy, we can arrive at\nS \u2212 \u03b2\u3008Q\u0303\u3009b 0, (C15) which is the second-law-like inequality involving the guessed heat.\n[1] S.

Particularly, a second-law-like inequality involving the guessed heat introduced in Ref. [89] can be derived by using P\u0303(\u03c3 ) (see Appendix C).\n[61] Note that our main claims are the derivation of the general integrated fluctuation theorems, which hold for any states and quantum channels, and its potential of characterizing the quantum protocol with the quantum cross-entropy. We leave the comparison between the tight bound derived in Refs. [46,47] and our bound derived in the OTM scheme as an open problem.\n[62] M. A. Nielsen and I. L.
