    "abstractText": "Stimulated by the observation of the X (6900) from LHCb in 2020 and the recent results from CMS and ATLAS in the di-J/\u03c8 invariant mass spectrum, in this work we systematically study all possible configurations for the ground states of fully heavy tetraquark in the constituent quark model. By our calculation, we present their spectroscopic behaviors including binding energy, lowest meson\u2013 meson thresholds, specific wave function, magnetic moment, transition magnetic moment, radiative decay width, rearrangement strong width ratio, internal mass contributions, relative lengths between (anti)quarks, and the spatial distribution of four valence (anti)quarks. We cannot find a stable S-wave state for the fully heavy tetraquark system. We hope that our results will be valuable to further experimental exploration of fully heavy tetraquark states.",

            "text": "With the birth of the quark model [1\u20133], exotic states beyond conventional hadrons were proposed. The search for exotic hadronic states is full of challenges and opportunities. Since the X (3872) was first reported by the Belle Collaboration in 2003 [4\u20136], a series of charmonium-like or bottomoniumlike exotic states [7\u201321] and Pc states [22\u201324] have been observed experimentally, which stimulates extensive discussions of their properties by introducing the assignments of conventional hadron, compact multiquark states, molecular state, hybrid, glueball, and kinematic effects [7\u201321].\na e-mail: anht14@lzu.edu.cn b e-mail: luosq15@lzu.edu.cn c e-mail: liuzhanwei@lzu.edu.cn d e-mail: xiangliu@lzu.edu.cn (corresponding author)\nIn 2003, the BaBar Collaboration observed a narrow heavy\u2013light state D\u2217s0(2317) in the D+s \u03c00 invariant mass spectrum [25]. However, since the mass of the observed D\u2217s0(2317) is about 100 MeV below the quark model predictions in Ref. [26], it is difficult to understand the D\u2217s0(2317) in a conventional quark model directly, which is referred to as the \u201clow-mass puzzle\u201d of D\u2217s0(2317). In order to solve the low-mass puzzle, the tetraquark explanation with the Qqq\u0304q\u0304 configuration was proposed in Refs. [27\u201329]. Later, the CLEO Collaboration [30] confirmed the D\u2217s0(2317) and announced another narrow resonance Ds1(2460) in the D\u2217+s \u03c00 final states. The low-mass puzzle also happens to the Ds1(2460) [26]. A discussion of the Ds1(2460) as a tetraquark state can be found in Refs. [31\u201338]. In particular, the LHCb Collaboration reported the discovery of two new exotic structures X0(2900) and X1(2900) [39,40], which inspired the study of exotic charmed tetraquarks [41\u201350]. In addition, theorists began to study the doubly charmed tetraquark states in the earlier works [51\u201355]. In 2017, the LHCb Collaboration observed a doubly charmed baryon ++cc (3620) in the +c K\u2212\u03c0+\u03c0+ decay mode [56]. Using the ++cc (3620) as the scaling point, the theorists further explored the possible stable doubly charmed tetraquark states with the QQq\u0304q\u0304 configuration [57\u201366]. Surprisingly, as a candidate of the doubly charmed tetraquark, the T+cc was detected by LHCb in the D0D0\u03c0+ invariant mass spectrum, which has a minimal quark configuration of ccu\u0304d\u0304 [67]. In addition to these singly and doubly charmed tetraquarks, there should be a triply charmed tetraquark. To our knowledge, the triply charmed tetraquark states with the QQQ\u0304q\u0304 configuration have also been studied by various approaches [68\u201372].\nBriefly reviewing the status of heavy flavor tetraquark states, we must mention the fully heavy tetraquark with the QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 configuration, which has attracted the attention of both theorists and experimentalists. Chao et al. suggested\nthat the peculiar resonance-like structures of R(e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons) for \u221a s = 6\u22127 GeV may be due to the production\nof the predicted P-wave (cc)\u2013(c\u0304c\u0304) states in the energy range of 6.4\u20136.8 GeV, which could dominantly decay into charmed mesons [73]. The calculation of the fully heavy tetraquark was then carried out using the potential model [74,75] and the MIT bag model with the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation [76]. This system has also been studied in a nonrelativistic potential model, where no QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 bound state can be found [77]. However, Lloyd et al. adopted a parameterized nonrelativistic Hamiltonian to study such system [78], where they found several closely lying bound states with a large oscillator basis. Later, Karliner et al. estimated the masses of the fully heavy tetraquark states by a simple quark model, and obtained M(Xccc\u0304c\u0304) = 6192\u00b125 MeV and M(Xbbb\u0304b\u0304) = 18826\u00b125 MeV for the fully charmed and fully bottom tetraquarks with the J PC = 0++ quantum number, respectively [79]. Anwar et al. calculated the ground-state energy of the bbb\u0304b\u0304 bound state in a nonrelativistic effective field theory with one-gluon-exchange (OGE) color Coulomb interaction, and the ground-state bbb\u0304b\u0304 tetraquark mass was predicted to be (18.72 \u00b1 0.02) GeV [80]. In Ref. [81], Bai et al. presented a calculation of the bbb\u0304b\u0304 tetraquark ground-state energy using a diffusion Monte Carlo method to solve the nonrelativistic many-body system. Debastiani et al. extended the updated Cornell model to study the fully charmed tetraquark in a diquark\u2013antidiquark configuration [82]. Chen et al. used a moment quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sum rule method to give the existence of the exotic states ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 in the compact diquark\u2013antidiquark configuration, where they suggested searching for them in the J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 and \u03b7c(1S)\u03b71S channels [83].\nWith the accumulation of experimental data, many collaborations have tried to search for it. The CMS Collaboration reported the first observation of the \u03d2(1S) pair production in pp collisions, where there is evidence that a structure around 18.4 GeV with a global significance of 3.6 \u03c3 exists in the fourlepton channel, which is probably a fully bottom tetraquark state [84]. However, this structure was not confirmed by the later CMS analysis [85]. Subsequently, the LHCb Collaboration studied the \u03d2(1S)\u03bc+\u03bc\u2212 invariant mass distribution to search for a possible bbb\u0304b\u0304 exotic meson, but they did not see any significant excess in the range 17.5\u201320.0 GeV [86]. By 2020, the LHCb Collaboration declared a narrow resonance X (6900) in the di-J/\u03c8 mass spectrum with a significance of more than 5\u03c3 [87]. In addition, a broad structure ranging from 6.2 to 6.8 GeV and an underlying peak near 7.3 GeV were reported at the same time [87]. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations recently published their measurements on the di-J/\u03c8 invariant mass spectrum. Here, they not only confirmed the existence of the X (6900), but also found some new peaks [88\u201390]. There have been extensive discussions\nabout the observed X (6900) from different approaches and with different assignments [91\u2013108].\nThe problem of the stability of the fully heavy tetraquark state has long been debated. Debastiani et al. found that the lowest S-wave ccc\u0304c\u0304 tetraquarks may be below the dicharmonium thresholds in their updated Cornell model [109]. The 1+ bbb\u0304c\u0304 state is thought to be a narrow state in the extended chromomagnetic model [110]. However, many other studies have suggested that the ground state of fully heavy tetraquarks is above the di-meson threshold. Wang et al. also calculated the fully heavy tetraquark state in two nonrelativistic quark models with different OGE Coulomb, linear confinement, and hyperfine potentials [111]. Based on the numerical calculations, they suggested that the ground states should be located about 300\u2013450 MeV above the lowest scattering states, indicating that there is no bound tetraquark state. The lattice nonrelativistic QCD method was applied to study the lowest energy eigenstate of the bbb\u0304b\u0304 system, and no state was found below the lowest bottomonium-pair threshold [112]. In another work, Richard et al. claimed that the fully heavy configuration QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 is not stable if one adopts a standard quark model and treats the four-body problem appropriately [113]. Jin et al. studied full-charm and full-bottom tetraquarks using the quark delocalization color screening model and the chiral quark model, respectively, and the results within the quantum numbers J P = 0+, 1+, and 2+ show that the bound state exists in both models [114]. Frankly, theorists have not come to an agreement on the stability of the fully heavy tetraquark state.\nFacing the present status of the fully heavy tetraquark, in this work we adopt the variational method to systematically study the fully heavy tetraquark states, where the mass spectrum of the fully heavy tetraquark is given in the framework of the nonrelativistic quark model associated with a potential containing Coulomb, linear, and hyperfine terms. The constructed total wave functions involved in these systems satisfy the requirement of the Pauli principle. We should emphasize that we can also reproduce the masses of these conventional hadrons with the same parameters, which is a test of our adopted framework. With this preparation, we calculate the binding energies, the lowest meson\u2013meson thresholds, and the rearrangement strong width ratio, and study the stability of the fully heavy tetraquark states against the decay into two meson states. Furthermore, we discuss whether these tetraquarks have a compact configuration based on the eigenvalue of the hyperfine potential matrix. According to specific wave functions, we obtain the magnetic moments, transition magnetic moments, and radiative decay widths, which may reflect their electromagnetic properties and internal structures. We also give the size of the tetraquarks, the relative distances between (anti)quarks, and the spatial distribution of the four valence (anti)quarks for each state. Through the\npresent systematic work, we can test whether compact bound fully heavy tetraquarks exist within the given Hamiltonian.\nThis paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, we present the Hamiltonian of the constituent quark model and list the corresponding parameters in Sect. 2. Then, in Sect. 3, we give the spatial function with a simple Gaussian form and construct the flavor, color, and spin wave functions of the fully heavy tetraquark states. In Sect. 4, we show the numerical results obtained by the variational method and further calculate their magnetic moment, transition magnetic moment, radiative decay width, rearrangement strong width ratio, internal mass contributions, and relative lengths between (anti) quarks. In addition, we compare our results with those of other theoretical groups in Sect. 5. Finally, we end the paper with a short summary in Sect. 6."

For the other six states in the second row, each state has a charge conjugation anti-partner, and their masses, internal mass contributions, and relative distances between (anti)quarks are absolutely identical, so we only need to discuss one of the pair.\nFurthermore, the ccc\u0304c\u0304, bbb\u0304b\u0304, and ccb\u0304b\u0304 states have the two pairs of (anti)quarks which are identical, but only the first two quarks in the ccc\u0304b\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 states are identical.\n3.2 Spatial part\nIn this part, we construct the wave function for the spatial part in a simple Gaussian form. We denote the fully heavy tetraquark state as the Q(1)Q(2)Q\u0304(3)Q\u0304(4) configuration, and choose the Jacobian coordinate system as follows:\nx1 = \u221a\n1/2(r1 \u2212 r2), x2 = \u221a 1/2(r3 \u2212 r4), x3 = [(\nm1r1 + m2r2 m1 + m2\n) \u2212 ( m3r3 + m4r4 m3 + m4 )] . (4)\nHere, we set the Jacobi coordinates with the following conditions:\nm1 = m2 = m3 = m4 = mc, for ccc\u0304c\u0304, m1 = m2 = m3 = m4 = mb, for bbb\u0304b\u0304, m1 = m2 = mc,m3 = m4 = mb, for ccb\u0304b\u0304, m1 = m2 = m3 = mc,m4 = mb, for ccc\u0304b\u0304, m1 = m2 = m3 = mb,m4 = mc, for bbb\u0304c\u0304, m1 = mc,m2 = mb,m3 = mc,m4 = mb, for cbc\u0304b\u0304.\nBased on this, we construct the spatial wave functions of the QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 states in a single Gaussian form. The spatial wave function can satisfy the required symmetry property:\nRs = exp[\u2212C11x21 \u2212 C22x22 \u2212 C33x23], (5) where C11, C22, and C33 are the variational parameters.\nIt is also useful to introduce the center of mass frame so that the kinetic term in the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) can be appropriately reduced for our calculations. The kinetic term, denoted by Tc, is as follows:\nTc = 4\u2211\ni=1\np2i 2mi \u2212 p 2 rC 2M = p 2 x1 2m\u20321 + p 2 x2 2m\u20322 + p 2 x3 2m\u20323 , (6)\nwhere different states have different reduced masses m\u2032i , which are listed in Table 3.\n3.3 Color-spin part\nIn the color space, the color wave functions can be analyzed using the SU(3) group theory, where the direct product of the diquark and antidiquark components reads\n(3c \u2297 3c) \u2297 (3\u0304c \u2297 3\u0304c) = (6c \u2295 3\u0304c) \u2297 (6\u0304c \u2295 3c). (7) Based on this, we get two types of color-singlet states:\n\u03c61 = |(Q1Q2)3\u0304(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)3\u3009, \u03c62 = |(Q1Q2)6(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)6\u0304\u3009. (8) In the spin space, the allowed wave functions are in the\ndiquark\u2013antidiquark picture:\n\u03c71 = |(Q1Q2)1(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)1\u30092, \u03c72 = |(Q1Q2)1(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)1\u30091, \u03c73 = |(Q1Q2)1(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)0\u30091, \u03c74 = |(Q1Q2)0(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)1\u30091, \u03c75 = |(Q1Q2)1(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)1\u30090, \u03c76 = |(Q1Q2)0(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)0\u30090.\n(9)\nIn the notation |(Q1Q2)spin1(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)spin2\u3009spin3, the spin1, spin2, and spin3 represent the spin of the diquark, the spin\nof the antidiquark, and the total spin of the tetraquark state, respectively.\nSince the flavor part and spatial parts are chosen to be fully symmetric for the (anti)diquark, the color-spin part of the total wave function should be fully antisymmetric. Combining the flavor part, we show all possible color-spin parts satisfying the Pauli principle with J PC in Table 4.\nIn addition, it is convenient to consider the strong decay properties, and we again use the meson\u2013meson configuration to represent color-singlet and spin wave functions. The color wave functions in the meson\u2013meson configuration can be derived from the following direct product:\n(3c \u2297 3\u0304c) \u2297 (3c \u2297 3\u0304c) = (1c \u2295 8c) \u2297 (1c \u2295 8c). (10) Based on Eq. (10), they can be expressed as\n\u03c81 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)1(Q2 Q\u03044)1\u3009, \u03c82 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)8(Q2 Q\u03044)8\u3009. (11)\nSimilarly, the spin wave functions in the meson\u2013meson configuration read as\n\u03b61 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)1(Q2 Q\u03044)1\u30092, \u03b62 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)0(Q2 Q\u03044)1\u30091, \u03b63 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)1(Q2 Q\u03044)0\u30091, \u03b64 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)1(Q2 Q\u03044)1\u30091, \u03b65 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)1(Q2 Q\u03044)1\u30090, \u03b66 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)0(Q2 Q\u03044)0\u30090.\n(12)"

To facilitate the discussion in the next subsection, we also define the VC , which is the sum of the Coulomb potential and the linear potential.\nHere, it is also useful to investigate the spatial size of the tetraquarks, which is strongly related to the magnitude of the various kinetic energies and the potential energies between the quarks. It is also important to understand the relative lengths between the quarks in the tetraquarks and their lowest thresholds, and the relative distance between the heavier quarks is generally shorter than that between the lighter quarks [61]. This tendency is also maintained in each tetraquark state according to the corresponding tables."

            "text": "The magnetic moment of hadrons is a physical quantity that reflects their internal structures [121]. The total magnetic\nmoment \u03bctotal of a compound system contains the spin magnetic moment \u03bcspin and the orbital magnetic moment \u03bcorbital from all of its constituent quarks. For ground hadron states, their contribution of the orbital magnetic moment \u03bcorbital is zero, and so we only concentrate on the spin magnetic moment \u03bcspin. The explicit expression for the spin magnetic moment \u03bcspin is written as\n\u03bcspin = \u2211\ni\n\u03bci \u03c3i = \u2211\ni\nQeffi 2Meffi \u03c3i , (15)\nwhere Qeffi and M eff i are the effective charge and effective mass of the i-th constituent quark, respectively. The \u03c3i denotes the Pauli spin matrix of the i-th constituent quark. According to Ref. [122], the effective charge of the quark is affected by other quarks in the inner hadron. We now assume that the effective charge is linearly dependent on the charge of the shielding quarks. Therefore, the effective charge Qeffi is defined as Qeffi = Qi + \u2211\ni = j \u03b1i j Q j , (16)\nwhere Qi is the bare charge of the i-th constituent quark, and \u03b1i j is a corrected parameter that reflects the extent to which the charge of other quarks affects the charge of the ith quark. To simplify the calculation, we also set \u03b1i j always equal to 0.033 according to Ref. [122]. The effective quark masses Meffi contain the contributions from both the bare\nquark mass terms and the interaction terms in the chromomagnetic model, and their values are taken from Ref. [123].\nTo obtain the magnetic moment of the discussed hadron, we calculate the z-component of the magnetic moment operator \u03bc\u0302z sandwiched by the corresponding total wave function \u03b1 (Eq. (9)). Now, only the spin part of the total wave function is involved. The total spin wave functions of the discussed hadrons are written as\n|\u03c7total\u3009 = C1\u03c71 + C2\u03c72 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (17) Based on this, we can quantitatively obtain the magnetic moment of the discussed hadron\n\u03bc = \u3008 \u03b1|\u03bc\u0302z | \u03b1\u3009 = \u3008\u03c7\u03b1|\u03bc\u0302z |\u03c7\u03b1\u3009 = C21\u03bc(\u03c71) + C22\u03bc(\u03c72) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 2C1C2\u03bctr(\u03c71, \u03c72) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(18)\nwhere \u03bctr is the cross-term representing the transition moment, and C1, C2 are the eigenvectors of the given mixing state [124]. Similarly, the transition magnetic moments between the hadrons can be obtained as \u03bcH \u2032\u2192H\u03b3 = \u3008 H f |\u03bc\u0302z | Hi \u3009.\nAccording to Eq. (18), the numerical values for the magnetic moments of the traditional hadrons have been listed in Table 5. Here, \u03bcN = e/2mN is the nuclear magnetic moment with mN = 938 MeV as the nuclear mass, which is the unit of the magnetic moment. For comparison, we also show the experimental values and other theoretical results from Refs. [121,122,124\u2013127]. Because of the \u03bcQ = \u2212\u03bcQ\u0304, the magnetic moment of all the J P = 0+ ground mesons and tetraquarks and the ground states with certain C-parity is 0.\nThe decay property is another important aspect to investigate the nature of the exotic hadron. According to the transition magnetic moments in the above subsection, we can further obtain the radiative decay widths around fully heavy tetraquarks [128\u2013137].\n= |k| 2\n\u03c0\n2 2Ji + 1 M f Mi\n\u2211\nMJ f ,MJi\n|MMJ f ,MJi |2, (19)\nwhere Ji and J f are the total angular momentum of the initial and final hadrons, respectively.

            "text": "In addition to radiative decay, we also consider the rearrangement strong decay properties for fully heavy tetraquarks. Based on Eqs. (10\u201312), the color wave function also falls into two categories: the color-singlet \u03c81 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)1(Q2 Q\u03044)1\u3009, which can easily decay into two S-wave mesons, and the color-octet \u03c82 = |(Q1 Q\u03043)8(Q2 Q\u03044)8\u3009, which can only fall apart by gluon exchange. Thus we transform the total wave\nfunctions \u03b1 into the new configuration, | \u03b1\u3009 = \u2211\ni j\nC \u2032\u03b1i j |F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c8i\u03b6 j ]\u3009. (20)\nAmong the decay behaviors of the tetraquarks, one decay mode is that the quarks simply fall apart into the final decay channels without quark pair creation or annihilation, which is denoted as \u201cOkubo\u2013Zweig\u2013Iizuka (OZI)-superallowed\u201d decays. In this part, we will only focus on this type of decay channel. For two-body decay by L-wave, the partial decay width is expressed as [72,110,138\u2013140]:\ni = \u03b3i\u03b1 k 2L+1\nm2L |ci |2, (21)\nwhere \u03b1 is an effective coupling constant, ci is the overlap corresponding exactly to C \u2032\u03b1i j of Eq. (20), m is the mass of the initial state, and k is the momentum of the final state in the rest frame of the initial state. For the decays of the S-wave tetraquarks, (k/m)\u22122 is of order O(10\u22122) or even smaller, so all higher-wave decays are suppressed, and thus we only need to consider the S-wave decays. As for \u03b3i , it is determined by the spatial wave functions of the initial and final states, which are different for each decay process. In the quark model in the heavy quark limit, the spatial wave functions of the ground S-wave pseudoscalar and the vector meson are the same. The relations of \u03b3i for fully heavy tetraquarks are given in Table 6. Based on this, the branching fraction is proportional to the square of the coefficient of the corresponding component in the eigenvectors, and the strong decay phase space, i.e., k \u00b7 |ci |2, for each decay mode. From the value of k \u00b7 |ci |2, one can roughly estimate the ratios of the relative decay widths between different decay processes of different initial tetraquarks.\nIn the following subsections, we concretely discuss all possible configurations for fully heavy tetraquarks.\n4.2 ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states\nFirst we investigate the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 systems. There are two J PC = 0++ states, one J PC = 1+\u2212 state, and one J PC = 2++ state according to Table 4. We show the masses of the ground states, the variational parameters, the internal mass contributions, the relative lengths between the quarks, their lowest meson\u2013meson thresholds, the specific wave function, the magnetic moments, the transition magnetic moments, the radiative decay widths, and the rearrangement strong width ratios in Tables 7, 8, and 9, respectively.\nHere, we take the J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state as an example, and the others have similar discussions, according to Tables 7, 8, and 9. We now analyze the numerical results obtained from the variational method. For the J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state, its mass is 19240.0 MeV and the corresponding binding energy BT is +461.9 MeV. Its variational\nTable 5 Masses and magnetic moments of some ground hadrons obtained from the theoretical calculations.

We naturally find that C11 is equal to C22, so the distance of (b\u2212b) would be equal to that of (b\u0304 \u2212 b\u0304), and the reason is that the bbb\u0304b\u0304 system is a neutral system.\nThe total wave function in the diquark\u2013antidiquark configuration is given by\n| tot\u3009 = \u22120.936|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c62\u03c76]\u3009 + 0.352|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c61\u03c75]\u3009. (22)\nThe meson\u2013meson configuration is connected to the diquark\u2013 antidiquark configuration by a linear transformation. We then obtain the total wave function in the meson\u2013meson configuration:\n| tot\u3009 = 0.558|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b65]\u3009 + 0.560|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b66]\u3009 + 0.021|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b65]\u3009 + 0.612|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b66]\u3009.\n(23)\nAccording to Eq. (23), we are sure that the overlaps ci of \u03b7b\u03b7b and \u03d2\u03d2 are 0.560 and 0.558, respectively. Then, based on Eq.

            "text": "Here, we concentrate on the relative distances between the (anti)quarks in tetraquarks. Looking at the relative distances in Table 9, we find that the relative distances of (1,2) and (3,4) pairs are the same, and other relative distances are the same in all the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states. This is due to the permutation symmetry for the ground state wave function in each tetraquark [65]. For the c1c2c\u03043c\u03044 and b1b2b\u03043b\u03044 states, they need to satisfy the Pauli principle for identical particles as follows:\nA12| tot\u3009 = A34| tot\u3009 = \u2212| tot\u3009, (29) where the operator Ai j means exchanging the coordinates of Qi (Q\u0304i ) and Q j (Q\u0304 j ).\nMeanwhile, they are pure neutral particles with definite C-parity, so the permutation symmetries for total wave functions are as follows:\nA12\u221234| tot\u3009 = \u00b1| tot\u3009, (30) where A12\u221234 means that the coordinates of the diquark and the antidiquark are exchanged.\nBased on this, the relationship of the relative distances for all the c1c2c\u03043c\u03044 and b1b2b\u03043b\u03044 states can be obtained as follows:\n\u3008 tot|r1 \u2212 r3| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|A\u2212112 A12|r1 \u2212 r3|A\u2212112 A12| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|r2 \u2212 r3| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|A\u2212134 A34|r2 \u2212 r3|A\u2212134 A34| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|r2 \u2212 r4| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|A\u2212112 A12|r2 \u2212 r4|A\u2212112 A12| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|r1 \u2212 r4| tot\u3009, (31)\nand\n\u3008 tot|r1 \u2212 r2| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|A\u2212112\u221234A12\u221234|r1 \u2212 r2||A\u2212112\u221234A12\u221234| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|r3 \u2212 r4| tot\u3009. (32)\nObviously, our theoretical derivations are in perfect agreement with the calculated results in Table 9.\nWe can also prove that three Jacobi coordinates, R1,2 = r1 \u2212 r2, R3,4 = r3 \u2212 r4, and R\u2032 = 1/2(r1 + r2 \u2212 r3 \u2212 r4), are orthogonal to each other for all the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states:\n\u3008 tot|(R1,2 \u00b7 R3,4)| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|(34)\u22121(34)|(R1,2 \u00b7 R3,4)|(34)\u22121(34)| tot\u3009 = \u2212\u3008 tot|(R1,2 \u00b7 R3,4)| tot\u3009 = 0, (33) \u3008 tot|(R1,2 \u00b7 R\u2032)| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|(12)\u22121(12)|(R1,2 \u00b7 R\u2032)|(12)\u22121(12)| tot\u3009 = \u2212\u3008 tot|(R1,2 \u00b7 R\u2032)| tot\u3009 = 0, (34)\nand\n\u3008 tot|(R3,4 \u00b7 R\u2032)| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|(34)\u22121(34)|(R1,2 \u00b7 R\u2032)|(34)\u22121(34)| tot\u3009 = \u2212\u3008 tot|(R3,4 \u00b7 R\u2032)| tot\u3009 = 0. (35) According to the relative distances in Table 9 and the rela-\ntionship of Eqs. (29\u201335), the relative positions of the four valence quarks can be well described for all the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states. Meanwhile, using the relative distances between (anti)quarks and the orthogonal relation, we can also determine the relative distance of (12)\u2013(34), which is consistent with our results in Table 9. We can also give the relative position of Rc and the spherical radius of the tetraquarks. Here, we define Rc as the geometric center of the four quarks (the center of the sphere). Based on these results, we show the spatial distribution of the four valence quarks for the J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state in Fig. 1.\nIn the quark model, a compact tetraquark state has no color-singlet substructure, while a hadronic molecule is a loosely bound state which contains several color-singlet\nTable 7 The masses, binding energies, variational parameters, the internal contribution, total wave functions, magnetic moments, transition magnetic moments, radiative decay widths, rearrangement strong width ratios, and the relative lengths between the quarks for the J PC = 0++, 1+\u2212 ccc\u0304c\u0304 states and their lowest meson\u2013meson thresholds. Here, (i, j) denotes the contribution of the i-th and j-th quarks. The number is\ngiven as i = 1 and 2 for the quarks, and 3 and 4 for the antiquark. The masses and corresponding contributions are given in units of MeV, and the relative lengths (variational parameters) are in units of fm (fm\u22122). Meanwhile, we present a comparison with the other two CMI models [110,123] to further secure the effective quark mass\nhadrons. According to Table 9, we easily find that the relative distances of (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4) quark pairs are all 0.227 or 0.204 fm. Meanwhile, the radius of the state is only 0.130 fm. Thus, in this state, all the distances between the quark pairs are roughly the same order of magnitude. If it is a molecular configuration, the distances between two quarks and two antiquarks should be much greater than the distances in the compact multiquark scheme, and the radius of molecular configuration can reach several femtometers. Therefore, our calculations are consistent with the compact tetraquark expectations."

            "heading": "4.2.2 The internal contribution",
            "text": "Let us now turn our discussion to the internal mass contribution for the J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state.\nFirst, for the kinetic energy, this bbb\u0304b\u0304 state has 814.0 MeV, which can be understood as the sum of three internal kinetic energies: kinetic energies of two pairs of the b \u2212 b\u0304, and the (bb\u0304)\u2212 (bb\u0304) pair. Accordingly, the sum of the internal kinetic energies of the \u03b7b\u03b7b state only comes from the two pairs of the b\u2212 b\u0304. Therefore, this bbb\u0304b\u0304 state has an additional kinetic energy needed to bring the \u03b7b\u03b7b into a compact configuration. The actual kinetic energies of two pairs of the b \u2212 b\u0304 in the J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state are smaller than those in the \u03b7b\u03b7b state. This is because, as can be seen in Table 9, the distance of b \u2212 b\u0304 is larger in the tetraquark state than in the meson: the distance of b \u2212 b\u0304 is 0.204 fm in this bbb\u0304b\u0304 state, while it is 0.148 fm in \u03b7b. Meanwhile, we find that even if we consider the additional kinetic energy between the (bb\u0304) \u2212 (bb\u0304) pair, the total kinetic energy in this bbb\u0304b\u0304 state is still smaller than that in the \u03b7b\u03b7b state. However, this does not lead the ground J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 state to a stable state because of the confinement potential part.\nAs for the confinement potential part, the contributions from VC for the J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state in Table 9 are all attractive. Thus, this state has a large positive binding energy. However, it is still above the meson\u2013meson threshold because the VC (bb\u0304) in \u03b7b is very attractive. As for the other internal contributions, the quark contents of this state are the same as the corresponding rearrangement decay threshold. Moreover, the mass contribution from the hyperfine potential term is negligible compared to the contributions from other terms."

            "heading": "4.2.3 Comparison with two models of chromomagnetic interaction",
            "text": "Now, we compare the numerical values for the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 systems between the constituent quark model and two CMI models [110,123] in Tables 7, 8, and 9. The comparisons of the values for ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states, which are in the last three columns of Tables 7, 8, and 9, can be summarized in the following important conclusions.\nFirst, we find that there is no stable state below the lowest heavy quarkonium pair thresholds in any of the models. In all three models, we consider two possible color configurations, the color-sextet |(QQ)3c(Q\u0304 Q\u0304)3\u0304c \u3009 and the color-triplet |(QQ)6c(Q\u0304 Q\u0304)6\u0304c \u3009. According to the extended chromomagnetic model [110], the ground state is always dominated by the color-sextet configuration. This view is consistent with the specific wave function of the ground state in Eq. (22) given by the constituent quark model.\nIn contrast, the masses obtained from the constituent quark model are systematically larger than those from the extended CMI model [110] according to Tables 7, 8, and 9. Meanwhile, the masses obtained from the CMI model [123] are obviously larger than those of the constituent quark model. Their mass differences are mainly due to the effective quark masses as given in the last three columns of Tables 7, 8, and 9. The effective quark masses are the sum of the quark mass, the relevant kinetic term, and all the relevant interaction terms in the constituent quark model, which indeed seems to approximately reproduce the effective quark mass from two CMI models [110,123]. We compare the subtotal values of the c and c\u0304 quark part in Table 8. The c effective quark mass in the constituent quark model is 3225 MeV, which is about 100 MeV larger than that of the extended CMI model in the J PC = 0++ ccc\u0304c\u0304 state. Correspondingly, we also find that the c effective quark mass in the CMI model [123] is 3450 MeV, and about 200 MeV larger than that of the constituent quark model. The effective quark masses in the extended CMI model depend on the parameters of the traditional hadron. However, the effective quark masses should be different depending on whether they are inside a meson, a baryon, or a tetraquark. The effective quark masses trend to be large when they are inside configurations with larger con-\nstituents in the extended CMI model, as can be seen from the comparisons of the last three columns in Tables 7, 8, and 9. Moreover, we note that a similar situation occurs in the udc\u0304c\u0304 state in Table X of Ref. [61].\n4.3 ccb\u0304b\u0304 state\nHere, we will concentrate on the ccb\u0304b\u0304 system. Similar to the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 systems, the ccb\u0304b\u0304 system is satisfied with fully antisymmetry for diquarks and antiquarks. There are two J P = 0+ states, one J P = 1+ state, and one J P = 2+ state in the ccb\u0304b\u0304 system. We show the masses of the ground states, the variational parameters, the internal mass contributions, the relative lengths between the quarks, their lowest meson\u2013meson thresholds, the specific wave function, the magnetic moments, the transition magnetic moments, the radiative decay widths, and the rearrangement strong width ratios in Tables 11 and 12.\nFirst, we take the J P = 0+ ccb\u0304b\u0304 ground state as an example to discuss its properties with the variational method. A similar situation occurs in the other two quantum numbers according to Tables 11 and 12. The mass of the lowest J P = 0+ ccb\u0304b\u0304 state is 12,920.0 MeV, and the corresponding binding energy BT is +344.2 MeV according to Table 11. Thus, the state is obviously higher than the corresponding rearrangement meson\u2013meson thresholds. The wave function is given by\n| tot\u3009 = \u22120.966|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c61\u03c75]\u3009 + 0.259|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c62\u03c76]\u3009. (36)\nHere, we see that the mass contribution of the ground state comes mainly from the |(Q1Q2)3\u03041(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)31\u30090 component, and the |(Q1Q2)60(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)6\u03040\u30090 component is negligible. Its variational parameters are given as C11 = 23.9 fm\u22122, C22 = 10.5 fm\u22122, and C33 = 12.3 fm\u22122.\nThe meson\u2013meson configuration is connected to the diquark\u2013antidiquark configuration by a linear transformation. Then, we obtain the total wave function in the meson\u2013 meson configuration:\n| tot\u3009 = \u22120.589|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b65]\u3009 + 0.095|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b66]\u3009 + 0.608|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b65]\u3009 + 0.524|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b66]\u3009.\n(37)\nAccording to Eq. (37), we are sure that the overlaps ci of BcBc and B\u2217c B\u2217c are 0.095 and 0.589, respectively. Then, based on Eq. (21), the rearrangement strong width ratios is\nTc2 b\u03042 (12920.0,0 +)\u2192B\u2217c B\u2217c Tc2 b\u03042 (12920.0,0 +)\u2192BcBc = 1:50, (38)\ni.e., BcBc is the dominant rearrangement decay channel for the Tc2b\u03042(12920.0, 0 +) state.\nAs for the magnetic moment of the J P = 0+ ccb\u0304b\u0304 ground state, its value is 0, while the magnetic moment of all J P = 0+ tetraquark states is 0. As for the J P = 1+ ccb\u0304b\u0304 state, we construct its flavor \u2297 spin wave functions as\n| \u3009S=1;Ss=1Tc2 b\u03042 (12939.9,1+) = |Rs\u3009|\u03c8\u3009|ccb\u0304b\u0304\u3009|1\n2 (\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2193 + \u2191\u2191\u2193\u2191 \u2212 \u2193\u2191\u2191\u2193 \u2212 \u2193\u2191\u2193\u2191\u3009.\n(39)\nSo the corresponding transition magnetic momentum is\n\u03bcTc2 b\u03042 (12939.9,1 +) = \u3008 1+tot |\u03bc\u0302z | 1 + tot \u3009 = \u03bcc + \u03bcb\u0304 = 0.490\u03bcN . (40)\nWe also discuss the transition magnetic moment of the Tc2b\u03042(12939.9, 1\n+) \u2192 Tc2b\u03042(12920.0, 0+)\u03b3 process. We still construct their flavor \u2297 spin wave functions as\n| \u3009S=1;Ss=0Tc2 b\u03042 (1+) = |R s\u3009|\u03c8\u3009|ccb\u0304b\u0304\u3009| 1\u221a 2 (\u2191\u2191\u2193\u2193 \u2212 \u2193\u2193\u2191\u2191)\u3009, | \u3009S=0;Ss=0Tc2 b\u03042 (0+) = |R s\u3009|\u03c8\u3009|ccb\u0304b\u0304\u3009\n|0.966 1\u221a 3 (\u2191\u2191\u2193\u2193 + \u2193\u2193\u2191\u2191) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009. (41)\nAnd then the transition magnetic momentum of the Tc2b\u03042(12939.9, 1\n+) \u2192 Tc2b\u03042(12920.0, 0+)\u03b3 process can be described by the z-component of the magnetic moment operator \u03bc\u0302z sandwiched by the flavor-spin wave functions of the Tc2b\u03042(12939.9, 1\n+) and Tc2b\u03042(12920.0, 0+). Thus the corresponding transition magnetic momentum is\n\u03bcTc2 b\u03042 (12939.9,1 +)\u2192Tc2 b\u03042 (12920.0,0+)\u03b3 = \u3008 1 + tot |\u03bc\u0302z | 0 + tot \u3009\n= 0.966 \u00d7 1\u221a 6 (4\u03bcc \u2212 4\u03bcb\u0304) = 0.534\u03bcN . (42)\nFurther, according to Eqs. (19) and (42), we also obtain the radiative decay widths\nTc2 b\u03042 (12960.9,2 +)\u2192Tc2 b\u03042 (12939.9,1+)\u03b3 = 3.6 keV. (43)\nFinally, we turn to the internal contribution for the ccb\u0304b\u0304 ground state. For the kinetic energy part, the J P = 0+ ccb\u0304b\u0304 state receives 835.9 MeV, which is smaller than that of the meson\u2013meson threshold BcBc. The potential part of this state is much smaller than that of the lowest meson\u2013 meson threshold. Furthermore, we find that all the VC for this state are attractive. However, compared to the VC of BcBc, these attractive values seem trivial. This is because the length between c\u2212 b\u0304 in tetraquarks is longer than that in Bc according to Tables 11 and 12. In summary, we tend to think that these ccb\u0304b\u0304 states are unstable compact states.\n4.4 ccc\u0304b\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 states\nHere, we discuss the ccc\u0304b\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 systems. For these two systems, they only need to satisfy the antisymmetry for the diquark. Thus, compared to the above three systems, the ccc\u0304b\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 systems have more allowed states. There are two J P = 0+ states, three J P = 1+ states, and one J P = 2+ state in the ccc\u0304b\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 systems. We calculate the masses of the ground states, the corresponding variational parameters, the various internal contributions, the relative lengths between the quarks, their lowest meson-meson thresholds, specific wave functions, magnetic moments, transition magnetic moments, radiative decay widths, and rearrangement strong width ratios in Tables 13, 14, and 15, respectively.\nWe now analyze the numerical results of the J P = 1+ ground bbb\u0304c\u0304 state obtained from the variational method according to Table 14. Other states would have similar discussions from Tables 13, 14, and 15. The mass of the lowest J P = 1+ bbb\u0304c\u0304 state is 16043.2 MeV, and the corresponding binding energy BT is +303.7 MeV. Thus, the state is obviously above the lowest rearrangement meson\u2013meson decay channel B\u2217c \u03b7b, and it is an unstable tetraquark state. Its variational parameters are given as C11 = 12.4 fm\u22122, C22 = 21.0 fm\u22122, and C33 = 28.9 fm\u22122. The corresponding wave function is given by\n| tot\u3009 = 0.984|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c62\u03c74]\u3009 + 0.171|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c61\u03c73]\u3009 \u2212 0.044|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c61\u03c72]\u3009. (44)\nHere, we note that the mass contribution of the ground state comes mainly from the |(Q1Q2)60(Q\u03043 Q\u03044)6\u03041\u30091 component, and the other two components are negligible. Then we transform Eq. (44) into the meson\u2013meson configuration via a linear transformation, and the corresponding wave function is given as\n| tot\u3009 = 0.494|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b62]\u3009 \u2212 0.396|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b63]\u3009 \u2212 0.487|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b64]\u3009 + 0.111|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b62]\u3009 \u2212 0.246|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b63]\u3009 \u2212 0.537|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b64]\u3009.\n(45)\nFurthermore, we can be sure that its rearrangement strong width ratios are\nTb2 b\u0304c\u0304(16043.2,1 +)\u2192B\u2217c \u03d2 : Tb2 b\u0304c\u0304(16043.2,1+)\u2192Bc\u03d2 : Tb2 b\u0304c\u0304(16043.2,1 +)\u2192B\u2217c \u03b7b = 1:1.3:1.5. (46)\nAnd its radiative decay widths are\nTb2 b\u0304c\u0304(16149.2,2 +)\u2192Tc2 c\u0304b\u0304(16043.2,1+)\u03b3 = 435.0 keV,\nTc2 c\u0304b\u0304(16043.9,0 +)\u2192Tc2 c\u0304b\u0304(16043.2,1+)\u03b3 = 10\u22126 keV.\nLet us now focus on the internal contributions for this state and the relative lengths between the quarks. For the kinetic energy part, the state obtains 876.1 MeV, which is obviously\nsmaller than that of the lowest meson\u2013meson threshold Bc\u03b7b. The actual kinetic energy of the b\u2212 b\u0304 (b\u2212 c\u0304) in the J P = 1+ bbb\u0304c\u0304 state is smaller than that in the \u03b7b (B\u2217c ) meson. The reason for this can be seen in Table 14. The size of this pair is larger in the J P = 1+ bbb\u0304c\u0304 state than in the meson: the distance (3,4) is 0.245 fm in this tetraquark, while it is 0.148 fm in \u03b7b.\nHere, let us turn our discussion to the potential parts. The potential part of this state is much smaller than that of its lowest meson\u2013meson threshold. Although the VC between quark and antiquark are attractive, the VC in the diquark and antiquark are repulsive. However, relative to the \u03b7b and Bc mesons, the VC in the tetraquark are less attractive. Therefore, they still have relatively large positive binding energy in this state.\n4.5 cbc\u0304b\u0304 state\nFinally, we investigate the cbc\u0304b\u0304 system. Similar to the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 systems, the cbc\u0304b\u0304 system is a pure neutral system and has a certain C-parity. Thus the corresponding magnetic moment is 0\u03bcN for all the ground cbc\u0304b\u0304 states. Moreover, the Pauli principle does not impose any constraints on the wave functions of the cbc\u0304b\u0304 system. Thus, compared to other tetraquark systems discussed above, the cbc\u0304b\u0304 system has more allowed states. There are four J PC = 0++ states, four J PC = 1+\u2212 states, two J PC = 1++ states, and two J PC = 2++ states in the cbc\u0304b\u0304 system.\nWe now analyze the numerical results for the cbc\u0304b\u0304 system obtained from the variational method. Here, we take the J PC = 0++ cbc\u0304b\u0304 ground state as an example for discussion, and others would have similar discussions. The mass of the lowest J PC = 0++ cbc\u0304b\u0304 state is 12,759.3 MeV, and the corresponding binding energy BT is +371.8 MeV. Thus, the state obviously has a larger mass than the lowest rearrangement meson\u2013meson decay channel \u03b7b\u03b7c, and it should be an unstable compact tetraquark state. Its variational parameters are given as C11 = 11.9 fm\u22122, C22 = 11.9 fm\u22122, and C33 = 22.9 fm\u22122. Since this state is a pure neutral state, we naturally find that the value of C11 is equal to C22, which means that the distance of (b \u2212 b) is equal to (b\u0304 \u2212 b\u0304). Our results also reflect these properties according to Table 16. The corresponding wave function is given as\ntot = 0.961|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c62\u03c75]\u3009 + 0.114|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c62\u03c76]\u3009 \u2212 0.069|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c61\u03c75]\u3009 \u2212 0.241|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c61\u03c76]\u3009.\n(47)\nBased on Eq. (47), we find that its mass contribution to the ground state comes mainly from the 6 \u2297 6\u0304 component, the corresponding 3 \u2297 3\u0304 component being negligible. Then we transform Eq. (47) into cc\u0304 \u2212 bb\u0304 and cb\u0304 \u2212 bc\u0304 configurations via a linear transformation, and the corresponding two wave functions are given as\n| tot\u3009 = \u22120.830|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b65]\u3009 + 0.211|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c81\u03b66]\u3009 \u2212 0.367|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b65]\u3009 + 0.363|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c82\u03b66]\u3009\n= \u22120.668|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c8 \u20321\u03b6 \u20325]\u3009 + 0.333|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c8 \u20321\u03b6 \u20326]\u3009 \u2212 0.398|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c8 \u20322\u03b6 \u20325]\u3009 + 0.533|F\u3009|Rs\u3009|[\u03c8 \u20322\u03b6 \u20326]\u3009.\n(48)\nFurther, we can ascertain its rearrangement strong width ratios. For the cb\u0304 \u2212 bc\u0304 decay mode Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12796.9,1\n+\u2212)\u2192B\u2217c B\u0304\u2217c : Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12796.9,1+\u2212)\u2192B\u2217c B\u0304c : Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12796.9,1\n+\u2212)\u2192Bc B\u0304\u2217c = 1:3.9:3.9, (49) where both the B\u2217c B\u0304c and Bc B\u0304\u2217c channels are the dominant decay modes for the Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12796.9, 1 +\u2212) tetraquark state.\nTcbc\u0304b\u0304(12796.9,1 +\u2212)\u2192\u03b7b J/\u03c8 : Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12796.9,1+\u2212)\u2192\u03d2\u03b7c\n= 1:18.4. (50) The dominant decay channel is the \u03d2\u03b7c final states in the cc\u0304 \u2212 bb\u0304 decay mode.\nWe also calculate the transition magnetic moments for this state:\n\u03bcTcbc\u0304b\u0304(12882.4,2 ++)\u2192Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12759.6,0++)\u03b3 = 0, \u03bcTcbc\u0304b\u0304(12856.6,1 ++)\u2192Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12759.6,0++)\u03b3 = 0, \u03bcTcbc\u0304b\u0304(12796.9,1 +\u2212)\u2192Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12759.6,0++)\u03b3 = 0.081, (51)\nwhich are in units of \u03bcN . Furthermore, we can obtain its radiative decay widths as\nTcbc\u0304b\u0304(12882.4,2 ++)\u2192Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12759.6,0++)\u03b3 = 0, Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12856.6,1 ++)\u2192Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12759.6,0++)\u03b3 = 0, Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12797.3,1 +\u2212)\u2192Tcbc\u0304b\u0304(12759.6,0++)\u03b3 = 33.1, (52)\nwhich are in units of keV. Let us now turn our discussion to the internal contribution for the J PC = 1+\u2212 cbc\u0304b\u0304 ground state. For the kinetic energy part, the state obtains 858.5 MeV, which is smaller than the 1001.2 MeV of the lowest meson\u2013meson threshold Bc\u03b7b according to Table 16. As for the potential part, although the VC between quark and antiquark are attractive, the VC in the diquark and antiquark are repulsive. However, relative to the lowest meson\u2013meson threshold Bc\u03b7b, the total VC is less attractive than the Bc\u03b7b, which leads to this state having a relatively larger mass.\nWe also note that the VC (1, 3), VC (2, 3), VC (1, 4), and VC (2, 4) are absolutely the same, and meanwhile the distances of (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), and (2,4) are also the same. These actually reflect \u3008 tot|(R1,2 \u00b7R3,4)| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|(R1,2 \u00b7 R\u2032)| tot\u3009 = \u3008 tot|(R3,4 \u00b7 R\u2032)| tot\u3009 = 0. Obviously, it is unreasonable that the distance of cc\u0304 is exactly the same as that of the cb\u0304 and bb\u0304. According to Sec IV of Ref. [65], it is not sufficient to consider only the single Gaussian form where the spatial part of the wave function is l1 = l2 = l3 = 0 in\nthe spatial part of the total wave function is not sufficient. These lead to the cbc\u0304b\u0304 state, which is far away from the real structures in nature. We have reason enough to believe that the \u3008 tot|(R1,2 \u00b7 R3,4)| tot\u3009 should not be zero. Meanwhile, considering other spatial basis would reduce the corresponding binding energy BT [65]. But these corrections would be powerless against the higher binding energy BT of the ground J PC = 1+\u2212 cbc\u0304b\u0304. In conclusion, we tend to think that the J PC = 1+\u2212 cbc\u0304b\u0304 ground state should be an unstable compact state."

In addition, these fully heavy tetraquark systems have been discussed with different color structures such as the 8QQ\u0304 \u22978QQ\u0304 configuration, the diquark\u2013antiquark configuration (3\u22973\u0304 and the 6 \u2297 6\u0304), and the couplings between the above color configurations. For comparison, we briefly list our results and other theoretical results in Table 10.\nCompared to other systems, the most extensive discussion is found for the ccc\u0304c\u0304 system. Thus, we will concentrate on the ccc\u0304c\u0304 system, but other systems can be discussed in a similar way. After comparing our results with those of other studies, we can see that most theoretical masses of ccc\u0304c\u0304 in ground states lie in a wide range of 6.0\u20136.8 GeV in Table 10. Our results are 6.38, 6.45, and 6.48 GeV for the 0++, 1+\u2212, and 2++ ccc\u0304c\u0304 ground states, respectively. These three ground states are expected to be broad because they can all decay to charmonium pairs \u03b7c\u03b7c, \u03b7c J/\u03c8, or J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 through the quark (antiquark) rearrangements. Therefore, these types of decays are favored both dynamically and kinematically. According to Table 10, we can conclude that the obtained masses of the ground states are obviously smaller than the X (6900) observed by the LHCb Collaboration. The observed X (6900) is less likely to be the ground compact tetraquark state and could be a first or second radial excited ccc\u0304c\u0304 state.\nAlthough we all use a similar Hamiltonian expression as in the nonrelativistic constituent quark model [111,141\u2013143], the spatial wave function is mostly expanded in the Gaussian basis according to Ref. [144], while we treat the spatial function as a Gaussian function, which is convenient for use in further variational methods to handle calculations in the fourbody problem. Our results for the ccc\u0304c\u0304 system are roughly compatible with other nonrelativistic constituent quark models, although different papers have chosen different potential forms.\nIt is also interesting to note that relatively larger results are also given by the QCD sum rules [145], the Monte Carlo method [146], the diquark model [147], and the chiral quark model [148]. However, the results given by the QCD sum rules [145] are about 1 GeV below those of the constituent quark models for the bbb\u0304b\u0304 system. In contrast, our results are obviously larger than the chromomagnetic models [79,107,110,123] and the diquark models [100,149], where these models usually neglect the kinematic term and explicitly include confining potential contributions or adopt a diquark picture."

            "text": "The discovery of exotic structures in the di-J/\u03c8 invariant mass spectrum from the LHCb, CMS, and ATLAS collaborations gives us strong confidence to investigate the fully heavy tetraquark system. Thus, we use the variational method to systematically calculate the masses of all possible configurations for fully heavy tetraquarks within the framework of the constituent quark model. Meanwhile, we also give the corresponding internal mass contributions, the relative lengths between (anti)quarks, their lowest meson\u2013meson thresholds, the specific wave function, magnetic moments, transition magnetic moments, the radiative decay widths, rearrangement strong width ratios, and comparisons with the two different CMI models.\nTo obtain the above results, we need to construct the total wave functions of the tetraquark states, including the flavor part, color part, spin part, and spatial part, which is chosen to be a simple Gaussian form. Here, we first estimate the theoretical values of traditional hadrons, which are used to compare the experimental values to prove the reliability of this model. Before discussing the numerical analysis, we analyze the stability condition using only the color-spin interaction. Then, we obtain the specific numerical values and show them in corresponding tables and the spatial distribution of valence quarks for the J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state in Fig. 1.\nFor the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 systems, there are two pure neutral systems with definite C-parity. There are only two J PC = 0++ states, one J PC = 1+\u2212 state, and one J PC = 2++ state, due to the Pauli principle. We also find that these states with different quantum numbers are all above the lowest thresholds, and have larger masses. Since these states are pure neutral particles, the corresponding magnetic moments are all 0 for the ground ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states. Meanwhile, of course, the variational parameters C11 and C22 are the same, so the distances of the diquark and antidiquark are also the same. Moreover, the distances between quark and antiquark are all the same according to the symmetry analysis of Eqs. (31\u201332). Furthermore, three Jacobi coordinates are orthogonal to each other according to Eqs. (33\u201335). Based on this, we take the\nJ PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state as an example to show the spatial distribution of four valence quarks. As for the internal contribution, although the kinetic energy part is smaller than that of the \u03b7b\u03b7b state, the VC in \u03b7b is much more attractive relative to the J PC = 0++ bbb\u0304b\u0304 ground state, which is the main reason that this state has a larger mass than the meson\u2013 meson threshold. Similar situations occur in other systems.\nSimilar to the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 systems, the ccb\u0304b\u0304 system has the same number of allowed ground states. According to the specific function, their mass contribution comes mainly from the 3\u0304\u22973 component within the diquark\u2013antiquark configuration. Furthermore, we obtain the relevant values of the magnetic moments, the transition magnetic moments, and the radiative decay widths. We also obtain the rearrangement strong width ratios within the meson\u2013meson configuration.\nAs for the ccc\u0304b\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 systems, there are more allowed states due to fewer symmetry restrictions. Considering only the hyperfine potential, we can expect to have a compact stable state for the J P = 1+ bbb\u0304c\u0304 configuration. However, since the VC of the tetraquark are less attractive than the corresponding mesons, this state still has a mass larger than the meson\u2013meson threshold.\nIn the cbc\u0304b\u0304 system, these states are also pure neutral particles, and we naturally obtain that their variational parameters C11 and C22 are the same. There is no constraint from the Pauli principle, so there are four J PC = 0++ states, four J PC = 1+\u2212 states, two J PC = 1++ states, and two J PC = 2++ states. All of the cbc\u0304b\u0304 states have larger masses relative to the lowest thresholds. Moreover, they all have two different rearrangement strong decay modes: cc\u0304 \u2212 bb\u0304 and cb\u0304 \u2212 bc\u0304.\nThen we compare our results with other theoretical work. Our results are roughly compatible with other nonrelativistic constituent quark models, although different papers have chosen different potential forms. Meanwhile, it is also interesting to find that similar mass ranges are given by the QCD sum rules, the Monte Carlo method, and the chiral quark model. This shows that our results are quite reasonable.\nIn summary, our theoretical calculations show that the masses of the ccc\u0304c\u0304 ground states are around 6.45 GeV, which is obviously lower than 6.9 GeV. Thus, the experimentally observed X (6900) state does not seem to be a ground ccc\u0304c\u0304 tetraquark state, but could be a radially or orbitally excited state. We also find that these lowest states all have a large positive binding energy BT . In other words, all these states are found to have masses greater than the corresponding two meson decay thresholds via the quark rearrangement. Hence, we conclude that there is no compact bound fully heavy tetraquark ground state which is stable against the strong decay into two mesons within the constituent quark model. Finally, we hope that more relevant experimental analyses will be able to focus on this system in the near future.\nAcknowledgements This work is supported by the China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists under Grant No. 11825503, National Key Research and Development Program of China under Contract No. 2020YFA0406400, the 111 Project under Grant No. B20063, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 12247101, and the project for top-notch innovative talents of Gansu province.
