 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further optimize the fermentation process and media composition to reduce production costs of sophorolipids. This could involve testing different cheap carbon sources, optimizing oxygen supply, using fed-batch strategies, or developing continuous fermentation processes. 

2. Explore the antimicrobial mechanism of lactonic versus acidic sophorolipids against cyanobacteria through microscopy, membrane permeability assays, and studies on biofilm disruption. This could reveal key structural features for activity.

3. Test the sophorolipids against other harmful algal bloom species beyond cyanobacteria, such as dinoflagellates. Determine optimal ratios and treatment strategies for different species.

4. Conduct field trials treating ponds or small lakes affected by harmful algal blooms using the optimized sophorolipid formulations. Monitor effects on water quality, ecology, and toxin levels over time. 

5. Develop sophorolipid-containing slow-release formulations or devices to allow sustainable treatment of larger water bodies over longer time periods. This could reduce the need for frequent re-application.
