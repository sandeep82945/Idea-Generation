    "abstractText": "Background Skeletal muscle is sensitive to bile acids (BA) because it expresses the TGR5 receptor for BA. Cholic (CA) and deoxycholic (DCA) acids induce a sarcopenia\u2010like phenotype through TGR5\u2010dependent mechanisms. Besides, a mouse model of cholestasis\u2010induced sarcopenia was characterised by increased levels of serum BA and muscle weak\u2010 ness, alterations that are dependent on TGR5 expression. Mitochondrial alterations, such as decreased mitochondrial potential and oxygen consumption rate (OCR), increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and unbal\u2010 anced biogenesis and mitophagy, have not been studied in BA\u2010induced sarcopenia. Methods We evaluated the effects of DCA and CA on mitochondrial alterations in C2C12 myotubes and a mouse model of cholestasis\u2010induced sarcopenia. We measured mitochondrial mass by TOM20 levels and mitochondrial DNA; ultrastructural alterations by transmission electronic microscopy; mitochondrial biogenesis by PGC\u20101\u03b1 plasmid reporter activity and protein levels by western blot analysis; mitophagy by the co\u2010localisation of the MitoTracker and LysoTracker fluorescent probes; mitochondrial potential by detecting the TMRE probe signal; protein levels of OXPHOS complexes and LC3B by western blot analysis; OCR by Seahorse measures; and mtROS by MitoSOX probe signals. Results DCA and CA caused a reduction in mitochondrial mass and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis. Interest\u2010 ingly, DCA and CA increased LC3II/LC3I ratio and decreased autophagic flux concordant with raised mitophagosome\u2010 like structures. In addition, DCA and CA decreased mitochondrial potential and reduced protein levels in OXPHOS complexes I and II. The results also demonstrated that DCA and CA decreased basal, ATP\u2010linked, FCCP\u2010induced maxi\u2010 mal respiration and spare OCR. DCA and CA also reduced the number of cristae. In addition, DCA and CA increased the mtROS. In mice with cholestasis\u2010induced sarcopenia, TOM20, OXPHOS complexes I, II and III, and OCR were dimin\u2010 ished. Interestingly, the OCR and OXPHOS complexes were correlated with muscle strength and bile acid levels. Conclusion Our results showed that DCA and CA decreased mitochondrial mass, possibly by reducing mitochon\u2010 drial biogenesis, which affects mitochondrial function, thereby altering potential OCR and mtROS generation.

We measured mitochondrial mass by TOM20 levels and mitochondrial DNA; ultrastructural alterations by transmission electronic microscopy; mitochondrial biogenesis by PGC\u20111\u03b1 plasmid reporter activity and protein levels by western blot analysis; mitophagy by the co\u2011localisation of the MitoTracker and LysoTracker fluorescent probes; mitochondrial potential by detecting the TMRE probe signal; protein levels of OXPHOS complexes and LC3B by western blot analysis; OCR by Seahorse measures; and mtROS by MitoSOX probe signals.\nResults DCA and CA caused a reduction in mitochondrial mass and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis. Interest\u2011 ingly, DCA and CA increased LC3II/LC3I ratio and decreased autophagic flux concordant with raised mitophagosome\u2011 like structures. In addition, DCA and CA decreased mitochondrial potential and reduced protein levels in OXPHOS complexes I and II. The results also demonstrated that DCA and CA decreased basal, ATP\u2011linked, FCCP\u2011induced maxi\u2011 mal respiration and spare OCR. DCA and CA also reduced the number of cristae. In addition, DCA and CA increased the mtROS. In mice with cholestasis\u2011induced sarcopenia, TOM20, OXPHOS complexes I, II and III, and OCR were dimin\u2011 ished. Interestingly, the OCR and OXPHOS complexes were correlated with muscle strength and bile acid levels.\nConclusion Our results showed that DCA and CA decreased mitochondrial mass, possibly by reducing mitochon\u2011 drial biogenesis, which affects mitochondrial function, thereby altering potential OCR and mtROS generation.

            "text": "Sarcopenia is characterised by the loss of muscle mass and decreased muscle function [1, 2]. Among the causes of sarcopenia are immobilisation, sepsis, ageing and chronic disease, such as liver disease [2, 3]. We have recently described that bile acids (BA), cholic (CA) and deoxycholic (DCA) are soluble mediators, the levels of which are increased in chronic liver disease. DCA and CA reduce the diameter of C2C12 myotubes and induce a decrease in myosin heavy-chain protein levels. In addition, the diameters of isolated fibers are reduced by DCA and CA, which are typical features of sarcopenia [4]. This muscle alteration is mediated by the receptor for BA called the TGR5 receptor [4, 5]. Several mechanisms can be involved in muscle alterations, such as decreases in muscle strength and fiber diameter and the diminution of myofibrillar proteins [6, 7], such as unbalanced protein homeostasis, myonuclear apoptosis, oxidative stress, autophagy deregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction [8].\nMitochondria are organelles that are essential for muscle activity. Thus, mitochondria are the primary source of ATP production. They are dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which is used in contractile function [3]. The normal function of mitochondria requires OXPHOS components, such as the mitochondrial I, II, III, IV and V complexes [3]. When OXPHOS components have decreased expression or do not function correctly, mitochondrial dysfunction develops, which is characterised by mitochondrial alterations, such as morphological changes, reduced mass and membrane potential and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) formation [9, 10].\nMitochondria generate new mitochondria through biogenesis and mitochondrial degradation through mitophagy, a specific autophagy pathway for the elimination of mitochondria [11]. A balance between both processes is essential for maintaining mitochondrial content and cellular metabolism [12, 13]. These processes are closely linked to events of mitochondrial dynamics, such as fusion and fission [14\u201316]. Mitochondrial biogenesis is led by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1), a transcriptional coactivator of genes required in several stages of biogenesis, such as Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) [17].\nGenerally, when PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels are increased or post-translationally modified, an increment in mitochondrial biogenesis is observed [18].\nAutophagy is a degradative pathway of cellular components, such as proteins and organelles, through a mechanism that involves lysosomes [19]. The autophagic process consists of the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which are characterised by the presence of microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B) that are post-translationally modified to form LC3II and allow the maturation of autophagosomes. The conversion to an active form of LC3B, represented as the increase in the LC3II/ LC3I ratio, is an autophagy activation marker [19, 20]. Mitophagy is a specific autophagy-dependent mitochondrial degradation in which defective mitochondria are degraded to their essential components via lysosomes. Several mitophagy pathways have been described classically as PINK-1/PARKIN, whereas NIX, BNIP3 and FUNDC are alternative stress pathways [21]. The colocalisation of mitochondria with lysosomes has been used as an index of mitophagy.\nIn the present study, we evaluated the influence of DCA and CA on mitochondrial alterations by detecting mitochondrial mass, potential, bioenergetics, morphology, biogenesis and mitophagy in differentiated C2C12 cells that modelled skeletal muscle myofibers. In addition, we evaluated mitochondrial alterations in skeletal muscle and isolated muscle fiber in a mouse model of cholestasis-induced sarcopenia characterised by elevated plasma levels of BA."

            "text": "mitochondrial structure in\u00a0 C2C12 myotubes The TOM20 protein is constitutively expressed in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and its abundance is related to the amount of mitochondrial mass [22]. We analysed the effects of DCA and CA on mitochondrial mass by detecting mitochondrial protein TOM20 through indirect immunofluorescence in C2C12 myotubes. Figure\u00a01a shows representative images of TOM20 immunodetection. The results of the quantitative analysis showed that the fluorescence intensity of TOM20 decreased by 38 \u00b1 5% (Fig.\u00a01b) and 32 \u00b1 7% (Fig.\u00a01c) after the DCA and CA treatments, respectively. Furthermore, we determined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as another\nparameter of mitochondrial mass. DCA (Fig.\u00a0 1d) and CA (Fig.\u00a0 1e) in C2C12 myotubes decreased the mtDNA content by 35 \u00b1 6% and 22 \u00b1 7%, respectively. In addition, we used a MitoTracker red probe, which consists of a fluorescent dye that enters the mitochondria and is dependent on its potential to target healthy mitochondria (Additional file\u00a0 1a). The results showed that DCA (Additional file\u00a01b) and CA (Additional file\u00a01c) decreased mitochondrial mass (Control = 1.00 \u00b1 0.15; DCA = 0.60 \u00b1 0.18; CA = 0.69 \u00b1 0.11 fold of change).\nTo confirm the decreased mitochondrial mass, we analysed the ultrastructure of mitochondria in C2C12 myotubes treated with DCA and CA using transmission electron microscopy. Figure\u00a01f shows representative images of the experimental groups. As shown in Fig.\u00a01g, h, BA decreased mitochondrial density (Control = 12.90 \u00b1 0.73%; DCA = 10.04 \u00b1 0.35%; CA = 10.10 \u00b1 1.24%) compared with the control group. This result correlated with the decreased mitochondrial mass, as evidenced by the detection of TOM20 (Fig.\u00a0 1). In addition, only CA increased the mitochondrial size (Control = 84.21 \u00b1 7.9\u00a0 nm2; DCA = 86.20 \u00b1 17.35\u00a0 nm2; CA = 135.20 \u00b1 8.2\u00a0 nm2) (Figs.\u00a0 1i, j). However, DCA and CA increased mitochondrial circularity (i.e., width and length), which affected mitochondrial structure (0.70 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.64 \u00b1 0.04 of DCA and CA, respectively), compared with 0.56 \u00b1 0.03 in the control group (Fig.\u00a01k, l). In addition, both BA decreased the mitochondrial cristae number (Control = 0.035 \u00b1 0.003 cristae/nm; DCA = 0.022 \u00b1 0.002 cristae/nm; CA = 0.018 \u00b1 0.003\u00a0 nm2) (Fig.\u00a01m, n). These results indicate that structural alterations could also be conducted to impair mitochondrial activity. Thus, we confirmed alterations in mitochondrial structure, which suggested that mitochondrial machinery could be dysfunctional.\nMitochondria can exhibit either homogenous or punctate morphological patterns, which may indicate changes in their function [23]. The MitoTracker red probe allows for the visualisation of homogeneous or punctate patterns. We used the MitoTracker red probe in C2C12 myotubes treated with DCA and CA to assess\nthe mitochondrial distribution pattern. Additional file\u00a01a shows that the myotubes presented a homogeneous signal under control conditions, whereas DCA and CA induced a punctate pattern. The quantification indicated differences in mitochondrial distribution because there was a more significant number of myotubes with a punctuate pattern in the DCA and CA conditions than in the control condition. DCA increments were 4.3 \u00b1 0.6-fold (Additional file\u00a0 1d), while CA increments were 3.5 \u00b1 0.7-fold (Additional file\u00a01e). These results demonstrated that DCA and CA decreased mitochondrial mass and altered the ultrastructure and distribution patterns of mitochondria."

To evaluate changes in mitochondrial biogenesis that could explain the decrease in mitochondrial mass, we analysed the effects of DCA and CA on PGC-1\u03b1 levels in C2C12 myotubes. First, we determined the effects of these BA on a plasmid reporter containing part of the PGC-1\u03b1 promoter. The results showed that the DCA (Fig.\u00a02a) and CA (Fig.\u00a02b) treatments decreased PGC-1\u03b1 plasmid reporter activity. These results were concordant with PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels evaluated by western blot analysis (Fig.\u00a0 2c). The quantitative analysis showed that DCA (Fig.\u00a02d) and CA (Fig.\u00a02e) decreased PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels (Control = 1.00 \u00b1 0.05; DCA = 0.85 \u00b1 0.03; CA = 0.82 \u00b1 0.06-fold change). Both analyses showed that DCA and CA diminished the expression and protein levels of PGC-1\u03b1, suggesting altered mitochondrial biogenesis.\nAutophagy is a process involved in the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (i.e., mitophagy) by the formation of autophagosomes. Conversion from the cytoplasmic form of the LC3B protein (LC3I) to the autophagosome-incorporated form (LC3II) serves as a marker of autophagosome formation [19, 21]. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of DCA and CA on autophagy\nFig. 1 DCA and CA decrease mitochondrial mass in C2C12 myotubes. Differentiated C2C12 cells forming myotubes were incubated with 120 \u03bcM of DCA or 500 \u03bcM of CA for 72 h. When the treatment was finished, indirect immunofluorescence for TOM20 was performed. a Representative images for TOM20.

In addition, chloroquine treatment blocks fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes by altering the acidic environment of lysosomes and allowing the determination of autophagy flux. Hence, we evaluated the effects of DCA and CA on autophagic flux using chloroquine as a lysosome inhibitor (Fig.\u00a03a). The results showed that DCA (Fig.\u00a03b) and CA (Fig.\u00a03c) increased the LC3II/LC3I ratio by 3.10 \u00b1 0.62 and 2.19 \u00b1 0.61-fold inductions, respectively. The comparison of differences among LC3II protein levels showed that DCA (Fig.\u00a03d) and CA (Fig.\u00a03e) decreased the autophagic flux to 0.44 \u00b1 0.11 and 0.38 \u00b1 0.19-fold, respectively. We used electron microscopy to determine the influence of DCA and CA on the percentage of mitophagosome-like structure accumulation in C2C12 myotubes to confirm the decrease in autophagic flux. Figure\u00a03f shows a representative mitophagosome-like structure. We observed an increase in mitophagosome percentages of DCA (5.61 \u00b1 0.68%) (Fig.\u00a0 3g) and CA (15.35 \u00b1 4.73%) (Fig.\u00a0 3h) compared with the control condition (3.08 \u00b1 0.69%). Mitochondrial mass is determined by a balance between biosynthesis and degradation processes characterised by the participation of different proteins. PINK-1 is a protein associated with mitophagy. Thus, when synthesised, PINK-1 targets mitochondria and is quickly internalised because of the mitochondrial membrane potential and then degraded. However, when mitochondria are damaged, they lose their potential, and the importation of PINK-1 fails, accumulating in the outer membrane of the mitochondria and triggering a series of signals interpreted as damage and favouring recognition by autophagosomes. Therefore, the accumulation of PINK-1 indicates an increase in mitophagy [21]. Hence, we evaluated the effects of DCA and CA on mitophagy in C2C12 myotubes by detecting PINK-1\nlevels as critical markers in the machinery involved in mitophagy (Additional file\u00a02a). The results showed that DCA (Additional file\u00a0 2b) and CA (Additional file\u00a0 2c) decreased PINK-1 protein levels (Control = 1.00 \u00b1 0.06; DCA 0.61 \u00b1 0.15; CA = 0.67 \u00b1 0.11).\nWhen the autophagosomes capture damaged mitochondria, they fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, a structure in which the degradation of this organelle occurs [25]. Therefore, an increase of mitochondria in lysosomes indicates an increase in their degradation. To determine whether DCA and CA treatments affected mitochondria degradation, we determined the co-localisation of mitochondria (labelled with MitoTracker green) with lysosomes (tagged with lysotracker) (Fig.\u00a04a). The Manders\u2019 coefficient indicated that DCA (Fig.\u00a0 4b) and CA (Fig.\u00a0 4c) did not alter the mitochondria or lysosome co-localisation. These results showed that DCA and CA did not increase mitophagy\nin the C2C12 cells. These results indicate that diminished mitochondrial mass induced by DCA and CA may be associated with biogenesis impairment and decreased autophagy flux but not with increasing mitochondrial degradation.\nDCA and\u00a0CA decreased the\u00a0mitochondrial potential, oxygen consumption rate, and\u00a0OXPHOS components in\u00a0 C2C12 myotubes The mitochondrial membrane potential generated by complexes I, III and IV is essential for energy generation [3]. In addition, the mitochondrial membrane potential plays a crucial role in mitochondrial homeostasis because it enables the import of proteins and ions that are essential for the functioning of the mitochondria [26]. Therefore, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential may suggest mitochondrial dysfunction. TMRE is a cationic probe that rapidly enters\nfunctional mitochondria due to its negative charge. However, depolarised or inactive mitochondria that lose their membrane potential fail to sequester this probe. We determined the influence of DCA and CA on mitochondrial potential using the TMRE probe. Figure\u00a05a shows C2C12 myotubes (upper panel) treated with DCA and CA, TMRE signal (middle panel), and zoom (lower panel). The results of the treatment with DCA showed a decreased TMRE signal (Control = 100 \u00b1 12.8; DCA = 44.4 \u00b1 5.7%) (Fig.\u00a0 5b) and CA (Control = 100 \u00b1 12.8; CA = 37 \u00b1 7.7%) (Fig.\u00a05c).\nTo confirm whether alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential affected its functionality in response to DCA and CA, we measured the OCR in C2C12 myotubes using the XF24-3 Seahorse Flux Analyzer, which is a key indicator of mitochondrial oxygen consumption [27]. DCA treatment (Fig.\u00a06a) decreased basal OCR (control = 312.7 \u00b1 43.0 vs DCA = 143.2 \u00b1 37.3\u00a0 pmol/ min/mg). Next, oligomycin, a V complex inhibitor, was added to determine ATP-linked OCR by subtracting the oligomycin rate from the baseline cellular OCR. The DCA treatment decreased ATP-linked OCR (control = 261.7 \u00b1 81.6 vs DCA = 55.3 \u00b1 7.3\u00a0 pmol/min/mg). FCCP was then added to collapse the inner membrane gradient, allowing OXPHOS to work at the maximal rate and the mitochondria to reach their maximal respiratory capacity by subtracting non-mitochondrial respiration from the FFCP rate. DCA reduced maximal respiration induced by FCCP (control = 1,021.4 \u00b1 131.5 vs DCA = 489.6 \u00b1 75.9\u00a0 pmol/min/mg). Mitochondrial spare OCR was calculated by subtracting basal respiration from maximal respiratory capacity. The DCA treatment also reduced spare OCR (control = 655.0 \u00b1 76.2 vs DCA = 349.2 \u00b1 58.6\u00a0 pmol/min/mg) (Fig.\u00a0 6b). As shown in Fig.\u00a0 6b, DCA treatment did not change oligomycininsensitive OCR or proton leakage (subtracting nonmitochondrial respiration from the ATP-linked OCR by oligomycin rate). Figure\u00a06c shows similar results of OCR when the C2C12 myotubes were incubated with CA (basal OCR: control = 312.7 \u00b1 43.0 vs. CA = 195.7 \u00b1 47.9\u00a0 pmol/ min/mg; ATP-linked OCR: control = 261.7 \u00b1 81.6 vs. CA = 81.6 \u00b1 44.4\u00a0 pmol/min/mg; FCCP-induced maximal respiration: control = 1021.4 \u00b1 131.5 vs. CA = 728.1 \u00b1 84.6\u00a0 pmol/min/mg; spare OCR: control = 655.0 \u00b1 76.2 vs. CA = 532.4 \u00b1 36.2\u00a0 pmol/min/mg) (Fig.\u00a0 6d). Similar to the results for DCA, H+-leak OCR was unchanged by the CA treatment (Fig.\u00a06d).\nOne explanation for the loss of mitochondrial potential and functionality was the alteration of the OXPHOS complexes. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of DCA and CA on the protein levels of OXPHOS complexes using western blot analysis (Fig.\u00a06e). The results showed that DCA (Fig.\u00a06f ) and CA (Fig.\u00a06g) decreased OXPHOS\ncomplex I (Control = 1.00 \u00b1 0.28; DCA = 0.54 \u00b1 0.08; CA = 0.30 \u00b1 0.11-fold of change) and complex II (Control = 1.00 \u00b1 0.12; DCA = 0.58 \u00b1 0.09; CA = 0.73 \u00b1 0.03- fold change). The same figures show that in complexes III and V, the DCA and CA treatments did not modify the protein levels.\nThese results showed that DCA and CA decreased mitochondrial function by altering mitochondrialdependent OCR and OXPHOS complexes I and II in C2C12 myotubes."

            "text": "increments in\u00a0 C2C12 myotubes Mitochondrial dysfunction increases the ROS levels produced by this organelle, contributing to exacerbated functional alterations [28]. In this context, the MitoSOX Red probe corresponded to a stain incorporated into mitochondria and, in response to oxidation, fluoresces and indicates mtROS levels. To assess whether DCA and CA could increase mtROS, we used flow cytometry to evaluate whether they affected mtROS levels by detecting the MitoSOX fluorescent signal in C2C12 myotubes. Figure\u00a07a shows a dot plot of the MitoSOX fluorescent signal, which increased with the DCA and CA treatments. Specifically, the MitoSOX fluorescent signal increased 1.77-fold in DCA (Fig.\u00a0 7b) (DCA: 0.00519 \u00b1 0.00029 vs Ctrl: 0.001985 \u00b1 0.000381) and 1.42-fold in CA (Fig.\u00a0 7c) with respect to the Control (CA: 0.002820 \u00b1 0.000438 vs Ctrl: 0.001985 \u00b1 0.000381).\nFurthermore, MitoSOX-associated mtROS were evaluated using fluorescence microscopy. Figure\u00a0 7d shows that the MitoSOX signal increased in the DCA and CA treatments. The results showed that the MitoSOX-associated mtROS increment induced by DCA (Fig.\u00a07e) and CA (Fig.\u00a07f ) was 2.8 \u00b1 0.9- and 3.1 \u00b1 0.4-fold of induction, respectively. These results indicate that DCA and CA increase mtROS in C2C12 myotubes.\nMitochondrial alterations correlate with\u00a0strength and\u00a0bile acids in\u00a0mice with\u00a0cholestasis\u2011induced sarcopenia We previously described a mouse model of cholestasisinduced sarcopenia induced by hepatotoxin (DDC) intake [29]. This model is characterised by decreased muscle strength (Additional file\u00a03a) and increased plasma levels of BA, including DCA and CA (Additional file\u00a03b) [29]. These parameters showed an inverse correlation (Pearson coefficient = \u2212\u00a0 0.86; p < 0.001) (Additional file\u00a0 3c). In sarcopenia, fast-twitch muscles are the primary muscles affected compared with slow-twitch muscles. Thus, we utilised two fast muscles, Tibialis anterior (TA) and Extensor digitorum longus (EDL), to determine whether mitochondrial parameters were altered in this model [30\u201332]. To describe the mitochondrial mass and\nfunction and correlate them with muscle function and BA levels, we applied western blot analysis to measure TOM20 and OXPHOX complex protein levels in skeletal muscle in mice fed a standard (Chow) or DDC-supplemented diet (DDC). As shown in Figs.\u00a08a, b, TOM20 levels (DDC = 0.306 \u00b1 0.086-fold of change) decreased in TA muscle from DDC-fed mice compared with the chow group (Chow = 1.000 \u00b1 0.0579-fold of change). This result indicated that mitochondrial mass decreased in the sarcopenic muscles of the cholestatic mice.\nWe then applied western blot analysis to evaluate the effects of DDC diet-induced cholestasis on the protein levels of the OXPHOS complexes (Fig.\u00a0 8c). The results (Fig.\u00a0 8d) indicated that DDC decreased OXPHOS complexes I, II and III by 83.5 \u00b1 12.5, 77.6 \u00b1 10.4, and 46.1 \u00b1 24%, respectively, compared with the TA muscle chow group. The same figures show that the protein levels in complexes IV and V were unmodified under the DDC diet.\nTo evaluate whether alterations in mitochondrial mass and OXPHOS complexes affected mitochondrial function, we determined OCR in EDL muscle fibers isolated from mice fed chow and DDC diets. Figure\u00a08e shows that the DDC diet decreased basal OCR (chow = 105.5 \u00b1 4.1 vs DDC = 68.4 \u00b1 3.6\u00a0 pmol/min/mg), ATP-linked OCR (chow = 89.4 \u00b1 8.8 vs DDC = 37.2 \u00b1 1.0\u00a0 pmol/min/ mg), and the maximal respiration induced by FCCP (chow = 226.1 \u00b1 31 vs DDC = 172.4 \u00b1 1.5\u00a0 pmol/min/mg) in EDL muscle fibers.\nWe also evaluated potential correlations between muscle strength, BA levels, OCR and OXPHOS complexes. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 8f, a positive correlation was found between muscle strength and OCR basal (Pearson coefficient = 0.73; p < 0.05), ATP-linked OCR (Pearson coefficient = 0.89; p < 0.001), and OXPHOS complexes I (Pearson coefficient = 0.96; p < 0.01), II (Pearson coefficient = 0.95; p < 0.05) and III (Pearson coefficient = 0.90; p < 0.05). Figure\u00a08f also shows that an inverse correlation was found between BA levels and OCR basal (Pearson coefficient = -0.81; p < 0.05), ATP-linked OCR (Pearson coefficient = -0.91; p < 0.001), and OXPHOS complexes I (Pearson coefficient = -0.98; p < 0.001), II (Pearson coefficient = \u2212\u00a0 0.95; p < 0.05) and III (Pearson coefficient = \u2212\u00a00.89; p < 0.05)."

            "text": "In the present study, we evaluated the effects of two BA\u2014 DCA and CA\u2014on mitochondrial mass and function, biogenesis, mitophagy, autophagic flux and ultrastructure. The results showed that DCA and CA decreased mitochondrial mass, which was determined by TOM20 levels, MitoTracker red intensity, mtDNA content, and mitochondrial density. The results also showed decreased\nfunction, measured by reduced OCR and potential, as well as increased mtROS levels and ultrastructural alterations, measured by increased circularity and decreased cristae numbers. In addition, the results showed that DCA and CA decreased the autophagic flux concomitantly with the accumulation of mitophagosome-like structures. The results also indicated that DCA and CA decreased mitochondrial biogenesis but did not provide evidence of changes in mitophagy. Interestingly, the mice with cholestasis-induced sarcopenia had decreased TOM20, OXPHOS complexes I, II and III, and OCR. In addition, the OCR and OXPHOS complexes were correlated with muscle strength and BA levels.\nThe decrease in mitochondrial mass caused by DCA and CA incubation can be explained by changes in mitochondrial biogenesis induced by these BA. The differences observed in PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels support this finding. Moreover, the decrease in PGC-1 \u03b1 promotor activity suggests that the participation of regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional level is induced by DCA and CA, which affects mitochondrial biogenesis. However, our results contradict those of previous studies in the literature. In endothelial cells, taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) increased PGC-1\u03b1 levels and activity, which translated into an improved mitochondrial function [33]. INT677, an agonist of farnesoid and TGR5, both receptors for BA, induced mitochondrial biogenesis in fat tissue [34]. In addition, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) promoted mitochondrial biogenesis in the livers of obese mice [35]. However, our results showed impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, possibly due to a tissue-specific mechanism in skeletal muscle. In this context, we must consider that skeletal muscle has two populations of mitochondria, subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IMF), which differ according to their subcellular localisation, morphology and biochemical properties [36\u201338]. The existence of organellar heterogeneity has enabled determining the differential responses of IMF and SS to conditions such as the regulation of fatty acid metabolism or under conditions of disuse or exercise [39\u201341]. The differential responses of the two mitochondrial subfractions and the differential import of mitochondrial proteins to these fractions [42] imply a potential heterogeneous regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis influenced by nuclear domains or extracellular signals, such as BA [43]. In this context, it has been described that the cell response to high BA levels induces cell death by apoptosis, a process dependent on mitochondria, in hepatocytes [44]. However, skeletal muscle in a cholestatic condition with high BA levels shows increases in some markers of apoptosis without producing the death of muscle fiber [45]. This event could be explained by\nthe differential responses of IMF and SS mitochondria in muscles exposed to BA.\nAnother explanation for the discrepancy in our results between mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle cells and other cell types is the metabolic context in which BA can act. Regarding endothelial cells in which BA increased mitochondrial biogenesis, experiments were conducted in obese and diabetic contexts, and the results showed that BA had beneficial effects. It has been demonstrated that BA, administered via the intestine, indirectly improved insulin resistance through the secretion of GLP-1 and insulin, with the participation of gut microbiota [46]. In the present study, the mice were not obese or diabetic. The increased BA levels in plasma generated sarcopenia in the skeletal muscle [4, 29], altering the mass and function of mitochondria and showing decreased mitochondrial biogenesis.\nCombined with mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy establishes a balance that preserves mitochondrial homeostasis. Interestingly, the decreased mitochondrial mass induced by DCA and CA did not involve changes in mitophagy. The evidence is sufficient to link biogenesis, mitophagy and the balance between them. The mTOR signaling pathway is typically involved in this relationship [47]. Another mediator engaged in sensing energy expenditure with consequences for mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitophagy is AMPK [48]. Previous results have shown that mitochondrial dynamics, such as fission, are linked with biogenesis and mitophagy. This relationship has been described as a mechanism that involves a distinctive signature of fission (peripherical or middle) associated with inducing biogenesis or mitophagy [49].\nThe changes observed in mitochondrial mass can be translated into functionality. Our results showed that DCA and CA generated mitochondrial dysfunction. Antecedents in aged muscle cells indicate that the reduction in mitochondrial function could be caused by a decrease in mitochondrial volume, an increase in oxidative stress, an accumulation of mutations in mtDNA, and/or altered mitochondrial morphology [50]]. Our results showed that DCA and CA produced decreased potential and OCR, which are indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. These features are also related to changes in the OXPHOS components, such as I and II complexes. Similarly, we found that DCA and CA increased circularity and decreased the cristae number, two parameters associated with mitochondrial malfunction. We observed increased size and circularity, which could indicate mitochondrial fusion and the presence of damaged mitochondria. Mitochondria form a highly dynamic and interconnected network in skeletal muscle [51]. Our results showed a possible disruption of the mitochondrial network in the presence of DCA and CA, changing from\na homogeneous network to a punctate pattern. Thus, these findings suggest that both BAs produce decreased mitochondrial mass and dysfunction of the mitochondrial pool, which are probably associated with ATP production and mtROS.\nWe previously demonstrated that DCA and CA induced oxidative damage in myotubes and muscle fibers [4]. In the present study, we found that DCA and CA increased mtROS levels, which likely contributed to the development of oxidative stress in muscle cells. In this context, the depletion of antioxidant mechanisms could also be associated with increased oxidative stress in skeletal muscle cells treated with DCA and CA. DCA diminishes mRNA and levels of antioxidant mitochondrial protein peroxiredoxin in trophoblast cells. The knockdown of this family of peroxidase enzymes resembles the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by BA [52]. In addition, mitochondrial alterations in bioenergetics activity and ETC could be associated with the alteration of electron transport within this organelle, consequently favouring the accumulation of mtROS and causing elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress. However, further analysis must be conducted to determine the reason for the increased mtROS induced by DCA and CA in myotubes.\nWhen these results are contextualised under pathological conditions, such as cholestasis-induced sarcopenia, it is plausible that mitochondrial dysfunction could be a mechanism involved in muscle alterations, which we observed in a murine model of cholestasis-induced sarcopenia [29, 53]. The present study also showed decreased OCR and OXPHOS complexes I, II and III in mice with cholestasis-induced sarcopenia. These findings are directly correlated with muscle strength but inversely correlated with BA levels, which supports our previous findings that BA-induced sarcopenic-like phenotype [4], suggesting that BA could be a soluble signal that negatively communicates the liver and muscle during cholestasis, thus generating muscle atrophy, weakness and energetic imbalance leading to sarcopenia. Nonetheless, it is essential to note that the effects found in this study were limited to fast-twitch muscles, which raises the question of what might occur in slow-twitch muscles. Based on the literature, a differential effect could be expected because slow fibers have high resistance to mitochondrial alterations. For example, they have a much more resistant mtROS scavenger system, which slows the progression of mitochondrial alterations [54].\nIn our study, a relevant finding was that DCA and CA treatments induced an increased LC3II/LC3I ratio but a decreased autophagic flux, indicating that DCA and CA caused lysosomal-dependent degradation that was lower than the basal condition. This result was reinforced\nby the accumulation of mitophagosome-like structures induced by the DCA and CA treatments. In the context of our study, these results could suggest that under cholestatic conditions with high BA levels, there are fewer mitochondria that present malfunction and could follow the mitophagy pathway because they are arrested in the mitophagosome formation. At the mechanistic level, the antecedents explain our results of decreased autophagic flux. Thus, BA can alter autophagic degradation by impairing autophagosomal\u2013lysosomal fusion, which is likely due to the reduction in adaptor proteins, such as Rab7, targeting it to autophagosomes [55]. In addition, the lower lysosomal-dependent degradation of autophagosomes aligned with the unchanged mitophagy observed under the DCA and CA treatments.\nInterestingly, oxidative stress is linked to alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, fission and fusion [47]. Thus, the contribution of mtROS to oxidative stress in skeletal muscle under exposure to BA could explain the decreased biogenesis and alterations in autophagic\nflux found in the present study. These results suggest the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria with reduced ATP generation, supported by the reduction in the ATP-linked OCR and respiratory complexes I and II, which could be a central factor in the loss of strength and changes in fiber types observed in BA-induced sarcopenia or cholestatic liver disease [4, 29, 53]."
