Exploring the Functional Properties of Deamidated Pea Protein in Food Applications: Given the improved solubility and thermal stability of deamidated pea protein isolates (DPPI), future research could focus on the application of DPPI in a variety of food products. Studies could be designed to evaluate the sensory, textural, and nutritional qualities of food items, such as plant-based beverages, gels, and emulsions, incorporating DPPI. This would provide a practical understanding of how DPPI can be used to enhance the quality of plant-based food products.

Comparative Analysis of Deamidation Methods: While this study employed enzymatic deamidation using protein glutaminase, future research could compare the efficacy and outcomes of different deamidation methods, including chemical and physical approaches. Such studies would provide insights into the advantages, limitations, and application potentials of each method, helping to optimize the deamidation process for specific functional properties or applications.

Investigation of Other Plant Proteins: Given the positive results with pea protein, similar deamidation strategies could be applied to other plant proteins, such as lentil, chickpea, and rice proteins. Comparative studies could help identify the most suitable plant proteins for deamidation, expanding the range of functional plant proteins available for food formulation and addressing issues like allergenicity and sustainability in the food industry.

Molecular Mechanism Behind Deamidation Effects: While the study provided insights into the structural changes induced by deamidation, deeper molecular-level investigations could elucidate the precise mechanisms through which deamidation improves protein functionality. Advanced molecular biology and protein chemistry techniques could be used to explore the interactions between deamidated proteins and other food components, as well as the impact of deamidation on protein digestibility and nutritional value.

Scale-Up and Industrial Feasibility Studies: Research into the scalability of the enzymatic deamidation process and its economic feasibility for industrial applications would be valuable. This includes assessing the cost-effectiveness of enzyme production and usage, the impact of deamidation on the overall protein yield and quality, and the integration of the deamidation process into existing plant protein production lines. Such studies would help translate laboratory findings into commercially viable processes, potentially leading to broader adoption of deamidated plant proteins in the food industry.
