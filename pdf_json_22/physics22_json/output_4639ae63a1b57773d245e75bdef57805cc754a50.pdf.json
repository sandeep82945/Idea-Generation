    "abstractText": "In this paper we describe the performance of a prototype of the High Angle Time Projection Chambers (HA-TPCs) that are being produced for the Near Detector (ND280) upgrade of the T2K experiment. The two HATPCs of ND280 will be instrumented with eight Encapsulated Resistive Anode Micromegas (ERAM) on each endplate, for a total of 32 ERAMs. This innovative technique allows the detection of the charge emitted by ionization electrons over several pads, improving the determination of the track position. The TPC prototype has been equipped with the first ERAM module produced for T2K and with the HA-TPC readout electronics chain and it has been exposed to an electron beam at DESY in order to measure spatial and dE/dx resolution. In this paper we characterize the performances of the ERAM and, for the first time, we compare them with a newly developed simulation of the detector response. Spatial resolution better than 800 \u03bcm and dE/dx resolution better than 10% are observed for all the incident angles and for all the drift distances of interest. All the main features of the data are correctly reproduced by the simulation and these performances fully fulfill the requirements for the HA-TPCs of T2K.",

            "text": "T2K (\u201cTokai-to-Kamioka\u201d) [1] is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment situated in Japan that has been taking data since 2010. By using an intense muon neutrino beam produced at the J-PARC accelerator complex and searching for the appearance of electron neutrinos at the far detector, Super-Kamiokande, T2K provided the first observation of muon to electron neutrino oscillations [2, 3]. Recently first hints of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in the leptonic sector were also published by T2K [4].\nIn order to confirm these hints, T2K is now preparing the second phase of the experiment, that includes an upgrade of the neutrino beamline [5] and of the off-axis Near Detector complex, ND280 [6]. The ND280 is a multi-purpose detector with several sub-detectors installed inside the UA1/NOMAD magnet that provides a magnetic field of 0.2 T. The core of ND280 is a tracker system, composed by two Fine Grained Detectors (FGDs) [7] and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) [8] instrumented with Bulk Micromegas modules [9]. The TPCs are used to track charged particles emitted in neutrino interactions and to measure their charges and momenta as well as to perform particle identification based on the ionization energy losses in the gas. The ND280 has been extensively used in all T2K oscillation analyses and it allows for a reduction of systematic uncertainties to the level of 4\u20135% [10]. These uncertainties mostly come from our limited knowledge of neutrino interactions with nuclei, and of the neutrino beam properties (energy spectrum and composition).\nAn upgrade of ND280 is being constructed [11], with the goal of further reducing these systematic uncertainties [12]. It consists in replacing one of\nthe ND280 sub-detectors, the \u03c00 detector (P0D) [13], with a new tracker system composed by a 3-dimensional scintillator target (Super-FGD) [14], made of \u223c2 millions scintillator cubes of 1 cm3, each readout by three wavelength shifting fibers, two High Angle TPCs (HA-TPCs) and six Time-OfFlight (TOF) planes [15]. This upgrade will be installed at J-PARC in 2023. Among other improvements, the presence of the HA-TPCs will increase the reconstruction efficiency for the tracks produced in neutrino (antineutrino) interactions with nuclei, emitted at large angle or in backward direction with respect to the incoming neutrino. The main goals of the two new HA-TPCs are reconstruction of charged particles trajectories, measurements of their momenta and particle identification. These goals require a good spatial resolution and a precise ionization energy loss measurement.\nEach endplate of the HA-TPC will be instrumented with 8 Encapsulated Resistive Anode Micromegas (ERAM) [16]. The first ERAM detector produced for ND280 upgrade was initially tested using an X-ray test bench at CERN and then mounted on a prototype of the field cages that are being constructed for the HA-TPCs. This field cage prototype has the same construction materials, the same drift length and the same strip foils configuration to produce a uniform electric field as the cages that are being constructed for the ND280 upgrade. Also, the front-end electronics chain that will be used for the HA-TPCs, including two Front-End-Cards (FECs) each hosting eight Asic For TPC Electronic Readout (AFTER) chips [17], and one Front-End-Mezzanine (FEM), all equipped with their cooling plates, was mounted on the field cage. The FEM was connected to a Trigger and Data Concentrator Module (TDCM) [18] used for the data transfer to a DAQ\ncomputer via a Modular Interactive Data Acquisition System (MIDAS) [19] front-end.\nThe TPC prototype was placed at the DESY T24/1 facility [20] inside a large-bore superconducting solenoid, called PCMAG, that provides a magnetic field of intensity up to 1.25 T and it was exposed to a beam of electrons with momenta between 1 and 4 GeV/c, see Fig.1. As we will show in this paper, this test beam campaign allowed us to validate the performances of the TPCs for tracks with different incident angles with respect to the ERAM detector and for all the drift distances of interest for the T2K TPCs.\nThis paper uses similar methods as those described in Refs. [21, 22] to analyze the test beam data. The main novelty of this paper is that the data are also compared with a simulation that has been developed by using the ND280 software [1], adding the HA-TPCs ERAM geometry and the features of the resistive layers and of the AFTER chip electronics response.\nAs it will be shown in the rest of this paper, the ERAM detector allows to reach a spatial resolution better than 800 \u00b5m for all the incident angles and\ndrift distances, and a dE/dx resolution better than 10% for tracks crossing the entire ERAM module. These performances are in good agreement with the ones predicted by the simulation that is able to reproduce low level variables, such as the charge sharing between neighboring pads or their time difference, as well as the spatial and the dE/dx resolution.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the ERAM technology and its use for the HA-TPC prototype. Section 3 presents the experimental setup. The simulation of the ERAM response is described in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to the characterization of the ERAM detector. The data collected during the DESY test beam are presented in Section 6, while Section 7 provides a description of reconstruction algorithms. Section 8 is devoted to a comparison of ERAM response between data and simulation. Spatial and dE/dx resolutions are presented in Sections 9 and 10, respectively, while Section 11 discusses a comparison between the data and the simulation. A study of the E\u00d7B effect is presented in Section 12. A short discussion on further potential improvements is given in Section 13. The conclusions in Section 14 close the paper."

            "text": "The ERAM technology, initially developed for the ILC prototypes [23], allows the spreading of the charge induced on the \u201cleading\u201d pad by the electrons, produced from ionization, over several adjacent \u201cneighbour\u201d pads. The signal produced by the charge deposited in each pad (or \u201cwaveform\u201d) is a function of time and it can be predicted. The combination of the information from these signals on different pads forming a \u201ccluster\u201d allows us to\nimprove the spatial resolution and hence the determination of the momentum of charged particles. Different ERAM prototypes have been tested at CERN [21] and at DESY [22] to characterize the ERAM response.\nThroughout this paper we define \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d tracks as tracks along the horizontal (X-axis in the local ERAM reference frame) and vertical (Y-axis in the local ERAM reference frame) pad border of ERAM respectively (see Fig. 2). \u201cInclined\u201d tracks are the tracks tilted in the XY plane. Thanks to the PCMAG movable stage we could move the TPC prototype, performing scans of the ERAM in Y and X (rotating the prototype by 90\u25e6) directions as well as scans in Z (drift distance). The global reference frame is provided in Fig. 1.\nIn this paper, for track reconstruction we use a method similar to the one already implemented for the analysis of previous test beam periods at CERN [21] and at DESY [22]. This reconstruction method is based on the maximal amplitudes of the waveforms in the pads constituting the clusters.\nClusters of pads are built to be transverse to the track projections on the detection plane, following the ERAM columns (rows) for horizontal (vertical) tracks or their diagonals for inclined tracks, see Figs. 4 and 6 in [22]. For each cluster, composed of multiple pads, a track position is reconstructed. The spatial resolution refers to the accuracy of the measured position in the cluster with respect to the reconstructed track position. Studies are underway aiming at using simultaneously the full information of the waveforms of all the pads around the tracks in a global fit, to improve the track reconstruction accuracy. A more simple approach used here is a robust reference for further studies, and can already show that the detector performances meet the physics requirements of the experiment. The results of this test beam campaign allowed us to validate the ERAM design and start the production of the 32 ERAMs that will be used to instrument the HA-TPCs.\nThe large drift distance available in the TPC prototype under test, which is similar to the one of the final HA-TPC, is crucial to validate our understanding of two important effects: a \u201ccharge sharing\u201d between pads induced by the diffusion in the gas and a \u201ccharge spreading\u201d due to the ERAM resistive foil. Contrary to the \u201ccharge sharing\u201d effect, the signals in neighbouring pads are delayed compared to the one of the leading pad in case of the \u201ccharge spreading\u201d.\nThe impact of these effects will be discussed after a detailed presentation\nof the obtained results."

This new design minimizes the dead space and maximizes the tracking volume by reducing the distance between the outer TPC wall and the active gas volume from 12 cm to 4 cm. The radiation length of the material composing the field cage is 2%. The used gas composition is the standard T2K gas [24], a mixture of Ar:CF4:iC4H10 (95:3:2).\nIn order to test the construction process of the HA-TPCs field cages, several prototypes have been produced. One of them, that shares all the characteristics of the final field cages, was used for the test beam described in this paper.\nThe field cage prototype is built with lightweight and low-Z mechanical structures with a hollow shell shape constituting the box. The box is laminated on an Aluminum mold in several layers, namely Kapton\u00ae sheets, aramide fiber-fabrics peels and honeycomb spacer panels glued together. The field cage is then enclosed on two sides with a cathode plane and the anode where the ERAM detector is located.\nThe innermost cage wall surface embeds a double layer of thin copper strips: the field strips for degrading the potential from the cathode to the anode and the mirror strips on the opposite side, for regularizing the field nearby the walls and for mitigating the effects of free charge deposition on\ndielectric surfaces. The strip foils are produced by the CERN Micro-Pattern Technologies service. In order to protect the field cage from the possible presence of tiny carbon fibers embedded into the aramide fiber fabric (Twaron) the mirror strip side is protected with an additional Kapton\u00ae coverlay glued on it.\nThe prototype has the same drift length (97.25 cm) as the HA-TPCs and a reduced transverse area (42 \u00d7 42 cm2) suitable to host one ERAM module. It was produced by the NEXUS company (Barcelona, Spain) and the different phases of the production of the prototype are shown in Fig. 3.\nPrior to exposing the prototype to the electron beam at DESY, an extensive characterization of the field cage has been done at CERN. The properties were extremely good concerning fiberglass flanges smoothness quality,\ngas tightness (measured leakage below 0.1 l/h), inner surface quality and deformations smaller than 0.2 mm, compatible with prototype mold tolerances. We also performed several measurements of resistance and capacitance on the field and mirror strips showing that the electric field is behaving as expected."

            "text": "A description of the ERAM technology and of the detector used for the HA-TPCs of T2K is given in [22]. The ERAM modules built for T2K have a size of 42\u00d7 34 cm2 and are segmented in 36\u00d7 32 rectangular pads of size 11.18\u00d7 10.09 mm2.\nThe ERAMs are used to readout the ionization electrons produced by charged particles crossing the TPC gas volume. These electrons are drifted to the anode readout plane of the TPC under a uniform electric field. On the readout plane, an avalanche is generated by a high electric field in the ERAM amplification region. The resulting pattern of illuminated pads corresponds to the trajectory of the track.\nThe main difference between the bulk-Micromegas technology used for the existing ND280 TPCs and an ERAM is that, in the case of bulk-Micromegas and for short drift distances the position reconstruction is limited by the pad size that is large compared to the size of the avalanche which falls on a metallic anode. In the ERAM, instead, the anode is covered by a foil of insulating material with a thin resistive layer on top, inducing signals over several pads. This allows a better reconstruction of the position of the charged particles crossing the TPC.\nThe ERAM detector uses a Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) thin layer sputtered on a 50 \u00b5m thick APICAL\u00ae (Kapton\u00ae) insulator sheet. The detector\ninstalled on the field cage, named ERAM-01, has a resistivity of 300\u2013400 kOhm/ using DLC foils stack on a 150 \u00b5m glue layer."

One of the goals of the test beam campaign was to validate the HATPC front-end electronics performance when placed inside a 0.2 T magnetic field. It has been then proved that their behavior is not altered.\nThe HA-TPC electronics, shown in Fig. 4, is based on the use of the AFTER chips [17], that had been designed for the existing ND280 vertical TPCs. The AFTER chip is a 72-channel ASIC that includes preamplifiers and shapers with programmable gain and peaking time coupled to a 511-time bucket switched capacitor array (SCA). During the test beam the electronics peaking time was set to either 200 or 412 ns.\nThe FECs have been newly designed and host 8 AFTER chips. They are installed parallel to the ERAM modules and two FECs are used to readout one ERAM (1152 channels). The response linearity of the FEC has been measured with a dedicated campaign and showed a uniform response of all the channels with typical differences in linearity among neighboring pads smaller than 2%. The two FECs on each ERAM are connected to a FEM card that performs their control, synchronization and data aggregation.

For our case, ERAM is expected to have an RC within 50-120 ns/mm2.

(4)\nWhen considering an avalanche of electrons, the waveforms induced in each pad by each electron of the avalanche should be computed taking into account the arrival time of each of them and summed in order to obtain the complete waveform (WF) of the avalanche.\nTherefore, the numerical evaluation of the diffusion equation solution and\nof the convolution is extremely heavy in terms of computation time. To keep the simulation to a reasonable time some approximations were included as described below.\nThe first method is related to reducing the total number of avalanches to be simulated. The pad is divided into several smaller sub-pad regions e.g. 3\u00d73 or 5\u00d75. All the avalanches that are detected in the same sub-pad are merged into one and the charge Q is computed for the sum of all the contributions in this sub-pad.\nThe next and most significant optimization is related to the pre-computation\nof the diffusion equation solution and convolution (as in Eq. 4). Before starting the simulation the detector response is pre-computed for a unit charge, a given RC that is input to the model, and for all the positions across a 2D grid in the pad, Qunit(RC, xi, yi, t), where xi and yi are the coordinates of a sub-pad center. The step of the grid can be tuned and for this work we divided the pad in a grid of 10\u00d710 sub-pad regions. The obtained distributions are convoluted with the derivative of the electronics response to get the waveform (WFunit) for a unit charge. The final waveform WF(t) can be easily obtained by scaling the pre-computed solution WFunit with the total charge Qi in each sub-pad i, so that:\nWF (t) = \u2211 i Qi \u00d7WFunit(xi, yi)(t). (5)\nThe main approximation in this computation is the assumption that all the electrons in a sub-pad arrive at the center of this sub-pad. This implies that no numerical computations are needed during the simulation.\nThe described optimization methods reduce the required CPU time by\nmore than two orders of magnitude without noticeable impacts on the simulation output.\nTwo examples of the WF, one for the data and one for the simulation, are shown in Fig. 5 for the leading and for two neighboring pads. Here and in the following of this paper, the leading pad is defined as the pad with the largest maximum of the waveform while neighboring pads are the ones adjacent to the leading pad in the direction perpendicular to the track projection on the ERAM plane (see discussion on clustering algorithms in Sect. 7)."

In order to be selected, a track needs to cross the whole detector. Due to a large number of pads per cluster (multiplicity) induced by the resisitive layer, two close parallel tracks may not be separated by a gap and thus can be mis-reconstructed as one single track.\nTo reject such a topology and also to remove superimposed tracks, a cut on the mean multiplicity of the track is applied. This cut depends on the track clustering algorithm that is used to reconstruct the tracks. As it was introduced in [22], we use horizontal and vertical clustering for tracks with the angles of inclination w.r.t. the ERAM plane below 30 degrees and above 60 degrees respectively, while for inclined tracks we use a diagonal clustering algorithm in which pads are combined into clusters according to their diagonal.\nThe mean multiplicity depends on the reconstruction algorithm and on the peaking time for the electronics. It is shown in Fig. 7 for horizontal and inclined tracks at various drift distances and peaking times.\nFor the analyses presented in this paper, we select tracks with mean multiplicity comprised between 2.4 and 3.2 (1.5 and 2.2) for horizontal (inclined) tracks with 200 ns peaking time. For 412 ns peaking time only horizontal\ntracks were taken and, for this sample, we required a mean multiplicity comprised between 2.7 and 3.6.\nFinally, to avoid edge effects, the pads at the border are excluded from the reconstruction and hence horizontal tracks have 34 clusters while vertical tracks have 30."

For this analysis, the spatial resolution is determined by employing a PRF method in the same manner as in [21, 22].\nIn this method we define, for each cluster, the residual as the difference between the position of the track reconstructed locally (i.e. in one cluster) and the fitted track position. The distribution of the residuals in each cluster is fitted with a Gaussian and its width represents the spatial resolution.\nThe measurement of the track position is performed with an iterative procedure. For the first step, track position in the clusters is reconstructed using the charge barycentric method. Such a method estimates the position of the track in a certain cluster by weighting the centre of the pad position by the charge in this pad. The estimated primary track positions in each cluster are then fit with a parabola over the whole detector (global fit). Based on the results of the fit, a pad response function scatter plot is filled for each pad. The PRF function is defined as:\nPRF (xtrack \u2212 xpad) = Qpad/Qcluster (6)\nwhere xtrack and xpad are positions of the track from the global fit and the center of the pad, respectively, and Qpad and Qcluster are charges collected by the pad and by the whole cluster.\nThe PRF scatter plot is fitted with a ratio of two polynomials (the same as in [22, 32]). The scatter plot and the parametrization of the PRF are done independently for samples at different drift distances and inclinations. The estimated parameters of the PRF analytical function are used further in the \u03c72 minimization procedure to estimate the track position in each cluster with:\n\u03c72 = \u2211 pads ( Qpad/Qcluster \u2212 PRF (xtrack \u2212 xpad) \u03c3Qpad/Qcluster )2 (7)\nwhere \u03c3Qpad/Qcluster = \u221a Qpad/Qcluster. In the following iterations the track position is evaluated from the fit. The iterative procedure is repeated while the spatial resolution keeps improving and it typically converges after three iterations. Examples of PRF for horizontal and inclined tracks are shown in Fig. 9.\nThe spatial resolution is defined as the width of the residual distribution for each cluster. Examples for horizontal and inclined tracks are shown in Fig. 10. The distribution is expected to be centered at zero and differences with respect to zero are the biases that will be discussed in Sect. 9.3.\nAs an external cross-check of the performance of tracking algorithm, typical distributions of reconstructed track positions for incoming electron beam\nare shown in Fig. 11."

The observed dependence is in agreement with this prediction. The peaking time mildly affects the C2diff/Neff term, but changes the \u03c30. A larger peaking time results in a higher amplitude in the neighbour pads and higher pad multiplicity. Thus we have more robust information for the PRF fit and the track position reconstruction is more precise.\nThe spatial resolution can also depend on the ERAM module characteristics, such as its gain and the local RC value. To investigate these possible dependencies we used a scan done at fixed drift distance but with horizontal tracks crossing the ERAM at different Y positions and (after rotation by 90\u25e6) vertical tracks crossing the ERAM at different X positions. The spatial resolution obtained for these different X and Y positions is shown in Fig. 13. No large differences are observed indicating that possible local non-uniformities on the ERAM module do not affect the spatial resolution.

In [22] it has been shown that the use of a diagonal clustering for highly inclined tracks significantly improves the spatial resolution with respect to the use of horizontal or vertical clustering.\nFig. 14 (a) demonstrates that, while the spatial resolution depends on the angle, it stays between 200 and 800 \u00b5m for all the analyzed samples. In particular, it is interesting to notice in Fig. 14 (b) that, while the spatial resolution degrades with the drift distance for horizontal and vertical tracks, it is constant for inclined tracks.\nThe behavior for diagonal tracks can be understood considering that the spatial resolution depends on the charge spread over a certain amount of pads (multiplicity). A diagonal clustering algorithm leads to a smaller mean multiplicity than in the case of horizontal/vertical clustering as it was shown in Fig. 7. With the diagonal clustering pad size becomes effectively \u221a 2 times larger, thus degrading the spatial resolution but also making the effect of the transverse diffusion less significant.\nMoreover, diagonal clustering implies a dependence of the resolution on the length of the track in the cluster. This causes an oscillatory behav-\nior in the spatial resolution versus the cluster that is shown in Fig. 15 (a). Fig. 15 (b) shows the dependence of the spatial resolution on the track length per cluster for inclined tracks.

In this figure, the bias is defined as the mean of the absolute values\nof the biases per cluster. It is observed that biases are larger at short and long drift distances than at distances corresponding to the middle of the drift volume.\nFor inclined tracks, instead, as shown in Fig. 16 (b), the biases do not depend on the drift distance or on the \u03c6 angle of the tracks reconstructed using diagonal clustering.\nIn order to further investigate the behavior observed in Fig. 16, the dependence of the spatial resolution and bias per column on the drift distance is shown in Fig. 17.

The TPC particle identification capability will depend on the dE/dx resolution that can be evaluated with the data from this test beam. The dE/dx was measured for horizontal and vertical tracks using the track projection on the pad side.\nFor inclined tracks reconstructed with diagonal clustering the deposited energy was corrected for the track segment length in each cluster. Such correction accounts for the non-linear dependence of the charge with respect to the track length caused by the charge contribution from the neighbouring\nclusters for short track lengths. This procedure was described in [22].\nIn the context of T2K it is particularly important to be able to distinguish electrons and muons. Such an effort is crucial to estimate electron neutrino contamination in the muon neutrino beam and to predict the expected number of un-oscillated electron neutrinos in the far detector. To distinguish electrons and muons the deposited energy resolution better than 10% is needed in order to achieve a separation between electrons and muons higher than 3 sigma.\nThe mean deposited energy per unit track length is calculated per track using the truncated mean method already introduced in [22]. The method consists in sorting the clusters according to their dE/dx and removing a fraction of those that have the largest energy deposition per unit length. Such a contribution is caused by fluctuations in the ionization processes and leads to the smearing and to the tail on the right hand side of the dE/dx spectrum.\nThe truncation factor is optimized with the data and we found its best value to be 0.7 which is the same as for the DESY 2019 test beam data [22]. This means that 70% of the clusters are kept for deposited energy per unit length calculations.\nThe dE/dx per cluster was calculated by taking the maximum of the sum of the waveforms of the pads constituting the cluster. Various cluster charge definitions were studied in [22] and it was shown that the charge defined using the sum of the waveforms results in a better dE/dx resolution. For each track sample the resolution was calculated as the ratio of sigma over mean of the Gaussian fit of the corresponding dE/dx distribution.\nFig. 18 shows the dE/dx resolution measured for horizontal tracks for\nvarious drift distances.\nFig. 19 shows the dE/dx resolution at various drift distances as a function\nof the track inclination angle in the ERAM plane.\nThese studies show that the dE/dx resolution is \u223c8.5% for horizontal tracks and stays between 7.5% and 9.6% for inclined and vertical tracks. Furthermore, it is independent of drift distance and of the electronics peaking time. It has been observed that the dE/dx resolution is controlled by balancing two factors: the mean charge per cluster and the number of clusters. Fig. 19 shows that the dE/dx resolution worsens for the angles > 45 degrees since for such angles a smaller number of clusters is reconstructed per track due to the rectangular shape of the ERAM.\nFinally, as in the case of spatial resolution, we looked for effects due to non-uniformities of the ERAM by using the X and Y scans. The results are shown in Fig. 20. We observe some differences, possibly due to nonuniformities in the gain of the ERAM, but in general, the resolution is below 10% for all the scans.\nThe observed results prove that the ERAM dE/dx resolution fulfills the\nrequirements for the ND280 upgrade."

Then the drifting electrons will move transversely in the ~V1 direction and will be projected on the ERAM with a shift \u2206:\n\u2206 = Zdrift \u00d7 \u2329 vy vz \u232a = Zdrift \u00d7 ( \u3008\u03b4\u3009\u03c9\u03c4 1 + (\u03c9\u03c4)2 ) (10)\nwhere Zdrift is the drift distance and \u3008\u03b4\u3009 is the average value of \u03b4 along the trajectory of the drifting electron.\nSince \u3008\u03b4\u3009 varies along the track, an apparent inclination of the track is\nobserved which can be evaluated with \u03c6app:\n\u03c6app = atan ( yL \u2212 yR XERAM ) (11)\nwhere XERAM is the width of the ERAM and yL and yR are the track\nvertical positions on the Left and Right edges.\nIt follows from Eq. (10) that the apparent inclination due to E\u00d7B effect is maximum for \u03c9\u03c4 = \u00b5B = 1. In our case, where the electron mobility is\nexpected around \u00b5 =2.8 T\u22121, this means B'0.36 T, which is consistent with what Fig. 24 shows.\nAs it can be seen in Fig. 11, the electrons drifting to the leftmost region of the ERAM are shifted upwards, while the ones drifting to the rightmost region are shifted downwards. The displacements perpendicular to the track depend on the component of the magnetic field on the track direction. It turns out that this component flips sign when the track crosses the inner volume of the PCMAG solenoid due to the symmetry of the radial components of its field.\nTo study this effect, we simulated the motion of drifting electrons with Garfield++ [35], under the proper electric and magnetic field conditions and the gas mixture used in the detector. For the magnetic field, we use the map based on previous measurements at DESY [36].\nFrom both data and simulation, we compute the inclination of tracks\nprojected on the ERAM, and compare the results. Fig. 25 shows that the simulation is able to reproduce the vertical displacement of drifting electrons as observed in the data.\nThe E\u00d7B effect dependence on the magnetic field is shown in Fig. 26 (a) for different values of magnetic field and different drift distances. As expected, without the magnetic field, there is no displacement in Y. When the magnetic field is on, as expected, a larger displacement is observed for small\nvalues of the magnetic field.\nIn Fig. 26 (b) we show the biases in the spatial resolution for different values of the magnetic field and as a function of the drift distance. The biases are small for all the drift distances when the magnetic field is off. When the magnetic field is on we observe larger biases for short and long drift distances, similar to the ones shown in Fig. 17. The larger biases are observed for values of the magnetic field of 0.2 and 0.4 T where the E\u00d7B effects are the largest.\nThe E\u00d7B effect generates displacements of the charge landing position on the anode surface which result in the observed inclination of the tracks. However, these displacements do not scale linearly along the track and deviations from the inclined direction are expected which could explain the biases observed in the spatial resolution described in Sect. 9. Further investigations are ongoing on this point but it is already clear that these biases share the same behavior with respect to the magnetic field as the E\u00d7B effect reported above."

            "text": "The ERAM \u201ccharge spreading\u201d effect has only a small impact on the resolution of the measurement of the dE/dx. In this approach, as also shown in [22], it is important to include in the dE/dx computation the charges \u201cshared\u201d among pads due to the diffusion and separate it from the \u201ccharge spreading\u201d time-dependent effect.\nIn contrast, the ERAM \u201ccharge spreading\u201d effect allows for a significant improvement of the spatial resolution, as the obtained results amply illustrate. Since both spatial and dE/dx resolutions depend on the relative gain\nbetween neighbouring pads, gain of each pad is being measured on a dedicated setup and accounting for pad-to-pad variations could potentially lead to better performances.\nThat is why measurements of RC and gain maps for all produced ERAM modules are being performed using a point-like iron X-ray source placed close to the ERAM. These measurements are complementary to the test beams data analyses and they are described in details in [29].\nThe newly developed simulation provides a reasonable description of both the \u201ccharge sharing\u201d and \u201ccharge spreading\u201d effects introduced in Sec. 2. This tool allows to understand deeper the data from the test beam, and to disentangle different features, especially when associated with the simpler data from the X-ray surveys."

            "text": "In this paper we present the performances of the prototype of the HATPCs for the T2K Near Detector upgrade obtained during a test beam at DESY performed in 2021. The TPC was instrumented with one of the ERAM detectors that will be installed in the HA-TPCs and the final HA-TPC readout electronics chain.\nThe test beam data allowed spatial and dE/dx resolutions to be determined as a function of the angle of the track with respect to the ERAM plane for all the drift distances of interest for T2K. Spatial resolution better than 800 \u00b5m is obtained for all the angles and all the drift distances using a dedicated clustering algorithm which is adapted to the track angle. The dE/dx resolution better than 10% is obtained for all the angles.\nThe data are compared with a simulation of the ERAM response, including the features of the resistive layer. As shown in this paper, the simulation is able to satisfactory reproduce the observed charge sharing between neighboring pads. Spatial resolution and dE/dx resolution are also in good agreement between data and simulation."
