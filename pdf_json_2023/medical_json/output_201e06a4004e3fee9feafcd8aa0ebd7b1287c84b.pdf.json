    "abstractText": "16 In the current context of developing aromatic beers, our study aims at deciphering the chemical 17 characterisation of cones from 39 wild hop genotypes collected in the North of France and replanted in an 18 experimental hop farm, as well as 10 commercial and 3 heirloom varieties, using HS-SPME/GC-MS for the 19 volatile compounds, UHPLC-UV for phenolic compound quantification, and UHPLC-IMS-HRMS for untargeted 20 metabolomics. These analyses revealed a strong opposition between wild accessions and reference varieties , 21 and an original chemical composition of some genotypes. 27 beers were produced with the same recipe, 22 analysed by SBSE-GC-MS and evaluated by panellists. The unique difference relates to the hops to be assessed 23 in order to determine their sensory profile. The different datasets were compared by OPLS-DA analysis in order 24 to identify chemical markers which may influence the hop aromatic potential. Our results highlight the aromatic 25 potential of some wild accessions, close to the commercial variety Cascade. 26",

            "text": "Beer is a fermented drink, which has traditionally been flavoured with hop (Humulus lupulus L., 31 Cannabaceae) since the Middle Ages. Female inflorescences, commonly referred as hops or hop cones, 32 are added to the wort for their bitterness and their aromatic originality as well as for their antiseptic 33 properties, linked to their original chemical composition (De Keukeleire et al., 1992). Original phenolic 34 compounds, including prenylated chalcones as xanthohumol and desmethylxanthohumol and 35 acylphloroglucinol derivatives (\u03b1-acids or humulone derivatives and \u03b2-acids or lupulone derivatives), 36 are produced in lupulin glands at the base of the bracts. Hop essential oil is also rich in non-oxygenated 37 monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, among them \u03b2-myrcene, \u03b1-humulene and \u03b2-caryophyllene 38 (Bocquet et al., 2018). When bittering hops are added to the wort during the boiling, \u03b1-acids are 39 isomerised into iso-\u03b1-acids, in cis or trans position (Sch\u00f6nberger & Kostelecky, 2011) and provide up 40 to 80% of a beer\u2019s bitterness (De Keukeleire et al., 1992). By contrast, aromatic hops are rather added 41 to the wort at the end or after its boiling, to minimise the evaporation of their volatile compounds 42 (Sharpe & Laws, 1981). Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are considered to be responsible for the 43 \u201choppy\u201d aroma of beer (Van Opstaele et al., 2010). \u03b1-humulene and \u03b2-caryophyllene can impart spicy 44 and woody notes to beer in particular due to the formation of oxygenated derivatives during wort 45 boiling. \u03b2-myrcene, an important contributor to fresh hop aroma, is largely lost during beer processing 46 except in dry hopping, but oxygenated derivatives formed can contribute to the fragrance. Among 47 other terpenoids, alcohol monoterpenes (linalool, geraniol, \u03b2-citronellol, \u03b1-terpineol) and aldehyde 48 monoterpenes (citral) provide floral and citrus notes to beer, respectively (Rettberg et al., 2018). By 49 contrast, other fruity aroma can be attributed to the presence of some esters, such as red berries-like 50 for ethyl-3-methylbutanoate, whereas aldehydes, such as hexanal, confer grassy fragrances to the beer 51 (Machado et al., 2021). Perception of hop volatile compounds after brewing remains complex. 52 Interactions between hop volatile compounds and other beer components (ethanol, carbohydrates, 53 yeast, hop bitter acids\u2026), combined to oxidation phenomena, require a thorough investigation to 54 understand their resulting effects on the final sensory profile of beer (Dietz et al., 2020). Hops also play 55 a role in the characteristics and stabilisation of the foam (De Keukeleire et al., 1992). The hydroxyl 56 group of the isohumulone acts as a surfactant, which helps to strengthen the electrostatic bonds 57 between the bubbles and thus stabilises the foam (Asano & Hashimoto, 1980). 58\nNorthern France is an historical region for beer craft and hop production. In the beginning of the 59 XXth century, 1220 ha of hops and nearly 2,000 breweries were inventoried in the region (Ducloux et 60 al., 1910). If beer production remains important (around 6 Bn hL in 2020), hop production for its part 61 clearly decreased during the XXth century, to reach only 35 ha today (Bart-Haas Group, 2021). This 62 decline can be explained by the economic context of the last century, when French brewers started to 63 import hops from the USA or Germany. However, in the context of the \u201cbeer craft movement\u201d, current 64 brewers have been looking for local and aromatic hops from sustainable or organic agriculture for a 65 decade (Paguet et al., 2022). In this context, the objective of our study is to investigate the diversity of 66 wild hops from Northern France, that can be used further to support a future varietal development 67 (Paguet et al., 2022). In a previous study, we investigated the genetic and the chemical diversity of 50 68 wild hop accessions collected in-situ from eleven natural sites of the North of France, in the Hauts-de-69 France region (Paguet et al., 2023). These wild accessions were compared to ten commercial varieties 70 and three old varieties coming from the same region for their genetic and chemical characteristics. 71 This study underlined a high genetic diversity and chemical variability among wild accessions (Paguet 72 et al., 2023). During the collection of samples, rhizomes were also collected and transplanted into our 73 experimental field to get a germplasm resource. The goal of the current study was to assess these 74 accessions in ex-situ conditions and to analyse their chemical diversity under more standardised 75 conditions. The more productive accessions were used for the production of beers using the same beer 76 style (lager style). The only difference in the recipe was the aromatic hops, with wild or commercial 77 origin. The beers were subjected to a sensory study in order to highlight the aromatic traits of these 78 hops after brewing. Recently, Machado et al., (2021) have studied the aromatic qualities of wild hops 79\non dry-hopped beers. Hong et al. (2022) evaluated, using partial least-squares discriminant analysis, 80 the link between chemical characteristics of cones and their influence in hop-tea or after brewing. 81\nWhile our previous article Paguet et al. (2023) concerned wild hop accessions collected under in-situ 82 conditions, the present study deals with these same accessions replanted in our experimental hop field, 83 and therefore constitute a new dataset. The chemical composition of wild hop accessions, grown under 84 ex-situ conditions, and their aromatic potential were determined using combined analytical methods, 85 including HS-SPME GC-MS, UHPLC-UV and UHPLC-IMS-HRMS. The physico-chemical characterisation of 86 the beers was carried out using analytical methods such as SBSE GC-MS, while a panel of experts was 87 used to characterise the beers according to a certain range of descriptors. Moreover, sensory evaluation 88 and multiple statistical methods (heatmap, principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least 89 squares discriminant analysis OPLS-DA) were carried out to explore the relationship between wild hops\u2019 90 chemical composition and beer aroma. 91"

The rhizomes of these accessions had also 98 been collected and transplanted in November 2019 into our experimental hop field (Ferme brasserie 99 Wagnonville, Douai, France). The present study focuses on the characterisation of the 32 most 100 productive accessions in cones to enable their analysis among the 50 that had been replanted. Cones 101 were collected at their maturity (80% humidity) in September 2021, oven-dried at a temperature below 102 40\u00b0C until they reached a moisture content of 10% and then stored under vacuum at -20\u00b0C before being 103 used for analysis. These wild accessions cultivated in field conditions were compared to 10 commercial 104 cultivars grown in the North of France region. They were selected among the ten most relevant varieties, 105 including so-called top hops used by craft brewers, such as Brewers Gold, Cascade, Challenger, Fuggles, 106 Goldings, Magnum, Northern Brewer, Nugget, Strisselspalt and Target. Cones of commercial hops, 107 collected in September 2021, were provided by the Northern France Hop Cooperative, Coophounord 108 (Bailleul, France). They were also compared to three heirloom varieties collected the same year. Three 109 genbank clones representing former Flander cultivars were included: Groene Bel, Coigneau, and Record, 110 coming from Belgium (Hoppecruyt, Poperinge, Belgium). Dried hop cones, kept vacuum-packed in cold 111 storage, were grounded in liquid nitrogen using a blender IKA A11 (Staufen, Germany) before being used 112 for extraction. 113\n2.1.2. Beer samples: Brewing processes 114\nTo investigate the aromatic potential of these wild hop accessions after brewing, the 17 more 115 productive hops of our collection were brewed, according to a recipe of blond Pilsner, for chemical 116 characterisation and sensory evaluation. These beers were compared to beers elaborated with 2 old 117 varieties (Groene Bel and Record) and seven commercial varieties (Nugget, Strisselspalt, Cascade, 118 Magnum, Brewers Gold, Target and Northern Brewers. The mash was brewed in 60 L in mash-in with 119 13 kg of Pilsen malt (La Malterie du Ch\u00e2teau, Beloeil, Belgium) at 67\u00b0C for 1 hour and 15 minutes and 120 filtered. Afterwards, the wort was boiled and 30 grams of bittering hops cv. Magnum in pellets 121 (Coophounord, Bailleul, France) were added 10 minutes after the beginning of boiling. After boiling, 122 the wort was divided into 6 brew tests of 10 L each for aroma hopping. 50 grams of dried hops to 123 evaluate, the only ingredient differentiating the brews, were added. A beer control without aromatic 124\nhop was also performed. Aromatic hops were added after the boiling step in infusion during the 125 intonation for 20 min (steeping/whirpool hops mode). After cooling, fermentation took place at 126 atmospheric pressure at 10\u00b0C (low fermentation) for one week, with Saccharomyces cerevisiae LalBrew 127 Nottingham yeasts (Lallemand Brewing, Felixstowe, United Kingdom). Lagering was carried out at 4\u00b0C 128 for 10 days. The beers were then racked in bottles, without filtration or pasteurisation. 129\n2.2. Chemical analysis 130\n2.2.1. Volatile compound analysis 131\n2.2.1.1. Volatile compound analysis in hops by HS-SPME GC-MS 132\nExtraction of volatile compounds by HS-SPME was reached using a triple-phase fiber, 50/30\u00b5m 133 DVB/CAR/PDMS (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA), that was preconditioned according to the instructions 134 of the manufacturer. Extraction was done on 2 grams of hop cone powder placed in a 20 mL vial 135 incubated at 45\u00b0C for 5 min. We used the same chromatographic conditions as those detailed in Paguet 136 et al., 2023, on an Agilent 7890 A gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer 137 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an MPS auto-sampler and an HP-5 MS 138 capillary column (30 m \u00d7 250 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Injections 139 were performed in splitless mode at 280 \u00b0C and helium was employed as the carrier gas at a flow rate 140 of 1.2 mL.min-1. The separation conditions were as follows: initial column temperature of 40\u00b0C for 2 141 min; then the temperature was successively increased by 4\u00b0C/min up to 200\u00b0C then by 20 \u00b0C/min up 142 to 300\u00b0C, where it was maintained for 5 min. The mass spectrometer was set to have a temperature 143 of the ion source at 230\u00b0C and was programmed with SCAN acquisition mode. 144\n2.2.1.2. Beer analysis by SBSE GC-MS. 145 Ten milliliters of beer samples were taken and placed in a vial with 2 grams of NaCl (VWR, 146 France) adding a stir bar (10mm x 0.5mm) with PDMS coating (SBSE Gerstel-Twister, USA) and stirring 147 for 120 min at 1000 rpm. Some samples were analysed twice on two different bottles, to ensure the 148 inter-bottle repeatability. After extraction, the stir bar was rinsed with some distilled water, dipped on 149 a filter paper and introduced in a glass thermal desorption tube (4 mm i.d. x 178 mm L). The stir bar 150 was then placed in the thermal desorption unit of an Agilent 7890 GC coupled to an Agilent 5975 C 151 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a MPS auto-sampler 152 and a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, 153 USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The oven was programmed as 154 follows: initial temperature of column of 40\u00b0C with a hold of 2 minutes; then increased by 6\u00b0C/min to 155 300\u00b0C, where it was maintained for 5 min. Stir bars were thermally desorbed by programming the 156 system from 40\u00b0C to 260\u00b0C with a rate of 6\u00b0C/min and held at this temperature for 5 min. The desorbed 157 analytes were cryofocused at -10\u00b0C. Injection was performed in the splitless mode. These analyses are 158 intended to verify intra-batch homogeneity and inter-batch variations. 159\n2.2.1.3. Volatile compound identification 160\nMassHunter Version B.06.00 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for data 161 acquisition and processing. General volatile compound profiles were established through a 162 chromatographic deconvolution process (Agilent MassHunter Unknowns Analysis) and 163 chromatographic areas were obtained for each volatile compound. Identification of the individual 164 components was based on: (a) comparison of the mass spectrum (MS) outcomes to those of 165 commercial databases: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST17) and Wiley7 (match 166 factor threshold > 700); (b) comparison of the retention index (RI) of each peak with literature RI data 167 (\u00b1 20) from the NIST WebBook. Experimental retention index (RI) of the compounds were calculated 168 following the injection of a mixture of n-alkanes C8-C20 (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). They 169\nwere first reported as a percentage of the total chromatographic area on Excel (Microsoft Excel 2016) 170 to allow a general analysis. 171\n2.2.2. Analysis of non-volatile compounds 172\n2.2.2.1. Sample preparation 173\nFor each hop studied in our study, hydro-ethanolic extracts were performed on 50 mg of dried 174 cone powder with 1 mL of ethanol-water mixture (9:1, v/v). A one-hour maceration session was carried 175 out in an ultrasonic bath. Afterwards, tubes were centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 20\u00b0C for 5 min. 176 Supernatant was then transferred in a tared tube. The exhausted matrix was then re-extracted two 177 times more following the same protocol and each time the supernatant was pooled with the first 178 extract. At the end of the three maceration sessions, extracts were then evaporated in a centrifugal 179 concentrator Genevac\u2122. Extracts were diluted at 1 mg/mL in methanol (Carlo Erba), filtered through 180 0.22 \u00b5m PTFE membrane and placed in glass vials for further LC-MS analysis. Quality control (QC) 181 samples were prepared by pooling 10 \u00b5L from each sample of the same round preparation and 182 thoroughly mixed. 183\n2.2.2.2. Setting up and validation of the quantification method of main phenolic compounds 184\nQuantification of xanthohumol, co-, n- and ad-humulone, co-, n- and ad-lupulone in each 185 hydro-ethanolic extract was performed on an Acquity UPLC\u00ae H-Class Waters\u00ae system (Waters, 186 Guyancourt, France) coupled with a Diode Array Detector (DAD) and a QDa ESI-Quadrupole Mass 187 Spectrometer. Separation was achieved using a Waters\u00ae Acquity BEH C18 column (pore size 300 \u00c5, 188 particle size 1.7 \u00b5m, 2.1 x 50 mm, Waters, Milford MA) connected to a 0.2 \u03bcm in-line filter. Solvent A 189 (water with 0.1% formic acid, v/v) and solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, v/v) were used as 190 mobile phases. Compounds were eluted using the following chromatographic conditions: the flow rate 191 was 0.3 mL/min; the column temperature was set at 30\u00b0C; the injection volume was 2 \u00b5L. The gradient 192 elution was performed using eluent A and eluent B: initial condition at 50% B, 0-1 min isocratic step, 193 1-3 min linear gradient to 75% B, 3-5 min isocratic step at 75% B, 5-7 min linear gradient to 100% B, 7-194 9 min isocratic step at 100% B, 9-9.5 min linear gradient to 50% B, 9.5\u201313 min isocratic step at 50% B 195 (total analysis time: 13 min). The ionisation was performed in negative mode. Cone voltage was set at 196 10 V. Probe temperature was 600 \u00b0C. Capillary voltage was 0.8 kV. The MS-Scan mode was used from 197 100 to 1000 Da. Xanthohumol and acylphloroglucinol derivatives were quantified according to the 198 International Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for 199 Human Use guideline Q2-R1 (ICH, 2005). Quantification was performed in UV at 370 nm for 200 xanthohumol and 330 nm for acylphloroglucinols. The quantitation method was set up using standards 201 purified in the laboratory according to the protocol detailed by Bocquet et al. (2019) and following the 202 methodology detailed in Paguet et al. (2023). Ad-humulone and ad-lupulone were also quantified by 203 the establishment of calibration range using standards purified in the same way as the one detailed in 204 Bocquet et al. (2019) for n- and ad- humulone and lupulone. The quantitation of each compound was 205 performed in five technical replicates. QC samples were analysed regularly along with unknown 206 samples. To reduce the effects of systematic errors, all samples were assigned to a random LC\u2013MS run 207 order and interspersed after every 20 injections with QC sample injections. Xanthohumol and \u03b1- and 208 \u03b2-acids were identified based on the retention time of purified standards and their mass spectra and 209 quantified using the quantification methods of previously set up on the Empower 3 software. Data 210 were exported from Empower 3 to Excel (Microsoft Excel 2016). 211\n2.2.2.3. UHPLC-IMS-HRMS analysis 212\nUHPLC-IMS-HRMS analysis were performed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I-Class system 213 interfaced with a Vion IMS Q-TOF (Ion Mobility Quadrupole Time-of-flight) hybrid mass spectrometer, 214\nequipped with an electrospray ionisation (ESI) source (Waters, Manchester, UK). The autosampler was 215 programmed to inject 2 \u00b5L of each sample. Chromatographic separation of the analytes was carried 216 out using the same column, a Waters\u00ae Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm, Waters, Milford 217 MA) connected to a 0.2 \u03bcm in-line filter maintained at 40\u00b0C. The UHPLC method was carried out 218 following the same protocol and procedure described previously for the quantification: the flow rate 219 was 0.3 mL/min; the column temperature was set at 30\u00b0C; solvent A (water with 0.1% formic acid, v/v) 220 and solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, v/v); the gradient was the following: initial conditions 221 at 50% B, 0-1 min isocratic mode, 1-3 min linear gradient to 75% B, 3-5 min isocratic mode at 75% B, 222 5-7 min linear gradient to 100% B, 7-9 min isocratic mode at 100% B, before re-equilibration time of 4 223 min. For HRMS, the ESI parameters were set as follows: capillary voltage, 2.4 kV in negative mode; 224 source temperature, 120\u00b0C; desolvation temperature of 450\u00b0C. Time-of-flight (TOF) MS was operated 225 in sensitive mode. The data were acquired in high-definition MSE (HDMSE) over a mass range of m/z 226 50-1200 at a mass resolving power of 50,000 FWHM and a scan time of 0.2 s. Spectra were acquired 227 and processed with the UNIFI software (version 1.9.4, Waters), allowing to generate the data matrix 228 with default parameters comprising the retention time, mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values, and peak 229 intensity. The untargeted metabolomic data matrix was cleaned by removing the variables with a 230 significant variance (>35%) in the quality control (QC) and the variables present in the blank. A 231 minimum intensity threshold was chosen at 500 to keep the variable. Metabolites were principally 232 identified by matching the accurate masses, retention times and fragmentation patterns with those of 233 the reference standards and literature references. Supplementary analyses in DDA mode were done, 234 with a collision energy of 20 eV on QC to perform dereplication analysis on UNIFI and MassLynx 235 (version 4.1, Waters) softwares. 236\n2.3. Beer characterisation 237\n2.3.1. Physico-chemical characterisation of beers. 238\nBeers were characterised according to different physico-chemical parameters following the 239 American Society of Brewing Chemists recommandations (1992). Samples were preliminarily degassed 240 by agitation in the open air. 241\n(i) Beer colour (EBC). Beer colour was determined by an official method from ASBC, in which the 242 absorbance of beer samples was measured at 430 nm using a spectrophotometer UV-1280 243 (Shimadzu, France). EBC was achieved following equations: EBC = 50*D*Abs430nm, where D is the 244 dilution factor, and Abs430nm the absorbance at 430 nm. 245 (ii) Bitterness dosage (IBU). Bitterness was determined following Kawa-Rygielska et al. (2019) 246 method: 10 mL of beer sample was added to 1 mL of HCl and 20 mL of isooctane. Tubes were 247 stirred for 15 min and centrifuged at 1880 G for 3 min. The supernatant was measured at 275 248 nm against a blank control (pure isooctane) with a spectrophotometer UV-1280 (Shimadzu, 249 France). IBU values were achieved as follows: IBU = Abs275nm*50 where IBU is the International 250 Bitterness Unit, and Abs275nm is the absorbance at 275 nm. 251 (iii) Determination of total acidity. Acidity of beer is considered as mainly due to the presence of 252 malic acid, measured by acid-base titration with soda NaCl 0.1 M, using phenolphthalein as 253 indicator of equivalence. 254 (iv) Wort density and alcohol content. Wort density (expressed in \u00b0Plato) and alcohol content (% v/v) 255 were measured with a densimeter Alex 500 (Anton Paar, France) on 50 mL of beer sample 256 vacuum filtered through Kieselguhr. Repeatability of bottles was tested using a Student test. 257\n2.3.2. Sensory characterisation of beers 258\n2.3.2.1. Panel training 259\nTwenty-one trained subjects (13 men and 8 women) were enrolled in a training program 260 designed to produce beer experts. They were trained 1hour a week to describe beers on seventeen 261 descriptors (intensity of the smell, hoppy smell, malty smell, fruity smell, intensity of taste, acid, bitter, 262 floral, hops, citrus, malt, sweet, spicy, red fruits, yellow fruits, astringent and bitter persistence) and to 263 evaluate the intensity of these descriptors on a non-structured linear scale. These descriptors have 264 been chosen in the literature and were recalled by the panelists during vocabulary generation sessions. 265 At the time of the experiment, the panelists had already received 12 hours of training. At this point, 266 they should have developed a consensual vocabulary, along with the ability to detect the descriptors 267 on which they have been trained. 268\n2.3.2.2. Procedure 269\nThe assessors evaluated the 26 beer samples (17 with wild hops, 7 with commercial varieties, 270 2 with old varieties) in duplicate during 12 sessions under standard sensory conditions (ISO, 2016). 271 Samples were presented in transparent glasses and 20 mL were served between 8 and 10\u00b0C, in a 272 sequential monadic way. Their presentation order was different for each assessor and based on a 273 Williams\u2019 Latin-square arrangement. Subjects had to evaluate beers on the 17 descriptors according to 274 a non-structured linear scale from 0 to 10 using FIZZ software (Biosystemes, Dijon, France). The 275 significant descriptors were identified with three factors ANOVA (product, repetition and panelist), 276 measuring the p-value on the factor product. 277\n2.4. Data analysis 278\nFor each simple dataset collected, data were compiled into an Excel sheet. Statistical analysis as 279 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for quantitation of prenylated phenolic compounds, untargeted 280 metabolomics and sensory analysis, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) for composition of 281 volatile compounds and sensory analysis, as well as heatmaps for composition of volatile compounds 282 and quantitation of phenolic compounds were achieved using XLStat (Addinsoft, 2022). On the 283 quantitation triplicate, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test with p 284 < 0.05 was conducted using XLStat (Addinsoft, 2022). Student tests for the verification of the inter-285 bottles repeatability and the choice of the selection of the most significant descriptors were achieved 286 using the statistical tests on XLStat (Addinsoft, 2022). 287\nTo link analytical measurement and sensory analysis, OPLS-DA model was performed using MATLAB 288 R2014a (MathWorks, Natick, MA) software. OPLS-DA model provide insights into separations between 289 experimental groups, here based on sensorial analysis discrimination results, based on analytical 290 measurements (here the phytochemical characterisation of cones). Hence, the OPLS model comprises 291 two blocks of model variations: 1) the Y-predictive block, which represents the variation between the 292 classes, and 2) the Y-orthogonal block also referred to the uncorrelated variation, which constitutes 293 the within class variation (Bylesj\u00f6 et al., 2007). As we preferred to focus on the link between cone 294 phytochemistry and panel-assessed beer aromas, the SBSE-GC-MS analysis dataset was not included 295 in our orthogonal analysis. 296\n297\n3. Results 298\n3.1. Chemical characterisation of cones 299\n3.1.1. Volatile compound analysis by HS-SPME GC-MS 300\nThe putative identification of volatile compounds by HS-SPME GC-MS revealed the presence 301 of 65 different compounds among hops studied in the study. Thirty-two compounds were detected in 302\nfixing a threshold at 1%. This volatile compound analysis was represented by a heatmap and a 303 dendrogram (Figure 1). The majority of these compounds were monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes 304 (Table S1). In particular, we identified \u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b2-myrcene and \u03b1-humulene, known as the 305 main volatile compounds of hops, in all accessions characterised (Figure 1A). The dendrogram 306 associated with the AHC (Figure 1B) distinguished 4 different classes of accessions according to their 307 content of volatile compounds. The blue cluster was mainly composed of commercial and old cultivars, 308 as well as wild accessions I3 and G2. These accessions were characterised by a high content of the main 309 hop volatile compounds, as \u03b1-humulene, \u03b2-myrcene and \u03b2-caryophyllene. In Figure 1B, we then noted 310 that the commercial accessions Cascade, Fuggle and Strisselspalt, known for their aromatic 311 characteristics, were distributed in different clusters from other commercial accessions known for 312 their bitter potential. The purple cluster, including Strisseltspalt, showed a high level of other volatile 313 compounds, such as limonene, germacrene and \u03b2-elemene. The green and purple classes, represented 314 by different accessions, both wild, old and commercial, as well as the red class, only composed of a 315 few wild accessions, showed a lower content of the majority non-oxygenated terpenes (\u03b1-humulene, 316 \u03b2-myrcene and \u03b2-caryophyllene). By contrast, they showed higher contents of minor volatile 317 compounds that were not taken into account in this qualitative classification as \u03b3-muurolene (for B4 318 and H4 in the purple cluster) or \u03b1-cedrol (for I8 in the green one), known for their woody aromas (Table 319 S1). We also identified the presence of some particular sesquiterpenes in both wild and commercial 320 accessions, such as \u03b1-bergamotene (in Cascade, Fuggle, H2, H3 and I8) or \u03b2-farnesene, \u03b1- and \u03b2-321 selinene, or even \u03b2- and \u03b3- elemene mostly present in wild accessions (Figure 1A). 322\n3.1.2. Quantification of main phenolic compounds by UHPLC-UV 323\nUHPLC-UV analysis revealed the presence of seven main peaks at the retention times 2.76, 324 4.35, 4.73, 4.83, 6.26, 6.87 and 7.00 minutes attributed to xanthohumol (XN), \u03b1-acids (co-, n-, ad-325 humulone) and \u03b2-acids (co-, n-, ad-lupulone) respectively. This attribution was based both on their 326 retention times compared with those of the standards purified in the laboratory and on their mass 327 spectra. Xanthohumol, co-humulone, n-humulone, ad-humulone, co-lupulone, n-lupulone and ad-328 lupulone were then quantified in 52 crude extracts of cone samples using the quantitation method 329 setting up by UHPLC-UV. Acceptable linearity was observed for each compound over the concentration 330 range used for calibration (Table S2). Evaluation of the recovery data of the quantification method 331 showed acceptable intra and inter-day precisions for xanthohumol (RSD % = 18.64, 13.69), co-332 humulone (RSD % = 13.13, 6.40), n-humulone (RSD % = 4.01, 2.55), ad-humulone (RSD % = 15.55, 333 16.58), co-lupulone (RSD % = 10.19, 11.17), n-lupulone (RSD % = 16.12, 9.7) and ad-lupulone (RSD % = 334 15.15, 16.68). Results were expressed in \u00b5g/mL and converted in percentages of dry matter. Statistical 335 analysis with a Tukey\u2019s test revealed significant differences among hop samples in terms of 336 composition in phenolic compounds (Table S3). Overall, commercial varieties showed a higher content 337 of n-humulone, ad-humulone and xanthohumol, which may assert their bitter potential, unlike in wild 338 accessions which produced more \u03b2-acids. Nevertheless, the cultivars Strisselspalt and Fuggle were 339 distinguished by low contents of phenolic compounds than other commercial varieties. On the other 340 side, some wild hops showed higher levels than commercial varieties. In the detail, higher contents in 341 xanthohumol, total \u03b1-acids and total \u03b2-acids were observed for the accessions Target (0.045 %), 342 Magnum (2.748 %) and Groene Bel (3.138 %) respectively. Lower contents were observed for C3 (0.005 343 %), D1 (0.100%) and I5 (0.353 %) respectively (Figure 2A and Table S3). Figure 2A thus revealed low 344 contents of humulone for wild hops compared to commercial varieties. Some exceptions were noted 345 for the wild hops I3, I1, G2, B3, D3 and J3 that showed contents of humulone similar to commercial or 346 old cultivars (from 1.274 % to 0.621 %). Wild hops also displayed low contents of ad-humulone and 347 xanthohumol. By contrast, most wild accessions had levels of co-humulone and \u03b2-acids which were 348 not negligible. These phenolic compounds will have a different impact on bitterness. The output 349 process of the quantification represented in the form of PCA (Figures 2B and 2C) revealed a good 350 explanation of the distribution of variables, equal to 92.32 %, with a contribution of PC1 and PC2 equal 351 to 72.48 % and 19.84 % respectively. Moreover, the biplot clearly revealed a good correlation between 352\n\u03b1-acid and xanthohumol contents on one side and \u03b2-acid contents on the other side (Figure 2C). 353 According to this figure, most of the commercial and heirloom varieties had higher contents in n-354 humulone, ad-humulone and xanthohumol. On the contrary, wild hops (Locations A to K) and the old 355 variety Groene Bel showed higher \u03b2-acid contents (co-, n- and ad-lupulone). The strong separation 356 between commercial cultivars and wild hops was also illustrated by the dendrogram (Figure S1). The 357 colouration of the accessions, on the biplot and on the dendrogram, based on their clustering 358 previously achieved with their composition in volatile compounds, allowed us to evaluate the 359 composition both in main phenolic compounds and in volatile compounds. Except for the old variety 360 Groene Bel, this new biplot showed that the accessions were globally grouped according to their 361 colour, and therefore according to their composition in volatile compounds (Figure 2B). This study also 362 underlined that the accession I3 had a chemical composition very close to those of commercial 363 varieties because it belonged to the same cluster both for GC-MS analysis and quantification by UHPLC-364 UV (Figure 1B and Figure S1). 365\n3.2.2.3. Dereplication and untargeted metabolomics by UHPLC-IMS-HRMS 366\nFrom 164 601 variables acquired, we finally kept 262 variables (160 variables from 1 to 7 min) 367 after cleaning the matrix. From these 160 variables, 15 compounds were identified based on previous 368 works including Farag et al. (2012) and Nic\u00e1cio et al. (2022) (Table S4). These partially annotated 369 metabolites were classified as putative MS/MS annotations and one compound was labeled as an 370 unknown compound (Figure 3A). Among them, the 7 compounds previously quantified (xanthohumol, 371 co-, n- and ad-humulone and co-, n- and ad-lupulone) were also identified using PDA spectrum and 372 retention times. As presented in the Table S5 and on the Figure 3C, different classes of metabolites 373 were represented, in particular chalcones and flavanones [desmethylxanthohumol (1), xanthohumol 374 (2), isoxanthohumol (3)], as well as acylphloroglucinol derivatives including \u03b1-acids and oxidised 375 derivatives [cohumulone (5), 4-deoxycohumulone (6), humulone (7), humulinone (8), adhumulone (9), 376 deoxyhumulone (10), pr\u00e9humulone (11)] and \u03b2-acids [postlupulone (12), colupulone (13), lupulone 377 (14), adlupulone (15), prelupulone (16)]. Figures 3B and C showed the PCA score plots for data acquired 378 in HRMS in negative ion mode corresponding to the UHPLC retention times ranging from 1 to 7 min. 379 Considering the two principal components, we explained 44.78% of the variance distributed as follows: 380 28.31% for the PC1 and 16.47% for the PC2. On Figure 3B, individuals were again coloured according 381 to their composition in volatile compounds after the AHC shown on the Figure 1B. Thus, we noted that 382 we globally had the same repartition of blue varieties after PCA treatment on the UHPLC-HRMS data; 383 while accessions from other groups were more mixed. The identification of some compounds on Figure 384 3C can provide some explanations to this distribution. Individuals belonging to the first cluster coloured 385 in blue, which gathered most of the commercial and old varieties (in square), globally showed higher 386 contents in \u03b1- and \u03b2-acids. Figure 3C also highlighted that chemical families, including chalcones, \u03b1- 387 and \u03b2-acids, were close on the loading plot. These results therefore allowed the identification of some 388 accessions with high contents of \u03b1-acids, not only in co-, n- and ad-humulone previously quantified. 389 We have previously identified two accessions, I3 and G2, with a composition in volatile compounds 390 and \u03b1-acids close to those of commercial varieties. Figures 3D and 3E, only focused on wild accessions, 391 confirmed the high content of \u03b1-acid derivatives in these two accessions. These figures also allowed 392 us to better compare wild accessions with each other. It hence appeared that wild accessions, with a 393 composition in volatile compounds close to those of commercial varieties (in red and in blue), had a 394 lower content of acylphloroglucinol derivatives, while some wild accessions, as the accessions A5, B2, 395 B3, I1 or H1, had a higher content of these compounds. However, it would be relevant to continue the 396 identification of the chemical markers located at the top of PC2 and which differentiate several wild 397 individuals. The distribution of individuals on the loading plot was strongly different from the biplot of 398 the quantification (Figure 2B), and the explanation of the variance was relatively weak (less than 50%), 399 thereby reflecting the high chemical diversity of the accessions studied. 400\n3.2. Chemical characterisation after brewing: beer analysis and sensory analysis 401\nOnce the hop accessions have been chemically characterised, we got interested in their aromatic 402 and gustative potential after brewing by sensory analysis. The beers elaborated according to a same 403 base beer style (lager) and with the different hops to evaluate were first characterised by physico-404 chemical analysis before being tasted by a panel. The main objective of these analyses was to 405 characterise the matrix and to ensure the homogeneity of the batches tasted by the panelists. 406\n3.2.1. Physico-chemical analysis 407\nPhysico-chemical characterisations were based on a measurement of IBU, EBC, alcohol content, 408 residual sugars and total acidity. These analyses revealed IBUs ranging from 13.1 (Cascade) to 38.2 409 (Magnum); alcohol content from 4.69 (F1) to 6.6 (Groene Bel) % v/v; EBC from 8.2 (H2) to 20.8 (H1); 410 total acidity from 4.1 (G1) to 8.1 (Northern Brewers); residual sugars from 1.190 (Target) to 2.3 \u00b0P (B3) 411 (Table S5). Higher IBUs were measured for beers brewed with commercial bittering hops (Brewers 412 Gold, Magnum), while beers brewed with wild hops had IBUs comparable to those of beers brewed 413 with commercial aromatic hops (Striesselspalt and Target). EBCs measured were those of a Lager beer, 414 according to the Pilsen malt used. Alcohol content, total acid concentration and density were not 415 statistically influenced by the hop used for the brewing. Furthermore, student test (p = 0.95) revealed 416 no significant differences among bottles of a same batch for alcohol, colour and residual sugars (with 417 p-value respectively equal to 0.282, 0.618 and 0.223), while for total acidity, p-value was less than 418 0.0001, which indicated a high level of variability among bottles from a same batch (Table S6). 419\n3.2.2. Analysis of volatile compounds by SBSE GC-MS 420\nIn total, 180 volatile compounds were identified by SBSE GC-MS in beer samples. These compounds 421 were mainly represented by the ester chemical class (Figure S2). We also detected some 422 sesquiterpenes, as \u03b1-humulene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-selinene and alloaromadendrene 423 (Table S7) previously identified in hop cones. Some monoterpenes, such as citronellol, were detected 424 in beers but were not found in cones. The analysis of the beer brewed without aromatic hop revealed 425 the quasi absence of terpenoids in this sample, and thus confirmed that terpenes and their derivatives 426 present in other beer samples could come from hop tested. Lastly, analysis on several different bottles 427 from the same batch revealed a similar composition in volatile compounds and thus confirmed the 428 homogeneity of the flavours of the beers tasted by the panelists, even if they come from different 429 bottles. 430\n3.2.3. Sensory results 431\nOn the 17 descriptors on which the panel was trained (Table S8), we finally retained nine 432 descriptors which were significant (p-value <0.05%) (Table S9). These descriptors were: hoppy smell, 433 fruity smell, intensity of the taste, malt taste, hoppy taste, citrus taste, yellow fruits, bitter taste and 434 bitter persistence. To process data by PCA, we kept the first two principal components explaining 75.06 435 % of the variance, and we considered the beer brewed with no aromatic hop as a supplementary 436 observation (Figure 4A). PC1 (56.27% of the variance explained) translated the intensity of the taste, 437 bitter taste, bitter persistence, fruity smell, yellow fruits, and hoppy taste and smell; while PC2 438 (18.79%) translated the citrus and malt tastes (Figure 4B). Figure 4A and Figure 4B highlighted the 439 bitter taste of beers brewed with so-called bitter commercial varieties (such as Northern Brewers, 440 Magnum, Brewers Gold or Target) which had previously revealed high \u03b1-acid levels. The HAC (Figure 441 4C) clearly opposed the cluster made of beers brewed with commercial varieties on one side (in blue) 442 and another cluster composed of beers brewed with wild accessions on the other side (in red). The 443 clear separation already observed for the chemical analysis of the 52 hop samples was thus confirmed 444 after brewing (Figure S3). Nevertheless, the accessions I3 and G2 whose chemical composition was 445 fairly close to the marketed varieties no longer belonged this time to the same cluster concerning the 446 taste felt by the panelists after brewing. By contrast, in this sensory analysis, 5 wild accessions (B3, H1, 447\nH2, I9, K5) of our collection belonged to the same cluster as commercial and old varieties (Figure 4C). 448 The chemical composition of these accessions was far from the reference varieties in regards to non-449 targeted metabolomic analysis. However, accessions H1, H2, K5 and I9 revealed the presence of some 450 particular volatile compounds, while the accession B3 had high levels of some phenolic compounds. 451 The proximity of the wild accessions H2 with the aromatic cultivar Cascade, and I9 with K5, observed 452 on Figure 4A, had already been observed on the dendrogram 1B for the analysis of volatile compounds. 453 \u03b1-bergamotene was identified in accession H2, \u03b3-elemene in accession K5 as well as \u03b2-elemene, \u03b3-454 elemene, \u03b1-selinene, \u03b2-selinene and alloaromadendrene in accession I9. This composition was close 455 to those of the accession Strisselspalt for example, also containing alloaromadendrene, \u03b1-selinene, \u03b2-456 selinene and \u03b3-elemene and that could explain the fruity, hoppy and citrus perception of these 457 accessions according to panellists. Concerning the chemical composition of beers analysed by SBSE GC-458 MS, some accessions (e.g. Brewers Gold, Magnum, B3, G1, I3 and I5) had a high level of monoterpenes 459 and sesquiterpenes. Nevertheless, among these beers, those brewed with wild accessions did not 460 show similar aroma profiles according to the panel. For the beer brewed with no aromatic hop (in 461 yellow on Figure 4A), analysed in the PCA as a supplementary observation, and therefore not included 462 in the AHC, panelists did not discriminate it from the other samples tasted, and seemed to be fairly 463 close to the accession G2 and the old variety Record, which may not have significant aromatic impact 464 on the beer. 465\n3.3. Discriminant analysis: OPLS-DA 466\nTo objectively assess the influence of the chemical composition of hop cones used for brewing in 467 the final beer, a supervised OPLS-DA approach based on the chemical profiling and gustative evaluation 468 was performed. Two classes were selected in this study, according to the results of the AHC of the 469 sensory analysis: group 1 (n = 13 in blue) and group 2 (n = 13 in red) (Figure 4C). In total, 225 variables 470 identified in the two datasets previously collected to characterise the chemical diversity of hops 471 (volatile compound analysis by HS-SPME GC-MS: 65 variables, untargeted metabolomic analysis by 472 UHPLC-IMS-HRMS: 160 variables) were used for the OPLS-DA model to explain the aromatic diversity 473 of the 26 accessions used in brewing tests. The combination of these data was expected to provide a 474 global profiling of the gustative qualities of hops in an integrative brewing perspective. The consensus 475 OPLS-DA strategy was applied for the differential analysis of the two aromatic groups and the 476 simultaneous analysis of the two blocks of data. 477\nThe block contributions of the predictive latent variable indicated an equivalent importance of the 478 volatile cone analysis by HS-SPME GC-MS (p: 51.91%, o: 52.05%) or of the untargeted metabolomics 479 by UHPLC-IMS-HRMS (p: 48.08 %, o: 47.94 %) (Figure S4). A model with one predictive and one 480 orthogonal latent variable was evaluated as the best model based on the DQ2 value computed during 481 leave one-out cross validation, i.e., DQ2 = 0.393. Hence, in view of this relative low value, the proposed 482 model is an explanatory model and not a predictive model. Score plots and the contributions of the 483 model were presented in Figure 5. This model confirmed the clear opposition between the two beer 484 groups defined by the panelists, separated by the predictive component (Figure 5A) and used for the 485 model construction. As discussed before, Figure 5B highlighted the influence of some volatile 486 compounds on the aromatic profile of beers. Beers brewed with commercial varieties were influenced 487 by their content of main hop volatile compounds (as \u03b1-humulene, \u03b2-myrcene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, linalool 488 or \u03b2-pinene), while beers brewed with wild accessions were more distinguished by the composition of 489 their cones in \u03b1- and \u03b2-selinene, alloaromadendrene, \u03b2- and \u03b3-elemene or \u03b1-bergamotene. This model 490 also revealed that the bitterness of beers was imparted by acylphloroglucinols derivatives (Figure 5C), 491 and then corroborated the bitter potential of commercial varieties compared to wild hops, which were 492 not distributed along the axes of the bitterness (Figure 4A). 493\n4. Discussion 494\nThis study was focused on the chemical composition of wild hops and their aromatic potential in 495 beers (Figure 6). As regards the chemistry of cones, we identified the main volatile compounds of hops, 496 \u0251-humulene, \u03b2-myrcene and \u03b2-caryophyllene, in all accessions of our collection. In particular, \u03b1-497 humulene and \u03b2-caryophyllene are known for their spicy and woody smell (Rettberg et al., 2018). We 498 also found original volatile compounds, present in a few wild accessions, as \u03b1- and \u03b2-selinene, 499 alloaromadendrene or \u03b2- and \u03b3-elemene. Patzak et al. (2010) reported that selinene was particularly 500 present in wild hops compared with North American hops. This work also highlighted the strong 501 chemical opposition between commercial and old varieties compared with wild accessions on their 502 phytochemical composition (volatile compounds and phenolic compounds) and gustatory quality. A 503 certain form of opposition between varieties and experimental germplasms had already been reported 504 by Yan et al. (2019) especially on volatile compound composition, using GC\u2013accTOFMS, on 30 505 Australian hop genotypes. Furthermore, recent studies such as Morcol et al., (2020) or Van Holle et al. 506 (2021) suggested a terroir effect on hop chemical composition. The results of this study also served 507 this hypothesis as chemical diversity underlined by non-targeted analyses was much reduced on the 508 accessions of this study, all coming from the same experimental hop field, compared to the accessions 509 collected in-situ in our previous study Paguet et al. (2023). Nevertheless, the ex-situ collection also 510 allowed a monitoring of hop maturation and thus collection of the cones at their optimum maturity, 511 which avoided the appearance of degradation compounds. For instance, contrary to our previous 512 study, we noticed high levels of \u03b2-myrcene in all accessions without exception. Myrcene usually does 513 not make a contribution to hop aroma in beer, because its concentration is often far below the sensory 514 threshold level, due to its evaporation during wort boiling Kishimoto et al. (2005). However, it may be 515 used as a marker for cones ripening because monoterpenes are the last produced metabolites (Briggs 516 et al., 2004). Some specific hop volatile components, such as geraniol for Cascade or \u03b2-pinene for 517 Centennial, were identified as statistically relevant for forecasting dry-hop aroma quality (Lafontaine 518 et al., 2018). Phytochemical profiling of our collection led to the identification of some wild accessions 519 with a profile close to those of commercial cultivars (e.g. accessions I3 and G2). Previous genotyping 520 in Paguet et al. (2023) revealed that wild accessions of our collection were significantly different from 521 commercial and old cultivars grown in the north of France and were therefore not from an existing 522 commercial variety (Figure S5). Hence, the chemical diversity of wild accessions, even under ex-situ 523 conditions, was probably due to the wide genetic diversity previously observed and is also reflected in 524 significant morphological differences (Figure S6). Among this chemical diversity, we have identified 525 some derivatives of bitter acids. Wild accessions revealed high levels in \u03b2-acids. \u03b2-acids do not directly 526 impact the taste of beer, but their oxidation in hulupones provides a very bitter taste to the beer (Van 527 Cleemput et al., 2009). 528\nHence, after highlighting the chemical diversity of these hops grown under the same conditions, 529 we evaluated their aromatic potential after brewing. An intra-batch physico-chemical characterisation 530 made it possible to check that all the panellists tasted the same product. Nevertheless, inter-batch 531 variations were observed, particularly in terms of the product\u2019s acidity and its residual sugar content. 532 These differences may result from slightly different fermentation conditions, and did not really impact 533 the descriptors appreciated by the panellists and therefore should not have significantly affected the 534 taste characterisation of the products. After evaluation by a panel, we underlined that some wild 535 accessions had a gustative potential fairly close to commercial varieties, as the accession H1, with a 536 bitter perception. Some other wild accessions, H2, I9 and K5, belonging to the same cluster on the 537 dendrogram, rather showed hoppy and fruity taste as the commercial variety Cascade or the old 538 variety Groene Bel. This fruity and hoppy taste may be due to the presence of some volatile 539 compounds, as \u03b3-elemene or \u03b1- or \u03b2-selinene, which were also detected after brewing by SBSE and 540 were known for their herbal and fresh flavors (Table S1). These statements have been confirmed by 541 the OPLS model, which underlined the influence of acylphloroglucinol derivatives and main hop volatile 542 compounds on the bitterness and aromatic properties of beers brewed with commercial varieties on 543 one hand, and the influence of less common volatile compounds and typical of our wild hop collection, 544 on the other. However, the aromatic impact of hops in beer remains very complex to study because 545\nbeer is a complex matrix due to the interaction with the other ingredients of the beer and the effects 546 of fermentation etc. (Dietz et al., 2020), as evidenced by the relative low validation score of our OPLS 547 model. For example, the presence of citronellol, found in some beer composition but in no single hop, 548 can be derived from a de novo synthesis, induced by yeast during the fermentation (Dietz et al., 2020). 549 Hence, Van Holle et al. (2017) chose to carry out a sensory analysis on single hop beers in order to 550 enhance the perception of the aromatic contribution of tested hop on beer. Machado et al., (2021) 551 studied wild accessions coming from Portugal and assessed their gustative potential on dry-hopped 552 beers. Dry-hopping allowed highlighting of the aromatic variations between different accessions 553 (Podeszwa & Harasym, 2016). In our study, we also greatly reduced bias because we tested our hops 554 in a same lager-style recipe, with a unique magnum bittering hop to provide bitterness, and in steeping 555 (whirlpool) hop mode. The only ingredient modifying the recipe was the aromatic hops, wild or 556 commercial, to be tested and it was added after boiling in infusion to preserve the volatile compounds. 557 However, it could also be interesting to test in parallel the organoleptic profile of hops, without 558 brewing, to avoid the interaction with malt and fermentation metabolites, as Martins et al. (2020) 559 evaluated the aromatic potential of hops by check-all-that-apply analysis. 560\n5. Conclusion 561\nBy means of a targeted and untargeted chemical fingerprinting and chemometrics approach, this 562 study was able to identify compounds in our wild hops collection from Northern France that make 563 them distinct from commercial varieties. Volatile compound analysis revealed a strong opposition 564 between commercial and old cultivars and wild accessions of our collection; this opposition was also 565 noticeable on the quantification of phenolic compounds and sensory evaluation, but less strong as 566 regards untargeted metabolomics. 567\nSome hops of wild accessions, such as I3 and G2, showed a chemical composition fairly close to 568 commercial varieties. However, other wild accessions, such as H2, K5 and I9, showed an aromatic 569 potential more pronounced during sensory analysis and close to the commercial variety Cascade or 570 the old variety Groene Bel. OPLS-DA allowed the identification of chemical markers of cones which 571 lead to a beer with sensory characteristics close to those brewed with the cultivars currently used by 572 brewers. This study underlined the potential for further investigating genetic markers to understand 573 the differences in the volatile compound concentrations as the phenotypic expression for each hop 574 cultivar. These results illustrated the difference between commercially germplasms resulting from 575 robust selection programs and the wild germplasms. This analytical approach thereby confirmed the 576 potential of wild hops for varietal development and gave some information to implement a systematic 577 targeted breeding approach. 578\nFundings 579\nThis work has been carried out in the framework of Feader project 2021-2024 (n\u00b0 35/2020) which 580 is financed by European Union and the Hauts-de-France Region, as well as the CPER BiHauts Eco de 581 France funded by both the French State and the Hauts-de-France Region.
