Comparative Study of Porphyrin Derivatives: Investigate the effects of different porphyrin derivatives (including various metallated porphyrins beyond manganese) on the mobility of colorectal cancer cells and normal cells under white light irradiation. This study would explore whether different metal ions in the porphyrin core could enhance the selective inhibition of cancer cell migration or provide insights into the photodynamic mechanisms at play.

Mechanisms of Porphyrin Uptake and Localization: Delve deeper into the mechanisms behind porphyrin uptake and their subcellular localization, focusing on understanding how these compounds interact with cellular structures, such as the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and other organelles. This research could include the use of advanced imaging techniques and biochemical assays to track porphyrin distribution and its effects on cellular functions.

Combination Therapies with Porphyrin-based PDT: Explore the efficacy of combining porphyrin-based PDT with other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy, in colorectal cancer models. This approach could reveal synergistic effects that enhance tumor cell death, reduce metastasis, and potentially minimize side effects associated with conventional therapies.

Role of Porphyrins in Modulating Tumor Microenvironment: Investigate how porphyrins and PDT influence the tumor microenvironment, especially focusing on immune cell recruitment, vascular changes, and extracellular matrix modification. Understanding these interactions could uncover new strategies to enhance PDT efficacy and induce a more robust anti-tumor immune response.

Development of Light Delivery Systems for Internal Tumors: Given the challenge of delivering light to internal tumors such as those in colorectal cancer, research into innovative light delivery systems (e.g., fiber optics, nanoparticles that convert near-infrared light to visible light) that can activate porphyrins deep within tissues could significantly enhance the applicability and effectiveness of PDT in treating deep-seated tumors.
