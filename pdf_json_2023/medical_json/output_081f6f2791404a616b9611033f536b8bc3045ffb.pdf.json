    "abstractText": "Background: The KIAA1524 gene encodes an oncoprotein, CIP2A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of the Akt kinase B, stabilizes the c-Myc protein, and, through that, promotes cancerogenesis. An increase in CIP2A expression has been observed in numerous solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical impact of the functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the KIAA1524 gene (rs2278911, 686C > T) in MM patients. Methods: The study group consisted of 128 patients with de novo MM. EDTA venous blood samples were collected prior to the treatment. The SNPs were analyzed by Real-Time PCR with the use of specific Taqman probes. Results: Multivariable analysis revealed that variables independently associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) included thrombocytopenia, delTP53 and IGH/CCND1 translocation and the TT genotype of the KIAA1524 gene (686C > T) (median PFS: 6 vs. 25 months; HR = 7.18). On the other hand, autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) was related to a lower risk of early disease progression. Moreover, light chain disease, International Staging System (ISS) 3, poor performance status, hypoalbuminemia, IGH/FGFR3 translocation and the TT genotype of the KIAA1524 gene (686C > T) were independent prognostic factors associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (median OS: 8 vs. 45 months; HR = 7.08). Conclusion: The evaluation of the SNP 686C > T of the KIAA1524 gene could be used as a diagnostic tool in MM patients at risk of early disease progression and death.",

            "text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant neoplasm characterized by the clonal proliferation of atypical plasma cells within the bone marrow, and accounts for around 10% of all hematologic malignancies [1]. The risk factors for MM include age, race, sex, family history, chronic inflammation, immunodeficiency and exposure to radiation and organic solvents [2\u20135]. Patients may experience a wide range of unspecific and usually mild symptoms, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and recurring infections [3]. At the time of presentation, 73% of the patients have anemia, almost 80% have osteolytic bone disease and 19% have acute kidney injury [6]. The imbalance between the osteoblasts\u2019 and\nCells 2023, 12, 1029. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12071029 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nCells 2023, 12, 1029 2 of 16\nthe osteoclasts\u2019 activity results in the development of bone lesions [7]. The progression of the disease leads to bone fractures, osteoporosis, multi-organ failure and death [3]. The current mainstay of MM treatment includes proteasome inhibitors (PI) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) known as monoclonal antibodies. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) remains the standard of care for young patients with newly diagnosed MM [7,8]. Although the introduction of new drugs has significantly improved the treatment\u2019s results, MM remains a disease with a very unpredictable course, with the estimated survival ranging from less than six months to more than 10 years [9]. The clinical outcome of MM is known to be affected by several factors, including the patient\u2019s performance status, age, comorbidities, therapy choice, microenvironment, tumor burden and characteristics of the tumor\u2014including the chromosomal changes and gene expression. However, even within the same risk groups, we observe a significant heterogeneity of the outcome [4,10,11]. The MM cells derive from B-line cells, which develop in the germinal centers located within the lymph nodes and the spleen. Malignant development begins with the acquisition of hyperdiploidy or translocation with the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene locus [4]. Based on the chromosome ploidy and other parameters, genetic abnormalities are divided into the hyperdiploidy karyotype, which is usually associated with translocations of IGH locus, and the hypodiploid karyotype, which is mostly linked to trisomies [12]. The first stage of the malignant transformation is the B cell\u2019s immortalization. One of the most common initiating mutations, observed in nearly 50% of MM patients, is a chromosomal translocation with the IGH locus at the 14q32 region, which may involve many other loci, such as 11q13, 4p16.3, 6p21, 16q23 or 20q11 [12,13]. Hyperdiploidy is present in 55% of MM patients and is associated with trisomies of chromosomes such as 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19 and 21 [12,14]. While trisomies 3 and 5 are beneficial for patients\u2019 survival, trisomy 21 is linked with poor prognosis [14]. The genomic instability promotes further molecular changes. The most common somatic mutations, which are present in around 50% of patients, occur in genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway, such as KRAS, NRAS and BRAF [4]. Other cytogenic changes have been described as secondary genetic aberrations, among which the most frequent are MYC rearrangements, del (13q), del (17p), (del)1p and amp(1q) [10,12]. These have been connected to MM progression. The signal pathways JAK2/STAT3, Ras/Raf, PI3K/AKT and NF\u03baB have been identified as those in control of MM cells\u2019 apoptosis, migration and proliferation, and may be linked to MM cells\u2019 drug resistance [15,16]. The interactions between MM cells and nonmalignant cells from the bone marrow microenvironment\u2014such as stromal and endothelial cells\u2014contribute to elevated levels of interleukin 6 (Il-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which promote the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway\u2019s activation [17]. As that signaling pathway regulates a wide range of MM\u2019s cellular processes, it is under intense research for targeting treatment [16,17]. So far, its role in the development of MMs has not been fully explained; however, in most other neoplasms, its activity is controlled by phosphatases such as PP2A (protein phosphatase 2). The KIAA1524 gene encodes the cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A)\u2014also known as a p90 tumor-associated antigen\u2014which is a human oncoprotein whose overexpression has been observed in patients with solid tumors of the head and neck, breast, stomach and large intestine [18]. The c-Myc stabilization in the tumor cells is promoted by the CIP2A thanks to its ability to inhibit the c-Myc protein\u2019s dephosphorylation, which is mediated by the activity of PP2A towards c-Myc serine 62 [18,19]. Additionally, CIP2A is also responsible for the downregulation of protein kinase B (Akt 9s) phosphorylation [20]. Myc and CIP2A appear to promote each other\u2019s expression in a positive regulatory loop [21]. As the inhibition of CIP2A may allow for the PP2A-mediated proteolytic degradation of c-Myc in cancer cells and thereby limit the cancer cells\u2019 growth and transformation, the CIP2A may be a promising candidate for targeted treatment [18,19].\nCells 2023, 12, 1029 3 of 16"

The influence of selected demographic, clinical and molecular variables on the risk of no response to chemotherapy was estimated by the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). In terms of the survival evaluation, the log-rank test was applied for the univariable analysis, whereas Cox regression models were used in the multivariable analysis. The influence of selected demographic, clinical and molecular variables on the risk of death was described by the hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% CI.

The backward elimination method was used for the selection of variables to be included in the results adjustment. Finally, in the multivariable PFS analysis, all results were adjusted by the following variables: gender, AHSCT, PLT, del17/TP53, t(11;14) IGH/CCND1 and KIAA gene genotype. On the other hand, in the multivariable OS analysis, all results were adjusted by diagnosis, performance status, anemia before treatment, t(4;14) IGH/FGFR3 and KIAA gene genotype. The progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the period between the start of the treatment and the occurrence of disease progression (complete data), or of the last documented follow-up (censored data).

Discussion MYC affects a number of metabolic pathways and plays a crucial key role in the development of MM. It plays a role in cycle regulation, proliferation, differentiation and metabolism of the cells, and its dysregulation has been shown to promote the transition from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to MM. Its activity can be regulated by its mutations, as well as by changes in pathways involved in its regulation (e.g., it may be controlled by mTORC1 and RAS on a post-transcriptional level) [28\u201330]. The two most important phosphorylation sites on MYC, responsible for its stabilization and degradation are Serine62 (S62), which stabilizes MYC and participates in the target gene selection when phosphorylated, and Threonine 58 (T58), which runs the MYC degradation when phosphorylated [30,31]. S62 is phosphorylated by the extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2, while the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) is responsible for the T58\u2032s phosphorylation, which can only be carried out after the S62\u2032s phosphorylation [30]. Before MYC can be delivered to and degraded by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system, it must be dephosphorylated in position S62 by PP2A [32,33]. CIP2A inhibits the PP2A, and, through that, stabilizes MYC [30,32]. Moreover, PP2A\u2019s inhibition increases ERK\u2019s activation and promotes cell proliferation and survival, as well as the expression of invasive proteases [30]. Since CIP2A also influences the RAS pathway, it may indirectly regulate the MYC pathway through its elements [34\u201336] The Ras proto-oncogene has been shown to enhance the ERK\u2019s activity, restrict the GSK-3\u2019s activity and affect the PI3K pathway-mediated T58\u2032s phosphorylation, making it a MYC stabilizer [30]. In addition, the mutations in MYC ubiquitin ligase (FBW7) may prevent the MYC\u2019s degradation, and the ubiquitin-specific protease USP28 has been shown to contribute to the MYC stabilization in neoplastic cells.\nFigure 5.

In addition, the mutations in MYC ubiquitin ligase (FBW7) may prevent the MYC\u2019s degradation, and the ubiquitin-specific protease USP28 has been shown to contribute to the MYC stabilization in neoplastic cells. RalA is a Ras effector, and its phosphorylation is also an important element of PP2Amediated tumor suppression [30]. Altogether, MYC\u2019s activity is regulated not only by\nCells 2023, 12, 1029 11 of 16\nCIP2A, but also by a number of other factors. The complexity of these regulatory systems would justify the intermediate, positive correlation we observed between the expression of the KIAA1524 gene and the MYC gene (rho = 0.515; p = 0.0345) (Figure 2B). Nevertheless, CIP2A is not the only factor capable of changing the PP2A\u2019s activity. GFI-1 has been shown (growth factor independence-1) to inhibit the SGPP1 (sphingosine1-phosphate phosphatase 1) gene transcription, leading to increased S1P (sphingosine-1phosphate) synthesis. This resulted in a S1P/Ceramides ratio imbalance, triggering the PP2A inactivation and, as a consequence, c-Myc stabilization in the MM cells [33]. Such interactions must be considered when judging the prognostic roles of KIAA1524 and CIP2A. In the case of the 686 SNP of the KIAA1524 (rs2278911) gene, when cystein becomes replaced by tymin, the 229th amino acid coded by the gene changes from arginine (Arg) to glutamine (Gln) [37]. Such an alteration has been shown to lower the charge and change the surface properties of the CIP2A\u2019s N-terminal domain, affecting the protein-to-protein interactions [34]. In addition, Preuss et al. found that certain modifications within the B subunit affected PP2A\u2019s activity towards its targets [38]. A research paper by Wang et al. [35] revealed that, with its N-terminal (amino acids 1\u2013560), CIP2A could bind directly to the B56\u03b1 and B56\u03b3 subunits of the PP2A protein\u2014both of which are tumor suppressor units\u2014and that the region necessary for this was located between the amino acids 159 and 245 and positively charged. Moreover, the researchers found that changing the 230th (asparagine\u2014neutrally charged) nucleotide to a negatively charged glutamic acid led to decreased binding of CIP2A to the B56\u03b1, and concluded that the B56 subunit was most likely to bind to a positively charged surface of the CIP2A [35]. In our study, the presence of the TT genotype of the KIAA1524 gene (rs2278911) had an independent prognostic value, with the afflicted patients being over seven times more likely to experience PFS and OS reduction compared to the carriers of other variants. Since the 686C > T alteration resulted in an exchange of a positively charged amino acid for a neutral one, it seems that in order to explain the TT genotype\u2019s correlation with worse prognosis, we must search beyond the currently known direct CIP2A-PP2A interactions. In a paper published in 2014, three years before Wang\u2019s publication, Puustinen et al. wrote that the mechanism in which CIP2A modulated the mTORC1-related PP2A activity was most likely that of an allosteric inhibitor, and stipulated that it was more likely to affect the substrate availability rather than the enzyme\u2019s activity [39]. In 2021, Laine et al. discovered that poor clinical outcomes in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) patients was related to high CIP2A expression and not to the alterations in its gene\u2019s sequence. They also established that CIP2A expression was upregulated by the DNA-PF/CHK1 activity, TP53 inactivation and EGFR pathway activation [40]. As we have also observed a significantly lower expression of CIP2A among patients with the CC genotype, we would stipulate that that the consequences of indirect CIP2A-mediated PP2A modulation may outweigh the effects of the direct PP2A-binding, and that the most likely cause for the reported outcome\u2013 SNP correlation is, in fact, altered CIP2A expression. Our results would also align with a finding by Li et al., who speculated that Arg229Gln altered the CIP2A expression [37]. A number of drugs [41\u201345] have shown the ability to influence KIAA1524, CIP2A or their affected pathways. Bedewy and Elmaghraby observed that MM patients had higher CIP2A expression, which decreased during bortezomib treatment. Furthermore, higher CIP2A levels were correlated with a worse response to bortezomib, as well as with shorter PFS [45]. The research on KIAA1524 and CIP2A as potential treatment targets is ongoing, but in order for it to progress, many obstacles must be overcome. One of the biggest issues we are currently facing is a very convoluted net of CIP2A\u2013 PP2A interactions, which may be affected by a number of factors and has yet to be fully explored [34,46\u201348], as well as the partially contradicting data on the matter. A high CIP2A concentration has been found to serve as a negative prognostic factor in a number of human cancers [35], and CIP2A knockdown has been shown to inhibit the activity of MYC, E2F1 and Akt [30]; restrict tumor growth in oral cancer mice models [47] and result in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of human MM cells [48]. However, such results\nCells 2023, 12, 1029 12 of 16\ncould not be achieved in all tumor types [46]. Additionally, although there seems to be a general consensus that CIP2A-mediated PP2A inhibition supports MM development, we did come across some research which pointed towards an oncogenic role of PP2A. In 2001 Kang and Chou found that PP2A regulated the ROI (reactive oxygen intermediates) levels within MM cells, which promoted the expression of IL-6 and BCL-2, thus supporting the MM\u2019s development [49]. Three years later, Mitsuthashi et al. demonstrated that PP2A prevented the degradation of the glycoprotein 130 (also known as IL-6 signal transducer). The researchers observed that bortezomib-mediated gp130 degradation provoked the MM cells\u2019 apoptosis by decreasing their sensitivity to the IL-6 [50]. In 2021, Slomp et al. found that PP2A reversed the dephosphorylated and stabilized MCL1 (induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein) in MM [45]. Based on data from the CoMMpass, we identified 30 candidate genes, the regulation of expression of which may be related to KIAA: AC069499.1, MYH15, HNRNPR, KIF11, CENPI, USP1, CEP78, AMMECR1, RRM1, PLK4, TMPO, SMC4, SGO1, CEP55, BUB1, OSBPL11, KIF4A, CAPG, SPAG5, INCENP, POLA1, CDK1, ZWINT, SMC2, PCNA, SPATA5, NCAPG2, GPSM2, NCAPH and TOP2A. Disturbances in their expression have been the subject of many studies on the pathogenesis of solid tumors, e.g., lung, breast, endometrial, stomach and colon cancer [51\u201368]. Interestingly, these include genes encoding centromeric proteins (CENPI) [51]; centrosomal proteins (CEP55, CEP78) [52,62]; motor proteins (MYH15, KIF11) [53,54] involved in the construction of the karyokinetic spindle or proteins regulating cell division processes (PLK4, SGO1, BUB1, KIF4A, NCAPG, SPAG5, INCENP, CDK1, ZWINT, NCAPG2, GPSM2, NCAPH and TOP2A) [55,60,63,66\u201373]; and genes encoding proteins involved in DNA repair processes (USP1, RRM1, KIF4A, POLA1 and PCNA) [58,59,65,74,75], which are defined as oncogenes (SPAG5, SMC2) [67,76]. In the context of multiple myeloma, the expression of the HNRNPA2B1, USP1, RRM1, SPAG5, PCNA and TOP2A genes has been studied. It has been proven that HNRNPA2B1 increases the stability of mRNA transcripts for interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3), and its overexpression induces cell proliferation through the AKT3 kinase. Increased HNRNPA2B1 gene expression is associated with an unfavorable prognosis [57]. The USP1 protein leads to regulated DNA repair through deubiquitination and homologous recombination pathways, and inhibits cell differentiation by stabilizing tumor-promoting inhibitors of DNA-binding proteins. Inhibition of USP1 has been shown to reduce myeloma cell viability, inhibit the growth of multiple myeloma cells and overcome bortezomib resistance [58]. Higher expression of the RRM1 gene is associated with shorter overall survival. A blockade of the RRM1 gene results in the upregulation of DNA damage response genes and p53-regulated genes, thereby inhibiting the growth and promoting apoptosis of myeloma cells and cells of the bone marrow microenvironment [59]. SPAG5 gene expression correlates with myeloma cell malignancy, and SPAG5 overexpression is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. In vitro, knockdown of the SPAG5 gene leads to anti-MM effects, cell growth arrest and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [67]. The PCNA gene encodes a multifunctional protein which is essential for DNA replication and repair and is overexpressed in myeloma cells. PCNA inhibition induces apoptosis and sensitizes cells to melphalan, a common anti-myeloma drug [75]. TOP2A has been demonstrated to be another potential target for anti-myeloma therapy. It has been observed that overexpression of TOP2A topoisomerase in myeloma cells is associated with resistance to proteasome inhibitors [77]."
