Introduction With the enhancement of people's health awareness, the requirements for the living environment are also continuously improved, and we gradually realize that bacteria exist in all aspects of our daily life and are one of the microorganisms that humans are in close contact with. Bacteria are not only the main participants in the material cycle of nature, but also play an important role in human body functions. However, the problem of microbial contamination caused by bacteria and fungi in global environmental pollution cannot be ignored. Due to the high adaptability of microorganisms, it has always been challenging problem to e ciently remove harmful microorganisms in environments such as drinking water treatment, food processing, medical device manufacturing or textile industry (X. Qu et al. 2013; P. J. Vikesland et al. 2010; P. Hajipour et al. 2021). Even with the rapid development of science and technology, research on antibacterial agents that inhibit the growth and reproduction of pathogenic microorganisms is still a crucial task, so photocatalytic antibacterial materials have emerged as the times require. Photocatalytic antibacterial materials are a kind of antibacterial materials (M. Surapaneni et al. 2015). Inorganic antibacterial materials have many advantages such as long-lasting antibacterial and environmental protection (J. Z. Sun et al. 2013). The composite antibacterial material refers to the composite material of two or more kinds of antibacterial materials combined together to form a composite material with more excellent antibacterial effect. At present, the eld of composite photocatalytic materials has been well developed because of their better photocatalytic performance,\nPage 3/31\nhigher light utilization, and better chemical stability compared with single catalytic materials (S. Liang et al. 2019; J. W. Xu et al. 2014; S. Ghafoor et al. 2018; H. Yang et al. 2018; P. Huang et al. 2019; M. Gratzel. 2018).\nAmong all photocatalytic antibacterial materials, n-type ZnO has been widely studied in photocatalytic applications due to its unique electronic structure and suitable properties, and is a new type of antibacterial material (C. S. Cunha et al. 2020; L. Hu et al. 2019; R. Singh et al. 2019; O. O. Ozdemir et al. 2020). However, ZnO has certain defects, such as a wide bandgap around 3.2 eV, which makes the activity of ZnO limited to the ultraviolet region and not active in the visible region (V. Kumar et al. 2017; A. Aditya et al. 2018; K. Qi et al. 2019; A. Rahman et al. 2021). But this defect can be ameliorated by doping or forming composites with narrow bandgap materials (M. Yan et al. 2017; Z. L. Wang et al. 2004; V. E. Podasca et al. 2016; T. Wang et al. 2018; E. Rokhsat et al. 2016).\nIn the past ten years, due to the advantages of narrow band gap, low price, and wide light absorption range, bismuth-based photocatalytic materials have entered people's eld of vision as a visible light catalytic material with excellent performance (R. J. Ma et al. 2018; C. Wu et al. 2019; M. R. Kamli et al. 2021). There has been signi cant research progress in theoretical research and practical application of bismuth-based photocatalytic materials (R. A. Rather et al. 2020). The research on binary and multicomponent bismuth-based photocatalytic composite materials has gradually deepened, and its application in various elds has gradually become wider. However, there is still no systematic conclusion about its speci c photocatalytic mechanism, and the research on the reaction mechanism and energy band structure of bismuth-based photocatalytic composites still needs to be strengthened. In 2019, researchers synthesized \u03b2-AgVO3/BiVO4 composite visible light catalytic antibacterial material. After being excited by visible light irradiation, \u03b2-AgVO3/BiVO4 composite material showed strong resistance to P. aeruginosa (Z. B. Xiang et al. 2019). The photocatalytic antibacterial activity, which can be attributed to the formation of a heterojunction structure in the \u03b2-AgVO3/BiVO4 composite, greatly improves the separation degree and lifetime of photogenerated charges in the composite (Z. B. Xiang et al. 2019). In 2018, Jingfei Luan et al. synthesized BiSnSbO6, which has a pyrochlore structure and has photocatalytic degradation activity for BZT and RhB under visible light irradiation (J. F. Luan et al. 2018). The surface of pyrochlore structural materials has more oxygen vacancies, which can improve the photon e ciency, and has shown great potential in the eld of photocatalysis applications. However, the problem of Bi-based photocatalytic material BiSnSbO6 is that it can only absorb and utilize visible light, which greatly reduces its application range and limits its application.\nIn this work, a simple solid-phase sintering method was used to synthesize BiSnSbO6 materials, and then different ratios of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were prepared by changing the molar ratio. The crystal structure characteristics and photoelectric properties of the prepared BiSnSbO6ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were investigated by XRD, EDS, SEM, EIS and other characterization methods. E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans were used as model bacteria, to explore the antibacterial activity of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material under\nPage 4/31\nLED light illumination. Using L929 cells as model cells, in vitro cytotoxicity experiments were carried out. In order to understand the reasons for the enhanced antibacterial activity of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials, the photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism was explored through SEM observation of bacterial surface morphology and free radical scavenging experiments, and the structure and reactive oxygen generation of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were analyzed relationship. Finally, the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and practical applicability of the composite material were determined by the livestock and poultry wastewater collected in real life.\n2. Experimental Section\n2.1. Materials E. coli (ATCC 25922), S. aureus (ATCC 6538), P. aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) used in this experiment were from the China Culture Collection Center. The LB medium was used as the nutrient source for bacteria, and the Martin medium was used as the nutrient source for fungi. Bi2O3, SnO2, Sb2O5, ZnO and NaCl were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Company. Agar, Glutaraldehyde, and Isoamyl Acetate were from Obersin Biotechnology. 2.2. Preparation of BiSnSbO6 The solid phase sintering method is used. Mix Bi2O3: SnO2: Sb2O5 in a molar ratio of 1:2:1 (P. Huang et al. 2019), put the materials in an agate mortar and mix and grind, and dry for 4 h. Put the ground powder into a corundum crucible and put it into a high temperature mu e furnace for calcination. The calcination temperature changed as follows: 80 min from 20\u00b0C to 350\u00b0C, hold for 240 min, 80 min to 720\u00b0C, hold for 240 min, and nally 60 min from 720\u00b0C to 900\u00b0C, hold for 1500 min. 2.3. Preparation of BiSnSbO6-ZnO Composite The rst step was to weigh and mix BiSnSbO6 and ZnO in a certain molar ratio. The second step was to grind the mixed material. The third step was to put the powder into a corundum crucible and press it into a cake, paying attention to the thickness. Finally, it was put into a high temperature mu e furnace for calcination. The BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was obtained by maintaining the heating rate of 4.4 \u2103/min for 200 min, heating up to 900 \u2103, holding at 900 \u2103 for 1500 min, and cooling to room temperature after calcination. BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were prepared by changing the molar ratio of 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5, respectively. 2.4. Characterization The material crystal structure was tested using Cu ka radiation XRD (Rigaku Smart-Lab). SEM (Regulus 8100), TEM (H-8100EM) and EDS (Bruker XFlash 6l60) were used to understand the microscopic morphology and elemental composition of the samples for characterization.\nPage 5/31\nPhotoelectrochemical tests: The light absorption capacity of the photocatalytic materials was analyzed by UV-vis DRS (Varian Cary 500). EIS and PT tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E). 2.5. Photocatalytic antibacterial performance experiment The photocatalytic antibacterial activities of the composites against E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans were determined by plate colony counting method. All glassware were sterilised at 121\u00b0C for 20 min before the experiments were carried out. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Materials with different experimental concentrations are set for experiments. Too low or too high experimental concentrations are not conducive to the photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, it is particularly important to choose the most excellent concentration of antibacterial. In this experiment, four different concentrations were set from low to high, and the concentrations of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were 125 mg/L, 250 mg/L, 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L, respectively. Weigh samples of different masses and add them to beakers, add 0.9% NaCl solution to dilute, and ultrasonically disperse them evenly. Pipette the bacterial solution from the cultured bacterial solution and add it to the beaker containing the sample, so that the bacteria and the material are fully contacted. A 35W LED light was used as the light source to irradiate vertically downward, and the stirring was maintained at a xed speed throughout the experiment. Bacteria were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 18 h, fungi were cultured at 28\u00b0C for 48 h, and the colonies on the medium were counted to calculate the photocatalytic antibacterial rate. 2.6. In vitro cytotoxicity assay The biosafety of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic antibacterial materials was tested by in vitro cytotoxicity experiments, and normal mouse skin broblasts (L929) were selected for cytotoxicity detection of different materials. About 5000 cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate, cultured for 12 h, and 100 \u00b5L of material solutions of different concentrations were added to each well. After 24 hours of culture, 10% MTT solution was added, and the culture was terminated after 4 hours. After that, DMSO was added. The absorbance (OD) was measured at 490 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to calculate the cell viability. 2.7. SEM study of bacterial surface morphology SEM study was used to observe the differences in structure and morphology of bacteria and fungi treated with and without materials under light conditions, which more intuitively explained the in uence of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials on the production of pathogenic microorganisms. Bacterial samples were xed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution, washed with PBS, dehydrated with different concentrations of ethanol gradient for 15 min/time, and nally replaced with isoamyl acetate twice, 20 min each time. After freeze-drying at -80 \u2103, the bacteria suspension was made with ethanol and added dropwise to the silicon wafer to observe the morphological difference of bacteria. 2.8. Photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism research\nPage 6/31\nIn order to further explore the photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials, radical scavenging experiments were carried out. S. aureus was used as a model bacterium to study the active substances that play a major role in the photocatalytic antibacterial process. During the experiment, different free radical scavengers were added to remove the generated ROS. BQ, IPA, Na2C2O4 and K2Cr2O7 were used as scavengers of \u2022O2\u2212, \u2022OH, h+ and e\u2212, respectively. 2.9. Application of composite photocatalytic materials in livestock and poultry wastewater In order to test the antibacterial properties of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material in practical application, the livestock and poultry sewage from the farm was selected as the real water sample to verify the ability of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material to remove and kill bacteria in practical application. The BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was added to the centrifuged and diluted livestock and poultry sewage of the farm, treated with LED light, and then 100 \u00b5L was taken out and spread on a solid LB plate for 24 h. The antibacterial effect was also evaluated by colony counting method.\n3. Results And Discussion\n3.1. Structure and morphology characterizations Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials with different molar ratios. The crystal structures of BiSnSbO6, ZnO and BiSnSbO6-ZnO were characterized by XRD. In the ZnO spectrum, the characteristic peaks at 2\u03b8 = 31.1\u00b0, 34.0\u00b0, 35.6\u00b0, 47.0\u00b0, 56.0\u00b0, 62.3\u00b0 and 67.5\u00b0 correspond to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) crystal planes, the same as the ZnO standard card (PDF#01-0562), are wurtzite hexagonal phases (V. Kononenko et al. 2017; A. Sundararaj et al. 2017). The characteristic diffraction peaks located at 2\u03b8 = 29.4\u00b0, 34.0\u00b0, 48.9\u00b0, 58.0\u00b0, 60.8\u00b0 and 71.8\u00b0 correspond to (222), (400), (440), (622), (444) and (800) of BiSnSbO6 diffraction crystal plane, which is consistent with the literature report (J. F. Luan et al. 2018). Compared with the characteristic peaks at the molar ratios of 1:2 and 1:3, the characteristic peaks of the composites with the molar ratios of 1:4 and 1:5 are clearer and sharper, indicating that the composites with the molar ratios of 1:4 and 1:5 have higher crystallinity. In the spectrum of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material, both the characteristic peaks of BiSnSbO6 and ZnO appeared, which indicated that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was successfully synthesized.\nThe morphology, structure and elemental composition of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were analyzed by SEM, TEM and EDS. Figure 2(a) is an SEM image of BiSnSbO6, showing particles with random three-dimensional shapes. Figures 2(b) and (c) are the SEM and TEM images of the composite with a molar ratio of 1:4, respectively, while Figs. 2(d) and (e) are the SEM and TEM images of the composite with a molar ratio of 1:5. Figure 2(b) and (d) are the SEM pictures of BiSnSbO6-\nPage 7/31\nZnO composite photocatalytic material. It can be seen from the gure that the irregularly shaped BiSnSbO6 particles are attached to ZnO nanoparticles with smaller particle size, indicating that BiSnSbO6 and ZnO are successfully compounded together to form a BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material. From Fig. 2 (c), (e) BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material TEM pictures can be seen from the larger BiSnSbO6 particles and smaller diameter of ZnO. The results further proved that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials in 1:4 and 1:5 molar ratios were successfully composited. Among them, when scanning and observing the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials with a molar ratio of 1:2 and 1:3, it was found that the composite photocatalytic materials of these two ratios appeared material agglomeration. This phenomenon may be because BiSnSbO6 accounts for more. According to the literature, it can be known that BiSnSbO6 is prone to agglomeration when sintered at high temperature for a long time [30], so the 1:2 and 1:3 molar ratio composite materials were not used in the subsequent antibacterial experiments.\nThe BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was scanned by EDS to further verify whether the effective components in the composite material were evenly distributed during the material composite process. Scanning the marked area of the SEM image, all elements (Bi, Sn, Sb, Zn and O) are uniformly distributed in the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material as shown in Fig. 3. It shows that BiSnSbO6 and ZnO are successfully coupled to form BiSnSbO6-ZnO composites. 3.2. Antibacterial activity and in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation Using 35 W LED lamp as excitation light source, the photocatalytic antibacterial properties of pure BiSnSbO6 material, pure ZnO material and BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material were determined by colony counting method. Compared with pure BiSnSbO6 and ZnO materials, the antibacterial properties of BiSnSbO6, ZnO and BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials against E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans were compared. Firstly, the photocatalytic e ciency of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials with different molar ratios of 1:4 and 1:5 was compared with S. aureus as model bacteria, so as to determine the optimal composite material ratio for subsequent experiments.\nUsing a control group without catalytic materials in a light environment, the effect of LED light on the inhibition or killing of pathogenic microorganisms was removed. Set up a dark group with catalytic materials in a dark environment, and test whether the materials themselves have the ability to inhibit or kill microorganisms. Provided 35 W LED lighting simultaneously under the same ambient conditions. Using S. aureus as model bacteria, the antibacterial ability of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials at different ratios and concentrations against S. aureus was compared. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material with a molar ratio of 1:4 achieved 100% antibacterial e ciency against S. aureus at 4 h. The antibacterial e ciency against S. aureus is higher than that of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material with a molar ratio of 1:5.\nPage 8/31\nTherefore, the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material with the best molar ratio of 1:4 was selected for the subsequent experiments.\nFigure 5(a) shows the photocatalytic antibacterial e ciency of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material with different concentrations of 1:4 molar ratio on E. coli. In the antibacterial process, the best antibacterial e ciencies of single BiSnSbO6 and ZnO against E. coli within 6 h were 67.46% and 28.57%, respectively, indicating that both BiSnSbO6 and ZnO have a certain inactivation effect on E. coli under LED light, but the effect is not ideal, and different concentrations of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials have better antibacterial properties than single BiSnSbO6 and ZnO. After 6 h of light irradiation, 500 mg/L BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material had the highest antibacterial e ciency against E. coli, reaching 99.63%. Figure 5(c) is a graph showing the antibacterial e ciency of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material against S. aureus. It can be seen that the highest antibacterial e ciencies of the monomers BiSnSbO6 and ZnO are 21.60% and 84.79% respectively within 6 h, and the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material exhibits better antibacterial properties. The antibacterial e ciency of the catalytic material reached 100% at 4 h. NanoZnO has been shown to be selectively toxic to S. aureus, and the experimental results are consistent with the reported literature (L. R. Zheng et al. 2012). Figure 5(e) is a graph showing the antibacterial e ciency of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material against P. aeruginosa. Compared with the monomers BiSnSbO6 and ZnO, the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material exhibited stronger antibacterial properties against P. aeruginosa, It can be clearly seen that the antibacterial e ciency of the 500 mg/L BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material against P. aeruginosa reached 100% when the light was irradiated for 4 h. Compared with the antibacterial e ciency of other different concentrations, the antibacterial e ciency of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material at a concentration of 500 mg/L is better, indicating that the optimal antibacterial concentration of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material for bacteria is 500 mg/L. Too much concentration or too little concentration will affect the photocatalytic activity of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material. Figure 5(b), (d), (f) are the antibacterial plate images of monomer BiSnSbO6, ZnO and BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials with different concentrations against E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.\nIn order to explore the antibacterial e ciency of materials with different concentrations, the antibacterial time of light exposure was extended to continue to observe. From Fig. 6, it can be found that at 12 h, the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials with four different antibacterial concentrations of 125 mg/L, 250 mg/L, 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L had better effects on E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa three bacteria were 100% antibacterial e ciency. It shows that under the condition of maintaining light conditions, the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material with different concentrations can also continue to exert antibacterial effect to kill bacteria.\nPage 9/31\nAccording to the above research results, it can be found that the optimal antibacterial concentration of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material for bacteria is 500 mg/L, but there are species differences in the antibacterial effect on different bacteria.\nIn order to understand the antibacterial properties of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials on fungi, this paper also used Candida albicans as model bacteria to conduct antibacterial experiments on fungi. Figure 7 showed the antibacterial e ciency diagram and antibacterial plate diagram of single BiSnSbO6, ZnO and BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials with different concentrations against Candida albicans. The antibacterial e ciency against Candida albicans reached the highest at h, which was 63.80%.\nThe cytotoxicity of antibacterial materials is of great signi cance for further practical applications of the materials. In this study, normal mouse skin broblasts (L929) were selected to detect the cytotoxicity of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials. According to the results of the previous antibacterial experiments, three different concentrations were set, which were 250 mg/L, 500 mg/L, and 1000 mg/L, respectively. Figure 8 showed the results of MTT assay. There was no signi cant difference in the survival rate of L929 cells between the three different concentrations of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material and the control group (p > 0.05). This can explain the non-cytotoxicity of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material. However, the survival rate of L929 cells incubated with monomeric ZnO at a concentration of 500 mg/L was signi cantly reduced, which was signi cantly different from that of the blank control group (p < 0.05). 3.3. Electrochemical Characterization Figure 9 showed the UV-vis DRS spectra of BiSnSbO6, ZnO and BiSnSbO6-ZnO. It can be seen from Fig. 9(a) that ZnO absorbs light with a wavelength below 400 nm, mainly absorbing ultraviolet light, and the absorption band edges of BiSnSbO6 and BiSnSbO6-ZnO are above 400 nm, indicating that they are responsive to visible light. With the addition of ZnO, the light absorption intensity of BiSnSbO6-ZnO was enhanced. The band gap energy (Eg) can be estimated according to the formula: hv = A(hv-Eg)n/2 (L. Yose et al. 2018; S. Y. Li et al. 2014). Since ZnO is a direct transition semiconductor material, n = 2 in the calculation process (R. Kumar et al. 2014). From Fig. 9(b), (c), (d), it can be concluded that the BiSnSbO6ZnO composite photocatalytic material, the forbidden band widths of BiSnSbO6 and ZnO materials are 2.81 eV, 2.66 eV and 3.14 eV, respectively. This is similar to the data reported in the previous literature (J. F. Luan et al. 2018). The EVB and ECB edge potentials of BiSnSbO6 and ZnO calculated according to the formula are shown in Table 1. According to the edge potentials of EVB and ECB, BiSnSbO6-ZnO composites belong to type II heterojunction structure composites.\nTable 1\nEg, EVB and ECB values of BiSnSbO6and ZnO photocatalytic materials\u00a0\nPage 10/31\nPhotocatalysts Eg (eV) EVB (eV) ECB (eV)\nBiSnSbO6 2.80 3.23 0.57\nZnO 3.14 2.83 -0.31\nSemiconductor photocatalytic materials can understand the interfacial mobility of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in semiconductor materials through electrochemical impedance, where the smaller the radius of the semicircle arc, the higher the charge transport e ciency of semiconductor photocatalytic materials. As shown in Fig. 10, compared with pure BiSnSbO6 and pure ZnO materials, BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material has the smallest arc radius, indicating that BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material has the smallest charge transfer resistance. Therefore, the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material has the strongest photocatalytic antibacterial performance.\nFigure 11 is the PT map of different photocatalytic materials under intermittent illumination conditions. The photocurrent of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material is stronger than that of the two single materials. The higher the photocurrent intensity, the faster the separation rate of electron-hole pairs. It shows that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material has better photocatalytic antibacterial e ciency than the single BiSnSbO6 and ZnO materials.\nPL analysis can study the process of photoinduced electron-hole pair migration, transfer and recombination in semiconductor photocatalytic materials. The PL spectra of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material and ZnO are shown in Fig. 12. After exciting the material with 469 nm light, it can be found that the material shows a strong emission peak in the range of 800\u2013900 nm, and the emission peak intensity of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material is lower than that of the pure ZnO material, indicating that the recombination rate of BiSnSbO6 and ZnO inhibited the charge recombination rate. It is further demonstrated that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material can reduce the charge recombination rate, thereby improving the photocatalytic antibacterial activity. 3.4. Understanding of the mechanism for antimicrobial activity In order to understand the role of different active substances in the antibacterial process of BiSnSbO6ZnO composite photocatalytic materials, the photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials was explored through radical scavenging experiments. BQ, IPA, Na2C2O4 and K2Cr2O7 were used as scavengers of \u00b7O2\u2212, \u00b7OH, h+ and e\u2212, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 13 that after adding BQ, the antibacterial e ciency against the model bacteria S. aureus was enhanced, reaching 100% in 1 h. This should be because the conduction band position of ZnO is -0.31 eV, which is more correct than E\u03b8O2/\u00b7O2\u2212 (-0.33 eV), so the e- on the conduction band of ZnO cannot combine with O2 to form \u00b7O2\u2212 (K. N. Abbas et al. 2017). After adding BQ, BQ cannot combine with \u00b7O2\u2212, and\nPage 11/31\nbecause BQ is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, it can interact with DNA, protein, mitochondria, etc. in cells, resulting in bacterial death (Y. Liu et al. 2009; H. L. Wong et al. 2017). This may be the reason why the antibacterial e ciency against Staphylococcus aureus was improved after adding BQ, indicating that \u00b7O2\u2212 was not generated during the photocatalytic antibacterial process. The valence band position of BiSnSbO6 is 2.81 eV, which is more correct than E\u03b8\u00b7OH/H2O (2.38 eV) (D. L. Jiang et al. 2017), so the h+ at the valence band of BiSnSbO6 can react with H2O to generate OH, and then react with bacteria. After adding IPA, the antibacterial e ciency decreased slightly, indicating that the role of \u00b7OH in the photocatalytic antibacterial process was almost negligible. When the Na2C2O4 solution was added, the antibacterial e ciency decreased, indicating that the effect of h+ was weak in the photocatalytic antibacterial process. After adding K2Cr2O7 solution, the antibacterial e ciency decreased to a large extent, which indicated that the active substance e\u2212 played a major role. The free radical clearing experiment shows that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material can generate ROS under light conditions, and \u00b7OH, h+ and e\u2212 all have certain antibacterial effects, of which e\u2212 plays the main antibacterial effect.\nIn order to more clearly understand the effect of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material on the morphological changes of bacteria and fungi. SEM was used to observe the morphology of experimental bacteria treated with added material light and the control bacteria only treated with light. From Fig. 14, it can be found that compared with the control group, the structures and shapes of bacteria and fungi treated with BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials are signi cantly different. E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans all exhibited wrinkled atrophy, rupture and irregular morphology to a certain extent, unlike bacteria that had not been treated with the material whose surface was intact. The results showed that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material contacted the surface of bacteria and fungi, causing the surface of bacteria and fungi to atrophy or even rupture, preventing bacteria and fungi from maintaining normal physiological activities until death.\nIn summary, it is found that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material produces active substances \u00b7OH, h+ and e\u2212 in the photocatalytic antibacterial process, \u00b7OH, h+ and e\u2212 all have a certain antibacterial effect, and the role of e\u2212 occupies the leading position. After the active substance is in contact with the bacteria, the structural integrity of the bacteria is destroyed, and the internal substances of the bacteria leak, thereby achieving an antibacterial effect. According to published studies, BiSnSbO6 and ZnO are p-type and n-type semiconductors, respectively (P. Huang et al. 2019; Z. H. Jaffari et al. 2019). At the same time, combining the UV-vis valence and conduction band positions of the two, it is concluded that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material is a type II heterojunction structure, as shown in Fig. 15. 3.5. Application of composite photocatalytic materials in livestock and poultry wastewater\nPage 12/31\nA variety of bacteria have been found in the collected livestock and poultry wastewater, and these bacteria are extremely harmful to humans and the environment. This serious problem needs to be solved urgently to protect the environment. The practical application of antibacterial properties of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials was tested with livestock and poultry wastewater. As shown in Fig. 16, after the livestock and poultry wastewater was treated by light with the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material with the optimal antibacterial concentration of 500 mg/L, with the increase of time, the colonies in the livestock and poultry wastewater diluted 20 times were obviously reduced or even disappeared. After 3 h of LED light illumination, the antibacterial rate of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material reached 99.41%. When the time was extended to 6 h, it was found that the bacteria had been completely killed. It is proved that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material has a good antibacterial effect on a variety of coexisting bacteria, which also shows that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material is a broad-spectrum antibacterial material, which can be applied in practical applications.\n4. Conclusion BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were synthesized by a simple solid-phase sintering method. XRD, EDS, EIS and other characterizations further proved that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was composed of BiSnSbO6 and ZnO, and the composite was successful and the structure did not change. Comparing the photocatalytic and antibacterial effects of composites with different molar ratios on pathogenic microorganisms under 35 W LED light. The results showed that the antibacterial effect was the best when the molar ratio of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite was 1:4 and the concentration was 500 mg/L. The antibacterial e ciency against E. coli at 6 h can reach 99.63%, and the antibacterial e ciency of 500 mg/L BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa can reach 100% under illumination for 4 h. With the prolongation of the illumination time, the antibacterial e ciency of the composite materials with different concentrations against the four bacteria can reach 100% in 12 h. It shows that under the condition of maintaining light conditions, the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials with different concentrations can continue to exert antibacterial effect to achieve good antibacterial effect. The antibacterial e ciency of 250 mg/L BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material against Candida albicans can reach 63.8% after 6 h of illumination. It can be seen that the composite photocatalytic material has better antibacterial effect on bacteria. In order to further elucidate the antibacterial properties of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials in practical applications, antibacterial experiments were conducted on livestock and poultry wastewater collected in daily life. The results show that the antibacterial rate of BiSnSbO6ZnO composite photocatalytic material to bacteria reaches 99.41% after 3 hours of LED light illumination, indicating that BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against bacteria and can be widely used in real life. According to the free radical scavenging experiment, SEM observation of the morphological changes of the bacteria after light treatment and analysis of the energy band structure, the prepared BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material can\nPage 13/31\ngenerate active species \u00b7OH, h+ and e\u2212 through light irradiation to achieve the purpose of sterilization, where e\u2212 Play the main role. Cytotoxicity experiments proved that the prepared BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was non-toxic at the experimental concentration, indicating that the BiSnSbO6ZnO composite photocatalytic material was a green, safe and e cient photocatalytic material with broad-spectrum antibacterial properties and species differences.\nDeclarations Acknowledgements\u00a0This work was supported by Development and Reform Commission of Jilin Province, China (2022C039-5), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21871246).\nAuthor contribution\u00a0All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
