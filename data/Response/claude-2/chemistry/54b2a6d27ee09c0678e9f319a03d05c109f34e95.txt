 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. In vivo efficacy studies of CDFHCD in mouse models of pancreatic cancer to demonstrate anti-tumor effects. This would help move CDFHCD towards clinical trials.

2. Combination studies of CDFHCD with standard chemotherapy drugs like gemcitabine or Abraxane to evaluate synergistic effects against pancreatic cancer. This could lead to improved treatment options. 

3. Further mechanistic studies on how CDFHCD targets cancer stem cells and signaling pathways like NF-kB, Wnt/Î²-catenin etc. This could reveal additional therapeutic targets.

4. Synthesis and evaluation of novel difluorinated curcumin analogs with improved efficacy over CDF. Structure-activity relationship studies could optimize the compounds. 

5. Formulation development studies to improve CDFHCD's pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and tumor targeting. Nanoparticles, liposomes or targeted delivery systems could be explored.
