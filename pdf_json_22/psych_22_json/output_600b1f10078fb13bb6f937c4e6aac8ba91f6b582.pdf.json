In addition, women are more likely to develop an anxiety and depression disorder, in comorbidity with a wide spectrum of diseases related to the immune system. In recent years, hydrogen-rich water has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent and intervene in stress-related disorders, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aims to analyze the effects of psychological treatment and a hydrogen-rich drink on the severity of anxiety and depression, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, the cortisol awakening response, and general health state in a sample of women with panic disorder. This is a completely randomized, placebo-controlled study. The treatment group simultaneously received psychological treatment and 1.5 L of hydrogenated water for three months, compared to the control group that received psychological treatment and placebo. The results show that the treatment group was not significantly better than the control group. But there was a further reduction in measured pro-inflammatory cytokine scores, improving body pain and physical health. When between-group treatment effects were removed, psychological treatment significantly decreased measured variables, including cytokines and cortisol. The results support the presence of a maladaptive inflammatory process in women with panic disorder."

Increasing the risk of later developing another AD and major depression, in comorbidity with other medical pathologies.2,3 In recent years, the interrelationships emerged between the gut microbiota (GM), the gut, the immune system, the endocrine system, and the brain known as the Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis (MGBA). As well as, its relationship with AD, depression, and gastrointestinal (GI) health; highlighting the fundamental role of inflammatory processes as a common mechanism of AD and chronic inflammatory diseases (CID).4\u20139 It is well known that chronic psychosocial stress, whether through psychological, emotional or physical threats, triggers harmful physiological and behavioral responses to mental health and GI, which are generally accompanied by dysregulated MGBA and a compromised immune system.5,9\u201311 The overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the consequent disproportionate release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol, could produce changes in GM generating a state of dysbiosis, which would increase the risk of bacterial translocation into the bloodstream. The immune system detects pathogenic bacteria and sends information to immune cells, triggering an inflammatory process that affects the intestine and the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, there is an inflammatory response mediated by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and harmful\nCorresponding author: psicosaludanabelen@gmail.com Telephone contact: +34 655468000 a\nFern\u00e1ndez-Serrano AB, Moya-Faz FJ, Giner Alegr\u00eda CA, Fern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez JC, Soriano Guilabert JF, del Toro Mellado M.

This maladaptive process results in the homeostatic imbalance of the MGBA, producing profound changes in anxiety-like behavior and a more depressed mood.5,6,9,12\u201318 Although research is limited, studies have found elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in AD.4,14\nIn recent years, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent and intervene in stress-related disorders, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; positively influencing the body without generating unwanted side effects.19\u201322 Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a natural element present in nature and in living beings, with the ability to mitigate the inflammatory response and excessive oxidative stress, generating neuroprotective effects in the brain.19,23 Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, HRW can spread rapidly through cells and tissues, protecting neuronal cells. It is capable of selectively deactivating harmful ROS, suppressing bacterial endotoxin, and restoring pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor Alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-1\u03b2.19,20,23,24 To our knowledge, there are no studies that have tested HRW in patients with AD. But if we start from the inflammatory hypothesis, preclinical research has discovered that H2 has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, since it improves resistance to stress by reducing the activity of the HPA axis and the inflammatory response, through the inhibition of corticosterone, IL- 6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1, as well as anxiety and depression behaviors, improving social interaction.19,22,25,26 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, they found that drinking 600ml of HRW improves mood and anxiety by reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.23 In a recent study they found that drinking 1.5 liters of H2 water for four weeks reduces the inflammatory response and cell death, promoting antioxidant capacity in adults over 30 years of age.27 Likewise, H2 is beneficial to normalize the activity of the GI system, attenuating GI symptoms (such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal distension, among others).28 This fact may be due to the fact that bacterial species of GM genetically have the ability to metabolize H2, affecting the state of GM.29,30 On the other hand, cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) is the treatment of choice due to its efficacy and safety in addressing AD and reducing stress.31 Through the restructuring of cognitive distortions associated with interpretations of events that initiate physiological responses related to stress, CBT could reduce the body\u2019s inflammatory response and the reactivity of the HPA axis.4 Although studies in this field are scarce, CBT is known to help mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 and diurnal cortisol levels; being able to become a beneficial strategy to attenuate the inflammatory levels of the organism and reestablish the communication of the MGBA.32\u201335\nStarting from this context and given that people who suffer from panic attacks live with an intense state of anticipatory anxiety due to the extreme fear of suffering, again, another panic attack.36 It constitutes a significant psychological stressor to study the inflammatory hypothesis and its effects on MGBA in women suffering from panic disorder (PD). One might think that a comprehensive intervention\ndirected at reestablishing the MGBA, can decrease the inflammatory response and normalization of the HPA axis; recovering more effectively the communication between both distal organs and, ultimately, the symptoms associated with anxiety and panic. The present study aims to: a) to study the therapeutic effects of CBT and an ARW drink, on the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the cortisol awakening response (CAR), and other psychological variables; b) and, to verify the inflammatory hypothesis by means of indicators of the function of the HPA axis (CAR) and inflammation (pro-inflammatory cytokines). As far as we know, this is the first study to evaluate a comprehensive treatment aimed at MGBA in women with PD."

The results do not show significant differences between the groups in the GSRS variable [(Bz M: 49.40, SD: 18.71), (AD M: 33.00, SD: 11.31), (Bz y AD M: 39.55, SD: 7.51), (No psichotropic drugs M: 44.29, SD: 8.55), F = 1.48; p < 0.25].\nTable 2 shows the results of the repeated measures factorial ANOVA for the clinical variables, which studies the effects of treatment in women in each group (TG and CG). As can be seen, the effects of treatment with HRW and CBT (TG) are practically null. Only greater differences were observed in the scores in the TG of the variables SF36-BP and SF36-PSC.\nFigure 2 shows the mean values of CAR measured before treatment.

            "text": "The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinical characteristics of women who come to mental health with\nHealth Psychology Research 4\na PD; and evaluate the effects of CBT and an HRW drink on the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), the cortisol response on awakening (AUCG) and the values of the subjective scales (PSS, STAI, BDI-II, GSRS, SF-36) from the perspective of the MGBA.\nIn the first place, and after analyzing the descriptive results of the clinical sample, it is striking that the women, in addition to having high symptoms of perceived stress, anxiety and depression, presented high scores of GI symptoms and a more deteriorated physical health, with significant levels of body pain. In fact, most of the patients had CID, whether it was allergic, autoimmune, hormonal and / or metabolic or in combination with each other. This would indicate that PD in women are frequently comorbid with CID, so typical of developed countries.8,14,66 There are many reports that show that dysregulation of the inflammatory response, as a consequence of an aberrant microbial structure, contributes to the development of a large number of CIDs.67,68 And now, inflammation is beginning to be associated with ATs, directly modulating affective behavior.14 At\nHealth Psychology Research 5\nthe same time, these medical conditions presented with migraines and back pain, which are usually common characteristics in the Spanish population with mood and anxiety disorders.69,70 And that, likewise, have been related to maladaptive inflammatory processes.71 About half of the patients showed harmful behavior patterns that could possibly be contributing to increased levels of inflammation and anxiety symptoms. It has been discovered that certain factors related to lifestyle have a negative impact on the communication of the MGBA with negative consequences on the GI system and on the immune response with manifestations in the CNS, such as the maintenance of anxiety\nHealth Psychology Research 6\nand depression.18,72\u201375 Tobacco and alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, poor sleep quality and the intake of psychoactive drugs could generate an inflammatory response in the intestine, affecting microbial quality and modifying GI function, influencing anxiety behavior.16,76\u201380 In addition, the participants exhibited an elevated CAR corresponding to a reactive HPA axis, with an increased cortisol concentration on awakening, relative to the second and third saliva samples. It seems that the patients have a clinical profile with characteristics related to a possible deregulated MGBA, where PDs and CIDs could be closely related to each other.4,5,8\nIn relation to the clinical variables, according to our results, the intervention with CBT and HRW did not show bet-\nter results in the subjective variables, compared to the CG that only received CBT. What can be seen in the TG is a greater increase in the body pain score (SF36-BP) and in the global mean of physical health (SF36-PSC), indicating an improvement in symptoms, although without statistical significance. Regarding the biological variables, likewise, the intervention with CBT and with HRW did not report statistically significant results. However, in this group there was a greater reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, showing a continuous pattern in all the parameters measured. Although the results were not statistically significant, possibly as a consequence of the small sample size, it is interesting to note that both the variables related to physical health and the pro-inflammatory cytokines obtained better scores in the results. It would be possible that CBT and HRW can generate more beneficial effects on the health of participants with PD, helping to restore the immune response. In fact, H2 has the ability to mitigate the inflammatory response through the reduction of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1.19,26,30 This inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines could be linked to decreased levels of body pain and increased physical health in patients with PD. In recent years, evidence has shown that certain pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in the initiation and maintenance of pathological pain, specifically IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1.71 ARH has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that help improve people\u2019s quality of life, without causing adverse effects on the body.22,25,26 In addition, GM has the genetic ability to assimilate and transform H2,29,30 facilitating intestinal fermentation and the increase of substances beneficial to health.81 However, the psychological variables were not better than the CG, probably because the treatment with HRW was not implemented long enough to influence the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, the understanding of the mechanisms of action of H2 is limited, although it can become an attractive strategy in disorders that share inflammatory mechanisms, due to its biological properties. But, it is necessary to define the appropriate mode, frequency and time of administration to ensure the therapeutic effects of treatment with HRW.29\nNow, if we eliminate the different types of treatment, according to the within-subjects analysis, the results show\nHealth Psychology Research 7\nstatistically significant effects in all the variables measured, both clinical and biological. It is clear that CBT is effective in improving the psychological processes involved in reducing stress, anxiety and depression, being the treatment of choice for its efficacy and safety.1,31 But the most striking thing is that it is also capable of normalizing the reactivity of the HPA axis and the inflammatory response, through the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines; also contributing to improve symptoms related to body pain, GI symptoms and physical health; which could help reestablish MGBA communication. Research has shown the efficacy of CBT in reducing inflammatory processes and normalizing the HPA axis.4 It seems that the chronic inflammatory process is involved in the onset and maintenance of symptoms of anxiety and depression and, furthermore, it is common in CID.14,33,67,75 Based on our results, the inflammatory response could be modulated through cognitive restructuring, modifying irrational thoughts that activate physiological response mechanisms associated with stress. This would decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines and CAR, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects and less activation of the HPA axis; improving clinical psychological symptoms of anxiety and depression, and symptoms related to physical health.4,14,32,33,35\nHowever, this study had some limitations such as low statistical power, which may be influencing the fact that some of the results were not statistically significant. Furthermore, the effects of HRW could not be explained separately and the intervention was administered for a short period of time, so the results cannot assess the effect of HRW in the long term. Finally, the sample may not be representative since only two MHCs were recruited from the Region of Murcia. Also, there are other inflammatory factors not considered in this research that are important for future research, and that may be maintaining these disorders that are so frequent and comorbid with diseases related to the immune system (type of diet, sex, exposures to trauma, consumption of antibiotics, etc.).\nIn conclusion, our results show evidence of an associated inflammatory response in women with PD in comorbidity with CID, possibly due to a compromised immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to stressful stimulus. In addition to anxiety and depression, the sample presented GI symptoms, body pain and a more deteriorated physical health, together with unhealthy behavior patterns that may be contributing to the alteration of the MGBA and the increase in inflammation. Likewise, after the intervention, and although the effect of HRW was not significant, there was a greater reduction in all the pro-inflam-\nmatory cytokines measured and, when the effect between groups was eliminated, CBT significantly decreased both the psychological and biological variables, helping to restore the communication of the MGBA. To date, we did not have results on the effects of HRW and CBT in a clinical sample of women with PD and with a completely randomized design. The results would support the presence of a maladaptive inflammatory process in women suffering from PD. These data would be contributing, on the one hand, to broadening the etiopathogenic perspective of PD and, on the other hand, to promoting healthy lifestyles and implementing new therapeutic approaches in order to reduce inflammatory processes and reestablish MGBA communication."
