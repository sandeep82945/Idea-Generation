The portions of the text mentioning future research directions are:

1. "Future models should account for this effect."
2. "We propose that further research undertaken so that: • Data is collected specifically on solar PV adoption for new homes. • Data is collected to better understand the socio-psychological and economic drivers for adoption of those who build new homes, or that retrofit existing homes."
3. "We propose that research is undertaken in Australia to confirm and quantify this effect, as well as to further build this into the quantitative approach."
4. "There is an opportunity for more comprehensive modelling of the actor ecosystem."
5. "As a next step, because we have embedded our modelling into an ABM framework, it is also possible/recommended to further explore the impact of more complex interventions in the market, for example, innovations that support renters or apartment dwellers to more easily adopt solar PV systems, or to provide more targeted interventions for those constructing new homes."
