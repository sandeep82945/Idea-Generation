"While the strategy exhibited effectiveness for the initial days, with steady accumulation of thiosulfate, there was a significant subsequent decline of 60% in the thiosulfate concentration up to 2.0 g S2O32− L−1 on day 31. The decline in thiosulfate levels within the bioreactor serves as a clear indicator of its utilization as an energy source [62,63]. Bacteria capable of utilizing sulfide ions (HS−) for growth can also harness thiosulfate for their metabolic energy needs [62,64]. Transitioning the bioreactor into a batch mode prompted the accumulation of biomass, prompting these microorganisms to explore alternative energy sources in addition to sulfide ions. Consequently, thiosulfate emerged as a viable energy source under these conditions [62]. Additionally, it is important to highlight that a reduced presence of sulfide ions relative to the bacterial population correlates with diminished thiosulfate levels [65]. This correlation arises due to the chemical reactivity of sulfide, resulting in the formation of stable polysulfide compounds, which subsequently lead to thiosulfate production [65–67] In an attempt to mitigate the observed decline, the introduction of oxygen into the bioreactor was ceased (Stage V). This intervention was implemented to curb the oxidation of accumulating thiosulfate to sulfate, which went from 0.006 g SO42− L−1 on day 24 to 0.333 g SO42− L−1 on day 35 as depicted in Figure 2. This correlation also gives support to the hypothesis that thiosulfate has been employed by the bacterial consortium as an energy source once the bioreactor started to operate in batch mode. Unfortunately, the outcomes of this intervention proved to be unsatisfactory, as they failed to elevate the thiosulfate concentration in the bioreactor, which reached 2.1 ± 0.17 g S2O32− L−1, even following an extended period of 10 days."

This section suggests that future research could focus on addressing the decline in thiosulfate concentration observed when the bioreactor operates in batch mode, potentially by exploring alternative strategies to prevent the oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate and to maintain or enhance thiosulfate production for effective PGM recovery.
