    "abstractText": "The classification of olive oils and the authentication of their biological or geographic origin are important issues for public health and for the olive oil market and related industries. The development of techniques for olive oil classification that are fast, easy to use, and suitable for online, in situ and remote operation is of high interest. In this study, the possibility of discriminating and classifying vegetable oils according to different criteria related to biological or geographical origin was assessed using cyclic voltammograms (CVs) as input data, obtained with electrochemical sensors based on carbonaceous nanomaterials and gold nanoparticles. In this context, 44 vegetable oil samples of different categories were analyzed and the capacity of the sensor array coupled with multivariate analysis was evaluated. The characteristics highlighted in voltammograms are related to the redox properties of the electroactive compounds, mainly phenolics, existing in the oils. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of the oils\u2019 hydrophilic fraction was also estimated by conventional spectrophotometric methods (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and galvinoxyl) and correlated with the voltammetric responses of the sensors. The percentage of DPPH and galvinoxyl inhibition was accurately predicted from the voltammetric data, with a correlation coefficients greater than 0.97 both in calibration and in validation. The results indicate that this method allows for a clear discrimination of oils from different biological or geographic origins.",

            "text": "The olive (Olea europaea L.) is an ancient crop in Mediterranean countries and has been spread throughout all five continents. The reason for its worldwide diffusion is related to the high value of its oils, which are used in human consumption and have been demonstrated to be highly beneficial for human health [1]. Olive fruits are very nutritious and their use together with the leaves in medicine dates back to ancient times [2]. Clinical data prove the beneficial properties of olive oil as a nutrient that reduces the risk of heart, skin or prostate diseases, as well as the risk of gastrointestinal cancer, etc., and it is included as an ingredient in numerous pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations [3]. The assessment of virgin olive oil (VOO) quality and the classification into different categories is based on the following criteria: acidity, peroxide value, UV absorption and organoleptic evaluation [4]. On the basis of these criteria and taking into account the process of obtaining the various varieties of oil, the EU defines six main types of oils, which are delineated also by The International Olive Council (IOC) [5], in Article 118 of European Commission (EC) Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 [6]. The specific characteristics of each type of oil are shown in Table S1. The quality of the seed oils is established according to the Codex Standard for named vegetable oils 210 (Amendment 2005, 2011, 2013 and 2015) [7]. In the case of extra virgin sunflower oil, the technological process includes the cold extraction of the oil, which is suitable for human consumption without refining.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3010. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24033010 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3010 2 of 17\nOf the many commercial categories that exist for olive oil, EVOO has particularly high standards in terms of composition as well as sensory characteristics as assessed by recognized panels [8]. Chemically, it is a complex food composed mainly of triglycerides, accounting for 98% of the total composition and a number of minor constituents that are of crucial importance in terms of health benefits and sensory properties [9]. This fraction of minor compounds includes free fatty acids [10], monoglycerides [11], diglycerides [12], phenols [13], tocopherols [14], sterols [15], phospholipids [16], waxes [17], squalene [17], hydrocarbons [18] and volatile compounds [19]. However, the phenolic compounds are the main compounds responsible for the flavor of EVOOs and as biomarkers of authenticity [20]. Furthermore, EVOO contains a high amount of phenolic compounds, which are the main agents responsible for resistance to auto-oxidation and photo-oxidation [21]. There are at least thirty-six structurally different phenolic compounds that have been identified in EVOO [22]. Not all of these compounds are present in every EVOO and there is variation in the concentration of phenolic compounds between olive oils [23]. Such variation in the phenolic fraction is the result of production factors, including the variety of olives [24], the region of olive cultivation [25], the agricultural techniques used for olive cultivation [26], the maturity of the olive fruit at harvest [27] and also the extraction, processing and storage methods [28]. The main phenolic compounds in olive oil are presented in Table S2. The quantitative determination of these compounds is usually performed according to the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu spectrophotometric method [29]. However, the method is less specific compared to chromatographic methods [30]. According to the literature, the most common analytical techniques used for the separation and determination of these phenolic compounds in olive oil to date are high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with ultraviolet (UV) or diode array detection (DAD) [31], mass spectrometry (MS) [32], gas chromatography coupled with MS [33], capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with UV or MS detection [34], nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [35], and infrared (IR) spectroscopy [36]. These methods have the disadvantage of being laborious [37], requiring a relatively long period of analysis and processing of the samples due to the complexity of the phenolic species [38]. Complementary innovative methods for the qualitative and quantitative determination of phenolic compounds are based on electrochemical sensors and biosensors [39\u201341]. The sensors and biosensors can be used for the detection of specific compounds or to obtain the chemical profile (\u201cchemical fingerprint\u201d) when an array of such sensors is used [42\u201344]. The array of sensors coupled with multivariate data analysis, electronic tongues, based on potentiometric, voltammetric or impedimetric sensors, have been successfully used for discriminating different types of oils, depending on their phenolic and sensory characteristics [45,46]. These features were used for the discrimination and classification of oils, and especially olive oils, as a function of quality, olive variety, bitterness or other sensorial characteristics, geographical origin, etc. [47,48]. An important category of electrochemical sensors and biosensors is based on carbonaceous nanomaterials and metal nanoparticles, which have a special affinity for the phenolic compounds [49]. These nanomaterials have high surface-to-volume ratios biocompatible with the phenolic compounds and enhance electron-transfer kinetics during electrochemical processes [50]. Therefore, these kinds of sensors and biosensors have excellent performance characteristics for the detection of phenolic compounds in complex samples. In this study, screen-printed electrodes based on nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, graphene and carbon nanofibers) modified with gold nanoparticles were used for the sensitive detection of phenolic compounds in oil hydromethanolic extracts. The synergic effects in the sensitive properties of nanomaterials increases the active area of sensors and improves the rate of electron transfer, increasing sensitivity. Electrochemical responses coupled with multivariate data analysis were used for discriminating and classifying vegetable oils according to different criteria, related to biological or geographical origin, or to establish correlations with antioxidant activity.\nInt.

The cyclic voltammograms were registered between \u22120.4 and 1.3 V and the scan rate was 0.1 V\u00b7s\u22121. No signal pretreatment was applied. All CVs were imported in Excel and the constant variable (potential values) was removed. The current values of all replicates and samples from the anodic scan were included in the input matrix. From the analysis of the CVs it was observed that the main differences between the samples was in the anodic part. In order to respect the convention that in the data matrix the samples must be the lines and the variables the columns, the matrix containing the anodic current values was transposed. In this way, a matrix with 264 rows (44 samples \u00d7 6 replicates) and 480 columns (3 sensors \u00d7 160 current values) for the anodic part of CV was obtained. Multivariate data analysis was performed to determine if there were significant differences between the oils studied and for their classification as a function of type of oil, or country of origin (in the case of EVOOs). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the variables and discriminate into different classes. PCA is a multidimensional analysis that allows the transformation of the original variables into new ones, called principal components. The role of principal components is to explain the maximum amount of variance with the smallest number of components [59,60].

Scan rate: 0.1 V\u00b7s\u22121.\nIt can be seen that each sensor has a particular response when immersed in a solution of the same extract. These differences among the responses of the three electrodes is attributed to the redox activity of the phenolic compounds present in the sample to be analyzed [65], the oxidation and reduction processes being facilitated differently by the modifying nanomaterials present in the sensitive elements of the sensors [66,67]. It was also observed that the highest intensity at which the oxidation peak occurs is obtained in the case of GPH-GNP/SPCE (276.22 \u00b5A), while the intensity at which the reduction peak occurs is higher in the case of CNF-GNP/SPCE (\u221298.16 \u00b5A). These increases in oxidation and reduction current intensity could be attributed to the association of nanomaterials CNT, GPH and also CNF with GNP, achieving a synergistic effect and contributing to increase the conductivity of the electrodes and the electron transfer rate, thus increasing the sensitivity of the sensors [68,69]. Therefore, the three sensors immersed in the same extract solution provide complementary chemical composition information and the CVs are chemical fingerprints of the analyzed samples.

At the same time, a shift of oxidation peak potentials towards lower values is observed with increasing polyphenolic compounds content [70]. The results shown in Figure 2 indicate that the nature and concentration of the compounds found in different classes of oils give rise to a variety of electrochemical signals that can be used to discriminate between different types of oils. In particular, olive oils can be easily distinguished from seed oils due to their high polyphenol content [71]. Figure 3 shows the detection mechanism of mono- and di-phenolic compounds in the samples studied with voltammetric sensors. A single redox process is observed, involving the exchange of one electron and one proton in the case of mono-phenolic compounds, and the exchange of two electrons and two protons in a single step in the case of di-phenolic compounds, with the formation of the respective quinone derivative in both cases.\nFigure 2.

PCA scores plot corresponding to the CV data obtained with the sensors when these are exposed to EVOO samples from Italy, Spain, Greece and Tunisia.\nAnother principal component analysis was carried out to explore the structure of the data and the possibility of discriminating EVOO samples by country of origin. The scores plot of PCA based on the CVs of all voltammetric sensors immersed in the extracts of EVOOs is presented in Figure 5. In the PCA score plot, four distinct groups of EVOOs could be found, grouped according to country of origin (Figure 5). The members of the first group on the left side of the scores plot are olive oil samples from Italy. This group is well separated from the second group consisting of samples from Spain. The samples from Greece and Tunisia are separated from the other two categories and are found on the right side of the plot (at positive values of PC1). PC2 is very important in the discrimination of the EVOOs from Greece and Tunisia. All three PCs, which explain 95% of the variance, have the highest importance in the discrimination of the samples in agreement with EVOO country of origin, indicating that the geographical location had a great influence on the chemical composition of the olive oils. The PLS-DA technique, a supervised classification method that allows verification of the assignment of a sample to a particular group and calculation of the calibration and validation error, was used to confirm the groups observed in the principal component analysis. PLS-DA modeling involves two main procedures, PLS-DA component construction (dimension reduction) and prediction model construction (discriminant analysis). The output of the PLS-DA algorithms is the X-score (PLS-DA scores), which represents the original data X in a lower-dimensional subspace, and the predicted class membership matrix (Ypred), which estimates the class membership of the samples [64]. PLS-DA is used to optimize separation between different groups of samples, which is accomplished by linking two data matrices X (sensor data) and Y (classes of samples). PLS-DA aims to maximize the covariance between the independent variables X (sensors data) and the corresponding dependent variable Y (classes of samples) of highly multidimensional data by finding a linear subspace of the explanatory variables [62]. This\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3010 10 of 17\nnew subspace permits the prediction of the Y variable based on a reduced number of factors (latent variables, LV). These factors describe the behavior of dependent variables Y and they span the subspace onto which the independent variables X are projected [63]. For example, if the samples are divided into two different classes, then the variable Y will comprise a single vector, which will have an entry of 0 for all samples in the first class and an entry of 1 for all samples in the second class. When the data contain three classes, then the three groups will be binarily encoded in 3 variables with the Y matrix as [1 0 0] for all samples from class A, [0 1 0] for samples from class B, and finally [0 0 1] for samples from class C. This is the case for PLS-DA taking into account the type of oil: EVOO, POO and SFO. Figure 6 shows the PLS-DA scores plots developed from the same data used for PCA (X matrix), and the dependent variables were the classification criteria observed in PCA scores plots (Y matrix): type of oil (Figure 6a) and country of origin (Figure 6b), respectively. The random test cross-validation method was used to validate the models. In this method, the training and test samples are randomly selected. The random test was performed for 100 runs by removing 2 randomly selected samples. The optimal number of latent variables (LV) was determined according to the minimum predicted residual error sum of squares. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 18\nFigure 6.

The assay was carried out by adding volumes of 1 mL extract solution to 3 mL 0.1 mM DPPH ethanolic solution in the spectrophotometer cuvettes and then measuring the absorbance at \u03bb = 517 nm towards ethanol. For the application of the galvinoxyl method for the analysis of oil samples, volumes of 1 mL extract solution were added to 3 mL 0.1 mM galvinoxyl solution in the spectrophotometer cuvettes and the absorbance for each sample was then measured at 860 nm towards ethanol after 20 min [73]. For both methods, the percentage of DPPH inhibition and the percentage of galvinoxyl inhibition were calculated according to the following equation [74]:\n%Inhibition = (\nAD \u2212 AE AD\n) \u00d7 100\nwhere AD is the absorbance of the control solutions and AE is the absorbance of the test solutions. The % inhibition results obtained by both methods are shown in Table 3. All the analyses were carried out in triplicate and the average values are reported.

            "text": "In this study, models were developed for discriminating and classifying oil samples based on different criteria, using an electrochemical method based on SPE modified with different carbonaceous nanomaterials and GNP. The electrochemical signals were used as input variables in multivariate data analysis studies. At the same time, it was established that there was a very good correlation between the electrochemical responses of the sensors when immersed in solutions from the 44 oil samples studied and the data obtained from the DPPH and galvinoxyl spectrophotometric assays for the assessment of antioxidant activity. As a result of this study, it can be concluded that electrochemical sensors can be useful for the estimation of antioxidant activity of different types of oils, including EVOO, but also that they can be used for the discrimination and classification of vegetable oils. The use of sensors and biosensors in industry and quality control laboratories is still limited, even though these have numerous advantages and adequate sensitivity. Further studies will include biosensors capable of detecting biomarkers that could improve the performance of the analytical system for discrimination, classification or authentication. Thus, the development of databases using analytical information obtained by electroanalytical methods, together with the use of appropriate statistical tools could be useful in increasing the performance of systems for the quality control of EVOOs. Another research perspective would be the development of a lab-on-a-chip device useful in the routine analysis of olive oil at different stages of production, from harvesting to marketing, and also to analyse oxidative stability.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24033010/s1.\nInt.
