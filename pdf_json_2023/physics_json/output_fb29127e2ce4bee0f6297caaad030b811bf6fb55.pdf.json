How far this new index may take us will be discussed in this article.\n\u201cI believe the chemical bond is not so simple as some people seem to think\u201d \u2013 this famous quote from prime theoretician of his time, Robert Mulliken, says a lot.1 Aer three quarters of a century, Roald Hoffmann, over forty years older than his predecessor-in-science, reaffirms: \u201cThere is nothing more fundamental to chemistry than the chemical bond. But it\u2019s not a simple concept\u201d.2 And he says so despite the fact that enormous progress has been achieved in understanding chemical bonds of all avors during the decades that passed since Lewis rst drew, in 1902, his \u201ccubical atoms\u201d.3\nThe concept of \u201ccubical atoms\u201d by Gilbert N. Lewis, one of the founding fathers of the modern chemical bonding ideas,3 is now taught as the \u201coctet rule\u201d4 (or the \u201cdoublet rule\u201d for H, He and Li+like species). Despite its limitations, but thanks to its enormous simplicity, this approach has been used to qualitatively rationalize chemical bonding both in isolated molecules and in the solid state (e.g. via Zintl\u2013Klemm rules).5,6 It is hard to underestimate its importance for didactics of chemistry \u2013 counting to eight is hardly an obstacle for any pupil.\nMore complex ideas soon came with further advances in quantum chemistry. One of Pauling\u2019s rules, for example,\nf Warsaw,\nnd. E-mail:\nthe Royal So\nasserted that of two orbitals in an atom, the one that could overlap the most with an orbital from another atom would form the strongest bond.7 In this way, introducing overlap integrals, more features could be explained in a semiquantitative way, including the bond strengths of diverse chemical bonds. An even more quantitative approach was offered by Badger in 1934, who noticed that a simple relationship exists between internuclear distances and bond force constants.8 This rule, which was revisited numerous times by our community,9 opened a way to constructive dialogue between specialists in bond-length determination (e.g. via X-ray, neutron or electron diffraction), spectroscopists (vibrational spectra and bond dissociation energy determinations) and quantum chemists. The deviations from this rule are rare and therefore very interesting.\nSomewhat more complex situations are encountered in extended solids, particularly in three-dimensional coordination polymers, or in elemental metals and alloys. Here, unlike in most molecules, an atom may have a very complex bonding environment with several (usually up to a dozen) atoms found in its rst coordination sphere, at different interatomic separations, and with some secondary bonding too. It is impossible, in most cases, even in a Gedankenexperiment, or thought experiment, to\nciety of Chemistry\ndissociate only one of these bonds completely, leaving all others intact (and therefore to determine dissociation energy of one particular bond). Equally, separating a \u201clocalized oscillator\u201d from all others is virtually impossible. Clearly, the \u201cmetallic state\u201d gave trouble to Pauling, who departed from using integer numbers, and came up with an oversimplied and yet fuzzy description of chemical bonding in metals, including the simultaneous presence of M0, M+ and M\u2212 species in the crystal lattice in a peculiar proportion.10 In consequence, other descriptors of chemical bond strength have been used in such cases, including lattice energy (related to dissociation into isolated ions in the gas phase) or cohesive energy (dissociation into atoms in the gas phase). But these \u201ccollective properties\u201d hardly characterize an isolated bond within a solid. Therefore, the precise distribution of electronic density, which is these days accessible from X-ray diffraction, and the associated theoretical framework of atoms-in-molecules by Bader that permits separation of density into atomic basins,11 serves as a utile tool to characterize patterns of chemical bonding in extended solids. Many more useful (oen quite complex) theoretical descriptors of chemical bonding appeared, and it is not possible to mention them all in this short commentary.\nChem.

A chemist\u2019s typical way of thinking is that if a separation between two atoms in the solid state exceeds the sum of the van der Waals (vdW) radii of these atoms, then there is no appreciable interaction between them. If the said separation is shorter than the respective sum, then there is some interaction. If the separation is very short, and approaches the sum of atomic or ionic radii of these elements, then there is a genuine chemical bond between them. The closer atoms get together (non-aggravated by external pressure), the stronger the chemical bond.\nNow, Alvarez and Echeverr\u0301\u0131a12 suggest looking at chemical bonding in isolated molecules or in extended solids using a new quantitative descriptor. This new index is, in some ways, related to the size of the electronic cloud surrounding the atom, and certainly reects the way of thinking along the lines described in the\nFig. 1 Ranges of penetration indices presented b showing the continuous distribution from the ve interactions to the strongly covalent metal\u2013met with permission from the Royal Society of Chem\n11598 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 11597\u201311600\npreceding paragraph. They dene the penetration index between atoms A and B as:\niAB = vA + vB \u2212 dAB (1)\nwhere vx is the vdW radius of element x (x = A, B), while dAB is the distance between the nuclei of the A and B elements. Then, they convert this into a dimensionless descriptor:\npAB = 100$(vA + vB \u2212 dAB)/[(vA \u2212 rA) + (vB \u2212 rB)] [%] (2)\nwhere the corresponding ri corresponds to the covalent radius of element i.\nIn this way, pAB measures the degree to which iAB penetrates the combined width of the vdW regions of two atoms, A and B. The benet from such denition is that pAB = 0% corresponds to the situation when the two vdW spheres are just touching each other (i.e., dAB = vA + vB), while pAB = 100% means they are interpenetrating up to the point where the two valence spheres touch each other (i.e.,\ny the different bond types discussed in ref. 12, ry low penetration of the pure van der Waals al quintuple bonds. Reproduced from ref. 12, istry.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s\ndAB = rA + rB). The rst instance corresponds formally to no bonding at all, the latter to a \u201cclassical covalent bonding\u201d.\nThese authors have analyzed an impressive number of systems using their new descriptor and they conrmed its usefulness for describing all sorts of interatomic interactions, from very weak to very strong. An emerging picture, that there is a continuity of bonding across the entire vdW crust all the way to the valence region, nicely conrms what has already been seen in numerous experiments (particularly those at elevated external pressure13). The summarizing Fig. 46 in the original article (reproduced herein as Fig. 1) shows that the new index, pAB, beautifully describes chemical bonding across diverse systems and bonding situations.\nThis unied picture holds from the region of very low penetration (pure van der Waals interactions) to the strongly covalent and very short metal\u2013metal quintuple bonds, where the penetration index approaches 150%. It describes very nicely the complex nature of weak 1- and 3-electron bonds, halogen bonds and hydrogen bonds, as well as donor\u2013 acceptor (acid/base) interactions.\nThe pAB is certainly a didactically useful index, just like, e.g., bond order; the explanatory strength of both integers and percent values is that they are simple to convey and thus are useful pedagogical tools for those teaching introductory chemistry. However, it should be stressed that \u2013 despite what Fig. 1 seems to suggest \u2013 its applicability seems to be rather qualitative, and one should use pAB with great caution when comparing two vaguely related bonds and sometimes even the related ones.\nThe problem of very different relative thicknesses of the vdW crusts\nOne key problem with the denition according to eqn (2) is that the size of the vdW crust relative to the valence region (Vi/Ri) is not identical for all elements. Indeed, this may greatly vary; for example, Vi/Ri is ca. 4.47 for He, and as little as 1.17 for Fr.14 In other words, the vdW crust is very thick relative to the valence region for the former, and very thin for the latter. At rst, this does not\n).

Inner cores represent the valence region and more diffuse ones the vdW region. Black lines show the bond length in a diatomic molecule.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

However, upon closer inspection we do detect a problem, which is illustrated in Fig. 2 and described below.\nFor H2, the pAB takes the value of 99.9%. It takes a very similar value of 100% for Li2. In these cases, the valence spheres touch each other, and one may expect the presence of a covalent bond (a single sigma bond in both cases). On the other hand, for a LiH molecule (with its partly ionic character), the pAB equals 107.1%. This is not extremely far from those for H2 and Li2. In any case, this index tells us qualitatively that there is slight penetration of the valence regions aside from the vdW ones. In the extreme case of a FrH molecule, the pAB equals 135%, and thus it is the largest among the four. Given what Fig. 1 seems to suggest, one would expect the strongest chemical bonding in this series to be seen for FrH, while the factual trend is just the opposite (the dissociation energies are vastly different: 4.5 eV for H2, 2.5 eV for LiH, and 1.7 eV for FrH).\nOne might expect (even given the complexity of the electronic structure of Fr and the increasing (p,d,f)-orbital\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal So\ncharacter of its valence orbitals) that the H2, LiH, and FrH series (made from monovalent s-block elements) should exhibit some easily explicable trend. Unfortunately, pAB fails to deliver a qualitatively convincing explanation in this case.\nOne may clearly see in Fig. 2 that part of the problem is that in the FrH molecule, the difference in sizes of two atoms and the very different Vi/Ri values lead to enormous penetration of the vdW region of H, but not of Fr. A single index has a problem with grasping this complexity and the resulting consequences.\nOne will run into similar difficulties while trying to describe the very complex chemical bonding present in diactinide molecules; while the pAB values for U2 and U2H2 are immense, some 200%,12 it is not exactly clear what these values mean and how they may be correlated with other important molecular parameters.\nSummarizing, the chemical bond is a very complex object. It stems from a balance of weak and strong forces, some of which are attractive but many of which are repulsive; some electronic density is located directly between nuclei to decrease their repulsion (sigma bonds); however, some may be located in\nciety of Chemistry\nthe regions departing from the straight line that connects the nuclei (pi, delta and phi bonds), or even far away from the atomic cores (as happens in electrides, for example). Charge transfer may occur. Excited states have a totally different distribution of electronic density than the ground states and usually longer bonds than the ground states, but fascinating exceptions are observed (take C2 or Be2, for example). Transition states of chemical reactions are characterized by complex multicenter bonding, where none of the key bonds of the reaction center are similar to what we are used to by studying the typical ground states. Last but not least, unusual bonding may be present for systems where substantial charge transfer takes place at appreciable distance, well above the sum of two vdW radii.16\nThe strength of the new approach by Alvarez and Echeverr\u0301\u0131a12 is in its simplicity; any chemical bond may be analyzed in this way and reduced to a single number, which is obviously very useful and allows for drawing many meaningful (and even semi-quantitative) comparisons. Unfortunately, the weakness of this approach stems from the same source. As history teaches us, the\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 11597\u201311600 | 11599\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
