    "abstractText": "Purpose Some patients with histologically confirmed primary mCRC and mutated RAS reported undetectable RAS mutant clones in plasma after receiving anti-VEGF treatment. The aim was to prospectively assess it with its potential therapeutic implications. Methods RAS mutant genes in solid biopsy (before first-line treatment: FOLFOX/CAPOX + bevacizumab) were compared in liquid biopsy (before second-line treatment: panitumumab + FOLFIRI), using IdyllaTM system. Discordant results between solid/liquid biopsies were assessed by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) test (solid/liquid biopsies). Results Twenty-three patients were assessed (seven had RAS mutant discrepancies between solid/liquid biopsies). The NGS test confirmed that 3/23 (13%) patients had undetectable RAS mutant clones in liquid biopsy and 3/23 (13%) presented discrepancies in solid biopsy (IdyllaTM system vs. NGS test). Conclusion Thirteen percentage of patients had undetectable RAS mutant clones in liquid biopsy after first-line treatment. However, some discrepancies between solid and liquid biopsies have been observed. These results suggest a need to improve accuracy of RAS analyses, especially in solid biopsies.",

The determination must be performed in tumor tissue upon the diagnosis of metastatic disease either at the primary tumor or the metastatic disease [1].\nCirculating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) that originates from the currently present tumor has the same genetic and epigenetic alterations, which are related to tumor development, progression, and treatment resistance [2\u20134].

TP53 and KRAS mutations, microsatellite instability or loss of heterozygosity, together with DNA hyper-methylation can be detected using ctDNA [5]. The analysis of ctDNA also so-called as a \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d has been proposed as an alternative to the invasive techniques for obtaining tumor samples. This liquid biopsy enables minimally invasive monitoring of tumor evolution over, and could provide current genetic information before initiate second-line treatment [2\u20134].\nSome patients with primary mCRC and RAS mutation have reported undetectable RAS mutant clones in plasma after receiving anti-VEGF treatment. These patients were eligible for treatment with EGFR inhibitors and treated, achieving a clinical benefit. However, these results were reported in a small sample size, and the evidence of the clinical benefit with EGFR inhibitors was limited to one treatment [2].\nThe aim of this study was to prospectively assess the RAS genotype in patients with primary mCRC and mutated RAS in solid biopsy using Idylla\u2122 system (before first-line treatment) and disease progression after first-line treatment with FOLFOX/CAPOX + bevacizumab. RAS genes in liquid biopsy (before second-line treatment: panitumumab + FOLFIRI) assessed with Idylla\u2122 system were performed.

Baseline characteristics are described in Table\u00a01.\nAmong these screened patients, none met the selection criteria (19 patients do not meet the undetectable RAS mutant clones in liquid biopsy prior to second-line initiation, one did not have disease progression, one was on third-line treatment, one had interstitial pneumonitis, and one received not permitted medication).\nAlthough the study could not be performed, the results of RAS mutation analysis before first-line and second-line treatment, respectively, have reported new knowledge and learning about it (Fig.\u00a01). RAS mutations were maintained before second-line treatment in 16 out of 23 (69.6%) patients (Idylla\u2122 system) (Table\u00a02). By contrast, some discrepancies between solid biopsy and liquid biopsy using Idylla\u2122 system (seven out of 23 patients) were observed and were confirmed by the NGS test (Table\u00a03). In four patients (1-003,\n1 3\n1-005, 1-007 and 4-001), RAS mutation in solid biopsy was not detected in liquid biopsy using Idylla\u2122 system. Results in liquid biopsy using NGS test allowed to detect KRAS mutation in patient 1-003. Therefore, in three out of\n23 patients (13.0%) (1-005, 1-007 and 4-001), undetectable\u00a0ctDNA in liquid biopsy was verified by NGS test. In addition, in three patients (4-001, 3-002 and 2-002), some discrepancies in the RAS mutation genes (KRAS and NRAS\nN = 23\n1 3\ngenes) (Idylla\u2122 system) were reported between solid and liquid biopsies. In these three patients, the results of NGS test confirmed some discrepancies vs. Idylla\u2122 system, in solid biopsies: patient 4-001 reported NRAS mutation in solid biopsy using Idylla\u2122 system when only BRAF mutation was confirmed by NGS test, patient 3-002 reported KRAS mutation in solid biopsy while it was confirmed by NGS test that this was a NRAS mutation. The patient 2-002 reported NRAS mutation in solid biopsy but it was confirmed by NGS test that this was a KRAS mutation. These analyses were repeated with Idylla\u2122 system in the original tissue and\ncorroborated that the initial results of solid biopsies with Idylla\u2122 system had some mistakes."

            "text": "The genetic analysis of RAS genes of the screening patients that presented discordant results between solid and liquid biopsies (before first and second-line treatment, respectively) using Idylla\u2122 system has allowed us to find some concerns that provide new evidence relevant in clinical practice.\n1 3\nThe results of this study showed that most patients (16 patients, 70%) had concordance between solid (Gold Standard) and liquid biopsy results in RAS mutant clones using Idylla\u2122 system. However, seven patients presented discordant results which were the reason to consider that the Gold Standard fails in the centers. Four of them had absence of any RAS mutations in plasma before initiation of second-line treatment. In three out of four, NGS test in plasma was also non-detectable. However, in the remaining patient (1-003), KRAS mutant could be detected in plasma with NGS test. This fact reinforces the higher sensitivity of NGS test vs. Idylla\u2122 system. The patient\u2019s sample that reported undetectable ctDNA in liquid biopsy with Idylla\u2122 system presented 0.3% MAF.\nAmong the three patients with undetectable ctDNA, patient 1-007 was a patient who was still alive with low burden disease (2\u00a0cm lymphadenopathy: renal artery and terminal ileum) and patient 4-001 had metastasis in bone and paracolic gutter. By contrast, the patient 1-005 presented metastasis in lung and liver. The biological characteristic of the tumor is still poorly understood. Kagawa et\u00a0al. [7] reported some discordances between plasma and tissuesbased analyses related to the location of primary tumor, diameter, and number of metastatic lesions. Some studies reported a low proportion of undetectable RAS mutant clones (1.6\u20138.5%) in mCRC patients [8], while others found 45% (five out of 11) patients with RAS mutation not detected in plasma [2].\nIn the remaining three patients, some RAS mutations differences in solid biopsy using Idylla\u2122 system and NGS test were observed. The genetic analyses were repeated a second time by the Idylla\u2122 system in solid biopsy and support those obtained with the NGS test, which confirms that the previous results in Idylla\u2122 system were most likely due to technical issues during routine testing. With the development of KRAS inhibitors, it is crucial to have an accurate result to know which codon and exon are mutated for a better therapeutic approach.\nColorectal cancer harbors a considerable heterogeneity, and the treatments imposed evolutionary pressure in selection of RAS mutations at progression of disease [9\u201311]. Genotyping cancer is mandatory in clinical practice to personalize the treatments. For example, recent evidence supports the use of the mismatch repair gene (MMR) testing for the implication of adjuvant therapy in patients with stage II colorectal cancer. The favorable prognosis of patients with stage II MSI-H colorectal cancer and the lack of benefit from adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based therapy, indicate that these patients should avoid adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, testing for MMR status by MSI analysis or immunohistochemistry should be recommended in stage II colorectal cancer in patients who are candidates to adjuvant treatment is a consideration [12]. Therefore, improvement of good clinical\npractice to detect RAS mutation (especially using Idylla\u2122 in solid biopsy), quality standard of care, monitorization, and the availability and the use of CEN technical documents and ISO standards for analytical procedures are needed.\nThis study has some limitations. This study was initially not designed to assess the genetic analysis of RAS genes in mCRC patients and the sample size was very small. The lack accessibility to liquid biopsies before first-line treatment is also an important limitation. To achieve an appropriate design, assessing RAS status in both solid and liquid biopsies should have been performed before first-line and before second-line treatment using both Idylla\u2122 and NGS tests. In addition, the absence of detectable RAS mutations in plasma found before second-line treatment cannot certainly exclude that a RAS mutation might be present in the sample below the assay limit of detection. The sensitivity of the genetic analyses is relevant, and it is known that below 1% MAF, Idylla [13] has a reduced KRAS mutation detection in plasma."

Moreover, a lower percentage of undetectable RAS mutant clones compared with previous studies was observed. Therefore, there is a need for clinical improvement in the accuracy of the genotype analysis, especially in solid biopsies. As there is clonal selection, this type of approach should be implemented as part of the care of these patients, which will allow an adequate follow-up. In addition, this approach will not only be implemented in mCRC but also in localized disease.\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to thank Jo\u00e3o Ramalho and Alfonso Troyano from Biocartis NV.
