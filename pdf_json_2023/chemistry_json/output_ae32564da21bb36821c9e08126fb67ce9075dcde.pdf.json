This study established a rapid and effective ultra-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method to detect arbidol and its metabolite arbidol sulfoxide (M6-1) levels in vivo and in vitro. In this study, a 200 \u03bcL incubation system was used to study the inhibitory effect of the antitumor drug napabucasin on arbidol in vitro, with IC50 values of 2.25, 3.91, and 67.79 \u03bcM in rat liver microsomes (RLMs), human liver microsomes (HLMs), and CYP3A4.1, respectively. In addition, we found that the mechanism of inhibition was noncompetitive inhibition in RLM and mixed inhibition in HLM. In pharmacokinetic experiments, it was observed that after gavage administration of 48 mg/kg napabucasin and 20 mg/kg arbidol, napabucasin inhibited the metabolism of arbidol in vivo and significantly changed the pharmacokinetic parameters of arbidol, such as AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-\u221e), in rats. We also found that napabucasin increased the AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-\u221e) of M6-1, the main metabolite of arbidol. This study provides a reference for the combined use of napabucasin and arbidol in clinical practice.\nKEYWORDS\narbidol, napabucasin, drug\u2013drug interactions, metabolism, CYP3A4\n1 Introduction\nIn 1993, arbidol was introduced as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug to prevent and treat influenza infection (Boriskin et al., 2008). Arbidol 200 mg taken three times a day for about a week can reduce the duration of influenza by 1.7\u20132.65 days in clinical trials (Leneva et al., 2009). In recent years, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a significant threat to respiratory diseases and lung infections (Kirtipal et al., 2020; Vellingiri et al., 2020). Arbidol has been widely used for the prevention of COVID19 and to improve the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (Nguyen et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). Other applications of arbidol can be found as well. For example, studies showed that arbidol was also an effective and safe way to treat verruca plantaris and that topical administration of arbidol was more acceptable to patients (Chen et al., 2020)."

For example, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and arbidol will be a risk factor for liver injury in patients with non-critical COVID-19 (Cai et al., 2020). Studies reported that when LPV/r was combined with arbidol, the Cmax of arbidol was increased and the AUC(0-\u221e) of arbidol was significantly increased from 705.6 to 1250.3 ng/mL*h (Huang et al., 2021). In addition, pharmacokinetic and metabolic differences caused by administration of arbidol were found in male and female rats. When arbidol was used in combination with the famous Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen to treat COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2021), the levels of eosinophils and lymphocytes in patients were increased, which indicated that the combination was helpful in treating the progression of COVID-19.\nIn cancer treatment, napabucasin is a therapy that targets signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways (Hubbard and Grothey, 2017; Chang et al., 2019). Several types of cancer can be treated with napabucasin alone or in combination, including advanced colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma (Hubbard and Grothey, 2017). Furthermore, napabucasin administration in rats inhibits both apoptosis and oxidative stress, protecting neonatal rat neuronal cells from damage (Wang et al., 2019). There is a possibility that napabucasin could be used in the future to treat brain damage.\nDrugs are often used in combination during the treatment of cancer, as cancer patients were also found to be affected with COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020; Brito-Dellan et al., 2022). However, drug\u2013drug interactions (DDI) between napabucasin and the antiviral drug arbidol have not been reported previously. Therefore, rapid detection of plasma levels of arbidol and its\nmetabolite was established by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and further studies of its interaction with napabucasin were conducted in vitro and in vivo."

Then, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes, centrifuged at 75,600 x g for 2 h, the supernatants were discarded, and three or four times the volume of cold 0.01 mM phosphate-buffered saline was added to the precipitate for homogenization. Finally, the protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce\u2122 BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) (He et al., 2018).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03\n2.4 In vitro DDI studies in RLM, HLM, and CYP3A4.1\nThe 200 \u03bcL incubation system was as follows: 0.3 mg/mL RLM (0.3 mg/mL HLM), 1 mM NADPH, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and arbidol. Arbidol was used in a range of concentrations (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcM) to determine Km (Michaelis constant) in RLM. In HLM, a series of concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 \u03bcM) of arbidol were used to determine Km. In CYP3A4.1, the following concentrations of arbidol were used to determine Km: 1, 10, 20, 50, 150, 200, 250 \u03bcM. Napabucasin was established at concentrations 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 \u03bcM to determine its IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) versus arbidol (4.66, 2.63, and 28.39 \u03bcM in RLM, HLM, and CYP3A4.1, respectively, according to their Km values). In addition, the changes in Michaelis\u2013Menten curves in the presence of napabucasin were investigated in RLM and HLM. To study the type of inhibition mechanism, we used the Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot analysis and inhibition constant (Ki and \u03b1Ki) calculation, where drug concentrations were set as follows: 1.17, 2.33, 4.66, and 9.32 \u03bcM for arbidol and 0, 1.13, 2.25, and 4.50 \u03bcM for napabucasin in RLM. In HLM, the concentrations of arbidol were 0.66, 1.32, 2.63, and 5.26 \u03bcM, and those of napabucasin were 0, 0.98, 1.95, and 3.90 \u03bcM. The components in the incubation system were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 min. After adding NADPH, the reaction was initiated and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. After the stop reaction\nat \u221280\u00b0C, 400 \u03bcL of acetonitrile and 20 \u03bcL of IS (lopinavir 200 ng/mL) were added for post-treatment, vortexed for 2 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, the supernatant was used for quantitative analysis using UPLCMS/MS.\n2.5 In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments\nSprague\u2013Dawley rats (200 \u00b1 20 g, approximately 6 weeks) were supplied by The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and used for the pharmacokinetic experiments. Except for fasting 12 h before the start of pharmacokinetic experiments, rats were fed on a standard rodent diet and kept in a 12-h light\u2013dark cycle environment at 20\u00b0C\u201326\u00b0C and 55 \u00b1 15% relative humidity.\nRats were randomly divided into two groups of five each. Arbidol and napabucasin were soluble in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium solution (CMC-Na). The treatment group was given 48 m/kg napabucasin by gavage, and the control group was given 0.5% CMC-Na solution of the same volume. Thirty minutes after the treatment, each rat was given a single administration of 20 mg/kg of arbidol. Blood samples were obtained from the caudal veins at different times (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h). A volume of 10 \u03bcL of IS (200 ng/mL) and 300 \u03bcL of acetonitrile was added to 100 \u03bcL of plasma and mixed in the Eppendorf tube. The UPLC-MS/MS analysis of the supernatant was conducted after centrifuging the mixture at 13,000 rpm for 10 min.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04"

In addition, the Michaelis\u2013Menten parameters for napabucasin inhibition of arbidol had remarkable changes (Supplementary Figures S1, S2), where Vmax and CLint were decreased to 43.1% and 18.2% in RLM and 59.0% and 50.0% in HLM, respectively.

            "text": "Arbidol is a popular drug for the treatment of COVID-19, and its pharmacokinetic metabolism in the body is gradually attracting attention (Deng et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022). In the context of the gradual implementation of individualized drug application, we established a rapid and effective detection method to detect the levels of arbidol and its metabolite using UPLC-MS/MS.\nThe chromatogram analysis results of UPLC-MS/MS showed that there was no interference between arbidol, M6-1, and IS during the detection process. When 1 < IC50 < 10 \u03bcM, it was considered medium inhibitory efficiency (Jin et al., 2015). The metabolic study of arbidol in the incubation system we established found that the IC50 of napabucasin for arbidol was IC50 = 2.25 \u03bcM < 10 \u03bcM in RLM and IC50 = 3.91 \u03bcM < 10 \u03bcM in HLM. This indicated that napabucasin exhibited medium inhibition on the metabolism of arbidol in RLM and HLM. Additionally, napabucasin inhibited the\nmetabolism of arbidol to 3.73% in RLM. Among the many antitumor drugs, we also found that the metabolic inhibition rate of olmutinib, adagrasib, and sunitinib on arbidol was also below 10% (this part of the data has not yet been published). To prevent adverse reactions, it is recommended to pay attention to DDI when using chemotherapy drugs with arbidol to treat diseases in the clinic. Arbidol inhibition studies with napabucasin showed that there were differences between species in vitro. The type of inhibition mechanism was non-competitive inhibition in RLM, while the inhibition type was mixed inhibition in HLM. In addition, in HLM, Ki and \u03b1Ki (\u03b1 = 0.54) were 1.59 and 0.86 \u03bcM, respectively. However, the mechanism in CYP3A4.1 was not investigated due to its excessive IC50.\nCombination medications are used to treat critical patients with COVID-19 and cancer (Deng et al., 2020; Amani et al., 2021). Arbidol is mainly metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme in humans, so theoretically inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 will affect the metabolism of arbidol. LPV/r as protease inhibitors had a significant interaction with arbidol, which increased the Cmax and AUC(0-\u221e) of both drugs (Huang et al., 2021). In this experiment, napabucasin is found to be a bioactivator of quinone oxidoreductase 1 that generates reactive oxygen species (Chang et al., 2019; Froeling et al., 2019). Clinically, it is mainly used for the combination of gastric cancer and metastatic colon cancer in treating diseases (Li et al., 2015). Previous studies showed that in vitro, napabucasin is an inhibitor of the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A isozymes; in vivo DDI experimental clinical studies investigating the effect of napabucasin on the seven main cytochrome enzymes in the human body found that it may only cause moderate inhibition of CYP2B6 and has no induction or inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A, or the BCRP/OAT3 (Dai et al., 2021). According to our results, the in vivo pharmacokinetic results of our study in rats are not consistent with this result, which showed that the combination of napabucasin and arbidol increased the concentration of arbidol in rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters were statistically significant, including AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-\u221e) (Table 2). Under the influence of napabucasin, the CLz/F of both arbidol and its main metabolite M6-1 had been slowed compared to the drug alone. The slowdown of M6-1 metabolism may further affect the metabolism of arbidol in vivo, so future studies should pay attention to the plasma concentration of the metabolite.\nThe aforementioned results showed that napabucasin inhibited arbidol metabolism in vivo and in vitro. The differences in inhibitory\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07\neffects in RLM and HLM may come from differences between species, as the amount of CYP3A4 expressed was not the same between species. Previous studies reported that differences in sexes can be observed in arbidol metabolism, but unfortunately, this experiment did not compare the metabolic differences of napabucasin and arbidol between rat sexes. A future study in clinics should investigate the effect of napabucasin on arbidol metabolism in humans and whether gender affects the interaction between the two drugs."

Moreover, in rat pharmacokinetic studies, napabucasin inhibited the metabolism of arbidol and its main metabolite M6-1 in a subtle way.
