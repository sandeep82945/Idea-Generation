            "text": "Dedicated to Professor V.A. Marchenko on the occasion of his birthday\n1. Introduction\nThe problem addressed in this paper belongs to spectral analysis of periodic differential operators. It is well-known (see, e.g., [7, 23, 24]) that the spectrum of such operators has the form of a locally finite union of compact intervals (bands). In general the bands may touch each other and even (in the multidimensional case) overlap. The open interval (\u03b1, \u03b2) is called a gap if it has an empty intersection with the spectrum, but its endpoints belong to it.\nThe presence of gaps in the spectrum is not guaranteed. For example, the spectrum of the Laplacian on Rn has no gaps: \u03c3(\u2212\u2206Rn) = [0, \u221e). Therefore the natural and interesting problem arises here: to construct examples of periodic operators with non-void spectral gaps. This problem has been actively studied since mid of the 90th and currently a lot of examples for various classes of periodic operators are available in the literature. We refer to some pioneer articles [9\u201312, 30], further references can be found in the overviews [13, 24].\nThe problem of the spectral gaps opening received a strong motivation coming from the advances in investigation of novel materials of various sorts, in particular, the so-called photonic crystals \u2013 periodic dielectric nanostructure whose characteristic feature is that they strongly affect the propagation of light waves at certain optical frequencies, which is caused by gaps in the spectrum of the Maxwell operator or related scalar operators. In practice, one deals with artificially fabricated photonic crystals, which are composed of relatively simple materials (dielectrics or metals) in a tricky way and have a spatially periodic structure, typically at the length scale of hundred nanometers. For more details on mathematics of photonic crystals we refer to [6].\n1 Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Hradec Kra\u0301love\u0301, Czech Republic 2 Department of Theoretical Physics, Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, R\u030cez\u030c, Czech Republic 3 B.

In the present paper, we investigate this problem for the Neumann Laplacian A\u03b5 on unbounded periodic domain \u2126\u03b5 \u2282 Rn (n \u2265 2), which is obtained by removing from Rn m families of \u03b5-periodically distributed small resonators (see Figure 1.1, left picture):\n\u2126\u03b5 = Rn \\ \u22c3\ni\u2208Zn m\u22c3 j=1 \u03b5(Rj,\u03b5 + i), m \u2208N. (1.1)\nHere \u03b5 > 0 is a small parameter, the sets Rj,\u03b5 (resonators), j \u2208 {1, . . . , m} have the form Rj,\u03b5 = (Fj \\ Bj) \\ Tj,\u03b5\nwhere Bj \u2282 Fj \u2282 (0, 1)n and Tj,\u03b5 are thin passages connecting the opposite sides of the domain Fj \\ Bj (see Figure 1.1, right picture). The passages diameters \u03b7j,\u03b5 are chosen as follows,\nWe demonstrate that the spectrum \u03c3(A\u03b5) of A\u03b5 has the following properties: \u2022 there is \u039b > 0 such that \u03c3(A\u03b5) has m gaps withing the interval [0, \u039b\u03b5\u22122] for suffi-\nciently small \u03b5, \u2022 the endpoints of these m gaps converges to the endpoints of some pairwise disjoint\nintervals (\u03b1j, \u03b2 j). The numbers \u03b1j and \u03b2 j depend on the lengths of the passages, the (re-scaled) areas of their cross-sections and the volumes of the domains Fj and Bj, \u2022 one can choose the domains Fj, Bj and the constants standing at the expressions for\n\u03b7j,\u03b5 (see (2.6)) in such a way that (\u03b1j, \u03b2 j) do coincide with predefined intervals.\nSimilar problem was treated by the first author in [20] for \u201czero-thickness\u201d resonators, i.e. when \u2126\u03b5 is again of the form (1.1), but the sets Rj,\u03b5 have the form Rj,\u03b5 = \u2202Bj \\ Tj,\u03b5, where Bj are bounded domains and Tj,\u03b5 are small subsets of \u2202Bj. In this case the critical scaling for the diameters \u03b7j,\u03b5 of Tj,\u03b5 is\n\u03b7j,\u03b5 = O(\u03b5 2 n\u22122 ) as n > 2 and | ln(\u03b5\u03b7j,\u03b5)|\u22121 = O(\u03b52) as n = 2.\nThe problem of opening of spectral gaps having prescribed locations and lengths was also considered in [17] for Laplace-Beltrami operators on periodic Riemannian manifolds, in [19] for periodic elliptic operators on Rn, in [2, 21] for periodic quantum graphs, and in [8] for periodic Schro\u0308dinger operators with singular potentials. The proofs in [17, 19] rely on methods of homogenization theory, while in [2,8,20,21] the approach is close to the one of the present paper (asymptotic analysis of the quasi-periodic, Neumann and Dirichlet eigenvalue problems on a smallest period cell).\nPeculiar effects caused by inserting small resonators are long known. For example, a suitably scaled resonator may abruptly change the spectrum (even if the resonator diameter is very small) \u2013 the first example goes back to the Courant-Hilbert monograph [4], further investigations were carried out in [1, 28]. Another remarkable application of small resonators is the possibility to construct materials with frequency-dependent effective properties, with large and/or negative permittivities [25], materials with memory [26], etc. (see the overview [29] for more details).\nIn the next section we formulate the problem more precisely and present the main results. We also demonstrate how to apply these results for photonic crystals design.\n2. Problem setting and main results\nLet \u03b5 > 0 (the small parameter), n \u2208 N \\ {1} (the space dimension), m \u2208 N (the number of resonators per a period cell). We set\nM := {1, . . . , m}, M0 := {0, . . . , m}. (2.1)\nIn the following, by x\u2032 = (x1, . . . , xn\u22121) and x = (x\u2032, xn) we denote the Cartesian coordinates in Rn\u22121 and Rn, respectively.\nLet (Fj)j\u2208M, (Bj)j\u2208M be Lipschitz domains in Rn satisfying\nBj \u2282 Fj, Fj \u2282 Y := (0, 1)n, j \u2208M, Fi \u2229 Fj = \u2205, i 6= j.\nFurthermore, we assume that for each j \u2208 M there exist zj = (z\u2032j, znj ) \u2208 Rn and positive numbers hj and dj such that{\nx = (x\u2032, xn) \u2208 Rn : |xn \u2212 znj | < hj/2, \u2016x\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032j\u2016Rn\u22121 \u2264 dj } \u2282 Fj \\ Bj, (2.2){\nx = (x\u2032, xn) \u2208 Rn : xn \u2212 znj = hj/2, \u2016x\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032j\u2016Rn\u22121 \u2264 dj } \u2282 \u2202Fj, (2.3){\nx = (x\u2032, xn) \u2208 Rn : xn \u2212 znj = \u2212hj/2, \u2016x\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032j\u2016Rn\u22121 \u2264 dj } \u2282 \u2202Bj (2.4)\n(here \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Rn\u22121 stands for the Euclidean distance in Rn\u22121). We define the passage Tj,\u03b5 connecting the opposite sides of Fj \\ Bj via\nTj,\u03b5 := { x = (x\u2032, xn) : |xn \u2212 znj | \u2264 hj/2, x\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032j \u2208 \u03b7j,\u03b5Dj } , (2.5)\nwhere\n\u03b7j,\u03b5 = \u03b7j\u03b5 2/(n\u22121), \u03b7j > 0, (2.6)\n(Dj)j\u2208M are connected Lipschitz domains in Rn\u22121 satisfying 0 \u2208 Dj and \u03b5 is sufficiently small in order to have \u03b7j,\u03b5Dj \u2282 {x\u2032 \u2208 Rn\u22121 : \u2016x\u2032\u2016Rn\u22121 < dj}. Finally, we define the domain\n\u2126\u03b5 (see Figure 1.1, left picture):\n\u2126\u03b5 = Rn \\ \u22c3\ni\u2208Zn \u22c3 j\u2208M \u03b5(Rj,\u03b5 + i).\nwhere the sets Rj,\u03b5, j \u2208 M, which will play role of the resonators before scaling (see Figure 1.1, right picture), are defined via\nRj,\u03b5 = (Fj \\ Bj) \\ Tj,\u03b5.\nThe set \u2126\u03b5 is Zn-periodic with a period cell \u03b5Y\u03b5, where\nY\u03b5 := Y \\ \u22c3\nj\u2208M Rj,\u03b5.\nNow, we define the (minus) Neumann Laplacian A\u03b5 on \u2126\u03b5. In the space L2(\u2126\u03b5) we introduce the sesquilinear form a\u03b5 via\na\u03b5[u, v] = \u222b\n\u2126\u03b5 \u2207u \u00b7 \u2207v dx, dom(a\u03b5) = H1(\u2126\u03b5)\nThis form is densely defined, closed, and positive, hence by the first representation theorem [16, Chapter 6, Theorem 2.1] there is a the unique self-adjoint and positive operator A\u03b5 satisfying dom(A\u03b5) \u2282 dom(a\u03b5) and\n(A\u03b5u, v)L2(\u2126\u03b5) = a\u03b5[u, v], \u2200u \u2208 dom(A\u03b5), \u2200v \u2208 dom(a\u03b5).\nOur goal is to describe the behaviour of the spectrum \u03c3(A\u03b5) of A\u03b5 as \u03b5 \u2192 0. To state the results we have to introduce some notations.\nFor j \u2208M we denote\n\u03b1j := \u03b7n\u22121j |Dj|\nhj|Bj| , (2.7)\nwhere the notation | \u00b7 | stands for the volume of either a domain in Rn (as Bj) or a domain in Rn\u22121 (as Dj). We assume that the numbers \u03b1j are pairwise distinct; without loss of generality we may assume that\n\u03b1j < \u03b1j+1, j \u2208 {1, . . . , m\u2212 1}. (2.8)\nFurthermore, we consider the following function:\nF(\u03bb) := 1 + \u2211 j\u2208M \u03b1j|Bj| |B0|(\u03b1j \u2212 \u03bb) , (2.9)\nwhere the set B0 is defined by B0 := Y \\ \u222aj\u2208MFj.\nIt is easy to see that F(\u03bb) has exactly m zeros, they are real and interlace with \u03b1j provided (2.8) holds. We denote them \u03b2 j, j \u2208M assuming that they are renumbered in the ascending order; then one has\n\u03b1j < \u03b2 j < \u03b1j+1, j \u2208 {1, . . . , m\u2212 1}, \u03b1m < \u03b2m < \u221e. (2.10)\nWe are now in position to formulate the main results of this work.\nTheorem 2.1. There exists \u039b > 0 depending on the set B0 only such that the the spectrum of A\u03b5 has the following form within the interval [0, \u039b\u03b5\u22122] for sufficiently small \u03b5:\n\u03c3(A\u03b5) \u2229 [0, \u039b\u03b5\u22122] = [0, \u039b\u03b5\u22122] \\ \u22c3 j\u2208M (\u03b1j,\u03b5, \u03b2 j,\u03b5)  (2.11) The closures of the intervals (\u03b1j,\u03b5, \u03b2 j,\u03b5) \u2282 (0, \u039b\u03b5\u22122) are pairwise disjoint and their endpoints satisfy\nlim \u03b5\u21920 \u03b1j,\u03b5 = \u03b1j, lim \u03b5\u21920 \u03b2 j,\u03b5 = \u03b2 j. (2.12)\nOur second result states that one can choose the resonators in such a way that the limiting intervals (\u03b1j, \u03b2 j) coincide with prescribed intervals.\nTheorem 2.2. Let (\u03b1\u0303j)j\u2208M and (\u03b2\u0303 j)j\u2208M be positive numbers satisfying\n\u03b1\u0303j < \u03b2\u0303 j < \u03b1\u0303j+1, j \u2208 {1, . . . , m\u2212 1}, \u03b1\u0303m < \u03b2\u0303m < \u221e. (2.13) Then one can choose the domains Fj, Bj and the numbers \u03b7j in such a way that\n\u03b1j = \u03b1\u0303j, \u03b2 j = \u03b2\u0303 j, j \u2208M.\nBefore to proceed to the proof of the above results we briefly demonstrate how to apply them for constructing periodic 2D photonic crystals; for more details see [22].\nWe introduce the following sets in R3 (see Figure 2.1): \u2126\u0303\u03b5 = { (x1, x2, z) \u2208 R3 : x = (x1, x2) \u2208 \u2126\u03b5, z \u2208 R } , R\u0303\u03b5 = R3 \\ \u2126\u0303\u03b5,\nwhere \u2126\u03b5 \u2282 R2 is a periodic domain being defined above. We assume that \u2126\u0303\u03b5 is occupied by a dielectric medium with the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability being equal to 1, while the set R\u0303\u03b5 is made of a perfectly conducting material.\nIt is well-known that the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the dielectric \u2126\u0303\u03b5 is governed by the Maxwell operator M\u03b5 acting on U = (E, H) (E and H are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively) as follows,\nM\u03b5U = (i\u2207\u00d7 H, \u2212i\u2207\u00d7 E) ,\nsubject to the conditions\n\u2207 \u00b7 E = \u2207 \u00b7 H = 0 in \u2126\u0303\u03b5, E\u03c4 = 0, H\u03bd = 0 on \u2202R\u0303\u03b5. Here E\u03c4 and H\u03bd are the tangential and normal components of E and H, respectively.\nIn the following we focus on the case when E, H depends on x1, x2 only, i.e. the waves propagated along the plane {z = 0}. It is known that if the medium is periodic in two directions and homogeneous with respect to the third one (2D medium), then the analysis of the Maxwell operator reduces to the analysis of scalar elliptic operators on the twodimensional cross-section \u2126\u03b5. Namely, we denote\nJ = { (E, H) : \u2207 \u00b7 E = \u2207 \u00b7 H = 0 in \u2126\u0303\u03b5, E\u03c4 = H\u00b5 = 0 on \u2202R\u0303\u03b5 } ,\nJE = {(E, H) \u2208 J : E1 = E2 = H3 = 0}, JH = {(E, H) \u2208 J : H1 = H2 = E3 = 0}. The elements of JE and JH are called TE (Transverse Electric)- and TM(Transverse Magnetic)polarized waves, respectively. JE and JH are invariant subspaces of M\u03b5, they are L2-orthogonal, and each U \u2208 J can be represented in unique way as U = UE + UH with UE \u2208 JE, UH \u2208 JH. Consequently, one has\n\u03c3(M\u03b5) = \u03c3(M\u03b5|JE) \u222a \u03c3(M\u03b5|JH ). (2.14)\nWe denote by AD\u03b5 and A\u03b5, respectively, the Dirichlet and the Neumann Laplacians on \u2126\u03b5. One can be show (see, e.g, [14]) that\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03c3(M\u03b5|JE) \u21d4 \u03c92 \u2208 \u03c3(AD\u03b5 ) and \u03c9 \u2208 \u03c3(M\u03b5|JH ) \u21d4 \u03c92 \u2208 \u03c3(A\u03b5). (2.15)\nThe spectrum of A\u03b5 is already described, see Theorems 2.1\u20132.2. As for the spectrum of A D\u03b5 , one can easily derive (cf. [22, Lemma 3.1]) the following Poincare-type inequality:\naD\u03b5 [u, u] \u2265 C\u03b5\u22122\u2016u\u20162L2(\u2126\u03b5), \u2200u \u2208 dom(a D \u03b5 )\n(the constant C > 0 is independent of \u03b5, aD\u03b5 is the form associated with A D\u03b5 ). Consequently, inf \u03c3(AD\u03b5 )\u2192 \u221e, \u03b5\u2192 0. (2.16) Then by virtue of Theorem 2.1, (2.14)\u2013(2.16) we conclude that for an arbitrary (large enough) L > 0 the Maxwell operator M\u03b5 has 2m gaps in [\u2212L, L] when \u03b5 is sufficiently small. These gaps converge to the intervals \u00b1(\u221a\u03b1j, \u221a \u03b2 j), whose location and lengths can be controlled via a suitable choice of the resonators (see Theorem 2.2). The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of the main results. In Section 3 we prove Theorem 2.1: in Subsection 3.1 we sketch some elements of Floquet-Bloch theory establishing a relationship between the spectrum of A\u03b5 and the spectra of certain operators on Y\u03b5; in Subsection 3.2 we detect \u039b > 0 such that \u03c3(A\u03b5) has at most m gaps within [0, \u039b\u03b5\u22122]; in Subsection 3.3 we recall the abstract result from [15] serving to describe the convergence of eigenvalues of operators in varying Hilbert spaces; using this abstract result we complete the proof in Subsections 3.4\u20133.6. In Section 4 we prove Theorem 2.2.\n3. Proof of Theorem 2.1\nIn the following, if A is a self-adjoint operator with purely discrete spectrum bounded from below and accumulating at \u221e, we denote by \u03bbj(A ) its kth eigenvalue, where, as usual, the eigenvalues are arranged in the ascending order and repeated according to their multiplicities.\nBy C, C1, . . . we denote generic constants being independent of \u03b5 and of functions appearing in the estimates and equalities where these constants occur.\n3.1. Preliminaries. The operator A\u03b5 is Zn-periodic with the period cell \u03b5Y\u03b5. It is convenient to work further with a period cell Y\u03b5, whose internal boundary \u2202Y is \u03b5-independent. Thereby, we set\n\u039e\u03b5 := \u03b5\u22121\u2126\u03b5 = Rn \\ \u22c3\ni\u2208Zn \u22c3 j\u2208M (Rj,\u03b5 + i),\nand introduce the operator A\u03b5 in L2(\u039e\u03b5) via\nA\u03b5 = \u2212\u03b5\u22122\u2206\u039e\u03b5 , where \u2206\u039e\u03b5 is the Neumann Laplacian on \u039e\u03b5. The operator A\u03b5 is periodic with respect to the period cell Y\u03b5, and it is easy to see that\n\u03c3(A\u03b5) = \u03c3(A\u03b5). (3.1)\nThe Floquet-Bloch theory (see, e.g., [7,23,24]) establishes a relationship between the spectrum of A\u03b5 and the spectra of certain operators on Y\u03b5. Namely, let\n\u03b8 = (\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8n) \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)n. We introduce the space H1,\u03b8(Y\u03b5), which consists of functions from H1(Y\u03b5) satisfying the following conditions at the opposite faces of \u2202Y:\n\u2200k \u2208 {1, . . . , n} : u(x + ek) = exp(i\u03b8k)u(x) for x = (x1, x2, . . . , 0, . . . , xn) \u2191\nk-th place\n, (3.2)\nwhere ek = (0, 0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0). In the space L2(Y\u03b5) we introduce the sesquilinear form a\u03b8\u03b5 , a\u03b8\u03b5 [u, v] = \u03b5 \u22122 \u222b\nY\u03b5 \u2207u \u00b7 \u2207v dx, dom(a\u03b8\u03b5 ) = H1,\u03b8(Y\u03b5).\nLet A\u03b8\u03b5 be the associated with this form self-adjoint operator. This operator acts as \u2212\u03b5\u22122\u2206. The functions u \u2208 dom(A\u03b8\u03b5 ) belong to H2loc(Y\u03b5) and, besides (3.2), satisfy\n\u2200k \u2208 {1, . . . , n} : \u2202u \u2202xk (x + ek) = exp(i\u03b8k) \u2202u \u2202xk (x) for x = (x1, x2, . . . , 0, . . . , xn) \u2191\nk-th place\n(3.3)\nThe spectrum of A\u03b8\u03b5 is purely discrete. The Floquet-Bloch theory yields \u03c3(A\u03b5) = \u22c3\nk\u2208N Lk,\u03b5, where Lk,\u03b5 := \u222a\u03b8\u2208[0,2\u03c0)n\n{ \u03bbj(A\u03b8\u03b5 ) } , (3.4)\nand moreover, for any fixed k \u2208N the set Lk,\u03b5 is a compact interval (the kth spectral band). Along with the operators A\u03b8\u03b5 we also introduce the operators AN\u03b5 and AD\u03b5 , which differ from A\u03b8\u03b5 only by the boundary conditions at \u2202Y: instead of the \u03b8-conditions we impose the Neumann and the Dirichlet ones, respectively. More precisely, let AN\u03b5 and AD\u03b5 be the operators in L2(Y\u03b5) being associated with the sesquilinear forms aN\u03b5 and aD\u03b5 with the domains\naN\u03b5 [u, v] = a D \u03b5 [u, v] = \u03b5\n\u22122 \u222b\nY\u03b5 \u2207u \u00b7 \u2207v dx,\ndom(aN\u03b5 ) = H 1(Y\u03b5) and dom(aD\u03b5 ) = { u \u2208 H1(Y\u03b5) : u \u2202Y= 0 } The spectra of these operators are purely discrete. One has\n\u2200\u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)n : dom(aN\u03b5 ) \u2283 dom(a\u03b8\u03b5 ) \u2283 dom(aD\u03b5 ),\nwhence, by the min-max principle [5, Section 4.5], we get\n\u2200k \u2208N, \u2200\u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)n : \u03bbk(AN\u03b5 ) \u2264 \u03bbk(A\u03b8\u03b5 ) \u2264 \u03bbk(AD\u03b5 ). (3.5)\n3.2. Determination of \u039b. In this subsection we detect \u039b > 0 such that the spectrum of A\u03b5 (or, equivalently, the spectrum of A\u03b5, cf. (3.1)) has at most m gaps in the interval [0, \u039b\u03b5\u22122].\nLet \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)n. We consider the following operator in L2(Y\u03b5) = L2(B0)\u2295 ( \u2295j\u2208ML2(Bj \u222a Tj,\u03b5) ) ,\nA\u03b8,dec\u03b5 = ( \u2212\u03b5\u22122\u2206\u03b8B0 ) \u2295 ( \u2295mk=1 ( \u2212\u03b5\u22122\u2206Bj\u222aTj,\u03b5 )) ,\nwhere \u2206\u03b8B0 is the Laplace operator on B0 subject to the Neumann conditions on \u222aj\u2208M\u2202Fj and conditions (3.2), (3.3) on \u2202Y, and \u2206Bj\u222aTj,\u03b5 is the Neumann Laplacian on Bj \u222a Tj,\u03b5, j \u2208M. By a\u03b8,dec\u03b5 we denote the form associated with A \u03b8,dec \u03b5 . In fact, A \u03b8,dec \u03b5 differs from A\u03b8\u03b5 by the Neumann decoupling at Tj,\u03b5 \u2229 B0. It is easy to see that\ndom(a\u03b8,dec\u03b5 ) \u2283 dom(a\u03b8\u03b5 ) and a\u03b8,dec\u03b5 [u, u] = a\u03b8\u03b5 [u, u], \u2200u \u2208 dom(a\u03b8\u03b5 ), whence, by the min-max principle, we get\n\u2200k \u2208M : \u03bbk(A\u03b8,dec\u03b5 ) \u2264 \u03bbk(A\u03b8\u03b5 ).\nThe first m eigenvalues of A\u03b8,dec\u03b5 are equal to zero, while the (m + 1)th eigenvalue equals \u03b5\u22122\u039b\u03b8 , where \u039b\u03b8 is the smallest eigenvalue of the operator \u2212\u2206\u03b8(B0); note that \u039b\u03b8 > 0 if \u03b8 6= (0, 0, . . . , 0). Hence we obtain the estimate\n\u2200\u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)n : \u03b5\u22122\u039b\u03b8 \u2264 \u03bbm+1(A\u03b8\u03b5 ) \u2264 sup Lm+1,\u03b5 (recall that Lm+1,\u03b5 is the (m + 1)th band of \u03c3(A\u03b5), see (3.4)), whence\n\u03b5\u22122\u039b \u2264 sup Lm+1,\u03b5, where \u039b := max \u03b8\u2208[0,2\u03c0)n \u039b\u03b8 . (3.6)\nNote that \u039b depends only on the set B0. From (3.6) and (3.4) we immediately conclude the following result.\nLemma 3.1. The spectrum \u03c3(A\u03b5) has at most m gaps within the interval [0, \u039b\u03b5\u22122].\n3.3. Abstract scheme. To describe the behaviour of the eigenvalues of the operators AN\u03b5 , AD\u03b5 and A\u03b8\u03b5 as \u03b5 \u2192 0, we utilize the abstract result from [15] (see also [27] for more detailed proofs) concerning the convergence of eigenvalues of compact self-adjoint operators in varying Hilbert spaces.\nLet H\u03b5 and H be separable Hilbert spaces, and R\u03b5 and R be linear compact self-adjoint non-negative operators in H\u03b5 and H , respectively. We denote by {\u00b5k,\u03b5}k\u2208N and {\u00b5k}k\u2208N the sequences of eigenvalues of the operators R\u03b5 and R, respectively, being renumbered in the descending order and with account of their multiplicity.\nTheorem 3.2 ( [15, Lemma 1]). Let the following conditions (A1)\u2212 (A4) hold: (A1) There exists linear bounded operator J\u03b5 : H \u2192H\u03b5 such that\n\u2200 f \u2208H : \u2016J\u03b5 f \u2016H\u03b5 \u2192 \u2016 f \u2016H as \u03b5\u2192 0. (A2) The operators R\u03b5 are bounded uniformly in \u03b5. (A3) For any f \u2208H one has\n\u2016R\u03b5J\u03b5 f \u2212J\u03b5R f \u2016H\u03b5 \u2192 0 as \u03b5\u2192 0.\n(A4) For any family { f\u03b5 \u2208 H\u03b5}\u03b5 with sup\u03b5 \u2016 f\u03b5\u2016H\u03b5 < \u221e there exists a subsequence ( f\u03b5m)m\u2208N with \u03b5m \u2192 0 as m\u2192 \u221e and w \u2208H such that\n\u2016R\u03b5m f\u03b5m \u2212J\u03b5m w\u2016H\u03b5m \u2192 0 as m\u2192 \u221e. Then for any k \u2208N we have\n\u00b5k,\u03b5 \u2192 \u00b5k as \u03b5\u2192 0.\nRemark 3.3. The above result was established under the assumption dim H = dim H\u03b5 = \u221e. Tracing its proof in [15,27] one can easily see that for dim H < \u221e and R being a self-adjoint operator in H with \u03c3(R) = {\u00b51 \u2265 \u00b52 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 \u00b5dim(H ) > 0}, the result reads as follows:\nconditions (A1)-(A4) imply lim \u03b5\u21920 \u00b5k,\u03b5 = \u00b5k for k \u2208 {1, . . . , dim H }.\n3.4. Asymptotic behavior of Neumann and periodic eigenvalue problems. One has:\n\u03bb1(AN\u03b5 ) = 0. (3.7)\nFor the next eigenvalues one has the following convergence result.\nLemma 3.4. For any k \u2208 {2, . . . , m + 1} one has \u03bbk(AN\u03b5 )\u2192 \u03b2k\u22121, \u03b5\u2192 0. (3.8)\nProof. Let H N be the space Cm+1 equipped with the weighted scalar product,\n(u, v)H N = \u2211 j\u2208M0 ujvj|Bj| (3.9)\n(recall that the notations M and M0 are defined in (2.1)). Hereinafter the elements of H N are denoted by bold letters, and their entries are enumerated starting from zero:\nu \u2208H N \u21d2 u = (u0, . . . , um) with uj \u2208 C.\nIn this space we introduce the sesquilinear form aN via\naN [u, v] = \u2211 j\u2208M \u03b1j|Bj|(uj \u2212 u0)(vj \u2212 v0), dom(aN) = H N .\nLet AN be the operator in H N associated with this form. It is represented by the (m + 1)\u00d7 (m + 1) symmetric (with respect to the scalar product (3.9)) matrix\nAN =  m \u2211 k=1 \u03b1j|Bj||B0|\u22121 \u2212\u03b11|B1||B0|\u22121 \u2212\u03b12|B2||B0|\u22121 . . . \u2212\u03b1m|Bm||B0|\u22121 \u2212\u03b11 \u03b11 0 . . . 0 \u2212\u03b12 0 \u03b12 . . . 0\n... ...\n... . . . ... \u2212\u03b1m 0 0 . . . \u03b1m\n . (3.10)\nThe matrix of the form (3.10) was investigated in [2]. It was shown that its eigenvalues\n\u03bb1(AN) \u2264 \u03bb2(AN) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03bbm+1(AN) are the zeros of the function \u03bbF(\u03bb), where F(\u03bb) is defined by (2.9). Thus, one has\n\u03bb1(AN) = 0, \u03bbk(AN) = \u03b2k\u22121, k = 2, . . . , m + 1. (3.11)\nOur goal is to show that for k = 1, . . . , m + 1 one has\n\u03bbk(AN\u03b5 )\u2192 \u03bbk(AN) as \u03b5\u2192 0. (3.12)\nThen the desired convergence result (3.8) follows immediately from (3.11)\u2013(3.12). To prove (3.12) we utilize abstract Theorem 3.2. We denote H\u03b5 := L2(Y\u03b5) and introduce the operators RN\u03b5 and RN acting in H\u03b5 and H N , respectively:\nRN\u03b5 := (A N \u03b5 + I) \u22121, RN := (AN + I)\u22121\n(hereinafter I stands for an identity operator). The operators RN\u03b5 , RN are compact, nonnegative, moreover, one has\n\u2016RN\u03b5 \u2016 \u2264 1. (3.13)\nWe denote by {\u00b5Nk,\u03b5}k\u2208N the set of the eigenvalues of RN\u03b5 being renumbered in the descending order and with account of their multiplicity. By virtue of spectral mapping theorem one has\n\u00b5Nk,\u03b5 = (\u03bbk(A N \u03b5 ) + I) \u22121, k \u2208N. (3.14)\nSimilarly, we have\n\u00b5Nk = (\u03bbk(A N) + I)\u22121, k = 1, . . . , m + 1, (3.15)\nwhere 1 = \u00b5N1 \u2265 \u00b5N2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 \u00b5Nm+1 > 0 are the eigenvalues of the operator RN . Finally, we introduce the linear operator J N\u03b5 : H N \u2192H\u03b5 acting on f = ( f0, . . . , fm) as follows,\n(J N\u03b5 f)(x) = { f j, x \u2208 Bj, j \u2208M0, 0, x \u2208 Tj,\u03b5, j \u2208M.\nIt is easy to see that for each f \u2208H N one has\n\u2016J N\u03b5 f\u2016H\u03b5 = \u2016f\u2016H N . (3.16)\nBelow we demonstrate that the operators RN\u03b5 , RN and J N\u03b5 satisfy the conditions (A3) and (A4) of Theorem 3.2 (the other two conditions (A1) and (A2) are fulfilled due to (3.16) and (3.13)); then, by virtue of Theorem 3.2 and Remark 3.3 we get\n\u00b5Nk,\u03b5 \u2192 \u00b5Nk as \u03b5\u2192 0\nfor k = 1, . . . , m + 1, whence, owing to (3.14)\u2013(3.15), the desired convergence (3.12) follows.\nLet us check the fulfillment of (A3). Let f \u2208H N . We denote f\u03b5 := J N\u03b5 f and\nu\u03b5 := RN\u03b5 f\u03b5. (3.17)\nThen AN\u03b5 u\u03b5 + u\u03b5 = f\u03b5, whence, u\u03b5 \u2208 H1(Y\u03b5) and\naN\u03b5 [u\u03b5, v\u03b5] + (u\u03b5, v\u03b5)H\u03b5 = ( f\u03b5, v\u03b5)H\u03b5 , \u2200v\u03b5 \u2208 H1(Y\u03b5). (3.18)\nThe equality (3.18) implies easily the estimate\n\u03b5\u22122\u2016\u2207u\u03b5\u20162L2(Y\u03b5) + \u2016u\u03b5\u2016 2 L2(Y\u03b5) \u2264 \u2016 f\u03b5\u2016 2 L2(Y\u03b5) = \u2016f\u2016 2 H N . (3.19)\nIn particular, it follows from (3.19) that the norms \u2016u\u03b5\u2016H1(Y\u03b5) are uniformly bounded with respect to \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1]. Hence, by virtue of Banach\u2013Alaoglu and Rellich\u2013Kondrachov theorems, there exists a sequence (\u03b5m)m\u2208N with \u03b5m \u2198 0 as m\u2192 \u221e and uj \u2208 H1(Bj), j \u2208M0 such that\n\u2207u\u03b5m \u2192 \u2207uj weakly in L2(Bj), (3.20) u\u03b5m \u2192 uj strongly in L2(Bj), (3.21)\nas m\u2192 \u221e. Furthermore, using (3.19), (3.20), we get \u2016\u2207uj\u20162L2(Bj) \u2264 lim infm\u2192\u221e \u2016\u2207u\u03b5m\u2016L2(Bj) \u2264 limm\u2192\u221e(\u03b5m) 2\u2016f\u2016H N = 0,\nwhence uj are constant functions, and we can regard u = (u0, . . . , um) as the element of H N . Note that (3.21) implies\nlim m\u2192\u221e \u3008u\u03b5m\u3009Bj = \u3008uj\u3009Bj = uj, j \u2208M0. (3.22)\nwhere by \u3008u\u3009B we denote the mean value of the function u(x) over the domain B, i.e.\n\u3008u\u3009B = 1 |B| \u222b B u(x)dx.\nThe same notation will be used further (see (3.26)) for the mean value of a function defined on a subset S of an (n\u2212 1)-dimensional hyperplane, i.e\n\u3008u\u3009S = 1 |S| \u222b S u ds, |S| = \u222b S ds,\nwhere ds stands for the density of the surface measure on S. Let v = (v0, . . . , vm) \u2208H N . We define the function v\u03b5 \u2208 H1(Y\u03b5) via\nv\u03b5(x) := { vj, x \u2208 Bj, j \u2208M0, v0\u2212vj\nhj (xn \u2212 znj ) + v0+vj 2 , x \u2208 Tj,\u03b5, j \u2208M\n(recall that zj = (z\u2032j, z n j ) \u2208 Rn is a point around which we built the passage Tj,\u03b5, see (2.5)). Inserting this v\u03b5 into (3.18), we arrive at the equality\n\u03b5\u22122 \u2211 j\u2208M (\u222b Tj,\u03b5 \u2202u\u03b5 \u2202xn dx ) v0 \u2212 vj hj + \u2211 j\u2208M0 \u3008u\u03b5\u3009Bj vj|Bj|+ \u2211 j\u2208M (u\u03b5, v\u03b5)L2(Tj,\u03b5) = (f, v)H N . (3.23)\nUsing (3.22) we get\nlim m\u2192\u221e \u2211 j\u2208M0 \u3008u\u03b5m\u3009Bj vj|Bj| = \u2211 j\u2208M0 ujvj|Bj| = (u, v)H N , (3.24)\nFurther, one has\n|(u\u03b5, v\u03b5)L2(Tj,\u03b5)| \u2264 \u2016u\u03b5\u2016L2(Tj,\u03b5)\u2016v\u03b5\u2016L2(Tj,\u03b5) \u2264 \u2016u\u03b5\u2016L2(Y\u03b5) max{|vj|; |v0|}|Tj,\u03b5| 1/2,\nwhence, taking into account that \u2016u\u03b5\u2016L2(Y\u03b5) \u2264 \u2016 f \u2016H N and |Tj,\u03b5| \u2192 0, we conclude\nlim \u03b5\u21920 \u2211j\u2208M (u\u03b5, v\u03b5)L2(Tj,\u03b5) = 0. (3.25)\nNow, let us inspect the first term in the left-hand-side of (3.23). We denote by S\u00b1j,\u03b5 the top and bottom faces of the passage Tj,\u03b5, i.e.,\nS\u00b1j,\u03b5 := { x = (x\u2032, xn) \u2208 Rn : xn \u2212 znj = \u00b1hj/2, x\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032j \u2208 \u03b7j,\u03b5Dj } .\nThen, integrating by parts, we obtain:\n\u03b5\u22122 \u2211 j\u2208M (\u222b Tj,\u03b5 \u2202u\u03b5 \u2202xn dx ) v0 \u2212 vj hj = \u03b5\u22122 \u2211 j\u2208M (\u222b S+j,\u03b5 u ds\u2212 \u222b S\u2212j,\u03b5 u ds ) v0 \u2212 vj hj\n= \u2211 j\u2208M\n\u03b1j|Bj| ( \u3008u\u03b5\u3009S+j,\u03b5 \u2212 \u3008u\u03b5\u3009S\u2212j,\u03b5 ) (v0 \u2212 vj) (3.26)\n(on the last step we use |S\u00b1j,\u03b5| = (\u03b7j,\u03b5)n\u22121|Dj| = (\u03b7j)n\u22121\u03b52|Dj| = \u03b1j|Bj|hj\u03b52, see (2.6) and (2.7)). One has the following estimates for j \u2208M:\n|\u3008u\u03b5\u3009S+j,\u03b5 \u2212 \u3008u\u03b5\u3009B0 | 2 \u2264 C\u2016\u2207u\u03b5\u20162L2(B0) \u00b7\n{ (\u03b7k,\u03b5)\n2\u2212n, n \u2265 3, | ln \u03b7k,\u03b5|, n = 2,\n(3.27)\n|\u3008u\u03b5\u3009S\u2212j,\u03b5 \u2212 \u3008u\u03b5\u3009Bj | 2 \u2264 C\u2016\u2207u\u03b5\u20162L2(Bj) \u00b7\n{ (\u03b7k,\u03b5)\n2\u2212n, n \u2265 3, | ln \u03b7k,\u03b5|, n = 2.\n(3.28)\nThe proof is similar to the proof of [18, Lemma 2.1]. From (2.6), (3.19), (3.27), (3.28) we get\n|\u3008u\u03b5\u3009S+j,\u03b5 \u2212 \u3008u\u03b5\u3009B0 | 2 + |\u3008u\u03b5\u3009S\u2212j,\u03b5 \u2212 \u3008u\u03b5\u3009Bj | 2 = { O(\u03b52/(n\u22121)), n \u2265 3 O(\u03b52| ln \u03b5|), n = 2 } \u2192 0 as \u03b5\u2192 0. (3.29)\nUsing (3.22) and (3.29), we finally conclude from (3.26):\nlim m\u2192\u221e\n(\u03b5m) \u22122 \u2211\nj\u2208M (\u222b Tj,\u03b5m \u2202u\u03b5m \u2202xn dx ) v0 \u2212 vj hj = \u2211 j\u2208M \u03b1j|Bj|(u0 \u2212 uj)(v0 \u2212 vj) = aN [u, v]. (3.30)\nCombining (3.23), (3.24), (3.25), (3.30) we arrive at the equality\naN [u, v] + (u, v)H N = (f, v)H N , \u2200v \u2208H N , whence we get\nu = RNf. (3.31)\nThe limiting vector u is independent of the sequence u\u03b5m satisfying (3.20)\u2013(3.21) (u is defined in a unique way by (3.31)), whence we conclude that the whole family u\u03b5 converges to u:\nu\u03b5 \u2192 uj strongly in L2(Bj) as \u03b5\u2192 0, j \u2208M0. (3.32)\nFinally, using (3.17), (3.31) and the definition of the operator J N\u03b5 , we get\n\u2016RN\u03b5 J N\u03b5 f\u2212J N\u03b5 RNf\u20162H\u03b5 = \u2211 j\u2208M0 \u2016u\u03b5 \u2212 uj\u20162L2(Bj) + \u2211 j\u2208M \u2016u\u03b5\u20162L2(Tj,\u03b5). (3.33)\nDue to (3.32) the first term in the right-hand-side of (3.33) tends to zero as \u03b5 \u2192 0. Furthermore, one has the following estimate:\n\u2200u \u2208 H1(Tj,\u03b5 \u222a B0) : \u2016u\u20162L2(Tj,\u03b5) \u2264 C ( \u03b7n\u22121j,\u03b5 \u2016u\u2016 2 L2(B0) + \u03b7j,\u03b5\u03baj,\u03b5\u2016\u2207u\u20162L2(B0) + \u2016\u2207u\u2016 2 L2(Tj,\u03b5) ) , (3.34)\nwhere \u03baj,\u03b5 := 1 as n \u2265 3 and \u03baj,\u03b5 := | ln \u03b7j,\u03b5| as n = 2. The proof of (3.34) is similar to the proof of inequality (5.16) in [3]. It follows from (2.6), (3.19), (3.34) that\n\u2016u\u03b5\u20162L2(Tj,\u03b5) \u2264 C ( \u03b7n\u22121j,\u03b5 \u2016u\u03b5\u2016 2 L2(Y\u03b5) + \u2016\u2207u\u03b5\u2016 2 L2(Y\u03b5) ) \u2264 C1\u03b52\u2016f\u20162H N . (3.35)\nThus the second term in the right-hand-side of (3.33) goes to zero too; consequently, condition (A3) is fulfilled.\nFinally, we check the fulfillment of (A4). Let f\u03b5 \u2208H\u03b5 with \u2016 f\u03b5\u2016H\u03b5 \u2264 C. We set u\u03b5 := RN\u03b5 f\u03b5. (3.36)\nThe function u\u03b5 belongs to H1(Y\u03b5), it satisfies (3.18) and the estimate (3.19) holds true. From this estimate we conclude that there exist a sequence (\u03b5m)m\u2208N with \u03b5m \u2198 0 as m \u2192 \u221e and wj \u2208 H1(Bj), j \u2208M0 such that\nu\u03b5m \u2192 wj strongly in L2(Bj) (3.37) as m\u2192 \u221e; furthermore, the functions wj are constants (so, we can regard w = (w0, . . . , wm) as the element of H N). Also, similarly to (3.35), we get\n\u2016u\u03b5\u20162L2(Tj,\u03b5) \u2264 C\u03b5 2\u2016 f\u03b5\u20162H\u03b5 \u2192 0 as \u03b5\u2192 0. (3.38)\nIt follows from (3.36)\u2013(3.38) and the definition of the operator J N\u03b5 that\n\u2016RN\u03b5m f\u03b5m \u2212J N \u03b5m w\u2016H\u03b5m \u2192 0 as m\u2192 \u221e. Hence condition (A4) is also fulfilled. This completes the proof Lemma 3.4.\nSimilar result holds for the eigenvalues of the operator A\u03b8\u03b5 with \u03b8 = (0, 0, . . . , 0), which corresponds to the periodic conditions on \u2202Y. One has:\n\u03bb1(A\u03b8\u03b5 ) = 0 if \u03b8 = (0, 0, . . . , 0), (3.39)\nwhile for the next eigenvalues one has the following lemma.\nLemma 3.5. Let \u03b8 = (0, 0, . . . , 0). Then for any k \u2208 {2, . . . , m + 1} one has \u03bbk(A\u03b8\u03b5 )\u2192 \u03b2k\u22121, \u03b5\u2192 0.\nThe proof of Lemma 3.5 repeats verbatim the proof of Lemma 3.4. Note that the boundary conditions (3.2) imply no restrictions on the limiting constant u0 (see (3.20)\u2013(3.21)), since any constant function satisfies (3.2) if \u03b8 = (0, 0, . . . , 0).\n3.5. Asymptotic behavior of Dirichlet and antiperiodic eigenvalue problems.\nLemma 3.6. For any k \u2208 {1, . . . , m} one has \u03bbk(AD\u03b5 )\u2192 \u03b1k, \u03b5\u2192 0. (3.40)\nProof. The proof resembles the one of Lemma 3.4, thus we underline only the principal differences. Let H D be the space Cm equipped with the scalar product\n(u, v)H D = \u2211 j\u2208M ujvj|Bj| (3.41)\n(its elements are denoted by bold letters, their entries are enumerated from 1 to m). In the space H D we introduce the sesquilinear form aD via\naD[u, v] = \u2211 j\u2208M \u03b1j|Bj|ujvj, dom(aD) = H D.\nThe associated (with respect to the scalar product (3.41)) operator AD is represented by the m\u00d7m matrix AD = diag(\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1m). Its eigenvalues are given by \u03bb1(AD) \u2264 \u03bb2(AD) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03bbm(AD), and we have\n\u03bbk(AD) = \u03b1k, k = 1, . . . , m. (3.42)\nBelow we demonstrate that for k = 1, . . . , m one has\n\u03bbk(AD\u03b5 )\u2192 \u03bbk(AD) as \u03b5\u2192 0. (3.43) Then the desired convergence result (3.40) follows immediately from (3.42)\u2013(3.43).\nFor the proof of (3.43) we again use Theorem 3.2. As before, we denote H\u03b5 := L2(Y\u03b5), and introduce compact non-negative operators RD\u03b5 := (AD\u03b5 + I)\u22121 and RD := (AD + I)\u22121 acting in H\u03b5 and H D, respectively. One has\n\u2016RD\u03b5 \u2016 \u2264 1. (3.44)\nWe denote by {\u00b5Dk,\u03b5}k\u2208N the set of the eigenvalues of RD\u03b5 being renumbered in the descending order and with account of their multiplicity; similarly, \u00b5D1 \u2265 \u00b5D2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 \u00b5Dm+1 stand for the eigenvalues of the operator RD. One has\n\u00b5Dk,\u03b5 = (\u03bbk(A D \u03b5 ) + I) \u22121, k \u2208N, \u00b5Dk = (\u03bbk(AD) + I)\u22121, k = 1, . . . , m, (3.45)\nFinally, we introduce the operator J D\u03b5 : H D \u2192H\u03b5 acting on f = ( f0, . . . , fm) as follows,\n(J D\u03b5 f)(x) = { f j, x \u2208 Bj, j \u2208M, 0, x \u2208 B0 \u222a ( \u222aj\u2208MTj,\u03b5 ) .\nObviously, for each f \u2208H D we have \u2016J D\u03b5 f\u2016H\u03b5 = \u2016f\u2016H D . (3.46)\nThe conditions (A1) and (A2) of Theorem 3.2 are fulfilled, see (3.44) and (3.46). Let us check the fulfillment of the condition (A3). Let f \u2208H D, f\u03b5 := J D\u03b5 f and\nu\u03b5 := RD\u03b5 f\u03b5. (3.47)\nThen u\u03b5 \u2208 H1(Y\u03b5), u\u03b5 = 0 on \u2202Y, aD\u03b5 [u\u03b5, v\u03b5] + (u\u03b5, v\u03b5)H\u03b5 = ( f\u03b5, v\u03b5)H\u03b5 , \u2200v\u03b5 \u2208 dom(aD\u03b5 ). (3.48)\nand the estimate\n\u03b5\u22122\u2016\u2207u\u03b5\u20162L2(Y\u03b5) + \u2016u\u03b5\u2016 2 L2(Y\u03b5) \u2264 \u2016f\u2016H D (3.49)\nholds true. It follows from (3.49) that the norms \u2016u\u03b5\u2016H1(Y\u03b5) are uniformly bounded with respect to \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1], whence there exists a sequence (\u03b5m)m\u2208N with \u03b5m \u2198 0 as m \u2192 \u221e and the constant functions uj, j \u2208M0 such that (3.20)\u2013(3.21) hold. Moreover, u\u03b5m \u2192 u0 strongly in L2(\u2202Y), hence u0 = 0 a.e. on \u2202Y, and, since u0 is a constant function, we conclude\nu0 \u2261 0. (3.50)\nIn the following we regard u = (u1, . . . , um) as the element of H D. We fix an arbitrary v = (v1, . . . , vm) \u2208H D, and define the function v\u03b5 \u2208 dom(aD\u03b5 ) by\nv\u03b5(x) :=  vj, x \u2208 Bj, j \u2208M, 0, x \u2208 B0, \u2212 vjhj (x n \u2212 znj ) + vj 2 , x \u2208 Tj,\u03b5, j \u2208M.\nInserting v\u03b5 into (3.48), we obtain the equality\n\u2212\u03b5\u22122 \u2211 j\u2208M (\u222b Tj,\u03b5 \u2202u\u03b5 \u2202xn dx ) vj hj + \u2211 j\u2208M \u3008u\u03b5\u3009Bj vj|Bj|+ \u2211 j\u2208M (u\u03b5, v\u03b5)L2(Tj,\u03b5) = (f, v)H D . (3.51)\nRepeating the arguments from the proof of Lemma 3.4 (taking into account (3.50)) we get\n\u2212 lim m\u2192\u221e (\u03b5m) \u22122 \u2211\nj\u2208M (\u222b Tj,\u03b5m \u2202u\u03b5m \u2202xn dx ) vj hj = aD[u, v], (3.52)\nlim m\u2192\u221e \u2211 j\u2208M \u3008u\u03b5m\u3009Bj vj|Bj| = (u, v)H D , lim \u03b5\u21920 \u2211j\u2208M (u\u03b5, v\u03b5)L2(Tj,\u03b5) = 0. (3.53)\nFrom (3.51)\u2013(3.53) we conclude aD[u, v] + (u, v)H D = (f, v)H D , \u2200v \u2208H D, whence\nu = RDf. (3.54)\nThe limiting vector u is independent of a sequence u\u03b5m , whence the whole family u\u03b5 converges to u, namely,\nu\u03b5 \u2192 uj strongly in L2(Bj) as \u03b5\u2192 0. (3.55) Furthermore (cf. (3.35), (3.38)), one has\n\u2211 j\u2208M \u2016u\u03b5\u20162L2(Tj,\u03b5) \u2192 0 as \u03b5\u2192 0. (3.56)\nThe property (A3) follows immediately from (3.47), (3.50), (3.54), (3.55), (3.56) and the definition of the operator J D\u03b5 . The property (A4) is proven similarly (cf. Lemma 3.4).\nBy Theorem 3.2 and Remark 3.3 the fulfillment of the conditions (A1)\u2212 (A4) yield\n\u00b5Dk,\u03b5 \u2192 \u00b5Dk as \u03b5\u2192 0, k = 1, . . . , m, whence, using (3.45), we get the desired convergence (3.43). Lemma 3.6 is proven.\nLemma 3.7. Let \u03b8 /\u2208 (0, 0, . . . , 0). Then for any k \u2208 {1, . . . , m} one has\n\u03bbk(A\u03b8\u03b5 )\u2192 \u03b1k, \u03b5\u2192 0.\nThe proof of Lemma 3.7 is similar to the proof of Lemma 3.6. Here we have to take into account that if u\u03b5 satisfies the boundary conditions (3.2), then (3.20)\u2013(3.21) imply that the limiting constant function u0 satisfies (3.2) too, but for \u03b8 /\u2208 (0, 0, . . . , 0) this is possible only if u0 \u2261 0.\n3.6. End of proof. We denote\n\u03b80 := (0, 0, . . . , 0), \u03b8\u03c0 := (\u03c0, \u03c0, . . . , \u03c0).\nBy virtue of (3.4) and (3.5) we get\n\u03c3(A\u03b5) = \u22c3\nk\u2208N Lk,\u03b5, (3.57)\nwhere the compact intervals Lk,\u03b5 = [`\u2212k,\u03b5, ` + k,\u03b5] satisfy\n\u03bbk(AN\u03b5 ) \u2264 `\u2212k,\u03b5 \u2264 \u03bbk(A \u03b80 \u03b5 ), \u03bbk(A \u03b8\u03c0 \u03b5 ) \u2264 `+k,\u03b5 \u2264 \u03bbk(A D \u03b5 ).\nDue to (3.7) and (3.39) one has\n`\u22121,\u03b5 = 0. (3.58)\nFurthermore, Lemmata 3.4\u20133.5 yield\nlim \u03b5\u21920\n`\u2212k,\u03b5 = \u03b2k\u22121, k = 2, . . . , m + 1, (3.59)\nand Lemmata 3.6\u20133.7 give\nlim \u03b5\u21920 `+k,\u03b5 = \u03b1k, k = 1, . . . , m. (3.60)\nSetting \u03b1k,\u03b5 := `+k,\u03b5, \u03b2k,\u03b5 := ` \u2212 k+1,\u03b5 (k = 1, . . . , m) we conclude from (3.57)\u2013(3.60), (2.10) and Lemma 3.1 the desired properties (2.11)\u2013(2.12). Theorem 2.1 is proven.\n4. Proof of Theorem 2.2\nLet (\u03b1\u0303j)j\u2208M and (\u03b2\u0303 j)j\u2208M be positive numbers satisfying (2.13). We consider the following system of m linear equations with unknowns $j, j = 1, . . . , m:\n1 + m\n\u2211 j=1\n$j \u03b1\u0303j\n\u03b1\u0303j \u2212 \u03b2\u0303k = 0, k = 1, . . . , m. (4.1)\nIt was shown in [17, Lemma 4.1] that the system (4.1) has the unique solution $1, . . . , $m given by\n$j = \u03b2\u0303 j \u2212 \u03b1\u0303j\n\u03b1\u0303j \u220f\ni=1,m|i 6=j\n( \u03b2\u0303i \u2212 \u03b1\u0303j \u03b1\u0303i \u2212 \u03b1\u0303j ) , j \u2208M. (4.2)\nNote that due to (2.13) we have\n\u2200j : \u03b1\u0303j < \u03b2\u0303 j, \u2200i 6= j : sign(\u03b2\u0303i \u2212 \u03b1\u0303j) = sign(\u03b1\u0303i \u2212 \u03b1\u0303j) 6= 0 Consequently, the numbers $j are positive.\nLet \u03b3 > 0. We set\n\u03c4j := $j\n\u03b3n + \u2211 i\u2208M\n$i , j \u2208M,\nwhere $j are given by (4.2). One has\n\u03c4j > 0 and \u2211 i\u2208M \u03c4j < 1. (4.3)\nNow, let Fj, j = 1, . . . , m be hyperrectangles with axes being parallel to the coordinate ones and satisfying\n\u222aj\u2208MFj \u2282 Y, Fi \u2229 Fj = \u2205, i 6= j, |Fj| = \u03c4j. It is easy to see that such a choice is always possible due to (4.3). Let yj \u2208 Fj be the center of the hyperrectangle Fj; then we define\nBj := \u03b3(Fj \u2212 yj) + yj (i.e., Bj is obtained from Fj by a homothety with the center at yj and the ratio \u03b3). In the following we choose \u03b3 < 1, which implies Bj \u2282 Fj. Further, we remove from Fj \\ Bj the set Tj,\u03b5 of the form (2.5); due to the fact that Fj and Bj are two homothetic hyperrectangle with axes being parallel to the coordinate ones, one can always do this in such a way that the assumptions (2.2)\u2013(2.4) are fulfilled.\nWe choose an arbitrary cross-section profile Dj, while the constant \u03b7j in (2.6) are chosen as follows:\n\u03b7j = ( \u03b1\u0303jhj|Bj| |Dj| )1/(n\u22121) .\nWith such a choice of \u03b7j we immediately obtain\n\u03b1j = \u03b1\u0303j, j \u2208M, (4.4) where \u03b1j are defined by (2.7). Moreover, we have\n|Bj| |B0| = \u03b3n|Fj| |Y| \u2212\u2211i\u2208M |Fi| =\n\u03b3n\u03c4j\n1\u2212\u2211i\u2208M \u03c4j = $j. (4.5)\nSince ($1, . . . , $m) is a solution to the system (4.1), we conclude from (4.4) and (4.5) that\n1 + \u2211 j\u2208M \u03b1j|Bj| |B0|(\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b2\u0303k) = 0, k = 1, . . . , m.\nHence \u03b2\u0303 j are zeros of the function F(\u03bb) (see (2.9)), and consequently (taking into account (2.10), (2.13)), we obtain\n\u03b2 j = \u03b2\u0303 j, j \u2208M. Theorem 2.2 is proven.\nAcknowledgment\nThe work of A.K. is partly supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GAC\u030cR) through the project 21-07129S.\nReferences\n[1] J. Arrieta, J. Hale and Q.
