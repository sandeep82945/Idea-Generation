This study aimed to\ninvestigate the mediating influence of self-esteem on family functioning and\nmental health.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study comprised a total of 133 IBD patients who\nwere assessed for family function (APGAR) and depression symptoms. (PHQ-9),\nanxiety symptoms. (GAD-7) and self-esteem (RSES) via self-administered\nquestionnaires. Mediating e ects were tested using the SPSS Process program\nwith bootstrap.\nResults: The total score of PHQ-9 was 7.44 \u00b15.54. The total score of GAD-7\nwas 6.15\u00b1 4.78. Significant associationswere identified among family function,\nself-esteem, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Results revealed a significant\nindirect e ect, suggesting that the e ects of family function on depression\nand anxiety symptoms were mediated by self-esteem; the indirect e ects\npercentages were 41.63 and 29.25.\nConclusion: These results indicate that the family function of IBD patients can\npredict their mental health condition. As self-esteem is a mediating element,\nwhich may have been influenced by family function, mental health status is\nindirectly a ected. Therefore, promoting the self-esteem of IBD patients is\ncrucial for facilitating long-term mental wellness.\nKEYWORDS\ninflammatory bowel disease, family function, self-esteem, depression, anxiety, mediating\nIntroduction\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic and recurrent gastrointestinal illnesses that cause inflammation (1). The prevalence of IBD has increased globally due to changing environmental factors including westernized diets, socio-economic changes (2). With\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nadvances in illness knowledge and diagnostic technology, the number of individuals identified with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has steadily grown, hence increasing the economic burden of IBD (3). Although medications and treatment procedures for IBD are continually being updated and improved, at the current medical level, all that can be accomplished is to extend the remission duration and prognosis of the disease (4). However, IBD is defined by a protracted lifelong course of disease and recurrence, as well as several comorbidities, which frequently result in patients falling into a condition of poor mental health, negatively impacting their quality of life and social abilities. According to a comprehensive study and meta-analysis, the prevalence of anxiety or depressive symptoms in IBD patients was 32.1 and 25.2%, respectively (5). In addition, bidirectional communication via the gutbrain axis, the basis of the psychophysiological susceptibility of IBD patients, may have a detrimental impact on IBD patients\u2019 symptoms, resulting in frequent hospitalizations or high disability rates (6, 7). In other words, a poor state of mental health can imprison people in an ongoing cycle of sickness. Consequently, it is crucial to identify the variables that impact IBD patients\u2019 mental health status and discover measures to enhance mental health status.\nSociodemographic factors, such as gender, age, and income; clinical factors, such as illness type and disease activity; and social factors, such as family function and social support, all influence the mental health status of IBD patients (8, 9). Individuals\u2019 family function is determined by their ability to communicate with family members, fill family roles, accept routines and procedures, manage family stress, and measure family relationships with others (10). Family is regarded as the smallest unit of society, and according to the Chinese cultural notion, it is based on blood connections and family ethics and has complimentary features. Patientsmay thus find their families to be the most accessible source of social support. Research has demonstrated that flourishing family functioning can enhance patient self-efficacy, increase positive coping strategies, and reduce negative psychological states (11, 12). Thus, the family function may be a protective factor for the prognosis of IBD patients, influencing their mental and physical health. In addition, the family function can bring about continuous optimization of prognosis, improve the sense of happiness, and attain a long-term s\u2018 quality of life (13, 14), which supports the notion that family function can bring about continuous optimization of prognosis. Research shows that family function might impact a patient\u2019s mental health. However, earlier research on the effect of family function on the mental health of IBD patients failed to establish the particular mechanism behind this association.\nSelf-esteem is viewed as an internal psychological resource, defined as the entire evaluation of a person\u2019s value. Its composition is founded on the notion of self and self-cognition (15). It is abundantly established that it can enhance the quality\nof life (16). Patients with greater levels of self-esteem may feel more confident and achieve various life objectives to increase their degree of self-recognition, social acknowledgment, and social acceptability, so improving their quality of life. According to a prior study, the stated emotional climate of a patient\u2019s Family (a measure of family emotional climate) moderated the development and expression of paranoid and positive symptoms of early psychosis (17, 18). A study in Taiwan that explored the relationship between family adversity and social anxiety in adolescents found that a decline in family functioning decreased self-esteem (19). Parental conflict is negatively correlated with adolescents\u2019 self-esteem (20). In addition, poor family function has been found in patients with substance use disorders. As a consequence of feeling unsupported by their families, they develop low self-esteem and negative self-perceptions, increasing their likelihood of relapsing (21). In addition, selfesteem is considered a protective factor for the prognosis of IBD, and greater levels of self-esteem are connected with adopting healthier practices more frequently. Similarly, high self-esteem can respond positively to stressful circumstances, lessen the stress of disease, and adapt their mental health (15). Therefore, for quality of life and prognosis, it is crucial to identify the mediation role of self-esteem between family functioning and mental health status in IBD patients. In this study, we evaluated the role of self-esteem as a mediator, which may explain the association between family function and mental health in IBD patients. We hypothesized, based on the preceding information, that (H1) family function is related to mental health status; (H2) family function is related to self-esteem; (H3) self-esteem is related to mental health status, and (H4) selfesteem mediates the relationship between family function and mental health status."

The mean age was 33.13 years with a standard deviation of 12.71 years. Men comprised more than half of the participants (57.1%). Most were diagnosed with UC (72.2%) and had a high school diploma or less (67.7%). In total of 72.9% of patients had medical insurance coverage. In addition, just 48.1% of participants were getting married. In total of 65.4% reported being employed. A fifth of the state\u2019s participants alternate work/school with sick leave (28.6%). The majority of them reside in rural regions (55.7%). The full PHQ9 score was 7.44 \u00b1 5.54, and the total GAD-7 score was 6.15 \u00b1 4.78. We used a score of eight to determine depression, and 61 (45.9%) patients met the cut-off value for the diagnosis of depression (29). After setting score 10 as the cut-off value for the GAD-7, 33 (24.8%) patients were considered to have anxiety (30). The independent sample T-test and ANOVA revealed that illness type, education level, and residence were substantially associated with patients\u2019 depressive and anxious symptoms, respectively.\nCorrelation between family function, mental health status and self-esteem\nAs demonstrated in Table 2, the mean score for GAD7, PHQ-9, self-esteem, and family function were 6.15 (SD 7.48), 7.44 (SD 5.54), 27.96 (SD 4.53), and 6.36 (SD 2.24), respectively. BothGAD-7 and PHQ-9were adversely linkedwith self-esteem (r = \u22120.527, P <0.01; r = \u22120.602, P <0.01) and family function (r = \u22120.532, P <0.01; r = \u22120.506, P <0.01). The relationship between self-esteem and family function is favorable (r = 0.427, P <0.01).\nMediation of self-esteem in the relationship between family function, mental health status\nIndicators of mental health status (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) were chosen as independent factors, whereas family support was chosen as a dependent variable. In the mediation analysis, disease type, education level, and residence were input as covariates.\nFirst of all, after controlling for illness type, education level, and place of residence, the effect of family function on PHQ9 and GAD-7 of IBD patients were analyzed. The total impact was significant (B = \u22121.15, P <0.01; B = \u22121.05, P <0.01). Then, the intermediary role of self-esteem in the influence of family function on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were analyzed. In this step, family function had significant positive and direct effect on depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms (B = 0.84, P <0.01, 95%; B = 0.83, P <0.01). After controlling for variables, the effect of self-esteem on depression and anxiety symptoms (B = \u22120.57, P.01, 95%; B = \u22120.37, P <0.01) was similarly significant. Furthermore, the indirect effect size was calculated using the formula (|a path \u2217 b path/c path|) to determine the predicted proportion of self-esteem in the model. The indirect effect of self-esteem on depression and anxiety symptoms accounts for 41.63 and 29.25%, respectively, indicating that family function can impact mental health status through selfesteem (see Tables 3, 4). From the results above, family function was directly related to PHQ-9 and GAD-7, and it can also affect them through the mediation of self-esteem (see Figure 1)."

There was a strong correlation between low family function and high mental health status among IBD patients. Furthermore, we discovered that self-esteem moderated the impact of family function on mental health status.\nThe full scores for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were similar to those previously seen in Chinese patients with IBD, but higher than in other countries and regions (31, 32). It might be connected to the participant selection procedure. Since all of the participants were recruited during hospitalization, the acute phase of the disease and the inpatient settingmay exacerbate the participants\u2019 anxiety and sadness. Xu\u2019s study also showed that anxiety and depression were significantly higher during the active phase of the disease (32). A lack of financial and medical support for people with inflammatory bowel disease in China may also contribute to their poor mental health (33). In this study, anxiety and depression levels are associated to the patient\u2019s condition, degree of education, and place of living. Regarding illness categories, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores were recorded for CD (5.52 \u00b1 4.62, 6.77 \u00b1 5.29) and UC (7.78 \u00b1 4.86, 9.19 \u00b1 5.86), respectively.\nOn the one hand, it may result from the disease\u2019s impact on UC patients. In Mandel\u2019s investigation of hospitalization rates among IBD patients, the risk of IBD-related hospitalization fell only in CD patients receiving the same treatment (anti-TNF medication) (34).

On the other hand, it may be a result of the increased financial stress UC patients endure. Currently, only CD patients are insured in China, substantially raising the financial burden on UC patients (36). Currently, UC and CD are treated identically, meaning that individuals with UC are more financially pressured owing to Lack of health insurance (37). In addition, work absenteeism andwork impairment due to sickness are significant contributors to patients\u2019 financial stress.\nEven though cohort research revealed that CD has a slightly greater incidence of work impairment than UC (compared to the general population, the RR for CD and UC were 2.0 and 1.8, respectively) (38), patients with UC may confront a more challenging economic condition, which may deteriorate their mental health, given that the existingmedical insurance in China favors CD. Even though the prevalence of IBD is rising year, it is still a relatively uncommon disease in China. Therefore, the patient\u2019s degree of knowledge will impact their acceptance and understanding of this rare condition.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.org\nAdditionally, only metropolitan hospitals offer tailored therapy. For instance, the availability of some specialized medications (e.g., mesalazine, infliximab) and treatment techniques (eg., fecal transplantation). Patients from rural areas must travel back and forth to receive therapy, which raises their financial and psychological burdens. Because there are still issues in the differential diagnosis of IBD and extraintestinal symptoms may predate the time of diagnosis (39), we did not limit the duration of IBD throughout the recruiting procedure. A comprehensive review and meta-analysis indicated that only five of the 11 included research found a correlation between a depressed state and disease progression (40).\nWe analyzed family function, and the overall score was 6.36 \u00b1 2.24, indicating that, in general, the family function of IBD patients we studied is mild to moderately dysfunctional. This may be owing to the high expenditures on sickness treatment, which have exacerbated family tensions and led to dysfunctional households (36). According to Dibley\u2019s research (41), the stigma associated with kinship and the unfavorable views of family members affects family functioning. Furthermore, familial stigma has amore significant harmful impact than other kinds of stigma (41). Furthermore, stigma has various aspects since it will be stigmatized by the public and family members (42, 43). Our study demonstrated a substantial negative connection between family function, anxiety, and depression symptoms (44). In IBD patients, family functioning is essential to mental health improvement. Families are viewed as the most acceptable source of social support in Chinese culture because of the links of blood ties. By offering psychological and behavioral support and training family members on problem-solving approaches and tactics, patients with IBD can lower the chance of developing a\npoor mental state. This is congruent with the family ecosystem hypothesis, which asserts that the family system significantly impacts the psychological development of family members (45). Consequently, the higher the degree of family function, the greater the level of family members\u2019 physical and mental health and adaptation (46).\nComparable to other studies (15) the average self-esteem score among IBD patients in our study is 27.96 \u00b1 4.53. This study demonstrates that family function positively predicts selfesteem. A higher level of family function increases one\u2019s selfesteem. A bad family environment might harm the patient\u2019s recovery because family care makes the sufferer feel valued and involved. The study also demonstrates a negative correlation between self-esteem, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. In addition, depressive and anxiety disorders often co-occur with IBD, showing that self-esteem is connected to anxiety and depression symptoms. Multiple ideas postulate that self-esteem may serve as a buffer against anxiety and depressive symptoms. According to the vulnerability model, based on the diathesisstress framework, negative self-evaluations are a risk factor for developing depressive symptoms (47, 48). In addition, the tripartite model predicted that depression symptoms would have a greater relationship with self-esteem than anxiety symptoms, which was supported by the findings of this study (49, 50). It suggests that a boost in self-esteemmay be a preventive measure that minimizes anxiety and depression symptoms.\nThis is the first study to elucidate how family functioning influences the mental health status of IBD patients. This may provide future insight on how to enhance the mental health of IBD patients. The most notable finding was that selfesteem significantly mediated the relationship between family\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Mediating role of self-esteem on the relationships between family function and mental health status.\nfunction and mental health status. This suggests that boosting a patient\u2019s self-esteem may enhance their mental health, such as through cognitive behavior therapy or human imagery intervention (51, 52). IBD patients experience uncomfortable bowel symptoms (e.g., intestinal sounds, farting, bowel urgency). Those who get specific therapies frequently experience changes in appearance (e.g., wearing a nasogastric tube or developing a fistula) and limited social adaptation, resulting in low selfesteem. From a social psychology viewpoint (15), the poor self-esteem of IBD patients might result in unpleasant feelings and low life satisfaction (53). Studies have demonstrated that families may give physical and mental comfort to ailing family members through information, reward, emotional, and tool support (54). Therefore, IBD patients will feel appreciated, needed, and cared for by their family members, which will boost their sense of self-worth. This study\u2019s model of the mediating impact elucidates the significance of self-esteem in the transfer of family function and the development of a high-level mental health condition. Notably, healthcare providers should be aware that family-centered therapies might enhance the mental health status of IBD patients by fostering self-esteem.\nEven regular interaction with the patient is insufficient for family members to comprehend the disease\u2019s complexities (55). Therefore, most family members tend to disregard the psychological sentiments of patients while assisting them with food and behavior management. However, despite feeling supportive, the Family may unintentionally stigmatize the individual with IBD. Since incorrect or excessive caring may have a detrimental effect on self-esteem. Healthcare\nprofessionals (HCPs) should be aware that family-centered treatments might enhance the mental health of IBD patients by enhancing their self-esteem. Helping patients with IBD by normalizing illness within the Family can benefit HCPs. Chronically sick people may interpret the normalization of a family as minimizing or hiding their condition. For instance, the dyadic communication intervention for sickness comprises family members\u2019 psychological adjustment and support techniques (56). Since IBD is a chronic condition, the familial adaption process will continue to advance. Understanding the context of IBD for the patient and Family might be facilitated by familiarity with unique patient difficulties. Enhancing the Family\u2019s internal environment is conducted in the context of the patient\u2019s overall care. Financial toxicity of illness treatment was prevalent, resulting in cost-related pharmaceutical non-adherence or even previous therapy to not add to the Family\u2019s financial burden (57). Consequently, consideration should be given to implementing medical insurance coverage for IBD patients while coping with economic difficulties or when employment serves as a buffer or diversion from financial stress.\nFacing an expanding IBD population. Understanding the association between family function and mental health status might help HCPs identify areas that may need to be addressed to improve IBD patients\u2019 prognosis. In addition, it is required to design a method for measuring family function that can be used to IBD patients while taking the self-esteem dimension into account so that precise intervention measures may be taken. Significantly, considerable improvements will only result if these\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 07 frontiersin.org\nresults are recognized by treatments and implemented in the clinic."
