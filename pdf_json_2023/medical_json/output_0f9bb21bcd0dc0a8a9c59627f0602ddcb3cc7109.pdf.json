            "text": "Optical communication in space and from space to ground is becoming increasingly important in order to fulfill requirements on larger band-width and global availability for vast amounts of data [1]. While radio-frequency (RF) links have so far been able to deliver most of the communication needs, they will not be able to keep up with the growing demand. As optical links offer the prospect of much higher channel capacity and transmission speed compared to RF links, they are likely to succeed or at least complement traditional RF communication systems in many applications [2]. Numerous missions during the past two decades spear-headed the initial technology developments and paved the way for increasingly robust link deployments (see e.g. [1, 3\u20136], and an overview in [2, 7]). As an added benefit, optical links are more secure [1] because the transmitted beams have narrow divergence angles and are targeted to a comparatively small region so that they cannot be easily intercepted. However, this benefit turns out to be a major disadvantage when it comes to establishing the link in the first place. The small beam-width makes it difficult to \u201chit\u201d the receiver with the transmitted beam, considering that the uncertainties in the beam pointing are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the beam width, unless a dedicated wide field search beacon is used. For this reason, the \u201cinitial beam acquisition\u201d is one of the most critical challenges for optical communication and a robust acquisition the pre-requisite for successful deployment of optical links."

            "text": "This section gives a short description of a typical acquisition process as background information (see e.g. [7] for details). Owing to the large uncertainty of the position of the receiving spacecraft (SC) and the direction of the optical transmission axis, the transmitting SC1 performs a search scan of the uncertainty region by guiding the transmitted beam along an Archimedean spiral. The receiving SC2, indicated by the small black circle of Fig. 1(a), is located somewhere in this region in between two spiral tracks which are separated by the track width Dt. SC2 is assumed to detect the beam if its distance to the beam center is smaller than the radius of detection Rd. In order to guarantee good coverage of the scanning area, the track width Dt is chosen such that there is an overlap OV = 2Rd \u2212 Dt between the beam footprints (red-shaded area) on adjacent tracks which must be sufficiently large to account for deviations from the nominal path due to beam jitter. When the scanning beam sweeps across the location of SC2 in the uncertainty plane, SC2 is assumed to detect it with sufficient accuracy (e.g. on a matrix detector) to re-orient its transmitted beam in the direction of the received light. As soon as SC1, which has meanwhile continued scanning the uncertainty region, receives the transmitted beam from SC2, it stops scanning and likewise re-directs its transmitted beam into the direction of the received light from SC2. Once both SC have spatially acquired the received beams of their counterpart, one SC may lock its laser to the frequency of the received light through a phase-locked loop in order to facilitate coherent data transmission. ar X iv :2 30 2.\n09 08\n0v 1\n[ ee\nss .S\nP] 1\n8 Fe\nb 20\n23\nn+1\nTrack n Track n+1\nSC\nBeam offset\nx\nSC\nxt\nXn Xn+1 x\nxt\nx\nxt\nDt\nRd\nn\nSearch Spiral"

            "text": "For optical link acquisition, the scanning beam of SC 1 is typically moved along an Archimedean search spiral with constant angular velocity, covering the uncertainty distribution of the receiving SC2 from the center to the maximum scan radius (see e.g.[6, 8\u201312]). Considering the Gaussian profile of the uncertainty distribution (see section 2A), the regions of higher probability are scanned before those of lower probability, making the Archimedean spiral a very efficient choice. A detailed comparison between spiral, raster, Lissajous, and Rose search patterns is given in [13].\nPrevious analytical models to compute the probability of acquisition failure (Pf ail) ignored correlations of the beam jitter, although this is a dominating effect for fast scanning terminals, which motivates the development of an entirely new analytical model in this paper. Below, important aspects that characterize acquisition models are summarized:\n1. Neglecting tangential jitter: In order to simplify the derivation of an analytical model, it is often sufficient to account for radial jitter only (across the spiral track). Neglecting the tangential degree-of-freedom (dof) is valid as long as the total jitter root-mean-square (RMS) does not exceed the beam diameter [14]. The authors of [8] included the tangential dof in the derivation of an analytical model, but this comes at the expense of much more sophisticated mathematics with little benefit in terms of accuracy. In fact, it has been shown that the results of Monte Carlo simulations yield almost identical results if radial jitter alone is applied compared to the case where radial and tangential jitter are applied[14, 15]. These simulations also were in close agreement to predictions of a 1-dimensional (1d) analytical model [16] that only accounts for radial jitter, which further verified the validity of neglecting tangential jitter.\n2. Model dimensionality: Using a 1d analytical model for\nthe acquisition probability of failure Pf ail also amounts to assuming that the radius of curvature of the tracks does not enter the computation of Pf ail . This further implies that the computed failure probability for a specific SC location in between two tracks n and n+1 does not depend on the value of n but only on the radial offset \u2206r from track n, which is exactly what was observed in [8] and proven by the close match of 2d Monte Carlo simulations to the predictions of a 1d analytical model in [14].\n3. Uncertainty distribution between tracks: As the uncertainty distribution of where to find the SC in the scanning plane is generally changing only slowly on the scale of the track-width Dt, it can be approximated to be constant and given by its mean value in between any two tracks n and n+1. In fact, it can be shown that probabilities calculated with this approximation are exact for changes up to linear order of the uncertainty distribution. Therefore, the total probability of failure Pf ail can be found by integrating the conditional probability of missing the scanning beam for a given offset xt from track n over a uniform density in between the two tracks [16]. A recent paper [12] suggested to improve the accuracy of the calculation by piecewise integration of the conditional probability over all track pairs, density weighted by the exact shape of the uncertainty distribution in each segment. However, as can be seen in Fig. 2, there is no noticeable difference between the results of the much more involved approach of [12](red crosses) and the original model of [16] (blue line). The latter model yields accurate results, if the width of the uncertainty distribution \u03c3uc is larger than Dt, which is the case for all conceivable mission scenarios.\n4. Detection on multiple tracks: Previous models [8, 9] have not accounted for the fact that if the SC fails to detect the jittering beam on the scanning track closest to it, there is still a reasonable chance it may detect it on one of the adjacent tracks. In fact, accounting for this possibility is extremely important as this effect typically dominates the predicted probability of failure. This effect was first included in a model where detection may occur on either track n or track n+1 (\u201c2-track model\u201d) which is accurate for small jitter and if the track width Dt is larger than the radius of detection Rd [16]. For larger jitters and/or narrower track widths, the model must be extended to account for potential detection of up to N neighboring tracks (\u201cN-track model\u201d) [14]. This is also demonstrated in Fig. 2 which shows that the probability of failure for the \u201cN-track model\u201d (black curve) deviates from the one for the \u201c2-track model\u201d (blue curve) at small track widths, and the deviations are greater for larger RMS jitter (\u03c3n = 25.00 \u00b5rad) than for small jitter (\u03c3n = 15.85 \u00b5rad).\n5. Beam detection model: Previous analyses [8, 9, 16] assumed that the scanning beam is detected by the SC if the distance between the beam center and the SC is smaller than the radius of detection Rd at any any time during the spiral scan. This detection model is referred to as the \u2018Hard-Sphere Model\u201d (HSM), due to its simple geometric interpretation (see also Fig. 1). It is remarkable that the HSM, which combines all detection characteristics in a single parameter (Rd), yields very similar results to those of (much more sophisticated) physically representative models which simulate the integration across the actual beam\nintensity distribution during a finite integration time and account for detector noise sources and a detection threshold corresponding to a specific signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) [14, 15]. Unfortunately, this agreement breaks-down if RMS amplitude and band-width of the beam jitter are very large [14]. However, the HSM is fully applicable to the parameter regime covered in this paper.\n6. Jitter correlation effects: The \u201cN-track model\u201d yields accurate predictions in agreement to those of Monte Carlo simulations as long as certain assumptions on the jitter correlation are met. These assumptions are (1) that the jitter is correlated on a time-scale of the beam passage time Tpass during which the scanning beam sweeps over the SC location and (2) that the jitter between two adjacent tracks is uncorrelated, i.e. the jitter is uncorrelated on the time-scale of one spiral revolution Trev, which may be expressed as an inequality for the width of the jitter auto-correlation function \u03c40 as follows: Tpass < \u03c40 < Trev. As discussed in [15], the actual failure rate Pf ail drops below the one predicted by the \u201cN-track\u201d model for \u03c40 < Tpass (as integration windows become uncorrelated) and for \u03c40 > Trev (as jitter between tracks becomes correlated).\nIt is interesting to compare the regime of validity between the \u201cN-track model\u201d and the analytical model of [8] which the authors specifically applied to the European Data Relay System (EDRS). In their model, the authors assumed white Gaussian noise of unlimited bandwidth for the beam jitter which has the following consequences: (1) Unlimited band-width implies infinitely small correlation times so that the primary effect discussed in this paper, the impact of jitter correlations between tracks, cannot emerge, no matter how fast the beam is scanning. (2) Infinitely small correlation times also imply that the jitter fluctuations which occur within one integration window become uncorrelated with the jitter fluctuations of all other integration windows during Tpass. This leads to much lower compound failure probabilities than for the \u201cN-track model\u201d, where fluctuations are assumed correlated between the windows and jitter displacements are almost equal for all windows during Tpass. The model in [8] therefore applies under the condition that \u03c40 Tpass < Trev. However, for an optical communication mission with a comparatively stable platform, such as the one of SILEX [7], and an optical terminal scanning close to its maximum speed [10], the rather opposite regime applies."

For simplicity, the model is restricted to the case where detection may occur either on track \u2019n\u2019 or track \u2019n+1\u2019 (\u201c2-track model\u201d), thus requiring that the RMS jitter is smaller than the radius of detection and the track-width (\u03c3n < Rd, Dt). Using this model, the impact of increasing correlations, e.g. due to increasing scan speed, on the probability of failure Pf ail is accurately calculated. Discussing the model predictions for realistic parameters in section 3A, it becomes apparent that for fast scan speeds the emerging correlations may reduce Pf ail by orders of magnitude, which is a dominating effect that is not accounted for by previous analytical models. Remarkably good agreement is found between the analytical model predictions and Monte Carlo simulations which confirm the model validity and the\n40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80\nTrack Width [\u00b5rad]\n10-2\n10-1\n2-track model 2-track model, modified\nN-track model\nsn=15.85 \u00b5rad\nsn=25 \u00b5rad\ninterpretation with respect to correlation effects. In section 3C it is demonstrated how the value of a single compound parameter (which only depends on scan speed, bandwidth of the jitter spectrum, and width of the uncertainty distribution) fully determines the impact of correlations which is compared to the uncorrelated case using a dedicated performance metric. Finally, the optimal spiral track-width and associated beam overlap which minimize the mean acquisition search time are determined for a given scan speed in section 3D, accounting for the possibility that a scan is repeated in case of failure."

In practice, a number of errors affect the pointing, among which the primary groups are knowledge errors of the transceiver optical axis with respect to the SC reference frame (caused by calibration error and\nground-to-orbit shifts), ephemeris and orbit determination errors, and SC attitude knowledge errors. Certain instabilities, such as thermo-elastic drifts, may affect both, the alignment of the SC attitude sensor (impacting the SC attitude knowledge error), and the alignment of the transceiver optical axis (impacting the optical axis error). All errors are typically combined by adding their respective variances, assuming that the underlying effects are uncorrelated, to find the total variance \u03c32uc which is assumed to be identical for azimuth and elevation angles. The uncertainty distribution is then found as the product of two normal distributions (one for each angle), which can be represented by a Rayleigh distribution along the radial direction of the uncertainty plane [17]:\nPDFuc(r) = r \u03c32uc e \u2212 r2 2\u03c32uc , (1)"

            "text": "In this section an analytical expression is derived for the acquisition probability of failure Pf ail in the presence of beam jitter that is correlated in between tracks. This derivation generalizes the one presented in [16] by accounting for the effect of correlations, which allows to accurately predict the dependency of the probability of failure Pf ail on the scan speed \u03b3 and and normalized jitter auto-correlation function rxx(\u03c4). Qualitative arguments for why such a dependency exists were previously provided in [14]. These arguments were motivated to some extent by analyzing the results of Monte Carlo simulations, but the assumptions could not be directly verified. In contrast, in this paper the direct parametric relationship is obtained between the acquisition failure rate and the physical system parameters through the derivation of an ab initio model whose predictions are found to be in excellent agreement to those of Monte Carlo simulations. For the derivation it is assumed that the SC is located at a random position Xt in between two tracks n and n+1 of the search spiral, where the coordinate system x starts at track n and radially points towards track n+1 (see Fig. 1a). As discussed in section 1B, the SC uncertainty distribution only changes slightly and can therefore assumed to be constant in between the two tracks, if \u03c3uc > Dt. The probability density function u(xt) is then given by:\nu(xt) = 2\nDt 0 \u2264 xt \u2264 Dt/2 (4)\nNote that because of the underlying symmetry of this model it is only necessary to consider potential locations of the SC in between [0, Dt/2] instead of [0, Dt], which slightly reduces the computational effort. As discussed in section 1B, the error made by assuming a constant density in this small interval is completely negligible for a typical mission scenario. The jittering beam can only be detected on either track n or track n+1 with reasonable probability, provided that the jitter is sufficiently small and the track width sufficiently large compared to the beam radius of detection Rd. If the jitter becomes larger and/or the track width becomes narrower, there is a chance that the large jitter excursions lead to a detection on tracks with a larger radial distance (e.g. tracks n-1 or n+2), in which case the \u201c2-track model\u201d, originally introduced in [16], must be extended to \u201cN-tracks\u201d, as shown in [14]. The event that the scanning beam is not detected on track n shall be referred to as event A and that it is not detected on track n+1 as event B, respectively. Quite generally, the beam is said to be detected if the distance between the beam center and the location of the SC is smaller than the radius of detection Rd. Jitter fluctuations that occur while the beam is passing by the SC on track n are modeled by a random variable Xn which follows a normal distribution of zero mean and variance \u03c32n : Xn \u223c N (0, \u03c32n). The associated probability density function (PDF) is given by\ng(xn) = 1\u221a 2\u03c0\u03c3n e \u2212 x\n2 n\n2\u03c32n (5)\nSimilarly, fluctuations that occur after one spiral revolution, while the beam is passing by the SC on the adjacent track n+1, are modeled by an identically distributed random variable Xn+1 \u223c N (0, \u03c32n). Based on the above definitions, the following\nprobabilistic equations for events A and B can be derived [16]:\nP(A) = P(Xn > Rd \u2212 Xt) P(B) = P(Xn+1 < Dt \u2212 Rd \u2212 Xt). (6)\nThe total probability P(A and B) that the scanning beam is neither detected on track n nor on track n+1 is derived considering that Eqs. 6 are correlated through the SC position Xt as well as the jitter fluctuations Xn, Xn+1 for which the general assumption is that \u3008XnXn+1\u3009 6= 0. Note that jitter fluctuations are generally correlated, if the width \u03c40 of the normalized jitter auto-correlation function rxx(\u03c4) is larger than the mean spiral revolution time Tmean:\n\u03c40 > Tmean. (7)\nFrom the spectrum given in Eq.2 the normalized auto-correlation function is found to decay exponentially and its 1/e width \u03c40 is determined[14]:\nrxx(\u03c4) = e \u2212 |\u03c4|\u03c40 , (8)\n\u03c40 := 1\n2\u03c0 fr . (9)\nThe mean radial distance of the SC is found from the uncertainty distribution of Eq. 1 to be Rmean = \u221a \u03c0/2\u03c3uc from which the mean spiral revolution time is obtained:\nTmean = 2\u03c0Rmean\n\u03b3 =\n\u221a \u03c0\n2 2\u03c0\u03c3uc \u03b3 . (10)\nInserting Eqs. 10 and 9 into Eq. 7, an expression for the minimum scan speed \u03b3min is obtained where correlation effects between tracks n and n+1 should emerge [14]\n\u03b3min = fr \u221a \u03c0/2 (2\u03c0)2 \u03c3uc, (11)\nwhich is evaluated to be \u03b3min = 14 mrad/s for the default mission parameters of Table 1. Considering the correlations between Eqs. 6, the conditional probability is derived that event A occurs given that the SC is at a certain location Xt = xt and the jitter fluctuation on track n has a size Xn = xn:\nP(A|Xt = xt, Xn = xn) = H (xn \u2212 (Rd \u2212 xt)) , (12)\nwhere H(x) is the Heaviside function. Integrating the conditional probability over the density functions for Xn and Xt the probability P(A) is obtained that the SC is not detected on track n:\nP(A) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dxng(xn) \u222b Dt/2 0 dxt 2 Dt H (xn \u2212 (Rd \u2212 xt))\n= 2\nDt \u222b Dt/2 0 dxt 1 2 erfc ( Rd \u2212 xt\u221a 2\u03c3n ) (13)\nIn order to calculate the probability P(B) that the SC is not detected on track n+1 it is now considered that the jitter on track n+1, described by the random variable Xn+1, is correlated with the jitter Xn on track n. Therefore, Xn+1 is decomposed into a contribution of amplitude \u03b4r that is fully correlated with Xn and a contribution Xn,\u22a5 of amplitude er = (1\u2212 \u03b42r )1/2 that is orthogonal to Xn and also follows a normal distribution Xn,\u22a5 \u223c N (0, \u03c32n). To this end, the correlation amplitude \u03b4r is found from the normalized auto-correlation function of Eq. 8 that must\nbe evaluated for the spiral revolution time on track n which is assumed to have a radius r:\n\u03b4r = rxx(2\u03c0r/\u03b3) = e\u2212\u03b2r (14)\n\u03b2 := (2\u03c0)2 fr\n\u03b3 . (15)\nThis yields: Xn+1 = \u03b4rXn + erXn,\u22a5. (16)\nThe conditional probability P(B) of not detecting the scanning beam on track n+1, given that the SC is at a certain location Xt = xt and the jitter fluctuation on track n has a size Xn = xn, is found to be:\nP(B|Xt = xt, Xn = xn) = P(\u03b4rxn + erXn,\u22a5 < Dt \u2212 Rd \u2212 xt)\n= P(Xn,\u22a5 < 1 er (Dt \u2212 Rd \u2212 xt \u2212 \u03b4rxn))\n= \u222b 1 er (Dt\u2212Rd\u2212xt\u2212\u03b4r xn)\n\u2212\u221e dxn,\u22a5g(xn,\u22a5)\n= 1 2\nerfc (\nRd \u2212 Dt + xt + \u03b4rxn er \u221a 2\u03c3n\n) (17)\nThe total probability P(A and B) is then found by integrating the product of the conditional probabilities of Eqs. 12,17 over the marginal variables xt and xn which must be weighted by their respective density functions u(xt) and g(xn), given in Eqs. 4 and 5, respectively:\nPf ail(\u03b4r) = P(A and B) = \u222b Dt/2\n0 dxt 2 Dt \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dxn [g(xn)P(A|Xt = xt, Xn = xn)\n\u00d7P(B|Xt = xt, Xn = xn)]\n= 2\nDt \u222b Dt/2 0 dxt \u222b \u221e Rd\u2212xt dxng(xn) 1 2 erfc ( Rd \u2212 Dt + xt + \u03b4rxn er \u221a 2\u03c3n ) ,\n(18)\nwhere the dependency of the failure rate Pf ail(\u03b4r) on the correlation amplitude \u03b4r of Eq. 14 is explicitly noted. The latter depends itself on the spiral radius r of track n. However, as the SC could be located at any radius r, the average of Eq. 18 must be taken over the SC uncertainty distribution of Eq. 1 to obtain the average probability of failure:\nPf ail,av = \u222b \u221e\n0 drPf ail (\u03b4r) r \u03c32uc e \u2212 r2 2\u03c32uc (19)\nAs mentioned in section 1B, there is no improvement in accuracy to be gained if the density function of the SC location xt is not assumed to be constant but given by the exact Rayleigh distribution when performing the integral over xt in Eq. 18, as the Rayleigh distribution is only slightly changing over the short distance between tracks and linear changes are averaged out. However, the correlation amplitude \u03b4r for a given spiral radius greatly reduces towards larger radii, which in turn leads to strongly increasing failure rates. Therefore, it is very important to average the dependency of the failure rate on \u03b4r across the uncertainty distribution as done in Eq. 19. It is also possible to calculate the mean correlation amplitude \u03b4mean which is defined as the average of \u03b4r over the uncertainty distribution. Using \u03b4mean to evaluate Pf ail(\u03b4mean) through Eq. 18 yields probabilities of failure that are quite close to those obtained from Eq. 19."

(20)\nThis means that acquisition only fails if there is no overlap between beams on adjacent tracks, i.e. if OV = 2Rd \u2212 Dt < 0. If, on the contrary, there is an overlap and 2Rd \u2212 Dt > 0, it follows that acquisition must always succeed and Pf ail = 0, irrespective of all other physical parameters such as the jitter power. This result can be understood when considering that fully correlated jitter on adjacent tracks amounts to a bias offset, i.e. a constant displacement of the beam from the nominal track, which has no impact on the probability of failure, as shown in Fig. 1(b). It is only bias drifts which lead to failure [14]. The other extreme of uncorrelated jitter between tracks implies that \u3008XnXn+1\u3009 = 0 and therefore \u03b4r = 0 and er = 1.

            "text": "In this section the derived analytical models are evaluated for the given mission configuration parameters of Table 1, unless specified otherwise, and the analytical predictions are compared to the results of Monte Carlo simulations. The observed effects and the validity of previous assumptions are discussed in detail with the aim to give a comprehensive understanding of all correlation effects in this parameter regime.\nA. Variation of the scan speed Fig. 3 shows how Pf ail,av drops with increasing scan speed from an initial value of \u223c 4.5% for scan speeds well below 10 mrad/s to a value of \u223c 0.1% for a scan speed of 100 mrad/s. When the scanning beam misses the SC on a certain track due to a large jitter excursion towards an adjacent track, it has a higher probability of hitting the SC on the adjacent track if the excursion persists for at least one spiral revolution (see Fig. 1b). Such jitter correlations between tracks increase with scan speed as the mean spiral revolution time becomes increasingly shorter and falls below the jitter correlation time (see Eq. 7). The black solid line of Fig. 3 corresponds to the predictions of Eq. 19 and is in remarkably good agreement to the results from Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations were performed with a Hard-Sphere detection Model (HSM) where the beam is assumed to be detected by the SC if the distance between the beam center and the SC is smaller than the radius of detection Rd at any any time during the spiral scan. In order to simulate the jitter excursions from the nominal track, the jitter spectrum of Eq. 2 was either applied along radial direction alone (1 dof, blue triangles), or along radial and tangential direction (2 dof, red squares). As also concluded in previous studies [14, 15], it is observed that the results of 1 dof and 2 dof are very close, indicating that tangential jitter has no significant impact on Pf ail . This can be intuitively explained by considering that slowly varying tangential displacements will only slightly delay or advance the point in time when the beam passes by the SC, which should have little impact on Pf ail . The assumption that tangential jitter can be neglected was also discussed in section 1B and implicitly considered in the derivation of the \u201c1d model\u201d in section 2D, where only beam displacements in radial direction of the uncertainty plane are accounted for. It is observed that in the limit of very low scan speeds the correlated analytical model prediction (solid black line) converges to the \u201cuncorrelated limit\u201d (dashed black line) predicted by Eq. 21. This is expected, because with decreasing scan speed the mean revolution time Tmean increases according to Eq. 10 and becomes larger than the jitter correlation time \u03c40, which implies that jitter fluctuations between tracks become uncorrelated. The blue dotted line is computed from the analytical approximation Pf ail(\u03b4mean) which is obtained by evaluating Eq. 18 for the mean correlation amplitude \u03b4mean. As can be seen in the figure, this approximation is reasonably close to the exact prediction (black solid line) but does not agree nearly as well with the results of\nResearch Article Applied Optics 7\nUncorrelated limit\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\no f\nFa\nilu\nre\n10-3\n10-2\nScan speed [\u00b5rad/s] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 104\nMonte Carlo, HSM 1 dof\nMonte Carlo, HSM 2 dof\nAnalytical, Exact\nAnalytical, Mean Correlat ion\nAnalytical, Linear\nAnalytical, Uncorrelated\nthe Monte Carlo simulation. The dashed blue curve is derived from the linearized analytical model which agrees well with the predictions of the exact model for lower scan speeds but starts diverging for larger scan speeds, where correlation amplitudes increase and the linear approximation breaks down. Finally, it is interesting to note that the Monte Carlo simulation results for the lowest scan speed (\u03b3 = 2 mrad/s) are clearly offset from the analytical prediction while the results for larger scan speeds match almost perfectly. This deviation is not a statistical outlier, as one might mistakenly conclude, but the consequence of the fact that for very low scan speeds another regime is entered. It was already mentioned in section 1B that in this regime the jitter fluctuations become uncorrelated on a time-scale shorter than the beam passage time Tpass, which reduces the failure rates with respect to the predictions of the \u201c2-track model\u201d of Eq. 21. More detailed investigations of this effect, which are outside the scope of this paper, are given in [15].\nB. Variation of the track-width\nIn order to verify the accuracy of the analytical model of Eq. 19, the variation of Pf ail,av was studied over a range of track-widths from Dt = Rd to Dt = 2Rd, which is shown in Fig. 4. Remarkably good agreement is found again between the predictions of the correlated analytical model (black solid lines) and the results of Monte Carlo simulations for radial jitter (blue triangles) and radial as well as tangential jitter (red squares). Simulations were made for scan speeds of \u03b3 = 10 mrad/s and \u03b3 = 40 mrad/s, where the mean correlation amplitudes are given by \u03b4mean = 0.30 and \u03b4mean = 0.71, respectively. Both curves indicate that the probability of failure increases strongly with increasing trackwidth, as expected. However, the curve for the lower scan speed (\u03b3 = 10 mrad/s) is closer to the uncorrelated limit predicted by Eq. 21 (black dashed line) because the mean correlation amplitude is smaller.

This can be be readily proven by considering that the probability of failure depends on correlations through \u03b4r which is itself a function of r fr/\u03b3 (see Eq. 14). Introducing the dimensionless variable r\u0303 = r/\u03c3uc in the integral of Eq. 19 yields Pf ail,av = \u222b \u221e\n0 dr\u0303Pf ail (r\u0303\u03c3uc fr/\u03b3) r\u0303e\n\u2212 r\u030322 = \u222b \u221e\n0 dr\u0303Pf ail (r\u0303/\u03b7) r\u0303e\n\u2212 r\u030322 ,\n(25) which explicitly shows the dependency of Pf ail,av on the compound parameter \u03b7.

Therefore, the performance is expected to improve and Fe f f is expected to increase with the correlation parameter \u03b7. This is what is observed in Fig. 5 which plots Fe f f against probability of failure for 4 different scan speeds. For example, in order to obtain a failure probability of 1%, the track width is increased by a factor Fe f f = 1.51 for \u03b3 = 40 mrad/s and by Fe f f = 1.67 for \u03b3 = 100 mrad/s with respect to the case that no correlations are present."

Designing the acquisition search for a low probability of failure Pf ail (of a single scan) in presence of jitter requires choosing a narrow track width Dt, which increases the mean search time for a single successful scan given by T1s = 2\u03c0\u03c32uc/(Dt\u03b3) [16]. Choosing a larger track-width increases Pf ail , which may require performing another scan if the beam has not been detected during the entire scan across the uncertainty region of radius Ruc. This also increases the mean search time for multiple scans Tms which accounts for the total time required if a search scan must be repeated due to failure. Therefore, for best performance, the right balance between two counter-acting effects must be found: if the trackwidth increases (or, alternatively, the beam overlap decreases), T1s decreases on the one hand, but Pf ail increases on the other hand. The authors of [11] derived an expression for Tms. After some re-arrangements it is found to essentially depend on T1s and Pf ail as follows [15]:\nTms = T1s\n( 1 +\nF2uc 2 Pf ail 1\u2212 Pf ail\n) , (27)\nwhere the factor Fuc = Ruc/\u03c3uc relates the radius of the scan region to the width of the uncertainty distribution. It is typically chosen as Fuc = 3.44, yielding a 99.73 % probability that SC2 is located within the radius Ruc according to Eq. 1. Using the\nvalues of Pf ail,av predicted from Eq. 19 and substituting them into Eq. 27, the mean search time for multiple scans Tms is obtained. The latter is plotted against the track-width for various scan speeds from 10 mrad/s to 100 mrad/s, given by the black solid lines in Fig. 6. The results of Monte Carlo simulations (blue and red triangles) are found to be in very good agreement to the analytical predictions. From these curves it is easy to determine the minimum search time Tms,min and the associated track-width Dt.min which optimize the acquisition architecture for a given scan speed. These parameters are found to change from Tms,min = 1.13 s, Dt,min = 58 \u00b5rad (overlap of 0.55 Rd) for \u03b3 = 10 mrad/s to Tms,min = 0.08 s, Dt,min = 70 \u00b5rad (overlap of 0.25 Rd) for \u03b3 = 100 mrad/s. This indicates that the optimal beam overlap OV decreases with increasing scan speed to smaller and smaller values, owing to the emergence of correlations that mitigate the impact of beam jitter."

            "text": "In this paper a comprehensive overview is given of important aspects to be considered in the development of a probabilistic model for the spatial acquisition of optical links. An analytical model for the probability of acquisition failure (Pf ail) under the influence of beam jitter is derived, where jitter correlation effects that depend on the spectral shape S( f ), the scan speed \u03b3, and the width of the uncertainty distribution \u03c3uc are considered. Correlations of the jitter amplitude between two successive tracks of the search spiral can greatly reduce Pf ail . They emerge if the width of the jitter auto-correlation function is larger than the mean spiral revolution time \u03c40 > Tmean[14], i.e. if the jitter bandwidth is sufficiently small (increasing \u03c40) and the scan speed sufficiently fast (decreasing Tmean), which is a parameter regime accessible to typical optical communication missions in space. In the derivation the jitter fluctuations were decomposed into correlated (parallel) and uncorrelated (normal) components,\nwhose amplitudes could be obtained from the normalized jitter auto-correlation function evaluated for the spiral revolution time. This allowed obtaining closed-form analytical solutions. In the limit of fully correlated jitter Pf ail was found to approach 0, and in the limit of uncorrelated jitter the previous result of a simpler model [16] was obtained. Linearizing the analytical model with respect to the correlation amplitude enabled Pf ail to be expressed in terms of basic transcendental functions. Very good agreement was found between the predictions of the analytical model and the results of Monte Carlo simulations, which verified the validity of the analytical model in the narrower sense and the conceptual understanding of correlation effects in the broader sense. Model predictions confirmed that increasing the scan speed leads to a decrease of Pf ail from the limit of uncorrelated jitter towards ever smaller values, as expected. For correlated jitter a similar dependency of Pf ail on the track-width Dt was found as observed for uncorrelated jitter, albeit with a shift towards lower probabilities depending on the correlation strength. It was shown that correlation parameters only enter the probability of failure through a compound scaling parameter \u03b7 = \u03b3/(\u03c3uc fr) and the correlation efficiency factor Fe f f was introduced which defines the performance increase relative to the uncorrelated jitter limit. Finally, the analytical model allowed calculating the mean search time for repetitive scans and determining the minimum time associated with the optimal choice of track-width for a given scan speed. In conclusion, the analytical model presented in this paper accounts for jitter correlation effects, while previous analytical models and most simulations only consider the total jitter power, which may lead to large errors in the predicted probability of acquisition failure for certain mission configurations. Therefore, this model may help improve and optimize the acquisition architecture in performance critical applications, in particular those employing a fast scanning terminal accommodated on a platform defined by a low-bandwidth jitter spectrum.\nAcknowledgments.
