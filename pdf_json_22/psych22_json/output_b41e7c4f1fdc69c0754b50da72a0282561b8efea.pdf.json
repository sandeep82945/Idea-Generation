Concomitantly, there has been increased research interest in the value of arts-based strategies for enhancing wellbeing amongst adults living with some form of dementia. Many subtypes of dementia have been defined, each with a different pathway or process (Stephan and Brayne, 2010), but in general terms dementia is characterised by progressive decline in cognition of sufficient severity to interfere with activities of daily living (Knopman et\u00a0al., 2001). In their review Beard (2011) differentiate between two distinct orientations underpinning participative arts interventions: art as therapy, and art as activity. The former has a biomedical focus, emphasising clinical outcomes, such as the reduction of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, whereas the latter prioritises person-centred\nTYPE Brief Research Report PUBLISHED 27 September 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.965122"

The emerging consensus is that interventions using music, dance, drama, visual arts, and poetry provide positive outcomes for people with dementia (Selberg, 2015). Concretely, they have been found to improve subjective wellbeing (Johnson et\u00a0al., 2015), learning (Bannan and Montgomery-Smith, 2008), the opportunity to exercise autonomous choice (Melhuish et\u00a0 al., 2017), and enhanced quality of life (Hannemann, 2006).\nThese findings, however, remain tentative. In a critical review of participative arts interventions, Zeilig et\u00a0 al. (2014) emphasise that adequately evaluating complex interventions such as participative arts projects is difficult as they involve interrelated variables, confounding factors, and a range of possible outcomes. Specifically, as regards poetry interventions, they conclude that \u201cdespite the anecdotal evidence that many projects use poetry and creative writing with people living with dementia, studies evaluating the efficacy of these interventions (especially from the point of view of the PWD) are scant and work examining the applications of poetry using rigorous, robust methodologies is rather sparse.\u201d (p.\u00a023). When it comes to Shared Reading, however, such rigorous investigations into the impact and effect of reading literature with people with dementia have been undertaken. Billington et\u00a0al. (2013) have studied Shared Reading conducted in care homes, hospital wards and day centre. Using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) to assess staff views of changes in dementia symptom severity for participants in the Shared Reading groups, they found a significant reduction. This effect was predicated not only on enhancement of listening, memory and attention, but also on enjoyment, meaningfulness and renewed sense of personal identity. Furthermore, Longden et\u00a0al. (2016) carried out a RCT on Shared Reading for adults living with dementia. Quality of Life was measured and the study found that compared to the control condition, the positive effects of Shared Reading on QoL were maintained once the activity ended.\nAccording to Dowrick et\u00a0 al., Shared Reading \u201cnot only harnesses the power of reading as a cognitive process, but also acts as a [...] socially coalescing presence, allowing readers a sense of subjective and shared experience.\u201d (Dowrick et\u00a0al., 2012, p.\u00a0 16). It is this power of Shared Reading to create meaningful interaction and a coalescing presence I\u00a0wish to explore in this article. The purpose of this case study of the use of poetry in weekly Shared Reading sessions in a care home in Merseyside is to investigate instances of how participants with mild to moderate dementia collaborate in processes of meaning-making that allow them shared experiences of being moved by poetry. An under-thematised aspect of psychological wellbeing is the capacity for being moved and for sharing such moments. This article addresses the following question: how can the specific multimodality of the text (each reader has the text before them, the poem is read aloud and there may be\u00a0non-verbal props in the form of, e.g., photographs related to motives in the poem) in the Shared Reading model create moments of meeting?"

There is also an action research motivation underlying the study, which \u201caims at changing three things: practitioners\u2019 practices, their understandings of their practices, and the conditions in which they practise\u201d (Kemmis, 2009, p.\u00a0463), and which is thus both practice- based and practice-led (Candy, 2006). This case study is based on weekly sessions of Shared Reading in a care home in Merseyside carried out over a period of 12 weeks. The average number of participants was 7\u20138, ranging from 5 to 12. Some of the participants showed only mild symptoms of dementia, while others had quite severe cognitive impairments. None of the sessions were audio-recorded, so that the empirical material consists of post-session notes made by me as both reader-leader and researcher. The real names of participants have been altered, so that pseudonyms are used throughout, and identifiable information has been excluded. Sessions were conducted in a secluded corner of an open lounge, where we\u00a0would sit in comfortable chairs forming a neat circle.\nAll case studies spring from the need to develop in-depth understanding through empirical research of a contemporary phenomenon, based on a small set of instances and complex conditions set in their real-world contexts (e.g., Bromley, 1986). This case study is both descriptive and explanatory (Zeilig et\u00a0al., 2018) in that it seeks to describe what happens/appears in sessions of Shared Reading, in light of a theoretical framework borrowed from intersubjective psychotherapy. Previous studies of Shared Reading have identified \u201cbreakthrough moments\u201d (Davis et\u00a0al., 2016; Gray et\u00a0al., 2016; Longden et\u00a0al., 2016)\u2013moments in which cognitive and affective turning-points take place that may have lasting benefit for the participant, when\nThe literature seems to get through to participants, and participants seem to experience a change or awakening taking place beneath the level of intention and beyond the general norms of response or opinion. Evidence that something significant had happened, through a change in the perception of reality, was sought through analysis of the transcripts. These moments, themselves specific and emotionally powerful, were often shown to the participants at interview, to test their validity and significance (Davis et\u00a0al., 2016).\nSuch breakthrough moments are understood as intrapsychic events that may be\u00a0 communicated to the group, but can also be\u00a0private events not shared in the group with the reader leader or other members. For an in-depth discussion of such a private breakthrough moment that had long-lasting life-changing effects, (see Tanger\u00e5s, 2020). As such, they are similar to what Stern et\u00a0al.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nterm \u201cnow moments\u201d, characterized by elements of surprise, spontaneity, unpredictability and heightened affect:\nThese moments are pregnant with an unknown future that can feel like an impasse or an opportunity. The present moment becomes very dense subjectively as in a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d\u2026 a \u201cnow\u201d moment is an announcement of a potential emergent property of a complex dynamic system. Although the history of its emergence may be\u00a0untraceable, it is prepared for with fleeting or pale prior apparitions, something like a motif in music that quietly and progressively prepares for its transformation into the major theme. Still the exact instant and form of its appearance remain unpredictable (Stern et\u00a0al., 1998, p.\u00a0912).\nSuch \u201cnow moments\u201d may turn into intersubjective moments of meeting. If it is mutually recognized and grasped, the opportunity becomes \u201clit up\u201d as an affectively rich \u201cmoment of meeting\u201d in which \u201ceach partner has actively contributed something unique or authentic of his or herself as an individual\u201d (p.\u00a0913):\nThe key concept, the \u201cmoment of meeting\u201d, is the emergent property of the \u201cmoving along\u201d process that alters the intersubjective environment, and thus the implicit relational knowing. In brief, moving along is comprised of a string of \u201cpresent moments\u201d, which are the subjective units marking the slight shifts in direction while proceeding forward. At times, a present moment becomes \u201chot\u201d affectively, and full of portent for the therapeutic process. These moments are called \u201cnow moments\u201d. When a now moment is seized, i.e., responded to with an authentic, specific personal response from each partner, it becomes a \u201cmoment of meeting\u201d. This is the emergent property that alters the subjective context (Stern et\u00a0al., 1998, pp.\u00a0909\u2013910).\nThis kind of emergent property can only arise if the moving along occurs within a context that is rule governed by an established technique that is (implicitly) well understood by the interactants. Affective sounds, head nods, eye contact, and other nonverbal communication are often observed in such moments, followed by brief pauses of \u201copen space\u201d where each sits with and takes in what just occurred. Stern gives two concrete examples: looking at someone in the eyes who is looking at you, and taking a deep breath while talking to someone (Stern, 2004, p. xv). According to Stern, moments of meeting constitute \u201cthe key moments of change in psychotherapy\u201d (Stern, 2004, p. xi).\nThe Boston Process of Change Study Group developed the theory based on detailed observations of \u201cimplicit relational knowing\u201d in mother-infant interactions (Stern et\u00a0al., 1998) and the theory has been applied principally to psychotherapy, but increasingly also to other contexts of pedagogy and learning. For instance, Schneider and Keenan find that \u201cthe intersubjective space of the classroom can provide students with experiences of\nbeing known and \u201cmoments of meeting\u201d which can result in transformative learning\u201d (Schneider and Keenan, 2015, p.\u00a0 1). There are four distinct phases: moving along, now moments, moments of meeting and open spaces. These are directly applicable to Shared Reading. Thus we\u00a0 may say that \u201cmoving along\u201d corresponds to the activities of \u201cgetting into\u201d and \u201cstaying with\u201d the poem in Shared Reading\u2013the normal procedures of asking questions in relation to the poem, commenting on it or responding to other members\u2019 comments. This \u201cmoving along\u201d may be\u00a0 punctuated by \u201cnow\u201d moments, akin to \u201cbreakthrough moments\u201d. If these moments are fully met and responded to by either the reader leader or another participant, there may be\u00a0a moment of meeting, which subsequently segues into an \u201copen space\u201d of stillness and change of affect. In the following I\u00a0will, through eight vignettes, explore such moments of meeting."

            "text": "The first moment of meeting occurred at the very end of the initial session. We\u00a0 had been reading and talking about Philip Larkin\u2019s poem Coming. I\u00a0had chosen it on the basis of personal liking as well as having witnessed it being used with success by another reader leader in a different care home. The poem\u2019s theme is resonant for the participants in that it treats of specific childhood memories, and also of implicit affective knowing that may not be\u00a0 verbalizable: \u201c\u2026. And I, whose childhood / Is a forgotten boredom, / Feel like a child /Who comes on a scene / Of adult reconciling, / And can understand nothing / But the unusual laughter, / And starts to be\u00a0 happy\u201d. However, although the discussion was productive and touched upon memories of both spring and childhood, the session may be\u00a0understood to have been marked by a \u201cmoving along\u201d, in that no apparent \u201cnow moments\u201d occurred. It was pleasant and several members contributed actively \u2013 questioning the metaphor of foreheads of houses being bathed. But then at the end something unprecedented happened. It is customary to round off the session by a final reading aloud of the poem, ideally a reading which assimilates and is resplendent with all the various meanings we\u00a0have touched upon during the dialoge. I\u00a0proceeded to end the talk, and said \u201cso, let us read the whole poem one final time.\u201d As I\u00a0started to read the first words, \u201cOn longer evenings\u2026,\u201d the participants joined in, one after the other, building to a chorus as we\u00a0all solemnly but with enjoyment read it aloud together. An entirely surprising, unpredictable and affect-laden experience, and the participants could see that they had greatly surprised me, and several smiles were exchanged. From this moment of meeting, an \u201copen space\u201d was clearly opened up, as we\u00a0just sat in silent tranquil enjoyment for a long while afterwards. How this arose I\u00a0will never know. Perhaps it stemmed from a practice common during their school days, which they simply assumed was what we\u00a0were meant to do. Alternatively, they\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\ntook my words at face value: \u201clet us read it.\u201d What is more important is that this moment created a change of procedure and established a group culture, as on each subsequent occasion we\u00a0 would repeat the chorus at the session\u2019s close. It was an important instance of co-creation (Zeilig et\u00a0 al., 2018), of everybody contributing toward a socially coalescing, implicit relational knowing.\nAcknowledged discovery of performative skills in participant\nThe following week I\u00a0 opted for Christina Rossetti\u2019 sonnet Remember. This may have been a bold choice, as it encourages participants to envisage themselves saying goodbye to a loved one or indeed to life itself. But I\u00a0knew other reader leaders had used it in care homes. Once again the now moment was connected to the reading aloud aspect. This time, however, it was the surprise discovery of the declamatory abilities of one of the participants that really stood out. The standard procedure in Shared Reading is for the reader leader to read the poem aloud once, and then leave a pause, and if no one comments then offer to read it again, inviting the participants to have a go. At first it did not seem as if anyone would accept the invitation, but then I\u00a0happened to glance at Katherine, who until this point had been very quiet and avoided eye contact with other participants. She looked up and met my gaze, but did not say anything. By now she seemed fully alert and present. I\u00a0took a chance and addressed her directly, inviting her to read aloud. Such direct requests can be\u00a0risky, and in general I\u00a0tend to avoid them, but I\u00a0got the sense that she wanted me to ask her. She hesitated for a few seconds, then launched into the most beautiful rendition of the poem, mellifluous, sonorous and rhythmic. Evidently, her reading prompted immediate recognition from the group, as members exclaimed, \u201cah, that was wonderful\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d Katherine seemed both energized and proud afterwards \u2013 a clear now moment. I\u00a0consider it also as a moment of meeting in that her skill was acknowledged by us. We\u00a0would remember this, so that next time, when reading Wordsworth\u2019s Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, participants actively encouraged her to open the session by reading it, and I\u00a0conceded that she would perform it better than I\u00a0could. As such, it marked a rupture from normal procedure where the reader leader starts by reading the poem aloud. It was a moment that altered both of us. It transpired that she had been a teacher by profession, and also engaged in amateur theatre groups in her younger years."

            "heading": "I must go down to the seas again",
            "text": "Many people in Merseyside have a connection to the sea, so I\u00a0thought it would be\u00a0good to include John Masefield\u2019s poem Sea Fever. The poem gives voice to a universal longing and should therefore appeal to the whole group. Our subsequent discussion proved me right in this, as participants reminisced about family\nmembers or days gone by. One of the participants, Henry, told us of his time working in the port, and reflected upon how much society has changed since then. But again, the now moment was related to the act of reading the poem aloud. In another article I\u00a0have thematized the double modality of Shared Reading, the affordances made possible by participants having a copy of the text to read and at the same time being able to listen to the text being read aloud (Skjerdingstad and Tanger\u00e5s, 2019). In Shared Reading in care homes, this may be\u00a0expanded to a multimodality (Jewitt, 2007; Kress, 2010). It can be\u00a0very productive to bring along photos of images related to the poem, for instances pictures of birds (such as a thrush in the case of Larkin\u2019s poem) so that participants more easily and vibrantly can envisage the world of the poem. This time, in leading the discussion, as I\u00a0repeated several of the stanzas of this poem\u2013which is marked by a series of repeated conjunctives (\u201cand,\u201d \u201cand\u201d) and has a very strong rocking rhythm reminiscent of waves\u2013I would use nonverbal gestures to evoke the imagery. Using exaggerated rhythmic hand gestures and gently swaying my upper body from left to right, I\u00a0attempted to embody the motion of the waves and the sounds of the sea. This was apparently successful: one participant, Margareth, seemingly without being aware of it, starting to move along in imitation of my gestures. Afterwards, I\u00a0remarked to her: \u201cyou enjoyed that poem, did not you, Margareth?\u201d and she nodded vigorously. The reason I\u00a0interpret it as a now moment turning into a moment of meeting, is that she was subsequently more active in our discussion of the poem than she had been in previous weeks. She said she could vividly hear \u201cthe cry of the gulls, and the splashing of the waves and the feel of the salty wind on my face,\u201d thus reiterating not just the images but the repetitions of the conjunctive \u201cand.\u201d\nThe reluctant relative and the fear of being upset\nJust as we\u00a0were about to begin a session, we\u00a0were interrupted as the husband of one of the participants, Jill, came to visit her. I\u00a0explained to him about the Shared Reading and that it was open to all, but he\u00a0was very skeptical and expressed concern lest his wife get \u201cupset\u201d by the poem. Instead of contradicting him, I\u00a0simply invited him to take part so that he\u00a0could look after her in case she did get upset. However, as he\u00a0could see that Jill was contentedly listening to the reading, and also chipping in with some comments during the discussion of the poem (Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet XXX), he\u00a0started to relax. Jill seemed very pleased and proud to show him what she was part of, and in the way he\u00a0looked at her afterwards, I\u00a0could sense that he\u00a0acknowledged this, and that there was a moment of meeting between the two of them. They took a copy of the poem away with them, as he\u00a0wheeled her back to her room afterwards. It made me reflect on the word \u201cupset.\u201d Although it has a negative valour and is connected to unwanted feelings, it is closely connected to \u201cnow moments\u201d, in that it represents a rupture which opens up the possibility of repair, if met with empathy.\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "A now moment may come as a rupture of an interaction pattern or a set way of doing things. One of the regular group members, Elsie, would, as soon as we\u00a0had finished reading a poem aloud, invariably exclaim, regardless of the poems content or tone: \u201caw, that\u2019s nice.\u201d This habitual response was probably a collaborative effort, to show her appreciation. But she seemingly could never follow up on that remark by entering into exploration of the words on the page. The first time she said it, I\u00a0simply nodded in acknowledgment and smiled, hoping for more. The second time I\u00a0asked whether there was something particular that she liked about the poem. Perhaps that was too challenging, because she became flustered and bewildered, as if she had been rebuked. On other occasions, someone else would start talking afterwards. On this particular occasion, however, something happened. The poem in question is a rather difficult poem by Emily Bront\u00eb, \u201cOften rebuked, yet always back returning\u201d. (Curiously, the opening two lines seemed to address this particular sensation: \u201cOften rebuked, yet always back returning / To those first feelings that were born with me.\u201d) After Katherine had read the poem for us, there was a pause, and Elsie made to say something. I\u00a0 expected the usual comment, but this time she instead proceeded to read aloud the penultimate stanza of the poem:\nI\u2019ll walk where my own nature would be\u00a0leading: It vexes me to choose another guide: Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding; Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side.\nIt was very evident that this had made an impact on her, as she was straining to articulate something. \u201cMy parents and I, I\u00a0remember\u2026 Us going hillwalking. Going to the mountains. It was windy, the nature, lovely.\u201d She wanted to say more, but stopped. It was clear that it was the concrete stanza that had elicited a specific episodic memory. Although not very detailed, the memory evidently had a specific feel to it, as her tears welled up and she looked up into the distance as if she could see the mountain top. So I\u00a0 repeated the last line of the stanza whilst getting eye contact, and she nodded as if I\u00a0had understood. The importance of increased specificity of memories has been demonstrated by Serrano et\u00a0al. (2004); using Autobiographical Retrieval Practice, they found that older adults showed decrease in hopelessness and increased life satisfaction when enabled to retrieve specific memories from childhood."

One participant suggested it might be\u00a0a letter from a soldier to his girlfriend back\nhome. Another member picked up on this idea, raising the question whether it could have been a Dear John letter. Then Henry divulged a very significant biographical memory: he\u00a0had been a soldier, and had been very much in love, \u201cbut when I\u00a0got back home she was seeing someone else.\u201d And then he\u00a0told us he\u00a0had never got over it and had never married. The participant sat next to him reached out to him and said \u201cthat is really sad,\u201d while gently touching his shoulder. And then someone else spontaneously read out loud the third stanza:\nBid that heart stay, and it will stay, To honour thy decree; Or bid it languish quite away, And \u2018t shall do so for thee.\nHis recollection sprung out of the poem, and his disclosure elicited genuine empathy from several other participants. Furthermore, staff told him afterwards that they did not know this about his life, and felt that they had got to know him better. I\u00a0consider this an instance of a moment of meeting between poem and participant, between participants, and between participant and staff. The suggestion that the poem was about a soldier writing home was not an obvious one to me. It made me speculate about the following: During our previous session, on Remembrance Day, we\u00a0had read MCMXIV by Larkin, which famously ends:\nNever such innocence, Never before or since, As changed itself to past. Without a word \u2013 the men Leaving the gardens tidy, The thousands of marriages, Lasting a little while longer: Never such innocence again.\nCould it be\u00a0that the memory of this poem was carried over into the reading of the Herrick poem, that the context for Larkin\u2019s poem resonated with Herrick\u2019s love poem? As if there had been a moment of meeting between the two poems themselves."

Henry, having pondered the meaning of the last stanza, then seemed able to relate to their comments, offering the suggestion that the person wanted to get away from his past, and that sometimes the dream is a means of escape. After musing for a few seconds, he\u00a0 thought perhaps it could be\u00a0somebody who has lost what he\u00a0has. I\u00a0think that is quite a profound reading. In this poem\u2019s repetition of \u201cI will arise and go\u201d there is a clear allusion to the (King James) Bible, to the parable of the Prodigal Son who indeed loses all he\u00a0has and goes back home.

She did not look as if she would be\u00a0able to join in the Shared Reading, as she was unable to raise her head, and when I\u00a0went up to talk to her, a member of staff said that she was too ill to take part. However, when I\u00a0asked her whether she might like to listen to a poetry reading, she responded affirmatively. Maeve was duly placed within the circle of participants, but was unable to hold the sheet of paper containing the poem Rainbow Children by Seamus Heaney. Kindly, Pat, the participant next to her, assisted her by holding it up for her to see. Frankly, I\u00a0expected little from Maeve by way of active participation. But in this I\u00a0was wrong. We\u00a0read and discussed the poem. We\u00a0spent some time trying to figure out the details of the setting, how the children could be\u00a0 eye-level with the white cups.

In a barely audible voice she related how God had talked to her while she was walking to school one morning when she was \u201conly little.\u201d And that she had told no one about this, not daring to tell even her mum. This was brought about by the religious imagery of the poem\u2019s ending, where the raindrops are \u201cfull with the light of the sky\u201d and the children \u201ccould stream through the eye of a needle.\u201d In terms of \u201copen spaces\u201d, I\u00a0think the sharing of this remarkable biographical incident opened up the poem for us all."

Extrapolating from a psychotherapy context, we\u00a0may say that insofar as the now moment is sustained and shared between two or more subjectivities\u2013reader leader and participant, between participants or relatives/members of staff\u2013as long as the other is able to grasp the moment and explore it, the possibility of a moment of meeting emerges. In a qualitative study of a variety of therapists from different orientations, Duarte et\u00a0 al., 2022 found that.\nMoments of meeting were described by all therapists as co-constructed moments that take place during the process through therapist-patient interaction. These moments are spontaneous and lived as a genuine and unplanned experience. They are creative, unique and singular experiences that produce feelings of emotional synchrony that can take different forms and levels of intensity. (p.\u00a0516).\nFurthermore, all therapists interviewed agreed that these moments have a very powerful effects for the therapy process and that they \u201calso have a long-term effect that expresses later during the process. (p.\u00a0517),\u201d thus contributing to long term changes. Did the moments of meeting I\u00a0have described lead to lasting change? I\u00a0have no way of knowing, but they may have effected change in the short term. One thing is for certain, though: They have had a lasting impact on me and constitute some of the strongest experiences I\u00a0have had as a reader leader. Duarte et\u00a0al. suggest that.\nAnother interesting area for further research is the effect that MoM may have on the therapists and if it is possible to understand them as therapeutic for the therapist as well as the patient. We\u00a0hypothesize that through these reminiscences and experiences we\u00a0can also see a profound psychological effect on the therapist that may influence and reinforce their work and their role. (p.\u00a0522).\nI think this is a topic that would be\u00a0interesting to explore in the context of participative arts and bibliotherapy: how is the practitioner changed by her practice?"
