    "abstractText": "Several public events have drawn renewed attention to the connectedness of the international stock market since the fnancial crisis of 2008. We investigate systemic and regional connectedness among stock markets around the world at major public events by constructing correlation networks for 46 markets based on the dynamic time-warping method. We fnd that (i) geographic regionalization is typically observed in the stockmarket network, in which France is dominant, (ii) Europe has the greatest and the Middle East and Africa the least within-region connectedness, (iii) the correlation network structure is highly integrated and compact at major public events, and global events infuence the international stock market more signifcantly than regional events do, and (iv) the importance of China reaches its peak during the era of Sino-US trade friction, showing that public events have enormous impacts on the countries involved.",

We investigate systemic and regional connectedness among stock markets around the world at major public events by constructing correlation networks for 46 markets based on the dynamic time-warping method. We fnd that (i) geographic regionalization is typically observed in the stockmarket network, in which France is dominant, (ii) Europe has the greatest and the Middle East and Africa the least within-region connectedness, (iii) the correlation network structure is highly integrated and compact at major public events, and global events infuence the international stock market more signifcantly than regional events do, and (iv) the importance of China reaches its peak during the era of Sino-US trade friction, showing that public events have enormous impacts on the countries involved."

            "text": "1.1. Background. Economic integration is a matter of great international concern. Connectedness among fnancial markets around the world is increasing. Tis deserves close attention due to the \u201ctoo connected to fail\u201d risk. Moreover, public events can exacerbate the spread of risk, resulting in fnancial crises and persistent impacts on national economies. Direct and indirect connectedness among fnancial markets is accelerating andmaking them increasingly closely related and interdependent, forming a complex fnancial network [1\u20133]. Tis connectedness is both diversifying fnancial risks and promoting their spread [4, 5]. Major public events have led to signifcant changes in the global fnancial system. Terefore, we focus on the correlation network of the international stock market at major public events.\nRecently, the uncertainty of the COVID-19 epidemic has had a negative impact on the global economy. Panic-induced asset sales occurred in the highly leveraged fnancial market in March 2020. Te price of crude oil fell sharply, and the\nratings of US shale oil companies were downgraded. In the international stock market, three major US stock indices triggered the frst-level circuit breaker mechanism. Over 10 days, the market experienced four circuit breakers and then plummeted in mid-June 2020, which led stock indices around the world to plunge.\nFrequent stock market turbulence greatly afects the global economy and fnancial system. Te connectedness among stock markets and the cross-market contagion efect of fnancial risks at major public events attract much attention from academia and industry. Te related research can provide theoretical insights useful for strengthening the connectedness among stock markets, reducing fnancial risk, and improving investment decisions.\n1.2. Literature Review. Te international stock market plays an important role in the fnancial system. One strand of the literature on the connectedness within the international stock market focuses on the transmission between two\nHindawi Complexity Volume 2023, Article ID 3172181, 17 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/3172181\nimportant countries [6\u201310], the connectivity among countries participating in international organizations such as the G7 [11\u201313], and the dependence between the stock market and other markets, such as exchange markets [14, 15], the crude oil market [16\u201318], markets for other commodities [19\u201321], and cryptocurrencies [22\u201324]. Prior works adopt the GARCH family model, the VAR model, and the Copula model to analyze the time-varying correlations between fnancial markets, and they emphasize the efects of policy factors (e.g., changes in monetary policy or regime) and national economy factors (e.g., fnancial and trade linkages) on connectedness among stock markets.\nAnother strand of the literature performs network analyses of the connectedness among stock markets. Network theory, a powerful tool for investigating fnancial markets, abstracts the fnancial system into a network with a set of nodes and edges [25]. Tis method can be used to analyze stock markets comprehensively and reveal the complexity of the system. Te minimum spanning tree (MST), planar maximally fltered graph (PMFG), and correlation threshold method (CTM) are commonly used to construct correlation networks. Mantegna [26] frst proposed the MST as a way to analyze the similarities among stock prices in the S&P 500 Index, fnding signifcant implications for portfolio optimization. Since then, the network-basedmethod has been widely adopted to examine connectedness among fnancial markets. Onnela et al. [27] select 116 stocks in the S&P 500 Index and build a dynamic asset tree based on a correlation matrix of stock price fuctuations, fnding that changes in tree length over time are related to investment diversifcation. Lee et al. [28] present a correlation network of South Korea\u2019s stock returns based on the MST method and confrm that the volatility of stock returns is positively correlated with the density of the stock market network. Jung et al. [29], Garas and Argyrakis [30], Tabak et al. [31], and Cheong et al. [32] set up a complex network of stock markets in South Korea, Greece, Brazil, Japan, and China, respectively, based on the MST method and investigated its topological structure.\nTe PMFG was frst proposed by Tumminello et al. [33], as part of the continuous advances in complex network theory and is widely employed in various felds. Tumminello et al. [33] utilize the PMFG to establish a network comprising 300 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and examine the main topological indicators, such as average path length, node betweenness, and degree. Aste et al. [34] create a network comprising 395 US stocks from 1996 to 2009 based on the PMFG method and fnd that the 2007 US subprime crisis changed the network\u2019s structure and that fnancial sector stocks were no longer its central nodes.\nTe CTM is used to explore fnancial market connections and risk contagion by screening nodes and edges of the original network based on a threshold set to meet the researchers\u2019 information retention requirements. Boginski et al. [35] investigate the statistical characteristics of the stock network based on the CTM and conclude that the degree distribution has power-law properties. Huang et al. [36] discover that the network of the Chinese stock market is robust but vulnerable to intentional attacks. Xi and An [37] construct a stock correlation network based on fnancial\nindicators to detect the cluster characteristics of the community network; they prove that the independence of the community gradually increases as the threshold rises.\nTus, in contrast to the PMFG and CTM, the MST can flter out a large amount of redundant information and reduce interference. Several scholars point out that the MST method can intuitively and comprehensively identify the transmission mechanism of fnancial market risk [38]. Terefore, we use the MSTmodel to construct a correlation network with which to study the connectedness of the international stock market and the evolution of the network structure at major public events.\nTe impact of major public events on the connectedness of the international stock market has caught the attention of scholars because such events trigger frequent turbulence in the fnancial system. For example, Yang et al. [39] build a jump volatility spillover network of Chinese fnancial institutions using the VAR model and fnd that network density reaches a peak during China\u2019s stock market disaster of 2015. Huang et al. [40] detect the time-varying comovement among individual stocks in both normal and crisis periods based on a directed weighted stock network and a weighted LeaderRank algorithm; their results demonstrate that network density, the average clustering coefcient, and global efciency can provide an \u201cearly warning\u201d of potential future crises. He et al. [41] use a volatility spillover network to detect the correlation structure of stock markets at past crisis events; they confrm that the network shows a clustering efect when the stock market is impacted by major public events. Cheng et al. [42] investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic has afected the connectedness network of stock market volatility in 19 economies around the world using the Diebold-Yilmaz volatility network model, fnding that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic strengthened the overall volatility connectedness and that the global connectedness level remained high throughout 2020.\nNevertheless, research studies on the connectedness of fnancial markets at major public events have several limitations: (i) First, the connectedness between two stock markets is usually calculated through the Pearson correlation function. Te Pearson correlation coefcient (PCC) can only measure the linear connectedness between time sequences; this is a problem because the connectedness between fnancial markets is nonlinear, complex, and dynamic. Moreover, the PCC does not work well for strongly correlated and nonrandom time series [43], and it is not robust and can be misleading if outliers exist [44] because realworld data are high-level heterogeneous [30, 45]. (ii) Moreover, constructing a connectedness measure requires that the calculated time series maintain the same record length and data synchronization. Obtaining uninterrupted and complete data in stock markets is difcult due to the inconsistencies in trading hours and holidays, which lead to variations in record lengths. To solve this problem, traditional data processing methods have been used to fll and delete data, leading to deviations via data repair. (iii) Additionally, the topology properties of complex fnancial networks are usually analyzed from a static perspective, such as by selecting specifc time points of public events, which ignores the continuity of fnancial crises and omits\ninformation on the evolution of the network. (iv) Finally, although scholars are increasingly interested in system-level analyses of complex fnancial networks, few market-level analyses of systemically important markets have been attempted.\nMeasures of connectedness among network nodes aim to describe and characterize the correlation between two samples or patterns. Among them, dynamic programming (DP) has good robustness [46, 47]. Te DTW model is the most representative DP similarity measure, and it can deal with local displacement in the sequence efectively. Tis model has three signifcant advantages. First, it can be used to explore the connectedness among return time series with either equal length or unequal length in the international stock market and is thus suitable for the retractable banner. Second, it has superior robustness to the amplitude change, migration, and noise of time series. Tird, it is malleable, in contrast to the traditional Euclidean distance. In addition, it is insensitive to abnormal data and truly reproduces the evolution of the international stock market network at major public events. Tus, we utilize the DTW model to examine connectedness in the international stock market. We focus on major public events that have occurred in recent years in order to help authorities formulate regulatory policies and assist investors in predicting future risk changes and formulating related strategies.\n1.3.MainContributions. Our study on the connectedness of the international stock market at major public events has the following contributions.\n(i) First, we combine the DTW model with the MST method to remedy the limitations of existing measures.\n(ii) Second, we consider diferent tree lengths, which shed new light on the analysis of systematically important stock markets. We identify the sensitivity of global markets to public event shocks and confrm that the importance of stock markets changes over time.\n(iii) Given the complexity of the international stock market network, we study its topology through\ntime-varying analysis. Furthermore, we identify and observe systemically important stock markets based on infuence strength.\n(iv) We statically and dynamically explore the connectedness of the international stock market at the system, region, and market levels. We consider global efciency by investigating the systemic connectivity of the network, and we examine the crossregion, within-region, and total connectedness of several geographical regions in order to assess the systematically important stock markets.\n1.4. Article Organization. Te rest of this article proceeds as follows: In the next section, we explain the DTWmodel and the evaluation criteria used for network connectedness. In Section 3, we describe our data and perform a preliminary analysis. In Section 4, we evaluate connectedness on three levels (i.e., system, region, and market). Finally, we conclude the article in Section 5."

            "text": "2.1. Dynamic Time Warping. We use the dynamic time warping (DTW) model to study a return time series with equal and unequal lengths in the international stock market while dealing with the local displacement, which overcomes the synchronous constraint of the PCC [48]. Tis model is widely employed in speech recognition and other pattern recognition tasks, such as sign language recognition, gesture recognition, online signature matching, data mining, time series clustering, handwriting, and computer vision. However, few scholars have applied it to fnance research [49\u201351].\nAfter constructing a distance matrix, we utilize dynamic programming to seek the optimal curved path with the smallest cumulative distance to measure the connectedness among stock markets. Supposing that two stock indices\u2019 normalized log-returns, Ri and Rj, have the lengths ofM and N, respectively, where Ri \ufffd {Ri (1), Ri (2), . . ., Ri (m), . . ., Ri (M)} and Rj \ufffd {Rj (1), Rj (2), . . ., Rj (n), . . ., Rj (N)}, we defne the local cost matrix Cij for the alignment of two sequences Ri and Rj as follows:\nCij \ufffd\nd Ri(1), Rj(1)  d Ri(1), Rj(2)  \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d Ri(1), Rj(N) \nd Ri(2), Rj(1)  d Ri(2), Rj(2)  \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d Ri(2), Rj(N) \n\u22ee \u22ee \u22f1 \u22ee\nd Ri(M), Rj(1)  d Ri(M), Rj(2)  \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d Ri(M), Rj(N) \n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 , (1)\nwhere the (mth, nth) element of the matrix denotes the square distance d (Ri (m), Rj (n)) between the two points Ri (m) and Rj (n); thus, d(Ri(m), Rj(n) \ufffd (Ri(m) \u2212 Rj(n)2.\nTe warping path is a sequence p \ufffd {p1, p2, . . ., pk, . . ., pk+1} that satisfes the following criteria [52]:\n(i) Boundedness: max (M, N)\u2264K\u2264M + N + 1 (ii) Boundary condition: p1 \ufffd (1, 1) and pk \ufffd (M, N);\nthey are used to indicate the start and end of a curved path\n(iii) Monotonicity condition: m \u2212 m\u2019\u2265 0 and n \u2212 n\u2019\u2265 0\n(iv) Continuity: assuming that two adjacent elements pk+1 \ufffd (m, n) and pk \ufffd (m\u2019, n\u2019) are on a curved path, there must be m \u2212 m\u2019\u2264 1 and n \u2212 n\u2019\u2264 1; that is, the adjacent elements in the warping path are also adjacent in a local cost matrix\nTe total cost cpij of a warping path p between Ri and Rj with respect to the local cost matrix Cij (all pairwise distances) is defned as follows [52]:\nc p ij \ufffd \nK\nk\ufffd1 Cij mk, nk( , (2)\nwhereCij (mk, nk) is the element of themkth row and the nkth column of the local cost matrix Cij.\nTere are exponentially warping paths that meet the aforementioned conditions, and the connectedness measure Dij between Ri and Rj is the length of optimal warping path p\u2217 that minimizes the warping cost. It is defned as follows:\nDij \ufffd 1 K c p\u2217 ij , (3)\nsuch that p\u2217 \ufffd p\u22171 , p\u22172 , ..., p\u2217k , ..., p \u2217 K  \ufffd argmin(c p ij, p \u2208 PM\u00d7N), where PM\u00d7N is the set of all possible warping paths, and K in the denominator is employed to address the disadvantage that warping paths may have diferent lengths. If two stock indices, i and j, are entirely similar, then Dij \ufffd 0; if the two stock indices are completely dissimilar, then Dij \ufffd 1. Consequently, 0\u2264Dij\u2264 1.\nWe obtain the similarity matrix (i.e., connectedness matrix) by calculating the connectedness Dij between any two stock markets. Ten, the adjacency matrix can be counted based on the similarity matrix.\nFinally, the adjacency matrix is converted into the international stock market network by the MST method. Following graph theory, we construct the MST that is a tree structure, by connecting N nodes with N \u2212 1 edges. Each stock market corresponds to a node, and the connectedness between two stock markets corresponds to an edge in the network. It is required that the sum of the weights of all edges in the tree be the smallest and that the edges do not form a loop. Tus, MST is utilized to select N \u2212 1 edges with the strongest connectedness (i.e., the smallest distance) for each stock market to form a network. Terefore, MST has superior robustness and is the preferred network analysis tool for many scholars.\n2.2. Evaluation Criteria for Network Connectedness. We employ specifc evaluation criteria for network connectedness to examine the topology of the international stock market.\nWe frst introduce normalized tree length (NTL). Based on theN\u00d7N similarity matrixD, the NTLmeasure is used to explore the properties of the MST of the international stock market, which is defned as follows [27, 43]:\nNTL \ufffd 1\nN \u2212 1  Dij\u2208\u0398 Dij. (4)\nSimilarly, we explore connectedness and information exchange efciency in the international stock market network using global efciency (GE), which comprehensively considers the connection efciency of node pairs. Te GE measure is generally defned as follows:\nGE \ufffd 1\nN(N \u2212 1) \nN\ni\u2260j&i,j\ufffd1\n1 d(i, j) , (5)\nwhere d (i, j) denotes the shortest path length from node i to j and d (i, j)\ufffd+\u221e if there is no path from i to j in the network.\nRegional and sectoral aggregation is widely investigated in [9, 53\u201358]. Following the region-level connectivity measure proposed by Wang et al. [59], we apply regional distance (RD) and regional connectedness (RC) from one region m to another region n (including itself ), which are defned as follows:\nRDm\u21d4n \ufffd 1\nNmNn \nNn i\ufffd1  Nm j\ufffd1 Dij, (6)\nRCm\u21d4n \ufffd 1 \u2212 RDm\u21d4n, (7)\nwhereNm andNn are the number of stock markets in regions m and n, respectively. When m\ufffd n, Nn \ufffdNm \u2212 1, and i\u2260 j.\nIn equation (6), we standardize the distance between two regions by utilizing their respective numbers of stock markets to eliminate the sample size bias because four regions have diferent numbers in our sample.\nIn the network, letting \u0393i be the set of nodes connected to node (i.e., stock market index) i, we defne the infuence strength (IS) of node i as follows:\nISi \ufffd  j\u2208\u0393i \u03c1ij, (8)\nwhere \u03c1ij is the correlation coefcient between node i and j, and the conversion formula between \u03c1ij and Dij is as follows:\n\u03c1ij \ufffd 1 \u2212 D 2 ij. (9)\nIf two stock indices, i and j, are entirely similar, then \u03c1ij \ufffd 1; if the two stock indices are completely dissimilar, then \u03c1ij \ufffd 0. Consequently, 0\u2264 \u03c1ij\u2264 1.\nTerefore, the value of IS depends on two factors: the number of edges connecting the node and the value of the correlation coefcient."

            "text": "3.1. Sample Selection. We select the daily closing prices of 46 important stock market indices from January 23, 2003, to July 16, 2021, provided by the Wind database. Our sample comprehensively refects quotations on the international stock market. Complete data for all 50 stock markets is not available. Hence, the sample includes 46 of the top 50 markets ranked by their average daily trading volumes, which are geographically widespread and account for 90% of international stock market capitalization.\nTese 46 important stock markets are in four regions: Europe, the Middle East and Africa, America, and the AsiaPacifc region. Te location and descriptive statistics of each stock market are shown in tables 1 and 2 (in the Appendix). Te average returns of the stock markets were all positive during the sample period, implying that they ofer generally good investment value. Additionally, the skewness and kurtosis values show that the return series of the stock markets have a sharp peak and thick tail, refecting a nonnormality of the unconditional distribution of the return time series.\n3.2. Data Description. Figure 1 shows the average annual return and the average daily return of the stock market indices from 2003 to 2021. We fnd that the average annual return changes greatly at public events and drops signifcantly during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis (with the lowest value being \u22120.29%), the 2010-2011 European sovereign debt crisis, the 2013\u20132015 Fed rate hike and international crude oil plunge, the 2018\u20132021 period of SinoUS trade friction, and the COVID-19 pandemic. A rebound occurs during a time of fnancial stability.\nTere is a close correlation between the average daily return fuctuation and the major public events. Te fuctuations, ranging from large to small, correspond to the following events: the US subprime crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed rate hike, the Chinese A-share \u201cstock disaster,\u201d and the European debt crisis.\nFigure 1 also shows that the sample period is split into fve periods according to the major public events. In each period, the average annual return declines and rises along with the beginning and ending of the events, and the fuctuations in the average daily return grow from small to large and then decline back to small.\n3.3. Subdivision Basis of Sample Period. We examine the impact of public events on the international stock market by dividing the sample period into fve subperiods, as described below.\n(i) In the frst half of 2003, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and the relevant fnancial departments issued a series of policies and regulations on foreign exchange management and overseas investment to adapt to the requirements of the World Trade Organization. As an emerging market economy, China began to integrate into the world fnancial system.We denote the period before the US subprime crisis (January 2003\u2013June 2007) as Period I.\n(ii) Several scholars consider that the US subprime crisis started in June 2007 and ended in June 2009 [43]. We thus denote the period from June 2007 to June 2009 (during the US subprime crisis) as Period II.\n(iii) After that crisis, the international fnancial market entered a recovery phase, and the European debt crisis began, starting in Greece. Larger countries\non the fnancial system, such as the hike in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate, plummeting crude oil prices, and Brexit. We denote this period of economic recession (December 2013\u2013March 2018) as Period IV.\n(v) In March 2018, US President Trump decided to impose punitive tarifs on products imported from China. China responded immediately and announced additional tarifs on $3 billion worth of US goods. Te efects of the trade war quickly spread throughout the world. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world and was a huge\nshock to the international stock market. We denote the period of Sino-US trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2018\u2013July 2021) as Period V."

Figure 2 displays the international stock market network of Period I. France from Europe, Indonesia from Asia-Pacifc, and Canada from America are the central nodes of their respective clusters. Asia-Pacifc and America are divided into several groups.\nWe fnd that strong economies in the Asia-Pacifc region are separate from their geographic cluster. For example, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, located in the European cluster, are all Asia-Pacifc countries. Tis result occurs for two reasons. (i) First, Japan and South Korea are economically developed countries with complete fnancial systems; indeed, Japan is called \u201cApacExJap\u201d (i.e., \u201cAsiaPacifc region except for Japan\u201d). (ii) Second, the economic growth of Singapore, Japan, and South Korea has been deeply infuenced by Western countries, and their fnancial systems are relatively independent of those of other AsiaPacifc countries.\nMeanwhile, breaking away from the America cluster, Brazil enters the edge of the European cluster and becomes a node closely connected with China and Russia. Tis can be explained as follows: (i) as a BRICS country, Brazil is closely connected to China and Russia, also BRICS members. Tus, their economies are highly complementary, and they engage in close cooperation on energy, trade, agriculture, and food security. (ii) the Brazilian fnancial market is also highly\ninternationalized. Taking average daily trading volume as the statistical parameter, foreign investors account for more than 40% of Brazil\u2019s stock market and derivatives market, and most are from the United States and Europe. Te proportion of foreign investor shareholding is higher in the Brazilian stock market than in most other American countries. Furthermore, the Brazilian stock market ofers a platform for international product trading. For example, the Brazilian Exchange and the US CME jointly issue crosslinked products.\n4.1.2. Construction of the Network during the US Subprime Crisis. Te network of Period II difers considerably from that of Period I, as shown in Figure 3. Te number of central nodes decreases, and the links in the network become closer. As a result, the network consisting of several clusters can even be regarded as a large, unifed cluster. Te geographical aggregation efect is more obvious: (i) Te Asia-Pacifc cluster was concentrated during the US subprime crisis, and its central node is Singapore. (ii) Te central node of the European cluster is still France. China is the only country\nthat is separated from the Asia-Pacifc cluster, and it is directly linked to the European cluster via Ireland and Sweden. Another interesting fnding is that China is closer to the center node than it was in Period I, and the Chinese position starts rising in the network.\nFigures 2 and 3 show that Singapore is an important node in the Asia-Pacifc cluster. As a fnancial center, Singapore became more prominent during the US subprime crisis. Tis may happen because its government promotes the development of Singapore as a \u201cfnancial nation\u201d and seeks to strengthen Singapore\u2019s position as an ofshore US dollar center and preferred asset management center in Asia. Singapore also has a strong banking system and world-class port logistics. Facing the impact of the Asian fnancial crisis and US subprime crisis, the Singaporean fnancial market\ntook efective action under the leadership of its government and continued its development as an international fnancial center. During the US subprime crisis, Singapore was the only Asian country that was rated AAA by the three major credit rating agencies (i.e., Fitch International, Standard and Poor\u2019s, and Moody\u2019s).\n4.1.3. Construction of the Network during Crisis Recovery and the European Debt Crisis Period. Figure 4 shows the international stock market network in Period III. On the one hand, the closeness of the network is greatly reduced. Te European and Asia-Pacifc clusters are still centralized. France and the United States become central nodes of the network. Venezuela, Argentina, Lebanon, and other\ncountries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa are on the margins.\nBy contrast, China is reincorporated into the Asia-Pacifc cluster and is connected to the European cluster through the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia, which all have relatively close fnancial and trade links to China. Te AsiaPacifc cluster is still clustered with Singapore as the central node. Simultaneously, the American cluster is divided into two parts: one is composed of developed countries in North America, which are closely linked to the European cluster via the United States; the other is comprised mainly of Latin American countries, on the margins of the network.\n4.1.4. Construction of the Network during the Global Economic Recession. Figure 5 shows the international stock market network during the global economic recession. From a macro perspective, the network structure is closer than it was in Period III due to the hike in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate, the plunge in international crude oil, and China\u2019s A-share stock disaster. Aside from France, the Netherlands, Finland, and Belgium become central nodes of the network. Te American cluster contains two parts: developed countries in North America and underdeveloped countries in Latin America. Moreover, the Asia-Pacifc cluster no longer exists and is divided into several parts. China is linked to France via Germany. China\u2019s infuence on the international stock market increases signifcantly due to the progress of the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative.\n4.1.5. Construction of the Network during the Sino-US Trade Friction and COVID-19 Pandemic Period. Figure 6 shows the MST during the time of Sino-US trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic. Te geographical aggregation greatly diminishes. Except for the European and Asia-Pacifc clusters, which are still centralized, the other clusters no longer exist. Korea is connected to China, Japan, Singapore,\nand Vietnam, which highlights its important position. India and Australia are separated from the original Asia-Pacifc cluster and are connected to the United States and Canada in the America cluster. Note that the United States and Canada are connected to the European cluster, while most other American countries are on the margins of the network.\n4.1.6. General Features of Network. Te international stock market network has noteworthy features in all periods.\n(i) Te stock markets are closely linked and move towards geographical aggregation in the following way: frst, European markets exhibit the most obvious aggregation, and the European cluster occupies the core position of the network in all periods. Second, the American and Asia-Pacifc clusters are located around the European cluster, which forms the international stock market network. Tird, the Asia-Pacifc cluster exerts a weak infuence on the stock markets of other regions. Similarly, the Middle Eastern and African cluster is marginalized in the international stock market network.\n(ii) Te strong connectedness within every cluster confrms the signifcant geographical aggregation efect. Te connectedness among stock markets in the same region is stronger than that among stock markets in diferent regions. Tis feature is more evident in the European cluster than in the others.\n(iii) Te structure of the international stock market network varies over time, and each cluster has a relatively fxed central node. In the European cluster, France is located in the center, and it exerts a signifcant infuence on the European cluster and the entire network in the sample period. Singapore is the central node of the Asia-Pacifc cluster, and the United States is the central node of the\nAmerican cluster. Te Middle Eastern and African cluster has no central node because of its marginal position in the network.\n(iv) A country\u2019s position in the network is closely related to its economic and fnancial development, and the distances between nodes refect the fnancial connections between the countries. Developed countries are relatively concentrated and closely linked, while developing countries are on themargins of the network. It is worth noting that the connectedness of the international stock market increases markedly during major public events, indicating that fnancial crises are contagious.\n4.2. System-Level Connectedness. We investigate the systemic connectedness of the international stock market at public events by combining the DTW-based network with the full-sample analysis and using GE as the statistical index. We also adopt the sliding window method to determine the time-varying property of GE. Following Liu and Wan\u2019s [60] judgment regarding time window width, we use a longer time window width in order to capture the long-term trend of the international stock market accurately. A shorter time window width should be used to analyze the short-term dynamic impacts of fnancial crises, economic cycles, and seasonal factors on stock markets. Following Liu and Wan [61], we set the time window width at 250 trading days (approximately one year) and the step length at fve trading days (one week).\nAs shown in Figure 7, the GE of the international stock market network fuctuates in a range of [0.06, 0.08] during the sample period. In Period I, the GE maintains a low level, from 0.062 to 0.071, because the international stock market is stable. In Period II, the GE soars and reaches its peak value at the end of 2008. Afterward, it gradually declines and returns to a normal value by the end of the US subprime crisis in 2009. During Period III, the GE declines but then increases relatively rapidly in mid-2011. During Period IV, the GE rises and then falls, declining to its lowest value at the beginning of 2018. During Period V, the GE once again presents an upward trend and reaches its second-highest peak in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTus, the sharp increase in GE occurs in four of the fve periods, which correspond to the following public events: (i) the US subprime crisis from 2007 to 2009; (ii) the European debt crisis in 2011; (iii) the US Fed\u2019s frst interest rate hike in 10 years and China\u2019s A-share stock disaster in 2015; and (iv) the period of Sino\u2013US trade friction in 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. By contrast, the GE remains low with small fuctuations during Period I and other periods when no major public events occur. We fnd that public events exacerbate the volatility of stock markets at a certain stage and strengthen their linkages, which increase aggregation in the network and cause GE to reach its peak.\nIn terms of change amplitude, the most violent increase in GE happened during the US subprime crisis, followed by the world economic recession triggered by the hike in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate, the Chinese A-share stock\ndisaster, and, fnally, the European debt crisis. Among these, the European debt crisis imposes a signifcant impact on Europe but has limited global spread. Terefore, global public events (such as the US subprime crisis) exert a much greater impact on stock markets than do regional public events (such as the European debt crisis).\n4.3. Region-Level Connectedness. Te stock markets cluster in each of the regions. Following Wang et al. [59], we propose a measure of regional connectedness, shown in equations (6) and (7), to explore the commonly found geographical aggregation (the regional clustering efect in our case) in the international stock market. Table 3 displays the estimations of regional connectedness, where the connectedness between one region and all others (total connectedness) is equal to the corresponding of-diagonal row sums (or column sums). Te within-region connectedness (diagonal elements) is signifcantly stronger than the crossregion connectedness (of-diagonal elements), with the exception of that between the Middle East & Africa and America. Te major reason why these two regions have high connectedness is the frequent oil trade between the United States and Middle Eastern countries.\nWe fnd that the stock markets of 22 countries in Europe are highly interconnected. By contrast, the Middle East and Africa have the lowest within-region connectedness, indicating a weak infuence on the international stock market. Furthermore, the American, Middle Eastern, & African regions are the two highest in terms of total connectedness, manifesting the powerful infuence of the US dollar and oil exports. Europe and Asia-Pacifc show the third and fourth highest total connectedness levels, respectively. Although Japan and Singapore exert a strong infuence on the network, most Asia-Pacifc countries are emerging markets with weak infuence. Tus, the total connectedness of this region is not high."

            "text": "Risk contagion speeds and intensities difer among the nodes in the international stock market network when a public event breaks out. Based on the scale, relevance, and globality of the systemically important stock markets, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of risk contagion speed and intensity to analyze their infuence.\nTe measure of risk contagion speed is defned as the number of stock markets infected by the source of risk (a single stock market) within a certain time. Te degree of a node is defned as the number of edges directly connected to it, which can be used to represent risk and contagion speed. We can also measure the intensity of risk contagion by calculating the connectedness between one stock market and other stock markets that are connected to it in the network.\nWe select the IS index, which considers the degree of a node and the weight of the edges (the correlation coefcient between stock markets), to examine the infuence of\nthe stock markets. Te greater the IS of a stock market, the stronger its efects on the international stock market network.\nWe calculate the IS of each node to identify the systemically important stockmarkets and analyze their network structure over diferent time periods. Te top fve nodes in each period are shown in Table 4. At public events, the top fve nodes of the network are diferent across the fve periods. Te IS in Period I with no public events is signifcantly lower than that in Period II. Furthermore, Periods III, IV, and V correspond to the European debt crisis, the hike in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate, and the period of Sino-US trade friction, and the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Te harm of these events is less intense than that of the US subprime crisis.Terefore, the IS in the latter three periods is higher than that in Period I and lower than that in Period II. Tis indicates that public events make the international stock market network more compact and the IS accordingly higher, which matches the conclusion drawn from the timevarying GE curve.\nMeanwhile, we fnd that the top fve nodes based on IS in all periods are all from the European cluster, which coincides with the powerful infuence of Europe. Consistent with the outcomes shown in Figures 2\u20136, the European cluster is in the center of the international stock market network, and it dominates the other nodes and clusters. France is in the top fve nodes in all periods and is extremely important in the network. Moreover, the United Kingdom entered the top fve during the US subprime crisis. Afterwards, it declines and withdraws from the top fve; thus, the leading position of\nthe United Kingdom is highlighted during this period. Te Netherlands ranks among the top fve nodes in four of the fve periods and is especially high in Periods III and IV, refecting its signifcant infuence. Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, and Spain are also among the top fve nodes in the fve periods, which demonstrates that these countries signifcantly afect the international stock market.\nTaken together, these results show that, frst, the international stock market is greatly impacted by France and that Europe is the most important cluster in the network. Tis result occurs for two reasons. Europe\u2019s economy and fnance are exceedingly integrated within the European Union, and stock markets in Europe have strong internal connectedness and thus have a signifcant infuence on the stock markets of other regions. Second, the United States and Singapore have the highest IS in the American and AsiaPacifc clusters, respectively, because the United States is the world\u2019s largest economy and holds an extremely important position in the international fnancial market, and Singapore is the fnancial center of Asia. Tird, Japan\u2019s IS exceeded Singapore\u2019s during the global economic recession, and it is prominent in the Asian fnancial market. Tus, Singapore and Japan are the most infuential nodes in the Asia-Pacifc region."

            "text": "Te fndings show that France, the United States, and Singapore/Japan are the most systemically important stock markets in their respective regions. China is the world\u2019s\nsecond-largest economy and has a growing infuence on the international fnancial system. Tus, we next explore the importance of these markets in the international stock market network. Te importance index we select is the tree length, which is the shortest distance when one stock market merges into the MST. We obtain it by calculating the connectedness between the node and its neighboring nodes in the network. We take the average importance indicator of the international stock market as a baseline. Te normalized tree length (NTL) can be used to measure the average distance among nodes in order to explore the overall connectedness strength of the international stock market after redundant relationships are \u201cfltered out.\u201d\nAs mentioned, we adopt the sliding window method to detect the time-varying property of the tree length and set the sliding time window width to 250 trading days. To measure market importance in the network, we calculate the time-varying NTL as well as the FRTL, USTL, SGTL, JPTL, and CNTL, as shown in Figure 8. We conclude that their stock markets are more important than the average level in the network if the tree lengths are below the NTL; otherwise, their stock markets are less important.\n(i) Te average NTL for the full-sample period is 0.3355, and the values in the fve periods are 0.3462, 0.3142, 0.4301, 0.3431, and 0.3385, respectively. Since 2004, the NTL curve has fuctuated around 0.35 in a relatively high position. Afected by the US subprime crisis, it shows a downward trend during\nPeriod II from 0.3309 to 0.3084. Afterward, the NTL in Period III rises because the global fnancial environment is resurgent at the end of the US subprime crisis. It displays a short-term decline in 2012 and quickly recovers due to the European debt crisis. Ten, the NTL frst descends and then rises from 2015 to 2016 because several Black Swan events in the international fnancial system, such as the US Fed\u2019s frst rise in interest rates in a decade, the plummeting crude oil price, Brexit, and the Chinese stock market disaster, run through Period IV. Furthermore, the NTL declines slightly during the period of Sino\u2013US trade friction in 2018, and it falls sharply after the COVID-19 outbreak. Next, it rises again in late 2020 and early 2021 as the COVID-19 epidemic is gradually brought under control. In general, the NTL during the sample period experiences three falling/rising cycles.\n(ii) Te FRTL is the lowest, and its fuctuation range is the largest among all fve tree lengths. As the core of the European cluster, France is much more important than the average level of the international stock market. Furthermore, the FRTL is low during public events, indicating that France is highly sensitive to them. It is noteworthy that the importance of France rose fastest frommid-2014 to the end of 2015, and the range of this increase was more dramatic than that of the average importance level.\n(iii) Te USTL is the closest to the NTL, but its fuctuation range is greater than the NTL\u2019s.Te USTL is also highly sensitive to public events, and its sharp decline occurred during the US subprime crisis and the Sino-US trade friction period. By contrast, the emergence of the European debt crisis in 2012 and the hike in the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate in 2016 triggered only a small drop, which indicates that the connectedness between the United States and other markets is only weakly infuenced by these events. Furthermore, the US subprime crisis in 2007 and the period of Sino-US trade friction in 2018 exhibit a signifcant infuence on the importance of the United States. As the birthplace of these public events, the United States is obviously greatly afected by them.\n(iv) Te JPTL and SGTL are exceedingly close, and both are slightly higher than the NTL; this happens because Japan and Singapore have similar importance levels, and these are lower than the average. Te fuctuation of the JPTL during the European debt crisis is greater than that of the SGTL, indicating that the Japanese stock market is more sensitive to the European debt crisis than are other markets.\n(v) Te CNTL is much higher than the NTL, and it fuctuates within a small range after the US subprime crisis. In addition, the importance of China is lower than the average level, and its sensitivity to public events is weaker than that of other\nsystemically important stock markets. It is worth noting that the gap between the CNTL and NTL was widest during the US subprime crisis. Tus, the importance of China is lower during the US subprime crisis than in other periods, which minimizes the extent of economic recession and the risk of contagion during the crisis. Te Belt and Road Initiative also has a profound impact on the CNTL. During its implementation in 2015, the CNTL deviates from the NTL and declines; it approaches the NTL after the period of Sino-US trade friction. At that time, the importance of China reaches its peak. Te world\u2019s two largest economies, China and the United States, are in confict, which may continue to increase the China\u2019s importance. Moreover, the CNTL becomes relatively stable after the COVID-19 pandemic instead of declining sharply, as in other countries. One major reason for this is that China controls the risk of contagion caused by the COVID-19 pandemic efectively through its strong epidemic prevention measures."

            "text": "We build correlation networks using the DTW model and investigate the connectedness of the international stock market at public events at the system, region, and market levels.\n(i) At the systemic level, the public events increase market volatility and synergies among the stock markets. During times of stability, the network is relatively loose, and the connectedness among\nnodes is weak. By contrast, the network becomes integrated and compact after public events, indicating that a sharp increase in network connectedness may signal the emergence of fnancial crises. Additionally, the GE during the US subprime crisis was signifcantly higher than it was during the European debt crisis, indicating that global events have a greater impact on network connectedness than regional events have.\n(ii) At the regional level, Europe always occupies a core position in the network. Afected by strong withinregion connectedness, the network structure shows geographic regionalization. Stock markets in Europe are the most interconnected because of the integration of European fnance and economy. Contrariwise, stock markets in the Middle East and Africa have the lowest within-region connectedness, due to their chaotic political situations and backward fnancial systems. America, the Middle East, and Africa are top-ranked in terms of total connectedness manifesting the powerful infuence of the US dollar and oil exports. Europe and AsiaPacifc are ranked lowest in terms of total connectedness.\n(iii) At the market level, France, the United States, and Singapore/Japan are the systemically most important stock markets in their respective regions. In particular, France exhibits the strongest infuence in all fve periods. Moreover, the infuence of China increases rapidly, reaching its peak during the period of Sino-US trade friction, which shows that\npublic events exert an important impact on the countries involved and that the dominance of the international fnancial system by European and American countries is changing.\nOur research studies ofer insights useful for investment strategies and systemic risk warning measures for the international stock market, while also providing regulatory authorities with important suggestions regarding fnancial supervision.\n(i) Considering the periodicity of risk contagion among stock markets, governments need to make discretionary choices regarding risk sources, event processes, and categories (i.e., global vs. regional events). Public events are most intense in their early stages, which is often accompanied by a dramatic increase in stock market connectedness. During this stage, authorities should implement policies designed to strengthen bailout eforts, control market liquidity, curb capital outfow, and stabilize investor sentiment.\n(ii) Investors should pay more attention to the European stock market, especially the French stock market, when making investment decisions, given the signifcant infuence of Europe in the international stock market network. China\u2019s infuence on the international stock market has been rising since the Belt and Road initiative began in 2015. It reached its peak during the period of Sino-US trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world\u2019s largest emerging stock market, China is having an increasingly signifcant impact on other stock markets due to its openness.\n(iii) Amid the increasing risks in the international fnancial system, authorities should implement rescue policies to reduce the breadth and depth of public events in consideration of the regional clustering efect. Since within-region connectedness is higher than cross-region connectedness in most instances, all countries should pay more attention to the stock markets in their own region, especially those that are systemically important. Stock markets with high IS rankings should also be taken seriously. Additionally, as the Middle East and Africa was closely linked with America, countries in these two regions should focus on their connectedness to prevent fnancial risks. For example, the Middle Eastern and African countries should be cautious about fnancial risks coming from America, particularly the United States, whose stock market is systemically important."
