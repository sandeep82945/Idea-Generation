    "abstractText": "Due to their ability to self-assemble into complex structures, block copolymers are of great interest for use in a wide range of future applications, such as self-healing materials. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of their structure formation. In particular, the process engineering of the formation and transition of the polymer structures is required for ensuring reproducibility and scalability, but this has received little attention in the literature. In this article, the influence of the addition rate of the selective solvent on the homogeneity of self-assembled vesicles of polystyrene-block-polyacrylic acid is demonstrated, as well as the influence of the reaction time and the mixing intensity on the morphology of the polymer structures. For example, it was demonstrated that the higher the mixing intensity, the faster the transition from micelle to vesicle. The experimental results are further supported by CFD simulations, which visually and graphically show an increase in shear rate and narrower shear rate distributions at higher stirring rates. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the vesicle size is not only kinetically determined, since flow forces above a critical size lead to the deformation and fission of the vesicles.",

            "text": "An example of self-organizing systems from nature is the assembly of phospholipids to form our cell membrane [1]. The principle is based on a non-covalent association of amphiphilic molecules, which enables a high nanoscale structural precision, as it is mandatory, for example, in the development of functional nanosystems [2,3]. To transfer this principle, an in-depth understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of selfassembly processes is essential. For this purpose, block copolymers are very suitable as model amphiphiles, since their molecular weights are very high compared to low-molecular weight surfactants. As a result, phase transitions take place much more slowly, so that the polymer structures could be investigated more comprehensively [4]. A very common method for triggering self-organization is the co-solvent method. First, the block copolymer is dissolved in a solvent (usually organic) that has a high affinity for both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile. By adding a selective solvent such as water, the block copolymers assemble into mesoscopic structures above a critical amount of solvent (critical water content, or cwc) with the aim of generating the smallest possible interface. This method is also called microphase separation because it is characterized by the precipitation of the insoluble part of the block copolymer (usually the hydrophobic part), while the other part (usually the hydrophilic part) remains in\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1695. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15071695 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1695 2 of 17\nsolution [1]. The ratio of the volume of the hydrophobic part v to the contact area of the hydrophilic part a0 and the length of the hydrophobic part lc of the block copolymer determines which associate structure will be formed. This ratio, which was first described in 1976 by Israelachvili et al. [5], is known as the so-called packing parameter p, and this is defined by the following equation (Equation (1)):\np = v/(a0 \u00d7 lc) (1)\nA polymer molecule showing p \u2264 1/3 tends to form spherical micelles, a molecule with p \u2265 1/3 and p \u2264 1/2 cylindrical micelles, and a molecule with p \u2265 1/2 and p \u2264 1 lamellae or vesicles. If the packing parameter is greater than 1, the above-mentioned structures are formed in the opposite order as inverse structures [1]. The packing parameter of a polymer molecule, and thus, the morphology of the block copolymer structure, should, however, by no means be regarded as fixed. Different authors have described, the effects of the type and amount of solvent and antisolvent [6,7], the composition of the block copolymer [8,9], and the concentration of the polymer, as well as the presence of additives [9]. In addition to the above-mentioned structures, much more complex morphologies have been observed, for example, as metastable transition morphologies [10]. Therefore, many different and partly complex morphologies have been obtained from block copolymers, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles [7,8,11], disc-like micelles [12,13], toroids [14], spherical particles with gated nanopores [15], vesicles (e.g., genus vesicles, multi-compartment vesicles, Janus vesicles, and onion-like vesicles) [16], lamellar structures, network-like structures [7,11], helical structures [17], and many more [18] could be revealed so far. This diversity results in many potential applications, such as in the fields of nanocomposites [7,19], biomaterials [20], drug delivery systems [21\u201324], nanoreactors [25], or as self-healing materials [26]. In recent years, some research has been performed on the pathways of the morphological transitions from one polymer structure to the other. Amongst others, the transitions from micelles to vesicles [12,27,28], micelles to cylinders [4,28,29], cylinders to disk-like micelles [12], cylinders to donuts [14,30], and cylinders to vesicles [31,32], were investigated. Despite the great interest, the complete mechanism of the structure transitions has not yet been completely clarified. A previously well-accepted but rather simple view assumes that the vesicles form via a two-step process. First, a bilayer membrane is formed from the polymer chains, which bends and closes in the next step to form a hollow structure. In reality, however, the occurring processes are believed to be much more complicated [33]. Leng et al. [12] demonstrated that micelles (spherical and cylindrical) transform into disklike intermediate micelles in a first, very fast step (within 1 s). Subsequently, growth occurs through contact and coalescence between disk-like micelles up to a critical radius r*. Once this critical size has been reached, the vesicles are finally formed through the closing of the structures. The transition morphology is reminiscent of a basket. The subsequent ripening of the vesicles could not be observed directly, but was expected if there was enough time to reach equilibrium. A very similar mechanism was found by Rank et al. [34]. Burke and Eisenberg [4], observed that cylindrical micelles were formed from spherical micelles. This was followed by a rapid adhesive collision of micelles to \u201cpearl necklace\u201d structures, and their subsequent reorganization to smooth cylindrical micelles. Furthermore, in addition to the theory of disk-like structures as the transition morphology between cylinders and vesicles, the formation of donuts from cylinders is also currently being discussed. It is postulated that there is a curvature and a subsequent linking of one end to the other end of the cylinder [30,35,36]. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no literature that has investigated the influence of the process parameters studied here on the micelle-to-vesicle transitions from block copolymers. So far, the temperature has been a well-studied process parameter [37\u201340]. For example, Sundararaman et al. [38] demonstrated that small spherical micelles of the triblock copolymer PEO-b-PNIPAM-b-PI (poly(ethylene oxide)-b-PNIPAM-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1695 3 of 17\nb-poly(isoprene)) existed in 20 \u25e6C warm water, which could be converted to vesicles when the water temperature was increased to 65 \u25e6C. Therefore, the aim of this work was to improve the knowledge by investigating the effects of important process parameters on the intra- and interparticle interactions of mesoscopic block copolymer structures, allowing for a deeper understanding of the structure formation and transformation processes. Therefore, we want to highlight the influence of the rate of the addition of the selective solvent to the polymer solution, stirring speed, reaction time (the time between the last addition of the selective solvent and the freezing of the current state (referred to herein as the structure formation time)) on the morphology and the dimension of the polymer structures, and thereby derive structure formation mechanisms from micelle to vesicle. In addition, the CFD simulations of the flows in the piston during the experiment will support our results and assumptions."

The polymer solution was then placed in a 25 mL round bottom flask, diluted with THF or dioxane, and the flask made airtight with septa. To prevent solvent loss due to evaporation during the experiments, the flasks were kept tightly closed for the entire duration and only opened for a short moment, e.g., to take a sample or to add a selective solvent. Consequently, no changes in volume due to evaporation losses were observed. The polymer solutions were then stirred at high speed (400 rpm) for 15 min after dilution to ensure adequate mixing. Water was subsequently added as a selective solvent at a fixed ratio and stirring speed, according to the test conditions of the parameter matrix (see Figure 1).

For this purpose, water was successively added to 0.1 wt% PS-b-PAA solutions in THF and dioxane, and the particle size was measured. A significant rise in particle size, and therefore, an indication of the critical water content (cwc) was determined for the solvent THF at 12.2 wt%, and for dioxane, at 7.3 wt% (compare Figure 4).\nFigure 3. Generated mesh (a) and fluid phases (b) of the developed setup. The edges of the geometries are shown in colour (blue = piston and red = stirrer).\nThe regions of polymer solution and air were generated with \u201csetFields\u201d in such a way where the flask was filled with solution, up to a height of 10 mm. To estimate the turbulence of the flow, Reynolds numbers (usi g Equation (2), where \u03c1fl is the fluid density, n the stirrer velocity, d the diameter of the stirrer, and \u03b7 the dynamic viscosity of the fluid), were calculated using material ata from the lite ature for the ensity and vi cosity of\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1695 6 of 17\nthe fluid [43]. Water at Tfl = 20 \u25e6C was assumed for the parameters of the solution. The stirring bar velocity was set to 10.47 (100 rpm) and 41.89 rad s\u22121 (400 rpm), respectively. The Reynolds numbers for both stirring velocities were well below the threshold of 10,000 (approx. 371 and 1483, respectively), which meant that laminar flow could be assumed for the simulation.\nRestirring = (\u03c1fl \u00d7 n \u00d7 d2)/\u03b7 (2)\nThe basic governing equations (the conservations of mass and momentum) were calculated using the basic Navier\u2013Stokes equations. The equations of continuity and motion were solved to attain the velocities and velocity profiles. Thereafter, shear rates were calculated for each cell and then transferred into a distribution. For each speed of the stirrer, after 10 revolutions (6 or 1.5 s, at 100 or 400 rpm), the results of the next 10 revolutions (up to 12 or 3 s, respectively) were averaged to account for the transient type simulation. Images of the setup and the flow pattern were generated using ParaView 5.6.0. For the initial conditions at the walls, a zero flux was imposed to the computational domains, and the gravity was set to 9.81 m s\u22121."

The more similar the Hansen parameters of the solvent and polystyrene, the better the solubility and the greater the amount of selective solvent that is necessary to induce microphase separation. The Hansen parameter of THF amounts to 19.46, and thus, it is more similar to the parameter of polystyrene of 19.26 than the one of dioxane with 20.47 [44]. As a result, experimentally determined differences in the critical water contents are expected.

Furthermore, Table 2 shows that in addition to a broadening of the vesicle size distribution with a fast addition of water, the average vesicle size also tends to increase. Here, the dominant effect is assumed to be Ostwald ripening. Accordingly, the large particles continue to grow, at the expense of the small particles.

Representative SEM images of the morphologies of the polymer structures as a function of the structure formation time and the stirring speed.\nAs it can be observed from Figures 7 and 8, both the mixing intensity and the structure formation time have a significant influence on the morphology of the resulting polymer structure. If there is no mixing (0 rpm), a few cylinders and numerous micelles can be observed. If the mixing intensity increases to 400 rpm, the number of cylinders also increases. This is shown graphically in Figure 7 in such a way that the number of morphologies indicates their frequency in the sample (one cylinder = few, and two cylinders = significantly more cylindrical structures detected). However, no significant difference in the number of cylinders between 0 rpm and 100 rpm can be observed. A similar increase in the ratio of formed cylinders can be observed when increasing the structure formation time for a low mixing intensity. Furthermore, it can be observed that with a further rise in the mixing intensity and/or structure formation time, the cylinders disappear completely and the vesicles are detected instead. With a high probability, the latter can be regarded as the equilibrium morphology, which is why we assume that our system has a packing parameter of between 1/2 and 1, since, as known from the literature [5], vesicles are present at this packing parameter. It is obvious that the cylindrical structures reorganize into spherical structures for longer structure formation times. In summary, both time and kinetic energy (due to mixing) have a significant influence on the vesicle formation process. The higher the structure formation time and the higher the mixing intensity, the faster the formation of vesicles as the equilibrium structure occurs. We postulate that, essentially, a higher shear rate at higher rotational speeds leads to larger collision probabilities, which accelerates the structure formation mechanisms. This is also suggested by our simulative experiments. In Figure 9, the shear rate distributions of the fluids are plotted for 100 rpm and for 400 rpm. It can be observed that with an increase in speed, a higher shear rate can be obtained. This can be observed particularly significantly for x90. A disproportionate increase in the shear rate from 58.35 s\u22121 to 323.9 s\u22121 was determined here.\nFigure 8.

The hydrophilic part PAA is shown in blue and the hydrophobic part PS of the block copolymer is shown in red.\nRegarding the dimensional change of the cylinders based on the SEM evaluation, it can be observed that the average length of the cylinders rises continuously with the increasing mixing intensity (363.7 nm \u00b1 313.0 nm, n = 53 (0 rpm, 0 h), 409.0 nm \u00b1 228.9 nm, n = 48 (100 rpm, 0 h), and 493.2 nm \u00b1 583.5 nm, n = 90 (400 rpm, 0 h)). In the absence of mixing, a longer structure formation time also leads to longer cylinders (compare 0 rpm at 0 h and 3 h (489.1 nm \u00b1 374.0 nm, n = 89)). It could also be determined that with a value of 493.2 nm, the average cylinder length at 400 rpm and 0 h corresponds approximately to the average length after 3 h at 0 rpm with 489.1 nm. It is obvious that the cylinders have a critical length that roughly corresponds to this length, since only vesicles are present in the samples as the structure formation progresses. The cylinder growth can also be attributed to higher collision probabilities because of higher shear rates. It is expected that the collision of micelles with cylinders, as well as the collision of two cylinders, leads to growth. In contrast, the growth due to individual polymer molecules in the solution will play a rather minor role, since solutions with block copolymers have a very low critical micelle concentration, and therefore, the number of monomers is likely to be low [45]. A structure formation mechanism from micelle to vesicle can be established from the SEM images (compare Figure 11). In the first step, spherical micelles are formed, which then, upon contact, initially assemble into \u201cpearl necklaces\u201d (Figure 11a). Burke and Eisenberg previously postulated a reorganization mechanism resulting in smooth cylindrical structures [4], and indeed, such structures can also be observed (Figure 11b), although we could not resolve the kinetics of this process, as both states occur at the same time step. When stirring at higher rates, longer cylinders form that partially become curved (Figure 11c), whilst after an extended reaction time, an increasing proportion of vesicles can be observed (Figure 11d,e). Hence, we postulate that the cylinders grow to a critical length lc* and ultimately form the vesicles. Additionally, we could observe basket structures as an intermediate state (a clear basket structure can be observed in Figure 11d), and vesicles with a small punctual opening on their surface (the red circle indicates the example in Figure 11e), which indicates that they were formed from the basket structures. These transitional structures suggest that previously, disk-like structures had formed as intermediates. It is conceivable that these disk structures were created through a fusion of micelles\nFigure 10. Influence of stirring speed and structure formation time on the lengths of the cylinders (A).

In the absence of mixing, a longer structure formation time also leads to longer cylinders (compare 0 rpm at 0 h and 3 h (489.1 nm \u00b1 374.0 nm, n = 89)). It could also be determined that with a value of 493.2 nm, the average cylinder length at 400 rpm and 0 h corresponds approximately to the average length after 3 h at 0 rpm with 489.1 nm. It is obvious that the cylinders have a critical length that roughly corresponds to this length, since only vesicles are present in the samples as the structure formation progresses.

It is expected that the collision of micelles with cylinders, as well as the collision of two cylinders, leads to growth. In contrast, the growth due to individual polymer molecules in the solution will play a rather minor role, since solutions with block copolymers have a very low critical micelle concentration, and therefore, the number of monomers is likely to be low [45]. A structure formation mechanism from micelle to vesicle can be established from the SEM images (compare Figure 11). In the first step, spherical micelles are formed, which then, upon contact, initially assemble into \u201cpearl necklaces\u201d (Figure 11a).

When stirring at higher rates, longer cylinders form that partially become curved (Figure 11c), whilst after an extended reaction time, an increasing proportion of vesicles can be observed (Figure 11d,e).

These transitional structures suggest that previously, disk-like structures had formed as intermediates. It is conceivable that these disk structures were created through a fusion of micelles and cylinders, and then they reorganized into flat, round structures. As schematically shown in Figure 7, the number of cylinders increases with time and mixture intensity, which also increments the likelihood of contacts between the cylinders. The key factor here is that the cylinders or disks must curve to form vesicles. The predominant driving force here is the minimization of free energy due to the open-end caps of the cylinders. On the other hand, there is the bending modulus, which has to be small enough to allow for curvature [46]. This bending module is, of course, very high for small cylinders, as compared to large cylinders. Thus, we assume that the cylinders grow to the size where the bending modulus becomes small enough to enable curling, which corresponds to the critical length lc*. Once the vesicles are formed, they grow until they reach kinetic equilibrium. Therefore, the vesicles continued to be observed for a total of 24 h at different mixing intensities (see Figure 12). If only the experimental series with a structure formation time of 3 h is considered, an increase in the vesicle size can be determined with the higher mixing intensity (169.4 nm \u00b1 49.2 nm, n = 260 (100 rpm, 3 h) and 281.6 nm \u00b1 59.1 nm, n = 225 (400 rpm, 3 h)). As has already been discussed for the cylinder growth, this is mainly a result of a higher collision probability via an increased particle movement. Likewise, a significant rise in particle size over time at the same rotation speed can be observed (compare 100 rpm at 3 h and 100 rpm at 24 h (1215.7 nm \u00b1 563.5 nm, n = 216)), which is also attributed to a higher contact probability. If, on the other hand, the experimental series at 24 h is considered, an insightful trend can be observed. Between 0 rpm (1247.1 nm \u00b1 863.2 nm, n = 276) and 100 rpm, there seems to be no significant difference in vesicle size. We assume that the vesicle size of the kinetic equilibrium was already reached. If, on the other hand, the mixing intensity is raised further, a significant decrease in the vesicle size can be observed\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1695 13 of 17\n(810.9 nm \u00b1 629.1 nm, n = 240 (400 rpm, 24 h)). A possible conclusion would be that flow-induced forces become relevant at above a critical vesicle size. When the deforming stresses acting on the vesicle surface exceed the retained stresses, particle rupture occurs, or in the case of polymer vesicles, fission occurs. Accordingly, the vesicle size of the kinetic equilibrium would also depend on the prevailing flow conditions.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19\nand cylinders, and then they reorganized into flat, round structures.

This bending module is, of cours , very high for small cylinders, as compared to larg cylinders. Thus, we a sum that the cylinders grow to the size where the bending modulus becomes small e ough to enabl curling, which corresponds t the critical length lc*.\nFigure 1 .

Conclusions In this study, we investigated the influences of the process engineering aspects on structure formation, as well as studied the transition pathways from micelle to vesicle, in the self-assembled mesoscopic block copolymer structures of PS-b-PAA. Specifically, the process parameters were the rate of addition of the selective solvent, the duration of the structure formation, and the mixing intensity. Our results demonstrate that a slower addition of the selective solvent to the polymer solution tends to result in more homogeneous systems, and consequently, narrower vesicle size distributions. In addition, the mixing intensity and the duration of the process have been demonstrated to have a significant effect on the morphologies and the dimensions of the polymer structures. We postulated that higher structure formation times and stirring speeds, and thus, higher shear rates, increase the collision probabilities between polymer structures, and thus shorten the time of phase transformations, which is further supported by CFD simulations. Finally, from these results, formation mechanisms from micelles to vesicles could be derived, which are in good agreement with the previous findings in the literature, and furthermore complement them in a useful way. However, a classical formation mechanism (a change in morphology only over time) is not presented here, since both the time factor and the mixing intensity factor were investigated. Based on the observations made in this study, it can be assumed that a morphological transition occurs via the formation of micelles, which then assemble into \u201cpearl necklace\u201d structures and subsequently fuse or reorganize into smooth cylindrical structures. These cylinders then grow to a critical length to ultimately close into vesicles. The final step likely occurs via intermediate disklike structures, forming the curvature of the disks into basket structures, and finally, the closure of the structure to form the final vesicle structure. These vesicles then ripen into larger structures through fusion processes. However, in a system where mechanical energy is continuously introduced (as in this case, through stirring), the vesicles can only\nFigure 13.

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the influences of the process engineering aspects on structure formation, as well as studied the transition pathways from micelle to vesicle, in the self-assembled mesoscopic block copolymer structures of PS-b-PAA. Specifically, the process parameters were the rate of addition of the selective solvent, the duration of the structure formation, and the mixing intensity. Our results demonstrate that a slower addition of the selective solvent to the polymer solution tends to result in more homogeneous systems, and consequently, narrower vesicle size distributions. In addition, the mixing intensity and the duration of the process have been demonstrated to have a significant effect on the morphologies and the dimensions of the polymer structures. We postulated that higher structure formation times and stirring speeds, and thus, higher shear rates, increase the collision probabilities between polymer structures, and thus shorten the time of phase transformations, which is further supported by CFD simulations. Finally, from these results, formation mechanisms from micelles to vesicles could be derived, which are in good agreement with the previous findings in the literature, and furthermore complement them in a useful way. However, a classical formation mechanism (a change in morphology only over time) is not presented here, since both the time factor and the mixing intensity factor were investigated. Based on the observations made in this study, it can be assumed that a morphological transition occurs via the formation of micelles, which then assemble into \u201cpearl necklace\u201d structures and subsequently fuse or reorganize into smooth cylindrical structures. These cylinders then grow to a critical length\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1695 15 of 17\nto ultimately close into vesicles. The final step likely occurs via intermediate disk-like structures, forming the curvature of the disks into basket structures, and finally, the closure of the structure to form the final vesicle structure. These vesicles then ripen into larger structures through fusion processes. However, in a system where mechanical energy is continuously introduced (as in this case, through stirring), the vesicles can only grow to a critical size, as flow-induced forces cause deformation and trigger fission. Accordingly, the vesicle size is, on the one hand, determined by kinetics, but it is also significantly dependent on the process parameters.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15071695/s1, Figure S1: Representation of the simulated velocity profile at stirring rates of 100 and 400 rpm.
