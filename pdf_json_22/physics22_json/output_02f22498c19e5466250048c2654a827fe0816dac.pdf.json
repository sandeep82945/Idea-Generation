    "abstractText": "The atomic scale local structures affect the initiation performance of ultra-fine explosives according to the stimulation results of hot spot formation. However, the experimental characterization of local structures in ultra-fine explosives has been rarely reported, due to the difficulty in application of characterization methods having both high resolution in and small damage to unstable organic explosive materials. In this work, X-ray total scattering was explored to investigate the atomic scale local distortion of two widely applicable ultra-fine explosives, LLM-105 and HNS. The experimental spectra of atomic pair distribution function (PDF) derived from scattering results were fitted by assuming rigid ring structures in molecules. The effects of grain refinement and thermal aging on the atomic scale local structure were investigated, and the changes in both the length of covalent bonds have been identified. Results indicate that by decreasing the particle size of LLM-105 and HNS from hundreds of microns to hundreds of nanometers, the crystal structures remain, whereas the molecular configuration slightly changes and the degree of structural disorder increases. For example, the average length of covalent bonds in LLM-105 reduces from 1.25 \u00c5 to 1.15 \u00c5, whereas that in HNS increases from 1.25 \u00c5 to 1.30 \u00c5, which is possibly related to the incomplete crystallization process and internal stress. After thermal aging of ultra-fine LLM-105 and HNS, the degree of structural disorder decreases, and the distortion in molecules formed in the synthesis process gradually healed. The average length of covalent bonds in LLM-105 increases from 1.15 \u00c5 to 1.27 \u00c5, whereas that in HNS reduces from 1.30 \u00c5 to 1.20 \u00c5. The possible reason is that the atomic vibration in the molecule intensifies during the heat aging treatment, and the internal stress was released through changes in molecular configuration, and thus the atomic scale distortion gradually heals. The characterization method and findings in local structures obtained in this work may pave the path to deeply understand the relationship between the defects and performance of ultra-fine explosives.",

            "text": "Ultra-fine explosives with a particle size around hundreds of nanometers show both high safety and high reliability, and have been widely applied in aerospace, military, and industry. For example, ultra-fine 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) [1] and ultra-fine 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032,6,6\u2032-hexanitro diphenylethylene (HNS) [2] show low sensitivity to impact, but high-sensitivity, short-duration pulsed shock waves with high pressure, which is called selectivity of the sensitivity [3], and have been used as advanced initiating explosives in detonators. The selectivity of the sensitivity of ultra-fine explosives is the key to their performance in applications. According to the hot spot theory, the selectivity of the sensitivity is highly related to the size and number of defects in explosives [4,5]. A\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6835. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15196835 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6835 2 of 12\nlot of numerical simulation works have reported the process of forming hot spots from defects in explosives such as atomic scale local distortion structures and nano pores [6\u201316]. Armstrong and Coffey [17,18] revealed that the dislocation region releases a large amount of heat under shock, and promotes the formation of hot spots, indicating the important role of local distortion structures for sensitivity. However, the distortion structures used in simulations were assumptive, which results in deviation between simulation and reality. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the experimental characterization of the atomic scale local distortion of ultra-fine explosives, which has been rarely reported. The commonly used characterization method for atomic scale distortion in materials is high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), which plays an important role in the research of inorganic materials. However, TEM cannot be directly used to characterize explosives because of the damage from electron beams [19\u201321]. In recent years, total scattering measurements and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis [22\u201324] have attracted attention in the field of condensed matter because of the advantages in high resolution for studying atomic scale structures and small damage to samples. PDF analysis is a powerful approach to study short- and intermediate-range order in materials on the nanoscale. It may be obtained from total scattering measurements using X-rays, neutrons, or electrons, and it provides structural details when defects, disorder, or structural ambiguities obscure their elucidation directly in reciprocal space. PDF analysis was originally developed to study the structure of amorphous, liquid, and other short-range ordered materials. At present, it has been widely used for nanocrystalline structures and atomic scale local structures of inorganic materials [25\u201330]. However, there are few examples of applying PDF analysis in organic materials because of the complex structures of organic molecules and crystals leading to the difficulty in result interpretation [31\u201334]. In this work, X-ray total scattering was explored to investigate the atomic scale local distortions of ultra-fine LLM-105 and ultra-fine HNS. The assumption of rigid ring structure in LLM-105 and HNS molecule was used for fitting the experimental PDF spectra that gives slight changes in molecular configuration. The effects of grain refinement and thermal aging on the atomic scale local structure were investigated, and the changes in both the length and angle of covalent bonds have been identified. The characterization method and findings in local structures obtained in this work may pave the path to deeply understand the relationship between the defects and performance of ultra-fine explosives."

It can be seen that the structural factor strength of ultra-fine LLM-105 and HNS is lower than that of raw materials, which is caused by the decrease of crystallinity after the\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6835 5 of 12\ngrain refinement of explosives. In Figure 3a,b, there are several peaks with overestimated strength, which may be caused by the orientation of raw material samples in glass tubes.\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 13\nafter the grain refinement of explosives. In Figure 3a,b, there are several peaks with over-\nestimated strength, which may be caused by the orientation of raw material samples in\nglass tubes.\nThe PDF transforms the structure information of material into the radial pair distri-\nbution of different bond length scales in real space, so that the unit cell information in\ntraditional crystallography is expressed by the bond length of atomic pair. Therefore, the\nshort-range and local structure information would not be masked by the long-range struc-\nture. In the atomic pair distribution function, the peak position represents the atomic pair\nspacing or bond length, the peak area represents the coordination number deducting the\naverage number density, and the peak width represents the degree of structural disorder\n(including static disorder, thermal disorder, and intrinsic broadening of the test). The\natomic pair peak attenuation in the radial range is closely related to the spatial scale of the\nordered structure of condensed matter, and the nearest neighbor coordination structure\nin the short-range scale corresponds to the atomic pair peak one by one.\nTo gain insight into how intramolecular and intermolecular atom\u2013atom distances ap-\npear in the PDF, we define the largest intramolecular atom\u2013atom distance as l and the\nshortest intermolecular atom\u2013atom distance as k. For the case of LLM-105, k \u2248 2.7 \u00c5. In the\nr region below k, the PDF curve contains only intramolecular atom\u2013atom distances with\nsharp narrow peaks. In the high-r region beyond l \u2248 6.7 \u00c5, the PDF curve contains only\nintermolecular atom\u2013atom distances, which yield broader peaks in the PDF curve. In the\nregion between k and l, the sharp intramolecular peaks and broad intermolecular peaks\ncoexist. For HNS, there is a similar law. The shortest intermolecular atom\u2013atom distance\nis k \u2248 3.0 \u00c5, and the maximum intramolecular atom\u2013atom distance is l \u2248 13.6 \u00c5.\nThe PDF curves obtained for explosives with different particle sizes are shown in\nFigure 4. The peak within the range of 1~2 \u00c5 is the strongest and the sharpest, which can be seen from Figure 4a,c. This is because the correlated motion of atoms: strongly bonded atoms tend to move together, dependent on each other. These motional correlations tend to die out smoothly with increasing distance [44]. It can be seen from Figure 4a that the PDF curve of ultra-fine LLM-105 is similar to that of raw LLM-105. Figure 4c shows that, the difference of PDF curve between raw and ultra-fine HNS is small in the range of 1\u20134.5 \u00c5 , and obvious in the range of 4.5\u201310 \u00c5 . Compared with LLM-105, the PDF curve changes more obviously after HNS grain refinement. This is because the particle size of HNS refined is smaller and the HNS molecule is larger. The refining method used in this study is recrystallization, in which the molecular arrangement is from disorder to order. The ultrafine HNS particle size is smaller than LLM-105, which means that the degree of crystallization is lower and the degree of disorder is larger. At the same time, the HNS molecule is larger than LLM-105, which means that the energy barrier of molecular rotation and\nThe P F transfor s the structure information of material into the radial pair distribution of different bond length scales in real space, so that the unit cell information in traditional crystallography is expressed by the bond length of atomic pair.

The PDF curves obtained for explosives ith different particle sizes are sho n in\nFigure 4. The peak within the range of 1~2 \u00c5 is the strongest and the sharpest, which\ncan be seen from Figure 4a,c. This is because the correlated motion of atoms: strongly\nbonded atoms tend to move together, dependent on each other. These motional correlations\ntend to die out smoothly with increasing distance [44]. It can be seen from Figure 4a that\nthe PDF curve of ultra-fine LLM-105 is similar to that of raw LLM-105. Figure 4c shows\nthat, the difference of PDF curve between raw and ultra-fine HNS is small in the range of\n1\u20134.5 \u00c5, and obvious in the range of 4.5\u201310 \u00c5. Compared with LLM-105, the PDF curve\nchanges more obviously after HNS grain refinement. This is because the particle size of\nHNS refined is smaller and the HNS molecule is larger. The refining method used in this\nstudy is recrystallization, in which the molecular arrangement is from disorder to order.\nThe ultra-fine HNS particle size is smaller than LLM-105, which means that the degree of\ncrystallization is lower and the degree of disorder is larger. At the same time, the HNS\nmolecule is larger than LLM-105, which means that the energy barrier of molecular rotation\nand configuration adjustment is higher. For the above two reasons, the change of PDF\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6835 6 of 12\ncurve after HNS grain refinement is more obvious than that of LLM-105. The peak positions of ultra-fine LLM-105 are shifted to the left compared with raw LLM-105 within 1\u20132.7 \u00c5. The peak area is reduced, and the peak width is widened. For example, the peak at 1.25 \u00c5 position moves from 1.25 \u00c5 to 1.15 \u00c5 (the peak at 1.25 \u00c5 corresponds to the average length of covalent bonds within the molecule), the peak width increases from 0.36 to 0.41, and the peak area decreases from 1.38 to 1.27. The results show that the distance between adjacent atomic pairs in the molecule decrease after LLM-105 is refined, and the degree of disorder increases. The decrease of atomic pair distance indicates that the interaction between atoms is enhanced. From Figure 4c, it can be found that the peak positions of ultra-fine HNS within 1\u20133 \u00c5 are shifted to the right compared with the raw HNS. For example, the peak at 1.25 \u00c5 moves from 1.25 \u00c5 to 1.30 \u00c5, and the peak area is reduced from 1.11 to 0.97. It shows that the reduction of particle size can increase the distance between adjacent atomic pairs in HNS molecule and weaken the interaction between atoms.

This program is used to fit the structure by moving a single atom, which is very useful for inorganic compounds. However, when fitting organic compounds with defined molecular composition, constraints need to be introduced to maintain the length of covalent bonds and rigid atom group that is usually called rigid body constraints in crystallography programs [33]. For LLM-105 molecule, the\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6835 7 of 12\npyrazine ring is rigid, and the stacking state of molecules inside the lattice does not change. The local structure distortion of LLM-105 possibly occurs on nitro and amino groups. For HNS, the benzene ring structure is rigid, but there may be relative displacement and deflection between the two benzene rings. Therefore, during the fitting process, the structures of both pyrazine rings and benzene rings were fixed. The fitting results in Figure 4b,d show that Rw of LLM-105 is much lower than HNS, indicating better fitting of LLM-105, which is possibly caused by the smaller molecular of LLM-105 than HNS. The PDF fitting of complex organic molecules is still a challenge [32]. The parameters of LLM-105 crystal structure model are shown in Table 1. The lattice parameters of ultra-fine LLM-105 do not change significantly compared with the raw materials.\nby 0.1 \u00c5 , the interaction between atomic pairs enhanced, and the disorder degree in-\ncreased. It is worth noting that the molecular configuration of LLM-105 also changed after\ngrain refinement. The distance of adjacent N\u2014N atoms on both sides of LLM-105 mole-\ncule increases, whereas the distance of O\u2014O atoms in nitro group decreases, which de-\nscribes the variations in angles of covalent bonds. After HNS is refined, the average length\nof covalent bonds increases by 0.05 \u00c5 , and the disorder degree increases. Therefore, the\ntotal scattering technique can be used to characterize the atomic scale local distortion of\nultra-fine explosives."

The results show that the distance of N2\u2014N3 and N5\u2014N6 atoms pairs in ultra-fine LLM-105 decreases and the interaction force between atoms increases after thermal aging treatment. However, the distance of O2\u2014O3 and O4\u2014O5 atomic pairs incr ases and the int r ction between atoms decreases. These results show that the change trend of covalent bond angle caused by aging is opposite to the r sult of refining, indicating that the disto tion formed during refining heal during aging.

This result is contrary to the change rule of l cal structure obtained in the previous secti . This is because, after the grain refinement of LLM-105 and HNS, the structures of the molecules were distorted possibly due to the incomplete crystallization process and internal stress. During the heat aging treatment, the atomic vibration in the molecule intensifies, and the internal stress was released through changes in molecular configuration, and thus the atomic scale distortion gradually heals. Although it is difficult to relate the atomic scale local structure of ultra-fine explosives obtained in this paper to the application of ultra-fine explosives, this result provides support for understanding the relationship between structure and explosive performance. In the latest research, it is found that the local structure has an impact on the performance [45], but these results are based on certain simulation assumptions. Our conclusion supports the hypothesis and makes the simulation better correlated with the actual performance."

(2) By decreasing the particle size of LLM-105 and HNS from hundreds of microns to hundreds of nanometers through recrystallization, the degree of structural disorder increases, and both length and angle of covalent bonds of molecules changes. The average length of covalent bonds in LLM-105 reduces from 1.25 \u00c5 to 1.15 \u00c5, whereas that in HNS increases from 1.25 \u00c5 to 1.30 \u00c5, which is possibly related to the incomplete crystallization process and internal stress.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6835 11 of 12\n(3) After thermal aging of ultra-fine LLM-105 and HNS, the degree of structural disorder decreases, and the distortion in molecules formed in the synthesis process gradually heals. The average length of covalent bonds in LLM-105 increases from 1.15 \u00c5 to 1.27 \u00c5, whereas that in HNS reduces from 1.30 \u00c5 to 1.20 \u00c5. The possible reason is that the atomic vibration in the molecule intensifies during the heat aging treatment, and the internal stress was released through changes in molecular configuration, and thus the atomic scale distortion gradually heals.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.L.
