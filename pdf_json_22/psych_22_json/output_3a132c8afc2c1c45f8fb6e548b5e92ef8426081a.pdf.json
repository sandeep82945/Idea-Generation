    "abstractText": "A comparative single-evaluation cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate cognitive damage in post-COVID-19 patients. The psychophysics tests of Two-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) and Simple Reaction Time (SRT), under a designed virtual environment, were used to evaluate the cognitive processes of decision-making, visual attention, and information processing speed. The population under study consisted of 147 individuals, 38 controls, and 109 post-COVID patients. During the 2AFC test, an Emotiv EPOC+\u00ae headset was used to obtain EEG signals to evaluate their Focus, Interest, and Engagement metrics. Results indicate that compared to healthy patients or recovered patients from mild-moderate COVID-19 infection, patients who recovered from a severe-critical COVID infection showed a poor performance in different cognitive tests: decision-making tasks required higher visual sensitivity (p = 0.002), Focus (p = 0.01) and information processing speed (p < 0.001). These results signal that the damage caused by the coronavirus on the central nervous and visual systems significantly reduces the cognitive processes capabilities, resulting in a prevalent deficit of 42.42% in information processing speed for mild-moderate cases, 46.15% for decision-making based on visual sensitivity, and 62.16% in information processing speed for severe-critical cases. A psychological follow-up for patients recovering from COVID-19 is recommended based on our findings.",

            "text": "After two plus years of the COVID-19 pandemic, an important impact on the global public health has been reported, with over 518 million confirmed cases and over six million deaths, according to the report by the World Health Organization of 15 May 2022 [1]. Health researchers have found that, while most of the infected population has been asymptomatic or has had mild symptoms with quick recovery, a fraction of the infected population has undergone several long-term symptoms [2]. Lopez-Leon et al. estimate that around 80% of the infected patients have developed at least one long-term symptom [3], mainly manifested through the peripheral organs, the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS respectively), the ocular system, and the cardiovascular and respiratory systems [2\u20134]. Several healthcare organizations began to report COVID-19-related neurological disorders based on cases around the globe and started to hypothesize a set of possible consequences derived from these disorders [5\u20139]. Neurological manifestations found in the CNS\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1258. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12091258 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1258 2 of 25\nand PNS show different grades of severity after a critical COVID infection [8]. These manifestations were mainly reported as cerebrovascular events (strokes), encephalopathies, encephalitis, confusion, and delirium, and in some cases, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [9]. In these cases, the use of electroencephalography (EEG) allows for identifying different abnormalities in the functioning of the CNS, opening the possibility of developing an earlier diagnosis of neurological impairments in critical patients, as well as a prompt proposal of adequate treatments after the infection [10,11]. Related to COVID-19 infection, there exists evidence of a rise in the disruption of the visual system [12,13]. Most of the common disruptions found are conjunctivitis, ocular pain, diplopia, visual impairment, eye dryness, red eyes, changes in the intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal changes, blurry vision, and light sensitivity [4,12,14,15]. On the other hand, there is evidence that when the infection of COVID-19 is accompanied by severe respiratory distress, it produces a significant impairment in certain cognitive processes, such as visual memory tasks, perception, and reasoning [16,17]. Furthermore, a decrease in the information processing speed, strongly related to reaction times, can be used as a risk estimator of death by COVID-19 [18]. Psychologists pay attention to the reaction time as a tool to evaluate the limitations on the nervous system functioning, becoming a referent for complex reasoning and knowledge evaluation [19]. The evaluation of mental abilities can be performed with standardized psychological tests or virtual technologies, as in the case of red light-green light reaction time [20]. The development and application of virtual environments open the possibility to create tools for the diagnosis, training, or treatment of some disorders. These virtual environments increment the similarities to the task and their scenarios, as could be the case of cognitive training for attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, or even the enhancement of cognitive performance [21\u201323]. The strength of the virtual environments arises from the \u201csense of presence\u201d experienced by the user [23], which gives the possibility of approaching near \u201creal-life behaviors\u201d inside a laboratory. Our aim in this work is to study the performance of post-COVID population in cognitive processes such as decision-making based on their visual sensitivity, visual attention, and information processing speed, with the hypothesis that the grade of severity of the COVID-19 infection is related to a reduction in performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose a single-evaluation comparative cross-sectional study applying Multiple Alternative Forced Choice (MAFC) and Simple Reaction Time tests designed under virtual environments. An Emotiv EPOC+ headset is used to verify the Focus, Interest, and Engagement performance during the MAFC task."

The local Research Committee and the Ethics Committee in Research from this healthcare institution revised and approved the research protocol of the study. The protocol was presented with the title \u201cNeurological comparison between healthy and post-COVID subjects using psychophysics experiments\u201d and was approved with registration number R-2021-1008-014. The present study fulfilled all requirements for observational studies based on the STROBE guidelines. The groups of participants consisted of insured patients from HGZ-4. The recruitment process began on 19 July 2021, was kept active during data collection, and concluded on 31 May 2022. The participants were grouped into three categories: one group of mildmoderate COVID patients (MM), one of several-critical patients (SC), and a control group (CT) of patients who were never diagnosed with COVID. In the case of COVID patients, their group assignment was defined based on the COVID-19 spectrums [24]. Once patients were selected, we invited them to attend a scheduled appointment where the study would be carried out under comfortable conditions, in a quiet room with\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1258 3 of 25\nadequate illumination. Before the study, all patients signed an informed consent form of participation. First, a clinician interviewed the patient to assess his or her medical history to confirm the assigned group category; then, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was carried out by a psychologist, to identify possible issues related to cognitive impairments. Finally, the patient was seated in a comfortable straight position in front of the computer\u2019s screen, for the Two-Forced Alternative Choice (2AFC) and Simple Reaction Time (SRT) tests [25], each one performed only once, and carried out under virtual environments. For the 2AFC test, a portable EEG headset was mounted on the patient to record the Focus, Interest, and Engagement signals. In principle, the tests are very simple, and it should not make any difference if the patient had previous knowledge of the use of computers before taking them. To further ensure that this would not bias the study, all participants were exposed to a sensibilization and training stage before the evaluation, consisting of a previsualization of the procedure. Once participants verbally expressed their familiarity and understanding of the mechanics of the tests, they continued with the evaluations, where they were required to maintain focus on the test."

Participants scoring lower than 24 in the MMSE, under mental state altering medication, suffering of color vision defects, or reporting a previous sleeplessness night, were excluded from the study. Individuals for the healthy control group were recruited directly at the HGZ-4. Here, the recruiter performed a first-screening process to verify that the candidates had not had a confirmed COVID diagnosis, not any type of chronic health condition, such as diabetes or hypertension. We chose the post-COVID patients from the HGZ-4 Epidemiology department\u2019s database. Subsequently, they were contacted by phone by a member of the hospital support staff, who gave each patient a detailed explanation of the aim of the study. Finally, if the patient decided to collaborate in the study, he or she was scheduled for an evaluation of their cognitive abilities at the health center."

The d\u2019 range is from 0 to 3.29, 0 for a participant with null efficiency with all responses wrong, and 3.29 for a participant that reaches perfection in the test [26,27]. For measuring Focus, Interest, and Engagement a range from 0 to 1 is used. Focus indicates the concentration or directed attention to a specific task, 0 indicates a non-concentration, and 1 indicates full concentration. Interest or Valence is defined as the aberrance to perform a task, and values near 1 represent the acceptance to perform the task. Engagement represents alertness and direct involvement in the task: values near 0 represent boredom, whereas values near 1 represent the perfect mixture of attention and concentration [28]. The SRT test is widely used to relate mental processes with physical responses, a measure of processing speed [25]. Our reaction time test measures the time between a visual stimulus is presented, in a virtual environment programmed, and the dominant foot response pushing a pedal.

Simple Reaction and Forced Choice Experiments For evaluating the cognitive abilities of the participants, a virtual environment (VE) of two tests, 2AFC and SRT, was designed, with scenarios related to activities performed while driving a vehicle.

A portable computer, processor Intel Core i79750H, 16GB of RAM, and a GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti were selected.

Our test presents a series of trials in which a car silhouette (target) is randomly placed either on the left or right road (two alternatives of choice) in a foggy environment (noise); an example of this is shown in Figure 1a.

Therefore, the participant\u2019s d\u2019 was obtained by computing the P(c) of he/she, using M = 2. To measure Focus, Interest, and Engagement in the 2AFC tests, a set of EEG signals was recorded and analyzed with an Emotiv EPOC+\u00ae headset. Melnik et al. found that the Emotiv EPOC+\u00ae can record EEG data during visual decision-making tasks with a comparable degree of confidence compared to research-grade EEG devices [31]. In addition, this portable EEG device has a simple setup for studies outside the laboratory. To record the EEG signals, the software EmotivPRO version 3.1.2.388 was used. Emotiv EPOC+\u00ae uses plated contact-sensors connected to felt pads fixed to plasticarms in an arrangement based on the 10\u201320 system. The sensors are placed on the locations: AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4, with two references at P3 and P4. This system also adds two alternative references at the left and right mastoids (M1 and M2 respectively). Each EEG channel has 14-bit resolution with 1 LSB of 0.51 \u00b5V. Sampling rate is configurable between 128 and 256 Hz [32,33]; here we used 128 Hz and the 5th order sinc notch filter at 50 Hz, achieving an effective bandwidth of 0.2\u201345 Hz. The Simple Reaction Time (SRT) test was programmed using a virtual environment synchronized with a foot pedal (800Z-GL3, Allen Bradley, Milwaukee, WI, USA), which simulates a braking action when a bicycle randomly appears in the scene.

Secondly, the EPOC+\u00ae was set up, assuring a good EEG signal quality for all channels with EmotivPRO software.

Results 3.1. Study Participation\nA total of 147 participants (51% males and 49% females) with a mean age of 38.7 years (SD = 11.3) completed the study. In total, 157 subjects attended the schedule; however, 10 did not qualify for eligibility due to being older than 64 years (n = 4), health problems such as high blood pressure or uncontrolled diabetes (n = 2), being misdiagnosed post-COVID (n = 1), or leaving the appointment (n = 3); another three participants were discarded at the end of the study because of their low MMSE score (see Figure 4). Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of participant groups, their mean score on the MMSE test, and the elapsed ti e since their recovery from COVID-19 infection (ToD). Among the 109 post-COVID participants, some reported sequelae in the respiratory system (n = 47), cardiovascular system (n = 8), neurological syste (n = 33), an other type of symptoms or discomforts (n = 50) including ageusia, anosmia, hair loss, fatigue, etcetera.\nThe t-test analysis between the Control and post-COVID group did not show a significant difference in age t(142) = \u22120.744 (p = 0.458). Once the post-COVID group was divided into Mild-Moderate and Severe-Critical groups, only the Severe-Critical group presented a significant difference in age versus the Control (t(76) = \u22122.666, p = 0.009) and\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1258 8 of 25\nMild-Moderate (t(104) = \u22123.635, p < 0.001) groups. A Bartlett\u2019s analysis confirmed that the groups had the same variance in their age distribution with a resulting Bartlett\u2019s statistic T(142) = 2.561 (p = 0.278). The years of education in our sample did not reach a significant difference between groups after an analysis with a Wilcoxon\u2019s test, where the comparisons were reported a Z = 0.296 (p = 0.767) for the CT-MM groups, Z = 0.599 (p = 0.549) for the MM-SC groups, and a Z = 0.799 (p = 0.424) for the CT-SC groups. A Levene\u2019s quadratic analysis also confirmed the same variance in years of education between the groups with a statistic W (2, 141) = 1.566 (p = 0.212). The 2AFC and SRT data were pre-processed for eliminating inconsistencies mentioned in the Quantitative Variables Section. Regarding repetitive choice patterns, the 2AFC test data from 86 participants (30 control; 56 post-COVID) were considered for analysis of phase 1, and data from 95 participants (26 control; 69 post-COVID) were used for phase 2. Regarding quality assessment for EEG signals, participants with lower than 80% signal of expected quality were discarded, and 99 participants were considered for the performance metrics analysis (31 control; 68 post-COVID). For the SRT test, participants with fortunate responses or missed targets in more than 80% were discarded and 134 participants (32 control; 103 post-COVID) were considered for the test analysis. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used to evaluate the normality of the data, finding that the Efficiency Index d\u2019 for both phases showed non-parametric distributions, and reaction times and values of the cognitive metrics had parametric distributions. Therefore, a Wilcoxon test (which works with non-parametric and parametric samples) was performed between the groups (control and post-COVID) as an independent variable; d\u2019, SRT times, and cognitive metrics (Focus, Interest, and Engagement) as dependent variables; significance value was defined at 0.05. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed between groups; d\u2019, SRT times were used as independent variables; age and ToD were used as dependent variables."

This means that subjects that presented respiratory and neurological sequelae are more likely to present a lower visual sensitivity in the test, where female participants have a lower sensitivity. In the case of the Severe-Critical group, it was found that there exists an influence by the variables Sex, Age, and Respiratory, Cardiovascular, and Neurological symptoms. From these variables, the 38.9% of variability for d\u2019 (F(5, 23) = 3.47, p = 0.009) is mainly explained by the Age (\u03b2 = \u22120.071, t(16) = \u22122.466, p = 0.022) and the interaction Age \u00d7 Neurological (\u03b2 = 0.101, t(16) = 2.585, p = 0.017), which manifests that the persistence of a neurological sequela influences the sensitivity of the participant as their age increases.

Based on this fact, it is expected that the participants present a decline over the d\u2019 as their age increases, which could be identified through a negative slope computed with linear regression. To illustrate this expected behavior, Figure 6 shows the results from the regression for each group, where the computed slopes resulted in negative values for the corresponding lines of each group (CT\u2019s R2 = 0.248; MM\u2019s R2 = 0.092; SC\u2019s R2 = 0.37).\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 26 Table 3.

From these variables, the 38.9% of variability for d\u2019 (F(5, 23) = 3.47, p = 0.009) is mainly explained by the Age (\u03b2 = \u22120.071, t(16) = \u22122.466, p = 0.022) and the interaction Age \u00d7 Neurological (\u03b2 = 0.101, t(16) = 2.585, p = 0.017), which manifests that the persistence of a neurological sequela influences the sensitivity of the participant as their age increases.

Based on this fact, it is expected that the participants present a decline over the d\u2019 as their age increases, which could be identified through a negative slope computed with linear regression. To illustrate this expected behavior, Figure 6 shows the results from the regression for each group, where the computed slopes resulted in negative values f r the corresponding lines of each group (CT\u2019s R2 = 0.248; MM\u2019s R2 = 0.092; SC\u2019s R2 = 0.37).\nTo evaluate if ToD affects d\u2019, a correlation analysis was performed.

Consequently, it might be possible to anticipate different levels of influence independently of the elapsed time from the patients\u2019 recovery in this study. The linear regression behavior for the MM group (R2 = 0.024) tends to be represented as a horizontal line rounding a high value of d\u2019 independent to ToD, as can be seen in Figure 7. In particular, the SC group regression was marked with a line of negative slope (R2 = 0.078), demonstrating that this group can even present lower values of d\u2019 after long ToD (see Figure 7).

Coefficients for both groups showed a non-significant correlation, and computed values were R = \u22120.226 (p = 0.287) and R = \u22120.219 (p = 0.229) for the MM and SC groups, respectively. Consequently, it might be possible to anticipate different levels of influence independently of the elapsed time from the patients\u2019 recovery in this study. The linear regression behavior for the MM group (R2 = 0.024) tends to be represented as a horizontal line rounding a high value of d\u2019 independent to ToD, as can be seen in Figure 7. In particular, the SC group regression was marked with a line of negative slope (R2 = 0.078), demonstrating that this group can even present lower values of d\u2019 after long ToD (see Figure 7).

The CT and MM adult groups showed a difference of Z = 2.299 (p = 0.022) with a medium effect size (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.77); the MM and SC adult groups showed a significant difference of Z = 2.658 (p = 0.008) with a large effect size (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.92); and the CT and SC adult groups reached a difference of Z = 3.746 (p = 0.00) represented by a very large effect size (Cohen\u2019s d = 1.99).\nFor phase 2, the d\u2019 of the CT group showed an interaction with both Age and Schooling variables, from which Age appears as the most significant predictor (\u03b2 = \u22120.077, t(23) = \u22127.210, p < 0.001), then, maintaining Schooling as a constant, the Age explains 68.7% of the variability for d\u2019 (adjusted R2 = 0.687, F(2, 23) = 28.4, p < 0.001). Like phase 1, this result matches with the expected reduction of the visual sensitivity derived from aging. Similarly, the Mild-Moderate post-COVID group presented an interaction between d\u2019 and Age but with a different predictor, in this case Sex. Still, for this group Age (\u03b2 = \u22120.069, t(39) = \u22123.726, p = 0.001) represents the most significant explanation for 33.8% of the variability (adjusted R2 = 0.338, F(2, 39) = 8.14, p < 0.001) for our dependent variable (d\u2019) too. Therefore, the visual sensitivity experienced by this post-COVID group decreases as the age of the subject increases, which shows an independence from the COVID sequelae. In particular, the Severe-Critical group manifested post-COVID symptoms as predictors for the efficiency index, i.e., respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological disorders. From these interactions, the Cardiovascular sequelae (\u03b2 = 0.441, t(20) = 2.397, p = 0.026) distinguishes individually; however, the presence of both Respiratory and Neurological symptoms, Respiratory \u00d7 Neurological (\u03b2 = \u22120.442, t(20) = \u22122.182, p = 0.041), explains 19.9% of the variability of d\u2019 (adjusted R2 = 0.199, F(3, 20) = 2.24, p = 0.09). Consequently, the visual sensitivity in decision-making processes is more likely to be related to sequelae produced by the COVID infection for this group. The coefficients of correlation are for the CT, R = \u22120.805 (p < 0.001), and for MM, R = \u22120.435 (p = 0.004). Here MM and CT groups showed a significant relationship between the participants\u2019 d\u2019 and their age, while the SC group did not reach such significance with a value of R = 0.021 (p = 0.919), maybe due to their cognitive damage and the poor d\u2019 reached by all SC participants. Same to 2AFC-P1, the linear regression analysis of participants shows that d\u2019 decreases when age increases for the CT R2 = 0.7, and for the MM R2 = 0.365, with negative slope values, for the SC group R2 = 0.002, remain almost constant (with low d\u2019). The linear regression for the participants\u2019 average d\u2019 versus age can be seen in Figure 10. The relationship between participants\u2019 average d\u2019 and ToD for 2AFC-P2 test has a correlation coefficient for MM group R = 0.028 (p = 0.859) and for SC group R = 0.153 (p = 0.457), indicating almost a null correlation. The linear regression of d\u2019 shows a very small increase as the ToD increases, this can be seen in Figure 11. Considering phase 1 of the 2AFC, the SC group represents a tendency of poor decision making among the post-COVID participants; however, the non-correlation between the value of d\u2019 and ToD casts doubt on this tendency as a representative lasting affectation of their cognitive process.\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1258 14 of 25\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 26 variability of d\u2019 (adjusted R2 = 0.199, F(3, 20) = 2.24, p = 0.09).

The 47.9% of variability for the reaction times for the Mild-Moderate group (adjusted R2 = 0.479, F(5, 55) = 6.98, p < 0.001) is explained by the interaction of the variables Sex, Age, Schooling and Respiratory and Neurological post-COVID disorders. From these predictors, Age is the most representative in the model with a coefficient \u03b2 = 8.74 (t(55) = 3.612, p = 0.001), which indicates that the reaction time of the participants increased approximately 8.74 ms for each one-year increment. The reaction times of the Severe-Critical group were found to interact with Sex and Neurological sequelae (Sex \u00d7 Neurological), whose coefficient \u03b2 = 100.05 (t(33) = 2.325, p = 0.026) is related to 20.4% of the variability of the dependent variable (adjusted R2 = 0.204, F(2, 33) = 4.07, p = 0.015). Following this, we can interpret that the females that reported any type of neurological sequela might present a slower reaction time, and therefore a lower information processing speed. Coupled with Welford, the reaction time tends to increase in function of aging [25]. Accordingly, the CT group demonstrates this expected behavior based on the resultant positive slope from linear regression, as can be seen in Figure 14. The coefficient of determination computed for this group was R2 = 0.099. Similarly, post-COVID groups showed positive slopes but with higher values. The coefficients of determination for these groups corresponded to R2 = 0.295 for the MM group and R2 = 0.087 for the SC group.

Based on our study, we confirmed our hypothesis that post-COVID patients who suffered a severe-critical infection showed a lower efficiency index in decision-making tasks demanding high sensitivity of the visual system in comparison to the Control group (Z = 3.143, p = 0.002), and the post-COVID participants who recovered from a mild-moderate infection, whose difference was Z = 2.717 (p = 0.007). The processing information speed, measured with the reaction time test, exposed that severe-critical post-COVID patients presented slower response times compared to never-infected subjects (Z = \u22123.652, p < 0.001) and mild-moderate post-COVID cases (Z = \u22122.767, p = 0.006). These results confirm our hypothesis that the resulting damage in skills was more severe in severe-critical patients than for the mild cases, compared to non-infected subjects.\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1258 21 of 25\nWe would like to emphasize that this kind of study became relevant after the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic and would not have been considered otherwise. Our proposal of a single evaluation study is the most direct approach for the estimation of the resulting deficiencies, and there is no initial reference to the cognitive performance of the participants since no prediction of the possible effects was available at the beginning of the pandemic. That is, the visual response effects were not detected at the beginning of the pandemic; furthermore, the first effects reported were the taste and olfactory losses, which emphasizes that, if any initial studies would have been carried out at the beginning of the pandemic, they would have pointed in that direction. However, the advantage of only doing this study after two years of disease spreading is that the obtained results are more stable now than they would have been during intermediary epochs of the pandemic: it is important to notice that visual deficiencies have become longer term effects than taste or olfactory loses, which in most cases were recovered after time periods which depended on the subjects\u2019 prior health conditions. Another variable which could be under consideration is the variety of (long-term) recovery times of each recruited participant, whose mean for subjects in this study was 8.70 months (SD = 5.04) for the mild-moderate cases, and 11.25 months (SD = 5.29) for severe-critical cases. We should consider, on the other hand, that a complete clinical analysis of the control participants was not evaluated, since their clinical history contemplated in the study was only based on a verbal interview. For example, we did not require any laboratory analysis to thoroughly verify the overall health of the patients, assuming this would not promote any risk of bias in the selection process. We should also mention that an unavoidable characteristic of the study is that the SevereCritical post-COVID group has a higher mean age than the Control and Mild-Moderate groups, an effect consistent with the predominant global behavior of the disease, where most severe cases were reported among adults with a mean age above 40 years [8,9,36]. Previous studies suggest that COVID-19 may be the cause for cognitive deficiencies [16], a premise derived from the discovery of disturbances in the nervous and visual systems [3,37], which directly relate to several cognitive processes. As a result of our study, it is evident that the participants of the Severe-Critical group performed more poorly than the Control and Mild-Moderate post-COVID groups. The reduced functioning of cognitive processes in severe-critical could be determined from the evaluated loss of sensitivity of the visual system to discriminate stimulus in poorly contrasted environments. As has been reported [38], patients with a severe infection of COVID-19 were likely to develop ocular complications, such as alterations in the optic nerve and the visual cortex, which would be reflected as acute vision loss or even visual impairment [4,13,14,39]. The most outstanding result of our evaluation procedure became evident when performing the 2AFC phase 2 test: during the initial phase 1, it was evident that the SC group performed poorly compared to the other two groups, but the differences among MM and CT could be interpreted as contradictory results, since our results showed that the MM group performed equally or even better than the CT group during the 2AFC first phase as indicated by the small effect size favoring the MM group (d = \u22120.47). However, in the second phase the expected lower performance differences were confirmed even between age subgroups of the three different cases. We believe that this could be related to the existence of an unreported or unknown condition in some participants of the control group, which is related to our restricted clinical history of these participants. Another possibility may arise from post-pandemic lock-down effects on their vision, as reported by other studies [12,40]. However, we do not consider this to be the case in our study, since the participants\u2019 working environments varied from home to office activities. We found that not only is the severity of the disease strongly related to the impairment of these cognitive processes, but there is also a persistent tendency among the older adult population to present this impairment independently of the severity of the disease. The cognitive metrics used in this study allowed us to analyze the visual attention in both phases of the 2AFC test. During phase 1, all groups performed the test with similar awareness, showing no significant differences among them with respect to the Focus, Interest,\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1258 22 of 25\nand Engagement variables. On the contrary, phase 2 was marked by a significant difference of the CT and MM groups compared to the SC group, in particular for the Focus metric with large effect sizes, indicative of the damage to the visual system, with participants not being able to find the test visual signal. This assessment is confirmed by different studies which have found EEG abnormalities as possible consequences of neuronal damage provoked by the COVID-19 infection, as evidence of invasion of the CNS and PNS by this virus has become apparent [11]. These abnormalities have not only been reported on frontal and central changes in the EEG at rest and during high cognitive loads [10,11], but also with brain changes reflecting and atrophy of the crus II for a cognitive decline [41] and a possible relation with the ACE receptor [17]. However, some other factors and even treatment procedures (e.g., the prolonged periods of ICU treatment with long-term sedation) are also known as contributors to the impaired functioning of the brain. The SRT test, which is widely used as a marker of the information processing speed and to study the general functioning of the CNS [25], showed that the SC group had the slowest reaction time among the groups, reflecting a lower functioning of the information processing speed. A relation of this cognitive process with COVID-19 was previously established for a risk estimator of death [18], and our study contributes extending this lower performance to severe-critical recovered patients. By considering the longest route available in the nervous system, going from the visual system to the CNS, and finalizing in a physical response by the foot, we might be able to uncover disturbances in the response of the motor system caused by neurological syndromes detonated by COVID-19 infection. These syndromes, mainly reported in hospitalized and severe-critical patients, include fibromyalgia, peripheral nerve damage, and critical myopathy [2,7,16]. In less severe cases, it has been reported that poorly organized movements are present in response to commands [6]. It was interesting to find that the adults recovering from a mild-moderate infection had similar reaction times to the Control group; meanwhile, the post-COVID middle-aged participants presented similar reaction times independently of the severity of the COVID-19 infection. This relation might uncover an influence of the age and the severity of the infection to hypothesize that adults preserve a good functioning of the information processing speed, while the severe-critical cases result in an amelioration of this ability which, on one hand, could be a consequence of the infection severity, e.g., as we report for the predictors sex and neurological sequelae, or on the other hand, the infection severity could be a consequence of a previous reduced functioning of the information processing speed, as found by Batty et al. [18]. The linear regressions of the 2AFC tests show a decreasing tendency of d\u2019 in its first phase, which was even more noticeable for the Severe-Critical group. In the case of the second phase, the post-COVID-19 groups maintained a quasi-constant d\u2019 independently of the elapsed time of being discharged; however, the Severe-Critical group kept a lower index than the Mild-Moderate group, which goes in line with the first phase of the test, recognizing a diminished visual sensitivity only in severe cases. In addition, it was found that d\u2019 was uncorrelated to the discharged period of the patients in both tests, thereby exposing an unclear tendency of the amelioration of decision-making based on visual sensitivity for post-COVID-19 patients. The SRT test also showed a small decreasing tendency in the regression of the relation between the reaction time and the elapsed time from the patient\u2019s discharge for the Severe-Critical group, while the Mild-Moderate group showed a tendency of a constant value on the regression. Contrary to the 2AFC, this decrease may indicate an improvement in the information processing speed of the patients as the reaction times are faster. However, the reaction time and the period of discharge were uncorrelated; thus, this apparent improvement cannot be asserted. Despite the simplicity of our study, we were able to evaluate the functioning of some cognitive processes such as the decision-making based on visual sensitivity, visual attention, and the information processing speed through forced choice and reaction times. Based on the evidence we found of disturbances in the selected cognitive processes, we find it interesting to extend this study of cognition in post-COVID patients to some other areas\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1258 23 of 25\nsuch as the memory, learning skills, executive functions, and other sensory-perceptual responses. This becomes relevant as these cognitive processes are strongly related to our daily tasks in different environments such as the home, the work, the school, or social areas, where a disfunction in cognition might represent a lower performance in our tasks and less awareness of our surroundings. The functioning of cognitive processes in recovered COVID-19 patients can be assessed using visual psychophysics evaluations to measure the decision-making based on visual sensitivity, visual attention, and information processing speed through choice and reaction times. We found that not only is the severity of the disease strongly related to the impairment of these cognitive processes, but also there is a relation of some respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological sequelae derived from the infection. A persistent tendency among the middle-aged population to present this impairment, independently of the severity of the disease, highlights the necessity of an adequate follow-up for these patients. Admittedly, as most of the authors agree, it would be relevant to offer an adequate follow-up, not only for this population, but for all patients recovering from COVID-19."

            "text": "We proposed a study with a set of psychophysics experiments to investigate if recovered patients from COVID-19 present a diminution on their skills related to decision-making based on visual sensitivity and processing information speed. We found that as result of the sequelae derived from the COVID-19 infection, in comparison to never infected individuals or patients recovered from a mild-moderate infection, patients recovering from a severecritical infection have a poorer performance in tasks requiring a high visual sensitivity to make a decision and a slower processing information speed, being both cases an effect of a damage either of the visual system or the nervous system. As mild-moderate cases were found to present a similar performance to never infected individuals in decision-making and processing information speed, it still concerning the prevalence of a cognitive deficit in the processing information speed, as it is present on 4 of 10 patients based on our analysis. The psychophysics experiment proposed to evaluate the decision-making process based on visual sensitivity, we used two different levels of fog density, i.e., two different visual sensitivity thresholds, to evaluate the performance of the recovered patients from COVID-19. The lesser fog density, or the less difficult level in the experiment, was easily solved by the never-infected and the mild-moderate cases, meanwhile patients with a severe-critical infection presented a lower performance. Similarly, these patients also had a poorer performance in the task presenting a higher value of fog density than both mildmoderate cases and never-infected individuals. Also, for this level the mild-moderate cases presented a barely lower performance than never-infected individuals, which allows us to believe that our testing tool might help to identify the severity of the infection suffered by the infected people. Finally, we find important to extend the study of the cognitive processes among the infected population with COVID-19, this because there exists other unexplored areas and processes such as the memory, learning skills, executive functions, and other sensoryperceptual responses. Above all, it is relevant to analyze the possibility of including a psychological follow-up for all the patients recovering from COVID-19 to prevent an identify cognitive impairments as these processes are very important in our daily life tasks.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.S.-M., C.V.-M. and J.A.P.-M.; methodology, L.M.C.-T.; software, M.S.-M., C.V.-M. and J.A.P.-M.; validation, J.A.P.-M.; formal analysis, M.S.-M., C.V.-M., J.J.M.-N., A.I.B.-G., J.A.P.-M. and M.G.B.-S.; investigation, M.S.-M., C.V.-M., L.M.C.-T. and J.A.P.-M.; resources, L.M.C.-T. and J.A.P.-M.; data curation, M.S.-M., C.V.-M., J.J.M.-N., A.I.B.-G., J.A.P.-M. and M.G.B.-S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.S.-M., C.V.-M. and J.A.P.-M.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.S.-M., C.V.-M., L.M.C.-T., J.J.M.-N., A.I.B.-G., J.A.P.-M. and M.G.B.-S.; supervision, J.A.P.-M.; project administration, J.A.P.-M.
