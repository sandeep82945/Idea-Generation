    "abstractText": "Utilizing colloidal probe, lateral force microscopy and simultaneous confocal microscopy, combined with finite element analysis, we investigate how a microparticle starts moving laterally on a soft, adhesive surface. We find that the surface can form a self-contacting crease at the leading front, which results from a buildup of compressive stress. Experimentally, creases are observed on substrates that exhibit either high or low adhesion when measured in the normal direction, motivating the use of simulations to consider the role of adhesion energy and interfacial strength. Our simulations illustrate that the interfacial strength plays a dominating role in the nucleation of a crease. After the crease forms, it progresses through the contact zone in a Schallamach wave-like fashion. Interestingly, our results suggest that this Schallamach wave-like motion is facilitated by free slip at the adhesive, self-contacting interface within the crease.",

            "text": "Creasing in microscale, soft static friction\nJustin D. Glover1,4, Xingwei Yang 2,4, Rong Long 2 & Jonathan T. Pham 1,3\nUtilizing colloidal probe, lateral force microscopy and simultaneous confocal microscopy, combined with finite element analysis, we investigate how a microparticle starts moving laterally on a soft, adhesive surface. We find that the surface can form a self-contacting crease at the leading front, which results from a buildup of compressive stress. Experimentally, creases are observed on substrates that exhibit either high or low adhesion when measured in the normal direction, motivating the use of simulations to consider the role of adhesion energy and interfacial strength. Our simulations illustrate that the interfacial strength plays a dominating role in the nucleation of a crease. After the crease forms, it progresses through the contact zone in a Schallamach wave-like fashion. Interestingly, our results suggest that this Schallamach wave-like motion is facilitated by free slip at the adhesive, self-contacting interface within the crease.\nUnderstanding static friction of soft materials is important for a range of applications, from bioinspired adhesives1\u20133 and car tires4 to damage of articular cartilage5. Although studies on friction started half a millennium ago by da Vinci6, fundamental challenges persist for soft adhesive interfaces7,8. In its most basic form, consider an elastomeric block attached to a spring, which is pulled on a rigid surface. The block remains stationary until the spring force overcomes a threshold, at which point the block moves relative to the surface; this static threshold is related to a number of parameters, like the contact area1,9\u201311. For macroscopic surfaces, the true contact area is related to microscale roughness9,12, where microscopic contact points at the interfaceoften control how the two surfaces interact9,13,14. However, for very soft materials that have a modulus of a few kPa, probed on microscopic scales, elastic forces approach those of capillarity and adhesion, leading to unique physics that are still not fully understood (e.g. elastocapillarity). This leads to a gap in our knowledge about how a single microscopic point, like a spherical microparticle, starts to move on a soft adhesive surface.\nIn studies of soft tribology and adhesion, a spherical probe is commonly used as a model geometry9,14\u201320. When a sphere is pulled laterally on an elastomer, adhesive interactions lead to the static friction threshold21. To overcome this threshold, Schallamach waves can emerge to enable relative motion. First reported in 1971, Schallamach waves describe a cascade of detachment and reattachment events that propagate through the contact zone22,23. These waves form when a\nbuckling event occurs at the front of the sphere, which then reattaches to the sphere and creates a pocket of air. This air gap then moves through the contact zone, like a ruck moving through a rug24, without significant interfacial slippage between the sphere and the substrate. This air gap can also vanish under the contact zone, allowing the sphere and surface to make new contact25. Schallamach waves are the most reported instance of surface buckling behavior in soft, tribological contacts; however, most experiments have focused on macroscale spheres23,26\u201331. As we will show here on the microscale, the ruck through a rug mechanism is no longer an air pocket, but a self-contacting, non-damaging crease.\nCreases are surface instabilities resulting from a state of compressive strain. When the surface of a material is compressed, for example through direct compression or constrained swelling, wrinkles and creases develop. Wrinkles are sinusoidal undulations, whereas creases are localized, self-contacting, fold-like geometries. These instabilities can create microscale surface features, which have been used to tune adhesion, pattern surfaces, and control biological cells32,33. While the onset, growth, and recovery of creases have been and still are under investigation, the focus has been on soft substrates under uniform compression34\u201336. On the other hand, soft friction can also generate compression near the contact zone, but in a localized, asymmetric manner. This generates a question of how creases form in a tribological setting and their potential coupling to friction.\nReceived: 2 March 2023\nAccepted: 17 April 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Department ofChemical andMaterials Engineering,University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY40506, USA. 2Department ofMechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309, USA. 3Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221, USA. 4These authors contributed equally: Justin D.

A selfcontacting crease forms at the front of the microparticle, demonstrating a link between tribology and creasing. Our experiments illustrate that crease formation occurs in situations of either low or high adhesion, measured normal to the surface. This motivates simulations to consider the role of adhesion energy versus interfacial strength in the emergence of creases. Simulations demonstrate that interfacial strength, i.e., the highest stress that can be sustained by the microparticle\u2013soft surface interface, is the governing factor to initiate creasing. For creases to grow and fully progress through the contact zone, as observed in our experiments, the self-contacting crease interface should be adhesive, while still allowing for slip. Hence, the conditions for crease formation and progression include (1) little to no slippage between the microsphere and the substrate and (2) sufficient normal adhesion but allowable slip within the crease itself\u2014that is, an adhesive yet self-slippery crease interface. Additionally, these creases re-open on the trailing edge without leaving a permanent scar, demonstrating a no-wear tribological situation."

            "text": "Experimental approach and initial observations For our experiments, we use a colloidal probe (microsphere) on an atomic forcemicroscope (AFM), combinedwith a high-precision stage, to apply lateral displacements and measure lateral forces on a soft, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer (Fig. 1a). To image the substrate, a confocal microscope with a piezo-driven objective is used for fast, in-situ imaging of x\u2013z cross-sections. For the PDMS substrate, Sylgard 184 ismixed at a 60:1 base:crosslinker ratio and spin-coated on a glass slide to a thickness of ~90 \u00b5m. Prior to spin-coating, a fluorescentmonomer is added that binds to the polymer network, enabling fluorescent imaging by confocal microscopy37\u201339. Upon curing, a crosslinked film is obtained with Young\u2019s modulus of ~4 kPa37,40,41. For the colloidal probe, an 8.5 \u00b5m radius (R) glass sphere is attached to an AFM cantilever.\nIn a typical experiment, the sphere is brought into contact with the surface to a desired depth, d, and held until a force plateau, which is between 15 and 45 s. The substrate is subsequently translated laterally at a pre-defined velocity, v, while simultaneously imaging the contact (Fig. 1a). To measure the lateral force, FL, a laser bounces off\nthe cantilever into a detector to quantify the cantilever deflection. As the PDMS is pulled laterally relative to the stationary sphere, the cantilever deflects and changes the laser position (Fig. 1a). To investigate the effect of indentation depth, the relative depth is controlled to a range of d=R ~ 0.03\u20130.9. The upper limit is chosen such that the substrate meniscus remains at or below the center of the sphere prior to translation, while the lower limit is set naturally by adhesion, which slightly pulls the sphere into the substrate. Since rate has been shown to affect friction behavior, three velocities are chosen over a few decades: v = 10, 1, and 0.1 \u00b5ms\u22121 18,42.\nUpon translation, our initial observations showed that a crease emerges in the PDMS substrate at the front of the microsphere (Fig. 1b). As the substrate continues to translate, a second crease can also form before the first crease is released on the trailing edge. Example confocal images of creases are shown in Fig. 1c\u2013e from different viewing directions, depicting a full picture of the 3D crease geometry. As illustrated in a bottom-view x\u2013y image (Fig. 1c), the crease extends outside the contact zone of the microsphere. A 3D bottom view (Fig. 1d) shows that the first crease stretches underneath the microsphere, while a second crease forms at the leading edge. 3D in this casemeans that an image stack is displayed, rather than a single 2D slice. A cross-sectional x\u2013z image through the microsphere centerline (Fig. 1e) clearly illustrates the crease geometry. A movie of the entire process of crease formation during translation is presented in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Movie 1), with snapshots of important events provided in Fig. 2a.\nIt is important to note that crease formation is related to the details of the substrate preparation methods. In the case of Fig. 1, the substrate is left in ambient, lit conditions for 4 days. However, when samples are tested directly after curing, creases are not observed. A movie of the non-creasing case is presented in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Movie 2), with snapshots of important events provided in Fig. 2b. Note that wewill use the term light-aging to describe the amount of time the free PDMS surface is left in lit conditions, prior to colloidal probe experiments. To confirm that lightaging is the reason for crease formation, we perform several control experiments to test small changes in Sylgard 184 mixing ratio (e.g. modulus), particle size, dwell times, sample thickness, and extended curing times (see Supplementary Note 1). This difference in crease behavior after light-aging may be the result of changes in crosslinking over time43, combined with UV exposure altering the surface44,45.\nFig. 1 | Experimental observations of a microparticle starting to be pulled laterally on a soft elastomer. a Schematic of the experimental setup showing the combined AFM cantilever and confocal microscope used to simultaneously image the contact and measure the lateral force. b Schematic of crease formation, also showing the experimental variables of depth, d, and radius, R. c A x\u2013y confocal\nimage of a microsphere (R=8:5 \u00b5m) with two creases; one crease is under and the other is in front of the microsphere. d 3D image of the same microsphere viewed from below.

Additionally, within our experimental capabilities, we find that the dye itself does not affect the crease formation or force behavior (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nTo quantitatively compare the lateral resistance of the two cases, we use freshly prepared samples and those aged for 4 days in lit ambient conditions. In Fig. 2c, an example lateral force (FL) versus lateral displacement curve is plotted for creasing (purple curve) and non-creasing (red curve) cases (d=R =0:4 and v = 1 \u00b5ms\u22121). With the benefit of simultaneous imaging, FL is correlated to confocal images to gain insight into the effect of creasing on the lateral force. The numbered spots in Fig. 2c correspond to the snapshots in Fig. 2a and b. For example, at spot 1 on Fig. 2c, the microsphere is in contact but at rest on the surface (Fig. 2a1 and b1). Upon translating the substrate for the creasing case, FL initially increases while the microparticle remains attached to the substrate. At spot 2, a crease emerges, leading to a small reduction in FL; this reduction in FL is afforded by increased compliance from the creased surface. Once the crease is in full selfcontact, FL continues to climb and approaches a peak at spot 3. At this point, the first crease is under the microparticle (Fig. 2a3). Upon translating beyond the peak lateral force (defined as Fpeak), the first crease detaches on the trailing edge (Fig. 2a4) and FL drops precipitously to spot 4, returning the surface to an uncreased state (Fig. 2a5). For the non-creasing case, FL initially increases, like for the creasing case. However, a clear difference is observed between the creasing andnon-creasing forceplots. At spot 2 (Fig. 2b2), the height of the PDMScontact line at the back of themicroparticle lowers, while no change is evident at the front. After reaching Fpeak, the force is in an approximate plateau region and the most obvious change in deformation geometry is the lower meniscus height at the trailing edge. Some minor stick-slip is observed (Supplementary Movie 2), which relates to fluctuations in FL.\nAs demonstrated by Fig. 2c, Fpeak is significantly higher for creasing compared to the non-creasing case. To consider whether different testing parameters play a role, Fpeak is plotted as a function of d=R and v for both cases (Fig. 2d). In general, increasing both d/R and v\nincrease Fpeak within each case of creasing or non-creasing. The increase in Fpeak from v is likely associated with viscoelastic effects in the substrate46, while the increase from d/R is likely due to the increase in contact area. By looking at a single v to compare the two cases (e.g. yellow open vs. yellow closed points at 10 \u00b5ms\u22121), we find that Fpeak is higher for creasing cases compared to the non-creasing cases. On the other hand, the observation of creasing versus non-creasing between the two types of samples (i.e., aged in ambient light vs freshly prepared) is consistent across two decades of velocities. This implies that the formation of creases is itself not rate-dependent, although the rate can affect the measured forces. These unique experimental observationsmotivate the following questions: (1)What governs the formation of creases? Because the experiments presented in Fig. 2 exhibit higher Fpeak for creasing samples, it is intuitive to assume that there is an increase in substrate-particle adhesion with light aging, which leads to the formationof creases. (2)Howdoes the creaseprogress through the contact zone and release? Unlike the air pocket in Schallamach waves, the creases observed in our experiments exhibit self-contact and it is intriguing to ask whether the ruck through a rug mechanism is still applicable to a self-contacting crease.\nInterfacial strength governs crease formation With our hypothesis that higher substrate-particle interaction leads to the initial formation of creases, we set out to test this prediction experimentally. One way to increase the adhesion of PDMS to glass is by short-durationUV\u2013ozone treatment (UVO), whichwe anticipated to be easier to control than ambient light-aging47. Therefore, freshly prepared PDMS samples are UVO-treated from 0 to 40 s; this range is expected to have a surface modification depth of the order ~1 nm44, as opposed to longer UVO treatments (~10min or more) that create a thicker glassy layer48. Upon lateral testing at d=R=0:1 and v = 1\u03bcm s\u22121, samples treated for 10 s or less show no creases (Fig. 3a). For samples treated for 20 s or more, creases appear and increase in size with increasing exposure. Crease size is defined here as the length of the self-contacting crease before it is pulled underneath the microsphere, prior to any crease distortion. To compare UVO-treated surfaces with light-aged surfaces, we conducted the same set of experiments but\nFig. 2 | Creasing and non-creasing cases and the corresponding lateral forces. a Confocal x\u2013z images of a creasing sample moving at v = 1 \u00b5ms\u22121 with d=R=0.4. a1 The microsphere is in contact with the surface prior to the start of motion. a2 Formationof afirst crease.a3Themoment before thefirst crease is about to release on the trailing edge. a4 First image frame after the first crease releases and the force drops. a5 Second frame after the first crease releases, showing an uncreased state. b Confocal x\u2013z images of a non-creasing sample moving at v = 1 \u00b5ms\u22121 with\nd=R=0.4. b1 The microsphere in contact with the surface prior to the start of motion. b2 The contact shape is about midway to the peak lateral force (Fpeak). b3 The contact shape once the lateral force FL has reached an approximate force plateau. c Lateral force (FL) vs lateral displacement curves for creasing and noncreasing samples.

Scale bars: 20 \u03bcm.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2362 3\nwith aging in ambient light conditions over the course of 1\u20134 days. Creases appear on light-aged samples after 1 day and continue to grow in size for up to 4 days (Fig. 3b) (recall the data in Fig. 2 is light-aged for 4 days). The creasing behavior in the UVO and light-aged surfaces are similar, with creases that grow with increasing exposure. For comparison, a crease after 40 s of UVO treatment (Fig. 3c) appears nearly identical to a crease after 3 days of light-aging (Fig. 3d). In addition, increasing exposure time in both cases initially increases Fpeak; however, a dip occurs once the crease size reaches ~4\u03bcm(i.e. 30 sUVO and 3-day light aging). This non-monotonic behavior suggests an intricate coupling between crease initiation and lateral force: Although nucleation of creases requires a high lateral force, further growth of the creases can lower Fpeak.\nSince creases occur on both UVO and light-aged samples, we sought to confirm an increase in adhesion for both cases. Normal indentation andpull-off tests are employedwith the samemicrosphere (Fig. 3e). The pull-off forces measured from these tests can serve as a general metric for comparing the adhesion between the microsphere and the UVO or light-aged substrates. Unfortunately, the freshly prepared samples and UVO-treated samples display a pull-off distance beyond the 15 \u03bcm vertical limits of our AFM. However, the force\u2013height data are at least consistent with the expectation of increasing normal adhesion. Surprisingly however, the pull-off force and the work of separation (area under the curve) decrease with increased aging for the light-aged samples (Fig. 3f). The different roles of adhesion for the UVO and light-aged samples, despite the similar crease morphology, signals that the picture of adhesion being a generic factor controlling the nucleation of creases is too simplistic.\nCreasing is by nature an instability of substrate deformation triggered by a critical compressive strain49. Although in our experiments the substrate was not subjected to any global compression, the microsphere generates local compression in the substrate ahead of its leading front. Since the nucleation of creases does not involve a characteristic length scale34, we hypothesize that creases nucleate in the local compressive region when the maximum compressive strain reaches a critical value. To demonstrate, we use finite element analysis (FEA) (Supplementary Notes 2 and 3) to qualitatively simulate the contact between the microsphere and substrate. Motivated by the observation that the formation of creases is rateindependent (Fig. 2d), here we model the substrate as an elastic neoHookean solid and themicrosphere as a rigid body. Finite strain within the substrate is consideredwhich is necessary for simulating the highly localized large deformation around a crease. The microspheresubstrate adhesion is represented by a cohesive zone model featuring a bilinear function relating themagnitude of the attractive traction \u03c3 resisting separation to the relative separation \u03b4 between two points initially in contact (Fig. 4a). Such bilinear cohesive zone model has been extensively applied to simulate adhesion50,51 and recently to study Schallamach waves52. It can be viewed as an approximation of the attractive portion of the van der Waals interaction between two surfaces. The area underneath the triangle defined by \u03c3\u00f0\u03b4\u00de (Fig. 4b) represents the mechanical work required to separate a unit area of contacting interface, also known as the adhesion energy Wad. This parameter is directly related to the adhesion force in various mechanical tests (e.g., indentation or peel tests), and hence is often used as the metric to quantify adhesion. Apart fromWad, the cohesive zone model also includes additional parameters, i.e., the maximum traction \u03c3max and the final separation \u03b4f. In particular, \u03c3max represents the highest stress that can be sustained by the adhesive interface and will be referred to as the interfacial strength hereafter.\nFig. 3 | Peak lateral force, crease size, and normal adhesion with surface treatments. a Crease size and Fpeak as a function of increasing UV ozone time. b Crease size and Fpeak as a function of increasing time in ambient light conditions. c A crease on a 40 s UVO-treated surface. d A crease on a 3-day light-aged surface. eVertical adhesion force vs. height curves of a surface exposed toUVO for different\ntimes.

Scale bars: 20 \u03bcm.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2362 4\nWe use the FEA model to examine which cohesive zone parameter controls the nucleation of creases. Given that Wad = \u03c3max \u03b4f/2, we can independently vary Wad and \u03c3max as long as \u03b4f can shift accordingly. Specifically, we either hold \u03b4f constant so that Wad is proportional to \u03c3max, or increase \u03c3max while holding Wad constant, where \u03b4f decreases accordingly. The rest of the cohesive zone parameters, specifically the initial slope K, are held constant. The result in Fig. 4c shows that the onset of creasing is governed by \u03c3max and insensitive to Wad. This is not surprising since the maximum compressive strain in the substrate should scale with the tangential traction within the contact region, which is governed by \u03c3max rather than Wad. In Fig. 4d, we plot the maximum compressive strain in the substrate versus the prescribed \u03c3max under either fixed or varying Wad. Note that themaximum compressive strain refers to the normal strain component along the horizontal direction and is extracted as the highest compressive value observed spatially and temporally in a simulation (Supplementary Note 4). As expected, the relation between maximum compressive strain and \u03c3max is not affected by Wad. More interestingly, we observe three regimes as \u03c3max is increased (Fig. 4d, e). When \u03c3max is small (i.e., Regime i), the compressive strain is insufficient to trigger crease nucleation and the entire interface undergoes slip. When \u03c3max is large (i.e., Regime iii), the interface remains adhered and a crease is nucleated at the front of the microsphere. Creasing caps the maximum compressive strain at ~40%, regardless of how large is \u03c3max. This level of maximum compressive strain is close to the critical creasing strain (~35%) for a thick substrate under global uniaxial compression49. Between the two limiting regimes there is an intermediate one (Regime ii) where a crease nucleates, but partial slip occurs in a small region next to the crease. The FEA results support our hypothesis that crease nucleation is modulated by the local compressive strain in the substrate, which is further governed by the interfacial strength. This finding helps resolve the seeming paradox observed in Fig. 3, since the pulloff force during a normal indentation test seems to be connected with Wad rather than \u03c3max53. FEA simulations also reveal themechanismof how a creasemoves across the contact region (Fig. 4f). After nucleation, the crease first grows as the lateral displacement of the microsphere continuously increases. Unlike symmetric creases formed under global compression, in our simulations the crease tilts toward the trailing edge of the microsphere due to the asymmetric local compression; this is consistent with experimental observation (Fig. 2a3). Such asymmetry results in a Schallamach-wave-like motion of the crease: Its left edge is peeled from the microsphere while its right edge makes contact with the microsphere, as demonstrated by the relative position of the crease and a material point highlighted in Fig. 4f. This mechanism enables the crease to progress through the contact zone while maintaining the adhesive interface between microsphere and substrate, thereby avoiding a catastrophic drop of lateral force. Indeed, our experiments show that the lateral force continues to rise during crease motion and drops only after the crease moves out of the contact region (Fig. 2c).\nFig. 4 | FEA simulations of crease nucleation and progression. a Schematic illustration of the contact between the rigid microsphere and the substrate (left). The inset on the right shows a zoomed-in view of the interface in its initial state when contact is just established, and the separated state where the two surfaces are relatively displaced and thus a traction \u03c3 and separation \u03b4 are used to define the interfacial adhesion. \u03b4n and \u03b4t are the normal and tangential separations, respectively. b A cohesive zone model with bilinear traction-separation law is used to define the adhesion energy W ad on the interface. c Phase diagram for creasing in\nterms of the adhesion energy W ad and interfacial strength \u03c3max.

The purple dot represents a material point on the substrate surface.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2362 5\nHow self-adhesion inside the crease relates to progression and release Self-adhesion between the two contacting surfaces within a crease is evident in our experimental system. As shown in Fig. 2a4, a segment of the crease is retained even after itmoves out of the trailing edge. Given that the substrate is under tension at the trailing edge of the microsphere, theremust be self-adhesionwithin the crease to resist opening under tension. This motivates a unique question: How does selfadhesion affect the Schallamach wave-like motion of a crease? A conventional Schallamach wave features an air pocket for which selfadhesion is irrelevant. In the literature on creasing, it has been recently discovered that self-adhesion can resist the full recovery of a symmetric crease when the global compression is removed, leaving a scar on the substrate35. However, the Schallamach wave-like motion of an asymmetric crease involves more complex deformation in the substrate than the unfolding of a symmetric crease. Since self-adhesion is not included in the FEA model used for Fig. 4, we use FEA simulations to obtain physical insights into the role of self-adhesion (Supplementary Note 5). Here we apply a visco-hyperelastic model calibrated by rheological data to the substrate (Supplementary Note 2) since viscoelasticity may affect the crease motion, as indicated by the ratedependent peak lateral forces in Fig. 2d.\nSimulation results for three cases with different self-adhesion conditions are shown in Fig. 5a\u2013c. Although the case with no selfadhesion (Fig. 5a) can capture Schallmach wave-like crease motion, discrepancy arises as the crease approaches the trailing edge of the microsphere. Instead of remaining in contact as observed in experiments, the crease opens up due to the local tensile region near the\ntrailing edge. This is consistent with the expectation that a crease cannot remain foldedunder tension if adhesion is absent. In the second case (Fig. 5b), we implement identical self-adhesion interactions along both normal and tangential directions within the crease interface. As a result, the self-adhesion not only prevents the crease fromopening but also resists relative slippage along the crease, and hence is referred to as the sticky self-adhesion. Interestingly, the sticky self-adhesion completely suppresses the Schallamach wave-like motion. Instead, for the crease to progress through the contact zone, the entire adhesive interface behind the initial crease must debond, as demonstrated by the relative positions of two highlighted material points in Fig. 5b. Physically, for the Schallamach wave-like crease motion to be possible, material points on the two sides of a crease must move in the opposite direction (see Fig. 5a), which inevitably leads to slippage along the crease. This finding motivates us to pursue the third case (Fig. 5c), referred to as the slippery self-adhesion. In this case, self-adhesion is set primarily along the normal direction of the crease and much reduced along the tangential direction, such that the crease surfaces are under adhesive yet slippery contact. In this case, the crease undergoes a Schallamachwave-likemotionwhile growing in size and remains closed when it reaches the trailing edge, which is most consistent with our experiments (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 6). In addition to the crease formation, the experimental force trends in Fig. 2 are qualitatively captured by the simulations (Supplementary Note 6)."

For PDMS materials, slip can be defined locally on the molecular scale, which has been demonstrated using both polymer melts and elastomers;55 this is consistent with the idea that self-slip occurs in our very soft elastomer within the microscale crease. In addition, Newby et al. demonstrated that normal adhesion and slippage can be separately controlled by the surface energy and mobility of self-assembled monolayers, respectively56. Moreover, similar concepts of slip near soft peeling fronts have been observed57. We acknowledge that it is difficult to quantify the self-adhesion and selfslip within our creases, which should require careful characterization in future efforts. Consequently, quantitative agreement between simulations and experiments is not pursued due to challenges in obtaining calibrated adhesion parameters. Yet, our simulation results of the FEA with slippery self-adhesion are qualitatively consistent with the main experimental observations. As a demonstration, we plot the peak lateral force and crease size versus the interfacial strength \u03c3max between the microsphere and substrate under either increasing adhesion energy Wad (Fig. 5d) or fixed Wad (Fig. 5e). Assuming both UVO treatment and light-aging in Fig. 3 increase \u03c3max but affectW ad differently, the trends of simulation results in Fig. 5d, e are similar to as those in Fig. 3a, b. In particular, the non-monotonic dependence of peak lateral force on crease size in Fig. 3a, b is captured by the simulations.\nThe creases in our study are reminiscent of both surface creases found during symmetric global compression as well as Schallamach waves observed in macroscale, rubber tribology. Therefore, it is instructive to consider the similarities and distinctions of our creases to these phenomena. Self-contacting surface creases occur when a global compression is applied to a surface; for example, creases arise when attaching a soft layer to a pre-strained surface and releasing36, or simply applying a compressive strain on a soft block58,59. Crease nucleation hasbeen calculated to be similar to afirst-order transition59, and also sensitive to local imperfections on the surface60. Although confocal microscopy images of creases in the literature resemble our creases35, they have a different curvature at the surface. Moreover, near the elastocapillary length, defined as a ratioof surface tension and elastic modulus, LEC = \u03b3/E, creases can leave scars after removal of strain due to capillarity and self-adhesion. In our case, LEC\u2248 4\u03bcm, assuming \u03b3 = 20mNm\u22121 and E = 5 kPa. Yet no scars are observed once the self-contacting creasemoves through the contact zone. The lack of scaring may be due to low adhesion hysteresis but, more likely, is due to the state of tension at the trailing edge that pulls the crease open. However, it is interesting to note that the dip in Fpeak (Fig. 3) occurs when the crease size is near LEC, which may suggest a size-dependent force dip. Our creases are similar to Schallamach waves, where a surface instability manifests from a build-up of compressive stress at the front, which then passes through the contact zone61. In contrast to conventional Schallamach waves, however, our creases are selfcontacting such that no air gap is visible. The crease maintains a selfcontacting profile until it reaches the trailing edge and opens from the local tension. Additionally, the creasegeometry is relatively stable until it is near the trailing edge; we can stop the microsphere for several minutes without the crease moving (Fig. 2c\u2013e). Hence, the creases discovered here bridge the physical mechanisms of creases formed from global compression and Schallamach waves.\nFrom an experimental standpoint, the small size of our microsphere facilities using confocal microscopy to observe a single crease moving through the contact. For larger size scales, it would be challenging to see both sides of the sphere. Moreover, it would be difficult to control the contact size. For example, if a large glass sphere is brought into contact, the soft surface would deform to increase the contact area to much larger than LEC. Additionally, our investigation reveals the significance of silicone processing/aging on the interfacial mechanics of soft contacts. Changes in mechanical and surface\nproperties have been observed over aging time43, with different curing processes62, and with UV or UVO exposure44. In addition, soft materials, like lightly crosslinked PDMS, often have uncrosslinked free chains that are not tethered to the polymer network. We previously found that the PDMS used here (60:1 Sylgard 184) contains nearly 60% extractable materials41. These mobile molecules have been shown to form a liquid meniscus at the contact line of a stationary drop or microparticle38,40,63. In our case of a moving microparticle, the free chains are expected to reduce \u03c3max by acting as a partial lubricant, lowering but not eliminating the network\u2013particle contact37,55,64\u201367. At the same time, free chains can aid inmaintaining high normal adhesion due to capillarity;68 we associate this case with freshly prepared, untreated surfaces. However, minor stick\u2013slip behavior may result from a mixed contact interface, where the particle is partially in contact with the network and partially in contact with free chains (free mobile molecules) or dangling ends, which may also be the case for hydrogels7,37,65,69\u201371. After ambient light-aging (Fig. 2a), a line of increased fluorescence is observed at the surface. We also notice that the fluorescent signal of our fluorescent monomer increases after crosslinking into the network (Supplementary Note 7, Supplementary\nFig. 7). Therefore, the increased fluorescence may suggest some additional crosslinking at the surface. This idea is not completely new; for example, UV light has been suggested to create smoother surfaces with increased crosslinking at the surface44,45. Higher radiation has also been reported to lead to crosslinking and scission but with predominant crosslinking72. This crosslinkingwould reduce the amount of uncrosslinked free chains and dangling free ends near the surface that could partially lubricate the contact. Although this crosslinking may lead to amarginal increase inmodulus at the surface, a stiff layer is not required for creasing73.We confirmed this by running a simulationwith a stiff layer, which illustrates that a higher interfacial strength is required to crease with an increasingly stiff layer (Supplementary Note 7, Supplementary Fig. 8).\nIn summary, we introduce a unique approach to experimentally investigate how a microscopic contact starts to move laterally on a soft, adhesive surface. Using lateral force and confocalmicroscopy, we show that both creasing and non-creasing cases can occur. Creasing emerges with sufficiently high interfacial strength between the particle and the surface, whichmanifests experimentally through light-agingor UVO exposure. By tuning the parameters that govern adhesion energy in simulations, we conclude that the interfacial strength plays a dominating role in crease formation. Most interestingly, a crease moves through the contact zone in a Schallamach wave-like manner, fully opening only on the trailing edge due to local tension. This requires that the self-contacting interface within a crease is adhesive yet slippery. Future efforts should consider experiments that are able to tune self-adhesion vs. self\u2013slip interfaces independently, potentially through molecular architectures, compositions, or multi-phase materials."

            "text": "Imaging via confocal microscopy. Images were taken of the fluorescein diacrylate dyed samples using an inverted Leica confocal microscope equipped with a piezo objective holder that allows for fast cross-sectional scans and a \u00d740 air objective. A correction ring on the objective enabled focusing on the air-PDMS interface through the thickness of the PDMS sample. To take x\u2013z images, the piezo was used to capture a single slice through the x\u2013z plane. For the full 3D image in Fig. 1e, theprobewas stopped, such that a full 3D scan canbe captured. However, most images were taken as a single x\u2013z slice to increase frame rates and used for analysis. Variable imaging rates and resolutions were used to optimize the imaging rate and quality. An excitation laser with a wavelength of 488 nm and a collection range of 495\u2013520nm was consistently used. Note that the laser power was left constant when comparing the fluorescence signal before and after crosslinking.\nImage analysis. The confocal images were analyzed using ImageJ. A sphere was fit to the shape of the colloidal probe in the image to determine the location. To record the indentation depth, the distance from the lowestpoint of the sphere to the PDMSsurface far outside the contact zone was measured, while the particle was at rest.\nForce microscopy. A JPK Nanowizard 4 was mounted on top of the confocalmicroscope. A colloidal probeAFMcantilever was used for all measurements. A ~ 17 \u00b5m diameter glass sphere was attached to a thermal noise-calibrated ACL-TL tipless cantilever having a nominal spring constant of ~40Nm\u22121 using high-strength epoxy. For lateral force tests, the microsphere was indented into the PDMS at a rate of 1 \u00b5ms\u22121 and held for up to 45 s. Toconduct lateral forcemeasurements, a motorized, high-precision linear stage (Physik Instrumente, L-509), mounted to the side of the confocal microscope, was connected to a custom sample holder between the AFM head and the confocal microscope. This setup enables lateral translation of the sample via the motorized linear stage, while the confocal microscope objective and the colloidal probe of the AFM remain aligned and in focus. Prior to these experiments, lateral force calibration of the cantilever was performed by scanning the tip across a clean glass slide at different normal loads. Based on a procedure in the literature, we assumed a coefficient of friction of 0.4 and calculated the frictional force relative to the cantilever deflection74. For normal adhesion tests, the microspherewas indented into the surface at a rate of 0.1 \u00b5ms\u22121 to a depth of ~0.2 \u00b5m, followed by retraction at the same rate. To test if creasing behavior is affected by the dye itself, we conducted experiments without dye but in reflection mode on the confocal microscope. Although this imaging is not suitable to measure details, fold release can still be observed (Supplementary Movies 3 and 4)."

            "text": "Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to simulate the microscale indentation and sliding experiments using the commercial package ABAQUS (version 2020, Simulia, Providence, RI, USA). The FEA model consisted of two components: a rigid sphere and a soft substrate. To reduce the computational cost, a two-dimensional (2D) plane strain model was built where the spherical microsphere was\nmodeled as a rigid circle with a diameter of 17 \u00b5m, and the substrate was a 200 \u00b5m\u00d750 \u00b5m rectangle meshed with 2D plane strain elements (CPE4RH). The substrate was subjected to a fixed boundary condition at its bottom surface and traction-free boundary conditions at its left, right and top surfaces. In addition, the top surface of the substrate can form adhesive contact with themicrosphere. The contact between the microsphere and the substrate was modeled as hard contact and was implemented through the direct method that strictly enforces the pressure-overclosure relationship of hard contact. This contact formulation generates a compressive contact pressure on the interface between the microsphere and the substrate, which should be distinguished from the attractive adhesion prescribed by the cohesive zone model described next. Cohesive zone modeling with the bilinear traction-separation lawwas adopted to describe adhesionbetween the microsphere and the substrate aswell as self-adhesion of the substrate surface. Reversible cohesive zones were implemented to allow reestablishment of adhesion after complete separation. More information on thematerialmodel, cohesive zone, andmesh convergence test is provided in Supplementary Note 2. Initially, themicrosphere was on top of the substrate surface with a 1 \u00b5m gap between the microsphere and the substrate surface. In a simulation, the microsphere was first moved downwards at a velocity of 1 \u00b5ms\u22121 until a desired indentation depth was achieved. After a 17-second relaxation step (to account for the experimental time gap between normal indentation and lateral motion), the microsphere was moved horizontally with the indentation depth heldfixed. All simulationswere performedusing a dynamic/ implicit solver to accommodate the instability associated with creasing. Since physically the 2D plane strain model represents the crosssection of an infinitely long cylinder in contact with the substrate, the lateral force obtained from the simulations is a line force, i.e., force per unit length along the out-of-plane direction."
