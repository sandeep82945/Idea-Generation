Exploration of Additional Derivatives and Analogs: The paper highlighted the effectiveness of the G2 compound among the curcumin derivatives G1â€“G7. Future research could focus on synthesizing and evaluating additional derivatives and analogs of curcumin that maintain the core beneficial properties of G2 while potentially offering improved pharmacokinetics, increased stability, or enhanced efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other cancers.

Mechanistic Studies of G2 and Other Promising Derivatives: Although the study indicated that G2 inhibits cell migration and induces apoptosis by affecting the phosphorylation of AKT and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, more detailed mechanistic studies could be valuable. These studies would aim to fully elucidate the pathways through which G2 and other promising derivatives exert their anticancer effects, including the investigation of their interaction with other potential molecular targets involved in cancer progression.

Combination Therapy Studies: Investigating the effects of combining G2 or other effective curcumin derivatives with existing chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapies could be a fruitful area of research. These studies would assess whether such combinations could produce synergistic effects, potentially leading to more effective treatment strategies for HCC and reducing the dosage required for each agent, thereby minimizing side effects.

Development and Evaluation of Drug Delivery Systems: Given the challenges related to the bioavailability and metabolic stability of curcumin derivatives, research into novel drug delivery systems (such as nanoparticles, liposomes, or polymer-based delivery systems) could enhance the delivery and efficacy of G2 and similar compounds. Such systems could target HCC more specifically, increase drug stability, and improve patient outcomes.

Clinical Trials and Toxicity Studies: Before any new compound can be considered for clinical use, comprehensive toxicity studies and clinical trials are necessary to assess its safety, efficacy, and dosing in humans. Given the promising results of G2 in vitro and in animal models, moving forward with these studies would be critical. Additionally, exploring the compound's effects on different types of liver cancer, as well as its potential applicability to other cancers, could broaden its therapeutic potential.
