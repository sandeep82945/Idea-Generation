    "abstractText": "The exclusive production of pion pairs in the process pp \u2192 pp\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 has been measured at \u221as = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, using 80\u03bcb\u22121 of low-luminosity data. The pion pairs were detected in the ATLAS central detector while outgoing protons were measured in the forward ATLAS ALFA detector system. This represents the first use of proton tagging to measure an exclusive hadronic final state at the LHC. A cross-section measurement is performed in two kinematic regions defined by the proton momenta, the pion rapidities and transverse momenta, and the pion\u2013pion invariant mass. Cross-section values of 4.8 \u00b1 1.0 (stat) +0.3 \u22120.2 (syst) \u03bcb and 9 \u00b1 6 (stat) +2 \u22122 (syst) \u03bcb are obtained in the two regions; they are compared with theoretical models and provide a demonstration of the feasibility of measurements of this type.",

            "text": "A significant fraction of LHC proton\u2013proton (pp) collisions are either elastic (\u2248 25%) or diffractive (\u2248 20% of the remaining inelastic collisions [1]). In many of these collisions the momentum transferred from the beam protons is too small (< 1 GeV) for perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to be applicable, and instead Regge theory [2,3] is used. This involves the exchange of a nonperturbative Pomeron, a soft colour-singlet object originally introduced to keep the universality of the s-dependence of high energy total cross sections by Gribov [4], Chew and Frautschi [5] and later providing an explanation of the rise of hadronic collision cross-sections with increasing beam energy energy [6]. Since QCD is assumed to be universally valid, there should nevertheless be a \u2018mapping\u2019 between Regge theory and QCD in which the exchanged Pomeron is equivalent to the exchange of quarks and gluons, the fundamental quanta of QCD. In certain kinematic regions, the Pomeron can be treated approximately as a two-gluon coloursinglet state. Exclusive diffractive processes provide a clean environment to study the interactions of Pomerons, via the observation of final states involving only several hadrons and no beam-remnants except the outgoing protons.\nThis paper presents first measurements of the exclusive double-diffractive production of charged-pion pairs in the process pp \u2192 pp\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, schematically shown in Fig. 1, using the ATLAS detector at the LHC.\nThe charged pions are measured with the ATLAS inner detector [7], while the outgoing protons are measured by the ALFA detector [8], comprising two tracking stations situated in the forward regions on either side of ATLAS at distances of approximately 240 m from the ATLAS interaction point (IP). The ALFA detector system was designed in the first place to determine the total pp cross section at LHC energies, as well as to measure the LHC luminosity via smallangle proton-scattering processes [9]. The use of the ALFA detectors is a distinctive feature of the present study, since the outgoing protons are directly measured, suppressing con-\n(e.g. the Pomeron) and must have all hadronic quantum numbers equal to zero. Two of the simplest examples of possible production mechanisms are shown in the bubble (right) \u2013 the upper one belonging to so-called continuum contributions and the lower one to resonance contributions\ntamination from the remnants of excited scattered protons. The analysis benefits from procedures developed previously in the ALFA total cross section measurement [9].\nThe present results can be compared with existing measurements of the exclusive production of pion pairs using data from the ISR [10,11], SPS [12], RHIC [13] and LHC [14,15], where the CMS results [14,15] are not based on purely exclusive events but on a mixture of exclusive and semi-exclusive processes. Some recent theory predictions for the process considered here may be found in Refs. [16\u201326]. In addition to revealing general properties of Pomerons, these channels provide a rich potential harvest for a variety of final states, including the production of resonances and the possible production of the long-sought glueball states."

The x-axis points from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of R \u2261 \u221a( \u03b7)2 + ( \u03c6)2.\ninner detector, the minimum-bias trigger scintillators, and the ALFA detector system.\nThe ATLAS inner detector (ID) [7,27] immediately surrounds the ATLAS IP and is composed of three tracker subsystems that provide high-precision track reconstruction: a silicon pixel detector (innermost), a silicon semiconductor tracker (SCT), and a transition-radiation tracker (outermost), which also helps to discriminate electrons from hadrons. The ID covers a range of |\u03b7| < 2.5. It is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid, which produces a 2 T axial field within the ID volume.\nThe minimum-bias trigger scintillators (MBTS) [28] are located on either side of ATLAS between the ID and the liquid-argon calorimeter at \u00b13.6 m from the IP. Each of the two MBTS detectors is oriented perpendicularly to the beam direction and consists of 16 panels assembled in two concentric rings, the outer ring covering the range 2.1 < |\u03b7| < 2.8 and the inner ring covering the range 2.8 < |\u03b7| < 3.8.\nThe ALFA detector system [8], located at z \u2248 \u00b1 240 m, consists of four Roman pot stations, containing vertically movable detectors that can approach the outgoing beams to within one millimetre. A schematic diagram of the detector arrangement relative to the ATLAS IP is shown in Fig. 2.\nEach station is equipped with two Roman pots, each of which hosts a nearly edgeless tracking detector composed of scintillating fibres, as depicted in Fig. 3.\nThe ALFA detector system has a limited radiation tolerance and takes data under conditions with low numbers (\u03bc) of\ndetector combinations (arms) used for the elastic measurement (Arm 1, orange, and Arm 2, purple) and the anti-elastic measurement (Arm 3, green, and Arm 4, pink). Each arm comprises two sections (armlets), consisting of two upper or lower detectors on a single side. The ALFA stations are numbered from A1 to A8 together with a more detailed designation. In these views the vertically deflected protons entering the different arms are indicated\nsimultaneous proton\u2013proton collisions interactions per beam crossing (pile-up).\nAn extensive software suite [29] is used in the reconstruction and analysis of real and simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment."

            "text": "The analysis makes use of two Monte Carlo (MC) signal generators: GenEx [30] and Dime [25].2 The models are similar, but not identical, and provide different predictions. The GenEx generator is used for the baseline calculations of detection and reconstruction efficiency for the events, and for corrections to the data, while Dime is used for comparison and to estimate model uncertainties.\n2 Some other generators, also suitable for modelling the considered process, became available later, e.g. ExDiff [31] and SuperChic [32].\nThe generator GenEx (version May 2015) is based on a theoretical model from Lebiedowicz et al. [24] and calculates the exclusive continuum production of \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 and K+K\u2212 pairs. It is based on a Regge-exchange description. The parameter determining the meson form factor (in its exponential parameterization) is the only free parameter. The implemented model describes non-resonant production without an absorption correction and does not include a rapidity gap survival factor (see e.g. Ref. [33]). In the present analysis, pions were generated within a region of pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.7, and with the off-shell-pion form-factor parameter set to off = 1 GeV. Otherwise, default program settings were used.\nThe generator Dime (version 1.06) similarly generates exclusive continuum production of \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 and K+K\u2212 pairs, although other channels are also implemented, e.g. exclusive \u03c1\u03c1 or \u03c6\u03c6 production. Unlike GenEx, Dime includes wider possibilities for modelling absorption effects: four different models (parameter i in, 1 \u2013 the default value used in our analysis; see Table 12 in Ref. [34]) for absorption are available\nThe trigger planes are not drawn. The local coordinate system, relative to the beamline, is indicated together with the projections of the leading outgoing proton momentum p and the angle \u03b8y ; the angle \u03b8x is defined similarly\nwith three different parameterizations of the meson form factor (exponential, \u2018Orear-like\u2019 \u2013 used in the present analysis, and power-like) [25].\nThe central diffractive background processes were generated by Pythia8 [35] (version 8.183), using the ATLAS A2 set of tuned parameters [36] and the MSTW2008lo PDF set [37]. Pythia8 employs a parton structure function approach and calculates the processes of central diffraction via double Pomeron exchange (DPE). The exclusive pion-pair process is removed from the dataset.\nThe Geant4 [38] toolkit is implemented to simulate the response of the ATLAS central and forward detectors [39]. The leading outgoing protons are transported to the ALFA locations using the beam parameter values and ALFA detector positions corresponding to the data-taking period [9] in which a special high-beta* optics, referred to here as the nominal optics, was employed. The MC events were reconstructed using the same ATLAS software chain as used for the data."

Each beam of the LHC was filled with one circulating proton bunch containing 7\u00b71010 protons. The integrated delivered luminosity and its uncertainty were determined to be L int = 78.7 \u00b1 0.1(stat) \u00b1 1.9 (syst)\u00b5b\u22121 [9].\nTwo event topological configurations are used in this analysis, covering four regions of phase space. They are referred to as elastic and anti-elastic and are based on signals in different combinations of four ALFA detectors, as shown in Fig. 2. Each detector combination is designated as an arm (following the existing ALFA notation [9]), and includes detectors on side A and side C in order to measure forward protons on each side of ATLAS. The elastic configuration makes use of two arm combinations: Arm1 = arm1368 = A1+A3+A6+A8 (elastic arm 0) and Arm2 = arm2457 = A2+A4+A5+A7 (elastic arm 1), while the anti-elastic configuration uses Arm3 = arm1357 = A1+A3+A5+A7 (anti-elastic arm 0) and Arm4 = arm2468 = A2+A4+A6+A8 (anti-elastic arm 1). Each arm comprises two armlets, consisting of two ALFA stations on either the A side or C side of ATLAS. The two configurations measure different ranges of momentum transfer to the pion system and their events were recorded by different combinations of triggers during data taking. They correspond physically to different kinematic phase-space regions, and theoretical models can differ in their estimates of cross-sections.\n5 Data analysis\n5.1 Event selection\nThe event topology for exclusive pion-pair production consists of two oppositely charged pions detected by the ATLAS ID, accompanied by a leading outgoing proton entering each of the ATLAS forward regions and detected by the ALFA\ndetector system. There should be no other activity in the ATLAS ID and in the inner cells of the MBTS, and the total three-momentum of the measured protons and pions must be consistent with zero.3 The data selections are summarized in Table 1. The order in which the selections were applied to the data is given in Table 2."

The data come from single colliding proton bunches in the LHC. The datarecording intervals that were used (\u2018lumi blocks\u2019) are required to be longer than 60 s in duration and the dead time must be smaller than 5%. \u2022 Trigger. For the elastic configuration, a coincidence in the upper A-side and lower C-side detectors or the lower A-side and upper C-side detectors was required [9] (see Fig. 2). The trigger efficiency within the geometrical acceptance of the detectors is measured to be (99.96 \u00b1 0.10)% [9]. For the anti-elastic configuration the relevant trigger (a signal in any of the eight ALFA detectors) was prescaled by a factor of 15, which resulted in a low numbers of recorded anti-elastic events. The\n3 The precise expectation value depends on the beam-crossing angle, which varied during the data taking and was at most 10\u00b5 rad in the y projection and smaller in x . The full effect is safely ignored since its impact is less than those of the ALFA detector resolution.\n\u2022 Overall momentum balance. Because of the limited reconstruction of the proton kinematics, a selection criterion for overall four-momentum conservation is not possible; instead the momentum balance in the x and y projections is used. The methods used for the reconstruction of the proton kinematics from the tracks measured by the ALFA detector are based on knowledge of the accelerator optics. As the mass of the centrally produced pion-pair system is low, the \u2018lattice\u2019 method [9], originally used for elastically scattered protons, can be applied. Proton momentum projections px and py are used in the analysis, and are reconstructed with a resolution of about 40 MeV and 1 MeV respectively. The transverse momentum components of the full pp\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 system are determined with a resolution of approximately 60 MeV in px and 20 MeV in py , denoted by \u03c3x and \u03c3y respectively. The signal region is defined by 3.5\u03c3x,y intervals about zero in px and py . \u2022 Fiducial condition. The exclusive production of pion pairs is studied within a fiducial region which is defined to be close to that which is allowed by the sub-detector acceptances. The data and Monte Carlo analyses use the same fiducial region, which is given in terms of the pseudorapidities \u03b7(\u03c0) and transverse momenta pT(\u03c0) of the individual pions, and the mass of the central pion system m\u03c0\u03c0 :\n|\u03b7(\u03c0)| < 2.5, pT(\u03c0) > 0.1 GeV, 2m\u03c0 < m\u03c0\u03c0 < 2.0 GeV.\nAdditional conditions are applied to the y-components of the proton momenta py(A) and py(C), in both the elastic and anti-elastic configurations:\narmletlow_cuti j < py(A) < armlet up_cut i j and\narmletlow_cutkl < py(C) < armlet up_cut kl ,\nwhere i jkl \u2208 {1368, 2457, 1357, 2468} and\narmletup_cut13 = 0.267 GeV, armletup_cut57 = 0.246 GeV, armletlow_cut13 = 0.080 GeV, armletlow_cut57 = 0.080 GeV, armletup_cut24 = \u22120.079 GeV, armletup_cut68 = \u22120.082 GeV, armletlow_cut24 = \u22120.250 GeV, armletlow_cut68 = \u22120.269 GeV.\nThese selections are evaluated in terms of the reconstructed ALFA proton kinematic parameters, calculated using the nominal beam optics and ALFA detector positions.

            "text": "The numbers of events after the successive selection conditions are shown in Table 2.\n5.2 Background estimation\nOne source of background consists of centrally produced pion pairs that are accidentally accompanied by one or more beam-halo protons which are detected in ALFA. This background is suppressed by the event selections to a low level. This can be seen in Fig. 5, which shows (a) the total multiplicity distribution of the MBTS inner rings for events that satisfy the selection criteria listed in Table 1, except for those on MBTS and momentum balance, and (b) after all the selections in Table 1 are applied. A fit to the data is performed in terms of a model comprising generated signal events (GenEx) and backgrounds from (i) generated diffractive events (Pythia8) and (ii) an \u2018accidentals\u2019 event sample formed from data events with a pion pair that are combined with unrelated data events randomly found to have ALFA signals. For exclusive pion events, the MBTS multiplicity is at most one, while for other diffractive events it can be higher. Events with accidental coincidences can give both higher and lower MBTS multiplicities. Such events are contained in the event sample, but Fig. 5b shows that they contribute no contamination to the signal region |pa | < 3.5\u03c3a , where a = x, y (see Sect. 5.1.1), after all conditions listed in Table 1 are applied.\nThe very strong effect of the MBTS veto on background suppression is demonstrated also in Fig. 6, which shows that the summed vertical (y-axis) track momenta exhibit a clear signal peak in the total py of the event only after this veto is applied. Figure 6a includes events with selections up to those on the ID and ALFA tracks listed in Table 2, while Fig. 6b shows the same data and backgrounds but with the MBTS veto also applied. The background was fitted outside the signal region, which approximately covers the central three plotted intervals. The signal peak is now prominent.\nSince the data were taken during the special run with very low pile-up, the remaining backgrounds, after applying the event selections of Sect. 5.1, presumably originate from other central diffraction processes. For both the elastic and antielastic event configurations, the backgrounds due to these diffraction processes are estimated using events satisfying the complete set of selections listed in Table 1 except for the requirement on the momentum balance in the x and y projections. They are evaluated from a fit to the py distribution of the data outside the signal region, using a model consisting of a background generated by Pythia8 and accidentals. This is shown in Fig. 7a, while Fig. 7b shows the distribution with all the selections applied.\n5.3 Beam and ALFA modelling inefficiencies, correction procedure\nThe implementation of the ALFA detector in the ATLAS simulation framework has some limitations. The response can differ from that of the real detector, mainly due to imperfect implementation of signal and noise production mechanisms and the omission of electronic cross-talk between channels.\nSince the simulation does not include the production of particle showers that are due to the interaction of forward-\ngoing particles with parts of the LHC (accelerator beam pipe, collimators, shielding of magnets, etc.), the uv-condition is introduced, effectively removing these showers from the data. This affects the signal, and the corresponding correction depends on the elastic or anti-elastic configuration (\u2018conf\u2019) and the arm. A further correction is required for the clean track selection (Sect. 5.1).\nIf the MC description were perfect, the detector efficiency \u03b5, for a given arm and configuration, would be written as\nand y projections, while in b all the final selections are applied. The histograms of the MC predictions and the accidentals are stacked. Statistical uncertainties of the MC events and accidentals are combined. The underflow and overflow bins (|py | > 1 GeV) are shown\n(\u03b5)confarm = [(\nNtrk Nacc\n)MC]conf\narm\n, (1)\nwhere Ntrk is the number of generated MC signal events with at least one track reconstructed in each of the detectors in a given configuration and Nacc is the number of MC signal events within the acceptance of that configuration.\nSince the MC simulation does not contain all relevant effects, the uv-condition and the clean track selection are introduced and Eq. (1) is now rewritten as\n( \u03b5\u2032 )conf arm = [( Ntrk Nuv )data \u00d7 ( Nuv Nacc )MC]conf\narm\ndef= [ rdata \u00d7 tMC ]conf\narm , (2)\nwhere Nuv is the number of events which pass the uvcondition. The first factor in Eq. (2) is given by physics that can be mismodelled by generators, and the second factor takes account of the clean track selection.\nDenoting Rconfarm = ( oMC/odata )conf arm , where the ratio o\nX = NX, clean/NX, any gives the ratio of the number of events with clean tracks to all events in a given track sample X (MC or data), the combined correction factor f s+uv,confarm , where s+uv denotes the combination of single tracks and uv-conditions, is written as\nf s+uv,confarm = ( \u03b5/\u03b5\u2032 \u00d7 R)confarm\nwhich, using Eq. (2), can be re-written as\nf s+uv,confarm = ( rMC/rdata \u00d7 oMC/odata )conf\narm .\n+ ( N conf1 \u2212 Bconf1 ) \u00d7 Cconf1 ] \u00d7 1\nconftrig \u00b7 DAQ\nwhere L represents the integrated luminosity used; N confarm and Bconfarm are the numbers of selected signal candidate events and calculated background events in each arm; Cconfarm = f s+uv,confarm / f corr,confarm ; conftrig is the trigger efficiency for the given configuration; DAQ is the dead-time correction factor, as defined and determined in Ref. [9].\n5.4 Kinematic distributions\nTaking into account the precision of the reconstruction, the kinematic distributions of the pions and protons are well modelled by the MC simulations. Figures 8, 9 and 10 show comparisons of the distributions of the momentum components of the reconstructed pions and protons, and the pionpair rapidity, acoplanarity, transverse momentum and invariant mass, for the data and the GenEx MC and Dime MC simulations. The distributions are presented after applying\nall the event selections, but without applying a background subtraction (\u2248 10%) to the data. In view of the low number of events for the anti-elastic configuration, only distributions for the elastic configuration are shown.\n5.5 Systematic uncertainties\nThe overall systematic uncertainty on the exclusive pion-pair cross-section measurement is estimated as +6.4\u22124.2 % for the elastic configuration and +6.0\u22124.4 % for the anti-elastic configuration. Table 4 summarizes the main sources of systematic uncertainty. The difference between the relative uncertainties of the two configurations comes mainly from data-driven systematic uncertainties. Some of the MC studies made use of slightly enlarged fiducial region criteria to estimate systematic uncertainties.\nBackground determination. The systematic uncertainty is determined as half of the difference between the background estimates for the standard signal region, 3.5\u03c3x,y around zero\nin px and py , and for the case when the signal region is increased to 5\u03c3x,y . It is symmetrized.\nLHC beam energy. The systematic uncertainty due to that of the nominal beam energy is based on a beam energy variation of about \u00b10.1% [41]. Thicknesses of material. An uncertainty in the amount of material in the ID is calculated by changing this by +5% and +10% in the whole ID and by +10% in the pixel detector to determine the difference between the lowest and the highest value of the corrected exclusive pion-pair cross-section [40].\nMBTS Veto. The MBTS veto uncertainty determination is based on the corresponding procedure used in the measurement of the inelastic proton\u2013proton cross-section at \u221a s =\n7 TeV [42].\nSelection criteria. The uncertainty in the efficiency due to the selection criteria is determined from the fraction of lost signal. The overall uncertainty in the ALFA reconstruction efficiency is determined by varying the event selection criteria and summing the corresponding individual uncertainties in quadrature. Correction factors. An uncertainty in the values of f s+uv,confarm arises from the restricted selection of data that is used to evaluate this factor in each arm. Although of statistical origin, this is treated as a systematic uncertainty.\nBeam optics. This analysis uses data at a collision energy of 7 TeV and with high \u03b2 = 90 m beam optics, referred to as the nominal optics. Based on data measurements, an adjustment is made to the current-to-field calibration offset\nTable 4 Summary of the exclusive pion-pair cross-section systematic uncertainties\nSource of uncertainty Uncertainty (%)\nElastic Anti-elastic\nTrigger efficiency trig \u00b10.1 \u00b10.3 Background determination \u00b13.5 \u00b13.5 Signal and background corrections:\nBeam energy \u00b10.1 \u00b10.1 ID material +4.8 +4.1 Veto on MBTS signal \u00b11.3 \u00b12.0 ALFA single-track selection \u00b10.9 \u00b10.9 ALFA reconstruction efficiency \u00b10.9 \u00b10.8 ALFA geometry selection \u00b10.5 \u00b10.5 Optics \u00b11.1 \u00b11.0 Overall systematic uncertainty +6.4 +6.0 \u22124.2 \u22124.4 Statistical uncertainty \u00b121.2 \u00b161.6 Theoretical modelling \u00b12.8 \u00b18.0 Luminosity \u00b11.2 \u00b11.2\nbetween the Q1Q3 and Q2 quadrupole magnets to derive the so-called effective optics [9]. Studies related to both optics are performed: the effective and the nominal optics are used in MC simulation to calculate all the corrections applied in reconstructing the data. The nominal optics is used as the baseline; the difference in the cross-section values is used to determine the systematic uncertainties.\nModelling. The analysis of the data uses the generator GenEx as the baseline for modelling the signal sample. The full analysis is repeated using the generator Dime, and the difference between the resulting cross-sections is taken as an\nExclusive \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 cross-section [\u00b5b] Elastic configuration\nMeasurement 4.8\u00b11.0 (stat) +0.3\u22120.2 (syst)\u00b1 0.1 (lumi) \u00b1 0.1 (model)\nGenEx \u00d70.22 (absorptive correction) 1.5 Dime 1.6\nAnti-elastic configuration\nMeasurement 9 \u00b1 6 (stat) +1\u22121 (syst) \u00b1 1 (lumi) \u00b1 1 (model)\nGenEx \u00d70.22 (absorptive correction) 2 Dime 3\nuncertainty due to the modelling and is applied symmetrically."

The fiducial region is defined in Sect. 5.1.1 and the results are presented in Table 5.\nThere are 28 candidate signal events in the elastic configuration and 3 in the anti-elastic configuration (see Table 2). These include an estimated 2.9 background events in the elastic configuration (\u2248 10%) and 0.2 background events (\u2248 6%) in the anti-elastic configuration.\nThe results may be compared with cross-sections provided by MC generators using the same fiducial region definition: 1.5\u00b5b (elastic configuration) and 2\u00b5b (anti-elastic configuration) in the case of GenEx (these have been multiplied by an absorptive correction, abs. corr.), and 1.6\u00b5b (elastic configuration) and 3\u00b5b (anti-elastic configuration) in the case of Dime. The absorptive correction [25] applied here to GenEx covers possible rescatterings of the particles entering the process and complicates the simple picture in Fig. 1. The value used of 0.22 was communicated by its author; the correction is not included in GenEx itself and is, in general, kinematics and model dependent. It is not used in the experimental analysis, since the MC distributions are normalized to data, but only in the present comparison with the results. The measured anti-elastic cross-section has a large statistical uncertainty, and is not statistically different from zero, which prevents strong conclusions from being drawn."
