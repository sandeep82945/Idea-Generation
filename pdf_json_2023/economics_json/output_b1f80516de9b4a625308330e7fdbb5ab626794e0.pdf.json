    "abstractText": "Over 30% of the global GDP and 60% of the worldwide population are involved in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), making it one of the greatest development projects in the world. If infrastructure developments in BRI countries are successful, economic growth in those nations will increase dramatically. Using data from 2005 to 2020, this research examines the relationships between environmental psychology, green finance, and sustainable development and variables such as GDP per capita and its square, green financing, government expenditure, and human capital in 57 strategically chosen BRI economies. Economists used cutting-edge techniques that take into account multiple variables at once in their analysis, such as cross-sectional dependence, unit root testing, co-integration analysis, IFE estimation, dynamic panel data (DCCE), and generalized method of moments (system GMM). The findings indicate that green financing, government spending, and GDP per capita squared reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. In this analysis, the level of human capital is similar to GDP per capita in its beneficial effect on carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are negatively impacted by government spending, which has a minor effect on GDP per capita, green financing, and human capital. Using the results of this study, the authors offer recommendations for how a country can reduce its carbon output.",

            "text": "Initiated in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was formerly known as the One Belt One Road initiative (Huang et\u00a0al. 2022b; Rao et\u00a0al. 2022). Connecting the \u201cSilk Road Economic Belt\u201d and the \u201c21st Century Maritime Silk Road,\u201d the BRI is one of the largest infrastructure projects in the world. In a nutshell, it will link China to the rest of Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and South and Southeast Asia. Therefore, more than 60% of the world\u2019s population and 30% of the world\u2019s GDP\nare involved in this enormous undertaking (Khokhar et\u00a0al. 2020; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021c). One hundred forty-one nations and 32 intergovernmental organizations have committed to working together on BRI projects as of October 2021 (International Cooperation Advisory Council of the Belt and Road Forum in 2019 and 2020). According to projections, annual investment in the BRI will be between $2.90 and $6.30 trillion (Hou et\u00a0al. 2019; Huang et\u00a0al. 2022a).\nThere has never been a time in human history when climate change has posed such a grave threat to human survival. The increased use of fossil fuel energies and economic growth experienced over the last century has led to historically high levels of GHG emissions, which are widely acknowledged as a primary cause of global climate change. In order to lessen the impact of CO2 emissions on the environment, there is a large body of research devoted to understanding what factors contribute to this pollutant\u2019s release into the atmosphere. Since fossil fuels account for about 80% of global energy consumption, it stands to reason that they are also a major source of CO2 emissions (among many others). The environmental and health impacts of GHG emissions may be mitigated, however, if the world\u2019s Responsible Editor: Nicholas Apergis * Fen Yang FYang202209@163.com Haiyan Feng hy20112020@163.com 1 College of\u00a0Economics and\u00a0Management, Taiyuan University of\u00a0Technology, Taiyuan\u00a0030002, Shanxi, China\n2 Beijing Academy of\u00a0Science and\u00a0Technology, Beijing\u00a0100089, China\n1 3\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:39946\u201339960\ntotal renewable-based power capacity grows by 50% between 2019 and 2024 (Anser et\u00a0al. 2020a; Latif et\u00a0al. 2021). Some research has shown that green finance can help reduce global CO2 emissions, for example (Iqbal et\u00a0al. 2020; Iqbal et\u00a0al. 2021a; Liu et\u00a0al. 2022a; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2022).\nAccording to Zheng et\u00a0al. (2021a), BRI countries like China are aware that pollution and other environmental damage are inevitable consequences of economic development. To lessen the impact of economic growth, the governments of these nations are prioritizing the green economy and greening their infrastructure (Iqbal et\u00a0al. 2021b). China has proposed a comprehensive BRI rollout to support and cover numerous areas of the 2030 SDGs. By strictly enforcing standards for low-carbon and environmentally friendly infrastructure development, China is committed to boosting green and low-carbon operations (Hou et\u00a0al. 2022). One of the new ideas for the BRI is for its members to collaborate on environmental regulation and the development of green technologies, energy technology, and green funding (Advisory Council of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in 2019 and 2020, 2020). Furthermore, China has introduced an eco-friendly feature of its management system for supply chains to bring green products to consumers under the green BRI umbrella (Ikram et\u00a0al. 2019; Sarfraz et\u00a0al. 2021; Yang et\u00a0al. 2021). In addition to the aforementioned, the current strong supply chain network of BRI would preserve the quality of perishable foods to stop environmental degradation caused by the food going bad. To sum up, Green BRI is designed to encourage new BRI investment projects that prioritize environmental friendliness, such as through the use of green financial instruments (Mohsin et\u00a0al. 2020a, 2020b; Naseem et\u00a0al. 2021).\nGreen finance is a relatively new form of finance that attempts to reconcile the conflicting goals of economic development and environmental protection by integrating these two crucial but traditionally separate spheres of activity: resource allocation and environmental governance (Anser et\u00a0al. 2020b; Sun et\u00a0al. 2019; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021a). Green financial policies can successfully internalize environmental externalities, resolving the conflict between nonequilibrium flows of financial resources and environmental aims. Green finance policies can steer the more desirable growth of the economic and social environment by providing precedence to green industries and low-carbon technology innovation initiatives in the distribution of social resources. China\u2019s overall green finance reached $1.93 trillion by the year 2020, with green credit balances accounting for $1.78 trillion (or more than 90%) of the total, and the financing size of green bonds and green equity both reaching $0.15 trillion (Hsu et\u00a0al. 2021; Mohsin et\u00a0al. 2022; Sun et\u00a0al. 2020). Green finance is a new trend in China\u2019s future financial development and is experiencing significant growth in both rate and increase, which has far-reaching implications for the\nattainment of reductions in carbon emissions goals (Chandio et\u00a0al. 2022; Mohsin et\u00a0al. 2020c). While researchers have looked at how green financial regulations affect corporate investment and finance, green technological innovation, and carbon emissions in the past, they can not seem to agree on how this financial development affects carbon reductions (Liu et\u00a0al. 2022d). Given the recent rapid growth of green financing and the importance of decreasing CO2 emissions in China, elucidating the connection between the two is vital (Liu et\u00a0al. 2022e). In addition, China\u2019s rapid industrial regionalization pattern has spurred the development of cross-regional industrial chain division networks and innovation networks (Si et\u00a0al. 2021), which have strengthened industrial ties across regions and had some impact on regional emissions. In fact, carbon emission reduction patterns and low-carbon technology application in the region may result from the existence of inter-regional industrial associations and imitation behaviors, setting off a strong demonstration effect in the surrounding regions through technology spillover and knowledge dissemination (Sarma and Roy 2021). At the same time, environmental pollutants like carbon dioxide are easily diffused, and differences in local environmental policies and the absence of coordinated emission reduction policies among regions may induce the near transfer of pollution (Wang et\u00a0al. 2021). This suggests that reducing carbon emissions goes beyond the local environmental governance issues in specific regions. However, the existing literature has only examined the impact of green finance policies on local CO2 emissions, paying little attention to the domino effect that these policies have on nearby regions.\nRecent empirical research on transitional economies are supported by the estimated results, which reveal a positive and large impact of green financing on growth whereas government spending has a negative and significant impact on growth (Xiong et\u00a0al. 2022; Xu et\u00a0al. 2022, 2021). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that there is a negative and statistically significant interaction between green financing and government spending, indicating that the connection is not complementary. At very high levels of government spending, the negative and material impact of financial development on growth becomes more pronounced. But when budgets are tight, the impact is beneficial and noticeable. According to the projected results, excessive government spending can dampen the growth-promoting effects of financial development, whereas insufficient spending has the opposite effect. The data also show that financial efficiency and access have a favorable and large impact on economic growth, but financial depth has a negligible impact. More so than financial efficiency, it is argued that access to financial resources is what really drives economic expansion. In a similar vein, when government spending is very large, the marginal impact of financial depth, access, and efficiency\n39947\n1 3\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:39946\u201339960\nis negative. The crowding out and crowding in effects of government expenditure are examined, and the study concludes with new data on the nonlinear influence of finance on growth (Ren et\u00a0al. 2020).\nTo that purpose, we use annual data for 57 BRI provinces from 2005 to 2020 to assess the significance of variables such as environmental psychology, green financing, government expenditure, and human capital in attaining sustainable growth. This research fulfills an important function by contributing useful new knowledge to the literary canon. The findings of this research can lend credence to the importance of public funding for green finance. There has not been a definitive study showing that government expenditure does not affect the market mechanism. This research suggests reducing carbon emissions by increasing public spending, and provides empirical evidence for the existence of a composition and technique effect. This research finds that increases in public spending are correlated with green financing. In addition, this study\u2019s overarching goal is to explore the moderating impact of GDP per capita, green financing, and human capital on carbon emission. However, the authors of this work use a novel set of econometric techniques\u2014including cross-sectional dependence, CADF and CIPS unit root tests, panel cointegration testing, IFE & DCCE estimator, and system GMM\u2014to achieve their goals. The rest of the study is organized as follows: A thorough literature review is provided in the \u201cLiterature Review\u201d section, followed by an explanation of the research\u2019s data and methods in the \u201cData and Methodology\u201d section, a discussion of the study\u2019s empirical findings in the \u201cResults and discussion\u201d section, and a summary and policy recommendations in the \u201cConclusion and policy suggestions\u201d section."

            "text": "Only the effects on people\u2019s ability to stay alive and grow are meant by \u201cenvironment\u201d in this strict meaning. Environmental problems, as defined by Liu et\u00a0al. (2022b), include loss of environmental quality and ecological damage caused by both natural causes and human actions. The environmental issues identified by Tu et\u00a0al. (2021) were further categorized into two groups: primary and secondary. Primary environmental problems, or those generated by natural processes, are distinguished from secondary environmental problems, or those caused by humans, by the terms \u201ctype one\u201d and \u201ctype two,\u201d respectively. Carbon emissions are created in numerous ways during the manufacturing process (Sarangi 2019). The term \u201ctrade embodied carbon,\u201d coined by Guang-Wen and Siddik (2022a), describes the amount of carbon dioxide equivalents used in both the direct and indirect production of a country\u2019s traded goods and services. The influence of external influences on carbon emissions is referred to as the\ncarbon emission effect (Du et\u00a0al. 2022; United Nations Environment Programme 2017).\nEnvironmental protection and long-term economic growth both benefit from green finance. Policies taken straight from the textbook, such as carbon levies and emissions reduction targets, have been found wanting. One issue is that there is a lot of uncertainty around green investments due to the high volatility of emissions trading systems, particularly certificates purchased on the financial market (Shipalana 2020). While carbon taxes are straightforward to enact and maintain, they do not provide enough of a spur for enterprises to make the transition to green technology since they are too sluggish to initiate replacement procedures and can be handed on to customers (Arif et\u00a0al. 2021). Furthermore, the policy requires an extremely high tax in order to be effective. Saeed Meo and Karim (2021) examine this phenomenon from a global viewpoint and find that pollution burdens are being transferred among Belt and Road economies as a result of FDI and preferential trade agreements. They also discover that middle-income nations are the ones hit the most by the pollution burden shifting caused by technical advancements, and that environmental measures in trade agreements have little binding influence on this. This highlights the importance of taking a fresh approach to environmental protection by actively encouraging funding for green technology. One way to accomplish this is by official government action. Chinese Green Climate Fund financing and allocation strategies are documented by Steckel et\u00a0al. (2017) to aid local governments in climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. They conclude that the financing burden should fall mostly on large historical polluters, whereas the greatest gains would accrue to less developed regions. The use of green finance to incentivize green investment is a free-market strategy.\nThe impact of green finance, which prioritizes environmental safety and long-term economic growth, is twofold: First, the demand and supply for eco-friendly, long-term growth are both influenced by green finance. It does double duty, steering firms toward a greener, more sustainable production while piquing consumers\u2019 interest in being green. In order to demonstrate how a company\u2019s sustainability performance can significantly impact its financial situation, Mngumi et\u00a0al. (2022) give an example of how non-compliance with environmental requirements can negatively impact cash flow and lower market value. Second, green finance encourages the financial sector as a whole to prioritize longterm sustainability and reduce reliance on short-term gains by emphasizing the importance of sustainable development (Zheng et\u00a0al. 2021b). Ecological screening and risk evaluation are used to determine which investments and loans best adhere to sustainability requirements, as explained in more detail by \u00dcn\u00fcvar (2019). In addition, insurance against environmental and climatic risks is a part of green\n39948\n1 3\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:39946\u201339960\nfinance. Emission right-based lending is an intriguing form of green finance that Zerbib (2019) investigate. When businesses invest in pollution prevention and environmentally friendly technologies, they are rewarded with a reduction in their emission quotas under this system. Then, the loan applications are secured by the emission rights as collateral. Based on their theoretical model, they conclude that the emission right-based funding model benefits both firms and banks and encourages investment in green technology at reasonable levels of market demand. For this reason, Zheng et\u00a0al. (2021c) demonstrate that green financing can generate acceptable returns.\nOne of the biggest obstacles to investing in environmentally friendly technology is its price tag. Investing in green technologies requires substantial capital upfront but pays dividends only in the very long run. Also, credit scores will be worse because there is more risk involved with investing in cutting-edge tech. Green investments are more susceptible to market swings due to their dependence on rising or falling carbon prices (Pham and Luu Duc Huynh 2020). Investments in environmentally friendly technologies face an increasingly challenging economic environment due to these factors. For this reason, (Nassiry 2018) advocate for government-backed bonds as a useful instrument for risk mitigation. The government can improve the return and cut the cost of capital for environmentally friendly initiatives by guaranteeing all or part of the service and repayment. Because of this, a broader economic revolution can take place, not only one confined to giant corporations that have few financial constraints, and it also has the effect of allowing smaller companies to join in the move towards green technology. Also, because of their long maturities, bonds are ideally suited for the massive infrastructure projects required by green technology; and because of stricter disclosure requirements than regular bonds, green bonds carry less of a chance of default, bringing returns and a sense of social responsibility to investors Liu et\u00a0al. (2019). Instead, Srivastava et\u00a0al. (2021) focus on the function of \u201cgreen central banking,\u201d in which central banks facilitate the growth of green financing models and mandate the price of environmental and carbon risk.\nBut it is an empirical question whether or not green money is successful in protecting the environment. Data for the study from the Global Footprint Network and the Asian Development Bank are used by Dmuchowski et\u00a0al. (2021) to analyze the effect of climate protection banking (as a proxy for sustainable banking) on the ecological footprint in 26 countries, controlling for factors such as GDP per capita, inhabitants, trade openness, and energy consumption. Green financing is found to be effective, in that it greatly reduces the environmental impact of financing, even after taking into account the fixed effects of individual countries.\nIt is worth noting that this study has limitations due to its limited sample size and the possibility of self-selection; for example, countries with higher costs associated with lowering their ecological footprint may spend less on green financing. Another similar analysis is conducted by Hafner et\u00a0al. (2020), albeit with different data sets. In particular, the authors warn against relying on either public or private sector-led green finance alone, as doing so would be to neglect the joint influences.\nSimilar research is conducted by Wang and Zhi (2016) who look into the connection between environmentally friendly financing and greenhouse gas production. Using a quantile-on-quality regression, the authors discover a negative correlation between green financing and carbon dioxide emissions in the USA, Sweden, Hong Kong, the UK, and Switzerland, with weaker correlations in, Norway, New Zealand, Denmark, Japan, and Canada. Yet there are differences even within nations. In the USA, for instance, a positive correlation holds between low levels of green finance and high levels of carbon dioxide emissions. When carbon dioxide emissions are high, however, demand for green investments rises, as shown by data for New Zealand. Overall, green finance has a negative association with emissions, but the effect is asymmetric and varies with both the level of emissions and the quantity of green finance, which may point to a more nuanced relationship between the two. Clark (2019) examines whether China\u2019s green finance-related regulations have considerably decreased industrial gas emissions by analyzing data from 290 cities between 2011 and 2018. Using a difference-in-differences method, they discover green finance-related policies caused substantial positive environmental outcomes, including a 38% decrease in sculpture dioxide emissions, a 28% decrease in industrial gas and smoke emissions, and a 20% decrease in overall sculpture dioxide production. They also find that the growth of financial technology helps China cut down on emissions by easing the country\u2019s adaptation to a green financial system. Endogeneity and simultaneity are not addressed, however, which is a problem that Jin and Han (2018) also had.\nA greater degree of fiscal decentralization in China means more money for provincial and municipal governments. But this will not always lead to more spending on CO2 mitigation by municipal governments (Tolliver et\u00a0al. 2019). This is because there is little pressure placed on municipal governments to cut carbon output. However, CO2 is a worldwide public good (Sachs et\u00a0al. 2019). Local CO2 emissions have a smaller impact on people\u2019s quality of life than do most other types of pollution. This means they will not put enough pressure on local governments to get them to cut back on carbon emissions. On the other hand, higher-ups in government are the\n39949\n1 3\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:39946\u201339960\nones who ultimately decide which officials at the lower levels to promote. High-level governments care more about economic indicators than they do about reducing CO2 emissions (Lv et\u00a0al. 2021). So, it is more likely that municipalities will invest in economic growth. The current literature also suggests that as local fiscal decentralization and the fiscal authority of local governments rise, local CO2 emissions may not decrease, but increase (Khan et\u00a0al. 2021). This means that federal authorities need to intervene in local efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. From a survey of the scholarly literature, we learn that most research on CO2 emissions in China have been conducted at the province level (Dong et\u00a0al. 2022; Guild 2020; Liu et\u00a0al. 2022b). To reduce carbon dioxide emissions, however, urban areas must be taken into account."

This results in a Prisoner\u2019s dilemma where the dominant option is for enterprises to free ride on the investments of others and not abate, leading to a Nash equilibrium that is socially undesirable. Consequently, Ning et\u00a0al. (2021) advocated a climate club to address the free-riding issue, in which members would be obligated to invest in abatement technology while trade fines would be levied on non-members. Therefore, countries with low emissions and cheap abatement costs will be the ones to join the climate club. However, countries with high emission levels and expensive abatement costs are unlikely to join the club since they would rather face the consequences than reduce their emissions. It is reasonable to treat corporations as if they were countries, provided that there was a price to pay for polluting the environment. Companies with higher emissions and higher abatement costs will opt to pay the penalty rather than reduce their emissions, whereas companies with lower emissions and cheaper abatement costs will join the club. Therefore, the expense of abatement and the need to invest in abatement technologies will determine whether a company chooses to abate or pay the penalty. Bringing down the price of investing in abatement technology is one way that green BRI and other member countries may encourage more businesses to join the club and abate. One strategy for doing this is to use green finance to reduce the cost of funding green construction projects. Therefore, in agreement with Liu et\u00a0al.

(2022), conventional technologies have a negative effect on GDP per capita by lowering energy efficiency, which is the root source of carbon emissions. Even more so, such results imply that economies of worry expand, which may lead to an increase in environmental degradation. Ecological consciousness is yet in its formative stages; hence, citizens of several developing economies do not insist on using green energy. Additionally, numerous plants and factories that are the major cause of ED have not shut down despite the aforementioned logic over the period. So, our result is similar to what was found in Lee (2020b).\nAccording to Table\u00a0 7, there is a negative effect of green funding on carbon emissions of \u2212 0.462%, \u2212 0.486%, \u2212 0.573%, and \u2212 0.186%, with a statistically significant coefficient at the 1% level. As such, it agrees with international research by scholars such as Adeleke and Josue (2019); Feng et\u00a0al. (2022); Stojanovi\u0107 (2020); Zhang et\u00a0al. (2019); Zhang et\u00a0al. (2021b). This is a significant finding because it proves that green financial instruments can help a region become environmentally friendlier (Geddes et\u00a0al. 2018). This is one of the finest ways to slow down or stop environmental deterioration (Li et\u00a0al. 2021). In turn, sustainable growth in the region will be bolstered by the increased production of green energy thanks to the region\u2019s cleaner surroundings. This finding also demonstrates the success of the Green Finance Task Force and the governments of BRI nations in their efforts to promote green finance. Green loans enable businesses to reduce environmental impact and preserve environmental quality by funding the purchase and implementation of environmentally friendly raw materials and green technologies in ecologically beneficial initiatives. Results show that green finance plays a crucial part in lowering environmental deterioration in the BRI region, despite being novel and not yet well embraced by standard financial institutions. However, the global economic downturn was exacerbated by a lack of funding for green initiatives because of the COVID-19 pandemic, as stated by Rasoulinezhad and Taghizadeh-Hesary (2022). Green bonds are an important instrument of green finance that can be used to support a wide variety of environmentally conscious\ninitiatives, and the governments of BRI member countries would be wise to issue more of them in light of empirical evidence linking green finance and reduced environmental degradation to greater sustainable growth. This will, in turn, aid in reviving the economy in the BRI region.\nThe results of this study dispel the worry that rising government spending will lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions. With a 1% increase in government spending, carbon emissions are reduced by \u2212 0.238%, \u2212 0.275%, \u2212 0.176%, and \u2212 0.876%, respectively, improving environmental quality in BRI at the 5% level of significance. Many BRI provinces are unhappy with the country\u2019s growing size of government because of the strain it has placed on public spending. Government spending on public services and amenities has also grown. According to the results of this investigation, the BRI administration appears to have spent money with environmental considerations in mind. There have been checks and balances put in place to make sure the environment is not severely harmed by increased government expenditures, which may increase energy consumption by government ministries, departments, and agencies. In the vein of Zeng et\u00a0al. (2022b), this study also hints that the country\u2019s recent spending on social and public goods has contributed to a decrease in carbon emission. Spending on things like school buildings, health education, and enforcing environmental laws are all worthy of mention. Money spent trying to stop illicit logging could have played a role in this result. Furthermore, one may argue that the growing government expenditure has placed money in people\u2019s pockets, which has allowed them to acquire energyefficient technologies, helping to cut carbon pollution and verifying the hypothesis. Similar results have been observed in the empirical work of Pal and Russel (2015).\nAs a contrast, human capital is found to have a positive and statistically significant relationship with carbon emissions at the 0.647%, 0.245%, 0.063%, and 0.721% levels, respectively. This is not shocking, though, because human capital is crucial to economic expansion, and because, according to the EKC hypothesis, more economic activity has the potential to increase carbon emissions. Inferences similar to this have been drawn in previous studies, which imply that\n39955\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:39946\u201339960\nenvironmental pollution is directly tied to human economic activity due to increased energy demand and consumption (Nassani et\u00a0al. 2017). The findings imply that the production of human capital reduces the effect of carbon emissions in the manufacturing and other sectors, while increasing emissions in the residential and transportation sectors.\nIt is important to look into the secondary effects, such as those of government spending on GDP per capita, green financing, and human capital on carbon emission levels, in addition to the primary effect. Carbon emissions were negatively impacted by \u2212 0.635%, \u2212 0.617%, and \u2212 0.532% due to the government\u2019s limited participation in spending."

            "text": "There is a popular concern that environmental quality may not be sustained for future generations because of government spending on green finance, as evidenced by both historical literature and data. Human capital, the square root of\n39956\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:39946\u201339960\nGDP per capita, and the GDP per capita are also important factors in determining carbon emissions. The BRI\u2019s massive construction projects exacerbate the environmental degradation that is plaguing the world at large. This work uses cross-sectional dependence, CADF and CIPS unit root tests, Westerlund co-integration, and the IFE and DCCE tests, as well as a system generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine the long-run behavior of the explained variable. This research found that higher levels of CO2 are the result of higher per capita GDP and higher levels of human capital. Green financing and government spending as well as GDP per capita squared have all been linked to lower emissions. These unintended consequences lead to lower carbon emissions and greater sustainable development.\nOur study was conducted with the intention of informing effective policy actions on CO2 in BRI economies. The report finds that when income is included, CO2 emissions are reduced. According to these results, a greener approach to economic growth is something to think about for the future. To be more specific, the plan will cause greater pollution if it depends on oil, coal, and metal production. Promoting expansion in the service and technology economies is preferred in this context. Cutting back on fossil fuel use and increasing the use of renewables in power generation is another policy option to think about. As a third strategy, the governments of the BRI economies can enact legislation like a high carbon tax, carbon capture, and emission trading programs.\nThe empirical findings suggest green financing considerably mitigates environmental degradation in the BRI region. To this end, it is imperative that governments of BRI nations maintain their efforts to advance environmentally responsible forms of financing. Interest rate subsidies on green loans are only one example of how governments could use green finance to help slow environmental degradation. Green finance should be promoted not just by the government, but also by private and traditional financial institutions. Governments can encourage private sector participation by offering large incentives, including large corporation tax savings, to private financial institutions that promote and deliver green finance. In addition, there is a higher chance of losing money in the green industry because its revenues are less assured than those of more established traditional industries. This means private lenders will be more selective when it comes to providing green loans. As a result, governments may explore creating green credit guarantee schemes to expand the availability of green loans. In addition to green finance, BRI member countries are advised to consider environmental concerns in urban development and increase domestic production for export owing to trade openness in order to prevent environmental damage.\nCarbon emissions are reduced as a result of government expenditures, suggesting that the government is careful with its money. It will be useful in achieving a low-carbon\neconomy if the government can ensure a steady flow of tax income to fund its operations. It is crucial for the government to make good use of income earned in this era when economic, political, social, and health crises might cause revenue shortfall for government expenditure. The current revenue and expenditure system can be improved to accomplish this. There should be no easing of civic society\u2019s checks and balances. Future research on the topic for other emerging countries should, when possible, aggregate government spending and examine its implications on carbon emissions.\nOur results imply that national strategies to foster advanced human capital not only contribute to economic growth, in line with endogenous growth theory, but can also be an effective method to mitigate climate change. Therefore, rather than enacting rules and regulations to deal with climate change, investing in highly skilled human capital may be a more efficient and less distorting option. Our findings imply that protecting the environment is a significant social externality that comes from monetary investment in human capital.\nAcknowledgements Supported by Shanxi Federation of Social Science \u201cThe Research on the Upgrading Path of Coal Industry in Shanxi Province\u201d (Grant No. SSKLZDKT2016049); Beijing Innovation Project \u201cResearch on the mechanism of digital economy promoting regional green development\u201d (Grant No. 11000022T000000445886)\nAuthor contribution Haiyan Feng; conceptualization, data curation, methodology, writing\u2014original draft, data curation, visualization, Fen Yang; supervision, editing, writing\u2014review and editing, and software.\nData availability The data can be available on request."
