    "abstractText": "Due to their fascinating topological structures and application prospects, coordination supramolecular complexes have continuously been studied by scientists. However, the controlled construction and property study of organometallic handcuffs remains a significant and challenging research subject in the area of supramolecular chemistry. Hence, a series of tetranuclear organometallic and heterometallic handcuffs bearing different size and metal types were rationally designed and successfully synthesized by utilizing a quadridentate pyridyl ligand (tetra-(3-pyridylphenyl)ethylene) based on three Cp*Rh (Cp* = \u03b7-C5Me5) fragments bearing specific longitudinal dimensions and conjugated planes. These results were determined with single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis technology, ESI-MS NMR spectroscopy, etc. Importantly, the photoquenching effect of Cp* groups and the discrepancy of intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions between building block and half-sandwich fragments promote markedly different photothermal conversion results. These results will further push the synthesis of topological structures and the development of photothermal conversion materials.",

            "text": "In recent decades, coordination supramolecular chemistry has made rapid progress and has become an important chemical field not only due to its exquisite topological structures but also for its dependence on promising application prospects in covering host\u2013guest chemistry [1\u20134], biosimulation [5\u20137], fluorescence [8\u201310], photothermal response [11\u201313], etc. In the synthesis process of these complexes, the type of structure changes dramatically from simple to complicated topologies or from low to high order winding. After the efforts of previous scientists, the synthesis of initial macrocyclic compounds has evolved from [2] catenane compounds to Solomon, Borromean ring and [5] catenane structures, which have been well demonstrated by Sauvage, Stoddart, Fujita and Jin, etc. [14\u201323], marking the rapid development of the research field. At the same time, molecular knots and ravel have also experienced a rapid forward process. Studies from the original synthesis of trefoil knots have evolved to the construction of intricate knots and ravels in more than five crossings, including a pentafoil knot; +31 #+31 #+31 composite knot; granny knot and 818, 52, 71, and 91 knots [24\u201329]. These results pushed synthetic chemistry to a more sophisticated level. In addition, some non-intercable ring-in-ring structures and Russian doll assemblies are also continuously constructed to fill the scope of these exquisite topologies. Accompanied by the pursuit of the synthesis of these structures, structural transformations were explored by guest-, solvent- and metal ion-induced effects plus some chemical reactivity, etc., making it possible to synthesize some difficult compounds.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6826. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28196826 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6826 2 of 13\nScientists are also examining the properties of and applications for these complicated compounds. Some studies of organometallic macrocycle [30\u201333], cage [34\u201336], catenanes on luminescence [37\u201339], host\u2013guest chemistry [40\u201342], separation [43\u201345], chiral resolution and catalysis [46\u201348] have made good progress. Professor Han proposed a new strategy to synthesize various carbinyl macrocyclic compounds and acquired some [2+2] cycloaddition organic products [49\u201351]. Zhang group synthesized a series of Pt2+ and Pd2+ based metal\u2013organic cage compounds and investigated their aggregation-induced luminescence properties [38,39]. All these studies have played a great role in promoting research in this field. Among the compounds constructed, a synthesis and property study of molecular handcuff compounds have been less explored due to the spatial effect of the interior structure, which makes the design difficult. Therefore, achieving synthesis and performing the property study of molecular handcuffs is significantly challenging. Half-sandwich fragments have shown obvious advantages in the synthesis of supramolecular compounds due to their good solubility, crystallinity and directional coordination features. A series of specific supramolecular structures have been successfully synthesized, such as Borromean rings, Solomon links, [2\u20135] catenanes, 4-ravel and various knots [12,15,17\u201319,21,31]. Therefore, choosing appropriate organic linkers and half-sandwich building blocks with specific sizes might enable the construction of molecular handcuffs. In addition, the fluorescence quenching effect of half-sandwich fragments and the different intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions possibly induce strong photothermal conversion properties. L1, a tetradentate pyridine ligand, was chosen. In it, the central olefinic bond unit can keep 4 pyridine units in the same plane and generates a particular twist. The characteristics of a 3-pyridine unit could facilitate the coordination of 2 pyridine sites in the same ligand with half-sandwich metal ions, providing the conditions for the formation of molecular handcuffs. Here, a series of organometallic molecular handcuffs based on B1\u2013B5 building blocks bearing different lateral width and longitudinal dimensions were successfully constructed (Scheme 1). Structures were clearly confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR spectra. Additionally, photothermal conversion experiments have shown that these structures have different photothermal conversion properties due to differences in the size and conjugation effect of the building blocks B1, B2, B3 and B4. Compound 4 exhibited a remarkable photothermal conversion performance.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 2\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0

Viewed from the side, the two molecular clips E1 are placed in a trans configuration, generating a Z-shaped structure. F rthermore, the stacking pattern analysis revealed no interactions between the molecules, suggesting that individual discrete molecules can be stable. Additionally, the presence of molecular handcuffs 1 under solution conditions were also demonstrated by the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 2), accompanied by the combination of 1H-1H COSY NMR and 1H-1H DOSY NMR spectra (Figure 3a,b). Two obvious coupled double peaks could be observed at 8.64 and 8.11 ppm in complex 1, and it displayed an obvious coupling interaction with the triplet at 7.58 ppm, which belonged to the a, b, c positions of the meta-position pyridine group of L1. Two phenyl proton signals\u2014e, f\u2014could be found at 7.35, 7.21 ppm and 8.68 ppm.

            "text": "The molecular handcuff structure 1 prompts us to explore whether increasing the width of a Cp*-based building block can induce the difference in topological structure. Therefore, building blocks B2 and B3 were individually introduced into the system to carry out a reaction with ligand L1. Once the two reaction processes were completed, the NMR exploration experiments of complexes 2 and 3 were performed. The 1H NMR of complex 1 exhibited a clear set of proton signals (Figure 5), which were analyzed through the combination with the two-dimensional spectra of 1H-1H COSY NMR and 1H-1H DOSY NMR (Figure 6a,b). Two doublet signals at 8.68 ppm and 8.05 ppm were clearly observed, which had an obvious coupling effect with the same triplet at 7.57 ppm. Thus, the three signals belonged to the pyridinyl protons of ligand L1. A pair of coupled doublets at 7.01 ppm and a singlet in 6.90 ppm were due to the pyridinyl and phenyl protons of L1.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6826 5 of 13\nIn addition, a doublet at 7.26 ppm without coupling with other protons and two coupling multiple peaks at 8.73 and 8.02 ppm were due to the phenyl protons of the E2 building units. The chemical shift of the Cp* proton was at 1.73 ppm. A single diffusion coefficient from the 1H-1H DOSY NMR spectrum (2.88 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm2s\u22121) further demonstrated the presence of complex 2 (Figure 6b).

Most proton conditions were similar to those in compounds 1 and 2, demonstrating the formation of molecular handcuffs 3 (Figures 1\u20133).

The 1H NMR of complex 4 displaye a set of clear proton signals (Figure 7), which were determined by the utilization of the tw -dimensional sp ctra of 1H-1H COSY NMR and 1H-1H DOSY NMR (Figure 8a,b). A triplet at 7.59 ppm has obvious coupling interactions with two doublets at 8.65 and 8.10 ppm, which is consistent with the three adjacent proton environments of the meta-position pyridine group of L1; these protons could be attributed to the a, b, c positions of the pyridine unit. In addition, two doublets at 7.34 and 7.22 ppm with coupling interactions belonged to e, f of the phenyl unit. Additionally, two strong singlets in the aromatic region could be found at 8.68 and 8.57 ppm. Furthermore, the signals of the NDI unit and Cp* group in building block B4 could be located at 8.88 and 1.82 ppm (Figure 6). The 1H DOSY NMR spectrum of 4 obviously exhibited that these signals for the aromatic and Cp* units displayed a single diffusion coefficient (2.34 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm2s\u22121), further determining the stable presence of 4 (Figure 8b).\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nN N\nNN\nRh O O\nO O\nRh\nN O N O Cu H2O\nRh OO\nOO Rh\nNO\nNO CuH2O\n4+ 4OTf\nRh O O\nO O\nRh\nN O N O Cu H2O\nCl\nCl\n2AgOTf, -2AgCl, L1\nrt\nB5 Molecular handcuffs 5\nN\nN\nO\nO\nO O\nRh\nO O\nRh\nCl\nCl\nN N\nNN\n4+ 4OTf\n2AgOTf, -2AgCl, L1\nrt\nMolecular handcuffs 4\nN\nN\nO\nO\nOO\nRh\nO O Rh\nN\nN\nO\nO\nO O\nRh\nOO Rh\nB4\n\u00a0 Scheme\u00a03.\u00a0The\u00a0synthesis\u00a0of\u00a0handcuffs\u00a04\u00a0and\u00a0heterometallic\u00a0handcuffs\u00a05.\u00a0\nComplex\u00a04\u00a0was\u00a0dissolved\u00a0 in\u00a0deuterated\u00a0methanol\u00a0to\u00a0explore\u00a0 its\u00a0solution\u00a0behavior.\u00a0 The\u00a01H\u00a0NMR\u00a0of\u00a0complex\u00a04\u00a0displayed\u00a0a\u00a0set\u00a0of\u00a0clear\u00a0proton\u00a0signals\u00a0(Figure\u00a07),\u00a0which\u00a0were\u00a0 determined\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0utilization\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0two-dimensional\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a01H-1H\u00a0COSY\u00a0NMR\u00a0and\u00a0 1H-1H\u00a0DOSY\u00a0NMR\u00a0(Figure\u00a08a,b).\u00a0A\u00a0triplet\u00a0at\u00a07.59\u00a0ppm\u00a0has\u00a0obvious\u00a0coupling\u00a0interactions\u00a0 with\u00a0two\u00a0doublets\u00a0at\u00a08.65\u00a0and\u00a08.10\u00a0pp ,\u00a0 hich\u00a0is\u00a0consistent\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0three\u00a0adjacent\u00a0proton\u00a0 environments\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0meta- siti \u00a0 ri i e\u00a0group\u00a0of\u00a0L1;\u00a0these\u00a0protons\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0attributed\u00a0 to\u00a0the\u00a0a,\u00a0b,\u00a0c\u00a0positions\u00a0of\u00a0t e\u00a0 i i \u00a0 it.\u00a0I \u00a0addition,\u00a0two\u00a0doublets\u00a0at\u00a07.34\u00a0and\u00a07.22\u00a0ppm\u00a0 with\u00a0coupling\u00a0 interactions\u00a0 \u00a0 ,\u00a0f\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0phenyl\u00a0unit.\u00a0A ditionally,\u00a0two\u00a0strong\u00a0 singlets\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0aromatic\u00a0re i \u00a0 f nd\u00a0at\u00a08.68\u00a0and\u00a08.57\u00a0 pm.\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0 the\u00a0 signals\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0NDI\u00a0unit\u00a0an \u00a0 \u00a0i \u00a0 ilding\u00a0block\u00a0B4\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0located\u00a0at\u00a08.88\u00a0and\u00a0 1.82\u00a0p m\u00a0 (Figure\u00a06).\u00a0The\u00a0 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a04\u00a0obviously\u00a0exhibited\u00a0 that\u00a0 these\u00a0 signals\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0aromatic\u00a0a \u00a0 *\u00a0 its\u00a0 is layed\u00a0a\u00a0single\u00a0diffusion\u00a0coefficient\u00a0(2.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0 cm2s\u22121),\u00a0further\u00a0deter ining\u00a0the\u00a0stable\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a04\u00a0(Figure\u00a08b).\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a07.\u00a0The\u00a01H\u00a0NMR\u00a0(500\u00a0MHz,\u00a0CD3OD,\u00a0ppm)\u00a0for\u00a02\u00a0(7.0\u00a0mM,\u00a0with\u00a0respect\u00a0to\u00a0Cp*Rh).\u00a0Figure 7.

The longest distance of Rh\u2013Rh was 16.17 \u00c5, which is similar to the distances of complexes 1 and 2. Careful observation revealed that an obvious accumulation effect (3.48 \u00c5) between Cp* and the phenyl group could be observed, reflecting strong intermolecular interactions. These interactions caused the formation of two-dimensional layered structures. (Figure 9)."

            "text": "Photothermal materials are widely used in the fields of photothermal therapy, photothermal imaging and photothermal sensors [52,53]. Previous research showed that half-sandwich structures have a very strong light quenching effect. The dark appearance and near infrared absorption of these half-sandwich-based molecular handcuffs prompted us to investigate their photothermal conversion performance, which have also attracted more and more attention of scientists [54]. First, the solid UV-visible spectra of complexes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were recorded (Figure 10a). Results showed a set of obvious near infrared absorption: 0.84, 0.70, 0.74, 1.0 and 0.22 at 730 nm for complexes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Analyzing these absorption values carefully, we could find that complexes 4 and 5 showed the strongest and weakest near infrared absorption, which are related to their conjugation effect and copper ion coordination characteristics. This might have resulted in the strongest and weakest photothermal conversion effect. Meanwhile, a similar absorption value of complexes 1, 2, 3 could be attributed to their close conjugation effect. These near infrared absorption values could generate a corresponding NIR photothermal conversion ability. Subsequently, the NIR photothermal conversion studies for complexes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were separately carried out. And the photothermal conversion curves of these complexes showed a specific heating process. The temperature of complex 1 under 0.6 W/cm2 laser irradiation at a 730 nm wavelength displayed a significant increase at 9.5 \u25e6C (from 26.7 to 36.2 \u25e6C, Figure 10b). Meanwhile, the observed temperature changes for complexes 2 (from 27.4 to 43.6 \u25e6C) and 3 (from 27.4 to 35.8 \u25e6C) are similar to that recorded for complex 1. Importantly, an obvious stronger photothermal conversion could be observed for molecular handcuffs 4. Thus, a temperature increase of 26.7 \u25e6C (from 27.7 to 54.4 \u25e6C) in 230 s under a power irradiation (0.15 W/cm2, Figure 10b), which could be due to the suitable conjugation effect of building block B4, resulted in the strongest near infrared (NIR) absorption (1.0) at\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6826 9 of 13\n730 nm and intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions, leading to a good NIR photothermal conversion effect. Nevertheless, just as we expected, the weak near infrared absorption (0.22) at 730 nm and poor intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions in complex 5 resulted in a very small temperature change of about 6.4 \u25e6C (from 26.2 \u25e6C to 32.4 \u25e6C), which was consistent with our initial speculation.

Results showed that accompanied by the increase in laser power per unit area from 0.15 to 0.45 W/cm2, temperature change increased accordingly (Figure 11b). Specifically, when the power per unit area was 0.45 W/cm2, the temperature change of complex 4 could reach 55.7 \u25e6C (from 28.7 \u25e6C to 84.4 \u25e6C), suggesting that in a special near infrared light region, the increase in laser power per unit area could result in the enhancing of the photothermal conversion performance.

            "text": "In summary, a series of organometallic molecular handcuffs bearing different sizes and species of metal atoms were successfully acquired through the self-assembly of quadridentate pyridyl ligand L1 and the five Cp*Rh based building blocks B1, B2, B3, B4 and B5. The change of the width and length of building blocks did not cause the change of the type of molecular handcuffs. And, these complexes were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, NMR spectra and UV\u2013Vis spectra. Interestingly, the photothermal conversion studies for these complexes are carefully performed, reflecting different photothermal conversion capacities. Discrepancy in photothermal conversion comes from the different conjugative effects of building blocks B1\u2013B5. A strong conjugation effect and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions induced good ph tothermal conversion result . We believe that our results may be useful for constructing va ious Cp*-based photothermal conversion materials nd promoting the rapid development of fine materials and smart materials.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6826 11 of 13\nAuthor Contributions: X.L. and J.-J.H.: synthesis of the title complexes, formal analysis.
