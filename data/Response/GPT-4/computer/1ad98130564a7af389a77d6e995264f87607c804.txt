Exploring Advanced Deep Learning Models: Investigating the integration of more sophisticated deep learning models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Transformer-based architectures, with handcrafted features. These models could offer improved learning capabilities for complex data patterns, potentially leading to better segmentation accuracy and generalizability.

Multi-modal Data Fusion for Segmentation: Expanding the hybrid approach to incorporate additional modalities of medical imaging data, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans or Computed Tomography (CT) scans, along with MRI. This could help in capturing a more comprehensive view of the tumor and its microenvironment, improving the segmentation performance further.

Attention Mechanisms and Feature Fusion Techniques: Implementing attention mechanisms, such as self-attention or convolutional block attention module (CBAM), to enhance feature extraction and selection in both CNN and handcrafted feature pathways. Additionally, exploring novel feature fusion techniques to optimally combine handcrafted and learned features at different stages of the model could yield better segmentation outcomes.

Automated Feature Engineering and Selection: Developing methods for automated handcrafted feature engineering and selection to identify the most relevant features for brain tumor segmentation without extensive manual tuning. Machine learning techniques like AutoML or evolutionary algorithms could be employed to streamline this process, making the hybrid model more efficient and adaptable.

Cross-institutional and Cross-protocol Generalizability Studies: Conducting extensive validation studies of the proposed hybrid model across different institutions, MRI scanners, and imaging protocols to assess and enhance its generalizability. This could involve developing domain adaptation techniques to minimize performance degradation when applied to new, unseen data from diverse sources.
