    "abstractText": "Costly punishment describes decisions of an interaction partner to punish an opponent for violating rules of fairness at the expense of personal costs. Here, we extend the interaction process by investigating the impact of a socio-emotional reaction of the opponent in response to the punishment that indicates whether punishment was successful or not. In a modified Ultimatum game, emotional facial expressions of the proposer in response to the decision of the responder served as feedback stimuli. We found that both honored reward following acceptance of an offer (smiling compared to neutral facial expression) and successful punishment (sad compared to neutral facial expression) elicited a reward positivity, indicating that punishment was the intended outcome. By comparing the pattern of results with a probabilistic learning task, we show that the reward positivity on sad facial expressions was specific for the context of costly punishment. Additionally, acceptance rates on a trial-by-trial basis were altered according to P3 amplitudes in response to the emotional facial reaction of the proposer. Our results are in line with the concept of costly punishment as an intentional act following norm-violating behavior. Socio-emotional stimuli have an important influence on the perception and behavior in economic bargaining.",

Here, we extend the interaction process by investigating the impact of a socio-emotional reaction of the opponent in response to the punishment that indicates whether punishment was successful or not. In a modified Ultimatum game, emotional facial expressions of the proposer in response to the decision of the responder served as feedback stimuli. We found that both honored reward following acceptance of an offer (smiling compared to neutral facial expression) and successful punishment (sad compared to neutral facial expression) elicited a reward positivity, indicating that punishment was the intended outcome. By comparing the pattern of results with a probabilistic learning task, we show that the reward positivity on sad facial expressions was specific for the context of costly punishment. Additionally, acceptance rates on a trial-by-trial basis were altered according to P3 amplitudes in response to the emotional facial reaction of the proposer. Our results are in line with the concept of costly punishment as an intentional act following norm-violating behavior. Socio-emotional stimuli have an important influence on the perception and behavior in economic bargaining.\nKey words: costly punishment; Ultimatum game; feedback-related negativity; emotional facial expressions; altruism"

            "text": "Economic bargaining between two individuals is a highly complex social interaction. While economic theories like rational choice theory (Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944) aim to explain such behavior as a function of maximizing personal utility in terms of monetary gain, research on social, cognitive and neurophysiological variables has altered this traditional view. For example, fairness considerations (Boksem and De Cremer, 2010), emotional states (Mussel et al., 2013), personality (Thielmann et al., 2020), gender (Flinkenfloger et al., 2017) or attractiveness (Ma et al., 2015) have been found to influence economic decision-making beyond personal utility. In the present study, we contribute to this literature by investigating social-emotional variables in an extended bargaining process and their neural representation as predictors of behavior in future decisions.\nThe Ultimatum game (G\u00fcth et al., 1982) is an often-used paradigm to investigate decision-making in an economic setting (de Quervain et al., 2004; Strobel et al., 2011). While research on social-cognitive and neural mechanisms typically focused on the decision of the proposer (Weiland et al., 2012; Rodrigues et al., 2015) or the responder (Sanfey et al., 2003; Polezzi et al., 2008), Mussel et al. (2018) extended the interaction process between the\ntwo partners. After the decision of the responder, the proposer indicated how he or she felt considering the decision of the responder by sending a socio-emotional cue (a picture with an emotional facial expression). Acceptance rates were altered for offers from proposers who responded in a characteristic way according to the decision of the responder. On the neural level, smiling facial expressions after acceptance elicited a reward positivity in the time frame of the N2 component, indicating that events are better than expected (Gehring and Willoughby, 2002; Holroyd and Coles, 2002; Hajcak et al., 2005; Holroyd et al., 2008; Baker and Holroyd, 2011). Interestingly, the sad compared to neutral facial expression after rejection also elicited a reward positivity. As negative compared to positive emotional facial expressions usually elicit a feedback-related negativity (FRN) (Miltner et al., 1997), this effect was labeled as reversed FRN. It can be interpreted that the rejection of an unfair offer indicates costly punishment (Henrich et al., 2006; Rodrigues et al., 2020), and the sad facial expression following rejection indicated that punishment was successful. Thus, the smile upon acceptance indicated honored reward and the sad face upon rejection successful punishment. Both are accompanied by a reward positivity in the FRN and higher acceptance rates in upcoming trials.\nReceived: 10 February 2021; Revised: 20 September 2021; Accepted: 4 November 2021\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The reversed FRN effect was not replicated in studies using a block-wise design (Wei\u00df et al., 2019a,b). In those studies, proposers reacted with a contingent facial feedback in response to the decision of the responders across all trials within a block. Thus, the feedback was highly expectable and may thus not have been processed as surprising (Alexander and Brown, 2011) or better or worse than expected (Holroyd and Coles, 2002).\nIn the present study, we extended this line of research by investigating the effects of successful punishment on a trial-by-trial basis (Osinsky et al., 2012). We also used a block-wise design. However, rather than creating types of proposers reacting with a fixed pattern according to the decision of the responder, we implemented probabilistic contingencies and investigated effects on decision-making. We investigated acceptance rates in trial n+1 as well as neural responses following the emotional facial expression (N170, FRN and P3). We expected to replicate the reversed FRN for sad compared to neutral faces. Our main hypothesis is that successful punishment (sad compared to neutral after rejection) as well as rewarded non-punishment (smile compared to neutral after acceptance), including their neural representations, predict higher acceptance rates in trial n+1."

Next, three pictures were taken from each participant, each with either a smiling, neutral or sad facial expression. These pictureswere used in Task 2 (see below). Additionally, to make the cover story as realistic as possible, they were told that the offers they see in Task 3 (our main task) are from participants who participated in the experiment earlier, and that their pictures would be used accordingly in the future. However, pictures were taken from a standardized set (Langner et al., 2010) and offers were predefined. The pictures were deleted after the experiment, following a debriefing of the participants.\nNext, they were given a reinforcement learning task as a reference task to measure neural responses to facial stimuli in a non-costly-punishment setting (Task 1). Due to space restrictions, this task is described in detail in Supplementary Online Material.\nFollowing this task, participants played a modified Ultimatum game in the role of the proposer (Task 2). The purpose of this task was mainly to familiarize the participant with the main experiment and to enhance the plausibility of the cover story. On each of 10 trials, participants made a decision on how many cents (0 to 5 from a total of 10) to offer to his or her partner (see Figure 1A). The decisionwas visualized as a pie chart. Next, the partner decided to accept or reject the offer. The participantswere told that decisions were made by former participants. Unknown to the participant, decisions were predefinedwith a 100% probability to accept for an offer of 5 cents, continually decreasing to 0% for an offer of 0 cent. Next, the participant had the option to react to the decision of the partner by sending a smiling, sad or neutral facial expression of himself or herself. The pictures contained the images of the participants that were made prior to the experiment. The chosen facial expression was briefly shown as a confirmation.\nIn Task 3, the main task, participants played the modified Ultimatum game in the role of the receiver (see Figure 1B). There were eight blocks, each played against a different proposer (four female and four male proposers), presented in randomized order. Each block consisted of 48 trials (6 offer levels presented 8 times each), also presented in randomized order (approximately 35min). Each trial started with the offer of the proposer, ranging from 0 to 5 cents from a total of 10 cents. The offer was displayed as a pie chart. The participants decided to either accept or reject the offer, and the decisionwas briefly confirmed. Next, the participants saw a facial expression in response to their decision. After an accepted offer, either a neutral or a smiling facial expression was shown with a probability of 50% each, respectively. After a rejected offer, either a neutral or a sad facial expressionwas shownwith a probability of 50% each, respectively. As noted above, participants were told that offers and facial expressions in response to the decision were collected from other participants who played the Ultimatum game earlier (as they didwhen playing the Ultimatum game in the role of the proposer).\nAll stimuli were presented on a 17\u2032\u2032 screen with a grey background. Stimulus presentation and response recordings were controlled by PsychoPy v2020.1.3 (Peirce, 2008). During the task, participants were seated in a comfortable chair with a distance about 70 cm between the head and the screen. Each of the face\nFig. 1.

During recording, impedanceswere kept below 10k\u2126 and electrodeswere referenced to FCz. Data were processed offline, using MATLAB R2018b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and the Toolbox EEGLAB v2019.1 (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). First, data were re-referenced to the average across scalp electrodes and electrode FCz was reinstated. Data were then epoched from \u2212800 to 1200ms around the target stimulus (presentation of the facial expression or offer) and baseline-corrected (baseline from \u2212200 to 0ms). Channels (excluding FP1 and FP2) containing artifacts were rejected according to joint probability using a criterion of z=3.29. Next data were high-pass filtered with 1Hz. A first independent component analysis (ICA) was performed for trial rejection. Trials exceeding the criterion of z=3.29 for joint probability or kurtosis (on all channels excluding FP1 and FP2) were excluded (1% of the trials). A second ICA was performed on the remaining trials. Artifacts were detected using the MARA plugin (Winkler et al., 2014). The ICA solution was written to the unfiltered data, and components containing artifacts were automatically rejected. Next, excluded channels were interpolated, and the data were low-pass filtered at 20Hz (Rodrigues et al., 2021)."

            "text": "We investigated neural correlates of the decision-making process according to the presentation of emotional facial expressions in Task 3. For each stimulus, we quantified the N170, FRN, P3 amplitudes and theta power for each participant and each trial (see Figure 2).\nThe N170 is an event-related potential, occurring \u223c170ms after visual processing of human faces at occipito-temporal electrode positions (Bentin et al., 1996; Eimer, 2000; Rossion et al., 2000). It originates in the fusiform gyri (Pizzagalli et al., 2002) and is sensitive to the facial-emotional expression of faces (Hinojosa et al., 2015). We quantified the N170 as the mean amplitude in the time window between 140 and 176ms according to the grand average at electrodes TP9 and TP10 and according to visual\ninspection of the ERP. The voltage at the two electrodes was subsequently averaged.\nThe FRN is a negative deflection in the event-related potential, \u223c200\u2013350ms following negative compared to positive feedback at fronto-central electrode positions (Miltner et al., 1997). It is elicited due to a phasic decrease in dopaminergic signaling in basal ganglia, followed by a disinhibition of apical dendrites of the motor neurons of the anterior cingulate cortex (Debener et al., 2005). More positive amplitudes have been interpreted against the background of reinforcement learning as temporal difference error (Sutton and Barto, 1998), that is events that are better than expected (Holroyd and Coles, 2002; Baker and Holroyd, 2011). We quantified the FRN as themean amplitude in the interval between 224 and 344ms according to the grand average and according to the visual inspection of the ERP.1\nThe P3 component typically peaks between 350 and 600ms and has a positive maximum over parietal electrode sides (Sutton et al., 1965). It has been found to be sensitive to the magnitude of reward (Yeung and Sanfey, 2004), to the motivational relevance of stimuli (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005) and, according to more recent studies, also to the valence of the reward, with more positive amplitudes for positive compared to negative stimuli (Bellebaum and Daum, 2008; Kreussel et al., 2012). Processes reflected by the P3 have been interpreted as contributing to behavioral adjustment to stimuli from the environment (Bouret and Sara, 2004; Dayan and Yu, 2006). The neural source of the P3 component is less well known and is probably distributed over different regions of the cortex, most likely including the temporal-parietal junction and the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system (San Mart\u00edn, 2012). The P3 was quantified as the mean amplitude between 456 and 588ms at electrode Pz according to the grand average and according to visual inspection of the ERP.2\nTheta oscillations have been shown to reflect ongoing cognitive processes related to different cognitive tasks, including working memory, executive control and short-term memory load (Kahana et al., 1999; Jensen and Tesche, 2002; Rutishauser et al., 2010; Anguera et al., 2013) Theta power is sensitive to percepts associated with reward and punishment and has thus been proposed as an alternative indicator of feedback processing (Cohen et al., 2008). Theta power was obtained by performing a wavelet-analysis based on Cohen (2014) using the function wavelet_power_2 (Rodrigues et al., 2021). The frequency\n1 Visual inspection of the lower and upper time limits of the ERP components, rather thanmean around the peak, was chosen due to the asymmetrical shape of the FRN (see Figure 2).\n2 The early peak at 324ms was identified as the negative dipole of the N2. See also Supplementary Figure S2 for the ERP of the reference task, for which the same time range was used.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /scan/article/17/6/590/6514979 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nband was set to 4\u20138Hz using 3.5 cycles. Data were transformed to decibel by computing 10 times the common logarithm of the power. We quantified the average power between 100 and 500ms following the stimulus at FCz and subtracted the baseline power between \u2212300 and \u2212100ms relative to the stimulus. To our surprise, theta power was not sensitive to feedback valence. As such, neither fair compared to unfair offers in the Ultimatum game (F=0.02, P=0.88) nor smiling compared to neutral facial feedback (F=0.001, P=0.98) elicited a corresponding response. Thus, modulation of the feedback response in the context of successful punishment is meaningless as, in the present study, the measure was not sensitive to feedback per se. Given these results and recent evidence that FRN and theta are functionally dissociated (Rodrigues et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), we refrain from conducting further analyses on theta power."

            "text": "When playing the modified Ultimatum game as a proposer, participants offered on average 3.7 cents. If their offer was accepted, they responded with a smiling facial expression in 91% of trials, and with a neutral expression in the remaining 9%. A sad facial expression was never chosen. If their offer was rejected, they responded with a sad facial expression in 58% and with a neutral expression in 40% of the trials. A smiling expression was chosen in only 2% of the trials.\nWhen playing the Ultimatum game as a responder, the average number of trials were 110, 106, 82, and 82 trials for the conditions of accept-smile, accept-neutral, reject-neutral and reject-sad, respectively. For decision to accept or reject an offer in the Ultimatum game, higher offers resulted in higher acceptance rates (F=945, df=5, P<0.001): for offers rising from 0 to 5 (out of 5)\ncents, acceptance rates were 15%, 21%, 36%, 77%, 93% and 99%, respectively. A significant effect for trial number (F=127, df=1, \u03b2=0.25, P<0.001) and the interaction between trial number and offer size (F=4.5, df=5, P<0.001) indicated that acceptance rates increased during the game (estimate 0.25), especially for offers of 3 cents or less.\nFor N170 amplitudes following the facial feedback, results revealed a significant interaction between facial feedback and decision (F=14.5, df=1, \u03b2=0.36, P<0.001). The pattern of the effect can be interpreted as arousal effect, with more negative amplitudes for the emotional (accept-smile; reject-sad) compared to neutral (accept-neutral; reject-neutral, all \u03b2>0.20, t>1.9, P<0.05) facial feedback. A similar effect was found for the reference task 1 (see Supplementary Online Material). No other effects were significant.\nFor the FRN, we also found a significant interaction between facial feedback and decision (F=81, df=1, \u03b2=\u22121.80, P<0.001). Interestingly, both the sad facial expression after rejection and the smiling facial expression after acceptance elicited a feedback positivity which was significantly different from the neutral facial expression after both rejection and acceptance (P<0.001, see Figures 2B and 3A). In contrast to the reference task, where sad facial expressions elicited more negative values compared to smiling facial expressions (see Supplementary Online Material), there was no significant difference between these two expressions in the context of the Ultimatum (P=0.81), yielding support for a reversed FRN that might indicate successful punishment. No other effects revealed significance. Direct comparisons between the reference task and the main task can be found in the Supplemental Online Material A.\nWe found no effect of face or decision on P3 amplitudes. In the reference task, sad compared to smiling facial expressions elicited stronger P3 amplitudes (see Supplemental Online Material A), whichmay reflect behavioral adjustment. In the context of the Ultimatum game, there was no significant difference between these facial expressions reflecting honored reward and successful punishment. However, we note that descriptively results were in the expected direction (higher P3 amplitudes following successful punishment and honored reward, compared to the neutral facial expressions, respectively). Additionally, exploratory post hoc analyses that we report in Supplemental Material Online B show that the effect was significant when controlling for dynamic states during the game. Particularly, it can be interpreted that the effect is larger in trials in which participants are actively engaged in the game.\nFig. 3.

Higher acceptance rates in trial n predicted higher acceptance rates in trial n+1. Descriptively, pressing \u2018accept\u2019 two times in a row is more likely (36%) compared to switching from \u2018accept\u2019 to \u2018reject\u2019 or vice versa (both 21%) or pressing \u2018reject\u2019 two times in a row (22%).3 Our hypotheses posited that honored reward (smile after accept) and successful punishment (sad after reject) compared to non-honored reward (neutral after acceptance) and non-successful punishment (neutral after rejection) leads to higher acceptance rates in trail n+1. While there was a tendency in the expected direction (see Figure 3B), the corresponding interaction between decision in trial n and facial feedback did not reach significance (F=2.3, df=1,\u03b2=\u2212.09, P=0.13).\nIn our brain-behavior analyses, we found no significant effect of the FRN on decision-making on trial n+1, nor for any interaction with decision in trail n or facial feedback. For amplitudes in the P3, we found a significant main effect (F=4.5, df=1, \u03b2=\u22120.03, P=0.03), indicating that higher amplitudes on the P3 in trial n predicted lower acceptance rates in trial n+1. This effect was qualified by a three-way interaction between amplitudes of the P3, decision in trail n and facial feedback (F=4.9; df=1, \u03b2=\u2212.13, P=0.03). As illustrated in Figure 4, the negative effect of P3 on decision-making in trial n+1 (higher P3 amplitudes predicting lower acceptance rates) was due to trials of non-honored reward (neutral after acceptance) as well as non-successful punishment (neutral after rejection). On the contrary, the effect vanishes for honored reward (smiling after acceptance) and is even reversed for successful punishment (sad after rejection)."

            "text": "Economic bargaining is a complex social interaction. In line with this premise, we confirmed an influence of socio-emotional variables on economic decision-making. As a novelty of the present study, we combined the socio-emotional reaction of the proposer in an extended Ultimatum game with sequence effects in trialby-trial experiments (Osinsky et al., 2012). As key findings of this study, our results (i) replicate the reversed FRN effect, (ii) resolve a discrepancy in the literature regarding successful punishment effects in block-wise designs and (iii) show that decision-making\n3 This effect might reflect acceptance rates >50% on average, increasing acceptance rates during the game or response patterns, such as inconsiderate acceptance of multiple offers in a row.\nin the upcoming trial is predicted by the neural representation of successful punishment.\nThe reversed FRN effect as an indicator of successful punishment was first reported by Mussel et al. (2018). The study implemented proposers with different identities (the specific emotional facial expressions according to the decision of the responder), which were indicated at the beginning of each trial in the form of a picture of the proposer with a neutral facial expression. Results revealed amain effect between the smiling identity (smiling upon acceptance, neutral facial expression upon rejection) compared to a neutral identity (neutral facial expression following both acceptance and rejection). However, in two studies using a block-wise design, this effect was not supported (Wei\u00df et al., 2019a,b). In the latter two studies, the picture of the proposer with a neutral facial expression at the beginning of a trial was omitted; rather, receivers played a whole block against a proposer with a certain identity who showed a contingent facial expression upon the decision of the responder. Thus, the reaction of the proposer was easy to learn after a few trials, and thus, fully predictable, which might explain the lack of a reward positivity effect. In the present study, participants also played a full block with the same proposer. However, emotional facial feedback was probabilistic (50%) and, thus, not predictable. We found a significant reversed FRN effect suggesting that not the block-wise design per se, but the lack of prediction error was responsible for the conflicting results in the past. The lacking reversed FRN effect might thus be due to the fact that the feedback was fully anticipated (Schultz et al., 1997).\nThe reversed FRN effect provides support for the concept of costly punishment. The rejection of an unfair offer can thus be interpreted as an intentional act to punish the proposer. The sad facial expression of the proposer upon rejection might signal that the punishment was understood, or the proposer feels sorry. The reward positivity elicited by this emotional facial cue shows that it was the desired and intended outcome and that punishment was successful (see Fehr and Ga\u0308chter, 2002; de Quervain et al., 2004; Strobel et al., 2011; Mothes et al., 2016).\nWe found that acceptance rates in the next trial were predicted by the neurophysiological representation of successful punishment. In line with existing evidence (Mussel et al., 2018), processes occurring in the time frame of the P3 (rather than earlier components) were relevant for predicting subsequent behavior. Particularly, for our expected effect of higher acceptance rates after successful and lower acceptance rates after non-successful punishment, we only found a non-significant tendency in the expected direction. However, P3 amplitudes according to successful and non-successful punishment predicted acceptance rates in trial n+1 in the expected direction. Particularly, higher compared to lower P3 amplitudes were followed by decreased acceptance rates after non-honored reward and non-successful punishment and by increased acceptance rates after successful costly punishment. This also suggests that emotional facial expressions only impact subsequent behavior when the stimulus is actually interpreted as a signal for successful punishment, as indicated by high compared to low P3 amplitudes.\nWe note that there is a discrepancy in the reported effects regarding the component that reflects the effects of successful punishment and honored reward. Whereas the emotional facial expression had an impact on the FRN, amplitudes in the time range and topography of the P3 predicted subsequent behavior. In contributing to resolving this discrepancy, we note the following: first, there was a tendency of an effect of emotional facial expressions on P3 amplitudes which became significant when\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /scan/article/17/6/590/6514979 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\ncontrolling for (whatwe interpreted as) current engagement in the task. The latter results, described in detail in the supplemental material, are exploratory post hoc analyses that must be treated with caution. Yet, they provide initial evidence that the P3 component was also affected by the facial expressions, even though in amore complicated way than expected. Second, our results are in line with prior research. Mussel et al. (2018) found, in the same vein, an effect of facial expression on the FRN, whereas P3 amplitudes (in their study following the picture of the proposer with a neutral facial expression) predicted subsequent acceptance rates.\nIn integrating this pattern of results, we propose the following description of the temporal course underlying the processing of the emotional feedback. In the time frame of the N170, facial cues are interpreted regarding their emotional facial expression, as mirrored in equivalent patterns in the Ultimatum game and the reference task. In the time course of the N2, these cues are evaluated regarding their valence within their specific context, as evident from altered patterns in the Ultimatum game compared to the reference task. Finally, in the time frame of the P3, processes relating to behavioral adjustment occur as evident in the prediction of behavior in the next trial (Bouret and Sara, 2004; Dayan and Yu, 2006). This implies a complex interplay of multiple neural structures and across time, which leads to differential effects on different ERP components.\nAs a limitation of the present study, we first mention that our sample was not representative for the general population. The higher percentage of female participants might have affected our results, eventually in interaction with the gender of the proposer. As the small number of male participants did not allow for the analysis of gender-specific effects, future research is needed to investigate generalization to the general population. Second, to make the feedback realistic, we did not implement a full design with all facial expressions (smile, neutral and sad) following both acceptance and rejection. Third, we used pre-defined offers and stimuli from a pre-tested set of facial expressions, rather than offers and pictures from other participants. We included Task 2 to enhance the cover story yet cannot rule out that some participants might have suspected that they did not play against a participant. Fourth, the incentive for the participants might have been too small to guarantee high engagement, which might have dampened some of the effects. Yet, we were still able to confirm our hypotheses, which support a reasonable stability of the findings.\nIn sum, our study supports the view of costly punishment as an intentional behavior that can be rewarding. Future decisionmaking depends on whether punishment is perceived as successful or non-successful. This stresses the importance of feedback also in the context of punishment for the punisher, and the rewarding notion may partly explain the costly rule and law reinforcement behavior in society although no personal materialistic gain is involved."
