Patients with AD have a high risk of developing Staphylococcus aureus infection. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD development. Butyrate, a short chain fatty acid known to be produced from the fermentation of glycerol by the commensal skin bacterium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, has been reported to possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that suppress inflammatory dermatoses. However, little is known about the effects of butyrate on dermal IL-33 expression and associated immune response in S. aureus-aggravated skin inflammation in the context of AD. To decipher the underlying mechanism, we established an AD-like mouse model with epidermal barrier disruption by delipidizing the dorsal skin to induce AD-like pathophysiology, followed by the epicutaneous application of S. aureus and butyrate. We discovered that S. aureus infection exacerbated IL-33 release from keratinocytes and aggravated dermal leukocyte infiltration and IL-13 expression. Moreover, we showed that butyrate could attenuate S. aureusaggravated skin inflammation with decreased IL-33, IL-13, and leukocyte infiltration in the skin. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that butyrate suppressed IL-33 expression and ameliorated skin inflammation through histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibition. Overall, our findings revealed the potential positive effect of butyrate in controlling inflammatory skin conditions in AD aggravated by S. aureus infection.\nKEYWORDS\natopic dermatitis, butyrate, histone deacetylase, interleukin 33, keratinocytes, S. aureus, S. epidermidis\nAbbreviations: AD, atopic dermatitis; AEW, acetone and ether followed by water; HDAC, histone deacetylase; SCFAs, short-chain fatty acids; TSA, trichostatin A; WT, wild-type; 4-CMTB, 4-chloro-a-(1-\nmethylethyl)-N-2-thiazolyl-benzeneacetamide.\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "AD is a chronic, relapsing, and inflammatory skin condition with a complex etiology. It is characterized by epidermal thickening and dermal leukocyte infiltration and is mediated by epithelial-derived IL33 and Th2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (1, 2). Studies have reported that secretion of IL-33 by epithelial cells during cellular injury or damage activates type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), T helper 2 cells (Th2), macrophages, and eosinophils to generate a Th2skewed microenvironment (3), leading to the development of Th2 inflammation. To study the disease mechanisms of AD, the establishment of an AD-like mouse model is essential. Recent studies have suggested that skin delipidized by organic solvent mixture (AEW, acetone/ether, and water washing protocol) results in hyper-proliferation of keratinocytes in the basal layer and scratching, the cardinal feature of AD (4, 5).\nThe human skin microbiota harbors a plethora of resident microorganisms of different species. These microorganisms can interact with host cells, as well as the host immune system (3). One such microbe is S. aureus, which is a gram-positive bacterium residing in skin and mucosa. The superficial skin is a major site for S. aureus colonization, which normally resides in 10-20% of healthy individuals (6). Moreover, studies have reported that 80-100% of AD patients are colonized with S. aureus, which is strongly associated with disease severity (7, 8). S. aureus is capable of secreting virulence factors, including biofilm, enterotoxins, and superantigens that are considered as important elements of the vicious cycle of AD (9). Importantly, a disrupted skin barrier increases the susceptibility to S. aureus infection in skin lesions, which is associated with the overexpression of Th2 cytokines in AD patients (8, 10).\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are microbiota-derived metabolites composed of a carboxylic acid moiety and a hydrocarbon tail. SCFAs are produced by microbes in the gut and by skin-commensal bacteria on the skin at low concentrations (11, 12). Studies have shown that SCFAs derived from skin-commensal bacterium S. epidermidis inhibit the overgrowth of an opportunistic pathogen on the skin, Propionibacterium acnes (13, 14). Moreover, the products of S. epidermidis can suppress cutaneous inflammation through a mechanism depending on the toll-like receptor TLR2 (15). SCFAs reportedly also influenced inflammatory disease symptoms. For example, SCFAs could mediate cytokine and chemokine production by leukocytes and epithelial cells through the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors GPR41 and GPR43 and the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) (16). However, the regulatory role of SCFAs on IL-33 expression and skin inflammation in the context of S. aureus infection remains poorly understood.\nAs a previous study has demonstrated that SCFA butyrate, produced from the glycerol fermentation of S. epidermidis in the skin microbiome, could inhibit S. aureus growth (17), and our own previous study on butyrate alone has demonstrated its ability to regulate type 2 innate lymphoid cell function in the context of airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (18), we choose to focus on butyrate to investigate its regulatory role in S. aureus-aggravated skin inflammation.\nFrontiers in Immunology 02"

To perform the delipidization treatment, the organic solvent of acetone and ether mixture (1:1) was applied to the shaved area twice daily for two days (4, 5). For epicutaneous S. aureus infection, 5 \u00d7 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of S. aureuswas suspended in 0.1 mL of TSB and applied to a cotton pad (1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm2), which was then applied onto the dorsal skin of mice for 24 h following delipidization. For intradermal S. aureus infection, C57BL/6 mice were intradermally (i.d.) inoculated into their backs with 107 colony-forming units (CFU) of S. aureus suspended in 0.1 mL of PBS and were sacrificed three days after S. aureus inoculation. For butyrate treatment on S. aureusinfected skin, after delipidization treatment, the dorsal skin of C57BL/ 6 mice was treated with a cotton pad (1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm2) for 24 h with 5 \u00d7 108 CFU of S. aureus that was suspended in 0.1 mL of 1 mMbutyrate.\nTreatment of S. epidermidis glycerol ferment on mouse skin\nGlycerol fermentation by S. epidermidis was performed using a method described in a previous study (17). In brief, C57BL/6 mice subjected to AEW treatment were treated with 50 ul of S. epidermidis\nfrontiersin.org\nor S. aureus (5 \u00d7 108 CFU) individually or simultaneously, in the presence or absence of 2% glycerol, using a cotton pad (1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm2). After 24 h of infection, the dorsal skin of the mice was excised and cut into smaller pieces for cytokine detection.\nMouse skin thickness measurement and histology\nMice dorsal skin was excised and fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Merck) for 24 h, and gradually dehydrated with 50%, 70%, and 90% ethanol (J.T. Baker) for 15 minutes each. The skin samples were embedded in paraffin for further histological analysis. For epidermal thickness, the skin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and measured using an Olympus CX31 microscope (Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan).\nProcessing of mouse skin and preparation of single-cell suspension\nDorsal skin (1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm2) was excised from delipidized mice, cut into smaller pieces, and incubated in 5 mL DMEM containing 1 mg/mL DNase I (Worthington Biochemicals), 0.5 mg/mL collagenase type I (Worthington Biochemicals), and 0.2 mg/mL collagenase type II (Worthington Biochemicals) for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. The digested tissue suspension was then filtered through a 70-mm mesh to obtain a single-cell suspension. The red blood cells in the single-cell suspension were lysed using ACK lysing buffer (Thermo Fisher) before the cells were resuspended in the appropriate buffer for further processing.\nIsolation and culturing of murine primary keratinocytes\nThe murine primary keratinocytes were isolated following an established protocol (19). Briefly, neonates from C57B/6 mice aged 0-2 days were sacrificed, and the limbs removed just above the wrist and ankle joints. The whole skin was then peeled off and incubated in 4.3 mg/mL neutral protease at 4 \u02daC overnight. The next day, forceps were used to separate the epidermis from the dermis, which was then further digested using 0.25 mg/mL trypsin/EDTA to obtain a single suspension of keratinocytes. Freshly isolated keratinocytes were cultured in antibiotic-free progenitor cell targeted medium (CELLnTEC) in 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells in 0.2 mL/well for further experimentation.\nIn vitro infection with S. aureus\nCells were cultured at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL in 96-well plates and infected with S. aureus at 10 MOI (multiplicity of infection) for\nFrontiers in Immunology 03\n24 h. The culture supernatant was then collected for ELISA measurement. For mRNA detection, cells were cultured in antibiotic-free medium at 5 \u00d7 105 cells/mL in 12-well plates and infected with S. aureus at 10 MOI prior to mRNA isolation.\nDetermination of SCFA bactericidal activity\nS. aureus (2\u00d7107 CFU/mL) was incubated with PBS (control) or 1 mM of acetate, butyrate or propionate for 24 h. After incubation, a 10-fold serial dilution from 10-1 to 10-5 was prepared from the treated bacteria, and 5 ml of each dilution was spotted on an agar plate. The bactericidal activity of SCFA was then determined in CFU from the highest dilution that showed bacterial growth."

Therefore, to elucidate the potential role of S. aureus in contributing to the exacerbation of allergic responses during AD, we tested the ability of a S. aureus strain isolated from an AD patient to induce IL-33, as well as two other epithelial cell-derived cytokines, IL-25 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), in the human keratinocyte cell line, KERTr cell. We found that the S. aureus clinical isolate triggered the release of IL-33 in an infection doseand time-dependent manner (Figures 1A, B). Moreover, IL-25 also increased in S. aureus-infected KERTr cells (Figure 1C). However, TSLP was undetectable in S. aureus infected KERTr cells (Figure 1D). A similar effect was observed in primary mouse keratinocytes infected with S. aureus, in which increased IL-33 and IL-25 expression was observed, along with positive TSLP expression (Figures 1E\u2013G)."

            "text": "S. aureus aggravates IL-33 release and skin inflammation\nTo determine whether S. aureus infection could induce IL-33 expression in vivo, we infected C57BL/6 mice with S. aureus by intradermal injection (i.d.). We observed an increase in IL-33 and IL-6 production from S. aureus-infected mice (Figures 2A, B). As a recent study has reported that S. aureus could penetrate through the epidermis into the dermis and trigger the expression of Th2 cytokines (21), we established an AD-like mouse model to mimic the natural route of S. aureus infection in AD patients with skin barrier disruption. This involved applying AEW treatment to mice, followed by epicutaneously challenging them with S. aureus. We discovered that S. aureus infection exacerbated AEW-induced IL-33 and IL-6 expressions in the skin (Figures 2C, D). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Il6 and Il33, as well as the Th2 cytokine Il13, increased substantially in S. aureus-infected skin (Figures 2E\u2013G). However, the level of Th17 cytokine Il17amRNA was undetectable (Figure 2H), and the level of Th1 cytokine IfngmRNA did not change significantly during S. aureus infection (Figure 2I). Overall, these results suggest that S. aureus infection enhances IL-33 induction and aggravates Th2 inflammation in the skin of mice.\nS. epidermidis glycerol ferment suppresses S. aureus-aggravated IL-33\nPrevious studies have reported that SCFAs possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting immunomodulatory roles (17, 22). Therefore, we examined whether S. epidermidis grown in 2% glycerol could suppress S. aureus-induced IL-33 and IL-6 in vivo. C57BL/6 mice subjected first to AEW treatment were epicutaneously challenged with S. epidermidis or S. aureus (5 \u00d7 108 CFU), individually or simultaneously, with or without 2% glycerol. We found that the IL-33 level was reduced when the skin was treated with the two bacteria in the presence of glycerol compared with the treatment\nfrontiersin.org\nwith the two bacteria without glycerol (Figure 3A). However, the expression of IL-6 was not significantly altered by the addition of 2% glycerol (Figure 3B).\nThree SCFAs, acetate, butyrate, and propionate, are known to be produced by the fermentation of glycerol by S. epidermidis (23). Consequently, we investigated the effect of all three SCFAs on cultured keratinocytes following S. aureus infection. We found that all three SCFAs could inhibit IL-33 expression in the KERTr cells (Figure 3C), as well as in the mouse primary keratinocytes (Figure 3D). Since butyrate treatment in KERTr cells at 1mM demonstrated a trend of stronger IL-33 suppression compared to the other two SCFAs, we further examined the dose-response of butyrate treatment on IL-33 expression. We found that butyrate suppressed IL-33 expression in S. aureus-infected KERTr cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3E), with the IL-33 suppression effect plateauing at 1 mM butyrate. We also assessed the toxicity effect of butyrate treatment on KERTr cells and observed no reduction in viability in butyrate-treated KERTr cell at the concentrations we examined, even at a high concentration of 100 mM (Figure 3F). Although all three SCFAs could inhibit IL-33 expression in S. aureus-infected keratinocytes, they did not suppress the growth of S. aureus (Figures 3G, H). This suggests that the inhibition of IL-33 in S. aureus-infected keratinocytes was not due to a reduction of S. aureus viability, but rather resulted from the regulatory effect of SCFAs on IL33 expression.\nButyrate suppresses IL-33 production and attenuates skin inflammation\nEncouraged by the results of our previous study on using butyrate as an immunomodulatory agent (18), we turned our\nFrontiers in Immunology 05\nfocus to assess the effects of butyrate on S. aureus-induced skin inflammation. We concurrently applied S. aureus and butyrate to the dorsal skin after AEW treatment, and the expression levels of Il33, Il13, and Il6mRNA were diminished by butyrate co-treatment (Figures 4A\u2013C). Simultaneously, we found that butyrate decreased the number of dermal infiltrating leukocytes in S. aureus-infected mice (Figure 4D; Supplemental Figure 1). However, the epidermal thickening was not influenced by butyrate treatment (Figure 4E). Collectively, these results demonstrated that butyrate could inhibit S. aureus-exacerbated skin inflammation by suppressing IL-33 release from keratinocytes.\nButyrate suppresses IL-33 expression in S. aureus-infected KERTr cell through HDAC3 inhibition\nPrevious studies have shown that SCFAs exert modulatory functions either by binding to free fatty acid receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3 to activate downstream signaling pathways (24, 25) or by inducing histone acetylation through HDAC inhibitory activity (26\u201328). To determine the involvement of FFAR2, FFAR3, and HDACs in response to butyrate in S. aureus infection, we first treated S. aureus-infected KERTr cells in the absence of butyrate with FFAR2 agonist 4-chloro-a-(1-methylethyl)-N-2-thiazolylbenzeneacetamide (4-CMTB), the FFAR3 agonist AR420626, or the pan-HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). We found that both receptor agonists and the pan-HDAC inhibitor suppressed S. aureus-induced IL-33 production (Figure 5A). Next, to clarify the mechanism underlying IL-33 release, KERTr cells were infected with S. aureus and treated with butyrate alone or co-treated with\nCtrl 6h 24h 6h 24h 0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nMOI=1 MOI=10\n****\n**** ***\n****\nCtrl 1 10 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nIl3 3\nm R\nN A\nfo ld\nch an\nge\nS.aureus (MOI)\nns\n*\nCtrl 1 10 0\n30\n60\n90\n120 ***\n(MOI) S. aureus\n**** ****\nCtrl SA 0\n100\n200\n300\n400 ****\nCtrl SA 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nn.d.\nCtrl SA 0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\nIL -2\n5 (n\ng/ m\nL)\nCtrl SA 0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nTS LP\n(n g/\nm L)\n****\nIL -2\n5 (p\ng/ m\nL)\nTS LP\n(p g/\nm L)\nIL -3\n3 (p\ng/ m\nL)\n****\nIL -3\n3 (n\ng/ m\nL)\nA B D\nE F G\nC\nFIGURE 1 S. aureus infection induces the expression of epithelial cell-derived IL-33 in vitro.

As expected, the results showed that both FFAR2 and FFAR3 agonists synergized with butyrate to inhibit IL-33 expression (Figure 5B). However, the effect of butyrate and TSA cotreatment on the level of IL-33 level did not differ significantly from either treatment on their own (Figure 5B).\nThe expression of HDAC3, a member of the class I HDAC family, is known to correlate with the expression of IL-33 (29). Therefore, we assessed the possible involvement of HDAC3 in IL-33 expression in S. aureus-infected keratinocytes. We found that the class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 alone suppressed S. aureus-induced IL-33 production in KERTr cells, and the co-treatment of butyrate and MS-275 did not further downregulate IL-33 expression in comparison to either treatment alone (Figure 5C), suggesting that butyrate might act as a HDAC inhibitor and lead to increased histone acetylation and regulated gene transcription. We went on to measure the level of histone 3 acetylation (AC-H3) using western blot and found that butyrate treatment caused an increase in histone 3 acetylation in KERTr cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 5D, E).\nWe next investigated whether butyrate acted on HDAC targets similarly to MS-275 in S. aureus-infected KERTr cells. Western blot analysis for class I HDACs HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8 revealed that only HDAC3 levels were reduced by butyrate treatment (Figures 5F, G; Supplemental Figures 2A\u2013C). To further determine the involvement of HDAC3 in IL-33 expression, we treated S. aureus-infected KERTr cells with HDAC3 antagonist RGFP966. We found that co-treatment\nFrontiers in Immunology 06\nwith butyrate and RGFP966 did not further suppress IL-33 expression compared to either treatment alone (Figure 5H). Collectively, our data suggest that butyrate can inhibit IL-33 expression in S. aureus-infected KERTr cells by blocking HDAC3 action."

Nevertheless, treatment with butyrate significantly reduced S. aureus-aggravated IL-33 expression in the skin (Figures 6A, B). To investigate the effect of butyrate on HDAC3 expression, we found that butyrate treatment significantly reduced S. aureus-exacerbated HDAC3 expression in the skin (Figures 6C, D). However, we did not observe a significant difference in the expression of other members of the HDAC class I, such as HDAC2, between the groups (Supplemental Figures 3A, B). We also observed a reduction in the co-localization of HDAC3 and IL-33 in butyrate-treated skin (Figure 6E). This suggests that butyrate inhibits keratinocyte-derived IL-33 expression in S. aureus-infected skin cells through HDAC3 inhibition.\nAE W\nAE W+\nSA 0\n10\n20\n30\n40 *\nAE W\nAE W+\nSA 0\n100\n200\n300\n400 ***\nAE W\nAE W+\nSA 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nn.d.\nIL -6\n(n g/\nm L)\nIL -3\n3 (p\ng/ m\nL)\nIl3 3\nm R\nN A\nfo ld\nc ha\nng e\nIl1 3\nm R\nN A\nfo ld\nc ha\nng e\nIl1 7a\nm R\nN A\nfo ld\nc ha\nng e\nIfn g\nm R\nN A\nfo ld\nc ha\nng e\nCtrl i.d.

Mechanistically, we found that butyrate could suppress keratinocyte-derived IL-33 expression in S. aureus-infected KERTr cells by inhibiting HDAC3. Overall, our findings, illustrated in Figure 7, suggest that butyrate may serve as a therapeutic agent for treating inflammatory skin conditions in AD patients with S. aureus infection.\nSkin commensal bacteria are known to produce the SCFA butyrate, which has been shown to prevent skin inflammatory response by activating skin resident regulatory T cells (30). SCFAs also inhibit Th2 responses and interact with other immune cells (31). In our prior study, we have demonstrated that butyrate, but not acetate or propionate, inhibits the Th2 response mediated by murine ILC2s in the lungs (18). Thus, based on our previous experience with SCFAs, we selected butyrate to investigate its effect on S. aureus-aggravated inflammation in the skin. Our results show that butyrate attenuates skin inflammatory responses, as evidenced by decreased infiltrating leukocytes and IL-33 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Although a previous study has reported that a high concentration of 50 mM butyrate is required to suppresses the growth of S. aureus (17),, we indirectly\nFrontiers in Immunology 08\nconfirmed this by demonstrating that no suppression of S. aureus growth was observed at the high dosage of 1 mM SCFAs (Figures 3G, H). Therefore, directly using butyrate to suppress S. aureus growth on the skin of AD patients may not be feasible. However, our data also showed that as little as 0.1 mM of butyrate was enough to inhibit S. aureus-aggravated IL-33 expression in vitro (Figures 3C, E), suggesting butyrate as a potential therapeutic agent for S. aureus-exacerbated skin inflammation.\nIn addition, our in vitro experiment also shows that acetate and propionate, likewise produced by the S. epidermidis glycerol fermentation (23), can inhibit IL-33 release from S. aureusinfected keratinocytes (Figures 3C, D). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that acetate and propionate can also suppress IL-33 expression to ameliorate skin inflammation. Further investigation is needed to determine whether acetate or propionate has a similar inhibitory effect as butyrate on S. aureusexacerbated skin inflammation in vivo. In short, our results suggest that microbial metabolites can positively influence S. aureusexacerbated skin inflammation.\nSCFAs produced by microbes have been reported to alter gene expression and cell proliferation by inhibiting the chromatinremodeling activity of HDACs (26).

Furthermore, butyrate-induced HDAC3 inhibition in the intestine leads to metabolic changes and the induction of the bactericidal function of macrophages, promoting gut homeostasis (33). In our investigation, we first established that butyrate could inhibit IL-33 expression in S. aureus-infected human keratinocyte KERTr cells through HDAC inhibition, especially of the class I HDAC. Subsequently, we demonstrated that butyrate upregulated histone 3 acetylation and downregulated HDAC3 expression. We also used\nFrontiers in Immunology 09\na HDAC3-specific inhibitor in S. aureus-infected KERTr cells to clarify the role of HDAC3 in IL-33 regulation and determine the inhibitory function of butyrate on HDAC3 activity. In the S. aureusinfected skin, we found that butyrate treatment significantly reduced the co-expression of IL-33 and HDAC3-expressing cells, further suggesting the regulation of butyrate in HADC3 and IL33 expression.\nOur data suggest that butyrate acts as an inhibitor of the class I HDACs in S. aureus-infected KERTr cells, and the downregulation of HDAC3 by butyrate attenuated IL-33 expression.

Although HDAC3 can act as a transcriptional repressor to influence IL-33 expression in many diseases, including multiple sclerosis and allergic asthma (29), it is still unclear whether the inhibitory effect of butyrate is due to the direct acetylation of the Il33 gene or indirectly through the transcriptional activation/suppression of other targets that can alter the IL-33 expression.
