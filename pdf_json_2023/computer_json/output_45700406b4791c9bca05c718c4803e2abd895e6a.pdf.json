Many of the fundamental results on these systems are collected in Filippov\u2019s seminal book (Filippov 1988). Some of his results have been partly rediscovered (see Hogan et al. 2016) for a case study from bifurcation theory). Other results are not well-known, or are themselves incomplete.\nA general planar piecewise smooth differential equation with switching manifold : y = 0 is given by\nx\u0307 = P+(x, y), y\u0307 = Q+(x, y), if y > 0, x\u0307 = P\u2212(x, y), y\u0307 = Q\u2212(x, y), if y < 0, (1)\nCommunicated by Alain Goriely.\nB S. John Hogan s.j.hogan@bristol.ac.uk\n1 Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK\n2 Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TW, UK\nwhere the functions P\u00b1 and Q\u00b1 can be smoothly extended to a neighbourhood of . We say that (1) is Ck\u2217 if P\u00b1, Q\u00b1 are Ck , k \u2208 Z+ \u222a {\u221e}, and C\u03c9\u2217 if they are analytic.1\nFilippov (1988, p. 220) describes a classification of singularities of (1) on . Assuming that the singularity is at the origin O := (0, 0), type 3 singularities occur if\nP\u00b1(0, 0) = 0, Q+(0, 0) = Q\u2212(0, 0) = 0. (2)\nOne type 3 singularity is the sewed focus,2 which ismade up of two invisible tangencies either side of the switching manifold (Filippov 1988, p. 234). Locally, trajectories in y > 0 are inverted parabolas and in y < 0 they are parabolas, creating a flow that can be focus-like (see Fig. 1) or centre-like. The conditions for a sewed focus are, up to a change in the direction of time,\nP+(0, 0) = b+ > 0, P\u2212(0, 0) = b\u2212 < 0, (3)\nand\nxQ\u00b1(x, 0) < 0 if x = 0 (4)\nfor x in some neighbourhood V of x = 0. The simplest sufficient condition to satisfy (4) locally is\nQ+x (0, 0) < 0, Q\u2212x (0, 0) < 0. (5)\nNote that (4) and (5) each imply that y\u0307 has the same sign at (x, 0) for all x = 0 on both sides of y = 0. Hence (1) admits unique solutions passing through . There is no sliding3 and hence no Filippov vector field.\nIf (1) is C\u03c9\u2217 , there are just two cases (Filippov 1988) up to time reversal: the singularity is either (i) a stable (unstable) focus, locally solutions tend to (0, 0) as t \u2192 \u221e (t \u2192 \u2212\u221e), and solutions reach (0, 0) in infinite time or (ii) a centre and all solutions except the singularity are periodic locally. Although these cases are given in Filippov (1988), one aim of this paper is to clarify the result and simplify the proof (see Theorem 1 below).\n1 Note that (Filippov 1988, p. 206) uses a more general definition: systems are said to be Ck\u2217 if P\u00b1 and Q\u00b1 are Ck and if is Ck+1, fixed and the same for all systems in the class. 2 Also called a fused, merged or stitched focus. 3 The vanishing of all derivatives with respect to x up to order k \u2212 1 and such that \u2202k Q\u00b1/\u2202xk < 0 also defines a sewed focus.\nAnother aim is to gain an understanding of the non-analytic cases, which were not fully considered in Filippov (1988). In the case of focus-like behaviour we show that if the system is Ck\u2217 , k \u2208 Z+ \u222a{\u221e}, then the approach to the singularity can be in finite time (see Theorem 3 below).\nWe also consider more general sewed centre-focus4 behaviour, which was not considered at all5 in Filippov (1988). In particular we show that there are uncountably many different local structures6 near this singularity (see Theorem 6 below).\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we review the theoretical framework and results attributed by Filippov (Filippov 1988, p. 234) to Bautin and Leontovich (1976) and Skriabin (1978), and give the description of the local structure for piecewise analytic systems, C\u03c9\u2217 (Theorem 1). This theorem has been outlined before Filippov (1988, \u00a719.4). It is included here because it does not appear to be well known. Our proof clarifies and simplifies the one given in (Filippov 1988, \u00a719.4).\nIn Sect. 3 we show that the approach to the singularity can be in finite time for piecewise non-analytic systems,Ck\u2217 , k \u2208 Z+ \u222a{\u221e}. In Sect. 4 we describe an example of a sewed focus with infinitely many isolated stable periodic orbits (Theorem 4) and show how this can be generalized to create systems with periodic orbits intersecting any bounded symmetric closed set (Theorem 6)."

            "text": "If (1) is C\u03c9\u2217 , there are two types of local behaviour, up to time reversal.\nTheorem 1 Suppose that the origin is a sewed focus of a C\u03c9\u2217 system (1). Then the origin is either (i) a centre or (ii) all solutions approach the singularity in infinite time as either t \u2192 \u221e (stable sewed focus) or t \u2192 \u2212\u221e (unstable sewed focus).\nProof The approach of Bautin and Leontovich (1976), as described by Filippov (Filippov 1988, p. 234), is to define functions \u03c3\u00b1 in a neighbourhood of the singularity.\nWith the time convention as in (3), in y \u2265 0, the function \u03c3+ takes (x1, 0) on , where x1 < 0, to the next intersection of the flowwith , given by (x2, 0), in forwards time, where x2 > 0. Hence in x < 0, \u03c3+(x1) = x2, locally; see Fig. 1. We can extend \u03c3+ to x \u2265 0 by defining \u03c3+(0) = 0 and \u03c3+(x2) = x1 with x2 > 0 iff \u03c3+(x1) = x2.\nThe function \u03c3\u2212 on following the flow in y \u2264 0, is defined in the same way: in x < 0, \u03c3\u2212(x1) = x0 > 0 and in x \u2265 0, \u03c3\u2212(0) = 0 and \u03c3\u2212(x0) = x1.\nHence\n\u03c3\u00b1(\u03c3\u00b1(x)) = x . (6)\n4 The centre-focus in smooth systems is well-defined (Perko 2001, p. 139). 5 \u201c[T]he cases of [sewed] centre-focus are not considered here\u201d (Filippov 1988, p. 222). 6 In fact, Filippov appears to have been aware of the complexity possible in this case, stating that \u201c...there are infinitely many [sewed] [centre-foci]\u201d (Filippov 1988, p. 250). But he offers no proof of this statement. The absence of any proof in the literature led us to results that follow.\nWe claim that \u03c3\u00b1 extend to analytic functions on a neighbourhood of x = 0 with\n\u03c3\u00b1(0) = 0, \u03c3\u00b1\u2032(0) = \u22121. (7)\nIt is straightforward to show that \u03c3\u00b1\u2032(0) = \u22121. Differentiate both sides of (6) with respect to x , to get \u03c3\u00b1\u2032(\u03c3\u00b1(x))\u03c3\u00b1\u2032(x) = 1. By assumption \u03c3\u00b1(0) = 0. Hence (\u03c3\u00b1\u2032(0))2 = 1, \u03c3\u00b1\u2032(0) = \u00b11. Since x\u03c3\u00b1(x) < 0, then \u03c3\u00b1\u2032(0) = \u22121.\nWe delay the justification of the claim to analyticity to the end of the proof. Let\n\u03c7(x) \u2261 \u03c3+(x) \u2212 \u03c3\u2212(x) (8)\nwhich is analytic on a neighbourhood of the origin. Using (7), we have\n\u03c7(0) = 0, \u03c7 \u2032(0) = 0. (9)\nWe begin by showing that if \u03c7(x) > 0 (< 0) \u2200x < 0 in a neighbourhood of the singularity, then \u03c7(x) > 0 (< 0) \u2200x > 0 (locally) as well.\nClearly \u03c3\u00b1\u2032(x) < 0 on a neighbourhood of the origin so \u03c3\u00b1 are decreasing functions7 of x locally. Suppose that \u03c7(x) > 0, that is \u03c3\u2212(x) < \u03c3+(x), for all x < 0 in a neighbourhood of x = 0. If we let \u03c3+(x) = x+, \u03c3\u2212(x) = x\u2212, then x+ > x\u2212 > 0. Since \u03c3+ is decreasing this implies that \u03c3+(x+) < \u03c3+(x\u2212). Subtract \u03c3\u2212(x\u2212) from both sides and hence\n0 = \u03c3+(x+) \u2212 \u03c3\u2212(x\u2212) < \u03c3+(x\u2212) \u2212 \u03c3\u2212(x\u2212)\nwhere the equality holds because \u03c3+(x+) = \u03c3\u2212(x\u2212) = \u03c3\u00b1(\u03c3\u00b1(x)) = x using (6). Hence if \u03c7(x) > 0 in x < 0 locally then \u03c7(x) > 0 in x > 0 locally. This follows from Fig. 2, since the functions z = \u03c3\u00b1(x) both decrease with x and are symmetric about the line z = x . If \u03c7(x) < 0 then the argument is completely analogous.\nSince \u03c7 , \u03c3+ and \u03c3\u2212 are analytic then either (i) \u03c7(x) \u2261 0 on a neighbourhood of x = 0, which implies that all local solutions are periodic and so the origin is a centre, or (ii) there exists r \u2265 2 such that \u03c7(k)(0) = 0, k = 1, . . . , r \u2212 1 and \u03c7(r)(0) = 0. In this case the previous argument implies that r is even, r = 2p say, and so locally\n\u03c7(x) = \u03c7 (2p)(0)\n(2p)! x 2p + o(x2p). (10)\nHence in a neighbourhood of x = 0 either \u03c7(x) < 0 for all x = 0 (a stable focus) or \u03c7(x) > 0 for all x = 0 (an unstable focus).\nThe proof that the approach of the origin takes place in infinite time for the sewed focus is given in (Filippov 1988, pp. 237\u2013238). Suppose that the first non-zero derivative of \u03c7 at the origin is at order 2p, as in (10). Let successive intersections of a trajectory with the x-axis be denoted by xn . By definition (8)\nx2n+2 = x2n + \u03c7(x2n+1), 7 Also true since orbits of a vector field on the plane can not intersect.\nFig. 2 Demonstration that if \u03c7(x) \u2261 \u03c3+(x) \u2212 \u03c3\u2212(x) > 0 \u2200x < 0 in a neighbourhood of the singularity, then \u03c7(x) > 0 \u2200x > 0 (locally) as well. Reproduction of (Filippov 1988,\nFigure 82, p. 235)\n\u03c3+(x)\n\u03c3\u2212(x)\n\u03c3+(x)\u03c3\u2212(x)\nz\nx\nz = x\nwhere x2n > 0, \u2200 n. Then (7) implies that x2n+1/x2n \u2192 \u22121 as n \u2192 \u221e. Hence by (10)\nx2n+2 \u2212 x2n = ax2p2n+1 + o(x2p2n+1)\nwhere a = \u03c7(2p)(0)/(2p)! = 0. Consider the stable8 sewed focus (a < 0). Then for sufficiently large n there exists A > 0 such that\nx2n+2 \u2265 x2n \u2212 Ax2p2n \u2265 x2n \u2212 Ax22n .\nWewill now show that \u2211\u221e\n1 x2n diverges. Since the speed in the x-direction is bounded away from zero in a neighbourhood of the origin, then the time taken to approach the origin will also then diverge.\nLet un+1 = un \u2212 Au2n . If u1 = x2 then \u2211\u221e 1 x2n \u2265 \u2211\u221e\n1 un . Let vn = x22n for n \u2265 2, chosen because \u2211\u221e 1 vn diverges.\nNow compare un with vn . Clearly u1 > v1. Now suppose that un > vn \u2200 n \u2208 [2,m]. Then\num+1 = um \u2212 Au2m > x2 2m \u2212 A x 2 2 4m2 .\nSo um+1 > vm+1 provided\nx2 2m \u2212 A x 2 2 4m2 > x2 2(m + 1)\nor, on rearranging\n2m2x2 > Ax 2 2m(m + 1).\n8 The unstable sewed focus a > 0 is similar after reversing the direction of time.\nThus if x2 is sufficiently small then um > vm . Hence both \u2211\u221e 1 x2n and \u2211\u221e\n1 un diverge, by the comparison test.\nIt remains only to demonstrate that \u03c3\u00b1 are analytic on a neighbourhood of x = 0. Filippov (1988) refers to classic analysis of Andronov et al. (1971), but here we sketch a rather simpler explanation due to Chillingworth (2016).\nConsider y \u2265 0 (the argument in y < 0 is similar). We have, from (1),\nx\u0307 = P+(x, y), y\u0307 = Q+(x, y)\nwith, from (3) and (4),\nP+(0, 0) = b+ > 0, xQ+(x, 0) < 0.\nBoth P+ and Q+ are analytic in a neighbourhood of (0, 0). Then write P+(x, y) = b++p+(x, y)with p+ analytic and p+(0, 0) = 0.Write Q+(x, y) = \u2212x2k+1r+(x)+ ys+(x, y) for some k \u2265 0, with r+(0) = 1\n(2k+1)! \u22022k+1Q+ \u2202x2k+1 (0, 0) = 0 (an odd power\nis needed to ensure that xQ+(x, 0) < 0 locally), with both r+ and s+ analytic near (0, 0).\nThen dy/dx = F+(x, y) where F+ is locally analytic and given by\nF+(x, y) = Q +(x, y)\nP+(x, y) = \u2212x2k+1R+(x) + yS+(x, y) (11)\nwith R+ and S+ analytic, close to r+ and s+ up to scaling. Thus solutions must lie9 on analytic curves of the form\ny = c \u2212 x2k+2W+(x)\nwhere c is constant, W+ is analytic, and W+(0) > 0. Consider a flow box in a neighbourhood of the origin bounded by two trajectories,\none with c > 0 and the other with c < 0. By an analytic change of coordinates\n9 Substitute into (11).\n(x, y) \u2192 (u, v) this can be transformed10 to a flow where solutions lie on horizontal lines as shown in Fig. 3. Then the line y = 0 maps to a curve\nv = C(1 + G(u))u2k+2.\nAn analytic near identity change of coordinates, leaving u unchanged, of the form (u, v) \u2192 (u, w), brings this to\nw = u2k+2.\nIn these new coordinates the return map is simply u \u2192 \u2212u which is analytic. Hence \u03c3+ is analytic, concluding the proof.\nProvided the smallest non-zero derivative of \u03c7 exists, the proof also works for Ck\nfunctions.\nTheorem 2 If the origin is a sewed focus of a Ck\u2217 system, k \u2265 2, and for some p such that 2p \u2264 k the function \u03c7 is C2p with\n\u03c7(s)(0) = 0, s = 1, 2, . . . , 2p \u2212 1, \u03c7(2p)(0) = 0,\nthen locally trajectories approach the origin in infinite time, as t \u2192 \u221e if\u03c7(2p)(0) < 0 and as t \u2192 \u2212\u221e if \u03c7(2p)(0) > 0."

The aim of this section is to show that finite time approach is also possible for these non-analytic systems.\nTheorem 3 For all k \u2208 Z+ \u222a {\u221e}, there exists a Ck\u2217 system of the sewed focus and a neighbourhood U of the origin such that if (x0, y0) \u2208 U then the trajectory through (x0, y0) tends to (0, 0) in finite time.\nProof First we assume k \u2208 Z+. Let H(x) denote the Heaviside function,\nH(x) = { 1 if x \u2265 0 0 if x < 0.\n(12)\nConsider system (1) with\nP+(x, y) = 1 Q+(x, y) = \u22124x3H(x) \u2212 8x7H(\u2212x), P\u2212(x, y) = \u22121, Q\u2212(x, y) = \u22124x3H(\u2212x) \u2212 8x7H(x). (13)\n10 One example of a simple transformation is (x, y) \u2192 (u, v) = (x, y + x2k+2W+(x)). In that case, y = 0 would map to v = W+(u)u2k+2 and so C(1 + G(u)) = W+(u).\nThe symmetry and the values of the constants (other than their signs) are not important, and have been chosen for algebraic convenience. This example is C2\u2217 and has a stable sewed focus at the origin. There is no sliding.\nGiven an initial point (\u2212x0, 0) with x0 > 0 sufficiently small, the solution will strike at points (x1, 0), (\u2212x2, 0), . . . with xi > 0. The total time T taken is given by\nT = x0 + 2 \u221e\u2211\nr=1 xr ,\nsince from (13) the speed in the x-direction is equal to 1. Thus if T < \u221e the singularity is contained in the approaching trajectory, and is\nreached in finite time. The trajectories of systems in the same topological class are mapped to each other. So the inclusion of the origin O in an approaching trajectory implies the existence of a new topological class, not possible in the analytic case.\nIf y > 0 then integral curves are given by\ny = c\u2212 \u2212 x8, x < 0, y = c+ \u2212 x4, x > 0 (14)\nwhere the constants c\u00b1 are determined by initial conditions. The integral curves in y < 0 are determined by symmetry.\nThus a solution starting at (\u2212x0, 0), x0 > 0, lies on the integral curve\ny = x80 \u2212 x8\nand strikes the y-axis after time x0 at y = x80 . It now continues on an integral curve of the form y = c+ \u2212 x4. Since y = x80 when x = 0, c+ = x80 . This integral curve in turn strikes at (x1, 0), x1 > 0, where x80 \u2212 x41 = 0, i.e. x1 = x20 , after a further x1 units of time.\nNow in y < 0, which by symmetry is effectively equivalent, the solution through (x1, 0) strikes at (\u2212x2, 0) where x2 = x21 = x40 after time x1 + x2. By induction, the infinite sequence of intersections is given by the points ((\u22121)(r+1)xr , 0) where\nxr = x2r0 and hence\nT = x0 + 2 \u221e\u2211\nr=1 x2\nr\n0 (15)\nThe sum (15) is certainly less than twice the sum of all powers of x0, which converges if x0 < 1 as it is a geometric progression, so this sum also converges to a finite value.\nReplacing 4x3 and 8x7 in (13) by 2kx2k\u22121 and 4kx4k\u22121, respectively, with k \u2265 3, the relation between subsequent intersections is unchanged and so this example can be made Cr\u2217 for any r < \u221e.\nWe now give an example11 of a C\u221e\u2217 system with finite time approach to the origin. Consider system (1) with\nP+(x, y) = 1, Q+(x, y) =\n\u23a7 \u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\u2212 2 x3 e\u22121/x2 , x < 0, 0, x = 0, \u2212 1\nx2 e\u22121/x , x < 0\nP\u2212(x, y) = \u22121, Q\u2212(x, y) =\n\u23a7 \u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23a9\n1 x2 e\u22121/x , x < 0 0, x = 0, \u2212 2\nx3 e\u22121/x2 , x > 0.\n(16)\nThen xr = x2r\u22121 for all r \u2265 1 and T , also given by Eq. (15), is finite. Hence there is a new topological class with finite time approach to the singularity for piecewise non-analytic systems, Ck\u2217 with k \u2208 Z+ \u222a {\u221e}."

Nothing else is possible.\nFor Ck\u2217 systems, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 \u221e we consider vector fields in y < 0 of the form\nP\u2212(x, y) = \u22121, Q\u2212(x, y) = \u22122x . (17) 11 We are extremely grateful to an anonymous reviewer for this example. 12 The issue of finite versus infinite time approach in case (a) is not included here as it was considered in Sect. 3.\nIn y < 0 solutions lie on parabolas of the form y = \u2212c2 + x2. In y > 0 define\nP+(x, y) = 1, Q+(x, y) = \u22122x + 2kx2k\u22121 f ( 1x ) \u2212 x2k\u22122 f \u2032( 1x ) (18)\nwith f (x) odd. By design, Q+ is Ck\u2217 for sufficiently differentiable f . So (1), with (17) and (18) is Ck\u2217 and satisfies (2).\nThe flow in y > 0 has been chosen so that solutions through (\u2212x0, 0) lie on curves\ny(x) = \u2212x2 + x2k f ( 1x ) + x20 + x2k0 f ( 1x0 ) (19)\nwhere we use the fact that f is odd. Hence\ny(x0) = 2x2k0 f ( 1x0 ).\nThe zeros of this function correspond precisely to the closed orbits of the vector field, provided that y(x) > 0 for all x \u2208 (\u2212x0, x0). Thus if we choose\nf (x) = sin 2\u03c0x\nand k \u2265 2, then \u2200 n \u2208 R, n \u2265 4, we have\nx0 = 1 n ,\nwhich lies on a (different) periodic solution for each n; those with n even are asymptotically stable and those with n odd are unstable.\nChoosing different forms of f gives different zero sets. Hence case (c) comes in infinitely many different types, depending on whether the components of sets with \u03c7(x) = 0 are intervals or points, and how these sets are connected.\nWe can nowmake some generalizations.We begin by recalling the following result.\nLemma 5 Let E be any symmetric compact subset of R not containing the origin (i.e. E = \u2212E and 0 /\u2208 E), and k \u2208 Z+ \u222a {\u221e}. Then there exists an odd Ck+1 function fE which, if k < \u221e, is not a Ck+2 function such that fE (x) = 0 if and only if x \u2208 E\u222a{0}. Proof Given a symmetric compact set E and 0 /\u2208 E , let E0 = E \u222a{0} and d(x, E0) = miny\u2208E0 |x \u2212 y|. Define\ngE (x) = \u2212sign(x)[d(x, E0)]k+2. (20)\nClearly gE is a continuous, odd function. Moreover, gE (x) = 0 iff x \u2208 E0. Since E0 is closed its complement is open and hence is a countable union of disjoint open intervals. The function gE is Ck+1 except at the mid-points of each of these intervals. But gE can be modified in a neighbourhood of each of these mid-points so that the modification fE is Ck+1 there and still odd. This proves the first part of the result if k < \u221e.\nIf k = \u221e it is still the case that the complement of E0 is open and is thus a union of disjoint open intervals. This union is countable (as each open interval contains a rational) and so we can label the intervals Ji = (ai \u2212 \u03b4i , ai + \u03b4i ), so that the centre points are ai and the length of Ji is 2\u03b4i , i = 1, 2, . . .. Now let\u03c8(x) denote the standard C\u221e bump function on the unit interval:\n\u03c8(x) = { exp ( \u2212 1 1\u2212x2 )\nif|x | < 1 0 if|x | \u2265 1,\n(21)\nand define\nfE (x) = \u221e\u2211\ni=1 \u2212sign(ai )\u03b4i\u03c8\n( x \u2212 ai\n\u03b4i\n)\n. (22)\nThen fE is C\u221e and zero if and only if x \u2208 E0 (0 \u2208 E0 by definition so ai = 0). Finally, fE is an odd function, since E0 is symmetric.\nThe separation of x = 0 from E in the statement of Lemma 5 is because the\ninterpretation of the points in E for the sewed focus (they are on periodic orbits) is different from the sewed focus itself which has x = 0.\nHence we have the rather remarkable theorem.\nTheorem 6 Let E be any symmetric compact subset of R not containing the origin. Then there exists a Ck\u2217 Filippov system (1), 1 \u2264 k \u2264 \u221e, with an isolated type 3 singularity, for which (x0, 0) lies on a periodic orbit if and only if x0 \u2208 E.\nProof: Choose 1 \u2264 k \u2264 \u221e and let fE (x) be the odd Ck+1 or C\u221e function of Lemma 5. Define the Ck\u2217 Filippov system using (17) in y < 0 and\nP+(x, y) = 1, Q+(x, y) = \u22122x + x2 f \u2032E (x) + 2x fE (x) (23)\nin y > 0, which satisfies (2) since f \u2032E is continuous. Furthermore, as f \u2032\u2032E is continuous and fE (0) = 0, Q\u00b1x (x, y) < 0 in a neighbourhood of the origin. Hence in this neighbourhood Q\u00b1(x, y) > 0 for x < 0 and Q\u00b1(x, y) < 0 for x > 0, which guarantees that there is no sliding in the neighbourhood of the origin. Thus solutions in y > 0 through (\u2212x0, 0) lie on sets\ny(x) = \u2212x2 + x2 fE (x) + x20 + x20 fE (x0) (24)\nby integrating dy/dx = Q+/P+, using (23). The flow in y < 0 implies that an orbit through (x0, 0), x0 > 0, next intersects the switching manifold at (\u2212x0, 0) and hence a periodic orbit through (\u00b1x0, 0) exists iff the flow in y > 0 takes (\u2212x0, 0) to (x0, 0), i.e. that \u03c3+(\u2212x0) = x0.\nFirst suppose that x0 > 0 and (x0, 0) lies on a periodic orbit. Then following the flow in y < 0, (\u2212x0, 0) lies on the same periodic orbit, and hence y(\u00b1x0) = 0. Then (24) gives\ny(x0) = 2x20 fE (x0) = 0,\nand so x0 \u2208 E . To prove sufficiency, suppose that x0 > 0 and x0 \u2208 E . Since E is symmetric \u2212x0 \u2208 E too, and so fE (\u00b1x0) = 0. Then, recalling that fE is odd, (24) gives\ny(x0) = 2x20 fE (x0) = 0,\nso an orbit through (\u2212x0, 0) crosses the switching manifold at (x0, 0). Suppose this is not the first crossing, i.e. that there exists at least one root y(x ) = 0 with x \u2208 (\u2212x0, x0). For all x \u2208 E0, |x | < x0,\ny(x) = \u2212x2 + x20 + x2 fE (x) = \u2212x2 + x20 > 0, (25)\nso x must be in the complement of E0, in one of the intervals Ji , see Lemma 5. Equation (25) also implies that y(x) > 0 at the endpoints of all these intervals; since y(x) is continuous, and has no tangencies (as Q\u00b1(x, y) = 0 for x = 0), there must be an even number of roots of y(x) in the interval Ji containing y . But this contradicts the fact that Q\u00b1(x, y) do not change sign on any interval Ji , as noted above. So there is no root x \u2208 (\u2212x0, x0), and the trajectory in y > 0 through (\u2212x0, 0) next crosses the switching manifold at (x0, 0), and hence is a periodic orbit for any x0 \u2208 E .\nFinally, let x0 > 0 with x0 /\u2208 E . Again, by symmetry of E , \u2212x0 /\u2208 E and this time (24) gives\ny(x0) = 2x20 fE (x0) = 0,\nso the trajectory through (\u2212x0, 0) cannot be a periodic orbit.\nIn Theorem 4, we have shown that there are uncountably many topological classes of the sewed centre-focus, a type of non-analytic isolated sewed focus singularity of a Ck\u2217 system (1), where 1 \u2264 k \u2264 \u221e. This result was generalized in Theorem 6."

            "text": "In this paper we have analyzed the sewed focus, a singularity of planar piecewise smooth systems. Although some analysis of this case is presented by Filippov (1988), we believe that many of our results are new. In the case of non-analytic focus-like behaviour we show that the approach to the singularity can be in finite time, forwards or backwards as appropriate. More generally, for the non-analytic sewed centre-focus, we show that there are uncountablymany different topological types of local dynamics, including cases with infinitely many stable periodic orbits.\nThe proof of our results uses a simple construction. By considering particular cases in greater detail it is then possible to define Ck\u2217 systems, k \u2208 Z+ \u222a {\u221e}, which have infinitely many stable periodic orbits. This is another case of \u2018infinitely many sinks\u2019 arising in piecewise smooth systems, although the mechanism is totally different from the examples for the border collision normal form Simpson (2014). See also recent work (Huzak and Kristiansen 2022), which shows that the number of limit cycles for regularized piecewise polynomial systems is unbounded.\nHence Hilbert\u2019s 16th Problem, concerning the number of stable periodic orbits of planar differential equations, is not relevant for the Ck\u2217 sewed focus. This problem has attracted considerable recent attention in the case of piecewise linear systems with a linear switching manifold (Euz\u00e9bio and Llibre 2015; Llibre and Zhang 2018). In contrast, our paper answers the question for more general piecewise smooth systems.\nThe sewed focus is one of the earliest examples of type 3 singularities to be considered in the applied literature, with examples from the 1930s being included in Andronov et al. (1966, p. 511). These examples are C\u03c9\u2217 , so our more interesting results described here do not apply. But the effects described may arise in examples with more complicated switches which change higher derivatives of the flow in either y > 0 or y < 0 or both, as shown in Sect. 3.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to David Chillingworth (University of Southampton) for his insights on the analyticity of return maps, and to JamesMontaldi and Jonathan Fraser (University ofManchester) for helpful discussions, especially concerning Lemma 5.
