Such high electric RF fields are usually reached with the help of a resonator in close proximity to the ion trap. Ion trap based quantum computers profit from good vacuum conditions and low heating rates that cryogenic environments provide. However, an impedance matching network between the resonator and its RF source is necessary, as an unmatched resonator would require higher input power due to power reflection. The reflected power would not contribute to the RF trapping potential, and the losses in the cable induce additional heat into the system. The electrical properties of the matching network components change during cooling, and a cryogenic setup usually prohibits physical access to integrated components while the experiment is running. This circumstance leads to either several cooling cycles to improve the matching at cryogenic temperatures or the operation of poorly matched resonators. In this work, we demonstrate an RF resonator that is actively matched to the wave impedance of coaxial cables and the signal source. The active part of the matching circuit consists of a varactor diode array. Its capacitance depends on the DC voltage applied from outside the cryostat. We present measurements of the power reflection, the Q-factor, and higher harmonic signals resulting from the nonlinearity of the varactor diodes. The RF resonator is tested in a cryostat at room temperature and cryogenic temperatures, down to 4.3 K. A superior impedance matching for different ion traps can be achieved with this type of resonator. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\nAtomic ions trapped in a radio frequency (RF) Paul trap are a well-controlled quantum system that has been used in quantum logic applications such as quantum computing,1,2 quantum simulation,3 and frequency metrology.4 While important milestones for quantum logic operations such as ground state cooling of the quantized motional degrees of freedom have been reached in room temperature (RT) setups,5,6 systems with many ions and especially surface electrode traps7,8 profit immensely from cooling below 30 K9 and the resulting lower vacuum pressure and lower ion heating rates.\nA Paul trap uses a combination of RF and direct current (DC) fields to generate a trapping potential. For surface-electrode traps, the required voltage is usually of the order of 100 V. Because of Joule\nheating and RF crosstalk, this high voltage should not be applied to the long RF cables that run from room temperature to the cold stage of the cryostat.10 Instead, a step-up resonator close to the trap is used.\nThe context of the present work is the development of microwave near-field based quantum operations11,12 carried out on 9Be+ ions in surface-electrode ion traps13\u201315 in a cryogenic environment.16 Most ion trap setups use helical resonators,17\u201319 whose key properties are given by their geometry. Cooling them down to cryogenic temperatures not only lets them shrink, but also changes their electrical characteristics, mainly their resistance. This leads to changes in the RF incoupling and quality factor that are sometimes hard to predict, thereby making them unfriendly to use. Lumpedelement resonators do not suffer from geometry changes as much as helical resonators do and have been used in some experiments.10\nRev. Sci. Instrum. 93, 093201 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0097583 93, 093201-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 20:26:30\nHowever, both types of resonators lack the ability to in situ tune the incoupling to achieve the best possible impedance matching between the source and the trap.\nThe dimensioning of a matching circuit was described by Gandolfi et al.10 and Brandl et al.20 In particular, for scenarios where traps will be designed, fabricated, and tested in an iterative process, their impedance may differ in each case. The necessary adjustments of system components therefore need to be minimized. Remodeling the resonator when switching between similar trap designs should be avoided for a fast commissioning. Therefore, a matching network that can be controlled electrically from the outside of the vacuum chamber to match a wider band of impedances would be a desirable solution. Varactor diodes have already been used for compensation of phase shifts in a different trap design, where several RF voltages are necessary.21,22 In this paper, we use varactor diodes for a voltage-controlled impedance matching network."

            "text": "The development of the resonator and the matching network is based on the circuit model depicted in Fig. 1. It shows the source of the RF signal, which operates at room temperature outside the cryostat. Using coaxial cables, the signal is passed to the resonator box with the matching network and a coil located on a printed circuit board (PCB) next to the ion trap.\nThe coil L and the capacitance of the ion trap Ctrap form a series resonant circuit. The coil is made from a silver wire with a diameter of 1.2 mm wound on a bobbin made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK). The bobbin is threaded to prevent the wire from slipping. The coil has a length of 18 mm, a diameter of 9.8 mm, and 6 windings. The ion trap has a capacitance of Ctrap \u2248 10 pF.\nThe impedance Z resonator for a series resonator is the sum of the coil impedance j\u03c9Lcoil, the impedance of the trap capacitance ( j\u03c9Ctrap)\u22121, and the resistance of the resonator, which is dominated by the wire of the coil Rcoil,\nZ resonator = Rcoil + j\u03c9L + 1\nj\u03c9Ctrap . (1)\nSupplying the circuit with the resonance frequency reduces Z resonator to Rcoil with\nZ resonator = RCoil \u226a Z0 = 50 \u03a9. (2)\nA simplified method of matching a resonator to the source impedance with an L-network by using only one reactance is explained in Gandolfi et al.10 in detail. A parallel resonant circuit requires the matching reactance\u2014either a capacitor or an inductor\u2014to be placed in series with the resonant circuit. As part of the matching reactance, the varactor diodes would be exposed to high voltages. In contrast, the matching reactance of a series resonant circuit must be designed in parallel with the resonant circuit, which decreases the voltage at the diodes significantly. Therefore, a series resonant circuit was chosen for the resonator designed in this work.\nThe resulting matching circuit consists of a parallel capacitance Coffset and an active matching network. Both are depicted in Fig. 2. Coffset consists of a fixed ceramic capacitor and a ceramic chip trimmer capacitor (Knowles JZ400HV 8\u201340 pF) for fast adjustments. The active matching network consists of varactor diodes (MACOM MA46H204), whose voltage dependent capacitance can be used to control the overall capacitance of the matching network.\nThe capacitance of the varactor diodes D1. . .8 can be controlled by applying the voltage Vbias from outside the cryostat. The dynamic range of the capacitance of the complete matching network is (3.7\u201323.4 pF) + Coffset at room temperature. The capacitors C1 and C2 decouple the control DC voltage (Vbias) from the RF signal, while L1,2,3 prevent a short circuit of the RF signal via connections to the DC voltage source.\nThe \u201cback to back\u201d connection of the varactors divides the adjustable range of the network in halves, but ensures that the characteristic curve of the varactor capacitance, which is approximately proportional to (Vbias)\u22121, is slightly linearized around the operating point. This is important, as the voltage of the RF signal also changes the capacitance periodically. Despite the linearization, the matching network is expected to generate mixing products in the form of higher harmonics of the excitation frequency.\nThe matching network and the resonator coil are located on a PCB in a shielding box made of copper sheet with a thickness of 0.5 mm. This reduces the coupling between the RF signal and other electronic components. The connection between the coil and the ion trap is made with an unshielded cable. Any shielding would add a parasitic capacitance that affects the resonance frequency and the matching.16\nRev. Sci.

The full test setup is shown in Fig. 3.\nAn isolation vacuum is established around the two cooling stages of the cryocooler to prevent icing and to reduce the thermal load. A radiation shield inside the vacuum chamber shields\nthe second cooling stage from black body radiation of the vacuum chamber, which is at room temperature (RT). The radiation shield is connected to the first cooling stage, where a higher thermal load can be tolerated compared to the second stage. The isolation vacuum is established through a vacuum pump (Agilent X3580A). The pressure is measured next to the pump (Agilent FRG-700). Another vacuum gauge is installed at the top of the vacuum chamber to provide a complementary pressure measurement. A Lakeshore Model 335 is used for temperature control via DT-670B-CU sensors at the first and second stage of the cryostat. Temperatures of 4.3 K and pressures in the range 10\u22127 to 10\u22129 mbar were reached for all low temperature data that are presented in this paper.\nInside the vacuum chamber, two cables (GVL Cryoengineering GVLZ175) connect to the varactor diodes via D-Sub pins. The varactor diode voltage Vbias is provided by two grounded BNC connector feedthroughs. These are connected on the air-side with two RG-58 cables, which are split into conductor and ground lines and\nRev. Sci.

A digital power supply (Rigol DP832) provides the Vbias.\nRF signals are routed into the vacuum chamber via two floating SMA feedthroughs. For simplicity of the test setup, the coaxial cables inside the vacuum chamber are not thermalized on the first cooling stage, but are connected directly to the devices at the second cooling stage with Allectra 311-KAP50S coaxial cables. Two cables of this type, with lengths of 550 and 620 mm, connect to the RF input socket of the resonator and to an ion trap electrode, which in the aforementioned scenario of quantum logic operations induced by microwave near-fields would be used to carry microwave currents and is therefore connected to the outside via RF-compatible cables. This electrode is further referenced as the microwave meander (MWM).23 The RF output of the resonator box and the RF input of the ion trap PCB are connected with a 120 mm long, shielding-stripped 311-KAP50S.\nOn the air-side, a signal generator (Siglent SDG2122X) and a vector network analyzer (VNA) Rohde & Schwarz ZVL3 are connected to the cryostat via RG-58 cables. The calibration of the VNA removes the influence of the air-side cables.\nA rendering of the test setup and a picture of the RF resonator box is shown in Fig. 4. The test setup is attached to the second stage of the cryocooler. A copper structure was mounted to the second stage to provide thermalization and attachment points. The ion trap on its corresponding PCB, a temperature sensor, and the resonator box are attached to this copper structure. The ground potential of the RF resonator box is connected to the general ground of the setup via the copper structure. The PCB of the ion trap is connected to the same copper structure and thus to the same ground potential. Both, PCB and ion trap, are duplicates of a running quantum logic experiment.16"

Power reflection coefficient S11 as a function of frequency for five different Vbias measured at room temperature (RT) and at 4.3 K. Optimal S11 for Vbias different from the 5 V increments is displayed in dashed lines. In (a), data of an RT-optimized matching with Coffset = 140 pF are shown. In (b), data of a setup with Coffset = 271.5 pF at RT are presented, which are optimized for a matching at 4.3 K, as shown in (c).\nDuring cooldowns of the test setup commissioning phase, we observed only small changes in the resonant frequency (\u22483%), but significant changes in the incoupling. It could be deduced that the dominant effect for this change in network matching is an increase in conductivity. The matching capacitance has to be set to a value that is too big for a matching at room temperature to compensate the impedance shift caused by the falling temperatures when cooling the experiment to cryogenic temperatures\u2014we call this state overcoupled.\nFor the cryogenic matching, the fixed capacitance is 240 pF. The trimmer capacitor was set to a value of \u223c31.5 pF, which results in Coffset = 271.5 pF. Figure 6(b) shows S11 at RT, and Fig. 6(c) shows the same system at 4.3 K. The optimal matching in Fig. 6(c) was achieved with a bias voltage of Vbias = 3 V. For this Vbias, the Q-factor was calculated to 212 for the cryogenic data shown in Fig. 6(c).\nOn comparison of Figs. 6(a) and 6(c), it is noticed that the range between the minimal and maximal reflection parameters is smaller in the cryogenic measurement. The first reason for the smaller range is the decreasing capacitance of the GaAs varactors when cooling to cryogenic temperatures.24 The second reason is that the value of Coffset was increased by a factor of 1.9.

The power was measured indirectly based on cross-coupling to the adjacent MWM electrode of the ion trap to avoid influence due to electrical properties with a measurement setup. These electrodes are used as the pickup device for RF signals produced by the RF electrodes nearby.\nFirst, the coupling between the RF electrodes and the MWM was determined. For this, the resonator box was disconnected from the trap, and the RF and MWM connections of the trap were connected to the VNA. This setup is shown in Fig. 5(b). After cooling down, the reflection and transmission parameters of the system S11-RF-MWM and S21-RF-MWM were measured. The S21-RF-MWM parameter represents the transfer function under the assumption of a two-port network from the RF input to the MWM. We calculated the frequency dependent loss transfer function H( f ) from RF to MWM, based on Eqs. (3) and (4), which show the definitions of the S11-RF-MWM and S21-RF-MWM parameters,\nS11\u2212RF\u2212MWM = 10 \u22c5 log10( Preflected Pinput ), (3)\nS21\u2212RF\u2212MWM = 10 \u22c5 log10( Ptransmitted\nPinput ).

(6)\nThe measured S-parameters S11-RF-MWM and S21-RF-MWM and the calculated loss transfer function H( f ) are shown in Fig. 7.\nThe resonator box was reconnected to the ion trap after the determination of H( f ), and the system was cooled again. RF voltages of 5 Vpp at resonance frequency were applied to the RF resonator by the signal generator. This setup is shown in Fig. 5(c). The reassembly shifted the resonance frequency of the system to f0 = 116.27 MHz. The signal at the microwave port was analyzed for multiples n of the excitation frequency using the spectrum analyzer available in the VNA. To check the dependency of the spectrum on the bias voltage, the measurement was repeated for Vbias = 0, 10, and 20 V. The resulting values for different voltages Vbias were then corrected with the parameter H( f ) and are shown in Fig. 8.\nThe ion trap used in this setup was designed for 9Be+.14 At 22.3 mT, 9Be+ exhibits a first-order magnetic field-independent qubit transition. We have calculated the frequency range of the ground state hyperfine transitions, which can be used for quantum logic operations, to be between 854 and 1764 MHz. This corresponds to a range of the seventh to the 16th harmonic of the fundamental of the RF signal. Accidental excitation of those transitions would disturb the logic operations. Figure 8 shows that the power levels drop\nbelow \u221270 dBm in the relevant frequency ranges. The power level of the second harmonic is already 60 dB suppressed compared to the fundamental. The power of frequencies n > 13 dropped below the noise floor.\nWithout testing, the influence of the measured signals on the qubit remains unknown. However, as the typical hyperfine qubit transitions are magnetic dipole transitions, any influence on the qubit would be due to AC magnetic fields resulting from AC currents due to the periodic recharging of parasitic capacitance in the trap by the trap drive. Unless a harmonic of the trap drive hits the qubit frequency directly, stronger effects would typically arise from the fundamental if it is too close to one of the Zeeman transitions, which can be of the order of 100 MHz for typical long-lived intermediatefield qubit states.25 Such effects can be avoided through a reasonable choice of the drive frequency."

The adjustability allows us to operate different traps without applying changes to the matching circuit. If the dynamic range of the capacitance is not sufficient to match a larger quantity of impedances, the range can be increased by adding more varactors. The power in the frequency range relevant for ion manipulation is strongly suppressed such that the use of the active matching network is not expected to influence the ions.
