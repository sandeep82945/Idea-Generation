    "abstractText": "Indole diterpenoids (IDTs) are an essential class of structurally diverse fungal secondary metabolites, that generally appear to be restricted to a limited number of fungi, such as Penicillium, Aspergillus, Claviceps, and Epichloe species, etc. These compounds share a typical core structure consisting of a cyclic diterpene skeleton of geranylgeranyl diphos\u2010 phate (GGPP) and an indole ring moiety derived from indole\u20103\u2010glycerol phosphate (IGP). 3\u2010geranylgeranylindole (3\u2010GGI) is the common precursor of all IDTs. On this basis, it is modified by cyclization, oxidation, and prenylation to generate a large class of compounds with complex structures. These compounds exhibit antibacterial, anti\u2010insect, and ion channel inhibitory activities. We summarized 204 compounds of IDTs discovered from various fungi over the past 50 years, these compounds were reclassified, and their biological activities were summarized. This review will help to understand the structural diversity of IDTs and provide help for their physiological activities.",

            "text": "IDTs are a structurally diverse class of fungal secondary metabolites, all sharing a common core structure consisting of indole, and a diterpene carbon backbone derived from four mevalonate-derived isoprene units [1]. The molecular complexity of these compounds is achieved by adding more isoprene units to the core structure and by various modifications such as oxidation, cyclization, and halogenation. IDTs are ubiquitous in the natural environment, and moldy food produced by Penicillium sp. is a common source of these compounds. For example, the fungus P. tularense found in tomatoes has metabolites such as janthitrems, paspalinine, paxilline, etc. [2]. P. crustosum, which produces the shivering mycotoxin penitrems, is a common foodborne fungus that can cause the spoilage of many foods [3].\nMost of the IDTs are potent tremor mammalian mycotoxins [4], that also exhibit excellent biological activities, including cytotoxic, antibacterial, antiviral, and protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitory activities [5]. To date, some IDT compounds have been used for drug discovery. For example, as BK channel blockers, IDTs have been shown to reduce intraocular pressure and have been used to treat glaucoma [6]. The H1N1 virus is an invasive strain of influenza virus that can cause death in humans, and many IDTs have also shown significant activity against the H1N1 virus, especially emndole SB [7]. In agricultural settings, there has been a general trend toward using tremor-free IDTs as pesticides, such as 20,25-dihydroxyaflavinine [8].\nAccording to previous reports, 3-GGI is a common precursor compound of all IDTs. The origin of the indole ring in its structure was clarified in 1983, when Jesus et\u00a0al. studied the biosynthesis of penitrem A, the results of isotope labeling experiments showed that the indole part was derived from the\u00a0 IGP precursor of tryptophan[9]. In 2013, Tagami et\u00a0al. analyzed a pentenyltransfer PaxC in paxilline biosynthetic gene cluster, and proved that indole ring derived from IGP through in\u00a0 vitro enzyme activity experiment [10]. Next, on this basis, IDT can be further divided into two types, namely the paspaline type with a large proportion and a small part of the non-paspaline type. There are some reviews related to IDTs have been presented. For example, the synthesis and activity of paspaline-type compounds [11, 12], the structural diversity and biological activity [5], biosynthesis of IDTs are described [13\u201315]. However, considering that these reviews do not classify these two types of compounds uniformly, and exclude the cover of the latest IDT compounds in recent years. So here, we renamed the IDT skeleton rings A, B, C, D, E, and F, and 77 non-paspaline skeleton and 127 paspaline skeleton IDTs were uniformly\nreclassified and summarized according to their structures and oxidative modifications. This review will contribute to the scientific community\u2019s comprehensive and compact understanding of the complex and diverse IDTs."

            "text": "A significant feature of this series is a caproic acid attached to the E ring, which contains 31 kinds of IDT compounds (Fig.\u00a0 1 and Table\u00a0 1). Nodulisporic acid A (NsA A, 1) was discovered in Hypoxylon pulicicidum in 1992, and was first reported as a potent insecticide in 1997 [16]. It exhibits optimal activity with an LD90 (lethal dose 90%) of 1.5\u00a0\u03bcM in the flea assay and an IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 0.00027\u00a0 \u03bcM in the binding assay [17]. In 1999, Otto D et\u00a0 al. found the compounds nodulisporic acid A1 (NsA A1, 2) and nodulisporic acid A2 (NsA A2, 3) from Nodulisporium spp., the LD50 (lethal dose 50%) of 2 to green flies was 0.3\u20131\u00a0 \u03bcg/mL, like compound 1. In the mosquito larvae assay, compound 2 was the strongest with an LD90 of 200\u00a0ng/mL [18], while 3 was slightly less active, with an LD50 of 0.6\u20131.5\u00a0 \u03bcg/mL [19]. From Nodulisporium spp., nodulisporic acid B (NsA B, 4), nodulisporic acid B1 (NsA B1, 5), nodulisporic acid B2 (NsA B2, 6), dehydroNsA B (7), dehydro-NsA C (8) and derivative-compound 9\u201312 were found in 2002, in which 4 was 100 fold less active on fleas than 1. 5 is slightly more active than 6. It was also found that while the methyl ester derivative of 11 was tenfold less active than the corresponding acid 1, the activity of 5 and its methyl ester 10 was similar. 10 might be slightly more potent than 4. However, compounds 5, 6, and 12 were inactive at 100\u00a0ppm (parts per million) [20]. In 2003, nodulisporic acid C (NsA C, 13), nodulisporic acid C1 (NsA C1, 14), nodulisporic acid C2 (NsA C2, 15) were found. 13 showed good activity against fleas, which was 10 times lower than 1, and the LD90 was 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; but compounds 14 and 15 had no activity in the flea test. The activity of compound 13 was significantly lower in mosquito larvae and fly maggot larvae assays (LD90 = 10,000\u00a0 ng/mL) [21]. In 2004, nodulisporic acid D (NsA D, 16), D1 (NsA D1, 17), D2 (NsA D2, 18), D3 (NsA D3, 19), E (NsA E, 20), F (NsA F, 21), A4 (NsA A4, 22) and compound 23\u201329 were successively discovered in the mutant strain Nodulisporium spp. In the flea assay test, compounds 16, 20, and 21 were 62, 12, and 30 fold less active than 1, respectively. Nodulisporic acid containing a dienoic acid chain showed better activity in its series. For example, 1 is more active than 2 and 3. However, in the NsA D series, the biological activity of 18 is significantly better than that of 16 and 17. No biological activity was detected for compounds 23\u201329, and\u039423 or 24-nodulisporic acids (27,\n28, 29) were less active than corresponding nodulisporic acids of the same class [18]. In 2022, Zhang YH et\u00a0al. isolated two specific compounds, oxalerpene A and B (30 and 31), from Penicillium oxalicum. 30 is the first IDT derivative with a 4-hydroxy-5,5-dimethylhydrofuran3-one in the five-membered side chain. 31 has a unique 6/5/6/6/6/6/6/5/5/5 ring system. Oxalerpene A and B have antiviral activity against H1N1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with IC50 values from 2.8 to 9.4\u00a0 \u00b5M [22]."

In 2010, asporyzin C (33) was isolated from Aspergillus oryzae, and the antibacterial activity against E. coli as well as the antifungal\nactivity against plant pathogens Colletotrichum lagenarium and Fusarium oxysporium were assayed. 33 exhibited intense activity against E. coli with an inhibitory diameter of 8.3\u00a0mm [25]. In 2020, the natural product penerpene J (34) was found in the fungus Penicillium sp. KFD28. This compound has inhibitory activity against both PTP1B (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B) and TCPTP (protein tyrosine phosphatase), with IC50 values of 9.5\u00a0 \u03bcM and 14.7\u00a0 \u03bcM, respectively [26].

In 1989, nominine (40) was isolated as the leading organic soluble component of the sclerotium of the fungus Aspergillus nomius NRRL 13,137, which showed potent activity against the widespread crop pest Heliothis zea. When added to the standard test diet at 100\u00a0ppm dry weight, it resulted in 40% mortality and 97% weight loss relative to controls [30]. In 1992, compounds\nradarin A\u2013D (41\u201344) were isolated from the fungus Aspergillus sulphureus. When added to a standard test diet of the corn worm Helicoverpa zea at 100\u00a0 ppm, 41 reduced body weight gain by 52.7% relative to the control after 1\u00a0 week. 43 also showed some activity at the same concentration, resulting in a 17.1% reduction in body weight gain. While 42 and 44 were inactive. Further biological evaluations were then performed to show that 41 was active against human lung cancer A549, breast cancer MCF7, and colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells with ED50 values of 2.5, 5.5, and 1.9\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. 42 was active in all three cell lines with ED50 (median effective dose) values of 2.0, 2.0,and 0.7\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL, respectively [31]. In 1992, emeniveol (45) was isolated from Emericella nivea, and when the concentration was 100\u00a0 mg/L, it could inhibit the germination of pine pollen and the growth of camellia pollen by about 35.5% [32]. In 2006, three IDTs were isolated from the mycelium of Emericella purpurea, namely emindoles PA (46), PB (47), and PC (48), among which 47 has strong anti-cancer activity [33]. Later, it found that its precursor compound preemindole PA (49) [13]. Liu L et\u00a0al. isolated the compound penicindopene A (50) from Penicillium sp.

In the same year, the compound sulpinine C (63) was isolated from Aspergillus sulphureus, which was weakly active against H. zea but inactive against C. hemipterus [44]. In 1992, Gloer JB and his colleagues reported the anti-insect metabolite aspernomine (64) from Aspergillus nomius, which showed moderate activity against H. zea. Incorporating this compound at 100\u00a0 ppm into the standard test diet resulted in a 35% reduction in body weight gain of the test insects relative to the control. Moreover, it also exhibited cytotoxicity against three human tumor cell lines, with ED50 values of 3.09, 4.93, and 3.08\u00a0 \u03bcg/ mL against A-549 lung, MCF-7 breast,and HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, respectively [45].

Among them, the IC50 value of 179 on L5178Y or A2780 cells is 10\u00a0\u03bcM [42]. In 2019, during chemical research on the endophyte Penicillium sp. ZO-R1-1 isolated from the medicinal plant ginger root, the compounds 7-methoxypyrapaxilline (180) and pyrapaxilline-6-ene (181) were discovered. Among them, the compound 181 showed cytotoxicity with IC50 values in the range of 5.3\u20138.1\u00a0\u03bcM; and also showed significant cytotoxic activity against the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line, with IC50 values of 5.3\u20138.7\u00a0\u03bcM [42]."

In 1981, two strong neurotoxins, lolitrems A (182) and B (183), were isolated from herbs that developed a livestock disease known as \"ryegrass staggered disease.\" They can poison livestock with tremors that do not directly impair spatial learning and memory, but reduce voluntary movements in poisoned animals; later, perennial ryegrass toxicosis (PRGT) was prevented by limiting the concentration of 183 [95]. In 1992, lolitriol (184) was found in extracts of endophyte-infected ryegrass leaves and cultures of A. lolii [43]. Moreover,\n183 is quickly degraded to compound 184, which does not cause tremors even at 20\u00a0mg/kg, so its activity is at least 20-fold lower than 183 [96]. In 1994, Christopher et\u00a0 al. obtained the abundant secondary compound lolitrem E (185) when 183 was purified from ryegrass staggers (RGS), which has intense BK channel activity but no tremor effect in animals [97, 98]. In 1996, Sarah et\u00a0al. isolated lolitrem F (186), a stereoisomer of the vibratory mycotoxin 183, from ryegrass infected with Acremonium Lolii. The compound 186 was found to have similar potency and duration of action as 183 in standard mouse bioassays, but was slightly less active than 183 [99]. In 1997, the compound lolitrem H (187) was discovered [71]. In 1997, Sarah et\u00a0al. isolated lolilline (188) from an extract of ryegrass seeds infected with the endophytic fungus Acremonium lolii, which does not have tremor effects [100]. In 1998, lolitrem N (189), lolicine A (190), and B (191) were identified in an extract of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) seeds infected with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium lolii, and they are lolitremlike compounds [101]."

In 1983, Amelia et\u00a0 al. isolated 6 IDTs penitrems A\u2013F (192\u2013 197) from Penicillium crustosum, wherein the compounds 192, 194, and 197 showed the anti-cancer effect on human A-549 and HL-60 cancer cell lines\n[49, 102]. It was also found that all chlorinated compounds (192, 194, and 197) exhibited more vigorous activity than their chlorine-free analogs, 193, 195, and 196 [24, 49]. In 1992, the compound secopenitrem B (198) was isolated from Aspergillus sulphureus, which was active against H. zea but inactive against C. hemipterus. It reduced weight gain by 87.0%, while 198 also caused 32.0% larval mortality [44]. In 1993, Yamaguchi et\u00a0 al. isolated PC-M4 (199) from P. crustosum, which could be biosynthesized by PC-M6, and then added isoprenyl to give PC-M5, which had no cancer cell activity [59]. In 2011, the compound secopenitrem D (200) was isolated and characterized from P. crustosum, which caused poisoning in animals [103]. In 2016, Gao et\u00a0al. discovered the compounds rhizovarins A\u2013C (201\u2013203) and E (204) from Rhizomucor Mucor irregularis QEN-189, which represent the most complex members of the IDT derivatives. Among them, 201 and 202 showed activity against human A-549 and HL-60 cancer cell lines, and compound 204 showed activity against the A-549 cancer cell line, but not the Hela cell line [49]."

Based on previous classifications, we divided 77 nonpaspaline compounds into 6 categories according to their structural characteristics, and 127 paspaline-type compounds are divided into 7 categories according to\noxidative modification. This provides convenient data for the future discovery of new compounds with similar structures or different oxidative modifications. At the same time, we also summarize the biophysiological activities of these compounds and their strong applications in pharmaceutical and agricultural markets. This also shows more compounds and provides more potent options for the development summary of future market applications.\nAcknowledgements This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 22077102 and 21877089), and the Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Natural Product & Chemical Biology Open Foundation (Project No. SXNPCB 2021001).\nAuthor contributions All authors read and approved the final manuscript.\nDeclarations\nCompeting interests The author declares that there are no conflicts of interest associated with this work.\nAuthor details 1 Key Laboratory for Enzyme and Enzyme\u2011Like Material Engineering of Heilongjiang, College of Life Science, Northeast Forestry University, Har\u2011 bin 150040, Heilongjiang, China. 2 Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Natural Products and Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China.\nReceived: 14 October 2022 Accepted: 8 December 2022 Published: 3 January 2023\nReferences 1.
