    "abstractText": "The microbiologically influenced corrosion of 201 stainless steel by Shewanella algae was investigated via modulating the concentration of fumarate (electron acceptor) in the medium and constructing mutant strains induced by \u2206OmcA. The ICP-MS and electrochemical tests showed that the presence of S. algae enhanced the degradation of the passive film; the lack of an electron acceptor further aggravated the effect and mainly affected the early stage of MIC. The electrochemical tests and atomic force microscopy characterization revealed that the ability of \u2206OmcA to transfer electrons to the passive film was significantly reduced in the absence of the c-type cytochrome OmcA related to EET progress, leading to the lower corrosion rate of the steel.",

            "text": "Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) refers to the phenomenon that biofilm colonization, including bacteria, fungus and even archaea, at the metal/electrolyte interface influences the kinetic process of the anodic or cathodic reactions, subsequently altering the corrosion rate of the metal [1\u20133]. Extensive research has confirmed that the occurrence of large engineering accidents in various fields, including but not limited to the aerospace industry, oil pipeline industry and offshore drilling platforms, is directly or indirectly related to MIC [4,5]. In-depth exploration of the mechanisms behind MIC can effectively help in avoiding significant economic losses. Given that MIC solely occurs within minute areas of microbial colonization or beneath biofilms, there are still challenges in fully explaining its mechanisms. The traditional theory of cathodic depolarization has long been employed to explain MIC phenomena caused by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) [6,7]. With the utilization of advanced characterization techniques, various mechanisms of MIC have been proposed, including the secretion of acidic metabolites, the formation of differential oxygen concentration cells and the extracellular electron transfer (EET) between the microorganisms and a metal surface [8\u201310]. So far, there are two recognized modes of the EET process: direct electron transfer (DET) and mediated electron transfer (MET). DET usually occurs via c-type cytochromes or conductive nanowires to make contact with the metal [11]. MET is achieved through the exchange of electrons between an external metal and microorganisms by soluble redox mediators or electron shuttles, such as flavonoids and quinones [12]. In recent years, EET has been recognized as a prevalent mechanism of MIC. It involves the entry of electrons\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5209. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16155209 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5209 2 of 14\ngenerated from metal oxidation into the cytoplasm and completes the respiratory processes of microorganisms [13\u201316]. In addition, an increasing number of research studies suggested that microorganisms could utilize alloying compounds within passive film of stainless steel as alternative electron acceptors, which led to the damage of the passive film [17,18]. For example, Huang et al. demonstrated that a decrease in the concentration of NO3\u2212, which served as the electron acceptor, accelerated the MIC of 304 stainless steel caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additionally, they used scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to provide a microscopic electrochemical perspective on how the electron shuttle (PYO) was involved in the MIC of 304 stainless steel [19]. Hu et al. manipulated carbon source and electron acceptor concentrations in the environment and revealed that Bacillus subtilis primarily caused the breakdown of the passive film on the stainless steel surface through EET, leading to the accelerating of the corrosion [20]. Shewanella genera, as dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria (DMRB), have been intensively investigated due to the unique respiratory versatility [21]. They reduce a wide range of organic compounds, polyvalent metal ions and solid metal oxides, including fumarate, nitrate, Fe (III), Mn (IV) and U (VI), as a part of their respiratory metabolism to obtain energy under anaerobic conditions [22]. The Mtr pathway including four multiheme c-type cytochromes (CymA, MtrA, MtrC and OmcA) and a porin-like outer membrane protein (MtrB) was reported to be associated with the ability to utilize such a wide array of electron acceptors [23,24]. MtrC and OmcA are both exposed on the outer membrane surface of the cell, allowing them to come into contact with extracellular soluble and insoluble electron acceptors [25]. The electrons from the interior of cells flow through the menaquinol pools, CymA, MtrA and MtrB, and finally through MtrC and OmcA to reach the extracellular electron acceptor [26]. A common approach in current research to investigate the role of EET in MIC is to knock out EET-related genes in bacteria and compare with the wild-type strain [27]. Li et al. conducted a study comparing the corrosion behavior of 304 stainless steel caused by a genetically manipulated strain (\u2206OmcA) and the wild-type strain of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and confirmed that the absence of the OmcA significantly impeded the EET process [28]. Reardon et al. characterized the ability to reduce ferrihydrite of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 mutants with in-frame deletions of MtrC and OmcA and demonstrated that outer-membrane cytochromes support a role for electron transfer from cell to the mineral [29]. Shewanella algae is a common bacterium in marine environments and has been reported to have the ability to reduce and deposit soluble metal ions such as ferrum (III), platinum (IV) and palladium (II) from dilute solutions [30,31]. In this work, we elucidated the role of EET in the MIC of 201 stainless steel (SS) caused by S. algae through modulating the concentration of electron acceptors in the culture medium and constructing mutant strains (\u2206OmcA) lacking the gene encoding the cytochrome OmcA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive spectroscopy detector (EDS) were used to observe the morphology and the composition of the 201 SS surface after 7 days of immersion. The concentrations of Fe2+ in various media were obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The corrosion behavior was characterized by potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The surface topography and the contact potential difference (VCPD) distribution on the coupons immersed in the medium inoculated with \u2206OmcA were obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM)."

The 50% fumarate group meant 1.6 g/L disodium fumarate in the medium. Before autoclaving at 121 \u25e6C for 20 min, the pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 7.05 \u00b1 0.05. The medium was then deoxygenated by injecting pure nitrogen for 30 min. Subsequently, 1 mL seed culture of S. algae was inoculated in a 100 mL SBM and the flask was sealed with a rubber stopper in the anaerobic chamber. Three parallel coupons were set for each group of tests and the average value and standard deviation are shown in results. The optical density value at 600 nm (OD600) was measured by a UV spectrophotometer (Bio Mate3S, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to reflect the growth of S. algae. The mutant strains (\u2206OmcA) lacking the gene encoding the cytochrome OmcA were constructed in the wild-type S. algae using homologous recombination techniques. Briefly, the first step was to design primers based on the flanking sequences of the target gene, and then perform the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification. The product was used as a template for the overlap extension PCR and the overlaps were spliced to obtain the sequence lacking the target gene. The sequence was inserted into the pRE112 vector using the restriction endonuclease SmaI-KpnI, completing the construction of the recombinant plasmid. The recombinant plasmid was then transformed into the Escherichia coli S17 \u03bbpir and positive colonies were selected using chloramphenicol-containing agar plates. The positive colonies were mixed with S. algae in a 1:1 ratio so that the target gene deletion was achieved through biparental conjugation. Finally, the mutant strains (\u2206OmcA) were obtained through a two-step selection using chloramphenicol and 10% (w/v) sucrose agar plates [32]."

In the 100% fumarate medium, the OD600 value of S. algae gradually increased throughout the 7-day cultivation period. In the 50% fumarate medium, the OD600 value of S. algae was similar to that in the 100% fumarate medium on the first day and there was a gradual decline as the cultivation time progressed. According to the analysis of variance, p < 0.05 indicated a significant difference between the two groups. There was a significant difference in the number of bacteria after 7 days of immersion. This was due to the lower concentration of electron acceptors in the solution, which slightly restricted the EET activity of the planktonic bacteria and limited the energy acquisition and growth. Figure 1b depicts the variation of pH value for different media. The pH value of both media slightly decreased over the time, which related to little acidic microbial metabolites. The near-neutral environment eliminated the interference of acidic microbial metabolites in the corrosion of the steels. The pH value of the two media did not differ significantly over the 7-day immersion.\nMaterials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Growth\u00a0curves\u00a0of\u00a0S.\u00a0algae\u00a0and\u00a0(b)\u00a0pH\u00a0variation\u00a0in\u00a0various\u00a0fumarate\u00a0concentration\u00a0me-\ndium.\u00a0\n3.2.\u00a0Surface\u00a0Morphology\u00a0 Figure\u00a0 2\u00a0 shows\u00a0 the\u00a0 SEM\u00a0 images\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 201\u00a0 SS\u00a0 coupons\u00a0 immersed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 100%\u00a0 fumarate\u00a0medium\u00a0 inoculated\u00a0with\u00a0S.\u00a0algae.\u00a0After\u00a01\u00a0day\u00a0of\u00a0 immersion,\u00a0 the\u00a0bacteria\u00a0dispersed\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0surface\u00a0and\u00a0aggregated\u00a0on\u00a0local\u00a0areas\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0(Figure\u00a02a).\u00a0As\u00a0 the\u00a0immersion\u00a0time\u00a0reached\u00a03\u00a0days,\u00a0the\u00a0density\u00a0of\u00a0bacteria\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0increased\u00a0(Figure\u00a0 2b).\u00a0After\u00a07\u00a0days\u00a0of\u00a0immersion,\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0sessile\u00a0bacteria\u00a0further\u00a0increased\u00a0and\u00a0localized\u00a0dense\u00a0biofilms\u00a0formed\u00a0(Figure\u00a02c).\u00a0Some\u00a0corrosion\u00a0pits\u00a0were\u00a0observed\u00a0around\u00a0the\u00a0 sessile\u00a0bacteria\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0coupon\u2019s\u00a0surface\u00a0(Figures\u00a02d\u00a0and\u00a03a).\u00a0Within\u00a0the\u00a0area\u00a0spanning\u00a0the\u00a0 corrosion\u00a0pit\u00a0(white\u00a0dashed\u00a0line),\u00a0an\u00a0EDS\u00a0line\u00a0scan\u00a0was\u00a0performed\u00a0on\u00a0Fe,\u00a0Cr\u00a0and\u00a0O\u00a0elements\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a03b\u2013d.\u00a0The\u00a0O\u00a0element\u00a0content\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0corrosion\u00a0 pit\u00a0area\u00a0was\u00a0only\u00a020%\u00a0of\u00a0 that\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0other\u00a0regions,\u00a0while\u00a0 the\u00a0corresponding\u00a0Fe\u00a0and\u00a0Cr\u00a0 element\u00a0contents\u00a0were\u00a0increased\u00a0by\u00a0approximately\u00a015%.\u00a0The\u00a0line\u00a0scan\u00a0results\u00a0were\u00a0caused\u00a0 by\u00a0the\u00a0rupture\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0passive\u00a0film\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0surface,\u00a0which\u00a0led\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0exposure\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 underlying\u00a0substrate.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a02.\u00a0SEM\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0immersed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0100%\u00a0fumarate\u00a0medium\u00a0inoculated\u00a0with\u00a0S.\u00a0algae\u00a0 for\u00a0(a)\u00a01\u00a0day,\u00a0(b)\u00a03\u00a0days\u00a0and\u00a0(c,d)\u00a07\u00a0days.\u00a0\nFigure 1.

            "text": "Figure 5 shows the potentiodynamic polarization curves of the coupons in the sterile medium and the inoculated media with various fumarate concentrations after 7 days of immersion. After immersing in the sterile medium for 7 days, the passivation current density (ipass) of 201 stainless steel was 0.13 \u00b5A and the pitting potential (Epit) was 0.76 V, indicating good corrosion resistance of the steel in the sterile medium. In comparison to the sterile medium, the ipass of the coupon in the 100% fumarate medium inoculated with S. algae increased to 3.3 \u00b5A and Epit decreased to 0.37 V. When the electron acceptor in the culture medium was halved, the Epit of the 201 SS coupon further decreased to 0.15 V, while ipass increased to 7.2 \u00b5A. The results from the potentiodynamic polarization curves indicate that S. algae cells accelerated the degradation of the passive film. The lack of an electron acceptor made the biofilm more corrosive to the passive film. These results were consistent with the ICP results.\nTo comprehensively understand the effect of electron acceptor concentration on the MIC of stainless steel caused by S. algae, a non-destructive EIS test was used to observe the corrosion behavior of 201 SS in the 100% fumarate- and 50% fumarate-inoculated media at different immersion times (Figure 6). The diameter of the capacitive loops of the steel in the 50% fumarate medium was consistently smaller than that in the 100% fumarate medium at the same immersion time. The diameter of the capacitive loops in the low-frequency region of the Nyquist plots showed a significant decrease after 1 day of immersion in both media, followed by a slight increase with prolonged immersion time. Correspondingly, the Bode plots showed that the impedance modulus in the low-frequency region (|Z|0.01 Hz) exhibited consistent variation patterns as capacitive loops. The larger diameter of a capacitive loop and higher |Z|0.01 Hz value are commonly used as indicators of better corrosion resistance [34]. Two time constants were observed in the phase angle\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5209 7 of 14\nplots of the coupons immersed in both media, including one for the passive film with biofilm attachment and the other for the charge transfer process of the electrical double layer formed at the interface of the metal substrate and the medium.\nMaterials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nindicating\u00a0good\u00a0corrosion\u00a0resistance\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0steel\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0sterile\u00a0medium.\u00a0In\u00a0comparison\u00a0to\u00a0 the\u00a0sterile\u00a0medium,\u00a0the\u00a0ipass\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0coupon\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0100%\u00a0fumarate\u00a0medium\u00a0inoculated\u00a0with\u00a0 S.\u00a0algae\u00a0increased\u00a0to\u00a03.3\u00a0\u00b5A\u00a0and\u00a0Epit\u00a0decreased\u00a0to\u00a00.37\u00a0V.\u00a0When\u00a0the\u00a0electron\u00a0acceptor\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0 culture\u00a0medium\u00a0was\u00a0halved,\u00a0the\u00a0Epit\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0coupon\u00a0further\u00a0decreased\u00a0to\u00a00.15\u00a0V,\u00a0while\u00a0 ipass\u00a0increased\u00a0to\u00a07.2\u00a0\u00b5A.\u00a0The\u00a0results\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0potentiodynamic\u00a0polarization\u00a0curves\u00a0indicate\u00a0 that\u00a0S.\u00a0algae\u00a0 ells\u00a0accelerated\u00a0the\u00a0degradation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0passive\u00a0film.\u00a0The\u00a0lack\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0electron\u00a0 acceptor\u00a0m de\u00a0the\u00a0biofilm\u00a0m re\u00a0corrosiv \u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0passive\u00a0film.\u00a0The e\u00a0results\u00a0were\u00a0consistent\u00a0 with\u00a0the\u00a0ICP\u00a0results.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05.\u00a0The\u00a0potentiodynamic\u00a0polarization\u00a0curves\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0coupon\u00a0 immersed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0sterile\u00a0\nmedium\u00a0and\u00a0inoculated\u00a0media\u00a0containing\u00a0S.\u00a0algae\u00a0with\u00a0various\u00a0fumarate\u00a0concentrations.\u00a0\nTo\u00a0comprehensively\u00a0understand\u00a0the\u00a0effect\u00a0of\u00a0electron\u00a0acceptor\u00a0concentration\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0 MIC\u00a0of\u00a0stainless\u00a0steel\u00a0caused\u00a0by\u00a0S.\u00a0algae,\u00a0a\u00a0non-destructive\u00a0EIS\u00a0test\u00a0was\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0observe\u00a0 the\u00a0corrosion\u00a0behavior\u00a0of\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0100%\u00a0fumarate-\u00a0and\u00a050%\u00a0fumarate-inoculated\u00a0media\u00a0at\u00a0different\u00a0 immersion\u00a0times\u00a0(Figure\u00a06).\u00a0The\u00a0diameter\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0capacitive\u00a0 loops\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 steel\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a050%\u00a0fumarate\u00a0medium\u00a0was\u00a0consistently\u00a0smaller\u00a0than\u00a0that\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0100%\u00a0fumarate\u00a0 medium\u00a0at\u00a0 the\u00a0same\u00a0 immersion\u00a0 time.\u00a0The\u00a0diameter\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0capacitive\u00a0 loops\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 lowfrequency\u00a0region\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Nyquist\u00a0plots\u00a0showed\u00a0a\u00a0significant\u00a0decrease\u00a0after\u00a01\u00a0day\u00a0of\u00a0immersion\u00a0in\u00a0both\u00a0media,\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0slight\u00a0increase\u00a0with\u00a0prolonged\u00a0immersion\u00a0time.\u00a0Correspondingly,\u00a0 the\u00a0Bode\u00a0plots\u00a0showed\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 impedance\u00a0modulus\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 low-frequency\u00a0 region\u00a0 (|Z|0.01\u00a0Hz)\u00a0exhibited\u00a0consistent\u00a0variation\u00a0patterns\u00a0as\u00a0capacitive\u00a0 loops.\u00a0The\u00a0 larger\u00a0 diameter\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0capacitive\u00a0loop\u00a0and\u00a0higher\u00a0|Z|0.01\u00a0Hz\u00a0value\u00a0are\u00a0commonly\u00a0used\u00a0as\u00a0indicators\u00a0 of\u00a0better\u00a0corrosion\u00a0resistance\u00a0[34].\u00a0Two\u00a0time\u00a0constants\u00a0were\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0phase\u00a0angle\u00a0 plots\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0coupons\u00a0 immersed\u00a0 in\u00a0both\u00a0media,\u00a0 including\u00a0one\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0passive\u00a0film\u00a0with\u00a0 biofilm\u00a0attachment\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0other\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0charge\u00a0transfer\u00a0process\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0electrical\u00a0double\u00a0 layer\u00a0formed\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0interface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0metal\u00a0substrate\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0medium.\u00a0\n-9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4\n-0.8\n-0.4\n0.0\n0.4 0.8 Po te nt ia l ( V)\nLog i (A cm2)\n100% fumarate 50% fumarate Sterile\nFigure 5.

The equivalent electrical circuit used to fit the EIS spectra of coupons immersed in the inoculated media for (a) 3 h, 1 day, 3 days, (b) 5 days and 7 days.\nTable 2 summarizes the fitting results for coupons in the inoculated media. After 1 day of i mersion, the coupons immersed in the 100% fumarat medium exhibited a d cr ase in Rct from (4.95 \u00b1 0.89) \u00d7 105 \u2126 cm2 to (2.81 \u00b1 0.63) \u00d7 104 \u2126 cm2, whil that immersed in the 50% fumarate medium showed a decrease from (3.38 \u00b1 0.66) \u00d7 105 \u2126 cm2 to (2.70 \u00b1 0.48) \u00d7 104 \u2126 c 2. A the mersion time increased, the Rct value gr dually increase in both media, which is associated with the expansion and thickening of the biofilm. The r sults indic ted that the attachment and growth of bac eria during the in tial immersion p riod induced the degradation of the passive film and accelerated the corrosion of 201 SS. Th d crease in the concentration of electron acceptors in the medium led to the preference of S. algae to utilize the passive film as the alternative electron acceptor, thereby accelerating the degradation of the passive film. With the extension of immersion time, the thickening of biofilm prevented 201 SS from direct contact with the solution and reduced part of the charge transfer, which increased Rf and Rct values and slightly inhibited the corrosion of the steel.\nTable 2.

In the 100% fumarate medium, the width of the maximum corrosion pit was 17.87 \u00b5m, whereas the depth was 1.32 \u00b5m. Notably, the steel surface immersed in the 50% fumarate medium showed a much wider (33.40 \u00b5m) but shallower (0.72 \u00b5m) pit. These results suggested that the absence of fumarate primarily promoted the interaction between S. algae and the oxides within the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5209 9 of 14\npassive film, leading to the formation of wider corrosion pits.

It could be observed that \u2206OmcA attached in large quantities to the surface and formed localized biofilms on the first day of immersion (Figure 9a). By the third day, the biofilm coverage area increased and thickened (Figure 9b). After 7 days of immersion, the biofilm almost covers the entire surface of the 201 SS (Figure 9c). Compared to the wild-type S. algae, \u2206OmcA had a shorter length and a higher number of sessile cells on the steel and few corrosion pits could be observed around the cells (Figure 9d). The SEM results showed that the growth of \u2206OmcA was not affected by knocking out related genes and the number of sessile cells was more than S. algae.\nFigure 10 presents the potentiodynamic polarization curve of the 201 SS coupon in the medium inoculated with \u2206OmcA after 7 days of immersion. Compared to the coupon immersed in the sterile medium, the coupon immersed in the \u2206OmcA-inoculated medium with 100% fumarate showed nearly identical Epit (0.74 V), which was significantly higher than that immersed in the S. algae-inoculated medium (0.37 V). The coupon in the \u2206OmcAinoculated medium had an ipass of 1.12 \u00b5A, which falls between the ipass values of coupons immersed in the sterile medium and the S. algae-inoculated medium. \u2206OmcA cells slightly accelerated the MIC of the steel, but it was much weaker than that mediated by S. algae.\nFigure 11 shows the Nyquist and Bode plots of 201 SS in the 100% fumarate medium inoculated by \u2206OmcA at different immersion times. In the Nyquist plots, the diameter of the capacitive loops in the low-frequency region continuously decreased during the initial immersion period, which increased by the 5th and 7th days of immersion. The same equivalent electrical circuit in Figure 7a was used to fit the EIS results after 3 h of immersion and that in Figure 7b was used to fit the remaining results. The fitting results are summarized in Table 3. After 1 day of immersion, the Rct of the coupons in the medium inoculated with \u2206OmcA decreased from (9.84 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 106 \u2126 cm2 to (1.78 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 106 \u2126 cm2. It reached the lowest value of (1.75 \u00b1 0.12) \u00d7 105 \u2126 cm2 after 3 days of immersion. This indicated\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5209 10 of 14\nthat \u2206OmcA had a certain degree of corrosion-accelerating effect on the steel during the first 3 days of immersion, but this effect was significantly weaker than that of S. algae (Figure 6). When the lowest corrosion resistance of 201 SS induced by \u2206OmcA appeared, it took a longer time and the corrosion rate was slower. Based on the electrochemical test results, it was evident that S. algae obviously exacerbated the degradation of the passive film. However, when the protein OmcA which is associated with the electron transfer pathway was absent, the MIC of the steel was noticeably weakened. In our recent study [35], we found that the VCPD drop of the passive film occurred at the locations of the adherent S. algae using AFM and suggested that the VCPD drop should be resulted from the electrons injected into the passive film from cells. Herein, AFM was also used to further investigate the potential around \u2206OmcA on the 201 SS surface after 3 days of immersion as shown in Figure 12. The morphology and sizes of the cells in\nFigure 12a were consistent with the SEM observation (Figure 9). In the VCPD distribution map, no VCPD drop region was observed in the vicinity of the bacteria (Figure 12b). The area outlined by the white dashed line was selected for detailed analysis (Figure 12c,d). The VCPD of the passive film around \u2206OmcA was almost the same as that without bacterial attachment, indicating that the ability of bacteria to transfer electrons to the passive film was significantly reduced in the absence of the c-type cytochrome OmcA. This also caused a slow degradation rate of the passive film, and the MIC of stainless steel was inhibited.\nMaterials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a08.\u00a0The\u00a0morphology\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0maximum\u00a0corrosion\u00a0pit\u00a0on\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0coupons\u00a0after\u00a07\u00a0days\u00a0of\u00a0immersion\u00a0(a,b)\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0100%\u00a0fumarate\u00a0medium\u00a0and\u00a0(c,d)\u00a0the\u00a050%\u00a0fumarate\u00a0medium.\u00a0The\u00a0yellow\u00a0dashed\u00a0 lines\u00a0mark\u00a0the\u00a0location\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0line\u00a0scan\u00a0results\u00a0of\u00a0depth.\u00a0The\u00a0blue\u00a0dashed\u00a0lines\u00a0mark\u00a0the\u00a0width\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0depth\u00a0of\u00a0corrosion\u00a0pits.\u00a0\n3.5.\u00a0Corrosion\u00a0Behavior\u00a0of\u00a0\u0394OmcA\u00a0 Figure\u00a0 9\u00a0pres nts\u00a0 the\u00a0 SEM\u00a0 images\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 201\u00a0 SS\u00a0 coupons\u00a0 immersed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 100%\u00a0 fumarate\u00a0medium\u00a0inoculated\u00a0with\u00a0\u0394OmcA.\u00a0It\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0observed\u00a0that\u00a0\u0394OmcA\u00a0attached\u00a0in\u00a0 large\u00a0quantities\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0and\u00a0formed\u00a0localized\u00a0biofilms\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0day\u00a0of\u00a0immersion\u00a0\n(Figure\u00a09a).\u00a0By\u00a0the\u00a0third\u00a0day,\u00a0the\u00a0biofilm\u00a0coverage\u00a0area\u00a0increased\u00a0and\u00a0thickened\u00a0(Figure\u00a0\n9b).\u00a0After\u00a07\u00a0days\u00a0of\u00a0immersion,\u00a0the\u00a0biofilm\u00a0almost\u00a0covers\u00a0the\u00a0entire\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0\n(Figure\u00a09c).\u00a0Compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0wild-type\u00a0S.\u00a0algae,\u00a0\u0394OmcA\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0shorter\u00a0length\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0higher\u00a0\nnumber\u00a0of\u00a0sessile\u00a0cells\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0steel\u00a0and\u00a0few\u00a0corrosion\u00a0pits\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0observed\u00a0around\u00a0the\u00a0\ncells\u00a0(Figure\u00a09d).\u00a0The\u00a0SEM\u00a0results\u00a0sh wed\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0growth\u00a0of\u00a0\u0394OmcA\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0affected\u00a0by\u00a0\nkn ckin \u00a0out\u00a0related\u00a0genes\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0sessile\u00a0cells\u00a0wa \u00a0more\u00a0than\u00a0S.\u00a0algae.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a09.\u00a0SEM\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0immersed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0100%\u00a0fumarate\u00a0medium\u00a0inoculated\u00a0with\u00a0\u0394OmcA\u00a0 for\u00a0(a)\u00a01\u00a0day,\u00a0(b)\u00a03\u00a0days\u00a0and\u00a0(c,d)\u00a07\u00a0days.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a010\u00a0presents\u00a0the\u00a0potentiodynamic\u00a0polarization\u00a0curve\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0201\u00a0SS\u00a0coupon\u00a0in\u00a0 the\u00a0medium\u00a0inoculated\u00a0with\u00a0\u0394OmcA\u00a0after\u00a07\u00a0days\u00a0of\u00a0immersion.\u00a0Compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0coupon\u00a0 immersed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0sterile\u00a0medium,\u00a0the\u00a0coupon\u00a0immersed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0\u0394OmcA-inoculated\u00a0medium\u00a0 with\u00a0100%\u00a0fumarate\u00a0showed\u00a0nearly\u00a0identical\u00a0Epit\u00a0(0.74\u00a0V),\u00a0which\u00a0was\u00a0significantly\u00a0higher\u00a0 than\u00a0that\u00a0immersed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0S.\u00a0algae-inoculated\u00a0medium\u00a0(0.37\u00a0V).\u00a0The\u00a0coupon\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0\u0394OmcAinoculated\u00a0medium\u00a0had\u00a0an\u00a0ipass\u00a0of\u00a01.12\u00a0\u00b5A,\u00a0which\u00a0falls\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0ipass\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0coupons\u00a0 immersed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0sterile\u00a0medium\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0S.\u00a0algae-inoculated\u00a0medium.\u00a0\u0394OmcA\u00a0cells\u00a0slightly\u00a0 accelerated\u00a0the\u00a0MIC\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0steel,\u00a0but\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0much\u00a0weaker\u00a0than\u00a0that\u00a0mediated\u00a0by\u00a0S.\u00a0algae.\u00a0\nigure 9.

            "text": "This work investigated the role of EET in the MIC of 201 stainless steel caused by S. algae via modulating the concentration of electron acceptor in the medium and constructing mutant strains by \u2206OmcA. The major conclusions were obtained as follows:\n1. According to the results of the potentiodynamic polarization curves and the ICP-MS, 201 stainless steels corroded slowly in the sterile medium. The presence of S. algae enhanced the dissolution of the Fe oxides in the passive film and decreased the pitting potential of the steel, leading to the degradation of the passive film. 2. The results of EIS and the morphologies of the maximum corrosion pits revealed that corrosion acceleration of 201 stainless steel was most obvious in the 50% fumarate medium in the presence of S. algae. The lack of an electron acceptor further aggravated the degradation of the passive film and mainly affected the early stage of MIC. 3. In the absence of the c-type cytochrome OmcA, MIC of the 201 stainless steels induced by \u2206OmcA was significantly weakened as manifested by the potentiodynamic polarization curves, EIS and AFM characterization. It further confirmed the important role of OmcA related to EET in the MIC of 201 stainless steel.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.W., T.C. and H.Q.; Methodology, H.Z., Y.L. and T.C.; Investigation, W.C., T.C., J.G. and S.Z.; Writing\u2014original draft, W.C.; Writing\u2014review & editing, W.C., H.Q. and D.G.; Supervision, X.W., H.Z., H.Q., Y.L. and D.G.
