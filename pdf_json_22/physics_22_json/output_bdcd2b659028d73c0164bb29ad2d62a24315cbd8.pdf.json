    "abstractText": "The fine structure of a streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition in a single\u2013shot high\u2013voltage nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharge (nSDBD) in molecular nitrogen at pressure P = 6 bar was studied with the help of ICCD microimaging. An intermediate discharge structure, existing for only a few nanoseconds, was observed in the time interval between two discharge modes: streamer discharge, with a typical electron density of ne \u223c 10 cm\u22123, and filamentary discharge, with ne \u223c 10 cm\u22123. The structure was observed for both polarities of the high\u2013voltage electrode. The structure can be briefly described as a stochastic appearance of thin channels propagating a bit faster than the main ionization front of merged surface streamers, transforming in a few nanoseconds in a bi\u2013directional ionization wave. One wave, which we associate with a feather\u2013like structure in optical emission, propagates further away from the high\u2013voltage electrode, and another, a backward wave of emission, propagates back towards the edge of the high\u2013voltage electrode. When the backward wave of emission almost reaches the high\u2013voltage electrode, the filament appears. Plasma properties of the observed structure were studied to better understand the nature of a streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition. Theoretical analysis suggests that the instability of a flat front of ionization wave (Laplacian instability) triggers the streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition, and that a surface stem (a tiny region with enhanced electron density) should be in the origin of the bi-directional ionization wave.",

            "text": "high\u2013voltage nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharge (nSDBD) in molecular nitrogen at pressure P = 6 bar was studied with the help of ICCD microimaging. An intermediate discharge structure, existing for only a few nanoseconds, was observed in the time interval between two discharge modes: streamer discharge, with a typical electron density of ne \u223c 1015 cm\u22123, and filamentary discharge, with ne \u223c 1019 cm\u22123. The structure was observed for both polarities of the high\u2013voltage electrode. The structure can be briefly described as a stochastic appearance of thin channels propagating a bit faster than the main ionization front of merged surface streamers, transforming in a few nanoseconds in a bi\u2013directional ionization wave. One wave, which we associate with a feather\u2013like structure in optical emission, propagates further away from the high\u2013voltage electrode, and another, a backward wave of emission, propagates back towards the edge of the high\u2013voltage electrode. When the backward wave of emission almost reaches the high\u2013voltage electrode, the filament appears. Plasma properties of the observed structure were studied to better understand the nature of a streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition. Theoretical analysis suggests that the instability of a flat front of ionization wave (Laplacian instability) triggers the streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition, and that a surface stem (a tiny region with enhanced electron density) should be in the origin of the bi-directional ionization wave.\nKeywords: streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition, nanosecond surface dielectric barrier\ndischarge, micro\u2013scale, bi\u2013directional ionization wave\nIntroduction\nFor over a century [1, 2], research in the field of dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) has been supported by various applications. According to different electrode configurations, DBDs can be divided into volume discharges, surface discharges and coplanar discharges [3]. Already implemented and in development applications of DBDs include plasma catalysis [4], air pollution control [5\u20137], light source generation [8, 9], materials processing for microelectronics and photovoltaic cells [10], medical equipment disinfection [11], plasma\u2013assisted flow control [12\u201314], plasma\u2013assisted ignition and combustion [15\u201318], etc.\nStudying high\u2013pressure discharges for the needs of plasma-assisted ignition, it was\nfound [19] that, with an increase in pressure and/or voltage, the nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharge (nSDBD) transforms from a streamer mode, typical for ambient conditions, into a filamentary mode. As a result, starting with a streamer mode, the discharge transforms into a set of filaments, separated by a distance of \u223c1 mm or less, propagating away from the high\u2013voltage electrode. This streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition was observed in single\u2013shot experiments for a wide range of pressures [19] and gas mixtures [20, 21], on different dielectrics and different electrode materials [22]. At the moment of transition, during 1\u22122 nanoseconds, the emission spectrum changes from streamer\u2013like emission, containing mainly the molecular bands of N2, to the continuous wavelength (cw) emission with well distinguished broadened lines of neutral (N, O, H) and singly ionized atoms, mainly N+. The continuous wavelength emission comes from the narrow near\u2013axis zone of the filament. The electron density during the transition increases, during a few nanoseconds, from ne \u223c 1015 cm\u22123 to ne \u223c 1018\u22121019 cm\u22123, and then a slow decay of the electron density, a few tens of nanoseconds long, is observed. The specific delivered energy is extremely high for the filamentary mode, more than 5 eV/particle [23], and does not depend upon applied voltage. According to theoretical consideration and numerical modeling [23], complete or almost complete dissociation, and plasma close to local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions, are achieved in the filaments.\nIt should be noted that fast transition from low to high electron density and similar\nplasma parameters were also observed in bulk nanosecond discharges [24\u201327]. Work that was \u201cahead of its time\u201d are the articles [24,25] published in 1977. In 1977, Stritzke et al. [24] made spatial and temporal spectroscopy measurements on the streamer\u2013 to\u2013spark transition in nitrogen (0.4 bar) on a plane-to-plane electrode system with a 2 cm gap. They observed the second positive system of molecular nitrogen (SPS), N2 (C 3\u03a0u \u2192 B3\u03a0g) in the emitted light. The electron density was found to be increasing from 1011 cm\u22123 to 1016 cm\u22123 with the heating of the plasma channel. A few nanoseconds after closing the gap, intense dissociation and ionization provided a strong continuum emission as well as a few atomic lines in the wavelength range of 300 \u2212 860 nm. At this stage, the electron temperature reached (5 \u2212 6) \u00d7 104 K and the electron density increased up to 1018 cm\u22123. Finally, the authors concluded that a LTE state had been\nestablished in the ionized plasma channel. The same year, Albrecht et al. [25] made a series of experiments on the spark discharge to study the combustion of fuel:air mixtures at atmospheric pressure. They reported that the SPS emission, peaking at 337.1 nm, was observed only at the beginning of the discharge and disappeared rapidly when closing the gap. After rising of the current, the atomic lines NII (N+), peaking at 500.6 nm, as well as the radiation of electrode material (MnII (Mn+)), peaking at 230.3 nm, are generated within a few nanoseconds, accompanied by the constriction of discharge channel. The full ionized channel has a width of a few tens of micrometers. The electron density at the thermodynamic equilibrium state was measured by the Stark broadening and reported to be as high as 1019 cm\u22123. The electron temperature was calculated from the Boltzmann plot of N+ lines and was over 5 eV.\nThe effect of the rapid, nanosecond, or even sub-nanosecond, transition from\nstreamer\u2013like to the arc\u2013like plasma has been reinvented in the last decade, while investigating the properties of short pulsed nanosecond discharges [26\u201328]. This type of discharge, obtained with pulses of a few tens of nanoseconds, was called a thermal spark [27]. Lomaev et al. [29] observed the constriction of plasma when increasing the pressure from 0.1 \u2212 4 bar to over 5 bar. In their experiments, a steel tube, 6 mm in diameter and 50 \u00b5m thick, served as the cathode, while a flat brass plate was used as the anode. The length of the discharge gap was 12 mm. The homogeneous diffuse plasma filled the volume between the cathode tube and the anode at lower pressure conditions (0.1 \u2212 4 bar). As the experiments were conducted in nitrogen with 5% of hydrogen, the strong emission of the SPS of molecular nitrogen appeared during the homogeneous discharge regime. When pressure reached 6 bar, a broadband continuum spectrum in the wavelength range of 200\u2212800 nm appeared, as well as NI (N atom) and NII atomic lines in the range of 400\u2212 800 nm. With the continuous increase of pressure from 6 bar to 12 bar, the emission intensity of atomic lines and continuum spectrum grew significantly. The contraction of the discharge channels was accompanied by a significant increase in the electron density, from 1015 cm\u22123 in diffuse mode to 1017 cm\u22123 in contracted discharge. High electron temperature, up to 3.5 eV, was observed after the breakdown happened in the gap, and dropped rapidly to \u223c 2 eV in a few nanoseconds. Similar constriction of discharge channels was reported by Shao et al. in [28] where a tube\u2013to\u2013plane electrode configuration was used. They saw a contraction of the discharge channels when increasing the gas pressure or shortening the gap between the electrodes. At the initial stage, before the transition, there were a few spots on the cathode. A few nanoseconds later, the spark channels was first generated on the anode and propagated towards the middle of the gap. The authors believed that it was the propagation of the spark leaders from the anode that bridged the discharge gap. Analogously, the spectra before breakdown were dominated by the SPS of molecular nitrogen, while after the gap was bridged, mainly the continuum and NII, NI and OI (O atom) spectra, as well as the atomic lines from electrode materials, were observed.\nNanosecond repetitive pulsed (NRP) discharge at atmospheric pressure in sub-\nmillimeter gaps (0.1-1 mm) was studied by Orriere et al. [26,30]. The authors showed a\nsharp increase of the electron density to 1\u00d7 1019 cm\u22123, corresponding to an ionization fraction of air of 0.5. After reaching its maximum value, ne decayed slowly with a characteristic recombination time of \u223c 90 ns. This is consistent with a slow relaxation of the electron temperature Te and the nearly complete ionization and dissociation of the gas in the microplasma. The electron temperature was measured to be 72 kK at 5 ns after the end of the voltage pulse.\nMinesi et al. [27] very recently observed the formation of highly ionized plasma\nchannels in experiments performed at pressures ranging from 58 mbar to 1 bar. After ignition of the discharge, a diffuse plasma was generated between anode and cathode within 1.25 ns and first appeared near the anode. Then, a filament with higher emission intensity originated on the edge of the cathode within 1 ns. Because of limitations of the ICCD camera, the authors were not able to resolve the appearance of the filament. Immediately after, the fully ionized filamentary discharge also appeared on the anode. Finally, as a result of the continuous propagation of filaments from both cathode and anode to the middle of the gap, the discharge channel closed the gap between two electrodes a few nanoseconds after the ignition. When the breakdown happened in the gap, the electron temperature was as high as 4.1 eV and the peak electron density was equal to 4\u00d71019 cm\u22123. The authors suggested four different stages of the NRP discharge development as a function of specific delivered energy, namely NRP\u2013corona, NRP\u2013glow, NRP\u2013spark and NRP\u2013thermal spark. The NRP\u2013thermal spark in pin\u2013to\u2013pin geometry is very similar in parameters to filaments in nSDBD discharge.\nA distinctive feature of filamentation in SDBD is that, unlike a single plasma\nchannel formed in volume discharges [24\u201327], a streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition in SDBDs always occurs in a multichannel mode and is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the number of plasma channels observed in the streamer form before the transition. In addition, the transition to the NRP-thermal spark mode is observed when the primary streamer channel has already crossed the gap, while in SDBD there is no gap closure. Based on this, it should be expected that some important features of the SDBD filamentation mechanism differ significantly from the mechanism of thermal spark formation in single channel volume discharges.\nNo convincing theoretical model of streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition in SDBD exists\nfor the moment. It should be noted that the problem is essentially 3-dimensional. Recently, propagation of nSDBD streamers in high-pressure air (P = 6 atm), under conditions close to the experiments of the present paper, was studied numerically [31]. A high-pressure positive streamer was simulated, using a 2D approximation, up to the moment corresponding to streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition in experiments. Secondary ionization waves were observed: they formed near the high-voltage electrode (anode) and propagated along the dielectric surface in the immediate vicinity of this surface, at a distance of less than 10 \u00b5m. The reason for the formation of such secondary ionization waves is not yet fully understood, but they hardly can be the origin of the streamer-to-filament transition. Indeed, it was experimentally shown that transition to the filamentary mode of nSDBD [23] or to the thermal spark mode of volumetric\ndischarge [27] requires a very high ionization degree, capable of initiating the transition of the discharge to the LTE mode. At the same time, the appearance of secondary ionization waves near the dielectric surface in simulations [31] occurred in regions where the electron density was extremely low, which makes the transition to the LTE state extremely unlikely within the physical model [31]. The aim of this work is to study in detail the features of the streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition in high pressure nSDBD at positive and negative polarity: the morphology of the discharge before and after the transition, typical dimensions of plasma channels and, most importantly, find the point of origin of the filament."

For the set of experiments on optical emission spectra, the disc has been purposely replaced by a same diameter gear. The internal diameter of the low\u2013voltage grounded electrode was equal to the diameter of the high\u2013voltage electrode, and the external diameter of the low\u2013voltage electrode was equal to 50 mm. A thin 0.3 mm dielectric layer (PVC, \u03b5 \u2248 3 \u2212 3.5) was glued to the grounded electrode by Geocel FIXER Mate silicon glue (\u03b5 \u2248 3). The thickness of the glue layer was 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm, giving a total thickness for the dielectric of 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 mm.\nThe electrode system was mounted into a constant\u2013volume high\u2013pressure chamber having 3 quartz optical windows of 5 cm diameter each (see figure 1 (b)). One optical window was situated in front of the electrode. The images of the discharge, as well as the optical emission spectra, were acquired through the front window. Two other windows allowed the observation of the discharge from the side. The discharge chamber was pumped down to \u223c 10\u22123 Torr before the experiments; molecular nitrogen (Air Liquide) with < 100 ppm of impurities was used. The experiments were performed in a single\u2013shot regime at ambient initial temperature. In particular cases when accumulation of the signal was needed, the repetitive frequency of the discharge did not exceed 1 Hz. The images (\u03bb = 250 \u2212 800 nm) were taken by a Pi-Max4 Princeton Instruments ICCD camera. Optical emission spectra in the range 300-700 nm were recorded by an ACTON spectrometer (SP-2500i, 600 I/mm and 1200 I/mm gratings) and the ICCD camera. The synchronization of the ICCD camera was provided by the signal from a special back current shunt [33] soldered in the shielding of the high-voltage cable 1 m apart from the high-voltage generator. The accuracy of synchronization of the highvoltage signal coming to the electrode and ICCD camera was within 0.2 ns. A Long distance microscope QM1 LDM (LaVision) was used to observe the discharge at a micrometer scale. The LDMs, widely used in combustion research, allow a high magnification and resolution while maintaining low aberrations and a long working distance, 52 \u2212 180 cm in our case. By working principle, the QM1 LDM is a Maksutov-\nCassegrain catadioptric telescope, the scheme of which is presented in figure 2 (a). A typical depth of field with standard optics comprises part of a millimeter (800\u00b130 \u00b5m for the focal distance 52 cm). When needed, one or more Barlow lenses (a concave diverging lens that increases artificially the focal distance of the optical setup) were added between the LDM and the ICCD to achieve a higher magnification. The best resolution achieved by the system was 1.1 \u2212 2 \u00b5m/pxl, depending upon the focal distance. A part of the gear\u2013shaped high\u2013voltage electrode is shown in figure 2 (b).

The direction of observation was perpendicular to the surface of the dielectric.\nVoltage and current were monitored in each experiment. The voltage waveforms\nwere obtained with the help of a calibrated back current shunt BCS#1 installed in the middle of the cable, the technique is described in details elsewhere [34]. Current through plasma was calculated subtracting the capacitive current from the total current measured by the back current shunts.

            "text": "To select the experimental conditions properly, a special set of images with a high spatial resolution (7.6 \u00b5m/pxl) has been taken. The results were compared with the previous data on streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition [21]. The data were taken for negative (figure 4) and positive (figure 5) polarities of the discharge, for a disk\u2013shaped high\u2013 voltage electrode with a smooth edge, and for a gear\u2013shaped electrode. For the whole set of experiments, the ICCD camera gate was equal to 1 ns, and the time delay from\nthe beginning of the discharge was progressively increased with a step of 1 ns. The time instants are indicated below the frames.\nIt is clearly seen that for both types of electrodes, the picture of transition is similar\nqualitatively, the voltage of transition being slightly lower for the gear\u2013shaped electrode. At 11 ns, for the electrode with a smooth edge, the discharge stays a streamer discharge at a voltage amplitude on the electrode of U = \u00b125 kV, and well\u2013developed filaments are observed for U = \u00b132 kV. Corresponding frames are marked with orange and yellow triangles respectively. When using the gear\u2013shaped electrode the transition voltage is lowered, the filaments are already observed at U = \u00b125 kV, but the general picture of the streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition remains the same.\nFigure 6 summarizes the transition curves for nitrogen in the system with the\nsmooth\u2013edge electrode. The transition curves were obtained by ICCD imaging of the discharge with a 12 ns gate starting at the beginning of the discharge. While varying the pressure and voltage gradually, we analyzed the ICCD images obtained. The transition point was defined when 3 to 5 filaments started to appear. The transition\ncurves for both polarities intersect at the point P = 6 bar, the transition voltage being around Utr = \u00b130 kV. Orange and yellow triangles indicate conditions similar to the corresponding frames in the figures 4, 5.\nAiming to change the minimum number of parameters from experiment to\nexperiment, we have chosen pressure P = 6 bar as the base one. Since it was necessary to fix the starting point of the plasma channel for carrying out spectroscopic studies, the gear electrode was used in further experiments. For all the experiments presented in this work, it was verified that the results remain qualitatively the same in the case of a discharge starting from the smooth edge or the disk\u2013shaped electrode."

The spectra are corrected for system spectral sensitivity.\nAt t = 2 \u2212 4 ns, the width of plasma is limited by the opening of the slit. Then,\nthe discharge channel constricts, but because the time of constriction or of propagation of the channel is smaller than the minimum available gate of the ICCD camera, 0.5 ns, we are not able to register the process. At t = 6 ns, the diameter of the plasma channel is much smaller than the initial one and a feather\u2013like structure is observed at the front of the propagating plasma channel. At t = 8 \u2212 10 ns, the filament is almost formed but diffuse plasma is still observed near the high-voltage electrode. A typical length of the diffuse region is 0.5 \u2212 0.7 mm. Finally, at t = 8 \u2212 10 ns, the filament \u201dtouches\u201d the high\u2013voltage electrode. We intentionally used the same geometry, first for ICCD imaging through the slit of the spectrometer, and then for taking spectra, keeping the entrance slit as narrow as possible at the condition that the filament is not cut by the slit. To get a spectrum, we had to collect \u223c 1000 accumulations. Four specific moments (t =4, 6, 11 and 16 ns) were selected for comparing the changes in spectral composition during the streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition. An integrated ICCD image taken at zero order of diffraction grating is displayed on the left side of each figure. The spectrum corresponding to this image in the wavelength range of 300\u2013600 nm is shown on the right side of each figure. The spectra are corrected for the spectral sensitivity of the system. As indicated above and shown in the ICCD image, the discharge at t = 4 ns is a \u201dclassical\u201d surface streamer nanosecond dielectric barrier discharge (nSDBD) [20]. The image is restricted by the opening of the slit. The spectrum contains second positive system of nitrogen (SPS N2: C3\u03a0u \u2192 B3\u03a0g) with the highest peak at a wavelength of \u03bb =337 nm. The spectrum in the wavelength range over 450 nm does not give any information but shows the electrical and optical noise. The next frame shows the ICCD image and the spectrum for the time instant t = 6 ns. The change in the morphology of the plasma channel is clearly visible: the streamer separates into two regions: a thin channel sometimes not reaching the electrode, marked as region I (a bright spot is quite often observed on the electrode edge, a thin channel can reach or not this spot), and a feather\u2013like structure on the front of the plasma channel, or region II. The spectra for regions I and II are similar in composition but different in intensity. Due to almost 5 times higher emission intensity in the region II, we can identify more bands of the second positive system. At time t = 11 ns, the channel of the filamentary plasma and the near\u2013electrode plasma have just been connected via a discharge channel with the same diameter as a filament. The diameter is already constant over the length of the discharge channel. Three components are distinguishable in the spectrum, albeit noisy: the second positive system of nitrogen, CN molecular emission of violet system and the continuous wavelength (cw) spectrum. The SPS of nitrogen is a \u201dfootprint\u201d of a streamer discharge. Three molecular bands of C3\u03a0u \u2192 B3\u03a0g, 0 \u2212 0, 0 \u2212 1 and 0 \u2212 2 still can be seen from the spectrum. Note that CN molecular band of a violet system is present in the spectra of the filaments of the negative polarity discharge [20]. Some amount of carbon atoms can appear because of non\u2013ideal pumping and partial ablation of the surface of the\ndielectric. CN violet system is known to be observed under re\u2013entry conditions, nondirectly indicating to a possible high temperature.\nAt t = 16 ns, a well\u2013developed filament with a constant diameter along the channel\nis already formed. The spectrum contains continuous wave (cw) emission and the CN molecular band of the violet system. The second positive system of nitrogen is no longer observed. This can be due to two reasons: (a) sharp decrease of E/N and so not enough energy to excite N2(C 3\u03a0u) state; (b) complete dissociation of N2; and this can be a combination of considered cases (a) and (b).\nSimilar experiments were carried out at positive polarity, U = 25 kV in 6 bar\nnitrogen. Second positive system of nitrogen can be seen clearly at the streamer phase and at the transition period. The feather\u2013like structure at the front of the filament channel, with less emission intensity compared to the negative polarity discharge, also mainly contains the SPS of N2. In the well\u2013developed filament channel, the continuous wave spectrum at positive polarity is less intense than the spectrum at negative polarity, which is in agreement with the previous work [21]. Qualitatively, spectral behavior of the streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition in 6 bar N2 is very similar for both polarities of the high\u2013voltage pulse."

            "text": "One of the reasons to select the voltage just above the transition threshold and a relatively low pressure was that the transition at these initial parameters happens relatively slowly, in a few nanoseconds instead of 1 ns or less. This allowed detailed analysis of plasma transformation in the process of transition. ICCD imaging was done for the region containing at least a few filaments to see how general the transformations during the transition are. The micro\u2013scale images of filamentary discharge at U = \u00b125 kV in N2 at 6 bar at six different time instants in the interval 2\u2212 11 ns are presented in Figure 9. From the first image, t = 2 ns, we can see the propagation of streamer discharges starting from the edge of the high\u2013voltage (HV) electrode. The electrode is indicated as the yellow dash arc in the image. The streamer propagation is shown with the grey dash arc.\nAt negative polarity, at time instant t = 5 ns, channel contraction and formation\nof a feather\u2013like structure are observed for a few randomly positioned streamers. The intensity of emission of newly formed plasma channels is high compared to surrounding streamers, a few tens of times higher. Not all of them will survive. The \u201dsurvivors\u201d will form regular a structure of equidistant channels known as filaments (t = 9 ns, t = 11 ns). The pink dash arc in each frame indicates the tip of a feather\u2013like structure. This structure, appearing at t = 5 ns, propagates further, and at 7\u2212 8 ns the emission propagating backward along the channel to the direction of the high\u2013voltage electrode is seen. We will call this\u201cbackward wave of emission\u201d.

We can see the backward emission propagates as time goes from t = 5 to t = 11 ns. At t = 11 ns, the backward wave of emission almost reaches the edge of the HV electrode. The picture of the streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition at positive polarity is similar, with the difference that the emission intensity of streamers sharply drops during their propagation, in the time interval 4 \u2212 8 ns. The feather\u2013like structure develops from a dark region about 2 mm away from the HV electrode. The backward wave of emission, starting at t = 8 ns, propagates towards the HV electrode. Similar to negative polarity, at t = 11 ns, the backward wave of emission at positive polarity almost reaches the edge of the HV electrode. The diameter of discharge channels, \u201cfull width at half maximum\u201d (FWHM) of emission intensity, is an essential parameter for analyzing the plasma properties. Two sets of experiments were done at U = \u00b125 kV, 6 bar and U = \u00b135 kV, 7 bar in nitrogen. They were intended for explaining how the experimental conditions (pressure, amplitude and polarity of applied voltage) influence the diameter of discharge channels. Each ICCD image was obtained by 50 accumulations to increase the signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio. An open\u2013source software \u201cFiji\u201d [35] was used for quantitative analysis of the ICCD micro\u2013 images, including the measurement of plasma channel diameter. An example of intensity of optical emission across the channel and corresponding ICCD image for a selected point are shown in Fig. 10b. The level of noise as well as the emission profile structure are clearly seen from the figure. To evaluate the effect of the amplitude of applied voltage and of the number of accumulations on the measured diameter of the discharge channels, two additional sets of experiments with different number of accumulations were done by varying the amplitude of the applied voltage. As shown in Figure 10, the diameter of a plasma channel in a single\u2013shot mode is almost 2.5 times smaller than the diameter calculated from the images accumulated for 50 times. It can be seen from the figure that the diameter of discharge channels practically does not depend on the amplitude of the applied voltage. We consider measurements in a single\u2013shot regime as a physical limit for the measurements of the diameter: the error at higher number of accumulations is possible because of slightly different development of a plasma channel from pulse to pulse. Knowing that the maximum possible error at 50 times averaging is almost a factor of 2, we nevertheless will continue measurements with 50 accumulations with a camera gate of 1 ns to get at least qualitative information about the temporal dynamics of the transition. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of emission intensity of plasma channels observed by ICCD camera as a function of time at 50 accumulations is plotted in figure 11 (a) for U = \u221225 kV, 6 bar discharge in nitrogen. The data are presented for different distances d from the high\u2013voltage electrode taken as a parameter. The distance d changed in the range of 160 \u00b5m \u2212 4 mm.\nIt is interesting to note that in spite of the observed constriction of the channel, the spectrum of the discharge before 9 \u2212 10 ns corresponds to the optical spectrum of\na streamer with the dominant second positive system of molecular nitrogen. The grey vertical rectangle in figure 11 (a) designates a region where the emission changes to the cw spectrum typical for the filaments. Figure 11 (b) shows the FWHM of emission of plasma channels at U = \u221235 kV, 6 bar in N2 at different positions from the HV electrode. Note that the emission intensity profiles used to calculate the diameter are less noisy at U = \u221235 kV than at U = \u221225 kV due to the higher emission intensity at higher voltage. At distances less than 500 \u00b5m from the electrode, all the curves demonstrate the same trend: the diameters of the plasma channels increase due to the expansion of streamers and then abruptly shrink\nto less than 100 \u00b5m at t = 2 \u2212 3 ns. At times after t = 4 ns, nearly everywhere along the plasma channel, the diameter is less than 100 \u00b5m. This is a \u201dfootprint\u201d of a start of a streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition.\nNote that streamers and filaments are not necessarily objects of a cylindrical shape.\nA specially designed electrode with a discharge developing on the lateral surface of the cylinder allowed to study streamers and filaments from a side view. Although measurements were done only at atmospheric pressure U = +20 kV nSDBD in air, it was found that the streamers have the dimensions of 620 \u00b5m \u00d7 270 \u00b5m; the shape is flattened in a direction perpendicular to the dielectric surface. There is therefore no reason to think that the discharge channel is cylindrical in other experimental conditions. Finally, figure 12 presents x \u2212 t diagrams obtained from the ICCD images shown in the figure 9. The propagation length of a streamer front (black curve), feather\u2013 like structure (red curve) and backward wave of emission (blue curve) are plotted for both negative and positive polarities. The absolute values of propagation velocities for streamers, feather\u2013like structures and backward emission are presented near the plots in mm/ns units. It can be seen that, for the same experimental conditions (U = \u00b125 kV, 6 bar nitrogen), the negative polarity feather\u2013like structure (red curve) propagates faster than the positive one, while the backward wave of emission propagates much slower at negative polarity. The positive polarity streamer propagates faster at the beginning, and later, during the extinction, it has almost the same velocity as the negative polarity streamer. At the same time t = 11 ns, streamers at both polarities stop to propagate when the backward wave of emission reaches the HV electrode. At the same time the cw spectrum appears in optical emission. It can also be seen from the x \u2212 t diagrams that the separation of a feather\u2013like structure and backward wave of emission appears earlier at negative polarity (t = 3\u2212 4 ns) than at positive polarity (t = 6\u2212 7 ns)."

            "text": "The present paper is limited to observations in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the dielectric, but even with this limitation, we can ask the question, at what distance from the electrode is the beginning of the filament, the point at which the transition occurs.\nA complex structure of the contracted channel is confirmed by the 3D diagrams of\nthe emission intensity distribution along the discharge channel taken at U = \u00b125 kV in N2 at 6 bar with the camera gate 1 ns (figure 13). Four time moments were selected differently for negative and positive polarity of discharge according to their different propagation behavior. The color bars in the figure have been unified for both polarities in order to make a better comparison. From figure 13 (a), we can see that at negative polarity the contracted channel appears at t = 4 ns. At t = 5 ns, there is a spot with a high emission intensity near the HV electrode. Starting from this moment, there are two maxima of the emission intensity: one region is close to the HV electrode and the other one is a feather\u2013like structure always observed at the front of the contracted channel. For t = 5 to 7 ns, we can clearly see the increase of emission intensity of the feather\u2013like structure and propagation of the emission further from the HV electrode. At the same time, we observe propagation of a wave of emission from the same point back to the high\u2013voltage electrode.\nIf we consider a fixed point, e.g. 0.8 mm from the HV electrode, the emission\nintensity increases in the period \u2206t = 4 \u2212 7 ns due to the passage of the back wave. When the backward wave of emission approaches the HV electrode (t = 9 ns), the bright spot near the electrode decays. No two separate emission zones are observed any more. Starting from t = 9 ns, the emission intensity along the whole discharge channel increases as the discharge propagates; it is exactly the moment when the streamer\u2013like\nspectra change to the (cw) and atomic lines spectra.\nFor a positive polarity discharge with the same amplitude of the applied voltage,\nfigure 13 (b) shows similar trends as for a negative polarity one. The emission intensity of the spot near the electrode is even higher than the intensity of the feather\u2013like structure. There is a jump between t = 10 and 11 ns which is exactly the moment when the backward wave of emission propagates until the HV electrode. Starting from t = 11 ns, the intensity along the whole discharge channel increases sharply to a high value and stays the same as the discharge propagates.\nThree parameters were monitored in time and in space with the aim of finding\nthe origin of the filament: the FWHM, the amplitude of H\u03b1 line of atomic hydrogen (\u03bb = 656.3 nm), and the amplitude of CN emission. To study H\u03b1 emission, 5% of H2 was added to nitrogen. The total pressure was kept constant and equal to 5 bar.\nPreliminary analysis of time\u2013resolved H\u03b1 spectra integrated on the whole discharge\nregion demonstrated that at t = 5 and 6 ns, no H\u03b1 emission is observed; the SPS of molecular nitrogen dominates in the spectra. Starting from t = 7 ns, the H\u03b1 peak appears and the intensity of emission increases progressively. At t = 9 ns, the H\u03b1 peak is well defined and the second order of SPS system of nitrogen disappears. Combining this information with the discharge images shown in figure 7, one can find that the time interval \u2206t = 7\u2212 10 ns is the interval where the backward wave of emission propagates from the feather\u2013like structure to the high\u2013voltage electrode. The spectra of the discharge taken for the interval \u03bb = 635\u2212675 nm with time delays from t = 7 to 10 ns were analysed for different distances d from the HV electrode. The spatially\u2013resolved spectra accompanied by the micro\u2013images of the discharge channel at t = 7\u2212 10 ns are presented in figure 14 (a). The HV electrode is on the top of each image and the discharge propagates downwards to the ground electrode on the bottom. Each image is divided into 5 regions, marked as region I, II, III, IV and V . From top to bottom, the distance from the HV electrode d is equal to 0\u2212 0.8 mm, 0.8\u2212 1.6 mm, 1.6\u2212 2.4 mm, 2.4\u2212 3.2 mm and 3.2\u2212 4 mm.\nThe very first sign of H\u03b1 emission appears at t = 7 ns in the region II, d =\n0.8\u2212 1.6 mm from the electrode. At t = 8 ns, the H\u03b1 peaks spread in both directions, appearing in region II, III and IV . At t = 9 ns, the H\u03b1 line emission is observed in the whole region. At t = 10 ns, the H\u03b1 line increases in intensity, designating a well\u2013developed filament.\nThe electron density was calculated from the FWHM of H\u03b1 emission as described\nin [21]. The normalized H\u03b1 line emission at t = 8, 9 and 10 ns at different distances from the HV electrode are shown in figure 14 (b). The electron density is the same for all the distances and exhibits a small decay from t = 8 ns to t = 10 ns. High, almost constant electron density, (1\u2212 2) \u00b7 1019 cm\u22123, observed in the region near the electrode (0 < d < 4 mm) in the present work, is in excellent agreement with the electron densities measured before and integrated over the filament, up to 10 mm in length [20,21].\nThe amplitude of H\u03b1 line, assuming that quenching is identical along the plasma\nchannel, indicates relative density of excited hydrogen atoms. CN emission, as described\nabove, is in strong correlation with the cw spectrum but easier to trace and indicates relative intensity of cw emission. Peak emission intensities for H\u03b1 and CN emission as a function of distance from the high\u2013voltage electrode for the time interval \u2206t = 8\u221210 ns\nis presented in figure 15 (a) and figure 15 (b) respectively. As time goes from t = 8 to t = 11 ns, the emission intensity of both H\u03b1 line and CN band increases. The highest emission intensity of H\u03b1 line appears in the region II, 0.8 \u2212 1.6 mm from the HV electrode, while the CN band has the maximum intensity in the region III, at the position 2 mm from the HV electrode. It is important to note that we observe the origin of H\u03b1 and CN emission (and so, a start point of streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition) at a significant 1 \u2212 2 mm distance from the HV electrode. The first stage of transition is the shrinking of a streamer channel and so, increase of the current density. The second stage is the propagation of a feather\u2013like structure from the high\u2013voltage electrode and of a back wave to the high\u2013voltage electrode."

            "text": "A new phenomenon observed in a single\u2013shot high\u2013pressure nSDBD is the appearance, on a front of merged surface streamers, of a plasma zone moving with a higher velocity (see figure 9). A bi\u2013directional ionization wave, one wave moving forward and another backward to the high\u2013voltage electrode, is recorded in the experiment as two waves of optical emission described above. One wave, a feather\u2013like structure, propagates in the direction away from the HV electrode (red curve in figure 12), charging the dielectric surface via a system of surface streamers. Another wave, a backward wave of emission, propagates towards the HV electrode (blue curve in figure 12) along an already charged surface of a thin channel, so a streamer \u201dshell\u201d as a precursor of the propagating wave is not needed. These two waves start from a small (microscopic) region also moving forward from the high\u2013voltage electrode.\nFormally, this phenomenon is similar to the space stem in lightning, an elongated\nplasma zone which forms at the border of the streamer zone of the negative leader, initiates the formation of positive and negative streamers and determines the stepwise mechanism of negative leader propagation [36\u201339]. For this reason we suggest to call this starting point of the two oppositely directed waves, or presumably a microscopic elongated plasma region, a \u201dsurface stem\u201d. There is still insufficient data to claim the identity of the mechanism of space stem and surface stem formation. In particular, the surface stem is formed over nanoseconds, while the space stem [36]\u2014 over tens of microseconds. One of the key questions is how the surface stem is formed in nSDBD. At the moment, this question seems to be the most important in understanding of the filamentation mechanism.\nOne of the possible reasons for the formation of a surface stem is the development\nof the instability of the plane front of the ionization wave, or Laplace instability [40\u201343]. This is an instability of the discharge front to bending disturbances with a characteristic size greater than or of the order of the front thickness [41, 42]. The physical nature of this instability is associated with a local enhancement of the field, in the region of future surface stems at the front of the ionization wave. This leads to an increase in the rate of elongation of these zones and an increase in their electron density, which further\nenhances the field.\nAt the initial stage of evolution (see figures 4, 5 and 9), all nSDBD streamers\nstart synchronously from the edge of the high\u2013voltage electrode. The diameters of the streamers increase with the distance from the electrode, and simultaneously propagating streamers merge into a single front. Starting from this point, the propagation of streamers can be considered as the propagation of an ionization wave with an almost uniform front or as a wave of surface charging. This is true both for the streamers starting from the smooth edge of the disk\u2013shaped high\u2013voltage electrode and for the streamers starting from the teeth of the gear\u2013shaped electrode: at a sub\u2013millimeter scale at 6 bar, the front at 3\u2212 4 ns is already uniform (figures 4\u20135). As a result, the field in the head of each streamer in the front is screened by the neighbors and becomes smaller than the field in the head of a single streamer. Significant and sharp increase of the electric field and the electron density occurs in the parts of the ionization front where the instability develops. In the zone of the enhanced field, new\u2013born surface streamers charge the dielectric surface in front of the propagating discharge channel. This may explain the shape of a feather\u2013like structure (see figures 4, 9 at t = 7\u2212 8 ns for negative polarity and figures 5, 9 at t = 8 \u2212 9 ns for positive polarity). Will remind that at this time period we do not see yet the atomic lines in the spectrum and so the electron density anywhere in space is still much lower than the electron density in the filaments a few nanoseconds later.\nTransverse dimensions of a surface stem are significantly smaller than the diameter\nof the streamer at the point where the surface stem appears. Will suppose that the diameter of a surface stem is close to the diameter of a thin channel connecting the electrode and the feather-like structure. According to figure 11, the diameter of a thin channel is at least 10 times smaller than the diameter of the streamer. As a consequence, one should expect a 100\u2013fold increase in the current density in the surface stem and, accordingly, approximately the same increase in the electron density.\nAs a result of such a \u201ccollapse\u201d of the channel and increase in the ionization\ndegree, there should be a significant redistribution of the potential near the poles of the surface stem and a formation of positive and negative ionization waves (or a bi\u2013 directional ionization wave). These ionization waves propagate in the form of potential gradient waves without noticeable attenuation under the condition that the ionization degree in the channels ahead of the front of these waves Ne/N is low. In nitrogen (no attachment) the decay of electron density will be determined by the rate of electron\u2013ion recombination; at P = 6 atm, the main positive ion will be N+4 with a recombination coefficient \u03b2 = 2\u00b710\u22126 \u00b7(300/Te)0.5 cm3/s [44]. In the field range E/N = 60\u2212100 Td, the electron temperature is approximately Te = 1.5\u2212 2 eV, therefore \u03b2 = 2.4 \u00b7 10\u22127 cm3/s. In this case, \u03c4 \u00b7 Ne = \u03b2\u22121 \u2248 4 \u00b7 106 cm\u22123\u00b7s, that is, at \u03c4 = 2 ns, the electron density is equal to Ne \u2248 2 \u00b7 1015 cm\u22123. Will note that the obtained value is close to the typical electron density in surface streamers: it comprises Ne \u2248 1015 cm\u22123 at atmospheric pressure [45\u201347] and Ne \u2248 1016 cm\u22123 at pressure of 6 bar [31].\nTo ensure the propagation of a fast ionization wave (FIW), it is necessary [48]\nthat the time of formation of the next element of plasma channel after the front of the ionization wave, \u03c4FIW = R/vFIW , be much shorter than the time of polarization of a weakly ionized gas ahead of the FIW front (here R is the radius of the channel, vFIW is the speed of the FIW). Otherwise, a rapid blurring of the front and stopping of the ionization wave will be observed.\nThe polarization time of the channel with length L and radius R is\n\u03c4pol = 1 4\u03c0\u03c3 \u00b7 (L/2R)\n2\nln (L/R) (1)\nwhere \u03c3 is the channel conductivity. In the case where electron\u2013neutral collisions dominate over electron\u2013ion collisions, \u03c3 \u223c Ne/N . At P = 6 atm, L = 2 mm, R = 50 \u00b5m (see figure 11) and an electron density in the channel of Ne = 2 \u00b7 1015 cm\u22123, we obtain a polarization time for such a channel of \u03c4pol \u2248 0.4 ns. Therefore, in order for the front of the potential gradient wave not to \u201cblur\u201d when it moves along the track of streamer channels, the velocity of this wave should be vFIW 107 cm/s, which is consistent with the experimental data, where the recorded velocities are (2\u2212 7) \u00b7 107 cm/s (figure 12).\nWhen the backward wave of emission reaches a zone close to the high\u2013voltage\nelectrode, a high current flows through the thin channels, and the fast gas heating [23] provides a transition to the LTE state with high electron density: the filaments are formed.\nA similar phenomenon, namely the formation of a bi\u2013directional ionization wave,\nwas observed in the recently published work [49], which presents the dynamics of ionization waves in a sinusoidally driven high\u2013voltage (15.43 kHz, 25 kVpp peak\u2013to\u2013peak) surface barrier discharge in atmospheric\u2013pressure air. The authors observed, using sub\u2013 nanosecond\u2013resolved optical emission spectroscopy based on the time\u2013correlated single\u2013 photon counting (TCSPC) technique, a remote streamer initiation on dielectric surface. In the negative half\u2013period, a bi\u2013directional ionization wave formed at the border of the streamer zone, similar to surface stems and bi\u2013directional ionization waves in the present work. The velocities of the ionization waves in [49] were equal to (1\u20132) \u00b7107 cm/s. Upon reaching the HV electrode, the cathode\u2013directed ionization wave formed a cathode spot of increased intensity, which, in turn, initiated formation of a highly conductive plasma channel.\nAn important distinguishing feature of [49] compared to the present work is that it\nwas carried out in a repetitively pulsed SDBD, where an important role should be played by the charge remaining on the dielectric after previous pulses (see review [12]). This complicates the analysis of the results [49]. In addition, in [49] all the main processes occur at microsecond times, that is, at times longer than gas\u2013dynamic rarefaction of channels (for a typical radius of the channel R \u2264 300 \u00b5m). As a consequence, gas heating in the discharge channel should be accompanied by a drop in the particle density, an increase in E/N , and the development of ionization\u2013heating instability [50]. Under the conditions of this work, the characteristic times of the main processes do not exceed 1\u20132 ns, that is much shorter than the characteristic gas\u2013dynamic times for the region\nwhere the surface stem is formed. That is, ionization\u2013heating instability in this region can not explain the origin of the streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition.\nTherefore, the ionization wave propagating towards the HV electrode should reach\nthe edge of the electrode and form a cathode (or anode) spot there. The spots provide a high current flowing through the channel, finalizing a transition from streamer to filament. In the case of discharges of negative polarity, the filamentation mechanism can be due to the field emission [23, 51]. In the case of positive polarity, the filamentation mechanism in the framework of the suggested model is not yet fully understood. In the process of filamentation, the fast gas heating provides, during nanoseconds or even part of a nanosecond, transition to a state close to LTE, with almost complete dissociation of molecules and a very high ionization degree. Reactions of dissociation of nitrogen molecules via electronically excited states of N2 lead to a rapid increase in the dissociation degree. This results in a significant increase in the fraction of atomic N+ ions, which quickly become the dominant type of ions. The coefficients of electron\u2013ion recombination of atomic ions are significantly lower than those of molecular ions [52]. The slowing down of recombination leads to a significant increase in the ionization degree.\nFrom the above, we can conclude that the development of an instability of the plane\nfront of the ionization wave (Laplace instability) and further formation of a surface stem providing a bi\u2013directional ionization wave can be a key element of the filamentation mechanism. It is on the study of this phenomenon that one should, apparently, focus in order to confirm (or refute) this statement.\nIt should also be noted that studies of processes between a streamer channel and\na dielectric play an important role. In a very recent work [53], it was shown that streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition may occur in a very thin layer between the streamer itself and the electron\u2013depleted zone near the dielectric surface. This is possible under conditions of enhanced ionization in this thin layer, including stepwise ionization [54] from high\u2013energy electronically excited states, starting from N2(C 3\u03a0u). In [53], a theory of stepwise ionization of hydrogen\u2013like atoms is transferred to molecular nitrogen. The model explains dependence of streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition in N2:O2 mixtures on oxygen admixtures for the pressure range 2\u221210 atm and voltage amplitudes 25\u221255 kV, and is in good agreement with the experiments [21]. Quenching of excited N2(C 3\u03a0u) molecules by O2 leads to a decrease in the ionization frequency and, accordingly, to an increase in the voltage at which a streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition occurs. However, it should be noted that the model [53] demands an enhanced flux of ionization from highly electronically excited states of N2 \u2014 accordingly, it is assumed [53] that the ionization frequency of N2(C 3\u03a0u) should exceed the frequencies of dissociation and quenching of this state by electron impact. According to TALIF measurements of N\u2013atom density and corresponding kinetic calculations [55], at a specific delivered energy of about a few eV per particle, and electric fields in the mentioned range, E/N = 150 \u2212 300 Td, the electron collisions with N2(A 3\u03a3+u ,B 3\u03a0g,C 3\u03a0u) states result mainly in dissociation of these states. Mentioned contradiction means that the question of the role of stepwise\nionization of N2(C 3\u03a0u) in the thin layer between the streamer and the dielectric surface requires additional experimental (although complicated as far as sub\u2013micron resolution and a side view on the streamer are needed) and theoretical studies."

A formation of thin channels, tens of microns in diameter, is observed inside some of them. The diameter of the considered channels is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the typical diameter of a surface streamer at this point, 200\u2212 600 \u00b5m. A few nanoseconds later, a feather\u2013like structure accumulating surface micro\u2013 streamers, is observed at the front of each thin channel. The feather\u2013like structure propagates forward, from the high\u2013voltage electrode. A backward wave of emission starts from the same point and propagates towards the edge of the high\u2013voltage electrode.\nThe optical emission from a single thin channel is the same in spectral composition\nthan the emission from the streamer. The emission from the feather\u2013like structure is a few times higher in intensity compared to the intensities of emission from the streamer and from the thin channel. During this transition period, which lasts 4-6 nanoseconds, the diameter of the surface stem channel stays small (tens of \u00b5m), resulting in a significant increase in specific delivered energy. High electron density, ne \u223c 1019 cm\u22123, and the continuous wavelength (cw) emission appear along the channel 1-2 ns before the backward wave of emission reaches the edge of the high\u2013voltage electrode. A time resolution of 1 ns is not sufficient to see a point of origin and/or propagation of high electron density and (cw) emission. From this, we conclude that the speed of a new\u2013born filament, when traveling along the surface, should be close to the speed of the FIWs in moderate pressure systems, that is centimeters per nanosecond. In the external zone not \u201cpre\u2013treated\u201d by streamers, the speed of propagation of filaments is limited by the appearance of micro\u2013streamers near the head of the propagating filament and it is lower. Finally, the maximum of H\u03b1 emission (and so the maximum density of excited atoms) is situated at a distance of 1\u2212 1.5 mm from the edge of the electrode.\nProvided theoretical analysis suggests that streamer\u2013to\u2013filament transition can\nstart as a result of the instability of the plane front of the ionization wave, or Laplace instability. The physical nature of this instability is associated with a local enhancement\nof the field at the front of the ionization wave created by merged streamers. As a result, a surface stem should be formed, a specific region with enhanced electron density too small to be observed experimentally under conditions of the present work. The experimental sign of formation of a surface stem is the appearance, from the same point, of two oppositely\u2013directed ionization waves, observed as a feather\u2013like structure and a backward emission. These ionization waves propagate in the form of waves of a gradient of potential without noticeable attenuation under the condition that the ionization degree in the channels ahead of the front of these waves is low.\nWhen the backward wave of emission reaches a zone close to the high\u2013voltage\nelectrode, a high current flows through the thin channels, and the fast gas heating provides a transition to the LTE state with high electron density: the filaments are formed."
