 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. In vitro testing of the ImmunoDefender essential oil mixture against SARS-CoV-2 to validate the in silico findings. This could involve testing the antiviral activity and cytotoxicity of the mixture in cell culture.

2. Animal studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ImmunoDefender as a potential COVID-19 treatment. This could involve SARS-CoV-2 infection models in mice or hamsters. 

3. Clinical trials to determine the efficacy of ImmunoDefender in treating COVID-19 patients. This would involve randomized, placebo-controlled studies in infected individuals.

4. Further computational studies to identify additional natural compounds that could enhance the activity of ImmunoDefender against SARS-CoV-2 variants. 

5. Development of an intranasal formulation of ImmunoDefender to provide local delivery to the respiratory tract for potential prophylactic and therapeutic use. This could improve efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure.
