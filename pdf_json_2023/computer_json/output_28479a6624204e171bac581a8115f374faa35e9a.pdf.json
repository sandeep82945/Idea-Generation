Domination is an extensively studied classic topic in\ngraph theory, to the point that there are several books focused solely on domination, see [8\u201311].\n\u2217Department of Mathematics, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea. ekcho2020@gmail.com \u2020Department of Mathematics, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea. ilkyoo@hufs.ac.kr \u2021Department of Mathematics, Ajou University, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea. khmin1121@ajou.ac.kr \u00a7Department of Mathematics, Ajou University, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea. borampark@ajou.ac.kr\nar X\niv :2\n11 2.\n11 72\n0v 2\n[ m\nat h.\nC O\n] 2\n9 D\nA dominating set of a graph G that is also an independent set in G is an independent dom-\ninating set of G. The independent domination number of G, denoted i(G), is the minimum size\nof an independent dominating set of G. Note that every graph has an independent dominating\nset, as a maximal independent set is equivalent to an independent dominating set. This concept\nappeared in the literature as early as 1962 by Berge [2] and Ore [15]. For a survey regarding\nindependent domination, see [5].\nFor a connected k-regular graph G where k \u2265 1, Rosenfeld [16] showed that i(G) \u2264 |V (G)| 2 , which is tight only for the balanced complete bipartite graph Kk,k. The next natural step is to try to improve the upper bound on the independent domination number when the balanced\ncomplete bipartite graph is excluded. Extending a result by Lam, Shiu, and Sun [13], Cho, Choi,\nand Park [3] recently proved the following result:\nTheorem 1.1 ( [3]). For k \u2265 3, if G is a connected k-regular graph that is not Kk,k, then i(G) \u2264 k\u22121\n2k\u22121 |V (G)|.\nNote that the bound in Theorem 1.1 is tight for k \u2208 {3, 4} by C5 K2 and the 4-regular expansion of a 7-cycle, but the tightness of the bound is unknown for k \u2265 5. See the two left figures of Figure 1 for an illustration. To our knowledge, this is the best upper bound on the\nindependent domination number not only for cubic graphs, but also for regular graphs in general.\nAnother popular way to exclude the complete bipartite graph is to impose restrictions on cycle\nlengths. Recall that the girth of a graph is the length of a smallest cycle in the graph. According\nto [5], the following conjecture was made by Verstrae\u0308te:\nConjecture 1.2 (see [5]). If G is a cubic graph with girth at least 6, then i(G) \u2264 |V (G)| 3 .\nThe girth condition in the conjecture cannot be reduced by the right graph of Figure 1,\nas it has 14 vertices, girth 5, and independent domination number 5. Note that Duckworth\nand Wormald [4] constructed an infinite family of connected cubic graphs with girth 5 whose independent domination number is exactly |V (G)| 3 . For other results regarding the independent domination number of cubic graphs with girth 5, see [7].\nGraphs without odd cycles, namely bipartite graphs, is also an intensively researched class of\ngraphs. Goddard et al. [6] made the following conjecture regarding the independent domination\nnumber of bipartite cubic graphs:\nConjecture 1.3 ( [6]). If G is a connected bipartite cubic graph that is not K3,3, then i(G) \u2264 4 11 |V (G)|.\nIf the above conjecture is true, then it is tight by a graph displayed in [6]. Henning, Lo\u0308wenstein,\nand Rautenbach [12] showed that Conjecture 1.3 is true if a 4-cycle is also forbidden, so the\nconjecture is true for bipartite cubic graphs with girth at least 6. Recently, in 2018, Abrishami\nand Henning [1] improved the aforementioned result by showing that the same conclusion holds\nwhen the bipartite condition (but keeping the restriction on the girth) is removed. The following\nis the result by Abrishami and Henning:\nTheorem 1.4 ( [1]). If G is a cubic graph with girth at least 6, then i(G) \u2264 4 11 |V (G)|.\nOur main result improves Theorem 1.4 in a strong sense. We not only improve the bound from 4 11 to 5 14 , but also enlarge the class of graphs the theorem applies to. Moreover, the new bound is also tight, by the right graph in Figure 1, which has 14 vertices and independent domination\nnumber 5. We now explicitly state our main result:\nTheorem 1.5. If G is a cubic graph without 4-cycles, then i(G) \u2264 5 14 |V (G)|.\nRecall that both K3,3 and C5 K2 must be excluded, which is done by the restriction on the 4-cycle. Moreover, in [6], there are infinitely many connected cubic graphs G satisfying i(G) = 3 8 |V (G)|, which all have 4-cycles.\nWe actually prove a stronger statement, which applies to subcubic graphs. Note that Theo-\nrem 1.5 is a direct consequence of the following theorem:\nTheorem 1.6. If G is a subcubic graph without 4-cycles, then 14i(G) \u2264 14n0(G) + 9n1(G) + 6n2(G) + 5n3(G), where ni(G) denotes the number of vertices of degree i in G.\nThere are infinitely many connected graphs that are tight for the above result. Some simple\nones are the edgeless graph, the 7-cycle, and the right graph in Figure 1. We now construct an\ninfinite family of connected graphs that are tightness examples. For non-negative integers k and ` satisfying k+ ` \u2265 5, let Tk,` be the graph obtained from a (k+ 4`)-cycle x1 . . . xk+4`x1 by adding a pendent vertex to each of x1, . . . , xk, and adding a vertex joining xk+4i+1 and xk+4i+4 for each i \u2208 {0, . . . , `\u2212 1} (see Figure 2). Then n0(Tk,`) = 0, n1(Tk,`) = k, n2(Tk,`) = 3`, n3(Tk,`) = k+ 2`, and i(Tk,`) = k + 2`. Hence, equality in Theorem 1.6 holds.\nDisproving a conjecture by Henning and Southey [17], O and West [14] constructed an infinite\nfamily of 2-connected cubic graphs G satisfying i(G) \u03b3(G) = 5 4 . They asked if this is best possible.\nQuestion 1.7 ( [14]). Does i(G) \u03b3(G) \u2264 5 4 hold for a connected cubic graph G on sufficiently many vertices?\nWe answer this question in the affirmative for cubic graphs without 4-cycles.\nTheorem 1.8. If G is a cubic graph without 4-cycles, then i(G) \u03b3(G) \u2264 5 4 .\nAs all 2-connected cubic graphs G satisfying i(G) \u03b3(G) = 5 4 provided in [14] have a 4-cycle, we raise\nthe following question:\nQuestion 1.9. Is there a cubic graph G without 4-cycles satisfying i(G) \u03b3(G) = 5 4 ?\nWe prove Theorem 1.6 and Theorem 1.8 in Section 2 and Section 3, respectively. We end this\nsection with some definitions frequently used.\nGiven a graph G and X \u2286 V (G), let G[X] denote the subgraph of G induced by X, and let G\u2212X denote the subgraph of G induced by V (G) \\X. For X \u2286 V (G), let \u2202G(X) be the set of edges whose one end is in X and the other end is in G \u2212 X. For a vertex v \u2208 V (G), let dG(v) denote the degree of v in G. For a non-negative integer k, a vertex v is a k-vertex if dG(v) = k, and a k-neighbor of v is a neighbor of v that is also a k-vertex. A 2-step neighbor of v is a vertex\nthat can reach v by a path of length 2. A 2-step k-neighbor of v is a 2-step neighbor that is a\nk-vertex. For a non-negative integer k, let nk(G) denote the number of k-vertices of G. For each vertex v \u2208 V (G), let NG(v) denote the set of neighbors of v, and let NG[v] = NG(v) \u222a {v}. For X \u2286 V (G), let NG(X) = \u22c3 v\u2208X NG(v) and NG[X] = NG(X) \u222aX. For v \u2208 V (G) and X \u2286 V (G), an X-vertex is a vertex in X, and an X-neighbor of v is a neighbor of v that is in X. Throughout\nthe paper, if it is clear which graph we are referring to, then we will simply use d(v), N(v),\nN [v], N [X], and \u2202(X), instead of dG(v), NG(v), NG[v], NG[X], and \u2202G(X), respectively. For {v1, . . . , vk} \u2286 V (G), we simply write N [v1, . . . , vk] instead of N [{v1, . . . , vk}]."

That is,\nw(G) = w(V (G)) = \u2211\nv\u2208V (G) wG(v) = 14n0(G) + 9n1(G) + 6n2(G) + 5n3(G).\nFor a non-empty subset X of V (G), we denote the sum of weight changes of the vertices in G\u2212X by cG(X). That is,\ncG(X) = \u2211\nv\u2208V (G\u2212X) (wG\u2212X(v)\u2212 wG(v)) = w(G\u2212X)\u2212 (w(G)\u2212 wG(X)).\nTo show Theorem 1.6, suppose to the contrary that there exists a counterexample, and let G\nbe a counterexample with the minimum number of vertices and edges. This implies that G is a\nsubcubic graph without 4-cycles satisfying 14i(G) > w(G), and every proper subgraph H of G satisfies 14i(H) \u2264 w(H). If G is the disjoint union of two graphs G1 and G2, then by the minimality of G,\n14i(G) = 14i(G1) + 14i(G2) \u2264 w(G1) + w(G2) = w(G),\nwhich is a contradiction. Thus, G is connected. One can check that the theorem holds for all\ngraphs with at most four vertices, and all paths and cycles on at least five vertices. Thus, G is a\ngraph on at least five vertices and has a 3-vertex.\nWe will often use the following observation. For a vertex v, a vertex of G \u2212 N [v] cannot be adjacent to two vertices in N [v] since G has no 4-cycles. By the same reason, two vertices\ncannot have two common neighbors. We now prove a key lemma that will be crucial in our future\narguments.\nKey Lemma. If S is an independent set of G, then 14|S| > wG(N [S])\u2212 cG(N [S]).\nProof. Let U = N [S], and let S \u2032 be a minimum independent dominating set of G \u2212 U . By the minimality of G, we have w(G\u2212U) \u2265 14i(G\u2212U) = 14|S \u2032|. Since S is an independent dominating set of G[U ] and S \u222aS \u2032 is an independent set, S \u222aS \u2032 is an independent dominating set of G. Since\n14|S|+ 14|S \u2032| \u2265 14i(G) > w(G) = w(G\u2212 U) + wG(U)\u2212 cG(U) \u2265 14|S \u2032|+ wG(U)\u2212 cG(U),\nwe obtain the desired conclusion.\nOur first goal is to prove that G has no 1-vetices. We first lay out some structural observations.\nClaim 2.1. The following do not appear in the graph G:\n(i) A vertex with two 1-neighbors.\n(ii) A vertex with only 2\u2212-neighbors.\n(iii) A 3-vertex with a 1-neighbor and a 2-neighbor.\n(iv) A triangle vuwv such that v has a 1-neighbor.\n(v) A triangle with a 2-vertex.\n(vi) A path vuw such that v, u, w are 3-vertices, v has a 1-neighbor and u has no 1-neighbor.\nProof. In the following, let v be a vertex, and let ti be the number of i-neighbors of v, so t1 + t2 + t3 = d(v). Let U = N [v], so wG(U) = 9t1 + 6t2 + 5t3 + wG(v).\n(i): Suppose to the contrary that t1 \u2265 2. Then wG(U) \u2265 9 \u00b7 2 + min{6, 5 + 5, 5 + 6} = 24 and |\u2202(U)| \u2264 2. If G\u2212U has two isolated vertices, then G is a tree on 6 vertices, so 14i(G) = 14 \u00b7 3 = 42 \u2264 46 = 9 \u00b7 4 + 5 \u00b7 2 = w(G), which is a contradiction. Thus G \u2212 U has at most one isolated vertex, so cG(U) \u2264 5 + 3 = 8. By the Key Lemma, 14 > 24\u2212 8, which is a contradiction. Hence (i) holds.\nActually, by the same logic, we know that cG(U) \u2264 5t2 + (5 + 3)t3 = 5t2 + 8t3. Note that every 3-neighbor of v has at most one 1-neighbor by (i). By the Key Lemma,\n14 > 9t1 + 6t2 + 5t3 + wG(v)\u2212 (5t2 + 8t3) = 9t1 + t2 \u2212 3t3 + wG(v).\n(ii): Suppose to the contrary that t3 = 0, and assume v is such a vertex with minimum degree. If t1 \u2265 1, then by the Key Lemma, 14 > 9t1 + t2 + wG(v) \u2265 9 + 5, which is a contradiction, so t1 = 0. Therefore, all neighbors of v are 2-vertices.\nSuppose that v is a 1-vertex, and let u be the neighbor of v. Since G is a graph on at least 5 vertices, the neighbor w of u that is not v must be a 2+-vertex. Since wG(U) = 9 + 6 = 15, and cG(U) \u2208 {1, 3}, the Key Lemma implies cG(U) = 3, so w must be a 2-vertex. Now, we know\nwG(N [u]) = 9 + 6 \u00b7 2 = 21 and cG(N [u]) \u2264 5. The Key Lemma implies 14 > 21 \u2212 5, which is a contradiction. In particular, there is no 1-vertex with a 2\u2212-neighbor.\nNow suppose that d(v) \u2265 2. Since there is no 1-vertex with a 2\u2212-neighbor, the 2-step neighbors of v are 2+-vertices.\nIf v is a 2-vertex, then wG(U) = 6 \u00b7 3 = 18. Since G is not a cycle, we can take v to be a vertex such that at least one 2-step neighbor of v is a 3-vertex. Since G has no 4-cycle, cG(U) \u2264 3 + 1 = 4, so the Key Lemma implies 14 > 18 \u2212 4, which is a contradiction. If v is a 3-vertex, then wG(U) = 6 \u00b7 3 + 5 = 23 and cG(U) \u2264 3 \u00b7 3 = 9, so the Key Lemma implies 14 > 23\u2212 9, which is a contradiction. Hence (ii) holds.\n(iii): Suppose to the contrary that v is a 3-vertex, t1 \u2265 1, and t2 \u2265 1. Then t1 = t2 = t3 = 1 by (ii), and therefore wG(U) = 9 + 6 + 5 \u00b7 2 = 25. By (ii), the 2-neighbor of v has no 1-neighbor and by (i), the 3-neighbor of v has at most one 1-neighbor, so cG(U) \u2264 5 + 3 \u00b7 2 = 11. The Key Lemma implies 14 > 25\u2212 11, which is a contradiction. Hence (iii) holds.\n(iv): Suppose to the contrary that there is a triangle vuwv such that v has a 1-neighbor. Then wG(U) \u2265 9 + 5 \u00b7 3 = 24 and cG(U) \u2264 5 \u00b7 2 = 10. The Key Lemma implies 14 > 24\u2212 10, which is a contradiction. Hence (iv) holds.\n(v): Suppose to the contrary that there is a triangle vuwv such that v is a 2-vertex. If u is\na 2-vertex, then w must be a 3-vertex since G is a graph on at least 5 vertices. By (ii) and (iv), the neighbor of w not on vuwv must be a 3-vertex, so wG(U) \u2265 6 \u00b7 2 + 5 = 17 and cG(U) \u2264 1. The Key Lemma implies 14 > 17 \u2212 1, which is a contradiction. Thus, u is a 3-vertex, and by symmetry, w is also a 3-vertex, so wG(U) = 6 + 5 \u00b7 2 = 16. Let u\u2032, w\u2032 be the neighbor of u,w, respectively, that is not on the triangle vuwv. Note that u\u2032 6= w\u2032 since G has no 4-cycles. By (iv), both u\u2032 and w\u2032 are 2+-vertices. If u\u2032, w\u2032 are 3-vertices, then cG(U) \u2264 1 \u00b7 2 = 2, so the Key Lemma implies 14 > 16 \u2212 2, which is a contradiction. Without loss of generality, let u\u2032 be a 2-vertex. Note that u\u2032 has no 1-neighbor by (ii). Now, wG(N [u]) \u2265 6 \u00b72+5 \u00b72 = 22 and cG(N [u]) \u2264 3 \u00b72 = 6. The Key Lemma implies 14 > 22\u2212 6, which is a contradiction. Hence (v) holds.\n(vi): Suppose to the contrary that there is a path vuw such that v, u, w are 3-vertices, v has\na 1-neighbor, and u has no 1-neighbor. By (i) and (iii), v has a 3-neighbor x other than u. Note that x 6= w by (iv). By (iii), cG(U) \u2264 1+3+max{5+1, 3+3} = 10. Since wG(U) \u2265 9+5 \u00b73 = 24, the Key Lemma implies 14 > 24\u2212 10, which is a contradiction. Hence (vi) holds.\nClaim 2.2. The graph G has no 1-vertex.\nProof. Suppose to the contrary that G has a 1-vertex. Let X be the set of 3-vertices with 1-\nneighbors. Note that G[X] has maximum degree at most 2 and X is not empty since every\n1-vertex is adjacent to a 3-vertex by Claim 2.1 (ii). Take a component P of G[X]. If P is a cycle, then G is isomorphic to Tk,0 for some k \u2265 3 (see Figure 2), which is a contradiction to our assumption that 14i(G) > w(G). Thus P is a path, and let u1 be an end vertex of P . Let\nN(u1) = {v1, u2, x}, where v1 is the 1-neighbor of u1 and x 6\u2208 X. By Claim 2.1 (i), (iii), and (iv), x and u2 are 3-vertices and xu2 6\u2208 E(G). Let N(x) = {u1, x1, x2}. We know x1 and x2 are 2-vertices by Claim 2.1 (vi).\n(Case 1) Suppose that u2 is on P . Let N(u2) = {v2, y, u1}, where v2 is the 1-neighbor of u2. By Claim 2.1 (i), (iii), and (iv), y is a 3-vertex distinct from x. Let N(y) = {u2, y1, y2}. Note that xy /\u2208 E(G) since G has no 4-cycles. See the first figure of Figure 3 for an illustration. Suppose that u1 is not on a 6-cycle. Consider G\n\u2032 = (G \u2212 {u1, u2, v1, v2}) + xy. Since G\u2032 is a subcubic graph without 4-cycles, by the minimality of G, 14i(G\u2032) \u2264 w(G\u2032). We can always add two vertices in {u1, u2, v1, v2} to a minimum independent dominating set of G\u2032 to obtain an independent dominating set of G, so i(G) \u2264 i(G\u2032) + 2. Since w(G) = w(G\u2032) + 28, we obtain 14i(G) \u2264 14i(G\u2032) + 28 \u2264 w(G\u2032) + 28 = w(G), which is a contradiction. Thus u1 must be on a 6-cycle, say xu1u2yy1x1x.\nSuppose y \u2208 X, and assume y2 is a 1-neighbor of y. Then, y1 is a 3-vertex by Claim 2.1 (i) and (iii). Since x1 is a 2-neighbor of y1, Claim 2.1 (iii) implies y1 /\u2208 X. Now, wG(N [x, v1, v2, y]) = 9 \u00b7 3 + 6 \u00b7 2 + 5 \u00b7 5 = 64 and cG(N [x, v1, v2, y]) \u2264 max{3 + 3, 8} = 8, so the Key Lemma implies 56 = 4\u00b714 > 64\u22128 = 56, which is a contradiction. Thus y /\u2208 X. By Claim 2.1 (vi), y1 and y2 are 2- vertices. Now, wG(N [x1, v1, u2]) = 9\u00b72+6\u00b72+5\u00b74 = 50 and cG(N [x1, v1, u2]) \u2264 max{3+3, 8} = 8, so the Key Lemma implies 42 = 3 \u00b7 14 > 50\u2212 8 = 42, which is a contradiction. (Case 2) Suppose that u2 is not on P . Let N(u2) = {u1, y1, y2}. By Claim 2.1 (vi), y1 and y2 are 2-vertices. For i \u2208 {1, 2}, let x\u2032i and y\u2032i be the neighbor of xi and yi distinct from x and u2, respectively. See the second figure of Figure 3 for an illustration. Since G has no 4-cycles, x\u20321, x \u2032 2, u2 are all distinct. If x \u2032 1 and x \u2032 2 are 3-vertices, then wG(N [x, v1]) = 9 + 6 \u00b7 2 + 5 \u00b7 2 = 31 and cG(N [x, v1]) \u2264 1 \u00b7 3 = 3, so the Key Lemma implies 28 = 2 \u00b7 14 > 31 \u2212 3 = 28, which is a contradiction. Without loss of generality, we may assume x\u20321 is a 2-vertex. By symmetry, we may assume y\u20321 is a 2-vertex. (Case 2-1) Suppose that x\u20321x \u2032 2 \u2208 E(G) and y\u20321y\u20322 \u2208 E(G). Note that x, u1, u2 cannot all be on\nthe same 5-cycle. Thus G\u2032 = (G \u2212 {u1, v1}) + xu2 has no 4-cycles. By the minimality of G, 14i(G\u2032) \u2264 w(G\u2032). Let S \u2032 be a minimum independent dominating set of G\u2032. We will define an independent dominating set S of G of size |S \u2032| + 1. If S \u2032 does not contain a vertex in {x, u2}, then let S = S \u2032 \u222a {v1}. If x \u2208 S \u2032, then exactly one of x\u20321, x\u20322 is in S \u2032, so when x\u20321 \u2208 S \u2032 (resp. x\u20322 \u2208 S \u2032), let S = (S \u2032 \u222a {x2, u1}) \\ {x} (resp. S = (S \u2032 \u222a {x1, u1}) \\ {x}). By symmetry, the case when u2 \u2208 S is also resolved. In every case, i(G) \u2264 i(G\u2032) + 1. Since w(G) = w(G\u2032) + 14, we have 14i(G) \u2264 14i(G\u2032) + 14 \u2264 w(G\u2032) + 14 = w(G), which is a contradiction. (Case 2-2) Without loss of generality, suppose that x\u20321x \u2032 2 6\u2208 E(G). Let x\u2032\u20321 be the neighbor of x\u20321 distinct from x1. By Claim 2.1 (v), we know x \u2032\u2032 1 6= x. By Claim 2.1 (ii), x\u2032\u20321 is a 3-vertex with a 3-neighbor. If x\u2032\u20321 = u2, then wG(N [u1, x \u2032 1]) = 9 + 6 \u00b7 2 + 5 \u00b7 3 = 36 and cG(N [u1, x\u20321]) \u2264 3 \u00b7 2 = 6, so the Key Lemma implies 28 = 2 \u00b7 14 > 36 \u2212 6 = 30, which is a contradiction. Thus x\u2032\u20321 6= u2, and wG(N [u1, x \u2032 1]) = 9 + 6 \u00b7 2 + 5 \u00b7 4 = 41. If G \u2212 N [u1, x\u20321] has no isolated vertices, then cG(N [u1, x \u2032 1]) \u2264 3 \u00b7 4 + 1 = 13, so the Key Lemma implies 28 = 2 \u00b7 14 > 41 \u2212 13 = 28, which is a contradiction. Thus, G \u2212N [u1, x\u20321] must have an isolated vertex. Since y\u20321 is a 2-vertex and x\u20321x\n\u2032 2 6\u2208 E(G), we know x\u2032\u20321y2 \u2208 E(G). Let z be the neighbor of x\u2032\u20321 distinct from x \u2032 1 and y2, so z is a 3-vertex. Let y \u2032\u2032 1 be the neighbor of y\u20321 other than y1, so by Claim 2.1 (ii), y \u2032\u2032 1 is a 3-vertex. See the third figure of Figure 3 for an illustration. Since wG(N [x \u2032\u2032 1]) = 6 \u00b7 2 + 5 \u00b7 2 = 22, the Key Lemma implies cG(N [x\u2032\u20321]) \u2265 9. Thus, together with Claim 2.1 (i) and (iii), we know that the neighbors of z other than x\u2032\u20321 are either both 2-vertices or a 1-vertex and a 3-vertex. Since wG(N [x \u2032\u2032 1, y1]) = 6 \u00b7 4 + 5 \u00b7 3 = 39, by the Key Lemma, 28 = 2 \u00b7 14 > 39 \u2212 cG(N [x\u2032\u20321, y1]), so cG(N [x\u2032\u20321, y1]) \u2265 12. If z = y\u2032\u20321 or zy\u2032\u20321 6\u2208 E(G), then cG(N [x \u2032\u2032 1, y1]) \u2264 3+1 \u00b72+max{3+3, 1+5} = 11, which is a contradiction. Thus zy\u2032\u20321 \u2208 E(G), and moreover, z has a 1-neighbor. See the last figure of Figure 3 for an illustration.\nNow wG(N [u1, x1, y2, y \u2032 1, z]) = 9 \u00b7 2 + 6 \u00b7 5 + 5 \u00b7 6 = 78. Note that y\u2032\u20321 has no 1-neighbor by Claim 2.1 (iii). So cG(N [u1, x1, y2, y \u2032 1, z]) \u2264 max{3 + 3, 8} = 8. By the Key Lemma, 70 = 5 \u00b7 14 > 78\u2212 8, which is a contradiction.\nWe will now analyze the structure between 2-vertices and 3-vertices. In the following, let Ai be the set of 3-vertices with exactly i 2-neighbors, and let Bi be the set of 2-vertices with exactly i 2-neighbors. By Claim 2.1 (ii), A3 = B2 = \u2205, so V (G) can be partitioned into A0, A1, A2, B0, and B1. Note that B0 is an independent set in G and G[B1] is the disjoint union of K2.\nClaim 2.3. The following holds in the graph G:\n(i) Each B1-vertex v has at least one 2-step 2-neighbor. In particular, v has a B1-neighbor and\nan A2-neighbor.\n(ii) Each Ai-vertex v has at least i+ 1 2-step 2-neighbors.\n(ii)-1 If i = 2, then the three neighbors of v are in A2, B1, B1, or A1, B1, B1, or A2, B0, B1.\n(ii)-2 If i = 0, then v has an A1-neighbor, which has an A2-neighbor.\nProof. (i): Let v \u2208 B1, so v has a 2-neighbor v1 and a 3-neighbor v2. If v has no 2-step 2- neighbors, then wG(N [v]) = 6 \u00b7 2 + 5 = 17 and cG(N [v]) \u2264 1 \u00b7 3 = 3, so the Key Lemma implies 14 > 17 \u2212 3, which is a contradiction. By Claim 2.1 (ii), v1 \u2208 B1. Since v must have a 2-step 2-neighbor and v2 cannot have only 2-neighbors by Claim 2.1 (ii), we know v2 \u2208 A2.\n(ii): Suppose to the contrary that a vertex v \u2208 Ai has at most i 2-step 2-neighbors. Then wG(N [v]) = 6 \u00b7 i+ 5 \u00b7 (4\u2212 i) = i+ 20 and cG(N [v]) \u2264 3 \u00b7 i+ 1 \u00b7 ((3\u2212 i) \u00b72) = i+ 6. The Key Lemma implies 14 > (i+ 20)\u2212 (i+ 6) = 14, which is a contradiction.\nIf i = 2, then the three neighbors of v are in A2, B1, B1, or A1, B1, B1, or A2, B0, B1. If i = 0, then v is an A0-vertex. Since an A2-vertex cannot have an A0-neighbor, v has no A2-neighbors. Since v must have a 2-step 2-neighbor w, the common neighbor u of w and v must be an A1-vertex. Since a B1-vertex cannot have an A1-neighbor by (i), w must be a B0-vertex. Since u must have two 2-step 2-neighbors, the 3-neighbor of u distinct from v is an A2-vertex.\nClaim 2.4. The following holds in the graph G:\n(i) The set A2 is not empty.\n(ii) There is a cycle C : x1x2 . . . xkx1 in G[A2 \u222a B1] such that if xi, xi+1 \u2208 A2, then xi has a B0-neighbor. In particular, each A2-vertex on C has at most one A2-neighbor on C and\neach B1-vertex on C has exactly one B1-neighbor on C.\n(iii) If two A2-vertices x, y have a common B0-neighbor v, then there is a 5-cycle vxx1y1yv such\nthat x1, y1 are B1-vertices.\nProof. (i): Suppose to the contrary that G has no A2-vertex. Claim 2.3 implies that there are neither B1-vertices nor A0-vertices. Thus, every 3-vertex has a 2-neighbor, so the set of 2-vertices is a dominating set. Since every 2-vertex is a B0-vertex, B0 dominates G. Moreover, B0 is an independent dominating set in G by definition, so i(G) \u2264 n2(G). Also, n3(G) = 2n2(G) since there are no A2-vertices. Thus, w(G) = 6n2(G) + 5n3(G) = 16n2(G) \u2265 16i(G) > 14i(G), which is a contradiction. Hence, G must have some A2-vertices.\n(ii): Note that there exists an A2-vertex v1 by (i). We find a cycle C : x1x2 . . . x1 of G[A2\u222aB1] containing v1 by the following algorithm: Let x1 = v1. Consider an A2-vertex xi on C. (The indices of the vertices on C are considered modulo k.) If xi has an B1-neighbor u1 that is not xi\u22121, then there is a path u1u2u3 where u1, u2 are B1-vertices and u3 is an A2-vertex by Claim 2.3 (i) and (ii). Let xi+1 = u1, xi+2 = u2, and xi+3 = u3. (Note that xixi+1xi+2xi+3 is indeed a path since xi 6= xi+3 by Claim 2.1 (v).) If the only B1-neighbor of xi is xi\u22121, then let xi+1 be the A2-neighbor of xi, which exists by Claim 2.3 (ii).\nSince G is a finite graph, this algorithm must terminate. Note that each A2-vertex xi with xi+1 \u2208 A2 must have an B0-neighbor by Claim 2.3 (ii). In particular, by the algorithm, each A2-vertex on C has at most one A2-neighbor on C and each B1-vertex on C has exactly one B1-neighbor on C.\n(iii): By Claim 2.3 (ii), x and y have a B1-neighbor x1 and y1, respectively. Suppose to the contrary that x1y1 is not an edge. By Claim 2.3 (i), x1 has a 2-neighbor, so wG(N [x1, y]) = 6 \u00b7 4 + 5 \u00b7 3 = 39. By Claim 2.1 (ii), every 2-step neighbor of x1 not in N [x1, y] is a 3-vertex. By Claim 2.3 (ii), every 2-step neighbor of y not in N [x1, y] is a 2-vertex. Thus, cG(N [x1, y]) \u2264 3 \u00b7 3 + 1 \u00b7 2 = 11, so the Key Lemma implies 28 = 14 \u00b7 2 > 39\u2212 11 = 28, which is a contradiction. Hence, x1y1 \u2208 E(G), so vxx1y1yv is a 5-cycle.\nBy Claim 2.4 (ii), there is a cycle C : x1x2 . . . xkx1 in G[A2 \u222a B1] such that if xi, xi+1 \u2208 A2, then xi has a B0-neighbor. (The indices of the vertices on C will always be considered modulo k.) Define the following subset of V (C):\nX = {xi \u2208 B1 | xi\u22121 \u2208 A2, xi+1 \u2208 B1}.\nLet yi be the B0-neighbor of xi when xi, xi+1 \u2208 A2, and let Y be the set of all yi\u2019s. Note that X \u222a Y consists of 2-vertices, and X \u222a Y is an independent set in G by definition. Let Yj be the set of Y -vertices with exactly j A2-neighbors. If yi is a Y2-vertex, then yixixi\u22121xi\u22122xi\u22123yi is a 5-cycle by Claim 2.4 (iii). Thus, both neighbors of a Y2-vertex are (A2 \u2229 V (C))-vertices, and one of them has an X-neighbor. See Figure 4 for an illustration.\nDefine the following two sets:\nX\u2217 = {xi\u22121 | xi \u2208 X} \\N(Y ), Y \u2217 = {zi | zi is the A1-neighbor of yi distinct from xi}.\nNote that zi is an A1-vertex and is not on C, and |X\u2217| = |X| \u2212 |Y2| and |Y \u2217| = |Y1|,\nClaim 2.5. If X\u2217-vertices xi, xj have a common neighbor v 6\u2208 V (C), then v is a 3-vertex.\nProof. Suppose to the contrary that v is a 2-vertex. Since xi, xj are A2-vertices, we know v \u2208 B0. By Claim 2.4 (iii), there is a 5-cycle xixi+1xi+2xjvxi, where xi+1, xi+2 are B1-vertices, so j = i+3. Since xi+3 is an X \u2217-vertex, we obtain that xi+4 is a B1-vertex, which is a contradiction since now xi+3 has three 2-neighbors xi+2, xi+4, and v.\nClaim 2.6. Two Y \u2217-vertices do not have a common neighbor.\nProof. Suppose to the contrary that two distinct Y \u2217-vertices zi and zj have a common neighbor v. Since each Y \u2217-vertex is an A1-vertex, v must be a 3-vertex. Note that xi\u22121, xi\u22122 \u2208 B1 and xi+1 \u2208 A2, which further implies xi+1 is a 2-vertex in G\u2212N [xi\u22121, zi].\nSuppose v \u2208 A0. Then wG(N [xi\u22121, zi]) = 6 \u00b7 3 + 5 \u00b7 4 = 38, and the neighbor of zi distinct from v and yi is an A2-vertex by Claim 2.3 (ii)-2. Thus if there is a common 2-step neighbor of xi\u22121 and zi, then v is adjacent to either xi\u22123 or xi+1, which is impossible since v \u2208 A0 and xi\u22123, xi+1 \u2208 A2. Thus cG(N [xi\u22121, zi]) \u2264 3 \u00b7 2 + 1 \u00b7 4 = 10, so the Key Lemma implies 28 > 38\u2212 10, which is a contradiction. Thus v \u2208 A1, so v has a B0-neighbor by Claim 2.3 (i).\nLet U1 = N [v, xi, xj], so wG(U1) = 6 \u00b7 5 + 5 \u00b7 7 = 65. Note that every 2-step neighbor of v not in U1 is a 3-vertex, and every 2-step neighbor of xi or xj not in U1 is a 2-vertex. By Claim 2.5, if xi+1, xj+1 \u2208 X\u2217 have a common neighbor u 6\u2208 V (C), then u is a 3-vertex, which is impossible since xi and xj are the 3-neighbors of xi+1 and xj+1, respectively. Thus, there are at most two vertices in G \u2212 U1 that are incident with two edges of \u2202(U1), namely, xi\u22122 and xj\u22122. If there is at most one vertex in G\u2212U1 that is incident with two edges of \u2202(U1), then cG(U1) \u2264 8 + 3 \u00b7 4 + 1 \u00b7 3 = 23, so the Key Lemma implies 42 > 65 \u2212 23 = 42, which is a contradiction. Thus, it must be that xi\u22122 = xj+2 and xj\u22122 = xi+2, so k = 8.\nWithout loss of generality, let i = 0 and j = 4. In this case, wG(N [x0, x3]) = 6 \u00b7 4 + 5 \u00b7 3 = 39 and cG(N [x0, x3]) \u2264 3 \u00b7 3 + 1 \u00b7 2 = 11, so the Key Lemma implies 28 > 39 \u2212 11, which is a contradiction.\nLet U = N [X \u222a Y ], so |U | = 3|X|+ 3|Y1|+ 2|Y2| and wG(U) = 17|X|+ 16|Y1|+ 11|Y2|. Note that G[U ] contains C as a subgraph and every edge in \u2202(U) is incident with a vertex in X\u2217 \u222a Y \u2217. By the Key Lemma, 14|X|+ 14|Y1|+ 14|Y2| = 14|X \u222a Y | > (17|X|+ 16|Y1|+ 11|Y2|)\u2212 cG(U), so\ncG(U) > 3|X|+ 2|Y1| \u2212 3|Y2|. (2.1)\nDefine the initial charge \u00b5(u) for every vertex u \u2208 X\u2217 \u222a Y \u2217 \u222a (V (G) \\ U) as below:\n\u00b5(u) =  \u22123 if u \u2208 X\u2217, \u22122 if u \u2208 Y \u2217, wG\u2212U(u)\u2212 wG(u) if u \u2208 V (G) \\ U.\nNote that the sum of the initial charge is cG(U)\u2212 3|X\u2217| \u2212 2|Y \u2217| = cG(U)\u2212 3(|X| \u2212 |Y2|)\u2212 2|Y1|, which is positive by (2.1). We distribute the charge by the following rule, so the sum of the total charge is preserved. Recall that every edge in \u2202(U) is incident with a vertex in X\u2217 \u222a Y \u2217. [Rule] Let uv \u2208 \u2202(U) where u \u2208 U . If u \u2208 X\u2217, then u sends \u22123 to v. If u \u2208 Y \u2217, then u sends \u22121 to v.\nLet \u00b5\u2217(u) be the final charge of each vertex u after applying the above rule. We will obtain a contradiction by proving that the final charge of each vertex in X\u2217\u222aY \u2217\u222a(V (G)\\U) is non-positive.\nClaim 2.7. \u00b5\u2217(v) \u2264 0 for a vertex v \u2208 X\u2217 \u222a Y \u2217 \u222a (V (G) \\ U).\nProof. Since an X\u2217-vertex is incident with at most one edge of \u2202(U) and a Y \u2217-vertex is incident with at most two edges of \u2202(U), it is clear from the definitions that \u00b5\u2217(v) \u2264 0 for a vertex v \u2208 X\u2217 \u222a Y \u2217. Suppose to the contrary that there is a vertex v \u2208 V (G) \\ U such that \u00b5\u2217(v) > 0. Clearly, v is incident with a vertex in X\u2217 \u222a Y \u2217. By [Rule], we have\nwG\u2212U(v)\u2212 wG(v) > 3|X\u2217 \u2229N(v)|+ |Y \u2217 \u2229N(v)|. (2.2)\nWe divide the proof into two cases. (Case 1) Suppose that v has no Y \u2217-neighbor, so v must have an X\u2217-neighbor. If |X\u2217\u2229N(v)| = 1, then wG\u2212U(v)\u2212wG(v) \u2264 3 = 3|X\u2217 \u2229N(v)|, which is a contradiction to (2.2). If |X\u2217 \u2229N(v)| = 3, then v is a 3-vertex in G, and wG\u2212U(v)\u2212 wG(v) = 9 = 3|X\u2217 \u2229N(v)|, which is a contradiction to (2.2). Thus |X\u2217 \u2229N(v)| = 2. If v is a 3-vertex, then wG\u2212U(v)\u2212 wG(v) = 4 < 6 = 3|X\u2217 \u2229N(v)|, which is a contradiction to (2.2). Thus, v is a 2-vertex with only X\u2217-neighbors, which is a\ncontradiction to Claim 2.5. (Case 2) Suppose that v has a Y \u2217-neighbor. By the definition of Y \u2217, we see that v is a 3-vertex. By Claim 2.6, v has exactly one Y \u2217-neighbor. If |X\u2217 \u2229 N(v)| = 0, then wG\u2212U(v) \u2212 wG(v) = 1 = 3|X\u2217 \u2229 N(v)| + |Y \u2217 \u2229 N(v)|, which is a contradiction to (2.2). If |X\u2217 \u2229 N(v)| = 1, then wG\u2212U(v) \u2212 wG(v) = 4 = 3|X\u2217 \u2229 N(v)| + |Y \u2217 \u2229 N(v)|, which is a contradiction to (2.2). Thus |X\u2217 \u2229 N(v)| = 2, which implies that v is an A0-vertex, since X\u2217 \u2286 A2 and Y \u2217 \u2286 A1. This is a contradiction since an A0-vertex is not adjacent to an A2-vertex.\nBy Claim 2.7, the final charge of each vertex is non-positive, and we reach a contradiction to\n(2.1). Hence, the counterexample G cannot exist."

            "text": "In this section, we prove Theorem 1.8. Given a graph G and v \u2208 X \u2286 V (G), the X-external private neighborhood of a vertex v is defined by epn(v,X) = {u \u2208 V (G) \\X | NG[u] \u2229X = {v}}.\nA dominating set X of G inducing a graph with maximum degree at most 1 is a near independent\ndominating set.\nLemma 3.1. For a near independent dominating set X of a cubic graph G, i(G) \u2264 |X| + 1 2 n1(G[X]).\nProof. We use induction on n1(G[X]). If n1(G[X]) = 0, then X is an independent dominating set of G, so the statement holds since i(G) \u2264 |X|. Now, assume n1(G[X]) > 0. Take a vertex v \u2208 X with a neighbor in X. Since G is cubic, | epn(v,X)| \u2264 2. Take a maximal independent set I of G such that I \u2286 epn(v,X), and let X \u2032 = (X \u222a I) \\ {v}. (Note that I = \u2205 when epn(v,X) = \u2205.) Then X \u2032 is a near independent dominating set of G such that |X \u2032| \u2264 |X|+ 1 and n1(G[X \u2032]) \u2264 n1(G[X])\u2212 2, so by the inductive hypothesis, we have i(G) \u2264 |X \u2032|+ 1\n2 n1(G[X \u2032]) \u2264 (|X|+1)+ 1 2 (n1(G[X])\u22122) = |X|+ 12n1(G[X]).\nProof of Theorem 1.8. Let G be a cubic graph without 4-cycles, and let D be a minimum dominating set of G with the minimum number of edges in G[D]. Suppose that a vertex v \u2208 D has two neighbors in D. By the minimality of |D|, we have | epn(v,D)| = 1. Then D\u2032 = (D\u222a epn(v,D))\\{v} is a dominating set of G. Note that |D\u2032| = |D| and |E(G[D\u2032])| < |E(G[D])|, which is a contradiction to the choice of D. Thus, every vertex in D has at most one neighbor in\nD, so D is a near independent dominating set of G.\nLet mi = ni(G[D]). Then\n\u03b3(G) = |D| = m0 +m1. (3.1)\nIf m0 \u2265 m1, then (3.1) implies \u03b3(G) \u2265 2m1, so together with Lemma 3.1, we have the desired inequality since\ni(G) \u2264 |D|+ 1 2 m1 \u2264 \u03b3(G) + 1 4 \u03b3(G) = 5 4 \u03b3(G).\nIf m0 \u2264 m1, then (3.1) implies \u03b3(G) \u2265 2m0, so by Theorem 1.5, it holds that\ni(G) \u2264 5 14 |V (G)| \u2264 5 14 (4m0 + 3m1) = 5 14 (3\u03b3(G) +m0) \u2264 5 14\n( 3\u03b3(G) + 1\n2 \u03b3(G)\n) = 5\n4 \u03b3(G),\nwhere the second inequality is from the fact that D is a dominating set of a cubic graph, and the\nthird equality is from (3.1)."
