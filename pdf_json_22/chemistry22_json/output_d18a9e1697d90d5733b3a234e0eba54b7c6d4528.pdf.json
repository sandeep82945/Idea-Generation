    "abstractText": "The interaction between polyphenols and polysaccharides plays an important role in increasing the turbidity stability of fruit juice and improving unpleasant sensory experiences. The binding adsorption behavior between hawthorn pectin (HP) and polyphenols (epicatechin and chlorogenic acid) accorded with the monolayer adsorption behavior driven by chemical action and were better fitted by pseudo-second order dynamic equation and Langmuir model. The HP binding sites (Qm) and adsorption capacity (Qe) to epicatechin were estimated at 75.188 and 293.627 \u03bcg/mg HP, respectively, which was about nine and twelve times higher than that of chlorogenic acid. The interaction between HP and polyphenols exhibited higher turbidity characteristics, particle size and lower zeta potential than epicatechin and chlorogenic acid alone. Meanwhile, according to Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, it could be speculated that the interaction between HP and polyphenols resulted in chemical combination. Moreover, \u2206H < 0 and T\u2206S < 0, which indicated that the interaction between HP and polyphenols was mainly driven by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces.",

            "text": "Hawthorn, belonging to the Crataegus spp. of Rosaceae family, is a deciduous and fruit-bearing shrub or small tree which is originated and distributed in East Asia, Europe and North America with 260 species [1,2]. As a kind of edible fruit, hawthorn has a long history which might be dated back to more than three thousand years ago recorded in the ancient books Erya in China. Nowadays, besides the fresh-eating, hawthorn would be processed as snacks, drinks and fillings as well as available as dietary supplements in the food market. As a kind of hawthorn processing product, hawthorn juice is favored by consumers due to its high nutritional value which may be associated with its bioactive components, such as high pectin content, polyphenols and other bioactive substances [1,3]. However, the formation of turbidity and unpleasant sensory experiences such as bitterness and astringency were considered a common phenomena in the juice production process and pectin could well improve unpleasant sensory experiences by the interaction between polyphenol [4\u20136]. It should be noted that in different systems, the interaction between pectin and polyphenol was different, and the influence on food systems such as fruit juice was also different. Therefore, exploring the relationship between pectin and polyphenol could provide a theoretical basis for improving the quality of fruit juice. Polyphenols are generally localized in vacuoles of the living plant cells and they would be released in the food processing in which there are various external forces such as heating, drying and high pressure [7,8]. Additionally, multiple food matrix ingredients could also be released and contacted with polyphenols quickly and spontaneously, which\nFoods 2022, 11, 2813. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11182813 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2022, 11, 2813 2 of 18\nwould affect the bioavailability of polyphenols [9,10]. Diez-Sanchez et al. have shown that when polyphenols were incorporated into the model systems (dietary fiber, protein, etc.), the bioaccessibility was increased compared to polyphenols alone [11]. Liu et al. also have shown that dietary fiber and other food matrix could be used as a carrier for polyphenols, which could not only improve the bioavailability of polyphenols, but also transport these antioxidants to the human gut microbiota and further produce beneficial physiological effects after their fermentation in small phenolic compounds [12]. Pectin is an anionic polysaccharide from cell wall and mainly composed of linear chains of galacturonic acid. Depending on the composition, the structure of pectin is categorized into three main structural units, namely homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan-II (RG-II) [13]. Furthermore, as an essential constituent in food, pectin could form complex with polyphenols and the complex systems have received an increasing research attention in order to extend their food applications in recent years. Pectin had the stronger interaction with polyphenols, which might be dependent on their structural characteristics (e.g., molar mass, size, proportion of branching length and degrees of methylation) and was dominated by noncovalent interactions driven by hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds [12,14]. Strong binding was observed between highly galloylated tannin and pectin with high degree of esterification from persimmon, which was controlled by cooperative hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction [15]. Hairy regions of pectin with only monomeric side chains showed higher association with procyanidin and involved hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond [16]. Higher anthocyanins binding ability was attributed to the more linear, more negatively charged homogalacturonan region of chelator-soluble pectin compared to water-soluble pectin, whereas hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction were the main driving forces involved [17]. Furthermore, pectin with different structural compositions showed various binding capacity to polyphenols and this interaction was selective. The binding ability of pectin and proanthocyanidins was in the following order from low to high: arabinans, arabinans + galactans II, galactan I, arabinans + galactan I + xylogalacturonans and rhamnogalacturonan [16]. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated association constants (Ka) of interactions between pectin from citrus peel and persimmon tannin presented range from 2.04 \u00d7 103 to 8.50 \u00d7 103 M\u22121 [15], whereas the strong affinity (Ka = 1.4 \u00d7 104 M\u22121) was between apple pectin and procyanidin [14]. Similar findings were also confirmed in studies of pectin and proanthocyanidins derived from grape and pear [14,18]. Interactions between pectin and polyphenols would affect the quality of products [19,20]. Studies have shown that pectins from different sources have different structures, which would determine the interaction with polyphenols and have different effects on the juice system. The grape pectins could affect the aggregation of tannin and protein, which might improve the astringency during fruit processing and beverages production [6]. Symoneaux et al. have shown that pectin could reduce the astringency of fruit wine produced by the interaction between tannin and protein in the mouth [21]. Apple pectin could compete with protein for the binding of proanthocyanidin monomer catechin in the simulated apple juice system, which prevented the system from forming larger particles and enhanced the stability of the system [22]. Pectin of citrus, apple and beet enhance the stability of anthocyanin in blackcurrant and strawberry, which improved color stability of anthocyanins-containing foods and beverages [23,24]. In precision medicine and other field, pectin was also extensively used to encapsulate procyanidins and controlled release according to its hydrogel and porous characteristics [15,23]. However, there was little information about the interaction mechanism between pectin and polyphenol in hawthorn juice system. Therefore, a deep understanding of the driving molecular mechanisms of the interaction between pectin and polyphenol could lead to a better utilization of the benefits of the active ingredients, which was more conducive to the processing and production of fruit juice. Epicatechin and chlorogenic acid are flavan-3-ol and phenolic acid, respectively. Studies have shown that there were a higher content for epicatechin and chlorogenic acid in\nFoods 2022, 11, 2813 3 of 18\nChinese hawthorn [25,26]. Furthermore, based on our previous studies, the contents of epicatechin and chlorogenic acid were preliminarily determined as 269.3 and 78.6 mg/100 g DW in hawthorn fruit (Big Venus), respectively. Based on above, in the current study, epicatechin and chlorogenic acid were applied in the hawthorn juice simulation system as the representative polyphenols for the study of the interaction between polysaccharides and polyphenols. The objectives of our study are (1) to investigate the adsorption capacity between HP and two polyphenols, and (2) to analyze and study the internal driving mechanism of interaction."

            "text": "The extraction of HP was based on the method described by Guo et al. [27] with a few modifications. After cleaning and removing seeds, fresh hawthorn was cut into 1\u20132 mm thickness and freeze-dried (4 \u25e6C, 20 h). Freeze-dried hawthorn was ground into powder using an electric grinder and sieved with 100-meshes to obtain hawthorn flour. 20 g of hawthorn flours and cellulase (0.6 g) were dissolved in 200 mL distilled water and mixed well. The mixture was then placed into a water bath at 55 \u25e6C and extracted for 5 h under constantly and gently stirring. After extraction twice, a process of centrifugation (2273\u00d7 g, 3 min) was followed and the supernatant was combined and cooled to room temperature as the crude HP. Next, the crude HP was deproteinized with 1/4 volume of Savage reagent (butyl alcohol:chloroform = 1:4) and decolorized using the pretreated D3520 macroporous resin in a 1:10 (g:mL) ratio. Subsequently, the filtrate was rotary evaporated to 1/6 of the initial volume and then three-fold volume of absolute ethanol was added for precipitating the pectin overnight at 4 \u25e6C. The precipitate was obtained by centrifugation (2273\u00d7 g, 3 min) to remove ethanol, and then re-dissolved in distilled water and evaporated at 55 \u25e6C in order to remove the extra ethanol. The purified HP was definitively obtained by freeze-drying (4 \u25e6C, 20 h) and stored in the desiccator for the further analysis.\n2.3. Chemical Composition Analysis 2.3.1. Monosaccharide Determination\nThe monosaccharide composition of HP was determined by the method with a few modifications [28]. Briefly, 1 mg/mL of HP aqueous solution mixed with 1 mL of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 4 M) was hydrolyzed at 110 \u25e6C for 2 h in a 5 mL ampoule bottle. Subsequently, 500 \u00b5L of methanol was added to the polysaccharide hydrolysates and it was dried with a nitrogen blower. The residue was dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water and was mixed with 120 \u00b5L of NaOH solution (0.3 M) and 120 \u00b5L of 1-phenyl-3-methyl2-pyrazolin-5-one (PMP) methanol solution.

Afterwards, the reaction system was neutralized with 120 \u00b5L of HCl solution (0.3 M) and extracted three times with 2 mL of chloroform. Then the aqueous phase was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a UV-Vis detector (Agilent 1260). The analysis was performed at 30 \u25e6C with a Hypersil BDS (Thermo)-C18 (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m) at 250 nm.

Uronic Acid Determination\nUronic acid content was analyzed according to the colorimetric method reported by Kim et al. [29] and applied with a few modifications. 1 mg/mL of HP was mixed with 5 mL of sodium tetraborate in sulphuric acid (12.5 mM) and incubated in a boiling water bath at 100 \u25e6C for 5 min. After incubation, the sample was cooled to room temperature and 200 \u00b5L of 1.5 mg/mL 3-phenylphenol was added to react with the released uronic acids. Afterwards, the mixture was mixed well before the observation by UV-VIS spectrometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan) at 525 nm. Control sample was mixed with equal volume of distilled water and incubated under the same conditions. The total content of uronic acid was calculated based on calibration with galacturonic acid standards (20\u201370 \u00b5g/mL). All measurements were done in triplicate.\n2.3.3. Total Sugar Determination\nTotal sugar content was determined by a phenol sulfuric acid method [6] and applied with a few modifications. HP was dissolved in distilled water (1 mg/mL) and diluted 40 times. Afterwards, 5% phenol in sulfuric acid was sequentially added into 1 mL of the diluted solution. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, absorbance was measured at 490 nm in an UV-VIS spectrometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan). Control sample was mixed with equal volume of distilled water and incubated under the same conditions. The total sugar were measured based on calibration with glucose standards (20\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL). All measurements were done in triplicate.\n2.3.4. Degree of Methyl Esterification Determination\nThe degree of methyl esterification (DE) of HP was determined by following the method of Yu et al. [30] with a few modifications. HP (0.2 g) was placed in an erlenmeyer flask and wetted with 1 mL of ethanol, followed by 20 mL of distilled water was added and incubated at 35 \u25e6C as well as constantly stirring until dissolved completely. The resulting solution was titrated with 0.1 M NaOH in the presence of phenolphthalein until the solution color changed and the volume of the consumed solution was recorded as V1. Then, 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution was added and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Afterwards, 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl was added and titrated with 0.1 M NaOH until the solution color changed. The volume of the consumed solution was recorded as V2. The degree of methyl esterification (DE) of HP was calculated according to the following formula:\nDE (%) = (V2/(V1 + V2) \u00d7 100 (1)\n2.3.5. High Performance Gel Permeation Chromatography\nThe molecular weight of HP was determined by high performance gel permeation chromatography (GPC) coupled with a refractive index detector (RID-20, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). A guard column of TSK (35 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.), and columns of TSKgel G3000PWXL (300 mm \u00d7 7.8 mm i.d.) and TSKgel G4000PWXL (300 mm \u00d7 7.8 mm i.d.) (Tosoh Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were used. HP was dissolved by distilled water (20 mg/mL) and filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter. The injection volume was 20 \u00b5L, and mobile phase was 0.05 M sodium nitrate solution containing 0.5 g/L of sodium azide as preservative. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min at 35 \u25e6C. 1 mg/mL of pullulan polysaccharide (shodex Company, Yokohama, Japan) standard was used as markers [31]."

Afterwards, each sample was preheated to 25 \u25e6C for 30 s in water and tested three times in parallel [15].\n2.6.3.

These models could well reveal the adsorption process of pectin and polyphenols in this experiment and the model fittings and parameters calculation were shown in Figure 1 and Table S3, respectively. Figure 1B showed the straight line plots of Qt vs. t0.5 and described the rate constant of intragranular diffusion (Kp) and the correlation coefficient (R2). The straight line did not cross the origin which indicated that the fitting effect between HP and polyphenols (EC and CA) was not good, and other adsorption\nFoods 2022, 11, 2813 9 of 18\nmechanisms may be accompanied by the interaction between pectin and polyphenols. As shown in Table S3, the correlation coefficients (R2) of EC and CA were 0.016 and 0.705, the rate constant of intragranular diffusion (Kp) were 0.018 and 0.178, respectively. These investigations indicated that the fitting effect was not good. Therefore, the pseudo-first and pseudo-second order adsorption models were adopted to explore other adsorption mechanisms and these fitting results were shown in Figure 1C,D, respectively. In addition, a presence of some negative values located at longer periods of the process were not showed in Figure 1C, which indicated that the pseudo-first order kinetic model did not fit the whole range of contact time was only applicable for the initial stage of the adsorption process [39]. The rate constants obtained from the plot of experimental data and the correlation coefficients of the two kinetic models were also shown in Table S3. As shown in Table S3, the correlation coefficients (R2) of the pseudo-first order model for EC and CA were 0.793 and 0.853, which were relatively lower than the correlation coefficients (R2) of the pseudo-second order model (0.998 and 0.975 for EC and CA, respectively). It was obviously that the pseudo-second order kinetic model was a better fit than the pseudo-first order kinetic model. Moreover, the calculated Qe value (75.188 and 8.873 \u00b5g/mg HP for EC and CA, respectively) was close to the experimental data (76.221 and 7.434 \u00b5g/mg HP for EC and CA, respectively) in the case of pseudo-second order kinetic model. These results indicated that the adsorptive process between HP and polyphenols followed a pseudo-second order kinetic, which was mainly controlled by chemical adsorption, agreed with the adsorption mechanism between chitosan and tannic acid [38].\n3.2.2. Adsorption Isotherm Models Analysis\nAdsorption isotherm models were an important study method to determine the efficiency of the adsorption process. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models have been applied for fitting the experimental data. The model fittings and parameterrs calculation were shown in Figure S1 and Table S4. As shown in Figure S1, the amount of adsorption HP to polyphenols increased non-linearly with the increasing concentration of free polyphenols, whereas adsorption behavior varies may depend on different polyphenol classes. As a result, the number of aromatic moieties and phenolic hydroxyl groups presented in the chemical structure and neutral charge which might explain why HP bounds to EC with a greater extent than CA. Structurally, the representative of flavan-3-ols (EC) had two aromatic rings and four phenolic hydroxyl groups, whereas CA as the representative of phenolic acid had one aromatic ring and two phenolic hydroxyl groups. Previous studies have shown that the number of aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups (e.g., phenolic hydroxyl groups) presented in the molecular structures would contribute to the noncovalent interaction between polyphenols and cellulose, mainly through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding [40,41]. Furthermore, more ortho phenolic hydroxyl groups and aromatic ring made for a greater number of combinations between polysaccharides and polyphenols [14]. In this study, lower adsorption between HP and CA also might be partly due to electrostatic interaction between HP and CA with negative charge. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were applied to predict the maximum apparent binding capacity (Qm) and the apparent binding affinity constant (KL) of different polyphenols, which are shown in Table S4. Both models could provide a good fit to experimental adsorption data (R2 > 0.97). The correlation coefficients (R2) of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm adsorption model were 0.999 and 0.998, respectively, which could be seen that Langmuir isotherm adsorption model was slightly better than Freundlich isotherm adsorption model, agreed with Liu et al. [8]. The results indicated that the adsorption mechanism between HP and polyphenols was closed to the monolayer adsorption process, which was agreed with adsorption isotherm studies on the interaction between apple cell walls and polyphenols [8]. The maximum apparent binding capacity (Qm) could be interpreted as total number of binding sites that were available for adsorption. The Qm of EC was 12 times higher\nFoods 2022, 11, 2813 10 of 18\nthan CA (293.627 \u00b1 6.265 and 23.71 \u00b1 3.440 \u00b5g/mg HP, respectively). The KL of EC and CA was calculated (0.014 \u00b1 0.0006 and 0.009 \u00b1 0.0002, respectively) and did not show the same pattern, indicating that HP had different binding capacities to different polyphenols. Liu et al. have indicated that Qm and KL were used to represent for the binding saturation level and the binding affinity, respectively [8]. In fact, high binding capacities were always consistent with low binding affinities. Interestingly, the Qm of EC was much higher than CA, whereas the affinity of EC and CA was similar. Furthermore, the fitting result is much higher than the actual adsorption capacity, agreed with previous studies [17,41].\n3.2.3. Effect of Solution Conditions on Adsorption Capacity of Different Polyphenols\nFor pH, it had different effects on EC and CA (Figure 2). With the change of pH, the adsorption amount of EC changed, although there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the changing trend of CA with pH was different from that of EC. The adsorption amount decreased significantly only at pH 4 (p < 0.05), and then did not change significantly with the increase or decrease of pH (p > 0.05). Liu et al. recorded that the pKa of pectin and CA were 3.5 and 3.3 respectively [8]. When the pH was 4, both of them were negatively charged, therefore there was electrostatic repulsion. Theoretically, with the further increase of pH, the electrostatic interaction would be strengthened, and the adsorption amount would be further reduced correspondingly. However, our results had no significant change, so it could be inferred that there were other driving forces, and electrostatic interaction was not the main driving force.\nFoods 2022, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 19\nLangmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were applied to predict the maximum apparent binding capacity (Qm) and the apparent binding affinity constant (KL) of different polyphenols, which are shown in Table S4.

However, the adsorption of HP and CA did not change significantly with the increase of temperature (p > 0.05). It could be seen that the interaction between HP and EC was more affected by temperature than CA. Phan et al. indicated that the interaction between polyphenols and polysaccharides would be weakened with the increase of temperature, which might be due to the fact that the temperature changed the stability of polyphenols in solution and the enthalpy of binding [41]. Increasing the temperature may improve the solubility of the polyphenol molecules in the aqueous solution, thereby limiting the combination of polyphenol with other substances. Previous studies showed that the temperature effect might be partly due to the hydrogen bond effect, and it might also be related to Van der Waals force, hydrophobic interaction, and \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugate and other noncovalent interactions [14,42].\nFoods 2022, 11, 2813 11 of 18\nFor ionic concentration, with the increase of ion concentration, the adsorption amount of HP and EC showed a significant difference until it reached 100 mM (p < 0.05), while there was no significant difference when the ionic concentration continually increased (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, the adsorption amount of HP and CA did not change significantly with the increase of ionic concentration (p > 0.05, Figure 2). Previous studies have shown that hydrophobic interaction has been established between hydrophobic regions of cellulose polymers and hydrophobic groups (such as aromatic rings) in the molecular structure of polyphenols. The interaction was enhanced with the increase of ionic strength (p > 0.05), which could be inferred that the influence of ionic concentration on adsorption amount was not dominant [14]. Our research results were consistent with previous researches and indicated hydrophobic interaction was not the main driving force. Based on these results, it could be inferred that pH, temperature and ion concentration had different effects on different polyphenols. Our analysis showed that the interaction between HP and polyphenols might mainly involve hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction, while hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction were not the main internal driving force, the main driving mechanism need to be further studied."

The turbidity of the mixtures of HP and polyphenols rose with increasing HP concentrations, which may be due to the slight haze formation (Figure S2A).

Figure S2B showed the optical density of HP with the different polyphenols concentrations.

The change of surface morphology of HP might be due to the interaction between HP and polyphenols by inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds.
