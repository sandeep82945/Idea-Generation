Exploration of Alternative Metalloporphyrins and Ionic Liquids: Building on the successful use of cobalt porphyrin and BMIÂ·BF4, future studies could explore a wider range of metalloporphyrins (e.g., iron, manganese, or zinc porphyrins) and different ionic liquids with varied anions and cations. This would help to identify more efficient combinations for CO2 electrochemical reduction, focusing on increasing selectivity towards desirable products and further reducing overpotentials.

Design and Synthesis of Novel Ionic Liquids: Given the importance of the ionic liquid's role in facilitating CO2 electrochemical reduction, synthesizing novel ionic liquids with specifically designed properties could enhance CO2 solubility, stability, and electrochemical performance. This includes investigating ionic liquids that could stabilize different intermediates or promote different reaction pathways, enhancing selectivity and efficiency for desired products.

Mechanistic Studies Using Advanced Spectroscopic Techniques: The study highlighted the importance of in-situ SERS in understanding reaction mechanisms. Future research could leverage other advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) or time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, to gain deeper insights into the electronic structure of active sites, intermediate species, and reaction dynamics. These insights could guide the design of more effective catalysts and reaction conditions.

Integration of CO2 Reduction Systems with Renewable Energy Sources: To enhance the sustainability of CO2 electrochemical reduction, research could focus on integrating these systems with renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. This involves the development of electrocatalytic systems that operate efficiently under variable power inputs and optimizing system design for direct coupling with renewable energy sources to minimize energy losses and enhance overall sustainability.

Development of Scale-up Strategies and Reactor Designs: While the study provides valuable insights at the laboratory scale, scaling up these processes poses significant challenges. Future research could focus on developing scalable reactor designs that maintain high efficiency and selectivity of CO2 reduction. This includes the engineering of flow reactors, optimizing electrode configurations, and integrating systems for continuous operation and product separation. Investigating the economic and environmental impacts of scaled-up processes would also be crucial for assessing the viability of this technology for industrial carbon capture and utilization (CCU) applications.
