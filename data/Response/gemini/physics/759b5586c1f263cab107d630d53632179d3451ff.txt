1. **Investigate the potential of using click chemistry to develop novel drug delivery systems for EOs that can specifically target muscle tissue.** This could involve the synthesis of EO-based prodrugs or conjugates that can be selectively delivered to muscle cells, thereby improving the efficacy and reducing the side effects of EO therapy.


2. **Explore the use of EOs in combination with other natural compounds, such as herbal extracts or nutraceuticals, to create synergistic effects for the treatment of DMD.** This could involve studying the interactions between different EOs and other natural compounds, as well as evaluating the efficacy of these combinations in animal models of DMD.


3. **Investigate the potential of using EOs to improve the bioavailability and effectiveness of existing DMD therapies.** This could involve formulating EOs into nanocarriers or other drug delivery systems that can enhance their absorption and distribution in the body, thereby improving their therapeutic effects.


4. **Study the long-term effects of EO therapy on muscle function and mental health in DMD patients.** This could involve conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EO therapy over an extended period of time, as well as assessing the impact of EO therapy on the quality of life of DMD patients.


5. **Investigate the potential of using EOs to prevent or delay the onset of DMD.** This could involve studying the effects of EO therapy in animal models of DMD, as well as conducting clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of EO therapy in preventing or delaying the onset of DMD in at-risk individuals.
