"However, there were no significant variations in the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) or nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) across treatments." 

"Hardly any investigations have studied the effects of different levels of biochar under high- and low-dose N application on soil chemical properties, soil enzyme activities, and the abundances of AOB, AOA, and NOB in double-cropping rice systems."

"Our results validate that the combined application of urea fertilizer and biochar enhanced soil chemical properties, enzymes activity, and the abundance of AOB. Ultimately, it also improved N uptake by rice plants, DM production, and grain yield in both early and late seasons."

"Therefore, in double-cropping rice systems, urea application at 135 kg ha−1 with biochar 20 or 30 t ha−1 provides appropriate soil C and N stocks, improves the microbial community, and raises rice yield."
