    "abstractText": "This paper presents a microfluidic thermal flowmeter for monitoring injection pumps, which is essential to ensure proper patient treatment and reduce medication errors that can lead to severe injury or death. The standard gravimetric method for flow-rate monitoring requires a great deal of preparation and laboratory equipment and is impractical in clinics. Therefore, an alternative to the standard method suitable for remote, small-scale, and frequent infusion-pump monitoring is in great demand. Here, we propose a miniaturized thermal flowmeter consisting of a silicon substrate, a platinum heater layer on a silicon dioxide thin-membrane, and a polymer microchannel to provide accurate flow-rate measurement. The present thermal flowmeter is fabricated by the micromachining and micromolding process and exhibits sensitivity, linearity, and uncertainty of 0.722 mW/(g/h), 98.7%, and (2.36 \u00b1 0.80)%, respectively, in the flow-rate range of 0.5\u20132.5 g/h when the flowmeter is operated in the constant temperature mode with the channel width of 0.5 mm. The measurement range of flow rate can be easily adjusted by changing the cross-sectional microchannel dimension. The present miniaturized thermal flowmeter shows a high potential for infusion-pump calibration in",

            "text": "An infusion pump is one of the most commonly used medical equipment in clinics. It delivers medical fluids (e.g., nutrients, medications, and contrast agents [1]) into a patient\u2019s circulatory system in controlled amounts and at precisely programmed rates. Due to its nature in delivering life-critical fluids, including high-risk medications, pump failures can lead to overdose, missed treatments or delayed therapy, thus significantly affecting patients\u2019 health and safety. The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) reported approximately 56,000 cases of adverse events associated with infusion pumps from 2005 to 2009, including numerous injuries and deaths [2]. One of the best-known failures of the infusion pump originates from its inaccuracy when the pump is used without calibration. While the medical guidance for the infusion pump suggests accuracy with a 5% maximum uncertainty [3,4], modern precision personal medicine and healthcare require highly controlled medication with timely infusion [5]. For example, drug infusions for neonates, infants, and small children should be able to deliver multiple doses with high concentrations at low flow rates [6]. This medical demand is a significant challenge in the lower range (<3.0 g/h) since delivering the low-volume liquid requires more precise fluidic control than delivering the high volume [6\u20138]. Therefore, a flow-rate sensor capable of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3151. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093151 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3151 2 of 11\ncalibrating the infusion pump within the low range is imperative to ensure the safety of patients. The standard calibration procedure for the infusion pump is based on the gravimetric method (GM) [1,9]. The GM uses a balance to measure the mass of injected fluid and calculates an SI-traceable flow rate (in the unit of g/h) through the mass change divided by injection time. Accurate GM requires a delicately controlled setup, such as draft shields, micro tubings, and dispensing needles, to counter any miscalibration from the fluid drift, evaporation, and bubbles [9]. Due to these requirements, the GM is typically performed in a well-controlled laboratory and is impractical to be deployed in hospitals, homecare, remote medical facilities, and en route care. An alternative to the GM suitable for these remote, small-scale, and frequent calibrations to the infusion pump is a great demand. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology has shown to be significant for the realization of a miniaturized flowmeter platform [10]. The MEMS flowmeter explored to date includes optical [11,12], mechanical [13\u201315], and thermal flowmeters [16\u201319]. Amongst these, the thermal flowmeters consisting of a few elements (e.g., metallic heaters and temperature sensors) are the most common due to their simplicity [19,20] and high sensitivity [21] compared to non-thermal flowmeters. The working principle of the thermal flowmeters is based on measuring the heat transfer from a heater to moving fluid (Figure 1) [17,18,22]. A simple thermal flowmeter can operate with a single heater by measuring (1) the heater temperature at constant heating power or (2) the power required to maintain the heater temperature constant (Figure 1b). However, one of the main challenges with the thermal flowmeters is slow response time (>1 min). Few flowmeters [18,22] have implemented heating elements on a wire or thin membrane to minimize the heat capacity and reduce their response time.\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 12\ncontrol than delivering the high volume [6\u20138]. Therefore, a flow-rate sensor capable of calibrating the infusion pump within the low range is imperative to ensure the safety of patients. The standard calibration procedure for the infusion pump is based on the gravimetric method (GM) [1,9]. The GM uses a balance to measure the mass of injected fluid and calculates an SI-traceable flow rate (in the unit of g/h) through the mass change divided by injection time. Accurate GM requires a delicately controlled setup, such as draft shields, micro tubings, and dispensi nee les, to counter any miscalibration fro the fluid drift, evaporation, and bubbles [9]. Due to th e requirements, the GM is typically performed in a well-controlled lab rat ry and is impr ctical to be deployed in hospitals, mec re, remote medical facilit es, and en route care. An alternative o the GM suitable for hes remote, small-scale, and fr quent calibra ions to he infusion p mp is a great demand. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology has shown to be signif cant for the realization of a miniaturized flowmeter platform [10]. The ME S flowmeter explored to date includes optical [1 ,12], c a ical [ ], and thermal flowmeters [ 6\u201319].

However, when they are used to measure liquids, the flow rate ranges in the high-flow regime (>50 g/h) [16,22,26]. A recent flowmeter [19] by D.

            "text": "The present flowmeter uses two different sensing modes: Constant Power (CP) and Constant Temperature (CT) [22,24]. The CP mode (left side of Figure 1b) measures heater temperature depending on the flow rate, while the heater power remains constant. As the flow rate increases, heater temperature decreases due to the increased heat transfer. A one-dimensional model of the heater temperature is described as follows [27]:\nTh = P\nkFwh ( lh \u03b4 + \u221a 4k + v\u03b424a2 ) (1) where Th is the heater temperature, P is the heat power, kF is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, wh is the heater width, lh is the heater length, \u03b4 is the boundary-layer thickness, v is the average flow velocity, a is the thermal diffusivity of fluid, k = 12 + kSitd/kF\u03b4 is the dimensionless factor, where kSi and td are the thermal conductivity of the silicon substrate and the membrane thickness, respectively. Although the resistance of the heater varies slightly depending on the flow rate, it can be assumed that the total power remains constant. Then, the right side of the Equation (1) is constant except v: Th is inversely proportional to \u221a\nv. In CT mode (right-side of Figure 1b), the external electric circuit adjusts the current\nso that the resistance (temperature) of the heating element is constant. As the flow rate increases, heating power needs to increase to compensate for heat loss and maintain the temperature. A one-dimensional model of heating power can be described from Equation (1) where Th is constant, and P is proportional to \u221a v. The thin membrane underneath the heater lowers the k factor, resulting in a lower P and Th requirement while maintaining sensitivity. In addition, the small heat capacity is advantageous to reduce the time to reach a steady-state, resulting in a fast response time. Figure 2 shows the schematic structure of the flowmeter. The flowmeter consists of a silicon substrate with a silicon dioxide/silicon nitride (SiO2/SiNx) membrane, a platinum (Pt) layer with heaters and electrodes, and a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channel layer (Figure 2a). Each heater is located on the silicon SiO2/SiNx membrane of 800 \u00b5m \u00d7 800 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.8 \u00b5m (Figure 2b). The membrane is designed with high sensitivity for flow measurement by allowing heat to be transferred only to the fluid and not to the substrate. A thinner and broader membrane is more beneficial for a rapid response time and high sensitivity. Therefore, we selected membrane thickness as 0.8 \u00b5m, more than 500 times thinner than the silicon substrate, to minimize heat convection through the substrate and maximize the heat convention through the fluid. In addition, because of ultralow heat capacity, response time could be reduced significantly with this feature. To determine the appropriate membrane width, we fabricated 600 um-, 800 um-, and 1000 umwide membranes (data not shown). We found that a 1000 um-wide membrane exhibited low fabrication yield and unstable mechanical durability during the flow measurement; thus, the 800 um-wide membrane was chosen as the optimal flowmeter platform. The composition of the membrane material consisted of 150 nm-thick SiNx sandwiched by 300 nm and 350 nm-thick SiO2 layers, which configuration can balance the residual stress (compressive stress for the SiO2 and tensile stress for SiNx) for the robust mechanical characteristics and flat morphology of the membrane [28]. Heaters on both sides serve as\nSensors 2022, 22, 3151 4 of 11\nreference sensors to monitor fluid temperature upstream and downstream (Figure 2c).

The heater has a total size of 0.19 mm \u00d7 0.20 mm and consists of serpentine electric lines with a width of 10 \u00b5m (Figure 2d). The heater is connected to 4 electrical connection lines for 4-wire remote sensing, able to serve as both heater and temperature sensor. Pt is chosen as the heater material because of good TCR (Temperature Coefficient of Resistance, 0.003729 K\u22121) [29] and biocompatibility suitable for biomedical flow sensing [27]. The PDMS channel height is 100 \u00b5m, and the width is 0.5 mm or 1.5 mm (Figure 2e). The narrow channel was selected as 0.5 mm, wide enough to fully cover the heater layer with 190 um-width. Then, the wider channel was chosen as 1.5 mm, three times wider than the narrow channel, to observe the effect of channel width. Finally, the channel height was selected as 0.1 mm due to fabrication ease using SU-8 2050. A 0.1 mm channel height exhibited a flow velocity of at least 10 mm/h at a 0.5 g/h flow rate, a crucial design factor because too-low flow velocity reduces flow-rate measurement sensitivity.

Since the output signal is directly relevant to the flow velocity, it is possible to tune the appropriate flow range depending on the target application by modifying the microchannel sizes (width and height). For example, if the channel height exceeds 100 \u00b5m, the flowmeter will detect a flow rate sensitively more than the 3.0 g/h flow range. On the other hand, a channel height lower than 100 \u00b5m would expect to provide a sensitive signal at a low flow range under 0.5 g/h.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3151 9 of 11 , , x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 2\nFigure 7.

The uncertainty of the flow rate measurement in CT mode can vary depending on the performance of the feedback system (e.g., frequency and resolution).

When the ambient temperature changes, the heat transfer to the fluid changes, increasing the flow-measurement uncertainty. A change in the water temperature causes changes in the amount of heat transferred from the heater to the water. For example, a 1 \u25e6C change in ambient temperature can result in approximately 0.3 g/h offset, significantly complicating the flowmeter accuracy. Therefore, minimizing the temperature change around the injection fluid and the flowmeter is necessary. One solution to the temperature variation issue is using a thermostat container that provides constant environmental temperature within 0.1 \u25e6C stability to improve measurement repeatability, deviation, and uncertainty. Noise level is an essential factor for sensor performance, especially for a signal-to-noise ratio and detection limit rather than accuracy. The typical way to minimize the effect of noise on the flowmeter accuracy is to average measured signals and baselines for a longer time so that the measurement data are close to the true value. High power (or high temperature) at the heater is beneficial for increasing the sensitivity of the sensor, but it can heat the substrate, making the hysteresis response of the sensor worse. It can also damage biological samples injected by the pumps. Therefore, selecting an appropriate heating power is required. In this study, 3 mW of heater power was used considering the sensitivity and hysteresis of the sensor. One of the critical issues with sensor research is the baseline drift. Even commercial off-the-shelf sensors suffer from drift, and frequent calibration is required to correct this. Several sensor works have adopted correction equations to compensate drift phenomenon for solving this issue. However, for ther al-type sensors such as the present flowmeter, the drift can occur when ambient temperature variati n is significant as a signal from the\nSensors 2022, 22, 3151 10 of 11\nheater only depends on the temperature. Therefore, we anticipate that signal drift may be minimal as long as the temperature is constant. The flowmeter could detect air bubbles. The air bubbles inside a fluid channel change the sensor signal dramatically due to a thermal property discrepancy between water and air. The size of the bubble can also be roughly detected through the duration of the signal. Since excessive bubble injection could have fatal consequences for the patient, bubble detection is one of the important functions required to monitor drug injection status. The present flowmeter aimed to monitor drug infusion for medical use, thus focusing on flow-rate measurement of water that is the solution for most infusion fluids (e.g., intravenous fluids). However, this flowmeter can expand its application to other fields (e.g., micromixers and chemical reactors) by characterizing the corresponding target chemicals such as isopropyl alcohol and ethanol. In addition, the present flowmeter can serve as a gas-velocity sensor by characterizing the heater responses to air flows. Since the thermal properties of each material are different, the flow-rate correction is required."

            "text": "A MEMS flowmeter with a microfluidic channel is designed and fabricated via micromachining to measure low flow rates for infusion-pump calibration. The MEMS flowmeter consisted of a silicon substrate, a Pt heater layer on a SiO2/SiNx thin-membrane, and a PDMS mold, with a size of 11.5 mm (width) \u00d7 17.5 mm (length) \u00d7 3 mm (height). The standard GM is applied to evaluate the performance of the flowmeter in two different modes (the CP and CT modes) and two different channel widths (0.5 mm and 1.5 mm). The flowmeter in the CT mode with a 0.5 mm-wide channel shows the optimal performance where the uncertainty is five times better than the commercial portable infusion pump in the 0.5\u20132.5 g/h range. In addition, the present flowmeter shows significant improvement in response time, power consumption, and flow-rate reading at low flow volume compared to previous flowmeters. The present flowmeter provides the potential to use as an on-chip on-demand or continuous self-calibration tool for the safe and effective use of infusion pumps in clinical applications.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, I.D. and D.S.; methodology, I.D.; software, I.D.; validation, I.D., D.S. and S.S.K.; formal analysis, D.S.; investigation, S.S.K.; resources, I.D.; data curation, D.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, I.D. and S.S.K.; visualization, D.S.; supervision, S.S.K.; project administration, I.D.; funding acquisition, I.D. and S.S.K.
