It is unclear whether this new approval has lowered the risk perception of recreational ketamine use. This is important given a recent increase in recreational ketamine use.\nMethods This study expanded on an existing longitudinal online study of the nightlife scene, by adding an additional longitudinal assessment as well as a new cross-sectional sample. Participants had to be aged 18-34 years, reside in the UK and have attended at least 6 electronic music events in the past year. The likelihood of increasing recreational ketamine use due to the approval, attitudes towards and risk perception of medical ketamine use and experiences resulting from recreational ketamine use were collected after the approval. Changes in ketamine use and frequency were assessed longitudinally before and after the approval.\nResults The overall sample size was 2415: 414 longitudinal (57% retention rate) and 2001 new crosssectional participants. The majority indicated no change in their likelihood of using recreational ketamine due to the approval of esketamine (87%). Longitudinal participants did not indicate an increase in past 12 month use or frequency after the approval. Only one-third of participants reported being aware of the approval. Participants previously aware showed greater overall support for medical use of ketamine than participants previously unaware of the change. However, an equally high risk was assigned to the recreational use of ketamine in both groups. Ketamine users indicated both increases as well as decreases in depression and anxiety as a result of ketamine use.\nConclusion The introduction of esketamine as an antidepressant was not associated with a change in the risk perception of recreational ketamine use in most participants, nor was it longitudinally associated with increased use. Potential negative effects of recreational ketamine use on mental health, as users in this sample reported, should be clearly communicated when discussing the benefits of (es-) ketamine in a therapeutic context.\nKeywords: ketamine, esketamine, policy change, nightlife, attitudes, risk"

            "text": "Two decades of research into ketamine as a treatment for major depressive disorder have culminated in the approval of esketamine, an enantiomer of ketamine, as a medication for treatment resistant depression (TRD) by the Federal Drug Administration (March 2019) and the European Medicines Agency (December 2019) in intranasal formulation (currently branded as SPRAVATOTM). Furthermore, in the years before the approval of esketamine an increase in the recreational use of ketamine had been recorded (Flatley, 2018; Grabski et al., 2021; Smith, 2017; Stripe, 2020; Van Laar et al., 2020). Even though recreational use of ketamine is still relatively low (3% in adults in England & Wales aged 16-24, <1% in adults in England and Wales aged 16-59), chronic use can have serious consequences such as cystitis, cognitive impairments and addiction (Morgan & Curran, 2014).\nAttitudes towards the introduction of esketamine and its acceptability as an antidepressant have been investigated in potential patients and carers (Jilka et al, 2021; Veraart et al., 2018) but very little is known about attitudes of recreational ketamine users. There is currently limited evidence on whether this approval might lead to the perception of ketamine as being less dangerous in a recreational context. Some evidence comes from a recent cross-sectional study conducted in New York City of 209 nightlife attendees: about 10% of participants indicated that media coverage of the medical benefits of ketamine would increase their likelihood to use more recreationally, yet in recent users of ketamine the likelihood was much higher (Palamar & Le, 2021). However, longitudinal data are currently lacking.\nOne study suggested that the introduction and commercialisation of medical cannabis in certain states in the United States of America (USA) was correlated with a lower risk perception of recreational use in adolescents in those states (Schuermeyer et al., 2014). However, it is unclear if this translated to an increase in recreational cannabis use (Sarvet et al., 2018). The approval of esketamine as a medicine for TRD is certainly different to the introduction of medical cannabis, as ketamine has been used medically for many decades for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. But there are also crucial differences between ketamine for anaesthesia and esketamine for TRD: firstly, esketamine is administered at a subanaesthetic dose, more similar to dosing in recreational use; and secondly, the nasal spray formulation enables the user (in theory) to use it \u201cad-hoc\u201d without medical supervision and outside a hospital setting, which has never been a possibility with ketamine for anaesthesia. Given the potentially serious consequences of chronic recreational ketamine use, assessing whether the recent approval of esketamine affects risk perception in individuals prone to recreational drug use is important. Furthermore, given the lack of up to date data, risk perceptions of consequences of ketamine use in users versus non- users and experiences of risky behaviours after ketamine use in users was assessed.\nData from the Eletronic Music Scene Survey United Kingdom (EMSS UK), an extension of the EMSS survey (Feltman et al., 2021; Waldron et al, 2020; Grabski et al., 2021) were used in order to address the following questions: 1) whether the risk perception of recreational ketamine use decreased following esketamine\u2019s approval as an antidepressant, 2) whether past 12 month use and frequency of ketamine use changed after esketamine\u2019s approval in a longitudinal sample, 3) attitudes towards medical and recreational ketamine, 4) risk perception of experiences as a result of ketamine use and actual experiences following ketamine use in this nightlife sample."

The EMSS UK extension was conducted in 2020, inviting EMSS participants from the UK to complete a third survey as well as recruiting a new sample of participants from the UK. This enabled the researchers to assess changes in use longitudinally before and after the approval of esketamine in 2019 and provided us with greater statistical power to assess attitudes and risk perceptions of ketamine.\nThe survey was administered online. Questions were based upon previous EMSS surveys, but to account for the Covid-19 pandemic participants\u2019 drug use variables were assessed twice: once assessing use before March 2020 (start of Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures in the UK) and once assessing use after March 2020. All data presented here relate to use in the 12 months before March 2020. Furthermore, questions covering recent policy changes relating to ketamine, attitudes about ketamine as an antidepressant, perceived risk of ketamine experiences and actual ketamine experiences were added to the EMSS UK.\nAll longitudinal UK participants who completed both previous EMSS surveys were invited to take part. Eligibility criteria at baseline were residing in the UK, being between 18-34 years old and having attended at least 6 dance/electronic music events during the past 12 months. Baseline recruitment was mostly online using convenience sampling through Facebook and Instagram advertisements. A small proportion (3%) of longitudinal participants was recruited offline at clubs and festivals. Longitudinal participants were invited to a third survey in June 2020 via email, the only contact information stored. Longitudinal survey completers were reimbursed with a \u00a310 Amazon voucher.\nCross-sectional participants were recruited between June and September 2020, utilizing the same inclusion criteria and online sampling methods as for the longitudinal sample at baseline, except that past 12 month attendance in at least 6 nightlife events was assessed before the start of Covid-19 measures in the UK (March 2020). They were included in a lottery to win electronic gadgets (2 MacBooks and 7 bluetooth speakers). This lottery was independent of previous lotteries held for the EMSS survey.\nWritten informed consent was obtained digitally from participants before the start of the survey and the study was approved by the University College London ethics committee (Ethics Project ID: 10437/003)."

Less than 20% of ketamine users indicated using fortnightly or more in the past 12 months (see Table 1). A comparison of longitudinal and crosssectional participants shows a comparable sample when taking the age difference into account (Supplementary materials, S1).\n<Insert Table 1 here>\nEffect of approval of esketamine as an antidepressant\nAll participants (N=2415) were included in this analysis, and answers were split into participants aware versus not aware of the approval. The majority (77%) indicated not being aware that ketamine had been approved as a treatment for TRD by the European Medicines Agency.\nThe majority indicated no change in their likelihood to use recreational ketamine based on these policy changes (87%), while 12% indicated being more likely to use recreational ketamine. There was a statistically significant difference in the likelihood of using recreational ketamine between participants previously aware and unaware of these policy changes (Z=-2.61, p=0.004), with those unaware indicating a slightly higher likelihood of using recreational ketamine. However, the effect size was very small (d=0.05).\nThe majority indicated no change in likelihood of using street ketamine for medical purposes (82%), while 16% indicated being more likely to use street ketamine for medical purposes. There was no statistically significant difference in the likelihood of using street ketamine for medical purposes between participants previously aware and unaware of these policy changes (Z=-0.57, p=0.291, d=0.01) (see Table 2).\n<Insert Table 2 here.>\nA subset analysis of longitudinal participants across all study timepoints (2017, 2018, 2020 \u2013 pre Covid-19) revealed no significant increase in past 12 month use between TP1 and TP2, however the lower bound of the confidence interval only marginally includes the null hypothesis (\u03c72[1]= 3.24, OR= 1.54, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.52, p=0.071). There was no significant difference in past 12 month use pre and post policy change between TP2 and TP3 (\u03c72[1]= 0.05, OR= 0.92, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.50, p=0.815). There was furthermore no difference in past 12 month use in longitudinal participants aware of the change (N=149, 36%) between TP1 and TP2 and no difference between TP2 and TP3. There was no difference in past 12 month use in longitudinal participants not aware of the change (N=265, 64%) between TP1 and TP2 and no difference between TP2 and TP3. There was a significant increase in frequency between TP1 and TP2 and a decrease between TP2 and TP3 in the overall sample (Table 3).\n<Insert Table 3 here.>\nAttitudes about ketamine as an antidepressant\nAll participants were included in this analysis (N=2415), and answers were split into participant aware versus not aware of the approval of esketamine. Of participants aware of the approval 61% endorsed the belief that ketamine was a safe and effective treatment for depression, whereas only 31% stated they believed so two years ago. The difference between the current and the past attitudes was statistically significant (Z=-15.31, p<0.001, d=0.55). In contrast, only 23% of participants unaware of the approval currently endorsed the belief that ketamine was a safe and effective treatment, and 10% stated they believed so two years ago. The difference between the current and the past attitudes was statistically significant (Z=-17.82, p<0.001, d=0.44).\nThe majority agreed that antidepressant use of ketamine was only acceptable when prescribed by a medical professional. Generally, participants unaware of the approval assigned a higher risk to medical use of ketamine for depression as well as other mental health indications than participants aware of the change. The risk of recreational ketamine use on the other hand was considered high in both groups, with 74% of aware participants and 71% of unaware participants agreeing that use was risky. The majority in both groups agreed that people who used street ketamine for medical purposes should not be prosecuted, but the agreement was much more pronounced in participants aware of the policy change (72%) than in those unaware (54%) (see Table 4).\n<Insert Table 4 here.>\nRisk perception of experiences after ketamine use\nAll participants (N=2415) were included in this analysis, and answers were split by lifetime ketamine use versus never use. The highest overall probability was assigned to experiencing cognitive impairments such as confusion (78%) and memory impairments (71%). High risks were also assigned to experiencing physical accidents (69%), being in a \u2018K-hole\u2019 (68%), and experiencing sleeping problems (53%). For sleeping problems, a much higher risk was assigned by never users (70%) than by ketamine users (30%).\nThe risk assessments about the effect of ketamine on mental health were mixed: more participants indicated a higher likelihood of being less depressed (43%) than of being more depressed after ketamine use (33%). In particular, the risk assigned to feeling more depressed was higher in non-users (45%) than in users (26%). For anxiety, the risk of feeling less anxious (41%) was rated similarly to\nthe risk of feeling more anxious (40%) after ketamine use. The likelihood of developing cystitis, a known side-effect from chronic ketamine use, was rated 32% (see Table 5).\n<Insert Table 5 here.>"

The most common experience following ketamine use was being in a \u2018K-hole\u2019 (53%). Forty-eight percent indicated experiencing confusion and 32% indicated experiencing memory impairments. Regarding effects on mental health, more participants indicated feeling less depressed after use (32%) than feeling more depressed (18%). For anxiety, similar numbers of participants indicated feeling less anxious after use (30%) and more anxious (26%). As for physical effects, 22% indicated having experienced sleeping problems, 13% having experienced abdominal cramps, 10% physical accidents, 6% cystitis, and less than 1% hypothermia. 13% indicated the experience of flashbacks and 9% indicated difficulties in reducing or stopping use (see Table 6).\n<Insert Table 6 here.>"

            "text": "This is the first study to assess changes in use behaviour and attitudes towards recreational ketamine use in the context of the recent approval of esketamine for TRD by the European Medicines Agency. The majority of participants indicated no greater likelihood to increase their recreational ketamine as a result of the approval. A subset analysis of longitudinal participants showed no increase in past 12 month use in the sample before and after the policy change (2018 - 2020), nor an increase in frequency of ketamine use during this period. This is promising, as half of the sample indicated use of ketamine in the past 12 month, thus representing a group open to recreational ketamine use and therefore potentially especially prone to a lower risk perception of ketamine use following policy changes.\nHowever, despite the high number of ketamine users in the sample, only one-third were aware of the introduction of esketamine as a medication for TRD. Those aware of the change differed from those not aware: more than half of participants aware of the introduction of esketamine had a favourable opinion towards ketamine as an antidepressant, compared to only a quarter of the participants unaware of the change. Both groups, however, indicated that this opinion was more favourable now than it would have been before the policy change. Generally, participants unaware of the approval\nrated the risk of medical ketamine use higher than those aware of it: for example, they were less in favour of the use of prescribed ketamine to treat other mental health conditions and assigned a higher probability to the risk of prescribed ketamine leading to the use of harder drugs. One important exception, however, was the risk of using recreational ketamine which was rated equally high by both groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that even though awareness of the introduction of esketamine as a medication for TRD lowers the risk perception of the medical use of ketamine, it does not seem to translate to recreational ketamine use. This result aligns with a recent study from New York City in which the majority of participants indicated no greater likelihood to use ketamine as a result of greater media coverage of its therapeutic benefits (Palamar & Le, 2021). Assessing the relationship of recreational ketamine use and media coverage in a UK population might be an important avenue for further research, especially as a recent study found local differences in how frequently medical ketamine was reported on and a frequent lack of a discussion of the risk of unregulated ketamine use (Gallagher et al., 2021)\nThe greatest risk of recreational ketamine use was assigned to cognitive impairments and physical accidents. Only a third of participants assigned a high risk to the development of cystitis, a known and well documented side effect of chronic ketamine use (Morgan & Curran, 2014). One reason for this finding might be that this is not a common experience in young nightlife attendees: only 6% of ketamine users in this sample indicated having experienced cystitis as a result of ketamine use. A previous study in recreational ketamine users in the nightlife scene found a much higher rate of urinary symptoms (27%), however ketamine dependence was also higher in this sample (Winstock et al., 2012). This current sample was comprised of mostly low to moderate users and cystitis is typically associated with chronic ketamine use. However, given the gravity, and often irreversibility, of this side effect, increased health warnings of risks specific to ketamine use escalation in populations prone to recreational use might be needed.\nFindings concerning the effects of ketamine on mental health were mixed: participants rated the possibility of increased as well as decreased anxiety similarly highly. The possibility of a decrease in depression was rated only slightly higher than the possibility of an increase in depression. These results were mirrored in the actual experiences of users in this sample. These ambiguous experiences have the potential to lead to confusion and might lead to the perception in some users, depending on the experiences of their peers and their information channels, that recreational ketamine is mostly beneficial for mental health. It is therefore important to communicate the risks of recreational ketamine use on mental health effectively, especially when reporting on the benefits of esketamine and ketamine prescribed in a medical context.\nThe current study has several limitations. First, in order to minimize the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated restrictions participants were asked about their ketamine use and frequency in the 12 months before March 2020. Most participants filled in the survey in June 2020 which might subject the ketamine use results of timepoint 3 to some degree of recall bias. Second, even though ketamine use in this sample was high, most users indicated low to moderate frequency of use. It is unclear whether a sample of mostly heavy users would be more likely to be influenced by the policy change. Third, actual changes in use could only be assessed in longitudinal participants (17% of the sample). Even though this seems to be comparable to the cross-sectional sample it might differ on unobserved variables and thus potentially introduce bias. Fourth, the longitudinal assessment of the third (post policy timepoint) assessed past 12 month use and frequency of ketamine before March 2020. As esketamine was approved by the EMA in December 2019 the assessed period does not completely fall into the post policy timepoint. However, it can be expected that the results would pick up initial changes in consumption. Furthermore, we are confident that this time window provides the best available data to assess our overall empirical question, because estimates from March 2020 onwards would have been strongly confounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifth, the eligibility criteria for the longitudinal sample were assessed at timepoint one, whereas for the cross sectional sample they were assessed at timepoint three. However, when taking this two year difference in age into account the sample are similar enough to be combined (see Tables S1, S2 & S3).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that that the introduction of esketamine as an antidepressant was not associated with risk perception of recreational ketamine use or use behaviour in the majority of this sample of young adults with a high prevalence of recreational and experimental substance use. This is particularly encouraging in light of a recent increase in recreational ketamine use in some countries (Flatley, 2018; Grabski et al., 2021; Smith, 2017, Stripe 2020,; Van Laar et al., 2020). However, our findings on risk perception and risk of ketamine use suggest that more information on the potential negative effects of recreational ketamine use, such as cystitis, should be communicated to users at the risk of escalation. Furthermore, negative effects of recreational ketamine use on mental health, as users in this sample reported, should be clearly communicated when discussing the benefits of (es-) ketamine in a therapeutic context."
