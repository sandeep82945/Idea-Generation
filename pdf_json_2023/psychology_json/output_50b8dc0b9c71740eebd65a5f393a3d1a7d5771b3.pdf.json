In this study, ADMETLab 2.0 was used to determine its important drug-related properties. 4- Hydroxyisoleucine is compliant with important drug-like physicochemical properties and pharma giants\u2019 drug-ability rules like Lipinski\u2019s, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) rules. Pharmacokinetically, it has been predicted to have satisfactory cell permeability. Blood\u2013brain barrier permeation may add central nervous system (CNS) effects, while a very slight probability of being CYP2C9 substrate exists. None of the well-known toxicities were predicted in silico, being congruent with wet lab results, except for a \u201cvery slight risk\u201d for respiratory toxicity predicted. The molecule is non ecotoxic as analyzed with common indicators such as bioconcentration and LC50 for fathead minnow and daphnia magna. The toxicity parameters identified 4-hydroxyisoleucine as nontoxic to androgen receptors, PPAR-\u03b3, mitochondrial membrane receptor, heat shock element, and p53. However, out of seven parameters, not even a single toxicophore was found. The density functional theory (DFT) study provided support to the findings obtained from drug-like property predictions. Hence, it is a very logical approach to proceed further with a detailed pharmacokinetics and drug development process for 4-hydroxyisoleucine.\nKEYWORDS\n4-hydroxyisoleucine, pharmacokinetics, computational chemistry, drug likeness, DFT"

            "text": "4-Hydroxyisoleucine (4HIL) is an amino acid which has been purified from Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek seeds; Fabaceae). Fenugreek is known for its antidiabetic properties in traditional medicine (Fowden et al., 1973; Abou El-Soud et al., 2007). 4-Hydroxyisoleucine increases insulin secretion via a direct effect on isolated islet cells both in rats and humans. The stimulating effect was strictly glucose dependent. Furthermore, it was shown that the insulinotropic effect is biphasic, without associated harm to other islet cells (\u03b1 and \u03b4-cells) and increase in insulin secretion by increasing glucose concentration (Sauvaire et al., 1998). 4- Hydroxyisoleucine reduces insulin resistance in the muscles and the liver by the activation of insulin receptor substrate-associated phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity. Reduction in body weight and plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels resulted from application of 4-hydroxyisoleucine. This plant-derived amino acid offers an attractive package for the treatment of the metabolic syndrome as a whole and also type 2 diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidaemias (Jett\u00e9 et al., 2000; Narender et al., 2006). Keeping in mind the pharmacological importance of 4HIL, its efficacy needs to be evaluated before it moves to trials and/or is dismissed. Undesirable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties or unacceptable toxicity are the main causes of the failure of drug candidates at the clinical trial stage (Jia et al., 2020).\nSince the concept of drug likeness was first proposed, it has become an important consideration in the selection of compounds with desirable bioavailability during the early phases of drug discovery. Over the past decade, online resources have facilitated drug-likeness studies in an economical and time-efficient manner. Michael J. Waring and colleagues compiled and analyzed the attrition of drug candidates from four pharma giants, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer. They reaffirmed that the control of physicochemical properties during structural optimization helps identify a compound of drug quality. Safety and toxicology are the largest sources of failure within the data set. However, none of the physicochemical descriptors correlate with preclinical toxicology outcomes (Waring et al., 2015).\nWhile considering the various pharmacology effects in different diseased conditions, we calculated various parameters related to drug discovery for 4-hydroxyisoleucine using ADMETLab 2.0. in order to predict the drug-like properties and safety profile and thereby therapeutic potentials."

            "text": "Various virtual labs are authorized to share the pharmacokinetic profile of pharmacologically active drug candidates such as SwissADME (Daina et al., 2017), FAF-Drugs4 (Lagorce et al., 2017), ADMETlab (Xiong et al., 2021), admetSAR (Yang et al., 2019), pkCSM (Pires et al., 2015), and ProTox-II (Banerjee et al., 2018). However, ADMETLab was selected because it provides predictive spectrum of multiple drug-likeness parameters and most of ADMET properties. The updated version, ADMETLab 2.0, has overpowered all known shortcomings of the older version while keeping its valuable advantages.\nThis virtual lab calculates 88 ADMET-related properties, i.e., 17 physicochemical parameters, 13 medicinal chemistry properties, 23 ADME properties, 27 toxicity endpoints, and eight toxicophore rules (751 substructures). ADMETLab 2.0 is freely accessible at https://admetmesh.scbdd.com. The 2D structure of 4-hydroxyleucine was drawn in ADMETLab 2.0 (Table 1). The user interface also offers string-based search. The search string for 4- hydroxyisoleucine is CC(O)C(C)C(N)C (=O)O.\nAn oral bioavailability graph obtained from SwissADMET was calculated using physicochemical characteristics. This graph uses six parameters, i.e., lipophilicity, insolubility, size, unsaturation, polarity, and flexibility, and defines appropriate ranges for oral bioavailability. The GI absorption (HIA), BBB penetration, and being Pgp substrate were also predicted with SwissADMET. The result is depicted as \u201cboiled egg\u201d having two areas: one for HIA (white) and another for BBB penetration (yolk). The background is a gray zone, indicating neither GI absorption nor BBB penetration.\nThe human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channels blockade is linked with fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The hERG K+ channel blockade was predicted with both ADMETLab 2.0 and pred-hERG 4.2. The pred-hERG 4.2, http://predherg.labmol.com.br, is a web tool for early detection of presumable hERG blockers and non-blockers, to predict cardiac toxicity.\nDFT studies were performed with Gaussian 16 software (Frisch et al., 2016). We optimized the 4-hydroxyisoleucine molecule without any symmetry constraints, checking different possible isomers (vide infra), and then performed frequency calculations to verify that the optimized structures were true energy minima.

We studied the 4- hydroxyisoleucine both in the gas phase (vacuum) and with the implicit effects from water (dielectric constant \u03b5 = 78.3553) as a solvent taken into account. In the second type of calculations, we used the self-reliable IEF-PCM approach (Tomasi et al., 2005) using the UFF default model as implemented in Gaussian 16 software, with the electrostatic scaling factor \u03b1 = 1.0. The charge analysis was performed using the natural bond orbital (NBO) method as implemented in Gaussian 16 program (Reed et al., 1988), using the B3LYP/Def2TZVP approach with the implicit water effects. Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) were computed at the B3LYP/Def2TZVP level with the implicit water effects as well.\nWe consider the calculated structures of the seven isomers of 4- hydroxyisoleucine, structural parameters for the lowest-lying isomer, its NBO charges, FMOs, and MEP. Furthermore, we used the values of the energies of the lowest-lying isomer, HOMO and LUMO, to compute its global reactivity parameters (GRP) (Geerlings et al., 2003; Chakraborty et al., 2013; Jorio et al., 2019) (Eqs 1\u20136).

It offers a prediction of the drug likeness of a chemical compound having a biological activity and designed for oral route of administration. The molecular weight of 4-hydroxyisoleucine is 147.09 g/mol, which reflects its suitability for oral drug development. This provides therapeutic convenience of its formulation as oral dosage form. The optimal range is 100\u2013600 approximately. The molecular volume to van der Waals volume ratio was calculated as 147.06. The number of hydrogen bond acceptors (nHA; optimal: 0\u201312) is 4. The number of hydrogen bond donors (nHD; optimal: 0~7) is also 4. 4-Hydroxyisoleucine has three rotatable bonds only (optimal: 0~11).\nThere are no rings or cyclic groups in 4-HIL (optimal: 0\u20136). There are four heteroatoms in 4-hydroxyisoleucine, which satisfy the range 1~15 given by ADMETLab. There is no formal charge on this molecule. A charge range of \u22124~4 is devised as standardized\nparameter for a drug candidate. The number of rigid bonds may range from 0 to 30; 4HIL has a single rigid bond. This makes the molecule flexible enough to achieve a stable conformation at its target. In this continuity, the flexibility value is 3.0 obtained as ratio of nRot/nRig. The molecule has three stereo centers which is somewhat closer to the optimal value of \u22642. A stereo center may achieve a different conformation at the active site. The topological polar surface area (TPSA) for 4-hydroxyisoleucine is 83.55.\nThe aqueous solubility (logS) is 0.06, falling within the range of \u22124~0.5 log mol/L. LogP value is the Log of octanol/water partition coefficient whose optimal range is 0~3. A higher logP value implies greater lipophilicity, and this depends upon molecular size, polarity, and hydrogen bonding. LogP value of 4-hydroxyisoleucine is \u22122.63 which reflects its partition into water compartment. This value is congruent to LogS value described previously. The value of logP at normal physiological pH 7.4 is logD. For 4-hydroxyisoleucine it is calculated as \u22120.93 just below the optimal range of 1~3.

As can be seen from Figure 3, the isomers differ from each other by orientations of 4- hydroxy and amino groups and hydrogens of the carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups. The lowest-lying isomer 5 (Figure 3) has the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxyl group and amino group located on the same molecule side and the 4- hydroxy group located in the plane approximately perpendicular to the carboxyl group, with hydrogen bonds formed between the 4- hydroxy and amino groups and between the amino group and the\ncarbonyl oxygen of the carboxyl group (see more detailed discussion later). Furthermore, from Table 8, it follows that all six higher-lying 4-hydroxyisoleucine isomers are quite close in energy to the global minimum isomer 5, being within 0.09 (isomer 3)\u20132.89 (isomer 7) kcal/mol higher in energy. We focus on the more detailed consideration of only the lowest-lying isomer 5. Further consideration of Table 4 data shows that all seven isomers have significant HOMO/LUMO gaps, 6.51\u20137.07 eV, with the isomer 5 having the HOMO/LUMO gap value 6.86 eV, the highest in energy isomer 7 having the smallest HOMO/LUMO gap value, 6.51 eV, and the second lowest-lying isomer 3 having the largest HOMO/LUMO gap value, 7.07 eV.\nFigure 4 presents the selected bond distances, \u00c5 (Figure 4A), NBO charges on the selected atoms (Figure 4B), FMOs (Figure 4C), and MEP plot (Figure 4D) for the lowest-lying isomer 5. As aforementioned, there are several intermolecular hydrogen bonds in this isomer, between the 4-hydroxy group hydrogen and amino group nitrogen (bond distance, 2.166 \u00c5), between the amino group hydrogens and the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxyl group (bond distances, 2.652 and 3.097 \u00c5), and within the carboxyl group, 2.307 \u00c5. Thus, as can be seen, intra- and also intermolecular hydrogen bonds can be formed by 4- hydroxyisoleucine, which might explain the presence of several isomers close in energy. Furthermore, NBO charge analysis (Figure 4B) shows noticeable negative charges on the oxygens and nitrogen of the molecular functional groups, \u22120.625 to \u22120.835 e, along with noticeable positive charges on the hydrogens of these functional groups, 0.372\u20130.503 e. These charges would explain the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds along with intermolecular interactions. The HOMO and LUMO plots (Figure 4C) show that essentially the whole molecule contributes to FMOs, thus being able to participate in potential processes of donating/ accepting electrons. Finally, analysis of the MEP plot\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org08\n(Figure 4D) shows accumulation of both negative (as indicated by red color) and positive (as indicated by blue color) electrostatic potential in the molecule. Negative MEP is accumulated on the carboxyl oxygens and on the 4-hydroxy oxygen, whereas positive MEP is accumulated on the amino group, carboxyl group hydrogen, and 4-hydroxy group hydrogen. This implies that the 4-hydroxyisoleucine molecule can behave both as a nucleophilic and electrophilic agent in chemical reactions. Also, these MEP accumulations imply possibility of intermolecular interactions for this compound.\nTable 8 summarizes the values of the GRPs calculated according to Eqs 1\u20136 (see Materials and Methods section).\nAnalysis of the GRP values in Table 9 shows the following. 1) The 4-hydroxyisoleucine compound has quite a high IP value, 7.21 eV, but low EA value, 0.35 eV. This implies that this compound should be a poor electron donor and a relatively poor electron acceptor, or, in other words, should be relatively stable in redox processes, which is also supported by its significant HOMO/LUMO gap value, 6.86 eV. 2) The global\nelectronegativity X and global hardness \u03b7 values of this compound are quite noticeable, 3.78 and 3.43 eV, respectively, which would imply that this compound might show electrophilic behavior in chemical processes but also should be relatively nonreactive and thus thermodynamically stable, which is also supported by its large HOMO/LUMO gap and noticeable value of its chemical potential, \u22123.78 eV. 3) Furthermore, the global softness of the compound has low value, 0.146 eV, which supports the relatively low reactivity of the compound, and global electrophilicity of the compound can be considered as relatively noticeable, 2.083 eV, which would imply that this compound might show electrophilic behavior in chemical processes."

These properties have been associated with 90% of the orally active drugs that have achieved phase II clinical status (Lipinski, 2004). 4- Hydroxyisoleucine is compliant with one of the most acceptable drug-like parameters. Passing RO5 means acceptable aqueous solubility along with intestinal permeability, which are the first steps in oral bioavailability. The RO5 has found its importance where medicinal and combinatorial chemistry produced thousands of compounds with very poor physicochemical properties. However, passing RO5 never guaranteed that a compound will be drug-like. But if a compound fails, then a high probability of oral activity problems exists.\nThe molecular weight of 4-hydroxyisoleucine is 147.09, which is ideal for oral drug designing. The intrinsic molecular volume is considered as a molecular descriptor in modeling physicochemical properties and the biological activity. The molecular volume is one\nof the most common descriptors in quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) studies (Leahy, 1986; McGowan and Mellors, 1986; Consonni et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2003a). It is related to different physicochemical properties and biological processes including intestinal absorption and BBB penetration, to name a few (Zhao et al., 2003b). The number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors are within the required strict limits. Oral drugs usually have fewer H-bond acceptors, H-bond donors, and rotatable bonds (Bitew et al., 2021).\nThe parameter of rotatable bond count is used as \u201cdrug filter.\u201d More than 10 rotatable bonds are associated with decreased rat oral bioavailability (Veber et al., 2002). The mechanistic basis for this \u201crotatable bond filter\u201d is not clear, since its count does not relate to the in vivo clearance rate in rats. However, the filter still remains reasonable from a viewpoint of in vitro screening as ligand affinity decreases at an average of 0.5 kcal for each two rotatable bonds (Dashti et al., 2014). The number of aromatic and heteroaromatic rings in a molecule has a relation with aqueous solubility, lipophilicity, oral bioavailability, serum albumin binding, CYP450 inhibition, and hERG inhibition. The fewer the aromatic rings in an oral drug candidate, the greater is the developable probability of a drug candidate. However, >3 aromatic rings in a molecule are linked with poorer compound developability and an"

Even within the defined lipophilicity range, increasing aromatic rings lead to decreased aqueous solubility (Ritchie and Macdonald, 2009).\nSaturated heterocycles are metabolized at the position of heteroatom or adjacent to it (Jean and Fotsch, 2012). The heteroatom is sometimes beneficial in drug metabolism like nitrogen in 4-hydroxyisoleucine. Redox reactions of drug metabolism such as heteroatom dealkylation, hydroxylation, heteroatom oxygenation, reduction, and dehydrogenation can yield active metabolites. Rarely, even conjugation reactions can give rise to an active metabolite (Obach, 2013). 4-Hydroxyisoleucine has a single rigid bond. This makes the molecule flexible enough to achieve a stable conformation at its target. The optimal range for drug-like property, TPSA, is 0\u2013140 \u00c52, that of 4-Hydroxyisoleucine within accurate limit (83.55 \u00c52). Molecules with a TPSA of \u2265140 \u00c52 would be poorly absorbed (<10% of the fraction absorbed), while a TPSA of 60 \u00c52 favors >90% absorption (Clark, 1999).\nThe calculation of QED score uses eight important properties that were previously used to assess drug-likeness, i.e., molecular weight, octanol\u2013water partition coefficient (ALOGP), number of H-bond donors, number of H-bond acceptors, molecular polar surface area, number of rotatable bonds, number of aromatic rings, and number of structural alerts (ALERTS). ALERTS is a list of undesirable chemical features such as chemical reactivity or perceived toxicity. Drugs with high QED scores achieve higher absorption and bioavailability, have lower doses, fewer drug\u2013drug interaction warnings and P-glycoprotein interactions, and lower absorption issues due to a food-related effect. Nonetheless, it is surprising that high QED-scoring drugs have similarities to lowscoring drugs with respect to plasma free fraction, the extent of gutwall metabolism, first-pass hepatic extraction/metabolism, volume of distribution, clearance, elimination half-life, and frequency of dosing (Ritchie and Macdonald, 2014). In this context, 4- hydroxyisoleucine lies at the borderline of attractive and unattractive molecules. Thus, this negligible amount of difference may not provide an impetus for rejection.\nFsp3 is the fraction of sp3 carbon atoms. It is the number of sp3hybridized carbons out of the total carbon count which tells about carbon saturation of molecules and characterizes the complexity of their spatial structure (Lovering et al., 2009). Natural products generally possess a higher fraction of sp3 than synthetic compounds and so become a rich source of drugs (Jia et al., 2020). Yan and Gesteiger (2003) used it to characterize aliphatic degrees of molecules and ultimately predict solubility (Yan and Gasteiger, 2003). The optimum value of \u22650.42 for Fsp3 is considered a suitable value, and about 84% of marketed drugs meet this criterion (Kombo et al., 2013). However, sp3 content should be increased within an appropriate range; higher Fsp3 score does not always assure higher performance and can increase the difficulty of synthesis (Gerlach et al., 2019). However, critical discussions of Fsp3 scoring have helped in generating new potential descriptors, such as MCE-18, which is discussed in the following paragraphs, and calculated using the following equation (Wei et al., 2020).\nMCE-18 AR + NAR + CHIRAL + SPIRO + sp3 + cyc \u2212 Acyc/1 + sp3( ) xQ1.\nA simple sp3 index (number of sp3-hybridized carbon atoms) can lead to a high rate of false-positive results, while the issue can be\nsolved with MCE-18 descriptor. The composition, spatial geometry, and complexity of chemical structures especially for state-of-the-art molecules are not considered in sp3 index, as these special features cannot be reflected using only the portion of sp3-hybridized carbons. They focus on the nature and quality of sp3-rich frameworks rather than sp3 counts only (Ivanenkov et al., 2019).\n4-Hydroxyisoleucine is a naturally derived molecule, and therefore, MCE-18 may not be the only guide toward drug discovery. MCE-18 is applied for the assessment of pharmacological novelty and may help in designing new potential chemical entities in modern drug design. This index is also used for profiling HTS-focused libraries and prioritization of molecules. Presumably, compounds with optimal MCE-18 values have greater reliable IP positions. It is a tracer of medicinal chemistry evolution and is used to assess the \u201cdistance\u201d between old and new chemistry. During the past 10 years, two of the top four pharmaceutical companies have primarily focused on molecules with MCE-18 values over 60, while the remaining two companies have demonstrated less drug productivity but have reached similar scores (Ivanenkov et al., 2019). The natural product score is congruent with the real-time natural source of 4- hydroxyisoleucine, namely, fenugreek seeds (Fowden et al., 1973).\n4-Hydroxyisoleucine is compliant with the Lipinski rule, Pfizer rule, and GSK rule. The parameters for the Pfizer rule are logP >3 and TPSA <75. Compounds with higher log P (>3) and low TPSA (<75) are more likely to be toxic. The most significant work which describes the influence of molecular properties on toxicological outcomes has led to the \u201c3/75 rule.\u201d This has been devised by Pfizer from an analysis of exploratory or dose-finding toxicology studies of 245 compounds. This approach defined that compound with logP <3 and tPSA >75\u00c52 are expected to be nontoxic (Hughes et al., 2008; Waring et al., 2015). However, 4- hydroxyisoleucine is non-toxic and classified as safe with the Pfizer rule. The GSK rule suggests MW \u2264 400 and logP \u22644 (Hann, 2011) which are well qualified by 4-hydroxyisoleucine. The Golden Triangle aids in achieving metabolically stable and permeable drug candidates. It is a visualization tool developed with three parameters i.e., in vitro permeability, in vitro clearance, and computational data (Johnson et al., 2009). However, the stability and permeation of 4-hydroxyisoleucine is already demonstrated (Gowtham et al., 2022). Thus, the predicted Golden Triangle rejection may be ruled out here.\nPAINS, ALARMNMR, BMS, and chelator rule are in favor of 4- hydroxyisoleucine. Pan assay interference compounds have a tendency to produce false-positive hits in high-throughput screening. The mechanism of PAINS activity is poorly understood. However, PAINS are associated with protein reactivity and non-covalent interactions (Bolz et al., 2021). ALARM NMR is critical to recognize reactive compounds that should be prioritized for lead optimization. This has emerged as a new filtering tool that can identify nuisance compounds and ultimately improve the process of hit triage. It is a La assay to detect reactive molecules by NMR by monitoring dithiothreitoldependent 13C chemical shift changes brought in the human La antigen (Huth et al., 2005; Zega, 2017; Dahlin et al., 2018). Thiol reactive compounds oxidize or form covalent adducts with thiol groups of proteins. Therefore, ALARM NMR is a sensitive tool to rapidly identify compounds with increased risk of side effects in\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org11\nhumans, such as alcohol intolerance, reactive oxygen species generation, and drug\u2013drug interactions (Huth et al., 2007). The BMS is an alert for mapping molecular promiscuity and identification of undesirable and reactive compounds, while the chelator rule reflects chelating compounds (Agrawal et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2021).\nCaco-2 cell lines are still widely used in absorption studies. Sometime regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d technique, Caco-2 cells are used to validate other absorption assays (Artursson et al., 2001; Hidalgo, 2001; Ding et al., 2021; Murador et al., 2021). 4- Hydroxyisoleucine has a lower Caco-2 cell-predicted permeability. However, a considerable chance of MDCK permeability exists. The MDCK cell line is also used for permeability screening in drug discovery (BOKULI\u0106 et al., 2022). However, both ADMETLab 2.0 and SwissADME are in favor of better gastrointestinal absorption and bioavailability, indicated by the boiled-egg plot as well. However, there are no permeability results available from wet labs. 4-Hydroxyisoleucine is safe from clinically significant drug interactions. The absorption and excretion of Pgp substrate can be modified by its inducer/inhibitor, ultimately paving the way for drug interaction (Yamazaki et al., 2019). A Pgp inhibitor is more likely to have interactions (Telbisz et al., 2021; Terrier et al., 2021). ADMETLab 2.0 and SwissADME declared it as a non-Pgp substrate, diminishing the risk of potential drug interactions and drug resistance mechanisms. Metabolic enzyme inducers or inhibitors can increase or decrease the blood level of another drug which is a substrate for the target enzyme. This can lead to several pharmacokinetic drug interactions with CYP inhibitors or inducers (Bolleddula, 2021; Lang et al., 2021). Only a marginal chance of being CYP2CP substrate is predicted for 4- hydroxyisoleucine. However, no other risk exists for a significant drug interaction. To date, there are no studies available on 4- hydroxyisoleucine\u2013Pgp interactions. Studies on the metabolism of 4-hydroxy isoleucine are also desirable to establish a complete pharmacokinetic profile.\nSome of the pharmacokinetic parameters of 4- hydroxyisoleucine (10 mg/kg) were estimated after oral administration in Wistar rats using the ultra-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry-based method. The Vd was estimated as 3,123.59 \u00b1 355.86 mL/kg (Wadhwa et al., 2020), which is lower than that calculated by ADMETLab. The clearance of 4-hydroxyisoleucine appeared to be 204.95 \u00b1 23.97 mL/h/kg which is less than the rate determined by ADMETLab. However, the t1/2 10.83 \u00b1 1.96 h is almost equivalent to that determined by ADMETLab (Wadhwa et al., 2020). The long half-life is congruent with the low clearance rate of 4-hydroxyisoleucine.\nA drug with a moderate clearance rate and a better half-life may provide dose flexibility and better patient compliance (Sleep et al., 2013). Also, 4-hydroxy isoleucine is assumed to have a desirable clearance rate and half-life. However, a risk of CNS unwanted effects can be expected as 4-hydroxyisoleucine has the probability to be BBB permeant according to ADMETLab 2.0. Contrary to this, the boiled-egg plot predicted with SwissADME showed that it is nonpermeant across the BBB (Daina and Zoete, 2016).\nWhile evaluating toxicity, not even a single risk was found for hERG blockade, H-HT, DILI, Ames toxicity, rat oral acute toxicity, skin sensitization, carcinogenicity, and ophthalmic toxicity. Cardiac\narrhythmia is one of the most frequently encountered side effects during drug discovery. This effect is related to inhibition of the hERG cardiac potassium channel. Also, this is the reason regulatory agencies such as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency recommend early evaluation of hERG toxicity (Garrido et al., 2020). Both ADMETLab 2.0 and Pred-hERG defined 4-hydroxyisoleucine as non-hERG blocker, being safe from cardiotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity is also highly responsible for withdrawal of an approved drug from the market. Hepatotoxicity accounts for >50% of acute liver failure cases as > 600 drugs are associated with it (Williams, 2018). Drug-induced liver injury is one of the leading factors of drug failure in clinical trials. Therefore, its assessment of drug candidates is necessary in advance as an effective strategy to decrease the drug attrition rate (He et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2020). The Ames toxicity test is an indicator for assessing mutagenic compounds\u2019 potential and use bacteria for this assay. 4- HIL is likely to be safe from these types of toxicities (Petkov et al., 2021). However, the risk of respiratory toxicity has yet to be determined.\nToxicity studies on 4-hydroxyisoleucine are scant; however, studies on standardized extracts of its natural origin exist. Singh et al. (2022) evaluated the toxicity of 4-hydroxyisoleucine using human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) and healthy rats. The viability of HEK-293 cells was not affected by 4-hydroxyisoleucine, and no signs of toxicity were observed in healthy rats. Another study by Swaroop et al. identified Trigonella foenum-graecum seed extract (source of 4-Hydroxyisoleucine) as safe and efficacious. After extensive acute oral toxicity, 28 days\u2019 sub-chronic toxicity and Ames\u2019 bacterial reverse mutation assay, no toxicity was detected (Swaroop et al., 2014).\nDeshpande et al. observed IDM01 (4-hydroxyisoleucine and trigonelline-based standardized fenugreek seed extract) as safe during acute and sub-chronic preclinical toxicity in rats without mutagenicity or genotoxicity. Not a single mortality or treatmentrelated adverse sign was noted during acute (\u22642000 mg/kg) and subchronic (90-day repeated doses of 250/500/1,000 mg per kg body weight with 28 days of recovery period). The oral median lethal dose (LD50) was >2,000 mg/kg during the acute oral toxicity study. A non-observed adverse effect level was estimated at 500 mg/kg. The Ames test did not exhibit any mutagenicity up to 5,000 \u03bcg/plate and did not induce any structural chromosomal aberrations at < 50 mg/ culture (Deshpande et al., 2017).\nA genotoxicity study of the fenugreek seed extract (\u226440% 4- hydroxyisoleucine) was carried out via standard battery of tests such as reverse mutation assay, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, and mouse micronucleus assay. There was no genotoxicity exhibited under the tested conditions (Flammang et al., 2004).\nBioconcentration represents the accumulation of chemicals in organisms at higher concentration than its surrounding (Jambor and Weisener, 2005). Bioconcentration factors are considered to assess secondary poisoning potential and risks to human health via the food chain. The factor is an estimate of the residual organic chemicals used for ranking chemicals as possible hazards to the environment (Gramatica and Papa, 2003). Similarly, the toxicity of organic aromatic compounds is based on logarithm of 50% growth inhibitory concentration (log (IGC50-1)) of Tetrahymena pyriformis, and fathead minnow which have extensive use in ecotoxicology and environmental safety applications (Keshavarz et al., 2021). The\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org12\nenvironmental toxicity of 4-hydroxyisoleucine exhibited a higher LC50, favoring the evidence of being non-ecotoxic. But the most acceptable evidence can be its origin as natural product, being part of nature chemistry (Avalos-Soriano et al., 2016). In the same manner, no risk of toxicity is predicted for androgen and estrogen receptors, PPAR-\u03b3, heat shock element, mitochondrial membrane potential, and p53 (Bova et al., 2005; Ciocca et al., 2013; Khoo et al., 2014; Barna et al., 2018; Wahl and Smie\u0161ko, 2018; Xi et al., 2020; Ciallella et al., 2021). Androgen-disruptors include all those chemicals which interfere with the biosynthesis, metabolism, or its physiological action. This results in an abnormal male development characteristic and poor growth and function of reproductive tract. Since androgen is the main regulator, its disruptors can harm reproductive developmental processes (Luccio-Camelo and Prins, 2011). In the same manner, estrogen disruptors can harm the female reproductive programming as the estrogen receptor is the primary determinant of female characteristics (Tsakovska et al., 2011). However, 4-hydroxyisoleucine is devoid of such toxicities and is considered non-toxic.\nMitochondrial membrane potential is generated by proton pumps and one of the essential components in the energy storage process. It is kept stable, and little variations are allowed; however, long-lasting disturbance may lead to adverse pathologies and loss of cell viability (Zorova et al., 2018). 4-Hydroxyisoleucine is free from such disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Similarly, genetic toxicology is important for long-term carcinogenicity during the early drug development process. This genotoxicity testing can identify the potentially hazardous drug candidates which may be knocked out at later stages of the drug development process (Custer and Sweder, 2008). However, ADMETLab recommends 4-hydroxyisoleucine as non-carcinogenic and non-genotoxic.\nAs all these parameters are modifiers of normal human physiology, and their disturbance leads to a red alert toxicity. Furthermore, none of the toxicophores were found in 4-hydroxyisoleucine whichmay have led to aquatic toxicity, skin sensitization, or created an acute toxicity response. The molecule has proven to be biodegradable and is not enlisted in the SureChEMBL database, implying medicinal chemistry friendly status (Papadatos et al., 2016; Falaguera andMestres, 2021). The DFT study results provide certain support for the aforementioned discussion. Thus, formation of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds by the 4-hydroxyisoleucine molecules, along with negative and positive MEP accumulation and significant NBO charges, would imply strong interactions with polar solvent molecules, including water, and thus acceptable aqueous solubility of the compound. Also, this would imply interaction of the 4-hydroxyisoleucine molecules with polar parts of large organic molecules. Furthermore, the shown presence of a few H-bond donors and acceptors would support the suggestion of the potential of the compound as an oral drug. Moreover, formation of several low-lying structural isomers confirms that themolecule is flexible enough to achieve a stable conformation at its target. The 4- hydroxyisoleucine stability shown by the GRP analysis supports its long half-life and stability findings achieved by other approaches."

The pharmacokinetic profile is in the favor of oral bioavailability, efficient distribution to all tissues including the brain, and non-interruptive drug metabolism, with moderate clearance and half-life. Some of the actual PK parameters are almost comparable to in silico values, but further detailed studies are desirable in the lab. There is no risk of any toxicity predicted both in silico and inside lab, except with low probability of respiratory toxicity predicted. Even it is undesirable for this molecule to disturb some of the most important receptors/targets such as gonadal receptors, p53, heat shock factor, mitochondrial membrane potential, or PPAR-\u03b3. The molecule is safe for the environment, with agreeable lethal concentrations for some of the most common indicators. Finally, not a single toxicophore alert was found for 4-hydroxyisoleucine. All these properties suggest the drug ability of 4-hydroxy isoleucine. DFT study results are in support of the findings obtained by other methods."
