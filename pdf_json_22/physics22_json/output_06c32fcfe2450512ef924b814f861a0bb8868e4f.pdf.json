    "abstractText": "We derive Ward identities for fermionic systems exhibiting a gauge symmetry that gets globally broken. In particular, we focus on the relation that connects the gauge field response functions to the transverse susceptibilities of the order parameter. We find that the long-wavelength and zero-energy limit of the former are related to the coefficients of a low-energy expansion of the latter. We examine three physical cases: the superconductor, the N\u00e9el antiferromagnet, and the spiral magnet. In the case of a metallic spiral magnet that completely breaks the SU(2) spin symmetry, we explicitly show that the Ward identities are fulfilled within the random phase approximation. We subsequently derive microscopic expressions for the spin stiffnesses and spin-wave velocities, which can be plugged into low-energy models to study the effect of long-wavelength bosonic fluctuations on top of mean-field solutions.",

Bonetti Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany\n(Received 25 April 2022; revised 5 August 2022; accepted 27 September 2022; published 3 October 2022)\nWe derive Ward identities for fermionic systems exhibiting a gauge symmetry that gets globally broken. In particular, we focus on the relation that connects the gauge field response functions to the transverse susceptibilities of the order parameter. We find that the long-wavelength and zero-energy limit of the former are related to the coefficients of a low-energy expansion of the latter. We examine three physical cases: the superconductor, the N\u00e9el antiferromagnet, and the spiral magnet. In the case of a metallic spiral magnet that completely breaks the SU(2) spin symmetry, we explicitly show that the Ward identities are fulfilled within the random phase approximation. We subsequently derive microscopic expressions for the spin stiffnesses and spin-wave velocities, which can be plugged into low-energy models to study the effect of long-wavelength bosonic fluctuations on top of mean-field solutions.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.106.155105\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSymmetries play a prominent role in several branches of physics. In condensed-matter systems, they often allow for making rigorous statements about the nature of a phase transition or provide insightful information about entire phases. A renowned example is the Goldstone theorem [1], which predicts the number of gapless modes when a global continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, irrespective of the microscopic details of the system. In some systems, a global invariance is promoted to a local one with the introduction of a gauge field.\nIn this case, constraints for the correlation functions can be derived, corresponding to fundamental conservation laws. These exact relations, going under the name of Ward (or Ward-Takahashi) identities [2,3], play a key role in the development of approximations to tackle the many-body problem [4\u20137], as it is desirable for a method to satisfy them. Many works have been produced with this aim, focusing, among others, on the consistency of many-body approximations [8\u201312] or on the gauge invariance of response functions [13\u201315]. Ward identities have also been analyzed in systems with broken symmetries, such as ferromagnets [9,16] or superconductors [17\u201320]. Some of the most considered Ward identities are those which impose constraints relating singleparticle properties (as the self-energy) to the two-particle correlators (the vertex functions), providing a benchmark on\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

We consider the gauge field as an external perturbation and probe the linear response of the system to it, thus preserving the massless character of the Goldstone modes. We derive a functional identity from which a hierarchy of exact constraints for correlation functions can be extracted. We focus on the Ward identity connecting the linear response to the external gauge field and the transverse susceptibilities of the order parameter, containing information on the Goldstone gapless excitations. In particular, we show that the low frequency and momentum expansion of the inverse of the susceptibilities is related to precise limits of the gauge field response kernel. We discuss three examples: a superconductor breaking the U(1) charge symmetry, a N\u00e9el antiferromagnet breaking the SU(2) spin symmetry leaving a residual U(1), and a spiral magnet, completely breaking SU(2). Similar relations can be found in the literature for special cases (see, for example, Ref. [21]). Here we provide a formal derivation within a formalism that allows us to extend them to any system and any possible kind of long-range order that breaks a continuous symmetry. These identities are of fundamental relevance, as from the sole knowledge of the local symmetry group, one can infer the form of the transverse susceptibilities for small energies and long wavelengths. This is reminiscent of and intimately connected to hydrodynamic theories for systems exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking, such as superfluid helium [22] or magnets [23,24]. Moreover, when the gauge field is of pure gauge, that is, it can be removed by means of a local transformation, the Ward identities are useful to derive a low-energy theory for the slow directional fluctuations of the order parameter in the fashion of nonlinear sigma models [25].\nWe focus particularly on the case of doped antiferromagnets that host low-lying fermionic excitations, forming small\n2469-9950/2022/106(15)/155105(17) 155105-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nFermi surfaces. We show that from the Ward identities, one can compute a dynamical transverse susceptibility \u03c7\u22a5dyn \u2261 lim\u03c9\u21920 \u03c7\u22a5(q = 0, \u03c9) and a spin stiffness J and extract the spin-wave velocity as cs = \u221a J/\u03c7\u22a5dyn. This is in contrast with the hydrodynamic approach of Refs. [23,24], which predicts cs = \u221a J/\u03c7\u22a5, with \u03c7\u22a5 \u2261 limq\u21920 \u03c7\u22a5(q, \u03c9 = 0) the uniform transverse susceptibility. As noted in Ref. [26], the equality \u03c7\u22a5 = \u03c7\u22a5dyn holds only for insulating antiferromagnets at low temperatures, as the spin systems considered in Refs. [23,24]. Furthermore, as a consequence of the doping, N\u00e9el antiferromagnetism is often destroyed, making way to a coplanar spiral magnet. In this state, the spins are no longer antiferromagnetically ordered but the magnetization rotates in a plane, completely breaking the SU(2) rotational symmetry and giving rise to three rather than two Goldstone modes [27\u201330]. Spiral states have been found to emerge in the twodimensional Hubbard model and in the t-J model at moderate hole doping away from half filling, and they are possible candidates for the incommensurate magnetic correlations observed in the cuprate superconductors [31\u201340]. They have also been proposed in the context of frustrated antiferromagnets [41\u201347]. We present a direct evaluation of the Ward identities for a metallic spiral magnet via the random phase approximation (RPA), and derive expressions for the spin stiffness and dynamical susceptibility of each gapless mode. These formulas generalize to finite temperature and doping and to spiral magnetic states, the previously derived expressions for spin stiffnesses in the ground state at half filling [21,48]. This formalism represents a convenient starting point to study longwavelength fluctuation effects on top of mean-field solutions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we derive the anomalous Ward identities descending from a gauge symmetry that gets globally broken in a fermionic system. We consider three different systems: the superconductor, the antiferromagnet, and the spiral magnet. In Sec. III, we present an explicit and detailed evaluation of the Ward identities for a spiral magnet and derive approximate expressions for the spin stiffnesses and dynamical susceptibilities. A conclusion in Sec. IV closes the presentation."

According to Elitzur\u2019s theorem [49], the breaking of the U(1) gauge symmetry is not possible, leading to the interpretation of the superconductor as a topologically ordered state [50] due to a subtle interplay of the dynamical gauge field and the order parameter [51]. In this paper, we treat the gauge field as a classical external perturbation and measure the system\u2019s\nresponse to it, so a discussion on the topological nature of the order is not required.\nWe consider the generating functional of susceptibilities of the superconducting order parameter and gauge kernels, defined as\nG[A\u03bc, J, J\u2217]\n= \u2212 ln \u222b D\u03c8D\u03c8e\u2212S[\u03c8,\u03c8,A\u03bc]+(J\u2217,\u03c8\u2193\u03c8\u2191 )+(J,\u03c8\u2191\u03c8\u2193 ), (1)\nwhere \u03c8 = (\u03c8\u2191, \u03c8\u2193) [\u03c8 = (\u03c8\u2191, \u03c8\u2193)] are Grassmann spinor fields corresponding to the annihilation (creation) of a fermion, A\u03bc is the electromagnetic field, J (J\u2217) is a source field that couples to the superconducting order parameter \u03c8\u2191\u03c8\u2193 (\u03c8\u2193\u03c8\u2191), and S[\u03c8,\u03c8, A\u03bc] is the action of the system. The index \u03bc = 0, 1, . . . , d , with d the system dimensionality, runs over temporal (\u03bc = 0) and spatial (\u03bc = 1, . . . , d) components. In the above equation and from now on, the expression (A, B) has to be intended as \u222b x A(x)B(x), where x is a collective variable consisting of a spatial coordinate x (possibly discrete, for lattice systems), and an imaginary time coordinate \u03c4 , and \u222b x is shorthand for \u222b dd x \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c4 , with \u03b2 the inverse temperature. Even in the case of a lattice system, we define the gauge field over a continuous space time, so that expressions involving its gradients are well-defined.\nWe let the global U(1) charge symmetry be broken by an order parameter that, to make the treatment simpler, we assume to be local (s wave),\n\u3008\u03c8\u2193(x)\u03c8\u2191(x)\u3009 = \u3008\u03c8\u2191(x)\u03c8\u2193(x)\u3009 = \u03d50, (2) where the average is computed at zero source and gauge fields, and, without loss of generality, we choose \u03d50 \u2208 R. A generalization to systems with nonlocal order parameters, such as d-wave superconductors, is straightforward.\nThe functional in Eq. (1) has been defined such that its second derivative with respect to J and J\u2217 at zero J , J\u2217, and A\u03bc gives (minus) the susceptibility of the order parameter \u03c7 (x, x\u2032), while (minus) the gauge kernel K\u03bc\u03bd (x, x\u2032) can be extracted by differentiating twice with respect to the gauge field. In formulas:\n\u03c7 (x, x\u2032) = \u2212 \u03b4 2G\n\u03b4J (x)\u03b4J\u2217(x\u2032) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 J=J\u2217=A\u03bc=0 , (3a)\nK\u03bc\u03bd (x, x \u2032) = \u2212 \u03b4 2G \u03b4A\u03bc(x)\u03b4A\u03bd (x\u2032) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 J=J\u2217=A\u03bc=0 .

In Eqs.

To keep the notation lighter, we always indicate the space-time coordinate as x, keeping in mind that its spatial component could have a different meaning, depending on the field it refers to.\nFor G to be invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation, it must not depend on \u03b8 (x):\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\u03b8 (x) G[A\u2032\u03bc, J \u2032, (J \u2032)\u2217] = 0.

The gauge kernel can be computed from as well,\nK\u03bc\u03bd (x, x \u2032) = \u2212 \u03b4\n2\n\u03b4A\u03bc(x)\u03b4A\u03bd (x\u2032) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c6=A\u03bc=0, (10) because, thanks to the Legendre transform properties, \u03b4 /\u03b4A\u03bc(x) = \u03b4G/\u03b4A\u03bc(x). Differently, differentiating twice with respect to the fields \u03c6a returns the inverse correlator\nCab(x, x\u2032) = \u2212 \u03b4 2\n\u03b4\u03c6a(x)\u03b4\u03c6b(x\u2032) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c6=A\u03bc=0, (11) which obeys a reciprocity relation [52]\u222b\nx\u2032\u2032 Cac(x, x\u2032\u2032)\u03c7 cb(x\u2032\u2032, x\u2032) = \u03b4ab\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032), (12)\nwith the generalized susceptibility \u03c7ab(x, x\u2032), defined as\n\u03c7ab(x, x\u2032) = \u2212 \u03b4 2G\n\u03b4Ja(x)\u03b4Jb(x\u2032) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Ja=A\u03bc=0 .

(14)\nEquation (14) is an identity for the generating functional stemming from U(1) gauge invariance of the theory. Taking derivatives with respect to the fields, one can derive an infinite set of Ward identities.\nWe are interested in the relation between the gauge kernel and the transverse inverse susceptibility C22(x, x\u2032). For this\npurpose, we differentiate Eq. (14) once with respect to \u03c62(x\u2032) and once with respect to A\u03bd (x\u2032), and then set the fields to zero. We obtain the set of equations\n\u2212\u2202\u03bcC2\u03bc(x, x\u2032) = 2\u03d50 C22(x, x\u2032), (15a) \u2212\u2202\u03bcK\u03bc\u03bd (x, x\u2032) = 2\u03d50 C2\u03bd (x, x\u2032), (15b)\nwhere \u03d50 = \u3008\u03c6(x)\u3009 = \u3008\u03c61(x)\u3009 = \u3008\u03c8\u2193(x)\u03c8\u2191(x)\u3009, and we have defined the quantity\nCa\u03bc(x, x\u2032) = \u2212 \u03b42\n\u03b4A\u03bc(x)\u03b4\u03c6a(x\u2032) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c6=A\u03bc=0. (16) Combining Eqs. (15a) and (15b), we obtain\n\u2202\u03bc\u2202\u03bdK\u03bc\u03bd (x, x \u2032) = 4\u03d520 C22(x, x\u2032). (17)\nFourier transforming Eq. (17) and rotating to real frequencies, we have\n\u2212q\u03bcq\u03bdK\u03bc\u03bd (q) = 4\u03d520C22(q), (18) with q = (q, \u03c9) a collective variable combining momentum and real frequency.\nWe now define the superfluid stiffness J\u03b1\u03b2 and the uniform density-density susceptibility \u03c7n [53] as\nJ\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2212 lim q\u21920 K\u03b1\u03b2 (q, \u03c9 = 0), (19a) \u03c7n \u2261 lim\n\u03c9\u21920 K00(q = 0, \u03c9), (19b)\nwhere the minus sign in Eq. (19a) has been introduced so that J\u03b1\u03b2 is positive definite. Notice that, even though the limits q \u2192 0 and \u03c9 \u2192 0 in Eq. (19b) have been taken in the opposite order compared to what is conventionally done, they commute in an s-wave superconductor because of the absence of gapless fermionic excitations. In the above equation and from now on, we employ the convention that the indices labeled as \u03bc, \u03bd include temporal and spatial components, whereas \u03b1 and \u03b2 only the latter. Taking the second derivative with respect to q on both sides of Eq. (18), we obtain\nJ\u03b1\u03b2 = 2\u03d520\u22022q\u03b1q\u03b2C22(q, \u03c9 = 0) \u2223\u2223 q\u21920, (20a)\n\u03c7n = \u22122\u03d520\u22022\u03c9C22(q = 0, \u03c9) \u2223\u2223 \u03c9\u21920, (20b)\nwhere \u22022q\u03b1q\u03b2 and \u2202 2 \u03c9 are shorthand for\n\u22022\n\u2202q\u03b1q\u03b2 and \u2202\n2\n\u2202\u03c92 , respec-\ntively. Moreover, we have made use of the Goldstone theorem, reading C22(0, 0) = 0. To derive Eq. (20) from Eq. (18), we have exploited the finiteness of the gauge kernel K\u03bc\u03bd (q) in the q \u2192 0 and \u03c9 \u2192 0 limits. Equations (20) state that the superfluid stiffness and the uniform density-density correlation function are not only the zero momentum and frequency limit of the gauge kernel but also the coefficients of the inverse transverse susceptibility when expanded for small q and \u03c9, respectively. Inverting Eq. (12), C22(q) can be expressed in terms of \u03c7ab(q) as\nC22(q) = 1 \u03c722(q) \u2212 \u03c721(q) 1\n\u03c711(q)\u03c7 12(q)\n. (21)\nIn the limit q \u2192 0 = (0, 0), \u03c722(q) diverges for the Goldstone theorem, while the second term in the denominator vanishes\n155105-3\nlike some power of q. This implies that, for small q,\nC22(q) 1 \u03c722(q) . (22)\nFrom this consideration, together with Eqs. (20), we can deduce that the transverse susceptibility can be written as\n\u03c722(q, \u03c9) 4\u03d5 2 0\n\u2212\u03c7n\u03c92 + J\u03b1\u03b2q\u03b1q\u03b2 , (23)\nfor small q and \u03c9. The above form of the \u03c722(q) can be also deduced from a low-energy theory for the phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter. Setting J and J\u2217 to zero in Eq. (1), and integrating out the Grassmann fields, one obtains an effective action for the gauge fields. The quadratic contribution in A\u03bc is\nS (2)eff [A\u03bc] = \u2212 1\n2 \u222b q K\u03bc\u03bd (q)A\u03bc(\u2212q)A\u03bd (q), (24)\nwhere \u222b q is shorthand for \u222b d\u03c9 2\u03c0 \u222b dd q (2\u03c0 )d . Since we are focusing only on slow and long-wavelength fluctuations of A\u03bc, we replace K\u03bc\u03bd (q) with K\u03bc\u03bd (0). Considering a pure gauge field, A\u03bc(x) = \u2212\u2202\u03bc\u03b8 (x), where \u03b8 (x) is (half) the phase of the superconducting order parameter (\u03c6(x) = \u03d50e\u22122i\u03b8 (x)), we obtain\nSeff [\u03b8 ] = 1 2 \u222b x {\u2212\u03c7n[\u2202t\u03b8 (x)]2 + J\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\u03b1\u03b8 (x)\u2202\u03b2\u03b8 (x)}, (25) with \u03b8 (x) \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0 ] a periodic field. The above action is wellknown to display a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition [54,55] for d = 1 (at T = 0) and d = 2 (at T > 0), while for d = 3 (T 0) or d = 2 (T = 0), it describes a gapless phase mode known as Anderson-Bogoliubov phonon [19].\nFrom Eq. (25), we can extract the propagator of the field \u03b8 (x),\n\u3008\u03b8 (\u2212q)\u03b8 (q)\u3009 = 1\u2212\u03c7n\u03c92 + J\u03b1\u03b2q\u03b1q\u03b2 , (26)\nwhere we have neglected the fact that \u03b8 (x) is defined modulo 2\u03c0 . Writing \u03c62(x) = (\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c6\u2217(x))/(2i) = \u2212\u03d50 sin(2\u03b8 (x)) \u22122\u03d50\u03b8 (x), \u03c722(q) can be expressed as\n\u03c722(q) =\u3008\u03c62(\u2212q)\u03c62(q)\u3009 4\u03d520\u3008\u03b8 (\u2212q)\u03b8 (q)\u3009\n= 4\u03d5 2 0\n\u2212\u03c7n\u03c92 + J\u03b1\u03b2q\u03b1q\u03b2 , (27)\nwhich is in agreement with Eq. (23)."

In the following, without loss of generality, we consider v\u0302 = (1, 0, 0). Considering only the diagonal (a = b) components of Eq.

(41c)\nDespite N\u00e9el antiferromagnetism breaking the lattice translational symmetry, the components of the gauge kernel considered above depend only on the difference of their arguments x \u2212 x\u2032, and thus have a well-defined Fourier transform. Equation (41a) implies q\u03bcq\u03bdK \u03bc\u03bd 11 (q, \u03c9) = 0, as expected due to the residual U(1) gauge invariance in the N\u00e9el state.

Equation (47) is the well-known O(3)/O(2) nonlinear sigma model (NL\u03c3M) action, describing low-energy properties of quantum antiferromagnets [25,59].\nWriting R(x) = ei\u03b8a (x) \u03c3a2 , and expanding to first order in \u03b8a(x), n\u0302(x) becomes n\u0302(x) (1, \u03b82(x),\u2212\u03b83(x)). Considering the expression \u03c6(x) = (\u22121)x\u03d50n\u0302(x) for the order parameter field, we see that small fluctuations in n\u0302(x) only affect the second and third components of \u03c6(x). The transverse susceptibilities can be therefore written as\n\u03c722(q) = \u03c733(q) = \u3008\u03c62(q)\u03c62(\u2212q)\u3009 \u03d520\u3008n2(q + Q)n2(\u2212q \u2212 Q)\u3009\n= \u03d5 2 0\n\u2212\u03c7\u22a5dyn\u03c92 + J\u03b1\u03b2 (q \u2212 Q)\u03b1 (q \u2212 Q)\u03b2 , (48)\nwhich is the result of Eq. (44). In Eq. (48), we have made use of the propagator of the n\u0302 field dictated by the action of\n155105-5\nEq. (47), that is,\n\u3008na(q)na(\u2212q)\u3009 = 1\u2212\u03c7\u22a5dyn\u03c92 + J\u03b1\u03b2q\u03b1q\u03b2 . (49)\nEquation (48) predicts two degenerate magnon branches with linear dispersion for small q \u2212 Q. In the case of an isotropic antiferromagnet (J\u03b1\u03b2 = J\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ), we have \u03c9q = cs|q|, with the spin-wave velocity given by cs = \u221a J/\u03c7\u22a5dyn."

In this case, it is convenient to rotate the field \u03c6(x) to a basis in which v\u0302(x) is uniform. This is achieved by the transformation [30]\n\u03c6\u2032(x) = M(x) \u03c6(x), (51) with\nM(x) = \u239b \u239d cos(Q \u00b7 x) sin(Q \u00b7 x) 0\u2212 sin(Q \u00b7 x) cos(Q \u00b7 x) 0\n0 0 1\n\u239e \u23a0.

(55b)\nWe remark that an order parameter of the type Eq. (50) completely breaks the SU(2) spin symmetry, which is why none of the right-hand sides of the equations above vanishes. We have considered a coplanar spiral magnetic order, that is, we have assumed all the spins to lie in the same plane, so out of the three Goldstone modes, two are degenerate and correspond to out-of-plane fluctuations, and one to in-plane fluctuations of the spins. Furthermore, translational invariance is broken, so the Fourier transforms of the gauge kernels Kab\u03bc\u03bd (q, q \u2032, \u03c9)\nand inverse susceptibilities Cab(q, q\u2032, \u03c9) are nonzero not only for q \u2212 q\u2032 = 0 but also for q \u2212 q\u2032 = \u00b1Q or \u00b12Q. Time translation invariance is preserved, and the gauge kernels and the inverse susceptibilities depend on one single frequency. However, in the basis obtained with transformation Eq. (52), translational invariance is restored, so the Fourier transform of C\u0303ab(x, x\u2032) only depends on one spatial momentum. With this in mind, we can extract expressions for the spin stiffnesses and dynamical susceptibilities from Eq. (54). After rotating to real frequencies, and using the property that for a spiral magnet the gauge kernels are finite in the limits q = q\u2032 \u2192 0 and \u03c9 \u2192 0, we obtain [53]\nJ\u22a5,1\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2212 limq\u21920 K 11 \u03b1\u03b2 (q, 0)\n= 1 8 \u03d520\u2202 2 q\u03b1q\u03b2 \u2211 \u03b7=\u00b1 C\u030333(q + \u03b7Q, 0) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 q\u21920 , (56a)\nJ\u22a5,2\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2212 limq\u21920 K 22 \u03b1\u03b2 (q, 0)\n= 1 8 \u03d520\u2202 2 q\u03b1q\u03b2 \u2211 \u03b7=\u00b1 C\u030333(q + \u03b7Q, 0) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 q\u21920 , (56b)\nJ \u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2212 limq\u21920 K 33 \u03b1\u03b2 (q, 0)\n= 1 2 \u03d520\u2202 2 q\u03b1q\u03b2C\u0303 22(q, 0) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 q\u21920 , (56c)\nand\n\u03c7\u22a5,1dyn \u2261 lim \u03c9\u21920 K1100 (0, \u03c9)\n= \u22121 8 \u03d520\u2202 2 \u03c9 \u2211 \u03b7=\u00b1 C\u030333(\u03b7Q, \u03c9) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c9\u21920 , (57a)\n\u03c7\u22a5,2dyn \u2261 lim \u03c9\u21920 K2200 (0, \u03c9)\n= \u22121 8 \u03d520\u2202 2 \u03c9 \u2211 \u03b7=\u00b1 C\u030333(\u03b7Q, \u03c9) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c9\u21920 , (57b)\n\u03c7 dyn \u2261 lim \u03c9\u21920 K3300 (0, \u03c9)\n= \u22121 2 \u03d520\u2202 2 \u03c9C\u0303 22(0, \u03c9) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c9\u21920 , (57c)\nwhere the labels \u22a5 and denote out-of-plane and in-plane quantities, respectively. In the equations above, we have defined Kab\u03bc\u03bd (q, \u03c9) as the prefactors of the components of the gauge kernels Kab\u03bc\u03bd (q, q\n\u2032, \u03c9) which are proportional to (2\u03c0 )d\u03b4(q \u2212 q\u2032). From Eqs. (56) and (57), it immediately follows that J\u22a5,1\u03b1\u03b2 = J\u22a5,2\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 J\u22a5\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03c7\u22a5,1dyn = \u03c7\u22a5,2dyn \u2261 \u03c7\u22a5dyn, as expected in the case of coplanar order [41]. To derive the equations above, we have made use of the Goldstone theorem, which for spiral ordering reads (see, for example, Refs. [30,34])\nC\u030333(\u00b1Q, 0) = 0, (58a) C\u030322(0, 0) = 0. (58b)\nNotice that the above relations can be also derived from a functional identity similar to Eq. (35) but descending from\n155105-6\nthe global SU(2) symmetry. Moreover, close to their respective Goldstone points [(0, 0) for C\u030322, and (\u00b1Q, 0) for C\u030333], C\u030322(q) can be replaced with 1/\u03c7\u030322(q), and C\u030333(q) with 1/\u03c7\u030333(q), with the rotated susceptibilities defined analogously to Eq. (53). If the spin spiral state occurs on a lattice that preserves parity, we have C\u0303aa(q, \u03c9) = C\u0303aa(\u2212q, \u03c9), from which we obtain\nJ\u22a5\u03b1\u03b2 = 1\n4 \u03d520\u2202 2 q\u03b1q\u03b2\n( 1\n\u03c7\u030333(q, 0) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 q\u2192\u00b1Q , (59a)\nJ \u03b1\u03b2 = 1\n2 \u03d520\u2202 2 q\u03b1q\u03b2\n( 1\n\u03c7\u030322(q, 0) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 q\u21920 , (59b)\n\u03c7\u22a5dyn = \u2212 1\n4 \u03d520\u2202 2 \u03c9\n( 1 \u03c7\u030333(\u00b1Q, \u03c9) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c9\u21920 , (59c)\n\u03c7 dyn = \u2212 1\n2 \u03d520\u2202 2 \u03c9\n( 1\n\u03c7\u030322(0, \u03c9) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c9\u21920 . (59d)\nNeglecting the imaginary parts of the susceptibilities, giving rise to dampings of the Goldstone modes [58], from Eqs. (59) we can obtain expressions for the susceptibilities near their Goldstone points:\n\u03c7\u030322(q (0, 0)) \u03d5 2 0\n\u2212\u03c7 dyn\u03c92 + J \u03b1\u03b2q\u03b1q\u03b2 , (60a)\n\u03c7\u030333(q (\u00b1Q, 0)) \u03d5 2 0/2\n\u2212\u03c7\u22a5dyn\u03c92 + J\u22a5\u03b1\u03b2 (q \u2213 Q)\u03b1 (q \u2213 Q)\u03b2 .\n(60b)\nExpressions Eqs. (60) can be deduced from a low-energy model also in the case of spin spiral ordering. Similarly to what we have done for the N\u00e9el case, we consider a pure gauge field, giving the nonlinear sigma model action\nSeff [R] = 1 2 \u222b x tr[P\u03bc\u03bd\u2202\u03bcR(x)\u2202\u03bdRT (x)], (61)\nwhere R(x) \u2208 SO(3) is defined as in Eq. (33), and now \u2202\u03bc denotes (\u2212\u2202t , \u2207 ). The matrix P\u03bc\u03bd is given by\nP\u03bc\u03bd = \u239b \u239d 12 J \u03bc\u03bd 0 00 12 J \u03bc\u03bd 0\n0 0 J\u22a5\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 12 J \u03bc\u03bd\n\u239e \u23a0, (62)\nwith\nJa\u03bc\u03bd = ( \u2212\u03c7adyn 0\n0 Ja\u03b1\u03b2\n) , (63)\nfor a \u2208 { ,\u22a5}. The action in Eq. (61) is a NL\u03c3M describing low-energy fluctuations around a spiral magnetic ordered state. It has been introduced and studied in the context of frustrated antiferromagnets [41\u201344].\nWe now write the field \u03c6\u2032(x) as \u03c6\u2032(x) = \u03d50M(x)R(x)v\u0302(x), and consider an R(x) stemming from a SU(2) matrix R(x) = ei\u03b8a (x) \u03c3a\n2 with \u03b8a(x) infinitesimal, that is,\nRab(x) \u03b4ab \u2212 \u03b5abc\u03b8c(x), (64)\nwe get\n\u03c6\u2032(x) \u03d50M(x)[v\u0302(x) \u2212 v\u0302(x) \u00d7 \u03b8 (x)] = \u03d50[e\u03021 \u2212 e\u03021 \u00d7 \u03b8 \u2032(x)], (65)\nwith e\u03021 = (1, 0, 0), and \u03b8 \u2032(x) = M(x) \u03b8 (x). Inserting Eq. (64) into Eq. (61), we obtain\nSeff [ \u03b8] = 1 2 \u222b x { J\u22a5\u03bc\u03bd \u2211 a=1,2 [\u2202\u03bc\u03b8a(x)\u2202\u03bd\u03b8a(x)]\n+ J \u03bc\u03bd\u2202\u03bc\u03b83(x)\u2202\u03bd\u03b83(x) } . (66)\nWe are finally in a position to extract the form of the susceptibilities for small fluctuations,\n\u03c7\u030322(q) = \u3008\u03c6\u20322(q)\u03c6\u20322(\u2212q)\u3009 \u03d520\u3008\u03b8 \u20323(q)\u03b8 \u20323(\u2212q)\u3009\n= \u03d5 2 0\n\u2212\u03c7 dyn\u03c92 + J \u03b1\u03b2q\u03b1q\u03b2 ,\n(67a)\n\u03c7\u030333(q) = \u3008\u03c6\u20323(q)\u03c6\u20323(\u2212q)\u3009 \u03d520\u3008\u03b8 \u20322(q)\u03b8 \u20322(\u2212q)\u3009\n= \u2211 \u03b7=\u00b1\n\u03d520/2\n\u2212\u03c7\u22a5dyn\u03c92 + J\u22a5\u03b1\u03b2 (q \u2212 \u03b7Q)\u03b1 (q \u2212 \u03b7Q)\u03b2 , (67b)\nwhich is the result of Eqs. (60). In the above equations, we have used the correlators of the \u03b8 field descending from action Eq. (66). Form Eqs. (60) of the susceptibilities predicts three linearly dispersing Goldstone modes, two of which (the outof-plane ones) are degenerate and propagate with velocities\nc(n)\u22a5 = \u221a \u03bb (n) \u22a5 /\u03c7 \u22a5 dyn, where \u03bb (n) \u22a5 are the eigenvalues of J \u22a5 \u03b1\u03b2 and n = 1, . . . , d . Similarly, the in-plane mode velocity is given by c(n) = \u221a \u03bb (n) /\u03c7 dyn , with \u03bb (n) the eigenvalues of J\n\u03b1\u03b2 ."

[30].\nThe charge and spin susceptibilities are coupled in a spin spiral state. It is therefore convenient to consider the retarded real-time correlators [58]\n\u03c7abj j\u2032 (t ) = \u2212i (t ) \u2329[ Saj (t ), S b j\u2032 (0) ]\u232a , (77)\nwhere j and j\u2032 label two lattice sites, t is the time, [\u2022, \u2022] denotes the commutator, (t ) is the Heaviside function, and a and b run from 0 to 3. The generalized spin operators are defined in terms of the fermionic fields as\nSaj = 1\n2 \u2211 s,s\u2032=\u2191,\u2193 \u03c8 j,s\u03c3 a ss\u2032\u03c8 j,s\u2032 . (78)\nThe a = 1, 2, 3 components correspond to the usual spin operator, while a = 0 gives half the fermion density nj = \u03c8 j,\u2191\u03c8 j,\u2191 + \u03c8 j,\u2193\u03c8 j,\u2193.\nIt is convenient to work in the rotated basis [30] introduced in Eqs. (51) and (52) the susceptibilities transform as\n\u03c7\u0303 j j\u2032 (t ) = M j\u03c7 j j\u2032 (t )MTj\u2032 , (79) with\nM j = \u239b \u239c\u239d\n1 0 0 0 0 cos(Q \u00b7 r j ) sin(Q \u00b7 r j ) 0 0 \u2212 sin(Q \u00b7 r j ) cos(Q \u00b7 r j ) 0 0 0 0 1\n\u239e \u239f\u23a0, (80)\nwhere r j represents the coordinates of the lattice site j. As previously mentioned, the \u03c7\u0303 j j \u2032 (t ) are translationally invariant, so their Fourier transform depends only on a single spatial momentum q.\nWithin RPA, the susceptibilities are given by\n\u03c7\u0303 (q) = \u03c7\u03030(q)[1 \u2212 0\u03c7\u03030(q)]\u22121, (81) where \u03c7\u03030(q) is a matrix in the a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3 indices, 1 is the 4 \u00d7 4 identity matrix, and 0 = 2Udiag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1). The bare susceptibilities on the real frequency axis are given by\n\u03c7\u0303ab0 (q, \u03c9)\n= \u22121 4 \u222b k T \u2211 \u03bdn tr[\u03c3 a G\u0303k(i\u03bdn) \u03c3 b G\u0303k+q(i\u03bdn + i m)],\n(82)\nwhere m = 2m\u03c0T (m \u2208 Z) denotes a bosonic Matsubara frequency and the substitution i m \u2192 \u03c9 + i0+ has been performed. Using Eq. (72), one can perform the frequency sum, obtaining\n\u03c7\u0303ab0 (q, \u03c9) = \u2212 1\n8 \u2211 , \u2032=\u00b1 \u222b k Aab \u2032 (k, q)F \u2032 (k, q, \u03c9), (83)\nwhere we have defined F \u2032 (k, q, \u03c9) = P f ( E k ) \u2212 f (E \u2032k+q) \u03c9 + E k \u2212 E \u2032k+q , (84)\nwith P the principal value, and the coherence factors\nAab \u2032 (k, q) = 12 Tr [ \u03c3 au k\u03c3 bu \u2032 k+q ] . (85)\nNotice that in Eq. (84) we have neglected the imaginary part of 1/(\u03c9 + i0+ + E k \u2212 E \u2032 k+q), which is proportional to a \u03b4 function and is responsible for the Landau damping of the collective spin fluctuations [58].\n155105-8\nThe bare susceptibilities have a well-defined sign under inversion of q and \u03c9, and under the exchange of the indices a and b. These symmetries can be derived from Eqs. (83)\u2013(85) (see, for example, Ref. [58]) and are listed in Table I. Since neglecting the imaginary part of F \u2032 (k, q, \u03c9) makes the matrix \u03c7\u0303ab0 (q) Hermitian, we deduce that those elements which are even (odd) under the exchange a \u2194 b are purely real (imaginary). At least within the RPA, the symmetry properties derived for the bare \u03c7\u03030(q) hold also for the full susceptibilities \u03c7\u0303 (q).\nGoldstone modes associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking of the SU(2) spin symmetry appear in the susceptibilities. In particular, considering the limit q \u2192 0, all the off-diagonal elements of the type \u03c7\u03032a0 (q) and \u03c7\u0303 a2 0 (q) vanish as they are odd in q or \u03c9, while \u03c7\u0303220 (q) takes the simple form\n\u03c7\u0303220 (0) = \u222b\nk f (E\u2212k ) \u2212 f (E+k ) 4ek . (86)\nThe full susceptibility at q = 0 therefore reads\n\u03c7\u030322(0) = \u03c7\u0303 22 0 (0)\n1 \u2212 2U \u03c7\u0303220 (0) . (87)\nWe immediately see that when the gap Eq. (75) is fulfilled, the denominator of Eq. (87) vanishes, signaling a gapless mode. This Goldstone mode represents fluctuations of the spins within the plane in which the magnetization lies. We therefore refer to it as in-plane mode in the following. With a similar reasoning, one proves that in the limit q \u2192 \u00b1Q (with Q = (Q, 0)), all the off-diagonal elements of types \u03c7\u03033a0 (q) and \u03c7\u0303a30 (q) vanish, leaving\n\u03c7\u030333(\u00b1Q) = \u03c7\u0303 33 0 (\u00b1Q)\n1 \u2212 2U \u03c7\u0303330 (\u00b1Q) . (88)\nNoticing that \u03c7\u0303330 (\u00b1Q) = \u03c7\u0303220 (0) [58], one sees that the denominator of Eq. (88) is vanishing. The susceptibility \u03c7\u030333(q) therefore hosts two poles at q = \u00b1Q, which are due to gapless excitations of the spins outside the plane in which the magnetization lies. We refer to these modes as out-of-plane modes. As already stated, in the spiral state three Goldstone modes appear, as all three generators of the symmetry group SU(2) are broken. However, the two out-of-plane modes have degenerate dispersions, as expected for coplanar order."

For later convenience, we note that for q = 0, all the off-diagonal elements \u03c7\u03032a0 (q) and \u03c7\u0303 a2 0 (q) vanish, so \u03032(0) can be obtained from the full expression\n\u0303(q) = [1 \u2212 0\u03c7\u03030(q)]\u22121 0, (92) selecting only the components in which the indices take the values 0, 1, or 3.\nSetting \u03c9 = 0, the bare susceptibilities \u03c7\u0303230 (q) and \u03c7\u0303320 (q) vanish as they are odd in \u03c9.

As noticed in Ref.

Since J = 0 and \u03c7\u22a5dyn = 0 in the symmetric phase due to SU(2) gauge invariance, the expression cs = \u221a J/\u03c7\u22a5dyn yields a finite value cs at the critical point \u2192 0, provided that J and \u03c7\u22a5dyn scale to zero with the same power of , as happens within mean-field theory. Note that in the symmetric phase, SU(2) gauge invariance does not pose any constraint on \u03c7\u22a5, which is generally finite.\nIn the simpler case of perfect nesting, that is, when \u03bek = \u2212\u03bek+Q, corresponding to the half-filled particle-hole symmetric Hubbard model, and at zero temperature, expressions for J and \u03c7\u22a5 have been derived in Refs. [21,48] for two spatial dimensions, and it is straightforward to check that our results reduce to these in this limit. Moreover, Eqs. (31)\u2013(34) in Ref. [21] are similar to our Ward identities but no derivation is provided."

            "text": "In conclusion, we have derived Ward identities for fermionic systems in which a gauge symmetry is globally broken. In particular, we have shown that the zero-energy and long-wavelength components of the gauge kernels are connected to the transverse susceptibilities of the order parameter by exact relations. We have analyzed several examples, namely, a superconductor, a N\u00e9el antiferromagnet, and a spiral magnet. In the latter case, we have performed an explicit calculation of the transverse susceptibilities and of the gauge kernels within the RPA and verified that the Ward identities are indeed fulfilled. Furthermore, we have considered the\nN\u00e9el limit Q \u2192 (\u03c0/a0, . . . , \u03c0/a0) and found that our RPA expressions for the spin stiffnesses and susceptibilities reduce to those previously obtained in Refs. [21,48]. We have also shown that the hydrodynamic expression for the magnon velocity cs = \u221a J/\u03c7\u22a5 does not hold in the presence of gapless\nfermionic excitations and must be replaced by cs = \u221a J/\u03c7\u22a5dyn. While \u03c7\u22a5 is computed by taking the \u03c9 \u2192 0 limit before letting q \u2192 0 in the transverse susceptibility, \u03c7\u22a5dyn is obtained reversing the order of the limits. The equality \u03c7\u22a5dyn = \u03c7\u22a5 holds only for insulating antiferromagnets at low temperatures T , as is the case for the spin systems considered in Refs. [23,24].\nOur findings find immediate application in the study of large distance properties of interacting fermion systems. In fact, via a microscopic calculation, one can evaluate the coefficients of the effective actions listed in Sec. II and study phenomena which are purely fluctuation driven. Examples are the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in two-dimensional superconductors (see, for example, the microscopic calculation of Ref. [61]) or strong magnetic fluctuations leading to the formation of a pseudogap in lowdimensional electron systems [48,62]. Special care, however, must be taken when the fermions form Fermi surfaces, as the low-energy modes of the order parameter can decay in particle-hole pairs, producing a Landau damping [58] that can affect the macroscopic and critical properties of the system [26,63]. An interesting extension of the present paper would be to derive Ward identities for the damping of the Goldstone modes."

Metzner for encouraging me to write this paper, enlightening discussions, and a careful and critical reading of the paper.\nAPPENDIX A: EXPRESSIONS FOR \u03ba30\u03b1 (0) AND \u03ba 31 \u03b1 (0)\nIn this Appendix, we report explicit expressions for the off-diagonal paramagnetic contributions to the spin stiffness, namely, \u03ba30\u03b1 (0), and \u03ba 31 \u03b1 (0).\nFor \u03ba30\u03b1 (0), we have, after making the trace in Eq. (105) explicit,\n\u03ba30\u03b1 (0) = limq\u21920 K 31 para,\u03b10(q, q \u2032, 0) = \u2212 1 4 \u222b k T \u2211 \u03bdn {[ G2k(i\u03bdn) + F 2k (i\u03bdn) ] \u03b3 \u03b1k \u2212 [ G 2 k(i\u03bdn) + F 2k (i\u03bdn) ] \u03b3 \u03b1k+Q } \u03b4q\u2032,0\n= \u2212 1 4 \u222b k T \u2211 \u03bdn { \u2202k[Gk \u2212 Gk] + 4F 2k \u2202k\u03b1 hk } \u03b4q\u2032,0, (A1)\nwhere we have made use of properties Eqs. (129) in the last line. The first term vanishes when integrated by parts, while the Matsubara summation for the second yields\n\u03ba30\u03b1 (0) = \u2212 2\n4 \u222b k [ f (E\u2212k ) \u2212 f (E+k ) e3k + f \u2032(E+k ) + f \u2032(E\u2212k ) e2k ] (\u2202k\u03b1 hk ). (A2)\nFor \u03ba31\u03b1 (0), we have\nlim q\u21920\nK31para,\u03b10(q, q \u2032, 0) = \u2212 1\n4 \u222b k T \u2211 \u03bdn [ Gk(i\u03bdn)Fk(i\u03bdn)\u03b3 \u03b1 k \u2212 Gk(i\u03bdn)Fk(i\u03bdn)\u03b3 \u03b1k+Q ] (\u03b4q\u2032,Q + \u03b4q\u2032,\u2212Q). (A3)\n155105-14\nDefining \u03ba31\u03b1 (0) = 2K31para,\u03b10(0, Q, 0) [see Eq. (111b)] and performing the Matsubara sum, we obtain\n\u03ba31\u03b1 (0) = \u2212 2\n4 \u222b k {[ hk ek (\u2202k\u03b1 gk ) + (\u2202k\u03b1 hk ) ] f \u2032(E+k ) ek + [ hk ek (\u2202k\u03b1 gk ) \u2212 (\u2202k\u03b1 hk ) ] f \u2032(E\u2212k ) ek + hk e2k (\u2202k\u03b1 gk ) f (E\u2212k ) \u2212 f (E+k ) ek } . (A4)\nFurthermore, it is easy to see that K31\u03b10 (0,\u00b1Q, 0) = \u2213iK32\u03b10 (0,\u00b1Q, 0), which, together with Eq. (111c), proves \u03ba31\u03b1 (0) = \u03ba\u03b132(0). We remark that in the N\u00e9el limit both \u03ba30\u03b1 (0) and \u03ba 31 \u03b1 (0) vanish as their integrands are odd under k \u2192 k + Q.\nAPPENDIX B: EXPRESSIONS FOR \u03c7\u0303\u2212a0 (Q)\nWe report here the RPA expressions for the off-diagonal bare susceptibilities \u03c7\u0303\u2212a0 (Q), with a = 0, 1, 2. They can all be obtained by computing the trace and the Matsubara summation in Eq. (82). We obtain\n\u03c7\u0303\u221200 (Q) = \u2212 1\n16 \u222b k \u2211 , \u2032=\u00b1 [ ek + \u2032 ek+Q + \u2032 (hk+Q \u2212 hk ) ekek+Q ] F \u2032 (k, Q, 0), (B1a)\n\u03c7\u0303\u221210 (Q) = \u2212 1\n16 \u222b k \u2211 , \u2032=\u00b1 [ 1 + hk ek \u2212 \u2032 hk+Q ek+Q \u2212 \u2032 hkhk+Q \u2212 2 ekek+Q ] F \u2032 (k, Q, 0), (B1b)\n\u03c7\u0303\u221220 (Q) = + i\n16 \u222b k \u2211 , \u2032=\u00b1 [ 1 + hk ek \u2212 \u2032 hk+Q ek+Q \u2212 \u2032 hkhk+Q + 2 ekek+Q ] F \u2032 (k, Q, 0).
