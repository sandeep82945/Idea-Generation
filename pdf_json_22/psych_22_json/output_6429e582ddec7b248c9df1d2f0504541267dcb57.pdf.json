    "abstractText": "Background: Music-based intervention has been used as first-line non-pharmacological treatment to improve cognitive function for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in clinical practice. However, evidence regarding the effect of music-based intervention on general cognitive function as well as subdomains of cognitive functions in these individuals is scarce. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of music-based interventions on a wide range of cognitive functions in people with MCI or dementia. Method: We searched the effect of various music therapies using randomized controlled trials on cognitive function using several databases. Studies based on any type of dementia or MCI were combined. The effects of music-based intervention on each cognitive function were pooled by meta-analysis. Results: A total of 19 studies involving n = 1024 participants (mean age ranged from 60 to 87 years old) were included. We found statistically significant improvements in MMSE (general cognitive function), the Frontal Assessment Battery (executive function), and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (episodic memory). Conclusions: This study provides positive evidence to support music-based interventions for improving a wide range of cognitive functions in older adults with MCI and dementia. Therefore, we recommend increased use of music in people\u2019s homes, day care centers and nursing homes. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number 250383.",

            "text": "The number of people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has rapidly increased in recent decades and related challenges have become a global burden [1]. Dementia and MCI are characterized by irreversible impairment of cognitive function, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and decrease in the activities of daily living (ADL) [2]. Decreased cognitive function is one of the main reasons why the lives of people with dementia become difficult [3]. In people with dementia and MCI, cognitive\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081462 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462 2 of 21\ndecline also negatively affects quality of life (QoL), ADL functioning, and communication with relatives and healthcare professionals [4]. Therefore, it is important for cognitive function to be improved in the daily lives of people with dementia and MCI. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention are two approaches for improving cognitive function. The latest pharmacological approaches indicate the beneficial effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease [5]. However, the costs and risks associated with utilizing pharmacological therapy have been an issue [5]. Additionally, antidepressants, sedatives, and anti-dementia drugs are commonly used as add-on therapies, but have shown negative impacts on QoL [6]. Due to fewer risks and adverse effects, a non-pharmacological approach using cognitive activities, physical exercise, and art and play therapies has been suggested as a first line treatment strategy for the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia [6]. Previous studies have shown that these intervention programs lead to improvements in cognitive function in people with dementia and MCI [7,8]. Thus, non-pharmacological approaches have attracted the attention of aging researchers and caregivers. Musical skill is a preserved skill in people with dementia [9,10]. Consequently, music-based intervention is a major strategy of the non-pharmacological intervention approach [11]. Music-based intervention is defined as any intervention using \u201cmusic\u201d (music as a cultural product usually involving some combination of melody, rhythm and harmony cognitively processed by the human brain) to study the therapeutic effect [11]. \u201cMusic\u201d is then differentiated from single pitch sound and sound (or aspects of music) transduced into vibrotactile sensation of neuromodulatory and physiological effects [12,13]. The review in this paper focuses exclusively on music-based interventions which were mainly categorized into music therapy by a trained music therapist and music medicine by healthcare or music professionals [11,14]. At the beginning, music therapy was defined as \u201can intentional use of properties and the potential of music and its impact on the human being\u201d [15]. Recently, the American Music Therapy Association has narrowed this definition to: \u201cMusic Therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program\u201d(https://www.musictherapy.org/about/musictherapy/, access date: 4 July 2022). It suggests that music therapy involves therapeutic relationships between participants and music therapists. On the other hand, music medicine does not need these relationships. Music has been widely used in clinical practice throughout history [16]. However, the results of studies on the effectiveness of music-based intervention lack consistency. Some meta analyses focusing on global cognitive function showed that music-based intervention had small to moderate effects on maintaining or improving cognitive function [17,18]. Other meta-analyses showed inconsistent results in that music-based intervention was found to have no effect on impairment [19]. Due to the small number of studies included in the previous meta-analyses and these inconsistent results [18\u201320], it is difficult to conclude whether music-based intervention would have positive effects on cognition in aging populations or not. It still needs to be investigated whether music-based intervention has the potential to improve cognitive function in people with dementia and MCI. Previous meta-analysis studies mainly focused on the benefits of music-based intervention for general cognitive function measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). However, prior evidence suggests that cognitive function has multiple subdomains [21]. In addition, each individual with dementia shows deterioration of cognitive function in a different way. In terms of the subdomains of cognitive function, some show specific deterioration of memory while others show decline in executive function [21]. Therefore, it is essential to investigate whether music-based intervention would have positive effects on each cognitive function subdomain. In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of music-based intervention on each subdomain of cognitive function in people with dementia and MCI.\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462 3 of 21"

In addition, we separately conducted meta-analyses on whether each cognitive domain included more than one study with MCI or dementia and music-based intervention by music therapist or not.

A higher score reflecting better cognitive function was represented by a positive effect estimate. A lower score reflecting poorer task performance was represented by a negative effect estimate. A random-effects model was chosen due to the expected heterogeneity between trial protocols.

In addition, music-based intervention improved executive functions in people with dementia (I2 = 16%, SMD = 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45).\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462 13 of 21\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462 14 of 21\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462 15 of 21"

            "text": "We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of musicbased intervention on each subdomain of cognitive function for people with dementia and MCI. We found that music-based intervention improved cognitive function assessed by the MMSE total score. Further, the intervention improved both the executive function and the episodic memory performance. These results are of key importance for patients, clinicians and stakeholders because these cognitive functions are associated with ADL and QoL in people with MCI and dementia [61\u201363]. The first main finding is that music-based intervention increased general cognitive function in people with dementia and MCI. This finding is in line with prior meta-analysis studies [17,18]. However, the results regarding the effects of music-based intervention are still controversial. Some meta-analysis studies have reported no positive effect of musical\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462 16 of 21\ntherapy on general cognitive function [19,20]. The reason for this dissociation is the number of included studies in past meta-analysis studies. For example, the number of included studies in the previous meta-analyses was eight [18], seven [19], and eight [20]. However, the current meta-analysis included 19 studies. Therefore, our meta-analysis provides more validated results. It is important to note that most of the previous studies ignored the differences between cognitive tests. For example, the MMSE and the MoCA are mainly used to measure general cognitive function, but the sub-components of each test are different [64]. The MMSE emphasizes orientation and language activities while the MoCA emphasizes executive function and visual task domains [65]. Supporting this difference between the MMSE and the MoCA, in this meta-analysis we found that music-based intervention significantly improved MMSE scores but not MoCA scores. This result indicates that it would be better to consider this difference and separately perform meta-analysis for each test. However, we found only two studies using the MoCA [42,59]. Thus, it will be necessary to perform further meta-analysis in the near future. Considering the types of interventions is important for an understanding of the beneficial effect of music-based intervention on cognitive function. Music-based intervention as a whole could conceptually be divided into receptive intervention type, which required the participants to listen to music, and active intervention type, which required the participants to play musical instruments, to sing songs, or to move with music. In this study, we found eight receptive interventions [41,45,47,48,50,52,56,58] and 11 active interventions [42\u201344,46,47,50,51,53,54,59]. Among the eight studies that measured MMSE scores [41,44,50,51,54\u201356,58], five studies involved receptive music activities [41,44,55,56,58] and three involved active music activities [50,51,54]. Of the eight studies, seven using the MMSE showed increases in MMSE performance [41,50,51,54\u201356,58]. These results indicate that any type of music-based intervention would have beneficial effects on general cognitive function. The second main finding is that we demonstrated the positive effect of music-based intervention on executive function. In addition, we found that music-based intervention led to improvements in FAB and Verbal Fluency Test scores. Considering the types of interventions, three studies used receptive music activities [41,47,58] and six studies used active music activities [42\u201344,46,50,51]. Of the six studies included, the four studies using active music activities reported significant improvements in the performance of executive function [42,46,50,51]. Moreover, all four studies that measured the FAB used active music activities [42,43,46,51]. This suggests that active music-based intervention would have positive effects on executive function. This may be because active music intervention is more likely to promote socialization, engagement, verbal processing, or motor planning compared with receptive music intervention [66]. Since active music intervention has been utilized more often than receptive music intervention, future studies should investigate the effect of active music-based intervention on cognitive function. The third and final main finding is that music-based intervention led to an improvement in episodic memory. In this meta-analysis, we included two studies [45,50], both of which used the AVLT as a measurement for episodic memory. The AVLT is an auditory verbal learning test using words [67]. The interventions asked the participants to sing and listen to their favorite songs, which were popular in their twenties and thirties, or listen to music and recall their experiences related to the music (reminiscence). The intervention required participants to understand the lyrics (semantic memory) and explicitly and implicitly recall past episodes (episodic memory) during music-based intervention. Therefore, this type of music-based intervention may facilitate episodic memory performance. Due to the small number of available studies, future studies are required that include other memory function measurements to clarify the effect of music-based intervention on episodic memory. It would be too early to conclude that music-based intervention is not effective in processing speed performance. In this meta-analysis we found only five studies that in-\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462 17 of 21\nvestigated processing speed [41,44,46,47,58]. In addition, typical music-based intervention does not require the cognitive process related to processing speed [68]. Future studies should include episodic memory or processing speed components during music-based intervention. It should be important to consider whether the intervention period of the included studies was sufficient to evaluate improvements in cognitive function. Previous systematic review and meta-analysis for non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive training, exercise, nutrition revealed that previous studies used the similar intervention periods (from 4 to 12 weeks) [25,69\u201372]. The short-term intervention was able to improve cognitive functions in older adults with and without dementia. This indicated that the intervention period among the included studies was sufficient time to investigate the improvements in cognitive functions. However, whether an intervention period would affect the beneficial effect of music-based intervention on cognitive function is an important consideration. Further studies should investigate effects of shorter- and longer-term music-based intervention. It is important to note results from supplementary meta-analyses based on MCI/dementia differences and the music-based intervention with the music therapist/the non-musictherapist (Please see Figure 3, Figure 6, and Figure 8). Music-based intervention improved general cognitive functions in both people with MCI and dementia. On the other hand, music-based intervention improved executive functions in people with dementia. Moreover, music-based intervention by the non-music therapist improved general cognitive functions and executive functions in people with MCI and dementia. However, we did not find any significant improvements from music-based intervention by the music therapist. There would be some consideration points. The main point is the small number of studies included for the supplementary analyses. We found only three studies with MCI and five studies with music therapists. The second point is the countries where the RCT was conducted. All studies with MCI were conducted in Japan. Looking at music-based intervention by a music therapist, four studies were conducted in Italy and one study was in USA. Therefore, we were unable to exclude the possibility of a cultural bias. In the future, there should be more studies to investigate whether benefits from music-based intervention would differ between people with MCI and dementia and between musicbased intervention by a music therapist or not. In the current meta-analysis, we did not include music-based interventions transduced into vibrotactile stimulation or single frequency sound. The music interventions we reviewed are those with sound perceived culturally as music and which we can naturally hear (20 Hz\u201320 kHz). Although vibrotactile aspects of sound and vibratory dimensions of music are frequently present as potentially therapeutic effects, they are less studied. A recent scoping review reported that vibration intervention had positive effects on cognitive functions [73]. In the future study, we should consider beneficial effects of music-based intervention using vibration on cognitive functions. This study has several limitations. First, clinical heterogeneity between studies, such as severity of dementia, could not be avoided. Second, although we separately analyzed the clinical cognitive function assessment scales, some of the outcome domains had only one study. Third, some of the included studies had a small sample size. Due to the small number of included studies and the wide variety of participant characteristics, we were unable to conduct a stratified analysis. Fourth, the placebo effect in music intervention studies should have been mentioned. Participants did not know the purpose of the music intervention because they were blinded in 15 of the 19 included studies (see Table 1). However, almost all studies used passive control groups. In this case, participants in the music intervention group would think that they receive a beneficial intervention/treatment. Therefore, a placebo effect might occur because they would expect that their cognitive function would be improved. To reduce the placebo effect, the future study should use an active control intervention group. Finally, we did not consider a kinesthetic and physical\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1462 18 of 21\naspect in the music-based intervention program. To exclude an effect of physical activity, in the future, we should compare similar physical activities groups with and without music."
