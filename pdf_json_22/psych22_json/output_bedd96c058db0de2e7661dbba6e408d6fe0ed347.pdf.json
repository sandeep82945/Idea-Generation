Traditionally, treatments for methamphetamine use have been delivered in\u2010person \u2013 however, lockdowns initiated during the COVID\u201019 pandemic significantly reduced access to such in\u2010person support in prisons. Therefore, in May 2020 a digital cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (CBT) program for substance use disorders \u2010 \u2019Breaking Free from Substance Abuse\u2019 \u2010 was made available across prisons in Ohio in order to meet this treatment gap. This represents the first time this digital CBT intervention has been made widely available to incarcerated people residing in prisons or jails in the United States (US). This was a within\u2010subjects study using data from 2187 Ohio prison residents who engaged with this digital CBT program to address their methamphetamine use. Results: Participants reported multiple psychosocial risk factors, including moderate to severe substance depend\u2010 ence, depression and anxiety; interpersonal conflict; aggressive behavior; paranoia; and difficulties with work, educa\u2010 tion and accommodation. Significant reductions in substance dependence, depression/anxiety and biopsychosocial impairment, and improvements in quality of life, were identified in the sample. Risk factors were associated with less positive outcomes, specifically interpersonal conflict and poor mental health. Completion of specific components of the program were associated with more positive outcomes \u2013 a dose response was also identified. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Health & Justice (2022) 10:28 Background During the COVID-19 pandemic in-person substance use disorder (SUD) treatment was limited, with many services moving to digital and telehealth delivery (Monaghesh & Hajizadeh 2020). However, delivering technology-mediated treatment in secure correctional settings is challenging \u2013 despite this, there have been examples of correctional services working innovatively to meet the needs of their populations during the pandemic. This study therefore reports data from prison residents across Ohio who accessed digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SUD during the pandemic. This study focuses on methamphetamine-involved residents given the links between use of the drug and involvement with correctional services. The links between methamphetamine use and involvement in correctional services Prevalence of methamphetamine use amongst people in the United States (US) in 2019 was 1.2 million for pastmonth use (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2020). Methamphetamine use is associated with an unstable lifestyle and psychosocial risk factors that are linked to involvement in correctional services (Cumming et al. 2020), including mental health disorders such as psychosis (Chiang et  al. 2019), homelessness (Jones et al. 2020), financial difficulties (McKetin et al. 2020) and interpersonal conflict (Maltman et  al. 2020). These factors may increase likelihood of both acquisitive (Goldsmid & Willis 2016) and violent crimes (Liu et al. 2017). Mental health and other psychosocial difficulties (e.g. homelessness), SUD and offending interact in multiple ways (Hamilton 2014). The \u201cself-medication\u201d hypothesis (Robinson et  al. 2011) suggests that some people use substances as a means of coping with their mental health difficulties, or conversely, substance use may directly cause, or exacerbate, pre-existing mental health difficulties (e.g. Boden & Fergusson 2011). Alternatively there may be some other common factor that increases vulnerability to mental health and substance use issues, such as chronic stress (Brady & Sinha 2005) or certain personality traits (Kotov et al. 2010). Substance use and mental health difficulties may start in late childhood and early adolescence (Deas & Brown 2006), often alongside significant childhood adversity (Johnson et al. 2006), with these difficulties then contributing to an increased risk of offending in adulthood (Wiesner et al. 2005). Psychosocial risk factors are found in models describing criminogenic risk factors, one of the most influential being the \u2018risk-need-responsivity\u2019 model (RNR: Andrews et  al. 2006). Risk factors identified within the model include family and/or marital issues, difficulties at school or work, leisure or recreation issues, and substance abuse, in addition to anti-social behaviours, cognitions, personality patterns, and associates. These risk factors provide targets for assessment and intervention in populations involved in correctional services \u2013 higher-risk offenders may experience greater reductions in recidivism from RNR-informed interventions compared to lower-risk offenders (Bonta & Andrews 2007). Treatment for methamphetamine use and the impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic Methamphetamine-involved offenders have unique treatment needs \u2013 use of the drug is often associated with cognitive impairments (Potvin et  al. 2018) and risk-taking and erratic behaviors (Homer et  al. 2008), and people who use the drug often experience complex mental health issues including psychosis (Cumming et al. 2020). In contrast with other substances associated with involvement with correctional services, e.g. opioids (Chen et  al. 2022) and alcohol (Akbar et  al. 2018), there are no accepted pharmacological treatments for methamphetamine use (Siefried et  al. 2020). The only existing treatments are psychosocial and behavioral \u2013 a systematic review demonstrated CBT and contingency management to be effective in reducing use of the drug (AshaRani et  al. 2020), and therapeutic communities have also been demonstrated to confer therapeutic benefits in correctional (Joe et al. 2010) and community settings (\u0160efr\u00e1nek & Miovsk\u00fd 2017). However, there may be barriers to accessing treatment for methamphetamine use, including financial costs and lack of available places in programs (Cumming et al. 2016). A significant barrier to accessing both community and correctional in-person SUD services since March 2020 has been the COVID-19 pandemic. Krebs and colleagues (2021) examined the impact of the pandemic on corrections agencies across Ohio \u2013 75% of respondents reported restrictions that impacted rehabilitative Conclusions: Digital CBT can be delivered in secure US correctional settings and may help to fill unmet needs for in\u2010person treatment. Specifically, this digital CBT program may support incarcerated individuals to address metham\u2010 phetamine use, with outcomes being associated with psychosocial risk factors and program engagement.",

However, delivering technology-mediated treatment in secure correctional settings is challenging \u2013 despite this, there have been examples of correctional services working innovatively to meet the needs of their populations during the pandemic. This study therefore reports data from prison residents across Ohio who accessed digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SUD during the pandemic. This study focuses on methamphetamine-involved residents given the links between use of the drug and involvement with correctional services."

            "text": "Prevalence of methamphetamine use amongst people in the United States (US) in 2019 was 1.2 million for pastmonth use (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2020). Methamphetamine use is associated with an unstable lifestyle and psychosocial risk factors that are linked to involvement in correctional services (Cumming et\u00a0al. 2020), including mental health disorders such as psychosis (Chiang et\u00a0 al. 2019), homelessness (Jones et\u00a0al. 2020), financial difficulties (McKetin et\u00a0al. 2020) and interpersonal conflict (Maltman et\u00a0 al. 2020). These factors may increase likelihood of both acquisitive (Goldsmid & Willis 2016) and violent crimes (Liu et\u00a0al. 2017).\nMental health and other psychosocial difficulties (e.g. homelessness), SUD and offending interact in multiple ways (Hamilton 2014). The \u201cself-medication\u201d hypothesis (Robinson et\u00a0 al. 2011) suggests that some people use substances as a means of coping with their mental health difficulties, or conversely, substance use may directly cause, or exacerbate, pre-existing mental health difficulties (e.g. Boden & Fergusson 2011). Alternatively there may be some other common factor that increases vulnerability to mental health and substance use issues, such as chronic stress (Brady & Sinha 2005) or certain personality traits (Kotov et\u00a0al. 2010). Substance use and mental health difficulties may start in late childhood and early adolescence (Deas & Brown 2006), often alongside significant childhood adversity (Johnson et\u00a0al. 2006), with\nthese difficulties then contributing to an increased risk of offending in adulthood (Wiesner et\u00a0al. 2005). Psychosocial risk factors are found in models describing criminogenic risk factors, one of the most influential being the \u2018risk-need-responsivity\u2019 model (RNR: Andrews et\u00a0 al. 2006). Risk factors identified within the model include family and/or marital issues, difficulties at school or work, leisure or recreation issues, and substance abuse, in addition to anti-social behaviours, cognitions, personality patterns, and associates. These risk factors provide targets for assessment and intervention in populations involved in correctional services \u2013 higher-risk offenders may experience greater reductions in recidivism from RNR-informed interventions compared to lower-risk offenders (Bonta & Andrews 2007)."

In contrast with other substances associated with involvement with correctional services, e.g. opioids (Chen et\u00a0 al. 2022) and alcohol (Akbar et\u00a0 al. 2018), there are no accepted pharmacological treatments for methamphetamine use (Siefried et\u00a0 al. 2020). The only existing treatments are psychosocial and behavioral \u2013 a systematic review demonstrated CBT and contingency management to be effective in reducing use of the drug (AshaRani et\u00a0 al. 2020), and therapeutic communities have also been demonstrated to confer therapeutic benefits in correctional (Joe et\u00a0al. 2010) and community settings (\u0160efr\u00e1nek & Miovsk\u00fd 2017). However, there may be barriers to accessing treatment for methamphetamine use, including financial costs and lack of available places in programs (Cumming et\u00a0al. 2016).\nA significant barrier to accessing both community and correctional in-person SUD services since March 2020 has been the COVID-19 pandemic. Krebs and colleagues (2021) examined the impact of the pandemic on corrections agencies across Ohio \u2013 75% of respondents reported restrictions that impacted rehabilitative\nConclusions: Digital CBT can be delivered in secure US correctional settings and may help to fill unmet needs for in\u2011person treatment. Specifically, this digital CBT program may support incarcerated individuals to address metham\u2011 phetamine use, with outcomes being associated with psychosocial risk factors and program engagement.\nKeywords: Methamphetamine, Prisons, Digital, Treatment, Cognitive behavioral therapy, Breaking Free from Substance Abuse\nprogramming, including SUD treatment. Massachusetts (Donelan et\u00a0 al. 2021) and New York State (Wang et\u00a0 al. 2021) implemented telehealth approaches to provide medications for opioid use disorders during the pandemic. Such technology-mediated approaches have been explored for the treatment of methamphetamine use in community settings (Rubenis et\u00a0 al. 2021) \u2013 this review not find significant reductions in methamphetamines use and suggested this could be due to app design features such as whether content was personalized, and participant characteristics such as personality style.\nThe potential of\u00a0digital cognitive behavioral therapy in\u00a0treating methamphetamine use Digital technology can also\u00a0 be used to deliver CBT for SUD (e.g. Carroll et\u00a0 al. 2009; Kay-Lambkin et\u00a0 al. 2009), although these programs have largely been delivered in community settings due to the\u00a0 security challenges that exist\u00a0in\u00a0prisons and jails. The only digital CBT intervention for SUD that has been delivered in secure settings is \u2018Breaking Free from Substance Abuse\u2019, which has been available in UK prisons since 2015 (Davies et\u00a0al. 2017; Elison et\u00a0 al. 2015). The program addresses dependence to multiple substances and also\u00a0 has demonstrated efficacy in community treatment services (e.g. Elison, Jones, et\u00a0al. 2017; Elison, Ward, et\u00a0 al. 2017), for people using alcohol (Ward et\u00a0al. 2019), cannabis (Elison-Davies, Wardell, et\u00a0 al. 2021) and opiates (Elison-Davies, M\u00e4rtens, et\u00a0 al. 2021). The program has demonstrated user acceptability (e.g. Dugdale et\u00a0al. 2017; Elison et\u00a0al. 2015) and characteristics of individuals accessing the program via UK treatment services have also been reported (e.g. Elison, Jones, et\u00a0al. 2017; Elison-Davies, Hayhurst, et\u00a0al. 2021).\nThe program is modular and targets the psychological and lifestyle factors that underlie SUDs. When an individual first uses it they complete a baseline assessment, which includes the \u2018Recovery Progression Measure\u2019 (RPM: Elison et\u00a0al. 2016) \u2013 the RPM measures levels of functioning in six biopsychosocial domains (see Fig.\u00a0 1). The program uses data provided by the individual when they complete the RPM to populate a visual depiction of a theoretical CBT framework, the \u2018Lifestyle Balance Model\u2019 (LBM: Davies et\u00a0al. 2015), which shows them the extent to which they may be experiencing impairments in the six domains of functioning measured by the RPM\u00a0and represented in the LBM. The program achieves this by color coding each of the six components of the LBM \u2013 red domains represent significant impairment, amber moderate impairment, and green low/no impairment. The LBM is based on the five-factor model used in CBT (Williams & Garland 2002) and incorporates principles contained in the RNR model, in terms of focusing on the interplay between an individual\u2019s cognitions, emotions, behaviors and lifestyle factors (Bonta & Andrews 2007).\nWithin the program are 12 evidence-based \u2018behavioral change techniques\u2019 (BCTs: Dugdale et\u00a0 al. 2016; Michie et\u00a0 al. 2013) that are effective in reducing substance use and biopsychosocial impairment \u2013 these 12 BCTs are located within the six components of the LBM. Each component of the LBM contains two BCTs \u2013 a psychoeducational \u2018Information Strategy\u2019 and a skills-building interactive \u2018Action Strategy\u2019. In order to complete a component of the LBM, an individual has to complete both the Information and Action Strategy associated with that component. Table\u00a0 1 provides a full description of the BCTs\u00a0contained in\u00a0the program.\nFig. 1 The lifestyle balance model\nTa bl\ne 1\nTh e\n\u2018b eh\nav io\nra l c\nha ng\ne te\nch ni\nqu es\n\u2019 (B C\nTs ) c\non ta\nin ed\nw ith\nin B\nre ak\nin g\nFr ee\nfr om\nS ub\nst an\nce A\nbu se\nCo nt\nen t i\nn Br\nea ki\nng F\nre e\nO nl\nin e\nD es\ncr ip\ntio n\nof s\ntr at\neg y\nTh er\nap eu\ntic a\npp ro\nac he\ns un\nde rp\nin ni\nng\nst ra\nte gi\nes BC\nT ta\nxo no\nm y\n(V 1)\nte ch\nni qu\nes\nBa se\nlin e\nan d\npr og\nre ss\nc he\nck a\nss es\nsm en\nts M\non ito\nrin g\nbe ha\nvi or\nto p\nro vi\nde fe\ned ba\nck a\nbo ut\npr\nog re\nss to\nw ar\nds g\noa ls\n;

This study reports data from methamphetamine users given the high rates of psychosocial risk factors experienced by this population, the significant links between methamphetamine use and incarceration (Cumming et\u00a0 al. 2020) and the lack of pharmacological treatments for use of the drug (Siefried et\u00a0al. 2020). To date, all published data from this digital CBT program has come from individuals engaging with it via UK treatment services (e.g. Elison-Davies, Hayhurst, et\u00a0 al. 2021), where methamphetamine is not a commonly used drug \u2013 a recent government report from 2020 to 2021 showed that only 505 members of the UK treatment population reported methamphetamine use (Office for Health Improvement and Disparities 2021). Therefore, this study also provides\nthe first opportunity to report data from people engaging with the program for methamphetamine use.\nThis study uses a within-subjects design to examine changes over time on a number of measures collected at baseline and post-engagement. These data are used to examine: i) baseline psychosocial risk factors experienced by Ohio prison residents, ii) changes in their scores on measures of substance dependence, mental health, quality of life and biopsychosocial impairment when engaging with the program and iii) whether baseline psychosocial risk factors are associated with these changes. Additionally, iv) patterns of engagement with components of the program, and the extent to which program engagement is associated with changes in scores on the measures used, is also reported."

Residents who had been referred to prison SUD services were offered the digital CBT program whilst in-person services were unavailable due to COVID-19 restrictions. The program was made available via secure tablet computers \u2013 participants could sign-in to the tablet using their own unique login credentials to access the program, which was available via a link on the tablet landing page. Before participants could activate an account on the program they had to agree to a \u2018Privacy and Cookies Policy\u2019 and \u2018End User License Agreement\u2019. After account activation all participants were required to complete a baseline assessment containing several standardized measures:\na) Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS: Gossop et\u00a0 al. 1997): 5-item scale measuring severity of substance dependence (e.g., cravings and substance-related\ncognitions). Internal reliability: \u03b1\u00a0 = .81\u2013.90; testretest reliability ICC\u00a0= .89. b) Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4: Kroenke et\u00a0 al. 2009): 4-item scale measuring severity of depression and anxiety. Threshold scores on the PHQ are 0\u20133 no depression/anxiety, 3\u20135 \u2018mild\u2019, 6\u20138 \u2018moderate\u2019 and 9\u201312 \u2018severe\u2019. Internal reliability, \u03b1\u00a0= .81. c) Five items (1, 2, 17, 18, 20) from the World Health Organization Quality of Life measure (WHOQoLBREF: Skevington et\u00a0 al. 2004). Items selected were generic enough to measure general quality of life as opposed to specific aspects of quality of life. Internal reliability of these five items, \u03b1\u00a0= .84. d) Recovery Progression Measure (RPM: Elison et\u00a0 al. 2016; Elison, Dugdale, et\u00a0 al. 2017): 36-item scale measuring functioning in the six domains of biopsychosocial functioning represented by the components of the LBM (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Within each of the six RPM domains there are five dichotomous \u2018yes/no\u2019 items measuring presence or absence of specific biopsychosocial difficulties within that domain, and an 11-point Likert \u2018impact scale\u2019 assessing level of severity of impairment in that domain. Internal consistency, \u03b1\u00a0 = .89; test-retest reliability, ICC\u00a0= .73. e) In addition to the standardized measures the baseline assessment also contained the following:\n\u2013 Demographic items: age, gender, and ethnicity. \u2013 Questions about what substances each participant\nwas experiencing difficulties with \u2013 this information was also used to determine whether participants were poly-substance users.\nThe program\u2019s backend database also automatically captured program engagement data: i) whether participants completed a follow-up assessment, and ii) which BCTs they had completed.\nAfter baseline assessment completion, participants were provided with access to the program and engaged with it in a self-directed manner. Each participant\u2019s account was available to them for 12-months and they could choose to engage with the program for as long as they wanted to\u00a0 during this period. The program prompts users to complete mandatory \u2018Progress Check\u2019 assessments every two weeks\u00a0 \u2013 people can also choose to complete Progress Check assessments more frequently. Data from the Progress Checks allow an individual to monitor their progress as they work through the program via a personalized dashboard."

For participants that did complete a Progress Check assessment, comparisons of scores on the assessment measures included from baseline to most recent Progress Check data were conducted using repeated-measure Mann-Whitney U tests and Cohen\u2019s effect sizes. Whilst controlling for the confounding effects of baseline scores on outcomes on the assessment measures included, linear regressions were used to examine associations between psychosocial risk factors reported at baseline and outcomes scores obtained from most recent Progress Check assessment \u2013 this was done in order to ascertain whether baseline psychosocial risk factors might predict outcomes. Associations between whether or not each of the six components in the program had been completed and outcomes scores obtained from most recent Progress Check were also examined using linear regressions \u2013 this was done to ascertain whether completion of specific components of the program might predict outcomes. Finally, linear regressions were also used to examine associations between the number of components completed and outcomes on each of the assessment measures included, in order to determine whether there\u00a0may be a \u2018dosage effect\u2019.

Effect size calculations demonstrated small effects for reductions in substance dependence (SDS: d\u00a0 = .45) and depression/anxiety (PHQ-4: d\u00a0= 0.49), and improvements in quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF: d\u00a0= 0.47), and a medium effect for reductions in biopsychosocial impairment (RPM: d\u00a0= 0.54).\nAssociations between\u00a0psychosocial risk factors and\u00a0outcomes Whilst controlling for baseline scores, a number of psychosocial risk factors appeared to predict scores at most recent Progress Check assessment (see Table\u00a04). Results of the linear regressions conducted indicated that there was a collective significant effect between each of the risk factors included in the analysis on scores at most recent Progress Check: substance dependence (SDS: F (12,1136) = 18.700, p\u00a0 < .001, R2\u00a0= 0.165), depression/anxiety (PHQ-4: F(12,1137) = 24.721, p <,001, R2\u00a0 = 0.207), quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF: F(12,1137) = 12.233, p\u00a0 < .001, R2\u00a0 = 0.114) and biopsychosocial impairment (RPM: F(12,1137) = 12.537, p\u00a0< .001, R2\u00a0= 0.117).\nIndividual risk factors appeared to be significant predictors of scores at most recent Progress Check.

Although there\nwere twice as many male as female participants, females were over-represented in relation to Ohio\u2019s prison population \u2013 there are only two women\u2019s facilities in the state compared to 23 men\u2019s facilities. This might demonstrate that women with SUD may be more receptive to digital CBT programs and deserves further investigation.\nParticipants reported a range of psychosocial risk factors\u00a0 that are common amongst methamphetamine uses, including interpersonal conflict (Dadhe & Bettman 2019; Maltman et\u00a0al. 2020), mental health difficulties including paranoia (Dadhe & Bettman 2019; McKetin et\u00a0al. 2019), impulsive and aggressive behaviors (Lanesman et\u00a0 al. 2019) and unstable accommodation and homelessness (Jones et\u00a0al. 2020; Moxley et\u00a0al. 2020). These difficulties have also been identified in the literature as criminogenic risk factors (Andrews et\u00a0 al. 2006) and are commonly experienced by incarcerated individuals who use methamphetamine (Semple et\u00a0al. 2008).\nHalf of participants completed both a baseline assessment and a Progress Check assessment \u2013 significant reductions were found in scores for severity of substance dependence, depression/anxiety and biopsychosocial functioning impairment, and a significant increase in quality of life was demonstrated. Effect sizes for changes in substance dependence severity, depression/anxiety, and quality of life were small, and the effect size for changes in biopsychosocial functioning impairment was medium. Studies of other CBT interventions for methamphetamine use (AshaRani et\u00a0 al. 2020; Lee & Rawson 2008), and previous studies of this digital CBT program with UK prison populations (Davies et\u00a0 al. 2017; Elison et\u00a0al. 2015), have obtained similar findings.\nPsychosocial risk factors reported were significantly associated with most recent Progress Check assessment scores. Interpersonal conflict was significantly associated with poorer mental health and quality of life outcomes, and more severe depression/anxiety was significantly associated with poorer quality of life and biopsychosocial functioning outcomes. Research has demonstrated that such psychosocial risk factors may predict treatment outcomes in methamphetamine users, for example, interpersonal/relationship instability (Brecht & Herbeck 2014) and mental health difficulties (McKetin et\u00a0al. 2018).\nParticipants who completed a Progress Check assessment completed more of the BCTs and components in the program that those that did not complete a Progress Check. For both Progress Check completers and non-completers, the Action and Information Strategies completed by the most participants were those in the Difficult Situations component of the program, and strategies completed by the least participants were those\u00a0 in the Unhelpful Behaviors component of the program. The Difficult Situations component supports\nindividuals to develop skills to avoid and cope with difficult or risky situations \u2013 having these skills is particularly important in a prison environment where there may be multiple risks. However, the Unhelpful Behaviors component supports individuals to plan positive activities for each day of the week \u2013 the constraints of the prison environment could prevent incarcerated people from being able to identify activities that they can feasibly enact.\nCompletion of some components within the program was significantly associated with scores at most recent Progress Check. Completion of the Difficult Situations component was significantly associated with better biopsychosocial functioning scores, and completion of the Unhelpful Behaviors component was significantly associated with lower substance dependence, and better mental health and biopsychosocial functioning scores. Completion of the Lifestyle component was significantly associated with better mental health, biopsychosocial functioning and quality of life scores. These findings indicate that interventions for methamphetamine use should incorporate self-efficacy and coping skills development components (Moos 2007), in addition to clinical approaches to support emotional regulation (Kang et\u00a0al. 2019) and positive lifestyle changes (Juel et\u00a0al. 2017). The dose response identified in previous studies of this specific digital CBT program (Elison, Jones, et\u00a0al. 2017; Elison-Davies, Wardell, et\u00a0 al. 2021), and other digital CBT for SUD studies (Mattila et\u00a0 al. 2016), was replicated in this study.\nFindings suggest that greater clinical complexity at baseline might mean some individuals may benefit from support to enhance their level of engagement with the components of the program, in order to ensure they can experience optimal clinical benefits. When this digital CBT program is delivered alongside practitioner support, this can enhance retention and improve outcomes (Elison et\u00a0al. 2014; Elison, Ward, et\u00a0al. 2017). The literature demonstrates that individuals with SUD may be at risk of dropping out of treatment if they are not appropriately supported (\u015eim\u015fek et\u00a0al. 2019). Additionally, the literature around digital CBT for depression and anxiety demonstrates greater adherence and better outcomes when such programs are delivered alongside practitioner support (Andersson et\u00a0 al. 2019). Similar findings have been obtained for digital CBT for alcohol use disorder (Sundstr\u00f6m et\u00a0al. 2016), although there are gaps in the literature around whether practitioner guided or unguided digital CBT is most appropriate for other kinds of substance use disorders (Boumparis et\u00a0al. 2019).\nAlthough this study demonstrates that digital technologies can enhance rehabilitative programming, traditional in-person delivery may still be preferred by prison\nresidents and staff. Introduction of such technologies can sometimes be perceived by staff as being disruptive as they may not feel they have the capacity to become familiar with new technologies (Davies et\u00a0al. 2017). There may also be concerns around the security implications of providing digital technologies in secure settings \u2013 there have been examples of incarcerated people using digital technologies for nefarious means. However, work can be done to ensure rehabilitative technologies undergo thorough security checks before they are introduced into correctional settings, as was the case during the introduction of Breaking Free from Substance Use across ODRC.\nAs digital rehabilitative programming becomes more common, many of the benefits people experience from in-person support might be lost \u2013 however, digital programs need not eradicate the role of staff in program delivery. Many digital CBT programs are designed to be delivered as self-directed interventions and also \u2018computer-assisted therapies\u2019, with users being supported to engage with program content by staff. Additionally, digital programs are not necessarily designed to replace inperson support but augment it, especially during times when in-person support may be limited.\nHad Breaking Free from Substance Use been introduced across ODRC before the pandemic it is not known whether the same amount of engagement would have been seen. However, the interactive nature of digital programs may be appealing to people in prisons and jails who may be bored or may have difficulties with concentration \u2013 work completed by the authors years before the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that even in non-pandemic times this treatment modality can be well received by incarcerated individuals (Davies et\u00a0 al. 2017; Elison et\u00a0 al. 2015). And regardless, it looks likely that health service delivery, and rehabilitation programming delivery, has been changed for the long-term as a result of the heavy reliance on digital technology during the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic."

            "text": "Limitations include that participants were self-selecting and a comparison group was not included given this study was an exploratory observational study, not a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Only half of participants completed a Progress Check assessment \u2013 the reasons for this could not be determined from data available. Attrition rates in digital intervention studies have been identified as a problem (Eysenbach 2005), with a recent review finding that even in highly controlled RCTs, the average attrition rate is 48% (Torous et\u00a0al. 2020) \u2013 attrition in studies with SUD populations\ncan also be high (Radtke et\u00a0al. 2017). Additionally,\u00a0it is difficult to determine whether changes in assessment scores were due to the clinical impact of the program or because some participants had higher levels of motivation and readiness to change. Therefore, determining effectiveness of the program for methamphetamine users via a RCT is an appropriate next step\u00a0 \u2013 a RCT could also build in longitudinal follow-up to explore how people fare when they return back to the community from prison."

            "text": "This study reports data from US prison residents engaging with a digital CBT program for SUD. This study identified high rates of psychosocial risk factors commonly associated with methamphetamine use, and that these risk factors were associated with biopsychosocial changes experienced by people engaging with this program. Despite the clinical complexity of the group, they experienced significant reductions in substance dependence, depression/anxiety, and biopsychosocial impairment, and significant improvements in quality of life. Program engagement was associated with these changes and a dose response was identified, indicating that some prison residents might benefit from support when engaging with digital programs such as Breaking Free from Substance Abuse.\nAbbreviations BCT: behavioral change technique; CBT: cognitive behavioral therapy; ODRC: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections; PHQ\u20114: Patient Health Questionnaire\u20114; RPM: Recovery Progression Measure; SDS: Severity of Dependence Scale; SUD: substance use disorder; UK: United Kingdom; US: United States; WHOQoL\u2011BREF: World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale.\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to thank all the treatment clients and staff who have supported the development and delivery of the Breaking Free from Substance Abuse program over the past decade.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions SED led on study conception and design, obtained ethical approval, analysed data, and drafted the manuscript; JN reviewed the data analysis and provided reviewed and revised the manuscript; AJ reviewed the data analysis and provided reviewed and revised the manuscript; GD reviewed and revised the manuscript; JW reviewed and revised the manuscript.
