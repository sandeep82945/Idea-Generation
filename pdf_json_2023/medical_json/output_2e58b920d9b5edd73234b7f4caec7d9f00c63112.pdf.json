For the acute toxicity study, three rats in the acute control group were fed 2,000mg/kg of PSPL for 14 days. The subacute toxicity study included six rats each in four groups administered 50, 250, 500, or 1,000mg/kg for 28 days and observed for further 14 days without treatment in the subacute control and subacute satellite groups. Changes in body weight; blood biochemistry; hematological parameters; relative organ weight; and histological sections of the heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, aorta, and retina were observed for signs of toxicity.\nResults: The gradual increase in weekly body weight, normal level full blood count, normal liver and kidney profile, relative organ weight, and histological sections of all stained organ tissue in the treated group compared with the acute, subacute, and satellite control groups demonstrated the absence of signs of toxicity.\nConclusion: Lutein-rich PSPL extract shows no signs of toxicity up to 2,000mg/kg/day.\nKEYWORDS\nmedicinal plant, purple sweet potato, plant extract, phytochemicals, bioactive compounds, toxicity, animal study"

            "text": "Functional foods have attracted research attention due to safety concerns. Any natural product containing bioactive molecules integrated into food is known as a functional food. In this context, one of the widely used functional food currently being studied is PSPL (Khairani et al., 2022). PSPL, also known as Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the botanical family of Convolvulaceae. It is widely known for its natural medicinal properties, with the leaf itself containing up to 130 known metabolites (Naomi et al., 2021). This plant usually grows well in tropical and subtropical regions and is widely cultivated in more than 100 countries worldwide (Alam, 2021). In China alone, PSPL cultivation exceeds more than 76% of the world\u2019s production (Nguyen et al., 2021). This is attributed due to the plant\u2019s high drought tolerance and ability to grow in changing climates (Shekhar et al., 2014). Purple sweet potato is the sixth most common crop worldwide, with the highest production in the southeastern parts of India (Alam, 2021). Approximately, 115 million metric tons of sweet potatoes are cultivated annually through vegetative propagation (Mohanraj and Sivasankar, 2014). Most parts of the purple sweet potato can be eaten since they contain nutritional and bioactive compounds. Purple sweet potatoes are significantly rich in lutein, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fibers, and \u03b2-carotene compared to other commonly available major greens in Asian countries (Alam, 2021). A recent study showed that PSPL is a strong antioxidant with radical scavenging ability due to the presence of natural bioactive compounds such as anthocyanin (Yuzhi Jiao Studies on antioxidant, 2012). Due to its natural essences, PSPL has been formulated into a probiotic to make its consumption easier and so that more people can experience the maximum\nbenefits (Kim et al., 2015). Some of the other identified minerals in PSPL include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, manganese, and zinc (Sun et al., 2014).\nThe most well-known health benefit of purple sweet potato is its anti-diabetic effects due to xenobiotic phytochemical constituents (Struga\u0142a et al., 2019). Some of the plant\u2019s genotypes are associated with nutraceutical value (Escobar-Puentes et al., 2022). Despite its known functional value, the plant is underutilized, possibly due to safety concerns regarding the consumption of the natural plant and the lack of scientific data on its therapeutic use. In some countries, I. batatas is completely avoided by women due to concerns about unintentional miscarriages. However, no specific study has reported that I. batatas is toxic for consumption or its adverse effects in pregnant subjects (Gunn et al., 2013). A previous study reported that purple sweet potato contains oxalic acid, which has the potential be converted into oxalate stones in the urinary tract. Thus, to avoid unwanted adverse effects, individuals with a history of kidney stones should avoid eating purple sweet potatoes (Noonan and Savage, 1999). However, this remains unconfirmed since no recent data have been reported regarding the safety and efficacy of purple sweet potatoes. Hence, the present study evaluated the toxicological effects of PSPL extract in male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats.\n2 Results\n2.1 Lutein quantification\nFigure 1 shows the chromatograms of lutein quantification from 1 g of PSPL extract and the peak maxima of the lutein fractions. A variety of peaks have been recorded for the desired lutein compound, with a total quantified lutein content of\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\napproximately 20.25% in 1 g of PSPL extract. The maximal elution was recorded at a peak area % of 51.38% at the 14th minute."

            "text": "PSPL is traditionally known for its beneficial therapeutic effects (Akhtar et al., 2018). However, it remains underutilized due to safety concerns. The results of the present study showed that the PSPL extract contained the highest % of lutein compound, approximately 20.25%, compared to other leafy vegetables (Sahli et al., 2015). The study is divided into two phases. The first phase focused on the phytochemical analysis of lutein percentage, while the second phase focused on the toxicological evaluation of PSPL extract in male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. The safety analysis of PSPL extracts in SD male rats in the first phase was further categorized into acute or subacute studies. In the acute study, a single maximum dose of 2,000 mg/kg per body weight did not induce any side effects or behavioral or sleep abnormalities. All rats survived until necropsy. Similar findings were observed in the subacute study, including satellite groups comprising four different doses (ST 50, ST 250, ST 500, and ST 1000) of PSPL. Neither the acute nor the subacute studies revealed any drastic or significant changes in body weight, organ weight, calorie intake, or water consumption from the beginning to the end of the assessment period.\nDue to their roles in metabolism and excretion, the liver and kidneys are the most important organs to rule out toxicity (Peter et al., 2018). Gross examination and histopathological changes indicate toxicity (Zakaria et al., 2011). However, the similar histological features of the kidney and liver between the AT 2000 and AC groups; between the ST 50, ST 250, ST 500, and ST 1000 groups and the SC group; and between the SST 1000 and SSC groups further proves the safety of up to 2,000 mg/kg of PSPL extract. The gross examinations of the liver and kidney revealed no changes in the treated groups compared to the control group. In addition, H&E staining of the retina, pancreas, heart, and aorta to assess any abnormalities showed that the treated group was indistinguishable from the control groups in both acute and subacute studies. Moreover, the liver and kidney profile assessments of the blood biochemistry appeared within normal ranges for all assessed parameters, specifically ALP, AST, and ALP, which are also biomarkers of liver toxicity (Meunier and Larrey, 2019), thus further proving that the PSPL extract was safe for consumption up to a dose of 2,000 mg/kg.\nChanges in hematological parameters are an indicator of the emergence of toxicity (Kamisan et al., 2012). However, the administration of 2,000 mg/kg of PSPL extract caused a significant increase in MCV and MCHC compared to AC. Increased MCV suggests macrocytic effects, while increased MCHC is associated with hyperchromic effects. Such conditions are usually associated with increased RBC rigidity (Tempelhoff et al., 2016). However, given the normal levels of other blood parameters (RBC, WBC, HB, platelet, RDW, and MCH), the possibilities of macrocytic and hyperchromic conditions were ruled out. The slight increase in MCV and MCHC in the AT 2000 group could be due to incidental instead of treatment-related effects. Moreover, MCV and MCHC usually increase with age (Tempelhoff et al., 2016). Thus, slight increases in MCH and MCHC are not concerning. Hence, the findings regarding the changes in body weight, organ weight, calorie intake, water consumption, blood biochemistry assessment, hematological analysis, and histopathological assessments in the acute and subacute studies demonstrated that the administration of up to 2,000 mg/kg/day of PSPL extract is a tolerable dosage.\nFIGURE 4 Histology sections for the satellite groups in the subacute studies. No abnormalities in the histological sections of the retina, kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, and aorta of the SST 1000-treated group were observed compared to the SSC group.

The therapeutic effects of the extract in biomedical applications were further analyzed. No signs of toxicity in the blood components or serum biochemical measures were observed in either the acute and subacute studies. The toxicological evaluation showed no abnormalities in the tissue histology nor gross morphology of the retina, kidney, liver, pancreas, aorta, and heart, indicating that the administration of up to 2,000 mg/kg/day of PSPL was well-tolerated. However, further assessments of the genotoxicity, compound toxicity, and subchronic and chronic toxicity are needed before proceeding with clinical trials, and it is highly recommended to test the compound in various age groups before PSPL use in clinical prescriptions."

The leaves were cleaned and sent to Herbarium Biodiversity Unit, Universiti Putra Malaysia for confirmation (voucher code: MFI 0188/20).\n5.2 Ethanol extraction of Ipomoea batatas leaves\nThe PSPL leaves were cleaned with running tap water to remove any foreign material. About 20 g of PSPL leaves was soaked in 200 mL of 80% ethanol in a conical flask. The mixture was then placed in an orbital incubator shaker for 24 h at 150 rpm at room temperature. The supernatant was then collected and filtered using Whatman N\u00b01 paper. The process was repeated three times to obtain the maximum yield. The filtrates from each extraction were then combined and evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 48\u00b0C. The obtained crude extract was then mixed with maltodextrin in a 1:1 ratio and oven-dried overnight (Fu et al., 2016). The final extracted powder was then weighed and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use.\n5.3 HPLC quantification of the active compounds\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) estimation of the lutein compound was performed in an Agilent 1200 Infinity instrument (Agilent Technology, United States) equipped with a DAD detector, an autosampler, a column heater, and a Welchrom\u00ae C18 (4.67 mm ID, 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size) column.

With a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, gradient elution was performed using the two solvents at a detection wavelength of 348 nm. A 20 \u03bcL sample volume was injected into the system by the autosampler. About 10.97 mg of the isolated esculetin was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol, while 6.26 mg PSPL extract was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol. HPLC was then performed for both the standard and sample (Makwana and Pandya, 2020)."
