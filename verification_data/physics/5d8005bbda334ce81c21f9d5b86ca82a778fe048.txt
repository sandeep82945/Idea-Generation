"In principle, the most stable structure involves the encapsulation of one and four He atoms inside the D and H sII cages, respectively; however, more He atoms could be entrapped under lower temperature and/or higher pressure thermodynamic conditions. We foresee such accurate computational quantum chemistry approaches contributing to the current emerging machine learning model development."
