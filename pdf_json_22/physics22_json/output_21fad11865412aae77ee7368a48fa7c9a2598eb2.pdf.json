Several active detector systems were used.\nResults: The neutron dose mapping within the gantry room showed that H*(10) values significantly decreased with distance and angular deviation with respect to the beam axis. A maximum value of about 19.5 \u00b5Sv/Gy was measured along the beam axis at 1 m from the isocenter for a 10-year-old pediatric phantom at 270\u00b0 gantry angle. A minimum value of 0.1 \u00b5Sv/Gy was measured at a distance of 2.25 m perpendicular to the beam axis for a 1-year-old pediatric phantom at 140\u00b0 gantry angle.The H*(10) dependence on the size of the pediatric patient was observed. At 270\u00b0 gantry position, the measured neutron H*(10) values for the 10-year-old pediatric phantom were up to 20% higher than those measured for the 5-year-old and up to 410% higher than for the 1-year-old phantom, respectively.\nConclusions: Using active neutron detectors, secondary neutron mapping was performed to characterize the neutron field generated during proton therapy of pediatric\nJuly 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 9037061\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org\npatients. It is shown that the neutron ambient dose equivalent H*(10) significantly decreases with distance and angle with respect to the beam axis. It is reported that the total neutron exposure of a person staying at a position perpendicular to the beam axis at a distance greater than 2 m from the isocenter remains well below the dose limit of 1 mSv per year for the general public (recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection) during the entire treatment course with a target dose of up to 60 Gy. This comprehensive analysis is key for general neutron shielding issues, for example, the safe operation of anesthetic equipment. However, it also enables the evaluation of whether it is safe for parents to remain near their children during treatment to bring them comfort. Currently, radiation protection protocols prohibit the occupancy of the treatment room during beam delivery.\nKeywords: scanning proton therapy, anthropomorphic pediatric phantom, secondary neutrons, active neutron monitors, ambient dose equivalent, clinical conditions"

            "text": "In recent years, tremendous technical progress has enabled proton therapy facilities to become more compact and costeffective. Their clinical applications have expanded beyond brain and eye tumors, and this has drastically increased the number of patients receiving such treatment worldwide (1). Stray neutron radiation inherent to proton therapy remains, however, a topic of concern for the protection of both patients, especially pediatric patients (higher sensitivity and longer life expectancy), and healthcare professionals (shielding design) (2\u20136).\nDose limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (7) are specified in terms of the protection quantity effective dose, E. These limits ensure that individuals are not exposed to unnecessarily high doses and so are a fundamental component of radiation protection in most countries. This protection quantity\u2014effective dose\u2014is not measurable. This means that an operational quantity\u2014ambient dose equivalent, H*(10)\u2014is used instead as a conservative estimate of effective dose, E. Such an approach also applies for estimating stray radiation exposures in radiotherapy including proton and ion therapy. The limits are split into two groups, public and occupationally exposed workers. Within Europe for the public, the effective dose limit is 1 mSv/year (higher values are allowed in a single year if the average over 5 years is not above 1 mSv/year), while for the occupationally exposed workers, it is 20 mSv/year, averaged over defined periods of 5 years with no single year exceeding 50 mSv. In the U.S., the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires to limit the occupational exposure to 50 mSv per year. Dose limits do not apply to medical exposures; however, the concept of radiation protection is still relevant.\nMany authors have used Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and/or experimental tools to determine and model stray neutrons in scattering and scanning proton therapy (8\u201312). In a continuous effort to assess neutron exposure in proton therapy, Working Group 9 of the European Radiation\n2\nDosimetry Group (EURADOS WG9\u2014Radiation dosimetry in radiotherapy) has performed a comprehensive intercomparison exercise to estimate neutron spectra and ambient dose equivalent around children treated using a spot scanning technique. At first, the work focused on determining neutron variability around a water phantom for a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 cm3 target (13). Next, neutron variability with beam parameters (energy, field size, modulation width) was measured and a simplistic parametric model describing neutron doses around the phantom was suggested (14). For these measurements, extended-range Bonner sphere spectrometry systems, neutron rem counters, and tissue-equivalent proportional counters were used and benchmarked to help in selecting the optimal detector for proton therapy neutron spectra (15). In addition to environmental measurements, EURADOS WG9 also measured neutron doses in both water and anthropomorphic phantoms, using bubble, etched track, thermoluminescent, and radiophotoluminescent detectors (16\u201320).\nKnezevic and colleagues have measured secondary neutron dose equivalent in pediatric phantoms during a simulated brain tumor treatment in the pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton facility at the Cyclotron Centre Bronowice, IFJ PAN Krako\u0301w (21). They observed a slightly higher neutron dose in a 10-yearold phantom compared to a 5-year-old phantom in all organs at distances from 20 cm to 30 cm from the isocenter. Nevertheless, the ambient dose equivalent dependence on patient size measured around the pediatric phantoms in the treatment room has not been yet systematically studied.\nIn this work, a brain tumor treatment, without a range shifter, was simulated using a set of pediatric anthropomorphic phantoms representing a 1-, 5-, and 10-year-old pediatric patient. Two different beam angles were considered to achieve clinically acceptable tumor coverage while optimizing the sparing of healthy organs at risks. Neutron stray radiation measurements were hence performed around the phantoms at eight different locations using the same set of active neutron monitors as previously benchmarked.\nJuly 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 903706"

CIRS ATOM\u00ae phantoms comprise 25-mm-thick sections with minimal interfaces between the slabs. The 1-year-old phantom is provided with arms and legs as a standard configuration, while arms and legs for 5-year and 10-year models can be fitted separately. The size and weight of each model is based on ICRP 23 (22), ICRU 48 (23), and available anatomical references (see Table 1). CIRS ATOM\u00ae phantoms are constructed from materials simulating average soft tissue, average bone tissue, cartilage, spinal cord, spinal disks, lung, brain, and sinus. Simulated bone tissue for pediatric models matches age-related density.\nProton Beam Specification, Irradiation Technique, and Irradiation Plans The experiment was carried out at the Cyclotron Center Bronowice (CCB) , which is a part of the Henryk Niewodniczan\u0301ski Institute of Nuclear Physics of Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN) in Krako\u0301w, Poland. The center is equipped with the Proteus C-235 cyclotron (IBA, Ion Beam Applications S.A., Belgium) able to accelerate protons for clinical use up to 226 MeV. Three treatment rooms have been available at CCB since 2016 for proton radiotherapy of cancer patients. These are two IBA 360\u00b0 gantries with dedicated Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) nozzles and a horizontal 70-MeV eye line. Computed tomography (CT) scans of CIRS phantoms representing 1-, 5-, and 10-year-old children were performed with the Siemens Somatom Definition AS Open scanner with a slice thickness of 0.2 cm, and then used in an Eclipse 13.6 Treatment Planning System (Varian Medical Systems) for preparation of irradiation plans calculated with the Proton Convolution Superposition (PCS) algorithm. The distance of the gantry nozzle to the isocenter inside the tumor was 46 cm. The spot size varied depending on the beam energy and depth inside the phantom. In the air at a distance of 46 cm from the gantry nozzle, 100-MeV and 140-MeV proton beams led to spot sizes of 5.3 mm and 4.4 mm, respectively. Two fields (proton beam directions) were applied to uniformly irradiate the 6-cmdiameter spherical target (5 cm tumor diameter plus 1 cm margin) situated inside the left hemisphere of the head\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 3\n(intracranial tumor) (see Figure 1). The isocenter was located in the middle of slice #3 of the CIRS phantom. The detailed position of the isocenter is shown in Figure 1.\nFor each pediatric phantom, a specific irradiation plan was prepared. In the case of the 5-year-old phantom for the first field, 2,231 individual proton beams (spots) in 27 layers were deposited at a gantry position of 270\u00b0 with a maximal and minimal energy of 137.7 MeV and 84.0 MeV, respectively. The second field was irradiated at a gantry angle of 140\u00b0 using 2,168 spots in 30 layers, with a maximal and minimal energy of 127.5 MeV and 71.6 MeV, respectively. Proton beam specifications for all irradiation plans are given in Table 2. A high proton dose was required to create neutrons measurable with acceptable precision. Thus, a total physical dose of ~100 Gy was delivered to the target volume for the 5-year and 10-year phantoms and ~40 Gy for the 1-year phantom. The dose was delivered from two beam directions with 60% of the dose with gantry position at 270\u00b0 and 40% of the dose with gantry position at 140\u00b0. For reference dosimetry, a Semiflex-type ionization chamber (PTW 31010, Freiburg, Germany) with a Unidos Webline electrometer (PTW-Freiburg, Germany) was used together with an RW3 slab phantom."

Additionally, the Thermo Scientific\u2122 RadEye\u2122 NL from IRSN was applied. Further details are given in the Appendix.\nThe most important neutron monitor criterion for the successful measurements in neutron fields with a wide energy range, typically from thermal up to several hundred MeV, is its fluence response as a function of neutron energy. In the most favorable case, it should follow the shape of the H*(10)/F energy dependence. In Figure 4, the neutron fluence response functions of the monitors used are plotted together with the H*(10)/F fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients as recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection 74 (31) and extended to high energies with data from Pelliccioni (32). According to the fluence response functions shown in Figure 4, it could be concluded that conventional neutron rem counters such as Berthold LB 6411 and NM2B-458 are not well suited for high-energy neutron fields as encountered in a proton therapy treatment room. Since high-energy neutrons contribute significantly to H*(10), conventional neutron rem counters (LB-6411 and NM2B-458) with decreased response to neutrons above 10 MeV and calibrated in Am-Be or Cf-252 fields considerably underestimate neutron H*(10) (13). The drop in the response of the RadEye\u2122NL pager for neutrons above about 1 MeV is also evident in Figure 4.\nSpectral Index The same shape of the fluence response function of NM2B495Pb and NM2B-458 rem counters from thermal neutrons up\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 4\nto about 10 MeV (see Figure 4) provides the unique possibility to swiftly estimate the contribution of high-energy neutrons to the totalH*(10) without time-consuming neutron spectrometry. The so-called spectral index (SI) is here defined as a ratio of H*(10) measured with a high-energy extended rem counter NM2B495Pb and conventional NM2B-458. In situations where neutron spectrometry could not be carried out because of time constraints for example, the SI value can provide a reliable first guess estimation of the spectrum shape and the corresponding contribution of high-energy neutrons to ambient dose equivalent, H*(10).\nWorking group WG9 of EURADOS reported the results of a measurement campaign in the Trento proton therapy center (PTC) (13) where secondary neutron spectra were generated by a scanning proton beam targeting a cuboidal water tank phantom with dimensions of 30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 60 cm3. Neutron spectra were recorded by extended-range Bonner sphere spectrometer (ERBSS) systems, and H*(10) values were assessed by the same NM2B rem counters, as used in this study, at four positions around the phantom (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 135\u00b0). The Trento study showed that high-energy neutrons (>20 MeV) largely dominate the measured spectra along the beam axis (up to 60%) and drop with respect to the direction of the incident beam reaching 25% at 45\u00b0, 5% at 90\u00b0, and only 2% at 135\u00b0 (see Figure 5). The spectral index in the Trento PTC was estimated to be equal to 2.25 along the beam axis (i.e., at 0\u00b0), 1.4 at 45\u00b0, 1.05 at 90\u00b0, and 1.0 at 135\u00b0.\nExperimental conditions in the Trento and Krako\u0301w PTC are very similar and only differ by the beam size (10 \u00d7 10 cm2 square field in Trento versus 6 cm diameter in Krako\u0301w) and maximum proton energy (172 MeV in Trento versus 144 MeV in Krako\u0301w). Positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Farah et al. (13) correspond to positions B, C, D, and E in this study for gantry position at 270\u00b0."

It should be noted that at positions where SI \u2265 1.05, the H*(10) values measured with conventional rem counters (LB-6411 and NM2B-458) and RadEye\u2122NL pager were omitted by data cleansing. For each specific position, the average value of all measured H*(10) was calculated and is shown in Figure 7 per treatment Gy for the gantry position of 270\u00b0 and in Figure 8 for the gantry position of 140\u00b0 for three pediatric phantoms used.\nThe H*(10) values show a significant decrease with both distance and angular position with respect to the beam axis. The highest neutron H*(10) value of 19.5 \u00b5Sv/Gy was measured along the beam axis at a distance of 1.0 m from the isocenter (position B) for the 10-year-old child at 270\u00b0 gantry position. The minimum H*(10) value of 0.1 \u00b5Sv/Gy was measured at a distance of 2.25 m perpendicular to the beam axis (position D) for the 1-year-old child and for a 140\u00b0 gantry angle.\nThe differences between H*(10) values in Figures 7, 8 clearly show the influence of specific proton beam parameters such as beam direction, maximal proton energy, and range of protons (see Table 2). It should be noted that the energy of protons determines both the maximum energy of produced neutrons and also the range of protons. However, the range of each spot also depends on the density of the material on the proton path. To characterize the range of the proton field, R80 of the depth dose profile along the main axis of the beam was measured in the treatment planning system (TPS). For example, in the 1-year-old phantom, R80 for the field with energies 77\u2013129 MeV is about 10.6 cm, while for the 10-year-old phantom, R80 for the field with energies 99\u2013145 MeV increases to about 13.3 cm, which means that for a higher proton energy, a higher amount of secondary neutrons is generated along the longer proton path and a higher H*(10) is observed.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 6\nAt 270\u00b0 gantry position, measured H*(10) values are below 2.1 \u00b5Sv/Gy at all positions except along the beam direction (position B).

It should be noted that measurements at positions H and B were not possible at gantry angles 270\u00b0 and 140\u00b0, respectively, because of spatial limitations (see Figure 3)."

It means that the total neutron exposure of a person located at a position perpendicular to the beam axis at a distance greater than 2 m from the isocenter (e.g., at position D) does not exceed 60 \u00b5Sv during the whole treatment course for a total target dose of 60 Gy (in 30 fractions). This dose remains well below the annual dose limit of 1 mSv for the general public (recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection). It should be noted that the H*(10) of 60 \u00b5Sv is comparable with a calculated effective dose of 52 \u00b5Sv received by passengers from galactic cosmic rays on a single flight from Munich to New York (~9 h flight duration) in the time period of solar minimum (33) using fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients as recommended in ICRP Publication\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 8\n103 (7). In other words, for the investigated treatment plan, the unwanted exposure, due to a presence in the room 2 m from the isocenter during an entire spot scanning proton radiotherapy treatment (30 fractions), is by at least an order of magnitude lower than the annual dose limit for the public.\nThis comprehensive analysis of variability of H*(10) is of key importance for neutron shielding and, for example, for safe operation of anesthetic equipment. Moreover, it also enables the evaluation of whether it is safe for parents to remain near their children during treatment to bring them comfort, which could even avoid anesthesia during treatment and/or reduce movement during treatment.\nNevertheless, current work does not yet allow the generalization of such practices, as neutron H*(10) depends on treatment plan parameters such as size of the target, patient\nJuly 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 903706\nposition, number of beams, beam incidence, and proton energies (14). Future work will be needed to extensively study the impact of such parameters in order to generalize findings to ensure appropriate shielding, the safe operation of anesthesia, and the safe presence of parents during treatment of their children.\nAnother limitation is that, even though the experiment was conducted under conditions close to realistic treatment scenarios, no range shifter was used, as during the experiment, the range shifter was not fully commissioned. Therefore, for one of the treatment fields, a range shifter could not be used, and the tumor, located in the left hemisphere of the brain, was irradiated from the right side (270\u00b0 angle) instead of the choice for a leftsided beam orientation. As such, the proton energy was slightly increased to reach the appropriate depth in brain and the clinical translatability is challenged. Even though this can be considered a limitation of the study, we believe that the corresponding neutronH*(10) can be considered as a conservative estimation of the H*(10), as it is increasing with increasing proton energy (14), and general findings of the paper are consistent."

            "text": "The measurements performed to investigate the secondary neutron dose around 1-, 5-, and 10-year-old children in clinical PBS proton therapy showed that the size of the pediatric patient influences the magnitude of the neutron ambient dose equivalent at various positions in the treatment room. The clear dependence of H*(10) values on the size and age of the pediatric patient was observed mainly for the 270\u00b0 proton beam direction (gantry position at 270\u00b0). In this case, H*(10) values for the 10-year-old child were up to 20% higher than those measured for the 5-year-old child and up to 290% higher than for the 1-year-old child.\nThis study also showed that the neutron ambient dose equivalent H*(10) decreases with distance from the isocenter and strongly depends on the position angle with respect to the beam axis. The highest H*(10) values were always measured along the beam axis, while the lowest H*(10) values were measured at positions located perpendicularly to the beam axis. The highest neutron ambient dose equivalent of about 19.5 \u00b5Sv/Gy was measured at a distance of 1.0 m from the isocenter along the beam axis (i.e., at closest point during experiment) at a gantry position of 270\u00b0 for the 10-year-old pediatric phantom. H*(10) values significantly decreased to 0.1 \u00b5Sv/Gy at a distance of 2.25 m perpendicular to the beam axis for a 1-year-old pediatric phantom at a gantry position of 140\u00b0.\nIt was also demonstrated that during the whole treatment course with a target dose \u2264 60 Gy, the total neutron exposure of a person at a position perpendicular to the beam axis at a distance of 2.25 m remains well below the annual dose limit for the public. For the specific conditions of this study, it may be concluded that parents could remain 2 m away from their children to bring them comfort and possibly limit risks of patient motion during therapy, which could jeopardize treatment quality. Currently, the radiation protection protocols prohibit the occupancy of the\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 9\ntreatment room during beam delivery. The very low doses demonstrated here suggest that for proton therapy under the conditions described in this paper, the procedures and practices could be re-assessed. However, further work is required before definitive guidance on parental occupancy of the treatment room could be given."

Instruments A-1: NM2B-495Pb and NM2B-458 rem counter NM2B-458 and NM2B-495Pb (NE Technology Ltd., commercially available as an instrument pair NM500 and NM500X from M\u00fcnchener Apparatebau f\u00fcr elektronische Ger\u00e4te, GmbH) are cylindrical Andersson-Braun rem counters measuring neutron ambient dose equivalent, H*(10). Both rem counters are based on cylindrical BF3 proportional counters of 3.1 cm outer diameter and 7.2 cm active length surrounded by an inner polyethylene moderator (1.7 cm thick), a 0.6-cm-thick boron-doped synthetic rubber absorber, and an outer polyethylene moderator (6.9 cm thick). In the case of the NM2B-495Pb model, a 1-cm-thick lead shell surrounding the boron rubber is added to extend the detection range to highenergy neutrons.\nThe fluence response functions from thermal to 10 GeV were calculated by means of different Monte Carlo codes, i.e., MCNP (34) for energy below 20 MeV, and LAHET (35), HADRON (36), and MCNPX (37) above 20 MeV. Details are described in Mares et al. (25). All calibrations were performed in HMGU using 185 GBq (5 Ci) 241Am-Be (a,n) neutron source with an average neutron energy of 4.4 MeV (38\u201340). Both rem counters were also calibrated in 100 and 300 MeV quasi-monoenergetic neutron fields at RCNP in Osaka, Japan (41) and at CERF (https://tis-div-rp-cerf.web.cern.ch/). The measurement uncertainties were estimated to be \u00b120% for the NM2B-495Pb extended-range rem counter, and \u00b130% for the NM2B-458 conventional one.\nIn the present experiment in CCB Krako\u0301w, pulse height spectra were registered to control the photon background, to correct for pile-ups, and to properly set the region of interest (ROI) to evaluate appropriate number of counts. Applying the calibration factors estimated in HMGU, the ROI counts can be converted to corresponding ambient dose equivalent, H*(10).\nA-2: LB 6411 Berthold The LB 6411 probe (Berthold Technologies) consists of a polyethylene moderator sphere with a diameter of 25 cm and a cylindrical 3He proportional counter at its center. This monitor is designed to measure neutron ambient dose equivalent H*(10) in the neutron energy range from thermal to 20 MeV. It is known to have a strongly decreasing sensitivity to neutrons above 20 MeV. The relative dose response function of the LB 6411 over the whole energy range was calculated with MCNP Monte Carlo code by Burgkhardt et al. (26). The calculated response was benchmarked with measurements in monoenergetic neutron reference fields.\nThe 252Cf neutron source has been used for calibration. The calibration factor of 0.353 nSv/count is used to display the data as H*(10). The response to gamma radiation is about 10\u22123 counts per nSv. The overall measurement uncertainty of about 30% mainly include the uncertainties in detector calibration, dose delivery, detector positioning, and the energy response of the detectors.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 12\nA-3: WENDI-II The WENDI-II (manufacturer: Thermo Scientific) is an extended-range rem counter built by Olsher et al. (42). It has an outer diameter of 22.86 cm and consists of a 3He proportional counter surrounded by a cylindrical polyethylene assembly with an inner tungsten shell. Compared to a conventional rem counter, such as, e.g., the Berthold LB 6411, the sensitivity to high energy neutrons (E > 20 MeV) is significantly higher thanks to inelastic (n,xn) reactions occurring in the tungsten layer.\nThe 252Cf calibration constant of the WENDI-II used for these measurements is 0.317 nSv/count. The relative dose response function, calculated as the absolute response function multiplied by this calibration constant and divided by the fluence-to-H*(10) conversion coefficients is shown in De Smet et al. (27, 43). The overall measurement uncertainty mainly including the uncertainties in detector calibration and the energy response of the detectors was estimated to be of about 20%.\nA-4: \u201cHAWK\u201d Tissue-equiva lent proport ional counter monitor\nThe HAWK environmental Monitoring System FW-AD type 1 is a tissue-equivalent proportional counter from Far West Technology Inc. (Goleta, California, USA), composed of a spherical chamber (127 mm diameter) with a wall from A-150 tissue-equivalent plastic (2 mm thick) and filled with pure propane gas at low pressure (about 9.33 hPa) simulating a 2- mm site size (44). The outer container is made of 6.35-mm-thick stainless steel. The dose equivalent is calculated from a spectrum of single energy deposition events and a radiation quality factor Q, determined by the Q(L) relation given in ICRP 60 (45), where L denotes the unrestricted linear energy transfer (LET) in the exposed material (7).\nHAWK type 1 systems use two linear multichannel analyzers working in parallel with low and high gains. The low-gain analog-to-digital converter (ADC) measures LET spectra up to 1024 keV\u00b7mm\u22121 with 1 keV\u00b7mm\u22121 resolution. The high-gain channel uses an ADC measuring up to a lineal energy of 25.6 keV\u00b7mm\u22121 with a resolution of 0.1 keV\u00b7mm\u22121. The energy deposition of the low-LET and high-LET components and the associated quality factor are stored in an output file once per minute. The separation between the low-LET and the high-LET component is set at 10 keV\u00b7mm\u22121 according to the Q(L) relationship (7). Events encountering significant electronic noise below the so-called low energy threshold (0.3 keV\u00b7mm\u22121 for the HAWK used here) are not recorded. For data analysis, a simple coefficient (the average of correction factor determined for 60Co and 137Cs gamma-rays) was applied (46). No compensation of the counting loss due to dead time is included in the analysis software.\nCorrection factors, Nlow and Nhigh, to ambient dose equivalent for the low-LET and high-LET components of the dose equivalent are used. Nlow was determined in photon radiation fields with 60Co and 137Cs sources. Nhigh was defined using the neutron reference sources of 241Am\u2013Be or 252Cf neutron sources. The values of Nlow are 1.11 \u00b1 0.02 and 1.34 \u00b1 0.03, and the values of Nhigh are 0.80 \u00b1 0.09 and 0.84 \u00b1 0.10 for IRSN and SL, respectively. Correction coefficients for neutrons\nJuly 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 903706\nwere also evaluated for neutron energies between 0.5 and 19 MeV and were found similar to Am\u2013Be or 252Cf neutron sources (47).\nA-5: Tissue-equivalent proportional counter TEPC The TEPC (Model LET-SW5, Far West Technology) used for these measurements is spherical, with an internal diameter of 12.55 cm and a 2-mm-thick shell of A-150 tissue-equivalent plastic. The TEPC was filled with propane tissue-equivalent gas at a pressure of 8.8 mbar to simulate a biological site size of 2 \u00b5m. The relative dose response function of this type of detector was calculated up to 20 MeV by Thomas (29). The ambient dose equivalentH*(10) was calculated as explained in Farah et al. (46). H*(10) value uncertainties are in the order of 15% when adding statistical (10%), alpha calibration (10%), extrapolation (2%), proton beam delivery (5%), and detector positioning (1%) uncertainties.\nA-6: RadEye NL The RadEye\u2122NL pager (Thermo Scientific\u2122) is a small, lightweight, and highly sensitive radiation detection device that incorporates a 3He counter filled at 2.5 bars to detect very low radiation levels of neutron radiation from any source. A polyethylene shell moderator, provided by Thermo Scientific\u2122 to improve the detection sensitivity, was used for these measurements. This moderator has a non-standard geometry (parallelepiped shape), which cannot ensure an isotropic response and limit its use as a neutron rem counter.\nThe response function of this detector was previously (28 studied using various types of reference sources (241Am-Be, bare and heavy water moderated 252Cf) as well as with several monoenergetic neutron fields available at the AMANDE facility (48). Hence, the variation of the response with neutron energy was determined at 8 keV, 27 keV, 144 keV, 250 keV, 565 keV, 1.2 MeV, 2.5 MeV, 5 MeV, and 15 MeV. The fluence reference values in the monoenergetic fields are established with an IRSN long counter traceable to national standards. The response of the RadEye\u2122 NL pager was found to be similar to leak design counters, overestimating the H*(10) values at the lowest energies and underestimating it at the highest energies. In this particular calibration, the response of the detector was set to unity for the 252Cf source while a 30% under-response is noticed for the 241Am-Be. It should be noticed, however, that the main limitation of this counter is the non-isotropic moderator geometry that induces a large angular dependence depending on neutron energy; namely, a factor of ~2 under-response was observed at 144 keV when comparing a 0\u00b0 front exposure of the moderator and a 90\u00b0 side exposure of the moderator; this underresponse drops to ~10% at 15 MeV.\nA-7: GW2 and REM-2 ionization chamber A research group from the National Centre for Nuclear Research, during the experiment, used unique gas detectors.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 13\nThe recombination chambers are ionization chambers designed in such a way that, at a certain range of gas pressure and dose rates, the initial recombination of ions dominates over the volume recombination, when the chamber operates at polarizing voltages below saturation. In the aspect of scientific research, they are excellent devices for comparing methods and results with popular, commercially available neutron detectors.\nThe REM-2 type detector is a large recombination chamber filled with a gas mixture consisting of 95% methane and 5% nitrogen up to a pressure of 10 atm. The gas volume is 1800 cm3. The detector is a cylinder with outer dimensions of about 30 cm height and 15 cm diameter. Inside the detector, there are 25 parallel-plate tissue-equivalent 3-mm-thick electrodes with 7 mm space between. The total mass of the detector is about 6.5 kg with an effective wall thickness of about 2 g/cm2. Because of the large volume, the detector is very sensitive (~2.63 \u00d7 106 Gy/C for Air Kerma Rate in the 137Cs isotopic radiation field). The device is a radiation sensor that allows one to determine radiation quality using the microdosimetric relationship between the initial recombination efficiency and local ion density. It has been proved (49, 50) that the recombination index of the radiation quality Q4 parameter is a good approximation of the Q(L) relation given in ICRP 60 (45). The main advantage of the chamber is the high compliance of the ambient dose equivalent at a depth of 10 mm H*(10) for ICRU spheres on a wide range neutron field energy spectrum from thermal up to 20 MeV and even further (30).\nThe tissue-equivalent REM-2 type detector and the nonhydrogen GW2-type gamma detector used in the experiment were placed side by side. The combination of hydrogen-free and tissue-equivalent detectors allows, independently from determining the radiation quality factor, the separation of the gamma and neutron components of mixed radiation (51, 52).\nThe GW2-type detector is an ionization chamber with aluminum electrodes and is filled with CO2 up to 26 atm pressure. Dimensions and number of electrodes are similar to the REM-2-type detector. Due to its construction, GW2 is almost insensitive to neutron radiation. In this experiment, the chamber had been used as a monitor for the gamma radiation component of the radiation field. The sensitivity of the detector is about ~9.58 \u00d7 106 Gy/C for Air Kerma Rate in the 137Cs isotopic radiation field.\nBefore the experiment, both detectors were calibrated with the 137Cs reference photon source and REM-2 was additionally checked against the radiation quality of the isotopic Am\u2013Be neutron field. The ambient dose equivalent H*(10) calculation was adopted following Tulik et al. (52). Determined uncertainties of H*(10) values are in the order of 25%.\nJuly 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 903706"
