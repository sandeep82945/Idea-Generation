    "abstractText": "Social media platforms provide actionable information during crises and pandemic outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a chronic public health crisis worldwide, with experts considering vaccines as the ultimate prevention to achieve herd immunity against the virus. A proportion of people may turn to social media platforms to oppose vaccines and vaccination, hindering government efforts to eradicate the virus. This paper presents the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination-specific global geotagged tweets dataset, GeoCovaxTweets, that contains more than 1.8 million tweets, with location information and longer temporal coverage, originating from 233 countries and territories between January 2020 and November 2022. The paper discusses the dataset\u2019s curation method and how it can be recreated locally, and later explores the dataset through multiple tweets distributions and briefly discusses its potential use cases. We anticipate that the dataset will assist the researchers in the crisis computing domain to explore the conversational dynamics of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination Twitter discourse through numerous spatial and temporal dimensions concerning trends, shifts in opinions, misinformation, and anti-vaccination campaigns.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, resulted in more than six million deaths cases and 600 million confirmed cases globally (Worldometer 2022). The respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 13, 2020, by World Health Organization. Vaccines such as Pfizer, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson, and Moderna were started in late 2020 to control the spread (WHO 2021). To acquire herd immunity to end the pandemic, it has been estimated that around 60-70% of the world population must get vaccinated (Aguas et al. 2022). However, one of the biggest hindrances to vaccinations is hesitancy in acceptance due to numerous reasons, importantly perceived fears.\nMyths and fears around vaccines are not new. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought vaccine hesitancy back to the limelight. Social media, which provides real-time access\n1https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YTH2MM\nto people\u2019s opinions and beliefs across demographics, has frequently been signified as a hotbed of activity for antivaccination activists (Kata 2012). These activists may turn to social media platforms to oppose vaccinations with claims lacking scientific support. Metaphors used to argue against vaccination revolve around negative phrases such as \u201cNo Forced Vaccines\u201d and \u201csay no to vaccines\u201d.\n(KFF 2022) reported that during February and March 2021, 40\u201347% of American adults were hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccinations. Previous studies have linked social media and the anti-vaccination movement towards vaccine hesitancy (Johnson et al. 2020; Burki 2019). The COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination-specific discussions on social media platforms have influenced people\u2019s decisions to accept or reject vaccination. Therefore, understanding the nature of vaccine hesitancy through publicly available social media discussions for different geographical regions can open interesting research avenues in the crisis computing domain. Numerous COVID-19-specific datasets have been released for studying the nature of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.\n(Chen et al. 2020; Lamsal 2021; Banda et al. 2021; Imran, Qazi, and Ofli 2022) are some of the pubicly available large-scale COVID-19 datasets that have hundreds of millions of tweets. However, those datasets vaguely focus on general COVID-19 discussions as their keyword sets are not entirely focused on vaccines and vaccination-specific discourse. Closely focused datasets have also been introduced (DeVerna et al. 2021; Muric et al. 2021; Malagoli et al. 2021); however, such datasets are either focused on a particular geographical region or have limited temporal coverage. To bridge these gaps, we present a large-scale geotagged tweets dataset, GeoCovaxTweets, containing vaccines and vaccination-related Twitter conversations with geolocation data. This dataset covers various perspectives on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination, as our keywords and hashtags set captures a comprehensive conversational dynamics of support, criticism, and hesitance towards the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination."

            "text": "Several researchers collect and share large-scale COVID-19 tweets datasets. (Chen et al. 2020; Banda et al. 2021; Lamsal 2021; Qazi, Imran, and Ofli 2020) provide large-scale tweet collections with different data distributions, collection peri-\nar X\niv :2\n30 1.\n07 37\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.S I]\n1 8\nJa n\n20 23\nods, and sets of keywords. (Chen et al. 2020; Banda et al. 2021) present multilingual datasets with 2.5 billion and 1.12 billion tweets respectively. Similarly, (Imran, Qazi, and Ofli 2022) has 2 billion multilingual tweets with the last release on March 2021. (Lamsal 2021) maintains an English-only collection with more than 2.2 billion tweets. The keywords sets differ amongst the datasets\u2014(Chen et al. 2020) use 80 keywords, (Banda et al. 2021) use 10 keywords, (Lamsal 2021) uses 90+ keywords, (Imran, Qazi, and Ofli 2022) use 800+ multilingual keywords. The data collection of (Chen et al. 2020; Banda et al. 2021; Lamsal 2021) is still ongoing. The common issue with these billion-scale datasets is that they are designed to capture the conversational dynamics of COVID-19 across every thematic area. In doing so, due to limits (per day upper limit and sample size) set by Twitter on its filtered stream endpoint, these datasets contain proportionately fewer theme-specific tweets compared to theme-dedicated collections.\nVaccines and vaccination-focused datasets have also been released. (Muric et al. 2021) presented a dataset of 137 million tweets having antivaccine discussions. The dataset includes tweets fetched through two complementary collections: first, using 60 keywords through streaming API, and second, collecting historical tweets from 70k accounts that allegedly propagated anti-vaccine tweets. (DeVerna et al. 2021) introduced a dataset of 4.7 million tweets that includes one week of vaccine-related tweets and also designed a dashboard to track and quantify credible information and misinformation records along with their sources and keywords. Another paper by (Hu et al. 2021) presented spatiotemporal trends from March 01, 2022, to February 08, 2022, toward COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. Similarly, vaccine hesitancy has been studied for Australia (Kwok, Vadde, and Wang 2021) and the globe (Chang, Monselise, and Yang 2021).\nHowever, the duration of these studies is either temporally-limited or mainly focuses on the pandemic\u2019s early stages. Hence, there is a need for critical work to explore the evolving nature of the public\u2019s perception of COVID-19 vaccines over an extended period. Additionally, most studies about COVID-19 vaccines are country specific with a significant focus on the United States.\nTo address the above gaps, we present a largescale COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination-related geotagged tweets dataset with a cross-national, extended timeline, and pro-anti-hesitant focus. We used Twitter\u2019s Fullarchive search endpoint to search and collect historical tweets; this endpoint returns 100% of Twitter data for a query+condition, unlike filtered and standard search endpoints, used by the majority of the studies discussed above, which return 1% of entire Twitter data at a particular time. We envision that the dataset will help the researchers in the crisis computing domain to analyze Twitter conversations for exploring the global spatio-temporal shifts and trends related to the COVID-19 vaccine narrative. We discuss potential use cases of the dataset later in the paper."

            "text": "We used the twarc python library to utilize Twitter\u2019s Fullarchive search endpoint. The endpoint returns all historical tweets, unlike the standard search endpoint which returns 1% of tweets at a particular time. To collect tweets relevant to COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination, we used meta-seed keywords having pro and anti-vaccine stances through a snowball sampling technique (Yang, Hui, and Menczer 2019). We started with the following seed keywords: CovidVaccineScam, NoForcedVaccines, covidvaccineVictims, BanCovidVaccine, getvaccinated, covishield affect, Covaxin affect, vaccineinjuries, NoForcedVaccination, vaccine, and vaccination. Moving on, we analyzed N -grams in the collected corpus every 10 minutes to track emerging relevant keywords, similar to the strategy applied in (Lamsal 2021). Furthermore, we refined the keyword list by identifying potential keywords that frequently co-occur with the seed keywords (DeVerna et al. 2021). We provide the complete set of keywords and hashtags used for curating GeoCovaxTweets in Table 1. Furthermore, we applied has:geo and lang:en conditional operators to collect only Englishlanguage tweets that are geotagged. The complete data curation process is illustrated in Figure 1.\nFor each collected tweet, we also provide state information besides country information. Although the geo.full name tweet object contains state information, some tweets had [city, state] or [state, country] information\u2014for instance, [Mumbai, Maharastra], and [Maharastra, India]\u2014 and therefore normalization was required for consistency. We set up a planet-level geocoding endpoint powered by OpenStreetMap2 data. The endpoint was backed with a search index of 61 gigabytes3 (when compressed) on a virtual machine with 24 VCPUs and 216 gigabytes of memory. The endpoint returned state information for each [city, state] or [state, country] request."

We release the following tweet objects in the dataset: id, created at, author.id, author.location, source, entities.hashtags, geo.country code, author.public metrics.followers count, and state. Twitter\u2019s data re-distribution policy4 restricts the sharing of raw Twitter data with third parties. Therefore, tweet identifiers (i.e., id tweet object) need to be hydrated to re-create the dataset locally. Hydration of tweet identifiers refers to the process of fetching raw tweet data using Twitter\u2019s tweet lookup endpoint. The lookup endpoint has a limit of 900 requests per 15-minute window; therefore, GeoCovaxTweets can be re-created locally within a few hours.\nTools such as Hydrator (desktop application) and twarc (Python library) can be used to hydrate the tweet identifiers\n2https://www.openstreetmap.org/ 3https://download1.graphhopper.com/public/ 4https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-\nand-policy\npresent in GeoCovaxTweets. In both use cases\u2014hydrating all the tweet identifiers in GeoCovaxTweets or a subset\u2014 tweet identifiers should be in a file (e.g., TXT/CSV) with each identifier on a different line without any header and quotes. With the Hydrator app, we need to link a Twitter account for authorization and load the file with tweet identifiers for starting hydration. In the case of twarc, we can use the following command:\nCommand: twarc2 hydrate --consumer-key consumer-key-here --consumer-secret consumer-secret-here --access-token access-token-here --access-tokensecret access-token-secret-here ids-file.txt data.jsonl\nThe above command hydrates the tweet identifiers in ids-file.txt and saves the API responses (hydrated data) in data.jsonl. Such hydrated data can be converted to CSV5 for loading the data as pandas dataframe for convenience.\nThe GeoCovaxTweets Dataset In this section, we briefly explore the GeoCovaxTweets dataset, present its potential use cases and provide additional information."

Figure 2 presents the daily\n5https://github.com/DocNow/twarc-csv\ndistribution of the tweets and the cumulative number of people vaccinated per hundred globally. The source of the vaccination data is Our World in Data6. Out of 1.8 million tweets, 899,592 (49.5%) are from United States, 263,765 (14.5%) from United Kingdom, 160,913 (8.8%) from India, 136,389 (7.5%) from Canada, and 65,951 (3.6%) from Australia. In Figure 3, we present the daily distribution of tweets in these five countries alongside their respective cumulative vaccination per hundred information.\nRegarding the statewide distribution, England, California, New York, Ontario, and Texas contribute the highest number of tweets. We also explored the different tweet sources in GeoCovaxTweets. Twitter\u2019s native application for iPhone, Android, and iPad apps are the top 3 sources contributing more than 1.7 million tweets. The list also includes Instagram and dlvr.it in the top 5 generating above 10k tweets. We provide the top 15 countries, states, and tweet sources with their respective frequencies in Table 2.\nWe explored the top n-grams in the vaccines and vaccination-related discourse. We removed noisy data such as URLs, retweet information, special characters, paragraph breaks, and stop words before extracting bigrams and trigrams. Table 3 list the top 15 bigrams and trigrams in GeoCovaxTweets. Similarly, we extracted the 15 toptweeted hashtags, which are as follows: #covid19, #vaccine, #getvaccinated, #vaccination, #covid, #covidvaccine, #vaccines, #vaccineswork, #coronavirus, #covid 19, #vaccinated, #pfizer, #wearamask, #covid19vaccine, and #astrazeneca.\n6https://ourworldindata.org/"

            "text": "GeoCovaxTweets covers a comprehensive conversational dynamics of support, criticism, and hesitance towards the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination on Twitter. There are several applications and potential usages of GeoCovaxtweets. We discuss some of them below:\n\u2022 Spatio-temporal analyses: The dataset can assist in examining how anti-vaccine discussions evolve spatially and tracking temporal relationships between vaccine intakes and social media discussions at the topical- and sentimental-level. The geotagged tweets can be explored to study vaccine hesitancy at the district-, city-, state- or country-level for hot-spot prediction and to get a precise view of how vaccine hesitancy impacts health outcomes. Although we provide state and country information, the dataset also contains tweets with point locations (i.e., geo coordinates) which can be filtered for performing spatial analyses at more granular levels than the state.\ncal data, particularly the origin locations of tweets, rather than the locations mentioned in tweet texts. Dependence on toponyms for spatial analyses can generate biased results due to the Location A/B problem (Lamsal, Harwood, and Read 2022a), as people in location A might participate in the discourse specific to location B. Instagram has been reported to generate the most COVID-19-related tweets geotagged with point coordinates, with the majority of them being throwback content, i.e., contexts from the past (Lamsal, Harwood, and Read 2022c), concluding that all geotagged tweets from Instagram might not necessarily be originating from the respective geotagged sources. Since, GeoCovaxTweets contains both types of geotagged tweets, i.e., point coordinates and place information (bounding box), training models (Lamsal, Harwood, and Read 2022c) for addressing the Location A/B problem can be another potential use case.\n\u2022 Downstream datasets: GeoCovaxTweets can be used\nto identify relevant tweets to generate labeled training datasets for fine-tuning language models for downstream tasks.\n\u2022 Network analysis: GeoCovaxTweets has application in network analysis, particularly for identifying key users or bots and their roles in spreading misinformation, hoaxes, and propaganda concerning COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination.\n\u2022 Correlation and causality: Correlation is a measure of computing the relationship between two variables. GeoCovaxTweets can be used to perform various types of correlation analysis\u2014such as the correlation between hesitant-type tweets and the number of vaccinations over a period of time. Geotagged tweets have been reported to have variables that granger cause time series such as the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases (Lamsal, Harwood, and Read 2022b). GeoCovaxTweets can be explored if support-, criticize-, and hesitant-type tweets Grangercause vaccination time series.\n\u2022 Dashboard: GeoCovaxTweets can also be used in webbased dashboards for visualizing situational data across different geographical contexts (DeVerna et al. 2021)."

            "heading": "Dataset Limitations",
            "text": "First, Twitter demographics are biased toward the younger generation and tech-aware users. Second, the dataset only includes English-language COVID-19 vaccine discourse missing the opinion of minority dialects and multilingual speakers (Jurgens, Tsvetkov, and Jurafsky 2017). Third, geotagged tweets are required for extracting situational awareness as they involve spatial analyses; however, today less than 1% of tweets are geotagged (Lamsal 2021). Hence our dataset may not fully reflect all of the Twitter users\u2019 conversations around the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination."

The\nexisting datasets either capture the conversational dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic across every thematic area and therefore include a proportionately lesser number of tweets regarding vaccines and vaccination or are geographically or temporally limited. By releasing GeoCovaxTweets to the public, we envision that the dataset will assist in exploring the global spatio-temporal shifts and trends related to the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination narratives."
