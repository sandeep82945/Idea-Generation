Expanding to Other Cryptographic Algorithms: The current study focuses on the AES-128 algorithm implemented on a Micro Controller Unit (MCU). Future research could explore the application of the 2F-FPCA method to other cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA, ECC, or different AES standards (e.g., AES-256), to assess its effectiveness across a broader spectrum of cryptographic systems. This expansion could provide insights into the versatility and adaptability of the 2F-FPCA method.

Exploring Advanced Filtering Techniques: While the paper introduces a secondary filtering approach for fault correlation analysis, further research could explore more advanced or alternative filtering techniques to enhance key recovery efficiency. This might involve machine learning models to predict POIs more accurately or new statistical methods to filter fault probability traces, aiming to reduce computational complexity and increase the success rate of attacks even in highly noisy environments.

Integration with Other Side-Channel Attack Forms: Combining the 2F-FPCA method with other forms of side-channel attacks, such as timing attacks, electromagnetic attacks, or differential power analysis (DPA), could offer a multidimensional approach to uncovering cryptographic keys. Research in this direction could investigate how different side-channel attack vectors can complement each other to improve overall efficacy.

Automating Attack Processes: Developing automated tools or frameworks that implement the 2F-FPCA method could significantly enhance its accessibility and efficiency. Such tools could automatically select POIs, perform fault injection, and analyze the results, thereby reducing the manual effort required and potentially uncovering vulnerabilities faster.

Countermeasure Development and Evaluation: With the introduction of the 2F-FPCA method and its demonstrated effectiveness, there's a need for developing new countermeasures to protect cryptographic devices against such attacks. Future research could focus on designing, implementing, and evaluating new hardware and software countermeasures that specifically address the vulnerabilities exposed by the 2F-FPCA method. This could include investigations into noise introduction techniques, fault detection mechanisms, or dynamic cryptographic operations that can adapt to detect and mitigate side-channel attacks.
