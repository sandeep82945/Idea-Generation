Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States\nGene delivery or manipulation with viral vectors is a frequently used tool in basic\nneuroscience studies. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are the most widely used\nvectors due to their relative safety and long-term efficacy without causing overt\nimmunological complications. Many AAV serotypes have been discovered and\nengineered that preferentially transduce different populations of neurons. However,\nefficient targeting of peripheral neurons remains challenging for many researchers,\nand evaluation of peripheral neuron transduction with AAVs in rats is limited. Here,\nwe aimed to test the efficiency of systemic AAVs to transduce peripheral neurons\nin rats. We administered AAV9-tdTomato, AAV-PHP.S-tdTomato, or AAV-retro-GFP\nsystemically to neonatal rats via intraperitoneal injection. After 5 weeks, we evaluated\nexpression patterns in peripheral sensory, motor, and autonomic neurons. No\nsignificant difference between the serotypes in the transduction of sensory neurons\nwas noted, and all serotypes were more efficient in transducing NF200 + neurons\ncompared to smaller CGRP + neurons. AAV-retro was more efficient at transducing\nmotor neurons compared to other serotypes. Moreover, PHP.S was more efficient at\ntransducing sympathetic neurons, and AAV-retro was more efficient at transducing\nparasympathetic neurons. These results indicate that specific AAV serotypes target\nperipheral neuron populations more efficiently than others in the neonatal rat.\nKEYWORDS\nautonomic nervous system (ANS), sensory nervous system, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), peripheral nervous system (PNS), AAV9, AAV-retro, PHP.S, Adeno Associated Virus (AAV)\nIntroduction\nRecombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are some of the most widely used viral vectors in basic research because of their long-term efficacy and lack of pathogenicity (Wang et al., 2019). Many different serotypes of AAVs have been either discovered or engineered for different cellular tropisms. Recently there have been improvements in peripheral neuron targeting with AAVs, however, challenges persist due to the anatomical spread of peripheral nerves (Chan et al., 2017; Bedbrook et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2022).\nSeveral AAV vectors have been used to transduce peripheral nerves, including AAV6, AAV8, AAV9, AAV-retro, and AAV-PHP.S (Wang et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2013; Gombash et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020). AAV9 has been used extensively to transduce cells of the sensory nervous system and has been proven more efficient than other\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org\nAAV serotypes when delivered systemically in mice (Gombash et al., 2014; Buckinx et al., 2016). AAV9 has also been effective at transducing motor, autonomic, and enteric neurons in mice (Benkhelifa-Ziyyat et al., 2013; Ayers et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2022). PHP.S, engineered from AAV9, has achieved even higher transduction efficacy in both sensory and autonomic nervous systems compared to AAV9 in adult C57Bl/6J mice (Chan et al., 2017; Asencor et al., 2021). AAV-retro has recently been used to transduce peripheral sensory neurons in mouse nodose ganglia (Zhao et al., 2022). Furthermore, AAV-retro efficiently transduces lower motor neurons in the mouse spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and trigeminal ganglia (Chen et al., 2020).\nIn the central nervous system, efficient delivery can be achieved by stereotaxic injection of viral vectors into the nucleus or brain area of interest by transducing cell bodies or nerve endings. In the peripheral nervous system, the nerve endings are more spread out, making efficient and repeatable retrograde targeting challenging (Hoyng et al., 2015; Bedbrook et al., 2018). Further, surgical access to peripheral neuron cell bodies is often more complex. One way to improve transduction efficiency throughout the peripheral nervous system is to use systemic delivery of viral vectors. In general, systemic delivery decreases the anatomical specificity of transduction but increases the number of neurons transduced (Duan, 2016). This technique, paired with Cre- or promotor-restricted expression, can be an effective way to transduce targeted peripheral neuron populations (Bedbrook et al., 2018; Haery et al., 2019).\nStudies involving the evaluation of peripheral nerve transduction by using systemic delivery of viral vectors are limited in rat models. While fewer transgenic tools are available, rats offer distinct advantages with their larger anatomy for physiology experiments and are often preferred in more advanced behavioral experiments (Ellenbroek and Youn, 2016). Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the systemic delivery of AAV vectors to the rat peripheral nervous system. We compare AAV9, PHP.S, and AAVretro in their ability to transduce autonomic, sensory, and motor peripheral neuron populations. We demonstrate that these vectors offer differing transduction efficacy depending on the peripheral nerve type."

We evaluated the lower urinary tract because it has innervation from sensory, parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatic motor peripheral neurons.

Exposure times when capturing images remained constant across images being directly compared. Six images of each animal were taken of different tissue sections for cell quantification in the dorsal root and pelvic ganglion. An experimenter performed all counts using the ImageJ Plugin Colocalization Object Counter (Lunde and Glover, 2020). This plugin allows the user to identify a threshold at which cells can be considered positively labeled in each channel, thus allowing us to determine if a cell is colocalized with viral transduction and a neuronal marker. For antibody staining of neuronal markers, we calculated the lowest noise tolerance that would not identify cells in our control images from the same animals as our experimental group but with no primary antibody. This threshold was determined for each channel that had antibody staining. Any cells with an intensity above this threshold in our experimental images were counted as positive using the colocalization object counter.\nFor virally transduced channels (Green florescent protein (GFP) or tdTomato), we drew a region of interest (ROI) around 3 experimenter identified non-labeled cells for each animal and then found the lowest noise tolerance (a variable in the Colocalization plugin) that would not identify cells. We calculated the average of these noise tolerances across the 3 ROIs from each animal. Then we\ncalculated a threshold (the average plus two standard deviations) to identify positively transduced cells. Cells above this threshold were considered positive by the semi-automatic counter, and each image was manually checked. Different thresholds were determined for each batch of antibody staining to account for variability between staining groups."

Dorsal root ganglia (sensory neurons) and pelvic ganglia (autonomic neurons) were stained with a pan-neuronal marker (Nissl or \u03b2-tubulin), and we evaluated the number of neuronal cells transduced with the fluorescent reporter (Figures 1, 2). The transduction efficiency of each virus was quantified by counting the number of Nissl + or \u03b2-tubulin + cells that co-expressed tdTomato or GFP in dorsal root ganglion and pelvic ganglion tissue sections (Figures 1D, 2D).\nWe found that all three viruses exhibited similar levels of neuronal transduction in L5-S1 dorsal root ganglion (PHP.S, 32.9 \u00b1 5.4%; AAV9, 25.4 \u00b1 5.5%; AAV-retro, 25.1 \u00b1 1.5%; ns), whereas dorsal root ganglion from vehicle-injected rats did not show expression in either fluorophore channel (Figures 1D\u2013F). Transduction rates were lower in the pelvic ganglion, with PHP.S transducing the most neurons (Figure 2). However, similar to the dorsal root ganglia, there was no statistical difference between PHP.S, AAV9, and AAV-retro in the transduction of pelvic ganglia neurons (PHP.S, 22.4 \u00b1 5.0%; AAV9, 12.0 \u00b1 4.1%; AAV-retro, 15.9 \u00b1 3.1%; ns)\n(Figure 2D). Pelvic ganglia taken from vehicle-injected rats did not express any signal in either fluorophore (Figures 2E, F).\nWe also investigated the different segments of the spinal cord to evaluate peripheral neuron transduction patterns of the neurons innervating the spinal cord. PHP.S and AAV9 groups exhibited similar transduction patterns, centralized to the dorsal horn, consistent with the sensory nerve fibers that innervate the spinal cord from dorsal root ganglion (Figures 3A, B). While AAVretro demonstrated similar expression as PHP.S and AAV9 in the dorsal horn, it also displayed robust GFP expression in the ventral horn and projections from these regions, which is consistent with motor neuron transduction (Figure 3C)."

Both PHP.S and AAV-retro groups had expression within the endothelial layer of the external urethral sphincter that colocalized with \u03b2-tubulin, confirming nerve fiber transduction lining the lumen, compared to vehicle-injected controls, which did not express any signal (Figure 5D). We also observed some non-neuronal transduction in the bladder (Figure 4B; white arrow).\nIn the pelvic ganglion, we classified transduced cells as either sympathetic neurons that co-stained with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or parasympathetic neurons that co-stained with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) (Figures 9, 10). AAV-retro showed significantly higher tropism for sympathetic neurons compared to PHP.S as quantified by the percentage of GFP + or tdTomato + neurons that expressed TH (34.8 \u00b1 3.7 vs. 4.9 \u00b1 3.1%, \u2217\u2217\u2217p = 0.0002) (Figure 9C). However, there was no statistical difference in the number TH + neurons transduced by AAVretro compared to PHP.S (22.3 \u00b1 3.6 vs. 8.8 \u00b1 5.1%, p = 0.0536) (Figure 9D). Consequently, AAV-retro transduced very few parasympathetic neurons; only 4.2 \u00b1 1.3% of GFP + neurons expressed nNOS. In PHP.S injected animals, 26.6 \u00b1 7.5% of tdTomato + neurons expressed nNOS. PHP.S showed a significant increase in transduced parasympathetic neurons compared to AAVretro (\u2217p = 0.0394) (Figure 10C). We also saw a significant difference between the percentage of nNOS + neurons transduced by PHP.S\ncompared to AAV-retro (21.0 \u00b1 3.6 vs. 0.7 \u00b1 0.4%, \u2217\u2217p = 0.0043) (Figure 10D). We compared antibody labeling to pelvic ganglia with no primary antibody staining (Figures 9E, 10E).\nClassification of transduced dorsal root ganglion neurons\nWe next sought to classify what types of sensory and autonomic neurons were transduced by PHP.S and AAV-retro. Due to the similarity of broad transduction of AAV9 and PHP.S, we chose only to compare PHP.S and AAV-retro. We used three markers to classify different neuronal populations: neurofilament 200 (NF200) for large, myelinated neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) for small, non-myelinated, peptidergic neurons, and isolectin-B4 (IB4) for small, non-myelinated, non-peptidergic neurons (Figures 6\u20138). Both PHP.S and AAV-retro showed similar tropism for NF200 + neurons, as quantified by the percentage of tdTomato + or GFP + neurons that expressed NF200 (21.5 \u00b1 3.9 vs. 21.1 \u00b1 2.9%, ns) (Figure 6C). We also saw no significant difference in the number of NF200 expressing neurons transduced by PHP.S or AAV-retro. The percentage of NF200-positive neurons transduced by the virus was significantly higher in the PHP.S group compared to the AAV-retro group (45.1 \u00b1 3.4 vs. 20.5 \u00b1 2.0%,\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 05 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 PHP.S, AAV9, and adeno-associated viruses (AAV)-retro transduce sensory neurons innervating the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, while only AAV-retro transduced neurons in the ventral horn.

            "text": "AAVs are widely used in basic science research for targeted genetic manipulation of specific neuronal populations. While there is extensive work evaluating the use of different AAV serotypes in the central nervous system (Foust et al., 2009; Jackson et al., 2015; Lukashchuk et al., 2016; Rincon et al., 2018), there are fewer studies assessing transduction of the peripheral nervous system (Wang et al., 2005; Zincarelli et al., 2008; Gombash et al., 2014; Buckinx et al., 2016) and even fewer in rats (Yu et al., 2013). We aimed to determine the transduction abilities of three AAV vectors\nin the rat peripheral nervous system: PHP.S, AAV9, and AAVretro. We did not observe an appreciable difference between the three viruses regarding the transduction efficiency in sensory or autonomic neuronal populations. However, there was a significant difference between the transduction of the parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic branches. AAV-retro transduced significantly more sympathetic neurons than PHP.S and significantly fewer parasympathetic neurons than PHP.S. Additionally, we found that AAV-retro was transducing spinal cord neurons in the ventral horn where motor neurons are located, which we did not see in the PHP.S or AAV9 groups.\nAAV-PHP.S was engineered from the AAV9 serotype to have higher transduction efficiency in the peripheral nervous system in adult mice (Chan et al., 2017). We investigated if this pattern would be consistent in rats. Our data revealed no significant difference between the engineered PHP.S and AAV9 when delivered systemically in neonatal rats. The discrepancy between mice and rats could be due to a species difference or related to the dose of viral\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 6 PHP.S and adeno-associated viruses (AAV)-retro transduce large, myelinated neurons at similar rates.

The original study comparing PHP.S to AAV9 used a much higher dose of virus (1 \u00d7 1012 vg/mouse) than we did (2.1 \u00d7 1011 vg/rat), so the increased efficiency of PHP.S may only occur at higher concentrations (Chan et al., 2017). Furthermore, we delivered the viruses in neonates, while Chan et al. delivered the viruses in adult animals. Developmental differences in transduction between P0 and P2 administration have been reported (Chakrabarty et al., 2013), while other studies have observed better transduction in neonates than in adults (Zheng et al., 2010), indicating that the developmental cycle may affect transduction efficiency.\nBoth PHP.S and AAV9 exhibit broad transduction of the peripheral nervous system and are viable options for rat model studies, but PHP.S does not seem to offer an appreciable increase in transduction compared to AAV9, despite being engineered for optimized performance. The same group that developed PHP.S recently published two new vectors: AAV-MaCPNS1 and AAVMaCPNS2 (Chen et al., 2022). These vectors have optimized peripheral transduction across multiple species and have better transduction in adult animals compared to AAV9 and PHP.S. Future work will need to evaluate the systemic delivery of these vectors to neonatal rats.\nRetrograde tracers such as AAV-retro enter the cell through axon terminals and travel to the cell body, labeling cells at the projection site (Xu et al., 2020). We evaluated AAV-retro delivered systemically in rats as it had been shown to broadly transduce motor neurons when given intramuscularly in mice (Chen et al., 2020). Although Chen et al. did not quantify expression in sensory neurons, they did observe extensive transduction of dorsal root ganglion neurons. This finding is similar to our results, which show high\ntransduction in the dorsal root ganglion of neonatal rats injected intraperitoneal.\nWe also found comparable transduction patterns in the spinal cord of AAV-retro injected rats as Chen et al. found in mice injected with AAV-retro intramuscular. AAV-retro exhibited robust transduction of spinal cord motor neurons, notably in the ventral horn, compared to other viral vectors, indicating that it has potential for studies targeting lower motor neurons. However, because Chen et al. delivered the virus into the forelimb on one side, they observed reduced transduction in the contralateral spinal cord, whereas we found relatively equal transduction on both sides.\nWe observed similar transduction patterns across the three groups in the dorsal horn, consistent with data collected from the transduction in the dorsal root ganglia. Furthermore, Chen et al. reported significantly higher spinal motor neuron transduction levels with AAV-retro than with AAV1, AAV2, and AAV5-AAV9 after intramuscular delivery in neonatal mice. Our data support these findings as AAV-retro also transduced neurons in the ventral horn; ventral horn transduction was absent with AAV9 or PHP.S. In contrast, other studies showed robust transduction of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord with AAV9 via systemic delivery to neonatal mice and rats (Foust et al., 2009; Jackson et al., 2015). Aside from species differences, the discrepancy could be explained by the amount of vector delivered to each animal. Jackson et al. found that an increased dose of AAV9 vector genomes led to higher transduction efficiency in adult mice than the lower dose initially used. This means that AAV9, AAV-retro, and possibly PHP.S have the potential to transduce lower motor neurons, but AAV-retro may be the preferred vector because it requires a lower dose.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 7 PHP.S and adeno-associated viruses (AAV)-retro transduce small, non-peptidergic neurons at similar rates.

PHP.S and AAV-retro transduced nerve fibers in the endothelial layer of the urethra, which are likely sensory fibers. All three viruses also transduced nerve fibers in the skeletal muscle of the external urethral sphincter. In the bladder, we found some non-neuronal transduction of an unconfirmed cell type. Future studies can focus on classifying the types of nerve fibers and cells transduced by these viruses in the external urethral sphincter and bladder. These results indicate that we may see off-target transduction when using systemic delivery, and this would need to be controlled for and considered when interpreting results.\nPromoters offer a way to select which cell types are being transduced. Because AAVs have such a small capsid, AAV-compatible promoters typically abbreviated to fit these viral vectors\u2019 packing capacity could be used (Gray et al., 2011; de Leeuw et al., 2014). However, this comes with the balance of expression level, as using a cell type-specific promoter may diminish this robust expression depending on the targeting promotor. Here we used the universal short CMV early enhancer/chicken \u03b2-actin (CAG) promoter to drive robust expression in all cell types.\nAdditionally, it is possible to place complementary microRNA binding sites into the vector genome to repress off-target transduction (Xie et al., 2011). Using Cre recombinase in tandem with AAVs has also provided another method of targeted gene transfer and a way to deliver Cre to adult animals (Ahmed et al., 2004). Cre-recombination-based AAV targeted evolution has led to engineered AAV capsids with higher tropism than the serotype they originated from, such as PHP.S, AAV-MaCPNS1, and AAVMaCPNS2 from AAV9 in mice (Deverman et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2022). Other viruses, such as lentivirus and HSV, have also been used for gene transfer studies because of their larger carrying capacity compared to AAVs and thus the ability to integrate large promotor sequences to gain specificity (Yu et al., 2011; Shimizu et al., 2017).\nAlthough the three viruses showed similar levels of transduction in the dorsal root ganglion, our immunohistochemistry classification studies revealed levels of tropism for different neuronal cell types (Figures 6\u20138). Although PHP.S and AAV-retro did not exhibit a significant difference in tropism for dorsal root ganglia neurons, they both transduced large, myelinated neurons more than small, nonmyelinated neurons (Figures 6\u20138). This data is supported by Skorput et al. (2022), who evaluated the mean size of somas being transduced by AAV-retro in dorsal root ganglia and saw that AAV-retro was transducing large-soma neurons. AAV9, which PHP.S was derived from, also transduces medium-to-large dorsal root ganglion neurons (Kubota et al., 2019).\nThere was no difference in the percentage of transduced neurons that were either CGRP + or NF200 + in PHP.S and AAV-retro groups. However, we did observe a significant increase in the percent of CGRP + and NF200 + neurons transduced by PHP.S compared to AAV-retro (Figures 6, 8). In other words, PHP.S transduced a greater population of the total CGRP + and NF200 + dorsal root ganglion cells. So while AAV-retro and PHP.S capsids broadly transduced the same proportions of CGRP + and NF200 + cells (\u223c10% of transduced neurons were CRGP + and \u223c20% of transduced neurons are NF200 +), PHP.s seems to transduce more of the CGRP (33.8 \u00b1 6.2 vs. 14.1 \u00b1 2.7%) and NF200 (45.1 \u00b1 3.4 vs. 20.5 \u00b1 2.0%) population. There was no statistical difference in overall transduction efficacy in the dorsal root ganglion comparing AAV9, PHP.S, and\nAAV-retro; PHP.S had the highest efficiency at \u223c32% compared to AAV-retro at \u223c25% (Figure 1). Altogether, these results indicate that PHP.s may have a better transduction efficiency in CGRP + and NF200 + cell populations.\nWe looked at viral transduction in the pelvic ganglion, which contains sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons innervating the lower urinary tract and other pelvic organs. We found that AAVretro preferentially transduces sympathetic neurons and almost no parasympathetic neurons. On the other hand, PHP.S transduced parasympathetic neurons more than sympathetic neurons and at a significantly higher rate than AAV-retro. These transduction patterns can be considered valuable tools in focused genetic manipulation of these autonomic neuron populations.\nIn terms of the limitations of this study, it is important to note that we were working with relatively small sample sizes. Due to the limited availability of animals, we could only sample five to seven animals for each group. This limited our ability to compare sex differences, which will be necessary for understanding the transduction profiles of the viral vectors. Future research should compare sex differences as well as different routes of systemic administration. Further, we did see variability within our groups. There are several potential reasons for this, including how much of the virus got systemically circulated from the intraperitoneal injection, whether some virus leaked out of the injection site following the injection observation period and potential variability in neonatal immune responses. Considering these variables and the variability we observed when designing future experiments using this technique is essential.\nIn summary, these AAV viruses can transduce peripheral neurons in rats. Although PHP.S was optimized from the AAV9 serotype for sensory neuron transduction in mice, our results indicate no advantage to using PHP.S over AAV9 in rats. Between AAV-retro, PHP.S, and AAV9, no one virus exhibits better transduction efficiency of sensory or autonomic populations. However, AAV-retro may have an edge when transducing motor neurons and neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. Additionally, PHP.S has an advantage when transducing parasympathetic neurons over AAV-retro."
