The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with afordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., for smart energy), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have started phasing. This workshop aims to demonstrate how web applications Apps can Web intelligence serve communities.",

Last year the workshop was held virtually in Lyon, France, in conjunction with \u201cThe Web Conference 2022\u201d. The workshop series aims to investigate the Web and Web applications\u2019 role in establishing the smart city (SC) promises for enhancing the quality of life in cities with the use of digital technologies.\nThis year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. In the era of cities and under the UN 2030 Agenda for sustainable growth, cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats [1; 2] and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with afordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., for smart energy), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have started phasing. This workshop aims to demonstrate how web applications Apps can Web intelligence serve communities.\nThis is a half-day event and consists of the following presentations:\n\u2022 Smart Cities as Hubs: a use case from Biotechnology \u2022 Towards High Resolution Urban Heat Analysis: Incorporating Thermal Drones to Enhance Satellite Based Urban Heatmaps\n\u2022 Towards a Sustainability Index Calculator for Smart Cities The call for articles attracted submissions from United States, Europe, and Africa. Review and acceptance statistics are as follows:\nWe believe that the program provides a good balance between several trending topics such as applications that strengthen coherence in cities. Hence, we hope that you will fnd the workshop\u2019s program interesting, providing you with a valuable opportunity to learn and share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world. An invited speech about smart city applications, will be presented in the beginning of the workshop.\n701"
