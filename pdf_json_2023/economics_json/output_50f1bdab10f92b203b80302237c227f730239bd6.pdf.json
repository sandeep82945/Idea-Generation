    "abstractText": "We explore the impacts of economic and financial dislocations caused by COVID-19 pandemic shocks on food sales in the United States from January 2020 to January 2021. We use the US weekly economic index (WEI) to measure economic dislocations and the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index (VIX) to capture the broader stock market dislocations. We validate the NARDL model by testing a battery of models using the autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL) methodology (ARDL, NARDL, and QARDL specifications). Our study postulates that an increase in WEI has a significant negative long-term effect on food sales, whereas a decrease in WEI has no statistically significant (long-run) effect. Thus, policy responses that ignore asymmetric effects and hidden cointegration may fail to promote food security during pandemics.",

In addition, the pandemic caused unprecedented global shocks to the regional and global economic systems. The magnitude of the economic shocks stems from globally synchronized lockdowns and serious financial system dislocations (see Apergis and Apergis 2021). Although the full effect of the pandemic is still unclear, our paper explores the effect of mitigation strategies (e.g., lockdowns and social distancing) and financial system shocks on the US food sales. Food sales are critical for ensuring food security. A better understanding is required to assess whether the pandemic has had a significant impact on the world\u2019s food supply chains (see World Bank 2020; IFPRI 2020), which can have a negative longterm effect on health due to insufficient nutrient intakes even in developed nations. According to recent research, economic disruptions resulted in lost income, which is a serious implication for food sales and security (Singh et\u00a0al. 2020). Economic disruptions are known to have triggered falling food sales and rising hunger and malnutrition\n*Correspondence: narasinghadas@gmail.com\n1 Economists for Peace and Security- Australia Chapter, Sydney, Australia 2 Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia\nin low-income countries, with no known effects on food sales in advanced economies (see Mogues 2020).\nThis study focuses on one of the most advanced economies, the United States, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We want to understand whether economic disruptions from the first wave of pandemic and shocks to financial markets, particularly the equity market, have compromised (short-run or long-run) food sales in the United States.1 To avoid misunderstanding, we explain the rationale for conserving food sales as a variable in the United States: in the United States, the primary public food assistance program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), seeks to protect the poor from food entitlement failures. The SNAP operates as an electronic benefit transfer that low-income people can use at retail food establishments. Hence, there is little reason to believe that the pandemic has increased food insecurity among the poor (those earning less than a certain level of income) who are covered by the public food assistance program. Similarly, there is an income threshold above in which food insecurity makes little sense since these people have the purchasing power to buy the required bundle of food items. However, the pandemic may have impacted food sales to those with intermediate incomes between these two income thresholds (lower and upper). Changes in retail food sales data can provide insight into the dynamics of food consumption of these people whose incomes are higher than the SNAP level but lower than the level that accords the full purchasing power for buying the desired bundles of food items, regardless of prices and/or economic and financial disruptions.\nSeveral authors, including Apergis and Apergis (2021), have argued that the pandemic has impacted financial markets (primarily stock and commodity markets), sending shockwaves throughout the economy.\nWe developed an autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL) model to capture both the short-run and long-run effects of the weekly economic index (WEI) and the weekly volatility index (VIX) on (weekly) food sales or food consumption (Z1).2 To capture hidden cointegration and asymmetric effects of economic and financial shocks on food sales, we then apply the nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) methodology.3 We further extend the analysis to determine whether the relationship between food sales and WEI and VIX varies across quantiles of the conditional distribution of food sales. For this purpose, we apply the QARDL model of Cho et\u00a0al. (2015) to uncover previously unknown aspects of the quantile-specific relationships between food sales and the economic consequences of\n1 We choose a simple indicator, or proxy, to measure the economic consequences of the pandemic mitigation strategy, or what is called lockdowns, during the initial phase of the outbreak of the pandemic in the US from January 2020 to January 2021: we use the US weekly economic index (WEI) as an indicator to gauge economic disruptions and supply shocks caused by the COVID-19 mitigation strategy in the United States. Further details are provided in Section\u00a0\"Variables and data\". 2 To avoid the trap of endogeneity between VIX and WEI, we choose the lagged value of VIX by a week: thus, VIX is not impacted by the future change in weekly activity index. We also checked the correlations between VIX and WEI and also a basic ARDL to ensure that the possibility of reverse causality from VIX to WEI is low. See Section\u00a0\"Baseline ARDL model\" of this paper. 3 Since the ARDL methodology assumes symmetric effects of changes in WEI and VIX on Z1, our ARDL model is unable to detect hidden cointegration\u2014characterised by asymmetric relationships between Z1 vis-\u00e0-vis positive and negative shocks in VIX and WEI. To overcome this weakness of our ARDL model, we will apply the nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) methodology that can detect hidden cointegration arising from asymmetric effects of positive and negative shocks in VIX and WEI on Z1. See Section\u00a0\"Nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model: an extension\" for full details.\nthe pandemic.4 We use the Bewley transformation as a robustness check to test whether endogeneity issues have compromised the estimation.5\nThe remainder of this paper is as follows. Section\u00a0\"Background literature and empirical strategy\" provides a brief review of the emerging literature and discusses the econometric methodology. Section\u00a0\"Results and discussion\" discusses the empirical findings and their implications. Finally, Section\u00a0\"Conclusion\" concludes the paper."

            "text": "Despite a series of severe economic disruptions, the US economy has several layers of protection in place to deal with the mounting challenges of the pandemic\u2019s economic and financial disruptions: First, one of the implicit insurances against the spillover effect of these disruptions to food consumption (or, food sales) is the ability of the US economy to resume economic growth, as highlighted in the context of US natural disasters by Anbarci et\u00a0al. (2005) and confirmed by Kellenberg and Mobarak (2008). Second, as Kahn (2005) and Toya and Skidmore (2007) discovered, the quality of institutions provides an effective barrier to the spread of disruptions and shocks throughout the economy. Third, with effective policy interventions, the short-term adverse effects of such disruptions can be avoided from becoming long-term problems. However, it is also understood that recovery is not always guaranteed (see Noy 2009; Cavallo et\u00a0al. 2013). The present study introduces the US WEI as a proxy for economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, several papers have used WEI to track the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Some of the key papers are Aprigliano et\u00a0al. (2022), Ashraf (2020), Baumeister et\u00a0al. (2022), Carriero et\u00a0al. (2022), Koop et\u00a0al. (2022), and Lewis et\u00a0al. (2021a, 2021b).\nSimilarly, as we will see in the following subsection, we use the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) VIX as a proxy for financial market disruptions. Our research is based on examining the relationship between food sales and the VIX and WEI."

If the postulated relationship is meaningfully heterogeneous across quantiles, then our findings NARDL will be untenable (see Section\u00a0\"Quantile autoregressive distributed lag model: fluctuations cointegrating relationships across quantiles\"). 5 The major weakness of the ARDL estimation is the potential endogeneity created by the lagged dependent variables. We apply the Bewley transformation to assess the relationship between food sales and other variables\u2014after controlling for potential endogeneity (see Section\u00a0 \"Endogeneity problems for the proposed models and insights from the Bewley transformation: a robustness check\").\ncommodity prices (Atri et\u00a0al. 2021). Since the 2008 financial crisis, the impacts of nonfundamentals, such as participants\u2019 expectations, anxiety, and market sentiments, on financial markets have been thoroughly examined (see Joo et\u00a0al. 2020). Baker et\u00a0al. (2016) also emphasized the role of policy uncertainty in influencing participants\u2019 beliefs, macroeconomic activities, and thus financial markets (Aloui et\u00a0al. 2016). Therefore, the increasing anxiety among investors in financial markets, resulted in rising \u201cinvestor fear,\u201d which is measured by the CBOE VIX. COVID-19\u2019s impact on food sales can be seen through its effect on VIX. This aspect has remained relatively unexplored despite its potentially devastating short- and long-term consequences for human security. We intend to fill this void by investigating potential nonlinear and asymmetric relationships between food sales and explanatory variables (WEI and VIX). It is critical to note that market sentiment can be measured using a volatility index derived from the GARCH model. Our results using the volatility index are roughly in conformity with CBOE indicator of VIX. Alternatively, the economic sentiment index developed by Shapiro et\u00a0 al. (2022) can be used to assess the news sentiment of the pandemic. Because our focus is not the news sentiment in this work, we choose not to use the economic sentiment index."

            "text": "The following summarizes the effects of economic disruptions on commodity markets during the pandemic: First, the outbreak lowered most commodity prices, particularly crude oil. For example, oil prices tumbled by two-thirds in the first quarter of 2020, a never-before-seen phenomenon. Such decreases have a wide-ranging impact on the cost of production for most goods and thus on the supply side. However, the demand side also plummeted due to COVID-19 containment measures, which caused a drop in economic activity. Thus, the pandemic caused a unique combination of disruptions in commodity markets, affecting both demand and supply (see Baffes et\u00a0al. 2020). According to Baffes et\u00a0al. (2020), disruptions in the food supply chain may have impacted food sales concerns and hoarding by consumers and speculators.\nSimultaneously, the pandemic disrupted agricultural commodity production due to shortages of key inputs, such as fertilizers, primarily due to mitigation measures. The labor movement across state and country borders was heavily regulated. Lockdowns also caused severe supply shocks in the food procuring industries. Moreover, trade restrictions exacerbated the food consumption problem (see Glauber et\u00a0al. 2020; Schmidhuber et\u00a0al. 2020; World Bank 2020)."

The WEI is an index of real economic activity\u2019s ten indicators that are scaled to correspond to the four-quarter GDP growth rate.

Following the extant literature, we know that the supply and demand shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have an impact on commodity markets, but the commodity market is also impounded by non-fundamentals such as participants\u2019 expectations (as discussed in Joo et\u00a0al. 2020; Baker et\u00a0al. 2016; Aloui et\u00a0al. 2016; Baumeister and Peersman 2013; Kilian 2009). The CBOE VIX is used to capture market expectations, whereas the US WEI is used to capture economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe CBOE VIX is a real-time market index issued by the CBOE as a volatility index to indicate the market\u2019s expectations for the relative strengths of near-term price changes (over the next 30\u00a0 days) (of the S&P 500 index (SPX)). Smales (2014) emphasized the importance of the VIX as a measure of investor fear. Thus, increases (decreases) in VIX indicate higher (lower) investor fear about the future. Hence, we use VIX as an indicator of the pandemic\u2019s long-term (economic) consequences. It is critical to note that the long-term in the context of a pandemic can be a few weeks due to potential upheavals in economic and financial situations caused by the pandemic. Meanwhile, WEI captures the short-run impacts of economic disruption caused by the pandemic.\nFor the food sales data, we use a weekly series released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA publishes the weekly retail food sales series, which is derived from proprietary scanner data using a nationally representative sample of retail food establishments collected by Information Resources Inc. [see https:// www. ers. usda. gov/ data- produ cts/ weekly- retail- food- sales/]. The USDA also publishes a volume index of retail food sales. We alternately use these two series as dependent variables as indicators of food sales. The N/ARDL and QARDL methodologies are used to detect the effects of VIX and WEI on Food Security (Z1) in the United States."

Note that \u03b5t is the error term and ln is the natural logarithmic transformation. The ARDL bounds test enables us to model both I (0) and I (1) variables together. The null hypotheses H0 posits: \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 0. As a result, the null hypothesis assumes that there is no cointegration, whereas the alternative hypothesis assumes that there is cointegration. As a result, the alternative hypothesis H1 proposes that at least one parameter I is not zero. Using the Wald test, the F-statistics will be calculated to compare with the critical values of Pesaran et\u00a0 al. (2001). The ARDL mechanism detects cointegration if the calculated F-statistics are greater than the upper bound of critical values.\n(1) LnZ1t = \u03b10 + \u03c0 LnZ1t\u22121 +\np\ni=1\n\u03b11i\ufffdLnVIX(t\u22121)\u2212i +\nq\ni=0\n\u03b12i\ufffdLnWEIt\u2212i\n+ \u03b21LnWEIt\u22121 + \u03b22LnVIX(t\u22121)\u22121 + \u03b5t\nNonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model: an\u00a0extension The evolving, albeit limited, literature on the pandemic\u2019s effects implicitly suggests that the effects of increases and decreases in pandemic-related variables (on other variables) are symmetric, with increases and decreases assumed to work along the same functional relationship (see Ashraf 2020; Apergis and Apergis 2021; Bakry et\u00a0al. 2021; Zaremba et\u00a0al. 2020). In section \u00a0\u201cBaseline ARDL model\u201d, the ARDL model follows the path of the existing work. In this\u00a0Section, we consider the possibility of asymmetric relationships between food sales (Z1) and the WEI and VIX. We contend that changes in the WEI and VIX can send specific messages to policymakers about the state of the economy and financial system, to which policymakers may respond asymmetrically. If there are any asymmetries, the symmetric models are incorrectly specified. As a result, we argue that a nonlinear and asymmetric error correction model based on a collection of (nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag) NARDL models will better capture the dependent variable\u2019s responses to various shocks in the independent variables of interest when these shocks have underlying asymmetric effects.\nTo avoid the ARDL model\u2019s potential technical inconsistencies, the analysis is performed using the NARDL approach described above. The NARDL model developed by Greenwood-Nimmo and Shin (2013) and Shin et\u00a0al. (2014) allows us to examine the short-run and long-run responses of Food sales (Z1) to asymmetric fluctuations in VIX, WEI. Furthermore, the NARDL model detects any hidden cointegration that other cointegration models fail to detect. Following the study\u2019s motivation, the following nonlinear and asymmetric NARDL model (ignoring short-run dynamics) was applied to the US economy:\nwhere Z1 is the chosen measure of food sales, WEI is the US weekly economic index, \u03b2+ is the long-run coefficient associated with an increase in WEI , WEI+t\u22121 , which coveys a message of further disruptions of the economy in our model. Similarly, WEI\u2212t\u22121 conveys the message that (mitigation) disruptions are likely to decrease. This method divides changes in an independent variable\u2019s values into positive ( +) and negative (-) partial sums, as shown below:\nNote, \u03b2\u2212 is the long-run coefficient associated with the negative change in WEIt\u22121 , WEI\u2212t\u22121 , which brings the message of decreases in future disruptions to the economy. Note that that \u03b2+ and \u03b2\u2212 are the positive partial sum and the negative partial sum of the increases and decreases in WEIt\u22121 , respectively. Similarly, we define the asymmetric change in VIX (t\u22121)\u22121 as a measure of financial market (investor) fear as follows: an\n(2a)Z1t = \u03b2+WEI+t\u22121 + \u03b2 \u2212WEI\u2212t\u22121 + \u03b8 +VIX+(t\u22121)\u22121 + \u03b8 \u2212VIX\u2212(t\u22121)\u22121 + \u00b5t\nWEIt = WEI0 +WEI + t +WEI \u2212 t , such that WEI + t =\nt\u2211\ni=1\n\ufffdWEI+i =\nt\u2211\ni=1\nmax (\ufffdWEIi, 0)\nand WEI\u2212t =\nt\u2211\ni=1\n\ufffdWEI\u2212i =\nt\u2211\ni=1\nmin (\ufffdWEIi, 0).\nincrease in VIX (t\u22121)\u22121 carries a message about the rise in future uncertainty, whereas a decrease in VIX (t\u22121)\u22121 indicates a decrease in investor fear.\nTo illustrate, consider how the unrestricted linear ARDL (p, q) model of Eq.\u00a0 (1) is reduced to the following nonlinear asymmetric conditional ARDL (Apergis and Gangopadhyay 2020):\nwhere \u2211q\u22121 i=0 b + i and \u2211q\u22121 i=0 b \u2212 i denote the short-run asymmetric dynamics of LnVIX(t\u22121)\u22121 , and \u03c9t labels the error term. The effects of positive and negative changes in LnVIX(t\u22121)\u22121 , and the asymmetric long-run coefficients of LnVIX(t\u22121)\u22121 , are calculated as \u03b8+ = \u2212 b +\n\u03c1 and \u03b8\u2212 = \u2212 b\n\u2212 \u03c1 .\n\u2211q\u22121 i=0 a + i and \u2211q\u22121 i=0 a \u2212 i denote the short-run asymmetric dynamics of LnWEIt\u22121 . The sums of positive and negative changes in LnWEIt\u22121 and the asymmetric long-run coefficients of LnWEAI are calculated as \u03b2+ = \u2212 a +\n\u03c1 and \u03b2\u2212 = \u2212 a\n\u2212 \u03c1 . Now, the error correction\nmodel of Eq.\u00a0(2b) can be presented as:\nQuantile autoregressive distributed lag model: fluctuations cointegrating relationships\nacross\u00a0quantiles Following Cho et\u00a0al. (2015), we proposed the QARDL model for the postulated ARDL model of (1) as follows:\nIn Eq.\u00a0(3a), et(v) = Q(\u0394LnZ1t) \u2212 \u0394LnZ1t\u2212i(v/Ft\u22121) and \u0394LnZ1t\u2212i(v/Ft\u22121) is the vth quantile of \u0394LnZ1t, and it is dependent on the Ft\u22121 information set.7 Now, incorporating the longrun dynamics into (1) the QARDL model can be written as follows:\n(2b)\n\ufffdLnZ1t = \u03b10 + \u03c1LnZ1t\u22121 + a +LnWEI+t\u22121 + a \u2212LnWEI\u2212t\u22121 + b +LnVIX+(t\u22121)\u22121\n+ b\u2212LnVIX\u2212(t\u22121)\u22121 +\np\u22121\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1i\ufffdLnZ1t\u2212i +\nq\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n(b+i \ufffdLnVIX + (t\u22121)\u2212i\n+ b\u2212i \ufffdLnVIX \u2212 (t\u22121)\u2212i)+\nq\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n(a+i \ufffdLnWEI + t\u2212i + b \u2212 i \ufffdLnWEI \u2212 t\u2212i)+ \u03c9t\n(2c)\n\ufffdLnZ1t =\np\u22121\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1i\ufffdLnZ1t\u2212i +\nq\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n(b+i \ufffdLnVIX + (t\u22121)\u2212i + b \u2212 i \ufffdLnVIX \u2212 (t\u22121)\u2212i)\n+\nq\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n(a+i \ufffdLnWEI + t\u2212i + b \u2212 i \ufffdLnWEI \u2212 t\u2212i)+i ECTt\u22121 + \u03c9t\n(3a)\nQ(\ufffdLnZ1t) = \u03c30(v)+\np\u22121\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b4i(v)\ufffdLnZ1t\u22121 +\nq1\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n\u03b1i(v)\ufffdVIX(t\u22121)\u22121\n+\nq2\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n\u03b2i(v)\ufffdWEIt\u22121 + et(v)\n7 See Kim and White (2003).\nEquation\u00a0 (3b), known as the QARDL error correction model (hereafter QARDLECM), posits the parameters of the short-run dynamics for food sales (LnZ1), LnVIX, and LnWEI, which are captured by \u03b4i(v), \u03b1i(v), and \u03b2i(v), respectively. Moreover, the corresponding long-run parameters are given by \u03c1VIX(v), \u03c9WEI(v). The cumulative short-run impacts of the independent variables can be calculated using the delta method: \u03b1i*(v) = \u2211q1\u22121\ni=0 \u03b1i (v), \u03b2i*(v) = \u2211q2\u22121 i=0 \u03b2i (v). Moreover, the long-run cointegrat-\ning coefficients can be assessed as \u03c1VIX*(v) = \u03c1VIX/\u03c0, \u03c9WEI*(v) = \u03c9WEI/\u03c0. The convergence speed toward equilibrium, which must be negative and significant, is given as \u03c0*(v). Following Cho et\u00a0al. (2015), we used the Wald test to statistically assess the regressors\u2019 short- and long-term nonlinear and asymmetric effects on the regressand (LnZ1). In this context, the null and alternative hypotheses for short-term dynamics are as follows:\nH0: S \u03b1i(v) = s against H1: S \u03b1i(v) \u2260 s; H0: S \u03b2i(v) = s against H1: S \u03b2i(v) \u2260 s;.\nFor the cumulative short-run effect, the null and alternative hypotheses can be.\n\u2022 H0: S \u03b1i*(v) = s against H1: S \u03b1i*(v) \u2260 s; \u2022 H0: S \u03b2i*(v) = s against H1: S \u03b2i*(v) \u2260 s;\nMeanwhile, for the long-run parameters and QARDL error correction term (ECT) terms (\u03c0(v)), the null and alternative hypothesis are as follows: \u03c1lnVIX(v), \u03c9lnWEI(v),\nH0: S \u03c1lnVIX*(v) = S (\u03c1lnVIXi/\u03c0) = s against H1:S \u03c1lnVIX*(v) = S (\u03c1lnVIXi/\u03c0) \u2260 s; H0: S \u03c9lnWEI*(v) = S (\u03c9lnWEI/\u03c0) = s against H1: S \u03c9lnWEI*(v) = S (\u03c9lnWEI/\u03c0) \u2260 s; H0: F \u03c0*(v) = f against H1: F \u03c0*(v) \u2260 f.\nHere, S and s, and F and f are pre-determined matrices with the h number of restrictions. The Wald test examined all of the nonlinear features of the parameters. The relevant null and alternative hypotheses for the speed of adjustment parameter \u03c0*(v), for example, are:\nH0: \u03c0*(0.25) = \u03c0*(0.50) = \u03c0*(0.75) = \u03c0*(0.95) and H1: \u03c0*(0.25) \u2260 \u03c0*(0.50) \u2260 \u03c0*(0.75) \u2260 \u03c0*(0.95) over the four quantiles Q25, Q50, Q75, and Q95.\nAs the independent variable moves from one quantile to another, QARDL allows us to establish a possible nonlinearity through a data-driven process. This method may be superior to Shin et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2014) nonlinear ARDL (NARDL), which exogenously\n(3b)\nQ(\ufffdLnZ1t) = \u03c30(v)+ \u03c0(v)LnZ1t\u22121 + \u03c1VIX (v)LnVIX(t\u22121)\u22121 + \u03c9WEI (v)LnWEIt\u22121\n+\np\u22121\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b4i(v)\ufffd LnZ1t\u22121 +\nq1\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n\u03b1i(v)\ufffdLnVIX(t\u22121)\u22121 +\nq2\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n\u03b2i(v)\ufffdLnWEIt\u22121 + et(v)\nbuilds nonlinearity by setting the quantile threshold to zero (see Apergis and Gangopadhyay 2020). Once (3b) is estimated, we can apply the Wald test to test the asymmetry hypothesis.\nEndogeneity problems for\u00a0the\u00a0proposed models and\u00a0insights from\u00a0the\u00a0Bewley transformation:\na\u00a0robustness check The problem of endogeneity has been noted in the context of ARDL. A simple transformation of the ARDL model known as the Bewley transformation allows for asymptotically valid inference while overcoming estimation issues due to endogeneity using t-statistics on long-run coefficients. This transformation provides an alternative method for estimating the cointegrating relationship, with certain finite sample advantages over the Engel\u2013Granger method. More information in the regression (in this case, via the Bewley transformation) is likely to produce estimators with better features, as simulations in Inder (1993) demonstrate.\nBy considering the ARDL (p, q) model from Eq.\u00a0(4a), the final form of the same equation under the Bewley transformation can be written as Eq.\u00a0(4b).\nBecause of the presence of a contemporaneous relationship between the variables in Eq.\u00a0(4b), the Bewley transformation necessitates the use of instrumental variables. Generally, Yt\u22121 is used as an instrument for Yt . In this study, we will use Stata\u2019s IVREG2 command to extract the Bewley transformation results and test the tenability of our ARDL model."

Third, none of the control variables have long-term relationships with food sales: we find clear evidence that VIX positively impacts food sales (Z1) at the 1% significance level. However, the effect of VIX on Z1 is inelastic: a 1% increase (decrease) in VIX, or a 1% increase (decrease) in investor fear, increases (decreases) food sales (Z1) by 0.12%. Moreover, WEI did not exert any statistically significant long-term impact on food sales (Z1). In the short-run, we find that \u2206LnZ1t\u22121 has a statistically significant and positive impact on \u2206LnZ1t, though inelastic, implying some sort of buyers\u2019 panic to hoard food items: a 1% increase in \u2206Z1t\u22121 increases \u2206Z1t by 0.34% and the effect is statistically significant at the 1% level. Finally, the proposed model is confirmed to have a long-run relationship, or cointegration, as evidenced by the bound test results provided by actual values of F_PSS in Table\u00a0 1. As previously discussed, the model establishes causality running from the model\u2019s explanatory variables to food sales, as evidenced by the error correction terms in Table\u00a01.\nSince the ARDL model assumes symmetric changes, it cannot detect asymmetric effects and, as a result, cannot detect hidden cointegration and nonlinearities. If there is hidden cointegration between food sales and the VIX and WEI, the ARDL model results are not credible. In what follows, we present the NARDL model results and find evidence of hidden cointegration, confirming that the baseline ARDL model results are not tenable.\nFindings from\u00a0the\u00a0NARDL model: is\u00a0there evidence of\u00a0hidden cointegration? Table\u00a0 2 shows that the positive partial sum of an increase in LnVIX ( \u03b8+ ) has a positive long-term effect on LnZ1 and is statistically significant at the 1% level. The effect is inelastic, implying a 1% increase in VIX\u2014ceteris paribus\u2014will increase Z1 by 0.27%.\nFurthermore, the negative partial sum of a decrease in VIX ( \u03b8\u2212 ) has a long-term negative effect on LnZ1 and is statistically significant at the 1% level. The effect is inelastic once more. We find that the value implies that a 1% decrease in VIX increases demand for food sales (Z1) by 0.085%. Thus, there is evidence of asymmetry for VIX\u2019s effect on Z1. In other words, there is evidence of hidden cointegration that the ARDL model failed to detect. However, the absolute values of the positive effect, \u03b8+ , is stronger than the corresponding values of the negative effects, or \u03b8\u2212 . The positive effect is approximately three (3) times greater than the negative effect, in absolute value. Thus, the effect of VIX increases outweigh the effect of VIX decreases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Wald test results (Table\u00a0 4) confirm the long-term asymmetries of both effects of \u03b8+ and \u03b8\u2212.\nTurning our attention to the asymmetric relationship between Z1 and WEI, we find that the positive partial sum of an increase in WEI ( \u03b2+ ), has a negative long-term effect on food sales (Z1) and is statistically significant at the 1% level. The inelastic effect implies that a 1% increase in WEI will reduce food sales (Z1) by 0.018%. Moreover, the negative partial sum of a reduction in WEI ( \u03b2\u2212 ) has no statistically significant effect on Z1. In other words, there is significant asymmetry in the positive effect ( \u03b2+ ) vis-\u00e0-vis the negative effect ( \u03b2\u2212 ) on food sales (Z1). The Wald test results (see Table\u00a04) confirm the long-term asymmetries of both effects of \u03b2+ and \u03b2\u2212.\nFor the short-term asymmetries, from the Wald test in Table\u00a04, we find evidence of statistically significant asymmetries for VIX. As VIX rose by 1%, food sales (Z1) declined by 0.34%, at the 1% significance level. However, as VIX decreased by 1%, food sales (Z1) declined by 0.18%, at the 1% significance level. We did not find any evidence of short-run asymmetries for the effects of WEI on food sales (Z1).\nThe adequacy of the dynamic specification is first assessed using a variety of diagnostics, including the Jarque\u2013Bera (J-B) statistic for error normality, the Portmanteau test statistic for model fit, the Breusch-Pagan test for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity up to order 2, and the Ramsey RESET statistics for regression specification error test. The results are shown in the lower panel of Table\u00a04. The models pass key diagnostics, indicating error normality, the absence of autocorrelation and the ARCH effect, and overall parameter stability. Accordingly, the dynamics of COVID-19 indicators are sufficiently specified.\nFinally, the postulated model is confirmed to have a long-run relationship, or cointegration, as evidenced by the bound test results provided by actual values of F_PSS in Table\u00a0 2. As previously discussed, the model establishes causality running from the model\u2019s explanatory variables to food sales, as indicated by the ECT in Table\u00a02. The presence of hidden cointegration, as confirmed by the asymmetric effects of VIX and WEI on LnZ1, renders the ARDL findings untenable, while the NARDL model results are meaningful. In what follows, we apply the QARDL model to test the robustness of the NARDL model. One of the NARDL model\u2019s central assumptions is that the coefficients remained stable across quantiles. The tenability of the NARDL model breaks down when coefficients fluctuate from one quantile to another. In the following subsection, the QARDL model will test the robustness of the NARDL model.\nFindings from\u00a0the\u00a0QARDL model to\u00a0test fluctuations of\u00a0coefficients across\u00a0quantiles:\nrobustness check of\u00a0NARDL model We estimated the model using four quantiles (Q25, Q50, Q75, and Q95). The speed of adjustment parameter \u03c0* is not only negative but also significant across the four quantiles, indicating the presence of long-run cointegrating relationships. This demonstrates that long-run cointegrating relationships are valid with both basic ARDL estimation and the QARDL model.\nThe long-run coefficients of the VIX index [\u03c1VIX* (v)] have significant positive impacts on food units sold [Z1] in the 0.95 quantile, whereas weekly economic activity [\u03c9WEI* (v)] has insignificant impact across the quantiles.\nThe short-run parameters show that, among the regressors, the lag difference of food sales [\ua77a \u03b41(v)], VIX [\ua77a \u03b10(v)], and WEI [\ua77a \u03b22 (v)] exhibits a significant positive effect on food sales only in the fourth quantile [v = 0.95].\nWe discovered that the constant term [\u03c3*(v)] is significant across all four quantiles. Figure\u00a02 shows a graphical representation of the results.\nWald tests for null of linearity were performed to test for the consistency of parameter estimates across quantiles, and the results are shown in Table\u00a03. For the speed of adjustment parameter \u03c0*, the p value of 0.418 shows that the null of linearity cannot be rejected, confirming that the parameter is consistent across quantiles. This conclusion is reached with the remaining parameters in both the long and short runs.\nAfter applying the QARDL methodology for the same relationship between food sales and the control variables, we find important insights into the long-run relationships across various quantiles, that is, contingent on the conditional distribution of the dependent variables. It is important to note that the QARDL model findings do not support the NARDL model findings, but the Wald tests of the QARDL model show no evidence of parameter fluctuations or fluctuations in cointegration across quantiles. Thus, the NARDL model is robust.\nTable\u00a03 shows that the error correction terms across quantiles are negative and significant for all QARDL model quantiles. Hence, for all quantiles of the dependent variable, the causality runs from the chosen variables (WEI and VIX) to food sales (Z1). This is an important finding because both ARDL and NARDL results showed that causality runs from the selected variables to food sales at the 1% significance level. Thus, the unbundling of the relationship across quantiles\u2014using the QARDL methodology\u2014confirms the NARDL models\u2019 causality findings for all quantiles."

First, we avoided concurrent movements in WEI and VIX by delaying the VIX variable by one week. As a result, unknown future WEI values do not affect current or historical VIX values. Second, we checked the correlation between WEI and VIX (lagged by a year), and the correlation is in the safe zone. Finally, we check the reverse causality of VIX (expectations about the future) on current and future WEI. Then, we ran the ARDL estimation and found the absence of any long-run causality running from VIX to (future) WEI.\nThis subsection addresses the additional endogeneity problem by estimating the postulated model\u2019s Bewley equation using the ARDL instrumental variable (IV). This will allow us to determine whether the proposed ARDL models are robust in extracting short and long-run relationships by using the lag of the dependent variable as the independent variable (Stu\u010dka 2004). The Bewley transformation allows us to find whether a change in the ARDL model\u2019s dependent variable should correlate with any of the variables in question (see Inder 1993).\nThis transformation methodology uses the lagged dependent variable as the instrument. Tables\u00a05 and 6 summarize the results of the instrumental variable regression using the IVREG2 command of Stata. Our findings are two-fold:\n(i) As shown in Table\u00a06, the Cragg\u2013Donald Wald F statistic is greater than the Stock\u2013 Yogo weak ID test critical values. Hence, the instrument of the Bewley transformation is valid.\n(ii) Z1 bears a (statistically significant) positive relationship with VIX (Table\u00a06). Thus, increases (decreases) in the financial uncertainty, or disruptions, will increase (decrease) food sales (Z1). We find a positive relationship between Z1 and WEI, but it is not statistically significant. Note that the relationship between WEI and Z1 is expected to hold because these are concurrent movements within the same week. WEI is likely to take a little longer to influence food sales Z1. Thus, once the Bewley transformation controls the potential endogeneity, there is clear evidence that financial market disruptions or the VIX impacts food sales. After controlling for\nendogeneity, we determined that economic disruptions have no statistically significant effect on food sales in the same week. The standard ARDL results confirmed this. Hence, our identification strategy to lag VIX effectively avoids the endogeneity trap."

            "text": "One of our analysis\u2019s obvious flaws is that the direct effect of the pandemic on food sales cannot be clinically separated from the indirect effect of the pandemic due to economic dislocations.8 We tested the addition of a variable to capture pandemic intensity as an additional regressor. However, as highlighted in the literature, any attempt to capture the intensity of the pandemic will create serious estimation problems. Our model\u2019s apparent weakness stems from one of the primary requirements of any variant of the ARDL methodology: the regressors are truly exogenous (see Cho et\u00a0al. 2021, p. 1). It is wellrecognized that a large number of studies have ignored this key requirement and drawn incorrect conclusions. Sam et\u00a0al. (2019) succinctly argued that \u201cHowever, as pointed out by McNown et\u00a0 al. (2018), these assumptions were sometimes ignored by researchers, possibly leading to misleading conclusions\u201d (p. 130).\nIn all ARDL variants, including ARDL, NARDL, QARDL models, and other extensions, the explanatory variables must be exogenous; hence, we chose our model after carefully checking that the chosen explanatory variables are exogenous. To assess the feasibility of incorporating the pandemic variable, we chose a variable XPandemic, defined as the weekly COVID-19 infection rate, as a possible explanatory variable to capture the intensity of the pandemic in the United States.\nThe results from a vector autoregressive (VAR) model establishes that XPandemic cannot be used simultaneously with WEI due to endogeneity problems, as highlighted by Cho et\u00a0al. (2021). Table\u00a09 in the appendix confirms that WEI and VIX can be used safely as exogenous explanatory variables. However, including XPandemic in the ARDL methodology will lead to incorrect estimation. Several other pandemic-related variables were investigated. We found that none of them can be used with WEI and VIX without violating the requirement of exogenous explanatory variables.\nHowever, the cost of this weakness in the ARDL methodology is relatively minor, if not non-existent. As shown in Table\u00a010 in the appendix, XPandemic (from ARDL results after dropping WEI) has no cointegration with, or causal effect, on Food Sales (Z1) based on the bound test results. Hence, the results of our paper, which are based on several variants of the ARDL methodology, are robust because they have little weakness from the failure to separate the overall effect of the pandemic into direct and indirect effects (via WEI).\nTherefore, we can say that the COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented shocks in global economic and financial markets. The collapse of economic and financial markets created downside risks. Because downside risks are a major concern in asset pricing and\n8 We are grateful to one of our referees for raising this inseparability of direct and indirect effects.\ncorporate finance, several important papers in finance have investigated this issue (see Wen et\u00a0al. 2019). Traditionally, during an economic and financial turmoil, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, downside risk is measured by stock price crash risk. This risk, which will have long-term negative effects on the development of the capital market and economic growth, will jeopardize shareholder value. The problem is exacerbated by managers\u2019 incentives to send biased signals to investors by withholding information (see Jin and Myers 2006). Firm-specific shocks do not emerge until a critical point and, more often than not, trigger a crash when the information becomes public (see, Habib et\u00a0al. 2018; Callen and Fang 2013; Hutton et\u00a0al. 2009).9 Note that the COVID-19 pandemic sent shockwaves through the entire economy, leaving little room for information asymmetry. Even if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the pandemic has created information asymmetry, retail investor attention can mitigate the problem of information withholding and asymmetry, as highlighted by Gao et\u00a0 al. (2018). According to Gao et\u00a0al. (2018), retail investor attention can help overcome the problem of information withholding caused by asymmetric information because individual investors can glean information about a company from retail investor attention. Additional signals, such as retail investor attention, can help mitigate the asymmetric information problem (see Ding and Hou 2015). Consequently, the severity of crash becomes much less pronounced with retail investor attention.\nThe pandemic also caused significant changes in buyer behavior, particularly for food items, which can pose significant risks (see Li et\u00a0al. 2022). Li et\u00a0al. (2022) emphasized the emergence of market and financial risks due to changing buyer behavior. Li et\u00a0al. (2022) have highlighted clustering in this context to better understand the role of unknown sub-patterns in data aggregation in local areas. Our focus on the US food market, rather than the global market or aggregate consumer spending, stems from the need for data aggregation in local areas.\nDuring the pandemic, decision-making problems have become complex processes even for households. As Kou et\u00a0al. (2021) highlighted, there is a need to develop more accurate and effective results for any complex decision-making problem. In this paper, we develop a quantile dependence structure as a more accurate model to explore food purchasing patterns across quantiles during unprecedented downside risks."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "From the baseline ARDL model, we find that the US food sales (Z1), during the first phase of the pandemic, had a long-run relationship (or cointegration) with both VIX and WEI and the causality runs from VIX and WEI to Z1. The baseline ARDL model suggests that VIX impacted Z1; however, there is no evidence that WEI had any statistically significant effect on Z1. To avoid the potential endogeneity between VIX and WEI, we have used the lagged value of VIX by a week in the regressions. We also used the Bewley transformation to overcome endogeneity problems. As a result, economic disruptions\n9 The extant literature considered various factors responsible for the severity of stock price crash risk: as examples, opaque financial reports (Hutton et\u00a0al. 2009; Kim and Zhang 2014), corporate tax avoidance (Kim et\u00a0al. 2011b), CFO equity incentives (Kim et\u00a0al. 2011a), analyst optimism (Xu et\u00a0al. 2013), institutional investor stability (Callen and Fang 2013), corporate social responsibility (Kim et\u00a0al. 2014), religion (Callen and Fang 2015), CEO overconfidence (Kim et\u00a0al. 2016), and social trust (Li et\u00a0al. 2017).\ncaused by mitigation strategies did not reduce US food consumption on its own. We find that investor apprehension, or fear, in financial markets (VIX), spilled over to US food market sales: ceteris paribus, a 1% increase in VIX (rising investor anxiety) increased weekly food sales by 0.12% in the long-run. The ARDL methodology assumes that this effect is symmetric: a 1% decrease in VIX reduces weekly food sales by 0.12%. The Bewley transformation estimation confirmed the ARDL findings.\nAs a robustness check, we used the nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) methodology to test the ARDL findings\u2019 robustness by capturing the asymmetric effects of WEI and VIX on Z1. The NARDL results revealed a hidden cointegration, or long-run relationship, between Z1 and changes in WEI and VIX. Hence, the ARDL model results are found to be untenable. Using the NARDL methodology, we discovered significant long-run and short-run asymmetries: increases in WEI have adverse long-run effect on food sales, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. However, reductions in WEI had no statistically significant (long-run) effect on food sales. Thus, there is no evidence of food insecurity in the United States due to COVID-19 economic disruptions. We found that a 1% increase in the VIX, indicating increased investor fear, increased food sales by 0.27% in the long-run. This rise, driven by rising investor fear, could be explained as speculative hoarding/panic buying by buyers. By contrast, a 1% drop in the VIX resulted in a 0.088% increase in (long-run) food sales. Thus, there is no evidence that any positive or negative shocks to financial markets have harmed food sales in the United States in the long-run. Although increases (decreases) in VIX reduced (increased) food sales in the short-run, fluctuations in WEI had no statistically significant (asymmetric) effects on food sales.\nWhen applying the QARDL methodology for testing the tenability of NARDL results, we find that the cointegrating coefficients in the long-run relationship between food sales and regressors have some fluctuations across different quantiles. However, except for the top quantile, the effects are not statistically significant. Thus, the NARDL results are robust when we consider the possibility of fluctuations in the postulated cointegrating relationship across quantiles. Therefore, despite nontrivial COVID-19-induced economic and financial disruptions, we conclude that US food sales remained relatively immune to such massive economic and financial disruptions."
