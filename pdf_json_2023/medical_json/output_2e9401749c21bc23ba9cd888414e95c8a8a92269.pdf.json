Suppression of cortical activity is a key feature of the anesthetic-induced unconscious state, with activity being a well-described regulator of pathways important for brain health. However, the extent to which the effects of anesthesia go beyond simple suppression of neuronal activity is incompletely understood.We found that general anesthesia lowered cortical expression of genes induced by physiological activity in vivo, and recapitulated additional patterns of gene regulation induced by total blockade of firing activity in vitro, including repression of neuroprotective genes and induction of pro-apoptotic genes. However, the influence of anesthesia extended beyond that which could be accounted for by activity modulation, including the induction of non activityregulated genes associated with inflammation and cell death. We next focused on astrocytes, important integrators of both neuronal activity and inflammatory signaling. General anesthesia triggered gene expression changes consistent with astrocytes being in a low-activity environment, but additionally caused induction of a reactive profile, with transcriptional changes enriched in those triggered by stroke, neuroinflammation, and A\u00df/tau pathology. Thus, while the effects of general anesthesia on cortical gene expression are consistent with the strong repression of brain activity, further deleterious effects are apparent including a reactive astrocyte profile.\nKEYWORDS\ngeneral anesthesia, transcriptional regulation, synaptic activity, astrocytes, neurodegenerating diseases\nIntroduction\nGeneral anesthesia (GA) is a common clinical intervention, with nearly 230 million surgical procedures taking place under GA across the world every year (Weiser et al., 2008). Exposure to anesthetic agents has been implicated in increasing neuronal apoptosis (Yon et al., 2005), worsening dementia neuropathology (Xie et al., 2008), increasing perioperative delirium (Robinson and Eiseman, 2008) and driving short and"

However, the molecular pathways by which anesthesia induces these deleterious effects is unclear.\nAlthough the exact mechanisms by which GA agents work are yet to be fully elucidated, they are widely considered to suppress neuronal firing (Ries and Puil, 1993) via GABA receptor agonism or NMDA receptor antagonism (Chung et al., 2021). Anesthesia induces burst suppression on EEG (Lukatch et al., 2005), with both acute and long-lasting exposure to anesthesia being shown to dysregulate expression of selected activity-regulated immediate early genes (Upton et al., 2020). GA agents also have wider consequences on the CNS beyond those only through modulation of neuronal firing. They bind alternative non-GABA or non-NMDA receptors (Son, 2010); have global membrane effects via action on lipid-rafts (Pavel et al., 2020) and alter CNS blood flow (Slupe and Kirsch, 2018). Previous work by ourselves and others has established that neuronal activity is a key regulator of CNS transcription, driving cellular and circuitlevel changes necessary for memory and neuronal health (Bell and Hardingham, 2011; Deighton et al., 2014; Baxter et al., 2015; Hasel et al., 2017). However the extent to which anesthesia alters activity-regulated pathways important for brain health, as well as consequences on non-activity dependent pathways, was undetermined.\nBeyond altering neuronal transcription, neuronal activity also has consequences on gene expression in nearby nonneuronal cells. Previously, we found that neuronal activity altered transcription in astrocytes (Hasel et al., 2017), the most common non-neuronal cell in the brain. These cells play important roles for CNS function including glutamate clearance (Anderson and Swanson, 2000), ionic regulation (Hertz and Chen, 2016), metabolic (Weber and Barros, 2015; Hasel et al., 2017) and antioxidant homeostasis (Jiwaji and Hardingham, 2022). We determined that neuronal activity upregulated astrocyte glycolytic gene expression, hence increasing the capacity of astrocytes to provide metabolic support to neurons (Hasel et al., 2017). However, the extent to which neuronal activity regulates astrocyte transcription in vivo, and whether anesthesia, by suppressing neuronal firing, altered previously identified astrocyte activity-dependent homeostatic pathways was unknown. Furthermore, astrocytes express GABA receptors (Chung et al., 2021) and anesthesia directly alters astrocyte calcium signaling (Thrane et al., 2012), lactate production (Hadjihambi et al., 2020), and gap junction formation (Liu et al., 2016). However, the extent to which anesthesia (via activity-dependent or activity-independent pathways) alters astrocyte transcriptional pathways was unknown.\nIn this study, we aimed to determine how anesthesia alters CNS and astrocyte transcriptional pathways. As anesthesia is associated with deleterious consequences, we aimed to identify consequences on CNS and astrocyte transcriptional pathways important for brain health. In addition, we aimed to identify the extent to which anesthesia-mediated gene expression changes overlapped with effects mediated through neuronal activity suppression vs. activity-independent effects in a whole brain situation."

Following washing, cortices were mechanically dissociated with repeated mixing using a 5 mL serological pipette and the resulting cell-suspension diluted with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with glucose (20 mM) and Antimicrobial-Antifungal to achieve a final tissue concentration of 0.14 mouse cortical hemispheres.\n0.5 mL of cell suspension was added to 24-well tissue-culture plates pre-coated with 0.5 mL of water with 0.5% laminin from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma cells (Roche) and 1.33% poly-D-lysine (Sigma). Plates were incubated for 2.5 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After this, plate medium was aspirated (along with dead or non-adherent cells) and replaced 1 mL Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with 1% rat serum, B27, Antimicrobial-Antifungal and glutamine and 4.3 \u03bcM of the antimitotic cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside hydrochloride (AraC) to prevent glial growth. Cultures were subsequently fed at day in vitro (DIV) 4 with 1 mL of Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with 1% rat serum, B-27, Anti-Anti, glutamine and AraC.\nSuppression of synaptic activity was achieved by changing cultured cells into serum-free base-medium (10% minimum essential media (MEM, Life Technologies) and 90% salt\u2013glucose\u2013glycine (SGG) containing in mM: 114NaCl, NaHCO3, 5.292KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10HEPES, 1Glycine, 30Glucose, 0.5 sodium pyruvate, 0.1% Phenol Red) with 100 nM tetradotoxin (TTX, Tocris) on DIV9 for 24 h to inhibit neuronal action potential firing.

General anesthesia alters a large programme of cortical transcription and suppresses known activity-regulated immediate early genes.\nWe first set out to define how general anesthesia altered cortical transcription. Mice were exposed to 6 h isoflurane anesthesia, following which neocortices were dissected for RNA extraction and gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing (RNAseq). Differential gene expression analysis revealed that anesthesia altered the expression of hundreds of CNS genes (Figure 1A; Supplementary Data S2-1). Ontology analysis of upregulated and downregulated genes (Figure 1B) highlighted anesthesia-associated upregulation of deleterious pathways including those for mitochondrial stress responses associated with apoptosis through\nrelease of cytochrome C (Hrk, Bid, Bbc3, Pmaip1, Plaur, Fas, Bmf) and inflammation-induced responses including lipoxygenase synthesis (Alox12b, Aloxe3, Alox8, Pla2g3) and chemokine production (Il4ra, Oas1c, Ticam1, Cyr61, Havcr2, Tlr7, Alox8, Trpv4). Important pathways downregulated included those involved in the control of vasculature (Apln, Arhgap42, Cx3cl1, Ahr, Dock5, Dusp5) and neural maturation (Bcl2, Dleu2, Lrrk2, Mir212, Mir132, Ngf) and differentiation (Bdnf, Notch1, Hdac5, Tmem119).\nThe mechanism of action for most anesthesia agents is considered to be via inhibition of neuronal firing by GABA activation and NMDA receptor inhibition. We therefore investigated the consequences of anesthesia on immediate early genes previously described to be upregulated by neuronal firing (Lin et al., 2008; Lacar et al., 2016). We found that anesthesia is a potent suppressor of immediate early genes including downregulating activity-regulated genes that have previously been described to have neuroprotective or pro-synaptogenesis properties (Bdnf, Arc, Npas4, Homer) (Lin et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2018; Pollina et al., 2023) (Figure 1C, qPCR validation of selected IEGs in Supplementary Figure S11).\n2. Visual sensory-deprivation and light re-exposure stimulation to determine CNS activity-regulated genes.\nNeuronal firing is a key regulator of CNS transcription (Papadia et al., 2008; L\u00e9veill\u00e9 et al., 2010; Bell and Hardingham, 2011; Baxter et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2020). Having identified that anesthesia suppresses a limited set of markers previously described to be associated with neuronal firing, we next set out to determine more completely the extent to which anesthesia alters the expression of genes that are controlled by neuronal activity.\nTo better define CNS genes regulated in vivo by neuronal activity, we used a visual sensory deprivation and light-exposure paradigm. This allowed us to create conditions of altered neuronal activity in the visual cortex (Figure 2A). Mice were kept in complete darkness for 7 days to suppress visual cortex neuronal activity, and gene expression changes were compared tomice kept in normal light\nTABLE 1 Primer sequences.\nGene Forward (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) Reverse (5\u2032\u20133\u2032)\nAif1 GCAATGATGAGGATCTGCC CCACTGGACACCTCTCTAATTAATC\nAldh1l1 GTTGCTAGCCCAGAGCC GGAACTTAAACACGGGCAC\nArc AGTGGTGGGAGTTCAAGCAG TCCTCAGCGTCCACATACAG\nBdnf AAAGTCCCGGTATCCAAAGG CTTATGAATCGCCAGCCAAT\nCx3cr1 CTGGTGGTCTTTGCCTTC GCACTTCCTATACAGGTGTCC\nEno2 GCCATCTCCTGTAACTCTCC ATTCTGTAAAGTTCCGAGCTTC\nGfap GCAAAAGCACCAAAGAAGGGGA ACATGGTTCAGTCCCTTAGAGG\nMbp CCAGTCTAATAATGTCCATCGAC CAGATTAACAAGATGCAGTATTGG\nMog AAAGAATACCGACCAGAGAAATAC CACATTGGTTCTCAGAGAAATAAG\nNpy AGACCTCTTAATGAAGGAAAGCAC CAGGCAGACTGGTTTCAGG\nRpl13a GATGAATACCAACCCCTCC CGAACAACCTTGAGAGCAG\nFrontiers in Network Physiology frontiersin.org04\nconditions (standard 12:12 light: dark cycle), as well as those exposed to complete darkness for 6 days and then re-exposed to light for 24 h (light re-exposure) (Figure 2B).\nWe confirmed that the expression of known immediate-early genes is reduced in animals kept in darkness for 7 days and elevated in animals kept in darkness and then re-exposed to light for 24 h (Figure 2C, qtPCR validation of selected IEGs in Supplementary Figure S11). Using RNAseq followed by differential gene expressionanalysis, we identified visual cortex genes up and downregulated by normal light v darkness (Figure 2D; Supplementary Data S2-2). Light re-exposure following darkness significantly altered a smaller number of genes as compared to mice always kept in normal light conditions (Figure 2E; Supplementary Data S2-3). However, there\nwas a strong correlation in the directionality and magnitude of change between those genes significantly changed in the context of normal light-conditions v darkness with those changed by light reexposure (Figure 2F).\n3. Anesthesia suppresses visual stimulation-mediated gene expression.\nGiven that anesthesia is proposed to act as an inhibitor of neuronal firing, we next determined the extent to which genes altered by visual sensory experience were also regulated by anesthesia. We found, as predicted, that anesthesia overall significantly suppressed genes upregulated by visual sensory\nFIGURE 1 Consequences of anesthesia on cortical transcription.

This was observed both in conditions of normal light v darkness and light re-exposure v darkness (Figure 3A), with lightstimulated gene-sets being significantly enriched for genes found to be suppressed by anesthesia (Figure 3B). However, those genes suppressed by light-stimulation were not overall upregulated by anesthesia as predicted (Supplementary Figure S3).\nFIGURE 2 Visual sensory deprivation and light-re-exposure determines activity-mediated CNS gene expression.

Total neuronal activity blockade in vitro reveals an extended set of activity-regulated genes altered by anesthesia beyond those demonstrated by visual-sensory deprivation.\nWe next set out to better understand the identified discordance between how anesthesia altered those genes enhanced or suppressed by visual sensory stimulation. One possible reason was that the level of activity suppression achievable in the visual cortex by darkness was limited. Indeed, the mouse visual cortex receives innervation from other cortical areas, and therefore even in darkness there exists an element of background neuronal firing (Keller et al., 2012).\nTherefore, we asked to what extent anesthesia altered CNS geneexpression by suppressing neuronal activity to a level beyond that possible by visual sensory deprivation alone. To determine genes altered by complete neuronal blockade, we used an in vitro primary mouse cortical neuronal culture system as previously described (Baxter et al., 2021). Primary mouse cortical neurons were cultured until day in vitro (DIV) 10 (by which time they have developed mature synapses with robust synaptic activity (Hasel et al., 2017)), and then placed into fresh medium containing 100 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX)\u2014a voltage-gated sodium channel\nblocker that completely stops neuronal firing. Following neuronal activity blockade for 24 h, cells were lysed and RNA extracted for gene expression analysis via RNAseq, and compared to control neurons kept in TTX free medium.\nUsing differential gene expression, we identified genes altered by complete neuronal activity blockade (Supplementary Data S2-4) and determined that overall anesthesia strongly upregulated genes enhanced by complete neuronal activity blockade (Figure 4A), and strongly downregulated genes suppressed by neuronal activity blockade (Figure 4B), finding that genes increased or decreased in vitro by neuronal activity blockade were significantly enriched for genes upregulated or downregulated respectively by anesthesia (Figure 4C). Genes upregulated by TTX blockade included previously identified activity-suppressed pro-death genes (L\u00e9veill\u00e9 et al., 2010). These genes were also significantly upregulated by anesthesia (Figure 4D), but not in the context of visual sensory deprivation (data not shown).\nOverall, these data suggest that anesthesia drives suppression of neuronal firing beyond that achieved by visual sensory deprivation, leading to upregulation of detrimental genes normally suppressed by neuronal activity.\nFIGURE 3 Consequences of anesthesia on genes regulated by visual sensory stimulation. (A) Anesthesia overall suppresses genes enhanced in normal light conditions v darkness (expression cut-off > 1 FPKM, p_adj < 0.05, FC > 2), or enhanced by light-re-exposure v darkness (expression cut-off > 1 FPKM, p_ adj < 0.05, FC > 1.5).

Anesthesia alters the expression of genes not regulated by neuronal activity.\nWe next set out to identify genes altered by anesthesia that are not regulated by neuronal firing. We created a combined list of genes altered by visual sensory experience (changed normal light v dark, or light re-exposure v dark) or changed in vitro by blockade of neuronal activity using TTX (expression cut-off > 1 FPKM, unadjusted p-value < 0.1). By using a higher unadjusted p-value, we ensured a higher threshold to capture all genes that were possibly activitydependent in any of the stimulation paradigms. We determined genes regulated up or down by anesthesia that were not within this possible activity-dependent set (Figure 5A; Supplementary Data S25) and confirmed that anesthesia-regulated activity-independent genes were not altered by light-stimulus or TTX blockade (Figure 5B). Ontological analyses of activity-independent genes upregulated by anesthesia found enrichment for inflammationassociated pathways including chemokine production (Il4ra, Oas1c, Ticam1, Havcr2, Tlr7, Alox8, Trpv4), arachidonic acid synthesis (Aloxe3, Cyp1b1, Alox8, Cyp2s1, Dagla) and apotosis/ necroptosis pathways (Pmaip1, Plaur, Fas, Bmf, Itpk1, Birc3, Fas, Pygl) (Figure 5C).\nFIGURE 4 Consequences of anesthesia on genes altered by neuronal-activity blockade in vitro.

TRAPseq allows identification of astrocyte-specific geneexpression changes\nNeuronal activity, besides influencing transcription in neurons, also alters transcription in nearby non-neuronal cells (Saab et al., 2016; Hasel et al., 2017; Ioannou et al., 2019). In our previous work, we described how neuronal activity alters transcription in astrocytes to regulate genes involved in astrocyte glycolysis and the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (Hasel et al., 2017), a pathway important for CNS energy\nprovision (B\u00e9langer et al., 2011). We therefore wanted to understand the extent to which anesthesia influenced activityregulated transcriptional pathways in astrocytes. Given that anesthesia has also been found to influence astrocyte signalling and functions, including altering calcium activity and lactate production, we hypothesised that anesthesia would have both activity-dependent and activity-independent effects.\nWe separated astrocyte-specific gene expression changes from those in other CNS cell-types using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) (Heiman et al., 2014). This uses the transgenic\nFIGURE 5 Anesthesia alters genes not regulated by neuronal activity.

Astrocyte-specific expression of eGFP was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using cell typespecific markers for astrocytes, neurons and microglia (Figure 6A). Tagged ribosomes, along with attached astrocyte-specific translating mRNA, were immunoprecipitated (Figure 6B). Sequencing of postTRAP mRNA (TRAPseq) confirmed enrichment for astrocyte cell type-specific genes and depletion for markers for other cell types (Figure 6C; Supplementary Figure S11), and hence allowed us to determine astrocyte-specific gene expression changes in our experimental models.\n7. Anesthesia alters astrocyte gene expression and upregulates reactivity-associated signatures.\nTo identify how anesthesia altered astrocyte genes, we exposed Aldh1l1-EGFP-rpl13a transgenic mice to 6 h isoflurane and used TRAPseq to isolate astrocyte-specific mRNA. We found that anesthesia altered a wide-programme\nof gene expression in astrocytes (Figure 7A; Supplementary Data S2-6). Gene ontology analysis of astrocyte genes altered by anesthesia reveals upregulation of genes in stress-response and pro-apoptotic pathways, and downregulation of genes in pathways related to vasoconstriction and cholesterol efflux (Apln, Dusp5, Cx3cl1, Arhgap42, Nr1h3, Sirt1, Ptch1, Cav1, Pltp) (Figure 7B).\nAstrocytes are known to alter their transcriptional profiles in response to both acute and chronic disease, a term called reactive astrogliosis. Whilst reactive astrogliosis can be defined in several different ways (Escartin et al., 2021), recent work has determined that the transcriptional response of reactive astrocytes can differ depending on the nature and timing of the insult or disease. We wanted to understand to what extent anesthesia altered transcriptional programs in astrocytes which overlap with deleterious astrocyte changes observed during acute and chronic neurodegenerative disease.\nFirst, we compared how anesthesia altered astrocyte genes associated with acute CNS insults. We used published data to identify astrocyte genes upregulated commonly by two different\nFIGURE 6 TRAPseq allows determination of astrocyte-specific gene expression.

Next, we examined how anesthesia alters genes changed during chronic neurodegenerative disease. We identified genes upregulated by two different proteinopathies associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (amyloidopathy and tauopathy, as published in Jiwaji et al.

Visual sensory-deprivation and light stimulus alter astrocyte gene expression.\nBy combining the visual sensory deprivation paradigm (described above) with TRAPseq, we identified astrocyte-specific visual cortex gene expression changes to darkness and light re-exposure. We found that visual stimulation altered the expression of hundreds of astrocyte genes (Figure 8A; Supplementary Data S2-7, 2-8), including upregulating astrocyte genes previously described to be altered by increased neuronal activity in vitro (Hasel et al., 2017); (Figure 8B). Comparing with other published datasets, we found enrichment of astrocyte genes upregulated by visual sensory experience within gene-sets identified by single-cell sequencing analysis of visual cortex genes to 4 h light exposure (Hrvatin et al., 2018), as well as astrocyte genes upregulated in mice experiencing sleep deprivation (Bellesi et al., 2015) and in mice following seizures induced by PTZ (Sapkota et al., 2022) (Figure 8C, left). This was suggestive of a common set of activity-regulated astrocyte genes altered consistently by different stimulus and experimental paradigms.

Anesthesia alters the expression of astrocyte genes regulated by neuronal activity.\nWe next investigated how anesthesia altered astrocyte genes identified to be regulated by visual sensory deprivation and stimulation. We found that anesthesia overall significantly downregulates astrocyte genes enhanced by light stimulation, and upregulates astrocyte genes suppressed by light stimulation (Figure 9A).\nA key function of astrocytes is to uptake glucose and convert this into lactate via glycolysis. According to the astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis this acts as a fuel source for nearby\nneurons. In prior work, we determined that neuronal activity upregulated the expression of astrocyte glycolysis pathway genes, increasing the ability of astrocytes to uptake glucose and produce lactate. We examined the consequences of anesthesia on astrocyte glycolytic gene expression and found that anesthesia overall suppressed astrocyte glycolytic gene expression down-regulating key glycolytic genes including those for glucose uptake (Slc2a1), rate-limiting genes for glycolysis (Pfkp, Pfkl, Pfkm), and genes regulating lactate production (Ldha, Ldhb) (Figure 9B). However, activity-suppression through dark-exposure did not have a significant consequence on astrocyte glycolytic gene expression.\n10. Anesthesia alters non-activity dependent astrocyte genes, upregulating astrocyte pathways associated with inflammation and oxidative stress.\nFinally, we determined to what extent anesthesia altered astrocyte gene expression independent of activity-mediated effects. Using an\nFIGURE 9 Consequences of anesthesia on astrocyte genes and pathways altered by neuronal activity (A) Anesthesia overall downregulates (left) astrocyte genes enhanced by light re-exposure v darkness (expression cut-off > 1 FPKM, FC > 1.5, p_adj < 0.05) and (right) upregulates astrocyte genes suppressed by light reexposure.

(2017)], using a higher unadjusted p-value to capture any genes that were at all likely to be activity-dependent in all paradigms (Figure 10A; Supplementary Data S2-9). We confirmed that activity-independent astrocyte genes altered by anesthesia did not change both in response to visual sensory-deprivation or following in vitro alteration of neuronal activity (Figure 10B). Ontology analysis of activity-independent astrocyte genes altered by anesthesia (Figure 10C) revealed predominantly an upregulation of inflammation-associated pathways, including those regulating cytokine production (Lefty1, Ccl17, Ccl3, Wnt10a, Ccl12, Wnt4), and upregulation of pathways for phagosome-lysosome fusion and immune responses."

In clinical studies, anesthesia has been linked to post-operative delirium and long-lasting cognitive impairment (Bratzke et al., 2018).\nIn this study, we used RNA-sequencing approaches to map the consequences of prolonged volatile anesthesia on cortical transcription. The sensitivity of our methods revealed hundreds of cortical genes that are altered during anesthesia, significantly expanding on the number of genes previously identified with less sensitive methods such as microarray analysis. Genes upregulated by anesthesia are enriched for ontology terms related to inflammation and apoptosis, supporting a detrimental role for prolonged anesthesia on cortical function.\nAnesthesia alters astrocyte transcription\nThe primary target of anesthetic agents has been presumed to be neurons, where they are widely considered to inhibit synaptic firing through GABA receptor activation or NMDA receptor inhibition. However, in our study, we determined that anesthesia has consequences beyond only neurons. We identified transcriptional consequences on total cortical gene expression, as well as focusing on gene expression changes occurring specifically in astrocytes. Astrocytes, the most common non-neuronal cell type in the CNS, are important for several neurosupportive roles including maintaining neurotransmitter, ionic, metabolic and antioxidant homeostasis. Anesthesia has previously been described to act on astrocytes via astrocyte GABA receptors (Chung et al., 2021), and altering astrocyte calcium signalling (Thrane et al., 2012) and gap junction properties (Liu et al., 2016). However, the transcriptional consequences of these effects on astrocyte pathways important for brain function were unknown. In this study, using TRAP-sequencing to isolate astrocytespecific gene expression changes from those in other CNS cell types, we present a detailed description of how anesthesia alters astrocyte transcription, further expanding our understanding of the molecular consequences of anesthesia on non-neuronal CNS cell types.\nWe found that the transcriptional changes induced by anesthesia in astrocytes overlap with reactive changes seen in response to both acute insults (LPS administration and acute ischaemia through MCA occlusion) and chronic insults (neurodegenerative amyloid and tau pathology). Indeed, the fact that 6 h anesthesia induced reactive changes in astrocytes previously identified in response to chronic dementia-associated pathology highlights the potential deleterious consequences of anesthesia, especially in those with pre-existing neurodegenerative disease."

            "text": "identified by visual sensory deprivation and light stimulation\nIt is widely believed that the primary mechanism of anesthesia function is through global suppression of neuronal activity through GABA activation or NMDA-receptor inhibition. Altered neuronal activity has been described by ourselves and others to alter transcriptional networks in both neurons and astrocytes to modulate pathways important for neuronal and brain homeostasis and health.\nTherefore, the consequence of general anesthesia on these activitydependent transcriptional pathways was of particular interest to us.\nIn this study, using visual sensory deprivation and light stimulation paradigms, we have revealed how altered neuronal activity regulates CNS transcription in non-anesthetized animals. We have identified hundreds of genes (across all cell-types and specifically in astrocytes) that are regulated by visual sensory stimulation. The sensitivity and added transcriptional depth possible through the TRAP-seq approaches used adds to the smaller number of astrocyte and neuronal genes previously identified to be altered by light stimulation using single-cell approaches (Hrvatin et al., 2018). Furthermore, we found that visually responsive astrocyte genes overlap with astrocyte genes altered in other studies that involved dysregulated neuronal activity such as seizures (Sapkota et al., 2022) and sleep-deprivation (Bellesi et al., 2017), consistent with a common set of activity-responsive astrocyte genes. We also found that astrocyte genes upregulated by activity are enriched in sets of astrocyte genes found to be reduced by ageing (Boisvert et al., 2018) and neurodegeneration (Jiwaji et al., 2022). As activity-dependent astrocyte pathways are essential for metabolic homeostasis, it would be interesting to understand the extent to which reductions in these pathways contribute towards brain metabolic dysfunction observed in both ageing and degenerating brains.\nAnesthesia dysregulates activity-dependent genes, suppressing activity-regulated homeostatic pathways and enhancing activity-suppressed pro-death pathways\nIn keeping with the proposed mechanism of action as an activator of GABA and inhibitor of NMDA receptors, we determined that anesthesia is a strong suppressor of activity-regulated CNS and astrocyte genes. This includes suppression of activity-regulated neuroprotective and pro-synaptogenesis genes (Bdnf, Arc, Npas4, Homer1). Indeed, the negative consequences of anesthesia on suppressing activity-dependent genes extends beyond the level of activity-suppression possible by visual-sensory deprivation and is only revealed by examining genes found to be regulated in conditions of total neuronal activity blockade using TTX in vitro. Comparing genes that are changed by total activity blockade revealed that anesthesia upregulates activity-suppressed pro-death genes and suppresses activity-enhanced genes in astrocytes responsible for CNS metabolic homeostasis. The fact that these detrimental effects are not seen in visual-sensory deprivation is of course not unsurprising, given that eye-closure or sleeping is not associated with the harmful effects attributed to anesthesia.\nOverall, these findings reveal how anesthesia suppresses activitydependent pathways in the cortex, leading to reduced expression of genes associated with brain homeostasis and boosting genes associated with cell-death. These changes may contribute to observed deleterious consequences of anesthesia, especially as dysregulation of brain metabolism has been demonstrated to occur in patients with delirium using nuclear imaging (Haggstrom et al., 2017). Our follow-on work now seeks to understand the consequences of targeting restoration of activitydependent pathways during anesthesia to reduce deleterious transcriptional changes for therapeutic benefit.\nFrontiers in Network Physiology frontiersin.org15\nActivity-independent consequences of anesthesia drive deleterious and inflammation-associated responses\nBeyond consequences on activity-dependent gene expression, we also identified that anesthesia altered expression of hundreds of CNS and astrocyte genes that were not modulated by neuronal firing as identified by visual sensory deprivation or in vitro blockade of neuronal activity. These findings are consistent with anesthesia having wider consequences on CNS beyond simply one of acting as a pharmacological inhibitor of neuronal activity.\nWe identified activity-independent consequences of anesthesia on pathways related to apoptosis and inflammation responses, including upregulating pathways related to mitochondrialassociated apoptosis pathways and lipoxygenase production. In astrocytes, we found that anesthesia alters the expression of nonactivity regulated genes related to inflammation including those regulating phagosome-lysosome function, chemokine signalling and cytokine production. These findings are consistent with anesthesia driving further deleterious and inflammationassociated responses in neuronal and non-neuronal cells beyond those detrimental effects seen by neuronal activity suppression alone.\nThe extent of inflammation-associated changes driven by anesthesia that are independent of activity-regulated effects points towards a broader pro-inflammatory role of anesthesia on CNS cells. Indeed, anesthesia has been postulated to have immune modulating effects, and the mechanisms that drive these deleterious pro-inflammatory effects (including upstream transcription factors and regulators) now requires to be studied. Furthermore, microglia-astrocyte interactions have been shown to be important in regulating astrocyte responses to inflammation (Liddelow et al., 2017). Therefore, it is likely that non-activity mediated changes of anesthesia on astrocytes may be downstream of uncharacterised microglia responses. A fuller understanding of the interactions between astrocytes and microglia (as well between astrocytes and other non-cellular elements within the brain milieu) during anesthesia may reveal important pathways that could be targeted to reduce the potentially deleterious inflammatory consequences of anesthesia identified in this work."

            "text": "An important limitation is that the data presented in this work represents changes at the level of gene expression, which may not translate to protein-level or functional consequences. The use of the translating ribosome affinity purification methodology mitigates this somewhat, as this will only sequence mRNA molecules that are being actively translated. Hence, these are more likely to represent gene expression changes reflecting changes to protein synthesis. Furthermore, we have previously determined that alterations in activity-controlled apoptosis genes by suppression of neuronal activity did lead to changes in protein concentrations (L\u00e9veill\u00e9 et al., 2010). However, our work will not identify changes to cellular functions by anesthesia through controls downstream of\nprotein synthesis (for example, changes in protein degradation pathways). Our work has investigated the consequences of a single anesthesia agent (isoflurane) on CNS and astrocyte pathways. The extent to which consequences of using other anesthesia agents overlap with our findings remains to be determined. Finally, our work does not address the long-term consequences of anesthesia on brain and astrocyte geneexpression. Ongoing work now aims to investigate how geneexpression perturbations persist following recovery from anesthesia, and the extent to which these may drive long-lasting impairments in cognition."
