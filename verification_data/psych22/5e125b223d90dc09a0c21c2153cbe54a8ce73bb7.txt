"A significant association linking support service use with task difficulty was also observed [OR=1.82; 95% CI (1.06 - 3.13)], which warrants additional research." 

"Future research should also examine the burden related to filling prescriptions in low-access communities for caregivers."

"Assistance with other medication management tasks warrants more future research."

"Future research could also explore how difficulty varies across different types of medications."

"Future research should examine how pharmacists in outpatient practice settings could use pharmacy encounters as opportunities to help caregivers with medication management."

"A similar approach could be used in future research to explore the relative difficulty in each medication management tasks."

"Finally, the cross-sectional data in this study cannot determine causality; thus, longitudinal studies are warranted."
