    "abstractText": "In this study, the physicochemical, rheological, in vitro starch digestibility, and emulsifying properties of starch extracted from pineapple stem agricultural waste were investigated in comparison with commercial cassava, corn, and rice starches. Pineapple stem starch had the highest amylose content (30.82%), which contributed to the highest pasting temperature (90.22 \u25e6C) and the lowest paste viscosity. It had the highest gelatinization temperatures, gelatinization enthalpy, and retrogradation. Pineapple stem starch gel had the lowest freeze\u2013thaw stability, as evidenced by the highest syneresis value of 53.39% after five freeze\u2013thaw cycles. Steady flow tests showed that pineapple stem starch gel (6%, w/w) exhibited the lowest consistency coefficient (K) and the highest flow behavior index (n), while dynamic viscoelastic measurements gave the gel strength in the following order: rice > corn > pineapple stem > cassava starch gel. Interestingly, pineapple stem starch provided the highest slowly digestible starch (SDS) (48.84%) and resistant starch (RS) (15.77%) contents compared to other starches. The oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion stabilized with gelatinized pineapple stem starch exhibited higher emulsion stability than that stabilized with gelatinized cassava starch. Pineapple stem starch could therefore be used as a promising source of nutritional SDS and RS, and as an emulsion stabilizer for food applications.",

            "text": "Nowadays, there is a growing global interest in exploring new starch resources and developing bio-based or environmentally friendly chemical products. Consequently, a green alternative material such as starch derived from agricultural waste would be valuable for both food and non-food products due to its low cost and availability from renewable resources [1\u20133]. Starch is the most important carbohydrate source for human nutrition and a versatile natural biopolymer found in cereals and tubers. Starch also plays an important role in controlling the structure, texture, and stability of foods [4]. There are two main categories of starch polymers: amylose and amylopectin, which are homopolymers of D-glucose chain units [5]. Based on the rate and extent of starch digestion, starch is classified as\nFoods 2023, 12, 2028. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12102028 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 2028 2 of 15\nrapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS), and resistant starch (RS) [6]. For health benefits, SDS and RS are recommended as healthy dietary carbohydrates to regulate blood glucose homeostasis and reduce glycemic response [5], which could prevent many chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. However, starches from different parts of plants such as leaves, stems, roots, and fruits differ significantly in terms of their morphological and physicochemical properties as well as their digestibility. Pineapple is one of Thailand\u2019s most commercially important fruit crops, producing more than 1.67 million tons annually [7]. Accordingly, increasing pineapple production results in a predictable amount of waste being produced each year. After pineapple harvest, the stems and leaves are considered agricultural waste. Most of this waste has no clear end-use and can be disposed of improperly, which can lead to serious environmental problems [1]. Therefore, it is crucial to utilize pineapple stem agricultural waste to improve the sustainability and economics of the process and potentially support value addition in medical and industrial food products. According to previous studies, the pineapple stem was used as agricultural waste to obtain the enzyme bromelain, which can be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries [8,9]. Recently, pineapple stem has been used as an alternative starch source for food and non-food applications [1,2,10\u201312]. In our previous studies, the fundamental characteristics of starch extracted from pineapple stems were determined, such as extraction yield, amylose content, particle size distribution, granule morphology, X-ray diffraction, swelling power, solubility, pasting properties, and gelatinization properties compared to commercially available rice, corn, and cassava starches [1]. The extraction yield of pineapple stem starch was 30% in dry weight [1]. Pineapple stem starch granules with a median particle size of 9.69 \u00b5m had a semi-angular shape with partially round segments that had two or more flat surfaces [1]. Pineapple stem starch exhibited an A- type crystalline structure with 25.12% relative crystallinity [1,2]. However, the in vitro digestibility of pineapple stem starch has not yet been studied. Moreover, the rheological and emulsifying properties of pineapple stem starch are poorly known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the extracted pineapple stem starch and investigate its rheological properties, in vitro starch digestibility, and ability to stabilize oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions in comparison to commercially available cassava, corn, and rice starches to provide valuable information for future applications."

Amylose Content\nThe amylose content of pineapple stem starch and commercial starches (cassava, corn, and rice starches) was analyzed using an amylose/amylopectin test kit (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd., Wicklow, Ireland). Starch samples were defatted by heating them in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Lipids were removed by precipitating the dispersed starch in 95% (v/v) ethanol. The precipitated starch was dissolved in an acetate/salt solution and subsequently used for amylose determination.

Visual Ob ervation of St rch Pastes\nThe pineapple stem and commercial starch pastes obtained from the RVA measurement were placed on a glass plate and cooled to 25 \u25e6C. All starch pastes were photographed with a digital camera (Kodak EasyShare M340, 10.2 megapixels, Rochester, NY, USA) against a black background to qualitatively evaluate their appearance and clarity.\n2.3.4. Microscopic Observation of Starch Pastes\nPrior to microscopic observation, the starch pastes from the RVA were stained with 0.1% iodine solution, transferred to a slide, and covered with a coverslip. The morphology\nFoods 2023, 12, 2028 4 of 15\nof the pastes was observed with a normal light microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 40\u00d7magnification.\n2.3.5. Determination of Freeze\u2014Thaw Stability\nFive grams of starch paste from the RVA were placed in a 15-mL centrifuge tube, frozen at \u221218 \u25e6C for 21 h, and then thawed in a water bath at 30 \u25e6C for 3 h, which was repeated for five cycles. Percent syneresis was determined for each freeze\u2013thaw cycle by dividing the weight of water separated after centrifugation of the sample tube at 2200\u00d7 g for 10 min by the initial gel weight and multiplying it by 100.\n2.3.6. Determination of Thermal Properties\nThe starch samples were analyzed for their thermal properties using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (DSC-1 STARe System, Mettler-Toledo AG, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) as described by Wongsagonsup et al. [14]. An aluminum pan containing a mixture of 3 mg (dry weight) starch sample and 9 mg distilled water was hermetically sealed and equilibrated at room temperature for 1 h before being placed in the DSC instrument. The sample pan was heated from 25 to 100 \u25e6C at a heating rate of 10 \u25e6C/min. For retrogradation analysis, the gelatinized starch from DSC measurement was stored at 4 \u25e6C for 7 days and then analyzed by DSC under the same conditions as for starch gelatinization. The percentage of retrogradation was calculated as follows:\nRetrogradation (%) = (\u2206Hret/\u2206Hgel) \u00d7 100\nwhere \u2206Hret is the retrogradation enthalpy and \u2206Hgel is the gelatinization enthalpy."

The amylose contents of pineapple stem, cassava, corn, and rice starches are presented in Table 1. Pineapple stem starch had the highest amylose content, which is similar to the value of 34.37% reported by Nakthong et al. [1], but higher than the value reported by Rinju and Harikumaran-Thampi [2] (23.86%). Consequently, the variation of amylose content with respect to the same starch type depends mainly on the environment, genotype, and botanical sources. The amylose contents of cassava, corn and rice starches agreed with the data reported by Srichuwong and Jane [17]. Normally, root and tuber starches have lower amylose content than normal cereal starches. Starches with high amylose content help to delay starch digestion and lower blood glucose levels [16,18], which is useful for the production of low glycemic index foods.\n* Not detected.

In accordance with the results, pineapple stem starch exhibited the lowest peak viscosity, lowest trough, lowest final viscosity, and lowest setback, but the highest pasting temperature. The breakdown of pineapple stem starch was higher than that of rice starch but lower than that of cassava starch. The higher amylose content of starch correlated with lower peak and breakdown viscosities and higher pasting temperatures [17]. However, the lipids present in rice starch can form a helical complex with the amylose, which enhances the interactions of the starch molecules, resulting in the lowest breakdown value of rice starch. A similar trend was observed by Nakthong et al. [1], who studied the pasting behavior of pineapple stem starch. The pineapple stem starch exhibited very low paste viscosity, indicating that the starch granules were very strong and their swelling was very limited. The lower peak, trough, and final viscosities of the starch could be due to more restricted starch granules [19]. Limited swelling of pineapple stem starch granules limited leaching of amylose molecules from the granules, resulting in less amylose aggregation during cooling and consequently lower setback viscosity. The limited swelling of the granules and viscosity can be attributed to the highest amylose content of the pineapple stem starch (Table 1). Amylose enhances the interaction between starch molecules, which maintains the integrity of starch granules and increases their stability [20,21]. Consequently, higher amylose content could suppress the swelling ability of the granules and reduce the pasting behavior of starch. Conversely, cassava starch exhibited the highest peak viscosity and breakdown but the lowest pasting temperature (Table 2), corresponding to the lowest amylose content (Table 1). The low amylose content may contribute to the high viscosities and low pasting temperature of the starch pastes [22,23]. Foods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 16\nTable 2.

The flow curves of freshly prepared starch gels can be fitted using the Herschel\u2013 Bulkley model. Table 4 provides a summary of the hysteresis loop area, the yield stress (\u03c30), the consistency coefficient (K), the flow behavior index (n), and the coefficient of determination (R2) of the upward flow curves. All starch gels exhibited a clockwise hysteresis loop area, indicating structural breakup caused by the shear field and a change in an existing structure, which then continues to exhibit a shear thinning characteristic during subsequent shear sweeps [32]. The larger area of the hysteresis loop, i.e., the higher thixotropy, is attributed to the greater structural breakdown of the starch gel during shearing [33]. All starch gels had n values of less than 1, indicating their pseudoplastic shear thinning behavior.

            "text": "The RDS, SDS, and RS contents of the cooked starch samples are shown in Table 5. With the exception of pineapple stem starch, all cooked starch samples had the significantly highest percentage of RDS content, especially cassava starch (79.34%), which could be explained by the complete disruption of the granule structure during cooking, facilitating susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis [15]. Previous studies have shown that the RDS fraction is the major component in cooked native starch [15,35,36]. Interestingly, the pineapple stem starch had the highest proportion of the SDS fraction. The restricted swollen granules of pineapple starch may not be easily digested by amylolytic enzymes and may consequently delay the digestibility of starch. Compared to cassava, corn, and rice starches, pineapple stem starch had the highest SDS and RS content but the lowest RDS content, which was found for the first time in this study. This is probably related to the high amylose content of pineapple stem starch, which has the ability to inhibit starch hydrolysis by limiting starch swelling. A starch with high amylose content is more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis by enhancing the starch\u2019s ability to resist enzymatic digestion [37]. Apparent amylose content is negatively correlated with RDS but positively correlated with SDS and RS [20]. In addition, the fine structure of amylopectin affects the digestibility of starch. The RS content correlates positively with the average amylopectin branch chain length and the proportion of long branch chains, but negatively with the proportion of shorter branch chains [20,38]. By lowering blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels and reducing fat accumulation, RS is crucial for maintaining good health. However, higher levels of SDS may also be beneficial for human health. SDS is usually considered the most preferred dietary starch because it is completely but slowly digested in the small intestine [39]. In addition, SDS is likely associated with beneficial health effects such as improved satiety and mental performance, blood sugar control, and diabetes management [5,39,40].\nFoods 2023, 12, 2028 12 of 15\nValues in the same column with different superscripts are statistically different (p \u2264 0.05).

            "text": "Figure 6 shows the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions stabilized by gelatinized starch samples. The creaming stability of emulsions is evaluated by means of the creaming index (CI). As shown in Figure 6A, the emulsions stabilized with corn and rice starches aged for 15 days exhibited a homogeneous appearance with no creaming (CI = 0) (Figure 6B), indicating high emulsion stability. A lower CI is related to greater emulsion stability. A more solid-like behavior of corn and rice starch gels (Figure 5B,C) could thicken the continuous aqueous phase and stabilize the O/W emulsions. The emulsions stabilized with gelatinized corn and rice starches exhibited a viscoelastic solid or gel-like texture from the third day of storage. Some gelatinized native starches such as non-waxy rice starch, waxy rice starch, and waxy corn starch showed O/W emulsifying ability by interfacial absorption [41]. However, the emulsifying ability was not clearly related to the amylose content, the crystalline pattern, and the thermal properties of the starch [41]. On the other hand, emulsions stabilized with cassava and pineapple stem starches showed high CI values (58.91% and 55.81%, respectively) from the first day of storage to 15 days of storage. A similar result for emulsions stabilized with gelatinized native cassava starch was observed in the study of Sriprablom et al. [15]. This is probably due to the fact that a large number of hydrophilic -OH groups of completely gelatinized cassava starch could limit the emulsifying properties. In the case of the emulsion stabilized with pineapple stem starch, the CI was also high, but the lower serum layer was slightly cloudier than that of the emulsion stabilized with cassava starch (Figure 6A), indicating the presence of a small amount of suspended individual oil droplets and/or swollen starch granules. The limited swollen pineapple stem starch granules can slightly stabilize the emulsion as a particle stabilizer but are not strong enough to prevent creaming, which may be due to the hydrophilic moieties and low viscosity of the continuous aqueous phase containing swollen pineapple stem starch granules, which is similar to the result reported by Kasprzak et al. [41] for high amylose corn starch. To prevent creaming, an emulsifier must be added to the continuous aqueous phase or the native starch must be modified to increase its amphiphilic properties and produce a stable emulsion [15,41,42]. For example, starch chemically modified with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) has been used as an emulsifier to stabilize conventional O/W emulsions. It has been reported that OSA-modified pineapple starch has better emulsifying properties than native starch and can be used as an emulsion stabilizer in food and pharmaceutical applications [43].\nFoods 2023, 12, 2028 13 of 15\nFoods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 16 aqueous phase and stabilize the O/W emulsions.

When starch extracted from pineap le stem was compared with commercially available cassava, corn, and rice starches, pineapple stem starch exhibited special characteristics in that it had the highest amylose c ntent, pasting, and gelatiniz tion temperatur s, gelatinization enthalpy, retrogradati n and sy eresis rat s, and th lowest paste vi cosity, indicating high granule stability. Due to its limited swelling ability, the pineapple stem starch gel had the lowest consistency coefficient and hysteresis loop area and had more liquid-like behavior than corn and rice starches. Compared with commercial starches, it had the highest contents of slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS). The emulsifying property of pineapple stem starch was better than that of cassava starch. Because of these properties, pineapple stem starch could be used as a good source of nutritional SDS and RS for food applications. Pineapple stem starch with a high content of SDS and RS can be used in the formulation of a wide range of low-moisture foods such as pasta, bread, cookies, cakes, and breakfast cereals to enhance health benefits.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.W.; methodology, J.S.; validation, J.S.; formal analysis, J.S.; investigation, J.S.; data curation, J.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.S., S.M.S., T.A., J.P. and R.W.; supervision, R.W.; project administration, R.W.; funding acquisition, T.A.
