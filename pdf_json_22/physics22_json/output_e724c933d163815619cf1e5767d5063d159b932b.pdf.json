    "abstractText": "Based on the reflection-asymmetric Nilsson potential, the parity-doublet rotational bands in oddA isotones U and Pu have been investigated by using the particle-number-conserving (PNC) method in the framework of the cranked shell model (CSM). The experimental kinematic moments of inertia (MOIs) and angular momentum alignments are reproduced very well by the PNC-CSM calculations. The significant differences of rotational properties between U and Pu are explained with the contribution of nucleons occupying proton octupole-correlation pairs of \u03c0i13/2f7/2. The upbendings of moments of inertia of the parity-doublet bands in U are due to the interference terms of alignments of protons occupying \u03c0f7/2 (1/2) and the high-j intruder \u03c0i13/2 (1/2, 3/2) orbitals. The splittings between the simplex partner bands of the parity-doublet bands in both U and Pu result from the contribution of alignment of neutron occupying the \u03bdd5/2 (1/2) orbital.",

The experimental kinematic moments of inertia (MOIs) and angular momentum alignments are reproduced very well by the PNC-CSM calculations. The significant differences of rotational properties between 237U and 239Pu are explained with the contribution of nucleons occupying proton octupole-correlation pairs of \u03c02i13/2f7/2. The upbendings of moments of inertia of the parity-doublet bands in 237U are due to the interference terms of alignments of protons occupying \u03c0f7/2 (1/2) and the high-j intruder \u03c0i13/2 (1/2, 3/2) orbitals. The splittings between the simplex partner bands of the parity-doublet bands in both 237U and 239Pu result from the contribution of alignment of neutron occupying the \u03bdd5/2 (1/2) orbital.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe typical feature for octupole correlations in oddmass nuclei is the appearance of parity-doublet rotational bands, which are pairs of almost degenerate states in excitation energy with the same spin but opposite parities [1\u20134]. The octupole correlations in nuclei are associated with the single-particle states with orbital and total angular momentum differing by 3, i.e., \u2206l = \u2206j = 3 [5, 6]. The nuclei with Z \u2248 88 and N \u2248 134 in the actinide region are expected to possess the maximum octupole correlations since their Fermi surface lies between the proton \u03c02f7/2i13/2 and neutron \u03bd\n2g9/2j15/2 octupole correlation pairs [7]. Experimentally, since the first observation of parity-doublet rotational bands in odd-mass 229Pa and 227Ac [8, 9], similar bands have been observed in many odd-mass actinide nuclei, like 219,223,225Ac, 219,221,223Fr, 221,223Th, and so on [10\u201317].\nThe parity-doublet bands are observed experimentally in 237U and 239Pu, in which some interesting properties are reported [18, 19]. In Ref. [18], the angular momentum alignments were compared for the bands in the Pu isotopes with 238 6 A 6 244, where the sharp backbending observed in the heavier isotopes is not present within the same frequency range in 239Pu. The suddenly gained alignments in the heavier isotopes are due to the contribution from a pair of i13/2 protons. There is at present no satisfactory explanation for the absence of backbending phenomenon in 239Pu. As the N = 145 isotones closest to the 239Pu, the behavior of the alignments with rotational frequency for 237U is very different. In Ref. [19], a strong backbending in alignment occurs at ~\u03c9 \u2248 0.25 MeV in 237U. In both work, the experimental observations support the presence of the large octupole correlations in the ground states and in the low-lying excited states of odd-A 237U and 239Pu nuclei. The spin\n\u2217 hext@nuaa.edu.cn\nand parity are assigned as K\u03c0 = 1/2+ for the groundstate bands in both nuclei. The experimental data shows that there exist significant simplex splittings at low rotational frequency region in the parity-doublet bands in both nuclei. These issues need further investigations.\nMany theoretical approaches were developed to investigate the octupole correlations in nuclei. These include the reflection-asymmetric mean-field approach [20\u2013 22], algebraic models [23, 24], cluster models [25\u201327], vibrational approaches [28\u201330], reflection asymmetric shell model [31\u201333] and cranked shell model [34\u201338]. The particle-number-conserving method in the framework of cranked shell model (PNC-CSM) is one of the most useful models to describe the rotational bands [39\u201341]. In the PNC-CSM calculations, the cranked shell model Hamiltonian is diagonalized directly in a truncated Fock space. The particle number is conserved exactly and the Pauli blocking effects are taken into account spontaneously. The previous PNC-CSM method has been developed to deal with reflection-asymmetric nuclei, and successfully applied to describe the alternating-parity rotational bands in the even-even nuclei [38].\nIn this work, the PNC-CSM method is further applied to describe the ground-state parity-doublet rotational bands in odd-A nuclei 237U and 239Pu. The groundstate spin assignments are identified for both nuclei. By considering the octupole correlations, Pauli blocking effects and Coriolis interaction, the striking differeces of rotational properties between 237U and 239Pu and the simplex splittings of the parity-doublet bands in both nuclei are investigated in detail.\nA brief introduction of the PNC-CSM method dealing with the reflection-asymmetric nuclei are presented in Sec. II. The detailed PNC-CSM analyses for the parity-doublet rotational bands in 237U and 239Pu are presented in Sec. III. A summary is given in Sec. IV.\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n02 02\n2v 1\n[ nu\ncl -t\nh] 5\nO ct\n2 02\n2\n2"

            "text": "The detailed understanding of PNC-CSM method dealing with the reflection-asymmetric nucleus can be found in Ref. [38]. Here we give a brief description of the related formalism. The cranked shell model Hamiltonian of an axially symmetric nucleus in the rotating frame [42\u201344] is\nHCSM = H0 +HP = HNil \u2212 \u03c9Jx +HP. (1) HNil = \u2211 hNil(\u03b52, \u03b53, \u03b54) is the Nilsson Hamiltonian, where quadrupole (\u03b52), octupole (\u03b53), and hexadecapole (\u03b54) deformation parameters are included. \u2212\u03c9Jx = \u2212\u03c9 \u2211 jx repesents the Coriolis interaction with the rotational frequency \u03c9 about the x axis (perpendicular to the nucleus symmetry z axis).\nWhen ~\u03c9 = 0, for an axially symmetric and reflectionasymmetric system, the single-particle Hamiltonian has nonzero octupole matrix elements between different shell N . Since parity p = (\u22121)N , the parity is no longer a good quantum number, but the single-particle angular momentum projection on the symmetry axis \u2126 is still a good quantum number. The single-particle orbitals can be labelled with the quantum numbers \u2126 (lj), where lj are the corresponding spherical quantum numbers.\nHowever, when ~\u03c9 6= 0, due to the Coriolis interaction \u2212\u03c9jx, the \u2126 is no longer a good quantum. Since the reflection through plane yoz, Sx invariant holds [45]. The single-particle orbitals can be labelled with the simplex quantum numbers s (s = \u00b1i), which are the eigenvalues of Sx operator.\nThe pairing HP includes the monopole and quadrupole pairing correlations HP(0) and HP(2),\nHP(0) = \u2212G0 \u2211 \u03be\u03b7 a\u2020\u03bea \u2020 \u03be a\u03b7a\u03b7, (2)\nHP(2) = \u2212G2 \u2211 \u03be\u03b7 q2(\u03be)q2(\u03b7)a \u2020 \u03bea \u2020 \u03be a\u03b7a\u03b7, (3)\nwhere \u03be(\u03b7) labels the time-reversed state of a Nilsson state \u03be(\u03b7), q2(\u03be) = \u221a\n16\u03c0/5\u3008\u03be|r2Y20|\u03be\u3009 is the diagonal element of the stretched quadrupole operator, and G0 and G2 are the effective strengths of monopole and quadrupole pairing interactions, respectively.\nBy diagonalizing HCSM in a sufficiently large cranked many-particle configuration (CMPC) space, a sufficiently accurate low-lying excited eigenstate is obtained as\n|\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211 i Ci|i\u3009, (4)\nwhere Ci is real and |i\u3009 = |\u00b51\u00b52 . . . \u00b5n\u3009 is a cranked many-particle configuration for an n-particle system, and \u00b51\u00b52 . . . \u00b5n are the occupied cranked Nilsson orbitals.

            "text": "Figure 1 and 2 show the cranked Nilsson levels near the Fermi surface of 237U and 239Pu, respectively. Due to the octupole correlations, the single-particle orbitals are parity-mixed, the only conserved quantum number are \u2126, which represent the projection of the single-particle total angular momentum j on the symmetry axis. So the parity-mixed proton and neutron orbitals are labeled by quantum number \u2126 at the bandhead (\u03c9 = 0), and the simplex s = +i (s = \u2212i) levels are denoted by solid (dotted) lines. For both protons and neutrons, such a sequence of single-particle levels are found to be reasonable in agreement with experimental data taken from Refs. [48, 49]. The Z = 92, 96 gaps for protons and N = 150, 152 gaps for neutrons are presented in nearly all odd-mass actinides, remarkably similar to the results predicted by the Woods-Saxon potential.\nComparing the proton single-particle levels for 237U and 239Pu, the proton \u03c01/2 level from \u03c0f7/2 orbital just locates at the Fermi surface for 237U, while it is far below the Fermi surface for 239Pu. As we known, \u03c0f7/2 and \u03c0i13/2 proton orbitals form the basis for the existence of strong octupole correlations in the actinide region. The neutron \u03bd1/2 (d5/2) orbital locates just at the Fermi surface for both 237U and 239Pu nuclei, which are consistent with the experimental ground state configuration with K = 1/2.\nC. Parity-doublet bands in 237U and 239Pu\nFigure 3 shows the experimental and calculated MOIs and alignments of the parity-doublet rotational bands in 237U and 239Pu. The experimental data are taken from Refs. [48, 49], which are reproduced very well by the PNC-CSM calculations. One can see that the rotational behaviors of the parity-doublet bands in 237U and 239Pu\n4\nare very different. From Figs. 3(e) and 3(f), there are sharp upbendings at ~\u03c9 \u2248 0.25 MeV for both the s = +i and s = \u2212i alternating-parity bands in 237U. In contrast, as shown in Figs. 3(g) and 3(h), the rotational behaviors are much plainer for bands in 239Pu. It is well known that the backbending is caused by the crossing of the ground-state band with a pair-broken band based on high-j intruder orbitals. In this mass region, the highj intruder orbitals involved in the Fermi surface are the \u03c0i13/2 and \u03bdj15/2 orbitals.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the occupation probability n\u00b5 of each orbital \u00b5 (including both s = \u00b1i) near the Fermi surface for the parity-doublet bands in 237U and 239Pu for protons and neutrons, respectively. The Nilsson levels far above (n\u00b5\u2248 0) and far below (n\u00b5\u2248 2) the Fermi surface are not shown. In Fig. 5, the occupation probabilities of neutron orbitals in both s = +i and s = \u2212i bands are almost constant with rotational frequency ~\u03c9 increasing, which contributes little to the \u03c9 variation of J (1). The different behavior of the rotational bands in 237U and 239Pu would be the result of the contribution from protons.\nFrom Fig. 4(a), it can be seen that the occupation probabilities of proton orbitals \u03c01/2 (f7/2), \u03c03/2 (i13/2) are almost constant (n\u00b5\u2248 1.5) at ~\u03c9 < 0.25 MeV and increase slowly at ~\u03c9 > 0.25 MeV. The occupation probability of orbital \u03c05/2 (i13/2) drops down gradually from one to nearly zero from about 0.25 MeV to 0.30 MeV. The occupation of proton orbitals \u03c01/2 (f7/2), \u03c03/2 (i13/2) and \u03c05/2 (i13/2) leads to the upbending of proton alignment at ~\u03c9 \u2248 0.25 MeV for the parity-doublet bands in\n237U [see Fig. 6(c)].\nFor 239Pu, the proton occupation probability of highj intruder orbital \u03c05/2 (i13/2) increases slightly at ~\u03c9 < 0.20 MeV and decreases slightly at ~\u03c9 > 0.20 MeV. The occupation probability of orbital \u03c05/2 (f7/2) decreases slowly at ~\u03c9 < 0.20 MeV and slow increase at ~\u03c9 > 0.20 MeV. These lead to the angular momentum alignments\n5\nkeep nearly constant at ~\u03c9 < 0.20 MeV and slowly decrease at ~\u03c9 > 0.20 MeV in the parity-doublet bands in 239Pu [see Figs. 3(g) and 3(h)].\nIn order to clearly understand the upbending mechanism, the contributions of protons to the angular mo-\nmentum alignments \u3008Jx\u3009 in the parity-doublet bands in 237U and 239Pu are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) shows that the sharp increase for the parity-doublet bands in 237U mainly comes from the off-diagonal part of proton alignments. However, as shown in Fig. 6(b) that both the diagonal and off-diagonal parts vary smoothly for the rotational bands in 239Pu.\nThe contribution of interference terms jx(\u00b5\u03bd) between the proton orbitals \u00b5 and \u03bd to the off-diagonal angular momentum alignments in the parity-doublet bands in 237U and 239Pu are shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d). The interference terms jx(\u00b5\u03bd) between orbitals of proton \u03c02i13/2f7/2 pairs are denoted by black solid lines, other interference terms are denoted by black dotted lines. The total interference term from all the proton \u03c02i13/2f7/2 pairs are denoted by olive dashed lines.\nIt can be seen clearly that the upbending at ~\u03c9 \u2248 0.25 MeV in the parity-doublet bands in 237U are mainly due to the suddenly gained alignment of protons occupying orbital \u03c01/2 (f7/2) and high-j intruder orbitals \u03c03/2 (i13/2) and \u03c05/2 (i13/2). As shown in Fig. 6(c), the interference terms between \u03c02i13/2f7/2 pairs play a very important role in the sharp increased alignment. For 239Pu, there is little contribution from the interference terms jx(\u00b5\u03bd) from \u03c0\n2i13/2f7/2 pairs at ~\u03c9 < 0.20MeV, which decreases slightly at ~\u03c9 > 0.20MeV. Therefore, the angular momentum alignments of the parity-doublet rotational bands in 239Pu are quite plain. According to the discussion above, the interference terms of proton octupole correlation pairs of \u03c02i13/2f7/2 play a key role in the rotational properties in the rotational bands between 237U and 239Pu.\nD. Simplex splittings in parity-doublet bands of 237U and 239Pu\nFrom Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), one can see that the kinematic moments of inertia and their variations with rotational frequency are very different between s = +i and s = \u2212i bands for 237U. There is a simplex splitting occurred at low rotational frequency (~\u03c9 < 0.10 MeV) region. The similar phenomenon is occurred in the paritydoublet rotational bands in 239Pu in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). These simplex splittings in the parity-doublet rotational bands of 237U and 239Pu can be understood from the behavior of the unpaired neutron \u03bd1/2 (d5/2) orbital.\nAs it shows in Figs. 5(a)-(d) that the neutron occupation probability in simplex s = +i and s = \u2212i bands for both 237U and 239Pu are very similar. The neutron \u03bd1/2 orbital is half occupied (n\u00b5 \u2248 1), and other neutron orbitals are nearly full occupied (n\u00b5 \u2248 2) or empty (n\u00b5 \u2248 0). The contributions of neutrons to the moments of inertia J (1) in the parity-doublet bands in 237U and 239Pu are shown in Fig. 7, in which the contributions from the diagonal and off-diagonal parts in the s = +i and s = \u2212i bands are presented in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), respectively. It can be seen clearly that the simplex splittings in the\n6 moments of inertia mainly come from the contributions of the diagonal part.\n\u00b5 jx(\u00b5) and off-diagonal parts\u2211\n\u00b5<\u03bd jx(\u00b5\u03bd) are denoted by red and blue lines, respectively (top row). The contribution of nucleon occupying each neutron orbitals are presented in bottom row.\nThe diagonal parts J (1) of contribution from each neutron orbitals near the Fermi surface for the parity-doublet rotational bands in 237U and 239Pu are presented in Figs. 7(c) and 7(d). It can be seen that the contribution of each simplex doublet is almost same to each other except for the \u03bd1/2 (d5/2) orbitals, which shows significant splittings at ~\u03c9 < 0.10 MeV. It is clearly shows that the simplex splittings of J (1) at ~\u03c9 < 0.10 MeV for the parity-doublet bands in 237U and 239Pu come from the splitting of the contribution of \u03bd1/2 (d5/2) orbitals."

            "heading": "IV. SUMMARY",
            "text": "The parity-doublet rotational bands in odd-A isotones 237U and 239Pu are investigated by using the cranked shell model with the pairing correlation treated by a particle-number-conserving method, in which octupole deformation are taken into account in reflectionasymmetric nuclear system. The experimental moments of inertia and alignments versus the rotational frequency ~\u03c9 are reproduced very well by the PNC-CSM calculations. The microscopic mechanism of the distinct difference of rotational behaviors between the bands in 237U and 239Pu, and simplex splittings in the parity-doublet bands for both of 237U and 239Pu are explained.\nSharp upbendings of the moments of inertia J (1) occur at ~\u03c9 \u2248 0.25 MeV in the parity-doublet bands in 237U whereas J (1) is quite plain during the whole observed frequency for 239Pu. This is due to the contribution of the alignments from nucleon occupying the octupolecorrelation pairs of \u03c02i13/2f7/2. The upbendings of the parity-doublet bands in 237U are due to the alignments of the interference terms of protons occupying the \u03c0f7/2 (1/2) and the high-j intruder \u03c0i13/2 (1/2, 3/2) orbitals while it contributes a little to the parity-doublet bands in 239Pu.\nThere are splittings of the simplex partner bands at ~\u03c9 < 0.10 MeV of the parity-doublet bands in both 237U and 239Pu. It is found that the simplex splittings between the s = +i and s = \u2212i rotational bands result from the contributions of alignment of neutron occupying the \u03bd1/2 (d5/2) orbital."
