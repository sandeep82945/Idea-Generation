    "abstractText": "1 Background Human behavior often involves the use of an object held by or attached to the body, 2 which modifies the individual's action capabilities. Moreover, most everyday behaviors consist of 3 sets of behaviors that are nested over multiple spatial and temporal scales, which require 4 perceiving and acting on nested affordances for the person-plus-object system. This systematic 5 review investigates how individuals attune to information about affordances involving the person6 plus-object system and how they (re)calibrate their actions to relevant information. 7 Methods We analyzed 71 articles\u201434 on attunement and 37 on (re)calibration with healthy 8 participants\u2014that experimentally investigated the processes involved in the perception of 9 affordances for the person-plus-object system (including attunement, calibration, and recalibration). 10 Results With respect to attunement, objects attached to the body create a multiplicity of 11 affordances for the person-plus-object system, and individuals learned (1) to detect information 12 about affordances of (and for) the person-plus-object system in a task and (2) to choose whether, 13 when, and how to exploit those affordances to perform that task. Concerning (re)calibration, 14 individuals were able (1) to quickly scale their actions in relation to the (changed) action 15 capabilities of the person-plus-object system and (2) to perceive multiple functionally equivalent 16 ways to exploit the affordances of that system, and these abilities improved with practice. 17 Conclusions Perceiving affordances for the person-plus-object system involves learning to detect 18 the information about such affordances (attunement) and the scaling of behaviors to such 19 information (calibration). These processes imply a general ability to incorporate an object attached 20 to the body into an integrated person-plus-object system. 21 22",

Moreover, most everyday behaviors consist of 3 sets of behaviors that are nested over multiple spatial and temporal scales, which require 4 perceiving and acting on nested affordances for the person-plus-object system. This systematic 5 review investigates how individuals attune to information about affordances involving the person-6 plus-object system and how they (re)calibrate their actions to relevant information. 7 Methods We analyzed 71 articles\u201434 on attunement and 37 on (re)calibration with healthy 8 participants\u2014that experimentally investigated the processes involved in the perception of 9\naffordances for the person-plus-object system (including attunement, calibration, and recalibration). 10 Results With respect to attunement, objects attached to the body create a multiplicity of 11 affordances for the person-plus-object system, and individuals learned (1) to detect information 12 about affordances of (and for) the person-plus-object system in a task and (2) to choose whether, 13 when, and how to exploit those affordances to perform that task. Concerning (re)calibration, 14 individuals were able (1) to quickly scale their actions in relation to the (changed) action 15 capabilities of the person-plus-object system and (2) to perceive multiple functionally equivalent 16 ways to exploit the affordances of that system, and these abilities improved with practice. 17 Conclusions Perceiving affordances for the person-plus-object system involves learning to detect 18 the information about such affordances (attunement) and the scaling of behaviors to such 19 information (calibration). These processes imply a general ability to incorporate an object attached 20 to the body into an integrated person-plus-object system. 21 22 Keywords: ecological psychology, perception-action, attunement, calibration 23 24\nA fundamental concept of Gibson\u2019s ecological approach to perception-action is that of 2 affordance (J. J. Gibson, 1979). Affordances are opportunities for action as higher order, emergent 3 relations in the animal-environment system (Stoffregen, 2003a). That is, affordances emerge from 4 the multifaceted relationship or fit between animal and environment. In any given situation, there 5 are a multitude of affordances (i.e., a field of affordances; see Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). Which 6 of the multitude of affordances are perceived as well as whether, when, and how any of these 7 affordances are actualized depend on the intentions of the animal (Shaw & Kinsella-Shaw, 1988)\u20148 specifically the overarching goal(s) to be achieved and the behavior(s) required to do so. 9\nHowever, behaviors are not performed in isolation. Achieving a given overarching goal 10 typically requires that a particular set of behaviors be performed in a particular way given a 11 particular set of circumstances. That is, behaviors are both nested within other behaviors (over 12 multiple spatial and temporal scales) and within the goals for which and circumstances under 13 which those behaviors occur. Consequently, affordances for a given behavior are nested within 14 other affordances (over multiple spatial and temporal scales, Stoffregen, 2003b) and within the 15 goals for which and the context within in which those affordances are perceived (Bingham & 16 Muchisky, 1995). 17 Depending on the overarching goal to be achieved, the set of behaviors required to achieve 18 that outcome can be performed sequentially, simultaneously or in parallel (i.e., simultaneously but 19 independently of one another). Consequently, depending on the particular goal-directed behavior 20 to be performed, the set of affordances for behaviors that yield the intended outcome can likewise 21 be perceived sequentially, simultaneously or in parallel (Mark et al., 2015). Moreover, perceiving, 22 or actualizing a given affordance can influence what affordances are subsequently perceived or 23 actualized (Ye et al., 2009). This implies that a given affordance can be superordinate to (of higher-24 order than) or subordinate to (of lower-order than) another (Wagman et al., 2016a). That is, higher-25 order affordances may emerge from the relationship between lower-order affordances (Peker, 26 B\u00f6ge, Bailey, Wagman & Stoffregen, in press). 27\nas a means-ends hierarchy (Vicente & Rasmussen, 1990; Wagman et al., 2016a, but see 2 discussion of a possible alternative heterarchical organization in the Discussion section). According 3 to Vicente & Rasmussen (1990), each level of the hierarchy includes a set of affordances that 4 relate to the why, what and how of performing a behavior. At any level of the hierarchy, 5 affordances are simultaneously and mutually constrained by the other levels, rather than in a strict 6 top-down fashion. In this conceptualization, the behavior itself (e.g., using a ladder) is performed at 7 the (intermediate) \u2018what\u2019 level. This level represents the specific behaviors to be performed but 8 does not represent either the goals for which they are being performed or the means by which they 9\ncould be performed. The superordinate (why) level relates to the goals of the behavior\u2014 why one 10 engages in this behavior (e.g., retrieving an object)\u2014but does not prescribe the specific behaviors 11 necessary to achieve that goal. The subordinate (how) level, on the other hand, relates to means 12 by which the behavior can be carried out (e.g., stepping). In addition, in this conceptualization, 13 perceiving affordances for a given behavior does not correspond to perceiving affordances for a 14 specific sequence of behaviors but rather to a field of possibilities that generalizes beyond any 15 particular sequence (Wagman et al., 2019). That is, perceiving affordances for a given behavior 16 simultaneously reflects affordances nested at both lower and higher levels of the hierarchy. 17 In many (if not all) cases, affordances emerge from a multifaceted fit between the animal\u2019s 18 action capabilities and the substances, surfaces, places, objects, and events that comprise the 19 animal\u2019s niche (see Richardson et al., 2008). Consequently, the same substances, surfaces, 20 places, objects, and events may or may not afford the same behavior for two different animals 21 (even of the same species) depending on the specific action capabilities of each animal (Fajen, 22 2008). 23 Action capabilities (and hence, perception of affordances) are determined, in part, by an 24 animal\u2019s anthropometric properties. For example, Warren (1984), found that (perception of) the 25 boundary between stairs that afford climbing and those that do not could be expressed as a body-26 scaled ratio of 0.88 between leg length and step height. However, action capabilities are also 27 determined by more dynamic properties such as strength, coordination, and balance. Accordingly, 28\naffordances for stair climbing (Konczak et al., 1992). Consequently, perception of affordances is 2 likely best captured through action-scaled (rather than body-scaled) metrics because (maximum) 3 action capabilities and skills influence not only the ability to perform a given goal-directed behavior 4 but also both attunement (i.e., pick-up of information) and calibration (i.e., scaling of action) of 5 perception of affordances for that behavior (Fajen, 2005). In other words, body-scaled affordances 6 are a special case of action-scaled affordances (Comalli et al., 2013; Day et al., 2015; Franchak & 7 Adolph, 2014). 8 Attunement, or the education of attention (E. J. Gibson, 1969; J. J. Gibson, 1966), has been 9\ndefined as the process of progressively detecting patterns in lawfully structured energy arrays that 10 provide increasingly useful information about a given affordance. In other words, performing a 11 given behavior for a given overarching goal under a particular set of circumstances requires that an 12 animal detect information about a very particular multifaceted fit between animal and environment 13 (Jacobs & Michaels, 2007). The more complex the goals for which a given behavior is being 14 performed and the more complex the circumstances under which that behavior is being performed, 15 the more specific the information about that fit becomes. Additionally, given that any given goal can 16 be achieved by a variety of different behaviors, and any given behavior can be performed in a 17 variety of different ways, a given goal-directed behavior can be performed in multiple ways and by 18 multiple means. This means that performing a goal-directed behavior requires flexibly and 19 temporarily recruiting potentially independent anatomical components into a smart\u2014task-specific\u201420 device capable of achieving the goal-directed goal (Bingham, 1988; Runeson, 1977). 21 Consequently, successfully performing a given goal directed behavior requires that animals 22 precisely scale choices about whether, when, and how to perform a given behavior to their action 23 capabilities (Fajen, 2007). The process that establishes and maintains the scaling between action 24 (and perception) and information about a given affordance to make such choices is known as 25 calibration (Withagen & Michaels, 2005). Of course, perceiving and acting capabilities change over 26 both the short term and long term. In many cases, such changes require recalibration\u2014learning a 27 new scaling relationship between information about affordances for a given behavior and whether, 28\nFranchak, 2017). 2 In general, studies indicate that perception of affordances for a given behavior increasingly 3 reflect an animal\u2019s action capabilities as they become attuned to (as they learn to detect) the 4 information about a given affordance (Fajen & Devaney, 2006). Moreover, as animals learn to 5 detect more useful information about a given affordance, they can learn (become calibrated to) 6 how to use that information to more precisely scale choices about whether, when, and how to 7 perform that behavior and they can relearn (recalibrate) how to do so when circumstances change 8 (Fajen, 2005). For instance, experience in a given perception-action task typically leads a 9\nperceiver toward detecting and exploiting increasingly useful informational variables that enable 10 increasingly fine-tuned perceiving and behaving (Jacobs et al., 2000, 2001; Jacobs & Michaels, 11 2002, 2007). 12 In this respect, it could be argued that over the course of long-term practice, experts in a 13 given perception-action task (1) have learned to detect more useful information about task-specific 14 affordances than novices (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2005), (2) have become more precisely calibrated to how 15 use such information to perform such tasks. It could also be argued that given more finely 16 developed abilities to detect information about task-specific affordances coupled with more finely 17 developed abilities to exploit such information about task-specific affordances, experts in a given 18 perception-action task also have (3) more finely developed abilities to perceive task-specific action 19 boundaries than do novices. 20 Given that experts have highly developed abilities to detect and exploit information about 21 task-specific affordances, they are better able to use (1) many different coordination patterns to 22 perform a given task-specific behavior over the short term and (2) many different behavioral 23 patterns (i.e., many different nestings of coordination patterns) to achieve a given task-specific 24 overarching goal over the long term. In other words, experts can re-organize multiple degrees of 25 freedoms at multiple levels and over multiple time scales to achieve consistent performance 26 outcomes (Seifert et al., 2016). In the biological systems literature, the ability of structurally 27 different elements to yield same outcome is known as degeneracy (Edelman & Gally, 2001). 28\norganization and scale (Mason, 2015). 2 Recently, researchers have used the concept of degeneracy to better understand the stable 3 yet flexible performance of skilled athletes. As an example, Seifert et al. (2021) found that expert 4 climbers exhibited variable behavioral patterns both within and between bouts of climbing. In a 5 climbing task involving nested affordances, participants were asked to touch or grasp a rock-6 climbing hold in a number of different ways: (1) by either moving their hand or the foot first; (2) by 7 using either a face-on or side-on body position to the wall; and (3) by using multiple the support 8 points. The results showed that the complexity of the nesting of affordances modified both the 9\nnumber of degrees of freedom available to the climber (i.e., number of joints or limbs involved in 10 the coordination) and the likelihood of combining actions in a temporal sequence. These findings 11 suggest that the nesting of affordances allows climbers to exploit degeneracy and open up new 12 possibilities for climbing. One way to investigate the nesting of affordances is through the person-13 plus-object-system. 14 Tool-use 15 In everyday life, the objects used in the course of performing many goal-directed activities 16 change the action capabilities of the animal and thereby alter the fit between animal and 17 environment. An object attached to or held by an animal creates an integrated person-plus-object 18 system with a unique sets of action capabilities and control dynamics. Such objects simultaneously 19 increase action capabilities for some tasks (e.g., the ability to reach distant objects) and decrease 20 them for other tasks (e.g., the ability to fit through narrow spaces). Therefore, animals must be able 21 to perceive how an attached or held object changes the task-specific affordances for performing a 22 given goal-directed behavior over the short term and for achieving multiple overarching goals over 23 the long term. That is, perceiving affordances of and for the person-plus-object system should 24 require the same processes of attunement, calibration and recalibration as are required for 25 perceiving affordances for the person without such an object. To this end, it is important to 26 consider person-plus-object system as a spontaneously assembled smart instrument (see Carello, 27 Fitzpatrick, Domaniewicz, et al., 1992; Runeson, 1977). Doing so means that (1) a given person-28\nobject system can be assembled over many different anatomical structures, and (3) many different 2 person-plus-object systems can be assembled over the same anatomical structures. 3 A large body of research has explored the presumption that the information that supports 4 perceptual capabilities with respect to the person-plus-object system is defined over the invariant 5 patterns of deformation of the body\u2019s muscular and connective tissues that occur when 6 manipulating the attached or held object. Therefore, perceiving affordances of and for the person-7 plus-object system should require the same processes of attunement and calibration to information 8 in making choices about whether, when, and how to perform a given behavior with or with respect 9\nto the person-plus-object system. 10"

            "text": "Despite sustained interest in the topic of affordances and the ubiquity with which objects 12 are held by or attached to an animal in the course of performing everyday behavior, an 13 understanding of perception of affordances of and for the person-plus object system is still 14 emerging (see Mangalam et al., 2022). Moreover, no systematic review of this topic was available 15 at the time of our search. Based on this body of literature, this systematic review aims to establish 16 the state of science regarding the perception of affordances of and for the person-plus-object 17 system. The central research questions in this systematic review are related to how humans 18 become attuned to the information about affordances of and for the person-plus-object system and 19 calibrate their actions to such information. To answer this question, we discuss the scientific 20 literature in two main categories. The first set of studies that we reviewed were those examining 21 attunement: these studies investigated the detection of informational variables that support 22 perception of affordances for the person-plus-object system, in particular, how such detection 23 changes with practice. The second set of studies we reviewed were those examining calibration 24 and recalibration: these studies focus on the degree to which perceived action boundaries on a 25 given behavior reflect the actual action boundaries on that behavior, and in particular, how this 26 relation changes with practice. Then we make suggestions for future research and how those 27 processes could be understood as being organized heterarchically (as opposed to hierarchically). 28\nEligibility 2 Studies were included in the systematic review if (1) they included healthy human 3 participants; (2) they investigated perception of affordances (implicitly or explicitly) of or for the 4 person-plus-object system; (3) they used physical objects (rather than a virtual object or an image 5 of an object); (4) they were experimental studies (if there was manipulation of an independent 6 variable); (5) the study referred to attunement, calibration or recalibration; (6) were published in an 7 English-language peer-reviewed journal as an original full-length paper (i.e., not a review or 8 conference paper). 9\nSearch strategy 10 Literature search and selection were carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items 11 for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (Moher et al., 2009). The initial search was 12 conducted in November 2021, with additional searched carried out in January 2023. A three-step 13 procedure was used to identify relevant studies. First, we selected Pubmed, APA PsychArticle and 14 Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection as relevant databases to identify studies that met 15 the inclusion criteria summarized above. Each search was structured to include two sets of terms; 16 the first set relating to the person-plus-object system: object, wear, tool-use, handheld, altered 17 body, locomotion, dynamic touch; and the second set relating to ecological psychology: affordance, 18 perception-action coupling, ecological approach, ecological psychology, body-scaled, action-19 scaled, attunement, calibration, recalibration. The terms included within each of these collections 20 were separated with the operator \u2018OR\u2019, while the two collections of terms were linked with the 21 operator \u2018AND\u2019. All possible variants of words like \u2018change\u2019 and \u2018decrease\u2019 were entered in 22 databases. We included the title, abstract, keywords, and topic as search areas. To further identify 23 relevant studies, we reviewed the reference lists and citation of all studies identified in step one. 24 The titles and abstracts of all papers retrieved via the systematic search strategy were exclusively 25 screened by the first author (PV) based on the outlined inclusion criteria. Next, the remaining full-26 text studies were screened using the same inclusion criteria. 27 Quality assessment 28\n(Crowe, 2013) which was developed based on a wide number of previous critical appraisal tools, 2 general research methods theory and reporting guidelines and exhibits high construct validity 3 (Crowe et al., 2011) and reliability (Crowe et al., 2012). Quality assessment is a standard part of 4 systematic review and informs on the methodological quality of the included articles (Hohn et al., 5 2019), notably the CCAT is composed of eight categories representing the various aspects of a 6 study, including abstract, introduction, design, sampling, data collection, research ethics, results, 7 and discussion. Each category contains a number of attributes, which are marked as present, 8 absent, or not applicable and are scored on a scale from 0 to 5. The scores for the eight categories 9\nare then added together and summarized as a percentage to indicate the paper's overall 10 methodological quality. As the CCAT protocol does not provide a specific protocol for interpreting 11 the score, and as each category does not have the same weight, the range of possible scores for 12 each category was divided in terciles, with articles assessed as exhibiting either; i) low (0-1); ii) 13 moderate (2-3); or high (4-5) methodological quality; then a global score was generated as the sum 14 of all the categories and was expressed as a percentage (for another example of systematic review 15 using the CCAT, see van Andel et al., 2017). The results of the quality assessment are available 16 as Online Resource (Supplementary Materials, Table 1 and Figure 1). 17 Result 18 Study selection 19 The literature search in Pubmed, APA PsycArticles and Psychology and Behavioural 20 Sciences Collection resulted in 3171 hits (2799, 98 and 279 hits respectively). We removed 150 21 duplicates resulting in 3021 unique references. Of these 3021 references, 73 met the inclusion 22 criteria based on a reading of the titles and abstracts, and 45 of these met the criterion based on a 23 reading of the full text. An additional 26 references were included based on a review of the 24 reference lists and citations of these 45 references, yielding a total of 71 references that were 25 included in this review. The literature search and selection process are displayed in Figure 1. 26 27\nlisted in the subsection: Eligibility. 2\n3 Descriptive statistics 4 Characteristics and results of the 71 studies included in this systematic review are 5 summarized in Online Resource (Supplementary Materials, Table 2). Studies are published in 20 6 different journals; most were published in Ecological Psychology (22%), followed by Attention, 7 Perception & Psychophysics (14%) and Experimental Brain Research (11%). Thirty-three articles 8\nexperiments conducted. 2 Of all the studies, 48% (n = 34) investigated attunement. More specifically 13 investigated 3 attunement to constraints related to the task itself, 10 investigated attunement to constraints 4 related to the object itself, and 11 investigated attunement to constraints related to the individuals 5 themselves. 52% (n = 37) investigated calibration or recalibration. More specifically, 16 6 investigated calibration to constraints related to the task constraints, 14 investigated calibration to 7 constraints related to the object, and 7 investigated calibration to constraints related to the 8 individuals themselves. 9\nAttunement 10 Task 11 Perceiving affordances or other properties of the person-plus-objects system requires 12 detecting the mechanical parameters that are invariant over transformation (e.g., as the object is 13 being manipulated). This means that detecting such parameters is a process of actively 14 differentiating those mechanical parameters that vary over such transformations and those that do 15 not. This process is part of what leads to attunement to such invariant mechanical parameters with 16 practice in a given perceptual task (especially when feedback is provided). 17 Michaels et al. (2007) asked a group of participants to rate how well eight different objects 18 afforded performing twelve different tasks. They found that the patterns of ratings that emerged in 19 participants who simultaneously looked at and wielded the objects were not different from the 20 patterns that emerged when they only looked at but did not wield the objects. However, it is 21 important to consider that participants who wielded the objects did not have the opportunity to 22 explore its use, an experience that may have been sufficient to bring about a change in their 23 ratings. Studies of perceptual learning have demonstrated that participants can shift from a less 24 informative variable to a more informative variable after feedback. Wagman et al. (2001) asked 25 participants to perceive the height or width of wielded objects before and after different kinds of 26 practice. Results showed that participants became attuned to a more informative variable occurred 27 only when feedback was included as part of practice. Similarly, Withagen and Michaels (2005) 28\nfeedback about verbal feedback about whether two rods were of the same length or of different 2 lengths in their second experiment. Such feedback induced a switch from a non-specifying variable 3 in pre-test to a specifying variable in post-test for most of the participants. To further explored the 4 role of information gathered by feedback on attunement, Menger and Withagen (2009) asked 5 whether attunement can transfer between a wielding context and a holding context. Experiment 1 6 consisted of a testing phase in which participants estimated the length of a held (but not wielded) 7 rod and a feedback phase in which participants reported the length of a wielded rod and were 8 provided feedback about actual length of the rod. In Experiment 2, the mechanical contexts 9\n(holding or wielding) were reversed. Results suggest improvement in the holding context 10 transferred to the wielding context, but not vice versa. 11 De Vries et al. (2015) investigated the transfer of attunement between anatomical 12 components. Specifically, participants had to estimate the length of a rod with both hands and both 13 feet, before and after receiving feedback about judgements made with one the effectors. Training 14 the hand resulted in increased attunement for both hands but not with the feet. Conversely, training 15 one of the feet lead to smaller improvement for all the anatomical parts. The authors suggest that 16 the ability to control and explore an object with an effector could be an important factor to become 17 increasingly attuned to a specifying variable. 18 Arzamarski et al. (2010) expanded these studies on perceptual learning to investigate how 19 a change of intention might affect attunement. First, their results replicated previous studies by 20 showing that when participants perceive either the height or the width of wielded objects and 21 received feedback, they gradually shift toward detecting the specifying variable for that particular 22 property. Second, they found that when participants change intention\u2014from perceiving length to 23 perceiving width, or vice versa\u2014they show dramatic changes in which specifying variable they 24 detect. Similar results were obtained by Wagman and Carello (2001, exp. 1) and Wagman et al. 25 (2016a) showing that affordances for using an object in a hammering task and in a poking task 26 were specified by different variables. The same is true for categorizing objects as being more 27 appropriate for performing a hooking or sliding task on a target object (Wagman et al., 2016b). 28\nvariables participants detected and used in both perceiving and remembering a given property of a 2 wielded object. They asked participants to perform two tasks\u2014 (1) judge affordances for reaching 3 with a pair of wielded rods, and then \u2014after the rods were no longer present\u2014 (2) judge the 4 (remembered) heaviness of each rod. Participants judged that the two rods were differently heavy 5 only when they expected to perform both tasks (likely because they were able to attend to 6 information about both properties during the first task). Conversely, participants judged that the two 7 rods were equally heavy when they only expected to perform the first task (likely because they only 8 attended to information about affordances for reaching with the rod and not the heaviness of that 9\nrod). In addition, Ye et al. (2009) presented objects that had multiple affordances to participants. 10 Participants were asked to identify all objects that afforded a particular behavior, and then identify 11 all objects that afforded a different behavior. The authors observed that perceiving a given object to 12 afford a given behavior decreased the likelihood of perceiving the same object to afford other 13 behaviors, presumably because of what informational variables were detected initially. 14 Wagman et al. (2016a) observed that when participants assemble tools for use in different 15 tool use tasks, they create tools with larger principal moment of inertia values when those tools are 16 to be used in a striking task than when they are to be used in a poking task. These results parallel 17 Hove et al.\u2019s (2006) findings that participants rate the suitability of differently weighted hockey 18 sticks based on the behavior to be performed with that stick (generate the most force on a puck or 19 accurately maneuver a puck). Follow up experiments found that, after performing each of these 20 tasks, participants adjusted their ratings to reflect how well the objects could be used in each task. 21 Environment 22 A detached object is part of the surrounding environment and is external to the individual. 23 However, when held or attached to the body, the object is no longer merely a part of the 24 environment. It is a part of the person-plus-object system, and the individual must perceive the shift 25 in the boundary between him or her and the environment such that the object is included as a part 26 of this system (J. J. Gibson, 1979). 27\nare perceived as such and not as a combination of (properties or) affordances for the person and 2 (properties or) affordances of the object. Both Thomas & Riley (2014) and Wagman & Stoffregen 3 (2020) found that perception of affordances for reaching with a tool was not reducible to an additive 4 combination of perception of affordances for reaching (without the tool) plus perceived tool length. 5 Similarly, Thomas & Riley (2014) also found that perception of affordances for passing through an 6 aperture while holding an object was not reducible to an additive combination of perception of 7 affordances for passing through the aperture (without the object) and perceived object width. 8 Thomas et al. (2017) went further by examining the effect of practice on this perception. They 9\nfound that while perception of affordances for reaching with a tool improves over trials, perception 10 of tool length does not. Moreover, in a follow up study, they found that only perception of 11 affordances for reaching with a tool (and not perception of tool length) improved with practice and 12 such improvements did not transfer to perception of tool length. 13 Individuals have to learn what objects are manipulable and how they can be manipulated. 14 Steenbergen et al. (1997) found that young children alter their grip on different spoons so as to 15 maintain a functional relationship between the spoon and rice that was being scooped and 16 transferred to a bowl. Later research by Wagman and Carello (2003) showed that participants 17 modulate their grasp position for hammering so as to create a person-plus-object system with 18 inertial properties appropriate for the specific task. Thus, participants chose a grasp position on a 19 tool that maximized the volume of the inertial ellipsoid (V) in order to hammer with power; and that 20 preserved V and the symmetry of the inertial ellipsoid (S) while minimizing the eigenvectors (ek; 21 i.e., the symmetry axes of the hand-object system) in order to hammer with precision. In the same 22 way, participants choose a striking location on given both the grasp location on that object and the 23 specific striking task (Wagman & Taylor, 2004). Mangalam et al. (2019) showed that the discovery 24 of tooling affordances can be facilitated by emphasizing a change in inertial properties. Indeed, 25 participants made fewer configuration changes and took fewer trials to render a heavier object 26 (consisting of a blade and a shaft) a functional hoe than they did with a lighter object. 27\nsystem when performing behaviors such as passing through an aperture. Higuchi et al. (2009) 2 found that under such circumstances, the gaze patterns used to detect information about 3 affordances for crossing depended on the extent to which the object changed the behavior of the 4 participant. These results suggest that when perceiving affordances for crossing an aperture for 5 the person-plus-object system, the exploratory behaviors used to detect information differ only 6 when the object fundamentally changes the action capabilities (and subsequent behavior) of the 7 participant. Fixation patterns remained unchanged while walking, while walking while holding a 8 horizontal bar without shoulder rotation, and walking while holding a horizontal bar with shoulder 9\nrotations. However, fixation patterns moved toward door edge throughout locomotion more 10 frequently when crossing the aperture in a wheelchair. 11 By changing the location of the attachment of an object to the body, Malek & Wagman 12 (2008) and Regia-Corte & Wagman (2008) showed that perception of affordances for standing on 13 an inclined surface varied depending on whether and how a weighted backpack was worn. 14 Specifically, perception of affordances was influenced by whether the backpack was worn on the 15 front, the back, or not at all (Malek & Wagman, 2008) as well as the height at which the backpack 16 was worn on the back (Regia-Corte & Wagman, 2008). 17 Individual 18 Individual characteristics (e.g., aging, expertise, body composition) have an important role 19 in the perception of affordances in general and thus may also influence attunement in the person-20 plus-object system. The studies included in this review have investigated how attunement occurs 21 over development, but also how it differs between different members of a given population. 22 Several studies have investigated how such abilities develop by asking children to perceive 23 and use objects attached to or held by the body in various tasks. van Leeuwen et al. (1994) asked 24 children to retrieve a target object using a hooked stick that was placed in different configurations, 25 creating different spatial and temporal complexity in the behavior. The first experiment identified 26 three distinct groups of participants. The first group comprised the oldest children who showed a 27 high success rate for the three simplest configurations but a slightly lower success rate for the two 28\nunsuccessful for all configurations. A third group was composed of children of different ages whose 2 success rate decreased as task complexity increased. In the second experiment, the participants 3 performed the task in order of decreasing complexity\u2014from hardest to easiest. The results showed 4 that once a child performed the task successfully, they subsequently performed the task 5 successfully on all remaining trials. Finally, in the third experiment van Leeuwen et al (1994) 6 included the possibility of performing the task with the straight portion of the hooked stick. Two 7 groups emerged, one group that successfully used the hooked stick using both sections of the stick 8 (curved and straight sections) and another group that only used only one section of the stick (either 9\ncurved or straight sections). Interestingly, the group that could use the hook in both ways (curved 10 and straight sections) showed a higher rate of success. 11 Keen et al. (2014) also observed better coordination of the person-plus-spoon system in 12 older children (8-years-olds) compared to younger children (4-year-olds) in feeding task. The 13 researchers asked children to use a spoon to feed themselves, a puppet on their lap, or a puppet 14 facing away from them. The 4-year-olds showed high inter- and intra-individual variability in how 15 they performed this task, including using less effective grips. In comparison, the group of 8-year-16 olds mostly used more effective grips that varied according to task. Fragaszy et al. (2016) 17 investigated how 1- to 2-year-old children explored and used hammers depending on the presence 18 or absence of a handle and the hardness of the surface to be struck with the hammer. They 19 observed that children\u2019s ability to use the hammer improved from 1- to 2-year-old, both in terms of 20 precision and kinematic force employed. Fitzpatrick et al. (2012, 2018) directly compared the 21 performance of preschool aged children (3-5) years old to adults in a task that required 22 hammerings pegs into a pegboard. Both the preschool aged children and the adults were able to 23 discriminate and modulate some aspect of the hammering task in response to variation in the 24 inertial properties of the hammers. However, the performance of the preschool children was still 25 not as good as that of the adults in this respect. Specifically, children were less consistent in their 26 grasping, hammered fewer pegs and produced smaller amplitude movements than the adults. 27\nexpect that age would bring about changes in the ability to perceive affordances. Carello et al. 2 (2000) found both young (approximatively 19 years of age) and older adults (starting from 62 years 3 of age) could perceive affordances for reaching with and the location of the sweet spot of a tennis 4 racket. However, the older adults perceived the sweet spot as being closer to the hand, especially 5 for long rackets. Those results were replicated by Chang et al. (2008), who also found that 6 experience in playing a racket sport\u2014rather than age alone\u2014was a stronger factor in explaining 7 the difference observed. 8 To further examine whether attunement deteriorates with aging, Withagen and Caljouw 9\n(2011) trained young and elderly to perceive affordances for reaching with a rod (i.e., participants 10 received visual information about the length after they made the report). They found that young 11 adults successfully learned to detect a specifying variable, while the elderly continued to rely on 12 non-specifying variable. They concluded that the ability to attune to specifying variables declines 13 with aging. 14 In addition, studies have explored whether there are individual differences in perception of 15 affordances across members of a given population. Both Withagen and van Wermeskerken (2009) 16 and Rop and Withagen (2014) have found differences in the way individuals respond to feedback 17 about perception of affordances for reaching with a rod. Withagen and van Wermeskerken (2009) 18 found that individuals varied in whether, when and how they respond to feedback over the course 19 of seven test blocks and six feedback blocks. Three learning profiles stood out: (1) those who 20 detected the specifying information in at least one test phase; (2) those who relied on non-21 specifying variables during all phases and appeared not to benefit from feedback; and (3) those 22 who were affected by the feedback but still relied on non-specifying variables. Rop and Withagen 23 (2014) explored whether such individual differences are due to variability in the ability to detect 24 non-specifying variables, which may lead to continued reliance on such variables. One group 25 received feedback on perceived length for a set of rods in which there was a low correlation 26 between actual length and non-specifying variables (such as static moment); the other group 27 received feedback for a set of rods in which there was a stronger correlation between actual length 28\nmore variability when there was a stronger correlation between non-specifying variables and actual 2 length. This suggests that individuals vary in their ability to use feedback to shift from detecting 3 non-specifying to detecting specifying variables. 4 Finally, Muroi and Higuchi (2017) investigated perception of affordances for passing 5 through an aperture while holding an object horizontally under different vision conditions\u2014a static 6 vision condition in which participants viewed the aperture at the start of the trial but had to pass 7 through it with vision occluded, a full vision condition in which vision was never occluded, and two 8 dynamic vision conditions in which participants were required to stop and start again after taking 9\ntwo steps and then pass through the aperture with or without vision occluded. They found that 10 perception of affordances in this task depended on whether the task was performed continuously 11 (i.e., without stopping) and whether (and when) vision was occluded while performing the task. In 12 particular, in all conditions in which vision was occluded, participants failed to make appropriate 13 body rotations resulting in frequent collisions. 14 Calibration 15 Task 16 An object attached or held to the body changes the person\u2019s action capabilities, but these 17 changes will have different consequences depending on the particular task to be performed or the 18 constraints of that task. Studies have investigated both calibration of perception to such changes in 19 a particular task and transfer of such calibration to a different task. 20 Withagen and Michaels (2007) examined whether recalibration in dynamic touch transfers 21 between functionally equivalent tasks. In their first experiment, they examined if calibration of 22 perception of affordances for reaching (i.e., length) transferred to perception of the location of the 23 sweet-spot, and in their second experiment, they examined whether calibration transferred in the 24 other direction. They found that calibration transferred from perception of affordances for reaching 25 (i.e., length) to perception of the location of the sweet-spot, but calibration transferred in the other 26 direction only in half of the participants. Along the same lines, Wagman & Van Norman (2011) 27 showed that when (visual) feedback was provided, calibration transferred (1) between different 28\nwhole and partial length) and (3) between different grasps positions and different tasks. Similarly, 2 Franchak (2020) examined whether calibration could transfer between perception of affordances 3 for squeezing and fitting through narrow doorways while wearing a backpack. He showed that 4 perception of affordances improved only in the practiced task and that no transfer was observed 5 between squeezing and fitting, or vice versa. Petrucci et al. (2016) compared perception of 6 affordances for passing over, under, or between obstacles by firefighters wearing protective 7 equipment. The results showed both underestimation and overestimation of action boundaries both 8 of which may create important safety concerns during a rescue. It was pointed out by Petrucci and 9\ncolleagues that variability among equipment across fire departments may be a contributing factor 10 to the results. 11 Abney et al. (2014) compared different types of feedback (experimenter feedback vs. 12 changing the grasp position on the object) to investigate the improvement of perception of 13 affordances for reaching with an object. Results showed that ratio between perceived and actual 14 reachable distance improved for both type of practices, approaching 1.0. Practice have also been 15 observed to improve perception of affordances for squeezing through a narrow space by 16 participants wearing a pregnancy pack (Franchak & Adolph, 2014, exp. 3), reducing the error 17 judgment from 10.5 cm to 2.4 cm. 18 Franchak (2017) asked five groups to report their ability to fit through doorways before and 19 after different practice experiences. In each practice experience, participants had different sources 20 of information available to them \u2013 optic flow, vision of backpack, haptic feedback. In addition, some 21 practiced by performing the action of fitting through the doorway and some did not. The results 22 showed that only the groups that practiced the action or received feedback about judgement 23 accuracy showed recalibration in the posttest. Ishak et al. (2019) obtained comparable results in 24 perception of affordances for crawling under a barrier while wearing a backpack. Participants were 25 asked to choose the largest backpack (ranging from 10 \u2013 30 cm thick) that they could wear and 26 safely low crawl under a barrier. They performed the task before and after choosing the backpack 27 (Pre/Post experience), only after choosing the backpack (feedback experience) or without 28\nexhibited lower failure rates, probably because they were more conservative in choosing a 2 backpack width compared to other groups. In a related task in which participants were asked to 3 squeeze through a narrow space with a backpack, Franchak & Somoano (2018) showed that 4 recalibration occurs quickly\u2014rather than gradually\u2014after participants receive outcome feedback, 5 resulting in errors being reduced by 2-3 cm. In a second experiment, they investigated how the 6 success/failure outcome feedback (practice or verbal) sequence (failure first, success first or 7 interleaved order) affects perceptual learning. Calibration occurred when all participants received 8 both successful and failed outcome feedback, regardless of sequence order or the type of 9\nfeedback. 10 However, in some cases, limited practice is not sufficient to recalibrate perception of 11 affordances for all tasks involving the person-object system. Yasuda et al. (2014) asked three 12 practice groups (high-resolution, low-resolution and control) to report their ability to pass through 13 apertures while holding an horizontal bar (exp. 1) or while using a wheelchair (exp. 2). They found 14 that perception of this affordance was improved for both practice groups (HR and LR) while holding 15 the bar but not when using a wheelchair. Likewise, in Higuchi et al. (2004) three groups of 16 participants reported perceived affordances for passing through an aperture in a wheelchair. The 17 authors found that even 8 days of practice was insufficient to completely calibrate perception of 18 affordances for this behavior, although some improvements did occur. 19 Many of the studies included in this review investigated whether certain kinds of exploratory 20 movements are necessary or sufficient for calibration or recalibration of perception of affordances 21 for the person-plus-object system. In some of these studies, participants reported whether or not 22 they would be able to pass under a barrier while in a wheelchair (Yu et al., 2010; Yu & Stoffregen, 23 2012). Participants were less calibrated to their ability to perform this task when head and torso 24 movements were restrained prior to and during the sessions. However, Yu & Stoffregen (2012) 25 found that accuracy of judgements was unaffected when the head was restrained if the participants 26 did not have active control over their locomotion during the practice session. Likewise, Higuchi et 27 al. (2006) found that when participants passed through an aperture while holding an object or while 28\nanother study, participants were asked to report whether they could pass under a barrier while 2 using a wheelchair (Stoffregen et al., 2009). One group received 2 minutes of wheelchair 3 locomotion practice, another received 2 minutes of task practice, and the last group received no 4 practice. Perceived minimum barrier height better reflected actual minimum barrier height in the 5 practice groups; however, no group improved across trials. Participants who practiced using the 6 wheelchair\u2014 and especially those that practiced the specific task\u2014 showed lower variability in 7 head and torso velocity and path length. In two other studies, participants estimated the maximum 8 height at which they could sit when they were wearing 10 cm blocks on their feet (that increased 9\nthe maximum height of a surface on which they could sit) (Mark et al., 1990; Stoffregen et al., 10 2005). In the study by Mark et al. (1990), participants were able to recalibrate to their changed 11 sitting ability only when their exploratory body sway movements were relatively unconstrained. 12 Stoffregen et al. (2005) confirmed that changes in exploratory body sway were related to 13 calibration of perception of affordances for sitting. Specifically, participants who recalibrated 14 exhibited a decrease in the variability of head and torso movement. 15 Environment 16 As described earlier, an object attached to or held by the body changes a person\u2019s action 17 capabilities. Research has examined both the individual\u2019s ability to perceive the new maximal 18 action capabilities and their ability to act near this maximum for a given task. 19 Mark (1987) found that when participants wore 10-cm blocks on the soles of their shoes, 20 perception of maximum sitting height improved over the course of twelve trials (that did not include 21 practice sitting), approaching the same ratio of perceived-to-maximum as when no blocks were 22 attached. However, perception of block height did not improve. Similarly, Hirose & Nishio (2001) 23 found improvement in perception of affordances for sitting and stepping while wearing geta shoes 24 (but only when surface heights were presented in an ascending order), a pattern that also occurred 25 when not wearing the shoes. A number of studies extended these results to other tasks. Wagman 26 & Taylor (2005) found that participants were able to perceive affordances for carrying an object 27 through a doorway regardless of whether they were able to see the rod. Wagman & Malek (2007) 28\nthrough the aperture while carrying an object. Although this perception is not related to the 2 individual's action capabilities, they showed that the perceptual boundaries (in relation to the object 3 width) decreases when the participant anticipates running rather than walking. Ramenzoni et al. 4 (2008) showed that participants could perceive affordances for reaching-while-jumping both for 5 themselves and for another person and could perceive how such affordances changed when they 6 or the other person were wearing ankle weights. Ishak (2008, exp. 3) asked participants to reach 7 through an aperture using their dominant hand with and without a prosthesis that increased hand 8 width. They found that participants adjusted their reaching behavior based on how the prosthesis 9\nchanged their hand size. Franchak & Adolph (2014, exp. 2) compared perception of affordances 10 for squeezing though a narrow doorway with and without wearing a pregnancy pack. Although the 11 group who wore pregnancy pack were less accurate than the group who did not, they still made 12 accurate judgments in relation to the change in their body dimensions. Comalli et al. (2017) 13 investigated whether wearing ankle weights affected whether participants choose to step over or 14 duck under a horizontal barrier. Results showed that participants exhibited the same transition 15 point between these two behaviors (stepping over and ducking) when ankle weights were worn 16 and when they were not. 17 In several studies included in this review, participants reported their maximum vertical 18 reaching height when they expected to reach by various means (such as while standing on the 19 floor, while standing on a stool and, with a hand-held tool). Wagman & Morgan (2010) found that 20 participants were sensitive to how each means of reaching would increase maximum reaching 21 height and when the two means would do so equivalently. Wagman et al. (2013) found that this 22 occurred both when the two objects were visible and after they were removed from view. That is, 23 perception of maximum reaching height was scaled to reaching ability equivalently for (1) both 24 means of reaching and (2) when the tool was visible or out of view. 25 Wagman et al. (2019) found that participants are better calibrated to perception of 26 affordances for reaching with the arm than with a hand-held object. The ratio of perceived to 27 maximum action capabilities was less than 1.0 in both cases but was closer to 1.0 for touching 28\npractice, post-test design, participants were asked to report their maximum reaching height if they 2 were to reach while standing on their heels, on their toes, with or without a tool (Wagman, 2012, 3 exp. 2) or kneeling, standing and using a step (Wagman et al., 2014). One group practiced the task 4 by making the estimation and then performing the action. Another group only estimated their 5 maximum reach height, without performing the action. The results showed that perceived 6 maximum reaching height more closely reflected actual maximum reaching height for all means of 7 reaching (different positions, with and without an object) following practice but only when practice 8 included reaching attempts. 9\nWithagen and Michaels (2004) and Stephen and Hajnal (2011) investigated transfer of 10 calibration between anatomical components. Specifically, participants reported the perceived 11 length of a rod wielded with the left hand and right hand (Withagen & Michaels, 2004) or with hand 12 and with the foot (Stephen & Hajnal, 2011) before and after receiving feedback about perceptual 13 reports in one of these conditions. Ratios between perceived length and actual length showed an 14 improvement in the post-test regardless of the effectors trained so long as the participant had 15 received feedback. 16 Individual 17 Given perception of affordances scales to (differences in) action capabilities, studies have 18 investigated whether perception of affordances for the person-plus-object system similarly scales 19 to (differences in) action capabilities. 20 Pepping & Li (2000) asked women and men to report their maximal overhead reaching 21 ability with and without wearing 15-cm blocks on their feet. As expected, the perception of 22 affordance in each condition was scaled to action capabilities and was not dependent of the sex of 23 the person. Similarly, Wagman & Smith (2018) found that the maximum step-with-crutches 24 distance was scaled to the participant\u2019s leg length and reflected their actual ability to perform this 25 behavior. 26 Perception of affordances for the person-plus-object system has also been studied across 27 different age groups. Franchak (2019) compared the ability of young children, older children and 28\nwearing a backpack. He found that participants who generated feedback through (succeeding or 2 failing while) attempting the task made more accurate judgments than those who did not. Overall, 3 in this study, adults had lower absolute error than older children, who themselves had smaller 4 absolute error than young children. Finkel et al. (2019) investigated recalibration of perception of 5 affordances for reaching through an opening by both young and older adults who wore a splint on 6 their hand for 24-hours. They were tested before, immediately after, 24-hours after wearing the 7 splint and then directly after removing the splint. Young adults were able to recalibrate perception 8 of affordances, but they were more conservative when perceiving affordances for reaching with 9\nthan without the splint. Older adults exhibited a perceptual boundary at a smaller opening before 10 wearing the splint and while wearing the splint than young adults. After the 24-hours period of 11 wearing the splint, both groups tended to show recalibration of perception of affordances. 12 Another method to examine the effect of (longer-term) practice on perception of 13 affordances for the person-plus-object system is through expertise. Higuchi et al. (2011) compared 14 the ability of American football players, rugby players and control athletes to run or walk through an 15 aperture, with or without wearing shoulder pads. The main result showed that American football 16 players exhibited smaller magnitudes and later onset of shoulder rotation than rugby and control 17 athletes, but only in conditions specific to the sport (i.e., running through aperture with shoulder 18 pads). Moreover, every group tended to underestimate the absolute width of the shoulder pads. 19 Also, in Pfaff and Cinelli (2018) rugby players crossed an aperture composed of either two poles or 20 a pole and a person, while running or walking, with or without a ball. The result showed that 21 participants displayed more restricted movement paths (e.g., reduced mediolateral movement of 22 the center of mass) with the ball than without, and created more space between themselves and 23 the aperture boundary when the aperture boundary included a person. 24 Finally, as for attunement, Hackney et al. (2014) found that participants recalibrated at 25 different rates to changes in affordances for passing through an aperture while carrying a tray. 26 Some recalibrated quickly and maintained their initial critical point (i.e., the minimum aperture width 27\nand decreased the critical point. 2 Discussion 3 Main findings 4 Attunement 5 The results of this systematic review highlighted for attunement that: (1) individuals learn to 6 detect information about a particular affordance for the person-plus-object system; (2) objects that 7 are (or might be) attached to the body create a multiplicity of affordances for the person-plus-object 8 system, requiring that the person choose which affordances to exploit and how to exploit them and; 9\n(3) perception of affordances for the person-plus-object system reflects how affordances are 10 nested within the context of a particular task. 11 Information pick-up. Recent work suggests that objects attached to or held by the body 12 become experienced as part of the body; therefore, the attunement should be with respect to 13 information about affordances for the person-plus-object system. The results of our review are in 14 line with this claim: studies showed that individuals perceive nested affordances for the person-15 plus-object system by detecting, attuning to, and calibrating action to information about such 16 affordances. 17 Given that the information about a given affordance is invariant over transformation, 18 individuals are able to detect information about a given affordance in different energy arrays by 19 means of different perceptual systems. In addition, studies have shown that individuals exploit 20 information about performing task-specific behaviors. In short, the information about affordances 21 for the person-plus-object system seems to be dependent on a particular task but independent of a 22 particular energy array. 23 By definition, affordances of any kind are emergent (or higher-order) relations within the 24 animal-environment system (Stoffregen, 2003a). These higher order relations differ from the 25 animal or environment components that comprise them. The same ought to be true for affordances 26 for the person-plus-object system\u2014that is, the higher order affordances for the person-plus-object 27 system ought to differ from those for the person or of the object. In general, the results of the 28\nreview suggest that the individual does not perceive the isolated properties that make up the 2 system, such as the length of their arms or of the object itself, but rather he or she perceives the 3 affordances for the person-plus-object system as such. Along similar lines, studies have shown 4 that improvement in the perception of affordances for the person-plus-object-system is 5 independent from improvements in perception of the properties that compose it. 6 Multiplicity of affordances. Generally, many different objects can be used to achieve the 7 same goal and the same object can be used to achieve many different goals. The multiplicity of 8 affordances gives rise to the questions of both intention (because perception of opportunities for 9 action is goal-directed and involves choices) and object design (because objects will always have 10 multiple affordances even if they are designed for a specific purpose). It has been shown that 11 intention guides the detection of relevant informational variables that support perception of 12 affordances. And, of course, the affordances of manufactured objects are constrained by the 13 design of those objects. Thus, objects always afford multiple behaviors, and the individual must 14 choose from among these to achieve the intended goal. On one hand, designing objects to afford a 15 limited set of particular behaviors would facilitate the detection and exploitation of information 16 about this particular set of affordances of that object, but doing so may make more difficult to 17 detect and exploit information about other affordances. On the other hand, designing objects that 18 afford many different behaviors would allow facilitate the detection and exploitation of information 19 about many different affordances but may make it more difficult to (quickly) detect and exploit 20 information about a particular affordance. Therefore, objects with a complex design could offer 21 multiple affordances which would entail that sets of behaviors nested over spatial and temporal 22 scales are specific to the goal-directed task. Future studies should take this property into account. 23 Relation between affordances. One fruitful framework for understanding relationships 24 among affordances in performing a goal-directed task under a particular set of circumstances, is 25 that of a means-ends hierarchy (Vicente & Rasmussen, 1990; see Wagman et al., 2016a). The 26 results of the studies included in this review are consistent with sensitivity to the nesting relations 27 among affordances in such a hierarchy (but should be considered subordinate to a broader 28\nor create objects so as to perform a given behavior in the context of both the overarching goal and 2 the underlying circumstances. For example, assembling a tool for use in a given task required 3 participants to perceive affordances for the assembled tool both before and while it was being 4 assembled. That is, participants had to create higher-order affordances for the person-plus-object 5 system by exploiting lower order affordances (Wagman et al., 2016b). Consequently, performing 6 any goal-directed behavior entails perceiving (and thus detecting information about) affordances 7 for nested behaviors. However, attunement to information about a given (nested) affordance is 8 often insufficient for successful performance of a goal-directed behavior. In addition, individuals 9\nmust also calibrate their actions to that information. 10 Calibration 11 The results of this systematic review highlighted that: (1) exploration is associated with (and 12 often necessary for) improved calibration and or recalibration; (2) individuals quickly recalibrate to 13 changes brought on by an object attached to or held by the body; (3) calibration to a given 14 affordance for the person-plus-object system can bring about functionally equivalent changes in 15 perception of other affordances for the person-plus-object system. 16 Exploration for calibration. Exploration (i.e., moving so as to facilitate detection of 17 invariant patterns in ambient energy arrays) generates information about the animal-environment 18 system, including the person-plus-object system. According to the studies included in this review, 19 the degree of calibration is related to the ability of the individual to explore ambient energy arrays 20 via movements, even movements as subtle as postural sway. The more constraints on exploratory 21 movement, the less the individuals were able to calibrate to changed action capabilities. Although 22 generation and pick-up of information can occur during actions that are not explicitly exploratory 23 (see Hacques et al., 2021), exploration to achieve the goal facilitates calibration improvement 24 and/or recalibration. 25 Action boundaries. To perform a goal-directed behavior successfully and safely, 26 individuals must be sensitive to the boundaries of their action capabilities for performing that 27 behavior (Fajen, 2007). Objects attached to or held by the body modify the action capabilities and 28\nsensitive to how an object attached to the body changes their action capabilities (and thus changes 2 affordances for) a particular task. However, this may depend on the specifics of both the object and 3 of the task (Higuchi et al., 2004; Yasuda et al., 2014) and future studies should expand this area of 4 research. 5 In terms of the relation between perceived action capabilities, individuals were able to 6 maintain the same ratio (between perceived:maximum and actual:maximum) for affordances for 7 the person-plus-object system as for the person (without the object), highlighting the ability to 8 quickly recalibrate after a period of practice. Results included in this review indicated recalibration 9 to new action capabilities was facilitated with task-relevant experience and developmental changes 10 in action capabilities, especially into early adulthood. However, recalibration to changed action 11 capabilities is sometimes less well facilitated, either because of more conservative choices or 12 because of declines in action capabilities. Overall, task-specific experience and expertise seems to 13 lead to a better calibration or recalibration, but it remains unclear whether this is due to a decrease 14 in the variability of behaviors that the individuals can perform, to a better awareness of action 15 boundaries, to greater maximal action capabilities, or to some combination of these. 16 Functional equivalence. As highlighted previously, an object can be used to achieve 17 several different goals, but a given goal can also be achieved by several different means or by 18 means of using several different objects (i.e., relating to functional equivalence). Experiments have 19 shown that two different (by functionally equivalent) means of reaching can bring about functional 20 equivalent changes in perception of affordances for reaching for the person-plus-object system. In 21 addition, in some circumstances, calibration of perception of affordances for performing a given 22 behavior by one particular means transfers to perception of affordances for performing that 23 behavior by a different means. 24 However, even though two objects may be used to achieve functionally equivalent ends, 25 this does not necessarily mean that using those objects requires equivalent degrees of effort or 26 ability. How individuals make decisions among those means is not well understood, particularly 27 when functional equivalence could be observed and reflect skilled behavior Thus, skilled behavior 28\nobject to perform the behavior and the ability to incorporate the object to the animal-environment 2 coupling. However, there is a lack of research investigating how skilled performers better 3 incorporate the object into a person-plus-object system than less skilled performers, and then 4 better perceive the multiply nested affordances and exhibit functional equivalence. 5"

            "text": "By reviewing the research on attunement and (re)calibration processes with respect to the 7 person-plus-object system, our findings emphasized how the perception of affordances of an 8 object attached to or held by the body facilitates the performance of functional equivalent behaviors 9\nin achieving the task goal. However, everyday behaviors are often considerably more complex (as 10 several degrees of freedom must be coordinated to act synergistically) than simple lab-based 11 activities, and it is unclear whether the results of such studies would be transferable to more 12 complex situations. Thus, there is a lack of research investigating complex richly nested behaviors, 13 particularly in relation to the unique control dynamics of the person-plus-object system and the 14 many degrees of freedom involved in performing complex tasks. 15 In addition, investigating how the particular design of an object would offer multiple (nested) 16 affordances depending on the skill of the individual would be of great interest to better design 17 objects (Pagano et al., 2021) and to develop skill acquisition programs. Obviously, the ability of an 18 individual to perform successful behaviors will vary depending on their action capabilities and how 19 the object changes these action capabilities. This is an important focus for future research, 20 especially for professions that require expertise such as athletes, firefighters, or military. It can be 21 hypothesized that as the object becomes more complex, it may offer a wider range of affordances 22 some of which may be less obvious to the individual. Furthermore, design complexity generally 23 allows functional equivalence in tool use and raises the question of the selection of relevant 24 affordance among the different possible action modes (Mangalam et al., 2019). For instance, 25 expert climbers could exhibit functional equivalence in the movement pattern used to anchor their 26 ice tool by using either swinging, kicking or hooking actions (Seifert et al., 2014). Although an 27 individual can master some of these modes of action, it is coordination of these modes in the 28\nclimbing. 2 We have considered the relationship between affordances of and for a person-plus-object 3 system. In particular, we have done so in the context of the means-ends hierarchy developed by 4 Vicente & Rasmussen (1990). However, hierarchies describe a choice that was made, not the 5 process of choosing between the coexistence of many behavioral potentials in the perception-6 action system (see Profeta et al., 2020). To account for the multifaceted fit between individual and 7 object that yields multiple affordances for the person-plus-object system, and more broadly how 8 individuals organize their behavior effectively in their environment, we introduce the concept of 9\nheterarchy, which may be more consistent with a thoroughgoing ecological approach of perceiving 10 and acting with the person-plus-object system (Shaw & Turvey, 1981). Unlike a hierarchy, a 11 heterarchy has no fixed levels of elements, no fixed roles for elements, and no fixed relationship 12 among elements. Instead, different sets of elements flexibly and dynamically emerge as particular 13 circumstances unfold. Therefore, any given element in the system can have any number of ways to 14 any number of other elements, depending on circumstance (Profeta et al., 2020). 15 In this view, intentions, affordances, and the animal-environment are components of an 16 organizational system that are unranked with respect to one another or have the potential to be 17 ranked in multiple ways with respect to one another (Figure 2). Consequently, the constraints are 18 multidirectional and distributed across the many interacting components of the organizational 19 system and subsystems. There are an unlimited number of intentions that an individual might have 20 in any given situation, but a subset of these can be acted on at any given moment. For behavior to 21 be successful, intentions must be related to the individual and the environment that surrounds him 22 or her. In the situation where the environment does not meet the intentions, it can motivate 23 exploration of the individual-environment system to achieve the intended goal (Stoffregen, 2003a). 24 Similarly, an unlimited number of affordances emerge from the relationship between the animal 25 and the environment, but only a subset of these actually stand out as relevant to the individual\u2019s 26 current goals (i.e., the field of affordances) (Wagman et al, 2016b; Wagman, et al., 2019). For 27 instance, the many affordances that comprise the heterarchy have the potential to be nested (over 28\n\u201cWhat makes an action what it is, is not the hierarchical integration of responses into some 2 movement pattern, but rather, it is the nesting of control processes that organize postures and 3 movements to serve some function\u201d. 4\nFigure 2. Goal-directed behavior heterarchy. 5\n6 Inevitably, hierarchies emerge from heterarchies due to constraints of other systems and of 7 the subsystems (Figure 3). Therefore, existing analyses of affordance nestings within means-ends 8 hierarchies (Vicente & Rasmussen, 1990; Wagman et al., 2016) can be understood as being 9\ncompatible with but subordinate to a broader analysis in terms of heterarchies (Profeta et al., 10 2020). 11 Following this view, the components of the animal and environment system are coordinated 12 (i.e., functionally ordered in space and time)\u2014resulting in synergies\u2014to reduce the dimensionality 13 of the system (i.e., complexity). Thus, in the case of a person-plus-object system, coordination 14 patterns are assembled and disassembled by reordering the subsystems or components involved, 15 as well as by recruiting or releasing them (Kelso et al., 1993). 16 The emergent skilled behavior is not merely a matter of appropriately switching from one 17 action to another but also in appropriately coordinating the various means and various ends to 18 generate and control multiple (and multiply nested) modes of action to perform the goal-directed 19 behavior. For example, in the case of crossing an aperture while cycling, many actions are 20 possible (leaning, standing, braking, etc.) and one of the possibilities to cross an aperture in cycling 21\nand lean the bike to successfully cross the aperture. In another situation, the individual could 2 express a different mode of action such as braking from a certain distance of the obstacle to 3 reduce his/her speed so that he/she can rotate the handlebar more accurately. Thus, hierarchies 4 can emerge as situation-specific actualization of potentials due to constraints imposed upon the 5 heterarchical logic (Profeta et al., 2020). 6 7\nFigure 3. In the case of aperture crossing in bike, many affordances are available (e.g., leaning, 8 standing, turning \u2026) and the skilled behavior that will emerge is a coordination of the different 9\nelements to form a mode of action (in a means-ends hierarchy manner) in relation to the intentions 10 and the individual-environment system. 11\n12 13 This reconceptualization builds on the pioneering work by Shaw and Turvey (1981), Reed 14 (1982) and Vicente and Rasmussen (1990) highlighting the coexistence of many potentials for 15 behaving in perception-action systems, including person-plus-object system. Moreover, this 16 reconceptualization emphasizes the degeneracy property of expert perception-action system by 17 showing (1) how several means could be coordinated to achieve a given outcome, (i.e., exhibiting 18 degeneracy: MANY structures - to - ONE function relationship; Edelman & Gally, 2001), but also 19 (2) how those means and modes of action could achieve many different outcomes, i.e., exhibiting 20\nfunctions relationship). In Figure 3, degeneracy is exploited when several modes of action (i.e., 2 pedaling, braking, leaning, turning) are nested differently to achieve the same goal (i.e., crossing 3 the aperture). Likewise, pluri-potentiality is exploited when the same modes of action (i.e., 4 pedaling, leaning, turning the handlebar) are coordinated to achieve different goals (i.e., crossing 5 the aperture and \u2018dancing on the pedals\u2019 to climb a slope). 6 Conclusion 7 Overall, we conclude that individuals can perceive affordances of an object attached to or 8 held by the body through the processes of attunement and calibration, implying a general ability to 9 form a person-plus-object system. This systematic review revealed that the literature investigating 10 perceiving and acting on affordances for the person-plus-object system is currently limited to 11 nested affordances of relatively limited complexity. In particular, future research should investigate 12 the use of objects with multiple degrees of freedom (objects with multiple affordances), how 13 individuals coordinate the degrees of freedom of the object with the degrees of freedom of their 14 body to achieve the overarching goal (if, when, how, they develop a synergy), and how individuals 15 perceive different affordances of a given object in relation to achieving an overarching goal. 16 Research lines worth pursuing when studying the affordance in the person-plus-object should 17 include the study of task and object complexity and skill expertise. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27\nand, this systematic review was not preregistered. 2 References 3 Abney, D.
