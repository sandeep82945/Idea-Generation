Unawareness causes distractions and results\nin learning inefficiencies. Furthermore, without institutional support (IS)\nachieving effective learning could never be possible. Therefore, this study\ninvestigates the relationships between project-based learning (PBL) and\nmental health awareness (MHA) with effective English language teaching\namong university students in China. We also tested the moderation effect of\nIS in the relationships between PBL and MHA with effective English language\nlearning (EEL). Using the purposive sampling technique, we collected\nvalid responses from 713 students studying English as a foreign language\nin universities and colleges in Harbin, China. The findings interestingly\nsupported the direct hypotheses between PBL and EEL, as well as MHA and\nEEL. Moreover, the moderating role of IS established a significant effect\non both PBL and EEL, as well as MHA and EEL, respectively.

            "text": "English teachers have been facing severe criticism in East Asian economies, as they must transform their teaching methodologies into an inclusive pedagogy to promote students\u2019 effective learning (1, 2). Educators have been experimenting with various methods for effective English teaching in East Asian nations to guarantee that every student in their class has an equal opportunity while enjoying learning English. Academicians have developed many terms like \u201clearning for knowledge\u201d to explain the learning and its methodologies that depend on the student\u2019s understanding (1). Among these methods, few refer to minor changes in methodology, whereas most require teachers to seek, evaluate, and explore the students to develop their ideas. In such dynamic learning perceptions, awareness is of utmost importance, and eventually, it grows when students and teachers are actively involved in discussions. Previous research has highlighted that students\u2019 effective learning depends on good acoustics (2). For instance: digital literacy (3), students\u2019 competence (4), and the role of a teacher (5). In ineffective teaching methods, students face severe issues in comprehending the class content leading to underperformance (6). It creates problems in learning not only language-related four skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, but it also deteriorates other cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills to be used in the subject matter. Moreover, it establishes mental healthrelated challenges for the students (7). The present study aims to check the relationship between the students\u2019 mental health awareness (MHA) and practical learning. One significant challenge is measuring the extent of students\u2019 MHA in light of specific mental health concerns and effective learning.\nKnowing the students\u2019 best learning approaches and how they affect their learning direction makes these approaches crucial. The constructive basis for learning is influenced by how well individuals know about their mental health, as MHA activities reinforce students\u2019 perceptions of learning. For effective learning to occur, collaborative efforts from academic institutions and their personnel in providing students an environment of learning, inspiration, and equal opportunities to learn must be considered most of the time, students who are interested in learning ultimately mainly participate in classroom activities is the outcome good mental health. So, the good mental health of an individual student can turn him/her into a significant contributor to the learning environment, facilitate the effective learning process of their classmates, and be an enormous help to the campus community. However, regrettably, none of these possible advantages are always reaped.\nDue to widespread COVID-19 disease worldwide, every country has made significant decisions to ensure their public health safety (8). COVID-19 has also brought a tsunami of information, from which most are misleading rather than mischief (9). This misleading information led to disobedience at a community level, and the public did not follow the health\nsafety-related protocols set by the government. This makes it even more significant for the public to have health-related awareness (8). It is connected with mental health and needs special attention because common health-related understanding causes severe cognitive health issues (10). According to van den Broucke (11), there must be strict guidelines for sharing any news related to COVID-19 because the cycle of fake news has caused depression, anxiety, and other psychological issues (12). If the situation persists, this will significantly affect the mental health quality of the individuals (13).\nFitri (14) noted that putting much study-related burden on the students upsets their mental health, and they go through a cognitive and emotional burden. Mental health in China needs earnest attention because about 12 out of 1,000 people reported having mental health-related issues (15). It is against the national plans to promote mental health among individuals (9). The most vulnerable group is those ranging from 15 to 24 years, and most of these are students at a school/college or a university (14). A survey by Beasley et al. (16) mentioned that 39% of college students face mental health-related issues. A study by Chai et al. (15) concluded that 43.7% of the students who participated in the study had experienced anxiety. At the same time, 22.6% had experienced depression due to a COVID19 pandemic and class-related matters. Hence, it is crucial to conduct research to explain and measure MHA among students and its impact on their practical learning. Moreover, it is also important to note what institutional support (IS) students have to become aware of their mental health through mental health literacy programs, and to what extent it influences the relationships between project-based learning (PBL), MHA, and effective English language learning.\nThe development of a country depends upon the quality of its academic institutions, and the COVID-19 pandemic has opened up new avenues for academic institutions to teach online and use PBL methods of teaching, which incorporate the use of technology, develops teamwork in the students by providing them enough time for discussion the assigned topics, and thoroughly understanding the topics. As a result, academic institutions must also develop systems to enhance academic performance (17). For students\u2019 effective learning, improvement in knowledge, creativity, opting for new teaching methods, and student participation are the key elements (18). According to Piaget\u2019s constructivist theory (19), learning occurs when individuals are stimulated toward interactions with others and get involved in social communication to pursue their knowledge development. Hence, to promote group learning, bringing fascinating and suitable content for class activities, the role of teachers becomes more significant because it enhances the learning capacity of students, and they learn more effectively (20). PBL enhances effective learning by introducing the subject videos and related projects in the class by which students can learn more (21). For effective learning of students, the teachers\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nmust be equipped with the necessary professional knowledge. Education is now replacing the orthodox teaching methods and using more novel approaches to give students hands-on experience with the subject (22). Therefore, student-centric teaching methods increase students\u2019 interest in learning and achieving the learning objectives, increasing students\u2019 learning satisfaction (23).\nTherefore, the current study aims to investigate the direct and indirect relationships between the variables empirically and proposes the below-given research questions (RQs): RQ1. What is the direct impact of PBL and MHA on EEL? RQ2. To what extent IS is related to the EEL of the students, and is the relationship between PBL, MHA, and EEL moderated by IS? The study primarily contributes to the literature by clarifying PBL from an educational standpoint. Secondly, our study investigates the effects of MHA on students\u2019 effective learning. The study provides empirical evidence that PBL and MHA positively affect students\u2019 effective learning. Finally, this paper examines the moderating role of IS between PBL, MHA, and effective English language teaching.\nLiterature review and hypotheses development"

            "heading": "Constructivist theory",
            "text": "Piaget (19) was the first scholar to introduce constructivism in academia, and the concept was based on cognitive development. This theory is based on the premise that people learn through observation and scientific techniques and then develop their understanding of the world around them. According to Piaget\u2019s constructivist theory (19), learning occurs when individuals are stimulated toward interactions with others and get involved in social communication to pursue their knowledge development. There are three basic requirements of constructivist theory, (1) The teachers\u2019 teaching methodology reflects effective learning. (2) Effective learning occurs when individuals adopt reality and behave as expected. (3) Effective learning occurs due to one\u2019s autonomous control over his/her mental health. Whereas Dtiscoll (24) described that knowledge could only exist in human knowledge, and it does not require to be matched with the realities of the world, humans keep updating this knowledge through their life experiences. Constructivist theory stimulates students\u2019 natural curiosity about the world around them and how things work. Constructivist learning theory is known to have three major streams. These three streams are individual, social, and collectivist learning streams. Our study uses the constructivist theory as an underpinning theory and develops the framework using individual learning.\nInclusive pedagogy in English language teaching\nStudent-centric teaching approaches focus on student learning, which results in effective learning. On the one hand, it is a very dynamic process and can take the forms of formal and informal learning. On the other hand, dull teaching methods, unchanging content, and lack of professional skills are also very static. It is a fact that learning develops awareness, morality, behavior, capabilities, and preferences about life. According to Forsey et al. (25), the process through which student gets the opportunity to participate in high-quality learning is known as practical learning. In high-quality education systems, results are connected to well-defined quantifiable learning standards that encourage students\u2019 learning. Students\u2019 effective learning is also measured when the instructors implement their vital academic objective targets and evaluate students within a specific timeframe (26). Such an evaluation system not only facilitates assessing their achievements and improving their effectiveness but also leads toward expanding educational programs (27). Such outcome-based education facilitates teachers and students in developing a shared understanding of the course\u2019s and program\u2019s learning objectives.\nSpecific technical aspects in the e-learning network, such as cognitive, instructional, and social representation, have been utilized to measure effective learning. Such design components foster high-level cognitive skills via deep learning and research. Effective learning addresses questions: \u201cAm I able to recall the material I have learned? Am I able to explain the material I have learned?\u201d Therefore, a learner\u2019s capacity to openly express what they have learned via quantitative methods is called effective learning. Prior studies have mentioned that learning brings changes to the advancement of students learning (25). In this study, learning outcomes are related to direct effects on learning through PBL (1).\nProject-based learning and effective English language teaching\nBesides the fact that scholars do not agree on a single definition of PBL, its advocates still agree on some of its fundamental aspects (28). According to Loyens et al. (29), the PBL method is a common collaborative and researchoriented learning strategy distinguished by active interaction with students and their relative learning. Based on the purpose it serves, PBL is divided into four categories: making a final product (Producer\u2019s Project); knowing a subject and enjoying its knowledge or experience (Consumer\u2019s Project); improving a specific technique or skill (Specific learning); solving a philosophical problem (Problem Project) (30). Kokotsaki et al. (31) mentioned that students taught using the PBL approach must work closely to find an optimum solution to a problem,\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org\nperform new product development for a defined audience, and then assess the project and its development process. The usage of the PBL method is a requirement of the modern age because it cultivates critical thinking skills, develops problem-solving, enhances interpersonal communication skills, leadership skills, teamwork through collaboration among the members, media literacy, and most importantly, encourages students to be more creative while proposing the solutions (32). A study by Mettas and Constantinou (26) examined the effects of PBL on students and teachers and found that PBL improves problemsolving competence. Another research found that PBL increased academic performance in both (33).\nResearch by Lavy and Shriki (34) concluded that PBL positively affects learning perception. Furthermore, an evaluation process is helpful for student instructors since it assists them in developing a clear understanding of their learning objectives, which can improve the educational development of the participants they supervise. Which is followed by the creation of opportunities for the students in the form of support in project selection, to study the complex issues, interact with a problem with complicated solutions, search for viable solutions, evaluate the patterns, and critically review their work for revisions, and finally coming up with a generic solution. In his research on teaching languages, Miller (35) mentioned that teachers using PBL as a teaching method are encouraged to obtain multiple instructional objectives like enhancing communication skills, mixing cultural studies with linguistics, developing relationships between the teaching material and the language, and comparing the pupils\u2019 first and the second languages. These assigned projects could be as small as just a selection of a research topic or as big as an exhibition, wall painting, theater performances, and dramas (36). Students\u2019 effective language learning through PBL is supported by many studies (1, 25).\nA study by Rohmahwati (37) investigated the PBL effects on the students\u2019 speaking ability, and the results mentioned that implementing the PBL method has positively increased the students\u2019 speaking ability. Moreover, the students of the speaking class also depicted a positive attitude toward the PBL implementation. Additionally, Marwan (38) did action research with 25 students from a vocational higher education institution, using PBL with information and communication technologies in an English classroom. The study\u2019s findings revealed that pupils become more motivated to utilize English. Furthermore, students had more fascinating and relevant learning in an English PBL session. Based on all the arguments mentioned above, we formulate the belowgiven premise.\nH1: Project-based learning positively influences EEL teaching.\nMental health awareness and effective English teaching\nThe ability of an individual to cope with stressful situations, work efficiently, and contribute to society for betterment. World Health Organization (39) has termed this state of wellbeing as mental health. MHA plays a vital role in building the capacity to achieve and maintain a constructive psychological state in dealing with difficulties and challenges of daily life. Improving MHA entails teaching people how to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental illness, which is essential for seeking help, receiving treatment, and implementing preventative measures (40). Keyes (41) model of MHA includes three components: psychological, social, and emotional wellbeing, and concluded that mental health is an individual\u2019s capacity to recognize and assess his/her affective states and psychological and social functioning. Howell (42) conducted an exploratory study to evaluate the student\u2019s learning in the university and consider psychological wellbeing as the MHA factor. It is because psychological wellbeing describes the approach to living and functioning effectively and actualizing human potential (i.e., Eudaimonia) (43), which is especially crucial to university functioning. It encompasses many Eudaimonia-related notions, such as self-acceptance, positive relationships with others, personal progress, life purpose, autonomy, environmental mastery (44), and relatedness, competence, engagement, and meaning (45).\nIndividuals facing mental health-related challenges are on the verge of disconnection from their daily activities, becoming less productive, more often having health concerns, and having a higher probability of being involved in an unforeseen event (46, 47). Preventive initiatives in avoiding mental health disorders are essential public health approaches for reducing mental disorders\u2019 health, social, and economic impact (48). Academic institutions possess the best intervention settings and can play the best part in it due to the fact the students spend most than half of the day studying at their academic institutions, and in case they seek any help or need any advice about their mental health issues, the administration and faculty/staff will be their first point of contact (49). Faculty or staff of academic institutions can easily approach students suffering from higher-order mental issues (50) and assess overall mental health services (51). Academic institutions can play a vital role in providing opportunities for MHA in the students because the absence of required awareness and knowledge about mental health issues can cause early mental health stigma in students, and they usually link this mental disorder with conflict and violence (52). Consequently, academic institutions must make efforts to increase the MHA of their students, which can boost their awareness and understanding of mental diseases and help in their detection, management, or prevention to improve\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 04 frontiersin.org\ntheir academic performance (53). Based on all the arguments mentioned above, we formulate the below-given premise.\nH2: Mental health awareness positively influences EEL teaching."

            "text": "According to LaMastro (54), the support service that academic institutions provide to the students to nurture and value contributions is called IS. From the compelling learning perspective, IS refers to the active support and assistance provided by institutions in the form of rules, regulations, and financial and non-financial assistance that motivate students to carry out their obligations in a highly effective and efficient manner. Research conducted by Rhoades (55) explained that individuals get motivated on a volunteer basis to embrace the IS system, and Celep and Yilmazturk (56) confirmed that IS does affect commitment. A study investigated the impact of IS on teacher responsiveness and student satisfaction and performance, discovering that IS had a favorable influence on student performance and satisfaction (57).\nPeople become confident after believing they receive continuous IS and achieve their performance goals (58). Along the same line, Yildirim et al. (59) emphasized a need for training and IS for using learning management systems in educational institutions. One important thing to be noticed is that access to a help desk, which is functional, user-friendly, and provides all the necessary support and guidance, can make learning exciting and compelling (60, 61). If handled effectively, it can assist in establishing enduring communal bonds between students, improving students\u2019 learning results. Students and teachers require a supportive atmosphere regarding PBL, excellent facilities, resource access, and equipment utilization. Based on the findings of Abdullah and Primus (62) regarding the dearth of specific indigenous support centers in Malaysian public universities, institutional assistance substantially impacts student participation. It is, therefore, proposed that students taught using PBL as a teaching method and awareness of mental health are more likely to perform better if there is institutional and organizational support. Figure 1 shows the research model of the study.\nH3: Institutional support moderates the relationship between PBL and EEL, so the positive relationship will be stronger when the IS is high.\nH4: Institutional support moderates the relationship between MHA and EEL, such that the positive relationship will be stronger when the IS is high."

As a result, the current study used the same data gathering strategy. The scale questions were collected from past studies with careful attention and face validity to gather data from respondents. The research adopted a nine-item measure for MHA from the study of Rush and Grouzet (63).\nFurther, the six scale items for students\u2019 effective English language teaching were adopted from the study of Tang and Chaw (64). In the same way, the 10 scale items for PBL were adopted from the study Shin (65). Lastly, the three scale items for IS were adopted from the study Abdullah and Primus (62). In this way, the scale item for MHA was taken to determine the relationship between MHA and effective English language teaching for the students. Understanding that MHA plays a critical role in people\u2019s mental development and awareness is critical. Also, these scale items were previously used by different studies to understand the role of mental health education in the better performance of the student\u2019s in-class activities.\nSimilarly, the scale questions for students\u2019 MHA were carefully chosen to recognize the importance of students\u2019 psychological wellbeing. To adequately quantify the link, this study used scale items that were carefully chosen.

Keeping the study objectives in mind, we examined the usage of the PBL teaching methodology among the students learning English and tried to understand its effects on their effective learning. The results of our empirical research indicate that the usage of PBL in teaching increased effective English language learning in the students. The results indicate that the PBL method builds English language-related capabilities in students.

As also noted by H\u00e4kkinen et al. (32) that PBL approaches make students ready to face the challenges in their daily life and perform better under demanding situations. Our findings also align with (69\u201371), who mentioned that developing students\u2019 understanding using PBL methodology improves the educational learning of media and information and thus improves their academic performance.\nAdditionally, the findings of this study are empirical evidence showing that the teachers and students of this era consider PBL an essential element. PBL ensures that students can manage their academic workload and improves\nTABLE 3 Discriminant validity.\nMSV MHA PBL IS EEL\nMHA 0.08 0.729 PBL 0.08 0.283*** 0.766 IS 0.014 0.051 0.118\u2020 0.814 EEL 0.02 0.012 \u22120.143* 0.052 0.699\nSignificance of correlations: \u2020p< 0.100; *p< 0.050; ***p< 0.001.\ntheir learning environment simultaneously. The connection in the PBL approach helps students achieve their academic objectives, simplifies things, and preserves the relationship between students and professors.\nIn order to better understand students\u2019 approaches to achieving academic goals, another objective of the study was to test the relationship between MHA and EEL. According to this study, students having MHA said they had succeeded in their goals. According to the findings above, students with solid MHA can adjust to their surroundings, and MHA sparks a drive to improve themselves favorably. Additionally, those with good MHA have intense emotional, personality, and physical traits that enable them to adjust to any stressors that may arise in their surroundings. The findings indicate that individuals with mental awareness realize they are competent and can perform classroom activities, feel energized while interacting in class, and quickly adapt to new situations. They are aware of whatever they are doing. These findings align with Granlund\u2019s results (72), as they explained that individuals with good MHA not only harness the potential to develop the abilities to cope with the pressures of life and perform better, but their contribution to the community gets improved.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org\nTABLE 4 Measurement model fitness values.\nCFA indicator Threshold value\nInitial model\nModified model\nCMIN/DF \u22643 5.29 1.908\nGFI \u22650.80 0.835 0.87\nAGFI \u22650.80 0.776 0.841\nCFI \u22650.90 0.913 0.95\nRMSEA \u22640.08 0.1 0.056\nNFI \u22650.90 0.913 0.901\nTLI \u22650.90 0.896 0.943\nIFI \u22650.90 0.914 0.95\nPCLOSE >0.05 0.000 0.080\nSRMR <0.08 0.091 0.064\nThe MAH is all about initiating preventive actions in case of any mental problem identification and, to manage it, taking instant control over it for better handling without being ashamed. One easy way to be literate about mental health-related matters is to acquire knowledge and information through media about several disorders, management, and\nrestraints for mental health-related issues. Fitri (14) mentioned that individuals with the MHA and capability to maintain adequate self-mental health status. Therefore, MHA goes beyond simply grasping the basics of MHA; instead, it is also about convictions necessary to cultivate favorable attitudes about the significance of mental wellness (73).\nThis study also examined IS influencing relationships between PBL and MHA. The study found that IS helps individuals with relatively good PBL and MHA. If the level of IS increases, the relationship between PBL and EEL strengthens. Simultaneously, the strength of the relationship between MHA and EEL increases. The findings unmistakably imply that IS mechanisms can significantly promote students\u2019 effective English language learning. The results indicated that academic institutions provide support services like communities to make friends, learn new skills, enjoy campus life, perform volunteer activities, peer support, mentorship programs, academic support services, and lecture support in terms of advice from academic staff/faculty.\nConsequently, enhancing effective student learning requires more IS that could be monetary (scholarships, funding, stipends etc.) or non-monetary (academic counseling, clubs, societies,\nFIGURE 2 Structural equation modeling (SEM) results of direct effects.\nFIGURE 3 Moderation results (H3).\nstudent community centers, volunteer services etc.) must be provided available and easily accessible to all students. Our research findings match those of previous researchers (55, 57, 58). The positive influence of IS was found to develop an online learning system of education (59)."

            "text": "Project-based learning requires students to solve issues together with their peers. PBL allows students to share knowledge (i.e., peer learning). Maraj (74) reported that many students feel that learning from others increases their grasp of the subject being studied. It is evident from this scoping study that PBL gives students the skills and knowledge necessary for successful PBL and efficient learning. According to studies, positive academic accomplishment is correlated with solid cooperative abilities, MHA, and institutional assistance (75, 76). The moderation result directs policymakers in China to pay heed to provide adequate IS to learners and instructors. The effects of PBL and MHA in the classroom on efficient student learning were investigated in this study. The study\u2019s findings might benefit learners by fostering comfort, healthy development, and simple learning. In order to support all children\u2019s academic growth, we also looked at research on how educators may respond to various degrees of adaptation, handle adversity, and develop resilience. Likely, learning styles do not exist in how their proponents see them, making it hard to recognize them in pupils and instruct them accordingly. By working in groups and using PBL, students learn more. Some respondents said they were dealing with mental health issues and that this was affecting their academic performance. According to the previous study, academics can better plan their class activities to prevent and minimize the many mental health difficulties that students may experience by realizing that such issues impair students\u2019 learning (74). Another option for policymakers is creating a channel to support students who\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 10 frontiersin.org\noffer volunteer activities. Student clubs and societies can offer instruction, encourage learning, and generate opportunities for their peers."

            "text": "This scoping review aims to document current PBL practices that are effective. It was highlighted that given the new finding on effective learning behavior, a sizable number of articles within this period were determined to be pertinent to PBL. The study\u2019s sample is one potential factor that could restrict the results\u2019 external validity. In our sample, five universities in Harbin, Heilongjiang, were chosen, but there is no clear target demographic. The fact that we only evaluated the one form of PBL extensively covered earlier in the text represents another study limitation. There may be significant differences between this instantiation and other people\u2019s ideas of PBL.\nAdditionally, we focused on generally healthy senior citizens in the community, which may have limitations on generalizability and practical uses. The study employed a crosssectional methodology and only collected data at one point, often seen as less accurate than data acquired from the same respondents several times. Thus, conducting longitudinal data analysis in subsequent research would be preferable. Future studies on the most efficient learning strategies to apply in academic situations should consider the opinions of instructors and other higher education partners. Advice on how to integrate the learning method into other areas of learners\u2019 learning stages in the future should be given to teachers. Future studies may give further insight into addressing the problem in academic settings. Researchers can keep looking for measurement-related errors when going through the literature on effective learning, and they can also add other factors into the framework, like gamebased learning and cooperative learning (1). Future studies can also study it from cognitive and social perspectives (41). Furthermore, we did not use the demographic information for any deep analysis; future studies can use such respondents\u2019 characteristics to conduct group analysis and take deep insights."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "This study showed a positive relationship between PBL, students\u2019 MHA, and effective learning. Although PBL has a direct positive effect on students\u2019 effective learning and IS, it has a more significant effect on their performance in formal classes. Furthermore, the role of IS in the relationship between students\u2019 MHA and their effective learning is also significantly and positively strengthened when IS is increased. PBL approaches in academic settings, based on our findings, develop and improve the abilities of students to learn effectively. It also develops cooperation with group members, teamwork spirit,\nand ideas sharing in group settings. PBL also is equally essential for the teachers as it facilitates the teachers in establishing a better understanding of the student\u2019s academic situation. Academic institutions may be able to take advantage of the resources already there in the student body itself and stop more long-term suffering by changing the way they view this as a \u201cdetriment\u201d or \u201cvulnerability\u201d to campus mental health efforts and instead of viewing it as a \u201cstrength\u201d in these efforts. Additionally, this study is the first to our knowledge that offers a model linking MHA and EEL through the moderating role of IS for effective learning. In this regard, academic institutions should deliberately maximize IS as it increases their degree and learning."
