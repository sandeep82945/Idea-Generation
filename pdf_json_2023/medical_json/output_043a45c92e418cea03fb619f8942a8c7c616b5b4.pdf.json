    "abstractText": "Background: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in the young (under 50). Defining the clinicopathological features and cancer-specific outcomes of patients with early-onset CRC is important to optimize screening and treatment strategies. This study evaluated diseasespecific features and oncological outcomes of patients with early-onset CRC. Methods: Anonymized data from an international collaboration were analyzed. The inclusion criteria for this study were patients aged <50 years with stage I-III disease surgically resected with curative intent. Overall and disease-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Results: A total of 3378 patients were included, with a median age of 43 (18\u201349) and a slight male preponderance (54.3%). One-third had a family history of colorectal cancer. Almost all (>95%) of patients were symptomatic at diagnosis. The majority (70.1%) of tumors were distal to the descending colon. Approximately 40% were node positive. Microsatellite instability was demonstrated in one in five patients, representing 10% of rectal and 27% of colon cancers. A defined inherited syndrome was diagnosed in one-third of those with microsatellite instability. Rectal cancer displayed a worse prognosis stage for stage. Five-year disease-free survival for stage I, II, and III colon cancer was 96%, 91%, and 68%, respectively. The equivalent rates for rectal cancer were 91%, 81%, and 62%. Conclusions and relevance: The majority of EOCRC would be captured with flexible sigmoidoscopy. Extending screening to young adults and public health education initiatives are potential interventions to improve survivorship.",

            "text": "Although the overall incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) have decreased globally since the introduction of population-based screening, there has been a significant rise in incidence among adults aged less than 50 years. Early age onset CRC (EOCRC) now represents the second most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in this age group [1]. Similar trends have been observed in Europe and North America, with the greatest increase in distal colon and rectal cancers [2\u20135]. Analysis of 143 million people from 20 European countries showed CRC incidence has increased by 7.9% per year among subjects aged 20\u201329 years, by 4.9% among those aged 30\u201339 years,\nCancers 2023, 15, 2979. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112979 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers\nand by 1.6% among those aged 40\u201349 years from 2004 to 2016 [2]. Based on current data, it is estimated that within the next decade, 1 in 4 rectal cancers and 1 in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in individuals under 50 [4]. The factors driving these escalating trends are unclear. Although more likely to occur in the context of a hereditary cancer syndrome, the majority of EOCRCs are sporadic [6\u20138]. Environmental and lifestyle factors such as diet, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption in isolation do not explain the observed trends. Importantly, EOCRC represents a global phenomenon and affects both genders. Potential risk factors hypothesized include obesity, infections, antibiotics, and alterations to the gut microbiome [9]. The clinicopathological characteristics of EOCRC differ from those of late-onset disease. EOCRC typically involves the distal colon or rectum, presents at an advanced disease stage, and displays unfavorable histological features such as poor differentiation, mucin, and signet-ring morphology [10\u201312]. These differences may be associated with different survival. Survival data for young patients are lacking and conflicting, and despite increased use of neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment among patients with EOCRC sensitivity to conventional chemo(radio)therapy is unknown [12\u201314]. Unique tumor biology may influence response to treatment, and age at diagnosis is not considered in modern therapeutic strategies. The long-term effects of chemoradiotherapy on quality of life and fertility are of particular importance in this patient group. The potential overtreatment of patients with low-risk diseases must be questioned in the absence of a definitive oncological benefit. Although increasing in incidence, EOCRC accounts for a very small proportion of CRCs overall. Individual institutional data alone are of limited value in addressing the big questions that surround this disease. Whilst a huge body of data on older patients with CRC exists, data relating to young patients is relatively lacking. Thus, the Research in Early Age Colorectal Cancer Trends (REACCT) Collaborative was established to combine data from institutions worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the disease-specific features as well as oncological outcomes of patients diagnosed with CRC aged less than 50 years."

Rectal cancer and tumors of the colon were evaluated separately. Rectal cancer was defined as tumors within 15 cm from the anal verge on colonoscopy. Clinical staging was according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system. Chemotherapy was administered according to institutional protocol and the multidisciplinary team. Details pertaining to the decision-making or whether patients were enrolled in a clinical trial were not recorded. Microsatellite instability was identified by PCR or by loss of mismatch repair proteins, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 on immunohistochemistry. The term MSI is used throughout for consistency. The definition of hereditary cancer syndrome was a diagnosis of a constitutive pathogenic variant on germline testing."

DFS was modestly better in those patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer (log-rank 2.84, p = 0.092); a larger sample size would be needed to achieve statistical significance.

In the present series, there was a modest male preponderance, most patients had a normal BMI, and one-third had a family history of CRC. In keeping with previously published data, the majority of tumors (70%) were located in the sigmoid colon and rectum [4,15\u201317]. Why young adults are disproportionately affected by a distal colon and rectal cancer is unclear, and deciphering the aetiology of rectal versus colon cancer will be key to developing preventative strategies [18,19]. Importantly, tumor location guides optimum screening methods. Flexible sigmoidoscopy should capture the majority of EOCRCs, representing a potential screening tool with family history-based risk assessment as an adjunct. EOCRC is more frequently associated with adverse histopathological features and more advanced disease at diagnosis relative to late-onset disease [10,12,20]. In this study, the proportions of patients with lymphovascular invasion, extramural venous invasion, perineural invasion, and node-positive disease were higher compared to those reported in older patients [21\u201324]. Advanced disease stage may reflect aggressive tumor biology and/or be due to a delay from symptom onset to diagnosis, either patient or physician related [25,26]. The vast majority of patients were symptomatic, highlighting the importance of educational initiatives to raise awareness among young adults, primary care physicians, and clinicians and ensure timely diagnosis and intervention. Survival data for patients with EOCRC are conflicting. Despite advanced disease stage and unfavorable histopathological features, some studies report equivalent oncological outcomes, whilst others report better survival among young patients [22,27\u201331]. In the present study, rectal cancer displayed a worse prognosis with 5-year DFS rates of 91%, 81%,\nand 62% for stages I, II, and III, respectively, compared to 96%, 91%, and 68% for those with colon cancer. These survival data are comparable to those of stage-matched older patients. Considerable heterogeneity in survival has been observed in those under 50, supporting further age-based subgrouping in future studies [32]. Young patients are more likely to receive neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy and to receive multi-agent regimes at all stages compared to their older counterparts, despite no significant gain in adjusted survival [12,14,33,34]. They are also more likely to receive systemic therapy outside National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines [12,13,28,29]. In the present series, just over one in three patients with stage I/II rectal cancer received neoadjuvant therapy, whilst one-third of patients with stage II colon or rectal cancer received adjuvant chemotherapy. The sensitivity of EOCRC to conventional chemotherapy is unclear, as young patients account for a small proportion of clinical trials. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a modest improvement in DFS among patients with stage III colon cancer in the present series. A larger sample size would be needed to demonstrate statistical significance. Interestingly, worse DFS was observed in patients with stage II disease who received adjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting the presence of unfavorable histopathological features. Similarly, patients with stage III rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy had worse DFS than those who did not. Alternative or adjunctive oncotherapeutic strategies such as total neoadjuvant therapy or immunotherapy may optimize survivorship [35,36]. The estimated prevalence of hereditary cancer syndromes in EOCRC ranges between 5 and 35%, compared to 2\u20135% of CRCs overall [6\u20138]. In the present study, MSI was identified as 1 in 5 patients (27% of colon cancers and 10% of rectal cancers). A hereditary cancer syndrome was diagnosed in just over 1 in 3 patients with colon cancer and 1 in 4 with rectal cancer, highlighting the importance of reflex genetic testing in patients with MSI EOCRC. The therapeutic implication of MSI is the potential for immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade, with remarkable success observed in the neoadjuvant setting [36\u201338]. Although genetic predisposition plays an important role in EOCRC, it must be acknowledged that the majority of patients have sporadic disease [39,40]. Thus, screening patients with a family history or known genetic predisposition will only capture a small proportion of patients with EOCRC. Furthermore, the majority of patients are symptomatic at diagnosis. As symptoms such as abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, etc., frequently overlap with benign conditions, public health initiatives are needed to raise awareness and educate both physicians and patients about the risk of CRC in young adults. Screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy would identify the majority of patients who develop EOCRC. Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature, data heterogeneity, and variable treatment algorithms across the collaborative group. However, this study presents real-world data relating to a disease that has been, until recently, relatively uncommon in the young age group. The patients in the present study were not directly compared to older patients, as a large volume of evidence for older patients already exists. Future studies should focus on deciphering the optimum oncotherapeutic management of patients with EOCRC."

Patients with rectal cancer displayed worse fiveyear disease-free survival stage for stage. MSI was present in 20.0% (1 in 4 colon cancers and 1 in 10 rectal cancers). Approximately one-third of patients with MSI tumors (colonic and rectal) were diagnosed with a definable hereditary cancer syndrome.
