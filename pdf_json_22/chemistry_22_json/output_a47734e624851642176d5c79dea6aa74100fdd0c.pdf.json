    "abstractText": "A novel series of silibinin and 2,3-dehydrosilybin derivatives bearing carbamate groups were designed, synthesized and their in vitro anticancer activities were screened against human cancer cell lines including MCF-7, NCI-H1299, HepG2 and HT29 by CCK-8 assay. The results showed that most of the compounds significantly suppressed the proliferation of tested cancer cells. Among them, compounds 2h, 3h and 3f demonstrated markedly higher antiproliferative activity on MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 2.08, 5.54 and 6.84 \u03bcM, respectively. Compounds 3e, 3g and 2g displayed better cytotoxic activity against NCI-H1299 cells with IC50 values of 8.07, 8.45 and 9.09 \u03bcM, respectively. Compounds 3g, 3c and 3h exhibited a promising inhibitory effect against HepG2 cells with IC50 values of 8.88, 9.47 and 9.99 \u03bcM, respectively. Compounds 3e, 2e and 3c revealed effective biological potency on HT29 cells with IC50 values of 6.27, 9.13 and 9.32 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition, the outcomes of the docking studies between compounds 2f, 2h, 3e, 3g and Hsp90 receptor (PDB ID: 4AWO) suggest the possible mechanism of inhibition against MCF-7 cell lines.",

It is estimated that there are approximately19.3 million new cancer cases in 2020 across the world, and These authors contributed equally: Qiuchan Wu, Jiang Zeng, Jinfu Dong\n* Jinfu Dong dongjinfu@163.com\n1 Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital, Tianjin 300450, China\n2 Department of Pharmacy, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Liuzhou 545005, China\n3 Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Central South University, No. 172 Tongzipo Road, Changsha, Hunan 410013, China\nSupplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s00044022-02854-6.\n12 34\n56 78\n90 () ;,: 12 34 56 78 90 (); ,:\nthis number will surge remarkably to 28.4 million in 2040 [3]. Natural products have been widely investigated and eventually developed into drugs, especially anticancer chemotherapeutics due to their molecular diversity and novelty [4, 5]. Silymarin is an active extract isolated from the seeds of the milk thistle plant, Silybum marianum, which contains approximately 65\u201380% flavonolignans (silybinin, isosilybin, silychristin, silydianin, 2,3-dehydrosilybin) with small amounts of flavonoids and about 20\u201330% of unidentified polymeric phenolic components [6\u20138]. Silibinin, the main active ingredient of silymarin, is a roughly 1:1 mixture of two diastereoisomers named as silybin A (SLB A) and silybin B (SLB B), while the 2,3- dehydrosilybin (DHS) consists of a mixture of two enantiomers, namely, DHS A and DHS B [9] (Fig. 1). Silibinin and DHS have been shown to possess anticancerogenic and proapoptotic activity both in vitro and in vivo [10]. Silibinin, as positive control, exhibits anticancer activity with typical IC50 value of around 50\u2013200 \u03bcM in various cancers [11, 12], while at lower concentrations, DHS induces apoptosis at 30\u201350 \u03bcM when treated alone [13]. Encouragingly, silybin is currently under phase II clinical trials in the US for prostate cancer treatment [14]. Despite these encouraging results, their\nuse as an antitumor drug is considerably hampered by their small solubility in water which caused by highly hydrophobic characteristic and low acidity [15\u201319]. To improve the druggability and enhance antiproliferative activity of silibinin and DHS, structural modifications are essential [20, 21].\nOrganic carbamates are structural motifs of many approved pharmaceutical drugs [22, 23], such as Encorafenib (approved in 2018), Cobicistat (approved in 2013), Irinotecan (approved in 1994), etc (Fig. 2). Structurally, partly owing to the amide-ester hybrid nature, the carbamate functional group displays good chemical and proteolytic stabilities [24]. Furthermore, carbamates have been demonstrated to have the ability to promote interand intramolecular interactions with the biological targets. In addition, numerous studies have indicated that structural modifications by introducing carbamate groups greatly improve the water solubility and biological activity of the drugs [25\u201330]. Based on the above information, a class of silibinin and 2,3-DHS derivatives bearing carbamate groups were designed and synthesized. Their antiproliferative activities were investigated and the structure-activity relationships (SARs) were discussed."

The reaction of silybin and carbamyl chloride 1a-i in the presence of N,Ndiisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent produced the desired product 2a\u2013i in yields of 10.8\u201352.8%. When the reaction base and the solvent were replaced by potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), mono-substituted 2,3-DHS derivatives 3a\u2013i were produced in yields of 11.2\u201339.9%. Surprisingly, disubstituted 2,3-DHS derivatives 4a and 4b were also synthesized selectively with yields of 11.1 and 27.7%, respectively, by simply increasing the amount of K2CO3 and carbamyl chloride 1a-b. Twenty novel silibinin and 2,3-DHS derivatives bearing carbamate groups were synthesized, and their structures were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectroscopy. As expected, it was found that all target compounds exhibited substantially higher aqueous solubility compared with untreated silibinin and DHS."

The IC50 values of the compounds against the tested cell lines are summarized in Table 1. Silibinin and 2,3-DHS were used as control, which exhibited poor antiproliferative activity against all the four types of cancer cells with almost all IC50 values >20 \u00b5M. As expected, compared with positive drugs, most of their derivatives bearing carbamate groups exhibited significantly enhanced antitumor activity against the tested tumour cell lines. The majority of the compounds demonstrated antitumor activity with IC50 values at low micromolar concentrations. In particular, a series of derivatives exhibited potency in the single-digit micromolar range, such as compounds 2h, 3h, 3f, 3g, 4b, 4a and 2g showed better cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 2.08, 5.54, 6.84, 7.96, 8.05, 8.06 and 8.24 \u00b5M, compounds 3e, 3g and 2g displayed high antiproliferative activity against NCI-H1299 cells with IC50 values of 8.07, 8.45 and 9.09 \u00b5M, compounds 3g, 3c and 3h revealed effective biological potency on HepG2 cells with IC50 values of 8.88, 9.47 and 9.99 \u00b5M, compounds 3e, 2e, 3c and 2f exhibited a promising inhibitory effect against HT29 cells with IC50 values of 6.27, 9.13, 9.32 and 9.86 \u00b5M, respectively. Among the twenty screened compounds, seven compounds (2f, 2g, 3b, 3e, 3g, 4a and 4b) have exhibited superior potency in anticancer activity on all tested cell lines. Especially compound 2g (MCF-7 IC50= 8.24 \u00b5M, NCI-H1299 IC50= 9.09 \u00b5M, HepG2 IC50= 13.96 \u00b5M, HT29 IC50= 10.80 \u00b5M) and 3g (MCF-7\nScheme 1 Synthesis of carbamate-containing silibinin and 2,3-dehydrosilybin derivatives\nIC50= 7.96 \u00b5M, NCI-H1299 IC50= 8.45 \u00b5M, HepG2 IC50 = 8.88 \u00b5M, HT29 IC50= 17.23 \u00b5M) have demonstrated stronger broad-spectrum antitumor activities.\nSubstituent R plays a crucial role in the biological activity of this group of drugs. According to the structureactivity relationship study, the N,N-dimethylcarbamate\nderivative 2b (18.45 \u00b5M), the N,N-diethyl carbamate analogue 2d (13.02 \u00b5M), and the N,N-diisopropylcarbamate substitute 2g (9.09 \u00b5M) showed a trend toward more potent anticancer activity against NCI-H1299 cells with increasing lipophilicity of the carbamate residues in the molecule. The same tendency in cyclic carbamate derivatives was also observed, with the pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate derivative 3e (14.24 \u00b5M), the piperidine-1-carboxylate analogue 3f (6.84 \u00b5M), and the [1,4\u2032-bipiperidine]-1\u2032-carboxylate substitute 3h (5.54 \u00b5M) showed increasing cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells, indicating positive effect of the lipophilic substituents on the activity of these compounds. The derivatives bearing morpholine-4-carboxylate group 2a and 3a generally exhibited much higher IC50 values (all >20 \u00b5M) comparing to compounds bearing the piperidine-1carboxylate group 2f and 3f, which indicated that the additional oxygen atom in the morpholino group interferes greatly with the antiproliferative activities. More interestingly, C3-OH and C7-OH disubstituted derivative of 2,3- DHS 4a (MCF-7 IC50= 8.06 \u00b5M, NCI-H1299 IC50= 13.10 \u00b5M, HepG2 IC50= 16.51 \u00b5M, HT29 IC50= 12.44 \u00b5M) exhibited significantly stronger inhibition potency than C7-OH mono-substituted analogue 3a (all IC50s > 20 \u00b5M), which suggested that the double simultaneous substitution strategy is a promising approach in improving anticancer activity. Moreover, it was observed\nthat silibinin derivatives 2a\u20132h had similar activity with the corresponding analogues of 2,3-DHS 3a\u20133h against NCIH1299 cells, which suggested that dehydrogenation of silibinin derivatives at both 2- and 3-positions (CHCH\u2192C=C) had limited the influences on the antiproliferative activities, especially toward target NCIH1299 cells.\nMolecular docking studies Regarding to the molecular mechanisms of silibinininduced apoptosis in breast cancer (MCF-7), numerous studies have reported multiple biological targets, such as Hsp90 [31, 32], BCL-2 [33], ERK [34], Akt [34], COX-2 [35], MMP-9 [35, 36], etc. The docking studies of the silibinin and 2,3-DHS analogues (2f, 2h, 3e and 3g) were conducted against six protein kinases to investigate the putative mechanism of actions of these novel compounds by MOE. The outcomes of the docking studies showed comparatively higher docking scores against the Hsp90 (4AWO) so that it was chosen for virtual screening study. The results indicated that, 2h bound strongly to Hsp90 receptor with minimum binding energy \u22129.88 kcal/ mol, while the binding energy of 2f, 3e and 3g are \u22128.91, \u22128.39 and \u22129.11 kcal/mol, respectively.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3, docking results revealed that the silibinin analogue 2h had eight H\u2010bond interactions with the residues Ser52, Leu48, Ile104, Asn51, Asn106, Gly97,\nThr184 and Lys58 at distances of 3.39, 3.05, 3.32, 2.68, 3.24, 2.82, 2.90 and 3.34 \u00c5 in the ligand\u2010binding pocket, respectively. Similarly, 2f-Hsp90 cluster showed six H-bonds with Met98, Gly97, Met98, Thr184, Lys58 and Phe138 amino acids at distances of 4.16 (12CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S bond), 2.87, 3.88 (33CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S bond), 3.21, 3.13 and 4.62 \u00c5, respectively. Four major H-bonds were formed on Ile104, Asn106, Lys58 and Asn51 amino acid residues for compound 3e with distances of 3.29, 3.25, 3.41 and 3.93 \u00c5, respectively. In addition, 3g established four H-bonds with Asp93, Asn106, Ile104 and Asn51 amino acids with the corresponding distances being 3.33, 2.82, 3.31 and 3.85 \u00c5, respectively. The docking results are in good agreement with in vitro experimental IC50 values against MCF-7 cells shown in Table 1."

Importantly, compounds 2h, 3g, 3c and 3e displayed as low as single-digit micromolar activity against different cancer cell lines. Molecular docking between compound 2f, 2h, 3e, 3g and Hsp90 were in good agreement with in vitro experimental IC50 values against MCF-7 cell lines, which disclosed the possible mechanisms of anticancer action.

In brief, a suspension of cells (around 5000 cells per well for MCF-7, NCI-H1299, HepG2 and HT29) was inoculated into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then, solutions (PBS buffer containing 1% DMSO) of the prepared compounds and control drugs at a series of concentrations were added into the 96-well plates. After incubation for another 48 h, 10 \u03bcL of CCK-8 solution was added into each well and the plates were again incubated at 37 \u00b0C for another 2 h. The optical density (OD) values were measured using a microplate reader at 450 nm and expressed as IC50 values which was calculated with SPSS."

For preparing the protein receptors, the hydrogen atoms were added into the X-ray structure and the Triangle Matcher-force field was employed. The site sphere was determined based on the binding location of XL888 in Hsp90. The ligand XL888 and water were removed from the binding site, and compound 2f, 2h, 3e, 3g was docked into the prepared site in Hsp90, respectively. After evaluating the types of interactions between the tested compounds and Hsp90, the final binding conformation in Hsp90 was confirmed based on the calculated energy.\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest The authors declare no competing interests.\nPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."
