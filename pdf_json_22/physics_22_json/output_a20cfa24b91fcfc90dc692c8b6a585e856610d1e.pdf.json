Thanks to the 2\u2010layer\u2010multilayer\u2010perceptron structure, the inversion of matrix is performed to obtain the coupling ratio of the directional couplers and the phase delay of the phase modulators. The electro\u2010optical OR, AND, XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR gates are demonstrated. Moreover, we not only study the results under the ideal condition of device, but also discuss the imperfect situation with 1% error of fabrication or operation to study the tolerance of this system. Through our simulation results, the visibility of the gate output can be higher than 0.83. The gates can be fabricated in a silicon\u2010based chip to develop the integrated optics computing system.",

Thanks to the 2\u2011layer\u2011multilayer\u2011perceptron structure, the inversion of matrix is performed to obtain the coupling ratio of the directional couplers and the phase delay of the phase modulators.

Through our simulation results, the visibility of the gate output can be higher than 0.83. The gates can be fabricated in a silicon\u2011based chip to develop the integrated optics computing system.\nOptical computing is a striking issue in recent years. The logic gates are the fundamental devices to carry out this task1. All-optical logic gates based on photonic crystal (PC) waveguides, and ring resonators were proposed recently2\u20134. Also, there are many all-optical structures proposed to demonstrate the all-optical reservoir computing devices5\u20138. Thanks to the progress of the photonic technology which have been investigated intensively in recent decades, we can make these devices as a tiny chip9\u201312. Moreover, the temporal solitons and the continuouswave light sources were used as the carriers of the input and output signals. The refractive index change of the waveguide by means of non-linear Kerr effect with high power light beam produces the tuning or switching of the output states of logic gates13,14. However, a long propagation path around several micrometers or even millimeters through the dielectric waveguides to deliver the light from light source to the logic gates might not be avoidable in a dielectric material (such as silicon) chip. The light might be absorbed by the waveguides leading to the deformation of the solitons. The low absorption and dispersion waveguides such as the hollow waveguide or using 3-dimensional PC structure over the waveguide might be considered to connect the light sources and the logic gates as well as to connect between the logic gates15\u201317.\nActive components such as a tri-mode laser, Fabry\u2013Perot laser, and semiconductor saturable absorber had also been proposed to form the all-optical logic gates14,18,19. Through tuning the optical injection of the tri-mode lasers, the change of logical state can be achieved14. High-speed all-optical logic gates at the bit rate of 340\u00a0Gb/s using the cross-gain modulation in semiconductor optical amplifier has also been achieved19.\nRecently, researchers proposed the logic gates which are formed by microring/microdisk modulator20,21. Although the microring-/microdisk-modulators are tinier than our logic gate, the control process is more complicated than our design. With regard to the microring-modulator logic gates, they can achieve only AND, OR and XOR gates20. However, they need to modify the optical structure to carry out the corresponding function. In our study, we only need to tune the coupling ratio of the directional couplers and the phase of the phase shifter to achieve 6 logic gates at the single output port. For microdisk-modulator logic gates, the authors also can achieve OR, NOR, XNOR, XOR, AND and NAND logic gates21. However, the tunable laser providing 3 different wavelengths should be used. The size of the laser source and the external cavity to tune the wavelength might occupy several hundred square micrometers or even several square millimeters. The dimension of the integrated chip could be similar to that of our design.\nIn our previous work, we took advantage of the reservoir computing (RC) and unsupervised learning method optical neuron networks to establish an XOR gate5. This XOR gate with low bit error ratio was obtained by scanning the delay of optical phase shifter. In the present work, an electro-optical (EO) logic gates based on RC without the recurrent property are proposed. Obviously, it is a 2-layer-multilayer-perceptron (2-layer MLP) structure. This logic gates are composed of the optical amplifiers, directional couplers (DCs), and phase modulators (PMs). Comparing this new logic gates to our previous works, the feedback signal (the recurrent property)\nOPEN\n1Department of Electronic Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung 411030, Taiwan. 2Department of Optics and Photonics, National Central University, Zhongli 320317, Taiwan. *email: trich@dop.ncu.edu.tw\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:14203 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18408-0\nis removed in this new design. The switching time between 0 and 1 for the output of the gates can be shortened. In this work, the matrix inversion is performed to calculate the coupling ratio of the DCs and the phase delay of the PMs using the target output of the logic gates in the same optical configuration. The reconfigurable electrooptical OR, AND, XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR gates formed by one optical structure are demonstrated."

This system is composed of the input weight matrix Win , the recurrent weight matrix W , and the readout matrix Wout . The input matrix Win is used to scale the size of the input data to the size of the matrix W. The value of the elements in Win and W is chosen randomly. In this study, the learning is completed in a single pass-through training data. The optimal readout matrix Wout is used to generate the output of the RC system.\nIn RC system, the neuron can be described as a function of the current input and its previous calculation result which can be expressed by25\nwhere the function f is the nonlinear activation function of the neuron. Usually, the hyperbolic tangent function, tanh(), is used as the nonlinear activation function to converge the output value of neuron within \u2212\u00a01 and 126. In this research, the non-linear function of our optical neuron is provided by the optical amplifiers. (The optical setup is shown in Fig.\u00a01.) L is the leaky rate which is a real number from 0 to 1. However, since we do not use the recurrent property of RC in the optical neural network, L and W are set to be 1 and null, respectively producing a 2-layer MLP structure. u(n) represents the n-th input data.

As we mentioned above, once we obtain the elements of Wout , we could deduce the coupling ratio and phase in our DCs and PMs, respectively.

            "text": "Figure\u00a01 illustrates the optical setup of our EO neural-network-based logic gates. The CW laser source at the wavelength of 1550\u00a0nm with the power of 0.1\u00a0W is launched into the DCin of our logic gate. The optical nonlinear effect of the optical fibers which connect the optical devices are ignored. This DCin with the coupling ratio of 50% is used to divide equally the input light into two light beams. The two light beams are launched into the two phase modulators (PMA and PMB in Fig.\u00a01) individually. The half-wave voltage V\u03c0 of the PMA and PMB is set randomly to be 1\u00a0V and 2\u00a0V, respectively. The input signals A and B are applied on the phase modulators PMA and PMB, respectively. The applied voltages are 0 or 1\u00a0V of the phase modulators to present the logic 0 and 1, respectively. PMA and PMB are connected to the directional coupler DCA. After that, the output signals of DCA are launched into DCB and DCC. DCA, DCB and DCC serve as the input matrix Win of the 2-layer MLP in which the values of the elements are chosen randomly. The coupling ratio of DCA, DCB and DCC is therefore set randomly. In our research, for the example of the XOR gate, the coupling ratios of the DCA, DCB and DCC are set randomly to be 0.56, 0.83 and 0.96, respectively.\nThe four outputs of the DCB and DCC are connected to the optical amplifiers A1, A2, A3 and A4, individually. The optical gain of the amplifiers is given by Go/(1 + G0P/Psat) where G0, P, Psat are the small signal power gain, the power of the input light, and the saturation output power, respectively. For all amplifiers, the small signal power gain and the saturation output power are set to be 30\u00a0dB and 30dBm, respectively. The optical amplifiers provide the non-linear function which is required for 2-layer MLP system. The complex electric field of the output light of the amplifiers A1, A2, A3 and A4 are denoted by X1, X2, X3 and X4, respectively, which are regarded as the output of the neurons. Therefore, the number of the neurons, M in Eqs. (3) and (4) is 4. In other words, an optical amplifier can be regarded as an optical neuron. The readout\u00a0matrix Wout is composed of the 3 phase modulators PM1, PM2 and PM3 as well as the 3 directional couplers DC1, DC2 and DC3. \u22051 , \u22052 and \u22053 are the phase delay of the phase modulators PM1, PM2 and PM3, respectively. \u03b11 , \u03b12 and \u03b13 are the coupling ratios of the DC1, DC2 and DC3, respectively. The general formula of the output of electric field for the phase modulator and the directional coupler can be given by Eqs.\u00a0(6) and (7), respectively.\nwhere Xin and Xout represent the complex input and output electric fields of the components, respectively. \u2205 and \u03b1 are the phase delay of the phase modulators and the coupling ratio of the 2 by 2 DCs, respectively. The two input lights in the directional coupler are interfered. Using Eqs. (6) and (7), the complex electric field of the output light of the whole system Ytarget can be derived by\nThe first step of the design process is to define the gate. For example, for an XOR gate, the possible recombination of the input signals A and B are (0, 0), (0, 1\u00a0V), (1\u00a0V, 0) and (1\u00a0V, 1\u00a0V). Thus, in Eq.\u00a0(4), the number of the possible recombination of the input signals, N , is 4. The corresponding result Ytarget for the XOR gate are [0 1 1 0]. The complex electric fields X1, X2, X3 and X4 are located at the output of A1, A2, A3 and A4, respectively, as shown in Fig.\u00a01. For each recombination of the input signals, the complex values of X1, X2, X3 and X4 are collected to form the 4 by 4 matrix X of Eq.\u00a0(4). According to Eq.\u00a0(5), the values of w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 of the 1 by 4 matrix Wout can be obtained using Ytarget and X. The coefficients of the terms X1, X2, X3 and X4 in Eq.\u00a0(8) are equal to the 4 complex values w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 of Wout forming 4 simultaneous equations. The phases of the complex numbers w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 are denoted by \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 and \u03b84 . The boundary conditions for \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , are real numbers between 0 and 1. By solving the simultaneous equations, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u22051 , \u22052 and \u22053 can be obtained by\n(6)Xout = Xinei\u2205\n(7) [\nXout1 Xout2\n] = [\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1 i \u221a \u03b1\ni \u221a \u03b1 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\n][\nXin1 Xin2\n]\nYtarget = \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b13 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b11X1 + j \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b13 \u221a \u03b11e i(\u22051)X2\n(8)+j \u221a \u03b13 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b12ei(\u22053)X3 \u2212 \u221a \u03b13 \u221a \u03b12e i(\u22052+\u22053)X4\n(9)\u03b11 = 1\n1\u2212 [\nw1 w2 ei(\u22051)\n]2\n(10)\u03b12 = 1\n1\u2212 [\nw3 w4 e i(\u22052)\n]2\n(11)\u03b13 = (1\u2212 \u03b11)e2i(\u2212\u22052\u2212\u22053)\n(1\u2212 \u03b11)e2i(\u2212\u22052\u2212\u22053) + [\nw1 w4\n]2 \u03b12\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:14203 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18408-0"

            "text": "The Ytarget for the OR, AND, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR logic gates is [0 1 1 1], [0 0 0 1], [0 1 1 0], [1 1 1 0], [1 0 0 0] and [1 0 0 1], respectively. For each gate, the coupling ratios of the DCA, DCB and DCC in Fig.\u00a01, \u03b1A, \u03b1B and \u03b1C, are chosen randomly for 100 times to obtain the best tolerance. The detail calculation of tolerance will be discussed in the next section. The obtained \u03b1A, \u03b1B and \u03b1C for each gate are listed in Table\u00a01. The corresponding coupling ratio of the directional couplers DC1, DC2, DC3 and the phase delay of the phase modulators PM1, PM2, PM3 calculated through Eqs. (2)\u2013(14) are listed in Table\u00a02. The output powers of the OR, AND, XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR logic gates for different input signals A and B are shown in Fig.\u00a02. For the electro-optical logic gates, the relation between the input signals and the output of the 2-layer MLP system follows the truth table of the corresponding logic gates. The reconfigurable logic gate can be achieved by tuning the parameters of the directional couplers27\u201330 and phase modulators31 as listed in Tables\u00a01 and 2. It is worth mentioning that the phase delay of the phase modulators for NOR gate is close to null revealing that the phase modulators PM1, PM2 and PM3 might be removed. For the other gates, it is might be possible to find the solution to remove the phase modulators.\nWe use the visibility of the output signals of logic 0 and logic 1 to evaluate the tolerance of our logic gates. The definition of visibility is shown in Eq.\u00a0(15)32\nwhere I1min and I0max are the minimum light intensity of the high level (logic 1) and the maximum light intensity of the low level (logic 0), respectively. For example, for the output logic of XOR gate [0 1 1 0], if the output intensity of the 2-layer MLP system is [0.001, 0.013, 0.011, 0.002], we choose I1min and I0max as 0.011 and 0.002, respectively to calculate the visibility.\nSince the coupling ratio of the directional couplers DC1, DC2, DC3 and the phase delay of the phase modulators PM1, PM2, PM3 are solved using Eqs.\u00a0(2)\u2013(14), the light intensity of the low level (logic 0) is null. The corresponding visibility of the output signals for all logic gates is unity.\nDuring the fabrication of the directional couplers by optical fibers or by silicon waveguides, 1% error of the coupling ratio may happen. During the operation of the phase modulators by applying the voltage on the device, 1% error of the phase delay may occur. We calculate the visibility of the output signals as the coupling ratio of DC1, DC2, DC3 and the phase delay of the phase modulators PM1, PM2, PM3 are increased with 1% error.

For another example, for the XOR gate, as \u03d51 is increased from 8.88\u00b0 to 12.48\u00b0 (increasing 3.6\u00b0 = 1% from \u2013\u00a0\u03c0 to \u03c0), the visibility of the output signals is 0.91.

For 1% error of the phase delay of the phase modulators PM1, PM2 and PM3, the worst visibility is 0.83.

            "text": "In this work, we successfully establish an optical structure which can achieve EO logic gates. Thanks to this 2-layer-MLP structure, we can carry out the OR, AND, XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR logic gates. In other words, we could take advantage of one optical neural network to achieve the most basic logic gates in optical approach. According to Eq.\u00a0(5), we obtain the coupling ratio of the directional couplers DC1, DC2, and DC3 and the phase delay of the phase modulators PM1, PM2, PM3 under the ideal condition. The tolerance of the optical devices in our optical neural network is studied. The visibility changes of the output signals due to the 1% error during the fabrication and operation of the optical devices could be acceptable indicating that the reconfigurable optical logic gates can be realized in one optical configuration. Comparing our EO logic gates to the conventional electric logic gates, this EO logic gates have the capability of higher operating frequency, and high speed. In our study, the logic-gates functions among OR, AND, XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR can be designed when the PMs and the coupling ratio of DCs are tuned in this EO logic gates. Thus, the control process is simpler. The present design uses the neural networks without recurrent property. The calculation performance could be faster than that of the previous work5. The optical logic gates can be applied to build an optical memory using the latch structure to store the information."
