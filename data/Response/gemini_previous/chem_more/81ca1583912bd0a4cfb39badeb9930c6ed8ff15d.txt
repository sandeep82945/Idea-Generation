1. **Investigate the long-term effects of digestate storage on soil health and crop productivity.** This could involve field trials to compare the effects of digestate stored under different conditions on soil properties, crop yields, and nutrient uptake.
2. **Develop new methods for storing digestate to minimize nutrient loss and environmental impact.** This could involve exploring the use of different storage materials, such as biochar or zeolites, or developing new technologies for anaerobic digestion that produce a more stable digestate.
3. **Identify the specific bioactive compounds in digestate that are responsible for its antioxidant and antifungal properties.** This could involve using metabolomics and other analytical techniques to isolate and characterize these compounds.
4. **Develop new products from digestate that utilize its bioactive compounds.** This could involve developing new fertilizers, soil amendments, or other products that can improve plant health and productivity.
5. **Investigate the potential of digestate as a source of renewable energy.** This could involve exploring the use of digestate to produce biogas or other forms of renewable energy.
