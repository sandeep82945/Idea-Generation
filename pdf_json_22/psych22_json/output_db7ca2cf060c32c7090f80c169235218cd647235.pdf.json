            "text": "The brain interprets sensory inputs to guide behavior, but behavior disrupts sensory inputs. In primates, saccadic eye movements displace visual images on the retina and yet the brain perceives visual stability, a process called active vision. We studied whether active vision is Bayesian. Humans and monkeys reported whether an image moved during saccades. We tested whether they used prior expectations to account for sensory uncertainty in a Bayesian manner. For continuous judgments, subjects were Bayesian. For categorical judgments, they were anti-Bayesian for uncertainty due to external, image noise but Bayesian for uncertainty due to internal, motor-driven noise. A discriminative learning model explained the anti-Bayesian effect. Therefore, active vision uses both Bayesian and discriminative models depending on task requirements (continuous vs. categorical) and the source of uncertainty (image noise vs. motor-driven noise), suggesting that active perceptual mechanisms are governed by the interaction of both models.\nKeywords: vision, saccades, perception, active perception, Bayesian models, priors, discriminative models, primates, corollary discharge."

            "text": "The process of generating percepts from external stimuli can be split into two stages. A stimulus is first detected by sensory receptors and encoded into neural signals1. Receptors provide evidence, E, for the stimulus, S, to the rest of the system. The evidence is then decoded to infer the stimulus from the evidence2,3. Under a probabilistic framework, the goal of decoding is to infer the probability of the stimulus given the evidence, P(S|E)4.\nModels of decoding take two broad forms5. Discriminative models directly estimate\nP(S|E) by finding boundaries between evidence states and mapping stimulus states onto\n2\u00a0 \u00a0\nthem6,7. Generative models, in contrast, build internal models of the world8,9,10. These include the joint probability of the stimulus and the evidence co-occurring, P(E, S). P(S|E) can be derived from the joint probability using Bayes\u2019 rule. As such, Bayesian models are an implementation of generative models. Discriminative and Bayesian models have distinct strengths and are thought to combine for perception11,12,13. For example, discriminative models are flexible but vulnerable to sensory uncertainty. Bayesian models, on the other hand, use prior knowledge to optimally resolve uncertainty, e.g., due to environmental or receptor noise. Due to their robustness to noise, Bayesian models have been influential in explaining behavior across a wide range of sensorimotor stimulus estimation tasks14-22.\nSensory uncertainty may be introduced at the input stage or arise incidentally from one\u2019s\nown movements. Constructing a stable, predictable percept of the world while moving through it constitutes active perception23,24. Active perception is fundamental for everyday behavior and its dysfunction may contribute to hallucinations and delusions25,26,27. Our overall goal was to test whether active perception, like many other systems, is explained by Bayesian models.\nVision across saccades is an apt model system for studying active perception28,29. Each\nsaccade blurs and displaces the visual image on the retinas. To counter these disruptions, the visual system uses a copy of the saccade command, or \u201ccorollary discharge\u201d to suppress the blur and nullify the displacements30. Previous work suggested that at least part of this process, saccadic suppression of the blur, is the outcome of combining motor and sensory information across saccades in a Bayes optimal manner31,32.\nHere, we focus on whether Bayesian models are used to correct self-generated retinal\nshifts. The visual system, using corollary discharge, can remap its processing to predict its inputs after each saccade 33,34,35 and then compare that prediction with the postsaccadic visual input (Figure 1a). A match means that a viewed object was stable. Previous work by Rao et al.36 showed that humans use priors about the probability that an object will move for this process.\n3\u00a0 \u00a0\nThey did not vary sensory uncertainty, however. Here we tested the hypothesis that the process of achieving perceptual stability across saccades is Bayesian. The key prediction is that priors about object movement are used more when sensory input is less certain."

Human participants fixated near the center of a screen, and upon being cued, made a saccade to a target. During the saccade, the target was displaced by varying amounts. After the saccade, participants reported their perception of whether the target had moved or not. The target always moved, but the displacement was drawn from two different distributions. On \u201cjump trials,\u201d it was drawn from a broad Gaussian distribution (\u03bc=0\u00b0, \u03c3=1.5\u00b0), and on \u201cnon-jump\u201d trials it was drawn from a very narrow Gaussian distribution (\u03bc=0\u00b0, \u03c3=0.017\u00b0) (Figure S1). Since the distributions overlapped, there was no objectively correct solution to the task. The optimal solution would be to learn the relative probabilities of jump and non-jump trials. Information about the probability of jump trials was the \u201cprior\u201d for this task. To train priors or cue learned priors, we used the color of the fixation cross (Figure 1b, top dashed box), similar to the method of Rao et al.36\n4\u00a0 \u00a0\nIn Experiment 1 (n=9 participants), we first identified a stimulus manipulation that reliably\ninduced sensory uncertainty (Figure 1b, lower dashed box). We tested four potential manipulations at two noise levels each and found that sensory uncertainty was most reliably induced by increasing the standard deviation of an isoluminant Gaussian \u201cblob\u201d target (Figure\n5\u00a0 \u00a0\n1c,d). This yielded psychometric functions (fit to pooled data across participants; individual curves in Figure S2) that were steeper in the lower-noise condition (Figure 1c, black curve, \u03c3t=0.19\u00ba) than in the high-noise condition (Figure 1c, red curve, \u03c3t=0.47\u00ba). There were significant differences in d\u2019 (ref. 38) between the low (mean=2.08, SE=0.15) and high (mean=1.62, SE=0.14) noise levels (p=0.0023; paired t-tests; \u03b1=0.0125 to correct for four comparisons) (Figure 1d). Figure S3 shows results for the other stimuli.\nIn Experiment 2, participants were trained on priors, \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d), using performance-based feedback. They first completed a baseline block of 100 trials in which the fixation cross was white and \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d) = 0.5. Two \u201cprior blocks\u201d of 600 trials, subdivided into training and testing trials, followed. Prior training trials constituted 70% of trials in the block (Figure 1e). The fixation color indicated \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d) (= 0.1 or 0.9) and the target had the lowest uncertainty (\u03c3t=0.1\u00ba), essentially punctate. The remaining 30% of trials were \u201chypothesis testing\u201d trials (Figure 1c). The color of the fixation cross indicated the prior, but the true jump probability was a neutral 0.5 to isolate the effects of the learned, color-cued priors. Targets in these trials had additional sensory uncertainty (\u201cmedium\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d) corresponding to wider Gaussians (\u03c3t=0.25\u00ba and 0.5\u00ba, respectively). The hypothesis testing trials were relatively infrequent and interspersed randomly to mitigate the possibility of participants recognizing that higher noise targets implied a neutral prior. We also performed a control experiment in which the jump probability matched the priors across noise conditions (results in Figure 3).\n6\u00a0 \u00a0\nTo analyze data from Experiment 2, we compared participants\u2019 performance with the\npredictions of a Bayesian ideal observer model (Figure 2a-c; details under Detailed Methods: Section 4). On every trial, the ideal observer decided whether the probe jumped or not given a\n7\u00a0 \u00a0\nperceived displacement, \ud835\udc65. The decision would be \u201cyes\u201d if the probability of a jump given \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d| \ud835\udc65), exceeded the probability of non-jump given \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc43(\u00ac\ud835\udc3d| \ud835\udc65): \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d| \ud835\udc65) > \ud835\udc43(\u00ac\ud835\udc3d| \ud835\udc65) 1 The decision variable \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc65)=1 (jumped) if the condition in braces is met. Otherwise, \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc65)=0 (no jump). Using Bayes\u2019 rule,\n\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65|\ud835\udc3d)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d) > \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc65|\u00ac\ud835\udc3d) 1 - \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc3d) 2 where \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65|\ud835\udc3d) and \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc65|\u00ac\ud835\udc3d) are the likelihoods of \u201cjump\u201d and \u201cno jump,\u201d respectively. For\neach prior, \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d), there was a threshold at which the condition in braces was met, i.e., it was equally likely that the probe jumped or did not. For \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.5, it was where the two likelihood distributions intersected and were equal (Figure 2a, black vertical line). If there was no sensory uncertainty, i.e., if \ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc65 where \ud835\udc65 was the true displacement, the ideal observer would report \u201cno jump\u201d for all displacements less than the threshold and \u201cjump\u201d for all displacements above the threshold. Since the target was a Gaussian blob, we assume Gaussian uncertainty \ud835\udf0et, determined by the target, about the true displacement, \ud835\udc65 (Figure 2a, black distribution): \ud835\udc65 ~ \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc65,\ud835\udf0e 3 Therefore, the decision given the true displacement, \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc65 , was the integral over values of \ud835\udc65 greater than the decision threshold (Figure 2a, shaded region):\n\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65|\ud835\udc3d) \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65| \ud835\udc3d) \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc3d 1 \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc65| \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 4\nThis restricted the value of the decision to range from 0 to 1. We first assessed prior learning. For a high prior, e.g., \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.9, the threshold would move to the left since \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65|\ud835\udc3d) was weighted higher than \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc65|\u00ac\ud835\udc3d), thus increasing the ratio in the braces (Figure 2b), and vice versa for a lower prior, e.g. \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.1 (Figure 2c). Critically, for the same perceived displacement, the ideal observer was more likely to report that the probe jumped for a higher prior than for a lower prior. Figure 2d shows simulations for an ideal observer with likelihood distributions, \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65|\ud835\udc3d) ~ \ud835\udc41 0, 2 and \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65|\u00ac\ud835\udc3d) ~ \ud835\udc41 0, 0.017 , prior \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.22\n8\u00a0 \u00a0\n(teal), \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.5 (black), and \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.78 (orange), and sensory noise, \ud835\udc65 ~ N \ud835\udc65, 0.1). We chose \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.22 and 0.78 for the simulations to account for 70% true-statistic trials and 30% neutral. The key point was that the high prior was >0.5 and the low prior was <0.5. Figure 2e shows the value of the curves at displacement = 0 (the intercept).\nFor the human participants (n=17, Figure 2f), in the prior training trials, psychometric\ncurves shifted upward for the high prior (orange curve) and downward for the low prior (teal curve) at small displacements as predicted. The crossing of the low-prior (teal) curve over the black was not predicted but has implications that are addressed later (Figure. 8 and its associated text). Data for individual participants are shown in Figure S4. A lower intercept in the low prior condition than in the high prior condition (Figure 2g) matched the Bayesian predictions in Figure 2e. Repeated-measures ANOVA on the intercepts with prior as the within-conditions factor yielded a significant main effect of priors (F(2)=11.82; p=0.0001). Post-hoc comparison (Tukey HSD) of the \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.9 and 0.1 conditions, the two priors tested later in hypothesis testing trials, showed that high-prior intercepts (mean=0.26, SE=0.04) were significantly higher than low-prior intercepts (mean=0.08, SE=0.01; p=2.79x10-4). These results indicated that participants learned the priors as expected.\n9\u00a0 \u00a0\n10\u00a0 \u00a0\nIn the randomized, less frequent hypothesis testing trials, we tested the Bayesian\nhypothesis that priors are used more with increasing uncertainty. In these trials, the targets had medium or high sensory uncertainty. Figures 3a,b show Bayesian predictions for these mediumand high-noise conditions, respectively. We used the same likelihood ratios and priors as in Figure 2a-c, but with sensory noise \ud835\udc65 ~ N \ud835\udc65, 0.25) and \ud835\udc65 ~ N \ud835\udc65, 0.5), respectively, to match the medium and high noise target widths. The model predicted greater separation between the low(teal) and high-prior (orange) decision curves, i.e., greater prior use, in the high noise condition than in the medium noise condition, quantified by the high prior - low prior intercept difference (Figure 3c). In other words, the Bayesian ideal observer used the prior more with increasing sensory noise.\nHuman participants showed the opposite effect: they used their priors less with\nincreasing noise. Psychometric curves across priors moved closer together in the high-noise (\u03c3=0.5\u00ba) condition (Figure 3e) compared to the medium-noise (\u03c3=0.25\u00ba) condition (Figure 3d). Data for individuals shown in Figures S5 and S6. The difference in intercepts was significantly greater in the medium-noise condition (mean=0.17, SE=0.04) than in the high-noise condition (mean=0.06, SE=0.03; p=0.0081 using a paired t-test) (Figure 3f). Overall, the results in Experiment 2 suggested that, in this sense, human participants were anti-Bayesian.\nWe considered the possibility that participants were not anti-Bayesian but had learned\nthat trials with medium- and high-noise targets had a neutral jump probability. In this case, their prior for the hypothesis testing trials would be 0.5 and the Bayesian prediction is for the orange and teal psychometric curves to collapse together with increasing noise. Note that if the participants only learned the priors according to target type (i.e., low noise targets = color-cued prior, but medium and high noise targets = 0.5), then there would be no separation between the orange and teal psychometric curves at all. Therefore, participants clearly learned the colorassociated priors. Nevertheless, to account for this potential confound, we analyzed results from a control experiment in two rhesus macaques in which the jump probability matched the color-\n11\u00a0 \u00a0\nassociated prior for all noise levels. A full description of the monkey experiments is provided in Detailed Methods: Section 2. Briefly, all seven trial types (3 priors with low sensory noise + 2 each with medium and high noise) were randomly interleaved and had the same relative frequencies (Figure 3g). Consistent with the human results, the intercept differences between the \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.8 and 0.2 conditions decreased with increasing sensory noise (3h-i) for both monkeys. Repeated-measures ANOVA on intercept differences with noise levels as the main within-subjects factor yielded significant effects (Monkey S: F(2)=51.75, p=4.97x10-15; Monkey T: F(2)=4.56, p=0.0176). For monkey S (n=40 sessions), post-hoc comparisons (Tukey HSD) showed that intercept differences in the low noise condition (\u03c3t=0.5\u00b0; mean=0.82, SE=0.02) were significantly higher than in the medium noise (\u03c3t=1.25\u00b0; mean=0.60, SE=0.05; p=3.49x106) and high noise (\u03c3t=2\u00b0; mean=0.40, SE=0.05; p=0) conditions. Intercept differences in the medium noise condition were also higher than in the high noise condition (p=1.51x10-5). For Monkey T (n=18 sessions), there was a significant difference between the low (\u03c3t=0.5\u00b0; mean=0.52, SE=0.06) and high noise (\u03c3t=1.75\u00b0; mean=0.36, SE=0.05; p=0.0190) conditions. Intercept differences in the medium noise condition (\u03c3t=1.25\u00b0; mean=0.39, SE=0.06) fell between the low and high noise conditions, not significantly different from either. Overall, the results replicated our human findings to confirm that the anti-Bayesian effect was based on learned, color-associated priors.\nContinuous judgments of displacement are Bayesian Do the above results mean that the perception of visual displacement across saccades is always anti-Bayesian? Or was that outcome due, at least in part, to the categorical (binary) nature of the task? We tested this in Experiment 3 by requiring continuous estimates of displacement across saccades31. Human participants performed the same SSD task, but instead of providing a binary report of \u201cjumped\u201d or \u201cdid not jump,\u201d they provided a continuous report using a mouse cursor (Figure 4a). The target jumps were horizontal, and the mouse\n12\u00a0 \u00a0\ncursor was restricted to that dimension. Formulating the task as a unidimensional, continuous problem allowed us to cast it in a form that has been tested across many sensorimotor domains14,15,18,21,22. If the uncertainty about the stimulus is modeled as the sensory likelihood, then the mean of the posterior (its maximum value and thus, our approximation of the inferred response) would be a reliability-weighted combination of the sensory likelihood and prior distributions (Figure 4b):\n\ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udf0e 6\nAs \u03c32likelihood increases, with the other terms held constant, \u03bcposterior approaches \u03bcprior. In other words, for a given prior with fixed uncertainty, the response should get closer to the prior with greater sensory uncertainty.\n13\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe prior was a Gaussian statistical distribution with \u03bcprior=0\u00b0 and \u03c3prior=1\u00b0. Participants\nwere first trained on the prior for 600 trials using performance-based feedback. They then performed 400 hypothesis testing trials that provided no feedback. There were four sensory uncertainty conditions: low noise (\u03c3t=0.1\u00b0), medium noise (\u03c3t=0.5\u00b0), high noise (\u03c3t=1\u00b0), and an \u201cinfinite noise\u201d condition in which the target did not reappear postsaccadically. Figure 4c\n14\u00a0 \u00a0\nillustrates the distributions used in the experiment, with the prior centered at 0\u00b0 and the likelihood (Gaussian blob) distributions centered, for purpose of illustration, on displacement = 1\u00b0.\nFigure 4d shows the predicted deviation in response from the presented displacement\n(displacement - response) for a Bayesian ideal observer (details in Detailed Methods: Continuous Bayesian simulations). If the sensory uncertainty is much smaller than that of the prior, as in the lowest noise condition (black line), then the deviation of the posterior (response) from the true displacement should be near 0 for all presented displacements. Conversely, for maximal sensory uncertainty as in the infinite noise condition (orange line), the response should always be the mean of the prior. Since \u03bcprior=0\u00b0, the deviation for each displacement equals the displacement itself. The medium (teal) and high (purple) noise conditions are predicted to fall in between the low and infinite noise conditions, with slopes proportional to noise level. In summary, the slope of the deviation line increases with increasing sensory uncertainty.\nParticipants\u2019 (n=11) responses in the hypothesis testing trials matched Bayesian\npredictions (Figure 4e). The slopes of the deviation lines increased with increasing sensory uncertainty (Figure 4f). Repeated-measures ANOVA on the slopes yielded a significant main effect of noise level (F(3)=78.01, p=2.87x10-11). Post-hoc comparison of conditions (Tukey HSD) showed that slopes in the low-noise (\u03c3t=0.1\u00b0) condition (mean=0.21, SE=0.04) were significantly lower than in the high-noise (\u03c3t=1\u00b0; mean=0.44, SE=0.07, p=0.0011) and infinite noise conditions (mean=0.96, SE=0.02; p=6.98x10-14). Also, slopes in the medium noise condition (\u03c3t=0.5\u00b0, mean=0.30, SE=0.04) were significantly lower than in the infinite noise condition (p=2.05x10-12), and slopes in the high-noise condition were significantly lower than in the infinite-noise condition (p=4.65x10-10).\nWe fit individual participant responses to a Bayesian ideal observer model by minimizing\nsquared error to infer their used prior and sensory likelihood distributions (Figure 4g). The prior mean and standard deviation, and standard deviations of the low-, medium- and high-noise\n15\u00a0 \u00a0\nparameters, were fit simultaneously by assuming that the response in the infinite noise condition was the prior mean. Model outputs for the prior mean (mean=0.05, SE=0.04) were not significantly different from 0, the true prior (p=0.22, one-sample t-test). Fit parameters for likelihood standard deviations increased with increasing noise, with repeated-measures ANOVA yielding a main factor of noise level (F(2)=16.72, p=0.0003) (Figure 4h). Post-hoc comparisons (Tukey HSD) showed that the standard deviation in the low noise condition (mean=2.12, SE=0.62) was significantly lower than in the medium (mean=3.01, SE=0.77; p=0.0062) and high noise (mean=3.53, SE=0.83; p=3.71x10-5) conditions.\nFinally, we assessed the correlation between slopes of lines fit to model-generated\nresponses (i.e., using model-fit means and SDs) and participants\u2019 responses (Figure 4i). The correlation was strong and highly significant (r=0.97, p=1.48x10-20), suggesting that the fit parameters explained the data on a participant-by-participant basis. Overall, the results in Experiment 3 showed that participants\u2019 responses systematically moved closer to the prior with increasing sensory noise (4e-f) and that a Bayesian ideal-observer model largely explained the results (4g-i).\nAnti-Bayesian categorization is driven by image noise but not motor-driven noise The above results showed that continuous perception across saccades is Bayesian, but categorical perception is anti-Bayesian. What gives rise to this puzzling dichotomy? Since behavior in other categorical tasks often is Bayesian39-43, our findings are likely more related to the perceptual system we studied than the task structure. In the visual system, object location is signaled via the organization of spatial receptive fields. Receptive fields are continuous from the retina to higher order visual areas44-47 and maintain their retinotopic properties even across eye movements48,49 and when remapped50,51,52. Moreover, neurons in the frontal eye field use continuous tuning to represent object displacements across saccades53, the stimulus quantity we probed directly. Thus, the intrinsic organization for processing visual location across\n16\u00a0 \u00a0\nsaccades is in continuous coordinates. If reports of displacement are required in similarly continuous coordinates, the visual system is perhaps well-equipped to use a Bayes optimal strategy. Requiring a categorical report of the continuous system might necessitate an alternative strategy. This explanation has two important implications.\nFirst, it implies that anti-Bayesian prior use was driven primarily by the organization of\nthe visual system. A potential counterargument is that the Gaussian blob in Experiments 2 and 3 was both the visual object and the saccade target. Blurring it might have added noise to the saccade and consequently the motor prediction (Figure 1a, black arrow), which depends on a copy of the saccade command, in addition to adding noise to the visual input (Figure 1a, red arrow). We did not find evidence of this, however. As a function of Gaussian blur, the standard deviations of saccadic endpoints54,55 did not change either parallel or perpendicular to the saccade in either the categorical (Experiment 2; Figure 5a,b) or the continuous (Experiment 3; Figure 5c,d) experiment for humans (Repeated-measures ANOVAs: F(2)=0.32, p=0.7306 in Experiment 2 and F(3)=1.55, p=0.2230 in Experiment 3 for endpoints parallel to the saccade; F(2)=0.14, p=0.8693 in Experiment 2 and F(3)=2.6, p=0.1129 in Experiment 3 for endpoints perpendicular to the saccade). Therefore, uncertainty in the visual input seems to have been the sole factor driving the anti-Bayesian prior use.\nSecond, the explanation that Bayesian prior use occurs in continuous report tasks for the\ncontinuously-organized visual system implies the converse: Bayesian prior use should occur in categorical report tasks for systems having categorical properties. Making a saccade is one example. Each saccade poses an inherent, largely categorical sensory uncertainty in the form of saccadic suppression30,37,56-60. Visual processing is suppressed when a saccade is made, and not otherwise. This predicts that prior use would be Bayesian to compensate for saccadic suppression.\n17\u00a0 \u00a0\nThese considerations suggest a hypothesis that categorical tasks elicit (1) anti-Bayesian\nprior use if the sensory uncertainty is continuous (here, because it is represented in the continuously organized visual system), but (2) Bayesian prior use if the sensory uncertainty is categorical (here, because it is due to a saccade being made or not). In Experiments 4 and 5, respectively, we tested these hypotheses. We controlled for motor prediction uncertainty covarying with visual uncertainty by separating the blurred visual stimulus from the saccade target. The experiments used monkeys to permit precise eye position measurements with implanted scleral search coils61,62.\nIn Experiment 4 (Figure 5e), we selectively manipulated visual uncertainty by varying the\nwidth of the Gaussian blob (i.e., the image noise). The structure of Experiment 4 was nearly identical to Experiment 2 in humans (Figure 5e, right): there were three noise levels (low, medium, and high). Low-noise, prior-training trials comprised 70% of all trials, while mediumand high-noise hypothesis-testing trials with neutral jump probability of 0.5 comprised 30% of trials. All trial types were randomly interleaved. In Experiment 5 (Figure 5f), there were two levels of motor-driven uncertainty. In the \u201chigh uncertainty\u201d condition, monkeys made a saccade to a target (to induce saccadic suppression) and reported whether a probe moved or not. In the \u201clow uncertainty\u201d condition, they withheld the saccade (no saccadic suppression) while the probe moved. With- and no-saccade trials at three prior levels each were randomly interleaved (Figure 5f, right).\n18\u00a0 \u00a0\nResults from Experiment 4 replicated the results from Experiment 2: the behavior was\nanti-Bayesian (Figure 6). As expected from separating the visual probe from the saccade target, there were no significant changes in standard deviations of saccade endpoints across noise levels (Figure S7). Hence prior use was driven by visual uncertainty with no detectable\n19\u00a0 \u00a0\ncontribution of motor prediction uncertainty. Both animals learned the priors as expected (\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.2, 0.5, or 0.8), leading to an upward shift in psychometric functions for the high (\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.8) prior and a downward shift for the low (\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3d)=0.2) prior (Figure 6a,b). Quantitatively, intercepts [95% confidence intervals] increased with increasing priors: 0.08 [0.07, 0.10], 0.36 [0.33, 0.39] and 0.57 [0.53, 0.60] for Monkey S (Figure 6c, circles) and 0.18 [0.15, 0.22], 0.33 [0.30, 0.36] and 0.40 [0.31, 0.45] for Monkey T (Figure 6c, triangles).\n20\u00a0 \u00a0\n21\u00a0 \u00a0\nAlso consistent with human participants, prior use decreased with increasing noise\n(Figure 6d-i). Psychometric functions for the 0.2 and 0.8 prior conditions got closer to each other with increasing noise for both Monkey S (Figure 6d,e) and Monkey T (Figure 6g,h), in contrast to the greater separation with noise predicted by a Bayesian model (Figure 3a,b). Intercept differences between the high- and low-prior conditions reflected this collapsing of curves. Monkey S had an intercept difference of 0.25 [0.18, 0.32] in the medium noise condition and 0.03 [-0.03, 0.09] in the high noise condition. For Monkey T, it was 0.12 [0.05, 0.19] for medium noise and 0.01 [-0.05, 0.08] for high noise. Overall, the results showed that both monkeys used their priors less with increasing image noise. Note that the control experiment presented in Figure 3 also selectively varied the width of the Gaussian blob but not the saccade target, replicating the finding that prior use with increasing external, image uncertainty was antiBayesian regardless of task structure.\nExperiment 5 showed, in contrast, that prior use to account for motor-related noise in the\ncategorical task was Bayesian (Figure 7). Since early visual processing and sensitivity to displacements are suppressed around the time of saccades, we simulated motor-driven noise by increasing the standard deviation of the non-jump likelihood distribution in the with-saccade condition relative to the no-saccade condition (\u03c3NJ=1\u00b0 and 0.25\u00b0, respectively) while holding the standard deviation of the jump likelihood distribution constant (\u03c3J=5\u00b0). That is, larger displacements are perceived as \u201cnon-jumps\u201d in the with-saccade condition to mimic the saccadic suppression of displacement.\n22\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe Bayesian model predicts that psychometric functions in the 0.2 and 0.8 prior\nconditions would separate further (Figure 7a,b) and that the difference in intercepts between them would be greater (Figure 7c) with greater motor-driven noise. Results from both monkeys\n23\u00a0 \u00a0\nmatched these model predictions. Psychometric curves for the different priors showed greater separation when animals made a saccade (Figure 7e: Monkey S; Figure 7h: Monkey T; n=6000 analyzed trials for both animals) than in the condition without a saccade (Figure 7d: Monkey S; Figure 7g: Monkey T). The intercept difference between priors was 0.07 [0.04, 0.10] in the nosaccade condition and 0.41 [0.36, 0.46] when a saccade was made for Monkey S (Figure 7f), and 0.03 [-0.0007, 0.06] and 0.37 [0.30, 0.42] respectively for Monkey T (Figure 7i)."

            "text": "In sum, categorical judgments were Bayesian for motor-driven noise but anti-Bayesian for image noise. This leads to the question of how the anti-Bayesian behavior is generated. To address this, we sought to explain two aspects of the results that violated Bayesian predictions. First, prior use decreased with increasing image noise. Second, for human participants, the low prior (teal) curve rose above the baseline (black) curve in Figure 2e, violating the Bayesian prediction of parallel prior psychometric curves (Figure 2d). Although prior curves were parallel for monkeys (Figure 6b,c and Figure 7e,h, respectively), this was after extensive training. Humans performed only single sessions. The early prior-training data from both monkeys were consistent with the human data (Figure 8a,b, teal curves rose above black curves). Therefore, an alternative model would have to explain the disproportionately high \u201cjump\u201d response rate for low priors early in training in addition to the decrease in prior use with increasing visual uncertainty.\n24\u00a0 \u00a0\n25\u00a0 \u00a0\nAn alternative framework to Bayesian models is discriminative models4-7, which directly\nlearn to classify stimuli. For our categorical task, a discriminative model would seek to classify continuous displacements into two categories, \u201cjump\u201d and \u201cno jump.\u201d We set up a simple twolayer neural network to classify displacements (Figure 8c) and simulated its performance under experimental conditions (Figure 8e-j). For details, see Detailed Methods: Section 4. To summarize its design, the neural network received continuous displacements in its input layer that were mapped onto \u201cjump\u201d and \u201cno jump\u201d as output categories. The final output was normalized to range from 0-1 to produce a \u201cprobability of reporting jumped\u201d given a perceived displacement. The activation of the input layer was determined by the sensory noise on each trial, and there were separate input layers for each prior such that the input-output mapping was prior-dependent. The weights between inputs and outputs were updated in an error-driven manner, rather than a purely associative one63, based on work by Gluck and Bower (1988)64 who showed that error-driven learning leads to a disproportionate overweighting of infrequent events. This is equivalent to the Perceptron learning rule65,66. Since errors are large early in training, weight changes are relatively large, too (left side of Figure 8c, inset; red dashed arrows depict the error). Over time, as the errors decrease, the weights asymptote towards the desired state (right side of Figure 8c, inset). For infrequent events such as large displacements in the low prior condition early in training, weight changes are relatively large. Taking a snapshot of performance at this stage results in an apparent overweighting of their contribution to the response rate (Figures 2e and 8a,b). Once weights approach the desired state late in training, events contribute proportional to their relative frequencies, and the psychometric curves become more parallel to one another (Figures 6b,c and 7e,h).\nconditions. i-j) Late training data for (i) the combined model and (j) the discriminative model alone.\n26\u00a0 \u00a0\nWe simulated model performance under experimental conditions. First, we looked at\nearly prior learning. We simulated early learning using the same task structure and closelymatched parameters as Experiment 2. As expected, the outputs recapitulated the disproportionately high response rate for large displacements in the low prior condition (Figure S4b, teal curve). However, it also downweighted the infrequent small displacements in the high prior condition (Figure S8b, orange curve). To account for this, we considered that reports in the categorical task result from a combination of a discriminative (Figure 8c) and a Bayesian (Figure 8d) model. The Bayesian prior use for high saccade-driven uncertainty raises high prior intercepts (Figure 7e,h) and thus could compensate for the downweighting. Therefore, we next simulated a linearly weighted combination of outputs from the discriminative and Bayesian models in the prior training condition (Figure 8c,d, bottom; see Detailed Methods for details). Combining the outputs of the Bayesian and discriminative models at relative weights of 0.1 and 0.9 respectively generated the data in Figure 8e, where the pattern of the curves matched data from human participants well. Next, adding medium and high noise to the visual input of the discriminative model (but holding visual noise constant in the Bayesian model) caused psychometric curves to move closer to each other with increasing noise (Figure 8f,g), as quantified by the downward trend in high-low prior intercept differences (Figure 8h). Confirmation that visual uncertainty alone flattened psychometric curves in Figure S8b. Finally, we tested the prediction that prior curves become parallel once weights approach a relatively stable desired state for all input units (Figure 8c, inset, right) by letting the model run for 5000 trials. Data from trials 3000-5000 for the combined (discriminative + Bayesian) model (Figure 8i) and for the discriminative model alone (Figure 8j) support this prediction.\nIn summary, the combined model recapitulated both the surprising trade-off between\npriors and noise and the long-term learning effects that were unexplained by a Bayesian ideal\n27\u00a0 \u00a0\nobserver model alone. This demonstrated that a discriminative learning rule provides a feasible explanation for the anti-Bayesian categorization of object displacement across saccades."

            "text": "We found that human participants were Bayesian for continuous reports of object displacement across saccades but anti-Bayesian for categorical reports. Further investigation in monkeys showed that the anti-Bayesian effect was primarily due to external, image noise rather than motor-driven noise. The use of a Perceptron-like, discriminative learning rule provides a candidate explanation for anti-Bayesian performance in the categorization task.\nLimitations of the experimental design and modeling choices should be considered while\ninterpreting the results. First, it is possible that the anti-Bayesian result is a consequence of how we conceptualized parameters (e.g., the prior, or sensory noise) in the categorical Bayesian ideal observer model. For example, for continuous tasks, it has been shown that if the sensory likelihood is asymmetric in a way that can result from assumptions of efficient sensory encoding, then the outcome of a Bayesian decoding process can be seemingly anti-Bayesian67. Of course, alternative parameters might predict the surprising results. However, we chose simulation parameters to closely map onto experimental parameters and mimic empirical phenomena such as saccadic suppression. As a result, the model captures both the Bayesian trade-off with motor-driven noise and the anti-Bayesian trade-off with visual noise. To our best estimate, there was no simple set of alternative parameters that did so parsimoniously.\nSecond, we limited the simulation of motor-induced noise in Experiment 5 to just one\nphenomenon, i.e., saccadic suppression. We did this by increasing the width of the non-jump likelihood, \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc65|\u00ac\ud835\udc3d). We focused on saccadic suppression since it is largely a categorical form of uncertainty that is present when a saccade is made, and not otherwise. It was thus sufficient for testing our hypothesis. However, there are other ways in which saccades influence vision both at the level of behavior and neurons. Such effects include compression of space toward the\n28\u00a0 \u00a0\nsaccade target68-71 or the shifting or smearing of visual receptive fields around the time of saccades51,52. Indeed, the magnitude of saccadic suppression may vary with saccade amplitude72 and the direction in which the probe moves relative to the saccade vector31,53. Our results do not preclude the inclusion of additional, fine-grained motor-induced phenomena into the normative model, and the resulting predictions would be testable. Another consideration for Experiment 5 is that in the no-saccade condition of the task, animals fixated a central square for the duration of a trial. We did not prevent the animal from making fixational eye movements such as microsaccades73, and saccadic suppression may occur around the time of microsaccades74-77. Although we did not control for microsaccades, the stimulus displacement was not timed to microsaccade onset in no-saccade trials as it was to saccade onset in withsaccade trials. On average, therefore, the influence of (micro)saccadic suppression should be quite low in the no-saccade condition.\nFinally, we limited the scope of the discriminative and combined models to provide a\ncandidate alternative to the categorical Bayesian model with minimal additional assumptions. This leaves some unexplained patterns in the data, e.g., overall intercepts across priors decrease with increasing noise for humans (Figure. 3d,e) and monkeys (Figure 6d,e,g,h) but not for the model (Figure 8e-g). Similarly, for our experimental-like parameters, the model does not capture the complete collapse of prior curves with increasing noise. The model may be extended, however, to include additional components such as Bayesian integration in the continuous input layer (from Experiment 3) to better explain the data. Assumptions about how the components combine may additionally be testable too.\nThe overall pattern of results in our study poses a fundamental question: what\ndetermines the use of Bayesian vs. discriminative models for perception? Despite recent efforts to acknowledge the contribution of both Bayesian and non-Bayesian78,79 models to perception1113, the field lacks a synthesized, theoretical account of when Bayesian models are used and when they are not. As we noted while motivating Experiments 4 and 5, our results suggest a link\n29\u00a0 \u00a0\nbetween the inherent neural organization of sensorimotor systems and Bayesian behavior. Further clarification of this link would allow our understanding of each to constrain and advance our understanding of the other.\nFinally, we expect that the conclusions of this study extend beyond the oculomotor\nsystem. Accounting for self-movement is an issue for almost all sensory modalities, and the integration of movement and sensory signals for active perception has been observed widely in the brain80-83. Understanding the relative contributions of Bayesian and discriminative computations to active vision may guide future studies on how expectations, self-movement, and external sensory information combine for more general forms of active perception."

            "text": "45 adult volunteers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the experiments. All procedures were explained verbally to participants beforehand and written, informed consent was obtained. Participants were paid $12/hr. and informed that participation was completely voluntary. All procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board.\nParticipants sat alone in a darkened room in front of a monitor with their head stabilized\nusing a chin- and forehead-rest. The monitor was positioned at 60cm from the center of the head. Experiments 1 and 2 were displayed on a CRT monitor (Accusync 120) at 120Hz. Experiment 3 was displayed on a Dell LCD monitor at 60Hz. The experiment was written in and\n40\u00a0 \u00a0\ndisplayed using Presentation (Neurobehavioral systems). Monocular eye position was recorded with an eye-tracking software developed by Matsuda et al. (2017)84.\nParticipants performed a modified Saccadic Suppression of Displacement task37. On\neach trial, a fixation cross first appeared near the center of the screen. Once participants had acquired and maintained fixation for 500ms, a saccade target appeared at one of two average positions relative to the center of the screen: 10\u02da or -10\u02da. A target at 10\u02da appeared in the right half of the screen while a target at -10 appeared in the left half of the screen. Additionally, on every trial, the position of the target and fixation cross were both jittered by -0.5 to 0.5 degrees relative to the average position to mitigate the confounding effects of adaptation to either a constant saccade amplitude or a constant distance between the target and the edge of the screen. The fixation cross then disappeared for 500ms, and an auditory cue was presented to signal to participants that they were allowed to make a saccade to the target. If fixation was broken before the auditory cue, the trial was aborted and a new one began immediately. Saccade initiation (defined as the time the eye left a window of 2 deg. relative to the fixation cross) triggered target displacement. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants provided a binary, categorical report on whether they had perceived the target as having moved or not. The target remained on the screen for 500ms after it was displaced, after which it was replaced by a response prompt screen (5 = moved, 0 = remained stationary). In these experiments, target displacement was drawn from overlapping Gaussian distributions designated as the \u201cmovement\u201d and \u201cnon-movement\u201d distributions (Figure S1). Displacements were drawn from overlapping, rather than distinct, distributions to ensure that the solution to the task was probabilistic. On trials where the target moved, the displacement was drawn from a relatively broad Gaussian distribution centered around 0 (\u03bc=0\u00b0, \u03c3=1.5\u00b0). On \u201cno movement\u201d trials, the displacement was drawn from a very narrow Gaussian distribution centered around 0 (\u03bc=0\u00b0, \u03c3=0.017\u00b0). A positive displacement meant that the target moved rightward, and a negative displacement meant it moved leftward.\n41\u00a0 \u00a0\nIn Experiment 3, they provided a continuous report of the target\u2019s postsaccadic location.\nFor this study, the target stayed visible for 100ms after displacement and was then replaced by a screen where the mouse cursor (shaped \u201c+\u201d) was placed at the center of the screen and restricted to the horizontal meridian. Participants could then move the mouse cursor to where they perceived the target as having landed.\nPreliminary Experiment for visual uncertainty manipulation\nThe goal of Experiment 2 was to test the use of prior expectations with increasing sensory noise. The main experimental variables were thus priors and sensory noise. We planned to cue priors (jump probability) by the color of the fixation cross and train participants on this association using performance-based feedback. We were confident that this prior manipulation would be successful since it was only a slight variation from previous work in the lab36. As a first step, therefore, we sought to confirm that our sensory noise manipulation reliably induced uncertainty. 9 human participants completed at least 100 trials each in 8 experimental conditions: 4 candidate stimuli at two uncertainty levels each. The probability of target movement across all stimulus conditions was 0.5.\nThe 4 possible stimuli were: 1) A Gaussian cloud of 20 white squares (0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0) where the uncertainty corresponded to the standard deviation of the cloud (low uncertainty = 0.0625\u00b0 and high uncertainty = 0.25\u00b0). 2) Arrows (1\u00b0 long with 0.5\u00b0 width) that either pointed in the direction of the jump (congruent) or in the opposite direction (incongruent). We predicted that incongruent jumps might induce greater uncertainty and decrease discriminability. 3) Squares (0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0) at two levels of contrast (low uncertainty = 0.784 and high uncertainty = 0.294).\n42\u00a0 \u00a0\n4) Gaussian \u201cblobs\u201d (isoluminant, Gaussian distributions of light) uncertainty corresponded to the standard deviation of the blob (low uncertainty = 0.19\u00b0 and high uncertainty = 0.47\u00b0).\nThe results of this experiment would determine how we manipulated the sensory uncertainty of the stimulus in all other experiments.\nExperiment 2: Trade-off between binary prior and sensory uncertainty in humans We trained participants on the prior, cued by the color of the fixation cross, using performancebased feedback. They were told whether their responses were correct or incorrect on each trial using an image of a smiling or frowning face, respectively. Based on the results from Experiment 1, we chose the isoluminant Gaussian blob as sensory uncertainty manipulation. The target was grayscale on every trial; only its width given by the standard deviation changed. The target had one of three possible standard deviations for the whole experiment \u2013 0.1 deg. (\u201clow noise\u201d), 0.25 deg. (\u201cmedium noise) or 0.5 deg. (\u201chigh noise\u201d).\nTwenty participants completed a total of 1300 trials each. Trials were presented in 100-\ntrial blocks. For all participants, the first block was a baseline block where the color of the fixation cross was white, and the target moved on 50% of the trials. In the next 6 blocks, the fixation cross was either green or red, and vice versa for last 6. Each of these fixation colors was associated with one of two probabilities of target movement (0.9 or 0.1). The order of the two prior conditions and color-probability associations were counterbalanced across participants. As in Experiment 1, displacements were drawn from a relatively broad Gaussian distribution (\u03bc=0\u00b0, \u03c3=1.5\u00b0) on \u201cmovement\u201d trials and from a narrow Gaussian distribution (\u03bc=0\u00b0, \u03c3=0.017\u00b0) on \u201cnon-movement\u201d trials to ensure that the solution to the task was probabilistic. Thus, the optimal solution to the task was to learn the probability that any given displacement was drawn from the \u201cmovement\u201d distribution relative to the \u201cnon-movement\u201d distribution. In conditions with a biased prior (0.9 or 0.1), the optimal solution would be to weight this relative\n43\u00a0 \u00a0\nprobability by the appropriate prior. In other words, the optimal solution to this task is the Bayesian solution.\nFor 70% of the trials in blocks 2-13, the target had the lowest noise (standard deviation\nof 0.1\u00b0) and the probability of target displacement conformed to the experimental prior, i.e. 0.9 or 0.1. These 70% of the trials were considered \u201ctraining trials\u201d where the intended prior was reinforced and maintained. The other 30% of trials were \u201ctesting trials\u201d, where we tested the hypothesis that participants would use their learned prior more when the evidence was relatively uncertain. On these trials, the target had either medium or high sensory noise. Additionally, both to isolate the effects of a learned, color-associated expectation on performance and to mitigate the possibility that our sensory manipulation affected participants\u2019 representation of the prior, the testing trials comprised a neutral condition where the target had a 0.5 probability of moving, but the fixation color cuing the prior was the same as the rest of the block. Training and testing trials were randomly interleaved. To preserve a sense of experiential continuity across the experiment, 5% of the targets in block 1 had a standard deviation of 0.25 deg. (\u201cmedium-noise\u201d) and the remaining 5% had a standard deviation of 0.5 deg. (\u201chigh-noise\u201d). Data from these trials are not analyzed.\nExperiment 3: Trade-off between continuous prior and sensory uncertainty in human participants Fourteen human volunteers participated in Experiment 3. We tested the hypothesis that the visual system uses Bayesian Inference to determine the continuous displacement value of objects across saccades. The overall paradigm was similar to Experiments 1 and 2. The critical difference was that the target was displayed post-saccadically for a limited period (100ms) and participants provided a continuous report of where they had perceived it as having landed. Participants fixated a central cross and upon being cued, made a saccade to a target located at either 10\u00ba or -10\u00ba. The target was displaced horizontally during the saccade, displayed in its new\n44\u00a0 \u00a0\nlocation for 50ms, and then replaced by a response screen. The response screen consisted of a mouse cursor that started out in the center and was restricted to the horizontal meridian to ensure that participants were solving a one-dimensional problem. Participants were required to drag the mouse cursor to the location where the target had landed and click to submit their response.\nParticipants completed a total of 1000 trials each. We first trained participants on the\nprior for 600 trials and then tested the use of this prior with increasing sensory noise. As in Experiments 1 and 2, the target was a Gaussian blob and we manipulated sensory uncertainty by varying its width. The prior was a continuous Gaussian distribution of displacements, rather than a categorical prior indicating the probability of object displacement. Throughout the experiment, displacements were drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0\u00ba and standard deviation 1\u00ba. Participants were trained on this prior in the first 600 trials with performance-based feedback. After they submitted their response, the target appeared in its correct postsaccadic location for 500ms. To indicate their degree of correctness, the color of this feedback target ranged continuously from green (correct) to red (incorrect by more than 2\u00ba). Targets in this training phase trials had a standard deviation of 0.1\u00ba (\u201clow noise\u201d).\nIn the remaining 400 trials, participants underwent a \u201ctesting\u201d trials phase they were\nprovided no feedback. These trials had one of 3 noise levels \u2013 0.1\u00ba (\u201clow noise\u201d), 0.5\u00ba (\u201cmedium noise\u201d), and 1\u00ba (\u201chigh noise\u201d). Further, throughout the experiment, in 20% of the trials, the target did not appear post-saccadically. We call these \u201cinfinite noise\u201d trials. All 4 noise levels were randomly interleaved throughout the testing phase. All data shown in Figure 3 comes from the testing phase of the experiment. We used participants\u2019 performance in the infinite noise condition as a means to evaluate how well they learned the prior in the training phase.\nSection 2.

            "text": "Two Rhesus macaques (Monkey S and Monkey T, both males) were run in a modified Saccadic Suppression of Displacement paradigm, similar to the human participants. Animals were brought into the lab in custom-made chairs (Crist Instruments, Hagerstown, MD) and their heads were stabilized using a head-post that attached to both the chair and a surgically implanted socket (Crist Instruments, Hagerstown, MD) on the skull. The socket was implanted in an aseptic surgical procedure with the help of ceramic screws and acrylic. Eye position was measured using a surgically implanted scleral search coil61,62 in one eye. All surgical and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Duke Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nIn a typical experimental session, the animals performed the behavioral task in a dark\nexperimental rig. They were positioned 60cm from an LCD monitor (1920 x 1080, 144Hz). To dissociate external sources of sensory noise from internal, motor-driven sources, the saccade target was dissociated from a visual probe (a Gaussian blob) which was displaced intrasaccadically on some trials. In the human experiments, the Gaussian, visual probe (same as the saccade target) always appeared in one of two locations on the screen and only moved horizontally. For Experiments 4 and 5 in monkeys, it could appear in one of 4 locations, \u00b110\u00b0 horizontally or \u00b110\u00b0 vertically. The saccade target was always positioned along the orthogonal cardinal direction (e.g. if the probe appeared at \u00b110\u00b0 horizontally, the saccade target would be at \u00b110\u00b0 vertically), and the probe was displaced in a direction parallel to the saccade vector. For the control experiment (with results presented in Figure 3), we simultaneously recorded from neurons while the animals performed the sessions (neural data not presented in this manuscript). Since we placed the probe within the mapped receptive field of the neuron, the probe appeared in a different location during each session.\n46\u00a0 \u00a0\nOn each trial, a fixation square (1\u00bax1\u00ba) first appeared at the center of the screen. After\nfixation had been acquired and maintained for a randomized duration of 300-500ms, the visual probe appeared at one of the 4 locations on the screen for 500-700ms. The monkey was required to maintain fixation on the central fixation square for that duration, after which the fixation square was replaced by the saccade target (1\u00bax1\u00ba) indicating to the animal they could make a saccade. Saccade initiation (defined as the time the eye crossed a threshold set at 20% of the saccade length, i.e., 2\u00b0, in the direction of the saccade) triggered the displacement of the probe on some trials. The probe was displaced in a direction parallel to the saccade. Animals were further required to maintain postsaccadic fixation for 700ms after which the saccade target was replaced by a white cross in the same location. To report that the probe had moved during the saccade, the monkey was required to make a saccade to the probe within 500ms and then fixate on it for 400ms. To report that it had remained stationary during the saccade, the monkey had to remain fixated on the cross for 1000ms. The precise timing of stimulus presentation was verified with a photodiode taped to the top left corner of the monitor, where a white square (invisible to the monkey) was flashed within the same frame as the measured stimulus.\nDisplacements were drawn from relatively broad and narrow Gaussian distributions in\nthe \u201cmovement\u201d and \u201cnon-movement\u201d conditions, respectively. Both distributions had a mean of 0\u00ba. The \u201cmovement\u201d distribution had a standard deviation of 2.5\u00ba and the \u201cnon-movement\u201d distribution had a standard deviation of 0.2\u00ba. Positive displacements were either rightward or upward, and negative displacements were leftward or downward. Priors were cued by the color of the fixation and target squares. For monkey S, green squares meant that the probe had a 0.2 probability of being displaced while magenta squares indicated a 0.8 probability of displacement. For monkey T, blue squares were associated with a 0.2 probability of displacement while orange squares were associated with a 0.8 probability of displacement.\n47\u00a0 \u00a0\nAnimals were trained on priors over multiple sessions using performance-based feedback like human participants.\nExperiment 4: Trade-off between categorical priors and visually-driven sensory uncertainty\nTo measure performance as a function of external sensory uncertainty, the visual probe in Experiment 4 was a Gaussian \u201cblob\u201d with one of three possible standard deviations: 0.5\u00ba (\u201clow noise\u201d), 1.25\u00ba (\u201cmedium noise\u201d), and 2\u00ba (\u201chigh noise\u201d) for Monkey S and 0.5\u00ba (\u201clow noise\u201d), 1.25\u00ba(\u201cmedium noise\u201d), and 1.75\u00ba (\u201chigh noise\u201d), for Monkey T. The relative frequencies of all trial 7 types (2 priors x 3 noise levels + baseline) were the same as in the categorical experiment for humans (Experiment 2). Baseline trials with white squares and 0.5 probability of displacement all had \u201cno noise\u201d visual probes. In the 0.2 and 0.8 prior conditions, 70% of trials had no noise and conformed to the displacement probability indicated by the prior. The remaining 30% of trials with low and high noise comprised a neutral \u201ctest\u201d condition with a veridical jump probability of 0.5. All 7 trial types were randomly interleaved.\nControl experiment with valid prior statistics for all noise levels We also analyzed data from a control experiment where the jump probability was the same for all noise levels. In this experiment too, we selectively manipulated external visual noise. Visual noise levels were the same as those in Experiment 4.\nExperiment 5: Trade-off between categorical priors and motor-driven sensory uncertainty\nTo measure performance as a function of internal, motor-driven sensory uncertainty, we added a condition to the experiment where monkeys did not make a saccade. They remained fixated in the center while the Gaussian, visual probe was displaced. This no-saccade condition served as the \u201clow motor noise\u201d condition and was compared to a \u201chigh motor noise\u201d condition where\n48\u00a0 \u00a0\nanimals made a saccade. The temporal structure of the no-saccade trials was identical to the trials with a saccade. No-saccade trials were implemented by assigning the location of the \u201csaccade target\u201d to be the same as the fixation square. There were three prior conditions: 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. Colors indicating the priors were the same as in Experiment 4. The visual probe had a standard deviation of 0.5\u00ba, the lowest noise condition, for all trials. All 6 trial types (3 priors x 2 noise levels) were randomly interleaved.\nSection 3. Data preparation and Analysis Measures\nData preparation Data from individual trials were analyzed post hoc to confirm that the visual probe landed in its displaced location before the end of the saccade. The saccade end time was defined as the time at which the eye velocity dropped below 0.04\u00ba/ms. For human participants, the time at which the target jump command was sent was recorded for each trial. Trials with a recorded jump time greater than 1 whole frame (8.33ms for Experiments 1 and 2, and 16.7ms for Experiment 3) before the detected end of the saccade were excluded from analysis. Participants for whom at least 90% of all trials did not meet this criterion were excluded from analyses entirely. No participants were excluded in Experiment 1, three participants were excluded from Experiment 2, and three participants were excluded from Experiment 3. For the macaque experiments, we used a photodiode to verify the exact timing of stimulus presentation. Note that the timestamp from the photodiode indicated the presentation of a white square at the top left of the screen and the monitor refreshes frames as a raster. We verified the maximum duration of a frame as being 7ms from top left to bottom right using a second photodiode. Since the probe was presented at various locations on the screen, we set the most conservative criterion such that the photodiode timestamp had to be at least 7ms before the detected end of the saccade. Individual trials that did not meet this criterion in the macaque data were excluded as well.\n49\u00a0 \u00a0"

Displacements ranged from 0-7.5\u00b0. That is, there were 75 input units for each network. Sensory noise was simulated as a Gaussian distribution of input unit activation, truncated at the two ends of the input range (0 and 7.5), such that the total activation of input units was always 1. On each trial, the distribution was centered\n55\u00a0 \u00a0\non the true displacement for the trial and the width of activation was determined by the sensory noise level. Each input unit was connected to both output units. The activation of each output unit was the weighted sum of inputs, i.e.:\n\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc4020\nwhere \ud835\udc4e is the activation of the output unit, j; \ud835\udc4e is the activation of the output unit, i; and \ud835\udc64 is the weight of the connection between input unit, i, and output unit, j.

In other words, the shape of the psychometric function is determined by the activation of the inputs and the weights between inputs and outputs. Since psychometric curves have different shapes across priors at the same point in training (e.g., Figure 2e), we assumed that the connections between inputs and outputs (and their corresponding weights) are prior-dependent. This is equivalent to the idea that distributions are learned separately across cue color contexts. We simulated the\n56\u00a0 \u00a0\nprior-dependence of the input-output relationship by simply setting up separate sets of inputs for each prior (Figure 8c).\nWe next considered how the weights between inputs and outputs might be updated. One\npossibility was that they are updated by a simple Hebbian-like associative learning rule59 where weights between two units are updated in a manner proportional to their activation. We chose a slight variation of this rule based on work by Gluck and Bower60, who showed that an errorbased learning rule, rather than a purely associative learning rule, leads to a disproportionate overweighting of infrequent events early in training.\nThe learning rule is given by:\n\ud835\udee5\ud835\udc64 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc4023\nwhere \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc64 is the change in weights between input unit, i, and output unit, j; \ud835\udefd is the learning rate, \ud835\udc4e is the activation of the input unit, i; \ud835\udc5c is the final output of unit j, and d is the desired state of output unit, j. The term \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc5c is therefore the error between the current output of the model and the desired state determined by feedback on each trial. In summary, the change in weights or learning on each trial is proportional to the activity of the input and the error of the model on that trial. This is equivalent to the Perceptron learning rule61,62. Since errors are large early in training, weight changes are relatively large too (Figure 8c, inset; red dashed arrows depict the error). Over time, as the errors get smaller, the weights asymptote towards the desired state.\nFor infrequent events such as large displacements in the low prior condition, the weight\nchanges between the event and the output early in training are relatively large (left side of Figure 8c, inset). Taking a snapshot of performance at this stage would thus result in an apparent overweighting of their contribution to the output. This rule, however, predicts that once weights asymptote towards the desired state late in training (right side of Figure 8c, inset),\n57\u00a0 \u00a0\nevents should contribute to the model\u2019s performance in a manner proportional to their relative frequencies, and psychometric curves should become parallel to one another."

Motor noise was simulated in the Bayesian model by setting the width of the nonjump distribution, \u03c3non-jump=1.5\u00b0, i.e., triple the width of the simulated experimental distribution to\n58\u00a0 \u00a0\nmimic saccadic suppression. Bayesian and discriminative model outputs were combined linearly, such that:\n\ud835\udc42 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc42 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc42 \ud835\udc4024\nwhere \ud835\udc42 is the output of the combined model, \ud835\udc42 is the output of the Bayesian model, \ud835\udc42 is the output of the discriminative model, and \ud835\udc64 and \ud835\udc64 are the weights assigned to the Bayesian and discriminative model, respectively. Further, the weights of the two component models added up to 1:\n\ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64 1 \ud835\udc4025\nWe combined the outputs of the Bayesian and discriminative models at relative weights of 0.1 and 0.9, respectively, to generate the data in Figure 8e.\n59\u00a0 \u00a0\nSupplementary figures\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Figure S1.
