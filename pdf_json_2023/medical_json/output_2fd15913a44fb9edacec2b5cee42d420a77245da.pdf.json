            "text": "In the COVID-19 pandemic, adults were at high risk of severe disease and deaths. While children are generally considered as a lower risk population [1-3], there have been cases of severe COVID-19 and also deaths reported in children. Many of these children had some underlying medical conditions [4,5]. Moreover, children are also known to be carriers of the virus and can spread the virus among the adults [6] and therefore, it is important to protect children from the virus.\nConsidering all of these issues, pediatric vaccination has been considered very important. National Health Service, United Kingdom, US Centers for Disease Control and prevention and many other medical bodies recommend vaccination of the pediatric population [7,8]. Two mRNA vaccines have been approved in the USA for the age group of 6 months to 17 years [9]. In India, an inactivated vaccine and a receptor binding domain (RBD) based vaccines have also been approved for pediatric population from the age of 5 years and above [10], though the government program has included vaccination from 12 to 17 years [11]. As of 13 Jan 2023, around 42 million children of 12-14 years and 63 million children of 15-17 years have taken COVID-19 vaccines [12].\nNVX-CoV2373, a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine was originally developed by Novavax in the USA. The vaccine has been found safe and has also shown high efficacy of 90% in adults [12,13] when the Wuhan strain was dominant. After a technology\n.

Ltd. (SIIPL). This vaccine (SII-NVX-COV2373) has been tested in Indian adults and was found safe and immunogenic with more than 92% seroconversion with different antibody assays [14]. The vaccine has been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for adults in India and received emergency use listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization in Dec 2021 [15,16]. SII-NVXCoV2373 was subsequently evaluated in the pediatric population to immuno-bridge the vaccine with the adults. Based on this study, the vaccine was further approved for 12-17 years in March 2022 [17] and 7-11 years in June 2022 [18], respectively in India. The present paper summarizes the results of this study.\nThe primary objective of this study was to assess non-inferiority of SII-NVX-CoV2373 in adolescents of 12 to 17 years age and children of 2 to 11 years separately against that in the adult participants of the same study. 15 Non-inferiority was to be demonstrated in terms of ratio of geometric mean of ELISA units (GMEU) of anti-spike IgG antibodies as well as geometric mean titres (GMTs) of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at 14 days after the second dose. Another primary objective was to assess the safety of the study vaccine in comparison to placebo in terms of solicited local and systemic adverse events, unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest.\n.

            "text": "The present study evaluated safety and immunogenicity of SII-NVX-CoV2373 in Indian children and adolescents of 2-17 years. The vaccine was highly immunogenic with more than 98% seroconversion for both anti-S IgG and neutralizing antibodies in adolescents of 12 to 17 years of age and children of 2 to 11 years of age. There was a more than 84-fold rise from baseline for both anti-S IgG and neutralizing antibodies. No AESI was reported and no causally related SAE was reported. SII-NVX-CoV2373 is safe and well tolerated in the pediatric population of 2-17 years of age.\nAn age effect was clearly seen in the immune responses. Not only did both 12 to 17 years adolescents and 2 to 11 years children age groups show non-inferior immune responses to adults, but in fact, the titers in both the pediatric age groups were higher than in adults [14]. Moreover, the titers in the 2 to 11 years age group were also higher than in the 12 to 17 years age group. It is known that the younger populations mount higher immune response as compared to older population [20].\nWe demonstrated non-inferiority of SII-NVX-CoV2373 in children against the adult age group. We did this because at the time of the study, no vaccine was approved in India for pediatric age group. As a result, we had to use placebo as a control. The vaccine efficacy was already demonstrated in adults and therefore, we used adult results as a control so as to immuno-\n.

This is the approach used in other COVID-19 vaccine studies [21- 24].\nTo our knowledge this is the first study in India in which any recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine has been tested between 2 to 5 years of age. mRNA vaccines have been tested and recommended for use in 6 month to 5 years population [8]. In general, there has been a concern of myocarditis with mRNA vaccines in younger populations [25-28]. So far SII-NVXCoV2373 has not been found to cause any related SAE or AESI in this study as well as in previous studies conducted in India, though the size of the study populations has been small.\nThe day 180 results showed decline in IgG as well as neutralizing antibodies in the vaccine group, though they were still much higher than the baseline titres and much higher than the placebo group. Seroconversion was still more than 90%. There was a substantial rise in the titres in the placebo groups compared to baseline likely due to SARS-CoV-2 infections. These results are on expected lines as seen with SII-NVX-CoV2373 in adults [14].\nThe GMTs and seroconversion in placebo groups on day 180 were significantly higher as compared to baseline as well as day 36. This was probably due to the Omicron wave that affected all age groups in the country during December 2021-March 2022. Even there, the titres were higher in the 12-17 years age group as compared to 2-11 years. Again, this could be due to higher infections in older children as compared to younger children. None of these children received a COVID-19 vaccine nor reported a symptomatic COVID-19. As of 24 July 2022, children\n.

SIINVX-CoV2373 showed high GMTs as well as seroconversions for Delta, BA.1 and BA.5 variants though slightly lower than those for the Wuhan strain. This is known with other vaccines [30]. Still such high titres indicate that vaccines based on the Wuhan strain may give protection from various variants, especially for severe disease and deaths.\nPediatric COVID-19 vaccination has faced some degree of hesitancy among parents [31-33]. One study in Canada found that despite parents' high COVID-19 vaccination uptake for themselves (88.8%), intentions for vaccinating children aged 5\u201311 years was low (56%) [34]. As a result, the vaccine coverage has not been optimum [35]. Some important reasons for the low coverage have been concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness [36]. There is also a perception that the risk for serious COVID-19\u2013associated illness is low in children [36]. On this background, the safety profile in children can be an advantage of the SII-NVX-CoV2373.\nBaseline serology and/or RT-PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 was around 10-13% in both the pediatric age groups. The corresponding value in the Phase 3 study in adults was around 33% [14]. This probably means that the first wave in 2020 as well as the second wave in 2021 and third wave in 2021-2022 in India did not affect children significantly. However, another study conducted during March-June 2021 showed a seroprevalence of 55.7% in the <18 years age\n.

While this study measured total antibodies against S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 virus, our study measured anti-N IgG antibodies. Disparities in prevalence estimate obtained using different serological assays are known [38].\nNVX-CoV2373 has shown around 90% efficacy in adults [12,13]. The immune responses by SIINVX-CoV2373 in children were much higher than that seen in adults [14]. Higher levels of all immune markers are known to correlate with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection [39]. Human challenge studies of seasonal coronaviruses reported high levels of baseline neutralizing antibodies in uninfected or asymptomatic people [40], thus indicating that high antibody titres provide protection from disease. Considering these factors, SII-NVX-CoV2373 is expected to give high degree of protection in children, at least as much as in adults.\nOur study had a few potential limitations. We excluded previous known SARS-CoV-2 infection cases from the study. However, because of this, we could assess the actual vaccine effect and no response was seen in the placebo group until 14 days after the second dose. We did not assess efficacy of the vaccine in our study population. However, NVX-CoV2373 has already demonstrated efficacy in two large studies [12,13] and therefore, SII-NVX-Cov2373 with identical composition as NVX-Cov2373 could be bridged immunologically. Severe COVID-19 has been reported in children with some underlying medical conditions [5,6] but we excluded such children from our study. Immunogenicity of Covid-19 vaccines among such children and adolescents has been lower than healthy individuals [41-44] which is expected. However, it was still an acceptable immune response [44].

This may have affected the immunogenicity results.\nTo our knowledge there are only 6 published Phase 2/3 studies of authorized COVID-19 vaccines in pediatric population for primary immunization \u2013 2 mRNA vaccines [21-24], 1 receptor binding domain vaccine [45] and 1 nonrandomized study of an inactivated vaccine [46]. Our study is the first published data in pediatric age group for the spike protein vaccine and adds to the existing evidence that COVID-19 vaccines work well in pediatric population.\nTo conclude, SII-NVX-COV2373 was safe and well tolerated in children of 2 to 17 years age group; the vaccine was highly immunogenic and showed higher immune response than in adults and also showed robust responses against various variants of concern. The vaccine may be used in the pediatric vaccination drive against COVID-19."
