    "abstractText": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a very severe X-linked dystrophinopathy. It is due to a mutation in the DMD gene and causes muscular degeneration in conjunction with several secondary co-morbidities, such cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure. DMD is characterized by a chronic inflammatory state, and corticosteroids represent the main therapy for these patients. To contradict drug-related side effects, there is need for novel and more safe therapeutic strategies. Macrophages are immune cells stringently involved in both physiological and pathological inflammatory processes. They express the CB2 receptor, one of the main elements of the endocannabinoid system, and have been proposed as an anti-inflammatory target in several inflammatory and immune diseases. We observed a lower expression of the CB2 receptor in DMD-associated macrophages, hypothesizing its involvement in the pathogenesis of this pathology. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of JWH-133, a CB2 receptor selective agonist, on DMD-associated primary macrophages. Our study describes the beneficial effect of JWH-133 in counteracting inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines release and by directing macrophages\u2019 phenotype toward the M2 anti-inflammatory one.",

            "text": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe and progressive dystrophinopathy, affects early childhood and is mainly characterized by muscle wasting, myonecrosis, and chronic inflammation [1,2]. It is an X-linked disease chiefly due to a deficiency of dystrophin protein\u2014encoded by DMD gene\u2014with an incidence of 1 in 3500 boys all over the world [3]. Dystrophin protein is a key element of sarcolemma; it creates an essential linkage between the muscle cell cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, interacting with several glycoproteins in the cell membrane (i.e., sarcoglycans, dystrobrevins, dystrobrevins, etc.) [4] and maintaining muscular structure integrity [5]. Any mutation in the DMD gene leads to dysfunction of the dystrophin protein and consequently all dystrophin-associated glycoproteinsm, which furthermore causes muscular degeneration such as DMD and the more benign Becker type of dystrophinopathy [6,7]. DMD can be better described as a multi-systemic disease (5), since, besides musculature, it also affects many other organs and districts such as the heart, lungs, nervous system, and liver [8]. Cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure are the most frequent co-morbidities in DMD patients, thus making necessary treatments with cardiac drugs and ventilatory assistance [9]. In the last two decades, several authors delineated the critical role of persistent chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of DMD [10,11]. It is mainly caused by dystrophin-deficient myofibers damage and the consequent cycles of their necrosis and regeneration [12]. Inflammation is normally fundamental for tissue restoration after damage; nevertheless, when it becomes chronic, it triggers a\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2023, 24, 3345 2 of 13\nvicious circle in which myofiber damage-related inflammation stimulates the production of further pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the immune cells infiltration in muscle. These events exacerbate the pro-inflammatory balance, causing fibrosis and stiffness in muscular tissues [13]. Since recent years, the role of resident macrophages in modulating muscle tissue metabolism emerged; the inhibition of their differentiation, indeed, has a protective role in the mouse model of DMD [14]. Macrophages are phagocytic mononuclear cells with a key role in both inflammatory processes and immune response. They can be present in two characterized and archetypal different phenotypes: \u201cM1-macrophages\u201d, or classically activated macrophages with pro-inflammatory functions, and \u201cM2-macrophages\u201d, or alternatively activated macrophages exerting anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities [15]. The imbalance in M1/M2 ratio with a M1 prevalence can be observed in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [16\u201318], which thus permits to hypothesize their involvement in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Macrophages are known to express cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), as well as all the other peripheral cells involved in immune response [19]. CB2 is one of the main elements of endocannabinoid system (ECS), a neurotransmitter system with an important role in several physiological and pathological processes, namely embryonic development, inflammation, immune response, cancer, and infection [20]. For these reasons, as well considering the protective effects observed after the proper stimulation of CB2 receptor, ECS has been proposed as a novel target for cancer, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases. [18,20\u201328]. Iron metabolism alteration delineated the inflammatory status; in particular, a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such IL-6) could cause an increase in hepcidin levels that is responsible for intracellular iron accumulation, since it induces the degradation of ferroportin-1 (FPN-1). FPN-1 is the only known iron exporter [29], whereas transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is one of the iron exporters located on cell membranes and is able to internalize the iron-transferrin complex. Iron metabolism is finely regulated in several physiological processes, and its alteration as in inflammation could actively participate to pathology onset [30]. Indeed, the use of iron chelators in clinical practice is prevalent, especially in hematological pathologies [31], and exhibits a promising proposal for other kind of diseases [17,32\u201335]. DMD therapy protocol mainly consists in the administration of corticosteroids because of their anti-inflammatory functions [36\u201340] and the consequent capability to prolong patients\u2019 ambulation. This therapeutic regimen maintains muscle strength and extends life expectancy, but corticosteroids long-term use could cause severe and very debilitating side effects (i.e., weight gain, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and depression) [41,42], thus making necessary the identification of an alternative and less toxic approach. Recently, the most intriguing therapeutical proposals are represented by stop-codon read-through therapy, gene replacement approaches, myoblast transfer therapy, and also drug-related inhibition of resident macrophages [43\u201345]. We suggest CB2 receptor agonism as an alternative, effective, and safe anti-inflammatory target for the therapy of DMD."

            "text": "Macrophages are immune cells normally involved in several processes, namely, cell death, toxin clearance, wound healing, and others, acting as a \u201cprofessional phagocytes\u201d in both physiological and inflammatory/pathological conditions [46]. They are increasingly proposed as a therapeutic target in inflammatory and immune diseases [17] as well as in cancer [47,48]. The two prototypical macrophage phenotypes are M1, or classically activated macrophages with pro-inflammatory function, and M2, or alternatively activated macrophages with anti-inflammatory properties. They are generally balanced, but the ratio of M1/M2 is in favor of M1 subtypes in inflammatory and immune disease [17,18,48,49]. In the same manner, the switch of their phenotype towards the M2 one, namely, a reduction of the M1/M2 ratio, could apport benefits in different kind of diseases [17,18]. Since recent years, a greater interest has been evolved from the scientific communities in the role of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in inflammatory diseases. CB2 receptor, a key element of ECS, is one of the main candidates in inflammatory diseases [25,50,51]. It is widely expressed on immune cells, including macrophages [19,28,52], and it is significantly de-regulated under inflammatory stimuli, thus letting hypothesize its involvement in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and immune pathologies. In literature, it is reported that the selective stimulation of CB2\u2014for example with JWH-133 selective agonist\u2014inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, thus containing the exacer-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3345 8 of 13\nbation of inflammatory response [51]. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate the possibility to target the CB2 receptor on macrophages\u2019 primary cultures, obtained from DMD patients, to ameliorate their pro-inflammatory phenotypes that were causing the symptoms affecting these subjects. Currently, standard therapy for DMD patients is based on corticosteroids (CCs) administration, thus containing the inflammation and all related symptoms they experience. Despite the beneficial and therapeutic effects of CCS, they do not guarantee a complete restoration and are also responsible for a lot of severe long-term side effects [36]. Hence, it is necessary to set up a more efficient and less toxic long-term treatment. We firstly described the inflammatory state of these patients, focusing on prevailing macrophages phenotype and on their secretory activity by studying the released cytokine profile. In literature, it has been already reported that inflammation is a typical feature of DMD; in particular, high serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-7, and other pro-inflammatory molecules have been described [53]. In accordance, we observed an elevated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 by DMD-associated macrophages. Therefore, we confirm the already well-known alteration of cytokine levels in DMD patients, but we specifically related it to the macrophage M1 prevalence, providing a deeper cellular overview of this clinical evidence. Although IFN-\u03b3 is the principal cytokine exerting a protective role in immune response against microbial infections by activating macrophages [54], a constant and continuous hyperproduction of this molecular signal leads to a deleterious state of macrophage chronic activation, namely chronic inflammation. The high levels of CCR7 and CD86 proteins and the contemporary low levels in pSTAT6 and CD206 protein expression let us speculate that this inflammatory state is both a cause and an effect of a M1 phenotype prevalence [55,56]. Further evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from the observed high intracellular concentration of iron. Indeed, although M1 cells normally show high iron content that limits growth of pathogen agents and promotes inflammation, M2 macrophages are mainly responsible for iron release [48,57]. The observed high levels of intracellular iron do not only confirm the M1 macrophages prevalence, but they are also a further signal of inflammation. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6, as we observed, indeed cause iron retention in cells by the hepcidin pathway [29,34]. Inflammation is a self-sustaining event, given the interdependent and mutually stimulating relationship among the involved compounds. In our study, it emerged that DMD-associated macrophages are principally M1 macrophages and that they express low levels of the CB2 receptor. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proper and selective stimulation of the CB2 receptor could cause beneficial effects by rebalancing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reducing iron internalization. The reduction of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and intracellular iron are clear evidence of the anti-inflammatory effect of CB2 stimulation. From our study, it emerged that JWH-133 treatment influenced iron internalization by modulating the expression of two of the main iron transporters: TfR1 and FPN-1. Indeed, although TfR1 decreased, with a consequent reduction in cell iron intake, FPN-1 increased, making more effective the iron export into extracellular environment. These results let us hypothesize that CB2 stimulation exerts its anti-inflammatory role in DMD in a double manner: by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines further release and also by reducing iron internalization in macrophages. The modulation of iron metabolism appears directly related to CB2 effects on iron transporters, TfR1 and FPN-1, but it is also clearly mediated by the IL-6/hepcidin pathway. Beyond us, other authors also demonstrated that CB2 and TRPV1 receptor-stimulating molecules\u2014for example cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid extracted from Cannabis sativa L.,\u2014reduce IL-6 release, thus triggering the hepcidin/FPN-1 cascade and exerting an anti-inflammatory role [58\u201360]. In the future, certainly, it could be interesting to unravel the depth of the underlying molecular mechanisms for the identified interactions. Being that IL-6 is an enhancer for M1 macrophages differentiation and function, its reduction contributes to the lowering of the existing M1 prevalence. Indeed, after stimulating macrophages with JWH-133, we observed an increase in pSTAT6 protein, which is a key molecule in the transition from M1 to M2 phenotype. As many authors already suggested, the phosphorylation\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3345 9 of 13\nof this protein regulates the M2 polarization, so it could be considered not only an M2 phenotype marker, but a marker of polarization progress toward the M2 type [55,56]. Our results highlight the promising possibility to target the CB2 receptor in DMD, leveraging anti-inflammatory effects mediated by macrophages, the most representative cells of the immune system, to improve short- and long-term outcomes in these patients."

            "text": "In conclusion, we discussed for the first time the inflammatory state of DMD-associated human macrophages in primary cultures and, overall, the involvement of CB2 receptor in the pathogenesis of the typical chronic inflammation affecting these subjects. Our results suggest the possibility to target the CB2 receptor with beneficial therapeutical effects, limiting the release of further pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing the differentiation of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. In future, it will be of great interest to test the effect of CB2 agonist-CCs combined use in DMD-associated macrophages. In 2019 we demonstrated that in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients, the co-administration of Dexamethasone\u2014the glucocorticoid most frequently used in ITP patients\u2014with JWH133 resulted in an extremely potentiated anti-inflammatory effect [25]. This synergism could represent a cardinal element in DMD therapy as well, allowing to reduce CCs dosage and consequently the related side effects. Certainly, further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate and translate our findings into a path to clinically practice in order to improve the therapeutic efficacy for DMD patients.\nInt.
