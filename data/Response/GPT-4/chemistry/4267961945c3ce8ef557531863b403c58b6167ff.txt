Comparative Analysis of Different Medicinal Plant Extracts with Nanocomposites for Wound Healing: Expanding the research to include various medicinal plant extracts in combination with carboxymethyl cellulose, zinc oxide, and graphite carbon nitride nanosheets. This could help in identifying more potent or efficient combinations for wound healing and antimicrobial properties, potentially leading to the discovery of novel formulations with enhanced efficacy.

Mechanistic Studies on the Photocatalytic Process in Wound Healing: Investigating the underlying mechanisms of how the photocatalytic process facilitated by the CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR nanocomposite contributes to wound healing. This would involve studying the interactions at the molecular level, the role of reactive oxygen species, and how these contribute to enhanced healing and reduced microbial load.

Development and Testing of Advanced Drug Delivery Systems: Exploring the creation of more sophisticated drug delivery systems using the studied nanocomposite that can provide controlled, sustained release of the nutmeg extract and other medicinal agents. This could include implantable devices or biodegradable films that gradually release the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner to the wound site.

Clinical Trials for Human Wound Healing Applications: Transitioning from preclinical studies to clinical trials to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and potential side effects of the CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR nanocomposite in human subjects. This would provide crucial data on its potential as a commercial wound healing product and its comparative performance against existing treatments.

Investigating the Environmental and Long-term Stability of the Nanocomposites: Assessing the environmental impact and degradation behavior of the nanocomposite materials used in the wound healing process. Understanding how these materials break down in biological systems and the environment will be crucial for evaluating their long-term safety and feasibility for widespread medical use.
