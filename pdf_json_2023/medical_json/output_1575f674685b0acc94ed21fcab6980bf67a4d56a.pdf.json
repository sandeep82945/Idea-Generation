    "abstractText": "Background Intensive care units (ICUs) are often too noisy, exceeding 70\u201380 dBA, which can have negative effects on staff. The corresponding recommendation of the World Health Organization (average sound pressure level below 35 dBA) is often not achieved. To date there is a lack of intervention studies examining the extent to which unit\u2010based noise management in ICUs contributes to a reduction in noise exposure for the staff. The study therefore aims to provide answers to 1) how unit\u2010based noise management sustainably reduces the subjective noise exposure among staff, and 2) how this intervention affects other noise\u2010related topics. Methods We performed a monocentric prospective longitudinal study with three measurement points in a German university hospital in three ICUs. We collected data from different healthcare professionals and other professional groups between October 2021 and August 2022 using an online questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inference statistics. Results A total of n = 179 participants took part in the surveys. The majority of participants were nurses or pediatric nurses. Most participants worked more than 75% full\u2010time equivalent. Staff on the three ICUs reported high levels of noise exposure. No significant changes in noise exposure over time were observed. Participants were already aware of the topic and believed that a behavior change could positively influence the noise environment. Conclusions This study provides an initial insight into how a unit\u2010based noise management could contribute to a reduction in the subjective noise exposure among staff in ICUs. The results of this study highlight the importance of this topic. Future studies should aim to research aspects of adherence and their facilitators or barriers, which pro\u2010 mote the sustained implementation of noise\u2010reducing measures by staff.

We collected data from different healthcare professionals and other professional groups between October 2021 and August 2022 using an online questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inference statistics.\nResults A total of n = 179 participants took part in the surveys. The majority of participants were nurses or pediatric nurses. Most participants worked more than 75% full\u2011time equivalent. Staff on the three ICUs reported high levels of noise exposure. No significant changes in noise exposure over time were observed. Participants were already aware of the topic and believed that a behavior change could positively influence the noise environment.\nConclusions This study provides an initial insight into how a unit\u2011based noise management could contribute to a reduction in the subjective noise exposure among staff in ICUs. The results of this study highlight the importance of this topic. Future studies should aim to research aspects of adherence and their facilitators or barriers, which pro\u2011 mote the sustained implementation of noise\u2011reducing measures by staff.\nTrial registration German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS): DRKS00025835; Date of registration: 12.08.2021.

            "text": "Intensive care units (ICUs) are designed to provide care for critically ill patients who require special attention and treatment [1]. They are equipped with a high number of medical devices to inform staff (e.g. nurses) about the health status of patients [2]. Whilst this ensures an improvement in medical and nursing care, it also contributes to significant noise emission [3]. Noise can have various causes and is not always predictable [4]. A categorization can be made into two areas: 1) Device-generated noise, such as mechanical noise [5] or alarms [6, 7] and 2) noise generated by people, such as conversations among staff and relatives [8, 9] or medical and nursing activities [10, 11].\nNoise can be considered as sound, which transports energy as a mechanical wave [12]. Sound itself is measured in the form of several technical quantities, such as the sound pressure level (unit dB) [13]. However, the perception of sound also depends to the timbre, the tonality and impulsiveness [14]. In addition personal characteristics (e.g. cultural background, human hearing) can influence the perception of sound. Moreover, perceptions may also differ in terms of physiological and psychological factors (e.g. health status, self-efficacy) [15, 16]. In this context, the sound pressure level is filtered during measurement to take these characteristics into account (unit dBA: A-weighted decibel scale) [16, 17]. According to Berglund et\u00a0al. [18], the average sound pressure level (LAeq) in ICUs should not exceed 35 dBA. A more precise distinction is made in the recommendations of the \"German Interdisciplinary Association of Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI)\", whereby the limits are classified by daytime (i.e. maximum 45\u00a0dB during the day, 40\u00a0dB in the evening, 20\u00a0dB at night) [19]. However, international studies have shown that sound pressure levels in ICUs have increased over the last 50\u00a0years and recommendations are being significantly exceeded [20\u201323].\nThe sensitive character of an ICU has already led to increased research into noise [2, 24\u201326]. Different studies have shown that noise induces stress reactions [27], which are also predictors of various symptoms and diseases (e.g. fatigue, exhaustion [28], anxiety [29], burnout, or depression [28, 30, 31]. Furthermore, noise generated by acoustic (false) alarms can affect the behavior of medical staff in terms of setting wider alarm limits or reducing their volume [7]. In addition, (false) alarms may also contribute to desensitization (alarm fatigue) [32, 33] which can affect patient safety (e.g. no reaction in case of a \"real\" alarm). Moreover, such (false) alarms can lead to annoying interruptions [3, 34] as well as errors in medical activities (e.g. preparing medications) [27, 35]. According to Sengpiel [17], this is already possible at a sound pressure level of 40 dBA.\nNoise, however, is not the only challenge medical staff face in ICU [36]. A high workload [37], which might contribute to job dissatisfaction [38], and massive staff shortages [39] are but a few aspects to note. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, these challenges have intensified even further [40]. Thus, it is important to implement measures that reduce the burden on staff in ICUs. In this regard, one strategy can be the sustainable reduction of noise.\nIn a review, Konkani and Oakley [2] describe several approaches to noise reduction in ICUs. Besides measures to change the behavior of staff (e.g. through education or noise visualization), other options include quiet times, station remodeling, or the volume adjustment of technical devices (e.g. television, telephone). However, considering the individual situation of an ICU, the authors conclude that a standardized approach to noise reduction is not realistic [2].\nUp to now, research on noise has mainly focused on objective sound measurements [1, 21, 41, 42] or on the patient\u2019s perspective [43, 44]. Staff and their subjective noise exposure, has mostly been recorded in cross-sectional surveys [10, 26, 28, 29]. To date there is a lack of intervention studies examining the extent to which unitbased noise management in ICUs contributes to a reduction in noise exposure among staff. The study therefore aims to provide an answer to the following research questions: 1) Can unit-based noise management sustainably reduce the subjective noise exposure of staff in ICUs? 2) How does unit-based noise management affect other noise-related topics (e.g. knowledge and awareness or thematization to noise)?"

Questions could be answered via a 4-point Likert scale (i.e. 1 = \"no\", 2 = \"rather no\", 3 = \"rather yes\", 4 = \"yes\"). Perceived disturbance from the noise sources was measured from 1 = \"not at all disturbing\" to 4 = \"very disturbing\", supplemented with the answer category of \"don\u2019t know\".

Regarding the first research question, we proceeded as follows: Since the questionnaire in the original publication [10] was not checked for unidimensionality, we tested the relevant items regarding noise-related strain using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). To capture the change in noise-related strain over time, we performed pre-post comparisons (i.e. T0-T1 resp. T0-T2) using t-test for paired samples (complete case analysis (CCA)). Due to a high correlation in repeated measurements, we calculated the associated corrected effect sizes [51]. To counteract biased estimation (i.e. only\nCCA) [52], noise-related strain in ICUs was additionally considered using a linear mixed model (LMM) (i.e. considering all the observations, regardless of how often they participated in the surveys and with adjustment for the variable \"general noise exposure\"). For this, we first adapted the very unequal scale value of the variable \"general noise exposure\" (range: 0\u2013100) to the dependent variable (range: 1\u20134), dividing the values of the variable \"general noise exposure\" by 10 to simplify the interpretation of the regression coefficients. In addition, prior suitability testing was carried out (i.e. consideration of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)). Concerning the second research question, we conducted all the analyses on an item level (due to missing unidimensionality in items with similar content or underidentified models within the CFAs). Pre-post comparisons (i.e. T0-T1 resp. T0-T2) were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To determine the specific direction of change for equal median and statistical significance, the respective distributions (pre-post) were compared with each other. Due to an exploratory approach, a restrictive p-value adjustment was not applied [53]. For all analyses, statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Missing values were considered descriptively and separately by the respective MP after exclusion of the variables for which no missing values were possible (e.g. ID). For all the analyses we used R (Version 4.0.2) [54] and R Studio (Version 2022.07.1) [55] with the packages psych, lavaan, lme4, nlme, rstatix."

Changing one\u2019s own behavior can contribute to noise reduction (rather yes: 45.2% resp. 42.0%; yes: 27.4% resp. 26.0%). The thematization of noise was felt to be very important (rather yes: 17.7% resp. 26.0%; yes: 82.3% resp. 74.0%). Noise is more likely to be thematized among colleagues (rather yes: 14.5% resp. 24.0%; yes = 48.4% resp. 36.0%) rather than with superiors (rather yes: 11.3% resp. 10.2%; yes = 29.0% resp. 24.5%) or in private life (rather yes: 18.8% resp. 22.0%; yes: 21.3% resp. yes = 14.0%).

The relative frequencies for all the items can be seen in Additional file\u00a01.

Again, the following results refer to the CC (i.e. T0-T1 resp. T0-T2) and their baseline statements (T0). In terms of technical devices, staff most often rated surveillance monitors (alarms) as rather disturbing (30.6% resp. 41.7%) or very disturbing (54.8% resp. 45.8%). Furthermore, mechanical ventilators (rather disturbing: 44.3% resp. 40.8%; very disturbing: 24.6% resp. 24.5%), as well as perfusors (rather disturbing: 48.4% resp. 48.0%; very disturbing: 21.0% resp. 18.0%) or telephones (rather disturbing: 35.5% resp. 30.0%; very disturbing: 43.5% resp. 40.0%) were perceived as disruptive noise sources. In the area of clinical activities or actions, the results show that staff rated the private conversations of colleagues as disturbing (rather disturbing: 40.3% resp. 32.0%; very disturbing: 33.9% resp. 28.0%). In addition, the use of the brake on the bed (rather disturbing: 24.6% resp. 18.0%; very disturbing: 37.7% resp. 38.0%), visits (rather disturbing: 33.9% resp. 34.0%; very disturbing: 22.6% resp. 22.0%), and the opening of cartons or packages (rather disturbing: 19.0% resp. 20.8%; very disturbing: 39.7% resp. 37.5%) were frequently perceived as interfering noise sources. Additional file\u00a0 2 shows the relative frequencies for all noise sources. Between T0-T1, 2 noise sources showed significant changes in the area of \"clinical activities or actions\" (i.e. using the brake on the bed, shoes (e.g. squeaking)), however the first one showed negative changes. A significant change (negative) between T0-T2 was found in the area of \"technical devices\" for one noise source (i.e. compressed air). Table\u00a06 shows all the changes in the pre-post comparison (i.e. T0-T1 resp. T0-T2) with the corresponding effect sizes.

            "text": "In our study, the staff in the three ICUs reported high levels of noise exposure. This finding is consistent with the study by Schmidt et\u00a0 al. [10], which surveyed 348 healthcare professionals in ICUs in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. A recent study in a similar setting (n = 350) also confirmed our results, with more than two-thirds of the participating staff perceiving the ICU as being too loud [26]. These results reinforce the importance of noise management in ICUs. As regards the effect of the implemented noise management, however, we were unable to observe a significant reduction in the perceived noise-related strain over time. This could be due to the constant high sound pressure levels, which will be published in another part of the overall study (Witek et\u00a0 al. forthcoming). According to Kebapci and G\u00fcner [57] one reason for the persistently high noise level could be that measures to reduce noise only have a short-term effect if the entire staff on the ICU do not consistently respect them. This seems to be a challenge since the majority of the surveyed nurses stated that they had become insensitive to the constant noise exposure [57]. However, it should be noted, that behavioral change strategies are considered to be the most effective and cost-effective approach for longterm noise reduction [2, 42]. Such strategies include educational programs and campaigns to inform staff about the harmful effects of noise exposure and ways to mitigate it or to establish a culture of accountability for noise reduction among staff, with regular reminders and discussions about the importance of a quiet environment for patients and staff [2, 10, 58, 59]."

            "text": "With regard to \"knowledge and awareness\", this study revealed that the surveyed individuals were already aware of the issue of noise prior to the implementation of noise management measures. In contrast to this, Johannson et\u00a0 al. [60] showed that staff in ICU have a lack of theoretical knowledge about noise and its negative consequences. The respondents in our study believed that changes in their own behavior (e.g. addressing alarms efficiently to prevent unnecessary noise) could contribute to noise reduction in their own ICUs. These findings are in line with those of Schmidt et\u00a0al. [10] and Ruettgers et\u00a0al. [26], who also found that staff were aware of the issue of noise exposure and believed that changes in their own behavior could positively influence the noise environment. Nevertheless, Ruettgers et\u00a0 al. [26] showed that staff perceived changes in technical equipment and adjustments to alarms as a more straightforward solution in noise management. This is also confirmed by another study in which technical modifications led to a significantly lower sound pressure level [61]. However, this could be difficult because staff assume that superiors are not open to such modification [27]. As far as changes over time are concerned, we found a positive significant difference between T0 and T2 for only one item (i.e. \"The World Health Organization recommends [\u2026]. Do you think this guideline is implemented most of the time?\"). One explanation for this may be the initial high level of knowledge and awareness among the staff about this topic. After all, the intervention also aims to increase knowledge and awareness of noise, which could be considered as achieved, as indicated by the unchanged or positively altered median values of the corresponding items between T0-T1 and T0-T2 (see Table\u00a05). In terms of \"thematization\", it is apparent that staff felt it was important to discuss the topic of \"noise\". This also indicates that the sense of disturbance is high and thus confirms our descriptive results of noise-related strain. As in the study by Ryherd et\u00a0al. [27], the exchange is most likely to take place among colleagues. It is known that superiors and subordinates often have different perceptions of responsibilities, which can lead to low quality communication between them [62]. Overall, we found a positive change in three items (T0-T1), which could indicate a decrease in the noise levels in the ICUs. In the context of \"subjective noise-sensitivity\", it appears that participants are more likely to seek quiet and are more sensitive to noise after a shift in the ICU. These results are comparable to those of Schmidt et\u00a0 al. [10] and support the findings of high noise-related strain, regardless of the MPs."

            "heading": "Individual noise sources",
            "text": "As expected, different noise sources (i.e. in the area of technical devices or clinical activities and actions) are perceived as disturbing in the ICU. Previous studies [10, 59, 63] showed that mechanical ventilators, monitors and their alarms, telephones conversations or visits are highly disruptive to ICU staff which is consistent with our results. Unfortunately, we hardly found any significant change over time in the noise sources we studied. One explanation for the failure to reduce noise exposure can be that self-hygiene of the staff is often secondary while clinical activities to ensure the survival of patients predominate [60]. On the other hand, it can be countered that the noise sources listed are not all necessarily associated with acute medical or nursing interventions. Thus, it should be considered which aspects of noise management are necessary for, and relevant to the staff. In this context, Renz et\u00a0 al. [64] describe that at work, noise sources which are not important for one\u2019s own work and information intake are mainly perceived as disturbing (e.g. private conversations by colleagues)."

One of the main strengths is that we surveyed different types of healthcare professionals, such as physicians, nurses or therapists to capture different perspectives and ensure a comprehensive understanding of this issue. Another strength is that the intervention was unit-specific, recognizing that a onesize-fits-all approach is not appropriate. However, the study also has some limitations. One limitation is that we did not adjust for multiple testing in the significant tests on \"noise-related topics\" or the \"individual noise sources\". Thus, the significant results could be random. However, due to our exploratory approach, we did not want to be too restrictive. Another limitation is that we mainly considered complete cases in our analysis. With respect to noise-related strain, we used an additional statistical method (LMM) including all the observations. In addition, the study was monocentric and the response rate for all MPs ranged from 33.68% to 41.81%, which may reduce the representativeness (i.e. nonresponse bias [65]) and generalizability of our results."

Results indicated that staff in the ICUs experienced substantial noise exposure. Nevertheless, the study failed to identify a significant reduction in the perceived noise-related strain. Staff were cognizant of the noise issue and considered the implementation of noisemanagement as important. Future interventions should aim to minimize noise from the most disturbing and relevant sources. Moreover, it is imperative to research aspects of adherence and their facilitators or barriers, which promote the sustained implementation of noisereducing measures by staff. We therefore encourage researchers to take these aspects into consideration while designing future studies. Furthermore, we are currently planning a corresponding research project ourselves.\nAbbreviations CFA Confirmatory factor analysis CI Confidence interval ICC Intraclass correlation coefficient ICU(s) Intensive care unit(s) LMM Linear mixed model MP(s) Measurement point(s)\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12912\u2011 023\u2011 01611\u20113.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
