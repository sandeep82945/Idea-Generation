    "abstractText": "Low-cost, sustainable hydrogen production requires noble metal-free electrocatalysts for water splitting. In this study, we prepared zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) decorated with CoFe2O4 spinel nanoparticles as active catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by converting agricultural bio-waste (potato peel extract) into economically valuable electrode materials. The biogenic CoFe2O4 composite showed an overpotential of 370 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 and a low Tafel slope of 283 mV dec\u22121, whereas the ZIF@CoFe2O4 composite prepared using an in situ hydrothermal method showed an overpotential of 105 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122 and a low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec\u22121 in a 1 M KOH medium. The results demonstrated an exciting prospect of high-performance noble metal-free electrocatalysts for low-cost, high-efficiency, and sustainable hydrogen production.",

            "text": "Due to the increasing global demand for renewable energy and the effects of climate change, developing clean, environmentally sustainable energy sources has become extremely important in the twenty-first century [1\u20133]. Although sunlight and wind are abundant natural sources of renewable energy, their harvest requires highly sophisticated processing techniques and strongly depends on the geographical location [4,5]. Hydrogen is the primary sustainable source of renewable energy. Since the last century, water electrolysis has emerged as a promising method of producing high-purity hydrogen. Due to the increasing availability of electricity generated from renewable sources, water electrolysis has recently gained immense attention in hydrogen production. The general water-splitting reaction comprises two half-responses: i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode [6,7].\nHER 2H+ + 2e\u2212 = H2 (1)\nOER 2H2O = O2 + 4H+ + 4e\u2212\nOverall 2H2O = O2 + 2H2\nBoth the HER and OER are kinetically favorable and require some overpotentials to achieve the desired reaction rate. Water splitting theoretically requires a Gibbs free energy (G) of approximately 237.2 kJ mol\u22121 to enable the thermodynamically uphill reaction in the electrolyzer [8]. However, the unfavorable thermodynamics and the resulting large overpotential of water electrolysis limit large-scale hydrogen generation [9,10]. The highest water splitting efficiency to date was reported using noble metal-based electrocatalysts, particularly Pt-based catalysts, for the HER and Ir/Ru-based catalysts for the OER [11\u201313].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9585. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24119585 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9585 2 of 13\nNonetheless, the scarcity and high cost of precious metals significantly restrict their applications in commercial water splitting. Therefore, the development of non-precious alternatives with excellent activity and durability is imperative [14]. Biogenic materials are drawing increasing attention due to their sustainability. Some biogenic materials are renewable and can be obtained from waste products, which significantly reduces their production cost [15\u201317]. More importantly, biogenic materials can be engineered to have specific catalytic properties, making them useful for selective reactions [15]. These materials become environmentally friendly alternatives to synthetic catalysts because they are biodegradable and non-toxic. In addition, biogenic materials exhibit improved stability and activity compared to synthetic catalysts, suitable for specific applications in fuel cells and water splitting. Overall, using biogenic materials in electrocatalysis can potentially contribute to the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies. Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) [18,19], which are composed of organic ligands and metal ions or clusters, are a new class of highly porous materials with high crystallinity and a long-range order [20]. Numerous MOFs have been employed for electrochemical water splitting due to their intrinsic properties, such as their large surface area, customizable chemical components, configurable pore architectures, and various topologies [21\u201324]. Additionally, the characteristics of MOFs can be modified by coupling them with a variety of functional materials, including polyoxometalates, metal compounds, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and other conductive substrates to generate MOFs or MOF/substrate composites [25\u201330]. The excellent water-splitting performance of such composites can be attributed to their increased active sites and conductivity due to functionalization. Furthermore, the MOF-based template enables the molecular and atomic-level rearrangement of the components during stacking with other materials. Over the past decades, various MOF-based electrocatalysts have been reported. Among them, zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF), composed of imidazole linkers coordinated to transition metals, such as Zn2+, is a suitable MOF to support heterogeneous catalysts because its large pore size can allow the transport of large reactant and product molecules [31,32]. Moreover, the metal centers within the ZIF-8 structure can undergo redox reactions, enabling efficient electron transfer during electrochemical reactions. This redox activity contributes to the catalytic performance of ZIF-8 as an electrocatalyst, facilitating the desired electrochemical transformations. The unique structural features of ZIF-8, such as the presence of confined nanocages and open metal sites, allow for selective catalytic activity towards target reactions. This selectivity, combined with the high catalytic efficiency, makes ZIF-8 electrocatalysts promising for energy conversion and storage applications [33\u201335]. The porous nature of ZIF-8 facilitates the efficient mass transport of reactants and products. Its interconnected framework enables the diffusion of species through the catalyst, improving reaction kinetics and minimizing concentration polarization [33,36]. On the other hand, magnetic materials are ideal catalyst supports as they can be recovered easily without centrifugation or filtration [37]. However, pure magnetic nanoparticles tend to aggregate and cannot disperse uniformly throughout the reaction system. Incorporating magnetic nanoparticles into porous materials can prevent their aggregation and create a magnetic heterogeneous catalyst [32,37\u201339]. The magnetic composites have several advantages, including catalytically active surfaces and a magnetic separation capability. Moreover, some magnetic nanoparticles have multiple oxidation states and are expected to be electrocatalytically active, such as NiCo2O4 [40], NiMoO4 [41], Co3O4 [42], NiO [43], and MnO2 [44]. Spinel ferrites, denoted as MFe2O4 (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Cu, etc.), are a type of binary/ternary metal oxide. These ferrites are highly desirable because of their low cost, earth abundance, magnetism, catalytic activity, and conductivity [45\u201347]. They are composed of Fe, Co, and Ni, which are typically used to fabricate highly efficient OER catalysts [48\u201351]. However, only a few studies have focused on the application of spinel ferrites as OER electrocatalysts. For instance, Guo et al. prepared a series of MFe2O4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, and Mn) spinel nanofibers for the OER. Among them, CoFe2O4 showed the lowest overpotential of 408 mV at the current\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9585 3 of 13\ndensity of 5 mA cm\u22122 [46]. Furthermore, polyaniline CNTs and carbon were used to modify the spinel CoFe2O4, and their overpotentials decreased to 314 and 378 mV, respectively [52,53]. Additionally, in 2017, Lu et al. reported a MOF-based CoFe2O4/C composite with an overpotential of 240 mV, which is one of the lowest values reported for ferrite-based catalysts [54]. However, this overpotential is still too high for a practical OER. Inspired by these observations, herein, we report a unique strategy to utilize food waste to synthesize biogenic electrode materials in a cost-effective, eco-friendly, and simple manner (Scheme 1). Potato peels were used as a precursor for the synthesis of ZIF@CoFe2O4 composites. According to the US import/export report, South Korea produces approximately 530,000 metric tons of potatoes annually. Potato peel comprises starch, polysaccharide, protein, acid-soluble and acid-insoluble lignin, and lipids. The lipid fraction contains long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, triglycerides, and sterol esters. This composition can be used as a natural polymeric precursor. Therefore, waste potato peels can be a great source of chemical precursor, such as biogenic surfactant, for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles that can control the growth of the NPs and inhibit aggregation. Therefore, waste potato peels can be a great source of biogenic precursors for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. Interestingly, the synthesized ZIF@CoFe2O4 composite showed excellent electrocatalysis toward the OER in a 1 M KOH solution. The enhanced catalytic activity of the composite was attributed to the synergistic interaction between the transition metals Co\u2013Fe and Zn. This facile approach may open up new opportunities for the utilization of bio-waste in the preparation of well-defined nanostructures.\nInt. J. Mol.

The CoFe2O4/ZIF-8 had a larger Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) area than CoFe2O4 due to the large surface area of ZIF-8. The specific BET surface areas of the CoFe2O4, ZIF-8, and CoFe2O4/ZIF-8 were approximately 620, 1040, and 580 m2 g\u22121, respectively. ZIF-8 showed a typical type-I nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm [32]. The list of average pore diameter from BET measurements have been summarized in Table S2. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the CoFe2O4, ZIF-8, and CoFe2O4/ZIF-8 composite was performed in a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Figure 1d, the TGA curve of ZIF-8 exhibited a total weight loss of 75% up to 700 \u00b0C. In contrast, the weight loss of CoFe2O4 was only 40%, which was attributed to the elimination of the H2O adsorbed on the particle surfaces. Moreover, in the initial stage, the weight loss of CoFe2O4/ZIF-8 (31%) was caused by the vaporization of the adsorbed water or methanol.

The blank carbon paper electrode (CPE) was not active for OER, whereas the ZIF8 electrode showed a current of 20 mA at 1.5 V vs. RHE. In contrast, the cathodic current for CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 shifted toward a more positive potential and reached 40 mA at 1.5 V vs. RHE. However, the LSV curve of the pure ZIF-8 and CoFe2O4 had some fluctuating signals due to their overly compensated iR. Moreover, Figure 4c shows that CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 required a much lower overpotential (105 mV) than CoFe2O4 (370 mV) and ZIF-8 (310 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. The lowest overpotential for CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite was attributed to the synergistic interaction between Zn and the transition metals present in CoFe2O4. CoFe2O4 decoration increased the charge transfer capability of ZIF-8, decreased the energy barrier of the CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite, and accelerated the OER kinetics. CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 exhibited the lowest onset potential of 1.35 V among all the catalysts investigated (1.59 V for ZIF-8). This indicated that the oxygen ion adsorption capacity of CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 increased, and the catalytic activity toward the OER was improved because of the synergistic effect between the transition metals.

In contrast, the Tafel slopes of the ZIF-8 and CoFe2O4 were 120 and 283 mV/dec, respectively. The lowest Tafel slope of CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 indicated that it had the fastest charge transfer kinetics during the OER, and the rate-determining step followed the Volmer OER mechanism. The OER activity of the CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 catalyst was compared with those of previously reported Co\u2013Fe metal oxide-based catalysts (Table 2). The CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite is a\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9585 8 of 13\npromising high-performance OER electrocatalyst because of its low overpotential and Tafel slope.\nAs shown in the Nyquist plots (Figure 4d) obtained through an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite exhibited a smaller semicircle than the other two catalysts, indicating its higher conductivity, which could positively affect the electrocatalytic activity of an electrode. The Nyquist plots of the catalysts were fitted using EC laboratory software (Version B11.41). An equivalent circuit consisting of an Ohmic resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and constant phase element (Q) was built. The space charge layer capacitance (C) of the composite was calculated using the Brugg Equation (2).\nC = (R\u00b7Q)1/\u03b1/R\n1 R = 1 RS + 1 Rct\n(2)\nThe Rct value of ZIF-8 (210 \u2126) was lower than that of CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 (57 \u2126). The CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite showed the lowest impedance, indicating that the synergistic effect of Co and Fe effectively improved the charge transport kinetics of the MOF. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) plays an important role in electrocatalysis. To calculate the ECSA, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured with different scan rates in a non-faradic potential window of 0\u20130.25 V. The double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the bare electrode, ZIF-8, CoFe2O4, and CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite was calculated by plotting the current density between anodic and cathodic sweep vs. the scan rate (20\u2013120 mV). As shown in Figures 4e and S6, the fitted slope is twice the Cdl, and all the fitted graphs show high linearity. The ECSA was calculated by using the bellow equation: ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs is the specific capacitance in an alkaline electrolyte (0.040 mF\u00b7cm\u22122). CoFe2O4@ZIF8 composite had a higher ECSA (260) than bare electrode (0.95), ZIF-8 (85), and CoFe2O4 (35), indicating a higher density of catalytic active sites in CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 due to the synergistic interaction between Zn, Fe, and Co. The long-term stability of the CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite electrode was tested using a chronoamperometry method at two different potentials (1 V and 1.5 V). At 1 V, the electrode material was stable for up to 10 h. After increasing the potential to 1.5 V, a significant increment in current was observed (Figure 4f). Post-OER stability characterization showed that the crystallinity and morphology of the CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite electrode remained unchanged (Figure S7).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9585 9 of 13"

            "text": "Inspired by nature, we developed a unique, cost-effective method to synthesize biogenic CoFe2O4-decorated ZIF-8 composites for highly effective OER. A potato-peel-derived extract was used as a natural precursor for the synthesis of the CoFe2O4 particles. The average particle size of CoFe2O4 was approximately 15 nm. The spherical CoFe2O4 particles and highly porous ZIF-8 in the CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 created many catalytically active sites and facilitated the diffusion of the electrolyte ions to the active electrode. The synthesized CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite exhibited a low onset potential (0.5 V at the current density of 10 mA cm\u22121). In addition, the composite demonstrated excellent cycle stability and chronoamperometric stability for up to 10 h and retained 95% of its initial capacity. The overpotential of the CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite was 105 mV, the lowest value reported for spinel metal oxide materials. Thus, the eco-friendly synthesis approach proposed in this study paves the way for preparing magnetic materials from biogenic waste. Overall, the current research on CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 as an electrocatalyst highlights its promising prospects in energy conversion and storage technologies. Its unique composite structure and synergistic effects provide new opportunities for designing efficient and stable electrocatalysts, contributing to the development of sustainable energy solutions. Furthermore, because the CoFe2O4@ZIF-8 composite prepared in this study shows high electrocatalytic efficiency and low overpotential, the synthesis method is a potential approach for preparing green renewable energy sources.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24119585/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: A.P.: Design, Conceptualization, formal analysis, investigation, and draft writing.
