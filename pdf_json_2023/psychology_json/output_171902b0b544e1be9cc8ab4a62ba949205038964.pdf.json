    "abstractText": "The pyrolysis oil fraction is highly attractive for pyrolysis products. A simulated flowsheet model of a waste tire pyrolysis process is presented in this paper. A kinetic rate-based reaction model and equilibrium separation model are created in the Aspen Plus simulation package. The simulation model is effectively proven against experimental data of literature at temperatures of 400, 450, 500, 600 and 700 \u00b0C. Also, the developed model was employed to investigate the impact of temperature on the pyrolysis procedure and demonstrated that there is an optimum temperature for chain fractions. The optimum temperature to have the highest amount of limonene (as a precious chemical product of waste tire pyrolysis process) was found 500 \u00b0C. The findings indicated that the pyrolysis process is ecologically benign, although there is still space for development. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to see how altering the heating fuel in the process would affect the non-condensable gases produced in the process. Reactors and distillation columns in the Aspen Plus\u00ae simulation model was developed to assess the technical functioning of the process (e.g., upgrading the waste tires into limonene). Furthermore, this work focuses on the optimization of the operating and structure parameters of the distillation columns in the product separation unit. The PR-BM, as well as NRTL property models, were applied in the simulation model. The calculation of non-conventional components in the model was determined using HCOALGEN and DCOALIGT property models.",

A simulated flowsheet model of a waste tire pyrolysis process is presented in this paper. A kinetic rate-based reaction model and equilibrium separation model are created in the Aspen Plus simulation package. The simulation model is effectively proven against experimental data of literature at temperatures of 400, 450, 500, 600 and 700 \u00b0C. Also, the developed model was employed to investigate the impact of temperature on the pyrolysis procedure and demonstrated that there is an optimum temperature for chain fractions. The optimum temperature to have the highest amount of limonene (as a precious chemical product of waste tire pyrolysis process) was found 500 \u00b0C. The findings indicated that the pyrolysis process is ecologically benign, although there is still space for development. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to see how altering the heating fuel in the process would affect the non-condensable gases produced in the process. Reactors and distillation columns in the Aspen Plus\u00ae simulation model was developed to assess the technical functioning of the process (e.g., upgrading the waste tires into limonene). Furthermore, this work focuses on the optimization of the operating and structure parameters of the distillation columns in the product separation unit. The PR-BM, as well as NRTL property models, were applied in the simulation model. The calculation of non-conventional components in the model was determined using HCOALGEN and DCOALIGT property models.\nGlobally, rising waste tire production is posing a significant economic and environmental concern1. Natural resource depletion and crude oil depletion, from which synthetic rubbers are made, are also economic issues2\u20137. Eco-friendly issues are mostly associated with the enormous piles of stocked waste tires3,4,6\u201311. Waste tires have been used in processes such as retreating, grinding, incineration, material recovery, energy recovery and pyrolysis12. Blending crumb rubber beside asphalt for highway formation, burning for power and/or steam production, and reprocess in the making of plastic and rubber products as a filler are all traditional strategies for reducing waste tire stocks13. Nevertheless, these methods are matured as they are charged with economic\u2014high capital and operating costs of amenities\u2014and environmental tasks\u2014toxic compounds emissions. The conventional technique for treating waste tires is to employ tire-derived-fuel (TDF) for energy recovery, with the bulk of TDF being used in cement kilns. This application has some limitations, such as control of emission, product quality management, and alterations required to support TDF14\u201317. Hence, pyrolysis of discarded tires is a viable alternative technology for recovering both energy and valuable compounds from the products3,7.\nDepending on the process circumstances, pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that aims to produce various gaseous, liquid, and solid energy carriers. Pyrolysis is a technique that can be used to valorize waste tires by converting them into useful products. Pyrolysis of waste tires is increasing reputation as alternative procedure of waste tire recovering18\u201320. Pyrolysis is an inert heat activity that converts organic materials into low-molecular weight molecules14,21. Gas (pyrolysis gas, C1\u2013C5), a liquid phase (oil, C6\u2013C16), solid compounds such as metals and char or (C20\u2013C24) is produced during pyrolysis process from the organic rubber material in waste tires18,19,22\u201324. The high volatile content of waste tires results in high yields of various products including pyrolysis gas, pyrolysis char, and pyrolysis oil16,22. The produced gas from pyrolysis process possesses high energy in the range of \u2212 29.9 to 42.1\u00a0MJ\u00a0 m\u22123. It depends on the tire brands used in the pyrolysis process\u2014and it is mostly used as\nOPEN\n1School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi\u2019an Technological University, Xi\u2019an 710021, China. 2Department of Petroleum and Chemical Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran. 3Department of Applied Science, Technological University of the Shannon, Midlands Midwest, Moylish, Limerick V94 EC5T, Ireland. *email: taghvaiali@yahoo.com\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:6090 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33336-3\nalternative fuel in the pyrolysis process23,25\u201327. The pyrolysis char comprises the tire\u2019s inorganic material (silicates, zinc oxide, ash, steel, etc.) as well as non-volatile carbon black14,28,29. After activation and upgrading, the char is able to be applied as activated carbon or fuel in the tire assembly procedure14,28,30. The reactor-based produced volatiles are cooled in a condenser. Then after, an oil product is achieved and separated from the non-condensable gases which is important in this process31. The pyrolysis oil fraction is highly attractive for pyrolysis products.\nThe calorific value of tire-derived oil (TDO) is approximately between 40 and 44\u00a0MJ\u00a0 kg\u22121 and is generally utilized as an alternative fuel, either alone or in combination with diesel29,32\u201334. TDO has a broad range of boiling points (about 50\u00a0\u00b0C to over 350\u00a0\u00b0C)29. The formation of treasured chemicals including xylene, styrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene (BTEX) and limonene can be increased with decreasing pyrolysis pressure10, and temperature35\u201337. In previous studies, the impact of the pyrolysis temperature and heating rate on the chemical composition of the TDO was investigated as it has a significant role in limonene production10,36,38\u201341.\nIt should be noted that in the software of Aspen Plus, equilibrium reaction models (kinetic free) were used to simulate the pyrolysis process as well as the gasification of polymers, coal, biomass, and tire feeds42\u201344. However, the classification of products of the pyrolysis process was not performed in the developed model and was not related to the design equations of the process. To improve the accuracy of equilibrium-based models, several methods have been suggested (e.g., using experimental results, quasi-equilibrium temperature approach, and kinetic models). Because of the difficulties in obtaining reaction parameters from experimental data, makes the model restricted to operating conditions (e.g., specific feed). Although the quasi-equilibrium temperature approach43 broadens the applicability of the model, specifically for gasification simulation, it makes it less accurate for pyrolysis simulation and unable to provide enough data to justify the design equations. Kinetic models, on the other hand, are supplementary precise and more detailed than equilibrium models, but they are also more computationally precise and complicated. In the open literature, there are numerous kinetic models for the pyrolysis of various feeds45\u201348. However, due to the various and intricate dynamics involved, developing such a simulation remains a big problem, hence using rate-based kinetic model would be significantly interesting. This paper describes the development of the power-law kinetic model in Aspen Plus and the validation with literature experimental data as much as possible or created exactly for the certain systems modelled in Aspen Plus\u00ae for limonene production. This work also focuses on the optimization of the operating and structure parameters of the reactor and distillation columns in the product separation unit as well as investigation to find the appropriate heating rate and temperature in terms of having the highest limonene amount in waste tire pyrolysis process.\nModeling approach Conceptual process flow sheet. The tire pyrolysis in this research is represented in Aspen Plus simulator (Fig.\u00a01). The conceptual process considered here is developed model from published process for pyrolytic conversion of waste tire to hydrocarbons (TDO)35,49,50.\nThe pyrolysis reaction stage was represented in the flowsheet as a mix of a stoichiometric reactor, a plug flow reactor, and distillation columns. The non-conventional solid feed elements were converted into their conventional essential element by the preset stoichiometric reactor (Reac1), which operated at 400\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C under 1\u00a0atm. The products exiting the stoichiometric reactor were in vapor phase except char black and metal ash. Then, the reactor, including reaction kinetic model to convert waste tire to liquid, solid and vapor was modeled. Temperatures changing from 400 to 700\u00a0\u00b0C were used to simulate pyrolysis reactions using the selected flow rate. Also, reactor dimensions which were used in the simulation were a diameter of 0.15\u00a0m and length of 1.7\u00a0m length for production of oil as well as gas products conferring to the specified kinetics in Table\u00a01 based on Ismail et\u00a0al.35. A separator 1 separated the non-vapor products from the vapor products.\nIn a heat exchanger 1 and cooler 1, cooling water was used for the cooling of the vapor product from 400\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C to 35\u00a0\u00b0C, and it was chilled to lower its boiling temperature. A separator 2 separated the stream into a liquid comprising oil products as well as a vapor phase carrying non-condensable gas products. There was no solid material predicted in the oil feed to separator 2 (knocked out drum) that may cause blocking of the trays or loading substance in the separation columns51. The pyrolysis section\u2019s oil supply stream is pushed to 200\u00a0kPa. Before being fed into the first distillation column, the oil is compressed, and the compounds lighter than the limonene cut compound are released as vapor. The bottoms stream is then delivered to the second distillation column, where the components weightier than the limonene cut are released as bottoms products (heavy TDO), leaving just the limonene-rich cut as the liquid distillate product. Diethylene glycol was added to the second\nREAC1\nDC2 B1DC1\nSEP2 HEX2\nP1 HEX1\nSEP1\nREAC2\nTIREFEED\n1 8\nLIMONENE\nTDO\n9\nDEG\n107\nGAS\n4\n11\n5\n3\n6\nOIL,GAS 2\nCHAR\nFigure\u00a01.

The investigated entrainers by Ngwetjana52 included diethylene glycol (DEG), triethylene glycol (TEG), n,n-dimethylformamide (DMF), n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (MP), quinoline, 4-formylmorpholine (4-FM) and tetratethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEDE). RCM technology was employed to determine entrainer feasibility by showing alteration of the relative volatility of the dl-limonene and p-cymene mixture and ability in their separation. DEG was introduced as a probable entrainer as it resulted in the creation of heterogeneous azeotropes facilitating the separation of d-limonene and p-cymene. TEG eventuated in the formation of a region for liquid\u2013liquid de-mixing, allowing the crossing of the distillation boundary. TEG was also considered as a an efficient possible entrainer. The choice between DEG and TEG was based on process economics. 4-FM could be known as a probable entrainer as it resulted in the formation of heterogeneous azeotropes, facilitating the separation of d-limonene and p-cymene but had a binodal curve (liquid\u2013liquid solubility) smaller than that observed in TEG and DEG. DMF, Quinoline and MP were not regarded as feasible entrainer. TEDE was not formed any azeotrope with any of the components.\nAmong the investigated entrainers, diethylene glycol was selected as it has a high boiling entrainer and introduces a heterogeneous azeotrope when employed as an entrainer along with economic matter.\nFeed of the reaction model and reaction kinetics. Decompositions of big hydrocarbon chains into lesser particles are the reactions that occur.\nThe feed in Aspen Plus is determined by its essential constituents rather than its chemical structure.

After that X\u2019n = 1-Xn to find the mass percentage time remaining and lump all kinetic rate constants to change equations to the firstorder kinetic model.

Tire pyrolysis reactions with estimated reaction constants to model tire pyrolysis process in the software of Aspen Plus35.\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:6090 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33336-3\nIt is necessary to define mass conversion \u201cX\u201d in terms of its constituent elements. Since hydrogen makes up 7 weight percentage of the feed and is the limiting reactant, it is appropriate to substitute the mass conversion of hydrogen (H2) for the mass conversion of tire feed (Xn) in Eqs.\u00a08\u201311. In order to substitute X\u2032n with XH2, the original rate equation in terms of X\u2032n is divided by 0.07 instead.\nThe formulas in Eqs.\u00a012\u201315 estimate the rate expression of various products (116 compounds), as given in Table\u00a01, and they take the Arrhenius form, for reaction i shown in Eq.\u00a016\nwhere the constant of A, E (kJ/mol) as activation energy, and n of the Arrhenius equation are all computed for temperatures between 400 and 700\u00a0\u00b0C. Tire was characterized with the following Proxanal and Ultanal attributes (Tables\u00a02a, b) to the product gas, oil, char, and metal35,51,53,54.\nThermodynamic models. The remainder of Fig.\u00a01\u2019s process simulation was created using native Aspen Plus unit operation blocks35,49,50. To determine the physical characteristics for all the prevalent components in the current investigation, the Peng-Robinson with a Boston-Mathias alpha function (PR-BM) property technique was selected. HCOALGEN and DCOALIGT property models were applied for the enthalpy/density calculation of tire and char36,52. Thermodynamic properties of components were estimated applying the non-random two-liquid (NRTL). in the current study\u2019s solvent recovery portion and UNIFAC property model utilized the missing values of NRTL55,56.\nFor non-ideal liquid mixes, activity coefficient property models are advised, and solvent recovery techniques are advocated in the literature57. Activity coefficient models are precise for phase equilibrium computations when binary contact factors are given. In the absence of vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium (VLE) data, the UNIFAC predictive model can be used to assess the needed constraints and create the binary parameters51.\nHeating rate and pressure. Temperature, pressure, and heating rate are the primary aspects that determine waste tire pyrolysis58,59.

The yield of aliphatic compounds boosted as the heating rate was improved, but the yield of aromatic products decreased61. When the rate of reaction was raised, higher heating rates were beneficial for the creation of limonene; nevertheless, quicker elimination of primary volatiles was necessary to reduce the happening of secondary reactions that reduce limonene10,37,39,51. Consequently, determining the optimal heating rate was important in the pyrolysis process. The maximum efficiency of oil was found at a heating rate of 10\u00a0\u00b0C/min among 5, 10, 15, and 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min, as an example38. On the other hand, Williams and Brindle37 investigated the cause of adjusting the heating rate from 1 to 80\u00a0\u00b0C/min and discovered that the highest oil heating rate was achieved at 15\u00a0 \u00b0C/min54. Several investigations in the literature have used a pyrolysis pressure = 100\u00a0kPa as the optimal working pressure33,36,62\u201365. Pyrolysis in vacuum lowered volatile residence duration by enhancing diffusion of volatiles to the outside of the tire element due to the produced positive pressure gradient18,65. A rise in residence time generated a growth in gas yield at the price of oil efficiency because of longer residence times promoting the happening of secondary reactions and breaking of the oil product into gas58,66,67. Increased volatiles residence time may result in a decline in char yield because of high contact times of the char product with volatile compounds, that could result in secondary reactions such the Boudouard reaction58,66.\nResults and discussion Influence of DEG amount. The remnant limonene in extract stream of second distillation column, where DEG is created to eliminate remnant impurities is recycled to first distillation column. Limonene was increased with increasing DEG, Fig.\u00a02. In the current work, the second distillation process used a solvent to investigate the recovery of limonene from TDO as high as possible68. The process of increasing limonene recovery from TDO using DEG as the solvent is used in this study. Increasing amount of DEG has better effect on limonene purity (Fig.\u00a02).\nEffect of stage. The difficulties of splitting p-cymene and limonene by conventional distillation was demonstrated in the experimental work10. As a result, improved distillation methods are needed to split these two components, which is why extractive distillation was used in this study to recover limonene from the limonenerich stream. In this investigation a straightforward process design was done rather than a big, complex system with numerous process steps to create, recover, and purify a variety of products.\nThere is no solid material in the oil feed to the distillation column that might cause blocking of the trays or filling substances in the distillation column. A RADFRAC distillation column model was also used to model the first distillation column. The supreme constraints are a reflux ratio of 11, a distillate/feed = 0.2, and a feed location at stage 9 based on the findings of sensitivity analysis at number of stages of 20. The heavy TDO was almost unchanged with changing number of stages in column 1. The changes number of stages from 13 to 20 increased limonene purity slowly and more than 20 stages was almost constant (Fig.\u00a03). The increase in limonene recovery was attributed to the inclusion of more stages in the stripping part of the column when feed stage is fixed, allowing for additional interaction with the hot vapors and thus increased limonene stripping.\nIncreasing the reflux ratio caused to decrease the recovery rate of limonene. It was shown in Fig.\u00a04. The decrease in limonene vaporization assigned to the reboiler\u2019s lowering energy input to fulfill the reducing refluxing needs. As a result, the limonene was stripped less, resulting in a high limonene recovery in the bottoms product. Furthermore, Fig.\u00a05 illustrates the influence of distillate-to-feed ratio on limonene purity. It was found that there is a bit increase in the limonene purity when distillate-to- feed ratio enhanced from 0.15 to 0.2. However, it was decreased from about 0.9 to 0.78 with the enhancement of distillate to feed ratio from 0.20 to 0.30.\nThe final RADFRAC column parameters for the first distillation column are illustrated in Table\u00a03a. Atmospheric pressure is used in the second distillation column, and the condenser pressure is set at 100\u00a0kPa. The first column should ideally be a packed column. Packed columns are ideal for insignificant diameters, temperaturedelicate items, and challenging separations requiring multiple stages69,70. Structured packing is advantageous for these activities because it can provide a height equal to theoretical plate (HETP) of less than 0.5\u00a0m and a\n0.9955\n0.9957\n0.9959\n0.9961\n0.9963\n0.9965\n0.9967\n0.9969\n0.9971\n0.9973\n0.9975\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\nPu rit\ny of\nli m\non en\ne\nDEG (kg/h)\nFigure\u00a02.

As a result, based on these HETP, a stage pressure drop of 50\u00a0Pa was established.\nDespite the significant reduction in pressure drop, working at atmospheric pressure results in a reboiler temperature of roughly 210\u00a0\u00b0C. It should be remarked that at these temperatures, thermal breakdown of certain components may occur, resulting in packing material fouling. Because the effective cross-sectional area available to vapor flow affects the capacity of a packed column, this would diminish separation capacity69,70,72,73. The impacts of hold-up must be evaluated in such circumstances. When compared to plate columns, liquid hold-up is usually much lower for packed columns71. Final operating parameters for the second column were shown in Table\u00a03b.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a06, the recovery of limonene increased with increasing stages number and 18 stages as an optimum stage was selected to be able to divide limonene from other TDO.\n0.95655\n0.95657\n0.95659\n0.95661\n0.95663\n0.95665\n12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 Pu\nrit y\nof li\nm on\nen e\nNumber of stages\nFigure\u00a03.

Limonene recovery decreased with a rise in boil up ratio for reflux ratios below 10 as more bottom\u2019s product is vaporized and reverted as boil up. Number of stages were not so effective on limonene purity, Fig.\u00a06. For reflux ratios below 10, limonene recovery diminishes as the boil-up ratio rises, since more bottom product is vaporized and recovered as boil-up, Fig.\u00a07. There is no difference in recovery at a reflux ratio of ten because the greater reflux ratio counteracts the effects of risen boil-up44.\nParameter Value\n(a)\n\u00a0Number of stages 20\n\u00a0Reflux ratio 11-mass\n\u00a0Distillate/waste tire 0.2-mol\n\u00a0Feed stage 9\n\u00a0Feed temperature 170\u00a0\u00b0C\n(b)\n\u00a0Number of stages 18\n\u00a0Reflux ratio 3-mass\n\u00a0Boil up ratio 4-mass\n\u00a0Feed stage 9\n\u00a0Feed temperature 170\u00a0\u00b0C\nFigure\u00a06.

The most typical temperatures for waste tire pyrolysis are 425\u00a0\u00b0C to 600\u00a0\u00b0C, with 500\u00a0\u00b0C being the most prevalent in the assortment22,26,29,36. By enhancing the pyrolysis temperature from 450 to 475\u00a0\u00b0C, Cunliffe and Williams21 noticed that the oil output rose and peaked at 475\u00a0\u00b0C63. Cunliffe and Williams21 found that oil yield declined as temperature increased from 475 to 600\u00a0\u00b0C, with a comparable rise in gas yield63. Secondary reactions involving the breakdown of higher molecular types into gaseous products were also blamed. The best temperature for oil yield was 450\u00a0\u00b0C, which was chosen from 400, 450, and 500\u00b0C38. The ultimate pyrolysis temperature was enhanced from 500 to 700\u00a0\u00b0C, and the aliphatic fraction concentration in the pyrolysis oil reduced from 15.1 to 6.1\u00a0wt%, while the aromatic fraction concentration rose from 65.3 to 79.3\u00a0wt%36. When the temperature rises, the production of limonene drops, but the yield of aromatic chemicals like BTX rises noticeably. At temperatures exceeding 500\u00a0\u00b0C, limonene decomposes into aromatics including toluene, trimethylbenzene, xylene, m-cymene, benzene, and indane37,39.\nBy repeating the simulation at various temperatures and monitoring the quantities of products generated, the effect of temperature was investigated. In this research, as it is shown in Table\u00a04, the highest limonene and TDO was obtained at 500\u00a0\u00b0C and gas amount was increased by increasing temperature while char was decreasing by increasing temperature. The similar results were obtained by other researches10,22,63,74.\nThe result differences in different temperatures in this simulation were similar to the experimental results of Choi et\u00a0al.36. Table\u00a05 compares the simulated and experimental results at the heating rate and temperature of 10\u00a0C\u00a0 min\u22121 and 450\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. As can be seen in this table, the liquid percentage significantly increased. Higher liquid percentage was obtained in this simulation compared with the experiment of Uyumaz et\u00a0al. because of the selected separation methods38. It will be recommended to do the experiment of this modelling in future.\nFor the main oil products, gasoline and diesel, an energy analysis was carried out at a wide range of temperature (300\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C) to ascertain the process efficiency. Both gasoline and diesel contain hydrocarbons in the C4\u2013C10 range as well as those in the C11\u2013C21 range respectively. The liquid and char products are reduced as the temperature rises, but the aromatic and gas products are increased. Owing to the fact that diesel is made up of large hydrocarbon chains, the decomposition of these chains occurs more frequently as the temperature rises, as shown in Table\u00a04. This correlates to the reduction in the combustion power produced by diesel. While the composition of gasoline with shorter hydrocarbon chains grows as the temperature rises, increasing the amount of combustion power. The net power generated improves with temperature and greater values of energy is accessible for this reforming. It is primarily caused by the cracking of large chains into smaller ones and the reformation of the smaller chains (liquid) to their corresponding aromatic structures.\nConclusion A model-based investigation of waste tire pyrolysis is presented in this paper. The pyrolysis process products were predicted using a flowsheet simulation under various operational circumstances such as reactor temperature, number of stages in the distillation column, and so on. It was validated against experimental data36,38. The simulation model was able to accurately forecast the hydrocarbon product mass fractions. The bigger hydrocarbon chains were broken into smaller ones at the optimal temperature and heating rate, as evidenced by reduced mass fractions of C10\u2013C15 and greater mass fractions of C7\u2013C9. Furthermore, more aromatics would be created, with less tar and non-aromatics. In addition, operating at low temperatures was found to be the most energy effective from a net energy aspect, with the largest quantity of diesel produced and the least amount of gasoline produced. Then, using the construction of two distillation columns to separate gas, limonene, and TDO from each other, it was attempted to attain high purity of limonene. The simulation model given in this work presents itself as a tool that will help pyrolysis plant operators to adapt to market changes in a cost-effective manner by identifying the most cost-effective operating temperatures.\nTable 4.
