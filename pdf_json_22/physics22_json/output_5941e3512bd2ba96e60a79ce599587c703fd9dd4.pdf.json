However, state-of-the-art implementation of the functional renormalization group method for pseudo-fermions have so far omitted the Popov-Fedotov projection. Instead, restrictions to zero temperature were made and absence of unphysical contributions to the ground-state was assumed. We question this belief by exact diagonalization of several small-system counterexamples where unphysical states do contribute to the ground state. We then introduce Popov-Fedotov projection to pseudo-fermion functional renormalization, enabling finite temperature computations with only minor technical modifications to the method. At large and intermediate temperatures, our results are perturbatively controlled and we confirm their accuracy in benchmark calculations. At lower temperatures, the accuracy degrades due to truncation errors in the hierarchy of flow equations. Interestingly, these problems cannot be alleviated by switching to the parquet approximation. We introduce the spin projection as a method-intrinsic quality check. We also show that finite temperature magnetic ordering transitions can be studied via finite-size scaling.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMany quantum systems of current interest, ranging from frustrated magnets [1] to Rydberg atom arrays [2] can be described by Hamiltonians consisting of spin S = 1/2 operators S = (Sx, Sy, Sz) fulfilling the standard su(2) spin algebra [1]. In theoretical treatments, it is often useful to switch to an auxiliary particle representation of the spin operator. An established representation in terms of spinful fermions annihilated by f\u03b1=\u2191,\u2193 goes back to Abrikosov [3],\nS\u00b5 \u2212\u2192 S\u0304\u00b5 = 1 2 \u2211 \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 f\u2020\u03b1\u03c3 \u00b5 \u03b1\u03b1\u2032f\u03b1\u2032 . (1)\nHere, \u03c3\u00b5 are Pauli matrices (\u00b5 = x, y, z) and an overbar indicates an operator in the fermionic Hilbert space [4].\nThe pseudo-fermion (pf) representation (1) allows for a variety of applications. For example, it is one of the pillars of the theory of spin-fractionalization and spinliquids [5] where pf mean-field states are used to describe highly entangled paramagnetic ground states of frustrated spin systems. On the other hand, the pf representation has been used extensively for numerical methods as it allows to transfer the well-developed diagrammatic toolbox for interacting fermions in equilibrium [6] to quantum spins. These tools are based on the Wick theorem and perturbation theory. Two popular examples for more advanced methods are the diagrammatic Monte Carlo [7\u20139](pf-diagMC) and the functional renormalization group (pf-fRG) [10] in vertex expansion. Whereas the first method samples diagrams of a perturbative series in J/T (J is the exchange coupling and T the temperature) [11], the second rests on a hierarchy of flow\nequations for pf vertex functions which flow under the variation of the regularized bare propagator [12, 13]. Despite the necessary truncation of this hierarchy, resulting end-of-flow correlation functions contain infinite-order resummations of certain diagram classes.\nCrucially, there is a well-known problem that appears whenever the pf representation (1) is used: While the left hand side acts in the two-dimensional spin Hilbert space spanned by {|\u2191\u3009 , |\u2193\u3009}, the basis of the right hand side\u2019s Hilbert space is extended, {|\u2191\u3009 , |\u2193\u3009 , |\u2191\u2193\u3009 , |0\u3009} and the pf spin operator is S\u0304\u00b5 = diag(S\u00b5, 0, 0). It faithfully represents a spin S = 1/2 operator only on the physical subspace {|\u2191\u3009 , |\u2193\u3009} while it acts as a S = 0 operator on the empty and doubly-occupied subspaces. As the mentioned fermionic methods are applied in thermal equilibrium, any occupation of the unphysical S = 0 subspaces will lead to differences between the physical S\u00b5 correlation functions and the pf ones (using S\u00b5 \u2212\u2192 S\u0304\u00b5) as well as between the associated partition functions Z and Z\u0304.\nFortunately, this problem can be circumvented with a trick found by Popov and Fedotov (PF) in the late 1980s [14, 15]. We will review the details of the PF trick in Sec. III. In its most simple incarnation it amounts to the addition of an imaginary valued chemical potential term to the pf Hamiltonian, H\u0304 \u2192 H\u0304 + H\u0304PF, where\nH\u0304PF = i\u03c0T\n2 (n\u2193 + n\u2191 \u2212 1) (2)\nand n\u03b1 = f\u2020\u03b1f\u03b1 is the pf number operator. Whereas the PF trick is routinely and straightforwardly employed in pf-diagMC calculations [7\u20139], this is not the case in the pf-fRG literature where only very limited attention has been paid to the subject [10, 16, 17].\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n13 48\n4v 3\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 2\n5 Ja\nn 20\n23\n2 The justifying narrative for this omission in state-of-theart pf-fRG [18\u201326] is that unphysical S = 0 states would only occur at energies above the ground state energy and consequently PF projection would be unnecessary if calculations are restricted to T = 0. However, this state of affairs comes with a number of problems:\n(i) In the following Sec. II, we show that even simple and generic frustrated spin systems like the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg trimer have a pf ground state with sizable occupation of unphysical S = 0 states if PF projection is omitted. Even if these clusters are usually not the focus of pf-fRG applications, they are basic building blocks of highly relevant lattices like triangular or Kagome. For AFM Heisenberg Hamiltonians on these lattices it is thus questionable if ground states in pf representation without PF projection are indeed in the physical subspace. As these systems have been studied amply with pf-fRG [18, 25, 27\u201330], this also questions the quantitative accuracy of these state-of-the-art pf-fRG results.\n(ii) Even for systems where the pf ground state is faithful, the unavoidable truncation of the hierarchy of fRG flow equations is an uncontrolled approximation at T = 0, where, in the absence of magnetic fields h, neither J/T nor J/h can be used to perturbatively justify the truncation. Existing arguments appealing to the correctness of commonly employed pf-fRG truncations in the large S or large N limit [23, 31] [in the sense of generalizing SU(2) to SU(N)] are not rigorously helpful in the case S = 1/2, N = 2 most relevant in applications. At best, it is the presence of the Matsubara cutoff scale \u039b which perturbatively controls the pf-fRG: As \u039b flows from infinity to zero, only ordering tendencies extracted at \u039b & J tend to be reliable, a point of view not emphasized in the literature before [32]. However, as the physical model is only recovered as \u039b\u2192 0, quantitatively reliable results for observables cannot be guaranteed by this argument. Another practical difficulty of the pf-fRG at T = 0 is the continuous nature of Matsubara frequencies, requiring major numerical efforts for a stable and reliable solution of the flow equations [33], in particular if multiloop schemes are involved [25, 26].\nIn this work, we tame problem (i) and (ii) of the pffRG by implementing the PF trick in the pf-fRG framework. We term the resulting method ppf-fRG. We show that this is possible with only minor technical modifications (see Sec. IV) so that most methodological achievements from the last decade [23, 25, 26, 34\u201337] can be seamlessly adapted. As a result, the ppf-fRG leverages the pf-fRG to finite temperatures T where quantum and thermal fluctuations compete, and the numerical implementation simplifies by the discrete nature of Matsubara frequencies. In addition, we show that the ppf-fRG is now perturbatively justified for small J/T and equipped with a method-intrinsic gauge for the quality of the results.\nIn Sec. V we benchmark the ppf-fRG using small spin clusters. Although exact results are obtained trivially for these systems, diagrammatic approaches are invoked\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\n1.0\nalready at their full complexity, making spin clusters a valuable testbed. We show that the ppf-fRG indeed yields quantitatively reliable results at large and moderate T but cannot be trusted for T smaller than about a third of J , at least for the models studied here. Surprisingly, we find that this situation cannot be improved by considering solutions of the parquet approximation. The latter is known to be in equivalence with the loopconverged limit of the multiloop fRG [38\u201340] in which the two-particle vertex is correctly obtained up to errors of order J4, i.e., one order higher than in one-loop fRG.\nBy applying the ppf-fRG to a translation invariant three-dimensional Heisenberg magnet on the cubic lattice, we show that the study of finite-temperature transitions into symmetry-broken (magnetic) phases becomes possible. In Sec. VI, we conclude and also relate our results to the recently developed pseudo-Majorana fRG (pm-fRG) [41] where by construction no unphysical sectors exist in the fermionic Hilbert space."

            "text": "In this section we substantiate our claim that there exist simple AFM spin clusters with a ground state of the pf Hamiltonian H\u0304 that \u2013 without PF projection \u2013 partially resides outside of the physical S = 1/2 sector.\n3 We use exact diagonalization (ED) of the pf Hamiltonian H\u0304 corresponding to the spin Hamiltonian H according to Eq. (1). Our examples serve to demonstrate the need for PF projection along with the pf representation [cf. (i) in Sec. I], but the small system sizes allow to disregard problems related to the solution of H\u0304, i.e. the truncation of the pf-fRG [cf. (ii)].\nThe most elementary example is the AFM Heisenberg trimer with N = 3 spins coupled all-to-all (J = 1), see (b) in Fig. 1,\nHtrimer = J(S1 \u00b7 S2 + S2 \u00b7 S3 + S3 \u00b7 S1). (3) Its degenerate physical ground state manifold is described by two of the spins forming a singlet and the third spin being in any other state. By using the pf representation (1), Htrimer \u2192 H\u0304trimer, the state with the third spin in an unphysical S = 0 configuration has the same energy (E = \u22123J/4) as the physical ground state and is therefore equally populated at T = 0. To quantify this further we consider\nCi(T ) = 4\u3008S\u0304zi S\u0304zi \u3009 = \u3008P\u0304i\u3009, (4) first studied in Ref. [25] in the context of pf-fRG. On the right side, the projector to the local S = 1/2 sector is\nP\u0304i = ni\u2191 + ni\u2193 \u2212 2ni\u2191ni\u2193. (5) Only if the (local) pf configuration is entirely in the physical subspace, S\u0304zi would be a faithful S = 1/2 operator squaring to 1/4 and Ci(T ) would be unity. Thus Ci(T ) can be interpreted as a measure for the suppression of unphysical states and we refer to it as spin projection. Returning to the trimer, we obtain Ci(T = 0) = 4/5 < 1 signaling the presence of an admixture of unphysical S = 0 states to the ground state manifold. We plot Ci(T ) for H\u0304trimer over a range of temperatures, see Fig. 1. The spin projection decreases with increasing T reaching Ci(T \u2192\u221e) = 1/2, indicating that in the T =\u221e state on the pf Hilbert space the occupation of unphysical states equals the occupation of physical states.\nBesides the trimer we found numerous other AFM Heisenberg spin clusters with N = 5 where unphysical states poison the pf ground state. This behavior can be generally observed when a physical system cannot lower its ground state energy by adding one more spin and is thus paradigmatic for frustrated systems. In that case, preparing the additional site in a physical S = 1/2 or an unphysical S = 0 state gives the same ground state energy. In Fig. 1, we show results for the bow tie (c), centered square (d) and centered tetrahedron (e), which are qualitatively similar to the trimer case (b). Since these shapes (including the trimer) are basic building blocks of the triangular, Kagome, face-centered cubic and centered pyrochlore lattice [42], respectively, it is questionable if ground states of AFM Heisenberg pf Hamiltonians H\u0304 on these lattices reside entirely in the physical subspace. Finally, from the clusters considered in Fig. 1, only the N = 2 dimer (a) has a pf ground state in the physical subspace."

I, the spin operator S\u0304\u00b5 in pf representation (1) acts like a spin-1/2 operator on the subspace {|\u2191\u3009 , |\u2193\u3009} but like a spin-0 operator on the subspaces spanned by |\u2191\u2193\u3009 and |0\u3009, respectively. Thermal occupation of the latter two sectors of the fermionic Hilbert space will thus compromise the equivalence between the spin and pf partition functions, Z 6= Z\u0304 \u2261 tr e\u2212\u03b2H\u0304 , respectively. A straightforward projection to the physical subspace using P\u0304 = \u03a0i=1,...,N P\u0304i with local projectors P\u0304i from Eq. (5) becomes unpractical for a large number of spins N .\nA more feasible projection scheme was originally proposed by Popov and Fedotov [14] and later generalized by Prokof\u2019ev and Svistunov [15]. It amounts to replacing H\u0304 \u2192 H\u0304 + H\u0304\u03c61,2PF where\nH\u0304 \u03c61,2 PF = iT [n\u2193n\u2191\u03c61 + (n\u2191 \u2212 1)(n\u2193 \u2212 1)\u03c62] (6)\nwith \u03c61,2 \u2208 R and the constraint ei\u03c61 +ei\u03c62 = 0. Now, the partition function in the pf Hilbert space can be split into a sum over the purely physical part of the Hilbert space (equivalent to Z since H\u0304\u03c61,2PF = 0 in the S = 1/2 sector) and a part containing the expectation values of a product state with N = 1, 2, ..., N unphysical contributions,\nZ\u0304 = tr(e\u2212\u03b2H\u0304\u2212\u03b2H\u0304 \u03c61,2 PF ) = Z + N\u2211 N=1 \u2211 \u03beN (Z\u03beN \u220f j\u2208\u03beN F \u03c61,2 j ).\n(7)\nHere, \u03beN counts different configurations of sites with unphysical spin and Z\u03beN is the physical partition function of the subsystem with the N unphysical sites removed. Since H\u0304 acts trivially on unphysical states, we can compute the local trace F\u03c61,2j over the unphysical states at site j explicitly,\nF \u03c61,2 j = \u30080|j e\u2212\u03b2H\u0304 \u03c61,2 PF |0\u3009j + \u3008\u2191\u2193|j e\u2212\u03b2H\u0304 \u03c61,2 PF |\u2191\u2193\u3009j (8)\n= ei\u03c61 + ei\u03c62 = 0 (9)\nand Eq. (7) yields Z\u0304 = Z. A similar analytic argument shows the faithfulness of spin correlation functions computed using the pf representation with the PF term (6), in particular Ci(T ) = 1 for all temperatures.\nIn the rest of the paper, we make the choice \u03c61 = \u2212\u03c62 = \u03c02 . This reduces Eq. (6) to Eq. (2), taking the simple non-interacting form of a potential which is, however, imaginary.\nWe emphasize that the PF trick applies also in the limit T \u2192 0 as easily seen from the fact that in the partition function (for which the PF term is rigorously defined) the Hamiltonian is multiplied by \u03b2 = 1/T and the PF contribution amounts to phase factors independent of T .\n4"

We refer to App. A for the choice of cutoff function and the flow equations which do not differ from the standard pf-fRG case. We use discrete Matsubara grids for all frequency arguments with about Nw = 30 (positive) frequencies and ensure that our results are converged in Nw. The ppf-fRG flows are smooth in \u039b with features appearing around \u039b \u223c J and a plateau towards \u039b \u2192 0 from which we obtain the end-of-flow results reported in the following.

In summary, the main difference between the ppf-fRG and the pf-fRG is the slightly reduced symmetry of the vertex functions discussed in the previous subsection, the finite initial condition for the self energy and fRG flows that are smooth and convergent."

Applications include the Anderson impurity model [46] and the two-dimensional Hubbard model [47, 48]. By construction, vertices obtained with mfRG in the limit of infinite loops converge to solutions of the parquet approximation (PA), a complementary diagrammatic formulation of the many-body problem in which the self-energy and frequency-dependent contributions to the two-particle vertex are self-consistently described by the Schwinger-Dyson and three Bethe-Salpeter equations, respectively. In-depth discussions of their structure for pseudo-fermion Hamiltonians can, for example, be found in Refs. [25, 26]. In contrast to the full parquet equations, the PA neglects frequency dependent contributions to the fully two-particle irreducible vertex I2PI which thus reduces to the bare vertex \u03930, with \u03930 \u223c J for pf systems. Deviations from exact vertices set in at fourth order in J/T , corresponding to the so-called envelope diagram.\nUsing the very same initial conditions as in the \u039b\u2192\u221e limit of ppf-fRG (27)\u2013(29), we numerically converge the algebraic equations of the PA using forward iterations combined with a mixed update scheme, which determines the input for the next iteration as\nxnew = (1\u2212 \u03bb)xold + \u03bbf(xold) , (30)\nwhere x = (\u03a3,\u0393) and f schematically denotes the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations.

For lower temperatures \u03bb had to be reduced from unity in order to obtain converged results. We choose extended Matsubara grids with up to 48\u00d7242 frequencies in mixed\nbosonic-fermionic frequency notation to parameterize the two-particle vertex as well as 32 frequencies for the selfenergy. For the vertex, we take into account the decomposition of each channel into its respective asymptotic functions K1, K2 (K\u03042) and R as detailed in Ref. [49]. We checked convergence with respect to the number of frequencies and, in most cases (see App. C and D), found no significant changes of our results if more were included."

Exact ED results of the spin Hamiltonian are shown as solid black lines in Fig. 2, see Ref. [41] for closed-form expressions. The (end-of-flow) ppf-fRG results are denoted by orange symbols. For large and moderate temperatures T & 0.4J , the exact susceptibilities are accurately reproduced by the ppf-fRG. For lower T , the susceptibilities become unphysically large in magnitude. This breakdown of accuracy is also reflected in Ci which considerably drops below unity with decreasing T .\nThe inaccuracies at low T are due to the truncation of the ppf-fRG flow equations so that self-energy and (twoparticle) vertex are only correct up to order J2/T , see App. C for numerical confirmation. However, the advantage of fRG over naive second-order perturbation theory (SOPT, dotted line in Fig. 2) is the re-summation of certain diagrams to infinite order [16], which is essential for the detection of magnetic ordering tendencies (see below). In the dimer case, the re-summation stabilizes the susceptibilities beyond temperatures where SOPT is applicable.\nAs the treatment of the full three-particle vertex is prohibitively expensive, an interesting question is if the above truncation problem can be alleviated by invoking higher-loop orders beyond the Katanin truncation. This has been shown to be numerically feasible in the pf-fRG [25, 26]. In fact, as explained in Sec. IV, our finite-temperature application makes it even possible to converge the ppf-PA equations equivalent to the loopconverged multi-loop result with an error of order J4/T 3 and J5/T 4 for vertex and self-energy, respectively. Surprisingly, our ppf-PA results (green symbols in Fig. 2) show no systematic improvement compared to the ppffRG. This unexpected finding also questions the usefulness of multi-loop extensions in the context of pf applications.\nFor completeness, blue symbols in Fig. 2 show results of the standard one-loop pf-fRG applied to H\u0304 (without PF potential H\u0304PF) which at large T compare well with the exact (but unphysical) ED results obtained from H\u0304\n7 T \u22120.5 0.0 0.5 J \u03c7 ij ED H ED H\u0304 SOPT \u03c700 \u03c701\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\nT/J\n0.5 0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nC i( T\n)\nppf-fRG ppf-PA\npf-fRG pm-fRG\nFigure 2.

Like in the ppf-fRG, agreement only holds for T & 0.4J , suggesting the truncation error in the fRG flow equations is largely independent of H\u0304PF.\nFinally, in Fig. 3 we consider the Heisenberg trimer, Eq. (3), where the ppf-fRG and ppf-PA results are qualitatively similar to the dimer and strengthen the conclusions given above for the latter case. It is interesting to note, that, presumably due to the truncation of the flow equations, the ppf-fRG and pf-fRG converge to the same result for low T even though the ground state of the pf trimer is not in the physical Hilbert space."

In App. D, we further investigate the truncation dependence of these quantities considering analogous simulations using the ppf-fRG without Katanin truncation and in the random phase approximation (RPA) where both C(T ) and Tc are overestimated and the critical exponent is consistent with the mean-field value \u03bd = 0.5.

This challenges the existing approach in the pf-fRG literature, which omits the projection and focuses on zero temperature. We have leveraged the pf-fRG to include the PF projection in potential form which requires only minor technical modifications and therefore can be readily adopted to existing variants of the method.

We note that a detailed understanding for the surprisingly poor performance of the latter is lacking at this point. For forthcoming applications, we suggest that the deviation of the spin projection Ci(T ) from the exact value of unity by 10% or more signals the quantitative failure of the ppf-fRG.\nThis failure of the (p)pf-fRG at low and zero temperature also questions an earlier proposal to remove unphysical contributions of the pf representation in the context of the pf-fRG at T = 0. The idea rests on the addition of an on-site term \u2212J0 \u2211 \u00b5=x,y,z S\u0304 \u00b5 i S\u0304 \u00b5 i [23] with J0 > 0 penalizing the S = 0 sector energetically versus the S = 1/2 sector.

However, due to the unavoidable approximations in the diagrammatic methods at hand, results obtained from the on-site term [23, 24] should be considered with appropriate care.\nFor infinite systems in three dimensions, we have demonstrated that it is possible to robustly detect magnetic ordering by finite-size scaling of the ppf-fRG data. This establishes an alternative to the less physical and implementation dependent concepts of flow-divergence or flow-breakdown at cutoff scale \u039b? which, by mean-field arguments, can be related to Tc [19, 22, 24]. However, although the correct type of N\u00e9el order has been predicted by the ppf-fRG for the nearest-neighbor AFM Heisenberg model on the cubic lattice, it remains unclear why the transition appears at a critical temperature more than 30% below benchmark results. A possible hint might be the spin projection Ci(T = T fRGc ) ' 0.88 which is out of the range identified as reliable above.\nFinally, there exist two alternatives to the PF projec-\n9 tion scheme that we would like to mention. First, in a field theory framework, a functional delta-function representation can be used to constrain the pf operators to the physical subspace. This then leads to the notion of a bosonic gauge field which plays an important role in the (mean-field) theory of spin liquids [5]. On the computational side, however, the introduction of such a bosonic field would require a multitude of additional vertex functions [12], a formidable challenge yet to be faced. Second, it is well known that a faithful quantum spin S = 1/2 representation exists in terms of Majorana fermions [57, 58]. The associated pseudo-Majorana fRG (pm-fRG) has been developed only recently [41]. The data from pm-fRG applied to the benchmark clusters treated in Sec. VA are shown by the gray lines in Fig. 2 (dimer) and Fig. 3 (trimer). The pm-fRG results are very similar to those of the ppf-fRG, with the same difficulties at small T . However, for the detection of the magnetic phase transition in the cubic lattice case, the pm-fRG determines Tc much more accurately only 5% below the exact result [53]."

[16, 59] do not rely on the vertex symmetries that are broken by the PF potential term (2), see the discussion in Sec. IV. Here, we write these flow equations for the Heisenberg case where the vertices are parameterized in a density and spin part, \u0393s and \u0393d, see Sec. IVC. The cutoff dependent propagator is defined as G\u039bj (\u03c9) = \u2212ig\u039bj (\u03c9) = \u03b8 \u039b(\u03c9) i\u03c9+i\u03b8\u039b(\u03c9)\u03b3j(\u03c9)\nwhere \u03a3j(\u03c9) = \u2212i\u03b3j(\u03c9) and we chose the regulator to be Lorentzian \u03b8\u039b(\u03c9) = \u03c9 2\n\u03c92+\u039b2 .

In the one-loop truncation, diagrams of order J 3\nT 2 and higher are neglected when calculating self energy or vertex. Therefore, the difference of the ED solution with the fRG solution should scale with J3 T 2 . This behavior can be seen in Fig. 6(a) for the self-energy of the Heisenberg dimer. For small temperatures, when J T becomes large, the scaling breaks down. In the ppf-PA, diagrams of order J5\nT 4 are neglected for the self energy. Compared to one-loop, this error scaling in ppf-PA is challenging to observe and can only be seen for very large frequency grids and at high temperatures, see Fig. 6(b).\nAppendix D: Finite temperature phase transitions for other truncation schemes\nIn Sec. VB the ppf-fRG was applied to asess the magnetic phase transition in the cubic lattice AFM Heisenberg model. Here, we additionally investigate the ppf-fRG without Katanin truncation, the RPA [10, 16], and the ppf-PA as further benchmark. The numerical RPA calculation is implemented using the ppf-fRG with Katanin truncation but a restriction to the terms including a site-sum \u2211 j on the right-hand side of Eqns. (A1), (A2) and (A5). The RPA confirms that the implementation of the PF term can reproduce the analytic spin mean-field result Tc = 1.5 and \u03bd = 0.5 for Heisenberg spins, see Fig. 7 (a), (c). The one-loop scheme without Katanin truncation yields Tc = 1.29 as well as a critical exponent consistent with the mean-field result \u03bd = 0.5, see Fig 7 (b), (d). In both the RPA and the one-loop truncation without Katanin, the spin projection exceeds unity.\nWe finally consider the ppf-PA formalism. As can be seen in the upper panel of Fig. 8, we indeed find a smearedout line crossing for \u03be/L, with the three largest system sizes crossing at Tc ' 0.855. However, the corresponding N\u00e9el susceptibilities (see the middle panel in Fig. 8) are substantially smaller than those obtained in ppf-fRG and a proper scaling collapse can be found neither for \u03bd = 0.5 nor \u03bd = 0.71. On the numerical side, we find that the rate of convergence drops considerably for T/J . 1.0 and the results, including the location of the intersection point of the \u03be-scaling, become highly sensitive to numerical details such as the specific choice of mixing factors and solution algorithm. This could indicate that the ppf-PA fixed points in vicinity of the critical regime are strongly repulsive and hard to access in numerical calculations. In conclusion, for the assessment of magnetic phase transition the ppf-PA seems less reliable and consistent than the one-loop ppf-fRG scheme.\n12\n13\n[1] A.
