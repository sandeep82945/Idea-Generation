The plate scale of the camera is 1.01 arcseconds pixel 1 and has a 7.4 degree \u21e5 7.4 degree field of view (Bellm et al. 2019a; Graham et al. 2019; Dekany et al. 2020). The data processing pipeline produced images di erenced from reference frames and removes or masks most detector artefacts. Transients are extracted from the images and several algorithms are used to identify slower moving objects that appear as round point spread function detections in the images (Masci et al. 2019).

The camera has a spatial scale of 0.26 arcseconds pixel 1 and a 4.4 arcminute \u21e5 4.4 arcminute field of view. The camera is capable of reading out at a rate of 1 Hz and of individual exposures times up to 10 s. Our observations used 10 s exposures in r-band and were sidereally tracked due to the short exposure time. Seeing conditions were \u21e01 arcsec as measured for background stars in the follow-up images. Keck I Telescope: The Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) (Oke et al. 1995) on the Keck I telescope was used to observe Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim on 2020 January 23 in spectroscopy mode (Program ID C272, PI M. Graham). The blue camera consists of two 2k \u21e5 4k Marconi CCD arrays and the red camera consists of two science grade Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 2k \u21e5 4k CCD arrays. Both cameras have a spatial resolution of 0.135 arcsec pixel 1. The 1.0-arcsecond wide slit was used with the 560 nm dichroic with \u21e050% transmission e ciency in combination with the 600/4000 grating for the blue camera and the 400/8500 grating for the red camera providing a spectral resolution of 0.4 nm and 0.7 nm, respectively (Oke et al. 1995; McCarthy et al. 1998). A total exposure time of 600 s over two integrations were taken in seeing conditions of \u21e00.6 arcseconds measured at zenith, however, the observations were taken at the large airmass of \u21e03.4 resulting in degrading the seeing to \u21e01.2 arcsec. Wavelength calibration used HgCdZn lamps for the blue camera and the ArNeXe lamps for the red camera. Flux calibration used the G191-B2B and Feige 34 standard stars for the blue and red camera respectively and a solar analog star 2MASS 22462446+0029244 was used for slope correction. The data of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim and the standard stars were obtained from the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA). Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope: Observations of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim were conducted with the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) on 2021 July 17 Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph in imaging mode (Clemens et al. 2004). Data were taken in the SDSS r filter, and the telescope was tracked non-sidereally at the asteroid\u2019s sky motion rate using 30 s exposures. The seeing during the observations was \u21e01 arcsecond and the airmass of the observations was \u21e03.3.

Two dimensional histograms are shown for each pair of combinations of Tp , e, q, Q, a, i, M , ! and \u2326 for the orbital samples. Individual samples are plotted as tiny grey dots.

Non-sidereal tracking rates at the asteroid\u2019s sky motion rate were used and data were taken in the broadband J filter in 4-9 s exposures using a four point dither pattern. The seeing during the observations was \u21e01 arcsecond and the airmass of the observations was \u21e02.4.\nA1.2 Visual imaging/spectroscopy reduction and astrometry\nThe Gaia data release 2 catalog (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018) was used with the ZTF data reduction pipeline (Masci et al. 2019) to produce an astrometric solution on ZTF data with the software4. Photometric calibration was performed using the Pan-STARRS1 catalog database (Tonry et al. 2012). The LRIS spectroscopic data were reduced using flat field, dark current and arc lamp exposures with the spectroscopy reduction software (Perley 2019).\n4 http://www.astrometrica.at/\nA1.3 Orbit determination and dynamical integration\nWe used the N-body orbit integration package (Rein & Liu 2012) using the IAS15 adaptive time step integrator (Rein & Spiegel 2015) to determine the orbital history of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim. We generated 222 clone orbits of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim using the multi-variate distribution of the orbital parameters presented in Table A1 and Fig. A2, determined with observations taken between 2020 January 4 and 2020 November 26 with the _ orbital integration package 5. We integrated the Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim orbital clones forwards and backward 30 Myrs using barycentric coordinates with a nominal timestep of 14 h. As an adaptive time-step integrator, IAS15 decreases the time step during close encounters. We find that Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim has experienced numerous, \u21e00.01 au close encounters with Mercury and Venus that are as frequent as every few hundred to thousands of years due to it evolving on to planet-crossing orbits as seen for one example orbit clone of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim in Fig. 4C. We ignore the Yarkovsky e ect in our orbital integrations because the e ect of perturbations during planetary encounters on the orbital evolution of planet-crossing asteroids in the terrestrial planet zone dominates the Yarkovsky e ect on the time scales of our orbital integrations (Bottke et al. 2002b, 2006; Granvik et al. 2018)."

            "text": "One of the main sources of uncertainty on the\u21e01.7\u00b10.6 km diameter estimate of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim is the 1- uncertainty on H of \u21e00.8 magnitudes from JPL HORIZONS. We note that this uncertainty on the H of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim is greater than the \u21e00.3 magnitudes scatter on H of asteroids from the Minor Planet Center catalog (Vere\u00f6 et al. 2015). The large uncertainty on H may be related to the unknown phase function (Jedicke et al. 2016). We obtain a slightly lower diameter for Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim of \u21e01.4-1.6 km using albedos (in the range 0.23-0.3) measured for S-types in the general near-Earth Object (NEO)/near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population (Thomas et al. 2011). The NEA albedo model (Morbidelli et al. 2020) predicts that \u21e0 60% of km-scale inner-Venus objects should have albedos exceeding 0.2 as seen in Fig. A3. Combining the spread in albedos of S-type asteroids (Thomas et al. 2011) with our estimate of the albedo of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim and the \u21e00.8 magnitudes uncertainty on H, we estimate a diameter range for Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim of \u21e01.7\u00b10.6 km.\nThe calculation of the absolute magnitude of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim was made assuming a phase parameter of 0.15. The assumed value of 0.15 is the average asteroid phase parameter determined by photometric observations of a large ensemble of asteroids regardless of spectral class (Oszkiewicz et al. 2012; Vere\u00f6 et al. 2015). Our spectrum and the spectrum reported by others of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim (Popescu et al. 2020) constrains the taxonomy of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim to be likely S-type (Fig. 5). Therefore, it might be appropriate to assume a higher phase parameter of \u21e00.2 found for S-types (Pravec et al. 2012; Vere\u00f6 et al. 2015) which would increase the nominal absolute magnitude of Ayl\u00f3 chaxnim by \u21e00.1 magnitudes, smaller than the \u21e00.8 absolute magnitude uncertainty.\nThe scatter in phase parameters determined for asteroids within the S-types taxonomic class is \u21e00.1-0.2 when measured over a large ensemble of asteroids (Warner et al. 2009; Vere\u00f6 et al. 2015), and"
