    "abstractText": "The present study proposed the synthesis of a novel acridine derivative not yet described in the literature, chemical characterization by NMR, MS, and IR, followed by investigations of its antileishmanial potential. In vitro assays were performed to assess its antileishmanial activity against L. amazonensis strains and cytotoxicity against macrophages through MTT assay and annexin V-FITC/PI, and the ability to perform an immunomodulatory action using CBA. To investigate possible molecular targets, its interaction with DNA in vitro and in silico targets were evaluated. As results, the compound showed good antileishmanial activity, with IC50 of 6.57 (amastigotes) and 94.97 (promastigotes) \u03bcg mL\u22121, associated with non-cytotoxicity to macrophages (CC50 > 256.00 \u03bcg mL\u22121). When assessed by flow cytometry, 99.8% of macrophages remained viable. The compound induced an antileishmanial effect in infected macrophages and altered TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and IL-6 expression, suggesting a slight immunomodulatory activity. DNA assay showed an interaction with the minor grooves due to the hyperchromic effect of 47.53% and Kb 1.17 \u00d7 106 M\u22121, and was sustained by docking studies. Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA calculations propose cysteine protease B as a possible target. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the new compound is a promising molecule and contributes as a model for future works.",

            "text": "Leishmaniasis is a parasitosis caused by macrophage infection of protozoa from the genus Leishmania, transmitted to mammal host through the bite of blood-feeding females of phlebotomine sand flies [1]. It has been recognized as one of the main neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) of global health concern, estimating that over one billion people are living in endemic areas at risk of infection. Accordingly, each year more than two million new cases occur, associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality [2,3]. Leishmania parasites exist in two forms during their life cycle (amastigotes and promastigotes) and are capable of manifesting three main clinical forms, generally classified as cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL, also known as kala-azar). Depending on the parasite species and the cellular immune mechanisms of the host, different clinical, histopathological and immunopathological manifestations are developed [4,5]. The immune mechanism response of the host to the infection relies on myeloid cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, which develops a complex relation [6]. Leishmania protozoa use macrophages as important host cells for establishing the infection. In order to adapt, the parasite regulates phagosome maturation, promoting the alteration of macrophage defenses such as oxidative damage, antigen presentation, immune activation and apoptosis, while there is an increase in nutrient availability, causing the macrophage to become a favorable environment for its growth and avoiding destruction [7]. Current chemotherapy includes drugs such as sodium stibogluconate, meglumine antimoniate, amphotericin B, paromomycin, and pentamidine. These, however, have limitations regarding the emergence of resistant strains, high costs, prolonged administration, and the manifestation of side-effects such as nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and hepatotoxicity [8,9]. In this sense, the development of new candidates for leishmanicidal drugs that are more effective against parasites, associated with less toxicity to the human host, stands out as a priority. In this sense, the acridine nucleus has demonstrated to be an eligible scaffold due to its potential as a chemotherapeutic precursor [10]. As an antiparasitic acridine compound of clinical application, mepacrine stands out due to its wide spectrum of biological action, with its main application in the treatment of malaria in chloroquine-resistant strains. Therefore, several studies aimed at obtaining leishmanicidal compounds are based on the chemical structure of this compound, maintaining the 9-amino-2-methoxy-6-chloroacridine core while altering moieties linked to the 9-amino groups [11], as observed in the study developed by Serafim et al. [12], in which the authors have synthesized and evaluated the antipromastigote activity of thiophene-acridine derivatives against L. (L.) amazonensis strains, highlighting compounds ACS01 and ACS02 as potent and selective, with IC50 values of 9.60 and 10.95 \u00b5M against antimony-sensitive strains, and 14.83 and 16.36 \u00b5M against resistant strains, respectively. Furthermore, both molecules interacted with DNA with binding constants of 104 M\u22121, in which the activity is attributed to the 6-chloro-2methoxy-acridine moiety, as also previously reported by Zhang et al. [13]. Based on these previous data, our group proposed the synthesis of a novel acridine derivative containing the 6-chloro-2-methoxy-acridine moiety, through a rational strategy of molecular design based on a privileged structure, linked to a triazolidine-dithione nucleus obtained through an intramolecular spontaneous cyclization, followed by in silico and in vitro evaluation of its antileishmanial activity, mechanism of action through DNA interaction and immunomodulatory properties."

The cellular immunity generated by the Th1 is considered to be the key mediator of resistance to Leishmania, as they are associated with the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2) that activate the M\u03a6 killing machinery, leading to parasite inactivation [16\u201318]. Nevertheless, according to the results obtained in our experiments, there is a significant decrease in the expression of TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 3a) with the addition of the acridine compound ACW-02, at the lowest up until the highest concentration evaluated, thus favoring an anti-inflammatory action. Further, the effect of the compound on IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 cytokines was not significant. On the other hand, cytokines expressed by Th2 cells (e.g., IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) are related to an anti-inflammatory action, as they are capable of suppressing the host\u2019s immune system, causing macrophage depletion and, consequently, promoting development of the intracellular forms of the parasite and disease progression [17]. According to our findings, a decrease in IL-10 expression is observed (Figure 3d), approaching basal values at the lowest concentration tested (2 \u00b5g mL\u22121). Moreover, there is a significant decrease in IL-6 expression at all concentrations evaluated. Opposed to the previous results, the decrease in the expression of an anti-inflammatory interleukin will favor a pro-inflammatory effect, that is, a leishmanicidal action. Results found for the other evaluated cytokine, IL-4, were not significant. Lastly, Th17 is involved in the production of IL-17, a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine with significant effects on stromal cells, resulting in the recruitment of leukocytes and forming an interaction between innate and adaptive immunity [16,19]. However, according to the results obtained, the compound ACW-02 does not show significant activity on the cytokine IL-17A (Figure 3g)."

            "text": "The compound under study is an unprecedented triazolidine-acridine derivative. The initial design of the compound contemplated the coupling reaction between the disubstituted acridine nucleus and the intermediate N-phenylhydrazine-carbothioamide, a thiosemicarbazide derivative, selected during the design stage due to the inherent potential of the fragment that gives it a broad spectrum of biological activity [43,44], including antiprotozoal action [45\u201347]. However, during the synthesis stage, the triazolidine-dithione nucleus was obtained through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between the carbothioamide intermediate and the acridine nucleus, followed by an intramolecular attack favored by the energy provided by the heating of the reaction and by the free protons in the reaction medium, inducing an autocyclization and a fragmentation of the aniline portion from the carbothioamide subunit, forming a new triazolidine-thione nucleus coupled to the substituted acridine. Thus, due to the novelty of the compound, it was decided to continue the studies by observing the contributions of this new ring to the acridine scaffold. The reaction to obtain the final product occurred in an ethanolic and acidic medium, at reflux temperature, and was finalized by cooling the reaction to room temperature, followed by the addition of distilled water and precipitation of the product, subsequently filtrated. Ultimately, ACW-02 was elucidated by 1H and 13C NMR, infrared, and mass spectrometry techniques, showing signs that confirmed the proposed structure. Therefore, given the potential of acridine compounds as chemotherapeutic agents, with several studies exploring and reporting their anticancer anticancer [13,48\u201351], antibacterial [52\u201354] and antiparasitic [12,55,56] properties, this study aimed to evaluate the potential antileishmanial activity of the new synthetically obtained compound, given the urgent need for efficient drugs for this purpose. Leishmaniasis comprises the pathology caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. In its digenetic life cycle, the parasite assumes metacyclic promastigote and amastigote forms in the vertebrate host. The promastigote forms are initially inoculated into the host through the bite of the sandfly mosquito and, in the bloodstream, the parasites penetrate phagocytic cells through interactions between their surface molecules and macrophage receptors. In the phagocytic vacuole, these differentiate into the amastigote form and multiply intensely until the infected macrophage ruptures. These free amastigotes, in turn, infect other macrophages and continue the cycle [4,57]. Therefore, depending on the drug\u2019s affinity for each parasitic form, different stages of the infection progression will be achieved. According to the studies carried out, the compound ACW-02 presented an IC50 value of 6.57 \u00b5g mL\u22121 against amastigote forms of L. amazonensis, and 94.97 \u00b5g mL\u22121 against promastigote forms of the same species.\nDepending on the infecting species, different clinical manifestations may develop. The species under study, Leishmania amazonensis, is an important etiological agent that causes American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) and is capable of establishing a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, varying from: cutaneous, localized or diffuse, which are the most common; mucocutaneous; and even visceral leishmaniasis [58]. Thus, it is observed that the amastigote forms are more sensitive to the pharmacological action of ACW-02 than the promastigote forms, indicating the possible potentiality of the compound against these forms of L. amazonensis in the treatment of ACL. Moreover, based on the report by Serafim et al. [12], the hybridization of the thiophene portion with the 6,9-dichloro-2-methoxy-acridine ring was beneficial to the evaluated antipromastigote activity against L. amazonensis, obtaining IC50 values between 9.62 and 69.11 \u00b5M. However, the hybridization of the non-substituted acridine ring to the thiophene portion caused a loss in activity, highlighting then the relevance of the substitution in the acridine ring by groups with positive mesomeric effect (\u2013OCH3 and \u2013Cl) for antileishmanial activity. As this study involves obtaining an unprecedented molecule that possesses the substituted acridine nucleus, the same as that used by Serafim et al. [12], it is supposed that this portion of the molecular structure of ACW-02 is associated with the antileishmanial activity presented. Considering the importance of macrophages during the installation and progression of the Leishmania infectious process [59], studies involving the effects of ACW-02 on J774 macrophages were carried out. The determination of CC50 demonstrates that the compound did not show cytotoxicity up to the highest concentration tested (256.00 \u00b5g mL\u22121), and this result is confirmed in more detail through the evaluation of cytotoxicity in macrophages by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay, which showed low percentages of cells (<2%) in initial, late apoptosis and necrosis after treatment with ACW-02 at concentrations of 1, 16, and 32 \u00b5g mL\u22121. Thus, evaluating the first result mentioned, the calculated selectivity index of ACW-02 to L. amazonensis amastigote cells was above 38.94, providing a safety margin. Additionally, a stimulatory effect on macrophages was observed at a concentration of 9.46 \u00b5g mL\u22121 in preliminary studies and the possibility of the compound\u2019s ability to play an immunomodulatory effect on macrophages was evaluated in more comprehensive studies. The determination of the microbicidal effect contributed to the supposed possibility of altering the functionality of the macrophage in the face of parasitic infection with the addition of the ACW-02 compound, due to the alteration in the parameters that evaluate the percentage of infected cells, the average of Leishmanias and percentage of infection, especially in lower concentrations (1 and 16 \u00b5g mL\u22121) and, accordingly, closer to the EC50 value obtained. Moreover, it is supposed that the highest concentration (32 \u00b5g mL\u22121) may have caused a supersaturation on the culture medium during the test, thus causing a modification in the solubility of the compound and consequent decrease in biological activity, due to the lower interaction of the compound with the infected macrophages. To determine the influence of the compound directly on the components of the immune system, targeted studies were carried out. The control of the infection and disease progression caused by Leishmania sp. is associated with the generation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses. Stimulation of a Th1 response and the downmodulation of a Th2 response promotes macrophage activation and, consequently, assists in the host control of Leishmania parasite burden and clinical cure [18,60]. The results obtained in response to Th2 demonstrated a significant decrease in the expression of IL-10 and IL-6 cytokines, thus contributing to an antileishmanial effect. These results corroborate with the aforementioned studies and may justify the macrophage\u2019s ability to perform a microbicidal effect against Leishmania. However, these results are not sufficiently conclusive, since there is also a significant decrease in TNF-\u03b1 expression, which, on the other hand, exerts a pro-leishmania effect. Thus, the effect accomplished by reducing TNF-\u03b1 is antagonistic to the one obtained by decreasing IL-10 and IL-6. Similarly, macrophage activation promotes the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to induce oxidative damage to the parasite [20]. However, the results did\nnot demonstrate an alteration in these components that would justify the performance of an immunomodulatory activity by ACW-02 at the concentrations evaluated (2\u20138 \u00b5g mL\u22121). Thus, due to the lack of results that establish the immunomodulatory effect as justification for the entirety of the antileishmanial activity, other pharmacological targets were evaluated in silico and in vitro. The acridine nucleus, present in the structure of the compound ACW-02, stands out as a potential scaffold. Its biological activity can be attributed to the planarity of its aromatic structures, which can interact by intercalation or interactions with the DNA grooves alone, interfering in cellular properties [61\u201363]. In view of this potential mechanism of action of acridine compounds, the interaction of the compound ACW-02 with DNA was evaluated. The presence of aromatic groups without substituents may favor the interaction of the complex through strong hydrophobic or non-covalent interactions between the electron states of the chromophore and DNA base pairs, leading to a decrease in the transition energy \u03c0\u2192 \u03c0*. However, despite the acridine ring possible interactions, the hyperchromic effect observed in this compound may be due to the additional electrostatic interactions of the methoxyl (\u2013OCH3), of the acridine ring, which has \u03c3+ and \u03c0- effects, and of the chlorine atom (\u2013Cl), which has \u03c3+ and \u03c0+ effects, resulting in a reduction of the stacking of bases of this biomolecule [64\u201366]. In general, the non-substituted acridine nucleus presents intercalating activity [67,68] through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with DNA base pairs. The insertion of the triazolidine nucleus, presenting electron acceptor groups (C=S) and electron donors/acceptors (\u2013NH), may favor the stabilization of the supramolecular DNA-ligand complex, through electrostatic or non-covalent interactions [69\u201371]. Thus, favoring a possible intercalation and interaction with DNA grooves. In silico molecular docking studies were used as a strategy to reaffirm the interaction with DNA through studies on the ellipticine-complexed DNA target (PDB ID: 1Z3F), demonstrating an ACW-02 score proximate to that of the ellipticine standard (71.77 and 75.68, respectively). Aiming to elucidate possible molecular mechanisms that could contribute to the entirety of the antileishmanial action of the compound ACW-02 and justify its selectivity for the parasite, theoretical studies of molecular docking were performed in pharmacological targets exclusive and essential to the Leishmania (TryR, Topo I, CPBLa, and CYP51). The results demonstrated the in silico affinity of the compound to the targets and interactions with essential amino acid residues capable of propagating a tissue response. In view of these findings, important interactions of the compound ACW-02 are observed, especially against the topoisomerase I target, in which the compound presented a score value comparable to the control compound Camptothecin (60.34 and 63.98, respectively). This enzyme is responsible for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA that occurs during DNA replication and transcription processes, and its blockage can lead to cell death [72]. Therefore, topoisomerase I is a promising target for antileishmanial compounds since the enzyme is overpressed during Leishmania\u2019s rapid life cycle and is structurally distinct from the human topoisomerase I [37]. On the other hand, ACW-02 reveled the best interaction against the CPBLa by molecular docking (fit score of 50.97 and 47.77 for the standard) and interactions with key residues (Cys153, His289, and Gly151). Similar to other cysteine protease inhibitors [73], the interactions with key residues are related to inhibiting the enzyme\u2019s catalytic functions and preventing the parasite\u2019s life cycle [74,75]. In addition, the best stability in MD simulations and great \u2206Gbind through MM-PBSA calculations (\u2212103.13 KJ/mol) propose the CPBLa as a possible drug target. Others works highlight these methods as essential to predict drug targets of leishmaniasis [76,77]. Furthermore, these findings are in agreement with other works that underline the acridine derivatives as promising cysteine protease inhibitors [78]. Moreover, these findings corroborate with in silico and in vitro results of interaction with DNA, suggesting the possibility of the compound performing a dual pharmacological\nactivity, that is, being able to intercalate with DNA bases and inhibit the activity of the Leishmania topoisomerase I enzyme and CPBLa. Therefore, further studies that support in the mechanistic elucidation that can justify the leishmanicidal effect of the compound, whether in silico, in vitro, or in vivo, are envisioned by our research group, especially aiming to clarify its activity against topoisomerase I and CPBLa from Leishmania, as well as the expansion of the chemical series to obtain new derivatives that may present more favorable results."

In a 96-well-plate, the compound was diluted in the following concentrations: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 \u00b5g mL\u22121. In parallel, 2.0\u00d7 105 axenic amastigotes and 1.0\u00d7 105 JJ74 macrophages were distributed per well, according to the assay in question. The plates were incubated for 24 h and 2 h, respectively, at 37 \u25e6C with 5% CO2. Then, 10 \u00b5L of MTT was added per well and the cultures were re-incubated for a period of 4 h.

Culture growth was observed after 72 h of incubation at 25 \u25e6C by counting viable cells using a Neubauer chamber, and calculated using the following Equation (1):\nNo. Leishmania/mL = No. of cells counted \u00d7 No. of Neubauer chamber quadrants \u00d7 the dilution used \u00d7 104 (Neubauer chamber correction factor) (1)\nThe concentration that inhibits 50% of parasite growth (IC50) was the parameter used to estimate growth inhibition. Therefore, IC50 was determined after 72 h of cultivation by linear regression analysis with SPSS 8.0 software for Windows. Each test was performed in 2 independent experiments, with different cultures, and in technical triplicate.\n4.2.4. Cytotoxicity Evaluation in Macrophages by Annexin V-FITC/PI Double Staining Assay\nThe cytotoxicity assay in JJ74 macrophages was performed the molecule through the method of Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay by flow cytometer BD LSRFortessaTM (BDBiosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). This assay is based on the ability of annexin V to bind to phosphatidylserine, which is externalized in apoptotic events, and propidium iodide to bind to the DNA of cells that have lost membrane integrity. Thus, this study allows the detection of viable cells (Annexin\u2013/PI\u2013), early apoptotic cells (Annexin+/PI\u2013), late apoptotic cells (Annexin+/PI+) and necrotic cells (Annexin\u2013/PI+) [83,84]. The analyses took place in 96-well plates, and 4 \u00d7 104 macrophages were distributed per well, with the addition of the molecule in concentrations of 1, 16 and 32 \u00b5g mL\u22121. These were incubated in DMEM (Gibco\u00ae, Billings, MT, USA) medium for two hours at 37 \u25e6C with 5% CO2. Subsequently, 2 \u00b5L of annexin + 2 \u00b5L PI was added to each well, followed by ten minutes of incubation. Lastly, the plates were centrifuged, with the removal of 100 \u00b5L of the supernatant and the addition of 200 \u00b5L of saline. Fluorescence-activated cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer. The analyses were performed in sextuplicate [85].\n4.2.5. Microbicidal Assay\nThe J774 macrophage cells were quantified and distributed (1.5\u00d7 105 cells/excavation) in 24 excavation-plates in DMEM medium, adding coverslips previously washed in each well to promote cell adhesion. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u25e6C with 5% CO2. Subsequent to the cell adhesion process, the excavations were washed with STF pH 7.2; 37 \u25e6C, followed by the addition of the amastigote forms of L. amazonensis (1.5 \u00d7 106/excavation). To promote macrophage infection, these were incubated for 12 h at 37 \u25e6C with 5% CO2, in DMEM medium added with 10% Bovine Fetal Serum (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). To remove the non-phagocyted Leishmanias, the excavations were washed three times with sterile FTS at 37 \u25e6C. The molecule was then incubated at the before-mentioned concentrations during a 2 h treatment period. Finally, the surplus medium was removed, the excavations were exposed to drying and fixed in methanol, being later stained with Giemsa 10% solution and evaluated by optical microscopy (1000\u00d7). The microbicidal effect was evaluated by determining infection in 200 macrophages, being expressed as a product of the mean of phagocyted Leishmanias by the percentage of infected macrophages. To determine the estimated percentage of macrophages adhered to the coverslips, the cells present in 10% of the coverslips were quantified with the assistance of optical microscopy (400\u00d7) [86].\n4.2.6. Assessment of Cytokine Production by Macrophages\nThe quantification of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, INF-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1was performed in the supernatant of cell cultures of J774 macrophages infected with L. amazonensis amastigotes, by cytometry bead array (CBA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Macrophages were adhered to a plate infected with L. amazonensis and treated with the compound under analysis at concentrations of 2, 4, and 8 \u00b5g mL\u22121. Uninfected and untreated macrophages were used as the negative control, while the untreated macrophages infected with L. amazonensis were used as the positive control. After the 24-h treatment period, 50 \u00b5L of the supernatant from each well was transferred to a conical tube, followed by the addition of 50 \u00b5L of the capture bead mixture and 50 \u00b5L of the detection reagent. A calibration curve containing the following concentrations of each cytokine was added to the experiment: 0 pg mL\u22121, 20 pg mL\u22121, 40 pg mL\u22121, 80 pg mL\u22121, 156 pg mL\u22121, 312.5 pg mL\u22121, 625 pg mL\u22121, 1250 pg mL\u22121, 2500 pg mL\u22121 and 5000 pg mL\u22121. The fluorescence intensity in each sample was captured on the BD LRS II FORTESSA flow cytometer using the DIVA program version 7 (BD Bioscience), and the fluorescence data were processed using the FCAP array program version 3 (BD Bioscience). The experiments were performed in triplicate [86].\n4.2.7. Evaluation of the Production of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species The quantification of ROS and RNS was performed using the probe 2\u2032,7\u2032- dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2\u2032,7\u2032difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM diacetate), which produce, in the presence of reactive species, 2-7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2\u2032,7\u2032difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM), respectively, which fluoresce and remain inside the cell. Macrophages were adhered to a plate infected with L. amazonensis and treated with the compound under analysis at concentrations of 2, 4, and 8 \u00b5g mL\u22121. Uninfected and untreated macrophages were used as the negative control, while the untreated macrophages infected with L. amazonensis were used as the positive control. After the 24-h treatment period, the plates were incubated for 30 min with the DCF-DA probe diluted in saline pH 7.2 and 1 h with the DAF-FM diacetate probe diluted in saline pH 7.2, respectively, in a humid chamber at 37 \u25e6C with 5% CO2, protected from light. Then, the cells were washed with saline, pH 7.2, at room temperature and resuspended with 200 \u00b5L of saline under the same conditions. The fluorescence intensity in each sample was captured on the BD LRS II FORTESSA flow cytometer using the DIVA program version 7 (BD Bioscience) and the\nmean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was obtained after processing the data in the FlowJoTM version 10.6.1. The experiment was performed in triplicate and the results were calculated as the difference in MFI in each group [86]."

Thus, the search revealed 100 homologous sequences, so the one with the best alignment was with the cruzain from T. cruzi (PDB: 1aim) [94], used as a template. Finally, the model was built using the Swiss-Model web software (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/, accessed on 10 September 2022) [95] and validated through the Ramachandran graph generated by the SAVES web software (https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/, accessed on 12 September 2022) [96].

At the same time, Ligand topologies were generated using the web software SwissParam (http://www.swissparam.ch/, accessed on 29 September 2022) [104].

Additionally, the compound appeared to perform immunomodulatory activity toward macrophages\u2019 infection management due to the down expression of the pro-Leishmania cytokines IL-10 and IL-6. Furthermore, evaluated in silico and in vitro, the compound ACW-02 presented the ability to bind with DNA, suggesting this as one of the potential targets responsible for the activity performed. Additional theoretical studies of molecular docking, dynamics and MM-PBSA calculations in Leishmania\ntargets contributed to a possible mechanistic elucidation and justification of the selectivity of the compound for the parasite cell by topoisomerase IB and CPBLa inhibition. Therefore, this preliminary study supports the potential antiparasitic action of this acridine compound, encouraging further studies involving this proposal.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph16020204/s1, Figure S1: 1H NMR spectrum of ACW-02 (500 MHz, DMSO-d6); Figure S2: 13C NMR spectrum of ACW-02 (125 MHz, DMSO-d6); Figure S3: Extended Mass spectrum of ACW-02 by MALDI-TOF; Figure S4: Infrared (IR) of ACW-02; Figure S5: Annexin V-FITC/PI assay with control group; Figure S6: Effect of compound ACW-02 on macrophages.
