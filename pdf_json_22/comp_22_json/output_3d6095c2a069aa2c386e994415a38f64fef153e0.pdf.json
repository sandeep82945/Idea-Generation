The chatbot aims to teach users how to use an educational system \u2013 Talis Aspire \u2013 effectively by giving them quick answers to questions, offering demonstrations and instructions on how to complete essential tasks on Talis Aspire, advising them how to solve problems and providing solutions for common issues. We have presented the prototype, together with the approach we used to design and develop it by considering the concepts of \u2018Recontextualisation\u2019 and \u2018Quality Function Deployment\u2019. We argue that the use of chatbot technology can not only help tutors develop online education and teaching materials but may also improve the quality of educational services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of recommendations and further work suggested by domain experts have also been highlighted in this paper in order to improve our prototype further.\nCCS CONCEPTS \u2022 Applied computing \u2022 Education \u2022 Computer-managed instruction\nAdditional Keywords and Phrases: AI Chatbot, AI in Education, Educational Service Improvement, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Talis Aspire, Post-Pandemic"

In the educational domain, it has become crucial to carefully listen to the voice of our staff and students and effectively respond to their changing needs and expectations. Chatbot technology has the potential to capture and prioritise our students\u2019 and our staff\u2019s changing needs.\nIn this paper, we have conducted a case study and developed an AI chatbot prototype to support teachers and\nstudents to develop digital reading lists via Talis Aspire. Based on the digital lists developed, students can then access the reading resources available in the library and on the Internet efficiently. The principles of Quality Function Deployment have been applied in focusing on capturing the key stakeholder needs and understanding whether the technology can be aligned to satisfy these needs."

            "text": "Recontextualisation is a process that extracts knowledge from its original context and reuses it in another context to bring added value to it [1, 2]. In the education domain, this means that knowledge can be extracted from\ntraditional contexts, such as textbooks and classrooms, to other digital contexts, such as web pages, instructional videos and blogs [3]. In this paper, a case study is presented. An AI chatbot is used as a new knowledge communication medium to communicate technical knowledge within the Talis system to develop digital reading lists from the perspective of recontextualisation. The key stakeholders that were identified for this phase of the evaluation were teaching staff, teaching support staff and students.\nThere are limitations to teaching people how to use educational applications effectively in traditional contexts (through textbooks and in classrooms), especially when users are under pressure and only have a limited amount of time. As in most cases, technical knowledge is represented by texts and diagrams. Learners might not be able to understand the concepts easily and may not be able to apply them in practice quickly. They may become bored easily because of the language, text fronts and colors used, or they may be exposed to a large amount of irrelevant information. Additionally, there are fewer interactions available during the knowledge communication process. The learning must take place within a fixed timeframe or at a fixed location \u2013 users cannot take control of their own learnings flexibly. The tutors and learning support team may not be able to respond to the enquires quickly enough if the learners are based in different time zones, especially during the Pandemic. AI chatbots have the potential to improve upon these limitations.\nThe AI chatbot, as a new knowledge communication media, has the potential to teach students and teachers in a way that is more interesting, engaging and flexible than traditional teaching methods [4]. A chatbot encourages them to take more control of their own learning. It aims to filter out unnecessary and irrelevant information to help users complete specific tasks. It also promotes communication and interactions between users and the university systems. The use of multimedia in the chatbot has the potential to help users engage with the content more effectively [5]. The other potential benefits will be discussed in later sections.\nIn a previous study to assess the potential for Virtual and Mixed Reality (VR and MR) to help enhance student\nengagement in engineering degree courses, a similar approach was taken where the modern Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methods were used to help capture, structure and prioritise needs and evaluate the alternative VR and MR technologies against these needs [6]."

They can be integrated into\nwebsites, software applications, messages and social networks. It is important to choose the most suitable bot development platform during the early stages.

We have also included use cases for beginners and experienced users (see Figure 4) FAQs are also considered. The chatbot provides details about issues and offers demos and instructions that tell users how to resolve common problems encountered when updating their lists.\nTo start with, sticky notes are a useful tool to develop the dialogue flows. We can move and rearrange the flows\neasily and endlessly on a wall or a whiteboard. There are also commercial software, such as BotMock [13], that allow team members to develop/refine the dialogue flows collaboratively and remotely.\nFigure 4: Different type of users"

We cannot export the usage data, we cannot customize the analysis approach and we cannot distinguish/prioritise the importance of each requirement, i.e. determining which are necessary and which are not. We cannot measure customer satisfaction level, i.e. how many users are happy and with what or how many users are unhappy and with what.

            "heading": "6 DISCUSSION WITH EXPERTS",
            "text": "We have discussed this prototype with industry partners and IT experts as well as educational specialists and have has several recommendations made for future work. These will be looked at in the following sub-sections.\n6.1 Service improvements The Talis Aspire reading list system is only one of the many educational applications commonly used in the UK. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more universities are moving their teaching online and, therefore, more educational systems are being introduced to support this than ever before; for example, MS Teams and Zoom are being used to support online lectures and seminars, and alternative assessment systems have been employed to support online examinations and assignments. Developing teachers\u2019, students\u2019 and university staff\u2019s digital capability has become more important. However, training and supporting teachers and students to make use of these new systems is a large task for most educational institutions. AI chatbot technology has the potential to take over some responsibilities, thus reducing staff workload and associated stress. It also has the potential to support the use of newly introduced popular educational systems other than Talis Aspire. Such technology can improve the quality of educational services by:\n Helping tutors to deliver online education or develop teaching materials.  Helping to capture and prioritise teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 changing needs when using educational\nsystems.\n Helping users of new educational applications identify where they can be improved.  Promoting active and autonomous learning in an online environment.  Promoting user-centred one-to-one interactions and consultations.  Providing flexible 24/7 online support across multiple time zones.  Promoting personalised learning pathways.  Reducing teachers\u2019 and support staff\u2019s workloads and reducing costs.\n6.2 AR and AI One aspect of our future work will include integrating the AI chatbot into our augmented reality (AR) learning environment in order to create richer and more comprehensive experiences for our learners and explore innovative teaching methods for our users. However, there are still several design and technical challenges to explore and overcome. This would include extending the QFD study on use of AR/ VR to engineering education, courses [6] to refine the Customer Voice Table, shown in Figure 6 below, to add specific needs for the Chatbot users as well as the AR/VR users.\nFigure 6: Customer / Stakeholder Voice Table for AR/VR Usage [6]\n6.3 Learning accessibility and inclusion Accessibility has become more and more important in recent times. \u2018Being inclusive is about giving equal access and opportunities to everyone wherever possible\u2019 [14]. Chatbot\u2019s built-in voice feature has the potential to support disabled users by improving accessibility and interaction, particularly by providing support for those users with reading or writing difficulties.\n6.4 User experiences Learning design is one of the key factors in creating a good learning experience. When we developed the chatbot, we were not only thinking about what a user does at each step but also considering what they are thinking and feeling. Another avenue for future work is evaluating this chatbot further by exploring what emotions have been generated while users are interacting with it.\n6.5 Adapt to changes The Talis Aspire system has been updated regularly every year, adding new features and improving the user interfaces (UI) over time. The AI chatbot, which supports the use of the Talis Aspire system, has to be updated regularly to mirror these improvements. This includes the videos and instructions, which need to be changed frequently. This places an additional workload on the maintenance and support teams. It should be noted that training people to maintain the chatbot and subscribing to the chatbot hosting platform costs money. It is worth considering the balance of costs and benefits for this as an investment, as well as making sure to choose the most appropriate educational applications and chatbot technology from which to obtain the most value."

            "heading": "7 Conclusions",

The potential educational, technical and management stakeholder benefits have been highlighted and discussed throughout the paper. It is recommended that the further use of\nmodern QFD methods can help achieve an even greater alignment of chatbot technology developments and stakeholder needs.\nWe argue that chatbot technology can not only be applied to e-commerce or e-government but can also\nimprove the quality of the e-learning services that we are providing, especially in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. Several recommendations and further works suggested by domain experts have also been highlighted in this paper, in order to improve our prototype further in the near future."
