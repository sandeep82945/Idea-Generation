 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on spatio-temporal graph neural networks for traffic forecasting:

1. Develop new graph simplification or sparsification techniques to improve the efficiency of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting without losing too much performance. The paper shows message passing may not be necessary, so finding ways to simplify the graphs could be beneficial.

2. Explore different spatial modeling techniques besides graph neural networks and the methods proposed in this paper. There may be other effective ways to capture spatial dependencies that are simple and efficient. 

3. Combine the strengths of graph neural networks and the techniques proposed in this paper. For example, using a simplified graph with the proximity and correlation modeling may give good performance with improved efficiency.

4. Apply the techniques to other spatio-temporal forecasting domains like air quality prediction, climate modeling, etc. The methods may transfer well to other problems with spatial and temporal components.

5. Develop more advanced temporal modeling techniques tailored for traffic forecasting. The paper shows even simple recurrent models work well, but there may be opportunities to design specialized temporal architectures to capture traffic patterns.
