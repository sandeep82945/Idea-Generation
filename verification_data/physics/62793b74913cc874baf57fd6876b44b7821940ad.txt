"The goal of this work was to direct attention to emerging and novel research involving magnetogel nanohybrid materials that might be relevant in future applications for the treatment of wastewater, as well as in other fields. Generally, composite hydrogels are promising adsorbents with tunable features, and we demonstrated that the addition of effective functional groups in nanohybrid materials through chemical conjugation is a promising strategy to further improve the adsorption abilities of hydrogels."
