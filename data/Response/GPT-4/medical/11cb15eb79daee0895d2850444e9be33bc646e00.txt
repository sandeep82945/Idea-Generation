Exploring the Regulatory Mechanisms of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in CKD-Induced Atherosclerosis: Given the pivotal role ADAM10 and ADAM17 play in CKD and its progression to CVD, detailed mechanistic studies could elucidate how these enzymes contribute to the pathophysiology of CKD-induced atherosclerosis. Research could focus on the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms through which ADAM10 and ADAM17 mediate their effects, including the shedding of key substrates like EGFR ligands, chemokines, and Klotho.

Investigating the Cross-Talk Between Kidney Injury and Systemic Vascular Dysfunction: The narrative review underscores the systemic effects of kidney injury on vascular health, particularly through the release of soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying ADAMs or their substrates. Future studies could explore how kidney-derived EVs contribute to vascular dysfunction and calcification in CKD, potentially uncovering new targets for therapeutic intervention to mitigate CKD-induced CVD.

Development of Cell-Specific or Substrate-Specific Inhibitors of ADAM10/ADAM17: The review suggests that ADAM10 and ADAM17 have cell-specific and potentially conflicting roles in atherosclerosis and CKD. This opens the door to research focused on developing inhibitors that are either cell-specific or substrate-specific, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of broad-spectrum ADAM inhibition which may have undesirable side effects due to the enzymes' widespread roles in the body.

Role of ADAMs in Cardiorenal Syndrome and Potential Therapeutic Interventions: Given the association between ADAM17 levels and cardiovascular events in CKD patients, and the potential role of ADAM10 in the CXCL16/CXCR6 pathway in cardiorenal disease, there's a significant scope for investigating how modulating ADAM activity could influence cardiorenal syndrome outcomes. This could include the exploration of vitamin D supplementation or other pharmacological approaches to inhibit ADAM activity as a means to reduce systemic inflammation and related CV mortality in CKD patients.

Understanding the Impact of ADAM-Mediated Shedding on the Kidney and Cardiovascular System Using Omics Approaches: Utilizing proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to comprehensively analyze the impact of ADAM-mediated shedding on the kidney and cardiovascular system in the context of CKD could offer new insights. This could involve studying changes in the proteome and transcriptome related to ADAM activity in CKD patients, comparing them with healthy controls to identify novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets that could help in early detection, prognosis, and treatment of CKD-induced CVD.
