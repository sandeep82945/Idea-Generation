1. **Investigate the effects of LicA and LicB on GLP-1 and GIP levels in vivo.** This could be done using animal models of T2DM, and would help to determine whether LicA and LicB can improve glucose control by increasing the levels of these hormones.
2. **Evaluate the safety and efficacy of LicA and LicB in humans.** This could be done through clinical trials, and would help to determine whether LicA and LicB are safe and effective for the treatment of T2DM.
3. **Explore the potential of LicA and LicB to inhibit other enzymes involved in glucose metabolism.** This could help to identify new targets for the treatment of T2DM.
4. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which LicA and LicB inhibit DPP-4.** This could be done using biochemical and structural studies, and would help to understand how LicA and LicB interact with DPP-4.
5. **Develop new DPP-4 inhibitors based on the structures of LicA and LicB.** This could be done using computational and medicinal chemistry approaches, and would help to identify new compounds with improved potency and selectivity for DPP-4.
