    "abstractText": "In this study, we propose a nonlocal operator method (NOM) for the dynamic analysis of (thin) Kirchhoff plates. The nonlocal Hessian operator is derived based on a second-order Taylor series expansion. The NOM does not require any shape functions and associated derivatives as \u2019classical\u2019 approaches such as FEM, drastically facilitating the implementation. Furthermore, NOM is higher order continuous, which is exploited for thin plate analysis that requires C continuity. The nonlocal dynamic governing formulation and operator energy functional for Kirchhoff plates are derived from a variational principle. The Verlet-velocity algorithm is used for the time discretization. After confirming the accuracy of the nonlocal Hessian operator, several numerical examples are simulated by the nonlocal dynamic Kirchhoff plate formulation.",

The mechanical analysis of rectangular thin plates has always been one of the research focuses of scholars and engineers. The governing equation of the Kirchhoff plate bending problem is a fourth-order partial differential equation whose deflection is an independent variable. The numerical method for developing this problem has a wide scientific significance for solving plate/shell problems.\nThe analysis of Kirchhoff plate bending problems poses challenges to \u2019classical\u2019 finite element formulations [1\u20135], which are only C0 continuous. However, the Kirchhoff plate problem is a fourth-order partial differential equation which requires a C1 formulation if weak form based methods such as FEM are employed. An efficient alternative are so-called meshless methods as many of them are higher order continuous. The approximation function of the meshless method [6\u201311] represented by the Element-free Galerkin method EFG [12\u201315] is highly smooth, that is, and the high-order\ncontinuity is satisfied, meantime the meshless method is easy to form high-order. The approximate function has significant advantages to the numerical solutions for higherorder partial-differential equations.\nRabczuk [16] devised a meshfree method for thin shell analysis for finite strains and arbitrary evolving cracks exploiting the higher order continuity of the EFG shape functions and avoiding any rotational degrees of freedom. Mohammed et\u00a0al. [17, 18] presented a meshless method to analyze the mechanical response of elastic thin plates. However, since meshless shape functions are commonly rational functions, more integration points are needed to evaluate the weak form. For example, Brebbia [6] employed 6 \u00d7 6 quadrature points, which significantly reduces the computational efficiency. An interesting alternative to meshless methods is isogeometric analysis (IGA) [19, 20], which also fulfills the higher order continuity requirement needed for thin plate analysis. This method takes advantage of NURBS/B-Spline basis functions, which are commonly used in computeraided-design (CAD) to describe the geometries. IGA has been successfully applied to the analysis of plates and shells for instance in [21\u201325]. As CAD geometries are surface representations, they are particularly suited for plates and shells. * Yongzheng Zhang\nyongzheng.zhang@uni-weimar.de\n1 Institute of\u00a0Structural Mechanics, Bauhaus-University Weimar, 99423\u00a0Weimar, Germany\n1 3\nOne difficulty occurs for multi-patch geometries, which are still difficult to deal with.\nIn this study, we take advantage of nonlocal theories as suggested for instance in nonlocal continuum field theories with various physical fields [26], peridynamics (PD) [27], nonlocal plasticity, (nonlocal) damage mechanics [28] and nonlocal vector calculus [29]. Nonlocal operator method (NOM) [30, 31] is a nonlocal numerical method for solving partial differential equations. The method is based on socalled differential operators. In contrast to finite elements, the NOM only needs neighboring points to develop nonlocal derivatives. Similar to the machine learning approach [32, 33], it can solve PDEs directly instead of the need of shape functions, which plays an equivalent role as the derivatives of the shape functions in the meshless methods or the FEM. And, therefore, the complexity of the nonlocal operator method is significantly reduced. The nonlocal strong form can be derived by a variational derivation on the functional defined by nonlocal operators. This paper presents a nonlocal operator method to predict the dynamic response of Kirchhoff plates exploiting the higher order continuity of the NOM.\nThe paper is organized as follows: We first briefly review the NOM and derive the nonlocal Hessian operator for Kirchhoff plates in Sect.\u00a02. In Sect.\u00a03, we derive the nonlocal dynamic Kirchhoff plate formulation by a variational formulation. Section\u00a04 presents details about the numerical implementation before we demonstrate the performance of the formulation through several benchmark problems in Sect.\u00a05. We conclude the manuscript in Sect.\u00a06.\n2 Outline of\u00a0nonlocal operator method and\u00a0derivation of\u00a0nonlocal Hessian operator for\u00a0Kirchhoff plate\n2.1 Outline of\u00a0nonlocal operator method\nWe consider a Kirchhoff plate occupying a domain as illustrated in Fig.\u00a01. Let us denote the spatial coordinates with i , ij \u2236= j \u2212 i is relative position vector from i to j ; wi \u2236= w( i, t) and wj \u2236= w( j, t) are the displacement value for i and j , respectively; the relative displacement area for the spatial vector ij is wij \u2236= wj \u2212 wi.\nThe support and the dual-support are two fundamental principles in NOM. The domain, in which every spatial point j forms the spatial vector ij from i to j is called the support Si of point i , see Fig.\u00a01b. We can write S = { 2, 3, 5, 6} . The dual-support of i is defined as a union of points which supports include , i.e.\nThe dual-support of point j forms the dual-vector \ufffd ij (= i \u2212 j) in S \u2032 i and is denoted as S\ufffd = { 3, 6} ; \u2032ij is the Sj relative position space vector. NOM requires fundamental nonlocal operators that replace the local operators in calculus. Thus, the functional designed to construct a residual and tangent stiffness matrix is formulated in terms of the nonlocal differential operator. The higher order nonlocal operator \ud835\udf15\ud835\udefcwi for the scalar field w in support Si can be expressed as [34]\n(1)S\ufffdi = { j| i \u2208 Sj}\n1 3\nwhere ( ij) represents the weight function, ij represents relative position vector. ij represent the list of polynomials. For example, the polynomials and the higher order nonlocal operator in 2D with maximal second-order derivatives are ij = (xij, yij, x 2 ij \u22152, xijyij, y 2 ij \u22152)T and \ud835\udf15\ud835\udefcwi = ( \ud835\udf15wi\ud835\udf15x , \ud835\udf15wi \ud835\udf15y , \ud835\udf152wi \ud835\udf15x2 , \ud835\udf152wi \ud835\udf15xy , \ud835\udf152wi \ud835\udf15y2 )T.\nUsing nodal integration, the higher order nonlocal operator and it\u2019s variation for a vector field w in discrete forms are\nWe use a penalty energy functional to obtain the linear field of the scalar field to eliminate zero-energy modes. The higher order operator energy functional for a scalar field w at a point i is defined as\nwhere mi(= \u222bSi \ud835\udf19( ij) ij \u2297 ijdVj) is the normalization coefficient and w is the penalty coefficient. The nonuniform aspect of the deformation is defined as T\nij \ud835\udf15\ud835\udefcwi \u2212 wij , and the\nstability of the NOM is greatly enhanced while T ij \ud835\udf15\ud835\udefcwi \u2212 wij is enforced explicitly.\n2.2 Derivation of\u00a0nonlocal Hessian operator for\u00a0Kirchhoff plate\nIn this part, we derive the second-order nonlocal Hessian operator and its variation. The second derivative and its variation in 1D is given as\nTo devise the nonlocal Hessian operator in 2D, let us define first the vector ij = (xij, yij)T .

After verifying the accuracy of the nonlocal Hessian operator, several benchmark problems are studied and compared to results obtained by ABAQUS using the S4R plate/shell element [36].\n5.1 Verification of\u00a0nonlocal Hessian operator\nLet us consider a simply supported square Kirchhoff plate with a width of a0 = 10 m and thickness t=0.01m. The\nplate is subjected to a uniform pressure of qz = 100N\u2215m2 . Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio are E=30GPa and =0.3, respectively. The number of neighbors of each point is set to n = 24 . To test the accuracy of the nonlocal Hessian operator, we assume \u03a5 = 1, 3 (see Eq.58). The analytical solution of this problem is given in [37], i.e.\nwith \u03a5 = \u03a5 2 .\nWe employ the quintic spline function as weight function\nwith = \u2016 \u2016 , h is the maximum length of support, d = (35\u221540, 377\u2215478 , 37\u221540 ) with different dimensional space d and x+ = max (0, x).\nTo accurately represent the relative error of the operator, we consider points at y = 0 . Figs.\u00a05, 6 show the deflection curve of the numerical simulation ( 2w\nx2 , 2w x y , 2w y2 ) compared\nto the analytical solution. We also check the error in the L2-norm given by\n(58)\nw = 4q0a0\n4\n5D0 \u221e\u2211 \u03a5=1,3,... 1 \u03a55\n( 1 \u2212 \u03a5 tanh \u03a5 + 2\n2 cosh \u03a5 cosh\n2 \u03a5y\na0 +\n\u03a5\n2 cosh \u03a5\n2y a0 sinh 2 \u03a5y a0\n)\nsin \u03a5 x\na0\n(59)\n( ) = d\n( (1 \u2212 \u2215h)5\n+ \u2212 6(\n2 3 \u2212 \u2215h)5 + + 15( 1 3 \u2212 \u2215h)5 +\n)\n(60)\u2016w\u2016L2 = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u2211 j(wj \u2212 w exact j ) \u22c5 (wj \u2212 w exact j\n)\u0394Vj\u2211 j w exact j \u22c5 wexact j \u0394Vj\n1 3\nwhich is shown in Fig.\u00a04.\n5.2 Nonlocal dynamic Kirchhoff plate formulation with\u00a0simply supported boundary condition\nWe now focus on a simply supported square Kirchhoff plate with a width of a0 = 1 m and thickness t=0.01m. Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio are E=200GPa and =0.3, respectively. A uniform pressure of qz = 100N\u2215m2 is applied to the plate. The number of neighbors in the domain of influence of each point is set to n = 24 . The distance between points is selected as \u0394x=0.01 m leading to 10201 points. For the ABAQUS model\u2014as a comparison\u2014we discretized the plate into 100 \u00d7 100 elements using the same input parameters.\nSimply supported boundary conditions are assumed:\n(61) w(x, 0) = w(x, 1) = w(0, y) = w(1, y) = 0 x, y \u2208 [0, 1].\n1 3\nContour plots of the deflection can be found in Figs.\u00a07 and 8, respectively.\n5.3 Nonlocal dynamic Kirchhoff plate formulation with\u00a0clamped boundary condition\nNext, a plate using clamped boundary conditions is studied. The geometry and the parameters of the previous section are adopted. The clamped boundary conditions are given by\nContour plots of the deflection are illustrated in Figs.\u00a09 and 10, respectively.\n5.4 Transient test of\u00a0nonlocal dynamic Kirchhoff plate formulation with\u00a0simply supported boundary condition\nThe last example is a simply supported plate where the damping is omitted. A uniform pressure of qz = 100N\u2215m2 is applied to the plate and the neighbors assigned to each point is set to n = 30 . All other parameters are adopted from the previous example. Figure\u00a011 shows the deflection field at different times.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, a nonlocal dynamic Kirchhoff plate formulation based on a nonlocal operator method is proposed. Therefore, we derived the explicit form of the nonlocal Hessian operator taking advantage of a second order Taylor series expansion. The nonlocal operator energy functional is also derived and the relationship between local and nonlocal formulations is interpreted. In the numerical simulation section, we first verify the accuracy of the nonlocal Hessian operator for the Kirchhoff plate and compare it to analytical solutions. Subsequently, the nonlocal dynamic Kirchhoff plate formulation with different type boundary conditions (clamped and simply supported) is studied and compared to simulations obtained by ABAQUS. In the future, we intend to extend the formulation for nonlinear dynamic fracture exploiting the advantages and flexibility of NOM in this direction.\nAcknowledgements The research was supported by the China Scholarship Council.
