While intrusions represent the core, defining symptom cluster of PTSD, 2 potentially distinct processes have recently been proposed to comprise these symptoms: internally generated symptoms (eg, flashbacks and nightmares); and externally generated symptoms (eg, physiological/emotional reactivity following trauma reminders).1 However, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated whether this more refined phenotypic model of intrusive symptoms provides a better empirical fit to PTSD symptom data than current models, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5)2 4-cluster model and the 7-factor model, which proposes hybrid anhedonia and hypervigilance clusters.3 To address this gap, we evaluated a PTSD model that divides intrusions into internally and externally cued symptoms. We compared the fit of this model with the DSM-5 and 7-factor models. We then examined how these 2 intrusion clusters correlated to other PTSD symptom clusters.",

This study reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.\nTwo independent samples were analyzed. The first sample included veterans who completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)4 at admission into intensive PTSD treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) between October 2014 and September 2016. The second sample (validation) included PCL-5 records of veterans who completed the PCL-5 on entering PTSD treatment at the VA between October 2018 and September 2019. The PCL-5 assesses the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Cronbach \u03b1 was 0.90 for sample 1 and 0.93 for sample 2.\nWe used latent network modeling, a framework in which latent variables are represented by nodes, and edges between them represent partial correlations (adjusted for the influence of all other nodes).5 We compared 3 different structural models of PTSD symptoms: (1) DSM-5, (2) 7-factor model, and (3) 8-factor (internally and externally cued intrusions) (eTable in the Supplement). Model fit was independently tested and compared in samples 1 and 2 (validation). All analyses were conducted in R statistical software with the Psychonetrics package version 0.9 (R Project for Statistical Computing). P values were 2-sided, and significance was set a \u03b1 = .10. Data were analyzed from August to October 2021."

Specifically, externally cued intrusions were associated with avoidance behaviors, while internally generated intrusions were associated with dysphoric arousal.\nThis distinction between intrusive symptoms may have clinical implications. For example, externally cued intrusions may have fear-based origins that respond better to exposure therapy, while internally generated intrusions may be linked to more cognitive-ruminative processes and thus, will need a different therapeutic approach.\nWhile the cross-sectional and veteran-specific samples limit the generalizability of this study, results suggest that separating intrusive symptoms may provide a more nuanced phenotypic representation of the phenotypic expression of PTSD. Further research is needed to examine neurobiological underpinnings of these symptom clusters, and their utility in informing the prognosis of PTSD and precision medicine-based interventions for this disorder.\nARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: February 2, 2022.\nPublished: March 21, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.3555\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Duek O et al.
