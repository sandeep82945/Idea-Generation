    "abstractText": "Mitoxantrone (MX) is a robust chemotherapeutic with well-characterized applications in treating certain leukemias and advanced breast and prostate cancers. The canonical mechanism of action associated with MX is its ability to intercalate DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II, giving it the designation of a topoisomerase II poison. Years after FDA approval, investigations have unveiled novel protein-binding partners, such as methylCpG-binding domain protein (MBD2), PIM1 serine/threonine kinase, RAD52, and others that may contribute to the therapeutic profile of MX. Moreover, recent proteomic studies have revealed MX\u2019s ability to modulate protein expression, illuminating the complex cellular interactions of MX. Although mechanistically relevant, the differential expression across the proteome does not address the direct interaction with potential binding partners. Identification and characterization of these MX-binding cellular partners will provide the molecular basis for the alternate mechanisms that influence MX\u2019s cytotoxicity. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of a MX-biotin probe (MXP) and negative control (MXP-NC) that can be used to define MX\u2019s cellular targets and expand our understanding of the proteome-wide profile for MX. In proof of concept studies, we used MXP to successfully isolate a recently identified protein-binding partner of MX, RAD52, in a cell lysate pulldown with streptavidin beads and western blotting.

            "text": "Mitoxantrone (MX) is a robust chemotherapeutic with well-characterized applications in\ntreating certain leukemias and advanced breast and prostate cancers. The canonical\nmechanism of action associated with MX is its ability to intercalate DNA and inhibit\ntopoisomerase II, giving it the designation of a topoisomerase II poison. Years after FDA\napproval, investigations have unveiled novel protein-binding partners, such as methyl-\nCpG-binding domain protein (MBD2), PIM1 serine/threonine kinase, RAD52, and others\nthat may contribute to the therapeutic profile of MX. Moreover, recent proteomic studies\nhave revealed MX\u2019s ability to modulate protein expression, illuminating the complex\ncellular interactions of MX. Although mechanistically relevant, the differential expression\nacross the proteome does not address the direct interaction with potential binding\npartners. Identification and characterization of these MX-binding cellular partners will\nprovide the molecular basis for the alternate mechanisms that influence MX\u2019s cytotoxicity.\nHere, we describe the design and synthesis of a MX-biotin probe (MXP) and negative\ncontrol (MXP-NC) that can be used to define MX\u2019s cellular targets and expand our\nunderstanding of the proteome-wide profile for MX. In proof of concept studies, we used\nMXP to successfully isolate a recently identified protein-binding partner of MX, RAD52, in\na cell lysate pulldown with streptavidin beads and western blotting.\nGraphical abstract (Draft)\nHighlights\n An 8-step synthesis was used to generate a biotinylated-mitoxantrone probe\n(MXP).\n A pulldown of MXP demonstrated selectivity for RAD52, but not Replication Protein\nA.\n Western blot confirmed the identity of the isolated protein, RAD52.\nTarget identification and validation are key pillars of the drug discovery process.1-3\nBiochemical probes facilitate the identification of drug targets or additional cellular binding partners that may contribute to off-target effects.1, 4 Such probes have driven target-\nbased studies that profile drug interactions and elucidated the mechanism of action (MoA). These studies also guide future modification and optimization.3, 5, 6\nIn recent years, biotinylated-small molecule probes have had an immense impact on\nproteome-wide target profiling (Fig. 1). Examples include the biotinylated-resveratrol\nprobe (Fig.1A) generated by Chen et al. that led to the identification of histone deacetylase I (HDAC1) as a cellular target of resveratrol.7, 8 Also, a biotinylated-triptolide\nprobe (Fig. 1B) synthesized by Zhao et al. revealed peroxiredoxin I (Prx1) as a target of triptolide.9 Additional examples of biotinylated probes are included in Figure 1.7-13 These\nprobe-based studies, and many others, are prime examples of using chemical biology\ntools to study complex interactions and interpret MoAs that are otherwise poorly understood.5, 14, 15\nMitoxantrone (MX) is a prominent anthracycline chemotherapeutic routinely used in\noncology clinics. MX was originally approved in 1988 for the treatment of acute myeloid\nleukemia (AML) and has since shown promise in the treatment of other hematological\nmalignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL).16 Additionally, MX has shown efficacy in advanced breast and prostate cancers.17 The canonical MoA associated with MX is its capacity to intercalate DNA and stabilize the topoisomerase II cleavage complex.16, 17 MX was engineered to be a less cardiotoxic analog of doxorubicin that retains its therapeutic efficacy.16, 17 The divergence\nin cardiotoxicities between MX and doxorubicin is largely thought to be influenced by\ndifferences in membrane lipid peroxidation that generates reactive oxygen species to damage cardiac tissue.16, 17 Another factor is the selective inhibition of different isoforms of topoisomerase II (\u03b1 and \u03b2).16, 17 Despite these findings, various biological assays continue to identify novel MX targets that may contribute to its anticancer activity.18-27\nAlthough numerous studies have evaluated MX clinically and pharmacologically, its\nprominent DNA intercalation activity associated with MX overshadows additional potential cellular targets in the literature.17 Consequently, unique interactions of MX and their\nrespective effects remain to be fully elucidated. In recent years, several research groups\nhave begun unraveling additional targets of MX, demonstrating its promiscuous nature and underscoring the limit to our understanding of its \u2018off-target\u2019 effects.17-27 For example,\nour group previously identified MX as an inhibitor of the protein-protein interaction\nbetween RAD52 and Replication Protein A (RPA), a promising drug target for homologous recombination-deficient cancers.27 This discovery prompted our group to\nsynthesize a probe that could be used to not only validate our previous findings but also\nadvance the understanding of MX\u2019s complex cellular interactions. It is clear that further\nproteomic-profiling studies are required to fully comprehend MX\u2019s additional MoAs.\nProteomic analysis can reveal novel interactions of candidate compounds or existing\ndrugs. Several strategies can be employed to determine the proteome-wide target profile\nof a given compound; these methods are generally compound-centric or mechanismcentric.1 Proteomic methods that are compound-centric typically modify the original\ncompound to generate probes suitable for chemical biology studies such as target enrichment or fluorescent labeling of target proteins in cell extracts.1, 2, 6, 14, 15, 28 Click\nchemistry is often used to generate these probes, and thus, has majorly contributed to the understanding target profiles and MoAs.5, 6 The probe-isolated target proteins can be\nconfirmed using western blotting or mass spectrometry. Although the biological probes\nare useful in deducing MoAs, they are challenging to generate since they must retain their\nbio-activity to be effective and reliable. In contrast, mechanism-centric proteomic\nmethods analyze the differences in protein abundance, expression levels, posttranslational modifications, and localization.1, 3 These methods provide insight into the\ncellular consequences associated with the compound but not necessarily defining the initiating event, i.e., target-binding.1, 3\nHere, we focus on compound-centric chemical biology studies. Compound-centric\nstudies reveal target protein profiles providing insights into differing molecular mechanisms and off-target effects.1, 3 This information can influence the continual optimization of the compound to increase efficacy and decrease inadvertent side effects.3, 29 For example, we previously reported the discovery of a spirocyclic analog (19) as an inhibitor of IKK\u03b2-mediated NF-\u03baB activation.30, 31 Subsequent studies using a\nbiotinylated-analog 19 probe unveiled a proteome-wide target profile that identified over 330 proteins that are modified by analog 19.32 This led to the discovery of spirocyclic\ndimers (SpiDs) as promising anticancer agents that inhibited cancer cell growth, and induced apoptosis through activation of unfolded protein response.32, 33\nTo assess MX\u2019s selectivity for RAD52 and to define the proteome-wide profile of MX,\nwe synthesized a biotinylated-MX-probe (MXP). In a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated\nthat MXP indeed selectively binds to recombinant human RAD52 but not RPA in\nEscherichia coli lysates that have an abundance of these two proteins. The clickable\nMXP can be used in biological studies to not only validate other targets of MXP but also\ndefine the proteome-wide target profile.\nScheme 1 depicts the strategy used to synthesize MXP and MXP-NC. In brief, SN2 displacement of one of the bromine atoms in 1,5-dibromopentane (1) by propargyl alcohol\nusing sodium hydride as base yielded 2. N-Boc protection of both nitrogen atoms of 2-\n((2-aminoethyl)amino)ethan-1-ol (3) yielded the second linker fragment 4. Under the\nWilliamsons ether synthesis conditions, the SN2 displacement of the bromine atom in 2\nby the hydroxyl group in 4 gave compound 5. Deprotection of the Boc groups in 5 resulted\nin the key fragment with the alkyne tag 6. Aluminum chloride catalyzed Friedel-Craft\nacylation between 4,7-difluoroisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (7) and hydroquinone (8) gave 1,4-difluoro-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9,10-dione (9) in 65% yield.34 The sequential ArSN2 displacement of the fluorine atoms in 9 by compounds 6 and 3 in DMF yielded 10 and 11,\nrespectively. The click reaction between alkyne tagged 11 and biotin-PEG3-azide\nresulted in the title compound, MXP as blue solid in 31% yield. A negative control, MXP-\nNC, was synthesized by SN2 displacement of bromine atom of 1-bromopentane (12) by propargyl alcohol followed by click reaction with biotin-PEG3-azide (Scheme 1).\nAdditional information regarding methods and synthesis can be found in the suppl\nScheme 1. Reagents and conditions: (i) NaH, propargyl alcohol, DMF, 0\u00b0C to rt, 15 h;\n(ii) (BOC)2O, THF:EtOH (1:1), rt, 16 h; (iii) NaH, 2, DMF, 0\u00b0C to rt, 15 h; (iv) 4M HCl in Dioxane, DCM, rt, 12 h; (v) AlCl3, NaCl, 200oC, 2 h; (vi) 6, DIPEA, DMF, 50oC, 6 h; (vii) 3, DMF, 50oC, 6 h; (viii) Biotin-PEG3-azide, Sodium abcorbate, TBTA, CuSO4.5H2O, DMSO, H2O, t-BuOH, rt, 8 h; (ix) NaH, propargyl alcohol, DMF, 0\u00b0C to rt, 15 h; (x) BiotinPEG3-azide , Sodium abcorbate, TBTA, CuSO4.5H2O, DMSO, H2O, t-BuOH, rt, 8 h.\nWe previously reported that MX inhibited the RPA:RAD52 interaction using a highthroughput compatible FluorIA assay.27 We hypothesized that a MXP could be used to\ndetermine if MX binds to RAD52 or RPA using a pulldown study from E. coli lysates\ncontaining the two proteins. Figure 2 illustrates the pulldown of RAD52 using MXP in a\nRAD52-overexpressing E. coli cell lysate with magnetic streptavidin-coated beads. After\novernight incubation of MXP and the cell lysate at room temperature, the magnetic beads\nwere added to the sample for an additional 1-hour incubation. The supernatant fraction\nwas stored after magnetic separation, and the beads were washed three times with lysis\n(wash) buffer. Following the 5-minute incubation with elution buffer (0.1 M Glycine, pH\n2.0), the cellular components directly interacting with MXP were eluted from the probe,\nleading to an elution fraction enriched with binding partners. The presence of RAD52 was observed via SDS-PAGE gel stained with SYPROTM Ruby dye (Figure 2A) and\nvalidated using an automated nanocapillary-based western blot system (Peggy Sue by\nProtein Simple) (Figure 2B). To evaluate whether MXP would isolate RPA, we included\nan E. coli cell lysate sample spiked with 0.06 mg/mL of purified RPA. Our SDS-PAGE\nresults indicated that RAD52 was isolated in the lysate but was not immediately visible in\nthe elution from the RPA-spiked lysate. Western blot was used for a more sensitive\nevaluation of our supernatant and elution samples.\nPeggy Sue western blots were performed following the Protein Simple manufacturer\u2019s\nguidelines for the 12-230 size separation kit. Lysate samples were diluted to 0.04 mg/mL\nor 0.004 mg/mL as instructed. Primary antibodies against RAD52 and RPA (proteintechTM 28045-1-AP and Bethyl A300-241A) were used at a 1:200 dilution.\nCompass software (Protein Simple) was used to analyze the data. Further investigation\nusing western blot found that RAD52 was in both the supernatant and elution of the RPAspiked lysate samples. This indicated that the sensitivity of the SYPROTM Ruby dye was\ntoo low to detect RAD52 in the RPA-spiked samples for the SDS-PAGE gel, but levels of\nRAD52 were detectable via a western blot.\nCollectively, we have successfully synthesized a MXP that holds immense potential\nas a valuable tool for studying the chemical biology MX. The preliminary pulldown\nexperiment demonstrated that MXP indeed interacts with cellular components and\nisolates a novel protein-binding partner. Moreover, it corroborates previous observations\nthat MX interacts with RAD52, potentially implicating RAD52-inhibition as a promising complementary MoA in targeting homologous-recombination deficient cancers.27 Though\nMX has predominantly been thought of as a topoisomerase II poison, recent literature suggests the promiscuity of MX is understudied.18-26 Future studies using MXP may\nreveal additional binding partners and shed light on MX\u2019s complex cellular interactions,\nenhancing our understanding of its proteome-wide target profile and additional modes of\naction that contribute to its therapeutic efficacy."
