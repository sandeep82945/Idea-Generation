Excited symptoms are the core symptoms of SZ, which appear in the early stage, followed by other stages of the disease subsequently. These symptoms are destructive and more prone to violent attacks, posing a serious economic burden to the society. Abnormal spontaneous activity in the orbitofrontal cortex had been reported to be associated with excited symptoms in patients with SZ. However, whether the abnormality appears in first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ has still remained elusive.\nMethods: A total of 56 first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ and 27 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). First, differences in fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) between first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ and healthy controls were examined to identify cerebral regions exhibiting abnormal local spontaneous activity. Based on the fALFF results, the resting-state functional connectivity analysis was performed to determine changes in cerebral regions exhibiting abnormal local spontaneous activity. Finally, the correlation between abnormal functional connectivity and exciting symptoms was analyzed.\nResults: Compared with the healthy controls, first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ showed a significant decrease in intrinsic activity in the bilateral precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, and the left orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ had significantly reduced functional connectivity values between the left orbitofrontal cortex and several cerebral regions, which were mainly distributed in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, the right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral paracentral lobules, the left precentral gyrus, and the right median cingulate. Further analyses showed that the functional connectivity between the left orbitofrontal cortex and the left postcentral gyrus, as well as bilateral paracentral lobules, was negatively correlated with excited symptoms in first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 922272\nConclusion: Our results indicated the important role of the left orbitofrontal cortex in first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ and suggested that the abnormal spontaneous activity of the orbitofrontal cortex may be valuable to predict the occurrence of excited symptoms. These results may provide a new direction to explore the excited symptoms of SZ.\nKeywords: schizophrenia, orbitofrontal cortex, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, functional connectivity, hostility, impulsivity"

            "text": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is one of the most serious and disabling mental diseases (1). However, due to the complexity of brain structure and functional activities, the etiology of SZ has not been fully clarified yet. Researchers have put forward a series of hypotheses, demonstrating that abnormal cerebral blood flow and neurobiochemical activities may lead to clinical symptoms (2\u20136). A large number of studies have pointed out that compared with healthy individuals, SZ patients are at a significantly increased risk of excited symptoms (including excitement, hostility, uncooperativeness, and impulsivity) by 2.1\u20134.6 times (7, 8). The sudden events, such as destroyed items and violent assaults, are mainly associated with excited symptoms in patients with SZ, which have posed a great burden to society (9\u201313). Patients with excited symptoms may experience substance abuse, which may prolong the treatment cycle and deteriorate clinical treatment results (13\u201315). Nevertheless, few clinical studies have yet concentrated on excited symptoms in patients with SZ.\nHostility is the expression of anger or resentment toward others in terms of words or actions (13). Impulsivity is an obstacle to the regulation and control of internal impulse response when integrating internal and external stimuli (16\u2013 19), which may lead to reckless emotional catharsis and violence (20, 21). Patients with SZ lack the ability to timely deal with negative emotions. That is to say, they are highly sensitive to negative emotions and prone to negative urgency (10, 21). In SZ patients with delusions and hallucinations, sudden impulsive behavior in the face of stress or other extreme events is caused by uncontrolled internal regulation of emotional responses, as well as imbalance in external motor inhibition (16, 22). Such impulsive behaviors, which not accompany by poor prognostic outcomes, but also increase the burden of disease, are highly prevalent in patients with first-episode and chronic SZ (22\u201324). Hostility and impulsivity are the most problematic symptoms in patients with SZ (13). The study of impulsivity and hostility in patients with excited symptoms may provide new ideas for understanding the neuropathological mechanisms of SZ (25).\nHostility and impulsivity are closely associated with dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, especially the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (26). Studies have shown that impulsive, hostile, and antisocial behaviors are perpetrated by healthy individuals after OFC damage (27). OFC serves as a central region of emotional integration and inhibitory control (28). Alterations\nin this cerebral region have been demonstrated to be strongly associated with impulsive behaviors in patients with psychiatric disorders (18, 26). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggested that patients with SZ who were more impulsive showed larger gray and white matter volumes, as well as a smaller cortical thickness in the OFC area compared with those with no history of impulsivity (10, 29). Functional MRI studies revealed that patients with impulsivity showed anomalous functional connections between the OFC and anterior cingulate gyrus (19, 30). In addition, several MRI studies demonstrated that the reduced gray matter volume in OFC is negatively correlated with the severity of emotional instability, and an abnormal OFC function has also been shown to be associated with the expressions of negative emotions, such as anxiety and fear in patients with SZ (4, 6, 31, 32). OFC regulates negative emotions by receiving and transmitting relevant emotional information. After functional impairment, it shows emotional vulnerability and irritability (3, 5, 32, 33). Given that the OFC is a central element in the emotional and behavioral response network and plays a central role in both emotional regulation and motor inhibition (28), it is hypothesized that the dysfunction of the OFC is the basis of the manifestation of excited symptoms in patients with SZ.\nOFC neurons are common targets for classic and glutamatergic antipsychotic drugs (34). After drug therapy for patients with chronic SZ, the functional activity of OFC increases significantly, and its association with excited symptoms may be affected (35). Previous studies could not well exclude the above-mentioned confounding factors (36). Therefore, after removing the effects of the course of the disease, the long-term use of antipsychotics, and progressive cerebral atrophy on OFC function, exploring the damage to OFC function in patients with first-episode SZ may assist clinicians in the early identification or remission of excited symptoms.\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is emerging as a valuable biomarker for measuring connectivity of the brain in patients with neural disorders. It can non-invasively measure internal neural activity with a great stability. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is the most commonly used index to measure the intensity of regional spontaneous cerebral activities (37, 38). However, when capturing the relative amplitude of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuation in gray matter, a higher frequency range (> 0.08 Hz) of ALFF is sensitive to the interference of physiological factors, such as heartbeat, respiration, etc. (31, 37, 39). The fractional ALFF (fALFF) method\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 922272\nprovides a relative estimate of the BOLD signal intensity in the relevant frequency band (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) (37, 40). After significantly lessening non-specific signal components, the fALFF improved the sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous cerebral activities (37, 41). As another frequently used index, resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis describes the functional correlation among spatially unconnected cerebral regions (42, 43). Preliminary studies of SZ have reported abnormal fALFF in complex cerebral regions. The fALFF-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analytical strategy has been scarcely utilized to examine the functional interactions of cerebral regions that showed an altered fALFF in drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ.\nThe present cross-sectional study has mainly concentrated on OFC to explore abnormalities in the spontaneous cerebral activity of first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ. A great number of patients with the first onset of SZ who received few medical treatments, as well as age-, gender-, educational level-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. All subjects underwent fMRI scan and positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Firstly, we attempted to determine the abnormal spontaneous cerebral activity in first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ, which was measured by fALFF. It was supposed that the neural networks associated with OFC would be vulnerable. Secondly, we considered cerebral regions found in the previous fALFF analysis to compare the functional cerebral activities between first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ and HCs. Finally, to indicate whether the abnormalities found in the fALFF and fALFF-based rsFC analyses would be associated with excited symptoms in patients with SZ, we analyzed the correlation between abnormal indices and scores and sub-scores of excited symptoms."

Positive factors, such as delusions, hallucinations, and unusual thought content are mainly considered by clinicians for inclusion of patients. Negative factors (e.g., motivation and social withdrawal, blunted affect, as well as motor retardation) were reported as prognostic factors (32). General psychopathology is composed of excited factors (mainly involving impulsive behaviors), disorganized/concrete factors (conceptual disorganization, difficulty in abstract thinking, stereotyped thinking, and poor attention), and depressed factors (anxiety, tension, guilt feelings, and depression) (46).

The linear trend of covariates was removed and corrected with Friston-24 (51). We regressed out several nuisance covariates, such as the global brain signal, the white matter signal, and the cerebrospinal fluid signal (50). DARTEL was used to standardize different brains and to increase the comparability of cerebral functional data among subjects (52). Finally, 6 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) was used for smoothing to improve the reliability of data.\nHowever, 7 first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ and three HCs were excluded due to excessive head movement when MRI scans were performed."

The significant fALFF decreased areas in the patients were used as inclusion masks in the following voxelwise correction analyses, which were carried out to explore the correction between the fALFF map and the severity of symptoms (five components of PANSS). The statistical threshold was also set at voxel level (p < 0.001 or cluster level (p < 0.05) in the TFCE.

            "text": "We, in the present study, utilized rs-fMRI data, including fALFF and fALFF-based rsFC values to measure the restingstate of spontaneous cerebral functions in first-episode drugna\u00efve patients with SZ who did not experience antipsychotic medication. The results initially confirmed that compared with HCs, first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ exhibited decreased fALFF values in the LOFC, bilateral precentral gyrus, and bilateral postcentral gyrus. In the second step, the LOFC was taken as a seed into account to explore rsFC values in firstepisode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ. We found decreased rsFC values between the LOFC and frontal cortex, including bilateral postcentral gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral paracentral lobules, the left precentral gyrus, and the right median cingulate. Finally, several correlation analyses were conducted to indicate whether the functional connectivity in the LOFC could be negatively correlated with excited symptoms, especially impulsive behaviors, and hostility. Considering the influences of potential confounding factors of the course of the disease and drugs, our results may provide a possible direction for exploring the pathogenesis of excited symptoms in first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ.\nFALFF or ALFF is an index that always measures the spontaneous activity of the cerebral regions, reflecting the levels\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 922272\nof cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose metabolism. The decreased fALFF value in the LOFC in first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ was previously reported repeatedly (23, 35). To our knowledge, OFC is important for the assessment of thoughts and intentions on social communication by information flow integration and feedback (3, 5, 56). The fALFF value reflects the speed or amount of information flow in OFC. Neuroimaging studies indicated that the density of the LOFC gray matter also decreased in first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ (4, 26, 57). The loss of gray matter volume was reported to be associated with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) dysfunction and dopamine hyperfunction, which activated neurotoxic signal transduction pathways and induced neuronal, and synaptic necrosis (5). This triggered off the compressing or blocking of the transmitted information in varying degrees, explaining the functional deactivation state of OFC. The same decreased fALFF value in the LOFC was also found in patients with impulsive SZ (30). The impaired OFC decreased the inhibitory control mechanism through GABAergic neurons, and the change of OFC might lead to the delay of impulse inhibition (18). Hoptman et al. found the increased fALFF values of OFC in patients with chronic SZ (58), which was contrary to our results. Further study suggested that antipsychotics could be effective by partially restoring the function of the frontal cortex through synaptic plasticity (35, 59). The reason for the increase in fALFF value may be that the chronic patients received medication, and the function of OFC was partially recovered and played a super-compensatory role (58). These findings suggested that the anomalous OFC function in SZ patients may be related to the time of onset.\nNumerous studies demonstrated that SZ is a functional connectivity disorder, and our research provided new evidence for this statement (59, 60). Anatomically, the paracentral lobule is the medial extension of the precentral and postcentral gyri (61). Precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus, as well as paracentral lobule possess a consistency in segregating and conveying sensorimotor information, and they are the main components of the sensorimotor network (SMN) (56, 62). Recently, it was suggested that a sufficient information flow in SMN is essential to ensure unbiased emotional and behavioral responses (63). Several studies have reported the associations of impulsive violence to motor errors and the reduced speed of perceptual information processing in daily life (21).\nThe cingulate cortex is a structure implicated in behavioral adaptation and control. The median cingulate cortex is highly connected to areas involved in action control and decision making, such as OFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor, and motor cortices. The median cingulate cortex has been emphasized to play a role in different facets of cognitive control, including response selection, attentional processing, conflict monitoring, and detecting errors (64). Our results also confirmed that the functional association between the LOFC and the right median cingulate is sparse in firstepisode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ. It was demonstrated that the median cingulate cortex harbors a large number of short cortical contact fibers connected to the frontal\ncortex (65). The decreased connectivity indicated impaired sensorimotor integration and motor control in the early onset (66, 67).\nTo better evaluate the relationship between excited symptoms and cerebral functional conditions, we further proved that the functional connection between OFC and SMN including bilateral paracentral lobules, as well as median cingulate was negatively correlated with the scores of excited symptoms. The thickness of the gray matter cortex of OFC and paracentral lobule was smaller, which was related to its perceived function in SZ (68). Anatomical studies demonstrated defects in the cingulate cortex and OFC that were bound up with impulsive behaviors and hostility in psychiatric patients and HCs (27, 52, 69\u2013 71). Due to the role of the paracentral lobule in transmitting sensory and motor information to the SMN, an abnormal connectivity could lead to misperceptions and inappropriate behaviors. People could be fully mobilized flexibility through the OFC to adapt emotions to environmental changes, and functional connectivity might lead to disease-related painful experience and expressions of abnormal emotions or behaviors. We analyzed this correlation and clarified the changes in the brain network in the early stage of SZ, and clinical excited symptoms of SZ could be attributed to abnormal OFC-SMN circuits (56). Reduced functional connectivity between OFC and MCC could lead to an attenuated ability to monitor conflicts and detect errors (64). Functional deactivation of relevant cerebral regions, reduced information flow, difficulty in synchronizing activity between cerebral regions, decreased connectivity, and other dysfunctions could occur continuously in first-episode drugna\u00efve patients with SZ. All these constitute the neuropathological basis of excited symptoms. Psychotic symptoms including excited symptoms could be effectively relieved by adherence to antipsychotic medication during the acute phase of the disease. As the target of 5-OH and DA, OFC had been shown to partially restore its function (34, 35). However, long-term antipsychotic treatment had not achieved sustained results. The future research will concentrate on performing effective and accurate treatments.\nIn the subsequent analysis, we also observed a significantly negative correlation between connectivity strength in OFC and hostility symptoms in first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ (P < 0.025). Similarly, the correlation between impulsivity and functional connection decreased, while the significance was not comparable to hostility. The possible reason is that abnormal connectivity of the OFC circuit enhanced the reactivity of negative stimuli (72), and was further considered to increase the tendency of personal hostility and impulsivity (73). Patients in our study had the first onset of SZ. The spontaneous activity and functional connection of OFC decreased, resulting in mild agitation symptoms, such as hostility. When the course of the disease continued to progress, they further showed impulsive behaviors. Based on the negative correlation, the level of functional connection between OFC and SMN deviated from the normal, representing the severity of excited symptoms. We could make full use of this result to further predict the risk of impulsive behaviors in patients with SZ.

First, the study used a cross-sectional design and could not forecast how cerebral spontaneous activity may change during the clinical course of SZ. Further studies are therefore needed to fully understand the implications of our findings. Second, the sample size of our research was small, although it was comparable to most fMRI studies on first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ, and it is essential to enrich the theoretical basis. Third, we clarified the correlation between LOFC-SMN connection and excitatory symptoms. However, it remained elusive whether the pathophysiology of excitatory symptoms originates from LOFC, SMN, or LOFC-SMN. Last but not least, our research concentrated on excited symptoms, while the severity of the symptoms varied among subjects, and the monotonic function of the measurement tool was noteworthy."
