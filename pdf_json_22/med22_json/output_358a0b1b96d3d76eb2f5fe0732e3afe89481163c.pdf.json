On the other hand, silicon (Si) can support plants to cope with Cd stress. However, the Cd stress mitigating impact of Si reduction in pea (Pisum sativum L.) is not known. The objective of this study is to see if and how Si can reduce Cd toxicity. To the end, a greenhouse pot experiment was performed twice during the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 seasons to investigate the effect of Si on the growth, anatomy, and biochemistry of Cd stressed peas plants. Cd exposure increased the contents of Cd ions in the root and shoot of pea plants. Consequentially, Cd accumulation in pea tissue significantly reduced plant growth i.e., plant height, leaf area, and shoot and root dry weights. The effect of Cd was concentration-dependent, where at low concentration (50 mg/kg soil), the plant height was 94.33 and 97.33cm and at high concentration (100 mg/kg soil), it was 89.0 and 91.0 cm in the two seasons, respectively. This growth reduction can be explained by the decrease in plants\u2019 photosynthesis, whereas plants exposed to Cd toxicity had lower chlorophyll levels. At the anatomy level, high Cd concentrations resulted in anatomical abnormalities such as an unusual vascular system, abnormal lignification in the pith parenchyma, and enlarged cortical cells. Moreover, all Cd concentrations resulted in a highly significant decrease in stomatal area and stomatal density (the number of stomata per mm2). In addition to growth inhibition, Cd-induced oxidative damage to pea plants as indicated by increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. To reduce stress toxicity, plants treated with Cd at 50 and 100 (mg/kg) showed a\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nsignificant increase in antioxidant capacity. Peroxidase (POD) enzyme activity was significantly increased by 41.26%, 28.64%, 77.05%, and 60.77% in both seasons, respectively. Si at 300 ppm under Cd (100 mg/kg) stress conductions considerably reduced (MDA) contents by 29.02% and 29.12%, in the two seasons, respectively. The findings pointed out that Si\u2019s ability to protect pea against the oxidative stress caused by Cd toxicity.\nKEYWORDS\ncadmium, Pea, oxidative stress, silicon, MDA"

            "text": "Pisum sativum L. (pea) is an annual plant that grows in the winter, and it is one of the most important energetic crops in the Leguminosae family (Fabaceae). The immature seeds of this crop are eaten as fresh, frozen, or canned vegetables. Pea, starchy vegetable with high protein, has long been regarded as a lowcost, easily available source of protein due to their high levels of key amino acids such as tryptophan and lysine (Orzo\u0142 et al., 2022). Carbohydrates (fiber and starch) are also the primary components of peas, accounting for 20 and 46% of dry matter in seeds. Pea seeds are also rich in vitamins (A, B6, C, and K), minerals (P, Mg, Cu, Fe, and Zn) and lutein content (Eid et al., 2019). Pea seeds are extensively farmed including Egypt\u2019s Nile Delta. In Egypt, the total area planted with pea was 4326.9 (ha), with a total yield of 14 t/ha of green legumes (FAO, 2014). However, different sorts of soil contaminants [including heavy metals mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd)] have an impact on vegetable growth of the West Nile Delta soil (Khalifa and Gad, 2018). Therefore, the development of agriculture in a low-input and sustainable way is urgently needed to maintain pea growth under heavy metal contaminations.\nPlants are naturally susceptible to various stress factors, including abiotic and biotic stressors. In this context, excess irrigation from drawing wells, agricultural chemical fertilizers, and quick industrial expansion has increased the number of toxic metals in agricultural soils that negatively impact the soil-plant environment system (Gadallah and Sayed, 2014; Jali et al., 2016). For instance, heavy metals-contaminated water for crop irrigation survived cadmium-rich rocks, smelting, mining, sewage sludge application, or excessive use of phosphate fertilizers (Hooda et al., 2007; Kabta-Pendias, 2011; Alloway, 2013). Because heavy metal stress negatively impacts crop development and productivity, it is of great interest to researchers (Gill, 2014). In recent years, there has been a lot of focus on heavy metals and trace elements in the environment, specifically in soil and water, as well as their effect on\n02\nplant nutrition and productivity. (Gaafar et al., 2012) who reported that carbohydrate content in white radish and Triticum aestivum L. significant decline as the heavy metal (cadmium and lead) concentration increased. For example, using polluted soil or water for agricultural cultivation reduces productivity and produces contaminated food grains and vegetables, both of which are harmful to human health (Galal and Shehata, 2015a). (Ayangbenro and Babalola, 2017) and (Zhang et al., 2018) also found that trace metals (TM) influence public health and the ecological system. Crops and vegetables that grow in heavy metalpolluted soil accumulated a higher heavy metal concentration. Using this contaminated land for crop cultivation has a negative impact on plant cultivations, leading to lower production efficiency and contaminated food grains and vegetables, both of which are harmful to plant and human health (Singh and Agrawal 2010). Because of its water solubility and movement within the ecosystem, Cd induces necrosis and chlorophyll degradation and alters nutrient absorption, cellular metabolism, carbon fixation, and membrane function (Ahmad et al., 2015; Jali et al., 2016). Cd stimulates the production of ROS, which causes severe damage to various cell organelles and, as a result, inhibits plant growth (Ahmad et al., 2016). Moreover, Cd increases the antioxidant defense systems of stressed plants as a defense strategy to cope with induced oxidative stress (Peng et al., 2017). Furthermore, Cd stress can alter gene expression in a variety of ways (Farooq et al., 2016). Thus the phytotoxic impact of such compounds on the growth, development, and productivity of economical crops should be deeply investigated.\nSilicon (Si), is not an essential element for higher plant growth, but it has improved the growth of several crops including rice, wheat, barley, and cucumber. Thus, Si is widely used as a fertilizer in numerous nations to boost productivity and ensure long-term yield (Ma et al., 2015). It has been shown to mitigate abiotic stress (e.g., salt stress, metal toxicity, drought stress, radiation damage, high temperature, and freezing), biotic stress (pests and fungi and bacteria infections), and nutritional imbalance (Ma and Yamaji,\nfrontiersin.org\n2006) . Part icularly, mult iple studies have recently demonstrated that Si represents a significant alternative to provide tolerance against the negative effects of various metals such as Cd2+ (Shi et al., 2017) and Ni2+ (Abd-Allah et al., 2019). Nonetheless, the role of Si in sustaining plant growth in the presence of toxicants remains largely unknown. According to (Rizwan et al., 2016), Si-mediated Cd toxicity mitigation includes external and internal mechanisms, such as increased nutrient uptake and decreased metal uptake and translocation. Furthermore, the formation of Cd\u2013Si cocomplexation in the cell wall reduces Cd transport to plant tissues (Ma et al., 2015). Again, (Ribera-Fonseca et al., 2018) demonstrated that reduced heavy metal uptake by Si could be attributed to root exudation of secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds and organic acids. Secretions of these compounds chelate with metal cations and limit their entry into plant roots. Furthermore, Si\u2019s protective effect against heavy metals may be related to the activation of enzymatic antioxidant processes (Farooq et al., 2016; Abd-Allah et al., 2019). According to (Hussain et al., 2015), Si application increased CAT and GPx activity in Cd-treated wheat plants compared to control plants. In this context, (Shi et al., 2017) found that increasing antioxidant activities, particularly those involved in H2O2 eradication, can reduce ROS generation in crops subjected to biotic stress Our study\u2019s objectives were to (1) determine how Cd toxicity affects pea growth, anatomical features, and biochemistry (antioxidant enzyme activities and non-enzymatic antioxidants) of Pea plants, which is one of the most important crops in Egypt, (2) gain insight into the possible mechanisms involved in Si-mediated Cd detoxification. We investigated the hypothesis that less Cd accumulation and changes improved physiological and antioxidant defense systems underlie the Cd stress mitigating effect of Si treatment."

Cadmium toxicity may stimulate ROS development in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain (Heyno et al., 2008).\nRegardless of the fact that Cd is not an oxidative metal and cannot produce ROS directly through Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions, indirect ROS production is common in Cd-exposed plants (Shahid et al., 2016). ROS can react with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids at high concentrations, causing structural and functional changes including lipid peroxidation, membrane leakage, DNA breakage, and mutation (Apel and Hirt, 2004; Andresen and K\u00fcpper, 2013). They have the ability to oxidize proteins, fatty acids, and nucleic acids, which frequently results in cell structure changes and mutagenesis (Younis et al., 2016). Cd stress also results in damage to plant membranes and the destruction of cell biomolecules and organelles (Abbas et al., 2017).\nTo cope with Cd-induced oxidative stress, Pea plants increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes like POD and CAT. Interestingly, foliar treatment with Si further increased these activities under Cd stress conditions. Similarly, Cd-induced antioxidant enzyme activation, possibly through gene expression modulation or Cd-induced inhibition of enzyme inhibitors (Rahman et al., 2017). Another mechanism by which Si alleviated Cd stress in plants was stimulating antioxidant systems in plants (Shi et al., 2005). These antioxidants worked together to alleviate oxidative injury in Si treatment (Shen et al., 2010).\nTherefore, Cd may indirectly contribute to the production of ROS through disruption in the chloroplasts of leaves (Gallego et al., 2012)."

This finding is consistent with previous research on\nFrontiers in Plant Science 16\nvarious plant species (Gaballah and Rady, 2012; Mostofa et al., 2015; Ahmad et al., 2016). Because Cd accumulated in the root is incapacitated by the cell wall and extracellular carbohydrates, higher Cd content in the root as compared to the shoot is one of the most important defense mechanisms of plants against Cd toxicity (Rahman et al., 2017). (Ahmad et al., 2016). Si application may reduce Cd accumulation in shoots; this indicates that silicon significantly negatively impacted Cd transport from roots to shoots, limiting it to root tissues. Similar findings have been reported in other monocotyledon species, including rice (Shi et al., 2005 and Zhang and Ge 2008). Kastori et al. (1992) discovered that the content of soluble proteins in Helianthus annus decreased with increasing heavy metal concentration. Protein content may be affected by heavy metals due to: (i) increased protein hydrolysis, resulting in a lower concentration of soluble proteins (ii) Lead\u2019s catalytic activity (Bhattacharyya and Choudhuri, 1997); (iii) Protein synthesis decreasing under all stress conditions. (El-Beltagi et al., 2010; Ibrahim et al., 2012). Sugar levels in pea shoots were significantly higher in Si-treated plants, but not under Cd stress (50 mg/Kg soil)."

            "text": "Heavy metal can induce alterations in anatomical parameters. Furthermore, changes in anatomical traits were rather highly reliant on Cd concentration, with the changes becoming more noticeable as Cd concentration increased. Thus, the current study found that increasing concentrations of Cd had a negative impact on the anatomical structures of the pea, despite the plant\u2019s preventing and mitigating such effects by modifying cellular structures to some extent. Among anatomical changes , degraded and smaller mesophyll tissue, the disintegration of parenchymatous tissues, cortical tissue loosening in roots of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Talukdar, 2013), shriveling and cell breakdown, which resulted in cortical cell shape loss in Phaseolus aureus (Singh and Agrawal 2007) and reduced cortical thickness in maize roots (Gowayed and Almaghrabi, 2013). Similarly, Cd accumulation in Pteris vittata caused root cortical and endodermal cell breakdown or reduction (Sridhar et al., 2007; Armendariz et al., 2016). Heavy metals can affect the balance of root hormones, affecting cel lular tissue differentiation and the number of cells in these tissues (Sandalio et al., 2001). Furthermore, the increased number of tracheary elements and decreased metaxylem area alter water storage capacity. Larger diameter vessels are more productive but less safe, leading to an increased risk of blisters (Dickison, 2000).\nfrontiersin.org\nMoreover, Thalassia hemprichii exposed to Pb had wider cortical air spaces, and rising Pb concentration increased exodermal and endodermal cell wall thickness (Tupan and Azrianingsih, 2016). Cu promoted endodermal cell wall thickening in the bean (Bouazizi et al., 2010) and exposure separated the vascular bundles and pith regions (Talukdar, 2013).\nEven though xylem conduits are tight and less susceptible to damage due to lignification, breakdown, loss of shape, or change in diameter have been observed in Cicer arietinum roots after Cr stress (Mondal et al., 2013). Lignin deposition in cortical cell walls can aid in the repairs of root turgescence by reducing water loss from the root via refluxas an adaptive mechanism that aids in root architecture stability (Hose et al., 2001).\nHere, Cd strongly induced stomatal closure and decreased stomatal conductance in pea leaves. In line with these findings, several studies have found that Cd strongly induces stomatal closure in different plant species (Sun et al., 2016; Sadeghipour, 2018). Stomata closed individually under Cd stress, regardless of water status. Furthermore, Cd caused stomatal closure as a result of Cd entry into the guard cells, and it reduced the number of stomata per unit area (Ismael et al., 2019). Cd toxicity reduced stomatal conductance and cell division (Abbas et al., 2017). The following mechanisms of Si inhibition of metal transport in plants have been proposed: (1) thickening Casparian strips (2) depositing lignin in the cell walls and (3) depositing Si in the cell (Shi et al., 2005; Da Cunha and Do Nascimento, 2009)."

Plants exposed to Cd toxicity showed reduced growth, which was correlated with Cd accumulation and reduced chlorophyll and primary metabolites such as sugars and protein. Additionally, Cd significantly oxidative damage (MDA and H2O2), and to cope with stress plants increased their enzyme activity (CAT, POD) compared to controls. Higher Cd concentrations appear to cause anatomical abnormalities such as a distinct vascular system, abnormal lignification in the pith parenchyma, and enlarged cortical cells, according to our findings. The use of Si effectively reduced the oxidative burst caused by Cd toxicity. Therefore, we recommend using Si at 300 ppm as a promising approach to reduce Cd toxicity\nFrontiers in Plant Science 17"
