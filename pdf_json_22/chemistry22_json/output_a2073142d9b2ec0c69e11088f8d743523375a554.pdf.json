The essential role of the ArnA dehydrogenase domain (ArnA_DH) in the addition of 4-amino-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) to lipid A makes it a potential target in polymyxin adjuvant design. Purpose: This study aimed to identify a dehydrogenase inhibitor that enhances the antibacterial effect of polymyxin B (PB) and to further understand the mechanism of this drug combination. Methods: A susceptible K. pneumoniae strain, ATCC13883, was used to screen a dehydrogenase inhibitor library based on 3-(4,5)- dimethylthiazol(-z-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and chequerboard assays. The protein- and cell-based effects of disulfiram (DSF) on ArnA activity were assessed, and the transcription levels of genes in the arn operon were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2013PCR). Lipid A was isolated, and a structural analysis was performed. The cell wall function was evaluated through membrane integrity and bacterial viability assays. The in vivo antibacterial activity was evaluated using a mouse pulmonary infection model. Results: We screened a dehydrogenase inhibitor library and found that the anti-alcoholism drug DSF significantly enhanced the antibacterial activity of PB in vitro and in vivo. The protein-based enzyme activity assay showed that DSF exerted no direct effect on the dehydrogenase activity of ArnA. Treatment with the combination of DSF and PB but not with PB alone decreased both the transcription level of genes in the arn operon and the modification level of lipid A. DSF also strengthened the disruption of the cell membrane integrity of PB. Moreover, the enhanced PB antibacterial activity was effective against clinical PB-resistant strains. Conclusion: We identified a new drug combination that can be used to reduce the necessary dosage of PB and overcome PB resistance, and this drug combination has good prospects for clinical application.

An increase in the colistin resistance rate has been reported among multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, particularly among carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CR-KP) isolates.7 Outbreaks caused by carbapenem- and colistin-resistant isolates have also been reported in North America and Europe.7 Therefore, strategies to lower the dosage of polymyxin needed to clear resistant gram-negative infections are actively sought.\nA complementary strategy for protecting existing drugs involves the use of antibiotic combinations and antibiotic adjuvants.8\u201311 Antibiotic combinations are beneficial because synergistic interactions are achieved through a variety of mechanisms, such as targeting distinct steps in common or linked biochemical pathways, enhancing uptake, and suppressing efflux. Synergistic effects can result in faster killing times or enhanced killing and thereby limit the opportunity for the emergence of resistant.12 In contrast to antibiotic combinations, antibiotic adjuvants show little or no antimicrobial activity alone. However, when combined with antibiotics, these adjuvants enhance antibiotic activity under specific conditions.13 The majority of polymyxin resistance mechanisms involve modifications that alter the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure and charge.14 One such modification is the addition of L-Ara4N to lipid A, which abrogates the initial charge-based interaction with the positively charged amino groups of polymyxin.14 ArnA, which is the first enzyme specific to the lipid A-Ara4N pathway, contains a dehydrogenase domain (ArnA_DH) that catalyzes the \u03b2-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) and a transformylase domain that formylates UDP-Ara4N.15\u201317 The essential role of ArnA in the addition of Ara4N to lipid A makes it an excellent potential target in polymyxin adjuvant design.\nIn view of the important role of ArnA_DH in lipid A-Ara4N synthesis, we launched a whole-cell screening program to search for inhibitors that target ArnA_DH using a dehydrogenase inhibitor library. The clinically used anti-alcoholism drug disulfiram (DSF), which acts as an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor,12 was selected because it exhibited the strongest synergistic effect with PB against K. pneumoniae. Surprisingly, the enhancement effect of DSF on the antibacterial activity of PB does not appear to be achieved by the inhibition of dehydrogenases such as ArnA but by inhibition of the transcription level of genes associated with lipid A-Ara4N synthesis. Our study demonstrates the possibility of developing the combination of PB and DSF and reveals that DSF likely has a novel mechanism of action in bacteria."

            "text": "Compound Library and Screening Strategy A dehydrogenase inhibitor library was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). All bacterial strains used in this study were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 \u00b0C. PB (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, USA) and inhibitors at twofold serial dilutions were prepared in 50 \u03bcL of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB) in each well of 96-well plates. An aliquot of K. pneumoniae ATCC13883 (KP13883) culture (50 \u03bcL) was then added to each well to obtain an OD600 of 0.006. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited 90% of bacterial growth determined by the MTT assay (MCE, USA).\nCombinations of compounds and PB were prepared in 96-well plates to obtain a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM compound and 1/4 \u00d7 MIC PB in 50 \u03bcL of LB per well. An aliquot of KP13883 culture (50 \u03bcL) was then added to each well of the 96- well plate to obtain an OD600 of 0.006. After overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, primary hits were identified as those showing 90% bacterial growth inhibition. Drug interactions were assessed through a checkerboard titration assay. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) was calculated using the following formula: (MIC of drug A or B in combination)/(MIC of drug A or B alone). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was the sum of the two FICs (\u01a9FIC). The combination was considered synergistic if \u01a9FIC \u2264 0.5, unrelated if 4 \u2265 \u01a9FIC > 0.5, and antagonistic if \u01a9FIC > 4.18\nGrowth Curves of Bacteria A single colony of KP13883 was cultured in 3 mL of LB broth overnight at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 230 rpm. The overnight cultures were then diluted 1:100 in fresh medium supplemented with 100 \u00b5M DSF, 0.5 \u00b5g/mL PB or the combination of DSF with PB and cultured at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 230 rpm. The growth curves at 37 \u00b0C were recorded by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm at intervals of 30 or 60 min.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S342641 DovePress Infection and Drug Resistance 2022:15296\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nProtein Expression and Purification cDNA for full-length ArnA was chemically synthesized with the aim of optimizing its expression in Escherichia coli. The cDNA sequence was cloned into the protein expression vector pET28b. The plasmid was then transformed into the E. coli BL-21 strain for recombinant protein expression. The BL-21 strain carrying the aforementioned plasmid was grown in LB medium at 37 \u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.4. The medium was then supplemented with 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the induced cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C for 4 hours.\nTo purify the recombinant proteins, the cells were harvested and lysed by ultrasonication. The supernatant of the lysed cells was loaded onto Ni-NTA columns (Qiagen, Germany), and the proteins were purified using a gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare, USA) with gel-filtration buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mM DTT). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method.\nProtein- or Cell-Based Effects of DSF on Enzyme Activity To assess its protein-based effects, KP13883 was cultured to an OD600 of 0.6. The bacteria from 1 mL of culture were harvested (12,000 rpm, 5 min), and total proteins were extracted using B-PER Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher, USA). Total protein (0.1 mg) or 12 \u03bcg of ArnA recombinant protein was treated in the presence or absence of DSF (7.4 \u03bcg/mL) and added to a reaction mixture containing 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mg/mL BSA, 10% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM NAD+, and 1 mM UDP-GlcA. The enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to production of the reduced form of NAD (NADH) for 20 min. All enzyme assays were performed at 37 \u00b0C in a final volume of 800 \u03bcL. The changes in NADH reflect UDP-GlcAspecific dehydrogenase activity.\nFor the assessment of cell-based effects, KP13883 cells were cultured to an OD600 of 0.6 in the presence or absence of 7.4 \u03bcg/mL DSF. The enzyme activity of 2 mg of total protein was tested.\nQuantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT\u2013PCR) Total RNA was extracted and purified using an RNAprep Pure Bacteria Kit (Tiangen, China). Reverse transcription and qPCR were performed using RT Master Mix for qPCR (MCE, USA) and SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (MCE, USA) with 16S rRNA as the internal control. The primers used in the study are listed in Table S1.\nIsolation and Structural Analysis of Lipid A Mild-acid hydrolysis was used for lipid A extraction, as previously described.19 In brief, a single colony of KP13883 was cultured in 1 mL of LB broth overnight at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 230 rpm. The bacteria were inoculated into fresh LB medium with or without DSF (10 \u00b5g/mL), PB (0.75 \u00b5g/mL) or the combination of DSF (10 \u00b5g/mL) with PB (0.75 \u00b5g/mL) and shaken to an OD600 of 0.6\u20130.8. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the cells were washed with PBS. An LPS extraction kit (iNtRON, Korea) was used for LPS extraction and purification. Ten milliliters of lysis buffer was added to each sample, and the mixture was vortexed vigorously. Each sample was added to 4 mL of chloroform, vortexed vigorously for 30 sec, and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, and 8 mL of the supernatant was then transferred to a new 50-mL centrifuge tube. Subsequently, 16 mL of purification buffer was added to the supernatant and mixed. The samples were incubated at \u221220 \u00b0C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the LPS pellet was washed with 20 mL of 70% ethanol and dried. Lipid Awas hydrolyzed from LPS by incubation for 1 h at 100 \u00b0C in 5.4 mL of lysis buffer (pH 4.5) containing 50 mM acetic acid-sodium acetate and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The sample was cooled to room temperature, and chloroform (6 mL) and methanol (6 mL) were then added. The mixture was inverted, mixed and centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7g for 10 min. The upper phase was collected, and 6 mL of the lower phase of the pre-equilibrated two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture (chloroform:methanol:water; 2:2:1.8 v/v) was added. The sample was then centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7g for 10 min. The lower phase was collected, and 22.8 mL of the upper phase of the pre-equilibrated two-phase BlighDyer mixture was added. The sample was then centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7g for 10 min. The lower phase was collected, dried at\nInfection and Drug Resistance 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S342641 DovePress\n297\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nroom temperature, and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. The structural analysis of lipid A was performed using a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) in the negative mode.20,21\nMembrane Integrity Assay The KP13883 cultures were washed, resuspended in saline (0.01 M), and standardized to an OD600 of 0.5. Propidium iodide (PI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a concentration of 10 nM was added in the presence or absence of DSF or PB. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, the fluorescence was measured with an excitation wavelength of 535 nm and an emission wavelength of 615 nm.\nBacterial Viability Assay The effect of DSF on bacterial viability was evaluated using a LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Invitrogen, USA). The KP13883 cultures were washed, resuspended in saline (0.01 M), and standardized to an OD600 of 0.1. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of DSF (100 \u03bcg/mL) and/or PB (2 \u03bcg/mL), the bacteria were harvested, washed, and resuspended in saline. SYTO9 (1.67 mM, 1.5 \u03bcL) and PI (10 mM, 1.5 \u03bcL) were added to each sample to obtain a final volume of 1 mL and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. The stained bacteria were imaged using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8).\nMouse Pulmonary Infection Model A pneumonia model of clinical PB-resistant K. pneumoniae (P2418-1) in mice was used to test the antibacterial activity of the drug combination. Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice raised under specific pathogen-free conditions were purchased from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. The mice were intraperitoneally anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (75 mg/kg) and inoculated with 1.0\u00d7107 colony-forming units (CFUs) of K. pneumoniae in BALB/c noninvasive intratracheal instillation under direct vision. Two hours after infection, the drugs were administered via intraperitoneal injection; the treatments of PB and DSF alone were administered at doses of 0.2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, and the combination treatments consisted of 0.2 mg/kg PB and 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg DSF. The survival of the mice was observed for 7 days post-infection.\nEthical Statement All animal care and use protocols in this study were performed in compliance with the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals approved by the State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China. All animal experiments in this study were approved by the Animal Ethical and Experimental Committee of the Army Military Medical University (Chongqing, approval No. 2011-04) in accordance with their rules and regulations.\nData Availability We deposited the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of K. pneumonia clinical strains (P2445-4, AH1313-1, P2418-1, and P1291-19) in GenBank under BioProject PRJNA517992.\nStatistical Analyses Unpaired two-sided Student\u2019s t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for analyses of the transcription level, enzyme activity and lipid A modification level. Log-rank Mantel\u2013Cox test was used for survival analysis. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical processes were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA)."

At a concentration of 100 \u03bcM, no dehydrogenase inhibitors inhibited 90% of bacterial growth, but 5 promising\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S342641 DovePress Infection and Drug Resistance 2022:15298\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\ndrug combination pairs with \u01a9FIC \u2264 0.5 were identified by chequerboard titration (Table 1). Among these combinations, the strongest synergistic effect was observed with DSF and PB (\u01a9FIC \u2264 0.25). The growth curve showed that the combination of PB and DSF significantly inhibited bacterial growth (Supplementary Figure 1). This synergistic effect was also observed in clinical PB-resistant strains (Table 2). In addition, we found that diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), the initial product of DSF metabolism in vivo, exerted no synergistic effect with PB (Table 2).\nEffect of DSF on ArnA Enzyme Activity Based on the synergistic effect of DSF on PB, we speculated that DSF may play a role by inhibiting the dehydrogenase activity of ArnA. However, the results of the spectrophotometric assay showed that ArnA activity was not affected by DSF (Figure 1A), which was not consistent with our hypothesis.\nEffect of DSF on the Transcription Level of Genes Associated with Lipid A Modification We then tested the effect of DSF on the transcription level of genes belonging to the arnBCADTEF operon (also known as pmrHFIJKLM), which encodes the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of Ara4N precursors and its transfer to lipid A.14 The results showed that the transcription levels of arnA, arnB, arnC, arnE, arnF and arnT were significantly decreased after DSF treatment (Figure 1B). It is logical that the transcription of arnA is synchronized with the transcription of other genes in the same operon, which suggests that the synergistic effect of DSF on PB is achieved by inhibiting the transcription of the arn operon rather than by inhibiting the dehydrogenase activity of ArnA.\nEffect of DSF on the UDP-GlcA-Specific Dehydrogenase Activity of Total Protein To identify the phase of action of DSF, we assessed the UDP-GlcA-specific dehydrogenase activity on total protein. UDP-GlcA-specific dehydrogenase activity was not affected by direct treatment of total protein with DSF. In contrast, the addition of DSF to the bacterial culture significantly reduced the enzyme activity of total protein, which indicated that DSF did not inhibit activity by directly acting on the enzyme (Figure 1C).\nEffect of DSF on the Lipid A Modifications of K. pneumoniae To investigate whether the inhibition of arn operon transcription could eventually prevent lipid A modification, we measured the proportion of modified lipid A from K. pneumoniae by LC\u2013MS/MS. Different forms of modification, including the addition of Ara4N to the 1\u2019 or 4\u2019 phosphate (or both), were found (Figure 1D and Tables S2 and S3). The combinations of PB and DSF decreased the L-Ara4N-lipid A conjugates compared with the levels obtained with PB alone (m/z 1841.24 and m/z 2063.47) (Figure 1D).\nEffect of DSF on Membrane Integrity As shown in Figure 2, we found that DSF had no effect on the integrity of the cell membrane. However, the combination of DSF and PB resulted in increased cell membrane disruption compared with that obtained with PB alone.\nDSF Enhanced the Activity of PB in vivo To evaluate the clinical value of the combination of DSF and PB, we selected a clinical strain of PB-resistant K. pneumoniae (P2418-1, MIC = 16 \u03bcg/mL) for in vivo testing. Seven days after infection, the survival rates of the mice treated with PB (0.2 mg/kg, 30% survival rate) or DSF (10 mg/kg, 0% survival rate) alone were lower than those of the mice treated with a combination therapy (0.2 mg/kg PB + 5 or 10 mg/kg DSF; 60% survival rates) (Figure 3). Consistent with the in vitro results, DSF showed no antibacterial activity in vivo at 10 mg/kg.\nInfection and Drug Resistance 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S342641 DovePress\n299\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S342641 DovePress Infection and Drug Resistance 2022:15300\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

            "text": "Because the primary interaction of polymyxins with the bacterial surface occurs via charge-based interactions with LPS, it is not surprising that the activity of polymyxins can be enhanced by promoting their binding to LPS. A good example of this phenomenon is that novobiocin enhances polymyxin activity by stimulating LPS transport.22 The controlled addition of positively charged residues, such as Ara4N, to LPS results in a reduced negative charge on the bacterial surface and therefore reduces the interaction between polymyxin and LPS.23 High-level polymyxin resistance due to the addition of Ara4N has been found in many bacterial clinical isolates.24\u201326 This finding suggests that inhibiting the modification of lipid A is an effective strategy for developing polymyxin adjuvants. ArnA dehydrogenase belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of enzymes that catalyze the NAD+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-GlcA to UDP-4-keto-pentose,16,27 and this enzyme plays a crucial role in the pathway through which lipid A is modified with Ara4N, which leads to antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria.28 In this study, we aimed to identify compounds\nNotes: \u2211FIC, sum of the fractional inhibitory concentration; \u2211FIC \u2264 0.5 indicates synergism; 4 \u2265 \u2211FIC > 0.5 indicates indifference; and \u01a9FIC > 4 indicates antagonism.

DSF treatment downregulated the transcription of genes in the arn operon and inhibited the Ara4N modification of lipid A. Our\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S342641 DovePress Infection and Drug Resistance 2022:15302\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nstudy once again demonstrated that the identification of lipid A modification inhibitors is an effective method for identifying PB synergistic agents. However, as shown in Figure 1D, 1797.21, 1813.21 and 1825.25 Da did not show the expected difference between PB and PB combined with DSF, which might be due to the difference between the absolute amounts of different lipid A forms. In this study, we found the ratio between all detected lipid A and corresponding modified forms. In fact, 1797.21, 1813.21 and 1825.25 Da is not high in terms of the overall absolute amount; thus, the low absolute amounts might be responsible for the unexpected result. In other words, because the total absolute amount is low, the difference might have a lower impact on the final drug-resistant phenotype of the bacteria.\nAlthough we confirmed that DSF inhibits the transcription levels of genes belonging to the arn operon, the main limitation of our study is that the compound that directly interacts with DSF was not identified. The synergistic effect of DSF toward PB did not occur through its metabolites, such as DTC, which suggests that DSF did not act through the\nInfection and Drug Resistance 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S342641 DovePress\n303\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\npreviously reported mechanism32 and that DSF may have as-yet unidentified targets in bacteria. In K. pneumoniae, the transcription level of the arn operon is mainly regulated by two-component systems (TCSs), such as PmrAB and PhoPQ.33,34 Moreover, regulators of PmrAB and PhoPQ, such as MgrB and CrrAB, and the intrinsic regulator RamA are also involved in regulating the modification of lipid.35,36 Therefore, all of the above-mentioned factors have potential as DSF targets and deserve further investigation.\nThe combination of DSF and PB was found to be effective against clinical PB-resistant strains. The safety profile of DSF, which has been used clinically for over six decades, underscores the promise of DSF and PB combination therapy for clinical application.37 Moreover, the animal experiments performed in this study verified that DSF enables PB to play an antibacterial role at low concentrations, which is significant for obtaining reduced side effects."
