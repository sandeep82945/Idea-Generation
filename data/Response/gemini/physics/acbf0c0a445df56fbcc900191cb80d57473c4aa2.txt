1. **Investigate the use of other soft-sensor modeling techniques:** The paper uses principal component regression (PCR) for soft-sensor modeling. Other techniques, such as partial least squares regression (PLS) or artificial neural networks (ANNs), could also be explored to determine if they can provide better estimation accuracy.


2. **Apply the proposed control scheme to other distillation columns:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme on a simulated methanol-water separation column. It would be beneficial to apply the scheme to other distillation columns, with different configurations and operating conditions, to assess its generalizability.


3. **Investigate the use of the proposed control scheme for other control objectives:** The paper focuses on using the proposed control scheme for product composition control. It would be interesting to investigate its application to other control objectives, such as temperature control or pressure control, to determine its versatility.


4. **Develop a systematic approach for selecting the optimal soft-sensor model and control parameters:** The paper does not provide a systematic approach for selecting the optimal soft-sensor model and control parameters. Developing such an approach would help practitioners to implement the proposed control scheme more effectively.


5. **Investigate the use of the proposed control scheme in a real-world industrial setting:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme through simulation studies. It would be valuable to implement the scheme in a real-world industrial setting to evaluate its performance under actual operating conditions.
