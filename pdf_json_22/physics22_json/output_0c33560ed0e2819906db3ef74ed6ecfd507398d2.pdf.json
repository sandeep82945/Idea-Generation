    "abstractText": "In quantum metrology, one typically creates correlations among atoms or photons to enhance measurement precision. Here, we show how one can use other excitations to perform quantum-enhanced measurements on the example of center-of-mass excitations of a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate and a Coulomb crystal. We also present a method to simulate a homodyne detection of cent er-of-mass excitations in these systems, which is required for optimal estimation.",

INTRODUCTION\nQuantum metrology relies on exploiting nonclassical correlations between system constituents to overcome the standard quantum limit of precision when estimating an unknown parameter [1,2]. In typical situations, these correlations are being created among atoms [3] or photons [4,5] which are subsequently used to imprint the information about the unknown parameter. Then, the final state of the system is measured, and the resulting measurement outcomes are used to estimate the parameter. Unfortunately, in some cases, obtaining a suitable correlated state of atoms or photons might be challenging, hindering the possibility of performing quantumenhanced measurements. However, atoms and photons do not exhaust the set of possible excitations among which the correlations could be generated and potentially used [6\u201310].\nLet us, for example, consider a single atom in a harmonic trap for which it seems impossible to create quantum correlations for metrological purposes. Nevertheless, if the harmonic trap has a very high frequency, the wavefunction of the atom will be very localized, which reduces the uncertainty in position. Such squeezing of the uncertainty is known to enhance the precision of measurement in the context of photons [11]; unfortunately, most of the forces that one would want to measure do not couple to the center-of-mass motion (except gravity), but to the atomic internal degrees of freedom, thus exploiting the center-of-mass motion and its excitations might seem, in many cases, metrologically useless.\nTo overcome this apparent limitation, one could couple the center-of-mass motion of an atom with its internal degree of freedom (for example, via spin-orbit coupling) and potentially transfer the information from an atom whose internal structure\n*karol.gietka@uibk.ac.at\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Then the precision of such estimation should scale with the number of center-of-mass excitations which for a very squeezed state might be very large even for a single atom. A similar approach is typically exploited in light-matter systems. There, some force affects an ensemble of atoms, and due to the light-matter interactions, the state of the light is also affected by that force [12\u201314]. Performing the quadrature measurements on the light usually allows one to estimate the strength of the force. In this case, the precision scales typically with the number of field excitations (photons).\nIn this manuscript, on the example of center-of-mass excitations, we show how one can harness less obvious excitations in quantum-enhanced measurements in analogy to light-matter systems. To this end, we consider an adiabatic protocol involving a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate and a (sudden) quench protocol involving a Coulomb crystal. We also show how one can simulate a homodyne detection of center-of-mass excitations in these systems which is required for optimal estimation."

            "text": "A spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate is a system in which atoms are coupled to different momenta depending on their spin state. Although it is well understood [15] and has been realized experimentally [16,17], its metrological potential remains unexplored. In the simplest possible case of a two-mode noninteracting condensate, the behavior of each atom can be described by the following single-particle Hamiltonian (we set h\u0304 = 1 throughout the entire manuscript)\nH\u0302 = ( p\u0302 + k\u03c3\u0302z ) 2\n2m + m\u03c9\n2x\u03022\n2 + 2 \u03c3\u0302x (1)\nwhere x\u0302 and p\u0302 \u2261 \u2212i\u2202x are position and momentum operators of an atom, \u03c9 is the frequency of the harmonic trap, m is the atomic mass, is the atomic frequency, \u03c3\u0302i are the standard\n2643-1564/2022/4(4)/043074(9) 043074-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nPauli matrices, and k is the spin-orbit interaction strength. Depending on the strength of the coupling between the two modes of the condensate , one can distinguish two phases. The single minimum phase is characterized by > 2k2/m, and a double minimum phase (stripe phase) is characterized by < 2k2/m.\nFor the sake of comparison with light-matter systems, we can now rotate Hamiltonian (1) and rewrite it in the form of a quantum Rabi model using the annihilation and creation operators of the harmonic oscillator\nH\u0302 = \u03c9a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 + 2\n\u03c3\u0302z + k \u221a \u03c9\n2m (a\u0302 + a\u0302\u2020)\u03c3\u0302x. (2)\nIn other words, a noninteracting spin-orbit coupled BoseEinstein condensate of N atoms trapped in a harmonic potential is equivalent to N indistinguishable copies of a quantum Rabi model with critical coupling strength kc = \u221a m/2. The latter has been extensively studied in the context of lightmatter interactions [18,19] and (critical) quantum metrology [20\u201324].\nLet us now discuss an equilibrium protocol which relies on adiabatic preparation of the ground state of the system in the single minimum phase [20]. For the sake of brevity, we assume now that is an unknown parameter, and we can control all other parameters to an arbitrary extent. In order to find the ground state (in a suitable form), we can apply the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation [25]\nU\u0302 = exp ( i k\nkc\n\u221a \u03c9\n2 \u221a (a\u0302 + a\u0302\u2020)\u03c3\u0302y\n) , (3)\nand for 1 \u2212 k2/k2c (\u03c9/ )2/3 rewrite the Hamiltonian as (see Appendix A for details)\nH\u0302 \u2248 \u03c9a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 + 2 \u03c3\u0302z + k2 \u03c9 2m (a\u0302 + a\u0302\u2020)2\u03c3\u0302z, (4) whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum coupled to the spin down state |\u03c8\u3009 = S\u0302(\u03be )|0\u3009 \u2297 |\u2193 \u3009 with S\u0302(\u03be ) \u2261 exp{(\u03be/2)(a\u0302\u2020)2 \u2212 (\u03be \u2217/2)a\u03022} being the squeeze operator with \u03be = \u2212 14 ln{1 \u2212 (k/kc)2}. We can now use this ground state to calculate the quantum Fisher information I = \u3008\u2202 \u03c8 |\u2202 \u03c8\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03c8 |\u2202 \u03c8\u30092 which is related to the sensitivity of estimating an unknown parameter through the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound 2 1/NI [26] with N being the number of system copies. The quantum Fisher information becomes\nI = 1 8 2 ( 1 \u2212 k2k2c )2 k 4 k4c . (5)\nSince the ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, which is entirely characterized by the width of the distribution (a consequence of Gaussianity), the measurement that leads to such Fisher information is the measurement of the second moment of position (or momentum) [27,28]. The above expression tells us, in fact, how distinguishable neighboring ground states (as a function of k) are [29]. In order to make a metrological sense out of this expression, we now assume that the coupling was adiabatically changed from k = 0 to k = k f < kc which took time [20] Tk f \u2248 (2\u03b3\u03c9 \u221a 1 \u2212 k2f /k2c )\u22121 where \u03b3 1. Here we see the effect of critical slowing down;\nincreasing k towards kc closes the energy gap which means that preparation time also has to increase. Plugging this time into the expression for the quantum Fisher information yields\nI = 8 \u03c9 2\n2 \u03b3 2\u3008n\u0302\u30092T 2k f , (6)\nwhere \u3008n\u0302\u3009 = sinh2 \u03be \u2248 (4 \u221a\n1 \u2212 k2f /k2c )\u22121 is the average number of center-of-mass excitations [30]. Thus, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound becomes\n2 (\n8N \u03c92\n2 \u03b3 2\u3008n\u0302\u30092T 2k f\n)\u22121 (7)\nand exhibits a Heisenberg scaling with respect to the centerof-mass excitations (similar scalings can be shown for other parameters of the system). Note that such a scaling is consistent with known results for a squeezed vacuum state [31].\nThe above expression for the quantum Fisher information (and Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound) is valid as long as 1 \u2212 k2/k2c (\u03c9/ )2/3; in order to check what happens once this condition is no longer satisfied, we have to perform numerical calculations. These are presented in Fig. 1 where we calculate the number of excitations, quantum Fisher information, and the normalized energy gap /\u03c9 as a function of 1 \u2212 k2/k2c for a fixed \u03c9/ using the Hamiltonian (1) (see also Appendix A). As can be seen in Fig. 1, once the condition\n043074-2\n1 \u2212 k2/k2c (\u03c9/ )2/3 is no longer satisfied, the state does not change anymore and the number of excitations [Fig. 1(a)], quantum Fisher information [Fig. 1(b)], and the energy gap [Fig. 1(c)] does not alter.\nThe above results prove that adiabatic preparation of the groundstate of a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate can, in principle, lead to sensitivities exhibiting Heisenberg scaling with the number of center-of-mass excitations without exploiting any correlations between the atoms. In practice, however, overcoming the standard quantum limit with an adiabatic approach might be substantially limited due to the critical slowing down effect. This is caused by the fact that during adiabatic dynamics, the (squeezed) excitations are created very slowly\u2014and thus ineffectively\u2014as we are closing the energy gap while increasing k towards kc. In order to remove the problem of critical slowing down, one can perform a fast quench beyond the transition point kc to increase the rate at which the excitations are being created and thus make an advantage out of closing the energy gap. Although one can apply the sudden quench protocol to the spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate, in order to show the generality of using center-of-mass excitations, we will now demonstrate this mechanism on the example of a Coulomb crystal."

            "text": "A Coulomb crystal [32] is a crystal-like system composed of cold ions which can serve as a quantum simulator. For example, in a recent experiment [33] a Coulomb crystal in the presence of an external transverse field was used to engineer a simulator of the paradigmatic Dicke Hamiltonian [34]. This was achieved by coupling vibrational modes of the crystal with the spin degree of freedom via a spin-dependent optical dipole force generated by the interference of a pair of lasers. In the presence of an additional transverse field, the system is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian\nH\u0302 = \u2212\u03b4a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 + BS\u0302x \u2212 g\u221a N (a\u0302 + a\u0302\u2020)S\u0302z, (8)\nwhere a\u0302 (a\u0302\u2020) is the annihilation (creation) operator of the center-of-mass excitation, S\u0302i are the collective spin operators, and N is the number of ions. In the above Hamiltonian, \u03b4 \u2261 \u03c9R \u2212 \u03c9 is detuning between the laser frequency \u03c9R and the center-of-mass mode frequency \u03c9, g is the homogeneous coupling between each ion and the center-of-mass mode, and B is the strength of the applied transverse field. Depending on the transverse field strength, one can distinguish two phases. The paramagnetic (normal) phase for B > g2/|\u03b4| \u2261 Bc and the ferromagnetic (superradiant) phase for B < Bc.\nDynamic metrological protocol relies on performing a sudden quench from the single minimum (normal) phase to the double minimum (superradiant) phase [35] and exploits the dynamics of an inverted harmonic oscillator [36]. This provides an exponential speed up with respect to the adiabatic protocol [37]. In the following, we treat \u03b4 as the unknown parameter and change B to perform a quench between the two phases. In order to see the effect of an inverted harmonic\noscillator, we first apply the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation\nU\u0302 = exp (\ni Bc B \u03b4 g \u221a N (a\u0302 + a\u0302\u2020)S\u0302y\n) (9)\nto the Hamiltonian (8) and rewrite it with the help of quadrature operators (see Appendix B)\nH\u0302 = \u03b4 2 P\u03022 + \u03b4 2\n( 1 \u2212 Bc\nB\n) X\u0302 2. (10)\nThe above Hamiltonian describes a harmonic oscillator with a tunable frequency which can become negative. It gives an accurate ground state description only in the paramagnetic phase (B > Bc); as for B < Bc, the ground state does not exist. Nevertheless, this Hamiltonian can be still used to describe quenches from paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase until a certain number of center-of-mass excitations is reached (nmax \u221d NB/\u03b4), and we assume now that this number is not exceeded (see Appendix B).\nIn order to calculate the quantum Fisher information, we assume that the system is quenched from the ground state at B Bc, where the center-of-mass excitations are decoupled from the spin, to some B f < Bc. Unfortunately, apart from dependence on hyperbolic functions (see Appendix C) which reflects the fact that inverted harmonic oscillator dynamics stimulates squeezing, the full expression for quantum Fisher information is complicated and one does not clearly see its advantage. For a special case of B f = Bc/2, one can show that the quantum Fisher information is equal to\nI\u03b4 = B 2 c 2\u03b42B2f sinh4 \u03b4t = 2 \u03b42 \u3008n\u0302\u30092, (11)\nwhere \u3008n\u0302\u3009 = sinh2 \u03b4t is the instantaneous number of centerof-mass excitations. Similarly, as in the case of an adiabatic protocol with a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate, the quantum Fisher information exhibits a Heisenberg scaling with respect to the center-of-mass excitations.\nIn order to inspect what happens once the inverted harmonic oscillator dynamics is no longer valid, we have to resort to numerical calculations. These are presented in Fig. 2, where we can see \u3008X\u0302 2\u3009, \u3008n\u0302\u30092, and I\u03b4 as a function of time after the quench. As can be seen in Fig. 2(b), once the number of excitations does not grow exponentially, the same happens with the quantum Fisher information [Fig. 2(c)] and squeezing [Fig. 2(a)].\nIn the case of a quench protocol, the final state is Gaussian, and the optimal measurement that can lead to saturation of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound is also a homodyne detection, but at an angle that is dependent on time and parameters of the system [37]. Therefore, one needs a method to simulate a homodyne detection at an arbitrary angle for the center-of-mass excitations."

            "text": "In the case of light-matter systems and Gaussian states of light, it is well known that in order to extract the maximum amount of information from the system one has to perform a\n043074-3\nhomodyne measurement in the optimal direction [31], which can be controlled with the phase of the local oscillator. For a Bose-Einstein condensate and a Coulomb crystal, it seems that one is limited to the quadrature measurement in only two directions, namely x\u0302 (X\u0302 ) and p\u0302 (P\u0302). In the following, we will explain how an equivalent of a generalized quadrature operator Q\u0302(\u03b8 ) = x\u0302 cos \u03b8 + p\u0302 sin \u03b8 (\u03b8 is the local oscillator phase) for the center-of-mass excitations could be measured in a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate and a Coulomb crystal. To this end, let us consider Hamiltonian (1) for k = 0. Such a Hamiltonian describes two subsystems that are decoupled. This means that for k = 0, the dynamics of centerof-mass excitations is governed solely by H\u0302 = \u03c9a\u0302\u2020a\u0302. Such a Hamiltonian generates rotations in the quadrature phase space around its origin. Therefore, by performing a sudden quench back to k = 0 after the final state was reached, it is possible to rotate the wavefunction by an arbitrary angle \u03b8 in the phase space and thus perform a measurement of Q\u0302(\u03b8 ) by measuring either momentum or position distribution.\nIn the case of a Coulomb crystal [Hamiltonian (8)], decoupling of the collective spin from the center-of-mass motion can be done by turning off the lasers or, alternatively, quenching the magnetic field back to B Bc after the final state is obtained. Therefore an arbitrary rotation can be performed in the phase space of center-of-mass excitations by exploiting an appropriate parameter quench. Then Q\u0302(\u03b8 ) could be measured\nby inspecting either momentum or position distribution (see Appendix D for a visualization) similarly as in the case of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate."

To this end, we have proposed how to exploit center-of-mass excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate and a Coulomb crystal. We presented two protocols based on an adiabatic and a sudden quench, originally developed for light-matter systems, that could be used to estimate unknown parameters of the system with sensitivities exhibiting Heisenberg scaling with respect to the center-of-mass excitations. We have also presented how one can simulate the measurement of a generalized quadrature operator, which is required for extracting the maximal amount of information about the unknown parameter from these systems. This could be achieved by decoupling the center-of-mass mode from the spin degree of freedom, waiting until the state aligns with the position or momentum axis, and finally measuring its distribution. Then, as the resulting states are Gaussian, the second moment of position and momentum can serve as the optimal estimator.\nIn the case of a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstien condensate, we did not consider any interactions which is justified for dilute gases or can be achieved by the means of Feshbach resonances. In general, small spin-spin repulsive interactions will shift the critical spin-orbit coupling strength to a larger value and change the shape of the wavefunction (it will no longer be Gaussian). This, however, should not prevent using center-of-mass excitations in quantum metrology. The major difference will be the necessity to use the entire distribution of position (or momentum) to construct an optimal estimator.\nIn both cases, we expect that the most relevant source of decoherence will be the finite temperature of the considered systems, which will cause them to occupy incoherently excited states. Nevertheless, it can be shown that while the effective Hamiltonian description is valid, the quantum Fisher information increases with growing temperature (see Appendix E) which is caused by the increased number of excitations in a thermal state. Once the effective harmonic oscillator model is not valid anymore, the quantum Fisher information decreases with increasing temperature. In this case, the entire distribution of position (or momentum) is also required for optimal estimation as the state is no longer Gaussian.\nThe presented protocols could be used in any system that can be mapped to a harmonic oscillator coupled to a (collective) spin; one intriguing example is electrons trapped on the surface of liquid Helium, where the role of the harmonic oscillator is played by Landau levels [38]. We hope that this work will stimulate the search for new metrological protocols (in known and well-understood systems) involving various kinds of excitations that might be more robust to decoherence and losses than atoms or photons. In particular, protocols involving spin-orbit coupled fermionic atoms [39] (or a Tonks-Girardeau gas [40\u201342]) might lead to protocols robust to atom losses and benefiting from both correlated\n043074-4\ncenter-of-mass excitations and naturally existing fermionic correlations [43]."

In order to simulate the homodyne detection, we decouple the center-of-mass mode from the spin degree of freedom after the final state is obtained. Waiting subsequently for a proper amount of time makes it possible to rotate the state in the phase space and align it with the real (position) or imaginary (momentum) axis. Therefore by measuring the distribution of position or momentum, one can measure an arbitrary quadrature.

            "text": "In the main text, we have focused on the zero temperature case where the system resides in its ground state and is described by a pure state. From a practical point of view, however, it is relevant to consider a finite temperature case where the system occupies (incoherently) excited levels as well. In such a case, the state of the system can be described using a density matrix operator (statistical mixture)\n\u03c1\u0302 = \u221e\u2211\nn=0 pn|n\u3009\u3008n|, (E1)\nwhere n labels the excited states and pn is given by\npn = 1 Z exp(\u2212\u03b2En), (E2)\nwhere Z = \u2211n exp(\u2212\u03b2En) is the partition function (statistical sum) with En being the energy of the nth excited state, and \u03b2 = 1/kbT where kb is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. In order to calculate the quantum Fisher information for a statistical mixture, we have to use the following\nformula\nI\u03bb = 2 \u2211 n,m (pn \u2212 pm)2 pn + pm |\u3008n|h\u0302\u03bb|m\u3009| 2.

In panel (a), we plot the quantum Fisher information for the limiting case where \u03c9/ \u2192 0 (solid lines) and for finite \u03c9/ (dashed lines). Interestingly, the quantum Fisher information increases with growing temperature until the maximum amount of squeezing is obtained. Once the plateau is reached, increasing the temperature decreases the quantum Fisher information. This is further illustrated in panel (b), where we plot the quantum Fisher information as a function of temperature for the case where the maximum amount of squeezing has been reached (1 \u2212 k2/k2c = 10\u22125). The (initial) growth of the quantum Fisher information is caused by the increased number of center-of-mass excitations for a thermal state.\nThe results of numerical simulations for the Coulomb crystal are presented in Fig 7. Similarly as in Fig. 6, in panel (a) we plot the quantum Fisher information for the limiting case where NB/\u03b4 \u2192 0 (solid lines) and for finite NB/\u03b4 (dashed lines). The quantum Fisher information increases (again) with growing temperature until the inverted harmonic oscillator picture is no longer applicable. Once quantum Fisher information does not grow exponentially anymore, the effect of\n043074-7\nincreased temperature decreases the quantum Fisher information. The growth of the quantum Fisher information is further illustrated in panel (b), where we plot the quantum Fisher\ninformation as a function of temperature for the case when the inverted harmonic oscillator picture is still valid (without the loss of generality, we choose \u03b4t = 4 point).\n[1] V.
