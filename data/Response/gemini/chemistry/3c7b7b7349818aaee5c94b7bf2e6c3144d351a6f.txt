1. **Investigate the effect of different olive storage conditions on the composition and oxidative stability of 'Corbella' EVOOs.** This could involve varying the storage temperature, duration, and atmosphere to determine the optimal conditions for preserving the antioxidant compounds and oxidative stability of the oil.
2. **Examine the relationship between the concentration of secoiridoids, particularly oleacein and oleocanthal, and the oxidative stability of 'Corbella' EVOOs.** This could involve analyzing the correlation between these compounds and oxidative stability parameters, such as Rancimat values and DPPH radical scavenging activity.
3. **Explore the synergistic effect between secoiridoids and carotenoids on the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of 'Corbella' EVOOs.** This could involve studying the combined effect of these compounds on oxidative stability parameters and investigating the underlying mechanisms responsible for their synergistic interaction.
4. **Evaluate the impact of malaxation conditions on the formation and degradation of secoiridoids in 'Corbella' olives.** This could involve analyzing the changes in secoiridoid levels during different malaxation temperatures and times to determine the optimal conditions for maximizing their production and stability.
5. **Investigate the effect of 'Corbella' EVOOs with enhanced oxidative stability on the shelf life and sensory quality of food products.** This could involve incorporating the EVOOs into different food products and monitoring their oxidative stability and sensory attributes over time to assess their potential for extending shelf life and improving product quality.
