The virus is neurotropic and can cause an inflammatory response in the body [9\u201311], leading to various neurological injuries and even death [12, 13].\nThere are many reports on the common clinical symptoms of infection by the EV-A71 virus in China [14\u201316], but there are few reports on the timing of onset and symptoms of children with severe EV-A71 infection, easily leading to misdiagnosis or misjudgment by clinicians, especially in rural hospitals, resulting in delayed treatment, improper treatment, or overtreatment.\nTherefore, this study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of children with severe EV-A71 infection."

They were 1\u201313 years of age. The symptoms were fever in 94 patients (93.1%), rash in 46 (45.5%), irritability in 70 (69.3%), and lethargy in 56 (55.4%). There were 19 (59.3%) patients with abnormal neurological magnetic resonance imaging [pontine tegmentum (n = 14, 43.8%), medulla oblongata (n = 11, 34.4%), midbrain (n = 9, 28.1%), cerebellum and dentate nucleus (n = 8, 25.0%), basal ganglia (n = 4, 12.5%), cortex (n = 4, 12.5%), spinal cord (n = 3, 9.3%), and meninges (n = 1, 3.1%)]. There was a positive correlation between the ratio of neutrophil count and white blood cell count in cerebrospinal fluid in the first 3 days of the disease (r = 0.415, P < 0.001).\nConclusion The clinical symptoms of EV-A71 infection are fever and/or skin rash, irritability, and lethargy. Some patients have abnormal neurological magnetic resonance imaging. The white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid of children with EV-A71 infection may increase alongside neutrophil counts.\nKeywords Enterovirus, Nervous system, Cerebrospinal fluid, Imaging, Symptoms, Retrospective study"

            "text": "This study showed that fever and rash tended to appear earlier during severe EV-A71 infection, followed by irritability and lethargy, which might be related to the infection mechanism. Indeed, EV-A71 enters the human body through the mouth, initially replicates in the pharynx (tonsils) or intestinal tract, and then multiplies in the regional lymph nodes, which can cause mild viremia [18\u201320]. The illness of most patients can be controlled at this stage. In some infected people, the virus continues to invade the reticuloendothelial tissue, deep lymph nodes, liver, spleen, bone marrow, skin, mucous membranes, central nervous system, and heart, and further proliferate and cause corresponding lesions [21]. Generally, the symptoms of systemic viremia, such as fever and rash, appear first after viral replication through the respiratory\nor gastrointestinal tract. If the disease continues to progress, the nervous system can be impaired, leading to irritability and lethargy.\nIn this study, irritability usually appeared on the 1st to 4th day, especially on the 2nd or 3rd day. The essence of irritability is myoclonus, divided into myoclonus from the corticothalamic axis and subcutaneous non-epileptic myoclonus originating from the back of the pons. Considering that no epilepsy waves were found in the scalp EEG of the included children and MRI lesions were more common in the dorsal pons, irritability may be from myoclonus caused by the release of 5-HT from the dorsal pons (predominant raphe nucleus) [22]. Lethargy mostly occurred after the fever subsided and after irritability, mainly on the 3rd or 4th day, and lasted for 1\u20132 days. Impairment of the cortical or ascending reticular activation system can reduce consciousness [23\u201325]. Still, most children had normal EEG without obvious cognitive dysfunction during the recovery period, suggesting likely non-specific projection system damage of the ascending reticular activation system in the upper pons or lower part of the midbrain, leading to lethargy.\nAmong the 101 children included, two died. None of the remaining children entered the stage of pre-cardiopulmonary or cardiopulmonary failure. Nevertheless, the frequencies of irritability and lethargy were 69.3% and 55.4%, respectively, suggesting that irritability and lethargy are common clinical manifestations of central nervous system involvement in most children with severe EV-A71 infection. In recent years, with the use of immunoglobulin, the number of cases of limb weakness has decreased compared with early studies. Limb weakness mostly occurred after the 4th day and resulted from the anterior horn of the spinal cord being invaded by the virus. The two cases of death due to cardiopulmonary failure occurred in the first 3 days of the course of\nthe disease, mostly without skin rash. Considering that the lesions involved the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus of the solitary tract, or the inner acceleration center or vasoconstriction center of the reticular structure [26, 27], it is possible that the lesions were caused by sympathetic excitation.\nMRI was performed on 32 patients in this study. The lesions involved pontine tegmentum (43.8%), medulla oblongata (34.3%), midbrain (28.1%), cerebellum and dentate nucleus (25.0%), basal ganglia (12.5%), cortex (12.5%), spinal cord (9.3%), and meninges (3.1%), consistent with the pattern reported by Lee et al. [28]. In this study, the incidence of radiographic infection sites was consistent with the incidence of the corresponding clinical manifestations in children: irritability (raphe nucleus), lethargy (ascending reticular activation system), ataxia (cerebellum and dental nucleus), limb weakness (anterior horn of the spinal cord), seizures (cortical) and meningeal irritation (meningeal).\nSixty-three patients underwent CSF examination within 3 days of the onset of the disease. The proportion of neutrophils was positively correlated with the white blood cell count in CSF within 3 days of the onset of the disease, suggesting that with the increase of the proportion, the white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid has a gradually increasing trend, which has not been reported before and has certain significance for guiding the clinical cerebrospinal fluid examination of children with severe EV-A71 infection.\nThere were some limitations. Only one center was involved, leading to a small sample size. In addition, the numbers of patients with EV-A71 infection in the third and fourth stages were small. The retrospective nature of the study limited the data to those available in the charts. The mechanism of the EV-A71 virus invading the nervous system and the relationship between different mechanisms and the speed and severity of disease progression are not fully understood, and further research is needed."
