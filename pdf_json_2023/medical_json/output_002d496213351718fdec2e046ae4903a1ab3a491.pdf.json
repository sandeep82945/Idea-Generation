            "text": "Page 2/19\nIntroduction liver cancer is a kind of the most common malignant cancer with extremely high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Racial/ethnic and geographical disparities in incidence and mortality are notable in liver cancer(Alvarez et al. 2022). The highest rates of both incidence and mortality of liver cancer were observed mainly in lower HDI (Human Development Index) countries and race including several regions in Northern and Western Africa and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia(Wong et al. 2017). Among them, Mongolia has the highest incidence of liver cancer, and liver cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in Mongolia among both men and women(Sung et al. 2021). The incidence rates of liver cancer was 4 times higher in Mongolia than those rate among men in China and the Republic of Korea according to estimated data from GLOBOCAN 2018 developed by IARC (Freddie et al. 2018). Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is the main primary liver cancer, accounting for 75%-85% of cases, and the other primary liver cancers include some intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (10%-15%), and some rare types(Sia et al. 2017; Sung et al. 2021).\nThe strati ed assessment of the risk of liver cancer in the population is the basis for the development of different liver cancer screening strategies. However, this risk factor varies considerably by region and\nPage 3/19\npopulation(D'Souza et al. 2020). The high-risk groups of HCC mainly include those with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, or those who were heavy drinking, smoking and severe overweight or a atoxin B-contaminated foodstuffs(Forner et al. 2012; Thomas et al. 2018). In Mongolia, people with HBV and HCV and co-infections of HBV carriers with HCV or HDV (hepatitis delta viruses), as well as those with frequently drinking are more likely to develop liver cancer(Baatarkhuu et al. 2011; Chimed et al. 2017; Yoona et al. 2016). Due to the in uence of various factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the cancer cell, cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment exists the extraordinary amount of complexity.\nThe explosion of human sequencing data in recent years has made it possible to combine sequencing data from different ethnic groups to analyze their molecular characteristics. In 2000, Candia et al performed whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing 76 Mongolian HCC patients and the rst time studied the molecular landscape of Mongolian HCC and found Mongolian HCC unique drivers (most notably GTF2IRD2B, PNRC2, and SPTA1)(Candia et al. 2020). However, the robust molecular subclasses with potentially unique tumor molecular level properties and the biological process involved still need to be further explored. Here we compared the Mongolian liver cancer transcriptome GSE144269 dataset(Candia et al. 2020) and Caucasian HCC from GEO with GSE184733(Liu et al. 2022) aiming to identify the biomarkers with potentially unique tumor molecular level characteristics and the biological process involved. We found signi cant differences in the metabolic processes of Mongolian HCC compared with Caucasian HCC in the United States. The biological processes they share include those in which most immune cells, broblasts and endothelial cells are involved.\nMaterials and Methods Data Collection and Preprocessing\nRNA Sequencing count data matrix with rows as transcript identi cations and columns as speci c samples of Mongolian HCC (consists of 70 HCC tumors and matched nontumor tissue) and Caucasian HCC (contains of 17 HCC samples with paired adjacent normal liver tissue) were download from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository with accession number GSE144269 and GSE184733. The source data of Mongolian HCC are obtained from a public GitHub repository at https://github.com/juliancandia/. The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) count data including White and Asian were collected from GDC data portal at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository. The source data came from the corresponding article(The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2017). The raw count data were merged together and then ensemble ID was converted to gene name according to the GTF annotation le (Release 34, GRCh37).\nIdenti cation of differentially expressed genes for 2 Race\nThe raw RNA-seq read counts were processed in the following steps. (1) Genes with very low expression levels in all tissues were ltered out and the ltered data were preprocessed through edgeR(Smyth 2010). (2) The preprocessed gene expression matrix were performed transformation and weighted linear model\nPage 4/19\nanalysis by voom (Law et al. 2014). (3) Then \u201climma\u201d package was used for differentially expressed genes analysis(Ritchie et al. 2015). The differentially expressed genes for 2 races were obtained by transforming expression values, and genes were sorted according to the log2FoldChange (logFC) value. Next, the intersection differentially expressed genes and unique differentially expressed genes in each disease sample dataset were computed separately for the up-regulated and down-regulated genes by Venn diagram and the genes of each part were output to the les through the function of \u201cintersect\u201d and \u201csetdiff\u201d in R language. The criterion for screening DEGs is that the P < 0.05 and | logFC | > 1.\nGene Set Enrichment Analysis\nGO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for both the intersecting DEGs and the unique DEGs for 2 races were carried. Firstly, the org.Hs.eg.db package is used to convert gene names to entrez IDs. Then we used clusterPro ler package (Yu et al. 2012) to compare these gene clusters by their enriched biological processes and pathway, with the strict cutoff of p-values < 0.05.\nSurvival Analysis\nWe selected genes whose logFC was greater than 2 in DEGs of Mongolian HCC. Then the expression matrix of these genes in all tumor samples was extracted. Then the data of survival time and survival status were merged by the name of the samples. Survival analysis was performed by \u201csurvival\u201d packages(Goel et al. 2010). The tumor samples were divided into high expression group and low expression group based on the expression levels of a gene of interest (cutoff: median), and a log-rank test was used to test the difference in the overall survival between the two groups. The association between the Mongolian-speci c differential genes and overall survival was also analyzed in White and Asian populations from TCGA database.\nFunctional Protein Association PPI Network Analysis\n61 genes that involved in metabolic processes were analyzed to identify potential interactions by the online STRING database (Szklarczyk et al. 2017). PPIs with a highest con dence score \u2265 0.4 were reserved and the results imported to Cytoscape (Shannon et al. 2003) for network visualization.\nAll data in this paper were deal with R language, and all statistical methods use the corresponding R package. All R codes can be requested by mail(huangrui0813@126.com).\nResults Identi cation of the differentially expressed genes, intersection genes and the setdiff genes for 2 Races\n70 pairs of RNA Sequencing count data from tumor and their corresponding adjacent normal liver tissue of Mongolian HCC patients were download from GEO. Meanwhile, RNA Sequencing count data from 17 Caucasian HCC tumor samples with paired adjacent non-neoplastic tissue also download from GEO database. The detail showed in Supplementary Table\u00a01. We arranged the two groups of data into a gene\nPage 5/19\nexpression matrix with rows named gene names and columns named sample names in the same way. Then we obtained 1162 up-regulated genes and 2981 down-regulated genes in Mongolian HCC, 1498 upregulated genes and 2974 down-regulated genes in Caucasian HCC through the same set of analysis procedures(voom-limma) with cutoff of p-values < 0.05 and | logFC | > 1, The detail showed in Table\u00a01.\nTable 1 The number of total DEGs of the 2 races, the numbers of Intersection genes and setdiff genes\nRace Numbers of Up-regulated gene\nNumbers of Down-regulated genes\nNumbers of Speci c up-regulated genes\nNumbers of Speci c down-regulated genes\nMongolian 1162 2981 908 1946\nCaucasian 1498 2947 1244 1912\nIntersection genes\n254 1035 - -\nWe got the intersection genes and setdiff genes(means Genes in mongolian that are not in caucasian and genes in caucasian that are not in mongolian) in 2 races using the function of \u201cintersect\u201d and \u201csetdiff\u201d from R. The intersection genes contains 254 Co-upregulated genes and 1035 co-downregulated genes in mongolian and caucasian. Setdiff genes consists of 908 up-regulated genes and 1946 down-regulated genes from mongolian HCC, 1244 up-regulated genes and 1912 down-regulated genes in caucasian HCC. The results showed in VennDiagram in Fig.\u00a01.\nIn order to explore the characteristics of biological processes and signaling pathways involved in these up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes in Mongolian and Caucasian. We divided the genes we got through venn into three groups. The rst group of genes were those whose expression levels changed only in Mongolian HCC and were unchanged in Caucasian patients. The second group of gene were upand down-regulated in Caucasian but not in Mongolian HCC. The third group of genes those that were both up-and down-regulated in Mongolians and Caucasian HCC. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment were performed for each of the genes with logFC > 1 in the three groups. We found that Mongolian setdiff DEGs were mainly involved in biological processes including biosynthesis, catabolic and metabolic processes of various amino acids, lipids, purines and pyrimidines, organic acids and other metabolically reprogramming processes in cells (Fig.\u00a02A). The number of metabolic reprogramming accounts for more than a third of all biological processes in Mongolian. That's about 1/10 in Caucasians. The number of metabolic reprogramming processes shared by the two races is only about 1/20 of the total number of biological processes(Table\u00a02). Especially, we found altered the synthesis and metabolic pathways of some amino acids are unique in Mongolian HCC, such as alpha-amino acid, aromatic amino acid family, arginine, aspartate family amino acid, cysteine, branched-chain amino acid, cellular amino acid, cellular modi ed amino acid, erythrose 4-phosphate/phosphoenolpyruvate family amino acid, glutamine family amino acid, histidine, homocysteine, kynurenine, lysine, proline, methionine, serine family amino acid, sulfur amino acid, tryptophan and tyrosine so on. A variety of substances are involved in both synthesis and metabolism process. In addition, we also found that some Mongolian setdiff DEGs were involved in\nPage 6/19\nimmune processes such as complement activation and humoral immune response. The corresponding KEGG signaling pathway mainly includes complement and coagulation cascades, bile secretion, cytochrome P450 related metabolism, the metabolism or synthesis of various amino acids. PPAR signaling pathway, fatty acid degradation and so on (Fig.\u00a02B). However, The DEGs shared by the 2 races are mainly involved in biological processes were immune processes and cell division activities, phosphorylation, nucleotide metabolic reprogramming and so on (Fig.\u00a02C and Table2). The KEGG signal pathway mainly includes Viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor, Cell cycle, ECMreceptor interaction, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Mineral absorption, Amoebiasis, Cell adhesion molecules, B cell and T cell receptor signaling pathway and so on (Fig.\u00a02D). We found that alterations in glycosylation modi cations are speci c in Caucasian HCC setdiff DEGs GO analysis.\nTable 2 Numbers of GO terms\n\u00a0 Numbers of Mongolian setdiff GO terms\nNumbers of Caucasian setdiff GO terms\nNumbers of Intersection genes GO terms\nTotal 1018 926 1164\nmetabolic process\n330 92 62\nTransport of material\n82 71 28\nimmune response\n52 187 311\nCell cycle 15 0 128\nglycosylation 0 6 0\nOverall survival of Mongolian setdiff genes\nThe clinical information of patients with Mongolia HCC was extracted and included follow-up time and clinical status. After removing patients\u2019 data with incomplete clinical information, according to the expression data of genes in each patient's tumor tissue, patients were divided into high expression group and low expression group with the median value of expression level as the dividing line. Correlation between overall survival and survival time in two group were analyzed using the \u201csurvival\u201d packages of R. We selected Mongolian setdiff genes with |logFC| > 2 for further survival analysis. We further analyzed 61 genes involved in metabolic processes, and more than half of these 61 genes encode proteases for multiple metabolic processes. We also analyzed whether expression of these 61 genes affected survival in whites and Asians based on TCGA clinical data (Table 3). We found 41 genes expression level was signi cantly correlated with survival in Asian HCC. Only 4 genes (SPP1, IGF1, TBXA2R and XRCC2) expression levels were associated with overall survival in White HCC. Among them, the expression of 20 genes (UPP2, PCK1, HOXA10, GLYAT, SPP1, ASPDH, XRCC2, SULT2A1, GNMT, ADH1B, HPD, CYP2D6, APOF, HPX, FTCD, MAT1A, MMP12, CYP4F3, MOGAT2 and OTX1) was dramatically correlated with survival in\nPage 7/19\nMongolian HCC (p value < 0.01), the expression level of PCK1, GLYAT, SPP1, ASPDH, XRCC2, GNMT, ADH1B, HPD, FTCD, MMP12, MOGAT2 and OTX1 was also observably associated with survival in Asian HCC (p value < 0.05), the expression level of SPP1 and XRCC2 was also associated with survival in White HCC (p value < 0.05). Potential interactions by the online STRING databases showed that these molecules are interacting with each other(Fig.\u00a03). Figure\u00a04 showed the Kaplan-Meier survival curve of 6 genes whose expression levels changed by more than 10 times. The details of the other genes showed in Table 3. We also found some transcripts, mainly non-coding RNAs, were not found to have expression levels in both white and Asian races according to the RNA sequencing data of TCGA database (supp Table 2).\nPage 8/19\nTable 3 Survival analysis of Mongolian metabolism-related genes in Mongolian HCC, Asian HCC and white HCC\nGenes FC Mongolian\nOS_pValue Asian OS_pValue\nWhite

in Mongolia is currently one of the highest in the world(Alcorn 2011; Ariana et al. 2018). Previous research found Mongolian HCC unique drivers(Candia et al. 2020). However, we believe that the investigation into the causes of the high incidence and mortality of liver cancer in Mongolian people should not ignore the environmental factors that affect the changes in gene expression level, and thus the epigenetic level changes and metabolic level reprogramming. Here we analyzed and compared Mongolian hepatocellular carcinoma transcriptome data with Caucasian hepatocellular carcinoma data from the United States. We found that 908 up-regulated genes and 1946 down-regulated genes from Mongolian HCC, 1244 up-regulated genes and 1912 down-regulated genes in Caucasian HCC. According to the results, there were more up-regulated genes in Caucasian hepatocellular carcinoma under the same screening criteria (P < 0.05 and | logFC | > 1). And then from these DEGs, we obtained the individual DEGs and the intersection DEGs in 2 races.\nThen we performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for these DEGs from Mongolian, Caucasian and the intersection respectively. The results indicate that the main biological process involved in DEGs in Mongolian hepatocellular carcinoma is metabolic reprogramming compared with Caucasian hepatocellular carcinoma DEGs and intersection DEGs in 2 races. In particular, the biosynthesis and metabolism of various amino acids were unique in DEGs pathways enrichment analysis of Mongolian HCC, but not found in Caucasian HCC. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of malignancy rst recognized. In 2000, Hanahan and Weinberg published papers \u201cThe Hallmarks of Cancer\u201d which de ned six characteristics of tumors, including sustained proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, Inducing angiogenesis and activating invasion/metastasis(Douglas et al. 2000). In 2011, they published a paper \u201cThe Hallmarks of Cancer: the next generation\u201d which added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality: reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction(Weinberg 2011). They de ned the distinguishing molecular level characteristics of a cancer for the rst time.\nWe found altered amino acid such as serine, glycine, tryptophan and methionine metabolism in Mongolian HCC tumor tissue compared to adjacent, nonmalignant tissues. The signi cant role of onecarbon metabolism such as serine, glycine in cancer progression has been extensively studied over the past few years. One-carbon metabolism integrates carbon units from amino acids to achieve REDOX maintenance and satisfy intracellular biosynthesis. One-carbon metabolism is directly involved in epigenetic modi cation through the methylation of proteins and nucleic acids. Recent genetic and functional evidence also suggests that hyperactivation of one-carbon metabolism is a possible driver of oncogenesis(Amelio et al. 2014; Locasale 2013). The speci city of amino acid metabolism of Mongolian HCC also includes the metabolic process of branched chain amino acids besides one-carbon metabolism. The important role of branched-chain amino acid metabolism in tumor development has also been widely studied (Sun et al. 2018; Wei et al. 2021). Moreover, we also observed that the biological processes of urea cycle, triglyceride synthesis and triglyceride degradation only in Mongolian HCC. Glycosylation process unique to Caucasian HCC. Phosphorylation process is present in both. Moreover,\nPage 12/19\nthe overlapped genes in 2 races mainly take part in immunity process and the cell division process. Our previous study found that these genes involved in the cell division process and immunity process generally have changes in copy number in HCC tumor tissues regardless of race and region(Huang et al. 2021).\nTumors adapt to speci c stresses through metabolic reprogramming to develop metabolic phenotypes that differ from adjacent, nonmalignant tissues(Faubert et al. 2020). The metabolic reprogramming processes that researchers have discovered over the past few decades include elevated\u201caerobic glycolysis\u201d in support of ATP production, persistent up-regulation of amino acid, sugar and lipid metabolisms, de novo synthesis of nucleotides, simultaneous synthesis and degradation of triglycerides and phospholipid among others(Ward and Thompson 2012). Due to the in uence of various factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the cancer cell, there exists the extraordinary amount of metabolic heterogeneity among different tumors, even within distinct regions of the same tumor(Faubert et al. 2020). Therefore, in addition to tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment also shows extraordinary complexity. The tumor microenvironment was composed of a social microenvironment and physical microenvironment. The social microenvironment included immune cells, broblast cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix and microbiota. During tumorigenesis and development, all organisms living in the social microenvironment will encounter speci c stresses such as poor nutrient availability, oxygen-de cient environment, low pH and redox stress, which together constitute the physical microenvironment(Whiteside 2008). We found signi cant differences in the metabolic processes of Mongolian HCC compared with Caucasian HCC in the United States. The biological processes they share include those in which most immune cells, broblasts and endothelial cells are involved. From our results, we can conclude that the biological processes shared by Mongolians HCC and Caucasians HCC mostly include social microenvironments, while the biological processes speci c to Mongolians are mainly physical microenvironments. The complexity of the physical microenvironment may have a greater correlation with the occurrence and development of tumors. This may, to some extent, explain the high incidence and mortality of liver cancer in Mongolians at the molecular level.\nMoreover, we found UPP2, Liver-Speci c Uridine Phosphorylase, whose expression level down-regulated more than 10 times in Mongolian HCC and was dramatically correlated with survival in Mongolian HCC (p value < 0.01). Previous research has found that UPP catalyzes the reversible phosphorylytic cleavage of uridine and deoxyuridine to uracil and ribose- or deoxyribose-1-phosphate(Johansson 2003) and plays an important pharmacological role in activating uoropyrimidine nucleoside chemotherapeutic agents such as 5- uorouracil and capecitabine(Roosild et al. 2011). This may provide guidance for the accurate treatment of Mongolian HCC patients.\nDeclarations All papers must contain the following statements after the main body of the text and before the reference list:\nPage 13/19\nAcknowledgement\u00a0(optional)\nWe sincerely thank and pay tribute to all patient volunteers who provided data in our study.
