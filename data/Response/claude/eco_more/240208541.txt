 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Extend the analysis to non-convex cost functions. The paper focuses on convex cost functions, but many real-world scenarios may involve non-convex costs. Studying the convergence properties of BR dynamics with non-convex costs could lead to new insights.

2. Consider alternative learning dynamics beyond BR. The paper analyzes BR dynamics, but other learning models like fictitious play or regret minimization could also be relevant. Analyzing if and how quickly these dynamics converge would be interesting. 

3. Incorporate stochastic shocks or perturbations. The paper studies deterministic dynamics, but introducing randomness could make the models more realistic. Analyzing the impact of stochasticity on the convergence is an open question.

4. Empirically test the dynamics in real contests. The paper proves theoretical convergence results, but testing how well the models predict real human behavior in contests could be enlightening. Conducting lab experiments on contest games could validate or refine the models.

5. Apply the dynamics to new domains like blockchain mining. The paper mentions blockchain mining contests as a motivating application. Formalizing mining as a contest game and empirically testing the dynamics on blockchain data could demonstrate practical relevance.
