The major risk factors for developing glaucoma are age, genetics, and sensitivity to intraocular pressure (IOP). Current treatments for glaucoma aim to decrease IOP. However, poor patient compliance with IOP-lowering drops combined with lack of responsiveness to IOP-lowering drugs and surgeries leads to permanent vision loss in many patients. Thus, further research aimed at protecting RGCs, independent of IOP, is an approach that needs to be explored [1\u20134].\nWhile the underlying molecular cause of RGC degeneration and death in glaucoma is complex, it is clear that accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a"

The disease results in irreversible blindness and affects almost\n*Correspondence: Tonia S.

We previously showed that the antioxidant NRF2/ARE pathway is activated after elevation of IOP. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2), when activated, binds to the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE), an enhancer element that is upstream of many antioxidant genes. Nrf2 affects the degree and onset of neurodegeneration in many models, including models of RGC injury and glaucoma [9\u201315]. Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 remains in the cytoplasm, where it is sequestered by its repressor protein, Kelchlike ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) and is constantly targeted for degradation via ubiquitination. When Keap1 is oxidized, it undergoes a conformational change that releases Nrf2, allowing it to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus of the cell where it can bind to the ARE, and activate antioxidant gene transcription. Nrf2 can also be released from Keap1 upon phosphorylation from upstream signaling molecules, resulting also in nuclear translocation [9, 16\u201318]. We also found that Nrf2 is phosphorylated by the PI3K/Akt pathway at 2 weeks post-IOP elevation in the microbead occlusion model of glaucoma [8]. Further, inhibiting this pathway prevented increases in ARE-driven transcripts, showing that the retina endogenously responds to increased IOP via activation of the NRF2-ARE pathway through phosphorylation by PI3K/Akt. We have also shown that NRF2-ARE activation in glaucoma is context dependent\u2014in the presence of erythropoietin, we found that the NRF2-ARE pathway is activated through phosphorylation by MAPK instead [19].\nIn this study we sought to determine the cell-type specificity of the NRF2/ARE pathway activation in the mouse microbead occlusion model of glaucoma. We used Nrf2fl/fl mice and RGC or glial-directed AAVs to deliver Cre to each cell type separately. We then quantified functional and molecular changes in both groups after IOP elevation. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of AAV2/2. Nrf2 gene therapy in the context of a global Nrf2 knockout or overexpression in wild-type mice following microbead occlusion."

The AAV.ARE.tdTomato reporter virus was constructed as previously described [19]. The construct was tested in ARPE-19 cells prior to use in vivo (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 1). ARPE-19 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown as previously described [20]. Cells in complete media were transfected with plasmid DNA mixed with FuGENE HD\n(Promega, Madison, WI; #E2311) at a ratio of 1:4 (1\u00a0mg DNA: 4 ml FuGENE). Eight-well chamber slides and 6-well plates were transfected with 200ng and 1\u00a0mg DNA per well, respectively. One day after transfection, the media was replaced with serum-free (SF) medium and incubated for 24\u00a0 h. Cells were treated with SF medium containing either 5 mM sulforaphane, an NRF2 activator, (MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ; #HY13,755) or vehicle (0.025% DMSO) and incubated for an additional 24\u00a0 h. Cells were preserved with Histochoice, washed with PBS, and coverslips mounted with ProLong Gold (Thermo Fisher). For immunoblots, 10\u00a0\u00b5g of PBS-soluble protein was analyzed per lane. Blots were probed with rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Limerick, PA; #600-401-379) and mouse antiHA (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA; #2367). ARE activation, based on increased tdTomato (tdTom) fluorescence, was detected in transfected cells treated with sulforaphane, but not in those that did not receive sulforaphane nor those that were transfected with the plasmid carrying the inactive M4 ARE (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01). Cells transfected with WT ARE and treated with either DMSO or sulforaphane produced both tdTom and ZsGreen, with more intense tdTom in the cells treated with sulforaphane (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0 1). However, in the ARPE19 cells transfected with M4 ARE, there was no tdTom band (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01).\nAAVs were generated that express Cre recombinase and tdTom (see Table\u00a0 1). The promoters included either the 1\u00a0 kb human vimentin (Vim) promoter that was derived from Addgene plasmid #29,114 [21] or the 0.66\u00a0kb mouse gamma-synuclein (Sncg) promoter (Addgene plasmid #153,163) [22]. RGCs were targeted with the combination of Sncg promoter and AAV2/2 capsid, which has been widely used to efficiently infect RGCs after intravitreal injection. Additionally, the Sncg promoter has been characterized such that following intravitreal injection, more than 85% of the transduced RGCs also double-labeled with RBPMS [22]. While we aimed to primarily transduce astrocytes with the combination of a 1\u00a0kb Vim promoter and a modified AAV6 capsid (ShH10 with an additional Y455F mutation) [31], we have not excluded the possibility that some M\u00fcller glia were also transduced following intravitreal injection. Control AAVs contained tdTomato without Cre (see Table\u00a0 1). All Cre and control AAVs were packaged in-house using triple transfection of HEK cells."

Leica EM-UC7 microtome was used to collect 1\u00a0\u03bcm thick sections of the optic nerves. Sections were then stained with 1% paraphenylenediamine and 1% toluidine blue and were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope using 100x oil immersion objective (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). The optic nerves were montaged into a 5 \u00d7 5 image using the Nikon Elements software to scan a large image. We used the Counting Array and Better Cell Counter plugins to ImageJ, which creates\na grid of nine squares overtop the montaged optic nerve. We manually counted healthy and degenerating axons, which are color-coded by the plugins. Degenerative axon profiles were identified by dark paraphenylenediamine staining due to collapsed myelin or loose myelin (onioning) surrounding the axon. A grid was used to avoid bias, by always counting in the same squares, using a cross configuration. 20% of the optic nerve cross-sectional area was counted and the total was multiplied by five to estimate total and degenerating axons within the nerve. Each experimental group included 4\u20135 nerves."

            "text": "Knockdown of Nrf2 in either RGCs or glia decreases the endogenous antioxidant response In order to explore which cell type, RGCs or glial cells, were responsible for the endogenous antioxidant response after IOP elevation, we knocked down Nrf2 in each cell type separately by injecting appropriate AAVs into Nrf2fl/fl mice. The RGC-directed and glial-directed pAAV constructs are shown in Fig.\u00a0 1A, B. Intravitreal injection of AAV2/2.Sncg.Cre into Nrf2fl/fl mice resulted in RGC-specific expression based on co-localization with NeuN in the ganglion cell layer (GCL; Fig.\u00a0 1C). Intravitreal injection of AAV2/6m.Vim.Cre in Nrf2fl/fl mice resulted in glial cell specific expression based on doublelabeling with GFAP (Fig.\u00a01D). Because GFAP is expressed by astrocytes and M\u00fcller glia in the retina [35\u201338], colocalization of GFAP and tdTom in retina cross-sections in the GCL accounts for both cell types. However, in retinal flatmounts the morphology demonstrates that we primarily transduced astrocytes (Fig.\u00a01E).\nWe then quantified levels of representative ARE-driven transcripts that we detected previously as being elevated during the retina\u2019s endogenous antioxidant response to\n(See figure on previous page.)

All mice were injected with microbeads to elevate IOP two weeks after injection with the respective AAVs and tissue was collected after two weeks of elevated pressure. Results were compared to Nrf2fl/fl mice injected with the same serotype AAV and promoters, delivering tdTom without Cre and referenced as fold change over tdTom (Fig.\u00a0 1F). The previously reported IOP-induced increase in Prdx6 [14] was blunted by knock-down of Cre in the RGCs, but was unaffected by knock-down of Cre in the glia. The difference in Prdx6 expression between mice treated with AAV2/2.mSncg.tdTomato and those treated with AAV2/2.mSncg.Cre was statistically significant (p = 0.0294; n = 4 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a0 1F). Knockdown of Nrf2 in either the RGCs or glia prevented the IOP-induced increase in expression of Gpx1 and Sod3, but neither affected the increase in Ho-1 (p = 0.6651, p = 0.533, and p = 0.1775 respectively; n = 3\u20134 retinas/ group respectively; Fig.\u00a01F).\nTo confirm that NRF2 activation was decreased in the AAV.Cre groups, we quantified the ratio of phosphorylated to total NRF2 (Fig.\u00a0 1G, H). There was less phosphorylated NRF2 in both the AAV2/2.Sncg.Cre and the AAV2/6m.Vim.Cre injected mice than in their respective controls (p = 0.0227 and p = 0.008, respectively; n = 4 retinas/group).\nWe also quantified the endogenous antioxidant response at the protein level (Fig.\u00a01G-K). Consistent with the PCR data, knock-down of Nrf2 in the RGCs prevented the IOP-induced increase in PRDX6, but knockdown in the glia had no effect (p = 0.0395; n = 3 retinas/ group; Fig.\u00a01I). There was no statistically significant difference in GPX1 levels in either group (p = 0.1852; n = 4 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a0 1J). Lastly, there was less SOD3 in both the RGC-specific and the glial-specific knockdown groups in comparison to their respective controls (p = 0.0117 and p = 0.0231, respectively; n = 3 retinas/ group; Fig.\u00a01K).\nKnockdown of Nrf2 in either RGCs or glia causes earlier onset vision loss and axon degeneration We previously detected PhNR deficits at 2-wks post-IOP elevation in the microbead occlusion model [8]. There was no difference between saline groups with or without delivery of Cre, therefore, all saline groups were combined for calculating percent of saline. Nrf2 knockdown in either the RGCs (n = 20) or the glial cells (n = 13) further decreased the PhNR amplitude at 2- weeks post-IOP elevation compared to saline controls (n = 46) (p = 0.036 and p = 0.0013, respectively; Fig.\u00a0 2A, B). The PhNR amplitudes also were decreased compared to the noCre, microbead injected controls; p = 0.0195 (n = 11) and p = 0.0041 (n = 7) for the RGC or glia-directed vectors, respectively. At 5-wks post-IOP elevation, there was no\ndifference in PhNR amplitude between the AAV2/6.Vim. Cre and respective no-Cre groups (p = 0.5182, data not shown). In contrast, RGC-specific knockdown of Nrf2 caused a further reduction in PhNR amplitude compared to no-Cre controls (data not shown).\nKnock-down of Nrf2 in either cell-type had no effect on the VEP at 2-wks post-IOP elevation as expected (data not shown). At 5-wks post-IOP elevation the VEP amplitude was similarly reduced in all MOM mice compared to saline controls (n = 24) regardless of Cre delivery (p < 0.05; n = 14 and 8 eyes/group for RGC and glial-directed nonCre controls and n = 10 and 5 for the RGC and glialdirected Cre groups, respectively; Fig.\u00a02A, C).\nMore degenerative axon profiles were evident in optic nerve cross-sections from the AAV.Cre injected mice compared to controls at both 2- and 5-wks post-IOP elevation (Fig.\u00a0 2D). There was no statistically significant difference in axon counts between the no-Cre and Cre saline injected mice so all saline groups were combined. Fewer total axons (p < 0.0001) and more degenerative axons (p < 0.0001 at both time points) were present in optic nerves from AAV2/2.Sncg.Cre injected mice compared to saline controls (n = 5 and 12 nerves/group, respectively; Fig.\u00a0 2E-H). Similarly, AAV2/6.Vim.Cre injected mice had fewer total axons (p < 0.0001; n = 4) and more degenerative axons (p < 0.0001 at both time points) than saline control mice at both time-points (Fig.\u00a0 2DH). There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of axons between the AAV2/2.Sncg. Cre and AAV2/6.Vim.Cre groups (n = 5 and 4 nerves/ group, respectively; Fig.\u00a02E, G). However, there were significantly more degenerative axons in the AAV2/2.Sncg. Cre mice compared to AAV2/6.Vim.Cre mice at 2-weeks (p = 0.0005). This effect was not present at 5-weeks.\nActivation of the ARE in RGCs at 2 weeks post-IOP elevation As an independent approach to determine if elevated IOP can activate the ARE in the RGCs, we intravitreally injected an AAV2/2 delivering ARE driving tdTom into wildtype mice two weeks prior to inducing elevated IOP. The resulting tdTom fluorescence was imaged in vivo at 1- and 2-weeks post-IOP elevation (Fig.\u00a0 3A). Retinal fluorescence was evident in both MOM groups, but not in the saline controls (Fig.\u00a0 3A). This corresponded to an approximately 2-fold increase at 1-wk and 3-fold increase at 2-wks (p = 0.0015 and p = 0.0025, respectively; n = 4-6eyes/group; Fig.\u00a03B). The greater increase at 2-wks compared to 1-wk was statistically significant (p = 0.029; n = 6 eyes/group). The greater ARE activation at 2-wks matched our previously findings of peak activation of the endogenous antioxidant response at 2-wks post-IOP elevation [14].\nExpression of Nrf2 in ganglion cell layer (GCL) neurons in Nrf2 KO mice We previously demonstrated that Nrf2 KO mice with elevated IOP lack an endogenous retinal antioxidant response and exhibit earlier onset of axon degeneration and vision loss [8]. To determine if expression of Nrf2 only in the GCL neurons would be sufficient to activate the antioxidant response, we intravitreally injected AAV2/2.Nrf2 or AAV2/2.eGFP into Nrf2 KO mice and assessed all outcomes at 2 weeks post-IOP elevation. Total retinal NRF2 levels were increased in AAV2/2. Nrf2 injected eyes but not in controls (Fig.\u00a0 4A). Treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 decreased DHE fluorescence regardless of IOP elevation (Fig.\u00a0 4B, C). In both the saline-injected control mice and microbead-injected mice, treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 increased PRDX6 levels (p = 0.0276 and p = 0.0121, respectively; n = 3 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a0 4D, E). Similarly, GPX1 levels were also increased (p = 0.0141 compared to saline-injected controls and p = 0.1376 compared to microbead-injected mice; n = 3 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a0 4D, E). There was no difference in SOD3 levels between groups (data not shown).\nWe then assessed if transduction of the RGCs with AAV2/2.Nrf2 was sufficient to prevent vision loss. We previously published that the PhNR and VEP amplitudes were reduced in wildtype, but not Nrf2 KO microbeadinjected mice compared to their relevant controls [8]. Here we detected no change in PhNR amplitude between saline and microbead injected Nrf2 KO mice treated with AAV2/2.eGFP, similar to our previous findings [8]. The PhNR amplitude in Nrf2 KO mice injected with saline and treated with AAV2/2.Nrf2 was increased compared to saline-injected AAV2/2.eGFP controls (p = 0.0357; n = 6\u20138 eyes/group). Thus, we calculated the percent of saline for each microbead injected group to their own saline controls. Elevated IOP did not affect the PhNR\namplitude in the Nrf2 KO mice treated with AAV2/2. Nrf2 (n = 6\u20138 eyes/group; Fig.\u00a0 4F, G). Similarly, treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 increased the VEP N1 amplitude in Nrf2 KO mice whether they were injected with saline or microbeads (p = 0.0015 and p = 0.0146, respectively; n = 6\u20138 eyes/group respectively; Fig.\u00a0 4F, H). Therefore, the percent of saline was calculated based on the saline control for the corresponding microbead injected group. There was no difference in VEP N1 amplitude between saline and microbead injected Nrf2 KO mice treated with AAV2/2.Nrf2 (Fig.\u00a04F, H).\nIn agreement with our previous study in microbead occluded Nrf2 KO mice, we detect fewer total axons and more axon degeneration in Nrf2 KO mice treated with AAV2/2.eGFP after microbead occlusion as compared to saline-injected controls at 2-weeks post-IOP elevation (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0031; n = 3\u20134 nerves/group; Fig.\u00a04I-K) [8]. Treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 had no effect on the total number of axons in the saline injected mice, therefore, all saline controls were combined. Microbead-injected, Nrf2 KO mice treated with AAV2/2.Nrf2 had more total axons compared to those treated with AAV2/2.eGFP (p = 0.0113; n = 3\u20134 nerves/group; Fig.\u00a0 4I, J). Treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 decreased the number of degenerative axons in the saline controls (p = 0.00085), therefore, each microbead group was normalized to its own saline control group. Microbead-injected, Nrf2 KO mice treated with AAV2/2.Nrf2 had fewer degenerative axons compared to those treated with AAV2/2.eGFP, but upon normalization to their own saline groups this effect was lost (Fig.\u00a04I, K). Notably, the Nrf2 knockout AAV2/2. Nrf2 treated, saline injected group had an average of 132 \u00b1 33 (sd) degenerative axons (n = 3) and the corresponding microbead injected group had an average of 180 \u00b1 26 (sd) degenerative axons (n = 3), using the student\u2019s t-test\nthis yields a p value of 0.03, suggesting a protective effect of Nrf2 that is not obvious in the normalized data.\nOverexpression of Nrf2 in the GCL neurons of wild-type mice increases the endogenous antioxidant response after IOP elevation We sought to determine if overexpression of Nrf2 in GCL neurons of wildtype mice would enhance the retina\u2019s endogenous response to elevated IOP. Treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 increased total retina levels of NRF2 in both saline and microbead-injected mice (p = 0.0028 and p = 0.0184; n = 4 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a05A, B). We confirmed localization of the increased NRF2 in the GCL neurons by co-labeling with NeuN (Fig.\u00a0 5C). DHE fluorescence was increased in the microbead-injected AAV2/2.eGFP mice in comparison to their saline-injected controls\n(p = 0.0012; n = 6\u20138 eyes/group; Fig.\u00a0 5D, E). Treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 prevented the IOP-induced increase in DHE fluorescence (p = 0.2767; n = 6\u20138 eyes/group; Fig.\u00a05D, E).\nLevels of antioxidants at the mRNA and protein level in IOP-elevated mice were further increased by treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2. Prdx6, Nrf2, Gpx1 and Txn1 were increased after elevation of IOP and treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 in comparison to the AAV2/2.eGFP controls (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0035, p = 0.0467, and p = 0.0237, respectively; n = 5 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a05F). This was above and beyond the endogenous increase in these antioxidant proteins we previously reported [8]. In AAV2/2.eGFP mice, PRDX6, GPX1 and SOD3 were increased in microbead-injected mice at 2 wks post-IOP elevation in comparison to saline-injected controls (p = 0.0179, p = 0.0377, and p = 0.014 respectively; n = 3\u20134 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a05G, H). This was consistent with our previous studies, which indicated that the retina endogenously responds to increased ROS by upregulating expression of these proteins [8]. Mice that received AAV2/2.Nrf2 had an even greater increase in these antioxidant proteins in both saline and microbead groups than AAV2/2.eGFP controls (Fig.\u00a0 5G, H). PRDX6 levels were increased in AAV2/2. Nrf2 treated saline or microbead-injected controls in comparison to AAV2/2.eGFP injected mice (p = 0.043 and p = 0.0153, respectively; n = 3\u20134 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a0 5G, H). GPX1 was also increased in AAV2/2.Nrf2 treated saline or microbead-injected controls in comparison to their AAV2/2.eGFP treated counterparts (p = 0.0124 and p = 0.0096, respectively; n = 3\u20134 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a0 5G, H). Similarly, SOD3 levels were increased in AAV2/2. Nrf2 treated saline-injected controls in comparison to their AAV2/2.eGFP treated counterparts (p = 0.0032 and p = 0.0013, respectively; n = 3\u20134 retinas/group; Fig.\u00a0 5G, H).\nDHE fluorescence was still elevated in AAV2/2.eGFP mice injected mice in comparison to saline-injected controls at 5-weeks post-IOP elevation (p = 0.0112; n = 4\u20135 eyes/group; Fig.\u00a0 5I). In contrast, there was no increase in DHE fluorescence in the AAV2/2.Nrf2 injected mice (p = 0.7042; n = 4\u20136 eyes/group; Fig.\u00a0 5I). There was no additional increase in PRDX6 levels upon treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 at this time point (n = 5 retinas/all groups; Fig.\u00a05J,K).\nOverexpression of Nrf2 in GCL neurons protects against vision loss and axon degeneration at 2 and 5 weeks postIOP elevation As expected, at 2-wks post-IOP elevation, the PhNR amplitude was decreased in AAV2/2.eGFP mice in comparison to saline controls (p = 0.0008; n = 6 mice/group; Fig.\u00a0 6A), matching our previous results [8]. There was no statistically significant difference in PhNR amplitude\nbetween the saline groups so they were combined for analyses. Treatment with AAV2/2.Nrf2 prevented this decrease (n = 6 mice/group; Fig.\u00a0 6A). When normalized to saline-injected controls, microbead-injected, AAV2/2.Nrf2 treated mice showed significantly greater PhNR amplitude in comparison to microbead-injected, AAV2/2.eGFP treated mice (p = 0.0026; Fig.\u00a0 6A). There was no significant difference in the PhNR latencies of any of the experimental groups (data not shown). As expected, that there were no differences in VEP N1 amplitudes in saline groups or at 2 wks post-IOP elevation (n = 5 mice/group; Fig.\u00a06B). There were also no differences in total or degenerative axons between groups, all optic nerves appeared normal (Fig.\u00a06C-E).\nAt 5-wks post-IOP elevation, both microbead-injected groups had a reduced PhNR amplitude as compared to their relevant saline controls (p = 0.0004 (n = 10\u201312) and p = 0.0173 (n = 7\u20138) for AAV.eGFP and AAV.Nrf2 groups, respectively; Fig.\u00a0 6F). Further, there was no difference between the AAV2/2.Nrf2 and AAV2/2.eGFP treated microbead-injected mice after normalization to saline controls (Fig.\u00a06F). This suggests that the protective effect of AAV2/2.Nrf2 on the PhNR was lost over time. As expected, the VEP N1 amplitude was decreased in the microbead-injected AAV.eGFP mice (n = 9) in comparison to saline-injected controls (n = 17; p = 0.005; Fig.\u00a06G). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between saline controls and the microbead-injected mice treated with AAV2/2.Nrf2 (n = 8; Fig.\u00a0 6G). Degenerative axons were present in glaucomatous optic nerves at 5-wks post-IOP elevation (Fig.\u00a0 6H). There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of axons between the saline groups or the combined saline treated mice (n = 10) and any of the microbead injected groups (n = 5/group; Fig.\u00a0 6I). There was also no statistically significant difference in the number of degenerative axons between microbead-injected, AAV2/2.Nrf2 treated mice (n = 4) and all saline groups combined (n = 8/group; Fig.\u00a0 6J). The number of degenerative axons at 5 weeks in the AAV2/2.eGFP microbead injected group (n = 3) was greater than the saline controls, p = 0.0024, and the AAV2/2.Nrf2 treated, microbead injected mice (n = 4), p = 0.0009 (Fig.\u00a06J)."

            "text": "We previously discovered that an Nrf2-mediated endogenous antioxidant response of the retina delays the onset of glaucomatous neurodegeneration [8]. In this study, we sought to elucidate the roles of the RGCs and the glial cells in this response and to assess the efficacy of AAV2/2.Nrf2 as a neuroprotective treatment. Transduction with AAV2/2.CMV.Nrf2 in the Nrf2 KO background decreased superoxide levels, activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway, and decreased optic nerve pathology. Notably,\nsince the CMV promoter was used for these overexpression experiments it feasible that some displaced amacrine cells and glia were transduced in addition to RGCs [33\u201335].\nTo determine if elevated IOP caused activation of the ARE in the RGCs, we transduced the cells with an ARE reporter construct. Activation of the ARE was detected, supporting the hypothesis that the RGCs contribute to the endogenous antioxidant response of the retina to elevated IOP. The increased tdTom fluorescence occurred concurrently with the previously characterized activation of Nrf2 at 2 weeks post-IOP elevation [8].\nAs another approach, we used different AAV serotype and promoter combinations to specifically deliver Cre to either RGCs or astrocytes in the Nrf2fl/fl mouse. The use of AAV2/2 and the gamma synuclein promoter provided specific expression in the RGCs as previously reported [22]. The use of the AAV6 capsid with tyrosine mutations and a 1\u00a0 kb vimentin promoter resulted in expression in glial cells. More degenerative axons were detected in the mice with RGC-specific knockdown of Nrf2 than in the mice where Nrf2 knockdown was targeted to the glia. This could be due to a greater role of the RGCs or a difference in level of knockdown within the cells in the two groups. Regardless, either RGC-specific or glial-specific knockdown of Nrf2 resulted in a decreased endogenous antioxidant response, increased glaucomatous pathology and increased vision loss, as well as an earlier onset of this pathology. The ARE reporter results show that the RGCs contribute to the endogenous antioxidant response and that increased Nrf2 in these cells can enhance this response and provide neuroprotection. The data suggests that both neurons and glia contribute to the retina\u2019s endogenous antioxidant response but the amplification of this pathway in RGCs is sufficient to compensate for lack of Nrf2 elsewhere. It is possible that activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway is important in both glial cells and RGCs for the IOP-dependent antioxidant response, or these two cell types communicate so substantially that this in vivo approach was insufficient to isolate effects from the RGCs or the glial cells independently. Future in vitro experiments may be needed to separate the two potential explanations.\nWe found that Nrf2 overexpression in GCL neurons, beginning prior to IOP elevation, counteracts the increase in ROS and protects RGCs at both 2 and 5 weeks post-IOP elevation. Our findings agree with previous publications showing an essential role for Nrf2 in neurons\u2019 antioxidant response [13\u201315]. In the future, it would be interesting to determine the therapeutic window for Nrf2 gene therapy. Additionally, the efficacy of Nrf2 activators should be tested. Pharmacological activation of Nrf2 has been shown to be neuroprotective in a model of ischemia/reperfusion retinal injury [13]. Four\nNrf2 activators are currently being explored in clinical trials, which could be used in glaucoma studies in the future [27]. Overexpression or chronic activation of Nrf2 could also have negative side effects. In Drosophila, prolonged activation of Nrf2 can shorten lifespan [28]. Additionally, many activators of Nrf2 work by modifying Keap1 so that it cannot degrade Nrf2 via disruption of its cysteine residues\u2014these activators are often nonspecific and can have off-target effects [27, 29]. Therefore, future studies investigating the downstream responses of activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway might yield more specific therapeutic targets. For example, our work suggests that PRDX6 and SOD3 might contribute significantly to the endogenous antioxidant response, and therefore, exogenously increasing levels of these proteins might be beneficial in delaying or decreasing glaucoma pathogenesis. Previous studies have shown that antioxidants are effective in preserving RGCs and visual function in models of glaucoma [6\u20138, 30]. This study further supports this approach and provides insights into the best antioxidants to pursue for clinical translation.\nOverall, our study elucidates the importance for NRF2 in both RGCs and astrocytes for the retina\u2019s endogenous antioxidant response to glaucoma-induced ROS. Additionally, we show that overexpression of Nrf2 in GCL neurons of wildtype mice is a viable therapeutic approach for axon degeneration, RGC function and other glaucomatous pathology. In contrast, overexpression of Nrf2 in RGCs in an Nrf2 knock-out background is not sufficient to mitigate inevitable glaucomatous pathology.\nAbbreviations IOP intraocular pressure ROS reactive oxygen species NRF2 Nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 ARE antioxidant response element RGC retinal ganglion cell AAV adeno-associated virus PhNR photopic negative response KEAP1 Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s40478-023-01663-1.\nSupplemental Figure 1.
