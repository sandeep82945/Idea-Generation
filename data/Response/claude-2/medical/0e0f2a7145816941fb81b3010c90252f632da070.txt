 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further characterize the binding of MASP49 to other mammalian cell types beyond Vero cells, macrophages, and cardiomyocytes. Identify additional receptors it may bind to facilitate cell entry.

2. Investigate if MASP49 binds to and enters cells as a complex with other parasite surface proteins, or if it acts independently. Identify any binding partners. 

3. Explore if MASP49 is immunogenic in animal models and humans, and if antibodies against it could confer protection against T. cruzi infection. Test MASP49 as a potential vaccine candidate.

4. Conduct a detailed structural analysis of MASP49 using X-ray crystallography to identify key binding domains and glycosylation sites. Use this information for rational drug design against MASP49.

5. Perform a comprehensive study of the roles and binding partners of other MASP family members during T. cruzi infection. Knockout or overexpress MASPs in parasites to determine their individual and collective contributions.
