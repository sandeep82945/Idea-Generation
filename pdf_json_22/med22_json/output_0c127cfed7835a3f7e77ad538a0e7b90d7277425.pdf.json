    "abstractText": "(1) Background: Phenotypic diversity and long-term health outcomes of individuals with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) have been described in detail. However, there is limited information on the burden on affected families. (2) Methods: To evaluate the family burden in parents with children suffering from UCDs, we used validated questionnaires. Socio-demographic characteristics were evaluated, and an adapted version of the Parental Need Scale for Rare Diseases questionnaire was used. The survey was conducted in families of UCD patients cared for at the University Children\u2019s Hospital Heidelberg. (3) Results: From April to November 2021, 59 participants were interviewed (mothers n = 34, fathers n = 25). The affected patients most frequently suffered from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC-D) (female n = 12, male n = 12), followed by argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency (ASS-D, n = 13) and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASL-D, n = 8). About one-third of the participants were \u201cdissatisfied\u201d or \u201cextremely dissatisfied\u201d with health professionals\u2019 disease knowledge. In addition, 30% of the participants reported a medium or high need for \u201cadditional information on the development of their children\u201d, and 44% reported a medium or high need \u201cfor information on available services\u201d. A majority of 68% reported a need for additional support regarding services such as support groups (42%) or psychological counseling (29%). (4) Conclusions: Our study indicates that there is an unmet need for sufficient information about the development of children with UCDs, as well as for information about available support services for families with UCD patients. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of establishing or improving family-centered care approaches. This pilot study may serve as a template for the assessment of the family burden associated with other inherited metabolic diseases.",

            "text": "Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) comprise more than 1600 disorders, which are classified into 130 groups based on defects of the respective biochemical metabolic pathways [1]. Most IMDs are rare diseases with low incidences. In the European Union, a disease with an incidence of <1:2000 is considered rare. Patients with rare diseases such as urea cycle disorders (UCD) are cared for in a variety of clinics, most of which are local. The medical expertise and experience of the specific center can vary widely [2]. There can be significant differences in infrastructure, diagnostic procedures, time to diagnosis, strategies and outcomes, and these differences can have a negative impact on health outcomes. In the European Union and other industrialized countries, the care of patients with rare diseases has received special attention in recent years [3]. The newly established\nChildren 2022, 9, 712. https://doi.org/10.3390/children9050712 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/children\nChildren 2022, 9, 712 2 of 15\nEuropean Reference Networks (ERNs) for rare diseases provide a platform for the harmonization of patient care and knowledge exchange across different European countries. Urea cycle disorders comprise a group of IMDs of ureagenesis, which is required for the irreversible elimination of excess nitrogen through the formation of dialyzable urea from ammonium and bicarbonate in periportal hepatocytes. The overall prevalence of UCDs ranges between 1 in 35,000 and 1 in 52,000 in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, with OTC deficiency (OTC-D) being the most frequent subtype (>50%) [4,5]. Other UCD subtypes are argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency (ASS-D) as the second most frequent disease subtype (19%), followed by argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASL-D, 11.5%) and carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1-D, 4.5%) [5,6]. UCDs are caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding enzymes or transporters of the urea cycle [7]. The majority of individuals with an UCD manifests with recurrent hyperammonemic episodes precipitated by catabolism, protein-rich meals, medications such as valproic acid, and other trigger factors [8]. The first symptoms may occur during the newborn period or later in life, reflecting the high phenotypic diversity of UCDs [6,9,10]. The degree of enzymatic dysfunction determines the metabolic disease course and its phenotypic severity, i.e., individuals with lower residual enzymatic activity are confronted with higher peak plasma ammonium concentrations at initial presentation and develop more often hyperammonemic decompensations during their disease course [11,12]. Importantly, the level of plasma ammonium at disease manifestation is associated with the neurocognitive outcome, which is most pronounced for mitochondrial UCDs [4,10,13]. Hyperglutaminergic hyperammonemia is the biochemical hallmark of most UCDs. Without immediate therapy, it induces a cascade of synergistically acting mechanisms, such as excitotoxicity, bioenergetic impairment and astrocytic swelling that often results in life-threatening encephalopathy, brain edema, irreversible brain damage and can cause a severe neurodevelopment disorder [14,15]. Hyperammonemia-associated symptoms range from somnolence, nausea, vomiting, liver failure, to seizures, multiorgan failure, acute encephalopathy, and death [16]. The prognosis of UCDs is strongly influenced by the duration of coma and peak ammonia levels in the setting of the initial decompensation [11,12]. In addition, metabolic decompensation can contribute to a worsening neurologic outcome and is therefore a particular burden for parents and caregivers [13,16,17].International recommendations, currently in their second version, have been published for the treatment of UCDs [18]. The long-term management of patients with UCD consists of a low-protein diet, which must be balanced and supplemented to avoid deficiencies of essential amino acids, trace elements or vitamins, and the use of nitrogen scavengers [18]. The acute treatment includes detoxification of ammonia, which often requires extracorporeal hemodialysis, and the use of intravenous drugs that act as nitrogen scavengers [18\u201321]. Liver transplantation may be another option [18]. The majority of UCDs are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner [22]. OTC-D is inherited in an X-linked manner [23,24], which leads to severe courses in hemizygous male individuals, while the clinical course in females is extremely variable [23]. So far, UCDs are not part of the German newborn screening program [18]. Currently, the first pilot studies are ongoing to evaluate newborn screening for ASS and ASL deficiency [15,25]. The European registry and network for Intoxication-Type Metabolic Diseases (\u201cEIMD\u201d) (https://www.eimd-registry.com (accessed on 23 March 2022) gathers comprehensive information on the clinical and biochemical natural history and outcome of UCDs. The goals of the E-IMD include the achievement of a better understanding of the natural history, diagnosis, and treatment options of the diseases, as well as the establishment of guidelines to reduce inequalities in care [2]. However, there is limited information on the psychosocial burden of affected families and their need for support. Previous studies focused on patients and their challenges associated with a UCD. Specifically, it has been shown that a child\u2019s disease has often an impact on the entire family, as it affects the dynamics of the family and can result in a significant parental burden [26\u201330]. The time-consuming care for a patient with a UCD requires adjustments for parents, such as a strict dietary control [18], frequent appointments with specialists,\nChildren 2022, 9, 712 3 of 15\nand a constant risk of metabolic decompensation. It is assumed that the genetic origin as well as the associated uncertain physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning of the child puts an additional burden on parents [31]. Furthermore, the parental burden can in turn have a negative impact on the affected children and siblings [29]. The difficulties experienced by the parents of children with rare diseases can involve emotional aspects, the relationship with the partner, the own behavior, as well as the process of diagnostics and the challenges of the health care system [32,33]. By understanding the support needs of families with affected children, needs-adapted concepts can be established and further improved, harboring the chance to reduce the family burden in the future [34]. The aim of this work was to evaluate the family burden in parents of children with UCDs in Germany and to assess the parental needs for specific support. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of gender, age, UCD subtype, and income on family burden."

All E-IMD UCD patients were identified, duplications caused by siblings or mothers with diagnosed OTC-D were excluded. In total, 54 E-IMD families including 108 parents were eligible to participate. In addition, one family including 2 parents of a patient with lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) treated at the University Children\u2019s Hospital Heidelberg and not registered with E-IMD declared interest to participate. Signed consent of all parents to participate in the study was obtained. From April to November 2021, parents were contacted and interviewed by phone or during outpatient visits. All parents were interviewed individually and independently of each other. Out of the 110 eligible parents, 59 (from 46 families) answered the questionnaire (response rate = 53.6%); 22 of the 110 parents screened could not be reached during the data collection period. Other reasons for excluding screened participants were lack of consent (n = 15), lack of German language skills (n = 10) or death (n = 4)."

Subsequently, a shortened 28-item version of the PNS was consented. The shortened questionnaire was translated into German by two independent translators (MWH/BW). After backward translation into English by a native Speaker, a German version was compiled. The final version (Supplementary File S1) included 28 items, divided into 6 sections: (1) Understanding the disease (4 items), (2) Working with health professionals (4 items), (3) Financial needs (3 items), (4) Information needs and social, physical, spiritual, and psychological needs (15 items), (5) Need for further support, as well as (6) a free text answer option. The items of the first four categories were answered using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 represented no need for support/full satisfaction, while 5 represented a high need for support/complete dissatisfaction. The need for additional support services was assessed by a list of options to choose from and a free-text field.

It has been shown before that medical care for IMDs outside of specialized centers can be unsatisfactory, especially in emergency situations [37]. On the one hand, our results revealed that most parents were extremely satisfied or satisfied with working with health professionals and the overall support (Figure 1b). In this context, it is important to consider that the participants in this single-center pilot study were cared for by the Department of Pediatric Neurology and Metabolic Medicine at the Centre for Child and Adolescent Medicine University of Heidelberg, which employs IMD specialists. On the other hand, about one-third indicated a dissatisfaction with the health professionals\u2019 knowledge about their child\u2019s disease (Figure 1b). This dissatisfaction might be related to the lack of information on the disease and therapeutic options, as difficulties caused by a lack of knowledge about the disease and a lack of disease-specific support services are common for rare diseases [34]. At the same time, low awareness on rare diseases is often associated with delays in diagnosis and treatment, which in turn leads to an increased burden [33]. In particular, non-specialized health professionals often lack the necessary experience and knowledge [39]. Therefore, there is a need to raise awareness of rare metabolic disorders such as UCDs and improve the medical care outside of specialized facilities. For this, lowthreshold collaborations within specialized networks on a national or even international level can be helpful. Patient representatives should be included in these networks.

This need might be related to the difficulty of arising questions about the disease that cannot be clearly answered, mostly because of a lack of evidence-based information [40]. The need for information, expressed by the parents, underscores the importance of regular appointments and assessments at specialized facilities for the whole family to keep the families informed of the latest developments in their IMD, answer their questions, and respond to emerging needs [36]. At the same time, parents\u2019 needs highlight the importance of the scientific support of medical care through the establishment of natural history studies and deep phenotyping approaches. For rare diseases, patient registries are thought to be key instruments to achieve a sufficient sample size for the evaluation of the clinical course as well as of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. In addition, the information supply could be improved through the development of quality-controlled web-based databases and information systems accessible through websites or apps, which could facilitate the accessibility to easy-to-understand knowledge for affected families."

In this study, 68% of the participants indicated an unmet need for one or more of the proposed services, especially the need for support groups and psychological counseling. These findings underscore the importance of support services such as parent advocacy groups and strongly suggest their promotion. Due to the rarity of the diseases and their geographical distribution, the parents of affected children often lack contact with a peer group with similar experiences [34]. In recent years, however, the possibilities for networking via the internet have become more popular and versatile and offer opportunities for affected families to connect. This contact can be beneficial through emotional support and additional information, which could support the parents in dealing with the disease [33,39]."

A weakness of our study is the small sample size and, particularly, the uneven distribution within the subgroups. Nevertheless, trends can be derived regarding the need for support. Overall, the reported need for financial support was low (Figure 1c). This is presumably due to the fact that in Germany, medical expenses are in most cases completely covered by the national health care system [36]. In contrast, about a quarter of the respondents indicated an additional need for financial counseling. Furthermore, it could be shown that parents who indicated difficulties with managing their income more often indicated a high need for support in the following sections of the questionnaire (Section 3.3). This is in line with previous studies, which showed a financial burden on the parents of children with an IMD, especially those with a required dietary treatment [26,28]. The analysis of the data according to the diagnosis subtype also showed differences (Section 3.4), whereby the unequal and sometimes very small group size of the subgroups must also be considered here. However, a tendency can be shown that the parents of patients with HHH syndrome, CPS1-D or LPI, disorders that have a very low incidence in common (approx. < 1:2,000,000 [5]), more often indicated a high need for support. This may be related to the lack of evidence-based information and peer support [34,40], which may be even more pronounced for these very rare diseases. Stratification by sex of the patients revealed\nChildren 2022, 9, 712 12 of 15\na difference in burden among the parents of patients with OTC-D, as the parents of female patients with OTC-D more frequently reported a need for genetic counseling (Section 3.4).

UCD patients usually require lifelong therapy, which is why appropriate care is also necessary in adulthood [41\u201343]. Such transitions are challenging for the health care system, as well as for patients and caregivers [38], and the access to services that promote the transition to an independent adult life of patients with IMDs is limited [36]. This suggests that depending on the age of the patient, varying difficulties and burdens for the parents could be in focus. When stratified by the age groups of the patients, the results showed some differences in the need for additional support services (Section 3.5). Overall, the evaluation showed that parents of older patients in group 3 (12\u201318 years) and 4 (>18 years) more often had no need for additional support services. Those results are in line with previous studies on the psychological adjustment of parents of chronically ill children, which suggest that good adjustment is possible, but still the risk of poor adjustment is significantly higher than in the general population [29,30,44]."

This consideration neglects possible differences between care in different sectors of the health care system. Furthermore, national differences in care and support, e.g., due to different health care systems, must be assumed, so follow-up studies should include an international perspective. The European collaboration of the E-IMD network may be helpful for this. In addition, because of the rarity of UCD-associated diseases, only single families could be studied for some enzyme defects. Therefore, confirmation of the results in a larger collective would be desirable. Another limitation is the partly deficient language skills and e-health competence, which may have influenced the accuracy of the responses of the respective participants. Furthermore, it must be considered that the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the pandemic and changes in the daily lives as well as in the healthcare systems may have put an additional burden on the families during the study period [45] and biased the results of this study. A strength of this study is found in the fact that despite being single-center study on a rare disease, a high number of participants, especially of male responders, was achieved. The study population covered a wide age range of UCD subtypes. Despite an overall small study group, trends could be identified. Through the multidisciplinary team of contributors, versatile views and interpretations of the results could be achieved. The use and adaptation of validated questionnaires and the online implementation makes the survey easily applicable to other disorders in multi-center studies."
