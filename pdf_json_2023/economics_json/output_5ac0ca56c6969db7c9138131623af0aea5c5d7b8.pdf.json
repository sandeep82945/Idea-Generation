            "text": "The distortion of voting rules was introduced by Procaccia and Rosenschein [2006] as a way to implicitly measure the utilitarian performance of a voting rule. The distortion of a voting rule given some ordinal preference profile, is the worst-case approximation factor to the social welfare this voting rule can achieve, among all utility profiles consistent with the ordinal preferences. Without any additional assumptions on these utility profiles, no voting rule can achieve any constant factor guarantees. This motivated Anshelevich et al. [2018] to study the special case of metric utility profiles, i.e., utility profiles for which a metric space exists, in which the voters and candidates lie, such that the utility of a voter for a candidate is precisely the distance between them. For such utility profiles, a lower bound of 3 on the distortion of any rule was quickly established, while it was also shown that the Copeland rule (in fact, any rule selecting from the uncovered set) achieves a distortion of 5. This upper bound of 5 was subsequently lowered by Kempe [2020] and Munagala and Wang [2019], until finally Gkatzelis et al. [2020] achieved an upper bound of 3 through a rather \u201ccomplex\u201d rule dubbed Plurality Matching. This rule was subsequently simplified by K\u0131z\u0131lkaya and Kempe [2022] to the so-called Plurality Veto rule.\nIn this paper, we show that the Plurality Matching and Plurality Veto rules are related closely to three different settings in social choice: (i) The Proportional Veto Core by Moulin [1981], (ii) the concept of Proportionality for Solid Coalitions from multiwinner voting (see, for instance, Aziz and Lee [2020] or Brill and Peters [2023]), and (iii) the Matching under Preferences setting [Bogomolnaia and Moulin, 2001]. In fact, we give an equivalent formulation of\n\u2217jannik.peters@tu-berlin.de\nthe Plurality Matching concept in all three settings. Using this equivalence, the Plurality Veto rule, the Vote-by-Veto rule [Moulin, 1981], and the Serial Dictatorship rule [Abdulkadirog\u0306lu and So\u0308nmez, 1998] are instantiations of the same rule. Further, Phragme\u0301n\u2019s Ordered Rule [Janson, 2016], Probabilistic Serial [Bogomolnaia and Moulin, 2001], and the \u201cVeto by consumption\u201d rule [Ianovski and Kondratev, 2021] can also be treated as instantiations of the same rule and thus lead to a new rule with an optimal metric distortion of 3."

            "text": "Throughout the paper, we assume that we are given a set N = [n] of voters and a set C = {c1, . . . , cm} of candidates. Further, each voter i \u2208 N has a strict and complete preference list \u227bi\u2286 C \u00d7 C with \u227b= (\u227bi)i\u2208N forming the preference profile. Together, (N,C,\u227b) form our election instance. For a given profile \u227b, we let \u227bR be the preference profile such that c \u227bRi c\n\u2032 if and only if c\u2032 \u227bi c, i.e., the reversed preference profile. Further, we write ci cj if and only if ci \u227b cj or ci = cj . For a set N\n\u2032 \u2286 N of voters and sets C\u2032, C\u2032\u2032 \u2286 C of candidates we write that C\u2032 \u227bN \u2032 C \u2032\u2032 if and only if c\u2032 \u227bi c \u2032\u2032 for all i \u2208 N \u2032, c\u2032 \u2208 C\u2032, and c\u2032\u2032 \u2208 C\u2032\u2032.\nAdditionally, we need the notion of cloned candidates. For a given frequency function f : C \u2192 N0, the instance (N,Cf ,\u227bf ) is the instance in which every candidate c is replaced by f(c) clones in every preference list. The ranking between the clones is arbitrary but fixed across voters, and candidates with f(c) = 0 are deleted. We denote by plu(c) the plurality score of candidate c, by boti(C\n\u2032) the worst ranked candidate c \u2208 C\u2032 by voter i. Hence, the instance (N,Cplu,\u227bplu) denotes the instance in which every candidate is cloned as many times as they appear first in any preference profile. We not that for this special instance n = m holds.\nFor any c \u2208 C and N \u2032 \u2286 N we define\nDc(N \u2032) := {c\u2032 \u2208 C : c i c \u2032 for some i \u2208 N \u2032}\nas the set of all candidates which are not ranked better than c by at least one voter in N \u2032. Note that, by definition, c \u2208 Dc(N \u2032) for all c \u2208 C and non-empty N \u2032 \u2286 N .\nWe say that a utility function u : C \u2192 R+ is consistent with a preference list \u227b if ci \u227b cj implies u(ci) \u2264 u(cj), i.e., the goal is to select the candidate with the lowest social cost. A utility profile U = (ui)i\u2208N is a collection of utility functions such that ui is consistent with \u227bi. For a given utility profile U and candidate c the social welfare of c is sw(c, U) := \u2211 i\u2208N ui(c).\nWe call a utility profile metric if there exists a metric space (N \u222aC, d) with ui(c) = d(i, c), i.e., if there is a function d : (N \u222a C)2 \u2192 R+ such that for any i, j, k \u2208 N\u222aC it holds that (i) d(i, j) = 0 if and only if i = j, (ii) d(i, j) = d(j, i), and (iii) d(i, k) \u2264 d(i, j) + d(j, k).\nGiven a preference profile \u227b, let U(\u227b) be the set of all metric utility profiles consistent with the preference profile.

            "heading": "3 Plurality Matching and Domination Graphs",
            "text": "To tackle the problem of designing a voting rule achieving a metric distortion of exactly 3, Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah [2020] introduced the Plurality Matching rule, based on the so-called domination graph.\nDefinition 1. Given a candidate c, the domination graph G(c) = (V \u222a C,Ec) is the bipartite graph consisting of the set of voters on the one side, the set of candidates on the other side, with an edge between voter i and candidate c\u2032 if and only if c i c\u2032.\nA fractional perfect matching is a functionM : Ec \u2192 R\u22650 with \u2211 e\u2208\u03b4(i) M(e) =\n1 for all i \u2208 V and \u2211\ne\u2208\u03b4(c) M(e) = n m for all c \u2208 C. As one of their main contri-\nbutions, Gkatzelis et al. [2020] were able to show that there is always a candidate c whose domination graph has a fractional perfect matching.\nTheorem 1 ([Gkatzelis et al., 2020]). For any election, there is a candidate c such that G(c) admits a fractional perfect matching. Such a candidate can be found in polynomial time.\nWhether G(c) admits a fractional perfect matching can be verified in polynomial time using a generalization of Hall\u2019s Theorem.\nLemma 2 ([Gkatzelis et al., 2020]). Given a candidate c, the domination graph G(c) admits a fractional perfect matching if and only if for any N \u2032 \u2286 N , it holds that |Dc(N \u2032)| \u2265 m|N \u2032|\nn .\nTo relate this to the distortion problem, Gkatzelis et al. [2020] further showed that for the special case in which candidates are cloned according to their plurality score, any candidate admitting such a fractional perfect matching has metric distortion of at most 3.\nTheorem 3 ([Gkatzelis et al., 2020]). Given an instance (N,C,\u227b), consider the instance (N,Cplu,\u227bplu) in which every candidate c appears as many times as they are ranked first by a voter. Any candidate c whose domination graph G(c) admits a fractional perfect matching in the instance (N,Cplu,\u227bplu), has metric distortion of at most 3 in (N,C,\u227b).\nALGORITHM 1: Plurality Veto Rule\n1 Create instance (N,Cplu,\u227bplu); 2 for i \u2208 [n\u2212 1] do 3 Cplu \u2190 Cplu \\ boti(Cplu) 4 end 5 return last remaining candidate in Cplu;\nWe call such a candidate a plurality matching winner. As such a candidate always exists according to Theorem 1, there is also always a candidate with metric distortion of at most 3. However, while this candidate always exists, selecting it via simply iterating over all candidates and checking whether their domination graph admits such a matching, is somewhat unsatisfying and unnatural when comparing it to other voting rules, especially as it is not obvious (without the involved proof of Gkatzelis et al. [2020]), that such a candidate exists.\nThis motivated K\u0131z\u0131lkaya and Kempe [2022] to introduce a simple rule which can always select a plurality matching winner: The plurality veto rule.\nWe state the rule in Algorithm 1 for the special case of n = m in the instance (N,Cplu,\u227bplu). For the general version, called fractional veto rule, which can also be used to show Theorem 1, see the paper by K\u0131z\u0131lkaya and Kempe [2022]."

            "text": "Unrelated to the previous distortion considerations, Moulin [1981, 1982] introduced the proportional veto core, which we present here in the formulation of Ianovski and Kondratev [2021]. The goal of the proportional veto core is to give groups of voters the right to veto candidates they do not like. The power to veto should be distributed in a proportional fashion: an \u03b1-fraction of the voters should be able to veto an \u03b1-fraction of the candidates. To formalize this, for any group of votersN \u2032 \u2286 N , we say that the veto power of N \u2032 is v(N \u2032) = \u2308m|N \u2032|\nn \u2309\u22121.\nA candidate c is now considered to be vetoed, if there is some group N \u2032 of voters which rank at least m\u2212 v(N \u2032) candidates all better than c, that is, they could veto v(N \u2032) candidates together with c.\nDefinition 2. A candidate c is vetoed if there is some set N \u2032 \u2286 N of voters and set C\u2032 \u2286 C of candidates with c /\u2208 C\u2032 such that |C\u2032| \u2265 m \u2212 v(N \u2032) and C\u2032 \u227bN \u2032 C \\C\u2032. The proportional veto core consists of all alternatives which are not vetoed.\nThe proportional veto core is non-empty [Moulin, 1981, 1982] and can be computed using the voting by veto tokens rule introduced by Moulin [1981] and further analyzed by Ianovski and Kondratev [2021]. This rule works exactly the same as the fractional veto rule of K\u0131z\u0131lkaya and Kempe [2022] and can be computed in polynomial time [Ianovski and Kondratev, 2021]. Additionally,\nboth Moulin [1983] and Ianovski and Kondratev [2021, Proposition 21] showed that a candidate is in the proportional veto core if and only if it can be computed by the voting by veto tokens rule.\nFurther, Ianovski and Kondratev [2021] introduced the \u201cVote by consumption\u201d rule, which also selects from the proportional veto core. Intuitively, their rule works as follows: all voters simultaneously and with the same speed give score to their lowest ranked candidate. Once a candidate reaches a score of 1 this candidate is eliminated and the voters move on to their next worst candidate. The last candidate remaining wins. As pointed out by Ianovski and Kondratev [2021], this rule is anonymous and can be computed in polynomial time as well."

            "text": "Next, we turn to another equivalent formulation of the proportional veto core. For this, we use the well-known notion of proportionality for solid coalitions (PSC) [Dummett, 1984]. It was introduced in the context of proportional committee selection with ranked preferences, as a way to axiomatically measure whether a committee is proportional. In the committee selection problem, instead of selecting a single winner, a set of k winners is selected. Sets W \u2286 C are referred to as committees.\nDefinition 3. A committee W of size k satisfies weak Droop proportionality for solid coalitions (weak-PSC) if there is no group N \u2032 of voters and set C\u2032 of candidates with |N \u2032| > |C \u2032|n\nk+1 such that C \u2032 \\W 6= \u2205 and C\u2032 \u227bN \u2032 C \\ C\u2032.\nIn a nutshell, if a group of voters agrees on a prefix in their rankings and could afford this prefix, the candidates in the prefix need to be included in the committee. Rules satisfying this notion include Phragme\u0301n\u2019s sequential rule for ordinal ballots [Janson, 2016], the Droop variants of the expanding approvals rule [Aziz and Lee, 2020], and the well-studied Single Transferable Vote (STV) [Tideman, 1995].\nInterestingly enough, Phragme\u0301n\u2019s sequential rule for ordinal ballots behaves equivalently to veto-by-consumption run on the reversed preferences profile: the first k candidates discarded by veto-by-consumption on profile \u227bR, are exactly the k candidates elected by Phragme\u0301n\u2019s sequential rule.\nThis is no coincidence, however, as we show in the next section."

Then there is a group N \u2032 \u2286 N of voters and set C\u2032 \u2286 C of candidates with c /\u2208 C\u2032, |C\u2032| \u2265 m \u2212 \u2308m|N \u2032|\nn \u2309 + 1, and C\u2032 \u227bN \u2032 {c}. Thus, we know that |Dc(N \u2032)| \u2264\n\u2308m|N \u2032| n \u2309 \u2212 1 < m|N \u2032| n\nand by Lemma 2 the domination graph G(c) does not admit a perfect fractional matching.\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii): Next, assume that the committee C \\ {c} does not satisfy weakPSC in the instance (N,C,\u227bR). Thus, there is a set N \u2032 of voters and a set C\u2032 of candidates with c \u2208 C\u2032 such that C\u2032 \u227bN \u2032 C \\C\u2032 and |C\u2032| < |N \u2032|(k+1) n = |N \u2032|m n . Since, |C\u2032| is integral, we also get that |C \\ C\u2032| = m \u2212 |C\u2032| \u2265 m \u2212 \u2308m|N \u2032|\nn \u2309 + 1\nand hence, the set C \\ C\u2032 together with N \u2032 blocks c. (iii) \u21d2 (i): Finally, we assume that the domination graph of c does not admit a fractional perfect matching. Then by Lemma 2 there is some group N \u2032 of voters with |Dc(N \u2032)| < m|N \u2032| n , and therefore the candidate set {c\u2032 \u2208 C : c \u227bN \u2032 c\u2032} = {c\u2032 \u2208 C : c\u2032 \u227bRN \u2032 c} together with N \u2032 witnesses a weak-PSC violation.\nThus, all rules for either selecting from the proportional veto core or selecting committees satisfying weak-PSC can also be turned into rules achieving a metric distortion of 3 by applying them to the instance (N,Cplu,\u227bplu). These include the anonymous veto-by-consumption rule (or Phragme\u0301n\u2019s sequential rule for ordinal ballots), but also committee selection rules such as STV or EAR, which satisfy weak-PSC [Aziz and Lee, 2020]."

            "text": "Finally, we turn to our fourth setting: Matching under Preferences. More specifically, we investigate the random assignment problem of Bogomolnaia and Moulin [2001]. Like Ianovski and Kondratev [2021], we observe that the Probabilistic Serial rule of Bogomolnaia and Moulin [2001] can be seen as running Phragme\u0301n\u2019s sequential rule for k = m (or the veto-by-consumption rule for the reversed preference profile) and interpreting the \u201ceaten part\u201d as the probabilities.\nTo stay consistent with the notation, we also assume that we are given a set N of voters, C of candidates and a preference profile \u227b. Further, we assume that we are given a restriction k on the number of candidates matched. Now, a random assignment \u00b5 : N\u00d7C \u2192 R\u22650 is a function assigning each voter-candidate pair a probability to be matched. That is, \u2211 i\u2208N \u00b5(i, c) \u2264 1 for each c \u2208 C. Further, to implement the constraint of at most k candidates being matched, we assume that \u2211 c\u2208C \u00b5(i, c) = k n for each i \u2208 N , that is, each voter is matched with the same probability. We note that this is the same as a price system in\nthe committee selection literature, [Peters and Skowron, 2020, Brill and Peters, 2023].\nSuch a random assignment can also be seen as a lottery over matchings. Given a set of matchings M1, . . . ,M\u2113 and probabilities p1, . . . , p\u2113 \u2208 (0, 1] with\u2211\ni\u2208[\u2113] pi = 1, we say that this set implements \u00b5 if \u00b5(i, c) = \u2211\nj\u2208[\u2113] : M(i)=c pj . The support of \u00b5 are now all matchings M is of size k that are in some set implementing \u00b5.\nFinally, we note that the two popular assignment mechanisms, Random Priority and Probabilistic Serial, can easily be adapted to this setting of matching at most k items: Random Priority by ending the process after k items have been picked, and Probabilistic Serial by only running it for a time of k\nn .\nRandom Priority and Probabilistic Serial are both known to satisfy ex-post efficiency, i.e., the actual allocations they randomize over are Pareto efficient. We formalize this as follows.\nDefinition 4. A matching M of size k is Pareto efficient, if there is no matching M \u2032 of size k such that M \u2032(i) i M(i) for every i \u2208 N and M \u2032(i) \u227bi M(i) for some i \u2208 N .\nFurther, we say that a random assignment is ex-post efficient if every matching in its support is Pareto efficient.\nWe can show that Pareto optimality gives us another equivalent formulation of the proportional veto core, at least in the case n = m. Thus, any ex-post Pareto optimal mechanism can also be used to select from the proportional veto core in this special case.\nTheorem 5. Given a voting instance (N,C,\u227b) with |N | = |C|, a candidate c is in the proportional veto core if and only if in the instance (N,C,\u227bR) there is a Pareto optimal matching of size m\u2212 1 matching every candidate in C \\ {c}.\nProof. First, if c is not in the proportional veto core, there is a group N \u2032 of voters and C\u2032 of candidates with |C\u2032| \u2265 m \u2212 \u2308m|N \u2032|\nn \u2309 + 1 = n \u2212 |N \u2032| + 1 and\nC\u2032 \u227bN \u2032 {c} and therefore {c} \u227bR C\u2032. Since the members of N \u2032 are matched to at least |N \u2032| \u2212 1 items, there must be one voter in N \u2032 matched to someone worse than c. Hence, this matching was not Pareto optimal, since this voter could have been matched to c instead.\nOn the other hand, assume that there is no Pareto optimal matching of size m \u2212 1 matching every candidate in C \\ {c}. It is easy to see that this is equivalent to there not being any matching of size m \u2212 1 which only matches voters to candidates they prefer to c (for a proof see [Hosseini et al., 2021, Theorem 2]). Thus, by Hall\u2019s Theorem, there must be a set N \u2032 \u2286 N of voters with C\u2032 := {c\u2032 \u2208 C : c\u2032 \u227bi c for some i \u2208 N \u2032} such that |C\u2032| \u2264 |N \u2032|\u22122. However, then C\u2032 and N \u2032 witness a violation of c being in the proportional veto core.\nWhile this applies to the special case relevant for distortion (in which n = m) it does not do so in general. For example, consider an instance with 4 voters and 3 candidates. Two of the voters have the ranking c1 \u227b c2 \u227b c3 while two\nother ones have the ranking c3 \u227b c2 \u227b c1. Here, two voters have a veto power of 3 \u2212 \u2308 3\u00b724 \u2309+ 1 = 2. Thus, neither c1 nor c3 is in the proportional veto core of this instance. However, the matching which matches the first two voters to c3 and c2 is Pareto optimal in the instance \u227bR. Hence, we leave a generalization beyond the case of n = m for future work.\nFurther, we note that by the equivalence between Pareto optimality and the serial dictatorship mechanism [Abdulkadirog\u0306lu and So\u0308nmez, 1998], the existence of a Pareto optimal matching of size m\u22121 matching every candidate in C\\{c} is equivalent to there being a permutation \u03c3(1), . . . , \u03c3(n) of the voters, such that the last voter \u03c3(n) picks candidate c in the serial dictatorship mechanism, thus also drawing the connection to matchings of size m."

[2020] and the plurality veto rule of K\u0131z\u0131lkaya and Kempe [2022] are inherently related to three concepts from social choice: The proportional veto core, proportionality for solid coalitions, and Pareto optimal matchings. This gives rise to several more possible algorithms achieving an optimal metric distortion of 3. Most prominently, Phragme\u0301n\u2019s ordinal method (or, equivalently, veto-by-consumption or probabilistic serial) can be turned into such a rule, by cloning each candidate according to their plurality score and then picking the last candidate elected by Phragme\u0301n\u2019s ordinal method for k = n (or, equivalently, the only remaining one for k = n\u2212 1).\nSo far, all methods known to achieve a metric distortion of 3 rely on this cloning step. Thus, it would be an interesting direction for future research to explore whether there is a voting rule with distortion 3 which works without this step."
