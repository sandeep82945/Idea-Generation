    "abstractText": "Starting with ferrocyanide ions in acidic aqueous solution, cyano-ferrate(II) species are post-synthetically grafted to the nodes of a mesoporous zirconium-based MOF, NU-1000. As indicated by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, grafting occurs by substitution of cyanide ligands by node-based hydroxo and oxo ligands, rather than by substitution of node aqua ligands by cyanide ligands as bridges between Fe(II) and Zr(IV). The installed moieties yield a broad absorption band that is tentatively ascribed to ironto-zirconium charge-transfer. Consistent with Fe(III/II) redox activity, a modest fraction of the installed iron complexes are directly electrochemically addressable.",

The installed moieties yield a broad absorption band that is tentatively ascribed to ironto-zirconium charge-transfer. Consistent with Fe(III/II) redox activity, a modest fraction of the installed iron complexes are directly electrochemically addressable.\nKEYWORDS: Ferrocyanide; Post-synthetic modification; Redox hopping; Zirconium-based MOF\n1. INTRODUCTION\nDue to their regular and tunable porosity and ultrahigh specific surface area, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs)1-2 have been recognized as promising materials for a broad range of applications including: chemical separations,3-4 gas storage and release,5-7 chemical sensing,8-9 catalysis,10-13 charge storage,14-16 and ionic transport.17-18 One of the most attractive characteristics of MOFs is the tunable intra-framework chemical functionality provided by either the spatially well-aligned metal-based nodes or organic linkers. Such intra-framework functional groups may allow the installation of high-density, well-separated, and accessible active sites within the entire framework \u2013 sites that are potentially functional for chemical catalysis, photocatalysis, and/or electrocatalysis. Various liquid- and vaporphase post-synthetic methods have been used to attach active moieties to either the linkers or the metal-based nodes of MOFs.19-22 For MOF electrochemical applications, a desirable additional property is electrical conductivity \u2013 an inherently challenging demand, since most MOFs, under most conditions, are electrically insulating. One approach to imparting conductivity is to tether redox-active moieties, such as ferrocene (Fc), to MOF nodes, and then rely upon electron or hole exchange between neighboring neutral and oxidized, or reduced and neutral forms of the tethered species.23-27 This mechanism of charge propagation is often termed \u201credox hopping\u201d and can be contrasted with approaches that instead impart conductivity by introducing band-like electronic properties.28-30 It also can be contrasted with approaches that rely upon permeation of MOF channels with a solution containing dissolved redox-active species (for example, methylviologen dications (MV+2)) that physically shuttle electrons or holes between immobilized electrocatalysts and an underlying electrode.31\nHere we return to the notion of conduction via repetitive charge hopping between MOF tethered/immobilized redox species. We report on our efforts to immobilize ferrocyanide within\nthe mesoporous MOF, NU-1000,32 and to capitalize on its reversible oxidation to ferricyanide. Perhaps the most widely used redox couple for routine electrochemical studies, apart from ferrocenium/ferrocene and MV2+/+, is ferri-/ferrocyanide, i.e. Fe(CN)6 3-/4-.\nNU-1000 consists of tetratopic 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoate)pyrene linkers and Zr6(\u03bc3-O)4(\u03bc3-OH)4(H2O)4(OH)4 8- nodes; see Figure 1. Each of the nodes is eight-connected, and ideally presents eight labile, or otherwise reactive, terminal aqua and hydroxo ligands, along with four potentially reactive, bridging hydroxos. Metal-cyanide complexes are known to bind at the surfaces of colloids and nanoparticulate films of TiO2 at low pH and to display metal-to-metal (cyanide complex to titanium) charge-transfer absorption bands in the visible region of the spectrum.33-37 Binding entails formation of Fe-CN-Ti linkages, likely by displacement of aqua ligands from the metal-oxide surface. Recognizing the close similarities in surface-attachment chemistry for zirconia versus titania and noting that the MOF\u2019s nodes are essentially tiny pieces of zirconia, we reasoned that similar binding of metal-cyanide complexes to NU1000 would be possible; such direct installations of metal-cyanide ions in MOFs have not been reported previously.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n2.1. Chemicals. All chemicals used for synthesizing the 1,3,6,8- tetrakis(p-benzoic acid)pyrene (H4TBAPy) linkers and NU1000 are the same as those reported before.38 Benzoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, \u226599.5%), ZrCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, \u226599.5%), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Fisher Chemical, \u226599.8%), N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) (Fisher Chemical, \u226598.5%), hydrochloric acid (HCl) (36.5-38.0%, Avantor), acetone (Fisher Chemical, \u226599.5%), potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate (Baker analyzed, 99.9%), sodium perchlorate (Aldrich, 98%), and sodium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) were used as received. Deionized water was used for preparing aqueous solutions.\n2.2. Synthesis of FeCN@NU-1000. H4TBAPy linker and NU1000 were synthesized according to the procedures reported in our previous study.38 For the synthesis of FeCN@NU-1000, 22.2 mL of 0.1 M HCl aqueous solution was prepared first in a microwave vial (Biotage\u00ae Microwave Reaction Kit, 10-20 mL) and purged with Ar gas for 15 min. Thereafter, 94 mg of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate was added into the solution and dissolved by sonication. Then, 60 mg of NU-1000 was added into the solution and the microwave vial was sealed with a cap with septum. Thereafter, Ar gas was continuously purged into the headspace in the vial through the cap for 5 min (with a gas outlet). After purging with Ar, the microwave vial was fully covered with aluminum foil and kept at room temperature for 3 days. The microwave vial was shaken periodically during the first two days. After 3 days of reaction, the aluminum foil covering the vial was removed; green precipitation was observed at the bottom of the microwave vial. The following washing step was conducted immediately. The solution was removed by a needle syringe through the cap, and 20 mL of water was added into the vial. The suspension was shaken and then kept in dark for overnight. This wash step was done with water for twice,\nfollowed by three times of washing with fresh acetone. After the final removal of acetone, the cap on the microwave vial was removed and the vial containing wet green solid was dried in an oven at 120 oC in air for overnight. The color of the sample turned brown after drying, and the obtained brown powder is designated as \u201cFeCN@NU-1000\u201d (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information).\n2.3. Synthesis of FeCN@SC-NU-1000. NU-1000 crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements (SC-NU1000) were synthesized following the procedure reported in our recent study.15 After the final washing of the SC-NU-1000 with DMF, the crystals (~60 mg) were washed with water twice and transferred into a microwave vial. Thereafter, the solution containing potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) trihydrate was prepared following the procedure mentioned before and being added into the microwave vial. The exposure hexacyanoferrate(II) was conducted for 3 days with all the following washing steps similar to those for the synthesis of FeCN@NU-1000. After the final washing step with acetone, the obtained green crystals were washed with ethanol three times and then solvent-evacuated by using supercritical CO2 delivered by a Tousimis Samdri-PVT3D (Rockville, MD) as described previously.39 The obtained crystals were further activated in an oven at 120 oC in air overnight, and the obtained sample was designated as FeCN@SCNU-1000 for single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements.\n2.4. Instrumentation. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku ATX-G workstation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were collected on a Hitachi SU8030. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were collected at 77K on an ASAP 2020 instrument (Micromeritics). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP\u2013OES) measurements were conducted on a Thermo iCAP 7600. UVvisible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the digested thin films were collected on a Shimadzu 1601 UV-vis spectrometer. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra (Shimadzu UV-3600) were collected from 1600 to 360 nm with a Harrick Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) powder was used as a reflector for baseline measurement. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were collected on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. Liquid N2 was used to cool the detector during the measurements, and all DRIFT measurements were conducted at room temperature with Ar flow. KBr was used as a background spectrum. The steady-state emission spectra of NU-\n1000 and FeCN@NU-1000 were measured on a Photon Technology International (PTI) QuantaMaster 400 fluorometer. The samples were excited at 380 nm and emission spectra were monitored from 400 to 700 nm. Finely ground MOF crystals were used for the measurements. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed with CHI 900 potentiostat. A platinum coil and Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 M) electrode (BASi) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The spin-coated thin film of FeCN@NU-1000 or NU-1000 deposited on an FTO substrate was served as the working electrode. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M NaClO4 aqueous solution.\nFor single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements, one crystal of FeCN@SC-NU-1000 was mounted on MicroMesh (MiTeGen) in paratone oil and transferred to the cold gas stream (100 K) of a Bruker APEX II CCD area detector equipped with Mo K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5 ) I\u03bcS microfocus source with MX optics.\nThe structure was determined by direct methods (SHELXS 2014/5) and refined by full-matrix least-squares refinement on F2 (SHELXL-2017/1) using the Yadokari-XG software package. Refinement results are summarized in Table S1 in Supporting Information. Disordered noncoordinated solvent molecules were removed using the PLATON SQUEEZE program.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nInstallation of cyano-ferrate(II) species in NU-1000 was conducted in an acidic aqueous solution in an air-free and dark environment, as described in the experimental section. (Thus, we capitalize on the known stability of Zr-MOFs in noncoordinating aqueous acid.40-42) Following solvent exchange and, for single-crystal X-ray measurements, treatment with supercritical CO2, the isolated material was heated under vacuum at 120 oC; again see the experimental section for details. The obtained material showing a brown color is designated as \u201cFeCN@NU1000\u201d. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of FeCN@NU-1000 reveals the same diffraction peaks as those appearing in both the experimental and simulated patterns of NU-1000, implying that crystallinity is largely retained and that the gross structure of the framework is unchanged. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of microcrystals of FeCN@NU1000 shows a rod-shape morphology, which is unchanged from that for unmodified NU-1000 (Figure S2a). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) line-scan measurements of individual crystallites indicate both iron and nitrogen are uniformly distributed within each crystallite (Figure S2b). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurements show that there, on average, 1.1 iron atoms, per hexa-zirconium node.\nFor single crystal X-ray diffraction studies, larger NU1000 crystals were grown from diethylformamide. These were then infiltrated and reacted with ferrocyanide in aqueous acid, as noted above. As shown in Figure 1, the installed Fe com-\nplexes are bound to the zirconium nodes and are sited exclusively in the c-pore, rather than the triangular or hexagonal channels/pores. (Note that the c-pores are geometrically orthogonal to the triangular and hexagonal channels and serve to interconnect them.) Closer inspection of the structure shows that attachment is achieved by Zr-oxo or Zr-hydroxo displacement of cyanide ligands on iron(II), rather than by Fe-CN displacement of node aqua ligands. Furthermore, two crystallographically independent Fe sites (Fe1 and Fe2) exist. Fe1 is linked to a pair of node-Zr ions via a pair of terminal hydroxo (or possibly oxo) ligands (see Figure 1c). Fe2 includes these links plus a third involving an oxygen anion linked to three node-Zr ions (see Figure 1d). Based on the linkages, Fe1 and Fe2 are tentatively formulated as [Fe(II)(CN)4(-OH)2] 4- and [Fe(II)(CN)3(-OH)2(O)]5-, rather than ferrocyanide.\nMultiple crystallographically equivalent sites exist for both Fe1 and Fe2; see Figure 1b. Taking account of the occupancies for different Fe1 and Fe2 sites, the crystallographically estimated loadings are 0.60 (Fe1) and 0.32 (Fe2) per Zr6-node \u2013 results that are reasonably consistent with the loading determined by ICP (1.1 Fe per Zr6).\nN2 adsorption-desorption experiments were conducted to investigate the porosity of FeCN@NU-1000. As indicated in the isotherms shown in Figure 3a, although the porosity of NU1000 decreases after exposure to ferrocyanide, the resulting FeCN@NU-1000 is still mesoporous. The Brunauer-EmmettTeller (BET) surface areas of NU-1000 and FeCN@NU-1000 are 2,100 and 1,460 m2/g, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) pore size distributions obtained from the nitrogen isotherms are shown in Figure 3b. A slight decrease in mesopore width accompanies shrinking pore size of mesopores can be observed after the sensitization of ferrocyanide ions; a similar change in mesopore width was observed in an earlier study of polyoxometalate installation in NU-1000.43\nFigure 4a shows diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of NU-1000 and FeCN@NU-1000. A peak at 3,674 cm-1, which is associated in the unmodified MOF with terminal and bridging \u2212OH groups on the nodes,44 is substantially less in FeCN@NU-1000, as are peaks at ca. 2,551 and 2,745 cm\u22121, associated in NU-1000 with H-bonded H2O and \u2212OH.44 These observations are broadly consistent with the aforementioned single crystal X-ray structure which indicates recruitment of the oxygen atoms of terminal and bridging hydroxo groups for binding cyano-ferrate species. A broad band at around 3,000-3,600 cm-1 attributable to physisorbed water also appears in the spectrum of FeCN@NU-1000. A strong and broad peak centered around 2,088 cm-1, attributable to C\u2261N stretching is present in the spectrum of FeCN@NU-1000. For\ncomparison, the C\u2261N stretch in the IR spectrum of ferrocyanide appears at 2,040 cm-1, while that for ferricyanide appears at 2,114 cm-1.45 Examining the 2,088 cm-1 peak for FeCN@NU1000 more closely, it appears to consist of multiple overlapping, but unresolved, peaks \u2013 possibly resulting from the presence of two chemically distinct cyano-ferrate species, as evinced by the single crystal X-ray structure. Alternatively, the cause could be the reduction in symmetry that accompanies ligand-substitution-based attachment of the iron complex to the node. Notably, a reduction in symmetry (albeit, without ligand substitution on iron) is readily evident in the infrared and Raman spectra for ferrocyanide bound to nanoparticulate TiO2. 24,46 Diffuse reflectance UV-visible (UV-vis) spectra of both NU-1000 and FeCN@NU-1000 were also measured, as shown in Figure 4b. A broad absorbance in the visible region, mostly overlapping with the absorbance from the pyrene-based linkers in NU-1000\nbut tailing out to 750 nm, can be observed in the UV-vis spectrum of FeCN@NU-1000. Subtraction of the NU-1000 spectrum from the spectrum of FeCN@NU-1000 results in a broad band with an apparent maximum at ~430 nm (although the accuracy of the maximum may be compromised by the large absorbances below 430 nm in the parent spectra). The observed band is reminiscent of the known charge-transferabsorbance for ferrocyanide in combination with TiO2 nanoparticles. 37 It is tempting to offer a similar assignment here, i.e. Fe(II)-to-Zr(IV) charge transfer, although a somewhat short maximum wavelength might be expected in view of the much more negative reduction potential for Zr(IV) relative to Ti(IV). Finally, as shown in Figure S4, the pyrene-linker-based fluorescence of the MOF is quenched for FeCN@NU-1000 \u2013 presumably due to electron transfer from the linker excited state to the cyano-ferrate complex.\nTo explore the electrochemical behavior of FeCN@NU1000, thin films were formed on conducting glass platforms (fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)) by spin coating, following a procedure reported previously.15, 47 As shown in Figure 5, cyclic voltammetry yields an anodic and cathodic peak pair centered at roughly 0.2 V and a weak second pair centered at roughly 0.38 V, versus Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 M) (the full-scale CV curves are shown in Figure S5). We ascribe these to cyano-ferrate(III/II) couples, and note that the single crystal X-ray structure shows that two chemically distinct cyano-ferrate species are present in FeCN@NU-1000. To quantify the amount of cyano-ferrate that\nis electrochemically accessible (on the tens of seconds timescale), chronoamperometry measurements were made (Figure S6a), with the total loading of cyano-ferrate per square centimeter of the film being obtained by UV-vis measurements as reported previously.15, 48 From the measurements only ~2% of the installed cyano-ferrate complexes are electrochemically addressable on the timescale of the chronoamperometry measurement. Nevertheless, such a low percentage is consistent with previous observations for NU-1000-supported clusters of cobalt oxide,48 manganese oxide,15 and copper oxide.49 Application of the Cottrell equation50-52 to the chronoamperometry an apparent charge diffusion coefficient of 7 \u00d7 10-14 cm2/s for redox hopping via cyano-ferrate sites. (See Figure S6 and the discussion in Supporting Information for details.)\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, cyano-ferrate complexes can be grafted to the eight-connected, hexa-zirconium(IV)oxy nodes of NU-1000, with an average loading of 1.1 iron per node and with retention of MOF crystallinity and mesoporosity. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments indicate that the cyano-ferrate is sited in the MOF\u2019s small c-pore and that it attaches via loss of cyanide ligands and recruitment of either two or three oxy ligands of the node, i.e. it attaches in two forms, tentatively formulated as Fe(II)(CN)4(-OH)2 4- and Fe(II)(CN)3(-OH)2(-O) 5-, where  refers to bridging between iron and zirconium (and for -O, bridging also between three Zr(IV) ions). The UV-vis reflectance spectrum of FeCN@NU-1000 displays a broad feature that peaks at high energy and is speculatively ascribed to Fe-toZr charge transfer. With electrode-supported thin films (spincoat films), ~2% of the installed cyano ferrate complexes are electrochemically addressable on the tens of seconds time-scale \u2013 reflecting the insulating nature of the nodes. Boosting the percentage of readily accessible (i.e., short-time accessible) electroactive iron centers likely will require devising a means of increasing the loading of cyano-ferrate species and thereby decreasing the separation distance (redox-hopping distance) between iron centers.\nAUTHOR INFORMATION"
