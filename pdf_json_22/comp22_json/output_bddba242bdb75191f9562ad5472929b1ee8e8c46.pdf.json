    "abstractText": "This work deals with the efficient numerical characterization of Pareto stationary fronts for multiobjective optimal control problems with a moderate number of cost functionals and a mildly nonsmooth, elliptic, semilinear PDE-constraint. When \u201cample\u201d controls are considered, strong stationarity conditions that can be used to numerically characterize the Pareto stationary fronts are known for our problem. We show that for finite dimensional controls, a sufficient adjoint-based stationarity system remains obtainable. It turns out that these stationarity conditions remain useful when numerically characterizing the fronts, because they correspond to strong stationarity systems for problems obtained by application of weighted-sum and reference point techniques to the multiobjective problem. We compare the performance of both scalarization techniques using quantifiable measures for the approximation quality. The subproblems of either method are solved with a line-search globalized pseudo-semismooth Newton method that appears to remove the degenerate behavior of the local version of the method employed previously. We apply a matrix-free, iterative approach to deal with the memory and complexity requirements when solving the subproblems of the reference point method and compare several preconditioning approaches.",

Evaluating the quality of Pareto optimal points typically involves interpreting the set of function values of all Pareto optimal points \u2013 the Pareto front. The aim of this paper is the efficient numerical characterization of the Pareto fronts of nonsmooth multiobjective optimal control problems with few objectives and an elliptic PDE-constraint with max-type nonsmoothness using generalized stationarity conditions, and the comparison of the numerical performance of a weighted-sum approach and a reference point method in terms of efficiency and discretization quality. For ease of presentation, we restrict this exposition to the case of two objectives only \u2013 though the scope of this paper can readily be extended to moderately many objective functions using hierarchical approaches, see [3, 4, 15]. Hence, we consider bicriterial problems of the form\nIn (P), the symbols y and u denote the state and control variables in the corresponding state space V and (possibly finite dimensional) control space U , respectively, the ji denote suitably well behaved scalar cost functionals, the i are nonnegative regularization parameters and B \u2236 U \u2192 L2( ) denotes a control-to-right-hand-side mapping. For the detailed assumptions on the problem, we refer to Assumption 1.\nMulticriterial optimization problems with nonsmooth PDE-constraints like (P) arise in various physical applications with conflicting objectives, see, e.g., [13, 16, 19, 21]. The combination of generally only (Hadamard) directionally differentiable Nemytski operators in the constraint and the inherently nonsmooth structure of multiobjective optimization makes sensitivity and stationarity analysis as well as the numerical solution of these problems rather delicate. Their treatment typically requires specialized stationarity concepts and approaches that do not follow standard procedure for G\u00e2teaux differentiable problems. The particular case of the PDEconstraint in (P) is rather well understood in terms of existence and regularity of solutions and differentiability properties of the solution operator and has previously been addressed as a constraint in optimization problems in, e.g., [6, 7]. The specific structure of the PDE even allows for the derivation of strong stationarity systems when the control space is sufficiently rich, which has been considered in both scalar and multiobjective optimization with an arbitrary number of objectives, see [6, 7]. Stationarity conditions of intermediate strength based on the characterization of the subdifferentials of the solution operator to the constraining PDE have been addressed in [6] and the considerations in [7] show that C-stationarity and strong stationarity in fact coincide for ample controls.\nNumerically, the Pareto stationary front of problem (P) has been characterized for two and three cost functionals and L2( ) controls [7] by combining a\n(P) min (y,u) J(y, u) =\n\ufffd J1(y, u)\nJ2(y, u)\n\ufffd = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d j1(y) + 1 2 \u2016u\u20162 U j2(y) + 2 2 \u2016u\u20162 U \u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\ns.t. (y, u) \u2208 V \u00d7 U satisfies \u2212 y + max{0, y} = B(u) in V \ufffd.\n437\n1 3\nEfficient scalarization in nonsmooth PDE-MOOC\nfirst-optimize-then-discretize approach and a pseudo-semismooth Newton (PSN) method, and by using a regularization approach. With multiple objectives, computation times can quickly become large with increased fineness of discretizations of the domain and the Pareto front, making efficient numerics a vital component to these simulations. In [5], the authors discussed a standard offline/online greedy reducedbasis approach for (P) with a single scalar objective function and both low and high dimensional control/parameter space and compared the results to an adaptive way of generating the reduced basis along the solution process of the PSN.\nIn this paper, our goal is the efficient characterization of the Pareto stationary front of the bicriterial problem (P) for both L2( )-controls as well as finite-dimensional controls with specific structure to allow for a combination with the reducedbasis approaches from [5] mentioned above. In the case of the L2( )-controls, where strong stationarity conditions were derived in [7], this is essentially a refinement of the numerical techniques employed in the same paper. For finite dimensional controls, which are typically insufficiently \u201crich\u201d to obtain strong stationarity conditions, however, this requires revisiting the optimality conditions and how they can be used to characterize the Pareto stationary fronts. Following the approaches in [7], we show that, in the case of finite dimensional controls, a sufficient stationarity system can still be obtained. Though a sufficient system for a necessary optimality condition is unfavorable in general, it turns out that the system we obtain is essentially a strong stationarity system for the optimization problems corresponding to the weighted-sum method and the Euclidean reference point method and therefore a somewhat reasonable system to use for characterization of the Pareto stationary fronts. The nonlinear structure in the sets that are involved there, introduced by the nonsmoothness of the PDE, however, does not lend itself to use for characterization of the front directly. Instead, a linearization of the same system will be solved by a line-search stabilized PSN approach and combined with a sign condition that is checked a-posteriori. The line-search essentially eliminates the rare, mesh-dependent non-convergence issue observed for the undamped PSN in [5, 7]. We will compare the efficiency and the approximation quality of the front of the weighted-sum and the reference point approach using quantifiable quality measures.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: We will shortly comment on the assumptions for this paper in Subsect.\u00a01.1. Then, we recall the required notions of Pareto optimality and Pareto stationarity and state the respective first order systems for (non-)ample controls in Sect.\u00a0 2. In the case U = L2( ) , the analytical results are analogous to those in [7] and the strong stationarity results are simply restated, whereas similar conditions in the case U = \u211dp are shown to remain sufficient only. In Sect.\u00a03, we will shortly recall the weighted-sum method and the reference point method, and show that the sufficient system from the multiobjective setting is equivalent to strong stationarity systems for the scalarized systems. We explain how these methods can therefore be used to characterize the Pareto stationary front. The numerical implementation is explained in detail in Sect.\u00a04, where we present a matrix-free preconditioned limited-memory generalized minimal residual (L-GMRES) method for the line-search globalized pseudo-semismooth Newton (gPSN) method that will be used to handle the density of the discretization matrices in the reference point method and the convergence issues arising from the\n438 M.\u00a0Bernreuther et al.\n1 3\nnonsmoothness of the PDE-constraint, respectively. We further present two numerical examples \u2013 one with (FE-discretized) L2( )-controls and one with inherently finite dimensional controls in Sect.\u00a0 5. The interpretation of the numerical results is specifically focused on the effects of different preconditioning strategies for the reference point method. We introduce two quantities to measure the approximation quality of the two methods and use them as a basis for a performance comparison of the two scalarization approaches."

These can cause severe memory and runtime problems when the reference point problem is solved on fine finite element grids with a linear solver. Due to these restrictions, the reference point method\u2019s subproblems will generally take longer to solve than the WSM, also on coarser grids.\nOne thing to keep in mind when applying the PSN method is that there is no guarantee of convergence as seen in the numerical examples in [7]. The method in fact shows failure to converge in practice, with the rate of failed attempts over the subproblems decaying as the grid discretization\u2019s fineness is increased. This suggest some sort of degeneration of the undamped search directions that could be countered with a globalization mechanism.\nAccordingly, the two questions that we will address in the remainder of this section are the following:\n1) Can the non-convergence issue of the PSN method itself be removed? 2) Is it possible to reduce computation times and memory problems of the (linear)\nPSN steps in the reference point method to make it competitive in terms of computation times?"

Since the system is not symmetric positive definite, the CG method is not an alternative and we will use L-GMRES instead. As the performance heavily depends on the condition number of the system matrix (see [18]), which might be very large, especially for very small values of the regularization parameter 2 , we will precondition the method with one of the following preconditioners:\n1. a: The dense terms ( h \u2212 d)( ( h \u2212 d))T and ( 2 u)( 2 u)T are omitted in an approximated system matrix that is used as a preconditioner. 2. aBJ: A block Jacobi preconditioner is applied with the approximation described for the preconditioner a. 3. aBGS: A block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner is applied with the approximation described for the preconditioner a. 4. aILU: An incomplete LU factorization together with the approximation described for the preconditioner a is applied.\nOf course the same iterative, preconditioned approach can be implemented for the WSM, with the only difference being that no approximation \u2013 by ignoring dense terms \u2013 is necessary for the preconditioner. Note that also standard Jacobi, GaussSeidel, block Jacobi and block Gauss-Seidel and incomplete LU factorization preconditioners were tested. But the first two did not give any speed-up and the last four were still significantly less effective than the preconditioners above due to the dense terms still remaining. As expected, it is quite important to use the block structure of the problem as much as possible and to avoid the dense terms.\nRemark 4 As long as 2uT u\u22152 \u2212 z \u2260 0 , the invertibility of the aBJ preconditioner is ensured for the RPM, since the first two block diagonal elements are symmetric positive definite and the last block diagonal element is symmetric and either positive or negative definite (see (19)).

Note that the arguably large value of 1 is necessary for the L-GMRES method to converge without preconditioner, because the (sometimes badly conditioned) problem is numerically difficult to solve. The results for Example 1 are given in Table\u00a02.\nFirst of all, we can see that the computation time decreases for all preconditioning approaches. Also the average number of L-GMRES iterations is very small (between 2 and 3.5) and increases only slightly for smaller step sizes h. The latter observation is in contrast to the performance of the non-preconditioned solving, which starts out with a large number of average L-GMRES iterations that nonetheless significantly increases for smaller step sizes h. Furthermore, we can see that cheaper preconditioners lead to a larger speed-up if the preconditioner is updated more often, i.e. with the preconditioning strategy always update the preconditioner aBJ still gives a significant speed-up of about 35, but all other preconditioners cannot give a speed-up above 9.

This indicates that the problem structure does not change significantly with respect to the current reference point and thus a computationally expensive update of the preconditioner is unnecessary.\nNext, we consider the results for Example 2, which can be found in Table\u00a03. We basically observe the same behavior as previously and again never update and aBJ is the best preconditioning approach. Note that this finite dimensional example is inherently better conditioned and thus combinations of more expensive preconditioners such as a, aBGS and aILU and expensive preconditioning strategies such as update once and always update often lead to larger computation times compared to the performance in the absence of a preconditioner. Furthermore, the preconditioner aILU seems to behave unstably, since the number of average L-GMRES iterations increases significantly for smaller step sizes h. Note that aILU includes some parameters which could be varied and might improve this behavior, but we will not go into details here.\nNext we consider a fixed step size h = 1\u2215100 and investigate the behavior of the different preconditioning approaches for varying 2 . We expect larger condition numbers for smaller values of 2 and therefore problems which are harder to solve numerically. Since the strategies update once and always update and the preconditioner aILU did not prove useful, they are excluded from this considerations. The results can be found in Table\u00a04 for Example 1 and in Table\u00a05 for Example 2.\nIn both examples the average number of L-GMRES iterations increases slightly for smaller values of 2 . This increase is stronger for the first example. If, on the other hand, no preconditioner is used, there is a significant increase for smaller values of 2 . This is especially true for the first example, which starts with an average number of 18.75 iterations for 2 = 1 and ends with an average number of 501.07 iterations for 2 = 10\u22123 .

This means that the problems are relatively well conditioned, but the Pareto fronts are harder to approximate than for smaller values of 2.\nIn order to make the results of the RPM and the WSM qualitatively comparable, we first run the RPM, which yields a number of discretization points on the front. Afterwards we run the WSM with kmax (the number of Pareto points) chosen as the number of discretization points generated by the RPM. At this point we have the same number of discretization points on the respective approximated fronts. However, the WSM tends to cluster the discretization points. In order to obtain comparable approximation quality, we then double the number of points in the WSM until the maximal distance for points on the Pareto front (see (22)) is below the maximal distance for the RPM. Afterwards, the parameter h\u2225 is halved as often as kmax in the WSM was doubled before to compare the evolution of the quality measures max and clust for an increasing size of the approximated Pareto front.\nThe Pareto fronts are shown in Fig.\u00a01.

But the WSM shows a clustering behavior in the lower right corner whilst giving only a poor approximation in the remainder of the Pareto front. This already indicates that some refinement of the weights\u2019 distribution is generally well advised for the WSM. In Fig.\u00a02, the evolution of the quality measures for the WSM and RPM for the procedure described above is shown.\nIn the left figures, we can see that for the WSM the number of points on the Pareto front needs to be doubled seven times in order to reach a maximal distance of points on the Pareto front that is smaller than that of the RPM. Furthermore the approximation quality decreases every time the size of the Pareto front is doubled. This is due to the clustering behavior in the lower right corner. As a result, an unnecessarily large number of points on the Pareto front is needed to reach a desired maximal distance max . On the other hand, with the RPM, the approximation quality\n1 3\neven decreases whilst h\u2225 is halved. This behavior can be seen in the right figures and is even better than expected. Note that the size of the Pareto front is approximately doubled when h\u2225 is halved.\nThe question remains, which method performs better in terms of computational cost. A comparison of the results from the RPM and the first and last result from the WSM in the procedure of doubling the number of discretization points is shown in Table\u00a06.\nThe observation for both examples are similar with respect to sizes of the Pareto fronts and the measures of approximation quality. Also whilst the RPM is slightly slower than the WSM if the same size for the Pareto front is used, it is about 28 times faster than the WSM when an at least equally good approximation quality is desired."

            "text": "If the controls on the right-hand-side of the constraining PDE to (P) are finite dimensional, then conditions that imply primal stationarity can be found. Those conditions can be interpreted as strong stationarity systems of scalarization methods. They are, however, not usable numerically because they contain unknown nonlinearities in the spaces that the conditions are formulated in. Modifying the conditions, we ended\n462 M.\u00a0Bernreuther et al.\n1 3\nup with linear systems as in the case of ample controls. We have shown that both WSM and RPM can be applied to characterize the front of Pareto stationary points for this nonsmooth problem. The reference point method performs significantly better when both approximation quality and computation time are considered, as long as preconditioning is used intelligently in GMRES. In our tests, the preconditioning strategy aBJ without updates performs the best. We also saw that the line-search globalized version of the PSN method leads to better performance and convergence of the method over the basic version with uncontrolled step lengths. A simple reduction of the step size numerically does not appear to guarantee this behavior.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to express great gratitude to the anonymous reviewers, as they caught a major oversight in the analysis of this article\u2019s first version.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.
