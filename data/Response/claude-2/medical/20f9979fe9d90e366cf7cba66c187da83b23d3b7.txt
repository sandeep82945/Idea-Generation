 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection on stroke outcomes and mortality after hospital discharge. The current study only looked at in-hospital mortality, so following patients after discharge could provide insight into longer-term impacts. 

2. Investigate whether COVID-19 leads to more severe strokes at onset. The paper mentions not having initial neurological deficit data, but assessing stroke severity at admission could reveal if COVID-19 influences initial stroke severity.

3. Evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment approaches for COVID-19 patients who experience an ischemic stroke. This could identify optimal management strategies. 

4. Analyze if COVID-19 influences the risk of recurrent strokes or other vascular events after an initial ischemic stroke. This could determine if COVID-19 infection has prolonged vascular effects.

5. Develop prediction models to identify COVID-19 positive ischemic stroke patients most at risk for complications and poor outcomes. These models could guide treatment and monitoring approaches.
