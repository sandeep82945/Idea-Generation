During the past twenty years, the annual total amount of artwork auctioned worldwide has more than quadrupled, while the world GDP has just doubled.1 For both art professionals and researchers, how to price artwork has always been a central concern.

In this model, the sales price of a painting is often explained by multiple factors ranging from painting attributes such as size, material, and signature to sales conditions such as year, salesroom, and sales location.\nThese aforementioned price determinants include the physical features of the artwork as well as the economic conditions for the auction. However, the most important factor for the valuation, what the painting actually depicts, still lacks adequate consideration. We know that paintings\u2019 contents are extremely heterogeneous. To account for the content heterogeneity, researchers usually introduce such categorical variables as signature, dated, topic and style. The first two describe whether the painting is signed or dated by the artist, and the last two classify artworks into distinct subjects (topics) and movements (styles). For example, Renneboog and Spaenjers (2012) introduce eleven subject matters (e.g., abstract, animals, landscape) and thirteen movements (e.g., renaissance, baroque, pop) into the hedonic model. These content dummies undoubtedly improve the traditional art pricing model. Here, we ask whether we can capture deeper information unique to the painting that goes beyond these broad categorizations. After all, ample content variations exist for the both signed and dated, or within the sphere of the same subject and style.\nCurrently, many databases provide large-scale art data that include both auction records and high-quality digital images. Researchers have started applying computer graphics to analyze image data, so as to extract more pricing information from painting content. Recent research in this strand mainly focuses on the effect of the color composition of a painting on its sales price, e.g., Stepanova (2019) and Ma et al. (2022). The idea is that certain colors may trigger specific emotions, consequently influencing the price paid.2 This paper, however, will approach the image analysis of artworks from a different perspective. We try to propose an objective measurement for the quantity of information that a painting delivers and see if it constitutes a significant factor in determining its\n2For example, Bellizzi and Hite (1992) demonstrate the effects of various interior colors in department stores on consumer purchase intentions and buying behavior.\nsales price.\nOur main premise is that the valuation of an artwork is fundamentally influenced by the degree of consensus among professionals. So, any factor under consensus tend to be a potential pricing component, either positively or negatively. We know that a painting\u2019s content is the most important component of the artwork, while it is also the most difficult component for reaching consensus because people have quite subjective preferences. That is why the currrent research normally adopts the objective features of a painting into the hedonic model, since an objective feature can always obtain unambiguous consensus by all people. Such features include a painting\u2019s physical attributes (e.g., size and material), content attributes (e.g., signature, date and color compositions) and economic attributes (e.g., auction house and auction date).\nThis paper focuses on the information extraction from the painting content. We wish to propose a new content variable that improves on the ususal ones. We can see that the signature and dated dummies provide rather coarse information on the painting content, while the color compositions are not quite robust as we show later. We will demonstrate that the information quantity of a painting can uniquely label the painting\u2019s content, and it proves to be an objectve, significant and robust pricing component.\nIn order to measure the information quantity, we need to define \u201cinformation\u201d in the first place. Information is a broad concept, any fact, idea, meaning and so on can all be called information. This paper will only focus on the narrow information concept defined by Shannon (1948), where the information is a means to resolve uncertainty. Therefore, a message that resolves greater uncertainty contains more information. Shannon (1948) also suggested a measurement for the quantity of information, i.e., the entropy.\nEntropy is the fundamental concept in information theory. It is the kind of irreducible complexity below which a signal (message) cannot be further compressed. Mathematically, it is defined as the sum of the probability of each state of the uncertainty from a signal multiplied by the log probability of that same state. It is used to measure the quantity of information in general settings. In the economics and finance literature, entropy also finds its applications. For example, Cabrales et al. (2013, 2017) uses Shannon\nentropy to measure the informativeness of different information structures for investors when making investment decisions. Sims (2006) and Miao et al. (2022) adopt the Shannon entropy to measure uncertainty and information capacity in the study of rational inattention.\nSince an artwork transmits information, we can naturally use entropy to measure the amount of information transmitted. We will rely on an artwork\u2019s digital image because all the information is encoded within the image\u2019s pixels.3 The arrays of pixels constitute lines and shapes, and the combinations of pixel hues form colors. Therefore, the pixels not only carry information about their hue attributes but also their location coordinates in the image. This means that every pixel contains multidimensional information, and each dimension is indispensable to the whole image. For example, if we change some pixels\u2019 locations (or hues) in an image, we will change the picture altogether.\nHow can we measure this kind of multidimensional information given that traditional entropy is often used to quantify one-dimensional information? For this purpose, we introduce singular value decomposition (SVD) entropy.4 SVD is a common tool to extract important features from an image. It is often used to reduce the dimensionality of data. The SVD entropy is the kind of entropy defined over the one-dimensional singular values of the pixel matrix. We will calculate it based on the painting\u2019s color-removed image, which we define as the \u201cbackbone information\u201d of the painting. We then introduce this new measure into the traditional hedonic regression model and test its significance.\nWe obtained more than half a million observations for our empirical analysis. Our benchmark regressions show that the information quantity of an artwork positively affects the sales price at 1% significance level in various specifications. We also run the robustness tests. We control for the topics of artworks in the regression, and the information quantity measurement remains significant. The subsample regression for each topic also provides similar results. Controlling the artwork styles does not change the result either.\nThis positive influence of information quantity on the painting\u2019s sales price is intuitive. 3Note that the pixel is the basic unit of a digital image. Generally, more pixels in a given area of an image correspond to a higher image resolution.\n4The SVD entropy first finds the singular values of the pixel matrix and then calculates the entropy of these singular values. We will explain it in more detail in Section 2.\nThe literature generally finds that a signed or dated painting can fetch a price premium, ceteris paribus. Although coarse, these dummies still provide some kind of additional information, hence resolving some uncertainties. It is generally recognized that an investment asset with more uncertainties tends to have a lower price so that it can yield a risk premium. The same mechanism applies to the information quantity measurement. According to Shannon\u2019s definition, information resolves uncertainty, and more information resolves more uncertainties. Therefore, a painting that delivers a larger amount of information is associated with a lower level of uncertainty, conseqently booting its sales price.\nWe finally compare the SVD entropy to the other content variables. We show that the SVD entropy is more robust than the color compositions, which are sensitive to the testing samples. The SVD entropy is also superior to the signature and dated dummies in terms of the improvement of model fit (measured by adjusted R squared). The SVD entropy is easy to calculate as long as we have access to the artwork\u2019s digital image. Therefore, it is convenient to include this measurement in the usual hedonic regression for a better inference. From a practical point of view, our method may also provide a new perspective for the valuation of artworks.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 lays out the theoretical background. Section 2 describes the information quantity measurement in detail, and Section 3 explains our data and methodology. In Section 4, we provide the empirical results of benchmark regression and robustness tests. Section 5 compares the information quantity measurement to the other content variables and discusses its applicability. Section 6 concludes."

            "text": "Our research analyzes digital images of paintings. The digital image is composed of pixels. Each pixel is a basic information capsule that can be completely describled by the pixel\u2019s R (red), G (green) and B(blue) values, and the pixel\u2019s two-dimensional coordinates in the image plane.5 Researchers try to extract useful information from these painting images in order to better understand the price-formation mechanism of paintings.\nThe literature in this strand mainly concentrates on the relationship between a painting\u2019s color composition and its sales price. For example, Pownall and Graddy (2016) average the R, G and B values of all pixels in a painting image and introduce them into the traditional hedonic model as the new explanatory variables. Stepanova (2019) further integrates this three-dimensional RGB information via a clustering algorithm, and identifies those principal color clusters that may affect a painting\u2019s sales price. Ma et al. (2022) study the effect of colors on artwork pricing via the HSV (hue, saturation, value) color system. HSV describes the three different aspects of color, each of which is a unique aggregation of the underlying RGB values.6 Compared to RGB values, the HSV system appears more intuitive considering the human perception of colors.\nThe literature also raises two main concerns for us. First, previous research reveals certain links between colors and human emotions, e.g., Boyatzis and Varghese (1994) and Hemphill (1996). But how emotions can affect investment decisions seems more complex. There are both rational and behavioral schools in the study of investment decisions. To disentangle the effect of emotions during the art investment decision process poses great challenges. Further research is warranted for this color-emotion-investment transmission mechanism.\nSecond, even though HSV is more intuitive than RGB, it does not reduce the dimensionality of information. How this multidimensional information interacts with each other to influnce art pricing also calls for further studies.7 More importantly, a painting\u2019s colors\n5RGB stands for the strength of the three additive primary colors (red, green and blue) in a pixel on the scale of 0 to 255. For example, RGB (0, 0, 0) means that the proportions of red, green and blue are all 0%, so the pixel is black. RGB (255, 255, 255) indicates that the proportions of the three colors are 100%, and the pixels are white.\n6See Appendix A for detailed formulas. 7Besides HSV, there exist other alternative color models like HSI (hue, saturation, intensity), HSL\nare intrinsically attached to its structural elements, such as line, shape, form, space, etc. This implies that the positional information of color element in the image plane shall also be considered, which, however, is often ignored in the previous research. A further complication also arises from the interaction of color elements with these structural elements when they contribute to the sales price aggregately.\nMa et al. (2022) address some of these issues. For example, to separate the effect of colors from the structural elements of a painting, they adopt a sample that excludes those with figurative work, repeated patterns and less traditional shapes. To test the coloremotion-valuation mechanism, they run lab experiments in different locations, collecting the viewers\u2019 subjective valuations for the images with different color attributes. We think the experiment results might be interpreted with some caution, because the actual sales price is driven by the real buyer\u2019s decision (not the viewer\u2019s). Interestingly, Blum (2021) finds that the tastes of collectors often go in the opposite direction to those of outsiders.\nFrom the above discussion, we can see that predicting a painting\u2019s sales price based on its color component requires certain restrictions. In this paper, we then ask whether other types of information can be extracted from a painting\u2019s image, which is more robust and applicable to more heterogenous painting contents. Drawing on the Shannon information theory, we suggest a concept called information quantity, as a new type of information extraction for paintings. The following discussion tries to answer two essential questions: the first is why the information quantity of a painting can be linked to its sales price, and the second is what direction this link is."

            "text": "The valuation of a painting, as well as other cultural goods, is often considered to lack objective criteria. In contrast, for those traditional assets like stocks and bonds, we can always benchmark against their dividends and interests. In spite of the existence of generally agreed guidelines, the actual assessment of cultural goods often involves subjective judgements. When an artwork receives conflicting views, its valuation must (hue, saturation, lightness), HSB (hue, saturation, brightness), etc. Whether the effect of colors on art pricing is sensitive to the choice of color models also needs further studies.\nrely on some kind of consensus reached by specific groups through social interactions (Lamont (2009), Lewandowska and Smolarska (2020)).\nThen, what kind of attributes of artwork can share the agreement of all people? For a painting, we often point to those objective features, e.g., the painting size and material. They have long been included in the hedonic regression model. So we propose that those features of unambiguous consensus tend to act as significant pricing factors for paintings.\nOf course, the most essential part of a painting is its content. But people find it much harder to reach a consensus when interpreting an artwork\u2019s content, because people are born with differential preferences (Graham et al. (2010), Blum (2021)). We suggest looking for those features in a painting\u2019s content that can be described objectively, hence obtaining a natural consensus. Some of such variables that we know include the painting\u2019s signature, date, color composition, etc. Not surprisingly, various researchers have already introduced them into the art pricing model. Note that the signature and date are dummy variables hence providing very coarse information on content. The color composition is unique to each painting, but it requires additional restrictions to be significant hence not robust (as we argued before and will show below).\nWe propose the amount of information (information quantity) contained in the artwork image as a new content variable. It quantifies how much information a painting delivers to the audience. It uniquely labels each painting\u2019s content and can be measured objectively. So it also belongs to the features of unambiguous consensus, similar to size, material, signature, etc. Naturally, it could also be a potentially significant pricing factor.\nIn this paper, we adopt a narrow definition for information proposed by Claude Shannon, i.e., a message sent by a sender to a receiver. He suggested a quantity measurement for such information, defined as entropy. Shannon asserted that information is used to resolve uncertainty. Therefore, the amount of information a signal transmits can be quantified by the degree of uncertainty that the signal resolves. A higher degree of uncertainty from a signal implies a greater chance of \u2018surprise\u2019 by the receiver, hence resolving it delivers more information. More rigorously, Shannon\u2019s entropy is defined as the sum of the probability of each state of the uncertainty multiplied by the log probability of that same\nstate, that is,\nE = \u2212 n\u2211\ni=1\npi log2 pi,\nwhere pi is the probability of state i among all the n possible states for a signal.\nShannon\u2019s entropy formula is independent of the meaning of the message. In fact, Shannon (1948) suggested, \u201cinformation in the form of a message often contains meaning, but that meaning is not a necessary condition for defining information. It is possible to have information without meaning, whatever that means.\u201d When entropy avoids subjective interpretation completely, it becomes a consensus automatically. We can think of the content entropy for a painting similarly to the number of bytes for a file, which is an objective measurement too.\nWe hypothesize that the Shannon information quantity (measured by entropy) would contribute to the sales price of a painting positively. Although a painting is not the same as a telegram, an analogy from the traditional telegram message may provide us some intuition. A telegram message is usually charged by the number of words used (objective) rather than the meaning or importance of the message (subjective). So statistically, we would expect a larger information quantity corresponds to a higher sales price of the painting, ceteris paribus.\nThe underlying mechanism is similar to how the signature or the dated dummy affects the painting\u2019s price. The literature generally finds that a painting with signature or date information on its image can obtain a higher auction price than those without, ceteris paribus. The reason is that this additional information resolves some kind of uncertainties about the painting, hence the buyer is willing to accept a higher bid for bearing a lower risk. This is a common principle in efficient financial market, which applies to the art market as well. Therefore, a painting with a higher Shannon information quantity transmits more information, hence resolving more uncertainties in one way or another. Consequently, a higher price is expected, ceteris paribus."

            "text": "work\nA digital image with a resolution of m \u00d7 n has m pixels in the horizontal and n pixels in the vertical direction of the image. So the total number of pixels is mn. Then, the information contained in the image must be some kind of aggregation of the information from all mn pixels.8\nOur approach is to first strip off the colors from each pixel. Considering colors will increase the dimensionality of measurement tremendously as we discussed before. When colors are removed, the whole picture becomes black-and-white, and each pixel can be uniquely described by its coordinates (i, j) in the two-dimensional image space and its grayscale value, denoted as grayscaleij. This information of all pixels will eventually be integrated into a one-dimensional measurement of the information quantity for the whole image.\nNote that the grayscale of a pixel is defined as the weighted sum of its primitive RGB values.9 For a black-and-white image, the R,G and B of a given pixel are equivalent, which all equal the pixel\u2019s grayscale value. Moreover, different color models, regardless of HSV, HSL or HSI, become equivalent as well. Therefore, we can call the information in an image after its colors are removed the backbone information of the image. We will work on this backbone information to obtain our measurement of information quantity.\nConsider a digital image withm\u00d7n pixels. Its backbone information can be completely described by a m \u00d7 n matrix with entry grayscaleij, where i \u2208 {1, 2, ...m} and j \u2208 {1, 2, ...n}. We denote this matrix as M . Then how can the information carried by M be measured in an integrated way? We adopt a one-dimensional measurement called SVD entropy to account for the information quantity contained by matrix M .\n8Note that a higher resolution does not necessarily imply a larger information quantity. Shannon information quantity emphasizes the variation of the pixels rather than the absolute number of pixels.\n9The NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) formula for the grayscale is 0.3R + 0.59G + 0.11B.\nThe singular value decomposition (SVD) of M is given by\nM = U\u03a3V T ,\nwhere U and V are orthonormal matrices of size m\u00d7m and n\u00d7n, respectively, and \u03a3 is an m\u00d7n diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries \u03c3i = \u03a3ii for i = 1, . . . , p = min(m,n) are called the singular values of M . The singular values are nonnegative and in decreasing order,\n\u03c31 \u2265 \u03c32 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 \u03c3p \u2265 0.\nThe number of nonzero singular values corresponds to the rank of the matrix M .10\nWith SVD, M can always be decomposed as a weighted sum of separable matrices,\nM = p\u2211 i=1 \u03c3i UiV T i , (1)\nwhere Ui and Vi are the i-th column vectors of U and V , respectively. Here, UiV T i is a separable m \u00d7 n matrix with intensity \u03c3i. SVD is a common tool to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The truncated SVD using the first r terms,\nM\u0303r = r\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c3i UiV T i for r < p,\nis the best approximation of the original matrix M among the matrices with rank r. The truncated SVD is often used to compress images into reduced storage.\nIn Equation (1), the singular value \u03c3i is understood as the \u2018probability\u2018 of a \u2018state\u2019 UiV T i of the matrix M . We can naturally define the entropy out of the singular values \u03c3i. The SVD entropy of M is given by the entropy of the normalized singular values:\nE(M) = \u2212 p\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c3\u0304i log2 \u03c3\u0304i, where \u03c3\u0304i = \u03c3i\u2211p k=1 \u03c3k .\n10Note that the special case of SVD applied to the covariance matrix is well known as principal component analysis (PCA). Since the covariance matrix is symmetric (and positive semidefinite), U = V (m = n), and the singular values are also the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\nThe mathematical property of the SVD entropy is similar to that of the traditional Shannon entropy. The possible minimum value of the SVD entropy is zero, E(M) = 0, when there is only one nonzero singular value.11 For example, a monotone image (e.g., all pixels with the same grayness) has zero SVD entropy. The possible maximum value is E(M) = log p when the singular values are all the same as a nonzero value. The maximum value is achieved when a painting is represented by any orthonormal matrix.\nNote: Figure 1 plots the distributions of the normalized singular values (bottom) of \u2018Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow\u2019 by Piet Mondrian and \u2018Number 5\u2019 by Jackson Pollock. The grayscale SVD entropy values of the two paintings are 3.91 and 7.96. For SVD, the paintings are rescaled to 400\u00d7 400.\nFigure 1 illustrates the singular value distribution and SVD entropy with two paintings: Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow by Piet Mondrian (left) and Number 5 by Jackson Pollock (right). They are both transformed from the original color images into the gray ones. The two paintings show a stark contrast in complexity. Composition with\n11We assume that 0 \u00b7 log 0 = limx\u21920 x log2 x = 0\nRed, Blue and Yellow has an SVD entropy 3.91, as its singular values are concentrated near zero. However, Number 5 has an SVD entropy of 7.96, as its singular values are widely spread out. This SVD entropy value is close to the maximum possible value, log2 400 = 8.64.\nSVD entropy has several properties suitable for computing the information quantity based on digital images. For example, singular values are invariant under both rotation (by 90\u25e6, 180\u25e6, and 270\u25e6) and reflection (on the x and y axes). Additionally, SVD entropy is invariant under the linear scaling of the image matrix (e.g., brightness adjustment). Because the singular values of \u03bbM are \u03bb\u03c3i (\u03bb > 0), the SVD entropy of \u03bbM is the same as that of M .\nSVD entropy is widely applied in feature selection research in computer graphics, e.g., Banerjee and Pal (2014) and Buisine et al. (2021). SVD effectively extracts the important features from a painting, so the entropy based on these important features, i.e., the SVD entropy, will be an appropriate measurement for the painting\u2019s information quantity."

A lot of recent research, such as Filipiak and Filipowska (2016), Ayub et al. (2017), and Powell et al. (2019), has adopted this database. In particular, we collect auction records from the website using the web crawler algorithm modified from that used in Ayub et al. (2017).12\n12https://github.com/orbancedric/CS229-Final-Project\nThe database contains more than one million auction records of artwork in various forms from approximately 300,000 artists. To focus on the artworks with liquidity, we restrict our sample to the auction items that belong to the top 1% artists, who are ranked by the number of auction records (with images) in the database. We then obtain 3,004 artists, whose minimum number of observations is 99. Among all forms of artwork, we only select those related to paintings via their medium keywords as the search criteria.13 Finally, we obtain 529,654 observations with digital images. Although they are only from the top 1% artists, the sample accounts for approximately 38% of the total records in the database. Table 1 reports the distribution of the auction prices. We can see that most of the auction prices (75.44%) fall into the range between 100 and 100,000 US dollars.\nWhen retrieving the digital images, we resize them to uniform 400\u00d7 400 pixels using the bicubic interpolation method rather than using the images in their original resolutions.14 This is because we want to compare the SVD entropies when the physical dimensions of the painting are controlled. Note that the width and height of paintings are to be included as control variables in all of our regression specifications as well.\n13We eliminate those records with the following keywords in their medium labels: bronze, iron, sculpture, terracotta, assemblage, steel, marble, aluminum, brass, ceramic, porcelain, resin, plaster, metal, plastic and stone.\n14See Keys (1981) for the introduction of bicubic interpolation."

We can see that the average auction price is 37,812 USD and that the price dispersion appears to be quite large.

We hold that the SVD entropy is a measure independent of topic and style and that the explanatory power of SVD entropy remains strong even when they are controlled.\nWe first check if our results are robust against the topics, i.e., the subject matters. Renneboog and Spaenjers (2012) classify the topics of paintings into ten large categories: abstract, animals, landscape, nude, people, portrait, religion, self-portrait, still life, and urban. Their classification strategy is implemented by matching the first few words in the title of a given painting with the set of keywords defined for each topic.17 Following the same methodology, we successfully obtain those records that can be labeled by topic, which account for approximately 23% of our original sample. We focus on this sample of 123,221 observations and construct topic dummies based on the above classification criteria.\nThe ten topic dummies correspond to ten subsamples of distinct topics. Table 4 provides the descriptive statistics of the SVD entropy for each of them. We can observe that the standard deviations are typically larger than the differences in the means. It indicates that the SVD entropy adds new information different from that provided by the topic. Among all the topics, we can see the SVD entropy of nude has the smallest mean but the largest standard deviation. In contrast, the entropy of still life has the largest mean while the smallest standard deviation. So we may infer that the paintings that depict still life have much smaller content variations than those depicting nude in terms of how much information is delivered.\nWe introduce the topic dummy Topici as an additional control variable, and run\n17See Appendix C for the detailed keywords table.\nregressions according to Equation (3).\nlog pi = \u03b1Ei + K\u2211 k=1 \u03b2kXki + T\u2211 t=1 \u03b3tDit + \u03b4 Topici + i, (3)\nTable 5 presents the regression results. They are almost the same as the baseline regressions in Table 3. For example, in Specification (5), the painting size also slightly negatively moderates the effect of the information quantity Eg.\nFurthermore, we run the subsample regression for each topic category. Table 6 summarizes the coefficients of Eg, their significance levels, as well as the adjusted R squared from all the subsample regressions according to Specification (2) in Table 3. For every topic, the SVD entropy positively affects the sales price very significantly. When the magnitudes of the coefficients are compared, we observe that the SVD entropy has the largest impact on still life while the smallest impact on nude. This result is consistent with the statistical properties of SVD entropies from these two topic categories reported in Table 4."

By matching the artist name and the painting title from these two databases, we obtain 21,027 observations whose auction prices and styles are both available. Note that this sample is much smaller than the previous sample with topic labels.\nAs WikiArt adopts a much finer style classification than Renneboog and Spaenjers (2012), our sample finally obtains more than eighty distinct styles.19 For brevity, Table 7 only presents the descriptive statistics of the SVD entropies for the top 10 styles ranked by the number of observations in the sample.

            "text": "So far, we demonstrate that Eg, the SVD entropy that measures the amount of backbone information of a painting, can significantly positively affect the sales price of the painting in a robust way. Nowadays, it is very convenient to obtian a high-quality digital image for almost any painting. So, creating some kind of measurements based on the pixel-level information will surely find more and more applications in art pricing research. The most common measurements in literature are color variables. However, we show below that the color attributes of a painting, although being objective measurements too, may not be robust regressors for the sales price.\nThe literature generally finds that the percentage of blue or red in a painting can fetch a price premium based on various testing samples (e.g., the Picasso sample in Stepanova (2019) and the shape/pattern-controlled sample in Ma et al. (2022)). In this paper, we construct similar color measurements, i.e., the percentages of blue and red (denoted as Redpct and Bluepct), and test their effects on the painting\u2019s sales price based on the matched sample with style labels.21 The results in Table 9 show that the percentage of red is not significant while the percentage of blue even has a negative effect on the sales price. Furthermore, neither blue nor red color percentage interacts with Eg. It implies that the color compositions cannot affect price via the Shannon information channel. So, if we can extract the Shannon information from colors, it must be derived from the colors\u2019 attachments to the painting\u2019s structural elements like line, shape, form, etc., which we define as backbone information before. In that case, removing colors from an image may not lose the image\u2019s Shannon information.\nOur testing sample can be considered a random sample as it is obtained from the matching of two different databases. So we can say that compared to the color attributes, the SVD entropy is more robust against the sample selection. Moreover, we will show below that the SVD entropy also improves the model fit more than the other commonly adopted variables that describe a painting\u2019s content.\n21We define the percentage of red as the proportion of pixels with hue values in the range of 0-14 or 165-179, and the percentage of blue as the proportion of pixels with hue values in the range of 105-134.\nThese common content variables in the hedonic regression model include: siganiture dummy, dated dummy, topic dummy and style dummy. For the model fit comparison here, we will not consider the topic and style dummies for two reasons. First, different sources have different classification criteria, so they appear to be subjective relative to the other content variables. Second, they generally contain quite a few categories, which give them a natural advantage in increasing the R squared. So we will only focus on the three objective measurements concerning the content, i.e., the SVD entropy, the signature dummy and the dated dummy.\nWe take two different approaches to compare each variable\u2019s contribution to the adjusted R squared based on the largest sample (529,654 observations) used in the benchmark regression. The first approach is to control all the other variables while adding these three content variables one by one to see which improves the adjusted R squared the most. The results are presented in the upper part of Table 10. The second approach is to run the regression with the full set of variables and then omit these three variables alternatively to see which decreases the adjusted R squared the least. The lower part of Table 10 shows the results. Both approaches indicate that the SVD entropy Eg enhances the model fit more than the signature dummy as well as the dated dummy. Note that the improvement brought by each variable to the model\u2019s R squared appears small. This is because the regression includes more than three thousand regressors, so each single variable\u2019s contribution is diminished.\nIn sum, considering the SVD entropy\u2019s convenient data accessibility, straightforward calculation algorithm, as well as its advantages in variable significance, sample robustness and model fit, we expect its wide application in future research."

We suggest using SVD entropy to measure the Shannon information quantity based on each painting\u2019s digital image. Our empirical tests show that the Shannon information quantity (measured by SVD entropy) of a painting is a significant and robust pricing factor. It is also superior to the other usual content variables, such as the signature dummy and the dated dummy, in terms of the improvement to model fit.\nOur research demonstrates that applying computer graphic techniques to art pricing is valuable. For future studies, we may test the effect of SVD entropy with other available data samples to assess its robustness. Also, we can investigate the information in threedimensional artworks, such as sculptures and porcelains, so as to improve their pricing models."

Then the\nsaturation indicates how close the color is to the spectral color.\nSaturation =  max(R,G,B)\u2212min(R,G,B), max(R,G,B) if max(R,G,B) 6= 0\n0 otherwise"
