GPX1 expression is highly correlated with carcinogenesis and disease progression. The goal of the study was to determine the association between GPX1 expression and tumor therapy, and to identify GPX1 prognostic value in various malignancies.\nMethods\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases were used to detect the levels of GPX1 expression in human tumor tissues and normal tissues. Indeed, correlations between GPX1 and tumor purity, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and DNA mismatch repair genes (MMRs) were explored using the TCGA cohort. Functional and enrichment analyses were performed by the GeneMANIA database and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), respectively. Cox regression models and Kaplan \u2013 Meier curves were used to screen for independent risk factors and estimate brain lower-grade glioma (LGG) survival probability. The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database was used to determine whether GPX1 had a racespeci c effect on overall survival (OS) in LGG. The cross-interaction between GPX1 and chemoradiotherapy on LGG OS was determined by Kaplan \u2013 Meier curves. Logistic regression models of multiplicative interactions were constructed. Furthermore, the relationship between GPX1 and LGG treatment regimens was also explored through the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database.\nResults\nGPX1 was highly expressed in various tumors, GPX1 overexpression was signi cantly correlated with the poor prognosis of LGG. GPX1 was found to be an independent predictive factor for LGG in both univariate and multivariate Cox models. The nomogram showed a high predictive accuracy (C-index: 0.804, 95% CI: 0.74-0.86). In addition, GPX1 was signi cantly associated with TMB, MSI, and MMRs in diverse cancers. GPX1 was involved in IL6/JAK/STAT3, in ammatory response, and apoptosis signaling pathways. Besides, non-radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and low GPX1 expression were important factors affecting the better prognosis of LGG. GPX1 acted as a tumor promoter, which has taken the worst effect on LGG survival, but a multiplicative interaction of GPX1*chemoradiotherapy may improve the poor clinical outcome. GPX1 was negatively correlated with the half inhibition concentration (IC50) of temozolomide (TMZ) (Spearman = -0.44, P = 4.52\u00d710-26).\nConclusion\nIn LGG patients, high GPX1 expression was linked to a shorter OS. The interaction between GPX1 and chemoradiotherapy exhibits a bene cial clinical effect and chemotherapy was recommended for LGG\nPage 3/28\npatients, especially for those with high GPX1 expression. Besides, high GPX1 expression can predict TMZ sensitivity in LGG, providing potential evidence for chemotherapy. On the whole, this study presents a wealth of biological as well as clinical signi cance for the roles of GPX1 in human tumors, particularly in LGG.\nIntroduction Globally, cancer has become a serious public health issue, with rising morbidity and mortality. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), approximately 19.3\u00a0million novel cancer cases and ten million cancer-related deaths occur all around the world in 2020[1]. Malignancy seldom displays clinical symptoms in the early stages of the disease, increasing the burden of the disease in the late stage, leading to poor prognosis in the late stage. Diffuse malignant gliomas are central nervous system (CNS) primary tumors that are aggressive, representing 30% of tumors and 81% of all brain malignancies[2], resulting in over 0.6\u00a0million deaths and 1.5\u00a0million con rmed cases annually in the United States[3]. In 2021, World Health Organization (WHO) classi ed gliomas into brain low-grade gliomas (LGG, I/II) and brain high-grade gliomas (HGG, III/IV) according to the histological features[4]. LGG is caused by the aberrant growth of glial cells that are predominantly composed of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. LGG grows at a slower speed than high-grade tumors and accounts for 10 to 20 percent of all primary brain tumors, and the median survival time is between 4.7 and 9.8 years, but some certain subtypes survived up to 13 years[5, 6]. However, aggressive comprehensive treatments for LGG are currently improving, such as surgery, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and tumor treating elds (TTF), with relatively poor outcomes and prognosis [7]. Therefore, it is still an urgent need to investigate potential and useful biomarkers to improve prognosis and therapy for LGG patients.\nSelenium (Se) is an essential trace element found practically in almost all living creatures on the planet[8]. It is also a powerful nutritional antioxidant that exerts its biological effects by incorporating the presence of selenoproteins in the form of selenocysteine (Sec) into the translation process[9]. In the human body, the selenoproteome currently consists of 25 proteins that engage in the redox catalytic process and regulates numerous pathophysiological changes to prevent cancer progression[8, 9], including glutathione peroxidases (GPXs), iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs), thioredoxin reductases (TXNRDs), methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B1 (MSRB1), and selenophosphate synthetases (SEPHS) [10]. Se supplementation has been shown to lessen the occurrence and severity of carcinogenesis in the liver, esophagus, pancreas, prostate, colon, and mammary glands[11]. In patients with glioblastoma, se therapy reduced tumor severity and relieving disease manifestations[12]. The antioxidant enzyme GPX1, was the rst discovered mammalian selenoprotein in GPXs, which is commonly found in cell mitochondria and cytoplasm, has been linked to tumor spread and transformation in tumor cells[13, 14]. High oxidative stress response rates have been linked to a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer, arteriosclerosis, chronic in ammatory process, and neurodegeneration[15]. GPX1 was discovered to protect cortical neurons from exogenous oxidative stress-inducing chemicals, preventing oxidative insults to the brain[10]. However, alteration or abnormality of GPX1 expression has been linked to the etiology of cancer and neurodegeneration in studies[16]. Anti-cancer drug therapy is the major common treatment\nPage 4/28\nthat induces tumor cell apoptosis so far, but therapeutic modalities that induce tumor cell apoptosis to overcome tumor drug resistance remain a challenge[17\u201319]. Consequently, tumor treatment forms and biomarkers have become a new study focus.\nThe goal of this study was to explore the possible links between GPX1 expression and survival, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), immunological tumor purity, and DNA mismatch repair genes (MMRs) in 33 distinct cancers. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, a prognostic nomogram model, and calibration curves were performed to provide novel insights into the role of GPX1 in diverse malignancies, which may alter the prognosis of distinct tumor types. Finally, cross-interaction of GPX1 with chemotherapy and radiotherapy on LGG overall survival (OS) was investigated. Further multiplicative interaction models and GPX1 sensitivity to chemotherapy were analyzed, pointing to prospective directions for GPX1 and tumor-immunity and tumor-prognosis system. Figure\u00a01 depicts the study ow chart.\nMaterials And Methods 1.1 Data source and processing\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; http://cancergenome.nih.gov) supplied 11,826 tumor samples and 731 adjacent non-tumor samples for 33 cancer types, encompassing over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic statistics. Clinical data such as age, gender, race, illness stage, and pathological stage were collected using the Genomic Data Commons (GDC; https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) website. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx; (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/) database was used to obtain GPX1 data for normal tissue cases. The GPX1 data was standardized by log2 (TPM +1) transformation and presented by the violin plots using the \u201cggplot\u201d package in R (v4.1.2). Normal samples from the TCGA and GTEx databases were merged, and compared to tumor cases for examining GPX1 mRNA expression in 33 different malignancies.\u00a0Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to evaluate the GPX1 expression difference among various tumors, and the signi cance of the difference in gene expression was determined by the Wilcoxon test, whereby P < 0.05 was considered statistically signi cant.\n1.2 GPX1 Expression Pro les in Human Tissues\nThe Human Protein Atlas (HPA; https://www.proteinatlas.org/) is a comprehensive database that contains details on the expression and distribution of over 17,000 different proteins in different organs, cells, and tissues[20]. The \u201cTissue Atlas\u201d shows the distribution of proteins across all tissues and organs, the \u201cPathology Atlas\u201d uses immunohistochemistry (IHC) to display the impact of protein expression on the survival probability of tumor patients, the \u201cCell Atlas\u201d uses immunocytochemistry (ICC) to show the subcellular localization of proteins in single cells, and the Metabolic Atlas database (https://metabolicatlas.org/) exhibits the progression of proteins in human metabolism.\n1.3 Association between GPX1 and Immune Score\nPage 5/28\nThe correlation coe cients for different malignancies were calculated using three methods from the R package \"estimate\" (v4.1.2). Immunological abundance is represented by the immune score, while stromal components are represented by the stromal score. The ESTIMATE technique was used to calculate tumor purity based on the proportion of stromal and immune cells. Scatter plots were used to display the greatest correlation coe cients between GPX1 expression and immune in ltration and immune score, with a |R| > 2 thresholds and a P < 0.05 signi cance level.\n1.4 Association between GPX1 Expression and TMB, MSI\nTumor mutational burden (TMB) is a possible biomarker in immunological checkpoints for tumor therapy and prognosis that measures the total number of mutations per million bases (mut/Mb) in the genomic coding area of tumor cell[21]. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a well-known immunotherapy biomarker that refers to the emergence of a new microsatellite allele occurring when a repeat unit is inserted or deleted, as opposed to malignancies[22]. The clinical importance of the relationship between GPX1 expression and TMB, and MSI was investigated in 33 cancers. The rank-sum test was used to evaluate the difference between the two groups, and P 0.05 was regarded as statistically signi cant.\n1.5 Relationship between GPX1 and DNA Mismatch Repair and Methyltransferases\nIn eukaryotic cells, mismatch repair (MMR) was discovered in homologous recombination and was revealed to be involved in the DNA damage signaling system. During DNA replication and recombination, MMR is predominately in the form of base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion mispairs[23]. MMR de ciency has been linked to resistance to several chemotherapeutic drugs that stimulate tumor development and a high response to immune checkpoint blockade treatment[24]. Then, the expression pro les of ve MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM) are then obtained from the TCGA database to determine the regulative correlation between GPX1 and MMRs.\nIn animals, DNA methylation is a well-studied epigenetic alteration that guarantees appropriate gene expression modulation and the silence of stable genes in normal tissues and cells. Several expressed genes are silenced by DNA methylation in certain cancer types, whereas the inactivation of certain tumorsuppressor genes occurs through hypermethylation within the promoter regions[25]. Relationship between GPX1 and four methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) was analyzed by R. Different beta cut-off values contain hyper-methylation (0.7 - 0.5) or hypo-methylation (0.3 - 0.25).\n1.6 Enrichment Analysis of GPX1-related Genes\u00a0\nThe website GeneMANIA (http://www.genemania.org) was used to build a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to investigate the protein functions of GPX1-related genes[26], including physical interactions, predicted genes, genetic interactions, co-expression, enrichment pathway, co-localization, and shared protein domains.\nGSEA (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/) is an analytical tool for assessing transcriptome data and looking investigating the expression status of genes inside speci ed functional gene sets[27]. The Molecular\nPage 6/28\nSignatures Database (MsigDB; http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb) was applied for systematic analysis of the gene set in Hallmark and terms in KEGG. In GSEA analysis, threshold values are de ned as |Normalized enrichment score (NES)| > 1, P < 0.05, and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.25.\n1.7 Prognostic Value of\u00a0GPX1 in Human Tumors\nThe correlation of GPX1 expression with prognostic status in 33 malignant tumors from the TCGA dataset was investigated using survival prognostic analysis. The four prognostic markers in the KaplanMeier plot are overall survival (OS), disease-speci c survival (DSS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS), which were calculated using \"survminer\" and \"ggforest\" in R.\nUsing Kaplan-Meier survival curves, LGG patients (n = 516) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients (n = 617) were averagely classi ed into high- and low-risk groups based on the median risk score, respectively. The survival probability and prognosis were characterized using hazard ratio (HR) values with a 95% con dence interval (CI) and log-rank P, with a statistically signi cant log-rank P less than 0.05.\n1.8 Construction and Validation of Nomogram for LGG\nUnivariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to explore the prognostic signi cance of GPX1, age, gender, grade, race, radiation, and therapy for patients with LGG by the R package \u201csurvival\u201d, and eventually displayed by forest plots. The R package \"rms\" was used to develop a nomogram for predicting the numerical likelihood of a clinical event based on the integration of many prognostic and determinant variables[28].\nTo evaluate the consistency of projected and actual ndings, the concordance index (C-index) score was utilized. The lower the C-index, the better the model's prediction ability. The accuracy of the nomogram's predictions was then validated using calibration curves. Finally, a survival curve was established to determine the impact of these effective parameters affected patient survival in LGG. The optimal cutoff value of the risk score was calculated using \u201cmaxsta\u201d in R, setting a minimum number of grouped samples larger than 25% and a maximum number of grouped samples of less than 75%.\n1.9 Validation of the Effect of GPX1 on OS of LGG\nThe Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA; http://www.cgga.org.cn/) database collects nearly 2,000 glioma samples from Chinese cohorts in a multi-dimensional functional genomic dataset[29]. To verify whether GPX1 has a race-speci c in uence on LGG patients' survival prognosis and to validate if GPX1 has a race-speci c effect on LGG patients' survival prognosis, three datasets in CGGA of the Chinese population were used for validation, including mRNA_array_301, mRNAseq_325, and mRNAseq_693, data were analyzed by \u201csurvminer\u201d R. LGG patients were separated into two groups based on median score: high GPX1 expression group and low GPX1 expression group. The survival probability and prognosis were described using HR values with 95%CI and the log-rank test.\nPage 7/28\n1.10 Cross-interaction of GPX1 with Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy on OS of LGG\nTo investigate the effect of the cross-interaction between GPX1 expression and clinical treatment regimens on LGG-OS from the TCGA database, 516 LGG patients were grouped into chemotherapy (n = 222) versus non-chemotherapy (n = 47) groups, and radiotherapy (n = 142) versus non-radiotherapy (n = 118) groups, respectively. The four groups were then divided into two groups based on their medium score: high GPX1 expression and low GPX1 expression. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves were used to divide the four groups into two groups: high GPX1 expression and low GPX1 expression. The survival probability and prognosis were described using HR values with 95%CI and the log-rank test.\n1.11 Construction of Multiplicative Interaction Models Related to GPX1\nThe phrase \"multiplicative interaction\" refers to when the combined effect of two or more factors acting on a disease is greater than the sum of their individual effects[30]. The multiplicative interaction between GPX1, radiation, and chemotherapy on LGG was next assessed using logistic regression analysis and forest plots to compensate for potential confounders. 393 independent LGG individuals and corresponding antineoplastic therapies were obtained from the TCGA database. In addition, data with missing values were removed, and models were constructed by \u201cinteractionR\u201d and visualized with \u201cforest\u201d in R.\n1.12 Sensitivity of GPX1 to Chemotherapy\nThe Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/) is the largest publicly accessible pharmacogenomics database, combining genomes data from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) with data on drug activity[31]. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the latest, more well-tolerated, and easier-tomanaged chemotherapy that shows e cacy in both the upfront and recurrent settings\u00a0[5]. Then, TMZ was selected to predict the chemotherapeutic response for 516 LGG samples from the TCGA database. The \"pRRophetic\" program in R was used to analyze the clinical and TMZ data, and the sample's halfmaximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated using ridge regression. All settings were set to default levels, and duplicated gene expression was summed as the mean value. On the basis of the GDSC database, raw data were modi ed using 10-fold cross-validation. Meanwhile, P < 0.05 was regarded statistically signi cant after eliminating the batch effect of original data using \"combat\" and the batch effect of tissue-type using \"allSoldTumours\" in R.\n1.13 Statistical Analysis\nGPX1 expression data were derived from the TCGA and GTEx databases and normalized by log2 transformation. A comparison of normal tissues and tumor tissues was analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test. The R language (version 4.1.2) was used to conduct all statistical analyses, R packages (ggplot, estimate, survminer, ggforest, rms, maxsta, pRRophetic, allSoldTumours, interactionR) were utilized to visualize the results. The log-rank test was used to estimate survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method. The risk\nPage 8/28\nfactors for LGG were estimated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, with P < 0.05 considered signi cant.\nResults 2.1 GPX1 Expression and Distribution in Human Normal Tissues\nThe HPA database was used to assess the mRNA expression of GPX1 in normal tissues and organs, as well as its protein expression. Analysis showed that GPX1 mRNA was highly expressed in more than 50 normal adjacent tissues and organs (P = 0), such as adipose tissue, cerebral cortex, and ovary (Figure 2AD). While GPX1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in the rectum and so on. Nevertheless, IHC showed that GPX1 protein expression was lowly or moderately expressed in the colon, liver, and cerebral cortex (Figure 2E).\n2.2 GPX1 Expression in Human Tumors and Its Metabolic Processes\nThe expression of GPX1 mRNA in normal tissues and malignant tumors was compared using TCGA and GTEx databases. The protein expression pro les of GPX1 in tumors were detected via the pathology atlas of HPA. Compared to normal tissues, GPX1 mRNA expression was overexpressed in 25 tumors, including CESC, GBM, and STAD. In contrast, GPX1 mRNA expression was under-expressed in LUSC (Figure 3A-B). Nevertheless, IHC analysis showed that GPX1 protein was moderately or weekly expressed in many cancers based on cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer (Figure 3C-D). GPX1 was also shown to be involved in 12 processes across three metabolic pathways, including glutathione metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and linoleate metabolism. While the process of metabolism was mainly located in the cytosol and extracellular, the mesh diagram showed a good connection between reactants and metabolites (Figure 4 A-B).\n2.3 Association between GPX1 and Immune Score\nTo investigate the in uence of GPX1 on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) during tumor growth, we used the R package \"Estimate\" to generate an immune score and stromal score. The stromal score of LGG, SARC, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) among the 33 tumors exhibited a strong connection with GPX1 expression. Notably, according to ESTIMATE score, LGG (R = 0.637, P = 0), GBM (R = 0.488, P = 2.39\u00d710-11), and LUSC (R = 0.317, P =5.07\u00d710-13) were the most signi cantly positively correlated with GPX1 expression in immune tumor purity (Figure 4C).\n2.4\u00a0Association between GPX1 Expression and TMB, MSI\nCorrelation between TMB and\u00a0GPX1 expression was statistically explored for each tumor, showing that\u00a0GPX1 expression was positively linked to TMB in seven tumors, such as\u00a0thymoma\u00a0(THYM, R = 0.364, P = 6.77\u00d710-5),\u00a0uterine carcinosarcoma\u00a0(UCS, R = 0.318, P = 0.017), and LGG (R = 0.123, P = 0.005).\u00a0GPX1 expression was negatively linked to four tumors, including\u00a0acute myeloid leukemia\u00a0(LAML, R = -0.314, P =\nPage 9/28\n0.001) and\u00a0lung adenocarcinoma\u00a0(LUAD, R = -0.141, P = 0.001). Analysis showed that GPX1 expression was signi cantly negatively associated with MSI in 11 types of tumors, such as LGG (R = -0.096, P = 0.031),\u00a0rectum adenocarcinoma\u00a0(READ, R = -0.424, P = 5.73\u00d710-8), and LUSC (R = -0.222, P = 6.45\u00d710-7). Notably, these results\u00a0provide potential effective methods for immunotherapeutic targets.\n2.5 Correlation between GPX1 and DNA Mismatch Repair Genes and Methyltransferases\nAlmost all MMRs were positively linked to GPX1 expression in\u00a0adrenocortical carcinoma\u00a0(ACC), negatively correlated with the\u00a0GPX1 expression in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), GBM, LUAD, colon adenocarcinoma\u00a0(COAD), LUSC, READ, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD),\u00a0thyroid carcinoma\u00a0(THCA), and THYM (Figure 5A), suggesting that\u00a0GPX1 modulates tumor cell viability by downregulating DNA MMRs and related genes.\nAnalysis showed a signi cant negative correlation between GPX1 and four methyltransferases in BRCA, GBM, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), PRAD, SARC, and THYM. In contrast, a positive correlation was observed between GPX1 and four methyltransferases in kidney chromophobe (KICH) (Figure 5B), suggesting that GPX1 modulates tumorigenesis and progression by downregulating epigenetic-related factors in 33 various tumors.\u00a0These ndings suggested that GPX1 is important for tumor immunity and immune evasion.\n2.6 Enrichment Analysis of GPX1-related Genes\u00a0\nGeneMANIA online tool was used to identify the potential GPX1 protein mechanism. Analysis showed a strong physical interaction between GPX1 and EXOSC2, TXN, and SELENBP1. Most GPX1-related proteins were implicated in the process of co-expression and shared protein domains. Additional analysis showed that GPX1 was mainly involved in antioxidant activity, oxidoreductase activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism (Figure 5C). In addition, GSEA showed that oxidative phosphorylation, autoimmune thyroid disease, nucleotide sugar metabolism, and TOLL-like receptor signal pathway were identi ed as the most enriched KEGG pathways. Furthermore, the P53 pathway, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, and ROS pathway were identi ed as the higher enriched hallmark signaling pathways (Figure 5D-F). Suggesting that GPX1 was implicated in the regulation of signaling pathways involved in the metabolism and progression of tumors.\n2.7\u00a0Prognostic Value of\u00a0GPX1 in Human Malignant Tumors\nThe correlation between GPX1 and the prognosis of various tumors was investigated by the TCGA cohort. Forest plots showed GPX1 expression was highly correlated with poor OS in LGG, GBM,\u00a0uveal melanoma\u00a0(UVM), and KICH (Figure 6A). Overexpression of GPX1 was linked to poor PFS in LGG, GBM, and KIRC (Figure 6B). Furthermore, According to DSS analysis, elevated GPX1 expression was linked to a poor prognosis in LGG, GBM, KIRC, UVM, and KICH patients (Figure 6C). However, DFS analysis revealed a link between GPX1 expression and poor clinical outcomes in ACC (Figure 6D). These results\nPage 10/28\ndemonstrated that GPX1 overexpression was linked to a poor prognosis in patients with LGG and GBM in terms of OS, PFS, and DSS.\nSurvival analysis was constructed for predicting the survival probability on the OS of LGG and GBM. The high-risk group in LGG was much worse than the low-risk group (HR=2.71, P = 3.4\u00d710-8), while the low-risk group in GBM was associated with an increased survival time (HR= 4, P = 5.2\u00d710-23), revealing that GPX1 was a risk indicator that reduced the survival time and increased the deaths for patients with LGG and GBM (Figure 6E-F).\n2.8 Construction and Validation of Nomogram for LGG\nA substantial link was found between GPX1 and several types of malignancies using survival prognosis analysis, immunological score, and genetic mutation analysis. All of the above-indicated GPX1 was closely correlated with LGG. GPX1, age, grade, and radiation therapy were all found to be associated with LGG OS in a univariate study (Figure 7A). Meanwhile, multivariate Cox regression analysis found GPX1, age, and grade as independent predictive variables for LGG (Figure 7B). The independent predictive risk indicators obtained were used to construct a nomogram for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS for LGG patients. The C-index score of the nomogram was 0.804 (95% CI: 0.74-0.86, P = 1.0\u00d710-20), indicating the predicted model had high predictive accuracy (Figure 7C). For the 1-, 3-, and 5-year LGG OS, calibration curves revealed good consistency between the nomogram's predicted survival outcome and the observed actual survival outcome (Figure 7D). Then, GPX1 was identi ed to be the worst prognostic indicator in LGG according to survival analysis (HR = 5.92, P = 9.0\u00d710-13, Figure 7E).\n2.9 Validation of the Effect of GPX1 on OS of LGG\nThe CGGA database was utilized to evaluate the in uence of GPX1 on the survival prognosis of LGG patients to con rm the nding from the TCGA database that low expression of GPX1 is advantageous to the survival of LGG patients. The results showed that patients with high GPX1 expression had a considerably worse survival prognosis and a signi cantly shorter OS than those with low GPX1 expression in all three datasets, suggesting the effect of GPX1 expression on LGG patients has no signi cant race-speci city (Figure 8A-C).\nThese results showed a signi cant difference that low expression of GPX1 increased the survival time and probability of LGG patients, which was bene cial in improving survival status.\n2.10 Cross-Interaction of GPX1 with Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy on OS of LGG\nLGG patients were divided into radiation and non-radiotherapy groups based on their median score. Analysis showed that the survival probability of the radiotherapy group was much lower than the nonradiotherapy group in LGG patients (HR=2.02, P = 0.01, Figure 8D). Obviously,\u00a0low GPX1 expression still performed a higher survival rate than high GPX1 expression in the radiotherapy group (HR = 2.66, P = 0.01, Figure 8E) and non-radiotherapy group (HR=2.82, P = 0.03, Figure 8F), respectively.\u00a0Subsequently,\nPage 11/28\nLGG patients were divided into chemotherapy group and non-chemotherapy group according to median score. Surprisingly,\u00a0the chemotherapy group obtained more survival time than the non-chemotherapy group (HR=2.05, P = 7.6\u00d710-4, Figure 8G). Overexpression of GPX1 was also linked to worse clinical outcomes in the chemotherapy group (HR=1.77, P = 0.03,\u00a0Figure 8H). In the non-chemotherapy group, there was no statistical difference between high and low GPX1 expression, although the high GPX1 expression group had a trend of shorter OS (P = 0.14,\u00a0Figure 8I).\nThese ndings suggested that greater GPX1 expression was associated with a shorter OS in LGG patients, and chemotherapy was a recommended therapy in clinical practice. While, radiotherapy was not a recommended therapy, especially in patients with overexpression of GPX1.\n2.11 Construction of Multiplicative Interaction Models\nCross-interaction mentioned above clearly suggested a statistical interaction between GPX1, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, which indicated this interaction is of importance in designing more effective prevention measures and in screening for LGG. Therefore, we established the multivariable-adjusted associations for exploring the multiplicative interaction of GPX1, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (Table 1). As shown in Figure 9A, GPX1 expression (OR = 1.46, P = 0.033) has more deeply affected the survival status in patients with LGG than radiotherapy (OR = 0.597, P = 0.028) and chemotherapy (OR = 0.526, P = 0.005), as a tumor promoter. Moreover, results showed that there were positive multiplicative interactions on LGG survival, including GPX1*radiotherapy (OR = 0.948, P = 0.032), GPX1*chemotherapy (OR = 0.933, P = 0.005), GPX1*chemoradiotherapy (OR = 0.881, P = P 0.001), and chemoradiotherapy (OR = 0.313, P 0.001), suggesting multiplicative therapy effect of GPX1*radiotherapy is much worse than GPX1*chemoradiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy.\nThese results suggested that GPX1 has taken the worst effect on LGG survival, but GPX1*chemoradiotherapy may improve the poor clinical outcome.\n2.12 Sensitivity of GPX1 to chemotherapy\nThe GDSC database was then utilized to estimate the pharmacological effect of TMZ on LGG patients with elevated GPX1 expression using the GDSC database. Increased GPX1 expression was shown to be strongly inversely associated with TMZ IC50 in the study (spearman = -0.44, P = 4.52\u00d710-26, Figure 9B), suggesting GPX1 could predict the sensitivity of TMZ in LGG patients.\nDiscussion Selenium plays a key role in the antioxidant defense process in the human body, the effective utilization rate of selenium is strongly correlated with antioxidation activity[32]. Due to a faster metabolic rate and hypoxia-induced mitochondrial malfunction, tumor cells generate some reactive oxygen species (ROS) as compared to normal cells[33]. In a well-balanced process, ROS are continually created in cells and eliminated from them through many complicated synthesis and breakdown mechanisms[34, 35]. Excess\nPage 12/28\noxidative stress, such as that caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS), appears to increase the risk of glioma. An elevated ROS/RNS ratio can cause DNA damage and con ne the activity of cellular enzymes, both of which can affect glioma apoptosis and proliferation[36].\u00a0If an imbalance arises, proteins, DNA, and membrane unsaturated fatty acids may be damaged by oxidation[37]. By scavenging hydrogen peroxide, GPXs are vital components of the antioxidant system (H2O2), organic peroxides, and lipid peroxides[38]. Fortunately,\u00a0GPX1 could exhibit its function by counteracting oxidative damage and preventing oxidative DNA alterations early in the cancer formation process[39].\u00a0Several antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase and catalase, have a regulatory function in decreasing oxidative stress responses by minimizing external oxide assaults[40, 41]. GPX1 was more successful in boosting the electron-catalyzed reduction of hydrogen peroxide or lipid peroxide in lowering intracellular peroxide formation than catalase, mostly via blocking the phosphorylation cascade through suppression of phosphatase inactivation[33, 42]. In a variety of tumor models, GPX1 has been linked to cancer induction and anti-cancer activities[43]. For example, high GPX1 expression is signi cantly linked to poor clinical prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma[44], enhances tumorigenesis in skin cancer[45], and inhibits pancreatic tumor cells proliferation in mice models[46]. Meanwhile, high GPX1 activity was associated with high vascular invasion and a lower survival rate in hepatocellular carcinoma[47]. GPX1 de ciency reduces Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced liver injury by induction of T-cell hyporesponsiveness through chronic ROS exposure, inhibiting the production of in ammation-inducing factors secreted by CD4+ T helper (Th) cells as IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF\u03b1[48]. Moreover, GPX1 is also a regulator in pro-in ammatory signaling pathways and vascular activation endothelial activation[49], and it is a downstream gene in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway that has detrimental impacts on tumor development and malignancy promotion due to genetic variation[40]. GPX1 activity affects the apoptotic signaling pathway, protein kinase phosphorylation, and oxidation-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB in intracellular tissues[50-52]. GPX1 has been linked to the development of cancers of the bladder, lung, breast, head and neck, and colon in recent research[53, 54]. Nonetheless, GPX1 expression from a pan-cancer perspective has not been adequately described. It is of great signi cance to conduct basic biological research about the biological functions of GPX1. Therefore, GPX1 expression pro les in 33 various malignant tumors were comprehensively analyzed in multiple online databases, and their prognostic values, therapeutic signi cance, and drug sensitivity test were explored.\nIn this study, GPX1 mRNA expression was found to be considerably higher in most malignant tumors, including LGG, GBM, and KIRP. Immunohistochemistry revealed that GPX1 was substantially expressed in multiple normal organs and malignancies, including the liver, cerebral cortex, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, based on protein expression levels in diverse tumors. By cutting down GPX1 expression in prostate tumor models, tumor cells could accelerate radiation-induced micronucleus production[55]. GPX1 contributed to three metabolic pathways, respectively, the arachidonic acid pathway, linoleate pathway, and glutathione pathway.\u00a0Glutathione (GSH) expression levels have been linked to glioma redox modulation in recent research[56, 57], such glutathione metabolic pathways could in uence the growth of LGG[58]. Further, GPX1 interacts with a variety of reactants, such as\u00a05(S)-HPETE, GSH, NADPH, H2O2, and others, to produce some metabolic products such as GSSG, H2O, and Hepoxilin-A3.\u00a0Overexpression of\nPage 13/28\nGPX1 reduced direct hydrogen peroxide-mediated vasodilation by modulating hydrogen peroxide in endothelial cells, arachidonic acid modulates vascular tone by generating H2O2 in particular vascular beds, and GPX1 de ciency may cause endothelial dysfunction[59, 60].\u00a0GPX1 can catalyze the H2O2 reduction and GSH oxidation, which are reduced back by GSH reductase via NADPH[61]. Further, GPX1 is associated with the NADP/NADPH redox pair, which is implicated in restoring normal GSH/GSSG ratios. By eliminating H2O2 or other hydroperoxides, induction or overexpression of GPX1 protects cancer cells from apoptosis[7, 47], as well as reduces the release of in ammatory factors[62].\u00a0GPX1 was signi cantly linked to LGG in the stromal score, immune score, and estimate score. GPX1 protects against oxidative DNA mutations to counteract the production of COX/LOX-derived proin ammatory mediators[39], such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which is responsible for the signi cant positive correlation between GPX1 and stromal, immune cell scores in LGG[8]. Blocking Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) on lymphocytes or PD-L1 on tumor cells or in ltrating immune cells is advantageous for activating effector T cells and their anti-tumor action. The activation of the anti-tumor immune response is an effective LGG treatment approach[63]. The analyses of TMB, and MSI, need more accuracy to determine which types of patients would bene t from immunotherapy treatment. TMB levels have been shown in previous research to in uence immunotherapy response rates[64], and MSI is the predictive indicator of immunotherapy for advanced solid tumors[65]. TMB levels in 18 tumors and MSI levels in 11 tumors were signi cantly positively related to GPX1 expression, according to Spearman correlation analysis. Surprisingly, GPX1 expression was favorably related to LGG in TMB, but in MSI, it was adversely correlated with LGG. These data suggest that GPX1 expression is closely linked to increased TMB and reduced MSI, which have a superior therapeutic effect with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in patients with malignancies.\nFollowing that, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves and Cox regression forest plots revealed that increased GPX1 expression was associated with a poor prognosis on LGG and GBM, as measured by OS, PFS, and DSS. According to recent research, GPX1 expression has a substantial predictive value in LGG, with statistical signi cance depending on histological subtypes of astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma, respectively[47]. Meanwhile, the role of GPX1 in the prognosis of LGG was examined further using a nomogram model. GPX1 was shown to be a predictive factor for LGG in a Cox analysis. The nomogram and calibration plots demonstrated that GPX1 correctly predicted LGG-OS, with the high agreement between the nomogram prediction and actual observations in terms of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. The Kaplan\u2013Meier curve con rmed that GPX1 is a new prognostic biomarker for LGG. Glioma affects around ve to ten persons out of every 100,000 people in China, according to the Chinese Health Statistics Yearbook[36]. Furthermore, results from the CGGA database indicated that GPX1 has no race-speci c effect on the LGG-OS, suggesting that low expression of GPX1 increased the survival time and survival probability of LGG, which was bene cial in improving the survival status of LGG.\nAlthough surveillance following surgery is feasible for LGG patients with a good prognosis, the e cacy of adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy on LGG patients' survival has been a source of debate[66]. Antioxidant enzyme overexpression in glioma cells may contribute to their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of radiotherapy and non-\nPage 14/28\nradiotherapy, chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy on the survival time of patients with LGG, followed by the analysis of the survival status of GPX1 in the four groups, suggesting that non-radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and low GPX1 expression were important factors affecting the better prognosis of LGG. Moreover, multiplicative interaction models implied that GPX1 acted as a tumor promoter, which has taken the worst effect on LGG survival, but GPX1*chemoradiotherapy may improve the poor clinical outcome. The result of the sensitivity of GPX1 to chemotherapy showed the close clinical relevance of TMZ for LGG treatment. Then, we speculate that GPX1-inhibiting chemotherapy may be a valuable therapeutic strategy for LGG. These ndings may aid clinical practitioners in identifying individuals who will bene t most from targeting GPX1 and developing bene cial tailored therapy regimens for LGG patients.\nGPX1 has signi cant quantities of mRNA and protein in many malignancies and normal tissues. In LGG patients, high GPX1 expression was linked to a shorter OS. Chemotherapy was recommended for LGG patients, especially for those with high GPX1\u00a0expression. Besides, high GPX1 expression can predict TMZ sensitivity in LGG, providing potential evidence for chemotherapy. On the whole, this study presents a wealth of biological as well as clinical signi cance for the roles of GPX1 in human tumors, particularly in LGG.\nDeclarations Funding Statement\nThis study was supported by Special R&D Program Project of Chinese Academy of Se-enriched Industry (2020FXZX05-01), Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province (2020SF-076), Research Project from Health Commission of Shaanxi Provincial Government (2018A017), Education Department of Shaanxi Provincial Government (19JS015), and Subject Innovation Team of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine (132041933).\nCon ict of interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nEthical Approval and Consent to Participate\nAll data for this study are derived from publicly available databases and does not directly involve human participants.
