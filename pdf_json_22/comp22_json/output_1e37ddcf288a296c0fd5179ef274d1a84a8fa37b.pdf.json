    "abstractText": "Routing security attacks in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) represent a challenging issue that may dramatically decrease the network performances and even cause hazardous damage in both lives and equipment. This study proposes a new approach named Multivariate Statistical Detection Scheme (MVSDS), capable of detecting routing security attacks in VANETs based on statistical techniques, namely the multivariate normality tests (MVN). Our detection approach consists of four main stages: first, we construct the input data by monitoring the network traffic in real time based on multiple metrics such as throughput, dropped packets ratio, and overhead traffic ratio. Secondly, we normalize the collected data by applying three different rescaling techniques, namely the Z-Score Normalization (ZSN), the Min-Max Normalization (MMN), and the Normalization by Decimal Scaling (NDS). The resulting data are modeled by a multivariate dataset sampled at different times used as an input by the detection step. The next step allows separating legitimate behavior from malicious one by continuously verifying the conformity of the dataset to the multivariate normality assumption by applying the Rao\u2013Ali test combined with the Ryan\u2013Joiner test. At the end of this step, the Ryan\u2013Joiner correlation coefficient (R\u2013J) is computed at various time windows. The measurement of this coefficient will allow identifying an attacker\u2019s presence whenever this coefficient falls below a threshold corresponding to the normal critical values. Realistic VANET scenarios are simulated using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and NS-3 (network simulator). Our approach implemented in the Matlab environment offers a real time detection scheme that can identify anomalous behavior relying on multivariate data. The proposed scheme is validated in different scenarios under routing attacks, mainly the black hole attack. As far as we know, our proposed approach unprecedentedly employed multivariate normality tests to attack detection in VANETs. It can further be applied to any VANET routing protocol without making any additional changes in the routing algorithm.",

            "text": "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) are one of the significant facets of a smart city used to intelligently monitor and regulate vehicle traffic by means of various communication types and networks such as Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) [1]. VANETs are a subcategory of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), wherein nodes are intelligent vehicles with sophisticated on-board technology and innovative features such as GPS, sensor equipment, radars, etc. Vehicles in VANETs communicate in a self-organized mode without using any fixed infrastructure support for message dissemination; this means that vehicles act as routing nodes in multi-hop mode [2]. VANETs are deployed for various reasons including minimizing the risk of car accidents, optimizing vehicle flows by reducing travel time, and avoiding traffic congestion situations. VANETs can also provide information and entertainment applications to road users. Given that VANETs are a subset of MANETs, they share all of their characteristics [3]. Nonetheless, VANETs have certain distinctive features.\nInformation 2022, 13, 282. https://doi.org/10.3390/info13060282 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information\nInformation 2022, 13, 282 2 of 19\nThe first and the most problematic feature is the high and predictable mobility. Vehicles travel at high speeds and their motions are predictable as vehicles typically follow a mobility pattern regulated by road topology. Furthermore, VANETs face severe delay constraints, particularly in times of emergency when timely delivery of messages is a critical issue. Last but not least, nodes in VANETs are not limited in terms of power transmission and have high computational abilities [4]. VANETs pose many challenges due to the open and shared wireless channel, the fast movement, and the frequent disconnections of vehicles. In this study, we will mainly focus on a critical research challenge, specifically the routing security attacks [5]. We consider the black hole attack [6] which is among the most devastating attacks in VANETs. Hence, the core interest of this paper is to propose a new approach named Multivariate Statistical Detection Scheme (MVSDS) to detect routing security attacks against the AODV routing protocol by applying multivariate statistical techniques, namely the Multivariate Normality (MVN) tests [7\u20139]. In our detection approach, the first step consists of constructing the input data by monitoring the network traffic over time and measuring multiple performance metrics such as throughput, dropped packets ratio, and overhead traffic ratio. These performance indicators are highly affected when the attacks are launched [10]. The second step consists of rescaling the obtained data by applying three different rescaling techniques, namely the Z-Score Normalization (ZSN), the Min-Max Normalization (MMN), and the Normalization by Decimal Scaling (NDS) [11]. The output is modeled by a multivariate dataset used as an input by the detection scheme. The detection step allows identifying legitimate behavior as opposed to malicious behavior by continuously verifying the conformity of the dataset to the multivariate normality assumption. We combined two methods: the multivariate normality test proposed by Rao and Ali [12] and the Ryan\u2013Joiner univariate normality test [13]. At the end of this step, the Ryan\u2013Joiner correlation coefficient (R\u2013J) is computed at various time windows. The measurement of this coefficient will allow identifying the attacker\u2019s presence whenever this coefficient falls below a threshold representing the normal critical values.\nThe main contributions of the present research work are summarized as follows:\n1. Propose a new approach capable of detecting black hole attack in real time and without performing any updates in the routing algorithm operations. 2. Generate multivariate datasets by monitoring the vehicular traffic and simultaneously measuring multiple network metrics. Further, the impact of the black hole attack on these metrics is assessed. 3. Detect the occurrence of attacks by continuously verifying the conformity of the datasets to the multivariate normality assumption by computing correlation coefficients and comparing them against thresholds representing the normal critical values. 4. Demonstrate the relevance of employing data rescaling techniques in improving the data sensitivity to the normality conformity analysis, by comparing the outcomes of different rescaling techniques: Z-Score Normalization (ZSN), Min-Max Normalization (MMN), and Normalization by Decimal Scaling (NDS). 5. Evaluate the proposed scheme using more realistic scenarios based on a realistic mobility model.\nTo demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, implementation of MVSDS with black hole attack is presented. Two scenarios are simulated: one normal AODV without attacks and a second with AODV under black hole attack. The simulation of these scenarios is conducted by combining two simulators: the road traffic generator SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) [14] and the network simulator NS-3 [15]. SUMO is used to create mobility trace files based on a real map extracted from OpenStreetMap. These trace files are then used as input by the network simulator NS-3. The findings reveal that our approach implemented in the Matlab environment [16] can detect AODV abnormal behavior in a real time by involving multiple network traffic characteristics simultaneously. It can further be applied to any VANET routing protocol without making any additional changes in the routing algorithm. The simulation results are promising since our approach needs fewer computational requirements with a high\nInformation 2022, 13, 282 3 of 19\ncapability to analyze multiple network traffic characteristics simultaneously. As far as we know, our approach may offer an innovative solution for the detection of routing security attacks in VANETs. This manuscript is organized into seven sections: In the next section, we introduce the background information. In Section 3, we present the related works of the previous literature. Section 4 describes the proposed approach, while the implementation details are given in Section 5. Section 6 provides an analysis of the results. Concluding remarks and future research directions are given in Section 7."

AODV supports unicast, multicast, and broadcast communications. AODV is also loop free because it uses the destination sequence numbers, which are time stamps indicating the freshness of a route. The key mechanisms implemented in AODV are path discovery, reverse-path setup, and route maintenance. AODV performs route discovery using two types of messages, namely the Route Request (RREQ) and the Route Reply (RREP). Whenever a source node needs to communicate data to a destination. It broadcasts an RREQ to all its neighboring nodes in an expanding ring lookup procedure until reaching the destination node or an intermediate node with a path to the targeted node. That node delivers unicast response to the source node through the RREP message in the reverse path. When the source node receives the RREP message, it starts the data transmission. In AODV route maintenance mechanism, nodes maintain only active routes. Indeed, nodes periodically exchange HELLO messages with their neighbors in order to identify the link\u2019s state and inform about the freshness of the path. If any link is broken during the data transmission, a Route Error (RERR) message is sent to all other nodes affected by the broken link, including the source node. When the source node receives the RERR message, it launches a new route discovery process."

            "text": "The black hole is one of the severe security attacks that may occur against the AODV routing protocol [6]. It is an active attack wherein a rogue node waits for neighboring nodes to send a route request (RREQ) message. When the malicious node receives an RREQ message, this latter, instead of forwarding discovery packets to neighboring nodes, interrupts the route discovery process by instantly sending a fake route reply message (RREP) with the maximum sequence number. Consequently, the source node presumes that route discovery is accomplished and immediately starts the forwarding of data packets to the malicious node believing that the optimal path is through this malicious node. The malicious node then captures all routing packets and drops them. An example of this attack is illustrated below (Figure 1), where node (Vs) wants to communicate with the destination (Vd). The shortest path is Vs\u2013V1\u2013V2\u2013Vd, the rogue node (Black hole) claims to have the shortest path and it unicasts a fake RREP in the reverse path. Afterward, the suspected node completely drops all the data packets forwarded to it. As a result, the overall network performance degrades, and the process of information dissemination is interrupted.\nInformation 2022, 13, 282 4 of 19\nInformation 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 19\ndestination (Vd).

Multivariate Normality Tests (MVN) Normality tests are mainly employed in statistics to test whether the distribution of an observed dataset follows strictly or approximatively a normal distribution and to calculate the probability that a random variable underlying the dataset is normally distributed [9].

            "text": "Numerous studies in the literature have proposed methods to detect and countermeasure the black hole attack in VANETs. In one paper [19], a secure version of the AODV routing protocol was evolved to detect the black hole attack, relying on improvements of the RREQ and RREP routing packets. Further, cryptography function-based encryption and decryption were included to check the legitimacy of the source and the destination nodes. The reliability of the proposed approach was tested in terms of the following performance metrics: drop packets, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and routing request overhead. The researchers outlined that their proposed algorithm outperformed the original version of AODV. However, the improved version suffers from higher overheads and requires modifications of the AODV routing protocol\u2018s current version. Authors of [20] presented an intelligent scheme for black hole attack detection called IDBA that uses four main parameters: the sequence number, the hop count, the packet delivery ratio, and the end to end delay. First, an algorithm was proposed to pre-calculate the so-called thresholds regarding the future actions of the black hole based on the two first parameters, while a second algorithm was presented to compute thresholds for the two other performance metrics. The detection process floods alarms whenever these parameters are out of the predefined thresholds. The proposed IDBA was compared against AODV under black hole, Intrusion Detection System, and EAODV algorithms and showed its outperformance. A new approach for protecting VANET from black and gray hole attackers was developed in [21] named dual attack detection for black and gray hole attacks (DDBG). The suggested DDBG method employs the connected dominating set (CDS) method and two extra characteristics: the energy and the node\u2019s absence from the blacklist. The CDS technique is an efficacious, distinct, and confined method for recognizing nearly connected dominating sets of nodes within a small range. The selected IDS nodes broadcast a kind of status packet inside a size of the dominant set in order to obtain complete behavioral information from their nodes. Later, IDS nodes utilize the DDBG approach to examine the behavioral data obtained to identify malicious nodes and put them on the blacklist if the activity is suspicious. The authors of [22] suggested a novel IDS to detect black hole attack in mobile ad hoc networks based on a hybrid approach that makes use of both Adaptive Fuzzy Neuro Inference System (ANFIS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The PSO is used to increase the efficiency of ANFIS by changing the membership functions and then reducing the error. The ANFIS predictions allow the attacker\u2019s future behavior to be modeled and detected. A database is extracted from the network by creating a neighbor table, which captures all the neighbors\u2019 activities. Afterward, the input parameters are calculated using this database. The authors used NS-2 simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. Authors of [23] proposed a heuristic strategy for identifying black hole attacks in MANETs. The approach is based on a fake RREQ message format similar to RREP, which is frequently employed to transmit faked packets in the AODV route discovery mechanism. Hence, a black hole is entrapped by replying to the requested fake destination IP address,\nInformation 2022, 13, 282 7 of 19\nwhich never existed in the network. This allowed for the identification of single and cooperative black hole intrusions. In their paper [24], the authors presented a new intrusion detection system (IDS) for mitigating black hole attack. This solution, based on the two algorithms Integrated Cross Interio (ICI) and Preset Time Interval Algorithm (PTIA), enables the security of routing nodes by eliminating malicious activities. One of the most challenging tasks is to reduce routing costs while improving performance by reducing reaction time. Another study [25] proposed an innovative clustering algorithm (CH election algorithm) and an intrusion detection framework based on game theory. By establishing stable vehicular clusters with greater communication among member vehicles, the proposed clustering technique maintains the IDS framework\u2019s stability. After that, strategies for electing the CH and a collection of agent nodes for each cluster are used. In order to conduct the intrusion detection operation in a distributed manner, the proposed IDS architecture employs agent nodes, CHs, and RSUs operating at three distinct levels of the vehicular network. In [26], researchers introduced a new algorithm consisting of three stages for detecting black hole. In the first stage, RSU serves as a certificate authority (CA) which keeps and provides a public and private key as well as certificates for the vehicles. Before launching any communication, vehicles must be approved by the RSU. The source transmits afterward the RREQ along with the correct certificate, nonce encryption, and the destination\u2019s public key. Authors of [27] implemented a modified version of the AODV routing protocol named SVODR to detect and mitigate the black hole attack in VANETs. They introduced a modified structure of both the RREQ and the RREP control packets by incorporating an Encrypted Random Number to the source and destination. A legitimate destination node is tested using the destination vehicle packet sequence number and the function (encryption/decryption) performed by the source or destination vehicle. Researchers tested the efficiency of their solution by conducting a comparison study with IDS in VANET.

Each figure shows how each performance metric varies per unit of time in both cases: the normal case and when the black hole attack is launched. Examining these figures, we notice that the network characteristics are generally stable in the normal case (absence of black hole attacker). The small differences recorded are due to the dynamic environment and the high mobility of vehicles in VANETs. In contrast, these characteristics change significantly when the black hole attack is initiated. Indeed, we observe that the AODV routing protocol performance in terms of throughput degrades under the black hole attack. This degradation shows that most data packets have not been successfully transmitted from source to destination. These outcomes are logical since in the black hole attack, the malicious node acts by sending a fake route reply pretending to have the shortest path to the destination and subsequently drops the entire data packet\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nTH (K\nbp s)\nSimulation time (seconds)\nTH variations Time when the attack is launched\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nD PR\nSimulation time (seconds)\nDPR variations Time when the attack is launched\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\nO TR\nSimulation time (seconds)\nOTR variations Time when the attack is launched\nFigure 5.

In contrast, these characteristics cha ge significantly when the black ole attack is initiated. Indeed, we observe that the AODV routing protocol performance in t rms of throughput degra es under th black hole attack. This degradation shows that most data packets have not b en successfully transmitted from source to destination. These outcomes are logical sinc in the black hole attack, the malicious node acts by sending a fake route reply pretending to have the shortest pat to the desti ation and subsequently drops the entire data packet forwarded to it. Similarly, in Figure 5, it can be seen that the ro ped packet ratio increases severely from the time the attack is launched. Again, these variations are explained by\nInformation 2022, 13, 282 15 of 19\nthe presence of the attacker node that tries to drop all the packets rather than delivering them to their intended destination. The variations in Figure 6 reveal a noticeable increase in the overhead traffic ratio after launching the attack in the sixtieth second compared to the normal situation. This finding can be justified by the fact that the number of successfully transmitted packets is lower than the number of routing control packets generated by the AODV routing protocol under black hole attack. As a result, the values of the overhead traffic ratio, which is defined as the ratio between the total number of control packets generated by the AODV routing protocol during route discovery and route maintenance to the total number of transmitted packets goes up. Conclusively, we can say that black hole attack severely affects the AODV performances and disturb the correct execution of the routing operations. These findings cope with our previous study [10], where it was confirmed that AODV performances are highly influenced by the introduction of routing attacks against AODV routing protocol.

Results of the R\u2013J coefficient calculations in the normal scenario (scenario 1).\nFigure 6 represents the results of applying our approach MVSDS (Multivariate Statistical Detection Scheme) in the normal scenario (the absence of black hole attack). This figure shows the plots of the calculated R\u2013J values for non-rescaled and rescaled data with Min-Max Normalization (MMN), Z-Score Normalization (ZSN), and Normalization by Decimal Scaling (NDS) techniques. The objective is to illustrate the importance of data rescaling techniques for attack detection schemes in VANETs. Thresholds used for attack detection corresponding to the critical values of the Ryan\u2013Joiner method are also plotted. From this figure, it can be seen that the R\u2013J values start with lower values than in the first seconds of the simulation. These values are logical since the AODV routing protocol uses the route discovery mechanism before launching the data transmission. As the simulation advances, it can be seen that the observed R\u2013J values increase and we observe that the overall R\u2013J values of the multivariate data are higher than the critical values at various times of the simulation. This outcome suggests that the R\u2013J values without black hole attack confirm the multivariate normality assumption. Furthermore, we note from the plots that the R\u2013J values computed after applying the data rescaling techniques are higher than those computed on the original data for almost the three data rescaling techniques. These findings stipulate that applying the data rescaling techniques improve the data sensitivity to the multivariate normality assumption. This can be extremely helpful in accurately identifying the malicious activities in our detection scheme. From Figure 6, it is also seen that the Min-Max technique performs better, since all points in its plot exceed the R\u2013J calculated for the original data followed by the Decimal Scaling technique. The calculated R\u2013J values by applying the Z-Score technique show quite inferior values as we progress in the simulation. In conclusion, the key point to note is that our detection scheme performs better when applying the data rescaling techniques, particularly the Min-Max technique. In contrast, when the black hole attack is initiated in the network (scenario 2), the computed values of the R\u2013J coefficient had lower values than the critical values at various times of the simulation.

            "text": "In this part, the purpose is to evaluate the proposed approach and demonstrate its applicability to the AODV routing security attack in VANETs. We consider two different scenarios of the AODV routing protocol (scenarios 1 and 2):\n1. Scenario 1: normal AODV without attacks\nIn this case, the experiments are performed according to the simulation parameters exhibited in Table 2. The total vehicles involved are 100 vehicle nodes comprising 10 random source\u2013destination pairs. These pairs simultaneously generate CBR traffic with fixed size packets of 1024 Bytes. Packets are routed using normal AODV routing protocol. In this way, all nodes are legitimate vehicles and no black hole node has been taken. The total time for the simulation was configured to 100 s.\n2 Scenario 2: AODV with black hole att ck\nIn this simulation scenario, we implement one malicious node that acts as the black hole attacker. The remaining nodes are legitimate vehicles that behave normally and broadcast genuine messages to the other vehicles in the network. The steps described in the previous flowchart (Figure 2) are executed and the R\u2013J coefficient values are computed accordingly. The following figures (Figures 6 and 7) depict the results. These figures show the curves obtained after applying the proposed detection sc eme for both scenarios: scenario 1 and scenario 2.\nInformation 2022, 13, 282 16 of 19Information 202 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 19\nFigure 7. Results of the R-J calculations in the black hole scenario (scenario 2).\nBased on Figure 7, we note that in the beginning of the simulation, the R\u2013J values were approximatively very close to the critical values for the non-rescaled data as well as with the Min-Max and Decimal Scaling techniques. However, as we progressed in the simulation, these values decreased noticeably and all the points fell under the critical values in both cases: with and without applying the data rescaling techniques. These outcomes reveal that the data traffic gathered at different times consisting of three variables, namely the throughput, dropped packets ratio, and overhead traffic ratio, are not from a multivariate normal distribution. This conclusion leads to the rejection of the multivariate normality assumption and subsequently confirms the presence of malicious behavior. From the above figure, it was also observed that applying the three data rescaling techniques resulted in R\u2013J coefficient values higher than those calculated on the original data. We note that from the 15th second of the simulation time, the overall values exceed the R\u2013J values computed on the original data. Additionally, the plots show that the Max-Min technique gave better results in terms of sensitivity to the normal distribution followed by the DSN technique, since all the points in their plots are beyond those of the non-rescaled data. In contrast, it was observed on the ZSN curve that not all the points exceeded those of the non-rescaled data. In conclusion, we argue that applying data rescaling techniques can be considered an essential prerequisite for many attack detection tasks but it is often ignored. Further, the question of which technique is more effective still remains. In our study, it is outlined that the Max-Min technique gives better results in comparison with the non-rescaled data and the two remaining techniques. An important conclusion that can be made is that our approach can detect abnormal activities in a simple manner with no updates to the routing protocol operations. Further, all statistical measurements are bounded in time, i.e., correspond to each particular time window, which gives meaningful results when monitoring the network traffic in real time.\n7.

Black hole attack is one of the most serious attacks that affect the data availability in VANETs. In this paper, we proposed a new approach capable of detecting black hole attack in real time and without performing any updates in the routing algorithm. The findings reveal that the present study may provide an unprecedented approach that uses the multivariate normality tests to detect routing security attacks in VANETs. We tested our detection scheme in a more realistic environment using a realistic traffic model. The real time monitoring of the network traffic is a big advantage of our approach since time is a critical factor in detecting incidents in the VANETs. Further, our approach relies on the multivariate concept, which is very useful in the context of our study. VANETs are highly dynamic, and their behavior must be characterized by more than one variable rather than an individual one. In that regard, our approach has the ability to distinguish legitimate behavior from malicious behavior based on multiple network characteristics simultaneously. We involved three main important network metrics that had not been previously combined for black hole detection, namely the throughput, the dropped packets ratio, and the overhead traffic ratio. It is also worth noting that our research demonstrated the relevance of employing data rescaling techniques (ZSN, MMN, and NDS) in improving the data sensitivity to the normality conformity analysis. Further in-depth details regarding these techniques can be tried in the future to get more insights into the differences between these methods and others from the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that combines rescaling techniques with multivariate data traffic for routing security attack detection. As a next step, additional experiments should be undertaken to provide further evaluation of the proposed scheme, including testing other routing security attacks. The proposed detection scheme can be enhanced by integrating other performance metrics and implementing a reaction scheme to countermeasure the routing attacks.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.A. and S.E.H.; methodology, S.A. and M.-A.E.H.; validation, M.H.; formal analysis, S.A., M.H. and S.E.H.; investigation, S.A. and S.E.H.; resources, S.A. and S.E.H.; data curation, S.A. and S.E.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.A., M.H. and S.E.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.A., M.H. and S.E.H.; visualization, S.A., M.-A.E.H. and S.E.H.; supervision, M.H.; project administration, M.H. and S.E.H.
