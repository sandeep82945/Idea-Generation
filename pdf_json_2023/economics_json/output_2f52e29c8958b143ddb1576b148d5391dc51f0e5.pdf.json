In fact, this last feature makes SP laws particularly appealing for financial applications since stock returns and other financial assets often come in the form of sums of a large numbers of independent terms. Moreover the empirical density of such assets is leptokurtic and in many cases\nB Simos G. Meintanis simosmei@econ.uoa.gr\n1 Department of Economics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece\n2 Pure and Applied Analytics, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa\n3 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, American University, Washington DC, USA\n4 Centre for Business Mathematics and Informatics, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa\nskewed, thus making the family of SP laws particularly suited for related applications; see for instance the celebrated stability hypothesis that goes back at least toMandelbrot (1963) and Fama (1965).\nThe above findings prompted further research on the stochastic properties and inference of SP laws and on their application potential. The reader is referred to Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994), Adler et al. (1998), Uchaikin and Zolotarev (1998), Rachev andMittnik (2000) and Nolan (2020) for an overview on the stochastic theory, statistical inference and applications of SP laws.\nIn the aforementioned works, statistical inference and applications are mostly restricted to univariate SP laws. The respective topics for SP random vectors are much less explored. In this connection, certain distributional aspects of SP random vectors are discussed in Press (1972b), while Press (1972a) defines moment-type estimators of the parameters of a multivariate SP distribution utilizing the characteristic function (CF). Maximum-likelihood-based estimation is discussed by Ogata (2013), and Nolan (2013), Bayesian methods in Tsionas (2016), Lombardi and Veredas (2009) use indirect estimation methods, whereas Koutrouvelis (1980), Nolan (2013) and Sathe and Upadhye (2020) consider CF-regression methods. As far as testing is concerned, the only available formal method seems to be the CF-based goodness-of-fit test of Meintanis et al. (2015).\nIn this article we propose CF-based goodness-of-fit procedures for SP random vectors in the elliptically symmetric case. Moreover we also consider the asymmetric case for which to the best of our knowledge goodness-of-fit have not been considered before. The remainder of the article unfolds as follows. In Sect. 2we introduce a general goodness-of-fit test for elliptically symmetric SP laws. In Sect. 3 we particularize this test in terms of computation. Section4 addresses the problem of estimation of the SP parameters and the study of asymptotics of the proposed test, while in Sect. 5 we extend the test to a multivariate GARCHmodel with SP innovations. The results of an extensive simulation study illustrating the finite-sample properties of the method are presented in Sect. 6. In Sect. 7 the case of asymmetric SP law is considered,with known as well as unknown characteristic exponent, by means of a different testing procedure that avoids integration over a complicated CF and computation of the corresponding density. The impact of high dimension on the test statistic is also discussed in this section. Applications are given in Sect. 8, and we conclude in Sect. 9 with a discussion. Some technical material is deferred to an online supplement along with additional Monte Carlo results."

Here we consider goodness-of-fit tests for the elliptically symmetric SP law. In this connection we note that SP random vectors are parameterized by the triplet (\u03b1, \u03b4,Q), where \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2] denotes the characteristic exponent, and \u03b4 \u2208 Rp andQ \u2208 Mp, are location vector and dispersion matrix, respectively, withMp being the set of all symmetric positive definite (p\u00d7 p) matrices. On the basis of i.i.d. copies\n(X j , j = 1, . . . , n) of X we wish to test the null hypothesis\nH0 : X \u223c S\u03b1(\u03b4, Q), for some (\u03b4,Q) \u2208 Rp \u00d7 Mp, (1)\nwhere we write X \u223c S\u03b1(\u03b4, Q) to denote that X follows a SP law with the indicated parameters. For subsequent use we mention that if X \u223c S\u03b1(\u03b4, Q), then it admits the stochastic representation\nX = \u03b4 + A1/2N, (2)\nwhere A is a totally skewed to the right SP random variable with characteristic exponent \u03b1/2 (\u03b1 < 2) and N is a zero-mean Gaussian vector with covariance matrix Q, independent of A; see Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994, \u00a72.5).\nOur test will make use of the fact that if X \u223c S\u03b1(\u03b4, Q), then the CF of X is given by \u03d5\u03b1(t; \u03b4,Q) = ei t \u03b4\u2212(t Qt)\u03b1/2 . The cases \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b1 = 1, respectively, correspond to the most prominent members of the SP family, i.e. the Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, while \u03c6\u03b1(t) = exp(\u2212\u2016t\u2016\u03b1), will denote the CF of a spherical SP law, i.e. an SP law with location \u03b4 = 0 and dispersion matrix Q set equal to the identity matrix.\nAs it is already implicit in (1) the parameters (\u03b4,Q) are considered unknown, and hence they will be replaced by estimators (\u0302\u03b4n, \u0302Qn) and the test procedure will be applied on the standardized data\nY j = \u0302Q\u22121/2n (X j \u2212\u0302\u03b4n), j = 1, . . . , n.

In this connection and despite the fact that, as already emphasized, it is computationally convenient to use a weight function that is proportional to the density of a spherical Kotz-type distribution, our limit results apply under a general weight function satisfying certain assumptions and, under given regularity conditions, with arbitrary estimators of the distributional parameters.\nSpecifically, we assume that the weight function satisfies w(t) > 0 (apart from a set of measure zero), w(t) = w(\u2212t) and \u222b\nRp w(t)dt < \u221e.\nWe also suppose that the estimators figuring in the standardization defined by (3) admit the Bahadur-type asymptotic representations\n\u221a n ( \u0302\u03b4n \u2212 \u03b40 ) = 1\u221a\nn\nn \u2211 j=1 \u03b4(X j ) + oP(1)\nand\n\u221a n ( \u0302Qn \u2212 Q0 ) = 1\u221a\nn\nn \u2211 j=1 Q(X j ) + oP(1),\nwhere (\u03b40,Q0) denote true values, with X1 \u223c S\u03b10(\u03b40,Q0) and ( \u03b4(X1), Q(X1) ) satisfying E ( \u03b4, Q ) = (0, 0) and E \u2225\u2225 \u03b4 + Q \u2225 \u2225 2 < \u221e.\nThen we may write from (4)\nTn,w = \u222b\nRp 2n(t)w(t)dt, n(t) = 1\u221a n\nn \u2211\nj=1\n( cos t Y j + sin t Y j \u2212 \u03c6\u03b10(t) ) .\nIt also follows that \u2016 n \u2212 n,0\u20162 P\u2212\u2192 0, where the approximating process n,0(\u00b7) admits the i.i.d. representation\nn,0(t) = 1\u221a n\nn \u2211 j=1 L \u03b4, Q(X j ),\nupon which the central limit theorem applies, and which together with a subsequent application of the continuous mapping theorem entails\nTn,w D\u2212\u2192 \u222b\nRp 20(t)w(t)dt := Tw,\nwhere 0(\u00b7) is a zero-mean Gaussian process with covariance kernel, say, K (s, t). In turn the law of Tw is that of \u2211\u221e j=1 \u03bb jN 2j , where (N j , j \u2265 1) are i.i.d. standard normal random variables. The covariance kernel K (\u00b7, \u00b7) of the limit process 0(\u00b7) enters the distribution of Tw via the eigenvalues \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 and corresponding eigenfunctions f1, f2, . . ., through the integral equation\n\u03bb f (s) = \u222b\nRp K (t, s) f (t)w(t)dt.\nIn this connection the maximum likelihood estimators defined by (12) satisfy certain equivariance/invariance properties (refer to Section S2 of the online supplement), and as a consequence the resulting test statistic is affine invariant. In this case we may set (\u03b40,Q0) equal to the zero vector and identity matrix, respectively, thus rendering the\nlimit null distribution free of true parameter values; see Ebner and Henze (2020) and Meintanis et al. (2015).\nMoreover the standing assumptions imply the strong consistency of the new test under fixed alternatives.\nProposition 4.1 Suppose that under the given lawof X the estimators of the parameters \u03b4 and Q satisfy, (\u0302\u03b4n,\u0302Qn) \u2192 (\u03b4X ,QX ) \u2208 Rp \u00d7 Mp, a.s. as n \u2192 \u221e.

Proof Recall from (4) that\nTn,w n = \u222b Rp |\u03c6n(t) \u2212 \u03c6\u03b10(t)|2w(t)dt. (14)\nNow the strong uniform consistency of the empirical CF in bounded intervals (see Cs\u00f6rgo\u030b,1981) entails\n\u03d5n(t) \u2192 e\u2212i t Q \u22121/2 X \u03b4X\u03d5 ( Q\u22121/2X t ) ,\na.s. as n \u2192 \u221e. Consequently, since |\u03c6n(t) \u2212 \u03c6\u03b10(t)|2 \u2264 4, an application of Lebesgue\u2019s theorem of dominated convergence on (14) yields (13).\nSince w > 0, Tw is positive unless\n\u03d5 ( Q\u22121/2X t ) = eit Q\u22121/2X \u03b4X\u03c6\u03b10(t),\nidentically in t , which is equivalent to \u03d5(t) = \u03d5\u03b10(t; \u03b4X ,QX ), t \u2208 Rp, i.e. Tw > 0 unless the CF of X coincides with the CF of a SP law with \u03b1 = \u03b10 and (\u03b4,Q) = (\u03b4X ,QX ), and thus by the uniqueness of CFs, the test which rejects the null hypothesisH0 in (1) for large values of Tn,w is consistent against each fixed alternative distribution.\nThe above limit results have been developed in a series of papers, both in the current setting aswell as in related settings, andwith varying conditions on theweight function and the family of distributions under test; see for instance Henze and Wagner (1997), Gupta et al. (2004), Meintanis et al. (2015), Hadjicosta and Richards (2020a), and Ebner andHenze (2020). In this regard, the solution of the above integral equation, and thus the approximation of the limit null distribution of Tn,w, is extremely complicated, and in fact constitutes a research problem in itself. This line of research has been followed by a few authors. We refer to Matsui and Takemura (2008), Hadjicosta and Richards (2020b),Meintanis et al. (2023) and Ebner andHenze (2023). In theseworks, the infinite sum distribution of Tw is approximated by a corresponding finite sum employing numerically computed eigenvalues and then large-sample critical points for\nTn,w are found by Monte Carlo. It should be noted that such approximation is specific in several problem-parameters: the distribution under test, the type of estimators of the distributional parameters, and the weight function employed, and thus have to be performed on a case-to-case basis. A different more heuristic approach is momentmatching between the first few moments of Tw (computed numerically) and a known distribution, like the gamma distribution or one from a Pearson family of distributions; see Henze (1990, 1997) and Pfister et al. (2018), while yet another, Satterthwaite-type, approximation is studied by Lindsay et al. (2008).\nThe validity and usefulness of the above approximation methods notwithstanding, we hereby favorMonte Carlo simulation and bootstrap resampling for the computation of critical points and for test implementation, not only because these are large-sample approximations performed mostly in the univariate setting and thus inappropriate for small sample size n and/or dimension p > 1, but more importantly because, in the case of GARCH-type observations considered in the next section, the finite-sample counterpart of this distributionmay even involve true parameter values; see for instance Henze et al. (2019)."

Corresponding results for the test in (8) that employs the Kotz-type weight function are included in Tables S8 and S9 of the online supplement.\nFor comparison, we include results obtained when using the test of Meintanis et al. (2015) using the Gaussian weight function exp(\u2212\u2016t\u20162). The test, denoted by Ma in the tables, depends on a tuning parameter denoted by a for which we consider the choices a = 4, 6, 10 and a = 15. As pointed out by the authors, the number of operations required to compute their test statistic is in the order of n2a (for integervalued a) and becomes time-consuming for larger values of n and a. We therefore use the Monte Carlo approach suggested by the authors to approximate the value of the test statistic (using 1000 replications for each approximation); see p. 180 ofMeintanis et al. (2015).When testing formultivariate normality (i.e.H0 with\u03b1 = 2), we consider the test of Henze et al. (2019), denoted by HJM in the tables, with weight function exp(\u22121.5\u2016t\u20162), which yielded good results in the original paper.\nThe rejection percentages of the tests are shown in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4. All simulations results are based on 1000 independent Monte Carlo iterations and a significance level of 10% is used throughout.\nWe first consider the case where we test H0 with \u03b1 = 2, i.e. when testing for departures from multivariate normality. Table 1 shows that, when heavier-tailed symmetric Paretian alternatives are considered, the newly proposed tests based on Tr are more powerful than the existing tests Ma of Meintanis et al. (2015), and have power slightly lower but comparable to the test HJM of Henze et al. (2019). In light of the above-mentioned computational complexity of the existing tests, this gain in power makes the new tests attractive for implementation in practice. Moreover, the favorable power is visible for all the considered choices of the tuning parameter r , the choice of which, as opposed to a in Ma , has no significant impact on computational complexity. Finally, as is expected, the power of the new tests increase as the sample size is\nincreased. Similar conclusions can also be made in the case of elliptically symmetric t alternatives (see Table S2 of the online supplement).\nConsidering skew normal alternatives, even more favorable behavior can be observed in the results shown in Table 2. Notice that the tests Ma and HJM seem to have very low power against skew normal alternatives, which is not the case with the newly proposed tests.\nWe now shift our attention to the case of testing H0 with \u03b1 = 1.8. Table 3 shows that, compared to the existing tests, the new tests are quite powerful against heaviertailed alternatives, i.e. alternativeswith stability index less than 1.8.Despite the evident dependence of the performance of the new tests on the tuning parameter r , we note that the power is very competitive to the existing tests in most cases, and significantly outperforms the existing tests for most choices of r . For lighter-tailed alternative distributions, the new tests exhibit some under-rejection for certain choices of r . Nevertheless, the problem seems to disappear as the sample size is increased.\nAnother advantageous feature of tests based on Tr is that the high power is also visible in the higher-dimensional setting where p = 6. In fact, in this case the power of the tests seem to increase as the dimension is increased from p = 4 to p = 6. In contrast, the testsMa exhibit a clear decrease in power as the dimension p is increased.\nWe finally consider testing H0 with \u03b1 = 1, i.e. when testing for departures from multivariate Cauchy. Overall, in agreement with previous observations, Table 4 shows that the new tests seem to be competitive in terms of power, with the existing tests having some advantage when the true data-generating distribution has a stability index greater than 1. However, this advantage in power disappears when considering the higher-dimensional case p = 6. Similar behavior can be seen in the case of t and skew Cauchy alternatives (see Tables S6 and S7 in the supplement)."

(2013) which involves drawing only one bootstrap sample for each Monte Carlo iteration.\nTable 5 (power against symmetric SP laws) exhibits similar favorable power properties of the newly proposed test as was observed in the i.i.d. case. Notice that the tests\nall have empirical size close to the nominal level of 10% when using critical values obtained by means of the bootstrap scheme given above. Also see Tables S13 and S14 of the online supplement.\nTable S12 (power against skew normal alternatives) shows that the new tests are especially competitive in terms of power when the true innovation distribution is not elliptically symmetric.

Accordingly we wish to test the null hypothesis\n\u02dcH0 : X \u223c \u02dcS\u03b1(\u03b4, ), for some \u03b4 \u2208 Rp and some spectral measure on S p,\nwhere we write X \u223c \u02dcS\u03b1(\u03b4, ), when X follows a skew SP law with the indicated parameters.

(2001). In testing the null hypothesis \u02dcH0, we consider an entirely different idea for the test statistic first put forward by Chen et al. (2022). Specifically, we consider a test statistic formulated as a two-sample test between the original data Xn = (X j , j = 1, . . . , n) and artificial data X0n = (X0 j , j = 1, . . . , n) generated under the null hypothesis \u02dcH0. More precisely, we propose the test criterion\n\u02dcTn,w := \u02dcTn,w(Xn;X0n) = n \u222b\nt\u2208Rp |\u03d5n(t) \u2212 \u03d50n(t)|2 w(t)dt, (19)\nwhere \u03d5n(t) = n\u22121\u2211nj=1 ei t X j is the empirical CF of the data at hand, while \u03d50n(t) = n\u22121\u2211nj=1 ei t X0 j is the empirical CF computed from the artificial data set X0n generated under the null hypothesis \u02dcH0 with and \u03b4 estimated from the original observations Xn .\nBy straightforward computations, we obtain\n\u02dcTn,w(Xn;X0n) = 1 n\nn \u2211\nj,k=1\n(\nIw ( X j \u2212 Xk )+ Iw ( X0 j \u2212 X0k )\u2212 2Iw ( X j \u2212 X0k )\n)\n,\n(20) where Iw(x) = \u222b\nRp cos(t x)w(t)dt , as defined in (6). Clearly then the numerical\napproaches of Sect. 3 are no longer required and the simplicity of this test lies in the fact that in (20) only the computation of Iw(\u00b7) is needed. Specifically the need for tailor-made weight functions such as those employed in Sect. 3 is circumvented. Furthermore we no longer need to compute the density of the underlying SP law as in (11). In this connection, suppose that theweight functionw(x) figuring in Iw(x) above is chosen as the density of any spherical distribution in Rp. Then the integral Iw(x) gives the CF corresponding to this spherical distribution at the point x. Furthermore it is well known that this CF may be written as (\u2016x\u20162), where (\u00b7) is called the \u201ckernel\u201d of the specific family of spherical distributions. Thus the test statistic figuring\nin (20) may be written as\n\u02dcTn, (Xn;X0n) = 1 n\nn \u2211\nj,k=1\n( ( \u2016X j \u2212 Xk\u20162 )\n+ ( \u2016X0 j \u2212 X0k\u20162 ) \u2212 2 ( \u2016X j \u2212 X0k\u20162 ) ) , (21)\nwhere the kernel (\u00b7) can be chosen by the practitioner so that the resulting expression in (21) is as simple as possible. In this connection, as already clear from the preceding paragraphs, a simple kernel is the kernel of the spherical SP family of distributions with (\u03be) = e\u2212r\u03be\u03b1/2 , r > 0, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2].\nImplementation of the test however relies on estimation of the spectral measure (\u00b7) appearing in (18). Motivated by a result of Byczkowski et al. (1993, Theorem 1), we assume that (\u00b7) can be approximated by the discrete spectral measure \u02dc (\u00b7) = \u2211K\nk=1 \u03b3kIsk (\u00b7),with weights \u03b3k corresponding to mass points sk \u2208 S p, k = 1, . . . , K , and Isk (\u00b7) being the indicator index. So in order to apply the test, we use the stochastic representation of X0 \u223c \u02dcS\u03b10(\u03b4,\u02dc ) as\nX0 = { \u03b4 +\u2211Kk=1 \u03b3 1/\u03b10k Ak sk if \u03b10 = 1, \u03b4 +\u2211Kk=1 \u03b3k ( Ak + 2\u03c0 log(\u03b3k) ) sk if \u03b10 = 1, (22)\nwhere (Ak, k = 1, . . . , K ) are i.i.d. (univariate) SP variates following a totally skewed to the right SP law with \u03b1 = \u03b10. In turn this representation is used in order to generate observations (X0 j , j = 1, . . . , n) under the null hypothesis \u02dcH0 with \u03b4 and (\u03b3k, k = 1, . . . , K ) replaced by appropriate estimates\u0302\u03b4 and (\u03b3\u0302k, k = 1, . . . , K ), respectively. The estimates\u0302\u03b4 and (\u03b3\u0302k, k = 1, . . . , K ) are obtained as shown in Nolan et al. (2001) and outlined in Section S5 of the online supplement."

Generate a bootstrap sample X \u2217n from the SP law \u02dcS\u03b10(\u0302\u03b4,\u0302 ). 2. Calculate bootstrap estimates\u0302\u03b4 \u2217 and\u0302 \u2217 from X \u2217n and generate m random samples\n(X \u2217r0,n , r = 1, . . . ,m), from the SP law \u02dcS\u03b10(\u0302\u03b4\u2217,\u0302 \u2217). 3.

The null hypothesis is rejected at significance level \u03be whenever the statistic \u02dcT (m) in (24) exceeds the (1 \u2212 \u03be )-level empirical quantile of the sequence of bootstrap realizations {\u02dcT \u2217(m) (b)}Bb=1.\nTable 6 shows the empirical rejection percentages of tests based on\u02dcT with (\u03be) = e\u2212r\u03be\u03b10/2 , where \u03b10 denotes the hypothesized stability index in \u02dcH0. We write \u02dcTr , r > 0, for this test. In the case of unknown \u03b1 in Table 7 we use the same weight function with \u03b10 = 2.\nThe left-hand side of Table 6 shows the rejection percentages when observations are sampled from an asymmetric SP distribution, whereas the right-hand side shows the results when observations are sampled from a symmetric SP distribution. In all cases, the proposed procedure seems to respect the nominal size of the test, although it seems to be somewhat conservative especially for smaller sample sizes. Nevertheless,\n(\u03be) = e\u2212r\u03be\nthe tests have good power against alternatives, which increases with the extent of violation of the null hypothesis. Corresponding results when testing \u02dcH0 with \u03b1 = 1.8 are given in Table S16.\nThe case of unknown\u02db\nIn practice, the true value of stability index \u03b1 will typically be unknown and need to be estimated from data. Suppose the hypothesis of interest is\n\u02dcH\u20320 : X \u223c \u02dcS\u03b1(\u03b4, ), for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2), \u03b4 \u2208 Rp and some measure on S p,\nTo test this hypothesis, we again use the test based on the statistic in (21), but now generate the artificial data X0n from the SP law S\u03b1\u0302(\u0302\u03b4,\u0302 ), where \u03b1\u0302, \u0302\u03b4 and \u0302 are projection estimates obtained as outlined in Section S5 of the supplement. Note that data can be generated fromS\u03b1\u0302(\u0302\u03b4,\u0302 ) using the stochastic representation in (22) with \u03b10 replaced by \u03b1\u0302. The bootstrap procedure for obtaining critical values follows similarly to the procedure described in Sect. 7.1.\nThe empirical rejection percentages (for the bivariate case, p = 2) are shown in Table 7 for several distributions. Note that when observations are sampled from a S1.8\ndistribution (symmetric SP law with stability index 1.8), the rejection percentages are close to the nominal level, indicating that the test has reasonable empirical size.\nAs alternatives, we consider the skew normal (SN\u03bd), symmetric Laplace and generalized Gaussian (GG\u03bd) distributions. An observation X from the GG\u03bd distribution (refer to Cadirci et al. 2022) is generated according to X = UV 1/\u03bd , whereU is uniform on S p\u22121 and V \u223c Gamma(p/\u03bd, 2). Table 7 shows that the proposed test procedure has power against non-SP alternatives, and noting the increase in power associated with increasing sample size, the results suggest that the procedure is consistent against non-SP alternatives."

            "heading": "7.2 The high-dimensional case",
            "text": "It should be clear that so far, and despite the fact that the new test applies to any dimension p, the underlying setting is not that of high dimension (p > n). In this connection we point out that the extension of goodness-of-fit methods specifically tailored for the classical \u201csmall p\u2013large n\u201d regime to high or infinite dimension is not straightforward, and therefore it is beyond the scope of the present article. This is not restricted to our setting alone but applies more generally, and the collections of Goia and Vieu (2016) and Kokoszka et al. (2017) reflect the need for statistical methods specifically tailored for non-classical settings. If we restrict it to our context, in the latter settings such methods have so far been mostly confined to testing for normality and the interested reader is referred to Bugni et al. (2009), Nieto-Reyes et al. (2014), B\u00e1rcenas et al. (2017), Kellner and Celisse (2019), Yamada and Himeno (2019), Jiang et al. (2019), G\u00f3recki et al. (2020), Henze and Jim\u00e9nez-Gamero (2021), Chen and Xia (2023) and Chen and Genton (2023). If however the setting is that of regression, with or without conditional heteroskedasticity, the number of parameters rapidly increases with the dimension p. This is one extra reason that corresponding specification methods in high/infinite dimension need to be treated separately, and in this connection the methods of Cuesta-Albertos et al. (2019) and Rice et al. (2020) appear to be of the few available for testing the (auto)regression function.\nFor an illustration of the special circumstances that are brought forward as the dimension grows, consider the test statistic in (10) for \u03b10 = 2 and without standardization, i.e. replace Y j by X j \u223c S2(0, Ip), j = 1, . . . , n. Then from (11), and by using the density of the p-variate normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix 2Ip, we obtain\nr (x; 2) = (\u03c0\nr\n) p 2 e\u2212\u2016x\u20162/(4r),\nand consequently\nTn,r = 1 n\n\u239b\n\u239d\nn \u2211 j=1 r (0; 2) + n \u2211 j =k r (X j \u2212 Xk; 2)\n\u239e\n\u23a0+ n r+2(0; 2)\n\u22122 n \u2211\nj=1 r+1(X j ; 2)\n= 1 n\n\u239b\n\u239d\nn \u2211\nj=1\n(\u03c0\nr\n) p 2 + n \u2211\nj =k\n(\u03c0\nr\n) p 2 e\u2212\u2016X j\u2212Xk\u20162/(4r)\n\u239e \u23a0+ n ( \u03c0\nr + 2 )\np 2\n\u22122 n \u2211\nj=1\n(\n\u03c0 r + 1 )\np 2\ne\u2212\u2016X j\u20162/(4(r+1)).\nNow the quantity \u2016X j\u20162 = \u2211pk=1 X2jk behaves like 2p + OP( \u221a p) = 2p(1 +\nOP(1/ \u221a p)), and thus our test statistic contains sums of terms, each of which is of the order e\u22122p, as p \u2192 \u221e. (For simplicity we suppress the terms 4r and 4(r + 1) which occur as denominators in these sums, as they are anyway irrelevant to our argument).\nIn order to get a feeling of this result, write \u2016X j\u20162 = 2\u2211pk=1(X jk/ \u221a 2)2 =: 2Sp, where, due to Gaussianity and independence, Sp is distributed as chi-squared with p degrees of freedom. Thus the expectation of the quantity e\u2212\u2016X j\u20162 figuring in Tn,r coincides with the value of the CF of this chi-squared distribution computed at the point t = 2i . To proceed further, notice that the CF of Sp/p at a point t is given by the CF corresponding to Sp computed at t/p, and recall that the CF of the chi-squared distribution with p degrees of freedom is given by \u03d5Sp (t) = (1\u2212 2i t)\u2212p/2. Hence, in obvious notation,\nlim p\u2192\u221e \u03d5 Spp (t) = lim p\u2192\u221e\n(\n1 \u2212 2i t p\n)\u2212p/2 = eit ,\nand reverting back to the CF of Sp we get \u03d5Sp (t) \u2248 eipt , and thus \u03d5Sp (2i) \u2248 e\u22122p, as p \u2192 \u221e. A similar reasoning applies to \u2016X j \u2212 Xk\u20162 implying that the expectation of e\u2212\u2016X j\u2212Xk\u20162 (also occurring in Tn,r ) being approximated by e\u22124p, as p \u2192 \u221e.\nHence, by using these approximations, we obtain\nTn,r \u2248 (\u03c0\nr\n) p 2 + n ( \u03c0 r + 2 )\np 2\n, p \u2192 \u221e,\nfrom which it follows that\nTn,r \u2192\n\u23a7\n\u23aa \u23a8\n\u23aa \u23a9 \u221e for r < \u03c0, 1, for r = \u03c0, 0, for r > \u03c0.\nas p \u2192 \u221e. Consequently our test statistic degenerates in high dimension, a fact that calls for proper high-dimensionalmodifications of the test criterion, which is definitely a worthwhile subject for future research.\nNevertheless, we have obtained some initial Monte Carlo results that show a reasonable performance for the test criterion in cases where the dimension is much higher\nthan the maximum p = 6 considered so far. These results may be found in Tables S18 and S19 of the Supplement."

The complete data set (available from Yahoo! Finance) consists of 1,891 log returns. We model the log returns using the CCC-GARCH(1, 1) model (with intercept) given by\nY j = \u03c9 + Q1/2j \u03b5 j , j = 1, . . . , n, (25)\nwhere Q j is as in (16) with \u03bax = \u03baq = 1 and B1 assumed diagonal. We are interested in determining whether the innovations \u03b5 j have a bivariate stable distribution. Since the innovations are unobserved, we apply our test to the residuals \u03b5\u0302 j = \u0302Q\u22121/2j (Y j\u2212\u03c9\u0302), where the estimates\u0302Q j and \u03c9\u0302 are obtained using EbE estimation as discussed earlier. To obtain critical values of the tests, we apply the bootstrap algorithm of Sect. 6.2 with B = 1, 000.\nTable 8 shows that, when a stability index of \u03b1 \u2208 {1.75, 1.8} is assumed, the tests based on Tr do not reject the null hypothesis that the CCC-GARCH-(1, 1) innovations have a S\u03b1 distribution (at a 10% level of significance). On the other hand, the null hypothesis of stable innovations is rejected when a stability index of \u03b1 = {1.7, 1.85, 1.9, 2} is assumed.\nThe correct choice of the innovation distribution has important implications for value-at-risk (VaR) forecasts. For the considered stable distributions, we fit the model in (25) to the first 1,000 observations and calculated one-step-ahead 5% and 1% portfolio VaR forecasts for long and short positions for the remaining time period (i.e. 891 forecasts for each position). The portfolio is assumed to consist of 50% AAL shares and 50% RIO shares.\nTable 8 shows the empirical coverage rates of the forecasted VaR bounds, that is, the proportion of times that the value of the portfolio exceeded the bounds. For the cases where our test supports the null hypothesis, i.e. when \u03b1 \u2208 {1.75, 1.8}, the empirical coverage rates of the value-at-risk bounds are quite close to the nominal rates. In addition, the p-values of Christofferson\u2019s (1998) LRcc test (given in brackets in Table 8), indicate that, if the stability index of the innovation distribution is chosen either too high or too low, the true conditional coverage rates of the forecasted VaR bounds are significantly different from the nominal rates."
