A total of eight online databases were searched from inception to September 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). e control group was treated with Western medicine (WM) alone, whereas the experimental group was treated with a combined NYCH and WM therapy. A total of 30 RCTs involving 2562 participants were ultimately included. NYCH therapy combined with conventional WM delayed the onset time (days) of RTOM (MD 10.80, p< 0.001), and at that time, a higher cumulative radiotherapy dose (Gy) (MD 5.72, p< 0.001) was completed in the experimental group. e combination regimen also reduced the incidence of severe oral mucositis (Grade III\u2013IV) (RR 0.25, p< 0.001). In addition, the treatment e cacy of the experimental group was signi cantly better than that of the control group (RR 1.31, p< 0.001). Compared with the patients in the control group, the experimental group had lower xerostomia scores (MD -1.07, p< 0.001) and more saliva (MD 0.36, p< 0.001). NYCH combined with WM improved the e cacy of treating RTOM in NPC. is study provides a su cient basis for conducting further large RCTs to prove the e cacy of NYCH."

Radiotherapy is the most important\ntherapy for NPC, and the 5-year survival rate of patients with NPC after treatment is as high as 83.2% [3]. Despite the remarkable therapeutic e\u00a5ects of radiotherapy on NPC, the salivary glands are damaged after this therapy due to irradiation. e changes in the quantity, nature, and composition of saliva cause several complications, and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis (RTOM) is the most common disease plaguing patients.

Oral mucositis is characterized by erythema and fused ulcers, and its main clinical symptoms include reduced salivation, xerostomia, oral pain, dehydration, taste disturbance, and malnutrition. In addition, severe long-term reactions can lead to difficulties in swallowing and speaking, sleep disorders, ageusia, dental caries, and oral infections [6]. Moreover, severe oral mucositis can result in reduced compliance with treatment, reduced doses of concurrent chemotherapy, or interruption of radiotherapy [7], leading to a lower quality of life, weight loss, prolonged hospital stays, and the use of additional analgesic and anti-infective drugs, thereby increasing the financial and emotional burden of patients [8]. Various therapeutic approaches have been used to prevent and treat RTOM with considerable efficacy, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF); borax gargle; sodium bicarbonate injection; vitamin B12; lidocaine gargle; analgesics such as morphine and fentanyl; antibiotics; and glucocorticoids, when necessary [9\u201311]. However, the efficacy of these approaches is not yet satisfactory.\nIn recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners have conducted several useful studies on the prevention and treatment of RTOM. -e studies included Chinese medicine oral administration [12], Chinese medicine aerosol inhalation [13], Chinese medicine gargle [14], acupuncture [15], and Chinese patent medicine such as Shuangliao Houfeng Powder [16]. In Chinese medicine, oral administration is widely used, and therapies include nourishing yin and clearing heat, cooling blood and promoting fluid production, and removing toxins for relieving sore throats. Nourishing Yin and clearing heat (NYCH) decoction orally was the most common and effective in preventing and treating RTOM in NPC. However, the current available studies were all small sample sizes, and TCM efficacy in treating RTOM has not yet been elucidated in large-scale stage 3 clinical trials. RTOM is rarely treated with TCM in other countries. To assess the clinical efficacy of TCM (NYCH therapy) in treating RTOM, we conducted a literature review to retrieve clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and performed a meta-analysis. In addition to the efficacy, we also investigated the medication rules of TCM in the treatment of RTOM and tried to elucidate the potential mechanism of TCM active ingredients."

According to the PICOS principle (population, intervention, comparators, outcomes, study design), we searched eight electronic databases, including the Excerpta Medica Database (Embase) (https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/ovid/\nembase), Public Medicine (PubMed) (https://pubmed.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) (https://www.bionity.com/en/ encyclopedia/MEDLINE), Cochrane Library (https://www. cochranelibrary.com), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (https://www.cnki.net), Vipshop Chinese Journal Database (VIP) (http://www.cqvip.com), Wanfang Database (https://www.wanfangdata.com.cn), and China Biomedical Literature Service system (CBM) (http://www. sinomed.ac.cn). -e search terms included \u2018nasopharyngeal neoplasm, radiation therapy, oral mucositis, traditional Chinese medicine and randomized controlled trials.\u2019 -e details of the search strategies are included in Supplement 1. All studies included in the search were published from the establishment of the abovementioned databases until September 2021. In addition, a manual search was conducted to avoid omissions in the literature search and to identify RCTs that might meet the inclusion criteria of the present study. All searches were restricted to human RCTs, excluding animal trials and fundamental research, and the search was conducted independently by two researchers.\n2.2. InclusionandExclusionCriteria. Based on the aim of the present study, the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were as follows: (1) patients aged 18 years or older, male or female; (2) pathologically confirmed diagnosis of NPC, regardless of the type of pathology; (3) first concurrent radiotherapy for NPC and no previous radiotherapy to the head and neck; (4) no oral mucositis caused by other diseases; (5) RCTs, whether blinded or not; (6) complete data on outcome indicators, which can be extracted directly or indirectly for statistical analysis; (7) outcome indicators related to RTOM, (8) internal heat owing to Yin deficiency on TCM syndrome differentiation typing; and (9) full-text literature in Chinese or English that meets the aforementioned criteria.\n-e exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) animal studies or nonclinical studies; (2) articles with inconsistent studies or poor study designs; and (3) articles with incomplete data on outcome indicators and incorrect statistical methods that could not be corrected.\n2.3. Interventions. -e control group received conventional WM, including gentamicin, metronidazole, tinidazole, dexamethasone, prednisone, lidocaine, procaine, tetracaine, borax gargle, alpha-chymotrypsin, vitamin B12, vitamin C, rhEGF, and rhG-CSF. -e detailed medicine for every study is shown in Table 1.\n-e experimental group received NYCH therapy combined with WM (oral administration).\n2.4. Outcome Indicators. -e outcome indicators were as follows: (1) overall effective rate of oral mucositis (the details of evaluation criteria for the overall effective rate of oral mucositis are included in Supplement 2); (2) incidence of Grade III\u2013IV oral mucositis (the details of oral mucositis grading are included in Supplement 3.1); (3) time to the onset of oral mucositis and cumulative radiotherapy dose at\nthe time of onset; (4) xerostomia scores (the details of xerostomia scores are included in Supplement 3.2); and (5) stimulated total saliva flow rate (the details of stimulated total saliva flow rate are included in Supplement 4).\n2.5.

After collecting the data related to RCTs according to the requirements of our meta-analysis, statistical analysis was performed using RevMan (version 5.4) provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. -e risk ratio (RR) was used as an effect indicator because the overall effective rate of oral mucositis and the incidence of Grade III\u2013IV oral mucositis were dichotomous variables. However, because the remaining outcome indicators were continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD) were used as effect indicators. Each effect size was expressed as a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). -e chi-square (\u03c72) test was used to test for heterogeneity in the results of studies included in the literature. A criterion of p> 0.10p> 0.10 and I2\u2264 50% indicated that there was no statistical heterogeneity among studies, and the data were combined for analysis using a fixed effects model. However,\na criterion of p< 0.10 and I2 > 50% indicated statistical heterogeneity among studies and required analysis using a random effects model or, if necessary, a subgroup or sensitivity analysis. Funnel plots were used to assess potential publication bias for the included studies. For all analyses, p< 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference."

To date, meta-analyses related to NYCH therapy of RTOM in NPC have not been reported.\nIn our study, a total of 30 RCTs (n\ufffd 2562) were included for meta-analysis. -e results revealed that NYCH therapy was effective in the prevention and treatment of RTOM in NPC. First, the overall effective rate of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group. Notably, the incidence of severe oral mucositis (Grade III\u2013IV) was lower in the experimental group than in the control group, especially the incidence of Grade IV oral mucositis, indicating superior efficacy of the experimental group compared with the control group. Moreover, treatment efficacy was evaluated at two different points in time of a cumulative dose of 40Gy and 70Gy, and the results revealed that the incidence of Grade III\u2013IV oral mucositis was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group at both doses. -ese findings suggest that NYCH therapy not only reduces the incidence of RTOM in NPC but also prevents the progression of mild or moderate-to-severe oral mucositis. Second, compared with the control group, the experimental group had a significantly delayed onset of acute oral"

Heat can be turned into fire, which can burn body fluid and exhaust Qi, resulting in Qi-Yin deficiency, thus producing symptoms such as xerostomia, sore throat, oral ulcers, and dysphagia. -erefore, TCM practitioners usually use Chinese herbal medicines that benefit Qi, nourish Yin, clear heat, and detoxify toxins to treat radiation injuries, such as RTOM.\nScreening for active ingredients and assessing the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of TCM were also performed in the current research. Our study found 13 Chinese herbal medicines with a high frequency of application in NYCH therapy (Table 2). It was revealed that the main active ingredients in all 13 medicines [17, 27, 49\u201361] included flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, sterols, coumarins, and emodin, which have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and wound healing effects. -e anti-inflammatory mechanism may be related to the inhibition of signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt), Janus kinase-signal transducers, and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) [62\u201369]. In vitro experiments showed that acetylated iridoid glycosides obtained from Radix scrophulariae had a stimulating effect on the growth of human epidermal fibroblasts, which may be a potential mechanism to promote wound healing [17, 55, 56]. Future research should investigate the potential mechanisms of modern pharmacology for NYCH therapy, especially the 13 Chinese herbal medicines that were reported herein to have a high frequency of application.\n-e present meta-analysis had some limitations. First, most studies included had unclear methods of randomization, unclear allocation concealment, unblinded designs, no placebo controls, no loss to follow-up or withdrawals, and no intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Second, the experimental groups varied in drug composition, administered dose, method of administration, frequency of administration, and duration of administration. In addition, conventional WM treatments were not uniform and could not be systematically summarized.\n-e results of this research revealed that NYCH therapy was effective in preventing and treating RTOM in NPC, providing a basis for future multicenter and high-quality RCTs to develop guidance for clinical treatment. Modern pharmacological studies have reported herbal formulas used for NYCH therapy with a large number of anti-inflammatory and analgesic herbal monomers.-ese herbal medicines are viable alternatives to unsatisfactory WM therapy and may accelerate Chinese medicine pharmacology development."
