    "abstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has forced higher education institutions to shift their teaching activities from traditional face-to-face to online learning. This brings a great challenge to the creativity training of vocational college students, who not only learn theoretical knowledge but also cultivate technical skills. Therefore, it is very important to explore the influencing factors of online learning on students\u2019 creativity during the epidemic. By relying on the related literature review, an extensive model is developed by integrating the expectation confirmation model (ECM), technology task fit model (TTF), and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to illustrate key factors that influence creativity. Based on the proposed model, theory-based hypotheses are tested through structural equation modeling employing empirical data gathered through a survey questionnaire of 229 students from different vocational colleges in China. In addition, to extend the analysis results, this paper performs a comparative analysis based on gender. The findings demonstrate that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness significantly influence knowledge sharing; knowledge sharing significantly affects creativity. However, there is no substantial relationship between perceived usefulness and attitude, and no relationship between attitude and knowledge sharing. Moreover, a multi-group comparison shows that there is a significant gender difference between perceived ease of use and attitude. Based on the findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

This brings\na great challenge to the creativity training of vocational college students,\nwho not only learn theoretical knowledge but also cultivate technical skills.\nTherefore, it is very important to explore the influencing factors of online\nlearning on students\u2019 creativity during the epidemic. By relying on the\nrelated literature review, an extensive model is developed by integrating the\nexpectation confirmation model (ECM), technology task fit model (TTF), and\nthe technology acceptance model (TAM) to illustrate key factors that influence\ncreativity. Based on the proposed model, theory-based hypotheses are tested\nthrough structural equation modeling employing empirical data gathered\nthrough a survey questionnaire of 229 students from different vocational\ncolleges in China. In addition, to extend the analysis results, this paper\nperforms a comparative analysis based on gender. The findings demonstrate\nthat perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness significantly influence\nknowledge sharing; knowledge sharing significantly affects creativity.\nHowever, there is no substantial relationship between perceived usefulness\nand attitude, and no relationship between attitude and knowledge sharing.\nMoreover, a multi-group comparison shows that there is a significant gender\ndifference between perceived ease of use and attitude. Based on the findings,\ntheoretical and practical implications are discussed.\nKEYWORDS\nonline learning, creativity, technology acceptance model, expectation confirmation model, technology task fit model, gender\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 11 August 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.967890"

            "text": "COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis that has transformed countries around the world in just a few months, with the disease now spreading to more than 220 countries and territories (Mani et\u00a0 al., 2020). To effectively deal with the spread of the virus, countries began to implement quarantine policies. For many industries, the consequences of the pandemic are unstoppable and uncontrollable. Perhaps, the most significant of these are major changes in national education systems, so teachers and students have to adapt to new teaching methods, even though most may not be\u00a0fully prepared to deal with the sudden changes (Crawford and Cifuentes-Faura, 2022). According to UNESCO, the closure of schools has led to 50% of students receiving education through the Internet. Many educational institutions maintain the continuity of education through online teaching to ensure that students can study normally (Alfadda and Mahdi, 2021). The demand for online learning during the epidemic is very large and growing rapidly (Moser et\u00a0al., 2020). The online education market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 16.4% from 2016 to 2023. With the rapid development of the Internet, perhaps, the teaching mode of school will change in 10 to 15 years. Online learning is more and more favored by learners (Shahzad et\u00a0al., 2020).\nCreativity is defined as a person\u2019s ability to generate new and useful ideas and come up with solutions to problems by recombining and matching information and knowledge (Amabile and Pratt, 2016). Training students\u2019 creativity has become a critical task in a modern society that values innovation and creation (Wang and Miao, 2015). According to Jahnke et\u00a0 al. (2015), students\u2019 creativity is becoming more important in the 21st century, and students with creativity are more curious and capable of coming up with novel ideas and problem-solving solutions. Simultaneously, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in an exponential increase in the use of online learning. Therefore, the research on students\u2019 creativity in the online learning environment has attracted a large number of scholars\u2019 close attention (Cohen and Davidovitch, 2020). For example, Afari et\u00a0al. (2013) believe that all creativity begins with interaction, knowledge sharing, and motivation, so it is productive to cultivate creativity in an online learning environment. The study by Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al. (2017) demonstrates that online learning provides an open environment for students, enabling them to exchange knowledge with others and enhance their creativity. Zulfikar (2020) confirms that collaborative digital platforms have a significant impact on students\u2019 creativity, initiative, and critical thinking. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that students\u2019 use of online learning systems is critical to improving their creativity.\nPrevious research has shown that online learning has an impact on student creativity (Afari et\u00a0al., 2013; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al., 2017). For example, Lee (2018) used social technology and social capital theory to examine for the first time how knowledge sharing affects individual creativity among college students in online learning, as well as the mediating effect of knowledge sharing on individual creativity. Yeh et\u00a0al. (2012)\nused the hybrid knowledge management model, to integrate online learning and the three core processes of knowledge management (knowledge sharing, knowledge internalization, and knowledge creation) to study how to improve students\u2019 creativity. The results showed that the hybrid knowledge management model is effective in improving knowledge, dispositions, and creativity. The research of Rasheed et\u00a0 al. (2020) demonstrated that the use of social media is related to students\u2019 creativity and participation. Knowledge sharing is the potential reason to explain these relationships. Tsai et\u00a0al. (2015) investigated 579 students in the department of tourism and hotel management to study how positive and negative online learning environments are related to students\u2019 motivation and knowledge-sharing behaviors, thus affecting creativity. The results revealed that a positive online learning environment is related to intrinsic motivation and knowledge sharing, thus promoting creativity. A negative online learning environment is not conducive to creativity.\nHowever, few studies involved the influencing factors of vocational college students\u2019 creativity in the online learning situation during COVID-19. Vocational education is crucial to the development of a country, promoting employment and enhancing competitiveness. Its unique value stems from its potential to improve learners\u2019 ability to acquire knowledge, cultivate skills, and develop creativity (Teclehaimanot et\u00a0 al., 2012). Among them, knowledge acquisition and skill cultivation strive to improve the overall quality of learners, such as creative problem solving. In addition, the rapid development of information technology has led to disruptive changes in work, study, and life patterns, which makes it impossible for learners to master all the knowledge and skills to deal with the future world (Phan, 2021). Toivanen et\u00a0al. (2011) pointed out that developing creativity is important in a highly competitive and changing learning environment, where students have to deal with market demands and keep their competitive edge.\nDifferent from previous studies, this study aims to explore the influencing factors of vocational college students\u2019 creativity in the online learning situation during COVID-19. The specific differences are as follows: Firstly, this study integrates the three models of TTF, ECM, and TAM as the theoretical basis, while previous studies on creativity are mainly from the perspective of social technology and social capital theory (Lee, 2018; Fatemi et\u00a0al., 2022). Secondly, the research object is vocational college students. Thirdly, the multi-group analysis is conducted to test whether gender differences existed in the creativity of vocational college students. The findings may provide a new direction for the development of online learning after the epidemic. Therefore, the questions of this study are as follows:\nRQ 1: What are the influencing factors of vocational college students\u2019 creativity in online learning situation?\nRQ 2: To what extent do the influencing factors explain the creativity of vocational college students?\nRQ 3: Are there gender differences in the impact of influencing factors on the creativity of vocational college students?\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nResearch model, literature review, and hypotheses"

However, with the deepening of research, TTF and TAM models have their own limitations. For example, Nance and Straub (1996) pointed out that TAM focused on the individual beliefs of technology acceptance from the perspective of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, that is, the user\u2019s attitude toward information technology, but it lacked consideration of user differences and could not explain whether the technology required by the task could be\u00a0provided. TTF, on the other hand, focuses on user acceptability of technology by considering the fit between task and technological qualities and pays relatively greater attention to object study (Dishaw and Strong, 1999; Strong et\u00a0al., 2006; Widagdo and Susanto, 2016). While TTF includes tasks and technological characteristics, it does not incorporate the users\u2019 accepted beliefs about technology, which are at the heart of TAM. The TAM and TTF models explain the use of information systems from different perspectives on tasks, technology, and individual users.\nIn order to improve the predictive relevance and coefficient of determination of the model, this study built a model for the influencing factors of vocational college students\u2019 creativity in the online learning during the COVID-19 based on ECT, TTF, and TAM, and identified seven main constructs. At the same time, it is assumed that gender might adjust each model path. The research model is shown in Figure\u00a01."

The theory is initially used to study consumers\u2019 purchase and repurchase behaviors, that is, the difference between psychological expectation and actual perception after purchase will affect users\u2019 re-purchase behaviors. In addition, the continuous use of information systems is similar to repeated purchases. As a result, Weber (2001) proposed using ECT to explain users\u2019 intention of continuous use of the information system, borrowing the concept of perceived usefulness from TAM to replace expected use, and modifying ECT to generate ECM.\u201d As research progresses, many academics employ the ECM as the theoretical foundation to explore the continuous use behavior of diverse information systems (Wang et\u00a0al., 2019; Zuniga-Jara, 2021). For example, Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b) combined TTF with ECM to test whether online learning assists students complete learning tasks during the pandemic and enhances their willingness to continue using online learning in the future. The results show that the overall research framework\nlargely explains the intention of continuous use. Hai et\u00a0al. (2020) modified and extended the ECM by adding cognitive and emotional variables (including intrinsic motivation, attitude, and curiosity), with the purpose of exploring the potential factors of continuous learning willingness in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) setting. According to the findings, the model could account for 48% of persistent use intentions. Lu et\u00a0 al. (2019) expanded the ECM by adding Flow theory to study the driving factors of MOOC satisfaction and the impact of satisfaction on user behavior. The results show that flow and interest are important variables to improve MOOC satisfaction based on ECT. According to the preceding literature, ECM can be\u00a0utilized to describe the impact of an online learning environment on students\u2019 actual learning experiences."

Based on Ajzen and Fishbie\u2019s Theory of Rational Action (TRA; Davis, 1989) developed TAM to construct a research framework among attitude, intention, and behavior. Two indispensable variables in the model, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, will affect the user\u2019s attitude and behavioral intention to use a new technology. TAM is widely used by most researchers in this field, which proves that TAM has significant explanatory power and simplicity, and the theoretical model has become more mature (Tan and Hew, 2017; Esteban-Millat et\u00a0al., 2018). For example, Wang et\u00a0al. (2021a) used learning satisfaction theory, TAM, and intelligent learning environments to build a research framework for active online learning, put forward an online intelligent teaching model, and discussed how to promote active online learning in an intelligent environment. Al-Emran et\u00a0al. (2020) constructed an integrated model that incorporated TAM, planned behavior theory (TPB), and ECM to explain the major predictors of continuous usage of online learning. Al-Adwan et\u00a0al. (2021) integrate the Information System Success Model (ISSM) and TAM to explain the key factors affecting the success of e-learning systems. Based on the TAM, Wiardi et\u00a0al.

            "text": "With the deepening of research, scholars gradually pay attention to the relationship between information systems and users\u2019 personal behaviors. Goodhue and Thompson studied earlier and proposed a model called TTF. The model assumes that the acceptance of technology depends on how the technology meets the needs of specific tasks and reflects the logical relationship between information technology and task requirements (Goodhuedale and Thompsonronald, 1995). According to this model, in order to\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nensure the success of any technology, it is necessary to identify the tasks using technology and the fit between tasks and technologies. This task technology fit refers to the consistency between task requirements, personal capabilities, and technical functions. In the context of COVID-19, the online learning model is a technological feature in itself, and learning objectives are a task when the pandemic breaks out. Students\u2019 online learning is expected to be\u00a0better when the task fits the technology (Wu and Chen, 2016). Many researchers combine TTF with other theories to explain students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 online learning behaviors (Alyoussef, 2021; Kori and Pedaste, 2021). For example, Shanshan and Wenfei (2022) studied the impact of quality factors on the intention of continuous use of MOOCS from the perspective of quality based on teaching and platform, integrating ECM, TTF, flow theory, and trust. Wan et\u00a0 al. (2020) surveyed the determinants of college students\u2019 satisfaction to continue using MOOCs by integrating the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), TTF, and user satisfaction. Kissi et\u00a0al. (2018) investigated the students\u2019 desire for video-based instruction (VBI) in the flipped classroom teaching method and expanded the UTAUT model by adding learning family conflict, perceived control over time, and TTF."

            "text": "In the TTF, technical characteristics refer to the technologies used by individuals to perform tasks, and task characteristics refer to the actions taken by individuals when converting input\ninto output. Considering that the fit between task and technology is the core of the TTF model, if the technology can meet the needs of the task, users will be\u00a0 more willing to use the new technology and think that the technology is easy to use. A higher fit indicates a higher perception of ease of use. TTF has an indirect impact on the \u201cperceived usefulness\u201d through the \u201cperceived ease of use\u201d (Yen et\u00a0al., 2010; Wu and Chen, 2016; Shanshan and Wenfei, 2022). This study integrates TTF into our research framework to investigate its impact on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. On this basis, the following assumptions are proposed:\nH1: The TTF has a significant impact on perceived ease of use of online learning system.\nH2: The TTF has a significant impact on perceived usefulness of online learning system.\nConfirmation is defined as \u201cthe user\u2019s perception of the consistency between the information system\u2019s use expectations and its actual performance\u201d (Bhattacherjee, 2001). Bhattacherjee (2001) pointed out that the user\u2019s confirmation of an information system can enhance the user\u2019s perceived usefulness of the platform, and the user\u2019s unacknowledged expectation of the system will reduce the user\u2019s perceived usefulness (Cheng, 2020; Shahzad et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2021b). In addition, when users get the confirmation of technology, their perceived ease of use of technology will become more specific. Therefore, the degree of\nFIGURE\u00a01 Research framework for online learning and creativity.\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nusers\u2019 confirmation of technology will have a positive impact on perceived ease of use (Hong et\u00a0 al., 2006). On this basis, the following assumptions are proposed:\nH3: The confirmation has a significant impact on perceived ease of use of online learning.\nH4: The confirmation has a significant impact on perceived usefulness of online learning.\nThe relationship between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude toward knowledge sharing has been confirmed by existing studies (Gefen et\u00a0al., 2000; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2019). In this study, attitudes refer to students\u2019 subjective feelings, positive or negative, when they use online learning platforms to share knowledge with others. Perceived usefulness refers to vocational college students\u2019 comprehensive judgment of the online learning system to improve their learning effects. Perceived ease of use refers to learners\u2019 judgment on the difficulty of operation and interaction of an online learning system. Davis (1989) pointed out that under the same other conditions, perceived ease of use can predict perceived usefulness, because the increase of perceived ease of use helps to improve performance. Users are more likely to use the system if they can obtain a large amount of more useful information with simple operations while saving time (Gangwar et\u00a0al., 2015; Arpaci, 2016; Shiau and Chau, 2016). TAM further points out that perceived ease of use is determined by external factors, perceived usefulness is jointly determined by external factors and perceived ease of use, and attitude is jointly determined by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. On this basis, the following assumptions are proposed:\nH5: Perceived ease of use has a significant impact on perceived usefulness.\nH6: Perceived ease of use has a significant impact on attitudes toward knowledge sharing.\nH7: Perceived usefulness has a significant impact on knowledge sharing.\nIn previous studies, different scholars had different views on knowledge sharing. From a learning perspective, Marks et\u00a0 al. (2008) believe that knowledge sharing can help learners study knowledge and improve their abilities\u2014not only pure learning but also the ability to turn knowledge into action. Two key dimensions of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in the TAM are used to explain knowledge-sharing behavior (Ahn et\u00a0al., 2007; Papadopoulos et\u00a0al., 2013; Ku, 2014). For example, Yu et\u00a0al. (2010) discovered a significant positive correlation between perceived usefulness and knowledge sharing. When users perceive the usefulness of the online platform and assist themselves, the likelihood of knowledge sharing with others increases.\nYuan et\u00a0al. (2016) demonstrated that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a significant impact on knowledge sharing in online communities. On this basis, the following assumptions are proposed:\nH8: Perceived ease of use has a significant impact on knowledge sharing in an online learning system.\nH9: Perceived usefulness has a significant impact on knowledge sharing in an online learning system.\nBukowitz (1999) described knowledge sharing as an activity of knowledge exchange (such as information, professional knowledge, or ability) between people. Knowledge-sharing attitudes can be\u00a0defined as the degree to which individuals agree with knowledge sharing or actively share knowledge with others (Hutchings and Michailova, 2004). Previous studies have proved that knowledge-sharing attitude is an important predictor of knowledge sharing (Ramayah et\u00a0al., 2013; Jolaee et\u00a0al., 2014). Students who have a positive attitude toward knowledge sharing will have a positive impact on their willingness to share, which means that the more positive their attitude toward knowledge sharing, the stronger their willingness to share knowledge with others online (Fauzi et\u00a0al., 2018). Arpaci (2016) pointed out in his research that knowledge-sharing attitude has a significant impact on knowledge-sharing willingness, and knowledgesharing willingness has a significant impact on knowledgesharing behavior. On this basis, the following assumptions are proposed:\nH10: The attitude of knowledge sharing in online learning has a significant impact on knowledge sharing.\nKnowledge sharing can be\u00a0 regarded as a process of information transmission and creativity generation, because it can help learners generate new ideas in the process of communicating with others (Grant, 1996). Previous studies have shown that knowledge sharing contributes to creativity (Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al., 2017; Lee, 2018). For example, Koranteng et\u00a0al. (2019) believed that when students communicate information and knowledge with others, they will increase their creative ideas, so as to improve their creativity. Kirkwood (2010) pointed out that when students interact with others socially and communicate with each other, they build a learning community where they can learn from each other and express their views. Students who participate in this learning community maintain more participation in learning and are more creative in learning. Aamir Amin and Hassan (2011) pointed out that knowledge is the most important factor in promoting individual creativity. We\u00a0 can obtain high-quality information by sharing our knowledge with others. At the same time, we\u00a0can combine it with our own knowledge, internalize it, and finally generate new ideas. According to (Kirkwood, 2010); R\u00fczgar (2005), students who investigate more information or knowledge on the Internet are more creative in their learning and\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\ncan stimulate creativity. On this basis, the following assumptions are proposed:\nH11: Knowledge sharing has a significant impact on creativity."

Gender differences are taken into account in various studies in the field of organizational behavior (Boateng et\u00a0al., 2015; Ahanchian et\u00a0al., 2017; Ganji and Johnson, 2020). More and more researchers are focusing on the differences in technology acceptance between men and women. For example, Tarhini et\u00a0al. (2014) found in their research that when gender is used as a regulating variable, the explanatory power of the TAM increases to 52%. Ong and Lai (2006) surveyed 67 female and 89 male employees in six different companies in Taiwan. The results showed that women pay more attention to the ease of use of online learning tools, while men pay more attention to perceived usefulness to determine their behavioral intention to use online learning tools. Davis, (1989) pointed out that there are some gender differences in users\u2019 attitudes toward the use of information systems. Although the impact of gender differences on creativity has not been fully clarified, previous studies have suggested that men are more adventurous and curious to try new things (Alfadda and Mahdi, 2021). Therefore, men are more creative than women (Smith et\u00a0al., 2016). In this context, the relationship between online learning and creativity is expected to be\u00a0at different levels between male and female groups. If this difference exists, the attitudes of women and men toward knowledge sharing and the impact of knowledge sharing on men\u2019s and women\u2019s creativity are also different. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that there are gender differences in the impact of online learning on students\u2019 creativity. We\u00a0can better understand and gain insight into the impact of online learning on students\u2019 creativity by investigating the regulatory role of gender."

The accepted Q2 must be\u00a0greater than zero (Hair et\u00a0al., 2014; Kock, 2018). Table\u00a07 shows that the proposed model has sufficient predictive power."

In this study, the above criteria are met. Secondly, as suggested by Matthews (2017), the compositional invariance test suggests that original correlations should be\u00a0equal to or greater than the 5.00% quantile correlations. Table\u00a010 shows that the composite variance test of all potential variables meets the criteria. Third, evaluate the equality of composite variables and mean values in each group. For invariance to be\u00a0established, the first column (mean original difference) must be\u00a0a number that falls within the 95% confidence interval. Table\u00a011 shows that the first part of the results does not meet the requirements. The results in Table\u00a0 12 show that the variance-original difference values of attitude and perceived ease of use do not fall within the 95% confidence interval. Therefore, the second part of the result does not meet the requirements. When steps 1 and 2 are satisfied but step\u00a03 is not, partial measurement invariance is provided. In fact, partial measurement invariance is sufficient to perform PLS-MGA to compare the structural paths between groups, allowing for multi-group analysis (Henseler et\u00a0al., 2015).\nFinally, assessment of group differences. After the measurement consistency is established, differences between male and female populations are tested using PLS\u2013MGA. Multigroup analysis is often used to evaluate the differences between the theoretical models proposed by researchers in different sample groups. Table\u00a013 tests the difference between the path coefficient and the composite\u2019s mean. In addition, it is found that there are differences between men and women in their\nattitudes toward the perceived ease of use of technology and knowledge sharing, while there are no significant differences in other paths (Figures\u00a03, 4)."

(2016) \u2018s prediction that consumers voluntarily share knowledge with others in online communities. Improving vocational college students\u2019 perception of the usefulness of online learning can enhance their behavioral willingness to share knowledge with others in online learning. At the same time, it can also reduce the complexity of online learning platform operations and improve students\u2019 confidence in using online learning systems.\nThere is no significant correlation between attitudes toward knowledge sharing and knowledge sharing, which is inconsistent with the results of Fauzi et\u00a0al. (2018). Fauzi et\u00a0al. (2018) used knowledge sharing as an intermediary to determine the influencing factors of improving academic research productivity, and found that there is a significant positive correlation between attitude toward knowledge sharing and intention of knowledge sharing, and between intention of knowledge sharing and behavior of knowledge sharing. The reason may be\u00a0that attitude alone may not directly promote behavior, but also needs some external conditions to support it, such as close and frequent interaction between members and fairness of knowledge exchange.\nThere is a significant positive correlation between knowledge sharing and creativity in the online learning of vocational college students. Lee (2018) applied social technology theory and social capital theory to study the relationship between knowledge sharing and individual creativity. He\u00a0found that individual creativity can be\u00a0 improved by promoting knowledge sharing among college students. In this study, the more frequent knowledge sharing and the higher the quality of knowledge sharing in the online learning environment of vocational college students, the more students can expand their knowledge boundaries and experience, which is of great value to enhancing students\u2019 creativity.\nConfirmation significantly affects perceived usefulness, and confirmation significantly affects perceived ease of use, which is consistent with previous research results (Hong et\u00a0al., 2006; Thong\net\u00a0al., 2006; Cheng, 2020). Cheng (2020) finds that when users get ERP confirmation experience, their perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of ERP will become more specific. According to the results, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the online learning platform used to provide services, the quality of the course content, and ease of operation will affect the students to use the experience of online learning platform. If students have a positive experience using the online learning platform, the content of their learning will feel useful and easy to use.\nIn addition, the moderating effect of gender is examined. The results of the multi-group analysis showed that gender is found to mediate the relationship between perceived ease of use and knowledge-sharing attitudes, and the relationship is stronger for women. This indicates that female students tend to attach more importance to the ease of use of the system when deciding whether to adopt it or not, which is consistent with the findings of Venkatesh and Michael (2000). In this study, there is no significant difference in the influence of gender on other hypothetical relationships in the model. Meanwhile, according to the study by Baer and Kaufman (2011), men are willing to take higher risks and are curious and open to trying new things. As a result, men are more likely to be\u00a0creative (Kacmar et\u00a0al., 2011; Smith et\u00a0al., 2016). However, the findings of this study show that in the online learning situation, the predictive variables of men\u2019s and women\u2019s willingness to use the online learning system are the same, and there is no significant difference in creativity between men and women. The reason for this could be\u00a0that, in the face of severe acute infectious diseases like covid-19, traditional learning methods have been forced to change, and both men and women have shown great initiative in obtaining useful information through online learning systems, improving academic performance, and stimulating creativity.\nKnowledge sharing played a more important role in predicting online learning for women\u2019s creativity than for men\u2019s, as shown in Table\u00a014. This is because, according to the social role theory, men and women have different social expectations, which lead to\nFIGURE\u00a03 Path model result of male.\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org\ndifferent social behaviors. Men are more likely to be\u00a0 selfcontrolling and competitive, whereas women are more likely to cooperate and be\u00a0willing to socialize with others (Wang et\u00a0al., 2016). Ma and Yuen (2011) investigated gender differences in knowledge sharing in online learning environments and discovered that women are more likely to share knowledge, whereas men are less likely to share knowledge with others because they are more independent and fear social contact and connection."

Therefore, system developers can further improve the functions of online learning system, customize their own learning plans for each student, and strengthen the communication between students and teachers, so as to further stimulate students\u2019 creative ideas.\nFrom the perspective of teachers, firstly, educators should attach importance to improving students\u2019 creativity, which is critical to improving their ability to solve problems quickly and adapt to social development. Stacey (2007) points out that learning is an interdependent human activity. Our research shows that online learning environments have a positive impact on students\u2019 creativity through knowledge sharing. From this perspective, teachers can encourage students to share knowledge with others in an online learning environment. For example, teachers can help to create a free and open communication environment, encourage students to come up with creative ideas, and give students more freedom and choice in completing tasks. Secondly, teachers should pay attention to the technical characteristics of the online learning system, as prolonged use will result in user fatigue. Therefore, the duration of online courses must be\u00a0kept within a certain time frame, so that students can continue to participate without becoming bored. Finally, teachers must inform students of the potential benefits of using online learning platforms and how they can help improve their learning outcomes, emphasizing the usefulness of online learning systems to encourage students to use online learning more frequently. The learners\u2019 difficulty in operating the platform is reduced, and their willingness to use the platform is increased, by creating a guide for using the online learning platform and establishing a course assistant to provide Q & A services.\nFrom the perspective of students, the spread of the epidemic has caused anxiety, panic, fear, and a great strain on society, but people\u2019s inherent creativity can turn this difficult time into an opportunity (Fu et\u00a0al., 2022). Our results show that during the period of the outbreak, schools can cultivate vocational college students\u2019 creativity through online learning because creativity is critical to the ability to quickly solve problems in the high degree of uncertainty created by the pandemic. At the same time, creativity can help students more easily cope with stress and anxiety and can stimulate creative ideas, so as to improve the effect of learning."

An integrated model perspective provides a more complete explanation of the causal mechanism, which cannot be\u00a0obtained from a single theoretical model. By integrating TTF, TAM, and ECT models and including knowledge-sharing variables, this study reveals the impact of online learning on the creativity of students of different genders during the epidemic. A single theoretical model\ncannot explain the causal mechanism in its entirety, but an integrated model can. This is a departure from previous studies\u2019 theoretical underpinnings. When compared with earlier research, this is an entirely new approach. Prior research on individual creativity has mostly relied on theories of social and organizational capital.\nThe results show that the model has 35.1% power to explain the impact of online learning on students\u2019 creativity during the epidemic, indicating that the integration of ECM, TTF, and TAM is theoretically significant. Interestingly, perceived usefulness and attitudes toward knowledge sharing in online learning are not significant. This finding differs from that of Nguyen et\u00a0al. (2019). Nguyen et\u00a0al. (2019) integrated TAM and TPB to study the factors influencing employees\u2019 knowledge-sharing behavior in enterprises. The results show that perceived ease of use is significantly positively correlated with employees\u2019 attitudes toward knowledge sharing, and perceived usefulness is significantly positively correlated with attitudes toward knowledge sharing. In addition, perceived ease of use has an indirect impact on online knowledge-sharing attitudes through perceived usefulness. Thus, it adds new controversy to the literature on this topic: Perceived usefulness may not be\u00a0 an important factor when the research objective is knowledge-sharing attitudes in online learning.\nIn this study, there is no difference in the impact of online learning on creativity of students of different genders. As a result, it has been recognized that in times of extraordinary crisis like the pandemic, both boys and girls can use online learning as a way to stimulate creativity."

            "text": "This study combines the TTF, TAM, and ECM models, as well as the knowledge-sharing variable. Simultaneously, it investigates the moderating effect of gender and develops a research model. According to the data analysis results, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness significantly affect knowledge sharing; knowledge sharing significantly affects creativity. However, there is no significant positive correlation between perceived usefulness and attitude, and there is no significant positive correlation between attitude and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, there are gender differences in the relationship between perceived ease of use and knowledge sharing in online learning; ease of use has a greater impact on women than on men, and online learning has no effect on different students\u2019 creativity. Overall, the proposed model achieved an acceptable degree of fit and explained 35.1% of the variance, revealing that the proposed model can predict and explain the factors that affect students\u2019 creativity in online learning situations to a certain extent."

First of\nFrontiers in Psychology 16 frontiersin.org\nall, the study population only includes students from a few vocational colleges, resulting in a limited sample range, which may limit the universality of the results. A larger sample size should be\u00a0used in future studies. Second, this study tests the research model using self-reported data, which may result in deviation. This is because it is impossible to obtain completely objective data for privacy reasons. Therefore, future research should use more objective methods to test the proposed model. Third, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the creativity in the model is 35.1%, implying that the total explanatory capacity of all variables is 35.1%. In other words, with the exception of the model in this study, there is a 64.9% chance that other variables can be\u00a0added to improve the model\u2019s explanatory power."
