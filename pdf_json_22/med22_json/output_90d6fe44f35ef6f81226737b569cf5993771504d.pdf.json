It is not only conserved in mammals, but it is found in parasites, fish, and plants. Human MIF is a homotrimer with an enzymatic cavity between two subunits with Pro1 as a catalytic base, activates the receptors CD74, CXCR2, and CXCR4, has functional interactions in the cytosol, and is reported to be a nuclease. There is a solvent channel down its 3-fold axis with a recently identified gating residue as an allosteric site important for regulating, to different extents, the enzymatic activity and CD74 binding and signaling. In this study we explore the consequence of converting the allosteric residue Tyr99 to cysteine (Y99C) and characterize its crystallographic structure, NMR dynamics, stability, CD74 function, and enzymatic activity. In addition to the homotrimeric variant, we develop strategies for expressing and purifying a heterotrimeric variant consisting of mixed wild type and Y99C for characterization of the allosteric site to provide more insight.\nKeywords: macrophage migration inhibitory factor, allosteric site, mutagenesis, biophysics, biological activities\nINTRODUCTION\nMacrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in multiple non-overlapping physiological pathways (Bernhagen et al., 2007). It is expressed in cells from a variety of tissues with pronounced expression in the cells of the immune system. MIF forms a homotrimeric structure with a solvent channel coincident with its 3-fold axis and possesses three putative catalytic cavities formed at the interface between each of two adjacent subunits (Sun et al., 1996; Suzuki et al., 1996). These were first identified by the similarity of the MIF structure to two microbial enzymes that catalyzed isomerase or tautomerase reactions with a conserved and unusual N-terminal proline functioning as a catalytic base (Stivers et al., 1996a; Stivers et al., 1996b; Subramanya et al., 1996). These enzymes and MIF have 5\u201320% sequence homology but share an N-terminal proline that is evolutionarily invariant for MIF (Swope et al., 1998). The bona fide substrate for MIF has yet to be identified, but \u201cpseudosubstrates\u201d D-dopachrome and hydroxyphenylpyruvate have been useful for designing inhibitors or optimizing high throughput screens (Rosengren et al., 1996; Rosengren et al., 1997; Lubetsky et al., 2002; Cho et al., 2011). These inhibitors were used as tools to probe MIF biological activities and signaling, including functional\nEdited by: Ravi Pratap Barnwal, Panjab University, India\nReviewed by: Conrado Pedebos,\nUniversity of Oxford, United Kingdom Haiguang Liu,\nBeijing Computational Science Research Center (CSRC), China\n*Correspondence: George P.

More recently, a nuclease function was ascribed to MIF in a process known as parthanatos (Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021).\nThe mechanisms by which MIF promotes these activities are unclear, though signaling studies, biochemistry, and structures have provided some molecular details of possible mechanisms. A hypothesis that trimeric MIF functions as an enzyme at higher concentrations in the cytosol and subsequently dissociates into monomers when it is diluted in the extracellular milieu to activate\nreceptors was disproven. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments found MIF has an unusual partial volume for a protein and forms an extremely tight trimer (Philo et al., 2004). Up to four structure-based mutations at the subunit interface also failed to disrupt the homotrimer; MIF with a fifth mutation did not express or was extremely unstable (Fan et al., 2013). Despite the tight homotrimeric association of MIF, it displays remarkable dynamics by NMR (Cho et al., 2010; Crichlow et al., 2012; Pantouris et al., 2018; Pantouris et al., 2020). Recently, we discovered an allosteric regulatory site at the center of the symmetric MIF homotrimer that serves as a hub for two of its biochemical activities: the enzymatic enol-keto tautomerase and CD74 receptor activation (Pantouris et al., 2018; Pantouris et al., 2020) (Figure 1). The allosteric residues, Tyr99 from all three subunits, modulate enzymatic and CD74 receptor activation to different extents when mutated, while concurrently altering the structural and dynamic properties of the protein, as well as hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules in the central solvent channel. Notably, the size of the solvent channel opening and dynamics at the allosteric site were found to be critical diagnostics of functional outcomes, though it is still unclear exactly how the chemical properties of the allosteric site at Tyr99 or the solvent channel influence the biophysical signatures of MIF. Further insights would facilitate the rational design of site-specifically modified allosteric pathways to regulate the information flow to-and-from Tyr99, creating enhanced spatial and temporal resolution of MIF function.\nTo investigate this relationship further, we introduced a cysteine residue at position 99 (Y99C). The sulfhydryl group of Cys99 is the same molecular distance (~8 \u00c5) from the enzymatic active site as the C\u03b3 of Tyr99. We hypothesized that this mutation would enable disulfide stabilized dimers within the MIF trimers, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the structural, dynamic, and functional impact of Cys99 substitution. This method was used in a previous MIF study, when a cysteine mutation was introduced at N110 and formed an inter subunit disulfide with a Cys80 and induced changes in the oligomeric and functional properties (Fan et al., 2013). We generated a unique Y99C MIF cysteine variant, as well as a method to generate homo- and hetero-trimeric Cys proteins, and characterized their molecular structure, dynamics, and effect on enzymatic and CD74 activities using X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, biochemical assays, and in vivo experiments."

This approach is also a proof-of-principle demonstration for the engineering of novel MIF variants with structural scaffolds and activities distinct from WT MIF and homotrimeric variants. While the Y99C MIF homotrimer displays a very similar size exclusion chromatographic profile to that of WT MIF, purification of the Y99C/MIF mixed trimers, facilitated by a SNAP-tag and a His6-tag on Y99C monomeric subunits, shows distinct MIF species with differing molecular weights that can be followed by SDS-PAGE (Figures 2A,B).

Here, we find that the NMR spectrum of the Y99C homotrimer is\ndistinct from that of WT MIF, with significant chemical shift perturbations observed in residues at or near sites previously implicated in the allosteric signaling that controls MIF function (Figure 4). Chemical shift perturbations of residues at the N-terminus and proximal to His62 are consistent with prior studies of Tyr99 variants that confirmed the allosteric pathway (Tyr99-His62-Met2-Pro1) that modulates MIF enzymatic activity (Pantouris et al., 2020). We also observed significant perturbations at the C-terminus, where the CD74 receptor activation site has been mapped (Figure 4) (Pantouris et al., 2015; Pantouris et al., 2018). Comparatively, the NMR spectrum of the Y99C/WT mixed trimers reveals chemical shift perturbations in the same regions of the MIF structure as the Y99C homotrimer, though to a lesser extent. The highly symmetric WT MIF appears as a 114-residue monomer without the cleaved initiating methionine with a molecular weight of 12,388 Da protein by NMR, although it is actually a 37,164 Da trimer. While the heterozygous incorporation of mutations into MIF alters its local chemical environment, it does not perturb the global symmetry of MIF to an extent that renders its NMR spectrum more difficult to interpret (Figure 4A).

We postulated that the dynamic profile of the Y99C/WT mixed trimers would be \u201cin between\u201d that of WT MIF and the Y99C homotrimer, as was observed structurally by chemical shift perturbations of the Y99C variants (Figure 4B). Interestingly, we observe a greater overall deviation from WT-like dynamics in the Y99C/WT mixed trimers. In fact, there are limited differences in flexibility between WT MIF and the Y99C homotrimer. Only a few sites of significantly altered R1 and R2 relaxation rates for the Y99C homotrimer are observed, including Ile67, proximal to the His62 allosteric site, and Ile96 and Ala104, proximal to the Tyr99 allosteric site and the CD74 binding site (Supplementary Figure S4,5). Further, the 1H-[15N] NOE for the Y99C homotrimer reveals a slight global elevation relative to WT MIF, suggesting that the Y99C homotrimer is actually less flexible overall than WT MIF. In contrast, there is a large variance in the dynamic profile of the Y99C/WT mixed\ntrimers. Regions with altered R1 and R2 relaxation rates include residues at the monomer-monomer interface (3, 5, 32, 36, 49), residues proximal to the His62 allosteric site (63, 67), and residues near Tyr99 and the CD74 allosteric pathway (95-98, 100 102, 107, 113). The increased flexibility of the Y99C/WT mixed trimers is most apparent in the 1H-[15N] NOE, where a global depression of NOE values is observed, including significant deviations from WT MIF in functionally relevant regions of the protein similar to those observed by R1 and R2 relaxation rates.\nWe compared the dynamics of the Y99C homotrimer and Y99C/WT mixed trimers to those of WT MIF, and to each other, using correlation plots of the R1R2 relaxation rates (suggestive of \u03bcs\u2013ms molecular motions), analyzed as a product to minimize anisotropic molecular tumbling artefacts and 1H-[15N] NOEs, reporting on ps\u2013ns dynamics (Figure 5). Deviations from linearity in these plots denote substantial differences between the samples, allowing us to pinpoint specific residues affected by disruption of the allosteric site. There is a much lower correlation between the dynamic profiles of WT MIF and the Y99C/WT mixed trimers, indicating that the Y99C/WT mixed trimers exhibit altered flexibility to a much greater extent than the Y99C homotrimers, consistent with our analysis of the raw data.

Residues outside of the 1.5\u03c3 correlation boundaries, mapped onto the MIF monomer in Figure 5, highlight regions of altered flexibility suggestive of motion on multiple timescales. Most notably, we observe dynamic changes at the C-terminus and the solvent channel \u03b2-sheet, regions that allosterically mediate MIF function (Figure 4C), suggesting that the Y99C/WT mixed trimers may be functionally distinct fromWTMIF and the Y99C homotrimers. The heightened flexibility observed for the Y99C/ WTmixed trimers may be, in part, due to the heterogeneity of the Y99C/WT mixed trimers, as the subtle loss of symmetry of the heterotrimers may disrupt stabilizing interactions, despite maintaining a relatively similar overall MIF structure by NMR."

            "text": "CD74 in vivo The stimulation of neutrophil recruitment in murine lungs is tied to CD74 receptor activation in vivo (Takahashi et al., 2009). Our previous work with a Y99A variant showed significant abrogation of neutrophil recruiting activity, suggesting a coupling of this allosteric residue to the C-terminal CD74 binding site (Pantouris et al., 2018). We measured the percentage of neutrophils and total\nprotein content as biomarkers for CD74 activity and alveolarcapillary leak/pulmonary edema, respectively, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from mice sacrificed after 6 h of administration of a vehicle (saline) only or vehicle with Y99C MIF. The neutrophil influx (Supplementary Figure S5) was significantly increased in the WT MIF group (compared to controls), but significantly decreased in groups administered the Y99C homotrimeric variant, similar to Y99A (Pantouris et al., 2018). The decrease in lung inflammation is likely due to the same factor as the Y99A variant; the absence of Tyr99 and the inability of the variant to undergo correlated motions with a number of proximal and distal residues originally shown by molecular simulations (Pantouris et al., 2018). NMR studies of Y99C (Figure 4A,B, Figure 5) show perturbation in residues Ile64, Lys66, Trp108, and Asn109, which are involved in CD74 receptor binding and activation. We also cannot eliminate the two sidechain orientations of Cys99, the local changes it causes at receptor binding residues, and other residues in its proximity.\nWe previously noted that increasing the radius of the solvent channel opening by substituting Tyr99 with other residues is correlated to reduced catalytic activity (Pantouris et al., 2020). Though we observed a solvent channel opening for Y99C similar to that of Y99A, the catalytic activity of the Y99C homotrimers has reduced (55%) catalytic efficiency relative to WT MIF and\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 7836698\ncompared to Y99A (77%) (Pantouris et al., 2020) (Supplementary Figure S6). Our previous work evaluated a range of amino acid substitutions at position 99, including glycine, alanine, and phenylalanine. While the catalytic efficiencies of Y99G and Y99F were found to be 10 and 143%, respectively, compared to WT MIF, Y99A only exhibited a small decrease in catalytic activity to 77%, suggesting that amino acids with side chain sizes between the extremes of glycine and phenylalanine are less functionally predictable, and there are likely additional factors that influence activity. The catalytic efficiency of the Y99C/WT mixed trimers was predicted to be between that of the Y99C homotrimer and WT MIF, as there are fewer changes (mutations) compared to the Y99C homotrimer. Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency of the Y99C/WT mixed trimers is reduced to ~28% of WT MIF. This result may be attributed to the significant increase in flexibility observed by NMR for the Y99C/WT mixed trimers, particularly at the C-terminus near the monomer-monomer interface and in proximity to the allosteric sites on the solvent channel \u03b2-sheet, where signaling, ligand binding, and/or active site chemistry may be altered (Supplementary Figure S4,5). We observed limited differences in flexibility of WT MIF and the Y99C homotrimer, which may be a contributing factor in the higher activity of the Y99C homotrimer compared to the heterotrimeric variants. In addition to the altered dynamic profile of the Y99C/WT mixed trimers, the reduced enzymatic efficiency could be due to do the importance of symmetry at the allosteric site and its effects in catalytic activity. The use of heterotrimers was thus important to suggest symmetry is also significant at the allosteric site."

            "text": "The unexpected discovery of an allosteric site at the center of theMIF trimer has spawned protein engineering and small molecule studies aimed at modulating two non-overlapping functions of MIF from a single location. This approach highlights a strategy to make the catalytic activity, CD74 agonism and antagonism, and conformational ensemble of MIF more intuitively controllable. Mutagenesis studies employed here attempted to probe dynamics at the gating residue of the solvent channel. Engineering of an intersubunit disulfide via mutagenesis at a different residue (N110C) was used to study MIF aggregation by the compound ebselen via interaction with a natural MIF cysteine (Cys80) and the effect of a locked trimer on the catalytic and CD74 activity ofMIF (OuertataniSakouhi et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2013). The intersubunit disulfide induced global conformational changes, a higher-order oligomer, and decreased catalytic and CD74 activation (Fan et al., 2013). The X-ray structure of the Y99C MIF homotrimer did not reveal the presence of a disulfide between any two of three subunits. Interestingly, it did reveal two conformations for each thiol group (per monomer). The Y99C homotrimer abolished CD74 activation in vivo but possessed reduced enzymatic activity, supporting the role of Tyr99 as a common allosteric node within two distinct allosteric pathways. We also demonstrate in this study a proof-of-principle that MIF can be engineered to form Y99C/WT MIF heterotrimers with different structural and biophysical properties thanWTMIF or\nthe corresponding Y99C homotrimeric variant. Surprisingly, the catalytic efficiency of the mixed heterotrimeric variants was lower than Y99C. While NMR studies reveal only slight differences in the dynamics of the Y99C homotrimer and WT MIF, the Y99C/WT mixed trimers studied here exhibit heightened flexibility at critical regions of the protein, as well as the absence of symmetry compared to the Y99C homotrimer, suggesting that the slight loss in symmetry of the heterotrimers may play an important role in the altered dynamics and functional effects of the Y99C/WT mixed trimers. Future studies will attempt to isolate the heterotrimers to study their structures and dynamics individually.\nThe advance in engineering heterotrimericMIF specieswill allowus to characterize the biological activities and biophysical properties of this and other heterotrimeric mutants to provide insight into how this protein carries out its multi-functional activities. It is noteworthy that two other examples of heterotrimeric proteins exist for use as an antiinflammatory, and in the other case, as a causative agent for inflammatory disease. A strategy of structure-based design was used to convert the inflammatory homotrimeric tumor necrosis factor (TNF) protein into a heterotrimeric mutant that inactivates the native TNF via its sequestration from its two receptors (Steed et al., 2003). A disease-causing example involves more than 100 autosomal dominant mutations in the extracellular binding domain of the heterotrimeric tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) responsible for the TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS). The underlying symptoms are recurrent and prolonged episodes of fever and inflammation (Cudrici et al., 2020). The TNFR2Fc therapeutic, etanercept, has limited efficacy toward TRAPS, demonstrating that the interactions between TNF and its receptors is not the basis of the disease. This supports the reduced binding of TNF to the TNFR1 heterotrimeric T50M variant and absence of almost any binding to the C33Y and C52Fmutants, even though these receptor mutants are present on the cell surface (Todd et al., 2004). Studies initially indicated that variant-containingTNFR1heterotrimers weremostly retainedwithin the ER, resulting in ER stress in the context of inflammatory signaling and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Simon et al. 2010). Unexpectedly, the inflammation of TRAPS was not driven by the traditional unfolded protein response, but rather was mediated by enhanced generation of mitochondrial ROS (Simon et al., 2010; Bulua et al., 2011). Our studies of Y99 MIF variants serve as another example of a homotrimeric and heterotrimeric protein with unique biological effects. Heterotrimeric MIF species also provide an additional avenue for characterizing the allosteric network proposed to control the distinct functions of MIF, including the role of inter- and intra-subunit signaling."
