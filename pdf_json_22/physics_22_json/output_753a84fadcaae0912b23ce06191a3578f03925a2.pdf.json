    "abstractText": "We propose a modification of the standard linear implicit Euler integrator for the weak approximation of parabolic semilinear stochastic PDEs driven by additive space-time white noise. The new method can easily be combined with a finite difference method for the spatial discretization. The proposed method is shown to have improved qualitative properties compared with the standard method. First, for any time-step size, the spatial regularity of the solution is preserved, at all times. Second, the proposed method preserves the Gaussian invariant distribution of the infinite dimensional Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process obtained when the nonlinearity is absent, for any time-step size. The weak order of convergence of the proposed method is shown to be equal to 1{2 in a general setting, like for the standard Euler scheme. A stronger weak approximation result is obtained when considering the approximation of a Gibbs invariant distribution, when the nonlinearity is a gradient: one obtains an approximation in total variation distance of order 1{2, which does not hold for the standard method. This is the first result of this type in the literature. A key point in the analysis is the interpretation of the proposed modified Euler scheme as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to a modified stochastic evolution equation. Finally, it is shown that the proposed method can be applied to design an asymptotic preserving scheme for a class of slow-fast multiscale systems, and to construct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which is well-defined in infinite dimension. We also revisit the analysis of the standard and the accelerated exponential Euler scheme, and we prove new results with approximation in the total variation distance, which serve to illustrate the behavior of the proposed modified Euler scheme.",

Introduction\nIn the last 25 years, the numerical analysis of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) has been an active field of research. We refer for instance to the monograph [48] for a comprehensive introduction and references therein for historical overview of the field. In this article, we consider a class of parabolic semilinear equations which may be written as\n(1)\n$\n\u2019 &\n\u2019 %\nBtXpt, \u03beq \u201c B\u03be ` ap\u03beqB\u03beXpt, \u03beq \u02d8 ` fpXpt, \u03beqq ` 9W pt, \u03beq, @t \u0105 0, \u03be P p0, 1q, Xpt, 0q \u201c Xpt, 1q \u201c 0, @t \u0105 0, Xp0, \u03beq \u201c x0p\u03beq, @\u03be P p0, 1q,\n2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 60H35;65C30;60H15. Key words and phrases. Stochastic partial differential equations, Euler schemes, invariant distributions, infinite dimensional Kolmogorov equations, asymptotic preserving schemes, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.\nwhere the unknown X : pt, \u03beq P r0, T s \u02c6 r0, 1s \u00de\u00d1 Xpt, \u03beq P R is a random field, homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed, x0 is a given initial value, a : r0, 1s \u00d1 p0,8q and f : R \u00d1 R are two sufficiently smooth real-valued functions, and 9W is space-time white noise.\nIt is convenient to interpret the SPDE (1) as a stochastic evolution equation (SEE) in the sense of [33]\n(2) dXptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bXptqdt ` F pXptqqdt ` dW ptq, Xp0q \u201c x0,\nwhere the unknown X : t P r0, T s \u00de\u00d1 Xptq P L2p0, 1q is a continuous stochastic process with values in the infinite dimensional Hilbert space H \u201c L2p0, 1q. The nonlinearity F : H \u00d1 H is assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous. See Section 2 for details, in particular for the definition and properties of the linear operator \u039b. The SEE (2) is driven by a cylindrical Wiener process. In the sequel, we only deal with SEEs of type (2).\nTo approximate solutions of SPDEs (1) and SEEs (2), it is necessary to apply spatial and temporal discretization procedures. On the one hand, the spatial approximation may be performed using either a spectral Galerkin method or a finite differences scheme. To employ the spectral Galerkin technique, one needs to know the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the linear operator \u039b, which is not the case in general (in the case of (1), this is the case if the function a is constant). The finite differences scheme can be applied in greater generality, therefore this is the method which is chosen in this work. On the other hand, the temporal approximation may be performed for instance using a standard semi-implicit Euler integrator, or an exponential integrator. The application of the exponential Euler scheme also requires to know the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the linear operator \u039b (or of its spatial approximation using a finite difference method), which is not the case in general. In this work, we study a variant of the standard Euler scheme. Note that the exponential Euler integrator is also treated as a matter of comparison for the proposed method.\nInstead of considering a fully discrete scheme, which combines a finite differences scheme and a (modification of the) standard Euler scheme, in this work we analyze only the temporal discretization. Results may be generalized to the fully discrete framework, with the introduction of additional notation, and qualitative properties and quantitative error estimates being uniform with respect to the spatial discretization parameter. Focusing only on the temporal approximation allows us to emphasize how the proposed method overcomes some limitations of the standard scheme. In the sequel, the spatial discretization is thus omitted in the statements and in the proofs.\nThe standard Euler scheme applied to the SEE (2) reads\n(3) X\u03c4,stn`1 \u201c pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 \u00b4 X\u03c4,stn ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4,stn q ` W ptn`1q \u00b4 W ptnq \u00af ,\nwith initial value X\u03c4,s0 \u201c x0, where the time-step size is denoted by \u03c4 and tn \u201c n\u03c4 . In practice, if a finite difference method is applied for spatial discretization, note that it is sufficient to solve linear systems using a LU decomposition of the resulting linear operator. The standard linear implicit Euler scheme (3) has been studied extensively in the literature, let us recall that\n\u201a it has strong order of convergence 1{4, see for instance [51], \u201a it has weak order of convergence 1{2, see for instance [34],\n\u201a when the Lipschitz constant of F is sufficiently small, the invariant distribution of the SEE is approximated with order of convergence 1{2, see for instance [12].\nHowever, the standard Euler scheme (3) suffers from a major issue: the spatial regularity of the solution is not preserved, more precisely for any fixed value of the time-step size \u03c4 and any integer n P N, the random variable X\u03c4,stn is more regular than Xptnq, when the regularity is measured either in the sense of H\u00f6lder or Sobolev spaces. Furthermore, this difference in the qualitative behavior of the exact and numerical solution has an impact on quantitative error estimates. Indeed, as shown in [13], one needs to consider test functions which are at least of class C2 to obtain a weak order of convergence 1{2. The distributions of the H-valued random variables X\u03c4,stn and Xptnq are singular, and therefore the distribution of Xptnq cannot be approximated in the total variation distance sense using the approximation X\u03c4,stn obtained using the standard Euler scheme."

            "text": "The modified Euler scheme. The objective of this work is to introduce a modified Euler scheme, which can be easily combined with a finite differences method for the spatial approximation, and which overcomes the limitations of the standard Euler scheme mentioned above. The proposed modified Euler scheme is defined as follows:\n(4) X\u03c4n`1 \u201c A\u03c4 ` X\u03c4n ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4nq \u02d8 ` B\u03c4,1 ? \u03c4\u0393n,1 ` B\u03c4,2 ? \u03c4\u0393n,2,\nwhere ` \u0393n,1 \u02d8 n\u011b0 and ` \u0393n,2 \u02d8\nn\u011b0 are two independent sequences of equally distributed independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables, meaning that in distribution \u0393n,1 \u201c \u0393n,2 \u201c \u03c4\u00b4 1 2 ` W ptn`1q \u00b4 W ptnq \u02d8\nare rescaled increments of the cylindrical Wiener process. The definition of the modified Euler scheme (4) requires the introduction of three linear operators A\u03c4 , B\u03c4,1 and B\u03c4,2: they are required to satisfy the conditions (see (30) in Section 3.1)\n(5) A\u03c4 \u201c pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 , B\u03c4,1 \u201c 1? 2 pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 , B\u03c4,2B\u2039\u03c4,2 \u201c 1 2 pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 where L\u2039 denotes the adjoint of a linear operator L. It is worth mentioning that the modified Euler scheme (4) can be seen as a modification of the standard Euler scheme (3), with a different treatment of the stochastic term, but the same treatment of the linear operator \u039b and of the nonlinear operator F . Furthermore, the linear operator B\u03c4,2 is not determined uniquely by the third condition (5): in particular, it is not required to be a self-adjoint operator, instead in practice, when a finite differences method is applied, it is sufficient to compute a Cholesky decomposition of the resulting linear operator. Note that the iterations in the modified Euler scheme (4) have higher computational cost than the iterations in the standard scheme (3). In addition, two cylindrical Gaussian random variables are needed at each iteration of the modified Euler scheme (4), instead of one for the standard Euler scheme (3). The conditions appearing in (5) are justified in Section 3 and are designed to improve the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the standard scheme, as explained below. Note that the standard Euler scheme (3) can be written in a form similar to (4) and would be recovered by setting B\u03c4,2,st \u201c B\u03c4,1 (the definitions of A\u03c4 and B\u03c4,1 being unchanged). In other words, the condition\nB\u03c4,2,stB \u2039 \u03c4,2,st \u201c\n1 2 pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b42 \u201c 1 2 A2\u03c4\nwould be satisfied for the standard Euler scheme instead of the third condition\nB\u03c4,2B \u2039 \u03c4,2 \u201c\n1 2 pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 \u201c 1 2 A\u03c4\nfrom (5) for the modified Euler scheme. This observation that the powers of the operator A\u03c4 differ in the conditions for B\u03c4,2 and B\u03c4,2,st is crucial to understand how the modified Euler scheme overcomes the limitations of the standard Euler scheme mentioned above.\nMain qualitative and quantitative results. We are now in position to state and discuss the main results of this manuscript. We refer to Section 2 for precise assumptions on the linear operator \u039b and the nonlinearity F , and to Section 4 for rigorous statements of the results. Let us first discuss the qualitative behavior of the modified Euler scheme (4). The main result in this direction is the following: for any time-step size \u03c4 and any n P N, if F \u201c 0, the distributions of the H-valued random variables X\u03c4n and Xptnq are equivalent, see Theorem 4.1. This result is proved using the Feldman-Hajeck criterion. As a consequence, one then checks that the spatial regularity of the numerical solution X\u03c4n and of the exact solution Xptnq coincide, see Theorem 4.2. The proof is straightforward, since the spatial regularity is determined by the behavior of the stochastic contribution, not by the initial value or the nonlinearity, in the considered framework.\nIn order to illustrate the qualitative superiority of the modified Euler scheme (4) over the standard Euler scheme (3), let us provide a numerical experiment. The SPDE (2), with a \u201c 1 and f \u201c 0, is approximated using a finite difference method with mesh size h \u201c 10\u00b43. The time-step size is chosen as \u03c4 \u201c 2\u00b48. The final time is set to T \u201c 1. Figure 1 (fixed time T \u201c 1) and Figure 2 (all times tn P r0, 1s) illustrate the preservation of the regularity property (Theorem 4.2) for the modified Euler scheme (left figure), compared with the higher regularity obtained when using the standard Euler scheme (right figure). The realizations are sampled using the same Wiener path: this means that the Gaussian random variables satisfy the equality \u0393n,1 ` \u0393n,2 \u201c ? 2\u0393n for all n \u011b 0.\nFor quantitative weak error estimates, two results are stated. The main and most original result of this manuscript is Theorem 4.4. Assume that the mapping satisfies the gradient assumption F \u201c \u00b4DV where V : H \u00d1 R is a given real-valued function and D denotes the Fr\u00e9chet derivative. To ensure ergodicity of the SEE (2), assume that the Lipschitz constant of F is sufficiently small (see Assumption 3 below), then the SEE (2) admits a unique invariant\ndistribution, which is the Gibbs distribution\nd\u00b5\u2039pxq \u201c Z\u00b41 exp ` \u00b42V pxq \u02d8 d\u03bdpxq where \u03bd is the centered Gaussian distribution with covariance operator 1\n2 \u039b\u00b41, and Z is a\nnormalization constant. Under the same assumptions, for any time-step size \u03c4 , the modified Euler scheme (4) admits a unique invariant distribution \u00b5\u03c48, and one has the following approximation result (see Theorem 4.4)\ndTVp\u00b5\u03c48, \u00b5\u2039q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4\nwhere \u03b4 P p0, 1 2 q is an arbitrarily small parameter, C\u03b4 P p0,8q, and dTV denotes the total variation distance. In other words, one has weak error estimates \u02c7\n\u02c7\n\u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c48 \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4~\u03d5~\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4\nwhere the test functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R only need to be assumed measurable and bounded and ~\u03d5~ \u201c sup\nxPH |\u03d5pxq|.\nIn addition, when F \u201c 0, then \u00b5\u03c48 \u201c \u03bd for any time-step size \u03c4 : the Gaussian invariant distribution is preserved in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck case when using the modified Euler scheme.\nLet us mention that the main ingredient for the proof of Theorem 4.4 is the interpretation of the modified Euler scheme as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to the modified stochastic evolution equation\n(6) dX\u03c4 ptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4X\u03c4 ptqdt ` Q\u03c4F pX\u03c4ptqqdt ` Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW ptq, X\u03c4 p0q \u201c x0,\nwhich depends on two auxiliary linear operators \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 : we refer to Section 3.3 for their definitions. Precisely, for any time-step size \u03c4 and any integer n \u011b 0, one has equality in distribution X\u03c4n \u201c X\u03c4,n, where the sequence ` X\u03c4,n \u02d8 n\u011b0 is defined by (7) X\u03c4,n`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4X\u03c4,n ` \u039b\u00b41\u03c4 pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 qQ\u03c4F pX\u03c4,nq ` \u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW psq\nwith initial value X\u03c4,0 \u201c x0. It is crucial to observe that, when the gradient condition F \u201c \u00b4DV is satisfied, the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039 is the invariant distribution of the modified SEE (6), for any value of the time-step size \u03c4 . Other technical assumptions and results are\nneeded to obtain Theorem 4.4, we refer to Sections 4.2 and 6.1, in particular to see why the interpretation as an accelerated exponential Euler scheme is helpful to reduce the regularity requirements on the test functions \u03d5 to prove weak error estimates.\nWhen the gradient condition F \u201c \u00b4DV is not satisfied, the SEE (2) admits a unique invariant distribution \u00b58, which has no known expression in general. Theorem 4.9 provides weak error estimates\n\u02c7 \u02c7\n\u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c48 \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b58 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4~\u03d5~2\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4\nfor test functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R which are assumed to be of class C2 with bounded second order derivatives. This result is similar to the one proved in [12] for the standard Euler scheme. In addition, for any time T P p0,8q, in a general setting, one has weak error estimates\n\u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4pT, x0q~\u03d5~2\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4,\nwith T \u201c N\u03c4 , for test functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R which are assumed to be of class C2 with bounded second order derivatives, see Theorem 4.8. Like above, this result is similar to the one obtaind in [34] for the standard Euler scheme. Even if Theorems 4.8 and 4.9 do not show improvements for the modified Euler scheme compared with the standard Euler method, it is worth providing detailed proofs to justify that the modified Euler scheme is not meant to be used only for the approximation of the Gibbs invariant distribution, which would be restrictive. Note that whether the regularity requirement on the test functions \u03d5 may be weakened in Theorems 4.8 and 4.9 is an open question.\nThe main result, Theorem 4.4, is compared with the results which are obtained for the standard Euler scheme (3) in Section 4.4, and for the accelerated exponential Euler scheme in Section 4.5.\nOn the one hand, when F \u201c 0, the invariant distribution of the standard Euler scheme (3) is a Gaussian distribution \u03bd\u03c4 . It is straightforward to check that \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd are singular probability distribution for all \u03c4 \u0105 0, this may be seen as a result of the non preservation of the spatial regularity by the standard Euler method. Using an interpretation of the standard Euler scheme as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to a modified stochastic evolution equation, one proves an approximation result\ndTVp\u00b5\u03c48, \u00b5\u03c4\u2039q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4,\nin the total variation distance, see Theorem 4.11, when the nonlinearity satisfies the gradient condition F \u201c \u00b4DV . The main difference with Theorem 4.4 is the fact that \u00b5\u03c4\u2039 is not equal to the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039, instead it is a Gibbs distribution d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039pxq \u201c pZ\u03c4 q\u00b41e\u00b42V pxqd\u03bd\u03c4 pxq where the reference measure is the Gaussian distribution \u03bd\u03c4 . Theorem 4.11 may not be useful in practice when using the standard Euler scheme since \u00b5\u03c4\u2039 and \u00b5\u2039 are singular probability distributions. However, from a theoretical perspective, this result shows again that the limitations in the performances of the standard Euler scheme are due to the discretization of the stochastic part only. The proof of Theorem 4.11, given in Section 8, employs the same techniques as the proof of Theorem 4.4, and a few more delicate arguments.\nOn the other hand, let us consider the accelerated exponential Euler scheme, defined by\n(8) X\u03c4,en`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039bX\u03c4,en ` \u039b\u00b41pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039bqF pX\u03c4,en q ` \u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039bdW psq, X\u03c4,e0 \u201c x0.\nNote that if F \u201c 0, then X\u03c4,en \u201c Xptnq for any time-step size \u03c4 and any integer n \u011b 0: the discretization in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck case using the accelerated exponential Euler scheme is exact. As a result, it is not a surprising result that the spatial regularity is preserved when using that scheme. More interestingly, Theorem 4.12 states that one can approximate the distribution of Xptnq in the total variation distance, at any time and without the requirement that the nonlinearity F satisfies the gradient condition:\n\u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,eN qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4pT, x0q~\u03d5~0\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4,\nwith T \u201c N\u03c4 , where the test functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R only need to be assumed measurable and bounded. Theorem 4.13 states a result for the approximation of the invariant distribution \u00b58 of the SEE (2),\ndTVp\u00b5\u03c4,e8 , \u00b58q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4,\nwhere \u00b5\u03c4,e8 is the unique invariant distribution of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme (8) with time-step size \u03c4 . Compared with the accelerated exponential Euler scheme, approximation results in the total variation distance are obtained for the proposed modified Euler scheme (4) in a more restrictive setting, namely for the approximation of the Gibbs invariant distribution when the gradient condition F \u201c \u00b4DV is satisfied by the nonlinearity. However, the range of application of the modified Euler scheme is larger, since it does not require to known the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the linear operator \u039b. Theorems 4.12 and 4.13 are new results on the accelerated exponential Euler scheme. The proof of Theorem 4.12 exhibits the main arguments which are needed in the proof of the main result, Theorem 4.4, and in particular why it is convenient and crucial to interpret the modified Euler scheme (4) as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to the modified stochastic evolution equation (6), as explained above.\nTwo applications of the modified Euler scheme. The last two main contributions of this manuscript are two applications of the modified Euler scheme, which again illustrate its superiority compared with the standard Euler method. First, in Section 9.1, we study a class of slow-fast stochastic evolution systems\n(9)\n$\n&\n%\ndX\u01ebptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bX\u01ebptqdt ` G ` X \u01ebptq,Y\u01ebptq \u02d8\ndY\u01ebptq \u201c \u00b41 \u01eb \u039bY\u01ebptqdt ` \u03c3pX \u01ebptqq? \u01eb dW ptq,\ndepending on a time scale separation parameter \u01eb, where G : H\u02c6H \u00d1 H and \u03c3 : H \u00d1 R are bounded and globally Lipschitz continuous mappings.

Using the modified Euler scheme to discretize the fast component,\nwe design an asymptotic preserving scheme\n(10)\n$\n\u2019 &\n\u2019 %\nX \u01eb,\u03c4 n`1 \u201c A\u03c4\n`\nX \u01eb,\u03c4 n ` \u03c4GpX\u01eb,\u03c4n ,Y\u01eb,\u03c4n`1q\n\u02d8\nY \u01eb,\u03c4 n`1 \u201c A \u03c4\u01eb Y \u01eb,\u03c4 n ` \u03c3pX\u01eb,\u03c4n q\nc\n\u03c4 \u01eb B \u03c4 \u01eb ,1\u0393n,1 ` \u03c3pX\u01eb,\u03c4n q\nc\n\u03c4 \u01eb B \u03c4 \u01eb ,2\u0393n,2.\nFirst, it is shown that there exists a limiting scheme, X\u01eb,\u03c4n \u00d1 \u01eb\u00d10 X 0,\u03c4 0 for any time-step size \u03c4 and any integer \u03c4 , where the convergence is understood as convergence in distribution. Second, it is shown that the limiting scheme, given by\nX 0,\u03c4 n`1 \u201c A\u03c4\n`\nX 0,\u03c4 n ` \u03c4GpX0,\u03c4n , \u03c3pX0,\u03c4b qQ 1 2\u0393nq \u02d8 ,\nsatisfies X0,\u03c4N \u00d1 \u03c4\u00d10 XpT q, with T \u201c N\u03c4 , where the convergence is understood as convergence in distribution. Since for any fixed \u01eb, one also has X\u01eb,\u03c4N \u00d1\n\u03c4\u00d10 X \u01ebpT q, the proposed scheme (10) satisfies the asymptotic preserving property, and the time-step size \u03c4 can be chosen independently of the time scale separation parameter \u01eb. Note that if the fast component Y\u01eb of the system (9) is discretized using the standard Euler scheme, the resulting limiting scheme is not consistent with the limiting equation given by the averaging principle. After proving that the scheme (10) is asymptotic preserving, it is natural to investigate whether the scheme is uniformly accurate: we refer to [9] for the proof of uniform weak error estimates.\nSecond, in Section 9.2, another application of the modified Euler scheme is presented: it can be employed as a proposal kernel to apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, based on the Metropolis\u2013Hastings rule for the computation of the acceptance-rejection probability, where the target probability distribution is the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039. Theorem 9.3 states that for any value of the time-step size \u03c4 , the Markov chain defined by\n(11)\n#\nX\u0302 \u03c4 n`1 \u201c A\u03c4X\u03c4n ` ? \u03c4B\u03c4,1\u0393n,1 ` ? \u03c4B\u03c4,2\u0393n,2\nX \u03c4 n`1 \u201c 1Un\u010fapX\u03c4n,X\u0302\u03c4n`1qX\u0302 \u03c4 n`1 ` 1Un\u0105apX\u03c4n,X\u0302\u03c4n`1qX \u03c4 n,\nwhere Un is a uniformly distributed random variable (independent of the cylindrical Gaussian random variables \u0393n,1 and \u0393n,2), and the acceptance-rejection ratio is defined by\n(12) apx, x\u0302q \u201c minp1, e2pV pxq\u00b4V px\u0302qqq is ergodic, with unique invariant distribution \u00b5\u2039. In addition, the convergence is exponentially fast. This result would not hold if the standard Euler scheme was used to define the proposal kernel.\nComparison with the literature. Let us now review the relevant literature in order to illustrate the novelties of this work. We refer to the monograph [48] for an introduction to computational methods for SPDEs. We also refer to the monograph [47] for a presentation of approximation results for parabolic semilinear SEEs of type (2), with a focus on the standard Euler scheme for the temporal discretization and on finite element methods for the spectral discretization.\nThe standard Euler scheme used to discretize the SPDE (1) (combined with a finite difference method) has been studied by many authors: see for instance [38, 37]. When the problem is interpreted as a SEE (2) (which is the point of view considered in this work), the strong and weak orders of convergence of the standard Euler scheme have been identified\nin [51] and [35, 34] respectively. Theorem 4.8, in particular, is proved using tools similar to those introduced in [34] for the weak error analysis: analysis of regularity properties for solutions of infinite dimensional Kolmogorov equations (see Sections 5.6 and 5.4) and Malliavin calculus techniques. However, details are different since the proof of Theorem 4.8 is based on an original point of view introduced in this article, namely the interpretation of the modified Euler scheme as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme for the modified SEE (6). For regularity results on infinite dimensional Kolmogorov equations, we refer to the monograph [24] and to [2]. For other weak approximation results using similar techniques, we refer for instance to [4] (finite element approximation), to [15] (standard Euler scheme in the multiplicative noise case) or to [53]. Other strategies are used to prove weak error results for instance in [3], in [28, 46] or in [19]. The accelerated exponential Euler scheme has been introduced and studied in [45, 44]. Weak convergence results for this method have been proved in [52].\nAll the works mentioned above deal with SPDEs (1) and SEEs (2) under the assumption that the nonlinearity F is globally Lipschitz continuous. In the last decade, there has been a huge interest in the approximation of problems with locally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities: this class encompasses for instance the Allen\u2013Cahn equation. We refer to [18, 30, 23] for weak convergence results. In this work, we only focus on the globally Lipschitz continuous case, see Section 9 for a discussion on possible generalization to the locally Lipschitz continuous case.\nConcerning the approximation of invariant distributions of SEEs (2), under appropriate conditions ensuring ergodicity [32], Theorem 4.9 is a variant of the results obtained in [12] and [20] for the standard Euler scheme and finite element approximation. In [20], the error analysis is performed using regularity properties of solutions of infinite dimensional Poisson equations. In [22], a postprocessed version of the standard Euler scheme has been introduced, with the objective to increase the order of convergence of the approximation of the invariant distribution. There are similarities between the method proposed in [22] and the modified Euler scheme (4), see Remark 3.5 for details: the two methods preserve the Gaussian distribution \u03bd in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck case (F \u201c 0), however [22] does not provide error estimates (with higher weak order of convergence) for general nonlinearities F . When the gradient condition F \u201c \u00b4DV is satisfied, higher-order schemes for the approximation of the invariant Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039 can be designed using a preconditioning technique, possibly combined with the postprocessing approach, see [16] (see also [42, 41]). For parabolic semilinear SEEs (2) with non-globally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities F , we refer to the recent articles [14, 31, 27], and to [17] for the application of the preconditioning technique in this case. We refer also to the monograph [43] and references therein for the analysis of this question for some stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equations. Results on the approximation of the invariant distribution for viscous stochastic conservation laws are provided in [8]. Let us emphasize that all the weak convergence results mentioned above on the approximation of the invariant distribution require test functions which are at least of class C2.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Theorems 4.4, 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 are the first results in the literature giving an approximation in the total variation distance for numerical approximation of stochastic evolution equations (2). The modified Euler scheme therefore overcomes the limitations identified in [13] for the standard Euler scheme, when considering the approximation of the Gibbs invariant distribution. In the finite dimensional case, this type\nof result has been proved in the seminal works [5], [6]. The recent preprint [26] studies a related question for the stochastic partial differential equation: the authors prove an approximation result for the density of the real-valued random variables Xpt, \u03beq solving (1) for given t P p0,8q and \u03be P p0, 1q, when using the accelerated exponential Euler scheme. However, considering real-valued Gaussian random variables Xpt, \u03beq and H-valued Gaussian random variables Xptq is a very different matter.\nLet us finally discuss how the two applications of the modified Euler scheme mentioned above are related to the literature. On the one hand, the analysis of the asymptotic preserving scheme (10) for the multiscale system (9) is a generalization in an infinite dimensional framework of the recent work [21], where the notion of AP schemes for a class of stochastic differential equations has been introduced. The averaging principle (convergence of X\u01eb to X when \u01eb \u00d1 0) has been studied by many authors, we refer to [25] for the convergence and to [10] for weak error estimates. Instead of using the Heterogeneous Multiscale Method like in [11], the AP scheme (10) also provides an accurate approximation when \u01eb is not assumed to be small. However, the construction of the AP scheme (10) is limited to a fast process which solves an Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck dynamics. Compared with [21], in this work we only prove that the scheme is asymptotic preserving and do not investigate whether the scheme is uniformly accurate. We refer to [9] for the proof of uniform weak error estimates for the AP scheme (10) applied to the multiscale system (9) (when \u03c3 is constant). On the other hand, in order to sample the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been constructed using the preconditioned Crank\u2013Nicolson (pCN) as the proposal kernel. In [29], it is proved that applying a proposal kernel using the theta-method with \u03b8 \u2030 1{2 applied to a preconditioned Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck dynamics (which preserves the Gaussian invariant distribution \u03bd) leads to a method which is ill-defined in infinite dimension. It is proved in [40] that the pCN proposal kernel provides a MCMC sampler which has a spectral gap which is independent of dimension, using the techniques introduced in [39]. The performance of the pCN MCMC sampler is also analyzed in [49] using the point of view of diffusion limits. In this article, we design a new MCMC sampler (11)\u2013(12) where the proposal kernel is the modified Euler scheme, and Theorem 9.3 is proved following the approach of [40]. Our analysis only justifies that the proposed MCMC method is well-defined and applicable, however it does not provide information to choose the auxiliary time-step size \u03c4 in an optimal way. In addition, comparing the performances of the different MCMC samplers is out of scope of this work.\nOrganization of the manuscript. This manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the necessary notation and assumptions. The modified Euler scheme is introduced in Section 3. Equivalent formulations of the modified Euler scheme are given in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. The main results are stated in Section 4. First, qualitative properties (preservation of the spatial regularity and of the Gaussian invariant distribution in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck case) are studied in Section 4.1. Second, Section 4.2 is devoted to the major result of this article, Theorem 4.4, which gives approximation in the total variation distance with order 1{2 of the Gibbs invariant distribution \u00b5\u2039 when the nonlinearity F is a gradient \u00b4DV . Third, Section 4.3 provides Theorem 4.8, which states that the weak order of convergence of the method is equal to 1{2 (for sufficiently smooth test functions) in a general setting. Finally, Sections 4.4 and 4.5 are devoted to comparing the modified Euler scheme with the standard Euler method and the accelerated exponential Euler method respectively. Auxiliary results\nare stated and proved in Section 5. In particular, regularity results for solutions of infinite dimensional Kolmogorov equations are given in Sections 5.4 and 5.6. Section 6 is devoted to proving first Theorem 4.4, second Theorem 4.8. Sections 8 and 7 contain the proofs of the results given in Sections 4.4 (standard Euler scheme) and 4.5 (accelerated exponential Euler scheme) respectively. Finally, Section 9 provides two applications of the modified Euler scheme. First, an asymptotic preserving scheme is introduced for a class of systems with two time scales, in a regime governed by the averaging principle. Second, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler which is well-defined and has a spectral gap in infinite dimension (Section 9.2, Theorem 9.3) is studied. Moroever, the generalization of the proposed modified Euler scheme for other types of parabolic semilinear SPDEs is discussed in Section 9.3.\n2. Setting\nThis section is organized as follows. General notation is first introduced in Section 2.1. Sections 2.2 and 2.3 then provide the abstract conditions on the linear and nonlinear operators \u039b and F respectively. Examples operators satisfying the abstract conditions are described in Section 2.4. Some properties of the stochastic evolution equation are provided in Section 2.5. Section 2.6 deals with the invariant distribution of the stochastic evolution equation. Finally Section 2.7 presents an auxiliary approximation procedure which is used implicitly in the sequel.\n2.1. Notation. Let us first introduce general notation. The set of integers is denoted by N \u201c t1, 2, . . .u, and N0 \u201c t0u Y N. In the sequel, the values of positive real numbers C P p0,8q may change from line to line.\nThe time-step size of the numerical schemes is denoted by \u03c4 . For all n P N0, let tn \u201c n\u03c4 . The moment and error estimates below are stated for values \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, where \u03c40 is an arbitrary positive real number, and without loss of generality one may assume that \u03c40 \u0103 1. The values of constants C are allowed to depend on \u03c40, but they are independent of \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. If t1, t2 \u011b 0, set t1 ^ t2 \u201c minpt1, t2q.\nThe state space is a separable Hilbert space H , equipped with inner product and norm denoted by x\u00a8, \u00a8y and | \u00a8 | respectively. The set of bounded linear operators from H to H is denoted by LpHq, which is a Banach space with the norm } \u00a8 }LpHq defined by\n}L}LpHq \u201c sup xPHzt0u |Lx| |x| .\nIn addition, L2pHq \u0102 LpHq denotes the set of Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operators from H to H . The set L2pHq is an Hilbert space, with the norm } \u00a8 }L2pHq defined by\n}L}2 L2pHq \u201c\n\u00ff jPN |Lej |2,\nwhere `\nej\n\u02d8\njPN is an arbitrary complete orthonormal system of H .\nThe random variables and the stochastic processes considered in this article are defined on a probability space denoted by p\u2126,F ,Pq. This probability space is equipped with a filtration ` Ft \u02d8\nt\u011b0 which is assumed to satisfy the usual conditions. The expectation operator\nis denoted by Er\u00a8s.\nLet ` \u03b2j \u02d8\njPN denote a sequence of independent standard real-valued Wiener processes,\nadapted to the filtration ` Ft \u02d8 t\u011b0. This means in particular that for each j P N, ` \u03b2jptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 is a Gaussian process, such that one has \u03b2jp0q \u201c 0, Er\u03b2jptqs \u201c 0 for all t \u011b 0 and Er|\u03b2jpt2q \u00b4 \u03b2jpt1q|2s \u201c t2 \u00b4 t1 for all t2 \u011b t1 \u011b 0.\nThe cylindrical Wiener process ` W ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 on H is formally defined as\n(13) W ptq \u201c \u00ff\njPN \u03b2jptqej\nwhere `\nej\n\u02d8\njPN is an arbitrary complete orthonormal system of H . Recall that if L P L2pHq, `\nLW ptq \u02d8 t \u011b 0 is a well-defined Gaussian process, with Er|LW ptq|2s \u201c }L}2 L2pHqt. However,\n` W ptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 does not take values in H : for all t \u0105 0, Er|W ptq|2s \u201c 8, and even |W ptq| \u201c 8 almost surely. We refer to [33, Chapter 4] for a description of the cylindrical Wiener processes and of the related theory of stochastic integration in Hilbert spaces. Let us recall a version of the It\u00f4 isometry formula in this setting: if \u03a6 : t P r0, T s \u00de\u00d1 \u03a6ptq P L2pHq is a continuous deterministic mapping, the random variable\n\u017c T\n0\n\u03a6ptqdW ptq \u201c \u00ff\njPN\n\u017c T\n0\n\u03a6ptqejd\u03b2jptq\nis a centered H-valued Gaussian random variable, with\nEr| \u017c T\n0\n\u03a6ptqdW ptq|2s \u201c \u017c T\n0\n}\u03a6ptq}2L2pHqdt \u201c \u00ff\njPN\n\u017c T\n0\n|\u03a6ptqej |2dt.\nOne of the proofs below requires tools from Malliavin calculus [50]. We do not give precise definitions, instead let us state the notation used in this article and quote the most useful results. If \u0398 is an H-valued random variable, Dhs\u0398 P H is the Malliavin derivative of \u0398 at time s in direction h P H . For instance, this means that\nDhs `\n\u017c T\n0\nLptqdW ptq \u02d8 \u201c Lpsqh\nif t P r0, T s \u00de\u00d1 Lptq P LpHq is an adapted process. In addition, if \u0398 is Ft-measurable, then Dhs\u0398 \u201c 0 for all s \u0105 t. The Malliavin derivative satisfies a chain rule property: if \u03a6 : H \u00d1 H is of class C1 with bounded derivative, then for all s \u011b 0 and h P H one has\nDhs\u03c6p\u0398q \u201c D\u03c6p\u0398q.Dhs\u0398.\nThe same type of notation and results are satisfied for R-valued random variables \u03b8. Finally, one has the following integration by parts formula, which is essential for the proof of weak error estimates, see [34]: if \u03b8 is R-valued random variable and if pt, sq \u00de\u00d1 \u03c6pt, sq P R is a given deterministic function, for all j P N, one has\n(14) E \u201c \u03b8\n\u017c t\n0\n\u03c6pt, sqd\u03b2jpsq \u2030 \u201c \u017c t\n0\nErDejs \u03b8\u03c6pt, sqd\u03b2jpsqs.\nIn addition, introduce the following notation.

Similarly, ~\u03d5~1 \u0103 8 and ~\u03d5~2 \u0103 8 when \u03d5 has a bounded first order derivative, respectively a bounded second order derivative.\nThe set of bounded and measurable mappings from H to R is denoted by BbpHq. For any \u03d5 P BbpHq, set\n~\u03d5~ \u201c sup xPH |\u03d5pxq|.\nThe total variation distance between two Borel probability distributions \u00b51 and \u00b52 defined on H is defined by\ndTVp\u00b51, \u00b52q \u201c sup \u03d5PBbpHq,\u03d5\u20300\n\u02c7 \u02c7 \u015f \u03d5d\u00b51 \u00b4 \u015f \u03d5d\u00b52 \u02c7 \u02c7\n~\u03d5~ .\nIntroduce also distances d0 and d1 defined by\nd0p\u00b51, \u00b52q \u201c sup \u03d5PC0pHq,\u03d5\u20300\n\u02c7 \u02c7 \u015f \u03d5d\u00b51 \u00b4 \u015f \u03d5d\u00b52 \u02c7 \u02c7\n~\u03d5~0\nd2p\u00b51, \u00b52q \u201c sup \u03d5PC2pHq,\u03d5\u20300\n\u02c7 \u02c7 \u015f \u03d5d\u00b51 \u00b4 \u015f \u03d5d\u00b52 \u02c7 \u02c7\n~\u03d5~0 ` ~\u03d5~1 ` ~\u03d5~2 .\nObserve that the inequality d2p\u00b51, \u00b52q \u010f d0p\u00b51, \u00b52q holds. Recall (see for instance [36, Chapter 3,Section 4]) that for any bounded and measurable function \u03d5 P BbpHq, there exists a sequence ` \u03d5k \u02d8\nkPN of bounded and continuous functions which converges boundedly and pointwise to \u03d5, i. e. which satisfies sup\nkPN ~\u03d5k~ \u0103 8 and \u03d5kpxq \u00d1 k\u00d18 \u03d5pxq for all x P H .

Assumptions on the linear operator. The stochastic evolution equation (2) is driven by an unbounded self-adjoint linear operator \u00b4\u039b : Dp\u039bq \u0102 H \u00d1 H , which is assumed to satisfy the following conditions.\nAssumption 1.

For all \u03b1 P r0, 1s, introduce the notation\n|x|\u03b1 \u201c `\n\u00ff jPN \u03bb2\u03b1j xx, ejy2 \u02d8 1 2 P r0,8s,\nthen \u039b\u03b1 is an unbounded self-adjoint linear operator with domain Dp\u039b\u03b1q \u201c H\u03b1, defined by H\u03b1 \u201c tx P H ; |x|\u03b1 \u0103 8u.\nThe definition of \u039b\u03b1 when \u03b1 \u201c 1 coincides with the definition of \u039b. When \u03b1 \u201c 0, \u039b0 is the identity operator denoted by I, and | \u00a8 |0 \u201c |\u00a8 | is the usual norm in the Hilbert space H . Note that for all \u00b41 \u010f \u03b11 \u010f \u03b12 \u010f 1, there exists C\u03b11,\u03b12 P p0,8q such that |\u039b\u03b11x| \u010f C\u03b11,\u03b12 |\u039b\u03b12x| for all x P Dp\u039b\u03b12q.\nOne of the main ingredients used in the analysis below is the following smoothing property: for all \u03b1 P r0, 1s, one has (16) sup\ntPp0,8q t\u03b1}\u039b\u03b1e\u00b4t\u039b}LpHq \u0103 8.\nThe smoothing property (16) is often used in the following form in the sequel:\n|e\u00b4t\u039bx| \u010f C\u03b1t\u00b4\u03b1|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1x| for all t P p0,8q and x P H .\nIn addition, the following property is satisfied: for all \u03b1 P r0, 1s, one has\n(17) sup tPp0,8q\n}\u039b\u00b4\u03b1 ` e\u00b4t\u039b \u00b4 I \u02d8 }LpHq t\u03b1 \u0103 8.\nThe proofs of the two standard inequalities (16) and (17) are straightforward and are omitted.\n2.3. Assumptions on the nonlinearity. The nonlinear operator F : H \u00d1 H is assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous.\nAssumption 2. There exists LF P p0,8q such that for all x1, x2 P H\n|F px2q \u00b4 F px1q| \u010f LF |x2 \u00b4 x1|.\nAssumption 2 is the minimal condition which ensures the well-posedness of the stochastic evolution equation (see Section 2.5) and which permits the definition of numerical schemes below. In the sequel, Assumption 2 is always assumed to be satisfied. However note that the analysis of the long-time behavior and the proof of weak error estimates requires to impose additional assumptions on the nonlinearity F which are provided below.\nLet us first describe the conditions related to the long time behavior of the stochastic evolution equation. If Assumption 3 below is satisfied, the process is ergodic, see Section 2.6.\nAssumption 3. Let LF be defined in Assumption 2. Assume that LF \u0103 \u03bb1, where \u03bb1 \u201c min\njPN \u03bbj (see Assumption 1).\nThe ergodicity of the process ensures the existence of a unique invariant distribution denoted by \u00b58. In general, no expression of \u00b58 is known, however an expression is available when Assumption 4 below is satisfied.\nAssumption 4. There exists a function V : H \u00d1 R of class C1 such that for all x P H, F pxq \u201c \u00b4DV pxq, where D denotes the Fr\u00e9chet derivative operator.\nLet us now state the two regularity assumptions on the nonlinearity F which are required to prove the weak error estimates below.\nAssumption 5. For all \u03b4 P p0, 1 4 q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all x1, x2 P H 1\u00b4\u03b4 4 ,\none has \u02c7\n\u02c7\u039b\u00b4 1 2 ` \u03b4 4 ` F px2q \u00b4 F px1q \u02d8\u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4 ` 1 ` |x1| 1\u00b4\u03b4 4 ` |x2| 1\u00b4\u03b4 4 \u02d8\u02c7 \u02c7\u039b\u00b4 1 4 `\u03b4px2 \u00b4 x1q \u02c7 \u02c7.\nAssumption 6. The nonlinearity F is twice differentiable and there exist \u03b1F P r0, 1q and CF P p0,8q, such that for all x, h1, h2 P H, one has\n|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1FD2F pxq.ph1, h2q| \u010f CF |h1||h2|.\nNote that by the global Lipschitz continuity of F (Assumption 2), when F is differentiable one has\n|DF pxq.h| \u010f LF |h| for all x, h P H .\nWhereas Assumption 2 is always assumed to be satisfied in the sequel, the four other assumptions may not always satisfied simultaneously, and which of these assumptions are required to be satisfied is written explicitly for each of the results stated below.\n2.4. Description of an example. The objective of this section is to show that the stochastic partial differential equation (1) firs in the abstract framework described above.\nLet H \u201c L2p0, 1q, and let a : r0, 1s \u00d1 R be a smooth mapping, with minpaq \u0105 0. The operator \u039b is defined by\n\u039bxp\u03beq \u201c \u00b4B\u03be ` ap\u03beqxp\u03beq \u02d8\nfor all x P Dp\u039bq \u201c H10 p0, 1q X H2p0, 1q satisfy Assumption 1. The choice of the domain is related to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed in (1). When ap\u00a8q \u201c 1, \u00b4\u039b is the standard Laplace operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. In that case, \u03bbj \u201c pj\u03c0q2 and ej \u201c ? 2 sinpj\u03c0\u00a8q for all integers j P N.\nLet us now deal with the nonlinearity F in this setting. Let f : R \u00d1 R be a mapping of class C2 with bounded first and second order derivatives. Define the nonlinearity F : H \u00d1 H such that\nF pxq \u201c f ` xp\u00a8q \u02d8\nfor all x P H \u201c L2p0, 1q. The operator F is called a Nemytskii operator. Let us check that the regularity assumptions from Section 2.3 are satisfied in this example. \u201a Since f is globally Lipschitz continuous, it is straightforward to check that F is also globally Lipschitz continuous. \u201a Assumption 2 is satisfied when sup\nzPR |f 1pzq| \u0103 \u03bb1. \u201a Assumption 4 is satisfied\nwith\nV pxq \u201c \u00b4 \u017c 1\n0\nvpxp\u03beqqd\u03be\nwhere the mapping v : R \u00d1 R is an antiderivative of f , i. e. v1 \u201c f . Indeed, for all x, h P H , one has\nDV pxq.h \u201c \u00b4v1pxp\u00a8qqhp\u00a8q \u201c fpxp\u00a8qqhp\u00a8q \u201c F pxqh To check that Assumptions 5 and 6 are satisfied, some auxiliary inequalities are needed.\nOwing to [54, Theorem 16.12], for all \u03b1 P r0, 1 4 q, one has\nH\u03b1 \u201c W 2\u03b1,2p0, 1q and for all \u03b1 P p1\n4 , 1s, one has H\u03b1 \u201c W 2\u03b1,20 p0, 1q \u201c tx P W 2\u03b1,2p0, 1q; xp0q \u201c xp1q \u201c 0u,\nwhere W 2\u03b1,2p0, 1q are the standard fractional Sobolev spaces. Moreover, the norms | \u00a8 |\u03b1 and | \u00a8 |W 2\u03b1,2p0,1q are equivalent: for all \u03b1 P r0, 1szt14u, there exists C\u03b1 P p0,8q such that C\u00b41\u03b1 | \u00a8 |\u03b1 \u010f | \u00a8 |W 2\u03b1,2p0,1q \u010f C\u03b1| \u00a8 |\u03b1. Let us introduce the Banach spaces L8p0, 1q and L1p0, 1q, and recall several useful inequalities. First, for all \u03b4 \u0105 0, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that\n|x|L8p0,1q \u010f C\u03b4|x| W 1 2 `2\u03b4 \u010f C\u03b4|x| 1 4 `\u03b4.\nBy a duality argument, one then obtains the inequality\n(18) |\u039b\u00b4 14\u00b4\u03b4x|L2p0,1q \u010f |x|L1p0,1q for all x P L1p0, 1q. Moreover, for all \u03b4 \u0105 0, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that (19) |\u039b\u00b4 14 `\u03b4px1x2q|L1p0,1q \u010f C\u03b4|\u039b\u00b4 1 4 `2\u03b4x1|L2p0,1q|\u039b 1 4 \u00b4\u03b4x2|L2p0,1q.\nFinally, for all \u03b4 P p0, 1 4 q, and for any Lipschitz continuous function g : R2 \u00d1 R, there exists C\u03b4pgq P p0,8q such that for all x1, x2 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 4 , one has\n(20) |gpx1, x2q| 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 2 \u010f C\u03b4pgq ` |x1| 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 4 ` |x2| 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 4 \u02d8 .\nWe refer to [15, Section 3.2] for the proofs of these inequalities, using properties of the standard fractional Sobolev spaces.\nUsing the inequalities above, we are now in position to check the remaining assumptions. \u201a Assumption 5 is satisfied. Let \u03b4 P p0, 1\n4 q and x1, x2 P H 1 4 \u00b4\u03b4. Observe that\nF px2q \u00b4 F px1q \u201c px2 \u00b4 x1qgpx1, x2q where for all z1, z2 P R gpz1, z2q \u201c \u015f1 0 f 1 ` p1 \u00b4 \u03b8qz1 ` \u03b8z2 \u02d8\nd\u03b8. Applying succesively (18), (19) and (20) (with a constant C which may vary from line to line and depends on \u03b4), one obtains\n|\u039b\u00b4 12` \u03b44 ` F px2q \u00b4 F px1q \u02d8 |L2p0,1q \u010f C|\u039b\u00b4 1 4 ` \u03b4 2 ` F px2q \u00b4 F px1q \u02d8 |L1p0,1q \u010f C|\u039b\u00b4 14`\u03b4px2 \u00b4 x1q|L2p0,1q|\u039b 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 2 gpx1, x2q|L2p0,1q\n\u010f C|\u039b\u00b4 14`\u03b4px2 \u00b4 x1q|L2p0,1q ` |\u039b 14\u00b4 \u03b44x1|L2p0,1q ` |\u039b 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 4x2|L2p0,1q \u02d8 .\n\u201a Assumption 6 is satisfied: this is a straightforward consequence of the inequality (18) and of the identity D2F pxq.ph1, h2q \u201c f 2pxp\u00a8qqh1p\u00a8qh2p\u00a8q. One can then choose \u03b1F \u201c 14 ` \u03b4 for arbitrarily small \u03b4 P p0, 34q, then the inequality holds with CF \u201c C\u03b5sup\nzPR |f 2pzq|.\n2.5. Well-posedness and regularity properties. We are now in position to study the well-posedness property of the stochastic evolution equation\n(21) dXptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bXptqdt ` F pXptqqdt ` dW ptq, Xp0q \u201c x0, where the linear operator \u039b is introduced in Section 2.2, the nonlinearity F is introduced in Section 2.3, and the cylindrical Wiener process ` W ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is introduced in Section 2.1. The initial value x0 is an arbitrary element of H . For simplicity, it is assumed that x0 is deterministic, however the extension of the results below to random F0-measurable initial values with suitable moment bounds is straightforward and is omitted.\nAn H-valued continuous stochastic process ` Xptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is called a mild solution of the\nstochastic evolution equation (21) if it satisfies for all t \u011b 0\n(22) Xptq \u201c e\u00b4t\u039bx0 ` \u017c t\n0\ne\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039bF pXpsqqds ` \u017c t\n0\ne\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039bdW psq.\nIt is convenient to introduce the stochastic convolution ` W\u039bptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 defined by\n(23) W\u039bptq \u201c \u017c t\n0\ne\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039bdW psq\nfor all t \u011b 0. Owing to Assumption 1, the stochastic convolution defines a H-valued Gaussian process. In particular, applying It\u00f4\u2019s isometry formula yields for all t \u011b 0\nEr|W\u039bptq|2s \u201c \u017c t\n0\n}e\u00b4s\u039b}2L2pHqds \u201c \u00ff\njPN\n\u017c t\n0\ne\u00b42s\u03bbjds \u010f \u00ff\njPN\n1\n2\u03bbj \u0103 8.\nThe following well-posedness result is then obtained applying a standard fixed point argument. We refer for instance to [33, Section 7.1].\nProposition 2.1. Let Assumptions 1 and 2 be satisfied. Then the stochastic evolution equation (21) admits a unique mild solution ` Xptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0, for any arbitrary initial value x0 P H. The dependence of the mild solution with respect to the initial value x0 is often omitted to simplify the notation. The notation Exr\u03d5pXptqqs may be used below to compute the expected value of \u03d5pXptqq when the solution Xptq has initial value Xp0q \u201c x.\nIn addition, the following spatial and temporal regularity properties are satisfied: for all \u03b1 P r0, 1\n4 q and all T P p0,8q, there exists C\u03b1pT q P p0,8q such that for all x0 P H and all\nt, t1, t2 P p0, T s, one has `\nEr|Xptq|2\u03b1s \u02d8 1 2 \u010f C\u03b1pT q ` 1 ` t\u00b4\u03b1|x0|q, `\nEr|Xpt2q \u00b4 Xpt1q|2s \u02d8 1 2 \u010f C\u03b1pT q|t2 \u00b4 t1|\u03b1p1 ` pt1 ^ t2q\u00b4\u03b1|x0|q.\nThe proof of those regularity properties is based on combinations of the smoothing property (16) with the error estimate (17), using the mild formulation (22). Since the result is standard, the detailed proof is omitted.\n2.6. Invariant distribution. Let us now study the long-time behavior of the mild solution ` Xptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 given by (22), when Assumption 3 is satisfied. We refer to the monograph [32] for a general presentation of ergodicity results for parabolic semilinear SPDEs.\nFirst, in a general setting, one has the following result.\nProposition 2.2. Let Assumption 3 be satisfied. Then the stochastic evolution equation admits a unique invariant distribution \u00b58, and there exists C P p0,8q such that for any function \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C1 with bounded derivative, for all T \u011b 0 and x P H, one has\n\u02c7 \u02c7Exr\u03d5pXpT qqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b58 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C~\u03d5~1e\u00b4p\u03bb1\u00b4LF qT p1 ` |x|q.\nAs already explained, in general no expression of the invariant distribution \u00b58 is known, except when Assumption 4 is satisfied.\nFirst, when F \u201c 0, the invariant distribution of the stochastic convolution ` W\u039bptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 defined by (23) is the centered Gaussian distribution\n(24) \u03bd \u201c N p0, 1 2 \u039b\u00b41q, which is the distribution of the H-valued Gaussian random variable Z \u201c \u0159jPN \u03b3j? 2\u03bbj\nej where `\n\u03b3j \u02d8\njPN is a sequence of independent standard real-valued Gaussian random variables.\nSecond, when F \u201c \u00b4DV has a gradient structure (Assumption 4), for some V : H \u00d1 R, the invariant distribution \u00b58 is a Gibbs distribution with respect to the reference Gaussian distribution \u03bd. We refer to [32, Theorem 8.6.3].\nProposition 2.3. Let Assumptions 3 and 4 be satisfied. Then the invariant distribution \u00b58 of the stochastic evolution equation (21) is equal to the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039 defined by\n(25) d\u00b5\u2039pxq \u201c Z\u00b41e\u00b42V pxqd\u03bdpxq\nwith normalization constant Z \u201c \u015f e\u00b42V pxqd\u03bdpxq P p0,8q. Moreover, one has the bound\n(26)\n\u017c\n|x|d\u00b5\u2039pxq \u0103 8.\n2.7. Spectral Galerkin approximation. In order to justify most of the arguments provided below, it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary finite dimensional approximation procedure. In particular, in the finite dimensional framework, the derivatives may be interpreted as Fr\u00e9chet derivatives, all the linear operators are bounded, and the solutions of the auxiliary Kolmogorov partial differential equations can be understood in a classical sense. On the contrary, differentiability conditions in infinite dimension may require more care, and giving meaning to solutions of infinite dimensional Kolmogorov equations is more involved.\nThe auxiliary approximation procedure is standard in the literature. In this work, one can employ a spectral Galerkin approximation: for all J \u011b 1, let P J be the orthogonal projection operator defined by\nP Jx \u201c J \u00ff\nj\u201c1 xx, ejyej\nand introduce the stochastic evolution equation\ndXJptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bXJptqdt ` P JF pXJptqqdt ` P JdW ptq, XJp0q \u201c P Jx0. In fact, ` XJptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is solution of a stochastic differential equation with values in the finite\ndimensional space HJ \u201c spanpe1, . . . , eJq. To obtain the results stated below, it suffices to combine two arguments:\n\u201a proving moment and error estimates for XJ which are uniform with respect to J P N, \u201a letting J \u00d1 8.\nTo simplify the notation, in the sequel, the dimension J is omitted. All the proofs of moment and error estimates should be understood as being performed for XJ , with bounds independent of J . Similary, the regularity properties for solutions of Kolmogorov equations should also be understood in an approximate finite dimensional framework, with bounds independent of J . This standard convention is used everywhere in the sequel.\n3. Description of the modified Euler scheme\nThe objective of this section is to provide the definition of the proposed modified Euler scheme. Three equivalent formulations of the integrator are given below, however these formulations serve different purposes: the practical implementation is performed using the first one, whereas the second and third ones are employed to prove moment bounds and error estimates.\nTo define the numerical integrator, the following definition is convenient. A random variable \u0393 is called a cylindrical Gaussian random variable if\n\u0393 \u201c \u00ff\nnPN \u03b3nen\nwhere ` en \u02d8 nPN is the complete orthonormal system of H given in Assumption 1, and ` \u03b3n \u02d8\nnPN are independent real valued standard Gaussian random variables (Er\u03b3ns \u201c 0, Er\u03b32ns \u201c 1 for all n P N and Er\u03b3n\u03b3ms \u201c 0 for all n \u2030 m P N). Note that increments of the cylindrical Wiener processes \u2206Wn \u201c W ptn`1q \u00b4 W ptnq for n P N0 satisfy the equality in distribution\n\u2206Wn \u201c ? \u03c4\u0393n, where ` \u0393n \u02d8\nnPN is a sequence of independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables. Observe that cylindrical Gaussian random variables \u0393 do not take values in H : Er|\u0393|2s \u201c 8, and even |\u0393|2 \u201c 8 almost surely. However, if L P L2pHq is an Hilbert\u2013 Schmidt operator, then L\u0393 is a well-defined H-valued centered Gaussian random variable with Er|L\u0393|2s \u201c }L}2\nL2pHq. In order to explain the construction of the proposed modified Euler integrator, let us in-\ntroduce the standard linear implicit Euler scheme. Let ` \u0393n \u02d8\nnPN0 be a sequence of independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables, then set for all n P N0 (27) X\u03c4,stn`1 \u201c A\u03c4 \u00b4 X\u03c4,stn ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4,stn q ` ? \u03c4\u0393n \u00af ,\nwith initial value X\u03c4,st0 \u201c x0, where the bounded linear operator A\u03c4 is defined by (28) A\u03c4 \u201c pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41. The integrator (27) formally satisfies the equality\nX \u03c4,st n`1 \u201c X\u03c4,stn \u00b4 \u03c4\u039bX\u03c4,stn`1 ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4,stn q ` \u0393n,\nwhich justifies to interpret (27) as a semi-implicit Euler scheme, where the linearity is treated implicitly and the nonlinearity is treated explicitly. The formulation (27) is more suitable since A\u03c4 is a bounded linear operator, whereas \u039b is unbounded. In addition, A\u03c4\u0393n is a well-defined H-valued Gaussian random variable: indeed A\u03c4 is an Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator for all \u03c4 \u0105 0, with\n}A\u03c4}2L2pHq \u201c \u00ff jPN |A\u03c4ej |2 \u201c \u00ff jPN\n1\np1 ` \u03bbj\u03c4q2 \u0103 8.\nAs a consequence, for any initial value x0 P H , one has X\u03c4,stn P H for all n P N. Properties of the standard Euler scheme (27) are recalled in Section 8.\n3.1. Definition of the modified Euler scheme. We are now in position to define the modified Euler scheme. Let ` \u0393n,1 \u02d8\nnPN0 and ` \u0393n,2 \u02d8\nnPN0 be two independent sequences of independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables. Set for all n P N0 (29) X\u03c4n`1 \u201c A\u03c4 ` X\u03c4n ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4nq \u02d8 ` B\u03c4,1 ? \u03c4\u0393n,1 ` B\u03c4,2 ? \u03c4\u0393n,2, with initial value X\u03c40 \u201c x0, where the linear operators A\u03c4 , B\u03c4,1 and B\u03c4,2 are assumed to satisfy\n(30) A\u03c4 \u201c pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41, B\u03c4,1 \u201c 1? 2 pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41, B\u03c4,2B\u2039\u03c4,2 \u201c 1 2 pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41, where L\u2039 is the adjoint of a linear operator L. As already explained above, the random variable B\u03c4,1\u0393n,1 is a well-defined H-valued Gaussian random variable since B\u03c4,1 \u201c 1?2A\u03c4 is an Hilbert\u2013Schmidt linear operator. If the linear operator B\u03c4,2 satisfies the third condition in (30), then B\u03c4,2 is also an Hilbert\u2013Schmidt linear operator (under Assumption 1), thus B\u03c4,2\u0393n is also well-defined. Indeed, one has\n}B\u03c4,2}2L2pHq \u201c \u00ff jPN |B\u03c4,2ej |2 \u201c \u00ff jPN |B\u2039\u03c4,2ej |2 \u201c \u00ff jPN xB\u03c4,2B\u2039\u03c4,2ej , ejy \u201c \u00ff jPN\n1\n2p1 ` \u03bbj\u03c4q \u0103 8.\nThe motivations for imposing the conditions (30) for the linear operators are the following (more details are given below). First, if F \u201c 0, then the proposed scheme (29) preserves\nthe invariant distribution \u03bd of the stochastic evolution equation (21). Second, contrary to other methods (such as an exponential Euler scheme) which satisfy the first requirement, the proposed scheme can be implemented without knowing the eigenvalues ` \u03bbj \u02d8\njPN and the\neigenfunctions ` en \u02d8\njPN of \u039b.\nThe proposed scheme (29) is a modification of the standard Euler scheme (27), in particular note that A\u03c4 is given by (28) in both cases. However, let us highlight the major difference between the two schemes: the definition of the proposed integrator requires the use of two sequences of independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables. We refer to Remark 3.4 below for an explanation of this requirement.\nNote that there exist multiple choices to define linear operators B\u03c4,2 such that the third condition in (30) is satisfied. Precisely, all choices of the linear operators such that (30) is fulfilled give sequences of random variables `\nX\u03c4n \u02d8\nnPN0 which are equal in distribution. This is consistent with the fact that the distribution of a H-valued Gaussian random variable L\u0393 only depends on its covariance operator LL\u2039. A naive choice would be to set\nB\u03c4,2x \u201c \u00ff\njPN\n1 a\n2p1 ` \u03bbj\u03c4q xx, ejyej\nfor all x P H : then B\u03c4,2 would be the square root of the self-adjoint operator 12A\u03c4 . However, the definition of B\u03c4,2 above would require the knowledge of the eigenvalues ` \u03bbj \u02d8 jPN and the eigenfunctions ` ej \u02d8\njPN of \u039b. To avoid this requirement, which may be restrictive\nin pratice, note that it is instead possible to use a Cholesky decomposition of the operator 1 2 A\u03c4 \u201c 12pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41. More precisely, in the context of the example described in Section 2.4 corresponding to the stochastic partial differential equation (1), the implementation of the scheme requires a spatial discretization procedure, which may be performed using a finite differences approximation (with mesh size denoted by h), the Cholesky decomposition is then performed at the finite dimensional approximation level. Computing the Cholesky decomposition is generally less expensive than identifying the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the linear operator \u039bh (which is a tridiagonal matrix for the example). In the sequel, the spatial approximation is omitted and we focus only on the temporal discretization. The convergence results below may be generalized at the finite dimensional approximation level, with error bounds independent of h (see Remark 4.5).\nBased on the discussion above, it is clear that the proposed scheme (29) is a modification of the standard scheme (27) which has a more expensive implementation, due to the need to compute an additional Gaussian random variable B\u03c4,2\u0393n,2 at each iteration. However, the huge benefits of using the modified Euler scheme (29) will be stated and illustrated below: the main results are stated in Section 4, whereas comparisons with an exponential Euler scheme and the standard Euler scheme are provided in Section 7 and 8 respectively.\n3.2. Second formulation of the modified Euler scheme. Let us introduce an equivalent formulation of the proposed integrator (29), where a single sequence ` \u0393n \u02d8\nnPN0 of independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables is needed. This formulation is not used in practice.\nDefine the self-adjoint linear operator B\u03c4 such that\nB2\u03c4 \u201c B2\u03c4,1 ` B\u03c4,2B\u2039\u03c4,2 \u201c 1\n2\n` A2\u03c4 ` A\u03c4 \u02d8 \u201c 1 2 p2I ` \u03c4\u039bqpI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b42\nwhere A\u03c4 , B\u03c4,1 and B\u03c4,2 satisfy the conditions (30). The linear operator B\u03c4 is given by\n(31) B\u03c4x \u201c \u00ff\njPN\na\n2 ` \u03bbj\u03c4? 2 p1 ` \u03bbj\u03c4q xx, ejyej\nfor all x P H . For all n P N0, set\n(32) X\u0302\u03c4n`1 \u201c A\u03c4 ` X\u0302\u03c4n ` \u03c4F pX\u0302\u03c4nq \u02d8 ` ? \u03c4B\u03c4\u0393n\nwith initial value X\u0302\u03c40 \u201c x0, where A\u03c4 and B\u03c4 are given by (28) and (31) respectively, and where ` \u0393n \u02d8\nnPN0 is a sequence of independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables. Then\none has the following result: the sequences ` X\u03c4n \u02d8 nPN0 and ` X\u0302\u03c4n \u02d8 nPN0 are equal in distribution, for any value \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q of the time-step size. This result is a straightforward consequence of the following equality in distribution\n(33) B\u03c4,1\u0393n,1 ` B\u03c4,2\u0393n,2 \u201c B\u03c4\u0393n,\nif \u0393n,1 and \u0393n,2 are two independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables. Indeed, the random variables in the left and the right hand sides of (33) are centered H-valued Gaussian random variables with the same covariance operator. Observe that B\u03c4 is indeed an Hilbert\u2013 Schmidt linear operator, so that B\u03c4\u0393n is a well-defined H-valued Gaussian random variable.\nIn the sequel, the same notation ` X\u03c4n \u02d8\nnPN0 is used for both formulations (29) and (32) of\nthe modified Euler scheme, since all equalities are understood as equalities in distribution. The second formulation (32) is more convenient for the analysis the scheme, however this formulation could be implemented only if the eigenvalues ` \u03bbj \u02d8\njPN and the eigenfunctions `\nej \u02d8\njPN of \u039b were known, whereas the first formulation (29) can be implemented without\nthis requirement as explained in Section 3.1. The formulation (32) clearly shows why the proposed scheme is a modification of the standard Euler scheme (27): the random variable A\u03c4\u0393n in (27) is replaced by B\u03c4\u0393n in (32). Let us now justify why introducing the modification of the standard Euler scheme with B\u03c4 such that (31) holds is relevant.\nProposition 3.1. Assume that F \u201c 0. Let A\u03c4 and B\u03c4 be given by (28) and (31) respectively. Then, for any value \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q of the time-step size, the unique invariant distribution of the numerical scheme (32) is the Gaussian distribution \u03bd given by (24): if X\u03c40 is a random variable with distribution \u03bd, independent of the sequence ` \u0393n \u02d8\nnPN0 of cylindrical Gaussian random variables, then the distribution of X\u03c4n is equal to \u03bd for all n P N0.\nNote that the standard Euler scheme (27) does not preserve the invariant distribution \u03bd when F \u201c 0, see Section 8 for more details and the issues which are raised by this nonpreservation of the invariant distribution. We also refer to Section 9 for two applications of Proposition 3.1, which justify the superiority of the modified Euler scheme over the standard Euler method, in this context where the process is Gaussian: the definition of asymptotic preserving schemes for a class of multiscale stochastic evolution systems in an averaging regime (Section 9.1) and the definition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo proposal kernel (Section 9.2).\nProof. The proof is straightforward. On the one hand, the unique invariant distribution of (32) when F \u201c 0 is the centered H-valued Gaussian random variable with covariance operator equal to \u03c4pI \u00b4 A2\u03c4 q\u00b41B2\u03c4 . On the other hand, using the definitions of A\u03c4 and B\u03c4 , one has the identity\nI \u00b4 A2\u03c4 \u201c 2\u03c4\u039bB2\u03c4 . Therefore one has\n(34) \u03c4B2\u03c4 pI \u00b4 A2\u03c4 q\u00b41 \u201c 1 2 \u039b\u00b41\nwhich is the covariance of the centered Gaussian distribution \u03bd.\n3.3. Third formulation of the modified Euler scheme. In this section, we introduce the third formulation of the modified Euler scheme, which is a crucial tool to prove the main results below. This formulation consists in interpreting the modified Euler scheme (29), or equivalently its second formulation (32), as the accelerated exponentiel Euler scheme associated with a modified stochastic evolution equation, of the type\n(35) dX\u03c4 ptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4X\u03c4 ptqdt ` Q\u03c4F pX\u03c4 ptqqdt ` Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW ptq,\ndepending on two self-adjoint linear operators \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 defined below. The initial value is X\u03c4 p0q \u201c x0. The mild formulation of the solution ` X\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 of the modified equation (35) is given by\n(36) X\u03c4 ptq \u201c e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4x0 ` \u017c t\n0\ne\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4F pX\u03c4psqqds ` \u017c t\n0\ne\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW psq,\nfor all t \u011b 0, and the accelerated exponential Euler scheme is obtained by\n(37) X\u03c4,n`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4X\u03c4,n ` \u039b\u00b41\u03c4 pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 qQ\u03c4F pX\u03c4,nq ` \u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW psq,\nfor all n P N0, using the identity \u015ftn`1 tn e\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4ds \u201c \u039b\u00b41\u03c4 pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 q. Comparing (32) and (37), for any value \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q of the time-step size, the equalities in distribution `\nX\u03c4n \u02d8 nPN0 \u201c ` X\u0302\u03c4n \u02d8 nPN0 \u201c ` X\u03c4,n \u02d8\nnPN0 are satisfied when the following equalities hold:\npI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4\npI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 \u201c \u039b\u00b41\u03c4 pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 qQ\u03c4 B2\u03c4 \u201c \u017c \u03c4\n0\ne\u00b4s\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4e \u00b4s\u039b\u03c4ds.\nThis leads to define the linear operators in the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) as follows. For all j P N and all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, set\n(38)\n\u03bb\u03c4,j \u201c logp1 ` \u03c4\u03bbjq\n\u03c4 \u0105 0\nq\u03c4,j \u201c logp1 ` \u03c4\u03bbjq\n\u03bbj\u03c4 \u0105 0,\nand define the self-adjoint linear operators \u039b\u03c4 , Q\u03c4 and Q 1 2 \u03c4 by\n(39)\n\u039b\u03c4x \u201c \u00ff\njPN \u03bb\u03c4,jxx, ejyej,\nQ\u03c4x \u201c \u00ff\njPN q\u03c4,jxx, ejyej ,\nQ 1 2 \u03c4 \u201c \u00ff\njPN\n? q\u03c4,jxx, ejyej ,\nfor all x P H . It is straightforward to check that the conditions above are satisfied with these definitions of \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 .\nNote that the linear operators Q\u03c4 and \u039b\u03c4 commute, and they both commute with the linear operator \u039b. The linear operators e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 are defined by\ne\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4x \u201c \u00ff jPN e\u00b4t\u03bb\u03c4,jxx, ejyej\nfor all x P H , all t \u011b 0 and all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. Since \u03bb\u03c4,j \u011b 0 for all j P N and all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, for all t \u011b 0 the linear operator e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 is bounded, with }e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 }LpHq \u010f 1.\nIt is worth mentioning that \u039b\u03c4 is an unbounded operator, with \u03bb\u03c4,j growing like logpjq when j \u00d1 8, whereas \u03bbj grows like j2. This major difference in the behaviors of \u039b\u03c4 and \u039b leads to technical difficulties in the analysis below. Observe also that Q 1 2 \u03c4 is an Hilbert\u2013 Schmidt linear operator for any \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q: \u0159\njPN q\u03c4,j \u0103 8. As a consequence, the Gaussian random variables \u015ft\n0 e\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW psq and \u015ftn`1 tn e\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW psq appearing in the mild\nformulation (36) and in the associated scheme (37) are well-defined with values in H . More precisely, it is straightforward to check that the following well-posedness result holds. The details of the proof are omitted.\nProposition 3.2. Let Assumptions 1 and 2 be satisfied. For any \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, let \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 be defined by (39). Then, for any initial value x0 P H, the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) admits a unique global mild solution ` X\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0, satisfying (36).\nMoreover, if Assumption 3 is satisfied, the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) admits a unique invariant distribution \u00b5\u03c4,8.\nNote that Proposition 5.4 stated and proved below (see Section 5) gives a refined version of Proposition 3.2, with bounds which are uniform with respect to \u03c4 .\nWhen \u03c4 \u00d1 0, it is observed that for any fixed j P N, one has \u03bb\u03c4,j \u00d1 \u03bbj and q\u03c4,j \u00d1 1. As a consequence, it is expected that X\u03c4 ptq converges to Xptq, at least in distribution, for all t \u011b 0. Proving this convergence result is part and giving the rate of convergence with respect to \u03c4 are part of the proof of Theorem 4.8. The proof requires precise error estimates for the errors \u039b\u03c4x \u00b4 \u039b\u03c4x and Q\u03c4x \u00b4 x: see Lemma 5.2 in Section 5.1.\nThe third formulation (37) of the modified Euler scheme is crucial in the analysis, but it is not needed for the implementation of the scheme (which is performed using the initial formulation (29)). In particular, the linear operators \u039b\u03c4 , e\n\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 or Q\u03c4 do not need to be computed.\nOne of the main properties of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) is the following result concerning its invariant distribution, when the conditions of Proposition 2.3 are fulfilled.\nProposition 3.3. Let Assumptions 3 and 4 be satisfied. For any value \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q of the time-step size, the unique invariant distribution \u00b5\u03c4,8 (see Proposition 3.2) of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) is equal to the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039 given by (25).\nObserve that if F \u201c 0, this result is consistent with Proposition 3.1 above (when F \u201c 0, the accelerated exponential Euler scheme gives X\u03c4,n \u201c X\u03c4 ptnq for all n P N by construction). The crucial feature of the modified equation (35) associated with the modified Euler scheme (29) which justifies Proposition 3.3 is the presence of the operators Q\u03c4 and Q 1 2 \u03c4 in front of the nonlinearity and of the Wiener process respectively. The proof of Proposition 3.3 is similar to the proof of Proposition 2.3: it consists in applying a spectral Galerkin approximation procedure (see Section 2.7), in identifying the invariant distribution for the finite dimensional approximation as a Gibbs distribution with respect to the finite dimensional approximation of \u03bd, and in taking the limit. The details are omitted. Note that in general the result of Proposition 3.3 does not hold when F does not have the gradient structure given by Assumption 4, hence the need to treat separately the gradient and the general case below.\n3.4. Additional remarks. Before proceeding with the statement and proofs of the main results concerning the modified Euler scheme, let us state two remarks concerning the construction of the integrator in its first formulation (29), in particular to explain how the conditions (30) for the linear operators B\u03c4,1 and B\u03c4,2 are found, and why two sequences of cylindrical Gaussian random variables appear in the formulation (29). Remarks 3.4 and 3.5 do not play any role in the analysis below.\nRemark 3.4. Assume that F \u201c 0. Introduce the self-adjoint linear operators A\u0303\u03c4 \u201c B\u0303\u03c4 \u201c pI ` 2\u03c4\u039bq\u00b41{2.\nThen it is straightforward to check that the identity\n2\u03c4\u039bB\u03032\u03c4 \u201c 1 \u00b4 A\u03032\u03c4 is satisfied. Introduce the auxiliary numerical scheme defined by (40) X\u0303\u03c4n`1 \u201c A\u0303\u03c4X\u0303\u03c4n ` ? \u03c4 B\u0303\u03c4 \u0393\u0303n \u201c A\u0303\u03c4 ` X\u0303\u03c4n ` ? \u03c4 \u0393\u0303n \u02d8 ,\nwith initial value X\u0303\u03c40 \u201c x0, where ` \u0393\u0303n \u02d8\nnPN0 is a sequence of independent cylindrical Gaussian\nrandom variables. The identity above shows that the auxiliary scheme (40) preserves the Gaussian invariant distribution \u03bd, for any value \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q of the time-step size. However, this auxiliary scheme is not suitable for a general practical implementation since computing A\u0303\u03c4 and B\u0303\u03c4 would require the knowledge of the eigenvalues ` \u03bbj \u02d8\njPN and of the eigenfunctions `\nej \u02d8\njPN of \u039b.\nThe formulation (29) of the modified Euler scheme is obtained setting\nX\u03c4n \u201c X\u0303 \u03c4 2 2n\nwith \u0393n,1 \u201c \u0393\u03032n and \u0393n,2 \u201c \u0393\u03032n`1. This means that, formally, when F \u201c 0, the modified Euler scheme with time-step size \u03c4 is obtained by composing two steps of the auxiliary scheme (40) with time-step size \u03c4\n2 defined above.

In addition, this interpretation also shows that the cylindrical Gaussian random variables \u0393n,1 and \u0393n,2 may interpreted in terms of increments of the cylindrical Wiener process as follows:\n\u0393n,1 \u201c W ptn` 1 2 q \u00b4 W ptnq, \u0393n,2 \u201c W ptn`1q \u00b4 W ptn` 1 2 q,\nwith tn \u201c n\u03c4 and tn` 1 2 \u201c tn ` \u03c42 \u201c tn`tn`1 2 . The reason why two sequences ` \u0393n,1qnPN0 and ` \u0393n,2 \u02d8\nnPN0 of cylindrical Gaussian random variables appear in the formulation (29)\nof the modified Euler scheme is now clear using this interpretation based on the auxiliary scheme (40).\nFinally, observe that the Gaussian distribution \u03bd for any value \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q is preserved both by the auxiliary scheme (40) and by the modified Euler scheme (29) when F \u201c 0, for any value \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q of the time-step size. This property is consistent with the equality X\u03c4n \u201c X\u0303 \u03c4 2 2n for all n P N0. Remark 3.5. The definition of the modified Euler scheme (29) requires auxiliary linear operators similar to those appearing in the definition of the postprocessed integrator introduced in [22]:\n(41)\n$\n\u2019 &\n\u2019 %\nX \u03c4,pp n`1 \u201c A\u03c4\n\u00b4\nX\u03c4,ppn ` \u03c4F ` X\u03c4,ppn ` ? \u03c4 1\n2 A\u03c4\u03b3n\n\u02d8 ` ? \u03c4\u0393n \u00af ,\nX\u03c4,ppn \u201c X\u03c4,ppn ` 1\n2 J\u03c4\n? \u03c4\u0393n,\nwhere A\u03c4 is given by (28) and the linear operator J\u03c4 is such that J\u03c4J \u2039 \u03c4 \u201c pI ` 12\u03c4\u039bq\u00b41. The initial value is Xpp0 \u201c x0, and ` \u0393n \u02d8\nnPN are independent cylindrical Gaussian random variables.\nLike for the definition of B\u03c4,2, there are multiple choices to choose J\u03c4 , and in practice a Cholesky decomposition of pI ` 1\n2 \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 can be employed. The operators 1 2 pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 and\npI ` 1 2 \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41 appearing in the two Cholesky decompositions to define B\u03c4,2 and J\u03c4 have similar expressions, this observation is justified below. The postprocessing integrator (41) is another type of modification of the standard Euler scheme (27). It has been introduced in [22] to provide a better approximation of the invariant distribution \u00b58: it is proved that if F \u201c 0, then X\u03c4,ppN converges in distribution to the Gaussian distribution \u03bd (defined by (24)) when N \u00d1 8, for any value of the time-step size \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q (while one has X\u03c4,ppn \u201c X\u03c4,stn for all n P N0). This property justifies the requirement that J\u03c4 is a solution of J\u03c4J \u2039 \u03c4 \u201c pI ` 12\u03c4\u039bq\u00b41, and the similitude with the requirement in (30) for B\u03c4,2 such that \u03bd is also preserved by the modified Euler scheme (29). Using the postprocessed integrator (41) is computationally less expensive than using the modified Euler scheme (29): indeed it is required to compute X\u03c4,ppn only at the last step n \u201c N of the numerical experiment, if the objective is to approximate the invariant distribution only. Note that it is not known whether the postprocessed integrator (41) leads to improved approximation of the invariant distribution \u00b58 in general (when F \u2030 0). In addition, as will be explained below using the modified Euler scheme (29) results in better qualitative properties than using the standard Euler integrator (27), or than using the postprocessed integrator (41) if X\u03c4,ppn is not computed at all time steps. Computing X \u03c4,pp n at all time steps would result in a scheme with essentially the same computational cost as using the modified Euler scheme (29).\nRemark 3.6. The recent article [1] presents another illustration of how the choice of the discretization of the noise may have an impact on the spatial regularity property of the numerical solution. In [1], the linear part is discretized using explicit-stabilized integrators, instead of an implicit discretization with A\u03c4 \u201c pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b41, and two methods are proposed. One of the methods has a behavior similar to the one of the modified Euler scheme studied in this article. However, the method from [1] does not preserve the Gaussian invariant distribution \u03bd in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck case.\n4. Main results\nWe are in position to state the main results of this article. In this section, the linear operator \u039b and the nonlinear operator F satisfy at least Assumptions 1 and 2 respectively. Recall that the time-step size is denoted by \u03c4 and satisfies \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q.\nLet us first recall the definition of the modified Euler scheme (29), using its second formulation (32): one has\n(42) X\u03c4n`1 \u201c A\u03c4 ` X\u03c4n ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4nq \u02d8 ` ? \u03c4B\u03c4\u0393n, X \u03c4 0 \u201c x0.\nTo illustrate the main qualitative and quantitative results concerning the scheme (42), it is convenient to introduce two integrators which have been extensively studied in the literature. First, the standard Euler scheme is given by (27): one has\n(43) X\u03c4,stn`1 \u201c A\u03c4 \u00b4 X\u03c4,stn ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4,stn q ` ? \u03c4\u0393n \u00af , X\u03c40 \u201c x0.\nSecond, the (accelerated) exponential Euler scheme is given as follows: for all n P N0,\n(44) X\u03c4,en`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039bX\u03c4,en ` \u039b\u00b41pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039bqF pX\u03c4,en q ` \u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039bdW psq, X\u03c4,e0 \u201c x0.\nThe qualitative behavior of the modified Euler scheme (42) is studied in Subsection 4.1. Error estimates for this new integrator are then stated in Subsection 4.2 and 4.3. The most relevant result which justifies the study of the proposed scheme is Theorem 4.4 in Subsection 4.2, in a specific context (approximation of the Gibbs invariant distribution under the gradient structure assumption). On the contrary, the results in Subsection 4.3 are more standard and are verified for the other schemes, however precise statements and detailed proofs are provided since they show that the new scheme is applicable in a general framework. Old and new results on the standard and exponential Euler schemes are stated in Section 4.4 and 4.5 respectively, in order to illustrate the properties of the modified Euler schemes compared with those methods.\n4.1. Qualitative behavior of the modified Euler scheme. Let us first assume that x0 \u201c 0 and F \u201c 0: therefore the solution of the stochastic evolution equation (21) is the stochastic convolution ` W\u039bptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 defined by (23). In that setting, the solution of the modified Euler scheme is given by\n(45)\nW \u03c4N \u201c N\u00b41 \u00ff\nn\u201c0 AN\u00b4n\u00b41\u03c4\n\u00b4 B\u03c4,1 ? \u03c4\u0393n,1 ` B\u03c4,2 ? \u03c4\u0393n,2 \u00af\n\u201c N\u00b41 \u00ff\nn\u201c0 AN\u00b4n\u00b41\u03c4 B\u03c4\n? \u03c4\u0393n\nfor all N P N0, using the two equivalent formulations (29) and (32). We are in position to state the first main result of this article.\nTheorem 4.1. For all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and all N P N, the distributions \u03c1ptN q \u201c \u03c1W\u039bptN q and \u03c1\u03c4N \u201c \u03c1W \u03c4N of the Gaussian random variables W\u039bptNq and W \u03c4N are equivalent. Moreover, they are both equivalent to the Gaussian distribution \u03bd given by (24).\nNote that Theorem 4.1 does not hold for the standard Euler scheme (27): for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and all N P N, the distributions of W\u039bptnq and of\nW \u03c4,st N \u201c\nN\u00b41 \u00ff n\u201c0 AN\u00b4n\u03c4 ? \u03c4\u0393n\nare singular, see for instance [13].\nProof of Theorem 4.1. The proof follows from applying the Feldman-Hajek criterion, see for instance [33, Theorem 2.25].\nThe covariance operator of the Gaussian distribution \u03bd is denoted by Q \u201c 1 2 \u039b\u00b41, and for all T P p0,8q, the covariance operator of the Gaussian distribution \u03c1pT q \u201c \u03c1W\u039bpT q is given by\nQpT q \u201c \u017c T\n0\ne\u00b42t\u039bdt \u201c 1 2 \u039b\u00b41 ` I \u00b4 e\u00b42T\u039bq \u201c Q ` I \u00b4 e\u00b42T\u039bq.\nIt suffices to check the two following items to check that \u03c1pT q and \u03bd are equivalent for all T P p0,8q.\n\u201a The ranks QpHq and QpT qpHq of the operators Q and QpT q respectively are equal to H 1 2 . \u201a The linear operator RpT q \u201c ` Q\u00b4 1 2QpT q 12 \u02d8` Q\u00b4 1 2QpT q 12\n\u02d8\u2039 \u00b4 I is an Hilbert-Schmidt operator: indeed one has\n\u00ff jPN |RpT qej |2 \u201c \u00ff jPN e\u00b42T\u03bbj \u0103 8.\nFor all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and N P N, the covariance operator of the Gaussian distribution \u03c1\u03c4N \u201c \u03c1W \u03c4N is given by\nQ\u03c4N \u201c \u03c4 N\u00b41 \u00ff\nn\u201c0 AN\u00b4n\u00b41\u03c4 B\u03c4 ` AN\u00b4n\u00b41\u03c4 B\u03c4 \u02d8\u2039\n\u201c \u03c4B2\u03c4 pI \u00b4 A2\u03c4 q\u00b41pI \u00b4 A2N\u03c4 q \u201c 1 2 \u039b\u00b41pI \u00b4 A2N\u03c4 q\n\u201c QpI \u00b4 A2N\u03c4 q, owing to the identity (34). As above, it suffices to check the two following items to check that \u03c1\u03c4N and \u03bd are equivalent.\n\u201a The ranks QpHq and QHN pHq of the operators Q and Q\u03c4N respectively are equal to H 1 2 . \u201a The linear operator R\u03c4N \u201c ` Q\u00b4 1 2 pQ\u03c4 q 1 2 \u02d8` Q\u00b4 1 2 pQ\u03c4N q 1 2\n\u02d8\u2039 \u00b4 I is an Hilbert-Schmidt operator: one has\n\u00ff jPN |R\u03c4Nej|2 \u201c \u00ff jPN\n1\np1 ` \u03c4\u03bbjq2N \u0103 8.\nThe application of the Feldman-Hajek criterion then concludes the proof of Theorem 4.1.\nIn the semilinear case (F \u2030 0), one has the following result, which shows that the modified Euler scheme (29) preserves the spatial regularity of the solution of the stochastic evolution equation (21), at all times.\nTheorem 4.2. Let F satisfy Assumption 2, and let x0 P H be an arbitrary initial value. For all \u03b1 P r0, 1q, \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and N \u011b 1, the following statements are equivalent:\n(i) Er|XpN\u03c4q|2\u03b1s \u0103 8, (ii) Er|X\u03c4N |2\u03b1s \u0103 8, (iii) \u03b1 P r0, 1\n4 q.\nIt is worth mentioning that Theorem 4.2 does not hold for the standard Euler scheme (27): one has Er|X\u03c4,stN |2\u03b1s \u0103 8 for all \u03b1 P p0, 1\n2 q, see [13]. This means that for a fixed time step size \u03c4 , the approximate\nsolution computed using the standard Euler scheme has higher spatial regularity than the exact solution, whereas the approximate solution computed using the modified Euler scheme\npreserves the spatial regularity property, expressed in terms of the Sobolev-like norms denoted by | \u00a8 |\u03b1. See Figures 1 and 2 for a numerical illustration of the different qualitative behaviors when using the modified Euler scheme and the standard Euler scheme.\nThe proof of Theorem 4.2 is straightforward. Note that more precise moment bounds for X\u03c4n , which in particular are uniform over \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, are stated and proved below (see Lemma 5.8 in Section 5.5) and are instrumental in the error analysis.\nProof of Theorem 4.2. First, it is straightforward to check that Er|XpN\u03c4q|2s \u0103 8 and Er|X\u03c4N |2s \u0103 8 for all N P N and all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q.

If Assumption 3 is satisfied, then for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, the modified Euler scheme (29) admits a unique invariant probability distribution \u00b5\u03c48, which satisfies\n(46) sup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q\n\u017c\n|x|2\u03b1d\u00b5\u03c48 \u0103 8.\nfor all \u03b1 P r0, 1 4 q.\nMoreover, there exists C P p0,8q, such that for all functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C1, for all x0 P H, for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and for all N P N, one has\n(47) \u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c48 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C~\u03d5~1e\u00b4\u03baN\u03c4 p1 ` |x0|q,\nwith \u03ba \u201c \u03bb1\u00b4LF 1`\u03c40\u03bb1 P p0, \u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q.\nFinally, when F \u201c 0, then \u00b5\u03c48 \u201c \u03bd is the Gaussian distribution given by (24), which is the invariant distribution of the stochastic convolution (23).\nContrary to the previous results Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, the first and second parts of Theorem 4.3 hold also for the standard Euler scheme. Note that the last part of Theorem 4.3 is given by Proposition 3.1 above, and is not satisfied by the standard Euler scheme.\nThe proof of Proposition 4.3 employs standard arguments but requires several technical moment estimates to check that C and \u03ba do not depend on \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. The proof is thus postponed to Section 5.5.\n4.2. Approximation in the total variation distance of the Gibbs invariant dis-\ntribution. We are in position to state the major result of this article.\nTheorem 4.4. Let the nonlinearity F satisfy Assumptions 3, 4, 5 and 6. For all \u03b4 P p0, 1 2 q\nand \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q one has (48) dTVp\u00b5\u03c48, \u00b5\u2039q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4, where \u00b5\u03c48 is the invariant distribution of `\nX\u03c4nqn\u011b0 (Proposition 4.3) and \u00b5\u2039 is the invariant distribution of ` Xptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 (Proposition 2.2), with is the Gibbs distribution given by (25)\n(Proposition 2.3). Moreover, for all \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 q and \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all\nx0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 , all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and N P N, with N\u03c4 \u011b 1, and any bounded measurable function \u03d5 P BbpHq, one has\n(49) \u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4~\u03d5~ \u00b4 \u03c4 1 2\n\u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 q ` e\u00b4\u03baN\u03c4 p1 ` |x0|q \u00af ,\nwith \u03ba \u201c logp1`\u03c40\u03bb1q \u03c40\u03bb1 p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q P p0, \u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q.\nNote that the weak error estimate (49) can be equivalently written as\n(50) dTVp\u03c1X\u03c4 N , \u00b5\u2039q \u010f C\u03b4\n\u00b4\n\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 q ` e\u00b4\u03baN\u03c4 p1 ` |x0|q \u00af ,\nwhere we recall that \u03c1X\u03c4 N denotes the distribution of the H-valued random variable X\u03c4N . The condition N\u03c4 \u011b 1 is not restrictive when considering the regime of approximation of the invariant distribution. The condition x0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 for the initial value is not very restrictive. It may be weakened at the price of additional technical arguments, which are omitted in order to focus on the most original points of the approach to prove the main results.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Theorem 4.4 is the first result in the literature where a numerical approximation of the invariant distribution of an infinite dimensional stochastic evolution equation equation is obtained in the total variation distance. Indeed, previous results are obtained in the d2 distance introduced in Section 2.1, which requires regularity of the function \u03d5 to obtain a weak error estimate of the type (49). For the standard Euler scheme, as explained in [13], the total variation distance\ndTVp\u00b5\u03c4,st8 , \u00b5\u2039q \u201c 2 does not converge to 0 when \u03c4 \u00d1 0 (where \u00b5\u03c4,st8 denotes the invariant distribution of the standard Euler scheme (43)). The equality above holds when F \u201c 0, whereas using the modified Euler scheme one has \u00b5\u03c48 \u201c \u03bd \u201c \u00b5\u2039 for all t \u011b 0 when F \u201c 0 (see Proposition 3.1).\nTheorem 4.4 is thus a major improvement over existing results. New results with approximation in the total variation distance for the standard and the exponential Euler schemes are stated in Section 4.4 and 4.5 below, and are compared with Theorem 4.11.\nAs will be explained below, the value 1{2 for the order of convergence in Theorem 4.4 has a natural meaning: it is in correspondance with the temporal H\u00f6lder regularity 1{4 for the solution of (21), and this order coincides with the usual order of convergence in the distance d2 of the numerical scheme in general. It is expected that the value 1{2 is optimal, but checking this is left open.\nRemark 4.5. In practice, a spatial discretization needs to be applied to implement the modified Euler scheme (42), using either a finite differences, a finite element, or a spectral Galerkin method. The result of Theorem 4.4 needs to be interpreted carefully in this context. Let h P p0, h0q denote the spatial discretization parameter (with h \u00d1 0): then (for instance) the error estimate (48) is written as\ndTVp\u00b5\u03c4,h8 , \u00b5h\u2039q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4\nwhere C\u03b4 P p0,8q is independent of h, and where \u00b5\u03c4,h8 and \u00b5h\u2039 denote the invariant distributions, depending on h. Since the supports of these distributions is finite dimensional (with dimension depending on h), one has\ndTVp\u00b5h\u2039 , \u00b5\u2039q \u201c dTVp\u00b5\u03c4,h8 , \u00b5\u03c48q \u201c 2\ndoes not converge to 0 when h \u00d1 0. Therefore, the total variation distance dTVp\u00b5\u03c4,h8 , \u00b5\u2039q does not satisfy an error estimate of the type (48).\nLet us give the most important arguments of the proof of Theorem 4.4. The objective is to prove a weak error estimate of the type (49), for bounded and continuous functions \u03d5 (this is sufficient, see Section 2.1). First, the modified Euler scheme (42) is understood using its third formulation (37): it is interpreted as the (accelerated) exponential Euler scheme applied to the modified stochastic evolution equation (35). With this interpretation, the left-hand side of the weak error estimate may be decomposed as\n(51) Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 \u201c Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pN\u03c4qqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 ` Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pN\u03c4qqs,\nwhere ` X\u03c4 ptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 denotes the solution of (35) and using the identity Xn,\u03c4 \u201c X\u03c4n for all n P N0, see Section 3.3.\nOn the one hand, the first term on the right-hand side of (51) vanishes when N \u00d1 8, owing to Proposition 3.3: under Assumptions 4, \u00b5\u2039 is the unique invariant distribution of the modified equation (35) for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. This is the first crucial observation which leads to Theorem 4.4. Additional technical arguments are required to proved the error estimate.\nOn the other hand, the second term on the right-hand side of (51) can be treated using the following result.\nProposition 4.6. Let Assumptions 3 and 6 be satisfied and \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R be a bounded and continuous function. For all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, t \u011b 0 and x P H, set\nu\u03c4 pt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pX\u03c4ptqqs.\nFor all t \u0105 0, u\u03c4pt, \u00a8q is differentiable and one has the following estimate: for all \u03b4 P p0, 12q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and for all t P p2\u03c4,8q, one has\n(52) \u02c7 \u02c7Du\u03c4 pt, xq.h \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4e\u00b4\u03bat~\u03d5~0 ` 1 ^ pt \u00b4 2\u03c4q \u02d8\u00b4 1 2 \u00b4? \u03c4 |h| ` ` 1 ^ pt \u00b4 2\u03c4q \u02d8\u00b4 1 2 `\u03b4|\u039b\u00b4 12`\u03b4h| \u00af\nfor all x, h P H, with \u03ba \u201c logp1`\u03c40\u03bb1q \u03c4\u03bb1 p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q \u0105 0. As will be explained in Section 5.4, the mapping pt, xq P p0,8q \u02c6 H \u00d1 R is solution of the Kolmogorov equation Btu\u03c4 \u201c L\u03c4u\u03c4 with initial value u\u03c4p0, \u00a8q \u201c \u03d5, where L\u03c4 is the infinitesimal generator of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35). Proposition 4.6 has the form of a strong Feller property for the modified equation, the challenge is to obtain estimates which hold uniformly with respect to \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q in a certain sense: this is why the condition t \u0105 2\u03c4 appears in the statement above, and why an additionnal term ? \u03c4 |h| also appears in (52).\nProposition 4.6 is used as follows to prove an upper bound on the second term of the right-hand side of (51): one has the identity\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pN\u03c4qqs \u201c Eru\u03c4 p0,X\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4pN\u03c4,X\u03c4,0qs and the analysis of the error then follows a usual strategy: the identification of an appropriate continuous time process ` X\u0303\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 such that X\u0303\u03c4 ptnq \u201c X\u03c4,n for all n P N, the use of a telescoping sum argument and of It\u00f4\u2019s formula and of the property that u\u03c4 solves the Kolmogorov equation. Since ` X\u03c4,n \u02d8\nnPN is obtained by applying the (accelerated) exponential\nEuler scheme to the modified SPDE (35), the auxiliary process ` X\u0303\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is chosen such\nthat a single error term (which vanishes if F \u201c 0) appears in the resulting expression of the weak error, which can be treated using Proposition 4.6 above. Note that for all \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 q,\nthe right-hand side of (52) gives a singularity which is integrable. In addition, the form of Proposition 4.6 is consistent with Assumption 5, giving the required regularity condition on the nonlinearity F in order to obtain the order of convergence 1{2.\nThe arguments explained above are only formal, many technical estimates are required to give the proofs of the auxiliary Proposition 4.6 and then of the main Theorem 4.4. The analysis is postponed to Section 6.\nRemark 4.7. The regularity condition on the nonlinearity F in Assumption 5 is used only to obtain the weak rate of convergence 1\n2 in Theorem 4.4. If F only satisfies Assumptions 3, 4\nand 6, the convergence in total variation distance still holds, with order of convergence 1 4 instead of 1 2 : one would get\ndTVp\u00b5\u03c48, \u00b5\u2039q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 4 \u00b4\u03b4.\nSuch a result also shows an improvement over the standard linear Euler scheme, when Assumption 4 is satisfied.\n4.3. Weak error estimates in a general setting. The major result of this article, Theorem 4.4, stated above, gives an error estimate in the total variation distance dTV for the approximation of the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039, which is the invariant distribution of the stochastic evolution equation (21) when Assumption 4 holds. The next result shows that the modified Euler scheme also provides weak error estimates to approximate the distribution \u03c1XpT q of the solution of (21) at arbitary times T P p0,8q, without the requirement that\nAssumptions 3 and 4 are satisfied. However, the weak error estimates below require the functions \u03d5 to be of class C2, equivalently \u03c1X\u03c4\nN approximates \u03c1XpN\u03c4q when \u03c4 \u00d1 0 only in the\nd2 distance. Whether an approximation result in the total variation distance dTV \u201c d0 can be obtained is left open. Note that this would correspond to weaken the regularity of the function \u03d5 in the weak error estimates.\nTheorem 4.8. Let the nonlinearity F satisfy Assumptions 2, 5 and 6. For all T P p0,8q, \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 q and \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4pT q P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 \u201c TN P p0, \u03c40q with\nN P N and all x0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 , one has\n(53) d2p\u03c1X\u03c4 N , \u03c1XpT qq \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4\n1 2 \u00b4\u03b4`1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 \u02d8 .\nMore precisely, for all functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C2 with bounded first and second order derivatives, all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and all N P N, such that T \u201c N\u03c4 , and all x0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 , one has\n(54) \u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4`~\u03d5~1 ` ~\u03d5~2 \u02d8` 1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 \u02d8 .\nWhen Assumption 3 is satisfied, the stochastic evolution equation (21) admits a unique invariant distribution \u00b58 (see Proposition 2.2). The next result provides an error estimate for d2p\u00b5\u03c48, \u00b58q, where \u00b5\u03c48 is the unique invariant distribution of the modified Euler scheme (29) (see Proposition 4.3).\nTheorem 4.9. Let the nonlinearity F satisfy Assumptions 3, 5 and 6. For all \u03b4 P p0, 1 2 q\nand \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q one has (55) d2p\u00b5\u03c48, \u00b58q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4.\nMore precisely, for all \u03b4 P p0, 1 2 q and 0 \u010f \u03ba \u0103 minp 1 1`\u03c40\u03bb1 , logp1`\u03c40\u03bb1q \u03c40\u03bb1 qp\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q P p0, \u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q, there exists C\u03b4,\u03ba P p0,8q such that for all functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C2 with bounded first and second order derivatives, all x0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 , all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and all N P N, such that N\u03c4 \u011b 1, one has\n(56) \u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4,\u03ba ` ~\u03d5~1 ` ~\u03d5~2 \u02d8 \u00b4 \u03c4 1 2\n\u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 q ` e\u00b4\u03baN\u03c4 p1 ` |x0|q \u00af .\nLike for Theorem 4.8, whether an approximation result in the total variation distance, namely an error estimate for dTVp\u00b5\u03c48, \u00b58q, can be obtained is left open. Note that Theorem 4.4 gives a positive answer when Assumption 4 holds.\nLet us now describe the approach to prove Theorem 4.8, more precisely to prove the weak error estimate (54). Similarly to (51), it is convenient to decompose the error as\n(57) Er\u03d5pX\u03c4N qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u201c Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pT qqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs ` Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pT qqs, where ` X\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 denotes the solution of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35), and using the identity Xn,\u03c4 \u201c X\u03c4n for all n P N0, see Section 3.3. Like for the proof of Theorem 4.4, the second term in the right-hand side of (57) is written as\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pT qqs \u201c Eru\u03c4 p0,X\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4 pT,X\u03c4,0qs, where u\u03c4 pt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pX\u03c4ptqqs (see Proposition 4.6). The first term in the right-hand side of (57) may be written as\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4 pT qqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u201c Eru\u03c4 pT,Xp0qqs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4 p0, XpT qqs.\nApplying It\u00f4\u2019s formula, one would need to establish regularity estimates for the first and the second order derivatives Du\u03c4 pt, xq and D2u\u03c4 pt, xq. In order to obtain bounds with constants which do not depend on the time-step size \u03c4 , technical arguments are needed, see the statement of Proposition 4.6 for the first order derivative. To avoid using such technical statements and analysis on the second order derivative, it is more convenient to employ the alternative expression\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4 pT qqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u201c Erup0,X\u03c4pT qqs \u00b4 ErupT,X\u03c4 p0qqs, where upt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pXptqqs, and to use appropriate regularity estimates for the first and second order derivatives Dupt, xq and D2upt, xq to obtain an error estimate when \u03c4 \u00d1 0, see Section 5.6. Note that the requirement to assume that \u03d5 is of class C2 (~\u03d5~2 appears in the weak error estimates) is due to the analysis of the error term Erup0,X\u03c4pT qqs\u00b4ErupT,X\u03c4p0qqs, whereas the treatment of the other error term can be performed using a version of Proposition 4.6 and assuming \u03d5 to be bounded would be sufficient. It is not known whether the regularity condition on \u03d5 may be relaxed.\nRemark that when Assumptions 3 and 4 are satisfied, one has\nlim T\u00d18\n` Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pT qqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u02d8 \u201c 0,\nsince \u00b5\u2039 is the invariant distribution for both stochastic evolution equations (21) and (35) with that restrictive condition on the nonlinearity F (see Propositions 2.2 and 3.3). This observation explains why the regularity condition on \u03d5 can be relaxed in Theorem 4.4.\nIn order to prove Theorem 4.9, it suffices to apply the arguments above with appropriate regularity bounds for the derivatives of the functions u\u03c4 pt, \u00a8q and upt, \u00a8q, to obtain upper bounds depending on expp\u00b4\u03batq. The required bounds will be provided below, however the details of the proof of Theorem 4.9 will be omitted.\nRemark 4.10. The approach presented above to prove Theorems 4.8 and 4.9 exploits the interpretation of the modified Euler scheme in terms of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) explained in Section 3.3. It is possible to prove those results without using that interpretation and using instead the second interpretation (32) of the modified Euler scheme (see Section 3.2), in the spirit of [34] and [12] respectively. Note that these two references do not require Assumption 5. Very similar arguments would be needed to estimates the relevant error terms in the two approaches, however the approach we follow in this work may be simpler to present, and it is worth giving the details of the approach using a modified equation, since it is has not been treated in the literature so far. Our approach may also be used to prove the weak error estimates from [34] and [12] for the standard Euler scheme, which can also be interpreted as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to an appropriate modified stochastic evolution equation, see Section 4.4 below, the details are omitted.\n4.4. Comparison with the standard Euler scheme. In this section, we compare the results stated above concerning the modified Euler scheme (42), with the results obtained for the standard Euler scheme (43).\nLet us first study the qualitative behavior of the schemes. As already mentioned and illustrated in Section 4.1, the standard Euler scheme does not preserve the spatial regularity of the solution of the stochastic evolution equation: Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 do not hold for the standard Euler scheme. Precisely, for any fixed \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and any N P N, X\u03c4,stN takes values in Dp\u039b\u03b1q for all \u03b1 P p0, 1\n2 q, whereas XpN\u03c4q takes values in Dp\u039b\u03b1q if and only if \u03b1 P p0, 1 4 q.\nIn the Gaussian case (F \u201c 0), the distributions \u03c1X\u03c4,st N and \u03c1XpN\u03c4q of the H-valued random variables X\u03c4,stN and XpN\u03c4q are thus singular. The proposed scheme (42) thus overcomes the qualitative limitations of the standard scheme (43).\nIn the ergodic situation, when Assumption 3 is satisfied, an appropriate version of Proposition 4.3 is satisfied for the standard Euler scheme. On the one hand, the scheme admits a unique invariant distribution denoted by \u00b5\u03c4,st8 and variants of the inequalities (46) and (47) hold: see for instance [12]. On the other hand, when F \u201c 0, \u00b5\u03c4,st8 is a Gaussian distribution \u03bd\u03c4 (see Equation (24)), which is not equal to the Gaussian distribution \u03bd. Precisely, for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, \u03bd\u03c4 is the centered Gaussian distribution given by\n(58) \u03bd\u03c4 \u201c N ` 0, 1 2 \u039b\u00b41pI ` \u03c4\u039b 2 q\u00b41 \u02d8 , which is the distribution of the H-valued Gaussian random variable Z\u03c4 \u201c \u0159jPN 2\u03b3j?\n2\u03bbjp2`\u03bbj\u03c4q ej\nwhere ` \u03b3j \u02d8\njPN is a sequence of independent standard real-valued Gaussian random variables.\nConsistently with the discussion above concerning the non-validity of Theorem 4.1 for the standard Euler scheme, the Gaussian distributions \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd are singular for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. In addition, for all \u03c4 \u2030 \u03c4 1 P p0, \u03c40q, the Gaussian distributions \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u03c4 1 are also singular.\nLet us now discuss convergence in distribution of \u03c1X\u03c4,st N to \u03c1XpN\u03c4q, when \u03c4 \u00d1 0 and N\u03c4 \u201c T , and of \u00b5\u03c4,st8 to \u00b58 in the ergodic situation. This question has been studied in the literature: the weak order of convergence of the standard Euler scheme is equal to 1{2. We refer to [34] for a version of Theorem 4.8 and to [12] for a version of Theorem 4.9, for the standard Euler scheme, under weaker assumptions on the nonlinearity F (Assumption 5 is not required in those references). We provide neither precise statements nor elements of proofs of these two results. As already mentioned in Remark 4.10 (Section 4.3), the weak error analysis in [34] and in [12] exploits different decompositions of the errors, and a proof using an interpretation of the standard Euler scheme in terms of a modified equation may also be employed.\nThe remaining question is whether a result of the type of Theorem 4.4 holds for the standard Euler scheme, when Assumption 4 is satisfied for the nonlinearity F . Owing to the discussion above, this is not possible in the case Gaussian case (F \u201c 0), since the Gaussian distributions \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd are singular for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. To state weak error estimates with order of convergence 1{2, it is necessary to assume that the function \u03d5 is of class C2, see [13]. Therefore, the qualitative properties of the scheme have an impact on its quantitative analysis. The proposed modified Euler scheme improves both the qualitative and quantitative properties compared with the standard Euler scheme.\nTo go further in the analysis of the standard Euler scheme, we state the following variant of Theorem 4.4, where the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039 needs to be replaced by the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u03c4\u2039 defined by (59) d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039pxq \u201c pZ\u03c4 q\u00b41e\u00b42V pxqd\u03bd\u03c4 pxq with normalization constant Z\u03c4 \u201c \u015f\ne\u00b42V pxqd\u03bd\u03c4 pxq P p0,8q, where the reference Gaussian distribution is \u03bd\u03c4 defined by (58) (instead of \u03bd). The only but crucial difference in the definitions (25) and (59) is the choice of the reference Gaussian distribution, equal to \u03bd or \u03bd\u03c4 respectively. One has the following result.\nTheorem 4.11. Let the nonlinearity F satisfy Assumptions 3, 4, 5 and 6. Assume also that for all \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all x P H2\u03b4, one has\n(60) |\u039b\u03b4F pxq| \u010f C\u03b4|\u039b2\u03b4x|. For all \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 q and \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q one has\n(61) dTVp\u00b5\u03c4,st8 , \u00b5\u03c4\u2039q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4, where \u00b5\u03c4,st8 is the unique invariant distribution of `\nX\u03c4,stn qn\u011b0 and \u00b5\u03c4\u2039 is given by (25). Moreover, for all \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 q and \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all\nx0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 , all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and N P N, with N\u03c4 \u011b 2\u03c40, and any bounded measurable function \u03d5 P BbpHq, one has\n(62) \u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4~\u03d5~ \u00b4 \u03c4 1 2\n\u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 q ` e\u00b4\u03baN\u03c4 p1 ` |x0|q \u00af ,\nwith \u03ba \u201c logp1`\u03c40\u03bb1q \u03c40\u03bb1 p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q P p0, \u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q. To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 4.11 is a new result. Even if this convergence result has little practical interest since one is interested in the approximation of \u00b5\u2039, not of \u00b5 \u03c4 \u2039, this statement is another illustration of the limitations of the standard Euler scheme (43) and of the superiority of the modified Euler scheme (42). In addition, the proof of Theorem 4.11 is based on the ideas developed to prove Theorem 4.4. Note that when F \u201c 0, one has dTVp\u00b5\u03c4,st8 , \u00b5\u03c4\u2039q \u201c 0, by definition of \u03bd\u03c4 . However, dTVp\u00b5\u03c4\u2039, \u00b5\u2039q \u201c 2, since the distributions \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd are singular.\nThe statement of Theorem 4.11 requires the nonlinearity F to satisfy the additional condition (60). This is not restrictive in practice, since this condition is also satisfied in the framework of Section 2.4.\nLet us explain the strategy of the proof of Theorem 4.11. As already mentioned above, the standard Euler scheme (43) can be interpreted as obtained from the application of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme to a modified stochastic evolution equation. Precisely, for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, introduce the process ` X \u03c4,stptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 which is solution of the modified stochastic evolution equation\n(63) dX \u03c4,stptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4X \u03c4,stptqdt ` Q\u03c4F pX \u03c4,stptqqdt ` R 1 2 \u03c4 dW ptq,\nwith initial value X \u03c4,stp0q \u201c x0, where the linear operators \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 are given by (39), and the linear operator R\u03c4 is given by\n(64) R\u03c4 \u201c Q\u03c4 pI ` \u03c4\u039b 2 q\u00b41.\nThe application of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme to the modified stochastic evolution equation (63) gives\nX \u03c4,st n`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4X \u03c4,stn ` \u039b\u00b41\u03c4 pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 qQ\u03c4F pX \u03c4,stn q `\n\u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4R 1 2 \u03c4 dW psq,\nwith initial value X \u03c4,st0 \u201c x0 \u201c X\u03c4,st0 . It is straightforward to check that the identity \u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b42ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4dsR\u03c4 \u201c \u03c4pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b42 \u201c \u03c4A2\u03c4\nholds for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, using the definitions of \u039b\u03c4 , Q\u03c4 and R\u03c4 . Therefore ` X\u03c4,stn \u02d8\nnPN0 and `\nX \u03c4,stn \u02d8\nnPN0 are equal in distribution. Note that the operators \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 in the modified\nstochastic evolution equation (63) are the same as in the interpretation of the modified Euler scheme (42) in terms of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) developped in Section 3.3, however R\u03c4 \u2030 Q\u03c4 . The invariant distribution of the modified stochastic evolution equation (63) is not known, even if F satisfies Assumption 4 (except when F \u201c 0), contrary to the situation for the modified Euler scheme. To overcome this issue, let us introduce an additional auxiliary process `\nX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0, which is solution of the modified stochastic evolution equation\n(65) dX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4X \u03c4,st\u2039 ptqdt ` R\u03c4F pX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptqqdt ` R 1 2 \u03c4 dW ptq, with initial value X \u03c4,st\u2039 p0q \u201c x0. Compared with (63), the drift Q\u03c4F p\u00a8q is replaced by R\u03c4F p\u00a8q in (65). Thanks to this modification, it is straightforward to check that, when F \u201c \u00b4DV (Assumption 4), the invariant distribution of (65) is equal to the modified Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u03c4\u2039 defined by (59), where the reference measure is the Gaussian distribution \u03bd\n\u03c4 which is invariant when F \u201c 0.\nThe weak error in the left-hand side of (62) can be decomposed as follows (compare with (51) for the analysis of the modified scheme): with the notation tN \u201c N\u03c4 , one has\n(66)\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039 \u201c Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039\n\u201c Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,stptN qs ` Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,stptN qqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptNqs ` Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptN qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039.\nThe next step is the introduction of the auxiliary functions u\u03c4,st and u\u03c4,st\u2039 defined by u\u03c4,stpt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pX \u03c4,stptqqs, u\u03c4,st\u2039 pt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptqqs, for all t \u011b 0 and x P H , which are solutions of the Kolmogorov equation associated with the modified stochastic evolution equations (63) and (65) respectively. The decomposition of the error above may be rewritten as\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039 \u201c Eru\u03c4,stp0,X \u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4,stptN ,X \u03c4,st0 qs\n` Eru\u03c4,st\u2039 p0,X \u03c4,stptNqqs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4,s\u2039 ptN ,X \u03c4,stp0qqs ` Eru\u03c4,s\u2039 ptN , x0qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039.\nFinally, the three error terms in the right-hand side above are studied using regularity properties of the mappings u\u03c4,st and u\u03c4,st\u2039 : versions of Proposition 4.6 hold, see Lemma 8.4 in Section 8.2. In particular, assuming that \u03d5 is bounded and continuous is sufficient to prove the weak error estimate with order 1{2.\nThe tools in the proof of Theorem 4.11 are similar to those employed in the proof of Theorem 4.4, with a few differences, due to the presence of the linear operator R\u03c4 and R 1 2 \u03c4 instead of Q\u03c4 and Q 1 2 \u03c4 in the auxiliary modified equations. We refer to Section 8 for the\nstatements of the required auxiliary results and the proof of Theorem 4.11. Some proofs are omitted to avoid repeating the same arguments as in Section 5, however the main new and non trivial arguments are treated carefully.\nThe results of this section show that the modified Euler scheme (42) proposed in this article is a substantial improvement of the standard Euler scheme (43), both qualitatively and quantitatively. In practice, the cost of each iteration of the modified Euler scheme is more expensive, but the computations are of the same type as for the standard Euler scheme, except for an additional step which requires a Cholesky decomposition. However, the gain provided by the proposed scheme is huge: the properties of the standard scheme cannot be improved by reducing the time-step size.\n4.5. Comparison with the exponential Euler scheme. In this section, we state new weak error estimates for the (accelerated) exponential Euler scheme defined by (44) above. Compared with existing results in the literature, the error between the distributions X\u03c4,eN and XpT q is considered in the total variation distance dTV, instead of the distance d2. The order of convergence is equal to 1{2. This means that it is not necessary to assume that the function \u03d5 is of class C2 (or C1) to obtain a weak error estimate for Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,eN qs\u00b4Er\u03d5pXpT qqs. Compared with the results stated above for the modified Euler scheme in Section 4.2 and 4.3, the approximation in the total variation distance holds at any time T P p0,8q, and for the invariant distribution without Assumption 4.\nTheorem 4.12. Let the nonlinearity F satisfy Assumptions 2, 5 and 6. For all T P p0,8q, \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 q and \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4pT q P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 \u201c TN P p0, \u03c40q\nwith N P N and all x0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 2 , one has\n(67) dTVp\u03c1X\u03c4,e N , \u03c1XpT qq \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4\n1 2 \u00b4\u03b4`1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 \u02d8 .\nMore precisely, for all bounded and measurable functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R, all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and all N P N, such that T \u201c N\u03c4 , and all x0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 , one has (68) \u02c7\n\u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,eN qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4~\u03d5~ ` 1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 \u02d8 q.\nWhen Assumption 3 is satisfied, the exponential Euler scheme (44) admits a unique invariant distribution denoted by \u00b5\u03c4,e8 , and one obtains the following result for the approximation of the invariant distribution \u00b58.\nTheorem 4.13. Let the nonlinearity F satisfy Assumptions 3, 5 and 6. For all \u03b4 P p0, 1 2 q\nand \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q one has (69) d0p\u00b5\u03c4,e8 , \u00b58q \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4. More precisely, for all bounded and measurable functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 Rs, all x0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 , all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and all N P N, such that N\u03c4 \u011b 1, one has\n(70) \u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,eN qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4~\u03d5~ \u00b4 \u03c4 1 2\n\u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 q ` e\u00b4\u03baN\u03c4 p1 ` |x0|q \u00af ,\nwith \u03ba \u201c LF \u00b4 \u03bb1. The proof of Theorem 4.12 is given in Section 7. The proof of Theorem 4.13 is omitted, since it only requires standard additional arguments compared with the proof of Theorem 4.12.\nNote that Theorem 4.1 obviously holds when using the accelerated exponential Euler scheme (44). Indeed, if F \u201c 0, then X\u03c4,eN \u201c W\u039bpN\u03c4q \u201c XpN\u03c4q for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and N P N. Theorem 4.2 is also verified for that integrator, the details are omitted.\nThe modified Euler scheme (42) proposed in this article shares qualitative and quantitative properties with the accelerated exponential Euler scheme (44), with a major practical difference: it is not needed to compute exponentials of the type e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b, instead one only needs to compute LU and Cholesky decompositions. This may be of interest in some situations where using exponential integrators may not be possible.\n5. Auxiliary results\nThis section is devoted to state and prove the auxiliary results which are required to prove the main results of this article stated in Section 4. Additional results will be required in Sections 7 and 8, they will be studied later since they are not required for the analysis of the modified Euler scheme.\nSection 5.1 gives several properties of the linear operators \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 appearing in the interpretation (37) of the modified Euler scheme in terms of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35). Properties of the so-called modified stochastic convolution process are studied in Section 5.2. Then well-posedness, moment bounds and long-time behavior of the modified equation are studied in Section 5.3. The most original and important results of this section deal with the regularity properties of the solutions of the Kolmogorov equations associated with the modified equation (35), with a careful analysis of the dependence in the bounds with respect to the time-step size \u03c4 , see Section 5.4. Those results are combined to give a proof of Proposition 4.6 in Section 6.1. Then, several results concerning the modified Euler scheme (moment bounds, invariant distribution) are given in Section 5.5. Finally, Section 5.6 is devoted to regularity properties of the solutions of the Kolmogorov equation associated with the original stochastic evolution equation (21).\n5.1. Properties of the auxiliary linear operators. Lemma 5.1 below states several bounds on the linear operators Q\u03c4 , \u039b\u03c4 and e\n\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 , which are uniform with respect to the time-step size \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, with arbitrary \u03c40 P p0, 1q. Then Lemma 5.2 gives error estimates for Q\u03c4 \u00b4 Q and \u039b\u03c4 \u00b4 \u039b when \u03c4 \u00d1 0, in an appropriate sense.\nRecall that \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 are defined by (39), and that\u039b\u03c4ej \u201c \u03bb\u03c4,jej and Q\u03c4ej \u201c q\u03c4,jej , for all j P N, with the eigenvalues \u03bb\u03c4,j and q\u03c4,j given by (38), see Section 3.3.\nThe first result of this section is Lemma 5.1.\nLemma 5.1. Let \u03c40 P p0, 1q. The linear operator Q\u03c4 is bounded, and for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q one has\n(71) }Q\u03c4}LpHq \u201c 1 ` logp\u03c4\u03bb1q\n\u03c4\u03bb1 \u010f 1.\nMoreover, one has the following spectral gap inequality for the self-adjoint unbounded linear operators \u039b\u03c4 : for all x P DpAq and all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, one has\n(72) x\u039b\u03c4x, xy \u011b logp1 ` \u03c40\u03bb1q\n\u03c40 |x|2.\nFor all \u03b1 P r0, 1q, the semigroup ` e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 \u02d8\nt\u011b0 satisfies the following properties:\nsup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup tPp0,8q\n}e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 }LpHq \u010f 1,(73)\nsup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup tPp\u03c4,8q\npt \u00b4 \u03c4q\u03b1}\u039b\u03b1e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 }LpHq \u0103 8,(74)\nsup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup tPp0,\u03c4q\n\u03c4\u03b1}\u039b\u03b1e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4 }LpHq \u0103 8,(75)\nsup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q\n}Q\u00b4 1 2 \u03c4 e \u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 }LpHq \u0103 8,(76)\nsup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup tPp0,8q\nt\u00b4\u03b1}\u039b\u00b4\u03b1pI \u00b4 e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 q}LpHq \u0103 8.(77)\nThe inequalities (74) and (75) are a form of the smoothing inequality (16). To obtain bounds which are uniform with respect to the time-step size \u03c4 , it is necessary to treat separately the cases t P p0, \u03c40q and t P p\u03c4,8q: indeed, for all 0 \u0103 \u03b1 \u0103 \u03b11 \u010f 1, \u039b\u03b1 1 e\u00b4\u03b1\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 \u201c \u039b\u03b11pI ` \u03c4\u039bq\u00b4\u03b1 is not a bounded operator, for any value of \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, therefore the inequality (74) requires the condition t \u0105 \u03c4 . A naive and simpler form of the smoothing inequality holds: one has\nsup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup tPp0,8q\nt\u03b1}\u039b\u03b1\u03c4 e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 }LpHq \u0103 8.\nHowever the linear operators \u039b\u03b1\u03c4 and \u039b \u03b1 \u03c4 define norms |\u039b\u03b1\u03c4 \u00a8 | and |\u039b\u03b1 \u00a8 | which are not equivalent. This is why the smoothing inequality (74) and (75) are needed. The second result of this section is Lemma 5.2.\nLemma 5.2. Let \u03c40 P p0, 1q.

The proof of (73) is straight-\nforward: for all j P N and all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, one has \u03bb\u03c4,j \u011b 0.

Properties of the modified stochastic convolution.

This process plays a crucial role in the analysis. On the one hand, this is the solution of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) with initial value X\u03c4 p0q \u201c 0 when F \u201c 0. Calling the process ` W\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is consistent with the usual terminology, such that\nthe process ` W\u039b\u03c4 ptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 defined by (23) is referred to as the stochastic convolution and is solution of the original stochastic evolution equation (21) with initial value Xp0q \u201c 0 and F \u201c 0. On the other hand, one has the following equality: for all n P N0, W\u03c4 ptnq \u201c W \u03c4n , where W \u03c4n is defined by (45) and tn \u201c n\u03c4 . That equality (in distribution) is due to the third interpretation of the modified Euler scheme, as the accelerated exponential Euler method applied to the modified equation (35).\nUsing the properties from Lemma 5.1 above, the following moment bounds are obtained for the modified stochastic convolution, with bounds independent on \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q.\nLemma 5.3. For all \u03c40 P p0, 1q and all \u03b1 P r0, 14q, one has (82) sup\n\u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup t\u011b0\nEr|W\u03c4 ptq|2\u03b1s \u0103 8.\nNote that Lemma 5.3 is instrumental Sections 5.3 and 5.5 below.\nProof of Lemma 5.3.

Since \u0159 jPN 1 2\u03bb1\u00b42\u03b1j \u0103 8 if and only if \u03b1 P r0, 1 4 q, this concludes the proof of the inequality (82) and of Lemma 5.3.\n5.3. Analysis of the modified equation. Using Lemma 5.1, it is now straightforward to justify the well-posedness of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35), and to prove the existence and uniqueness of an invariant distribution \u00b5\u03c4,8 when the ergodicity condition (Assumption 3) is satisfied.\nProposition 5.4. Let Assumptions 1 and 2 be satisfied, and let the linear operators \u039b\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 be defined by (39), for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q.\nFor any initial value x0 P H, the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) admits a unique mild solution ` X\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 satisfying (36), with X\u03c4 p0q \u201c x0. In addition, for all T P p0,8q and all \u03b1 P r0, 1\n4 q, one has\n(83) sup x0PH\u03b1 sup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup tPr0,T s Er|X\u03c4 ptq|2\u03b1s 1 ` |x0|2\u03b1 \u0103 8.\nMoreover, if Assumption 3 is satisfied, the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) admits a unique invariant distribution \u00b5\u03c4,8, which satisfies\n(84) sup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q\n\u017c\n|x|2\u03b1d\u00b5\u03c4,8 \u0103 8.\nfor all \u03b1 P r0, 1 4 q. In addition, if Assumption 3 is satisfied, the moment bound (83) is uniform with respect to T P p0,8q: one has\n(85) sup x0PH\u03b1 sup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup t\u011b0 Er|X\u03c4 ptq|2\u03b1s 1 ` |x0|2\u03b1 \u0103 8.\nFinally, there exists C P p0,8q, such that for all functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C1, for all x0 P H, for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and for all t \u011b 0, one has\n(86) \u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 ptqqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4,8 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C~\u03d5~1e\u00b4\u03batp1 ` |x0|q,\nwith \u03ba \u201c logp1`\u03c40\u03bb1q \u03c40\u03bb1 p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q P p0, \u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q. Note that Proposition 5.4 is a refinement of Proposition 3.2, with bounds which are uniform with respect to \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. Proof of Proposition 5.4. First, the existence and uniqueness of the mild solution `\nX\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 satisfying (36) follows from a straightforward fixed point argument, which is\nomitted (see the discussion before the statement of Proposition 3.2). Let us now establish the properties of the mild solution.\nAssume first that \u03b1 \u201c 0. The mild formulation (36) can be written as\nX\u03c4 ptq \u201c e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4x0 ` \u017c t\n0\ne\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4F pX\u03c4psqqds ` W\u03c4 ptq,\nwhere W\u03c4 ptq is the modified stochastic convolution given by (81). Owing to the global Lipschitz continuity of F and to the inequalities (73) and (71), the application of Minkowskii\u2019s inequality and of the It\u00f4 isometry formula yields\n` Er|X\u03c4 ptq|2s \u02d8 1 2 \u010f |x0|2 ` C \u017c t\n0\n` Er|X\u03c4 psq|2s \u02d8 1 2ds ` ` Er|W\u03c4 ptq|2s \u02d8 1 2 ,\nwhere C does not depend on \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. Using the moment bound (82) from Lemma 5.3 and applying Gronwall\u2019s lemma then gives\nsup x0PH sup \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q sup tPr0,T s Er|X\u03c4 ptq|2s 1 ` |x0|2 \u0103 8.\nWhen \u03b1 P p0, 1 4 q, one obtains the inequality\n` Er|X\u03c4 ptq|2\u03b1s \u02d8 1 2 \u010f |x0|2\u03b1 ` C\n\u017c t\n0\n}\u039b\u03b1e\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4}LpHq ` Er|X\u03c4 psq|2s \u02d8 1 2ds ` ` Er|W\u03c4 ptq|2\u03b1s \u02d8 1 2 .\nUsing the smoothing inequalities (74) and (75), one obtains for all t P r0, T s \u017c t\n0\n}\u039b\u03b1e\u00b4s\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4}LpHqds \u010f \u017c \u03c4\n0\n}\u039b\u03b1e\u00b4s\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4}LpHqds ` 1t\u0105\u03c4 \u017c t\n\u03c4\n}\u039b\u03b1e\u00b4s\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4}LpHqds\n\u010f C\u03b1\u03c4 1\u00b4\u03b1 ` C\u03b1 \u017c T\n0\ns\u00b4\u03b1ds \u010f C\u03b1pT q,\nwhere C\u03b1pT q P p0,8q for all \u03b1 P r0, 1q. Using the moment bound (82) with \u03b1 P p0, 14q and the moment bound for X\u03c4 ptq when \u03b1 \u201c 0 above then concludes the proof of the inequality (83).\nLet us now assume that Assumption 3 is satisfied. Let x10 P H and x20 P H be two arbitrary initial values, and introduce the auxiliary processes defined by\nX i\u03c4 ptq \u201c e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4xi0 ` \u017c t\n0\ne\u00b4pt\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q\u03c4F pX i\u03c4 psqqds ` W\u03c4 ptq\nY i\u03c4 ptq \u201c X i\u03c4 ptq \u00b4 W\u03c4 ptq,\nfor i \u201c 1, 2.

In addition, one has\ninf \u03c4Pp0,\u03c40q logp1 ` \u03c4\u03bb1q \u03c4\u03bb1 \u201c logp1 ` \u03c40\u03bb1q \u03c40\u03bb1 .\nApplying Gronwall\u2019s lemma, one obtains the inequality\n|X 2\u03c4 ptq \u00b4 X 1\u03c4 ptq| \u010f e\u00b4\u03bat|x20 \u00b4 x10|\nwith \u03ba \u201c logp1`\u03c40\u03bb1q \u03c40\u03bb1 p\u03bb1\u00b4LF q P p0, \u03bb1\u00b4LF q. A similar argument yields the uniform bound (85), the details are omitted.\nFinally, the proof of the existence and uniqueness of the invariant distribution \u00b5\u03c4,8, which satisfies the bound (84), and the proof of the inequality (86), are standard and the details are omitted.\nThis concludes the proof of Proposition 5.4.\n5.4. Kolmogorov equation associated with the modified equation. The objective of this section is to state and prove regularity results for the functions u\u03c4 defined by\n(87) u\u03c4 pt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pX\u03c4ptqqs,\nfor all t \u011b 0, x P H , and \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, where \u03d5 is a bounded and continuous function from H to R. In the above definition, ` X\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is the unique solution of the modified stochastic\nevolution equation (35), with initial value X\u03c4 p0q \u201c x. To study the regularity properties of the function u\u03c4 , it is convenient to rely on the convention introduced in Section 2.7: recall that an auxiliary finite dimensional approximation is applied, in order to justify the regularity properties and the computations, and all the upper bounds do not depend on the auxiliary discretization parameter, which is omitted to simplify the notation.\nIt is convenient to introduce the family of linear operators ` P\u03c4,t \u02d8 t\u011b0, such that u\u03c4 pt, \u00a8q \u201c P\u03c4,t\u03d5p\u00a8q for all t \u011b 0. The Markov property for the solutions of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) yields the semigroup property: for all t, s \u011b 0 and all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, one has\n(88) P\u03c4,t`s\u03d5 \u201c P\u03c4,t ` P\u03c4,s\u03d5 \u02d8 ,\nfor any \u03d5 P BbpHq. Under appropriate regularity conditions on the function \u03d5, the function pt, xq P R`\u02c6H \u00de\u00d1 u\u03c4 pt, xq \u201c P\u03c4,t\u03d5pxq is solution of the Kolmogorov equation\n(89) Btu\u03c4 \u201c L\u03c4u\u03c4 with initial value u\u03c4 p0, \u00a8q \u201c \u03d5, where the infinitesimal generator L\u03c4 of the modified stochastic evolution equation (35) is defined by\nL\u03c4\u03c6pxq \u201c D\u03c6pxq. ` \u00b4\u039b\u03c4x ` Q\u03c4F pxq \u02d8 ` 1 2 \u00ff\njPN D2\u03c6pxq.pQ\n1 2 \u03c4 ej , Q 1 2 \u03c4 ejq.\nGiving a meaning to L\u03c4\u03c6pxq above in a finite dimensional framework only requires to assume that \u03c6 is twice differentiable. However, since \u039b\u03c4 is an unbounded linear operator, obtaining a bound independent of the auxiliary finite dimensional approximation parameter requires an additional condition on D\u03c6pxq. Observe that Q\u03c4 is an Hilbert\u2013Schmidt linear operator for any positive \u03c4 , so no condition on D2\u03c6pxq is needed. To obtain bounds which are also uniform with respect to the time-step size parameter \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, precise upper bounds on Du\u03c4pt, \u00a8q and Du2\u03c4 pt, \u00a8q are needed. It turns out that to prove Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.8 in Section 6, the second order derivative Du2\u03c4pt, xq never appeats in the expressions of the weak error. Therefore we only need to state and prove suitable regularity results for the first order derivative Du\u03c4pt, xq. Three lemmas are stated below, and combining the three results using the semigroup property (88) provides additional results: see the proof of Proposition 4.6 in Section 6.1.\nLet us now state and prove the three lemmas concerning properties of the first order derivative Du\u03c4pt, xq. It is challenging and crucial to obtain upper bounds which are uniform with respect to \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. This requires to use the properties stated in Lemma 5.1 on the semigroup ` e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4 \u02d8\nt\u011b0. The arguments used to prove the three lemmas are also employed in Section 5.6 below, with simpler formulations since the parameter \u03c4 does not appear there.\nTwo expressions for Du\u03c4pt, xq.h are employed below in the proofs. On the one hand, if u\u03c4 p0, \u00a8q \u201c \u03d5 is of class C1 with bounded derivative, one has (90) Du\u03c4 pt, xq.h \u201c ExrD\u03d5pX\u03c4ptqq.\u03b7h\u03c4 ptqs, where `\n\u03b7h\u03c4 ptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 is solution of\n(91) d\u03b7h\u03c4 ptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4\u03b7h\u03c4 ptqdt ` Q\u03c4DF pX h\u03c4 ptqq.\u03b7h\u03c4 ptqdt, with initial value \u03b7h\u03c4 p0q \u201c h, see for instance [24, Chapter 4]. On the other hand, if u\u03c4 p0, \u00a8q \u201c \u03d5 is only assumed to be bounded and continuous, one has\n(92) Du\u03c4pt, xq.h \u201c 1\nt Exr\u03d5pX\u03c4ptqq\n\u017c t\n0\nxQ\u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 \u03b7 h \u03c4 psq, dW psqys.\nThe expression (92) is given by a Bismut\u2013Elworthy type formula, see for instance [24, Equation (4.0.2)] or [32, Lemma 7.1.3]. The validity of the expressions 90 and (92) is easily checked in the finite dimensional approximation setting (Section 2.7).\nOn the one hand, Lemmas 5.5 and 5.6 require \u03d5 to be of class C1 and thus use the expression (90). On the other hand, Lemma 5.7 uses the expression (92) since it gives an upper bound in terms of ~\u03d5~0. In the proofs of the three auxiliary lemmas below, we only focus on proving upper bounds with constants independent of the time-step size \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q.\nLemma 5.5. Let Assumptions 1, 2 and 6 be satisfied. For all t \u011b 0, all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and all \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C1, u\u03c4pt, \u00a8q is of class C1, with (93) ~u\u03c4pt, \u00a8q~1 \u010f eLF t~\u03d5~1.

Without loss of generality, it may be assumed that T \u0105 \u03c4 . Assumption 6 ensures the well-posedness of \u03b7h\u03c4 ptq and differentiability of u\u03c4 pt, \u00a8q for all t \u011b 0.\nProof of Lemma 5.5.

Applying Gronwall\u2019s lemma then gives |\u03b7h\u03c4 ptq| \u010f eLF t|h| and the inequality (93) follows from the expression (90).\nIn order to prove the inequality (94), let us introduce an auxiliary process defined by\n(95) \u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq \u201c \u03b7h\u03c4 ptq \u00b4 e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4h for all t \u011b 0. Using the expression (90), one obtains\n|Du\u03c4pt, xq.h| \u010f ~\u03d5~1|e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4h| ` ~\u03d5~1 ` Exr|\u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq|2s \u02d8 1 2 .\nOn the one hand, owing to the smoothing inequality (74), one has |e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4h| \u010f C\u03b1pt \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b4\u03b1|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1h| for all t \u0105 \u03c4 . On the other hand, the auxiliary process `\n\u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 solves the evolution equation\n(96) d\u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq dt \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4 \u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq ` Q\u03c4DF pX\u03c4 ptqq.\u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq ` Q\u03c4DF pX\u03c4ptqq.e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4h,\nwith initial value \u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 p0q \u201c 0.

Gathering the estimates then concludes the proof of the inequality (94) and of Lemma 5.5.\nLemma 5.6. Let Assumptions 1, 2 and 6 be satisfied. For all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and all \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C1, one has, for all t \u011b 0,\n(97) ~u\u03c4 pt, \u00a8q~1 \u010f e\u00b4\u03bat~\u03d5~1 with \u03ba \u201c logp1`\u03c40\u03bb1q\n\u03c40\u03bb1 p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q \u0105 0.\nProof of Lemma 5.6.

Therefore |\u03b7h\u03c4 ptq| \u010f e\u00b4\u03bat|h| for all t \u011b 0, and then the inequality (97) is a straightforward consequence of the expression (90). This concludes the proof of Lemma 5.6.\nLemma 5.7. Let Assumptions 1, 2, 3 and 6 be satisfied. For all \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, all t P p\u03c4,8q, and all \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C0, u\u03c4 pt, \u00a8q is of class C1, and one has, for all t P p\u03c4,8q and all x, h P H,\n(98) ~u\u03c4 pt, \u00a8q~1 \u010f C\npt \u00b4 \u03c4q 12 ~\u03d5~0.\nMoreover, for all t P p0,8q, all x P H and all h P DpQ\u00b4 1 2 \u03c4 q, one has\n(99) |DP\u03c4,t\u03d5pxq.h| \u201c |Du\u03c4pt, xq.h| \u010f ~\u03d5~0?\nt |Q\u00b4 1 2 \u03c4 h|.\nNote that Lemma 5.7 is a crucial ingredient to establish the main result of this work, Theorem 4.4, where the error between the invariant distributions \u00b5\u03c48 and \u00b58 \u201c \u00b5\u2039 (when Assumption 4 is satisfied) is considered using the total variation distance dTV, see Equation (48). Assumption 3 may be removed, the constant C would then depend on the final time T P p0,8q with a condition t P p\u03c4, T s. The result used to prove Theorem 4.4 is Proposition 4.6, which is proved below by a combination of Lemmas 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7, which all serve different purposes: having estimates in terms of |\u039b\u00b4\u03b1h| with \u03b1 P p0, 1\n2 q, in terms of expp\u00b4\u03batq\nwith \u03ba \u0105 0 and in terms of ~\u03d5~0. The inequality (99) is a first step to prove (98) and is also employed to deal with some of the error terms in the weak error analysis below. Note that Q \u00b4 1 2 \u03c4 is an unbounded linear operator, therefore to obtain the inequality (98) (which requires a bound with |h| on the right-hand side) one needs an additional argument. Like the proof of Lemma 5.5, one needs to be careful to obtain constants which are independent of \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, this explains why the quantity pt \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b41{2 appears in the right-hand side of (98).\nProof of Lemma 5.7. Recall the identity Q\u00b41\u03c4 \u039b\u03c4 \u201c \u039b. Then, for all t \u011b 0 and all h P H , one obtains\n1\n2 d|Q\u00b41{2\u03c4 \u03b7h\u03c4 ptq|2 dt \u201c \u00b4x\u039b\u03b7h\u03c4 ptq, \u03b7hptqy ` xDF pX\u03c4,tq.\u03b7h\u03c4 ptq, \u03b7h\u03c4 ptqy\n\u010f \u00b4\u03bb1|\u03b7h\u03c4 ptq|2 ` LF |\u03b7h\u03c4 ptq|2 \u010f 0,\nusing Assumption 3. Therefore, for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, t \u011b 0 and h P H , one has\n|Q\u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 \u03b7 h \u03c4 ptq| \u010f |Q\n\u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 h|. Using It\u00f4\u2019s isometry formula and the expression (92) of Du\u03c4pt, xq.h, one then obtains the upper bound (99), for all t P p0,8q. As explained above, an additional argument is required to prove (98) and remove the unbounded operator Q \u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 on the right-hand side. Let now t \u0105 \u03c4 . The semigroup property (88) yields the identity\nu\u03c4pt, \u00a8q \u201c P\u03c4,\u03c4 ` P\u03c4,t\u00b4\u03c4\u03d5 \u02d8 ,\nand using the expression (90) gives the equality\nDu\u03c4pt, xq.h \u201c ExrDP\u03c4,t\u00b4\u03c4\u03d5pX\u03c4 ptqq.\u03b7h\u03c4 p\u03c4qs.\nApplying the inequality (99) then gives\n|Du\u03c4pt, xq.h| \u010f ~\u03d5~0? t \u00b4 \u03c4 Exr|Q \u00b4 1 2 \u03c4 \u03b7 h \u03c4 p\u03c4q|s.\nIt remains to check that there exists C P p0,8q such that |Q\u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 \u03b7h\u03c4 p\u03c4q| \u010f C|h|2 for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and h P H . Recall that \u03b7h\u03c4 p\u03c4q \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4h ` \u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 p\u03c4q, see (95). On the one hand, one has |Q\u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4h| \u010f C|h| for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, owing to the inequality (76) from Lemma 5.1. On the other hand, using (96) and the identity Q\u00b41\u03c4 \u039b\u03c4 \u201c \u039b, one obtains for all t \u011b 0\n1\n2\nd|Q\u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 \u03b7\u0302 h \u03c4 ptq|2\ndt \u201c \u00b4x\u039b\u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq, \u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptqy ` xDF pX\u03c4ptqq.\u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq, \u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptqy ` xDF pX\u03c4ptqq.e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4h, \u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptqy\n\u010f \u00b4p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q|\u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq|2 ` LF |e\u00b4t\u039b\u03c4h||\u03b7\u0302h\u03c4 ptq| \u010f C|h|2,\nusing the inequality (73) and Young\u2019s inequality.

Properties of the modified Euler scheme. Recall that the modified Euler scheme can be interpreted in three different ways: see (29), (32) and (37) in Section 3. Let us first provide moment bounds, using the second formulation (32) of the scheme.\nLemma 5.8. Let Assumptions 1 and 2 be satisfied.

Introduce the auxiliary random variables\nY \u03c4n \u201c X\u03c4n \u00b4 W \u03c4n , where W \u03c4n is defined by (45), and recall that W \u03c4 n \u201c W\u03c4 ptnq. Therefore, X\u03c4n \u201c Y \u03c4n ` W \u03c4n for all n P N0.

The inequality (107) is obtained using a similar argument. The details are omitted. This concludes the proof of Lemma 5.9.\nTo conclude this section, it remains to provide the proof of Proposition 4.3. Like for the proof of Proposition 5.4, some standard details are omitted.\nProof of Proposition 4.3. The objective is to prove the existence and the uniqueness of the invariant distribution \u00b5\u03c4,8 of the modified Euler scheme, when Assumption 3 is satisfied. In this proof, we use the second interpretation (32) of the scheme. Note that the inequality (108) obtained above ensures the existence of an invariant distribution by the Krylov\u2013Bogoliubov criterion, and also gives the bound (46). It thus suffices to check the uniqueness of the invariant distribution and the inequality (47).\nLet x10 P H and x20 P H be two arbitrary initial values, and introduce the processes defined by\nX \u03c4,i n`1 \u201c A\u03c4X\u03c4,in ` \u03c4A\u03c4F pX\u03c4,in q ` ? \u03c4B\u03c4\u0393n\nfor i \u201c 1, 2. For all n P N, one has and X\u03c4,2n \u00b4 X\u03c4,1n \u201c A\u03c4 ` X \u03c4,2 n\u00b41 \u00b4 X\u03c4,1n\u00b41 \u02d8 ` \u03c4A\u03c4 ` F pX\u03c4,2n\u00b41q \u00b4 F pX\u03c4,1n\u00b41q \u02d8 .\nUsing the inequality }A\u03c4}LpHq and the definition of LF (see Assumption 2), one obtains for all n P N\n|X\u03c4,2n \u00b4 X\u03c4,1n | \u010f 1 ` \u03c4LF 1 ` \u03c4\u03bb1 |X\u03c4,2n\u00b41 \u00b4 X\u03c4,1n\u00b41| \u010f `1 ` \u03c4LF 1 ` \u03c4\u03bb1 \u02d8n|x20 \u00b4 x10|.\nWhen Assumption 3 is satisfied, 1`\u03c4LF 1`\u03c4\u03bb1 \u0103 1 for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, one obtains the uniqueness of the invariant distribution \u00b5\u03c48. Finally, to obtain the inequality (47), it suffices to use the upper bound\n1 ` \u03c4LF 1 ` \u03c4\u03bb1 \u201c 1 \u00b4 \u03c4p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q 1 ` \u03c4\u03bb1 \u010f exp ` \u00b4\u03c4p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q 1 ` \u03c4\u03bb1 \u02d8 \u010f exp ` \u00b4\u03c4p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q 1 ` \u03c40\u03bb1 \u02d8 .\nThis concludes the proof of Proposition 4.3.\n5.6. Kolmogorov equation associated with the original equation. The objective of this section is to state and prove regularity results for the function u defined by\n(109) upt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pXptqqs, for all t \u011b 0, x P H , where \u03d5 is a bounded and continuous function from H to R. In the above definition, ` Xptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is the unique solution of the stochastic evolution equation (21), with\ninitial value Xp0q \u201c x. Like in Section 5.4 above, to study the regularity properties of the function u, it is convenient to rely on the convention introduced in Section 2.7. An auxiliary finite dimensional approximation is applied, in order to justify the regularity properties and the computations, and all the upper bounds do not depend on the auxiliary discretization parameter, which is omitted to simplify the notation.\nNote that the results in this section are not required to prove Theorem 4.4, but they are needed to prove Theorem 4.8. The regularity results are proved using arguments similar to those used in Section 5.4, however they are sometimes simpler since the additional parameter \u03c4 is absent.\nIt is convenient to introduce the family of linear operators ` Pt \u02d8 t\u011b0, such that upt, \u00a8q \u201c Pt\u03d5p\u00a8q for all t \u011b 0. The Markov property for the solutions of the stochastic evolution equation (21) yields the semigroup property: for all t, s \u011b 0, one has (110) Pt`s\u03d5 \u201c Pt ` Ps\u03d5 \u02d8 ,\nfor any \u03d5 P BbpHq. Under appropriate regularity conditions on the function \u03d5, the function pt, xq P R`\u02c6H \u00de\u00d1 upt, xq \u201c Pt\u03d5pxq is solution of the Kolmogorov equation (111) Btu \u201c Lu with initial value up0, \u00a8q \u201c \u03d5, where the infinitesimal generator L of the stochastic evolution equation (21) is defined by\nL\u03c6pxq \u201c D\u03c6pxq. ` \u00b4\u039bx ` F pxq \u02d8 ` 1 2 \u00ff\njPN D2\u03c6pxq.pej , ejq.\nLike for L\u03c4\u03c6pxq in Section 5.4, giving a meaning to L\u03c6pxq in a finite dimensional context only requires to assume that \u03c6 is of class C2. However, to obtain bounds which are independent of the auxiliary spatial discretization parameter, appropriate estimates are needed to deal with the terms D\u03c6pxq \u00a8\u039bx (since \u039b is an unbounded operator) and also \u0159jPN D2\u03c6pxq.pej , ejq.\nLike for Du\u03c4pt, xq.h in Section 5.4 above, two expressions for Dupt, xq.h are employed below in the proofs. On the one hand, if up0, \u00a8q \u201c \u03d5 is of class C1 with bounded derivative, one has\n(112) Dupt, xq.h \u201c ExrD\u03d5pXptqq.\u03b7hptqs, where ` \u03b7hptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is solution of\n(113) d\u03b7hptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03b7hptqdt ` DF pXhptqq.\u03b7hptqdt, with initial value \u03b7hp0q \u201c h, see for instance [24, Chapter 4]. On the other hand, if up0, \u00a8q \u201c \u03d5 is only assumed to be bounded and continuous, one has\n(114) Dupt, xq.h \u201c 1 t Exr\u03d5pXptqq\n\u017c t\n0\nx\u03b7hpsq, dW psqys.\nThe expression (114) is given by a Bismut\u2013Elworthy type formula, see for instance [24, Equation (4.0.2)] or [32, Lemma 7.1.3]. The validity of the expressions 90 and (92) is easily checked in the finite dimensional approximation setting (Section 2.7).\nIn addition, if up0, \u00a8q \u201c \u03d5 is of class C2 with bounded first and second order derivatives, one has\n(115) D2upt, xq.ph1, h2q \u201c ExrD\u03d5pXptqq.\u03b6h1,h2ptqs ` ExrD2\u03d5pXtqq.p\u03b7h1ptq, \u03b7h2ptqqs where ` \u03b6h1,h2ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is solution of\n(116) d\u03b6h1,h2ptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03b6h1,h2ptqdt ` DF pXptqq.\u03b6h1,h2ptqdt ` D2F pXptqq.p\u03b7h1ptq, \u03b7h2ptqqdt, with initial value \u03b6h1,h2p0q \u201c 0, see for instance [24, Chapter 4].\nLemma 5.10 requires \u03d5 to be of class C2 and thus uses the expressions (112) and (115). Similarly, Lemma 5.11 requires \u03d5 to be of class C1 and thus uses the expression (112). Finally, Lemma 5.12 uses the expression (114) since it gives an upper bound in terms of ~\u03d5~0. The proofs are standard, details are provided for completeness and for comparison with the results in Section 5.4. Note also that the three results below may be combined using the semigroup property (110), see Sections 6 and 7 for details.\nLemma 5.10. Let Assumptions 1, 2 and 6 be satisfied. For all T P p0,8q and all \u03b1 P r0, 1q, there exists C\u03b1pT q P p0,8q, such that for all \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C1 with bounded derivative, for all t P p0, T s and all x, h P H, one has (117) |Dupt, xq.h| \u010f C\u03b1pT q~\u03d5~1t\u00b4\u03b1|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1h|, Moreover, for all T P p0,8q and all \u03b11, \u03b12 P r0, 1q such that \u03b11 ` \u03b12 \u0103 1, there exists C\u03b11,\u03b12pT q P p0,8q, such that for all \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C2 with bounded first and second order derivatives, one has\n(118) |D2upt, xq.ph1, h2q| \u010f C\u03b11,\u03b12pT q ` ~\u03d5~1 ` ~\u03d5~2 \u02d8 t\u00b4\u03b11\u00b4\u03b12 |\u039b\u00b4\u03b11h1||\u039b\u00b4\u03b12h2|.\nProof of Lemma 5.10. Let \u03d5 be of class C1 with bounded derivative and T P p0,8q. Then using the expression (112) gives\n|Dupt, xq.h| \u010f ~\u03d5~1Exr|\u03b7hptq|s,\nfor all t \u011b 0 and x, h P H .

As a consequence the inequality (117) holds when \u03b1 \u201c 0. To deal with the case \u03b1 P p0, 1q, it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary process defined by\n(119) \u03b7\u0302hptq \u201c \u03b7hptq \u00b4 e\u00b4t\u039bh,\nwhich is solution of the evolution equation\n(120) d\u03b7\u0302hptq dt \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03b7\u0302hptq ` DF pXptqq.\u03b7\u0302hptq ` DF pXptqq.e\u00b4t\u039bh,\nwith initial value \u03b7\u0302hp0q \u201c 0.

It remains to prove the second inequality (118). Let \u03d5 be of class C2 with bounded first and second order derivatives and T P p0,8q.

This concludes the proof of Lemma 5.12.\n6. Proofs of the main results\nThis section is organized as follows. The details of the proof of Theorem 4.4 (and of Proposition 4.6) are given in Subsection 6.1. This requires to consider the approximation of the invariant distribution \u00b58 \u201c \u00b5\u2039 and to let Assumption 4 to be satisfied, as a result the function \u03d5 is not required to be of class C2. Subsection 6.2 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 4.8, in a more general context, with functions \u03d5 assumed to be of class C2. Subsection 6.3 finally gives a sketch of the proof of Theorem 4.9.\n6.1. Proof of Theorem 4.4. This section is devoted to prove the major result of this article. The important feature is to prove a weak error estimate where the right-hand side depends on ~\u03d5~ (instead of ~\u03d5~2 in more standard approaches). For that purpose, it is first necessary to provide the proof of Proposition 4.6, which gives the required upper bound for the first order derivative Du\u03c4pt, xq.h of the solution u\u03c4 of the Kolmogorov equation (89).\nProof of Proposition 4.6. Let \u03b1 \u201c 1 2 \u00b4 \u03b4 P r0, 1 2 q, \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and let \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R be a bounded and continuous function. The proof of the inequality (52) requires to separate the cases t P p2\u03c4, 2q and t P r2,8q.\nOn the one hand, assume that t P p2\u03c4, 2q. Owing to the semigroup property (88), for all x, h P H one has\n|Du\u03c4 pt, xq.h| \u201c |DP\u03c4,t\u03d5pxq.h| \u201c |DP\u03c4, t 2\n`\nP\u03c4, t 2 \u03d5\n\u02d8\npxq.h|\n\u010f C\u03b1~P\u03c4, t 2 \u03d5~1\n\u00b4? \u03c4 |h| ` p t\n2 \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b4\u03b1|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1h|\n\u00af\n\u010f C\u03b1~\u03d5~0p t 2 \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b4 12\n\u00b4? \u03c4 |h| ` p t\n2 \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b4\u03b1|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1h|\n\u00af\nwhere the first inequality is a consequence of Lemma 5.5 and the second inequality is a consequence of Lemma 5.7. This yields the inequality (52) in the first case t P p2\u03c4, 2q.\nOn the other hand, assume that t P r2,8q.Owing to the semigroup property (88), for all x, h P H one has\n|Du\u03c4 pt, xq.h| \u201c |DP\u03c4,t\u03d5pxq.h| \u201c |DP\u03c4,1 ` P\u03c4,t\u00b41\u03d5 \u02d8 pxq.h|\n\u010f C\u03b1~P\u03c4,t\u00b41\u03d5~1 \u00b4? \u03c4 |h| ` p1 \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b4\u03b1|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1h| \u00af \u010f C\u03b1e\u00b4\u03bapt\u00b42q~P\u03c4,1\u03d5~1 \u00b4? \u03c4 |h| ` p1 \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b4\u03b1|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1h| \u00af\n\u010f C\u03b1e\u00b4\u03bat ` 1 ^ p1 \u00b4 \u03c4q \u02d8\u00b4 1 2 ~\u03d5~0 \u00b4? \u03c4 |h| ` p1 \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b4\u03b1|\u039b\u00b4\u03b1h| \u00af ,\nusing succesively Lemma 5.5, the equality P\u03c4,t\u00b41 \u201c P\u03c4,t\u00b42P\u03c4,1 (from the semigroup property (88)) and Lemma 5.6, and Lemma 5.7. Using the condition 1 \u00b4 \u03c4 \u011b 1 \u00b4 \u03c40 \u0105 0 for all t P p0, \u03c40q, one obtains (52) in the second case t P r2,8q.\nNote that the constant C\u03b1 does not depends on \u03c4 . This concludes the proof of Proposition 4.6.\nWe are now in position to provide the details of the proof of Theorem 4.4.\nProof of Theorem 4.4. The objective is to prove that the weak error estimate (49) for bounded and continuous functions \u03d5 P C0pH,Rq. Owing to the equality (15), this is sufficient to establish the error estimate (50) in the total variation distance, which is equivalent to (49).\nTo obtain the inequality (48), it suffices to let N \u00d1 8, for instance using the initial value x0 \u201c 0, since \u00b5\u03c48 is the unique invariant distribution of the modified Euler scheme, see Proposition 4.3.\nLet \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R be bounded and continuous, \u03c40 P p0, 1q and \u03b4 P p0, 12q. For any time-step size \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, any initial value x0 P H , and all N P N, the error is decomposed as\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 \u201c Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 ptNqqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 ` Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 ptN qqs,\nsee Equation (51), where u\u03c4 is defined by (87).

If X\u2039 is a H-valued random variable with distribution \u03c1X\u2039 \u201c \u00b5\u2039 and is independent of the Wiener process ` W ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0, then for all N P N, such that tN \u201c N\u03c4 \u011b 1, one has\n\u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 ptN qqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u201c \u02c7 \u02c7u\u03c4 ptN , x0q \u00b4 Eru\u03c4p0,X\u2039qs \u02c7 \u02c7\n\u201c \u02c7 \u02c7u\u03c4 ptN , x0q \u00b4 Eru\u03c4ptN ,X\u2039qs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f ~u\u03c4ptN , \u00a8q~1Er|x0 \u00b4 X\u2039|s \u010f Ce\u00b4\u03baptN \u00b41q~P\u03c4,1\u03d5~1p1 ` |x0|q \u010f Ce\u00b4\u03batN p1 \u00b4 \u03c4q\u00b4 12 ~\u03d5~0p1 ` |x0|q,\nusing the equality u\u03c4ptN , \u00a8q \u201c P\u03c4,tN\u03d5 \u201c P\u03c4,tN\u00b41 ` P\u03c4,1\u03d5 \u02d8\n(semigroup property (88)), Lemma 5.6 and the bound Er|X\u2039|s \u201c \u015f\n|x|d\u00b5\u2039pxq \u0103 8 (see Equation (26)) to obtain the first inequality, and Lemma 5.7 to obtain the second inequality.\nIt remains to deal with the other error term in the decomposition (51) of the error. Recall that the auxiliary process ` X\u0303\u03c4 ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is defined by (102) in Section 5.5.

Proof of Theorem 4.8. The objective of this section is to prove Theorem 4.8. More precisely, we prove that the weak error estimates (54) holds, for any function \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R of class C2 with bounded first and second order derivatives. This assumption is the main difference with respect to the proof of Theorem 4.4 presented above. As already explained in Section 4.3 and as will be clear below, the motivation for the more restrictive condition on \u03d5 is the treatment of an error term, which vanishes in the large time regime when the nonlinearity satisfies Assumption 4, and cannot be treated without assuming that \u03d5 is of class C2 by the approach considered in this work. Whether the regularity conditions on \u03d5 may be weakened in the framework of Theorem 4.8 is an open question.\nIn this section, without loss of generality it is assumed that the time-step size \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q satisfies the equality T \u201c N\u03c4 with N P N, where T P p0,8q is fixed. Recall that the solution X\u03c4N of the modified Euler scheme (29) is equal to X\u03c4,N defined by (37), see Section 3.3. As a consequence (see Equation (57)) the weak error can be decomposed as\n(124) Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u201c E\u03c4N,1 ` E\u03c42 pT q\nwith\n(125) E\u03c4N,1 \u201c Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pT qqs \u201c Eru\u03c4 p0,X\u03c4,Nqs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4pT,X\u03c4,0qs\nE\u03c42 pT q \u201c Er\u03d5pX\u03c4 pT qqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u201c Erup0,X\u03c4pT qqs \u00b4 ErupT,X\u03c4 p0qqs,\nwhere the functions u\u03c4 and u are defined by (87) and (109) respectively. To simplify the notation, it is assumed that the function \u03d5 satisfies the inequality ~\u03d5~1` ~\u03d5~2 \u010f 1, and the general case follows by a straightforward argument.\nProof of Theorem 4.8. Owing to the decomposition (124) of the weak error, the weak error estimate (54) is an immediate consequence of the two weak error estimates\n|E\u03c4N,1| \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 q,(126a)\n|E\u03c4N,2| \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|\u03b4q.(126b)\nLet us first establish the weak error estimate (126a). The arguments are similar to those used in the proof of Theorem 4.4 above, in particular it is not necessary to assume that \u03d5 is of class C2 to prove (126a). Since this condition is necessary below to prove (126b), the inequality (126a) is proved under this condition. Recall that the auxiliary process ` X\u0303\u03c4 ptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 is defined by (102) in Section 5.5.

Proof of Theorem 4.9. The details of the proof of Theorem 4.9 are standard and are omitted. The main changes compared with the proof of Theorem 4.8 written above is the need to exploit the results of Lemma 5.6 and Lemma 5.11 to obtain factors of the type expp\u00b4\u03batq in the upper bounds for Du\u03c4 pt, xq.h, Dupt, xq.h and D2upt, xq.ph1, h2q. As a consequence, the constants C\u03b4pT q appearing in the proof of Theorem 4.8 above are replaced by constants C\u03b4 which are independent of the final time. This approach is standard and is already used in the proof of Theorem 4.4 above. We also refer to [12] for a similar analysis to prove error estimates for the approximation of the invariant distribution \u00b58 using the standard Euler scheme. The details of the proof are thus left to the interested reader.\n7. Results on the accelerated exponential Euler scheme\nThe section is organized as follows. Instrumental auxiliary results are stated and proved in Subsection 7.1 and the details of the proof of Theorem 4.12 are given in Subsection 7.2. The arguments are similar to those used in Section 6.1 to prove Theorem 4.4, but the analysis of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme does not require Assumption 4 to be satisfied or to consider only the approximation of the invariant distribution. Finally, in Subsection 7.3 the strong rate of convergence of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme is studied: we check that in this case the strong order is 1{2 and coincides with the weak order of convergence exhibited in Theorem 4.12.\nRecall that the accelerated exponential Euler scheme\n(128) X\u03c4,en`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039bX\u03c4,en ` \u039b\u00b41pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039bqF pX\u03c4,en q ` \u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039bdW psq, X\u03c4,e0 \u201c x0,\nsee Equation (44) in Section 4.\n7.1.

Gathering the estimates gives the inequality (134). This concludes the proof of Lemma 7.2.\n7.2. Proof of Theorem 4.12. Using the auxiliary results presented in Subsection 7.1 above, we are now in position to prove Theorem 4.12.\nProof of Theorem 4.12. Like in the proof of Theorem 4.4, it suffices to establish the weak error estimate (68) when the function \u03d5 is bounded and continuous. The weak error is written and decomposed as follows:\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4,eN qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u201c Erup0, X\u03c4,eN qs \u00b4 ErupT,X\u03c4,e0 qs \u201c Erup0, X\u0303\u03c4,eptNqqs \u00b4 ErupT, X\u0303\u03c4,ep0qqs\n\u201c N\u00b41 \u00ff\nn\u201c0\n\u00b4 EruptN \u00b4 tn`1, X\u0303\u03c4,eptn`1qqs \u00b4 EruptN \u00b4 tn, X\u0303\u03c4,eptnqqs \u00af\n\u201c N\u00b41 \u00ff\nn\u201c0 e\u03c4,en ,\nwith e\u03c4,en \u201c EruptN \u00b4 tn`1, X\u0303\u03c4,eptn`1qqs \u00b4 EruptN \u00b4 tn, X\u0303\u03c4,eptnqqs for all n P t0, . . . , N \u00b4 1u, using a standard telescoping sum argument, where u is defined by (109). Applying It\u00f4\u2019s formula, using the expression (132) for the evolution of the auxiliary process and the fact that u solves the Kolmogorov equation (111), one obtains, for all n P N0, the expression\ne\u03c4,en \u201c \u017c tn`1\ntn\nE \u201c DuptN \u00b4 t, X\u0303\u03c4,eptqq. ` F pX\u0303\u03c4,eptnqq \u00b4 F pX\u0303\u03c4,eptqq \u02d8\u2030 dt.\nUsing the regularity estimate (129) from Proposition 7.1, then Assumption 5 and the Cauchy\u2013 Schwarz inequality, one obtains for all n P N0\n|e\u03c4,en | \u010f C\u03b4pT q~\u03d5~0 \u017c tn`1\ntn\n1\nptN \u00b4 tq1\u00b4 \u03b4 8\nEr \u02c7 \u02c7\u039b\u00b4 1 2 ` \u03b4 2 ` F pX\u0303\u03c4,eptnqq \u00b4 F pX\u0303\u03c4,eptqq \u02d8\u02c7 \u02c7sdt\n\u010f C\u03b4pT q~\u03d5~0 \u017c tn`1\ntn\n1\nptN \u00b4 tq1\u00b4 \u03b4 8\n` Er ` 1 ` |X\u0303\u03c4,eptq|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 ` |X\u0303\u03c4,eptnq|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 \u02d8 s \u02d8\n1 2\n` Er \u02c7 \u02c7\u039b\u00b4 1 4 ` \u03b4 2 pX\u0303\u03c4,eptnq \u00b4 X\u0303\u03c4,eptqq \u02c7 \u02c7s \u02d8 1 2dt.\nFinally, using the inequalities (133) and (136), one obtains\n\u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4,eN qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u02c7\n\u02c7 \u010f N\u00b41 \u00ff\nn\u201c0 |e\u03c4,en | \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4\n1 2 \u00b4\u03b4~\u03d5~0 \u017c 8\n0\n1\nt1\u00b4 \u03b4 8\ndtp1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 q.\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 4.12.\n7.3. Strong convergence of the exponential Euler scheme. Theorem 4.12 states that the weak order of convergence of the (accelerated) exponential Euler scheme (128) is equal to 1{2. If the function \u03d5 is assumed to be of class C1 with bounded derivative, instead of being bounded and measurable, a proof of the weak error estimate is obtained using Lemma 5.10 directly instead of Proposition 7.1 above. Note that contrary to the analysis of the standard Euler scheme or of the modifed Euler scheme (see Theorem 4.8), it is not needed to assume that \u03d5 is of class C2 with bounded first and second order derivatives. This difference is due to the construction of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme, which is exact when F \u201c 0, in other words the stochastic convolution is computed with no error.\nIn fact, when the conditions of Theorem 4.12 are satisfied, the accelerated exponential Euler scheme (128) has strong order of convergence equal to 1{2.\nProposition 7.3. Let the nonlinearity F satisfy Assumptions 2 and 5. For all T P p0,8q, \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 q and \u03c40 P p0, 1q, there exists C\u03b4pT q P p0,8q such that for all \u03c4 \u201c TN P p0, \u03c40q\nwith N P N, and all x0 P H 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 one has\n(137) sup nPN;n\u03c4\u010fT\nEr|Xpn\u03c4q \u00b4 X\u03c4,en |s \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4`1 ` |x0| 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 \u02d8 .\nThe strong convergence estimate (137) is a variant of the results of [44], under slightly different assumptions on the linearity F . A proof is given below for completeness. It is thus not surprising that it is sufficient to assume that \u03d5 is Lipschitz continuous to obtain weak error estimates with order 1{2 for this integrator, instead of assuming \u03d5 is of class C2 in standard results. Theorem 4.12 is a substantial improvement of this straightforward result, since \u03d5 is only assumed to be bounded and measurable, in particular it is not Lipschitz continuous.\nProof of Proposition 7.3. The strong error estimate (137) is a straightforward consequence of the more precise result\nsup 0\u010ft\u010ft\nEr|XpT q \u00b4 X\u0303\u03c4,eptq|s \u010f C\u03b4pT q\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4`1 ` |x0| 1 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 \u02d8 ,\nwhere ` X\u0303\u03c4,eptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 is the auxiliary process defined by (131).

The details are omitted.\n8.2. Kolmogorov equation associated with the modified equations. The objective of this section is to state and prove regularity results for the functions u\u03c4,st and u\u03c4,st\u2039 defined by\n(150) u\u03c4,stpt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pX \u03c4,stptqqs,\nand\n(151) u\u03c4,st\u2039 pt, xq \u201c Exr\u03d5pX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptqqs,\nfor all t \u011b 0, x P H , and \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, where \u03d5 is a bounded and measurable function from H to R. In the above definitions, ` X \u03c4,stptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 and ` X \u03c4,st\u2039 ptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 are the unique solutions of\nthe modified stochastic evolution equation (138), with initial values X \u03c4,stp0q \u201c X \u03c4,st\u2039 p0q \u201c x. Like in Section 5.4, in order to study the regularity properties of the functions u\u03c4,st and u\u03c4,st\u2039 , it is convenient to rely on the convention introduced in Section 2.7. An auxiliary finite dimensional approximation is applied, in order to justify the regularity properties and the computations, and all the upper bounds do not depend on the auxiliary discretization parameter, which is omitted to simplify the notation.\nIt is convenient to introduce the families of linear operators ` P \u03c4,st t \u02d8 t\u011b0 and ` P \u03c4,st \u2039,t \u02d8 t\u011b0, such that u\u03c4,spt, \u00a8q \u201c P\u03c4,stt \u03d5p\u00a8q and u\u03c4,s\u2039 pt, \u00a8q \u201c P\u03c4,st\u2039,t \u03d5p\u00a8q for all t \u011b 0. The Markov property for the solutions of the modified stochastic evolution equations (138) yields the semigroup property: for all t, s \u011b 0 and all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, one has\n(152) P\u03c4,stt`s\u03d5 \u201c P\u03c4,stt ` P\u03c4,sts \u03d5 \u02d8 , P \u03c4,st \u2039,t`s\u03d5 \u201c P\u03c4,st\u2039,t ` P\u03c4,st\u2039,s \u03d5 \u02d8\nfor any \u03d5 P BbpHq.

However, the proof of Lemma 8.4 is more technical than the proof of Proposition 4.6, therefore detailed proofs are given.\nLemma 8.4. Let Assumptions 3 and 6 be satisfied and \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R be a bounded and continuous function. For all t \u0105 0 and \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, u\u03c4,stpt, \u00a8q and u\u03c4,st\u2039 are differentiable and one has the following estimates: for all \u03b4 P p0, 1\n2 s, there exists C\u03b4 P p0,8q such that for all\n\u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q and for all t P p2\u03c4,8q, one has\n(155)\n\u02c7 \u02c7Du\u03c4,stpt, xq.h \u02c7 \u02c7 ` \u02c7 \u02c7Du\u03c4,st\u2039 pt, xq.h \u02c7 \u02c7\n\u010f C\u03b4e\u00b4\u03bat~\u03d5~0 ` 1 ^ pt \u00b4 2\u03c4q \u02d8\u00b4 1 2 \u00b4? \u03c4 |h| ` ` 1 ^ pt \u00b4 2\u03c4q \u02d8\u00b4 1 2 `\u03b4|\u039b\u00b4 12 `\u03b4h| \u00af\nfor all x, h P H, with \u03ba \u201c logp1`\u03c40\u03bb1q \u03c4\u03bb1 p\u03bb1 \u00b4 LF q \u0105 0.\nProof of Lemma 8.4. Like the proof of Proposition 4.6, the inequality (155) for u\u03c4,st and u\u03c4,st\u2039 is obtained by the combination of three estimates using the semigroup property (152).

To prove the inequalities (156) and (157), the following expression for the first order derivative Du\u03c4,stpt, xq.h is used, when \u03d5 is of class C1 with bounded derivative: one has\nDu\u03c4,stpt, xq.h \u201c ExrD\u03d5pX \u03c4,stptqq.\u03beh\u03c4 ptqs,\nwhere ` \u03beh\u03c4 ptq \u02d8 t\u011b0 is solution of\nd\u03beh\u03c4 ptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4\u03beh\u03c4 ptqdt ` Q\u03c4DF pX \u03c4,stptqq.\u03beh\u03c4 ptq,\nwith initial value \u03beh\u03c4 p0q \u201c h.

The proofs of the inequalities (156) and (157) are identical to the proofs of (94) from Lemma 5.5 and (97) from Lemma 5.6 respectively. Using the inequality (139), the proofs of the inequalities (159) and (160) follow from the same arguments. The details are omitted.\nIt remains to prove the inequalities (158) and (161). The proofs are not straightforward modifications of the proof of (98) from Lemma 5.7, therefore it is worth giving the details. The reason for the additional difficulties is the behavior of the unbounded linear operator R \u00b4 1 2 \u03c4 \u201c Q\u00b4 1 2 \u03c4 pI ` \u03c4\u039b2 q 1 2 which differs from the behavior of the operator Q \u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 appearing in the proof of Lemma 5.7.\nTo prove the inequalities (158) and (161), the following expressions for the first order derivatives Du\u03c4,stpt, xq.h and Du\u03c4,st\u2039 pt, xq.h are used, when \u03d5 is assumed to be only bounded and continuous: for all t P p0,8q and x, h P H , one has\nDu\u03c4,stpt, xq.h \u201c 1 t Exr\u03d5pX \u03c4,stptqq\n\u017c t\n0\nxR\u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 \u03be h \u03c4 psq, dW psqys,\nDu\u03c4,st\u2039 pt, xq.h \u201c 1\nt Exr\u03d5pX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptqq\n\u017c t\n0\nxR\u00b4 1 2\n\u03c4 \u03be h \u03c4,\u2039psq, dW psqys.\nThe proof of the inequality (161) employs simpler arguments than the proof of the inequality (158). Like the proof of Lemma 5.7, two steps are required.

It remains to prove the inequality (158). Like in the proof of the inequality (161) given above, two steps are required but different arguments need to be used since R\u03c4 \u2030 Q\u03c4 .

Like in the proof of Proposition 4.6 (see Section 6.1), the inequalities in (155) are obtained by combining the three estimates (156), (157) and (158), and the three estimates (159), (160) and (161), using the semigroup property (152). The details are omitted.\nThe proof of Lemma 8.4 is thus completed.\n8.3. Proof of Theorem 4.11. We are now in position to provide the proof of Theorem 4.11, using the auxiliary results presented in Subsections 8.1 and 8.2 above.\nProof of Theorem 4.11. Like for the proof of Theorem 4.4 (see Section 6.1), it suffices to establish the weak error estimate (62) for all functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R which are bounded and continuous. Indeed, this property then yields\ndTVp\u03c1X\u03c4,st N , \u00b58\u2039 q \u201c d0p\u03c1X\u03c4,st N , \u00b58\u2039 q \u010f C\u03b4 \u00b4 \u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 2 q ` e\u00b4\u03baN\u03c4 p1 ` |x0|q \u00af .\nAs a consequence, the inequality (62) also holds for functions \u03d5 which are bounded and measurable. Moreover, it suffices to let N \u00d1 8 to obtain the inequality (61).\nLet \u03d5 be bounded and continuous, then the weak error can be decomposed as\nEr\u03d5pX\u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039 \u201c Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,stptNqs\n` Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,stptN qqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptNqs ` Er\u03d5pX \u03c4,st\u2039 ptN qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039\n\u201c Eru\u03c4,stp0,X \u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4,stptN ,X \u03c4,st0 qs ` Eru\u03c4,st\u2039 p0,X \u03c4,stptNqqs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4,s\u2039 ptN ,X \u03c4,stp0qqs ` Eru\u03c4,s\u2039 ptN , x0qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039,\nsee Equation (66), where the functions u\u03c4,st and u\u03c4,st\u2039 are defined by (150) and (151) respectively. It thus suffices to prove the three following weak error estimates:\n\u02c7 \u02c7Eru\u03c4,stp0,X \u03c4,stN qs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4,stptN ,X \u03c4,st0 qs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4~\u03d5~0p1 ` |x0|21 4 \u00b4 \u03b4 8 q,(164) \u02c7\n\u02c7Eru\u03c4,st\u2039 p0,X \u03c4,stptN qqs \u00b4 Eru\u03c4,s\u2039 ptN ,X \u03c4,stp0qqs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4~\u03d5~0\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u03b4p1 ` |x0|2\u03b4q,(165) \u02c7\n\u02c7Eru\u03c4,s\u2039 ptN , x0qs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u03c4\u2039 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f Ce\u00b4\u03batN ~\u03d5~0p1 ` |x0|q.(166)\nAbove and in the sequel, \u03b4 P p0, 1 2 q is an arbitrarily small positive real number and C\u03b4 P p0,8q is independent of \u03c4 , N and x0. The proofs of the inequalities (164) and (166) employs the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 4.4, however one needs additional arguments to prove the inequality (165). \u201a Proof of the inequality (164). Recall that the auxiliary process ` X\u0303 \u03c4,stptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is defined by Equation (146), and satisfies\nX\u0303 \u03c4,stptnq \u201c X \u03c4,stn for all n P N0.

Recall that \u00b5\u03c4\u2039 is defined by Equation (59) in Section 4.4, and is the invariant distribution of the modified stochastic evolution equation (65), when the nonlinearity F satisfies Assumption 4, i. e. F \u201c \u00b4DV . Let X \u03c4\u2039 be a H-valued random variable with distribution \u03c1X \u03c4\u2039 \u201c \u00b5\u03c4\u2039 and assume that it is independent of the Wiener process ` W ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0.

This concludes the proof of the inequality (166). \u201a Combining the three inequalities (164), (165) and (166), one obtains the weak error estimate (62) for all functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R which are bounded and continuous. Owing to the arguments given above, the proof of Theorem 4.11 is thus completed.\n9. Applications and extensions of the modified Euler scheme\nThis section is devoted to the presentation of two applications of the proposed modified Euler scheme (4), which aim to illustrate again the superiority of that integrator compared with the standard Euler scheme (3). In Subsection 9.1, an asymptotic preserving scheme is provided to approximate the slow component of a multiscale stochastic evolution system, where the application of the modified Euler scheme is able to capture the so-called averaged coefficient which governs the behavior of the limiting evolution equation (averaging principle). In Subsection 9.2, the modified Euler scheme is employed as a proposal transition kernel for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to approximate the Gibbs distribution (25), which is shown to be well defined and to have a spectral gap in infinite dimension. Using the accelerated exponential Euler scheme would give similar results, however the standard Euler scheme fails in both situations. Finally, the range of application of the modified Euler scheme is extended in Subsection 9.3, to encompass stochastic evolution equations with non-globally Lipschitz drift, with multiplicative noise or with colored noise, possibly in higher dimension. The validity of the main results in those situations is discussed, however precise statements and proofs are omitted.\nNote that the two applications presented in subsections 9.1 and 9.2 are direct consequences of the preservation of the Gaussian invariant distribution \u03bd in the Ornstein\u2013 Uhlenbeck case (F \u201c 0) when using the modified Euler scheme, see Proposition 3.1.\n9.1. Asymptotic preserving scheme. We refer to [9] for a more detailed analysis of the problem discussed in this section.\nThe modified Euler scheme can be applied to design an efficient integrator for the slowfast SPDE system\n(167)\n$\n&\n%\ndX\u01ebptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bX\u01ebptqdt ` G ` X \u01ebptq,Y\u01ebptq \u02d8 dt\ndY\u01ebptq \u201c \u00b41 \u01eb \u039bY\u01ebptqdt ` \u03c3pX \u01ebptqq? \u01eb dW ptq,\nwhere \u01eb P p0, \u01eb0q is a small parameter, and where G : H \u02c6 H \u00d1 H and \u03c3 : H \u00d1 R are bounded and globally Lipschitz continuous mappings. The linear operator \u039b and the cylindrical Wiener process ` W ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 satisfy the conditions presented in Section 2. Moreover,\nthe initial values x0 \u201c X\u01ebp0q and y0 \u201c Y\u01ebp0q are assumed to be deterministic, and independent of the parameter \u01eb.\nIf the mapping \u03c3 is constant, the fast component Y\u01eb is a H-valued Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process, which does not depend on the slow component X\u01eb. In that case one has the equality in distribution\n`\nY \u01ebptq\n\u02d8 t\u011b0 \u201c ` Yp t \u01eb q \u02d8 t\u011b0\nfor all \u01eb P p0, \u01eb0q, where Y is the solution of the stochastic evolution equation\ndYptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bYptqdt ` dW ptq.\nThe H-valued Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process Y is ergodic, and its unique invariant distribution is the Gaussian distribution \u03bd (see (24) from Section 2.6). When \u03c3 is not constant, one needs to consider the invariant distribution \u03bdx \u201c N p0, \u03c3pxq 2 2 \u039b\u00b41q of the stochastic evolution equation\ndYxptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bYxptqdt ` \u03c3pxqdW ptq\nwith frozen slow component x P H . In this section, we study the behavior of the system (167) and of numerical schemes in the regime \u01eb \u00d1 0. On the one hand, to approximate ` X \u01ebpT q,Y\u01ebpT q \u02d8 , in the strong or weak sense, applying an integrator with time-step size \u03c4 \u201c T N\n, the presence of the small parameter \u01eb in the fast evolution equation requires to choose \u03c4 \u201c op\u01ebq. On the other hand, the slow component X\u01eb satisfies the averaging principle: X\u01eb converges to X when \u01eb \u00d1 0, where X is solution of the averaged equation\n(168) dXptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bXptqdt ` GpXptqq,\nwith initial value Xp0q \u201c x0, where for all x P H\n(169) Gpxq \u201c \u017c\nGpx, yqd\u03bdxpyq \u201c EY\u201e\u03bdxrGpx,Yxqs \u201c EY\u201e\u03bdrGpx, \u03c3pxqYqs.\nThe convergence above holds in both the strong and weak senses for the system considered in this section. See for instance [25] for convergence results and [10] for strong and weak rates of convergence. As a result of the averaging principle, if the objective is to approximate only the slow component X\u01eb, the time-step size restriction \u03c4 \u201c op\u01ebq may not be necessary.\nThe observations above lead to the following question: is it possible to design numerical schemes which are efficient in both regimes \u01eb P p0, \u01eb0q and \u01eb \u00d1 0, and which do not impose time-step size restrictions? An answer is provided by asymptotic preserving schemes. Rougly, a numerical scheme `\nX \u01eb,\u03c4 n ,Y \u01eb,\u03c4 n qn\u011b0 is asymptotic preserving scheme when the follow-\ning conditions are satisfied.\n\u201a For any \u01eb P p0, \u01eb0q, the scheme is consistent with the system (167), namely one has X\n\u01eb,\u03c4 N \u00d1\n\u03c4\u00d10 X \u01ebpT q and Y\u01eb,\u03c4N \u00d1 \u03c4\u00d10 Y \u01ebpT q (with the condition T \u201c N\u03c4).\n\u201a For any \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, there exists a limiting scheme, namely X\u01eb,\u03c4n \u00d1 \u01eb\u00d10 X 0,\u03c4 n , where the\nsequence `\nX 0,\u03c4 n\n\u02d8\nn\u011b0 is a Markov chain.\n\u201a The limiting scheme is consistent with the averaged equation (168), meaning that one has X0,\u03c4N \u00d1\n\u03c4\u00d10 XpT q (with the condition T \u201c N\u03c4).\nThe convergence results above may hold either in weak and strong senses.

For a more complete overview of asymptotic preserving schemes for deterministic and stochastic systems, we refer to [9].\nThe main result of this section is to check that the following numerical scheme is asymptotic preserving, where the fast Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck component is discretized using the modified Euler scheme.\nTheorem 9.1.

Let us introduce the auxiliary scheme ` X \u03c4\nn\n\u02d8\nn\u011b0, obtained by the application of the stan-\ndard Euler scheme to the averaged equation (168): for all n \u011b 0, set X \u03c4\nn`1 \u201c A\u03c4 ` X \u03c4 n ` \u03c4GpX \u03c4 nq \u02d8 ,\nwith initial value X \u03c4 0 \u201c x0. Let \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R be a mapping of class C2, with bounded first and second order derivatives.

The crucial property for the proof of the consistency of the limiting scheme (171) with the averaged equation (168), hence of the asymptotic preserving property, is the following inequality: for all n P t0, . . . , N \u00b4 1u, one has\nErDuN\u00b4n\u00b41pA\u03c4X0,\u03c4n q. ` GpX0,\u03c4n , \u03c3pX0,\u03c4n qQ 1 2\u0393nq \u00b4 GpX0,\u03c4n q \u02d8 s \u201c 0, using a conditional expectation argument and the definition (169) of the averaged nonlinearity G: indeed X0,\u03c4n and \u0393n are independent and Q 1 2\u0393n \u201e \u03bd.\nUsing a Taylor expansion argument, one then obtains\n\u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX0,\u03c4N qs \u00b4 \u03d5pXX \u03c4 Nq \u02c7\n\u02c7 \u010f \u03c4 2 N\u00b41 \u00ff\nn\u201c0 ~u\u03c4N\u00b4n\u00b41~2Er|GpX0,\u03c4n , \u03c3pX0,\u03c4n qQ 1 2\u0393nq|2 ` |GpXnq|2s\n\u010f CpT q\u03c4p~\u03d5~1 ` ~\u03d5~2q, since G is assumed to be bounded.\nGathering the estimates then concludes the proof of the weak error estimate (173) and of item piiq.\nThe proof of Theorem 9.1 is thus completed.\nThe asymptotic preserving property stated in Theorem 9.1 can be written as follows: for any bounded and continuous mapping \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R, one has (175) lim\n\u03c4\u00d10 lim \u01eb\u00d10 Er\u03d5pX\u01eb,\u03c4N qs \u201c lim \u01eb\u00d10 lim \u03c4\u00d10 Er\u03d5pX\u01eb,\u03c4N qs,\nwith fixed T \u201c N\u03c4 . Owing to this property, there is no restriction on the time-step size \u03c4 in terms of \u01eb, and the scheme (170) provides an accurate approximation of X\u01ebpT q for any fixed \u01eb and of XpT q when \u01eb \u00d1 0. However, the asymptotic preserving property above does not provide relevant information for choosing the time-step size \u03c4 in order to achieve a\ngiven tolerance error when applying the scheme, either for a fixed \u01eb or in the regime \u01eb \u00d1 0. To study the computational cost of the scheme (170) in terms of \u01eb, the relevant question to consider is whether the scheme is uniformly accurate, i.e. whether uniform weak error estimates\n(176) sup \u01ebPp0,\u01eb0s\n\u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u01eb,\u03c4N qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX\u01ebpT qqs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u00d1 \u03c4\u00d10 0,\nwhen T \u201c N\u03c4 is fixed, for a suitable class of functions \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R. When (176) holds, the time-step size \u03c4 may be chosen independently of \u01eb in order to achieve a given accuracy of the approximation. We refer to [9] for the proof of the uniform accuracy property (176), when \u03c3 is constant. More precisely, under appropriate conditions, one obtains in [9] uniform weak error estimates of the type\nsup \u01ebPp0,\u01eb0s\n\u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u01eb,\u03c4N qs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pX\u01ebpT qqs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u03b4pT, x0, \u03d5q\u03c4 1 3 \u00b4\u03b4\nfor functions \u03d5 of class C3. The proof of (176) requires many additional technical arguments. To conclude this subsection, let us compare the performances of the modified Euler scheme and of other schemes when applied to discretize the fast Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck component Y\u01eb in the SPDE system (167). On the one hand, employing the accelerated exponential Euler method would result also in an asymptotic preserving scheme: a variant of Theorem 9.1 also holds for the scheme\n(177)\n$\n\u2019 &\n\u2019 %\nX \u01eb,\u03c4,e n`1 \u201c A\u03c4\n`\nX \u01eb,\u03c4,e n ` \u03c4GpX\u01eb,\u03c4,en ,Y\u01eb,\u03c4,en`1q\n\u02d8\nY \u01eb,\u03c4,e n`1 \u201c e\u00b4 \u03c4 \u01eb \u039b Y \u01eb,\u03c4,e n ` \u03c3pX\u01eb,\u03c4,en q? \u01eb \u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4 tn`1\u00b4t \u01eb \u039bdW ptq.\nThis result is not surprising since the accelerated exponential Euler scheme preserves the distribution of the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck component. The details of the proof of the asymptotic preserving property for the scheme (177) are omitted.\nOn the other hand, if the fast component Y\u01eb is discretized using the standard Euler method, the scheme\n(178)\n$\n\u2019 &\n\u2019 %\nX \u01eb,\u03c4,st n`1 \u201c A\u03c4\n`\nX \u01eb,\u03c4,st n ` \u03c4GpX\u01eb,\u03c4,stn ,Y\u01eb,\u03c4,stn`1 q\n\u02d8\nY \u01eb,\u03c4,st n`1 \u201c A \u03c4\u01eb\n\u00b4\nY \u01eb,\u03c4,st n ` \u03c3pX\u01eb,\u03c4,stn q\nc\n\u03c4 \u01eb \u0393n\n\u00af\nis not asymptotic preserving in general.

The construction of the asymptotic preserving scheme (170) for the SPDE system (167) is another illustration of the superiority of the modified Euler scheme compared with the standard method.\nRemark 9.2.

As a consequence, the costs of each iteration of the schemes (170) and (179) are of the same order.

            "text": "9.2.1. Context. The objective of this subsection is to describe how the modified Euler scheme proposed in this article can be used as a proposal kernel in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Recall that the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039 is defined by (25) (see Proposition 2.3. It is assumed that the mapping V : H \u00d1 R is bounded and of class C3 with bounded derivatives. In order to approximate integrals \u015f\n\u03d5d\u00b5\u2039, the MCMC method consists in introducing an H-valued Markov chain `\nXn\n\u02d8\nn\u011b0 which is ergodic and admits \u00b5\u2039 as its\nunique invariant distribution: an estimator of \u015f\n\u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 is then defined as the temporal average\n1\nN\nN \u00ff n\u201c1 \u03d5pXnq,\nwhich converges when N \u00d1 8 almost surely to \u015f\n\u03d5d\u00b5\u2039. To analyze the quality of the approximation, it may be convenient to study the spectral gap of the considered Markov chain, when it is reversible with respect to \u00b5\u2039.\nA popular strategy to design such Markov chains is the Metropolis\u2013Hastings method, which requires two ingredients:\n\u201a the choice of a proposal kernel, \u201a an acceptance-rejection rule,\nwhich are needed to ensure that \u00b5\u2039 is an invariant distribution. The resulting Markov chain is then reversible with respect to \u00b5\u2039, by construction. In an infinite dimensional context, the choice of the proposal kernel is crucial in order to obtain well-defined acceptance-rejection\nratios. As explained in [29], using the preconditioned Crank\u2013Nicolson (pCN) proposal kernel\nX\u0302 \u03c4,pCN n`1 \u201c X\u03c4,pCNn \u00b4\n\u03c4 2 pX\u03c4,pCNn ` X\u03c4,pCNn`1 q ` \u039b\u00b4 1 2\n? \u03c4\u0393n,\nleads to a well-defined Metropolis\u2013Hastings MCMC method, for any value of the time-step size \u03c4 . On the contrary, for all \u03b8 P r0, 1szt1\n2 u, using the proposal kernel\nX\u0302 \u03c4,\u03b8 n`1 \u201c X\u03c4,\u03b8n \u00b4\n` p1 \u00b4 \u03b8q\u03c4X\u03c4,\u03b8n ` \u03b8\u03c4X\u03c4,\u03b8n`1 \u02d8 ` \u039b\u00b4 12 ? \u03c4\u0393n,\nbased on the \u03b8-method, the acceptance-rejection ratio is ill-defined in infinite dimension. For the pCN proposal kernel, the associated acceptance ratio is computed as\napCNpx, x\u0302q \u201c minp1, e2pV pxq\u00b4V px\u0302qqq,\nwhich means that the Markov chain is constructed as follows: for all n \u011b 0,\nX \u03c4,pCN n`1 \u201c 1Un\u010fapCNpX\u03c4,pCNn ,X\u0302\u03c4,pCNn`1 qX\u0302 \u03c4,pCN n`1 ` 1Un\u0105apCNpX\u03c4,pCNn ,X\u0302\u03c4,pCNn`1 qX \u03c4,pCN n ,\nwhere ` \u0393n \u02d8\nn\u011b0 is a sequence of independent cylindrical H-valued Gaussian random variables,\nand ` Un \u02d8\nn\u011b0 is a sequence of independent random variables which are uniformly distributed\non r0, 1s, and the two sequences are independent. The choice of the auxiliary parameter \u03c4 has an impact on the performance on the method, which is not discussed in this work.\nThe proposal kernel in the pCN Markov chain `\nX \u03c4,pCN n\n\u02d8\nn\u011b0 consists in applying the Crank\u2013Nicolson method to discretize the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck dynamics\ndZpptq \u201c \u00b4Zpptqdt ` \u039b\u00b4 12dW ptq\nwhich can be interpreted as a preconditioned version of the stochastic evolution equation\ndZptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bZptqdt ` dW ptq.\nNote that the crucial property is the fact that \u03bd is the invariant distribution of the Ornstein\u2013 Uhlenbeck process ` Zpptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0, and that the Crank\u2013Nicolson scheme preserves this invariant\ndistribution, for any choice of \u03c4 . See [16] for the analysis of integrators applied to preconditioned stochastic evolution equations for the approximation of the Gibbs invariant distribution \u00b5\u2039.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the construction of MCMC methods using a numerical discretization of the process ` Zptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 (instead of its preconditioned version ` Zpptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0), has not been treated in the literature so far.

MCMC method based on the modified Euler scheme. Let us state the main result of this subsection: a Metropolis\u2013Hastings MCMC method is well-defined in infinite dimension when using the modified Euler scheme as the proposal kernel.\nTheorem 9.3. For all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, introduce the Markov chain defined by\n(180)\n#\nX\u0302 \u03c4 n`1 \u201c A\u03c4X\u03c4n ` ? \u03c4B\u03c4,1\u0393n,1 ` ? \u03c4B\u03c4,2\u0393n,2\nX \u03c4 n`1 \u201c 1Un\u010fapX\u03c4n,X\u0302\u03c4n`1qX\u0302 \u03c4 n`1 ` 1Un\u0105apX\u03c4n,X\u0302\u03c4n`1qX \u03c4 n,\nwhere the acceptance-rejection ratio is defined by\n(181) apx, x\u0302q \u201c minp1, e2pV pxq\u00b4V px\u0302qqq for all x, x\u0302 P H, and where ` \u0393n,1 \u02d8 n\u011b0 and ` \u0393n,2 \u02d8 n\u011b0 are two independent sequences of independent cylindrical H-valued Gaussian random variables, and ` Un \u02d8\nn\u011b0 is a sequence of\nindependent random variables which are uniformly distributed on r0, 1s, which is independent of the two sequences ` \u0393n,1 \u02d8 n\u011b0 and ` \u0393n,2 \u02d8 n\u011b0. Let P \u03c4 denote the transition operator associated with the Markov chain: for all x P H and n P N, and any bounded and measurable function \u03d5 : H \u00d1 R,\npP\u03c4qn\u03d5pxq \u201c Exr\u03d5pXnqs. Assume that V is bounded and globally Lipschitz continuous. The H-valued Markov chain `\nX \u03c4 n\n\u02d8\nn\u011b0 is ergodic, and its invariant distribution is the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039. In addition, this Markov chain admits a spectral gap in the following sense: for all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, there exists \u03bap\u03c4q P p0, 1q, such that for all \u03d5 P L2p\u00b5\u2039q, one has (182) }pP\u03c4qn\u03d5 \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039}L2p\u00b5\u2039 \u010f e\u00b4\u03bap\u03c4qn\u03c4 }\u03d5 \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039}L2p\u00b5\u2039q,\nwith }\u03d5}2 L2p\u00b5\u2039q \u201c\n\u015f\n\u03d5pxq2d\u00b5\u2039pxq.\nObserve that the acceptance-ratio apX\u03c4n, X\u0302\u03c4n`1q appearing in (180) is defined with the same expression as for the pCN Markov chain mentioned above. Before proceeding with the proof of Theorem 9.3, it is worth mentioning that the spectral gap inequality (182) from Theorem 9.3 and the error estimate (49) from Theorem 4.4 have different formulations. The comparisons of the performances of these two methods to approximate \u015f\n\u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 is out of the scope of this article. However, it is possible to compare the results as follows. On the one hand, using the MCMC method (180) instead of the modified Euler scheme (29), results in the absence of bias due to the choice of the time-step size \u03c4 \u0105 0. In addition, the assumptions on the function V are weaker to obtain Theorem 9.3: it is only assumed that V is bounded and globally Lipschitz continuous, whereas it is required that F \u201c \u00b4DV satisfies Assumption 3 to obtain Theorem 4.4, meaning that ~V ~2 \u0103 \u03bb1 needs to be small enough. On the other hand, there are two disadvantages with the spectral gap inequality (182) compared with the weak error estimate (49). First, the value of \u03bap\u03c4q obtained in the proof of Theorem 9.3 is not explicit and may depend on \u03c4 , in particular it may be the case that \u03bap\u03c4q \u00d1 0 when \u03c4 \u0105 0. On the contrary, the rate \u03ba of convergence to equilibrium in (49) is independent of \u03c4 . Second, the weak error estimate (49) allows one to approximate \u015f\n\u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 starting the modified Euler scheme from an arbitrary initial condition x P H . On the contrary, the spectral gap inequality is a L2 estimate instead of a pointwise bound with respect to x. Finally, note that the spectral gap inequality (182) is a consequence of estimates in a Wasserstein\ndistance-like function, whereas the weak error estimate (49) is related to estimates in total variation distance. The construction of the MCMC method in Theorem 9.3 is a new result, which provides an alternative to the widely used pCN sampler. It is not clear whether the performances of the MCMC method are better, compared either with using directly the modified Euler scheme, or with using the pCN method. This question may be investigated theoretically and numerically in future works.\nThe performance of the MCMC method depending on the value of the auxiliary timestep size parameter \u03c4 is not studied in this work. In addition to the analysis of the behavior of the spectral gap \u03bap\u03c4q, it may be appropriate to study whether diffusion limits hold, like in [49], in order to identify the optimal averaged acceptance probabilities to guide the choice of \u03c4 in practice. These questions are left open for future work.\nProving Theorem 9.3 requires two main contributions. First, one needs to check that the Markov chain (180) is indeed the result of the Metropolis\u2013Hastings procedure. In particular, \u00b5\u2039 is an invariant distribution of the Markov chain. Second, one needs to prove the spectral gap inequality (182). The strategy is a variant of the one used in [40] to prove the spectral gap property of the pCN method, by applying the weak Harris theorem from [39].\nProof of Theorem 9.3. \u201a Verification of the Metropolis\u2013Hastings formulation. Let us introduce the general formulation of the Metropolis\u2013Hastings MCMC method, see\nfor instance [29]. Let ` qxp\u00a8q \u02d8\nxPH denote the proposal kernel, and introduce two probability\ndistributions \u03b7 and \u03b7K on H2, defined as follows: for any bounded and measurable function \u03c6 : H2 \u00d1 R, set\n\u0133 \u03c6px, yqd\u03b7px, yq \u201c \u0133\n\u03c6px, yqdqxpyqd\u00b5\u2039pxq \u0133\n\u03c6px, yqd\u03b7Kpx, yq \u201c \u0133 \u03c6px, yqdqypxqd\u00b5\u2039pyq.\nUnder the condition that the probability distributions \u03b7 and \u03b7K are equivalent, define the acceptance probability by\napx, x\u0302q \u201c minp1, d\u03b7 K\nd\u03b7 px, x\u0302qq,\nfor all x, x\u0302 P H , where d\u03b7K d\u03b7 : H2 \u00d1 R denotes the Radon-Nikodym derivative. Then, the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm is well-defined, and \u00b5\u2039 is invariant for the resulting Markov chain.\nLet \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q. The objective is to check that if the proposal kernel is defined using the modified Euler scheme with time-step size \u03c4 , then the associated distributions \u03b7 and \u03b7K are equivalent and to compute the Radon-Nikodym derivative. Owing to the definition (2.3) of the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039, one has\nd\u03b7px, yq \u201c dqxpyqZ\u00b41e\u00b42V pxqd\u03bdpxq \u201c Z\u00b41e\u00b42V pxqd\u03b70px, yq d\u03b7Kpx, yq \u201c dqypxqZ\u00b41e\u00b42V pyqd\u03bdpyq \u201c Z\u00b41e\u00b42V pyqd\u03b7K0 px, yq\nwhere \u03b70 and \u03b7 K 0 are centered Gaussian distributions on H 2. Due to the fact that the Gaussian distribution \u03bd is preserved by the modified Euler scheme in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck case, for any value of the time-step size \u03c4 , it is straightforward to check that the covariance operators of the Gaussian distributions \u03b70 and \u03b7 K 0 are identical, hence \u03b70 \u201c \u03b7K0 . As a consequence, \u03b7\nand \u03b7K are equivalent and one obtains the expression (181) for the acceptance probability. This concludes the first step of the proof, namely the verification of the Metropolis\u2013Hastings structure of the Markov chain (180). In particular, the chain is reversible with respect to the probability distribution \u00b5\u2039, which is thus an invariant distribution.\n\u201a Application of the weak Harris theorem. The objective is to show that the weak Harris theorem [39] can be applied. The arguments of the proof follow those use in [40]. To simplify notation, the time-step size parameter \u03c4 is omitted in the sequel. It is worth mentioning that the values of the auxiliary parameters introduced below may depend on \u03c4 .

The functions d\u03b5p\u00a8, \u00a8q and d\u0303\u03b5p\u00a8, \u00a8q defined above are referred to as the Wasserstein distance-like functions associated with the functions d\u03b5 and d\u0303\u03b5 respectively.\nTo apply the weak Harris theorem, it suffices to check that there exists \u03b5 P p0, 1q such that the three following claims hold.\n\u201a Lyapunov structure: there exists \u2113 P p0, 1q and C P p0,8q such that for all x P H one has\n(183) Pp| \u00a8 |2qpxq \u010f \u2113|x|2 ` C. \u201a d-contraction: there exists c P p0, 1q such that for all x, y P H with d\u03b5px, yq \u0103 1, one\nhas\n(184) d\u03b5pPpx, \u00a8q,Ppx, \u00a8qq \u010f cd\u03b5px, yq. \u201a d-smallness (of balls): for any R P p0,8q, there exist NR P N and sR P p0, 1q such\nthat\n(185) sup |x|\u010fR,|y|\u010fR\nd\u03b5pPNRpx, \u00a8q,PNRpy, \u00a8qq \u010f sR.\nThe application of the weak Harris theorem then provides the following result: there exists n\u0303 P N such that for any probability distribution \u00b5 on H , one has\n(186) d\u0303\u03b5p\u00b5Pn\u0303, \u00b5\u2039q \u010f 1\n2 d\u0303\u03b5p\u00b5, \u00b5\u2039q.\n\u201a Proof of the Lyapunov structure property (183).

This concludes the proof of the d-smallness property (185). \u201a Having proved the three claims (183), (184) and (185), the weak Harris theorem can be applied and yiels the estimate (186). The spectral gap inequality (182) is obtained as a consequence of the estimate (186) above using the same arguments as in [40]. The details are omitted.\n\u201a The proof of Theorem 9.3 is thus completed. Remark 9.4. The Markov chain `\nX \u03c4 n\n\u02d8\nn\u011b0 may also be seen as a metropolized integrator\nin order to approximate the solution of the SPDE (21) at any time T (with N\u03c4 \u201c T ), when the nonlinearity F satisfies Assumption 4.

Note that computing `\nX \u03c4 n\n\u02d8\nn\u011b0 (given by the\nMCMC method (180)) requires to evaluate the mapping V , whereas computing ` X\u03c4n \u02d8\nn\u011b0 (given by the modified Euler scheme (29)) requires to evaluate F \u201c \u00b4DV .\nMetropolized integrators for SDEs have been studied in [7] for instance. The analysis in the infinite dimensional case is not a straightforward extension of the arguments above and is thus left open for future work.\n9.2.3. Comparisons with the standard and exponential Euler schemes. To conclude this subsection concerning MCMC methods to approximate integrals \u015f\n\u03d5d\u00b5\u2039, let us study the behavior of the Metropolis\u2013Hastings Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms obtained using either the exponential or the standard Euler scheme, instead of the modified Euler scheme, as the proposal kernel. Let ` \u0393n \u02d8\nn\u011b0 be a sequence of independent cylindrical H-valued Gaussian\nrandom variables, and ` Un \u02d8\nn\u011b0 be a sequence of independent random variables which are\nuniformly distributed on r0, 1s, such that the two sequences are independent. On the one hand, a well-defined Metropolis\u2013Hastings MCMC method is obtained when the proposal kernel is the accelerated exponential Euler scheme. For all \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q, set\n(187)\n$\n&\n%\nX\u0302 \u03c4,e n`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039bX\u03c4,en `\n`1\n2 pI \u00b4 e\u00b42\u03c4\u039bq \u02d8 1 2\u0393n\nX \u03c4,e n`1 \u201c 1Un\u010fapX\u03c4,en ,X\u0302\u03c4,en`1qX\u0302 \u03c4,e n`1 ` 1Un\u0105apX\u03c4,en ,X\u0302\u03c4,en`1qX \u03c4,e n ,\nwhere the acceptance probability is defined by (181). The Markov chain `\nX \u03c4,e n\n\u02d8\nn\u011b0 satisfies\nthe results stated in Theorem 9.3 for the modified Euler scheme, for any value \u03c4 P p0, \u03c40q of the time-step size. The proof is omitted, since the arguments are similar. The result is not suprising: indeed the accelerated exponential Euler scheme preserves the Gaussian invariant distribution \u03bd in the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck case, since it is exact in distribution at all times. The convergence to the equilibrium is also exponentially fast (contrary to the Crank\u2013Nicolson method which preserves the invariant distribution but is not L-stable). The comparison of the modified Euler scheme and of the (accelerated) exponential Euler scheme leads to the same conclusions as in the other parts of this article: the convergence results are identical for the two methods, however the modified Euler scheme does not require the knowledge of the eigendecomposition of the linear operator \u039b and may thus be applied in greater generality than the exponential Euler method.\nOn the other hand, using the standard Euler scheme is not appropriate. More precisely, set\n(188)\n# X\u0302 \u03c4,st n`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b ` X \u03c4,st n ` ? \u03c4\u0393n \u02d8\nX \u03c4,st n`1 \u201c 1Un\u010fapX\u03c4,stn ,X\u0302\u03c4,stn`1qX\u0302 \u03c4,st n`1 ` 1Un\u0105apX\u03c4,stn ,X\u0302\u03c4,stn`1qX \u03c4,st n ,\nwhere the acceptance probability is defined by (181). The scheme above cannot be interpreted as a Metropolis\u2013Hastings MCMC method which targets the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039: in fact, the general rule which provides the acceptance ratio is ill-defined in the infinite dimensional situation, due to singularity of the Gaussian distributions appearing in its definition. This is another illustration of the superiority of the modified Euler scheme over the standard Euler method.\nObserve that the Markov chain defined by (188) can be interpreted as a Metropolis\u2013 Hastings MCMC method which targets the modified Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u03c4\u2039 defined by (59) (see Section 4.4 and in particular Theorem 4.11). Since the targetted distribution is not independent of the auxiliary time-step size parameter \u03c4 , the benefits of using a MCMC method compared with a standard integrator are not recovered. Note that a variant of Theorem 9.3 is expected to hold for the method defined by (188) if one considers the target distribution \u00b5\u03c4\u2039.\n9.3. Application to other SPDE systems. The main results stated in Section 4 concerning the modified Euler scheme are stated and proved in the framework described in Section 2, and are restricted to a particular class of stochastic evolution equations of the type (21): parabolic semilinear stochastic PDEs, in a bounded one-dimensional domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, driven by additive Gaussian space-time white noise. The objective of this subsection is to suggest possible extensions of the definition of the modified Euler scheme. In the more general framework, the proposed scheme satisfies the following results.\n\u201a Theorem 4.2 is satisfied by construction of the scheme, which means that the spatial regularity of the solution is preserved by the numerical approximation, for any value of the time-step size. However, Theorem 4.1 does not always hold. \u201a Theorem 4.4 may not hold. Indeed, this result requires that the invariant distribution \u00b58 of (21) is equal to the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039, and that this is also the\ninvariant distribution of the modified equation (35). This crucial property is not satisfied for instance when the equation is driven by colored noise. \u201a Theorem 4.8 always hold, with an order of convergence which depends on the considered problem.\nThree generalizations are studied below, they may of course be combined to consider other generalizations which are omitted. Note also that we only consider homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, however Neumann or periodic boundary conditions may be also considered.\n9.3.1. SPDEs with one-sided Lipschitz nonlinearities. A first possible generalization is to weaken Assumption 2, which requires the nonlinearity F to be globally Lipschitz continuous. In this section, it is assumed only that F pxq \u201c fpxp\u00a8qq is defined as a Nemytskii operator, such that the real-valued function f satisfies a one-sided Lipschitz condition (but is not globally Lipschitz continuous):\n(189) sup zPR\nf 1pzq \u0103 8.\nIt is also required to assume that f has at most polynomial growth. In this setting, the stochastic evolution equation\n(190) dXptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bXptqdt ` F pXptqqdt ` dW ptq, Xp0q \u201c x0, is of the same form as (21). When fpxq \u201c x \u00b4 x3, this gives the stochastic Allen\u2013Cahn equation.\nThe modified Euler scheme (29) cannot be applied to the stochastic evolution equation (190): since the nonlinearity F is not globally Lipschitz continuous and may have superlinear growth, a standard explicit discretization of the nonlinearity leads to a scheme which does not satisfy moment bounds as given in Lemma 5.8.\nWhen the flow pt, zq \u00de\u00d1 \u03c6tpzq of the nonlinear ordinary differential equation 9z \u201c fpzq is known, which is the case for the Allen\u2013Cahn equation, a splitting scheme can be designed: with the same notation as in the definition of the modified Euler scheme (29), set (191) X\u03c4n`1 \u201c A\u03c4\u03a6\u03c4 pX\u03c4nq ` B\u03c4,1 ? \u03c4\u0393n,1 ` B\u03c4,2 ? \u03c4\u0393n,2, where \u03a6\u03c4 pxq \u201c \u03c6\u03c4 pxq for all x P H .

For instance, the splitting scheme (191) is a generalization of the scheme studied in [18]. The fully implicit scheme (193) is a generalization of the scheme studied in [31]. The tamed scheme (194) is a generalization of the scheme studied in [14]. For all the schemes, the result of Theorem 4.2 still holds, for any value of the time-step size \u03c4 . In addition, note that the splitting scheme (191) and the split-step scheme (192) can both be interpreted in terms of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to a modified stochastic evolution equation of the type\ndX\u03c4ptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4X\u03c4 ptqdt ` Q\u03c4\u03a8\u03c4 pX\u03c4 ptqqdt ` Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW ptq\nwith a modified nonlinearity \u03a8\u03c4 . In the splitting scheme case, \u03a8\u03c4 pxq \u201c \u03c4\u00b41p\u03a6\u03c4 pxq \u00b4 xq. Similarly, the tamed scheme (194) can be interpreted in terms of the tamed accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to the modified stochastic evolution equation (35), i. e. with \u03a8\u03c4 \u201c F . The analysis of the fully implicit scheme (193) would require different arguments.\nTo prove a version of Theorem 4.8, giving weak error estimates of the type \u02c7\n\u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 Er\u03d5pXpT qqs \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u01ebpT, x0q\u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u01eb`~\u03d5~1 ` ~\u03d5~2 \u02d8\nfor functions \u03d5 of class C2 and all fixed T P p0,8q, one needs to modify the proof of Lemma 5.5 and of Lemma 5.10, which give regularity estimates for the solutions u\u03c4 and u of Kolmogorov equations. We refer to [18, Theorems 4.1 and 4.2], see also [30].\nIn the ergodic case, a version of Theorem 4.4, which gives weak error estimates of the type\n\u02c7 \u02c7Er\u03d5pX\u03c4Nqs \u00b4 \u017c \u03d5d\u00b5\u2039 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u010f C\u01ebpx0q~\u03d5~ \u00b4 \u03c4 1 2 \u00b4\u01eb ` e\u00b4\u03baN\u03c4 \u00af\nfor functions \u03d5 which are only bounded and continuous (or equivalently an error estimate in the total variation distance), can be proved for the splitting scheme (191) and for the splitstep scheme (192). This generalization requires to replace Assumption 3 by the condition\nsup zPR\nf 1pzq \u0103 \u03bb1\nand to prove versions of Lemma 5.6 and of Lemma 5.11: this is straightforward, we refer for instance to [14, Proposition 6.1]. One also needs to prove uniform moment bounds of the type (101), in L8 norms instead of H \u201c L2 norms. For the tamed scheme (194), the arguments from [14] maye be generalized. Note that the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039 defined by (25) is also the unique invariant distribution of the stochastic evolution equation (190) even if f is only one-sided Lipschitz continuous (and satisfies the ergodicity condition above). This is why a version of Theorem 4.4 is expected to hold also in the non globally Lipschitz case described above.\nThis concludes the description of the non-globally Lipschitz case. 9.3.2. SPDEs with colored noise. The framework described in Section 2 is restricted to consider stochastic evolution equations (21) where \u00b4\u039b is an elliptic second-order operator in dimension 1 and where ` W ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is a cylindrical Wiener process, i. e. the system is driven by space-time white noise. In this subsection, we explain how the modified Euler scheme can be applied to equations in higher dimension and/or driven by colored noise, and what are the expected results in those situations.\nOn the one hand, for any dimension d P N, \u00b4\u039b can be defined such that \u00b4\u039bxp\u00a8q \u201c div ` ap\u00a8q\u2207xp\u00a8q \u02d8\nfor all x P Dp\u039bq \u201c H10 pp0, 1qdq Y H2pp0, 1qdq, where a : r0, 1sd \u00d1 apxq \u201c pai1,i2pxq \u02d8\n1\u010fi1,i2\u010fd is\nsmooth and the ellipticity condition min zPr0,1sd min \u03bePRd\napxq\u03be\u00a8\u03be \u03be\u00a8\u03be \u0105 0 is satisfied, where \u00a8 denotes the\ninner product in Rd. In this setting, Assumption 1 needs to be modified: one has \u03bbj \u201e cj 2 d when j \u00d1 8. On the other hand, let the Q-Wiener process ` WQptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 be defined as follows. Let `\nqj \u02d8 jPN be a sequence of non-negative real numbers and ` ej \u02d8 jPN be a complete orthonormal\nsystem of H . The linear operator Q and Q 1 2 are given by\nQx \u201c \u00ff\njPN qjxx, ejyej, Q 1 2x \u201c\n\u00ff\njPN\n? qjxx, ejyej,\nand for all t \u011b 0 set WQptq \u201c \u00ff\njPN\n? qj\u03b2jptqej\nwhere ` \u03b2j \u02d8\njPN is a sequence of independent standard real-valued Wiener processes.\nThe stochastic evolution equation driven by additive colored noise\n(195) dXptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bXptqdt ` F pXptqqdt ` dWQptq, Xp0q \u201c x0, is well-posed when the covariance operator Q satisfies a condition of the type\n\u017c T\n0\n}e\u00b4t\u039bQ 12 }2 L2pHqdt \u0103 8\nis satisfied, where we recall that } \u00a8 }L2pHq denotes the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. Owing to the smoothing property (16), a sufficient condition is the existence of \u03b1 \u0105 0 such that\n(196) }\u039b 2\u03b1\u00b412 Q 12 }L2pHq \u0103 8. When Q \u201c I (cylindrical Wiener process/space-time white noise), the condition above holds when d \u201c 1 (with \u03b1 P r0, 1\n4 q), but is not satisfied if d \u011b 2. To consider equations in dimension\nd \u011b 2, the system needs to be driven colored noise, i. e. Q \u2030 I. In the trace-class noise case, meaning that TrpQq \u201c }Q 12 }2\nL2pHq \u201c \u0159 jPN qj \u0103 8, the condition (196) holds for \u03b1 \u201c 12 . In general, the range of values of \u03b1 such that (196) holds depends both on the covariance operator Q and on the dimension d.\nTo discretize the stochastic evolution equation (195) driven by additive colored noise, the definition of the modified Euler scheme is modified as follows:\n(197) X\u03c4n`1 \u201c A\u03c4 ` X\u03c4n ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4nq \u02d8 ` B\u03c4,1 ? \u03c4\u0393 Q n,1 ` B\u03c4,2 ? \u03c4\u0393 Q n,2,\nwhere the operators A\u03c4 , B\u03c4,1 and B\u03c4,2 are defined by (30), and the Gaussian random variables \u0393 Q n,1 and \u0393 Q n,2 are defined as follows:\n\u0393 Q n,i \u201c\n\u00ff\njPN\n? qj\u03b3n,i,jej,\nwhere ` \u03b3n,i,j \u02d8\nnPN0,iPt1,2u,jPN are independent standard real-valued random variables.\nIf the covariance operator Q and the linear operator \u039b commute (commutative noise case), the interpretations of the modified Euler scheme presented in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3\nare valid also for the scheme (197). In particular, the scheme (197) can be interpreted as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme\n(198) X\u03c4,n`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4X\u03c4,n ` \u039b\u00b41\u03c4 pI \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u03c4 qQ\u03c4F pX\u03c4,nq ` \u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4sq\u039b\u03c4Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW Qpsq\napplied to the modified stochastic evolution equation\n(199) dX\u03c4 ptq \u201c \u00b4\u039b\u03c4X\u03c4 ptqdt ` Q\u03c4F pX\u03c4 ptqqdt ` Q 1 2 \u03c4 dW Qptq,\nwhere the linear operators \u039b\u03c4 , Q\u03c4 and Q 1 2 \u03c4 are given by (39).\nHowever, when the operators Q and \u039b do not commute, the interpretations of the modified Euler scheme presented in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3 are not valid for the scheme (197). Indeed, the covariance operator of the Gaussian random variable B\u03c4,1\u0393 Q n,1 ` B\u03c4,2\u0393Qn,2 is equal to `\nB\u03c4,1Q 1 2 \u02d8` B\u03c4,1Q 1 2 \u02d8\u2039 ` ` B\u03c4,2Q 1 2 \u02d8` B\u03c4,2Q 1 2 \u02d8\u2039 \u201c B\u03c4,1QB\u03c4,1 ` B\u03c4,2QB\u03c4,2 and is different from ` B\u03c4Q 1 2 \u02d8` B\u03c4Q 1 2\n\u02d8\u2039 \u201c B\u03c4QB\u03c4 , where the linear operator B\u03c4 is defined by (31) and satisfies B2\u03c4 \u201c B2\u03c4,1 ` B2\u03c4,2.\nLet us now describe how the results of Section 4 need to be modified in the case of stochastic evolution equations driven by additive colored noise.\nFirst, Theorem 4.1 remains valid in the commutative noise case, with straightforward modifications of the proof, however it may not be satisfied in the non-commutative noise case. Second, Theorem 4.2 holds in the general case, with a modification of the range of values \u03b1 P r0, 1\n4 q in (iii): instead, one needs to consider the interval of values of \u03b1 such that\nthe condition (196) is satisfied. Concerning error estimates in the total variation distance, Theorem 4.4 does not hold in general: indeed, when Assumption 4 is satisfied, the invariant distribution of (195) is not the Gibbs distribution \u00b5\u2039. It is conjectured that a version of Theorem 4.4 holds if Q is assumed to commute with \u039b, if the nonlinearity is assumed to satisfy the condition F \u201c \u00b4QDV and if a suitable non-degeneracy condition is satisfied. A modification of Assumption 5 may also be needed, as discussed below. As explained above, considering the commutative noise case is required to interpret the modified Euler scheme (197) in terms of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme (198) applied to the modified stochastic evolution equation (199). The condition F \u201c \u00b4QDV implies that the invariant distribution of (195) and of (199) is equal to a Gibbs distribution\nd\u00b5\u2039,Qpxq \u201c Z\u00b41Q e\u00b42V pxqd\u03bdQpxq where \u03bdQ is the Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and covariance operator Q\u039b\n2 (which is the\ninvariant distribution of (195) when F \u201c 0). Finally, a non-degeneracy condition is required to prove versions of Lemmas 5.7 and 5.12, which give regularity results for the derivatives Du\u03c4pt, \u00a8q and Dupt, \u00a8q, for t \u0105 0, when the initial value \u03d5 \u201c u\u03c4 p0, \u00a8q \u201c up0, \u00a8q is only assumed to be bounded and continuous. Precise statement and proofs are omitted and left for future work.\nIn the general case, a version of Theorem 4.8 is conjectured to hold for the modified Euler scheme (199) applied to the stochastic evolution equation (195) driven by additive colored noise. Note that the order of convergence depends on the values of \u03b1 such that the condition (196) is satisfied. For instance, the weak order of convergence is expected to be\nequal to 1 in the trace-class noise case. Similarly, a version of Theorem 4.9 is conjectured to hold in the ergodic case (when Assumption 3 is satisfied).\nNote that a tool of the proof of weak error estimates in Sections 6 is Assumption 5, which gives a regularity condition on the nonlinearity F , in order to exploit the temporal regularity, with H\u00f6lder exponent 2\u03b1 of the solutions in the norm |\u039b\u00b4\u03b1 \u00a8 |, for all \u03b1 P r0, 1\n4 q,\nsee for instance (105) from Lemma 5.9. This argument is well-suited for stochastic evolution equations in dimension 1 driven by space-time white noise. On the one hand, the arguments in Section 2.4 to check that Assumption 5 is satisfied for the example of Nemytskii operators, exploit Sobolev type inequalities which are valid only in dimension 1. On the other hand, the argument is not sufficient to exhibit orders of convergence larger than 1{2, since the H\u00f6lder regularity of the solutions is smaller than 1{2. As a consequence, other arguments are needed, for instance to treat the trace-class noise case.\nIt is worth mentioning that in the non commutative noise case, applying the accelerated exponential Euler scheme to the stochastic evolution equation (195) is not feasible: it is not sufficient to know the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operators \u039b and Q to sample exactly Gaussian random variables\n\u017c tn`1\ntn\ne\u00b4ptn`1\u00b4tq\u039bdWQptq.\nUsing an approximation of the type ? \u03c4e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b\u0393Qn leads to define a non-accelerated exponential Euler scheme of the type\nX \u03c4,e n`1 \u201c e\u00b4\u03c4\u039b ` X\u03c4,en ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4,en ` ? \u03c4\u0393Qn \u02d8\nFor that scheme, Theorems 4.2 and 4.12 are not valid, even when F \u201c 0, and even in the commutative case: the resulting scheme does not preserve the regularity of the solution. On the contrary, the modified Euler scheme (197) is applicable in the non-commutative noise case and Theorem 4.2 is satisfied. In that case, the modified Euler scheme is thus qualitatively superior to the (non-accelerated) exponential Euler scheme.\nThis concludes the description of the colored noise case. 9.3.3. SPDEs with non-additive noise. Finally, it is possible to generalize the definition of the modified Euler scheme, to be applied to stochastic evolution equations driven by multiplicative (or non-additive) noise:\n(200) dXptq \u201c \u00b4\u039bXptqdt ` F pXptqqdt ` \u03c3pXptqqdW ptq, Xp0q \u201c x0, where \u03c3 is a function from H to LpHq, assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous. For instance, \u03c3 may be defined as a Nemytskii operator, in the setting of Section 2.4. In addition, `\nW ptq \u02d8\nt\u011b0 is a cylindrical Wiener process, however it would also be possible to consider Q-\nWiener processes, under a condition of the type (196). In that situation, the modified Euler scheme applied to (200) is defined as\n(201) X\u03c4n`1 \u201c A\u03c4 ` X\u03c4n ` \u03c4F pX\u03c4nq \u02d8 ` B\u03c4,1 ? \u03c4\u03c3pX\u03c4nq\u0393n,1 ` B\u03c4,2 ? \u03c4\u03c3pX\u03c4nq\u0393n,2.\nFirst of all, even if the nonlinearity F satisfies Assumption 4, there is no known expression for the invariant distribution (200) (which is unique when a version of Assumption 3 is satisfied). Moreover, like in the case of equations driven by colored noise when the covariance operator does not commute with \u039b, in general the modified Euler scheme (201) cannot be interpreted in terms of the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to a modified\nstochastic evolution equation of the type (35). As a consequence of the two observations above, Theorem 4.4 is not expected to hold in the multiplicative noise case, since two of the main arguments of the proof are not applicable. Note also that Theorem 4.12 does not hold in general for equations driven by multiplicative noise. Indeed, in the multiplicative noise case, the accelerated exponential Euler method cannot be implemented and the nonaccelerated exponential Euler method suffers from the same issues as the standard linear Euler method. Whether it is possible to prove error estimates in the total variation distance for either the modified Euler scheme (201) or an exponential Euler scheme when applied to (200) is an open question.\nLike in the other situations described above, the main benefit of applying the modified Euler scheme (201) over existing methods \u2013 standard Euler scheme and (non-accelerated) exponential Euler scheme \u2013 is the validity of Theorem 4.2: the modified Euler scheme preserves the spatial regularity of the solution, for any choice of the time-step size \u03c4 .\nVersion of Theorems 4.8 and 4.9, to state weak error estimates in the d2 distance, i. e. for functions \u03d5 of class C2, could be obtained also for the modified Euler scheme (201) applied to (200). As explained above, the interpretation of the modified Euler scheme in terms of an exponential Euler scheme applied to a modified stochastic evolution equation is not valid in the multiplicative noise case, and the analysis of the weak error needs to be performed the same approaches as used in the analysis of the standard Euler scheme. Note that the main difficulty in the analysis of the multiplicative noise case compared with the additive noise case is the proof of Lemma 5.10, which gives regularity results for the first and second order derivatives of the solution u of the Kolmogorov equation associated with (200): we refer to [15]. The detailed analysis of the weak error for the scheme (201) is not considered.\nThis concludes the description of the multiplicative noise case.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author warmly thanks Gilles Vilmart for crucial discussions about the construction of the proposed method at an early stage of this work, and Arnaud Debussche for the suggestion to state and prove Theorem 4.11.
