Inhibition of MCM7 may lead to a significant reduction in cancer-associated cell\nproliferation. Despite such significance of MCM7 in cancer, the protein structure is yet to be resolved\nexperimentally. This significantly halts the structure-guided ligand designing for cancer therapy targeting\nthe MCM7. The present study aims to resolve the tertiary structure of MCM7 and repurpose the FDA-\napproved clinically used drugs for cancer therapy by targeting MCM7 protein. The secondary and 3D\nstructures of MCM7 were generated using multiple bioinformatics tools, including the Self-Optimized\nPrediction Method with Alignment (SOPMA), SWISS-MODEL, and I-TASSER. The reliability of the modeled\nstructure was assessed using PROCHECK. Initially, a structure-guided virtual screening was performed\non the approved drug library to identify potential hits against MCM7. The detailed molecular mechanism\nof receptor interactions of the identified hits was evaluated using extensive molecular dynamics\nsimulation. The results from this study reveal an intriguing discovery of the potential of ergocalciferol\n(vitamin D2), cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), ergosterol (precursor of vitamin D2) and menaquinone (vitamin\nK2) as oncoprotein inhibitors for cancer therapy via inhibition of MCM7."

Such impediment to cytotoxic chemotherapy with adverse clinical side effects warrants the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents.16 The recent developments in the process of drug discovery have uncovered the potential of many non-cytotoxic drugs in targeted cancer therapy.17 Even though phytochemicals as lead compounds for chemotherapy have gained widespread interest in the scientic community, signicant challenges still exist. It lies in identifying, extracting, and characterizing natural phytochemicals, determining their potential target sites, and formulating effective workows for evaluating drug potency, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties (PK).18 In experiments involving de novo drug design or phytochemicals, the lead compounds from virtual screening undergo ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) trials to assess their potential for adverse clinical side effects. In the case of drug repurposing using FDAapproved commercial drugs, no additional pharmacokinetics or toxicity testing is required.19 This exponentially reduces the timeline for applying these drugs to treat new diseases, with the most contemporary example being remdesivir (a drug developed for the Ebola virus) being employed to treat COVID-19.20,21\nThe recent advances in drug designing methods enable efficient compound screening, identify probable target sites, and repurpose drugs against a specic molecule.22,23 The application of molecular docking in virtual screening platforms aided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enables identifying new leads with reasonable accuracy against a particular target.24,25 A previous study by our research team discovered the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

We considered ve different systems: MCM7, MCM7-cholecalciferol, MCM7-ergosterol, MCM7-ergocalciferol, and MCM7-menaquinone. Parameters for all ligands were generated according to the general Amber force eld (GAFF), and atomic charges for ligands were computed with the help of the AM1-BCC method using ANTECHAMBER tools. Parameters for ligands compatible with GROMACS were then generated using the ACPYPE program. Each systemwas solvated in a triclinic box such that at least 10 A was the minimum distance maintained between box walls and any protein atom. The initial box dimensions of all the systems were 93.4 \u00d7 145.8 \u00d7 108 A3. Charges in the simulated system were neutralized by the addition of six Na+ ions. The solvated systems were subjected to 500 steps of energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm. The energy minimized systems were subjected to position restrained simulation for 1 ns in the NVT ensemble. The protein backbone atoms were restrained, but solvent molecules could move freely. Each system was equilibrated initially for 2 ns in the NVT ensemble at 298 K, followed by another 2 ns simulation in the NPT ensemble (298 K, 1 bar). The nal production runs were carried out for 300 ns in the NPT ensemble. A Nose\u2013Hoover thermostat with a coupling time constant of 0.1 ps. was used to keep the temperature xed at 298 K.

            "text": "Secondary structure prediction is an essential step in the accurate prediction of the tertiary structure of a protein which is required for molecular docking.35 The amino acid sequence of MCM7was extracted fromUniProt in FASTA format (UniProt ID: P33993). The secondary structure of MCM7 protein was analyzed by SOPMA (Fig. S2\u2020). The secondary structure of MCM7 is primarily helical, with 49.65% a-helix followed by random coils (32.27%) and extended strands (13.77%). It also showed the presence of 4.31% of beta-turns.\nThe prediction of the 3D model for MCM7 started with a sequence similarity search using NCBI protein BLAST (https:// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi),36 keeping PDB (Protein Data Bank) as the template database.37 Based on a 100% sequence identity score for the input query sequence, the PDB crystal structure 6XTX was selected for further evaluation38 (Fig. 2A). The crystal structure is of human MCM7 protein as Chain F in conjunction with the hexameric MCM\u2013CMG complex. Therefore, chain F from the complex was isolated from the rest of the complex using BIOVIA DSV (Fig. 2B). The MCM7 protein structure contains 4 large missing sections, which were modelled using the SWISS-MODEL and the I-TASSER molecular threading webserver (Fig. 2C).27,29 The nal structure thus retrieved was further processed in AutoDock MGL Tools 1.5.6 to remove water molecules and add polar hydrogen groups for molecular docking.\nThe validation of the predicted MCM7 3D structure ensured the correctness of the predicted model. The 3D model showed no error that could lead to steric hindrance. The validation of the predicted MCM7 model is rst performed by the superposition or alignment of the predicted model with the experimentally resolved structure obtained from the PDB, depicted in Fig. 2D. The resulting alignment or RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) score was 0.77 A, signicantly less than the 2 A threshold value. The low RMSD score indicates the close resemblance of MCM7 predicted complete structure with its experimentally validated structure with the missing region.\nThe revalidation of the predicted model by analyzing its Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK on the SAVES V6.0 server revealed that 82% of the amino acid residues are present in the most favorable regions, 15% in the allowed regions, 1.9% in the generously allowed regions, and 1.1% in the disallowed regions. Therefore, out of a total of 719 residues, 711 residues (98.9%) were found present in the allowed regions, while only 8 residues (1.1%) were located within the disallowed regions (Fig. S3\u2020). None of these residues present in the disallowed regions are in the modelled loop regions or in the active sites of MCM7. Thus, it cannot impart any severe error during the molecular docking process. These results conrmed the accuracy of the predicted 3D model, and thus it was selected for the molecular docking procedure.

Root mean square deviation (RMSD) highlights the conformational changes of the protein aer ligand binding. The effect of different ligand binding on the conformational changes of the MCM7 over the entire simulation timescale is shown in Fig. 6A. The RMSD of the Ca atoms reects the stability of the system. The free and ligand-bound MCM7 changes during the initial 100 ns timescale. Aer that, all the systems attend stability. The average Ca RMSD uctuations of the protein over the simulation timescale are 0.838 0.154 nm, 0.964 0.175 nm, 0.892 0.11 nm, 0.929 0.148 nm, 0.75 0.066 nm for MCM7, MCM7-ergosterol, MCM7-ergocalciferol, MCM7-cholecalciferol and MCM7-menaquinone, respectively. As apparent from the gure, the binding of menaquinone signicantly stabilizes the protein.\n3.5.2 Radius of gyration. The shape and compactness of a structure are determined by the radius of gyration (Rg). MCM7 had an average Rg of 3.428 0.04 nm (Fig. 6B). The binding of ergosterol to MCM7 does not alter the size and shape of the protein (average Rg of 3.417 0.035 nm), which indicates that the shape of the protein remains the same aer ergosterol binding. However, the binding of ergocalciferol increases the size and shape of MCM7. The average Rg value obtained from the equilibrium simulation for MCM7-ergocalciferol is 3.599 0.07 nm. MCM7-menaquinone complex also shows a signicantly higher Rg of 3.552 0.054 nm. The higher Rg values indicate the uncoiling of some regions of the protein. MCM7cholecalciferol complex had slightly lower Rg values than the free protein, 3.396 0.06 nm (Fig. 6B). This indicates decreased protein uctuation upon cholecalciferol binding.\n3.5.3 RMSF. The effect of individual ligand binding to the MCM7 protein on the uctuation of each residue has been analyzed using the root mean square uctuation (RMSF) analysis (Fig. 7A). RMSF plot shows that the free protein has some regions of high residue uctuations apart from the terminal ends. The complexes had lower RMSF values than the protein, except for a few exible regions like 300\u2013350 and 480\u2013700. Interestingly, ligands bind to these regions.

MCM7-ergosterol complex displays the most increased uctuations in this region.\n3.5.4 Principal component analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) is an efficient data reduction technique that can effectively mine large-scale functional motions from complex simulation trajectories. The atomic position uctuation matrix was then computed from the trajectories. Eigenvectors with associated eigenvalues were obtained through matrix diagonalization. The essential subspace is then computed by projecting the simulation trajectory along each principal component. 2157 eigenvectors are used to dene the observed variance from the simulated trajectories. The trace of the diagonalized covariance matrix indicates the overall exibility of the protein. Of the four MCM7\u2013ligand complexes, only the MCM7-menaquinone shows a lower trace value indicating reduced exibility. It is noteworthy that this complex had the lowest Ca RMSD. As the rst two principal components (PC1 and PC2) explain most of the variance observed from the simulation, each trajectory is projected on the 2-D subspace computed by the rst two PCs. The results are shown in Fig. 7B. Conformational dynamics of the apo MCM7 and MCM7-cholecalciferol complex are very similar, as they occupy very similar spaces in the 2-D subspace (Fig. 7B). This indicates that the binding of cholecalciferol does not alter the functional dynamics of the protein. The conformational cluster occupied by the MCMmenaquinone and MCM7-ergocalciferol complexes partly overlap with the apo-protein conformational cluster. This indicates that the binding of these two ligands alters the functional motion of the protein. The most signicant impact has been observed when ergosterol binds to the MCM7. MCM7-ergosterol complex displays a wide distribution of the conformational ensemble, which does not overlap with the conformational landscape of the apo-protein. Thus,\ned from the MD simulation.

Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) is the surface area of a molecule exposed to the solvent. It is used for determining the stability of the free and bound protein. The total SASA of the unbound protein was\nFig. 9 (A) Hydrogen bond interaction patterns for each of the four MCM7 Variations of coulomb (B) and LJ (C) interaction energies between prote obtained from the simulations.\n31012 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 31004\u201331015\n381 nm2 (Fig. 8). Upon binding to ergocalciferol the SASA changes signicantly which indicates an alteration of the structure of the protein. In the case of MCM7-cholecalciferol binding, the SASA almost remained the same as the free protein (Fig. 8). MCM7-menaquinone complex and MCM7ergosterol complex show higher SASA values implying alteration of protein structure to some extent upon ligand binding.\n3.5.6 Hydrogen bonding, p\u2013alkyl and alkyl\u2013alkyl interactions. We then analyzed interactions between MCM7 with four different ligands from the simulation trajectories. All the ligands form hydrogen bonds with MCM7, apart from menaquinone (Fig. 9A). MCM7-ergosterol complex displayed two hydrogen bonds until 150 ns, but only one hydrogen bond later became stable. Hydrogen bonding interaction between MCM7 and ergocalciferol is strongly evident from the simulation data. One hydrogen bonding interaction is almost unperturbed throughout the simulation timescale. A second hydrogen bond between Lys351 and ergocalciferol is observed during the latter half of the simulation. Cholecalciferol primarily forms a single hydrogen bond with MCM7. Notably, docking studies also reveal a single hydrogen bond between Ile344 of MCM7 and cholecalciferol. In comparison, ergocalciferol forms two hydrogen bonds with Lys351 and Ile344 of MCM7, respectively.\nInterestingly, most of the weak interactions, p\u2013alkyl and alkyl\u2013alkyl, observed in all the ligand-MCM7 docked complexes are stable throughout the simulation trajectories.

The coulomb interaction energy pattern also follows the number and stability of hydrogen bonds. The most favorable coulomb interactions have been observed for the MCM7-ergocalciferol complex (\u221224 kJ mol\u22121). This complex exhibits the most stable MCM7\u2013 ligand hydrogen-bonding pattern. Consequently, the least favorable hydrogen bonding interactions have been observed for menaquinone, which does not form any hydrogen bond with MCM7. Short-range LJ interactions primarily dictate the binding of ergosterol, menaquinone, and cholecalciferol to MCM7 (Fig. 9B and C)."

            "text": "Overexpression of the MCM7 gene responsible for cancer progression can be restricted with chemotherapy targeting to inhibit its action. The presented study utilized molecular docking and MD simulation to identify four compounds (vitamins) as potential drug candidates: ergocalciferol, ergosterol, cholecalciferol, and menaquinone, which can inhibit MCM7 activity. A detailed analysis has been performed to delineate the mechanism of action of the identied hits. Ergocalciferol binds with MCM7 with the highest affinity and the MCM7-ergocalciferol complex is stabilized by electrostatic interactions. The hydrogen bonding interactions are the most stable among all the four studied compounds, evident from the simulation. RMSD, Rg and SASA calculation shows that the binding of ergocalciferol induces structural alteration of the protein, MCM7. Cholecalciferol and ergosterol bind with MCM7 with comparable affinities. Both of them share a very similar moderately stable hydrogen bonding prole. Their interaction energy proles are also very similar. The binding of both the compounds induces structural uctuations in the MCM7, evident from the high RMSD values. RMSF indicates binding of these two compounds induces uctuations in several loop regions. However, the overall shape and size of the protein remain unaltered, evident from similar Rg and SASA proles of these two ligand-bound complexes and free protein obtained from MD simulation. Menaquinone, on the other hand, shows the least binding affinity among the identied hits which is accounted for its inability to form hydrogen bonds. Its binding is primarily contributed by van der Waals interactions. It forms several weak alkyl\u2013alkyl interactions with the protein which are highly stable during the entire simulation timescale. Rg and SASA show that the binding of menaquinone to MCM7 altered the structural organization of the protein which leads to a change in functional motion of MCM7 (evident from the PCA analysis) which could lead to an altered MCM7 activity. In vitro and in vivo studies can be performed in the near future to investigate the chemotherapeutic efficacy of the selected drugs on MCM7-associated cancer progression.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
