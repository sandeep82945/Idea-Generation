1. **Investigate the effects of different membrane materials and configurations on the performance of the integrated membrane system.** This could involve testing different types of microfiltration, nanofiltration, and osmotic distillation membranes, as well as exploring different membrane configurations, such as series or parallel arrangements. The goal would be to optimize the system's performance in terms of juice quality, concentration factor, and energy efficiency.


2. **Evaluate the impact of different operating conditions on the quality of the concentrated juice.** This could involve varying the temperature, pressure, and flow rate of the juice and brine solutions, as well as the concentration factor of the pre-concentrated juice. The goal would be to determine the optimal operating conditions for producing a high-quality concentrated juice with minimal loss of bioactive compounds and sensory attributes.


3. **Explore the use of the integrated membrane system for the concentration of other types of fruit juices and plant extracts.** This could involve testing juices from different fruits, such as berries, citrus fruits, and tropical fruits, as well as extracts from herbs, spices, and vegetables. The goal would be to determine the applicability of the system to a wide range of products and to identify the key factors that affect the quality of the concentrated products.


4. **Investigate the potential of the concentrated juice as a functional food ingredient.** This could involve studying the effects of the juice on various health parameters, such as blood sugar control, lipid metabolism, and antioxidant status. The goal would be to determine the potential of the juice to improve human health and well-being.


5. **Develop a pilot-scale or industrial-scale integrated membrane system for the production of concentrated fruit juices and plant extracts.** This would involve scaling up the laboratory-scale system and optimizing the process for commercial production. The goal would be to produce a high-quality, shelf-stable concentrated juice that retains the nutritional and functional properties of the fresh juice.
