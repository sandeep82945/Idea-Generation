    "abstractText": "High-level Chinese cartographic developments predate European innovations by several centuries. Whereas European cartographic progress\u2014and in particular the search for a practical solution to the perennial \u2018longitude problem\u2019 at sea\u2014was driven by persistent economic motivations, Chinese mapmaking efforts responded predominantly to administrative, cadastral and topographic needs. Nevertheless, contemporary Chinese scholars and navigators, to some extent aided by experienced Arab navigators and astronomers, developed independent means of longitude determination both on land and at sea, using a combination of astronomical observations and timekeeping devices that continued to operate adequately on pitching and rolling ships. Despite confusing and speculative accounts in the current literature and sometimes overt nationalistic rhetoric, Chinese technical capabilities applied to longitude determination at sea, while different in design from European advances owing to cultural and societal circumstances, were at least on a par with those of their European counterparts.",

He is credited with defining the principles of scale, grid and triangulation, and also with standardising the representation of uneven heights on a plane surface. Yet, the ancient Chinese did not develop world maps. The earliest-known Chinese \u2018world map\u2019 is the Map of China and the Barbarian Countries (1136). However, this map is in reality a national map that only shows those areas of the Korean peninsula and Vietnam immediately adjacent to Chinese territory, with the names of other countries indicated in their approximate locations (e.g., Song and Chen, 1996). In fact, ancient Chinese maps were often not based on survey measurements but rather on a critical assessment of earlier maps, literary sources and personal observations (Yee, 1994; Sun, 2009).\nFigure 1.

Zh\u016b omitted some foreign countries from his map owing to a lack of reliable information:\nAs for the various foreign lands southeast of the South Sea and northwest of the great desert [Mongolia], although they at times send tribute to the court, their distance precludes investigation.

In fact, although evidence exists of Chinese monks having travelled to Japan more than a thousand years ago (e.g., Wei, 2005), that country does not appear on any early Chinese maps (Song and Chen, 1996). Similarly, Admiral Zh\u00e8ng H\u00e9 (\u912d\u548c; 1371\u20131433/5) never ventured eastwards into the Pacific during any of the seven voyages he undertook during the M\u00edng dynasty (1368\u20131644) (see Section 7; see also Duyvendak, 1939; Mills, 1970; Dreyer, 2007; but see Ptak, 2007, for scathing criticism of the latter publication). (For period reference, Table 1 provides a timeline of the ruling Chinese dynasties over the course of the historical developments discussed in this paper.)\nThe foundation of Chinese cartography was, instead, based on the country\u2019s agricultural needs. If anything, administrative policies encouraged agricultural enhancements while restricting commerce and discouraging overseas trade. Maps were developed primarily for land distribution, management of tax collection, military campaigns, urban defence, river and terrestrial transport, and water conservation. As a result, early Chinese maps were highly accurate, large-scale maps of small areas that were meant for cadastral, administrative and topographic purposes (e.g., Chao, 1978). As such, there was no need to determine accurate latitudes and longitudes, nor to correct map projections for the effects of the Earth\u2019s curvature (Song and Chen, 1996). Although they represented distances and topographical features very\naccurately, such early administrative or military maps often did not include grid patterns (e.g., Zhang, 2015: Chapter 2, note 48).\nNevertheless, Chinese navigators appear to have developed a rudimentary means of longitude determination during the Yu\u00e1n (1271/9\u20131368) and early M\u00edng dynasties (see Section 7). As we will see, ancient Chinese cartographers were already well versed in mapping their territory, which may explain why the Venetian merchant and explorer Marco Polo (1254\u20131324) was familiar with the longitude concept upon his return from China in the thirteenth century (e.g., Olshin, 2014).\nIt is often claimed that medieval Islamic developments influenced the development of Chinese geography under the thirteenth-century Mongol Empire and its successor state, the Yu\u00e1n dynasty. In fact, although the earliest influence of Islamic astronomy in China dates from 961 CE (J.-J. Chen, 1996: 52\u201366; Shi, 2014), i.e., during the S\u00f2ng dynasty (960\u2013 1271/9), it took until the rise of the Mongol Empire before Islamic influences in North Asia extended to cartography. However, there is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that home-grown Chinese cartographic advances predate those influences by more than a millennium. Indeed, the use of maps covered by rectangular (or square) grid patterns probably originated in China (Needham, 1986: 106\u2013107; for an opposing view, see Yee, 1994), most likely with the work of Zh\u0101ng H\u00e9ng 5 (\u5f35\u8861 ; 78\u2013139 CE) (Nelson, 1974: 357\u2013362; de Crespigny, 2007: 1049\u20131051; for a biography, see Trimble et al., 2007: 1264\u20131265). Zh\u0101ng, the leading polymath of the Later (Eastern) H\u00e0n dynasty (25\u2013220 CE), was an engineer, meteorologist, geologist and philosopher based in the H\u00e0n capital of Ch\u00e1ng\u2019\u0101n (present-day X\u012b\u2019\u0101n; the eastern extremity of the Maritime Silk Road). He was instrumental in advancing fields as disparate as astronomy, cartography, mathematics, philosophy and literature."

            "text": "Most relevant for our exploration of early Chinese cartography, Zh\u0101ng designed a waterdriven armillary sphere (see Figure 3), as well as a celestial globe, to track the movements of stars and planets, in support of his efforts to develop the h\u00f9nti\u0101n theory of cosmology. He published two leading treatises on that subject, The Spiritual (Sublime) Constitution of the Universe (120 CE) and Commentary (Treatise, Notes) on the Armillary Sphere (ca. 117 CE). In the latter manuscript, Zh\u0101ng described the geometry of the universe, comparing the heaven with the (spherical) shell of a hen\u2019s egg with Earth at its centre (e.g., Trimble et al., 2007).\nGiven the assumed sphericity of the heaven, spherical coordinates could be defined. Chinese celestial (equatorial) coordinates consisted of right ascension and (north) polar distance, expressed in d\u00f9, the angular distance covered by the Sun\u2019s projected daily motion. To define right ascension, the hour circles passing through the principal stars of the 28\ntraditional astrological \u2018lunar mansions\u2019 (lodges)\u2014segments of the ecliptic traversed by the projected lunar orbit\u2014were used.\nFigure 3. Original diagram of S\u016b S\u00f2ng\u2019s (1020\u20131101) astronomical clock tower, featuring (top) an armillary sphere powered by a waterwheel according to Zh\u0101ng H\u00e9ng\u2019s design. (Wikimedia Commons; public domain.)\nZh\u0101ng also developed the idea of lunar eclipses as geographic aids and invented quantitative cartography, allowing him to apply longitude and latitude grids to maps. He was appointed as an Imperial official by Emperor \u0100n of H\u00e0n (\u6f22\u5b89\u5e1d; reigned 106\u2013125 CE). He was subsequently promoted to Director of the Imperial Bureau of Astronomy and Calendrics, a role to which he was reappointed by Emperor \u0100n\u2019s successor (not including the very shortlived reign of Emperor Sh\u01ceo; \u5c11\u5e1d), Emperor Sh\u00f9n of H\u00e0n (\u6f22\u9806\u5e1d; reigned 126\u2013144 CE). Zh\u0101ng\u2019s maps have been lost, although his D\u00ecx\u00edng t\u00fa topographical map is recorded (Zh\u0101ng, 847 CE) as having been used until at least the T\u00e1ng dynasty (618\u2013690 and 705\u2013907; see Yee, 1994). However, we can obtain some interesting insights from descriptions in Zh\u0101ng\u2019s biography by the scholar C\u00e0i Y\u014dng (\u8521\u9095; 132\u2013192 CE), who stated that Zh\u0101ng H\u00e9ng \u201c\u2026 cast a network about heaven and earth and reckoned on the basis of it.\u201d (Temple, 1989: 30). Zh\u0101ng\u2019s pioneering work, collected in his treatise Discourse on New Calculations (ca. 116 CE), greatly influenced that of his W\u00e8i (220\u2013265 CE) and J\u00ecn dynasty (265\u2013420 CE) successor, the cartographer P\u00e9i Xi\u00f9 whom we encountered already. P\u00e9i was the first scholar to include a mathematical grid reference and a graduated scale on his maps for improved accuracy in distance estimates (Needham, 1989: 538\u2013540; Hsu, 1993). He adopted the grid as one of his \u2018six principles of scientific cartography\u2019\u2014comprising scale, bearing, distance, square/oblique, high/low, curved/straight\u2014and \u2018division by l\u01d0\u2019 (a l\u01d0 is a little shorter than 600 m, although it is often equated to 500 m). These principles had been developed in more rudimentary fashion by his predecessors, such that \u2026\nWhen the principle of the rectangular grid is properly applied, then the straight and the curved, the near and the far, can conceal nothing of their form from us. (Harvey, 1980: 133\u2013134).\nHowever, Yee (1994) argues that P\u00e9i\u2019s square grid pattern was practically different\nfrom the pattern included on later Chinese maps, including the famous S\u00f2ng dynasty stone-\nengraved grid map from 1137, the Map of the Tracks of Y\u01d4: see Figure 4. This latter map is covered by 5110 squares, with each grid cell representing approximately 100 l\u01d0 on a side, resulting in an overall scale of approximately 1:5,000,000 (e.g., Zhang, 2015: Chapter 2). The Map of the Tracks of Y\u01d4 represents the country\u2019s river systems, lakes and coastlines at unprecedented precision for the times. Yee (1994) suggests that P\u00e9i\u2019s map instead used a single reference point, which would facilitate and regulate \u2018backsighting\u2019 as a means of checking one\u2019s bearings:\nIn any case, the introduction of a grid pattern and establishing the relative positions of places of interest on land is not the same as determining one\u2019s longitude on the open seas. In fact, ancient Chinese maps\u2014including he Map of the Tracks of Y\u01d4\u2014may have featured square grid patterns, but the grid was not meant to operate in the same sense as the mathematical graticule pattern on modern (Western) maps. Instead, Chinese grids appear to have been superimposed on maps almost arbitrarily. Grids were primarily meant to help map readers determine distances, directions and land areas (for a detailed discussion on the origin of the grid pattern, see Yee, 1994)."

            "heading": "4 LUNAR ECLIPSE OBSERVATIONS",
            "text": "Ancient Chinese cartographers were well versed in determining their positions accurately on land, using triangulation and observations of the night sky, but longitude determination at sea required further developments. By the T\u00e1ng dynasty, Chinese astronomers had mastered the skills to determine their latitude, while the world\u2019s earliest meridian measurement was also achieved around this time (e.g., Zhu, 2001).\nLongitude determinations using lunar eclipses were most likely introduced to China by Arab astronomers during the Mongol Empire and the Yu\u00e1n dynasty (e.g., van Dalen, 2002; Zhang, 2002). However, systematic observations of lunar eclipses and attempts at predicting them had started already early in the third century CE. Eclipse timings were usually obtained with the aid of clepsydras (water clocks). Chinese techniques spread across East Asia, particularly to Japan and the Korean peninsula. High-quality eclipse records from across East Asia became common after about the year 1000, reaching a highest accuracy on the order of one-quarter of an hour by the end of the thirteenth century (Song, 1370).\nDuring his 1220\u20131221 campaigns in Tashkent and Samarkand (in present-day\nUzbekistan), the Mongol ruler Ghengis Khan (1162\u20131227; reigned 1206\u20131227) requested that his Khitan consultant, the high official \u2018Longbeard\u2019 Y\u00e9l\u01dc Ch\u01d4c\u00e1i (\u8036\u5f8b\u695a\u6750; 1190\u20131244), an expert in astronomy and astrology, engage with local Muslim astronomers so as to obtain predictions of two lunar eclipses. Y\u00e9l\u01dc\u2019s own eclipse timing predictions turned out to be more accurate than those of his local colleagues (Yabuuti and van Dalen, 1997; Shi, 2014).\nNevertheless, these latter scholars taught him the concept of time differences between different geographic longitudes. Y\u00e9l\u01dc incorporated this idea into his own work, the G\u0113ngw\u01d4 Epoch System of Calendrical Astronomy for the Western Expedition, which is recorded6 in the History of Yu\u00e1n (Song, 1370). This Western Expedition Calendar with Epoch Year G\u0113ngw\u01d4 (that is, 1210) is almost identical to the D\u00e0m\u00edng l\u00ec, the Great Enlightenment Calendar of the J\u00ecn dynasty (Yabuuti and van Dalen, 1997), except for a correction for the use of Samarkand as geographic reference. Y\u00e9l\u01dc explained in his section on the lunar position,\nMaking X\u00fan s\u012b g\u0101nch\u00e9ng [Samarkand] the standard, we put the distance in l\u01d0s on the counting board and multiply it by 4359. Moving the [decimal] position backwards, we divide by 10,000 and make f\u0113ns [one ten-thousandth]. These are called the l\u01d0 difference. (Yabuuti and van Dalen, 1997: 12).\nHere, the l\u01d0 difference is the geographic correction at Samarkand with respect to a reference location in mainland China. Yu\u00e1n dynasty Chinese astronomers were skilled in using lunar eclipses to determine their local longitude, although this was a rather cumbersome process (e.g., de Grijs, 2017: Chapter 2). It required synchronous time measurements across large distances. The lunar eclipse method applied by Chinese astronomers required a base observatory in China. For a given lunar eclipse, observers at both the base observatory and the location of interest identified bright stars that passed through the local meridian at the moment the Moon started to reappear after the eclipse. Upon the astronomers\u2019 return to the base observatory, both records were compared and a second measurement was obtained to determine the exact time difference of the meridian passages of both stars. The measured time difference corresponded directly to the difference in longitude between both locations. Chinese astronomers had long known about the Moon\u2019s irregular motion, the \u2018inequality of lunation\u2019. The orbital irregularities had first been discovered by the astronomer Ji\u01ce Ku\u00ed (\u8cc8\u9035; 30\u2013101 CE) during the Eastern H\u00e0n era (e.g., Sun, 2000). The Moon\u2019s apparent motion takes it 360 degrees around the Earth to its original position among the background stars in approximately 27.3 solar days. This motion corresponds to an average of 13 degrees per day, or slightly more than half a degree per hour. While the \u2018fixed\u2019 stars appear to move westwards because of the Earth\u2019s rotation, the Moon appears to describe a retrograde orbit with respect to the fixed stars, covering approximately half a degree per hour in the eastward direction. The Moon appears to speed up when going towards the Sun and it seems to slow down when retreating. The change in orbital motion also depends on the Earth\u2019s orbital position. Having noticed the irregular nature of the lunar motion, Chinese astronomers used a variety of interpolation methods to predict the Moon\u2019s \u2018equation of time\u2019, leading to accurate predictions of the Moon\u2019s motion across the sky through the \u2018equal interval second difference method\u2019\u2014also known as the piecewise parabolic interpolation\u2014proposed by Li\u00fa Zh\u016bo7 (\u5218\u712f; 544\u2013610 CE) (Qu, 2000). This method was further improved upon during the Yu\u00e1n dynasty, by Gu\u014dsh\u01d2uj\u00ecng (\u90ed\u5b88\u656c ; 1231\u20131316; see Section 5), using third-degree interpolation\u2014 although for the solar motion, whose equation of time had been determined by the astronomer Zh\u0101ng Z\u01d0x\u00ecn (\u5f35\u5b50\u4fe1; ca. 560 CE) during the Su\u00ed dynasty (581\u2013618 CE; Qu, 2000). By simply measuring the angular distance on the sky between the Moon when it crosses the local meridian and a given star, one can calculate the local longitude. This requires only access to a sextant (or, in China, a \u2018star board\u2019; see Section 7), without the need for an accurate clock. This thus implies that Chinese astronomers would have been able to\naccurately calculate lunar positions on the sky since the Yu\u00e1n dynasty. In turn, this would have allowed them to compile ephemeris tables listing the positions on the sky of the Moon and a set of reference stars throughout the year. Armed with such tables and with access to a star board, they could have been able to determine their longitude at sea fairly accurately (cf. de Grijs, 2017: Chapter 2; Jin, 1996; see also Section 7). This method is, in fact, equivalent to the \u2018lunar distance method\u2019 employed by European astronomers several centuries later (e.g., de Grijs, 2020). However, one might wonder how effective the use of eclipses would have been in the general context of longitude determination, given that these are rare events. During any calendar year, up to seven eclipses may occur, either four solar and three lunar or five solar and two lunar eclipses. Since lunar eclipses can be seen from the entire half of the Earth facing the Moon while solar eclipses are only visible from a narrow geographic path, at any given location on Earth one can see more lunar than solar eclipses during any time period. Still, their frequency is clearly insufficient to efficiently generate large-scale longitude catalogues. 5 GU\u014c SH\u01d1UJ\u00ccNG We learn from the Book of Astronomy (1383) in the History of Yu\u00e1n that the Arab astronomer (\u201c\u2026 from the western regions \u2026\u201d; Zhu, 2001: 360) and the founder of the Islamic Astronomical Bureau, Jamal al-Din Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u1e6c\u0101hir ibn Mu\u1e25ammad al-Zayd\u012b al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b (ca. 1255\u20131291; van Dalen, 2007), introduced the Theory of Earth Being Round to the Mongol Emperor and his court.\nIn 1267, al-Din al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b\u2014better known by his Chinese name Z\u0101m\u01cer\u01d4d(d)\u012bn or Zh\u0101m\u01cel\u01d4d\u012bng (\u5284\u99ac\u9b6f\u4e01)\u2014also built the first wooden terrestrial globe covered by a longitude and latitude grid and featuring a correct sea:land ratio of 70:30. He offered his globe to Gu\u014d Sh\u01d2uj\u00ecng, the Chinese astronomer, engineer and mathematician whom the Jesuit astronomer Johann Adam Schall von Bell (1591\u20131666) called the \u2018Tycho Brahe of China\u2019. Nevertheless, it appears that these foreign influences did not have a significant effect on traditional Chinese cartography (Zhu, 2001).\nFigure 5.

It consists of three graduated ring systems, from which the equatorial, ecliptic and horizontal coordinates of celestial bodies could be measured.

(Wikimedia Commons; public domain.)\nAs usual at the start of a new dynasty, in 1276 the first Yu\u00e1n Emperor, Kublai Khan (1215\u20131294), assigned the compilation of a new and improved calendar to his court astronomers. Gu\u014d Sh\u01d2uj\u00ecng was tasked with calendar reform, ultimately aiming to unite the\nEmperor\u2019s northern and southern territories. Among Gu\u014d\u2019s first notable achievements was the realisation that the armillary sphere at the Imperial Observatory in N\u00e1nj\u012bng, the Yu\u00e1n capital, had been constructed for a geographic latitude of 35\u00b0N, the latitude of the Northern S\u00f2ng capital, K\u0101if\u0113ng.\nHe proceeded to construct a dozen new instruments for the observatory, including a number of portable instruments for fieldwork and a new torquetum (turquet) which featured the positions of the main celestial bodies (the Sun, the Moon, the ecliptic, Polaris and other bright stars) for reference and which could be employed to determine longitudes based on the progressive daily difference between sidereal and either solar or lunar time.8 Figure 5 shows (left) a M\u00edng-era armillary sphere at N\u00e1nj\u012bng Observatory and (right) an example of a medieval torquetum.\nFigure 6. Excerpt from Gu\u014d Sh\u01d2uj\u00ecng\u2019s Sh\u00f2ush\u00ed calendar. (Courtesy: baike.com; public domain.)\nGu\u014d had access to accurate water clocks. By 1276, Chinese engineers had developed compensating mechanisms for reduced water flow\u2014and hence water pressure\u2014 as time progressed, for differences in air pressure, and for different water temperatures and salinity levels. Chinese water clocks were calibrated based on the number of drips between subsequent solar meridian passages. Gu\u014d and his colleagues completed the new Yu\u00e1n calendar\u2014Sh\u00f2ush\u00ed(l\u00ec) (\u2018measuring time for the public\u2019: see Figure 6)\u2014in 1280. They adopted the winter solstice of that year as the calendar\u2019s reference epoch.\nGu\u014d and his team had conducted numerous complicated calculations (e.g., to correct for variations in the speed of the projected solar motion) as well as astronomical observations across a wide area (latitudes, 15\u201365\u00b0N; longitudes, 102\u2013128\u00b0E) to eventually determine the length of the (tropical) year at 365.2425 days\u2014identical to the length of the year adopted for the Gregorian calendar in 1582\u2014and that of the lunar month at 29.530593 days (Li and Zhang, 1996). The discrepancy between Gu\u014d\u2019s tropical year and the actual period of one rotation of the Earth around its axis was a mere 26 seconds.\nGu\u014d\u2019s Sh\u00f2ush\u00ed calendar contained astronomical data, including for 1461 bright stars, from thousands of observations, which had taken numerous astronomers many years to\ncompile. Based on these data, comets, eclipses and the times of sunrise and sunset, as well as those of moonrise and moonset, could be predicted many years in advance. The Sh\u00f2ush\u00ed calendar also included the projected positions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets relative to the standard set of bright reference stars and to each other. The wealth of data allowed skilled mathematicians and astronomers to calculate the main celestial events for any day and almost any location. Specifically, the data were sufficient to calculate one\u2019s longitude9 based on either the progressive daily difference between sidereal and solar time, lunar eclipses or the lunar distance method, that is, on the basis of the projected angular distances between pre-defined bright stars (or planets) and the lunar limb at a given time. For navigation purposes, Gu\u014d\u2019s calendar established a common framework of longitude and latitude. The positions of all stars in the northern hemisphere could be fixed relative to Polaris, which in turn allowed the production of universal star maps for common use by the country\u2019s navigators. In addition, navigators were provided with extensive star tables, equivalent to what we now refer to as almanacs. Thus, all navigators were taught to sail on the basis of a common system of longitude and latitude, using a uniform set of stars (with agreed-upon names) to base their bearings on."

            "heading": "6 EXPANDING CHINESE INFLUENCE",
            "text": "Circumstantial evidence suggests that Chinese navigators may have mastered some degree of longitude determination already in the fourteenth century. As part of an expedition undertaken from 1334 to 1339, a traveller from Qu\u00e1nzh\u014du\u2014W\u0101ng D\u00e0yu\u0101n (\u6c6a\u5927\u6df5; fl. 1311\u2013 1350)\u2014successfully made a transoceanic voyage from Mozambique to Sri Lanka using a combination of compass and stellar position measurements called Gu\u00f2 y\u00e1ng qi\u0101n x\u012bngsh\u00f9 (\u2018star orientation\u2019) to determine his ship\u2019s latitude and longitude (Wang, 2004a; Morton and Lewis, 2005: 128).\nMeanwhile, the Mongol Emperors were keen to engage with Arab astronomers and visiting navigators alike (e.g., Zhang, 2002). The Yu\u00e1n court ordered officials in Qu\u00e1nzh\u014du, the official starting point of the Maritime Silk Road during the Yu\u00e1n dynasty, to collect Arab compass navigation charts from visiting navigators. Qu\u00e1nzh\u014du was one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world during the S\u00f2ng and Yu\u00e1n dynasties, a city that was temporarily home to many experienced foreign (mostly Arab) navigators who would exchange information and their knowledge of ocean navigation among themselves and with their Chinese hosts.\nWe learn from a hand-written copy of the Notebook on Sea Bottom Currents, found in Qu\u00e1nzh\u014du, that in 1382 the emperor ordered the Islamic observatory official Hay-dar (H\u01cei d\u00e1 er; \u6d77\u7b54\u5152) and Mash\u0101\u2019ikh (M\u01ce sh\u0101 y\u00ec h\u0113i; \u99ac\u6c99\u4ea6\u9ed1), a master of Islam, to collect the best astronomy books from among several hundred volumes of the Books from the Western Regions at the Yu\u00e1n court. In 1383 their selection was published in Chinese as the Works of Astronomy (Astrology). The volume included a discussion of the Islamic concepts of longitude and latitude. The Works of Astronomy was originally composed by the mathematician Abu Hassan Koshiya (971\u20131029), who played an important role in the development of spherical trigonometry. In 1403 Zh\u00e8ng H\u00e9 represented the Y\u01d2ngl\u00e8 Emperor, Zh\u016b D\u00ec (\u6731\u68e3; 1360\u20131424), on a mission to recruit foreign (Arab) navigators for transoceanic voyages and collect information about sea currents, islands, mountains, straits and the positions of stars so as to revise their navigation charts. The Yu\u00e1n Emperor\u2019s focus on enlisting Arab astronomers is obvious from the passage below, which was taken from the Treatise on Calendrical Astronomy from Western Areas by the Imperial official X\u00fa Y\u01d2uzh\u0113n (\u5f90\u6709\u8c9e; 1407\u20131472):\nThe Muslim system of calendrical astronomy is said to have been authored by an extraordinarily talented man named Mahamute [Mohammed] in the Aerbi [Arab] year, in a Western place called Make [Mecca] ... Calendar makers believed it to be the most accurate system for the calculation of the longitudes, latitudes as well as ominous motions [of the Seven Luminaries, that is, the seven moving astronomical objects in the sky visible to the naked eye: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn], but it did not spread eastwards before the Yu\u00e1n era.\nWhen the first Emperor [of the present dynasty] inaugurated the composition of the D\u00e0t\u01d2ng l\u00ec [the \u2018great universal system of calculating astronomy\u2019], he summoned to his court [several] Westerners, experts in calendar making, and ordered the Bureau of Astronomy to adopt the Muslim astronomical techniques as a supplement [to the D\u00e0t\u01d2ng l\u00ec]. It has remained in use since then. My friend Li\u00fa Zh\u00f2ngf\u00fa [\u5289\u4ef2\u5b5a; viz. Li\u00fa X\u00ecn \u5289\u4fe1] has excellent knowledge of stars and astronomical tables. He has comprehensively studied all sorts of [Chinese astronomical] methods and is also proficient in Western [Islamic] ones. He noted that the Muslim system of calendrical astronomy is somewhat inconsistent and devoid of uniform rules, and would therefore become more and more confusing with the passage of time. Consequently, he translated the Muslim text precisely, prescribed rules for its usage and pre-calculated the essential quick tables. The resulting procedures are brief, simple and clear. They form an orderly book devoted to the [Muslim] school of astronomy that is to be used indefinitely and to remain essential to students of calendrical astronomy.

            "text": "Other transoceanic voyages undertaken in the early fifteenth century may not have had the need to rely on their navigators\u2019 skills to determine longitude at sea. For instance, the fourth expedition (1413\u20131415: see Figure 7, left) of the eunuch Admiral and Chief Envoy Zh\u00e8ng H\u00e9 set off from Sumatra, in present-day Indonesia, sailing 10 days in full wind to reach the Maldives archipelago. From there, they sailed across the Indian Ocean in full wind for 15 days, reaching Mogadishu in East Africa, some 3700 miles from their port of origin (Wang, 2004a; Morton and Lewis, 2005: 128, translation):\nThis voyage appears to have followed well-established Arab and Chinese trade routes rather than breaking new navigational ground. Dreyer (2007: 35\u201336) clearly explains the navigational premise of Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s voyages (my emphasis):\nAll of the voyages were within waters dominated by the seasonal pattern of monsoon winds. From December to March, high pressure over Central Asia produces cold, dry winds that blow from the north and the northeast ... This weather pattern reverses itself in April, when winds laden with vapor arise in the subequatorial waters of the Indian Ocean. Blowing northward in a generally circular pattern, they approach India and Southeast Asia from the south or southwest ... Predictable monsoon winds also aided navigation. With latitude calculated fairly easily from stellar observations, predictable monsoon winds gave navigators the confidence to sail straight from the southern Arabian peninsula to the west coast of India, or from Ceylon and\nsouthern India to Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, following a particular latitude line. Well before the rise of Islam, Arabs from the southern part of the peninsula had discovered this secret, and they were joined on the ocean by Tamils from southern India and Indonesians from Sumatra and other islands.\nIn his discussion of Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s seventh voyage (19 January 1431\u201322 July 1433), Dreyer\n(2007: 161) explicitly refers to the practice of \u2018running down the latitude\u2019, which was also adopted by early European seafarers (e.g., de Grijs, 2017: 2-47), including Columbus and Vespucci (my emphasis):\nThe fleet spent three full days at Zhan City and then set sail on 17 June [1433], the first day of the sixth lunar month. The Xi\u00e0 X\u012by\u00e1ng10 [Down to the Western Ocean] records several sightings on the next leg of the voyage, incidentally providing confirmation that the navigators of Zh\u00e8ng H\u00e9's fleet were happy to sail by landmarks when they could find them, rather than by dead reckoning [sailing by knowing one\u2019s latitude and compass course while accounting for the effects of the wind and currents].\nNevertheless, Zh\u00e8ng routinely travelled to Qu\u00e1nzh\u014du, as well as to the southern\nChinese provinces of F\u00faji\u00e0n, Gu\u01cengd\u014dng and Zh\u00e8ji\u0101ng, prior to each of his voyages in search of talented foreign navigators residing in China, who would be rewarded handsomely upon their return from successful missions. It is conceivable that Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s navigators may have used sightings of the rising or setting Sun and Moon to help determine how far the ship had sailed in an easterly or westerly direction (which is equivalent to determining longitude based on an approach similar to the lunar distance method), while they used stellar elevations to determine both their longitudes and latitudes (Gong, 2005).\nOn 10 October 1432, Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s fleet set sail once again, this time from Pulau Rondo on Sumatra to Sri Lanka. The fleet continued to Kuli (Calicut) in India, where they arrived on 10 December 1432. Their next leg commenced three days later and involved a 35-day voyage, until 16 January 1433, to Bandar-e Abbas in the Strait of Hormuz. They soon proceeded with their next transoceanic leg, crossing the Arabian Sea from Dingde Baxi (present-day Dandi Bandar) to Jabal Khamis in present-day Oman.\nThe expedition used the declination of Zh\u012bn\u01da (the \u2018weaving girl,\u2019 corresponding to the star Vega) and of N\u00e1nm\u00e9n shu\u0101ngx\u012bng (two stars in the constellation of Sagittarius) for geographic location determination. Travelling westwards, they relied on observations of Pollux and Procyon to determine their longitudes and latitudes (Liu, 1989; Wang, 2004b: 395\u2013 397; Liu et al., 2005). Specifically, Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s navigators based their transoceanic voyages on 10 stars, which enabled them to determine their approximate longitudes and latitudes at sea. For latitude determination and navigation, they relied on stars close(st) to the North and South Poles, respectively Polaris and the Southern Cross combined with Canopus, in turn cross-referenced to Polaris (for details, see Liu, 1989; Liu et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2007), as well as on stars in Sagittarius. For longitude determination, their guide stars included Pollux in the northwest, Procyon in the southwest and Vega and bright stars in Taurus in the East (Wang, 2004b: 396).\nDing et al. (2007) pointed out that Zh\u00e8ng and his navigators used star boards rather than sextants (see also Jin, 1996), although both types of tools serve the same purpose. Zh\u00e8ng had access to 12 different star boards, whose use would depend on the altitudes of the stars of interest (e.g., Jin, 1996):\nThe size of the largest board [was] around 24 cm \u00d7 24 cm (12 fingers \u2026, using the size of [the] human thumb) and the smallest, 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm (1 finger), with [successive differences of] 2 cm [each] (Zhao, 2005). Using the attached thread, around 60 cm in length, the observer was able to fix the distance from the eye to the board, thus fix the angle of observation of the board, about 1.9\u00b0 per finger. When observing celestial bodies, the observer aligned the star [with] the [top] of the board and the horizon [with] the [bottom], and thus the height of the star was determined. (Ding et al., 2007: Section 3.2).\nThe resulting positional uncertainty was as small as 4.5 nautical miles (Zhao, 2005;\nalthough it is unclear to which latitude range this uncertainty applies), an unprecedented accuracy for the times. Since the D\u00e0t\u01d2ng l\u00ec\u2014which was based on Gu\u014d Sh\u01d2uj\u00ecng\u2019s pioneering\nsystem of calendrical astronomy\u2014had been formally adopted by the M\u00edng Bureau of Astronomy in 1384, it is conceivable that Zh\u00e8ng and his navigators were familiar with longitude determination at sea on the basis of solar and lunar eclipses as well."

            "text": "In his capacity of senior administration official, between 1405 and 1433 Zh\u00e8ng led seven expeditions to southeast, South and West Asia, and to East Africa. They were aimed at establishing a Chinese presence, enforce Imperial control over trade in the Indian Ocean and extend the Y\u01d2ngl\u00e8 Emperor\u2019s tributary territories (see Figure 7, right and middle panels). Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s sailing charts are thought to have consisted of four maps, one each centred on Sri Lanka, South India, the Maldives and a fourth map showing some 400 km of the East African coast, covering the coastal waters to a southern latitude of six degrees.\nZh\u00e8ng\u2019s maps contained sailing directions for more than 40 oceanic trade routes (Ding et al., 2007; Sun, 2009). Note that the M\u00e1o K\u016bn Map (Figure 8), which is usually considered a good representation of Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s map, was in fact compiled approximately two centuries after Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s voyages, and so the M\u00e1o K\u016bn Map may not accurately represent the cartography available to the Admiral. Modelled on the Great Chart of the Yangtze River, the M\u00e1o K\u016bn Map was originally a scroll collection that had to be read from right to left. The scroll, the first international chart in existence anywhere in the world, was titled Chart of the course taken by the treasure ship from its start at L\u00f3ngj\u01d0ng to the destinations of foreign lands (Ding et al., 2007). It was subsequently converted into a 24-page book, including two pages containing four navigational star charts, when it became part of the Treatise on Armament Technology (e.g., Sun, 2009).\nZh\u00e8ng\u2019s sailing charts were designed\u2014likely with the help of Arabic-speaking pilots with detailed knowledge of the African coast\u2014for the specific purpose that they would be used to sail along certain routes. As such, their positions vary in orientation to align with the ocean currents and winds, as required of a sailing chart, specifically from the user\u2019s perspective (e.g., Sun, 2009). The aim was clearly to provide positional information in the\nshortest time possible, as also evidenced by the orientation of the geographic features: they are seen from the user\u2019s orientation, and so they do not feature coordinate graticules nor scales, and neither are they oriented according to fixed cardinal directions (e.g., Sun, 2009). The margins of the coastal charts contained a selection of realistic drawings of coastal features\u2014including peaks, islands, rocks, temples, bridges and buildings.11\nSailing instructions were offered using a 24-point compass system with a Chinese symbol for each point, combined with a sailing time or distance. Local currents, winds and depth soundings were taken into account. For instance, off the coast of China\u2019s Zh\u00e8ji\u0101ng and F\u00faji\u00e0n provinces, we read\nShips sail across the Xi\u00e0o Sh\u00f9n Ocean and arrive at Ji\u00fa Sh\u0101n [Sh\u0101n = Mountain], where the depth of the water is 9 tu\u01d2 [one fathom; two outstretched arms equal 1 tu\u01d2 or 1.66 m]. In the south-west on the opposite side from Ji\u00fa Sh\u0101n, there are sunken rocks where great waves break over them ... In the north-west there are sunken rocks where great waves break over them, be careful when sailing ... D\u014dng Lu\u00f2 Sh\u0101n, pass through the channel between the islets ... Xi\u00e1 Mountain, pass outside. (Sun, 2009: 338).\nThis level of detail appears to have been common, given that Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s other navigational chart collections, e.g., for the waters surrounding the Maldives archipelago, G\u01d2ng Zh\u0113n\u2019s (\u978f\u73cd; fl. 1430\u20131434) Accounts of the Western Countries (1434) warns,\n\u2026 apart from the eight main islands where trade could be carried on ... there are 3000-odd places where there are eddies of water. Keep clear of them carefully lest ships be wrecked. (Sun, 2009: 338).\nDespite the absence of a latitude and longitude grid, a physical scale or a north-pointing bearing, \u201c\u2026 the errors [were] usually not more than 5 degrees, which is thought to be wonderful for the helmsmen of 1425.\u201d (Needham, 1971, cited by Sun, 2009: 337).\nThe 24-point compass system resembles the system used for navigation in the western Pacific, which was used by the ancient Polynesian navigators (e.g., de Grijs, 2017: Chapter 2). In a Chinese cultural context, the compass points are based on the 12 directions of the Earthly Branches, a system for timekeeping. For navigation purposes, 12 points were insufficient, thus prompting the introduction of 24- or even 48-point compasses by inserting intermediate directions. Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s fleet navigated on the basis of both so-called \u2018wet\u2019 compasses\u2014composed of a needle floating in water contained in a circular box with the compass points carved on wooden rim\u2014and magnetic compasses (Ding et al., 2007).\nAs early as the Yu\u00e1n and early M\u00edng Dynasties, the Chinese had already invented an approach to timekeeping that was reasonably accurate and worked on land as well as at sea. They were indeed far ahead of European developments, which would not bear fruit until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (e.g., de Grijs, 2017: Chapters 3\u20136). A particularly promising Chinese timing device was the everbright lantern, which operated similarly to the common candle clocks in use at the time. Xi\u00e8 Ji\u00e9 (\u8b1d\u6770), a contemporary M\u00edng author, elaborated on what was known as the compass navigation method of the Zh\u0101ngzh\u014du people:\nThe compass cabin burns everbright lanterns day and night, five g\u00e8ng each night and five g\u00e8ng each day. So a ship sailing for 12 Chinese hours [24 hours] burns the equivalent of a total of 10 g\u00e8ng. (Han, 2002: 248; translation: Wang, 2011: 2).\nThe accuracy of this timekeeper was remarkable for the times. Over the course of 24\nhours, or 10 g\u00e8ng, a lantern would consume one catty of oil (Han, 2002: 248\u2013249), equivalent to approximately 500\u2013600 grams, so that its burn rate could be determined to better than 0.1 catty by reading off the amount of oil consumed on a graduated glass reservoir. Chinese navigators could thus keep track of the local time in their homeport while out at sea. Comparing the ship\u2019s local times of sunrise or sunset with the homeport\u2019s time based on the lantern, they could obtain a rough estimate of their longitude difference.\nIncense coils with known, carefully calibrated combustion timescales had been used for the same purpose since the sixth century and became commonplace in the S\u00f2ng dynasty (Richards, 1998: 52). Both timing devices were used for periods of up to weeks or even\nmonths. To obtain a more accurate measurement of the time (and longitude) difference with respect to the homeport, water clocks were employed to time the difference between a homeport\u2019s benchmark time (e.g., the time of sunrise) and that at the ship\u2019s location. This was done most accurately by weighing the amount of water consumed between both calibration moments (Han, 2002: 248\u2013249).\nAfter the death of the Y\u01d2ngl\u00e8 Emperor in 1424, Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s expeditions were discontinued and a period of decline in cartographic developments commenced. China began to look inwards, adopting a policy of isolationism that lasted a few hundred years. The new H\u00f3ngx\u012b Emperor (1378\u20131425) ordered that Zh\u00e8ng\u2019s fleet be burnt, along with all records, thus ending the \u2018Age of the Sea.\u2019 In addition, the H\u00f3ngx\u012b Emperor expressly prohibited overseas travel. Anyone who disobeyed the order was killed."

Therefore, in 1708 he sponsored a geodesy and mapping programme using astronomical observations and triangulation measurements (Hostetler, 2013).

In the context of the longitude story, Ricci\u2019s most important contributions to Chinese developments include his unwavering efforts to produce accurate world maps, his mappa mundi. Following the first edition of his Complete Map of the Earth\u2019s Mountains and Seas,12 published in 1584, Ricci produced a total of eight editions of this map between 1584 and 1608.\nFigure 9. Composite of Matteo Ricci\u2019s Map of the Myriad Countries of the World (1602). (Courtesy: Library of Congress, Geography and Map Division, digital IDs g3200.ex000006Za, b.)\nThe map\u2019s third edition, the Complete Map of the Myriad Countries on Earth (see Figure 9), was produced in 1602 either by or with the help of the powerful M\u00edng official L\u01d0 Zh\u012bz\u01ceo (\u674e\u4e4b\u85fb; 1565\u20131630), who had been Ricci\u2019s student since 1601 (e.g., Elman, 2007; Hart, 2013: 253). Ricci\u2019s maps combined quantitative cartography by means of a carefully drawn longitude and latitude grid with a prominent narrative component. In the map\u2019s righthand margin, Ricci introduced the prevailing Catholic interpretation of the cosmos as well as extant European geographical knowledge of astronomy, cartography, world geography and\nAristotelian scholastic natural philosophy (e.g., Zhang, 2015). In addition to these descriptions, which included overviews of the five continents, the world\u2019s oceans and the different climate zones, Ricci also explained the causes of solar and lunar eclipses, the relative sizes of the Earth, the Sun, the planets and the fixed stars as well as their respective distances, and the translucency and solidity of the crystalline celestial spheres. Ricci\u2019s description of the Earth as a globe, a \u2018terrestrial sphere\u2019, located at the centre of the cosmos prompted a revision of Chinese ideas of the world at large. He introduced the concepts of the Equator, the North and South Poles, and the identification of locations by means of their latitudes and longitudes. He even attempted to provide an estimate of the size of the Earth. From personal observation, he initially suggested that one degree of latitude corresponded to 200 l\u01d0; in turn, that measure of length implied that the Earth\u2019s circumference was 72,000 l\u01d0 or about 36,000 km (Zhang, 2015: note 45). Around 1600, Ricci revised his estimate to 250 l\u01d0 per degree latitude, or a circumference of 90,000 l\u01d0 (45,000 km). In 1702, in the late K\u0101ngx\u012b reign, M\u00edng literati reversed the estimate once again, to 200 l\u01d0 for one degree of latitude.13 Based on our present knowledge of the Earth\u2019s size, its circumference is 40,075.017 km (80,150.034 l\u01d0), corresponding to 222.63 l\u01d0 per degree latitude.\nMost important from a practical perspective, Ricci and his successors introduced Western knowledge of mapping to Chinese scholars, including surveying and methods using degrees of latitude and longitude. Nevertheless, despite Ricci\u2019s introduction of mathematical geography and his influence at the M\u00edng court, the traditional Chinese grid system continued to dominate Chinese cartography throughout the late M\u00edng and Q\u012bng periods (Elman, 2007). However, some aspects of Ricci\u2019s teachings gradually found their way into local map-making. For instance, the scholar C\u00e1o J\u016bny\u00ec (\u66f9\u541b\u7fa9) produced a \u2018Complete Map\u2019 in 1644 that mixed Chinese classical approaches to map-making with reasonably accurate locations of Europe, Africa, India and Central Asia based on the use of longitudes to determine the relevant distances from N\u00e1nj\u012bng (see Smith, 1998: 71\u201383). However, as late as in 1832, L\u01d0 Zh\u00e0olu\u00f2\u2019s ( \u674e\u5146\u6d1b ; 1769\u20131841) atlas of the Q\u012bng Empire showed both grid and latitude and longitude lines on the same map (Elman, 2007), thus highlighting the reluctance of home-grown cartographers to fully relinquish the traditional system."

            "heading": "8.2 Seventeenth-century developments",
            "text": "Later Jesuit missionaries to China built on Ricci\u2019s early work. Specifically, they reinforced the classical idea of a rotating, spherical Earth, which in turn implied that longitude differences were equivalent to time differences. The Jesuits\u2019 main focus was on contributing to astronomical measurements of solar and lunar eclipses, the ephemerides of Jupiter's satellites, comets and transits of Mercury across the solar disk. Those observations were all employed to determine accurate longitudes and latitudes across China and to obtain firm constraints on the shape of the Earth. Among the Chinese scholars in the Jesuits\u2019 orbit, the scholar and Imperial official Xi\u00f3ng M\u00edngy\u00f9 (\u718a\u660e\u9047; 1579\u20131649) was the most senior member. He befriended a number of Jesuit missionaries around 1613\u20131615, including Sabbathin (Sabatino) de Ursis (1575\u20131620). Xi\u00f3ng offered support to the notion that the Earth was spherical in his preface to de Ursis\u2019 treatise Explanation of the Gnomon (1614)\u2014as well as in his own Manuscript on the Investigation [of the Principle of Things] to Attain [Knowledge] (1648)\u2014mostly because he was convinced that the Europeans had offered the requisite proof by having circumnavigated the globe (Zhang, 2015: Chapter 4). In a section of the latter treatise titled There Are No Vacuums or Obstacles on the Round Earth, Xi\u00f3ng explained,\nIn fact, navigators can sail around the Earth as if making a circle \u2026 using longitudes running North to South and latitudes [such as the] Equator. They measure the position of the Sun during the day and of the stars at night and are able to determine the high or low [of their location] and the distance they have travelled. Thus the Earth can be navigated. (Xi\u00f3ng, 1648: 151b\u2013152a; translation: Zhang, 2015: 54).\nThus far, Chinese navigators had only been able to determine their latitude at sea (and not their longitude), given the absence of a cultural notion allowing for the Earth\u2019s sphericity. Xi\u00f3ng\u2019s new insights represent the first steps by a Chinese scholar to embrace that latter\nconcept. The increasing availability of accurate lunar eclipse timing predictions 14 and of ephemeris tables allowing the calculation of immersions and emersions of Jupiter\u2019s Galilean satellites, such as those published in 1683 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625\u20121712), Director of the Paris Observatory, greatly enhanced the Jesuits\u2019 productivity. Observations of the immersions and emersions of Jupiter\u2019s satellites were the preferred approach (Go\u00fcye, 1688: 232) to determining longitudes given their frequent occurrences. However, owing to the prevailing timing uncertainties of about 2 minutes in Cassini\u2019s ephemeris tables, the inherent uncertainties in contemporary longitude determinations were at least half a degree. Gisl\u00e9n (2017) analysed the quality of Chinese ephemeris observations obtained in 1689\u20131690 and the longitudes thus derived. He concluded that the observations were of high and consistent quality, and that the resulting longitudes of Hoai-ngan (Hu\u00e1i\u2019\u0101n), Si-ngan-fu (X\u012b\u2019\u0101n), Canton (Gu\u01cengzh\u014du), Chang-hai (Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei), Nankin (N\u00e1nj\u012bng) and Peking (B\u011bij\u012bng) were in good agreement with modern values. However, one should keep in mind that the Jesuits had obtained their carefully calibrated geographic location measurements on solid ground; doing the same on board pitching and rolling ships was a different matter altogether. The most important astronomical and geographical contributions were made\u2014both en route to China and in residence\u2014by Jean de Fontaney (1643\u20121710), Antoine Thomas (1644\u2013 1709), Guy Tachard (1651\u20121712), Fran\u00e7ois No\u00ebl (1651\u20131729), Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gerbillo (1654\u20121707), Louis Le Comte (1655\u20121728), Joachim Bouvet (1656\u20121730), Claude de Visdelou (1656\u20121737), Ignaz K\u00f6gler (1680\u20131746), Jean-Baptiste Jacques (1688\u20131728), Andr\u00e9 Perreira (1689\u20131743), Antoine Gaubil (1689\u20131759) and August von Hallerstein (1703\u2013 1774) (e.g., Udias, 1994, 2003; Uhalley and Wu, 2015: 142; Gisl\u00e9n, 2017)."

            "text": "In 1708, the 47th year of his reign, the K\u0101ngx\u012b Emperor commissioned a nationwide geodetic survey. He also commissioned the production of a comprehensive map of his empire, which would be based on longitudes and latitudes rather than on P\u00e9i Xi\u00f9\u2019s \u2018six principles of cartography\u2019, as had been advised by the classicist scholar H\u00fa W\u00e8i (\u80e1\u6e2d; 1633\u20131714):\nAlas! Since the collapse of the J\u00ecn dynasty cartography has become an extinguished learning. How pitiable! I wish there were someone willing to take up the mission to restore ancient learning and memorialise the throne to obtain a decree making all local magistrates survey the roads in their jurisdictions by land and water, take note of the high and low, the precise spatial alignment, and the curving and straight, and submit all these data to the highest official in charge of revenue. This official then would hire mathematicians throughout the country to calculate the correct horizontal distances between these places and, noting their correct positions relative to each other, would then put all the data into a book. \u2026The maps made on the basis of such data would show all the places correctly; there would be no attaining accuracy in one corner and losing it in another. [If that happens,] then P\u00e9i Xi\u00f9\u2019s extinguished learning would be revived again. Wouldn\u2019t that be an achievement worthy of celebration for ten thousand generations? (H\u00fa, 1701: 123\u2013124; translation: Zhang, 2015: 249).\nThe K\u0101ngx\u012b Emperor\u2019s ultimate aim was to unify the entire country and strengthen the border regions against foreign aggressors by producing a comprehensive, accurate and detailed national map. He ordered the Jesuits to collect local maps, purchase instruments and recommend specialists to engage with. Meanwhile, he established a national geographic survey and mapping framework. Over the course of the next ten years, survey teams experienced considerable hardships while climbing mountains and crossing streams to survey the major locations of interest in each province; they engaged local officials and also referred to local historical documents. Latitudes and longitudes were determined based on astronomical surveys, adopting the longitude of the Q\u012bng capital, B\u011bij\u012bng, as the prime meridian. K\u0101ngx\u012b\u2019s Jesuit Atlas was eventually completed in 1718. The central map, the Map of a Complete View of the Imperial Territory, drawn at a scale of 1:1,400,000 and using the socalled \u2018trapezoid\u2019 projection, was\n\u2026 very detailed, including strategic junctures and forts, dikes, coastal defences, village fortifications and garrisons, postal stations and ferry towns, strategic defiles, environment, defenses and transportation, no matter how remote and desolate. (Veritable Records of the K\u0101ngx\u012b Reign, chapter 283; translation: Y. Chen, 1996: 321).\nThe renowned sinologist Joseph Needham (1985: 235) has praised the map as\n\u201c\u2026not only the best of all the maps which had ever been made in Asia but better and more accurate than any European map of its time.\u201d Based on the K\u0101ngx\u012b Jesuit Atlas, combined with ancient Chinese records, the French astronomer Alexandre-Gui Pingr\u00e9 (1711\u20131796) calculated B\u011bij\u012bng\u2019s longitude and latitude; his results, published in 1764, became the standard geographic reference. However, the excellence of the K\u0101ngx\u012b Jesuit Atlas was lost on the majority of scholars. The Q\u012bng government considered the map a treasured state secret and consequently restricted access, keeping it hidden in the Imperial Palace. Outsiders were not provided with any details, and even reference materials in Chinese were scarce (Y. Chen, 1996). Although Chinese achievements in surveying and mapping had reached the highest and most advanced level for the times, Chinese cartography did not continue on this promising, upward trajectory.\nWith the withdrawal of Imperial support and a renewed period of inward focus, no new cartographers were trained in the field\u2019s state of the art and progress ceased. In addition, production of planimetric maps like the Golden Mirror of Channelling Water, which were produced around the same time as the K\u0101ngx\u012b Jesuit Atlas, to some extent using similar principles as the Jesuits\u2019 maps (e.g., Yee, 1994), was no longer supported. In fact, the modern cartographic methods introduced by the Jesuits therefore only had a limited impact on Chinese cartography, and so most of Chinese society continued to believe that the Earth was flat (Desnoyers, 2004; Zhu, 2001). It took until the late Q\u012bng era, during the Gu\u0101ngx\u00f9 period (1871\u20131908), before cartographic developments received renewed impetus and general societal attitudes started to change (Zhu, 2001). Maps were finally drawn based on longitude and latitude surveys, using modern map projections."

            "text": "Contrary to the dominant sea-faring nations in western Europe, historical cartographic developments in China were less focussed on finding one\u2019s position at sea than on accurate representation of local areas. While European nations pursued oceanic exploration driven by powerful, persistent economic motivations, such conditions were almost entirely absent in China. Until the arrival of the first Jesuit missionaries in the late sixteenth century, the Chinese worldview was narrow and the notion of the Earth as a sphere had not yet found common ground. With the exception of Zh\u00e8ng H\u00e9\u2019s fabled voyages aimed at securing loyalty from and submission of foreign leaders, the Chinese did not undertake any major exploratory expeditions. Nevertheless, Zh\u00e8ng H\u00e9\u2019s expeditions demonstrated that M\u00edng-era China did have a powerful capacity for ocean navigation. To some extent influenced by innovations introduced by Arab navigators (e.g., Zhang, 2002), the Chinese developed their own independent means of longitude determination, based on both astronomical observations and cleverly designed timekeeping devices. Zh\u00e8ng H\u00e9\u2019s maps, while different in orientation and design from their European counterparts, reflect the high level of navigational expertise and maritime technology already achieved and available at the time. Chinese maps were not uniformly \u2018Westernised\u2019 until at least the end of the nineteenth century. However, from the Bureau of Institutional Studies (Yee, 1994) we learn that combining maps from different provincial governments into a large-scale national atlas was complicated by the wide diversity of map-making methods in use, despite the official adoption of nationwide cartographic standards:\nWhen [new maps] were compared with old accounts, there were still discrepancies and similarities. These were all checked by measuring distances and by widely searching through\nrecords in an effort to resolve ambiguities and reach a single conclusion. (Q\u012bnd\u00ecng d\u00e0 q\u012bng hu\u00ec di\u01cen, 1899: 2, 1022; translation: Yee, 1994: 126).\nText-based verification and narrative descriptions thus remain integral components of Chinese cartography, even today."

            "text": "1 References to \u2018China\u2019 and \u2018Chinese\u2019 are used as shorthand to identify the general area encompassed by the modern People\u2019s Republic of China. However, I do not intend to strictly apply present-day national borders to my narrative. 2 Where Chinese names are used, I have adopted the common convention of ordering these names as \u2018surname, first name\u2019. 3 Figure 1 is a portrait gallery of the main characters driving the developments described in this paper, if and when their images were available in the public domain. I encourage the reader to refer to this compilation figure whenever a new character is introduced in a more than cursory manner. 4 Where the source of a translation has not been included explicitly, the English text was taken from the reference cited. 5 \u2018Zh\u0101ng H\u00e9ng\u2019 was formerly transcribed as \u2018Ch\u0101ng H\u00e9ng\u2019. He is also known as \u2018P\u00edngzh\u00ec\u2019. 6 Yabuuti and van Dalen (1997: footnote 2) point out that in the Calendar Annals of the History of Yu\u00e1n Ghengis Khan\u2019s western expedition is misidentified as the \u201c\u2026 western expedition of \u00d6g\u00f6dei \u2026\u201d, Ghengis\u2019 son and successor. 7 Note that the modern p\u012bny\u012bn (English transliteration) rendition of this Chinese name is Li\u00fa Ch\u0101o. 8 Owing to the combination of the Earth\u2019s rotation and its orbital motion around the Sun, the apparent time of the passage of any given star through the local meridian changes by about 4 minutes from day to day. For each day in the full 1461-day cycle, one could then produce ephemeris tables for stars passing through the prime meridian at a given time. At sea, a navigator can determine the time of the passage of a specific star through the local meridian. Compared with the star\u2019s tabulated time of passage through the prime meridian, a time difference and, hence, a longitude difference follows. 9 Note that the Chinese adopted a system composed of 365\u00bc degrees of longitude versus the 360 degrees in use in Europe. In addition, Chinese latitudes were determined with respect to Polaris, while Europeans used the Equator as their reference. 10 The S\u0101nb\u01ceo t\u00e0iji\u00e0n xi\u00e0 x\u012by\u00e1ng j\u00ec t\u014dngs\u00fa y\u01ceny\u00ec (Romance of the S\u0101nb\u01ceo Eunuch\u2019s Voyage to the Western Ocean; 1597) is a novel in one hundred chapters covering Zh\u00e8ng H\u00e9's seven voyages of 1405\u20131433. It is usually attributed to Lu\u00f3 M\u00e0od\u0113ng (\u7f85\u61cb\u767b; fl. 1596). 11 A similar approach to cartographic orientation was adopted for some early Western nautical chart collections, including those of the famous Dutch cartographer Lucas Janszoon Waghenear (ca. 1534\u20131606)\u2014of Spieghel der zeevaerdt (Mariner\u2019s Mirror; 1584) and Thresoor der zeevaert (Treasure of Navigation; 1592) fame\u2014and his compatriot, the portrait painter Cornelis Anthoniszoon (ca. 1505\u20131553). Their charts \u201c\u2026 were drawn with the general direction of the coast stretching from left to right [i.e., in the opposite orientation compared to that adopted by the Chinese] across the sheet without reference to geographical North.\u201d (Cotter, 1980: 425). 12 The genre of Complete Maps of All under Heaven was initiated by Hu\u00e1ng Z\u014dngx\u012b (\u9ec3\u5b97\u7fb2; 1610\u20131695). 13 The K\u0101ngx\u012b Emperor personally decreed that the ruler produced by the Ministry of Works was to be adopted as the national standard of length. The resulting scale implied that five ch\u01d0 (1 ch\u01d0 = 1/3 m) was equal to one b\u00f9, 360 b\u00f9 = 1 l\u01d0 and one degree of latitude = 200 l\u01d0 (Zhang, 2015: Chapter 4). 14 Around the turn of the eighteenth century, Isaac Newton (1642\u20131726/7) had developed his Theory of the Moon\u2019s Motion (1702). The underlying ideas eventually found their way to China, but although Newton\u2019s Theory was used in Europe to determine longitudes, in China it was only applied to predict lunar eclipse timings (Kollerstrom, 2000)."
