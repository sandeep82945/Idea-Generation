    "abstractText": "We study the magnetic geodesic flows on 2-surfaces having an additional first integral which is independent of the Hamiltonian at a fixed energy level. The following two cases are considered: when there exists a quadratic in momenta integral, and also the case of a rational in momenta integral with a linear numerator and denominator. In both cases certain semi-Hamiltonian systems of PDEs appear. In this paper we construct exact solutions (generally speaking, local ones) to these systems: in the first case via the generalized hodograph method, in the second case via the Legendre transformation and the method of separation of variables.",

The following two cases are considered: when there exists a quadratic in\nmomenta integral, and also the case of a rational in momenta integral with\na linear numerator and denominator.

The first integral of the magnetic geodesic flow (1.1) is a function F (x, p) such that F\u0307 = {F,H}mg \u2261 0. If in addition F,H are functionally independent a.e., then the flow (1.1) is completely integrable.\nThe magnetic geodesic flows on various configurational spaces were studied in many papers (e.g., see [2]\u2014[8]). Let us briefly mention the results related to the 2-torus. There are only 2 known examples of integrability at all energy levels.\nExample 1. Let the Riemannian metric and the magnetic field have the form\nds2 = dx2 + dy2, \u03c9 = Bdx \u2227 dy, B = const 6= 0. Then there exists the first integral F = cos ( p1 B \u2212 y ) .\n1S.

Shubin are supported by the Mathematical Center in Akademgorodok under the agreement No. 075-15-2022-282 with the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation.\n1\n2 Example 2. Let the Riemannian metric and the magnetic field have the form\nds2 = \u039b(y)(dx2 + dy2), \u03c9 = \u2212u\u2032(y)dx \u2227 dy.\nThen there exists the linear in momenta first integral F1 = p1 + u(y).\nIt is shown in [9] that if a magnetic field is non-zero, then the existence of a quadratic integral (with analytic periodic coefficients) of the flow (1.1) on the 2-torus at 2 different energy levels implies the existence of a linear integral at all energy levels. This result was generalized on the case of polynomial integrals of an arbitrary degree in [10], [11].\nIn general, in the presence of a non-zero magnetic field it seems to be more natural to search for the first integrals of the flow (1.1) which are conserved only at a fixed energy level. In case of polynomial integrals, as shown in [12], this problem reduces to the search for solutions to certain quasi-linear systems of PDEs, which turn out to be semi-Hamiltonian. It means that the generalized hodograph method ([13]) can be applied to these systems. Notice that the implementation of this method is usually associated with significant difficulties. In application to the problem of geodesic flows, as far as we know, the only example when one managed to construct explicit solutions via this method (they relate to an integral of the fourth degree) is presented in [14].\nLet us also mention the series of papers [15]\u2014[19], where many examples of polynomial integrals of the third and the fourth degrees of various mechanical systems were constructed.\nOn the other hand, non-polynomial integrals (e.g., rational ones) of the magnetic geodesic flow (1.1), as far as we know, are almost unexplored so far. At the same time a large number of papers are devoted to study rational integrals of mechanical systems at large (including the standard geodesic flows without magnetic fields), e.g., see [20]\u2014[35].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly present the known results on linear integrals of geodesic flows and magnetic geodesic ones. In Section 3 we recall how the generalized hodograph method works. In Section 4 we use this method to construct the solutions which correspond to quadratic integrals of the magnetic flow (1.1) at a fixed energy level. In Section 5 we study the rational integrals of the magnetic flow (1.1) with a linear numerator and denominator and reduce the problem of constructing such integrals to the search for solutions to a certain PDE of the second order. Finally, in Section 6 we construct exact solutions to this equation.\n2. Linear integrals\nThe problem of local polynomial integrals of the first and the second degrees of 2- dimensional geodesic flows was actually solved by G.D. Birkhoff in [36]. Further his results were generalized. For instance, local integrals of higher degrees were studied in [37], [38]. A classification of linear and quadratic integrals of geodesic flows on the 2-sphere and the 2-torus was obtained in [39].\n3 In case of linear integrals, all these results can be easily generalized to the case of magnetic geodesic flows. Let us briefly recall this construction (in slightly different terms compared with [36]).\nChoose the conformal coordinates ds2 = \u039b(x, y)(dx2 + dy2) on a 2-surface, then the\nHamiltonian takes the form H = p2 1 +p2 2\n2\u039b(x,y) . Suppose that the magnetic geodesic flow (1.1)\nadmits a linear integral F = a(x, y)p1+b(x, y)p2+c(x, y) at a fixed energy level {H = C1} or, equivalently (e.g., see [33]), at all energy levels. The condition {F,H}mg \u2261 0 implies:\nax = by, ay = \u2212bx, (a\u039b)x + (b\u039b)y = 0, (2.1)\ncx = b\u2126, cy = \u2212a\u2126. (2.2) Thus the system splits into two subsystems (2.1), (2.2). The first one relates to the standard geodesic flow, and the second one describes the magnetic field. Notice that the cross-differentiation (2.2) gives (a\u2126)x + (b\u2126)y = 0, which implies (due to (2.1)) that \u039b(x, y) and \u2126(x, y) are functionally dependent.\nLet us consider separately the subsystem (2.1). As shown in [36] one can introduce local coordinates u(x, y), v(x, y) such that the metric takes the form ds2 = \u039b(x, y)(dx2+dy2) = \u03bb(v)(du2 + dv2). Therefore, the coordinate u is cyclic and the additional integral (in the absence of a magnetic field) has the form F1 = pu.\nThese observations allow to construct solutions to the system (2.1), (2.2). Going to coordinates u(x, y), v(x, y) we obtain that the linear integral of the geodesic flow (1.1) of the metric ds2 = \u03bb(v)(du2 + dv2) in the magnetic field \u03c9 = \u2126(u, v)du \u2227 dv has the form F = pu + f(u, v) for a certain function f(u, v). The condition {F,H}mg \u2261 0 implies immediately that f(u, v) = f\u0303(v) and \u2126(u, v) = \u2212f\u0303 \u2032(v) (compare with Example 2 in the Introduction). So, if the magnetic geodesic flow admits a linear integral, then up to a change of coordinates the metric and the magnetic field have the forms described above.\n3. The generalized hodograph method\nBefore studying the quadratic integrals of the magnetic geodesic flows, let us briefly recall how the generalized hodograph method works ([13]). The quasi-linear system (written in Riemann invariants)\nrit = vi(r)r i x, i = 1, ..., n, vi 6= vj (3.1)\nis called semi-Hamiltonian if the following relations hold true\n\u2202i ( \u2202jvk vj \u2212 vk ) = \u2202j ( \u2202ivk vi \u2212 vk ) , i 6= j, j 6= k.\nAny semi-Hamiltonian system admits infinitely many symmetries (commuting flows) of the form rit = wi(r)r i x, i = 1, ..., n, where wi and vi satisfy the relations\n\u2202kvi vk \u2212 vi = \u2202kwi wk \u2212 wi , i 6= k.\n4 For any commuting flow a solution to the following system of algebraic equations\nwi(r) = vi(r)t+ x, i = 1, ..., n,\nis also a solution to the initial semi-Hamiltonian system (3.1). For semi-Hamiltonian systems which are not in the diagonal form\nuit = n\u2211\nj=1\nvij(u)u j x, i = 1, ..., n, (3.2)\none can search for commuting flows in the form\nui\u03c4 = n\u2211\nj=1\nwij(u)u j x, i = 1, ..., n\ntaking into account the following condition\n\u2202\u03c4 (u i t) = \u2202\u03c4\n( n\u2211\nj=1\nvij(u)u j x ) = \u2202t(u i \u03c4 ) = \u2202t ( n\u2211\nj=1\nwij(u)u j x\n) . (3.3)\nIn this case one can construct a solution to the semi-Hamiltonian system (3.2) by solving the following system of algebraic equations\nx\u03b4ik + tv i k = w i k. (3.4)\n4. Quadratic integrals\nSuppose that the magnetic geodesic flow (1.1) admits a quadratic in momenta integral at a fixed energy level which is independent of the Hamiltonian. Choose the conformal coordinates ds2 = \u039b(x, y)(dx2 + dy2) on a surface, then the Hamiltonian takes the form H = p2 1 +p2 2\n2\u039b(x,y) . Let us fix the energy level {H = 1 2 } and search for a quadratic integral F at\nthis level in the following form:\nF = 2\u2211\nk=\u22122 ak(x, y)e\nik\u03c6,\nwhere ak(x, y) = uk(x, y)+ ivk(x, y), a\u2212k = ak. Following [12], we assume that a2 = a\u22122 = \u039b. Also denote f = u1\u221a\n\u039b , g = v1\u221a \u039b . Then, as shown in [12], an existence of the integral F is\nequivalent to an existence of solutions to the following semi-Hamiltonian system\nA(U)Ux +B(U)Uy = 0, (4.1)\nwhere\nA =   0 0 1 0 f 0 \u039b 0 2 1 0 g\n2\n0 0 0 \u2212f 2\n  , B =   0 0 0 1 \u2212g 0 0 \u2212\u039b 0 0 \u2212g\n2 0\n2 \u22121 f 2\n0\n  ,\n5 here U = (\u039b, u0, f, g) T . The magnetic field has the form: \u2126 = 1 4 (gx \u2212 fy) . In this Section we construct solutions to the system (4.1) (generally speaking, local ones) via the generalized hodograph method. Notice that this system also admits global analytic solutions on the 2-torus (see [40], [41]).\nTo apply the generalized hodograph method to the system (4.1), we construct its symmetries of the form\nU\u03c4 = A1(U)Ux +B1(U)Uy,\nwhere A1, B1 are certain unknown matrices. Having constructed the symmetries and having solved the corresponding algebraic system (3.4), we find the solutions to the initial system (4.1). We shall search for the components of the unknown matrices A1, B1 in the form of non-homogeneous polynomials of a degree N in the unknown functions \u039b, u0, f, g. By direct calculations (very bulky ones though) one may check that for N = 1 the generalized hodograph method yields only trivial (i.e. constant) solutions, and for N = 2 we obtain the solutions which relate to the Liouville metric and a zero magnetic field.\nFor N = 3 we shall search for the components of the matrices A1 = (aij)1\u2264i,j\u22644 and B1 = (bij)1\u2264i,j\u22644 in the following form:\naij = cij1f 3 + cij2f 2g + cij3f 2\u039b + cij4f 2u0 + cij5f 2 + cij6fg 2 + cij7fg\u039b + cij8fgu0 + cij9fg+ cij10f\u039b 2+ cij12f\u039b+ cij11f\u039bu0+ cij13fu 2 0+ cij14fu0+ cij15f + cij17g 2\u039b+ cij18g 2u0+ cij16g 3 + cij19g 2 + cij20g\u039b 2 + cij22g\u039b + cij21g\u039bu0 + cij23gu 2 0 + cij24gu0 + cij25g + cij26\u039b\n3 + cij28\u039b 2 + cij31\u039b + cij27\u039b 2u0 + cij29\u039bu 2 0 + cij30\u039bu0 + cij32u 3 0 + cij33u 2 0 + cij34u0 + cij35,\nbij = dij1f 3 + dij2f 2g + dij3f 2\u039b + dij4f 2u0 + dij5f 2 + dij6fg 2 + dij7fg\u039b + dij8fgu0 + dij9fg + dij10f\u039b 2 + dij12f\u039b + dij11f\u039bu0 + dij13fu 2 0 + dij14fu0 + dij15f + dij17g\n2\u039b + dij18g 2u0+ dij16g 3+ dij19g 2+ dij20g\u039b 2+ dij22g\u039b+ dij21g\u039bu0+ dij23gu 2 0+ dij24gu0+ dij25g+ dij26\u039b 3+dij28\u039b 2+dij31\u039b+dij27\u039b 2u0+dij29\u039bu 2 0+dij30\u039bu0+dij32u 3 0+dij33u 2 0+dij34u0+dij35,\nwhere cijkl, cijh, dijkl, dijh are certain constants, h = 1, ..., 9, k = 1, ..., 3, l = 1, ..., 5. One can find these constants taking into account the relations (3.3). The final form of the matrices A1, B1 is very bulky so we shall not write these matrices out explicitly. Introduce the new notations:\n\u03b1 = 4c141 + d115, \u03b2 = c1119 \u2212 2c1219, \u03b3 = \u22128c1415 \u2212 2d1135, \u03b4 = 4c1235 \u2212 2c1135, \u01eb = c1125 \u2212 2c1225, \u03b6 = c1122 \u2212 2c1222.\nThe relations (3.4) are equivalent to the following system of 11 algebraic equations on the unknown functions \u039b(x, y), u0(x, y), f(x, y), g(x, y) (notice that due to [13] this system is compatible):\n\u2212 4\u03b1f 3 + f 2(6\u03b6\u039b\u2212 4\u03b2g + \u03b6u0 \u2212 4\u01eb) + 2f ( \u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b1 ( g2 + 4(6\u039b + u0) ) + 2y ) \u2212 4\u03b2g3\n+ g2(\u22122\u03b6\u039b+ \u03b6u0 \u2212 4\u01eb) + 2g(\u03b4 + 8\u03b2(u0 \u2212 2\u039b) + 2x) + 4\u039b(\u03b6(\u039b + u0)\u2212 4\u01eb) = 0,\n6 \u03b6f 2 \u2212 32\u03b1f + \u03b6g2 + 2\u03b6(\u039b + u0)\u2212 8\u01eb = 0, 2\u03b3 \u2212 4\u03b1f 2 + f(4\u03b6\u039b+ \u03b6u0 \u2212 4\u01eb)\u2212 4\u03b1 ( g2 + 8\u039b + 4u0 ) + 4y = 0,\n\u03b6u0 \u2212 4(2\u03b1f + 2\u03b2g + \u01eb) = 0,\n\u2212 48\u03b1f 3 + \u03b6f 4 + f 2 ( 2\u03b6 ( g2 + 11\u039b + 3u0 ) \u2212 24\u01eb ) + 8f ( \u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b1 ( g2 + 4(4\u039b + u0) ) + 2y )\n+ 32\u03b2g3 + \u03b6g4 + g2(6\u03b6\u039b\u2212 2\u03b6u0 + 8\u01eb) + 8\u039b(\u03b6(\u039b + u0)\u2212 4\u01eb) = 0,\n\u221240\u03b1f 2 + \u03b6f 3 + f ( \u03b6 ( g2 + 10\u039b + 4u0 ) \u2212 16\u01eb ) + 4 ( \u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b1 ( g2 + 8\u039b + 4u0 ) + 2y ) = 0,\n\u03b6f 2 \u2212 16\u03b1f + 2\u03b6\u039b+ \u03b6g2 + 16\u03b2g = 0, \u03b4 2 + \u039b (\u03b6f 2 \u2212 32\u03b1f + 2\u03b6(\u039b + u0)\u2212 8\u01eb) g \u2212 \u03b2 ( f 2 + 8\u039b\u2212 4u0 ) + 2\u03b1fg + \u03b2g2 + x = 0,\n\u03b3 2 + \u03b1f 2 + f(\u03b6\u039b+ 2\u03b2g)\u2212 \u03b1\n( g2 + 8\u039b + 4u0 ) + y = 0,\n4\u03b1f + 4\u03b2g \u2212 \u03b6u0 2 + 2\u01eb = 0,\n\u22128\u03b2\u039b + \u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b2f 2 + 2\u03b1fg + \u03b2g2 \u2212 \u03b6g\u039b+ 4\u03b2u0 + x = 0.\nIt is easy to check that in case \u03b6 = 0 this system admits only trivial solutions, therefore further we shall assume that \u03b6 6= 0. Simplifying these equations, we finally obtain\n\u039b = \u2212\u03b6f 2 \u2212 \u03b6g2 + 16\u03b1f \u2212 16\u03b2g\n2\u03b6 , u0 =\n4(2\u03b1f + 2\u03b2g + \u01eb)\n\u03b6 , (4.2)\nwherein f(x, y), g(x, y) satisfy the following two relations:\n\u2212\u03b62fg2\u221212\u03b2\u03b6fg\u2212\u03b62f 3+26\u03b1\u03b6f 2\u2212192\u03b12f+6\u03b1\u03b6g2+64\u03b1\u03b2g\u221232\u03b1\u01eb+\u03b3\u03b6+2\u03b6y = 0, (4.3)\n\u03b62f 2g\u221212\u03b1\u03b6fg+ \u03b62g3+26\u03b2\u03b6g2+192\u03b22g+6\u03b2\u03b6f 2\u221264\u03b1\u03b2f +32\u03b2\u01eb+ \u03b4\u03b6+2\u03b6x = 0. (4.4) The following theorem holds true.\nTheorem 1. In a small neighborhood of certain points (x0, y0) the system (4.3), (4.4) admits smooth solutions f(x, y), g(x, y). Moreover, by choosing appropriate constants \u03b1, \u03b2 one can obtain the solutions which correspond to a positive conformal factor of the metric \u039b(x, y) (see (4.2)) of a non-zero curvature and a non-zero magnetic field (at least in a small neighborhood of these points).\nThe functions f(x, y), g(x, y), \u039b(x, y), u0(x, y) constructed in such a way satisfy the initial semi-Hamiltonian system (4.1).\nProof. Consider the mapping S : R2 \u00d7 R2 \u2192 R2, S = S(f, g, x, y), which is given by relations (4.3), (4.4). The proof of Theorem 1 is based on applying the implicit function theorem to the mapping S. We skip the details.\n7 Notice that in the particular case \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0 the system (4.2) \u2014 (4.4) has the following exact solutions:\n\u039b(x, y) = \u2212 1 2\u03b6 3\n\u221a \u03b6(2x+ \u03b4)2 + \u03b6(2y + \u03b3)2, u0(x, y) = 4\u01eb\n\u03b6 ,\nf(x, y) = 2y + \u03b3\n3 \u221a \u03b6(2y + \u03b3)2 + \u03b6(2x+ \u03b4)2\n, g(x, y) = \u2212 2x+ \u03b4 3\n\u221a \u03b6(2y + \u03b3)2 + \u03b6(2x+ \u03b4)2 ,\nwhere \u03b3, \u03b4, \u01eb, \u03b6 are arbitrary constants, wherein \u03b6 6= 0. In this case the metric is flat, and the magnetic field has the form\n\u2126(x, y) = \u2212 2 3 3 \u221a \u03b6(2x+ \u03b4)2 + \u03b6(2y + \u03b3)2 .\nTo construct the exact solutions to the initial problem in general case, let us make the change of variables (x, y) \u2192 (f, g) = (X, Y ). The corresponding formulas are given by the relations (4.3), (4.4). For simplicity assume that \u03b3 = \u03b4 = \u01eb = 0, \u03b6 = 2. Extending this transformation to a canonical one, we obtain the following relations between the new momenta P1 = Pf , P2 = Pg and the old ones p1, p2 :\nP1 = \u22122p1(XY \u2212 3Y \u03b1+ 3X\u03b2 \u2212 8\u03b1\u03b2) + p2((3X \u2212 8\u03b1)(X \u2212 6\u03b1) + Y (Y + 6\u03b2)), P2 = \u2212X2p1 \u2212 (3Y + 8\u03b2)(Y p1 + 2p2\u03b1 + 6p1\u03b2) + 2X(Y p2 + 3p1\u03b1 + 3p2\u03b2).\nThis allows to construct the following local integrable example.\nExample 3. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 be arbitrary constants.

Rational integrals\nThe remaining part of the paper is devoted to the rational integrals. Suppose that the magnetic geodesic flow (1.1) admits a rational integral with a linear numerator and denominator at a fixed energy level. Choose the conformal coordinates ds2 = \u039b(x, y)(dx2+ dy2) on a surface and fix the energy level H = p2 1 +p2 2\n2\u039b(x,y) = C 2 .We shall search for the rational\nintegral in the form\nF = a0(x, y)p1 + a1(x, y)p2 + f(x, y)\nb0(x, y)p1 + b1(x, y)p2 + g(x, y) . (5.1)\nLet us parameterize the momenta in the following way: p1 = \u221a C\u039bcos\u03c6, p2 = \u221a C\u039b sin\u03c6. The condition dF dt = 0 is equivalent to the following relation (see [12], [10]):\nFx cos\u03c6+ Fy sin\u03c6+ F\u03c6 ( \u039by 2\u039b cos \u03c6\u2212 \u039bx 2\u039b sin\u03c6\u2212 \u2126\u221a C\u039b ) = 0. (5.2)\nSubstituting (5.1) into (5.2), one obtains that the left-hand side is a polynomial in ei\u03c6, all the coefficients must vanish.\nVanishing of the coefficient at e3i\u03c6 is equivalent to the following relation (e.g., see [33]): ( a0 \u2212 ia1 b0 \u2212 ib1 )\nx\n\u2212 i ( a0 \u2212 ia1 b0 \u2212 ib1 )\ny\n= 0.\nIntroducing the notations\nu = a0b0 + a1b1 b20 + b 2 1 , v = a0b1 \u2212 a1b0 b20 + b 2 1 ,\nwe may rewrite the previous equality in the following form (u+ iv)x \u2212 i (u+ iv)y = 0. Consequently, u(x, y), v(x, y) are two conjugate harmonic functions: ux = \u2212vy, uy = vx. We shall consider the simplest case when\nu(x, y) \u2261 c1, v(x, y) \u2261 c2, where c1, c2 are constants, wherein one may assume that c2 6= 0 (otherwise there exists a linear in momenta integral). Consequently,\na0(x, y) = c1b0(x, y) + c2b1(x, y), a1(x, y) = \u2212c2b0(x, y) + c1b1(x, y).\n9 Vanishing of the coefficient at e2i\u03c6 implies ( f \u2212 (c1 + ic2)g\nb0 \u2212 ib1\n)\nx\n\u2212 i ( f \u2212 (c1 + ic2)g\nb0 \u2212 ib1\n)\ny\n= 0.\nSimilarly we obtain\nf(x, y) = (c2\u03b31 \u2212 c1\u03b32)b0(x, y) + (c1\u03b31 + c2\u03b32)b1(x, y)\nc2 , g(x, y) = \u2212\u03b32b0(x, y) + \u03b31b1(x, y) c2 ,\nwhere \u03b31, \u03b32 are conjugate harmonic functions. Again we shall consider only the simplest case when \u03b31, \u03b32 are arbitrary constants.\nSubstituting the expressions for a0, a1, f , g into F we obtain\nF = c1 + c2 c2(b1(x, y)p1 \u2212 b0(x, y)p2) + \u03b31b0(x, y) + \u03b32b1(x, y) c2(b0(x, y)p1 + b1(x, y)p2)\u2212 \u03b32b0(x, y) + \u03b31b1(x, y) .\nConsequently, one can further assume that the first integral has the form\nF = c2(b1(x, y)p1 \u2212 b0(x, y)p2) + \u03b31b0(x, y) + \u03b32b1(x, y) c2(b0(x, y)p1 + b1(x, y)p2)\u2212 \u03b32b0(x, y) + \u03b31b1(x, y) .\nLet us make an appropriate rotation of the plane x, y and divide the numerator and denominator by c2. After that one can assume without loss of generality that c2 = 1, \u03b31 = \u03b3, \u03b32 = 0, where \u03b3 is a constant.\nSince the coefficients of the integral (5.1) are defined non-uniquely, one can assume without loss of generality that b0(x, y) 2 + b1(x, y) 2 \u2261 1, that is\nb0(x, y) = sin \u03c8(x, y)\n2 , b1(x, y) = cos\n\u03c8(x, y)\n2\nfor a certain function \u03c8(x, y). Then the remaining three equations (which are equivalent to vanishing of the coefficients at eik\u03c6, k = 0, 1) take the form:\n2\u03b3\u2126 sin\u03c8 \u2212 C\u039by + (\u03b32 \u2212 C\u039b)\u03c8x = 0, (5.3) 2\u03b3\u2126cos\u03c8 + C\u039bx + (\u03b3\n2 \u2212 C\u039b)\u03c8y = 0, (5.4) 2\u2126\u039b\u2212 \u03b3\u039by sin\u03c8 + \u03b3\u039bx cos\u03c8 = 0. (5.5)\nMultiply (5.3) by (\u03b3 sin\u03c8), (5.4) by (\u03b3 cos\u03c8), (5.5) by (\u2212C), and sum it up. We obtain 2\u2126 + \u03b3\u03c8x sin\u03c8 + \u03b3\u03c8y cos\u03c8 = 0.\nWe can express the magnetic field:\n\u2126(x, y) = \u03b3\n2 ((cos\u03c8)x \u2212 (sin\u03c8)y).\nMultiply (5.3) by (\u03b3 cos\u03c8), (5.4) by (\u03b3 sin\u03c8), and subtract one form another. We obtain: ( (C\u039b\u2212 \u03b32) sin\u03c8\n) x + ( (C\u039b\u2212 \u03b32) cos\u03c8 ) y = 0. (5.6)\nDue to the expression for the magnetic field the relation (5.5) is equivalent to\n(\u039b cos\u03c8)x \u2212 (\u039b sin\u03c8)y = 0. (5.7)\n10\nIntroduce the notation \u03c1(x, y) = C \u03b32 \u039b(x, y) \u2212 1. Then due to (5.6), (5.7) the functions \u03c1(x, y), \u03c8(x, y) satisfy the relations\n(\u03c1 sin\u03c8)x + (\u03c1 cos\u03c8)y = 0, ((\u03c1+ 1) sin\u03c8)y \u2212 ((\u03c1+ 1) cos\u03c8)x = 0. (5.8) The system (5.8) is semi-Hamiltonian. In the hyperbolic domain (i.e. where \u03c1(\u03c1+1) < 0) it admits the Riemann invariants r1(x, y), r2(x, y) :\n\u03c8 = 1\n2 (r1 + r2) , \u03c1 = \u2212 sin2\n( 1\n4 (r1 \u2212 r2)\n) ,\nand can be diagonalized:\n\u2202r1 \u2202y\n= \u2212 tan ( 1\n4 (3r1 + r2) ) \u2202r1 \u2202x , \u2202r2 \u2202y = \u2212 tan ( 1 4 (r1 + 3r2) ) \u2202r2 \u2202x .\nThis system has an interesting property. It has the form (rj)y + \u03bbj(rj)x = 0, j = 1, 2 and one can easily check that \u2202\u03bbj \u2202rj > 0 everywhere. Due to this fact, apparently, this system does not admit smooth global non-constant solutions. For details we refer the reader to [42] where this observation was used to prove rigorously a non-existence of smooth global solutions for another system.\nThe obtained semi-Hamiltonian system also has infinitely many commuting flows (see [13]) of the form\n\u2202r1 \u2202t = w1(r1, r2) \u2202r1 \u2202x , \u2202r2 \u2202t = w2(r1, r2) \u2202r2 \u2202x ,\nwhere w1(r1, r2), w2(r1, r2) are arbitrary functions satisfying the following relations: ( tan ( 3r1 + r2\n4\n) \u2212 tan ( r1 + 3r2\n4\n)) \u2202w2 \u2202r1 + w2 \u2212 w1\n4 cos2( r1+3r2 4\n) = 0,\n( tan ( 3r1 + r2\n4\n) \u2212 tan ( r1 + 3r2\n4\n)) \u2202w1 \u2202r2 + w2 \u2212 w1\n4 cos2(3r1+r2 4\n) = 0.\nAccording to the generalized hodograph method (see [13]) any two such functions w1, w2 allow to construct a solution to the initial semi-Hamiltonian system (5.8) (see the details in Section 3). Unfortunately, we have failed to construct non-trivial solutions by this method, so we shall follow another way.\nThe first equation in (5.8) means that there exists a function \u03a6(x, y) such that\n\u03a6y = \u03c1 sin\u03c8, \u03a6x = \u2212\u03c1 cos\u03c8. Consequently, sin\u03c8 = \u03a6y\u221a\n\u03a62x+\u03a6 2 y , cos\u03c8 = \u2212 \u03a6x\u221a \u03a62x+\u03a6 2 y , and the function \u03a6(x, y) satisfy the\nequation\n\u25b3\u03a6+ (\n\u03a6x\u221a \u03a62x + \u03a6 2 y\n)\nx\n+ ( \u03a6y\u221a\n\u03a62x + \u03a6 2 y\n)\ny\n= 0\n11\nor, equivalently,\n(\u03a62x + \u03a6 2 y) 3/2\u25b3\u03a6+ \u03a62x\u03a6yy \u2212 2\u03a6x\u03a6y\u03a6xy + \u03a62y\u03a6xx = 0. (5.9) Let us make the Legendre transform (see [43]) of the equation (5.9), namely, assume P = \u03a6x, Q = \u03a6y to be new independent variables and Z = xP + yQ\u2212 \u03a6 to be the new unknown function. We obtain\n((P 2 +Q2)3/2 + P 2)ZPP + 2PQZPQ + ((P 2 +Q2)3/2 +Q2)ZQQ = 0.\nThis transformation allows to obtain solutions such that \u03a6xx\u03a6yy \u2212 \u03a62xy 6= 0. Due to ZPPZQQ\u2212Z2PQ = \u03a6xx\u03a6yy \u2212\u03a62xy we shall search for solutions of the transformed equation such that\nZPPZQQ \u2212 Z2PQ 6= 0. (5.10) Let us make the polar change of variables in the equation. Actually, we already have the equalities P = \u2212\u03c1 cos\u03c8, Q = \u03c1 sin\u03c8, so it will be convenient to use the same notations for new independent variables. Dividing the result by \u03c1, we obtain\n\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1)Z\u03c1\u03c1 + \u03c1Z\u03c1 + Z\u03c8\u03c8 = 0. (5.11)\nIn the new coordinates the condition (5.10) has the form\nZ\u03c1\u03c1Z\u03c8\u03c8 + \u03c1Z\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212 (Z\u03c8\u03c1 \u2212 1\n\u03c1 Z\u03c8)\n2 6= 0.\nSince this condition is imposed on solutions to the equation (5.11), then it is equivalent to the following condition\n\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1)Z2\u03c1\u03c1 + (Z\u03c8\u03c1 \u2212 1\n\u03c1 Z\u03c8)\n2 6= 0. (5.12)\nDue to the inverse Legendre transform ([43]) we have x = ZP , y = ZQ. Due to the inverse function theorem one can find P and Q in terms of x and y if the condition (5.10) holds true. If (5.12) holds true, then one may find \u03c1, \u03c8 in terms of x and y from the relations\nZ\u03c1 = \u2212ZP cos\u03c8 + ZQ sin\u03c8 = \u2212x cos\u03c8 + y sin\u03c8 Z\u03c8 = ZP\u03c1 sin\u03c8 + ZQ\u03c1 cos\u03c8 = x\u03c1 sin\u03c8 + y\u03c1 cos\u03c8.\nBased on these considerations, let us formulate the following\nTheorem 2. Let the function Z(\u03c1, \u03c8) be a solution to the equation (5.11). Assume that the functions \u03c1(x, y), \u03c8(x, y) satisfy the relations\nZ\u03c1(\u03c1, \u03c8) = \u2212x cos\u03c8 + y sin\u03c8, Z\u03c8(\u03c1, \u03c8) = x \u03c1 sin\u03c8 + y \u03c1 cos\u03c8. (5.13) Also assume that for any values \u03c1(x, y), \u03c8(x, y) the condition (5.12) holds true.\nThen the functions \u03c1(x, y), \u03c8(x, y) are solutions to the system (5.8).\n12\nProof. Some details were omitted in the considerations made above. In particular, it was implicitly assumed that \u03c1 > 0. However, the formulated statement can be proved by the direct calculations.\nLet us differentiate (5.13) by x and y. Then it is easy to find the derivatives \u03c1x, \u03c1y, \u03c8x, \u03c8y in terms of the functions \u03c1, \u03c8 from the obtained relations. Namely, the following relations hold true\n\u03c1x = 1\nD (\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c8 sin\u03c8 + Z\u03c8\u03c8 cos\u03c8 + \u03c1Z\u03c1 cos\u03c8 \u2212 Z\u03c8 sin\u03c8),\n\u03c1y = 1\nD (\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c8 cos\u03c8 \u2212 Z\u03c8\u03c8 sin\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c1Z\u03c1 sin\u03c8 \u2212 Z\u03c8 cos\u03c8), (5.14)\n\u03c8x = 1\nD (\u2212\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c1 sin\u03c8 \u2212 Z\u03c1\u03c8 cos\u03c8 +\n1 \u03c1 Z\u03c8 cos\u03c8),\n\u03c8y = 1\nD (\u2212\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c1 cos\u03c8 + Z\u03c1\u03c8 sin\u03c8 \u2212\n1 \u03c1 Z\u03c8 sin\u03c8),\nwhere D = \u03c1(\u03c1 + 1)Z2\u03c1\u03c1 + (Z\u03c8\u03c1 \u2212 1\u03c1Z\u03c8)2. Notice that the condition (5.12) has exactly the form D 6= 0. Substituting the derivatives (5.14) into the system (5.8), we obtain the identities due to the fact that Z satisfies the equation (5.11). Theorem 2 is proved.\nThe first integral can be expressed in terms of \u03c8(x, y) in the following way:\nF = cos \u03c8(x,y) 2 p1 \u2212 sin \u03c8(x,y)2 p2 + \u03b3 sin \u03c8(x,y) 2\nsin \u03c8(x,y) 2 p1 + cos \u03c8(x,y) 2 p2 + \u03b3 cos \u03c8(x,y) 2\n. (5.15)\nTheorem 2 demonstrates that if for some solution to (5.11) one can solve the equation (5.13) for \u03c1, \u03c8, then one can construct an example of a metric and a magnetic field such that the corresponding magnetic geodesic flow admits a rational integral at least at a fixed energy level. As it will be shown in the next Section, it is not difficult to obtain explicit solutions to the equation (5.11). The main obstacle to constructing explicit examples of metrics and magnetic fields is that it is difficult to solve the equations (5.13) for \u03c1, \u03c8 explicitly. However, one can overcome these difficulties by making the change of variables (x, y) \u2192 (\u03c1, \u03c8).\nLet Z(\u03c1, \u03c8) be a solution to the equation (5.11). Let us express x, y in terms of \u03c1, \u03c8 from (5.13)\nx = \u2212Z\u03c1(\u03c1, \u03c8) cos\u03c8 + 1\n\u03c1 Z\u03c8(\u03c1, \u03c8) sin\u03c8, y = Z\u03c1(\u03c1, \u03c8) sin\u03c8 +\n1 \u03c1 Z\u03c8(\u03c1, \u03c8) cos\u03c8. (5.16)\nIf the condition (5.12) holds true at some point \u03c10, \u03c80, then this map has a non-degenerate Jacobi matrix. Then one can make the change of variables in the initial metric, in the magnetic field and in the first integral by choosing \u03c1, \u03c8 as the new independent variables. The corresponding canonical change of momenta has the form\np1 = y\u03c8p\u03c1 \u2212 y\u03c1p\u03c8 x\u03c1y\u03c8 \u2212 x\u03c8y\u03c1 = \u03c1xp\u03c1 + \u03c8xp\u03c8, p2 = \u2212x\u03c8p\u03c1 + x\u03c1p\u03c8 x\u03c1y\u03c8 \u2212 x\u03c8y\u03c1 = \u03c1yp\u03c1 + \u03c8yp\u03c8. (5.17)\n13\nWe shall obtain the explicit formulae in these variables for the metric, the magnetic field and the coefficients of the first integral. The following theorem holds true.\nTheorem 3. Let Z(\u03c1, \u03c8) be a solution to the equation (5.11) in a certain domain A \u2282 {\u22121 < \u03c1 < 0}\u222a{\u03c1 > 0}, and let the condition (5.12) hold true everywhere in this domain. Then in the domain A the geodesic flow of the metric\nds2 = \u03b32(\u03c1+ 1) C\u03c14 ( (\u03c14Z2\u03c1\u03c1 + (\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c8 \u2212 Z\u03c8)2)d\u03c12 \u2212 2\u03c12Z\u03c1\u03c1(\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c8 \u2212 Z\u03c8)d\u03c1d\u03c8\n+ \u03c12(\u03c12(\u03c1+ 1)2Z2\u03c1\u03c1 + (\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c8 \u2212 Z\u03c8)2)d\u03c82 ) (5.18)\nin the magnetic field\n\u03c9 = \u03b3\n2 Z\u03c1\u03c1d\u03c1 \u2227 d\u03c8 (5.19)\nadmits the rational in momenta integral\nF = a0(\u03c1, \u03c8)p\u03c1 + a1(\u03c1, \u03c8)p\u03c8 + \u03b3D sin\n\u03c8 2\nb0(\u03c1, \u03c8)p\u03c1 + b1(\u03c1, \u03c8)p\u03c8 + \u03b3D cos \u03c8 2\n, (5.20)\nwhere\na0(\u03c1, \u03c8) = \u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c8 sin \u03c8\n2 + Z\u03c8\u03c8 cos\n\u03c8 2 + \u03c1Z\u03c1 cos \u03c8 2 \u2212 Z\u03c8 sin \u03c8 2 ,\nb0(\u03c1, \u03c8) = \u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c8 cos \u03c8\n2 \u2212 Z\u03c8\u03c8 sin\n\u03c8 2 \u2212 \u03c1Z\u03c1 sin \u03c8 2 \u2212 Z\u03c8 cos \u03c8 2 ,\na1(\u03c1, \u03c8) = \u2212\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c1 sin \u03c8\n2 \u2212 Z\u03c1\u03c8 cos\n\u03c8 2 + 1 \u03c1 Z\u03c8 cos \u03c8 2 ,\nb1(\u03c1, \u03c8) = \u2212\u03c1Z\u03c1\u03c1 cos \u03c8\n2 + Z\u03c1\u03c8 sin\n\u03c8 2 \u2212 1 \u03c1 Z\u03c8 sin \u03c8 2 ,\nD = \u03c1(\u03c1+ 1)Z2\u03c1\u03c1 + ( Z\u03c8 \u03c1 \u2212 Z\u03c1\u03c8 )2\nat the fixed energy level {H = C 2 }.\nProof. We have to show that the magnetic Poisson bracket\n{F,H}mg = \u2202F\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202H \u2202p\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202F \u2202p\u03c1 \u2202H \u2202\u03c1 + \u2202F \u2202\u03c8 \u2202H \u2202p\u03c8 \u2212 \u2202F \u2202p\u03c8 \u2202H \u2202\u03c8 + \u03b3 2 Z\u03c1\u03c1\n( \u2202F\n\u2202p\u03c1\n\u2202H \u2202p\u03c8 \u2212 \u2202F \u2202p\u03c8 \u2202H \u2202p\u03c1\n) (5.21)\nvanishes for all (\u03c1, \u03c8, p\u03c1, p\u03c8) belonging to the energy level {H = C2 } such that (\u03c1, \u03c8) \u2208 A. Since the condition (5.12) holds true in the domain A, then for any point (\u03c10, \u03c80) \u2208 A the map given by (5.16) is the diffeomorphism of a certain neighborhood of this point to a certain neighborhood of its image, namely the point (x0, y0) (by the inverse function theorem). This diffeomorphism allows to change the coordinates to x, y in this neighborhood; new momenta are defined by the formulae (5.17). This change transforms the metric (5.18), the magnetic field (5.19) and the function (5.20) to the metric \u03b32\nC (\u03c1(x, y) + 1)(dx2 + dy2), the magnetic field \u03b3 2 ( (cos\u03c8(x, y))x \u2212 (sin\u03c8(x, y))y ) dx \u2227 dy\n14\nand the function (5.15) correspondingly. Due to Theorem 2 the functions \u03c1(x, y), \u03c8(x, y) defining the inverse map to (5.16) are solutions to the system (5.8). Consequently, in the coordinates (x, y) the magnetic Poisson bracket vanishes on the set {H = C\n2 }. Since the\ntransform is canonical, the magnetic Poisson bracket (5.21) vanishes at the point (\u03c10, \u03c80). Due to the arbitrariness of this point we obtain that (5.21) vanishes everywhere in the domain A at the energy level {H = C\n2 }. Theorem 3 is proved.\nRemark 1. The condition (5.12) holds true if \u03c1 > 0. So if a solution to (5.11) is defined everywhere for \u03c1 > 0, then one can assume A to be equal to {\u03c1 > 0} in Theorem 3.\n6. Solutions to the key equation and examples\nLet us construct certain partial solutions to the equation (5.11) which yield integrable examples via Theorem 3. We shall use the method of separation of variables, i.e. we shall search for a solution to (5.11) in the form Z(\u03c1, \u03c8) = Z1(\u03c1)Z2(\u03c8). Let us substitute it into the equation and divide it by Z. One can transform the obtained equality in such a way that the left-hand side depends only on \u03c1, and the right-hand side depends only on \u03c8, i.e. both sides are equal to a certain constant \u00b5. Namely, the following relations hold true\n\u2212\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1)Z \u2032\u2032 1\nZ1 \u2212 \u03c1Z\n\u2032 1 Z1 = Z \u2032\u20322 Z2 = \u00b5. (6.1)\nThe general solution to the second equation of (6.1) has the form Z2(\u03c8) = C1e \u221a \u00b5\u03c8 + C2e \u2212\u221a\u00b5\u03c8. The first equation of (6.1) is equivalent to\n\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1)Z \u2032\u20321 + \u03c1Z \u2032 1 + \u00b5Z1 = 0\nFollowing [44], let us write out the general solution to this equation. In case \u00b5 6= \u2212k2, k \u2208 Z we have\nZ1 = C1\u03c1 2F1(1\u2212 i \u221a \u00b5, 1 + i \u221a \u00b5; 2;\u2212\u03c1) + C2 2F1(\u2212i \u221a \u00b5, i \u221a \u00b5; 1; \u03c1+ 1).\nIn case \u00b5 = \u2212k2, k \u2208 Z we have\nZ1 = C1\u03c1 2F1(1\u2212 k, 1 + k; 2;\u2212\u03c1) + C2 1\n\u03c1|k| 2F1\n( |k|+ 1, |k|; 2|k|+ 1;\u22121\n\u03c1\n) .\nIn these equalities 2F1 is the hypergeometric function. Now let us formulate the general statement.\nLemma 1. For any \u03bd \u2208 C the functions \u03c1 2F1(1\u2212 \u03bd, 1 + \u03bd; 2;\u2212\u03c1)ei\u03bd\u03c8, (6.2)\n2F1(\u2212\u03bd, \u03bd; 1; \u03c1+ 1)ei\u03bd\u03c8 (6.3) are solutions to the equation (5.11).\nFor any \u03bd \u2208 Z \\ {0} the function 1\n\u03c1|\u03bd| d|\u03bd|\u22121 d\u03b6 |\u03bd|\u22121\n( 1\n\u03b6 |\u03bd|+1\n\u222b \u03b6\n0\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03be)|\u03bd|\u22121\u03be 1\u2212 \u03be d\u03be )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b6=\u2212 1\n\u03c1\nei\u03bd\u03c8 (6.4)\n15\nis also a solution to (5.11). Any linear combinations of real and imaginary parts of these solutions for different values of \u03bd are also solutions.\nProof. It follows directly from the previous discussions that (6.2), (6.3) are solutions. Let us prove the equality\n1\n\u03c1|\u03bd| 2F1\n( |\u03bd|+ 1, |\u03bd|; 2|\u03bd|+ 1;\u22121\n\u03c1\n) =\n= (2|\u03bd|)! |\u03bd|!(|\u03bd| \u2212 1)!2 1 \u03c1|\u03bd| d|\u03bd|\u22121 d\u03b6 |\u03bd|\u22121\n( 1\n\u03b6 |\u03bd|+1\n\u222b \u03b6\n0\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03be)|\u03bd|\u22121\u03be 1\u2212 \u03be d\u03be )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b6=\u2212 1\n\u03c1\n, (6.5)\nwhich will imply that the function (6.4) is also a solution. We shall use the following well-known equality for hypergeometric functions ([44]):\nd\nd\u03b6 2F1(a, b; c; \u03b6) =\nab\nc 2F1(a+ 1, b+ 1; c+ 1; \u03b6).\nApplying it successively we obtain the equality\n2F1(m+ 1, m; 2m+ 1; \u03b6) = (2m)! m!(m\u2212 1)!(m+ 1)! dm\u22121 d\u03b6m\u22121 2F1(2, 1;m+ 2; \u03b6),\nwhich holds true for any m \u2208 N. Finally, the following sequence of equalities holds true\n2F1(2, 1;m+ 2; \u03b6) = \u221e\u2211\nl=0\n(l + 1)!(m+ 1)!\n(m+ l + 1)! \u03b6 l =\nm(m+ 1)\n\u03b6m+1\n\u221e\u2211\nl=0\n(m\u2212 1)!(l + 1)! (m+ l + 1)! \u03b6m+l+1 =\n= m(m+ 1)\n\u03b6m+1\n\u221e\u2211\nl=0\n\u222b \u03b6\n0\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03be)m\u22121\u03beld\u03be = m(m+ 1) \u03b6m+1\n\u222b \u03b6\n0\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03be)m\u22121\u03be 1\u2212 \u03be d\u03be,\nwhich implies (6.5). Lemma 1 is proved.\nRemark 2. In case \u03bd \u2208 Z\\{0} the first two solutions given in Lemma 1 are proportional to each other. Moreover, in this case they are polynomials due to the fact that the hypergeometric series has only a finite number of non-zero terms. Namely, for any k \u2208 Z \\ {0} the following relation holds true:\n\u03c1 2F1(1\u2212 k, 1 + k; 2;\u2212\u03c1) = \u2212 k\u2211\nj=1\n(k + j \u2212 1)! k(k \u2212 j)!(j \u2212 1)!j!\u03c1 j.\nLet us show an example when the equations (5.13) can be explicitly solved in respect to \u03c1, \u03c8.\nExample 4. Consider a solution to the equation (5.11) which is obtained from Lemma 1 for \u03bd = 0: Z(\u03c1, \u03c8) = ln(1 + \u03c1). The equations (5.13) have the form\n1\n1 + \u03c1 = \u2212x cos\u03c8 + y sin\u03c8, 0 = x sin\u03c8 + y cos\u03c8.\n16\nConsequently \u03c1 = 1\u221a x2+y2 \u2212 1, cos\u03c8 = \u2212x\u221a x2+y2 , sin\u03c8 = y\u221a x2+y2 . We obtain\n\u039b(x, y) = \u03b32\nC \u221a x2 + y2 , \u2126(x, y) = \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u221a x2 + y2 .\nSo the geodesic flow of the metric ds2 = \u039b(x, y)(dx2+dy2) in the magnetic field \u2126(x, y)dx\u2227 dy admits the rational integral\nF = ( \u221a x2 + y2 \u2212 x)p1 \u2212 yp2 + \u03b3y\nyp1 + ( \u221a x2 + y2 \u2212 x)p2 + \u03b3 \u221a x2 + y2 \u2212 \u03b3x .\nHere C > 0, \u03b3 are arbitrary constants. It is easy to check that F is the first integral at all energy levels. Besides, the metric is flat and the change x = C\n4\u03b32 (u2 \u2212 v2), y = C 2\u03b32 uv\ntransforms it to the Euclidean one which implies that there exists a linear integral. To write it out, it is convenient to make the change of variables x = e\u03be cos \u03b7, y = e\u03be sin \u03b7. After this change the metric takes the form ds2 = \u03b3 2\nC e\u03be(d\u03be2 + d\u03b72), and the magnetic field\nbecomes \u2212\u03b3 2 e\u03bed\u03be\u2227d\u03b7. Consequently, due to Example 2 there exists a linear integral which has the form\nF1 = p\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3\n2 e\u03be = \u2212yp1 + xp2 \u2212\n\u03b3\n2\n\u221a x2 + y2.\nOne can check directly that H, F and F1 are functionally independent, i.e. this is the example of a superintegrable magnetic geodesic flow at all energy levels.\nThe constructed example is defined on the set x2 + y2 6= 0. Let us show examples obtained via Theorem 3.\nExample 5. Assume that \u03bd = 2 in Lemma 1. Due to the Remark 2 it is not difficult to find a partial solution to the equation (5.11) of the form Z(\u03c1, \u03c8) = ( 2 3 \u03c1+ \u03c12 ) cos(2\u03c8). We obtain the metric\nds2 = 2\u03b32(\u03c1+ 1)\nC (2d\u03c12 + 2 sin(4\u03c8)d\u03c1d\u03c8 + (1 + 2\u03c1+ 2\u03c12 + (1 + 2\u03c1) cos(4\u03c8))d\u03c82),\nthe magnetic field \u03c9 = \u03b3 cos(2\u03c8)d\u03c1 \u2227 d\u03c8,\nand the rational integral\nF = cos ( \u03c8 2 ) (\u03c1\u2212 2\u03c1 cos\u03c8 \u2212 cos(2\u03c8))p\u03c1 + sin ( 3\u03c8 2 ) p\u03c8 + \u03b3(1 + 2\u03c1+ cos(4\u03c8)) sin ( \u03c8 2 )\n\u2212 sin ( \u03c8 2 ) (\u03c1+ 2\u03c1 cos\u03c8 \u2212 cos(2\u03c8))p\u03c1 \u2212 cos ( 3\u03c8 2 ) p\u03c8 + \u03b3(1 + 2\u03c1+ cos(4\u03c8)) cos ( \u03c8 2 )\nat the energy level {H = C 2 }. Here C > 0, \u03b3 are arbitrary constants; the parametrization of the momenta at this energy level has the form: p\u03c1(\u03c6) = \u22122 \u221a \u03b32(1 + \u03c1) cos(\u03c6\u2212\u03c8), p\u03c8(\u03c6) = \u2212 \u221a \u03b32(1 + \u03c1)(sin(\u03c6+3\u03c8)+(1+2\u03c1) sin(\u03c6\u2212\u03c8)).\nOne can check that this metric is well-defined if \u03c1 > \u22121 and degenerates on the set \u03c1 = \u2212 cos2 2\u03c8. Besides, the metric, the magnetic field and the first integral are 2\u03c0-periodic in respect to \u03c8. Thus this example is well-defined if \u03c1 > \u2212 cos2 2\u03c8, 0 6 \u03c8 < 2\u03c0.\n17\nExample 6. Consider the real part of the solution (6.4) for \u03bd = 1, \u03c1 > 0 :\nZ = ( \u03c1ln ( 1 + 1\n\u03c1\n) \u2212 1 ) cos\u03c8.\nWe obtain the metric\nds2 = \u03b32 2C\u03c14(\u03c1+ 1)3 ( (1 + 2\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1)\u2212 (1 + 2\u03c1) cos(2\u03c8))d\u03c12\u2212\n\u2212 2\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1) sin(2\u03c8)d\u03c1d\u03c8 + 2\u03c12(\u03c1+ 1)2d\u03c82 ) ,\nthe magnetic field\n\u03c9 = \u2212 \u03b3 cos\u03c8 2\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1)2 d\u03c1 \u2227 d\u03c8\nand the rational integral\nF = [ 2\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1) ( p\u03c1\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1) cos ( 3\u03c8\n2\n) + p\u03c8(1 + \u03c1+ (1 + 2\u03c1) cos\u03c8) sin ( \u03c8\n2\n)) +\n+ \u03b3(1 + 2\u03c1\u2212 cos(2\u03c8)) sin ( \u03c8\n2\n)] /\n[ 2\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1) ( \u2212p\u03c1\u03c1(\u03c1+ 1) sin ( 3\u03c8\n2\n) \u2212 p\u03c8(1 + \u03c1\u2212 (1 + 2\u03c1) cos\u03c8) cos ( \u03c8\n2\n)) +\n+ \u03b3(1 + 2\u03c1\u2212 cos(2\u03c8)) cos ( \u03c8\n2\n)]\nat the energy level {H = C 2 }. Here C > 0, \u03b3 are arbitrary constants; the parametrization of the momenta at this energy level has the form:\np\u03c1(\u03c6) = \u03b3(\u2212 cos\u03c6+ (1 + 2\u03c1) cos(\u03c6+ 2\u03c8))\n2\u03c12(1 + \u03c1)3/2 , p\u03c8(\u03c6) =\n\u03b3 sin(\u03c6+ 2\u03c8)\n\u03c1 \u221a 1 + \u03c1 .\nThis metric is well-defined if \u03c1 > 0. It is 2\u03c0-periodic in respect to \u03c8 as well as the magnetic field and the first integral. Besides, it is well-defined in some domains in the strip \u22121 < \u03c1 < 0, bounded by the curve \u03c1 = \u2212 sin2 \u03c8 and straight lines \u03c1 = 0, \u03c1 = \u22121.\nIn addition we note that the curvatures of the metrics constructed in Examples 5, 6 are non-zero in general.\nIn conclusion let us make a couple of general remarks related to other integrable examples which can be obtained from our construction and their possible forms.\nRemark 3. Let k \u2208 N. Then certain solutions to the equation (5.11) can be represented in the form\nZ(\u03c1, \u03c8) = Pk(\u03c1) cos(k(\u03c8 + \u03c80)),\nwhere Pk is a polynomial of degree k (it is uniquely defined by the value of k up to a constant multiplier), besides Pk(0) = 0, and \u03c80 is an arbitrary constant. This solution is obtained from Lemma 1 as a linear combination of real parts of solutions of the form (6.2)\n18\ndue to Remark 2. It is easy to notice that in this example the metric, the magnetic field and the first integral have the coefficients which are polynomial in \u03c1 and trigonometric polynomial in \u03c8.\nRemark 4. Solutions of the form (6.4) (for \u03bd = k) can be represented in the form\nZ(\u03c1, \u03c8) = ( Pk\u22121(\u03c1) + Pk(\u03c1)ln ( 1 + 1\n\u03c1\n)) eik\u03c8, (6.6)\nwhere k \u2208 N, and Pk\u22121, Pk are certain polynomials of degrees k \u2212 1 and k accordingly. Indeed, consider one of the multipliers of (6.4). It follows from the Leibnitz formula that\ndk\u22121\nd\u03b6k\u22121\n( 1\n\u03b6k+1\n\u222b \u03b6\n0\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03be)k\u22121\u03be 1\u2212 \u03be d\u03be\n) = k\u22121\u2211\nj=0\naj,k\u03b6 \u22122k+j\n\u222b \u03b6\n0\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03be)k\u2212j\u22121\u03be 1\u2212 \u03be d\u03be, (6.7)\nwhere aj,k are certain constants. One can check that\n\u222b \u03b6\n0\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03be)k\u2212j\u22121\u03be 1\u2212 \u03be d\u03be = P\u03031,k\u2212j(\u03b6) + P\u03032,k\u2212j\u22121(\u03b6)ln(1\u2212 \u03b6),\nwhere P\u03031,k\u2212j(\u03b6), P\u03032,k\u2212j\u22121(\u03b6) are polynomials of degrees k \u2212 j and k \u2212 j \u2212 1 accordingly, besides P\u03031,k\u2212j(0) = 0. Substituting this expression into (6.7), we obtain\ndk\u22121\nd\u03b6k\u22121\n( 1\n\u03b6k+1\n\u222b \u03b6\n0\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03be)k\u22121\u03be 1\u2212 \u03be d\u03be\n) = \u2212k\u2211\nl=\u22122k+1 bl\u03b6\nl +\n\u2212k\u22121\u2211 l=\u22122k cl\u03b6 l ln(1\u2212 \u03b6).\nHere bl, cl are certain constants. Substituting \u03b6 = \u22121\u03c1 into the obtained relation and multiplying by 1\n\u03c1k , by a certain constant and by eik\u03c8, we obtain (6.6). The real part for\n\u03c1 > 0 has the form\nZ(\u03c1, \u03c8) = ( Pk\u22121(\u03c1) + Pk(\u03c1)ln ( 1 + 1\n\u03c1\n)) cos(k\u03c8).\nThus in the corresponding examples the coefficients of the metric, the magnetic field and the first integral are trigonometric polynomials in \u03c8 and are polynomials in \u03c1 and\nin ln ( 1 + 1\n\u03c1\n) , besides they have at most second degree as polynomials with respect to\nln ( 1 + 1\n\u03c1\n) .\nRemark 5. In other partial cases the solutions given in Lemma 1 are functions which can be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals of the first and the second kind. The following equalities hold true (see [45])\nK(m) = 1\n2 \u03c0 2F1\n( 1\n2 , 1 2 ; 1;m\n) , E(m) = 1\n2 \u03c0 2F1 ( \u22121 2 , 1 2 ; 1;m ) ,\n19\nwhere K, E are complete elliptic integrals of the first and the second kind correspondingly:\nK(m) =\n\u222b \u03c0 2\n0 d\u03b8\u221a 1\u2212m sin2 \u03b8 , E(m) =\n\u222b \u03c0 2\n0\n\u221a 1\u2212m sin2 \u03b8d\u03b8.\nDue to the property of the hypergeometric function (see [44]: formulae (31)\u2014(45) in Section 2.8) for half-integer \u03bd solutions (6.2), (6.3) can be expressed in terms of elementary functions and functions K, E.\nFor instance, assume that \u03bd = 1 2 . Then the real part of the solution (6.2) takes the form\n(for \u03c1 > \u22121)\nZ(\u03c1, \u03c8) = 4\n\u03c0\n( E(\u2212\u03c1)\u2212K(\u2212\u03c1) ) cos \u03c8\n2 The corresponding metric, the magnetic field and the first integral can be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals.\nRemark 6. Solutions to the equation (5.11) of a more general form can be obtained via the Fourier transform of this equation with respect to \u03c8. In particular, in such a way one can obtain solutions which have the form of integrals with respect to \u03bd of solutions (6.2), (6.3) multiplied by certain finite (or decreasing fast enough) functions of \u03bd. Even more general solutions can be obtained if one consider the Fourier transform in the sense of generalized functions (see [46]). We do not formulate any concrete statements here and do not give any solutions obtained via this approach since the corresponding examples of metrics and magnetic fields turn out to be very cumbersome.\n7. Conclusion\nIn this paper we study the magnetic geodesic flow on a 2-surface admitting an additional first integral at a fixed energy level. Depending on the form of the integral the question of its existence reduces to searching for solutions to certain semi-Hamiltonian systems of PDEs.\nIn case of a quadratic in momenta integral we construct exact solutions via the generalized hodograph method. These solutions correspond to the Riemannian metrics of non-zero curvatures and to non-zero magnetic fields. It would be interesting to investigate the possibility of applying this method to construct integrals of higher degrees.\nIn case of a rational in momenta integral with a linear numerator and denominator we manage to reduce the corresponding semi-Hamiltonian system to a linear PDE of the second order. We show that one can construct a rich family of explicit solutions to this equation via the method of separating of the variables. It would be interesting to construct examples of rational integrals with numerators and denominators of higher degrees.\nSumming it up, in this paper we explicitly construct new examples of Riemannian metrics and magnetic fields on 2-surfaces such that the corresponding geodesic flows admit an additional either polynomial or rational in momenta first integral at a fixed energy level.\n20\nAcknowledgments.
