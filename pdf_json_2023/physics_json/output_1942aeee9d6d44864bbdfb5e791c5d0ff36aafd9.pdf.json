    "abstractText": "Mild photothermal therapy (PTT) shows great potential to treat cancers while avoiding unwanted damage to surrounding normal cells. However, the efficacy of mild PTT is normally moderate because of the low hyperthermia temperature and limited light penetration depth. Chemotherapy has unlimited penetration but often suffers from unsatisfactory efficacy in view of the occurrence of drug resistance, suboptimal drug delivery and release profile. As a result, the combinatory of chemotherapy and mild PTT would integrate their advantages and overcome the shortcomings. Herein, we synthesized an NIR-activatable and mild-temperature-sensitive nanoplatform (BDPII-gel@TSL) composed of temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSL), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor (geldanamycin) and photothermal agent (BDPII), for dual chemotherapy and mild PTT in cancer cells. BDPII, constructed with donor-acceptor moieties, acts as an excellent near-infrared (NIR) photothermal agent (PTA) with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (80.75%). BDPII-containing TSLs efficiently produce a mild hyperthermia effect (42 \u25e6C) under laser irradiation (808 nm, 0.5 W cm\u22122). Importantly, the phase transformation of TSL leads to burst release of geldanamycin from BDPII-gel@TSL, and this contributes to down-regulation of the overexpression of HSP90, ensuring efficient inhibition of cancer cell growth. This research provides a dual-sensitive synergistic therapeutic strategy for cancer",

            "text": "Nowadays, treatment of malignant tumors is still a big challenge. This is a major cause of shorter life spans for patients around the world [1\u20133]. So far, chemotherapy is an effective therapeutic strategy to destroy tumor cells [4\u20136]. However, most reported chemotherapeutic agents are incapable of selectively anchoring at the tumor site; thus, they often induce unwanted destruction to normal tissue [7]. Moreover, tumor cells rapidly generate drug resistance after chemotherapy, which also leads to a limitation for this promising therapy [8,9]. Recently, a nano-sized tumor-anchored dual therapy system based on chemotherapeutics has demonstrated an advantage in the precise delivery of drugs to the tumor site and induced satisfactory tumor ablation with negligible drug resistance [7,10]. In particular, the positively triggered drug release system can overcome the shortage of inefficient drug release in a passive drug release system and is thus highly desired [11]. Recent studies have shown that light-controlled therapy with spatiotemporal controllability is a precision strategy with minimized side effects, and the light energy could also be a triggering source to induce drug release in light-stimulus drug delivery systems [12\u201314].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2252. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15092252 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2252 2 of 15\nFor instance, the active and controllable generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in PDT (photodynamic therapy) and hyperthermia in PTT (photothermal therapy) can be triggered by light irradiation and is guaranteed to be highly efficient at the spatiotemporal destruction of tumor cells [13,13\u201323]. The light irradiation for PTT can take advantage of NIR (near-infrared window, \u03bb = 700\u20131100 nm) light, which can achieve much higher penetration than visible light sources [13,24\u201328]. Notably, most PTT is effective in surficial tumors and hardly shows efficacy in tumor cells far away from the light irradiation site owing to the intrinsically limited penetration depth for light in living tissues. Moreover, the NIR light in PTT also could be a stimulus source to positively trigger drug release in chemotherapy. Normally, the NIR-triggered PTT strongly relies on hyperthermia (>50 \u25e6C) to completely eradicate cancer cells, so that the resultant heating diffusion often brings in sideeffects to surrounding normal tissues [20,23,29\u201331]. The emergence of mild PTT (~45 \u25e6C) enables a promising strategy to inhibit cancer cell growth without damage to healthy tissues through different activation of tumor and normal cells [32\u201334]. However, the lowtemperature property in mild PTT may also produce insufficient and heterogeneous heat to the tumor, which causes subsequent survival and self-recurrence of tumor cells [34]. More importantly, the expression of the 90 KDa heat shock protein (HSP90) is sharply increased even with a temperature lower than 42 \u25e6C so that the therapeutic efficacy of mild PTT may be further limited [17,20,21,23,26,29,35\u201338]. Therefore, combinatory mild PTT and other therapeutics to overcome this drawback could be a better choice for optimal cancer treatment. As one of the HSP families, HSP90 displays an indispensable role in cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation [39\u201342]. Once the tumor cells are exposed to heat stimulation in PTT, HSP90 is overproduced in tumor cells to keep the cells alive. Therefore, it is also a promising targeting site to induce complete tumor cell ablation and boost the therapeutic efficacy in mild PTT [29,35,43]. In this contribution, we constructed an NIR-triggered dual-sensitized nanoplatform (BDPII-gel@TSL) based on a temperaturesensitive liposome (TSL), in which both HSP90 inhibitor (geldanamycin) and photothermal agent (aza-BODIPY) were encapsulated into TSL to realize a chemo\u2013photothermal synergistic therapy to effectively inhibit tumor growth at mild temperature (42 \u25e6C) (as shown in Scheme 1). The construction of TSL is widely used to improve the drug release in thermotherapy through external local heat trigged by light irradiation of photothermal agent (PTA) [44\u201347]. A recent study indicates that TSL with a composition of DPPC/DSPC/DSPEPEG-2000 is stable in biological media at 37 \u25e6C while undergoing a gel-to-liquid phased transition and inducing a 60% drug release at mild temperature (42 \u25e6C) (Scheme 1a). Thus it is a potential encapsulating shell applicable in mild PTT [11,47]. As an excellent PTA in this nano-system, aza-BODIPY displays strong NIR absorbance and near-infrared second window (NIR II) emission, which enables it to have a high photothermal conversion in PTT (as shown in Scheme 1b) [48\u201352]. In addition, geldanamycin can specifically bind to the HSP90 through the amine group to inhibit the overexpression of the protein and improve the heat sensitivity of cancer cells [40,53\u201355]. Additionally, the anticancer process of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs was turned on through the irradiation of 808 nm with a low power density (0.5 W cm\u22122), where the photothermal effect of BDPII in NPs was excited to generate a mild temperature (42 \u25e6C) and induce a phase transition of TSL to positive release the geldanamycin and BDPII, activating the chemo\u2013photothermal dual synergistic therapy. Then, the heat sensitivity of cancer cells was enhanced by the inhibition of HSP90, which enables considerable tumor cell death at a mild temperature produced by BDPII.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2252 3 of 15Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16\nScheme 1.

            "text": "PTAs with absorbance in NIR window are widely used in PTT for their high penetration ability and excellent optical performance, preferably at 808 nm for their high light\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2252 8 of 15\nharvesting and deep tissue penetration [24\u201328,60]. Unfortunately, NIR-triggered PTT is usually under the restriction of poor photostability, depressed light absorption capacity and low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of PTAs [26,28,58,61]. Among numerous reported NIR photothermal agents, aza-boron-dipyrrome-thenes (aza-BODIPY) derivatives are photostable materials with a high molar absorption coefficient at the NIR window, a favorable non-radiative excitation decay pathway to efficiently produce photothermal energy, and adjustable photophysical properties and easy functionalization, all of which endow great potential for aza-BODIPY-based PTAs in PTT application [28,50,62,63]. The donor-acceptor (D-A) molecular engineering favors strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and a narrow energy band gap [64], which facilitate a redshift of absorption to the NIR window and efficient fluorescent quenching to improve the PTT performance [65,66]. In this work, we used the electron-rich N,N-diethylaniline groups as electron donors and the classical aza-BODIPY electron-withdrawing cores as electron acceptors to construct the NIR photothermal agent (BDPII). The synthetic routes and characterization (NMR and ESI-Mass spectrum) of BDPII were shown in Figure 1a and Figures S1\u2013S12, respectively. Briefly, BDPII was enlarged through the conjugation of N,N-diethylaniline and phenol groups on 3,5-position and 1,7-position of the aza-BODIPY core, respectively. The large conjugating system of BDPII enabled its high extinction coefficient (\u03b5), and the strong charge transfer along the D-A backbone endowed a redshift to the NIR window as well as desirable PCE in the PTT application. As shown in Figure 1b and Table 1, the BDPII has two absorbance peaks visible in the NIR region, in which the short absorbance peak at about 639 nm is ascribed to the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition, and the long wavelength at about 808 nm is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect of BDPII [64,67,68]. Additionally, the BDPII also exhibits an excellent extinction coefficient at 808 nm of 30,980 mol\u22121 cm\u22121 (Figure 1c,d). Benefiting from the strong ICT effect of BDPII, the emission spectrum is enlarged to the NIR II window in the range of 900\u20131000 nm (Figure 1e). However, it is impressive that it also demonstrates strong fluorescence quenching in water with a fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6) of 0.56% (Figure 1f,g and Table 1) [69\u201371] in the measurements using a typical NIR II material IR 1061 (75%) as a standard (Figure S13). As indicated in Figure 1h, with the increase in solvent polarity, the fluorescent intensity of BDPII shows a notable decrease, and the emission wavelength presents a redshift, all of which demonstrate a strong solvatochromic effect for BDPII and result in its weak emission as shown in Figure 1e [72\u201374].\n3.2. Preparation of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs\nGenerally, a PTA with good water dispensability is required for biological application. Therefore, we used an ultrasonic method to formulate water-dispersible BDPIIgel@TSL with raw materials, including BDPII, geadanamycin and TSL, in which the TSL were prepared with the constituents of DPPC/DSPC/DSPE-PEG2000 by a molar ratio of 80:15:5 [11,56]. BDPII-gel@TSL was filtered through a syringe membrane with a pore size of 0.8 \u00b5m to remove the undesirable aggregates to achieve the relatively uniform-sized product. Owing to the hydrophobic core of BDPII and geldanamycin, as well as the hydrophilic shell of TSL, the BDPII and geldanamycin are inclined to locate in the phospholipid bilayer region (Figure 2a), in which the contents in TSL NPs were easily released upon heat triggering. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) results showed spherical morphologies for BDPII-gel@TSL NPs with an average diameter of about 137 nm (Figure 2b and Table S1). According to the time-dependent diameter monitored by DLS shown in Figure 2c and Table S1, they remained stable in water, PBS\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2252 9 of 15\nand DMEM over two weeks of storage at 4 \u25e6C, indicating excellent stability for potential biological application. In order to investigate the synergistic effect between BDPII and geldanamycin in mild PTT conditions, BDPII was solely encapsulated in TSL to form BDPII@TSL, according to the same preparing protocol as for BDPII-gel@TSL. The results from DLS and TEM demonstrate spherical morphologies for BDPII@TSL NPs with an average diameter of approximately 116 nm in water (Table S1, Figure S14a). Furthermore, it also shows good stability in water, PBS and DMEM with 4 \u25e6C storage for 15 days (Table S1, Figure S14b). Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 16\nFigure 2.

The temperature of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs in PBS solution displayed a dramatic increase upon 1 W cm\u22122 laser irradiation. Within 15 min of irradiation, the temperature of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs reached a temperature as high as 62.73 \u00b0C (Figure 3a). The corresponding infrared photos were recorded, as shown in Figure 3b. It was found that the temperature increase has a positive dependence on the concentration and laser power density (Figure 3c,d). Notably, the temperature could increase to 43 \u00b0C after 808 nm laser irradiation with 0.5 W cm\u22122 for 15 min (Figure 3d), which endows BDPIIgel@TSL NPs with potential in mild PTT application. The BDPII-gel@TSL NPs demonstrated no obvious photobleaching effect after multiple heating\u2013cooling cycles with laser irradiation (Figure 3e), suggesting excellent photothermal stability.

(g) The fluorescence intensity of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs with different irradiation times upon 808 nm excitation with the laser power of 0.5 W cm\u22122.\nThe fluorescence emission of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs was recorded and displayed in Figure 2d. Once BDPII molecules were encapsulated into TSL, the fluorescence intensity was notably enhanced, and the value of \u03a6 for BDPII-gel@TSL (6.85%) was ten times higher than that for BDPII (0.56%) (Figure 2e,f and Table 1), which is attributed to the sol-\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2252 10 of 15\nvatochromic effect of BDPII as shown in Figure 1h. That is to say, with the BDPII molecules successfully loaded in TSL to form BDPII-gel@TSL NPs, the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer region of TSL provides a non-polar environment for BDPII to exhibit strong emission. Therefore, the heat-triggered release of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs can be determined through fluorometry at 42 \u25e6C. As shown in Figure 2g, the fluorescence intensity of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs gradually decreases upon the irradiation for 0 min to 5 min (0.5 W cm\u22122, 808 nm), indicating the effective release of BDPII from the non-polar phospholipid bilayer of TSL into the polar medium (aqueous solution).\n3.3. Photothermal Performance of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs\nEncouraged by the excellent NIR absorption ability of BDPII, the photothermal performance for BDPII-gel@TSL NPs was further investigated upon 808 nm irradiation and shown in Figure 3. The temperature of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs in PBS solution displayed a dramatic increase upon 1 W cm\u22122 laser irradiation. Within 15 min of irradiation, the temperature of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs reached a temperature as high as 62.73 \u25e6C (Figure 3a). The corresponding infrared photos were recorded, as shown in Figure 3b. It was found that the temperature increase has a positive dependence on the concentration and laser power density (Figure 3c,d). Notably, the temperature could increase to 43 \u25e6C after 808 nm laser irradiation with 0.5 W cm\u22122 for 15 min (Figure 3d), which endows BDPII-gel@TSL NPs with potential in mild PTT application. The BDPII-gel@TSL NPs demonstrated no obvious photobleaching effect after multiple heating\u2013cooling cycles with laser irradiation (Figure 3e), suggesting excellent photothermal stability. According to the temperature curve shown in Figure 3a, the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of BDPII-gel@TSL NPs was calculated to be 80.75% (Figure 3f), which is quite high among previously reported PTAs [28,58,75], indicating its potential to be applied in mild PTT. The BDPII@TSL NPs exhibited an excellent PCE with a value of 78.70% (Figure S15), suggesting that the loading of geldanamycin hardly affects the optical properties of BDPII.

            "text": "Given the good photothermal conversion capability and high photostability of the BDPII-gel@TSL NPs, the tests, including cytotoxicity and combinatory photothermal and chemotherapeutic efficacy, were examined via standard MTT assay. The experimental groups included the geldanamycin group, BDPII@TSL group and BDPII-gel@TSL group. Initially, upon NIR irradiation (808 nm) with a lower power density (0.5 W cm\u22122) for 30 min, HeLa cells in both the geldanamycin and BDPII@TSL groups displayed moderate cytotoxicity at mild temperature (42 \u25e6C), as shown in Figure 4a. It was calculated that the values of IC50 for the geldanamycin and BDPII@TSL groups were as high as 53.27 \u00b5M and 43.16 \u00b5M (Figure 4b), respectively. As compared to the geldanamycin and BDPII@TSL groups, the BDPII-gel@TSL group displayed much lower cell viability under the same conditions, with a low IC50 value of 24.36 \u00b5M (Figure 4b). Reasonably, after exposure to light irradiation, the moderate temperature (42 \u25e6C) produced by the BDPII would initially destroy the nanostructure of BDPII-gel@TSL and cause the burst release of BDPII and geldanamycin. This synergistic effect of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy with a burst release manner led to the high ablation efficacy on tumor cells (Figure 4a). Under dark conditions, as shown in Figure 4c, the cell viability for BDPII@TSL displayed negligible change and maintained a more than 90% survival rate, indicating good biocompatibility for BDPII@TSL. It was found that the cell viability for geldanamycin showed an apparent decrease with an increase in concentration, which is ascribed to the intrinsic chemotherapy of geldanamycin. It is known that geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor, can cause proteasomedependent degradation and simultaneously disrupt some critical signal ways to the growth of cancer cells through the bond between geldanamycin and N-terminal ATPase structural domain of HSP90 [76]. However, while the geldanamycin molecules were loaded into TSL to form BDPII-gel@TSL NPs, the bond of geldanamycin to HSP90 was restrained, in which the anticancer effect of geldanamycin in BDPII-gel@TSL NPs was significantly suppressed, and the decrease in cell viability of BDPII-gel@TSL was much minor. = In addition, the small loss of HeLa cell viability in Figure 4c was attributed to the slight leakage of geldanamycin from BDPII-gel@TSL NPs into the cells during endocytosis. In order to vividly examine the mild PTT efficacy in vitro, the calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) kit assay were used to visualize the HeLa cell mortality under NIR irradiation. Calcein-AM was used to label the living cells and can easily penetrate into the cell membrane and be hydrolyzed into the calcein structure to emit strong green fluorescence. Propidium iodide (PI) is a dead cell marker and can selectively be embedded into DNA dead cells and yield red fluorescence. As shown in Figure 4d, after exposure to NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 0.5 W cm\u22122 for 30 min), the control group exhibited strong green emission with high cell activity, indicating that the low power density notably had no obvious influence on the cell viability. Owing to the sole therapeutic strategy of geldanamycin and BDPII as described in the MTT assay, the chemotherapy of geldanamycin and phototherapy of BDPII@TSL could merely compromise the cell viability less than 50%, and this means that the cells could be stained with both Calcein-AM and PI with green and red emission, respectively. In comparison, the cells incubated with BDPII-gel@TSL emit strong red fluorescence, indicating the synergistic photothermal and chemotherapeutic effects of the combination of BDPII and geldanamycin to effectively ablate cancer cells. Under dark conditions, the HeLa cells in both the control group and BDPII@TSL group exhibited strong green fluorescence, suggesting good biological compatibility of BDPII@TSL. The groups incubated with geldanamycin and BDPII-gel@TSL illustrate both green and red fluorescence without irradiation, indicating that the chemotherapy of geldanamycin partly inhibits tumor cell growth. Taken together, these results are consistent with the in vitro cytotoxicity results in Figure 4. Taken together, the NIR-activatable and mild-temperature-sensitive nanoplatform (BDPII-gel@TSL) is an efficient platform to ablate cancer cells in vitro.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2252 12 of 15\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 16\ncritical signal ways to the growth of cancer cells through the bond between geldanamycin and N-terminal ATPase structural domain of HSP90 [76].

            "text": "In summary, we developed a TSL-coated dual-sensitized nanoplatform BDPII-gel@TSL loaded with PTA (BDPII) and HSP90 in ibitor (g lda amycin) for highly efficient combinatory chemotherapy and mild photothermal therapy of cancer cells. The synthesized BDPII exhibited functioned as an excellent PTA with NIR optical performance via donor-acceptor molecular engineering, while the PCE for BDPII ould reach up to 80.73% upon the 808 nm irradiation. Importantly, BDPII nanoparti les could produce mild temperature (42 \u25e6C) upon 0.5 W cm\u22122 of 808 nm laser irradiation to induce the phase transform tion of TSL and stimulate the release of itself and g ldanamycin from TSL. Furthermore, the triggered release of geldanamycin could initially down-regulate the overexpres ion of HSP90 and construct a photothermal-ch mo synergistic therapy with BDPII to efficiently eradicate c - cer cells under mild PTT conditions.
