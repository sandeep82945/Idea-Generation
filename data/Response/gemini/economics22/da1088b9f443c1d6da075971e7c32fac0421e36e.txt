1. **Investigate the long-term effects of deep RTAs on residents' health.** The study examines the impact of deep RTAs on residents' health over a period of 9 years. However, it would be beneficial to conduct a longitudinal study to examine the long-term effects of deep RTAs on residents' health, as the effects may change over time.


2. **Analyze the impact of deep RTAs on specific health outcomes.** The study uses a general measure of residents' health, the personal health index. Future research could examine the impact of deep RTAs on specific health outcomes, such as mortality, morbidity, and mental health.


3. **Explore the role of different types of deep RTAs.** The study does not distinguish between different types of deep RTAs. Future research could examine whether the impact of deep RTAs on residents' health varies depending on the type of RTA, such as bilateral or multilateral agreements, or agreements that include environmental or labor provisions.


4. **Investigate the impact of deep RTAs on health equity.** The study does not examine the impact of deep RTAs on health equity. Future research could examine whether the impact of deep RTAs on residents' health varies across different socioeconomic groups, such as income, education, and race/ethnicity.


5. **Analyze the impact of deep RTAs on health care costs.** The study does not examine the impact of deep RTAs on health care costs. Future research could examine whether the impact of deep RTAs on residents' health is mediated by changes in health care costs.
