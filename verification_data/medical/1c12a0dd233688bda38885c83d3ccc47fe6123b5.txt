The portions of the text mentioning future research directions are:

1. "Considering their distinct target genes and roles in cellular processes, conducting a separate investigation into OCT4 in future studies will enable us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its function in controlling specific pathways. By studying them independently, we can unravel their unique functions and shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying their regulatory effects."

2. "However, further research is required to elucidate the precise mechanisms through which NANOG regulates PDK1 and understand its downstream effects on the PI3K/AKT pathway. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the PI3K/AKT pathway and its modulation by NANOG, it is crucial to investigate the involvement of other factors, both upstream and downstream, that interact with PDK1."

3. "Although further investigation on other signaling pathways to increase drug resistance in CSCs may be needed, these insights hold promise for deepening our understanding of drug resistance mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets to eliminate CSC, which can lead to the cure of GBM."
