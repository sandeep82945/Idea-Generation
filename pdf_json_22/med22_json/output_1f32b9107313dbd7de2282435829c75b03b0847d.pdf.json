    "abstractText": "Diclofenac is a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug and is clinically used for the treatment of osteoarthritis, non-articular rheumatism, etc. This research aimed to demonstrate the creation of an upgraded photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptamer sensor for detecting diclofenac (DCF) with high sensitivity. In this work, photoactive materials and bio-identification components served as visible-light-active CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6 heterostructures and aptamers, respectively. CuS and MoS2/Bi2WO6 were combined to improve photocurrent responsiveness, which helped the structure of PEC aptasensors. Additionally, the one-pot synthesis of CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6 was ecologically beneficial. With these optimizations, the photocurrent response of aptamer/CS/CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6 exhibited linearity between 0.1 and 500 nM DCF. The detection limit was 0.03 nM (S/N = 3). These results suggest that the PEC sensing technique might produce an ultra-sensitive sensor with high selectivity and stability for DCF detection.",

            "text": "Diclofenac (DCF) is a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) marketed for global consumption [1]. It has been utilized for surgical procedures such as gynecological, orthopedic, and ontological procedures [2]. Additionally, DCF specializes in the treatment of osteoarthritis, renal and biliary cramps, pharyngotonsillitis, otitis, annexites, and primary dysmenorrhea, as well as various infection-related pain operations [1\u20133]. According to a study in 2018, around half of the original medication was metabolized; moreover, 70% of pharmaceuticals was excreted via urine, despite diverse conditions occurring in relation to those targeted drugs [4]. The risk assessment of drug toxicity revealed that, according to data on the DCF presence in wastewater following standard biological treatment, around 80% of the original pollutant was retained [5]. Inefficient effluent treatment plants that failed to eliminate drugs from wastewater were utilized to develop four drug detection techniques. Many methods have been employed for DCF detection, such as immunoassays, chromatographic techniques, and electrochemical methods [6\u20138]. Clearly, these techniques, which provide the efficient detection of DCF at concentrations ranging from M to nM, are not without limitations, including the requirement for costly equipment. Additionally, they consume significantly more time and need complicated preprocessing, limiting their practical applicability [9,10]. As a result, a sensitive and selective sensor capable of providing more promptness and ease for DCF detection needs to be built. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors, which specialize in high sensitivity, simply structured instruments, easily conducted downsizing, and low prices, have previously attracted academics to conduct research on them [11\u201313]. When developing PEC sensors, improved photocatalyst performance contributes to increased sensitivity. Nonetheless, PEC sensing must rely on photocatalytic processes that lack analyte specificity. To overcome the issue, significant efforts have been made to improve the selectivity of PEC sensors by including\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2834. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12162834 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2834 2 of 15\nnumerous recognition components such as molecular-imprinted polymers, enzymes, antibodies, and aptamers [14,15]. In terms of these factors, aptamers, well-known antibody mimetics with excellent recognition capacity over particular targets, have been used to build highly selective PEC aptasensors orientated with a more extensive variety of analytes consisting of inorganic ions, proteins, cells, antibiotics, and chemical substances. Some bismuth-based semiconductors also have a hybrid orbital of Bi 6s and O 2p, decreasing the bandgap while generating a deep valance band, such as BiOI, Bi2S3, Bi2XO6 (X = Mo, W), and others [16,17]. These elements, characterized by abundance, low toxicity, and low cost, have become the target of intense studies in PEC research [18]. Furthermore, the morphological structure of Bi2WO6, which includes Bi2O2 layers and WO6 octahedral structure layers, has a significant impact on its physical and chemical characteristics [19]. Furthermore, Bi2WO6 is one of the possible visible-light-driven photocatalysts with a moderate band gap (approximately 2.5 eV) [20]. More Bi2WO6 uses emerged in recent years, including PEC solar cells, PEC sensors, and photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation [21\u201323]. However, high-degree recombination specialized in photoexcited carriers, comparably weak light consumption capacity in pure Bi2WO6, and specialized poor photocatalytic activity severely restricted the highlighted practical uses in the environment [24]. As a result, significant efforts have been undertaken to address these shortcomings. Semiconductor coupling and metal particle deposition coupling with carbon materials are two examples [23,24]. MoS2 exhibits a photocatalytic capability due to its differentially specialized structure of sandwich layers of S\u2013Mo\u2013S atoms [25]. Furthermore, according to the current study, MoS2 has better photocatalytic activity because to its differentiated electrical and optical characteristics and large surface area [26]. As a result, MoS2 was used in numerous materials, including BiVO4 [18], WS2 [26], and TiO2 [27], to increase electron\u2013hole pair separation and PEC performance. Semiconductor chalcogenides have attracted tremendous attention with high abundance and low cost. Copper sulfide (CuS), which performs the duty of p-type semiconductors, presents availability, versatility, low toxicity, etc. [28]. Moreover, it also has unique electronic and optical properties, with additional applications to catalysis, solar cell, sensing, and lithium-ion batteries. CuS, a narrow-band gap semiconducting material (approximately 1.7 eV), is employed for coupling with bismuth-based semiconductors for enhanced photocatalytic performance [29,30]. Based on the abovementioned background research, a CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6 photoactive material was developed. By demonstrating greater photocurrents, CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6 extended the light response to the visible region beyond the elements of Bi2WO6 and MoS2/Bi2WO6 alone. As a result of the increased photo-to-current efficiency, it was proven that Bi2WO6 sensitized with CuS and MoS2 may promote photogenerated electron-hole pair separation. The improved CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6 photoactive material enabled the unification of a large linear range with a low detection limit, resulting in a successful PEC aptasensor for DCF detection. This novel PEC sensing strategy provides a highly selective and robust detection method for DCF detection. Moreover, the sensor also has good application prospects in practical applications. This also demonstrates the enormous potential of CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6 nanocomposites in fields such as PEC sensing, photocatalysis, and others."

According to Figure 4A, after MoS2 and CuS were included in the structure of Bi2WO6, the visible light range offered a location for the broad absorption band. This might have been due to the enhanced visible-light absorptivity conferred by MoS2 and CuS [39]. Accordingly, CuS- and MoS2-sensitized Bi2WO6 was designed to exhibit superior photocatalytic activity in the visible area due to heterojunction formation, sensitivity, and rapid charge transfer kinetics [40].

Because of the expected acceleration of electron transport, the photocurrent intensity increased significantly after adding CuS nanoparticles (curve II). When the electron donor solution of ascorbic acid (AA) and the electrode surface of CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6-5% met with the impeded electron exchange, the photocurrent density gradually decreased when CS and aptamer (curves III and IV) were added.

The binding of DCF resulted in increased photocurrent (curve IV), which most likely resulted in DCF oxidation and electron transport to the counter electrode. When the aptamer recognizes the detection target, the magnitude of change in the photocurrent plays a critical role in the sensitivity of the photoelectrochemical aptamer analysis.

In the absence of DCF, the electron transfer rate may have been considerably enhanced because the CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6-5% composite could absorb the energy of the UV and light source. As an electron donor, ascorbic acid could consume holes in the semiconductor material, reduce the electron\u2013hole recombination rate of the material, and could amplify the photocurrent signal, thereby reducing the error caused by the small change in the current data after adding DCF. Furthermore, the sensing electrode altered the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs and showed a noticeable photocurrent response. Further oxidization was carried out under the photogenerated holes when the aptamer connected with the target DCF. As a result, the sensing electrode\u2019s current was accelerated, resulting in a significant increase in photocurrent intensity.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15 The low photocurrent intensity shown by the CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6-5% electrode resulted from a high electron\u2013hole pair recombination rate (Figure 6B). Because of the expected acceleration of electron transport, the photocurrent intensity increased significantly after adding CuS nanoparticles (curve II). When the electron donor solution of ascorbic acid (AA) and the electrode surface of CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6-5% met with the impeded electron exchange, the photocurrent density gradually decreased when CS and aptamer (curves III and IV) were added. The aptamer sensor was found be successfully constructed. The binding of DCF resulted in increased photocurrent (curve IV), which most likely resulted in DCF oxidation and electron transport to the counter electrode.\nWhen the aptamer recognizes the detection target, the magnitude of change in the photocurrent plays a critical role in the sensitivity of the photoelectrochemical aptamer analysis. This study shows the aptamer analysis method\u2019s design. The photocurrent response characterization experiments described above specialized in ultra-high sensitivity, which stems from the two elements listed below. The schematic diagram could be used to represent the preparation process of the intended aptamer sensor in order to obtain an explicit interpretation (Scheme 2) [42\u201344]. In the absence of DCF, the electron transfer rate may have been considerably enhanced because the CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6-5% composite could absorb the energy of the UV and light source. As an electron donor, ascorbic acid could consume holes in the semiconductor material, reduce the electron\u2013hole recombination rate of the material, and could amplify the photocurrent signal, thereby reducing the error caused by the small change in the current data after adding DCF. F rthermore, the sensing electrode altered the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs and show d a noticeable photocurrent response. Further oxidization was carried out under the photogenerated holes when the aptamer connected with the target DCF. As a result, the sensing electrode\u2019s current was accelerated, resulting in a significant increase in photocurrent intensity.\nScheme 2.

During the detection process, the pH of the electrolyte, a critical component of the PEC performance, must be optimized (Figure 7B).

DCF is clinically used for osteoarthritis and non-articular rheumatism, in which the PEC aptamer sensor will have great application prospects. The CS/CuS/MoS2/Bi2WO6 heterostructure plays a critical role in the photocurrent response of the PEC sensor, which operated across a broad linear range of 0.1\u2013500 nM with a detection limit of 0.03 nM, exceeding the detection limit and linearity of typically modified electrodes. This novel PEC sensing strategy provided an ultra-sensitive sensor with high selectivity and stability for DCF detection.
