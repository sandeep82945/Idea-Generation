By perturbing the initial conditions of these periodic orbits, we detected the following five types of orbital structures in the 4D spaces of section: (i) Ring-like structures, sticky for large time intervals to the unstable invariant manifolds of the simple and double unstable vertical Lyapunov periodic orbits. (ii) 2D tori belonging to quasi-periodic orbits around stable periodic orbits existing in the region. They are associated either with vertical stable periodic orbits around L4,5 or with \u201cstable anomalous\u201d periodic orbits. (iii) Orbits sticky for large time intervals to these tori, forming \u201csticky tori\u201d, before they slowly depart from them. (iv) Clouds of points that have a strong chaotic behavior. Such clouds of consequents have slow diffusion speeds, because they are hindered by the presence of the tori around the \u201cstable anomalous\u201d periodic orbits. (v) Toroidal zones consisting of points that stick for long time on the unstable invariant manifolds of the \u201cunstable anomalous\u201d periodic orbits. By continuing the integration, we find that eventually they become strongly chaotic, retaining however small diffusion speeds, due to the presence of the tori around the stable anomalous periodic orbits.",

            "text": "In this paper we study the phase space in the vicinity of \u201cvertical\u201d Lyapunov periodic orbits around the unstable Lagrangian points L1,2 of a three dimensional (3D) model for barred galaxies.\nThere are two families of (Lyapunov) periodic orbits (POs) around L1,2, namely the planar (pLPO) (see e.g. Romero-Go\u0301mez et al. 2009; Tsoutsis et al. 2009; Sa\u0301nchez-Martin et al. 2016) and the vertical (vLPO) family (Olle\u0301 and Pfenniger 1998; RomeroGo\u0301mez et al. 2009). The latter orbits are called \u201cvertical\u201d, due to their orientation with respect to the equatorial plane. In effect, there are two vLPO families, one around L1 and another around L2, thus whenever needed to be distinguished, we will call them vLPO1 and vLPO2, respectively. The same occurs for the equilibrium points L4,5 and we will call the corresponding vLPO families as vLPO4 and vLPO5, respectively.\nWe want to examine the phase space close to vLPOs, at the ends of a bar. In order to achieve this goal, we investigate the role of stickiness in three dimensions around equilibrium points, as well as the role of the phase space environment in hindering orbits with initial conditions in the neighborhood of the vLPO\u2019s to diffuse to large chaotic seas. Thus, knowledge of the presence and stability of\n? mkatsan@academyofathens.gr (MK) \u2020 patsis@academyofathens.gr (PAP)\nother POs in the region is important in our study. Furthermore, we want to study the relationship between diffusion and chaoticity of the orbits, which is a general problem in dynamical astronomy and nonlinear dynamics.\nA standard method for studying the structure of phase space is by means of spaces of section. As described in standard textbooks about nonlinear phenomena in Hamiltonian systems (see e.g. Contopoulos 2004, section 2.11.11), a 3D galactic Hamiltonian model has a 6D phase space, which is reduced by the Jacobi constant in time-independent models to a 5D space. By considering a space of section, we establish a well defined 4D symplectic map (Poincare\u0301 map) (Poincare\u0301 1892) in a 4D phase space. Eventually, the study of the 6D phase space of a 3D autonomous Hamiltonian system ends up to the study of the 4D phase space of a 4D symplectic map.\nThe basic problem of the study of the 4D phase space is its visualization. Several methods have been proposed in the past for the visualization of the 4D phase space: 2D and 3D projections (Contopoulos & Barbanis 1989; Vrahatis et al. 1997), stereoscopic projections (Froeschle\u0301 1970; Contopoulos et al. 1982), 2D and 3D slices of 3D subspaces (Froeschle\u0301 1970; Froeschle\u0301 1972; Richter et al. 2014), the method of color and rotation (Patsis & Zachilas 1994; Katsanikas & Patsis 2011) and the method of Lagrangian Descriptors (Agaoglou et al. 2019, 2020a,b). As in many of our previous studies, in our present work we use the method of color and rotation. Briefly, in this method we plot an orbit in a 3D sub-\n\u00a9 0000 RAS\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n10 24\n9v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\nA ]\n2 1"

Finally, we color every point of this 3D projection, i.e. each consequent, according to its fourth coordinate. The rotation helps us in order to understand the 3D topology of the structures in the phase space. The color variation indicates if this topology exists in the 4D space or not. This method helps us to distinguish between order and chaos by relating specific 3D structures accompanied by specific patterns of color, to specific cases of orbital stability (see section 3). The method has been used in galactic Dynamics (Katsanikas & Patsis 2011; Katsanikas et al. 2011b,a, 2013; Patsis and Katsanikas 2014a,b), in a 4D symplectic map (Zachilas et al. 2013), in Astrodynamics (Geisel 2013) and in a system of spinning test particle moving in the spacetime background of a Kerr black hole (Lukes-Gerakopoulos et al. 2016).\nAn important phenomenon that is crucial for the study of the phase space, and plays crucial role in our paper, is the phenomenon of stickiness. There are two kinds of stickiness:\n(i) Stickiness on tori: In the neighborhood of a stable periodic orbit, the KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) theorem (see Kolmogorov 1954; Arnold 1963; Moser 1962), guarantees the existence of N-dimensional invariant tori in Hamiltonian systems with N degrees of freedom. When the perturbation increases a particular torus is destroyed and it becomes a cantorus, a Cantor set of points that is nowhere dense, (see for example Contopoulos 2004, section 2.7). This object has a countable infinity of gaps. When a last KAM torus is destroyed, the small chaotic regions that were inside it are connected with the large chaotic sea that surrounds this last KAM torus. This can happen after a long integration time. This means that the region just inside a cantorus is characterized by a large density of points for long time intervals before these points start to diffuse in the large chaotic sea. This is the phenomenon of stickiness and the formed region is called a sticky torus. Stickiness has been extensively studied in Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom (see for example Contopoulos 2004) and in Hamiltonian systems of three degrees of freedom (see for example Katsanikas & Patsis 2011).\n(ii) Stickiness in chaos: In the neighborhood of unstable periodic orbits, there are two kinds of invariant manifolds, the unstable and stable invariant manifolds (see for example Contopoulos 2004, section 2.5). All orbits with initial conditions on these objects approach the periodic orbit (stable manifold) and move away from the periodic orbit (unstable manifold). In some cases, orbits are stuck for a long time interval in a specific chaotic region of the phase space far away from the invariant tori. This is due to the fact that these orbits are stuck for a long time interval on the unstable invariant manifolds of unstable periodic orbits (see Contopoulos & Harsoula 2013). This is the phenomenon of stickiness in chaos and it has been studied in Hamiltonian systems with two (Contopoulos & Harsoula 2013) and three (Katsanikas et al. 2013) degrees of freedom.\nThe phenomenon of stickiness refers to chaotic orbits that remain in a specific region of the phase space for a significant time interval. It has to be distinguished from another category of chaotic orbits, that remain in a specific region of the phase space, which is the partially chaotic orbits that obey one isolating integral besides the energy and are bounded by regular orbits (see Muzzio 2017, 2018; Carpintero & Muzzio 2020). Latter, it will not be discussed in the present paper.\nIn section 2, and in section 3 we briefly present the model which we use and some definitions related to the stability and the\nmorphology of periodic orbits. In section 4, we study the phase space of our system using the method of 4D spaces of section and we compare our results with Lyapunov Characteristic Numbers. In section 5, we compute the diffusion speed for the different types of phase space objects we encountered in our study. Finally, we discuss our results and we present our conclusions in section 6."

            "text": "For the purposes of the present paper, we will continue using the Ferrers bar model we have already used in several papers in the past (e.g. Skokos et al. 2002a; Patsis and Katsanikas 2014a; Patsis & Athanassoula 2019; Patsis et al. 2022). It is a popular and extensively studied model for 3D bars, initially used by Pfenniger (1984). The general model consists of a Miyamoto disc, a Plummer bulge and a 3D Ferrers bar. As this part of information is repeated in all the above mentioned papers, we avoid giving it again here and we restrict ourselves in a general description of the model and in giving the values of the parameters we used. For details the reader is referred to the above mentioned papers.\nThe Miyamoto disc has horizontal and vertical scale lengths, A and B respectively, while its total mass is MD. The total mass of the spheroidal Plummer bulge is MS and its scale length is s. The numerical values of these parameters are given in in Table 1.\nFor the axes of the Ferrers bar we set a : b : c = 6 : 1.5 : 0.6, as in Pfenniger (1984), while is mass is MB. The masses of the three components satisfy G(MD + MS + MB) = 1, where G is the gravitational constant. The length unit has been taken as 1 kpc, the time unit as 1 Myr and the mass unit as 2\u00d71011 M . If not otherwise indicated, the lengths mentioned everywhere in the paper are in kpc. Units will be not repeated on the axes of the figures.\nThe total potential of our model is given in Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) by\n\u03a6(x, y, z) = \u03a6D + \u03a6S + \u03a6B, (1)\nwhere \u03a6D,\u03a6S and \u03a6B are the potentials of the disk, the bulge (spheroid) and the bar respectively.\nThe 3D bar is rotating around its short z axis counterclockwise, with an angular speed \u2126b. The x axis is the intermediate and the y axis the long one. The equations of motion are derived from the Hamiltonian governing the motion of a test-particle. It can be written in the form:\nH = 1 2 (p2x + p 2 y + p 2 z ) + \u03a6(x, y, z) \u2212\u2126b(xpy \u2212 ypx), (2)\nwhere px, py, and pz are the canonically conjugate momenta. We will hereafter denote the numerical value of the Hamiltonian by E j and refer to it as the Jacobi constant or, more loosely, as the \u2018energy\u2019.\nThe parameters referring to the masses of the three components, the pattern speed, the E j\u2019s of the important for our study resonances and the corotation distance, can also be found in Table 1."

            "text": "The space of section of 3D systems is 4D. In order to study the vertical periodic orbits around the Lagrangian points L1,2 we use the space of section z=0, pz > 0 and we integrate the equations of motion for a given value of the Hamiltonian. Our initial conditions are (x0, px0 , y0, py0 ). We find the initial conditions for a PO by using a\n\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe phase space around L1,2 3\nNewton iterative method. We consider a PO as been located, when the initial and final coordinates coincide with an accuracy of at least 10\u221211. We used a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme for the numerical integration of the periodic orbits, keeping the relative error in the energy smaller than 10\u221215.\nIn order to compute the stability of a PO we follow the method of Broucke (1969). For this, we first consider small deviations from its initial conditions in the space of section z=0, pz > 0 and we integrate this \u201cperturbed\u201d orbit to the next upward intersection with the space of section. In this way a 4D map T : R4 \u2192 R4 is established, which relates the initial with the final point. The relation of the final deviations of this, neighboring to the periodic orbit, to the initially introduced deviations, can be written in vector form as: ~\u03be = M ~\u03be0. Here ~\u03be is the final deviation, ~\u03be0 is the initial deviation and M is a 4\u00d7 4 matrix, called the monodromy matrix. The eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix can determine the kind of linear stability of a periodic orbit. If a periodic orbit has two pairs of eigenvalues on the unit circle, it is stable. Otherwise, the periodic orbit is unstable. There are three kinds of instability for periodic orbits: simple instability, double instability, and complex instability. Simple and double instability are the cases where the periodic orbits have one pair of eigenvalues on the unit circle and one on the real axis (simple instability) or two pairs on the real axis (double instability), as described in Contopoulos & Magnenat (1985). Finally, complex instability (see eg. Contopoulos & Magnenat 1985; Pfenniger 1985a,b; Zachilas 1993; Patsis & Zachilas 1990; Sto\u0308ber & Ba\u0308cker 2021; Patsis et al. 2022; Jorba & Olle 2004) is the case in which the eigenvalues of the periodic orbits form a complex quadruplet that is off the unit circle.\nIn order to have an overall impression for the dynamical behaviour of the two vLPO families, which have as origin either of the Lagrangian points L1,2, we computed their orbits and we followed the evolution of their stability by means of the Broucke method. These orbits have on the 4D space of section initial conditions (x0, px0 , y0, py0 ) with (0, y > 0, px < 0, 0) and (0, y < 0, px > 0, 0)\nrespectively. Following the evolution of their b1 and b2 indices (Contopoulos & Magnenat 1985), we found that they are in general simple unstable, with a rather small double unstable energy interval for \u22120.1876 < E j < \u22120.1707, which is located beyond E j(L4,5).\nThe morphology of the members of the vLPO family have a \u201cbent-eight\u201d morphology (red orbits in Fig. 1), similar to the morphology of the vertical families around the stable Lagrangian points L4,5 (green orbits in Fig. 1). This is in agreement with the findings of Olle\u0301 and Pfenniger (1998) and Romero-Go\u0301mez et al. (2009). The depicted in Fig. 1 vLPO\u2019s, at E j = \u22120.165, reach heights |z| \u2248 3.7 away from the equatorial plane. In Fig. 1 we give also the representatives of two families introduced by Heisler et al. (1982), namely of the stable and unstable anomalous orbits (sao and uao respectively). The role of these families will be examined in section 4.5. The positions of the periodic orbits of these families in the Poincare\u0301 section z = 0 with pz > 0 (for value of energy E j = \u22120.165) are given in table 2."

            "text": "The first type of structure we encounter in the neighborhood of vLPOs around L1,2 in phase space, is a ring-like one, resembling a double crescent, with the two crescents facing and touching each other at their horns. Hereafter, we will briefly refer to this shape as the \u201cdouble-crescent\u201d. The fourth dimension in this case follows the topology of this structure in the 3D subspace of the phase space as the color-rotation method reveals. An example is given in Fig. 2. In order to obtain the depicted orbit, we have considered the simple unstable vLPO at E j = \u22120.165 and we applied a perturbation \u2206y = 10\u22124 in its initial conditions. However, we obtain similar double-crescent structures, by applying perturbation: \u22125 6 \u2206x 6 5.2, \u22123.9 6 \u2206y 6 4, \u22120.02 6 \u2206px 6 0.09 and \u22120.2 6 \u2206py 6 0.2 For initial conditions outside these ranges we may find clouds of points or we cross the surface of zero velocity and then we are beyond the phase space region in which we are allowed to integrate our orbits. (We remind that E j = \u22120.165 > E j(L4,5) > E j(L1,2)).\nThe structure depicted in Fig. 2 consists of the first 190 con-\nsequents of the orbit in the 4D space of section. These 190 consequents, correspond already to t = 13 Gyrs. For finding the chaoticity of these orbits we have to extend our calculations to unrealistic large time intervals. However, this allows us to understand the underlying dynamical mechanism and also helps us estimating the expected orbital dynamics in specific volumes of the phase space. It can be considered as confined within a narrow cylinder with dimensions about [\u221210, 10] \u00d7 [\u22128, 8] in the (x, y) plane and a much smaller thickness of about 0.6 in the third dimension px. The py \u201ccolours\u201d, evidently, follow a smooth color variation (cf. with the color bar at the right-hand side of the figure) which reflects the fact that the consequents are on, or at least close to, a smooth surface in the 4D space. However, if we continue integrating the orbit, the consequents start diffusing in the surrounding phase space and we observe a mixing of colors. For other double crescent orbits, with initial conditions in the previously indicated ranges, this happens even earlier, when the orbits have formed only part of the doublecrescent structure. At any rate, this evolution clearly indicates stickiness, or a weakly chaotic behaviour.\nWhen diffusion starts, the consequents form eventually a cloud where colors are mixed. The scattering of points in the 3D subspace and the mixing of colors indicate the strong chaotic behavior and the transition from the state of stickiness to the state of strong chaoticity. Furthermore, we observe that the diffusion of points leads to the occupation of a larger volume in phase space. As we see in Fig. 3, already for 382 intersections of the orbit with the space of section the occupied volume is [x1, x2] \u00d7 [y1, y2] \u00d7 [px1, px2] \u00d7 [py1, py2] = [\u221220, 25] \u00d7 [\u221230, 40] \u00d7 [\u22120.4, 0.4] \u00d7 [\u22120.4, 0.4]. This is a larger volume than the one of the narrow cylinder within which the first 190 consequents are confined. We also observe that the 382 consequents drift away from the vLPOs mainly on the (x, y) plane, while their |py| values increase their extent by 33% with respect to the values during the first 190 intersections. Eventually the points form clouds like these that are described in the next subsection.\nThe orbit in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, integrated over one Hubble time in the (x, y, z) space is given in Fig. 4. The (x, y) projection retains a double-crescent morphology similar to the one we have found existing in the (x, y, px) space in Fig. 2. Nevertheless, we have to keep in mind that in Fig. 2 we depict a space of section, while in Fig. 4 we plot the orbit in the configuration space.

Although this structure is expected to be supported by planar orbits (see e.g. figure 21 in Kaufmann & Contopoulos 1996), we see that the projection of sticky orbits reaching high z retains this morphology.\nAs we can observe in the left panel of Fig. 4, the orbit spends more time in the neighborhood of L1 and L2, which results in the formation of two dense regions around the two unstable equilibrium points in the face-on, (x, y), view. In the end-on, (x, z) projection, these two dense regions correspond to the central, dense part, filling roughly a (\u22124, 4) \u00d7 (\u22124, 4) region, while the orbit extends in the x-direction close to a distance from the center of about 8. Finally, in the side-on, (y, z), projection, these two dense regions coincide with the two parenthesis-like arcs at the sides of this projection of the orbit (Fig. 4 right panel).\nIn order to estimate the chaoticity of the orbit, we used the standard \u201cfinite time\u201d Lyapunov Characteristic Number indicator (see e.g. Contopoulos 2004, section 2.10 and references therein). For this we computed the quantity LCN(t) = 1 t ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03be(t)\u03be(t0)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223, in which \u03be(t0) and \u03be(t) are the distances between two points of two nearby orbits at times t = 0 and t respectively. The evolution of LCN(t) with time is given in Fig. 5. We observe that it has some fluctuations until the time at which the consequents leave the double-crescent structure (indicated with an arrow). Thereinafter, it increases slowly but constantly, tending to a positive value equal to 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22123. This evolution confirms the sticky-chaotic character of the orbit."

The orbit is integrated again for a Hubble time, which corresponds now to 343 intersections with the z = 0 plane. These initial conditions lead to an irregular morphology of an orbit. Nevertheless, the orbit during the integration period, remains inside corotation. This is a counter-intuitive result, since the energy of the orbit is larger than the energy of the Lagrangian points at corotation, starting however well inside the corotation radius Rc = RL1 = 6.31.\nDespite the fact that the clouds of points indicate a strong chaotic behavior, their consequents remain confined in the 4D space of section within a region [\u22128, 8]\u00d7 [\u22126, 6]\u00d7 [\u22121, 1]\u00d7 [\u22121, 1], which corresponds to a smaller volume than the region occupied by the 190 consequents of the sticky, double-crescent orbit in Fig. 2.

These invariant tori are 2D objects in the 4D space of section. Such objects are the invariant tori around the periodic orbits vLPO4,5 . The POs of these families are stable and have initial conditions (x > 0, 0, 0, py > 0) (for L4) and (x < 0, 0, 0, py < 0) (for L5). An example of these tori is given in Fig. 9, depicting the perturbed by \u2206x = 0.6 vertical PO around L4. This torus has in the 4D space of section the morphology of a rotational torus (Vrahatis et al. 1997; Vrahatis et al. 1996). This kind of tori have a smooth color variation on their surfaces, if we colour the consequents of the orbit according to their values in the fourth dimension (Katsanikas & Patsis 2011).\nBy increasing further the perturbation of the initial conditions of the vLPO4 along the x-direction, we encounter a different dynamical behaviour for \u2206x = 1.3. In this case we initially find again a rotational-torus-like structure considering the first 17120 consequents, but for larger integration times the consequents start occupying a larger volume around the periodic orbit (Fig. 10). This is the phenomenon of stickiness on tori (see introduction), as encountered in the case of the tori around stable POs in 3D autonomous Hamiltonian systems. During the sticky period of an orbit it forms a torus-like orbit, which was called sticky torus in Katsanikas & Patsis (2011). Such tori are unstable and present a weak chaotic behavior. For usual time scales in Galactic Dynamics, the dynamical behavior of such orbits can be considered practically identical to that of regular orbits.\nThis weak chaotic behavior can be also identified by means of the finite time LCN(t). However, we need an even larger integration time, than the integration time used when applying the method of color and rotation, in order to appreciate it. In Fig. 11, we observe that the LCN(t), which corresponds to the invariant torus of the Fig. 9 (black curve) tends to zero. During the same time interval, the LCN(t) that corresponds to the sticky torus of Fig. 10 (red curve), initially decreases, behaving like the LCN(t) of an ordered orbit. However, at t=315000, it starts increasing and finally it tends to a relatively small positive number 10\u22124. The LCN(t) identifies the weak chaotic behavior of the sticky torus after 325000 time units, thus this index traces the chaotic behaviour slower than the method of color and rotation.\nThe difference between this kind of sticky behaviour and the\n\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000"

This is presented in Fig. 12. The initial conditions of the vLPOs around L1 and L2 are marked with two black squares at y > 0 and y < 0 respectively. Besides the vertical families around L1,2 we have also the vertical families around the stable equilibrium points L4,5. In Fig. 12 their locations are indicated with two black \u201c*\u201d symbols.\nIn Fig. 12, apart from the location of the POs and the projections of the tori, we also plot the projections on the (x, y) plane of the asymptotic curves of the unstable invariant manifolds of the two simple unstable vLPOs around L1,2.

The POs of the zaxis family lie entirely along the rotating z-axis, i.e. and can be considered as the vertical Lyapunov family of the Lagrangian point L3. They have initial conditions (x, y, px, py) = (0, 0, 0, 0) in the 4D space of section. Heisler et al. (1982) computed this family as well as its two bifurcations, which they named stable and unstable anomalous orbits (sao and uao respectively). Both of these families have at each energy two symmetric representatives. Specifically, the two sao orbits have initial conditions (x > 0, 0, 0, py < 0) and (x < 0, 0, 0, py > 0) and the two uao (0, y > 0, px > 0, 0) and (0, y < 0, px < 0, 0).

The origin of this behaviour becomes apparent by inspection of Fig. 13, where we present an orbit perturbed by \u2206y = 10\u22123. We remind that we observe the same behaviour also for larger perturbations. For example we obtain the same orbit depicted in Fig. 6, also by applying a \u2206y = 2.035 to the initial conditions of the z-axis orbit. The existence of the magenta invariant tori around the two sao orbits, assisted by the presence of the blue invariant tori around the vertical POs around L4,5 hinder the diffusion of the chaotic orbits and keep them trapped in the central region of the (x, y, px) projection. The few consequents that overcome the two tori barriers stick on the blue tori that are around the vL4,5 (Fig. 13).\nPerturbations of the bifurcations of the z-axis (sao and uao) lead to different structures in phase space, as expected, since the sao orbits are stable while those of the uao families are unstable. Perturbations of sao lead to quasi periodic orbits, the tori of which have been presented in Fig. 12. On the other hand, by adding even tiny perturbations, like \u2206x = 10\u22123, in the initial conditions of the uao POs, we find in the 3D (x, y, px) subspace ring-like objects.

The consequents do not lie on a smooth surface in this 3D projection.We observe that the consequents building this structure have a rather smooth color variation, albeit some points already are departing from it at the end of the integration time. All these point to a weakly chaotic orbit. Its morphology in the configuration space, integrated over a Hubble time, is given in Fig. 15. It remains confined in a (x, y, z) region [\u22123, 3] \u00d7 [\u22123, 3] \u00d7 [\u22123, 3], with a toroidal face-on and a spheroidal edge-on view.\nWe computed the unstable invariant manifolds of the simple unstable uao POs, as well as of its symmetric family, and we present them for E j = \u22120.165 in Fig. 16, with green and cyan color respectively. For the computation we followed again the steps described in detail in Katsanikas et al. (2013). Also in this case the unstable asymptotic curves of a simple unstable PO are guided from the invariant tori that exist in the region. In the present case, they are guided by the invariant tori around the two sao orbits, drawn with magenta color in Fig. 16.\nThe first 700 consequents of the toroidal structure depicted in Fig. 14 stick on the unstable invariant manifolds of the two uao POs (Fig. 16). We observe again the presence of stickiness in chaos, as in the case of the double-crescent structure (Fig. 12). However, as expected for a sticky orbit, by continuing the integration, we have a transition from the toroidal-like structure depicted in Fig. 14, to a cloud of points, with mixing of colors in the fourth dimension and a strongly chaotic behaviour of the orbit.\nThis transition is reflected also in the variation of its LCN(t). In Fig. 17 we observe a behaviour of this chaos indicator similar to that of the orbit in Fig. 5. Beyond the point indicated with an arrow, it levels off at a positive number of the order of 10\u22122. Nevertheless, again due to the presence of the magenta tori in Fig. 16, the consequents of the toroidal structure remain confined for a long time in a restricted zone of phase space and this is also compatible with the morphology of the orbit in the configuration space (Fig. 15)."

            "text": "We come now to the study of the diffusion of chaotic orbits located in the neighborhood of the vLPOs around L1,2. The four types of chaotic orbits we discussed in Section 4 are the double-crescent\nstructures, the clouds of points, the sticky tori (that are around vLPO4,5 and sao orbits) and the toroidal structures close to the periodic orbits of uao and its symmetric one. For these types of orbits we computed their diffusion speed as defined in Katsanikas et al. (2013). The estimation of the diffusion is based on the estimation of Vd, the diffusion volume. For this we compute, as time increases, the volume of the hypersphere on the 4D space of section, with center the position of the periodic orbit and radius the mean distance of the consequents from the periodic orbit. The diagram of Vd versus t gives us valuable information about the diffusion of the orbits. We call Td (diffusion time) the time needed by an orbit to reach the maximum Vd (Vmax), while the ratio Vmax/Td gives us what we call \u201cdiffusion speed\u201d, ud (Katsanikas et al. 2013). We underline the fact that the most important information is obtained through the diagram Vd versus t (the information given by Vmax and by the diffusion speed is complementary). This diagram can distinguish different kinds of orbital behavior (regular, weakly chaotic, and strong chaotic) giving in parallel the time evolution of the diffusion (see Katsanikas et al. 2013). The maximum diffusion volume and the diffusion speed give us only an indication of the maximum diffusion of the orbits and they have a complementary role.\nBased on the above definitions, we first compute the diffusion speed of the orbit building the double-crescent structure (Fig. 2). In Fig. 18a we give the variation of Vd with time. At the very beginning of the integration, the diffusion volume increases almost monotonically, then it continues increasing fluctuating tending to a value Vd \u2248 13000, up to the point indicated with an arrow. Until that time, the orbit remains sticky to the unstable invariant manifolds of the vLPOs around L1,2, which are guided by the invariant tori around L4,5. For\nlarger time, the consequents depart from the double-crescent structure (corresponding to 190 intersections with the space of section). We observe a characteristic step in the variation of Vd at this point (Fig. 18a). From this point on, the diffusion volume increases further, tending to a value Vmax \u2248 28100, which is reached for Td = 45000. Thus, the diffusion speed of the double-crescent structure is 0.624. The consequents will occupy larger volumes in the phase space as time increases because the system is open (the value of energy is above the value of energy E(L1,2) and the consequents cannot be restricted from the curve zero velocity surface). This results the increasing of diffusion volume versus time.\nThe time evolution of the diffusion volume of the sticky-torusorbit around L4 (Fig. 10) is given in Fig. 18b. The diffusion volume is constant for a large time interval (10000 < t < 45000). Once the consequents depart from the torus region, at the time indicated with an arrow at the right-hand side of Fig. 18b, we observe a small increase of Vd. This small increase will continue forever because the system is open (the value of energy is above the value of the E(L1,2) energy and the consequents cannot be restricted from the curve zero velocity surface). We compute the diffusion speed for this orbit to be ud = 0.001034 (Vmax = 1765 and Td = 1707000).\nThe orbit that gives the clouds in the space of section (Fig.6) is strongly chaotic, but, as long as we integrated it, it remains trapped in a subvolume of the phase space, due to the presence of the invariant tori of the sao\u2019s. In this case, the evolution of the diffusion volume is given in Fig. 18c. The values of the volume level off at about Vd = 8000, but close to the end of the integration, beyond a time indicated with an arrow, there is a small further increase. This increase is due to the few points that slip through the \u201choles\u201d between the tori, reaching larger distances. The consequents occupy a maximum diffusion volume Vd = 9200 at Td = 62000, which gives a diffusion speed ud = 0.14832.\n\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000"

Apart from the case, in which the perturbation of the initial conditions of a PO brings the perturbed orbits on nearby tori of other families, there are several kinds of stickiness, that may keep the orbit confined in the vicinity of a PO for times, dynamically significant in Galactic Dynamics. This may delay the diffusion of the orbit in remote phase space regions, in the same way that the trapping of a chaotic orbit in a restricted volume may even reinforce morphological features observed in disk galaxies (Patsis and Katsanikas 2014a; Patsis et al. 2022).\nBy perturbing the initial conditions of the vLPOs around the Lagrangian points L1,2, we found five types of orbital behaviour:\n(i) Double-crescent, sticky chaotic structures: The first type is represented by double-crescent structures with smooth color variation along their consequents in the 4D spaces of section. This means that they are at least close to a smooth surface in the 4D space. This morphology lasts for long integration times (of the order of a Hubble time). However, the points forming them are sticky\n\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe phase space around L1,2 11\na)\non the unstable invariant manifolds of the simple (or double) unstable POs around the Lagrangian points L1,2. The manifolds are guided from the invariant tori that are found around the stable vertical periodic orbits associated with the Lagrangian points L4,5. For larger integration times the points diffuse away of these structures and occupy larger volumes in the phase space. Thus, eventually, they are chaotic with large diffusion speeds.\n(ii) Clouds: The second orbital type can be described as 4D clouds of points in the 4D spaces of section. The consequents have irregular distribution in the 3D projections and mixing of colors when colored according to their values in the fourth dimension. This is typical of a strong chaotic behavior, as also reflected in the large values of the Lyapunov characteristic numbers (LCN) of these orbits. Nevertheless, their expansion rate is decelerated, by the presence of the invariant tori around the sao POs. This keeps their ud values relatively small.\n(iii) Quasi-periodic orbits on tori: The third type are regular orbits forming tori with smooth color variation along their surfaces. In this case, their LCN tends to zero. These are quasi-periodic orbits around the stable vLPO4 and vLPO5 or around either branch of the sao\u2019s.\n(iv) Sticky tori: The fourth type are the sticky tori. In the 4D spaces of section, these orbits stick on the tori around the stable vLPO4 and vLPO5 for long time. Eventually, these weakly chaotic orbits diffuse in phase space with small diffusion speeds.\n(v) Toroidal zones/structures: Finally, we find the orbits we call toroidal zones or toroidal structures. These are orbits, sticky\non the unstable invariant manifolds of the two simple unstable uao POs, which are guided by the invariant tori around the sao\u2019s. Up to a certain time the consequents of these orbits stay on a quasi-regular toroidal-like zone retaining a smooth color variation along their surface. Then, this weakly chaotic behaviour turns to a strongly chaotic one, with totally irregular distribution of the consequents in the 3D projections, mixing of colors and large positive LCN. They are practically clouds of scattered points in the 4D spaces. Nevertheless, the diffusion of these orbits is small due to the presence of the the sao tori in the region.\nStickiness is ubiquitus in the neighborhood of the simple unstable vLPOs around L1,2. Stickiness in chaos appears typically in orbits sticky to the asymptotic curves of the vLPO1,2 unstable invariant manifolds. They remain close to the tori of the vertical families of POs associated with L4,5. Stickiness in chaos is also found in orbits remaining sticky to the asymptotic curves of the unstable invariant manifolds of the uao POs. In addition we also find sticky orbits to the sao, as well as to the vLPO4 and vLPO5, tori. In conclusion, the presence of the sao tori is very important for restricting the orbital diffusion from the region around the vLPOs.\nA basic, general, conclusion of this study is that the presence of stickiness in the orbital behaviour of the orbits in our 3D Hamiltonian system, hinders the diffusion of chaotic orbits. We find that strongly chaotic orbits, with large LCN, have small diffusion speeds. Such orbits are the clouds and the orbits we called toroidal zones/structures. Contrarily, weakly chaotic orbits like those that\n\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000"

The complexity of the phase space plays a crucial role, since in the vicinity of the POs one can find several invariant structures (tori or manifolds) which in effect delay the diffusion of chaotic orbits.\nThe lack of observed structures away of the equatorial plane at the corotation region in galactic images indicates the absence of families that can act as obstacles for the diffusion of the orbits in the surrounding chaotic sea.
