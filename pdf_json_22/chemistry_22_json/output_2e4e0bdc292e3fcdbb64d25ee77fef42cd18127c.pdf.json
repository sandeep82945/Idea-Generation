    "abstractText": "Designable and ultrathin covalent organic framework nanosheets (CONs) with good photoelectric activity are promising candidates for the construction of photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors for the detection of low-abundance biological substrates. However, achieving highly sensitive PEC properties by using emerging covalent organic framework nanosheets (CONs) remains a great challenge due to the polymeric nature and poor photoelectric activity of CONs. Herein, we report for the first time the preparation of novel composites and their PEC sensing properties by electrostatic self-assembly of ultrathin CONs (called TTPA-CONs) with Ti3C2Tx. The prepared TTPA-CONs/Ti3C2Tx composites can be used as photocathodes for PEC detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with high sensitivity, low detection limit, and good stability. This work not only expands the application of CONs but also opens new avenues for the development of efficient PEC sensing platforms.",

            "text": "The detection of tumor markers is important for early clinical diagnosis of cancer [1\u20133]. Prostate cancer is one of the most common and fatal diseases in humans. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is one of the most reliable cancer markers for early diagnosis of prostate cancer. PSA levels in normal human body serum are below 4 ng mL\u22121. The presence of prostate cancer leads to elevated PSA levels [4]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective methods to achieve sensitive detection of PSA [5\u20138]. To date, many techniques have been used for the quantitative detection of PSA, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electrochemical technique, colorimetric technique, and fluorescence technique [9\u201312], but the complicated operation and unsatisfactory sensitivity of these methods have greatly hindered their wide application. Therefore, it is essential to explore a reliable, simple, rapid, and sensitive method for prostate-specific antigen detection. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing is a new sensing technology that uses a singlewavelength light source assembled with an electrochemical detection device [13,14]. Due to its ease of miniaturization and integration, PEC sensing offers higher sensitivity than conventional electrochemical sensing [15\u201318]. When a beam of light is irradiated on a semiconductor material and its energy is equal to or greater than the semiconductor band gap, electrons can jump from the valence band to the conduction band under the excitation of light and generate holes in the valence band, achieving the effective separation of electrons and holes [19,20]. After the separation of electrons and holes, a photovoltage is generated and a photocurrent is formed in the external circuit [21\u201323]. Using the interaction between the photoelectrode material and the substances, the quantitative analysis of PEC\nMolecules 2022, 27, 6732. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27196732 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 6732 2 of 13\nsensors can be achieved based on the relationship between the change in photocurrent or photovoltage and the concentration of biomarkers [24,25]. In the past few years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as one of the crystalline porous materials built from organic building blocks linked by covalent bonds, have attracted extensive attention due to their ordered structure with tunable functional groups, programmable pore size, and high overall porosity [26\u201330]. COFs can easily be endowed with photoactive properties by incorporating appropriate building blocks and linkages, making it possible to generate COF-based PEC sensors with good structural designation [31]. So far, only several COFs have been proposed in this field, such as D-TA COF film [32], TAPP-COF film [33], F-COF [34], and PAF-130 [35]. However, such PEC sensors are fabricated with bulk COFs and cannot meet the full requirements of certain applications [36]. The long conduction paths between adjacent layers make it difficult for the resulting electron hole pairs to separate quickly, which seriously affects the photoelectric activity. Compared with bulk COFs, two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic framework nanosheets (CONs) have unique properties, including tunable thicknesses down to 1.15 \u00b1 0.1 nm (COF-367), large specific surface area, and highly accessible active sites. In addition, due to their extremely short layer spacing, ultrathin CONs have better photoelectric performance than that of bulk COFs, enabling effective separation of the generated electron\u2013hole pairs. The top-down approach can be used to prepare COF nanosheets. Soft and restorative structures were introduced into COF block for the fabrication of CONs [37,38]. As a type of 2D material composed of transition metals, carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides, MXene possesses excellent electrical conductivity, large surface area, and tunable surface terminal groups, and is widely used in optoelectronic fields such as photocatalysis [39] and PEC sensors [40,41]. Since aluminum (Al) layers are replaced with various functional groups (e.g., -OH, -O, and -F) during etching, MXene can be easily integrated with other highly conductive materials or semiconductors to build composite systems [42,43]. As a semiconductor, the Fermi energy levels and the escape work of CONs and MXene are significantly different. This difference allows the generated electron-hole pairs to separate unidirectionally through the CONs/MXene interface, forming a space charge region that further prevents the passage of electrons or holes in the opposite direction. The composite is constructed to facilitate the separation and transport of electron-hole pairs while inhibiting their recombination, thus greatly improving the optoelectronic properties of the composite. Therefore, we prepared composite sensors by compounding polyethyleneimine (PEI)modified CONs with Ti3C2Tx and applied them to the detection of PSA."

In our work, in order to obtain COF nanosheets directly by a bottom-up approach, we chose N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetrakis(4-aminopheneyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (TAPPDA) and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetrakis(4-formylpheneyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (TFPPDA) with a distorted diarylamino structure to reduce the interlayer stacking of COF. After sonication, the TTPA-CONs were obtained. The as-synthesized TTPA-CONs were then electrostatically self-assembled with the newly synthesized Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (Scheme 1a). Typically, high yields of TTPA-COF were achieved by [4+4] imine condensation of TAPPDA and TFPPDA at a molar ratio of 1:1 in a mixture of o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), using 6 M acetic acid as the catalyst. To improve the yield of CONs, the obtained TTPA-COF was subjected to ultrasonication. Subsequently, the obtained TTPA-CONs were mixed with the freshly obtained Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. After sonication, TTPA-CONs/Ti3C2Tx composites were obtained (see the Materials and Methods section below for details). A typical C=N stretching vibration peak at ~1617 cm\u22121 can be observed in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). In addition, the disappearance of N-H stretching bonds in TAPA (3337 cm\u22121 and 3432 cm\u22121) and the reduction in C=O stretching bonds in TFPA (~1693 cm\u22121)\nMolecules 2022, 27, 6732 3 of 13\nindicate the formation of a Schiff base.

The experimental PXRD patterns of the obtained TTPA-COF match\nwell with the simulated patterns of the crystal model.

After exfoliation, the main peak was extremely weakened and\nshifted to 4.0\u00b0. In addition, a weak and broad peak around 20.0\u00b0 appears, indicating \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\nstacking interaction between the vertically stacked 2D layers and the broadening of the\nlayer distance of TTPA-COF, confirming the successful stripping of TTPA-COF (Figure\n1a).

In addition, the shift of the diffraction peak as-\nsigned to the (002) crystal plane from 9.5\u00b0 to 6.2\u00b0 originates from the removal of the alu-\nminum atomic layer and the intercalation of lithium ions and H2O molecules after etching\nand exfoliation, which also represents the successful acquisition of Ti3C2Tx (Figure S2b).\nScheme 1.

As shown in Figure S8, the photocurrent intensity increased with increasing concentration of TTPA-CONs/Ti3C2Tx in the range of 1 to 3.0 mg L\u22121. When the concentration of TTPA-CONs/Ti3C2Tx was further increased, the photocurrent intensity decreased rapidly, which may be due to the thicker nanocoating hindering electron transfer. Therefore, a TTPA-CONs/Ti3C2Tx concentration of 3.0 mg mL\u22121 was chosen for subsequent experiments. Next, we optimized the pH of the Tris-HCl solution. As shown in Figure S9, the photocurrent intensity gradually increased and then gradually decreased as the pH increased from 6.0 to 7.4, which indicated that the Tris-HCl solution with pH 7.4 was the most favorable for electron transfer, so we chose the solution with pH 7.4 to detect PSA. In addition, the incubation time of the PSA aptamer, BSA, and PSA had important effects on the performance of the PEC sensor. The photocurrent intensity decreased rapidly with increasing incubation time and reached the lowest values at 2.5 h, 50 min, and 120 min, respectively (Figures S10\u2013S12). Subsequently, the photocurrent did not change greatly with the extension of time, so the incubation times for the PSA aptamer, BSA, and PSA were finally determined to be 2.5 h, 50 min, and 120 min, respectively. Since the PSA aptamer can bind to P4, which can directly affect the intensity of the photocurrent, the concentration of the P4 aptamer was optimized in Figure S13. The photocurrent intensity reached the highest value when the concentration of PSA aptamer was 5 \u00b5M.

This can be explained by the fact that a large amount of poorly conducting PSA-aptamer complexes is generated by being trapped on the sensing surface, hindering electron transfer. As shown in Figure 4b, the logarithm of photocurrent intensity and PSA concentration showed a good linear relationship in the range of 0.001 to 10,000 ng/mL.

Prior to modification, the glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) were polished with 0.3 \u00b5m and 0.05 \u00b5m alumina slurry and sonicated in ethanol and ultrapure water. Then, the TTPA-CONs/Ti3C2Tx composites were sonicated in ultrapure water for 1 min to obtain a uniformly distributed suspension with a concentration of 3 mg mL\u22121.

The modified electrodes were defined as the Apt/TTPA-CONs/Ti3C2Tx/GCE electrodes by incubating Aptamer-NH2 (5 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5L) on TTPA-CONs/Ti3C2Tx/GCE for 2.5 h at 4 \u25e6C.

Next, the PSA series solutions with different concentrations were incubated at 4 \u25e6C for 120 min, and then washed for further measurements. PEC experiments were recorded on a CHI760 E electrochemical workstation using a threeelectrode system with modified GCE as working electrode, platinum wire as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode. The photocurrent response was measured in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under visible light irradiation (300 W Xenon lamp) at room temperature without applying bias potential.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 6732 11 of 13"

            "text": "In summary, we herein demonstrated a novel PEC sensor based on composites constructed by electrostatic self-assembly of TTPA-CONs and Ti3C2Tx. The prepared TTPACONs/Ti3C2Tx composites show enhanced photoelectric properties compared with TTPACONs, making them effective candidates for fabricating cathodic PEC sensors. Due to the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, the well-designed PEC sensor exhibits a linear response to PSA in the range of 0.001 to 10,000 ng/mL, with a low detection limit of 0.0003 ng/mL under optimal conditions. It is believed that this work may pave the way toward the design of high-performance PEC sensing platforms and broaden the application of CONs in biomimetic sensing and analysis.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27196732/s1.
