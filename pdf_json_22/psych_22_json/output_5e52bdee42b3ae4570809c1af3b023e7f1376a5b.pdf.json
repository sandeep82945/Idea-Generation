    "abstractText": "Authoritarian parenting has long been associated with Western individualism and improved child development. This study examined the relationship between cultural values, parenting styles, and children\u2019s perceived competence in Hong Kong. A total of 48 parents from local Chinese families, 49 parents from South Asian families, and 105 children (24 local Chinese and 81 South Asian) aged 5\u20136 years participated in the study. Self-report questionnaires on adherence to Asian cultural values and parenting style were administered to parents. The Pictorial Survey on Children\u2019s Perceived Competence was administered to children by trained research assistants. The results contradicted two longstanding assumptions on Asian cultural values and parenting styles. First, higher adherence to Asian cultural values increased the likelihood of having an authoritarian parenting style. Second, authoritative parenting practices were more likely be associated with improved social\u2013emotional competence in children. Multiple regression analyzes revealed a strong positive correlation between Asian cultural values and authoritative parenting style (R = 0.597). There was no association between parenting style and the development of competence in young children. However, a positive correlation was found between Asian cultural values and young children\u2019s perceived competence. This study showed that components of collectivism and humility in Asian cultural values could have functional values that are essential for developing competencies in South Asian young children but not in local Chinese young children. This study discussed the implications of cultural values sin the terms of contextualization, functional relevance of cultural values for ethnic minorities, and ideal parenting practices.",

This study examined the relationship between\ncultural values, parenting styles, and children\u2019s perceived competence in Hong\nKong. A total of 48 parents from local Chinese families, 49 parents from South\nAsian families, and 105 children (24 local Chinese and 81 South Asian) aged\n5\u20136 years participated in the study. Self-report questionnaires on adherence\nto Asian cultural values and parenting style were administered to parents.\nThe Pictorial Survey on Children\u2019s Perceived Competence was administered\nto children by trained research assistants. The results contradicted two long-\nstanding assumptions on Asian cultural values and parenting styles. First,\nhigher adherence to Asian cultural values increased the likelihood of having\nan authoritarian parenting style. Second, authoritative parenting practices\nwere more likely be\u00a0associated with improved social\u2013emotional competence\nin children. Multiple regression analyzes revealed a strong positive correlation between Asian cultural values and authoritative parenting style (R2 = 0.597).\nThere was no association between parenting style and the development of\ncompetence in young children. However, a positive correlation was found\nbetween Asian cultural values and young children\u2019s perceived competence.\nThis study showed that components of collectivism and humility in Asian\ncultural values could have functional values that are essential for developing\ncompetencies in South Asian young children but not in\u00a0local Chinese young\nchildren.

            "text": "In recent decades, the ethnic diversity in Hong Kong has expanded (Fleming, 2019). In 2016, Hong Kong had a population of approximately 7.34 million, including 8% of the population that is non-Chinese compared to the 6% of non-Chinese in 2011 (Census and Statistics Department, 2011, 2016). South Asian ethnic groups, such as Indonesians, Nepalese, Pakistanis, and Filipinos, comprised 71% of the non-ethnic Chinese population in Hong Kong (Census and Statistics Department, 2016). South Asians and local Hong Kong citizens are categorized as Asians and assumed to have a collectivist cultural orientation (Fleming, 2019). However, there are variations in the different cultural sub-groups across the broader Asian cultures, which are reflected in every aspect of life, including parenting practices.\nBronfenbrenner\u2019s (1979) ecological systems model of development proposes that an individual is nested within interrelated social systems at different levels, ranging from the micro level, (referring to the cultural context in the home) to the macro level (the broader socio-cultural context). Childrearing is inevitably affected by the occurrences within these social levels and vice versa (Bronfenbrenner, 1986). Parenting comprises various practices that reflect the cultural values within a child\u2019s home that could differ from the broader local culture in which they live (Bornstein, 2012; Hosken et\u00a0al., 2019).\nAcculturation theory contends that the smooth transition across contexts and positive acculturation with the host culture is required among immigrants (Berry, 1980; Barker and Cornwell, 2019). The smooth transition across contexts is indicative of having knowledge of the social expectations of the involved contexts and behaving in accordance to these expectations (Schwartz et\u00a0al., 2010; Li, 2013). Given this, an individual may engage himself or herself in forced adaptation, not yet positive acculturation, in order to obtain smooth transitions. Acculturation theory suggests that forced adaptation and positive acculturation represent two ends of a continuum (Berry, 1980; Barker, 2015). New immigrants frequently engage in \u201cforced\u201d adaptation wherein they conform to local cultural values at the early stage of the adaptation process where as positive acculturation refers when individuals can achieve a balance between host (macro-level) and home (micro-level) cultural values in which they exercise these values appropriately and adaptively without devaluing either of the cultural values (Schwartz et\u00a0al., 2010). In other words, positive acculturated individuals can exercise more than one set of cultural values over time and within or across contexts in daily living smoothly and competently. Considering this, exploring the dynamics between Asian cultural values on parenting behaviors would provide insights into the heterogeneity of Asian cultural values in Asian sub-cultural groups and their relationship to parental behaviors, which in turn influence children\u2019s perceived competence.\nCultural studies have identified six key elements typically associated with an authoritarian parenting style that most Asian ethnic groups having a collectivist cultural orientation share\n(Kim et\u00a0al., 1999; Ng and Wang., 2019). These elements are: (1) conformity to social norms (i.e., recognition and adherence to social expectations, norms, and practices); (2) family recognition through achievements (i.e., a reflection of an individual\u2019s achievements and family status); (3) emotional self-control (i.e., behaving appropriately rather than acting on how one is feeling); (4) collectivism (i.e., placing group welfare before individual welfare); (5) humility (i.e., being humble without boasting about one\u2019s achievement); and (6) filial piety (i.e., being respectful toward one\u2019s living parents, ascertaining the rules of culturally defined intergenerational relationships, and placing familial needs before individual interests). Among the four parenting styles proposed by Diana Baumrind (1978), the authoritarian parenting style is characterized by high control and low warmth in which parents employ strict discipline, are insensitive to the child\u2019s emotional needs (Ang and Goh, 2006). Parenting behaviors of this style include expectations of obedience and compliance to parental demands with less responsiveness toward their children\u2019s needs (Rudy and Grusec, 2006). Existing research suggests that parents in Asian societies generally demand high obedience levels from their children and interact with family and community members through rules and orders based on social hierarchy (Rudy and Grusec, 2006; Dwairy and Achoui, 2010). On the other hand, while permissive parenting style cares about their children\u2019s needs but have difficulty setting limits in children\u2019s disciplines, the authoritative parenting style is characterized by high control and high warmth with high parental affection and responsivity to children\u2019s needs as well as high expectations with increased independence and self-control (Rudy and Grusec, 2006). These characteristics are generally reflected individualism-oriented culture which is characterized by open discussions and interpersonal equality dominating the Western culture (Rudy and Grusec, 2006). It is considered the ideal parenting style to raise competent children, whereas the authoritarian style is more likely to raise less competent children (Sorkhabi, 2005; Xu et\u00a0al., 2005; Chen-Bouck et\u00a0al., 2019).\nChao (1994) explained the discrepancies between Western and Chinese cultures in their understanding of \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201clove.\u201d Particularly, the meaning of \u201cguan\u201d (to control) in the Chinese culture includes the meaning of responsiveness to children\u2019s needs has been misinterpreted by non-ethnic Chinese cultural groups. \u201cGuan\u201d means \u201cto govern\u201d but also means \u201cto care for and to love.\u201d Components of love and responsiveness are embedded in the notion of \u201ccontrol\u201d in Chinese parenting. The underlying meaning of \u201ccontrol\u201d for them is to protect children from harm and help them succeed (Ang and Goh, 2006; Mousavi and Juhari, 2019). Therefore, Chinese parents, view \u201ccontrol\u201d as an act of parental love, care, involvement, concern, and support for children\u2019s needs rather than the negative connotations suggested in existing family studies (Chao, 1994; Sorkhabi, 2005; Xu et\u00a0al., 2005).\nOther studies on the association between parenting style and children\u2019s positive outcomes highlighted the need to contextualize cultural values with consideration of children\u2019s developmental\nYim 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905093\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nstage, engaged cultural contexts and meanings to the families and their children (Alegre, 2011; Huang and Gove, 2015; Hung, 2018; Olla et\u00a0al., 2018). Studies demonstrated that Chinese youth living in authoritarian families performed better in school than those in authoritative families (Alegre, 2011; Hung, 2018). Other studies have investigated the association between authoritarian parenting in Asian families and their children\u2019s development (Huang and Gove, 2015; Hung, 2018; Olla et\u00a0al., 2018). These studies suggested that parents had their own values and expectations about how they, as parents, should behave to raise competent children. Many of these parents described competence in terms of academic achievement (Huang and Gove, 2015; Hung, 2018; Olla et\u00a0al., 2018). On the other hand, studies on authoritative parenting behaviors found that these behaviors significantly contributed to improved school grades for non-Chinese, European-Americans youths, and school-aged children more than the first-generation Chinese youth and school-aged children (Pong et\u00a0 al., 2010; Antony-Newman, 2019). These findings suggested that the characteristics of authoritative parenting may not exert the same effects on families from different cultural backgrounds. Adolescents and young children are at different developmental stages. Adolescents experience more academic pressure for school achievement than young children, while young children experience challenges related to socio-emotional development such as acceptance from others, including parents, caregivers, and peers. Besides focusing on academic achievements and decontextualizing the interpretations of Asian cultural values, the existing studies focus on the influence of Asian cultural values on parenting while targeting Asian families with adolescents in different countries instead of young children from different sub-cultural group in the same geographic region (Chao, 2001; Pong et\u00a0al., 2005; Shoshani and Steinmetz, 2014) and measuring developmental outcomes in adolescents in terms of academic achievement (Chao and Kaeochinda, 2010; Lin et\u00a0al., 2021). Thus, assessments of young children\u2019s development should focus on social\u2013emotional development such as perceived self-competence in daily life which is affected by the children\u2019s involved social systems (Brock et\u00a0al., 1998; Huber et\u00a0al., 2019).\nBronfenbrenner\u2019s ecological and bioecological model of development provides a theoretical framework that describes the interconnectedness across five major social systems and their influence on personal development from an individual, societal, and organizational level (Bronfenbrenner, 1986; Bronfenbrenner and Morris, 1998). These five systems include: (1) the microsystem, which is the context that is closest to an individual\u2019s life with the most direct interactions (e.g., family, school, religious institutions, neighborhood, and peers); (2) the mesosystem, referring to the interconnections between the different elements in an individual\u2019s microsystems, (e.g., interactions between the family and school or children\u2019s peers and the family); (3) the exosystem, representing the links between social settings in which an individual is not actively involved (e.g., a child\u2019s experience at home may be\u00a0 influenced by parental experiences at work, subsequently affecting parent\u2013child interactions); (4) the macrosystem,\ncomprising the overarching societal culture (e.g., socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and laws and rules binding individuals); and (5) the chronosystem, which refers to how the person and environments change over time (Christensen, 2016; Xia et\u00a0al., 2020). According to this model, instead of living within five separate social systems, individuals are nested within the five social systems that are embedded within one another. The five social systems are embedded such that individuals are affected by the progressively complex reciprocal interactions between an individual and his or her environment regularly over extended periods (Xia et\u00a0 al., 2020). The model was later enhanced by introducing Process\u2013Person\u2013Context\u2013Time Model (PPCT) to highlight on the important role of time and developmental needs across the life span on an individual development (Bronfenbrenner, 1992; Xia et\u00a0al., 2020).\nProximal processes (Process) are the reciprocal interactions between a developing human being and one or more of the persons, objects, and symbols in his or her immediate environment (Bronfenbrenner, 1992). These reciprocal interactions are expected to become \u201cprogressively more complex\u201d with the expanded social network and more complicated life events (Bronfenbrenner and Morris, 1998). Person characteristics include personality traits that can foster or sustain proximal processes, or interfere with or prevent their occurrence. The sustainability of the proximal process can be\u00a0further supported by those biological, mental, or experiential resources, such as physical attributes, and reading abilities, that individuals bring to the development process. Contextual demands that may pose barriers to the development and proximal processes in the individuals vary from time to time, such as the difficulties of tasks and whether the demands posed on the individual are beyond the individual\u2019s capabilities and resources available at the time. Context refers to the socio-cultural environment, including digital world where the individual engages. Johnson and Puplampu (2008) proposed an ecological techno-subsystem highlighting the significant impacts of the availability of technologies in an individual\u2019s microsystem that could bring socio-cultural influences from virtual contexts in which the individual is not currently physically engaged. In other words, individuals are exposed to multiple cultures and norms rather than being confined to a single culture or norm (Johnson and Puplampu, 2008; Schwartz et\u00a0al., 2010). Regarding the last component of Time, the model suggested that development and reciprocal interaction can occur within a shorter period during a proximal process (microtime) or span over a longer period of days to months (mesotime) or decades within and across generations (macrotime; Bronfenbrenner, 1986; Bronfenbrenner and Morris, 1998).\nWhile the refined bioecological model with the PCCT model and ecological techno-subsystem provided a general overview of how different factors could synergistically impact human development over extended periods, it fails to explain how an individual is affected by the socio-cultural context it is engaged in at a specific developmental stage. In some stages of development, some factors may exert more influence on the individual\u2019s\nYim 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905093\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\ndevelopment than the others. Different competence weighs differently in the different developmental stages. In childhood, the socio-emotional competence is considered more important than academic related competences, which are weighted heavier in school-aged and later stages of development. In this study, young children of 5 years old who are in the early stage of development (Time) and they primarily engage themselves in home and school (Context). Young children generally spend considerable less amount of time on internet than older children (Hinkley et\u00a0al., 2012; Fakhouri et\u00a0al., 2013). The reciprocal interactions between the children (Person) and their major caregiver (s) are the major proximal processes (Process) to be\u00a0measured.\nReview of the existing research investigating associations between parenting styles and cultural values have the following limitations. First, the existing literature investigating the parenting styles of Asian sub-cultural groups mainly compared families of inter-Asian countries (Ang and Goh, 2006; Chuang et\u00a0al., 2018). Second, studies investigating the effects of parenting styles on children\u2019s development mainly focus on adolescents or school-aged children than preschoolers as study samples with research emphasis on academic-related skills for school readiness rather than their socio-emotional development (Wong et\u00a0 al., 2018; Xia, 2020). Third, although there are studies on Hong Kong-Chinese and sub-Asian children in Hong Kong, these studies focus on parental expectations and satisfaction instead of the effects of their parenting on the socio-emotional development of young children (Chan et\u00a0al., 2009; Chan and Li, 2020; Lau and Power, 2020). The limitations in the existing literature suggest a need to explore the differences in parenting practices among Asian sub-cultural groups in within the same geographical region like Hong Kong (Chuang et\u00a0al., 2018). Hong Kong, previously a British colony, has its Chinese cultural origins that can be\u00a0 discerned along with influence of the Western cultures. Interpretations of Asian cultural values among local Hong Kong residents are not equivalent to those who immigrated to Hong Kong from neighboring Asian countries (Hue and Kennedy, 2014). With an increasing number of South Asian families are migrating to Hong Kong with young children., the intergroup differences between local Chinese and South Asian cultural groups must be\u00a0 investigated to understand how adherence to Asian cultural values contributes toward parenting styles and the influence of parenting style on children\u2019s development within these groups (Yuen, 2016). The study investigates the extent to which these sub-cultural groups adhere to Asian cultural values and how these values were related to their choice of parenting practices which in turn contribute to children\u2019s well-being. This study aimed to investigate (1) the intergroup differences between local Chinese parents and South Asian parents in their adherence to Asian cultural values and their parenting style; (2) the relationship between Asian cultural values and parenting styles; (3) the dynamics between the specific components of Asian cultural values and young children\u2019s perceived competence; and (4) relationship between parenting style and children\u2019s perceived competence."

One kindergarten school had over 90% South Asian children and 10%, local Chinese children, while the second one had 50% South Asians and 50% local Chinese children, and the third had 90% local Chinese children with 10% South Asian children. The South Asian ethnic groups included Indonesians (33%), Nepalese (11%), Pakistanis (34%), and Filipinos (22%). Due to the limited sample size of South Asian samples, this study used South Asian as the collective term for the South Asian ethnic groups and local Chinese for Hong Kong local ethnic group.\nAccording to the school principals and teachers of participating schools, the South Asian parents had settled in Hong Kong for over 5 years and could read and speak English, with their children being born and raised in Hong Kong. No formal assessment was administered to determine children\u2019s language proficiency in Cantonese. These South Asian children started their full-day schooling in the participating schools when they were 3 years old. After 2 years of schooling in\u00a0local kindergartens, these children were proficient in Cantonese for daily communication. Major caregivers for the children were invited to participate in the study.

The scale was with 62-items scored on a fivepoint rating scale (1 = never; 5 = always) to assess parents\u2019 adherence to three major parenting styles: authoritative (27 items), authoritarian (20 items), and permissive (15 items). This questionnaire excluded items related to the rejecting/neglecting parenting style based on the assumption that participating parents consented to participate in the study willingly and were actively involved in their children\u2019s activities (Robinson et\u00a0al., 1995). The scale has been tested in various countries (Utah, Canada, Iran and Italy) with good reliability and validity (Robinson et\u00a0al., 1996; Maria et\u00a0al., 2013; Delvecchio et\u00a0al., 2020; Mojdehi et\u00a0al., 2020). Example items in the questionnaire include: \u201cI praise my child when he/she is good\u201d; \u201cI argue with my child;\u201d \u201cI use threats such as punishment with little or no justification\u201d (Robinson et\u00a0al., 1995).\nPictorial scale of perceived competence and acceptance for young children preschool-kindergarten (male and female versions)\nThe PSPCSA was used to assess children\u2019s perceived competence. Harter and Pike (1984) developed the 24-item scale with pictures covering the domains of cognitive competence (six items), physical competence (six items), peer acceptance (six items), and maternal acceptance (6 items). The scale has been tested in various countries showing good reliability and validity (Fantuzzo et\u00a0al., 1996; Venetsano et\u00a0al., 2018; Heritage et\u00a0al., 2020). Each item has two pictures: one image represents a child who can perform the task, and the second image denotes a child who cannot perform the same task. Children are asked to indicate the picture that was the closest or most similar to them when performing the illustrated task. If the picture with a capable child is selected, the children are asked to indicate the extent of similarity between the two choices. Examples of items in the survey include: \u201cThis girl is not very good at counting. Are you?\u201d; \u201cThe boy is not very good at climbing. Are you?\u201d (Harter and Pike, 1984). Children are asked to make a judgment about the level of similarity between the illustrated picture and their self-perception on the same task."

For the Asian Values Scale, the Cronbach\u2019s alphas for subscale family recognition through achievement, collectivism, and humility were 0.772, 0.688, and 0.649, respectively. The internal consistencies of subscale conformity to norms, emotional self-control and filial piety were low, with 0.454, 0.401, and 0.307, respectively.

The regression models of South Asian parents and the other two parenting styles, namely authoritarian (R2 = 0.145)\nYim 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905093\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nand permissive (R2 = 0.268) failed to obtain satisfactory R2 scores, indicating the absence of a meaningful relationship between these two parenting styles and Asian cultural values. For local-Chinese parents, no regression models had higher R2 scores, as there were no meaningful relationships between any form of parenting style and their Asian cultural values. Regarding the influences of Asian cultural values on parenting style adoption, in South Asian parent group, authoritative parenting style had stronger positive correlation with humility (\u03b2 = 0.490) than collectivism (\u03b2 = 0.121). Authoritarian parenting style had negative correlation with collectivism (\u03b2 = \u22120.205). Permissive parenting style had very weak negative correlations with the measured values including achievement (\u03b2 = \u22120.134), humility (\u03b2 = \u22120.027) and collectivism (\u03b2 = \u22120.001). For local Chinese parents, authoritative parenting style had negative correlation with achievement (\u03b2 = \u22120.316) whereas had the weakest correlation with humility (\u03b2 = 0.013). Authoritarian parenting style had positive correlations with achievement (\u03b2 = 0.315) and collectivism (\u03b2 = 0.162). Permissive parenting style had weak correlations with measured values including achievement (\u03b2 = 0.266), humility (\u03b2 = \u22120.143) and collectivism (\u03b2 = 0.092) (Tables 1\u20133).\nAsian cultural values on children\u2019s perceived competence\nThe correlation between Asian cultural values and perceived competence among children from local Chinese\nparents was significantly stronger than among South Asian parents. Specifically, the association between Asian cultural values and peer competence (R2 = 0.643) was significantly stronger among local Chinese than their South Asian counterparts (R2 = 0.097).\nThis study shows that all six domains of Asian cultural values were positively related to the four aspects (cognitive, physical, peer, and maternal competence) of children\u2019s competence in both groups. For the local Chinese group, collectivism (\u03b2 = 0.848) and humility (\u03b2 = \u22120.838) have the strongest correlation with peer competence. A similar magnitude of these two values was also found in its strong correlation with maternal competence (collectivism \u03b2 = 0.624; humility \u03b2 = \u22120.758). For the South Asian group, cognitive competence and collectivism (\u03b2 = \u22120.324) had stronger correlations with the physical competence of children\u2019s perceived competence (Tables 4\u20136).\nRelationship between parenting style and children\u2019s perceived competence\nThe three parenting styles were not associated with children\u2019s perceived competence in both groups. The regression models on parenting style and children\u2019s perceived self-competence were low (R2 < 0.5; Table\u00a07).\nFrom the table above, all the parenting style models affecting children\u2019s perceived competence were lower than 0.5, indicating the lack of a relationship between them.

Conversely, local Chinese do not have the pressure to accommodate to the host culture, and the functional values of Asian cultural values in meeting their children\u2019s well-being are less incentivizing than their non-local counterparts. Finally, unlike the traditional beliefs of permissive indulgent parents who care about their children\u2019s needs but have difficulty setting limits in children\u2019s disciplines, the weak correlations Asian cultural values between and permissive parenting style in in both groups suggested that the characteristics of permissive parenting style had no alignment with Asian cultural values that are characterized with social order and hierarchy (Xu et\u00a0al., 2005; Mojdehi et\u00a0al., 2020)."

            "text": "The relationship between authoritarian parenting style and the Asian cultural value of achievement (family recognition through achievement) was stronger than the other Asian cultural values\nin\u00a0local Chinese parents, despite considerably less adhering to Asian cultural values, in our study. The finding suggested that the local Chinese parents may take authoritarian parenting behaviors as functional means to achieve their expectations on children\u2019s achievement. The higher fidelity to the plans, the more control and monitoring would be\u00a0 needed, the more likely the expected outcomes can be\u00a0achieved. If parents would like the child to obtain achievement to certain level, the closer the child follow their parents\u2019 plans, the more likely the child can achieve the expected level of achievement (Huang and Gove, 2015).\nSimilarly, local Chinese parents with permissive parenting style demonstrated a comparably higher positive correlation with achievement than the other cultural values. This result suggested that parents with indulgent parenting behaviors have expectation in children\u2019s achievement which implies these parents believe that indulgent parenting behaviors could be\u00a0an optimal parenting style for their families and their children. A number of studies on indulgent parenting style suggested that its chances to bring positive developmental outcomes in children could be\u00a0no less than authoritative (Chen et al., 2000; Garc\u00eda and Gracia, 2014). Children raised with permissive parenting experienced less nervousness and could learn competent attitudes and behaviors from social behaviors of their parents (Garcia et\u00a0al., 2021).\nRegarding the role of achievement played in parents with authoritative parenting style, the moderate negative correlation between this style and achievement indicates that parents who expressed warmth and were sensitive to their children\u2019s needs were less likely to consider achievement more important than other Asian cultural values such as collectivism and humility. These parents are could more timely knowledge and understanding about the priority needs at early years development. Moral and character development could be\u00a0considered as more important\nYim 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905093\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org\nvalues than achievement for parents with authoritative parenting styles (Huang and Gove, 2015; Hung, 2018).\nComponents of Asian cultural values and parenting styles\nA closer examination a closer examination of the association of specific components of Asian cultural values on parenting style shows that collectivism and humility contributed to authoritative parenting behaviors in South Asian families. From a cultural and pragmatic perspective, collectivism and humility are not merely values cherished by Asian families but are also recognized as protective factors for the survival and well-being of ethnic minorities in the local cultural context (Ang and Goh, 2006). In a collectivist society, a clear social order, interdependence, and mutual good are emphasized and considered essential for maintaining social harmony (Rudy and Grusec, 2001). Collectivism provides spiritual, physical, social, and emotional support to community members amid adversities, which is critical for ethnic minorities (Sorkhabi, 2005). Collectivistic behavior provides children with strong spiritual resources, protects them from harm, and promotes their well-being in the mainstream culture (Rudy and Grusec, 2001; Lansford, 2021). Moreover, parents with more humility than others are likely to recognize their limitations, become aware of their strengths, encourage their children to acknowledge their needs, and identify themselves without devaluing their home values. According to cultural studies on adaptation and well-being, forced assimilation can be\u00a0detrimental to individual well-being as people who experience enforced cultural assimilation tend to devalue their cultural background and family values to integrate into the dominant culture (Berry, 1980; Liu et\u00a0 al., 2009; Barker, 2015). Such devaluation can be\u00a0predominantly seen among children who have a high need for acceptance and peer relationships during childhood because children\u2019s experiences and sense of achievement tend to be\u00a0social, as opposed to adolescents who are academically oriented (Seligman, 2011; Barker, 2015). The perceived notion of the association between Asian cultural values and authoritarian parenting style or less desirable parenting practices must be\u00a0re-visited and re-examined from the perspective of the significance of cultural values for the betterment of individuals\u2019 well-being (Xu et\u00a0al., 2005).\nComponents of Asian cultural values and children\u2019s perceived competence\nThis study found that all the three measured domains of Asian cultural values were positively related to all four aspects of children\u2019s competence that were measured in this study. However, the specific Asian cultural values contributing to the specific aspects of competence varied between South Asian and local Chinese groups."

            "heading": "Collectivism",
            "text": "For the South Asian group, collectivism had negative correlations with physical competence, and peer competence, weak negative correlation with cognitive competence, and non-significant association with maternal competence. This suggests that the value of interdependency for collectivism could negatively affect children\u2019s school-related competence. In contrast, collectivism had significantly stronger positive correlations with physical competence, peer competence, and maternal competence, and non-significant association with cognitive competence in the local Chinese group than their South Asian counterparts. Such findings can be\u00a0 explained by the functional meaning of collectivism in practice in these two groups. South Asian children are an ethnic minority in the local population. Group-oriented practices among members of a minority group may highlight their \u201cdifferences\u201d and pose an obstacle to their accommodation and integration process. Practicing group cohesiveness and prioritization of the group over the individual goals or needs may not be\u00a0an optimal integration strategy for a minority group to adapt and integrate into the mainstream (Barker, 2015). Hence, to facilitate the accommodation and integration process, children of the minority group may tend to their needs to adapt to the host culture. Furthermore, they may develop a feeling of belonging to the mainstream group by being behaviorally and cognitively more similar to their mainstream peers.\nIn contrast, collectivism in the local Chinese group would positively contribute to children\u2019s competence could be\u00a0attributed to the identity of being a member of mainstream group (Rhee et\u00a0al., 1995). Being mainstreamers would bring a strong sense of security to the communities. Mainstream values and practices are commonly considered the standard of societal expectations about how an individual should behave in society (Barker and Cornwell, 2019). Children with group-oriented identities and practices contribute to their competence of interacting with peers in everyday physical and cognitive interaction. The higher the group identity as mainstreamers, the more likely the individual would be\u00a0accepted by the society, including his or her major caregivers (maternal competence in this study). When collectivism could lead to high social-related competence, including peer and maternal competence, group goal and achievement could be\u00a0more important than individual achievement in the local Chinese group where mainstream values are exemplified as a group."

            "heading": "Achievement",
            "text": "South Asian and local Chinese groups could have different interpretations on family recognition through achievement (achievement). For South Asian parents, achievement was associated with children\u2019s physical competence but it had very weak associations with the rest of the children\u2019s competence. Physical development and capabilities are considered as more important than socio-emotional related development in South Asian group which can be\u00a0attributed to their disadvantaged living environment (Huang et\u00a0al., 2012). The environment commonly associated with poor hygiene and crimes (Nguyet and Leung,\nYim 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905093\nFrontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org\n2014). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume these families are more likely to take pride if their children are able to grow up with both physical and mentally resilient strengths. On the other hand, for local Chinese group, achievement had negative relationships with maternal acceptance and peer competence than other competences suggested that local Chinese parents valued socio-emotional related competence more than achievement which traditionally referred to academic achievement. In recent years, the importance of holistic development in young children has been widely promoted in public education delivered through parent education programs at schools, community health clinics, and media channels (Ng et al., 2020). With more voices shared in public media asking for non-competitive curriculum and learning environment, local Chinese parents have developed high awareness about the non-academic needs in nurturing competent children (Ng et al., 2020)."

            "text": "For the South Asian group, humility had a moderate negative association with maternal competence and very weak associations with the rest of the measured children\u2019s competence. On the contrary, humility was found to have very strong negative correlations with peer competence, maternal competence, and positive correlation with cognitive competence but had a weak correlation with physical competence in the local Chinse group. The phenomenon can be\u00a0explained by the functional meaning of humility in these two groups. Humility in Confucian doctrine is interpreted as being humble, tolerant and unostentatious without boasting about one\u2019s achievement (Shek, 2006; Chuang et\u00a0 al., 2018). For South Asian group, parents may take pride of their children\u2019s achievement to promote the recognition by the mainstreamers and enhance the social status as member of ethnic minorities (Nguyet and Leung, 2014).\nFor both groups, the value of humility could impose different functions to the groups. For South Asian groups who are living in disadvantageous living environment, children being tolerate without showing off one\u2019s strengths, both intellectual and physical strengths, could put their children at the risk of bullying (Nguyet and Leung, 2014). For ethnic minorities residing in a local population while socializing in more than one cultures (home and host), survival and adaptation in these social contexts are needed for smoother transition across contexts (Bronfenbrenner and Morris, 1998). It does not necessarily mean South Asian group does not value humility in raising their children. Rather, humility could be\u00a0applied to various extent depending on the needs of these families in contexts (Nguyet and Leung, 2014). Similarly, the strong negative association between humility, children\u2019s peer competence and maternal competence in\u00a0local Chinese group does not necessarily mean local Chinese parents do not value humility in children nurturance. The traditional expectation for the humility in collectivist context may imply hindering one\u2019s strengths and even uniqueness (Chan et\u00a0 al., 2009). A more adaptable application humility that value both humility and\nindividual uniqueness would help strike the balance between the two emphasis. Such application would require the individuals to analyze and reflect (cognitive competence) on the needs and appropriateness in accordance to the social norm of their engaged context (Ang et\u00a0al., 2007).\nRelationship between parenting style and children\u2019s perceived competence\nThe null relationship between parenting style and children\u2019s perceived competence suggests that parenting style does not lead to more competent children. Ideal parenting practices should be\u00a0interpreted from within meaningful contexts. With reference to PPCT model, South Asian parents\u2019 parenting practices that allow children to take pride in their homes\u2019 cultural values and uniqueness while being aware of adjusting and adapting to their host culture, are likely to promote easier transition between social contexts with multiple norms (Bronfenbrenner and Morris, 1998). No individual is exposed solely to a single culture or norm. Social norms are dynamic, varying across social contexts and between people (Johnson and Puplampu, 2008). Parents must nurture children with skills and competencies to respond to the everchanging social norms (Schwartz et\u00a0al., 2010). Therefore, ideal parenting practices are behaviors responsive to changes that emerge in various contexts and enable children to be\u00a0open and flexible to embrace diversity at home, in school, and within their community (Xu et\u00a0al., 2005)."

            "text": "The three important implications of this study include, contextualization of cultural values, the functional value of cultural norms in parenting practices, and reconceptualization of ideal parenting styles.\nContextualization of cultural values for Asian sub-cultural groups\nAsian cultural value is a generic and inclusive term that homogenizes the complexity and intergroup diversity among various sub-cultural groups in any Asian city. The study\u2019s findings provide deeper insights into typical Asian cultural values that have long been literally interpreted and associated with negative connotations in the Western literature, specifically in the context of involved culture and familial needs (Chan et\u00a0al., 2009; Wong et\u00a0al., 2018). The motives underlying values such as obedience, collectivism, and social hierarchy, exercised by South Asian parents, aim at smoother cultural accommodation and meaning of love, which is responsive to children\u2019s needs rather than blindly exercising control over the dependents. Values in cultures have different meanings and perform varied functions for different goals to meet developmental needs in different immediate social contexts across one\u2019s lifespan. Further research is required to\nYim 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905093\nFrontiers in Psychology 16 frontiersin.org\nexamine the meaning, role, and functions of Asian cultural values at different stages of people\u2019s lives in Asian sub-cultural groups.\nPragmatism of Asian cultural values for ethnic minorities\nCultural studies claim that an ideal integration is acculturation (Barker, 2015). Acculturation attenuates individuals\u2019 pressure of adjusting to a new cultural environment and enables them to maintain and value their homes\u2019 cultural values while positively integrating into the new culture such that smooth transition between social contexts can be\u00a0promoted (Barker, 2015). A positive cultural integration process allows for maintaining cultural integrity alongside participation in the host cultural context (Yuen, 2016). In this study, the pragmatic value of collectivism and humility have higher tempting values for adoption and adherence for vulnerable people, i.e., those who are subject to social exclusion and are under pressure for social adaptation or acceptance. The study\u2019s results can alert clinical researchers in family studies and family counseling practitioners to help ethnic minorities who blindly assimilate the host culture\u2019s values. They should be\u00a0 helped in a caring and responsive way to increase their awareness of their needs and uniqueness. Parents of ethnic minorities should also be\u00a0helped to nurture young children with attitudes, skills and resilient strength that enable them to face cultural clashes, be\u00a0flexible and open to multi-cultural or norm acculturation in the broader cultural context is essential for the well-being of all community members, both ethnic minorities and local population (Stamkou et al., 2019)."

The study reiterates to clinical researchers in family studies and family counseling practitioners that authoritarian parenting style, as well as other so called less ideal parenting styles, is not necessarily associated with negative outcomes in children. In addition, awareness and competence in applying culturally sensitive intervention strategies are critical to improving service quality and appropriateness for families from diverse backgrounds."

First, the questionnaires for adherence to Asian cultural values and parenting practices were selfreported, and participating parents rated their parenting style based on the host cultural norms. Second, due to the caregivers in families with lower socioeconomic status are mothers, the gender of caregivers has not been investigated in this study. With the unitary gender type of the participating caretakers, the gender of the child was not included in this study as the exploration on dynamic between both genders of caretakers and children could be\u00a0 very\nlimited. Third, this study did not investigate the relationships between indulgent-neglectful parenting styles on child development as parents with this parenting style paid the least effort to understand children\u2019s needs and set limits in children\u2019s behaviors. Investigations on the influences of these parents on their children development could be\u00a0 very limited. Fourth, the difference in the number of children in South Asian and local Chinese group could post limitation on findings generalization. Finally, although existing cultural research suggested that Asian cultural values and practices have been highly influenced by Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism (Vuong et\u00a0al., 2018, 2020), this study did not explore the relationships between these doctrines and the values held by the members of each participating ethnic group for the following reason. Apart from local Chinese, since the South Asian participants in this study were collectively called \u201cSouth Asian\u201d without differentiating each ethnic group due to limited sample size with uneven ethnic group distribution and limited statistical power, the investigation on the influences of the three doctrines on participants\u2019 cultural values and parenting behaviors could be\u00a0very limited.\nConsidering the above limitations, future research is suggested to explore the role of Asian cultural values adherence in fathers on parenting style and children\u2019s development. Also, in view of diverse ethnicities among Asian, particularly South Asian, population, future research could enhance the statistical power by expanding sample size with more balanced ethnic make up in the sample and investigating the relationship between each specific component of cultural values, including the three doctrines, parenting behaviors in each ethnic group with its unique socio-cultural history to explore the influences of cultural values in parenting practices of different Asian ethnic groups on children development. After all, although the present study with collected quantitative data can be\u00a0improved and supplemented by interviewing parents, conducting on-site observations of children\u2019s social behaviors, expanding the sample size of both South Asian and local Chinese group, and enhancing the differentiation of different cultural groups among the participants, our results have invaluable reference values and provide pioneer insights in exploring contextualization of parenting styles for different ethnic groups within a geographical region rather than across countries and valuable reference for future research on parenting amid cultural diversities."
