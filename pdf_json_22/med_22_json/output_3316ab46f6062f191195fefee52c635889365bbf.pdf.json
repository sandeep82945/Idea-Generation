    "abstractText": "Previous estimates determined prevalence of hypothyroidism (HT) to be 4.6% of the US population. This study aimed to update estimates of HT prevalence in the United States by retrospective analysis of 2 datasets. Data on HT type (overt or subclinical HT) and treatment were collected from the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles. From the Optum administrative claims database, medical and pharmacy claims were collected between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2019. Patients were defined as having HT if, per given year, they had >1 prescription for HT treatment, >1 claim indicating an HT diagnosis, or thyroid-stimulating hormone levels >4.0 mIU/L (NHANES arm). For both studies, treatment was defined as any evidence of synthetic or natural thyroid hormone replacement, identified by pharmacy claims or patient surveys. Data are reported as percentage of patients with HT and treatments received. Between 2009 and 2012, HT prevalence remained around 9.6% of the US population. The administrative claims dataset showed that HT prevalence grew from 9.5% in 2012 to 11.7% in 2019 and that >78% of patients received thyroxine (T4) monotherapy. Similarly, the NHANES dataset showed that T4 replacement therapy was the most common treatment for HT. From 2012\u20132019, patients with untreated HT grew from 11.8% to 14.4%. The prevalence of HT in the United States has steadily increased since 2009. Likewise, the percentage of hypothyroid-diagnosed patients not receiving treatment also increased, suggesting that the increased prevalence may be due to increased cases of subclinical HT.",

            "text": "Hypothyroidism (HT) is one of the most common endocrine disorders, with clinical symptoms ranging from mild, such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and depression, to more severe manifestations that may include myxedema and death [1, 2].\nThere are 2 major forms of endogenous HT\u2014primary and secondary. Primary HT occurs when the thyroid cannot produce enough thyroid hormones. In geographic regions with insufficient iodine, primary HT is most often due to iodine deficiency. In iodine-sufficient regions, autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common cause of primary HT. Secondary, or central, HT is less common and generally stems from a dysfunctional pituitary gland or hypothalamus [1, 3]. Exogenous HT is commonly a side effect of medications (eg, amiodarone, thalidomide, iodineor lithium-containing drugs, anti-cancer immunotherapies), surgery, or radiotherapy to the head/neck region [1, 3].\nHT can be classified as either overt or subclinical. Overt HT is defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels above the\nreference range with free thyroxine (FT4) levels below the reference. Subclinical HT is defined as elevated TSH with normal FT4 levels [1]. Patients with subclinical HT may or may not present with symptoms, thus subclinical HT is typically diagnosed by laboratory tests. There is an ongoing discussion regarding how, if at all, to treat subclinical HT. A wait-and-see strategy is most common among patients with subclinical HT, as up to 4% of patients may go on to develop overt HT [2, 4, 5].\nThe most commonly prescribed treatment for HT is thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine, a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4) [1-3, 6]. Some patients may also be prescribed liothyronine, a synthetic triiodothyronine (T3) replacement therapy, despite clinical trials demonstrating little to no effect on symptoms of HT [6-8]. Indeed, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines do not recommend T3 replacement therapy, either alone or in combination with levothyroxine [9]. There is also a subgroup of patients being treated with desiccated thyroid extracts, which\nReceived: 3 March 2022. Editorial Decision: 3 November 2022.

At that time, HT prevalence was estimated to be 4.6% (0.3% overt HT and 4.3% subclinical) of the US population [12]. The NHANES dataset is a robust and diverse sample that combines data from interviews and physical examinations of participants to estimate vital and health statistics of the general US population. As of 2012, the NHANES is no longer collecting thyroid profiles from participants. Estimates of HT have not been systematically updated since those published in 2002, and thus currently cited values may underestimate the true prevalence of HT in the United States and prevent healthcare professionals from adequate screening to facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment [12].\nThe aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of HT in the United States and to determine the proportion of patients receiving HT treatment, as well as the type of therapies most often prescribed. Two methods were used to assess this \u2014data from the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 NHANES cycles and retrospective data analysis using medical/pharmacy claims data from 2012 to 2019 from the Optum administrative claims database."

After 2012, NHANES stopped collecting thyroid function tests data, thus no further HT prevalence assessments could be done. An alternative method of continuing to assess HT prevalence was through database claims. In this study, prevalence results for 2012 were similar between methods, suggesting that the database analysis was sufficient for estimating prevalence from 2013 onward. First, survey data from the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 NHANES cycles were obtained. Patients ages \u226512 years old were included in the NHANES thyroid profile subsample; women who were pregnant were excluded. Disease status (eg, overt or subclinical HT, disease-free) was determined from blood samples. Overt HT, based on laboratory measures, was defined as presence of elevated TSH (>4.0 mIU/L) and a subnormal or low level of FT4 ( < 0.8 ng/dL); patients with a documented prescription for HT treatment were also categorized with overt HT. Subclinical HT was defined as elevated TSH (>4.0 mIU/L) and normal FT4 (\u22650.8 ng/dL), without a documented prescription for HT treatment. Patients with subclinical HT (based on laboratory results) with a documented prescription for HT treatment were classified as overt HT. Disease-free patients had TSH levels between 0.4 and 4.0 mIU/L and no prescription for HT treatment. Eligible HT therapies were levothyroxine, liothyronine, or a combination of the 2.\nSecond, using the Optum administrative claims database, which collects longitudinal, patient-level information on medical and pharmacy claims from a geographically diverse large set of commercial electronic claims processors across the United States, data on patients \u226518 years of age, with continuous enrollment for the entirety of the calendar year, were collected\nbetween 2012 and 2019. Eligible patients had >1 medical claim indicating HT using an International Classification of Diseases 9 Clinical Modification/International Classification of Diseases 10 Clinical Modification code or >1 prescription fill for HT treatment. Information obtained from the database included patients with private, commercial insurance and governmentprovided insurance (ie, Medicaid). These HT treatments were manufactured versions of T4 (ie, levothyroxine sodium, Synthroid\u00ae, Euthyrox\u00ae, Unithroid\u00ae, Levoxyl\u00ae, Levothroid\u00ae, Levo-T\u00ae, Tirosint\u00ae), T3 (ie, liothyronine, Cytomel\u00ae), or T3/T4 combination drugs (ie, Thyrolar\u00ae, Armour Thyroid\u00ae, Nature-Throid\u00ae, NP Thyroid\u00ae, Westhroid\u00ae, WP Thyroid\u00ae)."

Using NHANES data from the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 cycles, the prevalence and percentage of HT stratified by overt or subclinical disease, as well as percentage of patients receiving treatment and the types of therapies prescribed, were assessed. Using medical and pharmacy claims data from a commercially insured population, the annual prevalence of HT, the percentage of patients with HT receiving treatment, and the type of treatments they were prescribed were evaluated. Reported treatments are categorized by type: T3 replacement therapy, T4 replacement therapy, T3/T4 combination therapy (ie, 1 therapy that combines both T3 and T4 replacement or treatment with separate T3 and T4 replacement therapies within the same year), or no evidence of treatment.\nNHANES Variables Presence and type of HT were defined by elevated TSH and subnormal/low FT4 levels identified using the NHANES variables LBDTSH1S and LBXT4F, respectively. Covariables, such as patient demographic characteristics, insurance status, and self-reported comorbidities, were indexed using the NHANES variable codes listed in Table 1."

The total number of patients identified as having HT each year were included in the numerator for prevalence estimates for that year. Descriptive analysis was used to assess HT prevalence measures from the NHANES dataset. HT was determined either as (1) evidence of current medication to treat HT or (2) evidence of laboratory results consistent with HT. Weights were applied according to the variable with the smallest sample across all variables used in a calculation (ie, the thyroid panel). Combined years weighting followed rules as detailed in NHANES weighting tutorials [13].

According to medical/pharmacy claims data, this value rose from 9.8% in 2013 to 11.7% in 2019. Based on these data, prevalence estimates of HT in the United States have more than doubled since the last systematic evaluation [12]. This study also demonstrated that T4 replacement therapy dominates prescribed treatment for HT in the United States with nearly 80% of patients receiving T4 monotherapy.\nFigure 1.

Based on laboratory data from the NHANES 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 cycles, and stratified using TSH >4.5 mIU/L, this study estimated overt HT prevalence to be 2.0%\u2014vastly greater than previous estimates. It is important to note that the 2002 NHANES study estimated HT prevalence based on laboratory values, regardless of treatment status [12]. As such, patients who were receiving treatment and had normalized laboratory values\nwere not included, and thus the prevalence findings may have been an underestimation. Using the same parameters, this study also estimated that 0.9% of the US population had untreated subclinical HT. In this study, patients with subclinical HT laboratory values who were receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy were classified as overt HT and thus may explain why our estimate is considerably lower than previous NHANES estimates of 4.3% [13]. However, this study consistently demonstrated, using NHANES data, that overall HT prevalence had more than doubled by 2012 (4.6% vs 9.6%). Moreover, using administrative claims data, this study also demonstrated that overall prevalence\nFigure 3.

There were no changes to clinical practice guidelines regarding HT that may account for these increases, suggesting more research is needed to identify the underlying drivers of the prevalence increment. Interestingly, prevalence among younger patients (<50 years) remained low and stable (2\u20137%) from 2012 to 2019 (Fig. 3). Overall prevalence increases to 10% to 11% in patients \u226550 years and further to 16% to 18% in patients \u226560 years old. Increasing prevalence of HT with increasing age is in line with previous reports and highlights the importance of routine screening in older patients [1, 2, 12]. This study also showed interesting trends in regional differences in HT prevalence. The cause of these trends cannot be elucidated from our dataset; however, it is possible that differences in population demographics, such as age, or iodine status may play a role. Indeed, other studies have provided conflicting reports on the association between iodine status and thyroid abnormalities [14, 15], thus further study on this phenomenon is warranted.\nWhile there is ongoing discussion about how, if at all, to treat patients with subclinical HT, this study demonstrated that 14.4% of patients diagnosed with HT (overt or subclinical) in 2019 remained untreated. HT has been linked to several other chronic diseases, and it is possible that untreated HT may contribute to increased morbidity. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 National Diabetes Statistics Report, approximately 13% of all US adults have diabetes mellitus (DM), with 21.4% unaware of their disease [16]. Moreover, prevalence of DM has steadily increased since 1999 when prevalence was estimated at 9.5% of adults in the United States [16]. Prevalence of subclinical HT in patients with type 2 DM approaches 20% [17]. Both type 1 and type 2 DM have been associated, and commonly coexist, with HT [17, 18]. Type\n1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease given the overlapping pathology of each disease. Type 2 DM and HT have similar symptoms that may mask the presence of the other. The hepatic glucose transporter type 2 gene, an enzyme necessary for insulinmediated glucose transport, has been shown to be downregulated in HT, resulting in reduced insulin sensitivity [18, 19].\nLipid metabolism has also been shown to be affected by alterations in thyroid hormone levels. Thyroid hormones induce enzymes necessary for cholesterol biosynthesis and regulate receptors necessary for metabolism of lipoproteins. In patients with HT, biosynthesis of new cholesterol is downregulated, yet activity of low-density lipoprotein receptors is also reduced, resulting in increased levels of low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol; some studies have also shown increased triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels [20, 21]. In 2016, it was estimated that 12.4% and 18.4% of adults (\u226520 years) had high total cholesterol and low highdensity lipoprotein levels, respectively\u2014both of which are risk factors for CVD [22]. These values are marked declines from those first reported in 2000 (18.3% and 22.2%, respectively), most likely due to advancements in therapies (ie, statins) [22, 23]. It is important to note that over half of patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia are receiving treatment [23, 24].\nThe link between HT and poor cardiovascular outcomes has long been established. Thyroid hormones have a substantial effect on cardiovascular function, and there is evidence that long-term alteration in thyroid hormones produces lasting effects on cardiovascular health [25]. Namely, HT results in decreased cardiac output, impaired relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, and increased arterial stiffness and systemic vascular resistance. Altogether, these effects impact cardiac function and promote heart failure. These changes also lead\nFigure 5.

Moreover, thyroid hormones play a role in cardiac electrophysiology, and HT has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias, especially Torsades de pointes and atrial fibrillation [19, 25]. Like HT, prevalence of CVD (including coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke but excluding hypertension) was 9.3% (approximately 26.1 million people) in 2018 [27]; this is a notable increase from statistics published in 2015, which estimated 15.5 million adults in the United States had CVD. Likewise, in 2018, hypertension was estimated to affect 45.4% of adults in the United States, an increase from 41.7% in 2014 [28]. Thus, the increasing prevalence of HT coincides with increases in the prevalence of risks for CVD.\nThe prevalence of concurrent DM, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia increased from 3.0% in 2000 to 6.3% in 2012 [29]. While the data presented here are not causal evidence, the argument can be made that, given the underlying disease mechanisms and biochemical roles of thyroid hormones in homeostatic function, increasing prevalence of HT may play a role in the increasing prevalence of several other diseases. However, studies specifically on metabolic syndrome, which encompasses all 3 diseases, are lacking, and more research is needed to establish a link between HT and metabolic syndrome [30].\nA strength of this study is the use of 2 large, geographically diverse datasets that provide a good representation of the US population. The NHANES dataset is robust data from interviews and physical examinations of participants to consistently estimate vital and health statistics of the general US population. The methodology to characterize HT within the NHANES dataset in this study allowed for inclusion of the successfully treated HT population (with laboratory values in normal range) in the overall HT estimate, whereas the NHANES III estimates relied solely on laboratory values to determine HT status, both clinical and subclinical [12]. The retrospective claims database had a large sample, allowing for a robust prevalence estimate. Year-after-year estimates allow for the examination of trends in prevalence. Claims-based analysis allows for the examination of diagnosed prevalence, which reduces the risk of overestimating the rate of HT. Additionally, we examined the actual prescription or medication fills to determine the rate and type of treatment patients received.\nThere are general limitations inherent to retrospective study designs and in the secondary use of data. This study used crosssectional, retrospective data and cannot determine causality for HT. While associations can be observed regarding comorbidities with treated or untreated HT, temporality cannot be determined as related to development of HT. Likewise, using cross-sectional data does not allow for retesting for overt HT or subclinical HT, which is important for confirming a diagnosis of HT. NHANES data that contain the thyroid panel, while ideal in estimating US prevalence of treated and untreated HT, are somewhat dated. Current cycles of NHANES do not collect thyroid panels, and it is unknown if these panels will be collected in subsequent cycles. Likewise, data obtained from patient surveys rely on patient perspectives and memory and are, as a result, subject to recall bias, which could affect survey outcomes [31]. Because patients can be included in the study by either evidence of medication use or lab results and diagnosis rates were estimated by evidence of treatment with thyroid medication, the diagnosis rate may be slightly inflated and overestimate the actual prevalence of HT due to the utilization of desiccated therapies for off-label uses, such as weight loss, as\nwell as the inability to separate patients with overt HT receiving treatment from those with subclinical HT receiving treatment. Moreover, data regarding thyroid function tests prior to the start of replacement therapy was not available, thus it is possible that patients with normal TSH/FT4 levels but prescribed therapy are included in and may inflate the estimation of the prevalence of overt HT. Prevalence of subclinical HT may be underestimated in this sample since any patient receiving HT treatment was classified as overt HT. For the Optum administrative claims data, which includes both private (ie, commercial) and public (ie, government-provided) insurance, it is possible that there is a delay in filing medical claims by the providers. Exposures and outcomes of interest are only captured if a patient has an interaction with the healthcare system. Due to the open nature of the claims data used in this study, continuous enrollment is approximated by patterns of encounters for individual patients during the study period. Filled prescriptions are only proxies for actual consumption; it is assumed the patients took their medication as directed. The commercial claims database may not be representative of the general HT population and may underestimate overall HT prevalence."

            "text": "Since the last systematic evaluation, overall prevalence (including overt and subclinical HT) has more than doubled in the United States based on NHANES and medical claims data. The prevalence of overt HT in the United States has significantly increased over the past 2 decades and, as of 2019, has continued to steadily rise, affecting around 30 million people age 18+ in the United States based on prevalence estimates from this analysis projected onto the 2019 US population [32]. The cause/causes of this prevalence rate increment have not yet been assessed but may point to a more conservative wait-and-see approach to treating asymptomatic or subclinical HT patients. These data demonstrated that T4 monotherapy has remained the standard of care for HT and maintain that screening for HT continues to be an important aspect of routine care, particularly in the elderly where prevalence is highest. Given the impact subclinical HT may have on several other diseases, further research regarding treatment of patients with subclinical HT is important to further assess the need to mitigate morbidity risk among the US population."
