    "abstractText": "SpaceOAR, a polyethylene-glycol hydrogel, reduces rectal radiation exposure during radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Previously, our group reported the modified technique of hydrogel insertion, which achieves greater separated distance at prostate-apex. This study aimed to investigate the impact of separated distance at prostate-apex and our modifier technique, on radiation exposure reduction during proton beam therapy (PBT). We included 330 patients undergoing PBT with the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 63 Gray (Gy) for localized prostate cancer, and categorized them into groups 0 (no spacer, n = 141), 1 (separated distance of spacer at the prostate-apex level < 7.5 mm, n = 81), and 2 (distance \u2265 7.5 mm, n = 108). The rectal volumes to receive 30\u201360 Gy (RBE), was estimated and described as Rectal V30\u201360 (ml) in 10 Gy increments. The Rectal V30\u201360 (ml) was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1, and in group 1 than in group 0. After propensity score matching, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the most significant factor to reduce radiation exposure was our modified technique of hydrogel insertion. Therefore, using a hydrogel spacer to expand the prostate\u2013rectum distance not only at prostate-mid to prostate-base level but also at the prostate-apex level can reduce the radiation exposure in PBT for prostate cancer.",

Previously, our group reported the modified technique of hydrogel insertion, which achieves greater separated distance at prostate-apex. This study aimed to investigate the impact of separated distance at prostate-apex and our modifier technique, on radiation exposure reduction during proton beam therapy (PBT). We included 330 patients undergoing PBT with the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 63 Gray (Gy) for localized prostate cancer, and categorized them into groups 0 (no spacer, n = 141), 1 (separated distance of spacer at the prostate-apex level < 7.5 mm, n = 81), and 2 (distance \u2265 7.5 mm, n = 108). The rectal volumes to receive 30\u201360 Gy (RBE), was estimated and described as Rectal V30\u201360 (ml) in 10 Gy increments. The Rectal V30\u201360 (ml) was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1, and in group 1 than in group 0. After propensity score matching, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the most significant factor to reduce radiation exposure was our modified technique of hydrogel insertion. Therefore, using a hydrogel spacer to expand the prostate\u2013rectum distance not only at prostate-mid to prostate-base level but also at the prostate-apex level can reduce the radiation exposure in PBT for prostate cancer.\nProstate cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in men worldwide, with 1,414,000 cases and 374,000 estimated deaths in 20201. External beam therapy and brachytherapy are among the standard treatments for localized prostate cancer2\u20135; however, the adverse events (AEs) of rectal radiation exposure resulting from prostate\u2013rectum proximity are significant clinical issues6,7. To reduce the issue of prostate\u2013rectum proximity, researchers have reported several biomaterials used for increasing the distance between the prostate and the rectum to minimize rectal radiation exposure8\u201310. Polyethylene-glycol (PEG) hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR; Boston Scientific Japan, Tokyo, Japan) is one of the materials approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is designed to reduce rectal radiation exposure during radiation therapy for prostate cancer11\u201315. Creating at least 7.5\u00a0mm space between the prostate and the rectum at the prostate-mid level using SpaceOAR was reported to be a technical success in 96.6% of cases before the introduction of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT; 78\u00a0Gy delivered over an 8-week period)16. However, in clinical practice, the dilated distance between the prostate and the rectum at the prostate-apex level tends to be lower than that of prostate-mid and prostate-base levels. Given that the toxicity by radiation exposure generally depends on the proximity between the prostate and the rectum, the dilated distance at the prostate-apex level potentially exerts influence on the severity of rectal radiation exposure. We recently reported the feasibility and safety of a modified technique of inserting a spacer in achieving a greater prostate\u2013rectum distance at the prostate-apex level17. However, we found few reports about the influence of expanding the distance between the prostate and the rectum using a hydrogel spacer on toxicity by radiation\nOPEN\n1Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji 465, Kyoto, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan. 2Department of Radiology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji 465, Kyoto, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan. 3These authors contributed equally: Tsukasa Narukawa, Norihiro Aibe and Masashi Tsujimoto. *email: tnarukaw@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:18319 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45557-7\nexposure18. Hence, this study aimed to investigate whether increasing the distance between the prostate and the rectum at prostate-apex level using a hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR) reduces the rectal radiation exposure during PBT for prostate cancer. In addition, previous reports defined at least 7.5\u00a0mm space at the prostate-mid level was defined as technical success16, therefore, at least 7.5\u00a0mm space at prostate-apex was used as threshold in this study."

The inclusion criteria for the use of the hydrogel spacer were localized prostate cancers without suspicious of contact with the rectum. We enrolled 330 patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent PBT of 63\u00a0Gy (relative biological effectiveness RBE) in 21 fractions and postoperative MRI of the prostate before PBT introduction. The indication for treatment was judged during the PBT conference, which consists of department of urology and radiation therapy members, between May 2019 and February 2021. The spacer insertion was performed between August 2019 and August 2021. Androgen deprivation therapy was started before PBT, and it has been continued for certain periods according to the clinical stage or risk classification. All the patients, with written informed consent, underwent placement of gold fiducial markers to increase the accuracy for PBT targeting, and insertion of a hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR) to reduce rectal radiation exposure was performed for eligible patients at the same time. These patients were categorized into three groups: group 0 (no spacer, n = 141), group 1 (rectum\u2013prostate distance at the prostate-apex level of < 7.5\u00a0mm, n = 81), and group 2 (distance \u2265 7.5\u00a0mm, n = 108). Using preplanning computed tomography examination, we measured the rectal volumes to receive 30\u201360\u00a0Gy (RBE), described as Rectal V30\u201360 (ml) in 10\u00a0Gy increments. The hydrogel spacer remained in place for 3\u00a0months, and then hydrolyzing into liquid and absorbed in the body over several months. Hence, AEs (e.g., genitourinary gastrointestinal AEs and others such as cystitis, urethritis, dermatitis, hot flush, fatigue, and macrohematuria) appearing within 4\u00a0months after spacer implantation were evaluated and describes as acute AEs. The AEs appeared after that were also evaluated and, described as late AEs. The late AEs also included genitourinary, gastrointestinal AEs and others such as hot flash, sexual dysfunction (e.g., erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and decrease in semen), muscle weakness, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, angina pectoris symptom, and pelvic discomfort.\nThe AEs of each patient was evaluated by the each attending radiologist who didn\u2019t know the operator of spacer insertion, and the data was obtained from medical record database retrospectively. The AEs were categorized according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0."

The clinical target volume (CTV) included 3\u00a0mm margin around prostate and seminal vesicles. The CTV was modified based on anatomical boundaries or physician\u2019s discretion and the volume of targeted seminal vesicles was dependent on the risk classification. For the robustness of plan, 3-mm lateral margin was used, and the proximal and distal margin of 3.5% range + 1\u00a0mm was used to reduce the range uncertainty20. Treatment plan was built as the 98% of CTV was encompassed by the 100% prescribed dose, or 63\u00a0Gy (RBE). Patients were instructed to empty their rectum as much as possible and to urinate 1\u00a0h before treatment. Daily patient alignments were achieved by first performing bone registration and then matching fiducial markers. Our proton delivery system only deliveres when the fiducial marker is within \u00b1 2\u00a0mm of the planned position."

Using transrectal ultrasound scan (TRUS) guidance under local anesthesia with transperineal injection, we inserted the gold markers into the prostate. In inserting the spacer into the Denonvilliers space (fatty tissue between prostate and anterior rectal wall), the space was first expanded through saline solution injection. After confirmation of the proper location of the applicator needle for the spacer, 10\u00a0ml of PEG precursors were injected through the needle tip. In the conventional technique, the needle tip remained at the prostate-mid level during the injection, and all the procedures were performed under the real-time TRUS monitoring16. All PEG precursors must be injected within 10\u00a0s to form enough distance between the prostate and the rectum. However, in this conventional technique, the spacer would likely provide enough expansion in the prostate-mid and -base levels (where the needle tip is directed toward) but unlikely in the prostate-apex level.\nHowever, in our reported modified technique, immediately after the hydrogel was confirmed to be injected in the distal end, the needle tip would be quickly moved back under the prostate-apex level, and hydrogel injection would be continued, resulting in enough hydrogel thickness throughout the Denonvilleier space under the prostate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01)17. If the needle tip was missed during the procedure, movement should be stopped at that time. The modified technique was not deviated from the manufacture\u2019s instruction and performed within the scope of daily medical treatment. Within the study period, five different urologists (TN, TS, AU, KT, and MK) performed spacer injection. TN developed the novel modified technique after 18 cases of conventional method and only has applied since April 2020; other urologists performed the operation on only 5\u201326 cases and used the conventional method. The number of cases performed by each urologist and its technique were shown in supplementary Table\u00a01. All the urologists were specialists of urology with enough experience and a license. None of the patients had hydrogel injection\u2013related AEs of grade 3 or higher, but one in each group experienced grade 2 AEs (e.g., transient dysuria), which improved spontaneously within a few days.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:18319 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45557-7\nMeasurement of the distance between the prostate and the rectum by an injected spacer The distance between the prostate and the rectum expanded by the injected spacer was evaluated using the T2-weighted image of postoperative MRI obtained before PBT introduction, and the hydrogel was recognized as a hyperintense signal. In particular, the distance at the prostate-apex level was measured using the axial T2-weighted image of the MRI21, whereas that at the prostate-mid and prostate-base levels was measured using the midsagittal T2-weighted image slice of the MRI (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). The rectal wall infiltration of spacer (RWI) was also evaluated by using the axial T2-weighted image of MRI."

In fact, Fukumitsu et\u00a0al. reported greater hydrogel thickness at the prostate-apex level, causing a smaller radiation exposure to the rectum18. Our group reported the feasibility and safety of the modified hydrogel insertion technique, which achieved greater hydrogel thickness at the prostate-apex level than the conventional technique17. We found that the estimated rectal radiation exposure dose was reduced according to the hydrogel thickness at the prostate-apex level. Taken together, considering that conventional methods tend to cause lesser hydrogel thickness at the prostate-apex level, increasing the hydrogel thickness at such level may reduce the rectal radiation exposure.\nAfter the matched pair analysis between groups 1 and 2, our insertion technique was the only statistically significant factor that created an impact on achieving at least 7.5\u00a0mm hydrogel thickness. According to previous reports, procedure-associated AEs of grade 2 or more occurred in 3.3% of cases23, and among the recently reported AEs were severe rectal injury and spacer migration into the periprostatic venous plexus24,25. Therefore, evaluating the safety of the insertion technique is important. Given that TRUS was reported to be useful for the surgical navigation and diagnosis of prostate cancer26, monitoring the needle tip during injection by real-time TRUS is important to prevent complications related to the location of injection. Although our institute didn\u2019t routinely evaluate spacer thromboembolism, there was no clinically significant thromboembolism, in this study period.\nDespite the real-time TRUS guidance, modified technique might increase the rate of RWI due to the moving technique. In practice, the rate of RWI was higher in group 2, than group 1. In a previous report, the RWI incidence occurred in 6% of spacer cases, however, the incidence was not correlated with procedure-related adverse events or acute/late rectal toxicity27. In this study, all the patients completed the PBT treatment without any G3\u00a0\u2264\u00a0AEs, with or without the RWI, hence, the influence of RWI was considered to be limited, in the real world.\nAlthough hydrogel thickness at the prostate-apex level could lead to urinary dysfunction resulting from obstruction of the urethra close to the prostate-apex, the modified technique group only had one patient (1%) reported to have experienced transient dysuria. Nonetheless, the symptoms recovered within a few days. Considering that the rate of acute G2 genitourinary AEs was smaller in group 2 than in group 1, the acute genitourinary AEs might depend on not hydrogel thickness but the patients\u2019 characteristics such as prostate volume and past history of neurogenic bladder. That is because, about the baseline urinary status, the IPSS and rate of medication for urinary symptoms were also lower in group 2 than group 1.\nThermal-ablation technologies such as cryoablation and microwave coagulation are reportedly effective for controlling clinically significant cancer28. Such thermal-ablation therapies need a safety margin between the target lesion and anterior rectal wall to avoid rectal injury from thermal energy. Similar to this study, our group reported the importance of sufficient hydrogel thickness for cryoablation and microwave coagulation therapy in a cadaver model29,30, and our modified hydrogel insertion technique could potentially broaden the adaptation not only for radiation therapy.\nThis study has several limitations, such as a small sample size, the retrospective study design, and the short follow-up period. Moreover, as a significant limitation, hydrogel thickness might depend on not only insertion technique, but also the operator\u2019s experience and learning curve31, because only one operator (TN) performed the modified technique1, which accounted over half of the cases in this study. Even if that were true, an ingenuity\nTable 3. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the cumulative incidence of achieving at least 7.5\u00a0mm separated distance at the prostate-apex level.

Interestingly, in spite of a short follow-up period, as a late gastrointestinal AE, G2 radiation proctitis only occurred in 6 patients of group 0, and G1 radiation proctitis rate was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (8.6% and 0.9%, respectively). Thus, the distance between the prostate and the rectum should be expanded to mitigate the rectal radiation dose during radiation therapy for prostate cancer, and which could potentially decrease the late gastrointestinal AEs. Recently, SpaceOAR Vue (Boston Scientific Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and Hyaluronic Acid Spacer are also used for radiation therapy of prostate cancer as a spacer. The modified technique is expected to be useful for their spacer insertion32,33. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the impact of expanding the distance between the prostate-apex and the rectum using a hydrogel spacer for prostate cancer before PBT."
