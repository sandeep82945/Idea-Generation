    "abstractText": "The cosmological recombination radiation (CRR) is one of the guaranteed spectral distortion signals from the early Universe. The CRR photons from hydrogen and helium pre-date the last scattering process and as such allow probing physical phenomena in the pre-recombination era. Here we compute the modifications to the CRR caused by early dark energy models and varying fundamental constants. These new physics examples have seen increased recent activity in connection with the Hubble tension, motivating the exploratory study presented here. The associated CRR responses are spectrally-rich but the level of the signals is small. We forecast the possible sensitivity of future spectrometers to these effects. Our estimates demonstrate that the CRR directly depends to changes in the expansion history and recombination physics during the pre-recombination era. However, futuristic sensitivities are required for spectrometer-only constraints that are competitive with other cosmological probes. Nevertheless, measurements of the CRR can directly reach into phases that otherwise remain inaccessible, highlighting the potential these types of observations could have as a probe of the early Universe. A combination with Planck data further shows that a synergistic approach is very promising.",

            "text": "In modern cosmology, our detailed understanding of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has opened the floodgates to precision tests of the \u039bCDM model and different flavours of new physics beyond. This has been made possible with precise measurements of the CMB anisotropies using space- and ground-based experiments (Bennett et al. 2013; Niemack et al. 2010; Planck Collaboration et al. 2020). Next generation CMB experiments furthermore promise to uncover unparalleled details of the background radiation, allowing us to probe even deeper into the underpinnings of cosmology (Matsumura et al. 2014; Abazajian et al. 2016; Ade et al. 2019).\nIn spite of the great successes for the \u039bCDM model, many extensions have been considered. Additions to the standard model of cosmology have included modifications of the effective numbers of relativistic species and sterile neutrinos (Gratton et al. 2008; Nollett & Holder 2011; Battye & Moss 2014; Lesgourgues & Pastor 2014; Abazajian et al. 2015), dark matter annihilation (Padmanabhan & Finkbeiner 2005; Galli et al. 2009; H\u00fctsi et al. 2009; Chluba 2010), primordial magnetic fields (Sethi & Subramanian 2005; Shaw & Lewis 2010; Kunze & Komatsu 2014; Chluba et al. 2015; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016; Paoletti et al. 2019; Jedamzik & Saveliev 2019; Jedamzik & Pogosian 2020) and variations of fundamental constants (Avelino et al. 2001; Battye et al. 2001; Galli et al. 2011; Menegoni et al. 2012; Planck Collaboration et al. 2015; Hart & Chluba 2018, 2020). So far, no significant deviation from the\u039bCDM model has been identified. However, several tensions have been discussed (see Perivolaropoulos & Skara 2022; Abdalla et al. 2022,\nfor review). Of these, the Hubble tension, a discrepancy of the average expansion rate between the early and late Universe, seems to persist and grow in significance, suggesting modifications to fundamental physics might be required (Bernal et al. 2016; Verde et al. 2019; Di Valentino et al. 2021).\nIndeed, several of the aforementioned new physics examples have been applied in an attempt to alleviate the notorious Hubble tension (see Sch\u00f6neberg et al. 2022, for a comparative study). One viable solution is connected to the presence of an oscillating scalar field, such as those relating to ultra-light axions (henceforth ULA), as has been considered with the consequences for the CMB anisotropies outlined in Poulin et al. (2018). The dynamical dilution of this field in the pre-recombination era leads to an early dark energy phenomenon, changing the expansion rate before last scattering (Poulin et al. 2019). This scalar field can be treated like an effective dark energy fluid, an approximation which has been rigorously tested against the direct field evolution (Smith et al. 2020). However, the jury is still out on whether or not this can be reconciled with large-scale structure and BAO data at lower redshifts (Ivanov et al. 2020; Smith et al. 2021; Simon et al. 2022; Cruz et al. 2022). Several similar dark energy theories have built on these ideas (e.g., Lin et al. 2019; Alestas et al. 2020; Hill et al. 2020; McDonough et al. 2022; Karwal et al. 2022; Wang & Piao 2022; Kojima & Okubo 2022), and most recently, even a link to possible detection of birefringence was drawn (Murai et al. 2022).\nAnother promising addition to the standard model of cosmology that could alleviate the Hubble tension involves the variations\n\u00a9 2022 RAS\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n12 29\n0v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n2 5\nSe p\n20 22\nof fundamental constants (Hart & Chluba 2020). In the interactions between matter and radiation, the main fundamental constants that garner interesting physical insights are the fine structure constant (\ud835\udefcEM) and the effective electron mass (\ud835\udc5ae). At low redshifts (\ud835\udc67 . 2), the fine-structure constant has been tested with many astrophysical probes such as quasar absorption spectra (Bize et al. 2003; Murphy & Cooksey 2017; Kotu\u0161 et al. 2017; Levshakov et al. 2019; Wilczynska et al. 2020), white dwarves (Hu et al. 2021) and black holes (Hees et al. 2020). More recently, variations in the electron-proton mass ratio have also been studied using quasar spectra (Levshakov et al. 2020). These works all indicate consistency with the standard value known from local lab experiements.\nAt higher redshifts, the changes in the 21cm line radiation that arise due to variations in the fine structure constant have been forecasted for future experiments (Lopez-Honorez et al. 2020). Similarly, the changes to the light element abundances arising from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) have been tested for fundamental constant variations (Avelino et al. 2001; Coc et al. 2013; Alvey et al. 2020). However, the effects of varying fundamental constants (VFCs) on the CMB anisotropies indicate an interesting avenue in connection with the Hubble tension. With the most recent Planckdata, the specific dependencies of these constants during recombination have shown unique imprints during hydrogen and helium recombination (Hart & Chluba 2018). Specifically, the variations from the recombination epoch lead to a significant geometric degeneracy between \ud835\udc5ae and \ud835\udc3b0 which can alleviate the Hubble tension (Hart & Chluba 2020). Several reviews have been published on the motivation and various methods of detecting VFCs (Uzan 2003, 2011; Martins 2017), and it is important to ask if there are indeed new methods for shedding light on early VFCs.\nThe study of models that alter the expansion history of the universe can be carried out with many of the aforementioned cosmological probes (e.g., CMB anisotropies, weak lensing, 21cm). As explored recently, primordial \ud835\udf07-type spectral distortions of the CMB may also provide information on the expansion rate (Lucca 2020). However, a particular distortion that directly probes different periods of cosmological time is the cosmological recombination radiation (CRR) from \ud835\udc67 ' 1000 \u2212 8000 (Sunyaev & Chluba 2009). Predicted by \u039bCDM, this distortion arises as the CMB photon field departs from thermal equilibrium due to the transitions within hydrogen and helium atoms as well as the continuum during recombination (Zeldovich et al. 1968; Peebles 1968). This manifests as a unique spectral signal in the CMB spectrum (Dubrovich 1975; Rybicki & dell\u2019Antonio 1994), which can now be accurately computed using CosmoSpec (Chluba & Ali-Ha\u00efmoud 2016). Given the superposition of hydrogen and helium lines, the spectral changes caused by variations in cosmological parameters can be constrained with futuristic spectrometers (e.g., PRISM, Voyage 2050) (PRISM Collaboration et al. 2013, 2014; Desjacques et al. 2015; Sathyanarayana Rao et al. 2015; Chluba et al. 2021; Hart et al. 2020). Similarly, new physics can affect the dynamics of the recombination process and thus leave unique imprints in the CRR (Rubi\u00f1o-Mart\u00edn et al. 2008; Chluba & Sunyaev 2008, 2009).\nIn this paper, we will outline the ways that the CRR can probe the effects from early dark energy theories and variations of the fundamental constants \ud835\udefcEM and \ud835\udc5ae. In Section 2, we introduce the approach used in the previous ULA constraints papers (Poulin et al. 2018; Poulin et al. 2019) and revisit the main effects on the background expansion history. We then study how early dark energy can affect the ionisation history and consequently, impact the recombination lines in unique ways. We briefly discuss the detectability of these variations for different models using rudimentary signal-noise\npredictions and then investigate more complete parameter correlations with a Fisher matrix analysis. Our estimates are meant to give a first rough feeling about the observability of these effects; however, a rigorous analysis in combination with CMB anisotropy constraints is left for a future investigation.\nIn Section 3, we show the differences in the CRR caused by VFCs. We explain how these variations can be related to the features discussed in Hart & Chluba (2018) with a particular emphasis on the modifications to the recombination process caused by these changes. We provide a comparative study indicating the impact of including CMB anisotropy results with future spectrometers. This leads to discussion on the possible solutions to the Hubble tension involving \ud835\udc5ae (Hart & Chluba 2020, 2021)."

The field dynamics lead to an evolving energy density,\n\u03a9\ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc67) = 2\u03a9\ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc67 c)\n1 + [(1 + \ud835\udc67 c) /(1 + \ud835\udc67)] 3(1+\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b) , (1)\nwith an equation of state,\n1 + \ud835\udc64\ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc67) = 1 + \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b\n1 + [(1 + \ud835\udc67) /(1 + \ud835\udc67 c)] 3(1+\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b) . (2)\nHere \ud835\udc67 c signifies the redshift when the field becomes dynamical and \ud835\udc5b, the order of the oscillating potential for a ULA field (Poulin et al. 2018, for more details), determines the dilution rate of the energy density according to \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b = (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) /(\ud835\udc5b + 1).\nThe energy density for several potential orders, \ud835\udc5b, are illustrated in Fig. 1. To quantify the amplitude of the early dark energy density, we will use the parametrisation \ud835\udc53EDE = \u03a9\ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc67 c)/\u03a9tot (\ud835\udc67 c), following previous ULA papers. At early times (\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc67 c), the early dark energy behaves like a cosmological constant due to the Hubble friction term of the evolving field. As the dark energy fluid becomes dynamical, it decays according to \u03a9\ud835\udf19 \u221d (1 + \ud835\udc67)3(1+\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b) . For \ud835\udc5b = 2, 3 this means the early dark energy density drops off like radiation or an ultra-relativistic species respectively. In the extreme case that \ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e, the field energy density rapidly decays \u221d \ud835\udc4e\u22126. This corresponds to the field energy being totally dominated by kinetic term, similar to a scalar field term1.\nHere will we discuss the impact of an early dark energy contribution to the recombination lines so it is important to emphasise that we will only consider the effects on the background physics. In this case we do not consider the full changes to perturbations carried out in previous analyses, rather we consider the changes to the recombination process due to the altered expansion history shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we ensure that flatness is conserved for these models (i.e., \u03a9\u039b \u2192 \u03a9\u039b + \u03a9\ud835\udf19,0). This condition should not directly affect the recombination lines, as \u03a9\u039b only becomes important at late times. The recombination calculations are carried out using CosmoRec (Chluba & Thomas 2011) with the CosmoSpec module (Chluba & Ali-Ha\u00efmoud 2016) to compute the CRR. This allows us to cleanly propagate all the effects on the hydrogen and helium recombination dynamics.\n1 This was explored with detailed changes to the background cosmology in Karwal & Kamionkowski (2016).\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\nCurrent constraints on \ud835\udc53EDE derived from CMB and largescale structure measurements imply \ud835\udc53EDE ' 0.05 \u2212 0.1 for critical redshifts \ud835\udc67 c ' 3000 \u2212 4000 [and fixed \ud835\udc5b ' 3] (Hill et al. 2020; Simon et al. 2022; Cruz et al. 2022). To better illustrate the effects on the CRR, we will use larger values of \ud835\udc53EDE ' 0.3\u2212 0.5 and also widen the range of critical redshifts explored for varying values of \ud835\udc5b as stated. The value of \ud835\udc53EDE will mostly lead to an overall rescaling\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\nof the corresponding signals, while both \ud835\udc67 c and \ud835\udc5b affect the shape of the distortion responses, as we illustrate below."

            "text": "The modifications to the background dynamics propagate to the ionisation history. The changes to the Hubble rate \ud835\udc3b (\ud835\udc67) alter the total energy density of the Universe as a function of time and affect the mapping to redshift (see Fig. 2). Consequently, recombination is delayed as can be seen from the ionisation history (\ud835\udc4be) variations shown in Fig. 3. These are compared to the case for standard\u039bCDM (gold/dashed). For all dilution rates, the variations in \ud835\udc4be are larger for a lower critical redshift, \ud835\udc67 c = 1500. Due to the smaller relative helium fractions (and helium feedback processes at \ud835\udc67 ' 2000, Chluba & Sunyaev 2010; Chluba et al. 2012), the relative changes in the ionisation history are more pronounced during hydrogen recombination, which is expected to lead to greater variations in the Thomson visibility function (since the Thomson visibility is larger around the last scattering epoch at \ud835\udc67 ' 1100).\nHowever the residuals of the ionisation history shown in Fig. 4 reveal the bigger picture for the earlier epochs of recombination. For both cases (\ud835\udc67 c = 1500 and \ud835\udc67 c = 6000), this corresponds to a positive residual in the ionisation history (\u0394\ud835\udc4be/\ud835\udc4be > 0). When the critical redshift (the time when the field becomes dynamical and the energy density dilutes) is shifted from the hydrogen recombination era (\ud835\udc67 c = 1500) to the doubly-ionised helium (HeIII \u2192 HeII)\nrecombination era (\ud835\udc67 c = 6000), modifications in the epochs of helium recombination become visible. Specifically, a noticeable variation around \ud835\udc67 ' 6000 arises in the free electron fraction, while the changes during hydrogen and neutral helium recombination show an increased sensitivity to the value of \ud835\udc5b. This highlights that the CRR can in principle be used as a probe of EDE. In particular for models with \ud835\udc67 c & 5000 this could nicely complement probes based on the CMB anisotropies alone, which already tightly constrain scenarios with \ud835\udc67 c . 3000 (Simon et al. 2022)."

For illustration, we vary the dilution rate (\u2194 \ud835\udc5b) at fixed \ud835\udc53EDE = 0.5. There is very little movement in the line positions; however, the amplitudes of most spectral features is suppressed, including the Balmer-\ud835\udefc line (\ud835\udf08 ' 120 GHz) and Paschen-\ud835\udefc line (\ud835\udf08 ' 350 GHz). In addition, the lines are broadened due to the more extended duration of the recombination process. At \ud835\udf08 & 1800 GHz, we can furthermore see an increased blue-wing of the HI Lyman-\ud835\udefc line while the level of the two-photon continuum (\ud835\udf08 ' 800\u22121500 GHz) is reduced, indicating a delay in the recombination process. Since the hydrogen line emission process occurs at \ud835\udc67 ' 1400, for the chosen example the variations in the lines appear invariant with the speed of dilution (affected by \ud835\udc5b) for this model.\nIn Fig. 6, we focus our attention on the Balmer-\ud835\udefc and Paschen\ud835\udefc lines. Here, the ULA treatment of EDE is calculated with a variety of dynamical times and a radiation-like dilution (\ud835\udc5b = 2). For \ud835\udc5b = 2, we can see that even the changes of the CRR are mostly independent of the chosen dynamical time, though there is a very small (. 5%)\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\neffect for \ud835\udc67 c = 5000, which is marginally closer to the \u039bCDM case. The main conclusion from both Figs. 5 and 6 is that the variations for slower dynamical EDE models closer to the surface of last scattering are qualitatively indifferent for hydrogen recombination lines.\nWe present the contrary to this in Fig. 7, where we focus on a pre-recombination dynamical time, \ud835\udc67 c = 6000. For the different dilution models, the changes compared to \u039bCDM are heavily hindered, with the kinetic ULA example (\ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e; orange) being almost identical to the \u039bCDM case. For a dynamical field that dilutes exponentially fast, the variations do not seed in the hydrogen lines at all. Since the ULA contributions to the energy density dilute away very quickly, the hydrogen recombination process is shielded from these modifications to the expansion rate. In comparison, and with reference to the species dilution curves in Fig. 1; the denser EDE models such as radiation-like (\ud835\udc5b = 2) and ultra-relativistic (\ud835\udc5b = 3) tail off more slowly, since the dilution of the field is much harder. Consequently, the net impact on the expansion rate is larger and the interplay across the hydrogen recombination lines for an early dynamical time such as \ud835\udc67 c = 5000 becomes more apparent, as presented in Fig. 7. This shows that the CRR is sensitive to the dilution rate of EDE models with \ud835\udc67 c & 3000, as already anticipated from Fig. 4."

            "text": "As emphasised in Sec. 2.1, the helium recombination lines will be more susceptible to changes in the expansion rate encroaching on earlier epochs (\ud835\udc67 > 2000). However given the lower impact of helium recombination, both within the lines and the optical depth of CMB photons arising during the decoupling era, we expect this effect to be unique but smaller. One of the most distinctive features in helium recombination is the backwash of photons arising from feedback processes between He-I and He-II. In Fig. 8, the absorption trough for helium where \ud835\udf08 ' 270 GHz is shown. By adding the diluting field that emulates EDE, the trough shifts to higher frequencies and dips to a weaker signal (\u0394\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udf08 ' 0.002 Jy/sr). Furthermore, the profile defining this \u2018absorption\u2019 is much sharper for an EDE model. The earlier dynamical time starts to impact singly-ionized helium recombination (He-II\u2192He-I) as the Hubble flow acceler-\nates before this epoch. Consequently, the energy rates involved are naturally dampened by the increased expansion making the effects from the absorption sharper than in the \u039bCDM case.\nA wider example of this absorption feature can be seen if we look at the full He-I recombination spectra between the frequencies that are relevant for future space missions2. This is highlighted in Fig. 9, where we have also shown the impact of the full distortion against the case where bound-bound transitions are considered only (faded, dashed). Removing the logarithmic \ud835\udc66-axis, the rich structure of the helium emission and absorption features are clearer to see; however, the impact of the EDE changes does not reveal added information when we omit the bound-free absorption components in the distortions (free-free typically affects much lower frequencies). The contrast between amplification of the peaks and suppression\n2 In the PIXIE (Kogut et al. 2011) and Voyage 2050 (Chluba et al. 2021) mission concepts, the frequency bands were defined for \ud835\udf08min = 30 GHz and \ud835\udf08max = 3000 GHz.\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\nof the troughs in the wider frequency information for helium also suggests that the expansion\u2019s impact on the net energy transitions is not trivial, due to the interlinked nature of He-I recombination to both the later hydrogen recombination epoch and the earlier doublyionised helium region.\nFinally, we focus solely on the doubly-ionised helium (HeIII \u2192 HeII) region, which occurs significantly earlier (\ud835\udc67 ' 6000). In Fig. 10, the absorption between the two helium species is shown (300\u2212500 GHz) for \u039bCDM against two dilution examples. The line at \ud835\udf08 ' 380 GHz represents a pivot for the added EDE models. At lower frequencies, this feature in helium is suppressed whereas it is amplified for higher frequencies. The full recombination spectrum for doubly-ionised helium is shown for context in Fig. 11, however this was shown for \ud835\udc67 c = 6000 since it is more directly related to the doubly helium recombination era. The variations according to early dark energy all show distinct changes to the \u039bCDM CRR; however, the different dilution models do not seem to create appreciable changes in the spectra for the chosen value of \ud835\udc67 c. Whether the field dilutes as radiation or ultra-radiation, the spectra look very similar.\nThese changes arise because, as with previous cases, the dynamic changes for these models are harder to distinguish for earlier redshifts (i.e., during He-III\u2192He-II recombination). However, the knee-pivot discussed in Fig. 10 at \ud835\udf08 ' 400 GHz is an isolated large change which can be associated with continuum processes. These continuum features (discussed in more detail in Switzer & Hirata 2008; Rubi\u00f1o-Mart\u00edn et al. 2008) can be amplified if the electrons recombine into the bound states. This is more emphasised with states at higher energies, that are simultaneously closer to the ground state. There is also interplay with the fine structure lines in the helium atom (see Chluba et al. 2012, for more details).\n2.2.3 Combined effect from all the atomic species at \ud835\udc67 c = 5000\nTo illustrate the total impact of various models when the early dark energy starts diluting right in the middle of the two helium recombination eras, we show the effects on the hydrogen and two helium energy spectra in Fig. 12. For the purposes of this figure, we have increased the relative amount of EDE to \ud835\udc53EDE = 0.8. While the hydrogen lines are showing signs of spectral deviations according to the dilution slope, \ud835\udc5b; the helium atomic variants are showing\nthis less prominently. There are difference tracers in the lower frequency (\ud835\udf08 ' 200 GHz), particularly around the He-I absorption trough; however, the effects are less apparent in the helium plateau at \ud835\udf08 ' 800 GHz and there is negligible spectral variance in the doubly-ionised helium lines. This is anticipated, since the lever arm is shortest for the He-II spectrum and biggest for the H-I radiation, rendering the \ud835\udc5b-sensitivity largest for H-I. These variations are hinting that the EDE mechanism can begin to act as a pivot: highlighting not only changes in different magnitudes across the epochs, but more importantly that the impact of the sloping parameter \ud835\udc5b is non-negligible as you tune your critical redshift to earlier times.\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317"

From modelling the various combinations of the dilution speed and critical redshift for the EDE theories (i.e., \ud835\udc5b and \ud835\udc67 c), we can quantify the models with the largest net change to the \u039bCDM reference using a basic signal-to-noise (diagonal Fisher matrix) testing case (statistical use cases explained in Sellentin & Heavens 2016; Bhandari et al. 2021). Since the early dark energy fraction parameter ( \ud835\udc53EDE) is the amplitude of the signal and is fairly modelindependent (larger values of \ud835\udc53EDE imply larger responses) then this is the parameter for which we model an effective signal-to-noise ratio to identify exceptional models.\nFor this simple case study, we have isolated the frequency bins using the proposals for channels outlined for SuperPIXIE, where we consider 3 instruments: low-frequency (10 GHz < \ud835\udf08 < 40 GHz; \u0394\ud835\udf08 = 2.4 GHz), mid-frequency (20 GHz < \ud835\udf08 < 600 GHz; \u0394\ud835\udf08 = 19.2 GHz) and high-frequency (400 GHz < \ud835\udf08 < 6000 GHz; \u0394\ud835\udf08 = 57.6 GHz). The full details of this spectrometer setup can be found in many forecast proposal papers (Kogut et al. 2011; Abitbol et al. 2017; Chluba et al. 2021; Hart et al. 2020). The signal-tonoise is isolated in each bin and then the summation RMS value is taken for every given model. After evaluating each of the known dilution models [\ud835\udc5b = {2, 3,\u221e}] for a wide range of critical redshifts [\ud835\udc67 c = {1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 5000, 6000, 10000, 20000}], the full response of each model can be seen in Fig. 13. Here the specifications for a spectrometer following the Voyage 2050 outline (Hart et al. 2020) have been used to calculate an effective SNR. Note that this process omits correlated parameters but we can start to implement a basic Fisher matrix analysis and see how the parameter dependencies vary for different EDE models.\nThe SNR values for these models have been visually summarised in Fig. 13. The top five models have been quantitatively presented as a list in Table 1. As initially predicted from the large hydrogen variations in Sec. 2.2, the strongest models for a Voyage 2050 like mission have a slope consistent with a radiation-like dilution (\ud835\udc5b = 2). Constraining the EDE model requires a \u2018sweet spot\u2019 solution where the field dilutes quickly enough that the net change in dynamics across recombination is large, while not requiring such a\nhigh initial value that may affect the initial conditions. These initial conditions will ultimately affect the background as recombination lines begin to form and the non-thermal processes between electrons and photons emerge. More specifically, the variations favour a dilution that begins in the HeI recombination era (\ud835\udc67 ' 2000, 3000) since this provides the largest amount of variation within the recombination radiation for the smallest additional factor of EDE. The most constraining detectable model according to this comparison is the model is a radiation-like dilution with \ud835\udc67 c = 2000 with an SNR of 2.02 for Voyage 2050, as shown in Table 1 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc34). Note that the results shown for the SuperPIXIE and Voyage 2050+ configurations are multiplied by constant factors of 0.2 and 10 respectively, as their noise curves are defined. Surprisingly, for radiation-like dilution, a redshift switch of \ud835\udc67 c = 5000 has shown similar SNR in Table 1 (Model \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc38 ), suggesting that some of the pre-HeI recombination models can survive. Large variations from models like these will still appear during hydrogen recombination; however, as shown in Fig. 13, the sharper dilution models quickly deteriorate to low SNRs once the EDE phase-transition redshift is pushed to earlier times.\nIn summary, we can see that for radiation-like dilution (\ud835\udc5b = 2), a wide range of critical redshifts may be probed, even reaching deep into the primordial universe at \ud835\udc67 & 104. For steeper dilution, sensitivity to \ud835\udc67 c & 6000 quickly drops, and lower values of \ud835\udc67 c give preferable responses."

In Sec. 2.4.1, we will present the covariances for the 3 most constrainable models (shown in Table. 1). The EDE amplitude \ud835\udc53EDE is bound by a hard-prior where \ud835\udc53EDE > 0.

However this also neglects the involvement of foregrounds, albeit their broader spectral shape mitigates how badly they affect cosmological parameter constraints (more details in Hart et al. 2020).

Below we will illustrate how in the case of VFCs the addition of Planckpriors indeed significantly improves matters. In a similar vein, we expect significant gains for EDE models when combining CRR measurements with external data set; however, a more detailed assessment is beyond the scope of this work.\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317"

For the tables we use \ud835\udc47e = 300\u2212105 K and \ud835\udf02c = 10\u22128 \u2212108. For the singlet 21P1 \u2212 11S0 line, we use \ud835\udf0fS = 10\u22125 \u2212 1010, while for the triplet 23P1 \u2212 11S0 resonance \ud835\udf0fS = 10\u22125 \u2212 103 suffices.6 For \ud835\udf0fS \u2264 10\u22125, linear extrapolation is applied. The grid is setup in log-space with a density of 10 to 15 points per decade. A four-point Lagrange polynomial interpolation is performed in each dimension. Indeed we find that this procedure works extremely well (usually to better than 0.1% precision) over a wide range of the parameters.\nIn Fig. 15, we illustrate the dependence of \ud835\udc431Desc for the singlet and triplet lines on \ud835\udc47e, \ud835\udf02c and \ud835\udf0fS for the standard value of \ud835\udefcEM. The temperature dependence decreases with \ud835\udf02c, as expected from the fact for \ud835\udf02c \u2192 0 the dependence on \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc47e) and \ud835\udc47e drops out of the expression in Eq. (8). For the triplet line, even when \ud835\udf02c ' 1 a significant dependence on \ud835\udc47e can be observed, while for the singlet case the corresponding curves become practically independent of\ud835\udc47e. As we will see below (Fig. 16), the escape probability of the triplet line is practically independent of \ud835\udc4e, such that the main temperature dependence only enters through \ud835\udf02c = \ud835\udf02c \u0394\ud835\udf08D/\ud835\udf080, while for the singlet line also \ud835\udc4e matters.\nAt \ud835\udf0fS 1, a quasi-linear scaling with \ud835\udf0fS is found (see Fig. 15), which directly follows when performing a Taylor-series expansion of Eq.

The only explicit dependence enters due to modifications of \ud835\udc4e. This is shown in Fig. (16). The singlet line exhibits noticeable changes for all shown values of \ud835\udf02c, while the triplet line is practically independent of \ud835\udc4e. This arises from the much smaller typical value of \ud835\udc4e for the triplet line and associated dominance of the Doppler core in the escape problem (see Fig. B.1 of Rubi\u00f1o-Mart\u00edn et al. 2008, for some illustrations of the integrand), which makes the escape problem for the triplet line less dependent on \ud835\udc4e.

As in Sec. 3.2.2, the fiducial value is compared to the two cases with \u0394\ud835\udefcEM/\ud835\udefcEM = \u00b1 0.1. In Fig. 17, the modified recombination lines are shown for HI (top), HeI (middle) and HeII (bottom). For hydrogen, the net impact of a larger \ud835\udefcEM is an amplification on the spectral features. We find that the high frequency peaks roughly change as \u221d \ud835\udefc2EM. Given\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\nthe primary recombination mechanism described in Sec. 3.1, with an acceleration of recombination expected for increasing \ud835\udefcEM, this makes sense; however, the detailed effects are quite subtle, where the impact on recombination is a complicated combination of line enhancements versus broadening. The latter leads to a redistribution of photons across the CRR and hence reduction of emission in some bands, with the width being directly linked to the relative duration of the recombination process. We also note that at low frequencies (not shown here), we do not see any significant change in the amplitude of the distortion, aside from some modifications from the free-free absorption process. Given that at low frequencies no spectral features are visible, this shows that a net redistribution of the emission in different bands occurs while leaving the total number of photons added nearly constant. Thus visible changes to the CRR only appear where individual lines can be identified.\nFor the helium lines, additional complications arise from the changes to the importance of electrons scattering. With increasing \ud835\udefcEM the effective scattering \ud835\udc66-parameter increases and so does the smearing of the lines. This is indeed visible in the HeII spectrum. We can notice that the HeII lines remain almost constant in amplitude but mainly change their width. This highlights that for the total\nspectrum it is hard to understand how the effects propagate into the final CRR just from the simple scaling of variables given above.\nAn increase in \ud835\udefcEM also causes a small net drift of the main lines for all species of distortion to lower frequencies. However, the effect is much smaller than what would be guessed from the energy scaling of the transition frequencies, \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 \u221d \ud835\udefc2EM. In real-\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\nity, the recombination process also occurs at roughly \ud835\udefc2EM times higher redshifts, leaving the ratio \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57/(1 + \ud835\udc67em) roughly constant for individual transitions. Nevertheless, the positions of the lines are tracers of when the recombination process happened. Interestingly, the shifts are more noticeable for the HI and HeI contributions than for HeII, for which line broadening effects seem to be more pronounced.\nFor larger \ud835\udefcEM we can also see added spectral peaks emerging. Examples are at \ud835\udf08 ' 80GHz and \ud835\udf08 ' 160GHz in the HI contribution. This has to do with the way the emission from various transitions overlaps and compensate each other, partially canceling or interfering constructively. For HeII (lower part of Fig. 17), larger values of \ud835\udefcEM more strongly smear the overall shape, with peaks being compressed and troughs being raised. In this case, we also notice a deterioration of the peak feature at \ud835\udf08 ' 450GHz, indicating modifications in the relative importance of various transitions, here related to the HeII Balmer lines.\nWhen all three atomic species are combined into a single distortion, the result is as shown in Fig. 18. Here the more intricate variations due to helium are smeared out by the larger magnitude signal from hydrogen, as was the case for early dark energy. However, this still provides richer structure on the inter-level emission bumps throughout the profile. This should generally allow one to distinguish \ud835\udefcEM variations in the CRR from other parameters using high resolution spectrometers.\nFor comparison, in Fig. 18 we also show the same spectra but for changes to \ud835\udc5ae. Although we have doubled the variation to \u0394\ud835\udc5ae/\ud835\udc5ae,0 = \u00b10.2, one can see that the changes of the total CRR are a lot smaller. By decreasing the electron mass one can observe a small overall enhancements of the spectral features. Therefore, \ud835\udc5ae will be harder to detect with a CMB spectrometer, with the largest response being visible at about ' 1 THz. We confirmed numerically that this has to do with the precise interplay of the emissivities and energies scaling, leaving the main effect to be a small change in the width of the spectral features. This directly contrasts with the influence that \ud835\udc5ae has on the CMB anisotropies as previously discussed in the literature (Hart & Chluba 2018, 2020). However, here the observable is related to the Thomson visibility function, which has a different non-canceling dependence on \ud835\udc5ae."

With the full deviations implicitly found in the interaction rates and the conductance variations (see Sec. 3.1), the changes that will primarily affect the Lyman, Balmer and higher order series will be present in the \ud835\udefcEM derivatives and less obvious in the \ud835\udc47CMB responses. As originally shown in Chluba & Sunyaev (2008), the generic effect from changing\ud835\udc47CMB is to shift the peaks of the CRR back and forth. Therefore, the interaction rates have a more complex effect from variations in \ud835\udefcEM."

For this we use the same noise profiles as described in Sec. 2.3 for Voyage 2050. Specifically, we will use the standard Voyage setup (Voyage 2050) and 50\u00d7 higher sensitivity (Voyage 2050++) to highlight the potential of future CMB spectrometers as a cosmological probe.\nThe comparison for Voyage 2050++ for \u039bCDM and adding \ud835\udefcEM is shown in the contours of Fig. 21. When varying \ud835\udefcEM the contours show a general broadening once the fine structure constant is added to the analysis. This softens the direct degeneracy between \ud835\udf14c and \ud835\udc41eff that we have previously discussed in this paper and previous works (Hart et al. 2020), transferring it to correlations with \ud835\udefcEM. However, the contours are not altered to a great amount in general; this is owed to the largely distinctive and unique spectral patterns associated with \ud835\udefcEM that we have discussed in Sec. 3.3. The standard deviations for this configuration with \ud835\udefcEM are shown in Table 2. From the data in this table, and the previous findings from Hart et al. (2020), we can see that \ud835\udf14c and \ud835\udc41eff are far too weakly constrained by Voyage 2050 alone, requiring higher sensitivity and complimentary probes to reach competitive results.8 As \ud835\udefcEM is included in the analysis, we can see from Table 2 that the errors on the parameters do not expand, save for a ' 19% increase for \ud835\udf14c.\nFor \ud835\udc5ae, the situation is slightly more complicated as the contours in Fig. 22 show. Both \ud835\udf14c and \ud835\udc41eff distributions are broadened and the effect from \ud835\udc5ae all but removes the \ud835\udf14c \u2212 \ud835\udc41eff degeneracy. In this case, the co-varying power is passed to the \ud835\udc5ae-\ud835\udc41eff relation, as the \ud835\udc5ae variations partially emulate an acceleration in the radiation\n8 We ask the reader to bear in mind that the errors for \ud835\udc41eff in Table 2 and Table 3 are indeed large compared to modern probes; however, they are quoted here to underpin the potential of CRR oriented spectrometers when the sensitivity can be reached.\nera. This is corroborated by the results in Table 3 where the error on \ud835\udf14c increased by 66% and \ud835\udc41eff by 36% for Voyage 2050.\nWe note that none of the other \u039bCDM parameters matter for the CRR and that the value of \ud835\udc47CMB will be measured to very high precision using the blackbody part. Of course the precludes cosmologies with varying temperature-redshift relation, which would run into several other issues of course (Chluba 2014)."

Specifically, we can do this by adding the Fisher matrix \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 to the inverse covariance matrix from Planck : \ud835\udeba\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 . Note that in this case the parameters coming from Planck (\ud835\udf03MC, \ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udc34s, \ud835\udc5bs) have a zero contribution in the CRR Fisher matrix; we are simply investigating how the parameter errors change as the covariances are influenced.\nAdding different mission configurations with Planck data for variations of \ud835\udefcEM are shown in Fig. 23. The standard \u039bCDM parameters associated with the the power spectrum amplitude and reionisation era, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udf0f have been omitted from the plots as the addition of CRR does not alter their values significantly. The configuration for the highest sensitivity is Voyage 2050++ since this is the level of sensitivity in our setup where the errors start to markedly improve compared to Planck. In our forecasts with \ud835\udefcEM and \ud835\udc5ae, we have only included the two energy densities: \ud835\udf14b and \ud835\udf14c as added free parameters since we have not included chains where \ud835\udc4cp and \ud835\udc41eff co-vary with the fundamental constants. Responses in \ud835\udc3b0 are so small in the CRR they have not been included here (see Hart et al. 2020, for more details).\nFirstly, the Planck contours are shown as yellow dashed lines, with the addition of Voyage 2050 data in dark purple. The contours\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\nfor Planck are almost identical whether one includes Voyage 2050 or omits it in the case of \ud835\udefcEM. However, there are some small shifts in the maximum likelihood positions. This is reflected in Table 4 where the values of the errors do not change for this configuration either. When we look at a higher precision Voyage 2050++ configuration, the errors start to diminish as shown in Fig. 23. Including \ud835\udefcEM with Planck +Voyage 2050++ forecasts, the finer spectral shape of \ud835\udefcEM is complimented by the much higher sensitivity and the error on \ud835\udefcEM is significantly reduced. Some gains can even be seen for other parameters like \ud835\udc5bs due to a reduction of the \ud835\udefcEM-100 \ud835\udf03MC contours.\nThe degeneracy of\ud835\udefcEM with 100 \ud835\udf03MC is not removed; however, since the parameter degeneracies with \ud835\udf03 are not altered by other parameters, the correlations remain similar (correlation between the parameters \ud835\udf09\ud835\udf03,\ud835\udefc = 0.99 \u2192 0.91). This has been highlighted in Fig. 24. When the high precision Voyage 2050++ configuration is considered, even with latent degeneracies, the error on \ud835\udefcEM is diminished to \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udefcEM ' 0.0005, which is ' 5 times smaller than Planck alone and also another factor of ' 2 better than the Voyage 2050++ spectrometer alone. Note that for CMB anisotropy measurements, the addition of BAO data did not change the error on \ud835\udefcEM in previous studies (Hart & Chluba 2020).\nConversely, the influence of \ud835\udc5ae has a more substantial effect. In Planck 2018, the errors for \ud835\udc5ae are much larger since the marginalised result is \ud835\udc5ae/\ud835\udc5ae,0 = 0.888 \u00b1 0.059 as shown in Table 5. In particular, the non-zero off-set with respect to the standard electron mass helped alleviate the Hubble tension (Hart & Chluba 2020). However, already when we combine Voyage 2050 with Planck, we see the error in \ud835\udc5ae to cascade down and move to the fiducial value: the density covariances with \ud835\udc5ae are limited by the spectrometer. The error in \ud835\udc5ae is already ' 3 times smaller in this case, allowing one to contest the non-zero shift in the value for \ud835\udc5ae seen from Planck alone. Primarily, the error on \ud835\udc5ae in Planck is caused by the geometric degeneracy between \ud835\udc5ae and 100 \ud835\udf03MC/\ud835\udc3b0. Since the changes in \u0394\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udf08 caused by variations of \ud835\udc5ae are distinct from any associated with the Hubble constant, this separates the variations of the two parameters and begins to remove the correlation. When we further look at Planck with Voyage 2050++, the error drops by a another factor of ' 7. Evidently, this very futuristic version of the Voyage 2050 spectrometer will give unprecedented\nprecision on \ud835\udc5ae which may help rule out a possible VFC origin of the Hubble tension. We note that adding Voyage 2050+ to Planck (not shown here) did not lead to significant additional improvements on \ud835\udc5ae since the gains on other CMB parameters did eat up some of the gains from the increased spectrometer sensitivity.\nWe also mention that in our forecasts we have not allowed for time-dependent variations of the fundamental constants. This had interesting effects on the CMB anisotropies and could be independently constrained (Hart & Chluba 2018, 2021). Here, we have three emission eras from each of the individual atomic species (Sunyaev & Chluba 2009). This means one could expect the interesting interatomic interplay to manifest in the CRR and even be constrainable with future CMB spectrometers. However, a more detailed analysis of this problem is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317"

            "text": "In this work, we studied the effects of EDE and VFC on the CRR. We illustrated how the various model parameters affect the CRR and provided simple forecasts for the expected sensitivities of various CMB spectrometer concepts.\nThe effect of EDE solely enters through changes of the expansion rate in the pre-recombination era. The associated effects on the three recombination phases depend on the details of the underlying model-parameters. For radiation-like dilution, all three recombination contributions can be modified, while for significantly faster dilution, the responses remain more localized in redshift. These effects in principle allow probing EDE models with spectrometers comparable to Voyage 2050++. Since we do not have access to chains from Planckfor EDE model, we have not explored how a combination with a spectrometer could improve the constraints. However, we do anticipate significant gains but leave a more detailed analysis to future work.\nFor VFC models, the recombination physics is directly affected, leaving distinct responses in the CRR that in principle again allow testing various phases in the pre-recombination era. The leading order effects for variations of \ud835\udefcEM are a change in the amplitude of the CRR and smaller shift in the position of the recombination lines. The latter effect appears degenerate to changes in the value of the CMB monopole temperature; however, as we show here, the responses are distinct, in principle allowing to distinguish the two (see Fig. 18) directly with the CRR. For variations of\ud835\udc5ae, we find the responses to be much smaller with significant cancellations between various effects (see lower panel of Fig. 18).\nOur simple forecasts show that the CRR provides the principle possibility to test EDE and VFC models. However, futuristic spectrometer sensitivities are required to derive independent but competitive constraints. By combining with CMB anisotropy measurements, significant improvements can be found. For example, Voyage 2050 with Planckcould improve the allowed error on variations of\ud835\udc5ae by a factor of more than' 3 and also remove a large part of the geometric degeneracy allowed by Planckalone (see Fig. 25). This might shed new light on the origin of the Hubble tension, allowing us to rule out a VFC cause.\nA more comprehensive forecast, that combines the CRR responses with other cosmological probes could improve the forecasts, potentially allowing to distinguish between various scenarios. The addition of foregrounds will also be important. However, in contrast to \ud835\udf07 and \ud835\udc66 type distortions (Abitbol et al. 2017), the CRR does not suffer as strongly from foregrounds (Hart et al. 2020), such that the main conclusions should not change as much. In addition, EDE models can simultaneously create VFC effects, which then poten-\ntially enhance the sensitivity of the CRR to the underlying physics model. An exploration of these possibilities is left to future work."
