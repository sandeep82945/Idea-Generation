    "abstractText": "To the Editor: An early-term neonate with low birth weight (1700 grams) was referred to our hospital on day 6 of life with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). On day 17 of life, she had a massive pulmonary hemorrhage and she was put on peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). A bedside PDA ligation was done. She was discharged home with no evidence of ROP and intracranial hemorrhage. Neonatal ECMO is a life-saving procedure for critically ill neonates suffering from a potentially reversible disease, causing severe cardiac and/or respiratory failure and refractory-to-maximal conventional management [1]. This was one-of-a-kind case where peripheral VA-ECMO and PDA ligation were done bedside in NICU in a LBW neonate following an acute life-threatening event of pulmonary hemorrhage and cardiorespiratory failure. This neonate initially presented with severe PAH, and treatment was initiated. As pulmonary pressures reduced, she developed biventricular failure and pulmonary edema due to large PDA. As a life-saving measure, bedside peripheral VA-ECMO was performed after confirming an unhindered circle of Willis, ruling out coagulopathy and structural heart defect, and subsequently, surgical PDA ligation was done. Although 2 kg is generally considered to be the lower limit, infants small for gestational age but of 34 wk should not be excluded [2]. This case illustrated that the use of an appropriately sized cannula was of paramount importance in the success of VA-ECMO. This case also highlighted the point that, while treating pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary vasodilators, the possibility of pulmonary edema due to hemodynamically significant PDA has to be kept in mind. In India, ECMO in such a small baby with intact survival has not been reported till date. With adequate expertise and resources, peripheral VA-ECMO can be used bedside and aid in the survival of critical neonates with cardiorespiratory failure not responding to conventional treatment.",
