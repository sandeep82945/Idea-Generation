    "abstractText": "Passive transport of molecules through nanopores is characterized by the interaction of molecules with pore internal walls and by a general crowding effect due to the constricted size of the nanopore itself, which limits the presence of molecules in its interior. The molecule\u2013pore interaction is treated within the diffusion approximation by introducing the potential of mean force and the local diffusion coefficient for a correct statistical description. The crowding effect can be handled within the Markov state model approximation. By combining the two methods, one can deal with complex free energy surfaces taking into account crowding effects. We recapitulate the equations bridging the two models to calculate passive currents assuming a limited occupancy of the nanopore in a wide range of molecular concentrations. Several simple models are analyzed to clarify the consequences of the model. Eventually, a biologically relevant case of transport of an antibiotic molecule through a bacterial porin is used to draw conclusions (i) on the effects of crowding on transport of small molecules through biological channels, and (ii) to demonstrate its importance for modelling of cellular transport.",

Specialized protein complexes provide the necessary modulation to the number of transported molecules (the flux/current) and their molecular characteristic (the selectivity). The main objective of a controlled and selective transport is to keep the integrity of the internal environment (membrane potential, concentrations of solutes, pH), key for a correct functioning of cells.\nThe main general and simple selection rule to achieve controlled transport is based on constriction of the pore size, where an entropic barrier prevents fast entry of molecules. The entropic barrier can be modulated independently by electrostatic and other specific chemical interactions. In biology, a typical example is provided by porins, beta-barrel proteins with an internal water-filled pore. In porins, the diffusive transport of molecules/ions/water is modulated by a constricted shape created by one or more loops folded internally andwith different degrees of flexibility [4\u20137]. Investigating the transport of particles under confinement is thus of primary importance to unveil and rationalize the mechanism of biological nanopores functioning [8,9]. At the same time, such biological complexes are a source of inspiration for the development of artificial pores with potential technological applications, such as in molecular sensing [10\u201313].\nRecently, the necessity to rationalize and predict the accumulation of molecules in Gram-negative bacteria has emerged as prerequisite to the development of new effective drugs [14,15]. For many small and polar molecules, their accumulation is obtained via a subtle balance between passive diffusion through porins (in and out) and active efflux (out) [16]. Experimentally the accumulation seems not to follow neither simple Fick\u2019s law kinetics for entry nor the Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics for extrusion [17,18], showing a nonlinear behavior. The Fick\u2019s law was first introduced to describe the free diffusion of noninteracting  * Corresponding author: Igor V. Bodrenko, CNR/IOM, Section of Cagliari, c/o Department of Physics, S.P.

Thus, a proper treatment of saturation due to the interaction of the solute molecules is necessary for the correct use of Fick\u2019s law in a more general and complex model to understand and predict accumulation in finite volumes [15].\nThe passive transport of molecules through membrane pores is driven by the gradient of the chemical potential and can often be described within the diffusion approximation by using the over-damped Brownian dynamics or the Smoluchowski equation [19]. This model has been widely used for over a century in the form of Nernst\u2013Plank equation for electrodiffusion. It is also behind important classical concepts of membrane physiology such as the membrane potential and current (Goldman\u2013Hodgkin \u2013Katz equation). This is a linear theory that assumes the linear dependence of the molecular flux through the pore on the concentration of the molecules and explains the generalized Fick\u2019s law of the permeability through membranes. The diffusion model also assumes that molecules do not interact with each other inside pores. In other words, it is valid at low concentrations when the probability to have two or more molecules in the pore at the same time is negligible. At high substrate concentrations, especially in the case of favorable pore\u2013substrate interactions, the probability to have two substrate molecules trying to occupy the pore at the same time is not negligible. That leads to the slower growth of the diffusion current vs the substrate concentration, and finally to the saturation, i.e., the independence of the passive current on the concentration.\nThe saturation can be observed in single-channel electrophysiology (SCE) [20], where the presence of a molecule in the pore is detected via the observations of the corresponding blockages of the ionic current through the pore [21] or via the analysis of the ion current fluctuations at various concentration gradient [20]. The SCE data have been analyzed in terms of the Markov state model, [22], which assumes one or more binding sites for the molecule in the pore and uses the master equations, a discrete Markov process (Markov chain)model, to trace the time course of the occupation probabilities of the binding sites. The simplest two-state Markovmodel assumes that, at the maximum, one particle at a time can occupy the channel (binding site). It can describe both the linearity with the concentration and the saturated behavior. The parameters of the Markov state model, the transition rates between the states, in principle, can be obtained from the experiment (e.g., electrophysiology). In many cases, it is impossible to calculate directly the transport of molecules through nanopores by using the all-atommolecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations as the characteristic times (more than milliseconds) are beyond the capabilities of modern high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures\nHowever, thanks to the use of sophisticated algorithms for accelerating sampling, it is feasible to obtain the free energy surface for the transport of amolecule through a nanopore as well as the diffusion coefficient by using MD simulations and 1\u2013100microseconds long trajectories [23]. This gives the necessary input data for the diffusion model. In the present work, we discuss in detail how to exploit the free energy surface and the diffusion coefficient of the 1D diffusion model to obtain the rate constants of the corresponding Markov state model. Only by combining the two models, one can obtain the passive current of molecules through pores as function of the gradient concentration (or gradient of chemical potential), which can be accessed experimentally, for example, by the reversal potential method [23], thus also helping the interpretation of experimental results.\nThe mathematical grounds and physical applications of the continuous and discrete Markov processes have been known for decades if not centuries. However, the applications to the passive transport of molecules through nanopores bridging the timescales from the diffusion (psns) to the Markov state (us-ms) are relatively recent, see, e.g., [24,25], and are mainly focused on the theoretical development based on the mean first passage time (MFPT) concept and to the analysis of simplified analytic models. Here, we focus on passive transport through biological nanopores within the bridged multiscale approach \u2013 from all-atom MD simulation to the 1D diffusion and two state Markov model (MD-1DD-2MS).\nThis article is organized as follows. First, we recapitulate the necessary results of the 1D diffusion theory and of the Markov state models. Then, we derive the expression of the kinetic rate constants in terms of the free energy profile and the diffusion coefficient, in original way, without the use of the MFPT concept. We discuss the qualitative properties of the theory on simple analytic models of free energy barriers and binding site and then consider, as a more realistic application, the transport of biologically related molecules through bacterial porins."

Often, it is sufficient to consider only one slow coordinate, e.g., the one characterizing the position of the molecule along the pore axis or the reaction path. The corresponding one-dimensional Fokker\u2013Planck equation (FPE) for the probability density of molecule\u2019s coordinate, ( )\u03d5 x t, , is reduced to the Smoluchowski diffusion-drift equation,\n\u239c \u239f ( ) ( )\u239b\n\u239d\n( ) ( ) ( ) \u239e\n\u23a0\n\u2202\n\u2202 =\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202 +\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u03d5 x t t x D x \u03d5 x t x \u03d5 x t kT U x x , , , , (1)\nwhere k stands for Boltzmann\u2019s constant, T is the temperature, and ( )D x is the position-dependent diffusion coefficient. ( )U x is called the potential of mean force (PMF) as it generates the mean drift force acting onto the Brownian particle, ( ) ( )= \u2212 /f x U x xd d . The difference between the PMF values at two points, x and =x 0, equals the minimal thermodynamic (reversible) work required for moving the molecule from point =x 0 to x, ( ) =U x ( ) ( )\u222b \u2032 \u2032 =f x x W xd x\n0 min ; here, we set ( ) =U 0 0. According to the fundamental principles of thermodynamics [28], the minimal work required to change a parameter of a system while keeping it in the thermodynamic equilibrium, e.g., maintaining constant pressure, p, and temperature, T , is equal to the corresponding difference of the appropriate thermodynamic potential of the total system (particle plus medium), e.g., the Gibbs free energy ( ) ( )= \u2212W x G x p T, ,min ( ) ( )= \u2261G x p T G x0, , \u0394 ; therefore, ( ) ( )=U x G x\u0394 . Equation (1) has a Boltzmann-type equilibrium (zero-flux) solution, determined by the PMF and independent on the diffusion coefficient,\n( ) ( ( ) )= \u2212 /\u03d5 x c U x kTexp ,eq 0 (2)\nwhere c0 is a constant dependent on the boundary conditions (the concentration of the molecules outside the pore).\nAs far as the PMF, ( )U x , is used to characterize the distribution of the particles in the thermodynamic equilibrium, the timescales of the fluctuations of the variables are not important. The description is equivalent to the classical Gibbs distribution. When one uses the PMF, ( )U x , in the diffusion-drift equation to treat the system out of the thermodynamic equilibrium, the adiabatic separation of x from all other degrees of freedom must be assumed, in general. Fortunately, this very strong condition may be softened and the validity of the Smoluchowski equation may be extended if one introduces an appropriate\nmodified position-dependent diffusion coefficient, ( )D x [29\u201332]. Still, it is worth to remind that diffusion is a time-average concept with respect to the all-atom dynamics. It assumes Maxwell\u2019s distribution in the momentum space, so that the diffusion time scale is much larger than the corresponding momentum relaxation time of the particle, \u226b = /t \u03c4 DM kTp , where D is the diffusion constant and M is the mass. For a typical biologically related small molecule ( =M 250 Da, = /D 1 nm ns2 ), at room temperature, one obtains =\u03c4 0.1 psp .\nIn the practically important case of the steady-state, the particle distribution is time independent, ( ) ( )=\u03d5 x t \u03d5 x, , but the diffusion current, I , is nonzero and depends on boundary conditions. In particular, if the molecular bulk concentration on one side of the pore (cis side, at =x 0) is cC and on the other side of the pore (trans side, at =x L) is cT and the diffusion current is determined by the Kramerstype formula [26]:\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( )\n( ) ( )\n( )\u222b =\n\u2212 I S c cexp exp\nexp ,D\nU kT\nU L kT\nL U x kT x D x\nC 0 T\n0 d\n(3)\nwhere S is the cross section of the channel at the entrance of the pore (the active surface of the pore). The average number of (noninteracting) diffusing molecules in the pore reads:\n\u239b \u239d ( ) ( ) \u239e \u23a0\n\u239b\n\u239d\n\u239c \u239c ( )\n\u239e\n\u23a0\n\u239f \u239f\n( ) ( ) ( )\n\u222b\n\u222b\n= \u2212 \u2212\n\u00d7 \u2212 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2212\nN U x U kT\nSc I D x\nx x\nexp 0\nexp d , d .\nc\nL\nx U x U kT\n0\nC\n0\n0 (4)\nFor small numbers, \u226aN 1c (at low concentrations cC), this quantity has the meaning of the probability to find a single molecule in the channel (channel occupancy), =q Nc. For the specific cases, equation (3) has been known\nand practically used for many decades, e.g., the Fick\u2019s law for the diffusive current through membranes driven by the gradient of the concentration, the Goldman\u2013Hodgkin\u2013Katz equation for ionic current through membrane driven by the gradient of the electric potential and ion concentration difference, etc. The formula for the diffusion current is modified in the case when the radiation boundary conditions are more appropriate [33], or for a single particle in a periodic PMF driven by a constant force [19,34,35].\nEquation (3) demonstrates that the PMF enters the current in the exponent, while the diffusion coefficient does only linearly: the dependence of the diffusion\ncurrent on the PMF is stronger. In many cases, the diffusion coefficient can be effectively taken as a constant, ( ) \u2248 \u2217D x D . If the PMF creates a large barrier in the constriction region, ( ) \u226bU x kTc , the integral in (3) may be restricted to a short interval, x\u0394 , around the barrier position, and the diffusion current reads:\n( ) ( ( ) )= \u2212 \u2212 / /\u2217I S c c D U x kT xexp \u0394 .cC T (5)\nThis latter concept has been successfully applied recently to model the permeation of antibiotics through outer membrane channels of Gram-negative bacteria [7,36].\nThe central input quantities of the model, ( )U x and ( )D x , may be determined microscopically by using individual trajectories from all-atom simulations including, e.g., the pore, the membrane, the solvent, and the molecules, see, e.g., [37\u201340]. For large molecules and strong interaction, the timescale for the particle to cross the pore increases and plain all-atom simulations may become unable to achieve statistically convergent results. Then, the enhanced sampling methods (e.g., the umbrella sampling [41] or the metadynamics [42,43]) may be utilized. But even when using the enhanced sampling, the allatom approach is still often computationally demanding as multi-microseconds long trajectories may be required [23,44\u201346]."

            "text": "The Markov state kinetic model of the pore\u2013molecule interaction, used, e.g., for the analysis of the channel gating in the electophysiology [47], starts with a set of states defined by different ionic conductance levels of the channel (the \u201cbound states\u201d) due to the presence of substrate molecules. The transitions between these states are assumed to be much faster than the corresponding residence times. The ground state is the open-channel state (optionally, several) without any molecule inside. The transitions between the states are described as a discrete Markov process determined by the corresponding rate constants \u2013 the target parameters describing the pore\u2013molecule interaction kinetics [22].\nHere, we consider a one-binding-site (two-states) Markov model of the channel, the extension to the manystate model is straightforward.\n( ) [ ] ( )\u21c4 \u21c4cis transC binding site T . (6)\nLet p p,o b are the probabilities to have the open channel and a single molecule in the pore, correspondingly. In the Markov state model, one introduces the transition rates, \u03bb \u03bb,ob bo, between the two states of the pore occupation states, and the simultaneous rate equations:\n= \u2212 +p \u03bb p \u03bb p\u02d9 ,o ob o bo b (7)\n= \u2212 +p \u03bb p \u03bb p\u02d9 .b bo b ob o (8)\nAdditional normalization condition, + =p p 1o b , reflects the physical assumption that only a single molecule a time can stay in the pore. Then, one introduces the kinetic rates, koffC , koffT , for the transition of the particle from the binding site to the \u201ccis\u201d and the \u201ctrans\u201d sides of the channel, respectively, so that = +\u03bb k kbo offC offT . Also, one assumes that the \u201ccis\u201d and \u201ctrans\u201d compartments are large reservoirs keeping the molar concentrations of the molecules at the sides of the channel invariant, respectively, cC and cT. Thus, one can write down, c kC onC and c kT onT , for the transition of the particle from the \u201ccis\u201d side and from the \u201ctrans\u201d side, respectively, onto the binding site in the channel, so that = +\u03bb c k c kob C onC T onT . Besides, we define the following quantities, which can be determined in the electophysiology:\n= + = =k k k K k k K k k ; ; .off offC offT C on C\noff\nT on T\noff (9)\nBelow, we summarize necessary results from the twostate Markov model in the steady-state [22,47,48]. If the particles are added on the both sides at the concentrations, respectively, cT and cC, the steady-state probability to find a molecule in the channel reads,\n= + + + p c K c K c K c K 1 .b\nT T C C\nT T C C (10)\nThe net current of molecules through the pore reads,\n( ) ( )= \u2212 \u2212\n= \u2212\n+ +\n\u2192I c c p k p c k c k K c k K\nc K c K\n, 1\n1 .\nb bC T C T off T T on T\nC off T C T off C T\nT T C C\n(11)\nWith the aforementioned definition, the current is positive for the net transport from cis to trans, and it is negative for the opposite direction.\nFrom the aforementioned results, and from the general requirements of the zero net particle current, in the case of the symmetric bulk solution on the sides of the channel (equal concentrations, no electric field gradient, etc.), ( ) =\u2192I c c, 0C T , one arrives at the detailed balance condition for the transition rates,\n=k k k k .onC offT onT offC (12)\nThus, one finally obtains,\n( )\n( )( )\n= +\n\u2212\n+ +\n= +\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192I K K K K c c k c K c K\nK K K K k p c c\n1\n1 .b\nC T T C\nT C\nC T off\nT T C C\nT C\nT C off C T\n(13)\nEquation (13) shows that the molecular pore-translocation current obeys Fick\u2019s law for small concentrations only, + \u226ac K c K 1T T C C ,\n\u2223 ( )= +\n\u2212\u2192 \u2192I K K\nK K k c c ,c cC T , 0\nT C\nT C off C TC T (14)\n\u2223 = +\u2192p c K c K .b c c, 0 T T C CC T (15)\nIn the opposite case of large concentrations, in contrast with the diffusion approximation, the molecular current saturates and reaches its maximum, I max.\n= +\n=\n= +\n=\n\u2192\n\u2192\nI K K K k k I K K K k k .

In general, the translocation current depends on the side of application of the concentration gradient,\n( ) ( )\u2260\u2192 \u2192I c c I c c, , .C T C T T C T C (17)\nIn the case of asymmetric solvent on cis and trans sides, due, e.g., to the different solvent activity or an applied electric potential for charged molecules, the definition of\nthe in-rates should be modified, ( )= +\u03bb c kexpob \u03c8 kT C on CC\n( )c kexp \u03c8 kT T on TT . The constant ( )= \u2212\u03c8 \u03bc kT xln is the differ-\nence between the chemical potential of the particle and the logarithm of its molar fraction; it contains both the activity and the applied electric potential. The detailed balance condition, (12), remains, but the net translocation current becomes \u03c8-dependent (compared with equation (3) for 1D diffusion),\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n= +\n\u00d7\n\u2212\n+ +\n\u2192I c \u03c8 c \u03c8 K K\nK K k\nc c\nc K c K\n, ; ,\nexp exp\n1 exp exp .\n\u03c8 kT\n\u03c8 kT\n\u03c8 kT\n\u03c8 kT\nC T C C T T\nT C\nT C off\nC T\nC C T T\nC T\nC T\n(18)\nInterestingly, the maximum current at high concentration is given by the same equations (16).\nBridging 1D diffusion and the Markov state models\nTo connect the kinetic rates of the Markov state model with the PMF and the diffusion coefficient, one can consider the low concentration limit, where the bothmodels are linear with the concentration. Similar arguments have been used by other authors, see, e.g., [24,25]. We also assume that the solute at concentration c is added from one side only, and the PMF has same value at the ends, ( ) ( )= =U U L0 0. The linear-regime probability to find a particle in the channel when added only from the trans and only from the cis side, respectively, can be defined as follows:\n( ) ( )= =q c cK q c cK; .T T C C (19)\nThe linear-regime particle current through the channel when added to one side (the same for trans and cis) at concentration gradient c, reads,\n( ) = =I c cK k cK k .D C offT T offC (20)\nQuantities ( )q cT , ( )q cC and ( )I cD can be calculated within the diffusion model by using equations (3) and (4). Thus, by defining the following quantities:\n\u239b \u239d ( ) ( ) \u239e \u23a0 \u222b= \u2212 \u2212R U x U kT xexp 0 d ,\nL\n0\n(21)\n( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\n\u222b=\n\u2212\nQ D x\nx exp d , L U x U kT\n0\n0\n(22)\n( ) \u239b\n\u239d\n( ) \u239e\n\u23a0\n( ) ( )\n\u222b \u222b= \u2212 \u2032\n\u2032T D x U x kT\nx x exp exp d d , L U x kT x\n0\n0 0\n(23)\n\u239b \u239d ( ) \u239e \u23a0 ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u222b \u222b= \u2212 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nT U x kT D x\nx xexp exp d d , L x U x kT 1\n0 0\n(24)\nsatisfying = +RQ T T0 1, one finds,\n( ) ( ) = = = =K q c c S T Q K q c c S T Q ; ,T T 1 C C 0 (25)\n( )\n( )\n( ) ( ) = = = =k I c q c T k I c q c T 1 ; 1 ,D DoffT C 0 off C T 1\n(26)\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) =\n+ = + =k I c q c q c q c q c T T T T RQ T T ,Doff T C T C 0 1 0 1 0 1 (27)\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) =\n+ =k I c q c q c q c S R T ,DonT\nC T\nC 0\n(28)\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) =\n+ =k I c q c q c q c S R T .DonC\nC T\nT 1\n(29)\nThe aforementioned formulas connect the Markov state model with the diffusion approximation. T T,0 1 quantities are equal to the mean first passage times defined in refs [24,25].\nThe translocation current and the channel occupancy at higher concentrations can be calculated by using Markov state model results, equations (10) and (13). In particular, if the molecules are added from one side only, one finds,\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) = + = + p c q c q c p c q c q c1 ; 1 ,b bC\nC\nC C\nT\nT (30)\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) = + = + \u2192 \u2192I c I c q c I c I c q c1 ; 1 .D DC T C T C T (31)\nIt is worth to note again that the two-state Markov state is a time average concept with respect to the continuous diffusion approximation. It assumes that the average time spent by the molecule in each of the states is much larger than the average diffusion time required to cross the barrier between the states. The latter can be estimated as = /\u03c4 l D\u0394D 2 , where l\u0394 is the characteristic width of the barrier. Therefore, the conditions of the applicability of the 1DD-2MS bridging discussed earlier read,\n= \u226b\u03c4 k l D 1 \u0394 ,res off 2 (32)\n= \u226b\u03c4 ck l D 1 \u0394 ,incis on C 2 (33)\n= \u226b\u03c4 ck l D 1 \u0394 .intrans on T 2 (34)\nOnly if the aforementioned conditions are satisfied, one can use the obtained kinetic rates (k k,on off) to trace the nonequilibrium kinetics of the molecule\u2013pore interaction, e.g., the opening and closing time series at it is observed by the electrophysiology.\nHowever, equations (31) for the steady-state tanslocation current are also valid at much weaker conditions. It assumes two main approximations. First, the current, e.g., from cis to trans, is presentable in the form (compared with equation (20)),\n( ) ( )=\u2192I c p c \u03bb ,C T 1C offT (35)\nwhere p1C is the steady-state probability to find a single particle in the channel when added from cis side, and \u03bboffT is the rate of exit from the pore to trans side. This representation is not limited to a 2MS. It is also valid, for\nexample, for any number of Markov states inside the pore, with only one restriction \u2013 the exit rates from all the Markov states to trans side equal either zero or \u03bboffT . The second condition of equation (31) is that not more than one particle at a time can occupy the pore, again with no specific restriction to the 2MS model. If the solute molecules are noninteracting in the solution (ideal solution), the probability to find n molecules in the channel can be given by the Poisson distribution:\n= !\n\u2212 p A q n e ,n n q (36)\nwhere A is the normalization constant, \u2211 =p 1n n , and q is a parameter. If the molecules do not interact also in the pore, n runs from 0 to \u221e, =A 1 and q is the average number of molecules in the pore. In the case of no more than one molecule in the pore, then =n 0, 1 and ( )= / +A e q1q , and one arrives at equation (30) for p1C and equation (31) for the translocation current. Methodologically, this approximation is similar to the introduction of the exclusion volume into the equation of state of ideal gas. It explains two main qualitative effects of the interaction of the molecules in the pore \u2013 the saturation of the translocation current and its asymmetry with respect to the side of addition, both can be observed and studied.\nBy following the latter approach, one can formally extend the model of at maximum N noninteracting molecules in the pore,\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( ( ))\n( ( )) =\n\u2211\n\u2211 + \u2192\n= !\n= !\nI c I c q c1\n.n N q c n\nn N q c\nn\nD C T\n1\n1 C\nn\nn\nC\nC (37)"

            "text": "By representing the PMF as a piece-wise constant function, as shown in Figure 1, one can develop simple analytic models to illustrate (i) how is the molecule\u2013pore interaction, (ii) how the crowding affects the translocation current, and (iii) how the kinetic rates are accessible in the electrophysiology.\nWe will start with a single barrier/binding site inside a pore of length L, the simplest case already discussed by other authors (see, e.g., [24,25]). Then, we will discuss a combination of a barrier and a binding site, eventually concluding with the two-barrier-one-binding-site model (TBOBS), often used to interpret the results in electrophysiology experiments [48].\nAnalytic single barrier/binding site model\nThe barrier (binding site) has the width l\u0394 and is positioned at a distance x0 from the left entry of the pore (cis compartment) and x1 from the right entry side of the pore (trans compartment). Let us suggest that the diffusion coefficient, D, is constant along the channel and the PMF is a rectangular function of magnitude U\u0394 and width l\u0394 , located at =x x0,\n( ) \u239b \u239d\n\u239e \u23a0\n= \u2212U x U x x\nl \u0394 rect \u0394 .0 (38)\nHere, ( ) ( ) ( )= \u2212 \u2212x \u03b8 x \u03b8 xrect 1 is the rectangular functions on interval [ ]0, 1 ; ( )\u03b8 x is the Heaviside step function.\nThe linear diffusion current due to the gradient of concentration c then reads\n( ) ( ) = \u2212 +/ I c c SD L 1 e 1 1 .D U kT l\nL \u0394 \u0394 (39)\nThe molecular current is independent of the rectangle position, x0.

Thus, the obtained transition rate constants do not have real physical meaning.

This approach makes it possible to limit the occupancy for each binding site (not the whole pore), thus enhancing the possibility to studymolecular crowding in the channel.\nEquations (63) and (64) can be interpreted as a diffusion analog of the classical dynamic transition-state theory [26], where ( )/ + \u2212D l l\u0394 \u0394 ratio replaces the frequency prefactor.\nAnalytic two-barriers-one-binding site model\nAmore realistic example is provided by the two-barrier-onebinding-sitemodel, introduced earlier tomodel the transport of metabolites with binding in specific porins [22,48].\nHere, Markov chain mapping formulas, (63)\u2013(66), give (the diffusion coefficient is assumed constant along the pore for simplicity),\n= = +\n\u2212 /\n+\n\u2212 / + +k SD l k SD l\u0394 e ; \u0394 e ,U kT U kTonC 0 on T 1 0 1 (67)\n( ) ( )= = + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 / + \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212 / + \u2212 + \u2212k D l l k D l l\u0394 \u0394 e ; \u0394 \u0394 e .U U kT U U kToffT 1 off C 0 1 0 (68)\nThen, one obtains,\n( ) = + + / + / + +I c c SD l l\u0394 e \u0394 e ,D U kT U kT 0 10 1\n(69)\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n=\n+\n=\n+\n\u2212 \u2212 /\n\u2212 \u2212 /\n\u2212 \u2212 /\n\u2212 /\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+ +\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+ +\nq c SD l\nq c SD l\n\u0394 e 1 e\n,\n\u0394 e 1 e\n.\nU kT\nl l U U kT\nU kT\nl l U U kT\nC \u0394 \u0394\nT \u0394 \u0394\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n(70)\nThe translocation current is given by equations (31).

            "text": "In order to show the potency of the method introduced, we considered a realistic model system, the transport of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (tazobactam) through the main porins expressed in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, OmpF and OmpC. Molecules as tazobactam are used in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics because they bind strongly to beta-lactamase enzyme inhibiting them from modifying chemically antibiotics and thus revert their antibacterial efficacy [50,51]. Today, there is a wide interest in developing such inhibitors to counteract the spreading of resistant pathogens, and one common problem is to predict their transport through porins. By using multiple walkers, metadynamics simulationswe reconstructed the one-dimensional free energy surface for the interaction of tazobactam with the two porins, as done for other inhibitors recently [52]. As we can see in Figure 2, the two FES profiles are a complex combination of local minima and barriers. In particular, we note a main central barrier and some minima on the positive region z (extracellular region), thus reminding the simple model of a barrier and a binding site. By calculating the diffusion current with equation (3) and thus applying equation (31), we obtained the total currents as function of gradient concentration, as reported in Figure 3.\nA comparison of the two currents at constant concentration is not sufficient, as, for example, for the cis to trans current in the left panel of Figure 3. Though the barrier is lower in OmpF, than OmpC, and correspondingly larger the current, in the case of OmpF the saturation occurs before, and at concentrations higher than 10 mM, the current through OmpF becomes lower.\nIt is also interesting to calculate the rate of the cis \u2192 trans and trans \u2192 cis currents, as provided in Figure 4. As we illustrated with in the aforementioned simple examples, the two current are symmetric at low concentration, while at high concentration, there is an asymmetry modulated by the position of minima and barrier, see equations (57), (58), and (31): \u2022 The current trans \u2192 cis is always superior to the cis \u2192 trans, because the highest barrier is on the trans side. \u2022 The presence of minima is responsible for the saturation of the current at high concentration, and the change in current is more drastic on the cis \u2192 trans current because the minima are on the cis side."

            "text": "Our model can be employed to guide and plan experiments till the interpretation of results. A quick look at\nrecent published data shows that kanamycin, a positively charged molecule, is transported through both OmpF/ OmpC [53]. At high negative external potential applied, the association rate in OmpF saturates, contrarily to OmpC. Because kanamycin is a molecule charged positive, a high negative potential applied means to force a large association rate toward the pore, corresponding to the case described here as an increase in the gradient concentration. Interestingly, the obtained results are described by the top panel of Figure 3. Increasing more and more the external potential we would see higher association rate through OmpC than OmpF.\nFurther, the behavior described in Figure 4, an asymmetric transport upon asymmetric addition of molecules in solution, was measured for maltoheaxose through the maltoporin trimeric channel [21]. This sugar molecules has higher association rate when added on the trans side, exactly as for tazobactam through OmpF/OmpC. In that case, the asymmetry is visible already at 0.01 mM concentration, because of the high specificity of the maltoporin channel for sugar molecules."

            "text": "We combined the diffusion equation with the Markov state model to obtain expression for the passive current at any concentrations, thus taking into account the effect of crowding (saturation) on transport. It is demonstrated that, in a biologically relevant case of transport\nof antibiotics through bacterial porins, the transition between Fick\u2019s-low regime (when the influx current is linear with the antibiotic concentration gradient) to the saturated influx current (independent on the concentration) can happen at the 0.1\u20131 mM concentrations. The stronger is the interaction between the molecule and the pore, the lower is the transitional concentration between the two transport regimes. This is particularly important to take into account when a model of wholecell accumulation of molecules is designed and experimental results have to be interpreted [54].\nFurther, some biological conclusion can be drawn by looking at the interaction of particles inside the pores, that reflects the structural features of nanopores. For example, from the free energy profiles presented for the real case, we can conclude that by expressing these channels bacteria maximize the outward current. This means that in case of antibiotics, they can penetrate with a given inward current when present at high concentration on the cis side. Because the periplasmic space has a small volume, a low amount of molecules accumulated with the inward current are sufficient to saturate the interior [15]. However, when the external pressure of concentration disappears on the cis side, the outward current empties the periplasmic space easily. Thus, it is important to keep an almost constant external concentration for antibiotics to be effective on the small periplasmic volume.\nAcknowledgements: MC thanks partial support from the Translocation consortium (http://www.translocation.com) through the IMI Joint Undertaking under grant agreement no. 115525, resources which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union\u2019s seventh framework programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies\u2019 kind contribution.
