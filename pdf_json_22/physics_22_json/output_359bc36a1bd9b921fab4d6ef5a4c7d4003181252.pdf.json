    "abstractText": "The relativistic multipole moments provide a key ingredient to characterize the gravitational field around compact astrophysical objects. They play a crucial role in the description of the orbital evolution of coalescing binary systems and encode valuable information on the nature of the binary\u2019s components, which leaves a measurable imprint in their gravitational-wave emission. We present a new study on the multipolar structure of a class of arbitrarily spinning boson stars with quartic self-interactions in the large coupling limit, where these solutions are expected to be stable. Our results strengthen and extend previous numerical analyses, showing that even for the most compact configurations the multipolar structure deviates significantly from that of a Kerr black hole. We provide accurate data for the multipole moments as functions of the object\u2019s mass and spin, which can be directly used to construct inspiral waveform approximants and to perform parameter estimations and searches for boson star binaries.",

They play a crucial role in the description of the orbital evolution of coalescing binary systems and encode valuable information on the nature of the binary\u2019s components, which leaves a measurable imprint in their gravitational-wave emission. We present a new study on the multipolar structure of a class of arbitrarily spinning boson stars with quartic self-interactions in the large coupling limit, where these solutions are expected to be stable. Our results strengthen and extend previous numerical analyses, showing that even for the most compact configurations the multipolar structure deviates significantly from that of a Kerr black hole. We provide accurate data for the multipole moments as functions of the object\u2019s mass and spin, which can be directly used to construct inspiral waveform approximants and to perform parameter estimations and searches for boson star binaries.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy has opened new opportunities for tests of fundamental physics [1]. A cornerstone of this program is to use GW data to probe the nature of compact objects [2\u20134], and in particular to explore the possibility that astrophysical compact sources other than black holes (BH) and neutron stars can exist in the Universe. These hypothetical objects can provide a new portal to test a variety of particle and high-energy physics models [5, 6] and could be an exotic explanation [7] for the LIGO/Virgo \u201cmass-gap events\u201d (e.g. GW190814 [8] and GW190521 [8, 9]) which do not fit naturally within the standard astrophysical formation scenarios for BHs and neutron stars.\nAmong the plethora of exotic compact objects [2], boson stars (BSs) stand out as one of the best motivated models arising from a concrete field theory. BSs are selfgravitating solitons, composed of either scalar [10\u201312] or vector [13], massive complex fields, minimally coupled to Einstein\u2019s gravity (see [14, 15] for some reviews). At variance with other models, for BSs the whole dynamics (including BS mergers [7, 16\u201319] and nonlinear stability analysis [20\u201322]) and phenomenology can be studied from first principles. They are therefore a natural target for GW searches.\nDeviations in the GW inspiral signals with respect to the case of BH and neutron star binaries can be traced back to the so-called finite-size effects, which encode the properties of the object\u2019s internal structure. In a postNewtonian expansion of Einstein\u2019s field equations for a binary system, the leading-order effect depending on the internal structure of the binary components is the spininduced mass quadrupole moment, M2 [23]. According to General Relativity, if the object is a stationary BH, it must be axisymmetric and described by the Kerr solution. Due to the symmetries of the latter, the multipolar structure of a BH in General Relativity is encoded in a\nclosed-form, elegant, relation [24]\nMBH` + iS BH ` = M `+1 (i\u03c7) ` , (1)\nwhere M` (S`) are the Geroch-Hansen mass (current) multipole moments [24, 25], M \u2261M0 is the mass, J \u2261 S1 is the angular momentum, and \u03c7 \u2261 J/M2 is the dimensionless spin1. Introducing the dimensionless quantities M\u0304` \u2261M`/M `+1 and S\u0304` \u2261 S`/M `+1, the only nonvanishing moments of the Kerr spacetime are\nM\u0304BH2n = (\u22121)n\u03c72n , S\u0304BH2n+1 = (\u22121)n\u03c72n+1 (2)\nfor n = 0, 1, 2, .... Besides the fact that the entire multipolar structure is completely determined only by the BH mass and spin, having M` = 0 (S` = 0) when ` is odd (even) is a consequence of the equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, whereas the fact that all nonvanishing `-th multipoles (with ` \u2265 2) are proportional to \u03c7` is a peculiarity of the Kerr metric.\nAny deviation from the above multipolar structure would imply that the underlying spacetime is not described by the Kerr solution. Therefore, measuring any multipole moment of a compact object in addition to the mass and spin would provide a null-hypothesis tests of the Kerr metric [1, 2, 30\u201334].\nGoing beyond null-hypothesis tests (e.g. if one wishes to perform model selection between the Kerr hypothesis and a more exotic model) requires computing the multipolar structure of alternative objects. In particular, the\n1 For a generic spacetime the multipole moments of order ` are rank-` tensors, M`m and S`m, which reduce to scalar quantities, M` and S`, in the axisymmetric case, see e.g. Refs. [26, 27] for the general definitions. In this paper we shall only focus on axisymmetric and equatorial symmetric spacetimes and therefore we shall only deal with scalar quantities with the same symmetries of Kerr\u2019s (see [28, 29] for a recent work in which the equatorial and axial symmetries are relaxed).\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n07 44\n2v 1\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 4\nM ar\n2 02\n2\n2 multipolar structure of BSs differs from that of a BH and depends on the underlying scalar self-interactions [6, 35], similarly to the case of neutron stars where the multipole moments depend on the underlying equation of state.\nThe multipolar structure of BSs with quartic scalar interactions was computed in a seminal paper by Ryan [35] by using a perfect-fluid approximation scheme valid in the large self-coupling regime and implementing an iterative method to solve for Einstein\u2019s equations in the stationary and axisymmetric case. The scope of this work is to extend Ryan\u2019s analysis in order to accurately compute the leading-order moments (the mass quadrupole and the current octupole) in the entire parameter space of the model, and to provide accurate data, useful to build waveform templates [36\u201338] for actual searches and parameter estimation. Henceforth we adopt G = c = 1 units."

In this work we consider a specific family of massive BSs [12, 35], featuring repulsive quartic selfinteractions,\nV (|\u03c6|2) = m2|\u03c6|2 + 1 2 \u03bb|\u03c6|4 . (8)\nMoreover we focus on the strong coupling limit \u03bb/m2 1, in which the maximum mass supported by static configurations scales as [12]\nMmax \u223c 0.06 \u221a \u03bb~ m2s M3p , (9)\nwhere ms = m~ is the mass of the boson and Mp the Planck mass. Equation (9) shows that, for \u03bb \u223c O(~\u22121) and ms in the range 1\u2013100 MeV, stellar configurations with Mmax in the range 10\u201310\n5 M are supported. This is different from the case of mini BSs described by noninteracting scalars [10, 11], where the same mass range requires ultralight bosons. Moreover, large self-interactions are also expected to quench [22] the instabilities observed in numerical simulations of rotating mini BSs [20, 21]."

            "text": "In the strong coupling regime the numerical integration of the stellar equations greatly simplifies. As discussed in [12], for spherically-symmetric solutions it is possible to identify two distinct regions in the object radial domain, corresponding to different behaviours of the field\u2019s energy density. At large values of r the BS features a tail region where \u03c6 decays exponentially as \u223c e\u2212 \u221a m2\u2212\u21262r/r. At smaller r, an inner non-tail region sets up, where the field has significantly larger amplitude and most of the object\u2019s mass is localized. In this zone \u03c6 varies on a very large scale, such that one can safely assume \u03c6,r ' 0, while in the tail region, although \u03c6,r is in general not negligible, the field vanishes quickly due to the the exponential suppression and can be set to zero. We have numerically confirmed the validity of these assumptions, as shown in Fig. 1, which displays the radial profile of \u03c6 for two spherically symmetric BSs with the same frequency, built considering \u03c6non-tail,r \u223c 0, \u03c6tail \u223c 0 (solid curve) and without any approximation (dashed curve).\nIn the spinning case, a further simplification can be made. Indeed, as noted in [35], the symmetry of the solution suggests that the field stress-energy tensor should vary on the same scale when the star is rotating or not,\n3 such that in both cases derivatives with respect to the radial direction and the polar angle \u03b8 can be neglected in the non-tail region, while in general \u03c6,\u03d5 6= 0. Setting\n\u03c6,r and \u03c6,\u03b8 to zero in the stress-energy tensor and using the ansatz (6), we can recast T\u00b5\u03bd within the inner region in the following form\nT\u00b5\u03bd = ( + P )u\u00b5u\u03bd + Pg\u00b5\u03bd , (10)\nwhere\n(ut, ur, u\u03b8, u\u03d5) = A \u22121/2(\u2212\u2126, 0, 0, s) , (11a) A = g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6\u2217,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2\n|\u03c6|2 \u2248 (\u2212gtt\u21262 + 2gt\u03d5\u2126s\u2212 g\u03d5\u03d5s2) , (11b)\nand we identify the field\u2019s pressure and energy density\nP = 1 2 A|\u03c6|2 \u2212 1 2 V (|\u03c6|2) , (12a)\n= 1 2 A|\u03c6|2 + 1 2 V (|\u03c6|2) . (12b)\nIn the tail region we assume that the scalar field is negligible, and we set T\u00b5\u03bd = 0. Therefore, within the entire domain of integration, the stress-energy tensor resembles that of a perfect fluid.\nNote that, in the inner region of a rotating massive BS, the energy density develops a non-trivial topology. Indeed, neglecting the radial and polar derivatives of \u03c6, the scalar field satisfies the constraint equation(\nA\u03c6\u2212 dV d|\u03c6|2\n\u03c6 ) = A\u03c6\u2212m2\u03c6\u2212 \u03bb|\u03c6|2\u03c6 = 0 , (13)\nwhose solutions are|\u03c6|2 = A\u2212m2 \u03bb if A > m2 ,\n\u03c6 = 0 if A \u2264 m2 .\nOn the other hand, outside the inner region |\u03c6| \u223c 0. Therefore, under the above approximations, the general expression for |\u03c6|2 reads\n|\u03c6|2 = max[0, (\u2212gtt\u21262 + 2gt\u03d5\u2126s\u2212 g\u03d5\u03d5s2 \u2212m2)/\u03bb]\n= max [ 0, 1\n\u03bb\n( (\u2126 \u2212 s\u03c9)2\ne\u03b3+\u03c1 \u2212 e\n\u03c1\u2212\u03b3s2\nr2 sin \u03b82 \u2212m2\n)] .\n(14)\nThe pressure, energy density, and four-velocity can be expressed in terms of |\u03c6|2 as2\nP = 1\n4 \u03bb|\u03c6|4 , (16a) = m2|\u03c6|2 + 3 4 \u03bb|\u03c6|4 , (16b)\n(ut, ur, u\u03b8, u\u03d5) = (\u2212\u2126, 0, 0, s)\n(\u03bb|\u03c6|2 +m2) 12 . (16c)\nBy combining Eqns. (14)-(16) one can see that the energy density of rotating BSs develops a toroidal shape, as evident from Eq. (14) which shows that |\u03c6|2 is zero near the polar axis where sin \u03b8 \u2248 0. This behaviour is displayed in Fig. 2 for a representative model. Note also that, in the absence of rotation, the torus degenerates into a spherical profile.\n2 Therefore, in this approximation the interior of the star is described by a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state\nP ( ) = m4\n\u03bb\n( 1 + \u221a 1 + 3 \u03bb\nm4\n)2 .

In geometrical units [\u03bb] = [mass]\u22122 and [m] = [mass]\u22121, such that the ratio MB \u2261 \u03bb 1 2 /m2 has the dimension of a mass. We can then introduce the following dimensionless quantities:\nt\u0303 = t/MB , r\u0303 = r/MB , (17a)\nP\u0303 = PM2B , \u0303 = M 2 B , \u03c9\u0303 = \u03c9MB . (17b)\nIt is also convenient to define the dimensionless frequency \u2126\u0303 = \u2126/m \u2208 (0, 1), where for a BS \u2126 is always smaller than m, and the limit \u2126\u0303 \u2192 1 corresponds to the non-relativistic (weak self-gravity) regime.\nWe can now scale the remaining dimensionless quantities by the ratio \u03bb1/2/m, in order to factor out the coupling constant from our equations:\ns\u0303 = m\n\u03bb 1 2 s , |\u03c6\u0303|2 = \u03bb m2 |\u03c6|2 .

This is a valid approximation for configurations with large values of s since, by virtue of the first relation in Eq. (18), the magnitude of s\u0303 will be large compared to the spacing between two consecutive values, since m/\u03bb1/2 1 [35]. Solutions with a given s\u0303 can also be regarded as configurations with small s. This, however, implies a constraint on the physical masses and spins of the dimensionful rescaled configurations, since the ratio \u03bb1/2/m becomes necessarily a multiple of 1/s\u0303. Moderate and fast spinning BSs with small s cannot be obtained with our method, because they will have large s\u0303 and the first equation in (18) cannot be satisfied without violating the assumption \u03bb1/2/m 1. Indeed BSs with small s and large \u03c7 only exist outside the strong self-coupling limit. With the variable transformations in Eqns.

To this aim we adopt the self-consisted method presented in [35], as an application of Hachisu self-consistent field approach. The essence of this method lies in turning Einstein equations into an integral form which allows for an iterative resolution scheme. The first step toward the solution is writing the field equations in order to isolate on one side all operators having known Green functions and on the other side terms which can be regarded as effective sources.\nThe Einstein equations for \u03c1, \u03b3 and \u03c9 can be written in the following form [40]:\n4(\u03c1e \u03b3 2 ) = S\u03c1(r, \u00b5) , (22a)(\n4+ 1 r \u2202 \u2202r \u2212 1 r2 \u00b5 \u2202 \u2202\u00b5\n) \u03b3e\n\u03b3 2 = S\u03b3(r, \u00b5) , (22b)(\n4+ 2 r \u2202 \u2202r \u2212 2 r2 \u00b5 \u2202 \u2202\u00b5\n) \u03c9e (\u03b3\u22122\u03c1) 2 = S\u03c9(r, \u00b5) , (22c)\nwhere \u00b5 = cos \u03b8, 4 is the Laplacian operator in spherical coordinates, and the sources appearing on the right hand side are known expressions of the metric functions and their derivatives.\nThe differential equation (22a) can be put in an integral form with the use of the three-dimensional Laplacian Green function:\n\u03c1 = \u2212e \u2212 \u03b32\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u221e 0 dr\u2032 \u222b 1 \u22121 d\u00b5\u2032 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03d5\u2032r\u20322 |r \u2212 r\u2032| S\u03c1(r \u2032, \u00b5\u2032) .

            "text": "Relativistic multipole moments characterize the structure of astrophysical compact objects, their gravitational field, including non-linear contributions [41] and their GW emission [23]. The actual computation of the multipole moments greatly simplifies in a wide class of asymptotically Cartesian and mass centered coordinates [42], which allows reading the multipole moments directly off the asymptotic behavior of the metric coefficients. Rotating axial (and equatorial) symmetry BSs are characterized by two families of scalar multipoles, the mass {M2i}i=0,...\u221e and the current {S2i\u22121}i=1,...\u221e moments, which can be extracted from the asymptotic behavior of the metric functions as in [35]:\n\u03c1 = \u2212 \u221e\u2211 n=0 [ 2 M2n r2n+1 +O ( 1 r2n+2 )] P2n(\u00b5) , (27a)\n\u03c9 = \u2212 \u221e\u2211 n=1 [ 2 2n\u2212 1 S2n\u22121 r2n+1 +O ( 1 r2n+2 )] P 12n\u22121(\u00b5) sin \u03b8 ,\n(27b)\nwith the lowest multipoles M0, S1 \u2261 J , and M2 corresponding to the mass, angular momentum, and quadrupole moment, respectively. Comparing Eqns. (27) with the explicit form of the metric in Eqns. (A1a)-(A1c) it is straightforward to identify the mass and current mo-\nments as integrals over the source terms S\u03c1 and S\u03c9:\nM2n = 1\n2 \u222b r 0 dr\u2032(r\u2032)2n+2 \u222b 1 0 d\u00b5\u2032P2n(\u00b5 \u2032)S\u03c1(r \u2032, \u00b5\u2032) ,\n(28a)\nS2n\u22121 = 1\n4n \u222b r 0 dr\u2032(r\u2032)2n+2\n\u00d7 \u222b 1\n0\nd\u00b5\u2032 sin \u03b8\u2032P 12n\u22121(\u00b5 \u2032)S\u03c9(r \u2032, \u00b5\u2032) . (28b)\nHowever, as noticed in [43], the specific choice of radial coordinate leading to the line element (19) renders the identifications of the multipole moments with the coefficients M2n and S2n ambiguous. To correctly match the definition of multipole moments given by Geroch and Hansen [41], all terms in Eq. (27) with n \u2265 2 must be corrected by adding a mass-spin dependent shift, yielding for the lowest moments:\nMGH2 =M2 \u2212 4\n3 (1 4 + \u03b30 M20 ) M30 , (29a)\nSGH3 =S3 \u2212 12\n5 (1 4 + \u03b30 M20 ) S1M 2 0 , (29b)\nwhere MGH2n and S GH 2n\u22121 are Geroch-Hansen moments, and the coefficient \u03b30 can be read-off from the asymptotic 1/r expansion\ne\u03b3 \u223c \u221a \u03c0\n2\n[( 1 +\n\u03b30 r2\n) T\n1/2 0 + \u03b32 r4 T 1/2 2 + ....\n] , (30)\nwhere T 1/2 l (\u00b5) are the Gegenbauer polynomials. We discuss the relevance of such corrections in Sec. VI, but we can anticipate that, for all the BS configurations that we have considered, the correction due to the shift in (29) is below 2%. For this reason, hereafter we will not distinguish between {MGH2n , SGH2n\u22121} and {M2n, S2n\u22121}, discussing numerical results for the latter only.\nIt is convenient to introduce the reduced multipoles of order n:\n\u03ba2n \u2261(\u22121)n M2n \u03c72nM2n+10 = (\u22121)n M\u03042n \u03c72n , (31)\n\u03c32n\u22121 \u2261(\u22121)n+1 S2n\u22121 \u03c72n\u22121M2n0 = (\u22121)n+1 S\u03042n\u22121 \u03c72n\u22121 , (32)\nwith the leading multipoles being the reduced quadrupole and spin-octupole moments\n\u03ba2 = \u2212 M2 \u03c72M30 , \u03c33 = \u2212 S3 \u03c73M40 . (33)\nThese quantities are regular in the small-\u03c7 limit, and depend on the mass M \u2261 M0 and the effective coupling MB = \u03bb 1 2 /m2 only through the dimensionless combination M/MB . For a Kerr BH, \u03ba BH 2n = \u03c3 BH 2n\u22121 = 1. As a comparison, for neutron stars \u03baNS2 \u223c 1 \u00f7 10 depending on the internal composition [44, 45].

            "text": "We have solved the system of equations for the metric functions and the scalar field discussed in Sec. III by using a self-consistent iterative scheme. The full solution depends on the radius and the polar angle, defined on a two-dimensional grid (r, \u03b8) with a fixed size (see discussion in the next section). Numerical calculations have been coded in C according to the following iterative procedure:\n1. We start by selecting an initial guess for the metric functions (\u03c1, \u03b3, \u03c9, \u03b1)(1), the angular frequency \u2126 and a specific value of s. The initial guess for the metric and the angular frequency corresponds to a solution of the field equations for a nonspinning, spherically symmetric BS as explained in Appendix B, while s is initialized to a small but non-zero value, s \u223c 0.01.\n2. From such initial configuration, we compute the energy density, pressure and scalar field amplitude ( , P, \u03c6)(1) using Eqns. (20c)-(21).\n3. We replace (\u03c1, \u03b3, \u03c9,\u2126, , P, \u03c6)(1) into the source terms on the right hand side of Eqns. (A1), and perform the numerical integration, obtaining the values of the metric functions at the next step (\u03c1, \u03b3, \u03c9)(2). The metric component \u03b1(2) is obtained by direct integration of Eq. (26).\n4. The energy density, pressure and scalar field amplitude (P, , \u03c6)(2) are then computed from the above quantities, thus completing one full iteration of the procedure. The solution is then improved iteratively by repeating steps 1-4 until the desired convergence is reached.\n5. We use weighted averages of the metric functions to boost the convergence of the algorithm. Let f(k) collectively represent the values of each of the four components (\u03c1, \u03b3, \u03c9, \u03b1) after the kth iteration. Using f(k) to evaluate the source terms in Eq. (A1)\nand integrating, we obtain the new values f\u0303(k+1), which one would naively use as the inputs for the next iteration. Instead, following [40], we build the linear combinations\nf(k+1) = af\u0303(k+1) + (1\u2212 a)f(k) , (34)\nwhere a \u2208 (0, 1) is a weight factor. The use of weighted averages avoids the solution to bounce among successive iterations. Hereafter we fix a = 1/3, which we found to provide the best compromise between the speed and the accuracy of the convergence.\n6. As a convergence criterion, we ask that the maximum relative difference between the values of all\nmetric functions at two successive iterations, evaluated on the two-dimensional grid (r, \u03b8), is smaller than a threshold \u03b4:\n\u2206f = max (r,\u03b8) |f(i+1)/f(i) \u2212 1| < \u03b4 , f = (\u03c1, \u03b3, \u03b1, \u03c9) . (35) For example, the algorithm needs about 150 iterations for the solution to converge with a maximum relative error \u223c 10\u22125.\nAt each iteration, we adjust the input values of \u2126 and s in such a way that the total mass and angular momentum, as determined by Eqns. (28), are kept fixed to their predetermined desired values. This adjustment is implemented through a two-dimensional Newton-Raphson method by solving the equations M(\u2126k, sk) = Mfin and J(\u2126k, sk) = Jfin for (\u2126k, sk) at each k-th iteraction. This procedure allows us to choose, at the beginning of the numerical simulation, the mass and spin of the BS solution3.\nThe metric functions are integrated on a two dimensional discrete grid for the coordinates r and \u00b5 = cos \u03b8. We divide the angular domain into n\u00b5 equally-spaced steps within [0, 1]. We compactify the radial direction thorugh the change of coordinates\nr \u2261 r(q) = q 1\u2212 q , (36)\nsuch that the radial domain r \u2208 [0,\u221e) is mapped into the finite domain q \u2208 [0, 1). We perform the integration between q(r0) = r0/(r0 + 1) and q(rmax) = rmax/(rmax + 1), where r0 = 10\n\u22126 and rmax = 10, which is typically two orders of magnitude larger than the radius of the BSs considered. We have verified that our results are stable for changes of both r0 and rmax. The number of grid points in the radial direction was fixed to nq = 600, while in the angular domain we choose different setups depending on the spin. Small values of \u03c7 render the metric profile stiffer, and require a more refined lattice with larger values of n\u00b5.\nDerivatives in Eqns. (A2) are numerically evaluated through a five-point central approximation, except near the inner (outer) boundary were we used forward (backward) derivatives. Integrals in Eqns. (A1) are performed using the Simpson and the trapezoidal rule for the angular and the radial domain, respectively. We checked that higher order methods for both derivatives and integrals do not lead to significant changes in our results.\nIntegration near the pole for Eqn. (A1a) and (A1c) is\n3 Keeping M constant between different iterations is also necessary to guarantee convergence. Indeed, we found that leaving the value of \u2126 unchanged leads to a breakdown of the convergence after few iterations.\n7 simplified by resorting to the angular identities\nlim \u03b8\u21920 sin [(2n\u2212 1)\u03b8] (2n\u2212 1) sin \u03b8 = 1 , (37)\nlim \u03b8\u21920\nP 12n\u22121(cos \u03b8)\n2n(2n\u2212 1) sin \u03b8 = \u2212 (2n)!

            "heading": "A. Quadrupole and octupole moments of rotating massive BSs",
            "text": "We have studied the multipolar structure of arbitrarily rotating massive BS in the large coupling limit for different configurations specified by the spin parameter \u03c7 and by the object mass in units of MB . To simplify the comparison with previous results in the literature, we include in our sample the range of masses considered in [35] (we refer the reader to Appendix C for further comparisons).\nWe have carefully investigated how the obtained solutions are sensitive to the spacing of the numerical grid. We found that self-gravitating configurations are numerically stable under changes of the radial resolution (i.e. changes in nq), while for small spins, typically \u03c7 . 0.1, the integration becomes more sensitive to the angular resolution (i.e. to changes in n\u00b5). At large spins \u03c7 \u223c O(1), the radius, frequency, and multipole moments are well determined and stable by choosing nq \u223c n\u00b5 \u223c O(102) and setting n = 10 in Eq. (28a). Increasing the lattice density, as well as the cutoff value for n, typically yields changes of a few percent on the stellar structure. On the other hand, for slowly rotating BSs the calculation of multipole moments requires much larger values of n\u00b5 \u223c O(104), to converge to a stable solution. For this reason, to extract the quadrupole and octupole moments, we set the spacing of numerical grid to nq\u00d7n\u00b5 = 600\u00d720000 for \u03c7 \u2264 0.1 and nq \u00d7 n\u00b5 = 600\u00d7 1000 for \u03c7 \u2265 0.1.\nMoreover, as already discussed in [35], we find that for \u03c7 = 0 the quadrupole moment does not vanish, leading to a (small) numerical offset M (off) 2 = M2(\u03c7 = 0). This is a numerical artifact, as we know that M2 \u223c \u03c72 +O(\u03c74). Therefore, we manually subtracted the offset from the raw values, i.e., we define the physical quadrupole moments as M2 = M (raw) 2 \u2212M (off) 2 . The offset is negligible at large spin but it can spoil the M2 \u223c \u03c72 scaling at small spins. The top panels of Fig. 3 show the reduced quadrupole moment \u03ba (raw) 2 as obtained from the raw value of M (raw) 2 , along with the corresponding value of the offset \u03ba(off), as a function of n\u00b5 for a spinning BS with \u03c7 = 0.1 (left column) and \u03c7 = 0.0075 (right column). The mass of both configurations is fixed to M/MB = 0.04.\nWhile, for small n\u00b5, \u03ba (raw) 2 and \u03ba (off) 2 have comparable magnitude, by increasing the value of n\u00b5 the offset\ndecreases monotonically and the effect of subtracting it becomes progressively less important. This is reflected in the bottom panels of Fig. 3, where we show that \u03ba2/\u03ba (raw) 2 \u2192 1 as the angular resolution increases. The convergence is faster for higher spins (left panel). For a low value of the spin (right panel), the offset \u03ba (off) 2 contributes \u2248 25% when n\u00b5 = 20000, while the contribution reduces to \u2248 12% when n\u00b5 = 60000, the convergence being monotonic with n\u00b5. This is coherent with the fact, anticipated before, that convergence of the solution requires n\u00b5 ' 103 and n\u00b5 ' 2 \u00d7 104 for \u03c7 & 0.1 and \u03c7 < 0.1, respectively. We stress that only after subtracting the offset does M2 scale as \u03c7 2 at small spins.\nWe speculate that the convergence of \u03ba2 with n\u00b5 can be traced back to the BS topology. Solutions with small spin resemble closely the nonrotating spherical configurations. But, however small be the spin, rotating BSs are toroidal and they have no continuum limit to the spherical topology of the nonrotating case (because, for a given mass and fixed coupling, \u03c7 can only assume discrete values). Configurations with spins close to the minimum value show a steep decrease of the energy density near the rotation axis, which requires a large number of angular points to be fully resolved.\nThe reduced quadrupole moments \u03ba2 for different BS configurations, as a function of the dimensionless mass parameter M/MB and of the spin \u03c7, are shown in Fig. 4. For small values of \u03c7, \u03ba2 is nearly independent of the spin, i.e. M2 \u221d \u03c72, with the proportionality constant\n8 M /MB 0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n0.060\n10 -2 10\n-1 1\n10\n20\n50\n100\n200\n\u03f0\nk2\nFIG. 4.

As a comparison, \u03ba BH 2 = 1 for a Kerr BH with any spin.\ndepending only on the object mass. In the stable branch, configurations with larger masses are also more compact. Correspondingly, for fixed spin, \u03ba2 decreases as the mass increases. Interestingly, \u03ba2 is nonmonotonic with \u03c7, but it shows a gradual decrease between \u03c7 \u223c 0.03 and \u03c7 \u223c 1, after which it grows rapidly [35]. Note that the spin can also exceed the Kerr bound, i.e. \u03c7 > 1.\nThe extraction of the reduced octupole moment \u03c33 is more challenging due to the fact that, besides constant offsets, spurious numerical terms introduce additional nonphysical corrections at linear and quadratic order in the spin, spoiling the \u03c33 \u223c \u03c73 +O(\u03c75) dependence. Also in this case the offset is negligible for highly-spinning configurations.\nIn order to isolate the physical contribution, we fit the behavior of the octupole moment with a cubic polynomial S (raw) 3 (\u03c7) = a0 +a1\u03c7+a2\u03c7 2 +a3\u03c7 3 for different small values of the spin parameter. For all BS configurations considered, we find non-zero values for the three coefficients a0,1,2, with a0 \u223c a2 a1. After subtracting the constant, linear, and quadratic terms from the raw octupole moments, we recover the correct dependence S3 \u223c \u03c73. Furthermore, to reduce the numerical noise, which can potentially affect the precision of the fit, we averaged over the last 50 iterations of the algorithm, where \u2206f in Eq. (35) oscillates about its minimum value. As for M2, we find that the spurious coefficients a0,1,2 decrease for higher angular resolution (i.e., for larger values of n\u00b5).\nHowever, the extraction of \u03c33 is problematic for masses close to M/MB ' 0.06, i.e., to the maximum mass of non rotating BSs. As already observed in [35], the octupole moment is small for such masses and its accurate determination is prevented by numerical uncertainties. For this\nreason, we do not report the corresponding data. For the other configurations analyzed in Fig. 4, the reduced spinoctupole moment \u03c33 = \u2212S3/\u03c73M4, obtained though the procedure described above, is shown in Fig. 5. As for the\nquadrupole moments, the curves are constant at small spins and exhibit a transition to a region with negative slope in correspondence roughly of the same values of \u03c7.\nThe data for the quadrupole and octupole as a function of the spin \u03c7 and mass M/MB are publicly available online [46].\nThe values for \u03ba2 and \u03c33 plotted above ignore the corrections in the definition of the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments, Eq. (29). We show that, indeed, these corrections introduce a shift at the (sub-)percent level and therefore they can be ignored at the current numerical precision. As a representative example, we focus on a specific BS configuration with mass M = 0.06MB and different values of the spin. The corrections to the reduced quadrupole are shown in the last column of Table I for such models. We find that corrections to \u03ba2 are in general small, never exceeding a relative difference \u223c 2%, for the whole range of spins considered. The correction is larger for more compact configurations, therefore, given that M = 0.06MB corresponds to the maximum value of the compactness for non-spinning BSs, changes in \u03ba2 are even smaller for lower values of the mass, as those analysed in Fig 4. This picture holds as well for \u03c33, for which we find corrections smaller than 0.6% for configurations near the maximum considered mass.\nFinally, we have also checked that the first moments, namely the mass and spin as computed from Eqs.

Families of solutions with large s\u0303 have high spins as long as their frequency remains large. In particular, note that also configurations with \u03c7 1 are allowed. As \u2126 decreases along the curve, the mass and compactness increase and \u03c7 rapidly falls, approaching a\n4 As explained in Sec. V our code uses \u03c7 as input parameter.

Boson star mass as a function of the frequency \u2126 for four different values of s\u0303. The color range of each configurations is mapped to the value of the \u03c7, with, darker (lighter) tones corresponding to smaller (larger) spins.\nvalue \u03c7(Mmax) < 1. Moreover, \u03c7(Mmax) ' 1 for all stars with s\u0303 large enough that significative rotation rate and compactnesses are approached along the curve.\nBeside the maximum mass, we have also analysed the dependence on \u2126 of the BS compactness C = M/R, with\nR = R0e \u03c1(R0,\u03c0/2)\u2212\u03b3(R0,\u03c0/2) ,\nbeing the perimetral radius and R0 the stellar radius, i.e. the value of the r\u2212coordinate for which the scalar field vanishes, marking the division between the tail and the non-tail region (see Sec. II A). Figure 7 shows C as a function of the frequency, for the same stellar configurations considered before, plus other five with larger s\u0303.\nInterestingly, for s\u0303 . 0.2, the compactness depends linearly on the frequency and the relation is independent of the value of s\u0303 (or \u03c7). The latter only affects the minimum value of the frequency which can be reached by each family and the mass profile. This linear relation holds also for mini BSs in the stable branch, as can be appreciated examining the data in [49].\nAll families with s\u0303 & 0.25 reach a maximum value Cmax ' 0.4, smaller than the Buchdhal limit5, around \u2126min ' 0.5.\nDue to their large compactness, it is reasonable to expect that massive and fast spinning configurations develop ergoregions. Figure 8 shows indeed a sequence of BSs at the maximum mass allowed for a given value of \u03c7, which feature an ergoregion for sufficiently high spin.\n5 Note that although massive BSs in the strong coupling limit are described by a perfect fluid stress energy tensor, the Buchdahl limit [50] does not apply due to rotation [2].\n10\nNotice that the first appearance of an ergoregion is for a configuration with \u03c7 & 0.9, C & 0.30. Such a BS has s\u0303 \u223c 0.1, which translates, in the \u03bb1/2/m 1 limit, to a winding number s 1. The ergoregion shown in Fig. 8 arise for solutions in the stable branch6. However, although stable against radial perturbations, BSs with an ergoregion are unstable over longer timescales against nonspherical modes due to the so-called ergoregion instability [51, 52]. An interesting followup of our work could be to quantify the instability time scale for our configurations.\n6 This is different from the case of mini BSs, which exhibit ergoregions only for configurations in the unstable branch [49]."

            "text": "In this work we constructed fully relativistic solutions of rotating BSs with quartic self-interactions within a perfect fluid approximation scheme, valid in the large self-coupling regime. The Einstein equations have been solved with a numerical C code implementing the iterative method described in [35], which allows us to find configurations covering a wide portion of the parameter space, including those which are more relevant for phenomenology. Indeed, since the coupling constants are completely factored out from the numerical solution, each configuration corresponds to a family of BSs, sharing the same compactness and dimensionless spin but differing in the mass, the latter scaling linearly with the combination of the self-coupling and the boson\u2019s mass defined in Sec. II B.\nWe characterized the multipolar structure of these BSs up to the spin-octupole contribution, considering different sequences of compact configurations with constant mass, spanning a two-dimensional region in the mass-spin parameter space, including the slowly rotating regime. The values of the quadrupole and spin-octupole moments have been computed significantly more accurately than in previous work.\nOur results, summarized in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, confirm that the quadrupole moment is proportional to \u03c72 (as in the Kerr case) but only for slowly spinning BSs and that the constant reduced quadrupole moment in that regime has a minimum, causing the range of values of \u03ba2 to be not continuously connected to the BH value \u03baBH2 = 1. We found such minimum, as well as the reduced multipoles, except for very large spin configurations, to be larger than what reported in previous work. We also confirmed that the spin-octupole is proportional to \u03c73 (as in the Kerr case) only for low spins.\nMoreover, we discussed the masses and compactness of these objects, analyzing solutions with fixed rescaled winding number s\u0303 and for given values of the coupling constants. We showed that the maximum BS mass increases considerably for high s\u0303 and, as it grows, the maximum mass configuration is reached for lower and lower frequencies. The corresponding compactnesses approaches C \u223c 0.4, while the dimensionless spin parameter \u03c7 is close to unity. We found that some of these configurations have ergoregions in the branch connected to the Newtonian limit \u2126 \u2192 1.\nAmong various theoretical and observational applications of our results, multipole moments have interesting phenomenological consequences related to the socalled universal relations [45]. Indeed, it is known that approximated analytical relations exist between certain observables of a neutron star, such as the spininduced quadrupole moment, the tidal deformability \u039b, and the moment of inertia, which are roughly insensitive of the underlying equation of state [53]. The same functional form of these relations holds also for the reduced quadrupole moment of slowly spinning massive BSs and\n11\nits corresponding \u039b, as we have recently shown [6]. The numerical calculations discussed in this paper allows to strengthen our previous result, obtained with limited data and accuracy. Using the fits for \u039b provided in Ref. [54], the \u03ba2 \u2212 \u039b relation is shown Fig. 9, with the straight line identifying the semi-analytical fit\nlog \u03ba2 ' 1.2 + 0.32 log\u039b . (39)\nWe measured the distance of the data from the fit as the root mean square relative error \u03c3E = 0.01, where \u03c32E = 1 N \u2211N n=1(r i E) 2 and riE = \u03ba i 2\u2212 (1.2+0.32\u039bi) are the residuals.\nWe also used the data in Fig. 5 to explore the \u03c33\u2212\u039b relation. To reduce the numerical noise of \u03c33 at low spins, we average \u03c33(\u03c7 \u223c 0) over 10 points for \u03c7 . 0.02, for each value of the mass. The data are shown in Fig. 10 and suggest that a simple linear relation exists as well between log \u03ba2 and log\u039b. The relations discussed above might have many applications and are especially useful to break degeneracies among parameters that characterise gravitational waveforms [6]. On the theoretical side, proving that such \u03ba2\u2212\u039b and \u03c33\u2212\u039b relations also exist for other scalar field interactions is an interesting and challenging task, which will shed light on the origin of the universality, and will be investigated in a followup publication. The results presented in this work are valid as long as the self-coupling is large, in which case the anisotropies of the star are negligible. Nonetheless the approach is not limited to BSs with s 1, even if, for small s, only slowly rotating configurations can fully satisfy the requirement \u03bb/m2 1 coherently with the first of Eqs. (18). The extension of these results to the generic coupling regime and to different BSs potentials will be explored elsewhere. Likewise, it would be interesting to extend our analysis to compute the multipolar structure of Proca stars [13] or of Kerr BHs with bosonic hair [55\u201358]."

Dashed lines correspond to data extracted from Fig. 4 of [35]. The values of the reduced quadrupole agree remarkably well on a wide range of spins, with an average relative discrepancy smaller than 7% for all the considered BS masses.\nHowever, as discussed in Sec. V-VI, calculations of the multipole moments are sensitive to the choice of the angular spacing n\u00b5 for small values of the spin. By increasing n\u00b5 we find indeed that the values of \u03ba2 (and \u03c33) start deviating from those obtained in [35].\nIn the right panel of Fig. 11 we show the reduced quadrupole computed using a nq \u00d7 n\u00b5 = 1600 \u00d7 20000 grid, again compared with data produced in [35]. While at high spins, the agreement between the two sets of results still hold, for rotating BSs with \u03c7 . 0.1 our values are in general larger by a factor \u223c 2 than those calculated by Ryan. We also note that for M = 0.06MB , the reduced quadrupole obtained with increased accuracy features an overall change in the behavior of \u03ba2 as a function of \u03c7. As explained in Sec. VI we have checked that our results saturate for large enough n\u00b5. Indeed, doubling\n14\nthe grid resolution from n\u00b5 = 20000 to n\u00b5 = 40000 leads to variation in the multipole moments smaller than 5% for \u03c7 . 0.1 and even less for larger spins.\n[1] L.
