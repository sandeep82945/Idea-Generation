To enhance the catalytic activity, doping with metals, nonmetals, and polymers has been suggested. Incorporating an organic polymer such as PAA increases the catalytic and antibacterial activities due to the presence of a carboxylic group (\u2013COOH). It is a protective capping agent, capturing heavy metals from polluted water.28 The doping of inorganic metals such as Ag increased the degradation of dye andmicrobes because of the high surface-tovolume ratio.29 The combination of Ag and PAA dopants provides a large surface area for the adsorption of pollutants.30 Two approaches (top-down and bottom-up) are applied to the synthesis GQDs in top-down method focuses on breaking the precursors such as carbon bres, graphene sheets, and other carbonaceous compounds. In contrast, the bottom-up approach involves assembling basic units into nano-material.31 In the present study, a simple bottom-up method involving pyrolysis of glucose was used to prepare GQDs from the organic precursor to investigate the catalytic efficacy against RhB degradation and bactericidal potency for E. coli. This research contributes to discovering multifunctional, defensible, eco-friendly, and economic catalysts for maintaining water standards by reducing toxic products and blocking bacterial cell proliferation."

The CA of pure and doped GQDs was examined in the presence of a reducing agent (NaBH4) and an oxidizing agent, rhodamine B (RhB), for the degradation of RhB. Freshly prepared 1.5 mL of RhB solution was added to the quartz cuvette containing 400 mL of prepared 0.1 M NaBH4. Moreover, 400 mL of the prepared sample was dissolved into the solution. In the presence of NaBH4, RhB was reduced to leuco RhB (LRhB), conrming the dye degradation. The following equation calculated degradation efficiency: degradation (%) = (C0 \u2212 Ct)/C0 \u00d7 100%, where C0 and Ct are the initial and nal concentrations of RhB.\n2.2.2 Catalysis mechanism. The mechanism for the catalytic degradation of RhB involves the redox reaction between NaBH4 and RhB. Initially, reactants adsorbed onto the surface of nano-material, NaBH4 dissociates into BH4\n\u2212 and H+ ions which RhB accepts, favoring the breakdown of organic dye. However, in the presence of NaBH4 reaction was slow; to accelerate the degradation rate, synthesized specimens were added as catalysts. The enhanced catalytic rate was related to the signicant interaction among the nucleophilic reducing agent and electrophilic dye on the large surface area of quantum dots. The catalyst functions as an electron relay, permitting the transfer of electrons and detached H atoms from BH4\n\u2212 to the cationic dye that results in the breakage of the double bond byp conjugation. Finally, pink RhB was reduced to colorless LRhB,32,33 as shown in Fig. 2."

The incorporation of PAA/ Ag in pure GQDs led to an increase in catalytic activity due to the presence of COOH, which exhibited electrostatic interactions with the catalyst.66 The catalytic activity of pristine and doped GQDs is compared with the literature, as illustrated in Table 1."

During each cycle, the catalyst was separated from the solution using centrifugation, washed with DI water, and heated overnight at 60 \u00b0C. The reusability of GQDs, Ag/PAAGQDs, and PAA/Ag-GQDs were investigated over three\nconsecutive cycles (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h) for the RhB degradation, as depicted in Fig. 9d.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to characterize the spectrum of PAA/Ag-GQDs. The intent was to ascertain the elemental makeup and chemical nature of constituent elements. Fig S2a\u2013d\u2020 exhibits the narrow range XPS spectra of generated samples, specically highlighting the Ag O 1s and Ag 3d peaks. The measured binding strength of Ag O 1s in PAA/Ag-GQDs Fig. S2a\u2020 was determined to be 530.8 eV, therefore consistent with previous investigations.72,73 The determination of the precise position of the binding strength spike was accomplished by considering the ionic and electronegativity characteristics of constituent atoms within the molecule.

The inhibition zones were recorded as (4.15\u20135.85 mm) and (2.55\u20133.65 mm) at maximum and minimum doses, summarized in (Table 2). An inhibition region of 5.75 mm ciprooxacin (positive control) and 0 nm of DI water (negative control) was calculated as illustrated in Fig S3a and b.\u2020 The inhibition diameter of pure GQDs was increased as the dopant was incorporated. Nanomaterial generated oxidative stress related to the crystallinity, surface area, and diffusion ability. Ag/PAA-GQDs exhibited superior antimicrobial performance because Ag provides a large surface area, producing more reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to cell necrosis. Carboxyl and the hydroxyl group of PAA increased the production of ROS, leading to the extrusion of cytoplasmic components that eventually caused bacterial death.\nFig. 10 Binding interaction pattern with active site residues of b-lactam represents binding pocket, (b and e) 3D structure and (c and f) 2D struc\n28016 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 28008\u201328020\nDoped GQDs destroy the bacterial cell by membrane distortion, enzymes inactivation, proteins denaturation, leakage of cytoplasmic components and DNA deterioration, etc.,66\u201368,79\u201381 as displayed (Fig. S4\u2020).\nIn the past few decades, there has been signicant interest in molecular docking predictions for deciphering the enigma behind many biological functions. The signicance of cell wall synthesis (i.e., peptidoglycan production) and the nucleic acid biosynthetic route for identifying antibiotics is well established.82,83 In spite of the fact that the antibacterial activity of several nanostructures has been described in recent years,84,85 the specic mechanism of their actions requires additional investigation. The silver and polyacrylic acid-doped graphene quantum dots had a high binding score (5.13) inside the binding pocket of the b-lactamase enzyme in E. coli. The binding interaction pattern with important amino acid residues is shown in (Fig. 10a\u2013c) viaH-bonding with Gln120 and Asn152. The molecular docking predictions of silver and polyacrylic acid doped graphene quantum dots against DNA gyrase of E. coli revealed H-bonds with key amino acid residues such as Arg76, Thr165, and Gly77 (shown in Fig. 10d\u2013f).\nThe binding tendency of silver and polyacrylic acid doped graphene quantum dots revealed through molecular docking predicted these NPs as potential inhibitors of b-lactamase and DNA gyrase enzyme that is suggested to be further conrmed by in vitro enzyme inhibition techniques."

The increase in Eg from 3.03 to 3.14 eV accompanied by blue shi was exposed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. FTIR conrmed the presence of GQDs by displaying the vibration band of the sp2 carbon plane. TEM results conrmed that Ag particles attached to the surface of GQDs and PAA formed a layer on the surface of GQDs additionally, HRTEM micrographs revealed interlayer d-spacing (0.366 nm, 0.324 nm, 0.325 nm). EDS spectra revealed the presence of C, O, Au, and Ag, conrming the elemental composition of pristine and doped GQDs. The maximum RhB deterioration rate of 57.42% and 66.41% in basic and neutral media was observed for pure and PAA/Ag-GQDs, respectively. In silico docking studies identied inhibition of b-lactamase and DNA gyrase as potential mechanisms underlying silver and polyacrylic acid doped graphene quantum dots bactericidal behavior. Furthermore, the signicant inhabitation zone (5.85 mm) of PAA/Ag-GQDs against E. coli was recorded. In conclusion, these ndings imply that synthesized pure and doped GQDs effectively eliminate toxic effluents from industrial wastewater (dye degradation) and are effective against pathogens, low cost, environment-friendly, and can be used in the future.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare \u201cno conict of interest\u201d."
