    "abstractText": "Objectives The emergence of sleep disturbances in response to major stressful events has been previously documented. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an objective marker that provides insight into autonomic nervous system dynamics. The aim of the present study was to examine the preliminary effectiveness of a one-shot session of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) for frontline healthcare providers with acute insomnia. Methods This study was conducted from 2020 to 2021 on healthcare workers with insomnia. The healthcare workers were randomly allocated to receive either one-shot cognitive behavioral therapy or routine care. Insomnia severity index (ISI) and heart rate variability were assessed before and 1 month after the interventions. Results Among 57 patients (n = 31 in the intervention group and n = 26 in the control group), mean (\u00b1 SD) age of both groups were 34.6 (\u00b1 9.5) and 36.6 (\u00b1 6.9), respectively. Most participants in both groups were female (81% and 65% in the intervention and control groups, respectively; p-value = 0.10). Insomnia severity index score decreased in the intervention group from 13.3 to 6.7 (p < 0.001). The change before and after the intervention was significant between the two groups for HF-normalized unit (high-frequency power band [0.15\u20130.40 Hz] in the normalized unit) and LF/HF (the ratio of low frequency to high frequency). HF-normalized unit increased in the intervention group (35.8 \u00b1 21.5 vs. 45.6 \u00b1 19.8 before and after the intervention, respectively), and decreased in the control group (43.9 \u00b1 16.5 vs. 39.8 \u00b1 18.5, before and after the intervention, respectively). Conclusion The findings suggest that a single-shot session of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is effective in managing acute insomnia symptoms in healthcare workers.",

The COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of a stressful disaster. COVID-19 has caused anxiety disorders, depression, and insomnia among the general population and, in particular, healthcare workers (HCW) [3]. It has been indicated that moderately severe insomnia, anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality are very common among healthcare workers who had experienced COVID-19-like symptoms [4]. Hyperarousal is a physiologic reaction and is the main feature of insomnia. Insomnia is associated with autonomous system pathologies and causes multiple findings in patients such as increased body temperature, increased metabolic rate, and decreased heart rate variability [5]. Heart rate variability shows a quantitative difference between two consecutive heartbeats and is highly affected by the parasympathetic system. A high heart rate variability indicates the healthy activity of the cardiovascular autonomous nervous system and a low high heart rate variability indicates possible associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases [6]. Insomnia, especially if left untreated, could cause an increased risk of cardiovascular disorders and their risk factors [7]. Studies show autonomous system changes in insomnia are mainly a result of decreased heart rate variability and high sympathetic nervous system activity [8].\nBased on some studies, patients with insomnia may benefit from hyperarousal treatment [9]. One of the nonpharmacological treatment methods for insomnia is one-shot cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy sessions are a distinctive non-pharmacological therapeutic method [10, 11] that may eliminate the factors that cause long-term persistence of insomnia such as sleep-incompatible thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors [12]. The customary cognitive behavioral therapy sessions are often time-consuming and tedious [13, 14]. Therefore, efforts have been made to shorten and simplify this method [15\u201318].\nBased on previous studies, cognitive behavioral therapy may be effective and associated with beneficial results in patients with insomnia who might suffer from heart rate variability. However, the existing data seem insufficient for providing a clear treatment strategy. Considering the prevalence and importance of the COVID-19 pandemic and its enormous psychological stress on healthcare workers, the aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of oneshot cognitive behavioral therapy in the treatment of insomnia amongst healthcare workers in Iran during the COVID19 pandemic."

The current\nstudy was conducted on healthcare workers who suffer from acute insomnia. The study protocol was approved by the Research Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and the Ethics committee has confirmed it (Ethics code: IR.MUI.MED.REC.1399.1153, Iranian Registry for Clinical Trials (IRCT) code: IRCT20171219037964N4). The declaration of Helsinki was followed at every step. We report the results following the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT).\nThe inclusion criteria were age over 18\u00a0years, healthcare workers in Alzahra and Khorshid hospitals, having an insomnia severity index score of 8 or higher, and signing the written informed consent to participate in this study. The exclusion criteria were having any previous history of heart disease, seizure, bipolar disorders, narcolepsy, and other sleep disturbance disorders, or a desire to start physical activity in the following months, or undergoing treatment with antiarrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blockade medications.\nTo calculate the sample size, we considered a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Using the formula for calculating sample size in clinical trials, n = ( z 1\u2212 \u221d 2 +z )2 (S2 1 +S2 2 )\n( 1 \u2212 2 )2 , an ISI score of 9.6 \u00b1 5.0 for the intervention group and 12.6 \u00b1 3.5 for the control group [12], the sample size was calculated as 31 individuals per group.\nAn advertisement was published in Alzahra and Khorshid hospitals' online channels, inviting healthcare workers who suffer from acute insomnia to participate in this study. After describing the study for those who enrolled, participants were recruited based on the mentioned criteria.\nParticipants were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control using a simple randomization method (ratio, 1:1). A random sequence was produced using \u201crandomization.com\u201d and made available to the research assistant. Each person was given a unique code. The research assistant placed each person in the relevant group by matching the person\u2019s code with the random sequence. The person in charge of follow-up and the person in charge of data analysis were unaware of the study groups.\nData on demographic variables including age, sex (male/ female), job (nurse/physician, medical student, other healthcare workers roles), education (diploma and education level), having any comorbidities (yes/no), and using any medication (yes/no) were gathered at the beginning of the study.\nParticipants in the intervention group were asked to complete a sleep diary sheet documenting their sleep patterns in the previous 2\u00a0weeks. Then, they were divided into groups of 2\u20133 to receive the one-shot cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia session. In the cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia session, the therapist evaluated the diaries, took a brief history, then explained the stimulus control and some cognitions about insomnia and maladaptive behaviors that\n1 3\nmay convert acute insomnia into chronic insomnia. The sleep restriction strategy is applied and some pamphlets that included information about insomnia and its treatment were given to them. No interventions were performed for the participants in the control group. Primary outcomes, including insomnia state and heart rate variability, were evaluated before and 1\u00a0month after the intervention."

            "text": "The primary aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a \u201csingle-shot\u201d cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, with an accompanying information pamphlet, in the treatment of acute insomnia of healthcare workers. The results of our study suggest that this variant of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is suitable for most healthcare workers with acute insomnia and can improve all insomnia symptoms based on insomnia severity index score.\nThese findings could be of high importance and are in line with the previous literature on the impact of a singleshot cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia intervention for acute insomnia [11, 12]. The identification and management of insomnia is fundamental for healthcare workers. An important point is that previous studies have also reported higher rates of insomnia (34%\u201336%), anxiety (45%), and depressive symptoms (50%) among individuals at high risk of COVID-19 infection compared to the general population [3, 22]. Additionally, many studies have established that insomnia itself is a risk factor for developing depression, anxiety, and suicide [23]. The findings from the present study suggest that a single shot of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, with an accompanying self-help pamphlet, has promise in this setting for individuals with acute insomnia.\n1 3\nIn the spectral analysis of heart rate variability, the LF band region was previously called the baroreceptor range because it mainly reflects baroreceptor activity during resting conditions [24]. LF power may be produced by both the parasympathic nervous system (PNS), sympathic nervous system (SNS), and blood pressure (BP) regulation\u00a0via\u00a0baroreceptors [24\u201326]. In resting conditions, the LF band reflects baroreflex activity and not cardiac sympathetic innervation [12]. By evaluating the neurophysiology, it should be noted that efferent vagal activity contributes significantly to the HF component, as seen in clinical and experimental observations of autonomic maneuvers such as electrical vagal stimulation, muscarinic receptor blockade, and vagotomy [25, 27, 28].\nRegarding LF/HF ratio, there are some studies [29] that challenge the belief that the LF/HF ratio measures \u201csympatho-vagal balance\u201d [30, 31]. Nonbelievers say that LF power is not a pure index of SNS drive. Half of the variability in this frequency band is due to the PNS, and unknown factors produce a smaller proportion. PNS and SNS interactions are complex, non-linear, and frequently non-reciprocal. Additionally, confounding by respiratory mechanics and resting heart rate creates uncertainty regarding PNS and SNS contributions to the LF/HF ratio during the measurement period [32].\nShaffer et\u00a0al. [33] warned that the LF/HF ratio is controversial because of different processes, for example, the SNS contribution to LF power varies profoundly with testing conditions.\nIn our evaluation, this ratio decreased after the intervention compared to the control group. By frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability, a comparison of the two groups after 1\u00a0month shows a significant decrease in LF value in the control group. If we assume the LF is a sympathetic activity, then the results are in favor of disability of intervention for SNS suppression. This would be against our hypothesis but consistent with recent studies [33]. This may be due to our method of heart rate variability recording (people were lying down); or since the LF-normalized unit values had not changed, it is not important.\nAnother finding of this study is that we observed significantly increased PNS activity (according to HF-normalized unit and HF value), compared with baseline and control groups, after cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in the intervention group. There was evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy positively affects changes in inflammation in patients with insomnia [34] and significant heart rate variability changes in the responders group suggesting that successful insomnia treatment reduces sympathetic hyperactivity and stimulates parasympathetic activity. These are consistent with our results.\nPrevious evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia\u2019s effect on heart rate variability done by Jarrin et\u00a0al. [32] shows no significant differences in mean heart rate variability changes between responders and no responders or between remitters and non-remitters in either S2 or REM. However, there were some fundamental differences between the methodologies of that study and this study. Such differences may be justified in the way that our samples were taken from acute sleepless healthcare workers with probably high levels of anxiety, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of patients with chronic insomnia. Furthermore, we assessed the ECGs of our samples while awake in a lying position, not during sleep. We should note that one-shot cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia was done for the intervention group instead of full cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is more time-consuming. Therefore, it is believed that long-term treatment in the other study may be responsible for different results."

Accordingly, future research is needed to examine whether or not treatment is associated with improvements in other cardiovascular biochemistry and physiology (e.g., lipids, endothelial function) because these data would support the notion that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia reduces the risk of future cardiovascular disease or its precursors. Furthermore, it would be valuable to include longitudinal, randomized clinical trials to establish whether or not treatment produces a cardiovascular safeguard.\nFunding The current research was granted by the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.\nData availability The data are available in a ZIP file and could be uploaded when requested."
