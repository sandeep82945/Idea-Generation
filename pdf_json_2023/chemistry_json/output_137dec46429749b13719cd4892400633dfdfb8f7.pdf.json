    "abstractText": "Fomitopsis officinalis is a holartic polyporous mushroom that forms large fruiting bodies on old standing trees, fallen logs, or stumps. F. officinalis is a medicinal mushroom species that is most commonly used in traditional European medicine. In this study, we explore the spatial metabolic differences in F. officinalis\u2019 mushroom parts, i.e., the cap (median and apical parts) and the hymenium. Additionally, chromatographic analysis was conducted in order to unravel the composition of specialized metabolites in the hydroalcoholic mushroom extracts. The potential antifungal and bacterial effects of extracts were tested against pathogen strains of Gram+ and Gram\u2013 bacteria, and yeast, dermatophytic, and fungal-pool species. Extracts from the apical part were the richest in terms of phenolic compounds; consistent with this finding, the extracts were also the most effective antiradical and antimicrobial agents with MIC values < 100 \u03bcg/mL for most of the tested bacterial and dermatophytic species. According to these findings, F. officinalis extracts are valuable sources of primary and secondary metabolites, thus suggesting potential applications in the formulation of food supplements with biological properties in terms of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.",

            "text": "Fomitopsis officinalis (Vill.) Bondartsev and Singer (syn. Laricifomes officinalis (Vill.) Kotl. and Pouzar) is a holartic polyporous mushroom belonging to the Fomitopsidaceae family (Polyporales order) that forms large fruiting bodies on old standing trees, fallen logs, or stumps. It is a slow-growing necrotrophic parasite causing intensive brown rot in wood. Basidiomata are perennial and sometimes reach a considerable size [1,2]. F. officinalis is easily distinguished from other Fomitopsis species due to its chalky texture, and distinctive smell and taste [1,2].\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 766. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12040766 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nThe existence of this species was reported in Europe, Asia, North Africa, and North America. Western Europe (the Alps), North Asia (Siberia from the Ural Mountains to the Russian Far East), and North America are the three major distribution areas of F. officinalis [3,4]. This species was reported on several hosts in North America, such as Abies Mill., Larix Mill., Picea A. Dietr., Pinus L., Pseudotsuga Carri\u00e8re, and Tsuga Carri\u00e8re [5]. In Eurasia, it can be found mostly on Larix spp. and sometimes on Pinus spp. In Europe, it has been frequently recorded on Larix decidua Mill. [4]. F. officinalis is a medicinal mushroom species that was most commonly used in traditional European medicine [6]. This species contains molecules such as agaricinic acid and chlorinated coumarins with antibacterial activity against Gram bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the Herpes simplex virus, Poxviridae, Orthopoxvirus, and the Type A influenza virus in birds (H5N1) and humans (H3N2) [3]. Chlorinated coumarins from mycelia and lanostane triterpenoids from basidiomes are directly responsible for antiviral or antibacterial and trypanocidal activity, respectively [3]. Among the bioactive compounds of F. officinalis, lanostane-type triterpenoids constitute the main group [6]. Other biological activities of F. officinalis extracts are anticancer [7] and anti-inflammatory [8]. Recently, one of these compounds (dehydrosulfurenic acid), specifically found in F. officinalis, was patented as a potential pharmaceutical treatment for ischemic stroke [9]. Metabolomics provides a quantitative and/or qualitative estimation of all low metabolites (small molecules with a molecular weight of less than 1800 Da) present in biological systems, for instance, fungi, plants, animals, and prokaryotes [10,11]. In recent years, metabolomics has emerged as an important methodology to determine the temporal and spatial correlations between metabolic cues and associated phenotypes in mushroom species [12]. A large number of studies elucidated the gamut of important metabolites in F. officinalis for their organoleptic properties, flavor, and nutritional and functional aspects, particularly anticancer potential [13,14]. Although the majority of studies characterized the lanostane-type triterpenoids class of secondary metabolites from F. officinalis [15\u201318], the spatial distribution of primary and secondary metabolomes in different mushroom parts is largely unknown with respect to the associated phenotypes. In this study, we designed a nontargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic framework to explore the spatial metabolic differences in F. officinalis mushroom parts, i.e., the cap (median and apical parts) and the hymenium. Further, we established the correlation between the discriminant metabolite classes, and the specific mushroom parts (phenotypes) and bioactivities. Additionally, chromatographic analysis was conducted in order to unravel the composition of specialized metabolites in the mushroom extracts prepared with a hydroalcoholic solution. Considering the potential antifungal and antibacterial effects of extracts from edible mushrooms [11,19], the above-mentioned extracts were tested for potential growth-inhibitory effects against the pathogen strains of Gram+ and Gram- bacteria, and yeast, dermatophytic, and fungal-pool species."

            "text": "Phenolic compounds are important phytochemicals whose content in plant extracts is generally determined with the Folin-Ciocalteu spectrophotometric and HPLC methods. Table 4 shows the values of the total phenol content (TPC) and antioxidant activity of the extracts of the three parts of F. officinalis (hymenium, apical, and median parts). The values for total phenoliv content ranged from 89.61 mg GAE/100 g in the median part to 116.12 mg GAE/100 g in the apical part of the mushroom.\nThe apical part (L4\u2013L6) was richer in total phenols, which was confirmed with chromatographic analysis (Supplementary Material Tables S1 and S2, Figures S1\u2013S4). Among the identified compounds, quercetin was the main phenolic compound. The recent interest in phenolic compounds characterizing edible mushrooms has been due to their health-promoting properties, such as their antioxidant potential. In order to evaluate the antioxidant activity of extracts, three complementary spectrophotometric in vitro assays were carried out. ABTS and DPPH assays measure the ability of antioxidants to scavenge chromogen ABTS or chromogen DPPH free radicals, respectively, while the FRAP assay allows for evaluating the reducing capacity of the extracts. All these assays were compared with the Trolox standard, a water-soluble vitamin E analog. In this paper, the highest values of ABTS (170.00 mg TE/g DW), DPPH (104.06 mg TE/g DW), and FRAP (198.00 mg TE/g DW) were found in apical part of F. officinalis. These results agree with the phenolic content; in fact, the lowest values of all spectrophotometric assays were found for the hymenium. A wide range of values of TPC and antioxidant activity was reported in a previous paper [22] that studied the optimization of the extraction of bioactives from Pleurotus ostreatus. TPC values ranged from 38.5 to 423.7 mg GAE/100 g and were all lower than those reported in this paper. Concerning antioxidant properties, Ianni et al. [22] reported a wide range for FRAP (6.0\u201370.0 mg TE/100 g value) and DPPH (8.7 to 172.0 mg TE/100 g) values, which are all lower than those obtained for F. officinalis, while ABTS values (110.7\u20131112.7 mg TE/100 g) were similar or lower, a comparison of the antioxidant assay results with those in the literature was sometimes not possible because the data of these assays were reported as EC50 or radical scavenging activity (%) [11,19,23\u201325]. A correlation study was also conducted considering all the extracts and all spectrophotometric parameters (Table 5). Good correlations were always obtained (R2 higher than 0.6874), and the best correlation values were found for TPC vs. FRAP (R2 = 0.9886) and DPPH vs. ABTS (R2 = 0.9755)."

            "text": "In the present study, the results of the antimicrobial effect of F. officinalis were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity of F. officinalis Extracts L1, L4, and L7 against the tested bacterial, yeast, and dermatophytic strains is shown in Tables 6\u20138. All F. officinalis extracts showed antimicrobial activity in the concentration range of 1.95\u2013200 \u00b5g/mL, but with a wide variability in terms of potency and selectivity (Tables 6 and 7). The growth inhibition of the yeast strains (Table 7) showed no sensitivity to the L1, L4, and L7 F. officinalis extracts. Regarding the growth inhibition of dermatophytic isolates (Table 8), T. tonsurans (CCF 4834),\nT. erinacei (CCF 5930), A. gypseum (CCF 6261), A. currei (CCF 5207) and A. insingulare (CCF 5417) were resistant to F. officinalis Extract L1; the strongest inhibition was observed for F. officinalis Extract L4 against T. tonsurans with an MIC value of 19.57 \u00b5g/mL; T. interdigitale was sensitive to all tested extracts with an MIC range between 31.49 and 125.99 \u00b5g/mL.\n* MIC values are reported as the geometric means of three independent replicates (n = 3). MIC range concentrations are reported within the brackets.\n* MIC values are reported as the geometric means of three independent replicates (n = 3). MIC range concentrations are reported within the brackets.\nWith reference to bacteria (Table 6), the highest antimicrobial activity of F. officinalis extracts was observed in Extract L1 (MIC 1.53\u2013<1.53) against Bacillus subtilis (PeruMycA 6), and Extracts L4 and L7 (MIC 3.86 and 7.71 \u00b5g/mL) against Escherichia coli (ATCC 10,536) with an MIC range of 3.86\u201379.37 \u00b5g/mL; S. typhi (PeruMycA 7) was the most resistant strain to F. officinalis extracts with an MIC range of 158.74\u2013>200. There were only two cases in which there was the least sensibility for L1 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538). In this case, the extracts also showed a wide range of sensibility (MIC 7.71 (6.12\u201312.25)\u2013158.74 (100\u2013200) \u00b5g/mL). MIC values under\n100 \u00b5g/mL were considered an indication of high antimicrobial activity [26]. The highest antimicrobial activity of L1 was observed against B. subtilis (MIC 1.53 \u00b5g/mL), L4 had a major affect towards E. coli (MIC 3.86 \u00b5g/mL), and the highest inhibition of L7 was again observed for B. subtilis (MIC 3.86 \u00b5g/mL). Collectively, Gram-negative bacterial strains (ATCC 10536 and 15442, PeruMycA 2, 3, and 6) were less sensitive to mushroom extracts than Gram-positive strains were. Comparing antimicrobial activity results is not easy, as the used methodology to produce fungal extracts may vary widely, and susceptibility is not only species-specific, but even strain-specific [27]. Nevertheless, the reported MIC values in the present study could be compared to those reported for other Basidiomycota [27]. In a different study involving Pleurotus ostreatus [22], this was also true for the tested bacteria strains. P. ostreatus extracts showed major antibacterial activity towards Gram+ bacteria, and the highest MIC value (9.92 \u00b5g/mL) was observed against B. subtilis (PeruMyca 6), which was the same as F. officinalis, but the highest MIC concentration (<6.25 \u00b5g/mL) was towards E. coli (ATCC 10536). In the same yeast strain, P. ostreatus had higher antimicrobial activity than that of F. officinalis, particularly against C. albicans (MIC 7.87 \u00b5g/mL; DBVPG 6379) [22]. The lowest sensitivity was observed for C. tropicalis (DBVPG 6184). The MIC values of griseofulvin and fluconazole for strains C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and C. krusei (ATCC 6258) were within the established ranges according to the CLSI M38 (CLSI 2018) and M38-Ed3 (CLSI 2017) protocols. Overall, regarding the growth-inhibitory effects exerted by the F. officinalis extracts towards the selected pathogen microbial strains, consistent with the intrinsic biological activity of the extract, namely, antiradical properties, Extracts L4\u2013L6 from the apical part were antimicrobially the most effective. This could partly be related to the phenolic compound content [28]. Although the MIC values were higher than those of the reference antimicrobial drugs, apical extracts were effective at <200 \u00b5g/mL concentrations, which are generally well-tolerated by human and murine cells [29]. Furthermore, MIC values < 100 \u00b5g/mL were considered an indication of high antimicrobial activity [26]."

The resulting extracts were then filtered through Whatman GF/C filters (Sigma, Germany), and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure (40 \u25e6C, 218 mbar) using a rotary vacuum evaporator (Rotavapor R-100, B\u00fcchi, Switzerland). The residue was kept at \u221220 \u25e6C until further use (Table 9)."

Determination of Antioxidant Activity\nFor the ABTS assay, radical cation ABTS+\u00b7was prepared via the reaction of ABTS with potassium persulfate solutions after being kept in the dark at room temperature for 12 h. The obtained reagent was diluted with ethanol until 0.70 (\u00b10.02) absorbance had been obtained at 734 nm. An aliquot of an ABTS+/ethanol solution was added to the extract, and the mixture was left in the dark for 6 min [22]. For the DPPH assay, the DPPH reagent (0.06 mM in ethanol) was added to the extract, and the mixture had been kept in the dark for 30 min before the absorbance was measured at 517 nm [22]. For the FRAP assay, the reagent, prepared by mixing a TPTZ solution with a FeCl3 solution and acetate buffer, was added to the sample extracts. The reaction mixture had been kept in the dark for 4 min before absorbance was measured at 593 nm [22]. The results of the antioxidant assays are expressed as mg Trolox equivalents (TE) per 100 g of dry weight (mg TE/100g dw) and were derived from a calibration curve of the Trolox standard (Table S3)."

The Agilent JetStream source was operated as follows: gas temperature (N2) 200 \u25e6C, drying gas 10 L/min, nebulizer 50 psi, sheath-gas temp: 300 \u25e6C at 12 L/min. Raw data were processed using the MS-DIAL software (4.48) [30] to perform peakpicking, alignment, and peak integration. The MS signal threshold was set at 1000 counts.\nA data matrix was obtained that accurately reported the mass and area of each revealed peak in each analyzed sample. Metabolites were putatively annotated and metabolic pathways were predicted using the mummichog algorithm [31] implemented in the \u2018MS Peaks to Pathways\u2019 module of Metaboanalyst 5.0 [32]. This considers any possible adducts and different ionic polarities, and classifies annotated peaks on the basis of the t-test. In this case, the list of putative compounds was mapped onto the KEGG library of Saccaromices cerevisiae. ANOVA and functional meta-analysis were also performed with MetaboAnalyst. For the statistical analysis, samples were normalized via the median, followed by Pareto scaling."

The present findings support more indepth investigations aimed at evaluating the influence of growth substrates on the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of F. officinalis. Extracts from distinct parts of the fruiting body of F. officinalis revealed different concentrations of secondary metabolites, thus suggesting potential applications in the formulation of food supplements with biological properties, especially in terms of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information about quantitative determination of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/ article/10.3390/antibiotics12040766/s1; Table S1: Gradient elution condition of the HPLC\u2014DAD\u2014 MS analyses; Table S2: Content in specialized metabolites; Table S3: Regression equation, linearity, range of concentration of standards (gallic acid for TPC, Trolox for ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP) used for the spectrophotometric assays; Chromatograms: Figures S1\u2013S4.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.A., L.M., L.C., and C.F.; methodology, P.A., L.M., L.C., and C.F.; software, P.A., L.M., and C.F.; validation, R.M.P., A.A., and G.A.F.; formal analysis, P.A., L.M., C.F., N., A.A., M.L.L., G.C., F.I., F.B., C.E., and S.C.D.S.; resources, P.A., L.M., and C.F.; data curation, P.A., L.M. and C.F.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.A. and G.A.F.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.A., L.M., C.F., G.Z. and G.O.; visualization, R.V., G.O. and G.Z.; supervision, R.V.; project administration, P.A., L.M., L.C. and C.F.; funding acquisition, P.A., L.M., L.C. and C.F.
