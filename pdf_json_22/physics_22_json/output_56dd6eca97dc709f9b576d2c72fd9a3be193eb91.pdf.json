    "abstractText": "In this paper, plasma silver (Ag) modified zinc oxide (ZnO) (AZO) was used to form AZO nanomaterials (including AZO nanofilms (NFm), AZO nanowires (NWs) and AZO nanoflowers (NFw)) in a two-stepcontrolled manner to investigate the effect of compounding different contents of Ag on the linear optical aspects of ZnO materials. The growth mechanism of the AZO nanomaterials with different strategies is discussed. If Ag nanoparticles (NPs) grow on the ZnO NFm surface, they first grow with ZnO as the core and then self-core into islands, which are undoubtedly influenced by factors such as the growth mechanism of ZnO as well as Ag. If Ag is grown on the surface of the ZnO NWs and ZnO NFw, it is more likely to self-core owing to factors such as the roughness of the ZnO NWs and ZnO NFw surfaces. The AZO nanomaterials have excellent optical properties based on the surface plasmon resonance, local electromagnetic field and charge transfer mechanism between Ag and ZnO. With the increase in Ag content, the absorption edges of AZO NFm are red-shifted, and the absorption edges of AZO NWs and AZO NFw are first blue-shifted and then red-shifted. The results show that AZO nanomaterials prepared using different methods not only have different growth morphologies, but also have different optical properties with potential for the preparation of optical devices.",

The growth mechanism of the AZO nanomaterials with different\nstrategies is discussed. If Ag nanoparticles (NPs) grow on the ZnO NFm surface, they first grow with ZnO\nas the core and then self-core into islands, which are undoubtedly influenced by factors such as the\ngrowth mechanism of ZnO as well as Ag. If Ag is grown on the surface of the ZnO NWs and ZnO NFw, it\nis more likely to self-core owing to factors such as the roughness of the ZnO NWs and ZnO NFw\nsurfaces. The AZO nanomaterials have excellent optical properties based on the surface plasmon\nresonance, local electromagnetic field and charge transfer mechanism between Ag and ZnO. With the\nincrease in Ag content, the absorption edges of AZO NFm are red-shifted, and the absorption edges of\nAZO NWs and AZO NFw are first blue-shifted and then red-shifted.

            "text": "ZnO is one of the most important and promising materials, and is used in many elds, such as ultraviolet (UV) light emitters,1 gas sensors,2 and transparent conductive contacts,3 owing to its excellent optoelectronic properties and unique semiconductor characteristics. It has also been widely used in the elds of photocatalysis4 and additives5 owing to its chemical properties, such as catalysis and excellent antibacterial effects. However, many properties of ZnO are unsatisfactory, mainly due to its inherent defects (oxygen vacancy and zinc interstitial),6 low electron\u2013hole separation rate7 and other factors. In order to expand the potential applications and improve the application properties of ZnO, many researchers have tried to modify ZnO with different materials, such as metals7 and semiconductors.8 Among them, ZnO compounded with metallic nanoparticles (NPs) has received signicant attention, such as Sr/ZnO,9\u201311 Cu/ ZnO,12,13 Ag/ZnO,13\u201315 Au/ZnO,16,17 Ce/ZnO,18,19 and so forth. Kumar et al. proposed that metal\u2013semiconductor nanocomposite lms have a wide range of promising applications in plasma and photonic elds, such as optical sensing, photoemitters, and photoelectric conversion elds.14 Noble metal\nndgap Materials, Ministry of Education, ing, Harbin Normal University, Harbin,\nil: yaochengbao5@163.com\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nnanoparticle structures have attracted signicant attention owing to their unique localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) (i.e., oscillations of free electrons generating large electric elds on the surface of metal nanostructures under external light irradiation). For example, Zuo et al. proposed that noble metal NPs can induce LSPR to activate photocatalytic hydrogen precipitation reaction (HER) and to enhance the luminescence or absorption ability of the semiconductors. For biochemical sensing applications, noble metal NPs facilitate electron transport in electrochemical processes.31 Zhang et al. proposed that the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of noble metals can extend the response range of incident light, enrich the transmittance of photoelectrons in electrodes, prolong the lifetime of electrons, and suppress the light production of electron holes in composites.35 In these coupled systems, Ag acts as an amphoteric dopant20 to produce a substituted acceptor state21 at the zinc site, which has become an active area of research. Meanwhile, Ag is structurally similar to ZnO, but there are different dielectric constants between them, which result in collective oscillations of the conduction band (CB) electrons in Ag nanostructures. The high corrosion and oxidation resistance of metallic Ag, as well as its high electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and high optical reectivity make it valuable for research.13 For example, Mahatha et al. suggested that owing to the inertness of Ag at room temperature, Ag can be epitaxially grown on the MoS2 surface, forming\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3013\u20133026 | 3013\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

For example, Ievtushenko et al.22 obtained the Ag decorated ZnO nanorods on a silicon substrate using the CVD method and reported the surface morphology and near-band edge emission of the samples. Wang et al.23 successfully synthesized Ag nanoparticles decorated 3D ower like Zn. O. D\u0142ugosz et al.24 synthesized ZnO\u2013Ag NPs using the continuous microwave method and studied the structure, crystallinity and photocatalytic properties of the sample modied with metallic Ag. In previous studies by our group, AZO nanowires (NWs) and nanoowers (NFw) were synthesized using a two-step CVD composite magnetron sputtering (MS) method and a two-step HT composite MS method,34,35 respectively. The growth structures and linear and nonlinear optical properties of both were investigated. So far, studies on the AZO nanomaterials are relatively mature, but there are few studies on the preparation of AZO nanolms (NFm) using two-step MS, and the growth mechanism and optical properties of AZO nanomaterials prepared using different growth strategies.\nIn this paper, we designed a two-step MS to prepare AZO NFm and compared and summarized the growth mechanism and optical characteristics with those of the AZO NWs and AZO NFw. The morphology, structure, growth mechanism and optical properties of the AZO samples were investigated to probe the photoelectric conversion mechanism and electron transfer mechanism under the radiation photon eld. The experimental results show that the AZO NFm nanomaterials have excellent UV properties compared with those of the unmodied ZnO nanomaterials. Our study provides a reference for studying the construction, properties and applications of composite systems of noble metal\u2013ZnO materials."

The EDS results demonstrate the ratio of the Ag, O and Zn atomic contents. With this increase in the Ag sputtering time, the number of Ag particles deposited increases. However, the relative content of Ag atoms rst increases and then decreases, the relative content of the Zn atoms rst decreases, then increases and then decreases, and the relative content of the O atoms rst increases, then decreases and nally increases. To explain the above phenomenon, we speculate that (i): as the deposition time of the Ag particles increases, Ag is slightly oxidized, resulting in an increase in the phase content of the Ag atoms with O atoms and a decrease in the relative proportion of Zn atoms. However, the thickness of Ag oxidation is low and the relative content of O atoms cannot increase continuously. (ii): When depositing Ag particles on ZnO NFm, it is equivalent to the secondary heat treatment of ZnO NFm, which will cause O atoms to overow while enhancing the crystallinity of ZnO NFm.

In summary, the sputtering time of Ag particles must be carefully controlled in order to obtain the optimum atomic content of the AZO NFm.\nFig. 3b shows the XRD spectra of the AZO-time NFm and ZnO NFm, two distinct diffraction peaks for (002) (2q \u00bc 34.21 ) and (110) (2q \u00bc 56.31 ) appear for the pure ZnO NFm, which prove that ZnO NFm has a preferential growth orientation in the (002) and (110) directions. The diffraction peak of the AZO NFm is shied to the right with respect to pure ZnO NFm, and the angle of the shi increases with the increasing sputtering time of the Ag particles. The reason for this may be: (i) the small amount of Ag doping into ZnO, which distorts the lattice to shi the diffraction peaks of pure ZnO.35 (ii) The small shi in the ZnO NFm diffraction peak is a result of the interfacial stress caused by the contact between the Ag and ZnO.33 Meanwhile, Ag suppresses the diffraction intensity of ZnO in the (100) and (002) directions, and the diffraction peaks in the (002) direction of AZO-100 s NFm and AZO-200 s NFm completely disappeared.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3013\u20133026 | 3015\nFig. 3 Particle size distribution (ai\u2013avi) and XRD (bi\u2013biii) patterns of pure ZnO and AZO NFm with different sputtering time.\nTable 1 Peak position (q), FWHM, lattice constant (cf), average crystallite size (D), and crystallinity of the samples\nParameter ZnONFm AZO-50 s NFm AZO-100 s NFm AZO-150 s NFm AZO-200 s NFm\na/nm 3.25 5.85 5.83 5.85 5.88 b/nm 3.25 3.48 3.47 3.48 3.48 c/nm 5.21 5.49 5.48 5.50 5.49 d/nm 2.617 2.611 2.614 2.610 2.599 D/nm 14.98 16.04 19.59 38.70 27.79 q/ 34.242 34.319 34.280 34.334 34.482 FWHM/nm 0.45 0.35 0.46 0.40 0.39 Crystallinity 59.98 93.93 85.51 45.61 61.39 Standard deviation 52.63 27.44 37.11 115.92 53.91\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Based on the diameter grain diagram of the AZO NFm shown in Fig. 3a, the standard deviation and mean values of the particle sizes of AZO and pure ZnO were calculated as shown in Table 1. The order of the diameter grain size of AZO NFm at different sputtering times is: AZO-150 s NFm > AZO-200 s NFm > AZO-100 s NFm > AZO-50 s NFm > pure ZnO NFm. However, the crystallinity values of samples with different sputtering times vary in the following order: AZO-50 s NFm > AZO-100 s NFm > AZO200 s NFm > ZnO NFm > AZO-150 s NFm. As a possible reason for the above changes, rstly, we conjecture that it is due to the need to maintain a constant temperature for heat treatment of the substrate ZnO NFm during the sputtering of Ag particles, which undoubtedly leads to recrystallization of the ZnO NFm.36,37 This hypothesis can be veried by comparing the SEM images of the unannealed and annealed ZnO NFm in Fig. 2a and c. Secondly, based on Fig. 3a and the combined Chokrauer combination theory, the redistribution of the size of the nuclei also occurs at reduced temperatures. According to Ostwald ripening theory, the smaller grains present in the deposited lm are consumed by larger grains. Finally, the temperature during the secondary sputtering of Ag particles affects the sublimation energy of the crystal, and a decrease in the temperature increases the sublimation energy.39 The change in the ratio of sublimation energy to desorption energy affects the growth morphology of the grains25 and thus the crystallinity of ZnO NFm. These theories explain the reason for the particle variation. According to the previous measurements, the Ag particle size is smaller than that of ZnO, thus the particle size is smaller if the Ag particle grows in its own nucleation. In the AFM spectra of ZnO NFm (see Fig. 2ai\u2013aiii) and AZO NFm-150 s (see Fig. 2bi\u2013 biii), combined with Fig. 2f\u2013I, as well as Fig. 3a, it was found that when the sputtering time is 50 s the Ag growth is nucleated with ZnO, but the particle size is not uniform, because not all of the ZnO is nucleated for Ag growth. As the sputtering time increases to 100 s, the particle size becomes larger and the Ag particles continue to grow with ZnO as nuclei, while Ag itself has not yet undergone nucleation growth. When the sputtering time reaches 150 s, the average grain size reaches its maximum, and the nucleation growth of ZnO reaches its peak at this time. When the sputtering time reaches 200 s, the average grain size becomes smaller owing to the nucleation growth of the Ag particles themselves at this time. The above ndings demonstrate that the compounding of the Ag particles and the recrystallization process of ZnO NFm by heat treatment both effect the crystallinity and diameter grain size of the AZO NFm. The effect of the different crystallinities and grain sizes on the optical properties of AZO is explained in detail in the UV and PL analysis.\nFig. 4 shows the SEM, EDS, XRD, TEM, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images of the AZO NWs prepared using CVD composite MS. The sputtering times of Ag were\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The growth process of the AZO NWs is shown in Fig. 4ai\u2013av. In Fig. 4b\u2013f, the SEM and TEM results show that the Ag NPs were adsorbed on ZnO NWs in the form of monomers. The Ag particles with a hemispherical shape were uniformly distributed on ZnO NWs, with the increase in the sputtering time (0\u2013200 s), the density and size of the Ag NPs increased, but when the sputtering time increased to a certain value (150 s), the Ag NPs started to nucleate themselves and agglomeration occurred. In Fig. 4h, the EDS results show that with the increase of Ag sputtering time, the atom relative content of Ag increases, the atom content of Zn decreases, and the atom content of O increases. Theoretically, the atomic ratio of Zn to O in the ZnO materials should be 1 : 1. However, owing to the intrinsic donor defects of ZnO, namely the oxygen vacancy (VO) and zinc interstitial (IZn), there is a gap between the atomic ratio of Zn to O in most ZnO materials and the theoretical value. As the sputtering time of the Ag particles increases, the atomic ratio of Zn to O in AZO NWs and AZO NFm gradually adjusts from greater than 2 : 1 to approximately 1 : 1, indicating that based on the recombination of Ag NPs the intrinsic defects of ZnO have beenmodied. The XRD spectra of the AZO NWs are shown in Fig. 4g. The Ag NPs have a (200) peak at the position 2q \u00bc 44.5 (JCPDS no. 04 0783), and the peak intensity of (200) increases with the increase in the Ag sputtering time. The characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnO are (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103), indicating that ZnO has a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS card no. 76-704), and the diffraction peak for the AZO NWs shows almost no deviation compared with pure ZnO.\nThe growth process for the AZO-time NFw is shown in Fig. 5a, and the FE-SEMmorphologies of the pure ZnO NFw and AZO-time NFw are shown in Fig. 5b\u2013biii and c\u2013f, respectively. The sputtering times of the Ag NPs were kept at 0 s (ZnO NFw), 50 s (AZO-50 s NFw), 100 s (AZO 100 s NFw), 150 s (AZO-150 s NFw), and 200 s (AZO-200 s NFw). From the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of Fig. 5cii\u2013fi, it can be seen that the average diameter of the Ag NPs is a few nanometers and ellipsoidal Ag NPs are uniformly attached to the surface of ZnO NFw in the form of monomers. The SAED plots (see Fig. 5cii\u2013fii) show that both the AZO NFw and ZnO NFw are polycrystalline and have a high crystalline quality, and the compounding of the Ag NPs did not change the structure of ZnO NFw. As the Ag NPs are adsorbed on the nucleus edge of the ZnO NFw by reducing the interfacial energy of ZnO NFw, the Ag NPs are not uniformly distributed on the surface of the AZO NFw. The distribution of EDS elements indicates the presence of AZO NFw, and signicant Ag, Zn and O peaks are observed in the AZO NFw as shown in Fig. 5h. As the sputtering time for the Ag particles increases, the relative content of the Ag and Zn atoms increases, and the relative content of the O atoms decreases. The increase in the ratio of the relative atomic content of Zn to O means the increased number of intrinsic sender defects in AZO NFw will capture more electrons and thus prolong the photogenerated electron\u2013hole lifetime.

Analysis of the XRD results of the AZO-time NFw has been fully demonstrated in previous work from this group,40 and is not described in detail here.\nDiffraction peaks of the singlet Ag elements were not observed in the AZO NFm, and we could not identify the exact state of the Ag elements. Therefore, we performed XPS analysis of AZO-150 s NFm. In Fig. 6b, the peaks at 1024.6 and 1047.6 eV correspond to the electronic states of Zn3/2 and Zn1/2, respectively, corresponding to the binding energy of Zn2+ in ZnO.41 Owing to the presence of AgxOy in the sample, the increase of VO\n3018 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3013\u20133026\non the ZnO surface leads to a shi of the Zn3/2 and Zn1/2 peaks to higher positions, with a valence difference between the two peaks of about 23 eV. In Fig. 6d, the peaks at 370.3 and 376.3 eV correspond to the electronic states of Ag5/2 and Ag3/2, respectively. The energy difference (6.0 eV) between the two Ag peaks indicates the presence of Ag in the positive valence state, as well as in the singlet form. Compared to the standard electronic binding energy of Ag (368.2 eV, 374.2 eV),50 among our AZO NFm preparations, Ag showed a higher binding energy. This is related to the interaction of Ag with ZnO.

The XPS results conrmed the successful preparation of AZO NFm, with some Ag adsorbed on the ZnO surface in the form of a singlet. The rest of the Ag doped into the ZnO lattice veries our above speculation.\nThe growth mechanism of the AZO NFm is shown schematically in Fig. 7a.

ZnO NFm has a layer-by-layer growth at the top of the island. According to the crystal nucleation theory,39 the growth mechanism belongs to the layered solidication model because the bonding between the generated atoms is weaker than the bonding between the substrates, that is, the desorption energy (K1) is larger than the sublimation energy (K2). In Fig. 7aiv\u2013avi, the Ag NPs do not easily replace the Zn position when Ag is under the lower deposition temperature, and the Ag NPs more easily adsorb onto the ZnO NFm surface.

When the Ag particles completely cover the ZnO NFm surface, the lm surface will still become partially bumpy. At the same time, when the desorption energy of Ag to itself is less than the sublimation energy, this leads to the nucleation and growth of Ag by itself. The above described results theoretically conrm our previous conjecture about the growth mechanism of the thin lm.\nThe growth mechanism of the ZnO NWs can be explained by the gas\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) mechanism.43\u201345 The growth mechanism diagram of ZnO NWs is shown in Fig. 7b, this shows that the vacuum heat treatment causes the formation of gold nanodroplets on the gold-plated substrate, and the ZnO powder is adsorbed and dissolved in the droplets aer vacuum heat treatment (see Fig. 7bii). If the dissolution limit is reached, the supersaturated ZnO precipitates from the droplet surface and forms nuclei (Fig. 7biii), which eventually form a onedimensional structure, for example, ZnO NWs (Fig. 7biv\u2013bvi). Gold plays a catalytic role here and the gold droplets also guide the growth of ZnO NWs on the substrate. Therefore, what nally appears is the tilted growth of the ZnO NWs (see Fig. 7bvi). As the desorption energy of the Ag on ZnO is greater than the sublimation energy of Ag, Ag NPs are hemispherically and uniformly adsorbed on the ZnO NWs (Fig. 7bvii). The biggest difference between ZnO NWs and ZnO NFm is that the surface of the ZnO NWs is relatively smooth, therefore the morphology of the Ag growing on the surface of the ZnO NWs is not affected by the surface inhomogeneity. This leads to the existence of Ag, mainly in the form of solid Ag, which is smaller than the critical\n3020 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3013\u20133026\nnucleus size. As a result, the morphology of Ag forms a spherical core, showing a very typical hemispherical shape. Under the same Ar ux and vacuum conditions, Ag does not readily form oxides, which is clearly related to the Ag growth environment. Comparison of the XRD peak sharpness indicates that the crystallinity of AZO NWs is better than that of the AZO NFm. One reason is that the AZO NWs grow at a high temperature and there is no recrystallization process aer compounding with Ag. Meanwhile, the higher temperature in the preparation of AZO NWs is favorable for the synthesis of high crystallinity composites; on the other hand, the presence of gold droplets during the growth of AZO NWs promotes the growth of AZO NWs in one direction and enhances its crystallinity. The growth mechanisms of ZnO NFw and AZO NFw are shown in Fig. 7c. During the growth of the ZnO NFw, hexamethyltetramine (HMT) provides OH and Zn(NO3)2 provides Zn\n2+ (Fig. 7cii). OH combines with Zn2+ to form Zn(OH)2 (see Fig. 7ciii), and Zn(OH)2 is decomposed and oxidized by heating to form ZnO nuclei that gradually form the ower-like structure of ZnO NFw. Subsequently, Ag particles are deposited on the surface of the ZnO NFw by MS to form AZO NFw (Fig. 7cviii).\nIn summary, no matter which preparation method is used for the fabrication of the ZnO nanostructures, CVD or MS, different growth methods lead to very different morphologies, growth processes, and crystals of ZnO samples. Although their growth mechanisms are different, they all have a common strong nucleation growth, which is undoubtedly related to factors such as the preferential growth mechanism of particles, defect nucleation, lattice-mismatch induced-stress, and so\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

These factors make ZnO grow in a more optimal direction while restricting the growth in other directions. This is the reason why one dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructures are mostly linear and rod-like, while 2D ZnO nanostructures, such as ZnO NFm, are mostly island-like when grown, and 3D ZnO nanostructures are ower-like.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Fig. 8a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of AZO NFm.

The absorption intensity of the AZO NFm is greater than that of the ZnO NFm. With the increase in the sputtering time of the Ag particles, the absorption intensity of the AZO NFm decreases instead. Fig. 8b and c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the AZO NWs, AZO NFw, ZnO NWs and AZO NFw, respectively. The intensity of the absorption peaks of the AZO NWs and AZO NFw decreases and then increases with the increase in the Ag sputtering time. The reasons for the above phenomenon may be (i) the peak at 380 nm corresponds to the transverse plasmon resonance of Ag,47 and the intrinsic absorption peak of pure ZnO is located at 378 nm, forming a double excited state when ZnO and Ag are excited by the same photon,51 thus the photon can be absorbed, intensied, and diverted to ZnO by the Ag NPs to perform further absorption. (ii) As the work of the Ag function is larger than that of ZnO, there is charge transfer if Ag is in contact with ZnO, and the electron loss on the Ag surface weakens the ZnO absorption, and the Schottky contact (SB)51 between Ag and ZnO facilitates ZnO electron\u2013hole separation, which enhances the ZnO photon absorption. (iii) The number of Ag NPs increases with the increase in the Ag particle sputtering time, and when the ZnO surface is covered by metallic Ag the enhancement of the mirror effect of Ag makes the light absorption performance of ZnO weaker.\nFrom the results of the UV-vis experiments, it can be seen that the morphology of ZnO affects the position and intensity of\n3022 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3013\u20133026\nthe AZO absorption peaks. The AZO NFm prepared using the two-step MS method has excellent photo absorption properties, while the highest absorption peak intensity is observed for the AZO-50 s NFm. In Fig. 8a\u2013c, different dimensions (1\u20133D) of ZnO were found to affect its optical absorption edge and energy band gap. The band gap values of the AZO composites are all smaller than those of ZnO as determined by the position of the absorption edge of AZO, which is due to the increase in defects and impurities in AZO.\nThe results of room temperature PL experiments for ZnO NFm and AZO NFm are shown in Fig. 9a\u2013aii, both of which have signicant emission peaks at 385, 590, 630, and 770 nm. The UV emission (385 nm) corresponds to the near-band edge emission (NBE),43,44 which originates from the free exciton radiation complex. Compared to ZnO NFm, the AZO NFmUV emission, as well as the intensity of the yellow-green and red-light emission located at 630 and 770 nm, respectively, are signicantly changed. In Fig. 9ai, the order of variation of the UV emission peak intensity for sputtering times (50\u2013200 s) is: ZnO NFm > AZO-50 s NFm > AZO-100 s NFm > AZO-200 s NFm > AZO-150 s NFm. The yellow-green and red-light emissions are caused by VO or IZn gap defects electron\u2013hole complex (DL)43,44 (see Fig. 9aii), the yellow-green and red luminescence intensities vary in the following order: ZnO NFm > AZO-100 s NFm > AZO-200 s NFm > AZO-50 s NFm > AZO-150 s NFm. The reasons for the change in the PL intensity of ZnO are as follows: rstly the adsorption of Ag changes the defect state and the number of exciton pairs on the surface of ZnO,48 the abundant surface state is favorable for the PL signal of ZnO.

The large size mismatch between the optical wavelength and the ZnO excitons leads to weak light\u2013matter interactions, which hinder efficient energy conversion. In contrast, the plasma of Ag as a collective oscillation mode of electrons can break the diffraction limit and strongly couple with the external eld to obtain a large neareld enhancement. This enhanced local eld can interact strongly with the neighboring ZnO exciton pairs, and the excitons appearing in the plasma near eld can in turn change the optical properties of the plasma.52 Finally, ZnO and Ag form semiconductor\u2013metal junctions, and the over doping of Ag forms AgxOy, and so forth, producing a strong non-radiative complex Auger process.22,49 The Auger process will rapidly deplete the electron\u2013hole pairs, reducing the PL intensity.\nFor yellow, green and red emission peaks, pure ZnO NFm is stronger than the ZnO NWs (see Fig. 9a and b), but the UV emission intensity of ZnO NFm is reduced and the yellow-green emission intensity of the ZnO NWs is smaller than that of ZnO NFm. The Ag composite decreases the NEB and DL emissions of the ZnO NWs, which are different from those of the ZnO NFm composite Ag. This is not only a result of the decrease in the PL strength caused by the SB and Auger process between Ag and ZnO, but also the growth mechanism of ZnO. As the crystallinity of ZnO NWs is stronger than that of ZnO NFm, there are fewer defects and fewer captured electrons, therefore the UV emission intensity of the ZnO NWs is higher and the emission in the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nvisible region is lower. Fig. 9c shows the PL diagram of the pure ZnO NFw and AZO NFw. Under the excitation laser with a wavelength of 325 nm, Fig. 9ci and cii, respectively, shows obvious luminescence characteristics in the UV and visible regions. It can be seen from Fig. 9ci that the UV emission peak is located at 387 nm, which is caused by the recombination of the free excitons. In Fig. 9cii, the central wavelengths of the green and yellow emissions are located at 530 and 594 nm, respectively. Owing to the defects in VO and IZn,46 the visible emission band is considered to be close to the defect luminescence. The green luminescence of AZO NFw comes from the VO and surface states, or the combination of holes and electronic states of a specic defect.46 It can be seen from Fig. 9ci and cii that the luminous peak intensity of AZO NFw in the visible region is higher than that of pure ZnO NFw, this is mainly the result of the interaction between the SPR of the Ag NPs and the incident electromagnetic eld of the 325 nm laser. The above experimental results show that local eld enhancement close to the Ag NPs can improve the electron excitation rate of the ZnO.46 When the electron excitation rate is greater than the electron\u2013hole recombination rate, the PL emission peak of AZO is stronger than that of ZnO. When the electron excitation rate is less than the electron\u2013hole recombination rate, the result is reversed. Moreover, AZO composites with different growth mechanisms have different luminescence characteristics. The plasma nature of the Ag NPs leads to a more efficient conversion of the captured electrons into excited light, suggesting that plasma-\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3013\u20133026 | 3023\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The results show that the Ag NPs grow on the surface of ZnO NFm, rst with ZnO as the core and then self-nucleated, which is undoubtedly affected by the island growth of ZnO NFm and the ES barrier factor. When Ag grows on ZnO NWs and ZnO NFw, Ag is more likely to self-nucleate owing to the roughness of the ZnO NWs and ZnO NFw. The SEM and TEM results show that the content and distribution of Ag can be controlled by adjusting the sputtering time of Ag. The XRD results show that Ag is more likely to combine with oxygen in ZnO NFm prepared by MS owing to the inuence of the growth mechanism, resulting in AgxOy and the slightly lower crystallinity of AZO NFm. However, when Ag is compounded on the ZnO NWs and ZnO NFw, they mostly exist in the form of Ag monomers with a good crystallinity. The absorption peak intensity of AZO NFm changes with the increase in the Ag sputtering time, and AZO-50 s NFm has the strongest absorption peak in the UV region. The UV results of the AZO NWs and AZO NFw show that the deposition of Ag particles decreases the absorption intensity of ZnO in the full wave range. In addition, the PL results of AZO nanomaterials showed that the emission peak of AZO NFm was weaker than that of the pure ZnO nanomaterials, and the PL peak of the AZO NWs and AZO NFw was stronger than that of the pure ZnO nanomaterials. The results show that AZO nanomaterials with different morphologies can be used in different optical applications. AZO materials have great potential for applications in at panel displays, high brightness electron sources, eld emission devices and solar cells."
