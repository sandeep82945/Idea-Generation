    "abstractText": "A pair density wave (PDW) is a superconducting (SC) state with spatially modulated order parameter. Although much is known about the properties of the PDW state, its realization in microscopic models with divergent susceptibility has been challenging. Here we report a densitymatrix renormalization group study of a three-band Hubbard model (also known as the Emery model) for cuprates on long two-leg square cylinders. Upon light doping, we find that the ground state of the system is consistent with that of a PDW state with mutually commensurate and powerlaw SC, charge (CDW) and spin (SDW) density wave correlations. The SC correlations are dominant between neighboring Cu sites with d-wave pairing symmetry. Interestingly, we find that the nearneighbor interactions, especially the near-neighbor attractive Vpd interaction between neighboring Cu and oxygen sites, can notably enhance the SC correlations while simultaneously suppressing the CDW correlations. For a modestly strong attractive Vpd, the SC correlations become quasi-longranged with a divergent PDW susceptibility.",

Although much is known about the properties of the PDW state, its realization in microscopic models with divergent susceptibility has been challenging. Here we report a densitymatrix renormalization group study of a three-band Hubbard model (also known as the Emery model) for cuprates on long two-leg square cylinders. Upon light doping, we find that the ground state of the system is consistent with that of a PDW state with mutually commensurate and powerlaw SC, charge (CDW) and spin (SDW) density wave correlations. The SC correlations are dominant between neighboring Cu sites with d-wave pairing symmetry. Interestingly, we find that the nearneighbor interactions, especially the near-neighbor attractive Vpd interaction between neighboring Cu and oxygen sites, can notably enhance the SC correlations while simultaneously suppressing the CDW correlations. For a modestly strong attractive Vpd, the SC correlations become quasi-longranged with a divergent PDW susceptibility.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe pair density wave (PDW) is a novel superconducting (SC) state in which the Cooper pairs carry finite center-of-mass momentum and the SC order parameter varies periodically in space in such a way that its spatial average vanishes [1\u20134]. The first example of PDW is the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in which the PDW state is more stable than the spatially uniform SC state when the Fermi surfaces are split by an external magnetic field [5, 6]. The PDW state has been discussed as a leading candidate state to understand the physics of cuprate high-temperature superconductors and other strongly correlated systems, where it has been proposed that various phases, including the unconventional superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) orders, can emerge by partially melting the PDW state [2\u20134, 7]. Recently, intense interest in the PDW state has emerged due to experimental observations in underdoped cuprate superconductors, where signatures of PDW states have been observed via local Cooper pair tunneling and scanning tunneling microscopy in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (BSCCO) [8\u201311] and the dynamical inter-layer decoupling in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 (LBCO) [12\u201318]. Signatures of PDW states have also been reported in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 [19] and monolayer iron-based highTc Fe(Te,Se) films [20].\nWhile much is known about the properties of the PDW state [1\u20134, 16, 17, 21], there are very few microscopic models which are shown to have PDW ground states [22\u201329] and especially no PDW long-range order has been established in unbiased calculations in two or higher dimensions. These include the one-dimensional (1D) Kondo-Heisenberg model [22], the extended HubbardHeisenberg model on two-leg ladder [23], generalized t-J\n\u2217 hcjiang@stanford.edu\nand Hubbard models [24\u201327] and strong coupling limit of Holstein-Hubbard model [28, 29]. However, even in quasi-1D systems such as ladders, no reported evidence of PDW quasi-long-range order with divergent susceptibility \u2013 the closest one can have to PDW long-range order \u2013 in standard Hubbard model on any systems including two-leg ladder, especially that are closely related to real materials.\nIn the present work, we consider the three-band Hubbard model (also known as the Emery model) on the square lattice, which has long been proposed as one of the minimal models to describe the properties of cuprate high-temperature superconductors [30\u201334], with the goal of determining whether this model supports PDW order. We employ density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [35] to study the lightly hole doped three-band Hubbard model [33] on long two-leg square cylinders. Our main results are that the ground state of the system is consistent with that of a PDW state with power-law and mutually commensurate SC, CDW and SDW correlations. The SC correlations oscillate periodically and change sign in real space. The PDW ordering wavevector Q \u2248 2\u03c0\u03b4 is incommensurate and hole doping density \u03b4 dependent. The Cooper pairing is dominant between neighboring Cu sites with d-wave symmetry. Interestingly, we find that near-neighbor attractions, especially Vpd between neighboring Cu and O sites, can notably enhance the SC correlations while suppressing the CDW correlations. For modestly strong near-neighbor attractions, the SC correlations become quasi-long-ranged with a divergent PDW susceptibility."

Following [33], we have fixed the phases of orbitals such that the signs of hopping matrix elements remain the same throughout the lattice and are positive [36]. We set tpd = 1 as the energy unit and take a canonical set of parameters tpp = 0.5, Ud = 8, Up = 3, \u2206pd = 3 for cuprates [33, 37, 38]. We study the ground state properties of the system as a function of Vpd and Vpp.\nIn the present study, we take the lattice geometry to be cylindrical with periodic/open boundary condition in the e2/e1 direction, as shown in Fig.1. We focus on twoleg cylinders with width Ly = 2 and length up to Lx=96, where Lx and Ly are the number of unit cells in the e1 and e2 directions, respectively. The total number of sites is N = 3LxLy + 2Ly = 3Nu+ 2Ly, where Nu is the number of unit cell. The overall hole density of the system is defined as \u03c1 = 1 + \u03b4, where \u03b4 = Nh/Nu [39] and Nh de-\nnote the hole doping concentration and number of doped holes away from half-filling, respectively. We consider both \u03b4 = 1/12 and \u03b4 = 1/8 hole doping concentrations and perform up to 157 sweeps and keep up to m = 25000 number of states with a typical truncation error \u223c 10\u22129."

As the ground state with an even number of holes always have total spin 0, we focus on spin-singlet SC correlation [40], which is defined as\n\u03a6\u03b1\u03b2(r) = \u3008\u2206\u0302\u2020\u03b1(x0, y0)\u2206\u0302\u03b2(x0 + r, y0)\u3009.

(x0, y0) is a reference bond with x0 \u223c Lx/4, r is the distance between two bonds in the e1 direction. We have calculated different components of the SC correlations, including \u03a6aa, \u03a6ab, \u03a6bb, \u03a6dd(r), \u03a6dd\u0304(r), \u03a6d\u0304d\u0304(r), \u03a6hh, \u03a6uu and \u03a6uh and find that \u03a6hh(r) and \u03a6uu(r) exhibit the strongest SC correlations as shown in Fig.2A, i.e. the pairing is dominant between neighboring Cu sites. The pairing symmetry is consistent with d-wave, which is characterized by the fact \u03a6uu(r) \u223c \u03a6hh(r) \u223c \u2212\u03a6uh(r).\nThe spatial distribution of SC correlations \u03a6hh(r) for the three representative choices of parameters are shown in Fig.2C-D: \u03a6hh(r) exhibits clear spatial oscillations which can be well fitted by \u03a6hh(r) \u223c f(r)\u03c6hh(r) for a large region of r, where f(r) sets the envelope and \u03c6hh(r) determines the spatial oscillation. At long distances, the envelope function f(r) is consistent with a power-law decay f(r) = A \u2217 r\u2212Ksc with a Luttinger exponent Ksc. For instance, the extracted exponent Ksc = 3.4(2) at Vpd = 1.0 and Vpp = 0.75, Ksc = 2.4(1) at Vpd = 0 and Vpp = 0, and Ksc = 1.80(8) at Vpd = \u22121.0 even Vpp = 0. It is worth emphasizing that the SC correlations can be notably enhanced by either reducing the NN repulsion or increasing the NN attraction, which is similar to the single-band Hubbard model [41\u201343]. This is directly supported by the SC correlation in Fig.2B and the value of Ksc mentioned above. More complete results of Ksc for \u03a6hh and \u03a6uu at \u03b4 = 1/8 and \u03b4 = 1/12 are shown in Fig.3A. This shows that the static PDW susceptibility diverges as \u03c7pdw \u223c T\u2212(2\u2212Ksc) since Ksc < 2 as T \u2192 0. As far as we know, to date, this is the strongest indication of PDW order that has been found in any DMRG study in doped Hubbard model on the square lattice.\nThe spatial oscillation of the SC correlations \u03a6(r) is characterized by the normalized function \u03c6(r) = \u03a6(r)/f(r) as mentioned above. Examples of \u03c6hh(r) for the representative choices of parameters are shown in Fig.2C-D for \u03b4 = 1/8 and \u03b4 = 1/12, respectively. It is clear that \u03c6hh(r) oscillates periodically in real space and can be well fitted by \u03c6hh(r) \u223c sin(Qr + \u03b8), which is\n3\nconsistent with that of a PDW state [4]. The PDW ordering wavevector Q is incommensurate and hole doping dependent as Q \u2248 2\u03c0\u03b4, corresponding to a wavelength \u03bbsc \u2248 1/\u03b4, e.g., \u03bbsc \u2248 8 at \u03b4 = 1/8 and \u03bbsc \u2248 12 at \u03b4 = 1/12 as shown in Fig.2C-D. This is distinct with Q \u2248 4\u03c0\u03b4 in a qualitatively different system [25]."

Different from the single-band Hubbard model on square lattice [44\u201348], the spatial oscillation of n\u03b1(x) in the three-band Hubbard model is characterized by two wavevectors at Q and 2Q, corresponding to wavelengths \u03bbQ \u2248 1/\u03b4 and \u03bb2Q \u2248 1/2\u03b4, respectively. Examples of ncu(x) and noy(x) for two representative sets of parameters are shown in Fig.4A-B.\nAt long distances, the spatial decay of the CDW correlation is dominated by a power-law with Luttinger exponent Kc, which can be obtained by fitting the charge density oscillations (Friedel oscillations) induced by the boundaries of the cylinder [49]\nn\u03b1(x) = AQ \u2217 cos(Qx+ \u03c61) \u2217 x\u2212Kc(\u03b1)/2 (3) + A2Q \u2217 cos(2Qx+ \u03c62) \u2217 x\u2212Kc(\u03b1)/2 + n0(\u03b1).\nHere AQ and A2Q are CDW amplitudes, \u03c61 and \u03c62 are phase shifts, n0 is the mean density, and Q \u2248 2\u03c0\u03b4. Similar with the single-band Hubbard model on four-leg square cylinders [42], we find that the CDW strength can be notably suppressed by NN attraction evidenced by the monotonic increase of Kc with the increase of NN attraction |Vpd| in Fig.3B. Examples of Kc at \u03b4 = 1/8 and Vpp = 0 are Kc(Cu)=2.29(5) and Kc(Oy)=2.25(5) for Vpd=0, and Kc(Cu)=2.52(7) and Kc(Oy)=2.54(7) for Vpd=-1. More complete results are shown in Fig.3B.\nInterestingly, we find that the NN attraction can notably enhance the charge oscillation at Q while suppressing the charge oscillation at 2Q, evidenced by the CDW\n4\namplitudes AQ and A2Q as shown in Fig.3D. The charge oscillation is dominant at 2Q for strong NN repulsion, e.g., A2Q \u2248 10AQ at Vpd = 1.0 and Vpp = 0.75. When the NN interaction is weak, the charge oscillations at both Q and 2Q become comparable with each other, e.g., A2Q \u2248 AQ at Vpd = Vpp = 0 in Fig.3D. However, when the NN interactions become attractive, e.g., Vpd \u2264 \u22120.2 in Fig.3D, the charge oscillation at Q becomes dominant, e.g., AQ & 6A2Q at Vpd = \u22121 and Vpp = 0."

Contrary to the exponential decaying spin-spin correlation in the Luther-Emery liquid of the square lattice single-band\nHubbard model [46\u201348, 50, 51], we find that F (r) in the lightly doped three-band Hubbard model decays as a power-law F\u03b1(r) \u223c r\u2212Ks(\u03b1) at long distances, with a Luttinger exponent Ks \u223c 1.

            "heading": "VII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In summary, we have studied the ground state properties of hole-doped three-band Hubbard model on two-leg square cylinders with NN Cu-O and O-O interactions. Based on our results, we conclude that the ground state of the system is consistent with that of a PDW state, with mutually commensurate and power-law SC, CDW\nand SDW correlations. The Cooper pairing is dominant between neighboring Cu sites with d-wave symmetry. For modestly strong NN attraction, quasi-long-range PDW order with a divergent susceptibility emerges. As the critical attraction, where PDW quasi-long-range order develops, is close to that identified recently in cuprate Ba2\u2212xSrxCuO3+\u03b4 [41], it may be reasonable to expect a comparable effective NN attraction in the CuO2 plane given their chemical similarity.\nWhen the NN attraction Vpd \u2264 \u22120.2 as shown in Fig.3D, it is clear that the CDW at wavevector Q (QCDW) is dominant while the CDW at 2Q (2Q-CDW) is secondary. It is worth noting that our results suggest that the uniform SC component may be absent or at least small. If there was a small uniform component \u22060, then a Q-CDW could be generated by the product \u2206PQ\u2206 \u2217 0 with PDW order \u2206PQ. Accordingly, the 2Q-CDW could be generated by the product of PDW with itself \u2206PQ\u2206 P\u2217 \u2212Q. If this is the case, then the Q-CDW should be small as the uniform component is small, while the 2Q-CDW should be dominant. However, this is contrary to our obser-\n6\nvations especially when Vpd \u2264 \u22120.2. Alternatively, the 2Q-CDW could come from a composite of two SDW at Q, which is, however, inconsistent with our observations. This is because the 2Q-CDW weakens notably with the increase of NN attraction when Vpd \u2264 \u22120.2, while the SDW remains unchanged. Although the favored forms of order, with SC and SDW at the same Q, and CDW at both Q and 2Q, are reminiscent of those conjectured to be present in the cuprates BSCCO and LBCO [10\u2013 12, 16, 17], it is worth emphasizing that the underlying mechanism of our observations that all three orders (PDW, CDW and SDW) are all at the same Q can be very different from the stripe picture of PDW [4]. We are grateful to Steven Kivelson, Thomas Devereaux, John Tranquada, Patrick Lee and Ziqiang Wang for insightful discussions and invaluable suggestions, and Patrick Lee for pointing out the importance of three orders at the same Q.
