    "abstractText": "We consider spin-spin correlation functions for spins along a row, Rn = \u3008\u03c30,0\u03c3n,0\u3009, in the two-dimensional Ising model. We discuss a method for calculating general-n expressions for coefficients in high-temperature and low-temperature series expansions of Rn and apply it to obtain such expressions for several higher-order coefficients. In addition to their intrinsic interest, these results could be useful in the continuing quest for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation whose solution would determine Rn, analogous to the known nonlinear ordinary differential equation whose solution determines the diagonal correlation function \u3008\u03c30,0\u03c3n,n\u3009 in this model.",

INTRODUCTION\nSpin-spin correlation functions contain information about the degree of magnetic ordering in a spin model. The two-dimensional Ising model provides a valuable context in which one can obtain exact closed-form analytic expressions for these correlation functions. In thermal equilibrium at temperature T on the square lattice, the partition function of the (zero-field, isotropic, spin-1/2, nearest-neighbor) Ising model is given by\nZ = \u2211\n{\u03c3}\ne\u2212\u03b2H , (1.1)\nwhere the Hamiltonian is\nH = \u2212J \u2211\nnn\n\u03c3~r\u03c3~r\u2032 . (1.2)\nIn Eq. (1.2), \u03b2 = 1/(kBT ); the sum is over nearest-neighbor (nn) sites on the lattice; and \u03c3~r = \u00b11 is a classical spin variable defined on each lattice site. Given the well-known mapping on a bipartite lattice between the ferromagnetic (J > 0) and antiferromagnetic (J < 0) spinspin couplings [5], one can, with no loss of generality, take J > 0, and we will do this. In the following, we assume the thermodynamic limit. This model has a global Z2 symmetry, which is spontaneously broken with the onset of a nonzero spontaneous magnetization M as the temperature decreases below the critical temperature, Tc. The system undergoes a continuous, second-order phase transition at this critical temperature.\nThe two-dimensional Ising model has the appeal that many of its properties are known exactly. The free energy was calculated by Onsager [1], and an expression for the magnetization was first published by Yang [2]. A method for calculating spin-spin correlation functions in terms of Toeplitz determinants was developed by Kaufman and Onsager [3] and later extended by Montroll, Potts, and Ward [4]. Some reviews of the Ising model include [5, 6]. The critical behavior is known exactly; the thermal and magnetic exponents are yt = 1 and yh = 15/8, and hence the critical exponents \u03bd, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, etc., are known for models in the d = 2, Z2 universality class of second-order phase transitions, of which the nearest-neighbor spin-1/2 Ising model is arguably the simplest example. Generalizations to anisotropic couplings, spin s \u2265 1, and non-nearest-neighbor two-spin and multi-spin interactions preserving the Z2 symmetry that do not cause frustration are in the same universality class. The critical behavior was elucidated in the context of continuous spatial dimensionality (above the lower critical dimensionality, d = 1) via the momentum-space renormalization group and \u01eb expansion, where \u01eb = 4\u2212 d [7\u20139]. Further insight into the critical behavior of the d = 2, Z2 universality class was obtained by means of conformal algebra methods [10], which showed that the critical behavior is described by a rational conformal field theory with central charge\nc = 1/2 (reviewed, e.g., in [11]). Although the 2D Ising model is classical, it can be related to a 1D quantum spin chain [12]. In addition to these works, some other studies relevant to spin-spin correlation functions in the two-dimensional Ising model include [13]-[59].\nWhile much is thus known about the two-dimensional Ising model, there are still interesting aspects to study. Among these are various properties of the spin-spin correlation functions. We denote the spin-spin correlation function as \u3008\u03c3~r\u03c3~r\u2032\u3009, where ~r and ~r\u2032 are sites on the square lattice and \u3008O\u3009 denotes the thermal average of an operator O. Given the homogeneity of the square lattice, one can, with no loss of generality, take one spin to be located at the origin and thus consider\n\u3008\u03c3~0\u03c3~r\u3009 \u2261 C(~r) . (1.3)\nWe write ~r = (m,n) so that C(~r) \u2261 C(m,n). The spin-spin correlation function for two spins along a row is\nRn \u2261 C(n, 0) \u2261 \u3008\u03c30,0\u03c3n,0\u3009 . (1.4)\nFrom the isotropy of the spin-spin couplings in (1.2), it follows that the correlation functions for equidistantly separated spins along a row and column are equal: C(n, 0) = C(0, n). We denote the correlation function for spins along a diagonal of the lattice as\nDn \u2261 C(n, n) \u2261 \u3008\u03c30,0\u03c3n,n\u3009 . (1.5)\nNote the symmetry relation C(n, n) = C(n,\u2212n). In studying spin-spin correlation functions of the two-dimensional Ising model, one acknowledges that these are not universal in the sense of the renormalization group; that is, modifications of the model (1.1)-(1.2) such as the generalization to spin s \u2265 1 and/or addition of (nonfrustrating) non-nearest-neighbor spin-spin or multispin interactions preserving the Z2 symmetry would change \u3008\u03c30,0\u03c3m,n\u3009 without changing the universality class of the phase transition. Nevertheless, these correlation functions contain useful information about the behavior of the model. We define the following notation:\nK = \u03b2J , v = tanhK , x = v2 , z = e\u22122K , u = z2 = e\u22124K . (1.6)\nCorrelation functions are commonly expressed as functions of the variables\nk> = sinh 2(2K) , k< =\n1\nk> =\n1\nsinh2(2K) . (1.7)\nRecall that (as follows from duality) the critical point occurs at vc = zc = \u221a 2 \u2212 1, i.e., Kc = J/(kBTc) = (1/2) ln( \u221a 2 + 1), at which point k> = k< = 1. The high-temperature\n(HT) series expansions of spin-spin correlation functions are commonly expressed as series in powers of v, while the low-temperature (LT) expansions on a bipartite lattice such as the square lattice considered here, are series in powers of u.\nIn Ref. [29], Jimbo and Miwa showed that Dn can be calculated in terms of solutions to a (nonlinear, second-order) ordinary differential equation (ODE) of Painleve\u0301 VI type (see Appendix A). Subsequently, there has been a quest to find an analogous nonlinear ordinary differential equation whose solutions would yield the general spin-spin correlation function C(m,n) in this model. However, as emphasized recently in [59], this is still an open problem. Even for Rn, to our knowledge, such a generalization of the Jimbo-Miwa ODE has not been found. Indeed, in the absence of an existence proof, it is not clear if such a (nonlinear, second-order) ODE whose solutions would yield the Rn, analogous to the Jimbo-Miwa Painleve\u0301 VI ODE for Dn (see Appendix A), exists. Investigations into this can make use of exact calculations of correlation functions. The Dn and Rn can be expressed as Toeplitz determinants, and this method was used in [38, 39] to calculate these correlation functions for n up to 6 and to present exact expressions for n up to 5. Exact calculations of some other C(m,n) were given in [41]. It was shown in [38] that Dn is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n in the complete elliptic integrals K(k) and E(k), where k = k> for T \u2265 Tc and k = k< for T \u2264 Tc. The general structure of Rn for the model of Eqs. (1.1), (1.2) was determined in [39] and is substantially more complicated, as will be reviewed below. As shown in [46], the C(m,n) for this model can be efficiently calculated recursively using certain quadratic relations [31] together with some initial inputs. Both of these methods yield specific correlation functions, e.g., R6, R7, etc. for higher n. In searching for a nonlnear ODE for Rn analogous to the Jimbo-Miwa ODE for Dn, it would be convenient to use inputs that are general functions of n, rather than having to recursively compute Rn for successive fixed values of n. For this purpose, high-temperature and low-temperature series expansions can be useful, if one knows general-n expressions for the coefficients. However, standard procedures for calculating these series expansions are based on enumeration of graphs for a given correlation function C(m,n) and, except for the first or second leading terms, do not normally yield expressions that are general functions of (m,n). Here we focus on Rn. The leading term in the high-temperature series expansion of Rn is v n, and an elementary graphical enumeration yields the first higher-order term as n(n+1)vn+2, but we are not aware of general-n expressions for still higher-order terms in the literature. Similar comments apply for the low-temperature series expansion of this correlation function.\nIn this paper we shall discuss an approach that can yield general-n coefficients of higherorder terms in high-temperature and low-temperature expansions of the row correlation functions Rn for the two-dimensional Ising model defined by Eqs. (1.1)-(1.2) on the square\nlattice. Our procedure makes use of exact calculations of individual Rn. We illustrate the approach by computing general-n coefficients of several higher-order terms in high-temperature expansions of Rn and low-temperature expansions of (Rn)conn.. In addition to their intrinsic interest, this method and these results should be useful in the continuing endeavor to find a nonlinear ordinary differential equation for Rn analogous to the one derived for Dn by Jimbo and Miwa in [29]. Our work here is complementary to studies of form factor expansions for Ising correlation functions (e.g., [28, 50\u201352, 55, 56]). It is also complementary to studies of properties of the Ising model susceptibility \u03c7 (e.g., [26, 44, 45, 47, 54, 56]), since the latter involves a sum over all connected spin-spin correlation functions, not just Rn, via the relation \u03b2\u22121\u03c7 = \u2211\n~r C(~r)conn..\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II we review the general structural form for Rn obtained in [39]. In Sections III and IV we use the exactly calculated Rn from [39] to infer general-n expressions for several coefficients of higher-order terms in high-temperature series for Rn and low-temperatures series for (Rn)conn.. Our conclusions are given in Section V. Some related results are included in appendices."

(2.1)-(2.3), Bn is a numerical prefactor; pn is an integer power 1 and we define the compact notation\nK\u0304(k) \u2261 (k \u2212 1)K(k) . (2.4)\nThe first five Bn were given in [39], viz., B1 = B2 = B3 = 1, B4 = 1/(3 2), and B5 = 1/(3 4) [39]. The sixth is B6 = 1/(3 6 \u00b7 52). The values of the power pn in Eqs. (2.1)-(2.3) were listed (denoted as qn) for n up to 5 in [39]. Here we observe that for the known pn with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 6, the values are consistent with the general formula\npn = [n2\n4\n]\nfloor , (2.5)\nwhere for \u03bd \u2208 R, [\u03bd]floor is the greatest integer \u2264 \u03bd. These powers pn are the same as the powers that occur in the general structural form for the diagonal correlation function Dn that we found in [38]. In the remainder of the paper we will sometimes suppress the subscripts \u00b1 in the notation, with it being understood implicitly that Rn \u2261 Rn,+ for T \u2265 Tc and Rn \u2261 Rn,\u2212 for T \u2264 Tc. Note that although K(k) is logarithmically divergent as k \u0580 1, this divergence is removed by the prefactor (k \u2212 1) in K\u0304(k). Indeed,\nlim k\u21921 K\u0304(k) = 0 , (2.6)\nalthough the derivative (d/dk)K\u0304(k) is logarithmically divergent as k \u2192 1. For a given n, the terms in Rn can be divided into sets such that all of the terms in each set are homogeneous polynomials in E(k) and K\u0304(k) of a given degree. We label this degree as the \u201clevel\u201d of the set. For Rn,\u00b1 with odd n, as is evident from Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3), these terms are explicitly of the form E(k)\u2113\u2212sK\u0304(k)s with \u2113 in the range 0 \u2264 \u2113 \u2264 n and, for a given \u2113, with s in the range 0 \u2264 s \u2264 \u2113, where k = k> for T \u2265 Tc and k = k< for T \u2264 Tc. The corresponding coefficients R(n)\u2113\u2212s,s in Rn,\u00b1 are polynomials in the respective k elliptic modulus variables. For even n, only even-degree levels occur, running over 2\u2113 = 0, 2, ..., n, as is evident in Eq. (2.1). Another difference between the Rn with even and odd n is that for odd n, the same coefficient polynomial R(n)\u2113\u2212s,s(k) occurs for T \u2265 Tc and T \u2264 Tc with the respective assignments k = k> and k = k<, whereas for even n, the R(n,+)2\u2113\u2212s,s(k>) and R(n,\u2212)2\u2113\u2212s,s(k<) are different functions of their respective arguments, k> and k<. A third\n1 The quantities Bn and pn and the dummy index s were denoted Dn, qn, and r in [39]; here we relabel\nthese to avoid confusion with our notation Dn for C(n, n) and r = |~r|.\ndifference between the Rn for even and odd n is that the Rn for odd n contain a squareroot prefactor, (1 + k\u22121> ) 1/2 = (1 + k<) 1/2, whereas the Rn for even n do not contain such square-root prefactors 2.\nThe general structural form that we inferred for Rn is considerably more complicated than the form that we had found in [38] for Dn. These have different expressions Dn,+ and Dn,\u2212 for T > Tc and T < Tc (which are equal at T = Tc):\nDn,\u00b1 = An\u03c0 \u2212n k\u22122pn\u2212[1\u2212(\u22121)\nn]\u0398(T\u2212Tc)/2\nn \u2211\ns=0\nP(n,\u00b1)n\u2212s,s(k) (k2\u22121)\u03b4s,1\u0398(Tc\u2212T )E(k)n\u2212s [(k2\u22121)K(k)]s ,\n(2.7)\nwhere again k = k> if T \u2265 Tc and k = k< if T \u2264 Tc; and \u0398(x) is the Heaviside step function, defined as \u0398(x) = 1 if x > 0 and \u0398(x) = 0 if x \u2264 0. One of the most striking differences is that Dn is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n in E(k) and K(k), while Rn has the multi-\u201clevel\u201d structure of Eqs. (2.1), (2.2), and (2.3). Furthermore, calculations for Dn and the structural form presented in [38] apply for the general anisotropic case J1 6= J2, with k> = k \u22121 < = sinh(2K1) sinh(2K2) and Ki = \u03b2Ji, whereas in the anisotropic case, other correlation functions such as Rn would involve not just complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds, but also those of the third kind, as was already evident for R1 [6, 58]. Our methods could be applied to this case in future work, although the series expansions would depend on two variables, e.g., vi = tanhKi where Ki = \u03b2Ji, i = 1, 2, or equivalently, si = sinh(2Ki) with i = 1, 2 for the high-temperature expansions, and similarly on 1/si with i = 1, 2 for the low-temperature expansions.\nIII.

This is analogous to the calculation of general-n coefficients in the HT expansion of Dn in [37] (see Appendix A), with the crucial difference that for Dn we were able to make use of the fact that the Dn can be determined in terms of solutions of the Painleve\u0301 VI ODE [29], whereas here no analogous (nonlinear) ODE for Rn is known. Hence, we make use of the Rn calculated in [39].\n2 We note some misprints in [4], [38], and [39]. In Eq. (A19) of [4], the expression \u2212 12\u03b32[Fm1,m2 +Fm1,m2\u22121] should read \u2212 12\u03b32[Fm1,m2+1 + Fm1,m2\u22121]. In [38] there was a misprint in the overall sign of P (5,\u2212) 2,3 , which\nshould be reversed. In [39], the coefficient R(4,\u2212)3,1 should be multipled by (k< \u2212 1).\nThe standard procedure for calculating the high-temperature Taylor series expansion for Rn = \u3008\u03c30,0\u03c3n,0\u3009 enumerates the contributions from paths on the bonds of the lattice of minimal length and progressively greater lengths joining the points (0, 0) and (n, 0) (e.g., [5]). The number of bonds in the path is then the power of v in a given term in the series expansion, and the coefficient of each term is a positive integer. If one factors out an overall factor of vn in the small-v expansion of Rn, the rest of the series is a series in powers of v 2. This is an elementary consequence of the fact that if one reverses the sign of the spin-spin coupling J , and hence the sign of K and of v = tanhK, then Rn \u2192 (\u22121)nRn. The lowestorder term, vn, in the small-v series expansion of Rn, arises from the unique graph consisting of a straight path from (0, 0) to (n, 0), of length n. Thus, the high-temperature expansion for Rn has the general form\nRn = v n [ 1 + \u221e \u2211\nj=1\nrn,2j v 2j ] , (3.1)\nwhere the rn,2j are positive integers. Aside from the leading v n term, the paths contributing to all higher-order terms include bonds above the direct, horizontal path, and corresponding paths that are related to these by reflection about the horizontal axis. That is, for each path including bonds above the direct route along the horizontal axis joining the sites (0, 0) to (n, 0), there is a path that is obtained by this reflection process. Therefore, the rn,2j are even integers.\nTo begin, we discuss the graphical derivation of the first subleading term in Eq. (3.1), namely, rn,2v n+2. This term arises from paths of length n+2 bonds connecting the sites (0, 0) and (n, 0). An elementary enumeration counts these paths. The sites (0, \u2113) with 0 \u2264 \u2113 \u2264 n comprise n+1 vertices on the square lattice. One set of paths of length n+2 connecting (0, 0) and (n, 0) involves a 90\u25e6 turn upwards at one of these n+ 1 sites followed by a continuation along horizontal bonds, and then a 90\u25e6 turn downward and final continuation to the point (n, 0). For each such path, there is also a corresponding path obtained by reflecting about the horizontal axis, so that the first right-hand turn is downward instead of upward. There are (\nn+1 2\n) paths in the first set, and hence 2 ( n+1 2 ) = n(n + 1) paths of length n + 2 joining\nthe points (0, 0) and (n, 0). This simple combinatoric argument yields the coefficient, rn,2, of the vn+2 term in the high-temperature expansion of Rn, namely\nrn,2 = n(n + 1) . (3.2)\nThis is manifestly even, since either n or n+ 1 is even.\nNow from high-temperature series expansions of our calculations of Rn for n, we determine the following general-n expression for the next-to-next-leading-order coefficient, rn,4. For reference, we list these expansions for n up to 6 in Appendix B. Our method is motivated\nby the structural form as polynomials in n that we obtained for coefficients of higher-order terms in the HT series for Dn in [37] (reviewed in Appendix A). We thus fit the respective O(vn+4) terms in the HT series expansions of the exact expressions for Rn to a polynomial. This is an overconstrained fit, and we obtain the result\nrn,4 = n\n4 (n3 + 2n2 + 3n+ 10) . (3.3)\nAlthough there is an extensive literature on series expansions of quantities in the twodimensional Ising model, we are not aware of this expression for rn,4 having appeared in this literature. An alternate approach to determining rn,4 would make use of an enumeration of all graphs that contribute to the O(vn+4) term in the high-temperature expansion of Rn for arbitrarily great n. This result is given to illustrate the method; clearly, one could proceed to calculate coefficients of more higher-order terms, rn,6, etc. Since the rn,2j with 2j \u2265 6 are higher-degree polynomials in n, the procedure for calculating these polynomials via overconstrained fits requires the input of a larger number of row correlation functions. However, as emphasized, the value of this method is that the resultant coefficient applies for general n and hence is directly applicable to the search for a nonlinear differential equation whose solution would yield Rn.\nDespite the prefactor of 1/4, it is easy to show that the expression for rn,4 in Eq. (3.3) is an integer, and, furthermore, is even. This is proved by induction, starting from any of the known rn,4 values for 1 \u2264 n \u2264 6, each of which is even. Given that there exists an n such that rn,4 is even, to carry out the inductive proof, one must prove that rn+1,4 is also even. This can be done by showing that the difference, rn+1,4 \u2212 rn,4, is even, i.e., rn+1,4 \u2212 rn,4 = 2p for some (positive) integer p. We calculate\nrn+1,4 \u2212 rn,4 = (n+ 2)(n2 + n + 2) . (3.4)\nSince the factor (n+ 2) can be even or odd, we thus need to show that n2 + n+ 2 is always even. This follows directly by observing that n2 + n + 2 = n(n + 1) + 2. Now n(n + 1) is manifestly even, since either n or n + 1 is even, and hence n(n + 1) + 2 is even. This completes the proof that the expression for rn,4 in Eq. (3.3) is an even (positive) integer.\nOne can also express these results equivalently as series expansions in powers of the variable \u221a k>, using the relation (B2). It is convenient to introduce the variable k\u0302> = (1/4)k> as in Eq. (B4). Then Eq. (3.1) can be written as\nRn = k\u0302 n/2 >\n[\n1 +\n\u221e \u2211\n\u2113=1\nr\u0303n,\u2113 k\u0302 \u2113 >\n]\n, (3.5)\nwhere\nr\u0303n,1 = n 2 (3.6)\nand\nr\u0303n,2 = 1\n4 n(n\u2212 1)(n2 \u2212 n\u2212 8) . (3.7)\nWhile the coefficients rn,2, rn,4, and r\u0303n,1 are positive and monotonically increasing as functions of n in the interval n \u2265 1, the behavior of r\u0303n,2 is more complicated. As a function of n, with n generalized from integral values to real values in this interval n \u2265 1, r\u0303n,2 decreases from zero at n = 1 through negative values, reaching a minimum of \u22124 at n = (1/2)(1 +\u221a 17) = 2.56155 and then increases monotonically for larger n, passing through zero again at n = (1/2)(1 + \u221a 33) = 3.37228. Thus, r\u0303n,2 is negative for n = 2 and n = 3, taking the values r\u03032,2 = r\u03033,2 = \u22123.\nIV. GENERAL-n COEFFICIENTS OF HIGHER-ORDER TERMS IN THE\nLOW-TEMPERATURE SERIES EXPANSION OF (Rn)conn.\nIn addition to its intrinsic interest, the spin-spin correlation function C(~r) is important\nbecause its limit as r \u2192 \u221e determines the (square of the) spontaneous magnetization:\nlim r\u2192\u221e\nC(~r) = M2 , (4.1)\nwhere r \u2261 |~r|. The connected correlation function is then\nC(~r)conn. \u2261 C(~r)\u2212M2 . (4.2)\nFor T < Tc where the spontaneous magnetization is nonzero, an interesting question concerns the approach to the limit (4.1), For a given ~r, a quantitative measure of this approach is provided by the ratio\nAC(~r) = C(~r)\nM2 = 1 + C(~r)conn. M2 , (4.3)\nIn this section, we present our results on general-n coefficients of higher-order terms in the low-temperature Taylor series expansions of (Rn)conn. = Rn\u2212M2 and ARn = Rn/M2. In calculating (Rn)conn, we make use of the result first published by Yang [2] for the spontaneous magnetization in the two-dimensional Ising model on the square lattice,\nM = (1\u2212 k2<)1/8 = (1 + u)1/4(1\u2212 6u+ u2)1/8\n(1\u2212 u)1/2 . (4.4)\nThe quantity M2 has the resultant low-temperature Taylor series expansion\nM2 = 1\u2212 4u2 \u2212 16u3 \u2212 64u4 \u2212 272u5 \u2212 1228u6 \u2212 5792u7 \u2212 28192u8 \u2212 140448u9\n\u2212 712276u10 \u2212 3663664u11 \u2212 O(u12) . (4.5)\nThe property (4.1), together with the property that M and Rn are continuous functions of u, implies that as n increases, the low-temperature (i.e., small-u) Taylor series expansion of Rn must coincide with the small-u expansion of M 2 to an increasingly high order, and the order of the first term in the small-u expansion of Rn \u2212 M2 must go to infinity as n \u2192 \u221e. From general arguments, for an Ising ferromagnet on (the thermodynamic limit of) a given lattice, Rn is a monotonically decreasing function of n for fixed temperature T , i.e., Rn \u2265 Rn+1, and hence Rn \u2265 M2. (The two points at which this inequality is realized as an equality are (i) T = 0 for any n, where Rn = M\n2 = 1, and (ii) T = \u221e, where for n \u2265 1, Rn = M 2 = 0.)\nThe low-temperature Taylor series expansions of the Rn in powers of u or k< match the corresponding expansions of M2 to O(un+1) = O(kn+1< ) inclusive. Thus, the LT series expansion of Rn has the general form\n(Rn)conn. = 4u n+2\n[\n1 +\n\u221e \u2211\nj=1\n\u03c1n,ju j ] = 4k\u0302n+2< [ 1 +\n\u221e \u2211\nj=1\n\u03c1\u0303n,jk\u0302 j <\n]\n. (4.6)\nHere it is convenient to use the rescaled variable k\u0302< = (1/4)k< (as defined in Eq. (B4)), since this yields integral coefficients \u03c1\u0303n,j . Using LT expansions of the Rn that we have calculated exactly, we apply the same polynomial fitting procedure that we used for the HT expansions. For reference, we list these LT expansions in Appendix C. We obtain the following general-n expressions for the un+3 and un+4 terms in Eq. (4.6):\n\u03c1n,1 = n 2 + 2n+ 4 , (4.7)\nand\n\u03c1n,2 = 1\n2 (n4 + 4n3 + 13n2 + 26n+ 32) . (4.8)\nEquivalently, for the expansion of (Rn)conn. in terms of k\u0302< in Eq. (4.6), we have\n\u03c1\u0303n,1 = n 2 (4.9)\nand\n\u03c1\u0303n,2 = 1\n2 (n + 2)(n3 \u2212 2n2 + n + 6) . (4.10)\nBy combining the LT expansion for M2 with these results, one can thus obtain the corresponding general-n LT expansion for Rn up to O(u n+4) = O(k\u0302n+4< ). We are not aware\nof the expressions (4.7)-(4.10) having appeared before in the literature. These results are given to illustrate the method and could be extended to higher order using additional Rn correlation functions as input.\nNote that, despite the prefactor of 1/2, the expression for \u03c1n,2 is an integer. We give an inductive proof of this. First, this integral property holds for the LT series for R1. Hence, it is necessary and sufficient to show that with \u03c1n,2 being integral, so is \u03c1n+1,2. To do this, we show that the difference \u03c1n+1,2 \u2212 \u03c1n,2 is integral. This difference is\n\u03c1n+1,2 \u2212 \u03c1n,2 = (n+ 1)(2n2 + 5n + 11) , (4.11)\nwhich is obviously integral. The same inductive method shows that \u03c1\u0303n,2 is an integer.\nCombining these results with the definition ARn = Rn/M 2 yields\nARn = 1 + 4u n+2\n[\n1 + \u03c1n,1u+ (\u03c1n,2 + 4)u 2 +O(u3)\n]\n= 1 + 4un+2 [ 1 + (n2 + 2n+ 4)u+ 1\n2 (n4 + 4n3 + 13n2 + 26n+ 40)u2 +O(u3)\n]\n.\n(4.12)\nEquivalently, in terms of the k\u0302< variable,\nARn = 1 + 4k\u0302 n+2 <\n[\n1 + \u03c1\u0303n,1k\u0302< + (\u03c1\u0303n,2 + 4)k\u0302 2 < +O(k\u0302 3 <) ]\n= 1 + 4k\u0302n+2<\n[ 1 + n2k\u0302< + 1\n2 (n4 \u2212 3n2 + 8n+ 20)k\u03022< +O(k\u03023<)\n]\n.\n(4.13)"

It is also complementary to another method that was used in [37] for the high-temperature expansions of diagonal correlation functions Dn, which was based on the property that the\nDn can be computed in terms of solutions to the Painleve\u0301 VI ordinary differential equation of [29]. In addition to the intrinsic interest in the general-n coefficients discussed here, they provide further inputs to the continuing quest to find a nonlinear ordinary differential equation whose solution would determine the Rn."

Essam for an informative communication. This research was supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation Grant NSF-PHY-1915093.\nAppendix A: General-n Coefficients in the High-Temperature Series Expansion of Dn\nThe high-temperature series expansion of Dn in the Ising model on the square lattice has\nthe form\nDn =\n\u221e \u2211\nj=n\nc (D) n,j x j , (A1)\nwhere x \u2261 v2 (c.f. Eq. (1.6)) and the subscript + in Dn,+ is understood implicitly. An elementary combinatoric argument determines the coefficient of the leading-order term as\nc(D)n,n = (2n)!\n(n!)2 . (A2)\nThe series (A1) can equivalently be written as\nDn = c (D) n,n x\nn [\n1 +\n\u221e \u2211\n\u2113=1\nr (D) n,\u2113 x\n\u2113 ]\n, (A3)\nwhere the ratio r (D) n,j is given by\nr (D) n,\u2113 =\nc (D) n,n+\u2113\nc (D) n,n\n. (A4)\nLet us define a variable t as t = k\u22122> for T \u2265 Tc and t = k\u22122< for T \u2264 Tc, and auxiliary functions \u03c3n,\u00b1 as follows:\n\u03c3n,+ = t(t\u2212 1) d lnDn,+ dt \u2212 t 4 (A5)\nand\n\u03c3n,\u2212 = t(t\u2212 1) d lnDn,\u2212 dt \u2212 1 4 . (A6)\nIn [29], Jimbo and Miwa showed that the \u03c3n functions are solutions to the following ordinary differential equation of Painleve\u0301 VI type (where subscripts \u00b1 on \u03c3n are understood implicitly for T \u2265 Tc and T \u2264 Tc and \u03c3\u2032n \u2261 d\u03c3n/dt):\n[t(t\u2212 1)\u03c3\u2032\u2032n]2 \u2212 n2[(t\u2212 1)\u03c3\u2032n \u2212 \u03c3n]2 + 4\u03c3\u2032n [ (t\u2212 1)\u03c3\u2032n \u2212 \u03c3n \u2212 1\n4\n]\n(t\u03c3\u2032n \u2212 \u03c3n) = 0 . (A7)\nThe diagonal correlation functions Dn,\u00b1 are then determined in terms of the \u03c3n,\u00b1. In [37] with Ghosh, using the result from [29], we derived the general form of the nine terms beyond the leading term in the high-temperature expansion of Dn = Dn,+. (In [37], the coefficients c (D) n,j and the ratios r (D) n,\u2113 were denoted as cn,j and rn,n+j, respectively.) Our results in [37] included the following for the ratios r (D) n,ell, in our present notation:\nr (D) n,1 = 2n (A8)\nr (D) n,2 =\nn(2n2 + 3n+ 5)\nn+ 1 (A9)\nr (D) n,3 =\n2n(2n3 + 5n2 + 16n+ 25)\n3(n + 1) (A10)\nr (D) n,4 = 4n6 + 24n5 + 103n4 + 372n3 + 943n2 + 726n\u2212 48 6(n+ 1)(n+ 2)\n(A11)\nr (D) n,5 = 4n7 + 32n6 + 183n5 + 930n4 + 4031n3 + 10228n2 + 6972n\u2212 960 15(n+ 1)(n+ 2) , (A12)\nand so forth for higher-order terms up to r (D) n,9 . It is interesting to note that, in an analogous manner, it was possible to use the fact that correlation functions for the transverse Ising quantum spin chain at critical field and T = 0 satisfy a Painleve\u0301 V equation to derive a number of properties of the correlation functions for these functions [33]-[36],[42, 43]."
