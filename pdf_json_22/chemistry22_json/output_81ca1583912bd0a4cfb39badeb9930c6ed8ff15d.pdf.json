    "abstractText": "The rapid development of biogas plants in China has generated large quantities of digestate. The disparity between the continuity of biogas plant operation and the seasonality of digestate utilization has led to the need to store digestate. Therefore, untargeted profiling of bioactive compounds in the digestate stored under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was performed. The antioxidant and antifungal activity of digestate stored under varying conditions was likewise assessed. The results delineated that digestate storage under varying conditions brought about the degradation of organic acids, alkenes, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, ethers, amino acids and their derivatives, and esters, leading to the stabilization of digestate components. Together, these new data revealed that digestate storage for up to 20 days under aerobic conditions promotes glycine, serine, and threonine degradation pathways and enhances biotin and vitamins production. In contrast, anaerobic storage enhances the taurine and hypotaurine metabolic pathways and increases the derivation of antimicrobial substances, such as indole alkaloids. Moreover, digestate storage under anaerobic conditions promotes antioxidant and antifungal activity more than storage under aerobic conditions. These findings can contribute to the future development of high-value agricultural products from digestate and the sustainability of biogas plants. Further studies are required for the untargeted metabolomic of digestate under storage to explore the underlying mechanisms of promoting disease resistance by the digestate upon land application.",

            "text": "In recent decades, the demand for animal-derived food has risen dramatically due to continuing population growth and a shift in diet toward meat consumption [1]. Increased protein-based food consumption has resulted in rapid, intensive livestock farming industrialization [2]. This quick industrialization of animal husbandry has prompted the generation of huge amounts of animal manure, posing a serious threat to the soil and water\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4923. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084923 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nenvironment [3,4]. The anaerobic digestion (AD) process and its mild operating conditions of complex organic carbon distinguish it from conventional energy technologies, making it a highly appealing and sustainable green energy technology for manure treatment, producing methane-rich biogas and nutrient-rich digestate [5,6]. Since it is high in readily available macro- and micronutrients, anaerobic digestate is a beneficial soil amendment [7]. Despite its well-known agronomic benefits, the use of digestate as an organic fertilizer or soil amendment in farmlands is dependent on plant and crop seasonality. Besides this, the oversupply and improper distribution of digestate, especially in the regions of intensive biogas plants and its application at an inappropriate time, enhance air and water pollution [8\u201310]. Consequently, before favorable agronomic applications in adjacent or remote farmlands, digestate had to be stored onsite for a certain period (up to 10 months) [11]. However, the storage and transport of digestate would bring about gaseous emissions and nutrient leaching, resulting in various environmental concerns, such as global warming and eutrophication [12,13]. Digestate is usually stored in open and closed reservoirs after solid\u2013liquid separation. Digestate storage in open tanks leads to various problems, such as gaseous and odor emissions, the production of toxic compounds, and pathogen regrowth, thus limiting its potential fertilizing value [14]. Few studies have already been conducted for evaluating gaseous emission, antibiotics, and heavy metals removal from digestate during storage. For example, Vergote et al. [15] observed that nitrous oxide and methane emissions increased with digestate storage volume and temperature increase. In contrast, Mehta et al. [16] concluded that around 76% of doxycycline was removed with the storage of digestate under anaerobic conditions. Similarly, Li et al. (2018) reported an increase in organic matter, nutrients, and heavy metals during the storage of digestate openly under mesophilic conditions [17]. Studies on variations in the contents and type of bioactive compounds in the digestate during storage are scarce. Under anaerobic conditions, the degradation of organic compounds results in recalcitrant fractions, like biopolymers, steroids, and lignin [18]. Bioactive compounds, such as fatty acid derivatives, alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids generated during the digestion of organic matter, are responsible for the disease resistance property of the digestate [19,20]. Thus, profiling bioactive compounds in the digestate during storage is necessary for evaluating antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and the underlying mechanism of promoting disease resistance by the digestate upon land application. Therefore, to address this knowledge gap, the current study was undertaken for untargeted metabolomics profiling and the meta-analysis of biochemical changes that occur during digestate storage at different temperatures (4 \u25e6C, 20 \u25e6C, and 30 \u25e6C) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions based on the cloud-based mass spectrometric data analysis software (XCMS) integrated with the MetaboAnalyst program. Furthermore, the contents and type of bioactive compounds in the digestate preserved under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were compared. The antifungal and antioxidant activity of the digestate under varying storage conditions was also evaluated."

Sample Preparation for GC\u2013MS\nThe digestate (20 mL) from each storage mode was blended with an equal amount of extractant (dichloromethane: methanol = 3:1) in a covered test tube. After that, 10 g of sodium chloride was added, and the mixture was agitated on an oscillator for one hour. An ultrasonic instrument was used to assist with the extraction process (KH300SP, 25 kHz, 300 W, Kunshan Ultrasonic Instruments Co., Ltd., Kunshan, China). The samples were first centrifuged for 30 min at 4032\u00d7 g. After that, the supernatant layer was collected, and the rest was discarded. The extract obtained from the previous test was evaporated to 1.5 mL using a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Laborota 4001, Schwabach, Germany) at 40 \u25e6C and under a vacuum at 96 kPa.\n2.5.2. GC\u2013MS Analysis\nDigestate extract analysis was conducted using a GC\u2013MS (Agilent 7890/5975, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness) and a quadrupole analyzer, operated in electron impact (70 eV) mode, with an m/z ranging from 35 to 600. The column was programmed so that the temperature increased at a rate of 5 \u25e6C min\u22121, from 60 \u25e6C to 180 \u25e6C; then, the rate was increased to 10 \u25e6C min\u22121 until the column reached 280 \u25e6C. The temperature was then maintained at 280 \u25e6C for 10 min. About 1.5 \u00b5L of the extract was then injected into the GC\u2013MS using a micro-syringe, and scanning was performed for 50 min. After separation and detection, the compounds were eluted from the column and identified by comparing their mass spectra using the NIST08 data library [23].\n2.5.3. Data Processing and Statistical Analysis\nThe raw GC\u2013MS data were uploaded to the XCMS online program for peak identification, peak filtering, and peak alignment to obtain a data matrix including the nucleus to mass ratio and retention time and peak area. The processed data were subjected to a multivariate statistical analysis using SIMCA-P (version 14.1; Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). An unsupervised multivariate pattern recognition method, namely a principal component analysis (PCA), was performed to examine the intrinsic variation in the data set. The supervised projection of orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)) was performed for class discrimination. The quality of the OPLS-DA model was then assessed using 200 permutation tests. Variables were selected based on their effect on projection (VIP), reflecting the correlation between different storage conditions and the digestate composition. To confirm the metabolic substances significant for digestate under varying storage conditions, all ions were sorted in descending order according to their VIP values. Potential metabolic markers were selected based on VIP values >1 and critical p-values from t-tests. The effect of aerobic or anaerobic storage on the most critical metabolites in the digestate was evaluated under varying storage temperatures, with a similarity index (SI) of >70% for the variables.\n2.5.4. Pathway Analysis\nTo discover the differential metabolites that significantly changed in the experimental groups, a pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0, a web-based metabolomics data analysis software. An enrichment analysis was performed based on\nthe Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database among these differential metabolites. Pathways with impact values > 0 and \u2013log (p) > 2 (p < 0.01) were considered to be the most significant derivative pathways for the generation of metabolites."

XCMS-generated cloud plots allow an effective representation of GC\u2013MS-based metabolomics data by providing information including the p-value, the directional fold change, the retention time, and the mass-to-charge ratio of metabolic features within a defined threshold [24,25]. The calibration procedure used for visualization and quality control, including an overlay of all chromatograms acquired before and after Rt. calibration, is shown in Figures S1 and S2. Based on the above pre-processing, around 1014 statistically significant features (p \u2264 0.05 *) were exported from the raw GC\u2013MS data (Supplementary Materials). Moreover, the Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) biplot provides a more straightforward visualization of authenticated samples, representing dissimilarities as a function of distance (Figure S3). In addition, unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) models were constructed on datasets after preliminary processing to get the intuitive metabolic distribution in the digestate under different storage modes (Figure 1). The PCA scores of PC1 and PC2 from the variable\u2019s covariance matrix were 46% + 13%. The depicted clusters of samples in the same group proved the accuracy of the analytical methodology. A certain degree of separation was observed between the digestate samples from different storage modes. This proved that the differences between samples and sample sets were generated by actual biological differences, rather than instrumental effects. In addition, there was a clear separation among the digestate at different storage temperatures and durations. Moreover, with increased storage time, the location of samples in the PCA score plot moved slowly from left to right, indicating a gradual change in the composition of the digestate. Furthermore, the storage temperature strongly affected the distribution of plots. The effect of storage temperature on the composition of the digestate was explicitly shown by the slow movement of the samples from the bottom to the top of the PCA scoring plot. However, when the storage temperature was \u226520 \u25e6C, the samples aggregated as a cluster after a storage duration of >40 days, especially at 80 days. Therefore, within 40 days of storage, the metabolite spectrum of digestate was significantly affected by the storage temperature. The composition of the digestate tended to be consistent after 80 days of storage. In addition, the PCA plot showed a separation in the metabolite distribution patterns of the digestate stored under anaerobic and aerobic conditions at 20 \u25e6C, which illustrates that air conditions affected the chemical composition of digestate at 20 \u25e6C under the first 40 days of storage. The chemical compositions of digestate under storage at 4 \u25e6C for more than 40 days were independent of the stored oxygen content."

Significant metabolites, including volatile short-chain organic acids (2-chloro-propanoic acid, 2-Hydroxyethanesulfonate, b-Mercaptolactic acid, Carbonate, Fumaric acid, Glyoxylic acid, and \u03b2-Hydroxypyruvic acid), alkenes (Ethylene sulfide and Vinylidene fluoride), aldehydes (4-Chlorobenzaldehyde), alcohols (2-Furanmethanethiol, Dimercaprol, DL-Dithiothreitol, and R-3 (Methylthio)-1-hexanol), ketones (Dihydro-3(2H)-thiophenone, Pterosin H), ethers (Dimethyldisulfide, and Propanethial S-oxide), amino acids and their derivatives (6-Chloro3- hydroxypyridazine, 6-Thioxanthine, Castanospermine, and hydroxyurea, N-(2-phenoxyethyl)), and esters (Arachidonoylmorpholine, 11-dimethyl-Ellipticine, Ethyl syringate, isoflurophate, and m-Chlorobenzamide Thien-2-ylacetate) were observed in digestate stored at 4 \u25e6C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Figure 2a). When comparing aerobic and anaerobic storage conditions, the metabolites tanospermine, Methional diethyl acetyl, and Nor-nitrogen mustard were observed in digestate stored at 4 \u25e6C under aerobic conditions, while functional metabolites including 3-Hydroxypyridine and Latanoprost were observed in digestate stored under anaerobic conditions at 4 \u25e6C. In contrast, D-threonic acid, Lys Lys Arg, Nor-nitrogen mustard, and Vinylidene fluoride and 2,3-diphenyl-2-propenoic acid, Castanospermine, Cystanospermine, Cysteamine, 2- Hydroxyethanesulfonate, 4-Chlorophenylacetic acid, and N-Acetyltranylcypromine were observed for digestate stored at 20 \u25e6C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively (Figure 2b). Conversely, metabolites 3-Hydroxypyridine and Arachidonoylmorpholine were found in the digestate stored at 30 \u25e6C under aerobic conditions, and Castanospermine, 2,3-diphenyl-2-propenoic acid, 5-Methyl-2-thiophene carboxaldehyde, Benzydamine, Bis (chloromethyl) ether, and Glyoxylic acid were observed for digestate stored at the formerly mentioned temperature under anaerobic conditions (Figure 2c).\nFurthermore, it was observed that the rate of degradation increased with incremented digestate storage duration, and the maximum degradation of components, including some organic acids, alkenes, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, ethers, amino acids and their derivatives, and esters, occurred after 80 days of storage, resulting in the stabilization of the digestate composition. When comparing significant metabolites detected after 80 days of digestate storage at different temperatures, similar metabolites were observed for digestate storage at 4 \u25e6C and 30 \u25e6C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions; however, the metabolites 2,3-diphenyl-2-propenoic acid, Castanospermine, Taurine, Cysteamine, Tryptamine Cysteamine, 2-Hydroxyethanesulfonate, 4-Chlorophenylacetic acid, aand Acetyltranylcypromine were detected in the digestate stored at 20 \u25e6C under anaerobic conditions, while D-threonic acid, Hydroxy-pyruvate, Glyoxylate, Biotin, Uera, Lys Lys Arg, Nor-nitrogen mustard, and Vinylidene fluoride were detected in the digestate stored under aerobic conditions at the former temperature. These findings were consistent with the PCA analysis results, which represented a more significant contribution of oxygen content to the composition of the digestate at 20 \u25e6C storage."

As shown in Tables 2 and 3, 40 and 49 derivative pathways were observed for the digestate stored at 20 \u25e6C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Based on the analysis of p-values and impact values, the nine most significant metabolic pathways enriched in the digestate stored at 20 \u25e6C under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were selected (Figure 3). The specific metabolite derivative pathways in the digestate at 20 \u25e6C under aerobic conditions included steroid hormone biosynthesis; purine metabolism; cysteine and methionine metabolism; biotin metabolism; galactose metabolism; pyruvate metabolism; purine metabolism; glyoxylate metabolism; and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. In contrast, cyanoamino acid metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; tryptophan biosynthesis; cysteine and methionine metabolism; tyrosine metabolism; glutathione metabolism; cyanoamino acid metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; and methane metabolism were found to be responsible for metabolite generation in the digestate stored under anaerobic conditions at the formerly mentioned temperature.\nSome of the metabolic pathways in the digestate were disturbed by different storage modes, leading to an impact on the active components therein, for example, a decrease in the metabolism of vitamin substances and an increase in the purine substance-derived pathway under aerobic storage conditions. An increase in indole acetic acid production by tryptophan metabolism occurred mainly in anaerobic storage.\n3.3.1. Aerobic Storage of Digestate Promotes the Biotin Metabolic Pathway for Vitamin Production\nBiotin is a water-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties derived from the breakdown of volatile fatty acids, promoting plant root growth [27]. Biotin was detected in digestate stored under aerobic conditions (Figure 4c). Biotin metabolism starts with fatty acids biosynthesis and then methylates to form pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester and PimeloylACP. The products are then converted to biotin following a biotin bicyclic assembly step (Figure 5a). Biotin is catabolized by beta-oxidation of the valeric acid side chain or oxidation of sulfur in the heterocyclic ring [28]. At the same time, an inverse relationship was observed between storage temperature and biotin in aerobic storage. Therefore, the biotin metabolism in the digestate is boosted in aerobic storage, and the antioxidant properties of the digestate reduce with an incremented temperature and storage duration.\n3.3.2. The Aerobic Storage Mode Promoted Glycine, Serine, and Threonine Metabolism to Enhance the Antimicrobial Capacity\nDigestate storage under aerobic conditions promoted the metabolism of glycine, serine, threonine, and purine metabolism. The transamination reaction between serine and glycine to form hydroxyl pyruvate and glycine is catalyzed by glyoxylate aminotransferase and requires oxygen\u2019s involvement (Figure 4b). As the temperature increased, glyoxylate gradually increased with the transamination reaction between serine and glyoxylate. Glyoxylate has a significant antimicrobial ability and is a target product for developing many antimicrobial agents [29]. In addition, under the aerobic storage of digestate, the purine metabolic pathway was enhanced with further conversion to urea, explaining the reduced antioxidant properties under high-temperature aerobic storage conditions.\n3.3.3. Anaerobic Storage Enhances the Tryptophan and Lysine Metabolic Pathway to Produce Indole Alkaloids\nThe metabolism of tryptophan and lysine during anaerobic storage of the digestate resulted in the production of castanospermine and tryptamine (Figure 4e,f). It means the anaerobic environment facilitated the conversion of these readily catabolized amino acids to indole alkaloids. Moreover, the relative abundance of castanospermine and tryptamine gradually increased with an increasing temperature. The highest relative levels of castanospermine and tryptamine were observed at 20 \u25e6C and after 20 days of storage, with a relative abundance of 19,886\u00b1 4986 and 24,975\u00b1 1654, respectively, indicating an enhanced tryptophan metabolism. Castanospermine and Tryptamine are indolizidine alkaloids that\nhave been identified in several synthetic antimicrobial agents as well as natural antibacterial ingredients. Castanospermine has been identified as having antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumour effects [30]. Tryptamine has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects [31,32].\n3.3.4. Anaerobic Storage Promotes the Taurine and Hypotaurine Metabolism Pathways to Produce Antioxidants\nTaurine and hypotaurine metabolism pathways were detected in the digestate stored under anaerobic conditions, with the maximum relative abundance observed at 20 \u25e6C storage (Figures 4h and 5b). Taurine in digestate is derived from cysteamine. The anaerobic condition activates anaerobic genes and promotes the production of oxygen-sensing enzymes, such as cysteamine oxygenase. These oxygen-sensing enzymes can control anoxia-dependent processes. For example, oxygen-sensing enzymes act on mutations of amino acids in their active sites, catalyze oxygen-dependent oxidation, and drive the addition of two oxygen atoms to free cysteamine to form taurine. They can also act on individual donors by incorporating molecular oxygen (oxygenase) to form taurine. Taurine can scavenge free radicals and attenuate lipid peroxidation; therefore, it can be used as an antioxidant to stabilize biofilms and applied in agriculture to enhance nutrient uptake by plants [33,34]."

            "text": "To identify the effect of different storage modes on the antioxidant properties, digestate\u2019s ability of digestate under varying storage conditions to scavenge DPPH radicals was determined (Figure 6). The antioxidant capacity of the digestate in both aerobic and anaerobic storage modes first increased in short-term storage (0\u201340 days) and then decreased with long-term storage (40\u201380 days). The maximum antioxidant capacity of digestate stored at 4 \u25e6C, 20 \u25e6C, and 30 \u25e6C under aerobic conditions was obtained up to 10 day\u2019s storage and was approximately 65.03 \u00b1 9.27, 76.00 \u00b1 7.30, and 69.01 \u00b1 8.20 \u00b5mol/L Trolox, respectively. The highest antioxidant capacity of the digestate stored at 4 \u25e6C, 20 \u25e6C, and 30 \u25e6C under anaerobic conditions was around 77.23 \u00b1 7.04, 82.15 \u00b1 9.5, and 73.27 \u00b1 0.20 \u00b5mol/L Trolox, respectively. In comparison, the minimum antioxidant activity (<50 \u00b5mol/L Trolox) was obtained after 60 days of storage under different modes.\nThe maximum antifungal activity of digestate against Fusarium oxysporum was observed for digestate stored at 20 \u25e6C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (83.3 \u00b1 7.37% and 89.8 \u00b1 5.13%, respectively) (Figure 6b). Conversely, the antifungal activity was minimum for the digestate stored at 4 \u25e6C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (76.7 \u00b1 4.04% and 78.9 \u00b1 3.37%, respectively). Moreover, it was perceived that the antifungal activity decreased with an increase in storage duration. For low-temperature storage at 4 \u25e6C, the digestate could be stored for up to 40 days, regardless of oxygen content. Storage at 20 \u25e6C\nin an anaerobic state contributed to the best antioxidant and antifungal properties of the digestate. Storage of digestate at 30 \u25e6C for merely 10 days resulted in a significant reduction in antimicrobial activity. The short storage duration of the digestate helped to maintain the relative stability of the digestate, probably due to the conversion of proteins, amino acids, and sugars and fats into secondary derivatives in the digestate. The increased antioxidant and antifungal activity in the digestate stored under anaerobic conditions was because of the accumulation of indolizidine alkaloids from ricin and tryptamine. The accumulation of cysteamine and taurine in the digestate stored under anaerobic conditions further promoted antioxidant and antifungal activity (Figures 4 and 5). Conversely, the accumulation of glyoxylic acid in the digestate stored under aerobic conditions was responsible for the antioxidant activity of the digestate (Figures 4 and 5). Contrasted with the current study, Ramli et al. (2021) evaluated extracts from a Durio zibethinus peel and seed for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity [35]. They reported that the extract from peels contained higher contents of total phenolics and flavonoids than the seed. They further observed that both the peel and seed exhibited antioxidant activity."

            "text": "Untargeted metabolomics profiling in digestate stored at varying temperatures (4 \u25e6C, 20 \u25e6C, and 30 \u25e6C) and time (0 to 80 days) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was performed. The antioxidant and antifungal activity of digestate stored under varying conditions was also evaluated. The results showed that the degradation rate increased with an increase in storage duration. The maximum number of metabolites was detected after 80 days of storage, irrespective of the temperature and mode (aerobic and anaerobic). Moreover, around 49 metabolic pathways of metabolite generation were observed for digestate stored under anaerobic conditions, while 40 metabolic pathways were detected in digestate stored under aerobic conditions. The maximum antioxidant and antifungal activity (82.15 \u00b1 9.5 \u00b5mol/L Trolox and 89.81 \u00b1 5.13%, respectively) were recorded for digestate stored at 20 \u25e6C for 20 days under aerobic conditions. This study also showed that metabolomics can be an innovative and promising approach to elucidate the derivation pathways of metabolites and provide new perspectives for a further analysis of digestate under varying storage conditions. More studies are needed for exploring untargeted metabolomic profiling and the antifungal activity of digestate under varying storage conditions to evaluate its disease resistance potential upon land application.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijerph19084923/s1, Figure S1: The calibration procedure used for visualization and quality control, including an overlay of all total ion chromatograms acquired before Rt.
