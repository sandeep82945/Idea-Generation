1. **Investigate the use of different deep learning architectures for apple scab detection.** The YOLOv5 network used in this study is just one of many deep learning architectures that can be used for object detection. Other architectures, such as Faster R-CNN or SSD, may be better suited for detecting apple scab.
2. **Explore the use of different spectral bands for apple scab detection.** The eight spectral bands used in this study were selected based on their ability to discriminate between healthy and scabbed leaves. However, other spectral bands may be more effective for detecting apple scab.
3. **Collect a larger dataset of apple scab images.** The dataset used in this study was relatively small, which may have limited the accuracy of the deep learning model. Collecting a larger dataset of apple scab images would allow for more robust training of the model and potentially improve its accuracy.
4. **Investigate the use of data augmentation techniques to improve the accuracy of the deep learning model.** Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, and rotation, can be used to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the generalization of the deep learning model.
5. **Explore the use of deep learning for other plant disease detection tasks.** The methods developed in this study could be applied to the detection of other plant diseases, such as powdery mildew, rust, and leaf spot. This could help to develop new tools for early detection and management of plant diseases.
