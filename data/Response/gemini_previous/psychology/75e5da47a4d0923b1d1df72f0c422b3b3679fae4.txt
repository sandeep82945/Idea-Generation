1. **Investigate the role of protein environment in the photochemical reaction of rhodopsins.** How does the protein environment affect the rate, quantum yield, and selectivity of the photoreaction? What are the key amino acid residues that interact with the chromophore and how do these interactions affect the photochemical properties of the protein?
2. **Compare the photochemical properties of different types of rhodopsins.** How do the photochemical properties of type I and type II rhodopsins differ? What are the structural and functional differences between these two types of rhodopsins that give rise to these differences in photochemical properties?
3. **Explore the potential applications of rhodopsins in optogenetics and other fields.** Can rhodopsins be used to control the activity of neurons or other cells with light? Can they be used to develop new types of sensors or imaging agents?
4. **Investigate the evolution of rhodopsins.** How did rhodopsins evolve from their ancestral proteins? What are the key evolutionary changes that have occurred in rhodopsins over time? How have these changes affected the function and properties of rhodopsins?
5. **Develop new methods for studying the photochemical properties of rhodopsins.** Can new experimental or computational methods be used to study the photochemical properties of rhodopsins in more detail? Can these methods be used to gain new insights into the mechanism of the photochemical reaction and the role of protein environment in this reaction?
