1. **Investigate the impact of socioeconomic factors on vaccine hesitancy and refusal.** This could be done through qualitative studies to understand the underlying reasons for vaccine hesitancy and refusal, and quantitative studies to examine the association between socioeconomic factors and vaccine uptake.


2. **Examine the role of social networks and community engagement in promoting vaccination.** This could involve studying the influence of social networks on vaccination decisions, and exploring the effectiveness of community-based interventions in increasing vaccination rates.


3. **Assess the effectiveness of different strategies for addressing vaccine inequality.** This could include evaluating the impact of financial incentives, targeted outreach programs, and mobile vaccination clinics on vaccination rates among underserved populations.


4. **Develop and evaluate interventions to improve the equitable distribution of vaccines.** This could involve working with governments and international organizations to develop policies and programs that ensure that vaccines are distributed fairly and equitably to all populations.


5. **Conduct longitudinal studies to track the long-term impact of socioeconomic factors on vaccination rates.** This could help to identify trends and patterns in vaccination uptake over time, and inform the development of policies and interventions to address persistent disparities.
