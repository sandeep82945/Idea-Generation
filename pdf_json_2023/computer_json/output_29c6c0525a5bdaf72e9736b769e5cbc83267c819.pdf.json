Two typical problems of this kind are computationalaided material design and drug discovery, in which quantum chemistry plays a critical role in answering questions such as \u223cWhich one is the best?\u223c. Many recent efforts have been devoted to the development of advanced quantum algorithms for solving quantum chemistry problems on noisy intermediatescale quantum (NISQ) devices,2,4\u201314 while implementing these algorithms for complex problems is limited by available qubit counts, coherence time and gate delity. Specically, without error correction, quantum simulations of quantum chemistry are viable only if low-depth quantum algorithms are implemented to suppress the total error rate. Recent advances in error mitigation techniques enable us to model manyelectron problems with a dozen qubits and tens of circuit depths on NISQ devices,9 while such circuit sizes and depths are still a long way from practical applications.\nScience and Technology of China, Hefei n; jlyang@ustc.edu.cn l Sciences at the Microscale, University of 026, China ture, Institute of Computing Technology,\n, China.

To model these systems, the Schr\u00f6dinger equations are much too complicated to be solvable. It therefore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics be developed.20 One popular scheme is to divide the complex problem under consideration into as many parts as possible until these become simple enough for an adequate solution, namely the philosophy of DC.21 The DC method is particularly suitable for NISQ devices since the subproblem for each part can in principle be solved with fewer computational resources.15\u201318,22\u201325 One successful application of DC is to estimate the ground-state potential energy surface of a ring containing 10 hydrogen atoms using the density matrix embedding theory (DMET) on a trapped-ion quantum computer, in which a 20-qubit problem is decomposed into ten 2-qubit problems.18\nDC oen treats all subsystems at the same computational level and estimates physical observables by summing up the corresponding quantities of subsystems, while in practical simulations of complex systems, the particle\u2013particle interactions may exhibit completely different characteristics in and between subsystems. Long-range Coulomb interactions can be well approximated as quasiclassical electrostatic interactions since empirical methods, such as empirical force led (EFF)\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

As the distance between particles decreases, the repulsive exchange interactions from electrons having the same spin become important so that quantum mean-eld approaches, such as Hartree\u2013Fock (HF), are necessary to characterize these electronic interactions. Furthermore, van der Waals interactions, such as hydrogen bond and stacked p\u2013p bond interactions and (near-)degenerate electronic interactions should be evaluated using more accurate wave function methods.27,28 Therefore, aer decomposing a complex system into many subsystems, treating interactions in and between them with different computational models according to the characteristics of these interactions is an optimal way to approximate the exact results with moderate computational cost. This strategy is oen referred to as multiscale modeling that aims at solving problems at multiple scales of space and/or time.29\u201331\nOne of the most widely used multiscale models is the combination of classical and quantum mechanical (QM) principles for theoretical simulations of large biological molecules and condensedmatter systems. Here, QMmodels are computationally demanding due to the high computational complexity of QM methods. In particular, when the QMmodels using the high-level wave function theory (WFT) are employed to describe the central part of a complex system, the size of the\nFig. 1 Schematic structure of multiscale quantum computing.

Due to the potential computational power of quantum computing, QM models using quantum algorithms are a feasible way to overcome the compromise between accuracy and size. In this work, we refer to this strategy that integrates quantum computing into multiscale models as multiscale quantum computing (see a typical example in Fig. 1). Quantum algorithms are expected to provide an exact solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in polynomial time,10,11 which enables us to enlarge the size of the QM region without loss of efficiency.\nAnalogous to classical multiscale modeling, one is able to employ molecular mechanical (MM) approaches, semiempirical approaches or even quantum mean-eld approaches, such as HF or density functional theory (DFT), to describe the environment and the interaction between the molecule and environment. The correlation energy should in principle be fully accounted for using quantum computing models when fault-tolerant quantum computers are available. In the NISQ era, the major challenge of multiscale quantum computing is analogous to that of classical multiscale modeling, that is, how to use limited quantum resources to approximate the exact results. In this work, we divide the QM region into fragments and build the QM model using energy-based fragmentation approaches.32 Furthermore, in each fragment, one can decompose the correlation effect into dynamic and static\ntein\u2013ligand complex is divided into two parts, including amolecule and r mechanical principles, respectively; (2) the molecule is further divided ments are described by the wave function theory and Hartree\u2013Fock divided into active and frozen spaces, which correspond to static and nian in the active space are computed on quantum computers; (5) the\nChem.

Thus, this scheme is able to extend applications of quantum simulations to complex systems.\nIn Section 2, we present a detailed introduction to a general framework of multiscale quantum computing for complex system simulations, including typical computational models, DC strategies and correlation energy decomposition schemes. In Section 3, we propose a practical scheme for implementing multiscale quantum computing in quantum chemistry. We focus on modeling the QM part with high accuracy on NISQ devices since its combination with low-level computational methods for modeling other surrounding parts has been extensively studied.29\u201331 To adapt our algorithm to contemporary quantum resources, we rst employ the many-body expansion (MBE) fragmentation approach to partition the QM part of a system into small fragments. The accuracy of the MBE approach can be systematically improved toward the accurate results by including high-order many-body corrections. In each fragment, the quantum algorithm is employed to exactly solve complete active space (CAS) problems to describe the static correlation energy. The perturbation theory is applied to recover the dynamic correlation energy that is also essential in accurately characterizing energy proles. In comparison with the DMET33 that was recently introduced in quantum computing, applying perturbation theories, such as secondorder M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), in the MBE approach is straightforward. As pilot applications, our methods are used to model systems consisting of hundreds of orbitals with decent accuracy. This demonstrates that our method would be particularly applicable to near-term quantum devices."

In multiscale modeling, one uses a variety of models at different levels of resolution and complexity to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency.\nA popular multiscale scheme to deal with complex systems at the electronic scale is to combine QM models with MM models.30 The total energy of a QM/MM system can be written as\nEtotal = EQM + EMM + EQM\u2013MM (1)\nwith EQM\u2013MM being the interaction energy between the QM and MM regions. Here, the DFT is a favorable approach to describe the electronic exchange and correlation effect and the EFF is a common MM model to describe the environment. This strategy is able to provide a qualitative description of the chemical reaction in the enzyme active site and then interpret the catalytic power of enzymes.34 While, limited by the power of classical computers, it is computationally prohibitive to\n3192 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3190\u20133205\nestimate the total energies with chemical accuracy since the exact solution to quantum mechanical problems is exponentially complicated. As such, when applying the QM/MM method to material and drug design, it is impossible to realise an exact screening due to numerical errors. The appearance of quantum computers provides a potential solution for accurate simulations of material properties or system behavior.\nWhen commercial quantum computers become a reality, it is expected that quantum resources will be sufficient to implement the QM model straightforwardly within the framework of quantum computing. In the case of NISQ devices, it is necessary to further decompose the QM problem into subproblems that are treated at different levels, leaving the most time-consuming sub-problem to quantum computing. Fig. 1 shows a schematic structure of multiscale quantum computing using a protein\u2013ligand system as an example. This complex system is rst divided into a molecule and a molecular environment as is commonly performed in the QM/MM scheme. The environment can be represented by a variety of low-scaling computational models, ranging from EFFs to semiempirical wave function approaches, or even to DFT. The central region should include the ligand molecule and surrounding segments of the protein, leading to a QM system containing tens or even hundreds of atoms. We further divide this QM system into many fragments, with intra-fragment interactions described by the WFT and high-order inter-fragment interactions described by the HF theory. Finally, the orbital space is divided into an active space and a frozen space. In the active space, the CAS conguration interaction (CI) problem is diagonalized on a quantum computer. Aer this three-step DC procedure, the CASCI problem is usually simple enough to implement on NISQ devices with low-depth quantum circuits."

Inspired by the deep insight into electron\u2013electron interactions from quantum chemistry, QM-based potential models with no empirical parameters, e.g. effective fragment potential (EFP), have been developed for a more accurate description of the environment.35 The interaction energy of the EFP model includes electrostatics, polarization, dispersion and exchange-repulsion contributions, while, both the EFF and EFP models contribute a local embedding potential to the Hamiltonian of the QM part. In the EFF model, the coupling between the QM region and the environment is approximated with an electrostatic potential. In the EFP model, an additional polarization potential is included.

Alternatively, it is possible to construct a more accurate embedding potential from QM methods. Frozendensity embedding theory (FDET) constructs an exact embedding potential through a constrained optimization of the total electron density.36 Given that the FDET embedding potential has the formof a universal functional of charge densities, the formalism is in principle rigorous if the functional is exact. In practical simulations, charge densities can be determined from a non-self-consistent-eld optimization or even from individual calculations of fragments to save the computational cost. The embedding potential can also be constructed from wave functionbased approaches. The X-Pol method is such a theory in which the embedding potential is formulated based on the wave function of other surrounding fragments.37"

DFT can in principle yield the exact ground-state energy and electron density of a quantum system, as evidenced by its increasingly broad application in chemistry and materials science for predicting and interpreting complex system behaviors at an atomic scale. The accuracy of the DFT approach depends on exchange-correlation functionals while the exact form of functionals is unknown. Therefore, approximate exchange correlation functionals are adopted in practical calculations. Due to its low computational complexity, DFT has been extended to very large-scale simulations of systems containing millions of atoms.38 As a consequence, DFT is able to provide a qualitative description of most quantum chemistry problems.\nWhen accuracy in the laboratory, oen referring to chemical accuracy (within 1 kcal mol\u22121), is required, WFT approaches are an appealing option since their accuracy can be systematically improved toward the full conguration interaction (FCI).

Its circuit depth scales as quartic as the system size. In addition, the UCCSD ansatz is unable to describe the strong correlation effect, such as the triple bond dissociation of molecular nitrogen.43 Many recent studies have contributed to the development of adaptive VQE algorithms to reduce circuit depth.44\u201348 Adaptive derivativeassembled pseudo-trotter (ADAPT) ansatz44 builds a very compact representation of electronic wave functions while maintaining high accuracy.

A variety of fragment-based approaches, such as the fragment molecular-orbital method,50 the molecular fragmentation with conjugated caps method,51,52 and the (generalized) many-body expansion,53\u201355 have been proposed for studying complex systems. The accuracy of fragment-based approaches depends onmolecular fragmentation schemes and posteriori corrections to high-order many-body interactions.32 In contrast, quantum embedding theories provide a more exible way to partition large systems. The interaction between the subsystem and the environment is described by including bath orbitals in subsystem calculations. However, applying posteriori corrections to the DMET is not a trivial task since it involves a self-consistent iteration procedure. A pilot implementation of the DMET within the framework of the VQE has been recently realized for a ring of 10 hydrogen atoms on a trapped-ion quantum computer.18 A numerical simulation of C18 with the cc-pVDZ basis (up to 144 qubits) has been performed with the DMET-VQE method.19 Although these preliminary studies have demonstrated the advantage of the DC strategy in quantum computing, the application of theDC approaches within the VQE framework to practical quantum chemistry problems is still an open question."

Therefore, the main task of quantum computing is to accurately recover the correlation energy, which can be further decomposed into dynamic and static correlation energies (Table 2). This decomposition is oen performed according to the partition of the orbital space, including core, active and virtual spaces. The static correlation should be accounted for in the active space model. The exact solution to this problem is related to a CAS(N, M) problem, namely distributing N active electrons in the M active spin orbitals in all possible ways. Considering that the computational complexity increases exponentially as a function of N, quantum computing is anticipated to be a natural choice for solving this problem. Aer the static correlation is obtained, the dynamic correlation can be recovered by classical posteriori corrections.58 This procedure is oen referred to as \u223cstatic-then-dynamic\u223c, which has been widely used in the WFT, e.g. CASPT2 (rst CASSCF and then applying second-order perturbation theory). This procedure has also been adopted in quantum computing for improving the accuracy of calculations beyond the minimal basis set.

And then the diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian is simplied to a CAS problem within a small active space.

The environmental effects are not taken into account since it is a trivial task to include the electrostatic potential in the Hamiltonian when the EFF is used. The reference ground-state wavefunction is computed with the HF method. The molecular systems are divided into multiple fragments. The total molecular properties are recovered using the many body expansion theory. Adaptive VQE algorithms that iteratively build a compact wave function ansatz44 are employed to nd an exact solution of the ground state within the active space of fragments. For simplicity, this specic algorithm is referred to as MBE-VQE. The MP2 correction to the VQE algorithm is used to account for the dynamic correlation energy. In the following, we give a brief introduction to the theoretical methods integrated into the MBE-VQE algorithm. In Section 4, we apply MBE-VQE to study the relative energies of the hydrogen chain, the C18 ring and water hexamers.

The hydrogen chain is an extremely simple model while it is essential for understanding diverse fundamental physical phenomena, such as insulator-to-metal transition and the antiferromagnetic Mott phase.85 Here, the hydrogen chain is divided into ve fragments and each fragment contains 2 hydrogen atoms. Two kinds of MBE-VQE methods, including MBE2-VQE and MBE3-VQE, have been employed to describe high-order corrections. In MBE2-VQE, dimers consisting of 4 hydrogen atoms are used to obtain second-order corrections. Analogously, trimers consisting of 6 hydrogen atoms in MBE3VQE are used to compute third-order corrections. In the DMET-VQE simulations, each fragment that contains two hydrogen atoms is considered an embedded system, and the remaining eight hydrogen atoms are considered the environment. The bath orbitals are constructed from orbitals localized at environmental hydrogen atoms. As such, two impurity orbitals and two bath orbitals are used to build the embedding Hamiltonian.

In the following calculations, we can demonstrate that the MBE-VQE method can be applied to covalent systems and gives a quite reliable description of systems that have strong intrafragment interactions but weak interfragment interactions. In addition, it is well known that the MBE method is not an appropriate method for describing delocalized correlated systems. The MBE-VQE calculations of the cyclo[18]carbon system also show the same conclusion.\nWe apply the MBE-VQE method to study relative energies of the cyclo[18]carbon ring. A series of cyclo[18]carbon structures are generated by xing the diameter of the ring to 7.31 \u00c5 while changing q and BLA. Fig. 4 shows the relative energies (dened as the energy difference with the lowest point) as a function of the q or BLA. The cc-pVDZ basis-set is utilized in all of the calculations. Considering the existence of triple bonds in cyclo [n]carbon molecules, an appropriate way to set fragments is to take two carbon atoms as one fragment. Such a fragment breaks the original single bond between fragments, so hydrogen link atoms should be added. In this situation, a monomer in the MBE calculation is an ethyne molecule, two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms form a total of 38 MOs. A dimer is either a butadiyne molecule or two ethyne molecules, with 66 or 76 MOs. For monomers, the ve orbitals (two occupied and three virtual) closest to the Fermi level are chosen to be the active space for VQE calculation. For dimers, nine orbitals (three occupied and six virtual) form the active space. The MP2 correction to the VQE is used for describing the correlation effect resulting from orbitals not included in the active space.

In each fragment, four valence orbitals (2s orbital and three 2p orbitals) are treated as impurity orbitals. The rest orbitals in that fragment are treated at the Hartree\u2013Fock level. Four bath orbitals are constructed with orbitals from environmental carbon atoms.\nFig. 4 shows that MBE-VQE agrees very well with CCSD when q is small and BLA is large. As BLA approaches 0, the deviations resulting from MBE keep getting larger. This is because when BLA gets smaller, the bond structure exhibits a transition from an alternating single bond and triple bond to uniform double bonds. In this case, breaking the double bonds inevitably introduces large numerical errors in MBE and DMET methods. In addition, it is also improper to add a hydrogen atom as the link atom, because the bonds we serve cannot be treated as a single bond anymore. Instead of the link atom approach, ghost orbitals introduced in the FMO method92 may be a more appropriate choice to saturate the carbon atoms. However, the introduction of the FMO method cannot x the problem of severing delocalized orbitals in the case of a small BLA. In addition, cyclo[18]carbon is a very special case in which we cannot avoid severing double bonds since it has a ring structure. In most cases, we can always choose an appropriate fragmentation scheme to avoid breaking important chemical bonds, especially when we have enough computational resources. It is also worth mentioning that CCSD may not be accurate enough to study cyclo[18]carbon when all C\u2013C bond lengths are almost equivalent. In such a conformation, there are many degenerate orbitals so that the correlation effect becomes very strong. Table 3 shows the energy deviation of the MBE-VQE method and DMET-VQE method with respect to the CCSD method. The values of BLA at the most stable conformation are estimated to be 0.11 and 0.10 \u00c5 with the MBE-VQE and DMETVQE methods, respectively. When the value of BLA is larger or close to that of the equilibrium geometry, the MBE-VQEmethod yields an excellent agreement with the CCSD method. While, as the value of BLA decreases, the MBE-VQE method deteriorates\nvery quickly since the fragmentation method is not suitable for partitioning these strong correlation problems."

As the smallest piece of ice, the structure of water hexamers, namely the cluster composed of six water molecules, has attracted much attention93\u201396 because it helps us understand the behavior of water. It is interesting to apply multiscale quantum algorithms to study the properties of water hexamers.\nFig. 5 shows eight of the most stable water hexamer structures determined in ref. 94. An annealing strategy is used to nd a series of stable conformations at the MP2/6-311++g** level. The most stable structure is estimated to be the prism one. The total energies of these structures are calculated with the MBE-VQE method. The DMET-VQE method is also used as a comparison. In water hexamers, each water molecule is specied as a fragment. The cc-pVDZ basis set is employed. In the MBE-VQEmethod, a monomer contains one water molecule with 24 molecular orbitals and a dimer has two water molecules with 48 molecular orbitals. To achieve the best accuracy with tolerable computing resources, we choose a small active space for VQE calculations. For monomers, two occupied MOs with the lowest energy are treated as frozen orbitals, and the following four MOs are chosen as the active space to construct the effective Hamiltonian; for dimers, four MOs with the lowest energy are frozen and the following eight MOs form the active space. So in the MBE-VQE calculations, active spaces containing up to 16 qubits are used. Due to the small active space used in the VQE, the neglect of other orbitals is corrected by including a MP2 correction using eqn (23).\nFig. 6 shows the relative energies of eight different structures of water hexamers. Both the MBE-VQE and DMET-VQEmethods give a correct prediction of the most stable water hexamer,\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3190\u20133205 | 3199\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

As such, relative energies are dened with respect to the energy of the prism water hexamer. For DMET-VQE, the relative energy of the cyclic structure is signicantly underestimated with respect to the CCSD results, in which the energy of the cyclic structure is much higher than those of the book, cage and prism-book structures. In addition, all relative energies of other seven hexamers predicted by DMET-VQE with respect to the prism hexamer are systematically higher than the corresponding ones predicted by CCSD. As shown in Table 4, the average error of the DMET-VQE method is as large as 5.91 millihartree. As discussed in ref. 84, the accuracy of the DMET method can be improved by increasing the size of fragments, but this also results in higher computational cost. An alternative scheme to improve the DMET results is to perform posterior corrections aer the DMET calculations. The DMET energy is automatically adjusted by iteratively relaxing one-particle orbitals in fragments, accompanied by a change in the global particle number and chemical potential. Therefore, formulating posterior corrections beyond the active space using the perturbation theory is very involved, requiring a comprehensive consideration of the choice of bath orbitals, the construction of one-particle orbitals and the fragment Hamiltonian. In the MBE-VQE method, we describe the correlation energy missing in the active space calculations by adding MP2 corrections. The MBE-VQE results shown in Table 4 reveal that such corrections are able to accurately restore the relative energies of eight water hexamers, with an average error of 0.58 millihartree, with respect to those from CCSD."

            "text": "As one viable scheme for implementing multiscale quantum computing, the MBE-VQE algorithm combined with low-level computational methods, such as EFFs, provides an appealing tool to study complex systems on near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, we can extend the simulation scale by introducing\n3200 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3190\u20133205\nthe implicit solvation model, which accounts for the solvent or other environmental effects.97 In this work, we only apply the MBE-VQE algorithm to study the energy proles of molecular systems containing hundreds of orbitals, while extending this algorithm to large molecular systems is straightforward, without increasing the size and depth of quantum circuits. In addition, it is easier to realize high scalability of quantum computing chips using industrial chip fabrication techniques than to improve the delity and coherence time of quantum gates.98 Fortunately, the MBE-VQE algorithm is inherently suitable for embarrassing parallelization since each fragment calculation is independent. And its computational complexity scales as N2 if the many-body expansion is truncated to the second order. Therefore, it is possible to realize large-scale MBE-VQE simulations of complex systems with distributed quantum devices.\nIn energy-based fragmentation approaches, the total energy is assembled from the energies of subsystems. If the electronic structure of a subsystem is signicantly different from the corresponding one in the whole system, it may result in large errors in the total energy. Therefore, we should avoid breaking bonds that leads to a remarkable change in electronic environments, such as delocalized chemical bonds and bonds involved in strongly correlated interactions, when dening fragments in the MBE-VQE algorithm. As a result, the MBE-VQE algorithm may make it difficult to describe transition metal coordination compounds or organometallic compounds because breaking metal\u2013ligand covalent bonds makes it unlikely to maintain an accurate estimate of the energy. However, apart from this limitation, namely including these bonds in one fragment, the MBE-VQE algorithm is still expected to work for these systems. In addition, the MBE-VQE algorithm may make it difficult to describe nonlocal electronic excitations and magnetic systems, such as frustrated spin systems.\nIt is worth mentioning that the numerical results presented in this work are evaluated using a quantum simulator. The implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy quantum devices is quite challenging due to error accumulation. For the MBE-VQE method, the total energy is obtained by collecting many energy terms of monomers, dimers, trimers,. Therefore, in the worst case, the total error will be NtermsdE. Here, Nterms is the number of the energy terms and dE is the largest error in the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

On the other hand, when a quantum simulation of the full system is conducted on noisy quantum devices, the quantum circuit required to achieve a high accuracy will be much more complicated than those for subsystems. As the size and depth of quantum circuits increase, error accumulation due to noise will become more serious. Therefore, further studies are necessary to assess the performance of the MBE-VQE method on noisy quantum devices. In addition, in the long term, the error from the MBEVQE method may become important if the error from noise in a small-scale quantum simulation can be remarkably suppressed.\nIt is well known that MBE methods suffer from the basis-set superposition error (BSSE), which originates from the fact that molecular properties calculated using the basis set of a single molecular fragment differ from those calculated using the basis set of the entire molecule. The impact of BSSE becomes more signicant when diffuse basis functions are used.99,100 This is because diffuse functions centered on one fragment are more likely to have a remarkable overlap with the basis functions centered on its neighbouring fragments. Previous studies suggested several methods to avoid or minimize the BSSE effect in the MBE method.99,100 One simple strategy is to use a large basis set without diffuse functions. Another effective method is the counterpoise (CP) method,101,102 in which the energies of subsystems are calculated with the entire molecule's basis functions. In order to improve the results of the MBE-VQE calculations, it is necessary to include the BSSE effect in future studies."

            "text": "In this work, we introduce a general framework for multiscale quantum computing and demonstrate its practical implementation using a MBE-VQE algorithm. The MBE-VQE algorithm can be easily implemented within the VQE framework without extensive modication to existing quantum algorithms. The MBE fragmentation approach is more suitable for describing the strongly correlated intra-fragment interactions, leaving the weak inter-fragment interactions to high-order many-body corrections. This implies that in principle multiple chemical bonds should not be severed in fragmentation. The calculations for monomers, dimers, trimers, ., in the MBE fragmentation approach are highly independent so the MBE-VQE approach is embarrassingly parallelizable if a large number of quantum processors are available. In addition, the MBE-VQE approach can be easily combined with posterior correction methods to restore the long-range interactions when the many-body expansion is truncated at a low order.\nThe MBE-VQE algorithm has been applied to study the cyclo [18]carbon molecule and water hexamers. It gives a good description of the relative energies of these two systems with respect to the CCSD method. For the cyclo[18]carbon molecule, the equivalent bond length predicted by the MBE-VQE\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nalgorithm agrees well with the experimental results. For water hexamers, the MBE-VQE algorithm gives a good estimation of the relative stability of different congurations. The methods are expected to nd promising applications in elds such as biochemistry, catalysis or other complicated chemical reactions. As discussed in Section 2, the combination of computational methods at different levels of resolution is diverse in the sense that exploring multiscale quantum computing is still an open problem in the NISQ era.\nMost chemical reactions happen in complex environments, such as solution or proteins. Therefore, in order to apply quantum computers to design new catalysts or develop new drugs, we must consider the environmental effect in order to obtain reliable results. Classical multiscale simulation methods have been developed for many decades. In such a framework, the active region is oen treated with quantum mechanical methods. While, limited by the computing power of classical computers, mean-eld methods, such as density functional theory, or coupled cluster methods are oen used to describe the electronic structure of active regions. The multiscale quantum computing framework proposed in this work can utilize quantum algorithms that can provide quantum advantage when fault-tolerant quantum computers become a reality such that it will be superior to classical multiscale simulation methods in the future. As such, the multiscale quantum computing framework provides a viable strategy for applying quantum computers to complicated material and biological molecular simulations."

Eqn (29)\u2013(31) represent an interaction bath formulation of the DMET. In contrast, the noninteracting bath formulation of the embedding Hamiltonian includes only two-electron integrals on the subsystem orbitals and mimics other Coulomb interactions with a correlation potential.84\nIf the wave function of the full system is known a priori, the bath orbitals and the embedding Hamiltonian are well dened. However, due to the high computational complexity of obtaining an exact wave function of the full system, an approximate wave function from the low-level electronic structure calculation, such as HF, is used to construct the bath orbitals. These bath orbitals can be self-consistently improved by solving the embedded problems with a high-level quantum mechanical method. Given the wave function approximation introduced in the DMET, the embedding density matrix for the subsystem SA may differ from the exact one.
