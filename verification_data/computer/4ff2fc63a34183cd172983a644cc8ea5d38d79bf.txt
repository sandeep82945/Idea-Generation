"**8 conclusion and future work** There is an emerging concern of using agile practices in GSD projects to get the mutual benefits of both distributive and agile methods. Scrum, as an agile most known methodology, is currently admired by many development teams. It is typically considered productive for small-scale projects with co-located teams because scrum teams are self-organized and enabled on excellent team collaboration and communication. However, GSD are usually distributed by distance differences, which results in numerous challenges or risks that might affect team collaboration and communication processes. For sustainable development and implementation of distributed Scrum in GSD, there is a need to identify and mitigate all the confronted challenges in distributed Scrum. This study identifies challenges associated with distributed scrum development by analyzing past studies and validated by practitioners through a survey. A framework is proposed to mitigate the challenges validated by practitioners, and expert review is conducted by interviewing five distributed scrum experts to validate the proposed framework. The focus of this study was the identification of distributed scrum challenges and the proposal of a framework to mitigate the identified challenges for sustainable distributed development."
