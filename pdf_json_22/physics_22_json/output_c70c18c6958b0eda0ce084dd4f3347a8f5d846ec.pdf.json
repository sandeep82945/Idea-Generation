    "abstractText": "There has been considerable recent interest in type II string compactifications on AdS3\u00d7S\u00d7M4 due to both new progress in the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence and an independent search for new N = (4, 0) supergravity solutions. In this work we report a new family of small N = (4, 0) preserving warped AdS3\u00d7S\u00d7CY2 compactifications of type IIB supergravity. The S3 in this family is non trivially fibered over the CY2. We show how these new solutions provide a IIB embedding of minimal ungauged d = 5 supergravity coupled to an Abelian vector multiplet. We also make a few initial steps towards the identification of dual CFT2 candidates. Specifically, we study the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of the spin two and certain vector fluctuations that are expected to be dual to the stress-energy tensor, SU(2) R current and several other BPS operator families in the dual CFT2.",

            "text": "AdS3 compactifications of strings and supergravity are of great interest for the AdS/CFT correspondence because they are supposed to describe duals of 2d 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories [1]. Strings in AdS3 with NS-NS flux were initially studied in [2\u20135], where a lot of information was obtained, including spectra and correlation functions, but it also became clear that the dual CFTs belong to a special class. In particular, the spectrum of\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nsuch theories must in general contain a continuum of states dual to long strings. It has been suspected for long time that strings in AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7M4 are dual to CFTs on symmetric product orbifolds (M4)N/SN , but which precise AdS3 backgrounds and which precise CFTs are related by the duality has been unclear. Part of the tests of this AdS3/CFT2 correspondence where performed in the strong coupling limit of the putative CFTs, which corresponds to the classical gravity limit of strings. The gravity limit allows one to deduce information about the BPS spectrum, which can be tested in the dual CFTs beyond strong coupling, because BPS states are protected against quantum corrections. For compactifications on AdS3\u00d7S3 preserving N = 4 supersymmetry, either small (N = (4, 0)) or large (N = (4, 4)), the BPS spectrum was studied in the greatest generality in [6, 7]. While in general the spectra showed consistency with the world sheet analysis and with symmetric orbifold CFTs, in particular in the sector with only the Neveu-Schwarz flux turned on [8\u201310], there were a few puzzles. One of them was related to large multiplicity of the BPS spectrum in geometries preserving the large superconformal algebra [7, 11]. This algebra contains a SU(2)\u00d7SU(2) subalgebra whose representations correspond to angular momenta `1 and `2 on the S3 of AdS3\u00d7S3 and on the S3 withinM4. The BPS bound in this algebra is saturated by `1 = `2, but this had not been seen in the analysis [7], which relied on group theory arguments (rather than a direct computation of the spectrum in supergravity) seemingly permitting states with independent `1 and `2. More recently significant progress addressing these problems has been achieved. A detailed analysis of the type IIB supergravity spectrum on AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7S3\u00d7S1 [12], beyond the representation theory arguments of [6] and [7], has demonstrated that the BPS bound `1 = `2 is in fact satisfied at the supergravity level and no infinite degeneracy of the BPS states occur, and no far-fetched quantum correction is necessary to remove redundant states. Moreover it proved possible to demonstrate the precise correspondence between the tensionless limit of strings (k = 1 unit of NS flux) on this background [13], and on AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7T4 [14], and CFTs on the respective symmetric orbifolds. An obvious follow up direction is to search for more examples of exact AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. In this work we turn to warped AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7CY2 compactifications of type IIB string theory that preserve the small N = (4, 0) superconformal algebra. The canonical example of a solution realising this algebra is the D1-D5 near horizon [1], which preserves (4, 4) supersymmetry, so two copies of the small algebra of opposing chiralities. The simplest generalisation of this is the D1-D5+KK near horizon [9, 15\u201317] which replaces S3\u2192 S3/Zk in the above breaking supersymmetry to N = (4, 0). In recent years there has been some renewed effort to construct small N = (4, 0) solutions in type II supergravities [18\u201332], of particular interest to us here is the SU(2)structure classification of [21]: the main focus of this work was to construct local solutions in massive IIA on AdS3\u00d7S2\u00d7CY2, that were later used to construct holographic duals to N = (4, 0) linear quivers [22\u201324]. However [21] also found a pronounced generalization of the D1-D5 near horizon: this is a warped AdS3\u00d7M7 class with S3 \u21aa\u2192 M7\u2192 CY2 and solutions in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of a generalised Laplace equation on CY2 \u2014 it preserves small N = (4, 0). The presence of a non trivial CY2 dependent\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nwarp factor means that one is not constrained to only considering T4 and K3, one can also achieve a bounded M7 with non compact CY2s bounded to some finite sub-region by D5 branes and/or O5 planes. The first example of such a solution was found in [33] namely a solution on AdS3\u00d7S3 \u00d7 R4 bounded between an O5 and D5s but with no fibration turned on. Part of the motivation of this work is to construct more general solutions of this type, with non trivial fibration,1 another is to make some headway into understanding the CFT duals of such solutions. In this work we present new solutions with S3 non trivially fibered over CY2. We consider the case where CY2 = R4 in some detail, constructing solutions bounded between D5 brane and O5 plane singularities, O5-O5 singularities and between an O5 and a regular zero. We also consider the case where CY2 = T4, and derive PDEs defining solutions for which CY2 contains a U(1) isometry but is otherwise completely generic. In addition to constructing new AdS3 vacua, we show that the class in which they reside can be generalised to provide a new type IIB embedding for all solutions of minimal ungauged supergravity in 5 dimensions coupled to an additional Abelian vector multiplet.\nWith a set of new supersymmetric backgrounds in hand, the first step in identifying the dual CFT is identifying the spectrum of strings in such backgrounds. While this turned out to be possible for the unwarped solutions dual to symmetric orbifold CFTs of [12\u201314], this is a hard problem in general. A more modest goal is to determine the spectrum of light operators using the supergravity approximation of string theory, in which case the problem is reduced to finding the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of the respective AdS3 compactification. Even this simpler problem is generally out of reach, so only a handful of examples are known in their full glory, e.g. the result of [34] for AdS3 and [35\u201337] in higher dimensions. New hopes are connected with the method of Kaluza-Klein spectrometry [38, 39], based on the formalism of exceptional field theory. The new methods seem to be rather powerful, extending beyond supersymmetric backgrounds. Some AdS3 spectra for simple solutions have been recently revisited and corrected in [40]. However it is our understanding that such spectrometry methods are only fully developed for AdS3 solutions of d = 6 gauged supergravity at this time, with a full mapping of d = 10 fields to \u201cexceptional geometry\u201d still lacking for AdS3. Even if this were not the case the situation here is complicated by the presence of D brane and O plane sources whose fluctuations need to be taken into account \u2014 this was not yet attempted by the exceptional field theory approach.\nOur take on the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of a new family of (4, 0) solutions in this work is by analysing its most protected species, included in the spin two multiplet,2 that is the spectrum of the stress-energy tensor, R current and associated BPS families. The graviton, or the spin two fluctuation of the metric, is a particularly simple mode as it happens to decouple from fluctuations of other fields and sources. This fact was proven for backgrounds that are warped products containing a maximally symmetric 4-manifolds in [41]. A particular generalisation of that analysis applies here as well. We also show that spin one fluctuation dual to the triplet of R currents of (4, 0) SUSY is a relatively simple\n1Note that [29] has some overlap with this goal, albeit for related IIA solutions without such a fibration. 2Unless explicitly specified the spin of the mode is its spin with respect to the isometry group of AdS3\ndefined as s = |h\u2212 h\u0304|, where h and h\u0304 are the left-moving and right-moving conformal weights.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nmode, although not directly obtained from a fluctuation of a single type IIB field. Both observations are consequences of SUSY that places R current and the stress-energy modes in a single short multiplet. Consequently, the spin one equation can as well be generalized to a generic set of backgrounds, as is the case of the spin two mode. In this work we only discuss the R current mode for the simplest representative of the class of new supergravity solutions, leaving generalizations for another paper [75]. This mode comes from a coupled fluctuations of the metric and the Ramond-Ramond 2-form potential that are bi-vectors with respect to AdS3 and S3. The fact that the R current mode requires perturbations of two supergravity fields, allows us to detect a few additional decoupled spin one modes. Together with the spin two perturbation of the metric along AdS3 directions the spectrum of the above perturbations reveals the expected BPS branches, containing the stress-energy tensor with conformal dimension \u2206 = h+ h\u0304 = 2, the R current \u2206 = 1; the corresponding towers of heavier BPS operators labeled by the S3 spin `1, (\u2206 = `1 + 2, s = |h \u2212 h\u0304| = 2) and (\u2206 = `1, s = 1), which are the highest and the lowest members of the short spin two multiplets; and three additional BPS families of vectors, two with (\u2206 = `1 + 2, s = 1) and one with (\u2206 = `1 + 4, s = 1). The analysis of the spectrum requires an appropriate choice of boundary conditions for the fluctuations along CY2, and in particular in the compact direction transverse to S3. In this work we applied the general set of conditions previously used in the literature, e.g. [42, 43]. Such conditions are justified by the variational principle, which is compatible with either fixing the fluctuations at the boundaries (Dirichlet case) or making them satisfy a canonically conjugate boundary condition (Neumann case). In fact, the conditions used in [42, 43] assume the strong form of Dirichlet boundary conditions (fluctuations vanish), for regular boundary points. The strong form of boundary conditions implies that the eigenvalues of the associated Sturm-Liouville problem are non-negative. We find then that in the considered set of backgrounds only the modes satisfying the Neumann boundary conditions can saturate the BPS bound of the superconformal algebra. We also demonstrate, how the multiplicity of the BPS spectrum, mentioned in the case of AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7S3\u00d7S1, is avoided in the supergravity analysis with the above boundary conditions: BPS states of the superconformal algebra with general values of `2 (spin on S3 within CY2 or S3\u00d7S1) violate the non-negativity of the eigenvalues. We also checked the spectrum of non-BPS states and found two qualitatively different pictures in the O5-O5 and O5-D5 scenarios. In the former case one obtains a bona fide discrete spectrum, asymptotically linear for large values of the respective quantum number. In the latter case, there is only a finite number of eigenstates, that number being a function of the moduli of the background, such as the number N5 of the original D5 branes. The discrete spectrum is bounded from above by a continuum cut, at which the fluctuations become unnormalisable. The cut moves to infinity as one interpolates between the O5-D5 and O5-O5 situations. There are a few important points that one should keep in mind in the discussion of the spectrum. First, D-branes and O-planes act as sources for the bulk supergravity fields. Consequently, when the background fields are perturbed, fluctuation of the sources must be included, or their absence must be justified. In the case of the spin two mode decoupling\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nfrom the sources was checked in [41]. The backgrounds of the present work fit in the general class discussed by that paper. Spin one fluctuations considered here also decouple from the sources. This will be shown in a separate work for a more general class of backgrounds [75]. Second, solutions with D-brane and O-plane sources are often singular, so the supergravity description should break down in the vicinity of such objects, and it is not known in general, how this problem can be addressed. Here we assume that for the fact of the backgrounds being supersymmetric the supergravity results will still be valid after appropriate singularity resolving corrections are taken into account. This must be true as long as the BPS states are considered, and an interesting question is whether the observed pecularities of the non-BPS states in the O5-D5 systems would survive in the full picture as well. This paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we introduce a family of N = (4, 0) AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7CY2 backgrounds generalising previous results, which are reviewed in section 2.1. More general new solutions are reviewed in section 3, where we consider the cases of compactifications on global R4 (section 3.1), four-torus (section 3.2) and on Calabi-Yau manifolds with a circle fibration (section 3.3). All the above backgrounds are supported by a RR 3-form flux. In section 4 we provide a new emedding of minimal d = 5 supergravity, coupled to an Abeilian vector multiplet, into type IIB supergravity. In the following sections we present partial results on the spectrum of linear perturbations over the discussed family of backgrounds. In section 5 we study the spin two perturbations of the metric. The analysis of the spectrum of the spin two mode is performed for the known solutions of section 2.1 (section 5.2) and for the new family (section 5.3). The purpose of section 5.1 is to show the difference of the BPS spectrum in the case of small and large N = 4 superalgebras and explain how boundary conditions solve the problem of degeneracy. Section 6 contains the analysis of the spin one mode that is expected to be dual to the SU(2) R-current and a few coupled spin one supergravity modes. Section 7 discusses strings on orientifolds and explains the reduction of the spectrum in the case of AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7T4. We conclude in section 8. The paper also contains a number of appendices. Appendix A explains the existence of two classes of two-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds with a U(1) isometry. Appendices B.1 and B.2 review the representation theory of small and large N = 4 superalgebras respectively. Finally, in appendix C we summarize some relevant facts about spherical harmonics on the 3-sphere.\n2 Small N = (4, 0) geometries\nIn [21] a new class of AdS3 solutions realising small N = (4, 0) in type IIB supergravity was found. Solutions in this class generalise the D1-D5 near horizon geometries, AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7CY2 for CY2 = (T4,K3) via additional D5 branes and by non trivially fibering the 3-sphere over CY2. All such solutions can be expressed in the string frame form\nds2 = L 2\n\u221a h5\n[ ds2(AdS3) +\n1 4ds 2(S2) + 14D\u03c8 2 ] + \u03bb2 \u221a h5ds 2(CY2) , e\u03a6 = L2 c \u221a h5 ,\nF3 = 2c [ vol(AdS3) +\n1 8D\u03c8 \u2227 vol(S 2) ] \u2212 c4D\u03c8 \u2227 F + c\u03bb2 L2 ?4 dh5 . (2.1)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nHere (c, \u03bb, L) are constants. The coordinate \u03c8 parametrises the U(1) of the Hopf fibration of S3, which is invariant under the action of SU(2)R. The fibration over CY2 is mediated by a connection 1-form A, with support on CY2,\nD\u03c8 = d\u03c8 +A+ \u03b7, d\u03b7 = vol(S2) . (2.2)\nThe field strength of A must be anti-self dual for supersymmetry to hold,3\nF = dA, ?4F + F = 0 . (2.3)\nThe remaining fluxes are trivial.4 The metric on the 2-sphere and AdS3 has unit radius and the period of \u03c8 should be 4\u03c0k, for k an integer, when k = 1 there is a round 3-sphere, when k > 1 one has a Zk orbifold of this. The warp factor h5 has support on CY2 and away from the loci of sources, must obey\n\u22072CY2h5 + L2\n8\u03bb2F 2 = 0 , (2.4)\nwhere we define F2 = FabFab, with a, b flat directions on the unwarped CY2. Were it not for the contribution from the connection this would formally be the PDE of D5 branes back-reacted on CY2, indeed the A = 0 limit of (2.1) can actually be realised as a simple generalisation of the D1-D5-KK near horizon geometry (also preserving N = (4, 0)). The presence of the connection allows for non trivial generalisations, the near horizon realisation of these geometries is provided (modulo T-duality on \u03c8) by [29]. The presence of the warp factor in (2.1) means that it is possible to obtain bounded ten-dimensional solution for Calabi-Yau 2-folds other than (T4,K3). This is because one no longer needs to demand that CY2 is itself compact as long as the warp factor bounds it to some finite sub-region. The first example of such a solution, was given in [33] (actually predating [21]) with the warp factor bounding R4 to a finite region between O5 and D5 branes, with F = 0. As this example suggests, arranging for such a bounded solution will in general necessitate some sources, so (2.4) needs to be generalised to\n\u22072CY2h5 + L2 8\u03bb2F 2 = 1\u221a\ngCY2 \u2211 i Qi\u03b4(x\u2212 xi) , (2.5)\nwhere x are coordinates on CY2 and there are a number of sources at the loci {xi}. The Dirac delta functions are such that \u222b CY2 1\u221a gCY2\n\u03b4(x)vol(CY2) = 1. Each of these sources could be either a stack of D5 branes, an O5 plane or a coincident combination of both. The charge of a single D5 or O5 plane are given by\nQD5 = \u22122\u03ba210T5 = \u2212(2\u03c0)2 , QO5 = \u2212QD5 , (2.6)\nin units where gs = \u03b1\u2032 = 1. In the next section we shall review the solution of [33]. In the sections that follow we shall present some totally new solutions with F 6= 0. 3Note ?4 is the Hodge dual on the unwarped CY2. 4One can however turn on the RR 1-form and NS 3-form via an SL(2,R) transformation.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0"

When they are taken to be large the solution is weakly coupled every where but a tunable radi about the source D5s and O5 [33]. The charge n is related to the sources, its interpretation is a bit more subtle and depends on the interpretation of the internal space.

The latter option suggests an interesting possibility:5 One could interpret the warped CY2 as a 4-sphere, with an orientifold acting on its embedding coordinates as (y1, . . . , y5) \u2192 (\u2212y1, . . . ,\u2212y4, y5). This action has two fixed points at the poles (0, 0, 0, 0,\u00b11), which is the loci of the two sets of sources. As we view the internal space as a quotient of a compact space, the integrated form of (2.5) (with F = 0) imposes that \u2211iQi = 0. Then as there are 2 O5 planes we need 2 D5 branes to cancel their charge and so n = 1. We can use the expression of [20] to compute the holographic central charge.

At the lower bound of this interval the solution behaves as D5 branes wrapped on AdS3\u00d7S31, and at the upper bound an O5 plane wrapped on this manifold. This behavior is similar to that of section 2.1, but we stress that now F is non trivial, so for this solution S31 is non trivially fibered over S32 and the 3-form flux has additional components turned on. Despite the more complicated flux, the cycles over which we can define charges are unchanged and flux quantisation again requires that we impose that the quantities defined in (2.11) are integers, this time we can achieve this by tuning the following combinations to be integer,\nc = N5 , c\u03bb4b42(3b21 + b22)C 768\u03c02 = N1 , c(b1b2\u03bb)2C 8L2 = n , (3.13)\ngiven this we find the holographic central charge via the formula (2.13)\nchol = 6N1N5 , (3.14)\nyielding the expected relation.

D5 branes contribute negatively to \u2211iQi, and as we have two O5s in 4-sphere interpretation, this time we can have only 1 D5 coincident to the O5 at r = 0 rather than the 2 present when the fibration was trivial \u2014 hence 18b42C = 1. Of course it is possible that the internal space should be instead interpreted as a non compact space that is simply bounded, in which case there need be no such restriction on the D5 brane charge."

Integrating the single source PDE over T4 then yields R4C = Q, making Q > 0 and so consistent with an O5 source and fixes C such that it precisely cancels the O(1) term in \u03b4(x).

Answering this question requires details of the specific 4 manifold, so let us assume here that CY2 contains a U(1) isometry. The reason to do this, as we show in appendix A, is that all such manifolds fall into one of two classes both governed by a single PDE.7\nClass 1: U(1) fibration over R3. The first class of CY2 solutions containing a U(1) isometry \u2202\u03c6 can be expressed locally as\nds2(CY2) = 1\n\u2202yH (d\u03c6\u2212 \u2202x2Hdx1 + \u2202x1Hdx2)2 + \u2202yH\n( dy2 + dx21 + dx22 ) , (3.22)\nas such these solutions are U(1) fibrations over R3, where H must obey a Laplace equation on the R3 spanned by (x1, x2, y)\n\u22072R3H = 0, (3.23)\nwhere we stress that this equation is exact, it cannot have source terms as that would make the manifold not CY. For this class, the corresponding Killing spinors on CY2 are \u2202\u03c6 singlets. To embed such manifolds into the class of section 2 with non trivial fibration, we first need to define F , this can be taken to be as in (3.4) for the canonical vielbein of (A.3).8 If we take \u2202\u03c6 to be an isometry of F , then that it should also be closed requires\nfa = \u2202zaG, 2\u2202zaG\u2202za log(\u2202yH) +\u22072R3G = 0, (3.24)\nwhere za = (x1, x2, y) and G is independent of \u03c6. To have a solution one must also solve the following ODE for the warp factor\n\u22072R3h5 + L2\u2202yH\n2\u03bb2 (\u2202ziG) 2 = 0, (3.25)\naway from the loci of sources, we have assumed \u2202\u03c6 is also an isometry of h5. The simplest solution to this system is to take h and G to be linear functions of y only, one then has locally that CY2 = T4 and, generalising (3.25) to include source terms, we reproduce (3.18) of the previous section, specialised to the case where one direction in T4 remains an isometry in the full space.\nClass 2: u(1) fibrations governed by a Toda equation The second class of U(1) preserving CY2 manifolds is the more interesting, these can locally be expressed as\nds2(CY2) = 1\n\u2202y\u2206 (d\u03c6\u2212 \u2202x2\u2206dx1 + \u2202x1\u2206dx2)\n2 + \u2202y\u2206 ( dy2 + e2\u2206(dx21 + dx22) ) , (3.26)\n7This result appears in several different contexts in the literature, see for instance [47] and references there in.\n8More specifically, one should decompose E1 = e1 + ie2, E2 = e3 + ie4 then fix the functions of the vielbein as appendix A describes.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nwhere \u2206 is governed by the 3 dimensional Toda equation\n2\u220722\u2206 + \u22022ye2\u2206 = 0, (3.27)\nwhere \u220722 = \u22022x1 + \u2202 2 x2 . Note that this PDE also appears in the context of N = 2 AdS5 solutions [48], albeit here, like the previous example it should not have source terms. For this class of solutions the 3 manifold over which the U(1) is fibered itself depends on how the Toda equation is solved and the corresponding Killing spinor is charged under \u2202\u03c6.\nTo embed such manifolds into section 2 we again take the ansatz of (3.4) for the vielbein of (A.3) and impose that \u2202\u03c6 is an isometry of F . Imposing dF = 0 then requires that we fix\nf1 = \u2202yg, f2 = e\u2212\u2206\u2202x1g, f3 = e\u2212\u2206\u2202x2g, g = g(y, x1, x2), (3.28)\nand that we solve the PDE\n2 (\u2202x1g\u2202x1(log \u2202y\u2206) + \u2202x2g\u2202x2(log \u2202y\u2206)) + \u2202yg \u2202y\u2206 \u22022y(e2\u2206) +\u220722g + e2\u2206\u22022yg = 0. (3.29)\nThe PDE governing the warp factor h5, assuming it too is independent of \u03c6, is then\n\u22072h5 + \u2202y(e2\u2206\u2202y(h5)) + L2\u2202y\u2206 2\u03bb2 ( (\u2202x1g)2 + (\u2202x2g)2 + e2\u2206(\u2202yg)2 ) = 0 , (3.30)\naway from the loci of sources. An example of a solution in this class is the local solution of section 3.1, this is given by fixing\ne2\u2206 = 4y 2 (1 + x21 + x22)2 , g = \u2212 2y1 + x21 + x22\n( c1x1 + c2x2 +\nc3 2 (1\u2212 x 2 1 \u2212 x22)\n) , (3.31)\nso that (x1, x2) span a 2-sphere in stereographic coordinates. This solves both (3.27) and (3.29), (3.30) then yields (3.9) if one assumes h5 = h5(y) and identifies 4y = r2. It is our hope that the content of this section will lead to the construction of more broad classes of generalised D1-D5 near horizon solutions, ie for CY that are not locally R4, but that is beyond the scope of this work."

            "text": "It is well known that the D1-D5 near horizon admits a consistent truncation (on CY2) to minimal d = 6 (ungauged) supergravity, indeed AdS3\u00d7S3 is one of just 3 maximally supersymetric vacua of this theory [49]. It is shown in [50] (see also [51]) that the d = 6 theory can itself be consistently truncated to minimal d = 5 supergravity coupled to an abelian multiplet, which AdS3\u00d7S2 is vacua of. As the class of (2.1) is generically N = (4, 0) with the superconformal algebra realised by the AdS3 and S2 factors in the metric, it is then reasonable to ask whether this too admits a consistent truncation to d = 5, in this section we establish this is indeed the case.9\n9For resent related work on consistent truncations to d = 5, 6 gauged and un-gagued supergravities see [32, 52].\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nThe most general form of d = 5 supergravity in 5 dimensions is presented for instance in [53] (the gauge free case is when g = 0). Its bosonic sectors consists of the metric, n gauge fields AI with abelian fields strengths GI and n scalar fields XI subject to the constraint\nV = CIJKXIXJXK = 1, I, J,K = 1, . . . , n (4.1)\nwith specific models defined via a choice of V. We shall concern ourselves with a specific ungauged model with n = 2 and\nC122 = C212 = C221 = 2, CIJK = 0 otherwise, (X1)2 = (X2)\u22121 = e2\u03c6, (4.2)\nconsidered in [51], in the context of reductions between 6 and 4 dimensions. The action of the bosonic sector of this model takes the form\nS(5) = \u222b d5x \u221a \u2212g(5) (1 2R (5)\u2212 38(\u2207 (5)\u03c6)2\u2212 18e \u22122\u03c6G21\u2212 1 4e \u03c6G22 ) \u2212 112 \u222b CIJKGI \u2227GJ \u2227AK . (4.3) These fields form a gravity and vector multiplet, (g(5)\u03b1\u03b2 , A\u03b11 ) and (A\u03b12 , e\u03c6) respectively. The conditions for unbroken supersymmetry are presented in [53], 8 real supercharges is maximal and the reduction of the D1-D5 near horizon is 12 BPS [51]. To derive a consistent truncation we must generalise (2.1) such that it contains the same field content as (4.3). To this end we make the ansatz10\nds2 = L 2\n\u221a h5\n[ e\u2212 1 4\u03c6g(5)\u00b5\u03bd dx\n\u00b5dx\u00b5 + 14e 3 4\u03c6D\u03c82\n] + \u03bb2e 3 4\u03c6 \u221a h5ds 2(CY2), e\u03a6 = e 3 4\u03c6 L2\nc \u221a h5 ,\nF3 = ce\u22122\u03c6 ?5 G1 + c\u03bb2\nL2 ?4 dh5 +\nc 4D\u03c8 \u2227 [ 2G2 \u2212F ] , D\u03c8 = d\u03c8 + 2A2 +A. (4.4)\nOne then needs to check that the ansatz solves the type IIB equations of motion. In string frame, these can be expressed in the form\ndF3 = 0, d ? F3 = 0, (4.5a)\nD = e2\u03a6(\u22072\u03a6\u2212 2(\u2207\u03a6)2)\u2212 12F 2 3 = 0, (4.5b)\nEAB = e\u22122\u03a6 ( RAB + 2\u2207A\u2207B\u03a6 +\n1 4gAB(\u2207 2\u03a6\u2212 2(\u2207\u03a6)2) ) \u2212 14(F 2 3 )AB + 1 48gABF 2 3 = 0,\n(4.5c) 10So as not to make the presentation overly long, we are simply presenting the answer, to actually derive this one needs to start with a more general ansatz depending on only the bosonic fields of the d = 5 theory. For instance for metric one can take\nds2 = L 2\n\u221a h5\n[ ec1\u03c6g(5)\u00b5\u03bd dx\n\u00b5dx\u00b5 + 14e c2\u03c6D\u03c82\n] + \u03bb2ec3\u03c6 \u221a h5ds 2(CY2), D\u03c8 = d\u03c8 + c4A1 + c5A2 +A\nwhere ci are arbitrary constants. One then takes similar ansatze for the dilaton and 3-form, depending on more arbitrary constants. Finally one fixes these constants by demanding the d = 10 equations of motion hold when the d = 5 equations of motion, (2.4) and the properties of F (closed and anti-selfdual) are assumed to.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nwhere (A,B, . . .) are ten dimensional indices and we define F 23 = (F3)ABC(F3)ABC and (F 23 )AB = (F3) CDA (F3)BCD. It is a simple matter to show that the Bianchi identity and EOM of F3 (4.5a) reduce to\nd(e\u22122\u03c6 ?5 G1) +G2 \u2227G2 = 0, d(e\u03c6 ?5 G2) +G1 \u2227G2 = 0, (4.6)\ngiven (2.4), that (G1, G2,F) are closed and F is anti self dual. It is not hard to show that this is precisely what one gets by varying (4.3) with respect to A1 and A2 respectively. The ten dimensional dilaton EOM (4.5b) expanded out on our ansatz becomes\nD = c 2e\u2212 9 4\u03c6\n2L4\u03bb2 \u221a h5\n( \u22072CY2h4 + L2 8\u03bb2F 2 ) \u2212 c 2 L6 \u221a \u2212g(5) e\u2212 5 4\u03c6h 3 2 5 \u03b4S(5) \u03b4\u03c6 , (4.7)\nwith the first term vanishing by (2.4) and the second by the EOM of the d = 5 theory. Proving that all components of EAB = 0 is a more lengthy computation, though this also follows from the EOM that (4.3) implies, (2.4), the anti-self duality of F and\nFacF cb = 1 4 g (4) ab F 2 , (4.8)\nwhere a, b . . . are indices on CY2 and g(4)ab is its unwarped metric. This final conditions actually follows from the anti-self duality of F . Finally we should stress that, although we have not spoken of them explicitly in this section until now, there is no barrier to performing this truncation in the presence of sources. If they are consistent for (2.1), then they are too for (4.4) as they cancel between the D = 10 EOM and the generalised Laplace for h5 in the same way for each. We have thus derived a new embedding of d = 5 ungauged supergravity+ abelian vector multiplet into type IIB supergravity, containing a circle fibration over CY2 and potential source terms. When a solution to the D = 5 supergravity is supersymmetric, we expect the lifted solution to also preserve supersymmmetry, though we have not checked this explicitly."

This will be a first step in the computation of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and possibly the operator spectrum in the dual CFT2. Computing the full spectrum is a difficult task in general, indeed until recently this had only been managed for solutions that decompose as direct products of co-set spaces (i.e. AdS4\u00d7S7 [35], AdS5\u00d7S5 [36], AdS5\u00d7T1,1 [37], AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7K3 [54], see however [55\u201359] for the detailed analysis of a subsector of a warped AdS5\u00d7T1,1). This changed with the advent of so-called \u201cKaluza-Klein spectrometry\u201d [38\u201340, 60, 61], which uses the frame work of exceptional field theory to compute the spectrum of any solution admitting a consistent truncation to a maximal gauged supergravity. Unfortunately this frame work is rather less developed for AdS3 vacua than their higher dimensional counter parts, see [40] for an example. Additionally spectroscopy for solutions that do not admit a truncation to\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nmaximal or half maximal (for the case of AdS3) gauged supergravity is yet to be worked out. The solutions within section 2 hit both of these stumbling blocks, so in this work we shall set ourselves the more modest goal of finding some modes that decouple from the main system, allowing us to compute their spectra with more traditional means. In [41] a universal equation was derived for spin 2 fluctuations on maximally symmetric spaces embedded into type IIB supergravity.11 The original derivation is done for 4- dimensional symmetric spaces, but it is straightforward to generalise it to the general case. The starting point is a metric of the form\nds2 = GMNdXMdXN = e2Ag\u00b5\u03bddx\u00b5dx\u03bd + g\u0302abdyadyb . (5.1)\nOne considers the fluctuations along the symmetric space directions x\u00b5,\n\u03b4g\u00b5\u03bd = e2Ah\u00b5\u03bd , \u03b4g\u0302ab = 0 .

This equation is equivalent to the equation of a scalar particle of mass M in the symmetric space. From the point of view of the AdS/CFT correspondence (M being AdSn space) the equation describes an operator of dimension\n\u2206 = n\u2212 12 + \u221a( n\u2212 1 2 )2 +M2 (5.7)\nin the dual CFTn\u22121. Here M and k are assumed to be in units of the curvature radius, whenever appropriate. As in standard separation of variables, the mass M is determined by an eigenvalue problem for the second factor \u03a8(y) in (5.4), in the internal space. For an n-dimensional maximally symmetric space embedded into d total dimensions the generalisation of the equation for \u03a8(y) is [\ne(2\u2212n)A\u221a g\u0302 \u2202ya\n( enA \u221a g\u0302g\u0302ab\u2202yb ) ] \u03a8 = \u2212M2\u03a8 .

For the fibred solutions (2.1) with F 6= 0, i.e. the ones considered in section 3, the equation becomes(\n\u22072S3 + L2\nh5\u03bb2\n[ \u22072CY2 + |A| 2\u22022\u03c8 \u2212 2\u2207A\u2202\u03c8 \u2212 (\u2207CY2 .A)\u2202\u03c8 ]) \u03a8 = \u2212M2\u03a8 , (5.12)\nwhere |A|2 is the norm defined on CY2 rather than its warped equivalent, similarly for \u2207A and one is free to choose a gauge in which \u2207CY2 .A = 0. One can also show that this perturbation of the metric decouples from all the remaining fluctuations of the type IIB fields and the D brane sources. Consequently, equation (5.8) describes a consistent spin 2 mode for a large number of holographic backgrounds. In the examples below we will analyse the spectrum of the dual operators described by this mode.\n5.1 Large N = (4, 0) example: AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7S3 \u00d7 R\nBefore discussing the spectrum on the backgrounds described in sections 2 and 3 we would like to consider a more simple class of solutions. One of the purposes of this exercise is to see the interplay of the BPS conditions in supergravity and CFT. We will also use the simple example to introduce general boundary conditions to be used in the remaining part. In [33] a solution with D8 branes on AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7S3 \u00d7 R was constructed. For this one takes\ne2A = L 2\n\u221a h8 , e\u2212\u03a6 = ch\n5 4 8 , ds 2(M7) = c2 \u221a h8dr 2+ L 2\n\u221a h8 [ 1 cos2\u03b2 ds 2(S31)+ 1 sin2\u03b2 ds2(S32) ] ,\n(5.13) where L, c and \u03b2 are constants. The parameter \u03b2 sets the relative radii of the spheres in such a way that\n1 R2S31 + 1 R2S32 = 1 L2 = 1 R2AdS3 . (5.14)\nThe warp factor h8 is a piecewise linear function such that in a linear interval the D8 brane flux is given by\n\u2202rh8 = F0 , (5.15)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nwhere F0 is the value of the flux that jumps at the position of D8 branes along r direction producing a discontinuity in \u2202rh8. A compact solution is an interval bounded between two D8/O8 systems, say at r = r\u00b1. Since h8(r\u00b1) = 0 there should be at least one locus of D8 branes inside the interval. Patches of continuous solutions should be glued appropriately at the loci of D8.\nFrom (5.8), we find that in the background (5.13),[ L2\nc2h8 \u22022r + cos2\u03b2\u22072S31 + sin 2\u03b2\u22072S32 +M 2 ] \u03a8 = 0 . (5.16)\nThis has a structure similar to (5.11). Taking the mode expansion\n\u03a8 = \u2211 `1,`2 H`1,`2(r)Y `1 S31 Y `2S32 , (5.17)\nwhere the scalar harmonics on the spheres satisfy \u22072 S3i Y `iS3i = (1\u2212 (`i + 1)2)Y `iS31 . Since the equation has SO(4)\u00d7SO(4) symmetry we suppress the summation over the projections of the spins, which label the complete eigenfunction basis (see appendix C for more details). We find\n1 h8 \u22022rH`1 `2 +\n\u03ba2`1,`2c 2\nL2 H`1,`2 = 0 , \u03ba2`1,`2 = M 2 \u2212 `1(`1 + 2) cos2\u03b2 \u2212 `2(`2 + 2) sin2\u03b2 . (5.18)\nConsequently one needs to solve a Sturm-Liouville problem for this equation, for which a choice of boundary conditions should be made on the interval r \u2208 [r\u2212, r+]. Let us first discuss boundary conditions at the endpoints (O8 positions). One way to motivate the choice is to note that the variational principle for fluctuations requires a treatment of the boundary terms in the variation of the action, cf. [41]. From the form of equation (5.10) one can see that the universal boundary terms are of the form\n\u03b4\u03a8 e3A\u22122\u03a6 \u221a g\u0302g\u0302rr\u2202r\u03a8 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=r\u00b1 \u2192 \u03b4H`1,`2\u2202rH`1,`2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=r\u00b1 . (5.19)\nFor the variational principle to be completely defined one needs to project out these boundary terms by either imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions \u03b4H`1,`2 |r=r\u00b1 = 0, that is choosing fixed values for the fluctuations on the boundary, or Neumann boundary conditions \u2202rH`1,`2 |r=r\u00b1 = 0. Note that for generic supergravity fields the above boundary terms, and consequently boundary conditions can receive additional non-universal terms coming from D-brane sources, localized on the boundaries. However, it was argued in [41] that such boundary sources decouple from the spin two mode considered here. Note that for the internal geometries of the form S3\u00d7CY2 fibred over an interval r \u2208 [r\u2212, r+], which we consider here, equation (5.10) has the canonical form of a SturmLiouville problem,\n\u2202r (p(r)\u2202rH`1 `2) + \u03b22`1,`2q(r)H`1 `2 = 0 , (5.20)\nwith p(r) = e3A\u22122\u03a6 \u221a g\u0302g\u0302rr , and q(r) = eA\u22122\u03a6 \u221a g\u0302 , (5.21)\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nmodulo constants that can be absorbed into M2 \u2192 \u03b22`1,`2 . Hence, the Neumann boundary conditions are generalized to\nNeumann: p(r)\u2202rH`1,`2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=r\u00b1 = 0 , (5.22)\nallowing for a singularity of \u2202rH`1,`2 at the boundary if p(r) vanishes there. This boundary condition implies positivity of the eigenvalues \u03b22`1,`2 (unitarity),\n\u03b22`1,`2 ||H`1,`2 || 2 \u2261 \u03b22`1,`2 r+\u222b r\u2212 dr q(r) (H`1,`2) 2 = r+\u222b r\u2212 dr p(r) (\u2202rH`1,`2) 2\n\u2212 \u03b22`1,`2p(r)H`1,`2\u2202rH`1,`2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223r+ r\u2212 \u2265 0 . (5.23)\nBesides the boundary conditions, we require the natural norm defined with respect to the weight q(r) to be finite. For the Dirichlet boundary conditions to be consistent with the bound \u03b22`1,`2 \u2265 0, one has to select a stronger form of the latter,12\nDirichlet: H`1,`2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=r\u00b1 = 0 . (5.24)\nThe final choice of the boundary conditions depends on further details of the problem. As outlined in the introduction discussion of the conditions at the loci of D branes and O planes is in general tricky, because of possible ambiguities and because the supergravity approximation breaks down in the vicinity of these objects. However, in some cases, a natural choice can be made based on the analyticity and normalizability of fluctuations.\nIn terms of the above problem, the non-negativity of the eigenvalues \u03b22`1,`2 \u2265 0 implies\nM2 \u2265 `1(`1 + 2) cos2\u03b2 + `2(`2 + 2) sin2\u03b2 . (5.25)\nThis relation can be compared with the BPS bounds in the supergravity algebra D(2, 1|\u03b1) [7, 63], or in the large N = (4, 0) superconformal algebra A\u03b3 of the dual CFT [64]. The three bounds agree if and only if `1 = `2 = `. Indeed, the analysis of the shortening condition in the D(2, 1|\u03b1) superalgebra implies\n\u2206(2) = 1 + \u221a 1 +M2 \u2265 `1 cos2\u03b2 + `2 sin2\u03b2 + 2 , \u03b1 = tan2\u03b2 , \u03b3 = sin2\u03b2 , (5.26)\nwhere the shift by two units appears because we compare the upper components of the multiplets, and the above statement follows. Moreover, one can also see that states with `1 6= `2 saturating the D(2, 1|\u03b1) bound (5.26) violate the eigenvalue bound (5.25) and therefore are absent from the supergravity spectrum.13\n12These boundary conditions are consistent with the ones advocated in [42, 43], where a similar analysis was performed.\n13The fact that supergravity imposes the condition `1 = `2 on the D(2, 1|\u03b1) spectrum was noted in [34] in the context of AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7S3\u00d7S1 background. This helped to explain the absence of the superfluous states from the early Kaluza-Klein analysis of [7].\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nFinally, we note that only Neumann boundary conditions for H`1,`2 are compatible with the BPS spectrum, since the zero modes of (5.20) are simply constant functions. We note that Neumann boundary conditions at the locus of the O8 are compatible with the symmetry of the orbifold action, so we will focus on these boundary conditions for the O planes in the rest of this paper. Boundary conditions at the D-brane positions will depend on the specific setup. In particular, at the loci of D8 inside the interval, we demand continuity of the function and its derivative, since discontinuities would manifest themselves through delta functions, that is source terms in the equation, while the spin two equation was shown to decouple from any sources, cf. the discussion in section 4.3 of [42]. As far as the non-BPS spectrum is concerned, we will consider several different cases. First, h8 = 1 is the case of the trivial warping, for which one obtains\nH`1,`2 = A`1,`2 cos ( \u03ba`1,`2c\nL r\n) +B`1,`2 sin ( \u03ba`1,`2c\nL r\n) . (5.27)\nIf the space is non-compact, the spectrum is continuous. If we instead consider the compact case AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7S3\u00d7S1, there is a discrete tower of non-BPS states with\nM2 = `1(`1 + 2) cos2\u03b2 + `2(`2 + 2) sin2\u03b2 + 4\u03c02n2L2\n(r+ \u2212 r\u2212)2c2 , (5.28)\nlabeled by integer n. Since in more general case the warp factor is a linear function, one can express the solution to equation (5.18) in terms of Airy functions, albeit of a complex argument. Let us consider the situation r\u00b1 = \u00b1r0 and D8 branes at r = 0, so that\nh8 = F0 \u00b7 (r0 + r) , \u2212r0 \u2264 r < 0 ,F0 \u00b7 (r0 \u2212 r) , 0 < r \u2264 r0 (5.29) The general solutions to equation (5.18) satisfying Neumann boundary conditions H \u2032`1,`2(\u00b1r0) = 0 at r = \u00b1r0 are\nH`1,`2 = A\u00b1`1,`2 0F1 ( 2 3; F0\u03ba 2 `1,`2 9 c2 L2 (\u00b1r \u2212 r0)3 ) . (5.30)\nGluing together the \u00b1 branches at r = 0 requires the full solution to be an even function. The problem reduces to finding zeroes of the derivative of the hypergeometric function at r = 0. The corresponding discrete spectrum can be found numerically or via the WKB method, which gives the following approximation:\nM2 ' `1(`1 + 2) cos2\u03b2 + `2(`2 + 2) sin2\u03b2 + 9\u03c02n2L2 4F0r30c2 .

We remind the reader that the geometry describes D5 branes and O5 planes back reacted on R4. As discussed in section 2.1, one has an O5 located at \u03c1 = 0 and either\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\na single D5, or a pair of D5 with an O5 at \u03c1 = \u03c0/2.14 Consequently, we shall refer to the above points as O5 and D5 loci respectively.

(5.38)\nThe functions p(r) and q(r) (5.21) defining the Sturm-Liouville problem (5.20) in this case read\np(r) = r3 , q(r) = r(1\u2212 r2) . (5.39)\n14We start this section using coordinate \u03c1 (not to be mixed with the spacetime index), which is the convention of [33], where the background solution was originally constructed, and of section 2.1. However, the equations are simpler when written in terms of the natural radial coordinate r = cos \u03c1.\n15From this moment on, unless explicitly stated, the capital indices M , N , P , . . . are 10-dimensional indices, lowercase Greek indices label AdS3 direction, lowercase Latin indices a, b, c label the directions of the first S3 factor and i, j, k \u2014 the directions along S3 in CY2.\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nThe general solution of the above equation is in terms of the modified Bessel functions,\nH`1,`2 = C1 K\u03bd\u03b2 (\u03b2r)\nr + C2 I\u03bd\u03b2 (\u03b2r) r . (5.40)\nIf \u03bd\u03b2 is a real (we can assume it is positive), the function K\u03bd\u03b2 (r) \u223c r\u2212\u03bd\u03b2 , for small r, so the corresponding solution is neither normalisable, nor satisfying the admissible boundary conditions (5.22) or (5.24) at r = 0. The second, linearly independent solution, has an admissible behaviour at r \u2192 0, however one cannot in general satisfy either boundary condition at r = 1, because I\u03bd\u03b2 (\u03b2r) is a monotonous function for real \u03b2 and \u03bd\u03b2. If \u03b2 is imaginary, then function I\u03bd\u03b2 (\u03b2r) is substituted by J\u03bd\u03b2 ( \u221a \u2212\u03b22r), which is an oscillating function. Yet, the boundary conditions cannot be satisfied, because of the dependence of the parameter \u03bd\u03b2 on \u03b2. This is a consequence of the positivity of the norm, as in the calculation (5.23). The latter implies\n\u03b22 \u2265 `2(`2 + 2) \u222b dr r|H|2\n||H`1,`2 ||2 \u2265 0 . (5.41)\nTherefore there are no eigenvalues with imaginary \u03b2. Besides, the above relation implies that only states with `2 = 0 can saturate the BPS bound of the N = (4, 0) superconformal algebra, which is precisely \u03b22 \u2265 0 (see appendix B.1). Hence, for real \u03bd\u03b2 the only way to satisfy the boundary condition at r = 1 is to set \u03b2 = `2 = 0, which makes H`1,`2 a constant function. This case corresponds to BPS states with\nM2 = `1(`1 + 2) , \u2206 = `1 + 2 . (5.42)\nlabelled by `1 and containing the energy-momentum operator \u2206 = 2. The remaining possibility to analyse, is the case of \u03bd2\u03b2 < 0. This is expected as \u03b2 grows for fixed `2 (larger M2). At \u03bd\u03b2 = 0 the Bessel functions change their behaviour to oscillating (as r\u03bd\u03b2 close to r = 0) and, in fact, non-normalisable (with a logarithmically diverging norm). For this reason, we discard this continuum of values above\nM2 = `1(`1 + 2) + c b (`2 + 1)2 . (5.43)\nAltogether, on the background (2.10), the transverse traceless spin-two fluctuation h\u00b5\u03bd gives rise only to BPS branch (5.42)."

Upon separation of variables, this equation reduces to equation (5.12) for the factor depending on the compact space coordinates. As expected, the symmetry of the 3-sphere S31 is broken down to SU(2)\u00d7U(1). This breaking is manifest in the second line of the above equation. Despite this generalisation, it is still convenient to use the basis of the scalar spherical harmonics on the round S3 to expand the solution, that is we can use the substitution (5.17). The last line of (5.44) can be expressed as the Lie derivative with respect to connection A, which is expanded as (3.8) in terms of the left invariant forms on S32, that is\n\u2207AY `2S32 \u2261 LAY `2 S32 = \u2211 a caLKRa Y `2 S32 , (5.45)\nwhere KRa are right invariant Killing vectors, dual to the left invariant forms on S32, which act as the regular set of ladder operators (proper normalization of the harmonics is assumed),\nLKR1 \u00b1iKR2 Y ` mR,mL =\u2212i\n\u221a `\n4(`+2)\u2212m R(mR\u00b11)Y `mR\u00b11,mL , LKR3 Y ` mR,mL = im RY `mR,mL .\n(5.46) Here we made explicit the quantum numbers of the spherical harmonics, with (`L,mL) and (`R,mR) being the pairs of ` and projection \u2212`/2 \u2264 m \u2264 `/2 quantum numbers with respect to SU(2)L\u00d7SU(2)R (for the scalar harmonics `L = `R = `).

Then the off-diagonal terms drop out and the equation can be cast in the form\n\u22022H mR1 `1\n\u2202r2 + 3 r\n\u2202H mR1 `1 \u2202r + ( \u03b11 + \u03b12 r2 \u2212 \u03b13r2 ) H mR1 `1 = 0 , (5.49)\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nwith \u03b11 = a1\u03b22, \u03b12 = a2\u03b22 , \u03b13 = a3\u03b22 + 4a3 \u03bb2\nL2 (mR1 )2 . (5.50)\nIn the above formulae \u03b22 = \u03bb 2\nL2\n( M2 \u2212 `1(`1 + 2) ) (5.51)\nand a1, a2, a3 = C/8 > 0 are the parameters of the warp factor (3.9). From (5.21) we find p(r) = r3 , q(r) = r3h5 = r3 ( a1 +\na2 r2 \u2212 a3r2\n) . (5.52)\nWith this we can derive a bound on the eigenvalues,\n\u03b22 \u2265 4a3 \u03bb2\nL2 (mR1 )2\n\u222b dr r5|H|2\n||H`1,`2 ||2 \u2265 0 . (5.53)\nThe bound is only compatible with the BPS bound of N = (4, 0) superconformal algebra if mR1 = 0. While in the analysis of section 5.2 we observed a degeneracy of the BPS spectrum with respect to the projection of momentum `1, due to the full SO(4) symmetry, here only the states with zero projection are BPS. In particular, this excludes the states with odd `1. Another feature of the generalized background is that non-BPS states exist for some values of the parameters, as we will see.\nWe can write the general solution to equation (5.49),\nH mR1 `1\n= r\u03b1\u22121e\u2212 \u221a \u03b13 2 r 2 { C1L \u03b1 \u03bd (\u221a \u03b13r 2 ) + C2U ( \u2212\u03bd, 1 + \u03b1,\u221a\u03b13r2 )} , (5.54)\nwhere La\u03bd(x) are the generalised Laguerre polynomials, U is the hypergeometric U(a, b, x) function (Kummer\u2019s function of the second kind) and the parameters are\n\u03b1 = \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b12 , \u03bd = \u03b11 \u221a \u03b13 \u2212 2\u03b13(1 + \u03b1)\n4\u03b13 . (5.55)\nFor r \u2192 0 the asymptotic form of the solution is\nH mR1 `1 \u223c r\u22121\u00b1\n\u221a 1\u2212\u03b12 . (5.56)\nNote that the sign of \u03b12 distinguishes the D5-O5 (3.12) and O5-O5 (3.15) configurations. For \u03b12 > 0 we are in the D5-O5 case, of which the analysis of section 5.2 has treated a particular representative. As in section 5.2, we observe a cut, where the solutions become infinitely oscillating and unnormalisable. In the generalised background this happens when\nM2 = `1(`1 + 2) + 8L2\nb21b 2 2\u03bb\n2C = `1(`1 + 2) + N5 n , (5.57)\nwhere we used parametrisation (3.11) of the warp factor. Now, in the general D5-O5 case a finite number of eigenvalues is possible below the threshold. The spectrum of the eigenvalues is defined by zeroes of the above special functions and of their derivatives. The latter can be determined numerically. It is convenient to make a rescaling of the parameters,\nr2 = L\u221a a3\u03bb r\u03022 , b21 = L \u221a a3\u03bb b\u030221 , b 2 2 = L \u221a a3\u03bb b\u030222 , \u03b2 2 = \u03bb\n2\nL2 \u03b2\u03022 . (5.58)\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nWe can also set b\u03022 = 1 without loss of generality. Equation (5.49) then takes the following form\n\u22022H mR1 `1\n\u2202r\u03022 + 3 r\u0302\n\u2202H mR1 `1\n\u2202r\u0302 + \u03b2\u03022 (b\u0302 2 1 + r\u03022)(1\u2212 r\u03022) r\u03022 H mR1 `1 \u2212 4r\u03022(mR1 )2H mR1 `1 = 0 , (5.59)\nThe normalisable solution to this equation is the one in (5.54), in terms of the generalised Laguerre polynomial.\nH mR1 `1 = r\u0302\u03b1\u22121e\u2212 \u03ba 2 r\u0302 2 L\u03b1\u03bd (\u03bar\u03022) , (5.60)\nwhere now\n\u03ba = \u221a \u03b2\u03022 + 4(mR1 )2 , \u03b1 = \u221a 1\u2212 b\u030221\u03b2\u03022 , \u03bd = \u03b2\u03022(1\u2212 b\u030221) 4\u03ba \u2212 1 + \u03b1 2 .\n(5.61)\nAs was noticed in the previous analysis, the BPS spectrum is only compatible with the Neumann boundary conditions at the position of O5, that is at r = b2 (r\u0302 = 1). Therefore we impose the condition\n\u2202r\u0302H mR1 `1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 r\u0302=1 = 0 (5.62)\non solution (5.60). The spectrum of the eigenvalues is shown in figure 1 as a function of the parameter a, which coincides with b\u030221 for a > 0 (a is the same as the rescaled parameter a2 in the warp factor). As anticipated, there is a finite number of eigenvalues below a cut with the continuum of unnormalizable solutions. The profile of the cut is defined by the bound (5.57). For example, for mR1 = 0 and a > 0.04555 one finds no non-BPS states below the continuum threshold. Conversely the number of eigenvalues increases as a approaches zero. The exact limit b\u03021 = a = a2 = 0 is in fact the intermediate case with the solution bounded between a single O5 plan and a regular zero, while for a < 0 one is in the O5-O5 configuration (section 3.1.2), so that a = \u2212b\u030221. In the latter case equation (5.59) is modified as follows,\n\u22022H mR1 `1\n\u2202r\u03022 + 3 r\u0302\n\u2202H mR1 `1\n\u2202r\u0302 + \u03b2\u03022 (b\u0302 2 1 \u2212 r\u03022)(r\u03022 \u2212 1) r\u03022 H mR1 `1 \u2212 4r\u03022(mR1 )2H mR1 `1 = 0 , (5.63)\nand its regular solution reads\nH mR1 `1 = r\u0302\u03b1\u0304\u22121e \u03ba 2 r\u0302 2 L\u03b1\u0304\u03bd\u0304 (\u2212\u03bar\u03022) , (5.64)\nwith modified parameters\n\u03b1\u0304 = \u221a 1 + b\u030221\u03b2\u03022 , \u03bd\u0304 = \u2212 \u03b2\u03022(b\u030221 + 1) 4\u03ba \u2212 (1 + \u03b1\u0304) 2 . (5.65)\nAgain, we stick to Neumann boundary conditions, and the results of the analysis can be found in figure 1 as a continuation of the spectrum to negative a. In this branch the spectrum is discrete and unbounded. Now let us turn on `2. For `2 6= 0 we will restrict our analysis to c1 = c2 = 0, with non-vanishing c3. This keeps eigenmode equations (5.47) diagonal. The equations also take the form (5.49), but this time with\n\u03b11 = a1\u03b22 + 2c3mR1 mR2 , \u03b12 = a2\u03b22 \u2212 `2(`2 + 2) , \u03b13 = a3\u03b22 + c23 4 (m R 1 )2 , (5.66)\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nFigure 1. Spectrum of the first five eigenvalues \u03b2\u03022 of equation (5.59) for mR1 = 0,\u22121/2, 1/2, 1 (as labelled). The case mR1 = 0 contains an additional line at \u03b2\u03022 = 0 representing the BPS families of spin-two states in the backgrounds of section 3 labelled by `1. The remaining curves represent non-BPS families with `2 = 0 and any `1 \u2265 2mR1 . The parameter a interpolates between the O5-O5 configuration (a = \u2212b\u030221 \u2264 0) and the D5-O5 one (a = b\u030221 > 0). The O5-O5 configuration shows an unbounded discrete spectrum. For the D5-O5 case the discrete spectrum is bounded from above by a cut separating the continuum of unnormalizable solutions (shaded region).\nwhere we used the relation between a3 and c3 provided by equations (3.7) and (3.9). Before we discuss the spectrum let us check the bound on the eigenvalue \u03b22. The same type of argument as before yields\n\u03b22 \u2265 1 ||H`1,`2 ||2\n\u222b dr r3|H|2 `2(`2 + 2)\u2212 4(mR2 )2 r2 + ( c3m R 1 r 2 \u2212 2mR2 r )2 , (5.67) which generalises the previous bounds (5.41) and (5.53) and is compatible with the BPS bound of the superalgebra \u03b22 \u2265 0. The BPS bound can only be saturated by configurations with `2 = 0 and mR1 = 0.\nThe asymptotic solution at r \u2192 0 has the form\nH mR1 ,m R 2 `1,`2 \u223c r\u22121\u00b1\n\u221a (`2+1)2\u2212a2\u03b22 . (5.68)\nThe branch with minus sign is not normalisable with q from equation (5.21). The branch with plus sign is only normalisable if a2\u03b22 < (`2 + 1)2. For a2 > 0, which is the case of the\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nFigure 2. Spectrum of the first six non-BPS families of eigenvalues \u03b2\u03022 of equation (5.49) with parameters given by (5.66), `1 = 0 and a few choices for `2 and mR2 (as labelled). Parameter a is defined as in figure 1.\nD5-O5 configuration, the normalisable spectrum is bounded,\n0 \u2264 \u03b22 < (`2 + 1) 2\na2 = N5 n (`2 + 1)2 , (5.69)\nwhich generalises the bound (5.57) to arbitrary `2. For a2 < 0 (O5-O5) the upper bound disappears and the spectrum is only bounded from below. The general solution is the same as equation (5.54) but with the updated values of the parameters (5.66). The generalised Laguerre polynomial represents the normalisable branch. The spectrum for some choices of quantum numbers with `2 6= 0 is shown in figures 2 and 3.\n6 SU(2)R current mode\nThe stress-energy tensor is the highest component of the short superconformal multiplet (appendix B.1), which also contains the SU(2) R current triplet as the remaining (lowest) bosonic components. In this section we will construct and analyse the dual supergravity mode. We shall only consider the simplest background (2.10) of the family (2.1). The supergravity mode dual to the SU(2) R currents should correspond to the fluctuation of the metric that is a vector on each of AdS3 and S31.\n\u03b4g = 2R\u00b5adx\u00b5d\u03c6a = 2A\u00b5(x\u00b5, yi)Y (`1,\u00b11)a,1 dx\u00b5d\u03c6a , (6.1)\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nFigure 3. Spectrum of the first six non-BPS families of eigenvalues \u03b2\u03022 of equation (5.49) with parameters given by (5.66) and a few choices of `1 6= 0, mR1 , `2 and mR2 (as labelled). Parameter a is defined as in figure 1.\nwhere x\u00b5 and yi are AdS3 and CY2 coordinates and \u03c6a and Y (`1,\u00b11)a,1 are the coordinates and vector harmonics on S31 respectively.16 The latter are labeled by the sum `1 = j1 + j\u03041 of the two spins of SU(2)\u00d7SU(2)'SO(4), while the difference is fixed to \u00b11.\nIt turns out that perturbing the above metric component alone does not lead to a consistent set of linearised equations. The minimal consistent ansatz requires one to perturb the Ramond 3-form as well,\n\u03b4C2 = C\u00b5a dx\u00b5 \u2227 dxa . (6.2)\nThe perturbations R\u00b5a and C\u00b5a do provide a well-defined system of linearised equations.17\nNote that the left and right vector spherical harmonics on S3 of unit radius satisfy\n\u0302 bca \u2202bY (`,\u00b11) c = \u00b1(`+ 1)Y (`,\u00b11)a , (6.3)\nwhere the indices are raised with the S3 metric and \u0302 is the covariant Levi-Civita tensor. This equation reflects the fact that the harmonics form a representation of SU(2). It can also be viewed as a \u201csquare root\u201d of the Laplacian eigenvalue equation. Indeed, applying\n16In this section we use Greek indices \u00b5, \u03bd, \u03c1, . . . for the AdS3 directions, Latin indices a, b, c, . . . for the directions along S3 and i, j, k, . . . for the CY2.\n17We label the modes following conventions of [34, 54].\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nthe differential operator twice on the left hand side yields\n\u2207\u0302d\u2207\u0302dY (`,\u00b11)a = (2\u2212 (`+ 1)2)Y (`,\u00b11)a , (6.4)\nwhich is the correct action of the Laplacian on the harmonics. As before we dress with hats the operators defined with respect to constant curvature unit radius metric on either S3 or AdS3. Similar relations are satisfied by the AdS3 wavefunctions. The appropriate basis is that of the representations of SL(2), satisfying an analog of (6.3),\n\u0302 \u03c1\u03b7\u00b5 \u2202\u03c1R (\u2206,\u00b11) \u03b7a = \u2213(\u2206\u2212 1)R(\u2206,\u00b11)\u00b5a . (6.5)\nDifferent signs correspond to the choice of the left (h\u2212 h\u0304 = 1) or the right (h\u2212 h\u0304 = \u22121) mover sectors, \u2206 = h+ h\u0304. Then\n\u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u03c1R(\u2206,\u00b11)\u00b5a \u2212 \u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u00b5R(\u2206,\u00b11)\u03c1a = (\u2206\u2212 1)2R(\u2206,\u00b11)\u00b5a . (6.6)\nThe latter is the equation for the vector field of mass M2 = (\u2206\u2212 1)2 in AdS3 measured in the units of the inverse radius, which is the correct relation between the AdS mass and the conformal dimension \u2206 of the operator dual to a vector field.\nImposing the additional transversality condition \u2207\u0302\u03c1R\u03c1a = 0 casts (6.6) in the form\n\u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u03c1R(\u2206,\u00b11)\u00b5a = ( (\u2206\u2212 1)2 \u2212 2 ) R(\u2206,\u00b11)\u00b5a , (6.7)\nwhich is the analog of (6.4). One can check that linearized fluctuations (6.1) and (6.2) only contribute to Einstein and F3 equations of motion [75], which in string frame yield\n\u2212\u2207P\u2207PRMN +\u2207P\u2207MRNP +\u2207P\u2207NRMP + 2 (\u2207PRMN \u2212\u2207NRPM \u2212\u2207MRPN ) \u2202P\u03a6 + e 2\u03a6\n12 FPQRF PQRRMN \u2212\ne2\u03a6\n2 SMPQF PQ N \u2212\ne2\u03a6\n2 SNPQF PQ M = 0 , (6.8)\nand\n\u2202M (\u221a gSMRS ) \u2212 \u2202M (\u221a gRMPF RSP ) \u2212 \u2202M ( RRP )\u221a gFPSM + \u2202M ( RSP )\u221a gFPRM = 0 .\n(6.9) Here SMNP are the components of the 3-form field strength tensor of the 2-form C\u00b5a.\nIn fact, R\u00b5a also contributes to the dilaton equation of motion, but this contribution\n\u2207\u0302\u00b5\u2207\u0302aR a\u00b5 = 0 , (6.10)\nonly affects the gauge dependent part of the equations. If we fix the gauge with the local transversality conditions\n\u2207\u0302\u03bdR\u03bda = 0 , \u2207\u0302bR\u00b5b = 0 , \u2207\u0302\u03bdC\u03bda = 0 , \u2207\u0302bC\u00b5b = 0 , (6.11)\nthen the dilaton and all the components of Einstein and F3 equations decouple, with the exception of the components \u00b5a, that is those with one leg along AdS3 and the other along\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nthe first S3. In a separate work [75] we show that the considered fluctuations also decouple from space-time filling sources, ie of the type contained in the solutions we consider. The equations become simpler if the metric perturbation is of the form RMN = e\u03a6VMN . In terms of V\u00b5a we get\n1 L2 \u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u03c1V\u00b5a \u2212 1 L2 \u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u00b5V\u03c1a + 1 L2 \u2207\u0302c\u2207\u0302cV\u00b5a \u2212 1 L2 \u2207\u0302c\u2207\u0302aV\u00b5c + 1 h5\u03bb2 \u22072CY2V\u00b5a\u2212 \u2212 2 L2 ( \u0302\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u2202 \u03bbC\u03bda \u2212 \u0302abc\u2202cC b\u00b5 ) = 0 , (6.12)\nwhere again \u2207\u0302 and \u0302 with Greek or Latin indices refer to the covariant derivatives and covariant Levi-Civita symbols on AdS3 and S3 of unit radii respectively, and\n1 L2 \u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u03c1C\u00b5a \u2212 1 L2 \u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u00b5C\u03c1a + 1 L2 \u2207\u0302c\u2207\u0302cC\u00b5a \u2212 1 L2 \u2207\u0302c\u2207\u0302aC\u00b5c + 1 h5\u03bb2 \u22072CY2C\u00b5a+ \u2212 2 L2 ( \u0302\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u2202 \u03bbV \u03bda \u2212 \u0302abc\u2202cV b\u00b5 ) = 0 . (6.13)\nTo diagonalise the coupled system (6.12)\u2013(6.13) we first pass to the modes V \u00b1\u00b5a = V\u00b5a \u00b1 C\u00b5a.\n1 L2 \u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u03c1V \u00b1\u00b5a \u2212 1 L2 \u2207\u0302\u03c1\u2207\u0302\u00b5V \u00b1\u03c1a + 1 L2 \u2207\u0302c\u2207\u0302cV \u00b1\u00b5a \u2212 1 L2 \u2207\u0302c\u2207\u0302aV \u00b1\u00b5c + 1 h5\u03bb2 \u22072CY2V \u00b1 \u00b5a\u2213 \u2213 2 L2 ( \u0302\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u2202 \u03bbV \u00b1\u03bda \u2212 \u0302abc\u2202cV \u00b1b\u00b5 ) = 0 . (6.14)\nThere is a complication in the above equations since the last terms couple different AdS3 components and different S3 components. However, the harmonic expansion brings the equations to the diagonal form through relations (6.3) and (6.5). Expanding\nV \u00b1\u00b5a = \u2211 \u2206,` R(\u2206,\u00b11)\u00b5 (x\u00b5)Y (`,\u00b11)a (ya)V \u00b1(\u00b1,\u00b1) \u2206,` (y i) , (6.15)\none obtains a set of equations for the unknown functions of the CY2 coordinates yi,\n1 h5\u03bb2 \u22072CY2V \u00b1(\u00b1,\u00b1) \u2206,`1 + (\u2206\u2212 1)2 L2 V \u00b1(\u00b1,\u00b1) \u2206,`1 \u2212 (`1 + 1)2 L2 V \u00b1(\u00b1,\u00b1) \u2206,`1 \u2213 2 L2 [\u2213(\u2206\u2212 1)\u2213 (`1 + 1)]V \u00b1(\u00b1,\u00b1)\u2206,`1 = 0 , (6.16)\nwhich determines the spectrum. Here the choice of the signs in the last term of the equation follows the order of the choice in the function V \u00b1(\u00b1,\u00b1)\u2206,`1 . The first choice of the sign is the choice of the mode V \u00b1\u00b5a of the vector perturbation of the metric and F3. The other two correspond to the choice of the left or the right mover sectors in SO(2,2) and SO(4) respectively. Equation (6.16) is of the same form as equation (5.11) derived for the spin two mode if we set\nM2L2 = \u2206(\u2206\u2212 2)\u2212 1\u2213 2 [\u2213(\u2206\u2212 1)\u2213 (`1 + 1)] , (6.17)\nso all that is said about the analysis of the spectrum of the spin two mode applies to the vector modes, modulo a constant shift, at least in the case of the background solution (2.10).\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nIt is then sufficient to restrict our discussion to the case of zero modes of CY2, which correspond to BPS states. For the R symmetry current the simple relation with the spin two mode is expected, because both modes enter the same short superconformal multiplet, so the linearized equations too should be related by a simple supersymmetric transformation [57, 65]. The R symmetry is associated with one of the SU(2) factors of SO(4), say the one labeled by j (as opposed to j\u0304). Hence we have to choose one of the signs of (`1 + 1) in the above equation to correspond to the SU(2) R current. Choosing V + mode with j \u2212 j\u0304 = 1 (choosing the first sign for (`1 + 1)) one obtains the zero mode relation\n(\u2206\u2212 1)2 \u2212 (`1 + 1)2 \u00b1 2(\u2206\u2212 1) + 2(`+ 1) = 0 . (6.18)\nThe first choice of the sign corresponds to \u2206 = `1 (we ignore the non-unitary solution \u2206 = \u2212`1). For the second choice of the sign, the solution is \u2206 = `1 + 2 (ignore \u2206 = \u2212`1 + 2).\nIf we choose j\u0304 \u2212 j = 1 then\n\u2206(\u2206\u2212 2)\u00b1 2(\u2206\u2212 1) = `1(`1 + 4) + 2 . (6.19)\nOne finds \u2206 = `1 + 2 for the first choice of the sign and \u2206 = `1 + 4 for the second. Again, we omit the non-unitary branches. The analysis for the V \u2212 mode duplicates the above spectrum, but exchanges the left-right sector assignment. The result is summarised in table 1. The pair of states with \u2206 = `1 should correspond to the left and right components of the conserved SU(2) R current (`1 = 1), which are the lowest components of the short spin two multiplet, and an associated tower of operators labeled by `1. There are also two pairs of \u2206 = `1 + 2 towers that can be either highest components of some short multiplets or intermediate components of long multiplets. There is also a pair of heavy \u2206 = `1 + 4 towers, which must belong to a long multiplet. In table 1 we label the states by the mode index V \u00b1, by the difference of conformal dimensions h\u2212 h\u0304 = \u00b11 (\u2206 = h+ h\u0304) and by the difference of S3 spins j \u2212 j\u0304 = \u00b11 (`1 = j + j\u0304).\n7 Comments on string theory for new N = (4, 0) AdS3 solutions\nIt is natural to ask if the supergravity solutions discussed in the present work have string theory completions, and whether one can learn something new about them from a worldsheet\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nconstruction. In this section, we make some comments regarding the question of which string theory would lead to the new N = (4, 0) AdS3 solutions presented in this paper. Well-known examples of superstrings on AdS3 are the type IIB on AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7M4, where M4 is either T4 or K3. These backgrounds are obtained by considering the near horizon limit of some branes. The new ingredients appearing in the supergravity solutions of this paper are additional extended objects: D-branes and O-planes (or their S-dual relatives, NS fivebranes and ONS5-planes18). Besides, the solutions have N = (4, 0) symmetry, and the reduction from N = (4, 4) to N = (4, 0) is a consequence of adding these extra sources. One can start considering the presence of O5-planes extended in the AdS3\u00d7S3 directions. In type IIB string theory, these objects appear as the fixed loci of elements of a group G = G1 \u00d7 \u2126wG2 acting on both the worldsheet and the target space [77]. Here, \u2126w is the parity transformation of the worldsheet which exchanges left- and right-moving sectors of closed strings; for instance, in type IIB superstring in a flat background, the graviton GMN , dilaton \u03c6, and R-R two-form CMN are all even under \u2126w, while the NS-NS two-form BMN , the axion C (R-R scalar), and R-R four-form with self-dual field strength CMNPQ, are odd under \u2126w. On the other hand, the groups G1 and G2 only act on the target space. These can be any discrete isometry of the space, where in particular the unique non-trivial element of G2 is taken to be an involution Z2 denoted by \u03c3. The orientifold is constructed by suitably projecting out states in the type IIB spectrum that are non-invariant under G, while adding, if necessary, extra states belonging to twisted sectors which are states that satisfy periodic boundary conditions up to conjugation of an element of G1. The fixed loci of the set of elements of G acting on the target space correspond to the position of extended objects. For example, if G contains only the element \u2126w, its action is trivial on the target space, thus its fixed locus is the entire target space: it will give rise to spacetime-filling O9-planes. These objects do not appear in the new supergravity solutions considered here; this means that the orientifold group should be of the form G1 \u00d7{1,\u2126w\u03c3}. Taking AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7M4 as target space, the aforementioned O5-planes arise when \u03c3 is an involution of M4, whose fixed locus is zero-dimensional. Locally, one can take\n\u03c3 : (y6, y7, y8, y9) 7\u2192 (\u2212y6,\u2212y7,\u2212y8,\u2212y9) . (7.1)\nThus if M4 = T4, then there are sixteen fixed points, that is, sixteen O5-planes extended in the AdS3\u00d7S3 directions and located at points (a6, . . . , a9) where ai = 0, or ai = \u03c0R (R being the radius of T4). In the limit R \u2192 \u221e, the torus is decompactified to R4 with the origin as the unique fixed point. For K3 as internal manifold, \u03c3 can be taken to be a holomorphic involution satisfying \u03c3\u2217\u21262 = \u21262, where the action of \u03c3\u2217 on the holomorphic two-form \u21262 on K3 has two \u22121 eigenvalues.19 Compact internal spaces M4 require, of course, the cancellation of the total RR charge as a consistency condition. The O-planes can carry RR charges and in many models it is necessary to add D-branes to ensure charge cancellation. For non-compact internal sector this constraint can in principle be relaxed.\n18In the rest of the paper, supergravity solutions with only RR 3-form flux are considered. It is of course simple to map these to pure NS solutions via S-duality. Nevertheless, the study of NS fivebranes differ from that of D-branes since only the latter can be analyzed perturbatively.\n19Several explicit examples are given in [78] for the case of K3 orbifolds.\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nSince the low energy limit of these models corresponds to supergravity theories on AdS3, we could follow a different path: instead of directly dealing with orientifolds of strings living in these backgrounds, we could analyze the string compactification to d = 6 before reducing to the AdS3 vacuum solution, and then perform the corresponding Kaluza-Klein compactification on S3. In the following, we briefly consider an orientifold of the torus compactification of type IIB superstring to d = 6. A torus compactification preserves all supersymmetry coming from the d = 10 theory. Here one has two supercharges Q\u03b1, Q\u0303\u03b1, \u03b1 = 1, . . . , 16, one from the left-moving and one from the right-moving sector, which are both ten-dimensional spinors of the same chirality [76]. These spinors decompose as\nQ\u03b1 \u2192 (QaA, QAa\u0307), Q\u0303\u03b1 \u2192 (Q\u0303aA, Q\u0303Aa\u0307) (7.2)\nwhere upper (lower) A = 1, . . . , 4 is an index for a chiral (antichiral) spinor of so(1, 5), while a (a\u0307) is a spinor index for the first (second) su(2) contained in so(4) \u2261 su(2)\u2295 su(2). Hence, the low energy field theory is N = (2, 2) d = 6 supergravity.\nBosonic d = 10 massless states of type IIB are:\n\u2022 NS-NS sector: GMN , BMN ,\u03a6.\n\u2022 R-R sector: C,CMN , CMNPQ.\nUnder the split M \u2192 (m, i), where m = 0, . . . , 5, i = 6, . . . , 9, and neglecting dependence on internal coordinates, one gets the field content in d = 6:\n\u2022 25 scalars: one dilaton \u03a6, sixteen moduli of T4 (ten from Gij and six from Bij), one axion C, b2 = 6 scalars from Cij , and one scalar Cijkl.\n\u2022 16 vectors: Gmi, Bmi, Cmi, Cmijk; each contributing 4 vectors.\n\u2022 5 antisymmetric tensors: one Bmn, one Cmn and three from Cmnij .\n\u2022 Metric: Gmn\nThis is precisely the bosonic field content of N = (2, 2) d = 6 supergravity. Now consider the orientifold of type IIB superstring on the torus T4 with orientifold\ngroup {1,\u2126w\u03c3}. The action of \u03c3 on the spin fields (of the RNS formalism) allows one to deduce [66]\n\u03c3QaA = \u2212QaA, \u03c3QAa\u0307 = QAa\u0307 (7.3)\nand similarly for the supercharges in the right-moving sector. This means that only QaA\u2212Q\u0303aA and QAa\u0307 + Q\u0303Aa\u0307 are left invariant by \u2126w\u03c3; the low energy field theory is N = (1, 1) d = 6 supergravity coupled to matter multiplets. To get the appropriate projection of massless states, notice that worldsheet supersymmetry requires that\n\u03c3\u03c8m = \u03c8m, \u03c3\u03c8i = \u2212\u03c8i , (7.4)\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nwith the analogous action on right-moving \u03c8\u0303M . Combining this with worldsheet parity reversal, one gets in the NS-NS sector:\n\u2126w\u03c3\u03a6 = \u03a6, \u2126w\u03c3Gij = Gij , \u2126w\u03c3Bmi = Bmi, \u2126w\u03c3Gmn = Gmn (7.5) \u2126w\u03c3Bij = \u2212Bij , \u2126w\u03c3Gmi = \u2212Gmi, \u2126w\u03c3Bmn = \u2212Bmn (7.6)\nThe projection in the R-R sector requires one to know the action of \u03c3 on the different components of the fermion vertex V\u03b1 = e\u2212\u03c6/2S\u03b1 (and V\u0303\u03b1 = e\u2212\u03c6\u0303/2S\u0303\u03b1). This was already given in (7.3); the left-moving supersymmetry charge is just the left-moving fermion vertex at zero momentum. Notice also that V\u03b1 and V\u0303\u03b1 anticommute.\nR-R states are obtained by tensoring V\u03b1 \u2297 V\u0303\u03b2 . The action of \u03c3 is\n\u03c3 VaAV\u0303bB = VaAV\u0303bB, \u03c3 VAa\u0307V\u0303Bb\u0307 = VAa\u0307V\u0303Bb\u0307, (7.7)\n\u03c3 VaAV\u0303Bb\u0307 = \u2212VaAV\u0303Bb\u0307, \u03c3 VAa\u0307V\u0303bB = \u2212VAa\u0307V\u0303bB. (7.8)\nFrom (linear combinations of) VaAV\u0303bB and VAa\u0307V\u0303Bb\u0307 one constructs the vertex operators of C,Cij , Cijkl, Cmn and Cmnij , while VaAV\u0303Bb\u0307 and VAa\u0307V\u0303bB give vertex operators of Cmi and Cmijk. Taking the action of \u2126w, one gets\n\u2126w\u03c3Cij = Cij , \u2126w\u03c3Cmijk = Cmijk, \u2126w\u03c3Cmn = Cmn, (7.9) \u2126w\u03c3C = \u2212C, \u2126w\u03c3Cijkl = \u2212Cijkl, \u2126w\u03c3Cmi = \u2212Cmi, \u2126w\u03c3Cmnij = \u2212Cmnij .\n(7.10)\nTherefore, the bosonic massless states of this orientifold of type IIB on T4 are\n\u2022 17 scalars: one dilaton \u03a6, ten scalars from Gij and six scalars from Cij .\n\u2022 8 vectors: Bmi and Cmijk; each contributing 4 vectors.\n\u2022 1 antisymmetric tensor: Cmn.\n\u2022 Metric: Gmn This matches the field content of N = (1, 1) d = 6 supergravity coupled to 4 vector multiplets. The states projected out from the type IIB parent theory are thus 8 scalars Bij , C and Cijkl, 8 vectors Gmi and Cmi, and four antisymmetric tensors Bmn and Cmnij . The spacetime fields corresponding to these states (together with their duals in d = 6) must be absent in the supergravity analysis and, in particular, in all the equations of motion. Notice that our orientifold projection does not kill Cmn, whose component C\u00b5a is crucial in order to get a consistent set of linearized equations as explained in section 6. If we now take the decompactification limit, a continuum appears in the massless spectrum due to the presence of internal momenta (corresponding massive states become massless while winding states acquire infinite mass). The theory would in principle become effectively ten-dimensional, although the projection sketched before is still valid. The question arises whether compactification induced by warping can lift this continuum and allow us to make contact with the R4 solutions presented in section 3. Notice that the case with a single O5-plane seems more naturally related to the R\u2192\u221e limit of the torus solution; the O5-O5 solution seems more complicated from the string perspective.\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0"

            "heading": "8 Conclusions",
            "text": "The results of this work consist of two main parts, the construction of new AdS3 solutions in type IIB supergravity that preserve small N = (4, 0) supersymmetry, and work towards the computation of the spectra of their dual CFT2s through the AdS-CFT correspondence. In the first part we consider a class of solutions, originally derived in [21] which generalise the D1-D5 near horizon solution (AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7CY2 preserving N = (4, 4)) in two ways: i) First there is an additional CY2 dependent warping consistent with co-dimension 4 sources ii) The 3-sphere becomes non trivially fibered over CY2 in terms of a connection A. These additions come at the cost of breaking supersymmetry to N = (4, 0), but have the benefit of no longer requiring that CY2 = T4 or K3 for the internal space to be bounded. We consider the case of CY2 = R4 in the most detail, constructing explicit solutions with non trivial A bounded between D5 and O5, O5 and O5 singularities as well as an intermediate case bounded between an O5 and a regular zero. In addition to this we show how to backreact D5 and O5 on AdS3\u00d7S3 \u00d7 T4, giving an explicit example with a single O5 plane. These examples non trivially generalise the D1-D5 near horizon providing new examples where the internal metric is explicitly known. Generalising out from this point we also establish how to construct solutions for generic CY2s that contain at least one U(1) isometry, with a view towards constructing solutions of more exotic Calabi-Yau manifolds in future. Finally we generalise the class of [21] to provide an uplift of all solutions of minimal d = 5 ungauged supergravity coupled to an Abelian vector multiplet. This provides new embeddings for (among other things) d = 5 black-hole and black-string solutions into type IIB supergravity, opening a new window into microstate counting a la Strominger-Vafa [74]. For string Phenomenological reasons it is of course interesting to consider the D1-D5 near horizon on K3. This is an example where Calabi-Yau manifolds are known to exist but no closed form (or even realistically tractable series) expressions for their metrics is known. Despite this much progress has been made over the years considering string theory on K3 in various contexts. A glaring omission from our work is the backreaction of sources on AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7K3. This should indeed be possible within the class of solution of [21], however the methods we employed to construct solutions required information about the metric on CY2 to construct the connection A. We have little doubt that with a more sophisticated approach the need to define a metric can be circumvented \u2014 we leave this interesting problem for future work. The main motivation behind the study of the above supergravity solutions is deriving new examples of the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. For the reasons explained in the introduction, this topic remains a subject of active research. So, in the second part of the work, we made a few steps towards the identification of possible dual CFT2. The main target of the present study was the superconformal multiplet containing the stress-energy tensor and the triplet R current. We identified the corresponding supergravity modes. In supergravity the R current mode appears mixed with a few other vector modes, for which we obtained the scaling dimensions of the dual CFT operators. The presence of the stress-tensor superconformal multiplet was guaranteed by supersymmetry, so the most interesting part about our results is the specific form of the equation\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nthat describes the R current mode. In the present analysis this equation was derived for the simplest representative of the family of supergravity backgrounds, but it is possible to generalise it to the whole family and beyond, making it similar to the equation describing the stress-energy tensor mode, which in turn is valid for a very large class of compactifications. We expect that the R current mode equation is valid for a large class of backgrounds with extended supersymmetry. Further details about this matter will appear in the future publication [75]. A somewhat unexpected behaviour was observed in the analysis of the non-BPS part of the spectrum, which is parallel for both the spin two and spin one sectors. We find that for some classes of backgrounds (D5-O5) the spectrum of non-BPS states is finite, bounded from above by a continuum of non-normalisable modes. This bound has a simple dependence on the compactification parameters, such as the number of D branes. In the simplest example of the background considered in section 2.1 there are no modes other than the BPS ones. We do not know the precise reasons for such a behaviour, but a possible explanation is the singularity of the background and breaking of the supergravity approximation close to the singular points. The analysis of this paper is only a first step towards the identification of the dual theories. A desirable direction would be the full string theory analysis of the discussed compactifications. Only a qualitative discussion of the string approach was given in this work in section 7. We hope to come back with more specific results in the future."

The algebra is\n[Lm,Ln] = (m\u2212n)Lm+n+ k 2m(m 2\u22121)\u03b4m+n,0, (B.1) [T im,T jn] = i ijkT km+n+ 1 2km\u03b4m+n,0\u03b4 ij , (B.2)\n{Gar ,Gbs}= {G\u0304ar , G\u0304bs}= 0, (B.3) {Gar , G\u0304bs}= 2\u03b4abLr+s\u22122(r\u2212s)\u03c3iabT ir+s+ 1 2k(4r 2\u22121)\u03b4r+s,0\u03b4ab, (B.4)\n[Lm,T in] =\u2212nT in+m, [Lm,Gar ] = ( m 2 \u2212r ) Gam+r, [Lm, G\u0304as ] = ( m 2 \u2212s ) G\u0304am+s,\n(B.5)\n[T im,Gar ] =\u2212 1 2\u03c3 i abG b m+r, [T im, G\u0304as ] = 1 2\u03c3 i\u2217 abG\u0304 b m+s, (B.6)\nwhere ijk is the totally antisymmetric tensor with 123 = 1 and \u03c3iab are the Pauli matrices. Notice that in a unitary representation k must be a non-zero positive integer [68]. One can find the algebra written in the OPE language in [69] so that Lm, T im, Gar , and G\u0304as , are the Fourier components of the energy-momentum tensor, the SU(2) current operators, and the supercharges, respectively.\nB.1.1 Long and short multiplets in the NS sector\nThe superconformal primary operators are defined as those which are annihilated by all positive Fourier modes and are eigenstates of the zero modes, that is,\nLn>0 |Oh,r\u3009 = Gar>0 |Oh,r\u3009 = G\u0304as>0 |Oh,r\u3009 = T im>0 |Oh,r\u3009 = 0, L0 |Oh,r\u3009 = h |Oh,r\u3009 , T i0 |Oh,r\u3009 = ti |Oh,r\u3009 . (B.7)\nThe global long-multiples are obtained by acting repeatedly with Ga\u22121/2 and G\u0304a\u22121/2 in |Oh,r\u3009 until they annihilate it. Schematically, the long multiplets Lr contain the set of operators of figure 4. It is possible to have all the multiplet components obeying the conformal primary condition L1 |Oh\u2032,r\u2032\u3009 = 0, by shifting some of them by a correction term, suitably changing the basis. All the corrections for any component of L0 and L1 can be found in [70]. Altogether, a long multiplet Lr>1 consists of a set of sixteen20 (quasi)conformal primary operators built from |Oh,r\u3009.\n20L0 has ten and L1 has fifteen operators.\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\n[r] 2[r], [r \u00b1 2] h+ 1\n[r] h\n[r \u00b1 1]\n[r] h+ 2\n[r \u00b1 1] h+ 32[r \u00b1 1]\n[r]\n[r \u00b1 1] h+ 12\nFigure 4. Schematic representation of the long-multiplet Lr, see [70] for more details. The arrows going to the left (right) represent the action of Ga\u2212 12 ( G\u0304b\u2212 12 ) . In the figure only the SU(2) indices are shown. Operators in the same line have the same conformal dimension h and the dimension grows by half when moving to the next line above.\nImposing unitarity we obtain\n\u3008Oh,r| {Ga1 2 , G\u0304b\u2212 12 } |Oh,r\u3009 = \u3008Oh,r| 2\u03b4abL0 \u2212 2\u03c3iabT i0 |Oh,r\u3009 = 2 ( h\u2212 r2 ) \u2265 0. (B.8)\nThe equality h = r/2 saturating the lower bound in (B.8) is called the shortening condition (SC). One calls a short multiplet the set of states consisting of the bottom component, which is a superconformal primary |Oh,r\u3009 obeying SC, and its decedents. We will denote the short multiplets by Ar. The shortening condition for h = r = 0 is obeyed if h = 0. The vacuum is the only state with h = 0, and the correspondent operator is the identity. Furthermore, in this case the identity is the only superconformal primary operator, then A0 = {1}. In order to construct A1 we have to start from a state which has h = 1/2 to satisfy the SC. One can see that we can only construct two other operators with lower dimension SU(2) representations, therefore\nA1 = {|O 1 2 , 1 2 \u3009, G\u2212 12 |O 12 , 12 \u3009, G\u0304\u2212 12 |O 12 , 12 \u3009} . (B.9)\nFor r > 1 we obtain Ar = { |O r\n2 ,r \u3009, |O r+1 2 ,r\u22121 \u3009, |O r+1 2 ,r\u22121 \u3009, |O r+1 2 ,r\u22122 \u3009 } , (B.10)\nwhere |Or/2,r\u3009 is a superconformal primary operator. It is easy to see that each small internal diamond in figure 4 forms a short multiplet when we impose the SC for their bottom component. The long multiplets Lr can be decomposed in a direct sum of short multiplets. Any superconformal theory has a short multiplet containing the stress-energy tensor, which is nothing but a generator of the superconformal algebra. The latter should commute with Ga\u2212 12 and G\u0304a\u2212 12 , so we expect that it to be the top component of the multiplet. In particular, any short multiplet with bottom component [r = 2] has a top component with (h, r) = (2, 0). In the case of the stress-energy tensor the lowest component of the short superconformal multiplet is the SU(2) R current operator with (h, r) = (1, 2). The gravity mode corresponding to the latter operator was identified in section 6.\n\u2013 39 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nB.1.2 The R sector\nAs it was said before, in the R sector the indices r and s of the fermionic operators assume integer values. In this section we will denote the highest-weight states by |O\u2032h,r\u3009, with r being the T 30 eigenvalue [71]:\nLn>0 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = Gam>0 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = G\u0304am>0 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = T ia>0 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = 0, (B.11)\nG20 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = G\u030410 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = T+0 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = 0, L0 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = h |O\u2032h,r\u3009 , T 30 |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = r |O\u2032h,r\u3009 , (B.12)\nwhere T\u00b1m = T 1m + iT 2m. One can see that the operators G20 and G\u030410 increase r. This time, the shortening condition is derived from the zero G modes\n\u3008O\u2032h,r| {Ga0, G\u0304b0} |O\u2032h,r\u3009 = \u03b4ab (\n2h\u2212 k2\n) \u2265 0. (B.13)\nWe call massless and massive representations the two cases massless : h = k 4 , r = 0, 1 2 , 1, . . . , k 2 ,\nmassive : h > k4 , r = 1 2 , 1, 3 2 , . . . , k 2 .\n(B.14)\nWe saw that in the NS sector long multiplets can be written in terms of short multiplets, similarly, massive irreducible representation can be express in terms of massless irreducible ones [68]. Considering the algebra of the zero modes, one can verify that G\u030410 and G20 increase r by 1/2, while G10 and G\u030420 decrease r by the same value. Also, T+0 increases r by 1 and T\u22120 decreases r by 1. We define A1 as the state with the maximum T 30 eigenvalue in the representation, T 30A1 = RA1, then G20A1 = G\u030410A1 = T+0 A1 = 0. In addition, L0A1 = HA1. We define B1 = G10A1, B\u03041 = G\u030420A1, and the operators\nw0 = (T+\u22121)k\u22122l+1, w1 = (T+0 )2l\u22121 [ G\u030420G 1 0 \u2212 1 l ( H \u2212 k4 ) T\u22120 ] . (B.15)\nThen, starting from A1 we construct the full global supermultiplet in the massive21 representation by applying alternately w0 and w1 in A1 (see \u03b1- and \u03b2-series in [71]). The resulting supermultiplet is composed by the following states\n1. A1 A2, A3, . . . , A2R+1.\n2. B1, . . . , B2R.\n3. B\u03041, . . . , B\u03042R. 4. C1 = G\u030420G10A1 \u2212 12R ( 2H \u2212 k2 ) T\u22120 A1, . . . , C2R\u22121.\nIt is important to note that in the massless representation the highest-weight states are annihilated not only by G\u030410 and G20, but also by G10 and G\u030420, what means that in such representation either all states are bosonic or all of them are fermionic depending on the grade of A1.\n21In the massless representation we exchange w1 by w1 = (T+0 )2l\u22121.\n\u2013 40 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nB.2 The large N = 4 superconformal algebra\nIn the previous section we constructed the supermultiplets of the small N = 4 superconformal algebra. For some of the backgrounds discussed in this work, such as AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7S3 \u00d7 R preserve the large N = 4 superconformal algebra, which is defined by\n[Lm, Ln] = (m\u2212 n)Lm+n + c 12(m 3 \u2212m)\u03b4m+n,0, (B.16) [Um, Un] = k+ + k\u2212\n2 m\u03b4m,\u2212n, (B.17)\n[A\u00b1,im , A\u00b1,jn ] = k\u00b1\n2 m\u03b4 ij\u03b4m,\u2212n + i ijlA\u00b1,lm+n, (B.18)\n{Qar , Qbs} = k+ + k\u2212\n2 \u03b4 ab\u03b4r,\u2212s, (B.19)\n{Gar , Gbs} = c\n3 ( r2 \u2212 14 ) \u03b4ab\u03b4r,\u2212s + 2\u03b4abLr+s + 4(r \u2212 s) [ \u03b3i\u03b1+iabA +,i r+s + (1\u2212 \u03b3)i\u03b1\u2212iabA \u2212,i r+s ] ,\n(B.20) [Lm, Vn] = [(h(V )\u2212 1)m\u2212 n]Vm+n, (B.21) [Um, Gar ] = mQam+r (B.22) [Um, A\u00b1,in ] = [Um, Qar ] = 0, (B.23) [A\u00b1,im , Qar ] = i\u03b1\u00b1iabQ b m+r, (B.24)\n[A\u00b1,im , Gar ] = i\u03b1\u00b1iabG b m+r \u2213 2k\u00b1 k+ + k\u2212m\u03b1 \u00b1i abQ b m+r, (B.25)\n{Qar , Gbs} = 2\u03b1+iabA +,i r+s \u2212 2\u03b1\u2212iabA \u2212,i r+s + \u03b4abUr+s, (B.26)\nwhere\n\u03b3 = k \u2212 k , c = 6k +k\u2212 k , k = k+ + k\u2212, (B.27)\nand in (B.21) Vn is either U , A\u00b1,i, Qa, or Ga, and h is its respective conformal weight (h[U ] = 1, h[A\u00b1,i] = 1, h[Qa] = 12 , and h[Ga] = 3 2 [72]). In a unitary representation, both k+ and k\u2212 are positive integers [63]. The matrices \u03b1\u00b1iab are the so(4) matrix representations of the generators\n\u03b1\u00b1iab = 1 2 (\u00b1\u03b4ia\u03b4b0 \u2213 \u03b4ib\u03b4a0 + iab) , (B.28)\nand they obey\n[\u03b1\u00b1i, \u03b1\u00b1j ] = \u2212 ijl\u03b1\u00b1l, [\u03b1+i, \u03b1\u2212j ] = 0, {\u03b1\u00b1i, \u03b1\u00b1j} = \u221212\u03b4 ij . (B.29)\nThe indices a and b run from 0 to 3, i, j, l run from 1 to 3, m,n \u2208 Z, r, s \u2208 Z in the R sector and r, s \u2208 12Z in the NS sector. Together the generators L0, L\u00b11, Ga\u00b1 12\n, and A\u00b1,i0 form the global superalgebra D(2, 1|\u03b1) [72].\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 6 0\nWe will denote the highest-weight states by |h, l+, l\u2212, u\u3009, where h and u are the L0 and U0 eigenvalues, respectively, while l\u00b1 are the su(2) spins22 [63, 72]:\n\u2212(A+iA+i)0 |h, l+, l\u2212, u\u3009 = l+(l+ + 1) |h, l+, l\u2212, u\u3009 , (B.30) \u2212(A\u2212iA\u2212i)0 |h, l+, l\u2212, u\u3009 = l\u2212(l\u2212 + 1) |h, l+, l\u2212, u\u3009 . (B.31)\nThey are annihilated by all the positive modes and by A\u00b1+0 . The spins l\u00b1 can assume the values\nl\u00b1 = 0, 12 , 1, . . . , 1 2(k \u00b1 \u2212 1), (B.32)\nthat is, the unitarity bound is given by\nl\u00b1 \u2264 12(k \u00b1 \u2212 1). (B.33)\nMoreover, it is possible to show that the BPS bound is given by\nh \u2265 1 k+ + k\u2212 [k+j\u2212 + k\u2212j+ + u2 + (j+ \u2212 j\u2212)2] . (B.34)\nOnce that a representation in the NS sector is constructed, one automatically has a representation in the R sector thanks to the equivalence [63]\n(h, l+, l\u2212, u)NS \u2261 ( h\u2212 l+ + k \u2212\n4 , l +, k\u2212 2 \u2212 l \u2212, u ) R .
