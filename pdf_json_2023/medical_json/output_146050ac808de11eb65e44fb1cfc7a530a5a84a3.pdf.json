    "abstractText": "Safety of the observation window is one of the core concerns for manned submersibles. When subjected to underwater static pressure, extrusion and creep deformation always occur in the observation window, which can pose a threat to both safety and optical performance. To assess the deformation, real-time and non-contact monitoring methods are necessary. In this study, a conceptual setup based on the waveplate rotation and dual-DoFP (division of focal-plane polarimeter) polarization camera is built for the observation window\u2019s creep monitoring by measuring the Mueller matrix images of the samples under different pressures and durations. Then, a series of characteristic parameters, such as t1, R, r, R\u2032, are extracted from the Muller matrix images by Mueller matrix transformation (MMT), Mueller matrix polar decomposition (MMPD), correlation analysis and phase unwrapping method. The results demonstrate that these parameters can effectively describe the observation window\u2019s creep at different pressure levels which are simulated by finite element analysis. Additionally, more characterization parameters, such as \u03c8, A and D, are given from the Mueller matrix images and discussed to illustrate the method\u2019s potential for further applications and investigations. Ultimately, future devices based on this method could serve as a valuable tool for real-time and non-contact creep monitoring of the submersible observation windows.",

            "text": "The observation windows play a vital role in enabling manned submersibles to observe the external environment, and the windows\u2019 structural integrity and reliability are crucial factors in determining the submersible\u2019s safety. Typically, major observation windows are made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) material [1] which exhibits nonlinear viscoelastic properties [2] when it works at sea temperature [3] (\u22122 \u25e6C to 30 \u25e6C [4]). When the material is subjected to a certain constant external force, this macroscopically manifests as the continuous deformation (including the internal structure and surface) over time, which is terminologically called creep [5]. Microscopically when the material is pressurized, its internal polycrystalline structure along different angles will rotate in the direction of the applied force and present an orientation distribution [6]. This means that the molecules are re-aligned and the spacing between crystals increases [7], which is always described as the stress birefringence in optics. Therefore, for the observation windows made of this material, the creep will definitely occur when the submersibles dive in the deep sea, which would potentially affect the safety performance of the observation window [8] and alter its optical properties [9]. Therefore, it is necessary to measure and monitor the observation window\u2019s creep of the submersible working in the deep sea.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4733. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16134733 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4733 2 of 18\nOver the last decades, research has been conducted to monitor the observation windows\u2019 creep, such as the works of Liu et al. [8] and Wang et al. [10], who used the strain gauges or the displacement sensors to trace the surface deformation of the windows. These methods are limited to the surface and subjected to the possible damage of the window, and only the creep strain on the window\u2019s surface can be measured. Most researchers prefer to use the numerical modeling [11\u201313] to simulate and analyze the observation windows\u2019 creep, including the internal stress and deformation. However, they cannot predict the actual operation of submersibles, nor can they respond to unexpected situations underwater. Thus, it is imperative to develop a real-time, non-contact method for dynamically monitoring of the observation windows\u2019 creep. Polarization is a critical property of light, and changes in its states can reflect sample\u2019s microscopic physical structures at subwavelength levels [14]. The Stokes vector is commonly used to describe the state of polarized light, denoted as S = [I, Q, U, V]T . When light passes through a sample, the initial Stokes vector, Sin, and the output Stokes vector, Sout, can be connected using a 4 \u00d7 4 Mueller matrix M that contains the sample\u2019s polarization properties. The relationship between them is expressed as Equation (1) [15],\nSin =  Iin\nQin Uin Vin\n, Sout =  Iout Qout\nUout Vout\n, M = \nm11 m12 m13 m14 m21 m22 m23 m24 m31 m32 m33 m34 m41 m42 m43 m44 , Sout = M\u00d7 Sin. (1) In recent studies, researchers have utilized the polarized light imaging methods to\ncharacterize the optical birefringence and further analyze the stress and strain inside transparent samples like the observation windows of the submersibles. Ajovalasit et al. used the phase-shifting method to measure the residual stress of a glass sheet with a thickness of 8 mm based on photoelasticity [16]. Almeida et al. proposed a phase-shifting technique with phase-step and analyzed the stress of the annular disk under diametric compression [17]. Zhang et al. measured the stress birefringence distribution curve of flat glass by rotating a polarization detector based on polarization interferometric method [18]. Gao et al. used a polarized camera to achieve a four-step phase shift and obtained headlight lens\u2019 stress retardation and direction images derived from Stokes matrix and Mueller matrix [19]. However, these methods rely on stress birefringence that requires a thin sample to assume a constant thickness, which is not ideal for the submersible observation windows that are typically thick enough to withstand underwater pressure. Li et al. measured the Mueller matrix of a conical observation window and characterized the stress changes during loading and unloading using specific polarization parameters [20], but she did not consider the window\u2019s creep when a constant pressure was exerted on it. Moreover, the creep monitoring requires more attention to the balance between parameters\u2019 sensitivity and robustness than the experiments in the pressurization since the material changes during the creep are temporally continuous but imperceptible. Despite these efforts, monitoring the observation window\u2019s creep using polarized light techniques remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a Mueller matrix imaging method to monitor the creep of scaled-down samples of observation windows, which enables a real-time, non-contact monitoring of the samples and could help enhance the submersible\u2019s safety in the future. A pressurization device based on a jack is constructed to exert the pressure on the sample and last for 360 min. An experimental setup is built to continuously measure the sample\u2019s Muller matrix images during the creep under different pressures. After that, some polarization parameters and the correlation coefficient derived from Mueller matrix images are shown to characterize the sample\u2019s creep under different pressures. The finite element analysis is used to verify the reliability of the above characteristic parameters. Furthermore, additional polarization parameters are given and discussed to further understand the creep and physical properties of the sample. Our work suggests a real-time and non-contact polarized imaging technique to monitor the observation window\u2019s creep, which has the po-\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4733 3 of 18\ntential to contribute to the characterization of creep behavior of some transparent materials like PMMA."

The PSG generates a series of incident polarization states, each of which is measured by the polarimeter to ensure the accuracy of Sin. After that, the light beam with known Sin directly illuminates the PSA. Note that the four polarization states in [Sin]4\u00d7n are not included. Then, the so-called instrument matrix of PSA is obtained to transfer pixel values of the dual-DoFP camera to the Stokes vector of the illumination light. Finally, we evaluate the setup\u2019s measurement error of the Mueller matrix. We use the air as the standard sample whose Mueller matrix is the unit matrix. For the measured 4 \u00d7 4 Mueller matrix images, the mean value of each element image is first obtained, and then a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix consisting of these mean values is obtained. The measurement error is the maximum of the absolute error between the elements of this 4 \u00d7 4 matrix and unit matrix, which is less than 0.01 for the current setup. The deformation and deviation of the sample after pressurization can distort the corresponding image pixels of the incident and outgoing light, leading to inaccuracies in the Mueller matrix measurement. In order to address this image distortion, we used projection transformation to recover the deformed image to its original form [20]."

For each polarization parameter image, we use the radius of the minimal circle covering the clear area to represent the size of the clear area. Figure 6a collects the size of the clear area with different pressures and creep times. Obviously, the size of the clear area decreases with increasing pressure. The sizes of the clear area at 60 MPa change least as the creep time increases, and those at 90 MPa change slightly, but those at 120 MPa change significantly and those at 150 MPa change most. Finally, the clear area reaches its minimum size at the last creep time. Note that the sizes of the clear area after the pressurization are not consistent with the pressures, due to differences among individual samples.

Obviously, large pressure can cause significant creep of the sample. In addition, one notices that during the creep, the correlation coefficients at 120 MPa are similar with those at 90 MPa. However, as shown in the inset of Figure 6b, the correlation coefficients at 120 MPa decline faster than those at 90 MPa, which is consistent with the expectation that higher pressure would lead to more serious creep [33]. However, the differences between the samples discussed later should be taken into account when considering the practical usage of these polarization parameters. In conclusion, the findings discussed above are consistent with the creep law of PMMA materials [38], representing that the correlation coefficient of polarization images has the potential to serve as an indicator of the overall creep of an observation window under constant pressure. When the sample is subjected to an upward load, it is squeezed and deformed with the window seat, and subsequently, a deviation occurs between them.

As seen from these figures, the upward extrusion of the latter surface increases with time and pressure. Notably, the center of the latter surface looks relatively flat, and the edge looks steep. This steep edge greatly deflects the propagation path of light, thereby increasing the numerical aperture (NA) of the observation windows. If the NA is so large that the light cannot be received by PSA whose NA is fixed, the edge areas of the latter surface would not be effectively imaged by the cameras, resulting in blurry images as seen in t1 and R images of Section 3.1. Moreover, in Figures 3 and 4, larger blurred areas are observed for higher pressure or the longer creep times, which is consistent with the steeper edges shown in Figure 9a\u2013d.\nFigure 8. Finite ele ent a al sis res lts f ser ti i er 0 a ressure: (a) VonMises stress nephogram with t = 360 min, (b) strain nephogram with t = 0 s, (c) strain nephogram with t = 360 min, (d) equivalent creep strain nephogram with t = 1 min, (e) equivalent creep strain nephogram with t = 360 min.\nThe total deformation at the initial stage (t = 0 min) of creep and after 360 min creep are, respectively, shown as Figure 8b,c. After the creep, the total deformation of the observation window becomes noticeable. The latter surface extrudes upwards, and its total deformation close to the central axis reaches the maximum. This corresponds to the shrinkage of the clear area observed in t1 and R images shown in Section 3.1. The equivalent creep strain distribution nephograms of the observation window for t = 1 min and for t = 360 min are shown in Figure 8d,e, respectively. The areas near the latter surface are selected to enlarge as the inserted images. From these two inserted images, one can see that the strain concentration of the latter surface spreads from the maximal point of the stress in Figure 8a, to the center area over time, which is consistent with the polarization parameter images in Section 3.1. For instance, the red edges of the t1 images gradually spread towards the center in Figure 3, and the curvature of the crimson ring in the R images increases over time in Figure 4. In addition, from Figure 8d,e, the creep effect makes the strain delamination of the observation window more serious. Creep simulations are carried out by subjecting the observation window to different pressures of 60 MPa, 90 MPa, 120 MPa, and 150 MPa for 360 min. Figure 9a\u2013d shows the total deformation of the latter surface changes as the creep time increases under the different pressures.

From Figures 9 and 10, one can see that both the deformation and equivalent creep strain at 90 MPa look less serious than those at 120 MPa. The mismatching between the experiments and the simulations may be due to the fact of the difference between the samples. It should be noted that the experiments were conducted independently using different samples. Moreover, as seen in Figure 6a, the selected radii at 90 MPa are larger than those both at 120 MPa and at 60 MPa, which indicates that the difference between the samples are not neglected. Still, the declining of the correlation coefficients in Figure 6b for all pressures can be explained by the temporal successive deformation and average equivalent creep strain shown in Figures 9 and 10. Overall, the finite element analysis results show the deformation of the observation window under the pressure and the stress-strain transfer processes inside it during creep. These results offer valuable insights into the characterization capability of the Mueller matrix images for the creep in the scaled-down samples."

One such parameter is the optical rotation angle \u03c8, which is calculated using Equation (9). Figure 11a,b shows the corresponding images and the mean values with the creep times, respectively. The \u03c8 images more prominently show the crimson ring than R images. The mean value tends to change in the opposite direction for the high pressure of 150 MPa compared to the other three lower pressures, suggesting the existence of some critical value for the sample property transition below 150 MPa. The anisotropy parameter A after normalization of the t1 combined with the b, is calculated by Equations (4), (10) and (11) [41]. Figure 11c shows the A images at different pressures for t = 0 min and t = 360 min. The A mean values as the creep time are shown in Figure 11d. As the creep time increases, the mean values at 120 MPa and 150 MPa change contrarily to those at 60 MPa and 90 MPa, which may imply that A is more sensitive to the sample\u2019s properties than \u03c8. There is also a noticeable spike in the early stage of the creep at 150 MPa, as shown in the inserted image in Figure 11d, which may be linked to the high pressure causing abrupt changes in the sample\u2019s performance [42]. D is the transposed asymmetric parameter of the Mueller matrix, and it is calculated using Equation (12). The corresponding images and their standard deviations versus the creep time are shown in Figure 11e,f, respectively. The standard deviation is correlated with the pressure, which lets D win out the other parameter mentioned above. According to Ref. [43], nonzero values of D indicate the presence of a layer-like structure in the sample. Therefore, this can be seen in Figure 11e, where the nonzero pixel values signify the existence of multiple layers in the sample, which can be supported by the complex layered structure from the simulation results presented in Figure 8.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4733 14 of 18\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 19 still need to be deeply mined or carefully combined to monitor the observation windows\u2019 creep.\nFrom the experimental results, it is observed that the changes of these characteristic parameters for the different pressures are much larger than those during the creep, which means that the creep monitoring needs more sensitive parameters to character its temporal changes. Additionally, since the creep will last for a relatively long time, it requires the parameters more sensitive to the creep but insensitive to the ambient factors than those in the pressurization. Therefore, the creep monitoring in this work is intrinsically different and more challenging than the previous research in Ref. [20], although it benefits from the latter."

Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 6b, when we fix the area size to be the minimal clear area of t1 images, the correlation coefficient of the temporal image with the reference (original) image decreases with the creep time, which means the image pattern gradually deviates from the original image. From Figure 6, one can see that the image features of the polarization parameters, including the geometry or the texture, would also be the effective clues to characterize the window creep. Future work would include this part when applying the proposed method to the in-situ monitoring of the window creep. During the creep, the clear areas in polarization parameter images gradually shrink while the blurred areas gradually expand. Only the central part of the clear areas is selected to analyze in this work, but the other parts are ignored. However, from the simulations, we know that the maximal point of the stress is located at the edge area of the sample which coincides with the blurred areas in the images. By increasing the NA of PSA, it may be possible to expand the clear areas. Furthermore, more advanced and sophisticated optical systems, such as through the application of zoom lens [44] and adaptive optics [45], are required to be adopted to improve the imaging quality and make the blurred areas image clearly. Moreover, the polarization imaging can be combined with the other imaging methods such as the spatial frequency domain imaging [46,47] to obtain the internal stress distributions of windows during the creep. Experimental results in Figures 3\u20136 and 11, show that the temporal changes of the polarization parameters have a strong correlation with the classical creep description. For example, as the time increases, the proposed characteristic parameters change rapidly at the early stage and then change slowly at the latter stage, which is quite similar with the primary creep and steady-state creep described in Ref. [21]. FEA is well known and believed to be a powerful tool to study the geometric deformation and stress distribution during the creep. The FEA simulations build the logic relationship between the creep and the characteristic parameters by explaining the optical effects in physical origin. For example, the deformation in Figure 9 deflects the propagation direction of the light, and the internal stress distribution results in the birefringence inside the window. All these optical effects can be characterized by the characteristic parameters including the radius of the clear area, and polarization parameters, such as R\u2032, t1, \u03c8, A, D, etc. These indicate that the characteristic parameters physically describe the changes of the windows during the creep, which ensures the effective monitoring. The method proposed in this paper still does not explicitly build a direct or empirical relationship between polarization parameters and physical parameters like stress and strain. However, since the Mueller matrix encapsulates the total polarization properties of the sample, the sophisticated design of the polarization parameters would be included in the future work. For example, deep learning and machine learning are applied to this optical process [48]. Polarization parameters can be fused and simplified into one or more visual parameters (such as refractive index, stress and strain) so as to determine whether there is a safety problem in the window at this moment and predict the state of the next period. This study aims to monitor the creep deformation of the submersible window, and a series of images and parameters with characterization capabilities are obtained. However, the current experimental method involves using a jack to pressurize a scaled-down sample in the air, which is still significantly different from the real underwater environment. In the future, it might be feasible to design an in-situ device that can monitor the creep of the submersible observation window working in the deep sea."
