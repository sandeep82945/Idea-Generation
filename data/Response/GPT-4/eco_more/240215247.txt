Development of Trustworthy Third-Party Evaluation Mechanisms: Investigate mechanisms for involving a neutral third party to validate the performance gains reported by task parties during the bargaining process. This could involve cryptographic techniques or blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the performance gains without compromising privacy.

Automated Bargaining Strategies Using AI: Explore the development of intelligent bargaining agents that can automatically generate offers based on learning algorithms. These agents could adaptively learn from past bargaining rounds to optimize their strategies for future negotiations, potentially improving efficiency and outcomes for both parties.

Extension to Multi-Party Bargaining Frameworks: While the current study focuses on a one-on-one bargaining scenario between a task party and a data party, future research could extend this framework to include multiple data parties. This extension would address scenarios where a task party may need to negotiate with several data providers to acquire complementary datasets, making the bargaining process more complex and dynamic.

Security and Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms: Further investigate and develop security and privacy-preserving mechanisms that can be integrated into the bargaining process. This includes exploring advanced cryptographic methods such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and differential privacy to protect the participants' sensitive information during the bargaining and data exchange phases.

Economic Models for Data Valuation in Federated Learning: Develop comprehensive economic models for valuing data in federated learning settings, taking into account factors such as data uniqueness, quality, and the potential revenue it can generate. These models would help in creating more nuanced and fair pricing strategies for data in VFL markets, benefiting both data providers and consumers.
