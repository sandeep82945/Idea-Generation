    "abstractText": "We systematically investigate the speed of sound in QCD matter under different conditions in the grand canonical ensemble within the Polyakov loop improved Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The numerical results indicate that the dependence of speed of sound on parameters like temperature and chemical potential can be indicative of QCD phase transition. Some new features of speed of sound are discovered, for instance, the hierarchy of sound velocity for u\u00f0d\u00de and s quark at low temperature with the increasing chemical potential and the squared sound velocity approaching to almost zero in the critical region. We also formulate the relations between differently defined sound velocity using the fundamental thermodynamic relations. Some conclusions derived are useful for hydrodynamics simulation and calculation of transport coefficient of bulk viscosity.",

INTRODUCTION\nHeavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies can create strongly interacting hot and/or dense matter. The exploration of QCD phase structure and search for phase transition signatures are significant goals in both theory and heavyion collision experiments. The calculations from first principle lattice QCD (LQCD) indicate that the transformation from quark-gluon plasma (QGP) to hadrons is a smooth crossover [1\u20138] at high temperature and small baryon chemical potential. A first-order phase transition, with a critical endpoint (CEP) connecting with a crossover transformation, is predicted at large chemical potential by quark models which share the symmetry properties of QCD, Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) and functional renormalization group (FRG) approaches (e.g., [9\u201320]). Some possible phase transition signals for such a phase\nstructure were proposed based on the ratios of net-baryon number cumulants [21]. The cumulants of net proton (proxy for baryon) have been measured in the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) experiments at RHIC STAR, and a non-monotonic energy dependence of the net-proton number kurtosis \u03ba\u03c32 was discovered [22\u201325]. It possibly hints that the STAR experiments with smaller colliding energy\npass through the QCD critical region. More accurate measurement on BES-II and the relevant experimental projects at NICA/FAIR/J-PARC/HIAF in the near future will provide us more information about the QCD phase diagram. The hydrodynamics simulation provides another scheme\nto explore the QCD phase transition. The space-time evolution of QCD matter can be successfully described using the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics [26\u201328]. One of the most important quantities in hydrodynamics is the speed of sound cs and its dependence on environment (temperature, density, chemical potential, etc.) [29]. In heavy-ion collision experiments, the sound velocity is a thermodynamic observable and carries important information in describing the evolution of the fireball. The study in [30\u201333] shows that c2s as a function of charged particle multiplicity hdNch=d\u03b7i can reveal the dynamics of heavyion collision. Recently, in [34] the authors estimate cs as a function of the logarithmic derivative with respect to the baryon density of QCD matter, and try to build a connection with the baryon number cumulants to aid in detecting the QCD critical endpoint. Besides heavy-ion collision experiments, the speed of\nsound is of particular interest to neutron star research (e.g., [35\u201337]). The behavior of cs as a function of density influences the mass-radius relation, the tidal deformability, and provides a sensitive probe of the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star matter. To obtain neutron stars with masses above two solar masses, several studies find that it is essential for the nuclear EOS to have a region in which the EOS is very stiff, where the sound velocity square is significantly larger than 1=3 [38\u201344].

It is also an interesting topic to study cs during the QCD phase transition in the early universe by observing the induced gravitational wave. Although the propagation of gravitational wave is insensitive to cs, the sound speed value affects the dynamics of primordial density perturbations, and the induced gravitational waves by their horizon reentry can then be an indirect probe on both the EOS and sound velocity, which can provide useful knowledge of the evolution in the era of QCD phase transition [46]. It can be seen from the above the speed of sound is a fundamental property of strongly interacting matter. Some calculations of sound velocity in QCD matter have been performed in LQCD [1,5,7,8,47], (P)NJL model [28,48\u201352], quark-meson coupling model [15,53], hadron resonance gas (HRG) model [54,55], field correlator method (FCM) [56,57] and quasiparticle model [58]. By far, the main focus is put on the region of high temperature and zero or small chemical potential. There is a crucial lack of cs in the full phase diagram and its relation with QCD phase transitions, including both the chiral and deconfinement transition. On the other hand, different definitions or even different statistical ensembles are taken to calculate the speed of sound in literature (e.g., [8,28,49\u201353]). Some issues with respect to thermodynamic relations need to be clarified. In this work, we give an intensive study on the sound velocity in QCD matter in the full phase diagram with different definitions of cs in the grand canonical ensemble. The numerical results indicate that the dependence of cs on the system parameters like temperature and/or chemical potential can be indicative of QCD phase transition. Some new features of speed of sound are also discovered for the first time, for example, the hierarchy phenomenon of sound velocity for u\u00f0d\u00de and s quark at low temperature with the increasing chemical potential and the squared sound velocity at the CEP approaching to almost zero. We also formulate the relations between differently defined cs using the fundamental thermodynamic relations, and derive some conclusions useful for hydrodynamics simulation. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the thermodynamic relations about the speed of sound for a thermal system, and then give a brief introduction to the 2\u00fe 1 flavor PNJL quark model. In Sec. III, we show the numerical results of speed of sound, and discuss the relations under different definitions, as well as the indicative signals of QCD phase transition. A summary is finally given in Sec. IV."

            "text": "The speed of sound is a fundamental properties of any substance. The definition of speed of sound requires\nspecifying a quantity constant during the propagation of the compression wave through a medium. The square of speed of sound is usually defined as\nc2x \u00bc \u2202p \u2202\u03f5 x ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere p and \u03f5 are pressure and energy density, respectively, and x denotes the parameter fixed in the calculation of the sound velocity. For a fireball created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,\nit evolves with constant entropy density per baryon s=\u03c1B in the ideal fluid, where s is the entropy density and \u03c1B is the baryon number density. This conclusion can be derived in hydrodynamics due to the conservations of energy and baryon number, therefore it is meaningful to calculate the sound velocity along the isentropic curve\nc2s=\u03c1B \u00bc \u2202p \u2202\u03f5\ns=\u03c1B\n: \u00f02\u00de\nThe dependence of c2s=\u03c1B on parameters like temperature and chemical potential can indicate the change of sound velocity during the evolution and provide important information of interaction and the equation of state of medium. There are also two other definitions of speed of sound\nwith constant entropy density or baryon number density usually used in the intermediate process of hydrodynamic evolution [28],\nc2s \u00bc \u2202p \u2202\u03f5\ns\nand c2\u03c1B \u00bc \u2202p \u2202\u03f5\n\u03c1B\n: \u00f03\u00de\nTo calculate the square of speed of sound under different definitions, it is necessary to derive the corresponding formulas as functions of T and \u03bcB from the fundamental thermodynamic relations.

            "text": "The value of c2s=\u03c1B at constant s=\u03c1B can reveal the speed of sound in the ideal hydrodynamic evolution. In Fig. 2, we plot the curves of c2s=\u03c1B as functions of temperature along the paths with s=\u03c1B \u00bc 100, 50, 20, 10, as shown in Fig. 1. It shows that, at the high-temperature side, c2s=\u03c1B approaches to 1=3, the value of ideal gas. The c2s=\u03c1B decreases in the evolution with the decrease of temperature. A rapid decrease occurs in the chiral crossover region, and there exists a minimum for each s=\u03c1B.\nTo indicate the relation between the speed of sound and the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions, we plot in Fig. 3 the values of c2s=\u03c1B , the scaled chiral condensate \u03d5=\u03d50 of u\u00f0d\u00de quark, and \u03a6 as functions of temperature with four given baryon chemical potentials \u03bcB \u00bc 0, 300, 600, 900 MeV. We also present in Fig. 4 the full contour map of c2s=\u03c1B in the T \u2212 \u03bcB plane. Figures 3 and 4 indicate that c2s=\u03c1B decreases rapidly in the crossover region with the increase of chiral condensate (dynamical quark mass). It means that the masses of quasiparticles play a crucial role on the speed of sound in QCD matter. A minimum of c2s=\u03c1B appears in the lowtemperature side of the chiral crossover transformation, which happens to coincide with the deconfinement phase transition. Some similar features were discussed in [48]. The dip structure shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 was also discovered in the LQCD simulation at zero chemical\n094024-4\npotential [1,5,7,8,47]. However, such a feature does not appear in the NJL model which lacks the confinement, at least not obvious [28,49\u201351]. It hints that the deconfinement transformation involved simultaneously also plays a vital role in the evolution. In Fig. 5, we present the value of c2s=\u03c1B along the chiral phase transition line. It indicates that c2s=\u03c1B decreases along the chiral crossover transition line from zero chemical potential to the CEP. A noticeable feature is that c2s=\u03c1B approaches to almost zero at the CEP. This is consistent with the critical slowing down, since in the critical region a small perturbation can induce drastic density fluctuation, to the disadvantage of the spread of wave. There are two branches of c2s=\u03c1B for the first-order phase transition. One branch is for the chiral restored phase, the other one is for the chiral breaking phase. It is obvious that c2s=\u03c1B in the chiral restored phase is much larger than that in the chiral breaking phase. This reflects again that the dynamical quark mass affects greatly on the EOS of quark matter. Figure 4 also shows that there exist an area in the quarkyonic phase where c2s=\u03c1B has relatively larger values. It is not difficult to understand such a result from the restoration of chiral phase transition of u, d quark. However, the strange quark still has a larger mass. With the increase of chemical potential, the value of c2s=\u03c1B decreases again before the occurrence of the first-order phase transition of the strange quark. At extreme high baryon chemical potential, c2s=\u03c1B increases again after the chiral restoration of strange quark. It means that c2s=\u03c1B at low temperature has a hierarchy along the chemical potential since the chiral phase transitions for u\u00f0d\u00de quark and s quark take place in sequence."

            "heading": "B. Speed of sound at constant baryon density and entropy density",
            "text": "In the following we study the squared speed of sound at constant baryon density and constant entropy density. The two definitions of sound velocity are usually used in the intermediate description of hydrodynamic evolution. For example, the temporal derivatives of temperature and chemical potential are functions of c2s and c2\u03c1B , as\n\u22020T \u00bc \u2212c2\u03c1BT\u2207 \u00b7 u; \u00f016\u00de and\n\u22020\u03bcB \u00bc \u2212c2s\u03bcB\u2207 \u00b7 u; \u00f017\u00de where u denotes the space component of four-velocity. In Fig. 6, we show the contour map of c2\u03c1B in the T \u2212 \u03bcB plane. To demonstrate the path of constant baryon density, four curves with \u03c1B \u00bc 0.1; 1; 5; 10\u03c10 (\u03c10 is the saturation density of nuclear matter) are plotted. The contour plot shows that the squared speed of sound c2\u03c1B also approaches to 1=3 at high temperature. Similar to the behavior of c2s=\u03c1B , a minimum of c2\u03c1B appears along the deconfinement phase transition in the crossover region. However, the deference between c2\u03c1B and c 2 s=\u03c1B\ngrows with the decrease of temperature. The paths of constant \u03c1B in T \u2212 \u03bcB plane are almost perpendicular with those of constant s=\u03c1B in a wide area. It just indicates the sensitivity of the change of interaction to temperature and chemical potential. It is interesting that there exists an area of negative c2\u03c1B in the quarkyonic phase. In this region, with the increase of energy density, the pressure decreases along the path of a constant density. We present the contour map of c2s in Fig. 7. Similar to Figs. 4 and 6, we plot four curves with s \u00bc 0.01; 1; 5; 10fm\u22123 to show the relation between entropy density\n094024-5\nand \u00f0T; \u03bcB\u00de. The numerical result also shows that c2s is close to 1=3 at high temperature. Besides, there is a large area where the value of c2s is negative at the lower left in Fig. 7. The other negative area is in a narrow range near the chiral crossover phase transition not far from the CEP. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the negative values appear for both c2\u03c1B and c 2 s . More accurately, the partial derivative of \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00de\u03c1B or \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00des is negative in some regions. It is not worrying about the negative values, because c2s=\u03c1B , rather than c2\u03c1B and c 2 s , is the sound velocity under the adiabatic condition in the hydrodynamic evolution. Nevertheless, it is very significative to find the underlying reason to explain the behaviors of c2\u03c1B and c 2 s in the full phase diagram.\nApplying the thermodynamic relation\n\u2202\u03bcB \u2202T\ns=\u03c1B\n\u00b7 \u2202T \u2202\u00f0s=\u03c1B\u00de\n\u03bcB\n\u00b7 \u2202\u00f0s=\u03c1B\u00de \u2202\u03bcB T \u00bc \u22121; \u00f018\u00de\nand the formulas of Eqs. (5) and (6), we can obtain\n\u2202\u03bcB \u2202T\ns=\u03c1B\n\u00bc \u03bcB T c2s c2\u03c1B \u00bc \u03bcB T \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00des \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00de\u03c1B : \u00f019\u00de\nThis equation indicates clearly that \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00des and \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00de\u03c1B have opposite sign for the case of \u00f0\u2202\u03bcB\u2202T \u00des=\u03c1B < 0. As shown by the isentropic curves in Fig. 1, such a situation does exist at the lower left of the T \u2212 \u03bcB phase diagram and a small neighboring area of chiral-crossover transformation near the CEP, as well as a part of the quarkyonic phase. The contour maps in Figs. 6 and 7 precisely proves this conclusion. It is instructive to take this result in hydrodynamics simulation when the critical region and low-temperature region is involved. In the following, we try to explore the physical meaning of the negative values of \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00de\u03c1B or \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00des in quark matter.\nUsually, a disturbance travels through matter with the sound velocity since it obeys the propagation equation of sound wave. To build the sound wave equation, \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00dex > 0 is required to make sure that the disturbance (pressure gradient) can propagate in waves. However, the nonperturbative interaction of QCD is much more complicated than ordinary matter, and there exists some regions where c2s \u00bc \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00des < 0 or c2\u03c1B \u00bc \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00de\u03c1B < 0 under the condition of \u00f0\u2202\u03bcB\u2202T \u00des=\u03c1B < 0. In this case, the wave equation at constant s or \u03c1B will be broken, and turns into another equation whose solution is a decay function. It means the disturbance at constant s or \u03c1B will not propagate in the form of sound wave, but decay soon. The main reason is that the increase of pressure is associated with the decrease of energy density, contrary to the sound wave propagation condition. Therefore, the negative values of c2s \u00bc \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00des or c2\u03c1B \u00bc \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00de\u03c1B in Figs. 6 and 7 indicate the region where the pressure gradient cannot be spread out in waves but decay under the condition of constant s or \u03c1B, respectively. Correspondingly, cs and c\u03c1B in such a situation are no longer the real sound velocities in the conventional sense. We should also note that, for the adiabatic sound velocity, c2s=\u03c1B \u00bc \u00f0 \u2202p \u2202\u03f5\u00des=\u03c1B is always positive in the stable phase, but negative values possibly appear in the unstable or metastable phase when the spinodal structure of the firstorder phase transition is included (It is outside the scope of this work). A further study including the metastable and unstable phase associated with the first-order phase transition will be done in the future to provide more insights on sound velocity in QCD matter."

            "text": "In this work, we studied the squared speed of sound in QCD matter under five different definitions in the PNJL model using the grand canonical ensemble. The different definitions of speed of sound mean that the derivative of p respect to \u03f5 are taken along different orientations, which can indicate important properties of the equation of state. The squared speed of sound under five definitions are all\napproaching to 1=3, the Stefan-Boltzmann limit, at high temperature. It indicates that the speed of sound of quarkgluon plasma at high temperature is not sensitive to the path of taking the derivative of p respect to \u03f5. It is just the feature of the chiral restored and deconfined phase. The situations become complicated at finite temperature\nand chemical potential due to the nonperturbative interaction and (T, \u03bcB) dependent phase transition. we analyzed the relations between the squared speed of sound and the phase transitions. From the perspective of fluid evolution, the value of c2s=\u03c1B has a rapid decrease in the chiral crossover region from higher temperature to lower temperature. A minimum appears at the low-temperature side of the chiral crossover transformation, which coincides with the deconfinement phase transition in the PNJL model. The value of c2s=\u03c1B approaches to almost zero at the CEP. There also exists a hierarchical behavior of c2s=\u03c1B between u\u00f0d\u00de and s quark at low temperature with the increasing chemical potential. We also discussed the relations of squared speed of\nsound under different definitions, in particular the correlation between c2s and c2\u03c1B . We found \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00de\u03c1B and \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00des take opposite sign for the case of \u00f0\u2202\u03bcB\u2202T \u00des=\u03c1B < 0. Such a situation indeed exists in the QCD phase diagram. For the case of \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00des < 0 or \u00f0\u2202p\u2202\u03f5\u00de\u03c1B < 0, cs and c\u03c1B in such a situation are no longer the real sound velocities. Attention should be paid when the corresponding speed of sound is taken in hydrodynamics simulation in the critical region and the low-temperature region involved."
