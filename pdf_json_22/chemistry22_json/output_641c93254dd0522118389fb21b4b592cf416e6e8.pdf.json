    "abstractText": "Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) has been frequently observed worldwide which causes mortality due to the coronary artery atherosclerosis (Fowkes et al. 2017). Increase the number of CAD led to investigations of different treatment approaches (Davidson et al. 2018). Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) tools, such as cardiac magnetic resonance Abstract Background: [F]Flurpiridaz is a promising novel cardiac PET imaging tracer formed by the radiolabeling of pyridaben derivative with fluorine-18. Clinical studies on [F] Flurpiridaz are currently at the phase III level for the assessment of MPI. Providing high image quality thanks to its relatively long half-life, F-18 is a high-potential radionuclide for the early detection of CAD. In this study, we aimed to develop a fully automated synthesis of [F]Flurpiridaz without further preparative HPLC purification. Results: Precursor 6 was obtained by multi-step synthesis starting from mucochloric acid (1) as a sole product with 35% yield and identified by spectroscopic measurement. Manually cold labeling experiments were performed using the stable isotope [F]F, and TBA-HCO3 PTC provided desirable fluorinated compound with high yield. A fully automated [F]Flurpiridaz synthesis on the ML-PT device provided 55\u201365% radiochemical yield with more than 98% radiochemical purity. The final product purification method demonstrated that [F]Flurpiridaz could be obtained without an external preparative HPLC system as a pharmaceutical quality. Conclusion: A novel and fascinating strategy was developed for the fully automated synthesis of [F]Flurpiridaz (7) on ML PT. Organic synthesis of precursor 6 was achieved with a desirable yield and characterized by NMR and HR-MS. A detailed set of cold experiments were completed for optimization conditions before hot trials and TBAHCO3 increased molar activity with a minimum amount of side products. Radiolabeling showed that our self-designed automated synthesis method enables high radiochemical yield and radiochemical purity for the production of [F]Flurpiridaz. The desirable radiopharmaceutical quality of the product was obtained without using an additional preparative HPLC system. [F]Flurpiridaz (7) preserved its stability within 12 h and final specifications were consistent with the acceptance criteria in Ph. Eur. regulations.",

Gebze Organize Sanayi, 41400 Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey\n(CMR), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have for the past decades attracted increasing interest for an accurate diagnosis of coronary heart disease (Danad et\u00a0 al. 2017). [99Tc]Tc-Sestamibi, approved agent by FDA is well known SPECT-tracer as a diagnostic agent for clinics. Even though it has been widely used as a diagnostic agent, it has some limitations such as less spatial resolution and additional correction measurement (Wu et\u00a0al. 2009). Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) has been most widely utilized in MPI due to the better diagnostic performance, high resolution of images and lower radiation exposure (Di Carli et\u00a0al. 2007). Even though, [82Rb]Rb (Huang et\u00a0al. 1989), [13N]N (Schelbert et\u00a0al. 1981), [11C]C (Croteau et\u00a0 al. 2012), and [15O]O (Bergmann et\u00a0 al. 1989) have been exhibited as PET radionuclides for the detection of MPI, shorter half-life and higher cost cause a limit of their widespread use. For example, [82Rb]Rb generator is replaced every one month with a high amount of cost (\u20ac 30.000 per one month). Recently, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA has been exhibited as an alternative PET agent for MPI in small animals however comprehensive clinical trials are necessary to be a reliable diagnostic agent (Autio et\u00a0 al. 2020). Those limitations of available PET tracers have led to a need for an optimal perfusion agent with improved properties. [18F]Flurpiridaz is an ideal pyridaben-derivative 18F-labeled MPI agent which binds to mitochondrial complex (MC) I inhibitor with high affinity (Scheme\u00a0 1) (Maddahi et\u00a0 al. 2020). Preclinical and clinical trials have indicated that [18F]Flurpiridaz is clinically safe and enhances a high-resolution quality of image and particularly it is more favorable in women, obese patients and patients with multivessel disease. (Berman et\u00a0al. 2013) Besides, one cyclotron site can be sufficient for dose distribution to many different nuclear medicine centers due to the relatively long physical half-life feature of Fluorine-18.\nTo the best our knowledge, detailed radiolabeling study of [18F]Flurpiridaz (7) has not been published yet despite expected popularity of its use in many clinics. In this article, the scope was to demonstrate a fully automated synthesis of [18F]Flurpiridaz (7) radiopharmaceutical considering radiation safety and in accordance with regulations of radiopharmaceutical preparations by using commercially available an automated synthesis platform namely Modular Lab-PharmTracer (ML PT) for the first time."

Residue was subjected to flash column chromatography (silica gel 40\u00a0 g, EtOAc/Hexane 3:2) and 0.91\u00a0 g of compound 3 was obtained as white solid. Then, 0.91\u00a0 g of an alcoholic compound 3 was dissolved in 15\u00a0ml of freshly distilled dichloromethane and 0.14\u00a0ml of PBr3 was slowly added to the solution. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for about 2\u00a0h under nitrogen atmosphere. Crude product was extracted with 30\u00a0ml of water and dried under vacuum. White solid product 4 was successfully obtained in a quantitative yield without further purification for next step. KOtBu (0.28\u00a0g, 2.49\u00a0mmol) and 11.2\u00a0ml of ethylene glycol were stirred at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. Then, 0.95\u00a0g of bromide compound 4 dissolved in 8\u00a0ml of dry THF was added slowly into the reaction mixture and the reaction was stirred at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for overnight.

An appropriate system configuration enhances an efficient option for preparation of popular fluorine-18 based tracers such as [18F]F-FES, [18F]F-FDG, [18F] F-PSMA-1007 and[18F]F-FLT.\nIn light of the routine an automatically production of above fluorine-based compounds, we aimed to develop a fully automated synthesis of [18F]Flurpiridaz (7). Firstly,\nstepwise organic synthesis of flurpiridaz precursor (6) was achieved with a total yield of 35% and confirmed by NMR and HR-MS (Scheme\u00a02).\nAfter pure isolation of precursor 6, optimized condition was aimed for radiolabeling of precursor 6. In this work, amount of precursor, solvent type, reaction time and temperature were kept constant due to the previously published comprehensive study (Cesati et\u00a0al. 2015). Firstly, cold experiments were tried to optimize reaction conditions without radioactive exposure. Stable isotope [19F]F was employed for nucleophilic substitution reaction. 19Flouride was trapped with QMA cartridge followed by elution with Kryptofix K2.2.2./K2CO3 as a phase transfer catalyst (PTC) which is widely used in [18F] flourine radiolabeling reactions. HPLC UV analysis (Fig.\u00a03a) indicated that there was a dramatic increase of unexpected side products and a low amount of fluorination yield was observed. On the contrary, the chemical yield of fluorination increased with a minimum amount of side products in the presence of TBA-HCO3 (Fig.\u00a03b). The main reason for this result is that HCO3\u2212 decreased the hydrolysis rate and increased the fluorination yield (Fig.\u00a03a). Unfortunately, the basicity of K2CO3 caused the decomposition of the product and reduced fluorination yield. (Vavere et\u00a0al. 2018). HR-MS and HPLC spectra identified relative quantity taking part in a reaction and precursor 6, side products, and [19F]Flurpiridaz (7) were well determined (Fig.\u00a03,4).\nAfter a sequential manually cold synthesis of [19F]Flurpiridaz (7), an automated synthesis of radioactive fluorine compound was tried and each step was optimized with consecutive studies (Table\u00a01). Fluorination of the precursor 6 is formed by SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction. The nucleophile [18F]flouride attacks the backside of the carbon atom and the tosylate group was easily separated from the electrophilic carbon atom (Scheme\u00a0 3). In general, use of polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile is very important for the activity of nucleophiles in SN2 nucleophilic substitution reactions. Polar protic molecules such as water and ethanol make hydrogen bonds with nucleophiles, and they reduce the activity of nucleophiles and the yield of the labeling reaction. The cleavage of hydrogen bonds has to be afforded so that the nucleophile can attack to the electrophilic carbon. The fluoride ion, a weak nucleophile, is dramatically affected by the presence of impurities even in trace amounts during the labeling process and the reaction yield decreases. Therefore, evaporation of solvents and drying of TBA-[18F]F & TBA-HCO3 after QMA cartridge elution is a very critical process for desirable radiolabeling yield. The nature of the solvent is another critical parameter and anhydrous acetonitrile has to be used for high radiochemical yield.\nCarefully spectral analyses showed that there were four main components in the postreaction mixture; free [18F]F, [18F]Flurpiridaz (7), non-radiolabeled precursor 6, and one side-product (Fig.\u00a03 (b)). In general, combined preparative HPLC system is frequently\nScheme\u00a03 SN2 reaction of precursor 6\nutilized for the purification of the final fluorinated product in literature (Wang et\u00a0 al. 2020). Even this purification system has significant advantage for purification, this system is quite expensive, and a larger hot cell is required. For this reason, we aimed to design a simplified system for fast purification without using preparative HPLC. In our purification method, after the completion of radiolabeling, the reaction mixture was loaded onto the tC18 cartridge, and free fluorine and other polar impurities were transferred into the waste vial by water. Impurities which were slightly more polar than [18F] Flurpiridaz (7) were washed into the waste vial by 16\u00a0ml of purification solution (40% ethanol/60% WFI, 50\u00a0mg/mL of ascorbic acid). At this step, the flow rate and ethanol concentration are another critical case for the exact separation of substances. The ascorbic acid in the solution was used to prevent radiolysis on the tC18 cartridge during this process. Then, the final product [18F]Flurpiridaz (7) was eluted with 5\u00a0 ml of solution (50% ethanol-50% WFI) into a 30\u00a0ml capacity injector with a certain flow rate. In this step, slightly non-polar precursor 6 also remained on the tC18 cartridge. Precursor 6 is not water-soluble, for this reason, an additional 20\u00a0ml of water was sent to the injector to precipitate precursor 6, in case even trace amounts of precursor 6 are eluted with the final product. Finally, [18F]Flurpiridaz (7) was successfully transferred to the final product vial through the alumina cartridge and two 0.2-micron sterilization filters. The alumina cartridge removed free [18F]F residue, while the 0.2-micron filters prevented the precipitated precursor 6 from passing into the final product vial. The final product consists of [18F]Flurpiridaz (7), 7\u20138% ethanol, and 50\u00a0mg/ml of ascorbic acid with a total volume of 30\u00a0 ml. Ethanol and ascorbic acid are important for final product stabilization. [18F]Flurpiridaz (7) was produced with decay-corrected 55\u201365% radiochemical yield, > 98% radiochemical purity, and in radiopharmaceutical quality (Tables\u00a03, 4). Stability studies have demonstrated that the final product protected its stability with initial radiopharmaceutical quality for 12\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a07)."
