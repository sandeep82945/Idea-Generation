    "abstractText": "We exploit the unprecedented depth of integral field data from the KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity Survey (KURVS) to analyse the strong (H\u03b1) and forbidden ([Nii], [Sii]) emission line ratios in 22 main-sequence galaxies at z \u2248 1.5. Using the [Nii]/H\u03b1 emission-line ratio we confirm the presence of the stellar mass \u2013 gas-phase metallicity relation at this epoch, with galaxies exhibiting on average 0.13\u00b1 0.04 dex lower gas-phase metallicity (12+log(O/H)M13 = 8.40\u00b1 0.03) for a given stellar mass (log10(M\u2217[M\u2299] = 10.1\u00b1 0.1) than local main-sequence galaxies. We determine the galaxy-integrated [Sii] doublet ratio, with a median value of [Sii]\u03bb6716/\u03bb6731 = 1.26\u00b1 0.14 equivalent to an electron density of log10(ne[cm\u22123]) = 1.95\u00b1 0.12. Utilising CANDELS HST multi-band imaging we define the pixel surface-mass and star-formation rate density in each galaxy and spatially resolve the fundamental metallicity relation at z \u2248 1.5, finding an evolution of 0.05\u00b1 0.01 dex compared to the local relation. We quantify the intrinsic gas-phase metallicity gradient within the galaxies using the [Nii]/H\u03b1 calibration, finding a median annuli-based gradient of \u0394Z/\u0394R=\u22120.015\u00b1 0.005 dex kpc\u22121. Finally we examine the azimuthal variations in gas-phase metallicity, which show a negative correlationwith the galaxy integrated star-formation rate surface density (rs =\u22120.40, ps = 0.07) but no connection to the galaxies kinematic or morphological properties nor radial variations in stellar mass surface density or star formation rate surface density. This suggests both the radial and azimuthal variations in interstellar medium properties are connected to the galaxy integrated density of recent star formation.",

From a clumpy, irregular high-redshift (\ud835\udc67 \u2248 1 \u2212 2) population to the grand-design Hubbletype galaxies seen in the local Universe (e.g. Glazebrook et al. 1995; Abraham et al. 1996; Ilbert et al. 2010; Conselice 2014; Sachdeva et al. 2019). This evolution has been defined in terms of the galaxy\u2019s fundamental properties (e.g. star-formation rate, gas fraction, angu-\n\u2605 E-mail: srigi@space.dtu.dk\nlar momentum and chemical abundance) with high-redshift galaxies exhibiting higher star-formation rates and gas fractions whilst having lower angular momentum and gas-phase metallicity at fixed stellar mass (e.g. F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2009;Whitaker et al. 2012; Tacconi et al. 2013; Swinbank et al. 2017; Gillman et al. 2021). Constraining the physical properties of the interstellar medium, and the role of the evolving baryon cycle, in high-redshift main-sequence galaxies is vital in order to fully explain the nature of these differences (see Maiolino & Mannucci 2019; Tacconi et al. 2020; F\u00f6rster Schreiber & Wuyts 2020, for full reviews).\nObservational studies have shown that the empirical scaling re-\nnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/m nras/stac580/6543716 by D TU Library user on 15 M arch 2022\nO R IG\nIN A\nL U\nN E D\nIT E D\nM A\nN U\nS C\nR IP\nT"

            "text": "lations present in the local Universe that interconnect a galaxy\u2019s fundamental properties are in place at high-redshift, but with variable normalisation and or intrinsic scatter (e.g. the star-formation main-sequence; Whitaker et al. 2012; Schreiber et al. 2015, angular momentum stellar mass relation; Burkert et al. 2016; Harrison et al. 2017, Tully-Fisher relation; \u00dcbler et al. 2017; Tiley et al. 2019). In particular the gas-phase metallicity stellar mass relation (MZR) has been observed up to a redshift of \ud835\udc67 \u2248 3.3, with a normalisation that decreases with increasing redshift, at fixed stellar mass (e.g. Mannucci et al. 2010; Yabe et al. 2015; Steidel et al. 2014; Wuyts et al. 2016; Kashino et al. 2017; Sanders et al. 2020; Gillman et al. 2021). The gas-phase metallicity of the interstellar medium in distant galaxies is quantified using strong-line calibrations of rest-frame optical emission lines (e.g. Pettini & Pagel 2004; Kewley & Ellison 2008; Marino et al. 2013; Dopita et al. 2016; Poetrodjojo et al. 2021). By using these locally derived calibrations, that convert an emission-line ratio (e.g. [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc, O3N2, R23) to an Oxygen abundance (12+log10(O/H)), the gas-phase metallicity in distant galaxies can be constrained. The decrease in normalisation of the MZR at higher redshifts is attributed to the higher star-formation rates and increased metal-poor gas inflows at earlier cosmic times as well as evolution in the outflow strength, gas fraction and star-formation efficiency of galaxies (e.g. Lilly et al. 2013; Lian et al. 2018; Sanders et al. 2020). Tracing the distribution of metallicity in galaxies across cosmic time provides empirical constraints for theoretical models aimed at describing the complex interplay between star formation, gas flows and feedback processes that drive a galaxy\u2019s evolution (e.g. Trayford & Schaye 2019; Belfiore et al. 2019; Sharda et al. 2021a; Yates et al. 2021). However, a number of physical parameters appear to determine the strong optical emission-line fluxes produced in Hii regions. These include the chemical abundance of the gas but also the shape and normalisation of the ionising spectrum, the ionisation state of the gas and the gas density (e.g. Dopita & Evans 1986; Kewley & Dopita 2002; Dopita et al. 2006a,b; Kewley et al. 2019a; Kumari et al. 2021; Ji & Yan 2021; Curti et al. 2021; Helton et al. 2022). These strongline calibrations assume that the interstellar medium conditions at high-redshift are similar to those found in local galaxies, such that the variation in emission-line ratios is driven purely by changes in the chemical abundance (e.g. Bian et al. 2018, 2020; Hayden-Pawson et al. 2021). By defining the fundamental properties of the interstellar medium in distant galaxies, we can begin to constrain the origin of the variation in emission-line ratios. In the local Universe spatially-resolved studies of galaxies have identified negative metallicity gradients in star-forming galaxies (e.g. S\u00e1nchez et al. 2014; Belfiore et al. 2017; Lutz et al. 2021) as well as the presence of the resolved mass - metallicity relation on sub-kpc scales (e.g. Barrera-Ballesteros et al. 2016; Erroz-Ferrer et al. 2019; S\u00e1nchez 2020; Neumann et al. 2021). The secular evolution of local galaxies is well prescribed by \u2018inside-out\u2019 models of galaxy evolution that explain the higher metallicity in the central regions (e.g. Nelson et al. 2012). In addition to robust measures of the chemical abundance properties, constraining the emission-line ratios of faint forbidden emissionlines (e.g. [Nii], [Sii]) in galaxies enables constraints on other interstellar medium properties such as electron density (e.g. Dopita et al. 2016; Maiolino & Mannucci 2019; Kewley et al. 2019a,b). In distant galaxies however, measuring even integrated properties of faint emission-lines is challenging due to the low-surface brightness and signal to noise (S/N). Previous studies have overcome these issues by stacking galaxy spectra in order to measure sample averaged emission-line properties (e.g. Swinbank et al. 2019; F\u00f6rster\nSchreiber et al. 2019; Davies et al. 2021; Henry et al. 2021) or utilised either space-based low-resolution grism spectroscopy (e.g. Jones et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2020; Simons et al. 2020; Backhaus et al. 2021) or gravitationally lensed galaxies (e.g. Curti et al. 2020b; Patr\u00edcio et al. 2019; Florian et al. 2020; Hayden-Pawson et al. 2021). To define the interstellar medium properties of high-redshift galaxies and establish whether the global scaling relations (e.g. mass \u2013 metallicity, star-formation rate main \u2013 sequence) originate from localised relations within individual galaxy\u2019s requires us to go beyond stacks and even integrated emission-line ratios for individual distant galaxies. To this end, in this paper we present an analysis of the chemical abundance properties of the interstellar medium, using a variety of metallicity indicators, in 22 galaxies from the KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity Survey (KURVS; Puglisi et al. in preparation, hereafter P22) each observed for \u224870 hours on source with KMOS. In Section 2 we present the observations and the main-sequence properties of KURVS galaxies. We then define the gas-phase metallicity properties and emission-line ratios in Section 3.1 before quantifying the electron density in Section 3.2. In Section 3.3.1 we derive the resolved fundamental metallicity relation before finally in section 3.3.2 quantifying the radial profiles of metallicity and electron density before giving our conclusions in Section 4. A Nine-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (Hinshaw et al. 2013) cosmology is used throughout this work with\u03a9\u039b = 0.721, \u03a9m = 0.279 and H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. In this cosmology a spatial resolution of 0.57 arcsecond (the median FWHM of the seeing in our data) corresponds to a physical scale of 4.9 kpc at a redshift of \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5. All quoted magnitudes are on the AB system and stellar masses are calculated assuming a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF) (Chabrier 2003)."

These emission lines, alongside a number of atmospheric OH airglow emission lines, are visible in the KMOS spectra. In Figure 1 we show the integrated spectra for the 22 galaxies in the KURVS sample, ranked by their stellar mass. We highlight (in grey) the strong OH emission lines present in each spectrum, and overlay a Gaussian profile fit (in green) to the H\ud835\udefc, [Nii], and [Sii] emission lines as well as showing the residuals. Each data cube has been deredshifted and the velocity field removed. The integrated spectrum is a sum of the spaxels resolved in the H\ud835\udefc velocity map of the galaxy, as discussed in Section 3.1. Figure 1 demonstrates the presence of the stellar mass \u2013 metallicity relation in the KURVS sample, with the increasing presence of forbidden emission lines with increasing stellar mass. It is important\nto understand whether the emission lines shown in Figure 1 originate from star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN). The presence of an AGN would enhance the emission-line ratios of a galaxy and thus make them a unreliable tracer of the galaxies metallicity. To determine the presence of AGN in the KURVS sample, we first utilise the AGN identification scheme employed by Tiley et al. (2021) for the full KGES sample. In short AGN are identified in our sample by criteria placed on their integrated [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio, emission-line width and infrared colours following the Donley et al. (2012) and Stern et al. (2012) colour selection (see Tiley et al. (2021) for full details). We also exclude galaxies with bright X-ray counterparts by cross-matching our sample with the CDFS 7Ms Source Catalog (Luo et al. 2017). Of the 22 galaxies in the KURVS sample, we identify two candidates where an AGN may influence the line ratios. KURVS 11 and KURVS 12 have \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc381 colour W1[3.6]\u2212W2[4.5]>0.8, whilst KURVS 12 is also highlighted in the Luo et al.

KURVS 11 has an intrinsic 0.5 \u2013 7.0 kev X-ray luminosity of \ud835\udc3fX,int=5.312\u00d71041 ergs\u22121, but this is below the AGN threshold of the Luo et al. (2017) catalogue (\ud835\udc3fX,int \u22653\u00d71042 ergs\u22121). Three other galaxies in the sample (KURVS 14, 15 and 22) have X-ray counterparts but luminosities that lie below the AGN threshold.

Gillman et al. (2020) measure the stellar masses of the KGES galaxies by fitting their UV\u2013mid-infrared SEDs with the magphys software (da Cunha et al. 2008, 2015). For the two galaxies selected form theKMOS3D survey, we employ this process, deriving amedian stellar mass (and bootstrapped uncertainty) for the KURVS-CDFS sample of log10(\ud835\udc40\u2217[\ud835\udc40\u2299]) = 10.1\u00b1 0.1. The deep CANDELS (Koekemoer et al. 2011) HST imaging data of the KURVS-CDFS galaxies can be used to quantify the stellar continuum half-light radius of the galaxies. Using the 1.6\ud835\udf07m (F160W) imaging van der Wel et al. (2014) derived the stellar-continuum size (\ud835\udc45h), S\u00e9rsic index (\ud835\udc5b) and axis ratio of the CANDELS galaxies modelling the two-dimensional stellar-light profiles of the galaxies with the galfit (Peng et al. 2011) software. This analysis was independently verified in Gillman et al. (2020) for the KGES galaxies that lie within the CANDELS HST fields. The median F160W stellar continuum half-light radius of the KURVS-CDFS galaxies is \ud835\udc45h[kpc] = 3.28\u00b1 0.42. This places the KURVS-CDFS sample within 1\u2212\ud835\udf0e of the expected size (\ud835\udc45h[kpc] = 3.48) from the van derWel et al. (2014) mass-size relation at log10(\ud835\udc40\u2217[\ud835\udc40\u2299]) = 10.1. The derivation of the H\ud835\udefc fluxes for the KURVS-CDFS objects is discussed in P22. The H\ud835\udefc flux is corrected for dust extinction using the V-band stellar attenuation (\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc49 ) derived from magphys SED fitting and applying the methods ofWuyts et al. (2013) and assuming a Calzetti et al. (1994) extinction law such that,\n\ud835\udc34H\ud835\udefc,gas = \ud835\udc34H\ud835\udefc,stars (1.9 \u2212 0.15\ud835\udc34H\ud835\udefc,stars), (1)\nas defined in Stott et al. (2016) where \ud835\udc34H\ud835\udefc,stars is the rest-frame stellar attenuation at the wavelength of H\ud835\udefc. The median rest-frame nebular attenuation at the wavelength of H\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc34H\ud835\udefc,gas) for the sample is \ud835\udc34H\ud835\udefc,gas = 1.21. We derive a median H\ud835\udefc star-formation of SFRH\ud835\udefc[M\u2299yr\u22121] = 24\u00b1 6, which is comparable to the KGES comparison sample. In Table 1 we summarise the main-sequence properties of the KURVS-CDFS sample. To establish the position of the KURVS-CDFS galaxies with respect to star-forming galaxy population at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5, we define the relation between stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR\u2212\ud835\udc40\u2217) following Schreiber et al. (2015) and the relation between stellar continuum half-light radii and stellar mass (\ud835\udc45h\u2212\ud835\udc40\u2217) following van der Wel et al. (2014) at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5. In Figure 2 we show offset from the SFR\u2212\ud835\udc40\u2217 relation as function of the offset from the median \ud835\udc45h\u2212\ud835\udc40\u2217 for the KURVS-CDFS sample. Galaxies from the KGES comparison sample are shown in the background, with histograms of each sample shown on each axis, indicating a similar distributions of stellar mass and star-formation rate in both the 71 selected KGES galaxies and the KURVS-CDFS sample. The two AGN (as defined in Section 2.2) are indicated by crosses and we colour the galaxies by their gas-phase metallicity as derived following the strong-line calibration of Marino et al. (2013) (Section 3.1). Galaxies that exhibit smaller stellar continuum sizes tend to have lower H\ud835\udefc star-formation rates than \u2018typical\u2019 galaxies at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5 of\nthe same stellar mass. Figure 2 indicates that KURVS-CDFS galaxies represent main-sequence galaxies at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5 with a small scatter about the SFR\u2212\ud835\udc40\u2217 and \ud835\udc45h\u2212\ud835\udc40\u2217 relations at this epoch. By quantifying the properties of the emission lines in the KURVS-CDFS galaxies, as we go on to do in the next section, we can derive physical constraints on the chemical abundance and electron density properties of the interstellar medium in main-sequence galaxies \u224810Gyr ago."

To quantify the gas-phase metallicity of the galaxies in the KURVS-CDFS sample, we first de-redshift and remove the velocity field of the galaxies from the datacubes. To do so we normalize each spaxel\u2019s spectra by the spectroscopic redshift of the galaxy, as determined from the H\ud835\udefc emission line. We then use the H\ud835\udefc velocity map of the galaxy, as derived in P22, to shift each spaxels spectrum by the mean velocity at that position. The result, as shown in Figure 1, is that the H\ud835\udefc emission line is centred at the rest-frame wavelength of 6563\u00c5. We note that the velocity field is derived using an adaptive binning technique on the datacube with a spaxel H\ud835\udefc signal-to-noise (S/N) threshold of S/N\u22655 (see P22 for details). This velocity field thus defines the region in which we calculate the de-redshifted integrated spectrum of the galaxy. Any spaxels outside of the velocity map (i.e. S/N<5) are excluded as we do not have a velocity correction for these spaxels and we do not expect faint lines beyond the extent of the H\ud835\udefc and [Nii] map. By transforming the spectrum to rest-frame, the rotational broadening of the emission lines are removed.We can then stack the spectra in individual spaxels to measure both the integrated and radial dependence of metallicity in each galaxy. We apply this procedure to all 22 galaxies in the KURVS-CDFS sample. To quantify the emission-line properties of the KURVSCDFS galaxies we define an integrated spectra for each galaxy by summing the spectra in the de-redshifted KMOS data cubes. We then fit an emission line model composed of five Gaussian profiles to the H\ud835\udefc, [Nii] and [Sii] emission lines present in each galaxies spectra. The Gaussian profile centers (redshift) and FWHM (velocity dispersion) are fixed to a common value and we set the flux ratio of the [Nii] doublet to be 2.8 following Osterbrock & Ferland (2006). To avoid erroneous fits, the fitting was performed using a \ud835\udf122 minimisation method which weights against the wavelengths of the brightest OH skylines (as visible in Figure 1).

(2013) (hereafter M13) to derive the galaxies gas-phase metallicity. The calibration derived by M13 is more accurate at high metallicities (12+log(O/H)>8.2) due to the inclusion of spectroscopic observations allowing the electron temperature to be constrained in this regime. This is opposed to the photoionization modelling originally used by Pettini & Pagel (2004). The calibration is defined as;\n12 + log(O/H)M13 = 8.743 + 0.462 log10 ( [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc) (2)\n2 KURVS 8 has [Nii] S/N\u22642 3 KURVS 2, 7 and 19 have [Sii] S/N\u22642\nand has an inherent uncertainty of 0.16 dex.

(2021) demonstrate that the M13 calibration is in closer agreement with other metallicity indicators than the Pettini & Pagel (2004) calibration when inferring a galaxy\u2019s gas-phase Oxygen abundance. The median [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio (and bootstrapped uncertainty) of the KURVS-CDFS sample is [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc = 0.18\u00b1 0.03 which corresponds to median metallicity of 12+log(O/H)M13 = 8.40\u00b1 0.03. In Figure 2 we show the mass\u2013metallicity relation (MZR) for the KURVSCDFS sample derived using the M13 calibration. We indicate the relations from Andrews & Martini (2013) at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 0, Zahid et al. (2014) at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.4 \u2212 1.7 and Topping et al. (2021) at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5 as well as showing the KGES sample in the background. All comparison samples metallicities have been derived using the M13 calibration.

In Figure 2 we colour the KGES and KURVS-CDFS samples by their H\ud835\udefc star-formation rates to highlight the presence of the fundamental mass\u2013metallicity relation (FMR) between stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity and star-formation rate (e.g. Curti et al. 2020b; Gillman et al. 2021; Henry et al. 2021).

Curti et al. (2020a) measured the best-fitting parameters are \ud835\udc4d0 = 8.779\u00b1 0.005, \ud835\udc5a0 = 10.11\u00b1 0.03, \ud835\udc5a1 = 0.56\u00b1 0.01, \ud835\udefe = 0.31\u00b1 0.01 and \ud835\udefd = 2.1\u00b1 0.4. Using the median stellar mass and star-formation rate of the KURVS-CDFS sample we can use Equation 3 to predict the gas-phase metallicity for galaxies on the FMR. At log10(\ud835\udc40\u2217[\ud835\udc40\u2299]) = 10.1\u00b1 0.1 and SFRH\ud835\udefc[M\u2299yr\u22121] = 24\u00b1 6, Equation 3 predicts Z = 8.53\u00b1 0.01 whilst the median KURVS metallicity is ZM13 = 8.40\u00b1 0.03. This indicates that the KURVS-CDFS galaxies lie \u22480.1 dex below the \ud835\udc67 \u2248 0 FMR, however we note this maybe be driven by differences in metallicity indicators (e.g. Kewley & Ellison 2008; Andrews & Martini 2013; Poetrodjojo et al. 2021)."

            "text": "The calibrations of Pettini & Pagel (2004); Marino et al. (2013) assume that the ionization parameter of the Hii region for which the calibration was derived, is the same as that being analysed. However, the [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc index varies strongly with the ionization parameter and hardness of the ionizing radiation field, as well as being dependent on the relation between log10(N/O) and log10(O/H). All three of these properties may vary at high redshift thusmaking the [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc strongline calibration degenerate with other interstellar medium properties. A recently developed strong-line calibration aimed to solve these metallicity degeneracy issues is the N2S2H\ud835\udefc calibration. Dopita et al. (2016) (hereafter D16) defined the new gas-phase metallicity calibration as,\n12+log(O/H)D16 = 8.77+log([Nii]/[Sii])+0.264 log([Nii]/H\ud835\udefc) (4)\nwhere [Nii]/[Sii] is defined as [Nii]\ud835\udf066584/[Sii]\ud835\udf066717+\ud835\udf066731. This calibration has an associated uncertanity of 0.12 dex and is expected to be less sensitive to the ionization parameter due to the [Nii]/[Sii] emission-line ratio whilst being equally unaffected by extinction due to the short wavelength separation. The [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc derived metallicity varies by \u223c1 dex with ionization parameter (Kewley et al. 2019a). By combining the [Nii]/[Sii] ratio, that has a stronger dependence on the ionization parameter than [Nii]/[Oii] ratio, with the [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio, the D16 calibration shown in Equation 4 becomes insensitive to the ionization parameter and interstellar medium pressure. However, the calibration is still strongly dependent on the assumed log10(N/O) to log10(O/H) relation, as well as a constant Sulphur to Oxygen ratio, which is calibrated from a sample of local galaxies (e.g. Izotov et al. 2006; Maiolino & Mannucci 2019). The median gas-phase metallicity derived using the D16 calibration for the KURVS-CDFS sample is 12+log(O/H)D16 = 8.43\u00b1 0.07, which is comparable to the median M13 metallicity. To analyse the conditions of the interstellarmedium in theKURVSCDFS galaxies, in Figure 3 we plot the gas-phase metallicity as derived fromD16 calibration, as a function of theM13 derived metallicity. Differences between these two calibrations provide information on the ionization parameter and the hardness of the radiation field. We also show comparison samples from Yabe et al. (2015) at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.4 from the Subaru FMOS Galaxy Redshift survey and Kashino et al. (2017) at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.6 from the FMOS-COSMOS survey, as well as the KGES comparison sample. The emission-line ratios for both literature comparison samples are derived from stacked spectra which we convert to gas-phase Oxygen abundances for the samples using Equations 2 & 4.\nThe KURVS-CDFS galaxies and comparison samples indicate a comparable relationship between the D16 andM13 metallicity. There is good agreement between the two indicators for intermediate gasphase metallicity galaxies, whilst at high (12+log(O/H)M13 > 8.5) and low (12+log(O/H)M13 < 8.3) M13 metallicity, the D16 calibration produces a higher (lower) gas-phase metallicity. We perform a linear orthogonal distance regression fit to the KURVS-CDFS galaxies of the form 12+log(O/H)D16 =\ud835\udefc (12+log(O/H)M13) + \ud835\udefd, deriving an \ud835\udefc = 2.71\u00b10.21, as indicated by the red line. Whilst the inclusion of the comparison samples results in a slope of \ud835\udefc = 2.37 \u00b1 0.14, as indicated by the blue line. In Figure 3 we colour the KURVS-CDFS galaxies, and comparison samples, by their [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio. The [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio is known to be a poor tracer of gas-phase metallicity due to its strong dependence on the ionization parameter (e.g. Maiolino & Mannucci 2019). At higher metallicities, the galaxies with higher [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratios show closer agreement between the two indicators, whilst the low [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio galaxies exhibit the largest discrepancy. At the lowest metallicities the lower [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio galaxies have a smaller offset from the one to one relation. On average the KURVS-CDFS galaxies have higher [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratios (harder ionizing spectrum) with a median [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc = 0.27\u00b1 0.02 compared to [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc = 0.20\u00b1 0.01 for the comparison samples. The M13 calibration assumes fixed N/O - O/H relation whereas the D16 calibration ratio accounts for variation in this relation which may result in the offset between the two metallicity indicators. Furthermore, D16 is based on grids from the mappings photoionisation models, in contrast to the M13 calibration which is based on local HII regions. Thus the dynamic range in metallicity is different and hence the two calibrations differ the most in the low- and high metallicity regimes."

            "text": "To further understand the properties of the interstellar medium in KURVS-CDFS galaxies, we can compare different integrated emission-line ratios. High-redshift galaxies are offset to higher emission-line ratios compared to local main-sequence galaxies however the origin of this offset is disputed with indications of harder ionizing spectrum, higher ionization parameter, and/or variable N/O abundance ratio (e.g. Kewley et al. 2013; Steidel et al. 2014; Strom et al. 2017; Topping et al. 2020; Izotov et al. 2021; Runco et al. 2021) whilst other studies suggest the offset is purely an observational selection effect (e.g. Garg et al. 2022). Sulfur is one of the \ud835\udefc elements, which include e.g. O, Ne, Si, produced primarily through nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supplied to the interstellar medium through type-II supernovae. In contrast, Nitrogen is generated through both the primary process and a secondary process where 12C and 16O initially contained in stars are converted into 14N via the CNO cycle. Therefore the [Nii]/[Sii] ratio is sensitive to the total chemical abundance, particularly in a regime where secondary nitrogen is predominant, while this ratio is almost constant if most nitrogen has a primary origin (e.g Strom et al. 2021). The [Sii]/[Nii] ratio has only a small effect by dust as the emission lines are separated by \u223c140\u00c5.\nOne useful diagnostic that also provides information on the origin of the ionizing radiation field and can distinguish between starforming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is the correlation between [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio and the [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc emission-line ratio (e.g. Sabbadin et al. 1977).

We perform a linear orthogonal distance regression fit to the data of the form [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc=\ud835\udefc ([Nii]/H\ud835\udefc) +\ud835\udefd. The KURVS-CDFS galaxies indicate no strong correlation between the emission-line ratios with an \ud835\udefc = 0.048\u00b10.088, as indicated by the red line and spearman rank correlation (\ud835\udc5fs, \ud835\udc5ds) coefficents of \ud835\udc5fs = 0.17, \ud835\udc5ds = 0.47. The inclusion of the full sample (KURVS-CDFS + literature samples) leads to a positive correlation with \ud835\udefc = 0.67 \u00b1 0.045 (blue line) and spearman rank coefficents of of \ud835\udc5fs = 0.71, \ud835\udc5ds = 0.0. Three KURVS-CDFS galaxies, KURVS 6, 12 and 22 lie at the boundary of the star-forming to star-forming and composite. KURVS 12 was identified in Section 2.2 as a candidate AGN, whilst KURVS 22 has an X-ray counterpart, but with a luminosity below the Luo et al. (2017) AGN threshold. KURVS 6 indicates no AGN spectral features, however the rest-frame optical morphology of this galaxy shows a clear bulge component which may result in higher emissionline ratios (e.g. M\u00e9ndez-Abreu et al. 2019; Pak et al. 2021). Law et al. (2021) identify strong positive correlations between the gas-phase velocity dispersion and emission-line ratios such as\n[Sii]/H\ud835\udefc, [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc in 9149 local (\ud835\udc67 = 0.04) galaxies in the MANGA survey with a stellar mass range of log10 (M\u2217 [M\u2299]) = 9 \u2013 11. They suggest the origin of the correlation is driven by the variation in ionizing source across the emission-line ratio parameter space. From Figure 3, we identify no correlation between the [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio and \ud835\udf0eH\ud835\udefc,2.2Rdof the KURVS-CDFS galaxies with a spearman rank coefficients of \ud835\udc5fs = 0.18, \ud835\udc5ds = 0.42. Whilst the [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc and \ud835\udf0eH\ud835\udefc,2.2Rd indicate a negative correlation with \ud835\udc5fs = \u22120.48, \ud835\udc5ds = 0.03 in contrast to Law et al. (2021) at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 0. We note however we are comparing integrated emission-line ratios and velocity disperions as opposed to the spaxel-wise ratios compared in Law et al. (2021)."

A possible driver of a higher ionization parameter is an\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/m nras/stac580/6543716 by D TU Library user on 15 M arch 2022\nO R IG\nIN A\nL U\nN E D\nIT E D\nM A\nN U\nS C\nR IP\nT\nResolved ISM Properties within \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5 SFGs 9\nelevated electron density (e.g. Brinchmann et al. 2008; Kashino et al. 2017; Kaasinen et al. 2017; Kewley et al. 2019b). Local galaxies have electron densities in the range of log10(\ud835\udc5be[cm\u22123])\u2248 1.5 \u2013 2, which corresponds to variation in the ionization parameter of \u22480.06 dex. Recent high-redshift studies suggest an electron density of log10(\ud835\udc5be[cm\u22123])\u2248 3 corresponding to a \u22480.5 dex increase in the ionization parameter (e.g. Sanders et al. 2016; Kewley et al. 2019b; Davies et al. 2021). In this section we quantify the electron density for individual galaxies in the KURVSCDFS sample and analyse the correlations with the galaxy\u2019s main sequence properties. The electron density can be estimated from the ratio of collisionally-excited metal lines (e.g. [Oii]\ud835\udf063726/\ud835\udf063729, [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731) (Osterbrock 1974). These emission-line ratios weakly depend on electron temperature and are largely independent of metallicity. If we assume a constant nebula temperature of T = 104 K, the interstellar medium pressure is then directly proportional to the electron density. Doing so allows us to convert the [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 ratio to an electron density following the ionization models of Kewley et al. (2019b). The [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 line ratio is density sensitive in the range log10(\ud835\udc5be[cm\u22123])\u2248 1.6 \u2013 3.7 corresponding to [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 = 1.45 \u2013 0.45 respectively. We note however this is a simplification, as Hii regions contain temperature gradients and complex ionization structures (e.g. Wang\net al. 2004; Dopita et al. 2006b; Kewley et al. 2019b). In addition the [Sii] lines cannot probe high densities because collisional de-excitation dominates above 104cm\u22123 where the ratio saturates at \u223c0.45, its asymptotic value (e.g. Davies et al. 2020). To measure the integrated electron density for each galaxy, we take the [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 ratio as reported in Table 1 and apply the conversion to electron density. We detect the [Sii] lines in 19 KURVSCDFS galaxies with [Sii] S/N\u22652. The Kewley et al. (2019b) model places theoretical constraints on the emission-line ratios, requiring them to be between 0.45 \u2264 [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 \u2264 1.45. We therefore exclude the 10 galaxies that lie outside of these theoretical limits (8 with [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731>1.45, 2 with [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731<0.454). The median \ud835\udc5be of the remaining 12 KURVS-CDFS galaxies is log10(\ud835\udc5be[cm\u22123]) = 2.29\u00b1 0.25 at amedian redshift of \ud835\udc67 = 1.39\u00b1 0.07 In Figure 4 we plot the electron density of the KURVS-CDFS galaxies as a function of their spectroscopic redshift as well the electron density measurements from individual galaxies in the KGES comparison sample. In addition to the KMOS samples we also include a number of comparison samples derived from either the [Oii]\ud835\udf063726/\ud835\udf063729 and [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 for both stacked and individual spectra, calibrated to the Kewley et al. (2019b) model by Davies et al. (2021). The electron density within the KURVS-CDFS galaxies agrees with comparison studies, with a higher electron density at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5 than in the local Universe. The KMOS samples are coloured by their integrated [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc, a proxy for the ionization parameter, however no distinct trend with redshift or electron density is identified. As well as a cosmic evolution in the electron density of the interstellar medium, studies have shown that the electron density may correlate with the galaxies main-sequence properties (e.g. Shimakawa et al. 2015; Kaasinen et al. 2017; Davies et al. 2021)whilst other studies conflict these results, finding no such correlations (e.g. Yabe et al. 2015; Onodera et al. 2016; Sanders et al. 2016). In Figure 5 we first plot the median [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 ratio of the KURVS-CDFS galaxies, and comparison samples, as a function of the median redshift, coloured by their gas-phase metalliciy derived using the D16 calibration. On average the KURVS-CDFS galaxies have similar electron density and gas-phase metallicity to the other comparison samples at this epoch (see Table 2). We then correlate the individual galaxies [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 ratios with their their stellar mass, H\ud835\udefc star-formation rate and H\ud835\udefc specific star-formation rate. The galaxies are coloured by their integrated gasphase metallicity following the D16 calibration. We include comparison samples from Kashino et al. (2017) FMOS-COSMOS and Yabe et al. (2015) the Subaru FMOS Galaxy Redshift Survey as well as the KGES comparison sample. The [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 is plotted as opposed to the \ud835\udc5be to remove the theoretical constrains of the Kewley et al. (2019b) model, allowing more galaxies to be included in the sample. We note the electron density shown for the KMOS galaxies represents individual galaxy measurements, whilst both comparison samples are derived from spectra stacked in stellar mass bins. For both the KURVS-CDFS sample and full sample (KURVSCDFS + literature samples), we identify no significant correlations in all three panels as indicated by the black and grey spearman rank correlations shown in each panel respectively. We further identify no connection with between the integrated gas-phase metallicity and [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 ratio of the galaxies. However we note the KURVS sample does not cover a large range in stellar mass and star-formation rate, and thus may lead to a lack of correlation.\n4 The [Sii] lines in KURVS 2 and 19 are heavily affected by OH skylines\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/m nras/stac580/6543716 by D TU Library user on 15 M arch 2022\nO R IG\nIN A\nL U\nN E D\nIT E D\nM A\nN U\nS C\nR IP\nT"

            "text": "The local galaxy population is well defined by a number of well studied scaling relations that interconnect the fundamental properties of galaxies (e.g. Fall & Romanowsky 2013, 2018; Curti et al. 2020a). The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) between galaxy stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity and star-formation rate prescribes the relation between the chemical abundance of the interstellar medium gas, ongoing star formation and stellar mass build up. The spatially\nresolved nature of the fundamental metallicity relation is less well defined especially at high redshift. To resolve the FMR within the KURVS-CDFS sample, we require spatially resolved stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation maps. The metallicity and star-formation maps can be derived from the integral field KMOS data, whilst we derive the stellar mass maps fromhigh-resolutionCANDELS imaging of theKURVS-CDFS sample. Using the deep multi-wavelength broadband HST imaging from 0.43 \u2013 1.6\ud835\udf07m, Dudzevi\u010diu\u0304te\u0307 in. prep. perform pixel-to-pixel SED fitting. To do so we re-binned all of the HST data to 0.18 arcseconds, to approximately match the PSF FWHM of the longest wavelength (\ud835\udc3b-band) data. From this matched-resolution imaging, the sextractor software was used to perform pixel photometry and stellar mass maps were constructed using using the magphys (da Cunha et al. 2015) SED fitting code (Dudzeviciute et al in prep). Dudzevi\u010diu\u0304te\u0307 et al. (2019) confirmed that the spatially resolved stellar mass values of galaxies in the CANDELS field are consistent with integrated values. To derive the gas-phase metallicity maps for each galaxy we convert the [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio derived in each pixel (see Figure 6), following the adaptive binning emission-line fitting procedure (see P22), to a gas-phase Oxygen abundance using the M13 calibration. We opt for the M13 calibration as we do not have sufficient S/N in the [Sii] lines to spatially resolve them. The H\ud835\udefc star-formation rate map is derived by converting the observed H\ud835\udefc flux in each pixel to a extinction corrected H\ud835\udefc star-formation rate, following the same procedures as in Section 2 but using each pixels magphys derived \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc49 to correct for dust-extinction.

We re-bin the KMOS data, that is sampled at 0.10 arcseconds per pixel, to be 0.18 arcsecond per pixel. In doing so the flux in the KMOS data is conserved.

The KMOS PSF is derived from the standard star frames in the KMOS observations. Re-binning the KMOS data to a larger pixel scale results in the loss of pixels at the edges due to contamination with lower S/N pixels. We remove these contaminated pixels as well pixels from the stellar mass map with poorly constrained stellar masses due to uncertainties in the SED fitting. With the HST stellar mass maps of the galaxies on the same scale as the kinematic KMOS data, we align theHST data with the KMOS data using deep H-band continuum images. Having aligned and rescaled the data to a homogeneous resolution, we can now analyse the spatially resolved correlations in the KURVS-CDFS sample. In Figure 6 we show examples of theHST multi-band imaging and spatially resolvedKMOSdata for theKURVS-CDFSgalaxies.

The semi-major axis of the galaxy (orange line) and stellar continuum centre (black filled circle) are indicated, as well as the morphological classification from Huertas-Company et al. (2015). In panels b and c we show the spatially resolved stellar mass map and [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc map with the FWHM of the PSF in HST and KMOS observations (black dashed circle) respectively. We display the pixel-based gas-phase metallicity (blue points) as a function of radius and linear fit (crimson line) with reported slope and uncertainty in the final panel d. We also show the annuli-based metallicity (black squares) and corresponding annuli-based gradient (green line) with slope and uncertainty. The full KURVS-CDFS sample is shown in Appendix A To convert the stellar mass and star-formation rate maps to a stellar\nmass surface density and star-formation rate surface density maps, we divide each pixels stellar mass (or star-formation rate) by the physical area of each pixel. In Figure 7 we plot the gas-phase metallicity in each pixel as a function of the stellar mass surface density of the pixel coloured the pixels star-formation rate surface density. A running median (and standard deviation) in stellar mass surface density is shown by the black squares, where each bin contains 300 pixels. Each bin is coloured by the median star-formation rate surface density in that bin. We also perform a linear orthogonal distance regression fit to the resolved FMR of the form 12 + log(O/H) = \ud835\udefc log10 (\u03a3\u2217) + \ud835\udefd, deriving \ud835\udefc = 0.09 \u00b1 0.01 and \ud835\udefd = 8.35 \u00b1 0.01. We note the choice of pixel scale does not influence the derived scaling relations with a consistent relation derived when using a pixel scale comparable to the KMOS PSF. In addition we show the relations for the MUSE Atlas of Disks survey at \ud835\udc67 < 0.013 from Erroz-Ferrer et al. (2019) (grey solid line and shaded region), the MANGA survey from Barrera-Ballesteros et al.

We convert metallicity of Erroz-Ferrer et al. (2019) observational sample to the M13 calibration using the conversion of Scudder et al. (2021). The derived relation for the KURVS-CDFS galaxies is in close agreement with the comparison samples, with higher stellar-mass surface density regions having higher gas-phase metallicity.

The data is coloured by the pixel-to-pixel H\ud835\udefc derived star-formation rate surface density (log10(\u03a3H\ud835\udefc [M\u2299yr\u22121pc\u22122])). We perform a orthogonal distance regression fit to the relation (orange line) identifying a slope of \ud835\udefc = 0.09 \u00b1 0.01 and \ud835\udefd = 8.35 \u00b1 0.01, as well as showing the running median (and standard deviation) in X with 300 pixels per bin (black squares and errorbars). Each bin is coloured by the median star-formation rate surface density in the bin. The relations from the MUSE Atlas of Disks survey at \ud835\udc67 < 0.013 (Erroz-Ferrer et al. 2019) (grey solid line and shaded region), the MANGA survey from Barrera-Ballesteros et al.

We convert metallicity of Erroz-Ferrer et al. (2019) sample to the M13 calibration using the conversion of Scudder et al. (2021). The inset panel shows the running median and comparison samples, where the running medians are coloured by the median rpix/\ud835\udc45h in each bin. The derived relation for the KURVS-CDFS galaxies indicates higher stellar-mass surface density regions having higher gas-phase metallicity and is comparable to the low-redshift comparison samples with on average 0.05\u00b1 0.01 dex higher metallicity for a given stellar mass surface density. The higher star-formation rate surface density pixels have a lower gas-phase metallicity for a given stellar mass surface density, indicating the presence of the FMR.

However, the evolution of rMZR with redshift is in contrast to the evolution in the integrated MZR (Figure 2) for the KURVS-CDFS sample, where for a given stellar mass, high-redshift galaxies have a lower metallicity. Trayford & Schaye (2019) identified a strong evolution of 0.4 dex in metallicity at a stellar mass density of 102 M\u2217pc\u22122 between \ud835\udc67 = 0.1 and \ud835\udc67 = 2. For the same range of stellar mass surface density, we identify an average offset to higher metallicity of \u2248 0.12 dex than that predicted by Trayford & Schaye (2019) at \ud835\udc67 = 1 which may be driven by the choice of metallicity calibration.\nFor a given stellar mass surface density in Figure 7, the higher star-formation rate surface density pixels appear to have a lower gasphase metallicity. To investigate this correlation further, in Figure 8 we correlate the residuals to the orthogonal distance regression fit in Figure 7 with the star formation rate surface density of the pixels in different stellar mass surface density bins.\nWe perform a orthogonal distance regression fit to the relation identifying a slope of \ud835\udefc = \u22120.0901 \u00b1 0.025, 0.003 \u00b1 0.028, 0.034 \u00b1 0.024, and \ud835\udefd = \u22120.498 \u00b1 0.148, \u22120.011 \u00b1 0.170, 0.194 \u00b1 0.137 for the low, medium and high stellar mass surface density bins respectively.

This anti-correlation between star formation rate surface density and gas-phase metallicity residual is not present in the medium or higher stellar mass surface density bins, reflecting the predicted flattening in the rFMR. This is in agreement with that observed at low redshift (e.g. Cresci et al. 2019) and indicates the presence of the rFMR in the KURVS-CDFS sample, as shown in Figure 7.

There is an indication of a correlation between the radial location of the pixels and their metallicity, with highest metallicity located in the inner regions of the galaxies. This maybe due to the \u2018inside-out\u2019 secular evolution of the galaxies (e.g. S\u00e1nchez et al. 2014; Sch\u00f6nrich & McMillan 2017; Zewdie et al. 2020; Wang & Lilly 2021). However, this is averaged over the whole sample so in order to understand this relation further we now analyse the gas-phase metallicity gradients in individual galaxies. We note however this may also be driven by shocks and AGN contamination in the central regions."

            "text": "A negative abundance gradient (metallicity decreasing with radius) has been commonly observed in low-redshift main-sequence starforming galaxies (e.g. Belfiore et al. 2017; Sharda et al. 2021a; Lutz et al. 2021) and is theorised to be a clear signature of the \u2018insideout\u2019 secular evolution of galaxies. The abundance gradients in highredshift galaxies, however, are less well constrained with a studies reporting a range of abundance gradients (e.g. Cresci et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2013; Wuyts et al. 2016; Curti et al. 2020b). The challenge at high-redshift is the lower S/N and surface brightness of the galaxies, making it difficult to accurately measure emission-line ratios. To achieve the required S/N, one common technique is to stack the spectra from integral field observations inside an annulus. The annuli are spaced apart by the PSF of the observations and aligned to galaxies kinematic position angle and morphological axis ratio (e.g. Wuyts et al. 2016; Curti et al. 2020a; Gillman et al. 2021). We can then measure the emission-line ratios from the\nstacked spectra in each annulus, giving two or three measurements of the gas-phase metallicity as a function of radius for each galaxy. In this way large numbers of metallicity gradient measurements can be made in distant galaxies with lower S/N spectra. (e.g. Wuyts et al. 2016; F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2018; Gillman et al. 2021). For the KURVS-CDFS sample we measure the annuli-based metallicity gradients utilising the M13 strong-line calibration (Section 3.1) and the methods of Gillman et al. (2021). In short we sum the spectra in the velocity-subtracted data cubes from elliptical annuli whose semimajor axes are multiplies of the half-light radius of the KMOS PSF. If three measurements of the [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio can be made with a H\ud835\udefc S/N>3 in each annulus, the metallicity gradient is measured. We derive a median metallicity gradient of \u0394Z/\u0394R = \u22120.0052\u00b1 0.0018 dex kpc\u22121. The PSF of the KMOS observations acts to flatten the observed metallicity gradients. To correct for this and attain an intrinsic metallicity gradient for each galaxy, we apply a beam-smearing correction to the gradients. The beam-smearing correction is a function of galaxy size (\ud835\udc45h), relative to the FWHM of the observations, and galaxy axis ratio and was derived from modelling of mock galaxies with varying intrinsic gradients, continuum sizes and PSFs (see Gillman 2020; Gillman et al. 2021). For the KURVS-CDFS sample we derive a median beam-smearing correction of \ud835\udc36BS = 0.32\u00b1 0.05 andmedian intrinsicmetallicity gradient of\u0394Z/\u0394R = \u22120.015\u00b1 0.005 dex kpc\u22121. Recent studies have indicated connections between a galaxies gasphase metallicity gradient and its fundamental properties such as stellar mass and stellar continuum half-light radius (e.g. Hemler et al. 2021; Sharda et al. 2021a,c,b; Boardman et al. 2021; Franchetto et al. 2021). To analyse this correlation in the KURVS-CDFS sample, in Figure 9 we correlate the intrinsic annuli-based metallicity gradients with the galaxies stellar mass.

The KURVS-CDFS galaxies have similar gas-phase metallicity gradients for given stellar mass as the low-redshift comparison samples becoming flatter at higher masses.

The black dashed line indicates a one to inverse one relation . We identify an anti-correlation whereby a galaxy with a positive gas-phase metallicity has a negative gradient in [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 (electron density).\nhydrodynamical simulations at redshift snapshots \ud835\udc67 = 0, 1, 2 (Hemler et al. 2021). The intrinsic metallicity gradients of the KURVS-CDFS galaxies exhibit a similar correlation to the comparison samples, with flatter (or inverted)metallicity gradients at higher stellarmass. Sharda et al. (2021a) predict that the up turn to flatter gradients is driven by the galaxies transitioning from an advection-dominated evolution (i.e re-distribution of metals) to a accretion-dominated evolution at higher stellar masses. Boardman et al. (2021) identify a variation in the metallicity gradient of galaxies across the stellar mass - stellar continuum half-light radii plane. They establish that smaller galaxies have flatter gradients than larger galaxies for a given stellar mass. In Figure 9 we colour the galaxies by their stellar continuum half-light radius (\ud835\udc45h) however in the KURVS-CDFS sample no clear trend with galaxy size is seen. In addition to the radial variations in the gas-phase metallicity, other interstellar medium have been identified in local galaxies to correlate with radius. Studies have shown that galaxies have clumps or gradients in electron density (e.g. Binette et al. 2002; Phillips 2007; Herrera-Camus et al. 2016) which brings into question the assumption of fixed electron density when inferring the properties of the interstellar medium (e.g. metallicity). To analyse the spatial variation in electron density in the KURVS-CDFS sample, we measure the [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 in annuli in order to increase the [Sii] S/N. Using the de-redshifted KMOS data cubes we apply the same method as for measuring the annuli-based metallicity gradients but this time measure [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 in each annulus. We require S/N>2 for the weaker [Sii] in each annuli and derive a median intrinsic [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 gradient for the 11 galaxies that fulfil this criteria of \u0394([Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731)/\u0394\ud835\udc5f = \u22120.007\u00b1 0.034 dex kpc\u22121.\nIn Figure 9 we correlate the intrinsic [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 gradients with the intrinsic annuli-derived metallicity gradients using the M13 calibration. We perform an orthogonal distance regression fit (crimson line) of the form \u0394Z/\u0394R=\ud835\udefc ([Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731)/\u0394\ud835\udc5f+ \ud835\udefd deriving \ud835\udefc = \u22120.18\u00b1 0.08 and \ud835\udefd = \u22120.0015\u00b1 0.004. A negative correlation with a spearman rank coefficient of \ud835\udc5fs =\u22120.31, \ud835\udc5ds = 0.39 is observed, suggesting an anti-correlation between the electron density and metallicity gradient. In this instance galaxies with negative abundance gradients have positive gradients in electron density. This brings into question the use of strong-line calibrations that assume a fixed electron density in the interstellar medium. Variations in electron density maybe caused by variations in star-formation rate, midplane and feedback pressures of the interstellar medium as well as variations in molecular hydrogen density (e.g. Kakkad et al. 2018; Davies et al. 2020, 2021). However larger samples are required to confirm this correlation at higher significance."

In each panel we report the spearman rank (\ud835\udc5fs, \ud835\udc5ds) values, identifying only a negative correlation with star-formation surface density, whereby the metallicity profiles of galaxies with higher star-formation rate surface density have less deviation from a linear profile.\nMenguiano et al. 2018; S\u00e1nchez et al. 2021; Li et al. 2021; Metha et al. 2021) and at high-redshift (e.g. F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2018; Curti et al. 2020a) with connections to the galaxies morphology and kinematic state. To analyse the non-linearity of the abundance profiles in high-redshift star-forming galaxies we use the spatially resolved [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc emission-line maps derived in P22 (Figure 6). Correlating the metallicity of each pixel with its de-projected radius, we define a pixel-based metallicity gradient for each galaxy, deriving a median gradient of of \u0394Z/\u0394R = \u22120.0025\u00b1 0.0010 dex kpc\u22121 for the sample.\nFor each galaxy we subtract off the linear pixel-based metallicity gradient and define the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the residuals; where a larger MAD indicates a larger derivation from\nthe linear abundance profile. The median MAD from a linear abundance profile for KURVS-CDFS sample is MAD = 0.07\u00b1 0.01 dex with a 16th \u2013 84th percentile range of 0.04 \u2013 0.10 dex. To analyse the correlation between the metallicity deviations from linearity and the galaxies properties we use the KMOS data to quantify the galaxies kinematic properties as well as the CANDELS HST imaging to constrain the morphological properties of the galaxies.\nThe shape of the stellar continuum light profile was quantified by van der Wel et al. (2014) who used the 1.6\ud835\udf07m HST imaging to constrain the S\u00e9rsic index of the CANDELS galaxies. Fitting S\u00e9rsic profiles with the galfit software to 10 arcsecond cutouts of the galaxies they established a median S\u00e9rsic index of \ud835\udc5b = 1.23\u00b1 0.21\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/m nras/stac580/6543716 by D TU Library user on 15 M arch 2022\nO R IG\nIN A\nL U\nN E D\nIT E D\nM A\nN U\nS C\nR IP\nT"

            "text": "for the KURVS-CDFS galaxies. In addition we have use the bulge to total (B/T) ratios for the KURVS-CDFS galaxies from Dimauro et al. (2018), who used the multi-wavelengthHST data to decompose each galaxy into its bulge and disc components. From this sample, the KURVS-CDFS galaxies have a median bulge to total ratio of B/T = 0.27\u00b1 0.12 i.e predominantly disc-dominated. A visual classification of the galaxies was carried out by HuertasCompany et al. (2015), usingmachine learning to distinguish between Discs, Compact and Irregular galaxies. Following this classification the KURVS-CDFS sample is composed of 12 Discs, 9 Irregular and 3 Compact galaxies. In Figure 10 we correlate the MAD of the metallicity profiles with the S\u00e9rsic index, B/T, colouring the galaxies by their Hubble morphology (Compact, Disc, Irregular). We also correlate the median absolute deviation of the residuals to the linear abundance profiles with the galaxies H\ud835\udefc star-formation rate surface density (\u03a3SFR) and kinematic state (\ud835\udc63H\ud835\udefc/\ud835\udf0eH\ud835\udefc) derived from the KMOS observations (see P22 for details). In Figure 10 we only identify a negative correlation between the deviation from a linear metallicity profile and the \u03a3SFR with spearman rank coefficients of \ud835\udc5fs =\u22120.40, \ud835\udc5ds = 0.07. This implies that although there are clear azimuthal variations in the metallicity of the interstellar medium in high-redshift galaxies (Figure 6), they are not necessarily connected to the galaxies restframe optical morphology or kinematic properties of the galaxies but are more related to the concentration of ongoing star formation. At a fixed galaxy integrated SFRH\ud835\udefc, larger galaxies have more deviation from a linear abundance gradient, whilst for a fixed size, galaxies with lower star-formation rates also have a larger deviation from a linear gradient. To visualise this in Figure 10, the size of the data points reflect the stellar continuum size of the galaxies. A similar connection between azimuthal variations in gas-phase metallicity and main-sequence properties was identified by Li et al. (2021) in the local Universe, with no correlation with galaxies kinematics or morphology. To investigate further, we derive the residuals in metallicity, stellar mass surface density and star formation rate surface density to their respective linear profiles as a function of radius for the KURVSCDFS sample.We identify no correlation between the residuals of the metallicity profiles and the stellar mass surface density and star formation rate surface density residuals with \ud835\udc5f = 0.0360, \ud835\udc5d = 0.1137, and \ud835\udc5f = \u22120.0267, \ud835\udc5d = 0.2409 respectively. Defining the MAD at each radius we can construct the MAD radial profile for metallicity, stellar mass surface density and star formation rate surface density residuals. All three MAD profiles show an increase with radius (see Appendix B), indicating larger deviations from linear profiles at larger radii. However, the variations in the MAD of the residuals to the stellar mass surface density and star formation rate surface density profiles are not reflected in the MAD of the metallicity profile. This indicates that deviations from a linear metallicity gradient are not correlated with deviations from a linear stellar mass surface density or star formation rate surface density profile, at the same radius."

            "text": "In this paper we have analysed the interstellar medium properties of 22 star-forming galaxies from the first half of the KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity Survey (KURVS) which comprises of sources in the CDFS field (KURVS-CDFS). KURVS-CDFS galaxies have a medium redshift of \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.39. We demonstrate the galaxies are representative of the galaxy main-sequence at this epoch with a median stellar mass, H\ud835\udefc derived star-formation rate and stel-\nlar continuum half-light radius of log10(\ud835\udc40\u2217[\ud835\udc40\u2299]) = 10.10\u00b1 0.09, SFRH\ud835\udefc[M\u2299yr\u22121] = 24\u00b1 6 and, \ud835\udc45h[kpc] = 3.28\u00b1 0.42 respectively. Our main conclusions are;\n\u2022 The stellar mass \u2013 gas-phase metallicity relation is in place in the sample with the galaxies exhibiting integrated gas-phase metallicity values expected for this epoch with a median value of 12+log(O/H)M13 = 8.40\u00b1 0.03. We establish galaxies with higher [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio show closer agreement between the Dopita et al. (2016) [Nii]/[Sii] based metallicity calibration and Marino et al. (2013) [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc calibration, especially at high metallicity (Figure 3). Whilst at low metallicity the integrated [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio of the galaxies shows no correlation with the offset between the metallicity indicators.\n\u2022 We quantify the electron density in the galaxies using the [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 ratio. Of the 12 galaxies with 0.45 \u2264 [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 \u2264 1.45 we derive a median value of log10(\ud835\udc5be[cm\u22123]) = 2.29\u00b1 0.25. We demonstrate the electron density within the sample is elevated in comparison to local galaxies in agreement with other high-redshift studies. However, we find no correlation with the ionization parameter (as traced by the integrated [Sii]/H\ud835\udefc ratio) (Figure 4) as well as no correlation between the galaxies main-sequence properties (e.g stellar mass, star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate) and electron density (Figure 5).\n\u2022 Exploiting the high S/N spatially resolved KMOS andHST data (Figure 6) we define the resolved fundamental metallicity relation (rFMR) at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5 identifying the correlation between gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass surface density and H\ud835\udefc star-formation rate surface density (Figure 7). We find a 0.05\u00b1 0.01 dex evolution in the normalisation of the relation compared to the local Universe as well as identifying variation in the gas-phase metallicity as a function of radial position.\n\u2022 We define stellar mass gas-phase metallicity gradient relation in the KURVS-CDFS sample, identifying flatter metallicity gradient at higher stellar masses as found by low redshift studies (Figure 9). We further define the relation between the [Sii]\ud835\udf066716/\ud835\udf066731 ratio (electron density) gradient and gas-phase metallicity gradient in the galaxies establishing a spearman rank coefficient of \ud835\udc5fs =\u22120.31, \ud835\udc5ds = 0.39, suggesting an anti-correlation between the electron density andmetallicity gradient. In this instance galaxies with negative abundance gradients have positive gradients in electron density, however larger samples are required to confirmed this at higher significance.\n\u2022 Finally we examine the non-linearity of the abundance profiles using the spatially-resolved [Nii]/H\ud835\udefcmaps, identifying evidence for azimuthal variations in metallicity which show a negative correlation with galaxy integrated star-formation rate surface density (\ud835\udc5fs =\u22120.40, \ud835\udc5ds = 0.07). However, no correlation is identified with the galaxies morphological and kinematic properties (Figure 10) We further identify no connection between deviations from a linear metallicity profile and the deviations from a linear stellar mass surface density or star formation rate surface density profile (see Appendix B). Thus indicating that radial variations in metallicity are not connected to the radial variations in stellar mass or star formation but correlate with the global density of star-formation as traced by the H\ud835\udefc emission-line.\nOverall we have shown that KURVS-CDFS sample at \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5 is composed of main-sequence galaxies which follow the galaxyintegrated scaling relations observed at low redshift, between stellar mass, stellar continuum size, star-formation rate and gas-phase metallicity. Whilst their spatially-resolved interstellar medium properties indicate both radial and azimuthal variations. Consequently, the prescriptions used to define the fundamental properties of low-\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/m nras/stac580/6543716 by D TU Library user on 15 M arch 2022\nO R IG\nIN A\nL U\nN E D\nIT E D\nM A\nN U\nS C\nR IP\nT\nResolved ISM Properties within \ud835\udc67 \u2248 1.5 SFGs 17\nredshift galaxies may not always be applicable at high-redshift due to variations in interstellar medium properties (e.g. electron density, ionisation parameter and variations in the ionising source) which can be quantified by future observations with JWST."

Examples of the HST multi-band imaging and spatially resolved KMOS data for the KURVS-CDFS galaxies. For each galaxy we show a WFC3 three-colour image composed of F105W, F125W and F160W images with the KMOS field of view (blue square) overlaid (a). The semi-major axis of the galaxy (orange line) and stellar continuum centre (black filled circle) are indicated, as well as the morphological classification from Huertas-Company et al. (2015). The spatially resolved stellar mass map (b) and [Nii]/H\ud835\udefc map (c) are shown with the FWHM of the PSF in HST and KMOS observations (black dashed circle) respectively. In the final panel (d), we display the pixel-based gas-phase metallicity (blue points) as a function of radius and linear fit (crimson line) with reported slope and uncertainty. We also show the annuli-based metallicity (black squares) and corresponding annuli-based gradient (green line) with slope and uncertainty. The examples indicate the range of morphologies and metallicity profiles in addition to the KMOS data quality.\nAPPENDIX B: MEDIAN ABSOLUTE DEVIATION (MAD) PROFILES\nTo further investigate the deviations from a linear abundance profile in the KURVS-CDFS galaxies, we define the radial profiles in each galaxy for metallicity, stellar mass surface density and star formation rate surface density. Performing a linear profile to each profile, for each galaxy, we define the residuals to each profile. Taking the sample as we whole, we then define the MAD of the residuals as a function of radius.\nIn Figure B1 we show the MAD as function of radius for metallicity, stellar mass surface density and star formation rate surface density. All three MAD profiles show an increase with radius, indicating larger deviations from linear profiles at larger radii. However, the variations in the MAD of the residuals to the stellar mass surface density and star formation rate surface density profiles are not reflected in the MAD of the metallicity profile. This indicates that deviations from a linear metallicity gradient are not correlated with deviations from a linear stellar mass surface density or star formation rate surface density profile, at the same radius.\n0 2 4 6 8 10 Radius [R/Rh]\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\nM ed\nia n\nAb so\nlu te\nD ev\nia tio\nn (M\nAD )\nMetallicity log10( H ) log10( * )\nFigure B1. The median absolute deviation (MAD) of the residuals as a function of radius for the metallicity, stellar mass surface density and star formation rate surface density profiles in the KURVS-CDFS sample. Each radial bins contains 300 pixels. All three profiles show an increase in MAD with radius. The variations in stellar mass surface density residual MAD are reflected in the star formation rate surface MAD but not in the metallicity MAD profile. This indicates that deviations from a linear metallicity gradient are not correlated with deviations from a linear stellar mass surface density or star formation rate surface density profile, at the same radius.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/m nras/stac580/6543716 by D TU Library user on 15 M arch 2022"
