    "abstractText": "Hard carbon materials are considered to be the most practical anode materials for sodium ion batteries because of the rich availability of their resources and potentially low cost. Here, the conversion of corn leaf biomass, a largely available agricultural waste, into carbonaceous materials for Na-ion storage application is reported. Thermal analysis investigation determines the presence of exothermic events occurring during the thermal treatment of the biomass. Accordingly, various temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 \u25e6C are selected to perform carbonization treatment trials, leading to the formation of various biocarbons. The materials obtained are characterized by a combination of methods, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, surface evaluation, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterizations. The Na-ion storage performances of these materials are investigated using water-soluble carboxymethyl cellulose binder, highlighting the influence of the carbonization temperature on the electrochemical performance of biocarbons. Moreover, the influence of post-mechanochemical treatment on the Na-ion storage performance of biocarbons is studied through kinetic evaluations. It is confirmed that reducing the particle sizes and increasing the carbon purity of biocarbons and the formation of gel polymeric networks would improve the Na-ion storage capacity, as well as the pseudocapacitive contribution to the total current. At a high-current density of 500 mA g\u22121, a specific Na-ion storage capacity of 134 mAh g\u22121 is recorded on the biocarbon prepared at 600 \u25e6C, followed by ball-milling and washing treatment, exhibiting a reduced charge transfer resistance of 49 \u03a9 and an improved Na-ion diffusion coefficient of 4.8 \u00d7 10\u221219 cm2 s\u22121. This article proposes a simple and effective technique for the preparation of low-cost biocarbons to be used as the anode of Na-ion batteries.",

Although mainstream energy storage systems are currently based on lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the development of alternative systems, such as sodium ion batteries (SIBs), are becoming significantly important due to the foreseeable obstacles associated with LIBs [3,4]. Among them, the supply of lithium resources may be exhausted in future due to the widespread electrification of various sectors [5]. Consequently, the development of simple and effective ways of preparing materials for Na-ion storage applications is of significant scientific and commercial importance. In particular, commercial SIBs require low-cost anode materials [6\u20138] with extensive availability of resources, non-toxicity, and specific electrochemical characteristics, such as sufficiently low Na-ion insertion/extraction potentials and high specific capacity. Among various materials evaluated as the anode of SIBs, hard carbons may provide the specifications mentioned above; therefore, they have become the most widely characterized anode materials\nGels 2023, 9, 701. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9090701 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 701 2 of 17\nfor NIBs, with the highest possibility of commercialization [9,10]. Disordered pseudographitized and defective domains in such hard carbons provide an efficient platform for Na insertion/extraction. Among hard carbons, those extracted from environment-friendly and low-cost biomass waste can be highly desirable choices [11]. Therefore, biomass wastes such as coconut shells, walnut shells, and corn silk [12] have been used as the carbon source for the preparation of hard carbons for Na-ion storage. The carbonization of such materials is performed by grinding the biomass, followed by thermal annealing under an inert atmosphere (Ar) to 1300 \u25e6C with a dwell time of around 1 h, and washing with HCl solutions for several hours to remove impurities [12]. Zhu et al. [13] carbonized corn pods at 700 \u25e6C for 2 h under N2 gas, followed by washing with HCl solutions and treating with a mixture of Cu(NO3)3, Co(NO3)2, NH4F, and urea at 120 \u25e6C (8 h) to prepare a CuCo2O4/corn pod structure, which was subsequently used as the anode of SIBs. To fabricate such electrodes, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is often used as the binder; therefore, the utilization of organic solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) becomes inevitable due to the lack of solubility of PVDF in water. Due to the toxic nature of NMP, the utilization of water-soluble binders such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) would be of significant environmental and economic importance. It should be mentioned that, in aqueous slurries, carbon particles tend to aggregate with each other due to their hydrophobicity, reducing the homogeneity of the slurry. The addition of CMC can induce the dispersion of the carbon particles by adsorbing onto the carbon surfaces, while the remaining CMC can form gel polymeric networks [14]. Park et al. [15] studied the influence of CMC binder on rheological properties of anode slurries made of carbon materials, and found that, at sufficiently high concentrations, CMC acts as both a dispersant and a gelling agent, forming a fibrillar network. Other observations suggest that the gelatinization behavior of CMC and alternative water-soluble binders such as guar gum influences the electrochemical performance of anodes used in metal-ion cells [16]. On the other hand, despite its availability, corn leaf waste has not been used as the precursor material for Na-ion storage applications, while some other applications have been studied using corn leaf waste. For example, Amer et al. [17] used Jordanian corn leaf waste through pyrolysis at 300\u2013450 \u25e6C under nitrogen to prepare biofuels. Corn leaf can also be considered as an interesting source to fabricate Na-ion storage materials. However, considering that the application of corn leaf waste for the preparation of anode materials for SIBs has not been investigated in the literature, this study aims at studying the effect of carbonization temperature and mechanochemical activation on Na-ion storage performance of corn leaf. It provides experimental evidence on the feasibility of utilizing such a highly available biomass for Na-ion storage application through mild processing conditions, without unitizing potentially problematic/toxic chemicals, using a watersoluble CMC binder."

In comparison with these samples, the morphology of the C600 sample subjected to ball-milling and washing treatment (C600B) is different, in that the particle sizes are substantially reduced to typically less than 20 \u00b5m, while the textured particles could no longer be observed (Figure 7). The fragmented particles are indicative of a high-energy ball-milling process [30], which can be beneficial in Na-ion storage application due to the shortening of the Na+ diffusion paths and increasing the storage active sites, thus promoting the electrochemical performance of the material [31].

It is evident that the specific capacity of biocarbons is affected by the carbonization temperature, which is in agreement with the thermal analysis results shown in Figure 2. In the DSC curve shown in Figure 2, th exothermic temperature of 445 \u25e6C was mentioned to be indicative of the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups, the lignin decomposition, and the reorganization of the carbon structure. As shown in Figure 9, the Na-ion storage performance of C400, obtained by the thermal treatment of the biomass at 400 \u25e6C (below the critical temperature of 445 \u25e6C), is lower than those of C500 and C600, obtained at 500 and 600 \u25e6C, respectively. This improvement can be rela ed to the development of dis rdered graphi ic structu e at greater temperatures, providing further active sites to accommodate Na-ions [35]. Moreover, as can be observed in Figure 9a, the specific capacity of C600B is greater than that of other samples, which is related to the higher carbon purity and lower particles sizes in this sample.

In the DSC curve shown in Figure 2, the exothermic temperature of 445 \u00b0C was mentioned to be indicative of the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups, the lignin decomposition, and the reorganization of the carbon structure. As shown in Figure 9, the Na-ion storage performance of C400, obtained by the thermal treatment of the biomass at 400 \u00b0C (below the critical temperature of 445 \u00b0C), is lower than those of C500 and C600, obtained at 500 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. This improvement can be related to the development of disordered graphitic structure at greater temperatures, providing further active sites to accommodate Na-ions [35]. Moreover, as can be observed in Figure 9a, the specific capacity of C600B is greater than that of other samples, which is related to the higher carbon purity and lower particles sizes in this sample. Figure 9b shows the rate performances of C400, C500, C600, and C600B under various current densities of 100 to 5000 mA g\u22121, and the results obtained are summarized in Table 2, providing evidence for the greater electrochemical performance of C600B.\nFigure 9.

Table 3 summarizes the extracted information, including the electrolyte resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) [40]. As shown, the values of Rs and Rct recorded on C600B are lower than those of the C600, while the Na-ion diffusion coefficient of the C600B is greater than that of the C600, which is consistent with the greater cycling performance of the earlier. This highlights the effect brough about by the mechanical milling and washing process.\nGels 2023, 9, 701 11 of 17"

            "text": "To analyze the Na-ion storage performance of C600B, the CV curves of the material were evaluated at 0.01\u20133.0 V vs. Na+/Na at scan rates varying from 0.2\u20131.0 mV s\u22121, as shown in Figure 11a. As observed, the enclosed area in the CV curve increases with the increase of the scanning rate. This observation can be explained by the fact that, at higher scan rates, more ions reach the electrode/electrolyte interface, increasing the capacitive current, whereas limited ions participate in the charge-transfer reaction. In addition, the positions of the reduction/oxidation peaks do not change at various scanning rates, indicating the reversibility [41] of sodium ion insertion/extraction into/out of C600B. The variation of scanning rates and corresponding peak currents can be used to evaluate the pseudocapacitance contribution to the total current at different scan rates. The diffusionbased behavior of the electrode implies that the peak current (i) changes linearly with the square root of the scan rate (v1/2). However, if the peak current varies linearly with the scan rate, the process can be assumed to be based on pseudocapacitive behavior. The correlativity between i (current intensity) and v (sweeping rate) can be based on the following equations [42,43]:\ni = avb (2)\nlog i = log (a) + b \u00d7 log (v) (3) Gels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 18\nIn Equation (2), i is the peak current. The terms a and b represent dimensionless variables, and v is the scan rate. If b = 0.5, the current response is diffusion-controlled. If the b value is 1, the electrochemical process is based on a pseudocapacitive event. Figure 11b shows the values of log i vs. log v, where the slope of lines corresponding to peak 1 (cathodic event) and peak 2 (anodic event) could be calculated to be 0.80 and 0.56, respectively. This indicates that the cathodic peak is generated mainly based on a pseudocapacitive process, while the anodic event is mainly based on a diffusion process [44]. In addition, Equation (2) can be expressed as follows [45]:\ni = k1v + k2v1/2 (4)\n/ = k1v1/2 + k2 (5)\nwhere k1v and k2v1/2 correspond to the pseudocapacitive- and diffusion-based contributions of redox ions, respectively [46,47]. From Figure 11c, it can be observed that the pseudocapacitive contribution of Na ions to the total current measured on C600B is 61.4%, 65.8%, 70.6%, 74.5%, and 77.8% at scan rates of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mV s\u22121. As can be seen, with the increase of the scan rate, the pseudocapacitive contribution is enhanced, indicating the promoted surface involvement. Even at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s\u22121, the pseudocapacitive contribution to the total current is remarkable at 61.4%, as shown in Figure 11d."

Among this, corn-based waste is generated in large quantities, greater than 200 million tons per year. The residues of corn production include mainly the corn cob, straw, and leaves, which form around 70 wt% of the total production. For instance, Brazil produces around 82.2 million tons of corn, producing around 60 million tons of waste, which might be used to feed animals or to cover the soil [48\u201350]. Due to its large availability, corn waste can be used as a viable resource for various other applications, such as biochar, used as an adsorbent [51], high-value polyphenols [52], biogas [53], and anode materials for metal-ion batteries. Cong et al. [54] employed a hydrothermal-assisted route to convert corn stalk powders at 180 \u25e6C (12 h), followed by thermal at 1000 \u25e6C, to achieve carbonization. The electrode made of the hard carbon material obtained using PVDF binder and NMP solvent exhibited a reversible capacity of more than 200 mAh g\u22121 at the current density of 200 mAh g\u22121. In another work, Zhu et al. [13] employed corn pods as the carbon source to fabricate anodes of Na-ion batteries. The process included heating at 700 \u25e6C (2 h) in nitrogen, washing with acids, and treating with chemicals such as Cu(NO3)3, Co(NO3)2, NH4F, and urea at 120 \u25e6C (8 h). The product delivered a specific capacity of 195 mAh g\u22121 after 100 cycles at the limited current density of 200 mA g\u22121. In contrast with wastes such as corn stalk [54] and corn pods [13], corn leaf has not received attention in the literature as the source of biocarbons. Moreover, further development of simple methods for the conversion of corn biomass into high-value materials is required to provide a sufficient driving force for the commercialization of such materials. Also, the utilization of water-soluble binders, as opposed to PVDF, can enhance the environmental cleansing aspect of the process. It should be mentioned that, though previously considered biologically inert, NMP has been found to demonstrate potential disease-stabilizing and immunomodulatory activity [55,56]. In particular, due to environmental, health, and safety concerns, the European Union has restricted the use of NMP. Therefore, the environmental policies set off the demand for greener alternatives [57]. The current research provides three main new insights: (1) corn leaf can be employed as the carbon source for the preparation of biocarbon, applicable as the anode material for Na-ion batteries; (2) the implementation of simple carbonization in air of corn leaf, followed by a washing step, can lead to the preparation of biocarbons with relatively high specific capacity and high-rate capability; and (3) the successful utilization of water-soluble carboxymethyl cellulose binder was demonstrated. Thermal analysis was performed, comprising DSC and TGA on corn leaf samples, based on which, two exothermic events were identified at 327 and 445 \u25e6C. The first event\nGels 2023, 9, 701 13 of 17\nwas related to the thermal decomposition of the hemicellulose of leaves, and the second was related to the decomposition of lignin of the biomass, the elimination of oxygencontaining functional groups, and the restructuring of the carbon phase. Accordingly, the corn leaves were thermally treated in air at selected temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 \u25e6C to form biocarbons, and the Na-ion storage performance of the samples was evaluated. It was observed that increasing the temperature from 400 to 500 \u25e6C considerably increases the Na-ion storage performances of biocarbons; this was assigned to the formation of graphitic nanodomains, which could provide further active sites to accommodate Na-ions. Increasing the temperature to 600 \u25e6C further improves the electrochemical performance of the sample. Furthermore, the application of the ball-milling and washing process would reduce the particle sizes of the carbonaceous material and increase the carbon purity of the sample. This sample provides a Na-ion storage capacity of 134 mAh g\u22121 after 100 cycles at high-current density of 500 mA g\u22121. The pseudocapacitive contribution to the total current measured on the sample was found to be in the range 61\u201378% at scan rates of 0.2\u20131.0 mV s\u22121. The results obtained confirmed the application of carbonization treatment at a moderate temperature of 600 \u25e6C for a short period of 20 min, followed by a ball-milling process for 2 h and washing, as a simple and potentially green approach to convert corn leaves into biocarbons for low-cost Na-ion storage performance. Future research may provide further economic and environmental evaluation of the proposed method. It should also be mentioned that carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is a linear polymeric derivative of natural cellulose which contains hydroxyl (OH) and carboxymethyl (COOH) groups. Consequently, CMC is a water-soluble binder [58], avoiding the utilization of organic binders such as NMP. Therefore, CMC, with an annual production of '2 \u00d7 105 tons [59], can be considered as a more environmentally friendly and costeffective [60] option to be used as a binder of electrodes used in metal-ion batteries. The results presented here show the desirable electrochemical performance of CMC binder in combination with corn-derived carbon. Here, CMC could provide a homogeneous slurry by avoiding the agglomeration of carbon particles and gelation of slurry. Moreover, CMC binder can form a gel polymeric network to enhance the electrical conductivity and integrity of the resultant electrode. According to the literature, CMC has been utilized to improve the electrochemical performances of Si-based compounds [61]. The current work demonstrates the possibility of employing the water-soluble CMC binder to fabricate electrodes made of corn-derived biocarbons. The structural, rheological properties and the gelation behavior of CMC corn-derived carbons in an aqueous environment, and their influence on homogeneity of the slurry and the electrochemical performances of the resultant electrodes, should be further studied in future research."
