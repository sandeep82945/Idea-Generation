            "text": "The motion of a relativistic particle in a Kepler potential can be described by the equation\nd\ndt\n(\nmx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2\n)\n= \u2212\u03b1 x|x|3 , x \u2208 R 2 \\ {0}, (1.1)\nwhere | \u00b7 | stands for the Euclidean norm of a two-dimensional vector, m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light and \u03b1 > 0 is a constant. Indeed, equation (1.1) is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Lagrangian L(x, x\u0307) = K(x\u0307) + V (x), where\nK(x\u0307) = mc2\n(\n1\u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 |x\u0307| 2\nc2\n)\nis the relativistic kinetic energy and\nV (x) = \u03b1\n|x| is the usual Newtonian gravitational potential. Such a model, providing the simplest relativistic correction for the classical Kepler problem and therefore usually called relativistic Kepler problem, has\n\u2217Under the auspices of INdAM-GNAMPA, Italy.\nbeen proposed and analyzed in several papers and books of mathematical physics (see, among others, [3, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24] and the references therein).\nThe interest for problem (1.1) from a mathematical analysis perspective seems to be much more recent and, to the best of our knowledge, only very few references can be quoted, all of them dealing with the existence of periodic solutions for different time-dependent perturbations of (1.1). More precisely, in the papers [26, 27] the equation\nd\ndt\n(\nmx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2\n)\n= \u2212M(t) x|x|3 ,\nwhere M is a positive and periodic function, is considered and the existence of periodic (and quasiperiodic) solutions is proved via topological degree theory. On the other hand, in [13] an abstract perturbation theorem of variational nature is used to establish the existence of nearly-circular periodic solutions for the perturbed problem\nd\ndt\n(\nmx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2\n)\n= \u2212\u03b1 x|x|3 + \u03b5\u2207xU(t, x), (1.2)\nwith U a periodic function in its first variable, when the parameter \u03b5 is small enough. Finally, in the recent paper [7] a higher-dimensional version of the Poincare\u0301-Birkhoff fixed point theorem is applied to (1.2) to ensure the existence, again for \u03b5 sufficiently small, of periodic solutions bifurcating from non-circular solutions of the unperturbed problem. More precisely, according to [7, Theorem 1.1], a threshold T \u2217 > 0 can be given so that, whenever the period T of the external potential U is larger than T \u2217, equation (1.2) has T -periodic solutions with any winding number k \u2265 2, provided that |\u03b5| < \u03b5\u2217(k).\nEspecially motivated by the results in [7], in this paper we continue the investigation about periodic solutions of relativistic Kepler problems, in two different, yet related, directions.\nIn the first part of the paper, we investigate the existence of T -periodic solutions for the forced problem\nd\ndt\n(\nmx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2\n)\n= \u2212\u03b1 x|x|3 +\u2207xU(t, x), (1.3)\nagain with U a potential which is T -periodic in the time variable. Our result, which can be seen as a sort of non-perturbative generalization of the ones in [7, 13], reads as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. Let U : R\u00d7 R2 \u2192 R be a potential which is smooth enough and T -periodic with respect to the first variable. Then, for each k \u2208 Z with k 6= 0, there exist at least two T -periodic solutions of (1.3) that have winding number k around the origin.\nIn particular, problem (1.3) has infinitely many T -periodic solutions: such a conclusion is new also in a perturbative setting, since it does not follow from the results in [7, 13]. The precise smoothness assumption on U will be given later, see Assumption 3.1; notice however that no other hypoheses on the external potential U (and on its period T ) are needed. We also mention that more general equations, like for instance a forced relativistic N -center problem, could be considered, see Remark 3.10.\nThe proof of Theorem 1.1 is of variational nature, relying on the fact that problem (1.3) is, formally, the Euler-Lagrange equation of the action functional\nI(x) =\n\u222b T\n0\nL(x, x\u0307) dt+ \u222b T\n0\nU(t, x) dt,\nwhere L(x, x\u0307) = K(x\u0307)+V (x) is, as already observed, the Lagrangian of the (unforced) relativistic Kepler problem. More precisely, by following a well-established point of view since the pioneering paper by Gordon [17], one of the T -periodic solutions of Theorem 1.1 is found by minimizing the functional I on the class of T -periodic loops with winding number equal to k; the second solution, on the other hand, is provided by a min-max argument, relying again on the topology of the punctured plane.\nTo rigorously implement this strategy, two main difficulties have to be faced. The first one, of course, is due to the singular nature of the Kepler potential V (x) = \u03b1/|x|, which in principle can lead, as it is typical in problems of celestial mechanics, to the occurrence of collisions for a minimum point of the functional I. The second difficulty comes from the non-differentiability of the kinetic part of the relativistic Keplerian lagrangian, K(x\u0307) = \u2212mc2(1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2)1/2, making the functional I not smooth on any natural space of functions and the usual critical point theory not directly applicable. To overcome these difficulties, we borrow some results from the recent paper [4], where a variational formulation is provided for the Lorentz force equation\nd\ndt\n(\nx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307|2\n)\n= E(t, x) + x\u0307 \u2227B(t, x), x \u2208 R3, (1.4)\nwith E and B smooth functions having the role of electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The key point for this variational formulation is the choice of the Sobolev space W 1,\u221eT of Lipschitz continuous and T -periodic functions as the domain for the associated action functional, allowing for the use of Skzulin\u2019s version [25] of non-smooth critical point theory. As carefully explained in the introduction of [4], the choice of this functional space is forced by the presence of the term x\u0307 \u2227 B in equation (1.4). However, quite surprisingly, it turns out to be very convenient also when applied to equation (1.3), which corresponds (after normalization of constants) to (1.4) for B \u2261 0 but, on the other hand, presents a singularity in the term E(t, x) = \u2212\u03b1x/|x|3 + \u2207xU(t, x) (the fact that x is two or three-dimensional does not play a role). Indeed, if x \u2208 W 1,\u221eT , the Keplerian term\n\u222b T\n0\nV (x) dt =\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03b1\n|x| dt\nof the relativistic action functional is finite if and only if x never vanishes; moreover, with some more care, the behavior of the functional I along sequences {xn} \u2282 W 1,\u221eT approaching the singularity can be successfully controlled: exclusion of collisions thus turns out to be much simpler than in the nonrelativistic regime, cf. [8].\nUsing these ideas, the existence of the minimal solution is easily given. Obtaining the second solution requires a considerable amount of extra-work. Indeed, the natural min-max principle to be used is a non-smooth version of the celebrated Ghossoub\u2019s min-max principle [14, 15], which however, to the best of our knowledge, has been established only when the smooth part of the functional is globally defined (see [21]). We thus provide an extension of this result which is suited for our more general setting, see Theorem 2.4; we also refer to the discussion after the statement for more comments. A second difficulty comes from the fact that, as already observed in [4], the usual Palais-Smale condition is not available for the action functional in the space W 1,\u221eT . Indeed, our Palais-Smale sequences are precompact only with respect to the (weaker) L\u221e topology and, as a consequence, a careful argument has to be used when the min-max level coincides with the minimal level.\nThe second part of the paper is again of variational nature, but it is concerned with the unforced problem (1.1). Of course, Theorem 1.1 can be applied also in this situation (corresponding to U \u2261 0 of problem (1.3)), thus providing, for any integer k 6= 0, a T -periodic solution to (1.1), obtained as a\nminimum point for the action functional I among the T -periodic loops with winding number k around the origin (incidentally, notice that here, due to the autonomous nature of the equation, the second solution is nothing but a time-translation of this minimal solution, see Remark 3.9). On the other hand, as shown in [7], problem (1.1) has both circular and non-circular periodic solutions, and a complete picture for their existence and classification (depending on T and k) can be provided: thus, it is natural to wonder which one of these solutions turns out to be the minimal one provided by Theorem 1.1.\nThe complete answer to this question is provided by Theorem 4.9; here, we limit ourserlves to summarize the main conclusion in the following simplified form (we assume k > 0, since negative values of k give rise to the same orbits, just run in the clockwise sense).\nTheorem 1.2. Let k \u2265 1 be an integer. Then, the T -periodic solution of problem (1.1) minimizing the action functional (in the class of T -periodic loops with winding number k around the origin) is the (unique, up to time-translations) circular periodic solution of minimal period T/k whenever no other T -periodic solutions with winding number k exist; otherwise, it is a non-circular solution and, precisely, is the (unique, up to time-translations and space-rotations) non-circular periodic solution with winding number k and such that |x| has minimal period equal to T .\nTo better understand this statement, it can be useful to say (see Proposition 4.1 and Proposition 4.3) that problem (1.1) possesses circular periodic solutions of any minimal period (and, thus, circular T - periodic solutions with winding number k for any T > 0 and k \u2265 1) and non-circular periodic solutions with winding number k \u2265 2 if and only if T > T \u2217, with T \u2217 > 0 the value found in [7] already mentioned at the beginning of this introduction. Thus, the minimal solution is circular if and only if k = 1 or k \u2265 2 and T \u2264 T \u2217, and non-circular otherwise. Moreover, since non-circular T -periodic solutions can be further distinguished via the minimal period of their radial component r = |x| (which in general can be a submultiple of T ), Theorem 1.2 further precises that the minimal non-circular solution is the one for which the minimal period of r is exactly T .\nThe proof of Theorem 1.2 relies on the following strategy. At first (see Theorem 4.7) an explicit formula for the Morse index of the circular solution is provided: such a formula is found by first computing the Conley-Zehnder index of the associated Hamiltonian system (as similarly done in [19] for the classical Keplerian orbits) and then using the Morse index theorem, in the version for general Lagrangian systems given in [2]. As a consequence of this analysis, the Morse index of the circular solution is zero only when k = 1 or k \u2265 2 and T \u2264 T \u2217. In these cases, since there are no non-circular solutions, the circular one is minimal. On the other hand, for k \u2265 2 and T > T \u2217 the minimal solution has to be non-circular. To establish which one of the non-circular solutions is the minimal one (recall that, in general, multiple non-circular solutions with winding number k exist, being distinguished by the minimal period of their radial component |x|), a direct action level comparison is performed (see Proposition 4.6), implying that the solution with lowest action is the one such that |x| has minimal period equal to T . It seems natural to conjecture that the Morse index of the non-minimal non-circular periodic solutions with winding number k is related to the minimal period of their radial component, but a proof of this fact seems to be hard.\nThe plan of the paper is the following. In Section 2 the abstract variational setting is presented and the statement of the min-max principle is given: its proof, which is closely adapted from the one in [21], is developed in the Appendix. Then, in Section 3 the proof of Theorem 1.1 is provided. Finally, in Section 4 we describe the periodic solutions of the unforced problem (1.1) and we give the proof of Theorem 1.2."

            "text": "Let X be a Banach space. According to the seminal paper by Szulkin [25], we are going to consider functionals I : X \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] that are the sum of a convex functional \u03c8 and a smooth one \u03a6; however, due to the presence of a singularity in equation (1.3), we will allow the functional \u03a6 to be singular in a suitable sense. Even if assuming \u03a6 of class C1 would be enough for our application, for the sake of generality throughout this section we just suppose that \u03a6 is locally Lipschitz continuous, as in the theory developed by Chang [10]. Summing up, we introduce the following basic set of assumptions.\nAssumption 2.1. I : X \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] is a functional which can be decomposed as\nI(x) = \u03c8(x) + \u03a6(x), \u2200 x \u2208 X,\nwhere, denoting by D\u03c8 = {x \u2208 X : \u03c8(x) < +\u221e} and D\u03a6 = {x \u2208 X : \u03a6(x) < +\u221e},\n1. D\u03a6 is open in X and DI = D\u03a6 \u2229D\u03c8 6= \u2205;\n2. \u03c8 : X \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} is convex and lower semi-continuous; moreover, \u03c8 is continuous on any nonempty compact set A \u2282 X such that supA \u03c8 is finite;\n3. \u03a6 : X \u2192 R\u222a {+\u221e} is locally Lipschitz continuous in D\u03a6, i.e. every x \u2208 D\u03a6 has a neighbourhood Vx \u2282 D\u03a6 in which \u03a6 is Lipschitz continuous;\n4. for any sequence {xn} in DI = D\u03a6 \u2229D\u03c8 such that dist(xn, \u2202D\u03a6) \u2192 0, it holds that I(xn) \u2192 +\u221e.\nThe last condition, controling the behavior of the functional near the boundary of the set D\u03a6, is the crucial one to use tools from critical point theory also in the case D\u03a6 6= X . We also observe that, by the convexity of \u03c8, D\u03c8 is a convex set.\nFor functionals that satisfy a Lipschitz condition near a point x \u2208 D\u03a6, like \u03a6 in Assumption 2.1, it is possible (see [11, \u00a72.1]) to define a directional derivative \u03a60(x, u) at x with respect to any direction u \u2208 X by setting\n\u03a60(x;u) = lim sup w\u2192x,t\u21920+ \u03a6(w + tu)\u2212 \u03a6(w) t .\nOf course, if \u03a6 is of class C1, then\n\u03a60(x;u) = \u03a6\u2032(x)[u], \u2200 x \u2208 D\u03a6, u \u2208 X.\nWe now recall some basic definitions from [23, \u00a73.2].\nDefinition 2.2. Let I : X \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] satisfy Assumption 2.1.\n1. A point x \u2208 DI is a critical point of I if\n\u03a60(x; z \u2212 x) + \u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(x) \u2265 0, \u2200 z \u2208 X,\n2. A Palais-Smale (abbreviated PS-) sequence for I at level c is a sequence {xn} in X such that I(xn) \u2192 c and\n\u03a60(xn; z \u2212 xn) + \u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(xn) \u2265 \u2212\u01ebn\u2016z \u2212 xn\u2016, \u2200 n \u2208 N and z \u2208 X,\nfor some sequence \u01ebn \u2192 0+.\nProposition 2.3. Let I : X \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] satisfy Assumption 2.1. Then: 1. if x \u2208 DI is a local minimum of I, then x is a critical point of I;\n2. if x \u2208 DI is a limit point of a PS-sequence for I at level c \u2208 R, then x is a critical point of I and I(x) = c.\nProof. 1. If x \u2208 DI is a local minimum of I, the convexity of \u03c8 implies that\n0 \u2264 I(x+ t(z \u2212 x))\u2212 I(x) \u2264 \u03a6(x+ t(z \u2212 x)) \u2212 \u03a6(x) + (1 \u2212 t)\u03c8(x) + t\u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(x) = \u03a6(x+ t(z \u2212 x)) \u2212 \u03a6(x) + t(\u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(x))\nfor all z \u2208 X and all positive t which are small enough. Hence the thesis follows by dividing by t and recalling Definition 2.2.\n2. Without loss of generality, we may assume that {xn} is a PS-sequence for I at level c such that xn \u2192 x \u2208 X . Assumption 2.1.4 and the fact that I(xn) \u2192 c grant that x 6\u2208 \u2202D\u03a6 and, thus, x \u2208 D\u03a6. Since \u03a60 is upper semi-continuous (see [11, Proposition 2.1.1]) and \u2212\u03c8 is upper semi-continuous, we have\n\u03a60(x; z \u2212 x) + \u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(x) \u2265 lim sup n\u2192\u221e\n[ \u03a60(xn; z \u2212 xn) + \u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(xn) ] \u2265 0, \u2200 z \u2208 X.\nChoosing z = x in Definition 2.2.2, we obtain\n\u03c8(x) \u2264 lim inf n\u2192\u221e \u03c8(xn) \u2264 lim sup n\u2192\u221e \u03c8(xn) \u2264 \u03a60(xn, x\u2212 xn) + \u03c8(x) + \u01ebn\u2016x\u2212 xn\u2016 = \u03c8(x)\nand, hence, I is continuous at x.\nIn our application of Section 3, we will find two families of critical points for I: the first one will be made by local minima. In order to find the second one, we will use the following non-smooth version of the celebrated Ghossoub\u2019s min-max principle [14, 15].\nTheorem 2.4. Let I = \u03c8+\u03a6 be a functional satisfying Assumption 2.1, let B be a closed set in X and F be a family of compact sets in X such that:\n1. F is homotopy stable with extended boundary B, that is, for each A \u2208 F and each continuous deformation \u03b7 \u2208 C0([0, 1]\u00d7X,X) such that\n\u03b7(t, x) = x, \u2200 (t, x) \u2208 ({0} \u00d7X) \u222a ([0, 1]\u00d7B) and \u03b7([0, 1]\u00d7A) \u2282 D\u03a6,\none has that \u03b7({1} \u00d7A) \u2208 F ;\n2. c := inf A\u2208F sup x\u2208A\nI(x) < +\u221e;\n3. there exists a closed set F in X such that\n(A \u2229 F ) \\B 6= \u2205, \u2200 A \u2208 F and sup B I \u2264 inf F I;\nThen, for any sequence {An} in F such that lim n\u2192\u221e sup An I = c, there exists a PS-sequence {xn} \u2282 X at level c such that dist(xn, An) \u2192 0. If moreover infF I = c, then also dist(xn, F ) \u2192 0.\nWhen D\u03a6 = X , the result above has been established by Livrea and Marano in [21, Theorem 3.1]. Here, we provide an extension to the case D\u03a6 6= X , having in mind the peculiar topology induced by the singularity of the gravitational force in (1.3). We show in Lemma 3.8 that our D\u03a6 is made up by countably many connected components \u039bk, k \u2208 Z, which are open in X and, moreover, \u039bk \u2229 D\u03c8 is non-empty and bounded for each k 6= 0. For each k 6= 0, in Section 3.2 we find a minimum point x\u0304 of I in \u039bk: more precisely, x\u0304 is a T periodic solution of (1.3) which makes k turns in the plane around the origin in each period, where the sign of k gives orientation. Now, the first fundamental group of \u039bk is non-trivial when k 6= 0: the loop given by [0, 1] \u220b s 7\u2192 x\u0304(\u00b7 + sT ) \u2208 \u039bk is not nullhomotopic in \u039bk. Therefore, one can exploit the family F of loops in \u039bk which are not nullhomotopic in order to get the min-max level c of Theorem 2.4. Here a problem arises about the class of continuous deformations \u03b7 with respect to which F is needed to be stable: in the result by Livrea and Marano the presence of singularities of \u03a6 is not considered and, thus, the deformations, as usual, are only required to fix the \u201cboundary\u201d ({0} \u00d7X) \u222a ([0, 1]\u00d7B). As a consequence, that class of deformations do not comply with the topology of \u039bk: a loop which is not nullhomotopic in \u039bk could be transformed into a nullhomotopic one by such a deformation \u03b7 that doesn\u2019t behave properly near \u2202D\u03a6. In other words, the family F we would like to use is not homotopy stable in the usual sense. On the other hand, we cannot add to F also all nullhomotopic loops since, in that case, we could not exclude that the PS-sequence provided by a result like Theorem 2.4 actually converges to the minimum point x\u0304 itself: we need our loops to really turn around the singularities of \u03a6. Our solution consists in adding a condition on the deformations \u03b7 that can be used in checking the homotopic stability of any set A \u2208 F : namely that \u03b7([0, 1], A) \u2282 D\u03a6 (see assumption 1 in 2.4). That condition imposes that \u03b7(s, A) never crosses the boundary of D\u03a6 and, thus, \u03b7(s, A) remains not nullhomotopic in \u039bk as s ranges in [0, 1]. By reducing the class of admissible deformations \u03b7, we enlarge the collection of families F that are homotopy stable and obtain a result which is slightly more general than [21, Theorem 3.1]. Clearly, the main issue is to exploit the fact that the singularities of our functional \u03a6 satisfy the fourth condition in Assumption 2.1: some small, but non-trivial, adjustments of the proof by Livrea and Marano can accomplish the goal. Since the whole argument in [21] is already quite delicate, we decided to provide a complete proof of Theorem 2.4 in the Appendix.\nRemark 2.5. As well-known, if any PS-sequence possesses a convergent subsequence, the functional I is said to satisfy the Palais-Smale condition. Thus, if a functional I in the assumptions of Theorem 2.4 also satisfies the PS-condition, a critical point of I at level c is directly obtained, in view of the second statement in Proposition 2.3. In our application, however, we will not make direct use of this strategy. Indeed, in spite of the fact that the PS-sequence provided by Theorem 2.4 will be checked to be bounded, due to the specific form of the functional it seems hard to prove that it is relatively compact in the (strong) topology of X . Nonetheless, we will manage to prove that, in our setting, the relative compactness in a weaker topology is enough to obtain a critical point at level c (cf. Proposition 3.4)."

            "text": "As already mentioned in the introduction, in what follows we take advantage of some results proved by Arcoya, Bereanu and Torres in [4], where a (non-smooth) variational formulation for Lorentz force equation (1.4) is provided. In our setting some extra work is needed due to the singularity of the nonlinear term. Let us consider the Banach space\nX =W 1,\u221eT = { x \u2208 W 1,\u221e(0, T ;R2) : x(0) = x(T ) } ,\nendowed with its usual norm \u2016x\u2016 = \u2016x\u2016\u221e + \u2016x\u0307\u2016\u221e.

The simple, but crucial, observation, is that in fact \u03a6(x) is always infinite outside \u039b: indeed, if a function x \u2208 X vanishes somewhere in [0, T ], due to its Lipschitz continuity the integral \u222b T\n0 \u03b1/|x(t)| dt is surely infinite, and so \u03a6(x) = +\u221e. Since this will be often used in what follows, we state it as a Lemma. Lemma 3.2. For every x \u2208 X, \u03a6(x) < +\u221e if and only if x \u2208 \u039b: that is, with the notation of Assumptions 2.1, D\u03a6 = \u039b.\nWe then define I : X \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] as\nI(x) = \u03c8(x) + \u03a6(x), \u2200 x \u2208 X.\nIn the next proposition we show that the functional I is suitable for the abstract setting introduced in Section 2; moreover, we highlight a further important property of the functional \u03c8.\nProposition 3.3. The functional I = \u03c8 + \u03a6 satisfies Assumptions 2.1. Moreover, the functional \u03c8 is lower semicontinuous with respect to uniform convergence, namely: if x \u2208 X and {xn} is a sequence in D\u03c8 such that xn \u2192 x uniformly on [0, T ], then x \u2208 D\u03c8 and\n\u03c8(x) \u2264 lim inf n\u2192+\u221e \u03c8(xn). (3.3)\nProof. First, we are going to verify separately each point in Assumptions 2.1.\n1. By Lemma 3.2 we haveD\u03a6 = \u039b which is open inX . On the other hand,D\u03c8 = {x \u2208 X : \u2016x\u0307\u2016\u221e \u2264 c} so that clearly D\u03c8 \u2229D\u03a6 6= \u2205.\n2. The convexity of \u03c8 follows directly from the convexity of the function F . Moreover, the restriction \u03c8|D\u03c8 of \u03c8 to D\u03c8 is continuous, as it is easily checked using the dominated convergence theorem (cf. [4, Lemma 2]). Since D\u03c8 is closed, the lower semicontinuity of \u03c8 on X follows.\n3. The functional \u03a6 is actually of class C1 (and, hence, locally Lipschitz continuous) on the open set D\u03a6 = \u039b, with\n\u03a6\u2032(x)[y] = \u03a60(x; y) =\n\u222b T\n0\n\u2329 \u2212\u03b1 x(t)|x(t)|3 +\u2207xU(t, x(t)), y(t) \u232a dt, (3.4)\nfor any x \u2208 \u039b and y \u2208 X (see, for instance, [22]).\n4. At first, we notice that\n\u2202D\u03a6 = X \\ \u039b = {x \u2208 X : x(t) = 0 for some t \u2208 [0, T ]}.\nSo, let us consider a sequence {xn} inD\u03a6\u2229D\u03c8 such that dn := dist(xn, \u2202D\u03a6) \u2192 0 and, accordingly, let yn \u2208 \u2202D\u03a6 be such that \u2016xn \u2212 yn\u2016 \u2264 2dn. Since \u2016x\u0307n\u2016\u221e \u2264 c for any n, we find that\n\u2016y\u0307n\u2016\u221e \u2264 c+ \u2016y\u0307n \u2212 x\u0307n\u2016\u221e \u2264 c+ \u2016yn \u2212 xn\u2016 \u2264 c+ dn \u2264 c+ 1\nfor n large enough. Moreover, since yn(tn) = 0 for some tn \u2208 [0, T ], we have\n\u2016yn\u2016\u221e \u2264 (c+ 1)T\nand thus the sequence {yn} is bounded in X . Since \u2016xn\u2212yn\u2016 \u2264 2dn, the sequence {xn} is bounded in X as well. Therefore, the Ascoli-Arzela\u0300 theorem yields the existence of a continuous function\nz such that, up to subsequence, xn \u2192 z and yn \u2192 z uniformly on [0, T ]. Hence, z(0) = z(T ) and z(t\u0304) = 0 for some t\u0304 \u2208 [0, T ], limit point of the sequence tn. Moreover, passing to the limit in the Lipschitz-continuity condition\n|xn(t2)\u2212 xn(t1)| \u2264 c|t2 \u2212 t1|, for every t1, t2 \u2208 [0, T ],\nwe easily see that z \u2208 D\u03c8 \u2282 X and so, by Lemma 3.2, \u222b T\n0\n\u03b1\n|z(t)| dt = +\u221e.\nHence, by Fatou\u2019s lemma\nlim inf n\u2192+\u221e\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03b1\n|xn(t)| dt \u2265\n\u222b T\n0\nlim inf n\u2192+\u221e\n\u03b1\n|xn(t)| dt =\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03b1\n|z(t)| dt = +\u221e.\nSince \u03c8(xn) and \u222b T\n0 U(t, xn(t))dt remain bounded by the uniform convergence of xn to z, we finally\nconclude that I(xn) \u2192 +\u221e as desired. Finally, for the proof of the lower semincontinuity property (3.3) we refer the reader to [4, Lemma 3] (dealing with Dirichlet boundary condition; the periodic problem is taken into account in Section 4 of the same paper).\nThe following proposition establishes a compactness property of the functional I. Notice, however, that what we are going to prove differs from the usual Palais-Smale condition: indeed, the convergence of a subsequence in a weaker topology is obtained.\nProposition 3.4. Let {xn} \u2282 X be a bounded Palais-Smale sequence at level c. Then, up to subsequence, xn \u2192 x uniformly on [0, T ], with x a critical point of I satisfying I(x) = c. Proof. We follow closely the arguments in [4, Lemma 5], with just some more care due to the presence of the singularity. Let {xn} \u2282 X be a bounded Palais-Smale sequence at level c and notice that this implies {xn} \u2282 D\u03a6 \u2229D\u03c8 (otherwise I(xn) = +\u221e). Using the Ascoli-Arzela\u0300 theorem as in the proof of the fourth point of Proposition 3.3, we thus infer the existence of x \u2208 D\u03c8 such that, up to subsequence, xn \u2192 x uniformly on [0, T ]; moreover, by (3.3),\n\u03c8(x) \u2264 lim inf n\u2192+\u221e \u03c8(xn). (3.5)\nOn the other hand, Assumption 2.1-4 yields that x /\u2208 \u2202D\u03a6, since otherwise it would be I(xn) = \u03c8(xn) + \u03a6(xn) \u2192 +\u221e, contrarily to I(xn) \u2192 c. Thus, recalling that \u2202D\u03a6 = X \\ \u039b, we conclude that x \u2208 \u039b and, hence,\n\u03a6(x) = lim n\u2192+\u221e\n\u03a6(xn) and \u03a6 \u2032(x)[z \u2212 x] = lim n\u2192+\u221e \u03a6\u2032(xn)[z \u2212 xn], \u2200 z \u2208 X, (3.6)\nwhere the last equality is easily obtained by using the explicit formula (3.4). By the above relations together with (3.5), passing to the limsup in the inequality characterizing the PS-sequence we thus found\n\u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(x) + \u03a6\u2032(x)[z \u2212 x] \u2265 0, \u2200z \u2208 X,\nproving that x is a critical point of I. It remains to show that I(x) = c. For this, we choose z = x in the inequality of the PS-sequence so as to obtain\n\u03c8(xn) \u2264 \u03c8(x) + \u03a6\u2032(xn)[x \u2212 xn] + \u01ebn\u2016x\u2212 xn\u2016.\nThus, lim supn\u2192+\u221e \u03c8(xn) \u2264 \u03c8(x) which together with (3.5) yields \u03c8(x) = limn\u2192+\u221e \u03c8(xn). Recalling (3.6), we finally find\nI(x) = lim n\u2192+\u221e I(xn) = c,\nthus concluding the proof.\nThe rest of the section is devoted to the proof that critical points of the functional I correspond to T -periodic solutions of (3.1), as stated in the proposition below.\nProposition 3.5. Any critical point of I, according to Definition 2.2.1, is a T -periodic solution of (3.1).\nThe above statement essentially corresponds to [4, Theorem 6]. We point out that the difficulties in establishing this result come from the fact that, a priori, a critical point x \u2208 DI could satisfy \u2016x\u0307\u2016\u221e = c: to exclude this, an ad-hoc argument is thus required. On the other hand, the singularity of the nonlinear term does not play a real role, since a critical point satisfy x \u2208 D\u03a6 by definition and the notion of critical point is of local nature. However, since the complete argument is quite delicate, we chose here to provide the complete proof. As the one in [4], it relies in an essential way on some preliminary lemmas established in [5, 6] for the auxiliary problem\n\n \n \nd\ndt\n(\nmu\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |u\u0307|2/c2\n)\n= f(t) in [0, T ]\nu(0)\u2212 u(T ) = 0 = u\u0307(0)\u2212 u\u0307(T ) (3.7)\nwith f \u2208 L1(0, T ), and the related functional J : X \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] defined by\nJ(u) = \u03c8(u) +\n\u222b T\n0\n\u3008f(t), u\u3009 dt, \u2200 u \u2208 X. (3.8)\nMore precisely, we are going to make use of the next result.\nLemma 3.6. The following statements hold:\n1. problem (3.7) has a solution if and only if \u222b T\n0 f(t) dt = 0; in this case, the set of solutions is given\nby {u0 + c} where u0 is a fixed solution and c is any constant vector;\n2. the functional J has a global minimum if and only if \u222b T\n0 f(t) dt = 0; in this case, the set of minima\nis given by {u0 + c} where u0 is a minimum and c is any constant vector;\n3. u is a solution of (3.7) if and only if it is a global minimum of J .\nProof. It is convenient to introduce the following notation. Define, for s \u2208 R2 with |s| < c,\n\u03d5(s) = ms \u221a\n1\u2212 |s|2/c2 ,\nso that the equation in (3.7) becomes ddt(\u03d5(u\u0307)) = f(t). It is readily verified that \u03d5 is a global homeomorhism of Bc(0) \u2282 R2 onto R2 and, moreover,\n\u2207F (s) = \u03d5(s), \u2200 s \u2208 Bc(0),\nwhere F is defined in (3.2). We are now in a position to prove the various parts of the statement.\n1. Integrating the equation and using the fact that \u03d5 is a global homeomorhism of Bc(0) onto R 2,\nwe find\nu\u0307(t) = \u03d5\u22121 ( \u03d5(u\u0307(0)) + \u222b t\n0\nf(s) ds\n)\n, \u2200 t \u2208 [0, T ].\nHence, since it has to be u\u0307(0) = u\u0307(T ), the condition \u222b T\n0 f(t) dt = 0 is easily seen to be necessary\nfor the solvability of problem (3.7).\nOn the contrary, suppose that such a condition is satisfied. A further integration yields\nu(t) = u(0) +\n\u222b t\n0\n\u03d5\u22121 ( \u03d5(u\u0307(0)) + \u222b s\n0\nf(\u03c4) d\u03c4\n)\nds, \u2200 t \u2208 [0, T ].\nTherefore, u is a solution of (3.7) if and only if u(0) = u(T ), that is\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03d5\u22121 ( \u03d5(u\u0307(0)) + \u222b s\n0\nf(\u03c4)d\u03c4\n)\nds = 0,\nand, in such a case, the function u\u0303 = u + c is still a solution for every c \u2208 R2. To conclude the proof, we thus need to show that, for any fixed f \u2208 L1(0, T ) with \u222b T\n0 f = 0, the equation\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03d5\u22121 ( d+ \u222b s\n0\nf(\u03c4) d\u03c4\n)\nds = 0, d \u2208 R2,\nadmits a unique solution: this is proved in [6, Lemma 2] (see also [6, Example 2]).\n2. We first notice that, if \u222b T 0 f(t) dt 6= 0, then\nJ(c) =\n\u2329\n\u222b T\n0\nf(t) dt, c\n\u232a\nfor any constant function u(t) \u2261 c \u2208 R2; hence, the functional J is unbounded below (and above). Then, \u222b T\n0 f(t) dt = 0 is a necessary condition for the existence of global minima of J .\nSecond, we prove that if u1, u2 are both global minima of J , then u\u03071 = u\u03072 a.e. on [0, T ]. Indeed, if u\u03071 6= u\u03072 on a positive measure set S \u2282 [0, T ], then from the strict convexity of F it holds\nF (\u03bbu\u03071(t) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)u\u03072(t)) \u2264 \u03bbF (u\u03071(t)) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)F (u\u03072(t)), a.e. in [0, T ],\nwith strict inequality when t \u2208 S. Then\nJ(\u03bbu1 + (1\u2212 \u03bb)u2) < \u03bbJ(u1) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)J(u2),\ncontradicting the fact that u1, u2 are global minima. From u\u03071 = u\u03072 a.e, it follows of course that u2 \u2212 u1 \u2261 c for some c \u2208 R2, proving the desired characterization of the set of global minima. It thus remains to prove the existence of global minima when the condition \u222b T\n0 f(t) dt = 0 is satisfied. For this, we refer to the next point 3, showing in fact that solutions of (3.7) (which exist, by point 1, in such a case) are global minima of J\n3. Let u be a solution of (3.7) and take v \u2208 X . We can assume \u2016v\u0307\u2016\u221e \u2264 c, otherwise the conclusion is obvious; recalling that \u2207F (s) = \u03d5(s), the convexity of F gives\nF (v\u0307(t)) \u2265 F (u\u0307(t)) + \u3008\u03d5(u\u0307(t)), v\u0307(t)\u2212 u\u0307(t)\u3009, a.e. in [0, T ]. Then, using the above equality together with the fact that u solves (3.7), we obtain\nJ(v)\u2212 J(u) = \u222b T\n0\n( F (v\u0307(t)) \u2212 F (u\u0307(t)) + \u3008f(t), v(t)\u2212 u(t)\u3009 ) dt\n\u2265 \u222b T\n0\n( \u3008\u03d5(u\u0307(t)), v\u0307(t)\u2212 u\u0307(t)\u3009+ \u3008f(t), v(t) \u2212 u(t)\u3009 ) dt\n=\n\u222b T\n0\n( \u2212 \u2329 d\ndt (\u03d5(u\u0307(t))) , v(t)\u2212 u(t)\n\u232a + \u3008f(t), v(t)\u2212 u(t)\u3009 ) dt = 0,\nproving that u is a global minimum of J .\nThe fact that any global minimum of J is a solution of (3.7) is now an obvious consequence of what we have proved so far. Indeed, let us take u\u0304 solution of (3.7) and, thus, global minimum of J . Since any other global minimum u of J is of the form u = u\u0304+ c for some c \u2208 R2, we immediately see that u is a solution of (3.7), as well.\nWe are now in a position to provide the proof of Proposition 3.5.\nProof of Proposition 3.5. Let x \u2208 DI be a critical point of I and define\nf(t) = \u2212\u03b1 x(t)|x(t)|3 +\u2207xU(t, x(t)), \u2200 t \u2208 [0, T ].\nSince \u2207xU is L1-Carathe\u0301odory, we deduce that f \u2208 L1(0, T ). Recalling (3.4), the fact that x is a critical point of I reads as\n\u222b T\n0\n\u3008f(t), u(t)\u2212 x(t)\u3009 dt + \u03c8(u)\u2212 \u03c8(x) \u2265 0, \u2200 u \u2208 X,\nwhich means that x is a global minimum of the functional J defined in (3.8). Hence, Lemma 3.6 applies and the proposition is proved.\nRemark 3.7. Let us mention that the converse of Proposition 3.5 also holds true: that is, T -periodic solutions of (3.1) are critical points of the functional I. This however can be proved with standard arguments, since the functional I is smooth on the interior of its domain DI ."

To this end, we define\nB = {x\u0304}\nand F = {\u03b3([0, 1]) : \u03b3 \u2208 C(T1,\u039bk), \u03b3 is not nullhomotopic and \u03b3(0) = x\u0304},\nthat is, the set of the images of all non nullhomotopic loops based at x\u0304 in the topological space \u039bk (here T 1 is meant as the quotient space R/Z, so that \u03b3(0) = \u03b3(1) = x\u0304). Of course B is closed in X and F is a family of compact sets of X . Notice that F is non empty since the compact set\nA\u0304 := \u03b3\u0304([0, 1]), with \u03b3\u0304(s) = x\u0304(Ts+ \u00b7) \u2208 \u039bk, (3.14)\nbelongs to F . We now verify the other assumptions of Theorem 2.4. First, we prove that F is homotopy stable with extended boundary B. So, let us consider A = \u03b3([0, 1]) \u2208 F and a continuous function \u03b7 : [0, 1]\u00d7X \u2192 X such that\n\u03b7(t, x) = x, \u2200(t, x) \u2208 ({0} \u00d7X) \u222a ([0, 1]\u00d7B) and \u03b7([0, 1]\u00d7A) \u2282 D\u03a6.\nPreminarily, we observe that, for any s \u2208 [0, 1], the function t 7\u2192 \u03b7(t, \u03b3(s)) \u2208 D\u03a6 provides an homotopy of the path \u03b3(s) (which is obtained at t = 0) in the punctured plane R2 \\ {0}: since \u03b3(s) \u2208 \u039bk, by the homotopy invariance of the winding number it has to be \u03b7(t, \u03b3(s)) \u2208 \u039bk for any t \u2208 [0, 1]. Now, let us set \u03b3t(s) = \u03b7(t, \u03b3(s)) for every (t, s) \u2208 [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1]. It is easily checked that, for every t \u2208 [0, 1], \u03b3t is a loop of base x\u0304 in the topological space \u039bk. Moreover, by construction all these loops are homotopic: since \u03b30 = \u03b3 is not nullhomotopic, we deduce that \u03b31 is not nullhomotopic as well. We have thus proved that \u03b7(1, A) = \u03b7(1, \u03b3([0, 1]) \u2208 F , as desired. Second, recalling the definition of A\u0304 \u2208 F given above, we have\nc := inf A\u2208F sup x\u2208A I(x) \u2264 sup x\u2208A\u0304 I(x) = sup s\u2208[0,1] I(x\u0304(sT + \u00b7)) < +\u221e\nsince \u03c8(x\u0304(sT + \u00b7)) = \u03c8(x\u0304) and \u03a6(x\u0304(sT + \u00b7)) is bounded, due to the fact that the functions x\u0304(sT + \u00b7) are uniformly bounded and uniformly bounded away from the singularity. Finally, we define F = {x \u2208 X : \u2016x\u2212 x\u0304\u2016\u221e = r}, with r \u2208 (0,mint |x\u0304(t)|) arbitrarily chosen. We stress that, in the above formula, the sup norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e is considered, even if the ambient space is X =W 1,\u221eT ; since uniform convergence is implied by convergence\nin X , the set F is closed in X Let us also notice that, by the Rouche\u0301\u2019s property (3.10), the set {x \u2208 X : \u2016x\u2212 x\u0304\u2016\u221e \u2264 r} is entirely contained in \u039bk; hence we have\nsup B I = I(x\u0304) \u2264 inf F I.\nWe claim that A \u2229 F 6= \u2205 for every A = \u03b3([0, 1]) \u2208 F . Indeed, if otherwise \u2016\u03b3(s) \u2212 x\u0304\u2016\u221e < r for every s \u2208 [0, 1], the convex deformation \u03bd(\u03bb, s) = \u03bbx\u0304 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b3(s) (with \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]) would imply that \u03b3 is homotopic in \u039bk to the constant loop of base x\u0304, against the assumption. Since F \u2229B = \u2205, the condition (A \u2229 F ) \\B 6= \u2205 of Theorem 2.4 thus follows. Summing up, we can apply Theorem 2.4. Thus, fixed a sequence {An} in F such that supAn I \u2192 c we can find a PS-sequence {xn} in X , at level c, such that dist(xn, An) \u2192 0; moreover, if infF I = c, then dist(xn, F ) \u2192 0. Now, let us recall that An \u2282 \u039bk and observe that, since I(x) = +\u221e if x /\u2208 D\u03c8 and supAn I \u2192 c, it must be An \u2282 D\u03c8, as well. Hence, An \u2282 D\u03a6 \u2229 D\u03c8, so that the fourth condition in Assumption 2.1 implies that dist(An, \u2202\u039bk) remains bounded away from zero. Hence, from dist(xn, An) \u2192 0 we can infer that xn \u2208 \u039bk if n is large enough. Using the inequality (3.11), we thus find that {xn} is bounded. Then, Proposition 3.4 applies, providing the existence of a critical point x\u2217 of I at level c, obtained as the uniform limit of a subsequence of {xn}. By the first assertion in Lemma 3.8, x\u2217 \u2208 \u039bk. If infF I < c, since I(x\u0304) \u2264 infF I \u2264 c = I(x\u2217) by assumptions 2 and 3 of Theorem 2.4 (see its proof in the appendix), we get x\u2217 6= x\u0304. If, otherwise, infF I = c, then we also know that dist(xn, F ) \u2192 0. Then, since dist\u221e(xn, F ) := infy\u2208F \u2016xn \u2212 y\u2016\u221e \u2264 dist(xn, F ), we have dist\u221e(xn, F ) \u2192 0. On the other hand, dist\u221e(xn, F ) \u2192 dist\u221e(x\u2217, F ) and so dist\u221e(x\u2217, F ) = 0.

Hence, in both the cases, a second T -periodic solution to (3.1), with winding number equal to k, is found.\nRemark 3.9. We observe that the equality I(x\u0304) = c surely holds for the autonomous equation\nd\ndt\n(\nmx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2\n)\n= \u2212\u03b1 x|x|3 +\u2207U(x).\nIndeed, in this case the functional I is invariant under time-translation and hence, recalling the definition in (3.14),\nc = inf A\u2208F sup x\u2208A I(x) \u2264 sup x\u2208A\u0304 I(x) = I(x\u0304).\nIn this situation the functional I possesses the continuum of local minima A\u0304.\nRemark 3.10. With minor modifications of the arguments used in this section, Theorem 1.1 could be extended to more general equations. For instance, it is possible to obtain a similar result for a forced relativistic N -center problem of the type\nd\ndt\n(\nmx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2\n)\n= \u2212 N \u2211\nj=1\n\u03b1j x\u2212 \u03bej\n|x\u2212 \u03bej |3 +\u2207xU(t, x), x \u2208 R2 \\ {\u03be1, . . . , \u03beN}, (3.15)\nwhere \u03be1, . . . \u03beN are fixed points in R 2 and \u03b1j > 0, for every j = 1, . . . , N (clearly, equation (3.15) reduces to (3.1) for N = 1 and \u03be1 = 0). In this more general setting, the existence of T -periodic solutions can be proved in any non-trivial homotopy class \u0393 \u2208 \u03c01(R2 \\ {\u03be1, . . . , \u03ben}) such that \u0393 \u2229 D\u03c8 6= \u2205. Notice\nthat, in the case of N \u2265 2 centers, this requirement is essential: indeed, the natural bound |x\u0307| \u2264 c for any x \u2208 D\u03c8 implies that\nmax t,s\u2208[0,T ]\n|x(t) \u2212 x(s)| \u2264 cT,\nand, thus, solutions x to problem (3.15) cannot belong to a class \u0393 containing loops with non-zero winding number around \u03bei and \u03bej , if |\u03bei \u2212 \u03bej | > cT ."

As far as circular solutions are concerned, we notice that a circular T -periodic solution belongs to \u039bk if and only if its minimal period is T/k. With this in mind, it is immediate to prove the following result.\nProposition 4.1. For every T > 0 and k \u2208 N, with k \u2265 1, problem (4.1) possesses a unique circular T -periodic solution xC \u2208 \u039bk, given by\nxC(t) = Re i\u03c9t, R = L \u221a L2c2 \u2212 \u03b12 m\u03b1c , \u03c9 = m\u03b12c L2 \u221a L2c2 \u2212 \u03b12 , (4.2)\nwhere (the angular momentum) L > 0 is the solution of\nL2 \u221a L2c2 \u2212 \u03b12 = m\u03b1 2c\n2\u03c0k T. (4.3)\nOn the other hand, the existence of non-circular periodic solutions of (4.1) can be proved by means of a phase-plane analysis, on the lines of the recent paper [7], which presents a precise description of the solutions, for a given energy and angular momentum. It is important to observe, as it will be clear from the proof of Proposition 4.3, that problem (4.1) does not have non-circular periodic solutions in \u039b1. Moreover, for k \u2265 2, non-circular periodic solutions in \u039bk can be classified according to the following definition.\nDefinition 4.2. Let T > 0, k \u2208 N, with k \u2265 2, and n \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1}. A non-circular T -periodic solution x of (4.1) is said to be a solution of type (n, k) if x \u2208 \u039bk and |x| has minimal period T/n. Let us define\nT\u2217 = 2\u03c0\u03b1\nmc3 (4.4)\nand, for every k \u2208 N, k \u2265 1\nukn =\n\n \n \nnk3\n(k2 \u2212 n2)3/2 T\u2217 if n \u2208 {0, . . . , k \u2212 1} +\u221e if n = k. (4.5)\nWe are now in position to state the result on the existence of non-circular periodic solutions of (4.1).\nProposition 4.3. Let T > 0, k \u2208 N, with k \u2265 2, and iT \u2208 {0, . . . , k \u2212 1} such that\nukiT < T \u2264 ukiT+1. (4.6)\nThen:\n1. if iT = 0 problem (4.1) does not admit non-circular T -periodic solutions in \u039bk\n2. if iT > 0 problem (4.1) has exactly iT non-circular T -periodic solutions in \u039bk and they are of type (1, k), . . . , (iT , k)\nProof. The proof is based on the phase-plane analysis given in [7, Sect. 2]. In that paper the existence of periodic solutions of (4.1) is studied depending on the values of the energy\nh = mc2 \u221a 1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2 \u2212 \u03b1|x| (4.7)\nand of the angular momentum\nL = \u3008x, Jp\u3009, where J = (\n0 1 \u22121 0\n)\n, p = mx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307|2/c2 . (4.8)\nMore precisely, it is shown that non-circular periodic solutions exist if and only if (h, L) belongs to the set\n\u03a3 =\n{\n(h, L) \u2208 R2 : 0 < h < mc2, \u03b1 2\nc2 < L2 <\n\u03b12m2c2 m2c4 \u2212 h2 } .\nMoreover, when (h, L) \u2208 \u03a3, the radial component |x| of a solution x of (4.1) is always periodic and its period Th depends on the energy h according to the relation\nTh = 2\u03c0\u03b1m2c3\n(m2c4 \u2212 h2) 32 (4.9)\n(see [7, Prop. 2.1]). On the other hand, the angular component \u03b8 of x has a total variation in the interval [0, Th] given by\n\u2206\u03b8 = 2\u03c0 \u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b1 2\nL2c2\n(4.10)\n(see [7, Formula (2.25)]). Observing that \u2206\u03b8 > 2\u03c0, it is immediate to conclude that (4.1) does not admits non-circular periodic solutions in \u039b1. For k \u2265 2, from the previous discussion we deduce that x is a T -periodic solution of (4.1) in \u039bk if and only if there exist n \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1} and (h, L) \u2208 \u03a3 such that\nT = nTh, n\u2206\u03b8 = 2\u03c0k. (4.11)\nNotice that (4.11) implies that periodic non-circular solutions in \u039bk are necessarily solutions of type (n, k), for some n \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1}. Now, recalling (4.9) and (4.10), it is easy to see that (4.11) is equivalent to\nm2c4 \u2212 h4 = ( 2\u03c0\u03b1m2c3n\nT\n)2/3\n, L2 = \u03b12 c2 k2 k2 \u2212 n2 .\nFrom these relations we then obtain that (h, L) \u2208 \u03a3 if and only if\n\u03b12 c2 k2 k2 \u2212 n2 < \u03b14/3m2/3T 2/3 (2\u03c0n)2/3 ,\ni.e.\nT > 2\u03c0\u03b1k3n\nmc3(k2 \u2212 n2)3/2 .\nFrom (4.4) and (4.5), we can write this condition as T > ukn. Therefore, (4.1) has a T -periodic solution if and only if T > ukn, for some n \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, and this solution is of type (n, k). This is sufficient to conclude.\nThe aim of the next sections is to study the minimality of the circular and non-circular periodic solutions of (4.1) given in Propositions 4.1 and 4.3, depending on the values of T > 0. In particular, we plan to detect which is the minimal solution whose existence has been proved in Section 3.2. To this end, we will be able to explicitly compute and compare the action levels of the non-circular solutions (see Section 4.2). The computation of the action level of circular solutions is still possible, but it it not evident how this level is related to the levels of non-circular solutions for any T > 0. However, computing the Morse index of circular solutions (see Section 4.3) will be sufficient to conclude (Section 4.4)."

Indeed, as already noticed problem (4.1) is the Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to the Lagrangian\nL(x, x\u0307) = mc2 ( 1\u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 |x\u0307| 2\nc2\n)\n+ \u03b1\n|x| .\nGiven a circular solution xC of (4.1), linearizing the equation at xC and taking into account that\n\u22022L \u2202x\u0307 \u2202x = 0,\nwe obtain d\ndt (A(t)q\u0307) = B(t)q, (4.24)\nwhere\nA(t) = m\nc2\n( 1\u2212 |x\u0307C(t)| 2\nc2\n)\u22123/2\nxC(t)\u2297 xC(t) +m ( 1\u2212 |x\u0307C(t)| 2\nc2\n)\u22121/2\nId\nand B(t) = 3\u03b1|xC(t)|\u22125 xC(t)\u2297 xC(t)\u2212 \u03b1|xC(t)|\u22123 Id,\nfor every t \u2208 [0, T ]. Here x\u2297 y = xy\u22a4 when x and y are column vector of the same dimension. We now observe that (4.24) is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the quadratic Lagrangian\nLC(t, q, q\u0307) = 1 2 \u3008A(t)q\u0307, q\u0307\u3009+ 1 2 \u3008B(t)q, q\u3009,\nwhich induces the quadratic form \u03c4C : H 1 T (0, T ) \u2192 R defined by\n\u03c4C(q) =\n\u222b T\n0\nLC(t, q(t), q\u0307(t)), \u2200 q \u2208 H1T (0, T ). (4.25)\nNoticing that A(t) is positive definite, for every t \u2208 [0, T ], the Morse index jC of \u03c4C is well-defined (cf. [1, Par. 3.4]) and the Morse index \u03b9(xC) of the circular solution xC is defined as jC .\nIn the following theorem we give the result on the computation of \u03b9(xC).\nTheorem 4.7. Let T > 0, k \u2208 N, with k \u2265 1, and iT \u2208 {0, . . . , k\u2212 1} such that (4.6) is fulfilled. Then, we have\n\u03b9(xC) = 2iT .\nProof. The proof is based on the arguments in [7] and [19]. Following [7], we first define\np = mx\u0307 \u221a\n1\u2212 |x\u0307| 2\nc2\nand \u2126 = (0,+\u221e)\u00d7 T1 \u00d7 R2;\nVia the diffeomorphism\n\u03a8: \u2126 \u2192 (R2 \\ {0})\u00d7 R2, (r, \u03d1, l,\u03a6) 7\u2192 (x, p),\ngiven by\nx = rei\u03d1, p = lei\u03d1 + \u03a6\nr iei\u03d1,\n(4.1) can be written in the form \n                 \n                 \nr\u0307 = \u2202lH0(r, \u03d1, l,\u03a6) = l\nm\n1 \u221a\n1 + l2 + \u03a62/r2\nm2c2\n,\n\u03d1\u0307 = \u2202\u03a6H0(r, \u03d1, l,\u03a6) = \u03a6 mr2 1 \u221a\n1 + l2 +\u03a62/r2\nm2c2\n,\nl\u0307 = \u2212\u2202rH0(r, \u03d1, l,\u03a6) = \u03a62 mr3 1 \u221a\n1 + l2 +\u03a62/r2\nm2c2\n\u2212 \u03b1 r2 ,\n\u03a6\u0307 = \u2212\u2202\u03d1H0(r, \u03d1, l,\u03a6) = 0,\n(4.26)\ncorresponding to the Hamiltonian\nH0(r, \u03d1, l,\u03a6) = mc2 \u221a 1 + l2 +\u03a62/r2\nm2c2 \u2212 \u03b1 r .\nIt is immediate to see that the circular solution xC given in (4.2) corresponds to \u03c2(t) = (R,\u03c9t, 0, L), t \u2208 [0, T ], where L is as in (4.3).\nAccording to the Morse index theorem [1, Cor. 3.4.2], we have\n\u03b9(xC) = i CZ(\u03b6; [0, T ]), (4.27)\nwhere \u03b6 is the fundamental matrix solution of the linearized system of (4.26) at \u03c2 and iCZ(\u03b6; [0, T ]) is its Conley-Zehnder index on the period [0, T ]. A standard computation shows that the linearized Hamiltonian system of (4.26) at \u03c2 is the linear system w\u0307 =Mw, where\nM =\n\n    \n0 0 A 0\nB 0 0 C\nD 0 0 \u2212B 0 0 0 0\n\n    \nwhere\nA = \u221a L2c2 \u2212 \u03b12 mLc , B = \u03b13m2(\u03b12 \u2212 2L2c2) L5(L2c2 \u2212 \u03b12) , C = \u03b12m \u221a L2c2 \u2212 \u03b12 L5c , D = \u2212 \u03b1 4m3c L5 \u221a L2c2 \u2212 \u03b12 .\nThe matrix M has the eigenvalues {0, 0,\u00b1i\u03c9\u2032}, where\n\u03c9\u2032 = \u03b12m\nL3 . (4.28)\nAccording to [19, Sect. 4.1], there exists a symplectic matrix P \u2208 Sp(4) such that\nM = P\n([\n0 sL\n0 0\n] \u22c4 [ 0 \u2212\u03c9\u2032\n\u03c9\u2032 0\n])\nP\u22121,\nfor some sL > 0. As a consequence, the Conley-Zehnder index of \u03b6 on the period [0, T ] is given by\niCZ(\u03b6; [0, T ]) = iCZ(\u03b7; [0, T ]) + iCZ(\u03be; [0, T ]), (4.29)\nwhere\n\u03b7(t) =\n[\n1 sLt\n0 1\n]\n, \u03be(t) = exp\n(\nt\n[\n0 \u2212\u03c9\u2032\n\u03c9\u2032 0\n])\n,\nfor every t \u2208 [0, T ]. Taking into account the fact that sL > 0, from [19, Lemma 3.7] we deduce that\niCZ(\u03b7; [0, T ]) = \u22121. (4.30)\nNow, from Proposition 2.10 and Lemma 3.5 in [19] we infer that\niCZ(\u03be; [0, T ]) =\n\n \n \n2 T\u03c9\u2032 2\u03c0 \u2212 1 if T\u03c9 \u2032 2\u03c0 \u2208 N 2 \u230aT\u03c9\u2032\n2\u03c0\n\u230b + 1 if T\u03c9\u2032\n2\u03c0 /\u2208 N.\n(4.31)\nNow, recalling (4.3) and (4.28), we have\nT\u03c9\u2032 2\u03c0 = T\u03b12m 2\u03c0L3 = k \u221a L2c2 \u2212 \u03b12 Lc = k \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1 2 L2c2 < k.\nAs a consequence, for n \u2208 {0, . . . , k \u2212 1} by means of an easy computation we deduce that\nn \u2264 T\u03c9 \u2032 2\u03c0 < n+ 1 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b1\n2 c2 k2 k2 \u2212 n2 \u2264 L 2 < \u03b12 c2 k2 k2 \u2212 (n+ 1)2 .\nUsing (4.3) and recalling (4.5), we conclude that\nn \u2264 T\u03c9 \u2032\n2\u03c0 < n+ 1 \u21d0\u21d2 ukn \u2264 T < ukn+1.\nAs a consequence, from (4.31) we deduce that\niCZ(\u03be; [0, T ]) =\n{\n2n\u2212 1 if T = ukn 2n+ 1 if T \u2208 (unk , un+1k ).\n(4.32)\nFrom (4.27), (4.29), (4.30) and (4.32) we obtain the result.\nRemark 4.8. Let us notice that if \u03b9(xC) \u2265 1 then xC is not minimal. Indeed, a simple computation shows that, as in the classical case, the Morse index \u03b9(xC) is equal to the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces relative to the negative eigenvalues of the periodic problem\n\n\n\nd dt (A(t)q\u0307) = B(t)q \u2212 \u03bbq\nq(0) = q(T ), q\u0307(0) = q\u0307(T ).\n(4.33)\nMoreover, \u03c4C(q) < 0 if q is a nontrivial function belonging to the direct sum of those eigenspaces, where \u03c4C is defined in (4.25). Therefore, if \u03b9(xC) \u2265 1, then there exists an eigenfunction q\u0304 \u2208 H1T (0, T ) associated to (4.33) and such that\n\u03c4C(q\u0304) < 0. (4.34)\nA regularity argument shows that q\u0304 \u2208 C1(0, T ), thus implying that xC + \u01ebq\u0304 \u2208 D\u03c8 \u2229\u039bk if \u01eb is sufficiently small (cf. Section 3.1 for the notation). Now, from Taylor\u2019s formula we deduce that\nI(xC + \u01ebq\u0304)\u2212 I(xC) = 1\n2 \u03c4C(q\u0304) \u01eb\n2 + o(\u01eb2), \u01eb\u2192 0.\nTaking into account (4.34), we conclude that xC is not minimal."

            "text": "We are now in a position to prove the result on the minimality of solutions of (4.1).\nTheorem 4.9. Let T > 0 and k \u2208 N, with k \u2265 1. Then, we have:\n1. if k = 1, for every T > 0 the minimal solution is the circular solution defined in (4.2);\n2. if k \u2265 2 and T \u2264 uk1 , the minimal solution is the circular solution defined in (4.2);\n3. if k \u2265 2 and T > uk1 , the minimal solution is the non-circular solution of type (1, k) given in Proposition 4.3.\nProof. We have already observed that for k = 1 the unique T -periodic solution in \u039bk is the circular solution. This is the situation also when k \u2265 2 and T \u2264 uk1 , which corresponds to the case iT = 0 in Proposition 4.3.\nIn the case k \u2265 2 and iT > 0, from Theorem 4.7 and Remark 4.8 we deduce that the circular solution cannot be minimal. Hence, the minimal solution is one of the non-circular solutions; Proposition 4.6 allows to conclude that the minimal solution is the solution of type (1, k).\nRemark 4.10. Let us observe, as a complement of the study of the values of the action functional, that when k \u2265 2 the action level of the circular solution is greater of all the levels of the existing non-circular solutions, at least for T sufficiently large.\nIndeed, let us first fix k \u2265 2 and observe that if T > ukk\u22121 then (4.1) has k \u2212 1 solutions of type (1, k), . . . , (k \u2212 1, k) (cf. Proposition 4.3). As a consequence, we can consider the action level of the solution x of type (n, k), for every n \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, which is given in (4.12).

            "text": "We begin by stating a deformation-tipe result which is easily adapted from the corresponding [21, Theorem 2.2].\nTheorem 5.1. Assume that I : X \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} satisfies Assumption 2.1, and that B,C \u2282 X are nonempty closed sets such that C is compact, C \u2282 DI and B \u2229 C = \u2205. If there is \u01eb > 0 such that\n\u2200 x \u2208 C \u2203 \u03bex \u2208 X : \u03a60(x; \u03bex \u2212 x) + \u03c8(\u03bex)\u2212 \u03c8(x) < \u2212\u01eb\u2016\u03bex \u2212 x\u2016, (5.1)\nthen, for every k > 1 there exist t0 \u2208 (0, 1], \u03b1 \u2208 C0([0, 1]\u00d7X,X) and \u03d5 \u2208 C0(X, [0,+\u221e)) which satisfy the following\n1. \u03b1(t,D\u03c8) \u2286 D\u03c8, \u2200 t \u2208 [0, t0); \u03b1(t, x) = x, \u2200 (t, x) \u2208 [0, t0)\u00d7B;\n2. \u2016\u03b1(t, x)\u2212 x\u2016 \u2264 kt, \u2200 (t, x) \u2208 [0, t0)\u00d7X;\n3. I(\u03b1(t, x)) \u2212 I(x) \u2264 \u2212\u01eb\u03d5(x)t, \u2200 (t, x) \u2208 [0, t0)\u00d7DI ;\n4. \u03d5(x) = 1, \u2200 x \u2208 C. Proof. First, we observe that (5.1) implies that, actually, \u03bex \u2208 D\u03c8 and \u03bex 6= x for all x \u2208 C. Next, the proof follows the argument of [21, Theorem 2.2] which, in fact, develops in a neighborhood of the compact set C. It is enough to observe that, for each fixed \u03bex, the function \u03a5 : D\u03a6 \u00d7X \u2192 R defined by\n\u03a5 (z, w) = \u03a60(z; \u03bex \u2212 w) + \u03c8(\u03bex)\u2212 \u03c8(w) + \u03b5\u2016\u03bex \u2212 w\u2016, \u2200 (z, w)inD\u03a6 \u00d7X,\nis upper semicontinuous on D\u03a6 \u00d7X and, by (5.1), negative for (z, w) = (x, x) \u2208 C \u00d7 C. Therefore, for each x \u2208 C it is possible to find a positive \u03b4x < \u2016\u03bex\u2212x\u2016 such that \u03a6 is Lipschitz continuous in B(x, \u03b4x) (see Assumption 2.1.3) and still\n\u03a60(z; \u03bex \u2212 w) + \u03c8(\u03bex)\u2212 \u03c8(w) + \u03b5\u2016\u03bex \u2212 w\u2016 < 0, \u2200 (z, w) \u2208 B(x, \u03b4x).\nFrom here one can continue as in the proof of [21, Theorem 2.2].\nWe now observe that we do not need the full extent of Assumption 2.1 to prove Theorem 5.1. In fact, Assumption 2.1.4 and the continuity of \u03c8 on the compact sets in which \u03c8 is bounded, in Assumption 2.1.2, are not used in the proof above. Moreover, we remark that the third statement of the deformation theorem grants that \u03b1(t,DI) \u2286 DI for all t \u2208 [0, t0).\nLet us come now to the proof of Theorem 2.4 and fix a few pieces of notation, in order to avoid the singularity of the functional. Thanks to Assumption 2.1.4, there is \u03b40 > 0 such that I(x) > c + 1 whenever x \u2208 DI and dist(x, \u2202D\u03a6) < 2\u03b40. We set D0 = {x \u2208 D\u03a6 : dist(x, \u2202D\u03a6) \u2265 2\u03b40}: hence, x \u2208 D0 whenever I(x) \u2264 c+ 1. From now on, the argument is almost identical to that of [21, Theorem 3.1] and we only need to check that it can be adjusted with the new assumptions on F and the singularity of I (see Assumption 2.1.4). It is enough to show that, if we fix any \u03b5 and any A\u03b5 \u2208 F such that\n0 < \u03b5 \u2264 min{1, \u03b40} and c \u2264 sup A\u03b5\nI < c+ \u03b52\n8 < c+ 1, (5.2)\nthen there exists x\u03b5 \u2208 X such that\n\u03a60(x\u03b5; z \u2212 x\u03b5) + \u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(x\u03b5) \u2265 \u22125\u03b5\u2016z \u2212 x\u03b5\u2016, \u2200 z \u2208 X ; dist(x\u03b5, A\u03b5) \u2264 \u03b5\n2 ;\nc\u2212 \u03b5 2\n8 \u2264 I(x\u03b5) \u2264 c+\n5 2 \u03b52;\ndist(x\u03b5, F ) \u2264 3\n2 \u03b5 if, moreover, inf F I = c.\nIn particular, (5.2) guarantess that A\u03b5 \u2282 DI \u2229D0. Assumptions 2 and 3 of the theorem imply that infF I \u2264 c and, thus, we split the argument into two cases.\nThe first case: infF I = c.\nWe denote N\u03b5(F ) = {x \u2208 X : dist(x, F ) < \u03b5} and G\u03b5 = ({0} \u00d7X) \u222a ([0, 1]\u00d7 ((A\u03b5 \\N\u01eb(F )) \u222aB)). Let \u03b7(t, x) = x for all (t, x) \u2208 [0, 1]\u00d7X and\nL\u03b5 := { \u03b7 \u2208 C0([0, 1]\u00d7X,X) : \u03b7(t, x) = x \u2200(t, x) \u2208 G\u03b5 and \u03c1(\u03b7, \u03b7) \u2264 \u03b40 } ,\nwhich is a complete metric space with respect to the distance \u03c1(\u03b71, \u03b72) := sup{\u2016\u03b71(t, x) \u2212 \u03b72(t, x)\u2016 : (t, x) \u2208 [0, 1]\u00d7X}. Observe that, by construction, \u03b7([0, 1]\u00d7A\u03b5) \u2282 D\u03a6 for all \u03b7 \u2208 L\u03b5, that ({0} \u00d7X) \u222a ([0, 1]\u00d7B) \u2282 G\u03b5 and, thus, \u03b7(1, A\u03b5) \u2208 F by hypothesis 1 of the theorem. We define for x \u2208 X :\nf1(x) = max{0, \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b5 dist(x, F )}\nf2(x) = min\n{\n\u03b52\n8 , \u03b5 dist(x, (A\u03b5 \\N\u03b5(F )) \u222aB)\n}\ng(x) = I(x) + f1(x) + f2(x)\nand consider the functional J : L\u03b5 \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} given by\nJ(\u03b7) = sup z\u2208\u03b7(1,A\u03b5) g(z) = sup x\u2208A\u03b5\ng(\u03b7(1, x)), \u2200 \u03b7 \u2208 L\u03b5.\nLet us observe that J is l.s.c. since it is the supremum of a family of l.s.c. functions. For every \u03b7 \u2208 L\u03b5, there exists z0 \u2208 \u03b7(1, A\u03b5) \u2229 F by assumption 3, since \u03b7(1, A\u03b5) \u2208 F , and, thus\nJ(\u03b7) \u2265 g(z0) \u2265 I(z0) + f1(z0) = I(z0) + \u03b52 \u2265 inf F I + \u03b52 = c+ \u03b52.\nHence, c+ \u03b52 \u2264 inf\n\u03b7\u2208L\u03b5 J(\u03b7).\nOn the other hand, by (5.2) we have:\ninf \u03b7\u2208L\u03b5 J(\u03b7) \u2264 J(\u03b7) = sup A\u03b5\n(I + f1 + f2) \u2264 c+ \u03b52\n8 + \u03b52 +\n\u03b52\n8 \u2264 inf \u03b7\u2208L\u03b5 J(\u03b7) +\n\u03b52\n4 . (5.3)\nBy Ekeland\u2019s variational principle, there exists \u03b70 \u2208 L\u03b5 such that\nJ(\u03b70) \u2264 J(\u03b7); \u03c1(\u03b70, \u03b7) \u2264 \u03b5\n2 ; J(\u03b7) \u2265 J(\u03b70)\u2212\n\u03b5 2 \u03c1(\u03b7, \u03b70), \u2200\u03b7 \u2208 L\u03b5. (5.4)\nWe have that \u03c8 is bounded from above on \u03b70(1, A\u03b5), since\nsup \u03b70(1,A\u03b5) \u03c8 \u2264 sup \u03b70(1,A\u03b5) I \u2212 inf \u03b70(1,A\u03b5) \u03a6 \u2264 J(\u03b70)\u2212 min \u03b70(1,A\u03b5) \u03a6 \u2264 J(\u03b7)\u2212 min \u03b70(1,A\u03b5) \u03a6,\nand, thus, \u03c8 is continuous on \u03b70(1, A\u03b5) by Assumption 2.1.2. In particular, the function x 7\u2192 g(\u03b70(1, x)) is continuous on A\u03b5 and the set C = {w \u2208 \u03b70(1, A\u03b5) : g(w) = sup g(\u03b70(1, A\u03b5))} is non-empty and compact. Now, let z\u0302 \u2208 \u03b70(1, A\u03b5) \u2229 F satisfy I(z\u0302) = sup I(\u03b70(1, A\u03b5) \u2229 F ): either z\u0302 6\u2208 B or we have\nI(z\u0302) \u2264 sup B I \u2264 inf F I \u2264 I(z) \u2264 sup\n\u03b70(1,A\u03b5)\u2229F\nI, \u2200 z \u2208 (\u03b70(1, A\u03b5) \u2229 F ) \\B.\nIn both cases there is z0 \u2208 (\u03b70(1, A\u03b5) \u2229 F ) \\B such that I(z0) = sup I(\u03b70(1, A\u03b5) \u2229 F ) and, thus,\nmax \u03b70(1,A\u03b5)\ng \u2265 g(z0) = I(z0) + \u03b52 + f2(z0) \u2265 c+ \u03b52 + f2(z0) > c+ \u03b52,\nwhere we used the fact that f2(z0) > 0 and I(z0) \u2265 c, since z0 \u2208 F . On the other hand, we have that:\nz \u2208 A\u03b5 \\N\u03b5(F ) =\u21d2 g(z) = I(z) \u2264 sup A\u03b5\nI < c+ \u03b52\n8 ;\nz \u2208 B =\u21d2 g(z) = I(z) + f1(z) \u2264 sup B I + \u03b52 \u2264 c+ \u03b52.\nHence, C \u2229 [(A\u03b5 \\N\u03b5(F )) \u222aB] = \u2205. We make the following\nClaim. There exists x\u03b5 \u2208 C such that: \u03a60(x\u03b5; z \u2212 x\u03b5) + \u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(x\u03b5) \u2265 \u22125\u03b5\u2016z \u2212 x\u03b5\u2016, \u2200 z \u2208 X . Assuming that the claim is proven, we have that x\u03b5 6\u2208 B. Moreover, x\u03b5 = \u03b70(1, x\u0302) for some x\u0302 \u2208 A\u03b5: in fact, x\u0302 \u2208 N\u03b5(F ) because, otherwise, we would have x\u0302 \u2208 A\u03b5 \\ N\u03b5(F ) and, thus, x\u03b5 = x\u0302, since \u03b70 \u2208 L\u03b5, that is a contradiction with C \u2229 [(A\u03b5 \\N\u03b5(F )) \u222aB] = \u2205. Therefore, we deduce that\ndist(x\u03b5, A\u03b5) \u2264 \u2016\u03b70(1, x\u0302)\u2212 x\u0302\u2016 \u2264 \u03c1(\u03b70, \u03b7) \u2264 \u03b5\n2 ;\ndist(x\u03b5, F ) \u2264 \u2016\u03b70(1, x\u0302)\u2212 \u03b7(1, x\u0302)\u2016+ dist(x\u0302, F ) \u2264 \u03c1(\u03b70, \u03b7) + \u03b5 2 \u2264 3 2 \u03b5.\nFinally, from (5.3) we infer\nI(x\u03b5) \u2264 g(x\u03b5) = J(\u03b70) \u2264 J(\u03b7) = sup A\u03b5 g \u2264 c+ 5 4 \u03b52\nand\nI(x\u03b5) = J(\u03b70)\u2212 f1(x\u03b5)\u2212 f2(x\u03b5) \u2265 inf L\u03b5\nJ \u2212 \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b5 2 8 \u2265 c\u2212 \u03b5 2 8 .\nLet us finally prove the remaining claim. By contradition, if the claim is false, we have that (5.1) holds with 5\u03b5 in place of \u03b5 and we can apply Theorem 5.1 with B\u2032 = (A\u03b5 \\N\u03b5(F )) \u222aB in place of B and any k \u2208 (1, 2). We fix any t1 \u2208 (0, t0) such that t1 \u2264 \u03b5/(2k), too, and define\n\u03b7\u03bb(t, x) = \u03b1(\u03bbt, \u03b70(t, x)), \u2200 (t, x) \u2208 [0, 1]\u00d7X, \u2200 \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1].\nUsing statements 1 and 2 of Theorem 5.1 it is straightforward to check that \u03b7\u03bb(t, x) = x for all (t, x) \u2208 G\u03b5 and all \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1]. Moreover, we have\n\u2016\u03b7\u03bb(t, x)\u2212x\u2016 \u2264 \u2016\u03b1(\u03bbt, \u03b70(t, x))\u2212\u03b70(t, x)\u2016+\u2016\u03b70(t, x)\u2212x\u2016 \u2264 kt1+ \u03b5\n2 \u2264 \u03b41, \u2200 (t, x) \u2208 [0, 1]\u00d7X, \u2200 \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1],\nagain by statement 2 of Theorem 5.1 and the choiches for t1 and \u01eb. Therefore we can deduce that \u03b7\u03bb \u2208 L\u03b5 and that \u03c1(\u03b7\u03bb, \u03b70) \u2264 \u03bbk, for every \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1]. Hence, by (5.4) we have that\nJ(\u03b7\u03bb) \u2265 J(\u03b70)\u2212 e\n2 \u03c1(\u03b7\u03bb, \u03b70) \u2265 J(\u03b70)\u2212\n\u03b5\u03bbk\n2 \u2200\u03bb \u2208 [0, t1]. (5.5)\nBy statement 3 in Theorem 5.1, we deduce that\nI(\u03b7\u03bb(1, x)) \u2264 I(\u03b70(1, x))\u2212 5\u03b5\u03bb\u03d5(\u03b70(1, x)), \u2200 x \u2208 A\u03b5, \u2200 \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1],\nand, thus, sup\n\u03b7\u03bb(1,A\u03b5)\nI \u2264 J(\u03b70)\u2212 5\u03b5\u03bb min \u03b70(1,A\u03b5) \u03d5 < +\u221e.\nArguing as above, this guarantees that \u03c8 is continuous on \u03b7\u03bb(1, A\u03b5) and that also the function x 7\u2192 g(\u03b7\u03bb(1, x)) is continuous on A\u03b5: let x\u03bb \u2208 A\u03b5 be such that g(\u03b7\u03bb(1, x\u03bb)) = J(\u03b7\u03bb). Inequality (5.5) implies that\ng(\u03b7\u03bb(1, x\u03bb))\u2212 g(\u03b70(1, x)) \u2265 J(\u03b70)\u2212 g(\u03b70(1, x))\u2212 \u03b5\u03bbk 2 \u2265 \u2212\u03b5\u03bbk 2 , \u2200 x \u2208 A\u03b5, \u2200 \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1]. (5.6)\nNow, recalling that the functions f1 and f2 have both Lipschitz constant \u03b5, we deduce that\nI(\u03b7\u03bb(1, x\u03bb)) \u2212 I(\u03b70(1, x\u03bb)) \u2265 g(\u03b7\u03bb(1, x\u03bb))\u2212 g(\u03b70(1, x\u03bb))\u2212 2\u03b5\u2016\u03b7\u03bb(1, x\u03bb)\u2212 \u03b70(1, x\u03bb)\u2016 \u2265 \u2212 5\n2 \u03b5\u03bbk,\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1]. Moreover, again by statement 2 of Theorem 5.1, we have that\nI(\u03b7\u03bb(1, x\u03bb))\u2212 I(\u03b70(1, x\u03bb)) \u2264 \u22125\u03b5\u03bb\u03d5(\u03b70(1, x\u03bb)).\nThe last two inequalities together give that\n\u03d5(\u03b70(1, x\u03bb)) \u2264 k\n2 < 1. (5.7)\nOn the other hand, if we denote by x\u0302 \u2208 A\u03b5 any cluster point of {x\u03bb : \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1]} as \u03bb \u2192 0+, we observe that, again, the map (\u03bb, x) 7\u2192 g(\u03b7\u03bb(1, x)) is continuous on the closure of {(\u03bb, x\u03bb) : \u03bb \u2208 [0, t1]} \u2282 [0, t1]\u00d7A\u03b5 and we let \u03bb\u2192 0+ in (5.6) to obtain:\ng(\u03b70(1, x\u0302))\u2212 g(\u03b70(1, x)) \u2265 0, \u2200 x \u2208 A\u03b5;\nthis means that, actually, \u03b70(1, x\u0302) \u2208 C and, thus, \u03d5(\u03b70(1, x\u0302)) = 1 by statement 4 of Theorem 5.1. This, however, contradicts (5.7) and the claim is proved.\nThe second case: infF I < c.\nThe argument in this case can be simplified since we do not seek a PS-sequence that approaches F anymore. We set\nL = {\u03b7 \u2208 C([0, 1]\u00d7X,X) : \u03b7(t, x) = x, \u2200 (t, x) \u2208 ({0} \u00d7X) \u222a ([0, 1]\u00d7B); \u03c1(\u03b7, \u03b7) \u2264 \u03b40}.\nAgain, we have that (L, \u03c1) is a complete metric space and \u03b7(1, A\u03b5) \u2208 F for all \u03b7 \u2208 L. The functional J : L \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e], given by J(\u03b7) = sup f(\u03b7(1, A\u03b5)), is l.s.c. and satisfies\nc \u2264 inf L J \u2264 J(\u03b7) < c+ \u03b5\n2\n4 \u2264 inf L J +\n\u03b52\n4 .\nThus, there exists \u03b70 \u2208 L such that (5.4) holds with L in place of L\u03b5. As in the previous case, \u03c8 is bounded from above on \u03b70(1, A\u03b5) and, using Assumption 2.1.2, we can consider the nonempty and compact set C = {w \u2208 \u03b70(1, A\u03b5) : f(w) = max I(\u03b70(1, A\u03b5))}. Moreover, B \u2229 C = \u2205 since\nsup B I \u2264 inf B I < c \u2264 inf C I\nand we can use again Theorem 5.1 to show that there exists x\u03b5 \u2208 C such that\n\u03a60(x\u03b5, z \u2212 x\u03b5) + \u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8(x\u03b5) \u2265 \u2212\u03b5\u2016z \u2212 x\u03b5\u2016, \u2200 z \u2208 X.\nThe first inequality in (5.4) ensures that\nc \u2264 inf C I \u2264 I(x\u03b5) = J(\u03b70) \u2264 J(\u03b7) < c+\n\u03b52\n4 ,\nwhile the second one implies that dist(x\u03b5, A\u03b5) \u2264 \u03b5/2.\nAcknowledgments.
