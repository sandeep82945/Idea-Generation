 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on parallel fully dynamic algorithms for distance queries on dynamic graphs:

1. Explore more efficient methods to select landmarks in dynamic graphs. The current method uses random selection which may not be optimal as the graph structure changes over time. Research could explore landmark selection methods that adapt to changes in graph structure.

2. Investigate approximate distance labelling techniques to further improve efficiency and scalability. The current method focuses on exact distance queries. Approximate techniques could allow for more compact labellings and faster updates.

3. Extend the parallel fully dynamic framework to other graph queries beyond shortest path distance, such as reachability, closest pairs, and graph pattern matching.

4. Develop incremental optimization techniques to periodically refine the labelling over time rather than fully recompute it from scratch. This could further amortize the cost of updates.

5. Explore distributed and decentralized versions of the parallel fully dynamic framework that can scale to massive distributed graphs. This could involve partitioning the graph and distributed storage of landmarks and labels.
