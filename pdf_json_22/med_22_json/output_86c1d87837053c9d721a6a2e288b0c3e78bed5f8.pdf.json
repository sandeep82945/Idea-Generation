Because propagation in shallow water is greatly influenced by the geoacoustic properties of the sediment layer, accurate estimates of the geoacoustic parameters are required to understand the transmission properties of underwater sound. A sediment attenuation coefficient is a key geoacoustic parameter, but measuring it is more difficult compared with other parameters. In general, direct measurements1\u20133 have been used to estimate the sediment attenuation coefficient in areas of interest; however, this requires considerable time and effort, and a mismatch between the frequency of interest and the frequency used in the direct measurements can reduce the accuracy of the estimate. Many attempts have been made to inversely estimate the sediment attenuation coefficient through acoustic propagation experiments.4\u20136\nIn our previous study,7 bottom loss as a function of grazing angle was estimated using 4 12 kHz bottominteracting signals acquired at two sites (sites 1 and 2) in October 2015 and August 2016, respectively, at the entrance to Jinhae Bay in Southeast Korea. Although the two sites\nwere less than 20 km apart, the composition of the surficial sediments of sites 1 and 2 differed. At site 1, which was composed mainly of mud, the angle of intromission was observed near the grazing angle of 20 in bottom-loss data expressed as a function of grazing angle. In contrast, at site 2, which was composed mainly of sand, a typical bottom loss with a critical angle was observed. By comparing the measured bottom-loss data and Rayleigh reflection model predictions, geoacoustic parameters, such as sound speed, density, and attenuation coefficient of the surficial sediment, were estimated for the two sites, which were 1445.5 6 2.2 m/s, 1351.8 6 10.1 kg=m3; and 0.42 6 0.01 dB/m/kHz, respectively, for site 1 and 1569.7 6 1.0 m/s, 1859.4 6 13.7 kg=m3; and 0.12 6 0.03 dB/m/kHz, respectively, for site 2. In some datasets with a center frequency of 4\u20138 kHz at site 1, where the surficial sediment was composed of mud, signals reflected from the sub-bottom interface arrived immediately after the signal reflected from the water-bottom interface, and this signal vanished into background noise levels at frequencies over approximately 10 kHz. Surficial sediment thickness was estimated to be 3.8 6 0.3 m by comparing the measured values and predictions of the arrival time differences between the bottom-reflected and subbottom\u2013reflected arrivals.\nFor site 1, it was difficult to accurately estimate the bottom loss corresponding to the grazing angles around the angle of intromission due to a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The estimate of the sediment attenuation a)Also at: Department of Military Information Engineering, Hanyang University-ERICA, Ansan, Gyeonggido 15588, Republic of Korea.

We therefore re-estimated the sediment attenuation coefficient using acoustic data from two additional sea experiments.\nThe first follow-up experiment, conducted in May 2016, was not intended as an acoustic experiment for the purposes of the present study, but as an underwater communication experiment. The sediment attenuation coefficient was estimated using the probe signals of underwater communication sequences, which were linear frequencymodulated (LFM) signals 60 ms\u2013long with center frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz and bandwidths of 6 and 8 kHz, respectively. The second follow-up experiment, conducted in September 2020, involved the transmission of continuous wave (CW) and LFM signals to produce bottom-interacting signals. The CW signals were in a range of 3\u201310 kHz with a 500 Hz interval; the LFM signals were composed of center frequencies of 6 and 6.5 kHz with pulse lengths of 1 and 2 s and bandwidths of 4 and 7 kHz, respectively. Both experiments were performed within 100 m of site 1 of our previous study.7 As in our earlier study, the bottom reflection signal and sub-bottom reflection signal were observed in succession. These arrival signals are referred to hereafter as B-path (bottom reflection) and SB-path (sub-bottom reflection). Similar observations were made at the research site of the Shallow Water \u201906 experiment, in which signals reflected from an R-reflector at a nominal depth of 22 m below the seafloor were received. Geoacoustic inversions were attempted using these signals.8,9\nIn this paper, the estimated sediment attenuation coefficient is based on the difference in signal amplitude between the B-path and SB-path arrivals at different frequencies for the same source\u2013receiver geometry, following a method proposed by Jiang et al. (2009).9 The estimated sediment attenuation coefficients are then compared with attenuation coefficients obtained in situ using a device that directly measures the geoacoustic parameters by inserting four stakes into the sediment."

            "text": "Additional acoustic experiments to estimate the sediment attenuation coefficient were carried out twice, in May 2016 and September 2020, at the entrance to Jinhae Bay, off the east coast of Geoje Island southeast of Korea; the locations were near site 1, where an angle of intromission was identified in our previous study7 (Fig. 1). The surficial sediment was composed mainly of very fine particles of less than 5 /, and the mean grain size was 7.3 /. Figure 2 depicts the experimental geometry of each measurement, and the sound speed profiles (SSP) obtained by conductivity\u2013temperature\u2013depth (CTD) casts (AML Oceanographic, British Columbia, Canada) on a vessel with a receiver array during the experiment. Although the SSP were measured only at the receiver position, it was assumed to be range independent since the source\u2013receiver range was only a few hundred meters.\nThe first experiment was conducted at 34 48.860 N, 128 47.3220 E, approximately 90 m southwest of site 1 (34 48.9060 N, 128 47.340 E). A vertical receiver array consisting of four B&K 8106 omnidirectional hydrophones (Bruel\n4292 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151 (6), June 2022 Kwon et al.\n25 January 2024 21:33:44\n& Kjaer, Naerum, Denmark) was deployed on the R/V Nara, which was fixed in place by anchoring, and a D/11 (Neptune Sonar Limited, Kelk, United Kingdom) omnidirectional transducer was deployed on a small fishing vessel. The horizontal distance between the two vessels was kept at approximately 208 m by connecting the sterns with a rope, and monitored by a differential global positioning system (DGPS) (GPS850; Ascen, Seoul, Korea) installed on the sterns of each vessel. The sound source was alternately located at depths of 30 and 45 m, and the receiver array of four channels was located from 15 to 45 m at intervals of 10 m. The seafloor was relatively flat from the sound source to the receiver, and the water depths were approximately 57 and 58 m at the source and vertical receiver array positions, respectively. The sound speed profile in the water column deeper than the sound source depth was nearly constant with depth. The source signals were 60 ms\u2013long LFM pulses used as probe signals for underwater communication. Two types of LFM pulses were used as probe signals; the frequency ranges were 1\u20137 kHz and 4\u201312 kHz, and hereinafter, these signals are referred to as LFM-1 and LFM-2, respectively. Each signal was repeatedly transmitted 10 times with a repetition period of 15 s for each experimental set.\nThe LFM signals received by each hydrophone were matched filtered with the FM replicas. In the matched-filtered signals, the direct path, bottom-reflected, and sea surface\u2013 reflected signals were well separated in time. Similar to the results presented in our previous paper,7 the SB-path signals were clearly seen at combinations of sound source and receiver depths of 30 45, 45 35, and 45\u201345 m. Figure 3 shows the matched-filtered outputs for 10 repetitions, aligned with respect to the direct-path arrivals and\ntheir ensemble average for nominal source and receiver depths of 45 m and a horizontal range of 208 m (from the May 2016 experiment). The SB-path was received approximately 1.7 ms after the B-path.\nThe thickness of the surficial sediment layer at the first follow-up experiment site was re-estimated to be 3.8 6 0.2 m by comparing the travel time differences between the Band SB-paths and those predicted by ray-based propagation code using the sediment sound speed (1445.5 m/s) estimated in our previous study.7\nThe second experiment was conducted in September 2020 at 34 48.9090 N, 128 47.3590 E, approximately 30 m\nJ.

The experimental geometry was similar to that of the first follow-up experiment, except for the depths and horizontal ranges of the source and receiver. The D/11 omnidirectional transducer and four-channel receiver array were each deployed on two small fishing vessels. The four-channel receiver array consisted of two TC-4014 omnidirectional hydrophones (Reson, Denmark) and two TC-4032 omnidirectional hydrophones (Reson, Denmark). The horizontal distances between the two vessels were between 145 and 205 m. As in the previous experiments, the distances were maintained by connecting the sterns with a rope, and monitored by a DGPS device. The four-channel receiver array was located across depths of 30\u201345 m at spacing of 5 m. The sound source was alternately located at 45 and 50 m. The seafloor from the sound source to the receiver was relatively flat, with a nominal water depth of approximately 58 m. SSP measured by CTD casts during the experiments exhibited downward refraction, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The source signals consisted of two LFM pulses that are different in center frequencies, bandwidths, and also pulse lengths and fifteen 1 ms\u2013long CW pulses at different frequencies. For the two LFM pulses, the frequency range and pulse duration was 4\u20138 kHz and 1 s, respectively (hereafter referred to as LFM-3), and 3\u201310 kHz and 2 s, respectively (hereafter LFM-4). The center frequencies of the CW pulses ranged between 3 and 10 kHz with a 500 Hz interval. Each pulse was repeatedly transmitted 20 times in the order listed above. The thickness of the surficial sediment layer at the second experiment site was also reestimated to be 3.9 6 0.2 m using the sediment sound speed of 1445.5 m/s from the dataset in which the B- and SB-paths were clearly separated in time.\nAmong the datasets corresponding to the 16 geometries obtained in both experiments, the sets in which the SB-path signal was observed immediately after the B-path signal were selected to estimate the sediment attenuation coefficient. A total of nine sets consisting of five LFM datasets from the May 2016 experiment and four sets from the September 2020 experiment (two sets each for CW and LFM) were used for inversion of the sediment attenuation coefficient. For each dataset, the thickness of the surficial sediment layer corresponding to each dataset was reestimated using the time difference between the B- and SBpath signals. This thickness value was then used to estimate the attenuation coefficient for each case.\nFigures 4(a) and 4(b) show 20 received CW signals of 4 kHz aligned with respect to the direct-path arrivals, and their ensemble average for nominal source and receiver depths of 45 m and a horizontal range of approximately 145 m acquired during the September 2020 experiment, respectively. It is of interest to note that the amplitude of the Bpath is smaller than that of the SB-path. This is discussed in detail in Sec. IV."

Second, because the distance between the source and receiver is relatively short, as shown in the eigenray tracing result in Fig. 5, the refraction effect is also negligible. In addition, the difference in aw for a frequency range of 2\u201312 kHz is predicted to be less than 0.001 dB/m,13 which is negligible. Thus, the term B in Eq.

Nine sets consisting of five LFM datasets from the May 2016 measurements and two each of the CW and LFM datasets from the September 2020 measurements were selected to estimate the sediment attenuation coefficient. In the case of CW signals, the received signals were bandpass filtered at the center frequencies with a filter bandwidth of 61 kHz to remove noise. For the analysis of the LFM signals, we followed the dataprocessing procedure used by Jiang et al. (2009).9 First, the received LFM signals were matched-filtered, and the signal envelopes were extracted. Then, the envelope signals were aligned with respect to the B-path arrivals and the matchedfiltered outputs were time-aligned based on the offsets used. Next, the compressed signals were filtered with a series of bandpass filters to obtain the amplitude difference between the B-path and SB-path signals as a function of frequency. The center frequencies and bandwidths of the bandpass filters were chosen based on multiple attempts to ensure that the filtered signals had a sufficient time resolution to distinguish between the two path arrivals. Center frequencies and bandwidths of the bandpass filters used in the analysis for the May 2016 and September 2020 experiments are listed in Table I. The amplitude ratio (in dB) between the B-path and SB-path was estimated by taking 10 times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of total energy measures, based on an integral over a time window corresponding to each path.\nFigure 6 provides the amplitude ratios (in dB) of Pb and Psb for five LFM datasets from the May 2016 experiment,\nTABLE I.

The results from nominally same geometries were grouped. The data points with low SNR or unclear path-by-path signal separation were excluded. To investigate the uncertainty on the data points, statistical fluctuations in the level of the amplitude ratio of the B- and SB-path signals were estimated based on a 10-ping average for the 2016 experiment and a 20-ping average for the 2020 experiment. The error bars of the data points correspond to standard deviation due to fluctuations in the amplitude ratio of the two paths. For every case, the amplitude ratio appears to increase linearly with frequency in the frequency band corresponding to each pulse type. Therefore, the sediment attenuation based on a linear relationship with frequency was estimated; that is, m \u00bc 1 in Eq. (2). Slight slope differences were observed even with nominally same geometry, which may occur due to variation in the source and receiver depths and the horizontal distance between the source and receiver due to environmental variation.\nThe slope of the amplitude ratio with frequency corresponds to the product of b in Eq. (2) and r5 \u00fe r6, as shown in Eq. (1). The constant b is a sediment attenuation coefficient in dB/m/kHz. The weighted least squares method was used to find the line that best fit the data. The inverse of the estimated variances of each data point was used as the weighting factor. Finally, the sediment attenuation coefficient b was estimated by dividing the estimated slope by r5 \u00fe r6. The propagation range in the surficial sediment of the SB-path, r5 \u00fe r6, was predicted by a ray-based sound propagation code using the water sound speed profile measured by CTD casts, the surficial sediment sound speed (1445.5 m/s) estimated in Ref. 7, and the thickness of the surficial sediment layer re-estimated for each dataset. Finally, the sediment attenuation coefficient (dB/m/kHz) for each experimental geometry were estimated by dividing the estimated slope by r5 \u00fe r6, and the results are summarized in Table II.\nMonte Carlo simulation was performed to investigate the uncertainty of estimated sediment attenuation due to geoacoustic parameter uncertainty. Search spaces of geoacoustic\nparameters were determined by the uncertainty ranges of geoacoustic parameters reported in Ref. 7 except for the thickness of the surficial sediment. The search space of the sediment thickness was 3.0\u20134.5 m, which exceeded the range\n4296 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151 (6), June 2022 Kwon et al.\nof thickness re-estimated in this paper for each experimental dataset case. The error range of the sediment attenuation coefficient due to the uncertainty of geoacoustic parameters was estimated to be less than 0.03 dB/m/kHz for every case, which was negligible compared to fluctuations in the amplitude ratio of the B- and SB-path signals.\nLast, as shown in Fig. 4, cases in which the amplitude of the B-path was smaller than that of the SB-path were observed in our datasets. This is possible when the value of 20 log10B in Eq. (1) is less than as f\u00f0 \u00de r5 \u00fe r6\u00f0 \u00de. As frequency increases, the amplitude of SB-path gradually decreases due to sediment attenuation that increases with frequency. For this reason, in our case, this was mainly observed at frequencies below 6 kHz. Figure 7 shows the average intensities based on a 20-ping average as a function of frequency for the same geometry as Fig. 4. It can be seen that the amplitude of the SB-path continuously decreases with frequency, and thus, the amplitude of the B-path becomes larger than that of the SB-path from 7 kHz.\nV. IN SITU MEASUREMENTS OF SEDIMENT ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS\nTo verify the estimated sediment attenuation coefficients, measurements of sediment attenuation were taken in situ at stations A (34 48.9060 N, 128 47.3400 E) and B (34 49.0040 N, 128 47.4500 E) in September 2020 (Fig. 1). Figure 8(a) shows the geoacoustic parameter measurement system used to measure sediment attenuation in situ. This system consisted of a geoacoustic INvestigation of SEdiments by Acoustics (INSEA) measuring instrument [Fig. 8(b); RTsys, Caudan, France], monitoring camera (GoPro Heros3\u00fe; GoPro Inc., San Mateo, CA), light-emitting diode (LED; GPH21750M; Group B Distribution Inc., Jensen Beach, FL),\nconductivity-temperature (CT) sensor (Duo CT; RBR, Ottawa, Canada), and a mounting frame. The INSEA instrument uses a Gaussian tone burst signal with an interval of 200 ls to measure attenuation in the sediment. A hydraulic winch with an armored wire cable moved the system into the water. When the system reached the sea bottom, the INSEA instrument was dropped to the bottom, causing its four stake transducers to penetrate into the sediment, as shown in Fig. 8(c). The transmission and reception of acoustic waves with the stake transducers are automatically controlled by an INSEA programming function. The frequencies used for sediment attenuation estimates in this study ranged from 120 to 180 kHz with a frequency interval of 10 kHz. Each stake transducer alternately transmits a signal to the others and receives signals from two stake transducers located opposite each other. However, because stake transducer sC of the INSEA instrument failed during the experiment, only stakes, sA , sB , and sD were used for the in situ measurements of sediment attenuation. Four acoustic wave paths,sA !sD ;sD !sA , sB !sD ; and sD !sB , were used for sediment attenuation measurements. Figure 8(d) depicts the geometry of the transmission and reception of acoustic waves with the stake transducers. The acoustic signals transmitted between stakes transducers were stored on a secure digital (SD) card in the INSEA instrument; the data were then transferred to a personal computer via a file transfer protocol for offline analysis. Figure 9 shows an example of the received signals measured in the water column just above the sediment and in the sediment using a center frequency of 120 kHz. The sediment attenuation in dB/m is obtained as the difference in acoustic energy of these two signals divided by the distance between the two stake transducers.\nFigure 10 shows sediment attenuation (dB/m) as a function of frequency in a frequency range of 120\u2013180 kHz measured by the INSEA instrument at stations A and B.\nJ.

The error bars of the data points correspond to standard deviation of sediment attenuation estimated for the four acoustic paths between the stakes, which were used as weights to find the best-fit lines. The best-fit sediment attenuation coefficients for stations A and B, which represent the slope in the attenuationfrequency graph, were both close to 0.13 dB/m/kHz."

By comparing the measured bottom loss and model predictions obtained using a Rayleigh bottom-loss model for a homogeneous fluid half-space, the sediment attenuation coefficient was estimated to be 0.42 dB/m/kHz. The thick solid line in Fig. 11 is the model curve corresponding to an attenuation coefficient of 0.42 dB/m/kHz. However, this value seemed unreliable due to the low SNR of the B-path. In this paper, by comparing the amplitudes of the B-path and SB-path signals based on the geoacoustic information,\nFIG. 10. (Color online) Sediment attenuation (dB/m) versus frequency at a range of 120 180 kHz. Sediment attenuation coefficients (dB/m/kHz) for stations A (red squares) and B (blue circles) were approximately 0.13 dB/m/kHz in both cases by linear fitting to the data points.\n4298 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151 (6), June 2022 Kwon et al.\n25 January 2024 21:33:44\nthe sediment attenuation coefficient was re-estimated to be 0.156 0.03 dB/m/kHz. Thin solid and thin dashed lines in Fig. 11 are the model predictions obtained using the attenuation coefficients of 0.11 and 0.19 dB/m/kHz, respectively, which were the lower and upper limits of the values estimated in this study.\nThe measurements of sediment attenuation were taken in situ by repeatedly transmitting and receiving 120 180 kHz CW signals at the four stake transducers embedded in the sediment. Although the frequency bands used for the in situ measurement and the inversion process of the sediment attenuation were different, the sediment attenuations in each frequency range, measured in muddy sediment, showed a linear trend with frequency. In addition, the in situ measurement results (0.13 dB/m/kHz) were within the range of sediment attenuation coefficients obtained by comparing the amplitudes of the B-path and SB-path signals. In the inversion method used in this study, except for the sediment attenuation, the frequency dependence of physical phenomena on the acoustic interactions with the sediment layer (such as reflection, refraction, and transmission) was assumed to be negligible. This assumption may have caused uncertainty when estimating the sediment attenuation coefficients. The in situ measurement by INSEA measured the sediment attenuation only for a sediment depth of 17 cm, which is the depth of the transducers embedded in the sediment layer, whereas the inversion results in this paper were obtained from the signals that propagated through the entire surficial sediment layer. Last, the comparison of sediment attenuation coefficients for different frequency bands performed in this paper does not imply a linear frequency relationship of sediment attenuation coefficients within the frequency range from a few kHz to 100 kHz."
