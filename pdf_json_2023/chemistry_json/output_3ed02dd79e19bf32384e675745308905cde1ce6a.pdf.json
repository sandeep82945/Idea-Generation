    "abstractText": "35 Melanoma associated antigen 4 (MAGEA4) is a cancer-testis antigen (CTA) that is primarily 36 expressed in the testes of healthy adults but is aberrantly overexpressed and also a poor 37 prognostic marker in several human cancers. In its cancer-specific role, MAGEA4 interacts 38 with RAD18 and activates trans-lesion DNA synthesis (TLS), potentially favouring tumour 39 evolution. However, the precise mode of interaction between RAD18 and MAGEA4 and its 40 implications on the ubiquitination activity of RAD18 are unknown. Here, we employed NMR 41 and AlphaFold2 (AF) to reveal that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme RAD6-binding domain 42 (R6BD) of RAD18 interacts with a groove in the C-terminal winged-helix subdomain (WH) 43 of MAGEA4. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), we found that MAGEA4 44 displaces RAD6 from the R6BD of RAD18 and inhibits degradative autoubiquitination of 45 RAD18, which could be countered by a competing short peptide of the RAD18 R6B region. 46 AF and XL-MS also revealed an evolutionary invariant intramolecular interaction within 47 RAD18 between the catalytic RING and the DNA-binding SAP domains that is essential for 48 the ubiquitination of PCNA. Using interaction proteomics, we revealed that another Type-I 49 MAGE, MAGE-C2, interacts with the RING ubiquitin ligase TRIM28 in a similar fashion as 50 the MAGEA4/RAD18 complex. We propose that the peptide-binding groove identified in the 51 C-terminal WH of MAGEA4 exists in other type-I MAGE proteins and serves as a ligase52 binding cleft. Our data reveal crucial insights into RAD18-mediated ubiquitination of PCNA 53 and its regulation by MAGE-A4. 54",

            "text": "Melanoma associated antigen 4 (MAGEA4) is a cancer-testis antigen (CTA) that is primarily 36 expressed in the testes of healthy adults but is aberrantly overexpressed and also a poor 37 prognostic marker in several human cancers. In its cancer-specific role, MAGEA4 interacts 38 with RAD18 and activates trans-lesion DNA synthesis (TLS), potentially favouring tumour 39 evolution. However, the precise mode of interaction between RAD18 and MAGEA4 and its 40 implications on the ubiquitination activity of RAD18 are unknown. Here, we employed NMR 41 and AlphaFold2 (AF) to reveal that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme RAD6-binding domain 42 (R6BD) of RAD18 interacts with a groove in the C-terminal winged-helix subdomain (WH) 43 of MAGEA4. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), we found that MAGEA4 44 displaces RAD6 from the R6BD of RAD18 and inhibits degradative autoubiquitination of 45 RAD18, which could be countered by a competing short peptide of the RAD18 R6B region. 46 AF and XL-MS also revealed an evolutionary invariant intramolecular interaction within 47 RAD18 between the catalytic RING and the DNA-binding SAP domains that is essential for 48 the ubiquitination of PCNA. Using interaction proteomics, we revealed that another Type-I 49 MAGE, MAGE-C2, interacts with the RING ubiquitin ligase TRIM28 in a similar fashion as 50 the MAGEA4/RAD18 complex. We propose that the peptide-binding groove identified in the 51 C-terminal WH of MAGEA4 exists in other type-I MAGE proteins and serves as a ligase-52 binding cleft. Our data reveal crucial insights into RAD18-mediated ubiquitination of PCNA 53 and its regulation by MAGE-A4. 54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\nIntroduction 65\nProtein ubiquitination is a conserved post-translational modification, exclusive to eukaryotes, 66 that regulates numerous cellular processes including protein turnover, cell cycle, DNA repair, 67 intracellular trafficking and innate immunity (1). Ubiquitination is mediated by a three-68 enzyme cascade (E1, E2, E3) that begins with the attachment of ubiquitin (Ub), a 76 amino 69 acid protein, to E1. E1 then transfers Ub to a catalytic cysteine within E2, which subsequently 70 catalyses the formation of an isopeptide bond between Ub and a lysine within the substrate. 71 E3 ensures the specificity of the reaction by binding both E2 and the substrate simultaneously 72 (1). 73\nUbiquitination plays a key role in orchestrating a series of responses to damaged DNA. UV 74 induced DNA damage can lead to bulky lesions, for example cyclobutane pyridimine dimers 75 (2), which cannot be accommodated by replicative polymerases, causing the replication fork 76 to stall and subsequently causing double-stranded breaks, chromosome instability or cell 77 death (3). Therefore, eukaryotes have evolved mechanisms to bypass damaged DNA, termed 78 DNA damage tolerance (DDT). The accumulation of single stranded DNA resulting from 79 replication fork stalling recruits the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD18, in complex with the 80 E2 RAD6 (4,5). RAD18/RAD6 monoubiquitinates the DNA sliding clamp PCNA, inducing a 81 polymerase switching event in which the replicative polymerase is substituted for a member 82 of the Y family of polymerases (Pol\u03b7, Pol\u03ba, Pol\u03b9 and REV1) (6). Y family polymerases are 83 able to facilitate trans-lesion synthesis (TLS) past bulky lesions and allow replication to 84 resume in an error-prone or error-free manner, depending on the polymerase (7). RAD18 and 85 RAD6 are both upregulated following exposure to DNA damaging agents (8). RAD18 levels 86 in the cell are tightly controlled in order to prevent PCNA monoubiquitination and the 87 recruitment of error-prone Y-family polymerases in the absence of DNA damage. This 88 control is mediated by RAD18 autoubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation 89 (9,10). 90\nRAD18 is a 61.1 kDa, multi-domain protein that is conserved from yeast to humans (Figure 91 1A) (5). The N-terminal RING domain (residues 1-99) of RAD18 acts as the catalytic domain 92 and is also responsible for RAD18 dimerization (5,11). Binding to PCNA was mapped to the 93 N-terminus of RAD18, although the exact residues involved, and the region on PCNA to 94 which RAD18 binds, remain unknown (5). The C-terminal RAD6 binding domain (R6BD) 95 (residues 340-395) and the RING domain of RAD18 form non-overlapping interactions with 96 RAD6 (5). Conflicting reports propose that the zinc finger (ZnF) domain (residues 201-225) 97\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The SAP domain 98 (residues 248-282) has been shown to be involved in DNA binding (5).The structures of the 99\nZnF domain, R6BD and RING domain have been reported (1,11,14\u201316). 100\nMelanoma antigens (MAGEs) are a family of ~ 40 proteins in humans, many of which are 101 selectively expressed in germ-line and cancer cells (17). Numerous MAGEs bind RING E3 102 ubiquitin ligases and modulate their activities through an unknown mechanism (18). For 103 example, MAGE-A3/6 binds TRIM28 and promotes ubiquitination of AMPK\u03b11 (19). 104 MAGEA4 was shown to bind and stabilise RAD18 in mammalian cells, even in the absence 105 of UV-induced DNA damage (20). The MAGEA4 interaction surface was mapped to the 106 R6BD of RAD18. Despite high sequence and structural similarity amongst MAGEA proteins, 107 RAD18 binding was found to be highly specific to MAGEA4 (17,20). Normally, MAGEA4 108 expression is confined to the testes (21). Likewise, RAD18 is highly expressed in the testes 109 (22) and is important for the long-term maintenance of spermatogenesis (23), indicating that 110 the MAGEA4/RAD18 interaction may also be relevant during spermatogenesis. Aberrant 111 expression of MAGEA4 in cancer cells may encourage PCNA monoubiquitination and the 112 recruitment of error-prone polymerases, even in the absence of DNA damage, through the 113 stabilisation of RAD18. This could potentially result in mutagenesis and drive cancer 114 progression (20). MAGE proteins have been shown to bind to RING E3 ligases via a 115 conserved MAGE homology domain (MHD) (18,24). Crystal structures of the MAGE 116 homology domains (MHD) of MAGEA4, \u2013A3, -A11 and -G1 have been reported (18,25). 117 However, these structures fail to explain how MAGEs influence RING ligase activity. 118 Structural characterisation of MAGEA4/RAD18 would give general insights into how MAGE 119 proteins interact with, activate and stabilise RING ligases, as well as further elucidating the 120 specific role of MAGEA4 in DDT pathways in germ-line and cancer cells. Furthermore, the 121 MAGEA4/RAD18 interface represents a potential drug target for cancer therapies. 122\nIn this study, we used AlphaFold2 (AF), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 123 and mutagenesis experiments to dissect the interaction between the MAGEA4 MHD and the 124 RAD18 R6BD. We identified a peptide-binding groove in MAGEA4 which specifically binds 125 to RAD18. MAGEA4 also outcompetes RAD6 and displaces it from the R6BD of RAD18. 126 We find that MAGEA4 sterically blocks the degradative autoubiquitination activity of 127 RAD18 and thereby stabilizes it. We also defined an evolutionarily invariant intramolecular 128 interaction between the RING and the SAP domains of RAD18 that together play a critical 129 role in PCNA monoubiquitination. Finally, we show that the peptide-binding groove 130\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Our data provide unique insights into RAD18-driven PCNA 132 monoubiquitination and the regulation of this process by MAGEA4 in cancers. 133\n134\nResults 135\nThe AF model and validation of the MAGEA4/RAD18 R6B domain complex 136\nMAGEA4 is reported to bind to a RAD18 region corresponding to residues 340-395, which 137 harbours the RAD6 binding domain (R6BD) of RAD18 (20) (Figure 1A). To understand the 138 structural basis of this interaction, we used AlphaFold2 (AF) to generate a predicted model of 139 the RAD18 R6BD (residues 340-400) in complex with the MAGEA4-MHD (residues 101-140 311) (Figure 1B). Supporting the accuracy of our AF model of the MAGA4/RAD18 complex, 141 we found that the per residue confidence values (pLDDT scores) of MAGEA4 and RAD18 142 are high (ranging between 70 and 90) at the predicted interface of these molecules (Figure 143 S1). As seen in the crystal structure of the MAGEA4-MHD (25), our model predicts that the 144 MHD adopts two highly ordered winged-helices (WHs), WH-A (\u03b1-helices 1-3) and WH-B (\u03b1-145 helices 4-8), linked by an extended \u03b2-hairpin. Residues 340-366 of the RAD18 R6BD form 146 two short \u03b1-helices which pack against a hydrophobic and negatively charged peptide binding 147 groove lining \u03b14, \u03b15 and \u03b18 in WH-B of MAGEA4 (Figure 1B-C). AF predicts with low 148 confidence that the C-terminus of the RAD18 R6BD (residues 366-400) associates with WH-149 A of MAGEA4, but this is predicted to be disordered in the AF model and does not 150 participate in specific interactions with the MAGEA4-MHD (Figure S1). 151\nThe interface of MAGEA4/RAD18 is composed of mostly hydrophobic interactions (Figure 152 1D). A strong hydrophobic patch is formed by Y361 of RAD18 and M161 (\u03b13), I205 (\u03b14), 153 M212 (\u03b14) and V291 (\u03b18) of MAGEA4. Further hydrophobic interactions exist between 154 F350, V354 and A357 of RAD18 and L288 (\u03b18), V285 (\u03b18) of MAGEA4 (Figure 1D). The 155\ninteraction between MAGEA4 and RAD18 is further stabilized by a salt bridge between R343 156 of RAD18 and D215 (loop \u03b14 - \u03b15) of MAGEA4. We introduced charged residues replacing 157 the hydrophobic residues at the interface of RAD18 and MAGEA4 and subsequently 158 performed in vitro HIS pulldown assays by co-expressing His-tagged full length (FL) 159 wildtype (WT) or mutant RAD18 with untagged FL MAGEA4 WT in E. coli. All of the 160 tested RAD18 mutants (F350D, V354D, A357D and Y361D) displayed significantly reduced 161\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We also generated the MAGEA4 mutants M161D and the triple mutant (M161D, 163 I205D, L288D) to examine the impact of mutating MAGEA4 residues on RAD18 binding. 164 We next performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments in which we compared 165 the binding affinity of a synthesized RAD18 R6BD peptide (residues 340-366) to MAGEA4 166 WT and the mutants. We determined a dissociation constant (KD) of 405 nM between 167 MAGEA4 WT and the RAD18 R6BD peptide (Figure 1F). M161D showed a marked 168 reduction in binding affinity (KD = 1.66 \u03bcM) to the RAD18-R6BD peptide (Figure S2), but 169 failed to fully eliminate binding. The triple mutant of MAGEA4 (M161D, I205D, L288D) 170 completely loses binding to the RAD18 R6BD peptide (Figure 1G), indicating that these 171 hydrophobic residues are important for the RAD18 R6BD-MAGEA4 interaction. 172\nThe crystal structure of MAGE-G1 in complex with the RING ligase NSE1 revealed the 173 presence of a dileucine motif at residues L96 and L97 of MAGE-G1 that is involved in the 174 interaction, as well as partially contributing to the hydrophobic core of the MAGE-G1 MHD 175 (18). Mutating these residues in vitro abolished the ability of MAGE-G1 to enhance NSE1 176 ubiquitination (18). The dileucine motif is conserved throughout the MAGE family, leading to 177 the proposition that the dileucine motif is a general feature utilized by MAGE proteins to bind 178 to partner RING ligases (18). Gao et al mutated the corresponding dileucine motif in 179 MAGEA4 (L121 and L122) to alanine residues and showed that the mutant MAGEA4 was 180 unable to stabilize RAD18 in HEK293T cells (20). However, analysis of our AF model and 181 the crystal structure of MAGEA4 shows that these leucine residues are buried within the 182 hydrophobic core of WH-A (Figure S3A) and could be important for the correct folding of the 183 MAGEA4 MHD. Accordingly, we mutated these residues and expressed the double mutant 184 MAGEA4 L121/122A in E.coli. We found that expression of the MAGEA4 L121/122A 185 mutant was significantly reduced in comparison to MAGEA4 WT, despite both proteins being 186 extracted from the same volume of E. coli culture (2 litres) (Figure S3B-C), indicating that the 187 mutant is less stable than the WT. Furthermore, the MAGEA4 L121/122A mutant eluted in 188 the void volume upon size-exclusion chromatography, indicating that the protein is 189 aggregated (Figure S3C). This suggests that the dileucine motif is important for the correct 190 folding of the MAGEA4 MHD and likely only plays an indirect role in the RAD18 191 interaction. In fact, the crystal structures of MAGEA3, MAGEA11 and MAGEB1 also show 192 that the dileucine motif exists within the hydrophobic core of WH-A, with one of the leucine 193 residues exchanged for isoleucine in MAGEB1 (25,26) (PDB: 6R7T) (Figure S3D), further 194\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Instead, in many MAGE proteins, the conservation of the 196 dileucine motif is likely to be necessary for the correct folding of the MHD. 197\nTo further validate the AF model experimentally, we performed NMR titrations in which we 198 titrated the RAD18 R6BD peptide used in the ITC titration above, into 2H, 13C, 15N labelled 199 MAGEA4-MHD (Figure 1H). We were able to assign ~ 75% of the MAGEA4-MHD (Figure 200 S4). Missing assignments are due to the large size of the MAGEA4-MHD (~ 27 kDa), which 201 causes fast transverse relaxation and therefore signal decrease beyond detection for 25% of 202 residues, despite deuteration of the protein. Furthermore, at pH 7.5, the chemical exchange 203 rates of amide protons in loop regions are not optimal for NMR studies and most missing 204 assignments are therefore in these loop regions. However, we could observe strong chemical 205 shift perturbations (CSPs) in the MAGEA4-MHD upon titration. The CSPs were in the slow 206 exchange regime, indicating strong affinity between MAGEA4 and RAD18 R6BD. This 207 necessitated the assignment of the backbone resonances in the bound state. Strong CSPs were 208 found within \u03b18 (E289, V291, V292, R293, V294) and in the loop between \u03b18 and \u03b19 (V298 209 and I300) of the MAGEA4 MHD upon titration with the RAD18 R6BD peptide (Figure 1H-I, 210 Figure S4). Additionally, MAGEA4 V228 and M229 at the C-terminus of \u03b15 displayed 211 significant CSPs, as did residues within the loop connecting \u03b15 to \u03b16 (G230, V239, Y240 and 212 G241). Although it is not possible to differentiate between CSPs caused by direct interactions 213 and those resulting from allosteric changes, the large CSPs detected in MAGEA4 for \u03b18 and 214 the C-terminus of \u03b15 are consistent with these regions being involved in binding to the 215 RAD18-R6BD, as suggested by the AF model. Furthermore, these findings are in accordance 216 with MAGEA4 WH-B being primarily responsible for binding to the RAD18-R6BD. 217\n218 MAGEA4 alters RAD18/RAD6 complex architecture 219\nThe E3/E2 complex of RAD18/RAD6 was shown, through the use of multiple RAD18 220 deletion constructs and cross-linking mass spectrometry experiments (XL-MS), to adopt an 221 intricate architecture where the catalytic N-terminal RING domain and the C-terminally 222 located R6BD both bind non-exclusively to RAD6 (Figure 1A) (5,27). The superposition of 223 the crystal structure of RAD6/RAD18 R6BD (PDB:2YBF) (15) with the AF model of 224 MAGEA4/RAD18 R6BD reveals that the simultaneous binding of both RAD6 and MAGEA4 225 to the RAD18 R6BD would result in steric clashes between RAD6 and MAGEA4 (Figure 226 2A). Therefore, we postulate that MAGEA4 displaces RAD6 from the RAD18 R6BD, whilst 227\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To test this, we performed ITC 228 experiments between RAD6 and the RAD18 R6BD peptide and obtained a Kd of 25.3 \u00b5M 229 between these two proteins (Figure 2B). This means that MAGEA4 binds to the R6BD of 230 RAD18 (Kd of 405 nM, Figure 1F) with ~60-fold higher affinity than RAD6 does (Figure 1F, 231 Figure 2B). 232\n233 To examine the competition between RAD6 and MAGEA4 for the R6BD of RAD18, we 234 performed direct competition assays in which GST-tagged RAD18 R6BD was immobilized 235 on glutathione beads, followed by loading of RAD6 onto the immobilized RAD18 R6BD. 236 The immobilized GST-RAD18 R6BD/RAD6 was then incubated with a 3x excess of either 237 MAGEA4 WT or MAGEA4 triple mutant and the dissociation of RAD6 was monitored. A 238 notable amount of RAD6 was displaced by MAGEA4 WT, though a large amount of RAD6 239 remained bound to the RAD18 R6BD, indicating that MAGEA4 is unable to fully outcompete 240 RAD6 from the RAD18 R6BD (Figure 2C). As expected, the MAGEA4 triple mutant failed 241 to displace RAD6 from the RAD18 R6BD (Figure 2C). Furthermore, increasing the 242 concentration of MAGEA4 did not lead to full dissociation of RAD6 from the RAD18 R6BD 243 (Figure S5). It is important to note here that RAD6 has two binding sites on RAD18, namely, 244 the RING domain and the R6BD which would result in much stronger avidity of RAD6 245 towards full-length (FL) RAD18. To assess the competition between RAD6 and MAGEA4 246 for FL RAD18, we subjected the purified RAD18/RAD6 complex to glycerol gradient 247 ultracentrifugation to monitor the co-elution of RAD6 with RAD18 in the presence or absence 248 of excess MAGEA4. We found that a small but notable amount of RAD6 dissociated from 249 RAD18 in the presence of MAGEA4, indicating that the RAD18/RAD6 interaction is likely 250 to be weaker in the presence of MAGEA4 due to the partial displacement of RAD6 from the 251 RAD18 R6BD (Figure 2D). Additionally, MAGEA4 co-sediments with the RAD18/RAD6 252 complex at a higher glycerol concentration compared to RAD18/RAD6 alone, consistent with 253 the idea that RAD6 does not dissociate completely from RAD18 in the presence of 254 MAGEA4. This is also consistent with the previous observations that RAD18 is still able to 255 perform RAD6-dependent monoubiquitination of PCNA in the presence of MAGEA4 (20). 256 Our pulldown and density gradient data reveal that at least a fraction of MAGEA4 binds to 257 the same monomer of RAD18 as RAD6, resulting in partial release of RAD6 from the R6BD 258 of RAD18. 259\n260\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

As an internal 265 validation of our XL-MS data, we found that RAD6 is in close proximity to both the RING 266 domain and the R6BD of RAD18, as expected (Figure 2E). Interestingly, we found that a 267 major portion of the cross-links between RAD18 and RAD6 occur in a region N-terminal to 268 the previously defined R6BD (5), this is likely because the R6BD is buried within the 269 interaction interface with RAD6 and is not accessible to the cross-linker. We also detected a 270 number of cross-links between the MAGEA4 MHD and the R6BD of RAD18, in agreement 271 with the AF model of MAGEA4/RAD18 (Figure 1, 2F). Surprisingly, MAGEA4 also cross-272 linked to multiple other regions of RAD18 in addition to the R6BD, particularly to the DNA-273 binding SAP domain and to the C-terminus of the RING domain. It appears that although 274 MAGEA4 primarily interacts with the R6BD of RAD18, there is close proximity (or 275 association) between the MAGEA4 MHD and the RING and SAP domains of RAD18. From 276 our cross-linking data alone, it is not possible to determine whether the RING and SAP 277 domains that are in close proximity to MAGEA4 originate from the same RAD18 monomer 278 to which MAGEA4 is bound, or whether these domains belong to the other monomer. We 279 failed to detect any cross-links between MAGEA4 and RAD6, in agreement with the notion 280 that both RAD6 and MAGEA4 interact with the RAD18 R6BD mutually exclusively (Figure 281 2A). Since the XL-MS data on RAD18/RAD6 alone and MAGEA4 were collected separately 282 in two different experiments, the absolute number of cross-links or the intensity of the cross-283 linked peptides cannot be compared between these two scenarios. However, the pulldown 284 (Figure 2B) and the glycerol gradient experiments (Figure 2C) are consistent with the idea 285 that the avidity between RAD6 and RAD18 is reduced in the presence of MAGEA4. 286\n287 RAD18 reportedly exists as an asymmetric dimer, whereby only one RAD6 protein is capable 288 of binding to dimeric RAD18 (11,28). The stoichiometry of MAGEA4, however, is unknown 289 in the RAD18/RAD6- MAGEA4 complex. Firstly, in support of the reported asymmetry of 290 the RAD18 dimer in RAD18/RAD6, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) on 291 the RAD18/RAD6 complex and measured a sedimentation coefficient of 3.79S for 92% of the 292 sample, non-interactive species analysis indicated an elongated complex at a molecular 293 weight of 131.7 kDa, consistent with two RAD18s and one RAD6 (theoretical Mw = 134.6 294\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

However, we were unable to accurately examine the stoichiometry of the 295 RAD18/RAD6/MAGEA4 complex by AUC, perhaps due to the more dynamic nature of this 296 complex compared to RAD18/RAD6 alone. Therefore, to determine the stoichiometry of the 297 RAD18/RAD6/MAGEA4 complex, we performed Mass Photometry on RAD18/RAD6 and 298 RAD18/RAD6/MAGEA4. We determined a molecular weight of 128 kDa for RAD18/RAD6, 299 which is in line with our AUC experiment and previous findings (Figure 2G) (28). 300 Furthermore, we determined a molecular weight of 171 kDa for RAD18/RAD6/MAGEA4, 301 indicating that the RAD18/RAD6/MAGEA4 complex exists as a tetramer containing two 302 RAD18s, one RAD6 and one MAGEA4 (Figure 2G). However, since MAGEA4 only 303 displaces a small fraction of RAD6 from the RAD18/RAD6 complex (Figure 2C-D), it is 304 unclear whether MAGEA4 directly competes with RAD6 for the same RAD18 R6BD, or 305 whether MAGEA4 binds to the unoccupied R6BD and this results in conformational changes 306 within RAD18 that reduces the affinity between RAD18 and RAD6. Future efforts in 307 experimentally determining the structure of RAD18/RAD6 alone and in complex with 308 MAGEA4 would shed light on this aspect. 309\n310 Intramolecular interaction between the RING and the SAP domains of RAD18 311 In the XL-MS experiment of the RAD18/RAD6 complex, we found notable cross-links 312 between RAD6 and the SAP domain of RAD18 (Figure 2E-F). To assess if these cross-links 313 reflect direct interactions between RAD6 and the SAP domain of RAD18, or mere physical 314 proximity in the complex, we analysed the AF model of FL RAD18 (29,30). The predicted 315 aligned error (PAE) plot of the RAD18 model suggests an inter domain interaction between 316 the RING and the SAP domains of RAD18 (Figure 3A, Figure S8A-B). Consistently, we also 317 detected multiple cross-links between the RING domain and the SAP domain of RAD18 in 318 the XL-MS analysis (Supplementary Table 1-2). In the AF model of RAD18, the central \u03b1-319 helix of the SAP domain packs against the sole \u03b1-helix of the core RING domain (Figure 3B). 320 Importantly, the AF predicted interface of the RAD18 RING and SAP domains is compatible 321 with the RING-RAD6 interface, as deduced from a model created based on the crystal 322 structure of a closely related RING-E2 (PDB:6W9A) structure (Figure S8C). The SAP-RING 323 dimer is also compatible with the previously determined crystal structure (PDB:2Y43) of the 324 dimeric RAD18 RING domain (Figure S8D) (11). We have modelled the RING and SAP 325 domain from the same RAD18 monomer as interacting, however, it is entirely feasible that 326 the RAD18 dimer adopts a conformation in which the RING and SAP domains from different 327 monomers interact. 328\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A 331 hydrophobic interaction network composed of residues A287, M284 of SAP and L48 of the 332 RING domain further strengthens the RING-SAP interaction (Figure 3C). Importantly, 333 multiple sequence alignment of RAD18 revealed conservation of residues involved in the 334 RING-SAP interface and confirmed that this RING-SAP interaction is evolutionarily 335 conserved from yeast to humans (Figure 3D). We generated several mutants of RAD18 336 (R51A, R51E, A287D, R51A_A287D and R51E_A287D) to disrupt the interface between the 337 RING and SAP domains. We purified these mutant RAD18/RAD6 complexes and conducted 338 PCNA monoubiquitination assays (Figure 3E). Strikingly, none of the mutants exhibited any 339 PCNA monoubiquitination activity, while they retained RAD18 autoubiquitination activity to 340 a large extent. RAD18 with a disrupted RING-SAP interface was also defective in the 341 formation of ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF) in irradiated HEK293T cells, indicating 342 that the SAP-RING interaction might also play a role in RAD18 recruitment to damaged 343 DNA sites (Figure 3F-G, Supplementary S6E). Interestingly, PCNA was previously shown to 344 interact with the N-terminus of RAD18, however, binding experiments with individual 345 domains of RAD18 failed to detect any direct interaction with PCNA (5). Considering the 346 SAP-RING interaction reported here, along with the previous studies that implicated the SAP 347 domain in interactions with DNA (5), we propose that the RING and SAP domains cooperate 348 through intramolecular interactions to specifically recognize and engage PCNA loaded onto 349 the DNA for ubiquitination. RAD18 is a key factor contributing to increased resistance to 350 radio/chemotherapy in several cancers (31\u201334), therefore it is of high therapeutic interest to 351 inhibit RAD18 in these scenarios. Inhibiting the interaction of the RING and SAP domains 352 offers a pragmatic approach to silencing RAD18, without affecting the function of RAD6, 353 which plays an important role in transcription (35). 354\n355 MAGEA4 stabilizes RAD18 by inhibiting RAD18 autoubiquitination 356\nMAGEA4 is known to mediate stabilization of RAD18 through inhibiting its ubiquitin-357 dependent proteolysis and promoting trans-lesion synthesis in the adenocarcinoma cell line 358 H1299 (20). RAD18 stability is also regulated through the action of USP7, which cleaves the 359 RAD18-made ubiquitin chains and inhibits the proteasomal degradation of RAD18 (36). To 360 understand the molecular basis of RAD18 regulation through ubiquitination, we performed in 361\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In 362 agreement with the previous reports, we show that the presence of MAGEA4 does not alter 363 the RAD18/RAD6-mediated monoubiquitination of PCNA (Figure 4A) (20). However, 364 RAD18 autoubiquitination was markedly reduced in the presence of MAGEA4 in a 365 concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4A). Although RAD18 forms distinct foci following 366 exposure to UV, MAGEA4 reportedly remains soluble irrespective of UV treatment, 367 indicating that MAGEA4 binds to soluble RAD18 (20). Moreover, ubiquitinated or ubiquitin-368 fused RAD18 remains soluble, even following UV treatment, suggesting that RAD18 369 ubiquitination also likely occurs to soluble RAD18 (37). Accordingly, the addition of single 370 stranded DNA did not impact the ability of MAGEA4 to bind and protect RAD18 from 371 autoubiquitination (Figure S9). 372\nTo test if the reduction in the autoubiquitination of RAD18 is a direct result of MAGEA4 373 binding to RAD18, we conducted in vitro ubiquitination assays using MAGEA4 mutants that 374 are deficient in binding to RAD18 (Figure 1). MAGEA4 M161D retained the ability to block 375 RAD18 autoubiquitination, though to a milder extent compared to MAGEA4 WT, consistent 376 with the reduced binding of this mutant observed through ITC (Figure 4B, Figure S2). 377 However, the addition of the MAGEA4 triple mutant (M161D, I205D, L288D) and the I205D 378 mutant showed RAD18 autoubiquitination levels similar to those in the absence of MAGEA4 379 (Figure 4B), suggesting that the MAGEA4/RAD18 interaction directly inhibits RAD18 380 autoubiquitination. To understand the impact of MAGEA4 on RAD18 stability in the cellular 381 context, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with HA-tagged RAD18 and either GFP-tagged 382 MAGEA4 WT, GFP-tagged MAGEA4 triple mutant or GFP alone and monitored both 383 endogenous RAD18 levels and HA-tagged RAD18 levels (Figure 4C, Figure S10). In 384 agreement with the idea that MAGEA4 protects RAD18 from degradation, we found higher 385 levels of RAD18 in the presence of GFP-MAGEA4 WT in comparison to cells transfected 386 with GFP-alone or the GFP-MAGEA4 triple mutant, which is deficient in RAD18 binding 387 and fails to inhibit RAD18 autoubiquitination in vitro (Figure 4 B-C). 388\nTo understand how MAGEA4 is able to block autoubiquitination of RAD18, we sought to 389 identify the sites of RAD18 autoubiquitination. Towards this, we performed an in vitro 390 ubiquitination assay and subjected the smeared band corresponding to the autoubiquitinated 391 fraction of RAD18 to mass spectrometry analysis (Figure S11). We found that numerous 392 lysine residues are targeted for autoubiquitination along RAD18 (Figure 4D). Previously, sites 393 of autoubiquitination of murine RAD18 were mapped to K161, K261, K309 and K318 (5). 394\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In addition, we also identified multiple ubiquitin chain 396 types in the sample including K48, K63, K11 and K6, indicating that RAD18 397 autoubiquitination is likely degradative in nature (Supplementary Table 3). Intriguingly, 398 polyubiquitination of RAD18 was previously shown to accumulate in cells (GM637 and Mori 399 SV) treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Moreover, upon autoubiquitination in the 400 presence of E1 and RAD6, RAD18 acts as a substrate for the proteasome in vitro (9). 401 Strikingly, overlaying the cross-linking sites of MAGEA4/RAD18 onto the autoubiquitination 402 sites of RAD18 reveals notable overlap, hinting that MAGEA4 sterically disallows the 403 autoubiquitination of RAD18 (Figure 4E) and thereby prevents its degradation in cells. 404\nMAGEA4-induced stabilization of RAD18 has been proposed to cause increased tolerance to 405 DNA damage and replicative stress to drive tumour progression (20). Therefore, it is of 406 interest to disrupt this interaction, especially in combination with the genotoxic stress 407 inducing radio/chemo therapy in cancers that are aberrantly overexpressing MAGEA4 (38\u2013408 40). As proof of principle, we tested if a peptide consisting of the R6BD of RAD18 is able to 409 inhibit the interaction between MAGEA4 and RAD18. We performed in vitro ubiquitination 410 using RAD18/RAD6 and MAGEA4 in the presence of increasing amounts of the R6BD 411 peptide. The R6BD peptide effectively reduces the ability of MAGEA4 to inhibit RAD18 412 autoubiquitination (Figure 4F). Expectedly, the R6BD peptide also inhibits RAD6-driven 413 autoubiquitination of RAD18 (Figure 4F), since the R6BD peptide also binds to RAD6, albeit 414 with lower affinity compared to MAGEA4 (Figure 1F, 2B). Intriguingly, addition of the 415 R6BD peptide did not affect RAD18-mediated monoubiquitination of PCNA (Figure 4G), 416 consistent with the observation that MAGEA4 also does not affect this process in vitro 417 (Figure 4A). Our data suggest that MAGEA4 induces architectural changes in RAD18/RAD6 418 (Figure 2) and inhibits RAD18 degradative autoubiquitination, resulting in higher stability of 419 RAD18 in cells (Figure 4H) (20). 420\nA potential ligase-binding cleft in MAGEs 421 Potts and colleagues have discovered a ubiquitination substrate-binding cleft (SBC) in 422 MAGEA11 which is sandwiched between the two Winged-helix sub domains of the MHD 423 (26). This SBC has been shown to be important for substrate-binding in MAGEA11, 424 MAGEA3 and MAGEF1 proteins. Moreover, the sequence variability in the SBC across 425 MAGEs was proposed to be responsible for the selectivity of different MAGEs towards 426 particular substrates. However, it is not known whether MAGEs use a specific structural 427\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Different MAGEs have been shown to 428 recognize various regions of RING ubiquitin ligases using a mechanism that is not understood 429 (18). The R6BD of RAD18 binds to a distinct peptide-binding groove in WH-B of the 430 MAGEA4 MHD, which is contiguous to the SBC identified in MAGEA11 (Figure 5A). 431 Interestingly, analysis of the crystal structure of MAGEA11 (Figure 5A) and the AlphaFold 432 structures of a number of Type-I MAGEs revealed that the equivalent of the R6BD-binding 433 groove observed in MAGEA4 is occupied with a small helical peptide from the C-terminus of 434 the respective MAGEs (Figure 5B, Figure S12). Based on this, we hypothesized that this 435 region in WH-B has a propensity to interact with short helical peptides. Moreover, analogous 436 to the SBC in MAGEs, we found that the residues lining this peptide-binding groove (PBG) in 437 WH-B are some of the least conserved in the otherwise highly homologous MHDs, 438 suggesting that the PBG could be responsible for the selectivity of MAGEs towards their 439 ligase partners (Figure 5C, Figure S13). We sought to test the role of this peptide-binding 440 groove in another MAGE protein, MAGEC2, the expression of which is a poor prognostic 441 marker in many cancers and which also acts as an oncogene (41,42). MAGEC2 interacts with 442 the ubiquitin ligase Tripartite motif-containing protein 28 (TRIM28), which plays crucial 443 roles in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair (43). MAGEC2, in association with 444 TRIM28, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressors Fructose-1,6-445 biphosphatase (FBP1) and p53 (42,44). We sought to understand how MAGEC2 specifically 446 recognizes TRIM28 as this will provide a strategy to target MAGEC2 in various cancer 447 therapeutics. We superposed the AF model of MAGEC2 with the model of R6BD bound 448 MAGEA4 (Figure 5D). Based on this, we chose to mutate L318 of MAGEC2 which lies in 449 the PBG region. We ectopically expressed GFP-tagged WT and L318D MAGEC2 in 450 HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated GFP-tagged proteins, followed by analysis of their 451 interactomes in a quantitative mass spectrometry experiment (Figure 5E). The mutation of 452 L318 in MAGEC2 resulted in specific loss of binding to the endogenous partner E3 ligase 453 TRIM28, confirming that the PBG in WH-B is involved in binding to the ligase partner in 454 MAGEC2. Interestingly, we also found specific loss of binding to MAGEB2 in the MAGEC2 455 L318D mutant compared to the WT. It is unclear whether there is a direct interaction between 456 MAGEB2 and MAGEC2 or if their interaction is mediated through TRIM28, a shared 457 interaction partner of both these MAGEs (42). Overall, our data indicate that akin to 458 MAGEA4, MAGEC2 interacts with TRIM28 using a PBG in its WH-B subdomain. 459 Importantly, targeting the PBG of MAGEs might provide a viable therapeutic approach in 460 cancers overexpressing these tumor-driving MAGEs (45). 461\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Based on our model, we designed MAGEA4 mutants 466 deficient in RAD18 binding and showed that these mutants are unable to protect RAD18 from 467 autoubiquitination in vitro and fail to stabilize RAD18 in HEK293T cells (Figure 4B, 4C). 468 Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between the autoubiquitination sites of RAD18 469 and the MAGEA4-RAD18 cross-linking sites, indicating that MAGEA4 stabilises RAD18 by 470 sterically blocking these ubiquitination sites and preventing degradative autoubiquitination 471 (Figure 4). Of note, we detected numerous cross-links between the WH-A subdomain of 472 MAGEA4 and RAD18 (Figure 2F), in apparent contradiction to the AF prediction (Figure 473 1B), which implicates only WH-B of MAGEA4 in RAD18 binding. While XL-MS accurately 474 determines the closely associated regions in proteins, it is an indirect technique to unravel the 475 direct interactions. We think the cross links between WH-A and RAD18 are due to the close 476 association of WH-A and WH-B in the MAGEA4 MHD structure and the resulting proximity 477 of WH-A to various regions of RAD18. Additionally, given the dimeric nature of RAD18, we 478 cannot exclude the possibility that the cross-links between WH-A and RAD18 occur with the 479 RAD18 monomer that is not already bound to MAGEA4. NMR experiments conducted 480 between the MHD of MAGEA4 and the R6BD peptide clearly implicate only WH-B of 481 MAGEA4 in RAD18 binding (Figure 1, S4). Moreover, mutagenesis of residues within and in 482 the close vicinity of the PBG in WH-B (Figure 1G) is sufficient to abrogate the interaction 483 between MAGEA4 and RAD18, strongly suggesting that MAGA4-WH-B is mainly 484 implicated in the interaction with RAD18. 485\nIt has been found that full length RAD18 exists as an asymmetric dimer, accommodating only 486 one molecule of RAD6 both in cells and in vitro (11,28). Our Mass Photometry data indicates 487 that the RAD18/RAD6/MAGEA4 complex exists as tetrameric complex consisting of two 488 RAD18s, one RAD6 and one MAGEA4 (Figure 2G). Our XL-MS, competition assay and 489 density gradient centrifugation experiments (Figure 2) strongly suggest that MAGEA4 at least 490 partially displaces RAD6 from the R6BD of RAD18, hinting that MAGEA4 likely binds to 491 the RAD18 monomer that is bound to RAD6, whilst still allowing RAD6 to interact with the 492 RING domain of RAD18. Further studies are required to determine if the R6BD of one of the 493 RAD18 monomers in the dimer is inaccessible to both RAD6 and MAGEA4, or whether 494\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Previous 498 studies using XL-MS and pulldown experiments showed that RAD18 adopts an intricate 499 architecture, where the RING domain and R6BD together interact non-exclusively with 500 RAD6. We propose that the RING and SAP domains together form an interface that interacts 501 with PCNA and consistent with this, we show that interfering with this conserved interface of 502 RING and SAP abrogates PCNA monoubiquitination (Figure 3). RAD18 is one of the critical 503 molecules responsible for the resistance to chemo and radio therapy in various cancers (31\u2013504 34), therefore, targeting the RING-SAP interface provides a unique way to inhibit RAD18 505 and could be employed in combination with the genotoxicity-inducing chemo/radio therapies. 506 Future studies aimed at determining the experimental structures of full-length RAD18 in 507 complex with RAD6, MAGEA4 and/or PCNA/DNA are needed to understand how various 508 domains of RAD18 come together to enable monoubiquitination of the DNA-sliding clamp 509 PCNA at the stalled replication fork. 510\nWe also showed that a peptide based on the R6BD of RAD18 could specifically inhibit 511 MAGEA4-dependent reduction in RAD18 autoubiquitination (Figure 4E). This R6BD peptide 512 naturally also binds to RAD6 and could competitively inhibit the RAD6 interaction with the 513 R6BD of RAD18. Despite this, the peptide did not affect the RAD18/RAD6-mediated 514 monoubiquitination of PCNA, even at the very high concentrations tested (Figure 4F). This 515 indicates that the interaction of RAD6 with the RAD18 R6BD may not be critical to substrate 516 ubiquitination but may only play a role in the autoubiquitination of RAD18. Consistent with 517 this, MAGEA4 addition, which partially displaces RAD6 from the R6BD of RAD18, reduces 518 RAD18 autoubiquitination without impacting PCNA monoubiquitination (Figure 4A). A 519 variant of R6BD-based peptide or peptidomimetic with high affinity to the peptide-binding 520 groove (PBG) of MAGEA4 has the potential to be a therapeutic agent in cancers 521 overexpressing MAGEA4 and RAD18 (31\u201334,38\u201340). Recently, an unbiased screen 522 identified a circular peptide inhibiting the MAGEA4-RAD18 interaction that binds to the 523 same location that we identified as the R6BD peptide-binding groove in MAGEA4 (46). 524\nOur study gives further insights into how MAGE proteins can regulate RING E3 ligases. 525 Unlike other MAGEs, which have been shown to directly alter RING E3 ligase targets or 526 enhance ligase activity (18), MAGEA4 indirectly regulates RAD18 activity by blocking 527\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Given the ability of some MAGE proteins to modify RING 528 E3 ligase substrate specificity, for example MAGEA11, MAGEA3 and MAGEF1 redirect the 529 RING E3 ligases HUWE1, TRIM28 and NSE1 respectfully to novel substrates (19,26,47,48), 530 it is also possible that MAGEA4 could encourage RAD18 to ubiquitinate substrates other than 531 PCNA. 532\nThe stabilisation of RAD18 could promote TLS in the absence of DNA damage, promoting 533 mutagenesis and cancer development. Indeed recruitment of Y-family polymerases has been 534 associated with cancer phenotypes and RAD6 inhibitors are in development as cancer 535 therapeutics (49\u201351). Additionally, MAGEA4 overexpression has been implicated in 536 numerous cancers and MAGEA4 has long been identified as a promising target for T-cell 537 based immunotherapy (52\u201355). RAD18 stabilisation in the cell could have wide ranging 538 consequences since RAD18 has been found to function in the DNA damage response outside 539 of monoubiquitinating PCNA. For instance, RAD18 can form a molecular bridge between 540 pol\u03b7 and the SUMO ligase PIAS1, stimulating pol\u03b7 SUMOylation and enhancing pol\u03b7 541 recruitment to stalled replication forks (56). RAD18 has also been shown to be recruited to 542 damaged chromosomes through its ZnF domain, in a manner dependent on RNF8 mediated 543 ubiquitination of damaged chromosomes (57,58). This recruitment of RAD18 to damaged 544 chromosomes has been shown to promote homologous recombination repair (57). The 545 influence of MAGEA4 on these functions of RAD18 is an interesting avenue for future 546 studies. 547\n548 549 Figure legends 550 551 552\nFigure 1: The RAD18 R6BD binds to the C-terminal WH-B motif of MAGEA4 553 A.

GAPDH was used as a loading control. 667 H. A model depicting (not drawn to scale) the organization of various domains of the 668 RAD18/RAD6 complex in the presence and absence of MAGEA4. Without MAGEA4, 669 RAD6 is bound to both the R6BD and RING domains of RAD18 and in this configuration, 670 RAD18 is prone to degradative auto-ubiquitination, presumably to regulate its cellular levels. 671 MAGEA4 triggers the formation of a tetrameric complex whereby MAGEA4 replaces RAD6 672 at the R6BD of RAD18, whilst the RAD6-RAD18 RING domain interaction is retained. In 673 this configuration, the RAD18/RAD6/MAGEA4 complex is inefficient at autoubiquitination. 674 RAD18 is an asymmetric dimer composed of two RAD18 and one RAD6 molecules. It is 675 unclear whether MAGEA4 binds to the RAD18 monomer that is engaged with RAD6, or 676 whether MAGEA4 interacts with the free RAD18 monomer, indicated by the two models of 677 MAGEA4 binding shown. Various properties of the RAD18/RAD6 complexes are indicated 678 below the cartoons and their respective intensities (+++ or +) are attributed to both the 679 configurations of the complex. Although the model shows the RING and SAP domains from a 680 single monomer of RAD18 interacting, it is also possible that the RING domain of one 681 monomer interacts with the SAP domain of the other monomer. 682 683\nFigure 5: Identification of a potential \u201cLigase-binding cleft\u201d in type-I MAGEs 684 A.

The resulting MAGEA4-MHD-GSGS40-RAD18 R6BD peptide construct was then 1049 used for structural prediction via AlphaFold2 (30). MAGEA4 MHDTo improve the accuracy 1050 of the binding interface, the config.py file was modified to perform a total of 12 iterative 1051 refinement cycles (default parameter: 3), as recommended in Supplementary Methods 1.8 in 1052 (30). Although all five predicted models created in this manner showed near-identical 1053 structures and binding interfaces, the highest-confidence model (as determined by the model 1054 pLDDT score) was chosen to validate the interface biochemically. 1055\nProtein expression and purification 1056\nProteins were expressed in E.coli BL21star by growing the bacteria at 37 \u00b0C in lysogeny 1057 broth (LB), supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic, to an OD600 of 0.6 and inducing 1058 the cells with 0.2 mM IPTG at 18 \u00b0C for 16 hours. RAD18/RAD6, MAGEA4, PCNA and 1059 RAD6 all contain an N-terminal histidine tag (located on RAD18 in the case of 1060 RAD18/RAD6).

Proteins were then subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) 1064 and eluted in 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM TCEP (SEC buffer). 1065\nNMR 1066\nAll samples for NMR were measured in 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM TCEP pH 7.5, 1067 10% D2O (for the deuterium lock) and 0.01% NaN3 at 298 K on Bruker Avance III NMR 1068 spectrometers with magnetic field strengths corresponding to proton Larmor frequencies of 1069 600 MHz, 800 MHz and 1 GHz (all equipped with triple resonance gradient cryogenic probe 1070 heads). 1071\n1072 Experiments for backbone assignments were acquired on MAGEA4-MHD (free or in 1073 complex with RAD18 R6BD peptide in a 1:3 ratio) 2H, 13C, 15N labelled samples. For the 1074 acquisition of all spectra, 3D transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) pulse 1075 sequences with 2H-decoupling (HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, 1076 HN(CA)CO and HN(CO)CACB) (62\u201364) and apodization weighted sampling were used (65). 1077 The resulting spectra were processed using NMRPipe (66) and assigned with the program 1078 Cara (67). Seventy-five percent of all amides were assigned for the free MAGEA4-MHD and 1079 seventy percent for the complex with RAD18 R6BD peptide. Backbone assignments of the 1080 MAGEA4-MHD domain alone and of the complex have been deposited in the Biological 1081 Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) under accession codes 51823 and 51822 respectively. 1082\n1083 For NMR-based interactions studies, the 2H, 13C, 15N labelled free MAGEA4-MHD sample 1084 from backbone assignments was titrated with 3.0 molar equivalents of unlabeled RAD18-1085 R6BD peptide (residues 340-366). A 1H,15N-TROSY-HSQC spectrum was recorded for free 1086 and saturated MAGEA4-MHD. The peptide stock was highly concentrated to keep dilution 1087 effects as small as possible (2.5 mM). For chemical shift perturbation analysis, NMR-FAM 1088 Sparky (68) was used and the chemical shift perturbations (ppm) (CSP) at a ratio of 1:3 were 1089 calculated according to: 1090\n1091 CSP(ppm) = [ (\u0394H)2 + (0.2\u0394N)2]1/2 (69) 1092\n1093\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The ratio of MAGEA4-MHD and RAD18-R6BD at which the former 1095 is saturated were derived from NMR titrations with a 15N labelled MAGEA4-MHD. CSPs 1096 were in the slow exchange, therefore we cannot derive a dissociation constant and backbone 1097 assignments had to also be performed for the complex. 1098\n1099 His-pulldown assays 1100\nWild-type (WT) and mutants of His-tagged RAD18 were co-expressed with untagged 1101 MAGEA4 WT and grown in the same way as for purification, except cells were grown in 50 1102 mL cultures. Following lysis in lysis buffer, each sample was applied to 50 \u00b5L TALON\u00ae 1103 Superflow\u2122 resin and incubated rotating for 1 hour at 4 \u00b0C. Samples were washed 3 times 1104 with lysis buffer and eluted by boiling with 4X laemmLi buffer containing beta-1105 mercaptoethanol, before being loaded onto 4-20% Tris glycine gradient gels (Biorad) for SDS 1106 PAGE, followed by Western blotting. 1107\n1108\nITC experiments 1109\nA 27 amino acid peptide containing amino acids 340-366 of RAD18 was purchased from 1110 GenScript and used at 200 \u00b5M for ITC binding experiments. Full length MAGEA4 WT, 1111 MAGEA4 M161D, MAGEA4 triple (M161D, I205D and L288D) and RAD6 WT were 1112 purified as described in the previous section and concentrated to 20 \u00b5M. The ITC experiments 1113 were performed using a MicroCal ITC200 (Malvern), with a sample volume of 350 \u00b5L and a 1114 ligand volume of 75 \u00b5L. All experiments were performed at 25 \u00b0C and reference power 5. 1115 The initial injection volume was 1 \u00b5L and all subsequent injections were 2.5 \u00b5L at 3 minute 1116 intervals. All experiments were performed in SEC buffer. Data baseline subtraction, analysis 1117 and dissociation constant determination were conducted using Microcal PEAQ-ITC Analysis 1118 Software (Malvern). 1119\nCross-linking 1120\nFull-length RAD18/RAD6 and MAGEA4 were expressed and purified as described 1121 previously. RAD18/RAD6 was incubated with 0.5 X molar BS3 cross-linker to total lysine 1122 residues and the sample was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, shaking.

Samples were then 1125 subjected to Trypsin (70) digest in a 1:50 protease to protein ratio and incubated at 37 \u00b0C 1126 prior to mass spectrometry analysis. 1127\nUbiquitination assays 1128\nFor examining RAD18 autoubiquitination in the presence of MAGEA4, 1 \u00b5M RAD18/RAD6, 1129 0.3 \u00b5M E1, 12 \u00b5M ubiquitin and 2.5 mM ATP were incubated in the presence or absence of 1130 increasing concentrations of MAGEA4, as specified. The assay testing the effect of the 1131 RAD18 R6BD peptide on RAD18 autoubiquitination was conducted in the same way, with 1132 the exception that 5 \u00b5M MAGEA4 was used and increasing RAD18 R6BD peptide 1133 concentrations were added, as indicated. For determining the impact of the RAD18 R6BD 1134 peptide on PCNA ubiquitination, 3 \u00b5M PCNA was added and MAGEA4 was omitted. The 1135 assay involving RAD18 RING and SAP mutants was carried out in the same way but in the 1136 absence of the RAD18 R6BD peptide. . All reactions incubated for 1 hour at 30 \u00b0C. 1137\nAutoubiquitination assay for Mass Spectrometry 1138\n2.5 \u00b5M RAD18/RAD6, 0.75 \u00b5M E1, 30 \u00b5M ubiquitin and 6.25 mM ATP were incubated in 1139 the presence or absence of 12.5 \u00b5M MAGEA4 (WT or mutant, as indicated) for 45 minutes at 1140 30 \u00b0C. RAD18/RAD6 was incubated with MAGEA4 for 1 hour at 4 \u00b0C prior to the reaction. 1141 The reaction was performed in 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT. 1142 Samples were subsequently loaded onto an SDS PAGE gel and analysed by western blot. For 1143 mass spectrometry analysis, the reaction was performed at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour, samples were run 1144 on an SDS PAGE gel. 1145\nIn-Gel digestion 1146\nFollowing SDS-PAGE and coomassie staining, the gel streak corresponding to 1147 autoubiquitinated RAD18 were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (70) to 1148 generate peptides containing the Lys- -Gly-Gly (diGLY) remnant. Peptides were extracted 1149 from the gel by sonication for 15 minutes, followed by centrifugation and supernatant 1150 collection. A solution of 50:50 water: acetonitrile, 1 % formic acid was added for a second 1151 extraction and the samples were again sonicated for 15 minutes, centrifuged and the 1152 supernatant was pooled with the first extract. The supernatants were dried down and 1153 reconstituted in 10 \u00b5L 4% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid in water and analysed by LC-MS/MS. 1154\nMass spectrometry 1155\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Trapping was carried out with a constant flow of trapping solvent (0.05% 1168 trifluoroacetic acid in water) at 30 \u00b5L/min onto the trapping column for 6 minutes. 1169 Subsequently, peptides were eluted and separated on the analytical column using a gradient 1170 composed of Solvent A (3% DMSO, 0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (3% DMSO, 1171 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) with a constant flow of 0.3 \u00b5L/min. For the diGLY analysis 1172 of ubiquitinated RAD18, the percentage of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, 3% 1173 DMSO) was increased from 2% to 8% in 2.2 min, to 23% in 40.9 min, in 5 min from 23% to 1174 38%, followed by an increase of B to 80% in 4 min and a re-equilibration back to 2% B for 6 1175 min.

His-GST-RAD18 R6BD was incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B (Cytiva) 1270 for 2 hours, rotating at 4 \u00b0C. The beads were subsequently washed several times and then 1271 blocked with 5% BSA for 1 hour, rotating at 4 \u00b0C. Following numerous washes, a 3x Molar 1272 excess of RAD6 to RAD18 R6BD was then incubated with the beads for 4 hours, rotating at 4 1273 \u00b0C. Following several washes, the beads were incubated with a 5x Molar excess MAGEA4 to 1274 RAD18 R6BD overnight, rotating at 4 \u00b0C. The beads were gently pelleted in a table top 1275 centrifuge and the supernatant was taken for analysis via SDS PAGE. The beads were then 1276 washed several times and proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 2x laemmli 1277 buffer. Gel samples were boiled for 3 minutes prior to application to the SDS PAGE gel. 1278\nGlycerol gradient experiment 1279\nRAD18/RAD6, RAD18/RAD6/MAGE4, RAD6 or MAGEA4 were added to a 5-20 % 1280 glycerol gradient and the sample was centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 18 hours, before being 1281 fractionated into 200 \u00b5L fractions.

Samples 1283 were run on an SDS PAGE gel and analysed by silver staining using SilverQuestTM Staining 1284 kit (Invitrogen). 1285\nMass photometry 1286\nMass photometry experiments were performed using a OneMP Mass Photometer (Refeyn). 1287 Experiments were performed in SEC buffer. Mass calibrations were conducted with 1288 NativeMarkTM Protein Std (Invitrogen) diluted in SEC buffer in a 1 in 400 dilution. Data was 1289 collected using AcquireMP (Refeyn) and analysis was performed using DiscoverMP 1290 (Refeyn). For the RAD18/RAD6/MAGEA4 complex, the sample was first cross-linked with 1291 BS3 cross-linker, followed by loading on a S200 3.2/300 analytical column to separate out the 1292 cross-linked complex from the uncross-linked proteins. The peak fraction was selected for 1293 MP analysis. 1294\nAnalytical Ultracentrifugation 1295\nThe sedimentation velocity experiment were performed on the RAD18/RAD6 complex using 1296 an analytical ultracentrifuge XLI, at 42,000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, with an Anti-50 rotor (Beckman 1297 Coulter, Brea, USA) and double-seater cells of optical path length 12 mm equipped with 1298 Sapphire windows (Nanolytics, Potsdam, DE). The sample buffer was the same as the SEC 1299 buffer and RAD18/RAD6 was used at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Acquisitions were made 1300 using absorbance at 280 nm and interference optics. Data was processed using Redate v 1.0.0 1301 and analysis was conducted with SEDFIT, v 16.36 and Gussi 1.4.2. 1302\nConfocal imaging 1303\n293T (Human embryonic kidney cells-ATCC CRL-3216) cells were grown on poly-D Lysine 1304 coated coverslips. The cells were transfected with HA RAD18/ HA RAD18(R51E) using PEI 1305 (polyethylenimine). 24 hours after transfection, the cells were washed in PBS and exposed to 1306 UV (10 miliJules/cm2) in a Stratalinker UV crosslinker oven (Stratagene). 4 hours after the 1307 UV irradiation, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% (wt/vol) in PBS) for 15 minutes 1308 at room temperature (RT), followed by permeabilization and blocking in 5% BSA containing 1309 0.3% Triton X 100 and immunostained overnight at 4 \u00b0C with an antibody against HA-Tag. 1310 The next day, cells were washed and further treated with Alexa fluor 555 conjugated anti- 1311 rabbit Secondary Antibody for 1 hour in the dark in a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator. The cells 1312 were then mounted with ProLong antifade mountant with DAPI and imaged with a Leica TCS 1313\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Cells not exposed to UV [HA RAD18/ HA RAD18 R51E (-UV)] 1314 were taken as control and processed as described for the +UV counterparts. 1315\nFor statistical analysis, the total number of transfected cells and the number of transfected 1316 cells with UV-irradiation induced RAD18 foci were counted from 8 different fields for each 1317 condition. The percentage difference of transfected cells with UV-irradiation induced RAD18 1318 foci between HA RAD18 and HA RAD18 R51E was calculated using Graphpad prism 9. 1319 Statistical significance of data was calculated by an unpaired T test and is marked as **** for 1320 p<0.0001. 1321\nWestern Blotting 1322\nSamples were loaded onto 4-20% Tris glycine gradient gels (Biorad) and analysed by western 1323 blot (WB) with RAD18 (NB100-61063, Bio-Techne Ltd), PCNA PC10 (sc-56, SantaCruz), 1324 Ubiquitin P4D1 (sc-8017, SantaCruz), MAGEA 6C1 (sc-20034, SantaCruz), HA-tag (C29F4, 1325 Cell signalling), GFP (sc-9996, SantaCruz), or GAPDH (sc-32233, SantaCruz) antibody in a 1326 solution containing 5% BSA, 0.2% Tween20 and PBS. Following numerous washing steps 1327 with 0.2% Tween20 in PBS, blots were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at 1328 room temperature and visualized by fluorescence. IRDye\u00ae 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG 1329 Secondary Antibody (Li-Cor) was used as the secondary antibody to detect RAD18 and HA-1330 tagged RAD18. IRDye\u00ae 800CW Donkey anti-Mouse IgG Secondary Antibody (Li-Cor) was 1331 used to detect MAGEA4, Ubiquitin, PCNA, GFP and GAPDH. 1332\n1333\n1334\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
