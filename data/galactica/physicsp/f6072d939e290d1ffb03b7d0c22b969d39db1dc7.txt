conclusions FGR rate theory has proven to be extremely useful for calculating electronic energy and charge transfer rates in molecular systems. The considerable recent interest in the ability to modify rates of chemical processes by placing the molecular system inside a photonic cavity therefore calls for a cavity-modified FGR rate theory. In this communication we examined the effect of going from a model that accounts for a single cavity mode in a one-dimensional cavity to a more realistic model that accounts for multiple cavity modes in a two-dimensional cavity. To this end, we extended our recently proposed theoretical framework for estimating cavity-modified equilibrium FGR rate constants1 beyond the single cavity mode case to cases where the molecular system is coupled to multiple cavity modes. Similarly to the single-mode framework in Ref. 1, the FGR rate constant can be calculated from cavity-free inputs in the multi-mode case. Our major finding is that accounting for multiple cavity modes
can enhance the Marcus theory rate constant by several orders of magnitude in comparison to the single-mode case. Furthermore, the additional enhancement is cumulative and cannot be explained by a single dominant mode. Another finding is that the rate is affected by a finite number of cavity modes whose frequency lies below a cutoff frequency. A detailed analysis of the conditions necessary for maximizing this effect and its dependence on the reaction energy and reorganization energy was presented in the case of the Marcus limit of FGR rate theory.
