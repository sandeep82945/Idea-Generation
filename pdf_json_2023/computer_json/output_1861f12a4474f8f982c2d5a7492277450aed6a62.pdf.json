    "abstractText": "In this paper we present experimental results obtained by applying a Model Predictive Control strategy for the control of Depth of Hypnosis in general anesthesia. In particular, the Bispectral Index Scale is employed as the controlled variable and the administration of the hypnotic drug propofol is determined by applying a Generalized Predictive Control algorithm, which considers a process model that is linearized by means of an external predictor. The results of four patients who underwent elective plastic surgeries are analyzed and discussed, showing the feasibility of the approach in a practical context.

INTRODUCTION GENERAL anesthesia consists in achieving a desiredhypnotic and analgesic state of the patient during a surgery through the appropriate administration of drugs. In particular, in Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA), the required Depth-of-Hypnosis (DoH) is generally obtained by means of the hypnotic drug propofol, while the required analgesia is achieved by means of the analgesic drug remifentanil [1]. Feedback control of DoH has attracted the attention of many researchers since sensors to measure the level of hypnosis have become available [2], [3]. In fact, the use of a control system where the anesthesiologist acts only as a supervisor might provide significant advantages in terms of patient\u2019s safety [4], [5]. Indeed, many methodologies for the design of a feedback control system for the DoH have been proposed in the last decades. They usually employ the Bispectral Index Scale (BIS) sensor, which provides a number between 0 and 100 as the process variable, while the control variable is the propofol infusion rate. In this context, the devised control strategies can be mainly divided into two categories: those based on ProportionalIntegral-Derivative (PID) controllers and those based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms. Regarding PIDbased controllers, different tuning methodologies have been devised [6]\u2013[8] and experimental results have proven the ef-\nfectiveness of such a kind of approach in the clinical practice [9]\u2013[11]. However, despite the clear advantage of their simplicity, PID controllers have the drawback of being inherently unable to explicitly handle constraints and to optimize the performance. On the other hand, MPC control is strongly appealing because of its capacity of fully exploiting the possible availability of an accurate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model and to explicitly optimize the operations by taking into account the process constraints. Different MPC methodologies have been proposed in the literature and they usually linearize the Wiener PK/PD process model by inverting the static nonlinearity. In [12] and [13] a Kalman filter is used to estimate the patient state. The approaches proposed in [14]\u2013[17] are based on a hybrid multi-parametric-MPC (mp-MPC) algorithm. Then, the use of the Extended Prediction Self-Adaptive Control (EPSAC) technique has been proposed in [18]. However, despite these efforts, there are only a few papers where experimental results are provided. In particular, in [19] the model considers both a continuous infusion and the the administration of boluses, in [20] an adaptive fuzzy model is employed, and in [21] the EPSAC approach has been applied in a post-operative intensive care context. It appears that there is still the need of providing experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC from a clinical perspective.\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nPawlowski et al.: Experimental Results of an MPC Strategy for Total Intravenous Anesthesia\nRecently, an MPC strategy based on an external predictor has been presented in [22], where the differences with respect to the approaches previously proposed in the literature have also been discussed. The devised control technique exploits a patient model to build the control architecture and design the MPC controller. This model considers the available physical information of the patient like age, weight, height and gender, thus allowing the design of a patient\u2019s individualized predictive control system. The noise compensation and the selection of an appropriate sampling period have then been further addressed in [23]. In this paper we present the first experimental results obtained by using this methodology. The aim is to show that the algorithm can be practically implemented and it is capable to successfully deal with the measurement noise, with a low signal quality index (SQI) of the BIS and with interventions of the anesthesiologist. The paper is organized as follows. The employed MPC algorithm is briefly reviewed in Section 2 for the reader\u2019s convenience. The experimental setup is described in Section 3, while the experimental results are presented and discussed in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.\nII. MPC ALGORITHM The anesthesia process consists of three main phases. In the initial induction phase the BIS value should be driven from its initial value (close to 100 when the patient is awake) to its set-point value 50. This transition should be done as fast as possible (less than 5 minutes) in order to reduce the patient\u2019s discomfort, but an excessive undershoot (below 30) should be avoided to reduce the risk of burst suppression [24], [25]. Then, when the BIS settles in a range between 40 and 60, the maintenance phase starts, where the BIS value should be kept in that range during the whole surgery, despite the presence of noxious stimuli. Finally, in the emergence phase, the administration of drugs is stopped and the patient regains consciousness. The MPC technique proposed in [22], [23] aims to achieve the control requirements by optimizing the propofol administration at each sampling interval, basing on a nominal PK/PD model. The robustness of the system with respect to intraand inter-patient variability and the compensation of the measurement noise are achieved by the presence of suitably tuned low-pass filters. The control scheme is shown in Figure 1. It exploits a threecompartment PK/PD model of the patient, which consists of the series of a linear part P and a static nonlinear part H . The linear part is a fourth-order transfer function that describes the relationship between the propofol infusion rate u and the effect-site concentration Ce:\nP (s) = Ce(s)\nU(s) =\n1\nV1\n(s+ z1)(s+ z2)\n(s+ p1)(s+ p2)(s+ p3) ke0 s+ ke0\n(1) where V1 is the volume of the primary compartment, z1, z2, p1, p2, p3 are parameters that depend on the patient\u2019s characteristics (height, weight, age, gender), and ke0 = 0.456 is the frequency of the drug removal from the effect-site com-\npartment. The nonlinear part that describes the relationship between the effect-site concentration and the BIS value is modelled by means of the Hill function H that gives the BIS value as a function of the effect-site concentration:\nBIS (t) = H(Ce(t)) = E0 \u2212 Emax Ce(t)\n\u03b3\nCe(t)\u03b3 + C \u03b3 e50\n(2)\nwhere E0 is the BIS value when the patient is still awake before the induction, E0 \u2212 Emax is the maximum reachable effect by means of the propofol administration, Ce50 is the concentration that is needed to obtain half of the maximal effect and \u03b3 is the steepness of the curve when Ce(t) = Ce50 . In the control scheme, the blocks P and H are used in the external predictor of the controller to obtain the feedback signal y\u0303 that is used by a standard GPC controller. That signal contains the information about the disturbances occurring on the process and the unavoidable modelling uncertainties (note that, although a nominal model of the linear part can be obtained from the patient demographics, the Hill function parameters are unknown and only average values can be used [26]). As already mentioned, the block with the inverse of the Hill function implies a linearization of the process that allows the use of a standard GPC controller. The filters Fn, Fd and Fr are first-order low-pass filters, whose time constants are, respectively, Tn, Td and Tr. The purpose of Fn is to filter high peaks of the measurement noise, while Fd provides the necessary robustness to the system and Fr provides the second degree-of-freedom (set-point following) to the control architecture. The GPC controller determines, at each sampling time, the infusion rate that minimizes a cost function that considers the sum of the error between the reference and the predicted BIS values (over the prediction horizon) and the future control effort (over the control horizon) weighted by the coefficient \u03bb. In this context, constraints related to the saturation values and maximum slew-rate of the infusion pumps are also taken into account. The tuning of the parameters, namely, the prediction and control horizons N and Nu of the GPC controller, the control effort weighting/scaling parameter \u03bb and the three time constants Tn, Td and Tr, have been obtained by applying a genetic algorithm that minimizes the worst-case integrated absolute error (where the error is the difference between the reference value r and the BIS value y) for a dataset of 13 patients that are representative of a wide population [18]."

They are connected to a PC, where the control algorithm is implemented, through three USB-RS232 converter cables. Given that the BIS values are sent to the controller with a frequency of 1 Hz, the sampling period of the control algorithm has been selected as 1 s, which provides the best performance achievable by the MPC controller [23]."

This value is calculated as the average of the last five samples of the controller output. The anesthesiologist can supervise the behaviour of the controller through a suitably designed graphic user interface (GUI), shown in Figure 2. On the left side of the GUI there is a box dedicated to system initialization, where it is required to insert the patient\u2019s demographic data and the COM ports where the medical devices are connected. Then, there is a box to select the BIS target value (whose default value is 50), a box to insert notes and a box where the status of the connected medical devices is shown by means of red and green indicators. In the central part of the GUI there is a box where it is possible to interact with the control system algorithm. In particular, on the top part there are the buttons to start and stop the control algorithm and to temporarily suspend it. The blue button \u201cSwitch Mode\u201d can be used to switch the control system mode between induction and maintenance. In fact, even if the controller parameters remain the same the both phases, the constraints posed in the optimization problem of the GPC controller change between the induction and the maintenance phases. The selected mode is indicated with a green light. The two \u201cChange\u201d buttons can be used to safely replace an empty drug syringe from the syringe pumps. Additional boluses can be performed by the anesthesiologist, if deemed to be necessary, by pressing the orange \u201cBolus\u201d buttons for the required amount of time. After the button is released, the boluses administration is immediately stopped for safety reasons. The amount of drug that are infused are displayed in real time in two boxes on the right of the \u201cBolus\u201d buttons. The yellow button in the \u201cManual Control\u201d box can be used by the anesthesiologist to switch the system from automatic control to manual control and vice-versa. When manual control is activated a blinking\nyellow light indicates this situation to the user. The propofol and remifentanil infusion rates are decided by the anesthesiologist by means of the two text boxes placed in the \u201cManual Control\u201d box. Manual control is also automatically forced, for safety reasons, when the BIS value is not received by the controller or its SQI falls below the safety threshold of 40. In particular, if one of these conditions happens for more than 5 s (for example, because the BIS sensor is removed from the forehead of the patient, or because the use of an electrocautery device introduces electromagnetic noise that impairs the SQI), an alarm appears in the GUI and manual control is applied. The situation is reversed, that is, closed-loop control is reactivated, when the BIS value with a SQI more than 40 is received again by the controller for more than 5 s. On the right side of the GUI there are plots and indicators that allow the anesthesiologist to easily supervise the system during its functioning. The control software also records on a file patient\u2019s demographic data, controller logs, pumps infusion rates and the patient\u2019s physiological data read from the monitor. These data are then used to evaluate the performance of the control system."

In fact, it can be freely chosen by the anesthesiologist and it can be changed at any time during the experiment.

The individual records of the clinical variables of interest are shown in Figures 3-6. In order to better evaluate the results, some typical performance indexes have been computed. Regarding the induction phase, they are:\n\u2022 Induction time: the time interval from the beginning of the drug administration to the time instant when the BIS drops below 60 and remains in the range [40, 60] for the next 30 seconds. \u2022 Lowest BIS: the smallest BIS value attained within the 60 seconds after the induction time. \u2022 Propofol dose: the administered propofol dose throughout the induction time.\nConversely, regarding the maintenance phase, they are \u2022 BIS 40-60: the percentage of the time interval, with\nrespect to the overall duration of the procedure, when the BIS is in the range from 40 to 60. \u2022 BIS < 40: the percentage of the time interval, with respect to the overall duration of the procedure, when the BIS is below 40. \u2022 MDPE (median performance error): it provides a measure of the bias of the BIS values. It is determined as:\nMDPE = Median{PEj , j = 1, ..., N} (3)\nwhere\nPEj = BIS j(t)\u2212 50\n50 \u00b7 100 j = 1, ..., N, (4)\nBIS is the measured BIS value, j is the sample number and N is the number of PE values. \u2022 MDAPE (median absolute performance error): it provides a measure of the inaccuracy of the control system. It is determined as:\nMDAPE = Median{|PEj |, j = 1, ..., N} (5)\n\u2022 WOBBLE : it provides a measure of the intra-patient variability. It is calculated as:\nWOBBLE = Median|PEj\u2212MDAPE |, j = 1, ..., N (6)\n\u2022 Propofol: it is the propofol average infusion rate during the maintenance phase. \u2022 Remifentanil: it is the remifentanil average infusion rate during the maintenance phase. \u2022 T awakening: it is the time-to-extubation. It is determined as the time interval between the time instant when the drug administration is stopped and the time instant when the laryngeal mask or the endotracheal tube is removed. In other words, it is the time interval taken by the patient to breathe autonomously after the end of the anesthesia.\nThe values of the performance indexes related to the induction phase are shown in Table 3. The controller provided a fast induction of anesthesia. For all the patients anesthesia was induced in less than 2 minutes. This was paid at the cost of a slight undershoot of the BIS, as highlighted from the value of the Lowest BIS. However, it is worth stressing that this undershoot did not cause any clinically relevant consequence on the hemodynamic variables. Indeed, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) remained within clinically recommended ranges. Moreover, the administered propofol dose in induction varies from 1.91 mg/kg to 2.52 mg/kg and they are fully compatible with those of the clinical practice. To better highlight the behavior of the controller in the induction phase the values of BIS and infusion rates during the first 10 minutes are shown in Figure 7-10. It is worth noting that the controller automatically performs an induction bolus of propofol. The values of the performance indexes relative to the maintenance phase are shown in Table 4. The controller was able to keep the BIS inside the recommended range from"

By analyzing the values of BIS < 40 and MDPE , it appears that, when the BIS is not between 40 and 60, it is mainly below 40 rather than over 60. This is appreciable from a clinical point of view as it implies that the risk of intraoperative awareness is reduced. It has to be remarked that this is not obtained by overdosing the patients as indicated by the propofol maintenance dose that is, in each patient, below that normally used in the clinical practice of 6 mg/kg/h. It is worth stressing that the remifentanil maintenance dose is shown in Table 4 but it is not managed by the controller, indeed it is manually regulated by the anesthesiologist. As regards the emergence phase, the awakening times were short for all the patients enrolled and typical of the clinical practice. The automatic control system was able to manage the whole anesthesia procedure and there was no need for the anesthesiologist to apply corrective actions. Only in patient 3 the anesthesiologist performed an additional bolus of propofol around minute 62 as a preventive measure for a particularly painful part of surgery on burned tissues. It is worth noting that the controller performance was not affected by this manual intervention. The hemodynamic variables remained stable for patient 1 and patient 3. In Patient 2 there was a rise of BP around minute 62 in response to painful stimulation. In patient 4 the sharp rise in the value of BP around minute 45 was caused by the administration of ephedrine to treat low BP. In patient 1 an oscillatory behavior of the BIS is observed. However, this did not caused any significant consequences from a clinical point of view. In patient 2 the prolonged undershoot of the BIS that occurred after induction was due to the rejection of a rise in the BIS signal that occurred around minute 3 due to intubation. Then, around minute 62 another rise of the BIS signal due to painful stimulation was promptly rejected by the controller. In patient 3 the BIS remained stable with the exception of a sharp rise around minute 62 due to a particularly painful stimulation. In patient 4 the BIS remained stable throughout the whole surgical procedure although there were issues with the BIS sensor reading. Overall, the SISO MPC controller showed a satisfactory performance and a behavior that is compatible with the clinical practice. It is worth stressing again that, in the design of the SISO MPC controller, the infusion of remifentanil is not taken into account, while in the clinical practice it is always present. Hence, from the controller point of view this is seen as a disturbance. In fact, the oscillatory behavior of the BIS seen in patient 1 and the sharp rises in patient 2 and patient 3 can be due to a not optimal management of the remifentanil that is, indeed, manually regulated. Also the undershoot of the BIS seen in the induction phase can be due to the manual administration of fentanyl that is unknown to the controller.\nV.
