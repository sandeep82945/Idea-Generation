Its thickness depends on the temperature and on the orientation of the ice facets.6 The molecular structure of the QLL dictates the morphology of growing ice crystals, it controls the adsorption of molecules at the air-ice interface, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of the chemical reactions involving these molecules.\nThe thickness, structure and diffusivity of the QLL at pure ice surfaces have been extensively studied by both experiments and computer simulations. There are still substantial discrepancies in the estimate of both the onset temperature of surface melting and the thickness of the QLL, which depend on both the experimental conditions and techniques.6\u201313 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a consistent picture of very few (two or three) molten (bi)layers, corresponding to a thickness of about 1 nm, up to 2 K below the melting point.14\u201318 Simulations suggest bilayerby-bilayer \u201crounded\" melting transitions that correlate with the trends observed in sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra.9,19 Furthermore, MD shows that the underlying crystalline layers induce an ordered template in the QLL structure that persists up to 2 K below the melting temperature. This dynamic ordering marks the major differences between the QLL and bulk water,16,20\u201322 and it affects the solvation properties of the premelting layer.23\nWhereas the studies of pure-water ice surfaces still leave unanswered questions, even more remain about how the molecular and mesoscale structure of the premelting layer changes in the presence of adsorbed species. In natural environments, ice surfaces are exposed to extrinsic species of various kinds, including\na Department of Chemistry, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, 95616. \u2021 E-mail: ddonadio@ucdavis.edu \u2020 Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI) available: [details of any supplementary information available should be included here]. See DOI: 10.1039/cXCP00000x/\nions, inorganic, and organic compounds, which impact the structure of the air-ice interface.24,25 Sodium and chloride are the most abundant ions in seawater and can be found naturally in the atmosphere. Sea salt aerosols deposit on environmental snow and ice, and frozen seawater has a layer of brine at its surface containing a high surface density of Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions. Glancingangle Raman spectroscopy suggested that the surface of seawater ice is markedly different from that of freshwater ice.24 According to these measurements, the liquid brine formed at the air-ice interface of seawater ice provides a chemical environment similar to that of bulk supercooled water, possibly leading to changes in the rates of photolysis reactions.26 However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to such a stark difference between pristine and briny ice surfaces and the details of the surface of seawater ice are still mostly unexplored.\nIn this work, we investigate the effect of adsorbed sodium and chloride ions on the structure of the premelting layer at low-index surfaces of hexagonal ice Ih by means of classical MD simulations. We analyse the molecular structure of the QLL in the presence of Na+ and Cl\u2212 as a function of temperature and surface orientation. We consider the two-bilayer low-index basal (0001) and primary prismatic (101\u03040) surfaces, and we model two naturally occurring Na+/Cl\u2212 surface densities of 0.1 NaCl pair/nm2 and 1 NaCl pair/nm2 The former is similar to the surface density at the surface of snow atop of first-year sea ice, while the latter is similar to the surface density of brine atop of sea ice.27 Our simulations highlight how the ions affect the premelting behaviour compared to pristine ice surfaces. Specifically, the presence of ion pairs at high surface density turns the discrete bilayer-by-bilayer melting, which was observed for pristine ice basal and primary prismatic surfaces, into gradual surface melting. Furthermore, solvated Na+/Cl\u2212 pairs alter the surface roughness and its fluctuations thus impacting ice crystal growth, the adsorption of other molecules and the chemical processes at the briny ice surface."

The need for relatively large models was made clear in former works that address finite\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n14 69\n6v 2\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. ch\nem -p\nh] 1\n8 A\nug 2\n02 2\nsize effects in the characteristic behaviour of premelting transitions.15,17 For these reasons, we perform classical MD simulations using the TIP4P/2005 empirical rigid-molecule point-charge model.28 This model, parameterised on a set of experimental properties of water among which the temperature of maximum density, reproduces qualitatively the phase diagram of molecular ice and water,29,30 and it is among the best in the class of rigid non-polarisable forcefields at reproducing the thermodynamic properties of water and ice.31 However, it is important to note that TIP4P/2005 has a melting point of 249.5 \u00b1 0.1 K32, compared to the experimental value of 273.15 K. To describe the interactions between the water molecules and the Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions, we employ the Madrid-2019 forcefield,33,34 which is a point-charge model based on the method of scaled charges. Its parameters are calibrated using hydration numbers, radial distribution functions, and the density of both aqueous solutions and solid NaCl. This forcefield has been used to study the seawater/ice interface, the physical properties of seawater, and the effect of NaCl segregation in ice grain boundaries.35,36\nMD simulations were carried out using the GROMACS 2020.3 program compiled in double-precision.37,38 The MD equations of motion were integrated with a time step of 1 fs, which guarantees the conservation of total energy in a microcanonical test run with a total energy drift of approximately 5x10\u22125eV/atom per ns.. Long-range electrostatics were computed using the particleparticle particle-mesh Ewald method.39 An orthorhombic ice Ih slab model made of 6144 H2O molecules in a supercell with 3D periodic boundary conditions was used for simulations. The slab models were constructed from bulk ice Ih models, in which proton disorder is generated by a Monte Carlo algorithm that minimises the total dipole of the simulation cell.40,41 Bulk ice was equilibrated in the constant pressure canonical ensemble at a set of temperatures from 190 to 240 K with a stride of 10 K. These wellequilibrated models were then cleaved by introducing a vacuum layer of 100 \u00c5. This thickness of the vacuum layer is sufficient to prevent interactions between the two juxtaposed surfaces through periodic boundary conditions. The slabs were equilibrated for 50 ns in the canonical ensemble, enforced by stochastic velocity rescaling42 with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. The same thermostat was used to perform production runs in the canonical ensemble. For each one of the temperatures considered, we ran production run simulations for 200 ns, and the structural properties reported in the next section (density profiles, surface structure function, and order parameter distributions) are calculated averaging over 2000 frames taken every 1 ps for each trajectory. Uncertainties are computed as the standard deviation over eight 25-ns-long blocks into which each trajectory is split. We have also verified that the differences among the blocks are due to statistical fluctuations rather than a systematic drift, thus proving that our production runs are sufficiently long. Furthermore, we averaged the structural properties over the two surfaces of the slab, after verifying that the computed properties are the same on each of them within the statistical error."

Whereas we have conducted MD simulations with both low and high surface densities of ion pairs, hereafter we mostly focus on the comparison between pristine and briny ice surfaces with a surface density of 1 Na+/Cl\u2212 pair per nm2, i.e. a mass concentration of 47 parts per thousand (ppt) (see, for example, Figure 1). The surface structure of ice with a low surface density of ion pairs (0.1 Na+/Cl\u2212 pair per nm2 or 5 ppt) do not exhibit significant differences from pure ice and the results for this system are reported in the supporting information file (Figures S1, S2, S7, S9, S11).\nUsing the experimental cryoscopic constant of water, the freezing point depression of ice with a surface density of 1 NaCl pair/nm2 of NaCl is 3 K. However, the TIP4P/2005 model slightly overestimates the value of the cryoscopic constant and the system melts at 245 K.32 We verified this prediction simulating the direct melting of ice slabs with sodium chloride ion pairs deposited at their surfaces.43 Hence we consider temperatures up to 240 K, corresponding to -9 K below the melting temperature Tm of pure ice and -5 K below Tm with ions."

            "text": "Figure 2 shows the density profile in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the surface. The air-ice interface is on the left side of the plots. Both the basal and the primary prismatic surfaces consist of hydrogen-bonded bilayers. The density profiles show a double peak for each bilayer: a structural fingerprint, the absence of which provides a signature of disordering. As the temperature increases, the outermost bilayers smear and their density peaks decrease, while the valley separating them from the layers underneath increases. As observed in previous works, the outermost layer of pristine ice is already disordered at the lowest temperature considered (190 K). For example, for pristine ice the basal plane surface layer never exhibits the bilayer fingerprint (Figure 2a). The double peak is preserved in the first prism surface up to 230 K, but the presence of a third low-intensity peak at air-ice interface suggests the partial formation of an adlayer (Figure 2c). In the presence of ions the outermost bilayer of both the basal and\nthe first prismatic surfaces are further smeared, and in the latter case, the bilayer structure and the adlayer-related peak are reduced to shoulders and eventually completely removed at 240 K (Figure 2b,d). The difference in the melting behaviour of the second and third bilayer is even starker. The sudden increase of the valley between the first and the second layer of the basal plane of pristine ice confirms the \"rounded\" bilayer-by-bilayer melting transition identified in previous works.19 Conversely, in the presence of ions, the valley between the first and the second bilayer increases gradually, suggesting a continuous surface melting transition. The density profiles of the basal and the primary prismatic surfaces with ions (Fig. 2b,d) behave very similarly as a function of the temperature, suggesting that the ion pairs attenuate the structural differences between between these two surfaces.\nThe Na+/Cl\u2212 density profiles (Figure 3) shows how ions penetrate in the subsurface layers as the temperature is increased from 220 to 240 K. At all temperatures Cl\u2212 is slightly in excess in the outermost part of the QLL, in accordance with the surface propensity of halides observed in previous experiments and simulations of aqueous solutions.44\u201349. We have verified that our modeling framework produces consistent results with previous studies on the surface propensity of anions in aqueous solutions, even if the Madrid model is non polarisable. The atomic density profiles computed for a slab of aqueous NaCl solution at 248 K exhibit a slight accumulation of Cl near the surface and a depletion of Na in agreement with former MD simulations with polarisable water models (Figure S3).47,49 On ice, the accumulation of negative charge at the surface causes a peak of Na+ mass density in the first subsurface layer. Chloride is then prevalent in the layers underneath at the interface between QLL and crystalline ice. The density of chloride ions in the third bilayer increases gradually as the temperature rises from 220 to 230 K, and at 240 K Cl\u2212 penetrates into the fourth bilayer. This trend is the same regardless of surface orientation. To shed light on the behaviour of ions in the QLL, we computed the charge density profiles and compared\nthem with the particle densities of all four species in the system (O, H, Cl, Na) in Figure S4. The peaks of the density of Cl\u2212 align with the peaks of the density of H which have a positive partial charge, thus partially neutralizing the positive peaks of the charge density profile. Similarly, Na+ tends to compensate the negative charge in correspondence to the peaks of the oxygen density. The overall effect is a rounding of the charge density features, which is also the fingerprint of the onset of disorder."

            "text": "Looking further into the structural changes induced by ion pairs, Figure 4 shows top-down snapshots of the second, third and fourth bilayers of the basal facet at 240 K. Although the QLL is dynamic and diffusive, these representative snapshots allow us to interpret the molecular mechanism of ice premelting. At the highest temperature (240 K), we see that for pristine ice (Fig. 4 top panels) the third and fourth bilayers retain the crystalline structure of hexagonal ice, even though the third bilayer exhibits topological defects.50 The second bilayer is much more disordered but it still features areas with crystalline hexagonal structures. For the systems with 1 NaCl pair/nm2 (Fig. 4 bottom panels), the second bilayer is completely disordered and contains a high surface density of ions \u2013 mostly Na+ \u2013 as also shown by the ion density profiles. The third bilayer is mostly disordered due to the presence of ions, mostly chloride, and, similarly to the second bilayer of pristine ice, it exhibits crystalline patches. The fourth bilayer is mostly crystalline, with defects similar to those observed in the third bilayer of pristine ice. However, it embeds chloride ions that replace water in their crystallographic positions. As chloride is easily embedded into the ice lattice, when the temperature increases Cl\u2212 ions gradually penetrate into the deeper bilayers.51,52 The negative ions cause a reorientation of the hydrogen bonding network around the crystallographic sites where they replace a water molecule. Additionally the preferred embedding of anions at the ice/QLL interfaces engenders a net charge that favours the formation of defects and destabilises the interfacial bilayer.53 Previous work21 found that the first two bilayers of pristine ice are more weakly bound and more susceptible to premelting than those deeper in the ice slab. The snapshots in Figure 4 suggest that the anions embedded in as far as the third and fourth bilayers destabilise the crystalline layer leading to a smoother premelting transition.\nCharacteristic snapshots of both the basal and the primary prismatic surfaces at different temperatures are reported in Figure S5 for the second bilayer of pristine ice and in Figure S6 for third bilayer of ice with 1 NaCl pair/nm2. The comparison between these two sets of figures suggests that there is a close correspondence in the behaviour of the second bilayer of pristine ice to the third bilayer of briny ice across the temperature range explored. In the latter system the inclusion of chloride marks the onset of the premelting transition, but extended disordering occurs only when sodium penetrates in the bilayer. Merging the information from the density profiles and Figures 4, S5, and S6 indicates that the presence of a high surface density of Na+/Cl\u2212 ion pairs not only shifts the melting temperature but it also systematically in-\ncreases the thickness of the QLL by a full bilayer. The structural disordering of subsurface layers corresponds to the incorporation of Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions, with the latter penetrating in the deeper layers earlier than the former.\nThe temperature evolution of the layer-resolved RDFs of the surface and subsurface layers (Figure S7) contributes to support the hypothesis that the basal and primary prismatic surfaces, which have distinct premelting behaviour in freshwater ice, melt in a very similar way in the presence of ions and the premelting transition evolves more gradually as a function of temperature."

The density maps of the primary prismatic facet and of the basal facet at low surface density of ions are presented in Figure S8 and S9 in the SI. For reference, Figure S10 reports the q6 distribution for a water slab at 240 K. The latter is between 0.2 and 0.3 and does not depend on the vicinity to the surface. Figure 5 shows that for pristine ice at 190 K there is a sharp distinction in the q6 values among the layers, which at this temperature remain well separated. The surface layer is disordered but its q6 distribution remains on the right of the liquid range. The subsurface layer presents a broad but mostly crystalline q6 distribution and the bottom two layers can serve as reference for crystalline ice. With high surface density of Na+/Cl\u2212 ion pairs the first and the second bilayer are not clearly distinct and the q6 distribution spans the whole range from the liquid to the ice reference. In particular a substantial part of the second bilayer has q6 values corresponding to the liquid phase. The third bilayer already shows the onset of disordering with a tail in the q6 distribution extending below 0.5.\nAs the temperature is increased to 210 K, the first two layers of pristine ice form a continuous distribution of q6 with a marked dependence on the z-coordinate. The q6 distribution does not change significantly up to 230 K, except for a the shift due to the thermal motion of the water molecules and the onset of dynamic exchange of molecules between the second and the third bilayer. In the system with Na+/Cl\u2212 ion pairs at 200 K and 210 K the first and second bilayers form a single triangular q6 distribution centred at \u223c 0.3 extending to 0.6 for the subsurface layer. At 220 K and above there is a single q6 distribution that encompasses the top three bilayers and strongly depends on the z-coordinate. The\nq6 distribution for the outermost part of the QLL is indistinguishable from liquid water, whereas ordering gradually increases with depth in the subsurface region.\nAt 240 K the q6 of the third bilayer of pristine ice shifts to the left of the ice reference, indicating the onset of disordering. In the system with Na+/Cl\u2212 ion pairs the q6 distribution encompasses also the fourth bilayer, which retains values of the order parameters close to the ice reference. Similar trends can be observed by comparing the primary prismatic facet with and without 1 NaCl pair/nm2 (Figure S6).\nThe q6 maps confirm that the thickness of the QLL increases by about one layer when ion pairs are deposited at high surface density. Remarkably, ions modify the local structure of the QLL weakening the regular template induced by the crystalline subsurface layers, so that the surface has the same distribution of the local order parameter as liquid water. This observation agrees with the conclusions of experiments showing that the premelting layer of seawater ice has the same vibrational properties as liquid brine.24 As the ice template is weaker, the differences in the structure and the premelting behaviour between the basal and the primary prismatic surfaces are also weakened for the deeper subsurface layers and vanish for the outermost layers."

We\ndefine the surface by identifying the oxygen atoms, and sodium and chloride ions at the air/ice interface as those accessible to a spherical probe with a 3.5 \u00c5 radius.60 H(R) in Eq. 1 can be rewritten in terms of the normalised height-height correlation function C(R) = \u3008\u2206h(0)h(R)\u3009/\u3008\u2206h(0)2\u3009 and of the surface roughness \u03c3 = \u221a \u3008\u2206h(0)2\u3009 as:\nH(R)2 = 2\u03c32[1\u2212C(R)]. (2)\nA disordered surface is defined \u201cflat\" when it does not have long-range correlations. In this case, which is common for solid surfaces, C(R) decays exponentially with a characteristic length \u03bb and the surface roughness squared \u03c32 is the large-R limit of H(R)2.61 The surface of a liquid, instead, is \u201crough\" and H(R) diverges as log(R). The logarithmic divergence of the interfacial width at the air/liquid interface of water is due to the presence of capillary waves.62 Previous studies using the TIP4P/ice water model showed that, even in the presence of a premelting layer, the air-ice interface can be considered flat up to few degrees below the melting point, and it undergoes a sequence of phase transitions.15,18 Here we revise these findings with the TIP4P/2005 water model and we address the effect of ions. To classify surface structures and transitions, we use the same nomenclature used in previous works addressing surface roughening and premelting.18,63\nFigure 6 shows H(R)2 at each temperature for the basal and primary prismatic facets with and without Na+Cl\u2212 pairs. The curves show two distinct peaks for R < 7 \u00c5 which are characteristic of the short-range hydrogen bonding environment. At larger R the functions differ from one another with a marked dependence on ions surface density, orientation, and temperature. \u03c3 , \u03bb , and H(R)2 for the two different orientations of pristine ice are rather distinct. For the basal plane (Figure 6a) from 190 to 230 K, H(R)2 reaches its asymptotic roughness very rapidly and the value of \u03c32 remains below 2 \u00c52, indicating that the surface is flat. At temperatures below 210 K the surface exhibits a very short correlation length <1.5 \u00c5. H(R)2 retains periodic fluctuations, which are the\nsignature of both the non-diffusive character of the system and residual hexagonal patterning. Hence, we classify this phase as ordered flat (OF). The periodic features begin to fade for R & 10 \u00c5 starting at 210 K and \u03bb increases to \u223c 3 \u00c5. This indicates a surface phase transition from OF to disordered flat (DOF), which is accompanied by the onset of surface diffusion. At 240 K H(R)2 retains similar characteristics as the lower temperatures but the roughness jumps beyond 2 \u00c5, and \u03bb reaches a value of approximately 4.3 \u00c5, indicating a second structural transition to a high temperature reconstructed flat phase (HTRF).\nConversely, the H(R)2 of the primary prismatic surface (Figure 6c) displays large periodic fluctuations from 190 to 220 K. The convergence toward the asymptotic values is slower, and in two cases (210 and 220 K) the correlation length is comparable or larger than the maximum radius of a sphere that can be enclosed in the simulation cell. The long-range fluctuations indicate that this surface retains the fingerprint of crystalline ordering, although the structure is affected by structural defects that lead to the formation of an adlayer of molecules (see also Figure 2). Hence, we dubbed this surface ordered flat (OR). The roughness parameter \u03c32 is non-monotonic with the temperature. It reaches a maximum at 210 K, drops significantly at 230 K and increases again at 240 K. At 230 K the periodic features of H(R)2 vanish indicating a structural transition to HTRF with \u03bb values of approximately 4.3 \u00c5 and roughness similar to that of the basal plane at 240 K.\nThe sequence of preroughening transitions of pristine ice surfaces is similar to those observed in Ref.18 and correlate with changes in the growth behaviour in the Nakaya diagram, which classifies the shape of ice crystals growing from vapour deposition at different temperatures and humidity (Figure 7).59,64,65 The transition from OF to DOF of the basal surface, at about Tm\u221240 K,\ncorresponds to the change from columnar ice crystals to plates at low vapour pressure. The transition to HTRF for the primary prismatic surface at about Tm\u221225 K corresponds to the preference for plates at any vapour pressure. Finally, the transition to HTRF of the basal surface at Tm\u2212 15 K correlates with the occurrence of columnar crystals.\nH(R)2 for the systems with 1 NaCl pair/nm2 (Figure 6bd) indicates that these surfaces are much rougher than the corresponding pristine ice facets. Additionally, even at the lower temperatures, no features arising from a periodic pattern are present, thus suggesting that solvated Na+/Cl\u2212 ion pairs disrupt long-range order at the air-ice interface. The primary prismatic surface is generally rougher than the basal surface up to 230 K. At 190 K, the basal surface with ions has a similar structure function and correlation length to that of pristine ice in the DOF phase, which occurs at higher temperature. At temperatures between 200 and 230 K, the basal and primary prismatic surfaces with ions have the same features and correlation lengths, and can be classified as HTRF. Above 230 K both surfaces undergo a roughening transition that leads to a logarithmically divergent H(R). The structure function of this phase, named premelted rough, is indistinguishable from that of a liquid water slab at a similar temperature (Figure 8). These results suggests that the surface structure of ice with a high density of NaCl is characterized by the occurrence capillary waves. Whereas previous works suggested that anions pin equilibrium capillary waves at the surface of either water or ice,23,48 we do not observe this effect in our simulations. Figure 8 shows that, in spite of the surface propensity of Cl\u2212, neither the surface of a liquid slab is affected by the dissolved NaCl salt, nor we observe the pinning of capillary waves in the premelting layer.\nAbove 200 K (T \u2212Tm \u223c \u221240 K) the surface roughening transitions occur at the same temperatures for both facets, thus affecting the shape of growing ice crystals. We indeed expect that the presence of ion pairs at typical atmospheric temperatures would level the growth rates of the two low-index surfaces and lead to the formation isotropic crystals."

We find that the addition of ions in low surface density does not change the structural properties of the QLL with respect to freshwater ice. Conversely, high surface density of ion pairs corresponding to seawater ice conditions leads to a significant change in QLL thickness, structure and premelting behaviour. Na+/Cl\u2212 ion pairs disrupt the residual ordering of QLL and increase its thickness by at least one bilayer at all the temperatures considered. Surface premelting becomes more gradual in the presence of ions and the differences in ordering and premelting behaviour between the two surfaces are erased. Close to the melting temperature (T - Tm \u223c \u221210 K) the QLL with ions exhibits the same structural features as a water slab, thus providing the same solvation environment as a liquid surface.24\nThe changes induced by Na+/Cl\u2212 ion pairs at the molecular level lead to major chances in the surface structural transitions\nas a function of temperature, erasing the differences between the two facets. This effect may impact the growth rate and the shape of ice crystals growing from the vapour phase in clouds containing significant amounts of sodium chloride aerosols. The observed changes in surface roughness upon ion adsorption may also impact the light scattering properties of ice and snow. The observation that adsorbed ions increase surface roughness, knowing that rougher surfaces decrease albedo, would explain why sea ice has a lower albedo than freshwater snow.\nIn general terms, the key implication of our study is the crucial\nneed to consider the surface density of Na+/Cl\u2212 present when modelling ice surfaces, given its ability at high surface density to alter the surface structure, thus affecting mechanistic properties such as glacier sliding,66 and chemistry at the ice surface.67\u201369\nConflicts of interest There are no conflicts to declare."
