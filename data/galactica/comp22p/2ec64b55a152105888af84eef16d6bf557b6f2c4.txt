With the whole technical program committee’s effort, in total thirtytwo (32) high-quality papers (including full papers and short papers) are accepted and presented at the conference. Among the thirty-two papers, five poster papers cover four aspects of the energy informatics domain (shown in Table 1). Table 1 Themes of the five abstracts from Energy Informatics.Academy Conference 2022 (EI.A 2022) Theme Paper title Software and applications in energy Design of an intelligent trading platform for flexibility potentials of private households in the lowvoltage grid Design of Data Management Service Platform for Intelligent Electric Vehicle Charging Controller— Multi-charger Model Big data and AI in energy Long Short-Term Memory on Electricity Load Forecasting: Comparison of Feature Scaling Techniques Simulation and modeling in energy Automatic Process Monitoring in a District Heating Substation Utilizing a Contextual Shewhart Chart Energy informatics projects and analysis A probabilistic approach to reliability analysis of district heating networks incorporation censoring: A report of implementation experiences The paper (Title: Design of an intelligent trading platform for flexibility potentials of private households in the low-voltage grid) presents the design of a low-threshold energy market for the intelligent trade of small flexibility potentials between grid operators and private households. The market design and the corresponding trading platform have been developed within the FlexChain project. The platform combines traditional IT infrastructure with blockchain elements to ensure economically balanced trading of the low-price flexibility potentials. The paper (Title: Design of Data Management Service Platform for Intelligent Electric Vehicle Charging Controller—Multi-charger Model) introduces a multi-charger architecture suitable for single-use and Open Access Energy Informatics Page 2 of 25 Energy Inform 2022, 5(Suppl 3):36 shared Electric Vehicle Charging connection points. This multi-charger architecture allows using one or several common charging points by applying a mesh network of intelligent chargers orchestrated by a residential gateway. It can manage the generated data load and enable the data flow between several independent data producers and consumers. The paper (Title: Long Short-Term Memory on Electricity Load Forecasting: Comparison of Feature Scaling Techniques) applies the Long Short-Term Memory machine learning algorithm with historical electricity load data from a residential area in Denmark to predict the current electricity load demand. It was found that the Robust Scaler scored the highest R-squared value between 0.90 and 0.95. The R-squared value of the Power Transformer Scaler was between 0.89 and 0.92, whereas the R-squared value of the MinMax Scaler was 0.85. The paper (Title: Automatic Process Monitoring in a District Heating Substation Utilizing a Contextual Shewhart Chart) presents a datadriven process monitoring methodology called contextual Shewhart chart that is a modified version of the Shewhart chart with a district heating substation data in Denmark. The result shows that the shifts of a process variable’s normal operating range can not be captured by a regular Shewhart chart, but the proposed contextual Shewhart chart by using a contextual variable to vary the acceptable operational ranges based on the identified external factor. The paper (Title: A probabilistic approach to reliability analysis of district heating networks incorporation censoring: A report of implementation experiences) employs a probabilistic proportional hazard modeling approach to district heating pipe reliability analysis. The approach can model the time-dependent survival probability of pipe assets as a function of asset-related and environmental predictors, which have been shown to influence failure probability in previous studies. However, the result shows that the application of this modeling approach in district heating is challenged by several issues pertaining to data.

In this paper, we present the design of a low-threshold energy market for the intelligent trade of small flexibility potentials between grid operators and private households. The market design and the corresponding trading platform have been developed within the FlexChain project. The platform combines traditional IT-infrastructure with blockchain elements to ensure economically balanced trading of the low-price flexibility potentials. As a key element of the trading platform, the blockchain technology provides verification of and trust in trading results. The developed design will be implemented and field-tested in the upcoming project phases and economically evaluated with regard to all stakeholders. In this evaluation, special focus will be placed on the different options of blockchain integration. summary of poster papers in the energy informatics.academy Conference 2022 Zheng Ma1, Anna Vocke2, Shari Alt2, Victoria Schorr2, Dirk Werth2, Pedro Baptista3, Jose Rosado4,6, Filipe Caldeira3,5, Filipe Cardoso3,6, Nur Shakirah Md Salleh7, Wahidah Hashim8, Henrik Søndergaard1, Hamid Reza Shaker1, Lasse Kappel Mortensen1, Christian T.

Continuous data streams are often ingested into big data processing and management systems from external sources. They are either processed incrementally or used to create a persistent dataset and related indexes. In order to keep up with vast amounts of rapidly changing data, stream processing systems must be able to ingest, analyze, and persist data continuously. This work presents an architecture and the corresponding tech stack designed to handle massive time-critical data while performing cleansing and transforming operations, then storing it in a cloud database service. The innumerable options for each entity in the tech stack open new paths to different approaches and bench-marks. This will also help choose the best-tailored cloud provider for the solution’s specific needs.
