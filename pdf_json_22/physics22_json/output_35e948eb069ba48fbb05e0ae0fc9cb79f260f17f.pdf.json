Measuring the force of gravity from micro and nanoscale source masses is an essential first step toward low-energy quantum gravity tests. In addition, measuring gravitational forces where the center-of-mass inter-distance is at the sub-mm scale extends the experimentally achievable parameter space for tests of Yukawa-like corrections to Newtonian gravity and tests for higher dimensions proposed to resolve the hierarchy problem of fundamental forces. Here, we propose an experiment using two optically trapped particles in ultrahigh vacuum conditions where the center of mass inter-distance is on the order of 102nm. In the proposed experiment, the source mass is a rotating Janus nano-particle such that the test mass (sensor) experiences a periodic gravitational potential. Using realistic experimental parameters, a signal-tonoise ratio \u2265 1 is obtained for a Janus particle with radius \u2265 102nm and a mass \u2265 10 fg. The proposed experiment extends the search of Yukawa corrections to gravity at \u2248 10\u22125 times gravity regime at 102nm interaction range, opens the door to low energy tests for quantum gravity, and enables experimental tests of extra-dimensional solutions to the hierarchy problem.\nIntroduction. Optically levitated microscopic particles trapped in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments are mechanical oscillators with exquisite force sensitivity due to their weak coupling to their mechanical and thermal environment[1].Through optical or electronic cooling[2], the center of mass motion of a trapped nanoparticle can be cooled down from room temperature to its groundstate of motion leading to a displacement sensitivity down to \u223c 10\u221214 m\u221a\nHz [3]. This impressive displacement\nsensitivity can be used to measure ultra-weak forces[4].\nUsing levitated nanoparticles was proposed to measure gravitational forces at small length scales to determine corrections to Newtonian gravity [4, 5]. The source mass in the previously proposed experiments remains macroscopic in the order of a kg. On the other hand, measuring gravitational forces from nanoscale source masses is necessary to perform Quantum Cavendish Experiments (QCEs), i.e. experiments that test gravitational effects from quantum states of the source mass [6]. The constraints on realizing QCEs requires microscopic distances between solid-state source and test masses [6]. To date, however, the smallest source mass measured is in the 100 mg range with a center-of-mass inter-distance \u2248 1 mm which was measured through periodic modulation of the interdistance between the source and test masses [7]. On the other hand, the search for gravityrelated new physics, e.g., Yukawa potential corrections [8] and higher-dimensional solutions corrections [9, 10], requires measuring the gravitational force at small distance less than a few microns. However, decreasing distances requires a significant decrease in the source and test mass dimensions which diminishes the signal force\n[8]. For example, the force of gravity scales as R4 for two identical masses of radius R with a negligible surface to surface distance d R.\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n06 97\n0v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 M\nar 2\n02 3\n2 In this work, we propose an experiment to measure the gravitational force from nano/microscale objects using experimentally feasible conditions. A signal-to-noise ratio > 1 for a gravitational force on the order of 10\u221230N is realized through (i) decreasing the noise floor through cooling the test mass to its ground state of motion, (ii) using periodically modulated gravitational force through a rotating Janus particle source mass, and (iii) matching the source mass rotation frequency to the natural frequency of the test mass trapping potential. The functional form of the gravitational force at the nanoscale can be probed using the proposed experiment. Measuring gravitational forces at the nano/micro-scale opens the door for testing quantum gravity theories, as well as corrections to Newtonian gravity. We show that under experimentally achievable conditions, the proposed experiment can extend the search for Yukawa correction\nto gravity to the regime of 10\u22125 times gravity for an interaction range \u03bb \u2265 10\u22121, hence, covering most of the parameter space of theories of Yukawa potential modified gravity and extend current bounds at 0.1 micron by up to 17 orders of magnitude. [5, 8].\nExperiment. The proposed experiment is described in Figure 1. Two particles are optically trapped and levitated under UHV conditions[11]. The source mass is a Janus particle [12] that consists of two materials with significantly different densities, here, gold and silica. The Janus particle is spinning in the trap at a frequency \u03c9j [13]. The test mass is trapped in an optical potential with a natural frequency \u03c90. A metal sheet with thickness \u03b4 \u2248 50 nm is present between the two masses to eliminate the Casimir and electrostatic interactions that may occur at the same frequency channel [14]. Due to the interaction between the test mass and the shield, the trap\u2019s natural frequency is modified to \u03c9mod. As a consequence of the Janus particle\u2019s oscillation, the measured displacement spectral density of the test mass will peak at the spin frequency of the source mass. When the source mass spin frequency is equal to the resonance frequency of the test mass, i.e. \u03c9j = \u03c9mod, the displacement amplitude is amplified and becomes detectable under experimentally achievable conditions. It is worth noting that the shield can be made of superconducting material to eliminate the penetration of multipolar electromagnetic interactions since the field penetration depth of a superconductor is on the order of 10 nm - 100 nm [15]. In addition, stray electromagnetic interactions can be counteracted since electric fields, unlike gravitational fields, can be neutralized [16]. Finally, the lack of convective cooling in UHV environments can lead to excessive heating and melting of the half-metallic Janus particle. To avoid that, the UHV chamber itself can be cooled down to low temperatures to increase the efficiency of radiative cooling (see Appendix for more details). In addition, an all-dielectric Janus particle can be used on the expense of reducing the density contrast and the displacement\n10-12 10-11 10-10\nPressure (mbar)\n101\n100\n10-1\nJ a n u s R\na d iu\ns (7\nm )\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n~xmax(m)\nFIG. 2. Maximum amplitude of oscillations x\u0303max (in meters) reached with different chamber Pressure values (in mbar) and Janus particle radii (in meters). Parameter values used to generate this plot are: v\u0304 = 430 m/s at room temperature, \u03c1g = 19320 kg/m 3 and \u03c1 = 2650 kg/m3. The angular frequency of the Janus particle rotation is \u03c9j = 10 kHz. The radius of the test particle is R = 10\u22127 m, and the distance between the surfaces of the two particles is 10\u22127 m. Thus, the distance between the centers of geometry of both particles is ` = R+Rj + 10 \u22127 m.\nsignal[17, 18].\nModel formulation. We model the gravitational interaction of a test particle of mass m with a Janus particle of mass Mj separated by a distance between centers of geometry `. This distance includes a metal shield of thickness \u03b4 to isolate direct electrostatic and Casimir interactions. Placing the test particle at the origin at a distance d of closest approach to the shield and distance ` to the geometric center of the Janus particle. The Janus particle is composed of a left and right hemispheres with densities \u03c1g and \u03c1s. This makes the center of mass of the Janus particle displaced towards the golden hemisphere. We refer to the distance between the center of mass and the geometric center as xj . As the Janus particle rotates about its z-axis, its center of mass oscillates in the x direction inducing an oscillation in the position of the test particle at x, so that its distance from the test particle is `+ xj cos(\u03c9jt)\u2212 x.\nThe test and Janus particles are placed in optical traps that act like springs with stiffness k and kj . We choose kj sufficiently stiff so as to effectively suppress any translational motion of the Janus particle. The test particle is subject to dipole-dipole, Casimir, and gravitational interactions F sdip, F s c , and F s g with the shield. We refer to all these forces due to the shield as fs. It is also subject to an oscillating gravitational interaction F jg with the Janus particle, which induces oscillation in the position of the test particle.

For the rest of the paper we assume \u03c3th \u03c3q, and leave the \u03c3th \u03c3q to the appendix. The small oscillations regime. In the regime where the displacement of the test particle is small x/d 1, the dipole-dipole, Casimir interactions, and gravity forces between the test particle and metal shield are Taylor expanded in x/d, while the gravitational force between the test and Janus particles is Taylor expanded in xj cos(\u03c9t)\u2212x\n` . The constant terms in these expansions yield a DC shift in the position of the test particle, while the linear terms induce a modification of the test particle\u2019s optical trap stiffness. The ensuing equation for the DC shifted oscillator x\u0303 = x \u2212 FDCm is a forced harmonic oscillator of the form\nx\u0303\u2032\u2032 + \u03b3x\u0303\u2032 + \u03c92modx\u0303 \u2248 xjF\n\u2032j g (0)\nm cos(\u03c9jt) + \u03b7(t), (2)\nwhere the modified frequency \u03c9mod is given by\n\u03c92mod = \u03c9 2 0 \u2212\nF \u2032s dip(0) + F \u2032s c (0) + F \u2032s g (d) + F \u2032j g (0)\nm .

Note that the driving force\ndepends only on the gravitational interaction between the Janus particle and the test particle. Consequently, the steady-state solution could be resonantly amplified to measure the weak effect of gravity.\nThe thermal noise is obtained from the equipartition theorem via 12m\u03c9 2 mod\u3008x\u03032noise\u3009 = 12kBT , which implies\n\u3008x\u03032noise\u3009 = kBT\nm\u03c92mod .

The detectable-Yukawa boundary (\u03bb, \u03b1) as function of Pressure (mbar). The separation distance between the particles is ` \u2212 R \u2212 Rj = 3 \u00d7 10\u22127m. The Janus particles has radius Rj = 3\u00d710\u22126m. The parameters \u03c9j , R, v\u0304, \u03c1, \u03c1g are the same as in Fig. 2\n.\nwhere R and Rj are the radii of the test and Janus particles respectively, Pgas is the gas pressure at room temperature, \u03c1g and \u03c1 are densities of gold and silica respectively, and v\u0304 is the rms velocity of gas particles at room temperature. In deriving Eq. (7), we used xj = 3(\u03c1g\u2212\u03c1) 8(\u03c1g+\u03c1) Rj and the damping value \u03b3 = 16Pgas/(\u03c0v\u0304\u03c1R) found in ref. [19]. This maximum displacement is detectable for a wide range of Janus particle radii and pressures Pgas as seen in Fig. (2). The Newton signal to noise ratio becomes\nSNRN = \u03c05/2Gv\u0304R5/2R4j\u03c1 3/2(\u03c1g \u2212 \u03c1)\n16 \u221a\n3l3Pgask 1/2 B T\n1/2 (8)\nYukawa-Corrections to Newtonian Gravity For shortrange gravitational interactions, corrections to Newtonian gravity are generally parameterized by a Yukawalike potential of the form [20]\nV (r) = \u2212Gm1m2 r\n( 1 + \u03b1e\u2212r/\u03bb ) , (9)\nwhere the masses m1,m2 are at a distance r, \u03bb is the range of the interaction, and \u03b1 is the relative strength the potential. If we define Y\u03b1,\u03bb(`) = ( 1 + `\u03bb + `2 2\u03bb2 ) \u03b1e\u2212`/\u03bb. For this potential, the maximum amplitude of oscillation found in Eq. (4) at \u03c9mod = \u03c9j is given by\nx\u0303max = \u03c02GRR4j v\u0304\u03c1(\u03c1g \u2212 \u03c1)\n32`3Pgas\u03c9j (1 + Y\u03b1,\u03bb(`)) (10)\n\u223c= x\u0303max,N + x\u0303max,Y .

In particular, for pressures near 10\u221214 mbar, we can detect forces that are O(10\u22125) smaller than the force of gravity at an interaction range of 102nm, which presents an improvement of O(1018) on the experimentally excluded Yukawa-strength \u03b1.\nDirect tests of extra-dimensions and the Hierarchy problem To resolve the mass hierarchy problem of the standard model (SM) between the weak scale and gravity, proposals of quantum gravity theories lower the scale of quantum gravity from the Planck scale \u223c 1016TeV to about 1TeV. Models with large extra dimensions, e.g. the Randall-Sundrum (RS) and the ArkaniHamed\u2013Dimopoulous\u2013Dvali (ADD) models [9, 10], induces modification of the gravitational force. The 5D RS model predicts gravitational corrections of the form VRS(r) = GmM r ( 1 + 1r2k2 ) , which yields a maximum mean displacement of x\u0303max = x\u0303max,N (1 + 6/k 2`2) and SNR = SNRN (1 + 6/k 2`2). The maximum detectable k becomes\nk2max = SNRN (6/` 2). (16)\nAt 10\u221212 mbar pressure and Rj = 800 nm, R = 100 nm, and all other parameters as in fig. 4, we can probe distances k\u22121 \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22128m. While the LHC can probe much smaller distances of 10\u221219m or energies of order 13 TeV , its tests of extra-dimensional gravity remain indirect. For example, the LHC searches for increased productions of top-quarks or Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton predicted by the RS model [21\u201323]. Direct tests of gravity at the sub-micron scale can detect extradimensions even if the underlying theory does not predict particles at LHC accessible energy scales.\n5 Conclusions. Levitated nano-particles cooled to their quantum ground state of motion represent one of the largest non-classical systems ever realized. Introducing rotating Janus particles is a new addition to the experimental toolkit of levitation optomechanics as they provide a mechanical system that oscillates at frequencies \u2264 GHz. We showed that the gravitational force of a Janus particle source mass could be measured by optically levitated nanoparticles cooled and trapped in ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In addition to the proposed experiment, rotating Janus particles can be used to probe Casimir forces and even to demonstrate the Dynamic Casimir Effect. Janus particles are programmable mechanical oscillators making them attractive for establishing coherent superpositions of massive objects.\n[1] G. Ranjit, M. Cunningham, K. Casey, and A. A.

The gravitational force between the test and Janus particles is ~Fg = Gmjm\n|\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192rj\u2212r|3 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 rj \u2212 r where ~rj = (` +\nxc cos(\u03c9jt), xc sin(\u03c9jt)) and ~r = (x, y) are the position vectors of the Janus and test particles respectively. Taylor expanding the force to first order in xc cos(\u03c9jt)\u2212x\n` and xc sin(\u03c9jt)\u2212y ` yields two decoupled equations of motion in the x\u0302 and y\u0302 directions representing two driven harmonic oscillators. While solutions to the equations of motion up to first order are accurate up to O(xc/l), O(d/l), and O(x/l), numerical solutions to these equations can obtain solutions whose accuracy is noise limited.\n6 Calculating the thermal average of x\u03032. For the onedimensional harmonic oscillator whose Hamiltonian is\nH = p2 2m + m\u03c92x2 2 + fx cos(\u03c9t). (17)\nThe average over one cycle of H yields H\u0304 which is the classical Hamiltonian H\u0304 = p 2\n2m + m\u03c92x2\n2 . The thermal average of x\u03032 for H\u0304\n\u3008x\u03032\u3009 = \u222b x\u03032e\u2212 \u03b2m\u03c92x\u03032 2 dx\u0303 \u222b e\u2212 \u03b2p2\n2m dp\u222b e\u2212 \u03b2m\u03c92x\u03032 2 dx\u0303 \u222b e\u2212 \u03b2p2 2m dp = kBT m\u03c92 . (18)\nDeriving power spectral density of thermal noise. Letting \u03c7(\u03c9) be the Fourier transform of x\u0303(t) and taking the Fourier Transform of Eq. 2 we find that\n\u03c7(\u03c9) = 1\nm\nF\u0302 (\u03c9) + \u03b7\u0302(\u03c9)\n(\u03c92mod \u2212 \u03c92) + i\u03b3\u03c9 (19)\nwhere F\u0302 (\u03c9) and \u03b7\u0302(\u03c9) are the Fourier transform of F (t) = xjF \u2032 g(0) cos(\u03c9jt) and \u03b7(t) respectively. From this, we can obtain the power spectrum of the noise component\nSx\u0303noisex\u0303noise = S\u03b7\u03b7(\u03c9)|\u03c7(\u03c9)|2 = S\u03b7\u03b7\nm2[(\u03c92mod \u2212 \u03c92)2 + \u03b32\u03c92] .\n(20) Since \u03b7(t) is white noise, S\u03b7\u03b7 is a constant independent of the frequency \u03c9. From the power spectrum, we calculate the variance of the noise in the position (since \u3008x\u0303noise\u3009 = 0) as\n\u3008x\u03032noise\u3009 = S\u03b7\u03b7\n2\u03c0m2 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e\nd\u03c9\n(\u03c92mod \u2212 \u03c92)2 + \u03b32\u03c92 . (21)\nNormalizing the power spectrum To determine the value of the integral in Eq. 21, we close the contour in the upper half-plane with a half-circle at infinity. We find that there are two poles in the upper half-plane at\n\u03c9\u00b1 = i\u03b3 \u00b1\n\u221a 4\u03c92mod \u2212 \u03b32\n2 . (22)\nThe value of the integral in Eq. 21 is the same as the contour integral because the integral over the arc at infinity (|\u03c9| \u2192 \u221e) renders the integrand zero. The contour integral is determined by the residues of the power spectrum of x\u0303noise though\n\u3008x\u03032noise\u3009 = 1\n2\u03c0 \u222e C S\u03b7\u03b7(\u03c9)|\u03c7(\u03c9)|2 d\u03c9\n= i ( Res\u03c9=\u03c9+ Sx\u0303noisex\u0303noise + Res\u03c9=\u03c9\u2212 Sx\u0303noisex\u0303noise ) =\nS\u03b7\u03b7 2m2\u03c92mod\u03b3\n(23)\nwhere the residues are given by\nRes\u03c9=\u03c9\u00b1 Sx\u0303noisex\u0303noise = \u00b1S\u03b7\u03b7 m2\u03b3(\u2212\u03b3 \u221a 4\u03c92mod \u2212 \u03b32 \u00b1 i(4\u03c92mod \u2212 \u03b32)) . From Eq. 5 and Eq. 23, we find that S\u03b7\u03b7 = 2m\u03b3kBT. The resulting power spectrum becomes\nSx\u0303noisex\u0303noise = 2\u03b3kBT\nm[(\u03c92mod \u2212 \u03c92)2 + \u03b32\u03c92] . (24)\nQuantum and classical noises. The eigenenergies of the quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E = h\u0304\u03c9(n + 12 ). In the ground state, energy h\u0304\u03c9 2 is shared between the expected kinetic and potential energies i.e. \u3008V \u3009 = \u3008K\u3009 = h\u0304\u03c94 . The equipartition theorem implies 1 2m\u03c9\n2\u3008x2noise\u3009QM = h\u0304\u03c94 i.e.\u221a \u3008x2noise\u3009QM = \u221a h\u0304\n2m\u03c9 . (25)\nComparing this to the thermal noise \u3008x2noise\u3009Th = \u221a kBT m\u03c92 , we see that thermal noise is bigger than quantum noise in the regime h\u0304\u03c92 kBT . When the two are of the same order of magnitude, the noises add and the SNR diminishes by a factor of \u221a 2. In the opposite limit h\u0304\u03c92 kBT , quantum noise dominates and the SNR is\nSNR = x\u0303max\u221a \u3008x\u03032noise\u3009QM . (26)\nRadiative cooling of trapped nanoparticles. Metallic nanoparticles are routinely trapped under ambient conditions [24]. Heating of the trapped nanoparticles from the trapping laser is commonly observed. However, convective cooling is sufficient to cool the particle down. We assume the trapping laser equally heats a trapped particle under ambient or UHV conditions. The convective heat flux is given by\nQconvective = h(Tparticle \u2212 Tmedium) (27)\nwhere the heat transfer coefficient h \u2248 10Wm\u22122K\u22121 [25, 26]. Under ambient conditions and assuming the trapped particle temperature increases by 50 K as discussed in [24], then Qconvective \u2248 500 Wm\u22122. On the other hand, the total radiated heat flux is given by Stefan-Boltzmann law,\nQradiative = \u03c3(T 4 particle \u2212 T 4medium) (28)\nwhere \u03c3 = 5.62 \u00d7 10\u22128Wm\u22122K\u22124 is Stefan-Boltzmann coefficient. If we cool the vacuum chamber to liquid Nitrogen temperature (\u2248 70K), then Qradiative \u2248 700 Wm\u22122. Consequently, radiative cooling can efficiently cool down trapped metallic nanoparticles."
