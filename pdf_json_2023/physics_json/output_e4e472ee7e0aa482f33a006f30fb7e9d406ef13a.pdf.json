Traditional cancer therapies have many adverse effects and often result in unsatisfactory outcomes. Natural flavones, such as apigenin (APG), have demonstrated excellent antitumoral properties. However, they have a low aqueous solubility. To overcome this drawback, APG can be encapsulated in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). Therefore, we developed dual NLC encapsulating APG (APG-NLC) with a lipid matrix containing rosehip oil, which is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Methods: Optimisation, physicochemical characterisation, biopharmaceutical behaviour, and therapeutic efficacy of this novel nanostructured system were assessed. Results: APG-NLC were optimized obtaining an average particle size below 200 nm, a surface charge of \u221220 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency over 99%. The APG-NLC released APG in a sustained manner, and the results showed that the formulation was stable for more than 10 months. In vitro studies showed that APG-NLC possess significant antiangiogenic activity in ovo and selective antiproliferative activity in several cancer cell lines without exhibiting toxicity in healthy cells. Conclusion: APG-NLC containing rosehip oil were optimised. They exhibit suitable physicochemical parameters, storage stability for more than 10 months, and prolonged APG release. Moreover, APG-NLC were internalised inside tumour cells, showing the capacity to cause cytotoxicity in cancer cells without damaging healthy cells.

In 2020, there were almost 19 million patients, and almost 10 million deaths were attributed to cancer.1,2 Traditional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy have many adverse effects and unsatisfactory treatment outcomes.3,4 Particularly, it has been estimated that over 50% of cancer patients usually receive chemotherapy at some stage of their disease.5 However, most existing cancer therapies simultaneously affect healthy and tumour cells, resulting in significant adverse effects.6\u20138 In addition, these therapies can lead to chemoresistance. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is an unmet medical need.9\u201311\nIn recent years, herbal medicines have gained wide attention owing to their beneficial effects against various diseases such as cancer.12,13 Apigenin (APG) is a plant-derived flavone that possesses interesting properties, particularly potent antitumour activity. It has been reported that APG possesses antitumour activity against different types of cancer by triggering apoptosis, inducing autophagy, modulating the cell cycle, decreasing cell motility, inhibiting cancer cell migration and evasion, and stimulating the immune response.14\u201316 Despite being a highly effective molecule that acts\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 6979\u20136997 6979 \u00a9 2023 Bonilla-Vidal et al.

These nanocarriers can overcome the limitations of conventional treatments by enhancing drug solubility, improving pharmacokinetics, increasing efficacy, and reducing adverse effects. In particular, nanoparticles for cancer therapy constitute a highly interesting alternative because of the possibility of establishing passive targeting, since tumoural cell properties allow them to selectively accumulate in these cells due to their enhanced permeability and retention.19,20 Among several nanocarriers, lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) have gained attention because of their ability to encapsulate both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, employment of biocompatible lipids, prolonged drug release, and easy scale-up.21\u201323\nTo increase the solubility of APG promoting an improvement of its bioavailability, in the present work we developed APG-loaded NLC for the treatment of different types of tumors. Moreover, rosehip oil, a natural compound extracted from the seeds of wild roses, was chosen as the liquid lipid owing to its pharmaceutical properties. Rosehip oil has traditionally been used for dermal applications as a skin regenerator and possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that rosehips contain active compounds with antitumoral activity.24,25 These properties might result in a synergic way between the anticarcinogenic activity of APG and the promising activity of this active liquid lipid.26,27\nA dual formulation of last-generation lipid nanoparticles was developed and optimised for administration of APG and rosehip oil. Physicochemical and morphological characterisation, compound interactions, and in vitro release profiles were studied. Moreover, their antiangiogenic properties and cellular internalisation were evaluated. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity in different tumour cell lines was assesed."

            "text": "The homogenisation parameters in order to produce NLC by high-pressure homogenization were previously optimised using a composite factorial design with three levels and two factors. The independent variables were pressure, number of homogenisation cycles, and primary emulsion time, and the dependent variables were Zav and PDI (Figure 1). The results showed that with an increase in the number of homogenisation cycles up to two and pressures up to 800 bar, it was possible to produce nanocarriers with lower Zav and PDI. However, it was established that the primary emulsion time using Ultraturrax\u00ae did not affect the studied parameters; therefore, the method was set up in three homogenisation cycles at 900 bar with a primary emulsion time of 30 s.\nAn optimised formulation was obtained by means of the DoE approach. The independent variables studied were the amount of APG, the lipid phase (solid lipid and liquid lipid mixture), the percentage of solid lipids in the lipid phase, and the amount of surfactant.\nTable 1 shows the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variables analysed and the values obtained. As can be observed, the Zav of the formulations was 200 nm in most cases, as well as PDI values around 0.2, thus indicating a homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles.40 The developed APG-NLC exhibited a negative surface charge of ZP < \u221220 mV. This negative charge may be due to the ionisation of glyceryl behenate (a fatty acid in Compritol\u00ae 888 ATO).41\nSince the surface charge values are associated with the stability of colloidal dispersions, the developed formulations with values of \u221220 mV were considered the most stable.42 In all cases EE was higher than 95%, thus meaning that APG was completely encapsulated.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the four variables studied had a significant effect on the formulation of NLC. The Zav and PDI of APG-NLC were significantly influenced by the concentration of the lipid phase but followed an opposite trend because more solid lipids increased size (p < 0.05) but decreased NLC PDI (p < 0.01). Moreover, the surface charge was significantly influenced by the surfactant (p < 0.001), and the EE % was significantly influenced by both liquid and solid lipids.\nAs shown in Figure 3, higher concentrations of the lipid phase provided larger APG-NLC but with less size dispersion (Figure 3A and B). According to the surface response, in order to obtain APG-NLC below 200 nm, less than 9 % of lipid\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S429565 DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 6984\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nphase and APG concentrations below 0.2 % should be used. However, to obtain a PDI of less than 0.2, higher concentrations of the lipid phase seem necessary. Moreover, with respect to ZP, a lower surface charge was obtained when a higher concentration of the surfactant was added (Figure 3C). EE was highly influenced by the amount of solid lipids with low EE as the solid lipid content increased (Figure 3D). Considering all the evaluated parameters and the trends, a formulation containing 0.1 % of APG, 7.5 % of total lipids, 65 % of solid lipids, and 3.5 % of surfactant has been optimized to carry out further experiments.\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S429565 DovePress 6985\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

DSC was performed to study the variations in the crystallinity and melting point of the lipid mixtures against APG-NLC. In this sense, the melting temperature (Tm) of the lipid mixture was slightly lower than that of the lipid mixture with APG (69.50 and 70.22\u00b0C, respectively). Moreover, the Tm of the APG-NLC was slightly lower than that of the physical mixture, probably because of its small size and surfactant incorporation.43 Enthalpy values (\u0394H) were similar between the lipid mixture and lipid mixture-APG (\u0394H Lipid mixture = 88.87 Jg\u22121, \u0394H Lipid mixture-APG = 97.79 Jg\u22121). Moreover, \u0394H of APG-NLC was lower being 71.10 Jg\u22121. In addition, APG was also assessed showing a Tm of 365.5\u00b0C and \u0394H = 198.5 Jg\u22121.44\nFTIR analysis was used to study the interactions between APG, surfactant, and the lipid matrix (Figure 4B). The FTIR spectrum of pure APG presented vibrational bands at approximately 3278 cm\u22121, characteristic of the O-H group. Moreover, the C-H group exhibits multiple small peaks at 2800 cm\u22121. Additional peaks at 1650 and 1605 cm\u22121 were observed for the C-O group.45 Furthermore, there was no evidence of new strong bonds formed in the APG-NLC, and APG peaks were not observed, thus confirming APG encapsulation in the lipid matrix.\nThe XRD profiles in Figure 4C show the physical states of the APG, APG-NLC, and their physical mixture. Intense and sharp peaks for APG and the solid mixture of lipids are observed, indicating that these components possess a crystalline structure. Typical signals of APG such as 7.07, 10.09, 11.25, 14.12, 15.03, 15.97, and 18.18\u00b0 (2\u03b8) were found.46 Interestingly, APG peaks were not detected in the APG-NLC, which may indicate that APG was present in a dissolved state in the NLC (molecular dispersion). Additionally, the crystallinity of the structures of all components was studied. The lipid mixture showed three peaks, the smaller one in 19.34\u00b0 (2\u03b8), ie d = 0.46 nm, indicated the most stable form of triacylglycerols, the \u03b2 form, and two pronounced peaks at 21.38\u00b0 (2\u03b8) ie d=0.42 nm and 23.43\u00b0 (2\u03b8) ie d=0.38 nm, indicating the second stable form of triacylglycerols, the \u03b2\u2019 form. In contrast, the APG-NLC profile showed the most intense peak at 19.39\u00b0 (2\u03b8) and 23.62\u00b0 (2\u03b8), indicating good stability of the formulation.44,47,48\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S429565 DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 6986\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

Specifically, BS provides information on destabilisation mechanisms, such as sedimentation, agglomeration, or aggregation, which can be observed when differences greater than 10 % are obtained.49 In this way, BS profiles of APG-NLC were studied at 4, 25, and 37 \u00b0C (Figure 6). The APG-NLC formulation was stable at 4 \u00b0C for a period of 11 months, maintaining constant physicochemical parameters, while at 25 \u00b0C, the stability endured 3 months, and at 37\u00b0C, it was stable for only 15 days.\nMoreover, high temperatures accelerated particle destabilisation by decreasing the ZP. As it can be seen in Table 2, the formulations kept at three different temperatures maintained their physicochemical parameters until the ZP diminished (12 months at 4 \u00b0C, 4 months at 25 \u00b0C and 15 days at 37 \u00b0C). All these phenomena were in accordance with the BS results. As can be observed, at all the temperatures, the BS profile increased, probably because of decrease in ZP, promoting aggregation phenomena that, in the case of 4 \u00b0C, seem to start after 1 year of storage. Additionally, the EE was maintained at all temperatures.

The dissociation constant (Kd) of APG-NLC was higher in both the slow and fast phases than in free APG (0.07 and 0.27 vs 0.02 h), thus indicating a prolonged release.37\nMoreover, the half-life results (t1/2) showed that there was a burst release at the beginning during the fast phase of the formulation, but during the slow phase, it had a sustained release, with a t1/2 value of 160.5 h.50\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S429565 DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 6988\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

The toxicity of these compounds was tested in normal human breast epithelial MCF-10A cells. The results were obtained by assessing cellular viability using MTT (MV4-11) or SRB colorimetric assays. The data for the in vitro anticancer activity are reported in Table 3 and expressed as the IC50 concentration of the compound (in \u03bcg/mL) that inhibited proliferation of the cells by 50% compared to the untreated control cells.\nAs shown in Table 3, APG after 24 h of incubation was active only against leukaemia MV4-11 cells, and the activity was 10 times lower than that observed after 72 h. Both empty and APG-NLC had similar activity after 24 h and 72 h against MV4-11 leukemia cells, whereas in human lung cancer A549 cells, the activity was similar only after 72\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S429565 DovePress 6989\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nh. Probably due to slow APG release, after 24 h, the activity was lower in the case of APG-NLC. Additionally, in breast cancer cells, the effect was more potent after 72 h of incubation.\nMoreover, the IC50 of the APG-NLC was 10\u201327 times lower against cancer cells than that of free APG. According to the results obtained in Table 3, the most sensitive cell lines were leukemia MV4-11 and breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, the comparison of APG-NLC anticancer activity against two different breast cancer models showed that APG-NLC after 24 h and 72 h was more active against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-468 cells (IC50 2.9 \u03bcg/mL and 0.41 \u03bcg/mL) than ER-positive MCF-7 cells (IC50 16.2 \u03bcg/mL and 1.8 \u03bcg/mL). TNBC is usually more aggressive, harder to treat, and more likely to come back (recur) than cancers that are hormone receptor- or HER2positive. APG-NLC also showed selective efficacy against tumour cells compared with normal MCF-10A cells (SI index >1, Table 4). Importantly, this selectivity was not observed for the free APG, because it showed cytotoxicity in both, the healthy and the cancer cell line."

This dye binds to neutral fats and phospholipids. The amount of bound dye is directly proportional to the content of neutral fats in the cells. Leukemia cells MV4-11 were incubated with fluorescently labelled formulation APG-NLC-NR (two concentrations of APG-NLC-NR were studied, 0.335 and 1.675 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). After several time points, cell fluorescence was analysed using flow cytometry, and the results are presented in Figure 9A and B. The obtained results confirm the assumption of the conducted research that NLC formulations are an effective method of delivering biologically active substances inside the cells. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the cells after incubation with APG-NLC-NR was compared with that of the control (unlabelled cells). As shown in Figure 9A, after 5 min of incubation with labelled APG-NLC-NR, significantly higher fluorescence was observed. At all time points, a significantly higher MFI was obtained than that of the control (p < 0.05). Moreover, the accumulation of APG-NLC in the cells was fast and stable, and after 5 min, significant differences against the control were obtained. After 240 min of incubation, the MFI values were maintained.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "In this study, a new formulation was developed loading of APG into a rosehip-based NLC. The fabrication method selected was hot high-pressure homogenization, due to its multiple advantages such as its ability of large-scale production, the avoidance of organic solvents, and its low cost.51 Due to the high energy input, it allows to prepare small uniform particles, which is suitable for nanoparticulate formulations.52\nTo optimise the formulation, a design of experiments was applied. Using these studies, a full factorial design was developed, and the analysis showed that all parameters induced statistically significant differences in Zav, in which the concentration of the lipid phase had the greatest influence, followed by the concentration of APG. These results are in accordance with those obtained by other authors, in which increased drug and lipid amounts led to larger nanoparticles.53\nFurthermore, the lipid phase significantly influenced the PDI, showing high values when the lipid phase decreased. Otherwise, ZP was mainly affected by the concentration of the non-ionic surfactant Tween\u00ae 80, which became more neutral with increasing surfactant amounts. This trend may be related to the absorption of the surfactant onto the NLC surface.54 Furthermore, APG encapsulation was high in all the assessments (>95%), probably because of the lipophilic character of APG which had more affinity for the lipid-based internal structure of the NLC.55,56 Other authors encapsulated APG into different NLC matrix by using a hot homogenizer method along with ultrasonication, obtaining smaller nanoparticles, but less stable due to its ZP closer to 0 mV.57 Other research group prepared SLN encapsulating APG by the melt emulsification and ultra-sonication method, in which they obtained small particles around 100 nm, but with a higher PDI.58 Moreover, Liang and colleagues also prepared NLC but encapsulating a similar molecule, quercetin, another natural flavone. In their study, they used a low energy method for the preparation of the NLC, the emulsifying technique, leading to a polydisperse formulation (PDI > 0.3).59\nInteraction studies showed that the lipid matrix of the formulation became more amorphous in the presence of APG, indicating that APG was solubilised in lipids.60 FTIR studies confirmed that no covalent bonds were formed between the drug and the lipid matrix, so hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces could be the main forces between them, facilitating the accommodation of APG inside the NLC and promoting its liberation from the particle.61 Furthermore, the XRD results suggested that APG-NLC could possess good and long stability due to the presence of the most stable forms of triacylglycerols, the \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2019 forms.44,47,48 These results are in agreement with the stability studies, in which the formulation was stable at 4\u00b0C for 12 months. Subsequently, the electrostatic forces between the APG-NLC may begin to decrease, leading to aggregation and sedimentation (as observed in the backscattering profile).62 Despite this, in some cases, sedimentation can be reversed by agitation, and in order to obtain stability for more than 12 months, APG-NLC\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S429565 DovePress 6991\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\ncan be freeze-dried.63 Moreover, interaction studies showed that APG was encapsulated into the NLCdue to the absence of signals of APG in the different studied techniques.\nIn addition, the APG-NLC showed a sustained in vitro release profile, whereas the APG solution was released rapidly. The fitted model for APG-NLC was a two-phase association, due to the formulation being able to provide a first fast release, followed by a slow and prolonged liberation of APG to the medium. This kind of model explains many chemical and biological processes, which could indicate a more complicated binding kinetics mechanism.64\u201366 It was observed that the release of the APG from the NLC reached approximately 30%, showing an initial burst release of APG in the early phase, followed by a delayed release of APG (up to 24 h). Compared to other studies, these NLC showed a slower release, which might be related to the high solubility of APG in the lipid matrix.67\u201369\nIn in ovo angiogenesis studies, the anti-angiogenic activity of the APG-NLC was confirmed. It is well known that APG exhibits antiangiogenic activity, which is related to its antitumoral properties.70 The controls of this study were the negative control (NaCl) and a positive growth control (bFGF), which is known to activate angiogenesis. Although bFGF is one of the most effective inducers of angiogenesis, it frequently contributes to pathological angiogenesis by stimulating vascular endothelial mitogenesis and has been frequently used as an angiogenic polypeptide.71 In this study, a solution of APG at the same concentration as APG-NLC was used (1 mg/mL). The results showed that APG slightly decreased the number of microvessels in CAM. Other authors have reported that at higher concentrations than those assessed (from 1.35 to 5.4 mg/mL), APG was able to suppress normal angiogenesis in chick embryo.72 In contrast, APG-NLC significantly decreased vascular density in the negative and positive controls. These results indicate that the encapsulation of APG into lipid nanoparticles increases the bioavailability and bioactivity of the flavonoid.73 Since APG is an inhibitor of several growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bFGF74 and empty NLC do not exert any angiogenesis modulation effect, the developed NLC were able to enhance APG penetration, thus enhancing APG antiangiogenic activity.75\u201377 Moreover, since angiogenesis provides an expanding tumour with oxygen and nutrients, which are necessary for tumour growth, inhibition of angiogenesis could provide an effective tool for anticancer therapy.78\nThe antiproliferative activity of APG, empty NLC, and APG-NLC towards five different cell lines was evaluated after 24 and 72 h. For the leukaemia cell line (MV4-11), a solution of APG showed greater activity at 72 h than at 24 h. It has been described that APG stimulates signalling pathways that result in cell proliferation inhibition and cell-cycle arrest in fast-cycling cell. Moreover, other authors have confirmed that by increasing the incubation time of APG with leukaemia cells, cytotoxicity increased.79 APG-NLC showed 20 times more activity than free APG at 24 and 72 h of exposure. This was probably due to the ability of NLC to penetrate into the cells, increasing the amount of drug intracellularly.80 This was confirmed by flow cytometry, which showed high and fast NLC internalisation. Moreover, in the lung cancer cell line (A549), APG was not active at 24 h, but its activity increased at 72 h. Conversely, APG-NLC showed a greater effect against this cell line, with the highest effect observed at 72 h. The worst prognosis for survival and most treatment-related issues are associated with TNBC, which accounts for 10% to 22% of all cases of breast cancer that are diagnosed. Furthermore, the absence of response to conventional hormonal therapy or therapies directed at specific receptors makes treatment difficult.81 In order to evaluate the potential of APG in aggressive cancer, the cell line MDA-MB-468 was used. In the first 24 h, the flavonoid solution was not cytotoxic, as reported.82 At 72 h, it showed higher activity, which could be related to its mechanism of action, targeting different signal transduction pathways.83 Nevertheless, APG-NLC showed great cytotoxicity against the TNBC cell line after 24 and 72 h. Another breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) showed cytotoxicity similar to that of APG. Other studies have reported that APG inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent relationship.84 Similarly, APG-NLC were more cytotoxic than APG, and their activity increased at 72 h, probably because of the sustained release of APG from the formulation. To confirm the safety and selectivity of the tested compounds, the cytotoxicity of the formulations was tested against a non-tumourigenic cell line (MCF-10A), and the SI was calculated. The SI is an important parameter for the development of novel formulations. A low selectivity of compounds means that patients are unable to receive the drug doses necessary to eradicate all cancer cells, because doing so would be fatal and eradicate all other body cells.85 The results showed that APG was not selective for cancer lines, except for leukaemia cells, whereas APG-NLC were selective for all tumour cells.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S429565 DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 6992\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nIn contrast, empty NLC showed similar antiproliferative activity against all tumour cell lines and high selectivity, demonstrating excellent safety and efficacy. Since two of the three ingredients of the empty formulation had described pharmacological interest, this led to the potent antitumour effects of the empty NLC. On the one hand, the non-ionic surfactant Tween 80\u00ae can effectively inhibit P-gp and plays an important role in mediating the opening of tight junctions, which could enhance the paracellular uptake of NLC, increasing their permeability.86,87 On the other hand, besides the traditional medicinal of rosehip oil when applied on the skin, in the last few year researchers have been reporting novel pharmacological features. Rosehip oil is made from the seed of Rosa canina sp. and is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and phytosterols such as \u03b2-sitosterol.88 Recently, some authors assessed the extract of rosehip against different cancer cell lines, including colon, lung, prostate, cervix, liver, brain, and breast, suggesting its potential role in chemotherapy.25,89 After treating these cancer cell lines with whole rose hip extract or purified fractions of its most important components, all studies have reported a noticeable decline in cell viability. These antioxidant properties may be responsible for their antiproliferative effect.25 However, its activity may not only be due to its antioxidant properties but is also capable of preventing cell proliferation.90 In another study, researchers tested the rosehip extract against TNBC, and the results showed that it was able to decrease cell migration and inhibit cell growth by reducing two enzymes (MAPK and Akt). In addition, in combination with commonly used chemotherapy, it was able to reduce cell proliferation and migration in tissue cultures, suggesting that rosehip extract might be a useful addition to the thorough treatment regime for patients with TNBC.91 These results revealed that the proposed combination of APG loading of NLC containing rosehip oil could be a promising platform for the treatment of several cancers.\nThe cellular uptake of APG-NLC was studied by encapsulating the fluorescent dye NR using flow cytometry. The selected cell line was leukaemic owing to its high cytotoxic activity. APG-NLC-NR showed rapid uptake in the first 5 min, and the fluorescence intensity remained stable for all experiments (4 h). These results could explain the high activity against these cells, in which NLC were able to penetrate and remain inside. Some researchers concede that NLC represent a good delivery system owing to their composition. As liquid lipids give NLC a less ordered lipid matrix, drugs may be more effectively accommodated; in this case, the fluorescent die NR prevents premature drug release and fluorescence signal loss. The incorporation of liquid lipids promotes higher cellular uptake and permeability across the cellular membrane.92,93"

            "text": "APG was successfully encapsulated into NLC containing rosehip oil with a particle size below 200 nm, a monodisperse population, and high entrapment efficiency. The APG-NLC showed suitable stability for almost one year, as well as prolonged release. In ovo and in vitro assays in tumour cells confirmed that APG increased its activity when encapsulated in NLC. APG-NLC decreased the formation of new blood vessels, highlighting their antiangiogenic activity. Moreover, the antiproliferative assays confirmed APG-NLC selectivity against tumour cells and cytotoxicity in leukaemia, lung, and breast cancer cells. In addition, empty NLC did not show significant antiangiogenic properties, but in vitro antitumoral assessments showed selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells, probably owing to the pharmaceutical properties of rosehip oil.\nThese findings constitute a first approach for this type of nanoparticles including two natural active ingredients, such as APG and rosehip oil, in which both the encapsulated compound and the matrix contribute to the pharmacological effect, acting in a synergic way. This kind of formulation could establish a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer.\nIn conclusion, APG-NLC have been successfully developed and physicochemically characterised, showing prolonged release, antiangiogenic properties, and suitable activity against tumour cell lines."
