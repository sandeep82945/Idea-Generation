For example, the virtual nature, vulnerability, and\nuncertainty of online communication lead to reduced online trust, causing interaction\nanxiety (IA). The data footprints left on the Internet are processed by malicious elements\nfor big data, leading to the leakage of personal privacy data, bringing content sharing\nanxiety (SAC) and privacy concern anxiety (PAC), which are all typical forms of online\nsocial anxiety. In the face of this situation, analyzing the influence of online social\nnetworking on the social psychology of university students and guiding it has become\nan inevitable issue in the Internet era.\nMethods: Learning from the classification of family environment, a self-administered\nfamily process factor questionnaire and the Social Anxiety Scale for Social Media Users\n(SAS-SMU) were used to investigate the online social anxiety of Guangxi University\nstudents. The study used SPSS26.0 and Stata for data analysis and descriptive statistics,\nANOVA, t-test, and linear regression analysis were used to explore the relationship\nbetween family process factors and online social anxiety of the university students.\nResults: The results showed that except for parental supervision (p > 0.05), the effects\nof interparental relationship, parent-child relationship, sibling relationship, and family\natmosphere on university students\u2019 online social anxiety were statistically significant and\nshowed positive correlations (F/t = 6.64, 3.53, 4.15, 5.94; p < 0.05). Multiple linear\nregression analysis showed that university students\u2019 total online social anxiety score =\n36.914\u22124.09 \u00d7 good parental relationship\u22124.16 \u00d7 good family atmosphere\u22123.42 \u00d7\ngood sibling relationship.\nConclusions: Based on the family systems theory, it is suggested that a comprehensive\nintervention should be conducted for the coupled system (parental relationship) and\nsibling system (non-only child\u2019s sibling relationship) in the family and focus on the\nprotective factors of parental harmony, sibling relationship harmony, and relaxed family\natmosphere. In the specific implementation method, the collaborative shared healthcare\nplan (CSHCP) can be used to strengthen remote family emotional interaction and avoid\nInternet addiction. For university students with online social anxiety disorders, their\npersonal health records (PHRs) can be maintained permanently and safely using the Star\nFile System (IPFS), in addition to the convenience of IPFS data extraction, which is more\nconducive to the timely and long-term tracking treatment of anxious university students.\nKeywords: family systems theory, Guangxi University students, online social anxiety, family process factors, big data"

            "text": "With the development of the Internet, there are at least two different forms of modern human interaction activities, namely, real face-to-face interaction in the traditional social presence space and non-face-to-face network interaction in the absence of field cyberspace. As a new form of social interaction, network interaction is changing the way people interact socially and has become an important way of interpersonal communication. The 2020 Digital Report, published by We Are Social, shows that more than 4.5 billion people use the Internet, and social media users have surpassed 3.8 billion (1). According to the 46th Statistical Report on the Development Status of the Internet in China released by the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), Chinese Internet users reached 940 million by June 2020. The scale of instant messaging users reached 99.0% of the overall Internet users (2). It can be said that socializing through the Internet has become the most important form of human interaction.\nAlong with the popularization of the new medium of interpersonal communication, many researchers have found that the use of social media has brought about many mental health problems. For example, the virtual nature, vulnerability, and uncertainty of online communication lead to reduced online trust, causing interaction anxiety (IA). Social networking data is maliciously collected and leaked by people with the help of big data technology, resulting in content sharing anxiety (SAC) and privacy concern anxiety (PAC) among network users. Online social anxiety is a significant and persistent emotional response of worry, fear, and avoidance behavior to one or more interpersonal situations in the interpersonal exchange of information and emotions based on the Internet and mediated by computers (3). Basic performance behaviors are fear of interacting with others, fear of embarrassing oneself with the content shared, fear of chatting with others online, and fear of others making negative comments about oneself because of the content shared, etc.\nAs the main group of social media users, university students are troubled by \u201cuncertainty,\u201d \u201csocial addiction,\u201d and privacy leakage while gaining access to various convenient services brought by the Internet, thus, giving rise to online social anxiety. In the face of this situation, it has become an inevitable problem to analyze the influencing factors of university students\u2019 online social networking and guide it. As a result, this article will select university students in Guangxi as the research object and take family process factors as the link to empirically analyze the family process factors of online social anxiety in university students in order to provide guidance\nfor the treatment and behavioral improvement of online social anxiety."

            "text": "American scholar M. Bowen and his collaborator M.E. Kerr\u2019s family systems theory (4, 5) considers the family as a \u201cgrouped emotional body\u201d that is the result of the interaction between the \u201cfather-mother-child\u201d triangle in which individuality or separateness and togetherness or fusion are intertwined\u2014 individuality (or separateness) and togetherness (or fusion). Individuality and togetherness are two important balancing agents in the family system. The former seeks independence, while the latter seeks family belonging. Ideally, the family relationship is one in which these two forces are in balance. In this case, family members have their own independence and maintain close ties with each other. Suppose the family relationship is too close and the children are too emotionally involved with their families. In that case, the children will have low levels of Emotional Fusion and Differentiation and will be less independent. Conversely, if they are too distant, they have high levels of Emotional Fusion and Differentiation and are too independent. Both of these imbalance models produce dysregulation of the nuclear family emotional management system, where children need to pay constant attention to their parents\u2019 demands and emotional performance, are unable to think and act according to their own needs, are under high tension for long periods of time, have excessive emotional stress intensity and become increasingly attached to becoming independent, resulting in interpersonal difficulties within the family. Suppose individuals respond to the emotional needs of others by choosing to cluster or choosing Emotional Fusion and Differentiation in a fragmented way. In that case, they will develop anxiety and show anxious behavior.\nBowen\u2019s family systems theory has provided new research ideas for adolescent clinical psychology research. Based on this theory, many scholars have examined the mechanisms by which family systems interact with each other in the psychogenesis and development of adolescents, especially providing a new analytical framework for exploring the influence of parent-child relationship quality on the psychosocial adjustment of family members. Drawing on Bowen\u2019s family systems theory, Williams (6) further generalized the family environment into non-process and process factors based on the presence or absence of family members\u2019 interactions. The non-process factors refer to the members\u2019 own characteristics or inherent characteristics of the\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 870822\nfamily environment, which mainly include static factors, such as family structure, family socioeconomic status, primary provider, primary caregiver, and parents\u2019 own characteristics (7). Process factors refer to the interactions between members within the family system and the family climate formed by the interactions that mainly include the couple relationship, parenting, parentchild relationship, non-only child sibling relationship, and the family climate formed by them.\nChinese and foreign scholars have conducted a large number of studies on the effects of family non-process factors on social anxiety. They mainly involve the effects of gender (8, 9), family structure (10), grade level (11), and family economic and social status (12, 13) on social anxiety. The influence on family process factors involves parenting style (14, 15), family closeness (16), family function (17, 18), and parental conflict (19\u201322). Compared to the non-process factors that influence social anxiety, which are difficult to change, the process factors can be effectively guided and have more plastic value for the benign development of social anxiety. However, from the general status quo of research on family factors of social anxiety at this stage, family process factors are either done as single-factor research, which is in-depth but lacks systematicity, or put into family factors as grand unified research, which does not make specialized distinctions and lacks in-depth insight. Specifically, no directly relevant domestic and international literature has been retrieved on the empirical study of helping university students overcome online social anxiety through the improvement of family process factors."

The 5-point Likert scale was used (not at all, rarely, sometimes, often, and completely), with higher scores indicating\na more severe degree of online social anxiety (24). The Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.928 in this survey.\nFamily process factors include (1) parent-child relationships (poor, fair, and good), and problem behavior theory suggests that a good parent-child relationship will increase their regular behaviors with a corresponding decrease in problem behaviors. (2) Interparental relationships (poor, fair, and good), family dynamics theory suggests that if an individual is in a deteriorating family relationship, it will lead to poor socialization of the child (25). (3) Family climate (poor, fair, and good), research has shown that the more harmonious the family climate is perceived by adolescents, the less they engage in problem behaviors. (4) Parental supervision (rarely, occasionally, and often), according to Jessor\u2019s problem behavior theory, the higher the level of support and control (especially from parents) perceived by adolescents, the less likely they are to engage in problem behaviors (26).

The opposite were risk factors. That is, the more parents punish and control when educating their children, the stronger the domestic violence environment, and the more family conflicts, the higher\nthe incidence of university students\u2019 online social anxiety. On the contrary, good parental and sibling relationships and high intimacy in the family are protective factors to reduce the incidence of Guangxi University students\u2019 online social anxiety.\nThe risk factors among the family process factors that triggered or increased the online social anxiety of university students were poor parental relationships, poor sibling relationships in non-one-child families, and overall family climate disharmony. From the viewpoint of family systems theory, these risk factors occur in the coupled system (high conflict between spouses and strong violent environment) and sibling system (unfriendly sibling relationship), leading to children\u2019s overall perception of poor family climate playing a role in online social anxiety of university students\u2019 promoting effect. It is clear from this that the risky effects of negative family environments occurring in multiple family subsystems are significant, and it is evident that online social anxiety of university students is not the result of the action of a single system in the family but maybe the result of multiple risk systems acting together."

            "text": "According to stress-coping theory, one of the main reasons that adolescents face a variety of risk factors during their development and only a minority of them end up with problems is that these risk factors do not act on the same adolescent at the same time. Adolescents\u2019 own psychological abilities (e.g., mental toughness, high self-efficacy, etc.) counteract the negative consequences of negative factors, a principle that is also valid for online social anxiety. If an adolescent grows up with only one risk factor, such as poor parental relationship\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 870822\nTABLE 2 | Multiple linear regression analysis of online social anxiety (n = 2,373).\nDependent variable: Online social anxiety total score of Guangxi university students\nUnstandardized coefficient Standardization coefficient t Sig\nB Standard error Beta\n(Constant) 36.914 1.446 25.521 0\nGood parental relationship \u22124.094 1.347 \u22120.191 \u22123.04 0.003\nGood family atmosphere \u22124.158 1.548 \u22120.169 \u22122.686 0.008\nGood sibling relationship \u22123.417 1.413 \u22120.151 \u22122.418 0.016\nor weak parental supervision, or sibling tension, the likelihood of online social anxiety in adolescents is low. However, when many risk factors, such as poor parental relationship, sibling disharmony, and family tension, act on adolescents at the same time, there is a high probability that online social anxiety will occur (28).\nDevelopmental psychopathology suggests that the development of social adjustment problems in individuals is influenced by several factors that increase the risk of developing mental illness, while some factors protect individuals from physical and mental illness. Since the occurrence of online social anxiety is the result of a combination of risk factors, the more risk factors there are for online social anxiety interventions, the more protective factors there are to counteract the risk factors. The results of this empirical analysis of the factors influencing the online social anxiety of Guangxi University students showed that the total anxiety score of good parental relationships was on average 4.09 points lower than that of poor parental relationships. The average anxiety score of a good family atmosphere was 4.16 points lower than that of a poor family atmosphere. The average anxiety score of a good sibling relationship was 3.42 points lower than that of a poor sibling relationship, which were the protective factors of family process factors in reducing online social anxiety. A healthy developing adolescent has a positive support system, while a poorly developing adolescent has a negative support system behind him or her. In addition, there is a pattern of \u201cgood together and bad together\u201d between the systems.\nAlthough online social networking makes up for the deficiency of public real interpersonal communication to a certain extent. However, due to the virtuality, vulnerability, and uncertainty of the network, coupled with the proliferation of information, interpersonal overload, and privacy security of online social media, online social networking is mostly superficial and lacks depth, and personal emotional needs cannot be met, which promotes the emergence of online social anxiety and indulges it. As the most important place for emotional breeding and cultivation, the family should become a warm home to avoid and overcome the online social anxiety of university students. Based on the empirical analysis of this thesis, to intervene in the online social anxiety of university students, on the one hand, we need to intervene in the support system behind university students comprehensively. In terms of family process factors, we need to intervene in the coupled system,\nparent-child system, and sibling system in the family as a whole and improve the education and guidance mechanism of protective factors. On the other hand, when we intervene, we can also seize the key points and key links in the system. In the specific implementation method of correcting network anxiety through family, a generalized collaborative framework named collaborative shared healthcare plan (CSHCP) gives us a great idea to correct online social anxiety of university students (29). It is a CSHCP framework for daily life activity recognition and can be used for remote coordination and communication between family members to enhance emotion and avoid addiction to the network. This is more suitable for college students who leave their families to study. For college students with online social anxiety, their personal health records (PHRs) can be maintained using the Star File System (IPFS) (30), and they can access their records online and make targeted corrections at any time."

Based on this, the thesis makes some tentative enquiries into the relationship between family process factors and online social anxiety. Although the statistical value of the sample survey cannot infer the overall trend quantitatively, the survey results of the sample can explain some overall characteristics: that parental relationship, family atmosphere, and sibling relationship influenced online social anxiety of university students. To intervene in the online social anxiety of university students, on the one hand, we need to intervene in the coupled system, parent-child system, and sibling system in the family as a whole and improve the education and guidance mechanism of protective factors. On the other hand, we can also concentrate on the key points and key links in the family process system. Because this study is affected by the randomness of the sampling survey and the limitation of the number of questionnaires, and the understanding of online social anxiety will be more or less subjective, the conclusion of the study is not suitable for popularization and needs further verification.
