 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine long-term impacts of reduced LBP care seeking during the pandemic on outcomes like pain, disability, quality of life, and return to work. Does delayed care seeking lead to worse outcomes? 

2. Investigate barriers and facilitators to seeking LBP care during the pandemic through qualitative research. This could provide insights into why care seeking declined and how to improve access. 

3. Evaluate the effectiveness of telehealth/virtual care options for LBP management during the pandemic. Can telehealth provide similar outcomes compared to in-person care? What modalities work best?

4. Develop and test interventions aimed at encouraging appropriate LBP care seeking during public health crises. For example, education campaigns, decision aids, or care navigation programs. 

5. Conduct similar studies in other low/middle income countries to determine if patterns hold globally. Compare differences across healthcare systems and cultures.
