    "abstractText": "Vinyl acetate is a restricted substance in food products. The quantification of the organic impurities in vinyl acetate is a major problem due to its activity, instability, and volatility. In this paper, while using the mass balance method to determine the purity of vinyl acetate, an improved method was established for the determination of the content of three impurities in vinyl acetate reference material, and the GC-FID peak area normalization for vinyl acetate was calibrated. The three trace organic impurities were identified by gas chromatography tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry to be methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and vinyl propionate. The content and relative correction factors for the three organic impurities were measured. The purity of vinyl acetate determined by the mass balance method was 99.90% with an expanded uncertainty of 0.30%, and the total content of organic impurities was 0.08% with a relative correction factor of 1.23%. The vinyl acetate reference material has been approved as a national certified reference material in China as GBW (E) 062710.",

            "text": "Vinyl acetate is a colorless, flammable liquid with a sweet, ether flavor. Because of the presence of carbon\u2013carbon double bonds, vinyl acetate is active, and chemical reactions, such as addition and polymerization reactions, are prone to occurring [1]. In industry, vinyl acetate is mainly used as a polymer or copolymer monomer in the synthesis of polyvinyl acetate homopolymer emulsions, vinyl acetate ethylene copolymer emulsions, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer emulsions, and other common adhesives that are widely used in the food, construction, and other industries [2\u20135]. Vinyl acetate is irritating to the eyes, skin, mucous membranes, and upper respiratory tract, and long-term exposure can anesthetize nerves. It has been proven that vinyl acetate is carcinogenic to animals, and it is classified as a class 2B carcinogen [6,7]. The food, construction, and other industries in China have restrictions on the allowable content of vinyl acetate in specific industrial products [8]. Therefore, analytical methods for the accurate measurement of vinyl acetate are required in order to provide quality assurance for commercial products. Currently, the reported analysis methods include the saponification [9], thermo-gravimetric [10], nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [11], infrared spectroscopy [12], and gas chromatography (GC) [13] methods. Because of its high accuracy and sensitivity, chromatography is a common method for the quantitative determination of vinyl acetate, and several chromatographic methods have been reported for the quantitative determination of vinyl acetate in food contact materials [14], plastics [15], and white latex [16]. However, chromatographic quantification usually requires a certified reference material (CRM) to prepare a standard solution. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a measurement method for a vinyl acetate\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6245. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28176245 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6245 2 of 16\nCRM and to use this vinyl acetate CRM to make the currently used methods more accurate and convenient. There have been few reports of purity determination methods for vinyl acetate. Accurate purity determination methods are the basis for the development of CRMs, and play an important role in the establishment of measurement traceability, the calibration of instruments, and verification methods [17,18], Therefore, CRMs have important uses in food, medicine, and other fields [19\u201321]. In the development of CRMs, the quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (q-NMR) [22,23], thermal analysis [24,25], and mass balance [26\u201329] methods are commonly used methods for measuring the purity of organic substances. The mass balance method is generally considered to be a relatively high-precision method for purity determination, and can be directly traced back to the SI units of mass (kg) and amount of substance (mol). The mass balance method is one of the main methods for determining the purity of substances in the Organic Analysis Work Group of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures [30]. The mass balance method is also one of the methods for determining the purity of pharmaceutical reference substances that is recommended by the World Health Organization and the European Pharmacopoeia [31,32]. Mass balance, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used by Kang Ma et al. to determine the purity of a theophylline CRM, and the accuracy of the mass balance method was shown to be better than that of the other methods [33]. With the mass balance method, HPLC and GC are frequently used to measure organic components. A mass balance method combined with gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry was used by Wang et al. [34] to determine the content of benzene and to investigate the accuracy of DSC and q-NMR measurements. The mass balance method was used by Chen et al. to assign purity to four unsaturated fatty acid esters; the gas chromatographic area normalization method was used to determine the content of the main components; and the content of volatile impurities, moisture, and non-volatile impurities was calculated [35]. However, because of the nonlinear response of the detector, the percentages calculated from the peak areas were not equal to the percentages of each component. Therefore, a correction factor was introduced by Wang et al. to correct the values for the purity obtained by area normalization to produce more accurate measurement results [36]. However, it is still a challenge to determine vinyl acetate\u2019s purity using the mass balance method, which can mainly be attributed to the difficulty of identifying and quantifying the organic impurities in vinyl acetate. This difficulty occurs because vinyl acetate and the organic impurities in it have small molecular weights and are difficult to separate. Therefore, in the present study, a new pure CRM for vinyl acetate was developed, and a mass balance method was established to determine the purity of the vinyl acetate. The gas chromatographic area normalization results were corrected and recalculated by characterizing and calculating the relative correction factors for three organic impurities in vinyl acetate. In addition, a homogeneity test and stability study were carried out on the prepared vinyl acetate CRM, and the uncertainty of the CRM was evaluated."

It can be seen from the figure that there are four components in the candidate: the main peak at 2.25 min is vinyl acetate and the peaks at 1.96, 2.59, and 3.71 min are three organic impurities, numbered 1#, 2#, and 3#, respectively. The three impurities were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, and the results are shown in Figure 4b\u2013d. The following conclusions can be drawn in accordance with Table 1: (1) In Figure 4b, m/z 74 is the molecular ion peak of CH3COOCH3, m/z 59 is the free radical CH3COO+ formed after [CH3COOCH3]+ is cleaved to remove CH3\u2022, m/z 43 is the ion peak of CH3C\u2261O+ formed after cleavage, and m/z 29 is the ion peak of CH3CH2\u2022 cleavage; therefore, impurity #1 may be methyl acetate.

The results of the mass spectrometry analysis were verified by gas chromatography experiments, and the results are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a shows a typical chromatogram. The retention times of the three impurities were 12.52, 15.86, and 18.49 min. A comparison of these results with the spectra after the addition of methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and vinyl propionate standard samples indicated that the impurity with a response time of 12.52 min was methyl acetate, the impurity with a response time of 15.86 min was ethyl acetate, and the impurity with a response time of 18.49 min was vinyl propionate (Figure 5b\u2013d), which was consistent with the mass spectrometry results.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6245 6 of 16\nImpurity #2 2.59 min\n88.0520 88.0519 C4H8O2 70.0410 70.0143 C4H6O 61.0281 61.0284 C2H5O2 43.0174 43.0178 C2H3O\nImpurity #3 3.71 min\n100.02 100.02 C5H8O2 57.0337 57.0335 C3H5O 43.0176 43.0178 C2H3O 29.0382 29.0386 C2H5\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 16 are the fragment ions CH3CH2C\u2261O+, CH3C\u2261O+, and CH3CH2\u2022, respectively, formed after the cleavage of CH3CH2COOCH=CH2; therefore, impurity #3 is vinyl propionate.\nTable 1.

Preparation method: Acetic acid, ethylene, and oxygen underwent a gas phase reaction under the action of a catalyst. After the reaction was completed, the obtained mixture was purified by rectification three times, and finally, vinyl acetate raw material was obtained. The material was cooled to \u221218 \u25e6C and dispensed into 2 mL brown ampoules under nitrogen protection, and the ampoules were immediately sealed.

First, 100 mL of Karl Fischer reagent was added into the calibrated instrument, the vibration frequency of the oscillator was set to 155 r/min, and the solution was mixed evenly. Then, approximately 1 mL of vinyl acetate CRM was added and reacted to the end point under the protection of nitrogen. A blank experiment was performed to ensure the accuracy of the test data.\n(4) Determination of inorganic impurities\nThe mass fraction of inorganic impurities in the CRM candidate was measured using ICP-MS. The instrument parameters were as follows: the radio frequency power was 1300 W; the carrier gas flow rate was 1.20 L/min; the sampling rate was 0.1 r/s; and the measurement was repeated three times in the full quantitative analysis mode. The measurement method was as follows: 1 mL of candidate CRM was transferred to a 10 mL volumetric flask, diluted to volume with deionized water, shaken well, and used directly for ICP-MS.\n(5) Determination of acid\nA Mettler T50 potentiometric titrator was used to measure the content of organic acids. The measurement method was as follows: 1.5 mL of vinyl acetate solution was added to the potentiometric titrator, and calibrated sodium hydroxide solution was automatically added dropwise to the titration end point.
