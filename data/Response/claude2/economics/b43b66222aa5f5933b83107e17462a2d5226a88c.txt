 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Study the computational complexity of finding DEF-k allocations for non-constant k. The paper shows hardness for constant k, but leaves open the complexity for arbitrary k. This could lead to improved algorithms or hardness results.

2. Investigate existence and algorithms for DEF-k along with other efficiency notions besides Pareto-optimality. For example, maximizing social welfare or minimizing maximum chore envy.

3. Explore restricted domains where finding minimal k for DEF-k can be solved efficiently. The paper gives complexity results for general valuations, but there may be special cases that admit algorithms.

4. Empirically evaluate performance of algorithms for finding small k DEF-k allocations on real-world data sets from applications like task allocation. Compare with notions like EF1. 

5. Consider fairness notions that bound maximum envy rather than eliminate all envy. For example, find allocations where no agent envies another by more than k. This could lead to fairer allocations with fewer dubious chores.
