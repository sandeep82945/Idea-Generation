Cross-Domain Application of DIMS Models: Exploring the use of discrete interval mobile seasonalities (DIMS) in forecasting for other industries or domains, such as water usage, telecommunications traffic, or transportation demand, where special events or irregular seasonal patterns significantly impact demand. This research could evaluate the adaptability and effectiveness of the DIMS model in different contexts and identify necessary modifications to optimize performance across various sectors.

Integration with Renewable Energy Sources: Investigating how the forecasting models could be adapted or expanded to incorporate data from renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, which are becoming increasingly significant in the electricity mix. This research would address the challenges of forecasting demand in systems with high renewable penetration, including the variability and uncertainty associated with these energy sources.

Real-time Data and Forecasting Accuracy: Developing methods to incorporate real-time data into the forecasting models to improve accuracy. This could involve integrating Internet of Things (IoT) data, social media trends, or weather forecasts in real-time to adjust demand forecasts more dynamically. Research could focus on the technical challenges of processing and analyzing large data streams and the impact on forecast accuracy and computational efficiency.

Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: Exploring the use of more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, to enhance the prediction models. This research could compare the performance of these techniques against the current hybrid models of Holt-Winters and neural networks, focusing on improvements in accuracy, scalability, and the ability to capture complex nonlinear patterns in electricity demand.

Economic and Policy Implications of Improved Forecasting: Analyzing the economic and policy implications of more accurate electricity demand forecasting. This could include studies on the potential for reduced operational costs, improved energy market efficiency, and enhanced integration of renewable energy sources. Additionally, research could explore how improved forecasting impacts policy decisions related to energy infrastructure investment, regulation, and efforts to achieve sustainability goals.
