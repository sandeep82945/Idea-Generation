Exploration of Differentiable Economics for Multi-Good Mechanisms Beyond Uniform Distributions: Future work could explore the application of differentiable economics in designing optimal market-making mechanisms for a wider variety of trader valuation distributions beyond the uniform case, including distributions with heavy tails, multimodality, or those that exhibit significant skewness or kurtosis. This would help in understanding how market makers can optimize their strategies in more complex and realistic market environments.

Adaptive Market Making Strategies in Dynamic Environments: Research could focus on developing market making strategies that adapt to changing market conditions in real-time. This includes the integration of reinforcement learning and other adaptive algorithms to dynamically adjust market making strategies based on evolving market dynamics, trader behaviors, and external economic indicators.

Bundling and Payment "In Kind" in Complex Financial Instruments: Investigating the application of bundling strategies and accepting payment "in kind" in the context of more complex financial instruments and derivatives. This would involve studying optimal market making in environments with financial instruments that have more complex payoff structures than simple goods or tokens.

Cross-Market Market Making and Arbitrage: Researching optimal market making strategies that operate across multiple markets or asset classes simultaneously. This includes the study of cross-market arbitrage opportunities and how market makers can leverage information and positions across different markets to optimize their overall profitability.

Theoretical and Practical Implications of Mechanism Design in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Expanding the study to the design and theoretical underpinnings of automated market makers in the context of DeFi, focusing on how different mechanism designs impact liquidity, price stability, and trader behavior in decentralized markets. This would also involve empirical studies on existing DeFi platforms to validate theoretical models and conjectures.
