Unfortunately, TCH is not easily degraded with high resistance due to the complex molecular structure and hepatotoxicity,1,2 even worse, its residues can remain in the water and soil for a long time, resulting in the appearance of the drug resistance genes and endangering human and environmental health.3,4 Conventional treatment technologies of TCH in the water system include chemical precipitation, biodegradation, ozonation, physical adsorption, and photocatalytic degradation.5\u20137 Among these technologies, photocatalysis, one of the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), has been attracting considerable attention due to its pollution-free, eco-friendly, and efficiency.8\u201311 However, most conventional photocatalysis can only use ultraviolet light, which accounts for only 5% of the sunlight,12 such as TiO2. To improve the utilization of light, there is an increasing emphasis on photodegradable materials that can be used to operate under visible light.\nLanzhou 730000, China.

In detail, ZIF-L was used as a sacricial agent to prepare porous carriers of ZnO, and subsequently BiOI nanosheets grew in situ on the inner surface of porous ZnO nanoparticles by a solvothermal method to prepare a stable \u201chydrangea-like\u201d N\u2013ZnO/ BiOI composite. Next, the THC was used to assess the photocatalytic activity of the N\u2013ZnO/BiOI nanocomposite. Under visible light, the photocatalytic activity of the N\u2013ZnO/BiOI for TCH was signicantly improved compared to pristine BiOI and N\u2013ZnO, demonstrating excellent potential for practical applications."

As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the ZIF-L crystal presented leaf-like morphology and a size of about 2 \u00d7 5 mm which were consistent with earlier literature.43 The ZIF-L phase structure of the product was shown using the XRD pattern, indicating that all peaks corresponded well with the simulated ZIF-L (Fig. S1\u2020). Because of the low stability of ZIF-L, when it was sintered together, some of the morphology was likely retained. The ower-spherical structure was composed of nanosheets of bare BiOI in Fig. 1d and e, while the samples exhibited N\u2013ZnO uniformly embedded in the oweryspherical BiOI when compared to the as-synthesized complexes (Fig. 1f). Simultaneously, it was also evident that the N\u2013ZnO could signicantly prevent the agglomeration of the BiOI during the reaction and accelerate the separation of charge carrier. The EDS mapping (Fig. 2g) conrmed that the N\u2013ZnO was successfully embedded in the BiOI, forming the hydrangealike N\u2013ZnO/BiOI-1 compounds.

All of these certicated that the photocatalysts were successfully prepared.\nThe crystalline structures of the BiOI, N\u2013ZnO, and the asprepared compounds were examined by XRD, and the results are shown in Fig. 2a. All the diffraction peaks of the pristine N\u2013 ZnO and BiOI were in accordance with standard ZnO (JCPDS NO.99-0111)41 and BiOI (JCPDS NO.73-2062)45,46 data, respectively. The diffraction peaks of N\u2013ZnO/BiOI composites were similar to those of BiOI, illustrating that the synthesis process did not alter the pristine structure of BiOI. The lack of distinct N\u2013ZnO peaks might be due to the low doping levels and similarity between the diffraction peaks of N\u2013ZnO and BiOI, which obscured the N\u2013ZnO peaks. Therefore, in order to further validate the presence of N\u2013ZnO in these compounds, the FT-IR spectra were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. In the case of bare BiOI, the bands in the range of 400\u2013800 cm\u22121 were due to the Bi\u2013O stretching mode, which included the asymmetrical stretching vibration of Bi\u2013O at 770 cm\u22121.47,48 For N\u2013ZnO, the band located at 1397 cm\u22121 and 1536 cm\u22121 were assigned to the stretching vibrational of the Zn\u2013N and C]C bonds, respectively, while the bands between 400 and 600 cm\u22121 could be ascribed to the Zn\u2013O bond.49 Noteworthy, the bands of the N\u2013 ZnO/BiOI composites not only include the characteristic bands of BiOI, but also the feature bands of the N\u2013ZnO, indicating that the N\u2013ZnO does successfully integrate with BiOI.\nTo further detect the surface electronic states of these samples, XPS spectra were carried out to achieve the target, as depicted in Fig. 2c\u2013h. The binding energy of the XPS spectra was calibrated by the C 1s (284.8 eV). The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of N\u2013ZnO/BiOI-1 showed binding energies for C\u2013C (284.8 eV), C\u2013O/CN (286.3 eV), and O]C]O (288.4 eV), respectively (Fig. 2c).

The results of the XPS further conrmed that the N\u2013ZnO/BiOI-1 complexes were successfully prepared.\nAs shown in Fig. S2a,\u2020 the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms are used to examine the particular surface areas. According to the result, BiOI and N\u2013ZnO/BiOI-1 exhibit type IV adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms with an H3 hysteresis loop, and N\u2013ZnO expresses type II adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms. These imply that the BiOI and N\u2013ZnO/BiOI-1 are a porous structure, whereas N\u2013ZnO has nearly no pores, which is in line with the ndings in Fig. S2b.\u2020 Additionally, the specic surface areas and other related information of the catalysts are displayed in Table S1,\u2020 among which the specic surface areas of BOI, N\u2013ZnO and N\u2013ZnO/BiOI-1 are 55.648, 1.656 and 69.156 m2 g\u22121, respectively. Obviously, N\u2013ZnO/BiOI-1 has the biggest specic surface area which is attributed to the addition of the N\u2013ZnO that improves the stacking of nanosheets of BiOI. Consequently, there will be more active sites available and facilitate the adsorption of TCH, increasing the photocatalytic performance."

Obviously, the degradation of TCH was negligible for the experiment without a catalyst via a blank experiment.

Fig. S3a\u2020 shows that the inuence of pH on TCH degradation under the conditions of the dosage was 20 mg and the concentration of the TCH was 10 mg L\u22121. It was obviously that the degradation rate was faster when pH = 9 than the other pH, achieving 91.8% within 160 min. By contrast, aer dark adsorption for 160 min, the degradation rate of pH = 3, pH = 4.8 (nature), pH = 5, and pH= 7 was 83.04%, 88.59%, 77.52% and 86.76%, respectively. It could be concluded that since there was no signicant difference in the degradation effect by pH, the experiments were conducted at natural pH conditions.\n3.3.3 Effects of photocatalyst dosage. Fig. S3b\u2020 demonstrates the inuence of different photocatalyst dosages on TCH degradation under the condition of the pH was 4.8 (nature) and the concentration of TCH was 10 mg L\u22121. Apparently, when the amount of photocatalyst delivery was 20 mg, the degradation rate exhibited superior performance. This could be interpreted that the number of photogenerated carriers and more reactive sites could be provided which would be a benet for improving photocatalytic efficiency by increasing the dosage of the photocatalyst. Nevertheless, when the dosage was added to a certain extent, the photocatalytic degradation did not increase as expected but rather decreased. This was probably due to the increased turbidity of the solution, which lowered light transmission and had a negative effect.\n3.3.4 Effects of TCH initial concentration. Fig. S3c\u2020 displays that the inuence of different photocatalyst concentrations on TCH degradation under the conditions of the pH was 4.8 (nature) and the dosage was 20 mg. It could be deduced that the rate of photocatalytic degradation was greatest when the concentration of TCH was 10 mg L\u22121, which might be explained by the fact that when increasing concentrations of solutions became available, more intermediates were formed and accumulated. Therefore, it would compete with the active oxidizing substances produced in the photocatalytic system and inhibit the degradation of THC."

            "text": "To determine the main active species produced, reactive species trapping experiments for photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline were performed on N\u2013ZnO/BiOI hybrids. In this regard, p-Benzoquinone (PBQ), iso-propyl alcohol (IPA), and methanol (MeOH) were chosen as the scavengers for $O2\n\u2212, $OH and h+, respectively. According to Fig. 5a, the degradation efficiency of\n1940 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 1936\u20131942\ntetracycline decreased with the addition of MeOH and PBQ, from 88.59% to 82.92 and 59.54%, respectively, suggesting that $O2\n\u2212 played a key role in the photocatalytic reduction of TCH. Furthermore, when IPA was added to the degradation studies, it was shown that IPA could swily capture $OH, and effectively promote the degradation efficiency.\nThe valence band (VB)-XPS of BiOI and N\u2013ZnO is shown in Fig. 5b, and the VB potentials (EVB) of the BiOI and N\u2013ZnO are 1.37 and 2.46 eV (vs. a normal hydrogen electrode [NHE], based on the following formula),55,56 respectively. Therefore, the conduction band (CB) potentials (ECB) were \u22120.53 and \u22120.68 eV for BiOI and N\u2013ZnO, respectively.\nENHE = F + EVBM \u2212 4.44\nECB = EVB \u2212 Eg\nwhere the electron work function (F) of the used XPS analyzer is 4.00 eV, ENHE and EVBM indicate the potentials of an NHE and the VB maximum (VBM), respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 5b, the degradation mechanism could be inferred from the experimental ndings. Electrons can hop from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) under simulated sunlight, lling the CB with free electrons and leaving holes in the VB. In this experiment, the semiconductors of N\u2013ZnO and BiOI are n- and p-type, respectively, leading to different Fermi levels. Therefore, when the N\u2013ZnO and BiOI come into contact, the interfacial charge transfer occurs,41,46 resulting in the formation of the inner electric eld.57\u201359 The electrons on the CB of N\u2013ZnO will recombine with the holes on the VB of BiOI due to the action of the built-in electric eld, and thus the holes on the VB of the N\u2013ZnO can directly oxidize degradation TCH; simultaneously, the electrons can react with H2O to form $OH radicals. Additionally, the electrons on the CB of N\u2013ZnO are lower than O2/$O2\n\u2212 (\u22120.330 eV vs. NHE),60 suggesting that the e\u2212can react with oxygen to generate $O2 \u2212\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "In summary, an efficient photocatalytic N\u2013ZnO/BiOI composite had been successfully prepared via a simple hydrothermal synthetic strategy. The structure and chemical composition of these as-synthesized samples were studied by SEM, TEM, XPS, and FT-IR. At the same time, the electrochemical properties were evaluated by PL and EIS. Next, the effect of different conditions on the experiment was examined, such as the amount of N\u2013ZnO doping, solution pH, catalyst delivery, and solution concentration. Through the experiments, it could be seen that under natural pH conditions with a solution concentration of 10 mg L\u22121 and a dose of 10 mg, N\u2013ZnO/BiOI-1 exhibited the most superior photocatalytic degradation ability which could degrade 88.4% in 160 min. The radical trapping experiments showed that $O2\n\u2212 radicals and h+ radicals were the important reactive species in the photocatalytic degradation of TCH. Overall, this highly efficient photocatalytic N\u2013ZnO/BiOI composite have provided an effective aid for the development of new and efficient water treatment technologies.\nAuthor contributions\nX.
