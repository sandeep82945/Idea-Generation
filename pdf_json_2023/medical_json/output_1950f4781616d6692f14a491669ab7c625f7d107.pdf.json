In this regard, the focus of this article is on optimization of the runner shape. To this end, the lengths of the first and second acceleration sections (L1 and L2), and the angles between the first and second acceleration sections and between the second and third sections (\u03b11 and \u03b12) are considered as the rotor parameters. Simulations were conducted using multiple discrete elements to explore the influence of multiple input parameters on the response value, and a regression model was established between the parameters and the particle injection rate. The experimental results show that the selected parameters significantly affect the rate of particle injection, and the interactions between the parameters L1 and L2, and between L2 and \u03b12 have the largest effects. The results reveal that applying the optimized parameters improves the particle injection speed by 7.85% when compared to the preoptimization model. This improvement in the rotor acceleration provides the basis for improving the efficiency of centrifugal impact moulding of metal powders.\nStudies show that accelerated powder particles impinging on a solid-state substrate can provide a coating on the substrate surface by producing a large plastic strain deposit1\u20135. In this technology, the velocity of the particles is the key factor in combining the particle with the substrate after impact. Currently, the common particle acceleration methods include the airflow acceleration method, mechanical acceleration method, electromagnetic acceleration method, ultrasonic acceleration method and electrostatic acceleration method. It is worth noting that each method has advantages and limitations and can be employed in various applications. In this context, the airflow acceleration method has attracted many researchers focusing on the optimization of jet structures to increase the acceleration capacity of particles. Wan6 studied the effect of the various parameters of the powder jet on the impact velocity and particle distribution and developed a mathematical hydrodynamic model. Gao7 proposed the degree of aggregation (PAD) concept and analysed the effects of the nozzle geometry on the powder flow. Cao8 designed the nozzle geometry based on the selected particles and propellant gases for ejected particles to reach the maximum impact velocity. Furthermore, Buhl9 established an analytical model, analysed the motion of the particles, and modified the nozzle structure based on CFD simulation results. Forero-Sossa10 investigated the effect of the nozzle geometry on the deposition of hydroxy-apatite particles in LPCS and demonstrated that the nozzle geometry affects the coating uniformity. Zavalan11 employed an objective multi-optimization method to optimize the nozzle structure and improve nozzle performance. Klinkov12 employed a cylindrical barrel with a double-edged bevelled exit vortex to generate a high-speed two-phase flow. This approach was suggested as an alternative to cold spray nozzles. To resolve the shortcomings of conventional DeLaval nozzles in the cold-air dynamic spraying process, Liao13 proposed a modified nozzle structure and verified its acceleration performance through numerical simulations. In all the aforementioned studies, it was observed that the internal structure of the flow channel exhibits a substantial influence on the acceleration effect of powder particles.\nBased on the performed literature survey, the focus of present study is on investigating the mechanical acceleration of powder particles using centrifugal throw rotors. To this end, the acceleration process involving the throwing of rotors with variously shaped runners is simulated using EDEM discrete-element software. The main objective of this article is to analyse the influences of the runner control parameters on the injection velocity of\nOPEN\n1School of Mechatronics Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, 471003, Henan, China. 2College of Agricultural Equipment Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471003, Henan, China. 3Joint Engineering Research Center for Abrasion Control and Moulding of Metal Materials, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471003, Henan, China. 4School of Materials Science and Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471003, Henan, China. *email: sunbo2020@haust.edu.cn\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:18878 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46359-7\nparticles, establish a model to numerically analyse the influencing factors, and optimize the control parameters of the runner to improve the rotor acceleration performance."

            "text": "In this article, the discrete element method is chosen as the simulation technique. This selection is made primarily because the perturbation of the particle motion caused by the airflow is often neglected when analysing the effect of the flow channel structure on the particle acceleration performance14\u201317. The fundamental idea behind the discrete element method is to consider the medium as a discrete body. Then the structure is discretized into independent elements and particles, where each particle is assumed to Newton\u2019s second law of motion. In this approach, the macroscopic motion of the entire medium is calculated by iteratively solving the governing equation18,19. To simulate the particle motion using the discrete unitary method, vibrational equations of motion are used to model particle\u2012particle collisions and the motion of particles at boundaries20,21.\nModelling particle accelerating rotors The rotor\u2019s internal structure of the runner consists of two elements: the runner modelling line and the section contour line, as shown in Fig.\u00a01A, the former determines the structural characteristics of the runner and the latter determines the cross-sectional shape of the runner .The runner modelling line is composed of multi-segment lines, and the following five parameters are implemented for line control: the lengths of the first acceleration section (L1), the lengths of the second acceleration section (L2), the lengths of the third acceleration section (L3), the angle between the first and second acceleration sections (\u03b11) and the angle between the second and third accelerating sections (\u03b12). These parameters, which are referred to as shape parameters, are shown in Fig.\u00a01B. The parameter L3 can be calculated from L1, L2, \u03b11, \u03b12 and the known rotor radius (R) using Eq. (1). Therefore, the rotor optimization design is tested with the four key parameters L1, L2, \u03b11, and \u03b12 in a vehicle.\nThe rotor is modelled using the SolidWorks software platform, and its internal and external structures are illustrated in Fig.\u00a02.

The use of the BBD response surface method allows complex unknown functional relationships between the target quantity and input factors to be fitted with simple primary or quadratic polynomial models over a small area, which is computationally easier and ensures the continuity of the predictive model. Using this method and performing ANOVA on their experimental data, this regression model can be obtained and solved for the optimal combination of parameters can be determined.\nThe empirical levels were determined based on the results obtained from the BBD tests shown in Table\u00a04.

Furthermore, based on the contents of Table\u00a07, the R2 and adjusted R2 values in the model are all close to one, indicating a good fit of the regression model. The predicted R2 reasonably agrees with the adjusted R2, with a difference of less than 0.2. The coefficient of variation and precision are 0.25% and 27.23, respectively, indicating that the fitted regression model has a high degree of reliability.\nThe P-values in Table\u00a06 for the parameters L1, L2, \u03b11, and \u03b12 indicate that all four test factors have a highly significant effect on the injection velocity of particles. Among them, the effects of L1, \u03b11, and \u03b12 are more significant compared to that of L2. The presented results in Table\u00a06 obtained from the one-way ANOVA confirm that the parameters L1, \u03b11, and \u03b12 significantly affect the particle injection rate, while the effect of the parameter L2 is relatively smaller.\nThe parameters L1, L2, \u03b11, and \u03b12 were selected as independent variables and denoted as x1, x2, x3, and x4, respectively. Moreover, the injection velocity of particles, denoted as V, was selected as the target variable. The least-squares method was employed to optimize the regression model. In the optimization process, four groups of single-factor first-order terms, four groups of single-factor second-order terms, and six groups of interactivefactor second-order terms were considered. Since the P-value reflects the significance of each factor in the model, when P \u2264 0.01, the factor is considered highly significant; when 0.01 < P < 0.05, the factor is significant; and when P \u2265 0.05, the factor is not significant. The model can be optimized according to the P-value of each factor. Consequently, the terms BC (interaction terms for L2 and \u03b11) and B2 (the quadratic term for L2) with P > 0.05 were excluded from the model. The regression model for the injection rate V can be expressed as follows:\nFigure\u00a04. Simulation model.

            "text": "The influence of the runners\u2019 shape parameters on the injection rate The effect of the individual parameters on the injection velocity Figure\u00a05 provides insights into the influence of individual design parameters on the injection velocity. Figure\u00a05a depicts the effect of L1 on the injection rate when L2, \u03b11, and \u03b12 are held constant at their median values. Similarly, Fig.\u00a05b shows the impact of L2 on the injection rate while maintaining L1, \u03b11, and \u03b12 at their median values. Figure\u00a05c demonstrates the influence of \u03b11 on the injection rate with L1, L2, and \u03b12 set at their median values. Finally, Fig.\u00a05d illustrates the effect of \u03b12 on injection velocity when L1, L2, and \u03b11 are held constant at their median values.\nIn general, the design parameters L1, \u03b11, and \u03b12 exhibit a negative correlation with the injection velocity, while the parameter L2 shows a positive correlation. The trend for each parameter can be described as follows:\n\u2013 As the parameter L1 increases from 40 to 60\u00a0mm, the injection velocity increases slightly. However, when L1 exceeds 60\u00a0mm, the ejecta velocity decreases. \u2013 When the parameter L2 varies in the range of 20\u00a0mm to 60\u00a0mm, there is a positive correlation between L2 and the ejection velocity. \u2013 When the design parameters \u03b11 and \u03b12 increase from 30 to 50 and from 10 to 30, respectively, the ejection velocity decreases.\nThe results reveal that L1, L2, \u03b11, and \u03b12 affect the particle injection velocity. The optimized design involves setting the parameter L1 around the median value (60 mm), selecting the maximal value of 60 mm for L2, and choosing the minimum values (30 and 10) for \u03b11 and \u03b12, respectively. Meanwhile, it is necessary to analyse the interaction between various factors.\nThe influence of the multi\u2011model parameter interactions on the injection rate Design-Expert13 software was utilized to generate 3D response surface plots depicting the interaction effects of each shape parameter. The results align with those of the ANOVA analysis: PL1\u03b12(0.0001) < PL1\u03b11(0.0001) < P\u03b11\u03b12(0.0007) < PL2\u03b12(0.0058) < PL1L2(0.0196) . The interaction between the L1 and L2 parameters exhibits the most substantial impact on the particle injection velocity among the various parameter interactions. Then the interaction between the parameters L2 and \u03b12 has a comparatively smaller effect, while the interaction between the parameters \u03b11 and \u03b12 has a much smaller effect. Last, the interactions between the parameters L2 and parameters \u03b12 and L2 and \u03b12 exhibit the weakest effects. The interaction effects of the pair of parameters L1 and L2, L2 and \u03b12, and \u03b11 and \u03b12 are analysed.\nThe interaction between the parameters L1 (ranging from 40 to 90\u00a0mm) and L2 (ranging from 20 to 60\u00a0mm) is illustrated in Fig.\u00a06a, b. It is observed that as the values of L1 increase and the values of L2 decrease, the contour lines become along the 135 contour. This indicates a decrease in the jet velocity, which gradually transitions to an acceleration effect. Based on the distribution of the contours, the entire response surface has a maximum point of approximately 70\u00a0mm for L1 and 50\u00a0mm for L2. This implies that the length of each acceleration section should be relatively constant in a multi-segment model and that the difference in length should be minimized. For example, when L1 = 90\u00a0mm and L2 = 20\u00a0mm, the particle jet velocity reaches its minimum value.\nFigure\u00a07a, b illustrate the interaction effect of the parameters L2 (20\u00a0mm to 60\u00a0mm) and \u03b12 (10\u201330). It is observed that for the parameter L2 with a value of 60\u00a0mm and \u03b12 with a value of 10, the peak of the entire response surface is at the top right. Furthermore, the contours gradually concentrate in the direction of the lower righthand corner, and the degree of curvature increases gradually indicating that as the value of \u03b12 is increased from 30 to 10, the effect on the L2 increases gradually. This result demonstrates that a too-large angle between the acceleration sections affects the overall acceleration effect of the rotor.\nFigure\u00a08a, b illustrate the interaction analysis of the parameters \u03b11 and \u03b12. When the parameters \u03b11 and \u03b12 vary in the range of 30 to 40 and 10 to 20, respectively, the value of the response face has a high level of significance. The results also show a decreasing contour that thickens along 45, indicating that the particle jet velocity drops\nStatistical indicator Value"

This finding further confirms that the angle between the accelerating sections should not be too large.\nThrough the discussion of the independent effect of a single parameter and the interaction of multiple parameters on the spraying speed, we can conclude that the internal flow channel structure of the rotor has an important influence on the acceleration process of particles in which there exists a quantitative relationship between the structural parameters and the particle spraying speed (the acceleration capacity of the particles), which can be solved through the establishment of a mathematical model of this relationship. This change in acceleration is characterized by the acceleration process of powder particles in cold spraying25\u201329, which can be achieved by changing the nozzle structure to increase the acceleration capacity. However, due to the lack of analysis of the overall force on the acceleration process of individual particles in the current study, it is not yet possible to completely correspond the change in the runner structure to the acceleration process of the particles, and therefore, the current acquisition of the mathematical model is still based on the statistical foundations.\nFigure\u00a05.

Simultaneously, the EDEM simulation test of the rotor with a through-hole runner showed a particle injection speed of 545.00\u00a0m/s as illustrated in Fig.\u00a010. By optimizing the runner design, the particle injection speed was increased by 7.85%, demonstrating that the capability of the jet rotor can be improved through runner optimization."

Simulations of the particle acceleration by rotors with different parameters were conducted based on the discrete cell method. In addition, the rotor acceleration performances before and after parameter optimization were compared. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows.\nFigure\u00a08.

Acceleration of particles by the rotor after parameters optimization. This figure illustrates the acceleration of the particles by the rotor after shape parameter optimization.\n11\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:18878 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46359-7\n(1) In this study, the accelerated rotor is modelled using SolidWorks and its acceleration performance is simulated using EDEM. By analysing the simulation results of 25 groups of rotors, a multivariate nonlinear regression model is established for the first time based on rotor parameters. (2) By analysing the regression model, it is proven that all four modelling parameters have significant effects on the particle ejection velocity. It was found that L1, \u03b11, and \u03b12 are negatively correlated with the injection speed, while L2 exhibits a positive correlation. The interaction between L1 and L2 had the largest effect, followed by the interaction between L2 and \u03b12, whereas the interaction between \u03b11 and \u03b12 had a smaller effect, and the interaction of the other factors was not significant. (3) The accelerating rotor parameters were optimized using a regression model for parametric optimization. By analysing the simulation results, the improvement in the rotor acceleration capacity before and after optimization is 7.85%.\nThe results show that the optimization of the rotor parameters can enhance the acceleration capacity for particles, which provides a feasible solution for improving the quality and efficiency of the centrifugal impact caused by metal powders. However, further improvement of this forming method requires in-depth studies of more complex rotor structures and forming environmental conditions, as well as the optimization of the forming process control strategies."
