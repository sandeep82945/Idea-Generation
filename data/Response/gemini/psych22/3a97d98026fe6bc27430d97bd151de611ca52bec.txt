1. **Investigate the relationship between self-talk frequency and mindfulness practice in different populations.** The current study found that mindfulness practice did not moderate the relationship between self-talk frequency and trait mindfulness. However, this study was conducted with a relatively small sample of undergraduate students. Future research could replicate this study with a larger and more diverse sample to see if the results hold up. Additionally, future research could explore the relationship between self-talk frequency and mindfulness practice in different populations, such as people with anxiety or depression.


2. **Examine the effects of mindfulness interventions on self-talk frequency and content.** The current study was correlational, so it cannot establish a causal relationship between mindfulness practice and self-talk frequency or content. Future research could use experimental designs to examine the effects of mindfulness interventions on self-talk frequency and content. For example, researchers could compare the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention to a control condition on self-talk frequency and content in people with anxiety or depression.


3. **Explore the relationship between self-talk and other cognitive variables, such as rumination and worry.** The current study focused on the relationship between self-talk and trait mindfulness and self-compassion. Future research could explore the relationship between self-talk and other cognitive variables, such as rumination and worry. For example, researchers could examine whether self-talk frequency or content is associated with rumination or worry in people with anxiety or depression.


4. **Investigate the role of self-talk in the development and maintenance of psychopathology.** The current study did not examine the role of self-talk in the development and maintenance of psychopathology. Future research could explore this relationship by examining the relationship between self-talk frequency or content and the development of psychopathology in longitudinal studies. Additionally, future research could examine the role of self-talk in the maintenance of psychopathology by examining the relationship between self-talk frequency or content and treatment outcomes in people with psychopathology.


5. **Develop and evaluate interventions that target self-talk to improve psychological well-being.** The current study suggests that self-talk may be a potential target for interventions to improve psychological well-being. Future research could develop and evaluate interventions that target self-talk to improve psychological well-being in people with psychopathology or other mental health conditions. For example, researchers could develop an intervention that teaches people how to identify and challenge negative self-talk and replace it with more positive self-talk.
