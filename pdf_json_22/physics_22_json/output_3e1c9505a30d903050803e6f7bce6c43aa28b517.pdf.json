    "abstractText": "We update the Standard Model (SM) predictions for B-meson lifetimes within the heavy quark expansion (HQE). Including for the first time the contribution of the Darwin operator, SU(3)F breaking corrections to the matrix element of dimension-six four-quark operators and the so-called eye-contractions, we obtain for the total widths \u0393(B+) = (0.58+0.11 \u22120.07) ps\u22121, \u0393(Bd) = (0.63+0.11 \u22120.07) ps\u22121, \u0393(Bs) = (0.63+0.11 \u22120.07) ps\u22121, and for the lifetime ratios \u03c4(B)/\u03c4(Bd) = 1.086\u00b1 0.022, \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) = 1.003\u00b1 0.006 (1.028\u00b1 0.011). The two values for the last observable arise from using two different sets of input for the non-perturbative parameters \u03bc\u03c0(Bd), \u03bcG(Bd), and \u03c1D(Bd) as well as from different estimates of the SU(3)F breaking in these parameters. Our results are overall in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental data, however, there seems to emerge a tension in \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) when considering the second set of input parameters. Specifically, this observable is extremely sensitive to the size of the parameter \u03c1D(Bd) and of the SU(3)F breaking effects in \u03bc\u03c0, \u03bcG and \u03c1D; hence, it is of utmost importance to be able to better constrain all these parameters. In this respect, an extraction of \u03bc\u03c0(Bs), \u03bcG(Bs), \u03c1D(Bs) from future experimental data on inclusive semileptonic Bs-meson decays or from direct nonperturbative calculations, as well as more insights about the value of \u03c1D(B) extracted from fits to inclusive semileptonic B-decays, would be very helpful in reducing the corresponding theory uncertainties.",

            "text": "The total decay width \u0393 or equivalently its inverse, the total lifetime \u03c4 = \u0393\u22121, defines one of the fundamental properties of elementary and composite particles, and hence represents an observable of phenomenological primary importance. Moreover, in particular for the case of heavy hadrons, the study of lifetimes can provide an interesting playground to test our understanding of the weak and the strong interactions. Experimentally, the lifetimes of B mesons are determined very precisely by now [1] (based on the measurements in refs. [2\u201361]). The values in table 1 show that the lightest B mesons have roughly the same lifetime and that in the ratio \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) all differences seem to almost cancel out. The improvement of the experimental determination for this ratio over the last 20 years can be read off figure 1. Interestingly, the recent measurement of \u0393s by ATLAS [56] deviates from the most recent ones by LHCb [62\u201364] and CMS [58] by 2\u2212 4\u03c3 \u2014 an experimental clarification of the origin of these discrepancies is of course highly desirable. On the theoretical side, inclusive decay widths of heavy hadrons can by systematically computed in the framework of the heavy quark expansion (HQE), see e.g. the review [65]. Predictions for lifetime ratios of B mesons based on this method trace back to the 80s and a selection of results is given in table 2. According to the HQE the total decay rate of the Bq meson, \u0393(Bq), with q = (u, d, s),1 can be expressed as a series expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass. Due to the large value of the b-quark mass in comparison to a\n1Note that we only consider bound states of the b and a light quark. In the case of the Bc meson the HQE must be properly generalised to describe two weakly decaying heavy quarks, see refs. [66\u201368].\n\u2013 1 \u2013\ntypical hadronic scale, we expect a good convergence of the HQE for B mesons. Moreover, recent studies of D meson lifetimes [69, 70] and charmed baryon lifetimes [70] indicate a convergence of the HQE even in the charm system.\nIn the framework of the HQE, \u0393(Bq) can be split up into the sum of a leading contribution stemming from the decay of the free heavy b-quark, \u0393b, and of a subleading one which is specific to the Bq meson, \u03b4\u0393Bq :\n\u0393(Bq) = \u0393b + \u03b4\u0393Bq . (1.1)\nWe stress that the free quark decay is proportional to the factor \u03930 = G2Fm5b |Vcb|2/(192\u03c03) and hence has a strong dependence on the mass of the decaying quark. Similarly, ratios of\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\n\u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd) \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd)\nShifman, Voloshin, 1986 [71] \u2248 1.1 \u2248 1\nNeubert, Sachrajda, 1996 [72] fixed to 1.02 1\u00b1O(1%)\nGabbiani et al., 2004 [73] 1.06\u00b1 0.02 1.00\u00b1 0.01\nKirk et al., 2017 [74] 1.082+0.022\u22120.026 1.0007\u00b1 0.0025\nTable 2. Selected theoretical determinations of the B-meson lifetimes.\nB-meson lifetimes can be recast, without making any approximations, as:\n\u03c4(Bq) \u03c4(Bq\u2032) = \u0393b + \u03b4\u0393Bq\u2032 \u0393b + \u03b4\u0393Bq\n= 1 + ( \u03b4\u0393Bq\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4\u0393Bq ) \u03c4(Bq) . (1.2)\nIn our analysis we obtain predictions for the lifetime ratios by combining the HQE result for (\u03b4\u0393Bq\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4\u0393Bq) with the experimental value of \u03c4(Bq), given the higher precision of the latter. Note that in this way, the numerically leading term \u0393b cancels out, so that \u03c4(Bq)/\u03c4(Bq\u2032) becomes sensitive only to subleading HQE corrections, while the total decay rate can be used primarily to test our ability to predict the free-quark decay. Alternatively, eq. (1.2) can be determined entirely within the HQE, in this case the dependence on \u0393b is still present albeit very mildly, leading to slightly larger uncertainties.\nIn the presence of physics beyond the SM (BSM), lifetime ratios will be modified as:\n\u03c4(Bq) \u03c4(Bq\u2032) = 1 + ( \u03b4\u0393SMBq\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4\u0393 SM Bq ) \u03c4(Bq)\n+ Br(Bq\u2032 \u2192 X)BSM \u03c4(Bq) \u03c4(Bq\u2032) \u2212 Br(Bq \u2192 Y )BSM, (1.3)\nwhere here, X and Y denote possible BSM particles, into which the Bq\u2032 and Bq meson could respectively decay. For the case of the ratio \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd), a precision of the per mille level \u2014 both in experiments and theory \u2014 will allow indirect new physics searches Bq \u2192 X at the same level of accuracy. However, also a precision of the order of one or two per cent in the theory prediction of \u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd) can give interesting constraints on certain BSM models. Examples of new Bq \u2192 X transitions that can modify the predictions for the B-meson lifetimes are:\n\u2022 BSM contributions to non-leptonic tree-level b-quark decays, like b\u2192 cu\u0304d, b\u2192 cu\u0304s or b\u2192 cc\u0304s transitions, see e.g. refs. [75\u201383].\n\u2022 BSM effects to b\u2192 s\u03c4\u03c4 transitions, see e.g. ref. [84] \u2014 such enhanced contributions could stem from models that explain the b \u2192 s`` anomalies, see e.g. refs. [85\u201387]. Moreover, direct bounds on this channel are very weak [88], and in the range of the experimental precision of the lifetime ratio \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd):\nBr(Bs \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212) < 6.8 \u00b7 10\u22123 (LHCb) . (1.4)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nThe corresponding SM prediction [89] lies far below the current experimental bound:\nBr(Bs \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212)SM = (7.73\u00b1 0.49) \u00b7 10\u22127 . (1.5)\n\u2022 BSM contributions that arise in the baryogenesis models presented in refs. [90, 91] contain new b-quark decay channels that affect the lifetimes.\nWe also point out that a precise determination of \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) and \u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd) can be further used to constrain the possible size of duality violating effects in the theoretical determination of lifetimes, see ref. [92].2 In light of the increasing experimental precision and of the phenomenological potential outlined above, we present an update of the SM prediction for B-meson lifetimes. Specifically, our study includes the following improvements with respect to previous works:\n1. The Wilson coefficient of the Darwin operator. This represents a correction of order 1/m3b to the HQE and only recently the corresponding expressions for non-leptonic b-quark decays have been computed in refs. [93\u201396]. Thus, in the present work we include for the first time the complete dimension-six contribution at LO-QCD. Interestingly, the Darwin operator leads to sizeable effects to the lifetimes and in particular constitutes one of the dominant contributions (or even the dominant one depending on the input for the matrix elements and SU(3)F breaking) to the lifetime ratio \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd).\n2. SU(3)F breaking corrections to the matrix elements of dimension-six four-quark operators as recently computed, within the heavy quark effective theory (HQET) sum rules, in ref. [97]. In fact, previous to the latter work, these matrix elements were only known for the Bd system, as they were determined within HQET sum rules, in ref. [74]. It is worthwhile to stress that so far no lattice determination is available in the literature, the most recent estimates date back to proceedings from 2001 [98], while the corresponding publication has never appeared.\n3. Consistent determination of dimension-seven four-quark operator contributions. In fact, as it has been pointed out in ref. [69], previous studies were incorrectly including the effect of some dimension-seven operators, which was actually already accounted for when converting the HQET decay constant to the QCD one.\n4. The so-called eye-contractions, which have been computed for the first time in ref. [97] with HQET sum rules. In this approach the eye-contractions constitute subleading corrections of order \u03b1s to the matrix element of dimension-six four-quark operators and their numerical effect is found to be small.\n2Any observed tension between SM predictions for B-meson lifetimes and the corresponding experimental determinations could be in principle a signal of BSM physics, of duality violation or of both. In order to disentangle these effects one could perform for example model independent BSM searches within a SMEFT-like framework. If there would be BSM physics affecting the lifetimes through new \u2206B = 1 four-quark operators, then these new operators would also modify e.g. hadronic B-meson decays or other flavour observables. So, finding tensions in the lifetimes but not in other observables could be an indication for duality violation in the HQE.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\n5. Detailed numerical analysis of the total decay rates of the Bd , B+ and Bs mesons.\n6. Update of all relevant SM parameters, in particular the CKM input.\nThe paper is structured as follows: in section 2 we present the main ingredients of the analysis. Specifically, in section 2.1 we outline the general structure of the HQE for the b-system, in section 2.2 we describe the status and the updates for the short-distance contributions, while in section 2.3 we analyse in detail the non-perturbative part of the HQE and the choice of the corresponding input. Our numerical results are discussed in section 3 and we conclude with a summary and an outlook in section 4.

A comparison of the values of the corresponding Wilson coefficients for different choices of the scale \u00b51 and both at LO- and NLO-QCD [99] is shown in the appendix in table 5. The second term in eq. (2.1) describes the contribution to the effective Hamiltonian due to semileptonic b-quark decays, i.e.\nHSLeff = GF\u221a 2 \u2211 q=u,c \u2211 `=e,\u00b5,\u03c4 V \u2217qbQ q` + h.c. , (2.7)\nwith Qq` = ( b\u0304\u0393\u00b5 q ) (\u03bd\u0304` \u0393\u00b5 `) . (2.8)\nFinally, Hrareeff in eq. (2.2) encodes the contribution due to suppressed b-quark transitions which are only relevant for the study of rare decays like B \u2192 K(\u2217)\u03b3 or B \u2192 K`+`\u2212. These modes have very small branching fractions which fall out of the current theoretical sensitivity for the lifetimes.4 Hence, in the following, the effect of Hrareeff is neglected and for brevity we do not show its explicit expression below. The total decay width of a Bq meson, with mass mBq and four-momentum pB reads\n\u0393(Bq) = 1\n2mBq \u2211 X \u222b PS (2\u03c0)4\u03b4(4)(pB \u2212 pX) |\u3008X(pX)|Heff |Bq(pB)\u3009|2, (2.9)\nwhere PS denotes the phase space integration, and the summation over all possible final states X into which the B meson can decay is performed. Using the optical theorem, \u0393(Bq) can be related to the discontinuity of the forward scattering matrix element of the time ordered product of the double insertion of the effective Hamiltonian, i.e.\n\u0393(Bq) = 1\n2mBq Im\u3008Bq|T |Bq\u3009 , (2.10)\nwith the transition operator given by\nT = i \u222b d4xT {Heff(x) ,Heff(0)} . (2.11)\nThe non-local operator in eq. (2.11) can be evaluated by exploiting the fact that the b-quark is heavy i.e. mb \u039bQCD, where the latter defines a typical non-perturbative hadronic scale. In fact, in the framework of the HQE, the b-quark momentum is decomposed as\np\u00b5b = mbv \u00b5 + k\u00b5 , (2.12)\nwith v = pB/mBq denoting the four-velocity of the B-meson, and k representing a residual momentum which accounts for non-perturbative interactions of the b-quark with the light degrees of freedom, i.e. soft gluons and quarks, inside the hadronic state. It thus follows that k \u223c \u039bQCD. Moreover, the heavy b-quark field is parametrised as\nb(x) = e\u2212imbv\u00b7xbv(x) , (2.13) 4E.g. the inclusive radiative decay B \u2192 Xs\u03b3 has branching fractions of the order of 10\u22124, which is\nconsiderably below the current accuracy of our analysis.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\n+b b b b + . . . + + . . .\nb b\nb b b b b b b b b b\nO3 O5 O6 O\u03036 O\u03037\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf1\nf2 q q\nq q qq\nFigure 2.

Note that while the contribution of two-quark operators derives from two-loop diagrams, four-quark operators are generated already at one-loop at LO-QCD. The labels f1,2,3 stand for all the possible fermions the b-quark can decay into.\nby factoring out the large component of its momentum and by introducing a rescaled field bv(x) containing only low oscillation frequencies of the order of k. In fact, this field satisfies\niD\u00b5b(x) = e\u2212imbv\u00b7x(mbv\u00b5 + iD\u00b5)bv(x) , (2.14)\nshowing that the action of the covariant derivative D\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5 \u2212 igsAa\u00b5 ta also leads to a large contribution proportional to the heavy quark mass and to a residual term of the order of \u039bQCD. Moreover, we recall that the rescaled field bv(x) is related to HQET field hv(x), see e.g. ref. [100], by\nbv(x) = hv(x) + i /D\u22a5 2mb\nhv(x) +O (\n1 m2b\n) , (2.15)\nwith D\u00b5\u22a5 = D\u00b5 \u2212 (v \u00b7D) v\u00b5. Taking into account eqs. (2.12)\u2013(2.14), the total decay width in eq. (2.10) can be systematically expanded in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass, leading to the HQE series.

(2.21), a summation over all possible non-leptonic and semileptonic modes of the b-quark is implicitly assumed and we have denoted by CP3,ij with i = 1, 2, and j = 3, . . . , 6, 8, the contribution due to the mixed insertion of the current-current and of the penguin or the chromo-magnetic operators. Remarkably, for semileptonic modes even \u03b13s-corrections have been computed by now [101, 102], however, as the accuracy for non-leptonic modes reaches only NLO-QCD, we perform our analysis consistently at this order and do not include the new results for C3,SL. Moreover, following a common counting adopted in the literature [103, 104], due to the small size of the corresponding Wilson coefficients, the contribution of the penguin and chromo-magnetic operators is in fact treated as a next-to-leading order effect, i.e. CP3,ij = 0, for j = 3, . . . , 6, 8, at LO-QCD. The LO-results for the short distance coefficients in eq. (2.21) can be found e.g. in the appendix of ref. [93]. At NLO-QCD, the analytic expressions for C3,11, C3,22, and C3,SL can be easily extracted from ref. [105], where the computation has been performed for three different final state masses, while those for C3,12 are derived from the results presented in ref. [106] in the case of the b\u2192 cc\u0304s transition, and in ref. [107] for the remaining modes. Finally CP3,ij are taken from ref. [106]. At order 1/m2b , the short-distance coefficients are obtained by computing the discontinuity of two-loop diagrams, as the one in the center of figure 2, and by taking into account\n5Since m2s/m2b \u2248 m2\u00b5/m2b \u223c 0.05%, the effect of non-vanishing s-quark and \u00b5-lepton masses to the short-distance coefficients is far below the current theoretical accuracy and hence can be safely neglected. However, we must include strange quark mass corrections in the non-perturbative input, where these effects are much more pronounced, in order to account for SU(3)F breaking.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nthe expansion of the dimension-three matrix element. The corresponding contribution can be schematically written as\n\u03935 \u3008O5\u3009 m2b = \u03930 [ c\u03c0 \u3008O\u03c0\u3009 m2b + cG \u3008OG\u3009 m2b ] , (2.22)\nwhere the matrix elements of the kinetic and chromo-magnetic operators, see eqs. (2.37), (2.38),6 are discussed in section 2.3. In our analysis, again for consistency, we include the coefficients c\u03c0 and cG only at LO-QCD, since \u03b1s-corrections have so far been determined only for the semileptonic channels [108]. At this order, the contribution of the kinetic operator is equal to the one of dimension-three up to a numerical factor, i.e. c\u03c0 = \u2212c(0)3 /2, while the coefficient cG can be decomposed as\ncG = CG,SL + 3C21 CG,11 + 2C1C2 CG,12 + 3C22 CG,22 , (2.23)\nhere again a summation over all the b-quark modes is assumed. The expressions for the non-leptonic channels CG,ij can be found e.g. in the appendix of ref. [93], however originally computed in refs. [109\u2013111], while the semileptonic coefficient CG,SL is obtained using the general result for two different final state masses presented e.g. in the appendix of ref. [112], and first determined in refs. [113, 114]. At order 1/m3b , both two- and four-quark operators contribute,7 see respectively the second and third diagram on the top line of figure 2. For the former, we can compactly write\n\u03936 \u3008O6\u3009 m3b = \u03930 c\u03c1D \u3008OD\u3009 m3b , (2.24)\nwhere the matrix element of the Darwin operator is defined in eq. (2.39), while the corresponding short-distance coefficient can be decomposed as:\nc\u03c1D = C\u03c1D,SL + 3C21 C\u03c1D,11 + 2C1C2 C\u03c1D,12 + 3C22 C\u03c1D,22 , (2.25)\nsumming again over all b-quark decay modes. Also in this case, the accuracy in our analysis reaches only LO-QCD, as this is the order at which the non-leptonic contributions are known; for the semileptonic decays the coefficient of the Darwin operator has been first computed in ref. [115], while NLO-QCD corrections have been recently determined in refs. [116\u2013118]. The complete expressions of C\u03c1D,ij for all non-leptonic channels have been obtained recently in refs. [93\u201395], while the coefficient C\u03c1D,SL can be read off the general results for the case of two different final state masses presented e.g. in refs. [118, 119]. In this respect, it is worth emphasising that contrary to the naive expectation, the coefficient of the Darwin operator is found to be sizeable; more precisely, it results to be one order of magnitude larger than the corresponding ones at dimension-five. However, as it has been shown in detail\n6Note that with a little abuse of notation, we denote by chromo-magnetic operators both Qq38 and OG. However, as they arise respectively in the \u2206B = 1 and \u2206B = 0 effective theory, it should be clear from the context to which one we actually refer.\n7We stress that, by using the equations of motion for the gluon field strength tensor, the dimension-six operator basis can be also written in terms of four-quark operators only, see section 2.3.\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\ne.g. in ref. [93], this actually follows from an accidental suppression of the dimension-five coefficients, and not from an abnormal enhancement of the Darwin term. Therefore, the contribution of the Darwin operator, neglected in previous phenomenological studies, turns out to be an important ingredient for the theoretical prediction of the B-meson lifetimes, see section 3.\nThe short-distance coefficients due to four-quark operators are obtained by computing, at LO-QCD, the discontinuity of the one-loop diagrams showed in figure 3, corresponding respectively to the weak annihilation (WA), Pauli interference (PI), and weak-exchange (WE) topologies, see e.g. refs. [72, 120] for results including the charm quark mass dependence. Their contribution, at dimension-six, can be schematically written as\n16\u03c02 \u0393\u03036 \u3008O\u03036\u3009 m3b\n= \u03930 [ AWEi,q1q2\n\u3008O\u0303q3i \u3009 m3b +APIi,q1q3 \u3008O\u0303q2i \u3009 m3b + AWAi,q2q3 \u3008O\u0303q1i \u3009 m3b +AWAi,q1` \u3008O\u0303q1i \u3009 m3b\n] , (2.26)\nwhere i = 1, . . . , 4, and a sum over all possible final states, following the notation in eq. (2.2), is implied. Again, we refer to section 2.3 for a discussion of the matrix elements of the corresponding four-quark operators. Moreover, eq. (2.26) shows that, contrary to the corrections described so far, now differences in the contributions to specific Bq-mesons arise not only because of different states in the matrix elements, but also due to different short-distance coefficients. In light of this and of the formal loop enhancement with respect to two-quark operators, the effect of four-quark operators was expected to give the dominant correction to the total widths and in particular to the lifetime ratios, see e.g. refs. [72, 120]. The complete expressions for AWEi,q1q2 and A PI i,q1q3 up to NLO-QCD corrections, and including also the effect of mixed tree-penguin contributions, have been computed in ref. [121] for four-quark operators defined in HQET.8 The results for AWAi,q2q3 can be obtained, by means of a Fierz transformation, from the corresponding ones for AWEi,q1q2 replacing C1 \u2194 C2. For semileptonic modes, the coefficients AWAi,q1` have been determined in ref. [123]. Finally, at order 1/m4b , only the LO-QCD short-distance coefficients of the four-quark operators are known in the literature. They were determined in refs. [73, 124] for operators defined in QCD9 and also in ref. [123] for the HQET ones. The corresponding contribution to the total decay width schematically reads\n16\u03c02 \u0393\u03037 \u3008O\u03037\u3009 m4b\n= \u03930 [ BWEi,q1q2\n\u3008P\u0303 q3i \u3009 m4b +BPIi,q1q3 \u3008P\u0303 q2i \u3009 m4b + BWAi,q2q3 \u3008P\u0303 q1i \u3009 m4b +BWAi,q1` \u3008P\u0303 q1i \u3009 m4b\n] , (2.27)\nwhere i = 1, . . . , 18. We refer to Appedix B for the analytic expressions of the dimensionseven four-quark operator contribution to the WE, PI, and WA topologies in HQET. The dimension-seven four-quark operator basis, together with the relative parametrisation, is briefly discussed in section 2.3, while more details can be found in ref. [69].\n8For the case of QCD operators see refs. [121, 122]. 9We note that while comparing our results with the ones presented in refs. [73, 124], we have actually\nfound some inconsistencies in their expressions and communicated this to the authors.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4"

            "text": "In this section we discuss the status and the choice of the non-perturbative input needed in our analysis. These parametrise the matrix elements of the \u2206B = 0 operators in the HQE, and hence encode the contribution to the total decay width due to hadronic effects. For clarity of the presentation, it is convenient to start with the four-quark operators. At order 1/m3b in the HQE, we consider the following operator basis, already defined in terms of the HQET field hv(x) = bv(x) +O(1/mb):\nO\u0303q1 = ( h\u0304v \u03b3\u00b5 (1\u2212 \u03b35) q ) (q\u0304 \u03b3\u00b5 (1\u2212 \u03b35)hv) , (2.28)\nO\u0303q2 = ( h\u0304v (1\u2212 \u03b35) q ) (q\u0304 (1 + \u03b35)hv) , (2.29)\nO\u0303q3 = ( h\u0304v \u03b3\u00b5 (1\u2212 \u03b35) taq ) (q\u0304 \u03b3\u00b5 (1\u2212 \u03b35) tahv) , (2.30)\nO\u0303q4 = ( h\u0304v (1\u2212 \u03b35) taq ) (q\u0304 (1 + \u03b35) tahv) . (2.31)\nThe matrix elements of the operators in eqs. (2.28)\u2013(2.31) are parameterised as [97]\n\u3008Bq|O\u0303qi |Bq\u3009 = F 2q (\u00b50)mBq B\u0303 q i (\u00b50) , (2.32)\n\u3008Bq|O\u0303q \u2032 i |Bq\u3009 = F 2q (\u00b50)mBq \u03b4\u0303 q\u2032q i (\u00b50) , q 6= q\u2032 , (2.33)\nwhere B\u0303qi (\u00b50),10 and \u03b4\u0303 q\u2032q i (\u00b50), i = 1, . . . 4, denote, respectively, the Bag parameters and the so-called eye-contractions, evaluated at the renormalisation \u00b50. We emphasise that the eye-contractions correspond to subleading effects of order \u03b1s to the matrix elements, originating from diagrams in which the spectator quark in the B meson and the light quark in the effective operator do not coincide.11 Moreover, Fq(\u00b50) in eqs. (2.32)\u2013(2.33) labels the HQET decay constant; this is related to the QCD decay constant fBq , at one-loop accuracy and up to power corrections, by [125, 126]\nfBq = Fq(\u00b50)\u221a mBq [ 1 + \u03b1s(\u00b50)2\u03c0 ( ln ( m2b \u00b520 ) \u2212 43 ) +O ( 1 mb )] . (2.34)\nIn vacuum insertion approximation (VIA), the Bag parameters of the colour-singlet operators are equal to one, while those of the colour-octet operators and all the eye-contractions\n10Note that in the literature O\u0303q3,4 are sometimes denoted by T\u0303 q 1,2, and correspondingly B\u0303 q 3,4 by q 1,2. 11The eye-contractions with q = q\u2032 are in fact included in the Bag parameters B\u0303qi .\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nvanish: B\u0303q1,2 VIA= 1 , B\u0303q3,4 VIA= 0 , \u03b4\u0303q \u2032q i VIA= 0 . (2.35)\nThe deviation of the non-perturbative input B\u0303qi (\u00b50) and \u03b4\u0303 q\u2032q i (\u00b50) from their VIA values has been computed within the framework of HQET sum rules. Specifically, the Bag parameters B\u0303qi were firstly determined in ref. [74] for the case of the B+,0 mesons, while corrections due to the strange quark mass as well as the contribution of the eye-contractions have been obtained in ref. [97]. Their numerical values are listed in table 7. Note that throughout this work we assume isospin symmetry, i.e.\nB\u0303ui = B\u0303di , \u03b4\u0303usi = \u03b4\u0303dsi , \u03b4\u0303sui = \u03b4\u0303sdi , \u03b4\u0303udi = \u03b4\u0303dui . (2.36)\nAt order 1/m4b , the HQET operator basis is much larger. Specifically, it includes 18 operators of which 10 local and 8 non-local, which are generated from the expansion of the heavy quark field and of the HQET Lagrangian, see e.g. ref. [100]. Their complete expressions, together with the parametrisation of their matrix elements can be found in ref. [69]. Here we limit ourselves to stress that the effect of all non-local operators and of some local ones is actually absorbed in the conversion of the HQET decay constant, cf. eq. (2.34), when also 1/mb corrections are taken into account.12 This has been overlooked in previous analyses [123] and only recently clarified in ref. [69]. In appendix B, we present the analytic expression for the dimension-seven contribution to the PI, WE and WA topologies in VIA. Note that so far, there is no computation of the dimension-seven Bag parameters available in the literature. We now turn to discuss the input needed to parametrise the matrix elements of two-quark operators. Up to order 1/m3b in the HQE, the basis includes the kinetic and chromo-magnetic operators at dimension-five and the Darwin operator at dimension-six.13 Namely\n2mB \u00b52\u03c0(Bq) = \u2212\u3008Bq|b\u0304v(iD\u00b5)(iD\u00b5)bv|Bq\u3009 , (2.37)\n2mB \u00b52G(Bq) = \u3008Bq|b\u0304v(iD\u00b5)(iD\u03bd)(\u2212i\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd)bv|Bq\u3009 , (2.38)\n2mB \u03c13D(Bq) = \u3008Bq|b\u0304v(iD\u00b5)(iv \u00b7D)(iD\u00b5)bv|Bq\u3009 . (2.39)\nNote that following ref. [128], the operators in eqs. (2.37)\u2013(2.39) are defined in terms of bv(x) and not the HQET field hv(x). Nevertheless, as we have explicitly checked, any differences between these two choices arise only at order 1/m4b . The values of the non-perturbative parameters \u00b52\u03c0, \u00b52G, and \u03c13D for the case of the B+,0 meson can be determined from fits to the experimental data on inclusive semileptonic B \u2192 Xc `\u03bd\u0304` decays. Analyses using moments of the lepton energy and of the invariant hadronic mass distributions were carried\n12We stress that in principle the running of the dimension-seven HQET operators should also be taken into account and would lead to a residual effect not included in the QCD decay constant. A detailed study, performed in ref. [127] for the case of B \u2212 B\u0304 mixing, has found this effect to be small i.e. \u223c 5% for running of \u00b50 from the scale mb to 1 GeV. Since we consider \u00b50 \u223c mb and do not run to low scales \u223c 1 GeV, we expect even a much smaller effect to the lifetimes and thus we neglect it in our analysis.\n13We stress that at dimension-six the basis formally includes also the spin-orbit operator OLS. However, by adopting definitions in terms of full covariant derivatives (and not the transversal ones), the contribution of OLS to the total decay width vanishes, for detail see e.g. ref. [128].\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nout in refs. [129, 130], and recently in ref. [131], where also the new N3LO-QCD results for the parton level decay [101, 102] were included. Very recently a new fit [132] has been performed using data on the moments of the dilepton invariant mass distribution reported by the Belle and Belle-II collaborations [133, 134]. Both analyses [131, 132] yield similar results for Vcb, the kinetic mass mkinb (1 GeV) and the parameters \u00b52\u03c0(B), \u00b52G(B). However, there appears to be a significant difference for the value of \u03c13D(B), see table 6. Interestingly, it turns out that the Darwin operator, which was neglected in all previous analyses of \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd), see e.g. refs. [72, 74], actually yields a large or even dominant contribution to this ratio. As the origin of the discrepancy in the numerical value of \u03c13D(B) is not yet understood, we consider two scenarios for the choice of the parameters mkinb , \u00b52\u03c0(B), \u00b52G(B), and \u03c13D(B), as it is summarised in table 6 of the appendix. Specifically, we refer to scenario A when using the input from ref. [131], and to scenario B when using those of ref. [132]. It is worthwhile to point out that an alternative way to determine \u03c13D makes use of the equations of motion (EOM) for the gluon field strength tensor. In fact, taking into account that\nD\u00b5Ga\u00b5\u03c1 = \u2212gs \u2211 q (q\u0304\u03b3\u03c1taq), [iD\u00b5, [iD\u03c1, iD\u00b5]] = gsD\u00b5G\u00b5\u03c1 , (2.40)\nthe matrix element of the Darwin operator can be written up to 1/mb corrections, as\n\u2212 4mB \u03c13D(Bq) = g2s\u3008Bq|OP |Bq\u3009+O ( 1 mb ) . (2.41)\nIn eq. (2.41), we have introduced the penguin operator\nOP = (h\u0304v\u03b3\u00b5tahv) \u2211 q (q\u0304\u03b3\u00b5taq) , (2.42)\nwhose matrix element can be parametrised as [97]14\n\u3008Bq|OP |Bq\u3009 = \u2212 2 9f 2 Bqm 2 B B\u0303qP + \u2211 q\u2032 6=q \u03b4\u0303q \u2032q P  . (2.43) Again, the input B\u0303qP and \u03b4\u0303 q\u2032q P in eq. (2.43) denote the corresponding Bag parameters and the eye-contractions also determined for the first time in ref. [97] within the framework of HQET sum rules. Note that in VIA, eqs. (2.41), (2.43) lead to the following simplified expression for the Darwin parameter up to power corrections, i.e.\n\u03c13D(Bq) \u2248 g2s 18f 2 Bq mBq . (2.44)\n14Note that by means of Fierz transformations, the matrix element of the penguin operator can be recast in terms of a liner combination of the four-quark operators given in eqs. (2.28)\u2013(2.31), together with the corresponding ones obtained by replacing (1 \u2212 \u03b35) \u2192 (1 + \u03b35). Taking into account parity conservation in QCD and the parametrisation in eqs. (2.32)\u2013(2.33) leads to an expression analogous to eq. (2.43) and numerically consistent with it.\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nA comparison of the values of \u03c13D obtained for different choices of the renormalisation scale at which the strong coupling is evaluated, and using both the HQET sum rules and the VIA results for the non-perturbative input in eq. (2.43), is shown in table 3. In this respect, two comments are in order. First, HQET sum rules and VIA yield very similar results for \u03c13D. Second, it is interesting to observe that setting \u00b5 \u223c mb, leads to a value for \u03c13D in very good agreement with the one obtained by the fit of ref. [132], whereas the result given in ref. [131] is reproduced by setting \u03b1s \u223c 1, i.e. choosing a very low renormalisation scale. In order to predict \u0393(Bs) and \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd), we also need to fix the size of the largely unknown SU(3)F breaking effects in the non-perturbative parameters discussed above. A possible estimate for the value of \u00b52G(B(s)) can be obtained using the spectroscopy relation [135]\n\u00b52G(B(s)) \u2248 3 4 ( M2B\u2217(s) \u2212M2B(s) ) , (2.45)\nwhich yields \u00b52G(Bs) \u00b52G(B) ' M2B\u2217s \u2212M 2 Bs M2B\u2217 \u2212M2B ' 1.09\u00b1 0.05 . (2.46) In eq. (2.46), the values of the mesons masses are taken from ref. [136] and lead to a vanishing uncertainty. Therefore we have assigned a conservative 50% uncertainty to the deviation from one in order to account for missing power corrections. Recently, the size of the SU(3)F breaking in \u00b52G has been estimated using lattice QCD in refs. [137, 138], indicating larger effects [139]\n\u00b52G(Bs) \u00b52G(B) ' 1.20\u00b1 0.10 , (2.47)\nhowever in agreement with eq. (2.46) within uncertainties. In the case of the kinetic operator, \u00b52\u03c0 can be determined using the spin-averaged masses, see e.g. ref. [140], leading to [139, 140]\n\u00b52\u03c0(Bs)\u2212 \u00b52\u03c0(B) \u2248 (0.04\u00b1 0.02) GeV2 , (2.48)\nvalid up to power corrections, which are \"accounted\" by adding again a conservative 50% uncertainty in eq. (2.48). On the other side, recent lattice QCD estimates [138] again predict somehow larger SU(3)F breaking effects,\n\u00b52\u03c0(Bs)\u2212 \u00b52\u03c0(B) \u2248 (0.11\u00b1 0.03) GeV2 . (2.49)\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nFinally, the size of the SU(3)F breaking effects in \u03c13D can be estimated using the EOM relation in eq. (2.44), yielding\n\u03c13D(Bs) \u03c13D(B) \u2248 f2BsmBs f2BmB \u2248 1.49\u00b1 0.25, (2.50)\nwhere we have used lattice results for the decay constants [141], see table 6, and have again assigned additional conservative 50% uncertainty to the deviation from one due to missing power corrections. As one can see, eq. (2.50) predicts very large \u2248 50 % SU(3)F breaking in \u03c13D. An alternative way to estimate \u03c13D(Bs)/\u03c13D(B) is based on the sum rules in the heavy quark limit, see e.g. ref. [140], which leads to\n\u03c13D(Bs) \u03c13D(B) ' ( \u00b52\u03c0(Bs) \u00b52\u03c0(B) )2 \u039b\u0304 \u039b\u0304s \u2248  1.05\u00b1 0.09 using Eq. (2.48) , 1.35\u00b1 0.16 using eq. (2.49) , , (2.51)\nwith \u039b\u0304(s) = mB(s) \u2212mb, and we have used for \u00b52\u03c0(B) the value from ref. [138], as it is more precise than the one from ref. [132], cf. table 6. Note that eq. (2.51) is very sensitive to the SU(3)F breaking in \u00b52\u03c0, and using the estimate in eq. (2.48) yields a much smaller value for \u03c13D(Bs)/\u03c13D(B) than the result in eq. (2.50). As we see from the discussion above, the estimates of the SU(3)F breaking in the matrix elements of the two-quark operators differ quite sizeably depending on the method used. These differences will strongly affect the lifetime ratio \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd). Taking into account also the two fits [131, 132], in our analysis we therefore consider the following two scenarios, to cover both extreme cases for \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd):\n\u2022 Scenario A: Non-perturbative parameters from fit by ref. [131] (with large value of \u03c13D) and larger SU(3)F breaking effects by using eqs. (2.47), (2.49) and (2.50).\n\u2022 Scenario B: Non-perturbative parameters from fit by ref. [132] (with small value of \u03c13D) and smaller SU(3)F breaking effects by eqs. (2.46), (2.48) and the first line of (2.51).\nA future, more precise determination of these non-perturbative parameters and of the corresponding size of SU(3)F breaking \u2014 either by fits of inclusive semileptonic B and Bs decays or by non-perturbative calculations \u2014 is clearly necessary to obtain more insights on the theoretical prediction of \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd). All the values used in our analysis for the non-perturbative parameters, in correspondence of these two scenarios, are summarised in table 6."

As we can see, the dominant contribution to eqs. (3.3)\u2013(3.5) is given by the total width of the b-quark,\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4 while power and radiative corrections appear to be under control and are of order of few percents. For the leading term \u03933, as it has already been mentioned above, even N3LO-QCD corrections to semileptonic decays are known; in the scheme mkinb (1 GeV) and mc(2 GeV), the authors of ref. [101] find respectively \u22128.7% at NLO, \u22121.8% at NNLO and \u22120.03% at N3LO, meaning that higher order effects are negative and very small. NLO-QCD corrections to \u03933 in the total width amount to \u223c \u22127.4%, but for the actual size of higher order effects the complete computation of \u03b12s-corrections due to non-leptonic b-quark decays is needed. Looking at the effect of the two-quark operators, it might come as surprising that the coefficient of \u03c13D is about one order of magnitude larger than those in front of \u00b52\u03c0 and \u00b52G. However, this follows from an accidental suppression of the dimension-five contribution, more than from an enhancement of the Darwin term, hence we do not expect problems with the convergence of the HQE when including higher power corrections. The series, in the case of inclusive semileptonic B-decays, where 1/m4b corrections to two-quark operators are known, is in fact well-behaving, see e.g. the discussion in ref. [93]. For semileptonic modes also NLO-corrections are known and these amount approximately at \u223c \u2212(5 \u2212 8)% and \u223c (3\u2212 7)% for the \u00b52G and \u03c13D contributions, respectively [117, 118]. Assuming the absence of unexpected enhancements at higher orders, in our study we conservatively add extra 15% uncertainty to the dimension-six contribution in order to account for missing 1/m4b and \u03b1s-corrections. Concerning the effect of four-quark operators, we find, as expected, that the most sizeable shift derives from the PI topology, which constitutes the dominant contribution to the total width of the B+ meson, whereas it enters \u0393(Bd) and \u0393(Bs) only through the eye-contractions. On the other side, the WE diagrams, which represent the dominant topologies for the Bd and Bs mesons, are affected by helicity suppression at LO-QCD and lead only to a small contribution. Furthermore, we see that while the operators O\u0303q3 and O\u0303 q 4\nhave generally the largest coefficients, the corresponding Bag parameters are very small, not more than few percents in magnitude, and they completely vanish in VIA. On the contrary, the operators O\u0303q1 and O\u0303 q 2 have smaller coefficients but larger Bag parameters of the order of one. Regarding the size of the NLO-QCD corrections to spectator effects, they turn out to be very sizeable, particularly in the case of \u0393(B+), therefore the computation of higher order corrections is of great relevance and should be addressed in the future. On the other side, the contribution of the eye-contractions is generally found to be negligible, if one uses the HQET sum rule predictions for the corresponding matrix elements, see ref. [97]. Dimension-seven corrections are also relatively small in \u0393(B+), where they are dominated by the PI topology, and almost negligible for the total width of the Bd and Bs mesons, again because of the helicity suppression in WE. Finally, along the same line as for the two-quark operator contribution, also in this case we add extra 15% uncertainty to the dimension-seven correction in order to account for missing higher order terms.\nThe theoretical predictions for the lifetime ratios are obtained from eq. (1.2) using as input the experimental value for \u03c4(B+) and \u03c4(Bs) in order to cancel the dependence on the dimension-three contribution.

(3.7)\nFrom eq. (3.6) and taking into account the values of the Bag parameters, we see that the dominant correction to \u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd) is given by the operators O\u0303u1 and O\u0303u3 because of the large PI contribution in \u0393(B+), whereas the effect of the remaining non-perturbative input is much smaller. Therefore, in order to improve the theoretical prediction for \u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd), both the computation of NNLO corrections to the four-quark operators and a more precise determination of the corresponding Bag parameters would be highly desirable. For the ratio \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd), the situation is less trivial. The theoretical prediction for this observable is entirely driven by the size of the SU(3)F breaking effects in the non-perturbative matrix elements of the Bs and Bd mesons. For both of them the dominant contribution from the four-quark operators originates from the WE topology. However, the latter is extremely suppressed, because of, on one side, the specific combination of the corresponding \u2206B = 1 Wilson coefficients, and, on the other side, the helicity suppression affecting these diagrams. In light of this, the role of two-quark operators becomes crucial. Depending on the numerical input values we are using for \u00b52\u03c0, \u00b52G and \u03c13D, the dimension-five two-quark operators can give contributions of up to several per mille to \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd), while the Darwin operator can even contribute with up to two per cent, a result absolutely unexpected a priori. When varying all the input parameters within their uncertainties, as listed in appendix A, we obtain the results shown in table 4 and figure 4. In addition, to demonstrate the size of the individual contribution of different parameters to the error budget for the decay widths and lifetime ratios, we show the corresponding pie charts in figure 5. We find that the main source of uncertainty to the decay widths comes from the variation of the scale \u00b51, and that \u201csubdominant\u201d contributions are due to the b- and c-quark masses and |Vcb|2. In the case of the lifetime ratio \u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd) the error budget is dominated by the value of the Bag parameters and by the variation of the scale \u00b50. In this regard, as already stressed above, an independent computation by lattice QCD of the matrix elements of the dimension-six four-quark operators and the complete determination of the NNLO-QCD corrections to the corresponding coefficients might be very helpful in reducing the relative uncertainty. The lifetime ratio \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) is very sensitive to the parameter \u03c13D(B), because of its large coefficient, and to the size of the SU(3)F breaking effects in all the non-perturbative input. Unfortunately the numerical values of these non-perturbative matrix elements are currently badly known. Therefore we consider two different scenarios for the parameters mkinb (1GeV), \u00b52\u03c0, \u00b52G, and \u03c13D and we observe that both sets of input yield very similar results for all observables, except for \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd).\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nObservable HQE Scenario A HQE Scenario B Exp. value\n\u0393(B+)[ps\u22121] 0.563+0.106\u22120.065 0.576+0.107\u22120.067 0.6105\u00b1 0.0015\n\u0393(Bd)[ps\u22121] 0.615+0.108\u22120.069 0.627+0.110\u22120.070 0.6583\u00b1 0.0017\n\u0393(Bs)[ps\u22121] 0.597+0.109\u22120.069 0.625+0.110\u22120.071 0.6596\u00b1 0.0026\n\u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd) 1.0855+0.0232\u22120.0219 1.0851+0.0230\u22120.0217 1.076\u00b1 0.004\n\u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) 1.0279+0.0113\u22120.0113 1.0032+0.0063\u22120.0063 0.998\u00b1 0.005\nTable 4.

Among the decay widths, here we display only \u0393(B+), since the pie charts for \u0393(Bd) and \u0393(Bs) are very similar with even smaller effects due to the Bag parameters. There are also no visible differences between scenarios A and B for the decay widths. For \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) we show the error budget in both the scenarios A and B, while for \u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd) we present only the scenario A, since the scenario B yields almost the same picture.\nWithin uncertainties all our predictions are found to be in perfect agreement with the corresponding experimental data, again, with the exception of \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd), where it appears to be some tension within Scenario A. Finally, we have explicitly checked that computing the lifetime ratios entirely within the HQE, i.e. without using the experimental values for \u03c4(B+) and \u03c4(Bs) as input, leads to very similar results as the ones stated in table 4 and in figure 4, although with slightly larger uncertainties."

            "text": "With the present work, we have updated the SM prediction, within the framework of the HQE, for the decay width of the B+, Bd, and Bs mesons, together with the lifetime ratios \u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd) and \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd). Compared to the previous study [74], we have, in addition, included the contribution of the Darwin operator, which is sizeable and crucially affects the ratio \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd), corrections to the Bag parameters due to the strange quark mass, eye-contractions, and the consistent dimension-seven four-quark operator contribution in HQET.\nTo our best knowledge, we perform the first comprehensive study of the total decay rates of the Bd, B+ and Bs mesons. Our theory predictions for the latter agree well with\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nexperiment, albeit with large uncertainties, see table 4. From a phenomenological point of view, this implies that huge BSM contributions of the order of 10% to the total decay rate can currently not be excluded by these observables. For the ratio \u03c4(B+)/\u03c4(Bd), our prediction is in a very good agreement with the experimental value. Compared to the experimental relative precision of 4 per mille, we find a theory uncertainty of around 2 per cent. In the case of \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd), the situation is, however, more complicated. This ratio is extremely sensitive to the value of \u03c13D(B) and to the size of SU(3)F breaking in the parameter \u00b52\u03c0(B), \u00b52G(B) and \u03c13D(B). Unfortunately, neither of these non-perturbative inputs are currently well known. Specifically, we find excellent agreement of \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) with the data when using the fit results for \u00b52\u03c0(B), \u00b52G(B) and \u03c13D(B) from ref. [132] and estimates of SU(3)F breaking from spectroscopy relations. In that case, we also find both the experimental and theoretical precision to be of the order of 6 per mille. However, if we use the fit results for \u00b52\u03c0(B), \u00b52G(B) and \u03c13D(B) from ref. [131] and the SU(3)F breaking from lattice QCD and from EOM relation for \u03c13D, our theory prediction for \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) lies above the experimental value, and we find also a theoretical uncertainty almost twice as large as the experimental one. Leaving this issue with \u03c13D aside for the moment, we nevertheless come to the conclusion that the HQE works very well for decays of the lightest B-mesons, and thus provides an additional opportunity for accurate tests of the Standard Model and for constraining the parameter space of certain BSM models. In order to pursue both these goals, several possible improvements to the theoretical prediction of B-meson lifetimes and their ratios would very desirable in the future. Specifically:\n\u2022 Clarification of the difference in the numerical value of \u03c13D(B) obtained in the fits performed in ref. [131] and ref. [132]. In this respect, it would probably be worthwhile to perform a combined fit using all sets of experimental data on semileptonic B-meson decays available in the literature.\n\u2022 Extraction of the matrix elements of the kinetic, the chromo-magnetic and the Darwin operators for the Bs meson from a fit to future experimental data on inclusive semileptonic Bs decays. This will allow for a more robust determination of the size of the SU(3)F breaking effects in the corresponding non-perturbative parameters. In parallel, more precise non-perturbative studies of these parameters either with lattice QCD or with sum rules would be very desirable.\n\u2022 Computation of dimension-seven two-quark operator contribution to non-leptonic bquark decays, \u0393(0)7 , as well as radiative \u03b1s-corrections to the dimension-five and dimension-six contribution from non-leptonic decays, i.e. \u0393(1)5 and \u0393 (1) 6 . These\nmight in fact provide very important corrections for the theoretical determination of \u03c4(Bs)/\u03c4(Bd) in the light of crucial role played by the Darwin operator, as discussed in section 3.\n\u2022 Computation of \u03b12s-corrections to the non-leptonic decays of the free b-quark, \u0393 (2) 3 . In\nparticular, this will lead to a reduction of the theory uncertainty in the total decay\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 4\nwidths due to the renormalisation scale variation. A first step in that direction has been done in ref. [145], while the NNLO-QCD corrections to the \u2206B = 1 Wilson coefficients have been determined in ref. [146].\n\u2022 Computation of \u03b12s-corrections to the coefficient of the dimension-six four-quark operators, \u0393\u0303(2)6 . This may considerably improve the theoretical predictions for the lifetime ratios, since the corresponding NLO-QCD corrections have been found to be quite sizeable.\n\u2022 Computation of \u03b1s-corrections to the coefficient of the dimension-seven four-quark operators, \u0393\u0303(1)7 . In fact, the additional gluon contribution will lift the helicity suppression affecting the WE and WA diagrams.\n\u2022 First lattice determination of the matrix elements of the dimension-six four-quark operators, in order to have a cross-check of the corresponding HQET sum rules results, and in particular of the small size of eye-contractions.\n\u2022 First non-perturbative determination of the matrix elements of the dimension-seven four-quark operators. In fact, possible sizeable deviations from VIA in the corresponding Bag parameters may lift the helicity suppression affecting the WE and WA diagrams already at LO-QCD."
