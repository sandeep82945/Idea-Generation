    "abstractText": "The development of 18F-fluorotetrazines, suitable for the radiolabeling of biologics such as proteins and antibodies by IEDDA ligation, represents a major challenge, especially for pretargeting applications. The hydrophilicity of the tetrazine has clearly become a crucial parameter for the performance of in vivo chemistry. In this study, we present the design, the synthesis, the radiosynthesis, the physicochemical characterization, the in vitro and in vivo stability, as well as the pharmacokinetics and the biodistribution determined by PET imaging in healthy animals of an original hydrophilic 18F-fluorosulfotetrazine. This tetrazine was prepared and radiolabelled with fluorine-18 according to a three-step procedure, starting from propargylic butanesultone as the precursor. The propargylic sultone was converted into the corresponding propargylic fluorosulfonate by a ring-opening reaction with 18/19F-fluoride. Propargylic 18/19F-fluorosulfonate was then subject to a CuACC reaction with an azidotetrazine, followed by oxidation. The overall automated radiosynthesis afforded the 18F-fluorosulfotetrazine in 29\u201335% DCY, within 90\u201395 min. The experimental LogP and LogD7.4 values of \u22121.27 \u00b1 0.02 and \u22121.70 \u00b1 0.02, respectively, confirmed the hydrophilicity of the 18F-fluorosulfotetrazine. In vitro and in vivo studies displayed a total stability of the 18Ffluorosulfotetrazine without any traces of metabolization, the absence of non-specific retention in all organs, and the appropriate pharmacokinetics for pre-targeting applications.",

            "text": "1,2,4,5-Tetrazines have found applications in many fields, especially in the bioconjugation and radiolabeling of bio-active vectors for imaging and therapy [1\u20137]. They are essential reagents for bioorthogonal approaches via the inverse electron demand Diels\u2013 Alder (IEDDA) reaction with a dienophile, such as trans-cyclooctene (TCO). The IEDDA reaction, which leads to inert dinitrogen as the sole by-product, has the advantage of having fast kinetics (102\u2013106 M-1s-1) and biocompatibility, making this reaction suitable for the functionalization of biologics. It has become the method of choice for the development of imaging and theranostic agents that are based on proteins and antibodies. The IEDDA reaction also represents one of the most popular reactions for pre-targeting strategies, allowing for the use of short-half-life radioisotopes such as fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 109.8 min) for the in vivo radiolabelling of antibodies with long pharmacokinetics [6]. Fluorine-18 is very attractive due to its ideal physical properties for imaging (E\u03b3+ = 0.63 MeV, \u03b3+ range in a tissue < 2.4 mm). Thus, numerous 18F-tetrazines, obtained by aliphatic or (hetero)aromatic radiofluorination, or by fluorine-heteroatome (Al, B, S, Si) bond formation, have been reported in recent years [8\u201322]. However, the success of pre-targeting strategies is still limited. One of the main reasons for this is the in vivo behavior of the 18F-terazines, including non-specific retention and radiometabolization. Lastly, Herth and co-workers clearly demonstrated that\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 636. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16050636 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 636 2 of 15\nhydrophilicity was a crucial parameter for the performance of the 18F-tetrazines in in vivo chemistry [11]. For two tetrazines that displayed the same rate constant in the reaction with TCO, the best results in pre-targeting were obtained with the most hydrophilic tetrazine. Currently, the hydrophilicity of 18F-tetrazines, evaluated using in silico calculation of the partition coefficient at physiological pH (clogD7.4), was brought by PEG chains [11,17], sugars moieties [9,10], or iminodiacetic acid groups [13,14,16]. Another well-established strategy to enhance the hydrophilic character of organic molecules is to introduce a sulfonic acid function [23]. We previously reported that 18F-fluorosulfonic acid salts were easily obtained by the direct radiofluorination of sultone precursors (Figure 1A) [24]. This ring-opening reaction approach has the advantage of smooth reaction conditions and ease of separation of the polar hydrophilic 18F-sulfonic product from the apolar hydrophobic sultone precursor. Consequently, based on this sultone radiofluorination methodology, we designed the [18F]fluorosulfotetrazines I as a new class of IEDDA partners (Figure 1B). This class of tetrazines also contains a triazole ring that is known to be stable in vivo, and facilitates aqueous solubility [25]. In this study, we report the synthesis and radiosynthesis of the lead fluorosulfotetrazine 1 for proof-of-concept, as well as its characterization including hydrophilicity, in vitro and in vivo stability, and pharmacokinetics via PET imaging.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 17\nof the 18F-terazines, including non-specific retention and radiometabolization.

According to this strategy, the retrosynthetic approach rapidly led to propargylic butanesultone 3 and azidotetrazine 7 as key intermediates (Scheme 1). Propargylic butanesultone 3 was obtained with a 40% yield by the alkylation of commercially available butanesultone 2 with propargyl bromide, after deprotonation with nBuLi in THF at \u221278 \u00b0C.

In parallel, 4-(bromomethyl)benzonitrile 5 was treated with sodium azide and potassium iodide in acetone at room temperature for 24 h to afford 4-(azidomethyl)benzonitrile 6, at a 97% yield.

After oxidation with sodium nitrite and formic acid in a water/ethanol mixture, the azidotetrazine 7 was isolated with a 48% yield.

Development of the Radiosynthesis of [18F]fluorosulfotetrazine [18F]1 The radiosynthesis of [18F]1 was first performed manually, using a low amount of starting radioactivity (<185 MBq, 5 mCi). The most attractive strategy to obtain [18F]1 was the one-step approach via radiofluorination of the tetrazinesultone 8 (Scheme 3A). We initially attempted to convert the tetrazinesultone 8 into [18F]fluorosulfotetrazine [18F]1 under standard conditions using the K18F/K222/K2CO3 complex in ACN, DMF, or DMSO. However, despite our efforts to adapt the amount of K2CO3 (0.5\u201310 mg), K222 (10\u201325 mg), temperature (50\u2013130 \u00b0C), and reaction time (10\u201330 min), the radiochemical yields remained below 5%. The replacement of K18F by Cs18F or TBA18F did not improve the conversions. The optimum radiochemical yields reached only 7%, using the \u201cnon-basic\u201d [18F]fluoride purification method with potassium triflate (10 mg) and K2CO3 (0.5 mg) [12]. These results were in accordance with the well-admitted difficulty of aliphatic radiofluorination from tetrazine substates [13]. Therefore, we decided to adopt a multistep strategy, starting with the radiofluorination of propargylic sultone 3 (Scheme 3B). The radiofluorination of propargylsultone 3 was carried out with K18F/K222/K2CO3 in acetonitrile at 110 \u00b0C for 15 min, in 90\u201396% conversion (n = 8, see Supplementary Materials for TLC and HPLC characterizations). The resulting propargylic [18F]fluorosulfonate [18F]4 was isolated by SPE using a Sep-Pak\u00ae Light QMA, and recovered in acetone at >95%. After elimination of the solvent by distillation under a nitrogen flow, the [18F]4 was treated with azidotetrazine 7, Cu(OAc)2 and Na L-Asc in a 7:3 acetone/water mixture at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min, then with NaNO2 and formic acid at 20 \u00b0C for 5 min.

Automated Radiosynthesis of [18F]Fluorosulfotetrazine [18F]1\nThe overall multistep radiosynthesis of [18F]1 was transposed on the GE TRACERlab FX NPro module. The reaction conditions (masses of precursors and reagents, solvents, reaction times, and temperatures) used in the manual process were globally retained, but adaptations for intermediate purification were required (Figure 2). [18F]Fluoride was recovered from the cyclotron, trapped on an anion exchange resin QMA cartridge ( 1 ) and eluted to reactor 1 using a solution of K2CO3 and K222 in acetonitrile and water ( 2 ). The K [18F]F/K222/K2CO3 complex formed was dried by azeotropic distillation before addition of the sultone precursor 3 in acetonitrile ( 3 ). Radiofluorination was carried out at 105 \u25e6C for 15 min, and then acetonitrile was removed under reduced pressure and replaced by acetone ( 4 and 6 ). The resulting propargylic [18F]fluorosulfonate [18F]4 in acetone was passed onto a Sep-Pak\u00ae Light QMA ( 5 ). The eluate containing [18F]4 was recovered in reactor 2 and concentrated under reduced pressure, in order to recover about 350 \u00b5L of solution. In parallel, Na L-Asc solution ( 7 ) was added to the aqueous copper acetate solution ( 8 ). The resulting mixture was stirred with a helium flow for 20 s, then introduced into the reactor 2. The azidotetrazine 7 in acetone ( 9 ) was then transferred into reactor 2, and the CuAAC reaction was performed at 60 \u25e6C for 25 min. The CuAAC reaction was followed by the oxidation step at 25\u201330 \u25e6C for 5 min, after subsequent addition of sodium nitrite in water ( 10 ) and formic acid ( 11 ). The resulting final mixture was transferred into the large volume vial ( 13 ) for dilution through the addition of water ( 12 ). The dilute crude mixture was passed through a pre-conditioned Sep-Pak\u00ae tC18 Plus Long Environmental ( 14 ). After washing with water ( 15 ), the product was eluted with EtOH ( 16 ), and the ethanolic fraction was diluted in phosphate buffer ( 17 ) before injection into a semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC for purification. Both UV and \u03b3 detection were monitored, and a 72/28 mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 2.1)/ethanol was used as the eluent. [18F]1 was collected into the\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 636 5 of 15\nHPLC flask containing physiological serum and sodium bicarbonate ( 18 ), in order to obtain a pH range of 6.8\u20137.1 and a maximum 9\u20139.5% ethanol concentration. Finally, [18F]1 was directly obtained in the formulation solution ready for injection.

Figure 5 shows fast perfusion in blood circulation over 2 min, and fast elimination of [18F]1 with only 32% of radioactivity (decay corrected) remaining at 60 min. Five minutes post-injection, a high kidney uptake was observed, which reached a plateau after 10\u201320 min, and drastically decreased from 30 to 60 min. To a lesser extent, an elevated liver uptake was also visible at 5 min, which decreased steadily throughout the 60 min dynamic image acquisition. The time-activity curves indicated that [18F]1 was eliminated quickly, mainly through both urinary and biliary routes (29% and 39%, respectively, at 60 min). The elimination route of [18F]1 via the renal pathway confirmed its hydrophilic character. However, accumulation in the liver suggests that structural modifications to increase its hydrophilicity may be necessary, in order to obtain better contrast in the abdominal region. Figure 5 does not display any non-specific retention of the radiotracer in the main organs and tissues (i.e., lung, heart, spleen, muscle, skin, and fat), with SUV values below 0.2 from 10 to 60 min. No brain penetration of [18F]1 was detected in accordance with the hydrophilic properties of [18F]1.

The resulting mixture was bubbled with helium flow for 20 s, then added to pre-purified [18F]4. After stirring for 20 s, sublimated azidotetrazine 7 (5.2 mg) in acetone (350 \u00b5L) was added. The final mixture was heated at 60 \u25e6C for 25 min, and cooled to 30 \u25e6C. A solution of sodium nitrite (30.5 mg) in H2O (300 \u00b5L) was introduced, and immediately after formic acid (100 \u00b5L). The mixture was stirred at 25\u201330 \u25e6C under helium for 5 min, then transferred into a large-volume vial for dilution. Dilution was performed by the addition of water (2 \u00d7 5 mL). The resulting mixture was passed onto a pre-conditioned Sep-Pak\u00ae tC18 Plus Long Environmental. After washing with water (10 mL), the Sep-Pak\u00ae tC18 was eluted with EtOH (1.5 mL). The ethanolic solution was diluted in phosphate buffer (3.5 mL, pH 2.1), and injected into semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC. The [18F]fluorosulfotetrazine [18F]1 was collected in a 72/28 mixture of phosphate buffer pH 2.1/EtOH (5 mL) over 1.5 min, from about 18 to 19.5 min after injection, then formulated by the addition of sodium bicarbonate in physiological serum (Lavoisier NaHCO3, 1.4%, 0.8 mL,) and Baxter NaCl Viaflo (0.9%, 9.2 mL). Using the automated process, the [18F]fluorosulfotetrazine [18F]1 (86 mCi \u2248 3.2 GBq) was obtained in a formulated solution ready for injection (15 mL total volume) at a 29\u201335% decay-corrected yield after 90\u201395 min of total time synthesis, and a molar activity of about 165 MBq/\u00b5mol (4.4 mCi/\u00b5mol), starting from about 18 GBq (485 mCi) of cyclotron-produced [18F]fluoride. Analytical HPLC of aliquots of the formulated solution displayed >97% radiochemical purity and >91% chemical purity.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 636 12 of 15\n3.3. Radiochemical and Chemical Purities, and Molar Activity of [18F]1\nAliquots of the formulated solution of [18F]1 were used to establish the chemical and radio-chemical purities, and molar activity. The determination was carried out using analytical HPLC and radio-TLC."

Analytical radioHPLC analyses were performed every 3 h for 9 h.\n3.6. Animal Studies 3.6.1. General Considerations\nThe animal investigations were performed under the current European directive (2010/63/EU), as incorporated in national legislation and in authorized laboratories (GIP Cyceron; E14118001). The experimental procedures were preliminarily approved from the regional committee on animal ethics (approval #3247). Healthy male SWISS mice were obtained from an in-house breeding stock at the \u201cCentre Universitaire de Ressources Biologiques\u201d (CURB; A14118015). All of the animals were housed in groups of 2 or more, with 12/12 h light-dark cycles, and with food and water ad libitum. The animals were maintained under isoflurane anesthesia throughout all procedures (induction 5%, maintenance around 2.5%, with 70% N2O/30% O2), and their body temperatures were maintained close to 37.5 \u25e6C using a feedback-controlled system (Minerve Veterinary Equipment, France) during experimentation. A catheter was inserted into the tail vein without surgery (Insyte\u2122 Autoguard\u2122, BD Medical, USA) for intravenous administration. Euthanasia of the animals was performed at the end of the protocol, using an isoflurane (5%) overdose.\n3.6.2. PET Imaging Experiments\nImaging studies were performed on a Inveon \u00b5PET/CT scanner (Siemens Healthcare Molecular Imaging). The respiratory rate was monitored during imaging sessions. Listmode PET data were acquired for 60 min, and this was initiated as soon as the formulated [18F]1 (~5.6 MBq/100 \u00b5L) was injected. The PET images were reconstructed using an iterative OSEM3D/MAP algorithm. Dead-time, random, scatter, as well as attenuation correction (based on CT) were applied. The image analysis was performed with P-Mod 3.7 software (P-MOD Technologies). Briefly, the PET and CT images were co-registered. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were semi-automatically delimitated for the following organs: bladder, bone, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and muscle, if available. Time-activity curves (TACs) were extracted from PET images, with the data expressed as standardized uptake value (SUVMean). SUV refers to the ratio of tissue radioactivity concentration at time t and administered dose at the time of [18F]1 injection, divided by body weight.\n3.6.3. In Vivo Stability Studies\nBlood (\u22481 mL) was sampled using intra-cardiac puncture, 30 min post-injection (29 MBq/100 \u00b5L); it was then heparinized and centrifuged (4024\u00d7 g, 5 min, 4 \u25e6C). Plasma was collected, mixed with one equivalent volume of acetonitrile, and centrifuged again (4024\u00d7 g, 10 min, 4 \u25e6C; >90% extraction yield). The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m PVDF, and then injected into analytical HPLC.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 636 13 of 15"

            "text": "In this study, original fluorotetrazine 1, lead compound of a new class of tetrazines bearing a sulfo group and a triazole ring, was designed, synthesized, and radiolabeled with fluorine-18. Next, the in vivo behavior of the radioactive [18F]1 was examined. The synthesis of 1 was accomplished efficiently using a CuAAC reaction between the novel azidotetrazine 7 and fluoroheptynylsulfonic acid 4. The tetrazine 1 demonstrated high reactivity towards the TCO reagent, rendering promising further extensions to the radiolabelling of biologics. The optimized radiosynthesis of [18F]1 involved the ring opening of propargylbutanesultone 2 with [18F]fluoride to afford [18F]fluoroheptynylsulfonic acid [18F]4, which reacted with the azidotetrazine 7 via the CuAAC reaction to provide [18F]1 in acceptable radiochemical yields, with high chemical and radiochemical purities. As expected, [18F]1 displayed hydrophilic properties, as shown by the LogP and LogD7.4 values, but also by the rapid and predominant renal and urinary excretion revealed by in vivo PET imaging. We also observed a fast clearance of radioactivity from tissues, an absence of non-specific uptake, and a high metabolic stability, making [18F]1 a suitable bioorthogonal reagent. Its evaluation for peptides radiolabeling as well as for pre-targeting applications is currently under investigation. This first fluorosulfotetrazine 1 also opens the way to the development of original analogues, with both increased hydrophilicity and reactivity in IEDDA reactions, in order to improve imaging. Chemical modifications of 1, such as the replacement of the methyl group by a pyridine substituent, are currently underway.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph16050636/s1, Figure S1: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 3; Figure S2: 13C NMR spectrum of compound 3; Figure S3: MS and HRMS analysis of compound 3; Figure S4: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 4; Figure S5: 13C NMR spectrum of compound 4; Figure S6: 19F NMR spectrum of compound 4; Figure S7: MS and HRMS analysis of compound 4; Figure S8: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 6; Figure S9: 13C NMR spectrum of compound 6; Figure S10: MS and HRMS analysis of compound 6; Figure S11: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 7; Figure S12: 13C NMR spectrum of compound 7; Figure S13: MS and HRMS analysis of compound 7; Figure S14: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 8; Figure S15: 13C NMR spectrum of compound 8; Figure S16: MS and HRMS analysis of compound 8; Figure S17: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S18: 13C NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S19: 19F NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S20: MS and HRMS analysis of compound 1; Figure S21: MS analysis of compound 1; Figure S22: RadioTLC analysis of crude compound [18F]4; Figure S23: HPLC analysis of crude compound [18F]4.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.P. and Y.S.; methodology, C.P. and Y.S.; investigation, J.B., S.G., Y.S. and C.P.; resources, C.P.; supervision, C.P.; validation, C.P.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.B. and C.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.P. and Y.S.; supervision, C.P.; project administration, C.P.; funding acquisition, C.P.
