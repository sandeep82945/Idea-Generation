    "abstractText": "The study described in this paper explored the understanding pre-service teachers\u2019 have of PK-12 student needs (i.e. Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity) and the importance of meeting these needs in a climate of Invitational Education. 71 undergraduate teacher education candidates enrolled in a Classroom Management course at a mid-sized Southeastern university in the U.S, learned about the Circle of Courage. This included viewing the movie Freedom Writers to focus of on how this philosophy was incorporated in the movie. Following the viewing, the participants wrote an essay about the significance of meeting these student needs. This activity enabled the participants to link theory to practice, as it prompted them to take a reflective stance, identify some of the strategies they witnessed in the movie, and evaluate how these might benefit their future students. When pre-service teachers enroll in my Classroom Management and Communications course, for the most part, I believe they expect a bag-of-tricks on how to discipline students when they misbehave. One of the first things I tell them is that there is no such tool. They soon learn that the course is designed with a proactive approach in mind, and the most important lesson they will learn, is the significance of getting to know their students. The course revolves around creating a classroom management plan geared towards acknowledging the diverse needs PK-12 students have and the use of brainstorming techniques to meet these needs. In order to understand that most of these needs are universal, regardless of the age, the students participated in a short exercise at the beginning of the semester, discussing their own needs. The most commonly identified needs were: the need for a good education (having knowledgeable instructors and being presented with relevant and accurate information); the need to feel safe in class (they can speak up their minds without fear of being judged or ridiculed by instructor or peers); the need to have instructors who care about the success of their students (who are flexible, have high expectations, and are available for office hours); and the need to have a choice (in classroom projects, sitting accommodations, and group work). When looking closely at their own needs, the preservice teachers realize that their students will have similar needs. This is how our classroom discussion about the significance to meet the basic student needs begins. The goal of this study was to increase pre-service teachers\u2019 understanding of the significance of meeting basic student needs (i.e. Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity). This understanding was facilitated by viewing the movie Freedom Writers (DeVito, Shamberg, Sher, & LaGravenese, 2007). The theoretical perspective of this study draws from the theories of the Circle of Courage (Brendtro, Brokenleg, & Van Bockern, 1990) and Invitational Education (Purkey, 1999). The media device used in this study, the movie Freedom Writers, can be interchanged with other inspirational education movies, helping pre-service teachers to develop the following understanding; when teachers care about their students, they create a climate of trust, respect, and optimism, influencing their students\u2019 attitudes about school and their academic performance (Purkey & Novak, 2001). In such a climate, \u201chuman potential can be realized best by places, policies, processes, and programs specifically designed to invite development and by people who are personally and professionally inviting with themselves and with others.\u201d (Purkey & Novak, 2008, p. 17).",

The four basic needs discussed by Bloom (2009) are in perfect alignment with Purkey and Novak\u2019s (2001) six features of the Inviting Family Model; respect for individual uniqueness, cooperative spirit, sense of belonging, pleasing habitat, positive expectations, and vital connections to society.\nIn essence, a sense of belonging is a sense of relatedness and attachment to others and to the school environment. Through cooperative learning and democratic classroom practices students work towards a common goal developing a connection to the community (Vieno, Perkins, Smith, & Santielo, 2005). In order to foster Mastery, Bloom (2009) discusses the need for teachers to help students adopt goals related to learning and de-emphasize goals related to performance. When students are engaged in learning goals they develop positive self-efficacy beliefs (Wolters, 2004). Teachers foster independence when they create opportunities for students to make individual choices, empowering them to regulate their own actions (Johnson & Johnson, 2004). Equally significant, the spirit of generosity involves the sense that one can give back to the community.\nIn an inviting environment, the educator respects the individual uniqueness of their students (their need for Independence); the educator fosters a sense of belonging and a pleasing habitat (the need for Belonging); the educator maintains positive expectations (the need for Mastery); and the educator helps develop a cooperative spirit, while at the same time enabling the students to make connections with the outside world (the need for Generosity)."

Children develop a feeling of belonging in school when they form relationships with peers and adults (Catalano, Haggerty, Oesterle, Fleming, & Hawkins, 2004), when they feel they are loved (Glasser, 1990), and when they recognize they are valued and cared for (Coppersmith, 1967). The many benefits of fostering Belonging in the classroom include, among others, an increase in the academic achievement and a decrease in negative behaviors (Catalano et al., 2004; McNeely & Falci, 2004).\nTeachers, by being aware of the policies, programs, and procedures employed in the classroom, have a guide for developing feelings of Belonging in each child. Examples of places, policies, programs, and procedures include: (a) a positive classroom climate in which the teacher actively invites student participation; (b) acceptance of differing views by demonstrating respect and trusting students to follow the teacher\u2019s example; and (c) collaboration among students in structured activities, but also providing support for students to establish peer relationships supportive of cooperative engagement."

From a classroom management perspective, the implications of fostering Mastery are invaluable: first, a sense of achievement feeds intrinsic motivation, leading to further achievement; and secondly, a person\u2019s perception of competence has a great influence over their choice and behavior (Bloom, 2009). Students develop a sense of mastery when they are able to perform a socially valued task (Charles, 2011), when they feel competent and useful (Sagor, 2002), and when they are in an environment where they experience a sense of control and power over their learning (Glasser, 1990).\nIn this climate of intentionality, teachers \u201care committed to the continuous appreciation and growth of all involved in the educative process\u201d (Purkey & Novak, 2008, p. 14). Through the policies, programs and procedures employed in the classroom, teachers foster Mastery, enabling their students to develop intellectually and socially. Experiences that foster the need of Mastery include: engaging students in collaborative projects in which they learn from and teach their peers; helping students achieve meaningful success (seeing mistakes as learning opportunities); and creating opportunities for students to use their intellectual, social, and physical potential in all sorts of situations (Purkey & Novak, 2008). According to Aronson (2004), Mastery is also accomplished when teachers emphasize improvement, by focusing on effort and practice rather than perfection, and when they engage their students in activities that promote collaboration rather than competition."

Teachers can support or thwart autonomy in the class\u201d (Bloom, 2009, p. 30).\nVolume 19, 2013\nWhen teachers support autonomy, by fostering creativity and deep information processing, students are more engaged (Reeve, Jang, Carrell, Jeon, & Barch, 2004), and as a result, school attendance improves (Vansteenkiste, Lens, & Deci, 2006).\nIn a democratic classroom, teachers foster independence by giving students a voice, listening to their input, giving students choices in terms of assignments, and allowing students to think for themselves. Purkey and Novak (2008) contended that \u201cpeople who are affected by decisions have a say in formulating these decisions\u201d (Purkey & Novak, 2008).

Curwin (1993) discusses a noticeable change in both attitudes and behavior of students affiliated with gangs when they served as tutors and caregivers.\nWhen teachers create opportunities for students to engage in peer tutoring, community, school, and/or classroom service students learn to care about someone else and contribute to the good of the community of learners. By helping their students acquire a mindset in which they \u201clink significant personal means with worthwhile societal ends\u201d (Purkey & Novak, 2008, p. 16), teachers help create the sense of altruism in students.

Freedom Writers\nwon the popular vote, and the students watched the movie during a class session at the time that had been previously scheduled.\nA short discussion about the story line followed the movie watching, and then students briefly reflected on Ms. Gruwell\u2019s students\u2019 needs as portrayed in the movie. This discussion did not focus on any of the classroom practices that Ms. Gruwell used to meet her students\u2019 needs. Since my students had to write an essay about how the teacher met the basic student needs, I did not want to steer them in any direction.\nFreedom Writers is a prime example of real-life application of the Circle of Courage as the teacher is constantly meeting her students\u2019 needs. Countless examples of Belonging are intertwined with examples of Mastery, Independence, and Generosity. The teacher successfully modeled the four pillars of the Circle of Courage, creating a climate of intentionality, which encouraged competence, independence, caring, respecting, and helping one another. The students can only be as successful as their teacher in displaying generosity, care, and respect. In a recent study, Pimentel (2010) describes using the movie as a starting point in identifying racial discourse in the Hollywood films. On the other hand, Choi\u2019s study (2009) discussed the four prevalent themes in Freedom Writers; rewriting curriculum, treating students as creators of knowledge, creating classroom community, and teaching as self-realization."

A series of participants discussed the real-life application of this activity. For example, one participant stated: \u201cThe movie definitely expanded my knowledge of the Circle of Courage and showed it in a real world sense. It put actions into words and showed exactly what each of the four qualities was meant to be.\u201d Another participant explained the significance of seeing this incorporated in the classroom activities: \u201cThe movie helped because we were able to see it put in action\u2026I understand the Circle of Courage so much more now due to the movie putting it into perspective for me.\u201d\nOther participants echoed similar thoughts:\nI have learned a lot about the Circle of Courage this semester, but watching this movie put it all into perspective as I finally see such an awesome example of an effective teacher and what it means to instill Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity.\nAnother participant reflected:\nThe movie Freedom Writers is a perfect example of how to incorporate the Circle of Courage in the classroom, and it shows me how it is possible and why it is important. It was amazing to see a real life example of how a teacher took the Circle of Courage into her own hands to truly change her students\u2019 lives.\nOther participants believed that their understanding increased because they could see the impact addressing these needs had on Ms. Gruwell\u2019s students. Said one participant: \u201cThe movie increased my understanding of the Circle of Courage because it showed that when fostering Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity, the teacher reaches out to affect every type of student.\u201d Another participant commented: \u201cThe movie did a great job portraying that it does not matter who your students are, if you foster these four aspects, you will engage the students and they can succeed.\u201d\nAnother participant specifically explained what she took from this activity, which would help her become a better teacher:\nThe movie and the philosophy of Circle of Courage increased my understanding about the need to foster Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity in my classroom. I think the most important is Belonging. When you show your students that you care about them\nand they are needed, everything else begins to fall into place. I need to take the time to get to know my students and make sure I am incorporating Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity into my teaching.\nAnother participant commented on the teacher\u2019s responsibility to meet the basic students\u2019 needs:\nI have now seen the difference it makes when students are welcomed into an environment where they can feel comfortable, safe and appreciated, while at the same time challenged. I have come to realize how important it is for the teacher to take on this responsibility.\nAn increased understanding and practical application in their future classroom is also the case of another pre-service teacher, who stated:\nI never realized how important it was to make students feel as though they belong and how to be generous, and I never knew ways to teach students Mastery and Independence either. Both the movie and the Circle of Courage gave me many ideas of how to foster these needs. Before reviewing the Circle of Courage and watching the movie, my ideas of fostering the four needs would be less impressive than Ms. Gruwell\u2019s.\nFurthermore, one participant discussed how this activity changed his previous beliefs about meeting basic student needs:\nBefore watching this movie I can honestly say I thought the Circle of Courage was something I did not believe in, and something that I would never use in my classroom. Freedom Writers showed me the Circle of Courage could be very effective for use in certain classrooms. It can be used to break down the barriers that are often developed between different groups of students. Not only did it encourage social interaction, the Circle of Courage also promoted learning as well.\nAlthough not all participants\u2019 understandings of the basic student needs dramatically increased as part of this activity, the movie and the philosophy served as a reinforcement of the significance for a teacher to be in tune with his/her students\u2019 needs as one of the most important prerequisites to classroom management. One of the two participants who responded that this activity did not increase their\nVolume 19, 2013\nunderstanding of the student needs explained that this happened because he \u201chad a reasonable understanding and belief about these necessities beforehand.\u201d The student went on to explain: \u201cIt did, however, reinforce these central values and gave a great practical example of how this sort of attitude can change even the most dismal of situations.\u201d\nSimilarly, the other participant stated that even if the movie did not increase his understanding of the Circle of Courage, \u201cit did provide a more tangible [idea] of how the Circle of Courage may be implemented in a classroom setting.\u201d The student further discussed the significance of this philosophy: \u201cI do realize that the Circle of Courage is, as the name implies, a circle. All it takes is a person brave enough to open his/her heart to one another in order to get the metaphorical wheels turning. Once the circle has been started, it will continue to rotate from Belonging, all the way to Generosity, as it spreads from person to person.\u201d\nThe above findings indicate that for the most part, the participants\u2019 understanding of the student needs highly increased through the exposure to both the philosophy and the movie. Even in the case of the students who stated they did not gain more understanding of the need to foster Belonging, Mastery, Generosity, and Independence in their classrooms, as they had been aware of these needs, they both felt that the movie and the philosophy served as a good refresher of the teacher\u2019s role in fostering a climate of invitational education (acceptance, encouragement, challenge, etc.).\nIn order for pre-service teachers to foster an invitational climate in their future classrooms they need to understand not only what the basic student needs are, but also how to meet these needs: \u201cClassroom management practices can affect the amount of time that students are engaged in learning, their attitudes toward learning, their motivation, and their willingness and ability to collaborate with each other\u201d (Bloom, 2009, p.35). The professional literature (Hanze & Berger, 2007; Johnson & Johnson, 2004; Reeve et al., 2004; Vieno et al., 2005) illustrates many examples of classroom practices that support the four pillars of the Circle of Courage, describing its benefit to student learning. Thus, it became essential for the participants to have a clear understanding of how to use these pillars in their own classrooms. The section below focuses on how the participants interpreted instances of Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity in Freedom Writers."

The participants unanimously believed the teacher fostered a community of learners, despite the fact that Belonging was \u201cprobably Ms. Gruwell\u2019s toughest challenge when she first came in because students had so much hostility toward one another.\u201d After watching the movie, the participants believed that in order to create a climate of Belonging in their classrooms, teachers needed to show their students they cared about them, while at the same time teaching them to care about each other.\nThe participants were in agreement that Ms. Gruwell fostered a positive classroom atmosphere by greeting her students at the door, making the room feel like home, arranging the desks in a way in which no ethnic group felt segregated, and helping students to discover things they had in common and appreciate the things that distinguished them. Moreover, students developed a feeling of Belonging when they felt the teacher valued their ideas and opinions, and when they could speak without fear of being judged or ridiculed.

One participant stated: \u201cSeeing her generosity towards the class made the students become generous towards one another. The students become better in decision making.\u201d\nThis was obvious in the fact that Ms. Gruwell\u2019s students learned to stand up for the truth, as exemplified by Eva, who testified against \u201cher own\u201d and thus defended an innocent man. One participant stated: \u201c[Ms. Gruwell] planted the seed in Eva that eventually changed the life of an innocent man.\u201d Maybe the participants of this study will not have their students go through dramatic situations like Ms. Gruwell\u2019s students, and maybe their displays of generosity will be to a smaller scale. However, they all understood that generosity needed to be modeled. It only takes on small act of kindness to change a life.\nPurkey and Novak (2008) advocate that when educators assume an inviting stance they foster a climate of respect, trust, care, optimism, and intentionality in their classrooms. These five elements mirror the four pillars of the Circle of Courage philosophy. For example, in a classroom that fosters Belonging, educators care about their students and teach their students to care for one another. In such an environment the educators develop trust-worthy relationships with their students. In turn, in order for educators to foster Mastery feelings in their classrooms they build on the bonds of care, trust, and respect that they have developed with their students. Moreover, optimism (the belief in students\u2019 potential to meet the teacher\u2019s expectations) is another very important component of a Mastery environment.\nTeachers who foster Independence in their classrooms respect their students, and they demonstrate this respect by involving their students in the decision-making process. Finally, Generosity is accomplished when students learn to care about one another, about the classroom and school community, as well as the outside world. A climate of intentionality is created when people are personally and professionally inviting to themselves and others (Purkey & Novak, 2008).\nOne of the most common critiques about the theories preservice teachers learn as part of their teacher education programs is the fact that these theories paint a pink picture of PK-12 school life, and they have little in common to the real world (i.e. budget cuts, large class sizes, limited resources, diverse students with diverse learning needs, limited time to meet all these needs, lack of support from school administration, etc.). Pre-service teachers need to see this philosophy at play to understand its real-life application. I tried to make this experience relevant for the students in my class in two ways: by having them experience firsthand an invitational setting in our own classrooms, and by having them observe an invitational setting in a movie inspired by reality.\nAn effective teacher develops positive relationships with their students and models the behaviors they expect to see from their students. I strongly believe in order to teach about the significance to meet basic student needs it is important that the environment I create in my classrooms is an invitational one, where students feel I care about them, that I respect them, that I am enthusiastic about the subject matter, and that a bond of trust can be formed between all classroom participants. I hope that they carry these in their future classroom and \u201cassume an inviting stance toward their students\u201d (Purkey & Novak, 2008).\nVolume 19, 2013\nEqually significant, I wanted my students to see how the Invitational Education theory (Purkey, 1999) and the Circle of Courage can be found in a K-12 setting, similar to the ones they may find themselves teaching in. The movie Freedom Writers enabled us to take an outsider stance and observe how Ms. Gruwell built a community with her students by fostering Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity in her classroom."

            "text": "According to the participants, the value of this activity lay in its practical application. The movie allowed them to see examples of activities the teacher used successfully in her class, creating bonds with and among her students. The participants identified many great strategies to create such bonds of trust between them and their future students. However, due to the lack of space, I will only focus on three such practices: the field trips, the \u201cToast for Change,\u201d and the teacher\u2019s resilience to obtain needed supplies and funding to meet student academic needs. One of the favorite strategies the pre-service teachers identified was the use of field trips to accompany instruction. Discussing the many benefits of the school trips, one participant stated:\nClass field trips show students that learning is fun and it can take place anywhere. Removing students from their usual setting within the classroom can reinvigorate their zest for learning. Field trips show students that textbooks are not the only way in which a lesson is taught.\nAnother participant discussed the need to expose students to different cultures through visits to museums:\nBeing in an elementary setting, I think that field trips to museums and art galleries would be a great idea for my students to get to see and experience. For some students this may be the only time they get to see these things and I think it helps students to experience different cultures and different ways people might have lived.\nAnother participant focused on the benefit to expose students to places outside their comfort zone:\nI think field trips are great because they show students a glimpse of the real world they will soon be part of if they choose. It takes them places they otherwise would not have visited and it opens their eyes to the different opportunities the world has to offer.\nAnother very important lesson the participants learned from watching the movie is to put their students\u2019 needs above anything else, even if it means challenging policies set in place. Two participants discussed the significance to have the courage to ask for things students or the schools do not have. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be afraid to go above my school representative to ask for the proper materials my students need to succeed when I am their teacher,\u201d confessed one participant. The other stated:\nOne of the practices Ms. Gruwell used that I will incorporate in the classroom is not to be discouraged by inadequate administration. This is a reality in every job field, and education is no exception. Ms. Gruwell was able to change some policies and practices by simply being persistent.\nThe Toast for Change was another practice the pre-service teachers stated they would use in their future classrooms to help their students set goals. One participant stated:\nI like the idea of the Toast for Change because it is an opportunity for students to state their goals and commit to attaining them. It becomes a covenant between the teacher and the student to do everything possible for the student to achieve success in the classroom.\nAnother participant explained how she would use the Toast as a way to establish trust and caring in students:\nThe Toast for Change is a great way to encourage your students to celebrate a new beginning. It motivates the students to achieve their goals because they are the ones who came up with them. Announcing it to the class also provides them with the opportunity to receive accountability from their peers.\nResearchers (McDiarmid & Clevenger-Bright, 2008; Zeichner, 2003) continue to discuss the need to link the theoretical foundations of teacher education programs with practical experiences in the school setting in an attempt to \u201cbridge the divide between the higher education institutions where teachers are prepared and the school sites where they work with students\u201d (Rinke, Arsenie, & Bell, 2012, p. 99). This need is constantly reiterated by my students, every time I teach Classroom Management, as pre-service teachers constantly ask themselves: \u201cHow can I apply this theory into my classroom?\u201d\nAlthough on a very small scale, the Freedom Writers activity enabled my students to link theory to practice, as it prompted\nVolume 19, 2013\nthem to take a reflective stance, identify some of the strategies they witnessed in the movie, and evaluate how these would benefit their future students. This echoes Ryan and Townsend\u2019s (2012) conclusion of using media devices in the teacher education classes: \u201cThrough analyzing the scenes depicted with ever-deepening reflection, pre-service teachers can develop a repertoire of instructional strategies that would otherwise only be achieved after the initial novice years of teaching.\u201d"

            "text": "The above findings indicate that the majority of the participants deemed this classroom activity relevant (discussing the student basic needs in the context of watching Freedom Writers), as they stated it made them more aware of these needs in their classrooms. The theories discussed in any Classroom Management course are extremely important in creating a positive learning environment for all our students, but they may not be enough to increase the preservice teachers\u2019 understanding of the significance of such theories. When pre-service teachers have many opportunities to discuss the theories they read about in the textbooks, and when this theoretical background is coupled with real-life applications, their appreciation for learning about meeting basic student needs increases (Rinke et al., 2012; Ryan & Townsend, 2012).\nI created this movie assignment as an opportunity for the students to observe how the theories they study in class apply in the real world. I understand the limited practical orientation this assignment provided, and furthermore I realize that an optimal experience would have come from a Field II Placement where the pre-service teachers may observe firsthand whether and to what extent the teachers meet their students\u2019 needs. However, not all the pre-service teachers enrolled in this course were taking a Field II component, and some would have been left with just the theoretical approach of the textbook.\nFurthermore, when given opportunities to see successful practices used by real classroom teachers in the media, preservice teachers learn the value of the different theories discussed in their education courses, as well as they uncover the real-life application of these theories. Inspirational stories enable pre-service teachers to emulate behaviors they see portrayed by the successful teachers, and it helps them\nunderstand the need to care for all their students. Ryan and Townsend (2012) commented on the benefits of incorporating media examples in teacher education classes, as analyses of popular media representations \u201ccan offer surrogate experiences upon which to develop an educational philosophy and to consider classroom strategies as well as opportunities for future teachers to explore their own preconceptions about teaching that may well have been influenced by such representations\u201d (Ryan & Townsend, 2012, p.239).\nAs a result of watching this movie, the participants took away a few strategies they stated they would like to incorporate in their classrooms (i.e. the journal writing, making the room inviting, connecting content with real life situations, and field trips). Others discussed activities they would slightly alter to meet the needs of the particular age group they would teach (Toast for Change, the line game), and some went even further and discussed the need to be resilient and stand up for their students.\nThe success of this activity inspired me to continue using the movie Freedom Writers while discussing meeting basic student needs. In the semesters following this study I slightly modified this activity by using a few representative fragments of the movie in class, or making it a Bonus Points option, having the students watch the movie at home and answer the essay questions for extra points. Although deemed significant by the students who chose to do the activity, these modifications did not have the impact that watching the movie as a group and then discussing its implications for their future teaching did. Only showing a few segments did not do justice to the whole movie, as it is filled with examples of Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity activities. Furthermore, since it was no longer a classroom assignment, only a few students watched the movie and completed the essay.\nAs I teach this course every semester, I continue to brainstorm ways to make the Classroom Management theories relevant for pre-service teachers. I hope these shared findings may serve as an encouragement for other teacher educators to continue to use diverse media tools in their classrooms to enable their students to see how theory plays in the real classrooms.\nVolume 19, 2013\nReferences\nAronson, J.
