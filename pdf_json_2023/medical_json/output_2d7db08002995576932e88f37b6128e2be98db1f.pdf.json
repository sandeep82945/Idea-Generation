This technique bridges the gap between high-resolution ex-situ single particle analysis and low-resolution, insitu data, i.e. from correlative light microscopy or other complementary methods [1,2]. The workflow for preparing a frozenhydrated sample, thinning cellular samples to electron transparency, cryo-ET imaging, and tomogram reconstruction is already highly streamlined. Hence, the accessible biological questions depend solely on vitrification and the subsequent preparation of the specimen. However, while there exist many techniques to preserve whole cells or tissues in specific conditions, transient events inside cells remain largely occluded [3, 4]. In order to freeze a cellular sample within short-lived states, a custom microscope stage has been developed by Mejia et al., where a gradient between a cell suspension inside a microchannel and a cold reservoir is maintained by thin-film-resistive heaters [3]. The heaters maintain the yeast growth conditions, thus allowing their observation by live imaging with an upright microscope. At a desired timepoint, the power to the heaters is switched off and the sample vitrifies within several milliseconds. Nevertheless, cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling and time-consuming cryo-lift-out had to be implemented to access the biological material for cryo-ET data acquisition [5]. Here, we will present the prototype of a new cryogenic microscope stage for the timed vitrification of single cells with the aim to produce lamellae directly inside a microfluidic channel. The stage comprises several novel features such as customizable microfluidics, nano-fabricated microheaters, a stage body with a 96-well plate footprint for typical inverse fluorescence microscopes, and off-the-shelf electronics to control the stage as well as microfluidic temperature. In the core of our assembly, single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are trapped inside a microfluidic device and attached to a cryo-FIB Auto-Grid. Upon vitrification, lamellae are produced in the microchannel by cryo-FIB milling procedures similar to the \u2018Waffle\u2019method [6]. We will also show workflow characterizations for preparing electron-transparent lamellae with the help of a plasma-FIB for poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidics. By an adaptive microfluidics design, this approach unlocks a multitude of dynamic processes previously inaccessible to cryo-FIB milling and, thus, allows for the investigation of new biological questions by cryo-ET.\nMicroscopy and Microanalysis, 29 (Suppl 1), 2023, 1937\u20131938 https://doi.org/10.1093/micmic/ozad067.1003\nMeeting-report\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m am /article/29/Supplem ent_1/1937/7228136 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nFig. 1.
