    "abstractText": "Microtubules are key structural elements of living cells that are crucial for cell division, intracellular transport, and motility. Recent experiments have shown that microtubule-severing proteins and molecular motors stimulate the direct and localized incorporation of free tubulin into the shaft. However, a mechanistic picture of how microtubule-associated proteins affect the lattice is completely missing. Here we theoretically explore a potential mechanism of lattice turnover stimulated by processive molecular motors in which a weak transient destabilization of the lattice by the motor stepping promotes the formation of mobile vacancies. In the absence of free tubulin the defect rapidly propagates, leading to a complete fracture. In the presence of free tubulin, the motor walk induces a vacancy drift in the direction opposite of the motor walk. The drift is accompanied by the direct and localized incorporation of free tubulin along the trajectory of the vacancy. Our results are consistent with experiments and strongly suggest that a weak lattice-motor interaction is responsible for an augmented microtubule shaft plasticity.",

Recent experiments have shown that microtubule-severing proteins and molecular motors stimulate the direct and localized incorporation of free tubulin into the shaft. However, a mechanistic picture of how microtubule-associated proteins affect the lattice is completely missing. Here we theoretically explore a potential mechanism of lattice turnover stimulated by processive molecular motors in which a weak transient destabilization of the lattice by the motor stepping promotes the formation of mobile vacancies. In the absence of free tubulin the defect rapidly propagates, leading to a complete fracture. In the presence of free tubulin, the motor walk induces a vacancy drift in the direction opposite of the motor walk. The drift is accompanied by the direct and localized incorporation of free tubulin along the trajectory of the vacancy. Our results are consistent with experiments and strongly suggest that a weak lattice-motor interaction is responsible for an augmented microtubule shaft plasticity.\nDOI: 10.1103/PRXLife.1.013012\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMicrotubules (MTs) are self-organized polar tubelike polymers and constitute a major component of the cytoskeleton. They play a central role in cell division, intracellular transport, and motility. MTs are dynamic dissipative structures, which grow or shrink primarily by tubulin dimer addition or removal at their extremities, labeled (+) and (\u2212) ends. Their nonequilibrium behavior results from the irreversible hydrolysis of GTP tubulin into GDP tubulin upon polymerization [1] and manifests itself as stochastic transitions between growth and shrinkage phases, called dynamic instability [2\u20136]. The dynamic instability of the MT tip has been a major focus of MT research over the past 30 years. In contrast, the MT shaft has been considered as an inert structure, due to the high stability of the intact lattice far away from the extremities [7]. However, an early experiment with end-stabilized MTs by Dye et al. [8] clearly showed that the shaft may lose and incorporate tubulin dimers directly. Later it was shown that GTP dimers (or dimers in the GTP conformation) exist outside of the cap region [9], without a clear picture of how the GTP state could survive sufficiently long to be detectable in the shaft. A very recent series of experiments revealed that the shaft lattice exhibits a spontaneous dynamics, part of which is linked to lattice dislocations [10,11]. Perturbing the lattice externally via periodic weak mechanical forcing [12] or the activity of MT-associated proteins, e.g., MT-severing enzymes or molecular motors [13\u201316], has been shown to\n*karin.john@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Furthermore, regions of high curvature or regions in close contact either with a surface or another microtubule could be sites of direct tubulin exchange [17].\nIt has been shown experimentally and theoretically that dislocations are preferential sites of lattice dynamics [11]. These structures are inherent in the lattice and are created during the polymerization process. The same holds for recently identified multiseam MTs [18], which entail the existence of point defects of the size of a tubulin monomer. However, the experimentally observed increase in shaft plasticity due to severing enzymes and molecular motors [13\u201316] suggests the nucleation of defects in the intact lattice. One obvious possibility of de novo created sites of lattice exchange are vacancies of the size of a single tubulin dimer. These point defects have been identified by scanning force microscopy of dynamic MTs [19] and it has already been speculated that long-lived point defects may serve as a point of attack for MT-severing enzymes [20]. A recent experiment suggests that the combined walk of several kinesins is able remove tubulin dimers from the lattice [21].\nHere, we explore theoretically the role of point defects in the MT shaft plasticity in the presence of molecular motors. Thereby we employ the term \u201cplasticity\u201d to denote the removal of tubulin dimers from the MT lattice or the integration of tubulin dimers into the MT lattice far away from the MT extremities. Our objective is to provide a first mechanistic concept consistent with recent experiments on MT-motor interactions [14\u201316]. To that end we employ a kinetic Monte Carlo model and investigate (i) the kinetics of the formation of point defects, (ii) the progression of the defect size until complete MT fracture in the absence of free tubulin, and (iii) the dynamics of point defects in the presence of free tubulin. These processes will be studied in the absence and presence of processive molecular motors, which transiently and locally\n2835-8279/2023/1(1)/013012(15) 013012-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nweakly destabilize the lattice as they walk along the lattice. Since many details of the dynamic properties of the MT shaft lattice are unknown, we are focusing on very basic processes to recover the relevant length and time-scale of the MT shaft dynamics that were observed experimentally."

            "text": "We use a simple and robust kinetic Monte Carlo model to investigate the MT shaft dynamics in the presence of processive molecular motors. The basic model setup and kinetic transitions are schematically summarized in Fig. 1. Similar types of kinetic Monte Carlo models have been used, e.g., to study the microtubule tip dynamics [22\u201326], the dynamics of dislocations in the MT shaft [11], and the dynamics of motors walking along the lattice [27]. The model parameters (see Table I) are comparable to values found in the literature and are adapted to reproduce typical polymerization (\u223c2 \u00b5m min\u22121) and depolymerization speeds (\u223c20 \u00b5m min\u22121) of the MT tip, the dynamic instability of the MT (+) end (cf. Fig. 5), and the typical motor speeds and run length for kinesin and yeast dynein motors. Here, we specifically aim to study the creation and dynamics of dimer vacancies in the presence of motors using a basic set of kinetic transitions previously established and amended by weak motor-lattice interactions\na. MT lattice structure. We model the canonical microtubule lattice (13 protofilaments, three-start left-handed helix [28,29]) as a square lattice on the scale of the dimer; i.e., each dimer has two longitudinal and two lateral neighbors as previously introduced [11,22,24]. The lattice is periodic in a direction perpendicular to the long axis of the microtubule with an offset of 3/2 lattice sites to reproduce the seam structure [see Fig. 1(a)]. Lattice sites can be either empty or occupied by GTP-bound (T) or GDP-bound (D) dimers. Dimers interact with other dimers on nearest-neighbor lattice\nsites via attractive interactions, characterized by bond energies G1 and G2 for longitudinal and lateral bonds, respectively. Each dimer-dimer contact across the seam is counted with a binding energy G2/2; i.e., in the fully occupied lattice, dimers at the seam have the same binding energy as dimers in the bulk lattice. We assume that longitudinal bonds of T-T contacts are further stabilized by the energy, GT1 [30\u201332]. We assume a lattice anisotropy in the binding energies of G1/ G2 = 2, that is, longitudinal contacts are twice as stable as lateral contacts in the GDP lattice, consistent with estimates obtained by kinetic modeling of the MT tip dynamics [22] and molecular dynamics simulations [33].\nb. Basic MT lattice transitions. We consider the following transitions: free GTP dimers can polymerize into a lattice structure, bound GTP dimers can depolymerize from the lattice or hydrolyze into GDP dimers, and bound GDP dimers can depolymerize from the lattice [Fig. 1(b)]. GTP dimers attach to a vacant lattice site with rate constant kon, if at least one neighboring lattice site is occupied by a dimer. We assume an infinite reservoir of free GTP-tubulin dimers at concentration c. We do not consider the attachment of GDP dimers; i.e., for free tubulin the exchange GDP \u2192 GTP is rapid compared to dimer attachment. Dimers detach from the lattice with rate constant koff depending on their lattice environment (for details see the Appendix):\nkoff = k\u2217off e\u03b2( Gb+\u03b4\u2212 G \u2217 ), (1)\nwhere \u03b2\u22121 = kBT is the thermal energy, Gb denotes the binding energy (upon transferring a free dimer from the solution into the lattice), \u03b4 denotes a (weak, transient) contribution due to lattice-motor interactions, and G\u2217 denotes the binding energy at the microtubule tip with a GTP cap (i.e., the binding energy of a GTP dimer with one lateral and one longitudinal GTP-dimer neighbor). k\u2217off denotes the reference off-rate constant for a dimer with binding energy Gb = G\u2217 (see\n013012-2\nTable I). It defines the timescale \u03c4 = (k\u2217off )\u22121 \u2248 1 s, which has been obtained by calibrating the tip dynamics with experimentally measured velocities of MT growth and shrinkage.\nGTP dimers are irreversibly hydrolyzed into GDP dimers by the rate constant kh if their hydrolyzable \u03b2 subunit is in contact with the \u03b1 subunit of another dimer, that is, if the longitudinal lattice site in the direction of the microtubule (+) end is occupied [34].\nOne key assumption, relevant only for the MT shaft, is a steric hindrance for GTP dimers to integrate or leave the GDP lattice, if all four neighboring lattice sites are occupied by dimers and if the two lateral neighbors are GDP dimers. Here we follow the observationthat the more extended (in the direction of the protofilament) conformation of GTP dimers compared to GDP dimers [30,35] prevents the integration or removal of a GTP dimer in a GDP-lattice environment, comparable to stacked LEGO bricks. This mechanism has no consequences for the dynamics of the microtubule tip; however, it has far-reaching consequences for the microtubule shaft: once a GDP dimer has left its GDP-lattice environment and created a point defect, this point defect cannot be closed immediately by integrating a free GTP-tubulin dimer from the solution. We will investigate the consequences of this effect extensively in the Results section.\nc. Transitions of molecular motors. The driven transport of molecular motors along protofilaments has been studied in detail before (see, e.g., the review in Ref. [36]). Here, we used a motor dynamics described by a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) supplemented by attachment and detachment processes as studied, e.g., in Refs. [27,37]. The relevant kinetic transitions for motors are summarized in Fig. 1(c). Here we consider two types of motors, fast kinesinlike (+)-end directed motors [38,39] and more slow yeast-dynein-like (\u2212)-end directed motors [40\u201342]. Molecular motors can bind to two adjacent unoccupied tubulin dimers along the same protofilament with rate constant k+ and may detach from the microtubule, when bound to two dimers, with rate constant k\u2212 or, when bound to one dimer, with rate constant kE\u2212 = \u03b8k\u2212 [43]. Here we assume a fast motor detachment with \u03b8 = 100. Lattice bound motors step along the microtubule in a single direction (i.e., kinesin towards the (+) end, dyneins towards the (\u2212) end) with rate constant kw, if the next lattice site in the stepping direction in not occupied by another motor. We only allow motors to step forward if their front head (in the walking direction) is bound to a dimer. If a motor is bound to the lattice by a single dimer (i.e., the second head occupies a vacancy) the underlying dimer may detach from the lattice (with koff), taking thereby the motor with it.\nd. Motor-lattice interactions. We consider two types of lattice-motor interactions:\n(i) Two tubulin dimers which are bound to the same motor are not authorized to leave the lattice.\n(ii) The irreversible motor step along the protofilament transiently \u201cexcites\u201d the underlying tubulin lattice, inducing a slightly less stable (\u201cexcited\u201d) conformation; i.e., tubulin dimers (situated under the front head of a bound motor) are excited by the motor walk with rate constant kw by the weak energy increment \u03b4 [see Eq. (1)] and relax back to the \u201cground\u201d state with the rate constant kr. The excitation\nreaction represents the crucial coupling mechanism between the motor walk and the underlying MT lattice.\nA characterization of the steady-state behavior of motors (density, flux) and the fractions of excited and ground-state dimers, \u03c6e and \u03c6g, depending on the ratio of motor attachment and detachment rate constants \u03bc = k+/k\u2212 and the ratio of motor stepping rate constant and lattice relaxation rate constant \u03bd = kw/kr can be found in Fig. 6."

            "text": "When a motor walks along a perfect lattice (i.e., no point defect present along the protofilament), at each step an underlying tubulin dimer is weakly destabilized by the energy penalty \u03b4. In the following we will explore this effect on the initial creation of a point defect (a single missing dimer or vacancy) and, vice versa, the effect of the existence of a point defect on the motor walk and the consequence for the lattice stability in the vicinity of the defect.\nFigure 2(a) shows the fraction of excited and ground-state dimers which can potentially leave the lattice (i.e., they are not sterically blocked by a bound motor) for fast motors (kinesins) depending on the steady-state density of motors on the lattice. The fractions can be roughly estimated using the mean-field approach by [27]\n\u03c6e = (1 \u2212 2\u03c1) J J + kr , (2)\n\u03c6g = (1 \u2212 2\u03c1) kr J + kr , (3)\nwhere \u03c1 denotes the steady-state density of motor front heads and\nJ = kw\u03c1 1 \u2212 2\u03c1 1 \u2212 \u03c1 (4)\ndenotes the steady-state motor flux. The mean-field estimates [dashed lines in Fig. 2(a)] are slightly off the numerical results which is probably a consequence of the localized appearance of excited dimers and the strong correlations with the motor positions. For low motor densities the fraction of \u201cexcited\u201d dimers is increasing at the expense of the fraction of \u201cground-state\u201d dimers. However, for high motor densities, both fractions of excited and ground-state dimers are decreasing. The behavior reflects the jamming of motors (which reduces excitation of dimers) and the blocking of dimers from leaving the lattice by the bound motors.\nIf motors encounter a point defect, the steady-state motor density is perturbed since motors cannot walk \u201cover\u201d the point defect and have to detach [see Fig. 2(b)]. For fast motor detachment at the defect, the motor occupation of dimers in the vicinity (upstream and downstream) of the point defect is lower than in the intact lattice. Since we are not considering\n013012-3\nsidestepping motors, the motor flux on protofilaments adjacent to the point defect is not affected. Figure 2(c) shows the fraction of excited and ground-state dimers which can potentially leave the lattice immediately upstream and downstream (with respect to the walking direction of motors) to the point defect depending on the steady-state density of motors. Here we denote by steady-state motor density \u03c1 the corresponding density on the intact lattice without defects and which is reached for dimers far away upstream or downstream from the lattice. Upstream of the point defect, the fraction of excited dimers is increasing monotonously with the steady-state motor density. The fast detachment of the motors at the defect guarantees a finite motor flux even at jamming conditions far away from the defect. The motors barely affect the lattice\nimmediately downstream of the vacancy, since the motor density is here close to zero.\nThe weak destabilization of a tubulin dimer by the motor walk and the steric blocking of dimers by the presence of motors modify the rate constant koff for the dimer to detach from the lattice and to create a point defect. Since excitation and relaxation processes and the motor walk are fast compared to the residence time of dimers in the full lattice we can estimate the impact of the motor walk on the lattice using a quasi-steady-state assumption\nkoff,eff = koff ( Gb)[\u03c6ee\u03b2\u03b4 + \u03c6g], (5) where koff denotes the dimer off-rate constant in the absence of motors; \u03c6e and \u03c6g are determined by the motor speed kw and\n013012-4\nthe lattice relaxation rate constant kr. Figure 2(d) shows the effective rate constant of dimer removal koff,eff/koff depending on the steady-state motor density for kinesin motors and a fast lattice relaxation (kw/kr = 10, implying that at low motor density each motor walks with a trail of ten excited dimers in its wake) for various values of the motor-inflicted tubulin dimer destabilization values \u03b4. Motors, which do not destabilize the lattice (\u03b4 = 0), have a slightly stabilizing effect, due to sterically blocking the dimers from leaving the lattice. However, a small transient perturbation of the lattice as small as \u03b4 = 3kBT leads to a tenfold increase in the off-rate constant for moderate motor lattice occupations of \u03c1 = 0.1 (note that \u03c1 = 0.5 indicates a lattice completely saturated with motors, each attached with two heads to two adjacent dimers).\nUsing slower walking dynein motors and maintaining a fast lattice relaxation (kw/kr = 1) we obtain qualitatively the same results; however, higher energy penalties \u03b4 are needed to produce the same effect as fast walking motors, since the density of excited dimers is lower (see Fig. 7). Interestingly, for slow motors, the effect of the motor walk on the off-rate constant of dimers located upstream of the vacancy is stronger than on the off-rate constant of dimers located in the intact lattice [cf. Figs. 7(d) and 7(e)]. Note that we do not consider side- or backstepping of motors. This assumption is valid for kinesin 1 [44\u201346]. In contrast, dyneins are known to side- and backstep frequently (10\u201320 % of steps are side or back steps [40,42,44]), which may quantitatively affect the motor flow and therefore the excitation of dimers. However, simulations for slow motors with 20% backward steps show only minor differences in the excitation state of dimers in the absence and presence of defects [cf. Figs. 7(a) and 7(c)].\nOnce a point defect has been created, its effects on the microtubule lattice dynamics are twofold:\n(i) Neighboring dimers are missing a lateral or longitudinal neighbor and therefore dimer detachment is accelerated.\n(ii) The point defect serves as an obstacle for the motor walk, altering the quasi-steady-state value of \u03c6e and \u03c6g and consequently the effective off-rate constant of dimers upstream of the defect, while the dimers downstream of the defect are depleted of motors.\nTherefore, a point defect affects the nearest-neighbor dimers in three different ways. Lateral dimers [top and bottom neighbors to the defect in Fig. 1(c)] experience an unperturbed motor flow and may leave the lattice with an effective off-rate constant given by Eq. (5) with the dimer fractions \u03c6g and \u03c6e as given in Fig. 2(a). Longitudinal neighbors upstream of the point defect [left neighbor to the defect in Fig. 1(c)] leave the lattice with an effective off-rate constant given by Eq. (5) with the dimer fractions \u03c6g and \u03c6e as given in Fig. 2(c). Longitudinal neighbors downstream of the point defect [right neighbor to the defect in Fig. 1(c)] are barely affected by the presence of motors and detach from the lattice with the off-rate constant given by Eq. (5) with \u03c6g \u2248 1 and \u03c6e \u2248 0."

            "text": "In the absence of free tubulin a point defect will lead to the loss of more dimers and a hole will expand longitudinally and laterally along the shaft, until the MT breaks completely (i.e., the hole spans over all 13 protofilaments of the MT). We\ndefine as the time to fracture the time between the creation of a single vacancy and the moment the MT separates into two distinct parts. Similarly we define the length of fracture as the longitudinal extension of the hole at the moment of complete MT fracture.\nDue to the lattice anisotropy (longitudinal bonds are assumed to be stronger than lateral bonds), the damaged region will predominantly expand in a longitudinal direction.\nUsing a total typical lattice binding energy of Gb = \u221245kBT [22] and a MT length of 10 \u00b5m corresponding to the approximate length of MTs used in fracture experiments [14], the typical time for the creation of a point defect is of the order of 10 min in the absence of motors and drops, for example, to 3 min in the presence of kinesin motors [\u03c1 = 0.15, \u03b4 = 2 kBT ; see Fig. 3(a)]. Figure 3(b) shows the time to fracture (after creation of a single vacancy) in the presence of fast motors with various energy penalties \u03b4. In the absence of motors, the time to fracture is about 3.5 min. At \u03b4 = 0 motors are stabilizing the lattice and the time to fracture increases compared to the motor-free case. However, a small energy penalty (\u03b4 = 2kBT ) decreases the time to fracture significantly at low motor densities. However, the dependence is nonmonotonous; i.e., at high motor densities the time to fracture is again increasing. Figure 3(c) shows the length of the damaged region in the shaft at fracture. In the absence of motors the typical damage size at fracture is about 6 \u00b5m. In the presence of motors, at \u03b4 = 0 the fracture length increases monotonously, i.e., the damage spreads faster in the longitudinal direction than in the lateral direction, compared to the case without motors. A small energy penalty \u03b4 leads at low motor densities to a small decrease of the fracture length; at high motor densities the fracture length increases. Overall, the energy penalty \u03b4 does not much affect the damage size at fracture. The numerical results (time to fracture, size of damage at fracture) are comparable to experiments (see Fig. 2 in Ref. [14], Supplemental Fig. 4 in Ref. [11]).\nTypically in experiments, the effect of motors on the MT stability of end-stabilized MTs in the absence of free tubulin is presented as survival curves, i.e., the fraction of MTs present depending on time. In these experiments, various effects contribute to the MT destruction besides the nucleation of point defects in the intact shaft. For example, the loss of the stabilizing cap and the subsequent rapid MT depolymerization is a major cause of MT destruction. For pedagogical reasons, although the cap loss is not described in our model, Fig. 3(d) shows survival curves of MTs of 10 \u00b5m length in the presence of fast walking motors with an energy penalty \u03b4 = 2kBT for various motor densities. At low motor densities the curves shift to the left; i.e., motors lead to a faster destruction of MTs as observed experimentally in Ref. [14]. However, at high motor densities MTs have the same stability as in the absence of motors, reflecting the nonmonotonous behavior already evident in Fig. 3(b). Note that the typical time of survival is given by the convoluted sum of the probability distributions for the vacancy nucleation and the increase of the defect size up to complete fracture. Putting in numbers, in the absence of motors, the nucleation time for a vacancy in 10-\u00b5m-long MTs in the absence of motors is \u2248 1\n0.009 1\u00b5m min \u00d710 \u00b5m = 11 min\n[Fig. 3(a), the point where all curves cross the ordinate].\n013012-5\nThe typical time for the damaged region to spread across all protofilaments is about 3.5 min [Fig. 3(b)]. Summing up gives a typical time of survival of 14.5 min, which corresponds to the magenta curve in Fig. 3(d). Doing the same calculation for a motor density of \u03c1 = 0.1 and a penalty of \u03b4 = 2kBT we have a typical vacancy nucleation time of \u2248 1\n0.03 1\u00b5m min \u00d710 \u00b5m =\n3.3 min and a time to complete fracture of about 1.2 min, which gives a typical survival time of 4.5 min corresponding to the orange curve in Fig. 3(d).\nFinally, Fig. 3(e) shows three kymographs of MT fracture in the absence and presence of motors. In the absence of motors, the damage spreads symmetrically in the longitudinal direction. Defect growth in the longitudinal direction is faster than in the lateral direction. The defect growth speed in the longitudinal direction increases with the size of damage in\nthe lateral direction. When the last intact protofilament loses a dimer, fracture is complete. In the presence of (+)-end directed motors the most obvious effect is that the damage spreads faster towards the (\u2212) end than the (+) end, since motors walking towards the point defect are destabilizing the dimers upstream to the existing damage. The downstream side of the damage is not affected by the motors [i.e., the fraction of excited dimers downstream of the damage is vanishing due to a depletion of motors in this region; see Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)]. The difference between the upstream and downstream front propagation of the defect is shown in more detail in Fig. 8. Note also the difference in the timescale on which fracture occurs; for the chosen example motors accelerate fracture two- to threefold compared to the case without motors. In the presence of (\u2212)-end directed motors the damage spreads\n013012-6\nfaster towards the (+) end than the (-) end. For completeness, Fig. 9 shows the equivalent of Figs. 3(a)\u20133(c) for slowly walking (\u2212)-end directed motors.\nIn a final set of calculations we have studied the dynamics of a point defect in the presence of free tubulin dimers at high concentration.\nC. Vacancy dynamics in the presence of free tubulin dimers\nIn the absence of any steric constraints in the lattice, a single point defect will be occupied by a newly incorporated dimer with a typical time \u03c4on = (konc)\u22121 = 0.05 s (for a concentration of free tubulin c = 20 \u00b5M and the kon rate constant given in Table I). Conversely, a GDP dimer sitting next to a vacancy in a longitudinal direction will leave the lattice with a typical time \u03c4off = [k\u2217offe\u03b2( G1+2 G2\u2212 G\n\u2217 )]\u22121 = 3.3 s \u03c4on (see Table I). Therefore, any point defect appearing in the lattice should be closed immediately in the presence of free tubulin, after which the lattice is repaired completely.\nThis picture changes completely if we assume that a GTPtubulin dimer experiences a steric hindrance to incorporate the GDP lattice at a single point defect. Both GMPCPP tubulin (a slowly hydrolyzing analog of GTP tubulin) and GDP tubulin are assumed to adopt a curved conformation in solution albeit with different curvature [47\u201349], which needs to straighten to integrate a tube lattice. A recent kinetic study of the MT tip dynamics [50] proposes a scenario based on steric constraints, where GTP tubulin integrates the MT tip with an energetic preference for a so-called bent conformation to form a sheet structure. Upon GTP hydrolysis the conformation of GDP tubulin shifts towards a straight conformation to close the sheet into a tube structure. In this scenario a GTP tubulin from solution would be in an unfavorable conformation to integrate a point defect in a GDP lattice existing in a straight tube conformation. Furthermore, structural studies [30,51,52] on MT tube structures using analogs for GTP tubulin and slowly hydrolyzing mutant tubulins show a high sensitivity of structural properties of the microtubule (longitudinal and lateral interdimer distances, preferred protofilament number, and lattice skew and twist) with respect to the type of tubulin dimers that form the lattice. Another interesting observation stems from the dynamical behavior of MTs polymerized from mixtures of GTP and GDP tubulins [53,54]. These MTs depolymerize significantly slower than MTs formed from pure GTP tubulin, indicating structural differences between MTs arising from different polymerization conditions.\nHere, in our simple MT-lattice model, we explore the consequences of these structural incompatibilities under the hypothesis that neither GTP tubulin nor GDP tubulin (most probably present in low concentrations in the experiments) can integrate a point defect in a GDP-lattice environment existing in a straight tube conformation [55]. Thereby we consider a point defect with two lateral GDP neighbors as a GDP-lattice environment [see Fig. 4(a)]. This assumption creates a lattice dynamics in the neighborhood of the vacancy, which can potentially survive an extended period of time and lead to localized tubulin exchange experimentally visible in fluorescence microscopy [14\u201316]. Due to the high anisotropy of the lattice the vacancy will perform a random walk predominantly along a single protofilament, i.e., up or\ndown the MT axis. In this mechanism, a longitudinal neighbor of a single point defect will leave the lattice, creating a double point defect allowing a free GTP-tubulin dimer to attach to one of the two vacant sites. After this cycle of detachment and attachment the lattice has again a single point defect.\nFigure 4(b) shows example trajectories over 15 min in the absence of motors, and with (+)- and (\u2212)-end directed destabilizing motors. In the absence of motors, the vacancy dynamics is slow and covers only a small distance on the protofilament 0.25 \u00b5m. The trajectories are mainly diffusive, i.e., \u3008x2\u3009 \u223c t , and get slightly superdiffusive at long times, due to the stabilizing effects of GTP contacts in the lattice and the asymmetry in the GTP hydrolysis [see Figs. 4(b) and 4(c)]. Therefore, the vacancy migrates slowly towards the MT (+) end.\nHowever, in the presence of destabilizing walking motors, the vacancy trajectories are accelerated and become ballistic at long times; i.e., the vacancies are drifting and the meansquared displacement behaves as \u3008x2\u3009 \u223c t2. The drift direction depends on the walking direction of the motors; (+)-end directed motors induce a drift towards the MT (\u2212) end, and (\u2212)-end directed motors induce a drift towards the MT (+) end. Thereby, the dynamics is crucially determined by the following factors: the motor penalty \u03b4 and the off-rate constant of the tubulin dimers immediately upstream or downstream of the point defect (influenced by the dimer fractions \u03c6e and \u03c6g).\nFor a motor penalty \u03b4 = 0 the tubulin dimer situated upstream of the vacancy is slightly stabilized [see Fig. 2(e)]. In the case of the (+)-end directed motor, this small effect reinforces the inherent small bias of the vacancy to drift towards the MT (+) end [increased mean squared displacement (MSD) in Fig. 4(c) for (+)-end directed motors with \u03b4 = 0]. For (\u2212)-end directed motors with \u03b4 = 0, the stabilizing effect by the motors induces a small drift of the vacancy towards the MT (\u2212) end, which is competing with the inherent drift of the vacancy towards the MT (+) end due to GTP hydrolysis [decreased MSD in Fig. 4(c) for (\u2212)-end directed motors with \u03b4 = 0].\nAs an illustration Fig. 4(d) shows example kymographs of tubulin exchange, where dimers directly incorporated into the shaft are shown in yellow. Figure 4(e) shows the length of incorporation spots depending on the motor concentration and energy penalty \u03b4 for fast (+)-end directed and slow (\u2212)-end directed motors. Without motors at \u03c1 = 0 the incorporation length is about 0.25 \u00b5m. Without motor walk induced penalty (\u03b4 = 0) this length barely changes. However, at a small penalty of \u03b4 = 1kBT (fast motors) the incorporation length increases to about 1 \u00b5m at high motor density (\u03c1 = 0.2). For \u03b4 = 2kBT (fast motors) the incorporation length increases strongly with the motor density. Even at a low motor density (\u03c1 = 0.02) the incorporation length is about 1 \u00b5m. Slow motors have a similar effect as fast motors, albeit at higher energy penalties \u03b4. For comparison, in experiments the incorporation length after 7\u201340 min of tubulin incorporation with kinesins (fast motors in our model) is approximately 1 \u00b5m [14\u201316].\nSo far, we have investigated a vacancy dynamics without considering possible repair mechanisms, which could lead to the closure of a point defect. As a weak assumption we\n013012-7\ncould postulate that a lateral GTP-tubulin dimer adjacent to a vacancy allows for the incorporation of a free GTP-tubulin dimer, since the GTP dimer already present in the lattice sufficiently extends the vacancy site to allow for a GTP dimer to incorporate. In this picture, a point defect repairs completely, as soon as a vacancy loses a lateral GDP-dimer neighbor. In the absence of motors, the typical lifetime of a point defect is then given by \u03c4L = [k\u2217offe\u03b2(2 G1+ G2\u2212 G\n\u2217 )]\u22121 = 100 min, well beyond the observation time in an experiment. In the presence of destabilizing walking motors, the lifetime may shorten considerably [cf. Fig. 2(d)]. For example, an effective increase in the off-rate constant for a lateral dimer by a factor of 3 [Fig. 2(d), \u03c1 = 0.15, \u03b4 = 2kBT ] reduces the lifetime of the vacancy to 100/3 min = 33 min, which is comparable to the experimental timescale.\nA second potential repair mechanism of point defects could result from relaxing the rule of steric constraint for the inclusion of free tubulin at point defects, i.e., allowing for an on-rate constant \u223c\u03b6kon with \u03b6 1. Repair would then be complete with a typical time \u223c1/(\u03b6kon)."

            "text": "In the present paper we have theoretically explored a possible mechanism for MT lattice plasticity in the presence of processive molecular motors. Our basic idea is that the motor walk transiently, locally, and weakly destabilizes the underlying MT lattice, which increases the rate of tubulin dimer loss from the shaft lattice. Assuming a steric hindrance for GTP-tubulin dimers to integrate a single vacancy in the\n013012-8\nGDP lattice induces a lattice dynamics at the vacancy which is accelerated by molecular motors. Furthermore, the vacancy dynamics switches from diffusive to ballistic in the presence of motors whereby the direction of motion depends on the direction of the motor walk.\nThe proposed model mechanism matches qualitatively and quantitatively fracture experiments (fracture size and time to fracture) of end-stabilized MTs in the absence of free tubulin dimers. It is also consistent with experiments on endstabilized MTs in the presence of free tubulin dimers, which show an increase in the frequency of free dimer incorporation spots with typical sizes of about 1 \u00b5m.\nFrequencies of incorporation spots have been measured by two different groups and vary considerably. Andreu-Carb\u00f3 et al. [16] measured a frequency of 0.05 \u00b5m\u22121 after 15 min of free tubulin incorporation in the absence of motors. In the presence of kinesins (5 nM), the frequency increased to 0.2 \u00b5m\u22121, which is consistent with defect nucleation rates shown in Fig. 3(a). In contrast, Triclin et al. [14] measured frequencies of 0.017 \u00b5m\u22121 after 40 min of free tubulin incorporation in the absence of motors. In the presence of kinesins (10 nM), the frequency of incorporation increased to 0.05 \u00b5m\u22121, which is lower by a factor of 4 than the frequency measured by Andreu-Carb\u00f3 et al. [16] at much shorter incubation times. While the absolute frequency of incorporation may depend on the sensitivity of the experimental setup, both groups find an increase in the incorporation frequency in the presence of motors by a factor of 3 to 4 compared to the control experiment, which corresponds in our model to a motor penalty of about 2kBT or slightly above for low kinesin densities on the MT.\nA recent paper by Th\u00e9ry and Blanchoin [56] speculates about possible mechanisms of interaction between the processive motor walk and the underlying MT lattice. They juxtapose two different concepts: the motor facilitates the lattice dynamics at dislocations (e.g., changes in protofilament numbers) (termed the \u201cpickpocket\u201d and \u201cburglar\u201d concept, respectively) as opposed to the idea that the motor weakly destabilizes the perfect lattice in its wake (termed the \u201croadburner\u201d). In the first case, the motor walk acts on existing defects, which were created during polymerization. In the latter case, the motor continuously and weakly perturbs the lattice which leads to the nucleation of vacancies.\nHere we have investigated the \u201croad-burner\u201d concept where MT shaft plasticity is enhanced as a collective motor effect; the motor walk weakly destabilizes the MT lattice on an energy scale of a few kBT and facilitates detachment of dimers from the lattice. The dynamics of an existing vacancy is greatly accelerated upstream of the motor current, whereas downstream of the vacancy the lattice is devoid of motors, leading to a vacancy drift in a direction opposite of the walking direction. Both concepts (i.e., motors act on existing defects and nucleate new defects) are not mutually exclusive and could act in an additive manner. However, the road-burner concept (de novo nucleation) would increase the number of sites of lattice plasticity depending on the motor density present on the MT [16], offering a true mechanism of MT regulation.\nAn important feature in motor-induced MT lattice dynamics is the motor behavior at lattice vacancies. In the\nhere proposed model mechanism, motor-stimulated dimer removal upstream of vacancies requires a sufficiently high motor flux. In our simulations we had only considered motors which walk on single protofilaments and detach rapidly at the vacancy. However, especially dyneins are known to sidestep frequently. In the vicinity of vacancies this might be an important alternative mechanism to maintain a high motor flux and reduce jamming upstream of the vacancy.\nIt was suggested in Ref. [21] that the walk of a single kinesin is sufficient to directly remove dimers from the MT shaft as a rare event. Indeed, the experiments in Ref. [21] show that the cooperative action of several kinesins may be able to remove a tubulin dimer from the lattice by pulling on the dimer via a flexible tether, although a direct proof of dimer removal is missing. Within this concept of direct dimer removal, the motor walk facilitates vacancy nucleation, as an extremely rare event. It is not clear how the motors affect the lattice in the vicinity of the vacancy, since this would require that a rare lattice destabilization event occurs at an existing vacancy. A direct dimer removal offers therefore no straightforward explanation for micrometer-sized tubulin incorporation spots, which involve an exchange of several tens to 100 dimers length. However, the direct detachment of tubulin dimers by the kinesin walk as a rare event can be treated potentially within the same kinetic Monte Carlo framework we have used here. To that end, only an almost vanishing small fraction of motor steps leads to a strong transient lattice destabilization (limited by the free energy of ATP hydrolysis). An investigation of this \u201csingle-molecule\u201d mechanism with respect to MT fracture and free tubulin incorporation is part of future work in an attempt to oppose the two mechanisms of motor-lattice interactions.\nIt has been speculated that GTP islands in the GDP shaft may serve as rescue sites for rapidly depolymerizing MTs and thus an increased tubulin turnover in the shaft may entail an increased MT stability. Indeed, it has been shown in vivo and in vitro that an increased frequency of tubulin exchange sites correlates with a higher rescue frequency [16,57,58]. Increasing the stability of dynamic MTs by increasing the MT shaft plasticity constitutes a completely novel and unexplored mechanism of MT regulation, of which a mechanistic picture is completely missing. Our proposed mechanism for MTmotor interactions could serve as an important cornerstone in plasticity-induced MT regulatory mechanisms.\nData and source codes for Figs. 2(a)\u20132(e), 3(a)\u20133(d), 4(b), 4(c), 4(e), 5, 7(a)\u20137(e), 8, and 9(a)\u20139(c) are available on the Zenodo repository [59]."

Statistical analysis (averages, standard deviations, and standard errors of the mean) was either performed using C, PYTHON, or R. Unless stated otherwise, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the parameters shown in Table I.\na. Details of the seam structure. Individual lattice sites on the square lattice are identified by a doublet of integers (i, j). Lattice sites at the seam have two nearest lateral \u201chalf\u201d neighbors across the seam; that is, dimers at the seam in Fig. 1(a) with the doublet (1, j) are in contact with dimers (13, j + 2) and (13, j + 1) at the opposite site of the seam and dimers at the right seam with doublet (13, j) are in contact with dimers (1, j \u2212 \u22121) and (1, j \u2212 \u22122) for a 133 protofilament lattice. Each lateral dimer-dimer contact across the seam is counted with a binding energy G2/2; i.e., in the fully occupied lattice, dimers at the seam have the same binding energy as dimers in the bulk lattice.\nb. Principle of detailed balance for reversible reactions. For the passive process of lattice polymerization and depolymerization, the principle of detailed balance has to hold.\nTherefore, on- and off-rate constants, kon and koff , must be coupled by the relation [61]\nkoff konc0 = e\u03b2 G, (A1)\nwhere \u03b2\u22121 = kBT , c0 denotes the standard concentration of free tubulin in solution, that is, 1 M by convention, and G denotes the change in free energy upon transferring a free dimer from the solution into the lattice. Note that c0 in Eq. (A1) is not the actual concentration of the free tubulin in solution, but the standard concentration, and originates from the concentration dependence of the chemical potential, that is, kBT ln(c/c0), where c denotes the actual concentration of free tubulin in solution. G = Gb + Ge + \u03b4 contains contributions from binding of the dimer to nearest neighbors Gb, the loss of entropy due to immobilization of the free dimer in the lattice Ge, and an additional (weak) transient contribution \u03b4 due to the stepping of processive motors. We rewrite Eq. (A1) into\nkoff = konc0e\u03b2 G = k\u2217off e\u03b2( Gb+\u03b4\u2212 G \u2217 ) (A2)\nwith k\u2217off = konc0e\u03b2( Ge+ G \u2217 ). G\u2217 = G1 + GT1 + G2 denotes the binding energy at the microtubule tip with a GTP cap (i.e., the binding energy of a GTP dimer with one lateral and one longitudinal GTP-dimer neighbor).\nc. Justification for the choice of GT1 . Note that the stabilization of longitudinal T-T contacts is a major difference from the model by vanBuren et al. [22], but permits to capture the dynamic instability without further assumptions. The stabilization of only lateral T-T contacts is not sufficient to induce a dynamic instability with sufficiently long phases of growth and shrinkage.\nd. Motor dynamics with occasional backward steps. Figures 7(a) and 7(c) show results for the steady fractions of excited and ground-state dimers which can leave the lattice, \u03c6e and \u03c6g for slow motors which may occasionally step backwards. These simulations were carried out under the assumption that the motor walks with a mean speed \u3008v\u3009 = 10\u03c4\u22121. The rate constant for doing a forward step is given by kw,f 1\u2212\u03be 1\u22122\u03be \u3008v\u3009 and the backward-stepping rate constant is kw,b \u03be\n1\u22122\u03be \u3008v\u3009. \u03be denotes the fraction of backward steps which is 0.2 in the simulations in Figs. 6(a) and\n6(c). The mean velocity \u3008v\u3009 is related to kw,f and kw,b by \u3008v\u3009 = kw,f \u2212 kw,b.\ne. Motor dynamics in the mean-field approximation. Typically, simulations were carried out for a given quasi-steadystate motor density at the intact lattice (i.e., the temporal average of the probability that a motor front head is attached to a tubulin dimer after all transients have decayed). In this situation, the motor (front head) density is related to the motor onrate constant k+ and the motor off-rate constant k\u2212 [27,37] by\n0 = k+ (1 \u2212 2\u03c1) 2\n1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 k\u2212\u03c1. (A3)\nFor a given \u03c1 and motor off-rate constant k\u2212, Eq. (A3) determines the motor on-rate constant k+. The microtubule lattice was initiated with all tubulin dimers in the ground state and with a mean motor density \u2248 \u03c1. Statistical measures of the lattice dynamics in the presence of motors were recorded after a short period of equilibration \u223c10k\u22121\u2212 .\n013012-11\nf. Motor-lattice interactions in the quasi-steady-state approach. The computational effort of the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model presented in the Model section in the main text increases rapidly with the employed motor density since the system dynamics is driven by two different timescales. On the one hand, the tubulin dynamics [k\u22121off ( G\n\u2217) = 1 s] is slow, and on the other hand, the motor dynamics (k\u22121w = 0.1\u2013 0.01 s) is one to two orders of magnitude faster. It is then a prerequisite to optimize the KMC algorithm to minimize the computational time. One can either reduce the total number of reactions needed to simulate the system (i.e., reduce the complexity of the model) or increase the number of reactions\nper second (i.e., optimize the script algorithm). Some of the simulations (MT fracture) were done with a sharp reduction in the complexity (i.e., the number of considered reactions), using a quasi-steady-state assumption to capture the effect of the motor walk on the lattice stability. To that end we tabulated the steady-state fractions of dimers in the excited and ground states (\u03c6e, \u03c6g) that are able to leave the lattice; i.e., they are not blocked by the presence of motors bound to two dimers. Thereby we considered two cases. In case I the motors move on an intact protofilament with translational symmetry and the steady states are given by (\u03c6e, \u03c6g) = (\u03c6e,i, \u03c6g,i ). In case II, we considered a protofilament containing a point defect and\n013012-12\ntabulated (\u03c6e,u, \u03c6g,u) and (\u03c6e,d, \u03c6g,d) for the dimers immediately upstream and downstream of the defect, respectively. For simulations of MT fracture we then used the tabulated doublets of (\u03c6e, \u03c6g) to define effective off-rate constants using Eq. (5) for dimers that are nearest neighbors to vacant lattice sites using the following rules. Dimers upstream and downstream of the defect detach with the rate constants koff,eff,u and koff,eff,g, respectively,\nkoff,eff,u = ( \u03c6e,ue \u03b2\u03b4 + \u03c6g,u ) k\u2217offe \u2212\u03b2 Gb, (A4) koff,eff,d = ( \u03c6e,de \u03b2\u03b4 + \u03c6g,d ) k\u2217offe \u2212\u03b2 Gb, (A5)\nwith Gb = G1 + n G2 with n = (0, 1, 2) determined by the lattice environment. For dimers which are lateral neighbors of the defect and experience an unperturbed motor flow the off-rate constant koff,eff,i is given by\nkoff,eff,i = ( \u03c6e,ie \u03b2\u03b4 + \u03c6g,i ) k\u2217offe \u2212\u03b2 Gb (A6)\nwith Gb = 2 G1 + n2 G2 with n = (0, 1, 2, 3) determined by the lattice environment. Dimers which are missing one lateral and two longitudinal neighbors detach almost instantaneously from the lattice; the excitation state of the dimer is negligible for the lattice dynamics. We did not consider the detachment of dimers without a vacant neighbor site. Using full KMC simulations (simulating the motor dynamics explicitly) we checked that the distribution of dimer detachment times k\u22121off is exponential.\n013012-13\n[1] M.-F.

Therefore, the detachment of GTP dimers from the GDP lattice has to be affected in the same manner as the attachment process. For GDP tubulin we assume an irreversible relaxation upon detachment from the lattice from the straight to the curved conformation, preventing any reattachment.\n[56] M. Th\u00e9ry and L.
