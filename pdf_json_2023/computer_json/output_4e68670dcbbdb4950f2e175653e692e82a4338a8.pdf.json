    "abstractText": "It is a continual and challenging problem to detect small defects in metallic structures for array eddy current testing (ECT) probes, which require the probe to have ultra-high resolution and sensitivity. However, the spatial resolution of an ECT array probe is limited by the size of the induction coils. Even if it is possible to increase the spatial resolution by using smaller coils, the sensitivity of the sensor also decreases. To obtain finer spatial resolution without sacrificing sensitivity, this paper proposes a resolution enhanced ECT array probe with four rows of coils attached to a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB). The distance between each two adjacent coils in a row is 2 mm and the position of each row is offset by 0.5 mm along the horizontal direction related to its prior row. The outputs of the four rows are aligned and interpolated in a line, and in this way the image resolution of the probe is increased to 0.5 mm. The probe is configured to operate with the differential setting, namely two differential coils operate simultaneously at each time. The currents in the two coils can be controlled to have the same flowing direction or opposite flowing direction, resulting in different distributions of the induced eddy current and two sets of output images. A patch-image model and an image fusion method based on discrete wavelet transforms are employed to suppress the noise and highlight the defects\u2019 indications. Experimental results show that small defects with dimensions as small as length \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth = 1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.3 mm on a 304 stainless-steel sample can be detected from the fused image, demonstrating that the probe has super sensitivity for small defects inspection.",

            "text": "It is essential to inspect defects in critical industrial structures, such as nuclear power plants, transportation, aviation, petrochemical plants, etc. Non-destructive testing (NDT) technologies aim at evaluating materials/structures for characterizing differences and defects without causing damage to the objects under test [1,2]. The earlier a defect is identified, the less damage it can cause, which will save a lot of time and cost. However, the inspection of small defects on metal surfaces efficiently and economically is still a problem to be studied [3]. To inspect small defects, it is required that the inspection system has ultra-high resolution and sensitivity. Different kinds of technologies, such as magnetic particle inspection, penetrant inspection, ultrasonic inspection, X-ray inspection, machine vision inspection and eddy current testing (ECT) can be employed for defects inspection [4\u20136]. Magnetic particle inspection and penetrant inspection methods are widely used NDT technologies. The visualization of the test results and the maturity of the testing system are their main advantages. However, for these technologies, it is difficult to realize automatic inspection [7\u20139]. X-ray detection methods have high accuracy and high inspection efficiency. The state-of-the-art X-ray inspection systems have the resolution at fine micron-level. The main drawbacks of an X-ray inspection system are: (i) the equipment is typically expensive and has large volume\nSensors 2023, 23, 2070. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23042070 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 2070 2 of 14\nand (ii) it has radiological risk [10,11]. Acoustic microscopy is a kind of microscopy that employs very high-frequency ultrasound. Scanning acoustic microscopes (SAMs) can achieve resolutions in the micron range [12,13]. However, most acoustic inspection requires couplant and it requires careful preparation of the surface under test. Visual inspection with abundant processing algorithms is a popular surface inspection method, which has the advantages of being non-contact, fast and high-resolution. However, the influences such as shooting angle and lighting conditions in machine vision detection result in varying quality of the collected images, which affect the image processing and the accuracy of detection [14\u201316]. Eddy current testing (ECT) has the advantages of being non-contact, low-cost, fast and high resolution [17,18]. It is widely used to examine the structure of conductive materials to identify their structural integrity [19]. For ECT probes with a single pickup coil/sensor, a complex scanning path should be employed to cover an area, which makes the inspection inefficient [20]. Array probes with multiple receivers can obtain a C-scan image in a linear scan [21,22]. The incessant development of array probes has also led to an increase in detection accuracy. Machado et al. designed geometric array probes on a printed circuit board (PCB), which can detect small defects [23]. Liu et al. designed a null-offset planar eddy current sensor array to solve the problem of low resolution in the detection of buried defects in metallic materials [24]. Fan et al. improved the sensitivity of the array probe for crack identification by changing the space between the excitation coil and the sensing coil, and pasting the permalloy film on one side of the sensor [25]. Ma et al. combined the excitation of both windings with a multi-detection flexible array for crack detection [26]. Yusa et al. designed a uniform eddy current arrayed probe consisting of a large rectangular parallelepiped excitation coil and arrayed pancake pick-up coils [27]. Array ECT probes that are composed of magnetically coupled pancake coils and work with a transmit-receive configuration were widely used for plate and cylinder structure inspection [28]. A flexible probe with in-plane differential coils was proposed by Ye et al. The sensitivity of the probe for defects in different directions was increased by fusing images [29]. However, all the current probes have limited spatial resolution because of the restriction of the size of the pick-up coils. To detect small defects, the spatial resolution of the output images needs to be enhanced. Identifying defects from the testing images utilizing proper algorithms is another important aspect of ECT. A continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and adaptive thresholding algorithms were employed simultaneously in [28]. An adaptive second-generation wavelet transform was utilized in [30] to reduce the noise. Buck et al. used artificial neural network (ANN) with the statistical technique of principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the defect detection performance [31]. Postolache et al. utilized ANN, including competitive neural network and multilayer perceptron to improve the accuracy of defect classification [32]. Morabito et al. studied fuzzy inference and fuzzy curves with a simplified set of features [33]. Gao et al. modeled low-rank and sparse decompositions in an alternating manner. By combining low-rank information into the sparse matrix, small defects were recognized more effectively [34]. Tao et al. preprocessed ECT image with spatial domain filtering and gradient feature edge extraction and then used a deep neural network-based target detection algorithm called mask-region convolutional neural network (Mask-RCNN) [35]. This paper presents an array probe, which enhances the image resolution by interpolating data from different rows of sensors. In addition, a patch-image model is utilized to suppress the noise and an image fusion method based on discrete wavelet transforms is employed to further improve the image quality. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the design and operating principle of the probe. Then, Section 3 presents the experiment setup. Next, Section 4 presents the image processing algorithm and the results. Finally, Section 5 discusses the conclusion and future work of the study.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2070 3 of 14"

It is seen from Figure 12 that the indications of defects #4-#6 are weak. To show these defects more clearly, the zoom-in plots are presented in Figure 13. It is seen that all the defects have indications in the figures. However, there are some noises, some of which have a si ilar magnitude as the small defects\u2019 signal, such as the noises n1 and n2 shown in Figure 13. Fortunately, the noise signals are not presented in the images of different modes consistently. For example, the noise n1 appears in the OD mode image, but it is not significant in the SD mode image. Similarly, n2 is presented in the SD mode image but not in the OD mode image. Meanwhile, the defects\u2019 signals are presented in both modes. Given this characteristic, an image fusion method is employe to further suppr ss th noise and highlight the i dications o the small defects.\nFigure 12.

The flowchart of the algorithm is shown in Figure 14. The input images are the preprocessed figures, namely S1 and O1. The image fusion algorithm is written as (9). First, the Mallat algorithm is employed to decompose the input images into four components, including low frequency (CA), horizontal high frequency (CH), vertical high frequency (CV) and diagonal high frequency (CD). Next, the absolute value of each component is minimized.

However, there re some nois s, some of which have a similar magnitude as t small defects\u2019 signal, such as the noises n1 and n2 shown\nSensors 2023, 23, 2070 10 of 14\nin Figure 13. Fortunately, the noise signals are not presented in the images of different modes consistently. For example, the noise n1 appears in the OD mode image, but it is not significant in the SD mode image. Similarly, n2 is presented in the SD mode image but not in the OD mode image. Meanwhile, the defects\u2019 signals are presented in both modes. Given this characteristic, an image fusion method is employed to further suppress the noise and highlight the indications of the small defects.

Flowchart of the image fusion.\nThe fused images of the defects are drawn in Figure 15. Here, the images of defects #1-#3 and #4-#6 are plotted separately to show the defects\u2019 signal more clearly. It is seen that the noise is further suppressed by the image fusion. If a proper threshold value is applied, for example 31 10\u2212\u00d7 V, which is one-tenth of the maximum defect signal, all the defects can be reliably detected from the fused image. The signal-to-noise ratio of defect #5 is further improved from 28.99 dB to 50.10 dB. It is worth noting that the defects are very small; for instance, the dimensions of defect #6 are only 1 mm (length) \u00d7 0.1 mm (width) \u00d7 0.3 mm (depth). It is challenging for conventional array ECT probes to detect such a small defect. The excellent defect indications in the fused image demonstrate that the method developed in this paper has super sensitivity for small defects inspection. The proposed probe is compared with a state-of-the-art ECT probe [44]. The reference probe consists of two rows of coils. The inner and outer diameters of the coils are 0.5 mm and 2.6 mm, respectively. The probe works in transmit\u2013receive mode, e.g., at each time, a coil carrying AC current is activated as a transmitter, and three other coils are selected as receivers picking up the magnetic field. Due to the different positions of the pick-up coils related to the excitation coil, two channel images, namely vertical channel and horizontal channel, are obtained by the reference probe in an inspection, which is more sensitive to vertical defect and horizontal defects, respectively. The same sample was tested by the probe and the excitation frequency was kept identical to the previous experiment (600 kHz). The horizontal channel images of the reference probe after signal processing are shown in Figure 16. As the horizontal channel images of the reference probe are not as sensitive to the vertical defects as they are to the horizontal defects, it is reasonable that\nFigure 13.

The flowchart of the algorithm is shown in Figure 14. The input images are the preprocessed figures, namely S1 and O1. The image fusion algorithm is written as (9). First, the Mallat algorithm is employed to decompose the input images into four components, including low frequency (CA), horizontal high frequency (CH), vertical high frequency (CV) and diagonal high frequency (CD). Next, the absolute value of each component is minimized. Finally, the fused wavelet coefficients are inverted using an inverse wavelet transform to produce the final fused image F.\nF = \u03c9\u22121(min(|\u03c9(S1)|, |\u03c9(O1)|)) (9)\nwhere\u03c9 is a wavelet transform and\u03c9\u22121 is an inverse wavelet transform [43].\nSensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 15\nn1\nn1\nn2\nn2\n(a )\n(b )\n#4\n#4\n#5\n#5\n#6\n#6\ny(mm)\no u\ntp u\nt v\no lt\nag e(\nV )\no u\ntp u\nt v\no lt\nag e(\nV ) y(mm)\nFigure 13.

Conclusions This paper presents a resolution enhanced ECT array probe without sacrificing sensitivity. The outputs of the four rows are aligned and interpolated in a line during the signal processing, and in this way the image resolution is increased to 0.5 mm. Two coils of the probe operate simultaneously and are configured as in-plane differential measurements at the same time, so as to suppress the background signal and common mode noises. Simulation results showed that the probe has a similar sensitivity for horizontal defects and demonstrated the necessity of increasing the spatial resolution. Experimental results showed that the resolution enhanced image has better defect indications. A patchimage model and an image fusion method based on discrete wavelet transforms were utilized to enhance the contrast and remove noise interference. All the defects, including a small defect with dimensions as small as length \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth = 1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.3 mm, can be detected, which demonstrates that the method developed in this paper has\nsuper sensitivity for small defects.
