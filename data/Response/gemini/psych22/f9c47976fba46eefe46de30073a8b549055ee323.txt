1. **Investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving emotion regulation skills and reducing neuroticism traits in mitigating psychological distress during pandemics.** This could involve conducting randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of different interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and acceptance and commitment therapy, in reducing psychological distress in individuals with high neuroticism traits or difficulties with emotion regulation.


2. **Examine the role of social support in moderating the relationship between personality traits, emotion regulation skills, and psychological distress during pandemics.** This could involve conducting longitudinal studies to investigate how social support from family, friends, and community members can buffer the negative effects of high neuroticism traits and difficulties with emotion regulation on psychological distress during pandemics.


3. **Explore the impact of different types of pandemic-related stressors on psychological distress in individuals with different personality traits and emotion regulation skills.** This could involve conducting studies to compare the effects of different stressors, such as job loss, financial insecurity, social isolation, and fear of infection, on psychological distress in individuals with different personality traits and emotion regulation skills.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of pandemics on personality traits and emotion regulation skills.** This could involve conducting longitudinal studies to examine how personality traits and emotion regulation skills change over time in individuals who have experienced a pandemic, and how these changes are associated with psychological distress.


5. **Develop and validate screening tools to identify individuals at risk for psychological distress during pandemics based on their personality traits and emotion regulation skills.** This could involve conducting studies to identify the most effective predictors of psychological distress during pandemics and developing screening tools that can be used to identify individuals who are at risk for developing psychological problems.
