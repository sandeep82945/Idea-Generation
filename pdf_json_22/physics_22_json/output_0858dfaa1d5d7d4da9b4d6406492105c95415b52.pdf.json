    "abstractText": "We describe the optimum telescope focal ratio for a two-element, three surface, telecentric image-transfer microlens-to-fiber coupled integral field unit within the constraints imposed by micro-optics fabrication and optical aberrations. We create a generalized analytical description of the micro-optics optical parameters from first principals. We find that the optical performance, including all aberrations, of a design constrained by an analytic model considering only spherical aberration and diffraction matches within \u00b14% of a design optimized by raytracing software such as Zemax. The analytical model does not require any compromise on the available clear aperture; about 90% mechanical aperture of a hexagonal microlens is available for light collection. The optimum telescope f-ratio for a 200\u03bcm core fiber fed at f/3.5 is between f/7 and f/12. We find the optimum telescope focal ratio changes as a function of fiber core diameter and fiber input beam speed. A telescope focal ratio of f/8 would support the largest range of fiber diameters (100 to 500\u03bcm) and fiber injection speeds (between f/3 and f/5). The optimization of telescope and lenslet-coupled fibers is relevant for the design of high-efficiency dedicated survey telescopes, and for retro-fitting existing facilities via introducing focal macro-optics to match the instrument input requirements.",

We create a generalized analytical description of the micro-optics optical parameters from first principals. We find that the optical performance, including all aberrations, of a design constrained by an analytic model considering only spherical aberration and diffraction matches within \u00b14% of a design optimized by raytracing software such as Zemax. The analytical model does not require any compromise on the available clear aperture; about 90% mechanical aperture of a hexagonal microlens is available for light collection. The optimum telescope f-ratio for a 200\u00b5m core fiber fed at f/3.5 is between f/7 and f/12. We find the optimum telescope focal ratio changes as a function of fiber core diameter and fiber input beam speed. A telescope focal ratio of f/8 would support the largest range of fiber diameters (100 to 500\u00b5m) and fiber injection speeds (between f/3 and f/5). The optimization of telescope and lenslet-coupled fibers is relevant for the design of high-efficiency dedicated survey telescopes, and for retro-fitting existing facilities via introducing focal macro-optics to match the instrument input requirements.\nKeywords: Integral Field Spectroscopy; Microlens-Fiber IFU; Microlens Optical Design: Telescope f-ratio..\n* Further author information: (Send correspondence to Sabysachi Chattopadhyay) E-mail: sabyasachi@saao.ac.za, Telephone: +27 78 298 6850"

            "text": "Modern day spectroscopic surveys employ collecting apertures running from 10m-class telescopes (VIRUS[1, 2], PFS[3], MSE[4]), to modest 4m-class telescopes (e.g. DESI[5], 4MOST[6]), down to even a few hundred mm (LVM[7]). At the heart of each of these surveys is fiberoptic coupled spectroscopy. Fiber optics serve as a convenient bridge between the mobile telescope system and the more stable spectrograph mounts, as well as a image reformatting system from the telescope focal plane to spectrograph entrance slit. While Galactic and extragalactic surveys have traditionally employed single fibers to multiplex redshift and spectral diagnostic measurements of stars, distant galaxies and quasars, more recently there has been an additional focus on mapping resolved sources (nearby galaxies and Galactic nebulae) using integral-field spectroscopy (IFS). In general, fiber-fed IFS (IFUs; e.g., SparsePak[8], PPak[9], VIRUS-P[1], VIRUS-W[2], MaNGA[10], and MEGARA[11]) are flexible, cost-effective and suitable for optical and near IR wavelengths. Fibers also lend themselves well to multi-object IFS of distributed and/or extended sources contained in large (often many deg2) telescope fields of view (e.g., SAMI[12] on the 4m AAT and MaNGA[13] on the 2.5m Sloan Telescope). Consequently fiber-fed IFS remains an appealing approach along side other flavours of IFS (e.g., image-slicing with SPHERE[14], MUSE[15] and KMOS[16] on VLT, or KCWI[17] on Keck).\nDespite fiber optics being a popular and cost-effective mode of coupling telescopes to spectrographs, fibers are well-known to degrade the input focal-ratio upon output. This focal ratio degradation (FRD) via stepped index, multi-mode fibers[18, 19, 20] affects the efficiency of\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n08 76\n4v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .I\nM ]\n1 9\nA pr\n2 02\n2\nobservation because it is in essence an injection of entropy into the information gathering system. It is observed [21, 22] that the effect of FRD can be minimized by injecting a faster beam into the fiber.\nA contemporary measurement of this effect is illustrated in Figure 1 using a differential reimaging system similar to [8, 10, 23]. The focal ratio degradation was measured for a 2-m length of 400\u00b5m diameter core step-index, broad-band fiber (MOLEX/Polymicro FBP 400:440:470) fed with a centered, reimaged near-field spot of 100\u00b5m in diameter. The input focal ratio was varied by changing the aperture of an intermediate pupil-stop. The output focal ratio was measured at a radius covering 98% of the normalized encircled energy. The salient feature of this measurement was that it was performed with a well-aligned inject beam, telecentric to within 0.1\u25e6 in tip/tilt similar to that of [23]. The upper limit on the angular deviation limits geometric FRD (gFRD) to no faster than f/286; over the range of injection speeds this is inconsequential. While the left hand panel of Figure 1 shows the well-known non-linear \u2018saturation\u2019 of the output beam speed, in the right panel we present the same measurements as a ratio of out vs input solid angle. This has a simple, linear behavior with input numerical aperture from which entropy gain due to fiber FRD can be easily estimated. The qualitative behavior motivates why present-day fiber-coupled spectrographs tend to have faster collimators (see the references above).\nIt is also the case that for IFS using bare, densely packed circular fibers, the fill factor is typically only 60% [10] given the inherent geometry plus the minimum requirements for cladding and mechanical buffer. Some gains can be had by removing the buffer and lightly fusing the fibers, but is technically challenging and comes at the cost of more FRD [24]. Consequently, it is often desirable to couple fibers to the telescope focal plane via lenslet arrays. One purpose of lenslet coupling is to increase the fill-factor of the fiber array. In principle, circular lenslets with hexagonal packing or hexagonal lenslets with circular chromium coating can increase the fill-factor up to 90%. We consider this lenslet geometry in this paper. However, when coupling lenslets to fibers, a further challenge arises: The clear aperture in a micro-lens system falls quickly compared to the available mechanical aperture with faster input beams from telescope\n[25, 26]. Thus in an effort to reduce FRD one would struggle to attain an acceptable fill factor on sky [25].\nThe aim of this study is to resolve the tension between the optimum input focal ratios for lenslet and fiber optics. This is part of the broader question i.e. given a survey being planned, either using an existing telescope or a new telescope, what would be the ideal telescope focal ratio at the input of the microlens for a set of fiber input speed, fiber diameter and fabricable microlens properties. To do so we develop a generic analytical description of an image transfer IFU optical model to optimize the telescope focal ratio within the constraints posed by the microlens array fabrication. We assume the spectrograph design accommodates a fast fiber output beam or, alternatively, uses additional microlenses at the output end of the fiber to modulate the speed of the spectrograph collimator. We start in Section 2 by describing the optical parameters of an image transfer IFU system and the parameter space available for optimization given fabrication limitations and FRD. In Section 3 we describe the analytical model to define the IFU optical parameters. Following sections discuss two distinct regimes where on-axis aberrations are either dominated by diffraction or spherical aberration (SA) (Section 4) and the design choices that minimize light loss from aberrations in general (Section 5). We confirm the reliability of our model compared to ray-trace calculations in the non-diffractionlimited regime in Section 5 as well. In Section 6 we describe the acceptable range of telescope beam speed defined by the fabrication limits. Section 7 summarizes our results and presents our conclusions.\nThe result of our analysis calls for much slower telescope beams than developed for telescopes optimized for bare-fiber feeds, such as HET and SALT, which are close to f/4. The optimum telescope f-ratio we find is closer to f/8, although in detail we will show this depends on the fiber core diameter. The optimum f-ratio can be achieved on an existing telescope via a macro-focal reducer or expander [27, 28, 29]. However, for a dedicated survey facility we suggest optimizing the native telescope beam speed to minimize the total number of optical elements [30, 31]."

            "text": "We describe telecentric reimaging (or image-relay) microlens systems in this paper, and note differences with pupil-transfer microlens systems below. The basic optical concept is to reimage the focal plane on to the fiber cores through a set of two MLAs. Conceptually, the first MLA elements act as field lenses while the second produces telecentric images. In practice, to optimize image quality the optics deviate slightly from this idealized prescription [see for example VIRUS2 design and Section 5 here][32]. A bi-convex MLA (BC) with appropriate radius of curvature (RoC) and thickness creates a pupil at its exit surface, and the exit beam is collimated for all field points. A suitable gap (depending on the RoC of the second MLA) of the BC and plano-convex MLA (PC) ensures a telecentric image at the flat back surface of the PC.\nOne of the free design parameter is the micro-image size at the input of the fiber. However, in our previous study [26], we found that the micro-image diameter should be \u223c97% of the fiber core diameter in order to minimize e\u0301tendue gain. Thus the fiber core diameter and microimage diameter are used interchangably in our analysis. To maximize grasp (area\u2013solid-angle product, or A\u2126), the ideal micro-image diameter (dm) should be equal to the diameter of the fiber core. However, due to fiber positioning and alignment issues dm needs to be smaller than fiber core. Based on our own photo-lithographic work and comparison to commercially\navailable products we estimate current technology permits fibers to be positioned within\u00b13 \u00b5m RMS at any desired spacing[26].\nFigure 2 illustrates a typical image-relay microlens system where telescope light is fed at a focal ratio of ftel. This beam enters the bi-convex microlens with rb radius of curvature, Db thickness, and da clear aperture. The thickness is defined such that the beam forms its pupil at the exit surface of the bi-convex microlens. The pupil is then focused to an image plane via a plano-convex lens with rp radius of curvature and Dp thickness, sitting at a distance of DG from the bi-convex lens. Dp and the beam diameter of the central field defines the injected fratio (ffib) into the fiber. Since the pupil is positioned at the exit surface of the bi-convex MLA, one can define Dp as ng \u00d7 rp/(ng - 1) so that the plano-convex microlens produce telecentric micro-image at its planar back plane. Thus ffib and hence d and Dp define rp as well. On the other hand, DG defines the MLA clear aperture diameter which in turn defines the sky sampling size (via plate scale). We provide mathematical prescriptions of all these dependencies in the following section 3 and more details about their derivation can be found in Appendix A."

            "text": "Other microlens relay options include transfer of the image with a pupil onto the fiber entrance aperture. These so-called pupil-transfer systems have the advantage of requiring only one MLA. In the simplest case using a single plano-convex MLA can be bonded directly to the fiber to minimize reflection losses. Unfortunately, the pupil image onto the fiber is not telecentric, leading to potentially significant gFRD. Because the fibers azimuthally scramble the input signal, the non-telecentric feed cannot be corrected at the fiber output. It is straightforward to correct for this by replacing the plano-convex MLA with something similar to the biconvex MLA seen in Figure 2. Consequently pupil-transfer systems will have similar, but simpler descriptions and constraints compared to the image-relay microlens systems. For this reason we break out the constraints from both the bi-convex and plano-convex elements."

            "text": "While the re-imaging MLA system does not require additional air-glass surfaces to create a telecentric design, it does place constraints on the lenslet design as we will see below. Further, as noted above a telecentric pupil-imaging MLA system does require the addition of two airglass surfaces. Broadly, then it is worth considering whether imposing telecentric designs are\nworth the cost in either design constraints or reflection losses. It is easiest to understand this in the context of the pupil-imaging MLA system as follows.\nAs a general, qualitative statement for the telecentric pupil-imaging MLA case, given modern multi-layer anti-reflection coatings with broad-band performance achievable at 0.5-1% reflection loss per air-glass surface over more than an octave in wavelength, the bar is not set very high to gain by adding a two air-glass surfaces to eliminate gFRD.\nEquation 3 of [34] can be used to compute the throughput loss due to gFRD. The fraction of the light lost is given byL \u223c (0.4/B)(\u03b4/u) where u is the angle of the marginal ray with respect to the apex of the telecentric beam, \u03b4 is the angle of the marginal ray in the non-telecentric beam with respect to the apex of the telecentric beam at the field edge, and B is the fractional area of the telescope primary mirror unobscured by the secondary mirror. The angles in a PC MLA pupil-imaging system are illustrated in Figure 3. As two representative extrema, B has a value of about 0.95 for the Gemini 8m telescope [35] and a value of about 0.7 for the Sloan 2.5m telescope [36].\nFigure 3 shows that gFRD already leads to 10-30% throughput loss for ftel = 10 (depending on fiber injection speed and telescope central obstruction), and this increases rapidly for faster telescopes. For any plausible telescope f-ratio, uncorrected gFRD losses never fall below 1%. This makes it clear that the telecentric design is preferable in all relevant cases for pupilimaging. For reference the GMOS IFU on Gemini [37] has a PC MLA lenslet system fed at f/50 and injecting light into the fibers at f/4. This system should have\u223c5% thoughtput loss due to gFRD."

Based on discussion with, e.g. A\u00b5S1, we specify these fabrication-based limits for these parameters:\n1. Maximum manufacturing limitation on the thickness (Db or Dp) of a microlens of 10 mm and a minimum of 0.3/0.6 mm for PC and BC MLA respectively.\n2. Fabrication limitation on the minimum radius of curvature of a microlens (rb or rp) of 0.02 mm.\nThe specific values for these parameters depend on the fiber input f-ratio ffib and microimage diameter dm as well as ftel. We also bound ffib and dm in our analysis, as follows, leaving ftel unbounded. We constrain dm by the range of off-the-shelf multi-mode fiber size, with 50 \u00b5m as the smallest, and 600 \u00b5m as the largest that has seen practical use [38].\nThe range of ffib depends on the range of acceptable f-ratios for the spectrograph input (the collimator). Traditional spectrograph designs have preferred slow collimators to increase spectral resolution by decreasing the angular size of the slit while keeping the overall beam size as small as possible. Slower input beams offer the added opportunity of demagnification via fast camera optics to optimize matching to detector focal-planes. However, with fiber coupling, FRD requires collimator speeds of f/5 to prevent significant loss of etendue, as seen in successful fiber-fed spectrograph designs (Hectoechelle[39]; GIRAFF[40]; upgraded WIYN Bench[41]; SDSS/BOSS[42]). Indeed, in more recent designs (e.g., DESI-f/3.7[5], M2FSf/3.4[43], WEAVE-f/3.1[44], MEGARA-f/3[11], PFS-f/2.8[3], DOTIFS-f/4.5[45]), collimators are substantially faster to further minimize FRD. Spectrograph collimators are able to accept f/2.5 with standard off the shelf optics while custom modification may able to grasp faster beams[46] approaching the fiber numerical aperture (typically f/2.2 for standard, hightransmission broad-bandpass step-index fiber). We take 2.5 < ffib < 5 to be a reasonable range for this parameterin order to keep FRD-induced entropy increase minimal to modest (see Figure 1) in standard step-index fiber optics with numerical apertures of 0.22, most commonly used in astronomical instrumentation.\nIn summary, then:\n3.

            "text": "The dominant on-axis aberrations in the micro-lens optical system are due to sphericity and diffraction. Minimizing these as well as higher-order off-axis aberrations is desirable to maximize the encircled energy injected into a finite fiber core. While our analytical model can deal with geometric aberrations (such as SA), the effort to minimize these depends on whether they dominate. First we show that diffraction, even for micro-lens systems, remains a minimal effect, which allows us to focus on the impact of minimizing SA on the lenslet design. These calculations are done at an effective wavelength of 800 nm which is the logarithmic mid-point for good fiber transmission (400-1600nm), and the worse-case limit for diffraction in visiblewavelength systems.\nTo compare diffraction to SA we compare the impact on the radius enclosing 90% of the encircled energy (EE90). In case of SA, the effect can be estimated by the transverse component i.e. the radius of circle of least confusion (CoC) which can be roughly estimated (in radians) as d3/(16r3), where d is the diameter of the entry aperture and r is the radius of curvature. Using equations 3 and 7 for d and rp from Appendix A, we can express this as 1/(16ffib(ng\u22121))3. The increase in edge field EE90 due to diffraction is simply the first minimum of the airy disk which is measured as 1.22\u03bb/d radians. For a system which converts an f/11 telescope beam into an f/3 fiber input within a microimage diameter of 100\u00b5m, the values of rp and d are 0.365 mm and 0.267 mm respectively. At 800 nm, the EE90 due to SA is more than 6 times greater than the same for diffraction. Figure 4 shows the range of ffib and dm (note again: we are assuming dm is the same as the fiber core diameter) where diffraction or SA dominates for different telescope beam speed. It is interesting to note that the system tend to be more diffraction limited with slower ffib for a given dm and ftel. Slower ffib would also (1) introduce additional FRD; (2) reduce the grasp of the system, (3) reduce the radius of curvature of the optical elements; and hence are not advisable to use. Thus for practical purpose we would concentrate on the range of ffib, dm and ftel where SA dominates. Our f-ratio selection range also shows that beyond ftel/7, most of our optimization space comes under systems that are mostly SA dominated."

We then check if this analytic model is accurate when considering higher-order aberrations, and conclude on the limits our calculations place on the telescope focal-ratio.\nTo minimize the effects of light-loss from SA, we assume the thickness of microlens positions the CoC on the exit surface of the PC microlens (the fiber input core location). We can estimate this PC thickness as the distance from the entry into MLA to the point of crossing the optical axis by a marginal ray given the separation between the chief and the marginal ray and lenslet radius of curvature is known. This is an analytical description of the longitudinal SA. We have used this description to derive the relative constraint between PC MLA thickness and radius of curvature for a given da and dm (hence \u03b7). Likewise for a given radius of CoC (depending on how fast is the PC MLA) we can work out the losses for a fiber with a diameter of dm. If the prescription on the PC MLA thickness and radius become too severe we can define\nfor which diffraction or spherical aberration dominates for different telescope beam speeds.

We found that analytical solutions to be cumbersome to define the location and radius of CoC and hence we used the numerical approach. It may be noted that the result of the analytical model is still important as an initial condition for performing optical simulation to predict precise SA losses in specific IFU design studies.\nWe used d/2 as the marginal ray height and normalized with rp. Their ratio only depends on ffib and ng. On the other hand, the normalized paraxial focus location is ng/(ng \u2212 1) as described in Appendix B. Given this, we compute the radius and location of CoC and marginal focus for a grid of r2/rp (refer to Figure 13 in Appendix C) from 0 to 0.15 with 101 samples while the position along the optical axis had 51 samples between 3 and 3.3 mm. The result is tabulated in Table 1 which establishes the well known facts (47): (a) the radius of the circle of least confusion, rcoc, is \u223c 0.25 times the beam radius at marginal ray height; (b) the distance of CoC from paraxial focus is \u223c 0.75 times the distance of marginal focus from the paraxial focus.

            "text": "Aberrations are not the only component that set a bound on the usable telescope focal ratio, ftel. Several optical parameters, such as the radius of curvature and thickness of PC and BC microlenses also pose constraints. In this section we describe the limiting conditions originating from such manufacturing limitations for various micro-image diameters, dm, and fiber injection speeds, ffib. These limits are computed using our analytical model in Section 3. We use openly available information provided by A\u00b5S as a benchmark for fabrication.\n6.1 Limits on ftel from lenslet radii of curvature\nFigures 6 and 7 show the effect of ffib, and dm and ftel on the required radii of curvature (RoC) for bi-convex (rb) and plano-convex (rp) MLAs, respectively. Clearly the fabrication limit on rb does not constrain ftel for any fiber size and injection speed consider. Similarly, for On the other hand, the fabrication limit on rp shows that for 50 \u00b5m fiber it is necessary for ftel \u2265 6 for ffib = 5, but it does not provide any restriction for faster fiber injection speeds ffib < 4. For larger fibers (\u2265 100\u00b5m) we can conclude broadly that there is no limiting ftel originating from fabrication constraints on the MLA RoC.\n6.2 Limits on ftel from MLA thickness\nApart from the microlens radius of curvature, the microlens thicknesses (dp and db) also constrain the telescope f-ratio range. Equations 5 and 10 in Appendix A show both dp and db increase linearly with dm and hence the manufacturable thickness could pose constraints on\nftel. We have computed the dependence of ftel on MLA thickness for different fiber injection speeds and micro-image diameters in Figures 8 and 9.\nFor fabrication thickness upper limits, a PC MLA can have arbitrarily large thickness by bonding it to a flat substrate. However, for the BC MLA, the registration error between curved faces increases with thickness and hence a manufacturing limit of 10 mm is used by the vendors. It should be noted that with additional effort of alignment and bonding, two PC MLAs and arbitrarily thick glass plate can be used to eliminate the thickness upper limit. Consequently the BC MLA thickness upper limit is taken to be a soft limit. In general MLA thickness upper limits tend to drive the telescope speed to be faster. As can be seen in Figures 8 and 9, a 10 mm thickness upper limit, the bi-convex MLA sets ftel \u2264 7(11) for ffib = 2.5(5), respectively, for 600 \u00b5m fibers. For smaller fibers with diameter \u2264 100 \u00b5m the thickness does not limit the ftel within the range of telescope focal ratios that is being considered. The PC MLA thickness imposes no limits on ftel as it can be increased arbitrarily.\nFor fabrication thickness lower limits, the manufacturer has to ensure that the array is flat and thus it is difficult to reduce lenslet thickness below 0.3 and 0.6 mm for PC and BC MLA respectively. In general MLA thickness lower limits tend to drive the telescope speed to be slower. As can be seen in Figures 8 and 9, the minimum thickness forces ftel \u2265 9(11) for 50 \u00b5m fiber for ffib = 2.5(5) but does not limit fibers with \u2265 400\u00b5m cores.\n6.3 Summary of limitations on ftel\nTable 3 compiles all the limitations on ftel from different criteria presented in this and the previous section (4). In the final columns we take the most conservative option as our final limit. In most cases the lower limit is set by \u2018SA,\u2019 which includes the impact of all aberrations on EE98. This means that this limit is unaffected by any potential future improvements in fabrication limits for spherical lenslet figures. Aspherics may alter this picture, and are worthy\nof future consideration. In constrast, the upper limit on ftel is constrained solely by the BC MLA thickness upper limit. As described above, this upper limit may be surmountable and as such there is no hard upper limit on the telescope beam speed.\nIt is evident and intuitive that faster telescope beams require the optical dimensions of the microlens arrays to be smaller and hence lossier for fiber-coupling due to increased aberrations. Less intuitive is the fact that for larger fiber core diameter, the limiting telescope f-ratio gets faster. The effect is most pronounced going from the diffraction-limited to SA dominated regimes (in the range 50 \u00b5m < dm < 100 \u00b5m). Indeed, in the SA dominated regime the limiting telescope f-ratio is constant for a given fiber input beam speed, and only changes by 33% for a factor of two change in fiber injection speed.\nWe provide a visual summary of the Table 3 in Figure 10 where the final range of acceptable telescope focal ratios are plotted against fiber diameter for three fiber input beam speeds. In terms of conserving grasp, it is important to note that due to FRD it is preferable to use fiber injection speeds closer to ffib = 3 than ffib = 5. Overall, however, it is important to keep in mind that the grasp (A \u2126) does not depend on the telescope focal-ratio but rather only on the square of the telescope diameter Dtel (collecting area, A), and the product of dm/(Dtel \u00d7 ffib) (solid angle, \u2126). While the solid angle can be re-written as da/(Dtel \u00d7 ftel), fundamentally the grasp is driven by the telescope size and the considerations of the spectrograph injection speed and aperture, hence the fiber size dm and the fiber injection speed.\nAs a common practice in slit spectroscopy, astronomers often need to modulate the slit width at fixed focal ratio to optimize the resolution-throughput product of their observations given the requirements of the scientific program, the observing conditions, and the angular scale of their sources. For fiber spectroscopy, including lenslet-coupled IFUs, this is equivalent to changing the fiber core diameter at fixed focal ratio. In this context Figure 10 shows that for fiber sizes smaller than 100 \u00b5m there is a limited range in fiber size that can be accommodated\nat fixed telescope and fiber injection speeds. Conversely, for fiber core diameters of 100 \u00b5m and larger lenslet coupling can be achieved with a fixed telescope focal ratio of f/8 for fiber injection at f/3 (or f/9 to f/10 for fiber injection at f/4, etc.). Similarly, for fiber cores > 100 \u00b5m, there is a broader range of fiber injection speeds at a fixed telescope focal ratio in the range of 8 to 10, with f/8 providing the largest range of fiber injection speeds. On this basis we suggest f/8 as the optimum telescope f-ratio in terms lenslet-fiber coupling flexibility for fibers with core sizes\u2265 100 \u00b5m. The use of smaller fibers may apply to small telescopes (below 4m) where the science requires matching of the fiber core to the seeing disk. While Figure 10 indicates that telescope focal ratios faster than f/8 would allow for faster injection speeds for larger fibers, the faster telescope focal ratios will limit the dynamic range in fiber core size over which this is possible."

            "text": "In this paper we presented the trade-offs in optical design of micro-lens reimaging systems constrained to link telescope focal planes to fiber optics. Specifically, we have examined the constraints on telescope focal ratio for a realistic range of fiber core diameters and fiber injection speeds given (i) manufacturing limitations on micro-lens arrays and (ii) the need to have high-efficiency coupling. For this trade study we have developed an analytical model from first principals and two basic conditions: (a) the BC MLA should produce the pupil at its exit surface; (b) the image produced by the PC MLA must be telecentric to eliminate geometric FRD. We evaluate the efficacy of the model by considering the salient performance parameter of fibers acting as photon buckets: the percentage of energy enclosed with the fiber core by the compound lenslet system. We adopt this metric rather than RMS spot radius since fibers scramble the spatial information. In this regard the performance of the model-predicted optical design matches within 4% of optimized models using ray-trace software. We have also characterized in detail the different regimes in which these MLA systems are dominated (on axis) by diffraction versus SA. While the detailed micro-lens parameters (thickness, spacing, radius of curvature) are more accurately prescribed by our analytic model in the SA limited regime, in all cases, the model designs provide better than 98% throughput apart from Fresnel losses at the glass-air boundaries in all regimes.\nWe computed the overall upper and lower limits on telescope focal ratio set by the fabrication limit of BC and PC MLA as well as light-losses from SA and off-axis aberrations. Lower limits on ftel are set by considering light-losses into the fiber, while upper limits are set by the BC MLA thickness. This upper limit of ftel may be relaxed via additional effort in replacing a monolithic BC MLA with two back-facing PC MLAs, possibly separated by a flat glass plate.\nWe find the telescope focal ratio lower-limit falls precipitously from the smallest fibers considered (50 \u00b5m) to 100 \u00b5m, which corresponds to the transition between diffraction to SA dominated regimes. For fibers larger than 100 \u00b5m the limiting telescope focal-ratio is given roughly by ftel,lower = 0.8ffib + 4 and ftel,upper = 2ffib + 3. For the smallest 50 \u00b5m fibers ftel,lower = 1.5ffib + 4, with no upper limit. The case for the 100 \u00b5m fiber core is intermediate to these two limiting cases.\nFor a spectrograph fed directly by fibers injected with 3 < ffib < 5, we find that an f/8 telescope would support fiber diameters from 100 to 500 \u00b5m within the optimized range. This enables a wide range of spatial and spectral resolution for survey optimization with the same telescope and spectrograph hardware. Finally we comment that while it is always preferable to reduce the number of optical elements when possible, the native telescope focal ratio can often be reimaged by a suitable focal reducer or expander. On the basis of our analysis we suggest such additional optics should be designed, for most applications, to deliver a focal surface feeding micro-lens arrays at f/8. MLA designs with additional, or aspheric surfaces may alter these conclusions, but such augmentation incurs additional cost and complexity in design, fabrication and assembly."

The fiber input f-ratio ffib is defined in the air while Dp and d defines the f-ratio in glass. Hence ffib is usually multiplied with refractive index of glass (ng) at the system wavelength.\nA.1 Optical diameters\nRelevant diameters can be computed by using the conservation of entropy (grasp) to relate the bi-convex MLA clear aperture da then can be formulated as a function of micro-image diameter dm:\nda = ftel\n( ffib dm\n) = dm \u03b7. (2)\nFrom this, the beam diameter for a single field point at the input of the Plano-convex MLA (PC) is d \u2264 da\u2212dm. This follows by construction in Figure 2 due to the constraints that (i) the PC MLA diameter cannot not exceed that of the BC MLA diameter, and (ii) the telecentricity requirement stipulates the principle ray for the edge field-point must fall at a height of dm/2 from the optical axis while the distance between the marginal and principle ray is d/2. Hence d/2 + dm/2 has to be equal to da/2, namely the clear aperture diameter of the PC and BC lenslets. Although d can be less than da\u2212dm, this reduces rp. Hence maximizing d helps minimize SA, so we take d = da \u2212 dm. This condition for d can be rewritten with equation 2 as\nd = dm (\u03b7\u2212 1). (3)\nA.2 PC MLA thickness and radius of curvature\nFrom fiber input focal ratio, one can deduce that the plano-convex lens thickness is simply:\nffib ng = Dp d . (4)\nNote that since f-ratio is determined in air, refractive index has to be multiplied to get the f-ratio in the glass. This can be rewritten using equation 3 as:\nDp = dmngffib (\u03b7\u2212 1). (5)\nUsing the lens makers equation for plano convex lens with rp is the radius curvature of the curved surface and the other side is flat, we can state that,\n1\nDp/ng = (ng \u2212 1)(\n1 rp \u2212 1 \u221e ). (6)\nAgain note the use of ng as a dividing factor as the focal length is usually defined in air but in our case the focus is the flat back plane of the MLA. Hence the thickness of PC lenslets should in air focal length multiplied by the refractive index of the glass. Hence, the plano-convex MLA (PC) radius of curvature can then be written as:\nrp = Dp(ng \u2212 1)/ng = dmffib(ng \u2212 1)(\u03b7\u2212 1). (7)\nA.3 MLA spacing\nAgain, using the lens makers equation for plano convex lens we can find that,\n1\nDG = (ng \u2212 1)(\n1 rp \u2212 1 \u221e ). (8)\nSince DG is defined in air we don\u2019t need to include ng. Hence the gap between the bi-convex and plano-convex MLA can be derived as\nDG = rp/(ng \u2212 1) = dmffib (\u03b7\u2212 1). (9)\nA.4 BC MLA thickness and radius of curvature\nSimilar to plano-convex MLA, the bi-convex MLA (BC) thickness can be derived as:\nDb = ngdftel = dmngftel (\u03b7\u2212 1). (10)\nThe bi-convex MLA (BC) radius of curvature can be derived from the path of chief ray of the edge field inside the BC MLA as shown in Figure 11, as follows. From Snell\u2019s law, sin \u03b8 = ng sin\u03b2, and from Figure 11 we have \u03b8 = \u03b1 + \u03b2.\nFrom this, we can easily derive\ntan\u03b2 = sin\u03b1\nng \u2212 cos\u03b1 , (11)\nwhile from the right angle triangle we can define sin\u03b1 as\nsin\u03b1 \u2248 da/2\u221a (da/2)2 + D2b , (12)\nand similarly,\nsin(\u03b1 + \u03b2) = da/2\nrb , (13)\nwhich we can combine to write:\ntan\u03b2 = da/2\u221a\n(ngrb)2 \u2212 (da/2)2 . (14)\nFrom equations 14 and 11 we can easily define the radius of the BC MLA as,\nrb = 1\nng\n[( ng \u221a (da/2)2 + Db 2 \u2212Db )2 + (da/2) 2 ]1/2 (15)\nfor which equations 2 and 10 can be used to express rb in terms of ftel, ffib (or ftel and \u03b7), and dm:\nrb = dm \u03b7 [(\u221a 1/4 + (ng ffib (\u03b7\u2212 1))2 \u2212 ffib (\u03b7\u2212 1) )2 + 1/(4n2g) ]1/2 .

The location would directly define the thickness of the PC lenslet while the CoC radius would impose condition on the lenslet properties in order to restrict the micro-image to form within the fiber core to reduce photon loss at the MLA-fiber junction. Increasing the fiber core diameter arbitrarily to engulf entire micro-image would lead to increase in optical entropy which can be equated to loss of observation time.\nNow having the analytical description of thickness of PC lenslet in our arsenal, we will describe the radius and position of circle of least confusion and what should be the strategy for minimizing the radius. In figure 13 we define a plano-convex microlens of radius of curvature R fed with a collimated beam. The height of the ray from the optical axis is r; \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the angles of incidence and refraction at the input surface, respectively; q and \u03b4 are the distances of the crossing of optical axis inside the microlens and chief ray entry point to the arbitrary ray entry point respectively.
