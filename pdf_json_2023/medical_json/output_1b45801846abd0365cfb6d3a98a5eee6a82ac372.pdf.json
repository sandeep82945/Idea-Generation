Anoikis is a special programmed cell death mode induced by the adhesion disorder between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) or adjacent cells facilitating cancer metastasis. However, few studies have focused on the role of anoikis in PV, especially on the development of PV.\nMethods: The microarray and RNA-seq results were screened from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the anoikis-related genes (ARGs) were downloaded from Genecards. The functional enrichment analysis of intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed to discover hub genes. The hub genes expression was tested in the training (GSE136335) and validation cohort (GSE145802), and RT-qPCR was performed to verify the gene expression in PV mice.\nResults: In the training GSE136335, a total of 1,195 DEGs was obtained from Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) patients compared with controls, among which 58 were anoikis-related DEGs. The significant enrichment of the apoptosis and cell adhesion pathways (i.e., cadherin binding) were shown in functional enrichment analysis. The PPI network was conducted to identify top five hub genes (CASP3, CYCS, HIF1A, IL1B, MCL1). The expression of CASP3 and IL1B were significantly upregulated both in validation cohort and PV mice and downregulated after treatment, suggesting that CASP3 and IL1B could be important indicators for disease surveillance.\nConclusion: Our research revealed a relationship between anoikis and PV for the first time by combined analysis of gene level, protein interaction and functional enrichment, allowing novel insights into mechanisms of PV. Moreover, CASP3 and IL1B may become promising indicators of PV development and treatment.\nKEYWORDS\nmyeloproliferative neoplasms, anoikis-related genes, differentially expressed genes, protein-protein interaction, hub genes"

            "text": "Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) are the abnormal clonal myeloproliferation arising from the hematopoietic stem cells with acquired somatic mutation, and constitutional systematic phenotypes (Cervantes et al., 2008; Mead and Mullally, 2017). The latest World Health Organization (WHO) classified MPNs into chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) BCR::ABL1+, polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (Arber et al., 2016). The latter three are generally called BCR::ABL1- MPNs (hereinafter referred to as MPNs).\nPV, the commonest MPN, is characterized with erythrocytosis in consequence of JAK2 exon 14 or 12 somatic mutations (Baxter et al., 2005; James et al., 2005; Kralovics et al., 2005; Levine et al., 2005; Scott et al., 2007). Unlike ET or PMF, PV is characterized by progressive increase in erythropoiesis, splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and arterial and venous thrombosis (Spivak, 2017). In addition, some patients with PV are at risk of transformation to bone marrow failure, myelofibrosis, and acute leukemia (Spivak, 2017). Ruxolitinib, a typical JAK1/2 inhibitor, was used to provide systemic symptom relief in post-PV myelofibrosis (PPMF) (Verstovsek et al., 2012) and chronic-phase PV (Vannucchi et al., 2015; Passamonti et al., 2017), while did not promote apoptosis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and failed to achieve molecular remissions (Wang et al., 2014).\nAnoikis, a type of programmed apoptosis, is induced by incorrect attachment between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) or adjacent cells, playing important role in eradicating misplaced or dislodged cells to maintain tissue homeostasis (Han et al., 2021). Some studies suggested anoikis occurred through intrinsic/extrinsic pathways and could be triggered by several intracellular signals such as DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Li et al., 2019; Zhi et al., 2022). Anoikis is essential for cancer cell survival through the detachment from ECM, and anoikis resistance is a key factor in cancer invasion and metastasis (Berezovskaya et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2012; Kakavandi et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022).\nClonal cell proliferation leads to increased risk of thrombosis and threatens the life of PV and ET patients (Barbui et al., 2013). Whereas, complications of thrombosis in myelofibrosis (MF) are as frequent as in ET but less than in PV (Kc et al., 2017). Recently, the abnormal expression of adhesion molecules like Lu/BCAM and CD147 was reported in PV patients, which was reduced under interferon-\u03b1 treatment but enhanced by hydroxyurea (Brusson et al., 2018). These results indicated the important role of cell adhesion in PV and PV treatment. However, few studies had systematically evaluated the effect of anoikis in hematological cancers especially MPNs.\nTherefore, in this study, we focused on exploring the expression levels of anoikis-related genes in the occurrence, progression and treatment of MPNs, as well as exploring the key anoikis-related genes by means of bioinformatics analysis."

Firstly, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened inMPNs andMPN sub types including PV, ET, PMF and post-PV myelofibrosis (pPVMF), as well as the intersection of the DEGs and ARGs was analyzed. And then functional enrichment GO and KEGG analyses were performed. Lastly, PPI network analysis was conducted and the top 5 hub genes were found in the network. In addition, the corresponding hub genes in different validation cohorts were validated and the hub genes of PV in our mice model were detected.\nData processing and screening of anoikisrelated DEGs\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with MPNs and healthy controls were identified in GSE136335 dataset via the \u201climma\u201d R package (Gentleman, 2005), the cutoff for adjustment: p-value <0.05 and FC (fold change) > 1.5. The \u201cggplot2\u201d R package (Ito and Murphy, 2013) was used to visualize the DEGs into a volcano map, while the \u201cpheatmap\u201d R package (Szekely and Rizzo, 2005) was used to cluster the anoikisrelated DEGs. The intersection between DEGs and ARGs was visualized by the Veen plot.\nFunctional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis of anoikis-related DEGs.\nGene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of anoikis-related DEGs were performed by using \u201cclusterProfiler\u201d R package (Wu et al., 2021). GO analysis is important to explore the biological functions, consisting of three subtypes, including biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) (Ashburner et al., 2000). KEGG analysis is used to explore potential pathways (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) The STRING online website (https://string-db.org/) was to conduct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of anoikisrelated DEGs. The results of STRING were imported into Cytoscape (version 3.7.2), and the hub genes was extracted by using the cytoHubba plugin. Finally, top five genes were selected with the highest scores (Degree algorithm) in the network as hub genes."

For analyses in the Jak2V617F bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model, experiments were performed in strict adherence to China laws for animal welfare. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (20220247).\nFor gene expression analysis in the conditional Jak2V617F knock-in model of PV, bone marrow (BM) from primary Vavcre Jak2V617F (Vavcre+ Jak2VF/+) mice (Tiedt et al., 2008; Mullally et al., 2010) (Jackson Lab (United States) was transplanted into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice (Slac Laboratory Animal Inc. Shanghai, China) (PV group), and the recipients progressed to PV before being used in the MEPs (megakaryocyte and erythroid progenitors) flow sorting experiment. As competitor transplantation, bone marrow from C57BL/6 recipient mice was transplanted into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipients (WT group).\n6\u20138 weeks after BMT, BM cells of PV and WT recipients were harvested from bilateral femurs and tibias by crushing bones with mortar and pestle using PBS (Servicebio). Cells were filtered through 70 \u03bcm nylon mesh to obtain a single-cell suspension. Red blood cells were depleted by using erythrocyte lysis buffer (ACK buffer, Invitrogen).\nFor FACS analysis and cell sorting: EasySep\u2122 Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Isolation Kit (Catalog #19856, STEMCELL) was used to enrich the Lin\u2212 cells with biotinylated antibodies recognizing specific cell surface markers.

Information and characteristics of the three datasets were summarized in Table1. The GSE136335 was confirmed as a discovery cohort with GSE145802 paired as a validated cohort.\nIdentification of anoikis-related DEGs between MPNs and controls\n1195 DEGs were identified by screening GSE136335, with 557 downregulated genes (Figure 2A, blue dot) and 638 upregulated genes (Figure 2A, red dot). 795 anoikis-related genes were downloaded from the \u201cGeneCard\u201d database (Supplementary Table S1).

The heat map in Figure 2C showed the standardized expression of\nanoikis-related DEGs (36 upregulated and 22 downregulated). The PPI network (Figure 2D) containing 54 nodes and 144 edges was obtained. Figure 3 showed the relative expression profiles of 58 anoikis-related DEGs in the MPNs (Figure 3A) and MPNsubtypes (Figure 3B).\nIn GO-BP analysis (Figure 4A), the major pathways were also apoptosis or oxidative stress pathways. In GO-CC analysis (Figure 4B), collagen-containing extracellular matrix was significantly enriched. The results of enrichment analysis in GOMF (Figure 4C) were mainly the activation of cell adhesion-related pathway like cadherin binding. In the KEGG analysis (Figure 4D), the top 10 enriched pathways were mainly apoptosis, FoxO signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, etc.\nIdentification of anoikis-related DEGs between PV and controls\n925 DEGs were identified in PV patients compared with controls, with 513 downregulated genes and 412 upregulated genes (Figure 5A). Intersection analysis showed 36 anoikisrelated DEGs (Figure 5B). The standardized expression of anoikis-related DEGs (17 upregulated and 19 downregulated) was shown in the heat map (Figure 5C). The results of enrichment analysis in GO and KEGG (Figure 5D; Supplementary Figure S1A) were also mainly focused on the apoptosis and activation of cell adhesion-related pathway like integrin binding. PPI network (Figure 6A) was constructed to select top 5 hub genes (CASP3, IL1B, HIF1A, CYCS, MCL1) (Figure 6B) according to the Degree algorithm. The expression levels of hub genes in training set were shown (Figure 6C).\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org05\nValidation analysis was conducted by using another dataset GSE145802. The expression levels of anoikis related DEGs in PV, CASP3, IL1B, HIF1A were significantly upregulated and CYCS was obviously downregulated, while the expression of MCL1 was downward trend in PV patients compared with normal controls (Figure 7A). However, the expression levels of anoikis related DEGs in PV-treated, only HIF1A was upregulate (Figure 7B).\nExpression difference of hub genes in PV mice model\nThe expression of five PV hub genes was verified with our experimental data. PV mice model with Jak2V617F mutation (PV) and the corresponding WT mice (WT) were constructed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assay (Figure 8A). The spleen weight (Figure 8B) and hematocrit (HCT) (Figure 8C) of the recipient mice were measured 6\u20138 weeks after BMT, and the results indicated PV models successfully were constructed. PV\nand WT MEP cells were obtained by Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Isolation Kit combined with FACS sorting (List of flow cytometry antibodies can be found in Supplementary Table S2) following the strict experimental procedures (Figure 8D). The relative mRNA expression (The sequences of the primers are listed in Supplementary Table S3) of Casp3 and Il1b were upregulated in MEPs of PV mice compared with WT mice (Figure 8E). However, other hub genes had no difference between these two group mice."

            "text": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are myeloid malignancies characterized by clonal expansion of one or more differentiated myeloid lineages (Dameshek, 1951). Anoikis, a particular form of programmed cell death, was reported to perform important biological function in preventing attachment\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org06\nor grow of dysplastic cell for tissue homeostasis and development (Bakir et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). Anoikis plays a crucial role in tumor invasion, migration, distant metastasis and drug resistance (Jin et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021).\nIn our study, a new view of differential expression anoikisrelated gene sets in MPN patients and controls was provided. MPNs are the malignancies caused by dysfunctional HSC, thus CD34+ PB/BM MNCs was chosen for bioinformatics analysis. The intersection of MPN-DEGs and ARGs revealed 58 anoikisrelated genes were specifically associated with MPNs. Gene set enrichment analysis showed cell adhesion and apoptosis-related pathways were fully enriched to activate the anoikis pathway. However, in MPNs, circulating cells with disease driver\nmutations (such as JAK2V617F), including red cells, leukocytes, platelets, as well as some vascular endothelial cells, were abnormal (Hasselbalch et al., 2021). When activated in MPNs, these abnormal cells interacted with each other and created proadhesive and prothrombotic environment in the circulation to predispose patients to thrombosis and occlusive complications (Hasselbalch et al., 2021).\nPV is characterized by mutations in JAK2 exon 14 or 12 in hematopoietic stem cells, leading to erythrocytosis and systematic symptoms (Greenfield et al., 2021). PV mainly reduces the quality of life and shortens the life span of patients due to the risk of vascular events and transformation to myelofibrosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia (Tefferi et al., 2013;\nFIGURE 5 Landscape of Anoikis-related Genes in Polycythemia Vera.

Node color reflects the degree of connectivity (red color represents a higher degree, and yellow color represents a lower degree). (C) The expression difference of five hub genes in the training set (GSE136335).\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org08\nTiribelli et al., 2015; Frederiksen et al., 2019). Our results found that 36 DEGs in PV were associated with anoikis. Combined with the results of gene expression and gene enrichment, CD34+ mononuclear cells in PV deflected stronger adhesion effect than apoptosis, in accordance with the characteristics of PV prone to thromboembolism. Five hub genes (CASP3, IL1B, HIF1A, CYCS, MCL1) was selected with highest score through PPI network combined further analysis. The pro-apoptotic gene CASP3 was expressed higher in PV-CD34+ cells in the training and validation cohorts and in MEP cells in our PV mouse model, contrary to previous report (Steidl et al., 2005). The large variation may root in PV patients of different sources. The level of proinflammatory factor IL1B was upregulated in PV-CD34+ cells in training and validation cohorts and in MEP cells in our PVmouse model, consistent with previous report (Vaidya et al., 2012). Baumeister, Julian et al. reported higher protein level of HIF1\u03b1 in 32D Jak2V617F-expressing cells than Jak2WT, and identified HIF-1 target genes involved in the Warburg effect as a possible underlying mechanism in JAK2V617F-positive MPN (Baumeister et al., 2020). The mRNA level of HIF1A was higher in PV-CD34+ cells in validation cohort. MCL1, a typical anti-apoptotic gene, plays a crucial role in the survival of HSCs and early progenitors (Opferman et al., 2005). Importantly, depletion of Mcl-1 was able to disrupt the viability of JAK2V617F mutant cells and sensitized mutant cells to JAK2 inhibitor therapy (Rubert et al., 2011). CYCS, as an apoptotic protein, is located between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Ow et al., 2008; Shakeri et al., 2017) and is released into the cytoplasm in response to cell death signals and activated by pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins (Wolter et al., 1997; Kennedy et al., 1999). The expressions of apoptotic-related genes MCL1 and CYCS decreased in the PV-CD34 + cells of the training and verification cohorts, while no difference was found in the PV mice MEP cells. CASP3 and IL1B were significantly increased in PV and decreased after treatment in validation cohort and expected to become indicators in PV development and treatment. The inconformity between our results and previously reported may arise from following aspects: Firstly, the analyzed data was from peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells of MPN patients, excluding erythrocytes and granulocytes. Secondly, some vascular endothelial cells with driver mutations were also excluded. Thirdly, MPN in our study was a group of diseases rather than a single disease, and the degree of cell adhesion and apoptosis varies among subtypes. Finally, our results suggested that CD34+mononuclear cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood contributed significantly less to thromboembolism than other types of cells. AlthoughMPNs are a myeloid proliferative disease, our research firstly revealed the critical role of anoikis-related genes in MPNs. CASP3,CYCS,HIF1A, IL1B,MCL1 are the anoikis-related hub genes in PV and CASP3 and IL1Bmay become important indicators of PV development and treatment. And our research may provide new insight into mechanisms of PV."
