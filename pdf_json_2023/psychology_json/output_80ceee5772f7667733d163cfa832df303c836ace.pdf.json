    "abstractText": "Mangosteen peel, a waste produced during mangosteen processing, has been reported to be rich in xanthone and anthocyanin, both of which possess vital biological activities such as anti-cancer properties. The objectives of this study were to analyze various xanthones and anthocyanins in mangosteen peel by UPLC-MS/MS for the subsequent preparation of both xanthone and anthocyanin nanoemulsions to study their inhibition effects on liver cancer cells HepG2. Results showed that methanol was the optimal solvent for the extraction of xanthones and anthocyanins, with a total amount of 68,543.39 and 2909.57 \u03bcg/g, respectively. A total of seven xanthones, including garcinone C (513.06 \u03bcg/g), garcinone D (469.82 \u03bcg/g), \u03b3-mangostin (11,100.72 \u03bcg/g), 8-desoxygartanin (1490.61 \u03bcg/g), gartanin (2398.96 \u03bcg/g), \u03b1-mangostin (51,062.21 \u03bcg/g) and \u03b2-mangostin (1508.01 \u03bcg/g), as well as two anthocyanins including cyanidin-3-sophoroside (2889.95 \u03bcg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (19.72 \u03bcg/g), were present in mangosteen peel. The xanthone nanoemulsion was prepared by mixing an appropriate portion of soybean oil, CITREM, Tween 80 and deionized water, while the anthocyanin nanoemulsion composed of soybean oil, ethanol, PEG400, lecithin, Tween 80, glycerol and deionized water was prepared as well. The mean particle size of the xanthone extract and nanoemulsion were, respectively, 22.1 and 14.0 nm as determined by DLS, while the zeta potential was \u221287.7 and \u221261.5 mV. Comparatively, xanthone nanoemulsion was more effective than xanthone extract in inhibiting the growth of HepG2 cells, with the IC50 being 5.78 \u03bcg/mL for the former and 6.23 \u03bcg/mL for the latter. However, the anthocyanin nanoemulsion failed to inhibit growth of HepG2 cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the proportion of the sub-G1 phase followed a dose-dependent increase, while that of the G0/G1 phase showed a dose-dependent decline for both xanthone extracts and nanoemulsions, with the cell cycle being possibly arrested at the S phase. The proportion of late apoptosis cells also followed a dose-dependent rise for both xanthone extracts and nanoemulsions, with the latter resulting in a much higher proportion at the same dose. Similarly, the activities of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 followed a dose-dependent increase for both xanthone extracts and nanoemulsions, with the latter exhibiting a higher activity at the same dose. Collectively, xanthone nanoemulsion was more effective than xanthone extract in inhibiting the growth of HepG2 cells. Further research is needed to study the anti-tumor effect in vivo.",

            "text": "Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.), a popular tropical fruit mainly grown in southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, is rich in nutrients and phytochemicals such as xanthones and anthocyanins [1,2]. However, the edible portion (pulp) only accounts for 31% of the whole mangosteen fruit, with the remaining inedible portion being peel (69%). Nevertheless, compared to the pulp portion, the peel portion was shown to contain a 10-fold higher level of polyphenol compounds such as xanthones,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3934. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24043934 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3934 2 of 29\nanthocyanins and tannins, as well as 20-fold higher antioxidant activity [2]. Thus, it will be a great advantage to the food industry if the polyphenol compounds in mangosteen peel can be isolated and processed into health foods. Malaysia, a major country producing mangosteen, developed mangosteen maturity indices to satisfy needs of different markets for export. For instance, the fruit is suitable for export when the color is red or brownish red and the separation of the rind and pulp is easy, while the fruit is suitable for consumption when the color is red-purple and no gum is present in the rind [3]. Furthermore, Palapol et al. [4] analyzed the anthocyanin content in mangosteen peel during ripening and reported a higher content of anthocyanin in purple-brown peel than in pink peel by 20-fold. Thus, the peel color change of mangosteen should be monitored carefully to obtain the maximum level of polyphenol compounds for subsequent processing. In recent years, the biological activities of mangosteen peel, including anti-oxidation, anti-cancer, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetes and cardiovascular protection, have been well documented [5], which can be attributed to the presence of xanthone and anthocyanin. Xanthone, composed of tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, possesses high stability and is the most abundant bioactive compound in mangosteen peel. More than 60 xanthones have been characterized in mangosteen, and a much higher content of xanthone was shown in the peel than in pulp, with the main xanthones in the former including \u03b1-mangostin, \u03b3mangostin, 8-desoxygartanin, gartanin, garcinone C, garcinone D and \u03b2-mangostin [5,6]. Of the various xanthones in mangosteen peel, \u03b1-mangostin was present in the highest amount and investigated most often for its physiological activities. For instance, \u03b1- mangostin was shown to possess high antioxidant activity through scavenging singlet oxygen, superoxide anions and peroxynitrite anions [7]. Additionally, both \u03b1-mangostin and \u03b3-mangostin were effective in anti-inflammation through a decline of cytokine expressions such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 [8] and anti-diabetes, through the inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase activity [9]. For an anti-cancer study, \u03b1-mangostin was efficient in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and cervical cancer stem cells, with the former through the decreased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, resulting in retarding 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced cancer cell metastasis [10], and the latter through the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 for the elevation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities, leading to cell apoptosis [11]. Like xanthone, anthocyanin also represents a vital biological compound in mangosteen peel, with cyanidin-3-sophoroside and cyanidin-3-glucoside dominating, and the contents were reported to be 3 and 0.1 mg/g, respectively, when the maturation reached the final stage [12]. However, anthocyanins are highly unstable and susceptible to degradation loss and color change under high pH, high temperature and illumination [13]. In a study dealing with the degradation kinetics of anthocyanins from European cranberry bush fruit extracts, Moldovan et al. [14] reported that the lower the pH, the higher the stability of anthocyanin, and the most optimal pH for the storage of cranberry juice should be controlled at pH 1\u20133. Khoo et al. [15] further reported that, compared to heating temperature at 25 \u25e6C, the grape anthocyanin content was reduced by half when heated at 35 \u25e6C, while the blackberry anthocyanin degradation was shown to fit the second-order reaction kinetics, with the half-life being 28.20 h under illumination intensity of 3968.30 lx [16]. Nevertheless, anthocyanins have been reported to exhibit many biological activities. For example, the roselle anthocyanins were shown to possess strong antioxidant activity with the IC50 of inhibiting DPPH and ABTS free radicals being 4.06 and 3.7 mg/mL, respectively [17]. In a later study, Lee et al. [18] reported that cyanidin chloride was effective in inhibiting the growth of colon cancer cells including HCT116, HT29 and SW620 through the retardation of NF-kB signaling and the activation of Nrf2. Similarly, the anthocyanin extract prepared from dark sweet cherry was efficient in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells, including BT4747, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 through the downregulation of the Akt/mTOR route and Sirtl/survivin route [19]. Additionally, during atheroscelosis, anthocyanins were\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3934 3 of 29\nable to minimize the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein in arterial walls and the formation of foam cells, and thus inhibit the atherosclerotic plaque formation [20]. Due to inadequate bioavailability of both xanthones and anthocyanins in vivo, it is necessary to employ appropriate encapsulation techniques such as nanoemulsion to elevate the bioavailability, and thus the biological activity can be greatly enhanced. The advantages of nanoemulsion (10\u2013100 nm) application in food and drug industries have been well documented [21]: 1. the elevation of bioavailability of bioactive compounds; 2. the enhanced solubility of lipophilic bioactive compounds; 3. the rapid and efficient penetration of bioactive compounds into body; 4. the prevention of hydrolysis and the oxidation of bioactive compounds; 5. the masking of undesirable smells; 6. being a carrier of both lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds; 7. the elevation of therapeutic efficiency and the reduction of dosage intake so that the side effect can be minimized; and 8. the elevation of the stability of bioactive compounds in vivo. In addition, the incorporation of the targeting ligand into a nanoemulsion system encapsulated with bioactive compounds can effectively inhibit cancer cells by selective accumulation on tumor sites through the active targeting of receptors overexpressed in cancer cells. In line with this hypothesis, Rosso et al. [22] prepared glutaraldehyde-crosslinked hyaluronic acid submicron particles (200\u2013400 nm) by a non-solvent emulsion method and demonstrated their effective uptake by prostate cancer cells LNCaP without any significant toxicity and high accumulation of hyaluronic acid on a tumor site in a xenograft mice model through active targeting with CD44, a 85 kDa transmembrane receptor overexpressed in most tumor cells. Moreover, a bioactives-encapsulated nanoemulsion system conjugated with magnetic nanoparticles can be successfully used for both therapeutic and imaging applications. For instance, Vecchione et al. [23] reported that an oil-in-water nanoemulsion loaded with curcumin and magnetic cobalt ferrite oxide nanocubes could not only efficiently inhibit melanoma cancer cells B16-F10, but also be successfully applied for photoacoustic and magnetic resonance dual imaging. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 or nearly one in six deaths, with the most common cancers being breast, lung, colon and rectum, and prostate cancers [24]. However, in Taiwan, according to a report by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) [25], liver cancer ranks as the second cause of cancer death in Taiwan, with about 13,000 deaths from chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Based on a report by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the USA [26], liver cancer can be divided into primary liver cancer and secondary liver cancer, with the former further divided into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and hepatoblastoma, in which HCC is the most prevalent type of liver cancer in adults. Specifically, when hepatocytes, the main liver cells, are subjected to harmful conditions (hepatitis virus infections), it can cause hepatitis and lead to cirrhosis and ultimately to HCC [27]. The current therapies for HCC include surgery, liver transplantation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy [27]. However, tumor relapse and metastasis may occur after resection. Thus, the development of a new treatment method of liver cancer such as targeted therapy is important. The objectives of this study were to extract xanthones and anthocyanins from mangosteen peel for their identification and quantitation by UPLC-MS/MS. Additionally, both xanthone and anthocyanin nanoemulsions were prepared to study and compare their inhibition effects on liver cancer cells HepG2, with the possible mechanism being explored."

Comparatively, no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the total amount of xanthones was shown between methanol and ethanol, while a significantly higher content of total anthocyanins (p < 0.05) was found with methanol as the extraction solvent. For quantitation, a total of nine standard calibration curves including garcinone C, garcinone D, \u03b3-mangostin, 8-desoxygartanin, gartanin, \u03b1-mangostin, \u03b2-mangostin, cyanidin 3-sophoroside and cyanidin 3-glucoside were prepared, with the linear regression equations being y = 0.00861478x \u2212 0.0162142, y = 0.0206076x + 0.030393, y = 0.0138917x + 0.0235967, y = 0.0030961x + 0.00548724, y = 0.00237788x + 0.00480259, y = 0.026519x + 0.0020046, y = 0.00854577x + 0.0191585, y = 0.8167x\u2212 0.0108 and y = 1.5497x \u2212 0.0036, respectively, with R2 of all being higher than 0.99. Of the various xanthones, \u03b1-mangostin was present in the largest amount (51,062.21 \u00b5g/g), followed by \u03b3-mangostin (11,100.72 \u00b5g/g), gartanin (2398.96 \u00b5g/g), \u03b2-mangostin (1508.01 \u00b5g/g), 8-desoxygartanin (1490.61 \u00b5g/g), garcinone C (513.06 \u00b5g/g), and garcinone D (469.82 \u00b5g/g), while for anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sophoroside (2889.95 \u00b5g/g) was present at a much higher level than cyanidin-3-glucoside (19.72 \u00b5g/g). Thus, methanol was selected as the extraction solvent for subsequent nanoemulsion preparation and cell culture experiments. In several previous studies, both \u03b1-mangostin and \u03b3-mangostin were also reported to dominate in mangostin peels. For instance, Walker [6] reported the presence of \u03b1-mangostin and \u03b3-mangostin at 5.51 \u00d7 104 and 1.5 \u00d7 104 \u00b5g/g, respectively, in dried mangosteen peels produced by Xango Co in USA with 80% acetone as the extraction solvent. In another study with ethyl acetate as the extraction solvent, the contents of \u03b1-mangostin and \u03b3-mangostin were, respectively, 47.04 and 6.35 mg/g in dried mangostin peels produced in the eastern Thailand [1], while with methylene chloride as the extraction solvent the levels of \u03b1-mangostin and \u03b3-mangostin were 3323.88 and 860.17 mg/100 g in dried mangostin peels produced in Thailand and exported to Germany [29]. However, for anthocyanins, the cyanidin-3-sophoroside content was reported to be 1403 and 3126 mg/kg, respectively, at the 5th and 6th maturation stage [4]. Apparently, the difference in xanthone and anthocyanin contents from various mangostin peels can be attributed to variation in the growth location, harvest time, drying method, extraction solvent variety, and maturation stage."

Moreover, various trial studies based on the calculation of HLB (hydrophilic\u2013lipophilic balance) value were conducted to choose the appropriate surfactant/cosurfactant type and amount to stabilize the soybean oil containing xanthone or anthocyanin extract and obtain stable nanoemulsions. Figure 4 shows the appearance, particle size distribution and TEM image of xanthone and anthocyanin nanoemulsions. A transparent yellow appearance was shown for the xanthone nanoemulsion, with a concentration of 4000 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 4A) and 8000 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 4B), while a transparent red appearance was found for the anthocyanin nanoemulsion with a concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 4C) and 400 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 4D). The mean particle sizes of xanthone and anthocyanin nanoemulsions as determined by DLS were 22.5 and 14.4 nm, respectively (Figure 4E,F). Figure 4G,H and Figure 4I,J show the TEM images of xanthone and anthocyanin nanoemulsions, with the mean particle size being 25 and 15 nm, respectively, and round shape particles being observed for both nanoemulsions. Additionally, the PDI of xanthone and anthocyanin nanoemulsions were 0.229 and 0.153, respectively (Table 3), indicating that a narrow and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in both nanoemulsions was reached based on a report by Lakshmi and Kumar [34]. The zeta potentials of xanthone and anthocyanin nanoemulsions were \u221289.3 mV for the former as well as \u221239.4 mV (pH 2) and \u221261.5 mV (pH 3) for the latter (Table 3), revealing that a high stability of both nanoemulsions was attained as the zeta potential has to be controlled at >30 mV or <\u221230 mV to maintain the high stability of a nanosystem [35]. Compared to pH at 3, an increase in the zeta potential of the anthocyanin nanoemulsion at pH 2 is probably caused by a rise in hydrogen ions, leading to a decline of total negative charges.\nInt. J.

[37], with the former using coconut oil, Tween 80, Span 80, and ethyl acetate extract from mangosteen peel to prepare a xanthone nanoemulsion with the mean particle size at 181 nm, and the latter using corn oil, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, and ethanol extract from blueberry pomace to prepare a water-in-oil-in-water anthocyanin nanoemulsion with the mean particle size at 400 nm. Obviously, the difference in mean particle size of the nanoemulsion can be attributed to the variation in oil, surfactant and solvent varieties as well as the extraction method. Additionally, the encapsulation efficiency of xanthone and anthocyanin nanoemulsions was 96.8 and 81.7%, respectively, both of which was higher than that reported by Bamba et al.

A slight change in particle size, zeta potential and PDI was shown during heating at 40\u2013100 \u25e6C for 0.5\u20132 h and over a 90-day storage period at 4 \u25e6C (Tables 3 and 4), implying a high stability of the xanthone nanoemulsion prepared in our study. Similarly, for the anthocyanin nanoemulsion with pH at 2 or 3, only a slight change in particle size, zeta potential and PDI was observed, demonstrating a high stability of the anthocyanin nanoemulsion. However, compared to pH at 2, a much lower zeta potential was shown for the anthocyanin nanoemulsion with pH at 3 during heating (Table 3), revealing a higher stability of the anthocyanin nanoemulsion at pH 3. Thus, for the storage stability study, the anthocyanin nanoemulsion with pH at 3 was used. Interestingly, both particle size and PDI followed a time-dependent rise, while the zeta potential followed a time-dependent decline over a 90-day storage period at 4 \u25e6C (Table 4). Nevertheless, both PDI and zeta potential were within the acceptable range, and thus a high stability of the anthocyanin nanoemulsion was maintained during storage. The heating stability of the anthocyanin nanoemulsion prepared in our study was higher than that reported by Garcia et al. [38], who prepared anthocyanin nanoemulsion from Jaboticaba peel and the mean particle size raised from 178 to 658 nm, PDI from 0.217 to 0.350, and zeta potential from \u22128.6 to \u22122.3 mV during heating at 25\u201380 \u25e6C. This phenomenon indicated that, during heating, the nanoparticles may flocculate or aggregate resulting in a rise in particle size, PDI and zeta potential, and thus the stability of the nanoemulsion system was reduced substantially.\nTable 4.

Furthermore, a significant decline (p < 0.05) in the viability of AML12 and HepG2 cells occurred when the blank xanthone nanoemulsion concentration was >0.5% and >1%, respectively. Thus, for subsequent experiments, the blank xanthone nanoemulsion was controlled at 0.5% to maintain the high cell viability of both AML12 and HepG2 cells. Specifically, following treatment with the blank anthocyanin concentration from 0.25 to 1%, no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the viability of both AML12 and HepG2 cells was observed; however, the viability of the AML12 cells significantly dropped (p < 0.05) to 84.06 and 64.68%, respectively, for the concentrations raised to 1.5 and 2%, as well as 87.61 and 77.47% for HepG2 cells.

A dose-dependent reduction in cell viability was found for both AML12 and HepG2 cells when treated with the \u03b1-mangostin standard at 6\u201310 \u00b5g/mL. However, by comparison, at the same dose, AML12 cells showed a higher viability than HepG2 cells, implying that \u03b1-mangostin standard possessed a higher toxicity against HepG2 cells. However, for xanthone extract and nanoemulsion, no significant difference (p > 0.05) in cell viability was observed for AML12 cells and HepG2 cells, with the doses at 2\u20136 \u00b5g/mL and 2\u20134 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Following a rise in the xanthone extract and nanoemulsion concentrations to 8 and 10 \u00b5g/mL, the AML12 cell viability diminished, respectively, to 47.16 and 8.80% for the xanthone extract, as well as 55.94 and 21.31% for the xanthone nanoemulsion. However, for HepG2 cells, a substantial decline in the cell viability was shown following treatment with \u03b1mangostin standard, extract and nanoemulsion at a dose \u22656 \u00b5g/mL. Furthermore, a lower cell viability of HepG2 was found for the xanthone nanoemulsion than for the xanthone extract when compared at the same dose, revealing that the former was more toxic toward HepG2 cells. Taken together, the concentrations of \u03b1-mangostin standard, xanthone extract and xanthone nanoemulsion can be controlled at 6 \u00b5g/mL to maintain the high viability of AML12 cells and reduce the HepG2 viability pronouncedly.

This outcome further demonstrated that the xanthone nanoemulsion was the most toxic towards HepG2 cells, followed by xanthone extract and \u03b1-mangostin standard. However, for AML12 cells, the xanthone extract exhibited the highest toxicity, followed by the xanthone nanoemulsion and \u03b1mangostin standard. Thus, for future clinical application, the xanthone nanoemulsion should be a more ideal candidate than the xanthone extract. In the literature reports, Cai et al.

This outcome indicated that both xanthone extract and nanoemulsion were effective in inducing the apoptosis of HepG2 cells, with the latter being more efficient. For the proportion of G0/G1 phase, a significant decline (p < 0.05) by 10.92, 11.41 and 13.58%, respectively, was found following treatment with the xanthone extract at 6, 8 and 10 \u00b5g/mL, as well as 17.17, 19.17 and 19.84% when treated with the xanthone nanoemulsion at the same doses. By comparison, xanthone nanoemulsion was more effective than xanthone extract in decreasing the proportion of the G0/G1 phase, probably caused by the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect for easier penetration into cells [33]. Similar to the sub-G1 phase, a significant rise (p < 0.05) in the S phase proportion by 1.48, 1.73 and 3.08%, respectively, was found for the xanthone extract at 6, 8 and 10 \u00b5g/mL, as well as 2.70, 3.11 and 3.21% for the xanthone nanoemulsion at the same doses, when compared to the control treatment. However, both xanthone extract and nanoemulsion showed a\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3934 17 of 29\nsimilar effect in increasing the S phase proportion. Interestingly, compared to the control, following treatment with xanthone extract or nanoemulsion at 6, 8, and 10 \u00b5g/mL there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the proportion of the G2/M phase. Collectively, a dose-dependent rise in the proportion of the sub-G1 phase and a dose-dependent decline in the proportion of the G0/G1 phase occurred for both xanthone extract and nanoemulsion treatments. Thus, it may be inferred that the cell cycle of HepG2 cells may be arrested at the S phase. As mentioned above, most studies are focused on the effect of xanthone standards, not xanthone extract or nanoemulsion, on inhibition of cancer cell growth. For instance, a dose-dependent decline in the proportion of the G1 phase was shown, while a dose-dependent rise in the proportion of the S phase was found following treatment of HepG2 cells with the xanthone standard at 2, 4 and 8 \u00b5M for 48 h. Similarly, for some other types of cancer cells, after the treatment of colon cancer cells COLO 205 with \u03b1-mangostin at 10, 20 and 30 \u00b5g/mL the proportion of the sub-G1 phase showed the most prominent increment, while that of G0/G1, S and G2/M phases were reduced to a minimum [43]. However, no definite conclusion was made regarding the arrest of COLO 205 cells at a certain phase. Nevertheless, the ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 were postulated to be arrested at S and G2/M phases following treatment with \u03b1-mangostin standard, as both proportions of S and G2/M phases showed a dose-dependent rise. Similarly, the medulloblastoma cells Daoy were postulated to be arrested at the G2/M phase after treatment with \u03b1-mangostin standard at 10, 15 and 20 \u00b5M, as evidenced by a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of the G2/M phase after 24 h incubation. Collectively, the arrest of liver cancer cells and some other types of cancer cells at a certain phase as affected by xanthone can be dependent upon xanthone variety, xanthone standard or extract, xanthone concentration, incubation time and the method of xanthone extract or nanoemulsion preparation.

Compared to the control treatment, a large decline in the proportion of viable cells was shown for both xanthone extract and nanoemulsion at 6, 8, and 10 \u00b5g/mL with a dose-dependent response. By comparison, the xanthone nanoemulsion was more effective than xanthone extract in decreasing the proportion of viable cells at the same dose. Conversely, all the proportions of early apoptosis, late apoptosis and necrosis cells rose substantially, especially for late apoptosis cells, following treatment with both xanthone extract and nanoemulsion at 2, 4 and 6 \u00b5g/mL. Specifically, a dose-dependent drop in the proportion of early apoptosis cells was found for both xanthone extract and nanoemulsion, with the proportion of the former being higher at the same dose. However, for the proportion of late apoptosis cells, a dose-dependent rise occurred for both xanthone extract and nanoemulsion, with the former proportion being lower at the same dose. This finding demonstrated that most HepG2 cells could undergo late apoptosis when treated with the xanthone nanoemulsion at 6, 8 and 10 \u00b5g/mL, while with the xanthone extract most HepG2 cells underwent early apoptosis at 6 and 8 \u00b5g/mL as well as late apoptosis at 10 \u00b5g/mL. Interestingly, the proportion of necrosis cells showed inconsistent change for the xanthone extract, but for the xanthone nanoemulsion a dose-dependent decline was found, with the former proportion being higher at 8 and 10 \u00b5g/mL. Comparatively, the xanthone extract was more effective than the xanthone nanoemulsion in inducing HepG2 cells to undergo necrosis. Nevertheless, a large proportion of HepG2 cells underwent late apoptosis following treatment with the xanthone nanoemulsion, probably caused by the EPR effect, as mentioned above.

J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3934 21 of 29\nIn several similar studies, the activities of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 also followed a dose-dependent increase after the treatment of HepG2 cells with \u03b1-mangostin standard at 5, 7 and 14 \u00b5M for 24 h [46]. Likewise, Jin et al. [44] used 95% ethanol to extract xanthone from the bark of Garcinia xanthochymus and observed a dose-dependent rise in the activities of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 following the treatment of HepG2 cells with the xanthone extract at 6.25, 12.5 and 25 \u00b5mol/L for 12 h. It was postulated that, with the xanthone extract treatment, caspase-8 was activated first for the subsequent signal transduction to mitochondria for the regulation of the BcL-2 family, which in turn activated caspase-9 in cytoplasm, leading to caspase-3 activation for apoptosis execution. Taken together, a total of seven xanthones and two anthocyanins isolated from mangosteen peel were quantified by UPLC-MS/MS, followed by preparation of nanoemulsions and the evaluation of their inhibition effects on liver cancer cells HepG2. The xanthone nanoemulsion was shown to be more effective in inhibiting HepG2 cells than xanthone extract, while anthocyanin nanoemulsion at the same concentration failed to inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells. The inhibition mechanism of HepG2 cells by xanthone extract and nanoemulsion revealed cell cycle arrest at S phase, accompanied by a higher proportion of late apoptosis cells and an increase in caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities, resulting in cell apoptosis. Future studies can be directed towards evaluating the anti-tumor effect in vivo, as well as modifying the nanoemulsion system by incorporating a ligand such as hyaluronic acid for active targeting CD44 receptors overexpressed in liver cancer cells, as pointed out by Rosso et al. [22]. Additionally, based on a report by Vecchione et al. [23], the nanoemulsion system can be modified by incorporating magnetic nanoparticles such as iron oxide or cobalt ferrite oxide for exerting both therapeutic and imaging efficiency. On the other hand, nanoemulsions with high loading of anthocyanin can be prepared for evaluating the inhibitory effects on the growth of liver cancer cells HepG2. This is because anthocyanin-encapsulated nanoemulsion can reduce the potential side effects of cardiotoxicity caused by some common chemotherapeutic drugs, including doxorubicin [47]. It is worth pointing out that anthocyanins have been reported to exhibit cardioprotective effects by exerting antioxidant activity through reducing oxidative stress in cardiac cells, and anti-inflammatory activity through preventing the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as protecting the heart from ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury through the activation of signal transduction pathways, and sustaining mitochondrial function through the reduction of cytosolic cytochrome C, as well as the maintenance of electron transfer between NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome C [47\u201349]."

With methanol as an extraction solvent, a higher content of total xanthone and total anthocyanin can be obtained. The xanthone nanoemulsion composed of soybean oil, Tween 80, CITREM and deionized water, as well as the anthocyanin nanoemulsion composed of ethanol, soybean oil, PEG400, lecithin, Tween 80, glycerol and deionized water, are successfully prepared with high storage and heating stability of both. The IC50 of xanthone extract and nanoemulsion in inhibiting HepG2 cells are, respectively, 6.23 and 5.78 \u00b5g/mL, while that of the anthocyanin extract is 727.05 \u00b5g/mL, with the anthocyanin nanoemulsion showing no inhibition effect. Following the treatment of HepG2 cells with xanthone extract or nanoemulsion, the cell cycle may be arrested at S phase, with the latter inducing a much higher proportion of late apoptosis cells accompanied by a rise in the activities of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9, leading to cell apoptosis. Taken together, xanthone nanoemulsion showed a more pronounced effect in inducing the apoptosis of HepG2 cells than xanthone extract.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.-H.C.; Methodology, R.L., B.S.I. and B.-H.C.; Formal analysis, R.L. and B.S.I.; Investigation, R.L. and B.S.I.; Data curation, B.-H.C., R.L. and B.S.I.; Validation, B.-H.C., R.L. and B.S.I.; Software, R.L. and B.S.I.; Visualization, B.-H.C., R.L. and B.S.I.; Writing\u2014original draft, B.-H.C. and R.L.; Writing\u2014review and editing, B.S.I. and B.-H.C.; Funding acquisition, B.-H.C.; Resources, B.-H.C. and B.S.I.; Project administration, B.-H.C.; Supervision, B.-H.C.
