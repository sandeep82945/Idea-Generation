Phone: +34-972-418912.\nAromaticity plays an important role in chemistry, despite the fact that it is a concept with a somewhat imprecise definition1, 2, 3. It is commonly accepted that aromatic compounds are particularly stable and unreactive, whereas anti-aromatic compounds are known to be unstable and reactive. The presence of (anti)aromatic reactants, intermediates, transition states or products therefore has a great influence on reaction mechanisms4.\nIn his initial investigations into the particular stability of conjugated molecules, H\u00fcckel explained it through his molecular orbital (MO) theory. He showed that a specific number of \u03c0-electrons endowed benzene and related compounds with a closed-shell electronic structure that increased their stability5. This work led Doering and Detert, in 1951, to establish the first rule of aromaticity \u2014 the now-famous 4n+2 \u03c0-electron rule, widely known as \u2018H\u00fcckel\u2019s rule\u2019, which states that annulenes with 4n+2 \u03c0-electrons are aromatic \u2014 based on their application of H\u00fcckel\u2019s MO theory to monocyclic \u03c0conjugated molecules and, in particular, to the cycloheptatrienylium ion6.\nSince then, a variety of rules have been proposed to determine if a molecule is aromatic. These allow chemists to better understand molecules and their behaviour, as well as identify the formation or elimination of (anti)aromatic species in a reaction, which helps understand and predict possible outcomes. This article will first briefly discuss the most widespread rules associated with different types of aromaticity, then draw attention to their limitations, and finally propose future directions for the development of this fascinating topic.\n1.- Most common forms of aromaticity"

            "text": "Most of the typical aromatic compounds have high symmetry and degenerate MOs with either a closed-shell structure or a last shell half-filled with same-spin electrons. Either of these two electronic distributions provide an extra stability that is the basis of aromaticity. In the case of monocyclic molecules with the maximum number of conjugated bonds (annulenes, CnHn) with DNh symmetry, the most stable MO has all 2pz-atomic orbitals with in-phase overlap (Figure 1a,i; 2pz-atomic orbitals are shown for benzene). The rest of the MOs are doubly degenerated, except for the highest-energy one for annulenes with even n values (see the MO diagram for benzene in Figure 1a,i). With this MO distribution, closed-shell electronic structures are obtained with 2, 6, 10, 14\u2026 \u03c0-electrons \u2014 that is, with 4n+2 \u03c0-electrons (n = 1, 2, 3\u2026), as per the H\u00fcckel rule5. The synthesis of the cycloheptatrienyl cation (C7H7 +) in 1954 by Doering and Knox7 \u2014 which indeed showed a large \u201camount of resonance stabilization\u201d \u2014 represented one of the first successful experimental confirmations of this rule. Cyclic DNh annulenes with 4n \u03c0-electrons are antiaromatic 8."

            "text": "Notably, these 4n+2 or 4n \u03c0-electron counting rules for aromatic or antiaromatic annulenes, respectively, were found to depend on the spin-state of the molecules as well as their molecular topology. For example, 50 years ago, Colin Baird showed9, 10 that when cyclic DNh annulenes are in their lowest-lying triplet excited state (T1), it is those with 4n \u03c0-electrons (leading to a last shell half-filled with same spin electrons) that have an aromatic character, whereas those with 4n+2 \u03c0-electrons possess an antiaromatic character (as an example, see Figure 1b for the \u03c0-orbital occupation in cyclooctatetraene\nin its lowest triplet excited state, showing Baird aromaticity). The validity of the \u2018Baird rule\u2019 was confirmed by analysis of the planar triplet ground states of some cyclopentadienyl cations11. Recent spectroscopic observation of the triplet diradical state of cyclobutadiene12 and isolation of a triplet benzene dianion13 have also provided additional support for this rule.\nIn 2008, Soncini and Fowler14 further extended both rules to high spin states by stating\nthat annulenes of 4n+2 -electrons at the lowest-lying electronic states with even spin\n(singlet, quintet, ...) and those of 4n-electrons at the lowest-lying states with odd spin\n(triplet, septet, ...) are aromatic. Interestingly, by considering the \u03b1 (S = 1/2) and \u03b2 (S = -1/2) electrons separately, Mandado et al.15 showed that the H\u00fcckel and Baird rules as well as the Soncini-Fowler extension can be fused into a single rule asserting that annulenes with an odd number (2n+1) of \u03b1 and of \u03b2 electrons are aromatic, while those with an even number (2n) of \u03b1 and of \u03b2 electrons are antiaromatic. For instance, Figure 1b shows the electronic configuration of \u03c0-electrons in the aromatic triplet state of cyclooctatetraene. As can be seen the number of \u03b1 electrons (five arrows in red) and the number of \u03b2 electrons (three arrows in blue) are odd numbers. In the case of an annulene with an even number of \u03b1 electrons and an odd number of \u03b2 electrons (or the other way round), electron counting does not offer any clue about its global aromatic character."

            "text": "Another fascinating phenomenon is M\u00f6bius aromaticity, which is found in cyclic conjugated species that have a molecular topology resembling that of a M\u00f6bius strip. M\u00f6bius aromaticity was first described theoretically by Craig and Paddock16 for\norganometallic systems in 1958 and six years later was further elaborated by Heilbronner for annulenes17. MOs in M\u00f6bius aromatic species have an odd number of out-of-phase overlaps (see Figure 1a,ii). In monocyclic M\u00f6bius aromatic species, the closed-shell aromatic electronic configuration is reached with 4n \u03c0-electrons.\nExperimentally, this type of aromaticity was first reported in 2003 by Ajami, Herges et al.18 with the synthesis of the first stable M\u00f6bius aromatic molecule. Four years later, St\u0119pie\u0144 et al.19 synthesized the first dynamic H\u00fcckel\u2013M\u00f6bius system (Figure 1c). The M\u00f6bius conformer has a figure-eight structure with a single twist. In metalla-aromatic annulenes, one can have M\u00f6bius aromaticity without the need to incorporate a twist in the molecular structure (the so-called Craig\u2013M\u00f6bius aromaticity20, Figure 1a,iii).\nOttosson et al.21 proposed the \u2018aromaticity cube\u2019 shown in Figure 1d to condense the several combinations of (anti)aromaticity in annulenes depending on the number of \u03c0electrons (4n vs. 4n+2), topology (H\u00fcckel vs. M\u00f6bius), and electronic-state (S0 vs. T1/S1). Finally, a generalization of the H\u00fcckel and M\u00f6bius rules can be achieved through the linking number (Lk) that represents the number of times that an annulene winds (taking into account both writhes and twists)22. As an example, two strips Lk = 1 and two with Lk = 3 (which feature distinct strip winds) are illustrated in Figure 1e. Cyclic conjugated annulenes that have an even Lk follow H\u00fcckel\u2019s rule of aromaticity, whereas those having an odd Lk obey M\u00f6bius\u2019 rule."

In\nthese systems, aromaticity is much more complex than in organic molecules because\nthey possess not only -electron delocalization, but also -, - or even -electron\ndelocalization. In addition, they can combine different types of aromaticity at the same time, thus giving rise to double or triple aromaticity, which is referred to as \u2018multifold aromaticity\u201923. For instance, the Al4 4- ring in the triplet state of Li3Al4 - cluster is -Baird\naromatic with 4-electrons as well as r radial and t tangential H\u00fcckel aromatic with two electrons in each of its r and t orbitals 24 (see Figure 1f for the molecular structure and electronic configuration of Al4 4-).

            "text": "The H\u00fcckel rule holds strictly only for monocyclic \u03c0-conjugated systems in their ground states such as benzene and cyclooctatetraene. It was noticed early on that their polycyclic counterparts (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) do not obey this\nrule. Pyrene, for example, is aromatic despite its 16 -electrons (Figure 2a). A first\nattempt to extent the H\u00fcckel rule from monocyclic annulenes to PAHs was Platt\u2019s ring perimeter model26, which divided PAHs into two parts: a perimeter and an inner core. The aromatic character of the PAH was considered to be that of the annulene of the\nperimeter (14 -electrons in pyrene). This simple adaptation of H\u00fcckel\u2019s rule, however,\nfails to account for the aromaticity of many non-benzenoid polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs), for instance that of bicyclodeca[6.2.0]pentaene (Figure 2b).\nThe -sextet rule, proposed in 1972 by Clar27, 28 to describe aromaticity in benzenoids\n(PAHs containing only six-membered rings), proved to be a more versatile model. In this model, aromaticity is regarded as a local property of six-membered rings. An\naromatic -sextet is defined as a single benzene-like ring, with six localised -electrons\nseparated from adjacent rings by formal CC single bonds. For instance, the resonance\nstructure (i) of phenanthrene (in red) in Figure 2c has one more -sextet than (ii) (in\nblue), which according to the Clar model means that it represents a more realistic description of the molecular structure and aromaticity of phenanthrene.\nAn alternative to the Clar rule is the Fries rule29 that is mostly used to determine the dominant Kekul\u00e9 structure, which is the one possessing the maximum number of Fries sextets (rings that contain formally six \u03c0-electrons). The main difference between the Clar and Fries sextets is that the \u03c0-electron pair from a C=C double bond shared by two adjacent rings can be assigned to both rings.\nIn 1984, Glidewell and Lloyd30 extended the Clar rule to PCHs by stating that the total\npopulation of -electrons in conjugated polycyclic systems tends to form the smallest\n4n+2 groups and avoid the formation of the smallest 4n groups. Application of the Glidewell-Lloyd rule to bicyclodeca[6.2.0]pentaene (Figure 2b) for example leads to the\nconclusion that the resonance structure (i) in red (one small \u201c4n+2\u201d 2-electron ring and\none large \u201c4n\u201d 8-electron ring) is more relevant than that in (ii) blue (one small \u201c4n\u201d\n4-electron ring and one large \u201c4n+2\u201d 6-electron ring) to explain the electronic and\nmolecular structure of this species \u2014 something that could not be predicted using Clar\u2019s rule. Interestingly, Baird\u2019s and Clar\u2019s rules can be combined to explain the triplet state energies of PCHs with fused 4n- and (4n+2)-electron rings31. For instance, the\nsinglet\u2013triplet energy gap is reduced by 1.7 eV when going from the linear dibenzo[b,h]biphenylene to the kinked dibenzo[a,i]biphenylene (Figure 2d). This reduction can be explained by the presence of an additional triplet biradical Baird-\naromatic -quartet (at the central 4-membered ring) in the kinked isomer compared to\nthe linear isomer (in addition to the two H\u00fcckel-aromatic -sextets, shown in red),\nstabilizing the kinked isomer."

Closo boranes, [BnHn] 2-, are 3D aromatic clusters that have a structure of polyhedron with triangular faces (Figure 2e, left, depicts [B12H12] 2-). Electroncounting rules to rationalize the molecular structure and electronic configuration of such borane and carborane clusters were established, notably the Wade 2N+2 and Mingo 4N+2 electron rules34, 35, where N is the number of vertices of the polyhedron. Since Wade\u2019s rule refers to the skeletal electrons (all valence electrons except for those of the B\u2013H bonds), whereas Mingos\u2019 also incorporates the exo electrons of the B\u2013H bonds, the two rules are actually equivalent. For instance [B6H6] 2-, with its 26 valence electrons, obeys the Mingos rule (N = 6) but with 14 skeletal electrons (26 valence electrons \u2013 12 involved in the 6 B\u2013H bonds) it also follows the Wade rule (N = 6).\nThe Wade\u2013Mingos rule is not applicable to condensed polyhedral boranes, i.e., borane clusters made by the fusion of more than a single borane cluster (see Figure 2e, right, for an example of [B12H10] 2-, a borane made from the fusion of two [B7H7] -2 clusters). To determine the aromaticity of fused boranes (or condensed polyhedral boranes), Jemmis et al.36 proposed an extension in the form of the mno rule. It states that the number of skeletal electron pairs required for a condensed polyhedral borane to be\naromatic is given by m+n+o (here m = number of sub-clusters, n = number of vertices, o = number of single-vertex shared condensations in the polyhedral borane). Interestingly, although the Wade-Mingos rule is followed by Zintl ions such as [Sn12] 2- 37, 38, it does not apply to 3D spherical aromatic compounds such as some charged fullerenes. For these systems, the Hirsch 2(N+1)2 rule of aromaticity39 has been developed. It is based\non the fact that the -electron system of a roughly spherical species can be, in a first\napproximation, considered as an uniform electron gas surrounding the surface of a sphere. This leads to an MO distribution such as that shown in Figure 2f. For these systems, closed-shell configurations are thus reached for 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72\u2026 electrons. According to the Hirsch rule, icosahedral C20 2+, C60 10+ or C70 2- are aromatic fullerenes39. In the same way that Baird\u2019s 4n rule represented the extension of H\u00fcckel\u2019s 4n+2 rule to lowest-lying triplet states, those spherical systems having a same-spin halffilled last energy level with the rest of the levels being doubly filled should be aromatic. This open-shell spherical aromaticity40 is reached when the spherical compounds have 2N2+2N+1 electrons and with a spin S = N+\u00bd, as is the case for C60 -1 with S = 11/2.\nIn a similar fashion, the observed experimental abundances found in experimental mass spectra of alkali, alkaline earth metals, and gold clusters of 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 40\u2026 atoms were successfully explained with the spherical jellium model41. In this quantum mechanical model, the positive charges of the nuclei and the electron density are assumed to be uniformly distributed in a sphere. The energy levels of valence electrons for such a model are 1S21P61D102S21F142P61G182D10... and, therefore, with 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 40\u2026 electrons one gets a closed-shell electronic structure (see Figure 2g), and, consequently, can be considered jellium aromatic. This led to the formulation of\nan open-shell jellium aromaticity rule42. It is worth noting that both the WadeMingos and the jellium rules refer to the inner aromaticity of skeletal valence electrons of the cage, whereas the Hirsch rule describes the outer aromaticity of the \u03c0-electrons delocalized on the surface of the spherical species.\nIn some large cylindrical molecules such as nanotubes, cycloparaphenylenes, or certain boron and boron nitride clusters, among others, the aromaticity can be described by the hollow cylinder model (HCM)43. Solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a particle in this HCM gives MOs that can be separated into radial (located in the different layers of the cylinder and perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and tangential (located in the outer part of the cylinder and parallel to the cylinder axis, see Figure 3). This distribution gives rise to the 4n+2m rule of radial and tangential aromaticity, n and m being the number of degenerated and non-degenerated MOs, respectively. Finally, certain orbital occupations have been associated with disk44, cubic45 or tetrahedral46 aromaticities.\n2.- Limitations of the rules To quote Prof. Frenking at the 11th Congress on Electronic Structure: Principles and Applications held in Toledo, referring to the 18-electron rule: \u201cRules are rules but no laws. They can be broken\u201d. Indeed, although aromaticity rules are in many cases used as a \u2018back-of-an-envelope\u2019 tool for the rationalization of the physicochemical properties of many compounds, their scope is limited. A discussion of a few specific limitations of these rules can serve to highlight this.\n1. The electron counting rules are useful to identify (anti)aromatic compounds but they cannot provide a quantitative measure of (anti)aromaticity.\n2. Aromatic rings exist that cannot be classified as either H\u00fcckel or Baird because they are a combination of both. This is the case of TMTQ (see Figure 4a), a molecule featuring a 1,6-dimethylenemethano[10]annulene (M10A) ring exo-substituted with two 5- dicyanomethyl-thiophene moieties at the peripheries. In its singlet ground state (S0), TMTQ has a quinoidal structure (see Figure 4a, left) and exhibits a small singlet-triplet\nenergy gap (EST) of only 4.9 kcal/mol. The high stability of the T1 state of TMTQ can\nbe explained either through the Baird-aromaticity of the central ring, with its 8-electron 1,6-methano[10]annulenyl dication moiety (M10A2+, see Figure 4a, right, ionic structure)\nor through the H\u00fcckel-aromaticity of a closed-shell 10-electron H\u00fcckel-aromatic ring\nand two terminal dicyanomethyl radicals (see Figure 4a, center, diradical structure). Calculations suggest that the M10A ring in the T1 (and S1) state of TMTQ is about 85% H\u00fcckel and 15% Baird47.\n3. A similar situation is found in some metallacycles that cannot be classified exclusively as H\u00fcckel or Craig-M\u00f6bius (see Figure 4b, which represents any metallabenzene, for example IrI(C5H5)(PPh3)2) because they have a hybrid H\u00fcckel-M\u00f6bius character 48, with different contributions of both H\u00fcckel and Craig-M\u00f6bius aromaticities.\n4. Moreover, especially in metallacycles, electron counting is often not straightforward. For example, the six-membered ring of metallabenzenes (for instance that of (PPh3)2Os(C5H5)(CO)2 +) has been considered H\u00fcckel aromatic with 6\u03c0- or 10\u03c0-electrons or M\u00f6bius aromatic with 8\u03c0-electrons49. The different electron counting is due to disputable participation of the metal d orbitals in \u03c0-bonding.\n5. The (anti)aromatic character of annulenes has also been shown to fade away quite rapidly as their ring size increases50. Annulenes with large rings have negligible aromatic stabilization energies irrespective if they follow the H\u00fcckel rule or not51, 52, 53.\n6. C80H30 is a nonplanar nanographene that contains five- and seven-membered rings. For this species, the presence of a \u03c0-aromatic circuit (a circuit with a high electron delocalization) that has formally 75 \u03c0-electrons has been reported54, which does not follow any of the known rules of aromaticity. It is likely that this situation is not unique and can be present in other nanographene flakes.\n3.- Future directions\nSince H\u00fcckel's rule was first proposed, new rules of aromaticity and new connections between these rules have continuously been established in an attempt to capture the concept of aromaticity and explain and quantify its impact on the reactivity of chemical\ncompounds. The identification of nanographene flakes or non-alternant PAHs with new\nmolecular motifs possessing useful properties \u2014 such as tuned EST for organic optoelectronics applications (for example as materials for singlet fission, thermally activated delayed fluorescence or for triplet\u2013triplet annihilation) \u2014 or strong noncovalent complexation in supramolecular chemistry is a growing area of molecular design.\nAs previously stated, applying H\u00fcckel's rule to PAHs was initially not straightforward and necessitated the development of the Clar \u03c0-sextet model. Similarly, applying Clar's rule to nanographenes with rings of different sizes is challenging and will require further research. The rules that govern the local and global aromaticity in nanographene flakes or non-alternant PAHs are not completely understood and this will be for sure a highly active area of experimental (with AFM and STM images) and theoretical of research in the future. These developments are necessary because some of these nanographene flakes are of low stability and as such are difficult to synthesize and not useful in practical applications. Nanographenes with increased stabilities could be prepared if we knew how to increase their aromaticity.\nIn a similar manner, the H\u00fcckel and Baird rules of (anti)aromaticity did not hold in large annulenes. Preliminary results seem to point out that the Soncini and Fowler generalization of the H\u00fcckel-Baird rules to high spin states may also not be followed when the states considered have spins larger than 2 or 355. The generalization of the H\u00fcckel and M\u00f6bius rules with Lk is likely to fail for large Lk because annulenes after several writhes and twists may lose electron delocalization capability due to the reduction of efficient 2pz overlap. Similarly, Hirsch\u2019s rule seems applicable only to species with 50\n-electrons or fewer56. These results highlight again the limits of the electron-counting\nrules and the need to clearly establish them.\nPerhaps more important than drawing up different rules for different situations or classes of compounds is the idea to generalize the existing rules and connect them to each other, through different formulas and procedures57. This has long been a concern in aromaticity research. Examples of this are Mandado\u2019s rule, which unifies the H\u00fcckel, Baird, and Soncini-Fowler rules, or the Ottosson cube that connects the H\u00fcckel, Baird, and M\u00f6bius rules and their extensions (Soncini-Fowler and linking number rules). Similarly, the H\u00fcckel and Hirsch rules can be connected by the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a particle in an n-dimensional sphere (for n = 2 and 3, respectively)58, and the (4n+2) H\u00fcckel and Wade-Mingos rules by the so-called electronic confined space analogy59. In this analogy, any classical 2-dimensional annulene such as cyclopentadienyl anion (Figure 4c) can be transformed into a closo borane cluster by electron transmutation (eT, change of C by isoelectronic B-), adding a BH4+ sacrificial agent (sA), and allowing structural relaxation (sR). In the whole process, the total number of valence electrons remains constant (TNVE = 26)59, which highlights the equivalence between the \u03c0 and 3D aromaticities of these systems.\nAll these connections represent steps forward on the road to a unified theory of aromaticity, which in turn would help better capture this key concept in chemistry and its implication on molecules\u2019 reactivity.\nAcknowledgments\nThe following organizations are thanked for financial support: the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n (MICINN, project number PID2020-113711GB-I00) and the Generalitat de Catalunya (project number 2017SGR0039).
