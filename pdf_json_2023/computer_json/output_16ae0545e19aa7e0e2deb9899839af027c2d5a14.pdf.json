    "abstractText": "Introduction Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood, which can lead to serious health complications if left untreated [1, 2]. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body\u2019s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is a metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, such as obesity Abstract",

It is characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood, which can lead to serious health complications if left untreated [1, 2]. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body\u2019s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is a metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, such as obesity\nKeywords: Diabetes, Correlation, Deep learning, CNN, Health care, PIMA Indian diabetes, Machine learning\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

It is the most common type of diabetes, accounting for about 90\u201395% of all cases. People with type 2 diabetes either do not produce enough insulin or their bodies are resistant to it.\nDiabetes can lead to a variety of serious health complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy [4], and amputations [5]. It also increases the risk of developing certain cancers, such as endometrial, breast and colon cancer. However, with proper management and treatment, people with diabetes can live long and healthy lives. Treatment for diabetes typically includes monitoring blood sugar levels, making healthy lifestyle choices, and taking medications or insulin as needed. According to statistics, 463 million people globally have diabetes in 2019, with the number expected to rise to 578 million by 2030 and 720 million by 2045. As a result, the number of diabetic patients is expected to rise exponentially by 25% in 2030 and 51% in 2045 [6].\nAt present, early diagnosis of diabetes is performed manually by a physician doctor based on his or her expertise, experience, and observation of the condition. The healthcare industry currently gathers a large quantity of data, but this data may not necessarily disclose inherited hidden patterns, as is the case with genetic data. These manual judgments are, therefore, extremely deceptive and harmful, especially in the case of an early diagnosis, because some factors may be overlooked, resulting in a severe influence on the observations and consequences [7]. It is difficult to make accurate predictions about the onset of diabetes. However, while there is no protracted treatment for diabetes, it can be treated and managed if a correct diagnosis can be made early in the disease\u2019s progression. Moreover, early diagnosis of diabetes can help to avoid complications and reduce the likelihood of developing serious health problems. Thus, sophisticated early and automated diagnostic procedures are urgently needed to improve accuracy.\nThere are several machine-learning techniques that can be used for diabetic prediction, including:\n\u2022 Logistic Regression: This is a statistical method that can be used to predict the probability of a binary outcome, such as whether or not a patient has diabetes. \u2022 Decision Trees: This method involves creating a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, with the goal of predicting the outcome of a new patient based on their characteristics. \u2022 Random Forest (RF): This is an ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve the overall accuracy of the model. \u2022 Support Vector Machine (SVM): This is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression problems. \u2022 Neural Networks: This is a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that is designed to recognize patterns. They can be used for a variety of tasks, including diabetic prediction. \u2022 Gradient Boosting algorithm: This is an ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve the overall accuracy of the model.\nThese are some of the most popular machine-learning techniques that can be used for diabetic prediction. Still, it is important to note that the choice of technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. All the above\nmachine-learning techniques are dependent on manual feature extraction. Hence deep learning techniques came into existence for the purpose of classification with automatic feature extraction, but it is important to note that the choice of technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.\nThe primary contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 To increase the effectiveness of the classification method, we introduced a unique novel data modeling technique and integrated it with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for making accurate predictions about the onset of diabetes. \u2022 The proposed framework employs a pre-processing phase to get rid of duplicates, inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers for better understanding. \u2022 A reliable training strategy, such as 5-fold cross-validation, was performed to increase the method\u2019s universal effectiveness and minimize over-fitting. \u2022 The suggested data modeling framework improves performance and convergence time compared to other traditional methods in the literature. \u2022 Statistical analysis is utilized to validate the significance of the data modeling technique and that is recommended for use with various classifiers. \u2022 To show the proposed system\u2019s effectiveness, we compare it to numerous state-ofthe-art methods using various evaluation metrics.\nThe remaining of the paper is structured as follows: related works are discussed in Sects.\u00a01, and\u00a02 provides materials and methods such as dataset information, pre-processing, and a complete framework for data modeling. Section\u00a03 presents the experimental simulation, findings, and performance indicators. Section\u00a05 contains detailed discussions on potential work with various techniques and Statistical analysis. Finally, Sect.\u00a04 concludes the paper with a conclusion."

            "text": "In response to the rising diabetes epidemic, various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been developed to find hidden patterns in huge healthcare data sets. In recent years, various machine learning and deep learning frameworks for diabetes prediction have been presented [8\u201311]. Some researchers implemented diabetes prediction using ML techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [12], SVM [13, 14], Na\u00efve Bayes [15], Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [15], Nearest Neighbor (NN) [16] and RF [17] by utilizing a variety of dimensionality reduction and cross-validation approaches. Kumar et al. [18] used various classification techniques, including SVM, ANN, and classification tree, to predict type-2 diabetes and obtained an accuracy ranging between 73.00% and 80.00%. The major risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes were analysed by Miah et\u00a0al. [4]. More important parameters related to type-2 diabetes and its effects on QoL were identified using the technique of correlation analysis. The authors of [19] evaluated the efficacy of well-known machine learning approaches (ANN, K-NN, and decision trees) for diabetes mellitus prediction. Experiments were conducted on two databases, one obtained from a Frankfurt hospital and the other from an open-source PIMA Indian dataset. The results indicated that the best overall accuracy was 90.00\nIn addition, Tafa et\u00a0 al. [20] came up with a model that uses SVM and Naive Bayes together to predict diabetes. A set of data from three different places in Kosovo was used to test the model. The dataset includes 8 key attributes, and 80 of 402 people in the study had type 2 diabetes. In order to perform the validation test, they partitioned the dataset, so that half (50%) of it was used for the training set and the other half for the testing set. The authors reported that the accuracy of the SVM was 95.50%, while the accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier was 90.00%. An ANN model presented by authors in [21] can be highly valuable for healthcare officials and practitioners. The author was prompted by the disease\u2019s extremely deadly complication. They designed an ANN model for reducing the training error function. Therefore, the determined average error function was 0.01%, and the accuracy achieved by ANN was 87.30%. Soltani et\u00a0 al. [22] proposed a diabetic prediction system using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). The experiment was conducted using the Pima Indians Medical Diabetes (PIMA), and the data was split between 90% training and 10% testing. The proposed network achieved an overall training accuracy of 89.50% and a testing accuracy of 82.00%. Using factors such as sleep, routine, food, exercise, insulin, and heart rate, Rodrguez et\u00a0al. [23] used feature selection on diabetes (type 1) patients. For each feature, the authors used time-series data and the Sequential Input Selection Algorithm (SISAL) to rank the importance of the feature in relation to its predictive value for blood glucose levels.\nDeep learning has achieved significant advances in data processing [24], computer vision [25\u201327], and some other applications [28\u201332]. In recent years, experts have started recognising DL methods\u2019 potential for handling massive datasets [24]. Consequently, diabetes prediction has also been accomplished utilizing DL methods. Deep Neural Networks were utilised for the study by Ashiquzzaman et\u00a0 al. [33]. The architecture of the DNN is made of the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and the Radial Basis Function (RBF). The PIMA data set served as the basis for evaluating the method. The dataset is divided so that 192 samples are used for the testing set, while the remaining samples are used for the training set. The authors claimed that their findings were accurate 88.40% of the time. Further, Swapna et\u00a0al. [34] employed two DL approaches to increase diabetes prediction accuracy. Electrocardiograms were utilised to evaluate the performance of CNN and CNNLSTM using a private dataset. Using five-fold cross-validation, the dataset was divided into training and testing sets. Both models achieved an accuracy of 90.90% and 95.10% after being constructed. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was utilised by Ramesh et\u00a0al. [35] in order to make a prediction regarding the two forms of diabetes. The Pima Indian dataset, which consists of 768 samples and eight features, was employed by the authors. In order to verify the results of the study, the dataset was divided so that 80% would be used for training and 20% would be used for testing. The accuracy of diabetes type-1 prediction was 80.60%, whereas the accuracy of diabetes type-2 prediction was 75%. The many methods of diagnosing diabetes are outlined in Table\u00a01, which provides a summary of these methods.\nThe performance of the existing methods is limited to 80% in diabetic prediction. The main drawback is the availability of diabetic data is very less, but deep learning techniques require large data for better performance. Hence, the creation of synthetic data is required that looks similar to the original data but with different variations. This can"

Data augmentation techniques for one-dimensional data involve transforming the existing data in various ways to create new, synthetic data that can be used to expand the original dataset. Some examples of data augmentation techniques for one-dimensional data include:\n\u2022 Addition of noise: Random noise can be added to the data to simulate real-world variations. \u2022 Scaling: The data can be scaled up or down to create variations in the magnitude of the values. \u2022 Rotation: The data can be rotated around a certain point to create new variations. \u2022 Time shifting: The data can be shifted forward or backwards in time to create new\nvariations. \u2022 Interpolation: New points can be interpolated between existing data points to create\nnew data. \u2022 Re-sampling: The data can be re-sampled by reducing or increasing its frequency to\ncreate new variations. \u2022 Reverse: Reversing the data can be useful in some cases.\nAll the above traditional approaches are not able to provide better results. Therefore, feature-based correlation techniques are proposed to overcome the problems in the existing literature.\nMotivated by the earlier discussion, this article proposes a comprehensive data modeling framework for early diabetes prediction. Initial interest in data modeling originates from the correlation between attributes and outcomes. Furthermore, a number of MLbased algorithms were used to carry out the classification process. In addition, a deep CNN network is used with a data-modeling strategy for enhanced performance and substantial outcomes. PIMA dataset features were used for training the entire model. The proposed model can also help doctors make more accurate decisions for diabetes screening and early diagnosis based on the quality of the data."

The PIMA Indian dataset was utilized for this work, and it was\nobtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository (Available at https:// www. kaggle. com/ datas ets/ uciml/ pima- india ns- diabe tes- datab ase). This data was provided by the NIDDK [34], which is part of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The PIMA dataset included 768 females over 21 years old, 500 of whom were diabetic negative and 268 of whom were diabetic positive. The dataset has been widely used to estimate the risk of diabetes for each given observation based on the eight most influential independent features. This dataset is one of the most flexible, benchmarked, and trustworthy diabetes prediction datasets. Table\u00a0 2 offers a thorough overview of the dataset attributes."

Assuming that different classifiers have been evaluated using cross-validation on the same data set, the correlated paired t-test is the method that should be used in order to determine which one is superior [57]. In this work, statistical analysis is used to validate the importance of the data modeling technique that is recommended to be applied to various classifiers. A paired t-test is conducted on the same classifier with and without data modeling to examine the statistical significance of the difference between the two approaches. In order to apply paired t-test, 5-fold cross-validation on a single dataset is used to compute different test accuracies. The parameters of the suggested paired t-test were computed Eqs.

Therefore, in our proposed research, we designed a robust diabetic prediction model by combining a data modeling approach with ML and DL algorithms. Moreover, the significance of pre-processing has been examined, and it has been determined that it plays a crucial role in accurate and reliable prediction. However, the suggested research primarily focused on establishing a data modeling framework with the goal of providing more relevant data to the learning algorithm\u2019s input in order to improve accurate diabetes prediction among individuals. PIMA Indian Diabetes (PID) data from the UCI machine learning repository database was used in the experiment. During each test, both the original input dataset and the suggested redesigned dataset were used to validate the performance of the classification algorithms. Compared to the original dataset, it has been observed that the input dataset using the data modeling technique significantly improves the performance of the recommended ML models. Furthermore, the proposed data modeling framework was also applied to a sevenlayered deep CNN model and achieved promising accuracy of 96.13% for early prediction of diabetes. Overall, the proposed data modeling strategy enhanced the accuracy of all the suggested ML and DL models by an average of 10%. In the future, we plan to create a comprehensive system in the form of a website or mobile application that uses the proposed data modeling approach to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of diabetes.
