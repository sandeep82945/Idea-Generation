These materials, also known as biomaterials, can serve both as bone replacements and\ntargeted drug delivery systems for antibiotics. In this study, biomimetic nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) was\nsynthesized via the coprecipitation technique where waste chicken eggshell (WCE) was employed as the\nsource of Ca. Heat treatment was performed at four different temperatures (100 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, 600 \u00b0C and\n900 \u00b0C). Subsequently, the samples were characterized using XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, Raman\nspectroscopy, FESEM, EDX, XPS, DLS hydrodynamic size and zeta potential analysis. Also, their\nbiomedical effectiveness was evaluated in terms of cytotoxicity, hemolysis, antibacterial performance,\nand bioactivity. Doxycycline hyclate (DOXh) was loaded in the synthesized nHAp samples, and\nsubsequently its in vitro release was studied under stirring in simulated body fluid (SBF). The DOXh\nrelease kinetics was evaluated, and it was found that the first-order model was the best fitted kinetic\nmodel describing the release of DOXh from the nHAp samples, except for nHAp100, which was best\ndescribed by the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model. The nHAp synthesized utilizing WCE showed excellent\npotential for biomedical application and can be used as a drug delivery agent for antibiotics, such as DOXh."

This results in a traumatic experience, and patients with diabetes face the worst-case scenarios. Among the microorganisms responsible for osteomyelitis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-positive bacteria, has been found to be the most common (approximately 75% of all cases), with its virulence affecting various extracellular and cell-associated factors.3\u20135 In this case, to ght osteomyelitis, a combination of operative debridement, bone defect lling, and antibiotic therapy is usually used.6,7 Generally, antibiotic therapy is comprised of intravenous and oral administration for a period of approximately 3 weeks each, but nowadays it is for longer periods inmost cases.8\u201310 To ensure the necessary dosage of antibiotics at the infected sites, a high dosage is usually recommended given that the drugs have a very low efficiency of penetration from the blood stream to the targeted site.11,12\nThe prolonged administration of antibiotics at high dosages results in systemic toxicity together with detrimental effects on organs, such as the liver and kidney, in addition to the upsurge in antibiotic and multidrug resistance.13 One of the crucial reasons for antibiotic resistance is the formation of a biolm,\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36209\u201336222 | 36209\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Although non-biodegradable delivery systems have shown promising results, they are limited by the fact that the carrier needs to be changed or withdrawn, which is not the case for biodegradable local drug carriers.8,16 Biomaterials are the most preferred carriers when designing a biodegradable local drug delivery system and an amalgamation of biomaterial-antibiotic helps in treating osteomyelitis to a great extent.2,17\nHydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) has been recognized as a gold standard biomaterial due to its similarity in structure and behavior to human bone.18\u201325 In addition, hydroxyapatite (HAp) possesses superb biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, bioactivity, non-toxicity, non-inammatory properties, and excellent stability.26 HAp has already been investigated for the localized delivery of drugs such as ciprooxacin,27 amoxicillin,15 vancomycin,29 and gentamicin.28,30 The loading of drugs is carried out either via a facile adsorption process or solid-state mixing, where the latter is responsible for uncontrolled release of the drug. In this case, the existence of positively charged calcium and negatively charged phosphorus sites in HAp facilitates the adsorption process.2,31 Also, the synthesis of nano-sized HAp carriers makes the drug delivery system even more desirable due to the resulting superior loading and adsorption and more controlled delivery.\nIn our study, we synthesized nHAp using the coprecipitation method, employing chicken eggshells, a byproduct of poultry, as the source of calcium. To date, many studies have reported the superior workability of eggshell-derived nHAp compared to synthetic nHAp. The absence of certain minerals that constitute tooth apatite, inferior sinterability in terms of hardness and density, lower bioactivity, expensive raw materials, etc. are some of the shortcomings of synthetic nHAp, shiing the focus to the waste-derived synthesis of nHAp.32\u201334 nHAp was evaluated as a localized drug delivery carrier for DOXh, a potent broadspectrum antibiotic effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.35 DOXh is water-soluble and falls in the family of tetracyclines. Besides its widespread use in the treatment of skin infections such as chlamydia, cholera, and syphilis, DOXh has also found application in ghting osteomyelitis.5,36,37 Numerous studies have investigated the DOXh loading-release prole of synthetic HAp38 as well as scaffolds prepared by combining HAp with synthetic/natural polymer blends such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide),39\n36210 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36209\u201336222\npolycaprolactone/gelatin,40 alginate,41 collagen,42 and polylactic acid.43 However, none of these studies focused on the synthesis of bio-waste-derived HAp and the effect of calcination temperature on the loading and release of DOXh. The objective of this study was to analyse the adsorption of DOXh molecules on the surface of nHAp calcined at different temperatures, assess the drug release, investigate its impact on epithelial cells (cytotoxicity) and red blood cells (hemolysis), in vitro formation of an apatite layer and estimate its antibacterial properties. An alternative hypothesis is that the calcination temperature of nHAp has effect on the DOXh loading and release given that calcination results in changes in certain properties of HAp.44 Furthermore, the potential of bio-waste-derived nHAp to act as a local carrier of DOXh was evaluated, contributing to the scientic research in this eld."

The preparation of eggshell powder was reported in our previous work.45 Briey, the collected WCEs were washed thoroughly, boiled for 2 h, their membranes removed and oven dried. Subsequently, the dried eggshell fragments were ball milled at 450 rpm for 2 h, which produced ne eggshell powder.\n2.2.2 Synthesis of nHAp. The eggshell powder was subjected to calcination at 900 \u00b0C for a duration of 1 h at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min\u22121 to transform the CaCO3 in the eggshells into CaO.46 This process eliminated volatile impurities and organic membranes, resulting in the production of pure CaO. A quantity of 5.6 g of CaO was dissolved in DI water to create a 100 mL solution. This solution was stirred for 1 h, yielding a warm Ca(OH)2 solution. The exothermic reaction conrmed the formation of Ca(OH)2. A 0.6 M 100 mL solution of H3PO4 was prepared by dissolving 4.04 mL of H3PO4 in DI water. The gradual addition of H3PO4 to the Ca(OH)2 solution, while maintaining a Ca/P ratio of 1.67 led to the formation of a white precipitate of nHAp. The solution pH was controlled at around 11 by adding NH4OH, and stirring was continued for an additional hour. Aerward, the solution was allowed to age for 24 h, ltered, and subsequently dried in an oven. The resulting dried nHAp powder was divided into four parts and individually subjected to calcination at temperatures of 100 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, 600 \u00b0 C, and 900 \u00b0C, each for 30 min, at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min\u22121.

Simulated body uid (SBF), also known as metastable buffer solution, was prepared according to the work of Tas,47 which is a modied preparation method compared to the previously reported work of Kokubo et al.48 The modication was in terms of increasing the concentration of HCO3 from 4.2 mM to 27 mM, which eliminated the bicarbonate ion deciency associated with traditional methods. Also, the Cl\u2212 ion concentration was reduced from 147.8 mM to 125 mM given that human blood plasma contains only 103 mM of Cl\u2212 ions.49 Table 1 presents a summary of the preparation of the SBF solution (pH 7.4).\n2.2.4 Characterization.

The DLS hydrodynamic size and surface charge of the synthesized samples were evaluated using a Malvern Zetasizer Ultra. The assessment of surface chemistry was conducted using an XPS instrument (Thermo Scientic K-Alpha).\n2.2.5 Cytotoxicity study. The cytocompatibility of the synthesized nHAp samples was evaluated based on the cell viability of the Vero cell line, which is the extracted kidney epithelial cells of the African green monkey. The Vero cells (procured from ThermoFisher Scientic, UK) were maintained in Dulbecco's modied Eagle medium (DMEM), which was comprised of 1% penicillin-streptomycin (mixed in a 1 : 1 ratio), 0.2% gentamycin, and 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum). The Vero cells (1.5 \u00d7 104/100 mL) were seeded on a 96-well plate, and incubation was carried out for 24 h under 5% carbon dioxide at 37 \u00b0C.

The cell viability was calculated as follows:21\nCell viability \u00bc number of live cells Total number of cells 100% (7)\n2.2.6 Bioactivity study. The assessment of the bioactivity of the prepared nHAp samples involved the immersion of 100 mg of the sample in a 100 mL SBF solution, keeping it in a Duran bottle with lid, and placing it in an incubator for 3 weeks at 37 \u00b0 C. Aer 3 weeks, the samples were separated by decantation and oven dried. The dried samples were then analyzed by FESEM to conrm the formation of apatite on the nHAp surface.\n2.2.7 Antibacterial activity study. The assessment of the antibacterial effectiveness of the synthesized nHAp carriers (nHAp100, nHAp300, nHAp600, and nHAp900) was carried out using the agar-well diffusion technique51 against Escherichia coli (Gram \u2212ve, ATCC 11303) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram +ve, ATCC 9144). The bacterial colonies were grown in MuellerHinton broth (at 120 rpm and 37 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C). Sterile micropipette tips were used to create wells with a 6 mm diameter on the agar plates. The nHAp carriers (400 mg mL\u22121) together with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were loaded on the wells, which acted as a negative control. To serve as a positive control, a kanamycin disk with a 30 mg dosage was employed. The agar plates were kept at 4 \u00b0C for 3 h to counteract the penetration and diffusion of nHAp particles. Subsequently, the agar plates were placed in an incubator for a 24 h period, and the diameter of the inhibition zone was recorded.\n2.2.8 Hemolytic study. Human blood samples were obtained using heparin as an anticoagulant, and then subjected to incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The nHAp carriers were made into solutions of 400 mg mL\u22121 concentration using phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Then, each of the four samples was mixed with 0.4 mL of the incubated blood samples, and further incubated for 1 h. A similar procedure was followed, but without the addition of any nHAp carrier. In this case, PBS served as the negative control and deionized water served as the positive control. Following incubation, the samples underwent centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was collected, and its absorbance was quantied at 545 nm employing a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The absorbance data reects the release of hemoglobin as a result of red blood cell lysis, which could be used to assess the hemocompatibility of the nHAp carriers.52 The percentage of hemolysis in the blood sample can be computed using the following formula:53\n% Hemolysis \u00bc Dt Dnc Dpc Dnc 100 (8)\nwhere Dt = absorbance of the nHAp solution, Dnc = absorbance of the negative control and Dpc = absorbance of the positive control.\n2.2.9 DOXh loading study.

Aer sonication, the solutions were stirred in a magnetic stirrer for 2 h at 25\u00b1 1 \u00b0C. The nHAp samples were separated from the drug solution by vacuum ltration with a micro lter (Ultipor\u00ae 0.2 mm). The residues were washed a few times with DI and acetone to remove excess drug from the surface. The absorbance of the stock solution and the ltrates was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-2910) at 273 nm to calculate the DOXh loading capacity (eqn (9)) and entrapment efficacy (eqn (10)).54 A calibration curve was plotted to determine the unknown concentration of the drug.\nLoading capacity \u00f0%\u00de \u00bc total drug encapsulated Weight of carrier 100 (9)\nEntrapment efficacy \u00f0%\u00de\n\u00bc initial con: of drug conc: of drug in filtrate initial conc: of drug 100 (10)\n2.2.10 In vitro release study.

One isolated peak was observed at the diffraction angle of 11\u00b0, which corresponds to the (100) crystal plane of HAp. At the elevated temperature of 900 \u00b0C, no peaks of b-TCP (tri-calcium phosphate) were observed, conrming the mono-phasic nature of nHAp900.

            "text": "FESEM was used to perform the morphological investigation of the produced nHAp samples. Fig. 6a, d, g, and j present the FESEM images of nHAp100, nHAp300, nHAp600, and nHAp900, respectively. According to the images, the particles of nHAp100 exist in agglomerated form, and their shape includes a long cylindrical rod, which is irregularly structured.\n36214 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36209\u201336222\nAlternatively, less agglomerated particles were observed for the nHAp300, nHAp600, and nHAp900 samples. As the calcination temperature increased, several phenomena occurred, including sintering and grain growth, elevated thermal energy and particle mobility, elimination of defects and dislocations, Ostwald ripening, and redistribution of atoms. These processes contributed to the reduction in agglomeration and increase in crystallite size. This observation is consistent with the ndings reported in previous studies.68\u201370 In the case of calcination at 900 \u00b0C, smaller and more agglomerated particles sintered together and formed large agglomerates, causing the nHAp900 particles to be the largest among the samples.71 The particles of nHAp300 and nHAp600 were mostly cylindrical rod-shaped; however, shorter lengths with much wider particles were seen for nHAp600. Interestingly, the cylindrical rod shape was not seen for nHAp900; rather, rouletted, oval, and irregular at plate shapes were observed. Thus, with an increase in the calcination temperature, the cylindrical rod shapes were transformed into a more rouletted plate shape. The particle size of the samples was measured based on these images, following our previously reported protocol.72 A minimum of 50 discrete particles with a clearly detectable boundary were considered for each measurement. The nano-structured form of the samples was conrmed by the particle size histograms, as shown in Fig. 6b, e, h, and k. With an increase in the calcination temperature, the particle size of the samples also increased, with nHAp100 having the lowest particle size and nHAp900 having the highest particle size. This is consistent with the crystallite size variation extrapolated from the XRD analysis.\nThe elemental analysis of the samples was done in terms of EDX, as shown in Fig. 6c, f, i and l.

A peak for C (Ka) was detected, which originated from the carbon tape onto which the samples were placed. The Ca/P ratios of the nHAp samples based on EDX analysis are as follows: nHAp100 (2.18), nHAp300 (1.27), nHAp600 (1.37), and nHAp900 (1.64). The Ca/P ratio of nHAp900 is the closest to the theoretical Ca/P ratio of nHAp (1.67). This ratio was the highest for nHAp100, which then decreased with the calcination temperature, and eventually increased to 1.64 at 900 \u00b0C calcination. According to the work of Agbabiaka et al., the Ca/P ratio of waste poultry eggshellderived HAp calcined at 800 \u00b0C, 900 \u00b0C and 1000 \u00b0C was found to be 0.55, 1.26 and 1.65, respectively. An increase in the calcination temperature caused the Ca/P ratio to be much closer to 1.67 which was due to the presence of other phases, such as monetite and calcium hydrogen phosphate hydrate, limiting the achievement of the anticipated stoichiometry ratio.73 Opposite results were seen in the work by Sanosh et al., where the Ca/P ratio of sol\u2013gel-prepared synthetic nHAp was evaluated with respect to calcination temperature from 65 \u00b0C to 800 \u00b0C. Based on the results, the Ca/P ratio of nHAp calcined at 65 \u00b0C was very near to 1.67 but increased with an increase in the calcination temperature. The formation of minor amounts of CaO at temperatures of 700 \u00b0C and above caused this deviation in the Ca/P ratio from the theoretical value, which was also reported in other studies.74 In our study, the deviation in the Ca/P ratio may be due to several factors given that the amount of eggshell was taken based on the assumption of 97% Ca present in the eggshell. Besides, at 900 \u00b0C, nHAp became more crystalline and uniformly structured, which resulted in a Ca/P ratio closer to 1.67."

In the case of bio-materials such as HAp, the formation of apatite in contact with body uid is an exigent criterion when used as a bone-repairing material.78 The appearance of apatite elucidates the bone-bonding ability of bio-materials.2\nHerein, the bio-activity of the prepared HAp samples was evaluated by FESEM imaging analysis based on their immersion in SBF solution for 21 days. Taking a closer look at the FESEM images, as shown in Fig. 8, the formation of an apatite layer on the powdered nHAp samples was evident. The discrete particles of all the samples were found to be covered aer 21 days of immersion in SBF solution, which is due to the attachment of apatite to the nHAp particles. The deposition of an apatite layer on the nHAp particles is due to the interaction of the positive Ca and negative P sites in nHAp with the negative PO4\n3\u2212 and positive Ca2+ charged sites in SBF. The combination of the opposite charged sites induced the nucleation of apatite, and the continuation of this resulted in the super-saturation of the discrete nHAp particles by the apatite layer.2,78\u201380\n3.6.2 Cytocompatibility assessment.

As a gold standard biomaterial, the antibacterial property of HAp adds further value to its application. The antibacterial property of HAp is evident from the literature.21,82,83 Given that our synthesized nHAp samples were found to be nano-structured based on the particle size\n36216 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36209\u201336222\nmeasurements using the FESEM images, we explored their antibacterial activity, which will be an exciting addition of properties to the bio-material. Fig. 10 shows the results of the antibacterial activity of nHAp100, nHAp300, nHAp600, nHAp900, Kanamycin (positive control) and DMSO (negative control).\nCompared to the standard kanamycin (30 mg), the nHAp samples (400 mg mL\u22121) exhibited signicant antibacterial efficacy against both Gram \u2212ve (E. coli) and Gram +ve bacteria (S. aureus). The highest activity against E. coli and S. aureus was shown by HAp300 (14 nm) and HAp600 (14 nm), respectively. The antibacterial activity of kanamycin and HAp600 was the same for Gram-positive bacteria. A deeper look into the results revealed that the Gram-negative bacteria were slightly more susceptible to the HAp samples. Similar phenomena were also reported by Ragab et al.84\n3.6.4 Hemolytic study. Aer being implanted in the body, the nHAp carriers interact with plasma proteins and red blood cells (RBCs). Thus, it was important to study how blood interacts with the nHAp carriers in a specic environment. Fig. 11 represents the hemolytic study of the four HAp samples, each with a concentration of 400 mg mL\u22121 in PBS. As evident in this study, the nHAp carriers did not cause hemolysis in human RBCs. According to the ASTM standard, a hemolysis percentage of less than 5% is considered highly hemocompatible.85,86 The absence of hemolysis associated with nHAp is attributed to its structural similarity to natural bone and the presence of charged surface sites, which prevent interactions with red blood cells (RBCs).15\n3.6.5 In vitro drug release study.

A similar pattern was observed for the LC of the samples. With an increase in the calcination temperature from 300 \u00b0C to 900 \u00b0C, a gradual increase in EE and LC was obtained except for nHAp100.\nFig. 12b presents the in vitro DOXh release in SBF at 37 \u00b0C with respect to time.

In contrast, nHAp100 showed a higher initial release than the other samples until nHAp600 surpassed it aer 70 min. Overall, a higher release was found for nHAp600, followed by nHAp100 and nHAp300. Although HAp900 showed the highest EE and LC, its cumulative release percentage was the lowest among the nHAp samples.

Interestingly, no initial burst release of DOXh was observed for any of the nHAp samples, although nHAp100 showed a slightly higher release, which does not depict burst release. This may be due to the fact that our loading protocol involved continuous stirring of the powdered nHAp sample and the drug solution, followed by multiple washings of the drugloaded nHAp with DI and acetone, which eliminated the possibility of any slack binding of the drug molecules. Based on the observations, increased calcination temperatures lowered the release except for nHAp600. Thus, to achieve sustained release, nHAp900 will be the most suitable, having the highest loading and lowest release percentage.\n3.6.6 Drug release kinetic study. Drug release kinetics is an important phenomenon that needs to be considered for an effective understanding of the pattern of release of a drug. This knowledge also helps in understanding the interaction between carriers and drugs, which ultimately results in the design of an effective formulation.88 According to Dash et al., there are three categories of approaches for investigating the drug release kinetics, including statistical, model-independent, and modelindependent.89 Herein, we adopted model-dependent approaches for investigating the DOXh release kinetics of the synthesized nHAp samples.\n3.6.6.1 Zero-order kinetic model. The zero-order kinetic model represents the drug delivery system, where the release of drugs is constant and does not depend on concentration. This relation is exploited to describe the drug release of several pharmaceutical systems, such as transdermal, matrix tablet, and osmotic systems.89 The simplest form of this model is represented as follows:\nCt = Co + Kot (12)\nwhere Ct refers to the amount of drug released or dissolved at time t, Co is the initial amount of drug present in the solution (which is zero most of the time) and Ko is the zero-order rate\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36209\u201336222 | 36217\nTable 4 Kinetic model parameters for DOXh release from nHAp samples\nSample\nZero-order model First-order model Higuchi model Korsmeyer-Peppas model\nKo R 2 K1 R 2 KH R 2 KKP n R 2\nHAp100 0.2599 0.7578 0.01895369 0.8774 3.6156 0.6789 0.6529 0.9087 0.8878 HAp300 0.2782 0.7112 0.04833997 0.9889 3.7084 0.5761 0.0381 2.1524 0.8491 HAp600 0.4125 0.7628 0.0591871 0.9627 5.5417 0.6305 0.0140 2.7813 0.9316 HAp900 0.0393 0.7078 0.02171729 0.9253 0.5272 0.5826 0.2244 0.9282 0.7228\nFig. 14 FTIR spectra before and after DOXh loading on (a) nHAp100 and (b) nHAp900.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The gradient of the graph represents the zero-order rate constant (Ko), while the correlation coefficient determines the appropriateness of this kinetic model. The values of Ko and R\n2 are shown in Table 4.\n3.6.6.2 First-order kinetic model. Drug delivery systems in which the adsorption and/or elimination of drugs are associated and the rate of release is dependent on the concentration are better explained by this model. The most primitive form of the rst-order kinetic equation can be found in the report by Noyes et al.91 and the rst application of this kinetics used in drug dissolution was found in the work of Gibaldi et al.92 Typically the release of water-soluble drugs from porous materials is well described by this kinetic model,89 and its simplied form equation can be expressed as follows:\ndC dt \u00bc K1C (13)\nThis equation can also be expressed as\nlog C \u00bc log Co K1t 2:303\n(14)\nwhere K1 is the rst-order rate constant. The tting of the plot of log cumulative release% against time will result in a slope that is equal to \u2013K1/2.303. The plot is shown in Fig. 13b and the values of R2 and K1 are tabulated in Table 4.\n3.6.6.3 Higuchi kinetic model. Professor Takeru Higuchi introduced a mathematical equation that characterizes the release of drugs from matrix systems, specically addressing the release of both water-soluble and poorly soluble drugs from semi-solid and solid matrix systems.93,94 The simplied Higuchi model, which relies on Fickian diffusion principles, elucidates\n36218 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36209\u201336222\ndrug release kinetics by establishing a linear correlation between the cumulative drug release and the square root of time.2 The equation is as follows:\nC = KH \u00d7 t 1/2 (15)\nwhere C is the cumulative drug release% and KH is the Higuchi constant. The tting of the plot between cumulative drug release% against square root of time resulted in a linear relationship, as shown in Fig. 13c, where the slope represents the Higuchi constant. The values of KH and R\n2 of the HAp samples are tabulated in Table 4.\n3.6.6.4 Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model. To elucidate both Fickian and non-Fickian drug release from either swelling or non-swelling polymeric systems, Korsmeyer and Peppas introduced a pragmatic formula as depicted below:95\nC = KKP \u00d7 t n (16)\nwhere KKP is the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas constant and n refers to the diffusional exponent, which describes the drug release mechanism. The signicance of n is as follows: when n < 0.5, it represents quasi Fickian diffusion but n = 0.5 refers to Fickian diffusion; when n is greater than 0.5 but less than 1, it refers to non-Fickian diffusion; and when n = 1 and n > 1, it represents the case II transport and super case II transport, respectively.88 The tting of the plot between log cumulative release% and log time produced a linear relationship, as shown in Fig. 13d.\nThe kinetic parameters obtained from the model equations are represented in Table 4.\nThe best tted model was chosen according to the highest correlation coefficient (R2) value. According to the data obtained, the rst-order model is the best-tted kinetic model that describes the DOXh release from the nHAp samples, except nHAp100, which was best described by the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model. The value of n for DOXh release from nHAp100 and nHAp900 was 0.5 < n< 1, which depicts non- Fickian diffusion (non-swellable matrix diffusion). Alternatively, for nHAp300 and nHAp600, the value of n is greater than 1, which indicates super case II transport (relaxation/erosion drug release mechanism).88"

Fig. 14 represents the FTIR spectra before and aer DOXh loading of nHAp100 and nHAp900. In both cases, the predominant absorption band, which is due to the presence of the PO4\n3\u2212 group, shied towards the higher wavenumber region. This suggests the formation of hydrogen bonds between the nHAp and DOXh molecules.\nA shi in the binding energy (BE) aer DOXh loading was observed during the XPS analysis. Fig. 15 represents the XPS core level spectra of the major elements of nHAp100 and nHAp900 and the corresponding DOXh-loaded samples.\nThe deconvoluted core level spectra of Ca 2p for nHAp100 shows (Fig. 15a) a doublet separation of 3.52 eV (position of Ca 2p1/2 and Ca 2p3/2 at 350.48 eV and 346.96 eV, respectively).50 In the case of nHAp100-DOXh, a shi in the BE was observed, where Ca 2p1/2 and Ca 2p3/2 were observed at 349.93 eV and 346.39 eV with a doublet separation of 3.54 eV, respectively. In the case of nHAp900, Ca 2p1/2 and Ca 2p3/2 were observed at 350.66 eV and 347.14 eV (Fig. 15d) with a doublet separation of 3.52 eV, whereas aer DOXh loading, the peaks of Ca 2p1/2 and Ca 2p3/2 shied to 350.43 eV and 346.92 eV with a doublet separation of 3.51 eV, respectively. In both cases, the BE shied to a lower BE.\nIn the case of the P 2p XPS peak, both nHAp100 and nHAp100-DOXh showed spin\u2013orbit splitting into P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 with a doublet separation of 1.10 eV and 0.95 eV, respectively (Fig. 15b). In the case of nHAp900 and nHAp900-DOXh, this doublet separation was 1.01 eV and 0.90 eV, respectively (Fig. 15e). Both nHAp100 and nHAp900 showed a shi in BE aer DOXh loading. In the O 1s core level spectra of nHAp100 and nHAp900 and the corresponding DOXh-loaded samples (Fig. 15c and f, respectively), a shi in the BE was also evident.\nThis shi in the BE towards a lower energy for all the peaks aer DOXh loading depicts the chemical interaction of the Ca2+,\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "The present study investigated how DOXh is loaded in and released from nHAp that underwent calcination at four different temperatures. The synthesis of nHAp involved the utilization of WCE through the wet chemical precipitation method. With an increase in calcination temperature, a variation in the crystallographic parameters and loading and release was observed. The DOXh loading decreased as the calcination temperature of nHAp increased from 100 \u00b0C to 300 \u00b0C but increased for nHAp600, reaching its peak value for nHAp900. A shi in the characteristic peaks aer DOXh loading was observed by FTIR and XPS analysis, which depicted the chemical interaction of the nHAp carriers and DOXh. In the case of the release of DOXh, elevated calcination temperatures led to a decrease in its release, except in the case of nHAp600. Thus, to achieve sustained release, nHAp900 appears to be the most appropriate candidate due to its combination of the highest loading and lowest release percentage. Furthermore, the WCE-derived nHAp carriers were cytocompatible, hemocompatible, bioactive, and most importantly bactericidal against both Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacteria.\nAuthor contributions\nM.
