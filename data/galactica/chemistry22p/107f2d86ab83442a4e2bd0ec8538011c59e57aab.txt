Breast cancer is a common but serious and even lethal disease. Fortunately, compared with other cancers, breast cancer treatments currently are relatively well developed. The use of specific drugs is typically essential in the majority of breast cancer treatment strategies. Given the aforementioned factors, it is important to continue researching effective antibreast cancer drug design. Machine learning-based computer-aided drug design is currently a common practice in both drug industries and academic institutes. According to the characteristics of breast cancer, we selected multiple candidate compounds; based on the corresponding molecular descriptors, biological activities, and pharmacokinetic properties, a dataset of inhibition potency and pharmacokinetic properties paired with multiple features of compounds was constructed. On this basis, the random forest method was utilized to choose greater-influenced feature embeddings; thus, 224 main operating variables were selected for further analysis; we then employed the efficient MobileNetV3 deep neural network as the backbone to establish the prediction models for the inhibition potency and pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds. After data preprocessing, the weights are obtained by training on the refined dataset. Finally, we define an optimization problem to discover compounds with the best properties. The problem is solved using the genetic algorithm with the acquired prediction model, and the solution value for the corresponding operating variables with the best clinical properties in theory is then obtained. Analysis demonstrates that our approach could be used to aid the screening process of antibreast cancer drug candidates.  5. conclusion Breast cancer, as a common and influential disease, requires the development of new drugs to continuously improve the treatment methods.

candidates to reduce the cost of drug development has a certain research value. In our work, we consider the use of machine learning methods to assist in the selection of compounds. We first used the known knowledge and computer compound molecular descriptor calculation software to construct a dataset and then used the random forest algorithm to screen the features and simplify the dataset; then, based on the MobileNetV3 structural deep convolutional network, the biological activity and pharmacokinetics were constructed. The invention of novel medications is necessary for the ongoing development of effective treatments for breast cancer, a common and notable disease. There may be some research value in how to effectively choose potential medication candidates to lower the cost of drug development. In our study, we take into account the application of machine learning techniques to aid in compound selection. First, a dataset was created by combining already known inhibition potency knowledge and the compound molecular descriptors generated by modern calculation software. Next, features were screened out and the dataset was made simpler using the random forest algorithm. Finally, the MobileNetV3 structural deep convolutional network was introduced to construct the biological activity and pharmacokinetics. A genetic algorithm solver is utilized to solve an optimization problem based on the obtained prediction model to predict the best value for the chosen molecular descriptors. The analysis from the perspective of the entire drug design process, rather than constructing or modifying each child model, reflects the proposed modelâ€™s innovation and applicability the most. The internal connection and progressive relationship of each model are emphasized in many places throughout this paper. We believe that our four-step method of influencing variable screening, biological activity prediction modeling, pharmacokinetic properties modeling, and clinical property optimization can successfully model and optimize the properties of drugs through various machine learning technologies and serve as a useful guide for drug manufacturers. According to the aforementioned analysis, our method not only offers a significant practical industrial application value but also some academic innovation and research value. For example, for the properties of hERG, we do not want the drug to be highly toxic to the human body, so for toxic compounds, we will appropriately reduce its evaluation, that is, the calculated adaptation value. Other properties are the same, and we expect to obtain antibreast cancer drugs with better efficacy and less harm to the human body through this method.
