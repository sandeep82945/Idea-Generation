    "abstractText": "The San Carlo Colossus, known as San Carlone, is a monument constituted by an internal stone pillar support to which a wrought iron structure is attached. Embossed copper sheets are fixed to the iron structure to give the final shape to the monument. After more than 300 years of outdoor exposure, this statue represents an opportunity for an in-depth investigation of long-term galvanic coupling between wrought iron and copper. Most iron elements of the San Carlone appeared in good conservation conditions with scarce evidence of galvanic corrosion. In some cases, the same iron bars presented some portions in good conservation conditions and other nearby portions with active corrosion. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible factors correlated with such mild galvanic corrosion of wrought iron elements despite the widespread direct contact with copper for more than 300 years. Optical and electronic microscopy and compositional analyses were carried out on representative samples. Furthermore, polarisation resistance measurements were performed both on-site and in a laboratory. The results revealed that the iron bulk composition showed a ferritic microstructure with coarse grains. On the other hand, the surface corrosion products were mainly composed of goethite and lepidocrocite. Electrochemical analyses showed good corrosion resistance of both the bulk and surface of the wrought iron, and galvanic corrosion is not occurring probably due to the iron\u2019s relatively noble corrosion potential. The few areas where iron corrosion was observed are apparently related to environmental factors, such as the presence of thick deposits and to the presence of hygroscopic deposits that create localized microclimatic conditions on the surface of",

The 22 m high statue (which is positioned on an 11 m high granite pedestal) was manufactured by a peculiar construction technique: An internal stone pillar supports a wrought iron structure, embossed with fixed copper sheets. The iron structure, in direct contact with the copper sheets, provides structural support and shapes the statue. Due to its construction technique and more than 300 years of outdoor exposure, the statue represents an opportunity for an in-depth investigation of the longterm galvanic coupling between the wrought iron and copper. Despite the frequent direct contact between the two metals, wrought iron presents only a limited number of areas heavily affected by corrosion, while the rest looks in quite good conservation condition.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2072. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16052072 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2072 2 of 17\nIt has been reported that in a previous restoration, a protective coating was applied [1\u20133]. However, this coating is nowadays heavily deteriorated with large portions of the iron surfaces directly exposed to the atmosphere. The San Carlone statue, therefore, should be prone to galvanic corrosion. However, upon visual inspection of the monument, most iron elements of the Colossus appeared in quite good conservation condition despite the general degradation of the protective coating (Figure 2a) with scarce evidence of galvanic corrosion. In contrast, active corrosion of the iron elements was observed regardless of their direct contact with the copper sheets. In some cases, the same iron bars presented some portions in good conservation conditions and other nearby portions with active corrosion (Figure 2b,c).\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 19\ninvestigation of the long-term galvanic coupling between the wrought iron and copper.

The driving force for this corrosion process is represented by the difference in free corrosion potential between the two metals: The less noble metal acts as the anode and undergoes oxidation, while the nobler one is the cathode and is protected from corrosion [4\u20136]. A notorious case in which corrosion by galvanic coupling has been a conservation issue is the Statue of Liberty in the harbour of New York.

In this case, the microclimatic conditions to which the iro is exposed and the disposition and interconnection of the different iron elements resulted in corrosion at specific locations with highly expansive effects. This peculiar situation induced significant deformation of many elements of the bridge [21,22]. Besides the qualitative identification of the corrosion products, the quantification of their phases has also been reported in the literature as relevant for understanding the level of protectiveness provided by corrosion layers [15,18,23\u201325]. In particular, some authors suggested calculating a protective ability index (PAI) for the iron patinas based on the ratio between the number of stable phases and reactive ones [26]. The PAI was suggested by Yamashita et al. [26] for the first time. They quantified the amount of goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH), i.e., the stable phase, and of lepidocrocite (\u03b3-FeOOH), i.e., the reactive one. Thus, the PAI was defined as follows: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefe where \u03b1 indicates the mass fraction of \u03b1-FeOOH and \u03b3 the mass fraction of \u03b3-FeOOH. They demonstrated that the PAI is strongly correlated to the corrosion rate of the surface. When \u03b1/\u03b3 is higher than 1, the rust layer appears quite stable and protective [14].\nAccording to European standards and several studies, copper alloys have good resistance to corrosion in moderately aggressive environments [27,28]. In particular, the copper shows lower corrosion rates with respect to iron and carbon steel in the same environments [27]. Furthermore, copper alloys show different corrosion resistances with respect to pure metal thanks to the contribution of alloying elements [28\u201332]. Therefore, copper and copper alloys have been widely employed in the artistic and architectural fields, especially to produce artefacts and architectural elements for outdoor exposure\n[28,29,33,34].\nFigure 2.

Galvanic corrosion is a specific form of corrosion that occurs between two dissimilar metals that are in contact in the presence of a conductive electrolyte [4]. The driving force for this corrosion process is represented by the difference in free corrosion potential between the two metals: The less noble metal acts as the anode and undergoes oxidation, while the nobler one is the cathode and is protected from corrosion [4\u20136]. A notorious case in which corrosion by galvanic coupling has been a conservation issue is the Statue of Liberty in the harbour of New York. The statue was built with an internal structure of iron elements on which an external copper \u201cskin\u201d was joined, giving shape to the female figure of Liberty. In fact, the Statue of Liberty has been previously compared to the San Carlone since they present relevant similarities in terms of materials and manufacturing technologies [1]. Due to the higher nobility of copper with respect to iron, severe corrosion of the iron elements of the Statue of Liberty was observed [7]. In this case, galvanic corrosion has been favoured and accelerated by New York\u2019s humid and chlorine-rich environment. To understand the galvanic corrosion of iron and its behaviour in different contexts, it is important to know the level of protection provided by the corrosion layers that can form under different exposure conditions. Depending on a series of environmental factors (e.g., oxygen availability, pH, ion concentration of the electrolyte, etc.), several forms of oxides and iron compounds are produced during Fe oxidation, forming a layer commonly referred to as \u201cpatina\u201d. A detailed model for the description of the corrosion mechanism of iron was proposed by Evans and Taylor [8] and demonstrated by Stratmann and Streckel [9,10]. Iron corrosion products are often porous, poorly adherent, and often show cracks in most external layers. Therefore, they are not effective in hindering the access of water and oxygen to the metallic surface and in lowering the corrosion rate. In the initial stages of corrosion, a thin oxide/hydroxide film (typically 1\u20134 nm) is formed with a passivating effect in nonaggressive conditions [11]. During the intermediate stages of corrosion, the formation of two types of the so-called \u201cgreen rusts\u201d is observed, namely, \u201cgreen rust I\u201d FeII2FeIIIOx(OH)y and \u201cgreen rust II\u201d FeIIFeIIIOx(OH)y [11]. In the final stages of corrosion, the corrosion layers of surfaces exposed to atmospheric corrosion mainly consist of iron oxides and oxides\u2013hydroxides. These oxides are characterized by different levels of crystallinity: In particular, several polymorphs of FeOOH can be present [11\u201313]. In general, it was observed that lepidocrocite (\u03b3-FeOOH) is the main phase in the first weeks after the transformation of the green rust, while upon longer exposures the predominant phase becomes goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH), as it is the most stable iron oxide\u2013hydroxide. In association with goethite, magnetite (Fe3O4) can also be found. In fact, its development is promoted when the supply of oxygen is limited, and a slight variation in its availability can favour the stability of one or another of these two compounds [13]. In the case of high concentrations of chlorides in the atmosphere, high relative humidity and low pH, the formation of akaganeite (\u03b2-FeOOH) is promoted. In addition, the formation of akaganeite is typical in the proximity of coastal areas or in pits. In these cases, \u03b2-Fe2(OH)3Cl is the typical intermediate product that can be detected in association with green rusts [13]. Moreover, hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3) and maghemite (\u03b3-Fe2O3) can be detected among corrosion products. Even if they are seldom produced upon atmospheric corrosion, they have been identified in several cases of cultural heritage artefacts [13]. In fact, hematite occurs in high-temperature corrosion or as transformation products when other corrosion products are heated. Therefore, its presence on artistic or archaeological surfaces can be due to hightemperature treatments performed in the past [13,14]. Maghemite was, instead, identified in archaeological artefacts and on historical iron in the very first phases of atmospheric corrosion [14]. In addition, low crystallinity phases can be detected among the corrosion products, especially in the most internal layer of rust. These amorphous phases are usually constituted by feroxyhyte (\u03b4-FeOOH) and ferrihydrite (Fe3+)2O3\u00b70.5H2O [15\u201318].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2072 4 of 17\nThe composition of corrosion products can be influenced by the presence and concentration of atmospheric pollutants. When sulphur dioxide (SO2) is present, it can influence the corrosion rate of iron. When a significant concentration of SO2 is present in the environment, the formation of H2SO4 in the electrolyte film is promoted with a consequent decrease in its pH. Moreover, sulphuric acid can dissolve oxides to produce FeSO4. FeSO4 is soluble and hygroscopic, thus favouring the formation of an electrolyte film even with low RH values. Even if the iron patinas resulting from atmospheric corrosion are normally constituted by iron oxides and hydroxides, hydrated phases of FeSO4 have also been identified in atmospheric rusts on low alloy steels [19,20]. Moreover, chlorides can play an important role in the atmospheric corrosion of iron-based alloys. Chlorides can promote the formation of akaganeite instead of goethite in the final stages of corrosion. Additionally, chloride ions have a high transport number in water, thus moving easily in the electrolyte film. Thus, when the concentration of chloride ions is significant, an increase in the corrosion rate can be expected [11]. A critical aspect of the atmospheric corrosion of iron elements is connected with the high increase in volume that may be associated with the formation of corrosion products. A notable case of atmospheric corrosion is the one of Ponte di San Michele (St. Michael\u2019s bridge), located in Italy between Paderno d\u2019Adda and Calusco d\u2019Adda and built-in 1889. In this case, the microclimatic conditions to which the iron is exposed and the disposition and interconnection of the different iron elements resulted in corrosion at specific locations with highly expansive effects. This peculiar situation induced significant deformation of many elements of the bridge [21,22]. Besides the qualitative identification of the corrosion products, the quantification of their phases has also been reported in the literature as relevant for understanding the level of protectiveness provided by corrosion layers [15,18,23\u201325].

The PAI was suggested by Yamashita et al. [26] for the first time. They quantified the amount of goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH), i.e., the stable phase, and of lepidocrocite (\u03b3-FeOOH), i.e., the reactive one. Thus, the PAI was defined as follows:\nPAI = \u03b1\n\u03b3\nwhere \u03b1 indicates the mass fraction of \u03b1-FeOOH and \u03b3 the mass fraction of \u03b3-FeOOH. They demonstrated that the PAI is strongly correlated to the corrosion rate of the surface. When \u03b1/\u03b3 is higher than 1, the rust layer appears quite stable and protective [14]. According to European standards and several studies, copper alloys have good resistance to corrosion in moderately aggressive environments [27,28]. In particular, the copper shows lower corrosion rates with respect to iron and carbon steel in the same environments [27].

The following protocol was used: frequency range [100 kHz\u201310 mHz] with \u00b110 mV with respect to Ecorr. The polarization resistance value (Rp) was obtained from both LPR and EIS measurements. In particular, the Rp from EIS measurements were\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2072 7 of 17\ncalculated as the difference of the modulus |Z| at low and high frequencies [36,37].

Sample 46 is almost carbon-free (<0.1%), similar to reference sample A, while in Sample 44, the content of carbon is ~0.25 by weight.\nThe literature reports that a phosphorous (P) content between 0.1% and 0.6% could be associated with a higher resistance of wrought iron to corrosion [13,23,38,39]. However, the analysis of the samples of the San Carlone did not show a relevant presence of phosphorous. In contrast, for the reference sample of puddled iron, a phosphorus content of 0.3% was detected. The composition of Sample 87, the heavily corroded one, is not reported in Table 2, as its dimensions were too small to perform GDOES analysis. The elemental composition has been investigated by SEM-EDX on a polished cross-section, revealing only the presence of Fe, C, and O. In Figures 4 and 5, images of the microstructures observed in a cross-section of iron samples from the Colossus are reported (bulk in Figure 4, outermost zones in Figure 5). It has been observed that different areas of the samples presented slightly different carbon content and different microstructures, as could be expected for historical iron samples [13,40,41]. Moreover, the predominance of ferritic structure can be observed. In general, the core of the samples from the Colossus showed a ferritic microstructure with coarse grains ranging between about 10 and 100 \u00b5m (Figure 4a\u2013c). However, the microstructure of wrought iron samples was not homogeneous. Ferritic\u2013pearlitic microstructures were observed (Figure 5) in discontinuous areas near the surface or at the outer edge of the samples. Moreover, other microstructural heterogeneities were observed across the surface of the polished samples. In Samples 44 and 87 (Figure 5a,c), the ferrite grains showed a rounded shape, and their dimensions became smaller (up to 10 \u00b5m) on going from the bulk towards the surface. In Sample 46, the ferrite grains in ferritic\u2013pearlitic areas just below the surface showed a Widmanst\u00e4tten structure (Figure 5b) [42] with the exception of the most superficial area (about a couple of \u00b5m thick) where ferrite with small and round-shaped grains became predominant again. In hypoeutectoid steels such as those investigated here, Widmanst\u00e4tten structures may form mainly through rapid cooling combined with coarse prior austenitic grain size (leading to an insufficient number of nuclei for conventional proeutectoid ferrite crystallization) [42\u201344]. The abovedescribed microstructural heterogeneity in these samples can be ascribed to surface carburization/decarburization cycles during the hot forging process, typical of wrought iron produced in the reference period for this statue [40].

In general, for historical irons, the presence of a high number of inclusions with strongly variable dimensions is expected [13,40,45]. Inclusions are typically constituted by a glass matrix of fayalite (Fe2SiO4) with w\u00fcstite (FeO) crystals [13,39] and are usually arranged in parallel bands due to forging [39]. Both in samples of San Carlone and on the reference A sample (puddled iron), slag inclusions with dimensions ranging from about 50 \u00b5m to millimetric dimensions (Figure 6) were present. Moreover, in Sample A, smaller etching pits, typical of phosphorus-rich irons [39], could be observed (Figure 6d). In all the samples, small crystals (light areas) are visible in a glass matrix (darker areas in Figure 6) with the typical fayalite-w\u00fcstite structure confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy.

The results of these analyses are summarised in Table 3.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2072 11 of 17\nIn all the examined fragments, XRD analysis detected goethite and lepidocrocite as the main corrosion products. The former is typically considered among the protective corrosion products, and the latter is normally more reactive. Moreover, iron oxides have been identified in traces. In contrast, micro-Raman spectroscopy identified a larger number of corrosion products where goethite and lepidocrocite were again the main ones. Goethite and lepidocrocite were found especially in the intermediate layer between the most internal one and the external layer. The internal layer was compact and richer in iron oxides (magnetite, maghemite, and hematite), whereas the composition of the external one was influenced by the presence of environmental contaminants and pollutants. The latter observation could also explain the widespread presence of akaganeite, an iron oxide\u2013 hydroxide that usually contains 5\u20138 wt.% Cl. This data is in good accordance with the quite diffused presence of atacamite observed among the copper corrosion products. There might be three possible explanations for the presence of chlorides in Arona: They could have been transported by the wind to the Colossus; they could have been present in the past in the atmosphere as pollutants; or they could derive from the use of chloride-containing cleaning product during past restoration interventions. In addition, hematite has been detected in Sample 46. However, it should be considered that its presence could be partly due to a transformation of the corrosion products upon heating of the sample by the laser during Raman analysis. Moreover, a high fraction of amorphous phases has been highlighted by XRD analysis (Figure 9). For this reason, a quantification of the relative amount of each phase was impossible, as well as the evaluation of the protectiveness of corrosion layers based on the PAI index. Apparently, therefore, no significant differences can be observed in the chemical composition of the corrosion layers that could explain the different corrosion behaviour of the samples. The same analysis was also performed on powder samples of corrosion products collected from iron bars with evidence of active corrosion (not necessarily in direct contact with copper sheets, which provided similar results. Both XRD and micro-Raman analyses identified goethite and lepidocrocite as the main corrosion products in association with magnetite, maghemite, and hematite. On powder samples akaganeite was also detected. Moreover, for these samples, a lower variety of corrosion products were detected by XRD than by micro-Raman, basically identifying goethite, lepidocrocite, and a low amount of hematite on a few samples. Moreover, on powder samples, significant amounts of deposits and contaminants were detected. In particular, gypsum was typically identified in the areas with evident active corrosion. Gypsum normally reaches the surfaces by wet and dry deposition, thus explaining the high amounts of deposits on the surface. Furthermore, the presence of gypsum could suggest that the higher corrosion rate of those iron bars might be associated with specific microclimatic conditions promoted by deposition or condensation phenomena. In fact, the presence of more severe corrosion phenomena in association with\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2072 12 of 17\nhigh amounts of deposits and condensation was already observed during the preliminary inspections of the monument prior to the restoration of 1974\u20131975 [2].\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 19"

However, the description of Category 1 objects closely resembles the observation of most areas of iron elements in the San Carlone. As previously discussed, a clear correlation between alloy composition and conservation condition could not be identified. Data and observations suggest that good corrosion resistance may be mainly ascribed to the presence of slag inclusions and favourable environmental conditions.

            "text": "Both the bulk and the surface of the iron elements of the monumental statue of San Carlone of Arona showed quite good corrosion resistance. Galvanic corrosion is not expected to be relevant since their free corrosion potential was only 200 mV (or less) lower than that of the copper surfaces. The reason for the rather noble corrosion potential of iron elements is still unclear. The micro-Raman and XRD analyses of the corrosion products did not highlight any significant difference in the chemical composition of the corrosion products among different samples. Moreover, the investigation of the microstructure of the iron samples did not allow for an explanation as to why active corrosion was observed only in a few limited areas. The analysed sample was characterised by great heterogeneity of the iron-based material, consisting of three main microconstituents: ferrite, pearlite, and multiphase slag. The relatively noble corrosion potential and good corrosion behaviour of iron elements seem to be associated both with favourable environmental conditions (low chlorine content and low pollution) and possibly with the presence of slag inclusions with dimensions ranging from about 50 \u00b5m to ~1 mm. The obtained results allow us to hypothesise that the corrosion phenomena observed only in a few areas may be promoted by specific and localized microclimatic conditions, associated with deposits and condensation phenomena. This hypothesis could be supported by the significant presence in the corroded areas of gypsum, soil, and dust deposits, which may enhance corrosion due to their hygroscopicity. To corroborate the obtained results and better understand the good corrosion behaviour of the San Carlone iron alloys, it would be interesting to analyse other similar case studies with comparable environmental conditions and to perform further laboratory testing with different historical wrought irons.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.P., J.M.W. and S.G.; Methodology, C.P. and S.G.; Validation, C.P. and S.G.; Formal analysis, C.P., C.M., C.C., S.V., J.M.W. and S.G.; Investigation, C.P., C.M., C.C., S.V., J.M.W. and S.G.; Resources, J.M.W. and S.G.; Data curation, C.P. and S.G.; Writing\u2014original draft, C.P. and S.G.; Writing\u2014review and editing, C.P., C.M., C.C., S.V, J.M.W., P.G.G.L. and S.G.; Visualization, C.P., P.G.G.L., S.G., C.M. and C.C.; Supervision, J.M.W. and S.G.; Project administration, S.G.; Funding acquisition, J.M.W. and S.G.
