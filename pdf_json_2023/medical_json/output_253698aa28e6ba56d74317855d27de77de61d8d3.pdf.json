    "abstractText": "Brucellosis, mainly caused by Brucella, is a widespread zoonotic disease worldwide, with no available effective vaccine for human use. Recently, bioconjugate vaccines against Brucella have been prepared in Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 (YeO9), whose O-antigen structure is similar to that of Brucella abortus. However, the pathogenicity of YeO9 still hinders the largescale production of these bioconjugate vaccines. Here, an attractive system for the preparation of bioconjugate vaccines against Brucella was established in engineered E. coli. Briefly, the OPS gene cluster of YeO9 was modularized into five individual fragments and reassembled using synthetic biological methods through standardized interfaces, then introduced into E. coli. After confirming the synthesis of targeted antigenic polysaccharides, the exogenous protein glycosylation system (PglL system) was used to prepare the bioconjugate vaccines. A series of experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the bioconjugate vaccine could effectively evoke humoral immune responses and induce the production of specific antibodies against B. abortus A19 lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, the bioconjugate vaccines provide protective roles in both lethal and non-lethal challenge of B. abortus A19 strain. Using the engineered E. coli as a safer chassis to prepare bioconjugate vaccines against B. abortus paves the way for future industrial applications.",

Recently, bioconjugate vaccines against Brucella have been prepared in Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 (YeO9), whose O-antigen structure is similar to that of Brucella abortus. However, the pathogenicity of YeO9 still hinders the largescale production of these bioconjugate vaccines. Here, an attractive system for the preparation of bioconjugate vaccines against Brucella was established in engineered E. coli. Briefly, the OPS gene cluster of YeO9 was modularized into five individual fragments and reassembled using synthetic biological methods through standardized interfaces, then introduced into E. coli. After confirming the synthesis of targeted antigenic polysaccharides, the exogenous protein glycosylation system (PglL system) was used to prepare the bioconjugate vaccines. A series of experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the bioconjugate vaccine could effectively evoke humoral immune responses and induce the production of specific antibodies against B. abortus A19 lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, the bioconjugate vaccines provide protective roles in both lethal and non-lethal challenge of B. abortus A19 strain. Using the engineered E. coli as a safer chassis to prepare bioconjugate vaccines against B. abortus paves the way for future industrial applications.\nKEYWORDS\nconjugate vaccines, Brucella abortus, bioengineering, synthetic biology, PGCT\n1 Introduction\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by Brucella spp., which has a worldwide distribution. Epidemiological data demonstrate that approximately 500,000 people are infected with brucellosis annually (Mirnejad et al., 2017). Brucella spp., including B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis, is a family of dangerous zoonotic bacteria that can be transferred from an animal to a human host and remain pathogenic (de Figueiredo et al., 2015). Vaccination is the primary means of preventing and controlling its spread. Live attenuated vaccines, such as S19, RB51, 45/20, SR82, and Rev1, are the most common and are prepared for use in livestock (Masjedian Jezi et al., 2019). There are no licensed vaccines against B. abortus for human use to date. Notably, Biosafety level 3 containment and facilities"

Thus, it is difficult and costly for companies to develop and manufacture vaccines.\nLike most Gram-negative bacteria, Brucella species possess lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as the most important virulence factor, which is the dominant antigen in the immune response to brucellosis (von Bargen et al., 2012). Conjugate vaccines produced by covalently linking these bacterial surface polysaccharides to proteins have shown very good protection against infections, and some have been approved for marketing, such as PREVNAR\u00ae 13 produced by Pfizer (Berti and Adamo, 2018). The classic preparation methods of conjugate vaccines involve chemical cross-linking and require the extraction and purification of bacterial polysaccharides, carrier proteins, and final cross-linked products (Berti and Adamo, 2018; Mettu et al., 2020; Morais and Suarez, 2022), leading to the relatively high cost. In addition, the extraction of antigenic polysaccharides requires the fermentation of Brucella, posing biosafety risks.\nIn recent years, with the discovery and application of bacterial protein glycosylation systems, the preparation of conjugate vaccines by Protein Glycan Coupling Technology (PGCT) has attracted increasing attention from researchers in the field of vaccine design (Harding and Feldman, 2019). In this strategy, bacterial oligosaccharyltransferases (OTase) were utilized to catalyze the transfer of bacterial antigenic polysaccharides, such as O-specific polysaccharide chains of LPS (OPS), from lipid carriers to proteins (Nothaft and Szymanski, 2010), making the vaccine preparation process easier and safer. The first reported N-linked protein glycosyltransferase is PglB from Campylobacter jejuni, which can be expressed in E coli and catalyzes the glycosylation of its natural substrate, AcrA (Linton et al., 2005). An O-linked protein glycosyltransferase PglL from Neisseria meningitidis was used for the preparation of bioconjugate vaccines in our team (Pan et al., 2016). In recent years, another O-linked protein glycosyltransferase, PglS, has been developed for the application of bioconjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae (Harding et al., 2019).\nRegarding PGCT technology, ensuring the O antigen synthesis gene cluster of the target bacteria is functional in the exogenous host cell is crucial. At present, no reports demonstrate the successful expression of the O antigen synthesis gene cluster of Brucella in E coli. Fortunately, through serological analysis and NMR identification, a high degree of similarity has been found between the O antigen of B. abortus and that of YeO9, both of which use the same monosaccharide N-formyl-perosamine as the basic module (Bundle et al., 1989; Skurnik et al., 2007). For this reason, YeO9 have been used as an engineered host to prepare a glycosylated AcrA protein bearing the antigenic polysaccharides of B. abortus using an N-linked PGCT system. This protein can react with serum against B. abortus but lacks sufficient protective effects in challenge experiments (Iwashkiw et al., 2012). Inspired by this work, our team optimized the design of this vaccine and produced a bioconjugate vaccine for B. abortus with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) as the carrier protein using an O-linked PGCT system in YeO9. Animal experiments showed that the vaccine provided promising levels of protection (Huang et al., 2020). However, as YeO9 is an opportunistic pathogen, the risk for zoonotic disease remains (Galindo et al., 2011; Le Guern et al., 2016; Rivas et al., 2021).\nUsing engineered E. coli as chassis cells to prepare bioconjugate vaccines is a feasible pathway to solve the biosafety issues involved in the development of effective vaccines against highly pathogenic organisms (Dow et al., 2020). Given that the activity of the O antigen synthesis gene cluster remains unclear in B. abortus, the YeO9 antigen synthesis gene cluster was also used to produce conjugate vaccine in engineered E coli with the help of our O-linked PGCT system (PglL system). Fortunately, the desired glycoproteins with pentamer CTB as the carrier protein were successfully produced by E. coli, and a series of experiments demonstrated that this bioconjugate vaccine is safe and effective; the vaccine could protect mice in challenge experiments with different doses of B. abortus A19."

            "text": "plasmid and its functional verification in E coli\nYeO9 OPS was first synthesized in E. coli by constructing an appropriate plasmid. Considering that the gene cluster of YeO9 OPS is approximately 15,000 bp in length and comprises 12 genes (manC-wbcW) (Supplementary Figure S1), we planned to connect it to a plasmid backbone using the Golden Gate cloning method. Briefly, the OPS gene cluster was divided into five fragments, and these fragments and the pACYC184tac vector were linearized by PCR. All the fragments were designed with unique overhangs at each end. Then, the fragments were ligated to the vector skeleton using the Golden Gate Assembly Kit (BsaIHFv2) through one-step method and the new plasmid was named pACYC184tac-OPSBa (Figure 1A).\nTo verify the synthesis of YeO9 OPS in E. coli, we first transferred pACYC184tac-OPSBa into E. coli W3110, which cannot independently synthesize O-polysaccharide. After culturing in LB medium at 37\u00b0C overnight, the cells were successively incubated with YeO9 antibody and fluorescentlabeled secondary antibody. Through fluorescence imaging, we found that the Anti-YeO9 signal was obviously present in E. coli W3110 containing pACYC184tac-OPSBa, while no visible signal was found in the untreated W3110 strain (Figure 1B). Then, LPS was extracted, and the immunoblotting assay results also showed that the synthesized OPS could react with YeO9 antibody (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we used Brucella serum to verify its cross-reactivity. As expected, the fluorescence imaging results showed that the heterologously synthesized OPS cross-reacted with Brucella serum (Figure 1D). Similarly, immunoblotting results were consistent with the fluorescence imaging results (Figure 1E).\n3.2 Biosynthesis of B. abortus conjugate vaccine in engineered E. coli\nAfter confirming the successful synthesis of the heterologous OPS in E. coli W3110 and determining its specificity, we further\ntransformed pACYC184tac-OPSBa into our previously constructed strain W3110\u0394waal\u0394wbbH-L, which can block the transformation of OPS to lipid A and is more suitable for exogenous polysaccharide synthesis. The plasmid pET28a-pgIL-CTB4573 co-expressing glycosyltransferase PglL and CTB with glycosylation sequence 4,573 was also transformed into W3110\u0394waal\u0394wbbH-L to couple the carrier protein with the OPS. After inducing with IPTG, the whole bacterial sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting with a 6 \u00d7 His tag antibody was performed to detect the glycosylation of carrier proteins. The result showed a typical glycosylation ladder band when the polysaccharide gene cluster was co-expressed with the pglL and CTB, while only the carrier protein band was detected when the polysaccharide gene cluster was not co-expressed. This result suggests that OPS can be successfully coupled with CTB to generate glycoprotein (CTB-OPSBa) via the catalysis of glycosyltransferase PglL (Figure 2A). Then, the heterologously synthesized glycoprotein was purified via affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, and a series of verifications were performed. Coomassie blue staining and periodic acid Schiff staining showed consistent bands compared to the previous wholecell immunoblot. In addition, the glycoprotein was detected by Western blotting using an anti-6 \u00d7 His-Tag antibody, an antiYeO9, and Brucella serum sequentially, showing that the CTBOPSBa could react with both YeO9 antibody and Brucella serum (Figure 2B).\nCTB is known to form a pentamer in natural conditions and is often used as an immune activator because of its ability to bind with GM1, which is widely present on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (Beddoe et al., 2010). Moreover, the formation of a pentamer is a necessary condition for GM1 binding. Thus, we analyzed the particle size of CTB-OPSBa by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the results showed that the CTB-OPSBa was approximately 13 nm in diameter (Figure 2D). A native PAGE was also performed, and the Coomassie blue staining results showed that the molecular weight of the CTB-OPSBa glycoprotein was approximately 224\u2013250 kDa, which is approximately 5-fold that of the monomeric protein molecular weight (Figure 2C), indicating that glycosylation doesn\u2019t affect CTB polymerization. Further, we determined the binding capability of CTB-OPSBa with GM1 by ELISA method using the CTB standard and PBS as control. The results showed that the OD450 values decreased as the dilution of the CTB-OPSBa and CTB standard increased (Figure 2E), indicating that CTB retained the ability to bind to receptors after glycosylation. Moreover, to evaluate the stability of the glycoproteins, we examined the size and molecular weight of CTB-OPSBa at different time points at room temperature. The results showed no significant size change or obvious degradation even after 7 days (Figure 2F; Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting that the purified CTB-OPSBa was stable and could be stored at room temperature for a long time."

Serum cytokine levels were measured through the LiquiChip method, and the results showed increased concentrations of many Th1- and Th2-related cytokines (Figure 3A). We further examined CD4+ T cells in the spleens by flow cytometry at 3, 7, and 10 days after immunization, and the results showed that the spleens in CTB-OPSBa-treated mice had the highest percentage of CD4 + T cells at all three time points (Figure 3B). This result was also confirmed by the mouse spleen cell surface fluorescent antibody assay, which showed more CD3+ and CD4+ cells in the spleen sections (Figure 3C; Supplementary Figure S4).\nThe germinal center is the main site of the thymusdependent antigen response and is formed approximately 1 week after antigen stimulation. The main function of follicular T cells (Tfh cells) is to help B cells differentiate into effector cells in the germinal center. To verify the effect of CTB-OPSBa on Tfh cells and germinal center B cells, we first examined the changes in Tfh cells in the spleen of mice on days 3, 7, and 10. The flow cytometric results showed that CTBOPSBa increased the proportion of these cells in mouse spleens and that the cell proportion increased as the days of antigen stimulation increased (Figure 3D). The changes in germinal center B cells were consistent with those in Tfh cells, and CTBOPSBa could increase the percentage of germinal center B cells\n(Figure 3E). Additionally, the Ki67/B220 fluorescence results on day 10 showed significant splenic B-cell proliferation in the CTB-OPSBa group, while no B-cell proliferation was found in the PBS and OPS groups (Figure 3F; Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting that CTB-OPSBa stimulated the proliferation of mouse spleen germinal center B cells, leading to the activation of more B cells. The above results indicate that CTB-OPSBa can effectively stimulate the proliferation of mouse spleen lymphocytes and the humoral immune response."

First, on day 14, after three immunizations, we intraperitoneally injected each group of mice with 2.81 \u00d7 107 CFU B abortus A19 per mouse to detect the changes in cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12) after infection. The three inflammatory evidence factors in CTB-OPSBa-immunized mice remained at low levels at all observed time points (p < 0.001), while the other groups showed a significant increase after infection, especially in TNF-\u03b1, which reached 250 pg/mL in the PBS and CTB groups (Figure 6B).\nBrucella infestation mainly colonizes the spleen and the liver, causing a series of associated pathologies. Thus, we collected the spleens ofmice on\nday 7 after infection for weighing, bacterial load assays, and HE staining. These results showed that all mice infected with B. abortus A19 had altered spleen indicators compared to the control group. Among them, the CTB-OPSBa group showed the smallest change in spleen weight (Figure 6C; Supplementary Figure S6). Similarly, the CTB-OPSBa group had the lowest spleen bacterial load of approximately 103\u2013103.3, whichwas statistically significant compared to that of the other groups (Figure 6D). HE staining of the spleens of CTB-OPSBa immunized mice revealed that these spleens demonstrated a more pronounced red-white bone marrow border, fewer multinucleated giant cells, and a better-maintained lymphocyte ratio than the spleens from mice in the other groups (Figure 6E). We also performed HE staining of the liver; as expected, the pathological changes in the liver were consistent with those in the spleen (Figure 6F).\nFinally, after three immunizations, we injected B. abortus A19 (2.1 \u00d7 108 CFU/mouse (4 \u00d7 LD50) (Huang et al., 2020)) intraperitoneally into mice to assess the protective effect of CTBOPSBa on mice infected with lethal doses.

The results showed that all mice in the PBS and CTB groups died on the third day after infection. The survival rate of mice in the OPSBa group was approximately 10%, while the survival rate of mice in the CTB-OPSBa group was 100% (Figure 6G). Mice in the CTBOPSBa group showed a decreasing trend in body weight during the first 3 days after infection (approximately 3 g) and gradually recovered on the sixth day (Figure 6H).

The advantage of this strategy is that there is no need to clone large fragments of the gene cluster to synthesize antigenic polysaccharides. However, the cultivation conditions of attenuated strains should be optimized in the process of large-scale preparation, and some strains might pose certain biosafety risks. Another method, as used in this study, is to produce conjugate vaccines using engineered E. coli. Many reports have shown that E coli can be used to produce bioconjugate vaccines against pathogens such as Shigella dysenteriae, Francisella tularensis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, E. coli O157:H7, S. pneumoniae (Kay et al., 2016), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Dow et al., 2020). The key technical step of this method is obtaining the O antigen synthesis gene cluster, commonly as large DNA fragments that are difficult to clone accurately due to the spontaneous mutations that occur during PCR. The rapid development of synthetic biology techniques has led to the development of novel DNA assembly technologies. For example, the Golden Gate cloning technology used in this study has been successfully applied to rapidly assemble multigene constructs (Engler and Marillonnet, 2014). Recently, new flexible gene cluster cloning workflows were proposed based on precise DNA cleavage tools (CRISPR system, especially near-PAMless SpCas9 variant SpRY) that can digest the target genome at specific sites even if there are no binding motifs of canonical restriction enzymes adjacent to bases of interest (Christie et al., 2022).\nThe antigenic polysaccharide synthesis gene clusters of target pathogens introduced into E coli host cells remained unchanged with their upstream sequences in most studies on developing bioconjugate vaccines using PGCT. This approach ensures the function of the exogenous genes but cannot regulate the synthesis of polysaccharide antigens. Another improvement in this study is replacing the original promoter with an inducible element, taking the first step forward in precisely controlling exogenous polysaccharides. With the increase in multi-omics data tools, especially quantitative transcriptomics (Ouyang et al., 2020), gene transcriptional regulatory elements, such as promotors and terminators, can be rationally designed and optimized for the target gene cluster. For example, various promoters with different activities (constitutive promoters or synthetic promoters) could be used to adjust the speed of polysaccharide antigen synthesis and coordinate with carrier protein and glycosyltransferase expression, thereby reducing the growth burden of the host cells and increasing the yield.\nMost reports using PGCT are focused on carrier proteins used in licensed chemical conjugate vaccines. A different carrier protein rCTB was chosen in this study due to its ability to bind GM1, which is present on the surface of most cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, to promote the antigen delivery process. The ability to form the correct pentamer (approximately 8 nm) is a prerequisite for CTB binding to GM1. We confirmed that protein glycosylation doesn\u2019t alter the spatial structure of rCTB. Another advantage of multimeric protein carriers over monomeric carriers is that the antigenic polysaccharide can be intensively displayed and is, thus, easily recognized by antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, the characteristics and nanometer sizes of carrier proteins should be emphasized in the design of bioconjugate vaccines.\nHost cell engineering is another crucial issue for PGCT technology. To avoid interference caused by endogenous LPS\nsynthesis competing with recombinant glycans, K12-derived E. coli (deficient in O antigen synthesis due to mutation) is usually used as the host strain. Further modifications have been made to the basic strains to enhance the efficiency of protein glycosylation. The deletion of waaL (encoding the O-antigen ligase WaaL) (Feldman et al., 2005) and wecA (catalyzing initial transfer of N-acetylglucosamine on to the lipid carrier UndP) (Garcia-Quintanilla et al., 2014; Musumeci et al., 2014; Kay et al., 2022) is a widely accepted strategy. The double-mutant strains have been demonstrated to be suitable for the preparation of the bioconjugate vaccines against F. tularensis and B. pseudomallei. However, knocking out wecA isn\u2019t suitable for the synthesis of all exogenous polysaccharides (Lehrer et al., 2007), such as the YeO9 OPS used in this experiment. The synthesis of OPS in YeO9 relies on an ABC transporterdependent pathway, in which the GlcNAc initiating transferase WecA is required to add the primer monosaccharide to facilitate the following assembly of the adapter and repeat unit domain (Greenfield and Whitfield, 2012). Therefore, another host strain described recently (Peng et al., 2021) with the double deletions of waaL and wbbH-L gene clusters was used in this study, which might be a more suitable engineered strain for bioconjugate vaccine against B. abortus.\nMacrophages are the main target cells for Brucella invasion and induce pro-inflammatory responses and the secretion of inflammatory factors (Baldi and Giambartolomei, 2013), such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 (Murphy et al., 2001). After infection with B. abortus, the level of TNF-\u03b1 will continue to increase, leading to the production of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 (Dorneles et al., 2015). In this study, the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 in the serum of mice immunized with CTB-OPSBa remained lower compared to those in the control group, suggesting that vaccinated mice have pre-existing protective antibodies with good bactericidal activity. Two models of Brucella infection with different doses were generated to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of the protective effects of our bioconjugate vaccines. The sublethal challenge simulates the main characteristics of Brucella infection by causing spleen and liver tissue damage, such as mild lymphocyte depletion and macrophage infiltration in splenic nodules and liver granuloma production (Grillo et al., 2012). The lethal challenge is a common model for studying sepsis-causing bacteria and has been used in vaccine research to assess protection against various pathogens. The combination of two infection models can clearly provide more intuitive results for testing vaccine efficacy. It is satisfactory that both of these experiments showed that the bioconjugate vaccines produced here by engineered E. coli could effectively protect mice against bacterial infections, suggesting the potential for clinical application.\nOur study provides a better strategy to address the safety issues in preparing classic B. abortus vaccines. Using engineered E. coli as a chassis to produce the bioconjugate vaccine against B. abortus by PGCT technology significantly reduces the risk of infection and allows for large-scale production. In the future, we will continue to optimize Brucella vaccine production via engineered E. coli. For example, protein antigens expressed by E coli host cells can be mixed with the polysaccharide antigens developed in this study, which will provide better protection due to improved cellular immunity.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org11"
