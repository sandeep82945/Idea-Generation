In this study, we demonstrate that synthetic analogues of the GFP chromophore can be used to investigate ligand-induced conformational changes in proteins. We synthesized thiol-reactive derivatives of four analogues of the GFP chromophore that exhibit notable solvatochromism. We used these derivatives to label two proteins: the soluble calcium sensor recoverin (Rec) and the transmembrane G protein-coupled A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR), via cysteines located or introduced in the regions that undergo structural changes upon ligand binding. Two of these dyes showed Ca2+-induced fluorescence changes when attached to Rec. Notably, our best-performing dye, DyeC, when attached to A2AAR, revealed agonist-induced changes in both fluorescence intensity and shape of the emission spectrum. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided mechanistic insights into these changes showing the activation of A2AAR transfers DyeC to a more confined and more hydrophilic environment. Additionally, an allosteric modulator, HMA, induces changes in DyeC fluorescence spectra, indicating a distinct receptor conformation from apo, antagonist, or agonist-bound receptors. Our study demonstrates that GFP-inspired dyes are effective for detecting structural changes in GPCR (G protein-coupled receptors), with advantages such as the ability to perform both intensity-based and ratiometric tracking, red-shifted fluorescence spectra, high extinction coefficient, and sensitivity to allosteric modulation. These dyes expand the toolbox for tracking ligand-induced changes and facilitate new insights into conformational changes induced by allosteric modulators in GPCRs.\n3"

            "text": "From in vivo imaging to single-molecule tracking, the green fluorescent protein (GFP)\nhas become an indispensable tool for many biological studies [1]. The GFP chromophore, 4- hydroxybenzylidene-dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI, Figure 1), is spontaneously formed due to specific cyclization of three amino acid residues located in the center of the GFP \u03b2-barrel. Structurally modified synthetic analogues of the GFP chromophore represent a diverse class of benzylidene imidazolones (BDI) that found many applications as versatile labels due to their exceptional fluorescent properties, small size, and easy synthesis [2]. Similar to GFP, where the high fluorescence yield of HBDI is supported by the protein microenvironment, the transition of some BDI derivatives from water to less polar solvents results in a substantial increase in their fluorescence quantum yield (FQY). Such compounds have been extensively tested as fluorogenic environmentally sensitive dyes [3\u20135].\nEnvironmentally sensitive labels have often been used to study ligand-induced\nstructural changes in proteins [6\u201312]. Typically, in this approach, their thiol-reactive variants are attached to cysteine residues (either intentionally introduced or naturally present) located in the vicinity of functionally labile protein elements. In successful constructs, fluorescence properties of the label have the ability to report on protein activation or inhibition. These studies shed light on the molecular mechanisms of protein activation and in some cases facilitated the creation of biomolecular sensors for a wide variety of metabolites [8,13\u201318]. Despite the wide range of applications, GFP-inspired labels have never been used for this purpose before. In this study, we show these labels can serve as environmentally sensitive labels to report on conformational changes in GPCRs.\nGPCRs constitute the largest class of membrane proteins in humans that regulate\ncritical physiological processes, e.g. vision, taste, neurotransmission, and inflammation. More than one third of drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have GPCRs as their primary targets [19]. Most of these drugs target the primary extracellular binding site that naturally accommodates endogenous ligands, i.e. the orthosteric ligandbinding pocket. The ligand binding causes structural changes propagating across the receptor towards the intracellular side and enables coupling to its cognate G-proteins or other intracellular partners. In the absence of ligands, most GPCRs exhibit a certain level of activity known as basal signaling. Orthosteric ligands can directly control GPCR activity: agonists increase the basal signaling, antagonists occupy the ligand-binding site but do not affect the\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The affinity and efficacy of orthosteric ligands can be affected by allosteric modulators that bind to spatially distinct sites on GPCRs and modulate their function [21\u201324]. Notably, some allosteric modulators can affect receptor\u2019s activation on their own [23\u201327].\nThe A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR), one of the most studied GPCRs, is a promising\ntarget for drugs against cancer, chronic pain, sleep disorders, depression, and Parkinson\u2019s disease [28]. It regulates cardiovascular system and inflammation throughout the body and modulates the neurotransmission of glutamate and dopamine in the brain [29,30]. A2AAR has often been used as a prototypical receptor for the development of biophysical techniques for studying other GPCRs [31\u201335].\nHere we assessed four GFP-inspired fluorophores for their potential to serve as\nenvironmentally sensitive labels to report on conformational changes in proteins. For this, we attached a maleimide group to them for cysteine labeling and studied their spectral properties in solvents with varying polarity and viscosity. The best of them were then employed to label two proteins: bovine recoverin (Rec) and A2AAR. We used Rec as a convenient model protein to evaluate the performance of environmentally sensitive labels. This is attributed to the presence of a sole cysteine residue and the considerable conformational alterations experienced upon activation by Ca2+. Using the best performing dye attached to A2AAR, we investigated effects of various ligands, including antagonists, agonists, and an allosteric modulator, on its fluorescence and observed reliable and distinctive changes. Finally, we conducted molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the A2AAR complexes with the dyes to obtain structural insights into the observed changes."

Therefore, we selected two 4-nitrile (Figure 1, DyeA and DyeB) and two 2,5-dime-thoxy (Figure 1, DyeC and DyeD) benzyli-dene derivatives of red-shifted BDI compounds and complemented them with a maleimide group to enable covalent binding to cysteine residues.\nTo assess the solvatochromism of the maleimide-conjugated compounds, we\ninvestigated their fluorescence properties in solvents with different polarities ranging from water to pentadecane (Figure 1, Supplementary Table S1). Similarly to the original compounds, all four dyes showed notable changes in their fluorescence emission spectra depending on the solvent. We observed that FQYs of the 4-nitrile benzyli-dene compounds (DyeA and DyeB) strongly depend on the solvent polarity, while the wavelengths of their emission maxima vary by <10 nm in different solvents. At the same time, the 2,5-dime-thoxy benzyli-dene compounds (DyeC and DyeD) showed solvent-dependent changes both in FQY and the wavelength of their emission maxima.\nFluorescence of GFP-inspired dyes highlights Ca2+-dependent conformational\nchanges in Rec\nTo select dyes suitable for tracking ligand-induced structural changes in proteins, we\nused a water soluble protein Rec. Rec is a 23 kDa member of the neuronal calcium sensor family [38], which participates in regulation of phototransduction and light adaptation of retinal photoreceptors [39]. Rec has two calcium binding sites, and the interaction with calcium ions results in substantial changes in its structure [40]. Rec contains a single cysteine residue, which is conveniently located in the protein loop subjected to structural changes upon activation [41]. The emission spectrum of the Alexa647 label bound to this cysteine was shown to undergo substantial changes depending on the calcium concentration [8]. All these results and considerations make Rec a perfect test object to validate whether our modified BDI fluorescent labels can report structural changes in a protein.\nWe labeled Rec with each of the four synthesized maleimide dyes. The absorption\nspectra of labeled Rec (Supplementary Figure S1) showed high labeling efficiencies for DyeA, DyeB, and DyeC (~90\u2013100%), while DyeD had a low labeling efficiency (<5%) and, therefore, was excluded from further experiments. The low labeling efficiency is probably related to the low water solubility of DyeD that was originally observed for its parent compound (5d in [3]).\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Rec-DyeB and Rec-DyeC displayed pronounced Ca2+-induced changes in their fluorescence spectra. Similarly to previously characterized solvatochromic properties of DyeB, Rec-DyeB showed a higher emission intensity in the presence of calcium; however, its emission maximum also red-shifted by >50 nm, while the emission wavelength of free DyeB did not exhibit a solvatochromic behavior. On the other hand, Rec-DyeC showed a 50 nm redshift of the emission maximum as expected from the solvatochromic behavior of the free dye, but without any changes in the fluorescence intensity. We further tested the labeling specificity for our best-performing dye, DyeC, and observed that the efficiency of non-specific labeling of the cysteine-free Rec mutant RecC39D was negligible (<5%, Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting that C39 was the only labeled amino acid in the WT protein.\nFluorescence of DyeC highlights conformational changes in A2AAR induced by agonists\nand an allosteric modulator\nTo track ligand-induced conformational changes in a GPCR, we labeled A2AAR with\nDyeB and DyeC. For this purpose, we applied a single-point mutation L2256.27C (superscripts indicate Ballesteros\u2013Weinstein numbering [42]) to introduce a cysteine residue at the intracellular tip of the transmembrane helix TM6. A large-scale movement of the intracellular part of TM6 is one of the hallmarks of activation in class A GPCRs, including A2AAR [43]. Similar label placements at the intracellular tip of TM6 were used in previous fluorescencebased [44,45] and F19-NMR [32,46,47] studies.\nThe wild-type A2AAR (A2AARWT) has 6 native unpaired cysteines buried in the receptor\ncore. To attach dyes only to the introduced cysteine, we labeled A2AARL225C in crude membranes as described previously [45,48]. After labeling, A2AARL225C was purified and reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs (ND). The labeling efficiency was estimated as 80% for A2AARL225C-DyeC and <5% for A2AARL225C-DyeB (Supplementary Figure S2), therefore, DyeB was excluded from further experiments. As a negative control for labeling specificity, we also tried labeling A2AARWT with DyeC. The A2AARWT-DyeC sample showed a very low but detectable fluorescence signal indicating a small percentage of non-specific labeling (<10%, Supplementary Figure S2). However, the fluorescence emission spectrum of A2AARWT-DyeC did not change upon the addition of A2AAR ligands (Supplementary Figure S3), and, therefore, we concluded that the non-specifically labeled A2AAR did not contribute to the observed spectral changes described below.\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is\nThe copyright holder for this preprintthis version posted June 4, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.01.543196doi: bioRxiv preprint\n7\nTo test the response of DyeC to A2AAR activation, we measured its fluorescence\nemission spectra (Figure 3B) in the apo state, as well as in complex with two agonists (NECA and adenosine) and two antagonists (ZM241385 and SCH58261). The A2AAR-DyeC emission spectra showed a similar response to both agonists, while the antagonists did not change the emission spectra compared to the apo state. The agonists increased the integrated fluorescence intensity by ~20%, which we quantified as the integrated fluorescence intensity of the emission spectrum (Figure 3C). Furthermore, the agonists induced a red shift of ~5 nm in the emission maximum and resulted in a steeper left shoulder in the spectrum. To quantify this change, we used the ratio between the intensities of the main emission peak at 520 nm and the blue-shifted shoulder peak at 460 nm (I520/I460). The ratio I520/I460 changed from ~1.7 for the apo and antagonist-bound receptor to ~2.0 for agonist-bound receptor (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, DyeC allowed tracking of the conformation changes in A2AAR based on changes in both the fluorescence intensity and the shape of the spectrum.\nTo test whether ligand-induced changes in A2AARL225C-DyeC fluorescence spectra\nwere due to conformational changes of the receptor and not due to direct interaction between DyeC and ligands, we conducted displacement experiments of agonist NECA with the excess of antagonist ZM241385, and vi\u0441e versa (Supplementary Figure S4). NECA and ZM241385 are both highly specific orthosteric A2AAR ligands (with nanomolar Kd\u2019s [https://www.guidetopharmacology.org]). The fact that the effect of NECA can be fully reversed by an excess of ZM241385, and vice versa, indicates that both ligands can displace each other from the orthosteric site and have no direct interactions with DyeC.\nAfter establishing the response to orthosteric agonists and antagonists, we used\nA2AARL225C-DyeC to characterize structural changes in A2AAR induced by one of the most potent allosteric ligands, 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA, Figure 3B). Previous docking simulations suggested that HMA binds to a conserved intramembrane sodium-binding site that is spatially distinct from the orthosteric binding site in A2AAR, where all other ligands used in this study bind [49]. Previous functional studies showed that HMA increases the dissociation rate (koff) for A2AAR antagonists, but not agonists [50,51]. At the same time, HMA was shown to displace both antagonists and agonists in competition assays [49,50,52]. In our experiments, the shape of the fluorescence emission spectrum for the A2AARL225C-DyeC complex with HMA differed significantly from those for the receptor bound to other orthosteric ligands used in this study. The emission spectrum in the presence of HMA showed a higher relative intensity of the blue-shifted shoulder peak at 460 nm than the spectra recorded in the presence of either agonists or antagonists. The integrated fluorescence intensity measured in\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

These results imply that the allosteric ligand HMA stabilizes a distinct conformation of A2AAR, which is different from the conformations of both inactive apo or antagonist-bound A2AAR and active agonist-bound A2AAR. Thus, the employment of the A2AARL225C-DyeC fluorescent sensor can report on conformational changes induced by A2AAR ligands with different modes of action."

Since obtaining adequate structural ensembles of labeled conformers in unbiased MD simulations still represents a serious computational challenge [53], which is additionally complicated by the presence of a lipid bilayer, we employed an efficient enhanced sampling technique, known as metadynamics [54,55]. This approach allowed us to estimate free energy surfaces of DyeC attached to A2AARL225C and predict its preferred spatial positions in the active and inactive state of the receptor.\nThe estimated free energy surfaces revealed a remarkable difference in the predominant\norientation of DyeC between the active and inactive conformations of A2AAR (Figure 4A-B). In the active state, regions with low free energy values were observed near the protein-lipid interface, where DyeC appears plunged into lipid headgroups. In contrast, the low free energy regions in the inactive state were located at the receptor surface, where the label is located in the vicinity of intracellular tips of protein helices remaining largely in the aqueous environment.\nWe further conducted unbiased molecular simulations without applying any external\nforces to evaluate the mobility of the DyeC label in the uncovered free energy minima for both active and inactive states. The autocorrelation function (ACF) calculated for the vector describing the orientation of the label unveiled its significantly slower dynamics in the active state, in which DyeC was immersed in the lipid headgroup region or trapped between TM5 and TM6 helices of A2AAR, compared to the inactive state featuring the solvent-exposed DyeC conformation (see Figure 4C,D, and F).\nThese MD results allowed us to propose a mechanistic explanation for the changes in\nthe spectral properties observed upon A2AAR activation. In the active state of the receptor, DyeC moves from an aqueous environment to the head group region of the lipid bilayer.

The latter may be the reason for the red shift of the fluorescence emission maximum, which is consistent with the observed dependence of the DyeC emission maximum on the solvent logP (see Supplementary Table 1 and Figure 4G, compared with the consensus logP prediction = \u22122.65 obtained using the SwissADME service [59] for the zwitterionic phosphocholine molecule mimicking the POPC head group). In turn, in the active state, DyeC is more confined due to its encapsulation into the G-protein-binding cavity or interaction with TM6 (see Figure 4E). This is reflected in lower ACF and invokes a restriction of the intramolecular rotation (RIR) of DyeC that is known to be responsible for FQY enhancements in GFP-derived chromophores [60]. A concomitant fluorescence enhancement may be induced by the higher viscosity of the surrounding lipid environment (up to 5 orders of magnitude [56\u201358]) compared to the bulk water."

Two out of four dyes (DyeB and DyeC) exhibited Ca2+-dependent changes in their emission spectra when attached to the native C39 of Rec. Considering the structural similarity between Rec and other neuronal calcium sensors, DyeB and DyeC can be implemented for monitoring conformational changes of these proteins, including those involved in cardiac arrhythmia, Alzeheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s diseases, and proliferation of cancer cells [61]. DyeC showed the most significant spectral change and was selected for A2AAR labeling. We specifically attached DyeC to the intracellular tip of TM6 of A2AAR containing a single point mutation (L2256.27C) using a crude membrane labeling procedure. We embedded the labeled A2AAR into ND to mimic a membrane-like environment. These measures improved the structural integrity of the receptor and minimized potential artifacts. Overall, our approach compared favorably with previously reported methods involving environmentally sensitive dyes (Supplementary table S3), where receptors were extensively mutated (up to six point mutations) or/and solubilized in detergents.\nA2AARL225C-DyeC exhibited a 20% increase in the integrated fluorescence intensity and\na 5-nm red-shift in the fluorescence emission maximum in response to the interaction with full agonists (NECA and Adenosine) but showed no response to the interaction with antagonists (ZM241385 and SCH58261). Both the integrated fluorescence intensity and the I520/I460 ratio can be effectively used for quantitative description of the observed spectral changes.

It can be also useful when analyzing the effects of allosteric ligands, such as HMA, which has a unique impact on the shape of the DyeC fluorescence spectra and can be distinguished from that caused by agonists. These spectral effects can be distinguished through ratiometric analysis but not by integrated fluorescence intensity. The distinctive shape of the emission spectrum implies that structural changes in A2AAR induced by HMA differ from those caused by orthosteric agonists. This finding aligns with a previous NMR study [32], which showed that HMA increases the population of a state distinct from those stabilized by NECA.\nIn terms of the magnitude of agonist-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity and\nthe emission maximum wavelength, DyeC is competitive to other environmentally sensitive labels that have been previously employed to monitor GPCR activation (Supplementary Table S2). Most of the previous GPCR activation studies using fluorescent labels have been focused on the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) that exhibits agonist-induced structural changes similar to A2AAR [62]. Dyes of various chemical natures were employed to label \ud835\udefd2AR at positions homologous or close to the labeling position at the intracellular tip of TM6 used in our study. Among these dyes, bimane was the most common label that showed a 50% intensity change and a 15-nm spectral shift in the presence of agonists [63], which exceeded the fluorescence changes observed for DyeC in our experiments (20% intensity change and 5-nm spectral shift). However, bimane has an absorption spectrum with the maximum at a shorter wavelength (~450 nm compared to 515 nm for DyeC) and a lower extinction coefficient (~5,000 M-1cm-1 [64], compared to 14,000 M-1cm-1 for DyeC). Thus, despite the superior response characteristics of bimane, the red-shifted spectrum and the higher extinction coefficient of DyeC make it a more favorable dye for GPCR labeling in some applications.\nOur MD simulations revealed that the observed changes in the DyeC fluorescence\nspectrum can be explained by the relocation of the fluorescent label to a more confined conformational space with a more hydrophilic environment upon receptor activation. This effect is caused by the agonist-induced outward movement of the DyeC-labeled intracellular tip of TM6, representing a common feature of the activation mechanism in class A GPCRs [65]. Considering these observations, we propose that our approach could be applied to other GPCRs enabling future research on their conformational dynamics.\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The emission spectrum of the third sample was measured after 20 min incubation at 4 \u00baC. In the second experiment, the same steps were repeated, but the order of adding ZM241385 and NECA was opposite. The final protein concentration was 2 \u00b5M in each measured sample.\nMolecular dynamics simulations\nProtein models were prepared using the structure of a thermostabilized A2AAR in\ncomplex with ZM241385 (PDB ID: 3PWH, [70]) and the structure of A2AAR in complex with mini-Gs (PDB ID: 5G53, [71]) for inactive and active states, respectively. The thermostabilized mutations were mutated back to the native amino acids and the missing regions were added using MODELLER [72]. All ionizable amino acids were modeled in their standard ionization state at pH=7.\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Both active and inactive protein models were embedded in a lipid bilayer consisting of POPC and solvated using the CHARMM-GUI server [73]. The final models contained 203 POPC lipids, 21,674 water molecules, 86/95 Na+/Cl\u2013 ions in the active state (97,334 atoms in total, box dimensions 9.09 \u00d7 9.09 \u00d7 11.48 nm), and 205 POPC lipids, 25,406 water molecules, 98/107 Na+/Cl\u2013 ions in the inactive state (108,682 atoms in total, box dimensions 8.73 \u00d7 8.73 \u00d7 14.04 nm).\nFor each state, we produced two simulation replicates starting from two alternative\norientations of DyeC (Supplementary Figure S5) to overcome the problem of slow DyeC flipping from one side of the TM5-ICL3-TM6 fragment to the other side. In order to generate the two alternative starting conformations with the fluorescent label oriented on the opposite sides of the TM5-ICL3-TM6 fragment (i.e., pointing towards and outwards the protein center), we run short steered MD simulations with the moving harmonic potential (force constant of 1000 kJ/mol/nm2) applied to one of the carbon atoms of the dimethoxybenzene ring pulling it away from the protein center-of-mass with the constant velocity of 10-4 nm/ps. These steered simulations were conducted until the label flipped across ICL3 (~30 ns) and resulted in four starting conformations, i.e., two alternative label conformations for each state, active and inactive. The starting models were subjected to the standard CHARMM-GUI equilibration comprising a steep descent minimization followed by several short equilibration simulations, ~2 ns in total, with the harmonic restraints applied to the protein and lipids.\nAfter equilibrating the starting models according to the protocol described above, we\nperformed metadynamics MD simulations to estimate the three-dimensional free energy surfaces for the fluorescent label in the active/inactive states. Metadynamics is an enhanced sampling technique, which allows to reconstruct free energy profiles/surfaces along selected collective variable(s) by adding numerous repulsive potentials or \u201chills\u201d (typically, Gaussianshaped) to the total potential of the system forcing the latter to explore its configurational space faster and broader [54,55]. We have chosen three projections of the vector connecting the C\ud835\udefc atom of the label with the proximal carbon atom of its dimethoxybenzene ring onto the three Cartesian axes as the collective variables biased in the metadynamics simulations since they provide a straightforward and efficient way to describe the general orientation of the fluorescent label. Gaussian hills with the width of 0.1 nm and the height of 0.25 kJ/mol were added every 0.5 ps. The grid was used to efficiently store the accumulated hills. Each metadynamics simulation was run for 500 ns. The convergence of the simulations was estimated by calculating the volume explored by the label using the custom script available at\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The cumulative explored volume plotted as a function of simulation time is shown in Supplementary Figure S5.\nThroughout the equilibration and metadynamics simulations, positional restraints were\napplied to C\ud835\udefc atoms of the transmembrane region of A2AAR as well as to the intracellular segment of TM6 encompassing the labeling position 225 and its neighboring amino acids to preserve the protein state and to prevent fluctuations of the label\u2019s C\ud835\udefc atom, which was used as the reference point for calculation of the collective variables. Apart from it, we also applied dihedral restraints (force constant of 1000 kJ/mol/rad2) to the backbone atoms of the solventexposed protein regions in the \ud835\udefc-helical conformation.\nSince the relocation of the fluorescent label from one side of the TM5-ICL3-TM6\nfragment to the opposite side is a relative slow process particularly hindered by the restraints applied to the protein backbone and limiting the thorough sampling of label orientations, we run duplicate metadynamics simulations for each state starting from two alternative conformations of the label obtained as noted above.\nAdditionally, four unbiased simulations (i.e., without any external forces applied to a\nsystem) were run to estimate mobility of the DyeC label in the active and inactive A2AAR states starting from two alternative label orientations similar to the metadynamics simulations (see above). Each simulation was carried out for 1000 ns. The autocorrelation function was calculated as a measure for the mobility of fluorescent label using the rotacf tool in GROMACS according to the following expression, ACF(t) = <v(\u03c4)\u22c5v(\u03c4+t)>\u03c4, where v is a vector describing\nthe orientation of the fluorescent label and defined by C\ud835\udefc and the proximal carbon atom of the dimethoxybenzene ring of DyeC.\nAll MD simulations were performed by GROMACS version 2022.3 [74] with the\nPLUMED plugin, version 2.8.1 [75] allowing for metadynamics. A time step of 1-2 fs was used for equilibration simulations (3 \u00d7 125 ps with the 1-fs time step followed by 3 \u00d7 500 ps with the 2-fs time step), while all production metadynamics and unbiased simulations were performed with a 5 fs time step allowed by repartitioning the mass of heavy atoms into the bonded hydrogen atoms [76] and the LINCS constraint algorithm [77]. Production simulations were run in NVT ensemble with v-rescale thermostat (\u03c4T = 1.0 ps, Tref = 303.15 K), Van-derWaals interactions were treated using the cut-off scheme, electrostatics \u2013 using PME.\nThe Amber99SB-ILDN force field was used for the protein, lipids, and ions [78] along\nwith the TIP3P water model. The topology for the fluorescent label was obtained using Antechamber [79] with some dihedral parameters adopted from [80].
