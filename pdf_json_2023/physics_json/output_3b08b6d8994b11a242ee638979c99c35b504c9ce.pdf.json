Therefore, developing inexpensive and effective catalysts for BzOH oxidation is essential. Due to the synergistic effect between the two metals, bimetallic catalysts have greater catalytic activity and selectivity than monometallic catalysts in the selective oxidation of BzOH.19,20 Wu et al.19 reported that Au\u2013Pd NPs supported on foamlike mesoporous silica exhibited a remarkable synergistic effect for the selective oxidation of BzOH. They found that the catalytic activity of bimetallic Au\u2013Pd catalysts (TOF= 50 000\u201360 000 h\u22121) for BzOH oxidation was much higher than that of monometallic Pd catalyst (TOF = 12 500 h\u22121).19 Yi\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The Au\u2013Ni bimetallic NPs anchored on the ordered array of extra-large mesopores (EP-FDU-12 support) displayed superior catalytic activity (TOF= 59 000 h\u22121, 240 \u00b0C) and space-time yield (STY) of BzH productivity (9.23 kg gAu\n\u22121 h\u22121) in the oxidation of BzOH, which is higher than that of the monometallic Au NPs catalyst (TOF = 15 000 h\u22121 and STY = 1.76 kg gAu \u22121 h\u22121).21\nGraphenes are fascinating two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials that have attracted the interest of scientists and engineers.22\u201324 Due to their high surface-to-volume aspect ratios, unique electronic properties, excellent physicochemical properties, and high chemical and thermal stability, graphene has been increasingly utilized as a carrier to stabilize and support nanoparticles in recent years.25\u201328 Moreover, graphene contains carbon vacancy defects and different functional groups, and metal ions can be easily adsorbed onto the graphene surface, forming thermally stable composite materials.29 Guo et al.26 assembled nitrogen-regulated graphene-supported iron nanoparticles using a microwave assembly technique. The 15%Fe/ AG(12 h)\u2013W(10) catalyst displayed excellent catalytic performance for Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis, with CO conversion and C5+ selectivity reaching 97.2% and 40.0%, respectively, while maintaining mild CO2 selectivity (28.2%).26 Han et al.28 reported that bimetallic Pd\u2013Ag/rGO catalysts synthesized via one-step biosynthesis displayed superior catalytic performance in reducing 4-nitrophenol. The kinetic rate constant of the asprepared Pd\u2013Ag/rGO for 4-nitrophenol reduction was 0.2413 min\u22121, which is higher than that reported catalysts for 4- nitrophenol reduction.28 Gao et al.30 reported that a trace amount of SnO2 formed around graphene-Pd and graphene-Pt was benecial to the enhancement of activity for alcohol oxidation. Wen et al.31 found that the presence of SnO2 may be benecial to the oxidation of intermediate COads on Pd, leading to the enhancement of electrochemical activity. Sn\u2013W/RGO showed higher catalytic activity than single WO3/graphene catalyst for selective oxidation of alcohols using H2O2 as oxidant without organic solvents and any additives.32 Sn species can induce the formation of hexagonal WO3 with dominant exposed (001) and (200) planes, dramatically increase the specic surface area, change the structural properties and enhance the interactions between Sn\u2013W oxides and RGO.32 Li et al.33 found that Sn\u2013W/RGO presented excellent catalytic properties for the reaction of BzOH to BzH. The BzOH conversion signicantly increased, and the BzH selectivity reached 87.38%.33 RamirezBarria et al.34 reported that Ru(CO)/NrGO (NrGO:N-doped reduced graphene oxide) displayed excellent BzOH conversions (50%) and BzH selectivity (>99%). The catalyst Ti(SO4)2/ GOF (Ti(SO4)2: titanium sulfate; GOF: graphene oxide foam) showed unique catalytic activity (BzOH conversion 91.3%) and selectivity (99.0%) for the oxidation of BzOH to BzH using THF as solvent and H2O2 as oxidant.35 And Ti(SO4)2/GOF could be reused ten times without signicant loss of BzOH conversion and selectivity.35\nIn this study, Au\u2013Sn bimetallic NPs and Au or Sn NPs supported on graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The oxidation of BzOH was used to compare the catalytic properties of the Au\u2013Sn bimetallic- and Au/Sn monometallic catalysts. The solvent type, reaction time, pressure, and temperature of the asprepared catalysts were optimized for the selective oxidation of BzOH. The effect of the synthetic method, NP size, and support properties was also investigated. In addition, the reusability of the catalysts and their potential mechanisms were investigated in detail.

The Au 4f and Sn 3d binding energies of the bimetallic AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGOTS catalysts exhibited a negative shi toward lower binding energies than those of the monometallic catalysts, indicating a strong interaction between Au and Sn in the Au\u2013Sn bimetallic catalysts.39\nFig. 3 and 4, and S2\u2013S7\u2020 depict the TEM, HAADF-STEM, and EDS images of the Au\u2013Sn bimetallic and Au or Sn monometallic catalysts, respectively. Au\u2013Sn, Au, and Sn NPs were uniformly distributed on the GO or rGO support, as evidenced by TEM and HAADF-STEM images. The Au\u2013Sn bimetallic particle size distribution histograms for the AuSn/GO-TS, AuSn/GO-CoIM, AuSn/rGO-TS, and AuSn/rGO-CoIM catalysts were obtained through statistical analysis of over 300 Au\u2013Sn particles. The size of the Au\u2013Sn nanoparticles in Au\u2013Sn bimetallic catalysts varies depending on the synthesis method. AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/ rGO-TS catalysts exhibited average Au\u2013Sn NP sizes of 15.2 and 5.2 nm, while AuSn/GO-CoIM and AuSn/rGO-CoIM catalysts exhibited average Au\u2013Sn NP sizes of 73.1 and 43.9 nm, respectively (Fig. 3, 4 and S2, S3\u2020).

The turnover frequency (TOF) was 64.8, 48.4, 89.2, and 62.5 h\u22121 based on the total Au content under the optical reaction conditions for AuSn/GO-TS, AuSn/GO-CoIM, AuSn/ rGO-TS, and AuSn/rGO-CoIM, respectively (Table 1, entries 1, 22; Table S1,\u2020 entries 7, 10). AuSn/GO-TS catalysts with an NP size of 15.2 nm exhibited greater catalytic activity than AuSn/ GO-CoIM catalysts (73.1 nm). AuSn/rGO-TS catalysts with an average Au\u2013Sn NP size of 5.2 nm exhibited a greater level of activity than AuSn/rGO-CoIM catalysts (43.9 nm). AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS catalysts exhibited signicantly enhanced activities compared to AuSn/GO-CoIM and AuSn/rGO-CoIM catalysts, which was primarily attributable to the smaller size of the Au\u2013Sn bimetallic NPs produced by the two-step immobilization method.

The basal planes of GO contain O doping in the form of functional groups such as hydroxyl and epoxy groups, and the edges of the sheet also contain carboxyl and carbonyl groups.54 The enhancement of the catalytic activity of AuSn/GO-TS may be attributable to the impact of the support properties.\nAu\u2013Sn bimetallic catalysts supported on GO and rGO (AuSn/ GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS) exhibited signicantly higher activity than Au or Sn monometallic catalysts (Au/GO, Sn/GO, Au/rGO and Sn/rGO).

The stability of the AuSn/GOTS and AuSn/rGO-TS catalysts were studied at 90 \u00b0C (AuSn/GOTS) or 100 \u00b0C (AuSn/rGO-TS) under 3 bar of O2 within 2 h (Fig. 5). Aer each reaction, the catalysts were collected by centrifugation, dried at 100 \u00b0C under vacuum, and reused for subsequent runs. In the second, third, and fourth reaction runs the BzOH conversions decreased. In contrast, the selectivities of BzH increased during the second, third, and fourth cycles of reaction. In a series of 4 consecutive runs, AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/ rGO-TS catalysts demonstrated stable BzH yields over four consecutive runs (AuSn/GO-TS: 46.8\u201349.3%; AuSn/rGO-TS: 29.2\u2013 30.9%). Fig. 6 showed the XPS spectra of reused AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS. The Au in the reused AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS catalysts existed as metallic Au (Au0), indicating that there were no change for the valence states of Au for the reused AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS during the process of BzOH oxidation reaction.41 However, the ratios of Sn2+ to Sn4+ were increased compared to fresh AuSn/GO-TS (0.91) and AuSn/ rGO-TS (1.09). The values of Sn2+/Sn4+ are 1.06 and 1.18 for the reused AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS, respectively.42 The decrease in conversion and increase in selectivity of the reused AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS catalysts aer each run may be caused by the partial conversion of Sn4+ to Sn2+.\nThe leaching of AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS were tested to examine if there were any Au or Sn active species in the reaction solution that could catalyze the BzOH oxidation reaction. The hot ltration tests were carried out by stopping the BzOH oxidation aer 1 h under 3 bar of O2 at 90 \u00b0C or 100 \u00b0C using THF as solvent. The BzOH conversions and BzH selectivities were 28.5% and 85.5%, and 57% and 50.3% for the AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS, respectively. Then AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/ rGO-TS catalysts were removed from the reaction solution by centrifugation. The reaction solution was transferred to another 10 mL high-pressure reactor and continued to react for 1 h under the same reaction conditions. The BzOH conversions increased by 5.3% and 5.9% for AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS, respectively. The BzH selectivities decreased by 5.6% and 5.4% over AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS, respectively.

The decline of BzOH conversions in the second, third, and fourth reaction runs was also possibly due to the leaching of Au and Sn under experimental conditions.\nScheme 1 presents a possible catalytic mechanism based on AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS based on the related reports.8,62,63 We believe that BzOH oxidation over Au\u2013Sn bimetallic catalysts was initiated by oxidative dehydrogenation of BzOH taking place on Au\u2013Sn bimetallic sites. The role of O2 in the oxidation\nScheme 1 Probable mechanism of BzOH oxidation by AuSn/GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS.\n23656 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 23648\u201323658\nreaction was to remove H from the Au\u2013Sn NP surface and regenerate the catalysts. First, BzOH can be chemisorbed on the Au\u2013Sn bimetallic sites, and then hydrogen is extracted from the \u2013CH2\u2013 of BzOH to generate the H\u2013AuSn\u2013alcoholate intermediate. The intermediate underwent b-hydride elimination, releasing the nal product, BzH, and forming AuSn\u2013H species. Subsequently, the AuSn\u2013H intermediate reacts with 1/2O2 to produce H2O and regenerates the Au\u2013Sn bimetallic catalysts. The regenerated catalysts can continue to participate in BzOH oxidation and complete the next catalytic cycle."

The results of the characterization showed that the average Au\u2013Sn NPs of AuSn/ GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS prepared by two-step immobilization were smaller than the average Au\u2013Sn NPs of the catalysts prepared by co-immobilization. Upon evaluating the oxidation of BzOH to BzH over the prepared catalysts in the presence of molecular oxygen, the Au\u2013Sn bimetallic catalysts exhibited greater activity than the monometallic catalysts, and the AuSn/ GO-TS and AuSn/rGO-TS catalysts performed better than the AuSn/GO-CoIM and AuSn/rGO-CoIM catalysts. Under optimal conditions, the BzOH conversions and BzH yields of AuSn/GOTS and AuSn/rGO-TS were 87.8% and 49.3%, and 88.6% and 35.5%, respectively.
