    "abstractText": "Carlina vulgaris is a little-understood plant with unexplored biological potential, and the papers regarding its chemical composition are scarce. In our study, for the first time, the phytochemical profile of the plant, focusing on polar metabolites, was established using modern chromatographic techniques including LC-HRMS-QTOF-CAD, UHPLC-PDA-MS. Phytochemical analysis revealed that the species is a rich source of polyphenolic components, with the most abundant being chlorogenic acid and C-glycosides of luteolin, including carlinoside, orientin, isoorientin, and C-glycosides of apigenin, schaftoside, isoschaftoside, and vitexin. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of the polyphenolic-rich fraction of C. vulgaris extracts on human skin fibroblasts using the MTT and NR assays. It was found that the extract was non-toxic and exhibited potent antioxidant activity in the cells subjected to induced oxidative stress. Additionally, it effectively protected the cells against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. Our study contributes to the general trend of searching for new phytotherapeutics with potential applications in pharmacy and medicine. The results indicate that further exploration of C. vulgaris species is worthwhile, as they can serve as valuable plant material for",

Plants from the genus Carlina have been widely used in traditional medicine in many countries, including Spain, Italy, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, and the Balkan countries, due to their high potential for medicinal purposes [1\u20138]. They have been applied to gastrointestinal dysfunctions such as gastritis and dyspepsia and as a cholagogic agent [2,3]. Furthermore, extracts from the herbs have been found to be useful in facilitating the healing of skin lesions, wounds, ulcerations, skin infections, rough skin, and swellings [1,9\u201311].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5422. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28145422 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5422 2 of 14\nHowever, to date, most species from the genus are poorly understood in terms of both biological activity and phytochemistry.

Discussion Carlina vulgaris is a little-understood plant with unexplored biological potential, and papers regarding its chemical composition are scarce. To date, only a few triterpenic compounds and chlorogenic acid have been identified in the aboveground parts and roots of C. vulgaris [23,28]. In turn, analysis of the root essential oil revealed the presence of thirteen volatile components, with the prevalence of polyacetylenes, carlina oxide, and its 13-methoxy derivative [29]. Our study shows that the aboveground parts of C. vulgaris are a rich source of polyphenolic components from the phenolic acids and flavonoids classes, with the most abundant being flavonoid C-glycosides. In contrast to the most widespread O-glycosides, in which the sugar is linked to the aglycone via an oxygen atom, the characteristic feature of C-glycosides is the attachment of sugar moieties directly to the flavonoid backbone through C-C covalent bonds. This makes their structure more stable than O-glycosides, and therefore, C-glycosides differ in pharmacokinetics and biological activities [31,32,33]. C-glycosides are relatively less studied flavonoid derivatives; however, recent literature data have shown that they possess many beneficial effects and health-promoting properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-diabetic, antiinflammatory, neuroprotective, and antihypertensive potential [31,34,35,36,37,38].

Our investigation for the first time reveals that C. vulgaris contains a high amount of C-glycosides of luteolin, including carlinoside, orientin, isoorientin, and C-glycosides of apigenin, schaftoside, isoschaftoside, and vitexin. Some of these C-glycosides, namely orientin, homoorientin, vitexin, and isoschaftoside, were previously detected in another Carlina species\u2014C. acaulis [39,40]. However, quantitative data regarding their amounts were lacking. Fractionation of the methanolic extract with ethyl acetate yielded a polyphenolic-rich fraction (EaCV) which showed a protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative stress 253 and prevented H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. It can be supposed that the effect was related with polyphenolic compounds which are known for their potent antioxidant properties and beneficial effects on cell metabolism [41,42]. For example, it has been evidenced that chlorogenic acid (CA), an abundant component of C. vulgaris, stimulates the proliferation of skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and it contributes to the production of matrix proteins. It also exhibits a strong protective effect against oxidative stress [43\u201346]. Free radical scavenging effects and protective activities against reactive oxygen species (ROS) have also been found for many flavonoid C-glycosides in both in vitro and in vivo assays. It has been reported that vitexin acts as an effective radical scavenger and protects against lipid peroxidation and other oxidative damages in various oxidative stress-related diseases [47]. Additionally, orientin and vitexin have been shown to improve the endogenous antioxidant status in the organism and increase levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in the serum [48]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that isoschaftoside, isovitexin, vitexin, and orientin protect against lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammation [37,49]. Plant products with high antioxidant activity are strongly desirable components of skin care products. It is well known that oxidative stress plays a significant role in skin aging and favors the development of skin-related disorders. Excessive exposure to reactive oxygen species disturbs cellular redox balance and consequently leads to the damage and dysfunction of the cells. ROS may modify the micro-environment of the skin through modulation of the extracellular matrix and affect the matrix metalloproteinases responsible for tissue remodeling, which leads to structural and functional alterations in skin, including collagen fragmentation and disorganization of collagen fibers. Furthermore, ROS-related cell damage increases the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes a chronic inflammatory state [50\u201352]. All these processes accelerate skin aging. Our study has revealed that C. vulgaris is rich in polyphenolic compounds with healthpromoting properties. Therefore, it is worthwhile to continue investigating this plant and exploring other potential courses of action.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5422 10 of 14"
