INTRODUCTION\nHumans posses a remarkable ability for pattern recognition that is however still quickly overwhelmed when analysing complex systems. When dealing with time series of two or three dimensional field snapshots, as is common in e.g. hydrodynamics, we are often forced to use reductions that decrease complexity and provide an approachable insight into the system\u2019s behaviour. An example of such reduction when dealing with natural convection is tracking the ratio between heat convection and conduction, also known as the Nusselt number, on a significant boundary. The Nusselt number provides us with a scalar value that reflects the behaviour in our system. Analysing time series of such values can provide insight on whether the system is stable, oscillatory or maybe even chaotic, with Fourier analysis available as a potent tool to extract the characteristic frequencies reflected in the chosen reduction. No matter how good the reduction is we still lose the majority of the spatial detail which is often important for understanding the dynamics.\nSpatial structure of the analysed system is required for good understanding of the dynamics, which is especially important when dealing with engineering challenges like the airflow around aircraft structures [1]. A common approach to identifying important spatial structures in analysed fields is modal decomposition, with Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) research core funding No. P2-0095 and the Young Researcher program PR-10468.\n(POD)1, proposed for hydrodynamics by Lumley [2] in 1967, and it\u2019s variations [3], [4] as one of the most widely used techniques. POD is a decomposition technique that identifies orthogonal modes that best2 represent the dataset and provides an ordering based on their importance.\nModes obtained with POD provide information about energetically important parts of the system but are completely oblivious to the temporal behaviour meaning that the results of the decomposition would stay the same even if analysis was performed on reordered snapshots. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) was proposed by Schmid in a 2008 talk and the subsequent paper in 2010 [6] as a technique that joins the spatial aspects of POD and temporal aspects of Fourier transform [4]. DMD identifies characteristic frequencies, corresponding spatial structures and whether they amplify, decay or remain constant through the sampled timespan. The method was initially proposed for hydrodynamics but has since found other applications including infectious disease spread [7] and computer vision [8] as it is completely data-driven and independent of the underlying dynamics.\nThis paper introduces the DMD algorithm and interpretation in Sec. II, demonstrates the results on vibrating membrane examples in Sec. III and concludes with the decomposition applied to a more interesting case of oscillatory non-Newtonian natural convection in Sec. IV."

Interpretation\nThe DMD algorithm is based on finding eigenvalues \u03bb and eigenvectors \u03d5 of the linear mapping represented by the matrix A\nvi+1 = Avi, (1)\nthat connects the subsequent states vi and vi+1 of the analysed system. As such the algorithm is completely independent of the governing equations that drive the underlying dynamics and can be applied to any experimental or simulated data.\n1Also known as principal component analysis (PCA) and various other names in different fields.\n2Optimally in L2 sense that corresponds to energy when decomposing flow field [5].\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n04 72\n8v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nN A\n] 9\nM ar\n2 02\nThe linear nature of eigendecomposition does not preclude us from analysing non-linear systems as the dynamics of any such system can be expressed with an infinite-dimensional linear Koopman operator [9] with the DMD providing a good approximation of it\u2019s eigendecomposition as long as the quality and quantity of input data is sufficient [10].\nDMD eigenvalues \u03bb provide information about the temporal behaviour of the spatial structure described in the eigenvector. Eigenvalues are complex numbers with the mode\u2019s angular frequency information contained in the argument\n\u03bdi = arg(\u03bbi)\n2\u03c0\u2206t , (2)\nwith sampling interval \u2206t providing scaling to the output, that is otherwise unaffected by the frequency of data snapshot sampling. The magnitude of eigenvalues provides information about changes in mode\u2019s strength, with |\u03bb| > 1 for amplifying and |\u03bb| < 1 for decaying modes.\nThe linear combination of DMD modes calculated from real valued input data has to be real valued, which can be satisfied either by real eigenvalues/eigenvectors or complex-conjugate pairs of complex eigenvalues/eigenvectors. Real eigenvalues represent modes with frequency 0. At least one such background mode with frequency 0 and eigenvalue magnitude of 1 is present whenever the decomposed data has nonzero average but multiple such real-valued growing/decaying non-oscillatory modes can appear. Complex conjugate pairs represent oscillating modes and can be treated as a single mode and will be in most of the later visualisations."

            "text": "The algorithm for exact DMD proposed by Tu [11] starts by taking subsequent snapshots vi of analysed fields separated by \u2206t. Uniformly sampled snapshots simplify calculation and frequency interpretation but are not explicitly required for DMD. Snapshots are flattened from their arbitrary shape into vectors with length M and arranged as columns in a matrix\nV Ni = [ vi vi+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vN ] , (3)\nwith N denoting the number of snapshots. The number of data points in a snapshot M is usually much larger than the number of snapshots N , leading to tall and narrow matrices V Ni that can be exploited to efficiently calculate the eigendecomposition of the large M \u00d7M matrix A.\nThe snapshot matrix V Ni needs to have a sufficient 3 rank to describe the dynamics. Rank deficiency issues usually appear when dealing with standing waves [10], [12] that cause a linear dependency between snapshots in columns of V Ni and can be solved by stacking subsequent snapshots\nV Ni =  vi vi+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vN\u2212m vi+1 vi+2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vN\u2212m+1 ... ... . . .\n... vi+m vi+m+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vN , (4) 3Generally at least two times the number of relevant oscillatory modes.\nensuring rank(V Ni ) >= m at the cost of effectively larger system, and only using the first M values from the now larger DMD eigenvectors. Time shift augmentation can also help with noisy data or in cases where snapshots are small [12].\nFor simplicity we continue our discussion with the notation from Eq. (3), apply the relationship from Eq. (1) to the matrix\nV N1 = [ Av0 Avi \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 AvN\u22121 ] = AV N\u221210 , (5)\nand perform the compact singular value decomposition (SVD) on the data matrix\nV N\u221210 = USW \u2020. (6)\nThe results of the SVD can already be assigned physical meaning as it is one of the two main algorithms used to compute POD. Singular values denoting the importance of POD modes are contained in the diagonal S with the corresponding eigenvectors in columns of U . The complexity of the underlying dynamics can be estimated from the spectrum of singular values. Cases with exponentially decreasing singular value magnitudes signify a low-dimensional behaviour that can be described with a handful of modes. Slow decay is not as simple to explain as it can be a product of either very complex dynamics or noisy data.\nOutput of the SVD algorithm can be truncated based on singular values or prior knowledge about the system to retain only r singular values and corresponding singular vectors in U and W . Truncation is beneficial as it reduces the number of numerical operations, as evident from the following paragraph, and removes noise, but care has to be taken in order to avoid truncating relevant parts of the dynamics. More details about truncation with examples and advanced strategies are available in [12].\nThe optionally truncated result can be reorganized and rewritten as\nU \u2020V N1 WS \u22121 = U \u2020AU := A\u0303, (7)\nwith A\u0303 representing the projection of A onto the POD eigenvectors. We then perform the eigendecomposition of A\u0303 which is a much smaller r \u00d7 r matrix than the full, M \u00d7M sized, matrix A. The decomposition\nA\u0303w = \u03bbw.

This deficiency is bypassed\nby calculating the projection coefficients for expressing the measured datasets in terms of DMD eigenvectors\nv(t) = \u2211 k \u03d5kbk(t). (10)\nAs the relative importance of eigenvectors in an oscillating dataset changes with time it is best to calculate their importance for all available snapshots expressed in matrix form as\nV N\u221210 = \u03a6B, (11)\nwith eigenvectors collected in columns of matrix \u03a6 =[ \u03d50 \u03d51 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03d5r ] and coefficients corresponding to\ndatasets in V N\u221210 collected as columns in matrix B =[ b0 b1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bN\u22121 ] .

A subset of system state snapshots for the 0 damping case that that we use in DMD is shown in the right graphs of Figure 2. The dynamics are disordered due to the nonsymmetric position of the initial jolt and do not offer much insight at the first glance. We can use the sum of membrane heights as an observable that reduces the system\u2019s behaviour into a single scalar value to visualise the oscillation and the effect of different damping rates as shown in the left graph of Figure 2.\nWe use DMD on 1000 uniformly sampled snapshots from the interval t \u2208 [0, 10] that are composed into the data matrix V with stacking m = 10. Each snapshot is composed of 3985 height values in computational nodes for the mesh-free partial differential equation solving, which are uniformly positioned within \u2126.\nThe resulting frequencies, calculated from DMD eigenvalues as described in Eq. (2), are shown in the top graph of Figure 3. The results provide a good estimation for the analytic results with sub percent relative error for the first \u223c 30 modes as shown in the central graph. Estimated frequencies remain good even for the relatively strongly damped \u03b3 = 1 case showing promise for eigenfrequency estimation on experimental data obtained from complex objects.\nThere is a slight inconsistency in the results with a sharp increase in the relative error for the \u03b3 = 0 frequencies. We would expect that the least damped case would give the best results but there seems to be an additional non-physical mode at index 11 that has caused a shift in the following frequencies. Fortunately we can use the mode power described in Sec. II-C and shown in the bottom graph of Figure 3 to detect and remove the highlighted spurious mode with a significantly lower strength. It is surprising how little nonsensical modes we identified even though we initially disturbed the membrane in a non-symmetric location and how chaotic the actual system shown in the heat maps of Figure 2 looks to a human observer.\nWe can also compare the analytic eigenvectors shown in Figure 1 and DMD eigenvectors in Figure 4. The DMD vector positions in the grid are shifted by one compared to the analytic due to the non-oscillatory background mode that is always present in the decomposition of data with nonzero average. Some eigenvectors match almost perfectly while others wildly differ. This might seem inconsistent at the first glance but can be explained with degeneracy in the analytical spectrum. Linear combinations of degenerate eigenvectors still constitute a valid eigenvector. The non-symmetric eigenvector \u03d511 can quickly be identified as the one corresponding to the previously mentioned spurious mode."

            "text": "Now that we have shown that DMD can be used to identify inherent oscillatory modes we apply it to an irregularly shaped\nmembrane. The duck-shaped membrane is again disturbed with a Gaussian initial state, resulting in the oscillation shown in Figure 5. This combination of meshless computational nodes, the time evolution of the system, the DMD spectrum, and the DMD eigenvectors ordered by frequency provides a condensed overview of the dynamics and shows how DMD could be used in engineering analysis. The DMD spectrum is a convenient and commonly used display of DMD mode frequency and power in the same graph, which can, when sorted by frequency, be used similarly to the Fourier transform."

We solve, with details available in [15], the\nsystem of partial differential equations\n\u2207 \u00b7 v = 0, (17)\n\u03c1( \u2202v\n\u2202t + v \u00b7\u2207v) = \u2212\u2207p+\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b7\u2207v)\u2212 g\u03c1\u03b2T\u2206, (18)\n\u03c1cp( \u2202T\n\u2202t + v \u00b7\u2207T ) =\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03bb\u2207T ), (19)\n\u03b7 = \u03b70\n( 1\n2 \u2225\u2225\u2207v + (\u2207v)T\u2225\u2225)n\u221212 . (20) with v, T , p, \u03c1, g, \u03b2, T\u2206, cp, \u03b70, n representing the flow velocity field, temperature field, pressure field, density, gravity, thermal expansion coefficient, temperature offset, heat capacity, viscosity constant and non-Newtonian index respectively.\nThe system is used to describe the natural convection in an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid. Non-Newtonian fluids have a variable viscosity meaning that the relationship between the shear-strain and the shear-stress is non-linear. We use a simple power-law model to describe the relationship with nonNewtonian power index n as the main parameter of behaviour. Smaller values of n indicate stronger shear-thinning nonNewtonian effects while n = 1 equals to a normal, Newtonian, fluid.\nWe will be using the dimensionless Rayleigh number (Ra) that has a similar meaning for natural convection as Reynolds number, meaning stronger dynamics for higher values, as a case parameter, with details unimportant for the demonstration.\nThe model is solved in a square cavity with differentially heated walls schematically shown in the upper left graph of\nFigure 6. The left and right walls are kept at a temperature differential causing the fluid to form a vortex as it heats and rises at the right boundary and cools and descends on the left. This circulation is stationary for low Ra with a transition into an oscillatory and later chaotic regime as Ra increases. The upper right graphs in Figure 6 show a selection of system temperature and velocity field snapshots for the oscillatory behaviour at Ra= 106. A set of parameters where the transition into the oscillatory behaviour occurs has been identified by Kosec et al. [16] and we use DMD to analyse the differences in dynamics as we push past that point with increasing Ra and decreasing n.\nAs mentioned in the introduction we can use the Nusselt number, shown in the bottom graph of Figure 6, as an observable into the systems behaviour. The system is stationary for Ra= 5 \u00b7 103 and n = 1 but oscillations occur both when we increase Ra and when we decrease n.\nWe use DMD to decompose the 5 cases utilising 500 snapshots of the system between t = 10 and t = 11 with stacking m = 5. The results are shown in Figure 7a for increasing Ra and Figure 7b for decreasing n. The mode power defined in Eq. (12) is used to identify the strongest modes and display the corresponding eigenvectors. The first observation that is common to both modes of spurring the dynamics pertains to the DMD spectrum. The initial stationary case has the vast majority of its power in the first constant mode with others most likely only containing noise. As the intensity of the dynamics increases we get more distinct modes but the power of the background modes also increases as expected with ever wilder dynamics heading towards chaos, where all modes would be present and indistinguishable by power.\nWe can be reasonably certain that the oscillatory dynamics are in fact different for the Ra and n spurred dynamics by using the eigenvectors of DMD modes sorted by power to identify the important parts. The strongest areas are clearly\ndifferent with eigenvectors for the Ra induced dynamics in Figure 7a present mainly as perturbations to the main central vortex while the modes for the n induced dynamics in Figure 7b point to activity in corners where counter vortices occur. This is consistent with the typical shear-thinning nonNewtonian behaviour where the larger velocity gradients are penalised less providing better conditions for smaller vortices."

            "text": "We have presented the algorithm for dynamic mode decomposition and applied it to various test and example cases. The examples progressed from the most basic, where we were able to verify the results agains known closed-form values, towards a concrete hydrodynamics example where DMD provided valuable insight into the system that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. The DMD has proved to be a very practical tool for dynamical system analysis and it is recommended that anyone dealing with hydrodynamics or similarly complex systems should be at least familiar with its fundamentals. The algorithm is only a decade old and has an active community working on extensions for the concept of Koopman operator decomposition and applications for the existing versions of DMD."
