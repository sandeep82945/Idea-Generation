    "abstractText": "Plasmonic nanomaterials have attracted great attention in the field of catalysis and sensing for their outstanding electrical and optical properties. Here, a representative type of nonstoichiometric Cu2\u2212xSe nanoparticles with typical near-infrared (NIR) localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) properties originating from their copper deficiency was applied to catalyze the oxidation of colorless TMB into their blue product in the presence of H2O2, indicating they had good peroxidase-like activity. However, glutathione (GSH) inhibited the catalytic oxidation of TMB, as it can consume the reactive oxygen species. Meanwhile, it can induce the reduction of Cu(II) in Cu2\u2212xSe, resulting in a decrease in the degree of copper deficiency, which can lead to a reduction in the LSPR. Therefore, the catalytic ability and photothermal responses of Cu2\u2212xSe were decreased. Thus, in our work, a colorimetric/photothermal dual-readout array was developed for the detection of GSH. The linear calibration for GSH concentration was in the range of 1\u201350 \u03bcM with the LOD as 0.13 \u03bcM and 50\u2013800 \u03bcM with the LOD as 39.27 \u03bcM. To evaluate the practicability of the assay, tomatoes and cucumbers were selected as real samples, and good recoveries indicated that the developed assay had great potential in real applications.",

            "text": "Doped semiconductor nanocrystals with a dynamic manipulation of carrier densities have attracted great attention in the field of sensing, catalysis and photonics technologies [1\u20133]. They show plasmonic optical responses similar to the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) of noble metals, such as Ag and Au nanomaterials [4,5]. However, their plasmonic spectroscopic signature tuning can be achieved by modulating their doping which is not easily realized by metal nanoparticles [6]. Recently, research has been focused on semiconductor nanocrystals based on earth-abundant transition metals such as copper for their low cost [7,8]. Nonstoichiometric copper selenide nanoparticles (Cu2\u2212xSe) are a typical self-doped representative with a high carrier (holes) concentration leading to the evolution of NIR LSPR [9,10]. The Cu(I)/Cu(II) always coexists in these nanocrystals (NCs), acting as a source of optically active holes, and the optical properties can be adjusted effectively by the Cu-defect, exhibiting a blueshift or redshift in the absorption spectrum located in the NIR [11,12]. Many reports have shown that their LSPR tunability in a broad wavelength range can be controlled either by developing synthesis strategies or performing red\u2013ox reactions in the post-synthesis [13\u201316]. It has been proved that the stoichiometric form Cu2Se does not provide plasmon resonances, while its nonstoichiometric composition Cu2\u2212xSe induced a localized surface plasmon extinction band in the NIR for the introduction of Cu(II) [17,18]. This phenomenon was confirmed by Dorfs et al., who showed that the addition of an excess of Cu+ ions could result in a reduction in the NIR LSPR band, but\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1787. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13111787 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1787 2 of 11\nthe addition of an oxidizer Ce(IV) could enhance the plasmon band due to the increase in copper vacancies [19]. It is worth mentioning that high copper vacancies can make Cu2\u2212xSe good electron donors and acceptors; thus, they have the good catalytic ability by facilitating electron transfer [20,21]. Our group demonstrated that copper vacancies acted as reactive sites for the enhancement of chemiluminescence (CL) in the luminol\u2013H2O2 system [22]. Furthermore, the coexistence of Cu(I)/Cu(II) in the Cu2\u2212xSe nanocrystals was similar to the Fenton reagent [23\u201327]. Thus, they were proved to exhibit a peroxidase-like activity which could accelerate the oxidation of colorless 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to its blue product (oxidized TMB, OxTMB) with H2O2. Based on the catalytic activity of Cu2\u2212xSe, some colorimetric assays for measuring various targets have been developed [28\u201330]. Compared with photoluminescence, photothermal responses mainly result from local temperature changes, which lead to a high sensitivity because of the low background noise [31,32]. Hessel et al. proved that Cu2\u2212xSe nanocrystals exhibited an intense NIR absorbance peak and exhibited marked photoinduced heating as Au nanorods and Au nanoshells excited by a NIR laser [33]. Due to the high and stable photothermal conversion, low toxicity, and easy preparation, Cu2\u2212xSe nanomaterials have been used as promising photothermal agents in photothermal therapy and sensing [34\u201339]. The adjustability of the photothermal efficiency due to their dynamic LSPR properties made a photothermal signal of Cu2\u2212xSe nanomaterials available for qualitative analysis [40]. Glutathione (GSH), as a typical biological thiol, performs many physiological functions in the biological systems [41\u201343]. However, they can be oxidized to GSSG by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced by aging or diseases [44,45]. Thus, GSH is commonly used in various medicinal and functional foods to serve as an anti-aging and immunityenhancing component [46]. However, an overdose of GSH can result in many diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, liver damage and cancer et al. [47]. It strongly suggests that a GSH balance should be maintained. Therefore, an accurate GSH quantification in medicine and foods is essential to provide a reference for the daily GSH supplement for disease prevention and treatment. Currently, the reported assays for GSH include fluorescence [48], colorimetric [49], electrochemiluminescence [50], etc. To meet the growing demand for sensing technology, the integration of two sensing signals in dual-mode sensing technology not only reduces assumptions but also increases the linear range of detection and application flexibility [51]. Based on the above consideration, the Cu2\u2212xSe nanoparticles in which Cu(I)/Cu(II) coexisted, acting as a source of optically active holes, were used to catalyze the oxidation of colorless TMB into its blue product in the presence of H2O2. In the catalytic process, the Cu2\u2212xSe nanoparticles showed peroxidase-like activity. In the presence of GSH, the peroxidase-like activity of Cu2\u2212xSe was inhibited, and its NIR LSPR was decreased. Thus, a colorimetric/photothermal dualreadout array based on the copper deficiency modulation of Cu2\u2212xSe was developed for the detection of GSH (Scheme 1).\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 11\nal., who showed that the addition of an excess of Cu+ ions could result in a reduction in the NIR LSPR band, but the addition of an oxidizer Ce(IV) could enhance the plasmon band due to the increase in copper vacancies [19].

As shown n Figures 2a and S1, only in th coexistence of H2O2 and Cu2\u2212xSe, the colorless TMB could be oxidated as its blue derivative OxTMB, with a typical absorption peak at 650 nm. The steady-state kinetics behavior w s studied at room temperature, nd he catalytic reaction kinetics of Cu2\u2212xSe nan particles followed the typical ichaelis-M nten model, which was consistent with the kinetic characteristics of horseradish p roxidase, HRP, indirectly indicated the peroxidase-mimicking activity of Cu2\u2212xSe nanopa ticles (Figure 2b,c). Additionally, the cal ulated kinetic parameters (Table S1) and the Km values towards H2O2 and TMB of Cu2\u2212xSe were slig tly l wer th n those of natural HRP. In order to further investigate the stability of Cu2\u2212xSe as catalysts, the changes in the enzyme activity of Cu2\u2212xSe nanoparticles were tested at different pH and temperatures (Figure S2).

It was found that Cu2\u2212xSe nanoparticles could have good enzyme activity in a wide range of pH and temperature, which was also an important advantage for further application.\nHowever, the absorbance at 650 nm declined, and the visible color was changed from blue to colorless with the addition of GSH, suggesting that GSH could dramatically inhibit the catalytic process of Cu2\u2212xSe (Figure 2d). Meanwhile, the change in the absorption intensity at 650 nm varied with the GSH concentration. On the basis of the above phenomenon, a colorimetric method for the quantitative detection of GSH was designed by monitoring the changes in absorbance at 650 nm.\n3.3. Optimization of Experimental Conditions The optimal experimental conditions were investigated by the univariate method, including pH, TMB concentration, Cu2\u2212xSe concentration and H2O2 concentration. As shown in Figure S3a, the PBS buffer with a different pH was added to the system. With the increase in the pH value, the change in \u0394A/A0 first increased and then decreased, and the maximum value was obtained when the pH was 6.5. Therefore, pH 6.5 was selected as the optimum value. Then, with the fixed pH at 6.5, different concentrations of TMB, Cu2\u2212xSe and H2O2 were investigated in turn. As shown in Figure S3b\u2013d, the maximum \u0394A/A0 was reached when the concentration of TMB was 1.5 mM, Cu2\u2212xSe was 25 \u00b5g/Ml, and H2O2 was 7.5 mM.
