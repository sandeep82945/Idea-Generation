The impact of such a shift has rarely been investigated, and limited evidence exists about students\u2019 experience in terms of effort made and time spent, especially for laboratory sessions. Assessing students\u2019 experiences will provide paramount evidence to fine-tune laboratory virtual learning sessions. Objective: To assess students\u2019 experience of virtual (online) laboratory sessions versus on-campus laboratory sessions, including preference, time spent, the effort made, ability to remember instructions, and preference for future teaching. Methods: A cross-sectional study was utilized. A Google Forms questionnaire was prepared and sent to medicine, dentistry, and nursing school students registered at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) during the 2019/2020 academic year. Selfreported preference, time spent, efforts made, ability to remember instructions and preference for future teaching were assessed for virtual versus on-campus anatomy, pathology, microbiology, histology, and physiology laboratory sessions. Results: A total of 455 students participated in this questionnaire. More students in histology (55.2%), pathology (57.4%), and microbiology (55.3%) laboratories, but not anatomy (39.6%) physiology (443.95), reported preferring virtual sessions over on-campus sessions. More students from histology (35.6%) and microbiology (37.0%) reported spending less effort than on-campus sessions. More than half of the participants agreed that virtual laboratory sessions consumed less time than on-campus sessions. Participants reported that they cannot remember the instruction given during virtual teaching compared to on-campus teaching. Differences in students\u2019 experiences were detected by gender, major, and year of study. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to change the future of healthcare education, and preparation for future crises is paramount. Effort made, time spent, ability to remember, and preference for virtual education should be considered in terms of gender, major of study, and year. These differences should also be reflected in the planning of virtual sessions for effective implementation.

This rapid transition has severely disrupted the teaching process.5 Educational institutions have encountered numerous obstacles during this drastic transition in teaching medical students.6 In addition, major concerns, such as possible technical problems, limited internet access, the inability of laboratories to instruct clinical skills, and concerns about academic performance, have limited the credibility of remote electronic exams during the transition from on-campus laboratory sessions to remote online (virtual) laboratory sessions.7\u20139\nSeveral factors were found to influence students\u2019 preference for virtual learning. A recent study at the University of Nevada explored several factors. First, learning pace, technology skills, work status, and previous online courses significantly influenced students\u2019 preferences and experiences.10 Instructor training, student training, and structured schedules were also found to influence the success of virtual learning.11 Among medical students in the United Kingdom, employing online teaching platforms to allow students to digest knowledge on their own time and then constructively discuss it with their peers effectively achieved learning outcomes.12 Another recent case-control study among physiotherapy students in Italy reported a preferable outcome of online teaching compared to face-to-face delivery of the same course.13 While these studies investigated students\u2019 preferences and experience with virtual learning in developed countries, little evidence has been generated from developing countries. This is a critical gap in evidence as healthcare educational institutions in developing and developed countries vary significantly in terms of available resources, infrastructure, and healthcare priorities. Limited resources and infrastructure (including internet access and utilization and virtual environment), more focus on basic skills, and reliance on classical instructional methods have been reported from developing countries.14 To bridge this research gap and to explore students\u2019 experience with virtual laboratory sessions, the present study aimed to assess medical, dental, and nursing students\u2019 preferences and experiences related to virtual education compared to on-campus education."

            "text": "Study Settings Healthcare education at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) encompasses a significant portion of laboratory services provided to medical, nursing, and dental students. These are provided between years one and four as part of stand-alone sessions or systems and modules. The medical school at JUST houses all these laboratories and is responsible for students\u2019 learning within practical sessions. The first semester of the academic year of 2019/2021 included on-campus practical sessions. This has shifted to online teaching/sessions as of the second semester, given the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStudy Design and Tools A cross-sectional study design was utilized. A preliminary questionnaire was created and reviewed by three faculty members at the School of Medicine at JUST. The questionnaire was further edited after initial review by a sample of medical, dentistry, and nursing students (N=10).\nThe questionnaire was distributed online via the Google Forms link and shared with students through the e-learning platform. After three and six days, a follow-up reminder was sent. The questionnaire was distributed after the second semester of the 2019/2020 academic year. The survey included 16 questions that collected students\u2019 demographics (academic major and gender), and the major part aimed to assess the students\u2019 experience of virtual (online) laboratory sessions versus on-campus laboratory sessions, including preference, time and effort spent, ability to remember instruction and preference for future teaching.\nParticipants Eligible students were those enrolled in JUST\u2019s medical, dental, and nursing specialties. An email was sent to students registered in virtual laboratory classes during the second semester of the academic year 2019/2020.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/AMEP.S425144 DovePress Advances in Medical Education and Practice 2023:14 1046\nAl Bashir et al Dovepress\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nIRB Approval Approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review board (IRB) of JUST (IRB number 13/134/2020). On the first page of the online questionnaire, participants were informed about the study\u2019s aim, objective, and right to withdraw at any point. Also, they were assured that all information would be confidential and used for research purposes only. Participation was voluntary.\nStatistical methods Data was extracted into an Excel sheet and then into SPSS version 26. Data were reported in numbers and percentages as appropriate. The chi-square test was used for statistical comparisons. The alpha level was set at 0.05 for statistical significance."

            "text": "Characteristics of Study Participants A total of 455 students from the faculty of medicine, dentistry, and nursing at Jordan University of Science and Technology agreed to participate in the survey. About half (50.1%, n=228) of the participants were females, 48.6% (n=221) were from the first-year level, while the other second, third-, and fourth-year levels were 30.8% (n=140), 19.3% (n=88), and 1.3%, respectively. Five laboratories were taken during the Spring semester of the 2019/2020 academic year, including anatomy, histology, pathology, microbiology, and physiology. The majority of students were from the faculty of medicine (83.7%, n=381), while the faculty of dentistry and nursing were 16.3% (n=74). Physiology was the major laboratory taken, with 455 students, while participants enrolled in anatomy, histology, pathology, and microbiology were 448, 436, 362, and 362 students.\nParticipants\u2019 Experience with Virtual Sessions Participants\u2019 experience in virtual sessions is presented in Table 1. Virtual laboratory sessions for histology (55.2%, n=237), pathology (57.4%, n=198), and microbiology (55.3%, n=194) were preferred over on-campus sessions (P-value <0.05 for all comparisons). In contrast, anatomy (60.4%, n=265) and physiology (56.2%, n=172) on-campus sessions were preferred over virtual sessions (P-value<0.05 for both comparisons). In all laboratories investigated, students reported that virtual laboratory session consumes less time than on-campus sessions, with 56.7% (n=244) for anatomy, 58.9% (n=246) for histology, 54.1% (n=192) for pathology, 56.2% (n=200) for microbiology, and 56.5% (n=174) for physiology (Table 1).\nStudents reported spending less effort on virtual teaching than on-campus teaching in histology (35.6%, n=155) and microbiology (37%, n=134) laboratories. Similar measures for virtual and on-campus teaching methods were reported for pathology (38.7%, n=140). However, students reported spending more effort on virtual teaching compared to on-campus teaching in anatomy (44.2%, n=198) and physiology (25.7%, n=117) laboratories (Table 1).\nThe ability to remember instructions during virtual laboratory sessions was inferior to on-campus laboratory sessions in all laboratories as 40.2% (n=159) in the anatomy laboratory, 46.4% (n=181) in the histology laboratory, 48.9% (n=153) in the pathology laboratory, 47.8% (n=150) in the microbiology, and 44.7% (n=122) in the physiology reported remembering instructions better during virtual laboratory sessions (Table 1).\nThe majority of students in histology, pathology, and microbiology laboratories reported preferring future virtual sessions, with 222 students (59.8%), 195 students (52.56%), and 184 students (49.6%), respectively. However, students in anatomy and physiology laboratories reported not preferring virtual future sessions, with 225 students (60.65%) and 149 students (40.16%), respectively (Table 1).\nDifferences by Gender, Major, and Year As shown in Table 2, significant differences in effort made and ability to remember instructions were detected by gender in various laboratories taken. In comparison to on-campus sessions, 41.1%, 41.8%, 44.6%, and 38.4% of males put in \u201cless effort\u201d in virtual histology, pathology, microbiology, and physiology laboratory sessions, respectively, while 42.2%,\nAdvances in Medical Education and Practice 2023:14 https://doi.org/10.2147/AMEP.S425144 DovePress 1047\nDovepress Al Bashir et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\n48.0%, 39.7%, and 38.5% of females put in \u201csimilar effort\u201d in virtual histology, pathology, microbiology, and physiology laboratory sessions, respectively (p-value <0.05 for all comparisons). Also, 45.2% and 52.6% of males were able to remember instructions better in anatomy and histology virtual sessions, respectively, whereas 35.5% and 40.5% of females were able to remember instructions better in anatomy, and histology virtual sessions, respectively (p-value <0.05).\nStudents were divided into two groups; the first was those in medicine college, and the second was those in dentistry and nursing college. A statistical significance (p-value <0.05) was seen in preference for virtual laboratory, time spent, and ability to remember in different laboratories. Medicine college students preferred virtual sessions in pathology and microbiology laboratories (59.6% and 57.7%, respectively) compared to dentistry, and nursing college students (38.5% and 38.1%, respectively). Meanwhile, 59.8%, 60.3%, 56.2%, and 59.2% of medicine college students spend less time with anatomy, histology, pathology, and physiology virtual laboratory sessions, respectively, in contrast to 40.0%, 48.2%, 39.5%, and 40.8% of dentistry, and nursing college students spend less time with anatomy, histology, pathology, and physiology virtual laboratory sessions, respectively.\nAs illustrated in Table 2, significant differences by the increase of the year of study were detected for preference of virtual laboratory over on-campus laboratory in histology, pathology, microbiology, and physiology, as well as for effort made in anatomy, pathology, microbiology, and physiology. Students were able to remember the instructions better for the virtual laboratory in all laboratories taken (anatomy, histology, pathology, microbiology, and physiology).\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/AMEP.S425144 DovePress Advances in Medical Education and Practice 2023:14 1048\nAl Bashir et al Dovepress\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nTable 2 Distribution of Study Participants by Preference, Time Spent, Efforts Made, and Ability to Remember and by Gender, Study Major, and Year\nGender Major Year of Study\nFemale Male P-value Dentistry, Nursing\nMedicine P-value 1 2 3 4 P-value\nNo. % No. % No. % No. % No. % No. % No. % No. %\nPreference for anatomy virtual laboratory over on-campus laboratory No 141 63.8% 125 57.1% 0.149 36 53.7% 230 61.7% 0.222 142 65.7% 78 58.2% 40 48.2% 6 85.7% 0.019 Yes 80 36.2% 94 42.9% 31 46.3% 143 38.3% 74 34.3% 56 41.8% 43 51.8% 1 14.3%\nPreference for histology virtual laboratory over on-campus laboratory No 94 43.7% 98 45.6% 0.926 30 53.6% 162 43.3% 0.150 108 51.2% 55 41.7% 26 32.5% 3 42.9% 0.031 Yes 121 56.3% 117 54.4% 26 46.4% 212 56.7% 103 48.8% 77 58.3% 54 67.5% 4 57.1%\nPreference for pathology virtual laboratory over on-campus laboratory No 78 45.3% 70 40.2% 0.336 24 61.5% 124 40.4% 0.012 81 64.3% 47 36.2% 17 20.5% 3 42.9% <0.001 Yes 94 54.7% 104 59.8% 15 38.5% 183 59.6% 45 35.7% 83 63.8% 66 79.5% 4 57.1%\nPreference for microbiology virtual laboratory over on-campus laboratory No 81 46.3% 76 42.9% 0.528 26 61.9% 131 42.3% 0.016 84 65.1% 54 40.3% 17 20.7% 2 28.6% <0.001 Yes 94 53.7% 101 57.1% 16 38.1% 179 57.7% 45 34.9% 80 59.7% 65 79.3% 5 71.4%\nPreference for physiology virtual laboratory over oncampus laboratory\nNo 91 58.3% 82 54.3% 0.477 27 60.0% 146 55.7% 0.593 74 65.5% 63 54.3% 29 40.8% 7 100.0% <0.001 Yes 65 41.7% 69 45.7% 18 40.0% 116 44.3% 39 34.5% 53 45.7% 42 59.2% 0 0.0%\nTime spent on anatomy virtual laboratory compared to on-campus laboratory\nLess 120 55.6% 124 57.7% 0.847 28 40.0% 216 59.8% 0.002 109 51.4% 84 64.1% 46 56.1% 5 83.3% 0.094 Similar 47 21.8% 47 21.9% 17 24.3% 77 21.3% 48 22.6% 23 17.6% 23 28.0% 0 0.0% More 49 22.7% 44 20.5% 25 35.7% 68 18.8% 55 25.9% 24 18.3% 13 15.9% 1 16.7%\n(Continued)\nA dvances in M edical Education and Practice 2023:14 https://doi.org/10.2147/A M EP.S425144 D ovePress\n1049\nD ovepress\nA l Bashir et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/A M EP.S425144 D ovePress\nA dvances in M edical Education and Practice 2023:14 1050\nA l Bashir et al\nD ovepress\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nEffort made on pathology virtual laboratory compared to on-campus laboratory\nLess 46 25.7% 77 41.8% <0.001 11 24.4% 112 35.2% 0.341 33 25.0% 51 37.0% 38 44.2% 1 14.3% 0.001 Similar 86 48.0% 54 29.3% 19 42.2% 121 38.1% 47 35.6% 53 38.4% 35 40.7% 5 71.4% More 47 26.3% 53 28.8% 15 33.3% 85 26.7% 52 39.4% 34 24.6% 13 15.1% 1 14.3%\nEffort made on microbiology virtual laboratory compared to on-campus laboratory\nLess 52 29.1% 82 44.6% 0.007 13 28.9% 121 38.1% 0.490 41 30.8% 51 37.0% 41 48.2% 1 14.3% 0.003 Similar 71 39.7% 52 28.3% 17 37.8% 106 33.3% 39 29.3% 49 35.5% 30 35.3% 5 71.4% More 56 31.3% 50 27.2% 15 33.3% 91 28.6% 53 39.8% 38 27.5% 14 16.5% 1 14.3%\nEffort made on physiology virtual laboratory compared to on-campus laboratory\nLess 41 26.3% 61 38.4% 0.004 11 21.2% 91 34.6% 0.024 27 23.7% 46 37.4% 29 40.3% 0 0.0% <0.001 Similar 60 38.5% 35 22.0% 13 25.0% 82 31.2% 29 25.4% 38 30.9% 23 31.9% 5 83.3% More 55 35.3% 63 39.6% 28 53.8% 90 34.2% 58 50.9% 39 31.7% 20 27.8% 1 16.7%\nStudents\u2019 ability to remember instruction better in anatomy virtual laboratory No 129 64.5% 108 54.8% 0.049 40 59.7% 197 59.7% 0.999 135 67.8% 70 55.6% 31 44.9% 1 33.3% 0.004 Yes 71 35.5% 89 45.2% 27 40.3% 133 40.3% 64 32.2% 56 44.4% 38 55.1% 2 66.7%\nStudents\u2019 ability to remember instruction better in histology virtual laboratory No 116 59.5% 93 47.4% 0.017 31 59.6% 178 52.5% 0.339 121 61.1% 64 52.9% 23 33.8% 1 25.0% <0.001 Yes 79 40.5% 103 52.6% 21 40.4% 161 47.5% 77 38.9% 57 47.1% 45 66.2% 3 75.0%\nStudents\u2019 ability to remember instruction better in pathology virtual laboratory No 83 53.5% 77 48.4% 0.364 24 57.1% 136 50.0% 0.389 77 68.1% 63 50.8% 19 26.0% 1 25.0% <0.001 Yes 72 46.5% 82 51.6% 18 42.9% 136 50.0% 36 31.9% 61 49.2% 54 74.0% 3 75.0%\nStudents\u2019 ability to remember instruction better in microbiology virtual laboratory No 84 55.3% 80 49.1% 0.272 22 55.0% 142 51.6% 0.691 82 68.9% 64 52.5% 17 24.3% 1 25.0% <0.001 Yes 68 44.7% 83 50.9% 18 45.0% 133 48.4% 37 31.1% 58 47.5% 53 75.7% 3 75.0%\nStudents\u2019 ability to remember instruction better in physiology virtual laboratory No 77 57.5% 74 52.9% 0.444 27 55.1% 124 55.1% 0.999 70 71.4% 59 52.2% 21 36.2% 1 20.0% <0.001 Yes 57 42.5% 66 47.1% 22 44.9% 101 44.9% 28 28.6% 54 47.8% 37 63.8% 4 80.0%\nA dvances in M edical Education and Practice 2023:14 https://doi.org/10.2147/A M EP.S425144 D ovePress\n1051\nD ovepress\nA l Bashir et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic and associated non-pharmaceutical interventions changed education delivery methodologies. With the presence of modern technology, the opportunity for the swift switch to virtual teaching techniques was provided, and virtual courses were offered in the majority of health-related specialties. Still, little is known about students\u2019 experiences from within developing countries. This study explored students\u2019 experience related to virtual learning methods within laboratory settings compared to the usual on-campus teaching modality, inferring key recommendations to build inclusive virtual curricula. The results indicate that while there is a preference for using virtual sessions, differences in experiences must be addressed by gender, year, and major of study. This area needs further investigation to fine-tune students\u2019 experiences with virtual sessions better.\nAbout half of the study participants preferred virtual delivery methods over on-campus ones. Similarly, about half preferred to have virtual sessions in the future. Based on these findings, comparable satisfaction with the virtual learning experience can be suggested. This finding agrees with previous reports from China documenting high satisfaction rates of virtual education.15 Studies from our region showed lower satisfaction rates, with only 30% of students satisfied with the online learning experience.16 Multiple factors could be accounted for in determining the overall satisfaction with virtual learning. Among the positives, commuting time, learning at one\u2019s own pace, learning from the convenience of the household, and availability of all relevant material were reported.16 In the meantime, low-quality internet connectivity, tutors\u2019 internet literacy, the platform, its design, and the ability to enhance interaction could be among the main restraints to online learning.17 In a scoping review, several factors were determined as facilitators and barriers to intervention effectiveness, including pedagogical background, course design, students\u2019 profiles, and methodology of delivery.18 The platform\u2019s role was emphasized earlier, and students\u2019 satisfaction was related to page appearance, navigation potentials, online applications, and interactive environment.19 Given the newer generations\u2019 awareness of digital platforms, investigating digital health competencies and attitudes could help shape the future of virtual learning, moving the reliance from computer-dependent learning to the use of multiple modalities, including tablets and smartphones.20 Finally, the findings highlight the need to holistically address virtual learning, making the most of advanced technology, and proper planning since the recent experience was mandatory and forced by the pandemic.\nAmong the five subjects of concern, three, pathology, microbiology, and histology, were preferred when given virtually. This could be due to the nature of the provided material, but the determinant of this association is not well understood and warrants further investigations. Another previously studied variant that impacts the preference of virtual and on-campus teaching methods is the interactions, whether it is student-instructor or student-student. Traditional face-to-face teaching has always been preferred to increase engagement and provoke interactions.21 Nonetheless, other factors may impact this satisfaction, including the psychological impacts of COVID-19 and the technology used to improve interactions.22\nIt is worth mentioning that the understanding of the teaching material was less with virtual sessions in all five laboratories. Despite that, the virtual sessions yielded a comparable knowledge of some topics, which could indicate that some topics can be shifted into virtual or hybrid teaching in the future, granting holistic and careful, attentive planning. Moreover, enhancing virtual teaching platforms could help in pandemic preparedness, which will equip our educational system with the need to improve remote teaching in similar circumstances.\nThis study has limitations. At first, the sample is not generalizable to all healthcare students, even in Jordan, as the data was collected from students at one university. As well, the online survey does not provide a representative sample. Accordingly, more research should be utilized using cross-country samples and a more random sampling approach. The number of medical students and participants from the first years of study was predominant. As such, this is a threat to internal and external validity. More qualitative studies should focus on understanding gender differences regarding efforts made and time spent."
