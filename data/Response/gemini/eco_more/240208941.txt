1. **Develop a spatial RD estimation based on newly developed asymptotic results of Kurisu and Matsuda (2023).** This would allow for the estimation of treatment effects in RD designs with spatial data, which is currently not possible with existing methods.
2. **Investigate the practical performance of estimators with more than two dimensions.** This would help to determine the feasibility of using our approach for RD designs with higher-dimensional running variables.
3. **Develop a new approach to exploiting the higher-order bias expressions for our multivariate local-polynomial estimates.** This would allow for more accurate bias correction and improved estimation results.
4. **Incorporate covariates into the estimation procedures in RD designs.** This would allow for the estimation of treatment effects while controlling for other factors that may affect the outcome of interest.
5. **Develop a procedure to aggregate heterogeneous estimates over the set of boundary points.** This would allow for the estimation of an average treatment effect across the entire boundary, rather than just at individual points.
