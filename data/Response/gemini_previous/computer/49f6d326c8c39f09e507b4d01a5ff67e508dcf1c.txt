1. **Investigate the relationship between coronal hole evolution and solar cycle phases:** 
Study how the size, shape, and location of coronal holes vary throughout different phases of the solar cycle. This could help improve predictions of space weather events during different solar cycle phases.


2. **Explore the impact of coronal holes on the formation and propagation of solar wind streams:** 
Investigate how the characteristics of coronal holes influence the properties of solar wind streams, such as their speed, density, and temperature. This could help improve understanding of the relationship between coronal holes and space weather events.


3. **Develop machine learning models for predicting coronal hole eruptions:** 
Use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in coronal hole data that can be used to predict when and where coronal holes are likely to erupt. This could help improve the accuracy and lead time of space weather forecasts.


4. **Study the interaction between coronal holes and other solar phenomena:** 
Investigate how coronal holes interact with other solar phenomena, such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and sunspots. This could help improve understanding of the complex dynamics of the solar atmosphere and their impact on space weather.


5. **Develop a comprehensive space weather forecasting system:** 
Integrate coronal hole data with other solar and geophysical data to develop a comprehensive space weather forecasting system. This system could provide real-time alerts and predictions of space weather events, helping to protect critical infrastructure and human activities from the effects of space weather.
