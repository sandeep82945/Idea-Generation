Clinical Trials of LicA and LicB in T2DM Patients: Building on the in vitro and in silico evidence of DPP-4 inhibition by LicA and LicB, the next step could involve conducting clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and dosage of LicA and LicB in individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This would involve assessing the compounds' effects on blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and potential side effects in human subjects.

Exploring Synergistic Effects with Existing T2DM Medications: Investigate the potential synergistic effects of LicA and LicB with currently approved T2DM medications. This research could identify whether combining these natural compounds with existing drugs enhances therapeutic outcomes or reduces side effects, potentially leading to new combination therapies.

Long-term Effects and Mechanisms of Action Study: While the initial study provides a promising outlook on the acute inhibition of DPP-4 by LicA and LicB, long-term studies are necessary to understand the sustainability of these effects and any long-term benefits or risks. Additionally, exploring the detailed mechanisms through which these compounds interact with DPP-4 and other components of the glucose metabolism pathway could uncover new insights into T2DM management.

Identification and Characterization of Other Bioactive Compounds in Glycyrrhiza uralensis: The study highlights the potential of Glycyrrhiza uralensis in managing T2DM. Future research could focus on identifying, isolating, and characterizing other bioactive compounds within this plant that may contribute to its antidiabetic effects, potentially leading to the discovery of new therapeutic agents.

Assessing the Impact on Diabetes-related Complications: Investigate whether LicA, LicB, or other compounds from Glycyrrhiza uralensis can not only manage blood glucose levels but also prevent or mitigate diabetes-related complications, such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular diseases. This could involve both in vitro and in vivo studies to explore their effects on markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular health in the context of diabetes.
