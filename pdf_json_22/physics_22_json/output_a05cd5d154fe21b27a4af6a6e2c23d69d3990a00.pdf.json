Using an improved Langevin model coupled to a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model, we study the nuclear modification factor (RAA), directed flow (v1) and elliptic flow (v2) coefficients of heavy mesons and their decayed electrons at the RHIC energy. We find that the counter-clockwise tilt of the nuclear matter in the reaction plane results in a positive (negative) heavy flavor v1 in the backward (forward) rapidity region, whose magnitude increases with the heavy quark transverse momentum. The difference in the heavy flavor RAA between different angular regions is also proposed as a complementary tool to characterize the asymmetry of the medium profile. Our model results are consistent with currently available data at RHIC and provide predictions that can be tested by future measurements.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nHeavy-ion collision experiments conducted at the BNL Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provide a unique opportunity to study the color deconfined state of nuclear matter, known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. Heavy quarks serve as a clean probe that reveals the QGP properties at different energy scales [2, 3]. Due to the large mass of heavy quarks, they are mainly produced from the very early hard scatterings of high-energy nuclear collisions, prior to the formation of the QGP. Then they propagate through the medium and observe the entire evolution history of the QGP before they hadronize. Therefore, the difference in heavy flavor observables between proton-proton (p+p) and nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions characterizes the transport properties of the QGP [4, 5].\nConsiderable efforts have been devoted in developing transport models of heavy quarks in order to understand their dynamics inside a hot nuclear matter. It is now generally accepted that at high transverse momentum (pT), perturbative calculations that involve both elastic and inelastic scatterings between heavy quarks and the QGP provide a successful description of the nuclear modification factor (RAA) of heavy flavor hadrons [6\u201312]. At intermediate pT, a combination of fragmentation and coalescence mechanisms is essential in understanding the hadronization process of heavy quarks thus describing the heavy flavor hadron chemistry observed at RHIC and LHC [13\u201316]. At low pT, modeling the non-perturbative scatterings between heavy quarks and the medium becomes inevitable in order to understand their strong interactions, as revealed by the large elliptic flow co-\n\u2217Electronic address: jiangzf@mails.ccnu.edu.cn \u2020Electronic address: shanshan.cao@sdu.edu.cn\nefficients of D mesons [17\u201321]. In addition to RAA and v2, novel observables have also been proposed to place more stringent constraints on the heavy quark dynamics inside the QGP, such as the momentum imbalance and angular correlation between heavy meson pairs [22, 23], correlation of the higher-order harmonic flow coefficients between heavy and light flavor hadrons [24], and inner structures of heavy-flavor tagged jets [25, 26].\nThe directed flow coefficient (v1) of heavy quarks is another observable of great interest due to the copious information of the medium properties it encodes. It was proposed that due to the asymmetric distribution of the nuclear matter along the longitudinal direction, the heavy meson v1 could be more than an order of magnitude larger than that of the light flavor hadrons emitted from the QGP [27\u201329]. This has soon been confirmed by the STAR measurement [30] and attracted many further studies [31\u201333] that couple various transport models to a tilted QGP fireball in the reaction plane [34]. Meanwhile, the splitting of v1 (\u2206v1) between heavy quarks and their antiparticles is also considered an effective tool to probe the extremely strong electromagnetic field generated by non-central heavy-ion collisions because of the opposite Lorentz force exerted on them [27, 28, 31, 33, 35, 36]. Interestingly, while a decreasing v1 with respect to rapidity (y) is observed for both D0 and D\u03040 at STAR [30], with small difference between them, apparent splitting of v1 is seen by ALICE [37], with D0 increasing but D\u03040 decreasing with respect to pseudorapidity (\u03b7). This puzzling observation implies the competing effects between the longitudinally tilted medium geometry and the electromagnetic field on the heavy flavor v1 at RHIC and LHC.\nIn our previous study [33], it has been found that while the formation of heavy flavor v1 is dominated by the deformed medium profile at the RHIC energy, it is mainly determined by the electromagnetic field at LHC. As a follow-up study, we will focus on the 200 AGeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC in the present work and conduct a systematic exploration on how\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n04 14\n3v 2\n[ nu\ncl -t\nh] 1\n2 Se\np 20\n22\n2 heavy quarks can be utilized to probe the initial energy density distribution of the QGP. In addition to D mesons, RAA, v1 and v2 will also be calculated for B mesons and their decayed electrons. We will study the transverse momentum dependence of the heavy flavor v1, and extract the slope parameter of the v1(y) function, which can be tested by future more precise measurements and help quantify the tilt of the QGP in its initial state. Last but not least, the difference in the heavy flavor RAA between different angular regions will also be investigated as an alternative tool to characterize the asymmetry of the medium along different directions.\nThis paper will be organized as follows. In Sec. II, we will provide a brief overview of our model setup, including a tilted initial condition of the bulk medium with respect to the longitudinal direction and its evolution via the CLVisc hydrodynamic model in Sec. II A, and a modified Langevin approach that describes the heavy quark interaction with the QGP in Sec. II B. In Sec. III we will present our numerical results on the heavy flavor RAA, v1 and v2, and study how they depend on the heavy quark mass, transverse momentum and medium geometry. In the end, we summarize and discuss future developments in Sec. IV."

In addition, at the end of Eq. (1), an envelope function in the Gaussian form is used to describe the plateau structure of the hadron yield observed at mid-rapidity, in which \u03b7w is the width of the central rapidity plateau and \u03c3\u03b7 controls the speed of decay away from the plateau region [39]. In Tab. I, we summarize all related model parameters introduced above. These values have been adjusted in Ref. [43] for a satisfactory description of the light hadron yield dNch/d\u03b7 and their directed flow coefficient v1 measured at RHIC and LHC.\n3 The initial fluid velocity is assumed to follow the Bjorken approximation, where vx = vy = 0 and vz = z/t [42]. The initial transverse expansion and the asymmetric distribution of vz along the impact parameter (x) direction are neglected in the present study, though the latter will become crucial when discussing the development of global polarization in heavyion collisions [45].\nWith these setups, we present the 3-dimensional profile of the nuclear matter at the initial time of hydrodynamic evolution \u03c40 = 0.6 fm/c in Fig. 1, the upper panel for the side view (\u03b7s-x plane) of the energy density distribution, and the lower panel for the top view (x-y plane) of the temperature distribution. In the figure, a clear counter-clockwise tilt of the medium in the \u03b7s-x with respect to the longitudinal direction (\u03b7s) can be seen, which was shown to be essential for understanding the non-zero directed flow of soft hadrons emitted from the QGP [43]. On the other hand, since heavy quarks are produced in the initial hard scatterings of nuclear collisions, they are expected to distribute symmetrically around the center (0, 0) of the overlapping region between the two colliding nuclei. As a result, they propagate through different path length, thus suffer different amount of energy loss, towards different directions at finite rapidity. For instance, at forward rapidity (y > 0), heavy quarks traverse longer path length towards +x (right) than \u2212x (left), resulting in a negative xcomponent of the average heavy quark momentum (\u3008px\u3009) in the end.\nWith the tilted initial condition above, we use the CLVisc hydrodynamic model to evolve the QGP profile. The hydrodynamic equation reads\n\u2202\u00b5T \u00b5\u03bd = 0, (3)\nwhere the energy-momentum tensor T\u00b5\u03bd is given by\nT\u00b5\u03bd = \u03b5u\u00b5u\u03bd \u2212 (P + \u03a0)\u2206\u00b5\u03bd + \u03c0\u00b5\u03bd , (4)\nwith \u03b5 being the local energy density, u\u00b5 being the fluid four velocity, P being the pressure, \u03a0 being the bulk viscosity pressure and \u03c0\u00b5\u03bd being the shear viscosity tensor. In addition, \u2206\u00b5\u03bd = g\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 u\u00b5u\u03bd is the projection operator with the metric tensor g\u00b5\u03bd = diag(1,\u22121,\u22121,\u22121). In this study, the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density-ratio is set as \u03b7v/s = 0.08 (\u03b7v for the shear viscosity), while the bulk viscosity and the net baryon density are ignored. The equation of state (EoS) is taken from the Wuppertal-Budapest work [46]. After hydrodynamic evolution, the QGP medium is converted to light flavor hadrons according to the Cooper-Frye mechanism with the isothermal freeze-out condition determined by a constant temperature Tfrz = 137 MeV. These setups allow a reasonable description of the soft hadron spectra and their directed and elliptic flow coefficients observed at RHIC and LHC [39, 42, 43]."

            "text": "The interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP medium is described using our modified Langevin ap-\nproach [9, 47] that includes both elastic and inelastic scattering processes. The modified Langevin equation reads\nd~p dt = \u2212\u03b7D(~p)~p+ ~\u03be + ~fg, (5)\nwhere \u2212\u03b7D(~p)~p provides the drag force and ~\u03be gives the thermal random force on heavy quarks inside a thermal medium. The third term ~fg is introduced to describe the recoil force experienced by heavy quarks when they emit medium-induced gluons.\nFor quasielastic scatterings, we assume that ~\u03be is independent of momentum (~p) in the present work. Its strength is determined by the white noise \u2329 \u03bei(t)\u03bej(t\u2032) \u232a = \u03ba\u03b4ij\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032) where \u03ba is the momentum space diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks. Here \u03ba is further related to the drag coefficient via the fluctuation-dissipation relation \u03b7D(p) = \u03ba/(2TE), with T and E being the medium temperature and the heavy quark energy respectively. The spatial diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks can then be extracted as Ds \u2261 T/[M\u03b7D(0)] = 2T 2/\u03ba in which M is the heavy quark mass. This Ds will be treated as the only model parameter for our modified Langevin approach [23, 47]. For a minimal model, a constant value of Ds(2\u03c0T ) is used in this work, which is determined by the RAA of heavy mesons and their decayed electrons, as will be shown in the next section. A more elaborate dynamical calculation of this diffusion coefficient has been developed in our recent work based on a non-perturbative potential scattering approach [21], which can also be implemented in this Langevin model in our future study.\nThe recoil force in Eq. (5) is given by ~fg = \u2212d~pg/dt, where ~pg denotes the momentum of medium-induced gluons, whose spectrum can be taken from the higher-twist energy loss calculation [48\u201350]. The strength of this term is characterized by the jet quenching parameter q\u0302, which can be directly related to the momentum space diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks via a dimension factor \u2013 q\u0302 = 2\u03ba [9] \u2013 and is further connected to the Ds parameter as discussed earlier.\nFor heavy quark production and evolution in realistic heavy-ion collisions, we initialize the spatial distributions of heavy quarks using the Monte-Carlo Glauber model, and their momentum spectra using the Fixed-Order-Next-to-LeadingLog (FONLL) perturbative QCD calculation [51\u201353] that includes both pair production and flavor excitation processes. In this study, the FONLL calculation is coupled to the CT14NLO parton distribution function (PDF) [54] and the EPPS16 parametrization [55] of nuclei to take into account the nuclear shadowing effect in heavy-ion collisions. We assume the interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP start from the initial time (\u03c40 = 0.6 fm/c) of the hydrodynamic evolution of the nuclear matter. During the QGP stage, the energymomentum of heavy quarks are updated according to Eq. (5) in the local rest frame of the QGP. The local temperature and flow velocity information of the QGP are provided by the CLVisc hydrodynamic model as described in the previous subsection. When heavy quarks travel across the QGP boundary, defined by a hypersurface at a fixed decoupling temperature Td = 165 MeV in this work, they are converted to heavy flavor hadrons via a hybrid fragmentation and coalescence\n4 model [16] that is well constrained by the heavy flavor hadron chemistry measured at RHIC and LHC. Finally, the heavy flavor hadrons decay into electrons via Pythia simulation [56]. For a summary on the systematic uncertainties contributed by various ingredients of our model, one may refer to Ref. [57]."

In the above equations, \u03a81 and \u03a82 represent the first-order and the second-order event plane angles and \u3008...\u3009 denotes average over both the final-state particles and different collision events. Since we use the modified optical Glauber model to calculate the initial energy density distribution of the QGP (as described in Sec. II), the eventby-event fluctuations have not been taken into account in this work [23, 33]. Therefore, the event plane in the final state is the same as the participant plane in the initial state and also the spectator plane that can be measured from the deflected neutrons in experiments [33].\nA. RAA, v1 and v2 of heavy mesons\nWe start with the nuclear modification factor, elliptic and directed flow coefficients of heavy mesons in 200 AGeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 2, we present theRAA ofD andB mesons in 0-10% Au+Au collisions in the mid-rapidity region (|y| < 1). Using a spatial diffusion coefficient Ds(2\u03c0T ) = 4 for c-quarks, our calculation provides a reasonable description of the D meson RAA measured by STAR [58, 60].

As discussed in the previous section, Ds(2\u03c0T ) is treated as a model parameter here, whose detailed dependence on the heavy quark mass will be explored in a separate study soon. The peak structures of the D and B meson RAA arise from the coalescence process that combines low pT heavy and thermal light partons into medium pT hadrons [9]. Above the peak region (pT & 2.5 GeV), B mesons exhibit a larger RAA than D mesons due to weaker energy loss of heavier partons through the QGP.\nIn the middle panel of Fig. 2, we present the elliptic flow v2 of D and B mesons in 10-40% Au+Au collisions as a function of pT at mid-rapidity (|y| < 1). Within the Langevin\n5 model using a constant Ds(2\u03c0T ) value, our calculation underestimates the D meson v2 at its peak value (pT between 2 and 4 GeV) measured by STAR [59, 60]. This indicates non-trivial dependences of the diffusion coefficient on the heavy quark momentum and the medium temperature, and can be improved with a more delicate calculation of the nonperturbative interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP at low pT [21]. Here we also present the v2 of B mesons, which is non-zero but much smaller than that of theDmesons. This is consistent with the findings observed in theirRAA, suggesting weaker energy loss of b-quarks than c-quarks due to the larger mass of the former.\nWith the same diffusion coefficients used above, we present the rapidity dependence of the D meson v1 and predict the B meson v1 in 10-80% Au+Au collisions in the lower panel of Fig. 2. Our calculation qualitatively describes the trend of the D meson v1 observed at STAR [30]. We see that both D and B mesons exhibit negative slopes of v1 with respect to rapidity, due to the longer (shorter) path length of heavy quarks along the +x-direction than the \u2212x-direction in the positive (negative) rapidity region, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This is a direct feature from a tilted QGP fireball. Since b-quarks are heavier than c-quarks, the unbalanced energy loss of bquarks is smaller than that of c quarks between + and \u2212x directions, resulting in a smaller slope of the B meson v1 than the D meson v1. The slope parameters we extract around the y = \u00b11 regions are dv1/dy = \u22120.045\u00b1 0.005 for D mesons and dv1/dy = \u22120.010\u00b1 0.002 for B mesons.\nB. RAA, v1 and v2 of heavy flavor decayed electrons\nThe Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) at RHIC-STAR is able to measure single electrons from charm and beauty semileptonic decays [62], providing a complementary tool to investigate properties of heavy quarks with particular species, considering the challenges in reconstructing D and B mesons in experiments. In this subsection, we present model calculations on the RAA, v1 and v2 of charm and beauty decayed electrons, and study how they depend on the medium geometry.\nWe start with the nuclear modification factors of c and bdecayed electrons at mid-rapidity in the upper panel of Fig. 3. With the same diffusion coefficients as we used in the previous subsection for heavy mesons (D0 andB0), our model calculation provides a reasonable description of c and b-decayed electron RAA observed by STAR [61] in 0-80% Au+Au collisions at \u221a sNN = 200 GeV. Note that although the flavor (or mass) hierarchy of parton energy loss is not obvious at high pT [11], a clear difference between the charm and beauty quark energy loss can be observed here in the kinematic region focused by the RHIC experiment.\nAfter fixing the diffusion coefficients with the heavy flavor RAA, we calculate their v2 in the middle panel of Fig. 3. Our model results of both v2(e\u2190 c)(pT) and v2(e\u2190 b)(pT) are in good agreement with the STAR measurement [61] for 0-80% Au+Au collisions.

This could be viewed as an alternative signal of the longitudinal tilted fireball produced at the RHIC energy. At lower pT (. 4 GeV), the heavy meson RAA is also strongly affected by the coalescence process that is sensitive to the radial flow of the QGP, thus may not directly reflect the energy loss asymmetry of heavy quarks towards different directions.\nTo better illustrate the heavy flavor RAA in different angular regions, we present the ratio between RAA(left) and RAA(right) in the lower panel of Fig. 6.

Effects from a longitudinally tilted bulk medium on these observables have been explored within a modified Langevin transport model coupled to a (3+1)-D viscous hydrodynamic model CLVisc.\nWithin this framework, our calculation provides a reasonable description of the RAA, v1 and v2 of heavy mesons and their decayed electrons compared to data currently available at RHIC. A clear mass hierarchy of parton energy loss can be observed within the pT range focused by RHIC experiments, where D mesons exhibit smaller RAA but larger v1 and v2 than those ofB mesons. The same hierarchy remains between charm and beauty decayed electrons. We have demonstrated that v1 and the angular-dependent RAA of heavy mesons and their decayed electrons encode information of the initial longitudinal deformation of the QGP energy distribution. An initially counter-clockwise tilted QGP fireball in the \u03b7s-x plane results in a positive (negative) v1 of heavy quarks in the backward (forward) rapidity regions. In addition, at high pT, a smaller heavy flavor RAA in the +x (right) hemisphere than in \u2212x (left) is proposed at forward rapidity, which serves as an alternative observable to help constrain the 3D geometry of the QGP profile. The opposite conclusion is expected at backward rapidity. Furthermore, dependence of the directed flow on the heavy flavor pT has been studied in this work at the RHIC energy. As pT increases, heavy quarks become less thermalized and their observables are more dominated by their energy loss through the QGP. Within the kinematic range we have explored in this work, the heavy flavor v1 increases as a higher pT region is applied. Our conclusions here consistently hold across D and B mesons and their decayed electrons, and await test from future experimental observations.\nWhile this work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of how the heavy flavor probes can be utilized to constrain the initial geometry of the nuclear matter, it can be further extended in several directions. For instance, the recent isobar experiments at RHIC provide a novel environment to study the properties of QGP produced by colliding nuclei with the same number of nucleons but different geometries [69\u2013 72]. It would be interesting to investigate whether this difference in nuclear structure can also be probed using heavy flavor observables within our framework. In addition, although the effect of the electromagnetic field on heavy quarks is weak at the RHIC energy, it becomes a dominating factor generating the heavy flavor v1 at the LHC energy [33]. However, it still remains a challenge to establish an ideal spacetime evolution profile of the electromagnetic field for a precise description of the heavy meson v1 observed at LHC [28, 31, 35, 73]. These will be explored in our follow-up efforts."
