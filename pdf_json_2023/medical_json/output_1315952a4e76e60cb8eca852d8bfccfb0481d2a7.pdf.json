    "abstractText": "In wild vertebrates, the increase of breeding success with advancing age has been extensively studied through laying date, clutch size, hatching success, and fledging success. However, to better evaluate the influence of age on reproductive performance in species with high reproductive success, assessing not only reproductive success but also other proxies of reproductive performance appear crucial. For example, the quality of developmental conditions and offspring phenotype can provide robust and complementary information on reproductive performance. In long-lived vertebrate species, several proxies of developmental conditions can be used to estimate the quality of the produced offspring (i.e., body size, body condition, corticosterone levels, and telomere length), and therefore, their probability to survive. By sampling chicks reared by known-aged mothers, we investigated the influence of maternal age on reproductive performance and offspring quality in a long-lived bird species, the snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea). Older females bred and left their chick alone earlier. Moreover, older females had larger chicks that grew faster, and ultimately, those chicks had a higher survival probability at the nest. In addition, older mothers produced chicks with a higher sensitivity to stress, as shown by moderately higher stress-induced corticosterone levels. Overall, our study demonstrated that maternal age is correlated to reproductive performance (hatching date, duration of the guarding period and survival) and offspring quality (body size, growth rate and sensitivity to stress), suggesting that older individuals provide better parental cares to their offspring. These results also demonstrate that maternal age can affect the offspring phenotype with potential long-term consequences.",

            "text": "In vertebrates, age has a strong influence on individual reproductive performance (Clutton-Brock 1988; Forslund and P\u00e4rt 1995). Breeding success usually increases with advancing age up to a point before senescence occurs (Nussey et\u00a0al. 2013). Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the age-related improvement of reproductive performance (such as the selection, restraint and constraint hypotheses, Williams 1966; Curio 1983; Forslund and P\u00e4rt 1995). In birds, an extensive body of literature has focused on laying date, clutch size, hatching success, and fledging success to investigate this age-related improvement of reproductive performance (Pugesek 1983; Cameron et\u00a0al. 2000; Mauck et\u00a0al. 2004; Beamonte-Barrientos et\u00a0al. 2010; Fay et\u00a0al. 2018; Ivimey-Cook and Moorad 2020; Saraux and Chiaradia 2021). However, most of these studies have failed to measure the condition of the offspring before fledging, mostly due to the constraints associated with the study systems. However, offspring quality could be a robust and relevant additional proxy of parental reproductive performance (Barks and Laird 2020; Barreaux et\u00a0al. 2022 but see, for instance, Bouwhuis et\u00a0al. 2015; Schroeder et\u00a0al. 2015), especially because it correlates with the probably of postfledging survival. Indeed, there is now increasing evidence that only a small percentage of fledglings will subsequently survive and significantly contribute to future generations through the production of offspring (McCleery et\u00a0al. 2008; Wilson and Nussey 2010; Cam et\u00a0al. 2013; Fay et\u00a0al. 2016, 2018; Vedder and Bouwhuis 2018).\nJuveniles are inexperienced, less able to acquire food (Desrochers 1992) and to sustain detrimental conditions (e.g., low food availability, Wiens et\u00a0 al. 2006). Consequently, many often disappear from the population before any breeding attempt (e.g., Alderman et\u00a0al. 2010; Fay et\u00a0al. 2015; Naef-Daenzer and Gr\u00fcebler 2016). In addition, among juveniles that survive until adulthood, their phenotype may constrain them and reduce their probability to successfully breed later in life (e.g., van de Pol et\u00a0al. 2006). This high individual heterogeneity in performance among individuals is often related to organismal systems (e.g., morphology, behaviour, and physiology), which are at least partly determined during their development (Lindstr\u00f6m 1999; Monaghan 2008; Cam and Aubry 2011; Maness and Anderson 2013; Hamel et\u00a0al. 2018). In that context, assessing not only reproductive success but also the quality of the offspring appears crucial to better evaluate the influence of age on reproductive performance.\nWhen investigating the influence of age on reproductive performance in birds, several components need therefore to be evaluated. Firstly, phenology, parental effort and fledging success are needed to obtain robust estimates of the ability of parents to successfully breed and rear their chick (CluttonBrock 1988; Newton 1989; Forslund and P\u00e4rt 1995; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2015). Specifically, high parental skills and investment are often related to early breeding, and consequently, high fledging success, especially in seabird species (Bogdanova et\u00a0al. 2007; Angelier et\u00a0al. 2007b; Rebke et\u00a0al. 2010; Sauser et\u00a0al. 2021). Secondly, several proxies of developmental conditions can be used to assess the quality of the offspring, and therefore, their probability to survive and to recruit into the population (Cam and Aubry 2011; Mumme et\u00a0al. 2015). Notably, several \u201ckey\u201d morphological, physiological, and behavioural systems are important during the developmental period to assess offspring quality (Schoech et\u00a0al. 2011) and to study the relationship between parental age, developmental constraints and offspring quality.\nSlower growth, smaller body size, and lower body condition are usually associated with higher developmental constraints, and with lower subsequent performance (e.g., postfledging survival probability; Morrison et\u00a0al. 2009; Jones et\u00a0al. 2017; Vernasco et\u00a0al. 2018; Sauser et\u00a0al. 2018; Evans et\u00a0al. 2020). Additionally, organismal-related stress systems are set up during the developmental period, and they are known to determine, at least partly, the ability of individuals to breed and survive when environmental stressors occur (Angelier and Wingfield 2013).\nPhysiological proxies of stress levels are considered as robust tools to assess not only the constraint that may occur during the developmental period, but also the probability of fledglings to subsequently survive and recruit into the population. When facing a threatening event, corticosterone secretion increases to mobilize energy (e.g., protein catabolism, Sapolsky et\u00a0al. 2000; Romero 2004) and to promote an emergency response that aims to restore homeostasis and helps the chick surviving the acute stressor (Angelier and Wingfield 2013; Wingfield 2013). In chicks, developmental conditions are associated with short- and long-term modifications of physiological stress sensitivity (Rensel and Schoech 2011; Zimmer et\u00a0al. 2013; Grace et\u00a0al. 2017, 2020; Kraft et\u00a0al. 2019). This stress sensitivity can in turn be related to post-hatching survival and even post-fledging performances (e.g., Harvey et\u00a0al. 2006; Blas et\u00a0al. 2007; Breuner et\u00a0al. 2008; Love et\u00a0al. 2013).\nFinally, short telomere length has been proposed as a relevant proxy of constraining early-life environmental\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply. Rights reserved.\n65Oecologia (2023) 203:63\u201378\n1 3\nconditions and of poor fledgling quality. Telomeres are terminal chromosomal complexes composed of highly repeated DNA sequences and proteins. Their length is reduced during each cell division due to the incomplete end-replication (Blackburn 2005). Interestingly, the occurrence of environmental or nutritional constraints at the early stage seems to accelerate this telomere attrition (Monaghan 2014; Angelier et\u00a0al. 2018; Noguera and Velando 2019; Stier et\u00a0al. 2020), and parental age could translate into short telomeres if associated with low quality parental cares (e.g., Dupont et\u00a0al. 2018). This developmental telomere attrition has been already convincingly associated with reduced longevity and fitness in captive and wild animals (Heidinger et\u00a0al. 2012; Asghar et\u00a0al. 2015; Wilbourn et\u00a0al. 2018; Eastwood et\u00a0al. 2019; Heidinger et\u00a0al. 2021) and seems to have potential long-lasting fitness consequences (Marasco et\u00a0al. 2022).\nIn this study, we investigated the influence of maternal age on reproductive performance and offspring quality in the snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea), a long-lived seabird species (average lifespan: ~ 50\u00a0years old, Chastel et\u00a0al. 1993). In this species, increasing parental age is associated with better breeding performance and reproductive senescence does not occur before very old ages (Angelier et\u00a0al. 2007a; Berman et\u00a0al. 2009).We specifically focused on maternal age because known-aged females were more abundant in our study site and because females may have a greater impact on offspring quality than males in this seabird species (Barbraud and Chastel 1999; Barbraud et\u00a0al. 1999). Breeding pairs produce at most a single chick per breeding season, making this species a perfect model to study the influence of age on breeding success and offspring phenotype independently of sibling competition. We followed 56 knownaged females (from 8 to 34\u00a0years old, which correspond to young and middle-age classes for this species, Angelier et\u00a0al. 2007a; Berman et\u00a0al. 2009) and their chicks and we specifically monitored their reproductive phenology (hatching date), the duration of the guarding period (a component of parental care), and offspring survival at the nest. We also assessed the influence of maternal age on the quality of developmental conditions through morphological (growth, body size and body condition), physiological (corticosterone), and molecular (telomere length) variables. Because no senescent females were monitored, we expected a linear rather than a quadratic relationship between maternal age and measured reproductive outputs. Specifically, we predict that reproductive performance will improve with advancing maternal age. More precisely, we predict that younger snow petrels should lay later as later breeding is usually related to poor reproductive performance (prediction 1). Because the guarding period is supposed to be longer when the chicks grow slowly, we also predict that younger petrels will guard their chick longer if they are less able to feed their chick and sustain its growth (prediction 2). We also predict that\nthe chicks from younger snow petrels should have a lower probability to survive at the nest (prediction 3). In addition, offspring developmental conditions should also improve with advancing maternal age and younger snow petrels should produce chicks presenting a smaller body size (wing size and tarsus length), with a slower growth and/or a lower body condition (prediction 4). We also predict that offspring physiology will be affected by maternal age. Specifically, developmental energetic constraints are expected to increase the offspring sensitivity to stress. Because younger mothers are expected to be less able to fulfil the energetic needs of their offspring, we then predict that their chicks will present higher basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels (prediction 5). Finally, because telomere attrition is accelerated by increasing developmental constraints, we also predict that younger females should produce chicks with shorter telomeres (prediction 6)."

This species provides bi-parental care both during the incubation and the chick-rearing periods (Warham 1990). At 10\u00a0days old on average, the chick becomes thermally independent and is left unattended at the nest (Goutte et\u00a0al. 2011). Both parents forage at sea to feed their chick and to restore their own body reserves (Chastel et\u00a0al. 1993). The chick fledges approximatively at 47\u00a0days old (Brown 1966; Barbraud et\u00a0al. 1999).\nA 56-years-old ongoing mark-recapture program (see Barbraud and Chastel 1999 for details on the monitoring protocol) has been conducted at Ile des P\u00e9trels, Pointe G\u00e9ologie, Terre Ad\u00e9lie, Antarctica (66\u00b0 40\u2032 S, 140\u00b0 01\u2032 E). At this site, all chicks are banded every year since the beginning of the monitoring program. After fledging, juveniles stay at sea for almost a decade until sexual maturity (Chastel et\u00a0al. 1993; Jenouvrier et\u00a0al. 2005). During that period, the juvenile survival probability varies between 10\u201325% (Chastel et\u00a0al. 1993; Sauser et\u00a0al. 2018). Then, they return to their hatching colony to breed with a high site fidelity (89.8%, Jouventin and Bried 2001).Thanks to this high philopatry and this long-term banding effort, around a hundred of known-aged reproductive birds could be found at Iles des P\u00e9trels during our study. The sex of individuals was determined through relative size of both pair members (females are 20% smaller than males) and acoustic signals (Barbraud et\u00a0al. 2000) or\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

            "text": "During the incubation period of austral summer 2017/2018, we checked the bands of all breeding pairs and this allowed us to know the age of the parents that were banded at the colony as chicks. Because we found more breeding knownaged females than known-aged males, we decided to focus our study on known-aged female snow petrels. This decision also resulted from ecological reasons: female adult snow petrels are smaller than males and they seem to be more energetically constrained during reproduction, and therefore, to have a higher impact on reproductive performance (Barbraud and Chastel 1999; Barbraud et\u00a0al. 1999; but see Fay et\u00a0al. 2016; Bouwhuis et\u00a0al. 2018 in other seabird species). During the incubation period, 56 nests occupied by a knownaged female were identified (range 8\u201334\u00a0years old, which correspond to young and middle-age classes for this species, maximum lifespan: ~ 50\u00a0years old) for this study. All these nests were located in crevices and provided good visibility of the content of the nest from a distance. They were left undisturbed until the hatching period. At that time (early January), these nests were daily checked in order to determine the exact hatching date which is an accurate proxy of the laying date in this species (Goutte et\u00a0al. 2010). Among the 56 monitored pairs, 45 produced a hatchling (Table\u00a01). After hatching, each of these 45 nests with a chick was observed daily from a distance in order to monitor the age when the chick was left alone by its parents (i.e., age of emancipation), and therefore, to determine the duration of the parental guarding stage (i.e., number of days from hatching until the chick is left unattended at the nest by both parents, N = 42 because 3 chicks died before emancipation, Table\u00a01). Each\nnest was then visited when the chick was 13\u00a0days old (i.e., after the end of the guarding period, N = 41 because 4 of the 45 chicks died before reaching 13\u00a0days old, Table\u00a01) and 23\u00a0days old (i.e., N = 35 because 6 chicks died between 13 and 23\u00a0days old, Table\u00a01), respectively. When visiting the nest, the presence of a parent in the nest was also monitored (i.e., parents regularly come at the nest to provide food to the chick during the chick-rearing period; 1: present vs 0: absent) because parental presence can affect corticosterone levels and body condition (Dupont et\u00a0al. 2021). Although one parent was sometimes seen at the nest when the chicks were 13\u00a0days old, all the chicks were alone at 23\u00a0days old and this variable was therefore not considered when analysing the phenotype of 23-days-old chicks.\nMorphometric measurements, body condition and\u00a0growth\nAt 13 and 23\u00a0days old, each surviving chick was captured by hand at its nest (see Table\u00a01 for sample sizes). Tarsus length and wing length were measured with a calliper (\u00b1 0.1\u00a0mm) and a ruler (\u00b1 1\u00a0mm), respectively. All birds were weighed with a spring balance (\u00b1 5\u00a0g). Body condition was calculated using the scaled mass index (SMI) following Peig and Green (2009). Tarsus length was highly correlated with body mass (tarsus: r = 0.869; P < 0.001) and was therefore used to calculate the SMI of growing snow petrels by following this formula: SMI\ni = M i \u00d7 (\nL 0 Li\n) b\n. The terms Mi and Li respectively correspond to the body mass and the tarsus length of the individual i. The term L0 is the arithmetic mean value of tarsus length for the whole study population (L0 = 32.8\u00a0mm). The exponent b corresponds to the slope estimate of a standardized major axis regression of log-transformed body mass on log-transformed tarsus length (b = 2.15).\nSample sizes differ because of chick mortality through the study period and because a sub-sample of 13-days-old chicks were monitored for physiological parameters\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply. Rights reserved.\n67Oecologia (2023) 203:63\u201378\n1 3\nWe then determined the change in body size (wing and tarsus growth) and body condition (SMI) from 13 to 23\u00a0days after hatching for the chicks that survived until this age (N = 35, Table\u00a01). This has been calculated as the difference between body size variables (i.e., wing size and tarsus length) or condition (SMI) measured at day 23 to the data recorded at day 13. To note, if we expressed the change in body size or body condition in terms of percentage, results remain similar. Body mass and body condition were strongly correlated at both ages (F1,39 = 149.6, P < 0.001; F1,33 = 52.4, P < 0.001, respectively for 13- and 23-days-old chicks) and analyses of body mass and body condition gave similar results (see Supplementary File, Annex\u00a01).

            "text": "When chicks were 13\u00a0days old, their corticosterone (hereafter CORT) stress response was measured from blood samples by using a well-established protocol (Wingfield et\u00a0al. 1994). This procedure was conducted on a sub-sample of chicks only, for practical reasons (i.e., bad weather and distance to the station; N = 23, Table\u00a01). Immediately after capture (i.e., within 3\u00a0min, Romero and Reed 2005), an initial blood sample (~ 150\u00a0\u00b5L) was collected from the alar vein with a 25-gauge needle and heparinized microcapillary tubes. This sample was used to measure baseline CORT levels. A second blood sample (~ 150\u00a0\u00b5L) was collected 30\u00a0min after capture and was used to measure the CORT stress response, i.e., the amount of CORT that is released in the bloodstream following a standardized stress protocol (hereafter \u201cstress-induced CORT levels\u201d). Birds were hold in a cloth bag during this 30\u00a0min restraint. These blood samples were also used to measure the telomere length of all sampled chicks (N = 23, Table\u00a01). The corticosterone stress response was not measured when the chicks were 23\u00a0days old.\nCorticosterone assay, molecular sexing, and\u00a0telomere length\nAt the end of each nest visit, blood samples were immediately centrifuged in order to separate plasma and blood red cells. Then, all samples were stored at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C until subsequent analyses at the Centre d\u2019Etudes Biologiques de Chiz\u00e9. Plasma CORT concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay as described previously in Lorm\u00e9e et\u00a0al. (2003).\nThe corticosterone was extracted with diethyl-ether in 50\u00a0\u00b5L of plasma and was then assayed in duplicate with RIA method using H3-corticosterone (Perkin Elmer, US) and rabbit antiserum against corticosterone (Sigma Aldrich,\nUS). RIA corticosterone assay was validated on snow petrel plasma. One extract was serially diluted in the appropriate assay buffer, its displacement curve was parallel to the standard curve. Inter-assay and intra-assay precisions were respectively 13.78% and 6.91%. Corticosterone lowest detectable concentration was 0.28\u00a0ng/mL.\nDNA was extracted from blood red cells of the first blood sample collected as part of the stress response by using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). The sex of each blood sampled chick (N = 23) was determined by molecular sexing, based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the CHD gene, as detailed by Fridolfsson and Ellegren (1999). This sub-sample of chicks allowed us to check for potential sex-dependent effects of maternal age on our variables of interest.\nTelomere length was determined, from the first blood sample collected as part of the stress response, at the Centre d\u2019Etudes Biologiques de Chiz\u00e9. To do so, the TeloTAGGG Telomere Length Assay (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) has been used as previously described (Dupont et\u00a0al. 2018; Angelier et\u00a0 al. 2019), with minor modifications. DNA quality was checked by optical density spectrophotometry. Briefly, 4\u00a0\u03bcg of DNA was digested with restriction enzymes for 16\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Digested DNA samples were then separated with a pulse-field gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad). Then, all samples were run in a single gel at 3.0\u00a0V/cm with an initial switch time of 0.5\u00a0s to a final switch time of 7\u00a0s for 14\u00a0h. After this step, the gel was hybridized with a digoxigenin-labelled probe specific for telomeric sequences, and was visualized with a Chemidoc (Bio Rad). Telomere length was determined using ImageJ by analysing telomere smear densities."

Firstly, we tested whether maternal age was related to hatching date and the length of the guarding period. Secondly, we tested the effect of maternal age, hatching date, and the length of the guarding period on the probability to survive from 13 to 23\u00a0days old. We also tested the influence of offspring body size (tarsus length) and body condition on this survival probability. We then tested the relationships between CORT levels (baseline and stress-induced), telomere length and this survival probability. Finally, we tested the influence of maternal age on body size (tarsus length), body condition and the growth of the chicks. We also tested the influence of maternal age, body condition, and body size on corticosterone levels and telomere length. Parental presence was included when relevant (13-days-old chicks) as a previous study found that this variable can affect body condition and corticosterone levels of young chicks (Dupont et\u00a0al. 2021). Note that the sex of the chicks was not included as an explanatory factor in these analyses because it was available for a limited number of chicks only (N = 23). We ran additional models including the sex factor with this limited sample size and they gave similar results to our main analyses, suggesting that the sex of the offspring does not affect our results."

            "text": "In this study, we showed that maternal age had an important and significant influence on reproductive behaviour and offspring performance. Specifically, older females bred and left their chick alone earlier. Importantly, we also showed that maternal age had an impact on offspring morphology\nand physiology, and ultimately, on chick survival. Importantly, these morphological effects were not found in young chicks (13\u00a0days old), and the influence of maternal age on growth seems to become apparent after that age only as the chicks grow and require an increasing amount of food/ energy. After 13\u00a0days, chicks from older females were larger, heavier, grew faster, and had a higher survival probability at the nest. Moreover, 13-days-old chicks had a higher sensitivity to stress, as shown by moderately higher stress-induced corticosterone levels. Altogether, these results demonstrate not only that younger mothers have lower reproductive performances, but also that maternal age affects the offspring phenotype with potential long-term consequences.\nImportantly, our parental sample size was only composed of young and middle-aged females (< 35\u00a0years old). Therefore, it was not possible to detect sign of senescence on reproductive output in this study (Berman et\u00a0al. 2009).\nThe three best models and the null model are represented.

This decision resulted from practical reasons because we found more known-aged females than known-aged males in our study colony, but also from ecological reasons because female snow petrels are smaller than males. As such, they seem to be more constrained in their ability to deliver food to the offspring and they have a higher impact on reproductive performance than male snow petrels (Barbraud and Chastel 1999; Barbraud et\u00a0al. 1999).\nReproductive phenology, duration of\u00a0the\u00a0guarding period and\u00a0offspring survival\nConsistent with our prediction 1, we found that younger female snow petrels reproduced later. Accordingly, numerous studies have also reported that laying date or hatching date are negatively affected by parental age (Perrins 1970; Curio 1983; de Forest and Gaston 1996; Cam and Monnat 2000; Verhulst and Nilsson 2008; Blas et\u00a0al. 2009; Bauer et\u00a0al. 2018; Res\u00e9ndiz-Infante and Gauthier 2020). In birds, and more specifically snow petrels, laying date and reproductive phenology are influenced by environmental conditions (Barbraud and Chastel 1999; Barbraud and Weimerskirch 2006; Dickey et\u00a0 al. 2008; Verhulst and Nilsson 2008; Moe et\u00a0al. 2009; Descamps et\u00a0al. 2011; Sauser et\u00a0al. 2021) and internal state (body condition: B\u00eaty et\u00a0al. 2003; Descamps et\u00a0al. 2011; stress physiology: Goutte et\u00a0al. 2010). In the snow petrel, Barbraud et\u00a0al. (2000) found that laying date was tightly connected to the duration of the pre-laying exodus, during which females forage at sea to improve their body condition. This suggests that younger females may be less able to acquire food and to build as quickly as older females the body reserves, which are required for egg laying.\nIn addition, we also reported that younger females guarded their chick for a longer period (prediction 2). To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate that maternal age affects the duration of the guarding period in an altricial species. In petrels, the duration of the guarding phase is related to the environmental condition and to the quality of the parents (Amundsen 1995; Tveraa and Christensen 2002; Varpe et\u00a0al. 2004), but also to the chick\u2019s needs in terms of food provisioning and protection (Varpe et\u00a0al. 2004; but see Goutte et\u00a0al. 2011). Leaving a chick unattended can be beneficial because both parents can forage simultaneously\nTable 4 Influence of maternal age, body size, body condition, and parental presence in the nest (for corticosterone levels only) on (a) baseline and (b) stress-induced corticosterone levels and (c) telomere length in 13-days-old snow petrel chicks\nThe three best models and the null model are represented.

However, this may also entail some costs because the chick is left unguarded and is therefore more susceptible to inclement weather and/or predation (Weathers et\u00a0al. 2000; Catry et\u00a0al. 2006). Older females may be better at provisioning their chick during the first days after hatching and their chicks may therefore reach earlier a body condition/size that allow them to thermoregulate. This could explain why older females guarded their chick for shorter periods. Unfortunately, our data did not allow us to test this hypothesis as the first morphometric measurements were recorded at day 13 (i.e., maximum length of the guarding period) for all the chicks and not at the end of the guarding period. This hypothesis is however not supported by the available data because we did not find any difference in body size and body condition at day 13. Instead, older females may be more experienced and better at estimating when the chick can be left alone without any major risk for its survival. Alternatively, older females may be in poorer condition, and as a consequence, they may have to leave the nest unguarded at an earlier age to replenish their body reserves (Tveraa et\u00a0al. 1998). However, this explanation is quite unlikely because previous studies have not found a relationship between age and body condition in this species (Angelier et\u00a0al. 2007a, 2020; Goutte et\u00a0al. 2010).\nIn line with our prediction 3, we found a strong positive correlation between offspring survival at the nest and maternal age, as previously reported in multiple bird species including the snow petrel (Angelier et\u00a0al. 2007a; Sergio et\u00a0al. 2007). Although our sample size was too small to detect a link between phenology and offspring survival, our study confirms that offspring survival is linked to parental age, probably through the timing of reproduction, as previously found in numerous altricial species (Blas et\u00a0al. 2009; Culina et\u00a0al. 2020) including the snow petrel (Sauser et\u00a0al. 2021).\nOffspring growth, body size, and\u00a0body condition\nAccording to our fourth prediction, we found that younger mothers had smaller chicks (i.e., at 23\u00a0days old) compared to older ones, highlighting therefore that maternal age has an important impact on their offspring developmental conditions. Specifically, we found that the chicks from younger females grew slower and reached a lower body size 23\u00a0days after hatching (wing and tarsus length). Importantly, this impact of maternal age on body size was not apparent 13\u00a0days after hatching. This suggests that young females can sustain their offspring needs at the beginning of the developmental period, when the chick is small and cannot ingest large meals. However, the provisioning effort of young females may not be sufficient later as the chick becomes larger and requires increasing amounts of food, explaining the influence of maternal age on growth and body size when\noffspring reaches 23\u00a0days old. In other words, small differences in provisioning effort that are not apparent on day 13 may accumulate through the chick-rearing period, and become significant at a later stage only (i.e., day 23).\nIn our study, the condition of snow petrel chicks was not related to maternal age, suggesting that chicks from young females did not suffer from nutritional stress. Interestingly, we however found that the chicks from younger females grew slower and were smaller at 23\u00a0days old. This suggests that snow petrel chicks may maintain their body condition (a major determinant of post-fledging survival, Sauser et\u00a0al. 2018) at the expense of their body size, which is at least partly developmentally determined (Barbraud et\u00a0al. 1999). This contrasts with other studies, which have suggested that developing seabirds may prioritize growth at the expense of their condition and their survival (e.g., Harris 1966). Interestingly, body size is closely associated with adult performance in this species: smaller snow petrels feed their chick less often and seem to be less efficient foragers (Barbraud et\u00a0al. 1999, 2019). Therefore, chicks from younger females may have lower post-fledging survival probabilities and reproductive performance later in life, although these hypotheses need to be explicitly tested in the future."

Specifically, snow petrel chicks had lower stress-induced CORT when a parent was present in the nest at the time of capture, 13\u00a0days after hatching (see Dupont et\u00a0al. 2021 for further details).\nIn addition, we found that stress-induced CORT levels seem to be affected by maternal age in our study although the effect size could be considered as moderate (\u03b2 = 0.295). Specifically, chicks from older females have higher stressinduced CORT levels, suggesting that they have a higher adrenocortical stress sensitivity (prediction 5). Elevated stress-induced CORT levels are classically associated with a poor body condition and with nutritional stress in chicks (Kitaysky et\u00a0al. 2001; Pravosudov and Kitaysky 2006; Love and Williams 2008; Angelier et\u00a0al. 2022). Our result on stress-induced CORT levels is therefore surprising because we did not find any relationship between maternal age and offspring body condition. Interestingly, this pattern is not equivocal since other studies report no or opposite effects of nutritional stress or poor body condition on stress-induced CORT levels (Wada et\u00a0al. 2009). For example, in the tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata), chicks are known to suppress Hypothalamic\u2013Pituitary\u2013Adrenal (HPA) axis activity and to have therefore lower stress-induced CORT levels when facing nutritional stress (Kitaysky et\u00a0al. 2005). Then, the observed reduced CORT stress sensitivity in 13-days-old\nContent courtesy of Springer Nature, terms of use apply.

However, it remains unclear why older females produce chicks with higher stress-induced CORT levels. In laboratory bird species, the corticosterone stress response increases with age as the chicks develop (Wada et\u00a0al. 2007, 2009) and higher stress-induced corticosterone levels could therefore reflect a more developed HPA axis, and therefore a more advanced developmental state, in the chicks from older mothers. Finally, and importantly, CORT levels were unrelated to offspring survival, questioning therefore the relevance of this physiological marker of fitness in snow petrel chicks. Further studies are definitely needed to better understand how stress-induced CORT levels relate to developmental constraints and offspring survival.\nImportantly, there is increasing evidence that the adrenocortical stress response is repeatable among life-history stages (Wada et\u00a0 al. 2008; Grace and Anderson 2014; Vitousek et\u00a0 al. 2014; Small and Schoech 2015; Jimeno et\u00a0al. 2017), meaning that snow petrel chicks from older females may also have higher stress-induced CORT levels later in life. Although the potential benefits of mounting a strong stress response remains debated (Breuner et\u00a0al. 2008; Angelier and Wingfield 2013; Vitousek et\u00a0al. 2018), having elevated stress-induced CORT levels may promote survival under some situations (Angelier et\u00a0al. 2009). Our study shows for the first time that maternal age can affect offspring CORT stress sensitivity and future studies are now needed to fully understand the fitness consequences of such phenotypic plasticity."

            "text": "Contrary to our sixth prediction and to other studies (e.g., Asghar et\u00a0al. 2015; Dupont et\u00a0al. 2018; Eisenberg 2019), we did not find any relationship between maternal age and offspring telomere length. Other studies also failed to find such an effect of parental age on offspring telomere in vertebrates (e.g., Noguera et\u00a0al. 2018; Belmaker et\u00a0al. 2019; van Lieshout et\u00a0al. 2021), suggesting that the influence of parental age on the telomere length of the progeny varies between species and depends if we consider maternal age or paternal age. Indeed, previous studies in humans have suggested that paternal age could have a stronger impact on telomere length than maternal age (Eisenberg et\u00a0al. 2017). Therefore, maternal age might only be related to offspring telomere length if paternal and maternal age are strongly correlated although this hypothesis has never been explicitly tested in wild vertebrates to our knowledge. In our study, we also did not find any strong relationship between body condition and telomere length in 13-days-old chicks. We however found a negative association between telomere length and\ntarsus length at this age, suggesting that growth may affect telomere attrition and telomere length in snow petrel chicks. Indeed, developmental constraints experienced by the chicks have been shown to affect the allocation of resources to both growth and telomere maintenance (Boonekamp et\u00a0al. 2014; Vedder et\u00a0al. 2017; Monaghan and Ozanne 2018). However, in our study, most of the effects of maternal age on body size were not apparent when the chicks were 13\u00a0days old and they appeared at an older age (e.g., 23\u00a0days old). This could explain why we did not find any strong relationship between telomere length and maternal age in our study. In future studies, it would be relevant to measure telomere length several times during the development to test whether the influence of maternal and paternal age on telomere length exacerbates as the chick grows. Actually, we aimed to sample the chicks 32\u00a0days after hatching in our study, but the colony was no longer accessible later in the season because of successive heavy snowstorms.\nFinally, we found that telomere length was a reliable predictor of survival in snow petrel chicks: 13-days-old chicks with shorter telomere had a lower survival probability until 23\u00a0days old. This link between telomere length and survival at early stage has already been found in an increasing number of studies (Quque et\u00a0al. 2021), and our result supports the idea that telomere length is a relevant proxy of individual quality both at juvenile and adult stages (Angelier et\u00a0al. 2019; Bichet et\u00a0al. 2020)."

Further studies should now aim to examine the influence of both maternal and paternal ages on offspring physiology to better understand how they contribute to offspring quality. Such studies should also investigate the consequence of such physiological modifications on the lifelong performance of the offspring (recruitment and reproduction).\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00442- 023- 05451-5.\nAcknowledgements We are indebted to A.
