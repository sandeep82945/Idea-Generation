1. Investigate the causal relationship between ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders: Most of the studies included in the review were cross-sectional, which limits our understanding of the temporal relationship between ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Longitudinal studies with repeated assessments of ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders are needed to determine the direction of causality.


2. Examine the underlying mechanisms linking ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders: The review highlights the high prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in individuals with ADHD, but the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions remain unclear. Future research should investigate the shared genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors that may contribute to the co-occurrence of ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders.


3. Explore the impact of ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders on functional outcomes: The review focused on the prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in individuals with ADHD, but it did not examine the impact of these comorbidities on functional outcomes such as academic achievement, occupational functioning, and social relationships. Future research should investigate the association between ADHD, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and functional outcomes to better understand the overall burden of these conditions.


4. Develop and evaluate interventions for individuals with ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders: Given the high prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in individuals with ADHD, there is a need for effective interventions that address both conditions. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating integrated interventions that target the symptoms of ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders and improve functional outcomes.


5. Investigate the role of early identification and intervention in preventing or reducing the severity of comorbid psychiatric disorders in individuals with ADHD: Early identification and intervention for ADHD have been shown to improve outcomes, but it is unclear whether early intervention can also prevent or reduce the severity of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Future research should examine the long-term effects of early identification and intervention for ADHD on the development of comorbid psychiatric disorders.
