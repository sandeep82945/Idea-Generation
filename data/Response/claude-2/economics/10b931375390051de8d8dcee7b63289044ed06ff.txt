 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II and III colon cancer using contemporary real-world data on outcomes, costs, and utilities. This could provide more accurate estimates compared to relying solely on clinical trial data.

2. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of biomarker-guided approaches to adjuvant chemotherapy selection in stage II colon cancer using data from large prospective studies like DYNAMIC. This could provide more robust evidence than the preliminary studies discussed. 

3. Incorporate patient-reported outcomes like quality of life into ongoing clinical trials of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. This would allow direct measurement of utilities and societal costs relevant to the study population.

4. Conduct head-to-head comparisons of the cost-effectiveness of 3 months versus 6 months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimens like FOLFOX and CAPOX for stage III colon cancer. Most studies only compared to 5-FU alone.

5. Evaluate the long-term costs and disutility associated with oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity. This is a key consideration in determining cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin regimens but was inconsistently examined in the reviewed studies.
