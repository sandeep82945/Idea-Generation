    "abstractText": "The present study aimed to illustrate the hypolipemic effect of 10-Dehydrogengardione (10-DHG) or caffeic acid (CA) with reference to the role of microRNA-122 (miR-122) and ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) activity. Diabetic hyperlipidemia was induced in rats, and then randomly classified into three groups. The first one received only a CCT-diet for 6 weeks and was referred to as the positive control. The other two groups received 10-DHG (10 mg/kg/day) or CA (50 mg/kg/day), orally for 6 weeks along with a CCT-diet. Another group of normal rats was included, received a normal diet, and was referred to as the negative control. Either 10-DHG or CA significantly decreased MiR-122 expression and appeared more remarkable in the CA group by 15.5%. The 10-DHG greatly enhanced phosphorylated form of AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) activity, more than CA by 1.18-fold, while the latter exerted more inhibitory effect on ACLY, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) activities compared with 10-DHG (p < 0.05). Both drugs significantly decreased hydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-COA) reductase activity, which appeared more remarkable in 10-DHG, and significantly decreased triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) along with a high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increase. The 10DHG ameliorated the hepatic tissue lesions greatly, more than CA. The 10-DHG or CA significantly inhibited MiR-122, hepatic FAS, and ACLY levels along with p-AMPK activation. This subsequently led to reduced plasma TG, cholesterol levels, and blood glucose improvement and, indeed, may explain their mechanisms as hypolipemic agents.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a well-known class of short non-coding RNAs that controls the expression of particular target genes through binding to complementary regions on mRNA, cleaving or blocking the translation of target MRNA. miRNAs can serve in additional significant regulatory roles in a wide range of biological processes, and more than 60% of human genes are modulated by miRNAs [1]. The latter control various metabolic pathways including insulin secretion and glucose and lipid metabolism [2], and its downregulation exerts a certain role in the development of chronic disorders such as obesity, NAFLD, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases [3]. MiR-122 is a unique liver-specific one that constitutes nearly 70% of the hepatic miRNAs [4], and several genes that control TG and fatty acid synthesis are regulated by miR-122, including FAS and ACLY [5]. miR-122 inhibition, on the other hand, can\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 726. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11030726 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 726 2 of 12\nremarkably decrease certain important genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis such as HMG-CoA reductase [6]. Lipid metabolism is controlled also by many lipogenic proteins, including FAS, which is involved in lipolysis and lipogenesis. The latter includes FAS participation in the catalysis of acetyl-CoA conversion to malonyl-CoA; FAS in excess can impair lipid metabolism, leading to significant fat accumulation and many metabolic disorders such as NAFLD, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity [7]. ACLY is an important enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids, as well as in the catabolism of other nutrients, abundantly expressed in the liver, adipose, and other lipogenic tissues in mammals. ACLY catalyzes the conversion of citrate into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate in the presence of ATP and CoA [8], and deregulation of either the activity or the liver protein expression may be connected to NAFLD, hyperlipidemia, or type 2 diabetes mellitus [9]. The main metabolic sensor, AMPK, is an important regulatory enzyme that enhances ATP-generating pathways such as fatty acid oxidation along with the inhibition of energystorage processes such as fatty acid biosynthesis. miR-122 inhibition can enhance p-AMPK activation and promote a shift in energy utilization through inhibition of ACC2 and FAS [10]. Synthetic drug categories, mostly effective as hypolipemics, are many; however, most of them exhibit variable side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, myositis, and impaired liver function. Natural products or traditional drugs are becoming more and more popular as alternative treatment options because of their safety [11]. 10-Dehydrogingerdione (10-DHG), a biologically active compound derived from the plant ginger rhizome (Zingiber officinale), demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and hypolipemic characteristics and, additionally, remarkably increased nitric oxide release [12], and it proved to prevent the aortic calcifications in dyslipidemic rabbits [13]. Caffeic acid (CA) is a phenolic compound belonging to hydroxyl cinnamic acid derivatives, and it is available in human diets in berries, kiwis, plums, apples, many vegetables, and coffee [14]. A previous study indicated that CA and its derivatives have antibacterial, hypoglycemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardiovascular protective effects [15]. Another study demonstrated its inhibitory effect on oxidative modification of LDL, mostly implicated in the development of atherosclerosis [16]. Accordingly, the present study aimed mainly to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of 10-DHG and CA, individually through targeting specific pathways, effective enzymes dealing with either lipogenesis, or lipolysis, focusing on the role of miR-122 and ACLY activity. A histological study of liver tissue was also done to demonstrate any correlation between the biomarkers studied and the histopathological findings."

            "text": "The present study illustrates the hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effects of CA and 10-DHG in diabetic hyperlipidemic rats. This was attributed mostly to inhibition of miR-122 and liver lipogenic enzymes (FAS and ACLY), along with p-AMPK activation. miR-122, as reported before, can regulate fat metabolism in the liver, meaning that its overexpression or suppression may induce changes in the synthesis of fatty acids and\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 726 9 of 12\ncholesterol. It was indicated also that using antisense oligonucleotides to block miR-122 expression in normal mice significantly decreased cholesterol levels, hepatic fatty acid, and cholesterol synthesis and, additionally, activation of fatty acid oxidation and p-AMPK. This can block the activity of important enzymes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Blocking of miR-122 expression in obese mice models using the same technique resulted in repression of plasma cholesterol and improved liver tissue steatosis by repressing the gene expressions related to fatty acid synthesis such as FAS and ACLY [10]. miR-122 inhibition also significantly decreased plasma cholesterol through repression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis such as HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase [6]. The present study, in agreement, demonstrated similar findings to those mentioned above. Taking into consideration that the metabolic energy balance in the entire body is controlled by p-AMPK, a critical cellular energy sensor Liver p-AMPK activation stimulates, in turn, certain catabolic pathways, resulting in hypoglycemic and lipolytic effects [29] and concomitant suppression of miR-122 in the liver activates hepatic p-AMPK [30]. This may be mediated either directly or indirectly where p-AMPK activities showed an inverse correlation with miR-122 expression [31]. Accordingly, increased activity of hepatic pAMPK by CA and 10-DHG intake might be attributed to inhibition of MiR-122 expression in our diabetic hyperlipidemic rat model. FAS is an essential metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl CoA and monoacyl malonate CoA into palmitic acid [32]. A previous study reported that miR-122 regulated FAS in an indirect manner via an unidentified pathway [33]. The present results were in agreement with these findings; meanwhile, the expression of some lipogenic genes as FAS showed a dramatic increase following the overexpression of miR-122 in HFD rats, leading to lipid accumulation [1,34,35]. HMG-CoA reductase represents the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis where it catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA into the mevalonate step [36]. Many reports illustrated that miR-122 suppression induced a reduction in HMG CoA reductase expression and, indeed, a plasma cholesterol decrease [10,37]. Administration of 10-DHG in the present study significantly decreased plasma cholesterol and might be attributed to reductions in both miR-122 expression and HMG-CoA reductase activity. It had been reported before that certain phenolic compounds (plant derived) significantly downregulated liver miR-122 expression in mice [38,39]. CA is a phenolic compound (plant derived) and is widely present in nature, and its potential to increase p-AMPK activation and to decrease FAS and HMG-CoA reductase activities was reported before [40]. Another study in human-cell carcinoma lines reported that CA had an inhibitory effect on the expression of FAS and ACLY [41]. A recent study indicated also that daily administration of CA for 5 weeks resulted in significant hypoglycemia in diabetic rats, joined with a remarkable antioxidant effect [42]. The present study was in agreement with these findings and might explain the hypolipemic effect of CA. A previous study demonstrated ginger extract\u2019s potential to suppress hepatic de novo lipogenesis and attributed it to a hepatic mRNA-level decrease in lipogenic enzymes such as FAS [43]. It also prevented the HFD-induced elevation of HMG-CoA reductase protein in the rat liver, affecting, in turn, cholesterol biosynthesis [44], and additionally decreased significantly the blood sugar levels in diabetic animal models [45,46]. Accordingly, the reduction observed in hepatic FAS, ACLY, and HMG-CoA reductase along with hepatic pAMPK activation leading to decreased TC and TG along with blood glucose improvement after 10-DHG intake may present an explanation for its mechanism as a hypolipemic agent. CA intake induced in turn and to certain extent similar findings as compared to the 10-DHG results.\nAuthor Contributions: M.M.E.: conceptualization, writing, and revision of the manuscript; A.S.E.: methodology and conducted the statistics; G.M.E.: supervised practical work, preparation of original draft, review, and editing; M.S.S. and N.A.A.-G.: performed the histopathology\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 726 10 of 12\nsection and interpreted the data; A.H.A.: analysis and investigation.
