1. **Investigate the long-term effects of NRPS on the health status of elderly people with chronic diseases.** The current study only examined the short-term effects of NRPS on health status. It would be valuable to conduct a longitudinal study to examine the long-term effects of NRPS on health status, as well as the potential impact of NRPS on mortality and other health outcomes.


2. **Examine the impact of NRPS on the health status of elderly people with different types of chronic diseases.** The current study only examined the impact of NRPS on the health status of elderly people with COPD and asthma. It would be valuable to conduct a study to examine the impact of NRPS on the health status of elderly people with other types of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease.


3. **Explore the mechanisms through which NRPS improves the health status of elderly people with chronic diseases.** The current study did not explore the mechanisms through which NRPS improves the health status of elderly people with chronic diseases. It would be valuable to conduct a study to explore these mechanisms, such as the impact of NRPS on access to healthcare, medication adherence, and lifestyle behaviors.


4. **Compare the effectiveness of NRPS with other social security programs in improving the health status of elderly people with chronic diseases.** The current study only examined the impact of NRPS on the health status of elderly people with chronic diseases. It would be valuable to conduct a study to compare the effectiveness of NRPS with other social security programs, such as the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), in improving the health status of elderly people with chronic diseases.


5. **Develop and evaluate interventions to increase the take-up rate of NRPS among elderly people with chronic diseases.** The current study found that the take-up rate of NRPS among elderly people with chronic diseases was relatively low. It would be valuable to develop and evaluate interventions to increase the take-up rate of NRPS among elderly people with chronic diseases, such as providing information about the benefits of NRPS and assisting elderly people with the application process.
