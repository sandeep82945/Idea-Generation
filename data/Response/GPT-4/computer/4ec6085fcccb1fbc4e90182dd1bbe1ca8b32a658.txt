Expansion to Additional Languages and Dialects: While the paper focuses on English, Japanese, and Korean translations, future research could explore the application of the framework to additional languages, including those with significant linguistic differences from the ones studied, such as tonal languages (e.g., Chinese, Vietnamese) or languages with complex morphologies (e.g., Arabic, Finnish). This expansion would test the framework's universality and adaptability to diverse linguistic structures and cultural contexts.

Incorporation of Musical Information: The paper mentions the limitation of not incorporating musical notes into the experiment. Future studies could focus on integrating musical notes and rhythms into the evaluation metrics to assess how the melody influences the singability of translations. This research could involve developing algorithms that consider musical notation alongside phonetic and semantic aspects of lyrics, potentially leading to a more holistic approach to lyric translation.

Automated Generation of Singable Lyrics: Building on the evaluation framework, research could be directed towards the automatic generation of singable lyrics in different languages. By leveraging advancements in machine learning and natural language processing, this research could aim to produce singable, semantically coherent translations that adhere to the musical structure of the original song, thus automating the translation process while ensuring high quality.

Cultural Impact Analysis of Lyric Translations: The paper hints at the importance of cultural understanding in lyric translation. Future research could delve deeper into how cultural elements are preserved or transformed in the translation process. This could involve analyzing the impact of cultural references, idioms, and societal norms on the translatability and reception of translated lyrics across different cultures, potentially leading to insights on intercultural communication through music.

Genre-specific Translation Challenges and Strategies: Given that the dataset covers a range of genres, future studies could focus on the specific challenges and strategies associated with translating lyrics of different music genres. This could involve identifying genre-specific characteristics that influence translation, such as the use of slang in hip-hop or the storytelling nature of folk music. Research could aim to develop tailored approaches that respect the unique features of each genre while maintaining singability and semantic coherence.
