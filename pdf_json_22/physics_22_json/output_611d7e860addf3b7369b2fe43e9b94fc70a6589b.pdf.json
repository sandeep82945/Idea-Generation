Such processes are used, for example, to produce printed electronics, liquid display screens, high quality papers used for printing, and more1,2. Industrial processes are inevitably subject to ambient disturbances, some impulsive such as those from the sudden repositioning of equipment, and some repetitive from vibrations due to pumps and fans. Perhaps the simplest model for the response of fluid flows to repetitive disturbances is the so-called \u201csignaling\u201d problem, defined in one dimension (1D) as\nLh = A f ei\u03c9 f t\u03b4 (x), (1)\nwhere L is a linear governing operator, t is time, A f is the forcing amplitude, \u03c9 f is the forcing frequency, \u03b4 (x) is the Dirac delta function, and x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e). Equation (1) is subject to constraints to make the problem well-posed; the number of constraints is determined from the number of spatial and time derivatives in L. The signaling problem admits two components of the solution, the transient behavior due to the start-up of the disturbance and the long-time signaling behavior due to the oscillatory forcing. While most real-world disturbances occur over multiple frequencies and locations, (1) provides a simple model from which the responses to arbitrary forcing functions\n3\ncan be constructed via superposition and the method of Green\u2019s functions; these are afforded by the linearity of the operator. The motivation of this paper lies in the need to determine how the response to signaling from inevitable disturbances in manufacturing flows will propagate; this includes a characterization of both the breadth (how much of the product will be affected) and the amplitude of the response (how badly will the product be affected).\nIn order to characterize the response of (1), a first step is to examine the stability of the unforced medium itself by assessing response behavior of the homogeneous form Lh = 0; this approach, known as classical stability analysis, is used extensively in the hydrodynamic literature3\u20136. The solution to the homogeneous equation is expressed as an infinite sum of complex modes,\nh(x, t) = \u2211hk(x, t) = \u2211Akei(krx\u2212\u03c9t) (2)\nwith complex amplitude, Ak, real wave number, kr, and complex frequency, \u03c9 = \u03c9r + i\u03c9i. The form (2) is substituted into the homogeneous operator without constraints, and nontrivial solutions are obtained that enable Ak to be arbitrary. The result is a dispersion relation of the form \u03c9 =\u03c9(kr). Notably, the assumed modal form, hk, can be rewritten as an exponential term multiplied by an oscillatory term,\nhk = Ake(\u03c9it)ei(krx\u2212\u03c9r)t . (3)\nIn the summation (2), the mode (or modes) that grows the fastest or decays the slowest will dominate the overall response as time goes to infinity. Therefore, we can express the maximum magnitude of hmax for \u03c9i,max \u2261 max(Im[\u03c9]) and with the associated Ak value Amax as\n|hmax| \u223c \u2223\u2223Amaxe\u03c9imaxt\u2223\u2223 as t\u2192 \u221e. (4)\nIn (4), the sign of \u03c9i,max is used to determine the classical stability for a given set of conditions as follows3,4,7:\n\u03c9i,max < 0 : The system is stable: exponential decay results, (5a)\n\u03c9i,max = 0 : The system is neutrally stable: no growth or decay results, (5b)\n\u03c9i,max > 0 : The system is unstable: exponential growth results. (5c)\nHowever, the method fails to properly classify neutrally stable (5b) cases where the maximum value (or all values) of \u03c9i is zero. Such cases can lead to emergent algebraic behavior, as seen in8,9 (and the references therein), where the solution magnitude goes as t raised to a fractional\n4\npower, such as t1/2 or t\u22121/2. Such behavior is fascinating because it arises from the summation of modes and cannot be deduced from any individual exponential mode or finite set of modes as in classically stable or unstable systems.\nAs shown in previous literature10\u201312, the spatio-temporal stability of the underlying medium itself (deduced from the homogeneous governing equation (1)) is central to the relevance of signaling. In fact, transients are carried by the homogeneous solution, and these are initiated at t = 0 in any system through initial conditions. Previous work on signaling in spatio-temporal systems has focused on systems having exponential growth or decay in time according to (4) and (5). If a flow is temporally stable, then the effects of transients damp exponentially with time and the response to the forcing in (1) persists as the dominant solution. Alternatively, if a flow is temporally unstable but convective, transients propagate away from the source even as they grow exponentially with time, and once again, the response to forcing in (1) remains in any finite domain after the transient passes through. In this case, then, the processes can be controlled by minimizing disturbances and adjusting the rate at which exponential growth occurs through the choice of process conditions13, so that the response magnitude remains sufficiently small over a given finite domain. If a flow is absolutely unstable, however, transients remain in the domain, never dissipate as they grow exponentially with time, and overwhelm the effect of forcing in (1); therefore, the forcing solution in this case is subdominant to the transients at large times and thus is not of practical importance. Absolutely unstable processes cannot be controlled by minimizing process disturbances, as responses remain in the domain as they grow. As a result, it is impossible to maintain a high-precision process in absolutely unstable systems as products are pushed out of specifications.\nThus far, the solution response governed by linear operators that admit algebraic growth has only been studied for impulsive forcings8,9. In this work, we elucidate the structure of the response of a neutrally stable flow to a localized oscillatory forcing (i.e., the signaling problem (1)). Relevant background is the closely-related signaling problem for operators that admit exponential growth and decay; see Barlow et al.11 and references contained therein for an extensive review. Fig. 1 provides a schematic of the signaling response in such cases. As indicated, the structure of the solution is delineated by well-defined velocities; these velocities are extracted naturally from the long-time behavior using the method of steepest descent14. In particular, one can readily extract the bounding envelope of the transient (V+,V\u2212) from the asymptotic expressions where the growth rate of the transient is zero, the farthest extent of the so-called signaling region (VI) from pole inclusion in the relevant contour integrations, and the velocity (VE) from the equality of the\n5\ntransient and forced oscillation response amplitudes. We demonstrate herein that the structure of the signaling response in a system that admits algebraic growth also has critical velocities, but the structure is markedly different. The neutrally stable system studied in this paper only has two types of velocities relevant to the overall structure: Those that correspond to the peak of the transient (of the type Vmax in Fig. 1) and those due to the inclusion of poles (of the type VI in Fig. 1). While our approach is analogous to the studies that map the regions of interaction between exponentially growing waves (in space and time) in a classically unstable signaling problem10\u201312, the signaling problem examined here has a distinctly different structure that is explored through asymptotic analysis.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we pose the signaling problem that governs varicose waves in an inviscid planar liquid sheet at neutral stability. The governing linear operator here admits algebraic growth of waves when initiated by an impulse disturbance, as shown by King et al.8. In the subsequent sections, the signaling response is fully characterized through Fourier analysis and asymptotic methods. This examination begins in Section III, where the Fourier integral solution is provided. In Section III A, critical velocities are determined that delineate regions of the signaling response \u2014 this parallels the structure found in responses that exhibit exponential growth or decay as discussed above. Section III B describes the method to extract the bounding amplitudes of the oscillatory signaling response via analytical means. In Section IV, results showing the structure of the signaling response are provided, and Section V provides additional\n6\ndiscussion on the relationship between critical velocities and the breadth of the response. The results are discussed in Section VI; this section also includes discussion which contrasts signaling in systems that admit algebraic and exponential growth. Concluding remarks are provided in Section VII."

In order to study different phases of sinusoidal forcing, A f is taken to be complex. Note that in King et al., \u03b4 (t) is used instead of ei\u03c9 f t in the right-hand side of (6a), as the focus of that work is the response of the operator to impulsive disturbances8.\nPhysically, the linear operator in (6) governs the propagation of long varicose waves in an inviscid planar liquid sheet in the absence of ambient gas once the identifications B =We\u22121/2 and c = 1 are made15. In this context, We = \u03c1lu 2h0\n\u03c3 is the dimensionless Weber number, where \u03c1l is\nthe liquid density, u is the liquid velocity in the sheet, h0 is the half-sheet thickness, and \u03c3 is the surface tension; a schematic is provided in Fig. 2. This flow has long been known to be neutrally stable15,16 in accordance with (5) and exhibits algebraic instability8,17 when U0 is nonzero. In the context of varicose waves in liquid sheets, the oscillatory forcing introduced here has only been studied for responses, taken in the presence of ambient gas, that admit exponential growth12 and are governed by a different operator than (6). In the following sections, we uncover, for the first time, the structure that arises when signaling is imposed on a neutrally stable flow.\nBecause the partial differential equation (PDE) in (6) is linear, the dependent variable, H, can\nbe expressed by superposition as follows:\nH(x, t) = g(x, t)+h(x, t),\n7\nwhere g and h are expressed as\n\u2202 2g \u2202 t2 + c2 \u2202 2g \u2202x2 +2c \u2202 2g \u2202x\u2202 t +B2 \u2202 4g \u2202x4 = 0, (7a)\ng(x,0) = H0\u03b4 (x), \u2202g \u2202 t (x,0) =U0\u03b4 (x), g\u2192 0 as x\u2192\u00b1\u221e, (7b)\nand \u2202 2h \u2202 t2 + c2 \u2202 2h \u2202x2 +2c \u2202 2h \u2202x\u2202 t +B2 \u2202 4h \u2202x4 = A f e(i\u03c9 f t)\u03b4 (x), (8a)\nh(x,0) = 0, \u2202h \u2202 t (x,0) = 0, h\u2192 0 as x\u2192\u00b1\u221e. (8b)\nThe split between (7) and (8) allows us to study the effect of the forcing in (8) without repeating the work done by King et al.8. Note that equation (7) omits the impulsive forcing (A\u03b4 (x)\u03b4 (t)) present in King et al. as it can be shown that it is equivalent to a disturbance in the initial surface velocity with A = U0 in (7). King et al. found that, for nonzero U0, the solution propagates and grows as t1/2 along the single velocity x/t = c; however, a nonzero displacement H0 in (7b) yields a damped solution. The superposition above allows us to focus specifically on the response to the oscillatory forcing in (8), and how the long-time response to the forcing (i.e., signaling) evolves past the transients invoked by the start-up.\n8"

Note that the introduction of V as a fixed parameter naturally arises through analysis of the long-time asymptotics of the integral. Furthermore, from prior work discussed in Section I, structural changes in the solution are naturally characterized by different values of V .\nA key feature of the integrals in (9) are the poles k0 through k3 which arise from the forcing function. When we evaluate (9b) and (9c) through complex contour integration, the location of the poles determines whether they have an effect on the solution; contours are examined in Supplemental Material Sections S3 and S4. A significant change occurs in the structure based on the sign of square root discriminants in (9d). The critical value of forcing frequency, denoted as \u03c9c, arises when the discriminants of k0 and k1 are zero, i.e.\n\u03c9c = c2\n4B . (10)\nWhen the system is forced at a frequency lower than the critical value (\u03c9 f < \u03c9c), all four poles lie on the real k axis, as shown in Fig. 3. When the system is forced at a frequency higher than the critical value (\u03c9 f > \u03c9c), poles k0 and k1 (9d) lie off of the real k axis and poles k2 and k3 (9d) lie on the real k axis, as shown in Fig. 4. In what follows, we will explore the structure arising from values of \u03c9 f < \u03c9c and \u03c9 f > \u03c9c. The case of \u03c9 f = \u03c9c is examined using the Fourier Series\n9\nSolution (FSS) (Appendix A 1) of (8) and addressed at the end of Section V. As shall be seen in Appendix B, the location of the poles in Figs. 3 and 4 is crucial to the asymptotic evaluation of the Fourier integral solution (9) in the limit as t \u2192 \u221e. A key detail of the analysis is that contour integration is used to evaluate the integrals in (9), and the position of the contour in the complex plane is a function of the velocity V . This means that, for a fixed set of parameters, the velocity at which the integral is being evaluated determines the poles that are enclosed, and this, in turn, determines the structure of the solution. The details of the asymptotic evaluation of the inversion integrals is provided in Appendix B."

            "heading": "A. Approach to determine critical velocities",
            "text": "Critical velocities examined in spatio-temporal problems have been used to delineate structural changes in solution responses having exponential growth or decay4 as shown in Fig. 1. However, many of the critical velocities in such systems are based on transitions between exponentially growing and decaying portions of the solution response10\u201312. Thus, many of the \u201cbounding velocities\u201d and associated structural changes are different when an operator that admits algebraic growth is considered.\nHere, we define critical velocities as those which \u2014 based on pole, saddle, and contour orientation \u2014 delineate structural changes in the solution. Of these critical velocities, there are two\n10\ncategories, observable and non-observable. Observable critical velocities delineate distinct regions of the solution response that persist in the long-time limit, while non-observable critical velocities are those where structural changes do not persist in that limit. The widths of these regions are crucial to understanding how disturbances propagate in a forced neutral flow such as (8). Although observable critical velocities may be approximated by inspection from a numerical or FSS (Appendix A 1), analytical expressions for these velocities emerge from the long-time asymptotic solution. All of the critical velocities can be extracted early in the process of the asymptotic analysis, but require more work to definitively distinguish between those that lead to observable changes in solution response in the long time limit (observable critical velocities) and those that do not (non-observable critical velocities).\nTwo critical velocities can be identified immediately without additional analysis. The zero velocity, V = 0, delineates the upstream and downstream directions and is the location of the imposed oscillatory disturbance. The peak velocity, V = c, is extracted from the homogeneous form of the equation by King et al.8 and provides the velocity of the algebraically growing peak. In order to determine the additional critical velocities relevant to the signaling problem, we note that the Fourier integrals in (9) are of similar form, and can be written generally as:\nIntegral = \u221e\u222b \u2212\u221e 1 f (k) e\u03c6(k)tdk. (11)\nIn (11), there are a finite number of simple poles, ki, where f (ki) = 0 and some value of ks(V ), which is an nth order saddle point of \u03c6(k), such that d n\u22121 dkn\u22121 (\u03c6) \u2223\u2223 ks = 0 and d n dkn (\u03c6) \u2223\u2223 ks 6= 0. The behavior of the integral near saddle points is relevant to the long-time asymptotic behavior via the method of steepest descents14. The location of the saddle point is a function of V (i.e., ks = ks(V )), indicating that any given velocity corresponds to a saddle point. Each saddle point leads to a different arrangement of the complex contours used in the asymptotic analysis (see Appendix B). For a given velocity and set of parameters, the poles are either enclosed, not enclosed, or intersected by the contour. Critical velocities are extracted by finding all the real values of V where a pole of f (k) intersects a contour. The simplest critical velocities to determine are those associated with the poles that lie on the locus of saddle points, as it is only a matter of setting ks(V ) = ki and solving for V . The velocities associated with poles that lie off the locus of saddles are more difficult to find, as they require establishing how the contours sweep through the complex k plane as shown in Appendix B and the Supplemental Material. Note that, for (8), the locus of saddles lies along the entirety of the real k axis. In what follows, no distinction will be made between the \u201clocus of\n11\nsaddles\u201d and \u201creal k axis\u201d.\nOverall, then, every critical velocity (besides V = 0 and V = c) corresponds to either: (i) a change in whether a given pole is enclosed or not within a contour (going from not enclosed to enclosed or vice versa) or (ii) the situation where a saddle point and pole are coincident. As defined earlier, these velocities indicate where structural changes in the solution could occur at long times. Once all the critical velocities are found, they can be overlaid on a numerical or Fourier series solution to visually determine those which yield significant changes in the solution (i.e., are observable critical velocities) without having to undertake a full asymptotic analysis. If a term in the asymptotic form associated with a critical velocity decays exponentially in time when active, then it will not have any lingering structural effect on the solution response at large times. These velocities correspond to the off-axis pole locations in Fig. 4 and are non-observable. The only observable critical velocities, then, are those associated with the coincidence of a pole and saddle along the real k axis. In fact, it is the difference in the number of on-axis poles that accounts for the differences in the solution structure associated with the cases \u03c9 f < \u03c9c and \u03c9 f > \u03c9c configurations as will be seen. Note that observable critical velocities bound upstream and downstream regions of the response, and it is possible to identify portions of the response corresponding to transients and the oscillatory forcing. In light of comments made in the introduction regarding damage to thin film coatings, the breadth of these regions, as well as the amplitude of the response within them, is of practical relevance."

            "text": "Within each region delineated by the critical velocities of Section III A, there are three potential outcomes; the disturbance grows, decays, or oscillates with a constant amplitude. At large times, the spatial resolution needed to accurately predict features of the solution is quite large (see Appendix A 2 for more details). As the solution has an oscillatory character in each region, a bounding amplitude enables us to determine the maximum damage to the liquid sheet without needing to obtain the full solution to the required resolution. The bounding amplitude can certainly be extracted numerically by looking at the solution response, although this must be done individually for every set of parameters. Bounding amplitudes can be extracted analytically using the long-time asymptotic solutions and, as such, this section provides a higher level discussion about how such amplitudes are extracted.\n12\nTo extract the amplitude of the solution within a single region between two adjacent critical velocities Vn and Vm, we note that the asymptotic solution is expressed as a sum of one or more distinct exponentials with different phases (see Sections III C and III D). The general form of the asymptotic solution is written as\nReal[h(x, t)]\u223c Real\n[ N\n\u2211 n=1\n\u03b1nei\u03b2n(V )t ] V \u2208 [Vn,Vm] as t\u2192 \u221e, (12)\nwhere \u03b1n is some complex constant.

Note that the large number of oscillations in the solution are not caused by numerical noise or aliasing \u2014 the solution indeed responds in this way, and when magnified in any region, is entirely smooth (see Appendix A 2 for additional details on resolving oscillations). Fig. 5 is presented in terms of the velocity V \u2261 x/t as this domain provides critical insight into the structure of the solution; we elaborate on this below. Note that at any time t, the V domain may be interpreted as being simply a rescaling of x; the V domain has the advantage that the structural features are kept stationary in time for a fixed V domain. When viewing the solution in terms of V , the frequencies of the oscillations increase with time; as additional wave cycles are compressed into a fixed range of V , the density of the wave cycles increases, leading to solutions which appear to be rectangular blocks (Figs. 5 and 7). It is important to note, however, that the region between any two velocities Vn and Vm at time t covers a spatial distance of (Vm\u2212Vn)t and thus expands with time. If we look at a fixed value of t, V is a direct scaling of x for the entire domain. If we look at a fixed point in x, however, the point will move towards decreasingly smaller V values as time progresses. For any non-zero x location, small\n13\ntimes correspond to large magnitudes of V . As t increases, the magnitude of V decreases until the x location sees a change in structure at an observable critical velocity. As t continues to increase and approaches infinity, the magnitude of V approaches zero for the x location. Therefore, the long-time solution for any finite x value may be deduced based on the behavior of the solution near V = 0 where there are no further transitions in structure across critical velocities.\nApplying the methodology from Sections III A and III B to the long-time asymptotic solution of (9) (see Appendix D 1) leads to analytical expressions for the solution response, bounding amplitudes of each region, and the associated critical velocities that separate them.

            "text": "Above the critical frequency, \u03c9c given in (10), the solution has a similar structure as the \u03c9 f <\u03c9c case. As the forcing frequency is increased towards the critical frequency in Fig. 9, the velocities V2 and V3 move towards V = 0. Across the critical frequency, the regions B2 and C2 collapse, leaving only the regions B and C as shown in Fig. 17. Additional details on this transition are included in Section V.\nOne feature of the solution for \u03c9 f > \u03c9c is that the oscillation frequencies in the response are much higher than those for \u03c9 f < \u03c9c, and thus significant magnification is needed to observe individual wave-forms and transitions between regions. The same qualitative features of the solution are seen across bounding velocities \u2014 the FSS (Appendix A 1) is always continuous and smooth, the asymptotic solution agrees with the FSS away from critical velocities (but not close to them), and discontinuities across critical velocities can be observed in some transitions between regions. In what follows, we discuss the physics of these regions in a more abbreviated form, comparing and contrasting with the \u03c9 f < \u03c9c case discussed in Section IV A.\n30\nThe long-time Forced Solution near V = 0 corresponds to the regions B and C in Fig. 17; this differs from the \u03c9 f < \u03c9c case, where regions B2 and C2 formed the long time amplitude. As mentioned before, Fig. 17 has fewer distinct regions than Fig. 9. Due to the collapse of V2 and V3 as \u03c9 f transitions past \u03c9c, the \u03c9 f > \u03c9c case has no equivalent regions to B2 and C2 as for the \u03c9 f < \u03c9c case (compare Figs. 9 and 17). This difference is also seen by inspection of the asymptotic forms and bounding amplitudes for the \u03c9 f < \u03c9c and \u03c9 f > \u03c9c cases given by (15) and (17), respectively; it can be seen that the Forced Regions of both cases are the result of the contributions of a single pole each, k3 in the upstream regions and k2 in the downstream regions (see Fig. 3 for pole structure).\nAs with the case where \u03c9 f < \u03c9c, the outer regions A and D in Fig. 17 are the Asymptotically Undisturbed Regions that limit to zero amplitude as t approaches infinity. The critical velocity of V = 0 divides the upstream and downstream behavior as before. Across this velocity, both the Fourier series and asymptotic solutions are continuous and the solutions have different frequencies and amplitudes on either side as for \u03c9 f < \u03c9c. Similarly to the \u03c9 f < \u03c9c results, the asymptotic solution and FSS disagree near the critical velocity of V = c; however, in this case, it is for a different reason. For \u03c9 f > \u03c9c, the FSS and asymptotic solutions agree when V = c, and this is true for nearby velocities as well. In the \u03c9 f < \u03c9c case, however, the asymptotic solution diverges for velocities near V = c due to the nonumiformity of the large time limit (see Section IV A 7 above). The reason for this behavior difference is that the real part of the solution does not diverge when \u03c9 f > \u03c9c; it is the imaginary part which demonstrates similar divergence to the \u03c9 f < \u03c9c case. If A f is real, the long-time asymptotic solution is continuous across V = c, whereas it is not for \u03c9 f < \u03c9c."

            "text": "We now describe how the breadth of the regions described in Sections IV A and IV B change with varying \u03c9 f . Fig. 18 shows the loci of observable critical velocities in the solution to (8). It was generated by plotting the four velocities V1 through V4, given in (14) and (16), for a range of \u03c9 f values holding all other parameter fixed at the same values used in prior figures. For a value of \u03c9 f below the critical frequency (red horizontal line), we can see that there are four critical velocities, two upstream and two downstream. The outer pair (V1 and V4) are the Leading Edges of the Forced Solution and the inner pair (V2 and V3) are the Leading Edges of the Additionally\n31\nForced Regions. For a value of \u03c9 f above the critical frequency (blue horizontal line), we can see that there are only two critical velocities (V1 and V4) \u2014 the pair are the Leading Edges of the Forced Solution. Note that the two inner velocities converge on V = 0 as \u03c9 approaches \u03c9c from below.\nRelating Fig. 18 back to the long-time asymptotic forms, we can see that the velocity V1 is the rate at which the contribution of k3 travels away from the forcing location. The same is true for V2 and k0, V3 and k1, and V4 and k2. As \u03c9 f is increased towards the critical frequency, the contributions from k2 and k3 propagate faster through the domain, and those of k0 and k1 propagate more slowly. Above the critical frequency, the contributions of k0 and k1 decay in time, and are therefore not relevant to the bounding amplitudes. See Figs. 3 and 4 for the pole structure on either side of \u03c9c.\nThrough the inspection of (15c) and (15d), we see that the bounding amplitudes of regions B2 and C2 go to infinity (there is a (k0\u2212k1) in the denominators) and the widths go to zero (V2,V3\u2192 0) as \u03c9 f \u2192 \u03c9c from below. Due to the change in pole structure (k0 and k1 are coincident when \u03c9 f = \u03c9c (9d)) we did not perform the full asymptotic analysis for this threshold case. However,\n32\nwe did simulate results using the FSS (Appendix A 1) at the critical frequency. Although not shown here, the result appears to have a single algebraically growing peak at V = 0. The behavior predicted in Fig. 18 as \u03c9 f \u2192 \u03c9c from below is consistent with that from the FSS. The infinite bounding amplitude corresponds to the peak growing without bound."

            "text": "We now comment on differences between the signaling response from operators that enable exponential growth (Fig. 1) and those that only admit algebraically growing solutions (Figs. 9 and 17). In an exponentially unstable system, the bounding envelope for the transient corresponds to V\u2212 and V+ in Fig. 1. These correspond precisely to the velocities at which the rate of exponential growth is equal to zero, and there is a continuous locus of growing amplitudes for V \u2208 [V\u2212,V+]. In the algebraically growing system, there is only one velocity, V = c, at which long-time growth can occur (see Figs. 9 and 17). The interaction between transient and forced responses is significantly altered; instead of a broad region of competition between growing forced and transient responses even at large times, there are only large regions of constant amplitude that expand away from the source with time in accordance with the bounding critical velocities. Additionally, the speed VE in Fig. 1 is not present in algebraically growing systems, as this corresponds to the velocity at which the arguments of exponential growth of the transient are equal to that of the transient. There is no relevant analogous speed in the algebraically growing system. Note, however, that there is a direct relationship between exponential and algebraic signaling for the velocity VI in Fig. 1 with those in this paper. Just as with VI , all the critical velocities (V1 through V4) in the neutrally stable response correspond to locations where the influence of poles (arising from the oscillatory forcing) in the Fourier integral changes. This corresponds to their inclusion in contours used to evaluate the integrals at large time.\nWhile classical stability analysis (5) fails to classify the behavior of the convective (i.e., c 6= 0) transients in solutions to (8), it correctly predicts that there is no growth or decay in the longtime response of (8) for any given x (V approaches 0). This is an intriguing result because the transient behavior arises from the homogeneous solution to which classical stability analysis is applied. The signaling response of (8) has both upstream and downstream effects of forcing as time goes to infinity (see the long-time forced regions of Section IV A 5). The effects neither grow nor decay in space and thus, given enough time, the effects of the forcing will affect the\n33\nwhole domain with constant amplitude oscillations. This behavior is unlike that of an exponential signaling problem11, where the forced solution either grows or decays in space at large times. That said, there is an upstream and downstream behavior present in both algebraic and exponentially growing systems induced by the forcing."

            "text": "The oscillatory forcing of varicose waves in a thin planar inviscid liquid sheet (and in the work of10\u201312) at neutral stability leads to a transient growing peak and a long-time oscillatory response. We find that the behavior of the transient solution is highly dependent on how the disturbance is initiated. Only certain phases of the forcing function lead to an algebraically growing peak in the response. This dependence on initial condition is analogous to the findings of King et al.8, where only forcing the initial surface velocity leads to algebraic growth. The bounding amplitudes and critical velocities, which characterize the oscillatory response, can be extracted from the long-time asymptotic analysis of the Fourier integral solution; specifically, the amplitudes are extracted from the long-time asymptotic solution as the sum of multiple sinusoids and the critical velocities are extracted from the coincidence of a pole from the particular solution and a saddle point from the method of steepest descent. We find that there is a significant change in structure for forcing frequencies above and below a critical forcing frequency. The signaling response travels both upstream and downstream from the disturbed location. This behavior, combined with the spatial invariance within the regions, means that the disturbance will affect the entire domain after a sufficiently long time. From a manufacturing perspective, the system is vulnerable to such disturbances, as the damage to the product will not be localized."

            "text": "A key issue with the implementation of the long-time asymptotic solutions given in equations (15) and (17) is the resolution of high frequency sinusoids. An important distinction to make first is that the spatial resolution discussed here is entirely separate from how many terms are included in the FSS. Spatial resolution here refers to how many data points are sampled over a given V domain. While the values of the step size in V could be tested manually, it is possible to approximate the required step size by examining the asymptotic solutions.\nTo explore this issue, we first suppose that the phase of the highest frequency exponential (in V ) from the long-time asymptotic solution, denoted generally as f , has some associated frequency\n36\nwhich is a function of time, \u03c9A(t), and some phase shift which may be a function of time, \u03c6(t), such that,\nf = ei(\u03c9A(t)V+\u03c6(t)). (A3)\nAs an example, for region C in Fig. 9, \u03c9A(t) = k2t and \u03c6(t) = i\u03c9 f t (extracted from the exponent in (15e)). For a fixed time, it follows that the mode given in (A3) has a wavelength of 2\u03c0/\u03c9A(t) in V . We may then choose the number of points in our FSS (Appendix A 1) such that the maximum value for the step size in V is, for instance,\n\u2206V = \u03c0\n10\u03c9A(t) . (A4)\nAs an example, the \u2206V needed to achieve this level of resolution for region C in Fig. 9 would be\n\u2206V(\u03c9 f<\u03c9c, Region C) = \u03c0\n10k2t =  B\u03c0 5 ( c\u2212 \u221a c2 +4B\u03c9 f )  1 t . (A5)\nNote that, as we look at increasingly longer times, a smaller step size in V is required to achieve the same resolution relative to the wave pattern. This is especially problematic as t \u2192 \u221e because \u2206V \u2192 0. As long as the same velocity points are sampled, however, the FSS (Appendix A 1) and the asymptotic solutions can be compared. However, if \u2206V is too large, oscillations in the solution will not be adequately resolved and the true solution structure will be obscured."

A preliminary contour is established in the complex k plane as shown in Fig. S19. The limits on the angles \u03b31 and \u03b32 (drawn in the figure) are chosen such that the contour integrals along the curved sections go to zero and the dotted line path in the figure corresponds to the path of the integral (C1b) as R\u2192 \u221e.\nThrough consideration of (S1), the contour angles, \u03b31 and \u03b32, are restricted to lie in the intervals [0,\u03c0/2] and [\u03c0,3\u03c0/2], as indicated in Fig. S19. When the contour angles are chosen to be \u03c0/4 and 5\u03c0/4, the integrals along the diagonal can be evaluated asymptotically as time goes to infinity using the method of steepest descent (see Fig. S20).\nS47\nFIG. S19. General form of a bow-tie contour. For some central point k\u2217, the angles \u03b3 are limited to (0, \u03c0/2)\nfor \u03b31 and to (\u03c0 , 3\u03c0/2) for \u03b32, so that the integrals along the curved sections, C3 and C5 go to zero as R goes to infinity. In this example, the pole k0 is contained within a contour, and the pole k1 is not. The integral along the real axis, the dotted yellow line, is the integral I1 as R goes to infinity. The inset figure shows the orientation of the contour in the complex k plane. Depending on the value of k\u2217, the origin lies somewhere\nalong the dotted yellow line. For the sake of demonstration, the \u03c9 f > \u03c9 f case is presented here using the pole structure in Fig. 4. In the case of \u03c9 f < \u03c9c, all the poles would lie on the dotted yellow line. Each lobe of the bow-tie is a closed subcontour where A =C2\u222aC3\u222aC4 (from i\u221e to k\u2217) and B =C5\u222aC1\u222aC4 (from k\u2217 to \u2212i\u221e).\nAs indicated in (C2), the saddle point is a function of V and is always real-valued. Thus, the contour in Fig. S20 will be shifted along the real axis for different velocities. In what follows, no distinction will be made between the locus of saddles and the real k axis as they are equivalent for this problem.\nThe complete contour in Fig. S20 is broken up into two closed sub-contours, A and B which are separately evaluated through Cauchy\u2019s residue theorem (see Fig. S20). As an example, we focus\nS48\nFIG. S20. An example bow-tie contour in the complex k plane. As R goes to infinity, contour sections C1 and C2 become the integral of interest, and contour sections C3 and C5 go to zero. The pole k0 is enclosed, and the pole k1 is not enclosed. The integral along the contour C4 can be evaluated asymptotically as time goes to infinity due to the choice of k\u2217 (Fig. S19) as the saddle point ks and the choice of the angles \u03b3 . The position of the saddle point ks is a function of velocity. Contour is depicted for V > c and \u03c9 f > \u03c9c. Varying V translates the contour along the real k axis. In the case of \u03c9 f < \u03c9c, all the poles would lie on the dotted yellow line. Each lobe of the bow-tie is a closed subcontour where A = C2 \u222aC3 \u222aC4 (from (1+ i)\u221e to k\u2217) and B =C5\u222aC1\u222aC4 (from k\u2217 to \u2212(1+ i)\u221e)\nhere on contour B of Fig. S20, shown in Fig. S21. Because the real axis segment of Fig. S20 is the integral of interest from k = \u2212\u221e to k = \u221e, it follows that the real axis segment of Fig. S21 is the integrand of interest integrated from k =\u2212\u221e to ks. Around the closed contour B in Fig. S21 the integral can be expressed with \u03b6 as a placeholder of the integrand as \u222b C1 \u03b6 dk+ \u222b C2 \u03b6 dk+ \u222b C3 \u03b6 dk = 2\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k0)+\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k2), (S3) where Res( f ,k j) is the residue of the integrand \u03b6 at the pole k j. The contained pole k0 has the full contribution, but the intersected pole k2 only has half the contribution. Also, this expression is only valid when k0 is contained (as it is in Fig. S21). For a larger velocity, the saddle point may be shifted far enough to the left such that k0 is no longer contained. Through the choice of \u03b32, the integral along C3 goes to zero as R\u2192 \u221e. Therefore, we can say that\u222b C1 \u03b6 dk = 2\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k0)+\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k2)\u2212 \u222b C2 \u03b6 dk. (S4)\nS49\nFIG. S21. Example integration contour B from Fig. S20. As before, the angle \u03b32 is chosen such that the integral along C3 goes to zero as R goes to infinity, the integral along C2 can be determined asymptotically as time goes to infinity, and the integral along the real axis (C1, dotted yellow line) is the integral of interest as R goes to infinity. For the sake of example, the pole k0 is contained in the contour and the pole k2 is intersected by the contour.\nEvaluating the residue of (S1) at the saddle points yields\nRes(\u03b6 ;k j) = lim k\u2192k j\n( \u2212\nA f B2\n( (k\u2212 k j)ei\u03a6t\n(k\u2212 k0)(k\u2212 k1)(k\u2212 k2)(k\u2212 k3)\n)) . (S5)\nThe contour along the diagonal contour, C2, is determined by converting the integral into polar form as k = ks + rei\u03b3 , dk = ei\u03b3dr. This transformation yields\u222b C2 \u03b6 dk = \u221e\u222b\n0\nei\u03b3\u03b6 (ks + rei\u03b3)dr, (S6)\n\u222b C2 \u03b6 dk = e i ( \u03b32\u2212 ( (V\u2212c)2t 4B ) \u2212\u03c9 f t )\n\u00d7 \u221e\u222b\n0\neiBr 2e2i\u03b3 tdr\n(rei\u03b32 + ks\u2212 k0)(rei\u03b32 + ks\u2212 k1)(rei\u03b32 + ks\u2212 k2)(rei\u03b32 + ks\u2212 k3) . (S7)\nS50\nNext, \u03b3 is chosen in order to put the exponent into the form of \u2212r2, \u03b3 = 5\u03c0/4.

Through integration by parts, the latter integral is asymptotically subdominant to the former. Over the small range 0 to \u03b5 the integral can be replaced with the integral linearized about r = 0. In order to evaluate the integral, \u03b5 is taken to infinity without adding any asymptotically dominant terms in accordance with the method of steepest descent. Doing so yields\u222b C2 \u03b6 dk \u223c e 5i\u03c0 4 e \u2212i ( (V\u2212c)2 4B +\u03c9 f ) t \u221e\u222b 0 e\u2212Br 2tdr (ks\u2212 k0)(ks\u2212 k1)(ks\u2212 k2)(ks\u2212 k3) as t\u2192 \u221e, (S9)\n\u222b C2\n\u03b6 dk \u223c \u2212e i\u03c0 4 e \u2212i ( (V\u2212c)2 4B +\u03c9 f ) t\n(ks\u2212 k0)(ks\u2212 k1)(ks\u2212 k2)(ks\u2212 k3) \u221e\u222b 0 e\u2212Br 2tdr as t\u2192 \u221e, (S10)\n\u222b C2\n\u03b6 dk \u223c \u2212e i\u03c0 4 e \u2212i ( (V\u2212c)2 4B +\u03c9 f ) t\n(ks\u2212 k0)(ks\u2212 k1)(ks\u2212 k2)(ks\u2212 k3)\n\u221a \u03c0\n4Bt as t\u2192 \u221e.

(S2)\nNext we establish a half-plane contour in either the upper half-plane or lower-half plane depending on the sign of V .\nFIG. S22. Sample half-plane contour for (C1c) for V > 0 and \u03c9 f > \u03c9c. The poles k1 is contained and the poles k2 and k3 are intersected. See (9d) for the definitions of the poles. The integral along the curved contour goes to zero as R goes to infinity.\nThe integral (C1c) is expressed as\n\u222e (A f B2\nei\u03a6t (k\u2212 k0)(k\u2212 k1)(k\u2212 k2)(k\u2212 k3) dk )\n= \u222b\nC1\n( A f B2\nei\u03a6t (k\u2212 k0)(k\u2212 k1)(k\u2212 k2)(k\u2212 k3) dk ) + \u222b C2 ( A f B2\nei\u03a6t (k\u2212 k0)(k\u2212 k1)(k\u2212 k2)(k\u2212 k3) dk )\n= 2\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k1)+\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k2)+\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k3), (S3)\nS52\nwhere \u03b6 is a placeholder for the integrand of (C1c). We note that, because V > 0 and the contour is in the upper half-plane, the integral along C2 goes to zero as R goes to infinity. Additionally, the integral along C1 becomes J2 under the same limit, yielding\nJ2 = 2\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k1)+\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k2)+\u03c0iRes(\u03b6 ,k3), (S4)\nRes(\u03b6 ;k j) = lim k\u2192k j\n( \u2212\nA f B2\n( (k\u2212 k j)ei(\u03c9 f+kV )t\n(k\u2212 k0)(k\u2212 k1)(k\u2212 k2)(k\u2212 k3)\n)) . (S5)\nNote that if V < 0 then the contour must be established in the lower half-plane, so k0 would be contained instead of k1. If \u03c9 f < \u03c9c, all the poles lie on the real axis and the choice of direction for the contour has no effect on which poles are contained. The result (S4) is the desired exact result for J2 used in the asymptotic results (D1) and (D9).\nS53"
