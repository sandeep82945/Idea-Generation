We accessed data through the AoURP Research Workbench (https://www.researchallofus.org/datatools/workbench/).6 We included all adults (\u2265 18 years) who self-identified as Hispanic, NHWs, and/or Black (non-Hispanic). CVD was determined using electronic health records (EHR) based on AoURP hierarchical grouping using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/thecommon-data-model/). The list was further refined by having two investigators (RMV, OC) review each diagnosis code and excluding a small number which were not relevant, e.g.,\nvenous disease (list available from corresponding author). We report results stratified by age and gender, using 95% confidence intervals (CI). Age-adjusted CVD rates were calculated in males and females using direct standardization with the AoURP cohort as the standard population. All analyses were done using R environment (\u00a9RFoundation, www.r-project.org/)."

The crude CVD prevalence was higher in men than women and increased with age. After age adjustment, we found that Latina women had a crude CVD rate of 6.1% (95%CI [6.0, 6.2]). This rate was higher than NHW women (3.9%, 95%CI [3.8, 4.0]) but lower than Black women (7.7%, 95%CI [7.5, 7.8]). The age-adjusted CVD rate was highest among Latino men at 9.2% (95%CI [9.0, 9.4]) versus black at 8.1% (95%CI [7.9,8.2]) and NHW men at 7.6% (95%CI [7.4, 7.8]) (Fig. 1)."

            "text": "Prior data suggesting Latino people have lower rates of CVD than NHWs had been considered paradoxical. In our analysis, they had significantly higher age-adjusted CVD rates than NHW individuals. These findings do not support the Latino Epidemiologic Paradox. Strengths of our study include the size and diversity of the cohort. With over 40,000 Latino enrollees, AoURP is the largest cohort of Latino people in the United States. By recruiting across a large swath of geographically distinct sites, it includes a wide spectrum of Hispanic subgroups. However, the cohort was not designed using a nationally representative sampling frame. We also age standardized to the AoURP distribution, and prevalence rates may not be fully comparable to those in other studies. In addition, we utilized EHR diagnoses for CVD. Prior work has shown this approach has fair to good validity for heart disease. In addition, our data using EHR diagnoses is comparable to self-reported data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey which finds a CVD prevalence for NHWs at 8.7%1 versus 7.6% in our analysis. Additional research should continue to examine how CVD varies across Latino subgroups and the roles of other factors Received December 28, 2021 Accepted April 15, 2022 Published online May 3, 2022\n4013\nsuch as immigration and acculturation. These variables are currently being collected but not yet publicly available for analysis. Once AoURP makes genetic data available, researchers will also be able to examine the role of both global ancestral alleles and those closer to more local CVD risk loci. In addition, while this paradox has been best described in CVD, it is also evident in other health conditions such as cancer and infant mortality. Regardless of the existence of this paradox, CVD remains a leading cause of death among Latinos. This, along with our findings, further supports ongoing tailored initiatives to control CVD risk factors among Latinos.\nAcknowledgements: This study was supported by the All of Us Research Program\u2019s grants.
