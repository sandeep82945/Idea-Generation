    "abstractText": "Introduction: A singer\u2019s or speaker\u2019s Fach (voice type) should be appraised based on acoustic cues characterizing their voice. Instead, in practice, it is often influenced by the individual\u2019s physical appearance. This is especially distressful for transgender people who may be excluded from formal singing because of perceived mismatch between their voice and appearance. To eventually break down these visual biases, we need a better understanding of the conditions under which they occur. Specifically, we hypothesized that trans listeners (not actors) would be better able to resist such biases, relative to cis listeners, precisely because they would be more aware of appearance-voice dissociations.",

D.\u00a0Deroche\nLaboratory for Hearing and Cognition, Psychology Department, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada\nIntroduction: A singer\u2019s or speaker\u2019s Fach (voice type) should be\u00a0 appraised based on acoustic cues characterizing their voice. Instead, in practice, it is often influenced by the individual\u2019s physical appearance. This is especially distressful for transgender people who may be\u00a0excluded from formal singing because of perceived mismatch between their voice and appearance. To eventually break down these visual biases, we\u00a0 need a better understanding of the conditions under which they occur. Specifically, we\u00a0hypothesized that trans listeners (not actors) would be\u00a0better able to resist such biases, relative to cis listeners, precisely because they would be\u00a0more aware of appearance-voice dissociations.\nMethods: In an online study, 85 cisgender and 81 transgender participants were presented with 18 different actors singing or speaking short sentences. These actors covered six voice categories from high/bright (traditionally feminine) to low/dark (traditionally masculine) voices: namely soprano, mezzo-soprano (referred to henceforth as mezzo), contralto (referred to henceforth as alto), tenor, baritone, and bass. Every participant provided voice type ratings for (1) Audio-only (A) stimuli to get an unbiased estimate of a given actor\u2019s voice type, (2) Video-only (V) stimuli to get an estimate of the strength of the bias itself, and (3) combined Audio-Visual (AV) stimuli to see how much visual cues would affect the evaluation of the audio.\nResults: Results demonstrated that visual biases are not subtle and hold across the entire scale, shifting voice appraisal by about a third of the distance between adjacent voice types (for example, a third of the bass-to-baritone distance). This shift was 30% smaller for trans than for cis listeners, confirming our main hypothesis. This pattern was largely similar whether actors sung or spoke, though singing overall led to more feminine/high/bright ratings.\nConclusion: This study is one of the first demonstrations that transgender listeners are in fact better judges of a singer\u2019s or speaker\u2019s voice type because they are better able to separate the actors\u2019 voice from their appearance, a finding that opens exciting avenues to fight more generally against implicit (or sometimes explicit) biases in voice appraisal.\nKEYWORDS\naudio-visual integration, FACH, gender studies, implicit bias, trans voice, voice timbre\n1. Introduction\nIn principle, our perception of a speaker\u2019s or singer\u2019s vocal range and Fach (or voice category) should rely primarily (if not exclusively) on auditory cues. Yet, in practice, many other cues may be\u00a0considered, such as the actor\u2019s facial features, height, body size or shape, and potentially, skin color, opening the door to several biases, both unconscious and, in certain circumstances, conscious."

The Fach system\nFach (the literal translation of which is \u201ccompartment\u201d or \u201csubject\u201d but in this context could be\u00a0 taken to mean \u201cspecialty\u201d) is a categorization system for voices created in Germany, for the practical purpose of contracting singers for entire opera seasons at a time. In this way, companies could ensure they had the appropriate singers to produce several operas each year and singers/actors could ensure they would not be\u00a0asked to sing roles that could harm their voices. The system is extremely finicky and now has over 25 categories. These include the large categories of bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, soprano, as well as the large category of countertenor (generally indicating a cisgender man singing in the treble range and not included in this paper). Within the Fach System, there are further divisions of each category into subcategories such as coloratura, lyric, dramatic and more. According to McGinnis, \u201cThere are many factors that determine a singer\u2019s Fach. These include the singer\u2019s basic vocal equipment, combined with his or her physical appearance, age, and experience\u201d (McGinnis, 2010). Overall range, comfortable tessitura (the part of the range in which a singer is most comfortable singing most of the time), size of voice, timbre (often defined as tone colour or sound quality), and level of development are part of Fach determination. McGinnis maintains that personality and acting ability play a role in Fach determination and, most questionably, physical appearance. She states that large voices do not (or rarely) come in small bodies, etc. These points are important because while an actor may be\u00a0 attracted to dramatic characters, if they do not possess a sizeable voice with a very particular timbre, they would injure themselves singing these roles. However, her theory that big voices only come in big bodies (and conversely small and high voices only come in small bodies) has been subject to criticism (Cotton, 2012).\nIt is important to mention that all children, prior to the onset of puberty, have vocal apparatuses of similar size and shape. Both testosterone- and estrogen-dominant puberties affect the size of the vocal folds and larynx to different extents: testosterone-dominant puberties generally result in longer and thicker vocal folds as well as a longer vocal tract and bigger larynx than do estrogen-dominant ones. People of all sexes develop a laryngeal prominence (also called Adam\u2019s Apple), as the larynx, which begins as separate, flexible cartilages, descends, fuses, and begins to ossify (Doscher, 1994; Abitbol et\u00a0al., 1999; Pomfret, 2012; Prakash and Johnny, 2015). The length of the vocal folds contributes to vocal range (frequencies attainable by the singer or speaker), while thickness contributes to vocal weight (how light/lyric or heavy/dramatic the voice is perceived). Vowel formants are partly determined by the length of the vocal tract, with less spacing between formants producing a sound typically associated with cisgender men\u2019s speaking voices (longer vocal tract) and more spaced-out formants producing a sound typically associated with cisgender women\u2019s speaking voices (shorter vocal tract; Sundberg, 1987; Bozeman, 2013; Block et\u00a0al., 2018; Hirsch et\u00a0al., 2018).\nExogenous testosterone, often taken by trans masculine people after they have undergone an estrogen-dominant puberty, usually results in some lengthening and/or thickening of the vocal folds (though how much is unpredictable), but because the larynx of an adult has already begun the ossification process, the larynx itself generally will not grow. Likewise, an adult who begins a course of testosterone therapy will generally not get taller or develop a longer vocal tract (Agha and Hynes, 2022). While vocal pitch might change with testosterone therapy alone,\nmany physical elements affecting voice quality will not. Trans women who begin exogenous estrogen therapy will typically not experience any further changes to the voice or vocal anatomy (Gromko and Hatfield, 2018; Loutrari and Georgiadou, 2022). This implies that certain physical attributes are not easily changed by exogenous sex hormone modulations in adulthood and could cue a listener toward features of the voice, in line with McGinnis\u2019s view. Still, other hormones appear to affect the voice: e.g., Rendall et\u00a0al. (2005) found that higher levels of cortisol, in men, raised their fundamental frequency (F0), even in those with high levels of testosterone.\nOther evidence also seems to support the idea that physical factors can inform about features of the voice. For example, neck, waist, chest circumference, weight, or height (but to a smaller degree) might correlate with the F0 of a person\u2019s speaking voice, with larger bodily dimensions predicting lower F0s (Evans et\u00a0al., 2006; Pawelec et\u00a0al., 2020). Strikingly, this phenomenon is not only true across individuals of different body types but holds within the same person at different weights: de Souza and dos Santos (2018) focused on obesity in women, finding that after bariatric surgery and weight loss, women\u2019s F0s increased by approximately one semitone and their maximum phonation time increased to match that of a control group of women of normal weight. However, such links (between characteristics of the body and of the voice) are often erroneous. For example, in Van Dommelen and Moxness (1995), listeners did indeed consistently estimate speaker height and weight by relying on the speakers\u2019 F0, vocal tract length/formant spacing, and articulation, but their estimates were not usually correct. Cisgender male listeners (but not cisgender female listeners) tended to accurately judge the height and weight of other cisgender male speakers but neither group of listeners was accurate in their estimates of cisgender female speakers\u2019 bodily dimensions. Similarly, Rendall et\u00a0al. (2005) found that the relatively large difference in habitual speaking F0 between cisgender men and women did not correlate strictly to differences in body size. As the relationship between body size and F0 seems multifactorial, researchers have looked for other factors that could influence F0 production. Rendall et\u00a0al. (2005) proposed that vocal fold length was the primary physiological factor behind the large difference in F0 between the speech of cis men and women. Other factors included vocal fold thickness and density, but these have long been contested (Titze, 1989). Finally, they suggested that the adoption of a lower F0 may also be\u00a0a behavioral choice to advertise a larger body size than the speaker possesses. This latter reason departs from physiology and turns to psychosocial factors. In this vein, Puts et\u00a0al. (2012) found that lower F0s in men corresponded to increased confidence and aggression, pointing to personality traits. A lack of clear relationship to body dimension is also found for acoustic parameters affecting voice timbre. Height and neck, chest, and/or waist circumference may be\u00a0a predictor of formant position and spacing (Rendall et\u00a0al., 2005). Taller (and to a smaller degree, larger) men had darker voices, but the same was not true for women. Ohala (1994) argues that sexual dimorphism in the vocal apparatus occurs in humans around puberty. This manifests in testosterone-dominant puberties as (1) an increase in length and change in texture of the vocal folds and a resultant lowering of the F0 and (2) an increase in the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the vocal tract, resulting in a different formant spacing and sympathetic vibrations, thus producing a rougher vocal timbre. These collectively signal larger size, increased aggression, and greater sexual prowess. While this is seen across species and is likely the aural equivalent of the lion\u2019s mane or the human male\u2019s\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nbeard (it makes them seem bigger), Rendall et\u00a0al. (2005) and Pisanski et\u00a0 al. (2016) claim that men in our culture sometimes create even bigger, darker, lower voices than their anatomy would suggest to signal dominance; similarly, women sometimes raise their F0 and increase formant spacing to appear more youthful, feminine, or submissive, while lowering their pitch when they want appear professional, qualified, and independent (Oakley, 2000; Pisanski et\u00a0 al., 2018). Amazingly, such dimorphism may be\u00a0 seen even in childhood as children as young as 6 are capable of imitating masculine and feminine sounds, despite there being no difference in their vocal anatomy (Cartei et\u00a0al., 2019). This suggests that the dimorphism we\u00a0perceive when evaluating gender is in part physical but in part manufactured through cultural habituation.\nTo summarize, there are physical/biological factors that can influence voice pitch and voice timbre and would support the conception that low/dark voices come in big bodies. Although these findings are interesting, the studies suffer generally from a sample size that is either not sufficiently large or sufficiently diverse to generalize across the entire human population. For example, the study by Pawelec et\u00a0al. (2020) includes only young men, aged 18\u201333 from two cities in Poland, showing a lack of diversity; that by Evans et\u00a0al. (2006) includes only heterosexual, English-speaking men, again showing a lack of diversity; and that by de Souza et\u00a0al. (2018) involved only 25 morbidly obese participants. Additionally, while there may be\u00a0average differences in voice types affected by certain biological factors, there is a lot of individual variability, and it should be\u00a0 more important to find a person\u2019s healthy vocal Fach than to make them conform to what the average \u201cshould\u201d be. There is no need to search for outliers to find famous exceptions to the idea advanced by McGinnis. One need only consider the voices of Luciano Pavarotti, a man of considerable height and weight with a high lyric tenor voice, and Joan Sutherland, a coloratura soprano who sang the highest operatic roles and stood nearly 6 feet tall. The authors would propose instead that society prefers or is accustomed to seeing big and tall actors portray heroic characters and these roles are generally composed for big, dramatic voices. In contrast, small and young-looking actors play romantic leads, and these roles are generally composed for light, high, flexible voices. Very young children have been shown to perceive stereotypical masculinity and femininity in the voice but more fascinatingly, as of the age of 6, children also learn to alter their F0 and vowel formant spacing to masculinize or feminize their voices when imitating stereotypically masculine or feminine characters, although no dimorphic anatomical sex differences in vocal anatomy are present in children prior to age 11. Children have also been shown to make stereotypically masculine or feminine sentence choices based on their audience\u2019s perceived gender (Cartei et\u00a0 al., 2019, 2021a,b). This dependency on the receiver characteristics suggests a particular purpose in modulating one\u2019s voice to match listeners\u2019 expectation of pitch and timbre. Those who have the desired voice-body \u201cmatch\u201d are the people most often cast, thus reinforcing the erroneous belief that big voices come in big bodies and small voices come in small bodies. This, in effect, is the heart of the bias in voice appraisal which we\u00a0address in this study."

These can be\u00a0dissimilar to one\u2019s conscious or explicit biases, meaning one can consciously support the rights of a certain group of people while still holding ingrained, unconscious, or buried biases against that group. It is, therefore, crucial to raise awareness about implicit biases so that we\u00a0can act to correct our behaviours and be\u00a0more inclusive (Boscardin, 2015; Staats, 2015; De Houwer, 2019).\nGroup singing has been shown to have mental health benefits (Clift and Morrison, 2011; Dubinsky et al., 2017; Pullinger, 2020). Unfortunately, transgender people experience exclusion from formal singing due to implicit biases surrounding perceived voice-body mismatches (Janssen, 2018; Eidsheim and Whelden, 2019/2021; Pullinger, 2020) and this also affects cisgender singers whose voices fall outside the traditional women with high voice and small body versus men with low voice and large body dichotomy. Additionally, there are issues of everyday health and safety for transgender people, who fear outing themselves when speaking in public (Oates and Dacakis, 2015; Jackson Hearns and Kremer, 2018; Mills and Stoneham, 2020; Quinn et\u00a0al., 2022). Thus, we\u00a0expect the transgender population to be\u00a0especially aware of voice-body \u201cmismatches,\u201d and possibly resist them better."

            "heading": "1.3. Multimodal basis of these visual biases in voice appraisal",
            "text": "The way the brain perceives gender must integrate different modalities. This multimodal aspect is echoed in the work of Peynircio\u01e7lu et\u00a0al. (2017), Brang (2019), and Abbatecola et\u00a0al. (2021), who all designed experiments modeled on either McGurk effect or Ventriloquist effect to investigate auditory\u2013visual interactions in voice/face gender perception. As a reminder, the McGurk effect is an illusion caused by multimodal integration in which the auditory element of one stimulus (e.g., the spoken syllable \u201cba\u201d) is merged with the visual element of a second stimulus (e.g., the lip movement of \u201cga\u201d), leading to the perception of an intermediate stimulus (e.g., \u201cda\u201d) which was never presented. The Ventriloquist effect is another illusion in which visual information about the spatial localization of a sound source takes precedence over the spatial cues contained within the auditory information. These illusions can be\u00a0leveraged to reveal biases in voice appraisal. In the study by Peynircio\u01e7lu et\u00a0al. (2017), listeners were first presented with audio-only versions of mezzo and baritone singers sustaining a G3 (F0 of 196 Hz). A subgroup of the participants who scored 100% in gender identification of these (purely auditory) voices (noting that authors presumed that an identification of soprano or alto equalled \u201cwoman\u201d and an identification of tenor or bass equalled \u201cman\u201d) was then presented with mismatched audio-visual stimuli. For example, a cis woman\u2019s face was paired with a cis man\u2019s voice or a cis man\u2019s face with a cis woman\u2019s voice. The participants\u2019 ability to identify the gender of the singers decreased from 100 to 31%. Despite certain limitations (largely methodological in nature), this study had the merit to demonstrate the strength of visual information even for listeners who were operationalized (by the experimenters\u2019 collapse of the traditional male and female categories into binary distinctions) to appear like they had strict binary views.\nSimilar cross-modal interactions can be\u00a0found in the world of music research (Deutsch, 2019). Schutz extensively investigated the role of percussionists\u2019 gestures on listeners\u2019 perception of temporal material (Schutz and Kubovy, 2006, 2009; Schutz and Lipscomb, 2007; Schutz and Manning, 2012). Participants were shown videos of percussionists playing different notes and asked to determine whether\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nthe notes were long/sustained or short/staccato. Impressively, all listeners (even the percussionists themselves) could be\u00a0fooled into believing that notes accompanied by sustained gestures were long, while notes accompanied by the staccato gestures were short, although both videos contained the same audio signal. Note that these crossmodal interactions are not always deceiving. Often, cross-modal interactions exist to support each other. For example, violinists find the sound of their instrument richer when they feel its vibrations as they play than when they hear an audio-only recording of the same note being played (Wollman et\u00a0al., 2014; Saitis et\u00a0al., 2017). Singers\u2019 gestures and facial expressions enhanced listeners\u2019 abilities to perceive key changes and emotional meaning in songs (Thompson et\u00a0al., 2010). In linguistics, cross-modal interactions with facial cues are very common indeed: Strand and Johnson (1996) and Strand (1999) found evidence that the boundary for hearing [\u0283], as in shape (with more energy in the lower part of the spectrum and therefore considered to be\u00a0a more masculine sound), versus [s], as in sad (with more energy in the higher part of the spectrum and therefore considered to be\u00a0a more feminine sound) changes for listeners when viewing a masculine or a feminine face speaking.\nTo summarize, the brain must integrate information from different senses to make a coherent model of the world, but in doing so, it irremediably leads people to make auditory judgments biased by visual cues, and visual judgments biased by auditory cues. In many circumstances, this AV binding is helpful, but it is important to recognize that it is the root cause of the implicit biases aforementioned."

            "text": "If we\u00a0are to break down biases in voice assessment to create a more equitable environment for speakers and singers regardless of their physical appearance, we\u00a0first need to explore the conditions under which they occur and provide empirical data to characterize the magnitude and dependency of the biases. On the listener\u2019s side, it could very well be\u00a0that some individuals are particularly susceptible or particularly resistant to these biases. We\u00a0 reasoned that trans listeners would have some immunity to these biases compared to cis listeners precisely because they are \u201ctrained\u201d through their life experience to dissociate voice from appearance. On the singer\u2019s side, it could very well be\u00a0that altos and tenors suffer less from these biases because they are in the middle of the voice range and so perhaps more versatile (to accommodate for unexpected appearance). Following this reasoning, basses and sopranos might suffer the most from these biases.\nTo address these research questions, we\u00a0presented participants with three sets of stimuli of the same 18 actors (who were either speaking or singing) in Audio-only modality (A), Video-only modality (V), and Audio and Visual together (AV) to assess how their ratings of the actor\u2019s voice would change along the gender spectrum after seeing the actor\u2019s face. The 18 actors had vocal types ranging from bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, or soprano. Participants were taught through a short tutorial what each of these six voice types sounded like (each with spoken and with sung examples). More importantly, we\u00a0 recruited both cisgender and transgender/nonbinary adults. Because transgender and nonbinary listeners are likely to be\u00a0more aware of the dissociation between a person\u2019s appearance and their\nvocal characteristics, we\u00a0hypothesized that these listeners would resist (in comparison with cis listeners) the influence of visual cues taken from an actor\u2019s face and body type, and thus provide more consistent ratings across A and AV stimuli.\nIn addition to this main hypothesis, we\u00a0 explored a few extra parameters, but we\u00a0 did not have strong expectations into their respective roles. (1) We\u00a0speculated that biases could differ across the human range, and perhaps affect voices on the extremities more strongly (e.g., because the face/body expectations of a bass or a soprano would be\u00a0further away from the norm). (2) We\u00a0reasoned that a voice would be\u00a0easier to judge when pushed outside of its daily use\u00a0such as when singing versus speaking\u00a0- but whether this would lead to stronger weights on auditory versus visual cues (i.e., smaller biases) was largely an open question. (3) Along the same lines, we\u00a0reasoned that an emotional stimulus (happy or sad utterance) would provide a better glimpse of voice characteristics than a stimulus produced in a neutral manner, but whether this would lead to differential use of auditory and visual cues was again an open question. (4) Finally, we\u00a0hoped that the semantic content of the sentences being spoken or sung would have negligible effect on the phenomenon observed in this case."

Note that within the present TRANS group, there is a diverse community of four sub-groups: transgender men, transgender women, non-binary people assigned male at birth (NB-AMAB), and non-binary people assigned female at birth (NB-AFAB). For clarity, we\u00a0limited the discussion in the body of the paper to the two umbrella groups of TRANS and CIS.\nA total of 157 had either technical difficulties or did not complete the full study; mostly because the AV materials easily took 15 min to download, which deterred some of these participants before they even began. These (incomplete) files were excluded from any analysis, resulting in 85 participants in the cisgender (CIS) group (37 women and 48 men) and 81 participants in the transgender (TRANS) group (10 trans women, 16 trans men, 37 NB-AFAB individuals, and 18 NB-AMAB individuals). This CIS/TRANS factor was referred to as gender (not sex).

The RAVDESS is comprised of 7,356 files of 24 professional actors singing and speaking two phrases: \u201cdogs are sitting by the door\u201d and \u201ckids are talking by the door.\u201d The emotions portrayed in the speech samples are happy, calm, sad, angry, fearful, surprised, and disgusted. Emotions portrayed in the sung samples are happy, calm, sad, angry, and fearful. Phrases were delivered at normal and strong levels of emotional intensity. Each sample exists in a V version (no sound), an A version (16-bit, 48 kHz), and a combined AV version (720p H.264, AAC 48 kHz, .mp4).1\nOf the 24 actors in the RAVDESS corpus, 18 were chosen for inclusion in the study because their voices were judged to fit within the six large categories of the German Fach System of voice classification. This evaluation was done by first author JMK, relying on their extensive background in opera performance and vocal pedagogy as well as their training in timbre studies. The six categories are (from low/dark to high/bright): bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, soprano. Traditionally, (cisgender) women have been placed in the three highest categories while (cisgender) men have typically been placed in the three lower categories. Note that for this study, the category of countertenor voice, or (cisgender) male treble, was not\n1 See https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.ZEpP9uzML0o\nincluded because no countertenor voices were represented in the RAVDESS corpus.\nUncomfortable as it may be, we\u00a0also sought to investigate whether certain actors (because of their appearance) would be\u00a0more affected by listener bias than others, depending on whether they were a visual match for their Fach. The determination of voice-body match or mismatch was made based on JMK\u2019s knowledge and experience with casting trends using heuristics rules that are questionable but often relied upon. No objective validation of this classification is available (nor was it critical for our primary aim) but sources such as blogs and magazine articles depict examples of voice-body mismatch that we\u00a0encountered and that continue to be\u00a0problematic for auditioning opera singers (McNeil, 2015; Salsbery Fry, 2018; By Voice Alone, 2019; Hahn, 2021). Three actors were chosen in each category, whose face/ body size and shape were presumed to indicate an upward mismatch (i.e., whose voice sounded lower/darker than their physical appearance suggested), a downward mismatch (i.e., whose voice sounded higher/ brighter than their physical appearance suggested), or a match. This factor was referred to as appearance direction.\nAlthough voice emotion was not the focus of the present study, we\u00a0reasoned that a voice might perhaps be\u00a0better evaluated when pushed to its extreme, i.e., when the actor was instructed to sing rather speak, and when instructed to enact a high-intensity emotion rather than a neutral emotion. These two variables were designed in an orthogonal manner such that there was an equal number of spoken and sung stimuli (referred to as mode), and within each mode there was an equal number of neutral and emotional stimuli (referred to as emotional intensity). Note that only the happy or sad versions of the recordings were chosen for the emotional condition, and specifically those enacted with high emotional intensity in an attempt to enhance the emotional contrast. Finally, there was an equal representation of the two sentences, in each combination of emotional intensity and mode. This resulted in 18 actors \u00d7 2 modes \u00d7 2 emotional intensities \u00d7 2\nFIGURE\u00a01 Demographics of the two groups of participants, split by sub-type of gender identity (top left), age at time of testing (top right), student status (bottom left) and geographical origin (bottom right).\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nitems = 144 AV recordings.

Then, participants answered a 20-question survey on gender views (see Supplementary material 5; Tezare, 2015).\nParticipants first completed a short tutorial in which they were exposed a single time to the 6 voice types in the study (bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, soprano) with A-only stimuli (same actors but different samples from those used in the test, both spoken and sung). They were told the correct category and instructed how to move the slider along the line, representing a spectrum from low/dark (bass) to high/bright (soprano) voices with labels underneath. By showing the voice types on a continuous spectrum, we\u00a0 hoped to discourage participants from making binary judgments about the speaker\u2019s or singer\u2019s gender and encourage them to think of voices in terms of pitch/timbre continuums.\nHaving completed this tutorial (where no subject was ever excluded based on their performance in this tutorial because the task was not intended as a test), participants proceeded to the experiment. In phase 1 of the study, participants judged all 144 A-only stimuli by moving a slider along the low/dark-high/bright continuum. In phase 2 of the study, participants were asked to again move the slider but this time they viewed silent videos of the same recordings they had rated in phase 1 (V-only). Finally, in phase 3 of the study, participants were presented with the full AV versions of the same 18 actors and reported their voice appraisal on the same low/dark-high/bright continuum. Critically, our analysis focused on comparing ratings between modalities, and as such there was no correct or incorrect response. Our goal was not to measure how accurate participants were at allocating a voice type to a given actor but to assess how their ratings would change once they saw the actor. The order of the 144 stimuli was shuffled randomly for each block and each participant, but the order of blocks was always A, then V, then AV. This was meant to prevent the possibility of pairing the audio with visual information on a given actor while still completing single-modality ratings (which would arguably have reduced the bias we\u00a0intended to observe). Before exiting the online interface, participants were asked to provide feedback on five questions pertaining to possible technical difficulties, the amount of mental effort in completing the task, clarity of the instructions and extent of the practice, goal of the study, and whether they noticed anything special with the stimuli. No data from these questions is reported here because they did not raise any finding or concerns.

In other words, we\u00a0were interested in the AV \u2013 A difference, and specifically whether it went in the direction of the V \u2013 A difference. As an example, a participant could give a rating of 5.8 when listening to the soprano actor in Figure\u00a02, but\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nwhen seeing the actor in question, they might give a rating of 4.8 (because their appearance would somehow suggest a darker/lower voice). When watching the full AV material, this participant might respond somewhere between their A and V ratings, perhaps giving a rating of 5.6. Thus, compared to their original A rating, they would have shifted by 0.2\u00a0in the direction suggested by the visual cues. This shift was the key dependent variable of this study.\nOne might intuitively think that the larger the mismatch between A and V ratings, the larger the AV shift might be, and thus one might wish to express it as a percentage of the V shift. Unfortunately, as this analysis was done for every single item in a paired fashion, there were many instances where the A and V rating could be\u00a0very close to one another (and in fact sometimes identical), leading to disproportionately large proportional AV shifts (sometimes infinite). Instead, we\u00a0opted to use the raw values, with the only manipulation being to multiply the (AV \u2013 A) difference by the sign of the (V \u2013 A) difference, to standardize the AV shift in a consistent direction (i.e., toward the visual bias \u2013 for positive values\u00a0- or away from the visual bias \u2013 for negative values). As with single modality ratings, a rm-ANOVA corroborated by bootstrapped estimates of the important means and their 95% confidence intervals was conducted on the (signed) AV-A shift, with the same three factors (gender, voice category, and mode). Note that we\u00a0also analyzed the V \u2013 A metric and the results were consistent with findings observed in each modality, so we\u00a0did not report it here to avoid redundancy.\nTwo additional analyses were conducted on the (signed) AV-A shifts. The first focused on their correlation with the participants\u2019 gender views. Linear regressions were performed between each person\u2019s average score from the gender views questionnaire and their average AV shift. This was done for each of the six categories separately. The second additional analysis attempted to split the AV shifts going upwards versus those going downwards to examine whether there could be\u00a0some directionality effect in the size of the bias observed. To this aim, we\u00a0replaced mode by appearance direction in the rm-ANOVA."

Bootstrapped estimates were 1.932\nFIGURE\u00a03 Scores obtained by cis (red) and trans (blue) participants in the questionnaire evaluating gender views, with means and standard errors in each population (left panel).

Error bars show one standard error from the mean.\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\n[1.869\u20132.019] for bass, 2.579 [2.520\u20132.653] for baritone, 2.814 [2.754\u20132.885] for tenor, 4.589 [4.527\u20134.652] for alto, 4.778 [4.711\u2013 4.838] for mezzo, and 5.220 [5.131\u20135.292] for soprano. A gap is notable between the bottom three (traditionally male) and the top three (traditionally female) categories. There was a main effect of mode [F(1,164) = 266.3, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.013] reflecting higher ratings in sung than in spoken stimuli. Bootstrapped estimates were 3.499 [3.460\u20133.537] for spoken stimuli and 3.806 [3.769\u20133.847] for sung stimuli. Furthermore, this mode difference (+0.307 point) was more pronounced for some categories, e.g., mezzos (+0.229, +0.248, +0.115, +0.382, +0.528, +0.333, respectively, in bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, soprano), resulting in an interaction between mode and category [F(4.1,680.1) = 34.3, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.002]. Gender (i.e., CIS vs. TRANS listeners) did not result in a main effect [F(1,164) = 0.7, p = 0.391, \u03b72 < 0.001], and did not interact with voice category [F(1.5,239.1) = 0.4, p = 0.579, \u03b72 < 0.001], with mode [F(1,164) = 2.8, p = 0.097, \u03b72 < 0.001], or in a 3-way [F(4.1,680.1) = 0.5, p = 0.735, \u03b72 < 0.001].\nTo summarize, data from the first phase demonstrated that participants were able to categorize voices successfully, illustrated by the diagonality of ratings in the left panel of Figure\u00a04. Sung stimuli received higher ratings than spoken stimuli (perhaps because they are more expressive and that these qualities tend to be\u00a0more strongly associated with feminine traits; McConnell-Ginet, 1978; Brody, 1993; Briton and Hall, 1995; Vasyura, 2008; Jackson Hearns, 2018). Trans listeners did not differ from cis listeners in their rating of this single modality.\nV-only ratings: As expected, there was a main effect of voice category [F(1.5,250.1) = 1206.0, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.842] reflecting that participants made a guess on the actors\u2019 voice type (despite the videos being silent). Ratings globally fell into traditional male vs. female categories: bootstrapped estimates were 2.442 [2.378\u20132.532] for bass, 2.345 [2.272\u20132.440] for baritone, 2.549 [2.480\u20132.643] for tenor, 4.674 [4.586\u20134.734] for alto, 4.730 [4.654\u20134.791] for mezzo, and 4.842 [4.750\u20134.906] for soprano. Clearly, participants relied heavily on a binary allocation from the actors\u2019 face and body size/shape. Unexpectedly, the main effect of mode was again significant [F(1,164) = 26.1, p < 0.001, \u03b72 < 0.001] reflecting higher ratings in sung than in spoken stimuli. Bootstrapped estimates were 3.568 [3.532\u2013 3.611] for spoken stimuli, and 3.625 [3.593\u20133.670] for sung stimuli. This mode difference (of +0.057 points) was more pronounced for baritones and mezzos than other categories (respectively +0.029, +0.085, \u22120.028, +0.066, +0.123, +0.069 for bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, soprano), resulting in an interaction between mode and category [F(4.4,719.5) = 7.4, p < 0.001, \u03b72 < 0.001]. Gender did not result in a main effect [F(1,164) < 0.1, p = 0.797, \u03b72 < 0.001], and did not interact with voice category [F(1.5,250.1) = 0.1, p = 0.813, \u03b72 < 0.001], with mode [F(1,164) = 1.0, p = 0.309, \u03b72 < 0.001], or in a 3-way [F(4.4,719.5) = 0.4, p = 0.826, \u03b72 < 0.001].\nTo summarize, as illustrated in the middle panel of Figure\u00a04, the silent videos instilled in all participants a binary sense of the actors\u2019 vocal potential (for lack of a better word), with a very slight tendency for some actors to appear higher/brighter when it looked like they were singing as opposed to speaking (perhaps for the same reason as aforementioned, namely that faces often seem more expressive when singing, and emotional expressivity tends to be\u00a0associated with more feminine traits). Trans listeners did not differ from cis listeners in their rating of this single modality."

            "text": "Before analyzing the AV shifts, and specifically whether they followed the direction of the visual biases, it is useful to qualitatively describe the pattern of these visual shifts, i.e., V-A differences. Since V-only ratings were largely flat across the bottom three categories (traditionally male) and the top three categories (traditionally female) with a gap in between, while A-only ratings increased more incrementally with category, this resulted in V shifts exhibiting two downward diagonal patterns across the three bottom and three top categories, respectively (Figure\u00a05, top panels). Also, the effect of mode was substantially stronger in A-only than in V-only stimuli, which translated to the V shifts being overall lower or more negative for sung than for spoken stimuli. These visual shifts were analyzed carefully, but they were consistent with the observations discussed earlier and will not be\u00a0repeated here. The key metric extracted from these V shifts was their direction. When the sign of the V-A difference was positive, it meant the actors\u2019 appearance suggested a brighter or higher voice than the actor actually had. When the sign of the V-A difference was negative, it meant that the actors\u2019 appearance suggested a darker or lower voice than the actor actually had.\nWith this in mind, we\u00a0can now turn to testing the main hypothesis related to AV ratings. First, simple t-tests revealed that the AV shift was significantly above 0\u00a0 in each category and each population (p < 0.001\u00a0 in all 12 cases, including Bonferroni corrections), demonstrating that AV ratings were systematically biased toward the direction of the visual cues. This is one key finding here, as it is one of the first studies to capture the magnitude of this phenomenon with a decent granularity. Furthermore, as illustrated in the bottom panels of Figure\u00a05, there was a main effect of gender [F(1,164) = 7.3, p = 0.007, \u03b72 = 0.018] reflecting that the AV shift was 30% larger for CIS than for TRANS listeners. On average across actor categories, bootstrapped estimates were 0.366 [0.327\u20130.429] for CIS participants and 0.279 [0.246\u20130.331] for TRANS participants. This is a second key finding of the study, supporting our hypothesis. There was also a main effect of category [F(4.4,727.8) = 9.2, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.016] as the AV shift was reduced for basses and sopranos (bootstrapped estimates of, respectively, 0.289 [0.246\u20130.342] and 0.259 [0.222\u20130.305]) relative to actors in the middle of scale (bootstrapped estimates of, respectively, 0.356 [0.323\u20130.397], 0.316 [0.282\u20130.355], 0.336 [0.300\u20130.387], and 0.383 [0.346\u20130.430] for baritones, tenors, altos, and mezzos). Interestingly, the interaction between voice category and gender approached significance [F(4.4,727.8) = 2.2, p = 0.056, \u03b72 = 0.004] and would have suggested that the resistance of TRANS listeners occurred more toward actors on the extremities of the human range such as basses and sopranos than toward categories in the middle. Finally, there was no main effect of mode [F(1,164) = 1.2, p = 0.271, \u03b72 < 0.001], or mode by category interaction [F(4.6,754.3) = 1.5, p = 0.178, \u03b72 = 0.002], or mode by gender interaction [F(1,164) = 0.2, p = 0.666, \u03b72 < 0.001] or a 3-way interaction [F(4.6,754.3) = 0.7, p = 0.583, \u03b72 < 0.001]. In other words, the bias observed was identical whether actors spoke or sung, and this was true regardless of the actor or the listener. This is not necessarily intuitive, considering that mode has a systematic effect in single modalities (sung stimuli being rated as higher/brighter) but since it applies to A, V, and AV, it has negligible impact on this metric. Note that the same is true of the impact of emotional content (see Supplementary material 1).\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org"

Linear regressions were conducted between the AV shift (still signed, so that positive values varied with the V shift direction) of each participant with their averaged score on gender views, and this was done for each category separately. Figure\u00a06 illustrates that none of the regressions were significant (p > 0.198, and neither were there significant correlations within trans participants only, or within cis participants only). This lack of correlation implies that gender views (which are largely opinions of gender roles in society) are presumably not the underlying mechanism that gives trans participants an advantage in resisting visual biases in this task. We\u00a0surmise that it is specifically the life experiences of trans individuals and the mental dissociation between physical appearance and voice quality appraisal that are at the root of this benefit."

            "text": "In the analyses described above, the AV shift was always expressed as a positive value when it followed the direction of the visual bias. AV ratings (shown in Figure\u00a0 4, right panel) did not appear massively different from A ratings, despite being systematically 0.2\u20130.4 point shifted in the V direction, because these upward and downward effects counteracted each other. Remember, however, that three actors were chosen in each category to be\u00a0upwards misfits (referred to as up-actors), downwards misfits (referred to as down-actors), or relatively good fits (referred to as stay-actors) based on heuristics commonly used in casting trends. Although we\u00a0would generally object to such heuristics, we\u00a0thought it was an interesting exercise to contrast upward vs. downward biases. An analysis was conducted as in section 4.3 but adding appearance direction as an additional factor. This new analysis revealed a main effect of appearance direction [F(2,328) = 11.8, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.005], reflecting that the magnitude of the AV shift was greatest with up-actors (0.36), intermediate with stay-actors (0.32) and weakest with down-actors (0.29), with each pairwise comparison significant [p < 0.023]. This is best illustrated in the bottom-right panel of Figure\u00a07 (similarly whether actors spoke or sung). However, appearance direction interacted with category [F(9.1,1486.3) = 5.7, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.012]: as illustrated in the bottom-left panel of Figure\u00a0 7, it had little/no role for basses (p = 0.328), baritones (p = 0.142), altos (p = 0.089), and mezzos (p = 0.313); but some role with tenors (p = 0.017) and sopranos (p < 0.001), where a greater AV shift occurred toward up-actors than down-actors. Importantly though, appearance direction did not interact with gender [F(2,328) = 0.6, p = 0.541, \u03b72 < 0.001] or in a 3-way interaction [F(9.1,1486.3) = 1.0, p = 0.424, \u03b72 = 0.002]. A rather unexpected trend is notable among basses where TRANS participants experienced the effect of appearance direction in the opposite direction to its main effect (i.e., greater AV shift with downactors than with up-actors) which suggests that the resistance of TRANS participants in basses is particularly induced by actors whose appearance reflects a higher voice type than they actually had. But the lack of 3-way interaction should prevent us from commenting\nFIGURE\u00a05 Visual shifts (top panels) calculated from the difference V \u2013 A ratings in each category of actors, each mode, and each group of listeners. AV shifts (bottom panels) calculated from the difference AV \u2013 A ratings multiplied by the sign of V shift so that positive value always indicate a shift toward the visual influence.\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\non this any further: as a first approximation, the two groups did not differ in their dependency to appearance direction, regardless of actor category. In a different analysis, we\u00a0also replaced voice category by mode, but appearance direction did not interact with mode [F(2,328) = 0.5, p = 0.635, \u03b72 < 0.001] or in a 3-way interaction (with mode and gender) [F(2,328) = 0.1, p = 0.877, \u03b72 < 0.001].\nFIGURE\u00a06 Lack of correlation between individuals\u2019 average score on gender views (abscissa) and their average AV shift (signed, so that positive values indicate a shift in the direction of the visual bias).

As we\u00a0 had intended, the visual biases tended to be\u00a0 positive for up-actors, mixed for stay-actors, and negative for down-actors (top-right, Figure\u00a07). But it is interesting to observe that the AV shifts were largest with up-actors and lowest with down-actors, inferring some degree of directionality to the phenomenon discussed in this study: somehow the actors who suffer from the most inaccurate judgment of their voice are those who look more feminine than their voice reveals; actors who look more masculine than their voice reveals are relatively more spared. This directionality effect appears applicable to trans participants as much as to cis participants, and regardless of whether actors spoke or sang."

            "text": "Overall, the current study shows that a person\u2019s impression of vocal type is pulled toward a gender binary when visual cues are present, while their reliance on auditory cues would allow for a more nuanced, graded view. Importantly, this influence of the visual binary affects cisgender observers more than transgender observers. Such misclassifications of voice type can negatively impact singers\u2019 health.\nWith only a short tutorial on what basses, baritones, tenors, altos, mezzos, and sopranos sounded like, listeners were capable of roughly placing the voice of different actors (here 18) at different points on a continuous scale from low/dark to high/bright. With visual-only stimuli, however, participants largely fall back on a dichotomous allocation. There is a lot of information within these silent videos (body type, facial expression, breathing dynamics, articulatory motion), but our findings imply that people make little use of these potentially subtle visual cues when rating Fach. In other words, visual perception of speakers and singers remains binarily divided along traditional gender lines of man/woman, compared to its auditory counterpart. With AV stimuli, participants could have relied almost exclusively on powerful auditory cues, which led to more gradual categorization, rather than on visual cues which led to poor discrimination. Yet this is not what they did; all participants were pulled toward a gender binary to some degree by visual information.\nThe size of the effect found here was on average 0.2 to 0.4 points on a 6-point scale across all actors. This phenomenon is a perfect example of visual dominance (Colavita, 1974) despite its apparent ineffectiveness in categorizing voices, but this dominance might not be\u00a0set in stone, as trans listeners were here able to resist it, at least to some degree. This is perhaps the most exciting finding of this enterprise, suggesting that trans individuals are better candidates than most, for objectively evaluating the true size, timbre, range/tessitura of voice Fach as well as the gender cues present in natural speech. In fact, we\u00a0found this trans advantage to be\u00a0slightly amplified for actors on the extremities of the scale (i.e., basses and sopranos). Unfortunately, despite this trans advantage for judging voices of all types, it is cis listeners who are usually called upon to judge trans voices, in both musical and non-musical/speech related contexts. Here, we\u00a0will first review the relevant literature on AV integration and discuss the extent to which one could act against it to limit the current biases in voice appraisal. Second, we\u00a0will discuss the literature more applicable to the trans community."

            "text": "AV integration appears to be\u00a0obligatory to a certain extent and useful in most contexts, as it can help us decipher the world around us (e.g., lip reading, identifying a speaker\u2019s mood, to support communication). However, this means that in the presence of conflicting visual information, our judgments of sound can be\u00a0distorted, as demonstrated by the McGurk effect (McGurk and MacDonald, 1976). A few studies have tried to determine what causes differences in individual susceptibility to McGurk effects and what factors can affect AV fusion.\nProverbio et\u00a0 al. (2016) wanted to find out whether musical training would allow people to resist the McGurk effect, using a similar design (A, V, and AV). Like trans listeners in our study, musicians were able to ignore visual cues and focus on sound, resulting in AV ratings that were closer to A ratings. This suggests that training in auditory skills can help people evaluate sound more objectively. Thus, it would be\u00a0interesting to determine whether our main finding (trans resistance to AV integration) would be\u00a0reduced among musicians and amplified among non-musicians. Our study did not track musicianship but, given the relatively large samples used here, it is rather unlikely that the effect would be\u00a0 entirely due to TRANS participants being somehow more musically trained than the CIS participants recruited here.\nChl\u00e1dkov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. (2021) tested the way young and older adults responded to the McGurk effect at the very beginning of the maskwearing mandates in Czechia and a month later to see whether speech perception relied less on visual cues after being deprived of lip/ articulatory motion. Participants were presented with congruent AV stimuli (which served to exclude unreliable participants) and McGurk stimuli. The same experiment was repeated a month later but, unfortunately, not all participants in the second experiment were the same as in the first. A longitudinal design was chosen for 41 (young) students while a cross-sectional design was chosen for adults covering a larger age range. Bearing these methodological differences in mind, results showed that young people reduced their reliance on visual cues, whereas older people increased their reliance after a month of using face masks. Women exhibited a larger McGurk effect than men in both sessions (before and after a month of mask wearing), and they also relied less on auditory cues after a month of mask wearing while men relied more on them. This puzzling result shows that the relationship between different modalities is more complicated than what could be\u00a0 speculated based on the quality and availability of environmental cues. There are additional socio-psychological factors at play and the current study certainly adds support to the idea that the weighing of audiovisual cues is malleable.\nBrown et\u00a0 al. (2018) attempted to uncover the cognitive and perceptual reasons why the McGurk effect might or might not occur. They investigated the effects of lipreading ability, response to ambiguous sounds (continuum between [s] and [\u0283]), level of cognitive ability (processing speed and working memory), and attention. They found that only lipreading skill predicted susceptibility to the McGurk effect. This sort of enterprise is incredibly useful to our present goal. If we\u00a0 are to develop behavioral training methods to counteract harmful voice appraisals, we\u00a0need to focus on the few skills that can be\u00a0sharpened (quickly) to resist AV integration. Brown et\u00a0al. suggest that we\u00a0 turn our attention to the quality of visual cues and the\nFrontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org\nefficiency with which they are extracted. However, this is rather at odds with the previous studies: Proverbio et\u00a0 al. (2016) suggested sharper auditory skills would be\u00a0 beneficial, and Chl\u00e1dkov\u00e1 et\u00a0 al. (2021) pointed toward higher-level cognitive processes including learning. This leads us to speculate that the strength of AV integration might depend more on the goal of the task and peculiarities of the experimental design, rather than being a stable trait that can only be\u00a0 changed slowly and through much exposure. This calls for replications of Brown et\u00a0al.\u2019s study in the context of speaker\u2019s and singer\u2019s voice appraisal.\nIn the same vein, Nahorna et\u00a0al. (2012) sought ways to stop or limit fusion of AV materials by \u201cpriming\u201d participants to process AV stimuli in a coherent (multimodal) manner or with dissociated modalities. They preceded a test McGurk stimulus by either a congruent or an incongruent AV sample. They found that an incoherent sample (consisting of 5 syllables dubbed over the speaker saying a sentence) could greatly reduce the McGurk effect. This is a remarkable proof-of-concept that it is possible to prevent AV fusion simply by facilitating or hindering participants\u2019 multisensory processing briefly before a test (another indication of the task dependency of this resistance). But this demonstration lacks a good deal of ecological validity. When a speaker or singer auditions for a role, there is little one could do in practice to force the judges\u2019 brain to question the synchronization or congruency of A and V materials. So, unfortunately, we\u00a0would need to find interventions that lead to more permanent changes in modality weighting or in voice-body expectations, not just a priming effect that carries over for a few seconds.\nFinally, in terms of brain activity, we\u00a0know that visual input is integrated into auditory processing in the periphery of the auditory cortex (Atilgan et\u00a0al., 2018). Using fMRI, Nath and Beauchamp (2012) found a stronger response in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) on the left side when a person is more likely to perceive a McGurk effect. In the light of the present findings, the group difference in susceptibility to body/face biases is presumably substantiated by neurological markers, and therefore we\u00a0 would imagine trans participants to exhibit a weaker response in the STS than cis participants in an experimental design similar to ours. However, the lateralization of STS activity suggests that AV integration may differ considerably in the context of language versus musical or social contexts, whereas behaviorally this does not seem to matter (i.e., mode had negligible role on the AV shifts)."

            "text": "Most previous studies on transgender people and voice have focused on voice dissatisfaction in the trans community (McNeill et\u00a0al., 2008; Hays, 2013; Valente and de Medeiros, 2020; Menezes et\u00a0al., 2022), acoustic parameters thought to be\u00a0 associated with gender perception from the cisgender listener\u2019s perspective (Coleman, 1983; Gelfer and Schofield, 2000; Gelfer and Bennett, 2013; Dahl and Mahler, 2020), and trans linguistics (Gratton, 2016; Zimman, 2020). The present study turned the tables and showed that, when involved in the tasks as voice judges (rather than when their involvement is limited to voicing stimuli), trans individuals can leverage their life experience with voice and identity. There is, to our knowledge, no study\nthat ever demonstrated a trans listener\u2019s advantage in voice evaluation. These findings teach us that it is possible to learn, perhaps through extensive training and exposure, to resist preconceived and culturally ingrained voice-body expectations when evaluating voices.\nMeanwhile, a few studies exist, with trans individuals as actors, which aimed to assess how trans voice may be\u00a0unfairly perceived. This is problematic as it excludes transgender people from their own care and assumes that achieving a \u201ccis-passing\u201d voice is always the ultimate goal of trans speakers and singers. Furthermore, it perpetuates traditional binary ideals of femininity and masculinity, which is damaging to all voice users (not just trans ones), when gender theory in general has moved away from the binary and increasingly toward the spectrum (Butler, 1990; Halberstam, 1998/2018; Williams, 2015; Morgenroth and Ryan, 2018). This spectrum should then be\u00a0 present in both vocal production and perception, as in other areas of gender expression.\nPerhaps closest to the current paradigm, Van Borsel et\u00a0al. (2001) examined the interaction of physical appearance and voice in gender perception of trans women. They divided listeners into two balanced groups: one that would first evaluate V-only stimuli and then AV stimuli and the other group who would evaluate A-only stimuli followed by AV stimuli. This separation of participants into two groups was far from ideal but was done because of concerns that participants would recognize the actors in the different modes (exacerbated by the fact that few actors/stimuli were used). Responses were provided to assess gender instead of voice type, but at least they varied on a continuous scale. For 9 out of 14 trans women, participants provided higher ratings (more feminine) in V-only, intermediate in AV, with lowest ratings for A-only. This is the pattern the authors expected, on the basis that trans women voices would convey too many masculine features. But this did not happen in the five other speakers, for which participants actually provided higher ratings in A-only than in AV and V-only (suggesting that participants were then perhaps judging the visual stimuli unfairly). Contrary to the authors\u2019 beliefs, we\u00a0think the key point is that while there is systemic prejudice against trans people in society, prejudicial judgments are not necessarily made systematically. We\u00a0 must not generalize about individual trans people or about their vocal treatment plans; but rather we\u00a0should consider the specific needs and challenges of each person. What Van Borsel et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2001) findings do prove to be\u00a0systematic is the response to AV stimuli, which is always in between that of A-only and V-only stimuli. In other words, this is yet another demonstration that AV integration is hard to resist, and this may perhaps be\u00a0particularly true when assessing trans women\u2019s voices.\nIn a similar study of trans men\u2019s voices, Van Borsel et\u00a0al. (2009) found little bias (in either direction, although this is difficult to assess given that participants were again split in two groups evaluating A to AV in one group, and V to AV in the other), with perhaps a small dependency on the speaker\u2019s habitual voice pitch. Comparing their findings across the two studies, the authors argued that high voices in men are more accepted than low voices in women. To our knowledge, no study has ever demonstrated this to be\u00a0true, but it has been written about since then (Block et\u00a0al., 2018) and it is anecdotally accepted within the trans community that trans men attract less attention in general than trans women (Atkinson, 2018; Kiss, 2018; Alter, 2022). These anecdotal observations point to a major area of concern in women and gender studies, and we\u00a0did find evidence in our study that those whose appearances were more masculine than their voices suggested suffered less (see 4.5). From this, we\u00a0can infer that trans\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org\nwomen with voices perceived as more masculine that their appearance suggests generally experience more bias from society than trans men whose voices may be\u00a0 higher or brighter than their appearance suggests. More generally, people with a feminine appearance (whether cis or trans) may be\u00a0 more closely scrutinized than those with a masculine appearance.\nOf note, the two Van Borsel et\u00a0 al. are problematic due to (1) outdated language and ideas about sex and gender and (2) the challenges associated with properly examining a pattern that is inherently bimodal. However, one finding that drew our attention is the fact that the listeners\u2019 group (whether they were lay people or speech-language pathologists, SLPs) had no role. Assuming that the SLPs had some level of professional or at least academic expertise in voice relative to lay people, this finding might seem in contradiction with the present ones. Nonetheless, it reinforces the notion that the trans listener advantage observed here comes from a first-hand experience with body-voice dissociation, and not just from greater knowledge of the voice apparatus. The current study uses a somewhat similar method of evaluating speakers with the advantage of capturing within-subject judgments in A-only, V-only, and AV stimuli, with a much larger sample size of listeners, a greater diversity of actors, still placing gender implicitly on a continuum. On this basis, we\u00a0 believe that the impact of physical appearance in voice evaluation is strongly dependent on the listener\u2019s characteristics (contrary to their conclusion), but perhaps not necessarily their knowledge of voice/speech disorders.\nAV integration set aside, there are a few studies that failed to show a trans listener advantage. For example, interested in how a trans voice might be\u00a0perceived over the course of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), Brown et\u00a0al. (2020) showed that cis listeners just like trans listeners categorized a trans masculine speaker as \u201cdefinitely female\u201d until week 14 of HRT and shifted their response to \u201cdefinitely male\u201d at week 28. Other than demonstrating that HRT is a successful approach to changing voice characteristics in trans masculine speakers, their lack of group difference suggested that trans listeners follow the same gender \u201crules\u201d as cis listeners when judging A-only stimuli. This is not inconsistent with the present data as gender had negligible effect in A-only conditions (TRANS listeners tended to use a larger scale overall, not a different boundary between the three traditionally male and the three traditionally female categories). The novelty that our study provides is that trans listeners would be\u00a0better at relying on these auditory cues alone and ignoring visual cues which hinder a more subtle categorization. In other words, we\u00a0would suspect that the lack of group difference observed in Brown et\u00a0 al. (2020) would not necessarily hold with AV materials and more ecological settings.\nHope and Lilley (2022) borrowed the framework of language acquisition to theorize that gender perception (e.g., just like vowel perception) would differ depending on whether actors fell in \u201cnative\u201d compared to \u201cnon-native\u201d regions of their (abstract) gender space. With the help of artificial intelligence, they generated synthetic nonbinary voices with a neutral F0 but within traditional regions for contour and vowel formants (masculine, feminine) or more untapped regions of contour and vowel formants (neutral, mixed). Cis and gender-expansive listeners evaluated voices both along a continuum from male to female and categorically by checking one of five boxes: man, woman, nonbinary, agender, and genderfluid. Results showed that cisgender people tended to rate voices on the extremes of the continuum, while the gender expansive listeners placed voices more in the center of the spectrum. The more extreme ratings by cis listeners\ncould be\u00a0a consequence of greater dichotomy compared to gender expansive listeners who were happy placing speakers in the middle. This pattern seems largely consistent with our message that trans listeners are better (more nuanced) judges of voices, possibly even in the absence of visual cues.\nOther researchers have looked at the role of sexual orientation, not gender identity, on voice perception of cis and trans speakers with A-only stimuli (Hancock and Pool, 2017). In a first task, listeners rated speakers\u2019 gender along a continuum just like the current study, and there was no significant interaction between the listeners\u2019 sexual orientation and the speakers\u2019 gender. Despite the authors\u2019 claim (from non-significant results), this suggests that the listener\u2019s sexual orientation is rather irrelevant to perception of cis or trans speakers. In a second task, listeners were asked to follow up with their continuous rating and make a dichotomous categorization between male and female. Once again, there was no interaction between the listener\u2019s sexual orientation and the speakers\u2019 gender. Also, note that in both tasks, it made no difference whether the listeners were of male or female sex, and no difference whether they had any contact with the LGBTQ community. Hancock & Pool\u2019s findings indicate that sexual orientation is likely to play a negligible role in the evaluation of A-only stimuli, but it is not clear whether these results would hold with AV materials. We\u00a0 believe that trans people, of any sexual orientation, would have more cause to focus on gender-loaded cues in voices than straight or non-straight cisgender people.\nFinally, Owen and Hancock (2010) compared trans women\u2019s selfperception of voice with cis listener perceptions and found that both groups were in agreement. They concluded that trans women\u2019s selfratings were therefore useful for monitoring and evaluating their own progress in voice therapy. This study, although perhaps wellintentioned, placed cis listeners opinions as the ground truth with the obtention of \u201ccis-passing\u201d voices as the goal. Inadvertently this invalidates the independent opinions of transgender people and again reduces agency in their own care. Moreover, it is a misconception that transgender people, in transitioning, are always aiming for a cis-passing appearance or voice. Besides being a sweeping generalization about a diverse umbrella group, this assumption erases trans culture in which ideas about femininity, masculinity, and other genders exist, but are not necessarily the same as in cis culture. While the goal of a trans person may indeed be\u00a0to pass as their gender, this does not require passing as cis. If the trans advantage observed in our study is replicated in other studies and confirmed by several lines of investigation, we\u00a0may eventually consider trans judges\u2019 opinions of voice to be\u00a0the gold standard in the future."

            "text": "Finally, it should be\u00a0noted that several parameters have been found to influence gender perception in voice. Pitch (F0), resonances of the vocal tract (shape of spectral envelope and vowel formant placement) and articulation (how we\u00a0 pronounce words using the lips, teeth, tongue, palate, glottis, nasal cavity, pharynx) all affect vocal timbre and are perhaps the most salient properties related to gender perception. Other factors play a role as well: melodic contour, word stress and word choice, and non-verbal cues such as posture and eye contact (Jackson Hearns, 2018). Many of these influences strongly apply to speech but\nFrontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org\nbreak down in singing because the vocalist has limited interpretive freedom in musical contexts. In this study, we\u00a0found singing to induce a more feminine percept and this could be\u00a0utilized by trans individuals in either direction (exaggerating contours and emotional expressivity in speech to sound more feminine or singing in a flatter manner more speech-like to sound more masculine). These techniques could be\u00a0used by trans individuals as speakers to influence how they are perceived in the world, but they will not address the problem at hand, which concerns listener prejudice."

            "text": "Although it may seem like the sound of a voice should be\u00a0 the primary factor, perhaps the only factor, considered when listeners perceive and classify a voice, in reality due to AV integration, a speaker\u2019s or singer\u2019s appearance affects how listeners categorize and evaluate that voice. This has led to the exclusion of transgender singers (and, to some extent, cisgender singers) who do not meet voice-body expectations from formal singing experiences, such as participation in community or professional choirs. It also affects the classification of professional opera singers, which can be\u00a0 detrimental to their long-term vocal health. This study found that transgender listeners, on average, were better suited than cisgender listeners to objectively identify a singer\u2019s or speaker\u2019s voice type, perhaps because they were better able to ignore the actors\u2019 appearance, a finding that opens exciting avenues to combat implicit (or sometimes explicit) biases in voice evaluation.\nThis work also has implications for the field of trans voice, showing that cisgender listeners are more pulled toward a binary gender perception when visual information is available, which could either help or hinder a trans person depending on their visible gender expression. Perceived voice-body mismatches not only affect singers but, worse yet, can lead to obstacles in the daily lives of transgender people who must use their voices (and thus risk outing themselves) to secure medical services, take public transportation, order food, etc. It is therefore crucial that we\u00a0study the conditions under which visual biases in voice evaluation occur so that we\u00a0might begin to break down both the explicit and implicit biases that exist in gender perception of the voice."
