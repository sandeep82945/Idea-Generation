 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop new metrics to better quantify the different types of distribution shifts between source and target groups. The current metrics of label distribution shift and input similarity are useful but still imperfect in explaining the varied generalization performance. New metrics could provide deeper insights. 

2. Explore semi-supervised or unsupervised methods to obtain labels for the target group instead of relying solely on the labeling ability of LLMs. This could improve labeling accuracy and lead to more robust prompts.

3. Study how to optimize prompts that can generalize to completely unseen target groups, without access to any unlabeled target data. This is a more challenging but practical scenario.

4. Evaluate the impact of other LLM inputs like in-context examples on generalization. Jointly optimizing prompts and examples could improve robustness. 

5. Extend the framework to smaller LLMs without instruction understanding abilities by adapting it for gradient-based prompt optimization. This could broaden the applicability of the robust optimization approach.
