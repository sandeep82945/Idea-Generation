 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on few-shot entity linking:

1. Explore other pre-trained language models besides ELECTRA as the backbone for the keyword extractor. Models like BERT, RoBERTa or T5 may further improve performance. 

2. Investigate different distant supervision approaches to generate training data for the keyword extractor. For example, using entity descriptions from multiple knowledge bases could provide more diverse and noisy training data.

3. Apply the keyword extraction idea to improve candidate generation in low-resource languages or domains. The technique could help mitigate vocabulary mismatch issues.

4. Study how to effectively combine the strengths of dense and sparse retrievers in few-shot scenarios. Hybrid methods could outperform either approach individually.

5. Evaluate the keyword extraction approach on other few-shot information extraction tasks like relation extraction or event extraction. The technique may generalize to other data scarcity problems.
