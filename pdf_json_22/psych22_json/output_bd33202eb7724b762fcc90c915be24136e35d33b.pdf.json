    "abstractText": "3 Background: Obstetric violence is a problem that has grown worldwide, and a particularly 4 worrying one in Spain. Such violence has repercussions for women, and for the professionals 5 who cause them. Preventing this problem seems fundamental. 6 Objective: This study evaluated how health sciences students perceived obstetric violence. 7 Design: A cross-sectional study conducted between October 2019 and November 2020 8 Participants: A sample of Spanish health sciences students studying degrees of nursing, 9 medicine, midwifery, and psychology. 10 Methods: A validated questionnaire was used: Perception of Obstetric Violence in Students 11 (PercOV-S). Socio-demographic and control variables were included. A descriptive and 12 comparative multivariate analysis was performed with the obtained data. 13 Results: 540 questionnaires were completed with an overall mean score of 3.83 points 14 (SD\u00b10.63), with 2.83 points (SD\u00b10.91) on the protocolised-visible dimension and 4.15 points 15 (SD\u00b10.67) on the non-protocolised-invisible obstetric violence dimension. Statistically 16 significant differences were obtained for degree studied (p<0.001), gender (p<0.001), 17 experience (p<0.001), ethnic group (p<0.001), the obstetric violence concept (p<0.001) and 18 academic year (p<0.005). There were three significant multivariate models for the 19 questionnaire\u2019s overall score and dimensions. 20",

            "text": "In 1985, the Declaration of Fortaleza indicated the need to make specific policies about using 29 technology during childbirth (World Health Organization, 1985). A consensus has been 30 reached about these recommendations by multidisciplinary work teams, which are 31 considered applicable to all perinatal services worldwide (World Health Organization, 1985). 32 Nevertheless, it appears that that the recommendations are not well-established. The World 33 Health Organization (WHO) refers to the need to respect human rights during childbirth with 34 women entitled to the highest level of care, dignified and respectful attention, and the right 35 to not suffer violence or discrimination (World Health Organization, 2014). The latest WHO 36 publications describe positive birth experiences by specifying that women wish physiological 37 labour and childbirth, feel they are in control, and personal accomplishment from 38 participating in decision making, even if desired and necessary medical interventions are 39 required (World Health Organization, 2018). 40\nDespite national and international recommendations and research outcomes targeted to 41 more respectful sexual and reproductive healthcare for women (Ministerio de Sanidad, 2010; 42 Ministerio de Sanidad Servicios Sociales e Igualdad, 2012; World Health Organization, 2018), 43 an interventionist model that centres on medicalised childbirth predominates in Spain (Mena-44 Tudela et al., 2021). This model is characterised by medical intervention, with limited 45 involvement of women in decision making while giving birth (Hodnett et al., 2012). The WHO 46 states that research into women\u2019s pregnancy and birth experiences indicates a disturbing 47\n4\npicture because women worldwide suffer disrespectful, offensive or careless treatment 48 during childbirth (World Health Organization, 2014). 49\nWorldwide, women-centred approaches, multidisciplinary teams, continuous healthcare, and 50 specialisation show high levels of women\u2019s satisfaction and better results in maternity 51 services (Downe et al., 2018; Macpherson et al., 2016; Perriman and Davis, 2016). While this 52 progress was being made, the concept of obstetric violence gained ground. While reaching a 53 consensus about a clear definition of obstetric violence is urged (Brice\u00f1o Morales et al., 2018; 54 \u0160imonovi\u0107, 2019), according to the United Nations (\u0160imonovi\u0107, 2019), obstetric violence 55 occurs in a broad context, one of structural inequality, discrimination and patriarchy, which 56 results from lack of education and training and respect for women\u2019s equality and their human 57 rights. Other authors have indicated social stratification (Castro, R; Fr\u00edas, 2019), a low socio-58 economic level (Santiago et al., 2018), youth, race or women not knowing their rights as 59 possible causes (Grilo Diniz et al., 2018). 60\nThe reported obstetric violence rates worldwide are worrying, and perceived obstetric 61 violence figures vary: 21.2% in Italy (Ravaldi et al., 2018) and 28.8% in India (Bhattacharya and 62 Sundari Ravindran, 2018), 75.1% in Ethiopia (Muhabaw Shumye Mihret, 2019), with 38.3% in 63 Spain (Mena-Tudela et al., 2020c). It is necessary to stress that the interventions made while 64 giving birth can have physical, mental and emotional consequences for women 65 (Chattopadhyay et al., 2018; Guill\u00e9n, 2015; P\u00e9rez D\u2019gregorio, 2010). Consequences include 66 Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which affects roughly 5% of new mothers (Bradley, 67 2017). The risk of postpartum PTSD in Spanish women increases to 13.1%, and is found to be 68 related to obstetric violence (Mart\u00ednez-Vazquez et al., 2021). There are reports of women 69 having difficulties returning to sexual relationships, rage about and mistrusting relationships 70\n5\nwith healthcare professionals, and secondary infertility from fear of suffering obstetric 71 violence (Ministerio de Sanidad, 2010) again. Women may also suffer physical sequela like 72 loss of a uterus after performing an unnecessary caesarean section or dyspareunia after being 73 subjected to episiotomy for no justified reason (Guill\u00e9n, 2015). These repercussions are 74 documented among women and affect the healthcare personnel who witness such violence. 75 Professionals also suffer symptoms compatible with PTSD (Sadler et al., 2016) as they witness 76 obstetric violence and some even leave their profession because such practices go against 77 their own ethics and dignity (Olza-Fern\u00e1ndez and Ruiz-Berd\u00fan, 2015). 78\nFor these reasons, preventing obstetric violence should be a priority. Prevention can entail 79 training for and raising the awareness of health sciences students about the rights of all 80 women of fertile age to receive respectful evidence-based healthcare and not being careless 81 with their opinions and preferences (Mena-Tudela et al., 2020b; \u0160imonovi\u0107, 2019). A previous 82 study on changing perceptions of obstetric violence among students showed that an 83 educational intervention can change students' perceptions. In addition, normalisation of 84 obstetric violence was shown to occur with progression of training and personal obstetric 85 experience (Mena-Tudela et al., 2020b). Understanding health science students' perception 86 of obstetric violence can help to design specific programmes. This study aimed to evaluate 87 how health sciences (medicine, psychology, nursing) students of the Universitat Jaume I (UJI; 88 Spain), and midwifery students from the Valencian School of Health Studies (EVES; Spain), 89 perceived obstetric violence. 90"

            "text": "A cross-sectional study was performed with health sciences (UJI and EVES) students between 92 October 2019 and November 2020. 93\n6\nIn Spain, nursing and psychology degrees last four academic years, whereas medical degrees 94 takes six academic years, and all are studied at university. To access university, students need 95 to have acquired general knowledge and passed a specific entry test. The students with higher 96 marks can select the studies they wish. Obstetric-gynaecology nursing studies (midwifery) are 97 taught in specialised teaching centres that are answerable to healthcare services. Access to 98 the midwifery specialty involves learning, passing the nursing degree, and then passing an 99\nexam to apply for the obstetric-gynaecology specialty call. 100\n2.1 Variables and instruments 101\nThe socio-demographic variables were: age, gender, degree studied (medicine, psychology, 102 nursing, midwifery), academic year, healthcare experience in maternity services (yes, no), 103 years experience (< 1 year, 1-4 years, > 4 years), present at women\u2019s birth (yes, no), time since 104 attendance at women\u2019s birth (< 1 year, 1-4 years, > 4 years), personal experience with 105 pregnancies/births (yes, no), time since pregnancies and births (< 1 year, 1-4 years, > 4 years). 106\nVariables related to how students perceived women\u2019s different treatments during pregnancy 107 and childbirth were also included according to their ethnic group, socio-economic status or 108 being an immigrant, along with already knowing the concept of obstetric violence (yes, no). 109 Students\u2019 obstetric violence perception was measured by the PercOV-S (Perception of 110 Obstetric Violence in Students) questionnaire (Mena-Tudela et al., 2020a). 111\n2.1.1 The PercOV-S questionnaire 112\nThe PercOV-S questionnaire comprises 33 items that measure students\u2019 obstetric violence 113 perception on a 5-level Likert scale from 1 (no obstetric violence) to 5 (a lot of obstetric 114\n7\nviolence). The maximum score per item and dimension, and the overall score, are 5 points. 115 Higher scores indicate that obstetric violence is more perceived. 116\nDuring its validation, the PercOV-S obtained a factor analysis that reduced the questionnaire 117 to two dimensions: protocolised-visible obstetric violence, namely those obstetric 118 interventions that tend to be protocolised (like peripheral access, shaving pubis or lithotomy 119 position); non-protocolised-invisible obstetric violence, namely those obstetric interventions 120 that do not tend to be protocolised like Kristeller manoeuvre, using offensive language or 121 lacking respect, which explained 54.47% of variability. Both the overall score and dimensions 122 gave excellent internal consistency (Global: \u03b1=0.936; protocolised-visible obstetric violence: 123 \u03b1=0.802; non-protocolised-invisible obstetric violence: \u03b1=0.952) (Mena-Tudela et al., 2020a). 124 Excellent internal consistency was also obtained in this study - Global: \u03b1=0.923; protocolised-125 visible obstetric violence: \u03b1=0.832; non-protocolised-invisible obstetric violence: \u03b1=0.923. 126\n2.2 Participants and data collection 127\nStudents were invited to participate in this study via email. All proposed variables, and the 128 PercOV-S questionnaire, were structured in Google Forms. All health sciences students 129 (medicine, psychology, nursing, midwifery) were included in the study. The questionnaires 130 with more than 10% of contents left unanswered were excluded. Sample size calculation was 131 completed with the GRANMO programme, which indicated that a sample with 429 individuals 132 sufficed to estimate (95% confidence) a 50% population percentage with a precision of 4 133 percentage units. A 10% loss percentage was considered. 134\nThe study was designed in accordance with Organic Law 03/2018, of 5 December, on Personal 135 Data Protection and Guaranteeing Digital Rights. The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 136 (charity, no maleficence, autonomy, justice) were respected. The study was approved by the 137\n8\nUJI Deontological Committee (CD/26/2020) and the EVES Obstetric-Gynecology Nursing Unit 138 Area Management. 139\n2.3 Analysis 140\nA descriptive analysis was conducted by calculating means, standard deviations and 95% 141 confidence intervals for the quantitative variables. For the qualitative variables, the 142 distribution of frequencies and percentages were considered. For the bivariate analysis, 143 Mann-Whitney U and Kruskall-Wallis tests were employed to detect relationships between 144 the variables and those related to the PercOV-S questionnaire (global, per dimension and 145 items). 146\nThree multiple linear regressions were performed by taking the PercOV-S questionnaire score 147 and its dimensions as dependent variables. The introduced independent variables were those 148 showing significant differences in the bivariate analysis in relation to the overall PercOV-S 149 questionnaire score and its dimensions. As they were categorical variables, the necessary 150 dummy variables were created to perform the multiple linear regression analysis. The Intro 151 method was used. The F level was set between 0.05 and 0.1. The non-existence of collinearity 152 problems was confirmed by the variance inflation factor (VIF<10). The analysis was performed 153 with version 21 of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The statistical level of 154 significance was set at p\u22640.05 to compare hypotheses. 155\n3. Results 156\n3.1 The sample\u2019s socio-demographic profile 157\n540 questionnaires were collected. Students\u2019 mean age was 22.37 years (SD=5.413, Range: 158 18-54 years). Of the whole sample, 82.4% (n=445) were female; 39.3% (n=212) came from 159\n9\nnursing, 27.6% (n=149) psychology, 21.1% (n=114) midwifery and 12.0% (n=65) medical 160 degrees. 161\nOf all students, 24.8% (n=134) had been on clinical placements or worked in some maternity 162 service; 19.3% (n=104) had been present at a woman\u2019s birth, of whom 39.8% (n=66) had seen 163 women being treated differently according to their ethnic group, 31.3% (n=51) their socio-164 economic status; 34.6% (n=56) perceived women being treated worse during childbirth for 165 being an immigrant; 4.3% (n=23) of the sample had been pregnant and 3.5% (n=19) had given 166 birth themselves. Finally, 56.5% (n=277) already knew the obstetric violence concept. Table 167 1 shows the sample\u2019s socio-demographic and control variables distributed into degrees 168 studied. 169\n3.2 Perception of Obstetric Violence (PercOV-S). 170\nThe overall mean PercOV-S questionnaire score was 3.83 points (SD\u00b10.63; 95%CI=3.77-3.89), 171 which indicates moderate obstetric violence perception. The protocolised-visible obstetric 172 violence dimension (including peripheral access, shaving pubis or lithotomy position) 173 obtained a mean score of 2.83 points (SD\u00b10.91; 95%CI=2.76-2.91), which denotes poorly 174 perceived obstetric violence. The mean for the non-protocolised-invisible obstetric violence 175 dimension (including Kristeller manoeuvre, using offensive language or lacking respect) was 176 4.15 points (SD\u00b10.67; 95% CI=4.09-4.21), which suggests considerable obstetric violence 177 perception. 178\nThe results indicated statistically significant differences in the overall questionnaire score, its 179 dimensions, and most items according to degree studied (Table 2). Table 3 offers the 180 descriptive and comparative results for both the dimensions and overall PercOV-S score per 181\n10\nacademic year. Table 4 provides the descriptive and comparative results for the dimensions 182 and overall score per socio-demographic and control variable. 183\n3.3 Relation between variables and the PercOV-S questionnaire. 184\nTable 5 outlines the results of the multiple linear regressions. The first multivariate analysis 185 showed that the variables studying medicine or psychology, masculine gender, previous 186 experience in maternity services, being present at a woman\u2019s birth between 1-4 years or > 4 187 years, observing different treatment according to ethnic group and already knowing the 188 obstetric violence concept explained 36.5% of the variance of the overall PercOV-S score 189 (R2=0.365; R2 adjusted=0.266; estimation error=0.57; Durbin-Watson=1.739; F=3.667; 190 p=0.002). 191\nIn the second multivariate analysis, the variables studying nursing or medicine, being present 192 at a woman\u2019s birth < 1 year or > 4 years and already knowing the obstetric violence concept 193 explained 98.7% of the variance in the score for the dimension obstetric violence 194 protocolised-visible (R2=0.987; R2 adjusted=0.954; estimation error=0.247; Durbin-195 Watson=1.592; F=30.325; p=0.032). 196\nThe third multivariate analysis demonstrated that masculine gender, studying medicine or 197 psychology, previous experience in maternity services, being present at a woman\u2019s birth, 198 already knowing the obstetric violence concept, and noting different treatment for being 199 immigrants explained 19.3% of the variance of the score for the dimension obstetric violence 200 non-protocolised-invisible (R2=0.193; R2 adjusted=0.126; estimation error=0.6; Durbin-201 Watson=1.906; F=2.866; p=0.01). 202\n4. Discussion 203\n11\nThis study enabled us to evaluate how health sciences (medicine, psychology, nursing, 204 midwifery) students perceived obstetric violence with the PercOV-S tool (Mena-Tudela et al., 205 2020a). The overall PercOV-S results indicated a generalised moderate perception, which was 206 substantially lower on the dimension where obstetric violence was protocolised or visible, 207 with a score obtained with considerable obstetric violence perception for the non-208 protocolised or invisible dimension. This measurement of the health sciences students\u2019 209 baseline obstetric violence perception is key to action. 210\nWhen examining our results in more detail, students in midwifery (Leal et al., 2018) and 211 nursing degrees reported a higher obstetric perception for almost all items, and for the 212 dimensions and overall questionnaire score, than students studying medicine and psychology 213 degrees. One possible reason is that while medicine students are educated in a more 214 biomedical paradigm, where a biomechanical and medicalised approach towards birth 215 predominates (Hopkins et al., 2018; Twenge, 2009), midwifery and nursing students tend to 216 receive basic training that centres on a salutogenesis paradigm (Malone et al., 2016), where 217 salutogenesis is understood as a concept which postulates that life experiences help to shape 218 the coherence sense from an overall orientation perspective (Mittelmark and Bauer, 2017). 219 Changing the education approach in relation to women\u2019s sexual and reproduction health 220 physiology, including breastfeeding, towards a more women-centred approach for medical 221 students could possibly change perceived obstetric violence (Hearn et al., 2019; Hopkins et 222 al., 2018). Hence evaluating the overall perception, and assessing both items and dimensions, 223 could allow specific learning strategies to be devised in less recognised areas like obstetric 224 violence to accomplish improvements in information, education and awareness raising 225 among health sciences students in relation to obstetric violence problems (Swahnberg et al., 226 2019). This area is a recommendation for future research. 227\n12\nThe analysis of obstetric violence perceptions per academic year gave very interesting results. 228 We observed for both the nursing and midwifery degrees, academic year was later and more 229 obstetric violence was perceived. Exactly the opposite occurred with medicine, where two 230 important points are relevant: (a) feminisation of midwifery and nursing professions; (b) the 231 normalisation of obstetric violence in students\u2019 learning . In this way, women represent 70% 232 of health care workers worldwide and 80% of nurses in most regions (Boniol et al., 2019). In 233 addition, previous studies have found that perceptions of obstetric violence decrease with 234 advancing training (Mena-Tudela et al., 2020b). No significant differences appeared in 235 psychology. Perhaps psychology syllabi do not cover specific aspects related to childbirth and 236 perinatal mental health, which could explain these results. 237\nBoth midwifery and nursing professions and studies are feminised; that is, a high percentage 238 of their students/professionals are women (Boniol et al., 2019; Hung et al., 2019). It is 239 important to consider this aspect because these women could have had personal obstetric 240 violence experiences and, therefore, more sensitively detect this problem. It is also plausible 241 that although they had not suffered obstetric violence, women may have a more empathic 242 capacity (Esquerda et al., 2016) because they could find themselves in a similar vulnerable 243 situation to those situations indicated in the PercOV-S questionnaire. We should consider 244 possible gender biases in syllabi (Hung et al., 2019). At this point, it is necessary to reflect on 245 the gendered shame concept. Spain has a considerable problem with obstetric violence 246 (Mena-Tudela et al., 2020c), which may become more serious if women who feel shame tend 247 to hide their oppressive experiences from others and experience them alone (Cohen Shabot 248 and Korem, 2018). Unintentionally, the feminisation of health sciences studies can form a 249 silent vicious circle that hinders political struggle or social change (Cohen Shabot and Korem, 250 2018). Obstetric violence is nurtured and fortified by gendered shame (Cohen Shabot and 251\n13\nKorem, 2018). Future research should focus on empathy and gendered shame and explore 252 whether these concepts are related to students respond to obstetric violence in health 253 sciences students. 254\nThis research does not suggest that medical students perform acts of obstetric violence 255 intentionally, but might be influenced by perpetuating existing structural violence through 256 their teaching (Cohen Shabot and Korem, 2018; Farmer et al., 2006). 257\nNormalising obstetric violence as part of health sciences students\u2019 learning might also be 258 related to the learning paradigm in which students acquire basic university education if 259 obstetric violence is considered part of structural violence. The need for obstetric violence 260 training for health sciences students has been reinforced by others (RODA-Parents in Action, 261 2019; \u0160imonovi\u0107, 2019). It is essential for this learning to be received in a positive context so 262 as to not perpetuate obstetric violence. 263\nThe relational autonomy concept is critical (Cohen Shabot, 2020). This concept attaches 264 importance to relationships when executing autonomy. According to these personal 265 relationships and social links, it is something that is vital and indivisible of a person and, 266 therefore, of the autonomy capacity (Busquets Gallego, 2019). Students are capable of 267 justifying disrespectful and abusive care while women give birth (Rominski et al., 2017). By 268 considering this relational autonomy, research should be conducted into how health sciences 269 students\u2019 learning impacts obstetric violence with their tutors, teachers and/or superiors. The 270 traditional hierarchical structure between male doctors and female midwives and nurses still 271 exists in many places. It is necessary to explore how relational autonomy can influence the 272 learning and normalisation of obstetric violence because this kind of autonomy reinforces the 273\n14\nhorizontality of human relations (Busquets Gallego, 2019). All this discussion appears to be 274 reflected in the obtained multivariate models. 275\nWe should reflect on how obstetric violence is perceived according to the ethnic group, socio-276 economic status and/or the immigrant condition of the woman giving birth. Normalising 277 obstetric violence also involves such details because learning also offers more disparities of 278 care to minority groups of women can occur (Bryant et al., 2010; de Oliveira Ribeiro et al., 279 2020). Indeed female nurses and midwives, and the academy, can no longer be accomplices 280 of silencing structural, individual and ideological racism (Burnett et al., 2020). Remaining 281 silent is not acting neutrally and breaking down racism in the education of future health 282 professionals becomes a professional obligation (Burnett et al., 2020). 283\nAlthough the obtained results might guide educators, the academy and future research, they 284 must be interpreted cautiously because of some limitations. The main limitation lies in 285 collecting data with a self-administered online questionnaire because it can lead to lower 286 response rates. Fewer medical students participated and they could have been influenced by 287 this study being promoted by nurses. This was not a randomised study and was conducted in 288 only two institutions. Despite these limitations, the obtained results are interesting because 289 they reveal that health students consider obstetric violence and also adds value because it 290 indicates future research is needed. 291\nConclusions 292\nHealth Sciences students perceive obstetric violence to different extents depending on 293 whether the violence is protocolised/visible or non\u2013protocolised/invisible. Students\u2019 enrolled 294 degree may be related to perceived obstetric violence as nursing and midwifery students 295 obtained higher scores for the PercOV-S questionnaire overall score, dimensions and items. 296\n15\nMedical students score lower on both the overall PercOV-S questionnaire and on the 297 dimensions (protocolised/visible or non-protocolised/invisible). As obstetric violence 298 becomes integrated and normalised while academic years pass by with medical degree 299 students, it should be studied. There is a need to highlight a greater perception of obstetric 300 violence among female students, awareness of the concept of obstetric violence, ethnicity, 301 immigrant status and/or socio-economic status of the woman being treated. These 302 considerations can help to devise specific syllabi to offer obstetric violence training according 303 to the areas where obstetric violence is less perceived. 304\nReferences 305\nBhattacharya, S., Sundari Ravindran, T.K., 2018.
