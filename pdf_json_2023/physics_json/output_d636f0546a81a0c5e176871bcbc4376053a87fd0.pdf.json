    "abstractText": "Sunburn is caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun, resulting in redness of the skin as well as tenderness, swelling, and blistering issues. During the healing process, it can cause peeling, irritation, and some long-term effects, including premature aging, pigmentation, and a high risk of skin cancer. Rutin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which could potentially reduce inflammation and soothe sunburned skin. The objective of the current proposal is to develop and create carbopol gel-encased glycerosomes for the treatment of sunburn. The Design of Expert (DoE) technique was used to optimize the proposed formulation and was subjected to various characterization parameters such as nanovesicles size, polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge, entrapment efficiency (EE), and surface morphology. The optimized rutin-loaded glycerosomes (opt-RUT-loaded-GMs) were further characterised for drug release, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The formulation showed sustained release, greater permeation into the skin, and good antioxidant activity. The dermatokinetic study of opt-RUT-loaded-GMs confirms that the Rutin hydrate had better retention in the epidermis as compared to the dermis, owing to its potential for long lasting protection after topical application. It was observed that the prepared formulation was stable, highly safe, and had good sun protection factor (SPF) values that could be used as a suitable option for topical drug administration to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs.",

Although it plays a vital role in the production of vitamin D and is beneficial in the treatment of conditions such as psoriasis, dermatitis, and jaundice, prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation poses significant hazards. Chronic UV radiation exposure can lead to various adverse effects, including sunburn, erythema, inflammation, photoaging, and increased radiation levels. Among the different types of UV rays, ultraviolet-A (UV-A 320\u2013400 nm) and ultraviolet-B (UV-B 290\u2013320 nm) rays are particularly responsible for causing skin damage. While the ozone layer provides protection against the most harmful ultraviolet-C (UV-C 100\u2013280 nm) rays, UV-B (over 5%) and UVA (approximately 90\u201395%) radiation penetrate through to the Earth\u2019s surface, thereby impacting ecosystems and human well-being. Consequently, exposure to UV radiation can exert a significant influence on human health [1].\nGels 2023, 9, 752. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9090752 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 752 2 of 21\nAs the main cause of suntan, erythema, and sunburn, UV-B radiation poses the greatest damage to human skin. The DNA of keratinocytes absorbs UV-B radiation when applied to human skin. Products containing sunscreen are used to protect against UV-A and UV-B radiation. Currently, sunscreens employ a combination of absorption, scattering, and reflection mechanisms to counteract UV energy. They incorporate both physically and chemically based agents for effective sun protection. Physical sunblocks contain substantial concentrations of zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), which efficiently absorb UV-A and UV-B rays. However, frequent use of these chemicals can potentially harm the skin. Studies have shown that zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative DNA damage. As a result, there is growing interest in evaluating the antioxidant activity of plant-based products and employing natural antioxidants in skincare and cosmetics. Herbal extracts such as Rutin (RUT) (Figure 1) containing vitamins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids hold promise as potential ingredients in various pharmaceutical products aimed at enhancing skin health, including sunscreens. The development of a natural antioxidant is crucial to effectively protect the skin, as the primary factor contributing to the destruction of skin cells following UV exposure is the generation of reactive oxygen species [2].\nGels 2023, 9, x 2 of 23\nAs the main cause of suntan, erythema, and sunburn, UV-B radiation poses the\ngreatest da age to human skin.

Analysis of Response Surfaces Impact of Independent Factor on Vesicle Size (Y1)\nA quadratic polynomial equation aims to explain the effect of the concentration of phospholipid, cholesterol, and glycerol on vesicle size, as shown in Table S2. The size of\nGels 2023, 9, 752 5 of 21\nthe GM vesicles was significantly influenced favorably by the phospholipid concentrations. The developed formulation\u2019s vesicle size analyses indicated a size range of 112.15 \u00b1 4.03 nm to 186.16 \u00b1 9.04 nm. The vesicle size at low phospholipid concentration (40 mg) was found to be 112.15 \u00b1 4.03 nm (F17), and when the phospholipid concentration was increased to 50 mg, a significant increase in vesicle size was found to be at 149.95 \u00b1 5.01 nm (F8). Whereas the increase in phospholipid concentration to 60 mg resulted in an increase in vesicle size to 186.16 \u00b1 9.04 nm (F3) as shown in Table S1. The final result was comparable to the previously reported result [12]. The size of GM vesicles was favorably impacted by the cholesterol concentration. Vesicle size increased as cholesterol concentration rose from 2.5 to 7.5% w/v. The vesicle size was less positively affected by the glycerol concentration. The vesicle size increases when glycerol concentration rises from 1 to 3% as shown in Table S1. The reduction in vesicle size at the same glycerol concentration, may be the result of the combined action of cholesterol and phospholipid, as the content of aqueous glycerol increased, the viscous fluid of glycerol induced an increase in vesicle formation [13].\nInfluence of Independent Factor on PDI\nThe quadratic equation observed for polydispersity index is shown in Table S2. The model has been determined to be significant with model F value of 29,560.93. The \u201cLack of Fit F-value\u201d 6.41 indicates that it was non-significant. The \u201cPredicted R2\u201d of 0.9996 and the \u201cAdjusted R2\u201d of 0.9999 had a respectable degree of correlation. PdI values for RUT-loadedGMs prepared according to the experimental design ranged between 0.194 \u00b1 0.003 and 0.395 \u00b1 0.0006. These indications indicate a linear model for glycerosome polydispersity index analysis. All of the formulations had polydispersity index values that were less than 0.3, except for F16, which had a PDI value of 0.395 and demonstrated issues with a wider range size distribution and agglomeration. The effects of individual parameters on PdI were observed using the response Y2 coded quadratic equation. PdI was observed to rise significantly as the concentration of phospholipid 90G, cholesterol and glycerol continued to increase.\nInfluence of Independent Factor on EE%\nThe observed quadratic equation for % EE is displayed in Table S2. The model has been determined to be significant with model F value of 1512.66. The \u201cLack of Fit F-value\u201d 4.0 indicates that it was non-significant. The \u201cPredicted R2\u201d of 0.9988 and the \u201cAdjusted R2\u201d of 0.9936 had a respectable degree of correlation. The range of entrapment efficiency for the optimized RUT-loaded-GMs formulation was found to be 97.18 \u00b1 2.47% to 98.0 \u00b1 1.30%. The concentration of phospholipid, cholesterol, and glycerol has a favorable effect on the %EE. It was observed that formulation entrapment was enhanced when phospholipid concentration increased from 40 to 60 mg, cholesterol concentration from 2% to 7.5% w/v, and glycerol concentration from 1 to 3% as seen in Table S1.\n2.3.2. Experimental Design Validation\nThe consistency between predicted and experimental values is utilized to evaluate the validity of the optimization strategy. predicted values of the individual runs are presented in Table S1. The optimal formulation\u2019s composition was established using the observed results from the responses. The software also produced the optimal formulation\u2019s expected responses, which were compared to the optimized experimental formulation. In the BBDoptimized formula, 50 mg of phospholipid, 5 mg of cholesterol, and 2% of glycerol were included.

The findings showed a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values.

Determination of Entrapment Efficiency\nThe opt-RUT-loaded-GMs entrapment efficiency was determined to be 82.81 \u00b1 3.85%. The hydrophilic nature of rutin hydrate is a significant factor in entrapment, whereby an increase in phospholipid concentration can effectively enhance its entrapment into the lipid bilayer. Furthermore, elevation of the cholesterol concentration yields an augmented rigid bilayer architecture, thereby impeding the efflux of the drug from the GMs and ultimately leading to superior drug loading.\nGels 2023, 9, 752 7 of 21\n2.4.3. Morphological Evaluation\nThe transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the opt-RUT-loaded-GMs indicates that the individual vesicles exhibit a smooth, uniform, and spherical morphology, with a diameter below 150 nm (Figure 3C). The confirmation of the nano size of the generated GMs is supported by the TEM images, thereby corroborating the results obtained from the Zetasizer particle size measurement.\n2.4.4. Differential Scanning Calorimetry\nThe DSC (Pyris 6 Perkin Elmer, USA) analysis of the rutin hydrate showed an extremely strong peak at 177.062 \u25e6C (Figure 4A) that verified the crystalline nature and the purity of the drug sample. The DSC thermogram for the blank opt-GMs formulation demonstrated only one peak (Figure 4B) at 170.264 \u25e6C which was found to be consistent with the peak of the cryoprotectant mannitol used to lyophilize the prepared GMs. Moreover, the optRUT-loaded-GMs indicated one peak (Figure 4C), which belonged to the cryoprotectant mannitol, at 171.1 \u25e6C. The findings indicated that there was no drug leakage or precipitate from the produced formulation of opt-RUT-loaded-GMs because no peak of the free drug was seen and the drug was completely encapsulated in GMs in an amorphous form.\nGels 2023, 9, x 8 of 23\n2.4.2.

The antioxidant activity of the rutin hydrate and the ascorbic acid were found to be 80.23 \u00b1 1.563% and 87.21 \u00b1 2.07%, respectively. Whereas the rutin hydrate and the ascorbic acid had IC50 values of 69.41 \u00b5g/mL and 65.61 \u00b5g/mL, respectively [18].

The particle size of the formed Opt-RUT-loaded-GMs fell within the appropriate range for the intended use of topical delivery. The zeta potential analysis demonstrated that the formulation exhibited good stability. The incorporation of the API into the prepared Opt-RUT-loaded-GMs was confirmed by the results obtained from DSC and XRD studies. While the FTIR confirmed the API-excipient compatibility. Glycerosomes provided better penetration in comparison with the suspension. The Opt-RUT-loaded-GMs showed sustained release and good stability. Better penetration of glycerosomal gel than conventional gel was observed in a dermatokinetics study. Furthermore, the formulation was assessed for its potential in treating sunburn, which demonstrated effectiveness in treating sunburn, exhibiting a desirable sun protection factor (SPF) value and displaying favorable antioxidant properties. The formulation is determined to be suitable for safe administration via topical delivery as confirmed by a skin irritation study. Results confirmed that the formulated gel has the potential to maintain stability over prolonged periods when stored under normal conditions."

In our study, an Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram was employed to establish the cause-effect relationship between different factors [27].\n4.2.2. Preparation of RUT-Glycerosomes (RUT-GMs)\nThe thin film hydration approach was employed for the preparation of RUT-loadedGMs [28]. Cholesterol (5.0 mg/mL), phospholipid 90G (50.0 mg/mL), and RUT (5 mg/mL) were accurately measured and dissolved in chloroform with 1% methanol. The resulting mixture was mechanically stirred at 40 \u25e6C for one hour. Subsequently, the mixture was evaporated using a rotary evaporator (Hahnshin Scientific Co., Bucheon, Republic of Korea, HS-2005V-N) under reduced pressure, leading to the formation of a clear lipid film on the rounded bottom of the flask. The transparent lipid film allowed for the removal of residual solvents overnight under a vacuum. To hydrate the RUT-loaded-GMs, a glycerol-water solution (20% w/v glycerol) was used, and the two phases were mechanically stirred at 40 \u25e6C for one hour. The vesicles were then subjected to sonication for half cycle, which equated to 60 s, with a 3 s pause every 15 s. To remove any excess unentrapped drug, the resulting formulation was centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u25e6C before being lyophilized for future use [3].\n4.2.3. Optimization of RUT-Loaded-GMs\nThe utilization of Design of Experiment (DOE) has been implemented in the development of glycerosomes. The optimization of RUT-loaded-GMs was conducted using the Box\u2013Behnken design, which is a statistical experimental design technique that involves three factors with three levels each. The Design-Expert software (Version 12, Stat-Ease, MN, USA) was utilized for this purpose. The study aimed to optimize various process parameters, namely Phospholipid 90G (X1), cholesterol (X2), and Glycerol (X3), to assess their impact on the vesicle size (Y1), polydispersity index (Y2), and entrapment efficiency (Y3) of glycerosomes (Table S1). The independent variables were changed at low (\u2212), medium (0), and high (+) concentrations in order to determine the optimal composition. The design illustrated a total of 17 formulation runs, each with distinct compositions, and included 5 center points to assess the impact of independent variables. The impact of independent variables was assessed through the examination of both the polynomial equation and response surface plot. The quadratic model was determined to be the optimal model due to its utilization of variables that demonstrated both individual and combined effects on the dependent variables.\n4.2.4. Characterization of Opt-RUT-Loaded-GMs Vesicle Size, PDI and Zeta Potential\nTo measure the vesicle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential the dynamic light scattering was employed using the Malvern Zetasizer, Nano ZS, Oxford, UK. Before analyzing the aforementioned parameters, the formulation was diluted 50 times approximately. The scattering angle was set at 90\u25e6 and the temperature was held constant at about 25 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C. Prior to experimentation, distilled water served as a control for the undiluted formulations. The study was conducted in triplicate to ensure reliability [28,29].\nEntrapment Efficiency\nUsing the ultracentrifugation method, the entrapment effectiveness of the opt-RUTloaded-GMs was assessed. A 10 mL glass centrifuge tube was filled with 2 mL of the formulation after the formulating glycerosomal preparation. The prepared formulation was diluted with distilled water to 5 mL and centrifuged (C-24 BL; Remi Instruments Ltd., Vasai, India) at 2000 rpm for 20 min while using a cooling centrifuge to separate the undissolved drug from the formulation. Ultracentrifugation was then performed for 30 min at 10,000 rpm to isolate the glycerosomes. The supernatant was collected from the\nGels 2023, 9, 752 15 of 21\npellets after centrifugation, and the amount of unentrapped drug was determined utilizing a UV spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 259 nm (Shimadzu-UV-1601). A UV calibration curve was generated for Rutin, which followed the formula: y = 0.0257x + 0.0358, where x represents absorbance and y represents rutin concentration. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the calibration curve was determined to be 0.99. Rutin content in glycerosomal formulation was determined by dividing the amount of drug entrapped (total drug added to formulation-free drug in supernatant) by the total amount of drug added during formulation preparation [30]. The below equation was used to calculate the entrapment efficiency.\nEntrapment efficinecy% = total drug \u2212 free drug\ntotal drug \u00d7 100 (1)\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetery\nThe nature and entrapment of RUT was confirmed by performing Differential Scanning Calorimetery (Pyris 6 Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for drug samples and opt-RUT-loaded-GMs. A small portion of the sample was quickly sealed in an aluminum pan. The instrument was adjusted to a temperature range of 40 to 400 \u25e6C. The samples were heated at 10 \u25e6C/min using a nitrogen flow of 60 mL/min. 5% of mannitol was added as a cryoprotectant prior to freeze-drying the opt-RUT-loaded-GMs formulation for lyophilization [29].\nFourier Transform Infrared Compatibility Study\nAn FT-IR spectrometer was used to obtain FT-IR spectra (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Potassium bromide was mixed separately with the pure API-RUT, blank opt-GMs formulation containing all excipients such as Phospholipon 90G, glycerine and cholesterol, and opt-RUT-loaded-GMs formulation (after lyophilization). The powders were compressed at a pressure of 15 tons for 10 min in a hydraulic press to create the potassium bromide discs and scanned from 4000 to 400 cm\u22121 [31].\nX-ray Diffraction\nAn X-ray diffractometer (Pan Analytical, IIT Delhi, India) was used to assess the drug\u2019s encapsulation with a scattering angle range of 20\u201380\u25e6. The diffractometer functioned at a voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively, and a rate of 0.6 min\u22121 was used to take the measurements. Rutin hydrate and opt-RUT-loaded-GMs that had been lyophilized had their XRD patterns identified utilizing the Origin software [16].\nSurface Morphology of Opt-RUT-Loaded-GMs\nTransmission electron microscopy (CRYO-TEM (TALOS S), Thermo Sceintific, Waltham, MA, USA.) was utilized to assess the surface morphology of the opt-RUT-loaded-GMs. A drop of prepared vesicular solution was placed on a carbon-copper coated grid and 1% phosphotungstic acid was used to negatively stain the sample. To prevent evaporation, the vesicular solution was applied to a carbon-coated TEM grid for 10 min in a moist environment, then, the surplus liquid was drained with filter paper. The prepared samples were observed using Transmission Electron Microscope and images for vesicular nanoparticles were captured [32].\nDetermination of Antioxidant Activity by 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl Assay\nThe standard 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) technique was used to assess the antioxidant potential of RUT. The DPPH free radical method is widely used to evaluate a compound\u2019s antioxidant potential. The electron-donating ability of antioxidants causes the violet-colored DPPH solution to turn colorless at room temperature. The standard in this assay was ascorbic acid (Merck, Mumbai, India). The sample (0.5 mL) was first dissolved in 3 mL of methanol before being treated with 0.3 mL of DPPH methanolic solution. The resulting reaction mixture was allowed to continue reacting for an additional hour in a\nGels 2023, 9, 752 16 of 21\ndark environment. The color change indicates the sample\u2019s antioxidant potential as a result of its hydrogen-donating ability. The blank contained 3.3 mL of methanol and 0.3 mL of sample, whereas the control contained 3.5 mL of methanol and DPPH solution (0.3 mL). At 517 nm, the sample was spectrophotometrically (Shimadzu-UV-1601) examined.\nScavenging % = Absorbance of control \u2212 Absorbance of sample\nAbsorbance of control \u00d7 100 (2)\nA graph showing the percentage of DPPH scavenging activity vs. different RUT concentrations was used to calculate the IC50 value for API (concentration at which it shows 50% of antioxidant activity) [9].\n4.2.5. Preparation of Opt-RUT-Loaded-GMs Carbopol\u00ae Gel\nThe gelling ingredient carbopol\u00ae 934P NF (Lubrizol Advanced Materials. Inc., Mumbai, India). was utilized for preparing gel formulations. The required carbopol\u00ae powder (1%) was dissolved in distilled water and was kept overnight for proper mixing. The next day, 2\u20134 drops of triethanolamine were added to the carbopol\u00ae mixture with continuous stirring, which led to the formation of a gel base due to the alteration in pH. Then, prepared opt-RUT-loaded-GMs were mixed with the gel base under continuous gentle stirring to prevent any bubble formation. Then, gel samples were continuously stirred for 60 min on a magnetic stirrer and opt-RUT-loaded-GMs Carbopol\u00ae gel was obtained [33].\n4.2.6. Characterization of Opt-RUT-Loaded-GMs Gel pH Evaluation\nOne gram of Opt-RUT-loaded-GMs gel formulation was weighed in a 50 mL volumetric flask and diluted with double distilled water and left for 2 h. The pH of the gel formulation was measured using a glass microelectrode (Mettler Instruments, Giessen, Germany) by keeping it in contact with the diluted gel for 1 min. Three distinct batches of gels were tested.\nHomogeneity and Viscosity\nAll the gel formulations were transferred in transparent containers and were visually inspected for homogeneity. It was examined for the appearance of any type of aggregates in the gel formulation [34]. The viscosity of the prepared Opt-RUT-loaded-GMs gel was determined utilizing Brookfield viscometer using spindle no. 64 at 10 rpm and temperature of 25 \u25e6C [35].\nSpreadability\nThe Opt-RUT-loaded-GMs gel spreadability was assessed utilizing the parallel plate technique. In this experimental protocol, a circular area with a diameter of 1 cm was marked on a glass plate, and 500 mg of the formulated gel was subsequently applied onto this area. Another glass plate was then placed on top of the gel. A duration of 5 min was allocated for the placement of a weight measuring 500 g onto the upper plate of the glass. The expansion of the diameter was observed as a result of the spreading of the gel [24]. The entire procedure was repeated three times (n = 3), and the average time of the three trials was used in subsequent calculations.\nThe following formula was used to determine the spreadability.\nS = M \u00d7 L\nT (3)\nwhere L is the diameter of the spreaded gel, S is spreadability (g/s), M is the weight attached to top slides (gm), and T is time (s).\nGels 2023, 9, 752 17 of 21\nExtrudability\nTo evaluate the formulation\u2019s extrudability, a closed, collapsible tube\u2019s crimped end was forcibly squeezed utilizing weights. The formulation was extruded once the cap was taken off until the pressure subsided. The weight in grams required to extrude a 0.5 cm ribbon of the gel formulation in 10 s was calculated. The results were made in regard to the average extrusion pressure in grams i.e., n = 3 [36].\nTexture Analysis\nThe gel was examined using a back extruding probe of 30 nm diameter in a texture analyzer (TA-XT2T Plus Texture Analyzer, StableMicro Systems Ltd., Surrey, UK). The consistency firmness, cohesiveness, consistency, and viscosity index were all determined using this technique [24].\n4.2.7. In Vitro Release\nThe in vitro release study of opt-RUT-loaded-GMs gel was carried out using a dialysis method. The pre-activated dialysis bag (MW-12 kDa) was utilized, both opt-RUT-loadedGMs and RUT suspension was added to the bag following both the ends were tied using sealing clips. Phosphate buffer saline (pH 5.5, 250 mL) was used as dissolution media to immerse the dialysis bags in a 500 mL beaker. The beaker was then placed on a magnetic stirrer maintained at a temperature of 37.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u25e6C and a moving speed of 100 rpm. A 1 mL sample aliquots were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24-h intervals. In order to equalize the sink conditions, the receiver compartment received 1 mL of fresh dissolution medium. The drug content of the withdrew samples were measured using UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-UV-1601) at 259 nm following dilutions [9,20]. The drug release kinetics of the formulation was accessed by fitting the data into different kinetic models (zero order, first order, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas). The correlation coefficient (R2) for each model was calculated using the above-mentioned equations. Validated UV method in phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) was used for the quantification of drug released in the dissolution media having regression coefficient of 0.9743, limit of detection: 1.156 \u00b5g/mL, and limit of quantification: 3.503 \u00b5g/mL (n = 3).\n4.2.8. Sun Protection Factor Value Determination\nThe UV-VIS spectrophotometry was used to determine the effectiveness of RUT as sunscreen prepared into opt-RUT-loaded-GMs gel formulation and RUT suspension. The gel formulation and suspension were divided into different concentrations, F1 = 0.02%, F2 = 0.05%, and F3 = 0.1%. Each concentration was measured at intervals of 5 nm between 290 and 320 nm utilizing a UV-spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-UV-1601). Distilled water was utilized as a blank. The SPF value was determined using the absorbance value obtained for samples at different concentrations [22].\nSPF = CF \u00d7 \u2211290320 EE (\u03bb) \u00d7 I (\u03bb) \u00d7 absorbance (\u03bb) CF = Correction factor (10) EE = Erythmogenic effect of radiation with wavelength \u03bb I = Solar Ray Simulation Spectrum Abs = spectrophotometric absorbance values at wavelength \u03bb.\n4.2.9. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy\nThe study was performed on abdominal skin of rats to determine the penetration potential of GMs gel formulation. The opt-GMs gel formulation containing 0.02% w/v Rhodamine B dye and hydroethanolic solution of Rhodamine B dye was applied to rat skin in a non-occlusive manner fixed on Franz diffusion cell (donor chamber volume: 3 mL, receiver chamber volume: 10 mL, and a surface area of 1.76 cm2, manufactured by Rama Scientific, Delhi, India). The skin was maintained at 37.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u25e6C with continuous stirring at 100 RPM for 8 h. The treated skin was taken out of the diffusion device after 8 h and rinsed with PBS solution to remove any leftover hydroalcoholic solution and adhering\nGels 2023, 9, 752 18 of 21\nformulation. After being longitudinally cut with a microtome, the samples were mounted on glass slides. Confocal Lasser Scanning Microscopy (Leica Microsystem, TCS SPE; Milton Keynes, UK) was used to examine the fluorescent intensity of Rhodamine B dye on the slides. The sample was scanned through the z-axis using an Argon laser with excitation and emission wavelengths of 540 nm and 625 nm, respectively [17].\n4.2.10. Ex Vivo Dermatokinetics\nThe goal of the investigation was to determine the drug\u2019s quantitative concentration in rat skin. A dermatokinetic study was conducted to determine the concentration of the drug in the epidermis and dermis layers of rat skin. The analysis was carried out by applying opt-RUT-loaded-GMs gel formulation and RUT suspension to prepared rat skin that had already been fixed on Franz diffusion cells (donor chamber volume: 3 mL, receiver chamber volume: 10 mL and a surface area of 1.76 cm2). After 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 h, the entire skin sample was removed from the assembly. The formulation was adhered to the removed skin samples and was rinsed off three times with normal saline, and then the sample was immersed in warm water (60 \u25e6C) for 2\u20133 min. Following this, the epidermal and dermal layers of the rat\u2019s skin were sliced separately, depauperated with 5 mL of methanol for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C, and the drug was completely extracted. The methanol solution was then filtered through a 0.25 \u00b5m pore size nylon syringe-driven filter, and the RUT content was determined in triplicate using UV spectroscopy (Shimadzu-UV-1601). Non-compartment dermatokinetics was used to calculate the concentration of RUT in each sample at each time point. PK solver software was used to estimate dermatokinetic parameters such as Cskin-max, AUC0\u20138 h, Ke, and Tskin-max [37]. Validated UV method in methanol was used for the quantification of drug concentration in different skin samples having regression coefficient of 0.9932, limit of detection: 1.310 \u00b5g/mL, and limit of quantification: 3.971 \u00b5g/mL (n = 3).\n4.2.11. In Vivo Study\nThe Central Animal House, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India, vetted ethical compliance in animal handling. The approval for animal experimentation was granted by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC), Jamia Hamdard vide Protocol Number: 2055. The committee is registered with the Committee for the purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) (173/GO/ReBi/S/2000/CCSEA 28 January 2000). The adult Wistar rats weighing in the range of 210\u2013250 g were placed in polypropylene cages in the animal house adhering to IAEC and CPCSEA guidelines.\nSkin Irritation Study\nThe Draize patch test was employed to investigate the potential irritation at the site of application. The study employed adult Wistar rats as experimental subjects. The dorsal region of the rats was shaved using a electrical clipper and razor. The rats were subjected to a 24-h period of observation to monitor for any injuries that may have been caused. The following day, a gel containing 0.5 g of opt-RUT-loaded-GMs was applied to the shaved area. The negative control group did not undergo any treatment, while the positive control group was treated with a 0.8% formalin solution. Erythema and edema were observed at various time intervals. The Draize scoring system was employed, utilizing a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 denoting the absence of erythema and edema, and 4 indicating the most severe manifestation of erythema and edema [38].\n4.2.12. Accelerated Stability Study According to ICH Q1A (R2) Guidelines\nA stability investigation was performed on the optimized RUT-loaded GM liquid formulation and gel formulation to evaluate whether there will be any physical or chemical changes during storage. The formulation was stored for 3 months in a Borosil ambercolored glass container at 40 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C, 75 \u00b1 5%RH and 4 \u00b1 0.5 \u25e6C for a stability assessment. Following storage, samples were obtained at 0-day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months,\nGels 2023, 9, 752 19 of 21\nand 3 months intervals. Various parameters such vesicle size, PDI, % entrapment efficiency, physical appearance, color, phase separation, clarity, pH, homogeneity and washability were then used to determine the stability [39].\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/gels9090752/s1, Figure S1: Response surface plots showing the relative impacts of independent variables i.e., Phospho-lipid 90G conc.
