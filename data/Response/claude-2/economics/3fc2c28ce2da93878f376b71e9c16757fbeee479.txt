 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of government policies and regulations on renewable energy adoption in BRI countries. The paper mentions the importance of supportive policies but does not analyze their effects in depth. Future research could investigate how specific policy tools like feed-in tariffs or carbon pricing influence renewable energy investment in the BRI region. 

2. Conduct case studies on renewable energy development in individual BRI countries. The paper analyzes BRI countries broadly, but case studies on countries leading in renewables (e.g. China) or struggling with adoption (e.g. Kazakhstan) could provide more nuanced insights. 

3. Evaluate the role of public-private partnerships in facilitating renewable energy financing and development in BRI nations. The paper cites access to finance as an obstacle, so researching innovative models like public-private partnerships for funding projects could be useful.

4. Examine the impact of multilateral development banks and international aid programs on clean energy transitions in the BRI region. The paper does not analyze this factor, but aid money could potentially accelerate adoption.

5. Develop forecasting models to predict future renewable energy capacity and investment in BRI countries based on economic factors like financial/trade openness. The paper is retrospective, but predictive models could help governments and businesses plan for energy transitions.
