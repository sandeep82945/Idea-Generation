A total of 420 women were selected by the simple random sampling technique and an intervieweradministered questionnaire was used for data collection. The data were entered to EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Univariable and mult- variable logistic regression analysis with their corresponding odds ratio (95%CI) were computed, and statistical significance was declared at p < 0.05.\nResults The magnitude of intimate partner violence among HIV-positive Women during Lifetime and since diagnosed with HIV was 49.29%, [(95% CI: 44.3\u201353.6%)] and 41.67%, [(95% CI: 37.1\u201345.7%)] respectively. Skipping daily ART medication \u2265 6 times/month [AOR = 3.56; (95% CI 1.18, 10.74)], experiencing controlling behavior by a partner[AOR = 6.37; (95% CI 3.26, 12.44)], women inter-parental witness of violence [AOR = 1.74; (95% CI 1.09, 2.79)], women having favorable attitude that justify wife-beating [AOR = 1.76; (95% CI 1.06, 2.94)]and non-disclosure of test result to partner [AOR 0.38; (95% CI 0.22, 0.66)] were factors associated with intimate partner violence since diagnosed with HIV.\nConclusion The magnitude of intimate partner violence among HIV-positive Women on ART follow-up was found to be high in the study area. Therefore, integrating intimate partner violence victim screening with ART services, empowering HIV-positive women, and increasing their awareness of sexual and reproductive rights is needed.\nKeywords Intimate partner violence, HIV/AIDS, Women, Ethiopia"

            "heading": "Background",
            "text": "Violence Against Women(VAW) is a violation of fundamental human rights, which is rooted in gender inequality. It is a public health problem, and an impediment to sustainable development [1]. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is one of the most common forms of violence against women. It refers to behavior within an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual, or psychological harm, including acts of physical aggression, sexual coercion, and psychological abuse, and controlling behavior [2]. IPV is now widely recognized as a serious human rights abuse [3]. While some women, including HIV positive women are more at risk than others, it can happen to any woman, in any country regardless of culture, religion, or economic status [4].\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 30% of ever-partnered women globally have experienced physical and/or sexual IPV, calling IPV a public health problem of epidemic proportions [5]. Women experiencing Violence face a 50% greater risk of HIV infection. The intersection between the two creates a dual epidemic [6, 7]. Also, IPV is one of the barriers to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) treatment initiation and adherence among HIV-positive women, which is a profound global challenge for health, development, and women\u2019s rights [4].\nStudies conducted in different part of the African countries imply that IPV among HIV positive women is a common phenomenon; The study conducted among HIV positive women in Uganda shows that, 32.1% of women experienced physical violence, 28.3% experienced sexual violence, and 44.2% experienced any IPV [8]. Also, a study conducted in Cameroon shows that, the prevalence of emotional violence was 29% while physical and sexual violence were 22% and 18% respectively [9]. A study conducted in Tanzania shows that 69% of respondents experienced emotional or physical violence, 31% experienced sexual violence and 65% reported a lifetime physical, emotional, or sexual violence [10]. In Ethiopia, a study conducted on HIV positive women on ART in Fitche, indicates that, the prevalence of lifetime IPV was 46%, while Physical, psychological, and sexual violence were 43.7%, 43.7%, and 25.1% respectively [11].\nThere are different predictors of experiencing IPV among HIV-positive women, including; partner age, presence of opportunistic infection, women\u2019s history of alcohol use, partner\u2019s history of a fight with another person, non-partner beating/physical mistreatment, controlling behaviors, alcohol drinking, interparental witness of violence, discosure of test result, and low income of women [8\u201315].\nViolence negatively affects women\u2019s physical and mental health and well-being. It has social and economic consequences and costs for families, communities, and\nsocieties [1]. Millions of women, girls, children, and young people who are exposed to or experience violence suffer a range of short and long-term consequences. These include physical injuries, mental health problems, a higher risk of non-communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health problems [16]. Violence or fear of violence has been implicated as a barrier to women seeking HIV testing and disclosure of HIV status [12]. If the relationship is characterized by abuse, or significant power disparities, the woman\u2019s ability to use these services and HIV infection prevention methods will be compromised. This leads to significantly lower ART use, lower ART adherence, and lower odds of viral load suppression among women [13].\nTo prevent intimate partner violence and its effects, national and international efforts were tried. Among such efforts; empowering women, transforming cultural and social norms related to gender, integrating VAW and HIV services, promoting and implementing laws and policies related to VAW, gender equality and HIV were the major strategies set globally to respond and address VAW and HIV/AIDS jointly. Even though such efforts were made, still the problem continues to be a major challenge and a threat to women\u2019s empowerment [2, 6].\nAlthough IPV and HIV/AIDS are a pervasive problem among women, different studies conducted in different countries including Ethiopia are not well targeted to HIV-positive women. So the main aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of intimate partner violence among HIV-positive women on ART, and identify its associated factors at Nekemte town public health facilities, western Ethiopia. The findings of the study will be vital for policy makers, program managers, service providers, and researchers."

Nekemte town is located at 331 Kilo Meters to the western direction from Ababa; Ethiopia. It is administratively subdivided into six administrative divisions and one rural kebele. In the year 2019, there are 26,538 households. The total population of the town is 132,711 out of these 65,028 males and 67,683 are females. There are 4,098 under one year, 20,930 under five years, 4, 420 pregnant women, and 23,731 non-pregnant women [17]. Regarding health facilities, there are 2 health centers, one specialized hospital, one referral hospital, two nongovenmrntal organizations clinics (Marie stopes international Ethioipia and Family Guidance Association Ethiopia). Besides these, there are also different private\nclinics in the town. Among those, all govermental health facilities provide ART services."

Seriously ill patients and patients who were unable to give responses were excluded from the study.\nSample size determination and sampling procedure The sample size was estimated using a single population proportion formula; by considering assumptions of the proportion of lifetime intimate partner violence among HIV-positive women Proportion = 46% from the study conducted in the Oromia region, Fitche, central Ethiopia [11], a marginal error of 5%, a non-response rate of 10, and a 95% confidence interval. After including the above assumptions into the formula, the final sample size becomes 420 women on ART follow-up. Clients on ART follow-up are those who take antiretroviral drugs regularly for the rest of their lives, because, ART cannot cure HIV infection.\nNekemte town has four governmental health facilities (two hospitals and two health centers). All the four governmental health facilities were included into the study. Then, the total sample size was proportionally allocated to those health facilities according to the number of patients fulfilling the eligiblity criteria found on their records. After the total numbers of the study participants from each facility were determined; computer-generated simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Eligible women who fulfill the inclusion criteria were assessed for lifetime experience of IPV and since diagnosed with HIV."

Physical violence was measured when women reported at least one experience of being slapped or having something thrown at her that could hurt her, being pushed or shoved, being hit with a fist or something else that could hurt, being kicked, dragged, or beaten up, being choked or burnt on purpose, and/or being threatened with, or, having a gun, knife or other weapons against her by the\ncurrent or former partner. Psychological violence/emotional violence occurred when the women reported at least one emotional violence item from the four questions listed in the WHO multi-country women and violence study questionnaire. It occurred when someone says or does something to make a person feel stupid or worthless. Sexual violence occured when women reported at least one experience of the three sexual violence questions. \u201cBeing physically forced to have sexual intercourse against her will, having sexual intercourse because she is afraid of what her partner might do, and being forced to do something sexual she found degrading or humiliating.\nFavorable attitude is when women agreed with at least one item of the six Women\u2019s Attitudes towards partner beating assessment questions set from WHO multi-country Women and violence study. In this study, HIV- positive women on ART follow-up is defined as HIV- positive women who had made at least one visit to the ART clinic before. ART treatment adherence/medication adherence was defined as; starting HIV treatment, keeping all medical appointments, and taking HIV medicines every day and exactly as prescribed. A woman is said to be adhered to ART treatment, if she take her medication every day, exactly as prescribed, and keep all medication appointments. Other wise, she was categorized as \u2018not adhered\u2019. In this study, controlling behavior occurred when an intimate partner/husbands of HIV-positive women/the respondent attempts to conform them/women to their own needs or desires through physical, sexual, and/or physicological harm. Exposure to care giver violence was occurred when HIV-postivive women are violated by their care gives atleast once during their life time and/ or since diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Non dislosure of test results to partner occurred when HIV-positive women/ respondents refuse to tell their HIV status to their intimate sexual partner, due to fear of violence.\nData collection tools and procedure A structured questionnaire was adapted from the WHO multi-country study on women\u2019s health and domestic violence against women, and modified based on the study variables and local context. It was first developed in English; then translated to Afan Oromo (regional language) and retranslated back to English by experts in both languages.\nThe questionnaire was composed of; socio-demographic characteristics of HIV-positive women on ART follow-up and their partners, magnitude and frequency of physical, emotional, and sexual violence, controlling behaviors, factors related to IPV, like clinical and behavioral factors of both women and partner. The questionnaire contains a total of 13 IPV-related questions (6 physical IPV-related questions, 4 emotional IPV-related questions, and 3 sexual IPV-related questions) to assess\nthe experience of women to the three constructs of IPV (physical, emotional, and sexual). Also, there are controlling behaviours related questions to determine the exposure of IPV.\nData was collected by four female nurses and supervised by 2 MPH holder supervisors. Two days training was given for data collectors and supervisors. Before the actual data collection, a pretest of the questionnaire was conducted to check consistency, understandability, and clarity of the tool. In addition, completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the filled questionnaire was checked each night by supervisors."

Also, the variation may be due to the difference between the sampling techniques of the study.\nOn the other hand, the magnitude of IPV since diagnosed with HIV/AIDS was 41.67% [95% CI: 37.4\u201345.7%]. This finding is nearly similar to the studies conducted in Wolayita zone, southern Ethiopia and Harare of Zimbabwe, which reported IPV among HIV-positive women of 44.2% and 40.5% respectively [8, 15].\nAdditionally, Psychological violence was the most common form of violence since diagnosed with HIV (38.09%), followed by physical violence (20.24%) and sexual violence (10.24%). It is in line with the study conducted in Wolaita, Ethiopia, which was 36.68% for psychological violence,28.57% for physical violence in the current/ within past twelve months [21], and the magnitude of physical violence among HIV-Positive women in Cameroon was 22% [9]. In contrast, this finding is greater than the result from Osogbo, Southwest Nigeria conducted on HIV-positive women since HIV diagnoses; which was 23.6% for IPV, 17.2% for physical, 21.4% for psychological, and 2% for sexual violence [22]. This variation may\nbe due to differences in the study setting and socio-economic differences among the study population.\nThe current study found that women witnessing interparental violence during their childhood increase the risk of experiencing IPV later in her life. This finding is in line with the research conducted in India and other countries [19, 23]. It has been suggested that witnessing inter-parental violence in early childhood has significant detrimental effects on the development of a child\u2019s brain, which can lead to social, emotional, and behavioral problems. This might put them to be a victim by tolerating interpersonal violence in later life [16]. Also, it leads to a normative understanding of violence, and intergeneration learned behavior that is accepted as a means of conflict resolution [24].\nWomen who skip their daily medication \u2265 6 times/ month were more likely to experience intimate partner violence. This result is in line with the previous research findings which indicate that IPV has a significant association with adherence to antiretroviral medication [13, 25]. This might be due to psychological disturbance that make a woman not adhere to her medication/not take her medication on time regularly.\nWomen who did not disclose their HIV status to their partners were less likely to experience violence.\nThe finding of this result is also in agreement with the research conducted in Osogbo, southwest Nigeria, Tanzania, and other studies, which shows, HIV-status disclosure increases the risk of IPV in women living with HIV [15, 22, 26, 27]. It has been suggested that violence can be the consequence of Women living with HIV disclosing their HIV status and facing stigma and discrimination [6]. However, non-disclosure of the result cannot be the means to end violence, since it has grave public health\nimplications, as it would promote the spread of the HIV/ AIDS epidemic.\nAccording to findings from this study, women who reported controlling behavior by intimate partners were at greater risk of experiencing IPV. This result is similar to other studies conducted in Fitche hospital, central Ethiopia, Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia, a systemic review conducted in Ethiopia on the general population, and Harari Regional state, East Ethiopia [11, 19, 21, 28].

This is in line with other research findings conducted in Wolaita, Southern Ethiopia, Which reports Women who refuse sex in some situations were at a significant risk of being abused by their partner [21]. It may be due to the custom which can teach the women that violence is acceptable. Besides, women who believe that women deserve abuse in certain circumstances may be less likely to challenge male authority and therefore be learn to live with the abuse. However, the lack of sexual autonomy expressed by many women has substantial implications for women in the era of HIV/AIDS [6]."

The Coincidence of physical and psychological violence was the most reported feature among the overlaps of IPV.\nWomen\u2019s inter-parental witness of violence, poor adherence to ART drug, non-disclosure of the result to Partner, controlling behavior, and favorable attitude toward wife-beating were factors associated with IPV. Therefore, integrating intimate partner violence victim screening with ART services, empowering HIV-positive women, and increasing their awareness of sexual and reproductive rights are needed. Furthermore, policy priority should involve intimate partner violence legal policy; involve males, and transform the culture of gender norms.\nAbbreviations AIDS Accrued Immune Deficiency Syndrome ART Anti Retroviral Therapy CEDAW Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women CI Confidence Interval EDHS Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey GBV Gender-Based Violence IPV Intimate partner violence OR Odds Ratio OI Opportunistic infection SPSS Statistical package for social sciences\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to thank Wollega University Institute of Health Sciences for their approval of this study.
