We present here a critical step towards realizing ST-SPPs by reporting observations of ultrabroadband striped ST-SPPs. These are SPPs in which each wavelength travels at a prescribed angle with respect to the propagation axis to produce a periodic (striped) transverse spatial profile that is diffraction-free. We start with a free-space ST wave packet that is coupled to a ST-SPP at a gold-dielectric interface, and unambiguously identify the ST-SPP via an axial beating detected in two-photon fluorescence produced by the superposition of incident ST wave packet and the excited surface-bound ST-SPP. These results highlight a viable approach for efficient and reliable coupling to ST-SPPs, and thus represent the first crucial step towards realization of the full potential of ST-SPPs for plasmonic sensing and imaging.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe strong localization of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at metal-dielectric interfaces has enabled a broad swath of applications in sensing [1, 2], superresolution imaging [3\u20136], optical tweezers [7\u20139], and information processing [10\u201313]. However, in absence of a transverse confining structure [14\u201316], SPPs diffract in the transverse dimension just as free optical fields do in the bulk. Furthermore, because SPPs have only one free transverse dimension, the so-called \u2018diffraction-free\u2019 beam structures that have proved useful in free space [17] (e.g., Bessel [18] and Matthieu [19] beams) are not a viable option. These monochromatic beams require two transverse dimensions to resist diffraction; e.g., in contrast to its twodimensional (2D) counterpart, the one-dimensional (1D) Bessel beam diffracts. Indeed, the only diffraction-free monochromatic optical fields in 1D are cosine and Airy waves [20] \u2013 both of which have been exploited to produce monochromatic SPPs (cosine-Gauss SPPs [21] and Airy plasmons [22\u201325]).\nRecently a new class of propagation-invariant pulsed beams (diffraction-free and dispersion-free) have been investigated under the general rubric of \u2018space-time\u2019 (ST) wave packets, which require introducing a tight spectral association between the wavelengths and the spatial frequencies that conforms to a prescribed functional form\n\u2217 raddy@creol.ucf.edu \u2020 kubo.atsushi.ka@u.tsukuba.ac.jp\n[26\u201333]. Besides propagation invariance in free space [34\u2013 36], as well as in non-dispersive [37] or dispersive [38\u2013 43] dielectrics, ST wave packets feature a host of unique characteristics [32, 33], including tunable group velocities [44, 45] and anomalous refraction [46, 47]. A critical feature of ST wave packets makes them particularly useful candidates for SPPs: their diffraction-free behavior is independent of dimensionality [33] (whether one [28] or two [48, 49] transverse spatial coordinates are involved), making them excellent candidates for plasmonic applications that require maintaining transverse spatial localization in sensing and imaging.\nWe recently investigated the propagation characteristics of pulsed SPPs having a finite transverse extent in the generic setting of a metal-dielectric interface [50]. By structuring the spatio-temporal spectra of these surface waves in a similar manner to ST wave packets, we verified theoretically that they are localized in all dimensions (the in-plane dimensions, in addition to the out-of-plane plasmonic confinement), are propagation invariant (the transverse profile resists diffraction, and the pulse profile resists dispersion independently of the materials selected), and their group velocity can be tuned from subluminal to superluminal values [50]. We have thus dubbed these surface-bound wave packets ST-SPPs [Fig. 1(a,b)]. However, ST-SPPs have not been realized experimentally to date. Indeed, the question regarding the optimal strategy for launching ST-SPPs at a metal-dielectric interface from a free-space ST wave packet without modifying its spatio-temporal spectral structure remains an open question. Whereas conventional approaches such ar X iv :2\n20 2.\n10 50\n4v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. op\ntic s]\n2 1\nFe b\n20 22\n2\nas grating couplers succeeded in launching cosine and Airy plasmons in the monochromatic regime, they are not appropriate for ST-SPPs \u2013 because they can alter the spectral structure of the incident field that is key to the unique propagation characteristics of ST-SPPs. Furthermore, care must be taken to clearly ascertain that a surface-bound wave has been excited with the targeted characteristics, and to distinguish it from the incident free-space ST wave packet.\nHere we take the first crucial step towards realizing ST-SPPs by launching a space-time-coupled ultrabroadband pulsed laser beam into a SPP at a gold-dielectric interface via a nano-scale slit [51\u201353]. The pulsed laser has a FWHM-bandwidth of \u2206\u03bb = 110 nm (10-fs pulse duration) at a center wavelength of \u03bbo = 800 nm. By directing each wavelength in free space at a different angle with respect to a fixed propagation axis, we incorporate angular dispersion [54] into the field to hold the spatial frequency fixed across the entire bandwidth. This free-space optical field is then coupled to a surface-bound wave via a 100-nm-wide nano-slit that is ion-milled into the gold (Au). This particular excitation mechanism preserves the transverse spatial frequency of the incident field in the coupled SPP. Because a fixed spatial frequency is maintained in the incident optical field, this approach produces a \u2018striped\u2019 ST-SPP having a periodic transverse profile, whose period is tuned from 10 \u00b5m to 30 \u00b5m [Fig. 1(c)]. The striped ST-SPP excited on the Au surface is microscopically detected by imaging the\ntwo-photon florescence emitted from a 25-nm-thick dyedoped polymer layer coating the Au surface, which reveals distinctive beat patterns along both the transverse and the axial directions \u2013 each of which is modulated with an individual periodicity. Along the transverse direction, the fluorescence image shows a periodicity equal to a half of that of a strived ST-SPP, reflecting two antinodes incorporated in one cycle of the transverse profile. The axial beating is the result of interference between the free-space ST wave packet and the surface-bound striped ST-SPP [55, 56]. These observations provide evidence for the feasibility of synthesizing arbitrary ST-SPPs that incorporate a multiplicity of spatial frequencies [50]."

In free space, if we retain one transverse coordinate x (in anticipation of the formulation of STSPPs) along with the axial coordinate z, the dispersion relationship k2x + k 2 z =( \u03c9 c )\n2 defines the light-cone surface [Fig. 2(a)]; here kx and kz are the transverse and axial wave numbers along x and z, respectively, \u03c9 is the temporal frequency, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. The spectral support domain for a conventional pulsed beam \u2013 in which the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are separable \u2013 takes the form of a 2D region [Fig. 2(a)], indicating finite spatial and temporal bandwidths [58].\nIn contrast, the spectral support domain for a ST wave packet in free space \u2013 while featuring finite spatial and temporal bandwidths \u2013 is the 1D trajectory at the intersection of the light-cone with a tilted spectral plane [28]. This spectral trajectory determines the relationship between the spatial and temporal frequencies of the plane waves undergirding the field structure [33, 57]. The spectral plane is parallel to the kx-axis [Fig. 2(b)], and is defined as kz = ko + \u2126/v\u0303, where \u2126 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9o, \u03c9o is a fixed temporal frequency, ko = \u03c9o c is the associated wave number, and v\u0303 is the group velocity of the ST wave packet, which can in principle take on arbitrary values [31, 37, 44, 45]. Such a wave packet travels rigidly in free space at a group velocity v\u0303 [28, 34, 59]. Because each spatial frequency kx is associated with a single temporal frequency \u03c9, the spatial and temporal bandwidths, \u2206kx and \u2206\u03c9, respectively, are related [28, 59]: \u2206\u03c9\u03c9o =( \u2206kx ko )2 12|1\u2212n\u0303| , where n\u0303 = c/v\u0303 is the group index of the free-space ST wave packet. We can then write kx(\u03c9) = \u03c9 c sin {\u03d5(\u03c9)} and kz(\u03c9) = \u03c9 c cos {\u03d5(\u03c9)}, where \u03d5(\u03c9) is the propagation angle of the single frequency component \u03c9 with the\nz-axis, and sin{\u03d5(\u03c9)}=\u00b1 \u221a\n2(1\u2212 n\u0303) \u2126\u03c9o + (1\u2212 n\u0303 2)( \u2126\u03c9o ) 2;\nwhere \u2126>0 when n\u0303<1 (\u03c9> \u03c9o for superluminal ST wave packets), and \u2126<0 when n\u0303>1 (\u03c9<\u03c9o for subluminal ST\n3\nfree-space light-cone k2x + k 2 z =( \u03c9 c ) 2.

Note that \u03d5(\u03c9) is non-differentiable in the vicinity of \u03c9 = \u03c9o (\u2126 = 0), which is crucial for tuning the group velocity and maintaining propagation invariance [60\u201362]."

            "text": "In contrast to the free-space light-cone k2x + k 2 z =( \u03c9 c ) 2, the light-cone for SPPs at the interface between a metal and a dielectric having relative permittivities m(\u03c9) and\nd(\u03c9), respectively, is given by k 2 x+k 2 z =( \u03c9 c ) 2 m(\u03c9) d(\u03c9) m(\u03c9)+ d(\u03c9) . This SPP dispersion relation is enforced by localization along y with wave number ky,d = \u03c9 c\nd(\u03c9)\u221a d(\u03c9)+ m(\u03c9) in\nthe dielectric and ky,m = \u03c9 c m(\u03c9)\u221a d(\u03c9)+ m(\u03c9) in the metal, both of which take on imaginary values. We employ the Lorentz-Drude model [63] for m(\u03c9) that combines the intraband contribution (the free-electron effects described by the Drude model) and the interband contribution (the bound-electron effects described by the Lorentz model for insulators). The SPP light-cone takes the form k2x + k 2 z = k 2 LD(\u03c9), where kLD represents the real part of the SPP dispersion relation or light-line according to the dielectric functions of the materials described above. A pulsed SPP of finite transverse width corresponds to a 2D spectral support domain on the surface of the SPP light-cone [Fig. 2(c)]. We define a ST-SPP [50] as that surface-bound wave packet whose spectral support domain is the 1D trajectory at the intersection of the SPP\nlight-cone with a spectral plane kz=k \u2032 o +\u2126/v\u0303 [Fig. 2(d)]; where v\u0303 is its group velocity, and k\u2032o 6=ko is the SPP wave number on the SPP light-line (kx = 0 in the SPP lightcone) evaluated at \u03c9o. Such a ST-SPP travels rigidly along the metal-dielectric interface without diffraction or dispersion \u2013 independently of the material parameters \u2013 at a group velocity v\u0303 that can in principle take on arbitrary values [50].\nIn our initial experiments reported here, we have made use of ultrabroadband pulses of bandwidth \u2206\u03bb=110 nm (FWHM) at a center wavelength of \u03bbo = 800 nm. Because the spatial and temporal bandwidths of a ST-SPP are related to each other, just as in the case of free-space ST wave packets, the large \u2206\u03bb employed necessitates an extremely large \u2206kx, thereby requiring operation deep within the non-paraxial regime. To avoid such an exorbitant requirement at this early stage of development of ST-SPPs, we instead consider a spectral support domain in which |kx|= 2\u03c0\u03bbx is held constant [Fig. 3(a)], where \u03bbx is a transverse length scale. Therefore, sin{\u03d5(\u03c9)}= 2\u03c0c\u03bbx\u03c9 , so that \u03d5(\u03bb)\u2248 \u03bb\u03bbx in the small-angle approximation. By maintaining the linear proportionality between \u03d5 and \u03bb, we can exploit the full bandwidth of \u2206\u03bb\u223c110 nm within the paraxial domain (\u03d5<5\u25e6). The fixed kx entails a periodic transverse spatial profile for the ST-SPP of period \u03bbx. Note that \u03bbx is not the laser wavelength, but is instead a transverse spatial period characterizing the field structure. We thus call this structured surface wave a striped ST-SPP.\nThe spectral support domain of this striped ST-SPP [Fig. 3(a)] is the intersection of the SPP light-cone with the iso-|kx| planes. The spectral projection onto the (kx, \u03c9 c )-plane takes the form of two vertical lines kx = \u00b1 2\u03c0\u03bbx [Fig. 3(b)], and that onto the (kz, \u03c9 c )-plane takes the form of a curve that is close to the SPP light-line [Fig. 3(c)]. To delineate the SPP light-line from the striped-ST-SPP dispersion curve, we re-plot in Fig. 3(d) the spectral projection from Fig. 3(c) after transforming the horizontal axis kz \u2192 kz \u2212 k\u2032o \u2212 \u2126v\u0303SPP , where v\u0303SPP is the group velocity of the SPP evaluated at \u03c9o (the slope of the SPP light-line at \u03c9o). The SPP light-line in this case becomes a vertical line at kz \u2212 k\u2032o \u2212 \u2126v\u0303SPP = 0, and the spectral projection for the striped ST-SPP is wellseparated from it [Fig. 3(d)]. This is the spatio-temporal spectral structure that must be inculcated into the SPP to yield a diffraction-free striped ST-SPP."

The mutual coherence between the free ST wave packet and the surface-bound SPP leads to an interference pattern with an axial beat length along the z-axis given by\n\u03bbbeat = 2\u03c0\n|kSPP \u2212 ko sin\u03b1| , (1)\nFIG. 5: Experimental arrangement for launching striped ST-SPPs from free-space ST wave packets. (a) Schematic of the entire arrangement, including synthesis of free-space ST wave packets, excitation of striped ST-SPPs, and detection. The SLM used in the experiment was in reflection mode, but we depict an unfolded configuration for clarity. (b) The deflection angle \u00b1\u03d5(\u03bb) imparted by the SLM to each incident wavelength \u03bb to yield a striped ST-SPP of spatial period \u03bbx extending from 10 \u00b5m to 30 \u00b5m. (c) SLM phase pattern used to produce the ST wave packet in\nfree space (for \u03bbx=30 \u00b5m). (d,e) Schematic of the sample geometry (gold film on a Si substrate) including the nano-slit structure. The Au surface is covered with a 25-nm-thick dye-doped PMMA film. The plane of the incident ST wave packet is inclined by an angle \u03b1=50\u25e6\nwith respect to the surface normal, and is parallel to the nano-slit.\nwhere kSPP = kz(\u03c9o, kx) \u2248 k\u2032o is the SPP wave number, and ko sin\u03b1 is the in-plane wave number of the incident field. We detect the time-averaged two-photon fluorescence signal I(x, z) that retains this beat length, where:\nI(x, z) \u221d \u222b dt ( |ESPP(x, z; t) + Efree(x, z; t)|2 )2 ; (2)\nhere, ESPP and Efree are the scalar representations of the excited SPP and the free-space electric fields in the PMMA film, respectively. Typically, the out-ofplane component dominates the field intensity. The two-photon-fluorescence emission is collected with an objective lens (M Plan Apo SL20X, Mitutoyo) equipped with a band-pass filter transmitting light in the range\n6\n475 \u2212 495 nm (Semrock, FT-02-485/20-25), followed by a CCD camera (Rolera EM-C2, QImaging) [55, 56]. The intensity I(x, z) detected by the CCD camera is a time integral of the fourth power of the total electric field.\nFigure 6(a) shows an optical micrograph of the twophoton-fluorescence signal for a conventional pulsed SPP (after setting the SLM phase to 0). As shown in Fig. 5(d,e), the plane of the incident field is tilted with respect to the normal to the sample. The incident field launches SPPs from the nano-slit located at z \u2248 0 in the forward (to the right in Fig. 6(a), z > 0) and backward (to the left in Fig. 6(a), z < 0) directions. The backward-coupled SPP is weaker, and the associated axial beating length is \u03bbbeat\u22480.5 \u00b5m (according to Eq. 1), which is finer than the spatial resolution of our imaging system. The forward-coupled SPP has \u03bbbeat \u2248 2.8 \u00b5m. In our measurements of striped ST-SPPs, we focus exclusively on the forward-coupled SPP propagating to the right z>0 in Fig. 6(a).\nThe overall spatial distribution of the two-photonfluorescence emission is impacted by the shape of the excitation-laser spot on the sample surface. In Fig. 6(a), the fluorescence intensity has its maximum at z\u224830 \u00b5m because the center of the laser spot is located there. Nevertheless, in the vicinity of z = 0, the visibility of the interference pattern is large, indicating comparable contributions from ESPP and Efree in Eq. 2. This is because the signal is obtained from the 25-nm-thick PMMA film, and the intensity of the surface bound SPP is very high due to field localization at the Au surface.\nWe plot in Fig. 6(b) a calculated spatial profile in the (x, z)-plane of the expected two-photon-fluorescence intensity distribution resulting from the interference of an incident free-space field and the excited SPP. We make use of Eq. 2 and assume a plane-wave pulsed incident field. The calculation is repeated for the forward- and\nbackward-coupled SPPs, which are characterized by different axial beat lengths \u03bbbeat. The calculated intensity profile [Fig. 6(b)] is in excellent agreement with the measured distribution [Fig. 6(a)]."

            "text": "We now excite the sample with the ST wave packet having constant |kx|. Figure 7(a) is an optical micrograph of the two-photon fluorescence obtained with an incident ST wave packet with \u03bbx = 10 \u00b5m. A magnified view in Fig. 7(b) shows the axial beat pattern excited after the nano-slit (located at z\u22480) couples the incident field to a forward-coupled surface-bound wave packet propagating to the right z>0). Here, in addition to the axial beating observed for the pulsed SPP in Fig. 6(a), we observe an additional field structure: a transverse periodic spatial structure with period \u03bbx/2 = 5 \u00b5m. The halving of the transverse period in the micrograph compared to \u03bbx simply reflects the structure of the ST-SPP field containing two phase-inverted antinodes within one transverse cycle. The measured axial beating length is \u03bbbeat \u2248 2.9 \u00b5m. Figure 7(c) shows the calculated intensity profile for the two-photon fluorescence signal resulting from the interference of the striped ST-SPP with the incident ST wave packet. The calculation is performed for both the forward- and backward-coupled striped STSPPs using the same approach employed in Fig. 6(b).\nBy simply modifying the 2D phase distribution imparted by the SLM to the spectrally resolved wave front of the free-space pulse [Fig. 5(c)], we can tune the proportionality between \u03d5 and \u03bb [Fig. 5(b)], thus producing a different value for kx. Once this new ST wave packet is coupled to a SPP via the nano-slit, a striped ST-SPP is formed having a new transverse period \u03bbx. We plot in\n7\nFig. 8 measurements of four such striped ST-SPPs with \u03bbx increased in 5-\u00b5m steps from \u03bbx = 15 \u00b5m [Fig. 8(a)] to \u03bbx=30 \u00b5m [Fig. 8(d)]. The axial beat length changes only slightly with the tuning of kx: it is largest for the smallest kx (or largest \u03bbx).\nAn important observation can be made based on Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 8(a-d). The measured transverse period \u03bbx in each of these (from \u03bbx = 10 \u00b5m to 30 \u00b5m) matches that expected from the exited value of kx, and no extra transverse beating is observed over the observation area on the Au surface. The absence of addition transverse beating indicates that the transverse period of the ST-SPP matches that of the incident ST wave packet. Therefore, by combining a multiplicity of spatial frequencies kx in the incident ST wave packet to produce a localized peak along x, a corresponding ST-SPP similarly localized along x \u2013 and that is, furthermore, diffraction-free \u2013 is to be expected.\n(b) 20 \u00b5m, (c) 25 \u00b5m, and (d) 30 \u00b5m. The red arrow on the top of each panel identifies the location of the nano-slit at z\u22480. The axial beat length \u03bbx is approximately constant. The yellow curves on the right of each panel is the transverse intensity profile resulting\nfrom integration along z."

            "heading": "IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION",
            "text": "The results reported here emphasize the possibilities emerging from interfacing the rapidly developing topic of ST wave packets [33] with nanophotonics. Recent efforts along these lines include exploiting nanophotonic structures for synthesizing ST wave packets [65], in addition to the propagation of ST wave packets in waveguides [66\u2013 71].\nAlthough we have produced here a particular example of a ST-SPP (namely, a striped ST-SPP), the experimental arrangement we have constructed is capable of synthesizing a variety of other ST-SPPs (such as those in Ref. [50]) by changing the SLM phase pattern employed [Fig. 5(a,c)], which will be the focus of our future efforts. The bandwidth exploited here \u2206\u03bb=110 nm is the largest for a ST wave packet to date, exceeding the previous record [72] of \u2206\u03bb=30 nm. Moreover, to retain this large bandwidth while localizing the ST-SPP along x in the paraxial regime, we can exploit the recently demonstrated strategy of \u2018spectral recycling\u2019 [73]. Finally, our current detection scheme unveils the time-averaged intensity profile of the ST-SPP. Reconstructing the unique Xshaped spatio-temporal profiles of ST-SPPs [Fig. 1(a,b)] requires time-resolved measurements, which we are cur-\n8 rently constructing. Furthermore, such a time-resolved detection scheme is required to measure the group velocity of the ST-SPP on the Au surface, which is predicted to be tunable over a wide span of values [50].\nAn intriguing possibility emerges from our recent experimental demonstration of accelerating ST wave packets in free space with record-high magnitudes of acceleration [74] (\u223c4\u22125 orders-of-magnitudes larger than previous reports [75\u201377]), in addition to arbitrary acceleration profiles along the propagation axis [78]. These advances suggest the intriguing potential for exciting accelerating ST-SPPs, which may lead to new forms of radiation produced from the accelerated surface plasmons [79].\nBecause the axial wave number kz of the excited striped ST-SPP is not linear in \u2126 (because kx is constant), striped ST-SPPs are dispersive. Indeed, they correspond to the wave packets in [80\u201383] known as pulsed Bessel beams in which a fixed radial wave number kr is maintained constant, resulting in a diffraction-free Bessel beam structure as the transverse spatial profile, but a temporally dispersive pulse structure. Because SPPs are surface waves that have only one transverse dimension, the Bessel profile degenerates into a cosine profile.\nIn conclusion, we have provided the first experimental evidence for ST-SPPs and the possibility of efficiently exciting them at a gold-dielectric interface. Starting with a 16-fs pulse at a wavelength of 800 nm, we form a ST wave packet in free space that retains the full pulse bandwidth (FWHM \u2206\u03bb=110 nm) and couple it to a SPP via a 100-nm-wide nano-slit milled into the Au surface. As a first step, we have made use of a ST wave packet in\nwhich a single spatial frequency kx= 2\u03c0 \u03bbx\nis exploited (the propagation angle of each frequency with respect to a common direction is linear in frequency). This free-space wave packet is coupled by a nano-slit to a propagationinvariant ST-SPP whose transverse spatial profile is periodically modulated (or striped) with a period \u03bbx. We have produced and observed striped ST-SPPs with \u03bbx in the range from 10 \u00b5m to 30 \u00b5m by changing the 2D phase pattern imparted by a SLM to the spatially resolved spectrum of the initial generic laser pulse in free space. Future work will incorporate a continuous spatial spectrum rather than a single spatial frequency, which yields a localized rather than periodic spatial profile; time-resolved measurements to verify the propagation invariance of the spatio-temporal profile for the ST-SPP; and tuning of the group velocity of the excited surface plasmon."
