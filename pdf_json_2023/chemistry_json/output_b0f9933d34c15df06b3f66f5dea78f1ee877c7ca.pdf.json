            "text": "The fungal strain SAL12 was isolated from leaves of mangrove plant Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. collected in Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve in south China\u2019s Hainan Province. The genomic DNA of this fungus was extracted, PCR amplified and sequenced. This strain was identified as Aspergillus fumigatus by BLAST search of the 18S rRNA sequence. A voucher specimen was deposited at China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) with the number of CGMCC No.40321. The Aspergillus fumigatus SAL12 strain was grown on PDA medium (20g of glucose, 20 g of agar, and 2 g of sea salt in 1 L of potato infusion). Plugs of agar supporting mycelial growth were cut and transferred aseptically to 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL of GYP medium (10 g of glucose, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of peptone, 2 g of sea salt in 1 L of dd H2O). The flasks were incubated at 28 \u00b0C on a rotary shaker at a speed of 120 rpm for three days as seed culture. 4.5 mL of seed culture was aseptically transferred to a 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing autoclaved rice medium (80 g of rice, 0.32 g of sea salt, and 160 mL of tap water). 150 flasks were used in this work. The flasks were incubated statically at 26 \u00b0C for 35 days. The cultured\nS4\nmedium (55 L) was extracted with equal volume of methanol three times, and then the solvent was evaporated to yield 10 L extract. The extract was partitioned with equal volume of EtOAc three times, and then samples were evaporated to give 265 g of organic extract.\nThe organic extract was subjected to silica gel CC using gradient elution with a petroleum ether/EtOAc mixture (100:0, 80:20, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70, 20:80, 0:100, v/v) and EtOAc/MeOH mixture (80:20, 50:50, 20:80, 0:100, v/v) to give 11 fractions (Fr.A1-Fr.A11). Fr.A8 was subjected to silica gel CC eluted with CH2Cl2/MeOH mixtures (99/1, 97:3, 95:5, 93:7, 90:10, 80:20, 0:100, v/v) to afford fractions B1\u2013B7. Fraction B6 was purified by a semi-preparative HPLC instrument equipped with a DAD detection and monitored between 210-500 nm, using an Ultimate XB-C18 column (10 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm) eluted with a linear gradient from 10% CH3CN to 40% CH3CN (CH3CN-H2O system) over the course of 0\u201340 min at a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min to obtain compounds 1 (tR 27.3 min, 15 mg) and 3 (tR 24.1 min, 8 mg). Fraction B5 was isolated by the semi-preparative HPLC eluted with a linear gradient from 20% CH3CN to 45% CH3CN over the course of 0\u201330 min at a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min to obtain compound 2 (tR 29.8 min, 15 mg). Fraction B3 was purified by the semi-preparative HPLC eluted a linear gradient from 35% CH3CN to 75% CH3CN over the course of 0\u2013 40 min at the same flow rate to give compound 4 (tR 32.1 min, 27 mg)."

Briefly, the bacteria were cultivated in Mueller-Hinton (M-H) broth, and then the culture broth was transferred into a 96-well plate. The DMSO solutions of 1\u20134 were serially diluted by M-H broth and added into each well in the plates. The plates were placed in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h. The absorbance was\nS5\nread at 630 nm using a microplate reader. Vacaomycin and amoxicillin were used as positive controls. DMSO and M-H broth were used as negative and blank controls respectively.
