1. **Investigate the long-term effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on the liver and lungs.** The current study only examined the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure for two months. It is possible that longer exposure durations could lead to more severe effects on the liver and lungs. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of this type of exposure to determine if it can cause clinical and functional manifestations.


2. **Examine the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on other organs and tissues.** The current study only examined the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on the major organs of Sprague Dawley rats. It is possible that this type of exposure could also affect other organs and tissues. Future studies should investigate the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on a wider range of organs and tissues to determine if it can cause any adverse effects.


3. **Investigate the mechanisms by which 150 kHz IF EMR exposure causes liver and lung inflammation.** The current study did not investigate the mechanisms by which 150 kHz IF EMR exposure causes liver and lung inflammation. Future studies should investigate these mechanisms to better understand the effects of this type of exposure and to develop strategies to prevent or mitigate these effects.


4. **Determine the exposure threshold for 150 kHz IF EMR.** The current study did not identify an exposure threshold for 150 kHz IF EMR. Future studies should investigate the exposure threshold for this type of exposure to determine the level at which it begins to cause adverse effects. This information is important for developing safety guidelines for exposure to 150 kHz IF EMR.


5. **Investigate the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on other animal models.** The current study only examined the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on Sprague Dawley rats. It is possible that this type of exposure could have different effects on other animal models. Future studies should investigate the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on other animal models to determine if it can cause any adverse effects.
