            "text": "Worldwide, an estimated 10 million people are newly diagnosed with dementia per year and this is projected to increase from 82 million in 2030 to 152 million in 2050.1 Adding to this burden, the global ageing population will increase the need for health care provided by qualified professionals.1 While dementia is not a normal part of ageing, it does mainly affect older people and is a universal health- care challenge in the 21st century, with an increasing emphasis placed on dementia prevention.\nStudies of dementia knowledge in health- care trainees highlight variations in the level of understanding across countries and disciplines. Liddle et al3 found that dementia knowledge was found to vary among students enrolled in different Australian health- related programs. Poor dementia knowledge was found in health- care undergraduates in Hong Kong4 where, for example, very little was known about dementia treatment or the fact that dementia medication does not necessarily prevent further decline. In contrast, Scerri and Scerri5 found that Maltese nursing students had adequate knowledge of dementia. The mixed outcomes from these studies highlight the need for further investigations into health- care students' knowledge of dementia. There is also evidence to suggest that current practicing health- care professionals also possess inconsistent levels of dementia knowledge, which is why addressing the deficit during their education is essential.6\nEvidence- based knowledge suggests that prevention, early intervention and modification of risk factors for dementia have the potential to significantly reduce future dementia burden.2 Dementia onset could be prevented or delayed by behavioural interventions such as aerobic exercise, social activities, reduced tobacco smoking, management of chronic disease (e.g. diabetes and hypertension), obesity, low mood and hearing loss. Nevertheless, knowledge of dementia prevention and modifiable risk factors is still emerging in the research literature and, according to Livingston et al,2 should be an area of focus for research and health service\nintegration. Implementation of evidence- based strategies to lower future rates of dementia is dependent upon knowledge and delivery of this information by healthcare professionals.\nHealth literacy is a set of cognitive and social skills that enable a person to access, process and understand appropriate and effective health information and services.7 Health literacy can reduce the burden for informal carers of people with dementia,8 but little is known about the relationship between health literacy and dementia knowledge in health- care trainees and professionals. Furthermore, higher health literacy levels during undergraduate study are found to be correlated with a more competent healthcare workforce.9 It is suggested that health- care professionals who possess high levels of health literacy are able to effectively communicate with patients, improve their patients' health literacy and support them in making appropriate health- care decisions.10 Coleman's11 literature\nK E Y W O R D S\ndementia, health communication, health education, health literacy, health services, information literacy\nPolicy Impact This study builds knowledge regarding future health professionals' health literacy, dementia knowledge and preferences for digital interventions. It highlights the need to increase dementia prevention, care and intervention content in health- care curricula at a tertiary level. The study informs policy that supports strategies to guide curriculum reform in dementia responsiveness.\nPractice Impact This study highlighted gaps in future health professionals' knowledge. It shows cause for practicing clinicians to reflect upon, and potentially improve, their own dementia knowledge and awareness of effective digital health tools that can be offered to people with dementia and their carers.\nCorrespondence Helen M.

Coleman11 asserts the importance of health literacy in \u2018every clinical encounter and every public health communication\u2019 [p.70]. Effective clinician\u2013 patient communication is emphasised as an important component of health literacy. Research showing the potential clinical impact of clinician communication10 and health literacy is only starting to emerge and needs further attention.11\nExamination of health literacy in undergraduate health students has shown considerable variation. Training in health literacy principles in curricula for health- care undergraduates is lacking, with varying levels of health literacy reported for students enrolled in health- related programs across the world.11 For instance, a study of senior nursing students across eight state universities in Louisiana, USA, found that while senior nursing students enter the workforce with some health literacy knowledge and experience, gaps exist in their knowledge. The study underscores the need for further training to address these gaps so that nurses can graduate with knowledge of the importance of health literacy and skills to assess and enhance patient understanding.12 Another study in China also revealed that the nursing students' health literacy levels were insufficient.13 Studies conducted in Denmark14 found that the health literacy levels of students are largely dependent on other factors such as personal background, educational path, economic factors and health behaviours and risks.\nTraining in health literacy at an undergraduate level not only increases the health literacy of students but is also associated with positive educational outcomes,11 which, in turn, potentially improve future clinical care outcomes.10 Presently, health professionals are a key point of contact for the general population, contributing to health information for diseases like dementia and providing advice to patients on modifiable risk factors. As such, health and social professionals play an integral role in patient education on dementia and modifiable risk factors.\nA key factor in an individual's health literacy is the ability to find good health information.15 This study seeks to understand the students' preferences for digital modalities to receive health information. Finally, with the rapidly digitalised health environment and development of digital health interventions that focus on dementia prevention and risk reduction,16\u2013 18 it is imperative that health professionals are open to using and recommending effective evidence- based digital health interventions that may reduce dementia risk and prevent dementia. Yet research indicates that it is health professionals, rather than consumers, who are resistant to using digital health.19 While the final objective may be to promote acceptance of digital health interventions and educate health professionals\nregarding their efficacy,20 it is first important to explore perceptions of digital health utility and, specifically, which modalities may be seen as the most useful.\nThe aim of this study was to (a) assess knowledge of dementia (including risk factors and prevention strategies) and health literacy among a sample of Australian healthcare students; (b) identify modality preferences of digital health interventions addressing dementia prevention, as a measure of the population's likelihood to recommend digital interventions to future patients; and (c) explore potential relationships among health literacy, dementia knowledge, dementia prevention knowledge and a student's preferences for different digital health modalities. It is expected that an understanding of health students' dementia knowledge and health literacy will contribute to the emerging literature in this area and inform the development of relevant curricula."

            "text": "Demographic information (e.g. age, gender and healthcare program of study), participants' dementia knowledge and health literacy were assessed using the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS)21 and All Aspects of Health Literacy Scale (AAHLS)22 respectively. The DKAS21,23 is a 25- item survey developed and validated in Australia, to measure people's knowledge of dementia. It has had some validation internationally21,24 and in a range of populations and studies.25 The tool includes a series of 25 statements about dementia with four main constructs pertaining to dementia: causes and characteristics; communication and behaviour; care considerations as well as risk factors and health promotion.21,23 Respondents must select from \u2018Probably True\u00a0=\u00a0 0\u2019; \u2018Probably False\u00a0=\u00a0 1\u2019 and \u2018False\u00a0=\u00a02\u2019. A higher DKAS total score (of 50) is indicative of higher dementia knowledge. Previous research shows the subscales have acceptable internal consistency (\u03b1 \u2265 0.65), the overall scale has good reliability (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.85) and validity21,23 and is one of the scales to assess people's knowledge regarding dementia prevention. The current research showed a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85 for the overall scale.\nThe AAHLS22 is a 14- item validated questionnaire covering three subscales that measure functional, communicative and critical health literacy. The tool draws on foundational health literacy work by Nutbeam7 to ensure a range of literacy skills are tested. Respondents are required to select from three options \u2018Rarely, Sometimes or Never\u2019 for 12 of the questions, with scores weighted from 1 to 3 points, depending on the positive or negative intent of the question.22,26 As recommended by Chinn and McCarthy,22 Items 1 and 2 were aggregated to form a new score indicating functional health literacy and ability to access support. Two items are \u2018Yes/No\u2019 answers with scores weighted at 1 or\u00a03. Higher total AAHLS scores (of 39 possible points)\nindicate a higher level of health literacy. The AAHLS instrument has been previously reported as having adequate reliability (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.74),22 similar to the current study (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.63).\nAs research continues to evolve regarding dementia prevention and risk, there is no questionnaire to measure health professionals' perceptions of what may be effective in preventing and reducing the risk of dementia. In the absence of such a measure, the authors with expertise in dementia research developed a scale drawing upon current dementia literature. Perceived effectiveness of strategies for dementia prevention (i.e. dementia prevention strategies: DPS) was measured using items developed by the investigators with categorical responses of \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018maybe\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019. The scoring for the DPS is attached in Appendix\u00a0S1. Scoring was dependent on current research evidence. A score of 2 was given for a correct answer, 0 for an incorrect answer (i.e. no evidence to support the prevention/risk reduction strategy) and 1 for an answer where there is mixed research evidence. The DPS was found to have adequate internal reliability (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.62).\nSimilarly, as this is a relatively unexplored area of research, no measure exists that assesses the perceived usefulness of different digital modalities for dementia prevention and risk reduction. As such, the authors who have expertise in digital health and dementia met to discuss the modalities that currently exist for dementia risk reduction and symptom management. After further review of the current grey- and- white literature on dementia digital health measures, the authors developed a scale examining the perceived usefulness of different digital health modalities for dementia prevention/risk reduction for oneself and one's client/patient. The measure contained items such as \u2018If a program was developed to help people to reduce their risk of getting dementia or delay the onset of dementia, which (if any) of the following modalities do you think would be useful for a client?\u2019 Participants were asked about the utility of seven modalities including text messages, mobile applications (apps), online programs, emails, messaging (e.g. Messenger\u2122), social media or others, wherein participants could add free text comments. See Appendix\u00a0S2 for this scale. The possible responses (\u2018yes\u2019, \u2018maybe\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019) were analysed as a categorical variable. The online survey was first pilot tested with a convenience sample of four students known to the research team, to assess the time to complete the survey, interest and any difficult questions. Problematic questions were reworded for clarity."

This workforce needs to be able to draw upon evidence- based information to effectively support people to prevent dementia through a range of health behaviours. Digital health interventions can be an effective way to support people with dementia and their carers,26,29 and increase support to people in risk reduction and dementia prevention activities. Research that focuses on the role of digital health in supporting people to reduce their risk of dementia is rapidly emerging.16,17 As such, there is also a need for health professionals to be knowledgeable and capable of recommending digital health interventions where appropriate.27,28\nStudents from health- related programs who participated in the current study had relatively high levels of health literacy but an average knowledge of dementia. That is, students who completed the AAHLS (n\u00a0=\u00a0609) appeared to have moderately high health literacy scores, with a mean of 30.9 of a possible 39.

The mean DKAS22 score was 27.4, indicating average dementia knowledge (of a possible total of 50). As dementia is growing in prevalence in the population, ensuring future health- care professionals have adequate knowledge of the disease, its progression and effects on the person with dementia, and their families, are of key importance. A recent study to identify core competencies for multidisciplinary health and aged care workers assumes that workers would be familiar with common conditions such as dementia.28\nA growing reliance on digital health presents a future workforce need that demands a greater understanding of which digital technologies can be used to support a range of outcomes for dementia care. The current study found that there was a preference for mobile apps and online programs. It is possible that this result is, in part, due to young people's familiarity with this type of digital technology. Participants may have had more familiarity with mobile phone apps aimed at increasing cognitive health. There is a large expanding market for brain health apps,29 with one estimate projecting a $US6 billion spend in 2020 as the market for brain health apps has become \u2018mainstream\u2019.30 Indeed, the successful marketing and expansion of brain health apps have been the subject of controversy, with a written submission from 70 international scientists demanding a better evidence base before allowing marketing claims that expose so many digital consumers to these apps.31,32 Consumers and health professionals seeking quality dementia content and caregiving advice face a complex, commercially driven marketplace with a lack of quality standards.33 Multiple marketing strategies increase people's exposure to brain health apps more so than other apps and, at times, companies have been fined for misleading claims regarding the benefits of these apps.34 Considering the successful marketing of such apps, in conjunction with only 7% of the participants being aware of dementia- related digital health interventions, it is noteworthy that they favoured apps and online programs. That is, when asked which modality they would find useful or would recommend to a client if it was designed to help people reduce their risk of getting dementia, more than 60% of participants believed that mobile apps and online programs would be useful. Yet, no significant results were found for the other modalities. Further research would be needed to ascertain the rationale behind these perspectives.\nFinally, it is interesting to note that, while not significant, all three health literacy scores were positively associated with the recommendation of mobile and online\ninterventions. This study is the only known research examining the potential relationship between health literacy and a preference for digital interventions. One study touched on the importance of digital competency and providing digital health recommendations as it reviewed digital health competency frameworks.27 Otherwise, more research is needed in this area."

For instance, it was difficult to discuss the potential association among health literacy, dementia knowledge and preference for digital health modalities when there is little or no existing research. The current study did not investigate why participants were more likely to recommend mobile phone or online interventions. Further research is needed to understand this relationship. There is a potential recruitment bias as students opted in to participate, which may have given rise to a cohort who were interested in health literacy, digital health and dementia. Finally, two of the four tools needed to be developed by the original investigator team. These measures are not validated but address an important gap in the research."

            "text": "This current study shows that health students in healthrelated degrees have high health literacy, but average dementia knowledge and average dementia prevention knowledge. It has demonstrated that knowledge about dementia prevention is associated with a preference for providing patient support for dementia prevention via mobile apps or online programs. While the current study cannot provide an evidence- based rationale for this result, it is proposed that it may be due to familiarity with healthrelated apps, particularly well- marketed brain health apps, which are not necessarily evidence based. The lack of evidence- based knowledge behind which digital health interventions may be useful is further supported by having only 7% of participants having knowledge in this area. Overall, it is recommended that health- related degrees address dementia knowledge and increase awareness regarding effective dementia- related digital health interventions. It is imperative that future health professionals are aware of the substantial prevalence and impact of dementia in the community so that they can effectively care for their clients. Furthermore, their knowledge of the evidence base for digital interventions that will increasingly facilitate quality care is vital.\nnloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/ajag.13149 by B ond U niversity M anager, Inform ation R esources, W iley O nline L ibrary on [13/11/2022].
