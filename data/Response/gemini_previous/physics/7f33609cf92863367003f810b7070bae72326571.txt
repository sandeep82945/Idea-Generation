1. **Investigate the bioavailability and antioxidant properties of cis-isomers of lutein.** 
There is limited data on the bioavailability and antioxidant properties of cis-isomers of lutein. Future research could focus on comparing the bioavailability and antioxidant activities of cis- and trans-isomers of lutein in humans and animal models. This information could help determine the potential health benefits of consuming cis-isomers of lutein.


2. **Explore the role of cis-isomers of lutein in eye health.** 
Lutein is known to accumulate in the macula of the eye, where it is thought to protect against age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, it is not known whether cis-isomers of lutein have similar protective effects. Future research could investigate the role of cis-isomers of lutein in eye health, including their potential to prevent or slow the progression of AMD.


3. **Study the effects of cis-isomers of lutein on cognitive function.** 
Lutein has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, where it may play a role in cognitive function. However, it is not known whether cis-isomers of lutein have similar effects on cognitive function. Future research could investigate the effects of cis-isomers of lutein on cognitive function in humans and animal models.


4. **Examine the potential use of cis-isomers of lutein in food fortification and dietary supplements.** 
Lutein is a valuable nutrient that is often added to food products and dietary supplements to improve their nutritional value. However, most of the lutein that is currently used in food fortification and dietary supplements is in the trans form. Future research could investigate the potential use of cis-isomers of lutein in food fortification and dietary supplements. This research could help determine the optimal forms of lutein for use in these products.


5. **Investigate the potential use of cis-isomers of lutein in cosmetics and skincare products.** 
Lutein has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may be beneficial for skin health. However, it is not known whether cis-isomers of lutein have similar benefits. Future research could investigate the potential use of cis-isomers of lutein in cosmetics and skincare products. This research could help determine the optimal forms of lutein for use in these products.
