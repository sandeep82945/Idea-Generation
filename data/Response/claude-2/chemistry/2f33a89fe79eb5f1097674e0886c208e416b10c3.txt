 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Compare the biological activities (e.g. antioxidant, anti-inflammatory) of the different tissues to determine if the metabolite differences translate to functional differences. 

2. Further characterize the new secondary metabolites discovered in the tissues using techniques like NMR. Determine if they contribute significantly to bioactivities.

3. Study the gene expression and enzymatic regulation involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in each tissue to better understand the metabolite distribution. 

4. Evaluate the effects of growth conditions, harvesting time, processing methods etc on the metabolite composition of the tissues. Optimize protocols to maximize desired compounds.

5. Isolate and identify the active components from each tissue and evaluate their potential pharmacological effects in disease models (e.g. anti-cancer, neuroprotective). Develop tissue-specific therapeutic agents.
