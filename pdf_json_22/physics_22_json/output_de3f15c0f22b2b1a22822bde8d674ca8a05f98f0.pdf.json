    "abstractText": "Emerging new communication standards like 5G or 6G aggravate the circuit design of radiofrequency generation systems as they constantly increase demand on high bandwidths, low latency, and high spectral purity. The utilization of high-Q oscillators, however, provides a possibility of optimisation of radio-frequency oscillators regarding their phase-noise performance in the overall system. This paper analyses one of the most promising electromechanical resonator devices, the resonant fin transistor with respect to its performance and application in oscillator circuit design. Several investigations regarding its working principle, design trade-offs and limits are carried out in this work. An oscillator circuit design is given for two variants of the resonant fin transistor device together with an outlook on its performance compared to other state-of-the-art radio-frequency oscillator designs. Following the performance analyses conducted throughout this work, the fundamental limit for the Q-factor of this resonator is investigated, challenging the validity of functionality of the resonant fin transistor and its potential for circuit applications.

INTRODUCTION\nW ITH the emerging market of 6G, radar, applicationsfor car-to-car communication, internet of things and industry 4.0 the need for higher spectral purity signal generation is rising [1]\u2013[3]. Stable Radio Frequency (RF)-signals with the lowest phase-noise possible are key to these new communication standards to enable high-order modulation schemes and thus high data transfer rates. The most important circuit component in these RF systems with regard to its phase-noise performance is the oscillator. As a frequency generation building block, the oscillator directly impacts and shapes the phase-noise of the complete RF system. One possibility to optimize the oscillator circuit with respect to the lowest phase-noise is the utilization of high quality-factor (Q-factor) resonators [4]. However, those high Q-factors can hardly be attained by current complementary metal-oxide-\nsemiconductor (CMOS) process compatible devices, like conventional LC-based structures, which suffer from severe cross-coupling and large device footprints. To fill in the gap, modern micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) devices like surface-acoustic-wave (SAW)- and bulk-acoustic-wave (BAW)-resonators offer large Q-factors at high frequencies [5]\u2013[10]. Nevertheless, integration of these devices often requires extensive pre- or post-processing, which forces the devices to be fabricated externally on a stand-alone die, increasing cost and limiting performance [11]. One recent device, the so-called resonant fin transistor (RFT)\u2014schematically depict in Fig. 1\u2014gathered much attention as it can be fabricated monolithically in the Front-End-of-Line (FEOL) of the CMOS stack with no additional post-processing required [12]. This is especially beneficial in mobile communication scenarios, where device power and area consumption mat-\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Moreover, the device promises excellent performance, with a Q-factor of 49 000 while resonating at 32 GHz. It utilizes the periodic arrangement of hundreds of adjoining fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) connected as metal-oxidesemiconductor (MOS) capacitors to create a mechanical wave inside a common gate via electromechanical coupling. The wave is picked up in the centre of the cavity as the change in FinFET current, which is caused by a modulation of the carrier mobility through the resonant mode. Several research efforts have been reported in order to take advantage of the performance of this device in an oscillatory circuit [13], [14]. This paper will carry out a more detailed theoretical evaluation of the working principle, performance and its limitations. Thus, we will give an estimate on the device\u2019s significance in RF circuit design for mobile communications and alike.\nAt first, the working principle of the RFT is outlined in Section II. It is followed by the geometrical explanation of the Finite-Element-Method (FEM) setups for the simulations in Section III. The mechanical anisotropy of the silicon wafer in CMOS technologies is discussed in Section IV, along with the investigated wafer orientations. After the mechanical prerequisites, the electromechanical simulation of the drive is explained in Section V. Afterwards, starting with the stress tensor and the derived pressure inside the sense FinFETs the sensing mechanism is explained in Section VI. Lastly, the FEM setups are calibrated with respect to their CMOS capacitance to measured quantities in Section VII and the Qfactor for the FEM simulation is introduced in Section VIII. Section IX presents simulation results of the conducted FEM simulation. Several impacts on the RFT performance by geometry, biasing, temperature and doping are investigated, resulting in a three orders of magnitude lower transconductance than initially reported. Despite these discrepancies, in Section X of the paper, a study on oscillator circuit design,\nutilizing the RFT device for frequency generation, is carried out. Furthermore, a comparison in performance to state-ofthe-art oscillator designs is given to evaluate the significance of the resonator for high-performance RF circuit design. Finally, the paper concludes with caveats and possible improvements of the FEOL resonator in Section XI. Following from insufficient performance of the resonant fin transistor found in this work, and the fundamental Q-factor limit, imposed by the Akhiezer effect and Landau-Rumer regime, the validity of the functionality in prior literature of the resonant fin transistor is challenged."

            "text": "To verify the performance of the RFT and its possible application in circuits, for example as resonant fin oscillator (RFO), three-dimensional FEM simulations were carried out with a commercially available simulator1. The working principle of the RFT is based on MOS capacitor actuation, which couples to a mechanical eigenmode inside a FinFET gate with hundreds of adjacent fins [12]. The best electromechanical coupling can be achieved by driving neighbouring fins with opposite phases, thus directly coupling to the differential eigenmode of the RFT. However, common foundry design rules prevent separated contacts to adjoining fins, therefore a higher spatial harmonic of the mode is driven. This is achieved by connecting groups of three neighbouring FinFET MOS capacitors, while four intermediate fins between the electrical phases are unconnected, thereby forming a 14-fin unit cell (UC). The mode is sensed in the centre of the cavity by a differentially wired FinFET pair, biased at a constant voltage. The mechanical deformation of the FinFETs causes a modulation of the carrier mobility and consequently a modulation of the drain current in the sense transistor pair at the frequency of the eigenmode [12], [14]."

The first, shown in Fig. 2b, models the smallest differential UC, with two adjacent fins. The structure is assumed infinite along the channel direction (X-axis) by utilizing symmetric boundary conditions. This creates a device with an infinite number of parallel fingers. However, this simplification suppresses out-of-plane movements of the gate. Nevertheless, it is still valid, even in the presence of anisotropic materials, as the impact of this assumption on the mechanical performance is negligible, which is studied in more detail in Section IX-A. Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions are deployed along the gate direction (Y-axis), which creates an infinite periodic cavity. The vertical directions (Z-axis) are terminated by perfectly matched layers in order to mimic a thick wafer without reflections in the far distance. As noted before, this configuration cannot be manufactured due to common design rule constraints.

Thus, a larger 14-fin UC is required to be compliant with the design rule constraints, as depicted in Fig. 2c [12]. Fin packs of three, made from fins 3\u20135 or 10\u201312, are jointly connected to the same electric potential with both phases separated by four electrically floating fins.\nThe two electric phases are indicated by the red coloured fins and dotted box and the blue coloured ones with a dashed box, as depicted in Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c, respectively. To also quantify the impact of a finite amount of fingers and dummy fingers, a third simulation setup, shown in Fig. 2d, is used. The UC is based on the smallest 2-fin UC, however, it is now finite along the channel direction. Therefore, a certain number of active and dummy fingers can be modelled. The latter are required to control the electrical performance by creating an even surrounding for the active gates. The impact of a finite cavity on the final result is not studied in this work. The performance is expected to degrade with a shorter cavity length and badly matched termination, but further investigation is required to prove these expectations. Typical modern Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) stacks for integrated circuits (ICs) consist of a low-\u03ba dielectric such as SiCO:H,\nwith copper for wiring. Copper, which is a highly anisotropic material, strongly affects the acoustic band gap formation in the phononic crystal (PnC) as the compliance changes for different crystallographic orientations [15], [16]. To reduce complexity the BEOL is neglected in this study as it may vary strongly between different foundries and technology nodes. Thus, the BEOL is replaced by an SiO2 slab in all simulations. Both the silicon wafer as well as the SiO2 slab are able to confine the resonant mode due to index guiding for frequencies well in excess of the resonant mode\u2019s frequency [12], [17]. The higher porosity SiCO:H cannot be used for confinement as the index guiding properties are not sufficient. Hence, for modern SiCO:H based BEOL stacks a PnC mirror is obligatory, but further investigation is required."

Several of the involved cubic materials exhibit anisotropic mechanical effects which alter the response of the MEMS [15], [18]\u2013[21]. The mechanical properties of all materials used in this work are listed in Table 1. Consequently, as a result of the mechanical anisotropy of silicon, four common wafer orientations, depicted in Fig. 3, are investigated. For the first wafer (001) orientation, with the wafer normal pointing along [001] as shown in Fig. 3a, the crystal axes align with the spatial axes. The second configuration (001)45, depicted in Fig. 3b, is rotated clockwise around the wafer normal by 45\u00b0, which is the typical orientation used in foundry processes due to its beneficial electrical response to uni-axial strain along the channel direction [110] [27]\u2013[31]. The third wafer orientation (011) was added for completeness and does not exhibit known electrical or mechanical benefits over the other orientations. The wafer normal for the last orientation, shown in Fig. 3d, is pointing along [111]. This orientation is often times deemed beneficial for MEMS designs as Young\u2019s modulus, Poisson\u2019s ratio and shear modulus are isotropic in the {111} planes [18], [20], [21]."

The drive MOS capacitors and gates are biased at a constant direct current (dc) voltage Vdrive = 40 mV and Vgate = 800 mV for the NMOS and Vdrive = 760 mV and Vgate = 0 V for the PMOS, respectively, as proposed in [12]. The initial stress inside the FEOL, introduced by the dc bias, is simulated with a stationary electromechanical simulation. For this pre-stressed structure, the possible mechanical eigenmodes are computed. All simulation setups support multiple resonant modes, however, not all can be coupled electromechanically for symmetry reasons. Depending on the exact configuration of the setups, a strong differential eigenmode, with regard to adjacent fins, can be found between 30\u2013 35 GHz. It is exemplarily depicted in Fig. 4 for the ideal 2-fin UC, separated in the displacements along the three principal axes. In resonance, adjacent fins expand and compress periodically around the channel. The mode causes only little deformation along the channel direction (X-axis) as shown in Fig. 4a. Along the gate direction (Y-axis), however, shown in Fig. 4b, the fins are alternately contracted and expanded. The same also applies to the vertical direction (Z-axis) illustrated in Fig. 4c. Those deformations lead to a breathing motion of adjacent fins and result in opposite stress, orthogonal to the channel direction, in neighbouring FinFETs. The overall displacement is also indicated in all three setups shown in Fig. 2.\nIt should be noted, that the larger the size of the UC is assumed, the more spurious modes can coexist, which in\nturn further degrades the performance of the device. In this work, all spurious modes are filtered out. Only the dominant mechanical eigenmode, referred to as RFT mode, depicted in Fig. 4, is investigated. The RFT mode is then used in an electro-mechanical frequency domain eigenmode simulation, considering the pre-stressed state, with an alternating current (ac) drive voltage amplitude of vdrive = 30 mV [12]. The Q-factor of the mode is limited to Q = 1000 via Rayleigh damping, to offer greater numerical stability."

As a result of the simplified gate stack, the fin to gate capacitance is overestimated in our simulations. Thus the dielectric constant r = 25 of the high-\u03baHfO2 is scaled to the effective dielectric constant required to match simulation and measurement [23], [25]. The factors are calculated to r,nmos = r/4.05 and r,pmos = r/3.2. The measured and simulated capacitance of the structure is shown in Fig. 7 for some chosen gate lengths. The single fin capacitances are obtained from de-embedded RF measurements between 25\u201340 GHz from a larger device with four parallel gates and 30 fins, resulting in capacitances in the pF range. The gate length values correspond to the drawn gate length, however, a constant technology dependant offset for the gate length is considered in the simulations. After calibration, the capacitance of the NMOS and PMOS FinFETs are in excellent agreement with the measured data. Both measurement and simulation are fitted by linear regression as a guide to the eye. As the electromechanical force in a capacitor, formed between gate and fin, changes linearly with the capacitance, the fin pressure p also scales linearly with the relative permittivity of the high-\u03ba layer as shown in Fig. 8. The changed relative permittivity does not affect the frequency of the resonance. Solely the anti-resonance is affected as electromechanical coupling changes with the static capacitance of the MEMS [14], [33], [34]. With an increasing static capacitance, the coupling coefficient is reduced. Therefore, the 14 UC should perform worse as the capacitance of the drive is threefold of the 2-fin counterparts. However, this effect is neglected in the following as the geometric variation and dependence on the Q-factor are assumed more important for the performance."

A well-matched BEOL mirror can reduce losses and thereby increase the Qfactor. However, the copper metal layers are neither isotropic nor mono crystalline, which makes the modelling challenging [15], [16]. During fabrication, copper is crystallizing into grains with distinct orientations [16]. This effect further complicates the band gap formation as all metal layers would therefore exhibit varying mechanical properties based on the grain size and orientation. In the worst case the BEOL would not be able to form a PnC and thus provide no shielding for the RFT. Moreover, current CMOS BEOL stacks are optimized for the electrical performance of existing devices, making adaptions for the needs of a singular device challenging. However, further investigations and in-depth analysis are required. Other SAW and BAW devices achieve Q-factors in the 100\u201310 000 range, although at much lower frequencies. They typically fall into the mega- to low gigahertz regime, with a few notable exemptions surpassing 100 000 [5]\u2013[9].\nMany of those designs, however, are partially released structures, which suffer mainly from anchor losses. Monolithic integration, on the other hand, requires extensive shielding in all directions. Therefore, more research is required to substantiate the\u2014considering the results from prior art, surprisingly high\u2014reportedQ-factor of 49 000 [12]. Due to the increased complexity and the variance of the BEOL for each foundry and process node it was removed from the simulations and the Q-factor is added only via Rayleigh damping, which in turn enables the usage of arbitrary values. The RFT is thus modelled at a much lower Q-factor of 1000 for greater numerical stability, convergence and speed in the FEM simulations. Furthermore, it provides a worst-case approximation, in the case of a lower Q-factor than reported, for the circuit simulation in Section X.\nThe impact of a changing Q-factor on the pressure in\nresonance is shown in Fig. 9. It was varied between 100\u2013 500 000, however, the change in pressure at fR scales linearly over multiple orders of magnitude as a result of the employed Rayleigh damping formalism. Thus, all simulations are carried out at a Q-factor of 1000, and can be scaled with:\npnew = p1000 Qnew 1000\n(5)\nto the desired Q-factor Qnew. This is only true for the resonance frequency and can not be used to scale the full spectrum to a new Q-factor. Note that (5) is only valid under the assumption of a linear mechanical response, however, the fins displacements are small, and thus justifying this assumption."

The simulations for the 2-fin UC were compared for a simplified geometry, with only half of a gate modelled (compare Fig. 2b), and a structure with a full gate and periodic boundary conditions in all lateral directions (compare Fig. 2a). The results of the half gate UC are unfolded at the symmetric boundary, and the resonant frequencies and absolute peak pressures are compared in Fig. 11a for several selected gate lengths for an NMOS device, to the full gate UC. For all orientations, the absolute pressure increases with longer gate lengths, as shown in Fig. 11a, whereas the resonant frequency decreases at the same time. The deviation between the modelled full\ngate and half gate is small for the orientations (001), (001)45 and (011) as shown in Fig. 11b. For these orientations, the symmetry plane of the simplification aligns with one of the cubic symmetry planes of the anisotropic silicon. In those instances, both simulations yield almost identical results. However, if the simplification plane of the simulation UC does not align with one of the material symmetries\u2014as is the case for (111)\u2014the results will deviate from each other. In the case of misalignment, the gate experiences additional lateral bending motions along the X-axis, which are caused by an antisymmetric poisons ratio, resulting in a more pronounced shift. Moreover, the structure can also support additional modes, for example with displacements normal to the X-plane, which were suppressed by the symmetric boundary condition. However, all deviations are minor for the investigated wafer directions with the largest deviation in pressure being 14 kPa and in frequency 13 MHz, which justifies the usage of the simplified geometry regardless of the wafer orientation.\nB. INFLUENCE OF A FINITE FINGER COUNT The previous simulations assume an infinite number of parallel fingers due to the symmetric boundary conditions. A real device, however, has a finite number of fingers which are supported by a variable amount of dummy fingers on both sides. Dummy fingers serve only for structural uniformity as the fins are etched away in the region indicated by the dashed green box in Fig. 2d. The UC depicted in Fig. 2d is finite along the X-axis with a perfectly matched layer after the dummy fingers and a symmetric boundary condition on the opposite side in the centre of the RFT cavity. The depicted UC has eight true fingers which are protected by three dummy fingers on each side. The simulations were repeated for a (001)45 wafer orientation and a gate length of 24 nm. The number of fingers and dummy fingers was swept from 1\u201310 and 1\u20133 , respectively. The resulting resonant frequencies for NMOS and PMOS devices are shown in Fig. 12. For a single finger, the resonant frequency is higher when compared to the infinite case (compare Fig. 10). However, for an increasing number of fingers, the resonant frequency assimilates to the infinite case. The number of dummy fingers on the other hand does not influence the resonant frequency. The same behaviour is to be expected in the case of a semi-\nVOLUME 4, 2016 7\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

FINITE CAVITY LENGTH The impact of the cavity length, i.e. the number of consecutive fins also impacts the performance. All simulations were carried out for an infinite number of fins, however, for a finite cavity length, the performance of the device should degrade as cavity termination plays a more important role. A termination similar to the BEOL reflector could be used, however, many different variations are possible and all should perform worse than the infinite assumption of the cavity. Therefore the infinity cavity assumption, very likely, overestimates the final result.\nD.

The results are shown in Fig. 13, for varying dc voltages Vmos = Vgate \u2212 Vdrive over the MOS capacitor and ac drive amplitude. With an increasing dc voltage |Vmos| and an increasing ac voltage, the pressure inside the channel is rising. The larger the voltage difference between the channel of the MOS capacitor and gate, the higher the electro-mechanical force. This trend is limited by the breakthrough voltage of the\ngate oxide as well as the forward bias condition of the welldiodes. However, for both NMOS and PMOS devices the gate oxide is the limiting factor. The grey region highlights all bias combinations for Vgate\u2212(Vdrive+|vdrive|)| > 1 V, which could potentially damage the MOS capacitors. The difference in pressures for the NMOS and PMOS devices is a factor of 1.266 which is caused by the different dielectric permittivity used for the gate oxide. When considering the gate oxide reliability, with a reduction of 50 mV for safety reasons, the optimum bias point for the highest mechanical pressure can be found. A mechanical improvement factor of approximately ten, over the values used by [12], can be achieved by moving the dc bias point to Vdrive = 325 mV for the NMOS and Vdrive = 575 mV for the PMOS with an ac amplitude for both to vdrive = 475 mV. This bias point produces the largest deformation and is therefore the optimum from a mechanical perspective.

At low channel doping densities around 1\u00d7 1015 cm\u22123, which are typical for modern FinFET processes, the piezoresistive effect is enhanced with temperature for both n-Si and pSi [44]. With larger doping densities, scattering processes increase and the overall mobility decreases [45], [46]. The absolute enhancement, however, is moderate in both cases, with an increase of only 50 % at 200 K for n-Si and p-Si. As such temperatures are difficult to maintain in a real-world application, all following considerations are carried out at\nroom temperature. Modern CMOS devices are initially strained along the channel direction during fabrication. By adding germanium to the epitaxial source- drain contacts the channel is compressed, effectively enhancing the mobility for PMOS devices. NMOS devices can be improved by adding a stress layer to the device, effectively putting the channel under tension and thereby increasing mobility [31]. This pre-existing strain is not considered in our simulations as only the harmonic response of the system is considered. This is possible due to the linearity of the piezoelectric model where the static part does not contribute to the final result. Using a method like k \u00b7 p which is not linear at large strain the result might be different, however further analysis is required [29], [47], [48]."

            "text": "For the ideal configuration, each fin is connected to a different electric potential, however, for the real 14-fin UC, groups of three fins are jointly connected to the same potential, as shown in Fig. 2c. The overall mobility change in each three fin package is calculated from the sum of the individual fins:\n\u2206\u00b5 = \u2206\u00b53 + \u2206\u00b54 + \u2206\u00b55 \u2248 \u2206\u00b53, (11)\nWith the subscript denoting the fin number indicated in Fig. 2c. For the second group, the mobility change can be calculated from fins 10 to 12, respectively although the absolute mobility change in both groups should be identical with opposite signs, as a result of the linearity of the piezoresistance model. For each fin, a separate stress tensor is extracted and used for the calculation. In resonance, all fins are deformed equally with a phase shift of 180\u00b0 between neighbouring fins. Therefore the total mobility change in (11) is equal to the change inside a single fin as two fins in each group cancel. Using a more accurate model like the k \u00b7 p perturbation method, the mobility change is not linear and saturates at different levels for opposing signs of stress which would prevent a perfect cancellation in each group [29], [47], [48]. However, the pressures are in the low MPa range and saturation is not reached. The mobility change for the 14- fin UC is shown in Fig. 18. The trends are almost identical compared to the 2-fin configuration with the (001)45 PMOS device, shown in Fig. 18b, again outperforming all other orientations. However, the absolute mobility enhancement is reduced by a factor of approximately seven compared to the 2-fin UC. This can be explained as only two fins out of the 14-fin UC are actively contributing to the driving and sensing of the resonant mode due to the previously described cancellation. Minor deviations between the 14-fin and 2- fin UC can be discerned, which may be attributed to minor differences in the actual mode shape during a frequency domain simulation in the larger UC.\nIn order to achieve the largest mobility enhancement inside the sense transistor units, the PMOS is the preferred choice over NMOS devices. Furthermore, the (001)45 wafer is on a similar level as the other orientations when it comes to\nthe NMOS, but outperforms all of them for the PMOS devices. To achieve the best mobility enhancement and thus the biggest ac current, the least amount of parallel fingers is preferential. Not only due to the overall reduced mobility with each added finger, but also the increasing dc current, which increases the power consumption of the device."

For the 14- fin UC the ac current is analogously derived from the sum of the individual fins in each group with:\nisense = Isense \u2206\u00b53 \u00b50 + Isense \u2206\u00b54 \u00b50 + Isense \u2206\u00b55 \u00b50\n\u2248 Isense \u2206\u00b53 \u00b50 , (13)\nwith the single fin current Idc and the mobility variation from the individual fins. Again, two fins cancel as a result of the linearity at small pressures. Therefore the absolute ac current is accounted for by just one fin out of each group in the UC. From the ac voltage at the drive MOS capacitors and the ac current at the sense transistors the mechanical transconductance [12]:\nGm = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 isensevdrive \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (14)\nis calculated. Note that effects such as the stress induced shift of the silicon band gap and subsequent threshold voltage shift in the sense transistors as well as velocity saturation have not been considered in this model [52], [53]. Their impact is expected to be negligible as the simulated stress levels are small. Possible modelling approaches have been shown in [54].\nIt is shown for both FinFET types on the optimal wafer orientation (001)45 for the infinite two and 14-fin UCs in Fig. 21. The transconductance is almost plateauing for gate lengths up to 40 nm. In this region the increase in mobility and the decrease in current compensate each other, however, for longer gates, the transconductance starts to decrease as the mobility enhancement cannot counteract the current decrease. Again the 2-fin configuration outperforms the 14- fin UC by a factor of approximately seven. Considering all displayed configurations a 24 nm gate length is the best over all variants. Those results are scaled to Q = 50 000 with (5) and shown in Fig. 22. At a Q-factor of 50 000 the 14-fin UC achieves a mechanical transconductance in the\nlow \u00b5S regime. The Gm can be improved by utilizing more parallel fingers, as the dc current and hereby ac current would increase. However, an important figure of merit to consider is the transconductance per dc current as it is the main contribution to the power consumption of the device. The best configuration possible, without major adjustments to the CMOS process, is the 2-fin configuration with Q = 50 000, where each fin is actively driven without sparse fins inbetween, achieves 100 \u00b5S for the NMOS and 565 \u00b5S for the PMOS, respectively.\nAnalogously to Section IX-D the optimal bias condition for the largest transconductance at a sense bias of 200 mV can be found as shown in Fig. 23. The transconductance for the previously optimized bias point is worse than the original bias condition, albeit the increased mobility enhancement. As the drive voltage increases so does the pressure and further the ac sense current, however the latter increases at a slower rate which worsens the transconductance. From a circuit perspective, the best bias condition must be chosen, in accordance with the circuit requirements like signal amplitude and phase-noise. It is in-between the points for the optimal transconductance and the best mechanical performance. A feasibility study for an RFO circuit with the new results at the best mechanical bias point is carried out in the next section.\nA discrepancy of two orders of magnitude was found between our simulated mechanical transconductance in com-"

Our analysis yields only 0.1 mS for the NMOS and 0.565 mS for the PMOS RFT with a Q-factor of 50 000. Furthermore, a Gm of 14 mS with a drive voltage of vdrive = 30 mV would require an ac output at the sense transistor of isense = 420 \u00b5A. Given the reported dc currents of the sense transistor at Isense = 120 \u00b5A a mobility enhancement of 350 % is required [12]. An enhancement of this magnitude is not reported in literature for silicon. The largest enhancements possible according to prior art, require stress in the low gigapascal range for a change up to approximately 60 % [29], [31], [47], [55]\u2013[58]. However, for all possible CMOS compatible voltage combinations (compare Fig. 13) only low megapascal pressures inside the RFT FinFETs were found. Even with an increased Q-factor of 50 000, the pressure does not surpass 700 MPa for the PMOS and therefore will suffice only for a \u00b5S transconductance. Low megapascal values for the RFT were also reported in literature, further substantiating the lower Gm [13]. Thus, considering our simulations results and the material properties reported in literature, high values for Gm above 1 mS seem impossible to reach by the RFT device.\nX. CIRCUIT DESIGN As already discussed in Sec. I an important application for the RFT resonator can be found in the field of RF circuit design. Therefore, in this section, despite the decreased performance as described in Sec.

The oscillator topology has to serve four main purposes in order to achieve a stable oscillation: 1) biasing of the RFT sense transistors, 2) transformation of the sense current into a voltage signal, 3) amplification of the sense signal to an appropriate drive voltage for the RFT input, and 4) phase correction of the fed-back sense signal.

For a rough worst-case noise- and power estimation a simple inverter-based buffer chain is implemented with a total gain of kAmp = 5938 \u2261 75.5 dB. The buffer chain has a length of nine stages with accoupling and dc-biasing in-between each stage as depicted in Fig. 28. The stages are scaled in their size, starting at minimal transistor dimensioning at the first stage up to a multiplication factor of four at later stages, respectively. For the subsequent circuit analysis and simulation, the additional phase shift induced by the feedback amplifier is neglected. For a complete RFO implementation, a phase compensation has to be integrated. The noise estimation is done by calculating the input-referred noise at each stage of the amplifier using its small-signal equivalent circuit diagram [63]:\nV 2in,n = 4kbT\u03b3\ngm,PMOS,n + gm,NMOS,n , (23)\nwith n being the stage number ranging from 1 to 9, gm,*,n representing the transconductance of the NMOS- and PMOStransistors in the buffer, kb as Boltzmann constant, T as absolute temperature in K and \u03b3 as noise coefficient.

This noise voltage is taken as flat noise contribution over the complete frequency span of interest (1 Hz \u2013 100 GHz) for further circuit simulations, in order to get a worst-case estimation for the phase-noise contribution of the amplifier to the overall RFO phase-noise. Effects of flicker-noise in the amplifier are not taken into account by the used flat noise characteristic. For the PRFO the loop-gain can be determined to kGain = 2.423 \u00b7 10\u22123, which enables a decreased gain-target for the feedback amplifier. For the oscillator implementation, the same amplifier is used as for the NRFO circuit. The number of stages is reduced to n = 7 resulting in a total gain of kAmp = 806 \u2261 58.1 dB and a flat noise contribution of V 2out,tot = 0.013 nV2/Hz.

Thus a tuned amplifier with reduced bandwidth would be more suitable for the feedback amplifier. This topology uses tuned LC-tanks to achieve a narrow bandwidth. The biggest drawback of these architectures is their larger layout-area because of the tank inductors. Furthermore, to ensure the needed feedback-gain of over 50 dB, multiple amplifier stages are needed. It should be also noted, that, no matter which amplifier architecture is chosen, each additional amplifier stage in the feedback loop of the RFO increases the chip-area of the oscillator device and, due to the low Q-factor of the amplifier-tank, impacts the phase-noise of the complete circuit. Therefore, both main advantages of the RFT as resonant device in the oscillator, namely small size and excellent phase-noise due to the high Q-factor, are negatively impacted by the need of additional amplifier stages in the feedback. Nevertheless, the simulations in the following section, conducted using the inverterbased feedback amplifier give a good basic estimation of the achievable performance of an RFO-implementation.

Values collected from [6], [12], [67], [68].\nare affiliated, the controversy of the reported values in both publications may not be disregarded.\nXI. CONCLUSION Our study confirmed the basic working principle proposed by [12]. It was investigated with FEM simulations, which brought insights into the best device configuration from a mechanical perspective. The RFT performs best on a (001)45 oriented silicon wafer with a gate length of 24 nm. Here the carrier mobility variation inside the sense unit is the largest, in both NMOS and PMOS type devices. Considering a multifinger device the optimum is found to be at a singular gate as mechanical displacement and hereby mobility modulation degrade with an increasing number of fingers. Considering a 14 UC with a Q-factor of 50 000 at the default bias values the device could achieve a theoretical mechanical transconductance of 15 \u00b5S for NMOS and 90 \u00b5S for PMOS devices, respectively. Although the basic functionality of the devices was confirmed by our simulations, a discrepancy to the reported value of 14 mS was found. Given the uncertainty of the reported Q-factor and the unreasonably high carrier mobility enhancements, the results reported in [12] could not be verified.\nNevertheless, the transconductance of the RFT can be improved by different means: Firstly by adding more parallel fingers, which increases isense. This comes at the expense of a higher power consumption as the gain per additional finger is decreasing while each finger contributes to the overall dc current of the device. Secondly, theGm can be slightly improved by cooling the device to sub-ambient temperatures, which is challenging in a real-world application. Thirdly, an improvement up to a factor of seven can be achieved by enabling single fin contacts without sparse fins in the UC, effectively replicating the results of the 2-fin UC. Single fin contacts also allow for a reduction of the dc current by a factor of three, thereby reducing the power consumption. However, tighter FEOL and BEOL integration on this scale requires extensive lithography evolutions, which stand in contrast to the low reported performance of the RFO especially in the presence of better performing devices. And lastly, by switching to a different technology, incorporating either piezoelectric or ferroelectric materials, the coupling coefficient and therefore the\nmechanical transconductance could potentially be improved [5], [8], [9], [69], [70]. Nevertheless, a functional RFO circuit concept was designed with an optimized bias condition for both NMOS- and PMOS-variant of the RFT. It was evaluated for several Q-factors, ranging from a lower more plausible Q-factor of 1000 to the reported 50 000 from [12]. The FoM of the oscillator circuit design, which is based on a cascodeamplifier with additional ideal gain in the feedback-loop, achieves values for a Q-factor of 1000 of 153 dBc/Hz for the NRFO and 170 dBc/Hz for the PRFO, which is quite low compared to other state-of-the-art RF-designs (compare Fig. 30). This makes the RFT unattractive for competitive RF-circuit design for frequency generation. Furthermore, the authors of [12] fail to substantiate the claim of the astonishingly large Q \u00b7 f product of 1.57\u00d7 1015. Considering all damping mechanisms, like the Akhiezer effect (AKE) and Landau-Rumer (LR) attenuation, as well as the thermoelastic dissipation (TED) and the PnC, the total Q-factor of the RFT is limited by the Matthiessen\u2019s rule [67], [68], [71]\u2013[73]\n1\nQRFT =\n1\nQAKE +\n1\nQLR +\n1\nQPnC +\n1\nQTED + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (26)\nto the smallest Q-factor of all involved loss mechanisms. For well designed high frequency devices the losses by TED are negligible [72], [74]. For frequencies \u03c9\u03c4\u03c4l < 1, where \u03c4l = 67.3 ps is the relaxation time of longitudinal waves in silicon along the gate direction \u3008110\u3009, the AKE is expected to be the dominant attenuation source [67]. It limits theQ-factor to the phonon-phonon attenuation limit [75], [76]. Here the Q \u00b7 f product is given by [77], [78]\nQAKE \u00b7 f = \u03c1c2l c 2 d\n6\u03c0\u03b32kT (27)\nwhere the Debye velocity [74], [75]\nc\u22123d = 2c\u22123t + c \u22123 l\n3 (28)\nis calculated from the longitudinal and transversal sound wave velocities in silicon along the gate direction \u3008110\u3009 with cl = 9130 m s\n\u22121 and ct = 4672 m s\u22121 [75]. The Gr\u00fcneisen parameter \u03b3 varies between 0.17\u20131.5 with the commonly used average \u03b3avg = 0.51, however, it is challenging to\nVOLUME 4, 2016 17\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Moreover k = 130\u2013148 W K\u22121 m\u22121 is the thermal conductivity and T = 300 K the temperature [77], [78]. The AKE, as plotted in Fig. 31 for the upper and lower limit as well as the average, impose the fundamental limit of the frequency product by means of quantum mechanical phonon scattering, which solely relies on the involved materials [67], [79], [80]. High performing MEMS devices in that realm rarely exceed the average Q \u00b7 f product as shown for selected silicon MEMS.\nFor resonators with frequencies in excess of \u03c9\u03c4\u03c4l > 1, the Q \u00b7 f product is limited by the LR attenuation. In this region the wavelength is smaller than the mean free phonon path causing an acoustic attenuation proportional to \u03c9 as a result of three-phonon interactions [74]. Here theQ\u00b7f product [74], [76]\nQLR \u00b7 f = 30\u03c1c5d~3\n\u03c04\u03b32kbT 4 f (29)\nincreases linearly with frequency. Again, top performing MEMS rarely surpass the average LR attenuation. However, although the MEMS are limited by LR and may thus surpass the AKE in this frequency range, Q \u00b7 f above the AKE are unreported [71].\nNevertheless the RFT approaches the upper limit, reporting the best performance to the current date [12]. This value however, is improbable as the performance of the BEOL PnC is questionable in the presence of anisotropic copper which strongly alters the band gap formation [15]. Furthermore, the RFT is built out of several different materials, including high porosity SiCO:H in close proximity to the cavity, which should worsen the theoretical upper limit of theQ \u00b7f product. Regardless of the validity of the Q-factor, our simulations, including all assumptions and considered effects shown in Sections IV to IX, could not confirm the reported transconductance. It is calculated to be three orders of magnitude lower than reported making the device ineffective for IC design.\nREFERENCES [1] G. Wikstr\u00f6m, J. Peisa, P. Rugeland, N. Johansson, S.
