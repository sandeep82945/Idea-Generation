    "abstractText": "Microand small-scale enterprises (MSEs) have emerged as one of the most important tools for addressing economic and social issues and achieving development goals. In both developed and developing economies, MSEs have been acknowledged as critical components of national development. This study aimed to assess the contributions of MSEs toward sustainable community livelihood in Emba Alaje, Wereda, Ethiopia. The results revealed that MSEs contributed to economic growth, employment formation, and income generation for the local community. In addition, the study indicated that the MSEs were significantly affected by different determinant factors such as infrastructures, raw material, working premises, and human capital. The study clearly showed that there was a gender gap over participation in different MSE sectors. In addition, many sectors which can employ more people are still managed by men. This shows that the bodies involved, such as the MSE Development Offices, Bureau of Cooperatives, and Bureau of Works and Social Affairs, should join their hands and allow women to enter traditionally male-dominated sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and urban farming. Above all, greater efforts should be made to consider both femaleand male-owned businesses.",

            "text": "Globally, micro- and small-scale enterprises (MSEs) are known for their important contribution to economic growth (Osotimehin et\u00a0al., 2012) and job creation (Matthew et\u00a0al., 2020). MSEs have become one of the most important tools for dealing with economic and social issues and achieving development goals in both developed and developing nations (Bai et\u00a0al., 2021; Miah et\u00a0al., 2015; OECD, 2017a). The OECD (2017b) statistics showed that MSEs make up more than 60% of the gross domestic product in developing economies and more than 70% of the total employment. The MSEs sector is seen as a key catalyst for jobs, unemployment, and social development as a whole since the lion share of rapidly increasing workforce worldwide (Awartani & Millis, 2018) ranges from 48 to 51% in Latin America, 65% in Asia, and 72% in the Sub-Saharan African countries (ILO, 2002). In most economies, the MSEs make up more than 90% of the total income (Razak et\u00a0al., 2018; Tambunan, 2020). They are lent the highest employment growth rates (Geremewe, 2018), and they represent a large share of industrial production and exports (Abebe & Gebremariam, 2021; Fava, 2021; Taiwo et\u00a0 al., 2012). Since agriculture is the second largest sector of employment in Ethiopia, MSEs as major part of the agricultural industry are of great importance in this country. According to Fufa (2015), there were 974,676 micro- and 31,863 small businesses in Ethiopia representing 99.40% and 0.46% of industrial establishments, respectively. According to a national study performed by the Central Statistical Agency, more than 1.3 million people work in MSEs (CSA, 2007). However, many MSEs could not expand and remained in survival forms that could not provide work (Gebremeskel, 2018). Around 69% of 1000 MSEs were known as survival forms (Tefera et\u00a0al., 2013).\nSince 2001, significant efforts have been made in Tigray to eliminate poverty and unemployment in a broader context through the growth of micro- and small businesses. As a result, the number of companies rose from 49,392 in 2003 to 106,745 in 2009. The majority of MESs (52%), which existed in Tigray, were owned by females; 75,225% of them in cities with a service in the same area, and the remaining 24,727 were located in growing cities with no single service center identified. It was possible to create permanent and temporary employment opportunities for 193,286 residents by promoting and expanding micro- and small businesses. MSEs\u2019 key constraints included finance credit issues; lack of workplace; business challenges; lack of managerial skills, fee, and rent money; etc. (Admasu, 2012; Hadis & Ali, 2018).\nMost studies in academic and non-academic institutions (e.g., Abebe & Gemeda, 2020; Agyapong, 2010; Jibir, 2015; Meressa, 2020) focus on factors that hinder MSEs growth and program outcomes in aggregate forms. Empirical research on the function of MSEs in community development have not evaluated the role of MSEs in the community. For example, Abebe and Gemeda (2020) searched at poor government regulation, infrastructure investment, management, financial, legal, and marketing challenges as factors that affect the growth of MSEs in Asella City, Ethiopia, such as lack of clear job descriptions among members, high collateral requirements from financial institutions, lack of training, and poor linkage of MSEs to the market. As a result, the concerned office should assist MSEs in overcoming obstacles to their growth. To assist SMEs expand, MSEs should be connected to the market, and members should create a collaborative culture (Gupta & Tripathi, 2020).\nIn addition, most of the previous empirical studies typically tended to focus on spatial distribution, opportunity, and growth of MSEs. To highlight the global novelty, this study\nseeks to examine the gap in the contribution of MSEs to community livelihood through the role of financial capitals in income generation, economic growth, and sustainable community development. Moreover, limited studies have been made to assess MSEs\u2019 contributions toward sustainable livelihoods in Emba Alaje Wereda."

            "text": "In many industrialized countries, the concept of MSEs varies from that of other developing nations. Throughout developing countries, micro-enterprises can be categorized as smallor medium-sized. In fact, MSEs generate the great majority of businesses and have contributed significantly to job creation and economic growth in Europe, Japan, and the USA (Habtewold, 2019; Okamuro et\u00a0al., 2018). Similarly, many Sub-Saharan African countries registered high levels of MSEs in the economy (Newa, 2010; Abebe, 2021).\nA vast range of activities characterize the MSE sector, which can provide livelihood prospects for a substantial portion of the population. This suggests that the sector can quickly alleviate unemployment and poverty. To attain a modest level of living, the government and other stakeholders must take active action and help to eliminate unemployment and boost the job and self-employment markets (Agenssa & Premanandam, 2021; Gomez, 2008). As a result, a concept is needed to categorize the sector so that all necessary support and facilities can be channeled into this diverse sector (Geremewe, 2018).\nThe strategy of MSE development in Ethiopia categorizes businesses according to the capital and number of employees (Zemenu & Mohammed, 2014). An enterprise that employs five people, including its owner, and whose total assets are less than 100,000 birr in the industry (mining, construction, and manufacturing) sector is called a micro-enterprise. Micro-enterprises functioning in the service sector (retailer, transport, hotel and tourist, Information Communication Technology (ICT) and maintenance service) have a staff of five people, including the owner, and a total asset worth of less than 50,000 birr (Tsegaye, 2019). A small business in the industrial sector is identified as the one that employs 6\u201330 people and has a paid-up capital of at least 100,000 birr but a total assets of less than 1.5 million birr. Small enterprises in the service sector are defined as those employing 6\u201330 employees or having a paid-up capital of 50,000 birr and a total assets of less than 500,000 birr (Table\u00a01)."

            "text": "Phillips and Pittman (2009) defined community development as a determined endeavor to build assets that strengthen citizens\u2019 potential to improve their quality of life. Several types\n1 3\nof community capital could be considered as such assets (i.e., physical, environmental capital, human, and financial). Community development can be characterized as the process of collective action creation and enhancement. In fact, this is the result in various fields such as physical, environmental, cultural, financial, political, economic, and other areas for the development of a community. In general, community development refers to the ability of the people to coordinate and mobilize resources for the achievement of consensusbuilt goals (Eshetu & Mammo, 2009; Kazungu et\u00a0al., 2014; Westlund & Nilsson, 2005). In both developed and developing economies, MSEs have been recognized as indispensable components of national development. They have also been recognized internationally as economic growth and development instruments (Oppong et\u00a0 al., 2014; Osotimehin et\u00a0 al., 2012). Overall, MSEs can only contribute to long-term community development if and only if they are integrated into a holistic approach to community development that considers social, economic, and environmental factors. As a result, MSEs in both developed and developing countries are frequently regarded as a springboard for long-term growth (Oppong et\u00a0 al., 2014; Osotimehin et\u00a0 al., 2012). According to recent research (e.g., Senthilkumar, 2021; Tsegaye, 2019), Ethiopia\u2019s MSE sector is the second greatest source of employment after agriculture. As a method for poverty reduction and job creation, MSEs are especially important for women (Wasihun & Paul, 2010; Gichuki et\u00a0al., 2015). MSEs have demonstrated their tremendous effect on rapid economic growth in successful developing countries due to their size, location, capital investment, and capacity to generate more employment (Mamo et\u00a0al., 2021). The MSE sector has also aided economic transition by providing a large number of people with adequate quality and reasonably priced goods and services, especially in rural areas, and by using the skills and talents of a large number of people without requiring advanced training, large sums of capital, or advanced technologies. In 1997, Ethiopia published its first national MSMEs Development and Promotion Strategy, which was followed by the formulation of a Women Policy in 1998, the formation of the Federal MSMEs Development Agency, The Ethiopia\u2019s Industrial Development Strategy was published in 2003, that all intended to develop MSMEs development and empower women in particular by making it easier to find resources and participate in economic activities (Gebremariam, 2017; Wasihun & Paul, 2010).\nThrough a combination of these measures, the small business sector as an influential force can provide the ideal environment for entrepreneurs to efficiently exercise their talents, achieve their goals, generate employment and more equitable income distribution, activate competition, exploit niche markets, increase productivity, and stimulate economic development. Wasihun and Paul (2010) demonstrated that the importance of MSMEs in generating employment and income in a community is generally acknowledged, particularly among women, and that they have become a key potential for policymakers and donors seeking to boost growth while also alleviating poverty (Fig.\u00a01)."

            "text": "Despite the fact that MSEs have made significant contributions to community development by increasing community capital and allowing communities to unleash their resources, MSEs face a number of challenges that prevent them from fully operating and bringing about change (Matthew et\u00a0al., 2020; Osotimehin et\u00a0al., 2012). Despite the fact that female entrepreneurs face a variety of problems, they are unable to solve them on their own. Another big challenge is the lack of a strong support system that can help MSEs solve their problems. Furthermore, it was commonly regarded as a sign of backwardness for a long\n1 3\ntime in the history of MSEs\u2019 growth and expansion. Lack of another option in all segments of society, as well as the perception of MSEs as reflections of poverty and a backward attitude toward rent seeking, hampered MSEs\u2019 development (FDRE, 2017). These constraints encompass limited markets, lack of access to affordable finance, lack of input storage, lack of transport facilities, and lack of adequate resources or mechanisms (poor technology). Additionally, MSEs face hazardous work environments.\nWubet and Mmopelwa (2020) projected that MSEs employed between 17 and 27% population, approximately double the employment of large-scale enterprises and the public sector, based on a review of national surveys (conducted in various regions of Africa). According to the (2017a), MSEs employ a third or more of Ethiopia\u2019s labor force. In Tigray, there are a total of 2548 MSEs, employing 26,000 people according to OECD statistics from 2017. According to Wubet and Mmopelwa (2020), the MSEs sector employs over 2.3 million people and accounts for nearly 14% of Ethiopia\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nAs a result, the function of MSEs in improving the sustainable livelihoods of rural populations in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region has been explored in this study. However, flourishing MSEs contribute to the national economy by reducing poverty through income generation, women empowerment, and job creation. It also contributes to GDP, pioneers of industrialization, and the main pillars of economic and structural transformation by promoting savings and capital accumulation (Gebremeskel, 2018; Meressa, 2020). In addition, Ethiopia\u2019s MSME sector has a variety of constraints that limit its rapid growth and development, lowering the value of its potential contribution to the economy and impeding women\u2019s economic empowerment (Mamo et\u00a0al., 2021)."

Quantitative and qualitative research approaches can be used symbolically to avoid the limitations of using a single approach, according to Abebe (2012), because quantitative and qualitative research methods are insufficient to address complex social and cultural phenomena when treated separately. Thus, the qualitative research approach was employed in order to analyze the statistics and test the theory by specifying a narrow hypothesis and collecting and analyzing the data to support or refute the hypothesis. On the other hand, the study employed the qualitative research approach to collect and analyze the data which were obtained through in-depth interviews with key informants. It also focused on group discussion participants regarding the perception of the issues or factors related to the sustainability of the rural portable water supply system.\nIn this study, concurrent mixed research designs were employed because both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed at the same time. According to Zemenu (2012), concurrent triangulation designs collect and analyze quantitative and qualitative data at the same time. In order to ensure the validity of the qualitative data collected from the field, a method of triangulation that involves focus group discussions, key\n1 3\ninformant interviews, and observations has been administered consistently.

In order to determine the sample size for this study, the formula suggested by Yamane Taro (1967) was used. Accordingly, the sample size which is based on a 95% confidence level and P = 0.05 is determined as follows:\nwhere n is the required sample size, N is the number of households (i.e., 2548), and e is the desired precision (i.e., estimated error = 5%). The sample sizes were taken from each sample sector proportional to their total number of operators. The total households selected for this study were 346 operators residing in five selected sectors. To represent the MSE population by the above sample size, a two-stage sampling procedure was applied. First, the overall sample size (346) was divided among MSE sectors proportionally. Second, once the sample size share of each sector was determined, systematic random sampling technique was applied to extract the actual data from the respondents (Table\u00a02).\nAs stated above, the operators/respondents were first selected using stratified random sampling followed by the systematic random sampling method. Since the general setting of the sectors is heterogeneous, the sample size is thought to be representative."

In addition, to analyze the statistics, methods such as paired T-test, ANOVA, and linear regression were used, and the significance among variables was taken from these instruments.\nn = N\n1 + N(e) 2 =\n2548\n1 + 2548(0.5) 2 = 346\n1 3"

            "text": "Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of MSE operators were taken from the questionnaire. A total of 346 operators from five different MSE sectors were considered in order to achieve the main objectives of the study. The demographic characteristics such as gender, age, level of education, marital status, and family size were discussed.\nAccording to the survey results, the majority of entrepreneurs were male, and only 40.46% were females. The involvement of females seems less than males. The results indicated that the involvement of females in MSEs was below the regional range in which around 52% of MSEs were owned by females (Tigray Regional State Bureau of Trade, Industry, and Transport, 2008).\nAccording to the results, most MSE operators were found in the economically active working category (i.e., 60.12% of the respondents were in 18\u201330\u00a0 years age group) that contribute significantly to the working force of the locality. This situation will improve livelihoods and reduce the unemployed youth age. The age structure reflects the nature of the underlying company (i.e., challenges and limited access to equipment and machinery), which does not often allow the elderly to engage in activities as freely as their younger counterparts. The information gained from discussions between the concerned officials also indicated some instances in which very elderly people participated in different MSE sectors.\nThe relationship between owners\u2019 educational achievements and company growth exists in the empirical sense. According to Zafar et\u00a0al. (2016), secondary education has no substantial influence on the company\u2019s growth. A similar study, on the other hand, shows that owners with a better educational background tend to be more efficient and that formal education allows them to enhance their production, management, and marketing skills. Zafar et\u00a0al. (2016) explained that the overall level of education and education of small-scale owners in developing countries dictates firm development. Furthermore, according to Fufa (2015), higher education improves the firm\u2019s performance as well as external possibilities such as employment prospects. Low education levels and occupational training strongly influenced the chance of becoming an entrepreneur rather than an employee. According to ILO (2003) report, 90% of micro-enterprise owners and 88% of small enterprise owners had a formal education, with 72% and 66% receiving primary and secondary education, respectively. In general, the respondents in this study were women entrepreneurs, many of whom had better levels of education who were trying to manage or learn how to do business.\nBased on the findings shown in Fig.\u00a0 3, most sampled operators (48.55%) attended high school as the highest level of education, while the lowest rank was related to the first degree of education (26.882%). The level of education for the rest of the participants was 5\u20138 grade (18.73%), diploma (5.67%), 1\u20134 grade (8.092%), read and write only (6.64%), and illiterate (4.91%). This suggested that many MSEs lacked sufficient educational and technical background to generate income, and few college graduates were engaged in the MSE sector.\nAccording to Table\u00a03, the majority (46%) of the respondents were married. According to Fielden et\u00a0al. (2000), there is a significant link between marital status and company success. Because of the social, financial, and psychological support, as well as family responsibility and commitments, married men and women worked harder and\n1 3\nperformed better in business management than single and divorced individuals. In contrast, Rastogi et\u00a0 al. (2019) discovered a substantial inverse relation between marital status and professional achievement. According to Yaghi (2016), managers who are married women in the Middle Eastern (Arab) context deal more with social and family responsibilities after marriage, which has an influence on their business.\nFamily size is one of the main characteristics of households that determine household participation in different social and economic activities (Degefa et\u00a0 al., 2017). A large productive family generates and enhances household income, and this, in turn, enables the family members to be involved in MSE. Moreover, having a large family may indicate that the household has enough labor supply to participate in different income generating activities. The average household size in Ethiopia, based on the recent government population and housing survey, was 4.8 persons (CSA, 2007). Hadis and Ali (2018) assessed micro- and small enterprises in Ethiopia. According to the survey, significant business entrepreneurs have a larger number of families. In the sector, between 36 and 41% of the entrepreneurs had 2\u20135 and 4\u20136 individuals per family head, respectively. They stated that a large family would have an excellent chance of owning the firm.\nThe average family size observed in the study area was 4.67 below the range of what has been shown in earlier studies in Ethiopia (Table\u00a04).\n1 3\nAccording to the survey, 190 entrepreneurs (54.9%) used their personal savings as the main source of start-up capital, 85 (24.6%) took loans from micro-finance institutions, 58 (16.8%) borrowed from friends and relatives, and 13 (3.8%) obtained bank loans.\nAs clearly indicated in Table\u00a06, lack of capital is the major and primary problem that MSEs face. In addition, regarding the source of start-up capital, enterprises that took capital from banks and financial institutions were low compared with those that use informal sources. Respondents also said that if possible, they preferred to start the business by their own savings, and they believed that it is easy to start a business by borrowing from relatives and friends. This means that banks do not provide start-up capital due to lack of collateral, and MSEs do not have organized financial statements. Furthermore, members lack the confidence to take loans from financial institutions. Therefore, operators finance their business by their own capital to create confidence, especially at the start-up. The findings are consistent with Fufa (2015), which examined the growth determinants of MSE in Ethiopia. According to the findings of this study, finance is one of the most important resources in every business. This study examined the factors affecting the growth of MSE from profitability perspective on Nekemte. According to the findings, many MSE operators fail to provide a clear business strategy and project proposal for loan processing because they are less educated. This demonstrates that MSE operators in the study area have difficulty obtaining loans from MFIs due to the MFI system\u2019s time-consuming procedures and collateral requirements. The findings of the study were similarly in line with those of Cabral and Mata (2003) and Elston (2002), which found that a lack of financial resources slows a company\u2019s expansion to its optimal size."

            "text": "Tables\u00a04 and 5 indicates that the amount of initial capital of MSEs to start their business ranges from 1000 to 40,000 birr. Nonetheless, the initial capital of most MSEs (40.2%) was between 1000 and 5000 birr. The initial capital of other enterprises (39%) was between 5001 and 10,000 birr. Comparing the sectors, there is no major difference among them. The initial capital of the majority of sectors was between 1000 and 5000 birr, 4.9% of which was for manufacturing, 13.3% for trade, 6.1% for urban agriculture, 13.3% for service, and 2.6% for construction. Next to 5001\u201310,000 birr, most respondents of different sectors had the initial capital of 10,001\u201330,000 birr and shared 5.8% for manufacturing, 15.9% for trade, 6.9% for urban agriculture, 7.8% for service, and 2.6% for construction.\nIt is very difficult to obtain accurate information about the current capital compared with the initial capital. This is because of the fear of taxes, the fear of new competitors, and sociocultural problems. Despite the researcher showing them an identity card and other\n1 3\nsupporting documentation, the participants are reluctant to reveal the truth. Micro-companies are those with capital stocks of up to 20 000 birr, as mentioned in the last chapter. Such companies in Ethiopia take the majority. The total capital of the majority of companies is between 10,000 and 20,000 birr according to a researchers\u2019 survey (54.6%). The majority of MSE operators are therefore at the expected level of capital in the micro- and small sectors.\nIn accordance with the current capital, the initial capital of the MSEs varies considerably in the amount of capital invested. Thus, the initial capital of most MSEs (40.2%) was between 1000 and 100,000 birr. However, according to Table\u00a06, the current capital of most MSEs (90.2%) is above 10,000 birr.\nAccording to these findings, we can conclude that MSEs contributed to economic growth, employment formation, and income generation for the local community. MSEs, in fact, play a critical role in job creation and income generation. Because they provide jobs and give possibilities for low-income individuals to earn money, these MESs are more effective in the national economy. MSEs encourage entrepreneurship and protect the economy from economic crises including low per capita income, poverty, and rural unemployment."

This indicates that the variables usually had a clear and negative relationship. The study showed that R-square was 0.04. This value implies that 0.4% of the difference in the increased revenue of Emba Alaje Wereda operators can be explained by the independent variables (households of micro- and small business operators) (Table\u00a07).\nThe unstandardized coefficients for the predictor variables and the unstandardized detection code under column B of Table\u00a08 (Model 1) provide us with the coefficients of independent variables (Yi = \u03b1 + \u03b2Xi). The beta values show the direction of the relation. The essence of the relationship is indicated by a positive or negative symbol. Therefore, MSE operators\u2019 households are negatively linked to beta (\u2212 0.063). The statistical meaning of the relationship is indicated in the third column. Therefore, the regression model is likely to be 0.000 and thus a false predictor and is an acceptable model to display the\n1 3\nrelationship between variables. Overall, a p-value of less than 0.05 is recommended as it represents a high degree of trust.\nThere is a strong negative relationship between the household size of micro- and small enterprises\u2019 operators and entrepreneurs\u2019 income saving at 95% level of significance. This implies that an increase in the scored income of the entrepreneurs depends to a large extent on the household size of MSE operators. In other words, for a unit increase in the household size of MSE operators, there was a decline in income saving. In accordance with the above results, MSEs with large household sizes were generally getting less income saving compared with MSEs with smaller household sizes. In other words, the large household size of MSE operators saved less compared to MSE operators with a large number of households. This ensures the alternative hypothesis."

Regarding this issue, the head of the MSEs office stated that nowadays, infrastructural facilities, especially telephone service and transportation, are supplied at a low cost, but there is some interruption of electric power. Therefore, due to the increasing demand for infrastructural facilities (i.e., electricity, water, telephone, and transportation) and the difficulty to distribute them, there may be problems in access to water and electricity.

The subject MSMEs \u201cSmall Businesses, Big Impact\u02ee emphasizes the relevance of MSMEs in achieving sustainable development (Kamal-Chaoui, 2017).\nMSMEs employ people directly in their institutions to achieve goals such as Poverty Alleviation (Goal 1), Gender Equality (Goal 5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (Goal\n1 3\n8) and Industry Innovation and Infrastructure (Goal 9) and Reduced Inequalities (Goal 10) (Verma & Nema, 2019). MSEs help achieve certain goals through their specific operational efficiency including Zero hunger (goal 2), Affordable and Clean Energy (Goal 7), Responsible Consumption and Production (Goal 12) and Partnership for Goals (Goal 17). MSMEs also contribute to SDGs by performing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities in various forms to the goals of Good health and well-being (Goal 3), Quality Education (Goal 4), and building Sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11) (Orchard, 2017).\nHence, MSE is one of the sectors with the most potential to influence the advancement of most SDGs. MSEs are an important player in this effort because of their operational flexibility and variety. If MSEs prosper in the coming years, it will undoubtedly aid in the creation of more jobs, poverty alleviation, regional imbalance reduction, gender equality promotion, etc., so contributing significantly to the achievement of the SDGs.

            "text": "The empirical results of this study explained that micro- and small-scale businesses can contribute significantly to the boosting of income generation for marginalized people which results in poverty reduction and economic growth. On the other hand, MSEs encountered different determinant factors. This study attempted to address an important issue in the contribution of MSEs to community livelihood through the role of financial capitals in income generation, economic growth, and sustainable community development. The main implication of the current study is that the MSEs generate income and employment opportunities which are more influential than other sectors. If MSEs are properly managed and adequate intervention approaches are established, additional capacity is still available to further increase the existing employment opportunities to alleviate poverty. In this respect, the findings showed that MSEs contributed to economic growth, employment formation, and income generation for the local community. Furthermore, in the face of economic problems such as low per capita income, poverty, and unemployment in rural regions, MSEs create a culture of entrepreneurship and a secure economy.\nThe current study\u2019s findings showed that there was a gender gap over participation in different MSE sectors. In addition, many sectors which can employ more people are still managed by men. This shows that the bodies involved, such as the MSE Development Offices, Bureau of Cooperatives, and Bureau of Works and Social Affairs, should join their hands and allow women to enter traditionally male-dominated sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and urban farming. Above all, greater efforts should be made to consider both female and male-owned businesses. Formal education and the performance of MSEs do not show a definitive relationship to one another. Previous studies have shown that colleges are closer to the operation of these MSEs. However, most entrepreneurs responded that they had attained secondary school education. Therefore, more work is needed to bring capacity to the next level and make its services accessible to the MSE.\nMSE operators should give training to their new partners since training and capacity building are vital to improve production, marketing, and profitability. Refresher training is also required for those who have already completed the course. MSE representatives frequently receive additional training, and those who receive it should pass it on to others\n1 3\nbecause they are all working for the same goal. The government has additional resources for MSEs that have yet to be utilized, and it can improve the quality of MSE operations in order to expand geographically and serve a larger community. As a result, the government should reduce political interest, increase socioeconomic development programs, and replace MSE operators and community leaders.\nMSE offices should provide periodic supportive supervision to assist and answer their questions on time. Furthermore, officers from Wereda MSEs\u2019 offices have been observed to be unmotivated to conduct monitoring and evaluation in a way that results in real changes for the operators and community.\nAnother important issue raised in this study was the factors challenging MSEs. Regarding these factors, the following points appear to be the determinant ones affecting MSEs before and during the start-up in the study area:\n\u2022 To meet the growing demand for MSE activities, physical infrastructural facilities are poorly created and increased. As a result, federal and regional governments, as well as some zonal and Wereda administrative units, should focus on improving and disseminating infrastructures such as roads, electricity, and pure water. Government and microand small business leaders should expect to put in a lot of effort to change the public\u2019s perception of the MSE sector. \u2022 The growth of MSEs in the study area necessitates a variety of improvements in general, as well as improvements in the working areas of operators in particular. Infrastructure (roads) is being neglected in some areas. The improvement of this vital infrastructural equipment should be facilitated by governmental and non-governmental organizations to equalize demand and supply. \u2022 Enterprises should be structured so that they may obtain raw materials from other firms in the manufacturing process, and the government should provide a favorable business environment in collaboration with society and other prospective groups. Furthermore, government support in establishing raw material sources and finding viable markets for such firms should be provided in order to create demand from outside of the towns. \u2022 The working environment has been discovered to have a significant positive impact on MSEs\u2019 growth. As a result, the MSEs development office, in collaboration with the municipality, should work to encourage MSEs to have their own working spaces and to provide them with spaces at reasonable rents.\nThis study also confirmed that these contributions are bringing massive changes. However, there was a question of scale and continuity. Improving the operators\u2019 capacity to increase their performance and productivity is therefore very important. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop continuous capacity-building programs to enhance the capacity of MSEs, particularly human capital, by anchoring them with relevant training institutions that meet the needs of MSEs. Different problems with varying degrees of influence on MSEs can be dealt with in different ways at different times, depending on the availability of resources and conditions in the operational environment. As a result, extensive study on each sector should be conducted on a regular basis in order to identify the primary spatial difficulties faced by MSEs. The government and other responsible entities should research future business circumstances and favorability in order to set up the business environment in such a way that it can continue to assist businesses in the long term. Overall, sustainability is described as fulfilling present demands without endangering the capacity of future generations to meet their own, and it is based on three pillars: economic, environmental, and social. According to this definition, in this study, only the role of economic\n1 3\nindicators in rural growth and development has been studied. The main reason for this was that at the time of this study, due to the outbreak of Covid-19, the civil war in Ethiopia, and lack of access to financial resources, it was not possible to study these indicators more comprehensively.\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors."
