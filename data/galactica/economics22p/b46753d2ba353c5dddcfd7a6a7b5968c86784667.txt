The transition to sustainable food systems is one of the main challenges facing national and international action plans. It is estimated that food services and lodging accommodation activities are under pressure in terms of resource consumption and waste generation, and several tools are required to monitor their ecological transition. The present research adopts a semi-systematic and critical review of the current trends in the food service and lodging accommodation industries on a global scale and investigates the real current environmental indicators adopted internationally that can help to assess ecological transition. This research tries to answer the subsequent questions: (i) how has the ecological transition in the food service industry been monitored? and (ii) how has the ecological transition in the lodging accommodation industry been monitored? Our study reviews 66 peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings included in Web of Science between 2015 and 2021. The results were analyzed according to content analysis and co-word analysis. Additionally, we provide a multidimensional measurement dashboard of empirical and theoretical indicators and distinguish between air, water, energy, waste, health, and economic scopes. In light of the co-word analysis, five research clusters were identified in the literature: “food cluster”, “water cluster”, “consumers cluster”, “corporate cluster”, and “energy cluster”. Overall, it emerges that food, water, and energy are the most impacted natural resources in tourism, and users and managers are the stakeholders who must be involved in active monitoring. 1. conclusions The ecological transition in the hospitality sector remains one of the main challenges towards sustainable development. The traditional way to do business, which involves a lack of sustainable practices, is beginning to be no longer acceptable by the decision makers and public authorities. As a consequence, representatives from the field should reconsider their “way of doing business”. The present research, through a semi-systematic literature review of 66 peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings included in Web of Science between 2015 and 2021, brings new details about the monitoring activities of the
transition to sustainable food services and lodging accommodation activities. Overall, the current review has identified five intervention clusters, namely (a) “food cluster”, (b) ”water cluster”, (c) “consumers cluster”, (d) “corporate cluster”, and (e) “energy cluster”. Each cluster refers to different areas of intervention and specific indicators, either of sustainability or circularity, in order to identify strategies for pursuing the SDGs and ecological transition. One of the conclusions of the study is that the natural resources that are most impacted within the tourism sector are food, water, and energy, and the main stakeholders to be actively monitored are the users (or consumers) and the managers. Besides, companies and consumers should develop a positive attitude toward the implementation of economic and environmentally friendly-blended performance, whereas researchers should investigate each stage of the supply chain, from raw material supply to consumer behavior. Although the selected papers represent a small sample for inference, such scientific research still provides useful quantitative data for understanding the main sustainability trends in the food service and lodging accommodation industries. As regards the limitations of the present research, one refers to the small number of peer-reviewed articles and proceedings that were investigated, explained by restricting the approach of the research to the food service industry and the lodging accommodation industries. Another limitation was the language criteria for inclusion. The present research contains only articles and proceedings published in English that are included in the WOS database while excluding books. To enlarge the research base, the authors intend to expand this research to other databases, like Scopus and Elsevier and also to include books and book chapters. Lastly, our research has a timespan between 2015–2021 and does not make a distinction between articles published before or during the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to the main purpose of the paper as being focused on monitoring the overall ecological transition of food services and lodging accommodation activities, setting a starting point for future research.
