"In conclusion, investigations into the interaction of bacteria with REEs need to continue. As we are using an increased amount of these elements in everyday devices, such as solar panels, batteries, and electric cars, we are by default introducing them into the environment at increased levels. This leads to greater interactions with microbes, and without fully understanding their impact we may be causing long term issues of which we are unaware. Our work has shown that bacteria do in fact have methods of directly interacting with REEs that may be related to siderophore activity. This is the first study of its kind and the first to identify metallophores which interact with REEs. As discussed, the majority of our isolates were members of Pseudomonas, a genus known to possess siderophores and metallophores. While we have discovered metallophore activity, the actual properties of the compound responsible for this remain unknown and one can only speculate on how it may function. In addition, the true levels of toxicity of these elements have yet to be studied beyond E. coli."
