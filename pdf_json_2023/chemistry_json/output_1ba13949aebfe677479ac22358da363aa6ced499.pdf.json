    "abstractText": "In this study, we considered some pesticides as active substances within formulations for the protection of plant-based food in the Republic of Serbia in silico, because these pesticides have not often been investigated in this way previously, and in an analytical way, because there are not very many available fast, cheap, and easy methods for their determination in real agricultural samples. Seven pesticides were detected in selected agricultural products (tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and grapes) using the QuEChERS methodology and HPLC-DAD. Standard curves for the investigated pesticides (chlorantraniliprole, methomyl, metalaxyl, thiacloprid, acetamiprid, emamectin benzoate, and cymoxanil) show good linearity, with R2 values from 0.9785 to 0.9996. The HPLC-DAD method is fast, and these pesticides can be determined in real spiked samples in less than 15 min. We further characterized the pesticides we found in food based on physicochemical properties and molecular descriptors to predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity (ADMET) of the compounds. We summarized the data supporting their effects on humans using various computational tools to determine their potential adverse effects. The results of our prediction study show that all of the selected pesticides considered in this study have good oral bioavailability, and those with high toxicity, therefore, could be harmful to human health. Chlorantraniliprole was shown in a molecular docking study as a good starting point for a new Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate.",

            "text": "Pesticides are a broad class of chemical compounds used to control pests and pathogens. Despite the benefits of their use, their continued application and release into various ecosystems have become a problem for humans and the environment [1]. Carbamate pesticides are widely used to protect fruits and vegetables from insects, fungi, plant diseases, and weeds. Due to their good properties, such as broad biological activity, low bioaccumulation potential, low mammalian toxicity, and relatively short life span, they are popularly used in agriculture and are better substitutes for organochlorines and organophosphates. However, the negative side of carbamate pesticides is their harmful effect on the central nervous system, as they can bind to the active sites of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [2\u20134]. The complexity of real samples usually requires their preparation to eliminate the effects of the matrix and increase the concentration of the analyte (pesticide). In previ-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8003. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24098003 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8003 2 of 16\nous studies, the following pretreatment methods were used for the extraction and concentration of the desired pesticides: microwave-accelerated selective Soxhlet extraction (MA-SSE) [5], single-drop microextraction (SDME) [6], dynamic microwave-assisted extraction online coupled with single drop microextraction (DMAE-SDME) [7], dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) [8], hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) [9], magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) [10], magnetic graphene solid-phase extractions (G-MNPs) [2], cloud-point extraction (CPE) [4], ultrasound-assisted surfactant-enhanced emulsification microextraction (UASEME) [11], quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe (QuEChERS) [12,13], and molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) [14]. The standard QuEChERS method is usually subjected to minor or major modifications. Samples with complex matrices, i.e., samples with a high lipid content and highly pigmented samples, require additional purifications by introducing a solid phase with a highly active adsorption surface, such as C18 and charcoal [15]. Lehotay et al. (2005, 2010) [16,17] modified the standard QuEChERS method for the extraction of unstable pesticides from fruit and vegetable samples by adding buffers. They achieved the desired pH by adding anhydrous sodium acetate during the extraction of the pesticides from the fruit and vegetable samples. Farina et al. (2017) [18] quantified 15 different pesticides in the leaves of leafy vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce, celery, spinach, and mustard). Another group of researchers conducted a study intending to determine pesticide residues in 120 vegetable samples (parsley, lettuce, and spinach) [19]. Andrade et al. (2015) [15] developed a very rapid method to quantify 57 pesticides in 58 tomato samples in only 13 min using liquid chromatography\u2013electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. They determined the following pesticides, among others: thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, cymoxanil, thiacloprid, and tebuconazole. Sinha et al. (2012) [13] improved the QuEChERS method for the extraction of 18 organophosphates from vegetable samples and quantified them using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. Among other carbamate pesticides, methomyl was also determined in the fruit samples. Moreno-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2013) [11] determined carbamate pesticides in wine samples, including methomyl and cymoxanil. The aim of this research was the in silico investigation of selected pesticides and their determination in agricultural products using QuEChERS methodology and HPLC-DAD. Inhibition capabilities of selected pesticides in silico against acetylcholine esterase of Mus muculus and Homo sapiens were checked. In this regard, this research is the continuation of our previous study [20]. To the best of our knowledge, nobody before us has performed such an analysis giving insight into the different toxicities of pesticides against M. musculus and H. sapiens. As some pesticides have been shown to be reversible inhibitors of acetylcholine esterase, they are used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, postoperative ileus, bladder distention, and glaucoma, as well as as an antidote to anticholinergic overdose [21]. Three approved drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) were docked into the binding site of donepezil in acetylcholine esterase of H. sapiens and experimentally determined pesticides (chlorantraniliprole, methomyl, metalaxyl, thiacloprid, acetamiprid, emamectin benzoate, and cymoxanil), and their binding abilities were compared. Recently, we screened natural compounds for candidate 5HT6 receptor antagonists against Alzheimer\u2019s disease [22]. The reason for using in silico approaches is the relatively lower cost and time factor compared to standard experimental approaches for ADMET profiling [23]. The amount and diversity of data obtained from experimental toxicity studies allowed the construction of truthful computational models for toxicological evaluation. They are recognized by the European Food Safety Association [24] and are nowadays constantly used in the evaluation of the toxicological effects of different pesticides on humans [25,26]. We use some of these computational tools in our study because they were developed for predicting the effects on humans. Therefore, early optimization in this process is very important.\nInt. J. Mol.

            "text": "Standard curves for the investigated pesticides (chlorantraniliprole, methomyl, metalaxyl, thiacloprid, acetamiprid, emamectin benzoate, and cymoxanil) show good linearity (Table 1).\n* The first calibration curve is related to the series of standard solutions used also for spiking real samples of cucumbers. The second calibration curve is related to the series of standard solutions also used for spiking real samples of grapes.\nThiacloprid, methomyl, metalaxyl, and chlorantraniliprole can be determined in less than 15 min in the tomato sample treated with the QuChERS kit for highly pigmented samples (P2) and without it (P1) (Figure S1). Retention times of selected pesticides are negligibly different in real spiked samples compared to standard solutions of the pesticides alone due to the matrix effect [27]. In P2, only thiacloprid was determined in the real sample without spiking. The concentration of chlorantraniliprole was 1.43 mg/kg, that of thiacloprid was 0.77 mg/kg, and methomyl was found to be present at a concentration of 0.85 mg/kg. Metalaxyl was not quantified because its quantity was below the limit of quantification. In sample P1, thiacloprid and metalaxyl could not be quantified, the concentration of methomyl was 0.96 mg/kg, and the concentration of chlorantraniliprole was 1.56 mg/kg. Thiacloprid ((Z)-3-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidenecyanamide) is effective against sucking and biting insects [28]. A matrix effect was observed in the determination of thiacloprid in green tea [28]. The treated tea samples have concentrations in the range of 0.04\u20132.55 mg/kg (fresh) and 0.04\u20131.23 mg/kg (dry) [28]. The conclusion was drawn based on the research that elevated temperatures can lead to the degradation of thiacloprid, which has been observed previously [29]. The initial deposition of thiacloprid in tomatoes in previously published studies was 0.16\u20130.29 mg/kg [30]. Several methods for the detection of thiacloprid in environmental and food samples have been shown to be as quite reliable (verified by the standard HPLC method), such as the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (ECL EIA), which was developed based on horseradish peroxidase [31]. Thiacloprid was determined along with other neonicotinoid pesticides in real samples, and methanol was also used as an extraction solvent, as in our study, which allows the complete removal of analytes from cartridges, and it was also found that the matrix effect depends on the type of sample [32]. Chlorantraniliprole is a second-generation anthranilic diamide insecticide that acts on insect ryanodine receptors and causes death due to the uncontrolled release of calcium ion stores in the muscle cells [33]. Methomyl residues after treating mint were determined using UPLC-MS, and a higher amount was found in the root (15.35\u201379.52 \u00b5g/kg) compared to the mixed leaves and stem (3.31\u201344.54 \u00b5g/kg) [34]. Quantification of methomyl in different samples was performed using HPLC, but with a one-step post-column derivatization reaction and a fluorescence detector [35]. In a recent study, methomyl was determined in a tomato fruit at levels ranging from 0.003 to 2.06 mg/kg [36]. Metalaxyl and its degradation products have been studied using lettuce\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8003 4 of 16\nand sunflower plants as examples in GC-MS and IR and using NMR [37]. Its quantification in some real samples (grapes) was performed using RP-HPLC UV-DAD, and the value found was 2 mg/kg [38]. GC-MS analysis was proved to be good for the determination of metalaxyl in strawberries [39]. HPLC-DAD was previously reported for the determination of metalaxyl in tomatoes [40]. The matrix effect in tomatoes was reduced in our study using QuEChERS [41]. As for the quantification of pesticide residues in real cucumber samples, the situation was worse than in the case of tomatoes. Among the three pesticides (cymoxanil, famoxadone, and thiamethoxam), only cymoxanil could be quantified in both samples (K1 and K2) (Figure S2). Thiamethoxam was detected in real samples spiked with pesticides, but its quantification was not possible because a standard curve could not be established. Famoxadone could not be detected in real samples spiked with pesticides, nor could a standard curve be established. The determined concentration of cymoxanil was higher in the K1 sample (1.25 mg/kg) than in the K2 sample (0.81 mg/kg). Grapes are widely chemically treated against pests, and there are a variety of compounds for this purpose (abamectin, cymoxanil, metalaxyl-M, pyraclostrobin, propiconazole, and tebuconazole). Of these pesticides in the UV range of 180\u2013400 nm, only cymoxanil was quantified in the spiked real samples of grapes examined (Figure S3). Unlike cucumber, cymoxanil was quantified in the real sample without the use of QuEChERS kits for highly pigmented substances (0.31 mg/kg). Cymoxanil was previously found in grape juices using QuEChERS and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry [42]. Pepper as a plant is treated with several pesticides: acetamiprid, boscalid, emamectin benzoate, metalaxyl, pendimethalin, and pyraclostrobin, and some of them were detected and quantified in the real samples spiked with the pesticides (PP1 and PP2). Emamectin (without the benzoate), due to dissociation in the aqueous medium, was detected and quantified only in sample PP1 (13.53 mg/kg) (Figure S4). Emamectin benzoate was previously detected in rice and rice-growing areas by means of UPLC/MS/MS [43], and in fruits and vegetables by means of LC-MS/MS [44]. Acetamiprid was detected and quantified in both real samples: PP1 (0.025 mg/kg) and PP2 (0.008 mg/kg) (Figure S4). Previously, it was determined in vegetables using the Indirect Competitive Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassay [45], in lettuce using a bioelectric cell biosensor-based system [46], and in sweet cherries (0.111\u20130.529 mg/kg) using the HPLC-UV DAD system [47]. A preliminary method has been developed for the rapid in situ determination of acetamiprid in fruits and vegetables using the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method based on the Au@AgNPs substrate [48]. The MRLs of selected pesticides in the investigated fruits and vegetables differ between the international standards. According to the EU standard, only the values found for pesticide residues of acetamiprid in peppers and metalaxyl in tomatoes are within the recommended values (0.3, and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively). The determined values of the remaining selected pesticides in the examined and not washed fruits and vegetables are outside the recommended values (cymoxanil in cucumbers 0.01 mg/kg, cymoxanil in grapes 0.01 mg/kg, emamectin-benzoate in peppers 0.02 mg/kg, chlorantraniliprole in tomatoes 0.6 mg/kg, methomyl in tomatoes 0.02 mg/kg, and thiacloprid in tomatoes 0.5 mg/kg)."

The global minimum of each pesticide was used for molecular docking. The global minimum energies and repeats of the studied structures are listed in Table 3. After optimization, the selected pesticides were subjected to molecular docking against acetylcholinesterase from Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, the sequences of which have an identity of 89.80% using BLASTP (Protein BLAST: search protein databases using a protein query (nih.gov)), and the values of Glide scores from molecular docking are given in Table 3. Acetylcholine esterase was chosen because of its involvement in numerous cholinergic pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the inactivation of which, induced by various inhibitors, leads to its accumulation, hyperstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and disrupted neurotransmission [21]. According to the performed molecular docking studies, the best binder for acetylcholinesterase from\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8003 6 of 16\nMus musculus is emamectin benzoate as emamectin, and the worst binder is metalaxyl. In the case of Homo sapiens acetylcholinesterase, the best binder is acetamiprid, and the worst binder is methomyl.\nInterestingly, the pesticides bind at the same site in Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. Acetamiprid has a common contact in M. musculus and H. sapiens: His 381. Leu 380 in M. musculus and Trp 385 and Gln 527 in H. sapiens are other contacts (Figure S5). Cymoxanil has two common contacts: Gln 527 and His 381, and additional contacts: Tyr 382 and Leu 380 in M. musculus, and Ala 528 in H. sapiens (Figure S6). Emamectin has two common contacts to both structures (Leu 386 and His 381), and additional contacts: Arg 525, Asp 400 in H. sapiens, and Gln 527, Tyr 382, and Arg 521 in M. musculus (Figure S7). Thiacloprid has two common contacts to both structures: Gln 527 and His 381, with the additional contact Phe 531 in M. musculus (Figure S8). Methomyl has two common contacts to both structures: His 381 and Leu 380, and additional contacts: Tyr 382, Arg 525 and Ala 528 in H. sapiens, and Phe 531 and Phe 535 in M. musculus (Figure S9). Metalaxyl has a common contact with both structures: Gln 527, and an additional contact in the case of M. musculus: His 381 (Figure S10). Chlorantraniliprole has three common contacts to both structures: Leu 380, His 381 and Gln 527, with one additional contact in the case of H. sapiens: Ala 528 (Figure S11)."

The crystal structure of donepezil with acetylcholine esterase from H. sapiens was used for our docking studies, bearing in mind its binding site from chain B including interactions with Ser 293, Trp 286 and Trp 86 [53]. Donepezil redocking provided a Glide score of \u22123.90 kcal/mol. Two other approved medicines for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (rivastigmine and galantamine) provided better results for galantamine (\u22125.38 kcal/mol) and worse results for rivastigmine (\u22122.94 kcal/mol).

Thiacloprid was found in the real sample of tomatoes without spiking. The HPLC-DAD method is fast because the pesticides can be determined in less than 15 min, and reliable because of the good linearity of standard curves. According to the EU standard, only the values found for pesticide residues of acetamiprid in peppers and metalaxyl in tomatoes are within the recommended values (0.3, and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively). AQVN/EIIP was shown as a good prediction tool for the behaviour of selected pesticides against acetylcholine esterase. These selected pesticides against acetylcholine esterase in silico show the same region for binding both in Mus musculus and Homo sapiens with some differences. Based on the values for acute oral LD50 obtained for rats (mg/kg) regarding pesticides, only chlorantraniliprole stands out as a potential candidate (>5000) for further studies regarding the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and less toxic modifications could potentially be designed in the future.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24098003/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.A., J.M. and S.G.; methodology, B.A., J.M. and S.G.; formal analysis, S.P., B.A., I.Z. and J.M.; investigation, S.P., B.A., I.Z. and J.M.; resources, B.A., J.M., S.G., R.\u00d0.-P. and G.S.; data curation, S.P., B.A. and J.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.P., B.A. and J.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.P., B.A., I.Z., J.M., S.G., M.M., R.\u00d0.-P. and G.S.; visualization, B.A.; supervision, B.A., J.M., S.G. and G.S.
