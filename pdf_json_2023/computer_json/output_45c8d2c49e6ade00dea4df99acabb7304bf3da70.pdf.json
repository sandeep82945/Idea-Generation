    "abstractText": "Telegram is one of the most popular instant messaging apps in today\u2019s digital age. In addition to providing a private messaging service, Telegram, with its channels, represents a valid medium for rapidly broadcasting content to a large audience (e.g., COVID-19 announcements), but, unfortunately, also for disseminating radical ideologies and coordinating attacks (e.g., Capitol Hill riot). This paper presents the TGDataset, a new dataset that includes 120,979 Telegram channels and over 400 million messages, making it the largest collection of Telegram channels to the best of our knowledge. After a brief introduction to the data collection process, we analyze the languages spoken within our dataset and the topic covered by English channels. Finally, we discuss some use cases in which our dataset can be extremely useful to understand better the Telegram ecosystem, as well as to study the diffusion of questionable news. In addition to the raw dataset, we released the scripts we used to analyze the dataset and the list of channels belonging to the network of a new conspiracy theory called Sabmyk.",

Yet, as is common with platforms prioritizing user privacy, its privacy-focused approach led malicious users to join the platform and use it for illegal activities, bringing Telegram to the center of several controversial incidents in recent years. Terrorists in Indonesia leveraged Telegram to spread radical ideologies and issue directives to conduct violent attacks [1]. Neo-Nazis promoted their ideologies through Telegram channels and groups [4]. Crypto investors utilize Telegram channels to coordinate large-scale market manipulations, such as pump and dump schemes [39]. Furthermore, channels featuring revenge porn [6] and child pornography [3] are unfortunately not uncommon. This highlights the complex nature of Telegram and its largely unknown darker aspects that deserve investigation.\nIn this study, we introduce the TGDataset, a collection of public Telegram channels of over 120,000 channels and 400 million messages, that we publicly release [38]. To the best of our knowledge, the TGDataset is the largest publicly available collection of Telegram channels. We begin by providing an overview of the dataset, quantifying the main features of the TGDataset. Then, we perform some vertical analysis, detecting the languages that are used the most in the channels and the topics covered by the English channels. Among many legitimate topics, we find channels publicizing porn, carding, violence, hacking, and white supremacy content. Studying the creation date of the channels to understand the evolution of Telegram over time, we find consistent growth in the creation of channels on Telegram, with Russian channels taking the lead until the ban in 2018, followed by English channels surpassing them in 2021, likely due to the policy changes in WhatsApp and the resulting user migration.\nWhile previous datasets on Telegram focused on specific research objectives that limited their scope to channels related to a particular language, country, or topic, our dataset provides a more comprehensive representation of Telegram. Indeed, it includes channels dealing with various subjects in different languages. This aspect makes the TGDataset an excellent starting point for studying several phenomena occurring on Telegram. One of these phenomena concerns the political leaning of the platform and the sharing of questionable content, a subject widely explored on other Online Social Networks (OSNs) but not on Telegram. Moreover, the dataset includes numerous channels disseminating conspiracy theories, including newer ones (i.e., Sabmyk). Furthermore, the massive presence of channels running borderline activities (i.e., carding), calling to violence, or promoting Nazi ideologies suggests that the TGDataset represents a valuable resource for researchers willing to investigate and shed light on this dark side of Telegram. ar X\niv :2\n30 3.\n05 34\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C Y\n] 9\nM ar\n2 02\n3"

            "text": "Started in 2013, Telegram is now a popular instant messaging platform, with more than 500 million active users in 2021 [9]. Telegram allows users to post content such as text messages, images, audio, stickers, videos, and files weighing up to 2 GB. In addition to private chats (one-to-one communication), Telegram provides two other solutions to communicate: Groups and Channels.\nGroups: Designed for many-to-many messaging, groups allow up to 200,000 members to communicate with each other by posting content. Groups are identified by a unique username and have a description and a title. They can be public (i.e., can be found with Telegram search, and every user can read its content and join the group) or private (i.e., only members can see the posts, and users need an invite link to join it). Besides, a group presents a list of its members which, if the group is public, is visible to anyone (even non-members).\nChannels: They offer one-to-many communication. Thus, differently from groups where every member can post messages, in channels, only administrators can publish posts. Channels have a unique username, a title, a description, and can be private or public. Fig. 1 presents the information displayed by a channel. Contrary to groups, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers and does not display any users\u2019 information (i.e., nicknames) other than the number of its subscribers. Thanks to these features, Telegram channels have become popular for disseminating content to a large audience. Indeed, several public figures and companies started using official Telegram channels to share news and updates [40]. Nonetheless, this tendency caused an increase in the number of\nchannels on the platform seeking to impersonate official channels or sell counterfeit products and services.\nScam and Verified mark: To tackle this issue, Telegram has implemented the verified and the scam marks. The verified mark requires that channels, groups, and bots prove their verified status on at least two social media platforms(e.g., TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) [11]. In contrast, the scam status is assigned to channels and groups reported for fraud by multiple users [49].\nThe forwardmechanism: Although private chats, groups, and channels can not communicate directly among them, they are not isolated but may be linked throughmessage forwarding. Leveraging this feature, users and channels can forwardmessages to other users, groups, or channels displaying the post\u2019s original author. Fig. 1 shows an example of message forwarding, where the admin of \"Channel A\" (Fig. 1 (C)) forwards in his channel a message from the Bloomberg\u2019s channel. The message in the red square of Fig. 1 (B)) is the original message, while the one in the red square of Fig. 1 (C) is the forwarded message. As shown in Fig. 1, the forwarded message displays the name of the original channel of the post, which, if clicked, leads to that channel."

For example, [28] only includes Iranian channels, and [33] only contains 151 channels related to QAnon. Instead, the PushShift dataset [18], to the best of our knowledge, the only other public dataset, contains 27,800 channels\nfocusing on channels discussing right-wing extremism and cryptocurrency. In contrast, our dataset aims to provide a global snapshot of the Telegram ecosystem. To achieve this goal, we require a dataset that provides an up-to-date representation of Telegram and encompasses a broad range of popular and interconnected channels. This is the motivation behind the creation of the TGDataset."

            "text": "To build the TGDataset, we use a snowball approach as previously done in [18]. We begin with a set of seed channels related to various topics and then extend our dataset by including the source channel of each forwarded message. Fig. 2 represents the flow diagram we use to collect the data. To determine the seed channels (Step 1 in Fig. 2), we utilize Tgstat [8], a popular freemium service that indexes over 150,000 Telegram channels and gathers statistics about them. Tgstat provides information for each channel, such as the subscriber count, topic category, growth rate, and language. Among the other metrics, Tgstat lists the top 100 channels by the number of subscribers. From this rank, we retrieve all the categories these channels belong to, finding the following 18 categories:: Sales, Humor and entertainment, News and Mass media, Video & Movies, Business & Startups, Cryptocurrencies, Politics, Technologies, Sport, Marketing, Economics, Games, Religion, Software and Applications, Lifehacks, Fashion & Beauty, Medicine, and Adults. Finally, we selected the ten most popular channels from each category as the seed channels according to their subscriber count. With this approach, we collect 180 seed channels. Next, for each seed channel, we proceed with downloading all its messages by leveraging the Telethon APIs [10] (Step (2)), an open-source Python tool that provides access to the official Telegram APIs. Specifically, each call to download messages from a channel is performed five seconds after the previous one to avoid flooding the Telegram service. Once retrieved the data about the channel, we proceed with the data extraction (Step (3)): in particular, we retain all the information obtained by Telegram API, excluding media files such as images, videos, or PDFs. The reason behind this decision is to avoid storing copyrighted or illegal content. Anyway, even for media-based messages, we memorize some information such as file format, title, author, and ID. Next, we store the collected data (Step (4)) and parse the messages of the channel to identify forwarded messages and their original authors (Step 5). If the author represents a channel that we have never seen, then the channel is added to the list of new channels. Conversely, if the author is a user or represents a group, we ignore the author\nof the forwarded message. To iteratively expand the TGDataset, we repeat the above procedure of channel discovery (Steps 2, 3, 4, and 5) using the newly found channels as new seeds. We stopped the iteration process on July 31, 2022. Finally, to align our dataset, for each discovered channel, we download all the missing messages until July 31, 2022. In particular, for each channel, we store the following information as listed in Tab. 1: title and if it is marked as verified or scam(item 1 in Fig. 1 (A)), subscriber count (item 2), description (item 3), username (item 4), ID, and creation date. For the messages, we retain the author (the name of the channel), timestamp, and, in the case of forwarded messages, original posting date and original channel."

To ease the retrieval of single channels from the dataset, we store them in alphabetical order. In addition, each file\u2019s name describes the index of the channels it contains. Given the large dimension of the dataset, even if compressed (approx. 71GB), we divided the dataset into four parts. In this way, it is possible to download and explore also a single portion of the dataset. All the information is encoded in JSON format so that the data can be easily parsed and manipulated with most programming languages.\nWe also released on a public GitHub repository [38] Python scripts that can load the data into a MongoDB [17] database, as well as scripts that show how to perform basic queries on the database (such as inserting new channels or retrieving channels by username\nor ID). Furthermore, these scripts can also replicate some of the analysis that we performed in this work, including Language Detection of the channels (Section 4.1) and Topic Modeling (Section 4.2).\nFinally, we released as CSV files the list of channels belonging to the Sabmyk network (Sec. 5.2), the list of channels annotated with the detected writing language, and the one containing the mapping of inferred topics."

The dataset has a total size of about 460 GB and includes 498,320,597 messages and 120,979 unique channels. Out of these channels, 654 (0.54%) have verified status, while 183 (0.15%) are flagged as scam channels. For the purpose of clarity, we will refer to the remaining 120,142 channels, which are neither scams nor verified, as standard channels.\nTo provide a general characterization of the channels contained in the TGDataset, in Fig. 3, we show the CDFs of the number of subscribers, posts published, and the ratio of forwarded messages for verified, scam, and standard channels. As shown in Fig. 3(a), verified channels (green line), in general, have more subscribers than scam (dashed orange line) and standard channels (dotted blue line). Indeed, the verified channels with more than 1,000 subscribers are 98.32%, while the scams and standard are 68.85% and 38.11%, respectively. Concerning the number of messages published, Fig. 3(b) suggests that verified channels tend to post more content than scams and standard ones. The standard channels with at least 1,000 messages are 57.16%, those verified are 83.79%, and the scams are 50.82%. Finally, we report the extent of use of the forwarding function among channels of the TGDataset. Fig. 3(c) reveals message forwarding is more prevalent in standard and scam channels. The standard channels with at least a 0.1 ratio of their messages that are forwarded are 33.5%, whereas the scams and the verified ones are 32.24% and 13.15%, respectively."

This study gives hints about the popularity of the Telegram platform in different regions of the world. To automatically retrieve the language used in a channel, we leverage Language Detection [51], a language detection library implemented in Java by Google with over 99% of precision for 53 languages. To get meaningful results dealing with text-based messages, first, the text has to be normalized and polished from useless information [56]. Hence, we applied the following preprocessing steps:\n\u2022 Deletion of messages shorter than 15 characters: we do not consider messages less than 15 characters long as they do not ensure a high enough accuracy [16].\n\u2022 Tokenization: we use the RegexpTokenizer: developed by NLTK [7] to split the text-based messages into tokens (i.e., single words, punctuation symbols). \u2022 Deletion of numbers and emoji: we remove all the numbers and emoji in the documents as they do not provide information about the spoken language. \u2022 Deletion of references and citations: as usernames typically do not help to identify the language used, we discard both references and mentions to groups, channels, or users.\nWe assign a channel to a specific language only if over 50% of its messages are written in that language. Otherwise, we will not associate a language with that channel. At the end of the analysis, we find that the five most spoken languages in our dataset are Russian with 42,983 channels (35.52%), English with 19,768 channels (16.34%), Farsi with 16,779 channels (13.86%), German 4,950 (4.09%), and Arabic with 2,523 (2.08%). Of particular interest is the strong presence of the Russian and Farsi channels, which likely reflects the popularity of Telegram in Russia and Iran, despite Russia\u2019s government banned Telegram from 2018 to 2020 [5], and it is still banned in Iran [15]. Although Iran banned Telegram on 30 April 2018 [2], in our dataset, there are 4,635 out of 16,779 (27.62%) channels in Farsi created after the date of the ban. Instead, looking at the last activity of Farsi\u2019s channels, we find that more than 66.53% (11,164) channels continued to operate after the ban. Regarding Russian channels, as shown in section Sec. 4.3, they continue to appear also after the ban of 2018."

            "heading": "4.2 Topic modeling",
            "text": "In this subsection, we investigate the topics covered by the channels in our TGDataset using Topic Modeling [31]. This is a data mining tool that allows finding a brief description of the topic addressed by the messages of a channel. For this analysis, we consider only channels that post English content. Thus, we use as input to the topic modeling 19,768 channels (16.34% of our dataset). As in language detection, a preprocessing phase is necessary. In addition to the deletion of numbers, deletion of emoji, and normalization, the preprocessing involves the following operations:\n\u2022 Deletion of words of one or two characters: we do not consider words of one or two characters since they are very common in messages (e.g. y, no, ok) and do not provide information about the topic. \u2022 Lemmatization: we use the en_core_web_smmodel developed by spaCy [32] to reduce inflected words to their lemma to consider a word in different forms as a unique term. \u2022 Lowercase normalization and stopwords deletion: we leverage the English list of stopwords provided by NLTK [48] to discard them since they are words (i.e., articles or prepositions) commonly used in language but do not carry significant meaning to a sentence [50].\nTo discover the latent topics addressed within the channels, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [19] as the Topic Modeling algorithm. LDA needs as input the number of topics, so we used the UMass measure [45] to select the optimal one. In particular, the higher the coherence of the words representing topics, the closer to 0 the value of UMass. In our case, we calculate the best UMass value reached by selecting the number of topics from 10 to 30.\nThe best UMass value (-0.69) is obtained with 13 topics. Tab. 2 shows the inferred topics and the top 10 keywords for each of them. Once identified the topics, we group the channels according to them using LDA. Tab. 4 reports the topics discovered in the TGDataset and the number of channels associated with each topic. As we can see, the emerged topics are quite different from those covered by the seed channels (see Sec. 3). Indeed, some disappeared (e.g., Sport, Marketing), while other interesting topics came up. One of these is related to carding. Carding is the practice of selling full details of stolen credit cards or selling prepaid cards or other goods purchased with them. Similarly to what happens in dark web forums [35], carders (the people who own the stolen credit cards)\nuse Telegram channels to place gift cards or goods for sale. In the TGDataset, we find 1,489 channels (7.53% of the English part of the dataset) offering this service. In particular, the presence of 45 carding channels marked as a scam by Telegram suggests that some of them do not deliver the offered service.\nAnother unusual cluster containing 989 channels (5% of English channels) is the one about extremists and radicals. Here, several channels promote white supremacy, as well as other Nazi ideologies and conspiracies against the white race (the title of one of these channels is White Genocide Immigration Anti-White Agenda). Interestingly, there are four channels in this category having the verified status. One channel (\"ISIS Watch\") just publishes daily updates on banned terrorist content. Instead, the other three channels are related to official news agencies of the Russian government and are no longer accessible on Telegram. Moreover, some of their messages we collected are obscured by the platform. To investigate this aspect deeper, we analyze the messages obscured by Telegram as they incited violence, published illegal pornographic content, or shared content protected by copyright. In this case, Telegram replaced some or all of the channel\u2019s messages with text explaining the reasons for obfuscation. Interestingly, the channel itself and the metadata (e.g., the posting date) related to the original messages are still available.\nAs shown in Tab. 3, the service message most used by Telegram to obscure a post is the one about the violation of Telegram\u2019s Terms of Service (428,793 messages). Follow the one about the spread of pornographic content (263,643 messages), the violation of local laws (145,448 messages), and copyright infringement (48,402 messages).\nFinally, we find that the other topics are more aligned with the ones covered by the seed channel of the TGDataset."

In particular, the blue line represents the overall number of channels created on a certain date, while the green and the orange lines the number of Russian and English channels, respectively. As we can see, the number of channels created is steadily increasing, indicating that the Telegram platform is becoming more popular daily. Indeed, also\nmany governments choose to use Telegram channels to communicate information regarding COVID-19 [40]. Until the beginning of 2018, the growth of channels is led by Russian-speaking users. However, in the first months of 2018, it is possible to note a sudden drop in daily created channels, likely due to the Russian ban of Telegram (green dot in Fig. 4). Nonetheless, Russian channels, even if at a lower rate, continue to appear every day. Finally, in the first months of 2021, there was an abrupt increase of English-language spoken channels that overtook the Russian ones for the first time in Telegram history, accordingly to our data. This event coincides\nwith the change of WhatsApp\u2019s privacy policy (azure dot in Fig. 4) and the migration of many users from WhatsApp to Telegram [13]."

            "text": "Previous studies show that the presence of moderation in OSNs (e.g., Twitter) produces a significant reduction of questionable content, with respect to not moderated OSNs (e.g., Gab) [23], and that the information diffusion is biased by the political leaning of the community [21]. These studies quantify very well these phenomena in OSNs (e.g., Twitter, Gab, Facebook, Reddit). However, very little is known about the loosely moderated Telegram platform. Thus, we use the TGDatset to perform the first high-level investigation on Telegram. To this end, as done in [23, 24], we leverage Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) [43], an independent fact-checking organization that rates the bias of news outlets. In particular, MBFC classifies the political bias of news outlets with one of the following labels: Extreme Left, Left, Left-Center, Least-Biased, Right-Center, Right, Extreme Right. Additionally, MBFC provides a second label to quantify the reliability of the outlet, categorizing outlets as Reliable and Questionable.\nFor each English channel in the TGDataset, we label the links it contains according to the categorization of MBFC. Then, we assign to the channel the label that appears most frequently among its categorized links. In this way, we are able to classify 9,045 channels out of 19,768: the remaining channels did not share news or had outlet sources not present in MBFC. Aggregating the channels of the left area (Left-Center, Left, Extreme Left) and those of the right area (Extreme Right, Right, Right-Center), we get that the number of channels is mostly balanced, with 4,491 channels sharing right-leaning news and 3,900 left-leaning news. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that we find 2,748 channels spreading news related to the extreme right and no channel on the extreme left. Looking at the channels of the four topics that contain the most categorized channels (World news, US news, Religion, and Covid), we find that the World news topic is the one most biased towards the left (associated with more than 60% of the outlets). Concerning the channels belonging to the Religion topic, they are almost divided equally between left and right. Finally, we find the channels of the topics of US news and Covid are mostly biased towards the right. In particular, while on the topic of World news very few channels belong to the extreme right (76), we find they are predominant in the topics of Religion, with 590 channels, of US news, with 1,144\nchannels, and of Covid, with 601 channels. Moreover, these three topics are those where we find a higher presence of news sources questionable, with 1,353 for Religion, 2,320 for the US news, and 1,277 for Covid. Using the details about the classification of MBFC, we investigate the reason these outlets are classified as questionable. Surprisingly, we discover that 55% of Religions, 80% of US news, and 85% of Covid questionable channels share contents of news outlets that MBFC associates with conspiracy theories.\nThis first high-level study shows that, in Telegram, there are many channels spreading news from unreliable news outlets. Thus, we believe that the TGDatset could be a useful resource for researchers to better understand the techniques used for the diffusion of misinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories."

In this subsection, we attempt to identify them through community detection. A community in a graph is a subset of nodes that are densely connected to each other and weakly connected to nodes in other communities.\nFor this study, we represent our dataset as a directed graph \ud835\udc3a = (\ud835\udc49 , \ud835\udc38) in which nodes in \ud835\udc49 are the channels, and edge \ud835\udc62 \u2192 \ud835\udc63 in \ud835\udc38 represents the presence in channel \ud835\udc62 of a message originally posted in \ud835\udc63 and forwarded to \ud835\udc62 by the admin of channel \ud835\udc62. Since the users of channel \ud835\udc62 can navigate the forwarded message and land on channel \ud835\udc63 , the edge represents in a natural way the possible flow through channels of users following forwarded messages. To build and analyze our graph, we use the NetworkX library [27].\nThen, we use the Leiden algorithm [54], an algorithm for community detection that improves the Louvain algorithm [26]. This approach finds a partition with 311 communities, 47 of which with more than one node. One of the communities, which consists of 236 channels and where English is the common language, has the peculiarity that all posts and all messages forwarded from one channel to the other are about a new conspiracy theory called Sabmyk. Sabmik is a conspiracy theory that proposes itself as a better alternative to QAnon. It promotes a quasi-religion centered around a messianic figure known as Sabmyk [53]. This community of channels has, collectively, more than 1 million subscribers. The most popular channel in the community isGreat Awakening Channel with 119,103 subscribers. According to our data, most of these channels were created at the beginning of 2021\u2014130 of them (55.08%) between January and February\u2014with the latest in our dataset created in February 2022. The nature of these channels is very different: Some of them are fake channels of celebrities (e.g., Mel Gibson, Keanu Reeves, Kanye West), others target news outlets or official channels of national bodies (e.g., U. S. Marines Channel, U. S. Navy Channel) and others conspiracy theories like QAnon. Regardless of the name of the channel in the community, the content is always the same. Indeed, they recycle and forward messages among them: Out of the 1,203,986 messages published by these 236 channels, only 65,602 are unique.\nIn this subsection, we scratch the surface of the Sabmyk network, but more investigation and study are needed to understand how Sabmyk attracts such a large number of subscribers and what is\nits ultimate goal, as well as the connection to other conspiracy theories."

            "heading": "5.3 Other use cases",
            "text": "In the following, we report other use cases that we believe are worth exploring using the TGDaset.\nCarding and underground markets. In Section 4.2, we examine the main topics within our dataset. Upon investigating the channels associated with these topics, we discovered several engaging in borderline activities, such as running underground marketplaces. These channels sell electronics, Netflix accounts, and hacking tools at low prices. These types of marketplaces are often associated with carding. Consequently, it is worth delving further into these Telegram channels to determine the types of goods being sold, their origins, whether the channels are just an attempt to fraud subscribers or if they are actually engaged in more illegal activities, and whether there is any correlation with Dark Web marketplaces.\nCopyright Infringement and personal content. Recently, Telegram hit the news several times for its use as a platform for the distribution of copyrighted content (e.g., movies, music, and software). For instance, the Italian authorities seized 545 channels for copyright infringement [42]. However, the problem is even bigger if we consider that the platform is often used to spread personal content without authorization, as in the case of the unauthorized distribution and selling of an Indian teacher\u2019s course material [52]. Or evenworst, when the platform is used to diffuse nude leaked photos [41] or to revenge porn [36]. Joining the information about the topic of the channels, and the description of the messages removed by the platform (Tab. 3), we can observe that the four categories in which is most present the diffusion of copyrighted material are: Carding (448 channels), Indian Edu (219 channels), Video-game modding (208 channels), Adult content (157 channels). Starting from these channels, it is possible to study the diffusion of the phenomenon, understand how these channels are organized, and how they monetize.\nCryptocurrencies frauds. We also find several (563) channels related to the cryptocurrency world. It is well known that Telegram channels are exploited by Pump and Dump groups [46, 58] that perpetrate frauds on the crypto-market. We notice that some of the Pump and Dump channels monitored in [39] are also in our dataset. Previous works monitored the channels in a vertical disjoint way, focusing on the fraud and the groups\u2019 mechanics. Thus, we believe that the TGDatast can help understand how these channels are connected and if they operate together, how they promote their services and likely discover new channels that carry out similar activities.\nFake channels.As in other online social networks, the phenomenon of fake accounts is present in Telegram. As we noticed in the previous subsection, some of the Sabmyk Channels are fake channels that aim to represent VIPs or institutions. Thus, it is interesting to study the phenomenon on this platform to understand how fake channels are exploited. Moreover, given the differences between the Telegram channels and accounts on Online Social Networks (e.g., only the administrator of the channels can write and limited interaction functionalities), it is necessary to develop a proper machine learning model to detect fake channels.\nViolence and extremism. According to several newspapers, the Capitol Hill riot that occurred in January 2021 was planned months before also leveraging Telegram channels and groups [30, 44]. In response to the events of Capitol Hill, the platform has intensified its monitoring and obscured dozens of public channels that publish calls to violence for thousands of subscribers [29]. Nonetheless, despite the commitment of Telegram to obfuscate these channels, we still find within our dataset several public channels promoting the spread of neo-Nazi ideologies or calls to violence (e.g., White Aryan Woman, Feuerkrieg Division **OFFICIAL**). Therefore, the problem is still far from being solved. The TGDataset can help study and characterize these channels. Indeed, the main problem with this type of channel is the absence of a dataset containing them, as they are obscured or blocked once discovered. Instead, the TGDataset includes several unblurred channels of this typology and, therefore, can be used to analyze their features and build a machine-learning model able to detect them automatically."

            "text": "Several studies have been conducted on the Telegram platform and related issues. Hashemi et al. [28] collected Telegram Iranian channels and groups to distinguish high-quality groups (e.g., business groups) from low-quality groups (e.g., dating groups). They found that high-quality groups had longer messages and more user engagement. Nobari et al. [22] performed a structural and topical analysis of Telegram messages, building a dataset of over 2,000 groups and channels and constructing a graph based on mentions. This study found that the PageRank algorithm was not effective in identifying high-quality Telegram channels. Jalilvand et al. [34] tackled the challenge of ranking channels related to a user request on Telegram. Ng et al. [47] analyzed a Singapore-based COVID-19 Telegram group with over 10,000 participants, examining group opinions over time. Their work revealed a peak in engagement when the Ministry of Health raised the disease alert level but a subsequent decline in participation. Baumgartner et al. [18] created a dataset of over 27,800 channels and 317,000 messages from 2.2 million unique users, including right-wing extremist groups and protest movements. Weerasinghe et al. [57] found that Telegram hosts organized groups called \"pods\" where members boost each other\u2019s Instagram account popularity through interaction. Other studies have documented the presence of Telegram channels and groups focused on cryptocurrency pump and dump scams [39, 58]. The work of Urman et al. [55] explored far-right networks on Telegram, revealing that the most prevalent communities are those related to 4chan [14] and Donald Trump\u2019s supporters. Moreover, the authors pointed out that the sudden growth of these networks on Telegram corresponds with the bans of numerous far-right figures on other online social networks. Additionally, numerous studies have investigated the use of Telegram by terrorist organizations such as ISIS for content dissemination and proselytism [20, 59]."

            "text": "This paper presents the TGDataset, a new dataset that includes 120,979 Telegram channels and over 400 million messages. The data collection was conducted with care to only include information from Telegram channels and exclude personal data such as\nusernames, phone numbers, and subscribed channels. Since the dataset includes channels that discuss controversial topics, some controversial messages may be present in the dataset. To comply with ethical standards, we did not download any images or include links in the public dataset as they may contain adult content or copyrighted material. Hence, according to our IRB\u2019s policy, we did not require explicit authorization to conduct our experiments."

            "heading": "8 LIMITATION",
            "text": "To create the TGDataset, we began with 180 seed channels and then employed a snowball technique to grow the dataset. This approach is limited to only reaching channels that are linked by message forwarding. Despite this constraint, we were able to uncover over 100,000 channels and could potentially discover even more through continued iterations. Nonetheless, there may be groups of channels that remain inaccessible from our seed channels.\nIn the TGDataset, channels are represented as a snapshot of their current state. Although some historical details about the channels are available in the dataset, such as their creation date and time stamp of messages, other information is not present in the current version. For instance, a channel during time can change its name, description, and of course, the number of subscribers. This information could be useful for reconstructing the evolution of the channels. In the current release of the TGDataset, we do not retrieve the comments posted by users on channels\u2019 messages or the reaction emojis they may have used (such as the \u2019like\u2019 button on Facebook). While we have observed that many Telegram channels do not use these features, they can still offer valuable insights for future analyses."

            "text": "Telegram has gained significant popularity in recent years. As a result, it is crucial to study and understand the activity taking place on the platform. In this work, we present the TGDataset [38], a collection of more than 120,000 public Telegram channels that, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest collection of channels publicly available. After characterizing the main quantitative aspect of the TGDaset, we performed language detection to understand which are the most popular languages on the dataset. Then, we investigate the main topics covered by the English channels. Other than the dataset, we released as open source the script we used to analyze it and the labeling we obtain (language and topic of the channels). In this paper, we investigate a few possible use cases in which our dataset can be extremely useful. In particular, our preliminary study of the TGDaset revealed the presence on Telegram of channels used to spread questionable content and conspiracy theories. Moreover, we observed the presence of several borderline activities and channels dealing with dubious ethical content. With the release of the TGDataset, we aim to provide a valuable resource to researchers that enable further investigation into these areas leading to a more refined understanding of Telegram and helping to mitigate potential risks to users.\nAs future work, we plan to continue running our data collector and further enlarge the TGDataset, releasing new versions of the dataset at regular intervals of time. Moreover, we intend to overcome the actual limitations by recording channel updates (channel\u2019s\nname, subscribers, and description), adding to the list of channels to monitor also those referenced by link, inserting the possibility to add new seed channels, and collecting replies to messages."
