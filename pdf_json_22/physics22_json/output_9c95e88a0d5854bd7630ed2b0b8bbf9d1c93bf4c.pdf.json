However, low resolution quantization leads to reduced data rate and increased out-of-band emission noise. In this paper, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with linear transceivers using low resolution DACs and ADCs is considered. An information-theoretic analysis of the system to model the effect of quantization on spectrospatial power distribution and capacity of the system is provided. More precisely, it is shown that the impact of quantization can be accurately described via a linear model with additive independent Gaussian noise. This model in turn leads to simple and intuitive expressions for spectrospatial power distribution of the transmitter and a lower bound on the achievable rate of the system. Furthermore, the derived model is validated through simulations and numerical evaluations, where it is shown to accurately predict both spectral and spatial power distributions.",

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nDigital to analog and analog to digital converters (DACs and ADCs) are essential components of any digital communication system. While sub-6GHz systems use high resolution DACs and ADCs, millimeter wave (mmWave) rely on communication across wide bandwidths with large numbers of antennas thereby making high resolution DACs and ADCs very costly in terms of the power consumption [1], [2]. Use of low resolution DACs and ADCs (typically 3-4 bits in I and Q) have been suggested as energy-efficient approaches for next-generation mmWave systems [3]\u2013[21]\nUnlike its high resolution counterpart, low resolution quantization leads to high quantization noise reducing the achievable rate of the system and adding out-of-band (OOB) emission noise which results in high adjacent carrier leakage ratio (ACLR). Therefore, it is of great importance to model this quantization noise and understand its impacts accurately.\nThere is a large body of work on low resolution DACs and ADCs [3]\u2013[24]. The most common model used to approximate the effect of quantization is the additive Gaussian noise (AGN) model [25], [26]. This model has been rigorously analyzed in several works in the high rate quantization regime or under dithered quantization [25], [27]\u2013[30]. For low resolution mmWave systems, it is observed that the AGN and other Gaussian noise predictions match simulations and therefore provide an accurate model of quantization; however, the accuracy is not rigorously justified [15]\u2013[21].\nThe work supported in part by NSF grants 1952180, 1925079, 1564142, 1547332, SRC, and the industrial affiliates of NYU WIRELESS.\nIn [31], we considered a single-input single-output (SISO) communication system with a linear transceiver and low resolution quantization, and using information theoretic tools, proved the validity of the AGN model. In this paper, we extend the analysis of [31] to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. More precisely, we consider a MIMO system using hybrid transceivers with low resolution DACs and ADCs as illustrated in Fig. 1. The transmitter modulates a set of transmit streams through a unitary transform VH prior to the DACs. We model the spectrum of the transmitted signal through the transform r = Vx, where x is the output of the transmitter. Note that if we set the unitary matrix V to an FFT-matrix, we would have a MIMO-OFDM system and can capture filtering and spectral constraints which arise form practical constraint. The MIMO extension of [31] presented here requires new results on empirical convergence and mutual information of two random matrices. In addition, it allows us to study spatial distribution of power as argued below. A summary of our contributions are as follows: \u2022 Rigorous linear model: We analyse a certain large random\nlimit of the system where V \u2208 CN\u00d7N is selected uniformly from N \u00d7 N unitary matrices and provide a rigorous framework for a linear model of quantization. This generalizes our result in [31] which considers only SISO systems (Sec. III). \u2022 Rate and spectrospatial power distribution: We use the derived linear model and provide a simple asymptotically exact expression for per sample spectral covariance matrix of the system in Fig. 1. Such covariance matrices can be computed at both transmitter or receiver leading to spectrospatial power distributions and lower bounds on the system\u2019s capacity (Sec. IV). Furthermore, through simulations and numerical evaluations we show that the derived linear model accurately predicts ACLR and spatial power distribution (Sec. V).\nNotation: x is scalar, x is a column vector whose ith element is xi, and X is a matrix whose (i, j)th element is xij . We denote the column i of X with x:i and with a slight abuse of notation, we denote the transpose of row j with xj:. Also, X is a random column vector and [N ] is the set {1, 2, . . . N}."

This arises from the fact that the quantization noise of a quantizer is white and places power across the spectrum. Similar observation was made for the case of SISO systems in [31]. This suggests that, depending on the system parameters such as DAC resolution, there is a limit on how much OOB emission can be reduced.

As observed, the theorem accurately predicts the simulations and as expected the ACLR is an increasing function of the DAC resolution.\nAchievable rate of the system: Next, we use Thm. 2 to plot the achievable rate of the system. For this case we use the identity matrix for P1. The rate lower bound considering DAC and ADC resolutions of one, three, and five bits are plotted based on (27) from Thm. 2 in Fig. 2c.

Since F(a) is a function of aaH, we can write it as F(t) = G(tHt). Set A = aaH,B = bbH, and C = ccH we have:\nG(A) = G(B)G(C) (32)\nwhere G(T) is a mapping from Cd\u00d7d to C. Therefore,\nG(T) = eJ(T), (33)\nwhere J(T) is mapping from Cd\u00d7d to C and J(A) = J(B)+ J(C). Therefore,\nJ(T) = \u2211 j pl T jTprj \u2211 j Tr ( pl T jTprj ) = \u2211 j Tr ( Tprjpl T j )\n= Tr \u2211 j Tprjpl T j =Tr T \u2211 j prjpl T j  .\n(34)\nAs a result, we can write\nJ(T) = \u22121 4 Tr (PT) , (35)\nWhere P \u2208 Cd\u00d7d. Using T = ttH and substituting (35) in (33), we have\nF(t) = e\u2212 1 4 Tr(Ptt H) = e\u2212 1 4 Tr(t HPt) = e\u2212 1 4 t HPt. (36)\nWhich concludes the proof.\nTo prove the proposition, we use a similar proof as of the paper [37]. Note that the matrix U is left-spherically symmetric. Therefore, any rotation of the rows of matrix U\nwould preserve its distribution. Hence, using Finetti\u2019s theorem, there is a \u03c3 \u2212 field,\u03a8 of events conditional upon which the un:, n \u2208 [N ] are independent and have the same distribution function F (u). Define,\n\u03a6(t) = \u222b eiRe(Tr(t Hu))dF (u) = E [ eiRe(Tr(t Hu)) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03a8],\n(37)\nwhere t \u2208 Cd. The conditional independence means that, for matrix T \u2208 CN\u00d7d,\nE [ eiRe(Tr(T HU)) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03a8] = N\u220f\nn=1\n\u03a6(tr) (38)\nE [ eiRe(Tr(T HU)) ] = E [ N\u220f n=1 \u03a6(tr) ] (39)\nFrom Lemma 2, we know that the left and therefore the right side of (39) are function of THT = \u2211N r=1 t H r tr. Let t\nHt = hHh + gHg. Then,\nE [ |\u03a6(t)\u2212 \u03a6(h)\u03a6(g)|2 ] = E[\u03a6(t)\u03a6(\u2212t)]\n+E[\u03a6(h)\u03a6(g)\u03a6(\u2212h)\u03a6(\u2212g)]\u2212 E[\u03a6(t)\u03a6(h)\u03a6(g)] \u2212E[\u03a6(\u2212t)\u03a6(\u2212h)\u03a6(\u2212g)]. (40)\nAll four elements in the right hand side of (40) are equal since each element is in the form of (39) and is function of 2tHt. Therefore,\n\u03a6(t) a.s = \u03a6(h)\u03a6(g) (41)\nBased on Lemma 3, the solution to this functional equation is\n\u03a6(tH) = e\u2212 1 4 t HPt. (42)\nUsing (38), E [ eiRe(Tr(T HU)) \u2223\u2223\u2223P]\n= E [ N\u220f n=1 e\u2212 1 4 t H nPtn \u2223\u2223\u2223P] = N\u220f n=1 e\u2212 1 4 t H nPtn\n(43)\nTherefore, conditioned on P, un: are i.i.d. \u223c CN (0,P). We can find P as follows\nP (a) a.s = 1\nN N\u2211 n=1 un:u H n: = 1 N UTU*\n(b) =\n1\nN XTX* =\n1\nN N\u2211 n=1 xn:x H n: (c) a.s = E[XXH],\n(44)\nwhere (a) follows from strong law of large number, (b) is due to equality U = VX, and (c) comes from empirical convergence of rows of X to random vector XT."

The mutual information is bounded below by,\nI(Z; Z\u0302) \u2265 M\u2211 m=1 I(Z[m]; Z\u0302[m]). (52)\nThe proof follows using the same steps as of the proof of [31, Lemma 1].\nLemma 5.
