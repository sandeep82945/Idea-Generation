    "abstractText": "We study the Landau level spectrum of bulk graphene monolayers beyond the Dirac Hamiltonian with linear dispersion. We consider an effective Wannier-like tight-binding model obtained from ab initio calculations that includes long-range electronic hopping integral terms. We employ the Haydock-Heine-Kelly recursive method to numerically compute the Landau level spectrum of bulk graphene in the quantum Hall regime and demonstrate that this method is both accurate and computationally much faster than the standard numerical approaches used for this kind of study. The Landau level energies are also obtained analytically for an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for up to third-nearest-neighbor hopping processes. We find an excellent agreement between both approaches. We also study the effect of disorder on the electronic spectrum. Our analysis helps to elucidate the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the high-energy Landau level energies.",

We consider an effective Wannier-like tight-binding model obtained from ab initio calculations that includes long-range electronic hopping integral terms. We employ the Haydock-Heine-Kelly recursive method to numerically compute the Landau level spectrum of bulk graphene in the quantum Hall regime and demonstrate that this method is both accurate and computationally much faster than the standard numerical approaches used for this kind of study. The Landau level energies are also obtained analytically for an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for up to third-nearest-neighbor hopping processes. We find an excellent agreement between both approaches. We also study the effect of disorder on the electronic spectrum. Our analysis helps to elucidate the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the high-energy Landau level energies.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.106.155414\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe pioneering experimental reports [1,2] on the unique features of the quantum Hall (QH) effect in graphene systems played a key role in establishing the remarkable massless Dirac electronic properties of this material [3\u20135]. Subsequent investigations on QH effects in graphene continued to produce fascinating results, such as Klein tunneling [6,7], fractional quantum Hall effect [8,9], and Hofstadter butterflies [10,11], to name a few, attracting a lot of attention to the field (see, for instance, Ref. [12] for a recent review).\nIn addition to electronic transport properties, graphene under strong magnetic fields also shows unique spectral properties under strong magnetic fields. The graphene Landau levels have been theoretically predicted [4,13] to follow\nN = sgn(N )h\u0304\u03c9c \u221a\n|N |, (1) where N is the Landau level (LL) index, \u03c9c = vF \u221a 2eB/h\u0304 is the cyclotron frequency, B is the magnetic field strength, and vF stand for the electron Fermi velocity for B = 0.\nThe LL spectrums have been experimentally measured by transmission [14,15] and scanning tunneling spectroscopy [16,17] for both exfoliated and epithaxial graphene. These studies have verified the \u221a BN dispersion to a good approximation. A systematic transmission spectroscopy study [18] focused on the high-energy LL showed deviations from\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The puzzle is that the disagreement with the experimental data persists even when one improves the theoretical description by accounting next-tonearest-neighbor hopping processes.\nIt should be stressed that, while the massless Dirac Hamiltonian has been shown to be very effective in describing a variety of low-energy electronic graphene properties, the theoretical modeling for higher energies is not unique. The standard approach uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain a tight-binding model based on Wannier orbitals that contain an arbitrary range of hopping terms that fit the nonlinear features of the dispersion relation [19\u201324].\nAnother possibility for the discrepancy between theory and experiment is disorder, which is ubiquitous in graphene [25]. Numerical investigations have studied the broadening of the Landau subbands [26], but there is no systematic study of the corresponding disorder-induced peak shifts. We examine this issue with emphasis on the large |N | limit.\nOur analysis uses the Haydock-Heine-Kelly (HHK) recursive method [27\u201329], also called the Haydock method, an order N [30] real-space computational approach developed to study local spectral functions. It transforms an arbitrary sparse Hamiltonian matrix in a tridiagonal form and evaluates the diagonal Green\u2019s function by a continued fraction expansion, avoiding the need to solve the full eigenvalue problem. The HHK method has been successfully used to compute the local density of states (LDOS) of different compounds [31,32] and more recently in the study of carbon nanotubes [33,34] and disordered graphene systems [35\u201337].\nIn addition to its efficiency, another attractive feature of the HHK method is that, since it relies on the concept of nearsightedness [38], it does not use periodic boundary conditions [39]. Hence, it can be applied to study local spectral properties of disordered systems, quasicrystals [40,41], and\n2469-9950/2022/106(15)/155414(10) 155414-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nsystems with very large primitive unit cells, such as twisted graphene layers and two-dimensional (2D) systems under realistic magnetic fields B. Surprisingly, the HHK method has only been employed once in a case where B = 0, namely, in the investigation of Hoftstadter butterfly energy gaps in square lattices [42]. To the best of our knowledge, so far no one has realized that the method is also fast and very accurate (as we show) for the study of discrete QH spectra.\nRegarding our results, we numerically show that the large|N | LL spectrum analytical solution of the continuum (long wavelength) effective graphene Hamiltonian is very accurate up to |N | 25 and B = 25 T. We include DFT-fitted third-nearest hopping matrix elements into the graphene tightbinding model Hamiltonian and show that agreement between theory and experiment is significantly improved.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the model Hamiltonian we use to describe the electronic properties in graphene, namely, a tight-binding Hamiltonian that accounts for up to third-nearest-neighbor hopping processes. Next, we discuss disorder effects and review the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) predictions for the shifts in the LL subband peak energies and widths. Finally, we briefly present the main steps of the implementation of the HHK method, discuss its computational cost, and benchmark its accuracy. In Sec. III we present our results. We expand previous analytical results for N and show that, despite the approximations involved (discussed in Appendix), the agreement with the numerical values is remarkable. We further show that the inclusion of third-nearest-neighbor matrix elements helps to improve the agreement between theory and experiment and that disorder plays a minor role. We summarize our conclusions in Sec. IV."

Most studies consider only first-nearest-neighbor hopping processes, a simple model that is able to describe the low-energy properties of bulk graphene [3,25]. Tight-binding parametrizations based on DFT [19,21,22,24] show the necessity to including hopping terms beyond first nearest neighbors for a more accurate modeling of the electronic dispersion, particularly when addressing higher energies. Here, we consider first t (1), second t (2), and third t (3) nearest-neighbor hopping terms. Within this approximation it is convenient to write the graphene Hamiltonian in a sublattice matrix representation that in reciprocal space reads [4,43]\nHk \u2261 (\nt (2)|\u03b3k|2 t (1)\u03b3 \u2217k + t (3)\u03b3 \u2032k t (1)\u03b3k + t (3)\u03b3 \u2032\u2217k t (2)|\u03b3k|2\n) , (3)\nwith\n\u03b3k \u2261 1 + eik\u00b7a2 + eik\u00b7(a2\u2212a1 ) (4)\nand\n\u03b3 \u2032k \u2261 1 + ei2k\u00b7a2 + ei2k\u00b7(a2\u2212a1 ), (5) where a1 = \u221a 3a0e\u0302x and a2 = \u221a 3a0/2(e\u0302x + \u221a 3e\u0302y) are the primitive vectors honeycomb lattice and a0 = 1.4 \u00c5 is the carbon-carbon bond length [3]. The first- and third-nearestneighbor hopping terms, which connect different sublattices [3,4], correspond to the off-diagonal matrix elements, while the second-nearest hoppings are related to the diagonal ones. This apparent correspondence between even-odd nearest neighbors and diagonal off-diagonal matrix elements breaks down for fourth nearest neighbors and beyond [23]. In Eq. (3) we neglect a constant diagonal term that shifts the energy spectrum by \u22123t (2).\nThe energy dispersion reads\nk\u03bb = t (2)|\u03b3k|2 + \u03bb|t (1)\u03b3k + t (3)\u03b3 \u2032\u2217k |, (6) where \u03bb labels the valence (\u03bb = \u22121) and conduction bands (\u03bb = +1). Note that the second-neighbors hopping contributions do not depend on \u03bb and thus break the electron-hole symmetry.\nThe presence of an external magnetic field B can be accounted for by the Peierls substitution [44,45], that is, by the transformation\nti j \u2212\u2192 ti j exp [ i e\nh\u0304 \u222b R j Ri dr \u00b7 A(r) ] , (7)\nwhere Rn is the lattice vector associated with the site n, and e is the electron charge. Here, we choose the vector potential A(r) = (0, Bx, 0) that gives a magnetic field B = \u2207\u00d7A = Be\u0302z perpendicular to the graphene layer."

The latter has been developed to calculate the local properties of electronic systems represented on a basis of localized (orthogonal) states |i\u3009, like the one used in the tight-binding Hamiltonian of Eq. (2). The HHK method provides a very efficient O(N ) recursive procedure to transform a given Hamiltonian matrix into a tridiagonal one that is much more amenable for numerical calculation. As mentioned in the Introduction, the HHK method has been successfully used to compute the LDOS of continuous spectra of several systems [31\u201337]. Here, we use it to compute the LDOS of a Hamiltonian with discrete eigenvalues.\nLet us quickly review the main ingredients of the HHK method before discussing its use in computing the graphene Landau level spectrum.\nThe recursion method starts by targeting a given state |0} = | j\u3009. The method generates a hierarchy of states |n} based on the three-term recursion relations [27\u201329],\nH |n} = an|n} + bn|n \u2212 1} + bn+1|n + 1}, (8) with the recursive coefficients\nan = {n|H |n}, (9)\nbn+1 = \u2016(H \u2212 an)|n} \u2212 bn|n \u2212 1}\u2016, (10)\n155414-2\nand the orthogonal basis element\n|n + 1} = 1 bn+1 [(H \u2212 an)|n} \u2212 bn|n \u2212 1}], (11)\nwhere b0 = 0 and | \u2212 1} = 0. Thus, by construction, the Hamiltonian matrix in the orthogonal basis {|n}} is tridiagonal. In turn, the basis functions |n} can be expressed in terms of Wannier-like states | j\u3009,\n|n} = P\u2211\ni=1 Ani|i\u3009. (12)\nHere, we assume that the electronic wave functions are a superposition of P states centered at the atomic sites i and the atomic orbitals are orthogonal to each other, in line with the tight-binding model of Eq. (2).\nThe diagonal Green\u2019s function for the seed state |0} is given by continued fraction [27\u201329]\nG00( ) = {0| 1 \u2212 H |0}\n= 1 \u2212 a0 \u2212 b 2 1\n\u2212 a1 \u2212 b 2 2\n\u2212 a2 \u2212 b 2 3\n. . .\n, (13)\nexpressed in terms of the matrix elements of the tridiagonal Hamiltonian in the basis |n}. The LDOS at any site j can be written as\nLDOS( j, ) = \u2212 1 \u03c0 Im Grj j ( )\n\u2261 \u2212 1 \u03c0 lim \u03b7\u21920+ [Im Gj j ( + i\u03b7)]. (14)\nIn practice, a finite \u03b7 serves as a convenient regularization parameter. For continuous spectra, setting \u03b7 \u2248 2D/M, where D is the bandwidth, guarantees a nice smooth approximation to LDOS( j, ) [27].\nFor pristine systems, due to translational symmetry, the LDOS( j, ) at any j is proportional to the (total) density of states (DOS) \u03c1( ) [46]. In our calculations we fix j at the center of the honeycomb lattice of size P.\nIn previous applications [31,32,42] it has been observed that for a sufficiently large M, the recursive coefficients converge towards their asymptotic values, namely, aM \u2192 a\u221e and bM \u2192 b\u221e. The asymptotic value of a\u221e is associated with the center of the energy band 0, namely, 0 = a\u221e/2 [27,28]. In graphene systems, a\u221e/2 corresponds to the Dirac point energy. For the nearest-neighbor tight-binding Hamiltonian, the center band energy is 0 = 0 and all an coefficients are zero. In this case, by inspecting Eq. (13), one immediately finds that G00( ) = \u2212G00(\u2212 ). This implies that the LDOS( j, ) has electron-hole symmetry for any j and \u03c1( 0) = 0, a condition that defines the so-called Dirac points [3]. When t (2) = 0, the coefficients an are no longer zero, the Dirac points are energy shifted, and the electron-hole symmetry is broken. These simple properties are in line with well-established literature results [3], as they should be."

Throughout this paper we use the tight-binding parameters given in Table I.\nThe optimal number of iterations M depends on P, the size of the system chosen to represent the bulk, as well as on the desired accuracy. A detailed analysis about the dependence of the HHK method accuracy on M for continuum spectra can be found in Ref. [28]. For graphene in the absence of a magnetic field, we find that M \u2248 \u221aP guarantees good accuracy. At the end of this section we study the accuracy for the case where B = 0.\nFigure 1 shows the LDOS of a graphene monolayer obtained from the HHK method for P = 2.5\u00d7107 carbon atoms and M = 5000 iterations. We have contrasted the latter with \u03c1( ) computed by a direct numerical evaluation of \u03c1( ) =\n1 ABZ \u2211 k \u03b4( \u2212 k\u03bb), where k\u03bb is given by Eq. (6) and the wave vectors k are sampled over the Brillouin zone of area ABZ. By accounting for the normalization factor that relates LDOS( j, ) with \u03c1( ), we observe a good agreement within the numerical precision imposed by the regularization parameter \u03b7. We find that differences are only appreciable, as expected, at the band edges as well as at the van Hove singularities.\nLet us now consider the case of a pristine graphene sheet under an external perpendicular magnetic field B. The electronic spectrum becomes discrete and strongly degenerate, forming a sequence of Landau levels. Figure 2(a) shows the graphene LDOS for the tight-binding parametrizations A, B,\n155414-3\nand C computed with the HHK method for B = 25 T, P = 2.25\u00d7106, M = 1500, and \u03b7 = 0.1 meV. Due to the finite \u03b7, the LL are broadened and become Lorentzian distributions whose energy peaks (obtained by fitting) are associated with the LL energies N . Here, we chose \u03b7 | N \u2212 N\u22121|, guaranteeing that the |N | 30 lowest LL peaks are nicely resolved.\nFigure 2(b) shows the convergence of the Landau level energies N as a function of M for a lattice size of P = 2.25\u00d7106, B = 25 T, \u03b7 = 0.1 meV, and the tight-binding parametrization A. Throughout this paper we set the absolute numerical precision to \u03b4 = 10\u22128 eV. We find that by setting M\u2217 = 1500, the accuracy of N is better than \u03b4 for |N | 30. Figure 2(b) shows that the LL energies \u03b5N converge rapidly to their asymptotic values as the number of iterations M increases. The results indicate that the number of iterations M necessary to obtain a given precision \u03b4 scales as M \u2248 \u221a|N |.\nLet us now benchmark the HHK results against another well-established method to compute the LL energies [47]. The most straightforward numerical solution solves the eigenvalue problem for supercells with periodic boundary conditions whose size are dictated by the magnetic field strength and the phases of the Peierls substitution [48]. Here, the computation of the LL spectra involves the diagonalization of matrices of dimension \u223c9.07\u00d7104/B[T] [49], which is computationally very costly for realistic values of the magnetic field. Alternatively, Ref. [47] proposed to consider systems with an infinite ribbon geometry where, by a suitable gauge choice, the magnetic field is encoded in the hopping terms transversal to the ribbon, preserving a \u201cfree\u201d dynamics in\nthe longitudinal direction. In this way, the primitive unit cell has NW sites that depend linearly on the ribbon width W . The k-space domains where the bands are flat, corresponding to energies GNRN , are associated with bulk Landau levels, namely, N \u2248 GNRN . The accuracy relies on W/ B 1, where B = \u221a h\u0304/eB \u2248 26\u221aB[T] nm.\nWe consider graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges for which W = (3NW /4 \u2212 1)a0. Figure 3 shows the convergence of N as a function of NW . In this approach, an accurate assessment of GNRN , with negligible interedge hybridization, requires increasing W (or NW ) for larger |N |, with a computational cost that scales with N3W . We note that by finding an optimized truncated basis set with Nopt < NW , one can significantly reduce computational time, but the number of operations of such a procedure still scales as N3opt. Thus, by comparing Figs. 2(b) and 3 and recalling that the HHK is an O(M ) method, one concludes that the HHK method is rather unexpensive."

Here, our goal is to obtain insight on disorder effects in the DOS of large |N | Landau subbands, particularly on their energy peaks, rather than studying the specifics of a given experimental setup. For this reason we consider a simple model that captures the main features of disorder in graphene, namely, the Anderson disorder model. The on-site energy ui is assumed to be uniformly distributed between \u2212U and +U , that is, with zero mean \u3008ui\u3009 = 0 and variance \u3008\u3008u2i \u3009\u3009 = U 2/3. This model describes the short-range disorder regime [50,52,53] where the impurities scattering range is much smaller than the lattice constant and, thus, impurity scattering mixes the \u03be = 1 (or K) and the \u03be = \u22121 (or K \u2032) valley spinors.\nWe compare our numerical simulation with analytical results. In a pioneering work, Shon and Ando [50] used the SCBA to calculate self-energy impurity average in graphene for different kinds of disorder. For short-range\n155414-4\nimpurities [50],\n( ) = \u03b3 2\n4 Nc\u2211 N=\u2212Nc\n1\n\u2212 N \u2212 ( ) , (15)\nwhere\n\u03b3 2 = \u3008\u3008u 2 i \u3009\u3009nimp \u03c0 2B\n(16)\nis the parameter characterizing the disorder scattering strength and nimp denotes the impurity concentration. The cutoff Nc is introduced to account for the finite bandwidth.\nContrary to the constant spacing of LL in two-dimensional electron gas systems, in graphene the spacing decreases with h\u0304\u03c9c/\n\u221a|N |. This feature makes the evaluation of ( ) somewhat more involved than in the standard case [53]. In the limit of weak scattering strength \u03b3 2 1 and considering the usual inequalities | \u2212 N |, | | N and | \u2212 | < h\u0304\u03c9c/\n\u221a|N | that correspond to isolated LL subbands, the density of states is given by [53]\nDOS( ) = 2 \u03c0\u03b3 2\n\u221a \u03b3 2(1 \u2212 \u03c7 ) \u2212 [ \u2212 N (1 \u2212 \u03c7 )]2, (17)\nwhere\n\u03c7 = \u03b3 2\n(h\u0304\u03c9c) 2 ln (D/ N ), (18)\nand D = h\u0304\u03c9c \u221a\nNc is a Debye-like energy cutoff. The DOS is a sequence of semicircles (or better, elliptical shapes) with maxima at N (1 \u2212 \u03c7 ) and full width at half maximum N = \u03b3 \u221a\n3(1 \u2212 \u03c7 ). Hence, disorder induces a N = \u2212\u03c7 N shift in the LL subband peaks. Note that by taking \u03c7 = 0, one recovers the simple single-isolated subband approximation found in Ref. [50]."

The problem has been attributed to the model Hamiltonian truncation to second-nearest-neighbor hopping terms. Here, we expand the original theoretical analysis by accounting for third- nearestneighbor terms and compare our results both with numerical calculations and with the experimental data.\nThe dispersion relation of graphene can be expressed as a power series in q, defined as q = k \u2213 K, where \u00b1K correspond to \u03b3\u00b1K = \u03b3 \u2032\u00b1K = 0 that defines the so-called Dirac points.

In what follows we show that Eqs. (20)\u2013(22) give an excellent approximation to the LLs energies obtained from the tight-binding Hamiltonian of Eqs. (2) and (7).\nFigure 4(a) compares the analytical \u0303 (1)N with the numerical HHK results (1)N = HHKN for the first-nearest-neighbor tight-binding Hamiltonian, namely, the parametrization A. The insert shows the relative deviation | N/ HHKN | versus N , where N = HHKN \u2212 \u0303 (1)N . The agreement is very good with a relative deviation smaller than 2.3\u00d710\u22124 for |N | < 25. The results indicate that N \u221d |N |5/2, a scaling corresponding to terms related to q3 that have been neglected in the momentum expansion, see Appendix.\nFigure 4(b) contrasts the analytical \u0303 (2)N second-nearestneighbor contribution to the LL spectrum with its numerical counterpart (2)N . The latter is defined as (2) N \u2261 N \u2212 (1)N , where N and (1) N are computed numerically. Both are obtained using the tight-binding parameter set B, but for the calculation of (1)N we set t\n(2) = 0 to single out the secondnearest-neighbor contribution. The insert shows | N/ HHKN | versus N , N = HHKN \u2212 \u0303 (1)N . Here N is \u223c1.01\u00d710\u22123 eV for |N | 25. The origin of (2) is the small discrepancy between the constant diagonal term that shifts the energy spectrum by \u22123t (2) (t (2) = 0.3 eV, see Table I) in the analytical approach and the HHK results, where the shift is \u22120.899 eV.\nFinally, Fig. 4(c) compares \u0303 (3)N with (3). Here, we define (3) N = N \u2212 (1)N \u2212 (2)N , where we use the HHK method to compute N with the parameter set C and (1) N + (2)N by taking t (3) = 0. The results indicate that the third-nearest-neighbor contributions to N are nicely described by the leading |N |1/2 term. Here, in distinction to the first nearest neighbors, the deviation is \u2248 |N |3/2 but still small, | N/ HHKN | 5\u00d710\u22122 for |N | 25.\nLet us now compare our results with the experimental data [18]. Figure 5(a) shows that, since to leading order N \u2248 |N |1/2, all tight-binding parametrizations correctly capture the main trend of N . In Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) we show HHKN \u2212 expN for the conduction and the valence bands. We find that the parametrization B (up to second-nearest-neighbor hopping) considered in Ref. [18] shows the most agreement with the\n155414-5\nexperimental data, with | HHKN \u2212 expN | \u221d |N |3/2. This explains the effectiveness on the extra arbitrary \u201cW\u201d parameter used in Refs. [4,18] to obtain a good fit. The parametrization C (up to third-nearest-neighbor hopping) gives the best results, but still shows some deviations from the experiments. We stress that the tight-binding parameters are fits of DFT calculations to k for B = 0 and not to the LL energies N ."

By involving the ergodic hypothesis one identifies the ensemble average of the LDOS at a given system site with the DOS of the disordered system. In this study, the ensemble averages involve 104 disorder realizations. We use \u03b7 = 0.5 meV as the regularization parameter. This choice guarantees that \u03b7 N for the disorder strengths we study and thus has a negligible effect on the results.\nSince the short-range disorder effects on the DOS are not expected to depend on the tight-binding parameters, here we only consider the parametrization A. The SCBA equation, Eq. (15), can be numerically solved by a simple iteration starting with a given initial value of the self-energy. We have introduced a Debye-like cutoff Nc = 1342 and start the self-consistent loop with an initial self-energy of Im ( ) = 1 meV.

The SCBA predicts a semicircular (or, more precisely, elliptical) shaped DOS( ) for all N . For integer quantum Hall (IQH) systems with quadratic dispersion, it is well established that the DOS of the N = 1 subband has a Gaussian-like shape [54] and the semicircular DOS is expected for N 1. Our results show large deviations from the SCBA independent of N . This observation is consistent with previous numerical investigations of the DOS in graphene at the QH regime [26] and deserves further investigation.\nFigure 7 shows the disorder renormalization of the Landau level subband peak energies N . We define HHKN as the difference between the ensemble average \u3008 HHKN \u3009 and the pristine value HHKN . The SCBA N can be obtained from the numerical solution of Eq.

The study has two goals, namely, to discuss the effect of different kinds of hopping processes to the high-energy LLs in graphene and to introduce an efficient numerical method for this analysis.\nRegarding the methodology, our results show that the HHK method [27\u201329] is very efficient for the computation of the LDOS of graphene in the QH regime. This method has a long record of success, but to the best of our knowledge has not been used to study discrete spectra. Our paper shows that the HHK method is very accurate, and since it is an O(N ) approach, it is computationally much faster than other methods found in the literature [47,49].\nAs for the large-|N | LL spectrum, we show that the analytical solution of the continuum (long wavelength) effective graphene Hamiltonian is very accurate up to |N | 25 and B = 25 T. We find that by including third-nearest hopping processes into the tight-binding model Hamiltonian the agreement between theory and experiment is significantly improved. Although the tight-binding parameters can vary depending on the methodology employed to extract them from DFT calculations, the variations are small and we expect our results to be robust.\nWe also analyzed the effect of disorder. We find a very good agreement between numerical simulations and the SCBA for the disorder-induced renormalization of the LL subband energy peaks N . For realistic disorder strengths, N gives a small correction to N and thus does not impact our conclusions. Interestingly, our simulations indicate that even for large-|N | the subband DOS does not show a semicircular shape, at odds with the theoretical studies of 2D electron gas systems in the QH regime [55\u201358]. We believe this issue deserves further investigation.\nWe expect the HHK method to be useful for the analysis of the LDOS of other QH 2D systems, and since it does not rely on periodic boundary conditions, it can also used in the study of quasicrystals [40,41] and fractal lattices [59].\n155414-7"

Thus, the expansions of the phase factors read\n\u03b3 \u03beq \u2248 \u2212 \u03be 3a0 2 (qx + i\u03beqy)\n+ 3a 2 0 8 (qx \u2212 i\u03beqy)2 + \u03be 3a 3 0 16 |q|2(qx + i\u03beqy), (A1)\n\u03b3 \u2032\u03beq \u2248 \u2212 \u03be3a0(qx + i\u03beqy)\n+ 3a 2 0 2 (qx \u2212 i\u03beqy)2 + \u03be 3a 3 0 2 |q|2(qx + i\u03beqy), (A2)\nwhere \u03be = \u00b11 denotes the valley index and |q|a0 1 guarantees the accuracy of the approximation.\nThe energy dispersion relation in power of |q|a0 is obtained by combining the relations (A1), (A2), and (6). As a result, the energy dispersion up to third-nearest-neighbor hopping is conveniently written as\n\u03bb\u03beq = (1)\u03bb\u03beq + (2)\u03beq + (3)\u03bb\u03beq, (A3)\nwhere\n(1) \u03bb\u03beq \u2248 \u03bbh\u0304v(1)F |q|\n[ 1 \u2212 \u03be a0|q|\n4 cos (3\u03d5q)\n] , (A4)\n(2) \u03beq \u2248 h\u0304v(1)F\nt (2)\n|t (1)| 3a0 2\n|q|2 [\n1 \u2212 \u03be a0|q| 2 cos (3\u03d5q)\n] , (A5)\n(3) \u03bb\u03beq \u2248 \u03bbh\u0304v(1)F\n2t (3)\nt (1) |q|\n[ cos (2\u03d5q) + t (3)\nt (1) \u2212 \u03bea0|q| ( 3\n4 cos (\u03d5q) + t\n(3)\nt (1) cos (3\u03d5q)\n)] . (A6)\nThe term cos(3\u03d5q) is remnant of the symmetry of the underlying lattice and gives rise to the so-called trigonal warping [3,4]. We note that the third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms modify the standard Fermi velocity v(1)F = 3a0t (1)/2h\u0304.\nWe include the magnetic field in the Dirac Hamiltonian by minimal substitution, that is, by replacing the canonical momentum p = h\u0304q by the kinetic momentum, = p + eA(r). The ansatz remains accurate as long as the lattice spacing is much smaller than the magnetic length, B = \u221a h\u0304/eB, a condition fulfilled even by the most intense magnetic field currently produced in laboratory [4]. It is convenient to express the\noperator in terms of harmonic-oscillator ladder operator, namely [4,18],\na\u0302 = B\u221a 2h\u0304 ( x \u2212 i y) and a\u0302\u2020 = B\u221a 2h\u0304 ( x + i y), (A7)\nwith [\u0302a, a\u0302\u2020] = 1. With the help of standard canonical quantization rules, one writes the Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of an external magnetic field B = Be\u0302z as [18]\nH \u03beB \u2261 ( h\u2032\u03be h \u2020 \u03be\nh\u03be h\u2032\u03be\n) , (A8)\nwhere the diagonal element is\nh\u2032\u03be \u2248 h\u0304\u03c9c t (2) |t (1)| 3\u221a 2 a0 B\n[\u0302 a\u2020a\u0302 \u2212 \u03be 1\n2 \u221a 2 a0 B (\u0302a\u20203 + a\u03023)\n\u2212 3 8 a20 2B\n(\u0302a\u2020a\u0302)2 ]\n(A9)\nand the off-diagonal ones are h\u03be \u2248 \u03be h\u0304\u03c9c [(\u0302 a\u2020 + 2t (3)\nt (1) a\u0302\n) \u2212 \u03be a0\u221a\n2 B\n( a\u03022\n2 + 2t\n(3)\nt (1) a\u0302\u20202\n)\n\u2212 a 2 0\n2B\n( 1\n4 a\u0302\u20202a\u0302 + 2t\n(3)\nt (1) a\u0302\u2020a\u03022\n)] , (A10)\nwhere \u03c9c = \u221a\n2v(1)F / B is the cyclotron frequency. Here, we are interested in the |N | 1 limit. Thus, to a good approximation we can neglect 1/N corrections related to the ordering of the ladder operators [4,18] and approximate (\u0302a\u2020\u0302a)2 \u2248 a\u0302\u20202\u0302a2 \u2248 a\u03022\u0302a\u20202.\nHence, solving the eigenvalue equation in two spinors H \u03beB\u03c8N = N\u03c8N , where \u03c8N = (uN , vN )T , the eigenvalue equation for the second spinor component becomes [4]\nh\u03be h \u2020 \u03bevN ( N \u2212 h\u2032\u03be )2vN . (A11)\nThere are terms in h\u2032\u03be and h\u03be h \u2020 \u03be that do not commute with N\u0302 = a\u0302\u2020\u0302a. One solves Eq. (A11) by perturbation theory, which is justified by noting that the corrections are proportional to a0/ B small parameter. With this treatment, trigonal warping is taken into account at leading order. After some algebra, we can write the energies of the LLs in the large |N | limit up to third-nearest-neighbor hopping as\nN = (1)N + (2)N + (3)N . (A12) Note that N is independent of the valley \u03be index. The first two terms,\n(1) N \u2248 sgn(N )h\u0304\u03c9c|N |1/2\n( 1 \u2212 3\n8 a20 2B\n|N | ) , (A13)\n(2) N \u2248 h\u0304\u03c9c\nt (2)\n|t (1)| 3\u221a 2 a0 B\n|N | (\n1 \u2212 3 4 a20 2B\n|N | ) , (A14)\nwere obtained in Refs. [4,18]. Our derivation expands the latter results to account for t (3), namely,\n(3) N \u2248 \u2212sgn(N )h\u0304\u03c9c\n2t (3)\nt (1) |N |1/2\n( 1 \u2212 t (3)\nt (1) \u2212 59 32 a20 2B\n|N | ) .\n(A15)\n155414-8\n[1] K.
