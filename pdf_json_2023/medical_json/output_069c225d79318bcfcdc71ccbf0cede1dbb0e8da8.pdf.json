    "abstractText": "The phenolic compounds in eggplant offer potential natural antioxidants for improved health. A large number of samples were examined in order to find eggplant germplasm with a high potential for health promotion. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variations in total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity in eggplants, including ABTS (2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline6-sulfonic acid)) scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). TPC values varied from 14.19 to 842.90 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g of dry weight of eggplant fruit powder. TPC showed a strong positive correlation with both FRAP and ABTS (r = 0.89 *** and 0.77 ***, respectively). The GWAS identified 20 SNPs that were significantly associated out of 29,183 SNPs. Out of the 20 significant SNPs, 11 showed associations with TPC, 4 with ABTS activity, and 5 with FRAP. Among the SNPs associated with TPC, one SNP was found on each of Chromosomes 3, 4, 7, and 12. In contrast, Chromosome 5 comprised two SNPs associated to TPC. Furthermore, the gene encoding IRX12 laccase-4 on Chromosome 10 was found to contain five SNPs associated with TPC. Four significantly linked SNPs on Chromosomes 1 (1 SNP), 4 (2 SNPs), and 10 (1 SNP) were found to be related to ABTS activity. The identified SNPs will be further examined as markers for selecting desirable eggplant varieties and exploring the links between candidate genes, phenolic content, and antioxidant activity. The findings of this study could assist in further study and the development of eggplants with improved health advantages through targeted breeding.",

            "text": "Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), commonly known as aubergine, brinjal, berenjena, or guinea squash, is a valuable non-tuberous nightshade crop. Eggplants have been grown for centuries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East [1]. According to FAO [2], China is the largest producer of eggplant (22.17 million tons), followed by India (9.89 million tons), Egypt (1.01 million tons), Turkey (0.86 million tons), and Iran (0.55 million tons). In 2021, the global production of eggplant was estimated to be 58.6 million tons [2]. Eggplant is a high-yielding and inexpensive agricultural crop that is grown in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Because of its high nutritional value and extensive applications in the formulation of various types of fresh, canned, and frozen foods, such as pickled, grilled, fried, or stuffed eggplant, as well as different cuisines such as eggplant kibbeh, kashke bademjan, and several eggplant stews, global interest in eggplant farming is rapidly increasing [3,4]. The eggplant fruit not only contains proteins, dietary fiber, minerals, and minerals of interest such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and iron [5], but it is also high in polyphenols, including phenolic acids such as chlorogenic\nGenes 2023, 14, 1315. https://doi.org/10.3390/genes14071315 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes\nGenes 2023, 14, 1315 2 of 17\nacid, p-coumaric acid, and caffeic acid [6,7]. It also comprises flavonoids, including trace quantities of flavonols and a high content of various acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins, especially in purple-colored varieties of eggplant [8]. Among the cultivated members of the Solanaceae family, eggplant is regarded as the best source of total phenolic acids [9]. Phenolic compounds found in eggplant fruit have the ability to reduce abdominal glucose absorption while also providing cellular antioxidant defense, thereby avoiding oxidation and diabetes issues [10]. Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (mainly inflicted with amides or quinic acids) and anthocyanins (mainly delphinidin derivatives) were the most abundant phenolic compounds identified in eggplant [3,11]. Eggplant has been suggested to have plenty of health benefits, playing a significant role in the prevention of chronic diseases [3]. Several beneficial effects on human health have been ascribed to eggplant phenolic compounds, including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective activities [3]. Many studies have proven that eggplant has a wide range of phenolic content with prominent variability among eggplant lines [6,12\u201314]. The highest total phenolic content (TPC) was found in wild relatives of eggplant, including Solanum incanum L. and landraces [9,14]. Thus, landrace is another source of phenolic variation that can contribute to the selection of a successful breeding program. The reliance of agricultural genetic resources on reliable and readily available phenotypic data is a significant challenge in crop genetic resource selection [15]. The rapid advancements of genomics have provided crop breeders with the ability to develop stress-tolerant, disease-resistant, and high-yielding plants. Despite the difficulties, some research has been conducted to determine how the genetics of a plant affect phenolic compounds, antioxidant activities, carotenoids, and anthocyanin in different crops such as barley [16] and ornamental plants, particularly rose petals [17]. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a potent method that utilizes natural genetic variability to decode the genetic basis of complex phenotypes [18]. GWAS provides better mapping resolution and enables the detection of associations between molecular markers and desired traits. Therefore, it is an effective tool for identifying markers linked to desirable traits in various crops [19\u201321]. Its wide-ranging applications in various fields demonstrate its importance in advancing scientific understanding and improving human and crop health. In order to develop superior eggplant varieties with enhanced nutritional properties, it is essential to evaluate a large pool of eggplant germplasm for key chemical components and properties, such as TPC and antioxidant activity. However, analyzing such a large number of genetic resources can be a daunting task. In order to quickly and effectively choose the most promising germplasm for further breeding, genetic association studies can be a useful tool in discovering specific genetic markers linked to significant chemical properties. This study aims to leverage the genetic diversity of eggplant germplasm and identify the possible underlying genetic factors that contribute to the TPC and antioxidant activity (ABTS and FRAP) of eggplants. TPC and antioxidant activity are crucial components that provide health benefits to consumers, making them ideal candidates for selection and improvement. Through a comprehensive analysis of the genetic factors linked to these beneficial traits, the understanding of underlying mechanisms and identification of potential genetic markers will assist future breeding programs in developing eggplant varieties with enhanced nutritional value."

PC1 explained the highest variance (89.90%), followed by PC2 (7.60%) and PC3 (2.50%). The contribution of variables to each principal component was examined. In PC1, TPC, ABTS, and FRAP showed respective contributions of 32.43%, 32.3%, and 35.27% (Figure 3b).

In PC2, TPC and ABTS demonstrated significant contributions of 48.91% and 51.01%, respectively, while FRAP exhibited a negligible contribution of 0.02% (Figure 3c). These findings indicate that TPC and ABTS primarily\nGenes 2023, 14, 1315 7 of 17\naccount for the variance observed in PC2, while FRAP has limited influence. Accessions with higher values for all three variables tend to cluster together in the same direction on the PCA plot, reflecting their overall similarity in terms of these three variables. For example, the following accessions are the top five in terms of their respective chemical content: accession IDs 557, 607, 716, 635, and 434 are higher in TPC content; accession IDs 557, 607, 13, 434, and 76 are higher in ABTS; and accession IDs 557, 607, 114, 434, and 477 are higher in FRAP. The accession IDs and their standard numbers (introduction numbers) can be found in Supplementary Table S1."

Further insights can be gained from Figure 4b, which illustrates the relatedness among the eggplant accessions based on the population structure analysis. The figure reveals the presence of two clusters, represented by different colors: red (Cluster-I) and green (Cluster-II). According to the results, Cluster-I consisted of 124 accessions, while Cluster-II comprised 100 accessions (Supplementary Table S3).

The distribution of SNPs within a 1 Mb window size across all 12 chromosomes can be seen in Figure 5. The study identified a total of 20 SNPs significantly associated with TPC, ABTS, and FRAP. Among these, 11 SNPs were associated with TPC, 4 with ABTS, and 5 with FRAP. The results of the association analysis are presented in the Manhattan (Figure 6) and quantile\u2013quantile (Q\u2013Q) plots (Supplementary Figure S1). Additionally, box plots were used to compare and visualize the average trait values by examining the allelic frequency at specific markers within the GWAS panels, aiming to investigate the relationship between genetic variations and trait expression.

            "text": "The variations in phenolic content and antioxidant activity were evaluated in 224 eggplant genetic resources. Additionally, a genome-wide association analysis was conducted to identify SNPs that exhibited significant associations. The TPC and antioxidant activity varied greatly. The TPC ranged from 14.19 to 844.57 mg GAE/100 g. Reports have also shown a wide range in TPC (range: 22\u201320,490 mg/kg fresh weight) contents in the peel of eggplants [11,39\u201341]. These variations could be attributed to a variety of factors, including ecological differences and genetic makeup differences. Previous research has shown that genotype [42], crop management approaches [43], post-harvest storage temperature, and processing extent all had a significant impact on antioxidant levels in eggplant [44,45]. The principal phenolic compounds in eggplant fruits have been shown to be particularly advantageous for human health owing to their proven biological actions, and they may be utilized to treat a variety of metabolic and cardiovascular illnesses [46]. The study revealed a strong positive correlation between TPC and antioxidant activity, in line with several findings [47\u201349]. This association may be attributed to the fact that phenolic acids and flavonoids, which are predominantly found in TPC, contribute significantly to the antioxidant activity of plants [48]. The germplasm collections of S. melongena, namely K145198 (ID: 557) and K168113 (ID: 607), exhibited higher levels of TPC, ABTS, and FRAP compared to other tested germplasm collections. Furthermore, the PCA analysis demonstrated that these two germplasm collections were distinct and positioned far away from other accessions (Figure 3a). These two accessions were also grouped in Cluster-II, as shown in the population structure analysis (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S3). Molecular breeding is a powerful tool for crop improvement and has been used successfully in a variety of crop species. GWAS enables the mapping of genetic regions associated with economically relevant traits in crop species, including yield, resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, and quality [50\u201354]. This information has also been used in breeding programs to undertake marker-assisted selection (MAS) to find genes underlying phenotypic variation [55]. We identified 20 SNPs (p < 0.0001) associated with phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in eggplant, highlighting the genetic regulation of these traits in the crop. These SNPs have the potential to serve as genetic markers for breeding programs aimed at enhancing phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Similarly, a study on Tibetan wild barley revealed the identification of 20 unique QTLs (p < 0.001) associated with phenolic compounds, flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity [16]. The researchers also suggested that the divergence of these QTLs between wild and cultivated barley populations indicates the impact of domestication on genetic diversity and the potential loss of specific genes or alleles controlling phenolic traits in cultivated barley [16]. Even though phenolic acids are constituents of phenolic compounds and could potentially contribute to TPC and antioxidant activity, no common SNPs were found to be associated with both TPC and antioxidant activity in this study. However, a previous study identified a shared locus (bPb-0836) that was associated with both TPC and antioxidant activity [16]. The lack of common SNPs associated with both TPC and antioxidant activity in the current study compared to a previous study could be attributed to genetic variability, differences in experimental design, marker coverage, statistical power, and the complex nature of the traits. On Chromosome 10, five SNPs significantly associated with TPC were found in a gene that encodes IRX12 laccase-4 (Table 2). Several research findings indicated that laccases (LACs) are involved in the biosynthesis of lignin, which is known to be made up of phenolic compounds. Plant laccase (LAC) enzymes, which are members of the blue copper oxidase/p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase family, have been implicated in lignin production; these enzymes polymerize monolignols into lignin [56\u201358]. Laccases have been cloned and characterized in gymnosperms, monocots, and eudicots, indicating that they played a crucial role in the evolution of the plant vascular system [57\u201361]. Among the 17 known members of the laccase family in Arabidopsis [60,61], 4 (LAC4, LAC11, LAC15, and LAC17) have been identified as being involved in lignin production [62\u201364].\nGenes 2023, 14, 1315 13 of 17\nLignin is a heterogeneous, complex phenolic polymer that accumulates in the cell walls of particular cell types [65]. Lignin gives strength and stiffness to the secondary cell walls of tracheary components, sclereids, and fibers in vascular plants. Lignin accumulation occurs in three stages: biosynthesis of phenolic monomers, mostly phenylpropanoids, in the cytoplasm [66]; export into the apoplast [67]; and subsequent oxidative polymerization in the cell wall by radical coupling catalyzed by laccases (LACs) and class III peroxidases (PRXs) [68]. Among the phenoloxidases linked with lignin, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and poplar (Populus sp.) specific paralogs of LACs are the key enzymes necessary to accumulate lignin in vascular tissues, although their influence on lignin chemistry is unknown [68]. LACs may represent the primary regulatory components capable of channeling extracellular phenolic compounds toward lignin because distinct LAC paralogs are unique to lignifying conditions and have been proposed to induce the transport of phenylpropanoids [67]. Additional investigation is required to determine any potential association of this gene to phenolic compounds. Pleiotropy is a sign that related traits might possibly have some genetic factors in common [69]. One pleiotropic SNP (Ch01: 133053172) was found to have a significant association with both ABTS and FRAP. This SNP is located in the intergenic region. Among the SNPs associated with ABTS, the adjacent genes were a putative disease resistance protein (RGA4) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPB). SNPs associated with FRAP were found in a gene encoding a serine/threonine-protein kinase (haspin homolog), aspartic protease in guard cell 1 (ASPG1) protein, and a protein with an unknown function. Additionally, four SNPs were found in the intergenic region for both ABTS and FRAP, with two SNPs in each. SNPs are commonly located in coding and noncoding regions, as well as intergenic regions of genomes. They have varying abundance across these genomic regions, with a frequency of approximately 1 SNP per every 100\u2013300 base pairs of DNA [70]. Intergenic spacers are often the focus of genetic diversity characterization [71]. While polymorphisms in coding regions can impact gene function [72\u201374], the majority of functionally significant variants are found in intergenic regions. This trend holds true across various species. For instance, in maize, high-resolution GWASs targeting multiple traits have revealed that 70% of significant functional associations are located in intergenic regions [75]. Therefore, the assessment of SNPs identified in the intergenic regions as potential markers for the desired trait is highly valuable. Figure 7 illustrates the variation in mean values of TPC and antioxidant activity based on the frequency of different alleles at specific marker positions. The observed differences highlight the potential impact of these markers on the traits of interest. In addition to the markers presented in this study, further marker SNPs will be evaluated as potential indicators, both individually and in combination, for selecting eggplant accessions with high TPC and antioxidant activity. The development of markers can greatly assist selection and breeding programs aimed at developing nutritionally enriched eggplant varieties."
