 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the genetic basis of STEM interest and aptitude in childhood and adolescence. The current study looked at adult occupational choice, but understanding early interests and abilities could inform educational interventions. 

2. Investigate gene-environment interactions influencing STEM choices, such as how genetic predispositions interact with gender norms, stereotypes, and biases. This could identify targeted interventions to increase STEM participation.

3. Explore the genetics of specific STEM fields like engineering, computer science, mathematics, etc. There may be field-specific genetic variants that were not detected in the broad STEM category. 

4. Conduct multi-ancestry GWAS of STEM occupations to find additional genetic loci and generalizable insights across populations. The current study was limited to individuals of European descent.

5. Examine associations between genetic factors, STEM education, innovation, and regional economic growth. The links found at the regional level could be further explored using individual-level data on education, entrepreneurship, patents, and economic outcomes.
