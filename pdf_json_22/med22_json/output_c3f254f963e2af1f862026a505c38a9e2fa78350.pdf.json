    "abstractText": "Introduction: The maximum gain in quality of life after lung transplantation (LT) is expected between six months and one year after LT, as the occurrence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction may mask the beneficial effects beyond one year. Thus, the postoperative period could be the cornerstone of graft success. We sought to describe the factors present before postoperative admission to the ICU and associated with favorable, arduous or fatal pathway within 90 days of LT. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective single\u2010center study between January 2015 and December 2020. Using multinomial regression, we assessed the demographic, preoperative and intraoperative characteristics of patients associated with favorable (duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation < 3 days and alive at Day 90), arduous (duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation \u2265 3 days and alive at Day 90) or fatal (dead at Day 90) path\u2010 way within 90 days of LT. Results: A total of 269 lung transplant patients were analyzed. Maximum graft cold ischemic time \u2265 6 h and intra\u2010 operative blood transfusion \u2265 3 packed red blood cells were associated with arduous and fatal pathway at Day 90, whereas intraoperative ECMO was strongly associated with fatal pathway. Conclusion: No patient demographics influenced the postoperative pathway at Day 90. Only extrinsic factors involv\u2010 ing graft ischemia time, intraoperative transfusion, and intraoperative ECMO determined early postoperative pathway.",

            "text": "Lung transplantation (LT) is currently recognized as a life-saving therapy for patients with end-stage lung disease. LT represents more than 4000 procedures per year in selected patients for whom optimal medical treatment is no longer sufficient to maintain quality of life or shortterm survival [1, 2]. However, the overall median survival of 6.7\u00a0years is still lower than that of any of the other solid organ transplants and is impacted by early deaths mainly related to graft dysfunction, infections and cardiovascular complications [3].\nThe maximum gain in quality of life is expected between six months and one year after LT, as the occurrence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction may mask the beneficial effects beyond one year [4]. Thus, the postoperative period could be the cornerstone influencing patient outcome and transplant success. Unfortunately, it remains very difficult to predict the patient\u2019s early postoperative prognosis. Basically and arbitrarily, the early pathway of patients after LT could follow three trajectories: favorable, arduous and fatal.\n*Correspondence: alexy.trandinh@aphp.fr\n1 Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, AP\u2011HP, H\u00f4pital Bichat Claude Bernard, Anesth\u00e9sie\u2011 R\u00e9animation, Paris, France Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nOur study sought to identify factors present before postoperative admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and associated with favorable, arduous and fatal pathway within 90\u00a0days of LT."

            "text": "We explored for the first time, to our knowledge, the risk factors present before postoperative ICU admission and associated with three trajectories of pathway, favorable, arduous or fatal, within 90\u00a0 days after LT. Intraoperative ECMO, graft cold ischemic time \u2265 6\u00a0h and intraoperative blood transfusion \u2265 3 PRBCs were independent risk factors for arduous or fatal pathway at Day 90.\nIntraoperative ECMO was strongly associated with a comorbid postoperative stay in the ICU, grade 3 PGD and 90-day mortality. The impact of intraoperative ECMO on 90-day survival has been poorly studied. Zhang et\u00a0al. recently showed that patients with intraoperative ECMO were more likely to have an increased 3-month mortality rate compared with those without ECMO, although it did not reach statistical significance (27.3 vs. 17.2%, p = 0.25) [12]. The largest studies of perioperative ECMO use have primarily evaluated patient survival at one year and beyond, with contradictory results. Ius et\u00a0al. showed higher in-hospital mortality rates [13] and higher 3-, 5- and 8-year mortality rates for patients requiring intraoperative ECMO [14], although ECMO was not selected as an independent risk factor. In contrast, Hoetzenecker et\u00a0al. observed improved 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates compared with non-ECMO patients [15]. It should be noted that central cannulation was predominant, except for patients using peripheral ECMO as a bridge to transplant.\nThe high rate of intraoperative ECMO (70%) in our cohort and the poor prognosis of patients under ECMO could be explained by their significant comorbidities. Forty-nine patients required preoperative ECMO and all were transplanted with intraoperative ECMO using the high-emergency procedure. Therefore, candidates for high-emergency transplantation requiring preoperative ECMO should be carefully selected. The median (IQR) and mean \u00b1 SD age were 56 (50\u201362) years and 54 \u00b1 11\u00a0 years, respectively, compared to 48 (31\u201355)\nyears in the study of Ius et\u00a0al. [13] and 45.2 \u00b1 16.2\u00a0years in the study of Hoetzenecker et\u00a0 al. [15]. In a retrospective analysis of 8363 patients from the UNOS database, Weiss et\u00a0al. showed that older patients had an increased risk of death after LT [16]. Pulmonary fibrosis, a wellknown risk factor for intraoperative ECMO [12, 12] and for higher posttransplant mortality [3], represented 58% of our transplant recipients, compared to 30% in the two studies mentioned above [13, 13]. Single LT accounted for 31.5% of the procedures, whereas it was only 3% for the study of Ius et\u00a0al. [13] and the study of Hoetzenecker et\u00a0 al. exclusively focused on bilateral LT [15]. Single LT has previously been identified as a risk factor for intraoperative ECMO [13] and overall poorer survival rates compared with double LT [17]. In addition, 66.8% of patients with intraoperative ECMO were male, compared to 54% [13] and 48% [15] in the other studies. Male sex was consistently associated with a higher mortality rate after LT [18\u201321].\nIn our cohort, the vast majority of intraoperative ECMO was unplanned, except for patients on ECMO bridging before LT. Our practice is to implant ECMO \"on demand\u201d when irreversible hemodynamic and/or respiratory instability is deemed irreversible by the practitioners in charge of the patient occurs during surgery, especially when clamping the pulmonary artery branch. However, the impact of intraoperative ECMO on survival does not appear to be related to implantation strategies, as Ius et\u00a0al. observed no difference in survival between a priori and on-demand strategies [13]. The rate of prolonged ECMO during the postoperative course in the ICU was 40% and was similar to their rates of 41% [13] and 36% [15].\nWe identified a primary diagnosis of ILD and pretransplant mPAP \u2265 25\u00a0mmHg as risk factors for intraoperative ECMO, as previously reported [12, 12]. The association of intraoperative ECMO with a greater risk of grade 3 PGD confirmed what had previously been observed [14].\nECMO Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, PRBC packed red blood cell"

            "text": "The impact of graft cold ischemic time on graft failure and survival remains under debate. Prolonged ischemia \u2265 6\u00a0h was an independent risk factor for arduous and fatal pathway within 90\u00a0days and was likely to be associated with more reports of grade 3 PGD, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Some previous studies have reported similar results [22, 22], while others have found no association [24\u201326]. However, it was suggested that the cold ischemia time could have a greater impact for the most fragile patients [26]. We identified recipient age \u2265 60\u00a0years, a marker of frailty, as an independent factor associated with prolonged ischemia \u2265 6\u00a0h.\nIntraoperative blood transfusion \u2265 3 PRBCs was independently associated with arduous and fatal pathway, with more reports of comorbidities during postoperative ICU stay and more reports of grade 3 PGD. Blood loss during surgery has been consistently associated with more postoperative complications, but the impact on mortality remains unclear [27, 27]. Factors associated with high PRBC transfusion during surgery were high-emergency LT and double LT. High-emergency LT is a national prioritization system for the most severe patients with fibrosis, cystic fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension that was introduced in France in 2007. As a different method than the Lung Allocation Score [29], the allocation rules in France are developed by the Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine in collaboration with the transplant community, and this is the responsibility of a lung transplant team that selects the recipient it believes will benefit most from the allograft [30]. The Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine develops the allocation rules in France in collaboration with the transplant community. Before September 2020, the lung transplant allocation system was based on national allocation for patients with highemergency status and local, regional, and then national allocation for elective patients. However, this transplant allocation model has generated significant geographic disparities across transplant centers, with an average of grafts offered per candidate ranging from 1.4 to 5.2. Thus, as of 8 September 2020, a new system was implemented that restricted the local allocation according to the supply/demand ratio, eliminating regional sharing and increasing national sharing. The supply/demand ratio was defined as the ratio of the number of lungs recovered in the local allocation unit to transplants performed in the center [31]. Patients can be candidates for the high-emergency waiting list if they need mechanical ventilation or if they are at risk of undergoing mechanical ventilation with an oxygen dependency greater than 12 L/min associated with an SpO2 < 90% despite maximal treatment and in the absence of a reversible cause. The presence of severe organ failure or uncontrolled sepsis\ncontraindicates access to this emergency procedure [32]. Overall, this indication is assessed by independent and anonymous experts designed by the French Biomedicine agency. Patients on a high emergency waiting list often require ECMO as a bridge to transplant, a condition that has been associated with blood loss during LT [28]. In contrast, patients who received thoracic epidural analgesia were less likely to receive a massive transfusion. We hypothesized that epidural anesthesia, by providing sympathetic blockade, may reduce peripheral venous bleeding mediated by venous hypotension resulting from decreased peripheral resistance, while vital organ perfusion is maintained by sustaining cardiac output through norepinephrine and fluid management. Hypotensive epidural anesthesia has been shown to reduce blood loss in urological surgery [33].\nThis study has several major limitations, which are its single-center and retrospective nature. The external validity of our results must be interpreted with caution, as these observations depend on the etiologies of LT, the selection of candidate patients, and their management, all of which may vary from one center to another."
