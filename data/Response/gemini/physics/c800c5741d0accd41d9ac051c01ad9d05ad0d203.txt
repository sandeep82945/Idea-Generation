1. **Investigate the use of different nanomaterials for the modification of SPEs for HMI detection.** This could include exploring the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), carbon nanotubes, or graphene oxide. These materials have been shown to have excellent electrochemical properties and could potentially improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the SPE/NPC sensor.


2. **Develop a portable device for the on-site detection of HMIs in milk powder.** This could be achieved by integrating the SPE/NPC sensor with a portable potentiostat and a data acquisition system. Such a device would allow for rapid and convenient testing of milk powder samples in the field.


3. **Explore the use of the SPE/NPC sensor for the detection of other heavy metals in food products.** This could include metals such as mercury, arsenic, and chromium. By optimizing the experimental parameters, the SPE/NPC sensor could be tailored to detect a wide range of heavy metals in various food matrices.


4. **Investigate the use of the SPE/NPC sensor for the detection of HMIs in other environmental samples.** This could include water, soil, and air. By modifying the sample preparation procedure, the SPE/NPC sensor could be used to detect HMIs in a variety of environmental samples.


5. **Develop a method for the simultaneous detection of multiple HMIs in milk powder using the SPE/NPC sensor.** This could be achieved by using a multivariate calibration technique, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares regression (PLSR). By analyzing the stripping voltammetry data, the SPE/NPC sensor could be used to simultaneously determine the concentrations of multiple HMIs in milk powder samples.
