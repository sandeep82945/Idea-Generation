Automated Algorithm Development for SPPB Interpretation: Building on the study's acknowledgment of the challenge in manually interpreting plantar pressure graphs, future research could focus on developing and validating automated algorithms. These algorithms would analyze plantar pressure data in real-time, reducing the need for manual interpretation and potentially increasing the accuracy and efficiency of SPPB assessments.

Longitudinal Study on the Impact of Smart Insole Use: Conduct a longitudinal study to investigate how continuous monitoring and feedback provided by smart insoles might influence the physical activity levels, gait, and overall functional status of older adults. This could include interventions designed to improve or maintain physical function based on the insights gained from smart insole data.

Comparative Effectiveness of Smart Insoles Across Different Conditions: Explore the effectiveness and accuracy of smart insoles in assessing functional status and predicting outcomes across various geriatric conditions, including Parkinson's disease, sarcopenia, and frailty. This could help to determine the broader applicability of smart insoles in geriatric care and rehabilitation.

Integration with Other Digital Health Technologies: Investigate how smart insoles could be integrated with other digital health technologies, such as wearable sensors, mobile health applications, and telehealth platforms, to provide a comprehensive monitoring and intervention system for older adults. This research could explore the synergies between different technologies in enhancing patient care and support.

Cost-Effectiveness and Accessibility Study: Conduct a study to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing smart insoles as a standard tool for physical performance assessment in geriatric healthcare settings. Additionally, research could explore ways to improve the accessibility of this technology for diverse populations, considering factors such as socioeconomic status, technological literacy, and geographic location.
