1. **Investigate the long-term effects of antibiotic exposure on bivalves.** This could involve studying the effects of chronic exposure to low levels of antibiotics on bivalve growth, reproduction, and survival.
2. **Develop new methods for removing antibiotics from wastewater.** This could involve developing new technologies or improving existing ones to make them more efficient and cost-effective.
3. **Study the fate and transport of antibiotics in the environment.** This could involve tracking the movement of antibiotics through different environmental compartments, such as water, soil, and air.
4. **Assess the risks of antibiotic resistance to human health.** This could involve studying the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment and the potential for these bacteria to be transmitted to humans.
5. **Develop new strategies for preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance.** This could involve developing new antibiotics that are less likely to promote resistance, or developing new ways to use antibiotics to minimize the risk of resistance development.
