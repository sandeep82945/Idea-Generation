A constraint is said first-class if its Poisson brackets with all constraints vanish weakly. A constraint that is not first-class is called second-class. First-class constraints imply the existence of a gauge invariance and it is well known that first-class constraints can be used to generate gauge transformations. gauge symmetries are important in the context of the modern fundamental interaction theories and gravitation. Their rich underlying structures allow us to establish currents and charges conserved (conservation laws) and then defining physical states by removing unphysical degrees of freedom and preserving the unitarity of the S-matrix elements, as well as to establish the Ward identities in order to prove the renormalizability and to remove anomalies. In fact, the principle of gauge symmetry along with generalized quantum field theories based on the standard mathematical techniques for perturbation theories (see, for instance, [6\u20139]) can be used as an alternative approach to construct physical theories. In addition it provides a natural geometric-topological set-up for describe a wide range of quantization aspects on pure algebraic grounds by using the homotopy (or (co-)homology) operators [5, 8].\nConsequently, any fundamental theory can be better structured and understood if formulated as a genuine gauge theory since the advantages are many. A prototypical example of second-class constrained dynamical system are the massive Yang-Mills theories. At the original construction, the formation of a dynamical gluon mass m2Aa\u00b5A a \u00b5 is forbidden due to the fact that it destroys the gauge invariance. However, there are powerful reasons to consider a mass term since it might play an important role in the nonperturbative regime. This possibility was pointed out by the considerable amount of results obtained through theoretical and phenomenological studies (as in Gribov-Zwanziger, Schwinger-Dyson or QCD sum rules models) as well as from lattice simulations (vide, for instance, [9\u201317] and references therein). Then, this is a clear example where it is desirable to reformulate the mass term to restore the original gauge symmetry. Nevertheless, at low energy QCD standard perturbative techniques cannot be used due to the coupling constant is strong. Effective degrees of freedom in QCD are given by hadrons and another exotic composite states, so the study of hadronic properties requires most of the times of effective models1. A particular form to describe baryons and its interactions with a medium is given by the Skyrme model [18], a nonlinear mesonic model with non-trivial soliton field (who acts as baryon). The Skyrme term is a chiral perturbative correction to the non-linear \u03c3-model which gives rise to the second-class constraints. It has a great versatility to model diverse problems of nuclear matter among which we can mention spin-isospin correlations (axial coupling), charge radii, magnetic moments, many-bodies nuclear interaction, hadronic crystal lattice and medium modified meson proprieties [19\u201322]. For a complete review see [23].\nThe gauge freedom can result in a simplified algebras by choosing the adequate fixing\n1 Numerical calculations in lattice QCD suffers tecnical problems to implement hadron proprieties too due\nto the chiral symmetry breaking.\nterm in each case2. The general idea is to rewrite a second-class system as a first-class one, and thus the complete dynamical system exhibits a gauge symmetry. Several methods in the Hamiltonian formalism are available to implement this process among which we can mention the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin [24\u201327] and the gauge unfixing (GU) formalism [28\u201330]. The last formalism performs this conversion to equivalent gauge invariant theories without the extension of the original phase space variables. The original motivation of the GU formalism and its improved versions [31, 32] is to use one of the second-class constraint3 as a symmetry generator. The other will be discarded. Then, the invariant quantities obtained will be written as a powers series of the discarded constraint. The coefficients of this series will be given by successive transformations of the original variabe under the new symmetry generator [30, 33]. In quantum field theory, this formalism has been successfully used in Abelian models such as Chern-Simons, Proca and Carroll-Field-Jackiw [30, 33, 34]. Then, the aim of the present work is to face the issue of the gauge invariance restitution of nonAbelian second-class theories. As far as we know, the only attempt to approach a non-abelian model using the GU formalism was performed in [35] for pure non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory (without Maxwelll term). Here we provide a general analysis of the GU variables as a power series of the discarded constraint. In all the above mentioned articles related to the use of GU formalism, the correction terms in order n \u2265 2 are null in the power series including the non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory. This will not be the case for Yang-Mills theories as we will show later. In fact, the issue of the gauge invariance for non-Abelian vector fields has been addressed in [36] where the dressing functions written in trems of infinite sum of non-local terms are used to define invariant quantities. Here we can mention that, for the non-Abelian Stu\u0308ckelberg mechanism with mass term, the invariance requeriment implies a non-polynomial action [37\u201339]. Therefore, it is natural to be expected that, unlike the Abelian cases, Yang-Mills models, whose gauge transformations depend on the covariant derivative, will generate invariant variables without truncations in the power series.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we give an outline of the improved GU formalism and its non-Abelian extension. In Sec. III we apply our formalism to the SU(N) massive Yang-Mills model. Sec IV is devoted to the study of the SU(2) Skyrme model. Sec. V contains our conclusions."

By the definition, the Poisson bracket of these constraint is non non-trivial and it is given by\n{\nT a1 , T b 2\n}\n= \u03b4abK, (1)\n2 Several algebraic consequences of the first-class conversion were explored in [24, 25]. 3 in case the system has two second-class constraints.\nwhere K 6= 0 is non-vanishing constant on the surface defined by the constraints T a1 and T a2 . Following the gauge unfixing formalism [29, 30], one of the constraints can be used as generator of infinitesimal transformations and the other one is disregarded (no longer considered a constraint after the reformulation). Without any loss of generality, we can also set the generator of infinitesimal transformations as4\n\u03c7a = K\u22121T a1 \u2248 0, (2)\nsuch that, on the surface defined only by \u03c7a,\n{ \u03c7a, T b2 } \u2248 { K\u22121T a1 , T b 2 }\n\u2248 K\u22121 { T a1 , T b 2 } + { K\u22121, T b2 } T a1 \u2248 \u03b4ab + {\nK\u22121, T b2 } K\u03c7a, (3)\nthat is, \u03c7a and T a2 form an approximate canonically conjugate pair on \u03c7 a \u2248 0. The constraint T a2 will be disregarded, that is, it will no longer be considered a constraint. Consider now a second class function F a(qa, pa) 5. In the improved gauge unfixing formalism [31, 32], the invariant first class function F\u0303 a is constructed by as a power series of the discarded constraint T a2 :\nF\u0303 a = F a + cab1 T b 2 + c abc 2 T b 2T c 2 + . . .\n= F a + \u2211\nk=1\ncaw1...wkk\nk \u220f\ni=1\nTwi2 , (4)\nwhich has the following boundary condition\nF\u0303 a|Ta 2 \u22480 = F a.

(10)\n4 The symbol \u201c\u2248\u201d means weak equality, namely they holds only on the hyper-surface defined by the inter-\nsection of the constraints on the full phase space. 5 The \u201ccolor\u201d index \u201ca,b,c...\u201d represents the degrees of freedom and take values of fields in the Lie Algebra\nIn the above equations, \u03b4a is the variational operator valued in the Lie algebra for the transformation induced by the generator \u03c7a and \u03b5 is an arbitrary infinitesimal parameter. We will assume that there is no an a priori symmetry in the color indices of the coefficients ck. Then, from (7), we can derive an equation for zeroth order terms in T a 2 :\n\u03b4mF a + cab1 \u03b4 mT b2 = 0 \u21d2 c am 1 =\n\u03b4mF a\n\u03b5 (11)\nFor linear terms in T a2 , we get\n\u03b4mcab1 T b 2 + c abc 2 \u03b4 mT b2T c 2 + c abc 2 T b 2\u03b4 mT c2 = 0 \u21d2 c amb 2 =\n\u03b4m\u03b4bF a\n2\u03b52 (12)\nThen, from equations (11) and (12), we can observe that, for k \u2265 3, the general relation is\ncaw1...wkk = 1\nk!\u03b5k\nk \u220f\ni=1\n\u03b4wiF a, (13)\nThis expression is the non-Abelian analogue of the expression found in [32, 34, 35]. Therefore, the expression for the invariant first class function F\u0303 a, eq. (4), becomes\nF\u0303 a = F a + T b2 \u03b4bF a\n\u03b5 + T b2T c 2\n\u03b4b\u03b4cF a\n2\u03b5 + . . .\n=\n(\n1 + \u2211\nk=1\n1\nk!\u03b5k\nk \u220f\ni=1\nTwi2 \u03b4 wi\n)\nF a\n=: eT b 2\n\u03b4 b \u03b5 : F a, (14)\nwhere we adopted an ordering prescription \u201c :: \u201d that T a2 \u2019s always come before the variation operator\n1 \u03b5 \u03b4af = {f, \u03c7a} , (15)\nfor any functional f on the phase space. The last line in (14) shows us that, as pointed out by [30], any gauge invariant quantity can be generated by applying the projection operator P =: eT b 2 \u03b4 b\n\u03b5 : on function in the phase space. In the next section, we will consider some examples to show the use of the improved gauge unfixing formalism for some non-Abelian theories.\nIII. MASSIVE SU(N) YANG-MILLS MODEL\nTo start the illustrations, we begin with massive SU(N) Yang-Mills model in d = 4 Euclidean dimensions6, which is represented by the following action:\nS =\n\u222b\nd4x\n(\n1 4 F a\u00b5\u03bdF a \u00b5\u03bd +\nm2\n2 Aa\u00b5A a \u00b5\n)\n, (16)\n6 We are working in Euclidean space to avoid issues of the validity of the Wick rotation at the non-\nperturbative regime.\nwhere F a\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202\u00b5A a \u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bdA a \u00b5 + f abcAb\u00b5A c \u03bd is the field strength. In other words, this is the nonAbelian version of the Proca Lagrangian. Because of the presence mass term, this Lagrangian is no longer invariant under gauge transformations. The canonical momenta are given by\n\u03c0a\u00b5 = \u2202L\n\u2202 ( \u22020Aa\u00b5 ) = F a0\u00b5, (17)\nfrom which we define the following fundamental Poisson brackets: {\nAa\u00b5(x), A b \u03bd(y)\n} = { \u03c0a\u00b5(x), \u03c0 b \u03bd(y) }\n= 0 (18) {\nAa\u00b5(x), \u03c0 b \u03bd(y)\n}\n= \u03b4ab\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4 (3)(x\u2212 y) (19)\nFrom equation (17) we get primary constraint of the model:\n\u03c0a0 = 0 \u2261 T a 1 \u2248 0, (20)\nThe canonical momenta \u03c0ai are given by\n\u03c0ai = F a 0i. (21)\nFor the complete investigation of the canonical structure of the model, we must now write down the canonical Hamiltonian of the model, Hc, which is obtained from a Legendre transformation that leads to\nHc =\n\u222b\nd3x\n{\n1 2 \u03c0ai \u03c0 a i + \u03c0 a i ( \u2202iA a 0 \u2212 gf abcAb0A c i ) \u2212 1 4 F aijF a ij \u2212 1 2 m2 (Aa0A a 0 + A a iA a i )\n}\n, (22)\nFrom the stability condition of the constraint T a1 [1\u20135], we obtain a secondary constraint\nT\u0307 a1 = {T a 1 (x), Hp(y)} \u2248 0\n= Dabi \u03c0 b i +m 2Aa0 \u2248 0 \u2261 T a 2 (23)\nwhere Hp is the primary hamiltonian, namely\nHp = Hc +\n\u222b\nd3x\u03bba1(x)T a 1 (x), (24)\nand Dab\u00b5 = \u03b4 ab\u2202\u00b5 \u2212 gf abcAc\u00b5 (25)\nis the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation. The time evolution of the constraint T a2 determines the Lagrange multiplier \u03bb a 1:\n\u03bba1 = D ab i A b i . (26)\nThis indicates that no more constraints are generated via this iterative procedure. That is, T a1 and T a 2 are the only constraints of the theory. Further, they form the following second class algebra: {\nT a1 (x), T b 1 (y)\n}\n= 0, (27) {\nT a1 (x), T b 2 (y)\n}\n= \u2212m2\u03b4ab\u03b4(3)(x\u2212 y), (28) {\nT a2 (x), T b 2 (y)\n}\n= gfabcT c1\u03b4 (3)(x\u2212 y). (29)\nThe total hamiltonian is then given by\nHT = Hc +\n\u222b\nd3x (\u03bba1T a 1 + \u03bb a 2T a 2 ) . (30)\nDemanding again time-independence of the constraint T a1 , but this time using the total hamiltonian (30), the Lagrange multiplier \u03bba2 is fixed as\n\u03bba2 = 1\nm2 T a2 \u2248 0. (31)\nWe are now able to apply the improved gauge unfixing formalism to this model. We have two available choices, as the system presents two second class constraints. By choosing T a1 as the generator of infinitesimal transformations, the field variations are similar to those of the abelian case [33]. In contrast, the infinitesimal transformations generated by the constraint T a2 lead to new features in the non-Abelian case. Therefore, we will focus on the second case. We first redefine T a2 as\n\u03c7a \u2261 1\nm2 T a2 , (32)\nsuch that {\n\u03c7a(x), T b1 (y) } = \u03b4ab\u03b4(3)(x\u2212 y). (33)\nT a1 will be ignored as a constraint. The infinitesimal transformations generated by \u03c7 a are\n\u03b4aAb0(x) =\n\u222b\nd3y\u03b5(y){Ab0(x), \u03c7 a(y)} = 0, (34)\n\u03b4aAbi(x) =\n\u222b\nd3y\u03b5(y){Abi(x), \u03c7 a(y)} = \u2212\n1\nm2 Dbai \u03b5(x), (35)\n\u03b4a\u03c0b0(x) = \u03b4 aT b1 (x) =\n\u222b\nd3y\u03b5(y){\u03c0b0(x), \u03c7 a(y)} = \u2212\u03b5(x)\u03b4ba, (36)\n\u03b4a\u03c0bi (x) =\n\u222b\nd3y\u03b5(y){\u03c0bi (x), \u03c7 a(y)} = \u2212gfabc\u03b5(x)\u03c0ci (x) (37)\nFrom the above relations, one can note that Aai and \u03c0 a i (x) are the relevant noninvariant fields under infinitesimal transformations generated by \u03c7a. We will start by seeking an invariant field A\u0303ai , which is constructed by a power series of the disregarded constraint T a 1 (vide eq. (4)):\nA\u0303ai (x) = A a i (x) +\n\u221e \u2211\nk=1\n\u222b\n(\nk \u220f\nr=1\nd3xr\n)\ncaw1...wkki (x1, ..., xk; x)\n(\nk \u220f\nr=1\nTwr1 (xr)\n)\n. (38)\nThe next step is to determine the coefficients cki. For this goal, we impose to A\u0303 a i the variational condition (7):\n\u03b4mA\u0303ai (x) = \u03b4 mAai (x)+\n\u221e \u2211\nk=1\n\u222b\n(\nk \u220f\nr=1\nd3xr\n)\n\u03b4mcaw1...wkki (x1, ..., xk; x)\n(\nk \u220f\nr=1\nTwr1 (xr)\n)\n+\n+\n\u221e \u2211\nk=1\n\u222b\n(\nk \u220f\nr=1\nd3xr\n)\ncaw1...wkki (x1, ..., xk; x)\u03b4 m\n(\nk \u220f\nr=1\nTwr1 (xr)\n)\n= 0. (39)\nEquation (39) generates an equation for zeroth-order terms in T a1 , from where we find that\ncab1,i(x, y) = { Aai (x), \u03c7 b(y) }\n= 1\nm2 Dbai,y\u03b4 (3)(x\u2212 y), (40)\nwhere the subscript \u201cy\u201d in the covariant derivative indicates in which space-time variable it is acting on. From the linear equation in T a1 , we can find the second coefficient of (38):\ncabc2,i (x, y, z) = 1\n2\n{\ncac1,i(x, y), \u03c7 b(z)\n}\n= gf cad\n2m4 \u03b4(3)(x\u2212 y)Dbdiz \u03b4 (3)(y \u2212 z). (41)\nPerforming the same procedure for second-order terms, we arrive at the third coefficient of the series (38)\ncabcd3,i (x, y, z, w) = 1\n3\n{\ncacd2,i (x, y, z), \u03c7 b(w)\n}\n= g2f daef ceg\n3!m6 \u03b4(3)(x\u2212 y)\u03b4(3)(y \u2212 z)Dbgi,w\u03b4 (3)(z \u2212 w). (42)\nFrom equations (40), (41) and (42), one concludes that, for k \u2265 4, the coefficients ck have the following form:\ncaw1...wkk,i = gk\u22121\nk!m2k fwkab1fwk\u22121b1b2 . . . f bk\u22122w3bk\u22121f bk\u22121w2vk\u00d7\n\u00d7 \u03b4(3) (x\u2212 x1)\n(\nk\u22121 \u220f\nj=2\n\u03b4(3) (xj \u2212 xj+1)\n)\nDw1vki,xk \u03b4 (3)(xk\u22121 \u2212 xk) (43)\nHence, the general form of the field A\u0303ai is given as follows:\nA\u0303ai (x) = A a i (x)\u2212\n1\nm2 Dbai T b 1 (x) +\n\u221e \u2211\nk=2\n\u222b\n(\nk \u220f\nr=1\nd3xr\n)\nca,w1...wki (x1, ..., xk; x)\n(\nk \u220f\nr=1\nTwr1 (wr)\n)\n= Aai (x)\u2212 1\nm2 Dbai \u03c0 b 0(x)\u2212\n\u221e \u2211\nk=2\ngk\u22121\nk!m2k Fwka...w2c\n(\nk \u220f\nr=2\n\u03c0wr0 (x)\n)\n(Dcw1i \u03c0 w1 0 (x)) (44)\nwhere Fwka...w2c = fwkab1fwk\u22121b1b2 . . . f bk\u22122w3bk\u22121f bk\u22121w2c. (45)\nWriting the series for A\u0303ai explicitly, we have\nA\u0303ai = A a i \u2212\n1\nm2 Dbai \u03c0 b 0 \u2212\ngf cad\n2m4 \u03c0b0D bd i \u03c0 c 0 \u2212\ng2f daef ceg\n3!m6 \u03c0b0\u03c0 c 0D bg i \u03c0 d 0 . . . , (46)\nwhich can also be written as\nA\u0303ai = A a i \u2212D ba i \u03be\nb \u2212 g\n2 f cad\u03bebDbdi \u03be\nc \u2212 g2\n6 f dacf ceg\u03beb\u03becDbgi \u03be d . . . , (47)\nwhere \u03bea \u2261 \u03c0a 0\nm2 . If we identify \u03bea as a Stueckelberg field [40, 41], then the expression (47)\nis the same as the obtained in [38, 39], in which they have considered a field h = eig\u03be aSa (with Sa being the generators of the gauge group SU(N)) acting on Aa\u00b5, in order to obtain an action put in a local form.\nThe fields \u03c0\u0303ai can be obtained using the same algorithm applied for the fields A\u0303 a i . Then,\nwe present the first three coefficients of the series (4) for the fields \u03c0\u0303ai , which are:\nbab1,i(x, y) = 1\nm2 gf bca\u03c0ci (y)\u03b4 3(x\u2212 y),\nbabc2,i (x, y, z) = 1\n2m4 g2f cdaf bed\u03c0ei (z)\u03b4 3(x\u2212 y)\u03b43(y \u2212 z), (48)\nbabcd3,i (x, y, z, w) = 1\n6m6 g3f deaf cgef bhg\u03c0hi (w)\u03b4 3(x\u2212 y)\u03b43(y \u2212 z)\u03b43(z \u2212 w),\nby which, with a little observation, it is possible to build up a general form of the coefficients for all k \u2265 4:\nba,w1,...,wkk,i (x, y, z, w) = gk\nk!m2k fwkbk\u22121afwk\u22121bkbk\u22121 . . . fw1vkbk\u00d7\n\u00d7 \u03c0vki (xk)\u03b4 3(x\u2212 x1)\n(\nk\u22121 \u220f\nj=2\n\u03b43(xj \u2212 xj+1)\n)\n. (49)\nHence, the results of (48) and (49) allow us to obtain the expression for the GU-corrected variable \u03c0\u0303ai :\n\u03c0\u0303ai = \u03c0 h i\n[\n\u03b4ha + gf bha\u03beb + g2\n2! f cdaf bhd\u03beb\u03bec +\ng3 3! f deaf cgef bhg\u03beb\u03bec\u03bed + . . .\n]\n, (50)\nwhere \u03bea \u2261 \u03c0a 0\nm2 . One can now check that the new fields satisfy\n{ A\u0303ai , \u03c7 b } = 0 and { \u03c0\u0303ai , \u03c7 b } = 0,\ni.e., A\u0303ai and \u03c0\u0303 a i are first class variables. By replacing (47) and (50) into (22) and (16), one can obtain the first class Hamiltonian and the first class Lagrangian, respectively.\nIV. THE SU(2) SKYRME MODEL\nWe now consider the SU(2) Skyrme model [18, 19, 25], that describes baryons and their interactions through soliton solution from the Lagrangian\nL =\n\u222b\nd3r\n[\n\u2212 F 2\u03c0 12 Tr { \u2202iU\u2202iU + } + 1 32e2 Tr {[ U+\u2202iU, U +\u2202jU ]}\n]\n, (51)\nwhere F\u03c0 is the pion decay constant, e is a dimensionless parameter and U is an SU(2) matrix. By inserting a collective coordinate A(t) into the Lagrangian above and substituting U(r)\nby U(r, t) = A(t)U(r)A+(t), we get7\nL = \u2212M + \u03bbTr { \u22020A\u22020A \u22121 } , (52)\nwhere M is the soliton mass, which, in the Skyrme ansatz U(r) = exp (iF (r) \u00b7 r\u0302), is given by\nM = 4\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndrr2\n{\n1 8 F 2\u03c0\n[\n(\n\u2202F\n\u2202r\n)2\n+ 2 sin2 F\nr2\n]\n+ 1 2e2 sin2 F r2\n[\nsin2 F\nr2 + 2\n(\n\u2202F\n\u2202r\n)2 ]}\n; (53)\n\u03bb = 2/3 (1/e3F\u03c0) \u039b, with\n\u039b =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndxx2 sin2 F\n{\n1 + 4\n[\n(\n\u2202F\n\u2202x\n)2\n+ sin2 F\nx2\n]}\n, (54)\nin which x is a dimensionless variable defined by x = eF\u03c0r. The SU(2) matrix A can be written as A = a0 + ia \u00b7 \u03c4 with the constraint\nT1 = aiai \u2212 1 \u2248 0, i = 0, 1, 2, 3. (55)\nThen, the Lagrangian (51) can be rewritten as a function of the ai\u2019s as\nL = \u2212M + 2\u03bba\u0307ia\u0307i (56)\nIn order to pass to the Hamiltonian formalism, we compute the canonical momenta, which are given by\n\u03c0i \u2261 \u2202L\n\u2202a\u0307i = 4\u03bba\u0307i, (57)\nThrough the Legendre transformation we get the canonical Hamiltonian\nHc = M + 1\n8\u03bb \u03c0i\u03c0i. (58)\nFrom the consistency condition that the constraint T1 cannot evolve in time, we obtain a secondary constraint\nT2 = ai\u03c0i \u2248 0. (59)\nThen, the total Hamiltonian is\nHT = M + 1\n8\u03bb \u03c0i\u03c0i + u1 (akak \u2212 1) + u2ai\u03c0i. (60)\nThe conservation of the constraint T2 determines the Lagrange multiplier u1:\nu1 = \u03c0i\u03c0i\n8\u03bbajaj , (61)\n7 Technical details can be found in [19]. The crucial point to be addressed here is the SU(2) group has a\nWess-Zumino term that vanishes, so it is triangle anomaly-free and the Hamiltonian admits a diagonal\nform.\nthat confirms the system possesses only two constraints, and they are second class, with Poisson algebra given by\n{Ta, Tb} = 2\u01ebabaiai, a, b = 1, 2, (62)\nwhere \u01ebab = 1. The total Hamiltonian can now be rewritten as\nHT = M + 1\n8\u03bb \u03c0i\u03c0i + \u03c0i\u03c0i 8\u03bbajaj (akak \u2212 1) + u2ai\u03c0i. (63)\nThe time evolution of the constraint T1 fixes the Lagrange multiplier u2:\nu2 = \u2212 ai\u03c0i\n4\u03bbajaj , (64)\nand the total Hamiltonian (63) becomes\nHT = M + 1\n8\u03bb\n(\n2\u2212 1\najaj\n)\n\u2212 (ai\u03c0i)\n2\n4\u03bbjajaj . (65)\nThe second class nature shown by the constraints in equation (62) allows us applying the improved gauge unfixing formalism. Now we need to choose one of the constraints to be the generator of infinitesimal transformations. The two possibilities can be analysed separately.\nT1 as first class constraint\nIn this case, we choose the constraint (55) as the generator of infinitesimal transformations, \u03c7. We can redefine it so that the two constraints form an approximate canonically conjugate pair. Thus, we reclassify T1 as\n\u03c7 = T1\n2aiai =\naiai \u2212 1\n2ajaj . (66)\nThe constraint T2 will be discarded. Therefore, the infinitesimal variations of the relevant quantities are given by\n\u03b4ai = \u03b5 {ai, \u03c7} = 0.\n\u03b4\u03c0i = \u03b5 {\u03c0i, \u03c7} = \u03b5\n(\n\u2212 ai ajaj + 2ai\u03c7 ajaj\n)\n\u03b4T2 = \u03b5 {T2, \u03c7} = \u2212\u03b5 (1 + 2\u03c7)\n(67)\nAs presented in sec. II, the first class variables are constructed as a power series of the disregarded constraint, namely\na\u0303i = ai + \u2211\nn=1\nbnT n 2 ,\n\u03c0\u0303i = \u03c0i + \u2211\nn=1\ncnT n 2 ,\n(68)\nwhere the coefficients bn and cn are calculated from (13). By using the expression (67), we can see that, for the variable a\u0303i, all coefficients bn are trivially zero. For \u03c0\u0303i, we obtain\nc1 = (2\u03c7\u2212 1) ai 2ajaj \u2212 1 . (69)\nBecause \u03b4c1 = 0, all coefficients are null for n \u2265 2. Therefore, the first class variables are\na\u0303i = ai\n\u03c0\u0303i = \u03c0i + (2\u03c7\u2212 1) ai 2ajaj \u2212 1 ak\u03c0k. (70)\nThe construction of the Hamiltonian through the new variables is essential to verify if the new system is now of the first class type. We can verify this through the Poisson brackets between the symmetry generator \u03c7 and the new Hamiltonian. By the insertion of (70) in the Hamiltonian (58), we obtain the following first-class Hamiltonian:\nH\u0303c = M + 1\n8\u03bb \u03c0\u0303i\u03c0\u0303i\n= Hc + 1\n4\u03bb\n(2\u03c7\u2212 1) (ai\u03c0i) 2\n2ajaj \u2212 1 +\n1\n8\u03bb\n[\n(2\u03c7\u2212 1) aiaj\u03c0j 2akak \u2212 1\n]2\n. (71)\nIt can now be verified that {\n\u03c7, H\u0303c\n}\n= 0, which means that \u03c7 and H\u0303c describe a gauge theory\nin this new system [5].\nT2 as first class constraint\nWe will now consider the other choice of generator of infinitesimal transformations, i.e., we will now rescale T2 as\n\u03c7\u2032 = \u2212 T2\n2aiai = \u2212 ai\u03c0i 2ajaj , (72)\nand T1 will be ignored as a constraint. \u03c7 \u2032 generates infinitesimal transformations as follows\n\u03b4ai = \u2212\u03b5 {ai, \u03c7 \u2032} = \u2212 \u03b5ai 2ajaj\n\u03b4\u03c0i = \u03b5 {\u03c0i, \u03c7 \u2032} = \u03b5\u03c0i 2ajaj + 2\u03b5\u03c7\u2032ai akak \u03b4T1 = \u03b5 {T1, \u03c7 \u2032} = \u2212\u03b5.\n(73)\nSo, both ai and \u03c0i are second class variables and must be redefined. The first class variables a\u0303i and \u03c0\u0303i are\na\u0303i = ai + \u2211\nn=1\nbnT n 1 ,\n\u03c0\u0303i = \u03c0i + \u2211\nn=1\ncnT n 1 .\n(74)\nFor both variables, we have an infinite number of coefficients, because the series do not truncate. For a\u0303i, the first two coefficients are\nb1 = \u2212 ai\n2ajaj ,\nb2 = \u2212 ai\n8 (ajaj) 2 .\n(75)\nFor n \u2265 3, the general relation is\nbn = \u2212 1 2\n( 1 2 \u2212 1 ) . . . ( 1 2 \u2212 n+ 1 )\nn!\nai (ajaj) n . (76)\nTherefore, a\u0303i becomes\na\u0303i = ai\n[\n1\u2212 (ajaj \u2212 1)\n2akak \u2212\n(ajaj \u2212 1) 2\n8 (akak) 2 + . . .\n]\n, (77)\nwhich can be put in a closed form as\na\u0303i = ai\n[\n1\u2212 (ajaj \u2212 1)\nakak\n] 1\n2 = ai\n(ajaj) 1 2\n. (78)\nNow, for the variable \u03c0\u0303i, the first two coefficients are\nc1 = \u03c0i\n2ajaj +\n2ai\u03c7 \u2032 akak ,\nc2 = 3\u03c0i\n8 (ajaj) 2 +\nai\u03c7 \u2032\n2 (akak) 2 ,\n(79)\nBy replacing the cn in the expression (74), the variable \u03c0\u0303i becomes\n\u03c0\u0303i = \u03c0i +\n(\n\u03c0i 2akak + 2ai\u03c7\n\u2032\nakak\n)\n(ajaj \u2212 1) +\n(\n3\u03c0i\n8 (akak) 2 +\nai\u03c7 \u2032\n2(akak)2\n)\n(ajaj \u2212 1) 2 . . . . (80)\nUnlike a\u0303i, one cannot obtain here a closed form to the first class variable \u03c0\u0303i. We would like to emphasize that this is a different result from the one obtained in [42].\nBy the insertion of (80) in the Hamiltonian (58), we obtain a new first class Hamiltonian:\nH\u0303 \u2032c = M + 1\n8\u03bb \u03c0\u0303i\u03c0\u0303i (81)\nIt is possible to verify that {\n\u03c7, H\u0303 \u2032c\n}\n= 0."

            "text": "In this paper, we have extended the results of the improved GU formalism [31, 32] to take into account the presence of non-Abelian variables, i.e., variables with values in the Lie algebra of a non-commutative group. The central point of this formalism is the gauge invariance restitution of dynamical systems with second-class constraints. Following an iterative procedure given in the previous sections, the second-class variables can be converted to gauge invariant quantities and then we have a gauge invariant system. In case a system has two second-class constraints, there are two ways to define the GU variables, depending on the constraint we have initially chosen to be the gauge symmetry generator. In particular, we have investigated the gauge invariance restitution for the massive SU(N) Yang-Mills model and for the SU(2) Skyrme model. In the former, the proper choice of the gauge symmetry generator allows us to reproduce exactly the infinitesimal form of the gauge variations for the case of massless Yang-Mills. The obtained expansions for the GU variables, written in terms of a power series of the discarded constraint, reproduce exactly the (non-polynomial) Stu\u0308ckelberg construction derived in previous works. On the other hand, we have obtained two different gauge theories for the SU(2) Skyrme model. For the first case (T1 as a generator, Eq. (55)), the GU variables acquire a simpler form comparing with the second case (T2 as a generator, Eq. (59)), where the respective GU variables have an infinite number of coefficients. However, these GU variables could be written in a closed form. Both systems go back to the original second-class one when we impose the initial boundary conditions. Finally, we can mention that for the massive Yang-Mills model and for the SU(2) Skyrme model, the Poisson brackets between the GU variables are equals to the Dirac brackets between the original second-class variables [32]. These results can indicate the validate of the consistency of our formalism.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Coordenac\u0327a\u0303o de Aperfeic\u0327oamento de Pessoal de N\u0301\u0131vel Superior (CAPES) and the Fundac\u0327a\u0303o de Amparo a\u0300 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) are ackknowledged for financial support.
