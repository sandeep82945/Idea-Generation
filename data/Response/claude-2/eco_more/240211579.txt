 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Conduct a more in-depth analysis on the factors influencing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) relationship between tourism carbon emissions and tourism economy. The paper suggests tourism in the Yellow River Basin is still in the early stages of EKC, so researching the drivers and thresholds of moving to the next stage could provide insights. 

2. Examine the decoupling relationship between tourism carbon emissions and tourism economy, in addition to the coupling coordination analyzed in the paper. As the tourism industry advances, understanding when and how decoupling occurs will be useful.

3. Expand the research to additional regions of China beyond the Yellow River Basin for comparison. The paper identified regional differences so comparing more regions could reveal broader insights. 

4. Develop a comprehensive indicator to assess and compare the low-carbon tourism development levels across different years and regions. The paper mentions this was lacking. A unified indicator would improve benchmarking.

5. Conduct an econometric analysis of the factors influencing regional differences in low-carbon tourism development. The paper discussed regional differences but did not statistically analyze the drivers. Spatial econometric modeling could provide more robust results.
