1. **Investigate the use of different attention mechanisms:** The paper uses a self-attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependencies in the data. However, there are other attention mechanisms that could be explored, such as non-local attention or graph attention. These mechanisms may be able to capture different aspects of the data and improve the performance of the model.


2. **Explore the use of different graph convolutional neural networks:** The paper uses a spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural network (ST-GCN) to model the relationships between the different body parts. However, there are other graph convolutional neural networks that could be explored, such as message passing neural networks or graph attention networks. These networks may be able to capture different aspects of the data and improve the performance of the model.


3. **Incorporate additional data modalities:** The paper only uses skeletal data to train the model. However, there are other data modalities that could be incorporated, such as RGB video or depth data. These additional data modalities may provide complementary information that can improve the performance of the model.


4. **Investigate the use of the model for other applications:** The paper focuses on the application of the model to tennis training action analysis. However, the model could also be applied to other applications, such as human action recognition in general or sports analysis. It would be interesting to explore the performance of the model on these other applications.


5. **Develop a real-time implementation of the model:** The paper does not discuss the real-time performance of the model. However, it would be useful to develop a real-time implementation of the model so that it can be used in real-world applications. This would allow the model to be used to provide real-time feedback to tennis players during training.
