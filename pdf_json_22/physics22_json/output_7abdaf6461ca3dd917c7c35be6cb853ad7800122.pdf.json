    "abstractText": "The permanent-electro magnetic suspension (PEMS) technology takes advantage of the attractive magnetic force between the magnet and the iron core and reduces the power consumption eventually to zero. However, the active current in the electromagnet of the zero-power PEMS system fluctuates around zero due to external disturbances and suffers from the electronic nonlinearity of the driving circuit, such as the full-bridge pulse-width-modulation (PWM) inverter. This work presents that the 2\u03bcs turnoff delay (one electronic defect) of the integrated circuit L298N (one commercial full-bridge PWM inverter produced by STMicroelectronics) leads to the nonlinear current-duty cycle characteristic, which undermines the control stability and limits the PWM frequency of the zero-power PEMS system.Moreover, the nonlinear mechanism is experimentally and theoretically analyzed for the critical PWM frequency and the sensitivity transition with respect to the 2\u03bcs turn-off delay. Besides, the critical PWM frequency is of great significance for the energy efficiency and the dynamic performance of the high-speed PEMS transportation system.

INTRODUCTION The electromagnetic suspension (EMS) technology has played an essential role in the maglev transportation industry in Germany, Japan, and China since 1960s [1]. Besides, the active magnetic bearing [2]\u2013[4] is another successful application of the EMS technology and is widely found in flywheel systems, high-speed drives, and turbomolecular pumps. However, the EMS technology consumes considerably large power to generate sufficient attractive force against the gravity [5] and requires high-performance electronics, such as the isolated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) [6]\u2013[8] and the LLC resonant converter [5], [9].\nIn 1980s, the Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet was invented as a special functional material with huge magnetic energy accumulation. Since then, the permanent-electro magnetic suspension (PEMS) technology [5], [7], [10], [11] is economically effective by using the Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Gerardo Di Martino .\nto produce the attractive force and reduce the power consumption eventually to zero [10], [12], whereas the electromagnet only plays a dynamic regulatory role [6]. Mizuno et al. [13] developed an active vibration isolation systemwith an infinite stiffness against disturbances based on the zero-power PEMS technology. Zhang et al. [14] numerically optimized the geometry for the zero-power PEMS system as undergraduate project kits in terms of the zeropower force and the controller-gain requirement. Yalcin and Erkan [10] proposed linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) structures based on H\u221e and H2 control approaches for 3-DoF micro vibration isolation with zero-power problem.\nDue to its outstanding energy-saving and robust features, the zero-power PEMS technology also attracted great attention from the maglev transportation industry. Tzeng and Wang [15] presented a rigorous dynamic analysis for the high-speed maglev transportation system with the robust zero-power PEMS strategy. Zhang et al. [6] focused on the optimal structural design of the PEMS magnet and proposed optimized parameters with better carrying capability\n37670 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

[16] reported a successful quadruple PEMS system with the improved zeropower control algorithm.\nImportantly, unlike the non-zero-mean current (I ) in the EMS technology [17], [18], the current for the zero-power PEMS technology fluctuates about zero due to external disturbances [8], [16]. Though the full-bridge pulse-widthmodulation (PWM) inverter [2] (also known as the power converter [19] or the chopper [5]) can drive the zero-mean current in the electromagnet by the PWM duty cycle (D), there are few works analyzing its electronic nonlinearity that could be of great significance for the zero-power PEMS technology.\nMoreover, the PWM frequency (fPWM ) is crucial for the dynamic performance of the high-speed PEMS transportation system, e.g., the disturbance rejection and the gap tracking [20]. In the literature, fPWM is usually set from 10 kHz to 20 kHz [5], [8], [11], [17], [18]. Generally, in order to enhance the dynamic performance of the high-speed PEMS transportation system, higher fPWM is under huge demand but may amplify the energy loss as well as the electronic nonlinearity of the full-bridge PWM inverter, which is to be discussed in the present work.\nThis work aims to analyze the electronic nonlinearity of the full-bridge PWM inverter for the zero-power PEMS system. The L298N full-bridge PWM inverter is chosen as the research target due to its wide application in low-power electronics, whereas the IGBT [6], [8] is mainly used for highpower usage. The paper starts with the mathematical model and the nonlinearity of the I \u2212D characteristic of the L298N full-bridge PWM inverter. Then, the nonlinear mechanism of the I \u2212 D characteristic is further analyzed experimentally and theoretically, especially for the critical PWM frequency (fcr ) and the sensitivity transition with respect to (w.r.t.) the 2 \u00b5s turn-off delay. Nevertheless, concluding remarks are addressed.\nII. CURRENT-DUTY CYCLE CHARACTERISTIC A. MATHEMATICAL MODEL Fig. 1 shows the electric circuit of the L298N full-bridge PWM inverter produced by STMicroelectronics. The inverter converts the PWMsignal into the current in the electromagnet that is modelled as a serial combination of an inductance (L) and a resistance (R). In1 and In2 are two TTL logic-level input ports and control the voltages at Nodes M and N, denoted as UM and UN , respectively. For example, UM \u2248 +U when In1 = HIGH, and UM \u2248 0 V when In1 = LOW. Denote the current in the electromagnet as iMN and the voltage across as uMN = UM \u2212 UN . Hence, the relationship between iMN and uMN can be expressed as,\nuMN = RiMN + LdiMN / dt, (1)\nwhere uMN is driven by the full-bridge PWM inverter and iMN varies continuously due to the inductance. Relating physical properties are summarized in Table 1.\nMoreover, Table 2 lists out three modes of the full-bridge PWM inverter with the electromagnet. When In1 6= In2, the electromagnet is either positively charged (+C) or negatively charged (\u2013C) depending on the sign of uMN ; when In1 = In2, the electromagnet is effectively short-circuited with uMN \u2248 0 V and its magnetic energy is dissipated during the discharging (DC) mode.\nMeanwhile, in Table 3, four quadrants [2] are defined according to uMN and iMN . Generally, the energy flows from the power supply into the electromagnet (|uMN | < U ) during the forwards charging (FC) mode and flows from the electromagnet into the power supply (|uMN | > U ) during the backwards charging (BC) mode.\nIn the present work, In1 is the PWM signal and In2 is obtained by the NOT gate as,\nIn1 = PWM and In2 = PWM , (2)\nwhere the PWM signal can be explicitly expressed as,\nPWM = { HIGH, nT < t < (n+ D)T LOW, (n+ D)T < t < (n+ 1)T \u2019\n(3)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 37671\nwhere T (= 1 / fPWM ) denotes the PWM period, D \u2208 [0, 1] denotes the PWM duty cycle, and n is any arbitrary integer.\nB. IDEAL SCENARIO Assuming the ideal full-bridge PWM inverter, uMN can be expressed by referring to Table 2, (2) and (3) as,\nuMN = { +U , nT < t < (n+ D)T \u2212U , (n+ D)T < t < (n+ 1)T \u00b7\n(4)\nMoreover, denote the equilibrium current at t = nT as I1 and that at t = (n+ D)T as I2. Solving (1) together with (4) gives the two equilibrium currents as, I1 = U R ( e\u2212T /\u03c4 + 1\u2212 2e\u2212(1\u2212D)T /\u03c4 )/( e\u2212T /\u03c4 \u2212 1 ) I2 =\nU R\n( 2e\u2212DT /\u03c4 \u2212 e\u2212T /\u03c4 \u2212 1 )/( e\u2212T /\u03c4 \u2212 1 ) ,\n(5)\nwhere \u03c4 = L / R denotes the time constant of the electromagnet. Hence, (5) indicates that iMN fluctuates between I1 and I2.\nAssuming \u03c4 to be much larger than T , i.e., T / \u03c4 1, (5)\ncan be approximated as,\niMN \u2248 I1 \u2248 I2 \u2248 U R (2D\u2212 1) \u2208\n[ \u2212U / R,U / R ] , (6)\nwhich indicates that ideal iMN in the electromagnet is linear with the duty cycle for a high fPWM .\nC. NONLINEARITY Fig. 2 shows the experiment rig for the iMN \u2212D characteristic of the L298N full-bridge PWM inverter. iMN is measured by the ammeter, uMN is measured by the oscilloscope, whereas the PWM signal is generated by the pulse generator.\nFig. 3(a) visualizes the variations of iMN w.r.t. D for fPWM= 0.1, 1, 10, 100kHz. It is observed that the characteristic iMN \u2212 D curve, e.g., iMN = fI (D), is an odd function about Point (0.5, 0) as,\nfI (1\u2212 D) = \u2212fI (D) . (7)\nAlso, the characteristic iMN \u2212 D curve deviates from the ideal scenario in (6), and the deviation increases with the increase of fPWM .\nMoreover, define the sensitivity of iMN w.r.t. D as, S = diMN / dD. (8)\nFig. 3(b) visualizes the variations of S w.r.t. D. It is observed that S at D = 0.5 decreases with the increase of fPWM (as low as 70 mA for 100 kHz), whereas the four sensitivity curves converge to around 1700 mA for D < 0.3 and D > 0.7. In other words, with the increase of fPWM , the accumulation of the magnetic energy around D = 0.5 is weaken.\nFurthermore, since F is linear with iMN [14], the large sensitivity change about the zero current (e.g., around 1700/70 \u2248 24.3 times for 100 kHz) will significantly undermine the control stability of the zero-power PEMS system.\nIII. NONLINEAR ANALYSIS This section analyzes the nonlinear mechanism of the iMN\u2212D characteristic for the electromagnet driven by the L298N fullbridge PWM inverter. Firstly, the voltage dynamics is investigated for two fPWM (one ultra-high and one ultra-low) and D = 0.5. Secondly, DC, FC and BC modes are respectively characterized. Thirdly, the critical PWM frequency (fcr ) is modelled from the energy perspective. Fourthly, the sensitivity transition is analyzed w.r.t. fcr .\nA. VOLTAGE DYNAMICS 1) fPWM = 100 kHz (ULTRA-HIGH) Fig. 4 visualizes the whole-period variations of In1, In2, UM , UN , and uMN for fPWM = 100 kHz and D = 0.5 w.r.t. the time (t). It is observed that the dynamic responses of In1 and In2 are so fast that the step change is completed in less than 0.1 \u00b5s, the rising and falling step changes of UM and UN are completed in 0.2 \u00b5s and 1 \u00b5s, respectively. However, by\n37672 VOLUME 10, 2022\ncomparing Figs. 4(a-b), there is a significant delay for around 2 \u00b5s between the falling step changes of UM (or UN ) and In1 (or In2), which is referred to as the turn-off delay in the datasheet of the L298N full-bridge PWM inverter produced by STMicroelectronics. Therefore, the 2 \u00b5s turn-off delay results in the DC mode as defined in Table 2 and highlighted in Fig. 4(c).\n2) fPWM = 100 Hz (ULTRA-LOW) Fig. 5 visualizes the whole-period variation of uMN for fPWM = 100 Hz and D = 0.5 w.r.t. t . Since the 2 \u00b5s turn-off delay is negligible compared with the 10ms PWMperiod, the variations of In1, In2, UM , and UN are trivial and not shown. As defined in Table 3, the BC and FC modes are separated by the boundaries at uMN = \u00b112V in Fig. 5.\nB. ELECTRONIC CHARACTERISTIC"

However, the BC mode (uMN > +12V) occurs\nimmediately after the DC mode for fPWM = 5 and 10 kHz, whereas the FC mode (uMN < +12V) occurs for fPWM = 20, 50, and 100 kHz. Technically, the energy-dissipation capability of the DC mode is finite in the 2 \u00b5s duration. Therefore, the immediate occurrence of the FC mode indicates that the magnetic energy is entirely dissipated by the DC mode for fPWM = 20, 50, and 100 kHz, whereas the magnetic energy exceeds the energy-dissipation capability of the DC mode for fPWM = 5 and 10 kHz."

Moreover, it is observed that the curves for fPWM = 2, 10, and 20 Hz have a long BC mode for around 5 ms and a long FC mode for around 9 ms, and fluctuate around +10 V afterwards. On the contrary, the curves for fPWM = 50, 100, and 200 Hz have shorter BCmode and falls out of the scope before reaching +10 V.\nTechnically, the charging characteristic is determined by the power supply (e.g., supply voltage and inner resistance) and the electromagnet (e.g., inductance and resistance). Therefore, the saturation at uMN = \u00b110V indicates that the electromagnet is entirely charged by the FC mode for fPWM = 2, 10, and 20 Hz but is partially charged due to the insufficient duration for fPWM = 50, 100, and 200 Hz.

And, the energy balance equation can be\nexpressed as,\nEFC = EDC + EBC , (9)\nwhere EFC , EDC , and EBC denote the charged energy by the FC mode and the dissipated energies by the DC and BC modes, respectively.\nMoreover, assuming T \u03c4 , EFC , EDC , and EBC can be linearized and approximated as,\nEFC = eFCTFC ,EDC = eDCTDC ,EBC = eBCTBC , (10)\nwhere eFC , eDC , and eBC denote the energy-charging rate by the FC mode, and the energy-dissipating rates by the DC and BC modes, respectively.\nAssuming TDC > 0, substituting (10) into (9) gives, TFC / TDC = ( eBC / eFC ) ( TBC / TDC ) + eDC / eFC , (11)\nwhich is in the first-order form, i.e., y = ax + b, where y = TFC / TDC , x = TBC / TDC , a = eBC / eFC , and b = eDC / eFC .\nBy substituting (x, y) associated with fPWM = 1, 2, 5, and 10 kHz in Table 4 into (11), (a, b) can be solved by the least square method as,\na = eBC / eFC= 7.46 and b = eDC / eFC= 15.33, (12)\nwhich indicates that the energy-dissipating rate by the DC mode is around twice as much as that by the BC mode. Therefore, the DCmode gradually replaces the BCmodewith the increase of fPWM , which leads to the lower sensitivity as well as the larger energy loss for D = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 3(b).\nFurthermore, fcr is defined as the vanishing point of the BC regime (TBC = 0) for D = 0.5 and can be expressed from (11) as,\nfcr = 1\nTFC + TDC = 1( 1+ eDC / eFC ) 1 TDC , (13)\nwhich gives fcr= 15.28 kHz.

The red background indicates\niMN > 0, the blue background indicates iMN < 0, and the green background indicates iMN \u2248 0.\nBy referring to Table 6 and Table 7, the variations of S can be characterized into three zones from the energy perspective:\nVOLUME 10, 2022 37675\n\u2022 Low-sensitivity zone(Stages I, II, and III, between the cyan dotted lines): Both +FC and \u2013FC modes co-exist, which indicates that the magnetic energy stored during the FC mode (both positive and negative) is completely dissipated by the DC or BC mode. Hence, the lowsensitivity zone is dominated by the energy cancellation between the FC and BC modes for fPWM < fcr and between the FC and DC modes for fPWM > fcr . Besides, since the energy-dissipating rate by the DC mode is larger than that by the BC mode in (12), the sensitivity for D = 0.5 decreases with the increase of fPWM . \u2022 Sensitivity-transition zone(Stage IV, between the purple and cyan dotted lines): The 2 \u00b5s DC mode has a finite energy-dissipation capability and buffers the sensitivity transition until the capability is entirely consumed, as outlined by the purple and cyan dotted lines. Therefore, the sensitivity transition expends with the increase of fPWM . \u2022 High-sensitivity zone (Stage V, outside the purple dotted lines): The expending of the FC regime and the shrinking of the BC regime occur simultaneously with the increase of the duty cycle, whereas the current in the electromagnet does not change the direction. Therefore, the magnetic energy accumulates more effectively and the corresponding sensitivity is larger in the highsensitivity zone than those in the low-sensitivity zone.\nIV. CONCLUSION The present work investigates into the electronic nonlinear of the L298N full-bridge PWM inverter for the zeropower PEMS system. Based on the experimental observation and the theoretical analysis, we can draw the following conclusions: \u2022 In micro level, it is observed that the L298N full-bridge PWM inverter possesses a 2 \u00b5s turn-off delay that leads to the passive DCmode; in macro level, such a tiny delay results in the nonlinear iMN \u2212 D characteristic.\n\u2022 With the increase of fPWM , the relative portion of the 2\u00b5s DC mode is significantly amplified and the DC mode replaces the BC mode entirely at fcr = 15.28 kHz and D = 0.5, which is theoretically modelled from the energy perspective. \u2022 Since the energy-dissipating rate by the DC mode is around twice as much as that by the BC mode, the sensitivity as well as the energy efficiency at D = 0.5 decrease with the increase of fPWM . \u2022 The sensitivity transition results from the finite energydissipation capability of the 2 \u00b5s DC mode and expends with the increase of fPWM . \u2022 A full-bridge PWM inverter with a lower turn-off delay will result in a higher fcr and be more preferable, such as CM75TF-12H (IGBT produced by MITSUBISHI, with a 0.2 \u00b5s turn-off delay)[8]. \u2022 Though higher fPWM can enhance the dynamic performance of the high-speed PEMS transportation system [20], a slightly smaller fPWM than fcr is more\npreferable due to the higher energy efficiency and the gentler sensitivity transition, whereas the suitable compensation measures are necessary to take care of the nonlinear iMN \u2212 D characteristic, e.g., the bias current [3], [17] and the close-loop current control [2], [4], [7], [8], [10], [11].\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nREFERENCES [1] H.-W.
