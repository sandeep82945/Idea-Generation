Patients were randomised to HOT- HMV or HOT. In addition to clinical data, healthcare utilisation, exacerbation frequency and quality- oflife data were collected at each follow- up visit (6 weeks then 3, 6 and 12 months). A detailed description of quality- adjusted life- year (QALY) calculations is provided in online supplemental eMethods. Medical resource utilisation was recorded throughout the trial at routine follow- up, which was reported by patients and verified by electronic health records, where possible. The economic analysis was conducted over 12 months, reflecting the clinical trial. Costs were calculated from 2017 tariff data from a National Health Service perspective\nP rotected by copyright.\non January 8, 2024 at Indian Institute of T echnology P atna (IIT P atna). http://thorax.bm j.com /\nebruary 2023.

For all other cost categories, 1- year costs per patient were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group, including average 1- year total primary and secondary care physician visits (\u00a35947 (95% CI \u00a34394 to \u00a37586) vs \u00a38275 (95% CI \u00a36428 to \u00a310 122)); medication costs (\u00a390 (95% CI \u00a352 to \u00a3127) vs \u00a3104 (95% CI \u00a361 to \u00a3146)) and costs for the treatment of exacerbations (\u00a34679 (95% CI \u00a32866 to \u00a36493) vs \u00a35821 (95% CI \u00a34089 to \u00a37552)).

The average number of QALYs was 0.36 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.45) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.39) for the intervention group and control group, respectively.

Bootstrap iterations indicated that at \u00a320 000 and \u00a330 000/QALY, the probability that HOT- HMV is cost- effective versus HOT alone is 56% and 61%, respectively (figure 2A). At \u00a330 000/QALY, the probability that HOT- HMV is more costly and more effective than HOT is 45% (figure 2B).

            "text": "HMV is increasingly used to treat chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.4 A few publications have examined the costeffectiveness of HMV, with existing economic evaluation largely confined to different HMV modes or setup strategies.5\u20137 HOT- HMV has previously demonstrated clinical effectiveness, increasing admission- free survival (time to hospital readmission or death) in patients with COPD following a life- threatening exacerbation requiring acute non- invasive ventilation.3 Our study demonstrates that HOT- HMV is cost- effective, with the upper limit of cost per QALY falling below \u00a320 000. This result is consistent with previously conducted analyses using Markov models, which suggest a cost per QALY of \u00a311 318 with a 99% chance of being cost- effective at the \u00a320 000 threshold.8 9 The cost per QALY of HOT- HMV falls below that considered acceptable for interventions in the UK10 and compares favourably with other interventions commonly used in COPD (figure 3).\nTable 1 Cost- effectiveness results for home non- invasive mechanical ventilation (HMV) with home oxygen therapy (HOT) versus HOT alone (intention- to- treat analysis)"

            "text": "The efficacy trial included a small population with a completion rate (64/116) limited principally by patient death (35/116), which was numerically but not statistically larger in the HOTalone group. The cost- effectiveness analysis accounts for the lower completion rates as death significantly impacts QALY. Of the patients who withdrew, most (>70%) were in the HOT- alone group. The the most common withdrawal reason was disease progression, which is associated with worse quality of life and so would favour the control arm rather than the intervention.\nAll centres contributing data to the efficacy trial had established HMV services; therefore, it is possible that less established centres would take longer to set up HMV and would thus increase costs with HOT- HMV. Recent data have demonstrated outpatient setup of HMV in COPD not only is feasible but may be more cost- effective than inpatient titration,5 although this was not the case on a recent study of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.11\nThe trial design allowed patients initially allocated to HOT alone to have HMV if they breached safety criteria after reaching the primary outcome. As expected, the high number of cross- over patients diluted the impact on quality of life between intervention and control arm as these control arm patients were in poorer health than the HOT patients who did not cross- over. Importantly, an additional and modified per- protocol analysis showed increased ICERs compared with ITT (online supplemental eResults).\nFinally, the health economic analysis required simplifications. The use of average costs of medical resources does not necessarily reflect actual individual healthcare expenditures but provides typical costs for the patient population. Furthermore, the use of QALYs as an effectiveness measure necessitates breaking the multidimensional construct of quality of life into one value. However, this approach is consistent with other research.12"
