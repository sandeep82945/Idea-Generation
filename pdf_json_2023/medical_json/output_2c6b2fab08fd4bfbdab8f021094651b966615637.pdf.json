            "text": "During the initiation of invasive aspergillosis, inhaled Aspergillus fumigatus conidia are 19 deposited on the epithelial cells lining the bronchi, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli. While the 20 interactions of A. fumigatus with bronchial and type II alveolar cell lines have been investigated 21 in vitro, little is known about the interactions of this fungus with terminal bronchiolar epithelial 22 cells. We compared the interactions of A. fumigatus with the A549 type II alveolar epithelial cell 23 line and the HSAEC1-KT human small airway epithelial (HSAE) cell line. We found that A. 24 fumigatus conidia were poorly endocytosed by A549 cells, but avidly endocytosed by HSAE 25 cells. A. fumigatus germlings invaded both cell types by induced endocytosis, but not by active 26 penetration. A549 cell endocytosis of A. fumigatus was independent of fungal viability, more 27 dependent on host microfilaments than microtubules, and induced by A. fumigatus CalA 28 interacting with host cell integrin \u03b15\u03b21. By contrast, HSAE cell endocytosis required fungal 29 viability, was more dependent on microtubules than microfilaments, and did not require CalA or 30 integrin \u03b15\u03b21. HSAE cells were more susceptible than A549 cells to damage caused by direct 31 contact with killed A. fumigatus germlings and by secreted fungal products. In response to A. 32 fumigatus infection, A549 cells secreted a broader profile of cytokines and chemokines than 33 HSAE cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that studies of HSAE cells provide 34 complementary data to A549 cells and thus represent a useful model for probing the 35 interactions of A. fumigatus with bronchiolar epithelial cells in vitro. 36 37 38\nImportance 39 During the initiation of invasive aspergillosis, Aspergillus fumigatus invades, damages, and 40 stimulates the epithelial cells that line the airways and alveoli. Previous studies of A. fumigatus-41 epithelial cell interactions in vitro have used either large airway epithelial cell lines or the A549 42 type II alveolar epithelial cell line. The interactions of fungi with terminal bronchiolar epithelial 43 cells have not been investigated. Here, we compared the interactions of A. fumigatus with A549 44 cells and the Tert-immortalized human small airway epithelial HSAEC1-KT (HSAE) cell line. We 45 discovered that A. fumigatus invades and damages these two cell lines by distinct mechanisms. 46 Also, the proinflammatory responses of the cell lines to A. fumigatus are different. These results 47 provide insight into how A. fumigatus interacts with different types of epithelial cells during 48 invasive aspergillosis and demonstrate that HSAE cells are useful in vitro model for 49 investigating the interactions of this fungus with bronchiolar epithelial cells. 50 51 Keywords Aspergillus fumigatus, alveolar epithelial cell, small airway epithelial cell, 52 endocytosis, host cell damage, cytokine, chemokine 53\nIntroduction 54 Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic fungus that grows in decaying organic and plant materials 55 (1). It produces airborne spores (asexual conidia) with a diameter of 2-3 \u00b5m that are small 56 enough to reach the lower respiratory tract when inhaled (2). In healthy individuals, inhaled 57 conidia are quickly cleared by alveolar microphages and neutrophils (3, 4). In susceptible 58 individuals, inhaled conidia that are not eliminated by these host defenses can adhere to and 59 invade the airways and alveoli, causing invasive aspergillosis (IA). Even with antifungal 60 treatment, this disease remains associated with high morbidity and mortality (5-9). Risk factors 61 for IA include prolonged neutropenia, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, solid organ transplantation, 62 and small molecule inhibitors of myeloid function. Infections with respiratory viruses such as 63 influenza and SARS-CoV-2 that damage the airway epithelium are also a risk factor for IA (10). 64 Pulmonary epithelial cells are central to the pathogenesis of IA. After A. fumigatus conidia 65 are inhaled, they are deposited in the bronchi, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli. In susceptible 66 hosts, A. fumigatus conidia progressively form swollen conidia, germlings, and finally mature 67 hyphae, which adhere to, invade and damage host cells (5, 11). A. fumigatus conidia and 68 germlings have been found to invade pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro by induced endocytosis 69 (11-18). Most studies on the pathogenesis of IA have used the A549 type II alveolar epithelial 70 cell line and the BEAS-2B or 16HBE bronchial cell lines (13, 16, 19-22). Although the small 71 airway epithelial cells that line the terminal bronchioles are likely key targets of A. fumigatus 72 during the development of IA, this type of epithelial cell has been studied only in the context of 73 viral infections (23-26). It is important to study bronchiolar epithelial cells because they are 74 transcriptionally and functionally distinct from alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells (27-29). 75 Previously, we found that integrin \u03b15\u03b21 binds to the A. fumigatus CalA invasin and induces 76 fungal endocytosis by A549 cells (16). In the corticosteroid treated mouse model of IA, a \u0394calA 77 mutant exhibits reduced invasion of the alveolar epithelium but wild-type levels of invasion of 78 bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells. These results suggest that A. fumigatus interacts 79\ndifferently with alveolar epithelial cells as compared to other pulmonary epithelial cells. To 80 investigate this possibility, we analyzed the interactions of A. fumigatus with A549 cells and the 81 Tert-immortalized human small airway epithelial HSAEC1-KT (HSAE) cell line. We discovered 82 that A. fumigatus invades and damages these two different cell lines by distinct mechanisms 83 and that the proinflammatory responses of the two cell lines to A. fumigatus also differ. These 84 results provide insight into how A. fumigatus interacts with different types of pulmonary epithelial 85 cells during the initiation of IA and indicate that HSAE cells are a useful in vitro model for 86 investigating the interactions of this fungus with the epithelial cells that line the terminal 87 bronchioles. 88 89 RESULTS 90 A. fumigatus interacts with both alveolar epithelial cells and small airway epithelial 91 cells during IA in mice. To confirm that A. fumigatus interacts with small airway epithelial cells 92 during the initiation of IA, mice were immunosuppressed with cortisone acetate and then 93 intratracheally inoculated with 107 conidia of A. fumigatus Af293. After 12 h infection, the lungs 94 were harvested after which thin sections of the lungs were stained with Gomori methenamine 95 silver to visualize the fungi. We observed that the conidia and germinating hyphae were 96 deposited along the entire respiratory tree, including the bronchi, small airways, terminal 97 bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 1A). These findings suggest that A. fumigatus likely interacts with 98 multiple types of pulmonary epithelial cells, including small airway epithelial cells, during the 99\ninitiation of IA. 100 A. fumigatus invades A549 alveolar epithelial cells and HSAE small airway epithelial 101 cells by different mechanisms. To investigate the interactions of A. fumigatus with epithelial 102 cells from the alveoli and the terminal bronchioles in vitro, we used the A549 type II alveolar 103 epithelial cell line and the HASE human small airway epithelial cell line. We first examined how 104 A. fumigatus germlings invade these cell lines using two well characterized A. fumigatus clinical 105\nisolates, strains Af293 and CEA10. By scanning electron microscopy, we observed that A549 106 cells preferentially endocytosed the proximal portion of the hyphae, adjacent to the conidia (Fig. 107 1B). By contrast, HSAE cells endocytosed either the tip of the hyphae or the entire germling, 108 suggesting that the mechanism by which A549 and HSAE cells endocytose A. fumigatus may 109 be different (Fig. 1C). 110 Conidia and germlings are the two major morphotypes of A. fumigatus that interact with 111 epithelial cells during early IA development. We used our standard differential fluorescent assay 112 to quantify the endocytosis of A. fumigatus conidia and germlings by A549 and HSAE cells. We 113 found that although A549 cells endocytosed few conidia (Fig. 2A), they avidly endocytosed 114 germlings (Fig. 2B). The number of organisms that remained associated with A549 cells after 115 washing, a measure of adherence, was similar for conidia and germlings. HSAE cells 116 responded differently, endocytosing more conidia than germlings (Fig. 2C and D). However, 117 conidia and germlings adhered similarly to these cells. The differences between A549 and 118 HSAE cells were observed with both strains Af293 and CEA10, suggesting that the two types of 119 pulmonary epithelial cells endocytose different A. fumigatus morphotypes by different 120 mechanisms. 121 A. fumigatus PacC is a pH responsive transcription factor and a \u0394pacC mutant is defective 122\nin invading A549 cells (13). To examine the role of PacC in governing invasion of HASE cells, 123 we constructed a pacC gene deletion mutant and corresponding complemented strain in the 124 Af293 strain background. As previously reported, both conidia and germlings of the \u0394pacC 125\nmutant were endocytosed very poorly by A549 cells and this invasion defect was restored with 126 the \u0394pacC+pacC complemented strain (Fig. 2A and B). The \u0394pacC mutant also had modestly 127\nreduced adherence to A549 cells. Although HSAE cells endocytosed germlings of the \u0394pacC 128\nmutant poorly, they endocytosed \u0394pacC conidia better than wild-type conidia (Fig. 2C and D). 129\nAlso, deletion of pacC had no effect on adherence to HSAE cells. These results indicate that 130\nalthough PacC is a positive regulator of conidial surface proteins that induce endocytosis by 131 A549 cells, it is a negative regulator of conidial surface proteins that induce endocytosis by 132 HSAE cells. Also, PacC positively regulates of expression of A. fumigatus surface proteins that 133 mediate the endocytosis of germlings by both types of epithelial cells. 134 A. fumigatus invades A549 and HSAE cells by induced endocytosis. Some fungi such 135 as Candida albicans can invade host cells by both induced endocytosis and active penetration, 136 in which progressively elongating hyphae physically push their way into host cells (30). To 137 determine if active penetration occurs during A. fumigatus invasion, we performed the invasion 138 assay using A549 and HSAE cells that had been fixed with paraformaldehyde prior to infection 139 thereby preventing induced endocytosis. We found that there was no A. fumigatus invasion of 140 killed A549 cells or HASE cells by Af293 or CEA10 germlings (Fig. 3A and B). Killing A549 cells 141 resulted in a modest reduction in A. fumigatus adherence, but killing HSAE cells had no effect 142 on this interaction. These data indicate that A. fumigatus germlings invade alveolar epithelial 143 cells and small airway epithelial cells only by induced endocytosis and not active penetration. 144 Thus, fungal invasin(s) and host cell receptor(s) are crucial for A. fumigatus to induce its own 145 endocytosis by both types of pulmonary epithelial cells. 146 Microfilaments and microtubules play different roles in the endocytosis of A. 147 fumigatus by A549 cells vs. HSAE cells. Previously, we found that A. fumigatus is 148 endocytosed by A549 cells via an actin-dependent mechanism and that inhibiting polymerization 149 of actin microfilaments with cytochalasin D reduces fungal endocytosis by A549 cells (16). To 150 compare the role of actin in the endocytosis of A. fumigatus by A549 and HSAE cells, we 151 infected the cells with A. fumigatus germlings and then stained F-actin with ActinRed 555. We 152 observed that actin filaments accumulated around the invading fungal cells in both A549 and 153 HSAE cells (Fig. 4A and 4B). However, there appeared to be more prominent actin 154 accumulation around A. fumigatus in A549 cells relative to HSAE cells. This pattern was 155 observed with both A. fumigatus Af293 and CEA10. 156\nTo determine the functional significance of the actin accumulation, we investigated the 157 effects of treating A549 and HSAE cells with cytochalasin D. Consistent with our previous 158 results (16), treatment of A549 cells cytochalasin D reduced the endocytosis of strain Af293 by 159 67% and the endocytosis of strain CEA10 by 33% (Fig. 4C). It had less effect on HSAE cells, 160 reducing the endocytosis of strain Af293 by only 33% and not significantly decreasing the 161 endocytosis of strain CEA10. We also tested the effects of the microtubule polymerization 162 inhibitor, colchicine on the endocytosis of A. fumigatus. We found that while treatment of A549 163 cells with colchicine inhibited endocytosis of strains Af293 and CEA10 by about 40%, it reduced 164 the endocytosis of both strains by HSAE cells by approximately 80% (Fig. 4D). Neither 165 cytochalasin D nor colchicine altered the adherence of A. fumigatus to either cell line (Fig. S1) 166 Collectively, these findings indicate that A. fumigatus endocytosis by A549 cells is largely 167 dependent on actin microfilaments whereas endocytosis by HASE cells is mainly dependent on 168 microtubules. 169 Killed A. fumigatus germlings are endocytosed differently by A549 and HSAE cells. 170 Next, we investigated whether fungal viability is required for A. fumigatus to adhere to and be 171 endocytosed by A549 and HSAE cells. A. fumigatus germlings were killed with the metabolic 172 poison, thimerosal to avoid modifying cell surface ligands. Although killing Af293 germlings 173 decreased their endocytosis by A549 cells by 30%, killing CEA10 germling had no significant 174 effect on their endocytosis (Fig. 5A). Killed organism of both strains had no effect of adherence 175 to A549 cells. By contrast, killing germlings of either strain resulted in an 87-89% reduction in 176 endocytosis by HSAE cells, and slightly increased their adherence (Fig. 5B). Thus, endocytosis 177 of A. fumigatus by A549 cells is largely independent of fungal viability, whereas endocytosis by 178 HSAE cells is highly dependent on a factor(s) associated with fungal viability. 179 A. fumigatus endocytosis by A549 cells and HSAE cells is mediated by different 180 fungal invasins and host receptors. Our previous studies with A549 cells showed that the 181 endocytosis of A. fumigatus is mediated in part by the interaction of the fungal CalA invasin with 182\nthe host cell receptor, integrin \u03b15\u03b21 (16). We investigated whether A. fumigatus induces its own 183 endocytosis by HSAE cells via the same mechanism. Although the \u0394calA mutant had 184 significantly reduced endocytosis by A549 cells, it was endocytosed by HSAE cells to levels 185 similar to the wild-type strain (Fig. 6A). The \u0394calA mutant exhibited wild-type adherence to both 186 cell lines (Fig. S2A). As we have shown previously, blocking integrin \u03b21 and integrin \u03b15 with 187 specific monoclonal antibodies reduced the endocytosis of A. fumigatus in A549 cells, however 188 this was not observed with HSAE cells (Fig. 6B). Neither of these antibodies inhibited the 189 adherence of A. fumigatus to either cell line (Fig. S2B). To verify this result, we constructed 190 A549 and HSAE cell lines in which ITGA5 was deleted and in which integrin \u03b15 was no longer 191 expressed (Fig. 6C). Consistent with the antibody inhibition data, deletion of ITGA5 decreased 192 the endocytosis of A. fumigatus by A549 cells but not by HSAE cells and had no effect on 193 adherence to either cell line (Fig. 6D and S2C). Thus, the interactions of A. fumigatus CalA with 194 integrin \u03b15\u03b21 induces endocytosis by A549 cells, but not HSAE cells. 195 Additional receptors have been reported to mediate the endocytosis of A. fumigatus 196 germlings by A549 cells including E-cadherin and Dectin-1 (13, 18). We investigated whether 197 these receptors are also required for HSAE cells to endocytose A. fumigatus germlings. 198 Knockdown of E-cadherin with siRNA significantly reduced the endocytosis of A. fumigatus by 199 both types of epithelial cells and reduced adherence to A549 cells but not HSAE cells (Fig. 6 E 200 and S2D). By contrast, a neutralizing anti-Dectin-1 antibody significantly inhibited the 201 endocytosis of A. fumigatus by A549 cells but had no detectable effect on endocytosis by HSAE 202 cells (Fig. 6F). This antibody did not alter adherence to either cell type (Fig. S2E). Collectively, 203 these results indicate that although E-cadherin is required for the maximal endocytosis of A. 204 fumigatus by both A549 cells and HSAE cells, Dectin-1 is only required for endocytosis by A549 205 cells. The finding that siRNA knockdown of E-cadherin resulted in only a modest decrease in 206 endocytosis by HSAE cells suggests that additional, as yet undefined receptors must mediate 207 the endocytosis of A. fumigatus by HSAE cells. 208\nA. fumigatus damages A549 and HSAE cells by distinct mechanisms. A. fumigatus 209 causes significant damage to host cells and we have found that the capacity of A. fumigatus 210 mutants to damage A549 cells in vitro directly correlates with their virulence in the 211 immunosuppressed mouse model of IA (13, 16, 31, 32). We compared the capacity of A. 212 fumigatus to damage A549 cells and HSAE cells using our standard 51Cr release assay (13, 32). 213 Using strains Af293 and CEA10, we found that live A. fumigatus caused less damage to A549 214 cells relative to HSAE cells (Fig. 7A and B). When the epithelial cells were incubated with 215 germlings that had been killed with either thimerosal or paraformaldehyde, the extent of damage 216 to both cell types was significantly reduced. However, killed germlings, especially those of strain 217 Af293 caused significantly more damage to HSAE cells than to A549 cells. To investigate the 218 role of soluble factor in A. fumigatus with the epithelial cells, we incubated them with filtrates 219 from cultures of A. fumigatus cells grown in tissue culture medium for 48 h. Although filtrates 220 prepared from cultures of strain Af293 caused more damage to HSAE cells than A549 cells the 221 first 6 h of exposure, these filtrates killed all of the HSAE and A549 cells by 24 h (Fig. 7C). 222 Culture filtrates prepared from strain CEA10 caused no detectable damage either HSAE or 223 A549 cells for the first 6 h of incubation. However, they caused a modest amount of damage to 224 HSAE cells and no detectable damage to A549 cells after 24 h (Fig. 7D). Collectively, these 225 results suggest that HSAE cells are more susceptible than A549 cells to damage caused by 226 direct contact with both live and killed A. fumigatus cells and by products that are secreted by 227 this fungus. These data also indicate that under the conditions used for these assays, although 228 live cells of strain Af293 damaged epithelial cells similarly to strain CEA10, killed germlings and 229 culture filtrates of strain Af239 caused greater epithelial cell damage than the other strain. 230 A. fumigatus infection stimulates different pro-inflammatory responses in A549 and 231 HSAE cells. Pulmonary epithelial cells play a central role in orchestrating the host defense 232 against pulmonary pathogens by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that 233 attract and activate professional phagocytes that kill the invading microorganism (33-36). To 234\ncompare the inflammatory responses of A549 and HSAE cells to A. fumigatus, we infected them 235 for 24 h with conidia of two different strains of A. fumigatus and measured the levels of 8 236 cytokines and chemokines using a Luminex Multiplex Array. We observed different patterns of 237 response that varied with the type of pulmonary epithelial cell. A. fumigatus infection stimulated 238 both A549 cells and HSAE cells to secrete increased amounts of CXCL8 and IL-6 relative to 239 uninfected cells, but A549 cells secreted greater amounts of these pro-inflammatory mediators 240 than HSAE cells (Fig. 8). While A. fumigatus stimulated A549 cells to secrete TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, 241 and CCL2, the secretion of these mediators by HSAE cells was undetectable in both infected 242 and uninfected cells. A. fumigatus stimulated both A549 cells and HSAE cells to secrete similar 243 amounts of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. CXCL1 secretion was induced by infection of HSAE cells, but not 244 A549 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that while both cell types can potentially influence 245 the host immune response to A. fumigatus, A549 cells produce a greater repertoire of cytokines 246 and chemokines than HSAE cells. 247 248\nDiscussion 249 During the initiation of IA, inhaled A. fumigatus conidia likely interact with the pulmonary 250 epithelial cells that line the entire respiratory tree, including terminal bronchiolar epithelial cells 251 and alveolar epithelial cells. In this study, we determined that A. fumigatus interacts differently 252 with these two types of pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro (Summarized in Table S1). One major 253 difference was the degree of endocytosis of conidia by the two different cell lines. While A549 254 cells endocytosed conidia poorly, HASE cells avidly endocytosed this morphotype. Also, fewer 255 \u0394pacC conidia were endocytosed by A549 cells relative to wild-type conidia, whereas more 256 \u0394pacC conidia than wild-type conidia were endocytosed by HSAE cells. These results suggest 257 that different receptor-ligand interactions induce conidial endocytosis by A549 cells as 258 compared to HSAE cells. 259\nPreviously, it has been reported that A549 cells avidly endocytosis A. fumigatus conidia, in 260 contrast to the results presented here (13, 22, 37). A key difference is that the previous 261 endocytosis assays were performed in the presence of serum, whereas the current ones were 262 performed in serum-free media to better mimic the conditions to which the fungus is exposed in 263 vivo. Nevertheless, the finding that serum enhances the endocytosis of A. fumigatus suggests 264 that serum proteins may function as bridging molecules between conidia and alveolar epithelial 265 cells, and thereby induce endocytosis. Recently, we found that high molecular weight kininogen 266 and vitronectin in human serum can act as bridging molecules between yeast-phase Candida 267 spp. and vascular endothelial cells (38). Whether these proteins can also function as bridging 268 molecules between A. fumigatus conidia and alveolar epithelial cells is currently unknown. 269 C. albicans can invade oral epithelial cells by two distinct mechanisms, active penetration 270 and induced endocytosis (30, 39, 40). Induced endocytosis occurs when the C. albicans 271 invasins, Als3 and Ssa1 interact with multiple oral epithelial cell receptors, including E-cadherin, 272 the epidermal growth factor receptor, HER2, and the ephrin type-A receptor 2 (39-43). This 273 process requires intact microfilaments (44). We determined that A. fumigatus germlings invade 274 A549 cells and HASE cells only by induced endocytosis and not by active penetration. However, 275 the mechanisms of induced endocytosis by A549 cells and HSAE cell are different. Endocytosis 276 of A. fumigatus by A549 cells is similar to the endocytosis of C. albicans by oral epithelial cells 277 in that it is mediated in part by E-cadherin, does not require fungal viability and is highly 278 dependent on host microfilaments. Unlike the endocytosis of C. albicans, endocytosis of A. 279 fumigatus by A549 cells is induced by Dectin-1 and by CalA interacting with host cell integrin 280 \u03b15\u03b21 (16). By contrast, HSAE cell endocytosis is different from epithelial cell endocytosis of C. 281 albicans in that it requires fungal viability, is more dependent on microtubules than 282 microfilaments, and minimally dependent on E-cadherin. HSAE cell endocytosis of A. fumigatus 283 also differs from that of A549 cells because it independent of CalA, integrin \u03b15\u03b21, and Dectin-1. 284\nThe mechanisms by which A. fumigatus induces its own endocytosis by HSAE cells is currently 285 unknown but is topic of active investigation. 286 The capacity of A. fumigatus to damage host cells is a key aspect of the pathogenesis of IA. 287 Thus, it was of interest to determine that HSAE cells were more susceptible than A549 cells to 288 damage caused by live and killed A. fumigatus germlings and by A. fumigatus culture filtrates. 289 We also found that killed germlings and culture filtrates of strain Af293 caused more damage to 290 both types of epithelial cells relative to strain CEA10. While the exact mechanisms by which A. 291 fumigatus damages host cells are incompletely understood, it is virtually certain that damage is 292 caused by secondary metabolites produced by the fungus. In Aspergillus spp., the genes that 293 encode the enzymes for secondary metabolite production are usually located in gene clusters 294 that exhibit significant strain-to-strain variability. The genome of strain Af293 contains 35 295 biosynthetic gene clusters whereas that of strain CEA10 contains 33, and the profile of 296 secondary metabolites produced by strain Af293 in vitro is different from that of CEA10 (45). 297 Also, we have found that the SltA transcription factor governs the expression of different 298 biosynthetic gene clusters in strain Af293 relative to strain CEA10 (32). These genetic 299 differences likely account for the differences in epithelial cell damage caused by the two A. 300 fumigatus strains. 301 Pulmonary epithelial cells provide the first-line defense against fungal pathogens during lung 302 infection. In addition to functioning as a physical barrier to infection, they secrete cytokines and 303 chemokines that recruit and activate phagocytes to kill the invading fungus (17, 36, 46). 304 Although we determined that both A549 and HSAE cells responded to A. fumigatus infection by 305 secreting proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, the patterns of these response were 306 different. Overall, A549 cells secreted higher levels and a greater range of these 307 immunomodulators than HSAE cells, suggesting that type II alveolar cells may play a greater 308 role than small airway epithelial cells in orchestrating the host response to A. fumigatus. 309 However, because small airway epithelial cells are more numerous than type II alveolar cells, 310\nthey still may play a significant role in the host defense against A. fumigatus. This hypothesis 311 needs to be evaluated by in vivo studies. 312 During the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis, the fungus interacts with multiple types of 313 pulmonary epithelial cells. To develop therapeutic strategies to block the capacity of A. 314 fumigatus to invade and damage the pulmonary epithelium, it is necessary to develop a 315 comprehensive understanding of how the fungus interacts with the different types of epithelial 316 cells that line the airways and alveoli. Here, we demonstrate that A. fumigatus invades and 317 damages A549 and HSAE cells by different mechanisms and that these two different cell lines 318 produce different profiles of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to fungal infection. Thus, 319 HSAE cells provide complementary data to A549 cells and represent a useful model for 320 studying the interactions of A. fumigatus with bronchiolar epithelial cells in vitro. 321 322 MATERIALS AND METHODS 323 Strains, growth condition. All A. fumigatus strains (listed in Table S2) were grown on 324 Sabouraud dextrose agar (Difco) at 37 oC for 7-10 days prior to use. Conidia were harvested 325 with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich), filtered with a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer 326 (Corning), and enumerated with a hemacytometer. To produce germlings, the conidia were 327 incubated in Sabouraud dextrose broth (Difco) at 37oC for 5.5 h as described (16). For 328 experiments with killed germlings, conidia were incubated in Sabouraud dextrose broth for 8 h 329 and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min or with 0.2% of 330 thimerosal at 4oC overnight. Killing was confirmed by absence of growth after incubating the 331 hyphae on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates for 2 d. 332 Strain construction. To construct the \u0394pacC (Afu3g11790) deletion mutant, a transient 333 CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion system was used (47, 48). The Cas9 expression cassette was 334 amplified from plasmid pFC331, using primers Cas9-F and Cas9-R. All primers are listed in 335 Table S3. To construct the sgRNA expression cassette, two DNA fragments were amplified from 336\nplasmid pFC334 using primers sgRNA-F and sgRNA-PacC-R, and sgRNA-R, sgRNA-PacC-F. 337 Next, the sgRNA expression cassette was amplified by fusion PCR from the two DNA fragments, 338 using primers sgRNA-F and sgRNA-R. The hygromycin resistance (HygR) repair template was 339 amplified from plasmid pVG2.2-hph using primers Hyg-F and Hyg-R, which had about 50 bp of 340 homology to the 5\u2019 end of the protein coding sequence of the gene and the 3\u2019 end of the protein 341 coding sequence, respectively. The HygR repair template was mixed with the Cas9 cassette 342 and the two sgRNA cassettes and then used for protoplast transformation. Hygromycin resistant 343 clones were screened for deletion of pacC by colony PCR using primers PacC-Screen-F, PacC-344 Screen-R and insertion of HygR using primers PacC-Screen-up, Hyg-Screen-R. The positive 345 clones were also confirmed for absence of integration of DNA encoding Cas9 or the gRNA, 346 using primers Cas9-ScreenF and Cas9-ScreenR, and sgRNA-ScreenF, sgRNA-ScreenR. 347 To construct the \u2206pacC + pacC complemented strain, a 5888 bp fragment containing the 348 pacC protein coding sequence and approximately 2.5 kb of 5\u2019 flanking sequence and 0.5 kb of 3\u2019 349 flanking sequence was PCR-amplified from Af293 genomic DNA using primers PacC-Com-F 350 and PacC-Com-R. The resulting fragment was cloned into the NotI site of plasmid p402 (31), 351 which was used to transform the \u2206pacC strain. To confirm the presence of the complementation 352 plasmid, the phleomycin-resistant colonies were screened by colony PCR using primers PacC-353 Com-F and PacC-Com-R to detect pacC. The transcript levels of pacC in the various clones 354 were quantified by real-time RT-PCR using primers PacC-Realtime-F and PacC-Realtime-R. 355 The clones in which the transcript level of pacC was most similar to that of the wild-type strain 356 was used in all experiments. 357 Different strains of A. fumigatus that constitutively expressed GFP were constructed to use 358 in epithelial cell invasion assays (32). The \u0394pacC mutant was transformed with plasmid GFP-359 Phleo and the \u0394pacC+pacC complemented strain was transformed with plasmid GFP-pPTRI as 360 previously described (16). 361\nCell lines. All cell lines were purchased from a from the American Type Culture Collection. 362 The A549 cell line was cultured in F-12 K medium (30-2004; ATCC) supplemented with 10% 363 fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bio-Products) and 1% streptomycin and penicillin (Irvine 364 Scientific). HSAEC1-KT cells were cultured in SAGM BulletKit medium (CC-3119 and CC-4124; 365 Lonza) and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium (10569010; Gibco) supplemented 366 with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% streptomycin and penicillin. Cells were cultured at 37oC 367 with 5% CO2. The A549, HSAEC1-KT and HEK293T cell lines were authenticated by ATCC. All 368 cell lines had no mycoplasma contamination. All the experiments in this study were performed 369 using monolayers of A549 and HSAE cells exposed to A. fumigatus in serum-free medium. 370 Where relevant, A549 or HSAE cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 371 20 min and then rinsed extensively with PBS before use. 372 Ethics statement. The mouse study and experimental procedures were approved by the 373 Animal Care and Use Committee at the Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-374 UCLA Medical Center. 375 Mouse models of invasive aspergillosis. To visualize the epithelial cell interactions of 376 inhaled conidia in vivo, a minor modification of our standard mouse model of invasive 377 aspergillosis was used (16). Briefly, 6-week male Balb/C mice (Taconic Laboratories) were 378 immunosuppressed with cortisone acetate (Sigma-Aldrich; 500 mg/kg) administrated 379 subcutaneously every other day starting at day -4 before infection. Three mice were 380 intratracheally inoculated with 107 conidia of strain Af293. After 12 h of infection, the mice were 381 sacrificed, after which their lungs were harvested and processed for histochemical analysis with 382 Gomori methenamine silver staining. The slides were viewed by light microscopy and 383 representative images were obtained. 384 Scanning electron microscopy. For electron microscopy, 105 germlings/ml of strains Af293 385 and CEA10 were incubated with A549 and HSAE cells on glass coverslips for 2.5 h. The 386 coverslips were then rinsed in PBS and fixed overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M 387\nsodium cacodylate buffer at 4\u00b0C. After dehydrating and critical-point drying the samples, they 388 were sputter coated with Au-Pd and imaged with a Hitachi S-3000 N scanning electron 389 microscope. 390 Host cell endocytosis assay. The endocytosis of conidia and germlings of different strains 391 by A549 and HSAE cell lines was determined by our previously described differential 392 fluorescence assay (16, 32). Briefly, 2.5 x 105 host cells were grown to confluency on glass 393 coverslips in a 24-well tissue culture plate. The cells were incubated with 105 cells of GFP-394 expressing conidia or germlings and incubated for 6 h for experiments with conidia, 2.5 h for 395 experiments with germlings and live host cells, and 3.5 h for experiments with germlings and 396 killed host cells. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were rinsed with PBS in a 397 standardized manner, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with a rabbit polyclonal anti-398 Aspergillus antibody (Meridian Life Science, Inc.) followed by an AlexaFluor 568-labeled goat 399 anti-rabbit antibody (Life Technologies). The coverslips were mounted inverted on microscope 400 slides and viewed under epifluorescence. At least 100 organisms per coverslip were scored for 401 endocytosis and each strain was tested in triplicate in three independent experiments. 402 In some assays, the epithelial cells were incubated with 0.6 \u00b5M cytochalasin D (C2618; 403 Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.5 \u00b5M colchicine (PHR1764; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1% DMSO. Control cells 404 were incubated with 0.1% DMSO only. For antibody blocking experiments, the epithelial cells 405 were incubated with 10 \u00b5g/mL of an anti-\u03b21 integrin antibody (6S6; Millipore), 25 \u00b5g/mL of an 406 anti-\u03b15 integrin antibody (NKI-SAM-1; Millipore), or 3 ug/ml of an anti-Dectin-1 antibody 407 (MAB1859; R&D Systems). Mouse IgG was used as a control. In all experiments, the inhibitors 408 or antibodies were added 45 min prior to infection and remained in the medium for the duration 409 of the experiment. 410 To knockdown E-cadherin, A549 and HSAE cells were transfected with E-cadherin siRNA 411 (sc-35242; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or random control siRNA (Qiagen) using Lipofectamine 412 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The efficiency of siRNA knockdown 413\nwas verified by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with an anti-E-cadherin (24E10, Cell 414 signaling) antibody. 415 CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of integrin \u03b15 in A549 and HSAE cells. Two independent guide 416 RNAs for ITGA5 (Table S2) from the Brunello sgRNA library (49) were synthesized (Sigma-417 Aldrich) and cloned in to the pLentiCRISPRv2-blast plasmid (#98293; Addgene). After 418 confirmation by Sanger sequencing, each plasmid was used the generate a lentivirus. Lentiviral 419 packaging was carried out in HEK293T cells using the 3rd generation packaging plasmids pCMV 420 delat R8.2 (#12263; Addgene) and pCMV-VSVG (#8454; Addgene). A549 or HSAE cells were 421 transduced with the lentiviruses in the presence of 10 \u00b5g/mL polybrene (Santa Cruz 422 Biotechnology). The next day, transduced cells were selected with 20 \u00b5g/ml blasticidin (A11139-423 03; Gibco) and the blasticidin-resistant cells were processed for single colonies. Independent 424 single-cell derived gene-deletion cell lines were confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-425 integrin \u03b15 antibody (AB150361; Abcam). 426 Confocal microscopy. To visualize actin remodeling during A. fumigatus endocytosis, 427 A549 and HSAE cells were infected for 2.5 h and then fixed as in the endocytosis assay. After 428 permeablizing the cells with 0.1% triton X-100, they were sequentially stained with the anti-429 aspergillus antibody, AlexaFluor 647-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody, and ActinRedTM 555 430 (R37112; Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted onto slides and imaged by confocal 431 microscopy (Leica SP8). 432 Cell damage assay. The amount of damage to A549 and HSAE cells caused by direct 433 contact with A. fumigatus was determined using a 51Cr release assay as described previously 434 (13). The inoculum was 5 x 105 conidia per well and the incubation time was 24 h. To determine 435 extent of damage caused by killed A. fumigatus germlings, the cells were infected with 5 x 105 436 germlings that had been killed with thimerosal or paraformaldehyde. To determine the amount 437 of damage caused by secreted fungal products, conidia of A. fumigatus were incubated in 438 DMEM (GibcoTM)at a final concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ml in 5% CO2 at 37oC. After 48 h, the 439\nculture supernatant was filter sterilized, mixed with fresh tissue culture medium at a ratio of 1:3 440 (v/v) and added to 51Cr-loaded epithelial cells for various times. Each experiment was performed 441 in triplicate at least 3 times. 442 Cytokine and chemokine production. A549 and HSAE cells in 24-well plates were 443 infected with 5 x 105 conidia of strain Af293. After 24 h infection, the conditioned medium was 444 collected, clarified by centrifugated, and stored in aliquots at -80 oC. At a later time, the 445 concentration of CXCL8, CXCL1/KC, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, GM-CSF, and CCL2/MCP-1 in 446 the medium was determined using the Luminex multiplex assay (R&D Systems). The 447 experiment was performed in duplicate on 3 separate occasions. 448 Statistics. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8. Data 449 were compared using the unpaired, two-sided Students t test or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s 450 test for multiple comparisons.
