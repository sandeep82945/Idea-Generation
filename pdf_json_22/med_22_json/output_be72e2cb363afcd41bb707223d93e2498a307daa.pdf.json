However, an economical, efficient, and non-invasive assessment of HER2 is lacking. We aimed to develop a clinicoradiomic nomogram based on radiomics scores extracted from multiparametric MRI (mpMRI, including ADC-map, T2W1, DCE-T1WI) and clinical risk factors to assess HER2 status. Methods: We retrospectively collected 214 patients with pathologically confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma between January 2018 to March 2021 from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, and randomly divided this cohort into training set (n = 128, 42 HER2-positive and 86 HER2-negative cases) and validation set (n = 86, 28 HER2positive and 58 HER2-negative cases) at a ratio of 6:4. The original and transformed pretherapy mpMRI images were treated by semi-automated segmentation and manual modification on the DeepWise scientific research platform v1.6 (http:// keyan. deepw ise. com/), then radiomics feature extraction was implemented with PyRadiomics library. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) based on logistic regression (LR) and LASSO regression were adpoted to identify optimal features before modeling. LR, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), naive Bayesian (NB) and XGBoost (XGB) algorithms were used to construct the radiomics signatures. Independent clinical predictors were identified through univariate logistic analysis (age, tumor location, ki-67 index, histological grade, and lymph node metastasis). Then, the radiomics signature with the best diagnostic performance (Rad score) was further combined with significant clinical risk factors to develop a clinicoradiomic model (nomogram) using multivariate logistic regression. The discriminative power of the constructed models were evaluated by AUC, DeLong test, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: 70 (32.71%) of the enrolled 214 cases were HER2-positive, while 144 (67.29%) were HER2-negative. Eleven best radiomics features were retained to develop 6 radiomcis classifiers in which RF classifier showed the highest AUC of 0.887 (95%CI: 0.827\u20130.947) in the training set and acheived the AUC of 0.840 (95%CI: 0.758\u20130.922) in the validation set.

BMC Cancer (2022) 22:872 Introduction Breast carcinoma is the most widespread and lethal tumor among women [1]. The most common histological type is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), which accounts for roughly 80% of all breast carcinomas, with 20% \u2013 30% expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positivity [2]. Numerous studies substantiated the association of HER2 gene overexpression with the division, proliferation, and nourishment of new vasculature of breast carcinoma cells. Overexpression of HER2 is significantly correlated with high aggressiveness and poor prognosis in breast carcinoma patients [3\u20136]. Consequently, advancement in HER2-targeted therapy  was considered a prominent breakthrough in breast carcinoma treatment [7, 8]. Therefore, determining the HER2 expression status in  breast carcinoma patients is an essential precondition to identifying potential candidates for treatment decisions. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) method for testing HER-2 expression is a standard procedure in our laboratory and a part of our pathology reports in invasive breast carcinomas, and FISH is the subsequent and gold method in equivocal (2 +) IHC cases [9]. These two methods are more timeconsuming, and takes 5\u201312  days after specimens are provided. FISH is difficult to apply, and requires trained technicians.  It is more expensive since it requires test kits and a special microscope, and stained preparations cannot be archived [10].  Radiomics allows inference of tumoral molecular status from medical image-derived features, and it allows the study of the tumoral heterogeneity both spatially and over time; radiomics have the potential to enable spatio-longitudinal monitoring of tumor biology before and during treatment. Existing literature has recently documented a correlation between MRI image expression and breast carcinoma HER2 expression level [11\u201315]. Song et  al. [11] reported that texture features derived from kinetic parameter maps, calculated based on breast DCE-T1W1, can be used as imaging biomarkers to distinguish HER2positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. The best model with features extracted from the slope of signal intensity (SIslope) map yielded an AUC of 0.79 in the test set. Another radiomic study by Li et al. [12] selected ER status and radiomics features in DWI images to establish the nomogram, which yielded good discrimination (AUC: 0.883/0.848) and calibration. The radiomics nomogram showed favorable performance for evaluating HER2 status in breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the HER2 express status in breast carcinoma could be better predicted by radiomics signature established from the mpMRI compared with single-parametric signature. Zhou et al. found the prediction ability of the developed SVM model in HER2 status of breast carcinoma patients based on T2WI, DCE-T1W1, and a combination of the two sequences. The multiparameter-related model manifested the best efficiency in forecasting the HER2 status with an AUC of 0.86 and 0.81 in the learning and test cohorts, respectively [16]. However, no published study has discussed the MRI combining with clinical pathological risk factors, such as Ki-67 index, histological grade, and lymph node metastasis, in predicting HER2 expression, and no published study has applied clinicoradiomic models (nomogram) using multiple machine learning algorithms in predicting HER2 expression in invasive ductal carcinoma. This paper aims to investigate and compare the performance of radiomics features from different types of MR images (fat-suppressed T2-weighted images (T2WI), diffusion coefficient map (ADC-map), and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (DCE-T1WI)) and the performance of their fusions using different machine learning algorithms. In addition, a nomogram incorporating the mpMRI-based radiomics signature and clinical predictors was developed to improve the discriminative and interpretable ability of the classifier for HER2 status prediction. Materials and methods Study population The Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Shaoxing Central Hospital Ethical Committee approved this study protocol, and the requirement for written informed consent was waived. Between January 2018 and March 2021, we retrospectively collected breast tumor cases confirmed by clinical examination and diagnosed by ultrasound examination in our center. Inclusion grade) was constructed and yielded better discrimination compared with Rad score (p = 0.374, Delong test), with an AUC of 0.945 (95%CI: 0.904\u20130.987) in the training set and 0.868 (95%CI: 0.789\u20130.948; p = 0.123) in the validation set. Moreover, calibration with the p-value of 0.732 using Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test demonstrated good agreement, and the DCA verified the benefits of the nomogram. Conclusion: Post largescale validation, the clinicoradiomic nomogram may have the potential to be used as a noninvasive tool for determination of HER2 expression status in clinical HER2-targeted therapy prediction.",

The original and transformed pretherapy mpMRI images were treated by semi-automated segmentation and manual modification on the DeepWise scientific research platform v1.6 (http:// keyan. deepw ise. com/), then radiomics feature extraction was implemented with PyRadiomics library. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) based on logistic regression (LR) and LASSO regression were adpoted to identify optimal features before modeling. LR, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), naive Bayesian (NB) and XGBoost (XGB) algorithms were used to construct the radiomics signatures. Independent clinical predictors were identified through univariate logistic analysis (age, tumor location, ki-67 index, histological grade, and lymph node metastasis).

            "text": "Breast carcinoma is the most widespread and lethal tumor among women [1]. The most common histological type is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), which accounts for roughly 80% of all breast carcinomas, with 20% \u2013 30% expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positivity [2]. Numerous studies substantiated the association of HER2 gene overexpression with the division, proliferation, and nourishment of new vasculature of breast carcinoma cells. Overexpression of HER2 is significantly correlated with high aggressiveness and poor prognosis in breast carcinoma patients [3\u20136]. Consequently, advancement in HER2-targeted therapy\u00a0 was considered a prominent breakthrough in breast carcinoma treatment [7, 8]. Therefore, determining the HER2 expression status in\u00a0 breast carcinoma patients\u00a0is an\u00a0essential precondition to identifying potential candidates for treatment decisions. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) method for testing HER-2 expression is a standard procedure in our laboratory and a part of our pathology reports in invasive breast carcinomas, and FISH is the subsequent and gold method in equivocal (2 +) IHC cases [9].\u00a0These two methods are more timeconsuming, and takes 5\u201312\u00a0 days after specimens are provided. FISH is difficult to apply, and requires trained technicians.\u00a0 It is more expensive since it requires test kits and a special microscope, and stained preparations cannot be archived [10].\u00a0 Radiomics allows inference of tumoral molecular status from medical image-derived features, and it allows the study of the tumoral heterogeneity both spatially and over time; radiomics have the potential to enable spatio-longitudinal monitoring of tumor biology before and during treatment.\nExisting literature has recently documented a correlation between MRI image expression and breast carcinoma HER2 expression level [11\u201315]. Song et\u00a0 al. [11] reported that texture features derived from kinetic parameter maps, calculated based on breast DCE-T1W1, can be used as imaging biomarkers to distinguish HER2positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. The best model with features extracted from the slope of signal intensity (SIslope) map yielded an AUC of 0.79 in the test set. Another radiomic study by Li et\u00a0al. [12] selected ER\nstatus and radiomics features in DWI images to establish the nomogram, which yielded good discrimination (AUC: 0.883/0.848) and calibration. The radiomics nomogram showed favorable performance for evaluating HER2 status in breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the HER2 express status in breast carcinoma could be better predicted by radiomics signature established from the mpMRI compared with single-parametric signature. Zhou et\u00a0al. found the prediction ability of the developed SVM model in HER2 status of breast carcinoma patients based on T2WI, DCE-T1W1, and a combination of the two sequences. The multiparameter-related model manifested the best efficiency in forecasting the HER2 status with an AUC of 0.86 and 0.81 in the learning and test cohorts, respectively [16]. However, no published study has discussed the MRI combining with clinical pathological risk factors, such as Ki-67 index, histological grade, and lymph node metastasis, in predicting HER2 expression, and no published study has applied clinicoradiomic models (nomogram) using multiple machine learning algorithms in predicting HER2 expression in invasive ductal carcinoma.\nThis paper aims to investigate and compare the performance of radiomics features from different types of MR images (fat-suppressed T2-weighted images (T2WI), diffusion coefficient map (ADC-map), and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (DCE-T1WI)) and the performance of their fusions using different machine learning algorithms. In addition, a nomogram incorporating the mpMRI-based radiomics signature and clinical predictors was developed to improve the discriminative and interpretable ability of the classifier for HER2 status prediction."

In the case of multicentric lesions, the largest major lesion of them was selected to enter the group. Patient demographic data, including age, tumor location, menopause status, and a family history of breast carcinoma in first-degree relatives, were retrieved from the Electronic Medical Record System. Pathological data were tumor pathological type and histological grade, the expression status of HER2, Ki-67 index, and lymph node metastasis. The final cohort comprised of 214 patients and was randomly split with a ratio of 6:4 [17, 18], to create the training set (n = 128, 42 HER2positive and 86 HER2-negative cases) and validation set (n = 86, 28 HER2-positive and 58 HER2-negative cases), respectively for subsequent analyses.

Two radiologists with more than 10-year experience in breast imaging diagnosis semi-automatically segmented lesions layer-by-layer and analyzed after merging them into the three-dimensional region of interests (3D ROIs, VOIs). After carefully scrutinizing the tumor region, disagreements were resolved by consensus-based discussion or decided by superior physicians. The 3rd sequence during the dynamic enhancement course was selected after about 240\u00a0s of injecting contrast medium. At this point, malignant lesions generally show a peak enhancement to present a clear contrast with the surrounding normal breast parenchyma, which is conducive to more accurate VOI delineation and feature extraction. The selected VOI should conform to the following criteria: (1) Include cystic lesion, necrosis, and halo-sign; (2) Invasion of surrounding structures: areas connected to VOI and have the same enhancement pattern with the VOI; (3) The lesion VOI < 5 mm3 is waived. The VOIs of T1-DCE were registered and applied to the other two sequences, and the image slicers and orientation were precisely matched between T2WI and ADC-map. Supplemental Figure S1 provided the process of segmentation and VOI selection of two typical HER2-positive and HER2negative cases. Then, B-spline interpolation was carried out to standard the image into the same spatial resolution (1\u00a0 mm \u00d7 1\u00a0 mm \u00d7 1\u00a0 mm)[19\u201321] and followed by the absolute gray-level discretization with fixed bin size (FBS) set to 5 as previous studies suggested [20\u201323]. In particular, the processes of image interpolation and graylevel discretization were both aligned to IBSI [21]."

For original and other-transformed images, first-order, shape, and texture features were extracted, respectively, and implemented with the open-source PyRadiomics library (https:// github. com/ Radio mics/ pyrad iomics). Subsequently, Z-score transformation was used to normalize the feature distribution in the training set, and the data in the validation set were then standardized by the same calculated parameters to avoid data leakage. The implementation\nof feature extraction and standardization was compliant with Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) [21]. For each sequence, we initially extracted 1906 radiomics features from VOIs, including 396 first-order features, 14 shape features (including three 2D features), and 1496 texture features. A suffix was added for the different series (i.e., \u20181\u2019 represents ADCmap, \u20182\u2019 represents T2WI, \u20183\u2019 represents DCE-T1WI).

And features with intra- or inter-observer ICC values lower than 0.75 were discarded before subsequent feature selection. Moreover, we applied Pearson\u2019s correlation with a threshold of 0.9 in training set to minimize the potential collinearity of variables."

The reason for selecting and comparing these methods in this study was that they were common classifiers in the related study for breast in previous studies, such as undergoing mastectomy prediction [24], breast cancer prediction [25], axillary lymph node metastasis [26]. To avoid over-fitting in the modeling process, the hyper-parameter searching for optimal classifiers were completed by grid-search method using the tenfold cross-validation repeatedly. After the completion of radiomics classifiers, multivariate logistic regression analysis and backward stepwise regression analysis based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were devised to establish a clinicoradiomic model (nomogram) incorporating significant clinical predictors and radiomics classifiers. Thus, we developed the visual nomogram of the clinicoradiomic model to calculate the probability of HER2-positive breast cancer."

The Rad score classifier based on the RF algorithm exhibited good efficiency in differentiating HER2-positive from HER2-negative disease, in which the AUCs, accuracy, true positive, and negative rates were 0.927 (95%CI: 0.876\u20130.978), 85.1%, 88.1% and 83.7% respectively, in the training cohort, and 0.826 (95%CI: 0.738\u20130.914), 74.4%, 85.7% and 68.9%, respectively, in the validation cohort. We then created a nomogram by combining the Rad score with the independent clinical predictors (histological grade and ki-67) with univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. The finding demonstrated that the nomogram could provide superior classification and recognition in HER2-positive patients (the AUCs of 0.945 and 0.868 in the training and validation sets). Thus, we concluded that applying radiomics features from mpMRI data incorporating machine learning algorithm contributed to the good discriminative performance in the HER2 status.\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in applying quantitative imaging data to delineate intrinsic biological characteristics [29\u201334]. Diverse research has dissected the dependence between radiomic signatures and HER2 expression status [35\u201340]. Zhou et\u00a0 al. [35]. noninvasively evaluated the efficacy of mammography radiomics signatures in diagnosing the patients\u2019 HER2 status with breast carcinoma, including mediolateral oblique (MLO) and cranial caudal (CC) views, with an AUC of 0.846 in the training set and an AUC of 0.74 in the testing set. Another similar study also highlighted the connection between radiomics signatures from multidetector computed breast mammography images with HER2 express status [36]. Daniele La Forgia et\u00a0 al. [41]. reported that radiomics combining contrast-enhanced spectral mammography performed well in predicting histological subtypes of breast cancer, with accuracies of 90.87%and 84.80% in discriminating HER2 + /HER2 \u2212 and Ki67 + / Ki67 \u2212 breast cancer, respectively. Those studies indicated that radiomics analysis was a useful analytical tool to predict HER2 status in breast cancer, which is consistent with the findings of this study.Another radiomic study by Bitencourt et\u00a0al. [42].developed machine learning models (including both clinical and radiomics MRI features) to predict HER2 expression levels and pathologic response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2 over-expressing breast cancer patients. The model predicted HER2 heterogeneity and pCR with diagnostic\naccuracy of 97.4% and 83.9% in the test set, respectively. More specifically, the HER2 express status in breast carcinoma could be better predicted by a radiomics signature established from the mpMRI compared with a single-parametric signature. Huang et\u00a0 al. [43].showed that multi-parametric MRI-based radiomics combined with different machine learning approaches could be a promising method to predict the molecular subtype and AR expression of breast cancer non-invasively. In this study, the results verified the conclusion with the superior performance of prediction, in which the Rad score based on mpMRI images achieved higher AUC values of 0.927 and 0.826 than other single-parametric models (i.e., ADC-map, T2W1, and DCE-T1W1) in training (AUC: 0.816, 0.743 and 0.810) and validation sets (AUC: 0.719, 0.694 and 0.756), respectively.\nMany studies have reported the association between histological grade, Ki-67 index, and HER2 status; HER2-positive expression has a relationship with high nuclear grade and ki-67 index [44\u201346]. In contrast, our study showed that only the ki-67 index and histological grade could be used as an independent predictor of HER2 expression. The ki-67as proliferation marker has been successfully used as a tool for clinical decisionmaking, specifically how it can be used to select the optimal treatment for each individual patient [47]. Tumor histological grade has previously been linked to HER2 status. HER2 expression has previously been found to correlate with a higher nuclear grade but not with tumor stage [45]. However, none of these studies developed a predictive model that included these predictors. Our study is the first to develop a nomogram to perform this prediction. Recently, the added value of the nomogram model based on radiomics signature and clinical factors for pathological outcome prediction [48\u201350] has been investigated by some studies. Our results showed the highest performance compared with existing work, which is another clinical contribution of this work. In this study, 11 optimal features were finally retained for modeling, including morphological, first-order, GLCM, GLDM, and GLSZM characteristics, which are predominantly involved in tumor heterogeneity. Based on tumor size and morphology, a significant correlation existed between the characteristics of shape_Maximum 2D Diameter, shape_Maximum 3D Diameter, shape_Sphericity, and the HER2 expression of breast carcinoma. Consistent with the previous report [51], the morphology and size of lesions vary with the different expressions of hormone receptors (HR). Much irregular and larger lesions were reported in the cases of HR-negative plus HER2-positive compared with the hormone HR-positive plus HER2-negative. In the present study, high kurtosis was found in\nmost HER2-positive cases, which is consistent with the existing work. Fan et\u00a0al. [52] constructed a predictive model for four molecular subtypes classification of breast carcinoma based on the DCE-T1W1 images and two clinical risk factors, revealing the potential of kurtosis as an independent predictor for classifying molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma. Previous studies have shown that texture analysis can provide information on tumor cellular and histological components [53, 54]. The SizeZoneNonUniformityNormalized texture feature measures the variability of zone volumes throughout the image. A higher value indicates more inhomogeneity among zone volumes in the image; thus, we concluded the irregular volume distribution of the HER2-positive group, which may be caused by the unequal growth rate of tumors in various directions. The texture features of glcm_Idmn, glcm_Dmn, and gldm_Dependence from wavelet-transformed images can reflect the homogeneity and consistency of tumor texture characteristics, conducive to the better exploration of intra-tumor heterogeneity and subtle differences in grey and texture level feature [55]. The DependenceEntropy texture feature measures the intensity differences in the neighborhood; the higher value represents a more disordered internal density of the tumor; hence, we found the complex heterogeneity existed in the HER2-positive texture patterns.\nThe mpMRI facilitates a comprehensive analysis of radiomics features; the established nomogram can fully combine the characteristics of different sequences. Nonetheless, there are several limitations to this study. Firstly, the limited sample size and all the cases were from one center. Therefore, additional validation of the constructed models on multicentric studies with a large study population is required. Second, to avoid confounding influences associated with the pathological type, the study only enrolled patients with IDC-NST, the most common form of breast carcinoma. Thirdly, we only used the traditional machine learning classification algorithms to explore the predefined radiomics features instead of the more informative and abstract features extracted by deep learning algorithms from MR images."
