            "text": "NFDI4Biodiversity is a consortium within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) dedicated to data and services for biodiversity research and ecology [1]. The 50 partner organisations represent typical stakeholders in the domain: Research groups with a variety of methods and data types from taxonomic and ecosystem research, natural history collections with digitisation projects for data and objects, and the nature conservation domain, where Citizen scientists and highly specialised expert organisations contribute large amounts of structured observation data. IT service centres and informatics research groups bring important technical competencies to the group.\nData on the biodiversity of animals, plants and microorganisms typically include species observations recorded in the form of tables, photos, videos, specimens and audio files. Specimens are also frequently collected and preserved for further analysis and description.\nCoRDI2023-55 1\nIncreasingly important is genetic information on the observed species, i.e. sequence data and data from other -omics methodology (metabolomics, glycomics, and transcriptomics), which provide information on biological functions. Contextual data on environmental conditions in the species' habitat, on land use or colonisation are also relevant. Data streams from continuous monitoring of environmental parameters by sensors/satellites bring on new infrastructure requirements.\nWell-developed international networks exist, with quite mature tools and data standards (see Table 1). These are used and disseminated in the NFDI4Biodiversity project in order to mobilise and publish data collected by national stakeholders according to the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. NFDI4Biodiversity also builds on services provided by the German Federation for Biological Data (GFBio e.V.), the German Network on Bioinformatics Infrastructure - Deutsches Netzwerk f\u00fcr Bioinformatik Infrastruktur (de.NBI), and the eight German GBIF nodes.\nGFBio services are structured along the data life cycle, from the preparation of a data management plan to data archiving and publishing [2]. A data submission service is provided, where researchers can submit heterogeneous data files from their projects for curation and archiving in matching data archives, including the European Nucleotide Archive ENA. Any submission or consultation generates a ticket that is handled by a professional helpdesk team with representatives from the associated data centres.\nCoRDI2023-55 2"

            "text": "Mobilising data is facilitated if partners get added value for their own day-to-day business, for example the digitisation of work processes. In a use case project with the Bavarian Forest National Park, BEXIS (Information System of the Biodiversity Exploratories) was established as a hosted database solution for scientific data management in the national park's projects, facilitating data publications in the future. In the use case for a Living Atlas of Germany, partners are provided with BioCASE installations to facilitate data publications from local systems to the GBIF and GFBio data portals. In 2022, flexible funds from the NFDI4Biodiversity consortium were used to create the development of an open web service interface to the new checklist infrastructure of the National Red List Centre.\nIn order to increase our outreach to scientists, we introduced a \"Front Office/Back Office model\" in the Helpdesk support: Initial consulting by local data stewards at research performing organisations is linked to the subject-specific consulting services of the NFDI4Biodiversity network (see Fig. 1). The model was prototypically implemented with the Research Initiative for Biodiversity Conservation (FEdA) [3]. We see the model as an effective building block for the professional management of data from large research collaborations as well as the \"long tail of science\" at universities and institutes.\nOn a technical level, the vision of NFDI4Biodiversity is a federated, distributed IT infrastructure (\"Commons\") that provides users with access to tried-and-tested applications for data analysis and publication, in combination with tools for storage and semantic integration. Scientific IT centres in the network provide cloud infrastructure and storage and act as bridges into the network of high-performance computing centres."

The consortium is also a forum for technical and legal matters of data and data-related workflows. With regard to future\nCoRDI2023-55 3\ndevelopment, we see two important lines of development: a) sustainable funding for the public core data resources in the life sciences; b) integration of data management structures in the national and international biodiversity monitoring programmes with the scientific research infrastructure landscape. In this way, we can mobilise and provide the extensive data that stakeholders from science, politics, economy and society need for better contributions to the conservation of global biodiversity."
