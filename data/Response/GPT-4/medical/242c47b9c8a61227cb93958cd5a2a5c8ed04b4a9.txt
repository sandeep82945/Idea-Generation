Expansion to Urban Populations: Given the focus on rural elderly populations in this study, a natural extension would be to explore the impact of urban pension schemes on health outcomes among the elderly in urban areas. This could involve comparing the effects of different pension schemes across rural and urban settings to identify which aspects are most beneficial for health outcomes.

Longitudinal Impact Study: The current study provides a snapshot of the impact of the NRPS on elderly health outcomes. A future research direction could involve a longitudinal study that tracks health outcomes over time among a cohort of elderly individuals before and after the implementation of the NRPS. This could provide deeper insights into how long-term financial security influences health trajectories in older age.

Subgroup Analyses for Other Chronic Diseases: The study highlighted significant effects of NRPS on health outcomes for elderly with COPD and asthma. Future research could focus on subgroup analyses for other chronic diseases not covered in this study, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and mental health conditions, to understand the differential impact of NRPS across various health conditions.

Qualitative Studies on NRPS Perception and Utilization: Beyond quantitative impacts, qualitative research could explore how elderly individuals perceive the NRPS and how it influences their health behaviors and healthcare utilization. Interviews and focus groups could uncover the mechanisms through which financial security translates into health improvements or identify barriers to accessing the benefits of NRPS.

Impact of NRPS on Healthcare Expenditure and Accessibility: Investigating how NRPS influences healthcare expenditure patterns and access to healthcare services among the elderly with chronic diseases could provide insights into how pension schemes contribute to healthcare system sustainability. This research could examine whether NRPS recipients are more likely to seek preventive care, adhere to treatment regimens, or experience fewer financial barriers to accessing healthcare services.
