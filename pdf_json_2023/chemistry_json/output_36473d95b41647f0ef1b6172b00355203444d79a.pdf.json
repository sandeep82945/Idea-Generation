    "abstractText": "As a transition strategy towards sustainability, food packaging plays a crucial role in the current era. This, carried out in a biorefinery context of agricultural residues, involves not only obtaining desirable products but a comprehensive utilization of biomass that contributes to the circular bioeconomy. The present work proposes the preparation of bioactive absorbent food pads through a multi-product biorefinery approach from bay tree pruning waste (BTPW). In a first step, chitosan aerogels reinforced with lignocellulose and cellulose micro/nanofibers from BTPW were prepared, studying the effect of residual lignin on the material\u2019s properties. The presence of micro/nanofibers improved the mechanical performance (up to 60%) in addition to increasing the water uptake (42%) when lignin was present. The second step was to make them bioactive by incorporating bay leaf extract. The residual lignin in the micro/nanofibers was decisive, since when present, the release profiles of the extract were faster, reaching an antioxidant power of more than 85% after only 30 min. Finally, these bioactive aerogels were used as absorbent pads for fresh meat. With the use of the bioactive aerogels (with \u22652% extract), the meat remained fresh for 10 days as a result of delayed oxidation of the food during storage (20% metmyoglobin proportion).",

            "text": "Food losses and food waste are some of the biggest concerns for modern society and the food industry. In addition, foodborne outbreaks pose a threat to public health. These facts make the market for the food industry increasingly demanding, and in this context, packaging plays a crucial role. This is because packaging can not only protect the food from the external environment and maintain its quality but also add functionalities that improve the nutritional value of the food product by incorporating compounds that are beneficial to health, such as antioxidant compounds [1,2]. In the specific case of meat packaging, absorbent pads are commonly used for moisture control as they absorb the excess liquid released by meat during storage. When it is desired to apply absorbent pads in meat preservation, the ideal would be materials with antioxidant capacity to inhibit the oxidation process that occurs during meat storage and compromises its quality. Thus, the presence of antioxidant compounds is expected to reduce the oxidation of polyunsaturated acids [3,4]. The architecture of these pads is usually two-layered: an upper layer made from impermeable and non-adherent synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene, and a hydrophilic non-woven lower layer containing active substances that inhibit bacterial growth [5]. However, due to the serious environmental problems associated with the manufacture of synthetic plastics and additives, food packaging industries are looking for new alternatives that prioritize the use of more sustainable bio-based and renewable materials, such as biopolymers and natural extracts [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass is an ideal source to obtain biopolymers and antioxidant natural compounds. In fact,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 866. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15040866 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 866 2 of 21\nbiopolymers and polyphenolic compounds isolated from different plant biomasses have already demonstrated their potential for use in the food packaging industry [6\u201310]. Cellulose and nanocellulose from different sources (vine shoot, wheat straw, or eucalyptus sawdust, among others) have been used for the preparation of biocomposite films [11\u201313]. Lignin and hemicelluloses have been successfully applied as natural additives in food packaging materials [14\u201316]. In this context, research has also been conducted in recent years on the preparation of absorbent pads from natural biopolymers for food packaging [1,17]. Fonseca et al. prepared aerogels from corn starch with pinh\u00e3o coat extract that showed a high capacity for water absorption and as carriers of phenolic compounds [18]. Along the same lines, de Oliveira et al. prepared bioactive aerogels with desirable properties for food packaging from cellulose and nanocellulose isolated from yerba-mate [19]. Among natural polymers, chitosan has received special attention in recent years due to its excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, as well as its non-toxic and antimicrobial properties [20]. On the other hand, aerogels have also emerged in recent years as relevant materials due to the characteristics they offer. Aerogels are materials obtained from a gel from which the fluid is removed through its pores, resulting in very specific physical properties such as low density, very high porosity, and high specific surface area [21]. However, chitosan aerogels have some shortcomings such as low porosity, irregular structure, and easy deformation, thus limiting their applications [22,23]. These drawbacks could be overcome by reinforcing the chitosan aerogel with another biopolymer having the desired characteristics. Cellulose nanofibers are a very attractive candidate for the preparation of aerogels due to their physical and chemical properties (high strength, adaptable pores, and modifiable surface properties), in addition to their abundant availability [24]. As previously mentioned, cellulose is the main biopolymer present in lignocellulosic biomass and, therefore, in agricultural residues that need to be revalued to achieve a circular economy. Besides this, numerous studies have reported the importance of the presence or absence of residual lignin in fibers for various applications from fiberboard production to the preparation of PLA or PVA biocomposites [12,25,26]. The presence of residual lignin presents some beneficial advantages for the food packaging industry, such as lower hydrophilicity, high dispersion and reinforcing capacity, and lower energy and economic requirements in its production since no additional pulp bleaching process is needed [27,28]. On the other hand, the presence of lignin increases the roughness and gives a dark color to the fibers but also increases the antioxidant power due to the aromatic structure of lignin [12]. The use of lignin-free fibers results in a brighter, cleaner pulp, free of shavings and bark. The ligninfree fibers can swell more freely, increasing their flexibility and malleability [26]. However, no studies have reported the effect of the presence of residual lignin in nanocellulose for absorbing food pads. In this context, the idea of using BTPW to obtain polyphenolic compounds, which serve as bioactive compounds, and nanocellulose, which serves as a reinforcing agent and structure and performance improver, through multi-product biorefinery processes for the formulation of chitosan-based aerogels is explored. The bay tree (Laurus nobilis) is an abundant softwood in the Mediterranean area whose purposes, in addition to the culinary, have been oriented to the application of its essential oils in cosmetics or medicine, leaving unused a large amount of residue. Previously, the valorization of this biomass has been addressed in terms of its natural extracts and hemicelluloses [15,29,30]. However, as far as the authors know, the purification of cellulose from bay tree pruning waste has not been addressed. Thus, in the first stage, the present work deals with the obtention of cellulose micro/nanofibers from bay tree pruning waste, conducting a proper characterization and evaluation of their use as a reinforcing agent for chitosan aerogels, considering the effect of residual lignin in the fibers. Subsequently, these aerogels have been functionalized with bay leaf extract, whose beneficial properties in food packaging materials have been previously reported [31]. Lastly, the antioxidant capacity of the bioactive aerogels was tested together with their application as absorbing pads for meat preservation in burger samples. As\nPolymers 2023, 15, 866 3 of 21\npreviously discussed, the presence or absence of residual lignin in cellulose nanofibers results in usable properties for food packaging composites. So far, no studies have been conducted on the effect of this residual lignin in bioactive absorbent food pads. The use of lignocellulose micro/nanofibers (LCMNFs) from unbleached cellulose pulp applied in these materials could lead to an increase in water absorption capacity and antioxidant power due to the presence of lignin, in addition to being a more economical and environmentally friendly process that does not require a bleaching step. On the other hand, the use of cellulose micro/nanofibers (CMNFs) obtained from bleached cellulose pulp could result in more flexible materials that are easier to functionalize with bioactive compounds. For these reasons, in the present work, it was decided to simultaneously study BTPW-LCMNFs and CMNFs."

The samples were then sealed with parafilm and refrigerated at 4 \u25e6C for 10 days [1]. Control samples were prepared using commercial meat pads. The ability of the bioactive aerogels to prevent meat oxidation was determined as a direct function of meat discoloration by measuring the proportion of oxymyoglobin and metmyoglobin forms as described by Fontes-Candia et al. with some modifications [1].

After subjecting BTPW to a soda pulping process, optimized for maximum extraction yield using relatively mild procedures, unbleached cellulose pulp (UBP) was obtained. For this fraction, an increase from 48.42% to 72.23% in the carbohydrate fraction (sum of \u03b1-cellulose and hemicelluloses) compared to the raw material was determined, due to the purification of the cellulose fibers in the pulping process and a major part of hemicelluloses remaining [25]. After the bleaching process, the carbohydrate content was further increased (80.36%) due to the removal of a large proportion of the lignin in the bleached pulp (BP). The lignin content in UBP was 20.65 \u00b1 1.13%, while after the bleaching step, it was 9.01 \u00b1 0.21%. UBP showed a fiber length of 1514 nm, while BP was slightly shorter (1050 nm) with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 530 and 421, respectively, being attributed to the degradation of the fiber during the bleaching process. The BTPW cellulose fibers thus obtained resulted in similar characteristics to those reported for other agricultural residues such as olive pruning or tomato, bell pepper, and eggplant horticultural residues, in which a carbohydrate purification of almost 70% was achieved under the same pulping conditions [41,42]. The resulting BTPW-LCMNFs and CMNFs were characterized in terms of SEM (Figure S1), nanofibrillation yield, CD, and CC, and these data were used for the estimation of the specific surface area, diameter, polymerization degree, and length of the fibers. Several authors have previously reported these parameters as good indicators of the LCMNF and CMNF quality [43]. The nanofibrillation yield (\u03b7, Table 2) for LCMNFs\nPolymers 2023, 15, 866 8 of 21\nwas 48%, while for CMNFs, it was 58%. The lower performance in LCMNFs is associated with the presence of lignin, which causes interference during TEMPO-mediated oxidation, leading to secondary oxidation reactions [44].\nCD represents the ability of the fibers to interact with their environment; therefore, a high CD value leads us to expect a higher electrostatic interaction between the nanofibers (anionic compound) and the chitosan (cationic compound). Regarding CD, there is a notable increase from LCMNFs to CMNFs (from 759 \u00b5eq/g to 1349 \u00b5eq/g). This lower CD in LCMNFs is directly related to the lower efficiency of the pretreatment on these fibers due to the high lignin content that decreases the amount of carboxyl groups introduced and a lower nanofibrillation, leading, in addition, to larger diameters in LCMNFs (Table 2). Similar values have been reported for LCMNFs from unbleached soda/oxygen sawdust pine pulp and CMNFs from commercial bleached kraft pine pulp. The same trend was observed for nanofibrillation yield of LCMNFs that was lower than CMNFs (55% and 62%, respectively) and for CD (899 and 1231 \u00b5eq/g, respectively) [45]. The DP of both LCMNFs and CMNFs was substantially decreased compared to the initial fiber, as was the length. It should be mentioned that the bleaching process affects the DP and therefore the length of the fibers, hence the decreased values in CMNFs. Thus, the characteristics of BTPW-LCMNFs and CMNFs were similar to those reported for other softwoods such as those obtained from dried softwood (e.g., spruce) [46]. Finally, the success of the procedures carried out was verified by analyzing the chemical structure of all the fractions by FTIR. The peak at 1600 cm\u22121 in LCMNFs and CMNFs assigned to the carboxyl groups after TEMPO-mediated oxidation, the peak at 1511 cm\u22121 related to the aromatic ring vibrations of lignin in the UBP and LCMNF spectra, and the peaks at 1026 cm\u22121 and 895 cm\u22121 indicative of cellulose purity were observed (Figure S2). The latter was corroborated by the XRD patterns (Figure S2), where the two peaks attributed to the diffraction planes of (1\u201310)/(110) and (200), which represent the typical cellulose I crystal form, were present [47]."

Thus, when glutaraldehyde is not present, the diffractogram of the 100% CH aerogel corresponds to a typical polymeric amorphous structure. However, when the crosslinker agent is included, numerous peaks are observed, indicating in general the disappearance of the amorphous structures and the internal structure of the aerogel being ordered in some way to result in more crystalline materials. Regarding the FTIR spectra, some authors have suggested that the peak at 1550 cm\u22121 occurs as result of the appearance of amide bonds due to the crosslinking action between glutaraldehyde and CH [50]. However, this peak has been observed in 100% CH aerogels regardless of whether or not they were formulated with glutaraldehyde. Therefore, it is suggested that the interaction between CH and LCMNF/CMNF is by hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interaction since no detectable new functional groups appear. No new peaks were observed when the CH matrix was enhanced with LCMNFs or CMNFs.

No new peaks were observed when the CH matrix was enhanced with LCMNFs or CMNFs. Therefore, these analyses indicated a correct crosslinking reaction between the different components of the aerogels without a modification of the basic chemical structure of the material upon addition of the BTPW fractions. The morphology of the aerogels was examined using SEM, and representative images are given in Figure S4. The 100% CH aerogel exhibited an open pore network structure that was smoothed and homogenized when reinforced with both LCMNFs and CMNFs. No phase separation was observed, indicating good cohesion in the structure and successful crosslinking.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 866 10 of 21\nCH aerogels have weak mechanical performance, thus limiting their application. However, biomass-derived CNFs have proven to increase the mechanical strength in CH matrices [49]. In this study, it was observed how adding BTPW-LCMNFs strengthened the CH matrix starting at 3%, reaching the maximum reinforcing effect at 5% (18.41 kPa) compared to 100% CH (12.54 kPa). Higher LCMNF ratios (7\u201310%) did not imply a matrix reinforcing effect (Figure 2a). As previously mentioned, residual lignin in LCMNFs has been proven to be responsible for the high dispersion and reinforcing capacity in composite materials. Interestingly, the reinforcing effect was much greater when CMNFs were incorporated. Thus, CMNF aerogels increased their compressive strength with 3\u20137% CMNF (29.28\u201336.27 kPa). At 10% CMNF, this reinforcing effect is lost, possibly due to a collapse in the structure. The higher specific surface area achieved in CMNFs because it does not contain residual lignin compared to LCMNFs is responsible for this higher reinforcing capacity. As reported by Zhang et al. (2021) for anisotropic cellulose nanofiber/chitosan aerogels, nanofibers entangle into a 3D network more easily when lignin is not present, resulting in stronger adhesion and crosslinking between molecules [24]. In addition, the increase in Young\u2019s modulus of CMNF-CH aerogels compared to 100% CH (Figure S5) suggests a higher elasticity of the materials, attributed to increased crosslinking, which is suitable for applications requiring flexible materials [51]. The strain\u2013stress curves (Figure 2b,c) show how, at the beginning of the test, there is a slight increase in stress under compression due to the collapse of the porous structure forming a plateau region. When the strain increases above 40\u201350%, the stress begins to increase sharply due to the complete collapse of the cellular structures of the porous materials, forming a dense structure to resist deformation. This behavior is typical of foam-type materials [52\u201354]. In the case of CMNF aerogels, the maximum stress at 80% strain was 30\u201333 kPa for 3, 5, and 7% CMNF. Lower or higher concentrations of BTPW-CMNFs in the structure did not result in a reinforcing effect. The fact that the reinforcing effect is greater with CMNFs than with LCMNFs can again be attributed to the presence of lignin in LCMNFs. It has been recently reported that the presence of lignin interferes with the primary activator (NaClO) during the bleaching process, resulting in aerogels with poorer mechanical properties [44]. Some authors have reported that a higher aspect ratio of CMNFs results in a higher Young\u2019s modulus of the aerogels when the content of crosslinker employed is less than that of micro/nanofibers [55]. BTPW-CMNFs exhibited a higher aspect ratio than BTPW-LCMNFs, thus confirming this explanation (Table 2).\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 22\ndifferent components of the aerogels without a modification of the basic chemical structure of the material upon addition of the BTPW fractions.

(a) Compressive strength, (b) stress-strain curves of the prepared LCMNF-CH and (c) CMNF-CH aerogels.\nWith the aerogels aimed to be applied in food packaging absorbent pads, a very porous structure with high absorption capacity is desired. The high porosity of aerogels containing LCMNFs and CMNFs has been previously proven. The results of the study of water and oil absorption capacity of aerogels are shown in Figure 3. In the case of water absorption, the incorporation of BTPW-LCMNFs into the CH matrix led to an increase in the absorption capacity. The maximum absorption capacities were reached with 3% LCMNF (62.12 g water/g aerogel) and 5% LCMNF (60.26 g water/g aerogel). When higher amounts were added, the water absorption capacity considerably decreased. Fontes-Candia et al. reported that high cellulose contents in the aerogel lead to the formation of stronger hydrogen bonding networks that decrease water uptake [1]. The values obtained in this study were slightly higher than those obtained for aerogels containing Arundo donax cellulose fractions and similar to those obtained for corn starch aerogels intended for active food packaging [1,18]. Only modified cellulose aerogels have higher water absorption capacities [24]. For CMNF aerogels, the maximum absorption capacity was reached at 5% (53.37% g water/g aerogel), being in all cases slightly lower than when LCMNFs were used. It is known that lignin is a hydrophobic fraction, and its presence in the fibers contributes to a lower hydrophilicity of the aerogels, thus decreasing water uptake [56]. However, in the case of BTPW-LCMNFs, it seems that the residual lignin contributes to a higher compatibility of the aerogels with water, since in the case of CMNFs, a more purified cellulose fraction, less hydroxyl groups would remain available in the aerogel pores due to a strong self-association [1]. In fact, the CD of CMNFs compared to LCMNFs (1349.02 \u00b5eq/g and 759.98 \u00b5eq/g, respectively) supports this theory, as previously mentioned in mechanical performance.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\nSt re\nss (k\nPa )\nStrain (%)\n100% CH 1% LCMNF 3% LCMNF\n5% LCMNF 7% LCMNF 10% LCMNF\n0 5\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n0 20 40 60 80\nSt re\nss (k\nPa )\nStrain (%)\n100%CH 1% CMNF 3% CMNF\n5% CMNF 7% CMNF 10% CMNF\nFigure 2.

In the case of LCMNF aerogels, oil absorption slightly increases with LCMNF content in low proportions (1\u2013 5%). This behavior could be attributed to a uniform alignment of numerous pores as a result of the increased dispersion due to the presence of residual lignin, which allows rapid liquid absorption and provides a large volume for storage of the absorbed liquids. When oil-absorbent materials are designed, absorption capacities reach 250 g/g [24]. When the aerogels were formulated with CMNFs, no significant differences were found in the concentration range 1\u20137%, the oil absorption capacity being 20\u201330 g oil/g aerogel. Therefore, the results obtained for the present aerogels suggest their suitability for absorption in hydrophilic matrices. As mentioned above, when aerogels are designed to be food pads, they are required to be highly porous and absorbent. In the aerogels prepared so far, effective crosslinking between BTPW-LCMNFs or CMNFs and CH has been demonstrated, in addition to high porosity at all ratios studied (>99%). Moreover, a maximum reinforcing effect of the CH matrix was achieved with 5% LCMNF (23.41% improvement) and 3\u20137% CMNF (89.07% improvement), attributing these differences between LCMNFs and CMNFs to the higher aspect ratio of BTPW-CMNFs. Finally, the high water absorption capacity of the aerogels increased with 3\u20135% LCMNF and 5% CMNF. For oil absorption, the improvement over CH was achieved with 5% LCMNF.

Thus, these aerogels exhibited a water uptake capacity of 61.17, 64.85, and 73.25 g water/g aerogel for 5, 10, and 20% BT, respectively, compared to 56.74 g water/g aerogel for 5% LCMNF. In the case of bioactive CMNF-formulated aerogels, a similar trend was observed, reaching the water uptake value of the reference with 10% BT. Kanmani and Rhim reported a slight increase in the water uptake ability of composite films when incorporating grapefruit seed extract, suggesting that it is due to the presence of groups with greater affinity to bind water molecules [57]. Similar behavior has also been reported for CH composites incorporating carvacrol and grapefruit seed extract [58]. As was the case with LCMNF-reinforced aerogels, the water uptake capacity was higher than with CMNF aerogels, corroborating the higher self-association of the fibers in the absence of residual lignin. This effect is even more remarkable when the aerogels are formulated with BT because, in the LCMNF aerogels, more BT will be retained, and therefore water will be retained both in the hydrophilic domains of BT and in the non-self-associated LCMNF due to the presence of lignin. In the case of soybean oil, absorption followed a similar trend, with maximum absorption values when the aerogels were formulated with 10% BT (50.29 and 46.29 g oil/g aerogel for LCMNF and CMNF, respectively).

Evaluation of the Bioactive Capacity of BTPW-CH Aerogels for Meat Preservation The antioxidant capacity of the bioactive aerogels was evaluated as scavenging activity (%SA) by means of the DPPH assay prolonged in time, as a direct indicator of the release rate of the extract to the medium (Figure 6). For LCMNF aerogels, an increasing antioxidant power (%SA at 30 min) is observed as the concentration of BT in the aerogel increases. The 5% LCMNF aerogel exhibited 7.04, 52.38, and 69.86% SA for 0.5, 24, and 48 h, respectively, derived from the residual lignin content in LCMNFs, with an aromatic structure that acts as an antioxidant agent preventing or retarding oxidation processes induced by oxidizing species, such as free radicals [12]. Based on the behavior of the LCMNF aerogels in this test, they can be divided into two groups, those with \u22642% BT and those with \u22655% BT. Thus, the aerogels with low BT concentration in the matrix presented approximately 9, 13, 16, and 24% SA at 30 min of testing for 0.3, 0.7, 1, and 2% BT, respectively. During the first day of assay (0\u201324 h), it is shown how slowly the proportional release of BT to the medium (and therefore an increase of %SA) is taking place. After 48 h of testing, it could be said that aerogels containing 0.7\u20132% BT reached the maximum release and therefore scavenging activity (88\u201391% SA)."

The 5% LCMNF aerogel exhibited 7.04, 52.38, and 69.86% SA for 0.5, 24, and 48 h, respectively, derived from the residual lignin content in LCMNFs, with an aromatic structure that acts as an antioxidant agent preventing or retarding oxidation processes induced by oxidizing species, such as free radicals [12]. Based on the behavior of the LCMNF aerogels in this test, they can be divided into two groups, those with \u22642% BT and those with \u22655% BT. Thus, the aerogels with low BT concentration in the matrix presented approximately 9, 13, 16, and 24% SA at 30 min of testing for 0.3, 0.7, 1, and 2% BT, respectively. During the first day of assay (0\u201324 h), it is shown how slowly the proportional release of BT to the medium (and therefore an increase of %SA) is taking place. After 48 h of testing, it could be said that aerogels containing 0.7\u20132% BT reached the maximum release and therefore scavenging activity (88\u201391% SA). In the case of LCMNF aerogels containing high proportions of BT (5\u201320% BT), certain differ nces are observed in this b havior. After only 30 min of testing, 46.60, 78.92, and 86.95% SA were obtained for 5, 10, and 20% BT, respectively. For these aerogels, the BT release rate w s much faster than in the previous ones. The 5% BT aerogel exhibited 61.86, 75.39, and 85.04% SA for 1, 2, and 3 h of assay, whi e from 4 h and up to 48 h, the %SA was at maximum. For 10% BT and 20% BT aerogels, the %SA was at maximum from 1 h of ssay, indicating the even faster rate of BT release. These differences between aerogels with low and high BT ratios can be attributed to the fact that, at low ratios, there is less availability of extract to interact with DPPH because it is interacting with LCMNF in the ae gel matrix, whil at high BT ratios, all the free hyd oxyl groups of LCMNFs for interaction with BT would have already been filled, leaving BT still free to scaveng the DPPH r dical which translates into higher %SA at shorter test times [19]. Bioactive CMNF aerogels showed a very similar behavior pattern to LCMNF aerogels with some slight differences. Thus, it is observed that, in the case of aerogels with high proportions of BT, the total release of the extract in the first hours of the test is done at a slightly lower rate than in LCMNF aerogels. For example, 10% BT CMNF exhibited 60.04 and 73.43% SA for 1 and 2 h trial, respectively, while 10% BT LCMNF exhibited 85.26 and 87.62% SA for 1 and 2 h trial, respectively. However, it is seen how at 24 h of assay, the %SA and, therefore, the release of the extract, is practically maximal for any proportion of BT in the CMNF aerogel matrix (0.3\u201320% BT). According to the results reported by Fontes-Candia et al., this behavior is explained by several facts. First, in the early stages of the assay, the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 866 16 of 21\nrelease is more prominent for aerogels with a lower purified cellulose fraction (LCMNFs) due to the morphology of these aerogels. The results obtained for the absorption capacity of these samples were also higher than for CMNF aerogels because of the presence of residual lignin. This contributed to the faster release of the extract, which resulted in an increase in %SA at earlier stages. On the other hand, results for the bioactive CMNF aerogels had suggested a stronger BT\u2013CMNF interaction, resulting in a slower release of the extract [1]. In addition to this, it is known that the specific surface area is one of the most important parameters controlling the dissolution rate of compounds and their absorption. Composite materials with high surface areas result in a slower and more gradual release profile, which is very interesting for food preservation and active packaging [19,61]. Thus, BTPW-CMNFs presented a higher specific surface than BTPW-LCMNFs (Table 2), supporting the release behavior found. In any case, the BT extract presents a polyphenol-rich profile with high antioxidant capacity [29], being possible to suggest that polymeric matrices loaded with BT, such as the ones that compose the present aerogels, present a great potential for the formulation of food preservatives and nutraceuticals.

In the case of this study, when burger meat was stored ith the LCMNF pads, there was a slight increase in the proportion of oxymyoglobin for 5% LCMNF, 0.3% BT, 0.7% BT, and 1% BT, compared to the control sample. The most important fact was that for BT concentrations \u22652%, the proportion of oxymyoglobin in the meat was the same as that obtained in the fresh meat on day 0 of the trial, highlighting the great potential of these materials to limit oxidation processes in meat foods. When the meat was refrigerated with the CMNF pads, the same trend was observed with the difference that the 5% CMNF pad did not lead to an increase in the proportion of oxymyoglobin with respect to the control sample, as was the case with 5% LCMNF. This indicates that the presence of residual lignin in LCMNFs is contributing to this food maintenance, as suggested by the %SA result for this aerogel. Finally, differences were observed between pads reinforced with LCMNFs or CMNFs containing high concentrations of the extract (10\u201320% BT). Thus, for LCMNF pads, the results obtained were the same as those mentioned above for BT concentrations \u22652% BT; the proportion of oxymyoglobin remained similar to that of the fresh meat on day 0. However, for CMNF pads, the proportion of oxymyoglobin was somehow in line with that of the samples containing low concentrations of BT (0.3\u20131% BT). Maybe, for these CMNF-pads, the bioactive fraction has been released to the medium too fast, hindering on the one hand the correct absorption of the meat exudate and on the other hand not carrying out its antioxidative effect."

            "text": "The present study has addressed the preparation of absorbent food pads in the context of agricultural residues biorefinery. For this purpose, bay tree pruning waste (BTPW) has\nPolymers 2023, 15, 866 18 of 21\nbeen used for the production of lignocellulose and cellulose micro/nanofibers (LCMNF and CMNF). CMNFs were obtained with higher cationic demand and aspect ratio (1349 \u00b5eq/g and 132.90, respectively) compared to LCMNFs (759 \u00b5eq/g and 96.65, respectively). These are key factors when applying these fractions in food pads, as they are directly related to the mechanical performance and absorption properties. LCMNF and CMNF were applied as reinforcing agents in chitosan aerogels in order to elucidate the optimal formulation to be applied as food pads, together with the evaluation of the presence of residual lignin. Although the use of LCMNFs resulted in an optimal reinforcing effect at 5%, it was considerably greater (80% improvement) when using CMNFs. The absence of residual lignin in the latter seems to have contributed to a stronger self-association between the fibers, increasing the compressive strength. On the other hand, the presence of residual lignin in LCMNF aerogels was decisive in increasing the water absorption capacity of the materials, which reached their maximum with 3\u20135% LCMNF (62.12 and 60.26 g water/g aerogel). The 5% LCMNF and 5% CMNF aerogels were selected as the optimal formulation. These aerogels were prepared with bay leaf extracts (BT) to make them bioactive. The study of the antioxidant capacity of the aerogels prolonged in time, as a direct indicator of the release rate of BT to the medium, proved that the presence of residual lignin led to a faster increase in antioxidant power in the first hours of the assay (80% antioxidant power in 30 min). In both cases, aerogels showed great potential for the formulation of active food packaging materials. Finally, the use of these bioactive aerogels as absorbent pads for burger meat resulted in a maintenance of the freshness of the meat product after 10 days of storage. Again, the residual lignin present was a key factor since, in the case of 5% LCMNF pads, this retardation of meat oxidation was obtained with lower amounts of BT in the formulation as a result of a synergistic effect between the residual lignin and the extract.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15040866/s1, Figure S1: SEM micrographs of (a) unbleached cellulose pulp, (b) bleached cellulose pulp and (c) nanofibrillation process of the fiber; Figure S2: FTIR spectra (a) and XRD patterns (b) of bay tree pruning unbleached and bleached pulp, lignocellulose micro/nanofibers (LCMNF) and cellulose micro/nanofibers (CMNF); Figure S3: FTIR spectra (a,b) and XRD patterns (c,d) of 100% CH, LCMNF-CH and CMNF-CH aerogels; Figure S4: SEM images of (a) 100% CH, (b) 5% LCMNF, (c) 5% CMNF, and (d) LCMNF + 20% BT aerogels; Figure S5: Young\u2019s Modulus of reinforced-CH aerogels; Figure S6: FTIR spectra of bioactive aerogels; Figure S7: Mechanical properties of bioactive aerogels.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.R., E.E. and L.S.; methodology, E.R.; formal analysis, E.R. and M.P.; data curation, E.R. and M.P.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, E.R. and E.E.; writing\u2014 review and editing, E.R., E.E. and L.S.; supervision, E.E. and L.S.
