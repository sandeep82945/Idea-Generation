 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore other linkage methods for hierarchical clustering besides complete and Ward linkage. The paper showed pros and cons of different methods, so researching new linkage approaches could lead to better clustering and segmentation.

2. Apply the methodology to other network performance metrics besides delay, such as loss, jitter, throughput. The general framework could work for clustering and segmenting different time series data. 

3. Develop more sophisticated transition probability models for the Viterbi algorithm to better capture dynamics and temporal dependency. The simple model in the paper could be enhanced.

4. Evaluate the approach on more diverse and larger real-world datasets. The methodology was tested on two datasets, so expanding the evaluation would be useful.

5. Incorporate external factors like network events into the model to improve segmentation alignment. Knowledge of incidents could help guide the clustering and hidden states.
