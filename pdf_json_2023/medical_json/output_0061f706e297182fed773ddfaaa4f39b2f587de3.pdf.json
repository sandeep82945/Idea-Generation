    "abstractText": "The effect of casein savinase hydrolysate (CSH) usage on frozen dough (1%, 1.5% and 2%, g/100 g flour) was investigated in terms of rheological, thermal and structural characteristics of wheat doughs and the textural and color properties of corresponding breads. Rheological measurements showed that CSH addition into dough led to a reduction in G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values, but a similar trend was not observed in frozen dough samples. The increase in protein band intensity was observed for control dough (CD) after frozen storage (\u221230 \u25e6C, 28 days), while there were no increases in the band intensities of the doughs with CSH. The freezable water content of unfrozen doughs decreased gradually with the addition of CSH, dependent on concentration level. Frozen storage caused a notable reduction in the \u03b1-helices structure of the CD sample (p < 0.05) while no significant variation was observed for the doughs containing CSH (p > 0.05). The lowest specific volume reduction and hardness increment were observed for the breads containing 1.5% and 2% CSH. Frozen storage caused a significant reduction in the b* value of bread crust (p < 0.05), while no significant effect was observed for L* and a* value during frozen storage (p > 0.05). Overall, CSH incorporation into frozen dough can be an alternative that could reduce the quality deterioration of frozen bread.",

            "text": "Milk proteins are frequently preferred in the development of biological characteristics of foods because of their high digestibility features and abundant essential amino acid content [1]. They are also considered to be a fundamental dietary component due to their balanced and adequate nutrient content. In addition to the superior bioactive properties they provide, milk proteins also enable technological characteristics such as emulsion, oil\u2013water retention capacity and texture [2,3]. In recent years, the importance of healthy and functional ingredients has become more widely accepted, leading to an increased demand for improving the functional characteristics of frequently consumed nutrients. This demand has generated food products with peptides containing much more biologically qualified and active components. Enriching food items with low protein content, such as bakery products, and especially bread, with milk protein and its hydrolysates can significantly increase their nutritional value [4]. The enzymatic hydrolysis-based modification of milk proteins has significant potential as a tool in food protein processing to optimize the technofunctional, biological and nutritional properties of proteins [5]. Casein hydrolyzed formulations have been sold for many years due to their exceptional nutritional content, amino acid composition, commercial availability in huge numbers, and affordable price [6]. Casein hydrolysates can be used to enhance the nutritional value, stability, shelf life, and many other characteristics of various food products, as well as protein supplements [7]. The use of frozen dough in bread and bakery products has been increasing. Basic factors like shelf life and bakery quality may be regulated with the use of frozen dough,\nFoods 2023, 12, 3845. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12203845 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 3845 2 of 12\nand at the same time it enables the production of huge quantities of dough, ease of storage and transportation, and the production of fresh products in small and medium-sized enterprises [8]. It is known that the freezing and thawing process in the production of frozen bread damages the gluten network [9] and prevents the bread from rising, thus causing low volume and harder crumb formation [10,11]. Some proteins and their hydrolysates have been used in several studies to eliminate these quality deteriorations. The effects of milk protein [12], pigskin gelatin [13] and sweet potato protein hydrolysates [14] on the quality of breads made from frozen dough have been investigated. In a study of Zhou et al. [15], desalted egg white and gelatin mixture systems provided a positive effect on the quality of frozen dough by slowing down the increase in the freezable water content and the loss tangent (tan\u03b4) value. Also, a cryo-protective effect of ice-binding peptides derived from collagen hydrolysates was reported by Cao et al. [16]. Additionally, casein hydrolysate could be an alternative for frozen dough quality improvements thanks to its inexpensive and efficient production. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the contributions of casein hydrolysates produced from savinase to frozen dough and corresponding bread quality in this study. To realize this aim, the rheological, thermal and protein analyses (SDS-PAGE and secondary structure) were studied alongside the quality of breads made from frozen dough."

The loss factor, tan \u03b4, was also shown to reflect the viscoelasticity of samples. For all samples, the G\u2032 was greater than G\u2032\u2032, showing that the dough was more elastic and exhibited solid-like behavior [22]. CSH addition into the dough led to a reduction in G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values, but a similar trend was not observed in frozen dough samples. Frozen storage decreased the G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values of all dough samples, and control dough (CD) had the lowest value. The same behavior was shown in G\u2032\u2032 values. Also, the decreasing effect of frozen storage on dough containing 2% was lower than that in other doughs with CSH (1% HD and 1.5% HD) (Figure 1B). These results indicated that CSH addition caused a detrimental effect due to lowering G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 and increasing tan \u03b4 values in a fresh dough system. According to the study of Khatkar et al. [23], the flour from wheat, showing good bread quality, had a higher G\u2032 value and lower tan \u03b4. On the other hand, the addition of CSH improved the gluten strength of frozen dough when compared to control-frozen dough (CFD), as a result of elevated G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 values [24]. A similar observation was reported by Zhou et al. [15] for a frozen dough system containing a desalted egg white and gelatin mixture. In the dynamic rheological measurement of the frozen dough system, tan \u03b4 value (G\u2032\u2032/G\u2032) is considered an important parameter to monitor the viscoelasticity of dough [22]. The tan \u03b4 values obtained in this study were lower than 1, indicating that the elasticity of the samples was greater than the viscosity [15]. Frozen storage resulted in a remarkable increase in tan \u03b4 for all samples (Figure 1C). The increment of the tan \u03b4 value during freezing has previously been reported by many studies [14,15]. This was attributed to the gradual increase in ice crystals during freezing, causing damage to the gluten network and subsequently resulting in an increased viscosity of the dough. The rise of tan \u03b4 in dough with CSH was lower than CD after frozen storage (Figure 1C). This can be explained by slowing the ice crystal growth due to the addition of CSH.\nFoods 2023, 12, 3845 5 of 12\nFoods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 11\n(Figure 1C).

SDS-PAGE Analysis The changes in SDS-PAGE patterns of proteins with the incorporation of casein hy-\ndrolyzate during frozen storage are presented in Figure 2. The formation of new bands and/or changes in band intensities showed polymerization/depolymerization behavior in the gluten network [25\u201327]. Depolymerization exists in the protein matrix of wheat dough when exposed to frozen conditions [26]. The increase in protein band intensity was observed for control dough (CD) after frozen storage (CFD), indicating that a depolymerization of the high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) region occurred. Similar results were previously reported by numerous studies for wheat dough under frozen conditions [13,28,29]. As for the samples including casein hydrolyzate, no depolymerization was observed due to frozen storage as there was no increases in band intensities, except for the 2% HD sample (Figure 2B). The 2% casein hydrolyzate addition increased the band intensity after frozen storage, showing that this level of addition may inhibit the crosslinking of SDS-insoluble proteins and interact with SDS-soluble proteins [13]. The incorporation of unhydrolyzed pigskin gelatin at 1% level also resulted in an increase in band intensity corresponding to the \u03c9-gliadins region in a study by Yu et al. [13], who suggested that pigskin gelatin contributed to the formation of aggregates through noncovalent interactions. The inclusion of casein hydrolyzate in the wheat dough matrix led to a decrease in band intensities in the HMW-GS region when compared to CD. This can show that new interactions between glutenin, casein hydrolyzate and water were formed during dough processing since band intensity increment was observed in the low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS), \u03b3-gliadin and \u03b1/\u03b2 gliadin regions. Another possible explanation of this can be the formation of protein polymers with a larger size, which"

CSH addition into bread formulation had no remarkable effect on bread quality (p > 0.05).

These phenomena, which have previously been reported in many studies, suggest that during frozen storage ice crystals lead to a decrease in the gas-holding capacity of the dough by destroying the structure of the gluten [14,15]. Also, Cao et al. [16] noted that the fermentation capacity of the dough was influenced by the growth of ice crystals, which decreased the survival of yeast cells. However, the significant effect was shown only in CD and 1%HD after frozen storage (p < 0.05). The lowest SV reduction and hardness increment were observed for the breads\nFigure 4.

The primary impact of frozen storage at \u221230 \u25e6C for 28 days on the bread was a reduction in SV values and an increase in hardness.

However, the significant effect was shown only in CD and 1%HD after frozen storage (p < 0.05). The lowest SV reduction and hardness increment were observed for the breads containing 1.5% and 2% CSH. This can be attributed to the FW (%) content of 1.5%HD and 2%HD samples also being lower than in the CD sample (Figure 3). Mao et al. [31] reported that a reduction in the FW content in frozen dough protected the gluten network by preventing the formation of ice crystals.\nFoods 2023, 12, 3845 9 of 12\nFoods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 11 containing 1.5% and 2% CSH.

[31] reported that a reduction in the FW content in frozen dough protected the gluten network by preventing the formation of ice crystals.\nThe effect of CSH addition and frozen storage (\u221230 \u00b0C, 28 days) on the crust and crumb color of bread samples is shown in Table 2. CSH addition decreased the L* value of the bread crust and a significant reduction was observed for the breads containing 1.5% and 2% CSH when compared to control (p < 0.05). The browning of the bread crust (decrease in L* value) with the addition of CSH as a protein source showed an intensive Maillard reaction compared to the control. In a study which investigated the effect of pigskin gelatin in frozen bread, it was indicated that the browning of the bread crust was due to the addition of pigskin gelatin [13]. Frozen storage caused a significant reduction in the b* value of bread crust (p < 0.05), while no significant effect was observed for L* and a* value during frozen storage (p > 0.05). Similar results for the b* value of the bread crust were also reported by Sharadanant and Khan [32]. In terms of color differences (\u0394E), frozen storage had no significant effect on the \u0394E value of the crust color, but the \u0394E values of 1.5% HFD and 2% HFD were higher than those of other samples (e.g., CFD and 1% HFD). As for the crumb color, frozen storage resulted in the reduction in L* value in the crumb (p < 0.05). A similar trend was also noted by Yu et al. [13] at the end of 60 days of frozen storage (\u221218 \u00b0C). On the other hand, Shon et al. [12] reported that no significant effect was observed for crumb L* value during frozen storage (\u221220 \u00b0C, 60 days). The incorporation of CSH into fresh bread increased the b* value of the bread crumb (p < 0.05). While frozen storage increased the crumb b* value of the control fresh bread (p < 0.05), the breads with CSH were not affected by frozen storage (p > 0.05) in terms of crumb b* value. The bread made of control-frozen dough (CFD) exhibited the highest color differences (\u0394E) in bread crumb when compared to the frozen dough breads containing CSH. This shows that frozen storage caused no significant effect on the breads with CSH in terms of \u0394E in the bread crumb (p < 0.05).\nTable 2.

The frozen dough with CSH did not demonstrate any notable alteration in the structure of \u03b1-helices following frozen storage at \u221230 \u25e6C for 28 days. The results obtained from the dynamic rheological measurement and freezable water content showed that the incorporation of CSH into frozen wheat dough slowed down the ice crystals\u2019 growth. These findings resulted in an amelioration in the bread quality of 1.5% and 2% CSH-containing samples since the lowest specific volume reduction and hardness increment were exhibited. In summary, casein hydrolysate obtained from savinase can be considered as an alternative bakery ingredient for frozen dough systems.\nAuthor Contributions: H.B.: Investigation, data curation, formal analysis, methodology and writing\u2014 original draft.
