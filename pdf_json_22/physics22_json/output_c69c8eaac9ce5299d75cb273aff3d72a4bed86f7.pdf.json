    "abstractText": "We study entanglement properties in a nonequilibrium steady state of a free-fermion chain, that emerges after connecting two half-chains prepared at different temperatures. The entanglement negativity and the R\u00e9nyi mutual information between two adjacent intervals scale logarithmically in the system size, with prefactors that we calculate analytically as a function of the bath temperatures. In particular, we show that the negativity and the R\u00e9nyi mutual information with index \u03b1 = 1/2 are described by different prefactors, and thus the two quantities provide inequivalent information about the state. Furthermore, we show that the logarithmic growth of the negativity during time evolution is also governed by the steady-state prefactor.",

            "text": "Entanglement negativity in a nonequilibrium steady state\nViktor Eisler Institute of Theoretical and Computational Physics,\nGraz University of Technology, Petersgasse 16, 8010 Graz, Austria\nWe study entanglement properties in a nonequilibrium steady state of a free-fermion chain, that emerges after connecting two half-chains prepared at different temperatures. The entanglement negativity and the Re\u0301nyi mutual information between two adjacent intervals scale logarithmically in the system size, with prefactors that we calculate analytically as a function of the bath temperatures. In particular, we show that the negativity and the Re\u0301nyi mutual information with index \u03b1 = 1/2 are described by different prefactors, and thus the two quantities provide inequivalent information about the state. Furthermore, we show that the logarithmic growth of the negativity during time evolution is also governed by the steady-state prefactor.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe study of entanglement properties in many-body systems had a vast contribution to our understanding of quantum phases of matter [1\u20133]. In particular, the structure of entanglement in pure ground states of lattice systems with local interactions is characterized by an area law [4]. In one-dimensional systems, logarithmic violations of the area law signal the criticality of the state, with a prefactor that is universal and described by conformal field theory (CFT) [5].\nDespite the enormous progress for pure states, the characterization of entanglement in mixed states remains a challenge. The core of the problem is finding an efficiently computable measure of entanglement, with a prospective candidate being the logarithmic negativity [6\u20138]. In the quantum field theory framework, the entanglement negativity between two segments can be evaluated in ground [9\u201311] and thermal states [12\u201314] of a 1D chain. These predictions are nicely confirmed by numerical calculations in harmonic and spin chains [15\u201322]. Results for higher dimensional lattices also exist [23\u201326], and the role of negativity in finite-temperature phase transitions has been addressed [27, 28].\nThe studies have also been extended to the out-ofequilibrium scenario, and the time evolution of entanglement negativity was investigated in quantum quenches [29\u201332]. Interestingly, for free-particle chains it has been observed that there is an intimate proportionality relation between the negativity and the Re\u0301nyi mutual information (RMI) with index \u03b1 = 1/2 [33]. Namely, to leading order one finds that the two quantities are related by a factor two, which has been substantiated in a number of other quench scenarios [34\u201337]. In particular, the results of [35] suggest that the relation should hold for rather generic unitary dynamics, provided that the initial state is pure.\nOn the other hand, recent counterexamples were found in the context of non-unitary dissipative dynamics, where the leading order behaviour of negativity and RMI were found to be different [38, 39]. However, this cannot be a completely generic property of mixing dynamics, as the proportionality has been recovered in other non-unitary\ncases [40] and even for random mixed states [41]. Furthermore, the inequivalence of entanglement negativity and RMI has also been pointed out in quench dynamics of irrational CFTs [42, 43]. The above examples clearly demonstrate, that the relation between these two quantities is far from being understood.\nIn this paper we shall provide an example for a mixed state of a free-fermion chain, where the relation between negativity and RMI breaks down. Namely, we consider a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) that emerges under unitary dynamics, after two half-chains at different temperatures are joined together. In the very same setting, the standard mutual information was shown to violate the area law [44], and similar logarithmic violations have been found in the NESS of various other free-fermion related chains [45\u201349]. In sharp contrast, in the analogous NESS of a harmonic chain both the negativity and the mutual information were found to satisfy the area law [12], which is the result dictated by free-boson CFT [50].\nHere we study the RMI with \u03b1 = 1/2 as well as the negativity between two adjacent or disjoint intervals in the fermionic NESS, and show that they both scale logarithmically in the segment size or cross ratio, respectively. However, the prefactors are described by different functions of the temperatures, and hence the two quantities provide inequivalent information about the NESS. Our results are obtained from the Re\u0301nyi generalization of the negativity via an analytic continuation, using the techniques introduced in [37]. The analytical results are in perfect agreement with our numerical calculations. Furthermore, we also provide numerical evidence that the negativity between adjacent intervals grows logarithmically in time during the dynamics, governed by the exact same prefactor found for the NESS.\nThe rest of the manuscript is structured as follows. In Section II we introduce the model and describe the setup. The results for the Re\u0301nyi mutual information as well as for the entanglement negativity are presented in Sec. III and IV, respectively. Our findings are discussed in Sec. V, followed by two appendices with some technical details of the calculations. ar X iv :2\n21 2.\n08 49\n9v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nta t-\nm ec\nh] 1\n6 D\nec 2\n02 2\n2"

For the initial state (2) it has been shown [51\u201353] that the NESS is locally well defined by the requirement\nTr (\u03c1\u221eO) = lim t\u2192\u221e Tr (\u03c1tO) (4)\nfor any observable O supported on a finite set of sites. Furthermore, since \u03c1\u221e is a Gaussian state, it is fully characterized by its correlation matrix\nCmn = Tr (\u03c1\u221ec \u2020 mcn) = \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 dq 2\u03c0 e\u2212iq(m\u2212n)nq, (5)\nwhere the occupation function is given by [52]\nnq =\n{ 1\ne\u2212\u03b2r cos q+1 \u2212\u03c0 < q < 0\n1 e\u2212\u03b2l cos q+1\n0 < q < \u03c0 . (6)\nIn other words, the right-moving fermionic modes are thermalized at the temperature of the left-hand side bath and vice-versa. In fact, the NESS can be understood in a simple hydrodynamic picture, where the non-interacting modes propagate ballistically and carry the information of their initial occupation to large distances.\nThe conventional way of characterizing entanglement is to consider a bipartition of the system into a subsystem A and its environment B, and consider the reduced density matrix \u03c1A = TrB(\u03c1\u221e). However, since the NESS is a mixed state, the von Neumann entropy\nS(\u03c1A) = \u2212Tr (\u03c1A ln \u03c1A) (7)\nis not a proper measure of entanglement. Instead, one could consider a tripartite scenario with subsystems A1, A2 and B, and calculate the mutual information\nI(A1 : A2) = S(\u03c1A1) + S(\u03c1A2)\u2212 S(\u03c1A1\u222aA2) , (8) which is a measure of the total correlations between A1 and A2. For two adjacent intervals, I(A1 : A2) satisfies an area law in thermal equilibrium for arbitrary local Hamiltonians [54]. However, for the NESS at hand it has been shown in [44], that the mutual information violates the area law and scales logarithmically in the subsystem size. This behaviour is due to the jump singularity in the occupation function (6) at q = 0, between\na = 1\ne\u2212\u03b2r + 1 , b =\n1\ne\u2212\u03b2l + 1 , (9)\nwhile a second jump between the values 1\u2212 a and 1\u2212 b occurs at q = \u00b1\u03c0.\nThe mutual information quantifies only the total (quantum + classical) correlations between two subsystems in the NESS. In the following we shall extend the calculations to obtain the logarithmic negativity, which is a proper measure of entanglement [7]. As a first step towards this goal, we study the Re\u0301nyi mutual information, which was shown to have a very close relation to the negativity in the context of quantum quenches [33, 35]. The techniques introduced in the next section will be directly applicable to the calculation of the negativity."

(11)\nIt is completely analogous to the standard mutual information (8), which is reobtained in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 1. For generic \u03b1, however, the RMI is not even a proper measure of correlations. Indeed, for the NESS of a transverse Ising chain emerging from the initial state (2) it has been shown, that the RMI may become negative for indices \u03b1 > 2 [47]. On the other hand, for 0 < \u03b1 < 2 the subadditivity of the Re\u0301nyi entropy was proven for arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, ensuring the positivity of the RMI [55].\nOur main goal is to derive the asymptotics of the RMI with index \u03b1 = 1/2 between two (adjacent or disjoint) intervals of size ` 1. The strategy is to first express the RMI with integer index n > 1 and then perform an analytic continuation. Indeed, for integer values of the Re\u0301nyi index, the entropy can be calculated as [56]\nSn(\u03c1A) = 1\n1\u2212 n\nn\u22121 2\u2211\nk=\u2212n\u221212\nlnZA,k , (12)\n3 where ZA,k is the generating function of the full counting statistics (FCS) of the particle number N\u0302A in A\nZA,k = Tr (\u03c1\u221ee i\u03bbkN\u0302A) = det [ 1A + (e i\u03bbk \u2212 1)CA ] . (13)\nHere 1A is the identity matrix on subsystem A, and the phases must be evaluated at the discrete values\n\u03bbk = 2\u03c0 n k , k = \u2212n\u2212 1 2 , . . . , n\u2212 1 2 . (14)\nNote that the index k takes integer/half-integer values for n odd/even, and CA is the reduced correlation matrix with elements (5) restricted tom,n \u2208 A. While originally obtained via the replica trick in a field theoretic setting [56], Eq. (12) can also be derived immediately using the determinant formula for the Re\u0301nyi entropy of Gaussian states, see Appendix A.\nIn order to obtain the RMI in (10), we need to evaluate the entropies for the intervals A1 and A2, which involves the calculation of determinants (13) of a Toeplitz matrix with a symbol (6) that has a jump singularity [57]. This can be performed using standard Fisher-Hartwig techniques [58, 59] as in [44]. However, for disjoint intervals this is not any more true for the subsystem A1 \u222aA2. To overcome this problem, one can apply a trick that allows us to deal with Toeplitz determinants, at the expense of modifying the occupation function (6). Indeed, the main argument is that the logarithmic contribution of the RMI we are interested in should depend only on the parameters nq\u21920\u2212 = a and nq\u21920+ = b defined in (9). Therefore, we introduce the piecewise constant occupation function\nn\u2032q = { a \u2212\u03c0 < q \u2264 0 b 0 < q \u2264 \u03c0 . (15)\nand the corresponding correlation matrix C \u2032ij = \u2211 q n\u2032q \u03d5 \u2217 q(i)\u03d5q(j) . (16)\nNote that we also regularize the problem by considering sites on a ring of finite size L, such that the momenta q are integer multiples of 2\u03c0/L and the corresponding eigenstates are \u03d5q(j) \u223c eiqj up to normalization. Clearly, the correlation matrix (16) will not reproduce the correct extensive part of the entropy in the NESS, which, however, anyway cancels out in the RMI.\nWe thus proceed with the calculation of the determinant in (13) by exchanging CA \u2192 C \u2032A. Let us first rewrite\nC \u2032A = aC 0 A + b (1A \u2212 C0A) , (17)\nwhere\nC0ij = \u2211 q\u22640 \u03d5\u2217q(i)\u03d5q(j) . (18)\nThen C0A is nothing else but the reduced correlation matrix of a Fermi-sea ground state with all the negative momenta occupied. This is known to have the same eigenvalues as the overlap matrix [60]\nM0pq = \u2211 j\u2208A \u03d5\u2217p(j)\u03d5q(j) . (19)\nwhere the sum runs over the subsystem A and the momentum indices are restricted to the Fermi sea, p, q \u2264 0. The FCS can thus be rewritten as\nZA,k = det [1 +M ] det [ (1\u2212 b+ b ei\u03bbk)1A ] , (20)\nwhere\nMpq = (a\u2212 b)(ei\u03bbk \u2212 1) 1 + b(ei\u03bbk \u2212 1) M 0 pq , (21)\nand 1 is the identity over the Fermi sea in momentum space.\nIt is easy to see that the matrix M with elements defined in (21) has a Toeplitz structure for arbitrary subsystems A. For simplicity, we consider two disjoint intervals of equal length A1 = [1, `] and A2 = [d+ `+ 1, d+ 2`], by keeping the ratios d/L and `/L fixed. Introducing \u03b8 = 2\u03c0j/L and taking the thermodynamic limit L\u2192\u221e, one obtains the integral\n(1 +M)pq = \u222b 2\u03c0 0 \u03c6A(\u03b8)e \u2212i(p\u2212q)\u03b8d\u03b8 , (22)\nwith a piecewise constant symbol \u03c6A(\u03b8) that depends on the parameters a, b and the phase \u03bbk. In particular, for a single interval one has\n\u03c6A1(\u03b8) = { \u03a6(\u03bbk) 0 < \u03b8 < \u03b81 1 \u03b81 < \u03b8 < 2\u03c0 , (23)\nwhere\n\u03a6(\u03bb) = 1\u2212 a+ ei\u03bba 1\u2212 b+ ei\u03bbb , (24)\nand the two jump singularities are located at\n\u03b80 = 0 , \u03b81 = 2\u03c0`\nL . (25)\nOn the other hand, for the composite subsystem A1\u222aA2 we have the symbol\n\u03c6A1\u222aA2(\u03b8) = { \u03a6(\u03bbk) \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03b81] \u222a [\u03b82, \u03b83] 1 otherwise , (26)\nwith additional jump locations at\n\u03b82 = 2\u03c0(d+ `)\nL , \u03b83 =\n2\u03c0(d+ 2`)\nL . (27)\n4 One can now apply the Fisher-Hartwig theorem to evaluate the Toeplitz determinant in (20). Indeed, let us rewrite the symbol in the form \u03c6A(\u03b8) = \u220f s gs(\u03b8) where\ngs(\u03b8) = { ei\u03c0\u03b2s 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03b8s e\u2212i\u03c0\u03b2s \u03b8s \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0 , (28)\nand s labels the FH singularities. The logarithm of the L/2\u00d7 L/2 Toeplitz determinant then reads [61]\nln det(1 +M) = L\n2 \u2211 s i \u03b8s\u03b2s + \u2211 s Cs\n+ 2 \u2211 s1<s2 \u03b2s1\u03b2s2 ln [ L sin (\u03b8s2 \u2212 \u03b8s1 2 )] , (29)\nwhere the constant Cs depends on the jump only via \u03b2s, and we assumed \u2211 s \u03b2s = 0.\nLet us first consider the case of adjacent intervals, where both symbols have two FH singularities with s = 0, 1. In particular, for \u03c6A1(\u03b8) the jumps at \u03b80 = 0 and \u03b81 are characterized by \u03b21 = \u2212\u03b20 = \u03b2(\u03bbk), where\n\u03b2(\u03bbk) = 1\n2\u03c0i ln [\u03a6(\u03bbk)] . (30)\nApplying the FH formula (29) and adding the contribution of the second determinant in (20) then gives\nlnZA1,k = ` 2 ln [ (1\u2212 a+ ei\u03bbka)(1\u2212 b+ ei\u03bbkb) ] \u2212 2\u03b22(\u03bbk) ln [L sin(\u03c0`/L)] + 2 C(\u03bbk), (31)\nwhere C(\u03bbk) is a subleading constant. The result for A1\u222a A2 simply follows by substituting ` \u2192 2`. It is easy to see that the extensive term cancels out in the RMI, and after carrying out the sum over k as in (12) and taking the limit L\u2192\u221e one arrives at\nIn = \u03c3n ln `+ const, (32)\nwhere the prefactor reads\n\u03c3n = 1 1\u2212 n 1 2\u03c02\nn\u22121 2\u2211\nk=\u2212n\u221212\nln2 (\n1\u2212 a+ ei\u03bbka 1\u2212 b+ ei\u03bbkb\n) . (33)\nBefore testing the validity of (33), let us first observe some of its properties. First of all, due to the definition of the \u03bbk in (14), the expression is real as it should. Moreover, it is easy to check that (33) is invariant under the simultaneous exchange of a\u2192 1\u2212a and b\u2192 1\u2212b, which follows from the symmetry of the Re\u0301nyi entropy under a particle-hole transformation. This property is necessary to account for the second jump at q \u2192 \u00b1\u03c0 of the actual occupation nq in (6). The actual scaling of the RMI (10) in the NESS can then be obtained by calculating\nSn(\u03c1A) = 1\n1\u2212 n ln det [C n A + (1\u2212 CA)n] , (34)\nusing the matrix elements in (5) for increasing sizes ` of the intervals A1,2. We fixed \u03b2l = 0 and calculated the scaling of the RMI for several values of n by varying the inverse temperature \u03b2r. The fitted values of the logarithmic prefactor are shown in Fig. 1, together with the analytical prediction (33), with an excellent agreement.\nIt is also straightforward to handle the case of disjoint intervals, where the symbol (26) has four jumps, characterized by \u03b21 = \u03b23 = \u03b2(\u03bbk) and \u03b20 = \u03b22 = \u2212\u03b2(\u03bbk). One then has\nlnZ \u2032A1\u222aA2,k = ` ln [ (1\u2212 a+ ei\u03bbka)(1\u2212 b+ ei\u03bbkb) ] \u2212 2\u03b22(\u03bbk) ln [ f2(`)f(2`+ d)f(d)\nf2(`+ d)\n] + 4 C(\u03bbk) , (35)\nwhere we introduced\nf(x) = L sin(\u03c0x/L) . (36)\nThus in the limit L\u2192\u221e the RMI becomes\nIn = \u2212\u03c3n ln \u03b7, (37)\nwhere the parameter \u03b7 is nothing but the cross ratio of the disjoint intervals\n\u03b7 = (2`+ d)d\n(`+ d)2 . (38)\nNote that this is exactly the result conjectured in [62]. The result can be checked against the numerical data obtained in the NESS, by fixing the distance d of the intervals and varying `. The RMI with n = 2 is plotted against \u03b7 in Fig. 2 for \u03b2l = 0 and various \u03b2r, while the lines show the FH result in Eq. (37). The agreement is good, although some finite-size corrections can be seen for small values of d.\n5 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nI2\n\u03b7\nd=2 d=10 d=20 -\u03c32 ln(\u03b7)\nFIG. 2.

We follow the route that has been applied in [37] to construct an integral representation of the sum (33). Let us first note, that the discrete values (14) appearing in the sum are actually related to the zeroes of the polynomial\npn(z) = z n + (1\u2212 z)n =\nn\u22121 2\u220f\nk=\u2212n\u221212\n( 1\u2212 z\nzk\n) . (39)\nIndeed, it easy to see that\nzk = (1\u2212 ei\u03bbk)\u22121, (40)\nand thus the summand of (33) reads ln2 (\n1\u2212 a+ ei\u03bbka 1\u2212 b+ ei\u03bbkb\n) = ln2 ( zk \u2212 a zk \u2212 b ) . (41)\nAnalogously to (30), we can define the function\n\u03b2(z) = 1\n2\u03c0i ln ( z \u2212 a z \u2212 b ) , (42)\nand by the residue theorem we thus have\n\u03c3n = \u2212 2\n1\u2212 n \u222e \u0393 dz 2\u03c0i p\u2032n(z) pn(z) \u03b22(z) , (43)\nwhere the integration contour \u0393 encircles the roots zk. To evaluate the contour integral above, one should note that the function \u03b2(z) has a branch cut\n\u03b2(x+ i0\u00b1) = 1\n2\u03c0i ln ( x\u2212 a b\u2212 x ) \u2213 1 2 (44)\nalong x \u2208 [a, b], while it is analytic outside of that interval. The integration contour must avoid this branch cut, running infinitesimally close to it on both sides, whereas the contour can be closed on a circle of radius R\u2192\u221e, as depicted in Fig. 3. Since \u03b2(z) \u2192 0 on the latter part of the contour, the only contribution to the integral comes from the branch cut. Indeed, using (44), one needs only the term in \u03b22(z) that changes sign when crossing the branch cut. Furthermore, one can rewrite\n1 1\u2212 n p\u2032n(x) pn(x) = s\u2032n(x) (45)\nas the derivative of the Re\u0301nyi entropy density\nsn(x) = 1\n1\u2212 n ln [x n + (1\u2212 x)n] . (46)\nThis yields the integral representation of the prefactor\n\u03c3n = 1\n\u03c02 \u222b b a dx s\u2032n(x) ln ( b\u2212 x x\u2212 a ) . (47)\nThe result is an analytic function of the index n and can thus be continued to arbitrary non-integer values.\nIt is instructive to check how (47) relates to the result in [44], obtained by a direct FH calculation with the NESS correlation matrix (5), using the method of [58]. In fact, by partial integration one obtains\n\u03c3n = 1\n\u03c02 b\u2212 \u222b a+ dx sn(x) b\u2212 a (x\u2212 a)(b\u2212 x)\n+ 1\n\u03c02 [sn(b) + sn(a)] ln b\u2212 a , (48)\nwhich is exactly the expression found in [44] for n = 1. Note that one has to introduce an infinitesimal \u2192 0 to avoid the logarithmic singularity of the integral, which is exactly canceled by the boundary term on the second line\n6 of (48). The prefactor \u03c3 = limn\u21921 \u03c3n can be evaluated in terms of the dilogarithm function Li2 (x) as [44]\n\u03c3 = 1\n\u03c02\n[ aLi2 ( a\u2212 b a ) +(1\u2212 a)Li2 ( b\u2212 a 1\u2212 a ) +bLi2 ( b\u2212 a b ) + (1\u2212 b)Li2 ( a\u2212 b 1\u2212 b )] . (49)\nAnother case we are interested in is the RMI with index \u03b1 = 1/2, where the derivation of a closed form expression is more involved and can be found in appendix B.

            "text": "We now move forward to our main goal of evaluating the logarithmic negativity between two intervals A1 and A2 in the NESS. Throughout this section we will use the\nnotation A = A1 \u222a A2, and \u03c1A = TrB(\u03c1\u221e) with B = A\u0304. The negativity is originally defined via the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix \u03c1A which, however, in general leads to a non-Gaussian state [63]. For freefermion systems one could, instead, define the negativity via the partial time reversal operation [64]. This leads to the Gaussian operators\nO+ = \u03c1 T2 A , O\u2212 = (\u03c1 T2 A ) \u2020 , (52)\nwhere T2 denotes the partial time reversal with respect to A2. They are characterized by their correlation matrices\nC\u00b1 = ( CA1A1 \u00b1iCA1A2 \u00b1iCA2A1 1A2 \u2212 CA2A2 ) , (53)\nwhere we used a block notation and one has (C\u00b1)mn = Tr (O\u00b1c \u2020 mcn). The fermionic logarithmic negativity is then defined via the trace norm as [64]\nE = ln ||\u03c1T2A ||1 = ln Tr \u221a O+O\u2212 , (54)\nand was shown to be a proper entanglement measure [65]. In fact, it also provides a natural upper bound to the standard negativity, as defined via the partial transpose [66, 67].\nTo calculate E , we follow a similar strategy to the one applied for the RMI. Namely, we use the replica trick and define the quantity\nEn = ln Tr (O+O\u2212)n/2 (55)\nfor arbitrary even integer n. If we are able to calculate En analytically, the logarithmic negativity follows from the replica limit\nE = lim n\u21921 En . (56)\nOne thus needs the analytic continuation n \u2192 1 of a sequence En on even integers. Analogously to the RMI in (12), this object can be decoupled into a sum [64]\nEn = 2 Re n\u22121 2\u2211\nk= 12\nln Z\u0303k, (57)\nwhere we defined the twisted partition function\nZ\u0303k = Tr (\u03c1Ae i\u03bbkN\u0302A1 ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk)N\u0302A2 ) . (58)\nHere N\u0302A1 and N\u0302A2 are the particle-number operators of the respective subsystem. Note that both \u03bbk and the reversed phase \u03c0\u2212\u03bbk are located on the upper half plane for k > 0, and take values as in (14) with half-integer k.\nThe partition function Z\u0303k can be computed using trace formulas for the products of Gaussian operators as\nZ\u0303k = det [ 1A \u2212 CA + ei\u03bbk1 A1 ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk)1 A2CA ] , (59)\n7 where 1A1 , 1A2 and 1A are the identity matrices on the respective subsystem. Clearly, due to the appearance of the reversed phase, (59) is not the determinant of a Toeplitz matrix. We will show, however, that after exchanging CA \u2192 C \u2032A, a dual Toeplitz matrix can again be constructed, which is similar to the overlap matrix. To this end, we first note that for a correlation matrix C0A of a Fermi sea state as in (18), one has the identity\nTr (DC0A) n = Tr M\u0303n , (60)\nwhere D = diag(dj) is an arbitrary diagonal matrix and the modified overlap matrix is defined as\nM\u0303pq = \u2211 j\u2208A dj \u03d5 \u2217 p(j)\u03d5q(j) . (61)\nIn other words, since (60) is satisfied for arbitrary n, the matrices DC0A and M\u0303 have the same eigenvalues. The proof of the identity simply follows by writing out the left hand side of (60) as\u2211 j1,...,jn\u2208A \u2211 q1,...,qn\u22640 dj1\u03d5 \u2217 q1(j1)\u03d5q1(j2) . . . djn\u03d5 \u2217 qn(jn)\u03d5qn(j1) (62) and reordering the sums.\nOne can now replace CA \u2192 C \u2032A as defined in (17) and insert it into (59), which leads to\nZ\u0303k = det [ 1A +DC 0 A ] det [E] , (63)\nwhere the matrices are given by\nD = E\u22121(a\u2212 b)(ei\u03bbk1 A1 ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk)1 A2 \u2212 1A) , (64) E = (1\u2212 b)1A + b ei\u03bbk1 A1 ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk)1 A2 . (65)\nThe matrix D is thus diagonal, with matrix elements given by\ndj =  (a\u2212b)(ei\u03bbk\u22121) 1+b(ei\u03bbk\u22121) j \u2208 A1\n(a\u2212b)(ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk)\u22121) 1+b(ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk)\u22121) j \u2208 A2\n. (66)\nFinally, we can apply (60) and replace DC0A by M\u0303 in the first determinant of (63). In the limit L \u2192 \u221e, this becomes a Toeplitz determinant of the matrix\n(1 + M\u0303)pq = \u222b 2\u03c0 0 \u03c6\u0303A(\u03b8)e \u2212i(p\u2212q)\u03b8d\u03b8 , (67)\nwith the Fisher-Hartwig symbol\n\u03c6\u0303A(\u03b8) =  \u03a6(\u03bbk) 0 < \u03b8 < \u03b81 \u03a6(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bbk) \u03b82 < \u03b8 < \u03b83 1 otherwise , (68)\nwhere \u03a6(\u03bb) is given in (24), while the jump locations \u03b81 and \u03b82, \u03b83 are defined in (25) and (27), respectively.\nWe are now ready to evaluate the determinant using the FH theorem (29). Let us first consider the case of adjacent intervals where \u03b82 = \u03b81 and \u03b83 = 2\u03b81. One has thus three FH singularities described by the functions\n\u03b20(\u03bbk) = \u2212 1\n2\u03c0i ln[\u03a6(\u03bbk)] ,\n\u03b21(\u03bbk) = 1\n2\u03c0i ln\n[ \u03a6(\u03bbk)\n\u03a6(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bbk)\n] ,\n\u03b22(\u03bbk) = 1\n2\u03c0i ln[\u03a6(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bbk)] .\n(69)\nIn turn, the Re\u0301nyi negativity (57) is given by\nEn = \u03b1\u0303n `+ \u03c3\u0303n ln `+ const, (70)\nwhere the prefactor of the logarithmic contribution is\n\u03c3\u0303n = 4 Re\nn\u22121 2\u2211\nk= 12\n\u2211 s1<s2 \u03b2s1(\u03bbk)\u03b2s2(\u03bbk) . (71)\nNote that, in general, one has an extensive term which receives contributions also from the second determinant in (63), and its prefactor can be evaluated as\n\u03b1\u0303n = 2 Re\nn\u22121 2\u2211\nk= 12\nln [ (1\u2212 a+ ei\u03bbka)(1\u2212 b+ ei\u03bbkb) ] . (72)\nHere we used the fact that \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bbk has the same set of allowed values as \u03bbk. Furthermore, taking twice the real part is equivalent to including the negative k values in the sum. Using the factorization in (39), one has then\n\u03b1\u0303n = ln [a n + (1\u2212 a)n] + ln [bn + (1\u2212 b)n] , (73)\nand hence the extensive prefactor vanishes in the limit n\u2192 1. On the other hand, the logarithmic prefactor can be obtained using (69) as\n\u03c3\u0303n = 1\n\u03c02 Re\nn\u22121 2\u2211\nk= 12\n{ 2 ln2[\u03a6(\u03bbk)]\u2212 ln[\u03a6(\u03bbk)] ln[\u03a6(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bbk)] } .\n(74) Finally, let us consider the case of disjoint intervals. The symbol (68) has then four FH singularities, characterized by\n\u03b21(\u03bbk) = \u2212\u03b20(\u03bbk) = 1\n2\u03c0i ln[\u03a6(\u03bbk)] ,\n\u03b23(\u03bbk) = \u2212\u03b22(\u03bbk) = 1\n2\u03c0i ln[\u03a6(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bbk)] .\n(75)\nSimilarly to (35), the different pairings of the \u03b2s(\u03bbk) are now multiplied by different logarithmic factors, and the prefactor (74) splits into two parts. In particular, the first sum including the ln2[\u03a6(\u03bbk)] is multiplied by ln `, whereas the second mixed term is multiplied by \u2212 ln \u03b7, with the cross-ratio defined in (38).\n8"

            "text": "The final step to obtain the entanglement negativity is to carry out the analytic continuation (56). This can be performed in a very similar fashion as for the Re\u0301nyi mutual information in Sec. III A. Namely, we shall find an integral representation of the sum (74), which is analytic in n and thus the limit n \u2192 1 can be carried out. First of all note that, using (24), the first part of the sum is actually related to the RMI prefactor (33) as\n2\n\u03c02 Re\nn\u22121 2\u2211\nk= 12\nln2[\u03a6(\u03bbk)] = 2(1\u2212 n)\u03c3n , (76)\nand thus will vanish in the limit n \u2192 1. We shall thus focus only on the mixed term in (74), where both \u03bbk and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bbk appear.\nThe main idea that was already applied in [37] is to consider the complex roots z\u0303k of the polynomial\np\u0303n(z) = z n/2 + (1\u2212 z)n/2 =\nn\u22121 2\u220f\nk= 12\n( 1\u2212 z\nz\u0303k\n) , (77)\nwhich can be expressed via the positive phases \u03bbk as\nz\u0303\u22121k = 1 + e \u22122i\u03bbk , k =\n1 2 , . . . , n\u2212 1 2 . (78)\nIn the integral representation the roots should appear as poles. It should be noted, however, that there is a one-toone correspondence between the phases \u03bbk and the roots z\u0303k only for n/2 even. Indeed, for n/2 odd the phase \u03bbk = \u03c0/2 appears, which corresponds to z\u0303 \u22121 k = 0, i.e. p\u0303n(z) actually has only n/2\u2212 1 roots. The contribution of the missing pole thus has to be added in this case. For the moment we shall assume n/2 to be even, and comment on the other case later on.\nInverting the relation (78) requires some care. In order to have all the phases on the upper half plane, one needs\nei\u03bbk = i\n\u221a z\u0303k\nz\u0303k \u2212 1 , ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk) = i \u221a z\u0303k \u2212 1 z\u0303k . (79)\nThe integral representation of the sum thus reads\n1\n\u03c02 Re \u222b \u0393\u0303 dz 2\u03c0i p\u0303\u2032n(z) p\u0303n(z) ln[\u03a6(z)] ln[\u03a6\u0304(z)] , (80)\nwhere the arguments are given by\n\u03a6(z) = 1\u2212 a+ i\n\u221a z z\u22121a\n1\u2212 b+ i \u221a\nz z\u22121b\n, (81)\n\u03a6\u0304(z) = 1\u2212 b+ i\n\u221a z\u22121 z b\n1\u2212 a+ i \u221a\nz\u22121 z a\n. (82)\nNote that, apart from the poles at z\u0303k, the integrand has a branch cut along [0, 1] due to the square root in the\nargument of the logarithms. Thus the contour \u0393\u0303 has to be chosen in a similar fashion to Fig. 3, such that it goes around the branch cut and encircles all the poles, with its outer radius taken to be very large.\nThe first contribution to the contour integral comes from the path running along the branch cut. Indeed, for z = x+ i0\u00b1 and x \u2208 [0, 1] one has\ni\n\u221a z z \u2212 1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u221a x 1\u2212 x , i \u221a z \u2212 1 z \u2192 \u2213 \u221a 1\u2212 x x , (83)\nand the integral reads\n1\n\u03c02 Im \u222b 1 0 dx \u03c0 p\u0303\u2032n(x) p\u0303n(x) ln[\u03a6(x)] ln[\u03a6\u0304(x)] , (84)\nwhere\n\u03a6(x) = 1\u2212 a+\n\u221a x\n1\u2212xa 1\u2212 b+ \u221a\nx 1\u2212xb\n, (85)\n\u03a6\u0304(x) = 1\u2212 b\u2212\n\u221a 1\u2212x x b\n1\u2212 a\u2212 \u221a\n1\u2212x x a\n. (86)\nNote that a factor two appears since the contributions are equal on both sides of the branch cut, and by dropping the factor i one now needs the imaginary part of the integral. Since \u03a6(x) > 0 for x \u2208 [0, 1], an imaginary part can only appear when \u03a6\u0304(x) < 0. This is the case on the interval x \u2208 [a\u0303, b\u0303] where\na\u0303 = a2 a2 + (1\u2212 a)2 , b\u0303 = b2 b2 + (1\u2212 b)2 . (87)\nOne has then Im ln[\u03a6\u0304(x)] = \u03c0 and one arrives at\n1\n\u03c02 \u222b b\u0303 a\u0303 dx p\u0303\u2032n(x) p\u0303n(x) ln[\u03a6(x)] . (88)\nWe also need the contribution over the large circle of the contour \u0393\u0303, parametrized as z = Rei\u03d5 with R \u2192 \u221e, which turns out to be nonvanishing. Indeed, the squareroots in \u03a6(z) and \u03a6\u0304(z) converge to one and thus the logarithms in the integrand yield a constant. On the other hand on has\nlim R\u2192\u221e\np\u0303\u2032n(z) p\u0303n(z) =\n{ n 2 z \u22121 n/2 even\n(n2 \u2212 1) z\u22121 n/2 odd , (89)\nand thus the asymptotics depends on the parity of n/2. In fact, this is simply due to the missing root for n/2 odd, where the contribution from \u03bbk = \u03c0/2 has to be added to the contour integral (80). Adding the two pieces removes the parity dependence, and with dz/z = id\u03d5 one obtains the contribution on the circle\n\u2212 n 2\u03c02\nRe ln2 (\n1\u2212 a+ a i 1\u2212 b+ b i\n) , (90)\n9 which is valid for arbitrary n. Collecting all the contributions, the integral representation of the sum (74) reads\n\u03c3\u0303n = 1\n\u03c02 \u222b b\u0303 a\u0303 dx p\u0303\u2032n(x) p\u0303n(x) ln\n1\u2212 a+ a \u221a x 1\u2212x\n1\u2212 b+ b \u221a\nx 1\u2212x  \u2212 n\n2\u03c02 Re ln2 ( 1\u2212 a+ a i 1\u2212 b+ b i ) + 2(1\u2212 n)\u03c3n . (91)\nThe result can now be analytically continued to n \u2192 1. In fact, as shown in Appendix B, the integral for \u03c3\u0303 = limn\u21921 \u03c3\u0303n can be evaluated in a closed form. After a lengthy calculation one obtains\n\u03c3\u0303 = 1\n\u03c02 Re\n[ 1 2 ln2 ( 1 + i x\u0303a 1 + i x\u0303b ) +Li2 ( 1 + i x\u0303b 1\u2212 i x\u0303\u22121a ) + Li2 ( 1 + i x\u0303a 1\u2212 i x\u0303\u22121b\n) \u2212Li2 ( 1 + i x\u0303a 1\u2212 i x\u0303\u22121a ) \u2212 Li2 ( 1 + i x\u0303b 1\u2212 i x\u0303\u22121b )] , (92)\nwhere the parameters are defined as\nx\u0303a = 1\u2212 2a , x\u0303b = 1\u2212 2b .

In fact, previous results on quantum quenches in free-fermion systems have indicated, that the two quantities are related as E = 12I1/2 [33, 35]. In the present case, however, one can see that an analogous relation between the prefactors \u03c3\u0303 and 12\u03c31/2 does not hold. Despite the very similar structure of their analytical expressions in (50) and (92), the first obvious difference is in their respective variables (51) and (93). It is instructive to rewrite these variables in terms of the inverse temperatures. Substituting (9) one obtains\nxa = \u2212 tanh ( \u03b2r 4 ) , x\u0303a = \u2212 tanh ( \u03b2r 2 ) , (98)\nand analogously for xb and x\u0303b by exchanging \u03b2r \u2192 \u03b2l. Interestingly, there is a simple factor two difference, which might suggest that the two prefactors become comparable only after an additional rescaling of the temperatures. This is indeed how the pairs \u03b2l and \u03b2r were chosen in Figs. 4 and 5, resulting in a qualitatively similar behaviour of the prefactors. However, having a closer look at the vertical scale, one immediately sees that the values of 12\u03c31/2 are much larger than those of \u03c3\u0303. The reason of this mismatch is that the arguments of the dilogarithm functions (50) and (92) are still not the same in terms of their natural variables.\nIn order to compare the prefactors directly, we shall fix xb = x\u0303b = \u22121 (setting the left reservoir to zero temperature \u03b2l \u2192 \u221e), and plot them against the variable x\u0303a, as shown in Fig. 7. In the regime x\u0303a < 0 allowed for positive temperatures, 12\u03c31/2 is always larger than \u03c3\u0303, as observed already in Figs. 4 and 5. We have, however, also plotted the prefactors for x\u0303a > 0, corresponding to negative temperatures according to (98). This should be understood as an additional particle-hole transformation in the right bath, allowing for values 0 < a < 1/2 in (15). Interestingly, the two curves cross each other at x\u0303a \u2248 0.577, and \u03c3\u0303 becomes larger than 12\u03c31/2. The prefactors coincide again in the limit x\u0303a = 1, where the occupation (15) with a = 0 and b = 1 is just a shifted Fermi sea. Hence, in this limit one reproduces the ground-state result \u03c3\u0303 = 12\u03c31/2 = 1 4 , which follows also from CFT calculations [9, 10]."

In particular, we are interested in E(t) evaluated in the timeevolved state (3). Since the density matrix \u03c1t is Gaussian at any time t, the calculation of the negativity can easily be generalized. In fact, one only needs the time-evolved correlation matrix\nC(t) = U\u2020C(0)U, (99)\nwhere the propagator has matrix elements Umn = in\u2212mJn\u2212m(t) given by the Bessel functions. The initial correlation matrix C(0) = Cl(0) \u2295 Cr(0) is a direct sum of thermal correlation matrices of the half-chains, corresponding to the factorized initial state (2). Note that, although in (99) one needs the product of infinite matrices, the terms that contribute are heavily restricted by the light-cone behaviour of the propagator.\nWith the expression (99) at hand, one can simply define the time-dependent matrices G\u00b1(t) and G\u00d7(t) and use the corresponding formula (94) to evaluate E(t). We are interested in the entanglement negativity of two intervals placed symmetrically around the junction. The results are shown on Fig. 8 for some fixed initial temperatures, both for adjacent as well as disjoint intervals. Although the lack of translational invariance prevents us from using FH techniques, we expect that the result is similar to the one found for the mutual information [44]. Namely for adjacent intervals one has a logarithmic growth\nE(t) = \u03c3\u0303 ln t+ const (100)\nfor short times t < `, with the exact same prefactor that governs the system-size scaling in the NESS. On the other hand, for times t > ` after the front has crossed the boundaries of the intervals, one expects a relaxation towards the NESS value.\nThis is indeed what we observe on the left of Fig. 8, where (100) is shown by the red solid line, with the constant parameter determined by fitting. The NESS values are indicated by the horizontal lines for ` = 20, 40, and the data shows a clear convergence towards them. The disjoint case on the right of Fig. 8 shows qualitatively similar features, with a delayed increase and decrease of E(t) at times t = d/2 and t = `+d/2, with d/2 being the distance from the junction. The precise description of E(t) between these times is, however, beyond our reach.\n11"

            "heading": "V. DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We have studied the scaling of entanglement in a current-carrying NESS of free fermions. Due to the Gaussianity of the state, both the RMI as well as the Re\u0301nyi generalization of the entanglement negativity can be obtained via determinants involving the reduced correlation matrix. Moreover, the analytic continuation in the Re\u0301nyi index can be worked out explicitly. One finds a logarithmic scaling for both quantities, which is a consequence of the jump singularity in the NESS occupation function, and the prefactors can be determined by FH techniques. In particular, we find different prefactors for the negativity as well as for the RMI with index \u03b1 = 1/2.\nTo derive our analytical result we assumed that the only important details of the otherwise continuous occupation function are the values at the two jump locations. In our particular case, the second jump at momentum q = \u03c0 is related to that at q = 0 by a particle-hole symmetry. This is equivalent to the change of variables xa,b \u2192 \u2212xa,b and x\u0303a,b \u2192 \u2212x\u0303a,b, which is a trivial symmetry of the prefactors (50) and (92). A more general situation would be to consider initial states with different chemical potentials in the two reservoirs, which would brake the particle-hole symmetry. We conjecture that the corresponding negativity prefactor would be a sum of the prefactors \u03c3\u0303/2 evaluated at the corresponding jump parameters, and similarly for the RMI.\nAnother natural extension of the result would be to consider the NESS of an XY chain, which is described by block-Toeplitz matrices with similar jump singularities [53, 69]. The result for the RMI can then be obtained [47] by using a generalized FH conjecture proposed in [70]. It would be interesting to extend these techniques to the calculation of the negativity. Note, however, that for spin models one has the additional difficulty, that the partial transpose produces a non-Gaussian state [63, 71, 72], and\nthe negativities in the spin and fermion representations are not equivalent. Nevertheless, the quench examples studied so far indicate that these two representations actually produce very similar results [34, 73], at least to leading order. Whether this holds true for the mixed NESS at hand remains an open question.\nIn a broader context one might wonder about the origin of the discrepancy between the \u03b1 = 1/2 RMI and the negativity. In the field theory context, this was found to occur only in irrational CFTs [42] and was associated to a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture [43]. This is clearly not the case here, as the free-fermion chain has perfectly well defined quasiparticles. However, there is actually no proper CFT description of the NESS studied here, as the logarithmic scaling of the negativity and RMI is clearly related to the nonvanishing dispersion at q \u2192 0 and is thus a lattice effect. On the other hand, discrepancies between E and 12I1/2 have also been observed in the case of dissipative free-fermion dynamics [38, 39]. The property this scenario has in common with ours is the global state being mixed. Whether in such cases the RMI is still a good measure of correlations and provides some relevant information about the quantum state remains to be further explored."

            "heading": "Appendix A: Determinant formulas",
            "text": "Here we provide determinant formulas that are necessary for the derivation of Eqs. (12) and (57) for the Re\u0301nyi entropy and negativity, respectively. Let us consider a particle-conserving fermionic Gaussian state \u03c1 characterized by its correlation matrix Cmn = Tr (\u03c1 c \u2020 mcn). The Re\u0301nyi entropy of a subsystem A is then given by\nSn(\u03c1A) = 1\n1\u2212 n ln det [C n A + (1 \u2212 CA)n] , (A1)\nwhere CA is the reduced correlation matrix and 1 \u2261 1A. Using the factorization of the polynomial (39), the determinant in (A1) can be rewritten as a product\ndet [CnA + (1 \u2212 CA)n] = n\u22121 2\u220f\nk=\u2212n\u221212\ndet [ 1 \u2212 z\u22121k CA ] ,\n(A2) where zk are the roots given in (40). Taking the logarithm and substituting for zk, one immediately obtains the required formula (12).\nThe calculation of the negativity is somewhat more complicated. In order to evaluate the trace in (55), it is useful to introduce the auxiliary density matrix [67]\n\u03c1\u00d7 = O+O\u2212\nTr (O+O\u2212) . (A3)\nUsing multiplication rules for Gaussian states, the corresponding correlation matrix is given by C\u00d7 = (1 +G\u00d7)/2, where G\u00d7 was defined in (95). The trace of the n/2-th power can then be written as\nTr (\u03c1\u00d7) n 2 = det\n[( 1 +G\u00d7\n2\n)n 2\n+\n( 1 \u2212G\u00d7\n2\n)n 2 ] . (A4)\nThe normalization factor in (A3) is given by\nTr (O+O\u2212) = det\n[ 1 +G+G\u2212\n2\n] , (A5)\nwhere G\u00b1 = 2C\u00b1 \u2212 1 . One then has\nEn = ln Tr (\u03c1\u00d7) n 2 +\nn 2 ln Tr (O+O\u2212) . (A6)\nNote that, since (A4) is valid for arbitrary (non-integer) powers, one can simply substitute n \u2192 1 which yields the formula (94) in the main text.\nThe next step is to apply the factorization of the determinant in (A4). Using (77) one can rewrite\nTr (\u03c1\u00d7) n 2 =\nn\u22121 2\u220f\nk= 12\ndet [ 1 \u2212 z\u0303\u22121k 1 \u2212G\u00d7 2 ] , (A7)\nwhere the roots z\u0303k are defined in (78). Inserting the expression (95) of G\u00d7 and taking the logarithm one obtains\nln Tr (\u03c1\u00d7) n 2 =\nn\u22121 2\u2211\nk= 12\n{ \u2212 ln det [ 1 +G+G\u2212\n2\n]\n+ ln det\n[ 1 +G+G\u2212\n2 \u2212 z\u0303\n\u22121 k 4 (1 \u2212G+)(1 \u2212G\u2212)\n]} .\n(A8)\nNotice that the first term in the above sum exactly cancels with the second term in (A6). One can now apply a similarity transformation to simplify the remaining determinant. Indeed, one has G\u00b1 = T\u00b1GAT\u00b1, where GA = 2CA \u2212 1 and we introduced the matrices\nT\u00b1 = 1A1 \u2295 (\u00b1i)1A2 , R = 1A1 \u2295 (\u22121)1A2 . (A9)\nNote that T\u00b1 and R are diagonal matrices satisfying T\u2212 = (T+) \u22121 and (T\u00b1) 2 = R, as well as R2 = 1 . Using these properties, one arrives at\nEn = n\u22121 2\u2211\nk= 12\nln det\n[ 1 +G2A\n2 \u2212 z\u0303\u22121k\n( R\u2212GA\n2\n)2] . (A10)\nThe final step is to factorize the matrix in the above determinant. Using the expression of the roots (78), one can check by simple matrix algebra that the following identity holds [37]\n1 +G2A 2 \u2212 z\u0303\u22121k ( R\u2212GA 2 )2 = D+k \u039bkD \u2212 k , (A11)\nwhere \u039bk = e i(\u03c0\u22122\u03bbk)1 A1 and\nD+k = 1 + CA(e i\u03bbk1 A1 ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk)1 A2 \u2212 1 ) , (A12) D\u2212k = 1 + (e \u2212i(\u03c0\u2212\u03bbk)1 A1 e\u2212i\u03bbk1 A2 \u2212 1 )CA . (A13)\nThe determinant in (A10) thus splits into three parts. First we notice that for any even n one has\nn\u22121 2\u220f\nk= 12\ndet \u039bk = 1 , (A14)\nwhich follows from the half-integer values of k. Furthermore, detD+k is exactly the determinant that appears in (59). Finally, let us observe that the phases appearing in D\u2212k are both located on the lower half plane. In fact, one can write\ndetD\u2212k = (detD + n/2\u2212k) \u2217 . (A15)\nPutting everything together, one arrives at the formula (57) of the main text.\n13"

            "heading": "Appendix B: Calculation of \u03c31/2 and \u03c3\u0303",
            "text": "In this appendix we calculate the integrals that appear in the prefactors (47) of the Re\u0301nyi mutual information as well as (91) of the logarithmic negativity. First we focus on \u03c31/2 where one has the following integral\u222b b\na\ndx s\u20321/2(x) ln ( b\u2212 x x\u2212 a ) . (B1)\nLet us introduce a new variable via\ne\u03b5 = \u221a 1\u2212 x x , (B2)\nand define the corresponding boundary values accordingly\ne\u03b5a = \u221a 1\u2212 a a , e\u03b5b = \u221a 1\u2212 b b . (B3)\nThen one has\ns\u20321/2(x) = 2 tanh(\u03b5/2) cosh(\u03b5) , (B4)\nwhile the integration measure transforms as\ndx = \u22121 2\nd\u03b5\ncosh2(\u03b5) , (B5)\nsuch that the integral can be rewritten as\n\u03b5a\u2212\u03b4\u222b \u03b5b+\u03b4 d\u03b5 tanh(\u03b5/2) cosh(\u03b5) ln [ sinh(\u03b5\u2212 \u03b5b) cosh \u03b5a sinh(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5) cosh \u03b5b ] . (B6)\nNote that we introduced an infinitesimal \u03b4 \u2192 0 to regularize the integrand, which has logarithmic singularities around the boundaries. One can now perform a partial integration using\nd d\u03b5 ln [ 1 + tanh2(\u03b5/2) ] = tanh(\u03b5/2) cosh(\u03b5) . (B7)\nThe boundary contribution is then\nB1 = ln [ 1 + tanh2(\u03b5a/2) ] ln\n[ sinh(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5b) cosh \u03b5a\n\u03b4 cosh \u03b5b ] + ln [ 1 + tanh2(\u03b5b/2) ] ln [ sinh(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5b) cosh \u03b5b\n\u03b4 cosh \u03b5a\n] ,\n(B8)\nand the remaining integral reads \u2212 \u03b5a\u2212\u03b4\u222b \u03b5b+\u03b4 d\u03b5 ln [ 1 + tanh2(\u03b5/2) ] [coth(\u03b5\u2212 \u03b5b) + coth(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5)] .\n(B9)\nWe can rewrite\ncoth(\u03b5\u2212 \u03b5b) = 1\n2\n[ tanh (\u03b5\u2212 \u03b5b 2 ) + coth (\u03b5\u2212 \u03b5b 2 )] ,\n(B10) and similarly for coth(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5). This suggests another change of variables\nx = tanh (\u03b5\n2\n) , (B11)\nand the boundary values are given by xa = tanh (\u03b5a\n2\n) =\n\u221a 1\u2212 a\u2212\u221aa\u221a 1\u2212 a+\u221aa , (B12)\nxb = tanh (\u03b5b\n2\n) = \u221a 1\u2212 b\u2212 \u221a b\u221a\n1\u2212 b+ \u221a b . (B13)\nUsing trigonometric identities, one can rewrite the terms in the integrand of (B9) in the new variables as follows\ntanh (\u03b5\u2212 \u03b5b\n2\n) + tanh (\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5 2 ) = (xa \u2212 xb)(1\u2212 x2) (1\u2212 xxa)(1\u2212 xxb) ,\ncoth (\u03b5\u2212 \u03b5b\n2\n) + coth (\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5 2 ) = (xa \u2212 xb)(1\u2212 x2) (x\u2212 xb)(xa \u2212 x) .\n(B14)\nNoting that\ndx = d\u03b5\n2 cosh2 \u03b52 =\nd\u03b5\n2 (1\u2212 x2) , (B15)\nthe integral in the new variable thus reads\n\u2212 xa\u2212\u03b4\u2032a\u222b xb+\u03b4\u2032b dx [ xa \u2212 xb (1\u2212 xxa)(1\u2212 xxb)\n+ xa \u2212 xb\n(x\u2212 xb)(xa \u2212 x)\n] ln(1 + x2) . (B16)\nIt is important to observe that the infinitesimals \u03b4\u2032a and \u03b4\u2032b actually depend on xa and xb. Indeed, one has\nxa \u2212 \u03b4\u2032a = tanh (\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b4\n2\n) \u2248 xa \u2212 \u03b4\n2 (1\u2212 x2a) ,\nxb + \u03b4 \u2032 b = tanh (\u03b5b + \u03b4 2 ) \u2248 xb + \u03b4 2 (1\u2212 x2b) . (B17)\nNow we perform another partial integration using\nd\ndx ln ( 1\u2212 xxb 1\u2212 xxa ) = xa \u2212 xb (1\u2212 xxa)(1\u2212 xxb) ,\nd\ndx ln ( x\u2212 xb xa \u2212 x ) = xa \u2212 xb (x\u2212 xb)(xa \u2212 x) . (B18)\nUsing (B17), the boundary contribution reads B2 =\u2212 ln(1 + x2a) ln [\n2(1\u2212 xaxb)(xa \u2212 xb) \u03b4(1\u2212 x2a)2 ] \u2212 ln(1 + x2b) ln [ 2(1\u2212 xaxb)(xa \u2212 xb) \u03b4(1\u2212 x2b)2 ] , (B19)\n14\nand we are left with the integral\u222b xa xb dx 2x 1 + x2 [ ln ( 1\u2212 xxb 1\u2212 xxa ) + ln ( x\u2212 xb xa \u2212 x )] . (B20)\nNote that the two boundary terms (B8) and (B19) can be collected by rewriting\nsinh(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5b) cosh \u03b5a cosh \u03b5b = 2(1\u2212 xaxb)(xa \u2212 xb) (1\u2212 x2a)2 1 + x2a 1 + x2b ,\n(B21) and similarly for the other term, such that the overall contribution reads\nB1 +B2 = ln 2 ( 1 + x2a 1 + x2b ) . (B22)\nThe integral (B20) can be further simplified by noting that\n2x\n1 + x2 =\ni 1 + ix \u2212 i 1\u2212 ix = 2 Re ( i 1 + ix ) . (B23)\nThe remaining integrals can be explicitly evaluated in terms of the dilogarithm function as\u222b xa\nxb\ndx i\n1 + i x ln ( 1\u2212 xxb 1\u2212 xxa ) =\n\u2212 ln (\n1 + i xa 1 + i xb\n) ln ( 1\u2212 i xa 1\u2212 i xb ) +Li2 ( 1 + i xa 1 + i x\u22121a ) + Li2 ( 1 + i xb 1 + i x\u22121b\n) \u2212Li2 ( 1 + i xb 1 + i x\u22121a ) \u2212 Li2 ( 1 + i xa 1 + i x\u22121b ) , (B24)\nwhile the second integral yields\u222b xa xb dx i 1 + i x ln ( x\u2212 xb xa \u2212 x ) = \u22121 2 ln2 ( 1 + i xa 1 + i xb ) . (B25) Finally, collecting the logarithms in Eqs. (B22), (B24) and (B25), with the definition z = 1+i xa1+i xb , one has\nln2(z z\u2217)\u2212 Re ln2(z)\u2212 2 ln(z) ln(z\u2217) = Re ln2(z) (B26)\nand one thus arrives at the final result (50) reported in the main text.\nThe calculation of the negativity prefactor \u03c3\u0303 follows a very similar line. The integral that appears in (91) reads\n\u222b b\u0303 a\u0303 dx p\u0303\u20321(x) p\u03031(x) ln\n1\u2212 a+ a \u221a x 1\u2212x\n1\u2212 b+ b \u221a\nx 1\u2212x  . (B27) We first observe that\np\u0303\u20321(x) p\u03031(x) = 1 2 s\u20321/2(x) . (B28)\nLet us change again variables as in (B2). Note that the integration boundaries are now different and we define\ne\u03b5\u0303a = \u221a 1\u2212 a\u0303 a\u0303 = 1\u2212 a a , e\u03b5\u0303b = \u221a 1\u2212 b\u0303 b\u0303 = 1\u2212 b b .\n(B29) We then have\n1\n2 \u222b \u03b5\u0303a \u03b5\u0303b d\u03b5 tanh( \u03b52 ) cosh(\u03b5) ln [ cosh( \u03b5\u0303b2 ) cosh( \u03b5+\u03b5\u0303a 2 ) cosh( \u03b5\u0303a2 ) cosh( \u03b5+\u03b5\u0303b 2 ) ] . (B30)\nWe now integrate by parts, with the contribution from the integral boundaries given by\nB\u03031 = 1\n2 ln\n[ 1 + tanh2 ( \u03b5\u0303a 2 )] ln [ 1 + tanh2( \u03b5\u0303a2 )\n1 + tanh( \u03b5\u0303a2 ) tanh( \u03b5\u0303b 2 )\n]\n+ 1\n2 ln\n[ 1 + tanh2 ( \u03b5\u0303b 2 )] ln [ 1 + tanh2( \u03b5\u0303b2 )\n1 + tanh( \u03b5\u0303a2 ) tanh( \u03b5\u0303b 2 ) ] (B31)\nwhereas the remaining integral to be evaluated reads\n\u2212 1 2 \u222b \u03b5\u0303a \u03b5\u0303b d\u03b5 ln [ 1 + tanh2(\u03b5/2) ] \u00d7 1\n2\n[ tanh (\u03b5+ \u03b5\u0303a 2 ) \u2212 tanh (\u03b5+ \u03b5\u0303b 2 )] . (B32)\nIntroducing now the variable change (B11), the integral transforms into\n\u22121 2 \u222b x\u0303a x\u0303b dx 1\u2212 x2 ln ( 1 + x2 )( x+ x\u0303a 1 + x x\u0303a \u2212 x+ x\u0303b 1 + x x\u0303b ) ,\n(B33) where we have defined\nx\u0303a = tanh ( \u03b5\u0303a\n2\n) = 1\u2212 2a ,\nx\u0303b = tanh ( \u03b5\u0303b\n2\n) = 1\u2212 2b . (B34)\nThe integrand of (B33) can be further simplified as\n\u22121 2 \u222b x\u0303a x\u0303b dx ln ( 1 + x2 ) x\u0303a \u2212 x\u0303b (1 + x x\u0303a)(1 + x x\u0303b) . (B35)\nNow we perform another partial integration using\nd\ndx ln ( 1 + x x\u0303a 1 + x x\u0303b ) = x\u0303a \u2212 x\u0303b (1 + x x\u0303a)(1 + x x\u0303b) . (B36)\nThe boundary contribution then reads\nB\u03032 = \u2212 1\n2 ln(1 + x\u03032a) ln\n( 1 + x\u03032a\n1 + x\u0303a x\u0303b ) \u22121\n2 ln(1 + x\u03032b) ln\n( 1 + x\u03032b\n1 + x\u0303a x\u0303b\n) , (B37)\n15\nthus using the definition (B34), it exactly cancels the\nprevious boundary contribution in (B31), B\u03031 + B\u03032 = 0. The remaining integral to be evaluated is then\n\u222b x\u0303a x\u0303b dx x 1 + x2 ln ( 1 + x x\u0303a 1 + x x\u0303b ) . (B38)\nWe use again (B23), such that (B38) can be evaluated\nvia the complex valued integral\u222b x\u0303a x\u0303b dx i 1 + ix ln ( 1 + x x\u0303a 1 + x x\u0303b ) = ln2 ( 1 + i x\u0303a 1 + i x\u0303b ) + Li2 ( i x\u0303a\n1 + i x\u0303b 1 + i x\u0303a\n) + Li2 ( i x\u0303b\n1 + i x\u0303a 1 + i x\u0303b ) \u2212 Li2 (i x\u0303a)\u2212 Li2 (i x\u0303b) (B39)\nFinally, using\n1\u2212 a+ a i 1\u2212 b+ b i = 1\u2212 i x\u0303a 1\u2212 i x\u0303b\n(B40)\nin the second piece of (91), we arrive at the result (92) in the main text.\n[1] L.
