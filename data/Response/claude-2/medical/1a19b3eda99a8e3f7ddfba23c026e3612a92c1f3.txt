 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct more comprehensive autonomic testing in children with PWS using a standardized battery of tests to fully characterize ANS dysfunction. This could include tests of sympathetic function like muscle sympathetic nerve activity, thermoregulatory sweat testing, and skin conductance. 

2. Examine the molecular genetic causes of altered ANS function in PWS, such as defects in specific genes like necdin, MAGEL2, and prohormone convertase PC1. This could elucidate the mechanisms underlying ANS dysregulation.

3. Longitudinal studies tracking ANS function in children with PWS over time to determine if deficits are progressive and related to clinical complications. This could identify points for early intervention.

4. Evaluate interventions like exercise, vagus nerve stimulation, or medications aimed at improving ANS regulation in PWS and their effects on hyperphagia, obesity, and other features.

5. Further study the neural circuits involved in appetite, satiety and reward in PWS using advanced neuroimaging techniques. This could provide insights into the distinct neural underpinnings of hyperphagia in PWS versus simple obesity.
