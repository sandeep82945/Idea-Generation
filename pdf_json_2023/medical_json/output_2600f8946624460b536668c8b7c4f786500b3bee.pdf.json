    "abstractText": "Microbial 1(2)-dehydrogenation of 3-ketosteroids is an important basis for the production of many steroid pharmaceuticals and synthons. When using the wild-type strains for whole cell catalysis, the undesirable reduction of the 20-carbonyl group, or 1(2)-hydrogenation, was observed. In this work, the recombinant strains of Mycolicibacterium neoaurum and Mycolicibacterium smegmatis were constructed with blocked endogenous activity of 3-ketosteroid-9\u03b1-hydroxylase, 3-ketosteroid1(2)-dehydrogenase (3-KSD), and expressing 3-KSD encoded by the gene KR76_27125 (kstD2NS) from Nocardioides simplex VKM Ac-2033D. The in vivo activity of the obtained recombinant strains against phytosterol, 6\u03b1-methyl-hydrocortisone, and hydrocortisone was studied. When using M. smegmatis as the host strain, the 1(2)-dehydrogenation activity of the constructed recombinant cells towards hydrocortisone was noticeably higher compared to those on the platform of M. neoaurum. A comparison of the strengths of inducible acetamidase and constitutive hsp60 promoters in M. smegmatis provided comparable results. Hydrocortisone biotransformation by M. smegmatis BD/pMhsp_k expressing kstD2NS resulted in 95.4% prednisolone yield, and the selectivity preferred that for N. simplex. Mycolicibacteria showed increased hydrocortisone degradation at 35 \u25e6C compared to 30 \u25e6C. The presence of endogenous steroid catabolism in Mycolicibacterium hosts does not seem to confer an advantage for the functioning of KstD2NS. The results allow for the evaluation of the prospects for the development of simple technological methods for the selective 1(2)-dehydrogenation of 3-ketosteroids by growing",

            "text": "Microbial 1,2-dehydrogenation is one of the most important reactions of structural modification of steroids [1] that plays a key role in the preparation of therapeutic steroids such as prednisone, prednisolone [2], 6\u03b1-metyl-prednisolone, as well as important synthons including androstadienedione (ADD), 20-hydroxymethylpregna-1,4-diene-3-one (HMPD) [3], 21-acetoxypregna-1(2),4(5),9(11),16(17)-tetraene-21-ol-3,20-dione (\u201ctetraene\u201d) [4], that are used in the syntheses of corticoids [5], anabolics [1] and anticancer drugs [6]. The presence of a C1-C2-double bond in ring A of the steroid core enhances the anti-inflammatory effect of the therapeutics and reduces side effects in comparison with their 1(2)-saturated analogues [7]. The ability to carry out 1(2)-dehydrogenation was demonstrated for the representatives of various microbial phyla; however, the highest level of activity was shown for actinobacteria of the genera Nocardioides, Mycolicibacterium, Nocardia, and Rhodococcus [1,8]. Among them, a special place is occupied by industrial strains of soil actinobacteria Nocardioides simplex (previously classified as Mycobacterium globiforme 193, Arthrobacter globiformis, Corynebacterium simplex, Arthrobacter simplex, and Pimelobacter simplex), since their resting,\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2720. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11112720 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2720 2 of 22\nprocessed, or immobilized cells are able to effectively dehydrogenate natural and synthetic steroid substrates [8,9]. In actinobacteria, 3-ketosteroid-1(2)-dehydrogenase (3-KSD, EC 1.3.99.4) is mainly an intracellular enzyme [10] and can be associated with the membrane (N. simplex) [11,12] or localized in the cytosol (Rhodococcus erythropolis) [13]. The enzyme contains a flavin prosthetic group (FAD), which is reduced upon dehydrogenation of the steroid substrate and transfers electrons to the respiratory chain [10,11,14]. In the genome of N. simplex VKM Ac-2033D (GenBank: CP009896.1), five genes were identified that putatively encode 3-KSDs [15]. The genes are distributed throughout the bacterial chromosome, expressed under the control of various transcriptional regulators, and differ significantly in the level of expression in response to steroids and sterols [16]. Induction of 3-KSD by androstenedione (AD) (Nocardia rhodochrous) [17], cortisone (Corynebacterium simplex) [18], and cortisone-21-acetate (AcC) (N. simplex) [9] has been shown. However, when using the whole cells, the undesirable side activities observed complicate further purification of the final crystalline 1(2)-dehydrogenated steroids. As shown for N. simplex and related actinobacteria, the most significant undesirable activity leads to the reduction of the 20-carbonyl group of steroids to the 20\u03b2-hydroxy group [8,9,12,19] in both the 1(2)-saturated steroid substrate and the 1(2)-dehydrogenated product (Figure 1). This modification is presumably associated with the activity of NAD(P)H-dependent 3\u03b1(or 20\u03b2)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (20\u03b2-HSD) previously found in strains of Streptomyces hydrogenans [20] and Bacillus megaterium [21], whose gene orthologues are also present in the genome of N. simplex Ac-2033D [15].\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 23\n[1,8].

Noteworthy, the engineering of N. simplex strains is complicated by the current lack of appropriate genetic tools [22,23]. On the contrary, the expression of 3-KSD genes in strains that do not have endogenous steroid catabolism (E. coli [5,23\u201330], Bacillus subtilis [5,25,31], Corynebacterium crenatum [32], and Pichia pastoris [33]) made it possible to effectively produce target steroids, but mainly in the presence of exogenous electron acceptors (EEA).

There are also reports indicating the increased production of 1(2)-dehydro-steroids by steroid-transforming actinobacteria bearing additional alleles of 3-KSDs genes [34,35]. For instance, expression in M. neoaurum NwIB-01 of either an additional copy of its own 3-KSD\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2720 3 of 22\ngene or heterologous expression of the 3-KSD gene from A. simplex 156 (IFO12069) led to an increase in the yield of ADD during phytosterol biotransformation [34]. The introduction of two additional copies of the genes of its own 3-KSD into the loci of the 16S rRNA genes of the strain Arthrobacter simplex 156 provided a 1.5-fold increase in the rate of conversion of cortisone acetate as compared with the initial strain [35]. In this work, recombinant strains of M. neoaurum and M. smegmatis were constructed that lack endogenous 3-ketosteroid-1(2)-dehydrogenase activity and express the kstD2 gene coding for 3-ketosteroid-1(2)-dehydrogenase from Nocardioides simplex VKM Ac-2033D (KstD2NS; GenBank: AIY19529.1) under the control of two different promoters; the in vivo activity of heterologous KstD2NS against model steroid substrates and undesirable activities of recombinant cells were studied in comparison with N. simplex."

To express kstD2NS in Mycolicibacterium cells, recombinant plasmids pMhsp_k, pMami_k, and pSM_k were constructed. For cloning in the pSMT3-MN vector, the gene kstD2NS was amplified from the total DNA of N. simplex VKM Ac-2033D with the kstD2nsf/kstD2nsr primer pair (Table S1). In the case of the vector pMVT61, a three-primer PCR method was used with primers kstD2nf2/kstD2nf3/kstD2nr (Table S1). At the same time, to prevent the fusion of the gene ORF with the 6xHis coding sequence and the TEV-protease recognition site, the TAA termination codon preceding the ATG translation start codon at a distance of six nucleotides upstream was introduced into the kstD2nf2 primer. The kstD2NS gene was cloned at the NdeI-HindIII sites to obtain pMami_k and pSM_k (Figure S1).

Steroids with 3-keto-4-en-configuration were evaluated under UV light at 254 nm. For other possible products and sterols, the plates were stained with MnCl2-reagent [44] and observed at 365 nm. HPLC analysis of phytosterol bioconversion products was performed on ODC columns with linear gradient elution as previously reported [45]. For 6\u03b1-methyl-hydrocortisone and derivatives, an isocratic elution with mobile phase acetonitrile:water:acetic acid (40:60:0.01, v/v/v) at 50 \u25e6C was applied. Hydrocortisone and products of its bioconversion were analyzed according to European Pharmacopoeia [46]. The HPLC signals were calibrated with external standards. In the case of some minor by-products, homologous steroids with 3-keto-4-ene- or 3-keto-1,4-diene chromophores were used for calibration."

            "text": "For the heterologous expression, the kstD2NS (KR76_27125; GenBank: AIY19529.1) gene was chosen from five genes of 3-KSDs present in the N. simplex VKM Ac-2033D genome. As shown previously, N. simplex exhibits low 3-ketosteroid-1,2-dehydrogenase activity without induction. The expression of kstD2NS was upregulated to the greatest extent in the presence of AcC, while the expression of other paralogs changed insignificantly in the presence of AcC or sterols, which indicates the predominant role of KstD2NS in the dehydrogenation of steroid substrates in N. simplex [16]. As model recipient organisms having endogenous steroid catabolism, the two strains M. neoaurum NRRL B-3805\u2206kstD [38] and M. smegmatis BD [39] were applied. These strains convert sterols into 1(2)-saturated 3-keto-4-en-steroids\u2014androst-4-en-3,17-dione (AD) and 20-hydroxymethyl-pregn-1-en-3-one (HMP). For both strains, the ability to reduce the 20-carbonyl group of steroids has not been previously described. A set of recombinant plasmids containing kstD2NS was constructed for expression of the gene in mycolicibacteria under the control of inducible acetamidase (pMami_k) or constitutive hsp60 (pSM_k and pMhsp_k) promoters (Table 1, Figure S1). Unlike the plasmids pMhsp_k (Figures S2a and S3a) and pMami_k (Figure S3a,b), the plasmid pSM_k was found to be structurally unstable in Mycolicibacterium cells. All the analyzed plasmids isolated from 40 HygR-transformants of M. smegmatis BD and 38 HygR-transformants of M. neoaurum obtained after transformation by pSM_k plasmid DNA contained deletions of various lengths (Figure S2b,c). Structural instability of plasmids derived from pSMT3 and containing cloned ORFs under the control of a strong constitutive hsp60 promoter was previously demonstrated in M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. smegmatis cells. It was shown that the deletions affected both the promoter and the coding region of the genes, while, apparently, the stability of the plasmids depended on the sequence of the inserted ORF [40,47,48]. Expression of the kstD2NS gene in M. neoaurum NRRL B-3805\u2206kstD and M. smegmatis BD cells carrying plasmids pMhsp_k and pMami_k was confirmed by analysis of cell lysates with SDS-PAGE (Figure S4). The analysis revealed an additional protein band of approximately 58 kDa, corresponding to the calculated Mr of a KstD2NS protein. Multiple alignments of the nucleotide sequence derived for the hsp60 promoter from the constructed vector pMV261-N with those previously published for the same locus of the plasmid pMV261 [41], the hsp60 sequence presented by Sun et al., 2020 [49], and the original sequence from Mycobacterium bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P2 [GenBank: AM408590] revealed some variability (Figure S5). Most importantly, the fragment from pMV261-N revealed a deletion of three nucleotides at positions 21\u201323 from the beginning of the XbaI site, which, however, did not result in a loss of hsp60 promoter functionality."

The trace products presumably were steroids with the 3-keto-4-ene- or 3-keto-1,4-diene-configuration of the steroid core, as evidenced by the high absorbance at 254 nm. Similar trace signals were also observed in the case of N. simplex. In addition, mycolicibacteria (but not N. simplex) produced three trace products that did not absorb UV at 254 nm and were detected on TLC after staining with MnCl2-reagent (Figure S7).

Closely related wild-type strains with their own 3-KSDs, such as M. neoaurum VKM Ac-1816D [50] and M. neoaurum JC-12 [51], produced under similar conditions more than 90% of 1(2)-dehydrogenated products in total. The recombinant M. neoaurum B-3805\u2206kstD/pMami_k 1(2)-dehydrogenated exogenous pregnane steroid substrates, both natural (hydrocortisone) and synthetic (6\u03b1-methylhydrocortisone). The activity towards the latter was significantly lower, which correlates with the data obtained earlier for N. simplex VKM Ac-2033D [52,53]. Recombinant strains derived from M. smegmatis showed a higher target 3-KSD activity towards hydrocortisone than strains based on the M. neoaurum host. Both parent strains (M. smegmatis BD and M. neoaurum B-3805\u2206kstD) and their recombinants showed some 20\u03b2reductase activity, but its level was significantly (in hundreds of times) lower as compared with that of growing N. simplex cells (Table S2) and was almost the same as shown earlier for the resting N. simplex [54]. Another undesirable activity that may accompany target 1(2)-dehydrogenation during a whole-cell biocatalysis is reverse reaction, \u2014reduction of the C1-C2-double bond to form the corresponding 1(2)-saturated steroids. This activity was firstly demonstrated in Mycolicibacterium sp. NRRL 3805 (later re-classified as Mycolicibacterium neoaurum) [55] and the corresponding enzyme was characterized as NADP(H)-dependent reductase [19,55]. However, since that time, no one has reported the gene coding for this reductase, and there is a discussion in the literature whether the same enzyme catalyze the 1(2)-dehydrogenation and the reverse reaction or not. In this study, we observed a very low level of endogenous steroid-1(2)-reducing activity toward prednisolone in Mycolicibacterium cells in the conditions applied. The presence of the NAD(H)-dependent 1-reductase activity towards ADD in two Mycolicibacterium strains has been recently demonstrated in vitro and in vivo [56]. The presence of 1-reductase activity in N. simplex has been evidenced earlier [11,57] and was confirmed in this study. Noteworthy, no 1(2)-hydrogenation was observed in N. simplex in the presence of EEA menadione. Menadione is able to bypass the electron transport chain of N. simplex from organic substrates to oxygen at the level of FAD\u2014menaquinone, creating a deficiency of reduced cofactors (NADH) in the cell and intensifying the 1,2-dehydrogenation of steroids. Optimal\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2720 16 of 22\nconcentrations of menadione were previously empirically selected for resting and starving N. simplex cells and made it possible to effectively prevent the residual activity of reducing the 20-carbonyl group of pregnane substrates [42,43]. In our experiments, growing N. simplex cells appeared to be able to compensate for the deficiency of reduced equivalents from endogenous or exogenous carbon sources, which promoted the reduction of the 20-carbonyl group of hydrocortisone and prednisolone (presumably an NADH-dependent process). At the same time, menadione hindered the reverse transfer of electrons from FAD to the steroid molecule, thereby preventing 1,2-hydrogenation. As reported earlier [34], expression of additional genes coding for 3-KSD under hsp60 control in M. neoaurum NwIB-01 resulted in an increased yield of ADD from AD (0.4 g/L). It is noteworthy that the introduction of an additional copy of the homologous KstDM gene increased the selectivity of ADD production to a greater extent (from 68.9% to 98.3\u201398.6%) than the introduction of an additional heterologous KstDA gene from A. simplex 156 (up to 86.5\u201391.1%). The data presented in this work allow us to estimate approximately the level of activity of additional 3-KSDs as an order of magnitude lower than that obtained by us for M. neoaurum B-3805\u2206kstD/pMami_k. At the same time, in the most successful studies on the expression of genes of heterologous 3-KSD in microbial hosts that do not possess endogenous sterol catabolism systems, significantly higher activities were demonstrated during the conversion of steroids by washed recombinant cells. Thus, the specific productivity at the conversion of hydrocortisone to prednisolone by E. coli BL21 cells expressing the synthetic prkstD gene [30] and the conversion of AD to ADD by B. subtilis cells expressing the codon-optimized kstD gene from M. neoaurum JC-12 [31] were approximately 30\u201340 times higher than the activity obtained in this study for M. smegmatis BD/pMhsp_k. Possible reasons for the lower activity of KstD2NS observed in our study may be a deficiency in the cells of mycolicibacteria of the necessary redox partners and insufficient level of the gene expression, or transport limitations through the cell wall for steroids. It should be noted that the level of KstD2NS activity in vivo was significantly higher in the recombinant strains derived from M. smegmatis mc2 155. This strain has a cell wall defect (mycolic acid deficiency) [58,59], which can presumably intensify the passive transport of hydrophobic steroid compounds. It was previously shown that the disruption of the proportion of mycolic acids in M. neoaurum ATCC 25795 due to the knockout of the kasB gene encoding \u03b2-ketoacyl carrier synthetase led to an increase in cell wall permeability for hydrophobic dyes and a 2.38-fold increase in the production of 9\u03b1-hydroxyandrostenedione from phytosterol [60]. The endogenous reverse activity of C1(2)-reduction in Mycolicibacterium strains observed in our work was negligible and cannot be the reason for the low apparent activity of KstD2NS. The acetamidase and hsp60 promoters used in this work were previously characterized by the expression of various genes in M. smegmatis as being among the strongest. When the genes coding for marker fluorescent proteins and the genes kshA and kshB encoding 3-ketosteroid-9\u03b1-hydroxylase were expressed in M. smegmatis, the hsp60 promoter was inferior in strength only to the artificial CP6 promoter [49]. Previously, the inducible acetamidase promoter from M. smegmatis mc2 155 [61] was successfully used for heterologous expression of genes of steroidogenesis in closely related strains [39]. In the current work, a direct comparison of the strengths of the acetamidase and hsp60 promoters was performed for the first time. The level of 3-KSD activity in recombinant M. smegmatis expressing kstD2NS under their control was comparable but slightly higher in the case of hsp60 (Table 2, Figure 5). In practice, the acetamidase promoter is less convenient since the induction of expression requires the introduction of a significant amount of acetamide, which can change the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Also, the hydrolysis of acetamide by bacterial cells can lead to alkalization of the medium. An important characteristic of potential producer strains is the level of undesirable degradation activity of steroid substrates. All studied strains under the described conditions had a limited ability to degrade hydrocortisone and convert it to a number of trace products.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2720 17 of 22\nThe maximum lack in material balance over the entire period of active conversion (until the maximum yield of prednisolone was reached) was observed at 35 \u25e6C and comprised 6.69 \u00b1 1.44% for M. smegmatis BD/pMV261-N (after 48 h) and 9.51 \u00b1 0.82% for M. neoaurum B-3805\u2206kstD/pMVT61 (after 120 h). The supposed steroid degradation by M. smegmatis BD strains decreased when the temperature was lowered to 30 \u25e6C (by 1.7\u20132.1 times) and with the use of more aged cells (by 2.7\u20135.2 times). The smallest amount of steroids involved in degradation during the period of active conversion (less than 0.5%) was observed in N. simplex and M. smegmatis BD/pMhsp_k (Table 2). The parent strain M. neoaurum B-3805\u2206kstD [38] used in this work was constructed on the basis of a known industrial AD producer obtained by statistical mutagenesis and showing no activity of 3-ketosteroid-9\u03b1-hydroxylase [62]. The strain M. smegmatis BD was obtained from M. smegmatis mc2 155 [63] by gene knockout of the reductase subunit of 3-ketosteroid-9\u03b1-hydroxylase kshB (MSMEG_6039_kshB) and the kstD gene (MSMEG_5941_kstD) [39]. Thus, in both parental strains, in contrast to N. simplex, a set of genes encoding key enzymes of steroid core degradation were inactivated [8]. Also, the ability to degrade sterol biotransformation products was not previously shown for them. In this work, in M. smegmatis BD cells, but not in M. neoaurum B-3805\u2206kstD cells, a slight 3-ketosteroid-1(2)-dehydrogenase activity was observed, apparently associated with the functioning of \u201cminor\u201d 3-KSD encoded by the kstD2 and kstD3 genes, and noticed in some mycolicibacteria [64]. The degradation of pregnane steroids by actinobacteria has not been sufficiently studied. The complete degradation of hydrocortisone by Rhodococcus zopfii without accumulation of intermediate products has been described, which presumably proceeds through 9-hydroxy11-keto-androstadienedione [65] with the opening of the steroid ring B. The Mycolicibacterium strains used in this work did not show the activity of 3-keto-steroid 9\u03b1-hydroxylase (KSH), which is necessary for opening the steroid ring B along with 3-KSD [38,39]. Along with kstD (MSMEG_5941_kstD) inactivated in the BD strain, there are three putative \u201cminor\u201d 3-KSD genes (MSMEG_2867, MSMEG_2869, and MSMEG_4864) in the M. smegmatis mc2 155 genome, whose level of expression slightly increases in response to 3-keto-steroids and cholesterol [64]. At the same time, activation of \u201cminor\u201d endogenous 3-KSD cannot lead by itself to the destruction of hydrocortisone but should increase the steroid-1(2)-dehydrogenase activity of control cells, which was not observed in the experiments. The significant level of hydrocortisone degradation observed in some cases may be associated with the functioning of \u201csilent pathways\u201d of steroid oxidation, such as the C-19+ catabolic pathway found in M. smegmatis mc2 155 [66]. Expression of the genes of the C-19+ pathway, located in the gene cluster of the same name, is tightly regulated and is not activated in the presence of phytosterol or C19-steroids. Despite the fact that the natural mechanisms of activation of the C-19+ pathway have not been established, it can be assumed that the expression of the genes of this cluster or a putative unknown operon containing minor genes for steroid catabolism was activated at incubation of mycolicybacteria in a nutrient medium with hydrocortisone and its conversion products at elevated temperature. The known temperature optima for both the growth and steroid-transforming activity of N. simplex VKM Ac-2033D or related strain A. simplex 156 are 30 or 32 \u25e6C, respectively [9,35]. As shown earlier, the temperature optima for the activity of heterologously expressed 3-KSDs from different mesophilic strains were within 30\u201335 \u25e6C [23,29\u201332] with the exception of 3-KSD from Mycobacterium neoaurum DSM 1381 expressed in E. coli (40 \u25e6C) [26]. Meanwhile, activity of two KstDs (KstD2, KstD3) from M. neoaurum NwIBR10hsd4A expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) was inhibited with an increase in temperature from 30 to 37 \u25e6C [67]. In our study, the low KstD2NS activity in M. neoaurum/pMami_k cells observed at 30 \u25e6C decreased to an almost negligible level with an increase in temperature of only 5 \u25e6C. On the contrary, while using M. smegmatis BD as the host strain, the activity of KstD2NS in vivo was slightly higher at 35 \u25e6C, which correlated with the higher temperature optimum of the host strain.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2720 18 of 22"

It was found that KstD2NS was functional in mycolicibacteria; however, the specific activity towards hydrocortisone was noticeably higher when using M. smegmatis BD compared to M. neoaurum as a host strain. The strengths of the inducible acetamidase and constitutive hsp60 promoters in M. smegmatis strains expressing kstDNS were found to be similar, but in the case of hsp60, slightly higher target activity was noted against the background of greater ease of operation. The strain M. smegmatis BD in combination with constructed pMami_k and pMhsp_k recombinant plasmids turned out to be convenient tools for in vivo estimation of the individual activity of the heterologous 3-KSD. The high selectivity of M. smegmatis BD/pMhsp_k as a biocatalyst was demonstrated, thus indicating the promise of a technologically simple approach for 1(2)-dehydrogenation of steroids with growing actinobacterial cells expressing heterologous genes of 3-KSD. Further research will be aimed at increasing recombinant biocatalyst productivity using mycolicibacterial hosts with active intrinsic 3-KSD and heterologous expression of kstDs from other sources.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms11112720/s1, Figure S1: Graphical representation of the construction of recombinant expression plasmids pMhsp_k, pMami_k, and pSM_k containing kstD2NS; Figure S2: Analysis of plasmid DNA isolated from Mycolicibacterium KmR-transformants.
