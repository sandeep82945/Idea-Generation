Improving Token-Level Quality Estimation Models: Enhancing the accuracy of token-level quality estimation (QE) models could significantly impact the overall quality of generated texts. Future research could focus on developing more sophisticated models that better understand context, ambiguity, and the nuances of language. This could involve incorporating advanced NLP techniques such as transformers with attention mechanisms, exploring unsupervised learning methods to leverage larger datasets without explicit labeling, or integrating external knowledge bases to improve the semantic understanding of tokens.

Adapting the Method to More NLP Tasks: While the paper discusses paraphrasing, summarisation, and constrained text generation, future research could explore the application of the N-best ensembling method to other NLP tasks such as machine translation, question-answering, and dialogue systems. Investigating the effectiveness of this method across a wider array of tasks could help in understanding its limitations and strengths, as well as tailoring the approach to specific challenges encountered in different areas of NLP.

Exploring Dynamic Lexical Constraints Generation: The study leverages static lexical constraints based on the N-best hypotheses. Future work could explore dynamic generation of constraints that evolve during the decoding process, based on the tokens selected in previous steps. This could help in adapting the generation process more flexibly to the unfolding context and might lead to improvements in generating coherent and contextually relevant texts.

Cross-Lingual and Multimodal Applications: Extending the N-best ensembling method to cross-lingual contexts and multimodal applications could be a fruitful area of research. For example, in cross-lingual NLP tasks, leveraging high-quality fragments from multiple languages might improve translation quality. Similarly, in multimodal tasks such as image captioning or video summarization, integrating visual or auditory cues into the lexical constraints could enhance the relevance and accuracy of generated texts.

Investigating the Impact of Beam Size and N-best Selection Criteria: The paper mentions the use of a grid search to determine the optimal beam size for different tasks. Future research could delve deeper into the impact of beam size and the selection criteria for the N-best hypotheses on the quality of the generated text. This includes exploring adaptive beam sizes that change based on the complexity of the sentence or the context, as well as developing more sophisticated criteria for selecting the N-best candidates that balance diversity and quality.
