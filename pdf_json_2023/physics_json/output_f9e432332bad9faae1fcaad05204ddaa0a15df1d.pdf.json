The 3J-proton-proton coupling information in the COSY spectrum led to the assignment of four continuous spin systems from H-2/H-3/H2-4/H2-5/H-6, H2-8/H2-9/H-10, H2-12/H2-13, and H-14/H3-15 (H3-16) (Fig. 2).

The presence of an isopropyl group at C-1 was substantiated by the HMBC correlations from H-14, H3-15, H3-16 to C-1. The above analysis enabled the establishment of the carbon skeleton of 1.

An acetyl group at C-3 was conrmed by the HMBC correlations from themethine proton at dH 3.16 (H-3) to the ketonic carbonyl at dC 210.0 (C-17); the other HMBC correlations from the methyl protons resonating at dH 2.06 (H3-18) to C-17 ketonic carbonyl (dC 210.0) and C-3 methine (dC 49.9), further supporting that this group was positioned at C-3.\nThe relative stereochemistry of 1 was determined based on correlations obtained from NOESY experiments. In the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 3), H-10 exhibited cross-peaks with H-3 and one of the diastereotopic methylene protons at C-12 (dH 1.07, H12b); and H-12b was correlated with H-3 but not with H3-20, which illustrated the b-orientations of H-3 and H-10, and the aorientation of Me-20.

The four possible relative congurations were inputted into Spartan\u201916 and optimized at the MMFF94 level.11\u201313 The predicted distance of key NOESY of possible congurations is shown in Table 2. The 1-3S*, 10R*, 11R* displayed the best result matching the experimental key NOESY correlations, and the calculated single optical rotation (SOR) value of 1-3S, 10R, 11R and 1-3R, 10S, 11S were +226 and \u2212226, respectively. Comparing the calculated with the experimental SOR value of 1 (+236), the absolute conguration of 1 could be assigned as 3S, 10R, 11R.\nDue to the conformational mobility of the macrocycle, the stereochemistry of the stereogenic centers C-3, C-10, and C-11 of 1 would be further determined from an X-ray diffraction analysis. Regarding validation of the structure of 1, a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was employed. The structure of 1 was fully established by X-ray crystallography, as observed by Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.54178 \u00c5) and the Flack parameter x = 0.0(3).14,15 The X-ray structure (Fig. 4) demonstrates the location of an acetyl group at C-3 and an epoxy group between C-10/11 in the 13-membered macrocycle ring. Based on the X-ray diffraction analysis, the stereogenic centers in 1 were assigned as 3S, 10R, 11R. From the above ndings, the structure, including the absolute conguration, of 1 was therefore elucidated unambiguously.\nChlorofurancembranoid B (2), a cytotoxic cembranoid toward human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, was reported in our previous publication, and its stereochemistry was established by combination of a NOESY experiment.5 Thus, in order to determine the absolute conguration.

The structure of 1, including the absolute conguration, was determined by spectroscopic methods and further conrmed by a single-crystal Xray diffraction analysis and this compound showed cytotoxicity toward the HL-60 tumor cells.
