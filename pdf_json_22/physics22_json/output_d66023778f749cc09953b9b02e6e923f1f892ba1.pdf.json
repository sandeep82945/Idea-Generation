INTRODUCTION\nIAGNOSTIC tools are crucial in understanding performance of superconducting accelerator magnets for which the designs and technology continually develop. Instrumentation is needed which has both high spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a variety of sensor types in order to fully understand and describe the complex phenomena driving magnet performance - particularly affected by quenching and its dependencies. FNAL has developed new type of arrays based on flexible printed-circuit board technology and quench antenna sensing, flex-QA [1], to help address the diagnostic needs here. Earlier studies with individual small QA [1], [2] indicated significant potential of this approach and mixed-type array configurations for long magnets [3] also proved the concept viable. Flex-QAs from one of the newly designed arrays were embedded in a mirror magnet [4], following the curved aperture and facing the coil at ~ 5 mm distance. The same design was also tested later at a specially developed room temperature test stand [1], where tests were subsequently also completed on several other flexQA designs.\nThis work was supported by Fermi Research Alliance, LLC, under Contract DE-AC02-07CH11359 with the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of High Energy Physics.(Corresponding author: Stoyan Stoynev.)\nThe authors are with Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL\nIn this paper, we describe the work on QA data acquired from a superconducting magnet, along with the resulting analysis and insights. We explore bench-testing techniques relatable to the experiment and compare to simulations. We additionally examine features of the different flex-QA arrays, obtained on the warm test stand, to guide us to improved designs. Main points are discussed, and conclusions are drawn."

It features 20 independent diagonal channels on a rectangular panel with sensitive area 80 mm x 460 mm. Two lengths of those cover the inner layer coil area, given the coil active area was ~ 80 cm long and had 60 mm aperture. Two panels were connected in series (20 channels total) and two others placed on top of them individually (40 channels together) to form a grid of 60 channels as presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows an actual picture of the flex-QAs with the 3D printed support seen under the panels. Features on the coil, QA arrangements and magnet parts (laminations) were all used together to relate geometrically the coil-to-QA coordinates with the goal of matching positions to better than 1 mm.

            "text": "The magnet under consideration in this paper was part of other developments [4] and its test program started at 4.5 K. Most magnets quench predominantly in their coil inner layer(s) where the field is higher, and the first quench in our test was in the inner layer. This layer was instrumented with voltage taps and based on those we knew the likely quench location was somewhere around the second spacer/end-part, within ~40 cm cable length. We also had acoustic sensors installed on both magnet ends and, given that the first quench yielded fairly large mechanical signals, we triangulated the likely source to within 10 cm range in longitudinal direction.\nWith typical noise level at below 1 mV, we identified many QA signals above the noise at a distinctive time which we identified as quench time. Flex-QA quench time was typically few ms before visible voltage rise from the quenching voltage tap segment, as observed in previous work with flex-QA as well [1]. While QA signals show complex behavior over time, the first reaction to quench is a sharp peak(s) developing within 200 micro-seconds. Within our time resolution of 10 micro-seconds\nall channels featuring this peak reacted simultaneously. The magnitude of the peaks however differed, and we used it to associate highest level channels to geometrical origin of current redistribution. The highest peaks in quench one, 16 mV and 14 mV, were seen in channels shown on Figures 1 (dotted), 3 (highlighted) and 4 with 12 other channels reaching peak magnitudes of 2-8 mV. The precise quench location from QA was consistent with the rough voltage tap based constraints around the pole turn and the axial constraints from the acoustic signals. Thus, multiple diagnostics tools can be utilized for building a coherent and richer picture although VTs and acoustics were not quite sensitive enough to provide good location in this case.\nMost of the quenches in this magnet test occurred in the outer layer, there were tens of those quenches. The flex-QA array was sensitive enough to register all of them \u2013 inner layer quenches went to an immediate-signal/noise ratio of over 35 while outer layer ones were at a ratio of up to 10. Fig 4. shows a zoomed in version of typical quench patterns. We identified four distinctive patterns, including time dependencies, and the one on the right was associated with almost all outer layer quenches. The channels with highest amplitudes at the time of quench (within 200 micro-seconds) point to a spot in the non-lead end of the outer layer, approximately consistent with coil damage regions as discussed in [4]. Fig. 5 is another geometrical representation of flex-QA array signals incorporating the need for correlated processing. It shows sensitivity at particular time slice, with sensitivity for cross-channels (1,2) defined as s = sqrt(M1*M2), where M is signal normalized to std. dev. computed \u201cprequench\u201d ([-0.2, -0.1] s) and based on running average over 1 ms. Noise filtering could improve sensitivity further but is not applied here. Those and other representations revealed a \u201cweak\u201d spot in the non-lead end outer layer associable to quenches. This area consistently sees current redistribution in adjacent QA channels up to the quench detection time. The same area was active between quench and quench detection\ncoil is seen from \u201cbelow\u201d and QA images are taken from \u201cabove\u201d ).\nplaced on \u201cmirror\u201d iron blocks which are part of the \u201cmirror\u201d magnet.\ntimes even in the first quench which was in the inner layer. Thus, evidence suggests the main damage to the coil outer layer was done at or before the first spontaneous quenching occurred."

            "text": "The QA warm test stand (WTS), [1] and Fig. 6 (left), allows to position and control a current source (loop) close to a QA board(s) under testing. After experimenting, we decided to adopt a loop of 2 cm diameter oriented in \u201cY-Z\u201d plane (Y is along sensor length) emulating the cable plane at the straight section in a magnet during current redistribution and quench propagation. The current loop is fixed with the help of a shaper attached to the positioning system. The lowest point of it is maintained at ~ 1 mm from the QA surface during measurements, to allow for proper signal-to-noise ratio, Fig. 6 (right).\nFlex-QA arrays were placed in horizontal positions aligned and fixed in the \u201cX-Y\u201d plane. To minimize electrical noise, we had to cover the surface under the QA board with aluminum foil and grounded it which eliminated any modulation in most cases. The signal noise level was as low as 0.2 mV although few individual channels reached ~1 mV modulated (i.e. still reducible) noise. The boards were placed parallel to the motion system coordinate frame within a very good degree, given the length of boards was ~ 0.5 m. However, the flatness of boards within parts of mm cannot be guaranteed. As the current source was 1 mm away, some \u201cwaviness\u201d, largely due to QA manufacturing and material features, may be expected.\nA generator-controlled power supply was used to provide current of 12 A in the form of square waves with 100 Hz frequency. Data was recorded with the same DAQ system used for the cold magnet test and same sampling rate of 100 kHz.\nWTS measurements can serve multiple purposes. Response of QA channels are recorded and effectively used for relative calibration. Crosstalk effects are checked and investigated. Abnormal behavior in particular channels/board can also be pinpointed. Current redistribution models or orientation dependencies, in the form of current loop(s) characteristics, can be studied. Most importantly, sensitivity within the QA arrays can be probed which affects design choices or applicability to cases. Finally, WTS can be utilized to emulate observed responses in real magnets, given a proper current shape is provided; and, ultimately, help to explain or predict real responses. Elaborated\nQA sets could be assessed there before committing to cold-test application while simulations could be benchmarked in advance of cold testing."

            "text": "The flex-QA arrays we developed had two separate main features \u2013 inclined with respect to border lines sensors, a.k.a. \u201cdiagonal\u201d design, and \u201ctriangle-pair\u201d bucked design forming a rectangular sensor. We fabricated both, keeping the sensor width the same, 8 mm, and overall length and width of the different boards also the same ([1], Fig 5). The \u201cdiagonal\u201d design, used in magnet testing, featured 20 sensors of variable length per board. The \u201ctriangle-pair\u201d design consisted of 10 equivalent sensors, each having six identical sections of bucked \u201ctrianglepairs\u201d, all sections connected in series.\nFig. 6 (right) shows QA response to a single current \u201cjump\u201d; the decay constant , primarily driven by the system and not the QA channels, is ~ 0.2 ms. Thus, the half-period of signal modulation corresponds to 25 .\nThe \u201cdiagonal\u201d sensors have a clear symmetry defined by their mid-line and Fig. 7 confirms a dead-zone near the line of symmetry. By design this symmetry line is not along the current or quench propagation and is thus a limited \u201cblind-spot\u201d in practice. The response at channel edges is very strong which allows relatively strong readout of multiple channels at a given time/position, Fig 7 (bottom), when the source scans the board width, Fig. 7 (top). As long as noise or systematic effects are negligible, having multiple sensors providing scaled response is of utmost importance to pin-point current variation sources. Alternatively, these give a strong clue about acceptable sensor sizes, assuming emulation of current source relative location to QA sensor is satisfactory.\nThe \u201cdiagonal\u201d QA array showed multiple occasions of reproducible \u201ccross-talk\u201d: the noise floor (average read-out value without signal) is affected by signal in neighboring channel(s). We do not know yet the source of this systematic problem and it was not the case for all channels. We did not observe similar\nbehavior before, in short or long single or multiple adjacent short channels. Crosstalk is a serious issue if one wants to use a multi-channel approach for providing better spatial resolution. It is instructive to note that the \u201ctriangle-pair\u201d design showed no such problem but manufacturers, along with other parameters, were different between QA board designs.\nFig. 8 shows scan directions across channels (comprised of multiple \u201csections\u201d) of the \u201ctriangle pair\u201d design (top) and resulting signal (bottom). The response to signal above the middle part of a section (see Fig. 9 (left)) is particularly insensitive close to channel edges where an \u201cisland\u201d is present at each edge; the adjacent channels are insensitive for the same reason. By design, current and quench propagation is not parallel to the \u201cisland\u201d lines and thus dead-zones have limited practical length. Although not shown, inflection points (low signal) are also present between sections of a single channel. Sectioning cannot be avoided for long and narrow channels without introducing too long dead-zones in real applications. The advantages of the \u201ctriangle-pair\u201d design relate to robustness against noise. A main disadvantage is that having less sensitivity along edges of channels is apparently worse suited for multi-channel use."

            "text": "We explore simple simulation [3] where a current doublet with a length 1/5 of a channel section of the \u201ctriangle pair\u201d design acts on the simulated version of the sensor. On Fig. 9 the pair is emphasized on a picture (left) and results from simulations shown along with the shapes from WTS data (right). In the simulation the doublet, approximating a current redistribution source in a magnet and resembling the WTS probe (i.e., 2 cm diameter over a 8-cm-long section), is moved along the width of the sensor at five adjacent positions along its length and fixed distance from the sensor surface. The simulation describes well how the signal changes from one side to the other over the sensor width/length and is consistent with data (in data we change signal polarity while moving the source; in the analytic simulation we calculate the absolute flux/voltage). It is apparent that behavior is reproducible and understandable to a\ngood degree even though some parameters (e.g. round probe vs a straight doublet) deviate. It is a good start to tune simulations with different simple sources on various designs and then move to more elaborate source shapes which may describe the 3Dshapes of real magnet current redistribution better.\nSimulations will have to be also employed to resolve convoluted signals in data. The initial spike we associate with quench start has the characteristic decay of our DAQ system (~0.2 s decay constant) but it is followed by other spikes and more gradual signal changes, many of them higher than the initial spike amplitude. At conceptual level this can be interpreted as consecutive fast current redistribution steps (each within tens to hundreds of micro-seconds), possibly from individual strands being shut off and on during current sharing and quenching [5]. Refined simulation studies are needed to describe the actual process with a good level of confidence.\nCONCLUSION\nWe demonstrate how a flex-QA arrays can be used to pinpoint quench locations with remarkable precision. They are very reliable, and signals are well above noise. We identified all quench starts in a superconducting magnet test well before quench detection and before any visible voltage rise in the conductor - this includes tens of quenches in the outer layer with the whole thickness of the inner coil layer between current redistribution location and the QA sensors. Our \u201cwarm\u201d test stand studies indicated some weaknesses in the QA designs and possibly unavoidable imperfections but also showed that multichannel sensitivity to quenches can serve as an additional tool to improve precision. Time development is yet to be fully explored along with more detailed studies on flex-QA designs at the warm test stand and in actual cryogenic magnet testing."
