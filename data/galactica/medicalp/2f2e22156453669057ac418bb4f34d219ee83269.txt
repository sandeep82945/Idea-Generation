Integrin LFA-1 plays a critical role in T-cell migration and in the formation of immunological synapses. LFA-1 functions through interacting with its ligands with differing affinities: low, intermediate, and high. Most prior research has studied how LFA-1 in the high-affinity state regulates the trafficking and functions of T cells. LFA-1 is also presented in the intermediate-affinity state on T cells, however, the signaling to activate LFA-1 to the intermediate-affinity state and the role of LFA-1 in this affinity state both remain largely elusive. This review briefly summarizes the activation and roles of LFA-1 with varied ligand-binding affinities in the regulation of T-cell migration and immunological synapse formation. 1.
