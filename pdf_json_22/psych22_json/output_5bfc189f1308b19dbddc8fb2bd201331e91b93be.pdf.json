    "abstractText": "Background: To analyze the impact of the flood disasters, social support and personality on the mental health of residents in Henan Province, China, providing fundamental knowledges for making measuring strategies to improve the psychological protection and anti-stress ability of the residents after the disaster. Material and Methods: A cross-section study was conducted via an online survey platform \u201cquestionnaire star,\u201d which included 572 residents in Henan Province, which underwent the history of ever flood disaster on July 20. The questionnaires of Impact of Event Scale-Revised Edition (IES-R), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the scales of Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R) version in Chinese were also administered to each participant. Generalized linear regression model was performed. Results: The residents who live in the flooding areas, are male and married had a  significantly higher post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) score than their counterparts. The scores of depression-anxiety-stress in the residents with stable emotion were significantly lower than those with unstable emotion (p < 0.001). Machine learning showed that PTSD ranked the top risk factor, followed by neuroticism for Depression-Anxiety-Stress after disaster. The PTSD was negatively correlated with social support (p < 0.01), while it was positively correlated with depression-anxiety-stress and emotional stability (p < 0.01). There was a statistically significant interaction between PTSD, social support and neuroticism on depression-anxiety-stress (p < 0.001), with an independent effect of 1.4% on depression-anxiety-stress. Emotional stability showed the largest association with depression-anxiety-stress. Conclusions: Residents living in the catastrophic flooding areas had significant post-traumatic mental health issues, and the severity of mental problems was differently affected by post-traumatic stress disorder and social support in individuals with different personalities. Introvert and PTSD were the major risk factors for depression-anxiety-stress after the disaster. Med Pr. 2022;73(4):305\u201314",

When facing an unexpected disaster, individuals are susceptible to a\u00a0 series of adverse physical, emotional, cognitive behavioral reactions. These adverse responses are manifested by such as headache, insomnia, anxiety, nervousness, fear, sadness, depression, anger, irritability, inattention, memory loss and even life changes in beliefs and personality\u00a0[2].\nPost-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) is a\u00a0 common mental health disorder that are associated with\ntraumatic events. For example, approximately one third individuals had PTSD when they had motor cycle crashes or road traffic crash, and this disorder could persist over time\u00a0[3,4]. A\u00a0major earthquake disaster occurring in Sichuan several years ago led to a\u00a0high percentage of orphan survivors with PTSD\u00a0[5\u20137]. Preventing chronic psychological injury in the\u00a0early post-trauma period is needed to alleviate or prevent the\u00a0occurrence of PTSD. Accumulating evidence suggest that social support plays an important role in the\u00a0 prevention of post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Social support may help alleviate job-related burnout in professional health workers\u00a0[8,9]. A\u00a0negative correlation was observed between the\u00a0severity of PTSD in individuals living in the\u00a0disaster area and the\u00a0overall perception of social support\u00a0[10]. Similarly, social support was reported to significantly reduce the\u00a0severity of trauma symptom in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and low back pain\u00a0[11].\nSeveral previous studies have shown that personality is associated with the\u00a0 severity of PTSD\u00a0 [12,13]. Individuals with low neuroticism had relatively weaker PTSD than those with high neuroticism when they suffered the\u00a0same trauma event\u00a0[12]. Marked impulsivity, aggression and a\u00a0susceptibility to anti-sociality and substance abuse was observed in persons who had high negative emotionality and low constraint/inhibition when they experienced traumatic events\u00a0[13]. The\u00a0positive association between personality of neuroticism and PTSD is also validated, whereas a\u00a0negative correlation between extroversion and PTSD exists, in the\u00a0meta-analysis studies\u00a0[14,15].\nA higher incidence of negative emotions such as anxiety and depression frequently occur during the\u00a0emergency of major public health issues. The\u00a0higher the\u00a0 degree of anxiety or depression is, the\u00a0 greater the\u00a0perception of stress. Natural disasters may add additional stress on persons particularly who are in the\u00a0suffer, increasing their anxiety and depression. Flooding has been shown to significantly increase depression (adjust odds ratio (OR)\u00a0= 7.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.51\u201340.13) and anxiety (OR\u00a0= 4.16, 95% CI: 1.18\u2013 14.70) in a\u00a0previous study conducted in England\u00a0[16]. In\u00a0China, an intervention study showed that a\u00a0systemic planned intervention, including planned settlements, intensive health service and environmental interventions, could significantly reduce depression, anxiety and flooding-associated PTSD\u00a0[17].\nThe flooding disaster recently occurring in Henan Province has led to the\u00a0huge loss of lives and properties in the\u00a0local area. Attention is worthy of being paid\nto the\u00a0mental health of the\u00a0residents living in the\u00a0disaster-affected area. Keeping calm emotion and offering social support to the\u00a0population are important in helping the\u00a0individuals to walk out of the\u00a0disaster-induced psychological injuries. Yao et\u00a0 al.\u00a0 [8] has reported that professional health workers with different personality characteristics had significant performance and different outcomes when they faced job-related stress. However, it is yet to be determined how personality affects the\u00a0mental health in the\u00a0residents who experienced catastrophic flooding in Henan, China.\nThe purpose of this study was to analyze the\u00a0associations between residents\u2019 traumatic stress disorder, social support, mental health status, and personality type after experiencing the\u00a0natural disasters. This study hypothesized that individuals with different personality had different psychological responses when they faced the\u00a0natural flooding disaster, which occurred in Henan, China."

Traumatic stress response and neuroticism had a\u00a0 significantly positive association with depression-anxiety-stress, while extroversion and women showed a\u00a0 significantly negative association. No significant associations were found for social support and age with depression-anxiety-stress. In\u00a0 the\u00a0 model 2, a\u00a0 2-way interaction term of traumatic stress disorder, social support, extroversion and neuroticism was added beyond the\u00a0model 1. The\u00a0main effects of gender, traumatic stress disorder, neuroticism and extroversion variables remained significant.

Figure\u00a02 shows that as the\u00a0 traumatic stress response increases, the\u00a0 depression-anxiety-stress of the\u00a0 affected residents gets worse. Residents with the\u00a0same level of traumatic stress disorder, high social support and low neuroticism had a\u00a0 lower depression-anxiety-stress score compared to those with low social support and high neuroticism. Compared with social support, neuroticism has a\u00a0more obvious effect on depression-anxiety-stress when experiencing high traumatic stress; individuals with low neuroticism had a\u00a0lower depression-anxiety-stress score than those with high neuroticism."

This finding seems inconsistent with some other studies, which reported that women had higher lifetime prevalence of PTSD than men\u00a0 [22]. One possibility may be due to the\u00a0 traditional belief that men should take more responsibilities in the\u00a0family and society, and they usually have greater psychological pressure. A\u00a0previous study performed in China also demonstrated that men were more susceptible to psychological problems such as depression-anxiety-stress after a\u00a0natural disaster\u00a0[5]. A\u00a0higher score of traumatic stress disorder and stress was also observed in married individuals compared to those singles in this study. Married individuals usually have more family responsibility, there may have both kids, parents and siblings to take care, more economic burden on shoulders\u00a0[23], and will always worry about the\u00a0safety and situation of family members during emergencies. In\u00a0addition, there is a\u00a0 positive correlation between the\u00a0 traumatic stress disorder and depression-anxiety-stress. This finding is in agreement with the\u00a0 previous observation that the\u00a0traumatic stress burden resulted in uncontrollable worries in individuals, and stress could directly trigger negative emotions such as anxiety and depression\u00a0[24].\nIt has been reported that when facing emergency and stress, individuals with different personalities take different actions and have different responses. Those with stable emotion could calmly challenge the\u00a0stress and emergency situations, displaying less fluctuations in their physiological response under stress, and showing strong self-adjustment ability\u00a0[25]. Emotional unstable individuals are more likely to be impulsive and anxious than those with stable emotion\u00a0[26], while extrovert individuals usually have more social networks, often participate in group activities, and get more social supports from friends and relatives. The\u00a0individuals who are extroverted and stable emotion usually can keep calm in stress or emergency, and can deal with various difficulties more rationally. In\u00a0contrast, those with instable emotion may have anxiety and stressful feeling under these situations. Individuals with neuroticism or unstable emotion have higher PTSD compared to those with extrovert and stable emotion\u00a0[15]. It\u00a0can be found that the\u00a0interactions existing between traumatic stress disorder, social support and neuroticism (emotional stability) in depression-anxiety-stress when they faced the\u00a0natural disaster. When the\u00a0individuals faced the\u00a0flooding-caused damage\nand loss, those with high social support and stable emotion had the\u00a0best mental health status. Regardless of social support, those with stable emotions had better mental health than those with unstable emotion particularly at high PTSD. These findings suggest that emotion management and psychological aids may be an important measurement in prevention of PTSD and disaster-related depression-anxiety-stress or mental health problems.\nTo a\u00a0certain extent, the\u00a0amount of social support depends on social networks an individual owns. Personality usually can affect the\u00a0plenty of social networks; those with extrovert and stable emotion may have more social networks and may actively seek help from friends and relatives, whereas those with introvert and unstable emotion may be shameful to seek help from others or may have difficulties in making friends. Thus, when they faced the\u00a0difficulties or the\u00a0disaster-induced stress, individuals with different personalities had different outcomes in mental health. The\u00a0findings in the\u00a0interaction between traumatic stress disorder, social support and personality in mental health are in agreement with the\u00a0 previous observations that extrovert individuals with stable emotion often adopt active coping styles to solve problem and seek help when they encounter difficulties and emergencies, and they receive higher social support.\nSocial support and friendship help play an important role in maintaining the\u00a0mental health\u00a0[27]. Similarly, the\u00a0prevalence of depression (suicide thoughts and behaviors) increased in the\u00a0building-collapse survivors\nwhen they felt desperate with less social supports\u00a0[28]. Another nightclub fire disaster study also showed a\u00a0positive association between negative emotion personality and PTSD\u00a0[29]. Thus, social support to those who suffer natural disasters on time is an effective measurement to prevent PTSD, and improve their mental health, making them feel warm from society, relatives and friends, and fill their heart with full hope of live, they are not alone. Interestingly, in this study, there is a\u00a0significant interaction existing between traumatic stress disease (PTSD), social support and neuroticism but not between PTSD, social support and extroversion in depression-anxiety-stress. One possibility is the\u00a0 most likely when people face such a\u00a0 large scale natural disaster, it is a\u00a0 challenge for everybody no matter how extrovert they are. However, the\u00a0disaster-causing stress may deteriorate the\u00a0mental health problem for those neuroticism. Thus, neuroticism individuals should be granted with high priority more social support to prevent mental problem.\nIn this study, 2 scales of IES-R and DASS-21 were applied to detect psychological disorder for PTSD and depression-anxiety-stress, respectively. Both IES-R and DASS-21 have been shown suitable for use in clinical and compensation setting to detect PTSD and major depression disorder in a\u00a0 motor vehicle crashes study, demonstrating both scales with acceptable sensitivity and specificity in an injured individuals engaged in compensation\u00a0 [3]. However, 2 scales were applied in this study based on their applications initially designed, IES-R specifically for PTSD and DASS-21 for depression-anxiety-stress, respectively. The\u00a0 IES-R has 3 subscale measurements: Intrusion (i.e.,\u00a0intrusive thoughts, nightmares, intrusive feelings and imagery), Avoidance (e.g.,\u00a0avoidance of feelings, situations and ideas, responsiveness numbing) and Hyperarousal (e.g.,\u00a0 anger, irritability, hypervigilance)\u00a0 [30]. This scale was used for traumatic stress disorder measurement after the flooding. The DASS-21 assesses 3 dimensions: Depression (e.g.,\u00a0hopelessness, lack of interest or involvement, inertia), Anxiety (e.g.,\u00a0 autonomic arousal, anxious), and Stress (e.g.,\u00a0irritable, upset, over-reaction, nervous), and this scale was used to measure the\u00a0comprehensive depression-anxiety-stress (not only from the\u00a0flooding, but also due to other factors). Interestingly, there is a\u00a0significant interaction existing between neuroticism, social support and traumatic stress disorder, suggesting that personality could modify the\u00a0effect of PTSD and social support on depression-anxiety-stress in the\u00a0 residents living in the\u00a0flooding area in Henan, China.\nSome limitations exist in this study. First, the crosssection study design was applied for the\u00a0survey, and it is a\u00a0time point snapshot for all variables. Thus, it could not be infered a\u00a0causal relationship except the\u00a0association, which may be accompanied only. A\u00a0 longitudinal or intervention study may help to address the\u00a0causal inference. Secondly, the\u00a0 participants voluntarily signed in to fill the\u00a0online questionnaires, the\u00a0selection of subjects may have a\u00a0 bias, e.g, women are far more than men in the\u00a0 number (or proportion), and the\u00a0 samples may not well represent the\u00a0 population. Moreover, although 2\u00a0 different psychological stress questionnaires (IES-R vs. DASS-21) were used, and could not be clearly dissected each other. However, one of the\u00a0strengths of this study is that the\u00a0 sample size is relatively large. In\u00a0addition, this study was conducted immediately after the\u00a0flooding, and it may limit some recall bias and different intervention measurement effects in the\u00a0survey."

It\u00a0showed that personality modified the\u00a0effect of traumatic stress disorder and social support on mental health. Individuals who have stable emotion had a\u00a0 better mental health compared to those who have unstable emotion even when they are at the\u00a0 same level of traumatic stress disorder. These findings suggest that personality consideration may be helpful in improvement of mental health after the\u00a0disaster when psychological aids and social support reach out. However, further follow-up studies are warranted to investigate the\u00a0effect of different strategies or measurements on the\u00a0 prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder."
