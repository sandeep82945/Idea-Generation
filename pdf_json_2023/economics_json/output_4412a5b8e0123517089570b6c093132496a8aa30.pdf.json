    "abstractText": "Low-income communities have limited capital and access to money or loans from formal financial institutions. To solve the problems, the government provides solutions, one of them is by forming a microfinance program, namely Rural Agribusiness Business Development (PUAP). PUAP program is one of the grant activities to farmer group association (Gapoktan) with a total capital assistance of IDR 100 million. The problem with the 52,186 Gapoktan units that participated in PUAP activities, only 7,703 units (15%) were transformed into Agribusiness Microfinance Institutions (LKMA). This paper differs from others as it briefly explains the PUAP/MFI\u2019s institutional transformation and the factors that affect its sustainability, which is so far still limited discussed. The paper aims to see what transformations Gapoktan becomes an inclusive LKMA and the level of sustainability of the LKMA. The research was conducted in Kendal Regency, Central JavaIndonesia, in 2022 on 5 LKMA. The process of transforming LKMA into an inclusive financial institution is analyzed descriptively. LKMA sustainability levels were analyzed using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach with the Rapfish application. So far, MDS with the Rapfish application is still very limited for microfinance analysis. MDS analysis is employed because it is relatively simple and effective for looking at sensitive attributes in improving sustainability and generating leverage attributes that can be used for policy-making. The result study shows that the transformation of PUAP into LKMA is driven by the ability to improve legality, financial governance and diversify the customer\u2019s business field. The five LKMAs have a sustainability status of \u2019sufficient\u2019 in running their business, with an index value of more than 50%. The study recommends 1) the Indonesian government could assist LKMA in improving its legality and 2) LKMA\u2019s management should get training by experts to improve its financial capability to manage the cost saving.

To solve the problems, the government provides solutions, one of them\nis by forming a microfinance program, namely Rural Agribusiness Business Development\n(PUAP). PUAP program is one of the grant activities to farmer group association (Gapoktan)\nwith a total capital assistance of IDR 100 million. The problem with the 52,186 Gapoktan\nunits that participated in PUAP activities, only 7,703 units (15%) were transformed into Agri-\nbusiness Microfinance Institutions (LKMA). This paper differs from others as it briefly\nexplains the PUAP/MFI\u2019s institutional transformation and the factors that affect its sustain-\nability, which is so far still limited discussed. The paper aims to see what transformations\nGapoktan becomes an inclusive LKMA and the level of sustainability of the LKMA. The\nresearch was conducted in Kendal Regency, Central Java- Indonesia, in 2022 on 5 LKMA.\nThe process of transforming LKMA into an inclusive financial institution is analyzed descrip-\ntively. LKMA sustainability levels were analyzed using a multidimensional scaling (MDS)\napproach with the Rapfish application. So far, MDS with the Rapfish application is still very\nlimited for microfinance analysis. MDS analysis is employed because it is relatively simple\nand effective for looking at sensitive attributes in improving sustainability and generating\nleverage attributes that can be used for policy-making. The result study shows that the\ntransformation of PUAP into LKMA is driven by the ability to improve legality, financial gover-\nnance and diversify the customer\u2019s business field. The five LKMAs have a sustainability sta-\ntus of \u2019sufficient\u2019 in running their business, with an index value of more than 50%. The study\nrecommends 1) the Indonesian government could assist LKMA in improving its legality and\n2) LKMA\u2019s management should get training by experts to improve its financial capability to\nmanage the cost saving.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 1 / 20\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Darwis V, Rachmawati RR, Muslim C, Chanifah , Sembiring A, Ilham N, et al.

The ease of agricultural lending methods in rural areas can improve access to credit [1], the financial performance of smallholders [2], and farmers\u2019 income [3, 4] due to increased productivity [5]. However, the fact is that farmers and poor rural people in developing countries face many obstacles in accessing formal financial institutions [6, 7]. This lack of access is due to the lack of information about the agricultural sector in formal financial institutions [8], banks\u2019 orientation is the most significant profit, and not all banks have a network of branch offices in the countryside [9, 10]. The condition causes farmers to choose to borrow money from informal institutions [11] such as credit associations, private loan sharks, relatives [12], traders of production facilities [13] and credit cooperatives [9]. The problem is that loan interest in informal financial institutions is higher than in formal financial institutions [10]. Efforts are needed to overcome the problem by forming inclusive financial institutions to ease farmers\u2019 and community members\u2019 accessing and using financial services [14].\nInclusive financial institutions have been implemented in several developing countries but\nface various obstacles. In Vietnam, for example [15], rural credit cannot increase farmers\u2019 incomes, and the positive impact is felt only by wealthy households that receive more significant credit. In Pakistan, farmers\u2019 credit cannot increase the gross domestic product of agriculture [16]. Meanwhile, in India, there is a tendency to deviate from the mission of financial institutions with indications of dependence on profits and the growing involvement of significant corporate roles [17].\nBased on Government accounting technical standard bulletin number 13 concerning grant accounting, a meaning of grant spending is a government spending in the form of cash/goods/ service, that could be given to other governments, international organisation, central/local government, state own company, community group, or community organisation that spesifically has been set the use, not compulsory nor binding, also is not continuesly except determined differently in the legislative regulation.\nThe national team of poverty countermeasures acceleration presented that some govern-\nment empowerment programs provide grants to community organizations. The grant is expected rolling hence it could use continuously. One of the empowerment programs is the national community empowerment program- called PNPMMandiri. PNPM Mandiri\u2019s program aims to create sustainable poverty alleviation and job creation in rural areas.\nOne activity of the PNPMMandiri program in agricultural sector is Rural Agribusiness Development (PUAP). PUAP activities are business capital assistance to each farmer group association (Gapoktan) in one village. Each Gapoktan is expected to form a good LKMA, which can drive sustainable financial performance [2].\nThe PUAP activities were carried out from 2008 to 2015 in 52,186 Gapoktan. In its implementation, it is expected that each Gapoktan will form LKMA. The LKMA will manage the savings and loans of its members by following the agreed regulations. However, until now, not all Gapoktan make up LKMA. According to the Directorate of financing of the Ministry of Agriculture, the number of LKMA has formed until 2022 is only 7,703 unit (15%).\nThe low formation of LKMA is because: (1) establishing institutions is quite complex, and\nit takes time [18] (ii) the capacity of the management has not been able to manage the turnover of funds, (iii) some farmers are still late and do not return the loan funds because they are considered PUAP as the grants from the government, and (iv) the use of funds for consumptive activities [19\u201321] (and absence of clear instructions on the continuation of the revolving fund program of the PUAP program [22].

Kendal was chosen because it is one of the districts participating in PUAP activities. The content of the paper is different from others as others are more focused on the impact of lending on the increase of production, sales, assets and profits; relationships between farmers and banks in some countries regarding credit approval and demographic and economic factors affecting access to credit [24, 30\u201333]. The paper briefly explains PUAP\u2019s activities, research locations, PUAP institutional transformation, especially in legality, institutional governance and credit, and the levels and factors that affect its sustainability."

Each\nGapoktan is expected to form a microfinance institution because it is engaged in agriculture. The name of the institution is the Agribusiness Microfinance Institution (LKMA). The establishment of LKMA is intended to: (1) provide certainty of services and ease of access for farmers to financing facilities; (2) provide simple and fast procedures; (3) the proximity of the service location to the farmer\u2019s place of business; and (4) LKMA managers fully understand the character of farmers as customers. Later, LKMA is expected to be one of the sources for farmers or rural communities in borrowing business capital [34, 35].\nThe main task of LKMA is to manage assistance from the government in loans for LKMA\nmembers. The lending process starts with the farmer member filling out the Member Business Plan (MBP) form and submitting it to the farmer group. Farmer groups followed the MBP as a Group Business Plan (GBP). The GBP was then handed over to Gapoktan. After that, Gapoktan will issue a Joint Business Plan (JBP). This JBP is used as a loan legality by Gapoktan."

The 2019 research focused on the supervision and assistance of LKMA management to meet the capital increase requirements of GIC. Meanwhile, research in 2022 looked at what transformations have been carried out by LKMA and what factors affect the sustainability of LKMA.\nThe level of sustainability of LKMA is analyzed on a multi-attribute basis from various eco-\nnomic, social, environmental, institutional and technological dimensions. The large number of attributes used as indicators makes the analysis process quite challenging to carry out. The right approach to use is Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). MDS is chosen to make large amounts of data or highly complex multivariate data more accessible to interpret [36]. MDS is quantitative-qualitative descriptive research in which a qualitative approach is used to determine the situation and conditions of the existing location through interviews, while the quantitative approach is used to assess sustainability from various aspects of dimensions and what aspects affect the sustainability [37].\nThe Multi Dimension Scaling (MDS) method has been widely used to observe the sustain-\nability of a business in Indonesia [37\u201345]. However, the MDS method is rarely used to measure the sustainability of LKMA. Studies in other countries regarding the LKMA\u2019s sustainability mostly use an accounting approach (financial performance) [46\u201348] and some use an institutional approach [49]. The novelty of this study is to analyze the sustainability of LKMA using MDS with the Rapfish application. This method is relatively simple, but the results shown by sensitive attributes can be used by policymakers to improve the sustainability of MFAs.\nThe MDS analysis tool in this study used the Rapfish 3.1 (Rapid Appraisal for Fisheries)\napplication. The stages of MDS analysis with the Rapfish application include: i) determining attributes, indicators and scoring, ii) determining \"good\" and \"bad\" scores and then applying them to Rapfish, iii) multi-dimensional coordination for each attribute iv) sustainability level analysis, v) attribute leverage analysis and vi) model accuracy and conformity analysis (Value of stress, R-squared and Monte Carlo) [50, 51] a distance matrix technique in MDS based on Euclidean distances with the formula:\nd1;2 \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi X1 X2\u00f0 \u00de 2 \u00fe Y1 Y2\u00f0 \u00de 2 \u00fe Z1 Z2\u00f0 \u00de 2 \u00fe . . . q\n\u00f01\u00de\nNote:\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 4 / 20\nd1,2 = euclidean distance X, Y, Z = Atribute 1,2 = observation The distance matrix is so crucial in MDS [52]; therefore, the distance between two points\n(d1,2) is projected in two-dimensional Euclidean distances with the following regression equation\nd12 \u00bc a\u00fe bD12 \u00fe e \u00f02\u00de\nZuhdi [37] states that Rapfish applies the ALSCAL algorithm, which serves as an iteration until it gets a bit error value, as a result of which the intercept value on the equation becomes zero (a = 0) and the equation changes to:\nd12 \u00bc bD12 \u00fe e\nThe iteration process will stop when the voltage value is less than 0.25.

Furthermore, in the transformation, two things need to be considered. First, transformation is a process; it cannot be done in a hurry, nor should it be done too late. The transformation must be carefully planned and implemented in earnest. Secondly, transformation is a contribution and will not succeed without the contribution of the smallest unit that wants to transform.\nAccording to Saptana [54], factors that need to be transformed in LKMA include legal\nentity status, organisational structure, organisational goals or orientation, division of tasks or roles, coordination and communication systems, types of business activities, business management, sources of science and technology, business intensity, human resources skills, and the final product resulting. In line with Saptana\u2019s opinion, the institutional transformation seen in the PUAP program into an inclusive institution were: changes in legal ownership, changes in organisation and the development of ownership of assets, members and business capital.\nThere are three stages of the process of transforming Gapoktan into LKMA, first, the trans-\nformation of LKMA began when the Gapoktan was formed at the start of the program (2008\u2013 2015); second, LKMA under the supervision of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) (2015\u2013 2018) and third, LKMA under the supervision of the Government Investment Center (GIC) (2019\u20132022). As the next step in financial development, the transformation process needs to go hand in hand with socioeconomic development, with an increase in living standards.

The transformation of legality types in the five LKMAs surveyed has increased, starting at the time of the program to obtaining capital loans from GIC (Table 2). The types of legality required by LKMA under the supervision of Gapoktan are: (i) Memorandum of Association/ Articles of Association (AD/ART), as guidelines or rules in running the organization (ii) Decree of the Village Head, as an acknowledgment of the existence of Gapoktan in the village, (iii) and Decree of the Minister of Agriculture regarding the participation of Gapoktan in PUAP activities.\nLKMA is in charge of managing finances and providing loans to the public; therefore, it is\ncoached under the guidance of the FSA. Several legalities that need to be completed by the LKMA management under FSA supervision are a deed establishment issued by a notary, institutional endorsement from the Ministry of Cooperatives, Taxpayer Identification Number and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) in running their business. Some types of SOPs used include SOPs for lending, SOPs for receiving and closing deposits, SOPs for collection to borrowers, and SOPs for resolving bad debts.\nRegulators and supervisors must distinguish between the LKMA of the deposit recipient,\nwhose financial health needs to verify through prudential supervision, and the categories of LKMA that may be registered and subject to non-prudential regulations and standards (e.g. audit reports, consumer information) but do not pose a financial system risk for which the financial authority is responsible [57].\nLKMA that gets additional loans from the GIC must complete several other requirements,\nsuch as environmental licenses, a cooperative and business registration number, and social health Insurance. Once they are fulfilled, a Letter of Approval for Financing Principles is made\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 7 / 20\nbetween the manager of LKMA and GIC. In managing all these legality letters, the LKMA management gets assistance from the Directorate Financing of the Ministry of Agriculture, the economic section of the provincial government and the agricultural office district. Not all LKMAs administrators can meet GIC requirements regarding many types of legality needed. One of them, for example, is the administrator of LKMA Sindang Mulyo. As a result, LKMA Sindang Mulyo did not get additional business capital loans from GIC."

Transparency can be represented in the Annual Member Meeting.\nGovernance in LKMA institutions is more focused on: (i) the governance of LKMA institu-\ntions and (ii) the governance of loan implementation. Institutional governance when LKMA was under Gapoktan, the management was not distinguished (Table 3). The reason is that no members are willing to become special administrators of LKMA. Under the supervision of FSA, the management of LKMA is entirely handed over to the manager. It applied to 4 LKMA, or 80% of samples. The secretary and treasurer assist them. The management is growing by adding special information technology (IT) personnel after getting a loan from GIC as it requested LKMA to send borrower requirements and the financial statements report monthly via the internet.\nLKMA administrators will be elected at the time of the annual meeting. The length of the\nmanagement period varies by group. There is one LKMA (20%) for two, three, and five years of management periods found in each of the two LKMAs.

For supervision to be effective, the data requirements and indicators must be adapted to the operations of the LKMA, and they must adapt their information systems to the reporting requirements of the central bank. Given that LKMA\u2019s loan portfolio is short-term, stricter standards in certain areas, such as portfolio quality and provision, and more frequent monitoring may be required [58].\nBecoming a member of LKMA is not difficult, only paying the principal deposit once and\nmandatory deposits every month. Apart from being a requirement to become a member, these deposits are also used as additional capital. In general, members\u2019 consideration to choose LKMA is influenced by education level, land area, agricultural income, household expenditure, distance from the service provision centre, and perception of interest rates [57]. The difference is about the domicile of members. Previously, it should be from one village. Today, the members\u2019 domicile can be outside the village but should be still in the one sub-district."

The change was seen from the borrowers, who used to have to be members of Gapoktan. Wulandari [59] stated that membership is an essential prerequisite to accessing farmer associations\u2019 finance. Nowadays, the general community can also make loans for those who live within and outside the village in one subdistrict (Table 4). The loan allocation has also changed. Initially, loans were provided for the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 9 / 20\nagricultural sector. Nevertheless, loans at currently allocated to agricultural and non-agricultural sector businesses.\nCollateral becomes a requirement that is difficult for borrowers to meet farmers mainly\nborrow funds from LKMA because of the absence of collateral requirements. Collateral is a dominant factor that encourages farmers to access loans [60]. Loosening collateral requirements in lending funds can increase the number of borrowers from farmers [61]. LKMA is the only formal financial institution that can lend money to farmers and is a tool to eradicate poverty [62]. Therefore, collateral was not compulsory when LKMA joined the Gapoktan management. Borrowers only need to make a multilevel application, starting from the Member Business Plan letter given to the farmer group management. Afterwards, the farmer management made a Group Business Plan and submitted it to Gapoktan. The Gapoktan issued a Joint Business Plan containing the amount and timing of the loan and the purpose of using the loan. Under the supervision of the FSA and GIC, the loan application changes with the application for each loan by completing an identity card, filling out a loan contract and being accompanied by collateral such as a land certificate, houses or certificate ownership of motor vehicles.\nAt the beginning of the PUAP implementation, the highest loan given was only 5,000,000\nIDR. The amount was relatively low as LKMA had limited capital [63]. With the capital increasing capital and getting a loan from GIC, LKMA can increase the loan up to 15,000,000, and the latest is 30,000,000 IDR. Initially, the implementation, the loan interest rate averaged 1.85% per month. After that, it rises to 2% per month. Besides interest, borrowers are also charged an administrative fee\u2014initially, 2.2% of the total loan to 3%. In term number of borrowers, there is also a significantly changed. The number of them under the supervision of the FSA increased compared to under the Gapoktan management, from 778 borrowers to 972, and escalated to 1,603 borrowers after becoming GIC customers. The rise in the number of borrowers, loan interest, and administrative costs improved LKMA\u2019s capital from an average of IDR 205,800,000 in 2015 (LKMA management was the same as the Gapoktan) to IDR 700,200,000 in 2021 (after obtaining a loan from GIC). The findings show that changes in governance have a positive effect on increasing LKMA\u2019s capital.\nAfter LKMA gets a loan from GIC, it has two sources of loan funding, LKMA capital and GIC. GIC loans are known as Ultra Microloans. The steps to submit the GIC loan are as follows: fill in the loan form LKMA has prepared. Then the form is sent to GIC via the internet. GIC will check whether the borrower has a loan from another financial institution. If there is\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 10 / 20\nnone, the loan can be disbursed by LKMA after getting GIC approval.

Incorporating sustainability in microfinance business activities through strategic management\ncan generate competitive advantages, have an impact on positive finances, and financial stability to find new sources of financing and service development [66, 67].\nBased on the sustainability index, the rank of five LKMAs based on rank 1 (the highest) to rank 5 (the lowest) are as follows; rank 1 was Anugerah Tani Makmur with an index of 72.74, rank 2 by Mojo Agung Sejahtera with an index of 63.63, rank 3 by Blorok Makmur Sejahtera with an index of 62.43, rank 4 by Taman Sari with an index of 60.88, and rank 5 by Sendang Mulyo with an index of 55.20.\nThe Performance position and sustainability status of the five LKMAs are shown on the\nrapfish ordination graph (Fig 2). At the centre of the chart is an \"o\" (round) sign indicating the fifth position of the LKMA. The fifth position of LKMA is in the index range of 50\u201370. The more significant index value or the object\u2019s position getting to the right indicates a higher sustainability status. Meaning that Anugerah Tani Makmur is at the highest level of sustainability, while LKMA Sendang Mulyo is at the lowest level.\nTwo LKMA positions are close together, namely LKMA Mojo Agung Sejahtera and Blorok\nMakmur Sejahtera, while the other 3 LKMAs have positions far apart. The proximity of positions between objects indicates that objects have similarities, while positions far apart indicate that objects have differences.\nBased on the sustainability index value, LKMA Anugerah Tani Makmur ranks first. LKMA\nAnugerah Tani Makmur is superior to other LKMAs, especially on the attributes of i) clarity and fairness legality of LKMA cooperatives formally, ii) types of businesses financed are more varied, including food crops, plantation, horticultural, animal husbandry, marketing, and processing of products with a fairly low-interest rate, which is 1.5%, iii) the implementation of the cooperative business, especially the determination of the loan amount is high enough, reach 30,000,000, IDR, the application of collateral, awards, professional sanctions and annual meeting member, iv) a trend of increasing the number of cooperative members from 2013\u20132021 was positive and kept increasing, v) Professional organizational structure and high position incentives, and vi) The ownership of assets in the form of land while other LKMAs do not have it. Previous research showed that the sustainability of MFI is influenced by the superiority of institutional characteristics and attributes [68].\nLegality is one of the factors supporting the sustainability of LKMA [69], as to apply for\nfunding from outside parties such as GIC and banks, the clear legality of LKMA will be questioned. Meanwhile, LKMA finances various types of businesses to avoid the risk of bad debts. If one of the business fields loses, the other business fields are expected to provide benefits, especially if the type of business financing is the agricultural sector. The agricultural business is risky because it is related to external factors that humans cannot control, such as weather, disease attacks and uncertain commodity prices [70, 71].\nLKMA Sendang Mulyo is in the last ranking position. The average performance of LKMA Sendang Mulyo attributes below that of 4 other LKMA. Attributes with lower performance in\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 12 / 20\nLKMA Sendang Mulyo include i) legality, ii) business implementation, iii) other costs other than interest, iv) organization and incentives, and v) cooperative assets.\nLeverage of attributes analysis. The attributes that affect the sustainability of LKMA are shown in the Leverage of Attributes Chart (Fig 3). Attributes that most influence the sustainability level of the five LKMAs are: i) Attributes of the average development of the number of members, ii) other costs except an interest, iii) the average development of income, iv) spending, and v) legality.\nThe number of financial institutions or cooperative members is significant for the institu-\ntion\u2019s progress. Therefore, a development number of members becomes the first attribute that affects the sustainability of an LK MA. Increasing LKMA members will increase mandatory, principal, and voluntary deposits. In addition, it also increases the value of LKMA\u2019s accounts receivable, increasing the turnover of capital from loan interest proceeds. [72] Deposit mobilization is a scheme intended to encourage customers to deposit more cash into LKMA so that the money can be used to disburse more loans and generate additional income. Increasing the number of cooperative members must be carried out to improve the sustainability status of LKMA.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 13 / 20\nOther costs, except interest, are the second influences attributed to improving the LKMA\nsustainability index. The costs consist of i) administrative costs and ii) the presence or absence of cases of late instalment payments. Too high and wasteful administrative costs will affect financial performance and capital availability. The efficiency of administrative costs improves the sustainability status of LKMA because it is more efficient and increases capital. Prominent cases of late instalments from members will reduce capital turnover and LKMA\u2019s performance. Improving the sustainability status of LKMA could be done by minimizing instalment delays from members. Members who have income from various sources of business can mostly pay instalments on time 64. [63] stated that the efficiency of administrative costs improves the sustainability status of LKMA because it is more efficient and increases capital.\nThe third attribute that affects the sustainability of LKMA is the development of sources of\nincome. An increase in the source of income from the addition of mandatory, principal, voluntary deposits and interest on loans will increase capital. LKMA management needs to be creative in increasing income from various sources, such as diversifying loan services to expand cooperative businesses. [73] stated that the provision of loans can increase the dividend, capital, labour and the market affect the income of Small and Medium Enterprise players [72]. The efficiency of LKMA staff members influences LKMA\u2019s sustainability in managing borrowers and its ability to use assets to generate income [74]. The higher the source of income of LKMA, the more capital increases. The capital increase will improve the sustainability status of LKMA.\nThe fourth attribute that affects the sustainability of LKMA is expenditure. [75] microfi-\nnance institutions have the challenge of reducing operating costs by minimizing operating costs, declining total expenses, and increasing revenue. Cooperative expenses include\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 14 / 20\noperational costs, management services, office stationary costs, devidend, and annual member meeting costs. The efficiency of cooperative expenses is the primary key to cost savings, especially operational and office stationary costs. Meanwhile, the cost of managing services, dividend, and annual member meeting are hard to be saved because it is already suitable with the number of members.\nThe fifth attribute that affects the sustainability of LKMA is legality. Legality is the key to\nincreasing members\u2019 loyalty, even to increasing the number of members. Formal legality clarity of LKMA will increase the number of members and the level of loyalty. For credit institutions in agriculture, farmers need a solid legal framework and dynamic agricultural development policies to develop microfinance Clarity of legality is one of the factors supporting the sustainability of LKMA [69] to apply for funding from outside parties such as GIC and banks."

A good model is shown with an S-Stress value smaller than 0.25 and an RSQ close to 1. When viewed from the results of Stress and RSQ values, it can be said that the results of the MDS analysis at the sustainability level of five LKMAs in Kendal Regency can represent actual conditions at the LKMA level.\nThe difference in results between the MDS index and the Montecarlo index reflects the sus-\ntainability status. Monte Carlo is used to determining the accuracy of the results. If the difference between MDS and Monte Carlo is<1, then the sustainability index is above 95 per cent. The difference value of<1 indicates that the value of the sustainability index status at the interval confidence according to the RSQ value obtained results that did not have much difference (https://agungbudisantoso.com/multidimensional-scaling-part-4/). The result of the difference between the MDS index and the Monte Carlo index is shown in Table 7.\nThe five LKMAs showed the difference between MDS and Monte Carlo<1, meaning that\nthey have certainty or sustainability to be developed into a better or more professional LKMA so that their sustainability status increases. The small value of the sustainability index between MDS and Monte Carlo indicates that (1) errors in scoring each attribute are relatively small, (2) the variety of scoring each attribute is relatively small, (3) the repeated analysis process is stable, and (4) errors in the inclusion of missing data can be avoided."

            "text": "Five LKMAs that received business capital loans from the Government Investment Center of the Ministry of Finance in Kendal Regency are moderately sustainable and can be continued. It is shown from the MDS index result is more than 50. Meanwhile, attributes that could affect the sustainability of the five microfinances are i) the increasing lender number, ii) the increase in other costs besides interest at the time of borrowing, and iii) the development type of microfinance institutions source of income, (iv) MFI expenditure, and (v) legality. MFI management could maintain and improve sustainability by ameliorating financial performance. It can be done by increasing efficiency through cost savings and the amount of capital supported by strengthening aspects of MFI legality.\nThe Agribusiness Microcredit Institution, formed through government grants, can slowly transform into an inclusive institution providing business capital loans for the communities\u2019 economy. The transformation of the institution through the process of learning and escort in its implementation. The most critical processes include: (i) completing legality requirements as a financial institution, (ii) clear and transparent governance represented from financial\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286482 June 23, 2023 15 / 20\nstatements, (iii) knowing and utilizing information technology in operationalizing work and (iv) escorting and assisting continuously, both from the central and local governments, especially in completing administrative requirements, management training and financial reporting regularly. We recommend that the Indonesian government could assist LKMA in improving its legality and LKMA\u2019s management should get training by experts to improve its financial capability to manage the cost saving.\nThe limitation of this study is that the study was only conducted in Kendal Regency, Central\nJava, Indonesia, while spatial resource conditions vary between districts. The PUAP program is implemented almost in all districts in Indonesia. Therefore, similar studies are needed in other regions to confirm the results of this study so that it can be applied more generally both in Indonesia and other countries."
