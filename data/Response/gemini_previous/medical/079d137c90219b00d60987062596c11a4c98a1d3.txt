1. **Investigate the role of lactic acidosis in the development of cancer stem cells:** Lactic acidosis has been shown to promote the survival and proliferation of cancer cells, and it is possible that it may also play a role in the development of cancer stem cells, which are a small population of cells that are resistant to therapy and can give rise to new tumors.


2. **Explore the use of lactic acidosis as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis:** Lactic acidosis is a common feature of many types of cancer, and it is possible that it could be used as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. By measuring the levels of lactic acid in the blood or other bodily fluids, it may be possible to detect cancer early or to determine the aggressiveness of a tumor.


3. **Develop new therapeutic strategies that target lactic acidosis in cancer:** The findings of this paper suggest that lactic acidosis is a potential target for cancer therapy. By developing drugs that inhibit the production of lactic acid or that block the effects of lactic acidosis, it may be possible to kill cancer cells or to prevent them from spreading.


4. **Investigate the role of lactic acidosis in the development of resistance to cancer therapy:** Lactic acidosis has been shown to promote the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. By understanding the mechanisms by which lactic acidosis contributes to resistance, it may be possible to develop new strategies to overcome resistance and improve the effectiveness of cancer therapy.


5. **Explore the use of lactic acidosis as a target for immunotherapy:** Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. Lactic acidosis has been shown to suppress the immune system, and it is possible that it may be a target for immunotherapy. By developing drugs that block the effects of lactic acidosis on the immune system, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy.
