 Here are 5 potential future research directions based on the paper:

1. Investigate more advanced techniques for fusing grouped features after G-Conv, such as attention mechanisms or graph neural networks, to further enhance inter-group information flow and feature learning. 

2. Explore automated neural architecture search methods to find optimal GFAC-1DCNN architectures for specific tasks and datasets, removing the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

3. Apply GFAC-1DCNN to other radar signature recognition tasks beyond HRRP, such as SAR and ISAR, to validate generalization capabilities.

4. Develop robustness techniques like adversarial training to improve GFAC-1DCNN's resilience against spoofed or manipulated radar signatures of targets. 

5. Investigate model compression techniques like knowledge distillation to further reduce GFAC-1DCNN's complexity for embedded deployment on missile defense platforms with limited compute resources.
