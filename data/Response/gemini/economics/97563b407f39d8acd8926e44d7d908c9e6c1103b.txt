1. **Investigate the genetic basis of STEM occupations in different countries and cultures.** The current study focused on the UK population, but it would be interesting to see if the same genetic variants are associated with STEM occupations in other countries and cultures. This would help to determine whether the genetic basis of STEM occupations is universal or if it varies across populations.


2. **Examine the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and other measures of cognitive ability and personality.** The current study found that STEM polygenic scores were positively correlated with educational attainment, cognitive ability, and intelligence. However, it is unclear whether these correlations are due to the fact that STEM occupations require these skills or if there is a causal relationship between these traits and STEM occupations. Future studies could investigate this relationship in more detail by examining the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and other measures of cognitive ability and personality, such as creativity, risk-taking, and perseverance.


3. **Explore the role of gene-environment interactions in STEM occupations.** The current study focused on the genetic basis of STEM occupations, but it is likely that gene-environment interactions also play a role. For example, individuals with certain genetic variants may be more likely to pursue a STEM career if they are exposed to certain environmental factors, such as having parents who are STEM professionals or attending a school with a strong STEM program. Future studies could investigate the role of gene-environment interactions in STEM occupations by examining the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and STEM occupations in different environments.


4. **Investigate the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and other life outcomes.** The current study focused on the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and socioeconomic outcomes, such as educational attainment and household income. However, it is possible that STEM polygenic scores are also associated with other life outcomes, such as health, well-being, and longevity. Future studies could investigate the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and these other life outcomes.


5. **Develop interventions to promote STEM education and careers for individuals with high STEM polygenic scores.** The current study found that individuals with high STEM polygenic scores are more likely to pursue STEM careers. This suggests that it may be possible to develop interventions to promote STEM education and careers for these individuals. For example, interventions could focus on providing these individuals with information about STEM careers, connecting them with STEM mentors, and providing them with financial assistance to pursue STEM education.
