    "abstractText": "Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) has a high death rate with 500,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths occurring annually. Despite the development of novel strategies and technologies, there is no adequate treatment for the disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find structural analogs of natural products as potential novel drugs to treat VL. To choose structural analogs from natural products that have demonstrated anti-leishmanial and anti-adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) properties, and that might bind with several targets from the purine salvage pathway, we used computer-aided drug design (CADD) techniques. Computational techniques were used to study the purine salvage pathway from Leishmania infantum, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to gather information on the interactions between ligands and proteins. An analog of the alkaloid Skimmianine, N,N-diethyl-4-methoxy-1-benzofuran-6-carboxamide, demonstrated a good binding affinity to two L. infantum targets, no expected toxicity, and potential for oral route administration. This study indicates that the compounds may have anti-leishmanial activity, which granted in vitro and in vivo experiments to settle this finding in the future.",

Despite the development of novel strategies and technologies, there is no adequate treatment for the disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find structural analogs of natural products as potential novel drugs to treat VL. To choose structural analogs from natural products that have demonstrated anti-leishmanial and anti-adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) properties, and that might bind with several targets from the purine salvage pathway, we used computer-aided drug design (CADD) techniques. Computational techniques were used to study the purine salvage pathway from Leishmania infantum, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to gather information on the interactions between ligands and proteins. An analog of the alkaloid Skimmianine, N,N-diethyl-4-methoxy-1-benzofuran-6-carboxamide, demonstrated a good binding affinity to two L. infantum targets, no expected toxicity, and potential for oral route administration. This study indicates that the compounds may have anti-leishmanial activity, which granted in vitro and in vivo experiments to settle this finding in the future.\nKeywords: Drug Discovery; Natural Products; Skimmianine; Visceral Leishmaniasis; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Virtual Screening."

            "text": "Computer-aided drug design (CADD) is a cutting-edge computational approach used in the drug development process, which is becoming embraced in both academic and pharmaceutical spheres [1]. CADD has been used to identify leads from chemical or natural compounds, and involves approaches like computational biology and chemistry, molecular modeling, and virtual screening [2], and has the potential to speed up the drug design process and cut costs by several billion dollars [3]. This approach shows particular potential for generating drugs to treat neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), a class of infectious diseases with high endemicity in developing nations that are deemed \"neglected\" when there aren't any reliable, inexpensive, or simple-to-apply pharmacological treatments available [4].\nVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the NTDs and ranks second and seventh among them in terms of mortality and loss of disability-adjusted life years, respectively [5,6]. VL is a vector-borne disease that can be fatal if untreated and is brought on by an intracellular protozoon of the genus Leishmania. The disease is caused by Leishmania donovani in Asia and Eastern Africa and Leishmania infantum in Latin America and the Mediterranean region [7]. With an estimated 200 million people at risk, VL is widespread in over 70 countries. However, seven nations\u2014namely, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan\u2014report more than 90% of all recorded cases of VL globally [8].\nThe only drugs authorized for the treatment of VL are pentavalent antimonials drugs, such as sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate, paromomycin, miltefosine, and amphotericin B [9]. However, these drugs are toxic to the liver, kidneys, and spleen and are still difficult to administer to patients [10]. Because of these factors, the search for novel treatments has recently been quite active, and a wide range of compounds have been discovered, yet few new drug candidates reached clinical trials in the last decades [11]. Recent anti-leishmanial drug research has concentrated on natural products (NPs), and their potential [12\u201317], as there are 20 antiparasitic drugs derived from NPs in the total number of drugs introduced to the market over the past 40 years, which represents a significant source of new antiparasitic pharmacological entities [18].

The first criterion is to identify a plausible target that is either missing from the host or physically and/or functionally distinct from the host homolog while finding targets that are important for the parasite's survival is the second one [19]. Additionally, single drugs that can function on several molecular targets are becoming more popular, and this appears like a viable strategy for treating complex disorders, such as VL [20]. By understanding the pathogen's biological pathways\u2014which requires knowledge of the underlying kinetics driving the enzymes and chemicals involved in the system\u2014CADD approaches can be utilized, in this manner, to uncover new potential targets and drugs [21,22].\nAs Leishmania cannot synthesize purines and is dependent on the host for their purine needs, the purine salvage pathway (PSP) has attracted research regarding the development of anti-leishmanial therapeutics [23]. The major enzymes of the pathway are phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTs), which convert dephosphorylated purines into the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates. Adenine-phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), and xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT) are the three PRTs that Leishmania expresses [24]. Recently APRT has been used in molecular screening investigations against datasets of NPs obtained from actinomycetes [25], secondary metabolites from plants [26], and literature [27] for potential inhibitors. Likewise, a valuable treatment for canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is allopurinol, a purine analog that is phosphorylated by HGPRT and incorporated into nucleic acids, killing the parasite [28]; emphasizing the potential of PSP for drug discovery against Leishmania. However, as Leishmania contains several complementary purine salvage pathways, it has been suggested that PRTs are not essential for the parasite's survival. Consequently, developing an anti-leishmanial treatment based on PSP requires focusing on multiple enzymes at once [29].\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To uncover compounds that can interact with various PSP targets, structural analogs of NPs that have demonstrated anti-leishmanial and anti-APRT properties were put through virtual screening. Also, the PSP from L. infantum was studied using computational methods, and data on interactions between ligands and proteins was obtained by molecular dynamic simulations."

The molecular networks were retrieved from the STRING database (https://string-db.org) [34], and sent to the Cytoscape platform [35], where the plugin cytoHubba was used to score and rank the nodes according to network properties, affording to the Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) topological analysis method [36].

Furthermore, the eleven sequences of the purine salvage pathway were also subjected to a BLASTp analysis of sequence homology toward human proteins, and the results revealed that 44 human proteins shared varying degrees of homology with the targets of L. infantum. Adenylosuccinate lyase protein (ID: A4HS40) and APRT (ID: A4I1V1) were the only targets with homology scores that fell below the predetermined cut-off values for homology (Figure 1C).\nData collection and virtual screening\nA search for NPs with anti-leishmanial and anti-APRT activities was conducted in the NuBBEDB, and the results included 33 NPs with anti-leishmanial activity, 10 of which have also been identified as APRT activity inhibitors. Two of the NPs described\u2014namely Skimmianine (NuBBE_599) and Isopimpinellin (NuBBE_1280)\u2014were isolated from Adiscanthus fusciorus species [64], while 8 NPs\u2014namely 2\u03b1,3\u03b1-dihydroxyolean-12- en28-oic acid (NuBBE_1203), 2\u03b1,3\u03b1,19\u03b1- trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (NuBBE_1204), Chrysoeriol (NuBBE_1205), Acacetin (NuBBE_1206), 3-O-methylquercetin (NuBBE_1223), 3,3-O-dimethylquercetin (NuBBE_1224), 3,7,4-O-trimethylkaempferol (NuBBE_1225), and Penduletin 4-O-methyl ether (NuBBE_1226)\u2014were isolated from Vitex polygama Cham species [65].\nA search on the SwissSimilarity server using the commercial zinc-drug-like compound library was conducted to find structural analogs to the eight NPs chosen.

Seven of the identified compounds exhibited the ability to bind to multiple targets in the virtual screening analysis against the eleven purine salvage pathway proteins, which are presented in Figure 2D. While, when clustering the compounds by the Tanimoto similarity score, five of them\u2014namely 5,6,7- trimethoxy-1H-indole-2-carboxamide (PubChem CID: 4777887), 3-[Butyl(methyl)amino]4-hydroxychromen-2-one (PubChem CID: 54733114), N-(2-methoxyethyl)-2-(7-methoxy1H-indol-1-yl)acetamide (PubChem CID: 39315359), N,N-diethyl-4-methoxy-1benzofuran-6-carboxamide (PubChem CID: 71688722), and 4-ethoxy-N,N-diethyl-1benzofuran-6-carboxamide (PubChem CID: 71688752)\u2014were considered unique compounds (Figure 2E).\nRMSD, RG, and SASA calculations from molecular dynamics simulation\nFigure 3 shows the configuration of eleven L. infantum targets; where the conformation is shown in 3D and a label that identifies each target. Likewise, Figure 4 shows the top five compounds discovered by virtual screening. The study of the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), which provided an average value for the conformational changes the protein underwent during the simulation time, was used to calculate the deviation of each spatial coordinate of the protein during that time. The radius of gyration (RG), which specifies how the cross-sectional area or mass distribution is spread around its central axis, was also assessed. When the RG is calculated using an advanced computational technique, the compactness of a protein is directly related to the rate at which it folds. The structure is the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). When a protein is under external stress, such as when it binds to a foreign material (a drug), it undergoes conformational changes that make hydrophobic residues more soluble in water and other solvents. Table S1 shows the average RMSD, RG, and SASA values. Also, the supplementary material (Figures S1 to S11) presents the different diagrams for each analyzed target.\nIn the case of APRT, we observed that the binding to four of the five compounds stabilized the structure with an average RMSD lower than that of the APRT without ligand, while 3- [Butyl(methyl)amino]-4-hydroxychromen-2-one was the only compound that changes the structure of APRT with an average RMSD value of 0.34 nm. Also, the average RG value for APRT with 5,6,7-trimethoxy-1H-indole-2-carboxamide, N,N-diethyl-4-methoxy-1-\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The N-(2-methoxyethyl)-2-(7-methoxy-1H-indol-1-yl) acetamide and 3-[Butyl(methyl)amino]-4-hydroxychromen-2-one compounds obtained a higher RG value, which indicates a lower compaction of the APRT structure. Compared to the other compounds, the average SASA value of APRT/3-[Butyl(methyl)amino]-4hydroxychromen-2-one was high.\nADL/3-[Butyl(methyl)amino]-4-hydroxychromen-2-one complex presented the highest average RMSD value, while 5,6,7-trimethoxy-1H-indole-2-carboxamide was the one that improved the structural stability of ADL. The average value of the compaction analyzed with the RG shows us that the N,N-diethyl-4-methoxy-1-benzofuran-6-carboxamide compound improves the compaction of ADL and the 3-[Butyl(methyl)amino]-4hydroxychromen-2-one and 4-ethoxy-N,N-diethyl-1-benzofuran-6-carboxamide compounds reduce the compaction of ADL. At the same time, the average value of SASA shows us that 5,6,7-trimethoxy-1H-indole-2-carboxamide was the lowest value for 3- [Butyl(methyl)amino]-4-hydroxychromen-2-one. Therefore, ADL is altered by 3- [Butyl(methyl)amino]-4-hydroxychromen-2-one binding.\nAnalysis of protein-ligand binding affinities with MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA\nWith the use of continuum solvation implicit models and the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) and Molecular Mechanics GeneralizedBorn Surface Area (MM/GBSA) techniques, the binding free energy (\u0394G) may be estimated. By examining several conformations acquired from the last 100 frames of the MD simulations, the \u0394G of these data was ascertained. Based on the results in Tables S2 and S3, we noted that our work's MM/PBSA technique might have done better than MM/GBSA. This could be explained by the MM/PBSA model being more sensitive to the selection of parameters. The MM/GBSA approach was therefore used in this work due to its high precision, resilience, and affordability of computational resources. The values in Table S3 show us that van der Waals energies contributed energy. Finally, the results obtained for APRT/N,N-diethyl-4-methoxy-1-benzofuran-6-carboxamide, and ADL/N,Ndiethyl-4-methoxy-1-benzofuran-6-carboxamide complexes, showed the best average free energy values compared to the other systems (Figure 5).\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

            "text": "An estimated 500,000 new cases of VL and 50,000 fatalities occur each year worldwide, but these numbers are believed to be underrated [66]. Children under the age of ten and those with weakened immune systems are more likely to suffer the disease than immunocompetent patients, whereas risk factors also include malnutrition, poverty, population mobility, and poor hygiene [67,68]. Because of this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set an ambitious goal for the disease's global eradication in its 2021\u201330 neglected tropical diseases roadmap [69]. However, there are still many gaps for VL, particularly in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa [70]. The creation of a human vaccine is still hindered by large gaps in the development pipeline, despite tremendous advances [71]; therefore, the current situation emphasizes the need for more sensitive and rapid diagnostic tests development for early detection, better treatment accessibility, and the discovery of more effective medications [72,73]. However, repurposed drugs make up the majority of the currently available medication options for treating VL, and in recent decades, few novel treatment candidates have advanced through clinical trials [74].\nAcademia and the pharmaceutical industry are aware of the potential uses of NPs as therapeutic medications, herewith there has been a recent upsurge in studies to determine their effectiveness as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of leishmaniasis [75], while several NP groups, including quinones, terpenoids, alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, lignans, and neolignans, have shown anti-leishmanial activity [76]. Effective treatment for complex disorders, such as VL, often involves modulating numerous targets, and because of their advantageous structures, natural products offer a special chance for the development of multi-targeting medications [77]. In light of this, the current study aimed to use CADD approaches to select analogs to NPs with established anti-leishmanial and anti-APRT activities to target multiple PSP proteins. The compound N,N-diethyl-4-methoxy-1-benzofuran-6-carboxamide (ZINC72240060, PubChem CID: 71688722), an analog of the alkaloid Skimmianine, showed a favorable binding affinity to L. infantum-APRT and ADL, with no predicted toxicity and potential for oral route administration.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Likewise, as far as we are aware, no studies on the possible pharmacological activity of N,N-diethyl-4-methoxy-1-benzofuran-6-carboxamide have been published. Conversely, Skimmianine has been extensively studied for antimicrobial, antitrypanosomal, antiinsect, antiplatelet, antidiabetic, antiviral, cholinesterase inhibitory, analgesic, cardiovascular, cytotoxicity, and anti-inflammatory activities [79,80]; whereas also has shown in vitro activity against L. braziliensis, L. amazonensis and L. tropica [81\u201383]. Furthermore, its use in drug development has been justified by its pharmacological characteristics. However, several topics necessitate more research, including the intricate mechanism of action, the connection between structure and activity, toxicological information, and clinical studies [80].\nThe PSP analysis's findings confirm that cheminformatics and bioinformatics offer enticing alternatives to traditional methods for identifying possible therapeutic targets [84]. These in silico methods enable the filtering of proteins that are highly conserved, specific, and/or selective among parasite species and strains, which is important in antileishmanial drug discovery since in vitro evidence of inter-species variations in the susceptibility of parasites to anti-leishmanial drugs has been reported [85]. The phylogenetic analysis of L. infantum-APRT shows that its sole related species is L. braziliensis-APRT when compared to other circulating species in the Americas, which restricts its use for interspecies drug development. Also, the findings further emphasize the significance of the ADL as a potential drug target because of its limited homology to human proteins and its centrality in the PSP proteins network interaction. Also, based on experimental findings, ADL is the only purine-metabolizing enzyme that is essential to the parasite life cycle on its own [86,87]. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that whereas XPRT and HGPRT are required for the parasite, neither is required on its own. [88,89]; Nevertheless, our results showed that both targets' centrality scores on PSP were low and they shared similarities with human proteins, characterizing them as not desirable targets.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

With encouraging outcomes, CADD techniques were used to make it easier to test novel drugs with multitarget properties against illnesses including Dengue fever [91] and Chagas disease [92]. While regarding VL, Xyloguyelline, an aporphynic alkaloid, was chosen as a possible multitarget molecule for VL treatment because it showed action against five key enzymes [93], while obtaining drug-like molecules against VL, the ZINC15 library of biogenic chemicals was used. founded on molecular docking using two targets' binding affinities [94]. Also, Pseudoguaiacanolides and Germanocrolide, two sesquiterpenes, were chosen exclusively by computational methods that examined their capacity to bind to a range of enzyme targets [95]. The creation of novel therapeutics and pharmacology are witnessing a growing trend in multi-target medications. With the advancement of in silico, in vitro, and combination screening methodologies, the search for safer, more effective, and patient-compliant drugs will be sped up [96]."
