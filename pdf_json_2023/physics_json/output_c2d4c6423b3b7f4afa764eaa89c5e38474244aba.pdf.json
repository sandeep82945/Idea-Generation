    "abstractText": "The rational design of cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitors presumes the development of approaches for accurate prediction of selectivity and the activity of small molecular weight anticancer drug candidates. Aiming at attenuation of general toxicity of low selectivity compounds, we herein explored the new chemotype of imidazole-4-N-acetamide substituted derivatives of the pan-CDK inhibitor PHA-793887. Newly synthesized compounds 1\u20134 containing an aliphatic methyl group or aromatic radicals at the periphery of the scaffold were analyzed for the prediction of relative free energies of binding to CDK1, -2, -5, and -9 using a protocol based on non-equilibrium (NEQ) thermodynamics. This methodology allows for the demonstration of a good correlation between the calculated parameters of interaction of 1\u20134 with individual targets and the values of inhibitory potencies in in vitro kinase assays. We provide evidence in support of NEQ thermodynamics as a time sparing, precise, and productive approach for generating chemical inhibitors of clinically relevant anticancer targets.",

            "text": "Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) represent a family of vitally important cellular enzymes that, in complexes with respective cyclins and other protein partners, drive cell cycle progression and modulate gene transcription [1,2]. These properties made CDKs attractive anticancer drug targets. Indeed, inhibition of CDKs with small molecular weight compounds emerged as an area of extensive investigation at the crossroads of medicinal chemistry, cancer biology, and clinical practice. Nevertheless, efforts to design chemical CDK binders encounter serious methodological challenges, mainly the difficulties in predicting the selectivity of structurally similar targets. In particular, for CDK2 inhibitors, researchers deal with structural similarities between the catalytic domains of this enzyme and other CDKs, e.g., CDK1 and CDK9 in activated states [3]. A sizable portion (~30%) of non-selective inhibitors launched in the beginning of the millennium was terminated due to general toxicity [4]. Only recently, selective triple inhibitors of CDK2/4/6 were evaluated as a novel therapeutic approach for advanced or metastatic endocrine cancer in combination with conventional drugs [5\u20137]. We herein report the novel scaffold constructed on the basis of the pan-CDK inhibitor PHA-793887 for targeting individual CDKs [8]. In clinical trials, PHA-793887 caused an intolerable general toxicity manifested as gastrointestinal and neural system disorders, as well as severe dose-related hepatotoxicity [9]. In search of new potent inhibitors with selectivity to individual CDKs, we took advantage of the structure of PHA-793887 for the design of imidazole-4-N-acetamide-based CDK inhibitors [10]. Triazol- and pyrazol-containing compounds are known to evoke liver toxicity [11,12]. Furthermore, the pyrazole cycle was shown to mediate oxidative liver injury [13,14]. Because the hepatotoxicity of PHA-793887 may be attributed to the N-N fragment in the pyrazole cycle, we replaced this fragment with imidazole, whereas the isopropyl moiety in the ring remained unchanged [10]. Over the past decade, advances in computational techniques for predicting the free energies of the binding of compounds to their biological targets rendered this approach relevant for prioritizing the molecules for in silico design. The free energy perturbation (FEP) method uses equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate ligand\u2013protein complexes and allows for estimating the difference in the binding energy between two structurally similar ligands. Despite numerous successful applications, the classic FEP method requires significant computational resources to properly sample the ligand and protein conformations, a crucial factor for the accuracy of results. Recently, the timeefficacious non-equilibrium (NEQ) thermodynamics method was developed [15,16]. Its accuracy is comparable to FEP; moreover, the NEQ method effectively addresses the sampling issue implicit in FEP [17\u201319]. This problem, inherent to FEP, refers to the necessity for extensive, often computationally expensive, sampling of molecular states in order to achieve a robust estimation of free energy changes. Both methods were initially developed to predict the differences in the binding of free energy between ligands. Although these methods can theoretically predict the selectivity (i.e., the differential binding of the same ligand to individual proteins), their application in this specific context remains limited [20]. In the present work, we aimed at the prediction of the relative free energy of binding for newly synthesized imidazole-4-N-acetamide derivatives to their preferred target CDK2 and relative selectivity against CDK1, -5, and -9 using a protocol based on NEQ thermodynamics. This approach allowed us to predict relative binding energy of individual CDK inhibitors with a high degree of correlation between calculated and experimental values. The selected compounds demonstrated a micromolar cytotoxicity against a panel of human tumor cell lines, whereas non-malignant counterparts were spared. These results strengthen the validity of the NEQ approach as a promising tool in targeted drug discovery."

The workflow of the computational protocol.\n2.2.1. Preparation of CDK\u2013Ligand Complexes\nThe X-ray crystal structures of CDK1, -2, -5, and -9 were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Supplementary Materials, Section S1.1). Missing loops or other backbone fragments were constructed using PyMol 2.4.1 software [24] and refined by energy minimization in the OPLS force field using GROMACS 5.0 software [25]. The side chain reconstruction and protonation at pH 7.4 were performed with the Build Model software version 2112.1 [26,27] (Table S1). CDK\u2013ligand complexes were constructed using molecular docking in combination with structural filtration [28] to select ligand conformations that form key hydrogen bonds with the kinase hinge region (Tables S2 and S3). The resulting conformations were in agreement with the structures of known CDK2 inhibitors that have similar scaffolds (Supplementary Materials, Section S1.2.1). We used the QM cluster approach based on the GFN2-xTB semi-empirical method to optimize target\u2013ligand complexes and estimate the binding energy [29] (Supplementary Materials, Section S1.2.2).\nCancers 2023, 15, 3766 4 of 12\n2.2.2. NEQ Thermodynamics and Free Energy Calculations\nWe used NEQ free energy protocol pmx to predict the relative ligand binding affinity [18]. Ligand parametrization was performed using Antechamber [30] and ACPYPE [31] with the general amber force field [32]. Hybrid structures and topologies of ligands and complexes were created using the pmx algorithm [23,33]. We prepared the complexes of 1\u20134 for \u2206\u2206G calculations, considering compound 1 as a reference for all transitions. Equilibrium molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed only for the physical end states for 10 ns in the GROMACS 5.0 software [25]. NEQ transitions for 50 ps were performed in the forward and backward directions using GROMACS [25]. The resulting free energy difference (\u2206\u2206G) was estimated using the pmx procedure [23] with the Jarzynski estimator (JAR) [34], Crooks Gaussian intersection (CGI) [35], and Bennet\u2019s acceptance ratio (BAR) [36]. While JAR approximates the free energy difference by averaging many quick non-equilibrium changes [34], CGI calculates free energy differences using the intersection point of energy distributions obtained from forward and reverse transformations [35]. The BAR method enhances these estimations by optimal combination of forward and reverse data to calculate free energy differences [36]. The overview of calculation workflow is presented in Figure S2."

Table 1 shows that CDK2 in complexes with cyclin E was exceptionally sensitive to each compound, with IC50 values in the submicromolar range. The inhibitory profile of 3 was similar to that of 1 except for CDK1/cyclin E. Compound 2 demonstrated the highest inhibitory potency against all tested CDK/cyclin complexes. In contrast to 2, compound 4 was several-fold less potent against CDK1/cyclin E and CDK5/p35."

            "text": "According to NEQ calculations, the sin-2 conformation was preferable for each examined CDK, whereas anti-4 was favorable for CDK1 and -9 (Table S7). Results of QM and NEQ are largely consistent except for sin-2 in CDK5 and sin-4 for CDK2. Admittedly, the failure to account for dynamic influences, such as conformational focusing, limits the QM approach (Supplementary Materials, Section S2). To evaluate the accuracy of relative free energy predictions for 1 vs. 2 and 4, we selected the conformation with the lowest \u2206\u2206G values. The NEQ-based predictions of relative free energy showed a good agreement with the kinase inhibitory potencies. The correlation coefficients R2 between experimental and calculated \u2206\u2206G values were 0.67, 0.75, and 0.73 for BAR, CGI, and JAR methods, respectively. To account for experimental and calculated errors, we used Deming regression to fit the regression line assuming normally distributed errors in measurements of \u2206\u2206G(calc) and \u2206\u2206G(exp) (see Formula (1)). Apparently, the 95% CI values for Deming regression slopes were >0 for BAR and JAR methods, indicating statistically significant correlation (Figure 4). The selectivity change \u2206S between CDK2 ligands was calculated based on \u2206\u2206G values according to the Formula (2), where k is CDK1, -5, or -9, i means compound 2, and j means 1, 3, or 4 (Table S8). For clarity, the correlation of selectivity data is presented with reference to 2, as this compound demonstrated no target selectivity. As expected, the reliability of \u2206S prediction was lower since the \u2206S metric includes the total error of the two \u2206\u2206G values. The correlation coefficients R2 \u2206S values were 0.52, 0.49, and 0.68 for BAR, CGI, and JAR methods, respectively. However, 95% CI for Deming regression slopes were greater than 0 for all methods (Figure 5).\nCancers 2023, 15, 3766 7 of 12\nCancers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0

Correlation and Deming regressio analyses for xperimental \u2206S(exp) nd calculated S(calc) relative s lectivity values. See legend to Figure 4 for details.\nur calculations demonstrate that, in general, NEQ methods provided consistent accurate estimation of \u2206\u2206G and \u2206S. The mean absolute error (MAE) value for \u2206\u2206G is 3.5 kJ/mol (equivalent to 0.83 kcal/mol), whic fits the standard for \u2206\u2206G estimation. In terms of selec ivi y, the JAR method performed unexpectedly better an the typically\nre precise CGI and BAR. The accuracy of \u2206S prediction obtained by JAR is similar to that observed in relative FEP, for w ich the accuracy of \u2206S prediction is 5.9 kJ/mol (1.4 kcal/mol). Nevertheless, we admit that the limitation stemming from the small sample size should be kept in mind for interpretation. MD analysis revealed the reasons for superior inhibitory efficacy of compound 2, over 1 and 3, towards all examined CDKs (Table 1). In particular, the biologically active conformation of 2 is stabilized by a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond, while target\nCancers 2023, 15, 3766 8 of 12\nbinding by 1 and 3 requires an additional energy. We suggest that the H bond formation in solution decreases the conformational focusing, i.e., the energy required to convert all conformers in solution into the binding conformation [46]. Notably, compound 4, in which an intramolecular bond was formed through water molecule, exhibited similar behavior (for more details see Supplementary Materials Section S2, Figures S3 and S4). Furthermore, the higher inhibitory potency of 2, in comparison to 4, towards CDK1 and -5 is likely due to \u03c0-stacking interactions of the aromatic ring with Lys89 (Table S6). Using electrostatic potential calculations, we demonstrated that the charge distribution in the phenol moiety promotes \u03c0-stacking and enhances the binding of 2 to CDK1 and -5 compared to benzene (compounds 1 and 3) and pyridine (compound 4) moieties (for more details see Supplementary Materials Section S3, Figure S5)."

            "text": "Compounds 2 and 4 were the two most potent CDK inhibitors in in vitro kinase assays (Table 1). At submicromolar concentrations, 2 inhibited all tested CDKs in complexes with cognate cyclin partners, whereas 4 preferentially targeted CDK2/cyclin E and CDK9/cyclin K. We were interested in whether the potency in cell-free systems can be translated into the ability to induce the death of human tumor cell lines. Our panel included ovarian cancer and neuroblastoma, the tumor types in which CDKs were validated as therapeutic targets [47]. Both 2 and 4 were cytotoxic at low micromolar concentrations in all tested tumor cell lines, with SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma being an exception. Importantly, nonmalignant human HELF and MSC cells were not affected even after 72 h of exposure (Table 2)."

            "text": "This study shows that the computational protocol based on methods of NEQ thermodynamics is efficient for the optimization of the binding affinity and selectivity of small molecular weight compounds as CDK/cyclin inhibitors. The use of Deming regression confirmed the statistical significance of the correlation between calculated and experimental \u2206\u2206G and \u2206S values. All NEQ methods showed comparable accuracy of \u2206\u2206G and \u2206S estimation, with the JAR method being a potential alternative to the relative FEP method in predicting \u2206S. The observed high accuracy is important because the calculation was performed without core NEQ protocol adjustment and took ~40% less time than the enhanced FEP calculations [20]. Addressing the problem of extensive sampling of multiple local minima, we used a comprehensive workflow for preparing starting target\u2013ligand complexes based on molecular docking, structural filtration, and QM. We used the semi-empirical QM cluster approach [29] to optimize alternative ligand conformations in different local energy minima identified by molecular docking. For each local minimum of the ligand conformation,\nCancers 2023, 15, 3766 9 of 12\nwe used the optimized structures for MD simulations and NEQ. By utilizing multiple conformations, we constrained the sampling to the region of the local minimum, thereby shortening the time of MD simulations. Importantly, the QM-based estimation of target\u2013ligand binding energy allows for qualitatively assessing the biological activity (Supplementary Materials, Section S1.2.2) and is therefore pertinent to the initial prediction of the compound\u2019s selectivity profile. Nevertheless, we anticipated that the MD-based relative free energy calculation would yield more rigorous affinity predictions. Additionally, MD analysis provides a qualitative explanation for differences in binding associated with structural modifications of ligands. Finally, we demonstrated that 2 and 4 were cytotoxic for tumor types in which CDKs are being investigated as tentative therapeutic targets. The cytotoxicity was achieved at low micromolar concentrations of each compound. Importantly, non-malignant cells were not affected in the tested dose range, suggesting a safe application in a broad therapeutic window. Both compounds were similarly potent against a series of ovarian carcinoma and neuroblastoma cell lines except SH-SY5Y. Mechanisms of differential efficacy of 2 and 4 for individual cell lines remain to be elucidated. Our calculation and in vitro data indicated similar, although not identical, inhibitory profiles for compounds 2 and 4, with compound 2 being less selective. The common targets for these agents were CDK2/cyclin E and CDK9/cyclin K (Table 1). One may surmise that inhibition of CDK1/cyclin E and CDK5/p35 complexes by 2 is tolerable, whereas targeting CDK2/cyclin E and/or CDK9/cyclin K is lethal. Moreover, targets of our new compounds may not be confined solely to the tested CDKs. An in-depth study of molecular \u2018portraits\u2019 of individual tumors is underway to evaluate the mechanisms of sensitivity of specific tumor types to the new chemotype."

This approach integrated the molecular docking, structural filtration, and QMbased clustering to prepare optimal protein\u2013ligand complexes, which were then used to calculate \u2206\u2206G and \u2206S through the NEQ-based computational workflow. The developed procedure provided the rationale for changes in the activity and specificity in the course of transitions between imidazole-4-N-acetamide derivatives. The predicted CDK inhibitory profiles as well as the cytotoxic potency against tumor cells without affecting non-malignant counterparts prove the potential of the new scaffold in antitumor drug design.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cancers15153766/s1.
