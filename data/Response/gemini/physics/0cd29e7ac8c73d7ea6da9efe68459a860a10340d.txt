1. **Investigate the effect of different hydrolysis conditions on the antioxidant activity of soy protein hydrolysates.** This could involve varying the enzyme concentration, temperature, pH, and hydrolysis time to determine the optimal conditions for producing hydrolysates with the highest antioxidant activity.


2. **Evaluate the antioxidant activity of soy protein hydrolysates in different food systems.** This could involve adding hydrolysates to edible oils, fried foods, or other food products and measuring the oxidative stability of the products over time. This would help to determine the potential applications of soy protein hydrolysates as natural antioxidants in food products.


3. **Study the mechanism by which soy protein hydrolysates exert their antioxidant activity.** This could involve using in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the ability of hydrolysates to scavenge free radicals, chelate metal ions, or inhibit lipid peroxidation. This information would help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the antioxidant activity of soy protein hydrolysates.


4. **Explore the potential health benefits of soy protein hydrolysates.** This could involve conducting animal or human studies to investigate the effects of hydrolysates on oxidative stress, inflammation, and other health markers. This would help to determine the potential role of soy protein hydrolysates in promoting human health.


5. **Develop novel food products containing soy protein hydrolysates.** This could involve incorporating hydrolysates into functional foods, such as beverages, snacks, or supplements, to improve their nutritional value and antioxidant content. This would help to increase the consumption of soy protein hydrolysates and promote their potential health benefits.
