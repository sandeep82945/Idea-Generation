    "abstractText": "Several anti-HIV scaffolds have been proposed as complementary treatments to highly active antiretroviral therapy. AnkGAG1D4, a designed ankyrin repeat protein, formerly demonstrated anti-HIV-1 replication by interfering with HIV-1 Gag polymerization. However, the improvement of the effectiveness was considered. Recently, the dimeric molecules of AnkGAG1D4 were accomplished in enhancing the binding activity against HIV-1 capsid (CAp24). In this study, the interaction of CAp24 against the dimer conformations was elucidated to elaborate the bifunctional property. The accessibility of the ankyrin binding domains was inspected by bio-layer interferometry. By inverting the second module of dimeric ankyrin (Ank1D4NC-CN), the CAp24 interaction KD was significantly reduced. This reflects the capability of Ank1D4NC-CN in simultaneously capturing CAp24. On the contrary, the binding activity of dimeric Ank1D4NC-NC was indistinguishable from the monomeric AnkGAG1D4. The bifunctional property of Ank1D4NC-CN was subsequently confirmed in the secondary reaction with additional p17p24. This data correlates with the MD simulation, which suggested the flexibility of the Ank1D4NC-CN structure. The CAp24 capturing capacity was influenced by the distance of the AnkGAG1D4 binding domains to introduce the avidity mode of Ank1D4NC-CN. Consequently, Ank1D4NC-CN showed superior potency in interfering with HIV-1 NL4-3 WT and HIV-1 NL4-3 MIRCAI201V replication than Ank1D4NC-NC and an affinity improved AnkGAG1D4-S45Y.",

Certain proteins are currently attracting attention for the interference of HIV-1 replication. The potential of designed ankyrin-repeat proteins (DARPins) has been proposed as an alternative treatment to monoclonal antibodies [1\u20133]. AnkGAG1D4 is an intracellular anti-HIV-1 DARPin that specifically targets HIV-1 capsid CAp24 [4]. This Gag-specific artificial ankyrin inhibits HIV-1 virion production in the latestage HIV-1 life cycle. Additionally, the ability of AnkGAG1D4 to disturb gag distribution in infected cells and interfere with RNA packaging of HIV-1 virion was demonstrated [5]. However, the HIV-1 protection by AnkGAG1D4 in long-term culture is insufficient. Although this phenomenon may not represent actual infection, improving the binding activity of AnkGAG1D4 against HIV-1 CAp24 should be considered. Previously, the affinity of AnkGAG1D4 in targeting CAp24 was improved. The amino acid residue of AnkGAG1D4 was modified by substitution serine (S) for tyrosine (Y) at position 45 to increase the binding affinity. According to the bio-layer interferometry (BLI) experiment, AnkGAG1D4-S45Y mutant successfully improved the binding affinity compared to AnkGAG1D4 [6]. Likewise, AnkGAG1D4-S45Y markedly inhibits HIV-1 wild-type and the HIV-1 maturation inhibitor-resistant (MIR) strain in SupT1 cells [7]. However, viral escape was observed in late infection. Apart from mutagenesis, the construction of multimers is an alternative strategy. Bispecific-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) DARPin with subnanomolar affinity dramatically reduced surface EGFR levels by inhibiting A431 cell proliferation and receptor recycling [8]. Recently, trimeric DARPins FSR16m and FSR22 efficiently block the SARS-CoV-2 virus entry by binding the RBD with high avidity compared to monomeric DARPin SR16m and SR22 [9]. Furthermore, tri-specific DARPin, Ensovibep, recognized the three units of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with picomolar range promising clinical candidate [10]. In reliance on this strategy, dimeric AnkGAG1D4 (AnkGAG1D4NC-NC and AnkGAG1D4NC-CN) was synthesized and demonstrated improved avidity against CAp24. The binding activity of AnkGAG1D4NC-CN was remarkably improved compared to AnkGAG1D4NC-NC and parental AnkGAG1D4 [11]. A design strategy described in this study involved inverting the second module in AnkGAG1D4NC-CN to promote the bifunctional property when targeting a large molecule. The biological function of dimeric AnkGAG1D4 in interfering with HIV-1 replication has yet to be elucidated. The challenge in HIV-1 treatment is emerging of ART-resistant mutation. Several alternative anti-HIV-1 inhibitors were researched to counteract this issue. Due to a high-level sequence conservation, HIV-1 CAp24 is a promising target for an anti-HIV-1 strategy [12,13]. HIV-1 maturation inhibitor (MI) is a class of anti-HIV-1 compounds that block HIV-1 Gag processing at the CA-SP1 junction, resulting in an immature HIV-1 virion production [14,15]. However, the mutation in a target region of MI was reported [16\u201318]. A mutation at the HIV-1 C-terminus of the capsid (CA-CTD), isoleucine (I) position 201 to valine (V), results in PF46396 resistance and partial resistance against Bevirimat [16]. Since the mutation occurs in the CA-CTD unrelated to the target region of ankyrin, dimeric ankyrins are presumed to interfere with HIV-1 MIRCAI201V virus production. This study demonstrated an intracellular anti-HIV-1 activity of dimeric AnkGAG1D4 in HIV-1 infected SupT1 cells. Additionally, the antiviral activity of dimeric AnkGAG1D4 was investigated in HIV-1 CA-mutation strains. HIV-1 NL4-3 MIRCAI201V was the representative model for the HIV-1 MIR virus. In contrast to monomeric AnkGAG1D4-S45Y, our results indicate an improvement of dimeric AnkGAG1D4 in effectively inhibiting HIV-1 replication."

Corresponding to binding kinetic constants, AnkGAG1D4NC-CN (KD < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 M) is significantly stronger than AnkGAG1D4NC-NC (KD = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22128 M) (Table 2). These data confirmed that both binding pockets of the dimeric AnkGAG1D4NC-CN were active, while AnkGAG1D4NC-NC has only one main binding site with a much weaker second binding site. Int. J. Mol.

Additionally, Ankyrin localization was also determined in HeLa cells by apotome imaging. Ankyrin showed a predominant expression at the plasma membrane and lower distribution in the cytoplasm (Figure 6A). Apotome imaging suggested that ankyrins were shunted to the plasma membrane, which supports the possibility of ankyrin inhibiting viral replication. Additionally, ankyrin distribution at the plasma membrane was not different in each ankyrin-expressing cell (Figure 6B). As a consequence of the N-terminus myristoylated signal, ankyrins were targeted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Since CD4 is a crucial receptor for HIV-1 entry, it is necessary to determine whether an expression of ankyrin interfered with surface CD4 expression in SupT1 cells. Flow cytometry showed the number of CD4-positive cells in ankyrin-expressing SupT1 to no ankyrin cells (Figure 7A). MFI of CD4 in SupT1 cells and ankyrin-expressing SupT1 cells (Myr (+) AnkA32D3 and Myr (+) AnkGAG1D4-S45Y, Myr (+) AnkGAG1D4NC-NC, and Myr (+) AnkGAG1D4NC-CN) was 3.16 \u00d7 104, 3.62 \u00d7 104, 3.56 \u00d7 104, 4.21 \u00d7 104, and 3.57 \u00d7 104, respectively (Figure 7B).

DARPin MP0274, targeting human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), has been evaluated in clinical trials for cancer treatment [20]. Improving the binding affinity of DARPins could enhance antiviral activity. Trimeric DARPin, Ensovibep, was explicitly designed to inactivate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It includes three individual DARPin domains neutralizing against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to reduce viral replication in the lower and upper respiratory tract [21]. AnkGAG1D4-S45Y mutant as a specific CAp24 domain inhibitor of HIV-1 Gag was constructed using sited-direct mutagenesis. The binding affinity of AnkGAG1D4-S45Y mutant (KD = 45 nM) was partly enhanced and inhibited either HIV-1 wild-type or the HIV maturation inhibitor-resistant strain for intracellular activity compared to parental AnkGAG1D4 (KD = 109 nM) [6,7]. Dimeric AnkGAG1D4 was generated to further improve\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5266 14 of 19\nits binding activity and evaluated for the binding activity [11] (Figure S1). The (G4S)4 linker was applied to the dimeric ankyrin structure, providing flexibility and high solubility of molecules [22]. The G4S linker provides flexibility and solubility in bidomain molecules, such as scFSH scaffolds [23], and \u03b1Rep homo-bidomain (A3_A3) [24]. For these reasons, the (G4S)4 linker might support the intracellular activity of dimeric ankyrin. Regarding the BLI and MD, AnkGAG1D4NC-NC and AnkGAG1D4NC-CN show different binding characteristics. Bio-layer interferometry demonstrated that AnkGAG1D4NC-CN remarkably promoted the binding activity, achieving the pM avidity characteristic. The secondary interaction signal of AnkGAG1D4NC-CN in BLI suggested the bifunctional motif in contrast to AnkGAG1D4NC-NC. In contrast, the binding activity of AnkGAG1D4NC-NC was insignificantly enhanced and lacked the ability to capture the additional p17p24. This suggests the steric hindrance introduced after interacting with the immobilized p24, causing improper orientation of the AnkGAG1D4NC-NC that limits the access of p17p24 to the second binding site. This data consensus with the MD simulation in which the binding surfaces of AnkGAG1D4NC-CN synchronically interact with CAp24. Half of the AnkGAG1D4NC-NC conformations preferred a 1:1 interaction, whereas most AnkGAG1D4NC-CN favored a 1:2 interaction. This phenomenon confers the potential of AnkGAG1D4NC-CN to interfere with HIV-1 Gag-assemble compared to AnkGAG1D4NC-NC and monomeric AnkGAG1D4. Previously, an anti-HIV-1 production of AnkGAG1D4-S45Y has been expressed, and the leakage of HIV-1 virions production was detected in the late infection [7]. Although AnkGAG1D4-S45Y enhanced anti-HIV-1 activity, both dimeric ankyrins were superior. Additionally, the anti-HIV-1 activity of dimeric ankyrin was also investigated in the HIV-1 NL4-3 MIRCAI201V virus, which served as a CA-mutation virus model. Since this mutation occurs in CA-CTD, the monomeric and dimeric forms of AnkGAG1D4 were presumed to inhibit HIV-1 NL4-3 MIRCAI201V virus replication. In this study, AnkGAG1D4-S45Y and dimeric ankyrins showed a remarkable reduction in the viral progeny production in HIV-1 NL4-3 MIRCAI201V infection. This finding suggested that AnkGAG1D4NC-NC and AnkGAG1D4NC-CN retain their functionality to accommodate different CAp24 molecules promising to interfere with Gag packaging simultaneously. Interestingly, the bifunctional property of AnkGAG1D4NC-NC was not indicated by BLI, whereas the inhibitory effect was significantly improved in comparison with AnkGAG1D4-S45Y. We hypothesized that the intercellular flexibility of AnkGAG1D4NC-NC is more compromised than in vitro. In addition, the dimension of AnkGAG1D4NC-NC is doubling of AnkGAG1D4-S45Y, thus more efficient in perturbing capsid assembly. Further exploration should be performed to explain this phenomenon. The results of this study suggested that the inverted second module of AnkGAG1D4NC-CN efficiently conforms to bifunctional activity. Considering the conformational structure of AnkGAG1D4NC-CN, it conducts a superior inhibitory response than AnkGAG1D4NC-NC. To provide the occupied dimension for CAp24, it is crucial to consider the effect of the extended distance between the binding surfaces apart from the flexibility of the linker. When dimeric ankyrins are expressed in the infected cells, they enhance the inhibitory activity against the HIV-1 NL4-3 WT virus. On days 7 and 13, the difference of CAp24 in the presence of AnkGAG1D4-S45Y and dimers is significant compared to no ankyrin control (>1000-fold). However, after day 19 the control groups were terminated since the cell viability drastically decreased. Thus, on day 21 the CAp24 level was determined only with AnkGAG1D4-S45Y and dimers. Most infected cells harboring AnkGAG1D4-S45Y and dimers survived and continuously generated a small number of viral particles. Although the fold difference of CAp24 among this group is not much, the protection of dimers was significantly different from AnkGAG1D4-S45Y in the WT virus. Moreover, dimeric ankyrins retain their viral protection activity against HIV-1 NL4-3 MIRCAI201V virus replication in SupT1 cells. Other drug-resistant strains regarding mutation at the capsid domain will be further evaluated. A substantial increase in pretreatment drug resistance prevalence indicated that first-line ART could not completely eradicate HIV-1 infection [25]. Based on our findings, gene therapy\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5266 15 of 19\nusing AnkGAG1D4NC-CN could be feasible to integrate with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for sustainable treatment. Dimeric ankyrin AnkGAG1D4NC-CN provides the avidity function regarding the flexible structure and the simultaneous accessibility of the interacting modules. The advantage of AnkGAG1D4NC-CN is the forceful interaction against the juxtaposed Gag molecules, thus efficiently interfering with the HIV-1 assembly process."

Two oxygens of the carboxyl group were removed, and the carbon atom of this group was swapped with the nitrogen atom of the amino group.

The (G4S)4 linker was extracted from the crystal structure of scFv-IL-1B (PDB ID: 2KH2) [28]. It was inserted with residues LLQ at the N-terminus and with residues TSDL at the C-terminus. The residues LLQ and TSDL were superimposed with the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acids of the first and second ankyrin modules, respectively. After superimposing the LL residues of AnkGAG1D4 with the LL residues of the linker, two possible conformations of the AnkGAG1D4-linker were generated. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of each AnkGAG1D4-linker were performed using NAMD software version 1.1422 for 5 ns under the CHARMM36 force field [29]. TIP3P59 water was employed at 310 K and 1 atm. The folding dynamics were simulated with an integration time step of 2 fs, evaluated nonbonded every 1 fs, and updated electrostatics every 2 fs. Afterward, the last four residues (TSDL) of the MD AnkGAG1D4-linker were superimposed with another AnkGAG1D4 or an inverted AnkGAG1D4 module to create the dimeric AnkGAG1D4NC-NC and AnkGAG1D4NC-CN, respectively. The dimers depicting the crashing structures of the ankyrin modules and linker were excluded. The remaining generated structures were analyzed for dimer behavior in interacting with CAp24. The duplex ankyrin modules were conclusively superimposed with the docking complex of AnkGAG1D4 and CAp24 from a previous study [19]. The binding ratio of each dimer to CAp24 was also investigated."
