    "abstractText": "Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA viral load is used as a surrogate marker to start Rituximab in transplant recipients at risk of developing PTLD. However, an elevated EBV DNAemia does not discriminate lymphoproliferation and replication. We designed a new molecular assay (methyl-qPCR) to distinguish methylated versus unmethylated viral genomes. In blood, viral genomes were highly methylated in EBV primary infections, PTLD and 4/5 transplant recipients with high viral load. The only patient with under-methylated EBV genomes did not respond to rituximab. Methyl-qPCR is a convenient method to discriminate between latent and lytic EBV genomes and could be useful in treatment decisions.",

            "text": "Transplant recipients are at high risk of developing Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)-associated Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Diseases (PTLD), a group of lymphoid or plasmacytic proliferations that develops as a consequence of immunosuppression after solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [1\u20133]. EBV life cycle alternates latent and lytic phases. Latency has been associated with the expression of a limited set of genes required for viral persistency and cell transformation, whereas the lytic phase is required for the production of viral particles. EBV DNA viral load (EBV VL) in whole blood (WB) or plasma is widely used in highrisk HSCT patients as a surrogate marker to identify sub-clinical PTLD and to start a pre-emptive treatment with the anti-CD20 rituximab [4\u20136]. However, there is no clear consensus regarding the threshold of EBV DNA that should lead to the start of pre-emptive therapy. In addition, EBV VL, albeit sensitive, keeps a poor positive predictive value for the occurrence of PTLD, which leads to an excess of rituximab therapy [7, 8]. In a non-mutually exclusive manner, an elevated EBV VL may result from an increase in the number of circulating EBV-positive lymphocytes (EBV latent phase), and/or an increase in EBV lytic replication (EBV reactivation), which raises important questions regarding the origin of increased viral load: lymphoproliferation and/or EBV replication [8].\nIt has been demonstrated that the viral genome is heavily methylated on specific sites in EBV-infected cancer cells and latently infected cell lines [9, 10]. Conversely, EBV genomes are under-methylated in cells undergoing lytic replication as well as in viral particles [10]. Using a combination of methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes and PCR on specific regions of the viral genome, we designed a new and convenient molecular assay thereafter named\n*Correspondence: eolia.brissot@aphp.fr \u2020The authors Chlo\u00e9 Borde, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Quignon, Corinne Amiel and Jo\u00ebl Gozlan contributed equally to this work. \u2020The authors Vincent Marechal and Eolia Brissot share the senior authorship position. 5 Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), 75012 Paris, France Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nmethyl-qPCR that allows the differential quantification of methylated vs unmethylated viral genomes as a reflect of the relative proportion of latent versus lytic viral genomes in clinical samples."

MspI and HpaII are isoschizomers with differing sensitivities to CpG methylation. MspI cleaves both unmethylated and methylated CCGG sites, whereas HpaII cleaves only the unmethylated form of the restriction site. Specific primers were designed around each region of interest to amplify DNA following incubation with each enzyme (see Additional file\u00a01: Figure S1)."

Then, the four regions of\ninterest were quantified by real-time PCR using TaqPath QPCR (ThermoFisher) with specific primers (Additional file\u00a0 1: Figures\u00a0 S1B, S2). Cellular \u00df-globin was co-amplified as a positive control and to allow normalization of EBV DNA quantitation. Reactions were performed on a Biorad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR machine. The methylation index was defined according to the 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct method proposed by Livak and Schmittgen [12]. The methylation index is equal to 2\u2206\u2206CT, where \u2206\u2206CT is equal to \u2206CTuntreated (cycle threshold [CT] of the EBV target gene minus CT of the \u00df-globin reference gene measured on the untreated sample) minus \u2206CTtreated (CT of the EBV target gene minus CT of the \u00df-globin reference gene measured on HpaII treated sample). Therefore, the methylation index is equal to 2(\u2206CTuntreated\u2212\u2206CTtreated). When the target is methylated, HpaII treatment has no effect and the methylation index is close to 1. When the target is demethylated, i.e., accessible to degradation by HpaII, 2\u2206\u2206CT tends to 0. For reasons related to experimental variations in CT measurement, the methylation index may occasionally be higher than 1 for highly methylated targets. Since MspI is degrading both methylated and unmethylated target, 2\u2206\u2206CT should always be close to 0 for MspI treated samples, providing evidence that the HpaII/MspI restriction site is present in the target EBV sequence (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S1A)."

For PTLD patients, the high methylation index in most EBV regions tested confirmed that EBV DNA was under a latent form indicating that the high viral load was indeed due to the proliferation of cells containing latent genomes in these patients (Fig.\u00a0 1E and Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S4B). A high methylation index was also measured in 4 out of 5 patients with high EBV VL but no proven PTLD (Fig.\u00a01F and Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S4C). Only one patient displayed a low methylation index in the four regions tested. Interestingly, this patient kept a high EBV VL despite eight injections of rituximab suggesting that a high viral load originating from lytically infected cells might be less sensitive to B cell destruction mediated by anti-CD20 antibody.\nImportantly, no correlation was observed between the level of methylation and the viral load, whatever the viral region or the patients (data not shown)."

This proofof-concept study, which was applied to a small number of patients, confirmed that EBV load in samples from IM, from PTLD or from suspected PTLD samples are mostly methylated, i.e., issued from latently infected cells. A larger cohort analysis on allogenic HSCT recipients with high EBV VL is now undertaken to confirm these preliminary data, to compare methylation status of EBV DNA in WB and plasma and to analyze the correlation between DNA methylation and response to a pre-emptive therapy with rituximab. We believe that this method will allow a more accurate selection of patients with high EBV VL who should benefit from rituximab therapy.\nAbbreviations EBV: Epstein\u2013Barr virus; HSCT: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation; PTLD: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease; VL: Viral load.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13148- 022- 01255-1.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Figure S1.\nAcknowledgements This study was supported by the Programme de Recherche Translationnelle en Canc\u00e9rologie (PRT-K) (INCa-DGOS).
