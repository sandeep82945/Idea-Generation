INTRODUCTION Advances in fabrication process enabled the use of manycore architectures for High Performance Computing (HPC) [1]. Due to their increasing complexity and the heterogeneity of targeted applications, task mapping became critical to optimize execution time, energy efficiency and reliability [2]. Considering the large number of diversity of cores, memories, and accelerators, Network on Chips (NoCs) naturally became the backbones of manycore architectures. This further complexifies task allocation [3], which now require complex algorithms involving, for instance, neural networks [4]. On the performance side, nanophotonic interconnects, also called Optical Networks-on-Chip (ONoCs), have the potential to deliver the bandwidth required by data intensive applications in HPC [5]. However, they suffer from high static power consumption, which is mostly due to losses experienced by optical signals and devices calibration requirements. Indeed, optical devices are sensitive to manufacturing process and thermal variations, which call for constant calibration of resonating devices such as ring resonators [6].\nTo reduce the static power consumption of nanophotonic interconnects, we investigate the use of Phase Change Material (PCM) elements to bypass unused optical devices. Indeed, the high contrast between crystalline (cr) and amorphous (am) phase states has enabled the design of non-volatile directional couplers [7]. A key limitation of PCM elements is the slow phase state changes compared to the required nanosecond scale latency communication requirements in manycore. We tackle this challenge by partitioning the manycore to execute different applications and by reconfiguring the interconnect only when new applications are executed. While recent studies have\ndemonstrated the efficiency of PCMs to design multi-level optical memories [8] and weighting functions in spiking neural networks [9], this work is the first attempt to use the technology in nanophotonic interconnects. The contributions are the following. We propose a non-volatile Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR) optical channel. The channel is reconfigurable and allows to bypass unused readers using PCM-based directional couplers. We develop a method to configure the interconnect according to the mapping of applications on the cores. To do this, we modified SNIPER simulator to enable the thread distribution of multi-applications from Splash2 and PARSEC benchmarks. We evaluate the power consumption of the network using a model we developed. We show that an average of 21% power saving is obtained compared to channels without PCM, and up 52% saving is reached for mapping involving 4 clusters. Finally, we simulate the execution of the applications in parallel by considering the proposed reconfigurable interconnect. This allows us to divide the architecture to execute two applications independently and simultaneously. On average, we obtain a 21.6% reduction in the execution time. The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses related works. In Section III, we present the proposed PCM based optical interconnect. Section IV describes the power model. Section V presents the experimental setups and Section VI is results section. Section VII concludes the work.\nII. RELATED WORK"

At the link level, PID controllers are designed to compensate the effect of temperature variation on the wavelength shift of ring resonator resonance [11]. While the design in [11] involves to monitor received optical signals, the controlled proposed in [12] relies on sensors monitoring the temperature of ring resonators. At the network level, reconfigurable interconnects were proposed to optimize the use of optical channels [5], thus allowing to reduce the resources overhead. At system level, application-specific mapping methods allow to reduce crosstalk noise [13]. Run-time methods enabling to select the number of used wavelengths according to bandwidth requirement was proposed in [6]. Approximate computing techniques were also investigated to reduce bandwidth requirement [14]. All these approaches are complementary to this work, which aims at using PCM to reduce the static power."

The design proposed in [7] relies on a PCM element inserted between the branches of a directional coupler. The signal transmission depends on the phase state of the material: amorphous (am) and crystalline (cr) states lead to cross and bar transmission respectively.

As in conventional SWMR channel, the writer modulates the optical signal, which propagates towards the destination receiver where Opto-Electronic (OE) conversions are carried out. However, unlike conventional SWMR channels where all intermediate receivers must be crossed before reaching the destination, the configuration ability of the proposed SWMR channel allows to connect only a selected set of readers. By disconnecting readers from the optical path, we aim at reducing the power consumption as follows: i) MRRs in disconnected receivers do not require, power hungry, calibration and ii) optical losses can be reduced since signals do not propagate through all the MRRs.\nTo achieve this, we introduce a bypass waveguide at each reader, and we use a Directional Coupler (DC) between each reader to configure the optical path as represented in Figure 1. For each DC, the path can be configured to transmit signals towards the bypass waveguide or towards the receiver. The couplers are large band, thus allowing transmitting all modulated signals to a same output waveguide. The DC is configured according to the state of an embedded PCM element, as shown in Figure 1.c:\namorphous (am) and crystalline (cr) phases lead to cross and bar configuration respectively. The PCM is non-volatile, thus allowing maintaining the DC configuration without consuming static energy."

            "text": "Considering the rather slow state change of PCM elements (around 100ns [16]) and their limited endurance, the SWMR channels are configured according to application specific or architecture specific connectivity requirements. The execution times of the targeted benchmarks applications, which typically range from 100ms to 10s, will ensure a low reconfiguration frequency of the SWMR channel (<<1Hz). The connectivity requirements depend on the number of writers (i.e. the number of SWMR channels) and number of readers per channel. In the context of manycore architectures where multiple SWMR channels are used, each channel is configured according to the list of readers to be reached by the writer. To connect a reader, the preceding DC is configured either to cross if the previous reader is disconnected (i.e. signals coming from bypass) or to bar if the previous reader is also connected. Since we assume that a SWMR configuration does not change during the execution of an application, the MRRs of disconnected readers are not calibrated. On the contrary, the MRRs of connected readers are calibrated as follows: MRRs of the destination receiver drop the signals from the waveguides, while the others MRRs let the signals propagating (through). Maintaining the calibration of all connected MRRs allows minimizing the communication latency overhead [12]. To further save energy, the injected laser power is adapted to losses experienced by the optical signal for each configuration.\nFigure 2 illustrates various connectivity scenarios for a 4- readers SWMR channel. We assume three wavelengths, thus leading to three MRRs per reader. The scenarios are:\n all readers connected (Figure 2.a) leads to a regular SWMR channel for which all the MRRs require\ncalibration. To achieve the channel configurations, all the PCM elements are set to cr state, thus leading to bar transmission for the directional couplers. As previously mentioned, any of the connected receivers can be reached by the writer by calibrating the corresponding MRRs to the drop transmission .\n(the others MRRs are calibrated to through transmission).\nRegarding the optical losses, this configuration leads to the highest losses, and hence highest laser power requirements, since the optical signal can propagate through all MRRs.  r2, r3 and r4 connected (Figure 2.b) require to bypass r1, which is achieved by configuring DC1 to the am state. Since\nr2 is part of the connected readers, DC2 is also configured to am. The rest of the PCMs are set to cr state, thus allowing to transmit the signals to r3 and r4. Since one reader is bypassed, the MRR through losses are reduced, thus leading to laser power saving. Furthermore, reduction of calibration power is also achieved since signals do not propagate through r1.  r1 and r3 connected (Figure 2.c) involves bypassing r2. PCM element in DC1 is configured to am, thus allowing the signal\npropagation through r1. To bypass r2, PCM elements in DC2 and DC3 are also configured to am. Since r4 is also disconnected and is beyond the last connected reader, DC4 does not require any specific configuration. In term of power, further reduction can be achieved compared to previous scenario due to lower MRRs losses, waveguide propagation losses and MRR calibration.  r2 connected (Figure 2.d) leads to SWSR channel. To achieve this, DC1 and DC2 are set to cross state while DC3 and DC4"

Indeed, when executing a new set of applications, the interface connectivity might change, thus leading to a different set of connected readers. This requires changing the state of PCMs from cr to am or from am to cr, which requires energy. By assuming PCM already configured for a given connectivity requirement, we obtain reconfiguration power using Eq. 8. It is worth mentioning that the reconfiguration time of the PCMs is not critical in our system since SWMR channels are reconfigured only when new applications are executed. Hence, the design of circuits to change PCM state is out of the scope of the paper but details related to implementation involving electrical pulses, optical pulses or external heaters can be found in [18].\nV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP A. Architecture\nWe consider the 3D architecture illustrated in Figure 3: bottom layer implements processing units and memories, while top layer implements the optical interconnect. It is composed of 16 clusters of 4 cores. Each cluster includes a shared last level cache (L3). Each core has a private L1 data (L1d), instructions (L1i) caches, of 32KB each, and a private L2 cache of 512KB. MESI protocol ensures coherency between the distributed caches. All clusters are connected with ONIs through TSVs. Each ONI has 1 transmitting and 15 receiving waveguides which are featured with SWMR and WDM, and include PCM based bypassing paths, as depicted in Figure 3. Each waveguide transmits 8 optical signals at different wavelengths."

They contain applications from different domains, which leads to various processing and communication requirements. We have selected six representative applications according to their parallelization level: i) FFT and Raytrace from Splash2 and ii) x264, Blackscholes, Barnes and Dedup from PARSEC. The execution of these applications on the architecture are simulated using the SNIPER manycore simulator [19]. We modified the Splash2 applications to allow their parallel executions and we modified SNIPER to handle the distribution of threads. It is possible to distribute applications on any number of clusters, which is suitable to explore the design space (see results section). Although the application mapping and the cluster partitioning lead to numerous design options, the results will only refer to scenario below due to space limitation.\nFigure 4.a illustrates the mappings of an application on four clusters, which leads to the use of four SWMR channels. Each used channel is configured to bypass disconnected readers (not illustrated in the figure for sake of clarity). Figure 4.b-e illustrate mappings on 6, 8, 9 and 12 clusters. Figure 4.f-g illustrate cluster partitioning for the parallel execution of two applications. From the simulation results, we extract the communication traces between L2 caches and the distributed L3, which corresponds to the traffic on the SWMR channels.

For this purpose, we first evaluate the loss of each channel used for 1x4 SWMR configuration and we report results in Figure 5. For SWMR0, the waveguide loss is as small as 0.28 dB due to the short distance between the writer (cluster 0) and the last connected reader (cluster 3). Since readers located after the last connected reader are not used, the\nMR through loss for ONoC with and without PCM is the same (1.41dB). The need to cross three directional couplers for the PCM-based channel leads to 0.48dB overhead compared to the channel without PCM. Channels 1 to 3 demonstrate higher waveguide propagation losses since the signals propagate through the entire waveguide. Since only three readers are connected, MR through loss for channels with PCM is the same as for SWMR0 (i.e. 1.41dB) while they reach 2.4 dB without PCM due to the need to cross all the MRRs in the intermediate readers. Finally, the losses induced by the directional couplers (3.56dB) lead to 1.4dB additional losses for the PCM based channel compared to channel without PCMs. To summarize, although PCMs allow reducing the MRR through loss when bypassing disconnected readers, the rather high insertion loss they involve lead to higher total losses. While PCM-based interconnect requires higher laser power, we will show in the following that significant power saving can be achieved thanks to significant reduction in the ring calibration power.\nFigure 6.a shows the power breakdown for previously discussed configuration and channels. For SWMR0, the power consumption is 1mW higher with PCM due to laser power overhead. Calibration power is the same with and without PCM since no reader is bypassed. For channels 1, 2 and 3, we obtain x5 reduction in the calibration power since only the connected readers require calibration. Overall, despite the 8mW increase in laser power, our approach leads to up to 52% power saving. As shown in .b, we obtain an average of 45% power saving per used channel power for 1x4 configuration. As the number of connected readers increases, lower power saving is obtained due to ring calibration requirements. Although configuration 4x4 leads to 6% power increase, our approach demonstrates a 21% power reduction on average. The higher energy efficiency of our approach for lower connectivity scenario ideally complements with the mapping of independent applications on the clusters, which we study in the following.\nFigure 6: Power consumption results: a) power breakdown per channel for 1x4 configuration and b) average power consumption per channel according to the network configurations."

The mapping of Blackscholes (Figure 7.a) on 4 clusters (resp. 16 clusters) leads to 1376ms (resp. 1188ms) execution time and 28W (resp. 120W) power consumption. By using all clusters in the architecture, a 15% speedup is achieved at the cost of x4.2 power increase. Configuration involving 4 clusters and 8 clusters lead to intermediate speedups and powers, which we will use to optimize the multi-applications mapping and the ONoC configuration. While all tested applications follow a similar trend, the actual speedup and power consumption highly depends on the parallelization level and the communication patterns. Using 4 clusters for FFT is preferable since 16 clusters lead to 3% speedup and 3.5x power overhead (Figure 7.e). On the other hand, the mapping of x264 on 16 clusters allows 60% speedup. To conclude, clusters partitioning, which is achieved by reconfiguring SWMR channels, can be optimized depending on the executed applications."

            "text": "We consider the execution of pairs of applications on the architecture. The baseline is a sequential execution of the two applications on all the clusters (denoted 1616 in Figure 8) connected using an ONoC without PCM. As reported in Figure 8.b, the baseline execution time for x264 and Blacksholes is 3663ms. We now consider the proposed PCM-based ONoC. PCMs allow to partition the architecture in order to allocate a dedicated number of clusters per application (see Figure 4.f for mapping details). Since readers which are not part of a SWMR channel partition are disconnected, the application tasks can be executed in parallel without any resources sharing, which contribute to reduce the execution time. As illustrated in Figure 8.b (case denoted 8/8 in the figure), the execution time is significantly reduced and reaches 2962ms. We then consider an uneven mapping of the application on the clusters (illustrated in Figure 4.g): 4/12 (resp. 12/4) allocates 4 (resp. 12) clusters to Blacksholes (resp. x264) and 12 (resp. 4) clusters to x264 (resp. Blacksholes). Mapping 12/4 leads to the best improvement in the execution time (26.8%). For the interconnect, SWMR channels are configured to connect only readers of interface executing the same application as the writer. Considering the 1.2Tb/s aggregated bandwidth of the optical interconnect (16 channels with 8 wavelengths at 10Gbps each), the baseline scenario would lead to a 2.7pJ/bit energy consumption under the assumption that all channels permanently transmit data. By considering the actual number of bits transmitted, we obtain a 47.7% energy per-bit reduction for the proposed ONoC compared to a network without PCM.

We carried out the same study for Blacksholes/Raytrace application pair, as reported in Figure 8.c. Interestingly, the best configuration is obtained by allocating 4 clusters to Blacksholes (against 12 in previous case), which is due to a lower computation load of Raytrace. Mapping 4/12 leads to 40.3% execution time reduction and 42.4% energy per bit reduction.\nFigure 8: a) Best mapping results and improvements compared to execution on 16 clusters, b-c) execution time for different mappings and ONoC configurations for Blacksholes/x264 and Blacksholes/Raytraces.\nFigure 8.a summarizes the best mapping we obtain for each application pair. Reductions in execution time and energy per bit reach up to 42% and 68.8% respectively for FFT /Blacksholes. Mappings involving Barnes lead to the lowest improvement since it is the least computation intensive application. No improvement is obtained when Barnes is combined with x264, which is the most data intensive application. This calls for finer grain mapping we will explore in our future works. On average, we obtain 21.6% execution time reduction and 41.2% per-bit energy reduction for the PCM-based ONoC. This validates the potential for PCMs to improve the on-chip optical communication energy efficiency and to facilitate partitioning of manycore.\nIn our last study, we evaluate the power required to change the state of PCMs during network reconfigurations. For this purpose, we first consider a pessimistic scenario in which the two applications with the smallest execution time, i.e. Barnes and Dedup, require full reconfiguration of the PCMs after each execution. The resulting 1.3Hz reconfiguration frequency would lead to 5\u00b5W, which is negligible considering the total system power consumption (100W). Nevertheless, the PCMs reconfiguration power and endurance can be improved by optimizing the remapping to take into account the current state of PCMs. This will be explored in our future works."

Configurability property of PCM allows to partition the architecture for parallel execution\nof applications which leads to reduction in execution time compared with sequential execution of applications on all 16 clusters. Results show that up to 52% static power reduction of the interconnect and 42% execution time reduction can be reached.
