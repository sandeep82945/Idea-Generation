    "abstractText": "Background Physiological characteristics of climbers have been extensively studied, while the personality of climbers remains poorly understood. Personality research in sports is an established field, predicting long-term success as well as short-term behavior. The goal of our study was to examine recreational climbers\u2019 personality and gain a better understanding of what makes them reach new heights. Methods We analyzed a cohort of 50 recreational climbers and 50 non-climbing athletes (control) regarding their personality characteristics. We assessed the BMI, the self-reported climbing grade, and the years of climbing experience. To evaluate the personality of recreational climbers and athletes, we used the German version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI-2), which summarizes the personality in five main categories. Results Recreational climbers scored significantly higher in conscientiousness than non-climbing athletes (p = 0.04), there was no significant difference between the other four main personality traits. Female climbers scored significantly higher in conscientiousness than male climbers (p = 0.02), while female athletes scored higher in openness than male athletes (p < 0.01). The climbing group displayed a small but significant negative correlation between conscientiousness and BMI (r = -0.39; p < 0.01). Conclusion In conclusion, the personality of recreational climbers and recreational athletes differs in conscientiousness, with the climbers showing higher scores. Regarding gender, we found higher levels of conscientiousness in female climbers and higher openness in female athletes in comparison to their male counterparts. A negative correlation between BMI and conscientiousness of the climbers was detected.",

We assessed the BMI, the self-reported climbing grade, and the years of climbing experience. To evaluate the personality of recreational climbers and athletes, we used the German version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI-2), which summarizes the personality in five main categories.\nResults Recreational climbers scored significantly higher in conscientiousness than non-climbing athletes (p = 0.04), there was no significant difference between the other four main personality traits. Female climbers scored significantly higher in conscientiousness than male climbers (p = 0.02), while female athletes scored higher in openness than male athletes (p < 0.01). The climbing group displayed a small but significant negative correlation between conscientiousness and BMI (r = -0.39; p < 0.01). Conclusion In conclusion, the personality of recreational climbers and recreational athletes differs in conscientiousness, with the climbers showing higher scores. Regarding gender, we found higher levels of conscientiousness in female climbers and higher openness in female athletes in comparison to their male counterparts. A negative correlation between BMI and conscientiousness of the climbers was detected.\nKeywords Sports psychology, Sports climbing, Climbing psychology, Climbing\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022, corrected publication 2023.

            "text": "After last year\u2019s successful debut at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, sports climbing is continuing to gain popularity [1, 2]. With this increase in popularity, it can be assumed that the number of recreational athletes will continue to grow. This trend is already observed in an outdoor industry report showing a trend of increased participation in outdoor climbing activities [3]. Another statistic survey done by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) highlights a steady increase in indoor climbing and indoor bouldering\n*Correspondence: Gino Steinmetz Gino.Steinmetz@med.uni-goettingen.de 1 Department of Occupational and Social Medicine, Georg-AugustUniversity of Goettingen, Robert-Koch-Stra\u00dfe 40, 37075 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany 2 Department of Trauma, Orthopedics and Reconstructive Surgery, Georg-August-University of Goettingen, 37075 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany 3 Division of Orthopaedics, Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, 20521 Hamburg, Germany 4 Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester 55901, MN, USA\nparticipation in the population of the US [4]. Climbing offers a wide variety of subdisciplines, with rock climbing, indoor sports climbing, speed climbing, bouldering and ice climbing being the fundamental ones [1]. Throughout literature, advanced climbers are well studied, but there is still a lack of focus on the recreational climber [1, 5\u20137]. Mental aspects as well as the relationship between physical and mental aspects of climbing is likewise scarcely covered within the literature. It is well established that in climbing, psychology plays a major role in performance, however there is a strong disproportion between research focusing on the physical against the mental aspect of sports climbing [1]. Only the risk-taking behavior in high-risk sports is a well-researched topic [8, 9]. Llewellyn et\u00a0 al. provide a focused look at the correlation between self-efficacy and risk taking in recreational sports climbers [10]. The authors found that climbers, even recreational ones, high in self-efficacy engaged more frequent in medium and high-risk forms of rock climbing, although the underlying mechanisms remained unclear.\nVarious experimental designs are used to examine personality in sports. One widely used is the comparison of high-level sportsmen versus low-level sportsmen [11]. Current research suggests that high performance athletes express a lower level of neuroticism [12]. A recent crucial finding is that long-term success in sports, as well as short-term behavior can be predicted by personality traits [13]. In summary, the conjunction of sports und personality continues to arouse interest, however specific research for sports climbing and personality in the recreational climber has not been conducted extensively so far. The climber\u2019s personality in general is largely studied on at least advanced climbers: The advanced climber is described as being high in vigor and mental endurance as well as low in tension, depression, anger, confusion and mood disturbance [1, 6], which is also known as the \u201cIceberg\u201d-profile [14]. While there is ample research displaying the differences in personality traits between genders, there is hardly any description of the gender differences in recreational athletes [15, 16].\nWith the current lack of focus on recreational climbers as well as gender differences, the aim of this study was to identify personality traits associated with recreational climbers using the Big Five factor model."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "This is, to our knowledge, the first study comparing the personality traits of 50 recreational climbers with 50 athletes of other sports as well as providing an in-depth look at gender differences in personality between recreational sportsmen. The characteristics of both groups were comparable to similar studies [24\u201326]. The aim of this study was to examine the differences in personality between recreational climbers and recreational athletes. A secondary analysis assessed differences between genders of both groups as well as intra-group differences between genders. Recreational climbers scored significantly higher in conscientiousness than matched athletes. We additionally show significant differences in openness between genders of our cohort.\nIn-depth analyses of climber\u2019s personality are exceedingly rare. Personality traits of athletes however are well described with the Big Five Inventory [24, 27, 28]. In the present study, we found that conscientiousness is significantly higher in recreational climbers compared to regular athletes. We did not find a significant difference in the remaining four personality traits between both groups. This confirmed our initial hypothesis of a prevalent\nhigher conscientiousness in climbing athletes. A possible explanation lies within the nature of climbing as a potentially fatal sport: A higher emphasis on conscientiousness in the participating parties may be lifesaving in certain situations\u2014although an evolutionary advantage of this is not and cannot be proven today. Apart from risking one\u2019s own life, securing your partner on the climbing route is crucial, which may lead to a higher conscientiousness in recreational climbers. In line with that, Malinauskas et\u00a0al. compared athletes to non-athletes in a similar setup using the NEO Five-Factor inventory (NEO-FFI), which is a commercial tool to assess the five personality dimensions. The NEO-FFI is comparable to the BFI-2 that was used in the present study. Malinauskas et\u00a0 al. showed a significant difference between athletes and non-athletes in conscientiousness [24]. Since all of our participants were recreational athletes of some sport, a direct comparison with this study does not seem feasible. In addition, Malinauskas et\u00a0al. only recruited male participants. In comparison to athletes, we found that recreational climbers scored significantly higher in conscientiousness. One factor could have been the inclusion of female participants in our study, since female climbers additionally scored higher in conscientiousness than their male counterparts.\nIn elite alpine climbers ascending Mount Everest, higher levels of extraversion, psychoticism and lower level of neuroticism were found by Egan and Stelmack in comparison to the normative standardization data for males in the 31\u201340-year age range from the test manual. In recreational climbers, we could not reproduce\nthese findings compared to recreational athletes, while the recreational nature of our participants might be the reason [29]. Burnik et\u00a0 al. compared male Slovenian climbers, with at least one alpinistic expedition to the Himalayas, to male non-athletes who never climbed with the Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI 114). The FPI 114 is a commercially available questionnaire to assess the personality traits in subjects; it subdivides personality in 9 subdivisions. Burnik et\u00a0al. did not find differences in extraversion, but found that climbers showed lower levels of neuroticism compared to the control group [25]. Likewise, we did not find a significant difference in extraversion between both groups, but in our cohort no significant difference in neuroticism was found. Burniks study solely focused on male climbers while we also recruited female climbers. This might be one of the reasons for the lack of difference. The fact that the participants of this study were all athletes in some sport might also provide an explanation.\nBrandauer found that male climbers had higher depression scales compared to female climbers [30]. Depression is a common mental disorder with a global proportion of 4.4% and is more common in females (5.1%) than males (3.6%) according to estimates of the World Health Organization [31]. Although neuroticism is not linearly linked to depression, common gene variants are presumed since high values can predict later depression [32]. We could not find sex-specific differences in neuroticism, while the base values were low in athletes and climbers. Both groups in our study scored lower than the standardization data in the test manual. The positive effect of climbing and sports on depression is well studied and the low overall values of neuroticism in our groups seem to confirm this effect [33\u201336]. Additional research by Piepiora et\u00a0 al. shows no significant link between the level of focus and the ability to overcome the fear of falling during a competition. The study reveals that there is a high correlation between climbers\u2019 ability to focus and a high level sports performance [37]. While we were not able to find a correlation between self-reported climbing grade and personality traits, further research might offer insights and demonstrate the differences between recreational and highly advanced climbers. In a similar setup to our study, Marczak and Ginszt compared 30 male and 30 female sports climbers finding that male climbers scored significantly higher in openness as well as agreeableness while there was no significant difference in neuroticism, extraversion and conscientiousness [26]. We encountered opposing results in our study, with the female climbers showing significantly higher conscientiousness and insignificantly higher agreeableness than their male counterparts. One reason might have been the age of 23 \u00b1 1\u00a0years in the cohort of Marczak et\u00a0 al., while our cohort was\nolder (30.3 \u00b1 12.7\u00a0 years) and slightly more experienced (6.8 vs. 6\u00a0 years of climbing experience). In our athlete group, the female participants also showed significantly higher openness. According to a recent study by Giolla et\u00a0al., there is a correlation between the gender equality index, in which Germany ranks high, and the sex differences in personalities, showing that a higher gender equality leads to more pronounced differences in personalities [38].\nIn the climbing group, we found a significant negative correlation between conscientiousness and the BMI of the climbers, which shows that with increasing BMI, the level of conscientiousness of the individuals decreased. While there is currently no research examining the correlation between BMI and personality in climbers, there is ample evidence suggesting BMI does correlate with certain personality types in general. Sutin and Terracciano found in a cross-sectional study with a diverse sample of participants living in the United States (50% female) that high neuroticism was associated with a higher BMI, while conscientiousness was protective of a higher BMI [39]. Comparing these findings with our results, we found a higher conscientiousness correlating with a lower BMI in recreational climbers, although we could not find a correlation between neuroticism and BMI. Our population was, in general, healthy and sports enthusiastic, climbing 2.5 \u00b1 1.2 times a week, which could account for these differences. Gerlach et\u00a0 al. published a review in 2015 where the group categorized conscientiousness and selfcontrol as protective factors towards weight gain [39]. In the climbing group we assessed a BMI of 22.0 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0 kg/ m2, which is categorized as a healthy weight, and we also found a negative correlation between BMI and conscientiousness. Gerlach et\u00a0 al. postulates that conscientiousness is associated with self-discipline [39].\nOur findings show that recreational climbers score higher in conscientiousness, with female climbers outvaluing their male counterparts. This might point to higher levels of self-discipline in recreational climbers, especially in the female climbers, in comparison to common athletes. Research of personality and the differences between genders in athletes is uncommon. With growing popularity of climbing sports, further research on recreational climbers and gender differences between personalities is warranted."
