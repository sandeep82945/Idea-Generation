    "abstractText": "Cistanche deserticola residues are by-products of the industrial production of Cistanche deserticola, which are currently often discarded, resulting in the waste of resources. In order to achieve the efficient utilization of Cistanche deserticola, dietary fiber from Cistanche deserticola residues was extracted chemically and the optimization of the extraction conditions was performed, using the response surface methodology to study the effects of the NaOH concentration, extraction temperature, extraction time, and solid\u2013liquid ratio on the yield of water-soluble dietary fiber (SDF). The structural, physicochemical, and functional properties of the dietary fiber were also investigated. The results showed that the optimal conditions were as follows: NaOH concentration of 3.7%, extraction temperature of 71.7 \u25e6C, extraction time of 89.5 min, and solid\u2013liquid ratio of 1:34. The average yield of SDF was 19.56%, which was close to the predicted value of 19.66%. The two dietary fiber types had typical polysaccharide absorption peaks and typical type I cellulose crystal structures, and the surface microstructures of the two dietary fiber types were different, with the surface of SDF being looser and more porous. Both dietary fiber types had good functional properties, with SDF having the strongest water-holding capacity and the strongest adsorption capacity for nitrite, cholesterol, sodium cholate, and glucose, while IDF had a better oil-holding capacity. These results suggest that Cistanche deserticola residues are a good source of dietary fiber and have promising applications in the functional food processing industry.",

            "text": "Cistanche deserticola is a traditional and valuable Chinese herbal medicine with high edible value that grows mainly in the desert areas of Northwest China [1]. Cistanche deserticola contains phenylethanol glycosides, polysaccharides, and flavonoids [2\u20134], giving it antiinflammatory and antioxidant functions, improved immunity, and other pharmacological effects [5,6]. In recent years, as individuals\u2019 concerns for their health have increased, more products derived from Cistanche cistannii have been developed, such as Cistanche cistannii wine and Cistanche cistannii beverages, and the production of Cistanche cistannii products has increased annually [7\u20139]. In industrial production, large amounts of Cistanche deserticola residues are generated, which are usually discarded, but these residues are rich in dietary fiber, thus representing a considerable waste of resources if discarded. Making full use of these residues can increase the added value of Cistanchis resources and improve the economic benefits. Dietary fiber (DF) is a class of carbohydrate that is not digested and absorbed by endogenous enzymes in the human body [10]. In recent years, studies have shown that the adequate intake of dietary fiber can help to reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases, gastric and intestinal cancers, and other\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7604. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28227604 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nchronic diseases [11\u201313]. DF is classified into water-soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and waterinsoluble dietary fiber (IDF) according to its solubility and its different physiological functions, based on its composition and structure [14]. SDF is composed of non-cellulosic polysaccharides, including \u03b2-glucan, pectin, guar gum, arabinoxylan, inulin, etc. [15]. It has the effects of lowering blood lipids, lowering blood glucose, and preventing gastric cancer, etc. [16]. IDF is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, chitosan, lignin, and other components of the plant cell wall [17], and it can increase the volume of fecal matter and accelerate the speed of intestinal transport [18]. DF is increasingly widely used in the food industry due to its unique physicochemical properties and functional properties, such as its water-holding capacity (WHC), oil-holding capacity (OHC), and other properties that contribute to its role in improving the organoleptic properties and processing characteristics of foods after it is added as an additive or nutrient fortification agent [19]. At present, dietary fiber is mainly used in foods such as pasta products, dairy products, meat products, and beverages [20]. Typically, SDF has higher value than IDF because of its better functional properties. Raw materials with SDF content comprising more than 10% of the DF can be considered high-quality sources of dietary fiber. Much of the DF currently used in the food industry has relatively low SDF content, so researchers are seeking high-quality sources of dietary fiber [21]. The chemical method of obtaining DF includes drying and crushing the raw materials, using acidic and alkaline reagents, and obtaining DF under suitable conditions [22]. The principle is to remove the proteins and fats in the raw materials using acidic and alkaline reagents so that the glycosidic bond breaks to produce a new reducing end, reducing the polymerization of fiber macromolecules, and converting them into non-digestible soluble polysaccharides. This method is suitable for large-scale application due to its simple operation and low cost [23]. Currently, there are no reports on the study of dietary fiber in Cistanchis dregs. The objective of this study is to optimize the process conditions for the chemical extraction of SDF from Cistanchis dregs using response surface optimization. By determining the structural characteristics and physicochemical and functional properties of SDF, IDF, and the raw residue of Cistanchis dregs, a theoretical basis for the utilization of Cistanchis resources and the application of dietary fiber in the food industry is provided."

The design of the experimental factor levels is shown in Table 1.\nA total of 29 sets of tests were conducted, and the results are shown in Table 2.

The results show that the correlation coefficient of the model, R2 = 0.9709, was close to that of the R2adj of 0.9419, and both were close to 1, indicating that this model was well fitted. The p-value was <0.0001, the coefficient of variation (C.V.%) of the model was 2.78% (<5%), and the out-of-fit term was 0.1445, indicating that the model could predict the SDF yield accurately. The results of the significance analysis of the coefficients of the regression model in Table 3 show that the primary coefficients X1, X2, X3, and X4; the interaction term coefficients X1 X2 and X2 X3; and the quadratic coefficients X12, X22, X32, and X42 had a significant effect on the SDF yield.\n2.1.2. Response Surface Analysis\nThe 3D response surface plots generated by the model are shown in Figure 1A\u2013F. The response surface allowed us to examine the degree of influence of each factor on the SDF yield. The different slopes of the response surfaces indicate that the interaction terms had different effects on the SDF yield of Cistanche deserticola residues; the greater the slope of the interaction surface, the higher the degree of its effect. The response surface and the ANOVA of the regression model showed that the order of the four factors by effect on\nthe SDF yield was as follows: NaOH concentration > extraction temperature > extraction time > solid\u2013liquid ratio. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the NaOH concentration and extraction temperature and a significant interaction between the extraction temperature and extraction time.\nC.V. % 2.78 * Significant at p < 0.05. ** Significant at p < 0.01.\n2.1.3. Optimization of Parameters and Verification of the Model\nAccording to the results of the response surface analysis, the optimal extraction conditions for SDF were as follows: NaOH concentration of 3.7%, extraction temperature of 71.7 \u25e6C, extraction time of 89.5 min, and solid\u2013liquid ratio of 1:34. Under these optimal conditions, the maximum predicted value of the SDF yield was 19.66%. Thus, a validation experiment was conducted with these conditions and the experiment was repeated three times, resulting in an average SDF yield of 19.56%, which was not significantly different from the predicted value. This showed that the response surface optimization experiment was effective and the established regression equation model was reasonable, being suitable for predicting the extraction rate of MI-SDF."

All three exhibited a gentle and broad crystalline peak near 2\u03b8 = 20\u25e6, which indicates that they had a predominantly amorphous structure in the crystalline region, which is typical of type I cellulose [30].

The low crystallinity of the SDF indicated that the original crystalline region of the molecule had been destroyed, the degree of polymerization had been reduced, and the surface structure was looser, which explained the high adsorption capacity of the SDF from the side [32].

Composition of Monosaccharides The monosaccharide compositions of the SDF and the IDF from Cistanche deserticola residues are shown in Table 4, with seven monosaccharides detected in SDF and eight in IDF. The most prominent monosaccharide in both dietary fiber types was glucose, which is mainly derived from cellulose in the cell wall. The glucose content of the IDF was higher than that of the SDF, which could be attributed to the alkaline conditions that promoted the hydrolysis of cellulose in the cell wall to glucose, as well as glucose oligosaccharides and dextrins, which were composed of glucose units. Meanwhile, the SDF contained more arabinose, galactose, and rhamnose than the IDF, which suggested the presence of pectin substances and soluble polysaccharides produced by the hydrolysis of cellulose or hemicellulose in the SDF. Some studies have shown that polysaccharides containing arabinose and rhamnose could lower blood glucose levels and regulate lipid metabolism and other physiological activities, so SDF may have better hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties than IDF [33,34]."

In addition, the WHC was related to the amount of hydrophilic groups exposed\u2014the more hydrophilic groups that were exposed, the higher the water absorption was [34]. Meanwhile, the OHC of the IDF was higher than that of the SDF. This was because the OHC of DF is positively correlated with the lignin content, which was higher in the IDF. In addition, the surface characteristics, the total charge density, and the hydrophobicity also increased the OHC of the IDF [35].

The optimal conditions were as follows: NaOH concentration of 3.7%, extraction temperature of 71.7 \u25e6C, extraction time of 89.5 min, and solid\u2013liquid ratio of 1:34. The average yield of SDF was 19.56%. The structure and adsorption properties of the dietary fiber were also investigated. Both dietary fiber types studied had typical polysaccharide absorption peaks and a typical cellulose crystal structure of type I. The surface microstructures of the SDF and IDF were different, with the surface of the SDF being looser and more porous. The two dietary fiber types had different monosaccharide compositions, with glucose being the main component in both. The SDF\u2019s water-holding capacity, the adsorption of nitrite and cholesterol under acidic conditions, and the adsorption of sodium cholate and glucose were stronger than those of the CK and IDF. The oil-holding capacity of the IDF was the highest. In summary, the dietary fiber in Cistanche deserticola residues has good water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, and adsorption capacity, and it has application prospects in the functional food processing industry. On this basis, functional foods with hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effects could be developed, such as chewable tablets.\nAuthor Contributions: Z.S. conducted the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
