    "abstractText": "Currently, ketamine is used in treating multiple pain, mental health, and substance abuse disorders due to rapid-acting analgesic and antidepressant effects. Its limited short-term durability has motivated research into the potential synergistic actions between ketamine and psychotherapy to sustain benefits. This systematic review on ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) summarizes existing evidence regarding present-day practices. Through rigorous review, seventeen articles that included 603 participants were identified. From available KAP publications, it is apparent that combined treatments can, in specific circumstances, initiate and prolong clinically significant reductions in pain, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, while encouraging rapport and treatment engagement, and promoting abstinence in patients addicted to other substances. Despite much variance in how KAP is applied (route of ketamine administration, ketamine dosage/frequency, psychotherapy modality, overall treatment length), these findings suggest psychotherapy, provided before, during, and following ketamine sessions, can maximize and prolong benefits. Additional large-scale randomized control trials are warranted to understand better the mutually influential relationships between psychotherapy and ketamine in optimizing responsiveness and sustaining long-term benefits in patients with chronic pain. Such investigations will assist in developing standardized practices and maintenance programs.",

Along with the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, there has been a tremendous widening of the definition of depression and an impressive decrease in the difference in efficacy between placebo and drug and controlled studies.1 The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression Study found that response rates to new compounds after the failure of the first antidepressant are low.1\u20133 This delay in onset is a significant drawback to current antidepressant therapies, leaving a crucial need for the development of faster-acting antidepressants, especially in patients at risk of suicide. Furthermore, estimates from the National Institute of Mental Health indicate that the prevalence of major depressive disorder is 6.4% of the US adult population.4 Despite intense research efforts, the field has had little success in developing antidepressant treatments with fundamentally novel mechanisms of action over the past six decades, leaving the field wary and skeptical about any new developments.3 Nonetheless, several small proof-ofconcept studies conducted over the past 15 years have gradually gained interest by displaying strong evidence that therapies associated with ketamine have provided a unique, rapid onset of sustained but temporally limited therapeutic effect.3\nJournal of Pain Research 2022:15 1691\u20131706 1691 \u00a9 2022 Drozdz et al.

Introduced in 1962,5 preliminary findings indicated potent anesthetic-analgesic properties and unique alterations of consciousness at variable dosages.6 Ketamine is now commonly used as an anesthetic in human medicine and an analgesic agent in multiple pain conditions.2,7 Although the mechanisms that contribute to symptom reductions are unclear,3,8,9 several neural mechanisms are proposed: a) the dampening of certain functional brain connections; b) enhanced synaptogenesis; c) glutamate modulation; and d) increases in neuroplasticity.4,10\u201313 In animal models, acute ketamine administration has been shown to activate several downstream signalling cascades that include the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), and elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, which have been implicated in neuroplasticity mechanisms and the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.4,10,11,13 The fundamental property of ketamine as a use-dependent blocker of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission suggests that this compound\u2019s cellular and behavioural effects are triggered by suppression of a tonically active form glutamatergic signalling in the brain.4 A prevailing hypothesis posits that ketamine-induced suppression of tonic NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic input onto GABA-ergic interneurons leads to a decrease in overall inhibition, also called disinhibition, tilting the balance of synaptic transmission toward excitation.4 Overall, it appears that on a microscopic scale, synaptic excitation and neuronal structural plasticity afforded from ketamine administration plays a significant role in the medication\u2019s rapid and robust effectiveness in chronic mental health conditions, including substance use disorders and chronic pain.2,8,9,14 Unfortunately, symptom reductions are frequently transient, typically lasting 4\u20137 days. Thus, repeated administrations are required to maintain positive effects.15\u201317\nOne possible aid in prolonging ketamine\u2019s effects is psychotherapy. Psychotherapy describes the treatment of psychological disorders or symptoms through the promotion of personal growth, symptom management, and wellbeing and is based on therapeutic structures, principles, and techniques.18 Separately, both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have shown equal efficacy, while the combination of both approaches has been found to be more effective in the treatment of psychological disorders than psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy alone; specifically, in certain populations including older adults and patients with comorbid medical disorders.18 The potential for ketamine to facilitate psychotherapy was first reported by Khorramzadeh and Lotfy (as an abreactive agent),19 and subsequently by Fontana as a pharmacological component of antidepressant psychotherapy.20 Ketamine-enhanced psychotherapy has since been trialed as a treatment for multiple conditions including chronic neuropathic pain,21 opioid tapering,22 major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and substance use disorders (SUD).23 While disagreement exists amongst researchers and clinicians about how ketamine facilitates psychotherapy, some theories about ketamine\u2019s interactions with psychotherapy suggest a facilitation of emotional learning through enhanced neuroplasticity, evocations of emotionally arousing phenomenological experiences, reductions in defensiveness, and enhanced treatment adherence and engagement.24\u201328 Additionally, while some researchers and practitioners work to minimize the psychedelic effects of ketamine,22,29,30 some studies suggest that the presence of a psychedelic experiences fosters enhanced benefits, and may improve mental health and well-being. The transpersonal experience of ketamine may bring on new perspectives, stimulate critical reframing, and offer personal insights to clients.23,28,31,32 These findings parallel the relationship between psychedelic experience and treatment outcome in psilocybin studies.23 The overarching goal of linking psychotherapy with psychedelics such as MDMA and psilocybin, and more recently, ketamine, is to augment the effects of the psychotherapy through conscious awareness.23 The development of psychotherapy that uses ketamine as medicine for conscious awareness is new and groundbreaking.23 The theorized effectiveness of ketamine in psychotherapy is based on: (a) increased access to traumatic memory via enhanced synaptic connectivity; (b) decreased central sensitization via downregulation of the prefrontal cortex, and (c) enhanced extinction of previously paired pain-related memories.21 Therefore, KAP can utilize a dosage escalation strategy to achieve different levels of trance, increasing to full out-of-body experiences.23\nWhile the published literature on Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) and the use of the intervention has grown substantially in recent years, there has yet to be a systematic review of the available evidence.

An information specialist from the Health Science Library at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, Canada, in collaboration with the authors, designed and conducted a systematic search of Embase, Pubmed/Medline, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Psychiatry Online to identify all English language articles published from 1973 to November, 2021.\nFigure 1 summarizes the search strategy used for study selection. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)33 guidelines for reporting our search. Studies were included if they reported on original data and/or described the short-term or long-term effects of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy on pain, mental health, and/or addiction. Articles were excluded if they involved animal subjects; and/or focused on recreational ketamine abuse/use.\nThe search used a combination of the following keywords: \u201cKetamine\u201d OR \u201cKetamine assisted psychotherapy\u201d OR \u201cKetamine-enhanced psychotherapy\u201d AND \u201cChronic pain\u201d OR \u201cTreatment resistant\u201d OR \u201cMood disorder\u201d OR \u201cAnxiety disorder\u201d OR \u201cPsychotherapy\u201d OR \u201cCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\u201d OR \u201cAcceptance and Commitment Therapy\u201d OR \u201cMindfulness-based intervention (MBI)\u201d OR \u201cAlcoholism\u201d OR \u201cOpioid withdrawal\u201d OR \u201cAddiction\u201d OR \u201cPosttraumatic stress disorder\u201d OR \u201cDepression\u201d OR \u201cObsessive-compulsive disorder\u201d OR \u201cNeuropathic pain\u201d.\nTwo-hundred and fifty-five articles were identified. Two researchers (MM and SD) independently screened the 255 titles and abstracts for relevance based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Abstracts were excluded if they did not include both ketamine and psychotherapy; did not contain original data; included preclinical animal models; did not have abstracts available in English; and did not specify a pain, substance abuse, or mental health condition. This resulted in 87 full-text articles that were retrieved for detailed examination. After review, a further 70 articles were deemed not relevant (Figure 1), leaving 17 articles for data extraction. The reference lists of the 17 full-text articles were reviewed for additional papers. Any discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consultation with the senior author (KL).\nFor each included study, the following variables were extracted: (a) study design; (b) sample size; (c) participant demographics; (d) ketamine dosage and dose frequency; (f) ketamine delivery method; (g) psychotherapy type; (h)\nJournal of Pain Research 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S360733 DovePress 1693\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\npsychotherapy frequency; (i) temporal relationship between ketamine administration and psychotherapy; (j) primary outcomes; and (k) duration of outcomes. Given the heterogeneity of study designs and underlying diagnoses treated, a narrative synthesis was most appropriate. The results were subdivided by description of intervention and the effectiveness and duration of treatment (to encompass the methodology and results reported in the included studies). Risk of bias was not formally assessed given the purpose of this review was an exploration of standard practices and outcomes in KAP, rather than an evaluation of the quality of individual studies. For the purposes of this review, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is defined as psychotherapy provided either before, concurrently, and/or after ketamine administration."

In relation to frequency of administration, six studies investigated a single session of ketamine administration, five involved multiple ketamine sessions (with one study administering five 10mg IN doses of ketamine in each ketamine session), three studies implemented a mixed method (single or multiple ketamine sessions), and two studies that administered a single continuous infusion over 5 days. These results are summarized in Figure 3 and Table 1.\nAcross all 17 studies there was considerable variability in ketamine dosage. Of the 11 studies, which administered ketamine intravenously, seven administered ketamine at 0.5mg/kg. Of these 7 studies, four administered 0.5mg/kg of IV ketamine during a single ketamine session; one study had 3 ketamine sessions; one study had 4 ketamine sessions; and one study had 6 ketamine sessions. One IV ketamine study administered 0.71mg/kg infusion of ketamine during one or two ketamine sessions; one IV ketamine study administered a single 0.6mg/kg infusion; one IV ketamine study administered a single continuous dose of ketamine over 5 days, starting at 2\u03bcg/kg/min and increasing by 1\u20132\u03bcg/kg/ min every 3\u20134 hours to a maximum of 11\u201315\u03bcg/kg/min; and one IV ketamine study administered two separate 5-day continuous infusions of ketamine, with each continuous session separated by 6-months; starting at 0.09mg/kg/h titrated up by 10mg/kg to a maximum of 0.77mg/kg/h. A total of 3 studies administered IM ketamine, one study delivering 0.2mg/kg or 2.0mg/kg of IM ketamine; one study delivering 2.0mg/kg of IM ketamine during a single or multiple (3) ketamine sessions; and one study delivering 25mg of IM ketamine during a single or multiple (2) ketamine sessions. One study delivered multiple (1\u201325) IM and SL ketamine sessions as part of clinical practice, administered an average of 80\u2013 90mg of IM ketamine and an average of 200\u2013250mg of SL ketamine. One study delivered 150mg of SL ketamine over 4 ketamine sessions.

SL and/or IM ketamine was administered to patients, with doses titrated in office and then adjusted for home-use. Patients were started on SL ketamine in office to induce a trance state with respect to dosage so patients could replicate the effect at home if needed. Afterwards, IM ketamine was administered in-office with the clinician providing a safe and warm environment and guided psychotherapy during KAP sessions. A minimum of 2 therapists were present during the inoffice KAP session(s) and subsequent monitoring, with each session lasting up to 3 hours. Home-use dosing was SL, lower dosing, and often unsupervised. On average, KAP sessions were held in-office roughly 2 weeks apart, where psychotherapy was offered concurrently with IM ketamine. Patients were sometimes prescribed SL ketamine for home use and were encouraged to replicate the setting and procedure as demonstrated by the clinician. Patients were given instructions for SL ketamine dosing, and told not to exceed more than 6 at home sessions over a two-week period. The frequency of psychotherapy was determined based on patient diagnosis and the severity of presenting difficulties. The results showed significant decreases in anxiety and depression scores as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The most significant improvements were seen in those with developmental trauma (complex PTSD), severe depression, and in those who received more ketamine-assisted psychotherapy sessions."

Participants received an initial CBT session 24\u201348 hours following the first IV ketamine (0.05mg/kg) session. Ketamine and CBTwas provided twice weekly on different days over 2 weeks, with additional weekly sessions of CBT administered for another 8 weeks. Of the eight (50%) participants who responded to the ketamine infusions, seven achieved a remission of symptoms. Among the remitters, four of seven did so after the initial infusion, whereas two did so after the second infusion, and one patient did so after the fourth infusion. By the end of the study (10 weeks post-infusion), five of the eight responders relapsed with a median relapse time of 12 weeks from remission.\nIn their subsequent 2021 randomized controlled trial, Wilkinson et al35 administered 6 IV ketamine (0.5mg/kg over 40 min) sessions over the course of 3 weeks to 42 severely depressed patients. Of the 42 subjects, 28 (66.7%) achieved a response to ketamine as defined as a >50% improvement in depression severity by the end of the last ketamine session. The 28 ketamine responders were randomized into either a CBT or treatment as usual (TAU) groups for an additional 14 weeks. Those in the TAU group (n=14) attended a visit with the study physician every 1\u20132 weeks, focusing on medication management and management of adverse events. Those in the CBT group (n=14) received CBT twice weekly for 2 weeks, then once weekly for the remaining 12 weeks. They found a significant difference in MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Sale (MADRS) scores, and a significant interaction effect of time-by-treatment group as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) scores from baseline to week 17 (fourteen weeks after the last ketamine infusion), finding greater sustained improvements in the CBT group.\nBecker28 presented case reports of two female participants. Case 1 was diagnosed with MDD comorbid with an Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS), and received two concurrent ketamine and psychotherapy sessions resulting in normalized caloric intake and improvements in treatment engagement and adherence. Case 2 had a diagnosis of BPD-I with a current depressive episode and received a single concurrent ketamine and psychotherapy session that resulted in immediate (next day) improvements in depressive symptoms that were sustained at the 2-month follow-up. Though the duration of effect was not reported for Case 1, both women reported an increased capacity to make effective use of psychological insight facilitated by the KAP experience.\nJournal of Pain Research 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S360733 DovePress 1697\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

All subjects experienced reductions in PTSD scores as measured by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PLC) and the Clinically Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) at 24 hours with no significant differences between groups. However, participants in the ketamine group had a greater duration of sustained response (34.44 \u00b1 19.12 days) when compared to placebo (16.50 \u00b1 11.39 days).\nSimilarly, Duek et al39 randomized 17 participants diagnosed with PTSD and undergoing prolonged exposure therapy to either receive a single ketamine or midazolam infusion over 40 minutes. Subjects underwent 7 daily exposure sessions, receiving the infusion after the first exposure session. Both groups experienced significantly reduced PTSD scores at the 30-day follow-up with no significant differences between groups; however, individuals in the ketamine group reported less severe PTSD symptoms than the midazolam group at 90-days. The significance values of the reduction in PTSD symptoms at the 90-day follow-up are missing from this conference abstract.\nHalstead et al40 examined a case of a female patient with PTSD comorbid with persistent depressive disorder (PDD) related to racial discrimination. The patient initially received a preparatory psychotherapy session to develop goals and be taught self-regulation techniques to assist with the ketamine experience. During dosing sessions, the patient received ketamine lozenges (150mg) which were held in the mouth for 10 minutes before swallowing. Psychotherapy was provided concurrently during the dosing session. This was followed by an integration session where the psychotherapist worked with the patient to integrate ketamine-induced insights into daily life. Integration sessions also followed the second, third, and fourth dosing sessions. Following multiple sublingual doses of ketamine administered in combination with Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) over a 13 days scores on the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory decreased at 2-weeks, which was maintained up to a 6-month follow-up. In addition to self-reported reductions in anxiety following treatment, severe depression scores on the BDI-II decreased from baseline to the 2-week time point, but returned to severe levels at the 6-month follow-up.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S360733 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2022:151698\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nShiroma et al41 investigated the feasibility of integrating multiple (3) ketamine infusions with standardized prolonged exposure therapy for 12 veterans with chronic PTSD.

Up to 7 additional psychotherapy sessions were provided on a weekly basis. Ten veterans completed treatment, and the 4-month follow-up demonstrated a significant decrease in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by PLC-5 and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CDI-S) scale following treatment. After controlling for mean changes in the MADRS depression scores over time, changes in total PLC-5 scores and PLC-5 Avoidance remained significant.

Both groups received 10 hours of psychotherapy prior to ketamine administration to prepare patients for a ketamine-induced psychedelic experience, emphasizing how the experience should allow them to realize the negative effects of heroin abuse and promote a life without drugs; implying that the process has the ability to modify their value systems, notions of self, and facilitate changes in personality. One 1.5\u20132-hour psychotherapy session was then administered concurrently with a single\nJournal of Pain Research 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S360733 DovePress 1699\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nlow-dose (0.2mg/kg) or high-dose (2.0mg/kg) of IM ketamine. Soothing instrumental music was played during the ketamine-induced psychotherapy session, and the content of the session was based on the individual subjects\u2019 case history. An additional 5 hours of psychotherapy was administered within several days following the ketaminepsychotherapy session, with aim to integrate insights from the ketamine experience into daily life. Subjects were then discharged from inpatient care within 3\u20135 days following the ketamine-psychotherapy session. At the 24-month followup, participants were assessed for abstinence from heroin by reports from the subjects and their families, and confirmed by urine tests. Individuals assigned to the high-dose group reported higher rates of abstinence and lower rates of relapse when compared to the low-dose group. The differences between abstinence and relapse rates between groups were significant from the first month almost to the 24-month follow-up; with the exclusion of month 7 and 8. Both high and low-dose groups reported significantly reduced cravings for heroin as evaluated by the Visual Analog Scale of Cravings, with greater reductions experienced by the high-dose group immediately after the psychotherapy-ketamine sessions, and at the 1 and 3-month post psychotherapy-ketamine follow-up. The high-dose group reported reductions in cravings at the 24-month follow-up but not the low-dose group. Additional data collected on anxiety and depression, as measured by the Spielberger Anxiety Scale and the Zung Depression Scale, respectively, revealed that the high and low-dose groups both experienced reductions in anxiety and depression, but there were no significant between-group differences.\nIn a later study, Krupitsky et al44 investigated whether repeated ketamine dosing increased abstinence rates in heroinaddicted individuals. Fifty-nine detoxified heroin-dependent participants received 5 hours of psychotherapy to prepare for the ketamine experience prior to receiving the first intramuscular ketamine injection (2mg/kg). The ketamine session was 1.5\u20132hours in length and psychotherapy was provided concurrently. An additional 5 hours of psychotherapy was provided to patients following the ketamine-psychotherapy session to help integrate the experience. Six of the 59 participants dropped out during the initial ketamine sessions, and the remaining 53 were randomized into single dose (n=27) or multi-dose (n=26) groups. All patients were then discharged. Those in the multi-dose group returned for additional ketamine-psychotherapy sessions at 1 and 2 months. Addiction counselling was provided prior to the ketamine-psychotherapy sessions. Those in the single-dose group did not receive additional ketamine sessions, instead returning at 1 and 2 months for addiction counselling. Within the multi-dose group, 4 of 26 (15.4%) participants relapsed and dropped out of the study following the second KAP treatment, as compared to 7 of the 27 (25.9%) participants in the single-dose group who relapsed and dropped out after the first counseling session. The difference in treatment retention between the two groups was not significant. The 1-year follow-up, however, revealed a significant difference between abstinence rates, with 50% (13 of 26) of the multi-dose participants retaining abstinent, as compared to the 22.2% (6 of 27) of participants who only received a single dose. Reductions in depression and anxiety, as measured by the Zung SelfRated Depression scale (ZDS) and the Spielberger Self-Rated State-Trait Anxiety Scale (SAS) were found amongst those who remained abstinent, but no significant differences were observed between groups."

            "text": "This systematic narrative review suggest that KAP may be effective in initiating rapid, significant benefits for a wide range of disorders. However, variability in study design, intervention structure, patient diagnoses, and outcome measurement, along with small sample sizes, limit firm conclusions. Nonetheless, some commonalities in the reviewed studies are identifiable and worthy of mention.\nKAP\u2019s capacity to facilitate rapid clinically significant reductions of anxiety and depression has been observed in multiple studies.23,28,34\u201336,40,41,43,44 Reported increases in treatment engagement28 have also been observed and attributed to such sudden gains, as rapid reductions in depression/anxiety have been associated with lower drop-out rates and increased participation in therapy.47\nIn the treatment of substance dependence, the integration of ketamine and psychotherapy appears to promote abstinence initiation, improve relapse prevention, improve craving reactivity management, and increase motivations to terminate drug-use in select individuals.42,43,45,46\nKetamine is currently being used in pain management;3,8,9 and additional psychotherapy appears to improve the duration of benefits in select patients.22\nThe psychoactive properties of higher ketamine doses have been hypothesized to facilitate psychotherapy, via linked \u201cpsychedelic\u201d experiences that increase rapport, reduce defensiveness, and evoke transpersonal experiences that aid decision-making and support transformation, as observed in studies on depression, PTSD, and addiction.23,28,40,43 Ketamine has also been proposed to facilitate the neuroplasticity involved in new memory formation, fear extinction, and the restructuring of traumatic memories.14\nSubstantial variations in KAP administration were observed in the included studies, particularly in respect to the psychotherapeutic modalities applied to diverse clinical populations and settings. While the present results do not provide indications favoring any single KAP administration protocol, some common themes appear, including: (1) preparation of patients for KAP sessions as an important first step, as realistic goal setting and positive expectations promote therapeutic alliance and structure transformational experiences.23,28,40 (2) Supervision by qualified personnel during the administration of ketamine is recommended to: a) ensure patient safety, b) guide transformational experiences, c) provide comfort and assistance in navigating distress, and d) evoke psychological insight.23,28,40 (3) It has been proposed that ketamine administration should be followed by additional psychotherapy to facilitate the integration of ketamine-induced transpersonal experiences and promote patient acceptance of insights discovered during KAP.23,28,43,44 Longer-term psychotherapy may be helpful in sustaining these gains.23,36,40\nJournal of Pain Research 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S360733 DovePress 1701\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nWhile a single dose of ketamine can reduce distressing symptoms, some evidence supports the administration of multiple doses over multiple sessions. In a study of individuals with cannabis use disorder,46 additional infusions of ketamine (and higher doses), administered to non-responders and those experiencing difficulties in maintaining abstinence, were well tolerated and helped promote abstinence. Moreover, research into the efficacy of KAP in participants with heroin addiction indicated that those in the multi-dose group maintained greater abstinence rates than those in the single-dose group.44 While there were no reported differences in reductions of depression and anxiety scores between the single and multi-dose groups in the above studies, multiple administrations of ketamine seemed to prolong therapeutic effects and resulted in initial non-responders experiencing apparent ketamine-related benefits.34,46 As ketamine nonresponders are identifiable,23,34,35,46 the frequency of ketamine administration during KAP treatments can be further investigated to maximize overall responsiveness.\nThe antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of KAP have been reported in ketamine-responders across most studies regardless of dose or administration route. However, higher doses of ketamine in conjunction with psychotherapy may promote the durability of these gains as demonstrated by higher heroin abstinence rates in high-dose ketamine groups when compared to low-dose groups.43 Nonetheless, these findings are limited to a single RCT that compared the efficacy of high-dose vs low-dose ketamine. Future research should further examine whether higher doses of ketamine in KAP session may prolong beneficial effects within larger sample sizes.\nOverall, it appears that higher-doses of ketamine, more frequent KAP sessions, and longer durations of psychotherapy increase the efficacy and durability of improvements within patients with a range of disorders.23,43,44,46 Based on the results of the present review and considering the heterogeneity of populations studied, it is not possible to recommend one psychotherapeutic modality over another or an ideal number of sessions, although it seems appropriate to tailor approaches to individuals and their presenting problems. Further work is required to make progress in this area.\nKAP is now being used in private clinics for a variety of disorders.23 However, more work is needed to identify a consistent and effective protocol for KAP administration. While KAP has been reported to be effective in alleviating distressing symptomatology, many participants experience relapse and/or the reemergence of mental health and painrelated symptoms.22,34,36,42\u201346 This is compounded by the significant time and financial costs to patients involved in the uptake of KAP.15,48,49 Future research should build on our current understandings of the benefits of treatment and aim to improve efficacy and the duration of effects using larger sample sizes. These findings would serve to establish the feasibility of KAP interventions and could inform maintenance programs.\nAs mentioned above, some individuals appear not to respond to ketamine administration and have been called \u201cnonresponders\u201d.23,28,34,35,46 It may be possible that those who do not achieve an immediate response to standard doses of ketamine may require either additional ketamine sessions, or perhaps require a higher dose, titrated to effect.34,44,46 More investigation is necessary to understand whether individuals are genuinely \u201cnon-responders\u201d to ketamine, or if the dosage of ketamine can be tailored to the individual to elicit a response. While most participants tolerated KAP well, some were unable to complete ketamine administration and dropped out of treatment.23,37,41,44,45 Therefore, drop out in relation to administration patterns should be addressed in further investigations with the aims of increasing tolerability and response rates.\nAlthough ketamine has been observed to be beneficial in reducing pain intensity in patients with chronic pain, the studies in which participants with chronic pain were recruited focused on other comorbid factors.21,22 The interaction between pain, mental health and addictive disorders, has been established in previous studies; indicating high levels of comorbidity, mutual exacerbation of symptoms, shared responses to similar treatments, and implicating similar biological pathways and neurotransmitters.50\u201353 Chronic pain patients are 2\u20133 times more likely to experience an anxiety disorder;53\u201355 with 20\u201350% of chronic pain patients reporting comorbid depression,56\u201358 and 36\u201356% experiencing a substance use disorder within their lifetime.59 Likewise, individuals with pain conditions are more likely to develop mental health and/or addictive disorders, and those with depression are more likely to develop addictive and/or pain conditions.52,55,59\u201361 Emotional distress has been demonstrated to increase pain intensity, fosters greater pain-related disability, and contributes to weaker responses to traditional pain treatments.53,54,62 For pain, treatment is usually based on the mechanisms involved (ie, neuropathic, nociceptive or a combination of both) and often includes the prescription of opioids.63 Long-term use of opioids has been associated increased tolerance and hyperalgesia, continued experiences of\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S360733 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2022:151702\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\npain, gastrointestinal and CNS side effects, and opioid dependence/addiction.64,65 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antidepressants are also provided to treat pain symptoms, however NSAIDs have been found to be responsible for 30% of hospital admissions for adverse drug reactions,66 and the efficacy of antidepressants on pain management are inconclusive.67 Psychotherapy may be effective in the management of pain,68\u201370 however despite these findings, some patients do not benefit from this treatment alone.71 Traditional approaches to the treatment of mental health and addiction also includes the use of psychotropic medications and psychotherapy.72,73 Psychotropic medications elicit partial responses in 50\u201370% of depressed patients, with only 30% achieving remission of depressive symptoms; while psychotherapy alone has been found even less effective.74\u201376 Psychotropic medications show some depressive symptom relief for patients with comorbid mental health and substance abuse disorders, however they appear to have little effect on patients with substance abuse disorders without comorbid mental health issues.72 Likewise, relapse rates following common psychotherapeutic interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy have been estimated to be as high as 60%.77,78 The interaction between the experience of pain, mental health, and substance abuse is complex; however, research demonstrates better outcomes when all comorbid conditions are treated concurrently with pharmacology and psychotherapy rather than with medication or psychotherapy alone.79,80 Currently, there are no studies focusing on the effects of KAP on chronic pain without comorbid substance dependence or mental health disorders. KAP\u2019s propensity to help with the management of pain should be specifically investigated in future studies and reviews. Both ketamine alone and psychotherapy alone have been shown to reduce pain in those with chronic pain conditions,2,7,81,82 however a gap in research exists regarding the efficacy of KAP for the management of chronic pain. The findings from the present review should be interpreted in the light of the several methodological limitations. This review included studies with small sample sizes. There are five case studies,21,22,28,36,40 two pilot trials38,42 and two proof-of-concept trials.41,46 Due to the small number of participants in each study, their findings may not be generalizable to wider populations.\nIn addition, because of the relatively small number of published literature and our wish to be as inclusive as possible, the present review included conferences abstracts36,39 which lack important details, including adequate information on the long-term duration of KAP treatment, modalities of psychotherapy employed, significance of results, or populations studied (ie, patient demographics and/or group of allocation.)\nOnly 7 of the 17 studies included in this review were RCTs. Case series/case studies comprised 29.4% (n=5) of the studies highlighted in this review. While offering detailed descriptions of KAP interventions, these studies lack a concurrent control group, which makes drawing any conclusions relating to the efficacy of KAP difficult. Observed effects within these studies have little statistical validity, and may be influenced by outside factors, such as other concurrent treatments. Additionally, these studies lack blinding and randomization, which also makes assessing the efficacy of KAP a challenge, and introduces the possibility of selection bias.\nFinally, the heterogeneity of the populations studied and the methods employed make generalizing findings difficult."

Ketamine\u2019s demonstrated ability to produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects likely interacts with the processes involved in psychotherapy, ideally as a conduit for rapid-change, increasing treatment engagement and adherence, building the therapeutic alliance, and lowering defensiveness by providing reprieves from distressing symptomology while inducing transpersonal experiences at higher doses. Continued engagement in psychotherapy after ketamine administration may prolong the often-transient effects of ketamine and allow for the integration of psychological insights into everyday functioning. While at present there is no standard approach to the application of KAP, it is important to prepare and support the patient during ketamine administration and to offer follow-up psychotherapy sessions to maintain positive effects and delay or eliminate relapse. As KAP research continues to evolve, a focus on increasing the duration of positive effects may lead to effective interventions and maintenance programs, improving KAP such that it becomes an effective, long-lasting treatment for complex, resistant, and chronic conditions for people living with pain, mental health, and substance use disorders.\nJournal of Pain Research 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S360733 DovePress 1703\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"
