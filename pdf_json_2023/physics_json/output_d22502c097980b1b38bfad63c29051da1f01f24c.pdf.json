The Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a critical role in regulating BAs homeostasis, making it an essential target for cholestasis treatment. Although several active FXR agonists have been identified, effective drugs for cholestasis are still lacking. To address this, a molecular docking-based virtual screening method was used to identify potential FXR agonists. A hierarchical screening strategy was employed to improve the screening accuracy, and six compounds were selected for further evaluation. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to demonstrate FXR activation by the screened compounds, and their cytotoxicity was then evaluated. Among the compounds, licraside showed the best performance and was selected for in vivo evaluation using an ANIT-induced cholestasis animal model. Results demonstrated that licraside significantly reduced biliary TBA, serum ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, TBIL, and TBA levels. Liver histopathological analysis showed that licraside also had a therapeutic effect on ANIT-induced liver injury. Overall, these findings suggest that licraside is an FXR agonist with potential therapeutic effects on cholestasis. This study provides valuable insights into the development of novel lead compounds from traditional Chinese medicine for cholestasis treatment.\nKEYWORDS\nFXR, licraside, agonist, cholestasis, virtual screening, biological evaluation\n1 Introduction\nCholestasis is a pathological condition that disrupts bile formation, excretion, and enterohepatic circulation, leading to the retention of toxic bile constituents, including bile salts (Ghonem et al., 2015). Bile acids (BAs) are endogenous substances that play critical physiological roles, including absorption and transport of fat and fat-soluble vitamins, elimination of cholesterol, and regulation of gut microbiome. More importantly, BAs serve as signaling molecules that activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), regulating their own synthesis, transport, and glucose and lipid homeostasis. Disruption of this balance can cause cholestasis, which if untreated, can progress to hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver tumors (Maillette de Buy Wenniger et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2016; Cruz-Ram\u00f3n et al., 2017). Therefore, regulation of BAs pathways has become a novel strategy to treat cholestasis. FXR"

Activation of FXR by agonists can directly activate the transcription of genes encoding small heterodimer partner (SHP) in the liver, which represses the expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 to reduce the synthesis of BAs (Kong et al., 2012), then down-regulates the expression of Na+-dependent taurocholic acid cotransporter (NTCP) to reduce hepatic uptake of BAs, and increases the expression of multidrug resistance associated protein 2/3 (MRP2/3) and bile salt export pump (BSEP) to promote the secretion of BAs from liver to bile. Moreover, FXR can induce phase I and II reactions to increase the hydrophilicity of BAs, making it easier to be excreted through urine. Studies in animalmodels have found that targeted deletion of Fxr results in increased levels of serum bile acids, while mice with FXR gene knockout show BAs accumulation and liver injury (Sinal et al., 2000; Kong et al., 2019). Genetic variants in human FXR are associated with a spectrum of cholestatic disorders (Van Mil et al., 2007; Gomez-Ospina et al., 2016). In conclusion, FXR plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cholestasis, and specific activation of FXR represents a promising way to treat cholestasis.\nFXR has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for cholestatic liver disorders (Stofan et al., 2020), and its agonists have gained approval for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). However, the use of the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) has resulted in several side effects, including pruritus and an increased risk of hepatic decompensation in cirrhotic PBCpatients (Nevens et al., 2016).Despite this, a large number of clinical and preclinical studies are still seeking novel and effective FXR agonists for the treatment of cholestasis and related diseases. Natural products are a promising source for bioactive agents and lead compounds for drug discovery (Hiebl et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020). Recently, Picroside II andYangoninwere reported to exert protective effects against cholestasis through FXR activation (Gao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020), and 72 natural compounds were identified as FXR agonists (She et al., 2021). However, many lead compounds have failed in preclinical and clinical developments due to toxicological and/or pharmacokinetic issues, and further discovery of FXR agonists from natural resources remains of great value. FXR has typical structural features of the NR family and binds to the retinoid X receptor (RXR) in the form of heterodimers to regulate transcription of downstream genes (Sever et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018). The ligand binding domain (LBD) of FXR is composed of 12 a-helices and induces a conformational change in the activation domain (AF2) (Jin et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2015) upon binding appropriate ligands, leading to the release of co-repressors and activation of coactivators to regulate target gene transcription.\nThis study utilized a hierarchical screening strategy that combined in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods to identify natural FXR agonists. Molecular docking, using the Glide program (Sastry et al., 2013), was employed to screen for potential FXR/RXR heterodimer targeting compounds from natural products and monomer compounds of traditional Chinese medicine. Six compounds were selected for toxicity and activation activity testing through MTT assay and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay in vitro. One hit compound, licraside, was chosen for further validation through animal experiments, which included biochemical and liver histological analysis to assess its potential therapeutic effect on cholestasis. Overall, this strategy\nprovided a rapid and effective approach to discovering novel FXR agonists from natural sources."

Only compounds one and four showed significant hepatotoxicity after 72 h exposure, with the survival rate of HepG2 cells decreasing compared to the control group (p < 0.05), and the decrease of cell viability was positively correlated with the concentration. We observed that compound 2 with 20, 40, and 80 \u03bcM interventions for 72 h could all result in a slight decrease in cell viability. Non-etheless, this decrease was not significantly different from the effects observed after 24 h of treatment. When reaching 100 \u00b5M after 72 h intervention, compound 2 could cause significant hepatic cell death. These findings indicated that prolonged and high-dose interventions may lead to hepatotoxicity. Therefore, a 24 h intervention time was used for subsequent experiments.\nThe activation activity of the six compounds on FXR was evaluated using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The results indicated that the candidate compounds exhibited weaker activation activity compared to the positive control group (Figure 4A). However, among the compounds tested, compound 2 demonstrated the highest activity and was selected for further concentration-dependent experiments. In Figure 4B, it is illustrated that compound 2 had already effectively activated FXR at the cellular level at the concentration of 20 \u03bcM, and the luciferase activity of the reporter gene was significantly increased compared to the vehicle group (p < 0.01), albeit not as potent as the endogenous agonist CDCA. Moreover, compound 2 exhibited a dose-dependent activation activity of FXR. When the concentration increased to 100 \u03bcM, the activation activity of compound 2 became even stronger. The above results indicated the potency of compound 2 in activating FXR. To further assess its safety, a 24-h MTT assay was conducted, expanding the concentration range of compound 2 up to 800 \u00b5M. Supplementary Figure S1 presents the results,\nindicating that compound 2 did not adversely affect cell viability within the tested concentration range. Even at the highest tested concentration of 800 \u03bcM, no decrease in cell viability was observed.

            "text": "To investigate the impact of licraside intervention on the expression of FXR and its downstream signaling proteins in HepG2 cells, Western blot experiment was conducted. The results are presented in Figure 4C. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the level of SHP following licraside intervention compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, when the intervention concentration of licraside was 80 \u03bcM, there was a significant upregulation of BSEP expression (p < 0.01). Although BSEP expression also increased in other intervention groups, the differences were not statistically significant. These findings suggested that licraside has the ability to activate FXR and subsequently induce the upregulation of downstream proteins SHP and BSEP in vitro."

During the initial 4 days, minimal fluctuations in body weight were observed across all groups. However, starting from the fifth day, significant weight loss was observed in the ANIT group, the OCA group (positive drug control), and the three licraside groups, compared to the control group. Notably, the OCA group exhibited the most substantial weight loss, consistent with the findings from a phase III clinical trial where OCA treatment in patients led to a dose-dependent decrease in body weight after 18 months (Younossi et al., 2019). These results suggested that the observed weight loss may be attributed to the involvement of FXR in regulating lipid metabolic homeostasis, with alterations in lipid balance contributing to the decrease in body weight.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08\nIn the licraside groups, mice in the low- and medium-dose groups experienced slightly less weight loss compared to the ANIT group. Moreover, there was a significant increase in body weight in these groups compared to the OCA group (p < 0.05). Importantly, throughout the course of the animal experiments, the mice maintained overall good health. Subsequent pathological analysis revealed significant alleviation of cholestasis symptoms following licraside treatment. Therefore, we concluded that the observed weight loss in mice did not significantly impact the efficacy assessment of licraside in this study."

As shown in Figure 6, compared to the control group, the model group exhibited significantly increased levels of these six biochemical markers in serum (p < 0.001), confirming the successful establishment of the intrahepatic cholestasis animal model. Treatment with OCA and licraside at high and medium doses significantly reduced the levels of serum ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, TBIL, and TBA compared to the model group (p < 0.001). Consistent with the above conclusions, licraside intervention effectively reversed the elevation of serum biomarkers in the ANIT-induced cholestasis model, with a significant decrease in TBA levels, suggesting the potential efficacy of licraside in relieving cholestasis."

Compared to the control group, ANIT-induced cholestasis model mice exhibited pathological changes such as hepatocyte swelling, diffuse vacuolization, inflammatory cell infiltration, and hepatocyte necrosis, indicating evident hepatocyte damage. After OCA administration, hepatocyte size was consistent, and there was apparent sinusoidal space between them. Low-dose licraside intervention reduced fat vacuole formation\nand eliminated inflammatory cell infiltration in the bile duct area, with slightly enlarged hepatocytes. Medium-dose licraside intervention showed clear nuclei of liver cells and little hepatocyte necrosis, without fat vacuole formation. High-dose licraside treatment resulted in mice hepatocytes being uniform in size, morphology, and structure, arranged radially and neatly, similar to the control group. These histopathological results indicate that licraside has a significant therapeutic effect on liver injury in ANIT-induced cholestasis mice, and may be useful in alleviating cholestasis."

            "text": "Symptoms of chronic cholestasis can persist for at least 6 months. While there may be no obvious symptoms in the early stages, hyperbilirubinemia may occur as the disease progresses. If left untreated, bile duct necrosis, inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure may occur. BAs disorder promotes the development of cholestasis and is an important pathogenesis. FXR is the main regulator that maintains the homeostasis of BAs, and decreased FXR expression causes abnormal bile acid metabolism (Shearn et al., 2019). Therefore, FXR plays an important role in protecting liver function from the toxic damage of BAs. FXR activation can maintain lipid balance and reduce hepatic steatosis, making it an important therapeutic target in cholestasis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is approved for the treatment of cholestasis, but about 40% of patients with PBC have no respond to UDCA (Santiago et al., 2020). OCA is then approved to treat PBC patients unresponsive to UDCA (Fiorucci et al., 2011; Ali et al., 2016). However, as mentioned earlier, OCA has some side effects. Therefore, the discovery of novel agonists targeting FXR is still of great research value.\nIn this study, we presented an \u201cin silico \u2192 in vitro \u2192 in vivo\u201d screening strategy to discover potential novel FXR agonists for the treatment of cholestasis. We used the binding mode of cocrystallized ligand WAY-362450 and FXR for the in silico screening process. The binding mode analysis can recognize the important interaction and residues that are responsible for binding affinity. Compound 2 (licraside), which showed better results in subsequent cell experiments, was selected as an example to analyze the binding interaction. The XP Gscore value was \u221216.192 kJ/mol. The FXR-#2 complex\u2019s conformation (Figure 1B) showed that residues TYR383, SER346, ARG278, and ASN307 were the key players. The phenolic hydroxyl group of licraside acted as both H-bond acceptor and donor, forming two H-bonds with ARG278 and ASN307, and the two hydroxyl groups of the furan ring formed an H-bond with TYR383 and SER346, respectively. The benzene formed a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction with HIS308. Besides, hydrophobic interaction is also critical. These interactions are similar to that observed in the crystal structure of FXR agonist.\nVirtual screening often suffers from a high false positive rate, as discussed by Bender et al. (2021). To mitigate this issue, several strategies have been developed to ensure the reliability of virtual screening, including evaluating docking and screening abilities, analyzing structural diversity, and inspecting binding modes. However, it is important to note that many compounds that appear effective in theory may be inactive in vitro and/or in vivo,\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09\nemphasizing the need to sequentially evaluate toxicity and efficacy at both the cellular and animal levels.\nTo this end, Licraside, an isoglycyrrhizin-4\u2032-O-carinose (1\u21922) glucoside flavonoid compound derived from licorice, was identified as a potential agonist of FXR that could effectively inhibit TBA and TBIL levels while decreasing ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT levels in vivo, thereby demonstrating significant cholagogic effects. Licorice is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat various ailments, such as gastric, liver, respiratory, and metabolic disorders, and its active extracts possess various medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antimicrobial, antivirus, cell-protective, and chemo-preventive effects.\nIt is imperative to emphasize that safety considerations hold paramount importance throughout the drug development process. It is duly recognized that the current study has limitations concerning the exploration of toxicity. Therefore, future investigations should incorporate systematic and comprehensive research methods to evaluate the safety profile of licraside thoroughly. Undertaking such measures is essential and imperative to provide robust evidence for further assessment of licraside\u2019s potential as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent.\nOverall, through in silico screening, we discovered six hit compounds with clear activation activities targeting FXR, and licraside demonstrated good safety and is a promising lead compound for alleviating cholestasis. This study affirms the feasibility of computer-assisted drug discovery and provides new insights into developing novel agonists for treating cholestasis by targeting FXR."
