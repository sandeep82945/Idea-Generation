Data were analyzed from August 2021 to December 2021. Self-reported depressive symptoms were determined using a 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD-10) with a total score range of 0\u201330. Item responses of 3\u20134 or 5\u20137 days were deemed indicative of specific depressive symptoms. The outcome variables were self-reported accidental falls and injurious falls.\nResults: Of the 12,392 participants included in the study, 3,671 (29.6%) had high baseline depressive symptoms (CESD-10 scores \u2265 10), 1,892 (15.3%) experienced falls, and 805 (6.5%) experienced injurious falls during 2015\u20132018 follow-up. High depressive symptoms increased the risk of falls [odds ratio (OR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19\u20131.50] and injurious falls (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.51) in a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for major demographic, health-related, and anthropometric covariates. All of the 10 specific depressive symptoms except \u201cfelt hopeless\u201d were associated with falls, and four specific symptoms significantly increased the risk of injurious falls; \u201chad trouble concentrating\u201d (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.13\u20131.55); \u201cfelt depressed\u201d (OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.12\u20131.55); \u201ceverythingwas an e ort\u201d (OR 1.23, 95%CI 1.04\u20131.45); and \u201crestless sleep\u201d (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.40).\nConclusion: High depressive symptoms are significantly related to risk of falls and injurious falls. Four specific symptoms (had trouble concentrating, felt depressed, everything was an e ort, and restless sleep) increase the risk of injurious falls in Chinese adults aged \u2265 45 years.\nKEYWORDS\ndepressive symptoms, fall, injurious fall, cohort study (or longitudinal study), CHARLS\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "As populations age, falls are becoming an increasing global health concern (1). Injuries resulting from severe falls such as fractures and traumatic brain injuries requiremedical treatment. These injuries can lead to chronic pain, disability, and even death (2, 3). Worldwide 37.3 million patients who suffer from falls require medical treatment each year, and falls cause the loss of >17 million disability-adjusted life-years (1). In 2019 the morbidity of falls in mainland China in adults aged >60 years was 3,799.4 per 100,000. The incidence rate of deaths associated with falls was 39.2 per 100,000, and that of disability-adjusted life-years associated with falls was 1,238.9 per 100,000 (4). Detecting, modifying, and preventing risk factors for falls in adults may reduce the number of falls, injurious falls, and associated complications.\nDepressive symptoms are a mental problem characterized by sadness, loss of interest in activities, and reduced energy (5). They are typically measured by validated rating scales with established cutoffs such as the Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (6). Depressive symptoms are consistently associated with falls (7\u201311). Two studies conducted in the United States and Canada demonstrated significant associations between baseline depressive symptoms and subsequent falls in community-dwelling older populations (7, 9). Systematic reviews (10, 11) also indicate a relationship between high depressive symptoms and an increased risk of falls in older adults. Notably, previous studies (7\u201311) have considered depressive symptoms as a dichotomous factor (e.g., present or not), or have used a total depression score. Such studies assumed that depressive symptoms are a single condition, and that all specific symptoms are fungible and equally valid indicators. Specific depressive symptoms such as sadness, sleep disorders, inattention, and suicidal ideation are distinct conditions, and they differ in significant respects such as potential biology, effect on injury, and risk factors (12). Moreover, most prior studies have concentrated on the role of depressive symptoms only on the occurrence of falls, while ignoring resulting injuries that required medical care (8\u201311), or they have only examined these relationships in older people (9\u201311).\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate associations between depressive symptoms\u2014including elevated high depressive symptoms and specific depressive symptoms\u2014and falls and injurious falls in Chinese populations aged 45 years and over."

Compared with those with low depressive symptoms (CESD-10 score < 10), participants with high depressive symptoms were less likely to be male, younger, urban residents, and married. They were more likely to have no formal education, be nonsmokers and nondrinkers, and have body pains. Participants with high depressive symptoms also had a greater percentage of self-reported physician-diagnosed medical conditions and medication use, lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lower body mass index, smaller waist circumference, weaker handgrip strength, lower peak expiratory flow, and lower levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, Creactive protein, glucose, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and uric acid (Table 1). Baseline differences between included and excluded individuals are shown in Supplementary Table 1.\nAssociations between depressive symptoms and falls and injurious falls\nDuring the follow-up period from August 2015 to August 2018, a total of 1,892 participants experienced falls, and 805 of those had injurious falls. The incidence rates of falls and injurious falls were higher in individuals with high depressive symptoms. High depressive symptoms independently predicted the occurrence of falls (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.50) and injurious falls (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.51) after adjustments for all covariates.

            "text": "In the current study depressive symptoms were positively associated with falls and injurious falls during a 3-year followup period in middle-aged and older adults. Specifically, high depressive symptoms at baseline increased the risks of falls and injurious falls. Most specific depressive symptoms were independently associated with falls, and four specific symptoms (\u201chad trouble concentrating\u201d, \u201cfelt depressed\u201d, \u201ceverything was an effort\u201d, and \u201crestless sleep\u201d) were significantly associated with injurious falls.\nThe population selected for the study was individuals without a history of falls within the previous 2 years, based on the possibility that falls themselves may lead to depressive symptoms (17, 18). The results of the present study corroborate prior studies with regard to positive associations between high depressive symptoms and falls and injurious falls. Patients with depressive symptoms had a nearly three times greater risk of falling than those without depressive symptoms (19). In another longitudinal survey high depressive symptoms estimated by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 8-item short-form were associated with an increased risk of falls 2 years later (20). Systematic reviews (10, 11) also indicate relationships between high depressive symptoms and increased risks of falls in elderly adults. In the current study high depressive symptoms were a significant predictor of injurious falls, which is consistent with a prior study (7). Compared with these previous studies, this study not only had much larger sample size over a wider age range (\u226545 years old at baseline) and a longer follow-up time,\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 04 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of falls and injurious falls according to depressive symptoms scores. Graphs show ORs for falls (A) and injurious falls (B) adjusted for age, gender, residence, marital status, educational level, smoking status, drinking status, body pains, history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, heart diseases, kidney diseases, neuropsychiatric diseases and arthritis or rheumatism; and use hypertension medications, diabetes medications, heart medications, neuropsychiatric medications; and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, body mass index, waist circumference, handgrip strength and peak expiratory flow. Data were fitted by a restricted cubic spline generalized linear regression model. The depressive symptoms score ranges from 0 to 30, with the highest score representing the highest risk of depressive symptoms. Solid lines indicate ORs, and shaded part indicate 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nbut also paid attention to the influence of specific depressive symptoms on falls and injurious falls.\nThe effects of specific depressive symptoms on falls and injurious falls have not been fully investigated. In a cross-sectional investigation attention interference and loss of executive control were associated with falls in elderly adults (21). Poor attention during gait increased the risk of falls in elderly people (22). Australian assisted-living-care residents with <6 h sleep had a higher likelihood of experiencing multiple falls after 1 year (23). Poor sleep quality, insomnia, and increased sleep disturbances were associated with increased likelihood of recurrent falls (24). A fear of falling that reduces activity and further decreases gait quantity and quality increases the likelihood of falling (25). In a longitudinal study perceived social isolation was reportedly related to a 33% increase in fall risk (26). The present study is the first to investigate the influences of specific depressive symptoms as determined via a depression rating scale on falls and injurious falls.\nThere are several possibilities with respect to mechanisms underlying associations between depressive symptoms and falls and injurious falls. Numerous risk factors for falls such as psychomotor retardation and gait alteration are common in older people with depressive symptoms in epidemiological investigations (27, 28). Individuals with depressive symptoms also tend to exhibit cognitive deficits that affect attention, executive functions, and processing speed, which can all increase the risk of falls and injurious falls (29). By influencing levels of\ninflammatory cytokines, vitamin D levels, and some hormone concentrations, depressive symptoms may lead to factures (29, 30). Lastly, multiple somatic comorbidities related to falls are often associated with depression (31). Women are more likely to experience depressive symptoms than men (32), which may be the reason why depressive symptoms is more strongly associated with injurious falls in women. Prior studies supported that people with diabetes were at a significantly higher risk of falls and injurious falls than people without diabetes across (33, 34). This study found stronger associations of depressive symptoms with injurious falls among non-diabetes participants and possible reason was selection bias.\nThe strengths of the current study include the evaluation of specific depressive symptoms, its prospective design, inclusion of the outcomes of injurious falls, the long follow-up period, and adjustments for various confounding factors. The study also had some limitations. First, data pertaining to falls and chronic comorbidities were self- reported, which may have resulted in bias. Second, the CESD-10 was used to evaluate depressive symptoms rather than clinical diagnosis. However, our findings do highlight the importance of assessing depressive symptoms to avoid falls and injurious falls in adults aged \u226545 years. Additional specific depressive symptoms associated with falls and injurious falls may be discovered via the use of other validated rating scales. Third, the findings may not fully apply to other countries because the study was conducted in Chinese adults aged 45 years and over. Fourth, the study\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 07 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 Association between depressive symptoms (high vs. low) and falls and injurious falls risk stratified by di erent factors.

Despite adjustments for many confounding factors, residual confounding factors may still exist. Fifth, the falls or injuries cases within the first follow-up year should be excluded in the sensitivity analysis to exclude an inverse causal relationship. It was difficult to conduct limited by the availability of data."
