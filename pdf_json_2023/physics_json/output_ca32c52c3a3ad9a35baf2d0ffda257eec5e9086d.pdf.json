    "abstractText": "Protein kinases are key regulators of cell signaling and have been important therapeutic targets for three decades. ATP-competitive drugs directly inhibit the activity of kinases but these enzymes work as part of complex protein networks in which protein\u2013protein interactions (often referred to as kinase docking) may govern a more complex activation pattern. Kinase docking is indispensable for many signaling disease-relevant Ser/Thr kinases and it is mediated by a dedicated surface groove on the kinase domain which is distinct from the substrate-binding pocket. Thus, interfering with kinase docking provides an alternative strategy to control kinases. We describe activity sensors developed for p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs: ERK, p38, and JNK) whose substrate phosphorylation is known to depend on kinasedocking-groove-mediated protein\u2013protein binding. The in vitro assays were based on fragment complementation of the NanoBit luciferase, which is facilitated upon substrate motif phosphorylation. The new phosphorylation-assisted luciferase complementation (PhALC) sensors are highly selective and the PhALC assay is a useful tool for the quantitative analysis of kinase activity or kinase docking, and even for high-throughput screening of academic compound collections.",

            "text": "Protein kinases control cellular functions via the phosphorylation of downstream substrate proteins and direct mutations in the kinase affecting its enzymatic properties. More indirect systems-level changes in kinase-based signaling networks are known to cause various human diseases [1]. Fortunately, illicit kinase activation could be artificially modulated via ATP-competitive drugs [2]. Mechanistically, this pharmaceutical strategy targets the \u201cdruggable\u201d deep nucleotide-binding pocket common to all members of the human kinome (~520 kinases) and there are dozens of specific kinase inhibitors currently used to combat signaling diseases such as cancer or inflammation [3,4]. Unfortunately, acquired resistance to these classical kinase inhibitors, due to somatic mutations or systemslevel changes, may render these drugs inefficient in cancer patients [5,6]. This necessitates the development of new inhibitors that mechanistically work differently [2,7,8]. Protein kinases themselves are also regulated by reversible phosphorylation and this relies on protein\u2013protein binding between kinases and their regulators (e.g., upstream kinases, phosphatases, or scaffolds), moreover, efficient phosphorylation of some of the downstream substrates requires additional protein\u2013protein contacts which are distinct from those mediated by the universal substrate-binding pocket located next to the catalytic\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14854. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241914854 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14854 2 of 17\nsite/nucleotide-binding pocket. Apart from the enzymatic properties and the capacity to form the catalytic Michaelis\u2013Menten complex, the cellular function and the specific roles of protein kinases are thus also governed by their protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs). This mechanism is generally referred to as kinase docking and it is common among Ser/Thr kinases [9]. Docking increases the specificity of target site phosphorylation: it involves a dedicated PPI surface on the kinase domain (namely the docking groove) and a linear binding motif sequence from the partner (namely the docking motif) [10]. The docking motif is normally located in a disordered region and contains a set of amino acids fitting into the docking groove upon binding. Docking motifs facilitate the phosphorylation of functionally important phosphorylation target sites by enhanced proximity [11,12]. The binding affinity between the kinase-docking groove and the docking motif is in the low to medium micromolar range [13,14]. In summary, kinase-docking grooves expedite more selective phosphorylation of substrates, while they are also engaged in binding to upstream kinases and/or to phosphatases [15]. Docking interactions have long been known for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and have been discovered more recently for the cAMP-dependent, cGMPdependent, and protein kinase C (AGC) kinase domain of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) [16\u201318]. From a biological standpoint these PPIs help to explain how a certain MAPK or an AGC kinase domain can selectively phosphorylate specific target sites in substrates, since all MAPKs phosphorylate simple S/T-P sites (where P is a proline and serine or threonine will accept the phosphate) and most AGC kinase domains act on similar basophilic R-x-x-S/T target motifs (where R is arginine, x can be any amino acid, and serine or threonine will accept the phosphate) [19]. In summary, interference with kinase docking provides an alternative, possibly more specific, and fundamentally different strategy to ATP-competitive drugs to block kinase function for a specific set of Ser/Thr kinases. There are notable differences between ATP-competitive drugs and docking-interference-based strategies. For example, developing specific protein kinase inhibitors targeting the ATPbinding site may be very challenging because the physiological cellular ATP concentration is very high (mM), requiring nanomolar binding affinity for high potency. Moreover, the catalytic sites of many kinases exhibit remarkable similarity which is a significant challenge in avoiding off-target binding. In contrast to this, the binding partners of kinases are present only in micromolar concentration in the cell and their binding affinities to kinases are also in this far weaker range. Thus, blocking docking-based PPIs may be feasible with weaker binding molecules. However, protein\u2013protein binding surfaces are generally shallow compared to the deep ATP-binding pocket which could hamper the identification of good binders [20,21]. MAPKs and their substrates play pivotal roles in various human diseases and this kinase group includes the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 kinases that regulate diverse physiological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation [22\u201324]. ERK and RSK are key downstream constituents of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Structurally, RSK is composed of two kinase domains tethered by a flexible linker [25]. The N-terminal AGC-type kinase domain (NTK) catalyzes downstream substrate phosphorylation following its co-activation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and its C-terminal kinase domain (CTK; calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK) domain). ERK\u2014via its docking groove\u2014binds to RSK\u2019s C-terminal tail harboring a MAPK-binding linear D(ocking)-motif, which then turns on the phosphorylation cascade leading to RSK substrate phosphorylation [26]. Interestingly, this latter may also depend on kinase docking where the RSK NTK binds to so-called DxVF motifs, henceforth referred to as VF-motifs, found in RSK substrates [18]. Furthermore, MAPKs in addition to their first-discovered D-groove, binding to D-motifs, also contain an F-groove, unrelated to the former, binding to so-called FxFP motifs from substrates [27\u201329]. In summary, the MAPKs and RSK NTK provide an excellent system to test the feasibility of kinase dockinginterference-based strategies. Well-established ATP-competitive inhibitors exist for MAPKs\nInt.

Sci. 2023, 24, 14854 3 of 17\n(ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3, and p38\u03b1/\u03b2) as well as for RSK NTK, but PPI-blocking drugs for these enzymes are just emerging and this strategy is, by far, less-explored [30\u201333]. We posit that new biochemical tools/assays will likely facilitate the discovery of novel compounds targeting the docking grooves of these kinases. In the present study we report the development of an in vitro kinase assay based on luciferase fragment complementation and specific phospho-amino-acid-binding domains. We show that the phosphorylation-assisted luciferase complementation (PhALC) concept could be used in academic labs for the screening of compound libraries to identify small compounds that block kinase function. The PhALC assay uses self-made reagents, cutting down on screening costs, and is particularly geared towards finding compounds that interfere with kinase docking. The assay was validated against known ATP-competitive drugs and allows rapid quantitative assessment of inhibitor efficiency (IC50). More importantly, the assay was also validated with MAPK D- or F-groove and RSK NTK docking groove binding molecules and it is suitable to identify compounds with interesting docking-interference patterns based on a pilot study with a small academic compound collection."

            "text": "In natural phosphorylation-based signaling networks protein kinases, as the \u201cwriters\u201d, phosphorylate substrates at target motifs located in biologically critical protein regions [34]. Phospho-amino acids may then be bound by dedicated phospho-amino-acid-binding domains, as \u201creaders\u201d, which have naturally evolved to recognize specific phosphorylation events in the cell [35,36]. Target motif sequences therefore have not only evolved for optimal modification by the \u201cwriters\u201d but they are also compatible with the \u201creaders\u201d. This inspired the design of a new kinase assay concept in which natural recognition domains work together with selected target-motif-containing sensors to monitor the phosphorylation of the latter as substrates by selected kinases. In most in vitro kinase assays, protein phosphorylation is monitored by the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into the substrate, by mass spectrometry, or phosphorylation, and is recognized by artificial phospho-amino-acid-specific antibodies (Western blotting), or monitored indirectly through nucleotide cofactor hydrolysis (ADP-Glo kinase assay). These assays do not harness the natural biological specificity of intracellular phospho-amino-acidrecognizing domains and they require expensive reagents (e.g., phospho-specific antibodies or radioactive reagents) or instruments (e.g., scintillation counters and radioactive facilities or high-end mass spectrometers) that may not be available for most molecular biology labs. Currently, we know of dozens of different phospho-amino-acid-binding domains (e.g., Src homology domain 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain for phosphotyrosine and 14-3-3 or WW for phosphoserine/-threonine). These are known to bind to specific phospho-amino-acid-containing motifs with increased affinity, which\u2014as a heterologous interaction\u2014may be indirectly exploited to monitor protein phosphorylation via luciferase enzyme complementation. Luminescence measurements are sensitive, have great signalto-noise properties, and can be measured in a standard luminometer in microplates. The phosphorylation-assisted luciferase complementation (PhALC) assay requires two protein constructs: the SENSOR, which will be modified at specific sites by the examined kinase, and the RECOGNITION CONSTRUCT (RC), which will \u201cread\u201d the phosphorylation of the sensor by triggering the complementation of the luciferase (NanoBiT, whose two fragments, SmBiT and LgBiT, are located on the sensor or on the RC, respectively). The NanoBiT luciferase enzyme is particularly suited for PhALC, since it was originally developed as a dynamic protein\u2013protein-interaction-monitoring tool with very low spontaneous assembly between its two fragments [37]. The RC may contain any phospho-target-motif-binding domain whose binding specificity matches to the target motif preference of the investigated kinase. Since the constructs are modular, the sensor could be designed to contain a docking motif in addition to its target motif. Such chimera constructs, for which efficient phospho-\nInt. J. Mol.

Such chimera constructs, for which efficient phosphorylation of the target motif will depend on kinase docking, could be used to characterize a docking motif or kinase-docking-groove-mediated binding (Figure 1A,B).\nFirst, we applied the PhALC concept on RSK (Figure 2A). The RSK Sensor is a fusion between one of the two fragments of the split luciferase and the ~70-amino-acids-long SOS1 fragment, including the VF-motifs and target sites. SOS1 is a natural substrate of RSK phosphorylated by activated NTK at two specific RxxS/T target motifs [38]. The phosphorylated sensor can bind to the recognition domain containing chimera which is a fusion construct between the other fragment of the luciferase and the phosphopeptide-binding 14-3-3\u03b5 domain known to bind phosphorylated SOS1 [39]. VF-motif-based docking to the sensor, its phosphorylation by activated RSK, recognition-domain recruitment, and, ultimately, luciferase complementation increased the luminescence signal that was measured in a luminometer using microplates. Next, we tested if kinase docking could be quantitatively analyzed in the newly developed RSK PhALC assay (Figure 2B).

Phosphorylation of a kinase target site is read out in a \u201cchemical\u201d manner, via phosphorylation-induced chelation of a Mg2+ which changes the fluorescence properties of the artificial amino acid coupled next to the kinase\u2019s target Ser/Thr residue. The specificity of such Sox peptides could be greatly enhanced by using docking motifs for MAPKs [49\u201351]. Notably, FRET-based sensors incorporating genetically encodable fluor scent probe can also be used to monitor kinase activity, ho ever these probes often only produce a modest change in the fluorescence signal upon phosphorylation [52]. According to our knowledge, luminescence\u2014which is a more robust, easily measurable biophysical signal\u2014has not been widely used to examine kinases. In this study we\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14854 11 of 17\nreported the design and validation of different sensor and RCs that can be used to monitor the activity of kinases from two different Ser/Thr kinase groups (RSK and MAPKs) by measuring the luminescence signal of simple biochemical reactions or more complex cell lysate samples. Phosphorylation of a kinase target site is read out in a \u201cbiological\u201d manner, via using natural phospho-amino-acid-binding domains that can selectively recognize the phosphorylated form of the kinase\u2019s target Ser/Thr residue. Similar PhALC assays, namely new sensor/RC pairs, could likely be developed for other kinases. In principle, any kinase phosphorylating a target motif in the SENSOR binding to a natural phospho-aminoacid-binding domain in the RC could be monitored. Moreover, by exploiting the natural specificity of target motif sequences and/or kinase docking motifs, the PhALC signal could be made specific to certain kinases. The PhALC concept, for example, could likely be easily adopted to also monitor tyrosine kinase activity, since SH2 domains have naturally evolved to bind to specific phosphotyrosine target motifs [53]. The modular design of the SENSOR construct and the fact that these could be independently combined with different RECOGNITION constructs provide great flexibility for different applications and we foresee that PhALC assays will be useful tools to (1) monitor kinase activity to characterize inhibitors, (2) test sequence determinants important for kinase docking and specificity, and (3) test academic compound collections to identify modulators of kinase function (activity vs. protein\u2013protein interactions). The caveat for the latter is that in the PhALC assay, apart from the phosphorylation of the sensor, the luminescence signal requires additional protein\u2013protein binding events, such as the binding of RC to sensor as well as the complementation of the luciferase. Our study with an academic compound collection showed that the false-positive rate may indeed be high due to the complexity of the molecular events leading to the final signal, but more importantly, this could be mitigated by carrying out parallel assays with different kinases on the same set of small molecules. Two other commonly used screening methods for PPI detection that are also useful for kinase drug discovery are TR-FRET and AlphaScreen [54,55]. Time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) is the combination of time-resolved fluorometry (TRF) with F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Homogeneous TRF (HTRF) is a no-wash technology utilizing rare-earth lanthanides with long-emission half-lives as donor fluorophores and combines standard FRET with time-resolved fluorescence measurement. AlphaScreen is a non-radioactive amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay based on using functionalized beads. When biological interaction brings the beads close, the signal is greatly amplified because the laser excitation of the \u201cDonor\u201d bead generates singlet oxygen diffusing to the \u201cAcceptor\u201d bead triggering the emission of light. The drawback of these methods is that they require high-end microplate readers equipped with lasers and sensitive optical detection units for high-throughput screening as well as expensive reagents (antibodies, functionalized beads, etc.) that can be obtained only from commercial vendors. The PhALC assay measurements on the tested kinases and inhibitors gave IC50 values that matched those determined with other standard methods. According to our experiments, spontaneous luminescence of compounds in the PhALC reaction buffer, which could potentially interfere with the luciferase-generated signal is not a pragmatic problem, as opposed to fluorescence-based readouts where auto-fluorescence of compounds is often limiting. A pragmatic advantage of the PhALC assay over other kinase assay methods is that the key reagents could be self-produced using bacterial expression plasmids and these could be easily modified and tailored. Apart from the luciferase substrate (coelenterazine), assay components can be produced in a standard molecular biology lab, and the assay can be carried out in different microplate formats requires low amounts of active kinase due to its high sensitivity. Moreover, we showed that the assay can be used not only with purified kinases but the active enzyme could be produced in human cell lines by a natural activation scheme if recombinant active kinase production is limiting, and then the cell lysate can be directly added into the PhALC assay reaction mix.\nInt.

Measurements were performed using a BioTek Synergy 2 or Cytation 3-plate reader at 25 \u25e6C in white 96- or 384-well plates (SPL Life Sciences, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, #30196 or Greiner Microplate, Greiner Bio-One AG, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Austria, #781904). The reaction was induced by the addition of ATP (at 0.1 or 1 mM final concentration) dissolved in 1X kinase buffer. Peptide inhibitor stocks were at 10 mM concentration in buffer (50 mM Tris, pH = 8.0), while the stocks of the other inhibitors were at 10 mM in DMSO. The luminescence signal was monitored for 30\u201360 min and the slope from the initial linear region was calculated by linear regression. For IC50 determination selected inhibitors or peptides were serial diluted in the indicated range. Luminescence signal was observed for a duration of up to 30 min. During this time, we specifically looked at the initial linear phase, which usually occurred within the first 5 min. To quantify the rate of change in the signal during this early period, we used linear regression analysis to calculate the slope. The initial slopes obtained in this manner were normalized using the positive and negative controls, and then a dose-response curve was fitted to the obtained values in Origin 2018 (DoseResponse function). ATP-competitive inhibitors were purchased: SL0101 from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), #HY-15237; staurosporin from SelleckChem (Houston, TX, USA), #S1421; SCH772984 from SelleckChem, #S7101; SB202190 from SelleckChem, #S1077; JNK-IN-8 from SelleckChem, #S4901,> and SP600125 from SelleckChem, #S1460. The docking peptides added in trans into the PhALC reaction mix were chemically synthesized (pepMNK1: MKLSPPSKSRLARRRALA, pepNFAT4: LERPSRDHLYLPLE, and pepFENEF: GLFNELASPFENEFKKAS) using Fmoc/tBu chemistry. ORF45_17mer (PTVIDMSAPDDVFAEDT) was purchased from NovoPro Bioscience Inc. (Shanghai, China).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14854 14 of 17"

            "text": "The in-house academic compound library of the Research Center for Natural Sciences, Budapest, was assembled from chemist groups comprised of mostly small, fragment-like compounds (~500). 88 compounds from this were chosen based on Tanimoto index similarity analysis using KNIME to represent the full diversity of the larger compound collection in a smaller set [57,58]. The reaction mix for academic compound screening was 50 mM HEPES, pH = 7.4; 100 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 5% glycerol; and 0.05% Igepal, which included a kinase at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 nM, two luciferase constructs at 1-1 \u00b5M, and coelenterazine at a concentration of 60 \u00b5M. In the case of RSK measurements, the solution also contained 6 mg of BSA. Inhibitors were added to achieve a final concentration of 200 \u00b5M using the Mosquito pipetting robot. The reactions were initiated by adding 15 \u00b5L of an ATP-containing solution, resulting in a final ATP concentration of 100 \u00b5M in the reaction mix, and the reaction was monitored for 10 min. Subsequently, a linear fit was applied to the obtained luminescent signal data using the NumPy library from Python. The Z-score calculations were done using the following formula: Z = 1 \u2212 [3 \u00d7 (\u03c3p + \u03c3n)/|\u00b5p \u2212 \u00b5n|], where \u03c3p corresponds to the SD of positive control wells and \u03c3n to negative controls or to INH wells (containing 200 \u00b5M docking inhibitors in trans), while \u00b5p and \u00b5n are the averages (calculated from 6 wells from two plates).\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms241914854/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: \u00c1.L.P., A.A., and A.R. conceived the project and wrote the manuscript; \u00c1.L.P., A.A., and L.D. carried out the experiments; L.D. and K.P. contributed to the development of RSKPhALC and MAPK-PhALC assays, respectively; the cyclic peptides were synthesized by C.B. and Z.B.
