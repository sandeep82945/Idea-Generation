Here, we revisit the question of its efficacy in the presence of noisy pulses in scenarios important for quantum devices today: pulses with gate control errors, and the computational setting where DD is used to reduce noise in every computational gate. We focus on the well-known schemes of periodic (or universal) DD, and its extension, concatenated DD, for scaling up its power. The qualitative conclusions from our analysis of these two schemes nevertheless apply to other DD approaches. In the presence of noisy pulses, DD does not always mitigate errors. It does so only when the added noise from the imperfect DD pulses do not outweigh the increased ability in averaging away the original background noise. We present breakeven conditions that delineate when DD is useful, and further find that there is a limit in the performance of concatenated DD, specifically in how far one can concatenate the DD pulse sequences before the added noise no longer offers any further benefit in error mitigation.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe adverse effects of noise pose some of the biggest challenges in realizing useful quantum technologies. The very quantum effects that give quantum technologies their edge over classical devices are also the obstacles to success: They are extremely fragile and easily destroyed by the presence of unwanted interactions with the environment noise. Much of the current research and technological push in the community are centered around exploring ways to reduce and remove the effects of noise in quantum devices [1, 2].\nAn effective noise-suppression technique is dynamical decoupling (DD), which requires the application of fast control pulse sequences on individual qubits to average away the effects of noise processes [3\u201311]. Advancing well beyond its root in control techniques for NMR systems, DD has been used in many different types of experiments as a viable way to combat decoherence in quantum information processing systems [12\u201318], alongside other applications such as noise spectroscopy [19] and quantum metrology [20]. Compared with quantum error correction (QEC) (see, for example, Ref. [21]), a more widely studied noise-removal approach, DD is much more economical as it requires no encoding of logical qubits using multiple physical qubits, nor real-time close-loop control through periodic syndrome measurement and recovery. All that is needed are regular single-qubit fast pulses that are usually easy to implement\u2014they employ the same gates used for quantum computational tasks that are typically part of the capabilities of the quantum device. DD can be used by itself, or as the first layer of defense against\nnoise within a standard QEC scheme as a hybrid noisereduction approach [22\u201324]. The use of DD does not, however, come at no cost. The multiple pulses that have to be applied can be imperfect. Imperfect DD pulses can add, rather than remove, errors in the system. When the pulses are too noisy, those added errors can happen often enough to eliminate the benefit of having DD in the first place [23].\nLike the concatenated codes in QEC, it is also possible to construct pulse schemes in a recursive manner to \u201cscale up\u201d the power of decoupling and form what is known as concatenated DD (CDD) [5]. In an ideal world, one could in principle construct arbitrarily accurate DD-protected gates through concatenation [25]. However, under realistic constraints such as control errors and finite pulse rate, both theoretical papers and experimental papers find that increasing concatenation may not always be beneficial [25\u201331].\nIn this work, we study the efficacy of DD as a noiseremoval technique when the DD pulses themselves are noisy by asking similar fault-tolerance questions usually asked of QEC procedures. Our investigation can be split into two lines of inquiry. First, for a given DD sequence, what is the maximum amount of noise in the DD pulses that can be tolerated, before DD stops offering any benefit? We refer to this maximum amount of tolerated noise as the breakeven point (it is also sometimes referred to as the pseudothreshold in QEC and fault-tolerance literature). Second, we ask for the accuracy threshold\u2014again borrowing terminology of QEC\u2014specifying the level of noise permissible in the DD pulses below which a given prescription for scaling up the DD scheme can remove\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n09 03\n9v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 4\nFe b\n20 23\n2 more and more noise, and hence attain better and better computational accuracy in the quantum device. As we will see, we find that, in typical situations, there is no nonzero threshold. Instead, there is a maximal scale for DD, beyond which no additional benefit can be derived.\nPast literatures involve some aspects of our queries. In particular, the performance of DD with imperfect pulses has been extensively studied with various models accounting for the effects of finite pulse width and systematic unitary rotation errors [26, 32\u201335]. A generic description of noisy DD has also been attempted using a stochastic process model [35]. Experimental evidence suggesting the adverse impacts of noisy controls are also available in many reports [27, 36, 37]. Among these studies on non-ideal DD, however, a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis from the fault-tolerance perspective is yet available to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, for a fully fault-tolerant discussion relevant to experiments today, more general noises for the pulses have to be incorporated. Experimentally, gate-control noise, which can arise every time a DD pulse is applied, is often of a very different nature than the background noise\u2014 assumed in the case of finite pulse widths\u2014in a quantum device, and can be highly dependent on the specific gate being applied. Such noise has to be treated separately in a realistic study of the efficacy of DD.\nHere, we focus our discussion on the most commonly used scheme of periodic DD (PDD) based on what is known as the universal decoupling sequence [3]. The same analysis, however, extends to other DD schemes. For scaling up the DD protection, to be able to remove more noise, we make use of CDD [5], organizing the DD pulse sequence in a recursive manner. We discuss the breakeven point in two operational settings: computation and memory. In the computational setting, we consider using DD to reduce noise in computational gates in the course of carrying out a quantum circuit. The breakeven comparison is thus about the noise per gate, with or without DD. In the memory setting, we instead compare the noise over a fixed time interval, during which DD can be carried out or not. Most of our discussion will be in the computational setting, the one most relevant to the current interest in quantum devices, though we mention the memory setting in specific cases. Following past papers, we quantify the performance of DD using the error phase, namely, the strength of the effective noise Hamiltonian\u2014 with and without DD\u2014acting on the qubits in the quantum device. As we will see, the error phase permits easy analytical treatment. We numerically check for consistency with another natural figure of merit, the system state infidelity, in a specific physical setting.\nBelow, we begin in Sec. II with a few basic concepts needed for our analysis. Section III discusses the breakeven point for PDD, starting with the ideal-pulse situation before moving to the realistic noisy case. We examine the example of unitary errors in detail, numerically exploring the infidelity measure in addition to the analytical treatment of the error phase. Sec. IV extends\nour discussion to the case of CDD and explores the existence of an accuracy threshold for DD. We conclude and summarize our findings in Sec. V."

            "text": "DD involves the repeated application of a fixed sequence of short pulses (or fast gates) to individual quantum registers that average away the effect of any noise with a time scale slow compared to the sequence time. For a given DD scheme, let L be the length, i.e., the number of pulses, of the sequence. We denote the ith pulse of the sequence as Pi, and write the sequence as PL . . . P2P1, proceeding from right to left in time. Pulse Pi is applied at time ti = ti\u22121 + \u03c4i, for i = 1, 2, . . . , L, with \u03c4i the time between pulses Pi\u22121 and Pi, and t0 is the time of the last pulse of the previous sequence, coincident with the start time of the current sequence; see Fig. 1.\ncircuit:\nmodel:\nAll DD schemes share some fundamental similarities. First, all DD pulses are chosen from a specific transformation group. Second, all DD sequences must satisfy the constraint that in the absence of errors, PLPL\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7P1 is the identity map (up to a phase factor). This constraint ensures that there is no net transformation on the quantum register at the completion of the sequence. Different strategies could differ in the following respects: (i) the transformation group.\u2014For a qubit register, a common choice is the Pauli group generated by the Pauli operators X and Z. Simpler schemes such as spin echo [38] and the\n3 CPMG sequence [39] use only the subgroup {I, Z}. (ii) The specific sequence of pulses, which can be deterministic as well as randomized [6]. (iii) The pulse times.\u2014One can have regular-interval pulses, with \u03c4i \u2261 \u03c4 \u2200i, as is the case in PDD [3] and CDD [5] schemes. One could, however, have variable-interval schemes, such as the Uhrig DD sequence and its variants [7, 11, 40]. It is also possible to apply continuous control that follows a Eulerian cycle instead of using the \u201cbang-bang\u201d style control [41]. In this work, we focus on the regular-interval schemes of PDD and CDD, differing in sequence length and the specific pulse sequence, but which employ pulses drawn from the Pauli group. The physical model we are considering is one where gates, including the DD pulses, are applied at some operating frequency, with time \u03c4 in between consecutive gates. Such nonzero \u03c4 can simply be the finite switch time between gates, or there may be other practical reasons for a synchronized clock cycle time.\nGenerally speaking, the errors can be attributed to two major sources: (i) the system (quantum register) interacting with its environment (local quantum bath and field fluctuations, etc.), which constitutes the background noise on the system presenting even in the absence of control; (ii) the control imperfections. In many past works, imperfect DD pulses were modeled as finite-width (or finite-duration) pulses during which the always-on system-bath interaction acts and leads to errors in the pulses. Our approach, explained in Sec. III B 1, allows additionally incorporating general control errors in the pulses as well. This second source of errors is perhaps more dominant and relevant in practical situations. In the followings, we refer to the DD sequences with perfect, instantaneous pulses as ideal DD, and to the case with imperfect pulses as noisy DD.\nIn the absence of any DD pulses, the system and bath evolve jointly according to the Hamiltonian H, assumed to be time-independent as is appropriate for standard DD analysis [42]. H here can be written as H = HB + HSB, with HB as the bath-only Hamiltonian, and HSB the interaction. No system-only term appears in H as we assume no nontrivial dynamics, other than that arising from HSB, occur in the system during the course of a DD sequence. Computational gates, if any, can only be done in between complete DD sequences for the noise averaging to work. With this, we can write the evolution operator for a single complete ideal DD sequence as\nUDD = PLe \u2212i\u03c4HPL\u22121 . . . P2e \u2212i\u03c4HP1e \u2212i\u03c4H \u2261 e\u2212i\u2126DD . (1)\nHere, we have defined \u2126DD \u2261 THeff as the dimensionless effective Hamiltonian appropriate for describing the evolution for the time T \u2261 L\u03c4 of the DD sequence. \u2126DD can be written formally using the Magnus expansion,\n\u2126DD =\n\u221e\u2211\nm=1\n\u2126 (m) DD , (2)\nwhere the mth term consists of products of m copies of \u03c4H, and hence is of order \u2016\u03c4H\u2016m. We refer the reader to\npast analyses of DD (see, for example, Ref. [23]) for a detailed derivation of the Magnus expansion. Here, we provide only the basic expressions needed for our discussion below. In particular, we will need the expressions for the three lowest-order Magnus terms for piecewise-constant Hamiltonian evolution. For U = e\u2212iOK e\u2212iOK\u22121 . . . e\u2212iO1 , for Ois a sequence of time-independent dimensionless Hamiltonians (e.g., O1 = \u03c4H), we have U \u2261 e\u2212i\u2126 with \u2126 = \u2126(1) + \u2126(2) + \u2126(3) + . . ., where\n\u2126(1) =\nK\u2211\ni=1\nOi,\n\u2126(2) = \u2212 i 2\nK\u2211\ni,j=1 i>j\n[Oi, Oj ], (3)\nand \u2126(3) = \u22121 6\nK\u2211\ni,j,k=1 i\u2265j\u2265k\n( [Oi, [Oj , Ok]] + [Ok, [Oi, Oj ]] )\nsym(i, j, k) .\nHere, sym(i, j, k) is the symmetry factor (equaling to 1 when i, j, k are all different, 2 when any two indices are equal and 6 when all indices are equal); [ \u00b7 , \u00b7 ] denotes the commutator. Within the radius of absolute convergence of the Magnus series [43],\nL\u2016\u03c4H\u2016 < 1.0868 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2248 1, (4)\n\u2126(m) decreases in importance as m increases. A DD scheme such that \u2126 (m) DD acts trivially on the system (i.e., acts as the identity on the system) for all m \u2264 n is said to achieve nth-order decoupling. For such a scheme, the system sees an effectively weakened noise, of strength \u2016\u2126(n)DD\u2016 \u223c \u2016\u03c4H\u2016n, compared with \u2016\u03c4H\u2016 without DD."

To increase the power of the DD scheme, one can employ the method of concatenation introduced in Ref. [5]. In that work, CDD was built upon the basic PDD scheme; the same procedure of concatenation, however, can be applied to other basic DD sequences as well [8, 9]. The idea is to make use of concatenation to increase the decoupling order of the resulting DD sequence, hence reducing the residual noise.\nCDD can be described in a recursive manner. We begin with the bare evolution, without any DD sequence, writing the evolution operator over time interval t as\nU0(t) \u2261 e\u2212itH0 , (9)\nwhere H0 \u2261 H, with the subscript 0 added here in preparation for concatenation to higher levels.

In the remainder of the paper, we will restrict our discussion to CDD built upon the basic PDD scheme. The authors of Ref. [5] showed that CDDn achieves nthorder decoupling. This quantifies the benefit of scaling up the noise protection by concatenation. Appendix D re-derives this conclusion with a different argument than that in the original reference."

The system and bath evolve jointly for some specified time T according to the evolution operator U(0, T ).

            "text": "Any noise mitigation strategy is effective only if its costs, i.e., the increased complexity of carrying out the computational task with noise mitigation, are lower than its benefits, i.e., the increased ability to reduce the adverse effects of noise on the computation. The costs enter\nnot just because any noise mitigation approach requires the use of more resources, e.g., more gates, more qubits, etc., but also that those added resources are themselves imperfect in practice, such that the unmitigated noise of the resulting larger system is unavoidably larger than if no noise mitigation strategy was adopted. There is then a net benefit only if the added noise is low enough to not overwhelm the added noise-removal capabilities. Such is the content of any fault-tolerance analysis (see, for example, Ref. [21]), usually applied to quantum computing tasks protected by quantum error correction. Here, we apply the same logic to DD, and ask when the added benefit of averaging away part of the noise outweighs the added cost of having to do additional pulses which are themselves noisy.\nFor a proper cost-benefit analysis, we distinguish between two operational scenarios: to better preserve states in a quantum memory (no computational gates), or to reduce noise in the course of carrying out a quantum computation. In the memory setting, the goal is to preserve an arbitrary quantum state for some storage time T . During this period, DD pulses are applied, and we can ask if the resulting noise is lower compared with the no-DD case over the same time period. In other words, for DD to work well, we require\nMemory setting: DD(T ) < (T ), (17)\nwhere (t) is some chosen figure of merit quantifying the noise associated with the time evolution over period t, with or without DD as specified by the subscript. In particular, for the quantum memory protected with an L-pulse DD scheme with constant interval \u03c4 , we have T = L\u03c4 . In the computational setting, instead of the same total evolution time with and without DD, we need to pay attention to the gate time, assumed to be common to both computational and DD gates. In the absence of DD, we assume computational gates are applied at the same rate as DD pulses, i.e., every time step \u03c4 . With DD, however, the protected computational gates are further separated in time by a factor L, the number of pulses in the DD cycle. The condition for DD to be effective in this case is then\nComputational setting: DD(L\u03c4) < (\u03c4). (18)\nIn our work, we are more interested in the computational setting, the more stringent one among the two, though it is straightforward to adapt our analyses to the memory case, as we do in some of the situations below. As we will see, Condition (18) will yield a requirement on the noise parameters characterizing the noise in the system and the DD pulses. We refer to this requirement as the breakeven condition for DD, borrowing terminology from quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n6 A. Ideal case\nLet us first discuss the breakeven condition for ideal PDD. We expect to recover the usual statement of when DD works at all, namely when the noise changes slowly compared with the time taken for a complete DD sequence. We choose the error phase as our figure of merit: \u2261 \u03a6. For PDD to be useful, we require, under the computational setting,\n\u03a6SB \u2264 \u03c6SB, (19) where \u03a6SB is the error phase with PDD, while \u03c6SB, as defined earlier, is \u2016\u03c4HSB\u2016, the error phase without DD, for a single time step \u03c4 . From our earlier discussion of PDD, we have \u03a6SB = \u2016\u2126(2)PDD + \u2126 (3) PDD + . . . \u2016. The full Magnus series is difficult to write down, but we can employ the dominant nontrivial (on the system) term, \u2126 (2) PDD, for the approximate condition:\n\u03a6SB ' \u2016\u2126(2)PDD\u2016 \u2264 \u03c6SB. (20)\nUsing the expression for \u2126 (2) PDD from Eq. (7), we have \u2016\u2126(2)PDD\u2016 \u2264 2\u03c42 ( 2\u2016[BI , Bx]\u2016+ \u2016[BI , BY ]\u2016+ \u2016{BX , BZ}\u2016 )\n\u2264 4\u03c6B\u03c4 ( 2\u2016BX\u2016+ \u2016BY \u2016 ) + 4\u03c42\u2016BX\u2016\u2016BZ\u2016\n\u2264 12\u03c6B\u03c6SB + 4\u03c62SB , (21) noting that \u03c6B \u2261 \u2016\u03c4HB\u2016 = \u2016\u03c4BI\u2016, and that \u03c6SB \u2261 \u2016\u03c4HSB\u2016 \u2265 \u2016\u03c4Bi\u2016 for i = X,Y, Z (see App. B). For the breakeven condition (19), it then suffices to require\n12\u03c6B + 4\u03c6SB \u2264 1. (22) Condition(22) amounts to a requirement that both \u03c6SB and \u03c6B be small for PDD to work well. We note that this condition is also sufficient for the convergence criterion, Eq. (4), as 4\u2016\u2126\u2016 \u2264 4\u03c6B + 4\u03c6SB \u2264 1, which in turn justifies the approximation of Eq. (20). The coefficients for \u03c6B and \u03c6SB contain a factor of 4 from the length of the PDD sequence. In general, a longer sequence will have a larger pre-factor and hence put a more stringent requirement on the noise to be small. That \u03c6SB has to be small comes as no surprise: \u03c6SB quantifies the strength of the noise on the system, and DD is expected to work well as long as the noise is weak enough so that the remnant noise is small. The requirement that \u03c6B be small is perhaps more surprising. After all, it bounds the bath-only term which does not directly lead to noise on the system. Nevertheless, HB determines the evolution rate of the bath (which can be made explicit in the Heisenberg picture of HSB defined by HB), while \u03c4 is the inverse rate for the control pulse. Hence \u03c6B quantifies how rapidly the bath evolves relative to the pulse, or how fast the noise is compared with the control. That \u03c6B should also be small should be understood as the additional requirement that the characteristic frequency of the bath should be low compared with the control, for good averaging over the entire sequence. These two requirements are consistent with the understanding of DD from the filter-function formalism [19]."

            "text": "We describe a noisy DD pulse in the following manner. We denote the actual ith DD pulse by P\u0303i, now regarded as a map on states, not just a unitary operator. P\u0303i can be obtained in an experiment through the use of process tomography methods, giving generally a completely positive (CP) and trace-preserving (TP) map [44]. P\u0303i can in reality be time-dependent in that the noisy pulse may be different in each DD cycle, but for simplicity, we assume no such time dependence. Each pulse is assumed to take time \u03c4P (the pulse width) to complete, during which a gate Hamiltonian Hi acts. In the ideal situation, Pi = e\n\u2212i\u03c4PHi ; in reality, during the gate action, the background Hamiltonian H = HB + HSB acts as well, and there can be additional gate control noise. We hence write the noisy pulse as\nP\u0303i = Ui \u25e6 Ei. (23)\nHere, Ui(\u00b7) \u2261 Ui(\u00b7)U\u2020i with Ui \u2261 ei\u03c4P (Hi+H), is the unitary map that accounts for the finite width of the DD pulse, with noise coming from the background Hamiltonian H. Ei \u2261 U\u2020i \u25e6 P\u0303i is a CPTP \u201cerror\u201d map that captures the gate control noise. Ei acts only on the system in the typical case. Splitting P\u0303i into the two maps as in Eq. (23) reflects the physical nature of the two noise sources and what we typically know about them: The noise arising from the background Hamiltonian scales as the pulse width, while the control noise (e.g., finite turnon/off times, misalignment issues, etc.) often does not. While one can view Ei (as we do below, mathematically) as one generated by a noise Hamiltonian, one often does not know that Hamiltonian source of noise but obtains Ei from tomography alone, as a map for the time step associated with the pulse.\nNow, if Ei is a unitary map, then Ei(\u00b7) = Vi(\u00b7)V \u2020i with Vi a unitary operator on the system. We can write Vi \u2261 e\u2212i\u0393i , where \u0393i is a Hermitian operator to be viewed as the dimensionless effective Hamiltonian for the control noise in the ith pulse. Even for a non-unitary CPTP map Ei (the typical case), we can \u201cdilate\u201d the system to include an ancillary system such that Ei arises from a unitary map on the system-ancilla composite, with Ei obtained after tracing over the ancilla. According to the Stinespring dilation theorem of a quantum channel, it suffice to incorporate at most a d2-dimensional ancilla\n7 space for the d-dimensional system [45]. For the analytical treatment below using the error phase, we will always assume this dilation, and treat all noise as unitary Ei with a dimensionless effective Hamiltonian \u0393i. The ancillary system needed for the dilation is treated as part of the bath. We thus write the noisy pulse finally as P\u0303i(\u00b7) = P\u0303i(\u00b7)P\u0303 \u2020i , with P\u0303i a unitary operator on the system and bath defined as\nP\u0303i \u2261 e\u2212i\u03c4P (Hi+H)e\u2212i\u0393i . (24)\nNote that every \u0393i can be taken to have no pure-bath term, i.e., it does not have a term proportional to I on the system. Such a term gives rise only to an overall phase on the system and cannot result in observable imperfections in the pulses.\nWe assume that \u2016\u0393i\u2016 \u2264 \u03b7 for all i, where \u03b7 is a dimensionless parameter that carries the meaning of a controlnoise strength. In experimentally relevant scenarios, we expect \u03b7 to be small. Also, \u03c4P is usually chosen to be small compared to \u03c4 , for fast pulses that minimize the effect of H while the pulse Hamiltonian acts. We define \u03b4 \u2261 \u03c4P /\u03c4 1. There is no particular relation between the small parameters \u03b7 and \u03b4, and we will consider the leading-order contributions from both terms."

Thus, gate-independent control noise affects PDD only at order \u03b72 and higher. We can understand this as the PDD sequence averaging away also the constant\u2014over the PDD sequence\u2014noise that comes from the imperfect pulses, just as it does the time-independent HSB. Put differently, the deviation from first-order decoupling from control noise enters only as the difference between the X\nand Z control noise, so that we can re-write \u2126\u0303PDD as\n\u2126\u0303 (1) PDD ' (4\u03c4)I \u2297BI + (4/\u03c0)\u03c4PY \u2297 (BX +BZ) (30)\n+X(\u0393Z \u2212 \u0393X)X + Z(\u0393Z \u2212 \u0393X)Z.

(31) Here, we have upper-bounded \u2016\u0393Z\u2212\u0393X\u2016 by 2\u03b7, the most general bound when there is no particular relation between \u0393Z and \u0393X , as would be the case for platforms where the two gates are applied by different methods. If, on the other hand, the control noise is only weakly gate-dependent, namely, that \u2016\u0393Z \u2212 \u0393X\u2016 \u2264 \u03b7\u2032 \u03b7, one can replace the 4\u03b7 in the breakeven condition Eq.

In this case, \u03b7\u2032 may also be comparable to the second-order Magnus terms (e.g., compared with \u03c62SB), and higher order corrections should be considered and included in the breakeven condition. We explore a concrete example of this in Sec. III C.\nIn the absence of gate control noise, i.e., \u0393X = 0 = \u0393Z , or, equivalently, \u03b7 = 0, we return to the case of finitewidth pulses already discussed in past literature. In this\n8 scenario, the breakeven condition becomes simply \u03b4 \u2264 \u03c08 , or, in terms of \u03c4P itself,\n\u03c4P \u2264 \u03c0\n8 \u03c4 ' 0.4\u03c4.

At the same time, we investigate the infidelity measure for and DD, as an alternative to the error phase, and compare the conclusions about the breakeven conditions.\nFor simplicity, we assume instantaneous pulses \u03c4P = 0 (since finite-width errors are already explored in existing literature) and that the noise is gate independent. Specifically, we write\n\u0393X = \u0393Z = \u03b7 n \u00b7 \u03c3, (34)\nwith \u03c3 \u2261 (\u03c3X , \u03c3Y , \u03c3Z) = (X,Y, Z), n \u2261 (nX , nY , nZ) is a real unit vector, and \u03b7 is a nonnegative constant quantifying the strength of the unitary error. Here, the \u0393s act only on the system and not on the bath. Since \u03c4P = 0 and the noise is gate independent, the first-order Magnus contribution to the effective with-DD interaction vanishes: \u2126\u0303 (1) PDD of Eq. (30) reduces to a bath-only term. The error phase is then second order in small quantities, and we need the second-order Magnus term to deduce the effective interaction Hamiltonian. Direct calculation yields,\n\u2126\u0303 (2) PDD = \u22124X \u2297 i\u03c42[BI , BX ]\u2212 2Y \u2297 ( i\u03c42[BI , BY ]\n+ {\u03c4BX + \u03b7nXI, \u03c4BZ + \u03b7nZI} ) .

A sufficient breakeven condition, neglecting higher-order corrections, can be obtained by restricting the above upper bound on the error phase \u03a6SB to be no larger than \u03c6SB. This gives the regions bounded by the\nwhite-dashed lines in the lower-left corners of Figs. 2(a)(c); for (d) and (e) in that figure, the breakeven condition cannot be satisfied for the chosen parameters.\nOne can regard \u03a6SB \u2264 \u03c6SB as a threshold condition for the gate control error \u03b7, for given \u03c6SB and \u03c6B.

For \u03c6B and \u03c6SB 1, as is usually the case in practice, this becomes \u03b7 . \u221a \u03c6SB/2. The square-root relation between \u03b7 and \u03c6SB comes directly from the fact that the gate-independent noise matters only at the second order when there is DD, compared with \u03c6SB that enters in the first order without DD.\nTo gauge how tight our analytical bounds are, which are general and applicable for all H and unitary \u0393, we numerically simulate the action of PDD for specific instances to find the breakeven conditions. At the same time, numerical analysis permits the investigation of figures of merit to quantify the performance of PDD, beyond the analytically accessible error phase that we have used thus far. Our conclusions about the breakeven conditions are useful only if they are reasonably consistent across different measures. Specifically, we examine the infidelity measure, already introduced in Sec.

BI is chosen such that tr(BI) vanishes, corresponding to fixing a choice for the zero-energy level. Specifically, we write BI = \u03c6Bv \u00b7 \u03c3 where v is a real 3D unit vector chosen uniform-randomly over the surface of a 3-sphere. In addition, we write Bi = Ri + R \u2020 i , where Ri is a complex random matrix with normally distributed entries. The resulting HSB is normalized and then multiplied by a chosen \u03c6SB to give the desired magnitude.\nThe error phase approach requires no specification of the initial bath state, as it quantifies the size of the full system-bath interaction Hamiltonian. The infidelity measure that we compute here, however, targets only the resulting system-only state, and the effective system-only noise channels depend on the choice of initial bath state \u03c1B. In those cases, we consider the infinite temperature state, i.e., the maximally mixed state, as a symmetric choice of bath state. The maximization contained in the definition of InF is carried out numerically with 10,000 samples over N and \u03c8.\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the numerical values of the ratio PDD/ (1), for the two different choices of the figure of merit , over the parameter space (\u03c6B, \u03c6SB), and for different \u03b7 values. Figs. 2(a-e) (top row), plotting the error\nphase results, show a rapid shrinking of the breakeven region, where DD remains effective, as \u03b7 increases from 0 to 0.14. The numerical breakeven regions are much larger than those predicted by the analytical condition of Eq. (37). The infidelity measure is plotted in Figs. 2(f-j) (bottom row). With InF, the breakeven regions are larger, indicating a difference in detailed conclusion from the error-phase measure. The contour shapes nevertheless follow a similar pattern as that of the error phase measure, suggesting a qualitative agreement between the two measures."

            "heading": "IV. SCALING UP PROTECTION: LIMITS OF CONCATENATION",
            "text": "Next, we turn to the situation of CDD, where we attempt to scale up the noise protection by concatenating a basic decoupling sequence to longer and more sophisticated sequences. The scaling strategy differs between the quantum memory scenario and the quantum computation scenario, as illustrated in Fig. 3. In the memory setting, the natural strategy is to slice the fixed evolution time T into finer and finer intervals to accommodate more and more DD pulses, until some minimal gate time is reached. In the computational setting, with the working gate time \u03c4 fixed, increasing the concatenation level will inevitably bring about a longer time between computational gates. Past analytical and numerical studies gave rather optimistic assessments of the scaling performance using the memory setting [5, 25, 27], while experimental and numerical studies in the computational setting produced mixed conclusions [26, 30, 32]. Below, we put our\nemphasis on the computational setting, the more relevant scenario for the current pursuit of high-fidelity gates for quantum computational tasks. We also adapt our analyses to the memory case for comparison.\nOne can certainly discuss the breakeven point for a particular CDDn sequence, treating it simply as a \u201cflattened\u201d sequence of pulses, and asking when the error\n10\nphase after CDDn is smaller than \u03c6SB as was done for PDD in the previous section. However, a more interesting question, given the CDD scheme of scaling up the protection by increasing the concatenation level, is the gain in noise-removing power for every increase in CDD level. A key concept in fault-tolerant quantum computing is the accuracy threshold, the noise strength below which scaling up the QEC code always gives improved protection against noise, and hence more accurate quantum computation (see, for example, Ref. [21]). Here, we ask the analogous question of CDD: Is there a condition on the noise parameter of the problem such that increasing the CDD level always leads to improved noise removal capabilities? Concretely, an accuracy threshold for CDD exists if the physical noise strength\u2014denoted symbolically here by \u03b7, though there can be many noise parameters that characterize the noise strength\u2014satisfies a condition \u03b7 < \u03b7thres, for some \u03b7thres > 0, such that\n\u03a6SB,n+1 < \u03a6SB,n, (38)\nfor every n = 1, 2, . . .. Here, \u03a6SB,n denotes the error phase for CDDn. The existence of an accuracy threshold means that every increase in CDD level is accompanied by a decrease in the resulting error phase, as long as the physical noise strength is below the threshold level. Note that Eq. (38) automatically implies the breakeven condition by recognizing that \u03a6SB,0 = \u03c6SB.\nUnfortunately, as we will show below, for CDD built from concatenating the PDD scheme, there is no such accuracy threshold in the computational setting, i.e., there is no nonzero \u03b7thres for which Eq. (38) holds for every n. Instead, we will see that the error phase initially decreases as n increases but eventually, this decrease turns around, and there is a maximal concatenation level beyond which the error phase actually grows with n. This maximal concatenation level hence quantifies the limits to the power of CDD, for given physical noise parameters. Below, we show this general behavior for both the ideal CDD case where pulses are perfect, and the noisy CDD case where imperfections in the pulses are allowed.\nAs mentioned earlier, both \u03c6B and \u03c6SB have to be small for DD to offer benefits. Depending on the relative sizes of these two terms, there are two very different regimes for understanding the CDD performance: \u03c6B/\u03c6SB 1 and \u03c6B/\u03c6SB & 1. Reference [5], the original work that introduced CDD, focused on the limit of \u03c6B/\u03c6SB & 1 (specifically, they assume \u03c6B > \u03c6SB while both are small), a limit they argue to be relevant when the system is coupled only to a small portion of the bath while the whole bath, with many degrees of freedom, has a nonzero self-interaction. The other limit of \u03c6B/\u03c6SB 1 is also potentially of physical interest, and represents an arguably better situation for DD, where the noise evolution is of secondary importance to the actual interaction between the system and bath. Here, we reexamine the situation of \u03c6B/\u03c6SB & 1 as done in [5] but now with gate-control noise. We also consider the opposite limit of \u03c6B/\u03c6SB 1 for the ideal case; we will see\nthat the qualitative behavior is, in fact, not that different. In that case, to obtain the leading-order behavior, we can simply assume BI = 0 in the physical Hamiltonian. The practical situation will likely be somewhere in between the two limits.\nA. Ideal case\n1. \u03c6B/\u03c6SB & 1\nWe first work in the limit of \u03c6B/\u03c6SB & 1 examined in Ref. [5], while distinguishing between the computational and memory settings. Here, the & symbol specifies that \u03c6B > \u03c6SB but both are similar in magnitude so that both can be considered to be of the same order in a perturbative expansion.\nWe focus on the computational setting for now. Following the analysis of Ref. [5], the effective Hamiltonian for CDDn can be written as\n\u2126CDDn = I \u2297 4n\u03c4BI +X\u2297(\u2212i)n2n(n+1)\u03c4n+1adnBI(BX) (39) + Y \u2297(\u2212i)n2n2\u03c4n+1adn\u22121BI ([BI , BY ]\u2212 i{BX , BZ}) + ( higher order terms ).\nWe confirm this leading-order behavior in Appendix D, an analysis needed also for our BI = 0 discussion below. CDDn thus indeed achieves nth-order decoupling in that the lowest-order system-bath interaction term is (n+1)th order in BI and/or B\u03b1; lower-order terms have been eliminated by the DD sequence. The pure-bath part, whose size can be approximated by\n\u03a6B,n ' 4n\u03c6B, (40)\nis of the first order. The remnant interaction part can be bounded in a straightforward manner using the leadingorder terms in Eq. (39), giving the error phase\n\u03a6SB,n . 2 (n+1)2\u03c6nB\u03c6SB. (41)\nThat \u03c6B enters the error phase should again be of no surprise. As in PDD, \u03c6B determines how quickly the noise seen by the system evolves, and hence affects the efficacy of DD designed to eliminate noise that remains unchanged for the full DD sequence. \u03c6B has to be small for DD to work well. What is perhaps more surprising is the 2(n+1) 2\nfactor in \u03a6SB,n. The origin of this factor lies in the exponentially increasing temporal length of the CDD pulse sequence as n increases, for fixed \u03c40 \u2261 \u03c4 (implicit in the \u03c6B and \u03c6SB quantities). This means that the error phase eventually increases for large enough n, as the exponentially decreasing \u03c6nB factor is eventually overcome by the super-exponentially increasing 2(n+1) 2\nfactor. This tells us, as anticipated in the introductory paragraphs to this section, that there is no accuracy threshold :\n11\nThere are no nonzero values for \u03c6B and \u03c6SB below which \u03a6SB,n+1 \u2264 \u03a6SB,n for all n. Instead, there is a maximal useful level of CDD, beyond which further concatenation actually increases the noise seen by the system. Fig. 4 plots this situation of fixed \u03c40, for increasing concatenation level n. We observe the initial decrease of \u03a6SB,n as n increases, but this turns around eventually (at n = 4 for the plotted situation).\nOf course, the above discussion is based on the upper bound for the error phase. We can only conclude that there is no threshold level of noise below which the upper bound on error phase decreases as n increases. A more careful discussion of the threshold should look at the original \u2126CDDn expression, rather than a bound. For that, we examine the actual map \u2126CDDn+1 \u2261 D(\u2126CDDn) that recursively gives the evolution as the CDD level increases, leading to Eq. (39). Stated in terms of the bath operators and neglecting higher-order terms, the map D is given by (see App. D), for n \u2265 0,\n\u03c4Bn+1,I = 4\u03c4Bn,I = 4 n+1\u03c4BI , (42)\n\u03c4Bn+1,X = \u22124i[\u03c4Bn,I , \u03c4Bn,X ], \u03c4Bn+1,Y = \u22122i[\u03c4Bn,I , \u03c4Bn,X ], \u03c4Bn+1,Z = 0,\nwhere Bn,\u03b1, for \u03b1 = I,X, Y, Z, refers to the bath operators in \u2126CDDn associated with \u03c3\u03b1 on the system for CDDn: \u2126CDDn = \u2211 \u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 \u2297 \u03c4Bn,\u03b1, with \u2126CDD0 \u2261 \u2126, and B0,\u03b1 = B\u03b1; the factor of \u03c4 that accompanies every B operator makes it a dimensionless quantity. Since Bn,Z=0 at this order of approximation for n \u2265 1, for the norm of the interaction part of \u2126CDDn to decrease as n increases, it suffices to require \u03c4Bn,X and \u03c4Bn,Y to each decrease in size as n grows. This happens if the map \u22124i[\u03c4Bn,I , \u00b7 ] is contractive, satisfied if 8\u2016\u03c4Bn,I\u2016 < 1. This gives a maximal concatenation level,\nnmax = d\u2212 log4(\u03c6B)\u2212 32e, (43)\nwhere d \u00b7 e denotes the ceiling function. At n = nmax, the update rules Eq. (42)] no longer give a contractive map, and the error phase can grow upon further concatenation. For \u03c6B = 0.001, this sufficient condition successfully predicts the nmax = 4 numerically observed in Fig. 4. The maximal concatenation level depends only on the norm of \u03c4BI here, but this need not hold in all settings. It is worth mentioning that in Refs. [26], the authors find through numerical investigations that an optimal decoupling strategy is CDD2, when compared with other schemes like PDD, Symmetric DD (a timesymmetrized version of PDD), and CDD4. The existence of such an optimal strategy is consistent with our observation of a maximal concatenation level here.\nThe existence of a maxima concatenation level, beyond which further concatenation increases\u2014rather than decreases\u2014the noise strength, does not technically contradict the statement that higher-order decoupling is achieved by higher-level CDD. Using decoupling order to quantify the degree of noise removal requires, in the first place, the convergence of the Magnus series, so that the (n + 1)-th and higher-order terms in the series are small corrections to the first n terms. However, if the DD scheme is designed such that the total time for the sequence grows exponentially with n, as is the case for CDD if \u03c40 is fixed as n increases, eventually, we violate the convergence criterion and the decoupling order stops being a reasonable indicator of successful noise removal.\nThat the total sequence time grows exponentially with n also provides the intuition to the non-existence of an accuracy threshold for CDD, and that CDD fails after some maximal level, even in the ideal (perfect pulses) case. As n grows, the sequence time grows as 4n\u03c4 in this computational setting where the per-pulse time interval is some fixed value \u03c4 independent of n. Recalling that DD works to average away noise that remains constant for the full sequence time, as n grows, the sequence time eventually becomes long compared to the time-scale of evolution of the noise, reducing the efficacy of the DD averaging. Eventually, the additional concatenation adds only to the total sequence time, without adding much noise-removal power, and we reach the maximal useful concatenation level beyond which further concatenation makes the total (over the full sequence time) noise worse.\nTo further confirm this intuition, it is useful to momentarily consider the memory setting appropriate for a a different physical situation: to have fixed \u03c4n = T \u2261 \u03c4 , so that the CDD sequence takes the same amount of time, regardless of n. This requires per-pulse time interval \u03c40 = \u03c4 4n for each n, so that the physical pulses are applied at shorter and shorter time intervals as the concatenation level increases, up to some practical limit in the pulse rate. In this case, the evolution can be written as\n\u2126n+1 = D(\u2126n/4), (44)\n12\nso that the recursive rules of Eq. (42) become\n\u03c4Bn+1,0 = \u03c4Bn,0, (45) \u03c4Bn+1,1 = \u2212 14\u03c42i[Bn,0, Bn,1], \u03c4Bn+1,2 = \u2212 18 i\u03c42[Bn,0, Bn,1], \u03c4Bn+1,3 = 0.\nThis gives\n\u2126n ' \u03c30\u2297\u03c4BI + \u03c31\u2297(\u2212i)n2\u2212n(n+1)\u03c4n+1adnBI (BX) (46) + \u03c32\u2297(\u2212i)n2\u2212n(n+2)\u03c4n+1adn\u22121BI ([BI , BY ]\u2212 i{BX , BZ}).\n\u03a6B,n = \u03c6B thus remains unchanged, while the error phase is reduced to\n\u03a6SB,n . 2 \u2212n2\u03c6nB \u03c6SB, (47)\nwhere we have dropped the sub-leading-order term. For reasonably bounded noise (\u03c6B < 2), the condition \u03a6SB,n+1 < \u03a6SB,n automatically holds for all n \u2265 0. The error phase is super-exponentially decreasing in n, suggesting\u2014in sharp contrast to the computational setting\u2014that the noise can be arbitrarily suppressed by increasing the CDD level, limited only by practical constraints on how small \u03c40 can be in the experiment.\n2. \u03c6B/\u03c6SB 1\nNext, we consider the situation where BI is negligible compared with B\u03b1 so that we effectively set BI = 0 (and hence \u03c6B) to the approximation order considered below. As mentioned earlier, one expects CDD to perform better in this case: DD is intended to remove slow\u2014compared with the gate times\u2014noise, the limiting situation being one where BI = 0 so that the noise in fact does not evolve by itself in the absence of the system. As we will see below, this BI = 0 limit, however, does not mean that an accuracy threshold for CDD exists. The behavior of CDD as the concatenation level increases in fact eventually resembles that of CDD with BI 6= 0. This can be understood intuitively once we recognize\u2014as we will see below\u2014that the CDD pulses cause a back-action\u2014 through the system-bath interaction\u2014on the bath itself, such that the effective BI after adding the DD pulses becomes nonzero, and eventually we get back the situation of the previous subsection.\nWhen BI = 0 (or of higher order in our approximation compared with B\u03b1), the terms in Eq. (39) for the effective Hamiltonian for CDDn vanish, except when n = 1 (the PDD case; there, we retain the \u03c32\u2297{BX , BZ} term). That expression is hence no longer useful beyond PDD, as is the case of the recurrence map Eq. (42). Both expressions came from considering only the first and secondorder Magnus terms for every n (see App. D).\nFor a non-vanishing contribution for n > 1, we first consider the third-order term for n = 1, the PDD case;\nwe will see why, momentarily. Straightforward algebra gives, for negligible BI ,\n\u2126 (3) PDD = 2 3\u03c4\n3 [ iI \u2297 ( [BZ , {BX , BY }]\u2212 [BY , {BX , BZ}] ) +3\u03c3z \u2297 {BX , {BX , BZ}}]. (48)\nFor PDD, this third-order correction is sub-leading order, compared with the non-vanishing second-order \u2126 (2) PDD, and can be neglected in the PDD analysis. However, we see that this third-order term gives rise to a nonzero B1,0, the bath operator associated with the identity on the system in \u2126PDD. This term arises solely from the HSB bath operators BX , BY , and BZ , and can be thought of as a back-action on the bath due to its interaction with the system.\nGiven the recursive structure of CDD, this means that, while at level n = 1, the PDD analysis has BI = B0,0 = 0, at the next level n = 2, we no longer have this nopure-bath-evolution situation, since B1,0 6= 0, albeit of a higher order. If we begin our recursion map D at n = 2, rather than n = 1, using \u2126PDD as the base dimensionless Hamiltonian in place of the physical \u03c4H, we are in essence back in the previous case where the pure-bath evolution is no longer vanishing. The former form of D as specified in Eq. (42) thus holds for n \u2265 2, with now the base case as n = 1, not n = 0, with the B1,\u03b1s given by \u03c4B1,0 \u2261 i 23\u03c43 ( [BZ ,{BX , BY}]\u2212[BY,{BX , BZ}] ) +O(\u03c64SB) \u03c4B1,1 \u2261 0 +O(\u03c64SB) (49) \u03c4B1,2 \u2261 \u22122\u03c42{BX , BZ}+O(\u03c64SB) \u03c4B1,3 \u2261 2\u03c43{BX , {BX , BZ}}+O(\u03c64SB).\nThe dimensionless Hamiltonian for CDDn is then estimated for n \u2265 2, following Eq. (39), as\n\u2126CDDn ' \u03c30 \u2297 4n\u22121\u03c4B1,0 (50) + \u03c32\u2297(\u2212i)n\u221212(n\u22121) 2 \u03c4nadn\u22121B1,0(B1,2).\nHere, we have kept only the lowest-order terms that contribute to HB,n and HSB,n, keeping in mind the various \u03c4B1,\u03b1s are of different orders of magnitude: \u03c4B1,0 and \u03c4B1,3 \u223c \u03c63B, \u03c4B1,1 \u223c O(\u03c64SB), and \u03c4B1,2 \u223c O(\u03c62SB).\nIn this case, the error phase for level-n CDD can be bounded as\n\u03a6SB,n . 2 n(n\u22121)\u2016\u03c4B1,0\u2016n\u22121\u2016\u03c4B1,2\u2016\n. 2n\n2+3n\u22122 3n\u22121 \u03c63n\u22121SB = ( 8 3 )n\u22121 2n 2+1\u03c63n\u22121SB , (51)\nnoting that \u2016\u03c4B1,0\u2016 . 163 \u03c63SB and \u2016\u03c4B1,2\u2016 . 4\u03c62SB. Comparing this with the error phase bound of \u03a6SB,n \u223c \u03c6nB\u03c6SB, the current situation of BI = 0 gives a faster suppression of \u03c63nSB as n increases. The numerical prefactor still grows exponentially with n, however, so we still expect the accuracy threshold for CDD to vanish even in this case. Figure 5 plots the error-phase bound for this\n13\nBI = 0 case for \u03c6SB = 0.001. This shows the same qualitative behavior as in Fig. 4, where BI 6= 0, though the maximal n value is larger in this BI = 0 situation.\nA similar analysis as in the \u03c6B/\u03c6SB & 1 regime leads to an analogous maximal concatenation level for CDD to offer benefit in this BI = 0 setting,\nnmax = d\u22123 log4(\u03c6SB) + log4 3\u2212 52e, (52)\nwhere we have used the fact that Bn+1,0 = 4 nB1,0 for n \u2265 2. For \u03c6SB = 0.001, this gives nmax = 14, which agrees with the maximal n level observed in Fig. 5. We note that, compared with the \u03c6B/\u03c6SB & 1 regime of the previous subsection, this \u03c6B 1 situation presents much more favorable conditions for the performance of CDD, both in terms of the smallest achievable error phase and the maximal concatenation level (c.f. Figs. 4 and 5). The inset to Fig. 5 shows the maximal useful CDD level as a function of \u03c6SB, using Eq. (52). We see that DD becomes useful when \u03c6SB . 10\u22120.25 ' 0.56, an improvement compared with the prediction of the generic Condition (22) (with \u03c6B = 0, giving \u03c6SB . 0.25) based on a loose bound. These results support the intuition that DD performs better in the \u03c6B \u03c6SB regime, although the quantitative behavior, in particular the existence of a maximal concatenation level, is similar in both."

            "heading": "B. Noisy CDD",
            "text": "Next, we discuss the CDD performance when the DD gates themselves are noisy. In particular, we are interested in the strength of the combined noise by studying how the error phase upper bound will evolve with the CDD concatenation level. Since we want to understand the limitations of CDD, we focus only on the \u03c6B/\u03c6SB & 1\nregime, the scenario with poorer CDD performance, as explained earlier.\nWith imperfect control, the iterative map D of the ideal situation gets modified by the noise, and we write \u2126\u0303CDDn+1 = D\u0303(\u2126\u0303CDDn) for n \u2265 0, where, as before, a tilde indicates the noisy version of the quantity, and we have \u2126\u0303CDD1 \u2261 \u2126\u0303PDD and \u2126\u0303CDD0 \u2261 \u2126. The use of the same noisy map D\u0303 stems from the fact that the same physical gates\u2014with the same noise\u2014are used to implement CDD at every level. The error phase, namely, the norm of the\ninteraction part of each \u2126\u0303CDDn, is denoted as \u03a6\u0303SB,n. The accuracy threshold condition under noisy control is given by\n\u03a6\u0303SB,n+1 \u2264 \u03a6\u0303SB,n, (53)\nfor every n. From our earlier discussion, we understand that there is no accuracy threshold even with perfect control, but it is still meaningful to study how noise can adversely impact the error phase at each level. For each n, the recursive nature of CDD allows us to view Eq. (53) as the breakeven condition for noisy PDD, with \u2126 replaced\nby \u2126\u0303CDDn\u22121. We thus simply need to understand how \u03a6\u0303SB,n and \u03a6\u0303B,n evolve as n increases, and make use of the PDD breakeven conditions discussed in Sec. III.\nWe consider the computational setting, with only gatecontrol noise and, for simplicity, instantaneous pulses (\u03c4P = 0). The noisy X and Z gates are written as\nX\u0303 = Xe\u2212i\u0393X and Z\u0303 = Ze\u2212i\u0393Z , (54)\nwhere we recall that \u0393X and \u0393Z describe the gate-control noise, and are generally operators on both the system and the bath. We write \u0393X(Z) \u2261 \u22113 i=1 \u03c3i\u2297\u0393X(Z),i where \u0393X(Z),i acts only on the bath. \u0393X(Z), as previously noted, can be taken to have no pure-bath term, and \u2016\u0393X(Z)\u2016 \u2264 \u03b7. Our earlier calculation [Eq. (30)] for noisy PDD gives, as the first-order Magnus term,\n\u2126\u0303 (1) PDD ' (4\u03c4)I \u2297BI + 2Y \u2297 (\u0393X,2 \u2212 \u0393Z,2). (55)\nFrom this, we know that the pure-bath term approximately (ignoring higher-order corrections) quadruples in size with every concatenation level,\n\u03a6\u0303B,n ' 4\u03a6\u0303B,n\u22121 = 4n\u03c6B. (56)\nFor the interaction part, the first-order Magnus expression gives a term with norm bounded by 4\u03b7. Since CDDn is just PDD on CDD(n\u2212 1) with the same noisy gates, this term will occur unchanged at all concatenation levels, giving (again, ignoring higher-order correc-\ntions) \u03a6\u0303SB,n . 4\u03b7, an n-independent bound. This is the appropriate estimate of the error phase if \u03b7 is dominant over the \u03c6SB and \u03c6B terms that arise in the second-order Magnus term. In the opposite limit, where \u03b7 \u03c6SB, \u03c6B, we should recover the ideal PDD behavior, where the first-order Magnus term has no interaction piece, and\n14\nthe leading order correction is the second-order Magnus term [Eq. (7)] for ideal PDD. In this case, we es-\ntimate \u03a6\u0303SB,n as in Eq. (21), with \u03c6SB and \u03c6B replaced\nby \u03a6\u0303SB,n\u22121 and \u03a6\u0303B,n\u22121, respectively, the noise parameters from CDD(n\u2212 1) . Putting the two limits together, we can estimate the error phase as,\n\u03a6\u0303SB,n . 12\u03a6\u0303B,n\u22121\u03a6\u0303SB,n\u22121 + 4\u03a6\u0303 2 SB,n\u22121 + 4\u03b7, (57)\nnow valid for all values of \u03b7. Equations (56) and (57) give a pair of recurrence relations that tells us how the noise parameters evolve as n increases.\nIntuitively, we can understand the origin of the maximal useful CDD level of concatenation by combining the recurrence relations with the PDD breakeven condition. From our understanding of PDD in Sec. III, we know that the breakeven condition for PDD identifies a bounded region for \u03c6B and \u03c6SB. Yet, we see here that \u03a6\u0303B,n\u2014which\nenters the bound for \u03a6\u0303SB,n\u2014grows without bound, indicating that there is no accuracy threshold, i.e., no values of the noise parameters for which Condition Eq. (53) is satisfied for all n. Such is to be expected, given our conclusion for ideal CDD. We can, moreover, determine the maximal useful CDD level of concatenation from this: The maximal level corresponds to the n such that the\n(\u03a6\u0303B,n, \u03a6\u0303SB,n) pair just crosses the boundary determined by the PDD breakeven condition. We illustrate this point in Fig. 6(a), where three different systems with control noise levels \u03b7 = 10\u22123, 10\u22126, and 10\u221210 are explored, indicated in red, orange, and blue shades, respectively. Figure 6(a) plots the regions bounded by the breakeven conditions for those systems, and simulates the evolution of\n(\u03a6\u0303B, \u03a6\u0303SB) for the effective Hamiltonian as one increases the concatenation level, for the same starting values of\n\u03c6B = \u03c6SB = 0.001. Since log(\u03a6\u0303B) is linear in n (see Eq. (56)), the concatenation level can be alternatively read off from the horizontal axis. For small enough \u03b7, we observe a similar behavior as in the ideal CDD case: \u03a6SB,n first decreases then increases as n grows, and we can identify a maximal n beyond which scaling up CDD gives no further benefit. That maximal n value is the very last level where its previous level still lies within the breakeven region (not counting the boundary). For \u03b7 = 10\u22123, we see that even n = 1 is of no use: The error phase \u03a6SB,n for every n is larger than if no DD is used, as the bare Hamiltonian lies on the breakeven boundary to begin with.\nAgain, we can examine the memory setting for comparison. In that case, \u03a6\u0303B,n ' \u03c6B is approximately constant across the concatenation levels, while the error phase, following a similar logic as above, updates according to the rule,\n\u03a6\u0303SB,n . 1\n2 \u03c6B\u03a6\u0303SB,n\u22121 + 4\u03b7. (58)\nAssuming the upper bound provides a good estimate of the actual quantity, we solve this recursive relation to\nobtain,\n\u03a6\u0303SB,n ' ( 12\u03c6B)n\u03c6SB + 4\u03b7\n1\u2212 12\u03c6B , (59)\nkeeping terms up to order n + 1 in small quantities. As\nlong as \u03c6B < 2, \u03a6\u0303SB,n decreases as n increases. However, unless the control pulses are perfect, there will always be an n-independent remnant\u2014the second term in Eq. (59) proportional to \u03b7\u2014that will limit how small\n\u03a6\u0303SB,n can be, not to mention the eventual limit in n when \u03c4(= T/4n) for this memory setting gets too short to be feasible. As illustrated in Fig. 6(b), the error phase reduces and plateaus to the same order as \u03b7 as one increases the concatenation level. Thus, in this case of\n15\nnoisy pulses, there is a limit in the error suppression capability of CDD, determined entirely by the size of the gate control noise. Hence, arbitrary noise suppression with CDD is not possible with imperfect control even in the memory setting. Note that this conclusion does not\nrely on us equating \u03a6\u0303SB,n with its upper bound above, but simply results from the linear-in-\u03b7 term in Eq. (55)."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "In this work, we studied the question of the fault tolerance of DD, namely, the efficacy of DD schemes in the presence of imperfections in the very pulses that carry out the DD operations. Our results are summarized in Table I. We examined first the breakeven conditions on the noise parameters for single-level PDD, and then we analyzed the performance of CDD. We saw that, in the computational setting, of primary relevance today, there is generally a limit to the CDD concatenation level, beyond which further concatenation offers no added benefit. This is in contrast to the memory setting, where unlimited error suppression is possible in some cases: Here, we saw this for the case of ideal CDD, while the case of finite-width pulses gave similar conclusions in Ref. [5]. In the case where gate control noise dominates, CDD faces a limit even in the memory setting, determined by the strength of the gate control noise.\nThat CDD faces a limit eventually is simply a reflection of the fact that the benefit, namely the error suppression capability, of CDD fails to grow sufficiently fast to compensate for the added cost, namely the additional gate control noise, from the increased number of pulses needed for larger n. It is easy to understand how this arises in the computational setting: Even in the case of ideal pulses, the exponential lengthening of the pulse sequence time as the CDD level increases means a relative increase in the noise evolution rate [see Eq. (56)]\u2014whether the noise changes quickly or slowly is relative to the pulse sequence time\u2014until eventually, for large enough n, the noise changes much faster than the pulse sequence time, and DD stops being effective. This is exacerbated by imperfections in the pulses, with the limiting n reached earlier than in the ideal case; see Fig. 6(a) as an example. In contrast, the memory setting sees no such relative increase in noise evolution rate as, in this case, all CDDn sequences, for any n, are assumed to take the same total time.\nThat gate control noise sets a limit to the error sup-\npression capability of CDD can also be understood intuitively. Any gate-dependent errors is equivalent to noise that changes during the pulse sequence and hence cannot be effectively averaged away by the DD sequence. This is in contrast to any gate-independent noise, which includes noise that arises from the finite-width pulses due to the always-on and time-independent HSB during the pulse application. Such static noise\u2014referred to as \u201csystematic errors\u201d in Refs. [5]\u2014can be removed by the DD sequence. Note that Refs. [5] hinted at some robustness of CDD against what they termed \u201crandom errors\u201d, as opposed to systematic errors. Our gate-dependent gate control noises are closer to the random errors mentioned in Refs. [5], but they are not quite random enough for truly randomized averaging effects, hinted at in Ref. [5], to kick in. Yet, such kinds of gate-dependent errors are generic in experiments today, with the same noise statistics manifesting each time the same gate is applied.\nWhile we chose PDD and CDD as our focus here, the insights gained from them apply to arbitrary scalable DD schemes. As long as the DD pulse sequence gets longer as one scales up, the above intuition that the noise evolution rate increases relatively continues to hold true, and one again expects a limit in the efficacy of CDD.\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that, even though we conclude here that there is a limit to the usefulness of CDD concatenation in the realm of realistic pulses, we should remember that CDD is anyway not meant as the final solution to noise in a quantum computing device. Instead, it is a lower-level means to remove slow noise, with higher-level methods like error correction taking over eventually to eliminate any remnant noise. The advantage of CDD, over that of error correction, is its much lower-resource requirements, and this remains a key consideration in near- to middle-term quantum devices. One can simply employ CDD to the maximum n limit, weakening the noise as much as possible, before switching over to more expensive, but more powerful, quantum error correction."

            "text": "Here, we relate the error phase (see Sec. II D 1) and infidelity (see Sec. II D 2) measures. We consider the system and bath evolution for some time T , with effective dimensionless Hamiltonian \u2126 (U(T, 0) = e\u2212i\u2126), using the appropriate \u2126 for the bare evolution without DD, or in the case with DD. Given our context of weak noise and slow evolution of the bath for good DD performance, we assume \u2126 to be small in norm and write down the system-bath evolution as a power series in \u2126 using the Baker-Hausdorff lemma [46], so that we have\nN (\u03c1S) = trB { U(T, 0)(\u03c1S \u2297 \u03c1B)U(T, 0)\u2020 }\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n(\u2212i)n n! trB { ad\u2126(\u03c1S \u2297 \u03c1B) } , (A1)\nwhere ad\u2126 is the map ad\u2126(\u00b7) \u2261 [\u2126, \u00b7 ]. With this [see Eq.

(A1). This allows us to examine the infidelity measure as a series also in \u2126, with the leading orders giving an approximate expression.\nTo further evaluate the fns, we note two identities,\ntr{\u03c8adA(\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c1B)} = 0, (A3) and trB adB = 0, (A4)\nwhere A is an arbitrary system-bath operator, while B is a bath-only operator, i.e., acts nontrivially only on the bath. Eq. (A3) immediately tells us that the firstorder term f1(N , \u03c8) always vanishes. For the secondorder term, we first write \u2126 = \u2126B + \u2126SB with \u2126B \u2261 I\u2297 trS \u2126 as the bath-only part, and \u2126SB \u2261 \u2126\u2212\u2126B is the system-bath term.

In the main text, we had used this inequality in the context where Bis are the bath operators associated with \u03c3is on the system in the interaction Hamiltonian HSB.\nProof.

Here, adA is the map adA(\u00b7) \u2261 [A, \u00b7 ], and 1\u2212e \u2212adA\nadA should be understood in terms of a Taylor\nseries,\n1\u2212 e\u2212adA adA =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n(\u22121)n (n+ 1)!

(C4)\nWe want to write eA+\u03b3B as a power series in \u03b3,\neA+\u03b3B = eA(1 + \u03b3C +O(\u03b32)), (C5)\nfor some C.

This gives, immediately, formula Eq. (C2), as desired.\nArmed with Eq. (C2), we can work out, say, K3. We first observe that e\u2212iK3 \u2261 Z\u0303ei\u03c4PHZ = Z\u0303Zei\u03c4PZHZ = Z\u0303Zei\u03b4\u21263 , for \u21263 \u2261 Z\u2126Z = \u03c4ZHZ. We compute Z\u0303Z:\nZ\u0303Z = Ze\u2212i(\u03c4PHZ+\u03b4\u21263)e\u2212iZ\u0393ZZ (C7)\n=\u0307 { 1\u2212i\u03c4P \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n(\u2212\u03c0)n (n+ 1)!

We also note that eA=\u0307Z, where we recall that the notation =\u0307 denotes equality up to an overall phase.\nNow, recall that H = \u22113 \u03b1=0 \u03c3\u03b1 \u2297 B\u03b1.

Observe that (adZ) 0(ZHZ) = (adZ) 0(hZ)+I\u2297BI +Z\u2297 BZ , and for integer n > 0, (adZ) n(ZHZ) = (adZ)\nn(hZ). It is easy to show that, for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .,\n( adZ 2i )n (hZ) = { (\u22121)n/2hZ , n even, (\u22121)(n\u22121)/2h\u2032Z , n odd,\n(C8)\nfor h\u2032Z \u2261 X \u2297BY \u2212 Y \u2297BX .

            "heading": "Appendix D: Ideal CDD dynamics",
            "text": "Here, we analyze the dynamics of the system under ideal CDD pulses, giving the derivation to Eq. (39) and related statements used in the main text.\nThe theory of Lie groups guarantees the existence of a homeomorphism between the Lie-group elements around I and its Lie-algebra elements in the vicinity of 0. This suggests a one-to-one correspondence between the unitary dynamics Un for CDDn and the Hermitian generator \u2126CDDn \u2261 i log(Un) when noise is weak. It is more convenient to focus on the generators and regard DD as transformation among them as n changes. At the base level, we have the bare Hamiltonian \u2126 \u2261 \u03c4H. For n = 1, CDD gives \u2126CDD1 \u2261 \u2126PDD, which can be expressed as a series \u2211\u221e m=1 \u2126 (m) CDD1 through the Magnus expansion, as we have done in the main text. To characterize this process, we introduce the decoupling maps D and D(m), defined as\n\u2126CDD1 = D(\u2126), \u2126(m)CDD1 = D(m)(\u2126), (D1)\nwith D \u2261 \u2211\u221em=1D(m) following the Magnus series. In particular, D(1)and D(2) are explicitly given in Eqs. (6) and (7). Higher-level concatenations are defined iteratively,\n\u2126CDDk+1 = D(\u2126CDDk) = \u221e\u2211\nm=1\nD(m)(\u2126CDDk). (D2)\nBacktracking from level n to level 0, we have \u2126CDDn = (D)n(\u2126). In the end, \u2126CDDn can be expanded as a Magnus series in the bare Hamiltonian.\n\u2126CDDn = ( \u221e\u2211\nm=1\nD(m) )n (\u2126) = \u221e\u2211\nm=1\n\u2126 (m) CDDn, (D3)\nwhere \u2126 (m) CDDn \u223c \u2016\u2126\u2016m is the mth-order term in \u2126.\nThere is no analytical solution to the full \u2126CDDn. But to estimate CDD dynamics, it suffices to find an analyt-\nically solvable estimator \u2126\u0302CDDn that reflects the leadingorder behavior of the full series. We need the leadingorder behavior of the pure-bath part and system-bath coupling separately, as the two pieces can be of different orders in small quantities, and we make use of them separately in our analyses. Formally, we define an estimatorerror pair,\n\u2126CDDn = \u2126\u0302CDDn + \u03b4\u2126CDDn. (D4)\nFor an accurate estimator, the error term \u03b4\u2126CDDn must be of higher-order smallness than the estimator, both in the pure-bath part and in the coupling. To quantify this statement, we introduce a two-component norm for any operator O with a split into the bath-only and systembath coupling terms: \u2016|O|\u2016 \u2261 (\u2016OB\u2016, \u2016OSB\u2016). Here, we are interested in the two-component norm of both\n\u03b4\u2126CDDn and \u2126\u0302CDDn. Accuracy of our estimation scheme demands\n\u2016|\u03b4\u2126CDDn|\u2016\u2261(\u03b4\u03c6B,n, \u03b4\u03c6SB,n) \u2016|\u2126\u0302CDDn|\u2016\u2261(\u03c6\u0302B,n, \u03c6\u0302SB,n), (D5)\nfor every n. Here, \u03c6\u0302B(SB),n and \u03b4\u03c6B(SB),n denote the norms of the pure-bath (system-bath coupling) parts of\n\u2126\u0302CDDn and \u03b4\u2126CDDn, respectively. The comparison is implied for both components separately, and should be understood as a comparison of the leading powers of the polynomials, i.e., a smaller polynomial has a larger leading power.\nReference [5] constructed an estimator by keeping the first two Magnus terms for each iteration step. In our notation, we write this as\n\u2126\u0302CDDk+1 \u2261 ( D(1) +D(2) ) (\u2126\u0302CDDk). (D6)\nWe explicitly decompose \u2126\u0302CDDk as \u2211 i \u03c3i \u2297 B\u0302k,i. Eq. (7) suggests that B\u0302k,Z vanishes beyond the first level of concatenation. This gives a simple update rule that connects higher concatenation levels,\n\u03c4Bn+1,I = 4\u03c4Bn,I (D7)\n\u03c4Bn+1,X = \u22124i[\u03c4Bn,I , \u03c4Bn,X ], \u03c4Bn+1,Y = \u22122i[\u03c4Bn,I , \u03c4Bn,X ], \u03c4Bn+1,Z = 0.\nAfter a little bit of algebra, the estimator can be shown\n20\nto be\n\u2126\u0302CDDn = I \u2297 4n\u03c4BI +X\u2297(\u2212i)n2n(n+1)\u03c4n+1adnBI(BX) (D8) + Y \u2297(\u2212i)n2n2\u03c4n+1adn\u22121BI ([BI , BY ]\u2212 i{BX , BZ}).\nTo track orders, we focus on the leading powers in \u03c4 , ignoring any coefficients. According to Eq. (D8), we have,\n(\u03c6\u0302B,n, \u03c6\u0302SB,n) ' (\u03c4, \u03c4n+1). (D9)\nTo show that \u2126\u0302CDDn is indeed faithful, \u03b4\u03c6B,n and \u03b4\u03c6SB,n need to be of higher-order smallness compared to \u03c6\u0302B,n and \u03c6\u0302SB,n. Indeed, we claim that\n(\u03b4\u03c6B,n, \u03b4\u03c6SB,n) . (\u03c4 3, \u03c4n+2). (D10)\nWe prove this assertion by mathematical induction.\nProof. For n = 1, the estimation error comes solely from the series truncation error, which is led by the third-order term,\n(\u03b4\u03c6B,1, \u03b4\u03c6SB,1) = \u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u221e\u2211\nk=3\n\u2126 (k) PDD\n\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2223\u2223\u2223 ' (\u03c43, \u03c43). (D11)\nAt higher truncation levels, the estimation errors are also supplemented with contributions from the lowerlevel terms. Formally,\n\u03b4\u2126CDDn+1 = D(\u2126CDDn)\u2212 (D(1) +D(2))(\u2126\u0302CDDn) (D12)\n= D(1)(\u03b4\u2126CDDn) + \u221e\u2211\nm=2\nD(m)(\u2126CDDn)\u2212D(2)(\u2126\u0302CDDn),\nwhere we have used the fact that D(1) is a linear map. To properly bound the size of the error term, we take the two-component norm on both sides of Eq. (D12) and apply the triangle inequality:\n(\u03b4\u03c6B,n+1, \u03b4\u03c6SB,n+1) . \u2016|D(1)(\u03b4\u2126CDDn)|\u2016 + (D13) \u2016|D(2)(\u2126CDDn)\u2212D(2)(\u2126\u0302CDDn)|\u2016+ \u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u221e\u2211\nm=3\nD(m)(\u2126CDDn) \u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2223\u2223\u2223.\nWe need to show that the right-hand side is bounded by (\u03c43, \u03c4n+3).\nReference [5] demonstrated that the higher-order Magnus series \u2211\u221e m=3D(m)(\u2126\u0302CDDn) is small. However, Eq. (D12) suggests that this argument is not sufficient, as the estimation error \u03b4\u2126n+1 comes not only from the truncation error at the same level, but also propagates up from the lower-level error \u03b4\u2126CDDn. Let us examine the size of these terms. The first term in (D13) is straightforward,\n\u2016|D(1)(\u03b4\u2126CDDn)|\u2016 = (4\u03b4\u03c6B,n, 0) ' (\u03c43, 0). (D14)\nTo bound the second term in (D13), we need to calcu-\nlate the difference between the full \u2126CDDn and \u2126\u0302CDDn after applying D(2). Using the explicit expression for the second-order Magnus term, we obtain\n\u2016|D(2)(\u2126CDDn)\u2212D(2)(\u2126\u0302CDDn)|\u2016 (D15) ' (0, \u03b4\u03c6B,n\u03c6SB,n + \u03c6B,n\u03b4\u03c6SB,n) ' (0, \u03c4n+3),\nwhere we have applied the induction hypothesis \u03c6B,n ' \u03c6\u0302B,n ' \u03c4 and \u03c6SB,n ' \u03c6\u0302SB,n ' \u03c4n+1. The final term in (D13) involves an infinite sum of Magnus terms higher than the third order. Since the series is led by the thirdorder term, which can be explicitly bounded, we have\n\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u221e\u2211\nm=3\nD(m)(\u2126CDDn) \u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2223\u2223\u2223 ' \u2016|D(3)(\u2126CDDn)|\u2016 (D16)\n. (\u03c62SB,n(\u03c6B,n + \u03c6SB,n), \u03c6SB,n(\u03c6B,n + \u03c6SB,n) 2) ' (\u03c42n+2, \u03c4n+3).\nThe estimation for D(3)(\u2126CDDn) can be done by explicitly calculating the third-order Magnus term for PDD, whose expression is not relevant here. Since all three terms are bounded by (\u03c43, \u03c4n+3), so is their sum. This proves our assertion Eq. (D10).\nWe have now shown that the estimator constructed through Eq. (D6) is indeed accurate. This leads to the conclusion that ideal CDDn indeed achieves nth-order decoupling, with leading-order behavior given by \u2126\u0302n in Eq. (D8), which is also Eq. (39) in the main text."
