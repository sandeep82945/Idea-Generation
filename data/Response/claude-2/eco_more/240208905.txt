 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct empirical studies to validate the mathematical model connecting microeconomic interactions and macroeconomic dynamics. For example, survey people about their time preferences and consumption patterns, and analyze the data to see if it matches the model predictions. 

2. Extend the model to incorporate other microeconomic interactions like exchange, interest, debt, redistribution, and mutual aid. See how these impact macroeconomic factors beyond just time preference.

3. Examine how different social norms across cultures modulate time preference and inequality. Compare more individualistic versus collectivist cultures. 

4. Study the neuroscience underlying the "grass is greener" psychological bias. Use fMRI to see how brain regions involved in social comparison are activated.

5. Develop agent-based simulations with more realistic agent behaviors and interactions. For example, have agents adapt their behaviors over time, or include demographic factors like age.
