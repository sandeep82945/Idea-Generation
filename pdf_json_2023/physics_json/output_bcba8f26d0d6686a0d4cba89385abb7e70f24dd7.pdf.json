    "abstractText": "We report a novel hydrogel for pre-concentration, fluorescent labelling, and light-triggered release of proteins for detection of low abundance biomarkers. The hydrogel was a co-polymer of acrylamide/bisacrylamide and methacrylamide attached to fluorescein isothiocyanate via a light cleavable bond and a poly(ethylene glycol) spacer arm of molecular weight of 3400 g mol. Unlike previous work, proteins were captured by an irreversible chemical reaction rather than by non-covalent affinity binding or physical entrapment. Because the protein-reactive group was attached to fluorescein, which in turn was coupled to the hydrogel by a photocleavable bond, on release the protein was labelled with fluorescein. Our hydrogel offered a pre-concentration factor of up to 236 for a model protein, streptavidin. Each protein molecule was labelled with 85 fluorescein molecules, and 50% of the proteins in the hydrogel were released after UV exposure for \u223c100 s. The proteins released from the hydrogel were captured in biotinylated microtitre plates and detected by fluorescence, allowing measurement of at least 0.01 ppm (or \u223c166 pM) of protein in sample solutions. The reported hydrogel is promising for detection of low abundance proteins while being less laborious than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and less affected by changes in environmental conditions than label-free biosensors.",

Measurement of low abundance proteins is key for enabling early detection of diseases.6 A widely used method for the measurement of low abundance proteins is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).7 ELISA uses two antibodies where a capture antibody allows a target protein to be pulled out of samples and a detection antibody is labelled with an enzyme. A substrate is then added, which is acted upon by the enzyme to produce a fluorescent or coloured product. The fluorescence intensity or absorption is proportional to the concentration of the target protein. Furthermore, as each enzyme can act upon multiple substrate molecules, the signal is amplified, allowing measurement of low abundance proteins. ELISA, however, requires multiple adding and washing steps, and hence is laborious. The technique can be automated, but robotic handling systems are large and expensive. To address this challenge, ELISA has been implemented on microfluidic paper-based\nanalytical devices by controlling the flow rate and hence arrival times of reagents to the detection zone.8 The flow control requires patterning of paper and multiple layers which must be precisely aligned. Alternatively, label-free biosensors have been used to measure low abundance proteins. Unlike ELISA, label-free biosensors9 require only capture antibodies and rely on changes in refractive index,10\u201312 impedance13,14 or mass15,16 to determine the concentration of target proteins. However, label-free biosensors are prone to errors because of changes in environmental conditions such as temperature.17 To measure low abundance proteins using absorption or fluorescence, which are less sensitive but require simpler instrumentation and are more user-friendly than ELISA, proteins have been pre-concentrated using beads18 and electrophoresis.19\u201321 After pre-concentration, proteins are recovered, labelled with dyes or fluorophores, captured, and then detected. This implies that a series of disparate steps are currently needed, much like ELISA.\nPrevious work on the use of hydrogels for analysis has used non-covalent interactions with immobilised dyes,22 charged groups,23 cyclodextrins,24 nanoparticles25 and molecular imprinting26 to concentrate proteins in hydrogels. Release of the captured proteins has been by changing the swelling of the hydrogel by pH,3 temperature change1,2 or by degradation of the hydrogel using light27\u201329 or chemically.30,31 For example, Douglas et al.22 used N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) \u2013 acrylic acid (AAc) copolymer microparticles modified by a dye (Acid \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

The dye acted as an affinity reagent to non-covalently bind proteins. Although this approach preconcentrated proteins from urine, it did not label them on release, the microparticles were extracted from the sample by centrifugation and the release was performed using an elution buffer which diluted the captured proteins. Detection of the captured and released proteins was by western blotting. The use of the microparticles for detection of proteins characteristic of Lyme disease did, however, improve the limit of detection by a factor of 10, from 0.07 ppm without microparticles to 0.007 ppm using microparticles.\nHerein, we report a novel hydrogel for pre-concentration, fluorescent labelling, and light-triggered release of proteins. The pre-concentration was achieved by covalent capture of proteins in hydrogels having much smaller volumes than sample solutions. As shown in Fig. 1, the covalent capture of proteins was because of the reaction between primary amines in proteins with isothiocyanate group in fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)32,33 present in the hydrogels. As FITC is fluorescent, proteins were pre-concentrated and labelled in a single step. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, the FITC was attached to the hydrogel backbone via a photolabile group, o-nitrobenzyl,34\u201340 which exhibits controllable photoreactions with tunable absorption for wavelengths >300 nm.38,40 Thus, the release of the fluorogenically labelled proteins was triggered through the irradiation of the hydrogels with UV light (365 nm). As shown in Fig. 1, the released proteins were selectively captured and then measured using fluorescence detection.\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of our designed hydrogel for pre-concentration, labelling, and controlled release, streptavidin was used as an exemplar protein. The streptavidin used in this work was tagged with rhodamine so that fluorescence of rhodamine could be used to determine the protein concentration before and after incubation with our hydrogels. This in\nturn provided the pre-concentration factor. The designed hydrogels offered a pre-concentration factor of up to 236. Equally, the rhodamine label was used to study the light-triggered release kinetics of streptavidin from the hydrogels. We showed that 50% of streptavidin was released from our hydrogels in \u223c100 s. Finally, we showed that released streptavidin was labelled with 85 fluorescein molecules per molecule of the protein. The designed hydrogel when combined with capture of released streptavidin using biotin and fluorescence detection, allowed detection of at least 0.01 ppm (or \u223c166 pM) of the protein.\n2.Experimental"

The incorporation factor was defined as the ratio of the molar concentrations of the NVOC containing monomers in hydrogels (mhydrogel) and precursor solutions (mprecursor). The mhydrogel and mprecursor were estimated based on the absorbance of the hydrogel and precursor solutions at \u223c490 nm and using the molar extinction coefficient of fluorescein (Fig. S7, ESI\u2020). As shown in Fig. 5(d), the PEG-based methacrylamide monomers exhibited increased monomer incorporation factors when compared to the allylamide monomer. This was attributed to an increase in monomer reactivity (methacrylamide > allylamide)46 and the water solubility of the PEG-based monomers.

Similar results were obtained for the other prepared hydrogels, showing firstorder release kinetics up to 30 min of irradiation. This suggests that fluorescein, once released, can rapidly diffuse out of the hydrogel, but the non-linearity after \u223c30 min irradiation suggests that there might have been a small amount of irreversibly bound fluorescein remaining in the hydrogel.

The streptavidin used in this work was tagged with rhodamine so that fluorescence of rhodamine could be used to determine the protein concentration before and after incubation with hydrogels. This in turn provided the pre-concentration factor. Streptavidin was chosen because of its very strong and selective binding to biotin, which made it easy to capture in biotinylated microtiter plates after being released from hydrogels.\n3.3.1 Protein capture and pre-concentration. The functionalized hydrogels, which were prepared by co-polymerizing acrylamide/bisacrylamide and FITC-NVOC-PEG3400-methacrylamide monomers, were capable of protein capture because the isothiocyanate groups reacted with the terminal amine and primary amines in proteins.47 This was confirmed by submerging the formed hydrogels in 10 mL of 0.10 and 0.01 ppm (1.66 and 0.166 nM, respectively) RS solutions in PBS. As shown in Fig. 7, a majority of RS was lost from the solution after overnight incubation with a functionalized hydrogel. In\ncontrast, control experiments with unfunctionalized polyacrylamide hydrogels resulted in no significant loss of RS from solutions. The negligible reduction in fluorescence from the stock solutions exposed to the unfunctionalized hydrogels shows that the RS conjugate does not bind significantly in the absence of the FITC moiety (Fig. 7).\nSix functionalized hydrogels were prepared; three were incubated with 0.1 ppm RS solutions and the remaining three with 0.01 ppm RS solutions. As summarized in Table 1, the percentage of RS loaded in functionalized hydrogels was 77 \u00b1 8% and 94 \u00b1 6% for 0.1 and 0.01 ppm protein solutions, respectively. This is significant when compared to the lightresponsive hydrogels prepared by Klinger and Landfester,40 where proteins were trapped inside hydrogels as a result of decreased pore size arising from electrostatic interactions, where a protein loading of 53.2 \u00b1 7.4% was reported. Subsequently, the concentration of RS in functionalized hydrogels was estimated and the results are provided in Table 1. The ratio of concentrations of RS in hydrogels and stock solutions provided the pre-concentration factors, which as shown in Fig. 8(c), were estimated to be 192 and 236 for 0.1 and 0.01 ppm RS solutions, respectively. The slightly lower pre-concentration factor at higher protein concentration is though to be a result of saturation of the reactive groups in the hydrogel.\n3.3.2 Protein release and detection. Having demonstrated the loading of a model protein into the prepared hydrogels, the photolytic release of protein from the hydrogels was investigated. The loaded hydrogels were exposed to UV in short bursts of between 1 and 10 min while submerged in 3 mL PBS, kept in PBS for 30 min to allow for the released RS to diffuse out of the hydrogel, and then the PBS was collected. This process was repeated until no additional RS could be detected in the supernatant PBS.\nFig. 7 Emission spectra of (a) 0.1 and (b) 0.01 ppm RS solutions before and after overnight incubation with unfunctionalized and functionalized hydrogels, and (c) RS concentrations in solution and hydrogel.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Analyst, 2023, 148, 4127\u20134137 | 4133\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The resulting cumulative release of RS as a function of irradiation time is shown in Fig. 8(b). The experimental data shown in Fig. 8(b) when fitted to a single exponential rise did not give a good fit to the data (r = 0.966), but a double exponential rise to a maximum gave a good fit with a correlation coefficient of 0.9995, indicating that two processes take place during the photolytic release of captured RS. The first fast process accounts for about 54% of the RS released with a time constant of 1.124 min\u22121, while the second slower process accounts for the remaining 46% of the released RS with a time constant of 0.075 min\u22121. From this we can show that 50% of the RS was released in \u223c1.68 minutes, or \u223c100 s. The origin of these two processes is currently unclear but may be a result of slow diffusion of released RS from the deeper layers of the hydrogel.\nOne of the PBS solutions containing labelled protein collected from a hydrogel incubated with 0.01 ppm RS and exposed to UV light was dispensed into a biotin coated well of a microtiter plate. The released streptavidin was allowed to bind to biotin for 30 min and then a buffer wash was performed. This process allowed removal of any fluorescein dye, not bound to protein but released when the hydrogel was irradiated with UV-light. The well of the microtiter plate was illuminated with 470 and then 540 nm light. The resulting fluorescence spectra (see Fig. 8(c)) showed emission peaks corresponding to fluorescein and rhodamine, confirming that the released RS was successfully labelled with fluorescein. Fig. S7 and S8, ESI\u2020 show that the molar emission coefficient of fluorescein at 514 nm is \u223c10 times higher than rhodamine at 590 nm in RS. Based on this and considering the fluorescence emission intensities at 514 and 590 nm in Fig. 8(c), we estimate that the RS was labelled with \u223c17 fluorescein molecules per one molecule of rhodamine. As each streptavidin was labelled with 5 rhodamine molecules, we estimate that 85 molecules of fluorescein were attached to each streptavidin. One possible explanation of this observation is that the FITC\nTable 1 A summary of RS loading in hydrogels made by co-polymerizing FITC-NVOC-PEG3400-methacrylamide with acrylamide/bisacrylamide (molar ratio of FITC-NVOC-PEG3400-methacrylamide was 10%, volume of RS stock solution was 10 mL, volume of hydrogel was estimated to be 0.04 mL, and \u2021: determined by change in fluorescence emission)\nRS concentration before incubation with functionalized hydrogel (ppm)\nRS concentration after overnight incubation with functionalized hydrogel (ppm)\u2021\n% RS loaded in functionalized hydrogel\nAmount of RS in functionalised hydrogel (\u03bcg)\nRS concentration in functionalised hydrogel (ppm)\n0.10 0.0176 82% 0.824 20.6 0.0205 80% 0.795 19.9 0.0318 68% 0.682 17.1 0.01 0.0003 97% 0.097 2.4 0.0012 88% 0.088 2.2 0.0002 98% 0.098 2.5\nFig. 8 (a) Emission spectra of RS (excitation wavelength of 540 nm) released when hydrogels were irradiated with UV-light, (b) cumulative release of protein as a function of irradiation time, and (c) emission spectra of released after incubation with biotin coated microtiter plates and buffer wash (excitation wavelengths of 470 and 540 nm).\n4134 | Analyst, 2023, 148, 4127\u20134137 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The labelling of RS with large numbers of fluoresceins is beneficial for measurement of low abundance proteins.\nConclusions\nThis work reports a hydrogel for pre-concentration, labelling, and controlled release of proteins for their subsequent detection by fluorescence. The hydrogel was formed by co-polymerizing acrylamide/bisacrylamide with designed monomers. The designed monomers comprised of either fluorescein (F) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) attached to a polymerizable group via a light cleavable bond achieved using o-nitrobenzyl (NVOC). The polymerizable group was either allylamide or methacrylamide. A poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer arm may or may not be present between the NVOC and the polymerizable group. We showed that the incorporation of methacrylamide monomer with 3400 g mol\u22121 molecular weight PEG spacer arm (F-NVOC-PEG3400-methacrylamide) in hydrogels was \u223c65%, which was double that of the allylamide monomer without PEG. The other benefits offered by the F-NVOC-PEG3400-methacrylamide were water solubility, ease of preparation with high yield, and the fastest light-triggered release kinetics.\nBy replacing fluorescein with FITC in the monomers and subsequently the hydrogels, a model protein was captured by reaction of amines on the protein with the isothiocyanate group. The designed hydrogels offered a pre-concentration factor of 192 and 236 for 0.1 and 0.01 ppm of an exemplar protein, streptavidin. Once pre-concentrated, the proteins were released by UV irradiation, leaving a free protein with a fluorescein label. We showed that 50% of streptavidin was released from our hydrogels in \u223c100 s and was labelled with 85 fluorescein molecules per one molecule of the protein. The labelling of proteins with large numbers of fluorophores can allow measurement of proteins present at low levels. Finally, the designed hydrogel when combined with capture of released streptavidin using biotin and fluorescence detection, allowed detection of at least 0.01 ppm or \u223c166 pM of the protein.\nThe hydrogels developed in this work are promising for protein preconcentration, labelling and on-demand release. The developed hydrogel when used in combination with selective capture of labelled proteins and fluorescence detection offer potential for measurement of low abundance proteins in clinical samples, enabling early detection of diseases.\nAuthor contributions\nGupta did conceptualization, funding acquisition, project administration, resources, supervision, writing \u2013 review and editing.
