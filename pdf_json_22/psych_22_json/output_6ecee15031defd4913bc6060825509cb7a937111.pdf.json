Children were classified as 28 having normal vision or unilateral or bilateral impaired vision caused by significant eye conditions 29 based on detailed parental-structured questionnaire data on sight problems and treatment coded by 30 clinicians. Ten domains covering education, career, and social outcomes by age 30 were 31 investigated. 32 Results Adjusted regression models showed few differences by vision status. Bilateral impaired 33 vision was associated with increased odds of intending to remain in full-time education after statutory 34 school age (adjusted OR, 2.00; 95%CI: 1.08, 3.68) and of home ownership at age 30 (1.83; 1.01, 35 3.32). Impaired vision was not associated with intending to attend university. A significantly higher 36 proportion of parents of children with bilateral or unilateral impaired vision thought that their child 37 would not get the exam grades required to go to university than parents of those with normal vision 38 (29 or 26% versus 16%; p=0.026). 39 Conclusion Adolescents with impaired vision have broadly the same intentions/ambitions regarding 40 future education, careers and social outcomes as their peers with normal vision. The known 41 significant gaps in attainment in these domains amongst young adults with vision impairment is 42 therefore likely to be due to barriers that they face in achieving their ambitions. Improved 43 implementation of existing interventions is necessary to ensure equality of opportunities. 44",

We 79 report here our quantitative investigation of this question analysing data from the Millennium 80 Cohort Study (MCS), which has collected data longitudinal on health, well-being, education 81 and social outcomes of children as they transition to adulthood. 82\n83 Methods 84"

            "text": "The MCS is a birth cohort study of 18,827 children born in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2000-86 01.7 Households from socioeconomically disadvantaged and ethnic minority backgrounds 87\nwere intentionally oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for analysis of these typically 88 hard-to-reach groups. 7 This makes the cohort particularly suited for research on VI as the 89 risk of childhood VI is considerably higher among lower socioeconomic and ethnic minority 90 households.8 Data on development and family socioeconomic circumstances were collected 91 every 2-3 years. 92\nOur previous work9,10 identified MCS\u2019s members with vision problems at ages 3-7 years, the 93 age at which VI would have manifested in most children.8 This was used to dichotomise 94 individuals as having impaired vision or not, and future intentions were assessed up to the 95 age of 17 years. Adolescents with neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions (such as 96 Down syndrome) were excluded as these conditions could themselves impact both vision 97 and intentions.9,11 98\nThe MCS received overarching ethics approval from the Multi-Centre Research Ethics 99\nCommittee (MREC/03/2/022).12 This study drew on existing anonymised data, therefore 100 additional ethics approval was not needed for our analysis. 101\n102 Vision data 103 In the absence of a formal biomedical assessment of MCS, our ophthalmic team developed 104 and piloted a structured questionnaire that was administered by trained expert interviewers 105 to elicit any vision and eye conditions, which eye(s) affected, age when first suspected, any 106 treatment undertaken and formal certification for sight impairment at ages 3, 5, and 7 years. 107 The questionnaire comprised both open-ended answers where the expert interview recorded 108 parents\u2019 response verbatim, including taking information from medical correspondence 109 provided by the parents, as well pre-defined/precoded lists of the most common eye 110 conditions for the age group. At ages 5 and 7 years, previously recorded data were also 111 rechecked. Three clinical members of our team classified responses independently using a 112 conservative and hierarchical strategy that required diagnosis, forms of therapy, and age at 113 treatment to match consistently. Coding was based on the International Classifications of 114\nDiseases (ICD) and the extended taxonomy used in our previous national epidemiological 115 study of blindness in children,8 which has been successfully validated.9,10 We dichotomised 116 participants at age 7 years into either a) those with significant eye conditions causing any 117 level of impaired vision and/or those certified as sight impaired (full list in eTable 1) or b) 118 those without any eye condition causing impaired vision. We also distinguished between 119 unilateral and bilateral impaired vision (using the coded data on laterality and treatment) as 120 an indicator of severity based on knowledge of a \u2018gradient\u2019 of functional impact on 121 socioeconomic outcomes.13-15 122\n123\nIntentions regarding education, career and social outcomes 124\nThese outcomes comprised self-report at ages 14 to 17 years on various dimensions of 125 education, career, and social outcomes (see eTable 2 for questions and coding used in our 126 study; entire surveys are available at https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/millennium-cohort-127 study/). 128\nEducation \u2013 Members reported as 14-years-olds how likely they were to remain in full-time 129 education beyond statutory schooling age (16 years) and the main reason they might not 130 stay in full-time education. As 17-year-olds, they reported how likely they were to go to 131 university and the main reason for their view. Parents also reported on their view of the 132 likelihood that their child would go to university and from this, the agreement between child-133 parent pairs was derived. 134\nCareer \u2013 At age 17 years, participants reported what job they expected to be doing when 135 aged 30 years which were categorised using the Social Occupation Grouping SOC2000 136 Major Groups by the MCS team16 and then grouped into three groups by us (ordinal 137 categories 1: managers, senior officials, professional occupations; 2: associate professional 138 and technical; and 3: administrative, secretarial and skilled trades occupations, personal 139\nservice, sales, customer service, process plant and machine operatives, and elementary 140 occupations). 141\nSocial outcomes \u2013 At age 17 years, members reported on what they expected to have 142 achieved by age 30 including home ownership, having a good car, earning money, having a 143 worthwhile job, having children, being married, being famous, or other personal 144 achievements. 145\n146\nConfounders/covariates 147\nDue to the sociodemographic patterning in impaired vision and intentions,8,11,17,18 important 148 confounders were ethnicity, maternal education, and household income along with the 149 cohort member\u2019s sex, any special education needs (SEN i.e. not specific to vision as primary 150 and secondary reasons for SEN were not available nor information on contact with a 151 Qualified Teacher of Children and Young People with Vision Impairment (QTVI) but should 152 be inclusive of SEN), and parent\u2019s university expectations for their child,11,18,19 measured at 153 ages 7, 11, 14 and/or 17 years. See eTable 1 for detailed coding of covariates. 154\n155 Statistical analyses 156 Analyses were performed in R version 4.1.0.20 With most outcomes measured at age 17 157 years, the final study sample included all who participated at that age. To account for the 158 MCS survey design and attrition over time, sample weights were applied.21 There was 159 between 2 and 65% missing data, with the largest number of missing observations in 160 outcomes reported at age 17 (eTable 3). Logistic regression models adjusted by 161 confounders showed that missingness was positively associated with impaired vision, lower 162 socio-demographic characteristics as with \u2018lower\u2019 intentions/ambitions (eTable 4), therefore, 163 imputation would not be appropriate.22 Missing values were grouped as \u2018not present\u2019 for 164\nbinary outcomes and classified as \u2018do not know\u2019 for ordinal outcomes (turning them into 165 nominal). 166\n167 Chi-squared tests assessed differences by impaired vision in sociodemographic 168 characteristics, intentions, and the reasons for educational intentions. Regression models of 169 intentions were fitted to assess associations with impaired vision adjusted for confounders; 170 logistic models for remaining in full-time education, going to university, and social outcomes, 171 and multinomial models for university agreement by child-parent and occupation. Next, 172 interactions between impaired vision and sociodemographic characteristics (i.e. sex, 173 maternal education, and household income) were added to test for synergistic effects 174 associated with intentions and kept in the models if significant at \u03b1=0.05. Interactions 175 between impaired vision and ethnicity could not be estimated due to the low frequency of 176 some combinations. All models\u2019 assumptions were satisfied. 177\n178\nResults 179\nStudy population 180 The study sample comprised 9273 singletons who participated at least at age 17 years and 181 had no neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions (82 excluded) (Figure S1). The 182 overall proportion of adolescents with eye conditions that caused unilateral impaired vision 183 was 47 per 1000 (95% CI, 44-50), and mostly due to amblyopia and/or strabismus, whilst the 184 frequency of bilateral impaired vision was 5 per 1000 (4-6) and mainly accounted for by 185 children certified as sight impaired severely sight impaired and/or with conditions affecting 186 retina, optic nerve of visual pathways. The impaired vision groups had a higher proportion of 187 adolescents with lower maternal educational attainment, and general SEN history (Table 1). 188\n189\nTable 1.

There were no differences by vision status in intention to go 208 to university. 209\nIt was relatively rare for participants to intend to go to university whilst their parents 210 disagreed, therefore the discordant pairs were combined to express both directions. 211 Unilateral impaired vision was associated with reduced odds of participants and parents 212 agreeing on it being likely that the participant would go to university (0.72, 0.54-0.95). 213\nParticipants\u2019 reasons for intending or not intending to remain in full-time schooling or going to 214 university did not vary by vision status (Table 3). The majority (73%) reported they were 215 likely to go to university to improve their job prospects or pursue their career of interest. 216 However, significantly more parents of 17-year-olds with bilateral or unilateral impaired 217 vision thought that their child would not get the educational qualifications required to go to 218\nuniversity compared to parents of those with normal vision (29 or 26% versus 16%; 219 p=0.026). 220\nCareer at age 30 \u2013 There were no differences in terms of intended occupation (grouped in 221 three groups) by vision status. 222\nSocial outcomes at age 30 \u2013 Compared to adolescents with normal vision, those with 223 bilateral impaired vision had higher odds of thinking they would achieve home ownership 224 (1.83; 1.01-3.32). No other differences in intended social outcomes by vision status were 225 observed. 226\n227\n232\nDiscussion 233\nUsing a population-based birth cohort study, we found no meaningful adverse association 234 between impaired vision and the intentions and ambitions of affected adolescents in terms of 235 their future education, careers and key social outcomes when compared with their normally 236 sighted peers. Interestingly, those with bilateral impaired vision were more likely to intend to 237 remain in full-time education beyond 16 years and to expect to own a home by the age of 30 238 years. Reasons for being likely or unlikely to remain in full-time education or going to 239 university did not differ by vision status. Adolescents with unilateral impaired vision and their 240 parents were less likely to agree that they were going to university and these parents more 241 often reported they thought their child would not get the qualifications required to get into 242 university compared to child-parent pairs of those with normal vision. 243\n244\nStrengths of this study include the sample size of adolescents with unilateral or bilateral 245 impaired vision embedded in a representative birth cohort and thus provides an appropriate 246 comparison group with normal vision. A wealth of data has been collected longitudinally 247 which allowed an investigation of intentions/ambitions in both professional and personal 248 domains as well as some insights into the perspectives of both adolescents and their 249 parents. Data were collected at ages during the transition from statutory to further and higher 250 education and about outcomes into early adult life. As all outcomes were not rare (>10%), 251 the study had enough power to detect significant differences if present between the normal 252 vision group and impaired vision groups, including the much smaller bilateral impaired vision 253 group with the exception of the intention for occupation. The reason for not combining the 254 unilateral and bilateral impaired vision groups to increase statistical power is because they 255 are distinct clinical groups with different functional impacts on socioeconomic outcomes13-15 256 and combining them would dilute any differences present in the more severe bilateral 257 impaired vision group. A potential limitation includes the possibility for misclassification of 258 vision status through the use of parental reports of eye conditions and thereby may result in 259 biased associations. This approach has been verified previously9,10 and indirect validation is 260\nprovided by similarity in frequency of childhood impaired vision and causative conditions 261 observed in this study and those reported in similar UK population studies that involved 262 biomedical assessment.17 Attrition and missing data are common problems in cohort studies. 263 Here, attrition was addressed by using sampling weights21 and missing observations of 264 intentions were extensively examined and appropriately dealt with, limiting the potential bias 265 of the results.22 Although regression models were adjusted for the major confounders 266 identified in previous research,11,17-19 residual confounding cannot be ruled out, as in any 267 observational study. The MCS did not collect data on teachers\u2019 expectations for their 268 students to go to university, whether adolescents received support other than at school, and 269 whether adolescents and their parents were satisfied with support services received. These 270 factors would be important to investigate in future research. Finally, as in all observational 271 research, associations do not imply causality, however reverse causality is not the case as 272 childhood vision status precedes the later outcomes. 273\n274 There has been no similar research, to our knowledge, with which we can directly compare 275 our findings. However previous qualitative research has shown that most adolescents living 276 with impaired vision have well-considered education and career ambitions6 but also have 277 concerns about discrimination at work, independent living, driving in particular for boys, 278 intimate relationships and the implications of hereditary eye conditions.6 Our study now 279 quantified that the ambitions of adolescents living with impaired vision correspond closely to 280 those of their peers with normal vision. The fact that impaired vision was not associated with 281 lower ambitions or expectations in several domains - having a worthwhile job, earning a lot 282 of money, having a good car, being married, or having children - is striking, given the present 283 realities of adults living with VI in the UK. For example, 15% have a university degree 284 compared with 38% of adults without a disability,23 furthermore a higher proportion have no 285 educational qualifications (11% vs 6%, respectively)23 and much lower proportion are in paid 286 employment (57% vs 81%, respectively).4 Our findings suggest that the \u2018attainment gap\u2019 in 287\nadult life is at least partly attributable to the ambitions and intentions of adolescents living 288 with impaired vision not being fully realised. A combination of factors is likely to account for 289 this, including a lack of adequate and appropriate support in the transition from compulsory 290 schooling into further and higher education, and opportunities to enter into and remain in 291 employment. 292\n293 There is now extensive literature identifying the specific needs of children and young people 294 (CYP) with VI in terms of support for development and in educational settings24,25 295 recognising that most childhood VI in the UK and other industrialised countries is present at 296 birth or from early infancy.26 A formal assessment of educational needs, to develop and 297 agree the child\u2019s education and health care plan (EHCP)25,27 is the key catalyst for ensuring 298 adequate provision in the UK and is likely to be a key factor in educational attainment in 299 adult life3, yet around 80% of CYP with VI do not have such a plan28 as was in our study. 300 There are also significant variations in habitation support in the UK, which for CYP living with 301 VI is aimed at maximising independence at different developmental stages all the way to 302 adult life; worryingly given the findings of our study, adolescents aged 16 years and older are 303 the age group the least likely to receive this support.27 This is in turn also likely to be a key 304 factor in obtaining and retaining employment.27 The 2014 legal reforms related to special 305 educational needs provision in the UK have not been effective due to implementation 306 problems with considerable gaps in support provision, with suggested improvements not yet 307 widely implemented.29 Without accessible high-quality support services to help CYP with VI 308 through schooling and further and higher education, many will not achieve their potential. 309 Importantly, educational attainment is a stronger predictor of employment in adults with 310 impaired vision than it is for those without disabilities.30 Thus, educational provision is the 311 foundation for much that follows in adult life for CYP with VI. 312\n313 Given the striking associations between disadvantage and risk of VI in childhood8,9,17,26 and 314 the influence of socioeconomic status on educational aspirations,11,18 it is notable that we 315\nfound no synergistic interactions between impaired vision and the sociodemographic factors 316 associated with adolescents\u2019 intentions. 317\n318 Our findings that there is little to distinguish between the intentions/ambitions of adolescents 319 with unilateral impaired vision (the majority of whom had amblyopia) and those with normal 320 vision is consistent with our prior research by us10,21 and others31 that has shown that 321 amblyopia is not associated with adverse educational, occupational, or social outcomes into 322 adult life. Furthermore, children with amblyopia perform similarly well to their peers in early 323 cognition tasks and school tests.10,31 Together these findings should reassure families, 324 teachers and clinicians that amblyopia need not be considered a barrier to professional or 325 personal ambitions. 326\n327 We examined concordance between adolescents and their parents about the intention or 328 expectation of going to university. Interestingly we found that unilateral \u2013but not bilateral\u2014329 impaired vision was associated with reduced odds of adolescents and their parents agreeing 330 that they were likely to go to university. Since unilateral impaired vision was not similarly 331 associated with adolescents reporting directly that were likely to university, it seems that 332 parental concerns about their child\u2019s likelihood of obtaining the necessary school 333 qualifications to go to university explain the discordance. These concerns may reflect both a 334 lack of awareness (due to suboptimal communication between families and professionals)29 335 or a lack of availability of support32,33 to ensure children with impaired vision achieve their full 336 educational potential. This is important to address as parents\u2019 support is a strong predictor of 337 employment in young adults with VI.34 338\n339 Conclusion 340\nAdolescence is a key development stage and those living with VI face additional challenges. 341 In the general population, career aspirations in adolescence predict career attainment in 342\nearly adult life, even after controlling for family social background and general cognitive 343 ability.11 Despite a legislative framework to protect and support those living with disabilities, 344 there remain reduced opportunities for adults with impaired vision manifest in their lower 345 educational and employment attainments. Our study demonstrates the origin of these 346 disparities is not in the aspirations of affected individuals in their childhood or adolescence 347 but rather suggests is in the specific support and provision they receive to nurture their 348 abilities so that they can achieve full potential. 349\n350 Twitter Mario Cortina-Borja @cortina_borja and Jugnoo Sangeeta Rahi @Rahi_Eye_Vision 351 352 Acknowledgements We are grateful to the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), UCL Social 353 Research Institute, for the use of these data and to the UK Data Service for making them available. 354 However, neither CLS nor the UK Data Service bears any responsibility for the analysis or 355 interpretation of these data. 356 357 Contributors All authors met the ICMJE criteria for authorship.
