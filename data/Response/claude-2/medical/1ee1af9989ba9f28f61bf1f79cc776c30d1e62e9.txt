 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the effects of different exercise intensities (e.g. 50%, 75%, 85% HRR) on plasma Hcy levels and oxidative stress markers to determine the threshold for increases.

2. Investigate the impacts of acute exercise on Hcy and oxidative stress in populations with hyperhomocysteinemia or cardiovascular disease. 

3. Explore how factors like exercise duration, modality (e.g. resistance, HIIT), and nutritional status influence the Hcy and oxidative stress response to acute exercise. 

4. Determine if chronic exercise training attenuates the acute exercise-induced increases in Hcy and oxidative stress markers. 

5. Test whether nutritional interventions (e.g. creatine, vitamin B2/folate supplementation) can mitigate exercise-induced elevations in Hcy and oxidative stress.
