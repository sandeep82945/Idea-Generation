    "abstractText": "In this paper, we present a multiple-time-step integration algorithm (MTSA) for particle collisions in particle-resolved simulations. Since the time step required for resolving a collision process is much smaller than that for a fluid flow, the computational cost of the traditional soft-sphere model by reducing the time step is quite high in particle-resolved simulations. In one stateof-the-art methodology, collision time is stretched to several times the flow solver time step for the fluid to adapt to the sudden change in particle motion. However, the stretched collision time is not physical, the hydrodynamic force may be severely underestimated during a stretched collision, and the simulation of sediment transport may be sensitive to the stretched collision time. The proposed MTSA adopts different time steps to resolve fluid flow, fluid-particle interaction, and particle collision. We assessed the MTSA for particle-wall collisions as well as particle-particle collisions, determined the optimal iteration number in the algorithm, and obtained excellent agreements with experimental measurements and reference simulations. The computational cost of the MTSA can be reduced to about one order of magnitude less than that using the traditional soft-sphere model with almost the same accuracy. The MTSA was then implemented in a particle-resolved simulation of sediment transport with thousands of particles. By comparing the results obtained using the MTSA and a version of the stretching collision time algorithm similar to Costa et al. (2015), we found that stretching the collision time reduced particle stiffness, weakened particle entrainment, and affected some turbulence and particle statistics.

Since the time step required for resolving a collision process is much smaller than that for a fluid flow, the computational cost of the traditional soft-sphere model by reducing the time step is quite high in particle-resolved simulations. In one stateof-the-art methodology, collision time is stretched to several times the flow solver time step for the fluid to adapt to the sudden change in particle motion. However, the stretched collision time is not physical, the hydrodynamic force may be severely underestimated during a stretched collision, and the simulation of sediment transport may be sensitive to the stretched collision time. The proposed MTSA adopts different time steps to resolve fluid flow, fluid-particle interaction, and particle collision. We assessed the MTSA for particle-wall collisions as well as particle-particle collisions, determined the optimal iteration number in the algorithm, and obtained excellent agreements with experimental measurements and reference simulations. The computational cost of the MTSA can be reduced to about one order of magnitude less than that using the traditional soft-sphere model with almost the same accuracy. The MTSA was then implemented in a particle-resolved simulation of sediment transport with thousands of particles. By comparing the results obtained using the MTSA and a version of the stretching collision time algorithm similar to Costa et al. (2015), we found that stretching the collision time reduced particle stiffness, weakened particle entrainment, and affected some turbulence and particle statistics.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier March 28, 2023"

            "text": "Particle-laden two-phase flows are widely encountered in industrial engineering and natural environments (Balachandar and Eaton, 2010; Brandt and Coletti, 2022), such as aeolian sand and dust movement, sediment transport, and fluidized-bed processes. When simulating particle-laden flows, if the flow field surrounding particles is fully resolved, it is called a particle-resolved simulation. A number of different particle-resolved simulation approaches have been developed, like the immersed boundary (IB) method (Mittal and Iaccarino, 2005; Uhlmann, 2005; Luo et al., 2007; Breugem, 2012; Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich, 2012b; Zhou and Fan, 2014; Tao et al., 2018; Huang and Tian, 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Verzicco, 2023) and the distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM)/fictitious domain approach (Glowinski et al., 1999, 2001; Yu and Shao, 2007, 2010; Shao et al., 2012). Particle-resolved simulations have been widely used to obtain high-fidelity simulation data, which is greatly helpful for developing reduced-order models (Bagchi and Balachandar, 2003; Eaton, 2009; Homann et al., 2013; Tenneti and Subramaniam, 2014; Zhou and Fan, 2015; Akiki et al., 2017; Seyed-Ahmadi and Wachs, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Xia et al., 2022a,b) or studying the mechanism of the fluid-particle interactions (Uhlmann, 2008; Kidanemariam and Uhlmann, 2014b; Vreman, 2016; Vowinckel et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021).\nThe focus of the present paper is on the collision algorithm for particles in particle-resolved simulations. Particle collision modeling is essential in particle-resolved simulations, whether a particle-laden flow is in the dense regime (Kidanemariam and Uhlmann, 2014b; Vowinckel et al., 2014; Picano et al., 2015) or the dilute regime (Costa et al., 2020). Soft-sphere model (Hertz, 1882; Mindlin and Deresiewicz, 1953) is one of the most popular collision models in particle-resolved simulations when multi-particle contact frequently occurs. However, the traditional soft-sphere model (i.e., the soft-sphere model with physical collision time) can be inefficient when applied to particle-resolved simulations, as the time scale associated with particle collision is typically much smaller than that of fluid flow, particularly for rigid particles. This mismatch can lead to expensive computation if using the same time step to resolve particle collisions and advance fluid flow simultaneously. On the other hand, the stretching collision time algorithm (SCTA) (Feng et al., 2010; Papista et al., 2011; Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich, 2012a; Costa et al., 2015; Biegert et al., 2017; Rettinger and Ru\u0308de, 2022) was proposed as a remedy and has been shown to be successful in reproducing the\nparticle trajectories of particle-wall (Joseph et al., 2001; Gondret et al., 2002; Joseph and Hunt, 2004) and particle-particle (Yang and Hunt, 2006) collisions. In the SCTA, the collision time Tc was stretched to N times the flow solver time step \u2206tf (i.e., Tc = N\u2206tf ) since the fluid requires time to adapt to the sudden change in particle velocity during collisions. By stretching the collision time, the computational efficiency can be improved compared with the traditional soft-sphere model. The particle stiffness and damping coefficient are determined by the desired restitution coefficient en,d and collision time Tc. However, the SCTA can only retain the particle kinematic properties rather than the mechanical properties as it greatly reduces the physical stiffness. Most of the SCTA is based on a linear spring-dashpot system, and the stiffness and damping coefficients were determined by an algebraic expression (Izard et al., 2014; Kidanemariam and Uhlmann, 2014b; Costa et al., 2015; Ardekani et al., 2016). Other implementations are based on the Hertzian contact theory, which is nonlinear, and the stiffness and damping coefficients were determined by an optimization procedure (Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich, 2012a; Ray et al., 2015; Biegert et al., 2017). Rettinger and Ru\u0308de (2022) developed an efficient four-way coupled lattice Boltzmann-discrete element method using the stretching collision time algorithm. They found that the collision time Tc is a critical parameter of the method, which has a significant effect on the collision dynamics. The collision time should be stretched as Tc = 2.31Dp/cs to allow the fluid to adapt to the sudden change in particle velocity, where Dp is particle diameter and cs is the lattice speed of sound. Recently, different from the SCTA developed based on the soft-sphere model, Jain et al. (2019) proposed an algorithm based on the hard-sphere model, and the hydrodynamic forces are incorporated during the collision using a semi-implicit IB method (Tschisgale et al., 2018).\nAlthough the SCTA can significantly reduce the computational cost compared with the traditional soft-sphere model and reproduce the experimental results of particle-particle and particle-wall collisions successfully (Joseph et al., 2001; Gondret et al., 2002; Joseph and Hunt, 2004; Yang and Hunt, 2006), it has several significant drawbacks. First, particle stiffness in the SCTA is greatly reduced by stretching the collision time, which is not physical. Second, the artificially stretched collision time Tc should be large enough to get converged trajectory (Rettinger and Ru\u0308de, 2022). However, the hydrodynamic force during such an artificially long collision process is usually neglected and significantly underestimated, which may lead to erroneous predictions of turbulence statistics (Xia et al., 2020) and can be expected to also\naffect particle statistics in massive-particle-laden flows, like sediment transport. To avoid introducing a stretched collision time, Li et al. (2020) were the first to use the physical collision time Tc in particle-resolved simulations. They adopted single non-uniform grid points with O (105) grid elements to resolve the particle and lubrication force, yielding excellent agreement with experimental results. However, such an extra-high grid resolution is almost impossible in cases with a large number of particles.\nThe present study proposed a multiple-time-step integration algorithm (MTSA) to reproduce the experimental results (Joseph et al., 2001; Gondret et al., 2002; Joseph and Hunt, 2004; Yang and Hunt, 2006) and simulations (Costa et al., 2015) using the soft-sphere model with physical collision time on a uniformly coarse grid. The grid resolution is about Dp/\u2206x = O(10), where \u2206x is the grid spacing. To overcome the time scale mismatch problem, three different time steps are employed in the MTSA to resolve fluid flow, fluid-particle interaction and particle motion during particle collisions. The pressure Poisson equation is only solved at the fluid flow time step to reduce computational cost. When time is advanced to the same instant, the fluid and particle information will be updated and synchronized. The MTSA can reduce the computational cost of the traditional soft-sphere model by nearly one order of magnitude and avoids artificially reducing particle stiffness like the SCTA. Meanwhile, we validated the accuracy and convergence of the MTSA with experimental data (Joseph et al., 2001; Gondret et al., 2002; Joseph and Hunt, 2004; Yang and Hunt, 2006), numerical data (Costa et al., 2015), and a reference simulation using the traditional soft-sphere model with fine time steps. We also presented guidelines for determining the optimal values of the parameters in the MTSA. The MTSA was then applied to a sediment transport case with thousands of finite-size particles. The results of the MTSA were compared for the first time with those obtained by the SCTA to investigate the effects of particle stiffness in a particle-resolved simulation of sediment transport.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows. The governing equations and physical models for fluid flow and particle motion are given in \u00a72. In \u00a73, the MTSA is introduced. In \u00a74, the influence of the time substep size is systematically analyzed and discussed in particle-wall and particle-particle collisions to yield a universally optimal time substep size. The MTSA is further applied to a sediment transport case with thousands of finite-size particles, and the effect of particle stiffness is investigated. Finally, we present the main conclusions of the paper in \u00a75."

The subscript p refers to the quantities of particle p. The carrier and dispersed phases are coupled by the volume force f , which is calculated by the multidirect forcing IB method (Luo et al., 2007; Breugem, 2012). The governing equations of the carrier phase are discretized on a uniform staggered Cartesian grid, which is referred to as the Eulerian grid.\nA particle is discretized by a fixed grid attached to the particle surface, which is referred to as the Lagrangian grid. The quantities between the Eulerian and Lagrangian grid points are transferred through a regularized Dirac delta function \u03b4d (Roma et al., 1999).\nTo avoid the difficulty of directly calculating the surface integrals \u222e \u2202V\n\u03c4 \u00b7 npdA and \u222e \u2202V\nr \u00d7 (\u03c4 \u00b7 np)dA, these surface integrals are converted into volume integrals by means of a momentum balance over the volume occupied by a particle. The volume force f is transferred from the Eulerian grid to the Lagrangian grid. Based on the above operations, the equations of particle motion (3) and (4) can be rewritten as (Uhlmann, 2005; Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich, 2012b; Breugem, 2012)\n\u03c1pVp dup dt = \u03c1f d dt\n(\u222b\nVp\nudV ) \u2212\u03c1f Nl\u2211\nl=1\nFp,l\u2206Vl+(\u03c1p \u2212 \u03c1f )Vpg+Fp,lub + Fp,col,\n(5)\nIp d\u03c9p dt = \u03c1f d dt\n(\u222b\nVp\nr \u00d7 udV ) \u2212 \u03c1f Nl\u2211\nl=1\n(rl \u00d7 Fp,l)\u2206Vl + Tp,col, (6)\nwhere Nl is the number of Lagrangian grid points, Fp,l is the volume force on the Lagrangian grid point calculated by equation (B.3) of the IB method, and \u2206Vl = \u03c0\u2206x ( 12R2p +\u2206x 2 ) /(3Nl) is the volume of a Lagrangian grid cell (Uhlmann, 2005). The discretization schemes for these governing equations are given in Appendix B with details. According to the approximation of the hydrodynamic force (Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich, 2012a; Costa et al., 2015; Biegert et al., 2017), the hydrodynamic force is excluded during contact for particles with the Stokes number St = \u03c1puinDp/(9\u03c1f\u03bdf ) > 5, where uin is the particle impact velocity."

(b) When 0 \u2264 \u03b5 < \u03b5\u2206x, the IB method or a similar approach may underpredict the\nhydrodynamic force due to a lack of spatial grid resolution. As a remedy, a lubrication model based on asymptotic expansions of analytical solutions for the lubrication force in the Stokes regime can be employed (Brenner, 1961; Cox and Brenner, 1967; Cooley and O\u2019Neill, 1969). (c) When \u03b5 < 0, the collision model takes control of the particle, and the hydrodynamic force is neglected. It should be noted that neglecting the hydrodynamic force during a collision is a model assumption.\nWhen a particle approaches another particle or a wall with a finite relative velocity, fluid is squeezed out of the gap and the lubrication model can be employed to calculate the hydrodynamic force with the Stokes flow assumption (Brenner, 1961; Cox and Brenner, 1967; Cooley and O\u2019Neill, 1969).

To avoid introducing the stretched collision time, the physical collision time should be used (Li et al., 2020). The physical collision time Tc can be calculated by the physical properties of particle as (Zenit et al., 1997)\nTc = 7.894\n( m2p\nE\u22172uinDp\n)1/5 , (17)\nwhere E\u2217 is the equivalent elasticity of the collision system depending on Young\u2019s modulus E and Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd, which is expressed as follows:\n1\nE\u2217 =\n1\n\u03c0 ( 1 + \u03bd2p Ep + 1 + \u03bd2q Eq ) .

In fact, the\ncharacteristic time scales for fluid flow, fluid-particle interaction and particle collision are quite different in magnitude. We have estimated that the particle collision time can be 3 or 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the particle response time, and thus 1 or 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the flow time scale with St \u223c O(100). Using a very fine fluid flow time step \u2206tf to resolve particle collision can lead to a highly expensive computation. When employing a single large time step in a particle-resolved simulation, the error of the soft-sphere model is also large and mainly comes from two aspects. First, the particle motion cannot be well resolved by a large flow time step during a collision. It will result in an excessive overlap between colliding surfaces and overpredicting the rebounding trajectory, as shown in figure 1 of Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich (2012a). Second, particle velocity rapidly changes during a collision. The surrounding fluid can hardly follow this rapid change with a large flow time step. It may cause an overestimation of the hydrodynamic force by the IB method and underpredicts the rebounding trajectory, as shown in figure 8 of Costa et al. (2015). These two facts prevent the usage of the traditional soft-sphere model with a single large time step. On the other hand, as we have discussed in the introduction, artificially reducing particle stiffness like the SCTA is nonphysical and may also bring in errors in simulations (Xia et al., 2020).\nDue to the aforementioned drawbacks of the existing methods, we propose the MTSA employing a normal fluid flow time step while inserting additional two-level time substeps to resolve fluid-particle interaction and particle motion during a collision, so that the prediction errors by increasing particle stiffness can be significantly reduced and the computation efficiency is not degraded too much at the same time."

A single time step \u2206t is replaced by three different time steps, namely a fluid flow time step \u2206tf and additional two-level time substeps (i.e., fluidparticle interaction time substep \u2206ti and particle motion time substep \u2206tp) hierarchically inserted into it. As shown in figure 1, \u2206tf = Tc/Rf is employed to advance fluid flow, \u2206ti = Tc/Ri to advance fluid-particle interaction, and \u2206tp = Tc/Rm to advance particle motion. Here, Rf , Ri and Rm are the iteration numbers of fluid flow, fluid-particle interaction and particle motion substeps in one collision time Tc, respectively. Based on the above three parameters, Ni = Ri/Rf and Nm = Rm/Rf can be defined as the iteration\nnumbers of fluid-particle interaction and particle motion substeps in one fluid flow time step. It should be noted that Ni and Nm should be integers, which restrict the choices for Ri and Rm.\nThe pressure Poisson equation is only solved at the fluid flow step t = tf , which greatly improves the computational efficiency of the MTSA. Local pressure is assumed to be a constant at the fluid-particle interaction and particle motion substeps in a fluid flow step. At a fluid-particle interaction substep t = ti, we solve the flow momentum equation, calculate the IB force, and modify the fluid velocity by the IB force accordingly. At a particle motion substep t = tp, we calculate particle collision and motion. When the time is advanced to the same instant, the information of the fluid flow and particle will be updated and synchronized. The updating and synchronizing process are demonstrated by the arrow lines in figure 1. Particularly, when t = tf = ti = tp, the particle position and velocity at t = tp are updated to the particle-fluid interaction substep before calculating the IB force. Second, the IB force is calculated and used to modify the fluid velocity at t = ti. Third, the calculated IB force at t = ti is synchronized to the fluid flow step as the input for particle motion, and the modified fluid velocity at t = ti is also updated as the input for the Poisson equation. Fourth, the Poisson equation and flow field at t = tf are solved and updated. Finally, the updated fluid velocity at t = tf is synchronized to t = ti and t = tp as the input for\nthe flow momentum equation and particle motion. When t 6= tf , we only update the particle position and velocity.\nIn the MTSA, an explicit second-order Runge\u2013Kutta (RK2) method is used for the temporal advancement of the fluid flow (Yang et al., 2017, 2018; Cui et al., 2018; He et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022). At each substep of the RK2 method, the fractional-step method of Kim and Moin (1985) is applied to ensure that the flow field is divergence-free. In order to insert enough substeps to ensure that the flow can adapt to the change of particle motion during collisions and reduce the computational cost, the explicit Euler method is adopted in the particle-fluid interaction and particle-motion substeps for time advancement. The discretized equations are presented in Appendix B."

The pressure Poisson equation is only solved at the fluid flow time step t = tf , which greatly saves the computation cost. The computational time of the MTSA can be reduced to about one order of magnitude less than that of the traditional soft-sphere model with almost the same accuracy, which will be shown in \u00a74.\n(2) Compared with the SCTA, the MTSA employs physical particle stiffness without reducing particle stiffness. It is expected that the problem of hydrodynamic force underestimation will be alleviated or resolved by the MTSA, and the simulation of sediment transport will not be affected by nonphysically reduced particle stiffness. In addition, the parameters Ri in the MTSA has very good universality for different fluid time steps, which will also be shown in \u00a74.\nIn addition to the aforementioned algorithms proposed in particle-resolved simulations, some numerical algorithms have also been proposed in point particle simulations to address the mismatch of the time scales between particle collision and the fluid flow (Deen et al., 2007; Capecelatro and Desjardins, 2013; Finn et al., 2016). They generally employed two-time scales, where a large time step was adopted to advance fluid flow and the inter-phase coupling, while a small time step was employed for particle motion. Some researchers even used a smaller time scale to calculate particle collisions (Darmana et al., 2006; Marshall, 2009). However, as will be shown in \u00a74,\nthese algorithms are ineffective in particle-resolved simulations, since fluidparticle interaction is not resolved during a collision."

The simulation results of the restitution coefficient en were compared with a given en,d = 0.97 for steel and glass particles. For both Rm = 40 and 80, it is found that the relative error between en and en,d is less than 0.1%, which is sufficiently small. Therefore, the impact of Rm is not studied in this section.

These three cases can be regarded as using the MTSA without the fluid-particle interaction substep (i.e., Ni = Ri/Rf = 1), which is similar to the algorithm proposed for the point-particle simulations (Deen et al., 2007). Therefore, there are only two-time steps in cases REF, S1 and S2. Particularly, the Navier-Stokes and fluid-particle interaction equations are solved with the flow time step \u2206tf , while the Newton-Euler equations are advanced with the particle motion time step \u2206tp. Case REF is regarded as the benchmark case. In case S1, \u2206tf was smaller than that in case REF, which is used to verify the accuracy and convergence of case REF. In case S2, \u2206tf is larger than that in case REF, which is used to compare with the results of\nthe MTSA with the same \u2206tf to demonstrate the improvement by inserting additional fluid-particle interaction substeps.\nFirst, the bouncing motion of a single particle in a viscous fluid with different St and Dp/\u2206x values were simulated to assess the accuracy and convergence of the traditional soft-sphere model in particle-wall collisions. The physical parameters in the simulation were comparable to the experiment of Gondret et al. (2002): \u03c1p = 7800 kg/m\n3 and en,d = 0.97, and other parameters are listed in table 2. The computational domain was 12.8Dp\u00d725.6Dp\u00d712.8Dp. Two grid resolutions, Dp/\u2206x = 20 and Dp/\u2206x = 30, were implemented in this simulation. A periodic boundary condition was imposed in the horizontal directions, and a no-slip boundary condition was imposed on both the top and bottom surfaces. A particle was initially placed at x = Lx/2, y = Ly \u2212 0.75Dp, and z = Lz/2. The falling velocity was prescribed following Biegert et al. (2017), where it accelerated smoothly and uin matched the Stokes number in the previously reported experiment (Gondret et al., 2002) before the collision, as\nup(t) = uin ( e\u221240t \u2212 1 ) , if \u03b4n > Rp. (21)\nOnce the particle reached a distance of \u03b4n = Rp, we turned off the prescribed velocity. Then, the particle moved under hydrodynamic, gravitational, buoyant, and collision forces. The normal coefficient of restitution is defined as en = u \u2217 out/u \u2217 in. Following Costa et al. (2015), u \u2217 in and u \u2217 out are defined at the instants t \u2212 tc = \u2213f \u22121 s , where tc is the instant of collision and fs is the sampling frequency in measurements, which is 500 Hz in the experiment of particle-wall collision (Joseph et al., 2001) and 100 Hz in the experiment of particle-particle collision (Yang and Hunt, 2006)."

The simulation results of the coefficient of restitution en for normal particlewall collisions by the traditional soft-sphere model are shown in figure 2. The resulting en of case REF agrees well with the experimental results over the entire range of the particle Stokes number. This verifies the accuracy of the traditional soft-sphere model. The resulting en values are almost the same when refining the grid (i.e., Dp/\u2206x = 30) at St = 15, 27, 152, 742 or refining the flow time step \u2206tf (i.e., case S1) at St = 27, 152. This verifies the convergence of the traditional soft-sphere model. However, en is evidently underestimated with a much larger \u2206tf (case S2). This is because \u2206tf is too large to resolve the fluid-particle interaction so that the surrounding fluid cannot follow the rapid change of the particle velocity during the collision, and the velocity difference between the particle and fluid after the collision is increased. This leads to an overestimation of the hydrodynamic force by the IB method. The underestimated en in case S2 can cause a remarkable discrepancy in the particle bouncing trajectories, as shown in figure 3. It is seen that the trajectory of case S1 is almost the same as that of case REF, because the values of en are close in the two cases. The trajectory of the refined grid (i.e., Dp/\u2206x = 30) is not shown here, as the corresponding en and trajectory are very close to those of cases REF and S1.\nNext, a moving particle colliding with a steady particle in a viscous fluid with different St and Dp/\u2206x values was simulated to assess the accuracy and convergence of the traditional soft-sphere model in particle-particle collisions. The physical parameters in the simulations were comparable to the\nexperiments of Yang and Hunt (2006): Dp = 12.7 mm, \u03c1p = 7780 kg/m 3, \u03c1f = 1125 kg/m 3, \u00b5f = 45 cP and en,d = 0.97, and other parameters are listed in table 3.

The resulting en of case REF agrees well with the experimental and numerical results over the entire range of the Stokes number St. The resulting en is almost unchanged by refining the grid (Dp/\u2206x = 30) at St = 12, 34, 135, 345 or reducing the flow time step \u2206tf (case S1) at St = 34, which verifies the accuracy and convergence of the traditional soft-sphere model. Although the resulting en by increasing \u2206tf (case S2) is within the range of the widely scattered experimental results, there still was a visible deviation compared with the results of case REF due to the insufficient temporal resolution for fluid-particle interactions. Figure 4 (b) further shows the contact point trajectories of particles at St = 34. The trajectories in cases REF and S1 have good agreement with those of Costa et al. (2015). It is seen that the underestimated en of case S2 causes a visible discrepancy in the trajectories of the contact point compared with case REF.\nThe results of the particle-wall and particle-particle collisions indicate\nthat the traditional soft sphere model can be used to reproduce experimental results only if the flow time step \u2206tf is sufficiently small, and increasing \u2206tf would result in an underestimation of en and non-negligible errors in the particle trajectories.

Hence, the MTSA can be a good method to reduce the computational cost of the traditional soft-sphere model while maintaining its accuracy.

The left and right columns show the errors with grid resolutions of Dp/\u2206x = 20 and Dp/\u2206x = 30, respectively. The dashed line corresponds to zero error.\nIt can be seen that the general trends of the error curves with Ri in each subfigure are similar in figures 5 (a)-(f). As discussed before, en is underestimated (en,MTSA \u2212 en,REF < 0) without including additional fluidparticle interaction substeps, since the fluid flow surrounding the particle cannot adapt to the rapid change of the particle velocity. Therefore, the error curves are mostly under the zero-error line at small Ri values. If more fluidparticle interaction substeps are inserted (increasing Ri), the absolute value of en,MTSA\u2212en,REF decreases first. However, as the pressure Poisson equation is not solved in the particle-fluid interaction substeps, the intermediate flow velocities are nonphysical, which leads to an overestimation of en at larger Ri values. Therefore, the overall trend of the absolute error of en,MTSA\u2212 en,REF decreases first then increases with Ri, as shown in figures 5 (a)-(f).\nWe can elucidate the increase in the error of en,MTSA \u2212 en,REF with Ri as follows. Based on the Navier-Stokes equations discretized by the explicit Euler method, the intermediate flow velocities at the ith fluid-particle interaction substep during a collision can be expressed as\nui = ui\u22121 +\u2206ti ( H i\u22121 + f i\u22121 \u2212 1\n\u03c1f \u2207pi\u22121\n) , (22)\nu\u0303i = u\u0303i\u22121 +\u2206ti ( H\u0303 i\u22121 + f\u0303 i\u22121 ) , (23)\nwhere u and u\u0303 are the physical (by solving the pressure Poisson equation) and nonphysical (without solving the pressure Poisson equation) interme-\ndiate flow velocities, respectively; H and H\u0303 are the sums of the convective and viscous terms with physical and nonphysical intermediate flow velocities, respectively; f and f\u0303 are the volume forces with physical and nonphysical intermediate flow velocities, respectively.

During a collision, the particle motion is only determined by the collision model and not affected by the fluid flow (Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich, 2012a; Costa et al., 2015; Biegert et al., 2017), thus the particle velocities with physical and nonphysical intermediate flow velocities are the same (URip = U\u0303 Ri p ). Based on the IB method as in equation (B.3), the differences in the hydrodynamic force with physical and nonphysical intermediate flow velocities after a collision can be expressed as\n\u2206F Rip,l = F\u0303 Ri p,l \u2212 F Ri p,l\n= U\u0303Rip \u2212U Ri p +U Ri l \u2212 U\u0303 Ri l\n\u2206ti (28)\n= URil \u2212 U\u0303 Ri l\n\u2206ti .\nSubstituting equations (26) and (27) into equation (28) yields\n\u2206F Rip,l =\nRi\u2211\ni=1\n(\u2206H i\u22121l \u2212\u2206F i\u22121 p,l \u2212\n1\n\u03c1f \u2207P i\u22121l ). (29)\nEquation (29) includes three terms: \u2206H i\u22121l = H\u0303 i\u22121 l \u2212H i\u22121 l , \u2206F i\u22121 p,l = F\u0303 i\u22121 p,l \u2212 F i\u22121p,l , and \u2207P i\u22121 l , representing the flow velocity error, the hydrodynamic\nforce error, and the pressure error at each fluid-particle interaction substep, respectively. If \u2206H i\u22121l \u2212\u2206F i\u22121 p,l \u2212\u2207P i\u22121 l /\u03c1f 6= 0, the error of \u2206F Ri p,l increases as Ri increases, which leads to the error of en increasing with Ri. As shown in figures 5 (a-f) and figures 8 (a-f), en,MTSA increases with Ri, which indicates that the MTSA underestimates the hydrodynamic force as Ri increased and \u2206H i\u22121l \u2212\u2206F i\u22121 p,l \u2212\u2207P i\u22121 l /\u03c1f < 0.\nSince insufficient fluid-particle interaction substeps can cause an underestimation of en, and too many substeps can cause an overestimation of en. Therefore, we may find an optimal value of Ri to minimize the error of en. Figures 5 (g) and (h) show the contours of max |en,MTSA \u2212 en,REF | for different St and Dp/\u2206x values. It can be found that the maximum error is small for Ri \u2208 {4, 5, 6} with different St and Dp/\u2206x values, which indicates that the MTSA has good accuracy with Ri \u2208 {4, 5, 6} in the particle-wall collisions. Based on the maximum error in the particle-particle collisions shown in figures 8 (g) and (h), Ri = 4 is determined to be the optimal value. The maximum error for Ri = 4 is less than 0.031 in the particle-wall collisions, which is small enough.\nAfter determining that Ri = 4 is optimal, we employed the MTSA with Rf = 1, Ri = 4, Rm = 40 to calculate en for particle-wall collisions in the entire range of St. As shown in figure 6, the simulation results of the MTSA agree well with those of case REF and the experimental results over the entire range of St. Therefore, after inserting proper additional fluid-particle interaction substeps, the prediction results by the MTSA are significantly improved compared with those of case S2 in particle-wall collisions. The yellow error bars in figure 6 indicate the prediction uncertainty of en with Rf = 0.5, 1, 2. The short lengths of the error bars imply that the MTSA has good convergence with these Rf values. A consistent conclusion can be further drawn from the particle trajectories shown in figure 7. It can be seen that the particle trajectories predicted by the MTSA show good agreements with those of case REF, and they are significantly improved compared with those of case S2. The grey area is the particle trajectory range with Rf = 0.5, 1, 2. Such small areas demonstrate that the particle trajectories in the particle-wall collisions will not be much affected by \u2206tf if it is sufficiently small (Rf > 0.5)."

It is seen that the maximum error is small for Ri \u2208 {4} with different St andDp/\u2206x values, which indicates that the MTSA has good accuracy with Ri = 4 in particle-particle collisions. Based on the combined results of the particle-wall and particle-particle collisions, Ri = 4 is determined to be the optimal value and will be used in the following. The absolute maximum error for Ri = 4 is less than 0.024 in the particle-particle collisions, which is also small enough.\nWe further employed the MTSA with Rf = 1, Ri = 4, Rm = 40 to calculate en for particle-particle collisions over the entire range of St. As shown in figure 9 (a), the simulation results of the MTSA agree well with those of case REF and the experimental results. Its predictions are much better than those of case S2. The yellow error bars represent the prediction uncertainty of en with Rf = 0.5, 1, 2. The short lengths of the error bars demonstrate that the MTSA has good convergence with these Rf values. Figure 9 (b) shows the particle trajectories with St = 34. The particle trajectories predicted by the MTSA have excellent agreement with those of case REF and are much better than those of case S2. The grey area is the particle trajectory range with Rf = 0.5, 1, 2. The small grey areas indicate that the predicted particle trajectories in the particle-particle collisions are not much affected by \u2206tf if it is sufficiently small (Rf > 0.5).\nTo summarize, by considering the results of particle-wall and particleparticle collisions together, Ri = 4 is determined to be optimal for collisions with different St and Dp/\u2206x values. The prediction results by the MTSA with Ri = 4 have been shown to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements and the benchmark results (case REF) and made significant improvements over the results without inserting additional fluid-particle interaction substeps (case S2)."

            "text": "Now we applied the MTSA with Rf = 0.5, Ri = 4, Rm = 40 to simulate a turbulent flow over an erodible sediment bed. The turbulent flow was driven by a constant pressure gradient that is balanced by the shear stress on the sediment bed. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed in the streamwise and spanwise boundaries of the computational domain, no-slip boundary conditions were applied on the bottom surface of the domain and the particle surfaces, and free-slip boundary conditions were imposed on the top surface of the domain. The sediment bed was laid on the smooth bottom wall of the channel under gravity. The sediment bed consisted of Np = 7200 particles with four layers, as shown in Figure 11. In the present study, the sediment bed was generated by a sedimentation simulation for particles settling under gravity while turning off the hydrodynamic force, similar to Kidanemariam and Uhlmann (2014b).\nFor the parameters of the carrier phase, the size of the computational domain was Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 Lz = (6 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3)H with a uniform Cartesian grid of\nNx\u00d7Ny\u00d7Nz = 1200\u00d7200\u00d7600 grid numbers, where H is the computational domain height in the y direction. Here, x, y, and z denote the streamwise, wall-normal and spanwise directions, respectively. The friction Reynolds number is defined as Re\u03c4 = u\u03c4He/\u03bd = 94, where u\u03c4 = \u221a \u03c4b/\u03c1f is the friction velocity, \u03c4b is the mean shear stress at an effective sediment-bed height yb, and He = H \u2212 yb is the effective boundary-layer height. The bulk Reynolds number Reb = UbHe/\u03bd are 569, 582, and 614, for case MTSA, SCTA1, and\nSCTA2, respectively, where Ub = (1/H) \u222b H 0\n\u3008u\u3009 dy is the bulk velocity. The effective bed height yb was determined at the height where the mean particle porosity \u3008\u03c6p\u3009 = 0.1 (Kidanemariam and Uhlmann, 2014a), which yielded yb = 0.35H . The Shields number is \u0398 = u 2 \u03c4/((\u03c1p/\u03c1f\u22121)gDp) = 0.12, which is above the critical Shields number \u0398 c = 0.047 (Meyer-Peter and Mu\u0308ller, 1948; Wong and Parker, 2006), and the corresponding Galileo number is Ga =\u221a (\u03c1p/\u03c1f \u2212 1)gD3p/\u03bd = 42. The gravitational acceleration is g = 9.81 m/s 2.\nFor the parameters of the dispersed phase, the density ratio between the particle and the fluid is \u03c1p/\u03c1f = 2.65. The dimensionless particle diameter is Dp/H = 0.1. Referring to the recent particle-resolved sediment transport simulations (Jain et al., 2021; Kidanemariam et al., 2022), the grid resolution was chosen as Dp/\u2206x = 20, which is sufficient for sediment transport. The\ncorresponding Eulerian grid size is \u2206x+ = \u2206y+ = \u2206z+ = 0.47 < 1, which is able to fully resolve the turbulent channel flow. The superscript + indicates quantities normalized in viscous units (by u\u03c4 and \u03bdf ). The particle diameter in wall units was D+p = Dp/(\u03bdf/u\u03c4) = 14.5. The mean volume fraction of the dispersed phase was 21%.\nFor the parameters in the collision model, the normal restitution coefficient is en,d = 0.97, the tangential restitution coefficient is et,d = 0.39, and the friction coefficient is \u00b5c = 0.15; these were chosen according to the material properties of sand particles (Joseph and Hunt, 2004).\nThe simulations were carried out on the Tianhe-2A supercomputer with 50 nodes (1200 cores). Each node has two Intel Xeon E5-2692 cores and 64 GB of memory."

            "text": "Cases MTSA, SCTA1, and SCTA2 with different particle stiffness listed in table 5 were designed to investigate the effect of particle stiffness on the turbulence and particle statistics of the sediment transport simulation. For the MTSA, \u2206tf = Tc,min/Rf = 7.6 \u00d7 10\n\u22126 s was chosen to ensure that it can resolve mostly all collisions with different impact velocities, where Tc,min is the minimum physical collision time obtained by equation (17) with the maximum impact velocity uin,max = 8u\u03c4 based on a similar particle-resolved simulation by Vowinckel et al. (2014). The physical stiffness E = 55 GPa for the glass particle was applied in the MTSA, while the particle stiffness was reduced in cases SCTA1 and SCTA2 by stretching the collision time with the stretching coefficient N = 10 (Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich, 2012a). In case SCTA2, the particle stiffness was further reduced by increasing Tc compared with case SCTA1.\nIn our simulations, once the volume flux of the turbulent flow was statistically stationary, an averaging procedure described in Appendix C was\napplied to the flow and particle variables. In total, 250 snapshots of the flow field and 2500 snapshots of the particles during a time period of 15H/u\u03c4 were collected for time averaging. In order to distinguish whether the error came from reducing particle stiffness or statistical uncertainty, the time period 15H/u\u03c4 was equally divided into two periods of 7.5H/u\u03c4 . The results averaged over these two time periods were defined as the lower and upper boundaries (statistical uncertainty range) of the simulation, as shown by the shaded region in figures 12 to 14. The lines/symbols in the following figures are the results averaged over a total time period of 15H/u\u03c4 . In the following, the turbulence and particle statistics are compared between cases MTSA, SCTA1 and SCTA2. The wall-normal coordinate Y = y \u2212 yb is adopted and normalized by He.\nFigure 12 shows the profiles of the mean particle porosity (planar density) obtained in each x \u2212 z plane. The operator \u3008\u00b7\u3009 indicates an average over x \u2212 z plane (not a slab) and time. With this averaging operation, the theoretical maximum limit of particle porosity in dense packing is 0.906 (the largest planar density in the face-centered cubic structure), which is much larger than 0.74 of the largest particle volume fraction in three-dimensional space. Following Kidanemariam and Uhlmann (2014b), the mean particle porosity was calculated by equation (C.4) in Appendix C. The four peaks under the grey line indicate that the sediment bed consists of four layers of particles. The peak heights correspond to the mean center height of each layer of particles (Vowinckel et al., 2014). It should be noted that the particle porosity (Kidanemariam and Uhlmann, 2014b; Vowinckel et al., 2014), which is the particle fraction in the x \u2212 z plane rather than the volume fraction (Rao and Capecelatro, 2019), was employed since the particles are larger than the grid. If we chose a y-slab with a height ys larger than Dp, the mean volume fraction \u03a6 can be calculated through the in-\ntegration of the particle porosity as \u03a6 = (1/ys) \u222b y0+ys y0\n\u3008\u03c6p\u3009 dy, where y0 is the lower boundary of the y-slab. The mean volume fraction of the entire sediment bed is 0.58 with y0 = \u2212yb/He and ys = yb/He in the present simulation, which is lower than the theoretical maximum limit of dense packing of 0.74 (Rao and Capecelatro, 2019). The maximum particle porosity is 0.832, which is also lower than the theoretical maximum limit of 0.906 for dense packing. As shown in figure 12, the particle porosity above Y/He = 0.15 is approximately 0.01, which indicates that particles seldom jumped above Y/He = 0.15. Therefore, particle samples above Y/He = 0.15 within the\naveraging time window may not be sufficiently large to obtain convergent statistics. This problem can also be seen in figures 9 and 10 of Ji et al. (2014). Therefore, we only focus on the near-wall region (0 < Y/He < 0.15) in the following analysis.\nFor comparing the present simulation results with available experimental or numerical results, we cannot find any particle-resolved simulation studies or experimental measurements under similar conditions. In many experiments, both the size of particles and the Reynolds number of turbulent flow are much larger than the present one. In addition, as the particle volume fraction is usually very high near a sediment bed, it is very challenging to distinguish tracers and inertial particles in experiment (Brandt and Coletti, 2022). As a result, near-wall turbulence statistics are almost impossible to be extracted. We cannot find any experimental results of near-sediment-bed turbulence statistics in the literature also. A measurable quantity of sediment\ntransport rate can be compared, which is defined as q = (\u03c0D3p/6) (\u2211 Np \u3008up\u3009 ) / ( LxLyLz \u221a (\u03c1p/\u03c1f \u2212 1)gD3p ) in a non-dimensional form, where \u3008up\u3009 is mean particle velocity. The nondimensional sediment transport rates in cases MTSA, SCTA1, and SCTA2 are qMTSA = 0.0461, qSCTA1 = 0.0568, and qSCTA2 = 0.1396, respectively.\nThe well-known empirical formula of Wong and Parker (2006) gives q\u2217 = 4.93 (\u0398 \u2212 \u0398 c )1.6, where \u0398 c is the critical Shields number. Following Wong and Parker (2006), if \u0398 c = 0.047 is employed, we can get q\u2217 = 0.0748. It seems that the prediction by SCTA1 is the most accurate, but we argue that the formula of Wong and Parker (2006) was fitted with data at much larger flow-submerge (Y/Dp \u223c 40) and flow Reynolds numbers. The particle stability increases with decreasing flow depth under constant shear velocity, which is likely related to the suppression of the energetic large-scale turbulent motions due to the limited separation between flow depth and roughness length scales (smaller flow Reynolds number) (Cameron et al., 2020). Therefore, we believe that the actual sediment transport rate under the present simulation condition should be much smaller than q\u2217 = 0.0748.\nIn the near-wall region, the statistical uncertainties of the particle porosity are negligible compared with the errors caused by reducing particle stiffness. The present results show that when particle stiffness is reduced, the mean particle porosity is underestimated, and the underestimation increases as particle stiffness decreased, as displayed in figure 12. The relative difference between the results of case SCTA1 and case MTSA and between case SCTA2 and case MTSA are 24% and 40% at Y/He = 0.02, respectively. Thus, fewer particles are entrained in cases SCTA1 and SCTA2. This may be caused by excluding the hydrodynamic force during the collisions, which significantly ignores the effect of turbulence on particle entrainment with a time scale smaller than Tc. Vowinckel et al. (2016) found that 96.5% of the entrained particles were triggered by particle collisions. Therefore, the effects of turbulence may be substantially underestimated if Tc is greatly stretched, and fewer particles would be entrained in the near-wall region.\nFigure 13 (a) shows the streamwise mean flow velocity profile. In the nearwall region, the statistical uncertainties of the streamwise mean flow velocity are negligible. The results show that when particle stiffness is reduced by the SCTA, the streamwise mean flow velocity is overestimated compared with the MTSA, and the difference increases as particle stiffness decreases. The relative difference between the results of case SCTA1 and case MTSA and the results of case SCTA2 and case MTSA are 6% and 35% at Y/He = 0.02, respectively. This is probably because fewer particles are entrained from the bed in cases SCTA1 and SCTA2, which exert a smaller drag force on the flow. The profiles of the root-mean-squared (r.m.s) fluctuating flow velocities in the three directions are shown in figure 13 (b). In the near-wall region, it can be seen that the wall-normal and spanwise fluctuating flow velocities are close\nbetween cases SCTA1, SCTA2 and MTSA. For the streamwise fluctuating flow velocity, the statistical uncertainty is smaller than the uncertainty by the collision model. In fact, the r.m.s streamwise fluctuating flow velocity is underestimated by the SCTA compared with the MTSA, and the underestimation increases as particle stiffness decreases. This may be because particles are more difficult to be entrained in cases SCTA1 and SCTA2, which imposes fewer disturbances to the fluid in the near-wall region. Figure 13 (c) shows the profiles of the total shear stress (\u2212\u3008u\u2032v\u2032\u3009+ \u03bdfd\u3008u\u3009/dy) /u 2 \u03c4 , where u\n\u2032 and v\u2032 are the streamwise and wall-normal flow velocity fluctuations, respectively. The total shear stress nicely follows a linear profile in the outer flow indicating that the turbulent flow has been fully developed. The total shear stress is underestimated by the SCTA compared with the MTSA in the near-wall region, and the underestimation increases as particle stiffness decreases.\nFigure 14 (a) shows the profiles of the mean particle velocities. It is seen that the profiles of the wall-normal and spanwise mean particle velocities are quite close between cases SCTA1, SCTA2 and MTSA. In the near-wall region, the statistical uncertainties of the streamwise mean particle velocity are much smaller than those by reducing particle stiffness. This result definitely shows that when particle stiffness is artificially reduced, the streamwise mean particle velocity will be overestimated, and the difference increases as particle stiffness decreases. The relative difference of the streamwise mean particle velocity between cases SCTA1 and MTSA and between cases SCTA2 and MTSA can reach up to 87% and 325% at Y/He = 0.02, respectively. This may be because the mean flow velocity of cases SCTA1 and SCTA2 are higher than that of case MTSA, thus the drag force acting on the entrained particles increases to accelerate particles to higher speeds in cases SCTA1 and SCTA2. Figure 14 (b) displays the profiles of the mean particle angular velocities. It can be seen that the profiles of the streamwise and wall-normal mean particle angular velocities are close between cases SCTA1, SCTA2 and MTSA. In the near-wall region, the statistical uncertainties of the spanwise mean particle angular velocity are much smaller than those by reducing particle stiffness. The results in the near-wall region demonstrate that when particle stiffness is reduced by the SCTA, the spanwise mean particle angular velocity may be overestimated, and the difference increases as particle stiffness decreases. The relative difference of the spanwise mean particle angular velocity between cases SCTA1 and MTSA and between cases SCTA2 and MTSA can reach up to 62% and 150% at Y/He = 0.02, respectively. This may be because the mean flow velocity gradient is larger in cases SCTA1 and SCTA2.\nIt should be noted that a version of SCTA similar to Costa et al. (2015) is adopted here to be compared with the MTSA, which incorporates a twoparameter lubrication model, a linear spring-dashpot system, and substeps for particle collisions and motions. It is found that there are evident differences between the results of the sediment transport case using the SCTA and MTSA for the statistics especially particle statistics if the particle stiffness is greatly reduced. The differences increase as particle stiffness decreases (stretched collision time increases). Using different versions of SCTA with different model details like the lubrication model, linear vs. non-linear springdashpot, time integration among others may affect the results. However, we believe that the assumption of excluding the hydrodynamic force during particle collisions and the much longer collision time in the SCTA are the major reasons for the differences between the results using the SCTA and MTSA, as the other modeling and numerical aspects are the same in our code."

Furthermore, \u2206tf/\u2206tf,REF = 16 (i.e., Rf = 0.5) was used in the following simulations, and the computational time ratios of \u2206tf/\u2206tf,REF = 4 and 8 were also tested. As shown in figure 15, the computational time ratio of the MTSA is close to the ideal ratio \u2206tf,REF/\u2206tf . The computational efficiency can be increased by an order of magnitude using the MTSA with Rf = 0.5, Ri = 4, Rm = 40 compared with the traditional soft-sphere model.

            "text": "In the present study, a multiple-time-step integration algorithm (MTSA) has been proposed for particle-resolved simulations with physical collision time. The MTSA adopts three different time steps to resolve fluid flow, fluidparticle interaction and particle collision. We have successfully demonstrated the accuracy and convergence of the MTSA in particle-wall and particleparticle collision problems. It is shown that the MTSA can yield excellent\nagreement with experiments and benchmark simulations using the physical collision time and on a coarse grid (Dp/\u2206x = O(10)). It also overcomes the main drawback of a version of SCTA similar to Costa et al. (2015), in which an artificially stretched collision time is introduced, which may lead to the collision time being nonphysical and an underestimation of the hydrodynamic force and particle entrainment in sediment transport.\nThe impact of the parameters Rf , Ri, and Rm in the MTSA has been systematically analyzed and discussed. We found that Ri = 4 and Rm = 40 are universally suitable for particle-wall and particle-particle collisions over a wide range of particle Stokes numbers. The absolute error of en can be controlled to be within about 0.03 for different Rf values. After determining the optimal parameters of the MTSA, we applied the MTSA to simulate a turbulent flow over an erodible sediment bed. The statistics of turbulence and particles by the MTSA and a version of SCTA similar to Costa et al. (2015) were compared to investigate the effect of particle stiffness. The results demonstrated that if particle stiffness is artificially reduced by the SCTA, the number of entrained particles over the erodible sediment bed will be evidently underestimated compared with those by the MTSA, which will mainly impact the streamwise mean flow velocity, streamwise fluctuating flow velocity, streamwise mean particle velocity and spanwise mean particle angular velocity in the near-wall region. The prediction differences increase as particle stiffness decreases. Furthermore, the computation efficiencies between the MTSA and the traditional soft-sphere model were compared. The results indicated that the MTSA can substantially reduce the computational cost by up to one order of magnitude, and make the computational cost acceptable for particle-resolved simulations with physical collision time. As such, the proposed MTSA can be a valuable algorithm for generating high-fidelity and accurate data efficiently in particle-resolved simulations.\nFor future studies, we plan to perform more intensive particle-resolved simulations of sediment transport, including higher Reynolds numbers and particle/fluid density ratios. For example, the Reynolds number Re\u03c4 is an important non-dimensional parameter that may also affect the prediction difference between the simulations using the SCTA and MTSA, thus simulations at higher Re\u03c4 should be valuable. Simulating sediment transport using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique to reduce computational costs (Zeng et al., 2022a,b) is also within our future plans."

The discretized equations of fluid flow and particle motion in the kth Runge\u2013Kutta step are given as follows:\ndo k = 1, 2\nu\u0302k\u22121,0 = uk\u22121,\ndo i = 1, Ni\nu\u0302k\u22121,i = u\u0302k\u22121,i\u22121 +\u2206ti [ \u03b1kH\u0302 k\u22121,i\u22121 \u2212 \u03b2k ( H\u0302k\u22122,i\u22121 \u2212 1\n\u03c1 \u2207pk\u22122\n)] ,\n(B.1)\nu\u2217,0 = u\u0302k\u22121,i,\nF k\u22121,i,0 p,l = 0,\ndo s = 1, Ns\nU \u2217,s\u22121 l =\n\u2211\nijk\nu \u2217,s\u22121 ijk \u03b4d ( xijk \u2212X k\u22121,i\u22121,Nm l ) \u2206x\u2206y\u2206z, (B.2)\nF \u2217,s\u22121 p,l =\nUp\n( X\nk\u22121,i\u22121,Nm l ) \u2212U \u2217,s\u22121l\n\u2206ti , (B.3)\nf \u2217,s\u22121 ijk =\nNl\u2211\nl=1\nF \u2217,s\u22121 p,l \u03b4d ( xijk \u2212X k\u22121,i\u22121,Nm l ) \u2206Vl, (B.4)\nu\u2217,s = u\u2217,s\u22121 + (\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b2k)\u2206tif \u2217,s\u22121, (B.5) F k\u22121,i,s p,l = F k\u22121,i,s\u22121 p,l + (\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b2k)F \u2217,s\u22121 p,l , (B.6)\nenddo\nu\u0302k\u22121,i = u\u2217,Ns,\nuk\u22121,i,0p = u k\u22121,i\u22121,Nm p , xk\u22121,i,0p = x k\u22121,i\u22121,Nm p , \u03c9k\u22121,i,0p = \u03c9 k\u22121,i\u22121,Nm p ,\ndo p = 1, Nm\nuk\u22121,i,pp = u k\u22121,i,p\u22121 p + (\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b2k)\n{ \u2212\n\u2206tp Vp \u03c1f \u03c1p\nNl\u2211\nl=1\nF k\u22121,i,Ns p,l \u2206Vl+\n1\nVp \u03c1f \u03c1p\n  {\u222b\nVp\nudV }N \u2212 {\u222b\nVp\nudV }N\u22121 +\u2206tp ( 1\u2212\n\u03c1f \u03c1p\n) g+\n\u2206tp F\nk\u22121,i,p\u22121 p,lub\n\u03c1pVp +\u2206tp\nF k\u22121,i,p\u22121 p,col\n\u03c1pVp ,\n} (B.7)\nxk\u22121,i,pp = x k\u22121,i,p\u22121 p + (\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b2k)\u2206tpu k\u22121,i,p p , (B.8)\n\u03c9k\u22121,i,pp = \u03c9 k\u22121,i,p\u22121 p + (\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b2k) { \u2212\u2206tp\n\u03c1f Ip\nNl\u2211\nl=1\nrl \u00d7 F k\u22121,i,Ns p,l \u2206Vl+\n\u03c1f Ip\n  {\u222b\nVp\nr \u00d7 udV }N \u2212 {\u222b\nVp\nr \u00d7 udV }N\u22121 +\u2206tp T k\u22121,i,p\u22121 p,col\nIp\n} ,\n(B.9)\nenddo\nUp\n( X\nk\u22121,i,Nm l ) = uk\u22121,i,Nmp + \u03c9 k\u22121,i,Nm p \u00d7 (X k\u22121,i,Nm l \u2212 x k\u22121,i,Nm p ),\n(B.10)\nenddo \u22072pk\u22121 = \u03c1f\n\u03b1k\u2206tf \u2207 \u00b7 u\u0302k\u22121,Ni, (B.11)\nuk = u\u0302k\u22121,Ni \u2212 \u03b1k\u2206tf \u03c1f \u2207pk\u22121, (B.12)\nenddo\nwhere the superscripts N , k, i, p, and s are the indices of the flow time step, the Runge\u2013Kutta substep, the fluid\u2013particle interaction substep, the particle motion substep, and the IB method iteration substep, respectively. The coefficients in the RK2 scheme are \u03b11 = 1, \u03b21 = 0, and \u03b12 = \u03b22 = 0.5. Ns is the number of iterations to calculate the IB force in the multidirect forcing immersed boundary method(Luo et al., 2007; Breugem, 2012). The idea of this method is to iteratively determine the IB force to make the fluid velocity modified by the IB force better satisfy the no-slip boundary condition on the particle surface. Ns = 3 is employed following the suggestion of Breugem (2012). The subscripts ijk refer to the quantities on an Eulerian grid with indices (i, j, k), and the subscript l refers to the quantity on a Lagrangian point with index l. u\u0302 is the fluid velocity in f fluid-particle interaction substep, H\u0302 = \u2212\u2207\u00b7(u\u0302u\u0302)+\u03bdf\u2207\n2u\u0302 is the sum of the convection and viscous terms. u\u2217, f \u2217 and x are the intermediate fluid velocity, volume force, and coordinate on the Eulerian grid, respectively, and U \u2217, F \u2217, X are the corresponding quantities on the Lagrangian grid. The quantities between the Eulerian and Lagrangian grid points are transferred through a regularized Dirac delta function \u03b4d. Here, we use the three-point regularized Dirac delta function of Roma et al. (1999). The volume integrals\n\u222b Vp udV and \u222b Vp r \u00d7 udV are\nnumerically calculated according to Kempe and Fro\u0308hlich (2012b). \u2206Vl is the volume of the Lagrangian grid cell, and Up is the velocity on the particle surface."

            "text": "C.1. Averaging for flow variables\nBefore averaging the flow variables, an indicator function needs to be defined as \u03c6f(x, t) to distinguish an Eulerian grid point at a position x\nthat is inside or outside of a particle, following Kidanemariam and Uhlmann (2014b), which is\n\u03c6f(x, t) =\n{ 1, if x is outside a particle,\n0, otherwise. (C.1)\nBased on the indicator function \u03c6f(x, t), only the flow data outside of the particle are accounted for averaging as follows:\nnf (yj) =\nNt\u2211\nn=1\nNx\u2211\ni=1\nNz\u2211\nk=1\n\u03c6f(xijk, t n), (C.2)\nwhere nf(yj) is the total number of grids in the x\u2212z plane over Nt time steps for the flow statistics at a given height yj. Therefore, the ensemble average of the flow variables \u03bef(x, t) can be defined as\n\u3008\u03bef\u3009 (yj) = 1\nnf (yj)\nNt\u2211\nn=1\nNx\u2211\ni=1\nNz\u2211\nk=1\n\u03bef(xijk, t n)\u03c6f(xijk, t n), (C.3)\nwhere the operator \u3008\u00b7\u3009 indicates the average over an x \u2212 z plane and time. The particle porosity \u3008\u03c6p\u3009 (yj) can be deduced from \u03c6f(x, t):\n\u3008\u03c6p\u3009 (yj) = 1\nNtNxNz\nNt\u2211\nn=1\nNx\u2211\ni=1\nNz\u2211\nk=1\n(1\u2212 \u03c6f(xijk, t n)), (C.4)\nC.2. Averaging for particle variables\nParticle variables are averaged over all particles within each slab. A slab is generated by dividing H by a thickness of \u2206h. An indicator function \u03d5jp(yp, t) is defined to distinguish the center height yp of a particle inside or outside of a slab with index j as follows:\n\u03d5jp(yp, t) =\n{ 1, if (j \u2212 1)\u2206h 6 y < j\u2206h,\n0, otherwise. (C.5)\nBased on the indicator function \u03d5jp(yp, t), the particle number in each slab can be calculated as\nnjp = Nt\u2211\nn=1\nNp\u2211\nl=1\n\u03d5jp(y l p, t n), (C.6)\nwhere njp is the total particle number in the j slab over Nt time steps. Therefore, the averaged particle variable \u03bep can be defined as\n\u2329 \u03bep(y j) \u232a = 1\nnjp\nNt\u2211\nn=1\nNp\u2211\nl=1\n\u03d5jp(y l p, t n)\u03belp(t n). (C.7)\nA slab thickness of \u2206h = Dp/4 was selected in the present study."
