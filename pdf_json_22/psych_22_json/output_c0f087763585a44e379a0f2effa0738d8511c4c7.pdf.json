Within 1 year of antidepressant discontinuation, 35% of participants restarted treatment indicating depression relapse. As polypharmacy increased, the rate of restarting antidepressants increased until a maximum of 18 concurrent medications, where individuals were more than twice as likely to restart antidepressants (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% CI 1.32\u20133.51). As the duration of previous antidepressant treatment increased, the rate of restarting antidepressants increased \u2013 individuals with a previous duration of \u226525 months were more than twice as likely to restart antidepressants than those who previously discontinued in <7 months (HR = 2.36, 95% CI 2.25\u20132.48). We found no interaction between polypharmacy and previous antidepressant duration.",

Polypharmacy has been shown to be associated with increased depression symptoms,11 and therefore may place individuals at higher risk of depression relapse because of the burden of living with multiple long-term conditions and taking complex medication regimens,12 or the potential adverse effects of the medications themselves and interactions between them.13 Polypharmacy is common in individuals with T2DM, with the need to control blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol in most individuals, as well as the prevention and management of potentially numerous complications.14"

On the other hand, depression relapse is difficult to measure using routine data, where individuals may or may not present to healthcare services and outcomes of interest such as depression symptoms may not be recorded systematically. Therefore, using electronic health record (EHR) data from UK primary care, we aimed to investigate restarting antidepressant treatment, following discontinuation, as a marker of clinically identified depression relapse in adults with comorbid depression and T2DM. Specifically, we aimed to describe:\n(a) the proportion of individuals who restarted antidepressant treatment within the first year following discontinuation; (b) the association between the number of concurrent medications prescribed before discontinuation and subsequently restarting antidepressant treatment; (c) the association between the previous duration of antidepressant treatment and subsequently restarting antidepressant treatment; (d) the interaction between the number of concurrent medications prescribed and the duration of previous antidepressant treatment, with regards to restarting antidepressant treatment.\nWe hypothesised that higher levels of polypharmacy would be associated with higher rates of restarting antidepressant treatment because of its association with increased depression symptoms. We hypothesised that shorter antidepressant treatment durations would be associated with higher rates of restarting antidepressant treatment because of the evidence of higher rates of relapse in individuals who discontinued rather than maintained antidepressant treatment. Additionally, we hypothesised that longer durations of previous antidepressant treatment would attenuate the association between higher polypharmacy levels and higher rates of restarting antidepressant treatment."

(b) T2DM.

From this cohort, we included in our sample participants who discontinued antidepressant treatment between the years 2000 to 2018 and during their EHR follow-up. We defined antidepressant discontinuation as the absence of a recorded prescription for any other antidepressant within the first 60 days after expected duration of the last antidepressant prescription. We calculated the expected duration of the last antidepressant prescription using data on the number of tablets issued, recorded frequency and/or duration, length of previous prescriptions, or, where none of these were available, the median duration of 28 days. We specified a gap of 60 days to account for individuals who may collect their prescription at irregular intervals or who may restart antidepressant treatment within this period, because of withdrawal phenomena. Participants with <60 days follow-up after the expected duration of the final antidepressant before discontinuation were excluded."

B-splines are piece-wise defined and therefore ideal to model and interpret integer exposures as they overcome numerical instability.

Full participant characteristics are described in Table 1. The median number of medications prescribed simultaneously to the date of the last antidepressant prescription prior to discontinuation, excluding the antidepressant itself, was nine, with six of those identified as repeat prescriptions.\nThe majority of participants discontinued antidepressant treatment early with the median treatment duration of the first antidepressant prescribed at 2.79 months. Within the first year following discontinuation 35.39% of participants restarted antidepressant treatment.\nFull results for our main analyses our given in Table 2 and for our sensitivity analyses in the Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 available at https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2022.160.\nIn both the adjusted and unadjusted models, we found a dose\u2013 response relationship between the number of concurrent medications prescribed at the time of antidepressant discontinuation, and the rate of restarting antidepressant treatment (Fig. 2). The association began at two concurrent medications, with the rate of restarting antidepressant treatment following a linear increase for each additional medication prescribed, until 18 concurrent medications, at which point the maximum association was reached. The median number of nine concurrent medications was associated with a 64% increase in the rate of restarting (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.64, 95% CI 1.44\u20131.86). Our model did not fit a spline point before 1 concurrent medication or after 18 concurrent medications, indicating that there was no association between the number of concurrent medications and restarting antidepressants outside these points.\nAdjustment for confounders did not significantly change the effect sizes in any of our multivariable models.\nIn our sensitivity analysis, which redefined the primary exposure variable to include repeat prescriptions only, the association between number of concurrent medications and restarting antidepressant treatment began at five repeat prescriptions and increased until 10 repeat prescriptions. The median number of six concurrent medications was associated with a 52% increase in the rate of restarting (HR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.11\u20132.08).\nIn all both the adjusted and unadjusted models, we found a dose\u2013response relationship whereby the rate of restarting antidepressant treatment increased as the previous duration of antidepressant treatment increased.

Indeed, as the number of concurrent medications increased, the rate of restarting antidepressants also increased considerably, up to 115%. These results are in line with evidence showing that polypharmacy is associated with increased depressive symptoms,11 and so, as we had hypothesised, the increased rate of restarting antidepressant treatment is likely to represent an association with depression relapse.\n115 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2022.160 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nWe had also hypothesised that shorter durations of previous antidepressant treatment would be associated with an increased rate of restarting antidepressants and that longer treatment durations, having enabled the adequate treatment of depression previously, would attenuate the association between higher levels of polypharmacy and restarting antidepressants. However, conversely, the longer the previous antidepressant treatment duration, the higher the rate of restarting antidepressants. Although clinical trials in the general population have shown that participants are more likely to relapse from depression when they discontinue antidepressants compared with maintaining antidepressant treatment,8 the optimal treatment duration is unknown. A recent study investigating depression relapse following discontinuation of long-term antidepressant use (\u22652 years) still found high rates of depression relapse compared with the control group who maintained treatment.8 Longer durations of antidepressant treatment have also been found to be associated with depression relapse in meta-analysis.8 Indeed, we found no evidence to suggest that longer\nTable 2 Univariable and multivariable analysis for the association between primary and secondary exposures, and restarting antidepressant treatment Univariable HR (95% CI) Multivariable Model 1a HR (95% CI) Multivariable Model 2a HR (95% CI) Number of medicationsb 0 Reference point Reference point \u2013 2 1.01 (1.01\u20131.14) 1.08 (1.01\u20131.15) \u2013 3 1.15 (1.04\u20131.27) 1.16 (1.05\u20131.29) \u2013 4 1.22 (1.09\u20131.37) 1.24 (1.10\u20131.40) \u2013 5 1.29 (1.14\u20131.45) 1.33 (1.17\u20131.50) \u2013 6 1.34 (1.20\u20131.51) 1.40 (1.23\u20131.58) \u2013 7 1.39 (1.24\u20131.57) 1.46 (1.29\u20131.66) \u2013 8 1.45 (1.29\u20131.63) 1.54 (1.36\u20131.75) \u2013 9 1.52 (1.35\u20131.71) 1.64 (1.44\u20131.86) \u2013 10 1.60 (1.40\u20131.79) 1.72 (1.51\u20131.95) \u2013 11 1.63 (1.44\u20131.86) 1.78 (1.55\u20132.04) \u2013 12 1.68 (1.46\u20131.94) 1.83 (1.58\u20132.12) \u2013 13 1.74 (1.47\u20132.05) 1.87 (1.58\u20132.22) \u2013 14 1.79 (1.46\u20132.19) 1.92 (1.56\u20132.36) \u2013 15 1.85 (1.44\u20132.38) 1.97 (1.52\u20132.56) \u2013 16 1.90 (1.39\u20132.62) 2.03 (1.47\u20132.81) \u2013 17 1.97 (1.33\u20132.93) 2.09 (1.40\u20133.12) \u2013 18 2.04 (1.26\u20133.31) 2.15 (1.32\u20133.51) \u2013 Duration of previous antidepressant <7 months Reference category \u2013 Reference category 7\u20139 months 1.56 (1.48\u20131.66) \u2013 1.60 (1.51\u20131.70) 10\u201313 months 1.73 (1.62\u20131.84) \u2013 1.79 (1.68\u20131.92) 14\u201324 months 2.02 (1.93\u20132.12) \u2013 2.13 (2.03\u20132.23) \u226525 months 2.14 (2.04\u20132.24) \u2013 2.36 (2.25\u20132.48)\na.

However, the previous duration of antidepressant treatment could be a proxy for depression severity, with those participants with longer previous durations of treatment being more severely depressed and therefore more likely to subsequently relapse. This fits with our suggested explanation for the association between polypharmacy and restarting antidepressants, namely that the association may be caused by more severe depression in individuals with higher levels of polypharmacy. On the other hand, participants with shorter durations of previous antidepressant treatment may not have tolerated the antidepressant, and so may be less keen to restart similar treatments. Another potential explanation may be the misidentification of restarting antidepressant treatment. Individuals with longer previous durations of antidepressant treatment may have accumulated a back supply of medication. This could allow them to have a longer gap between prescriptions without discontinuing. This would mean that these individuals had not restarted treatment, but simply the continuation of the original course of treatment."

            "text": "With a sample size of 48 001, this study is over 100 times larger than the largest RCT investigating antidepressant relapse following discontinuation in any population.8 This has enabled us to more precisely model the relationship between restarting antidepressant treatment and a complex exposure, such as polypharmacy, using spline functions. The use of spline functions, as opposed to linearbased modelling, has enabled us to identify the minimum and maximum values for which the association with our outcomes was present (by fitting spline points within this range) and to identify the true size of the association compared with a baseline value of zero. This approach only reports associations that it identifies, therefore, there is no HR available for one concurrent medication or after 18 concurrent medications. In addition, the use of penalised-fit spline functions, as opposed to categorising the number of medications into clinically relevant groups (e.g. 1\u20134, 5\u201310), has allowed us to show that the rate of restarting antidepressants increases for each additional concurrent medication \u2013 a clinically relevant finding that would have been obscured by using broader categorisations.\nOur outcome of restarting antidepressant treatment was intended as a potential marker of depression relapse. Almost all prescribing in UK primary care is electronic, and the vast majority of prescriptions are entered accurately on a patient\u2019s EHR. Thus, we have high confidence in the completeness and accuracy of restarting antidepressant treatment as our outcome variable. On the contrary, depression diagnoses, episodes or symptoms are known to be significantly under recoded,24 and therefore, would not be suitable to identify depression relapse. Restarting antidepressant treatment does not represent systematic assessment for depression as an outcome. Individuals experiencing depression relapse may or may not present to healthcare services, or still may choose not to restart antidepressants. However, restarting antidepressant treatment represents clinically identified depression, whereby the clinician and patient have identified a need to restart treatment. Further research would be beneficial to identify individuals experiencing relapse who do not restart antidepressant treatment.\nIt is also important to note that we were unable to directly account for previous depression severity, which may be associated with polypharmacy and longer previous durations of antidepressant treatment, and may increase the subsequent risk of relapse.\nAs we only included individuals who started antidepressant treatment with one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in\nthe UK, we may have missed a subgroup of individuals with diabetic neuropathic pain, who may have been prescribed antidepressants such as duloxetine to treat both depression and pain together.\nFurthermore, our study only included participants with depression whereas antidepressants may also be prescribed to treat anxiety.25 Further research is needed investigating antidepressant outcomes in individuals with comorbid anxiety and T2DM.\nRCTs are the gold standard for evaluating medication outcomes and often have strict inclusion criteria thereby enabling case definition and outcome definition certainty. However, the strict inclusion criteria also often excludes complex populations, such as the participants in this study with comorbidities and concurrent polypharmacy.5 In addition, their use of predefined interventions and end-points prevent them from investigating real-world medications use, where the decision to discontinue or restart treatment is based to a large extent on patient/clinician preferences and behaviours. Our use of routinely collected EHR data enabled us to investigate real-world prescribing patterns, populations and prescribing outcomes."

This may reflect an association with depression relapse. Further research is required to understand whether the association is with polypharmacy itself, confounding by indication of depression severity or multimorbidity. Further research is also required to understand whether there are key medications or conditions that drive the association. Enhanced support and monitoring when discontinuing antidepressants may be of benefit for individuals with T2DM and high levels of polypharmacy, particularly those who have been on antidepressants for longer durations, as these individuals may be at higher risk of relapse. Additionally, further research is required to establish optimum antidepressant treatment durations, including whether this differs across specific patient groups such as people with T2DM.\nAnnie Jeffery , Epidemiology and Applied Clinical Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London (UCL), UK; Cini Bhanu, Department of Primary Care & Population Health, Institute of Epidemiology & Health, University College London (UCL), London, UK; Kate Walters, Department of Primary Care & Population Health, Institute of Epidemiology & Health, University College London (UCL), London, UK; Ian C.
