The stratified analysis revealed that rs690\nwas associated with an increased risk of stroke in subjects aged \u2264 64 years, male\npatients, and smokers, and rs6074 was associated with an increased risk of stroke\nin subjects aged > 64 years, male patients, drinkers, and non-smokers (p < 0.05).\nThe results of the MDR analysis suggested the four-locus model as the most\nfavorable model for assessing the risk of stroke. The analysis of clinical parameters\nof stroke patients showed that rs690was correlatedwith platelet distributionwidth\n(PDW) (p = 0.014) and hematocrit levels (p = 0.004), and rs6074 was correlated\nwith low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level (p = 0.033). Furthermore,\nbioinformatics analysis results demonstrated that the expression levels of LIPC\nand its related genes (APOB, CETP, PNPLA2, and LMF1) were significantly di erent\nbetween the control and stroke groups (p < 0.05), and LIPC-related proteins were\nmainly related to lipid metabolism.\nConclusion: This study indicated that rs690 and rs6074 in LIPC were significantly\nassociated with increased risk of stroke in the Chinese population, possibly by\nregulating the levels of PDW, HCT, and LDL-C.\nKEYWORDS\nLIPC, polymorphisms, stoke, susceptibility, Chinese population, case-control study\nFrontiers inNeurology 01 frontiersin.org\nPan et al. 10.3389/fneur.2023.1095282"

            "text": "Stroke is manifested by neurological deficits caused by impaired blood circulation in the brain. It is mainly described as a brain disease with symptoms such as sudden faintness, hemiplegia, numbness of the limbs, and tilted mouth and tongue. Although medical treatment has made great progress in recent years, the incidence of stroke is still increasing due to factors such as population aging and changes in people\u2019s living habits, making it the world\u2019s second-leading cause of death and the main cause of disability (1). Notably, China is facing the largest burden of stroke (2) in recent years, with the incidence and prevalence of stroke still increasing, especially in rural areas (3). Deaths from stroke in China account for almost one-third of the total stroke deaths in the world (4). Therefore, research studies on stroke are particularly necessary.\nA large number of studies have indicated that genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of stroke (5). Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and obesity are also studied to be risk factors for stroke (6). Lipase C (LIPC) is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 in band 21.3 and is mainly responsible for encoding lipase C. The dual function of the LIPC gene, namely, triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor, is mainly used for receptormediated lipoprotein uptake. Common variants in LIPC have been shown to be associated with plasma lipid levels (7, 8). A previous study has demonstrated an association between the polymorphism (-514C > T) in LIPC and type 2 diabetes risk, which is modified by the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level (9). LIPC variant rs2070895 has been found to be associated with carotid atherosclerosis (10) and hypertension (11). Moreover, LIPC variants (rs2043085 and rs1532085) have been observed to be significantly associated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), lipid accumulation product, visceral adiposity index, and triglyceride glucose (TyG) index-related parameters (12). However, there are very few studies on the correlation between LIPC polymorphisms and the risk of stroke.\nTherefore, this study was undertaken to detect the association between LIPC polymorphisms and the risk of stroke from 710 patients with stroke and 701 healthy controls in the Chinese population. The results of this study will provide a certain scientific theoretical basis for early screening, prevention, and diagnosis of stroke in the Chinese population."

All SNPs had a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05 in the Chinese Han Beijing (CHB) population from the 1000 Genomes Project (http://www.internationalgenome. org/). The functions of candidate SNPs were predicted using the NCBI dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) and HaploReg v4.1 databases (https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mamma ls/haploreg/haploreg.php) (16). The results showed that the four SNPs in LIPC were both synonymous and coding sequence variants. Peripheral venous blood (5mL) from each subject was collected for DNA extraction according to the instructions of the whole blood genomic DNA extraction kit (GoldMag Co. Ltd. Xi\u2019an, China) (17). The DNA concentration and purity were determined by spectrometry (NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific, USA). In this study, the Agena Bioscience Assay Design Suite was performed (3.1) to design primers (polymerase chain reaction primers and unique base extension primer) for the four SNPs in LIPC. These primers were synthesized by Bioengineering (Shanghai Co., Ltd). The Agena MassARRAY platform (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to genotype the four SNPs. Ultimately, the Agena Typer Software (version 4.0, Agena Bioscience, USA) was used for data analysis and processing (18)."

Acc = 0.519; OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.32\u20132.07, p = 0.0001, Table 6)."

Furthermore, the Sangerbox analysis results showed that the biological processes of the main protein\u2013protein interactions related to LIPC mainly involved the metabolism of cholesterol and glycerolipid pathways (Figure 5)."

            "text": "This is the first study to analyze the relationship between LIPC polymorphisms and the risk of stroke in the Chinese population. In the overall analysis, we found that rs690 was associated with an increased risk of stroke in the Chinese population.\nFrontiers inNeurology 09 frontiersin.org\nPan et al. 10.3389/fneur.2023.1095282\nThe stratified analysis revealed that rs690 was associated with an increased risk of stroke in subjects aged >64 years, male subjects, and smokers. In addition, s6074 was associated with an increased risk of stroke in subjects aged \u2264 64 years, male subjects, non-smokers, and drinkers. In addition, we found that rs690 was associated with PDW and HCT levels, and rs6074 is related to the LDL-C level. MDR analysis results demonstrated that the four-locus model was the best model for stroke risk assessment.\nLIPC encodes the hepatic lipase. A whole-exome sequencing study has revealed that the abnormal combination of the AA genotype of rs17269397 in LIPC and cholesterol levels can affect the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (22). A study using the meta-analysis approach has shown that rs2070895 in LIPC was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (11). Previous studies have demonstrated that LIPC plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In addition, it has been elucidated that LIPC exhibits a gene-level association with myocardial infarction (23). This study was the first to reveal that LIPC polymorphisms were associated with the risk of stroke in the Chinese population.\nIt has been reported that age, gender, alcohol consumption, and smoking are important risk factors for stroke (24). More precisely, the main driver for increased stroke prevalence is the aging of the population (25, 26). The incidence of stroke is higher in male patients, and also male patients have their first stroke earlier than female patients. However, female patients have more severe strokes than male patients (27, 28). Alcohol consumption has complex effects on cardiovascular health, and views on the\nassociations between alcohol consumption and stroke risk remain controversial (29, 30). Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for all forms of stroke. Continued smoking after a stroke is associated with a high risk of stroke recurrence and other cardiovascular diseases (31). Our research has shown that rs690 and rs6074 in LIPC were associated with an increased risk of stroke in male patients. These two loci were also associated with an increased risk of stroke in different age subgroups (\u2264 64 years and < 64 years, respectively). Furthermore, the T allele of rs690 was associated with an increased risk of stroke in smokers. The allele A of rs6074 was associated with an increased risk of stroke in non-smokers and alcohol drinkers. Hence, we speculated that the impacts of age, gender, smoking, and drinking on the susceptibility to stroke were stronger than the combination of rs690 and rs6074.\nStudies have shown that the combination of rs690 in LIPC and other SNPs in LIPC can affect the bioavailability of dietary cholesterol in healthy adult male patients (32) and is associated with the HDL-C level (7). Our research also showed that rs690 was associated with the PDW and HCT levels of stroke patients instead of HDL-C. PDW was an important risk factor for stroke in atrial fibrillation patients (33). Several large-scale observational studies have pointed out an increased risk of stroke in individuals with elevated HCT (34). Therefore, we speculated that rs690 in LIPC modified the risk of stroke by modulating PDW and/or HCT levels. Among South Indian subjects without diabetes, the CA genotype of rs6074 has been found to be associated with a low level of HDL-C (35), suggesting that rs6074 is related to the LDL-C level rather than HDL-C. Previous study has found that a very low LDL-C level is associated with high risks\nFrontiers inNeurology 10 frontiersin.org\nPan et al. 10.3389/fneur.2023.1095282\nof all-cause and stroke mortality (36), thus, the AA genotype of rs6074 was associated with an increased risk of stroke by regulating the LDL-C level. LIPC polymorphism rs6083 has been found to be associated with cholesterol, triglyceride, LDLC (14), and HDL-C levels (7). However, little is known about the association between rs6083 and the clinical parameters of stroke patients.\nAs genetic polymorphisms worked jointly on disease risk, MDR analysis was conducted in this study to further explore the impact of SNP\u2013SNP interactions on the risk of stroke, indicating that SNP\u2013SNP interactions demonstrate an antagonistic effect on the risk of stroke, and the combination of the four sites is the best risk assessment model for stroke. A study has exhibited an association between abnormal lipid metabolism and stroke (37). Our bioinformatics analysis results indicated that the expression levels of LIPC and its related genes (APOB, CETP, PNPLA2, and LMF1) showed significant differences between stroke and control groups. The main LIPC-related protein\u2013protein interactions were connected with lipid metabolism, which is expected to provide a new direction for investigating the effect of LIPC on stroke risk.\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, this study is the first to explore the relationship between LIPC polymorphisms and stroke susceptibility in the Chinese population. To further verify the results, a large sample will be collected in the following studies. Second, the subjects in this study came from the same hospital during the same period, and the geographic limitations in sample selection should not be overlooked. Third, we only predicted the signal pathway that LIPC might participate in through the databases, and the impact of SNPs on the LIPC gene mRNA level and the function of LIPC in stroke have not been explored in this study."
