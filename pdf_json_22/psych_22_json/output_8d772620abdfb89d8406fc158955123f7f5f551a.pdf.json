Primarily, the related concepts and theories are expounded for the research content. Children in preschool aged 4\u20135 years are invited as primary participants in this work, and the psychological characteristics of the invited children are analyzed in depth. Then, a study is carried out on the existing AR children\u2019s picture books. The problems existing in the design of AR children\u2019s picture books are found, and then, related solutions are put forward based on the results of the questionnaire survey. Besides, a design is made on the strategies and interactive design principles of AR children\u2019s picture books on mobile terminals that are more in line with the needs of children. The results show that 41.07% of parents do not understand AR technology, and 37.5% of preschool children indicate that they do not operate mobile devices independently. However, they need the assistance of parents to use this kind of picture book. A total of 44.64% of parents believe that the main problem of AR picture books in the current market is the lack of interesting interaction. Given the above problems, five principles are proposed for the design of AR children\u2019s picture books based on mobile terminals, namely, easy operation principle, interesting principle, guiding principle, timely feedback principle, and safety principle. A set of universally applicable design methods are proposed for AR children\u2019s picture books based on mobile terminals, which provides certain theoretical guidance for the development of related types of products.",

Children are in a critical period of physical and psychological development. Picture books have gradually developed into an essential tool, playing an important role in children\u2019s cognition development (Patterson, 2019; Fears and Lockman, 2020). During the reading process, picture books can help\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nchildren to establish the correct three outlooks. As a type of literary carrier, picture books have brought a new era of text expression and image portrayal, which helps to enhance children\u2019s interest in reading. The picture book is a special educational way for children, which can satisfy children\u2019s imagination and desire for exploration and play a significant role in children\u2019s growth (Takacs and Bus, 2018; Yamaji et al., 2020). Precisely, picture books have become the primary choice for parents and schools to cultivate and educate their children because of these characteristics. In China, translations imported from other countries account for the majority of the market of picture books for children. In contrast, the market share of Chinese picture books for children is limited. According to the development law of children\u2019s mental cognition, picture books should actively absorb high-quality resources worldwide and develop, following the actual situations.\nRegarding the relationship between picture books for children and child psychology development, Sundmark (2018) described the development trajectory of early concept books as picture books for children. Based on the analysis of language and visual dimensions, the results revealed the importance of picture books in the cognitive development of children and adolescents (Sundmark, 2018). Candel et al. (2020) reckoned that picture books provided non-linguistic subjects, including art, numbers, and music, from where children could study knowledge, culture, and communication, and improve their ability of cognition. Scholars recommended using Cuadernia software to compile picture books and emphasized their importance in broadening students\u2019 knowledge and enhancing students\u2019 learning vitality and interest (Candel et al., 2020). To help children obtain beneficial information from emotional cognition and emotional preference, Wang (2017) used different artistic styles, emotional themes, and color elements to design picture books and explore children\u2019s emotional states and emotional expressions. Aldrich and Brooks (2017) chose a picture book about frogs to study the relationship between children\u2019s narrative evaluation and performance. At present, experts and scholars have researched the relationship between picture books and the cognitive development of children. Whether in China or other developing countries, products of children\u2019s picture books with augmented reality (AR) are not very mature, basically in the stage of development and exploration. The product design is still relatively immature. There are many products put into the market, but due to the lack of targeted research literature, there is no corresponding reference in the research process, especially in the application design of AR children\u2019s picture books in the mobile terminal. Related researches focus on the realization and improvement of AR technology and do not focus on the content of products. There is a lack of further research on how to use AR technology to provide more benefits to children\u2019s picture books (Billinghurst et al., 2001).\nBased on this, the research and design are mainly focused on the AR children\u2019s picture book in mobile APP. Preschool children aged 4\u20135 years are invited as the participants of the research. Entertainment elements are added in AR children\u2019s picture books concurrently with these picture books providing education and learning for children\u2019s users, to promote children\u2019s\nintellectual development, improve children\u2019s aesthetic level, and make children and their parents get different reading experiences."

            "text": "From the perspective of academic attention and academic communication, taking 2015 as the dividing line, this work divides the domestic research on deep learning into two stages: from about 2004 to 2015, deep learning entered the vision of educational researchers in China, which is the dormant period of deep learning; since 2015, deep learning has developed rapidly in China. Overall, the domestic research on deep learning has not yet formed systematic. Since 2004, deep learning has not caused a boom like other nouns in China. On the contrary, it is in a dormant state. Only a few researchers have introduced it at the theoretical level. It may be that the theory of deep learning itself remains to be improved, followed by deep learning. It is almost a reversal of traditional teaching, and the goal level is far from the general goal of school education and teaching. Finally, the conditions to promote and support deep learning are not mature or even lacking, such as the creation of real learning situations, and complex abstract content is difficult to visualize. With the application of emerging technologies in education and teaching gradually opening up, deep learning has entered a period of rapid development after a long dormant period. Since the beginning of 2015, both the number of papers published by deep learning and the degree of academic communication and attention have continued to rise. Specifically, from 2015 to the first half of 2016, deep learning has entered a peak period of development and has maintained a small growth since then. Researches are concentrated in the universities of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University and Tsinghua University, covering automation technology, computer software and computer applications, secondary education, and primary and higher education; the scope involved includes artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural network. This section will focus on the research status of deep learning in education and teaching.\nThe researches on deep learning in developed countries dominated by the United States mainly focus on two major issues, namely, how to promote the occurrence of deep learning and how to evaluate deep learning, including the evaluation methods of deep learning effect and the evaluation methods of promoting the occurrence of deep learning. Litjens et al. (2017) reviewed the main concepts of deep learning related to image analysis, summarized more than 300 contributions to this field, investigated the application of deep learning in image classification, object detection, segmentation, registration, and other tasks, and provided a brief overview of research in each application field. Chen et al. (2017) introduced the concept of deep learning into hyperspectral data classification. The applicability of a stacked automatic encoder is verified according to the classical classification method based on spectral information, and a classification method based on spatial dominance information is proposed. Then, a new deep learning\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nframework is proposed to fuse these two features, to obtain the highest classification accuracy. Oshea and Hoydis (2017) proposed and discussed several new applications of physical layer deep learning. By interpreting the communication system as an automatic encoder, a basic new method is developed to treat the communication system design as an end-to-end reconstruction task, aiming to jointly optimize the transmitter and receiver components in a single process."

            "text": "As the origin of picture books, Europe and the United States have gradually matured after hundreds of years of growth and formed a relatively complete cultural industry. The increase in the incentive systems such as the International Andersen Awards and the Caddick Awards has made the institutional system of picture books more and more perfect, which to some extent represents the high level of the picture book market. As early as 1,744, Mr. Newbury\u2019s Beautiful Book was published. It was the first book specially designed for children in the world, creating a precedent for foreign picture books and gaining the title of \u201cfather of children literature.\u201d Foreign studies on the content of picture books are relatively more in-depth, such as Perry Norman\u2019s Saying Pictures: Narrative Art of Children\u2019s Picture Books mainly explored the important relationship between pictures and texts, using pedagogy, psychology, aesthetics, and other arguments to clarify the overall significance of children\u2019s picture books.\nJennifer (2019) proposed an art project to strengthen the scientific content of ecology in children\u2019s picture books. Ten students from different socioeconomic classes and different cultural and linguistic backgrounds from the United States and Spain participated in the event. Next-generation scientific standards have been identified and resolved in these art projects. Students\u2019 understanding and participation are assessed through teacher\u2019s observation, photographs, and student attitude surveys. Strouse and Ganea (2021) pointed out that story picture books with examples can be used to teach children the scientific concepts. Learners can abstract relational information by comparing examples in the book, to have a more abstract and transferable understanding of the concept. Breit-Smith et al. (2017) discussed that the effect of interactive book reading intervention is characterized by illustrated picture books. The group intervention was conducted by four practitioners three times a week for 8 weeks, targeting six preschool children identified as having language disorders. Interventions include the use of language facilitation strategies in interactive book reading and postreading extension activities to promote children\u2019s understanding of sequential text structures, academic vocabulary, and plant-related scientific subject knowledge."

            "text": "(1) Concepts and Features of the Deep Learning\nThe new era puts forward higher requirements for talent cultivation. Countries around the world are constantly\nexploring how to cultivate talents that can adapt to the needs of future social development. Based on this background, the term of core literacy required for future life comes into being, and the proposal of deep learning is an active response to talent cultivation in the new era. Deep learning is proposed based on the widespread phenomenon of learners\u2019 non-participation, one-way transmission of knowledge, learners\u2019 passive mechanical acceptance, and the adverse consequences of shallow learning. Based on the investigation of the current situation of children\u2019s picture book teaching, it is not difficult to find that the current children\u2019s picture book lacks scientific activities of application, and children are still in a passive and mechanical learning state. It is far from the training objectives of the curriculum. Therefore, deep learning has become a learning method that matches the training objectives of children\u2019s teaching courses. Meanwhile, it has become one of the effective ways to change the participation status of learners and shallow learning. Deep learning is a concept proposed by American scholars in the second half of the 20th century. Its initial purpose is to explore the degree of learners\u2019 learning engagement and mastery of knowledge. In the learning process, different learners will adopt different strategies to achieve the purpose of mastering knowledge. Learning methods can be simply divided into deep learning and shallow learning. Deep learning refers to learners\u2019 thinking, understanding, and raising their questions in the learning process; shallow learners do not pay attention to the understanding of knowledge, only through passive memory to obtain knowledge. Deep learning is superior to shallow learning. Further deep learning and shallow learning are compared, as shown in Figure 1. In the process of continuous development, the concept of deep learning is also defined by educational researchers at home and abroad from different perspectives, as shown in Figure 2. Through the interpretation of the concept of deep learning from the above different perspectives, it is found that to promote the occurrence of deep learning, school teaching must fully understand its connotation and characteristics, design corresponding learning activities, and guide learners to conduct deep learning. This paper elaborates on the characteristics of deep learning from the perspective of learners. Learners are the main participants in learning activities and the actual executor of learning tasks, especially in deep learning. The prevalence of shallow learning is closely related to learners\u2019 passive, negative learning attitude, selfrule orientation, and vague learning objectives. Depth has the following characteristics: learners try to understand the learning content in-depth and have critical learning of the knowledge content presented by teachers; actively seek the connection between old and new knowledge, build a new cognitive structure; explore the reasons and laws behind the conclusion, logical reflection, whereas shallow learning is manifested as passive mechanical\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nFIGURE 1 | Comparison of deep learning and shallow learning.\nFIGURE 2 | Different definitions of deep learning.\nacceptance of knowledge information; not actively seeking the internal relationship between the old and new knowledge points; simple acceptance of the conclusions, lack of inquiry process, biased toward the conceptual facts of the mechanical memory; learning aims at coping with exams. Learners\u2019 active participation is the key to deep learning, which is reflected in the comprehensive input of perception, thinking, emotion, will, and values; promoting the comprehensive development of specific people is the basic way to cultivate learners\u2019 core literacy. (2) Augmented Reality Technology Augmented reality technology is not a new concept, belongs to the field of virtual reality research, and is an important direction of human\u2013machine interface\ninteraction technology development. In the early 1990s, Tom Caudell and his colleagues first proposed the term \u201cAR\u201d in the design of auxiliary wiring systems. They superimposed the wiring path drawn by simple lines and text prompt information in real time, to help the mechanic complete the whole disassembly process quickly and efficiently. Subsequently, AR applications have emerged in medical, military, entertainment, manufacturing, and maintenance fields. There are two widely accepted definitions of AR. The \u201creality-virtual continuum\u201d was initially proposed by Milgram and Kishino. This definition classifies the environment presented by the combination of virtual objects and real scenes. It is considered that the real scene and the virtual environment are located at both ends.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nThe part near the real environment is AR, and the part near the virtual environment is augmented virtuality (AV). The middle part is mixed reality (MR), as shown in Figure 3.\nThe second definition was proposed by Ronald Azuma of the University of Bekaa in Azuma, arguing that AR technology has three basic characteristics, namely virtual\u2013real combination, three-dimensional registration, and real-time interaction. The first definition shows that AR technology is more inclined to the real world, and the virtual object is constructed in the computer and superimposed into the real scene by graphic image technology. The three-dimensional registration feature is reflected in AR that the position information of the camera is tracked in real time to determine the accurate position of the virtual object in the real scene and realize the complete fusion of the virtual and real scene. The real-time interactive feature is that users can get feedback information in time. In summary, AR technology is the extension and development of virtual reality technology. This technology provides users with a virtual and real combination environment by simulating objects, which can see the generated virtual objects. More importantly, users can manipulate and control virtual model objects, such as rotation. AR intention realizes the superposition of computer-generated objects and real situations, that is, the effect of combining virtual and real. Using a variety of devices, such as eyes with imaging primitives, overlaying virtual objects into real scenes allows users to see virtual objects and real scenes at the same time and achieve interaction with virtual objects. AR research involves a wide range, including computer graphics and image processing, human\u2013machine interface interaction, and psychology. Although it does not need to display the complete scene, it needs to analyze much positioning data and scene information, to ensure that the generated virtual objects can be accurately located in the real scene. Therefore, an AR system includes four basic steps: first, to obtain the relevant information of the real scene; second, the real scene and camera position information are comprehensively analyzed and then generate virtual scene; finally, it is displayed directly or combined with the real scene video. The complete AR system components include camera unit, storage unit, processor unit, display unit, and human\u2013computer interaction interface unit, as shown in Figure 4.\nThe camera unit is used to shoot the real scene; the memory unit is divided into local storage and cloud storage; as the core unit of the whole system, the processor determines whether the whole system can operate efficiently. The display unit mainly presents virtual and real mixed scenes for users; the human\u2013computer interaction connection supports real-time interaction between users and the whole system. In summary, AR system is constantly improving and optimizing with the rapid development of science and technology. In this study, the combination of virtual and real features and human\u2013computer interaction features of AR technology is applied to children\u2019s picture books to provide learners with rich and intuitive learning resources, promote learners\u201d deep understanding of knowledge, and create realistic learning situations and scientific experiments to explore the environment, to promote the occurrence of learners\u201d deep learning."

            "text": "The brain function of preschool children aged 4\u20135 years is not fully developed and immature, which lacks logical analysis ability. However, they are rich in imagination and good at fantasy and challenge, who have active creative thinking. Having strong imagination is the most important psychological characteristics of children at this stage, which comes from children\u2019s feedback on environmental stimuli. But due to cognitive limitations, the image thinking ability of children is weak in this period, and their perception of the world is relatively simple. Thinking is mainly divided into abstract thinking and concrete thinking. Concrete thinking ability has been existing in a person from his or her childhood, and abstract logical thinking ability is formed in a person\u2019s school age. Besides, at this stage, children obtain certain understanding abilities, but the ability is still relatively elementary. They can generate feedback from the external environment through the observation of the surrounding environment and things. They have preliminary reading comprehension ability and this period is the best period for them to receive an education. Hence, 4- to 5-year-old preschool children can grow through reading picture books, which are helpful to their learning habits and also thinking and cognitive ability (Okumu et al., 2017; Weissman et al., 2020).\nChildren\u2019s psychological characteristics include four aspects as shown in Figure 5.\n(1) Thinking Characteristics Generally speaking, children begin to focus on concrete thinking when they are at the age of 4 years, whereas abstract logical thinking will only show up slowly after they get to 5 years old. The formation of abstract thinking is mainly manifested in the fact that children begin to have a specific concept of an object, have a correct judgment of right and wrong, and gradually form reasoning thinking. Mastering the simple classification of objects and the simple causal relationship has greatly improved the understanding ability of children compared with that of the before. The design and development of AR children\u2019s picture books need to be paid attention to the cultivation of children\u2019s abstract thinking (Meinawati et al., 2021). (2) Memory Characteristics There are two characteristics in the memory development of preschool children aged 4\u20135. First, unconscious memory is dominant, whereas conscious memory appears and develops continuously. The memory of these children is short, things are remembered quickly and forgotten quickly for them, and children\u2019s memory is easy to be interfered with by external factors. Second, children\u2019s memory is mainly based on image memory, and the logical memory of words of them is in the developing stage. In this stage of age, children\u2019s memory lacks purpose, and they can only remember the things that they are interested in. When observing things, they can only remember the specific image of the object. At this stage, letting children read in a relaxed and happy environment can improve children\u2019s\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nFIGURE 3 | The relationship between AR, MR, and AV.\nFIGURE 4 | Systematic structure of AR technology.\nFIGURE 5 | Children\u2019s psychological characteristics.\nmemory ability and achieve the effect of moistening things silently (Norbury et al., 2017; Zahra et al., 2021). (3) Attention Characteristics The research shows that 4- to 5-year-old preschool children passively pay attention, and they are more interested in objects with bright colors and vivid appearance. Additionally, there are only 10 to 20 min of stable attention duration for their memory. Children\u2019s attention is easily disturbed by the outside world. Therefore, parents are generally worried about children\u2019s inattention. How to effectively attract children\u2019s attention and enhance children\u2019s interest in reading is an important problem to\nbe solved in the design and development of AR children\u2019s picture books (Farooqui, 2018). (4) Emotional Characteristics The mood of preschool children aged 4\u20135 years fluctuates quite frequently. Generally speaking, they have the following emotional characteristics: First, they often stimulate the outside world, and their mood fluctuates greatly, unlike adults, who can control their emotions. Second, children like to express their emotions with body language, which is easy to be expressed in explicit behavior. Third, children\u2019s emotions are highly contagious (Mana et al., 2013).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nWith the analysis of the emotional characteristics of preschool children aged 4\u20135 years, their psychological characteristics can be summarized as follows: they are self-centered and have strong curiosity; their thinking can diverge quickly, their brains are active, and the development of their perception needs multisensory stimulation. Their behavior is easily affected by emotion, and their self-control ability is weak. They hope to be praised and affirmed. They are lively and actively considering the games as the main form of their activity. The design and development of AR children\u2019s picture books based on the mobile terminal will further focus on children\u2019s cognitive characteristics."

            "text": "(1) Digital Content Enhances the Narrative Function of\nPicture Books Traditional paper-based children\u2019s picture books are mainly based on picture content, supplemented by a small number of words, which provide children with a linear and passive reading experience. In essence, AR children\u2019s picture books refer to a new display and auxiliary method, and its characteristic of the combination of reality and realtime interaction makes picture books more suitable for AR display. Compared with traditional paper picture books, the advantage of AR children\u2019s picture books lies in the fact that through technical treatment, the story content of picture books is presented more intuitively while retaining the book fragrance of paper picture books, which is the integration of technology and art. With the support of AR technology, the linear story content in picture books can be presented in a three-dimensional and intuitive non-linear form. Self-participation in story construction is more conducive to children readers\u2019 understanding of the contents of picture books. Digital contents such as 3D animation, video, and audio enhance the narrative function of picture books. After scanning picture books using smart devices, the static picture will become a multimedia display with sound and video as a whole, and the story seems to appear in the real environment. The characters and scenes in the picture book are integrated with the real space where the children readers are located so that children can have an immersive experience. This brings a strong sense of immersion and substitution to reading, which also meets children\u2019s creative imagination needs (Altintug and Debreli, 2017; Huang and Jiang, 2019). (2) Human\u2013Computer Interaction Enriches the Sensory Experience of Picture Books Traditional paper children\u2019s picture books need children to read page by page. AR children\u2019s picture books change the single reading to multiple interactions, and their human\u2013computer interaction brings a game-oriented and emotional interactive form. Children interact with the role of picture books through interactive behaviors such as touching and finger clicking, thus becoming the subject of interaction. Using visual and auditory senses to perceive the contents of picture books, a brand-new reading experience that is different from the traditional\nreading mode of picture books can be obtained for the children readers. The real-world experience creates a virtual and real interactive sensory experience, which enriches children\u2019s reading experience. The virtual reality scene and multisensory experience satisfy children\u2019s sense of participation. Interaction of traditional paper books with AR changes the way of reading and story presentation (Quitadamo et al., 2017; Chakraborty et al., 2018). In the AR environment where real objects and virtual images coexist, information is put into the system, and then, the system responds to users with its presentation, which constructs close coordination between things in the physical world and images in the virtual world, thus embedding the children pictures\u2019 books with AR characteristic. There are many methods to pass the feeling directly to the users. In addition, the most important basic principle is to integrate \u201cuser experience in real environment\u201d with the AR environment. With technology\u2019s growing mature, there are various methods of realizing the interaction and diverse hardcore configuration to construct a system with an AR environment. So far, there are four main methods to realize interaction. Touch screen interaction \u2013 nowadays, capacitive screen is becoming very popular in mobile devices, which also provides the basis for AR interactive technology, and touch screen interaction has become the mainstream form of such devices. At present, the mature ways include double-click feedback, light touch, and multitouch. Multitouch technology can complete the interaction between the system and many contact points at the same time. Users can put both hands into operation and even can meet the needs of multiusers. Eye-tracking interaction \u2013 there are two major methods to realize eye-tracking interaction technology. One is to capture the user\u2019s eye focus position. The other is to measure the trajectory of the eye with the head as a reference. Therefore, the core of eye movement is the configuration of user attention, focusing on specific content. This technology can collect and record the eye movement during the user\u2019s using process and then sort out the user\u2019s attention retention time and observe points facing different contents. This technology provides users with a picture of the integration of AR and the real world, which is more immersive. However, due to the complexity of this technology, it is not large-scale commercialized. Hand gesture recognition interaction \u2013 gesture recognition interaction controls the device by sensing the user\u2019s gestures, which is highly acceptable to users. At present, two kinds of methods have been developed to realize hand gesture recognition. One of the methods is using special gloves to complete movement tracking and collection, but this also increases the complexity and costs of the technology; second, special algorithms are used to collect the user\u2019s hand movements. The algorithms can identify the direction or action of fingertips and palms for interaction. Speech recognition interaction \u2013 the device receives the user\u2019s speech in the form of the voice signal and processes it as the corresponding command or text output, which is\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\na kind of speech recognition interactive technology. Three major characteristics need to be paid attention to: first is model training technology, second is the model matching criterion, and third is feature extraction technology. (3) Multimedia Integration Improves the Information Transmission Efficiency of Picture Books Traditional paper picture books mainly focus on static illustrations in content, with relatively simple forms of expression, and some too abstract contents are not conducive to children\u2019s understanding. With the integration of AR technology, the picture book becomes a three-dimensional animation work combining sound and picture, the content and information of paper picture book increases, and the addition of multimedia makes the characters in the story three-dimensional. The presentation of the scene also has a sense of substitution. Multimedia integration has strengthened the expressive ability of picture book stories, effectively improved the transmission efficiency of picture book information, and made it easy for children readers to understand. This multimedia integrated reading form can make picture book reading that appears in various ways, give children various sensory stimuli, and stimulate children\u2019s multidimensional perception. It can cultivate children\u2019s imagination, perception, and creativity and contribute to children\u2019s thinking ability in images (Oshi, 2018)."

Figure 6 implies that more preschool children prefer picture book reading, and only a few do not like picture book reading. Parents are also willing to participate in parent\u2013child reading, but the times may vary due to working hours, so the market prospect of picture books is good. (2) Figure 7 denotes the survey results of parents\u2019 cognition of AR technology. Figure 7 signifies that some parents only have a general understanding of AR technology and have not been exposed to it so much, and even fewer parents have purchased AR picture books for their children. It shows that the market share of AR children\u2019s picture books is not high, and other factors affect parents\u2019 purchases. (3) Figure 8 reveals children\u2019s proficiency in using mobile devices independently. Figure 8 illustrates that the number of people who know most of the operations is almost the same as those who cannot operate, which shows that in the design and development process of AR children\u2019s picture book, both AR interactive content interaction and APP interaction need to pay attention to the operation ability of children users on mobile devices, which cannot be generalized.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\n(4) Figure 9 shows the factors that parents buy AR children\u2019s picture books and the research results that parents think AR children\u2019s picture books can bring to their children. Figure 9 presents that many factors restrict parents from purchasing AR children\u2019s picture books, such as lack of interesting interaction, lack of parent\u2013 child interaction, and rough production of virtual content. Besides, parents also believe that AR children\u2019s picture books can bring benefits to children\u2019s reading. However, there are still concerns about the influence of eyesight and addiction to playing mobile phones, which needs to be highly valued by design developers.\n(5) Figure 10 displays what functions that parents expect AR children\u2019s picture book products to have and what aspects of design and development should be paid attention to. Figure 10 reveals that parents generally expect AR children\u2019s picture book products to have the function of developing children\u2019s thinking ability and making children fond of the learning. Besides, aesthetic training functions are also the design priorities, whereas the expectation for the game function is generally low. Additionally, parent\u2013 child interaction is a design aspect that parents attach great importance to. These are the factors that need to be considered in the design and development of AR children\u2019s picture books.\nAccording to the questionnaire survey, results clearly show that parents and children have great demand for picture books. Most parents have a positive attitude toward AR children\u2019s picture books based on mobile terminals and think that excellent AR children\u2019s picture books can entertain children and bring novel experiences to children. It is the parents who make the final purchasing decision. At present, many factors restrict parents from purchasing AR children\u2019s picture books. Hence, the products should make parents to buy and use with peace of mind based on making children interested. Nowadays, most parents are busy at work, who spend relatively limited time with their children, so they pay great attention to the parent\u2013child interaction of AR children\u2019s picture books. It is hoped that the product design will pay more attention to the development of children\u2019s thinking, aesthetic function, and the cultivation of their learning ability."

User research is an indispensable part of any product design process, so it is the design and development of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nmobile AR children\u2019s picture books. From the initial design concept of the product to the functional architecture, to the completion and production, user research should be carried out through the entire development process. Because designers and developers are not children users, whose lifestyles and way of thinking are far from adult users. Hence, it is difficult to resonate with target users without in-depth research. According to Piaget\u2019s theory of children\u2019s cognitive development, children\u2019s cognitive development stages can be divided into four parts according to their variety of ages. Children in different stages have great differences, and their psychological and physiological cognition are similar and different. If user research is not made properly and thoroughly, products likely designed will make children feel uncomfortable or difficult to attract their attention and stimulate their interest in reading and using. According to the cognitive\ndevelopment of children users, the corresponding design is particularly important. To better distinguish the needs of children users and provide them with high-quality picture books and age-appropriate APP products, it is necessary to master children\u2019s reading psychology and their habits in operating APP in the early stages of product design development and customize differentiated products (Jeffri and Rambli, 2017; Yang and Wang, 2017; Waters et al., 2019). (2) Content creation of AR children\u2019s picture books should be strengthened. The production of AR children\u2019s picture books based on mobile terminals can not only use AR technology to show off skills but also ignore the creation of picture book content. It is necessary to combine high-quality picture book content with AR technology. Paper picture book is the carrier of AR virtual content presentation and\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nsuperposition, and the interaction of virtual content needs to be realized by a paper picture book. Fun AR interactive forms need to be set off by the integration of pictures, text, and virtual content in paper books. In the creation of AR children\u2019s picture books, attracting children\u2019s interest is the starting point, and the content must be the core, and the educational function of picture books should be highlighted in content. The organic combination of the readability of picture book content and the interest in pictures is the key to improve the quality of original picture books. The design of picture book content should reserve space for the deduction of virtual content. In the early creation of picture books, we can consider in advance what plots can interact through AR (Sabrina, 2017). (3) The interactive entertainment of virtual content should be promoted. Through the recognition function of the camera embedded with mobile equipment, AR virtual content can be presented on the screen of the mobile device. Various forms of virtual content can improve children\u2019s interest in learning, including different presentation dimensions, different presentation styles, and rich dynamic images such as video and audio. AR virtual content design focuses on the need to ensure that the paper picture book story content plot integrity under the premise of appropriate design and add for the virtual content interactive plot, to ensure its interest and perfect. Virtual content presented\nby AR is essentially an extension of paper picture book content. In the design and development of AR interactive function, the first thing to be considered is the correlation between virtual content and picture book content, and it is necessary to ensure that the AR display form and interactive effect are consistent with the paper picture book content. The second is how to use AR technology and multimedia forms to strengthen the visual effect of picture books to improve the interactivity and entertainment of paper picture books. Technology serves content. The presentation of virtual content should be reasonable and meet the personalized needs of children\u2019s reading groups. The effective combination of static picture book content and AR interactive effect can attract the reading interest of children readers (Li and Zheng, 2020). (4) Building multisensory interactive experience. In the stage of children exploring the world and enlightening thinking, sensory experience is the most basic and direct way for children to feel the world. AR children\u2019s picture book products can improve children\u2019s reading experience by guiding children\u2019s visual, auditory, and other senses. Through this reading form, children users can not only intuitively feel the story content of picture books, but also stimulate children\u2019s interest in exploration and thirst for knowledge, and truly cultivate children\u2019s creative thinking. Therefore, the design of AR children\u2019s picture books focuses on the presentation of multisensory\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\ninteractive expression. On the one hand, it is necessary to properly connect and transition paper content and virtual content; on the other hand, it emphasizes the design of artistic expression, interactive design, three-dimensional production, sound feedback, and so on, to realize the multisensory experience function of picture books and create a perfect reading experience. For preschool children, they need to use icon symbols that are easy to understand visually. In color matching, they can consider the use of colors with high purity and brightness. In the hearing, they can add sound interactive prompts and feedback and integrate them into real and natural sounds. In a tactile sense, they can try to complete the design of paper picture books with different materials, to stimulate children\u2019s multiple sensory experiences. In recent years, as parents pay increasingly more attention to the education model, the educational concept of edutainment is becoming gradually more popular. While paying attention to children\u2019s physical and mental development, designers need to reposition the interaction in the AR environments according to their psychological and behavioral characteristics for children of different ages. How to create effective and interesting interaction and create a multisensory interactive experience will be the focus of AR children\u2019s picture book design (Lubrica et al., 2017). (5) The performance to realize the interaction between parents and children should be improved. In parent\u2013child reading communication, parents are the key to determine the reading effect. Therefore, the difference in reading behavior is determined by parents\u2019 attitude to AR children\u2019s picture books. Through the questionnaire survey on parents, it is found that parents generally hope to be able to add a parent\u2013child interaction module in AR picture book application, through the use of APP can meet the needs of parent\u2013child reading. Although some AR children\u2019s picture books enhance children\u2019s reading experience by simulating their parents\u2019 voices, this kind of bypass effect cannot completely replace their parents\u2019 reading status. Because in the traditional parent\u2013child reading communication mode, parents will timely and appropriately expand stories in the picture books, comparing the story with life experience and the truth to cultivate children\u2019s habits. Some interactive functions in AR children\u2019s picture book application are less helpful to children\u2019s oral expression ability. Therefore, when designing the virtual content of picture books, it is necessary to enrich the parent\u2013child interaction form of application and increase some parent\u2013child communication functions. If the real sound acquisition function is added, the picture book story is assigned by the child user or the parent user. The system scores the performance of the child and the parents according to the collected audio content, and the collected audio can be saved for children and parents to listen to repeatedly. Furthermore, the multiplayer game can be added into the design, where children and parents can play different roles\nin picture books, thus making interesting interaction in the form of role-play according to the picture book (Ginn et al., 2017; Kildare and Middlemiss, 2017).\nThe interactive design principles of AR children\u2019s picture books based on mobile terminals mainly include five points, which will be analyzed in detail.\n(1) Easy to operate the principle Children have limited knowledge of the world, and the simpler things they operate in their thoughts, the easier it is to get their love. Children\u2019s picture books should stand in the angle that children like and change the operation mode of the APP interface into the minimalist mode that the children like. Because of limited cognition, children usually do not like things that are too complicated or particularly rational. When adding interface functions and visual elements, it should be fully considered whether these meet the needs of children users, eliminate irrelevant functions and elements, and reduce the thinking burden of children users. Adding complicated functions for the sake of visual effects will distract children\u2019s attention and affect the user experience. Consideration should be made from three aspects: icon design, gesture operation, and layer and architecture how to design AR children\u2019s picture book APP to meet children\u2019s needs interactively and how to operate it simply. (2) Interest principle Children\u2019s self-restraint ability is weak, and children aged 4\u20135 can concentrate for only about 5\u201320 min. The older they are, the longer they can concentrate. The survey shows that most AR children\u2019s picture book products, except paper picture books, are rarely used many times after being used once. Therefore, improving the interest in interface interaction and AR interaction is one of the keys to keep children users, which can make children pay more attention and prolong the use time of products. For preschool children aged 4\u20135, the interestingness of interface interaction can be reflected in some small details, such as interesting dynamic effects when clicking function icons and jumping to pages. The role-playing mode can be added to AR interaction, and role-playing is a kind of game-like interaction mode. Children can choose their favorite virtual characters in picture books, and in the virtual scene constructed according to the contents of picture books, they can participate in game checkpoints to promote the development of storylines, to complete the reading task. (3) Guiding principle For AR children\u2019s picture book products, to enable children users to quickly use the matching APP and help them quickly enter the product experience, it is necessary to guide children who use the APP for the first time on the functional interface. Effective guidance can keep children users and increase their interest in using the APP. On the one hand, children\u2019s attention time is short, and the success of guidance directly determines children\u2019s interest in using\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 782958\nthe APP. On the other hand, designers should also pay attention to guiding methods and learn to use simple methods to improve children\u2019s interests. Children\u2019s ability to recognize characters is limited, so it is required not to do too much character guidance when guiding, and proper integration of some animation or music effects can improve the guiding efficiency. (4) Timely feedback Feedback refers to an appropriate response of the APP interface to the user\u2019s operation steps when the user performs human\u2013computer interaction. The interface of APP needs to provide feedback for every operation step, which is a very important part of the user experience. The purpose of feedback is to let users know that their actions have produced results. Timely feedback can inform the children whether the operation is correct and guide them to the next step, to improve the fluency of using APP while avoiding excessive feedback. (5) Safety principle Preschool children\u2019s self-control and judgment ability are weak. Long-term use of electronic products will lead to children\u2019s users indulging in them, and there are potential safety hazards and addiction risks, which will affect their eyesight and physical and mental health. The safety of electronic products is particularly important. When designing an AR children\u2019s picture book APP, designers should fully consider product safety. Inappropriate circumstances such as pornography and violence should not appear in the content. It is also necessary to control the time when children use products and set up the function of parents\u2019 intervention. After the children use the product for more than the set time, the screen will be locked, and there will be prompts such as the need to rest and relax their eyes."

            "text": "With the development of AR technology and its maturity in the use of mobile devices, combining AR technology with paper picture books, characters, scenes, and other contents in picture books can be presented in three-dimensional form and on the screen of mobile devices, and readers can interact with virtual contents in a real environment. The application of AR technology keeps the advantages of traditional picture books, but\nhas the advantage of the reading process changing from static to dynamic, and making reading more interesting. However, due to the technical limitations and cost problems, the combination of AR technology and children\u2019s picture books is mostly tested in the market at present, and few products are well received. Focusing on children is the key to the design and development of AR children\u2019s picture books. AR children\u2019s picture books make the picture book content, virtual content, APP visual design, and interactive design of AR children\u2019s picture book based on mobile terminal meet the needs of target children users, and at the same time, it is more interesting, instead of just using technology as a marketing gimmick, which is worthy of in-depth exploration in the field of book publishing, design, and development. Primarily, the related concepts and theories are expounded for the research contents. The preschool children aged 4\u20135 are selected for exploration, and the psychological characteristics of the target children users are analyzed in depth. Then, the existing cases of AR children\u2019s picture books are studied, and the existing problems in the design of AR children\u2019s picture books are put forward based on the questionnaire survey results. According to the needs of children users, the design strategy and interaction design principle of AR children\u2019s picture book on the mobile terminal are constructed, which is more in line with children\u2019s audience positioning."
