Exploration of the Mechanism of Action for Crossoseamines and Coumarin Glucosides: Given the significant cytotoxic activities demonstrated by the novel compounds isolated from Crossostephium chinense against a variety of pathogens and cancer cell lines, a valuable future research direction could involve elucidating the precise mechanisms of action of these compounds. This could include studying their interactions with specific molecular targets within the pathogens or cancer cells, their effect on cell cycle progression, apoptosis induction, and how they overcome resistance mechanisms in pathogens and cancer cells.

Biosynthetic Pathway Characterization: The paper suggests a Michael-type reaction for the biosynthesis of crossoseamines A and B, indicating the involvement of specific enzymes. Future research could focus on identifying and characterizing these enzymes, which could lead to a deeper understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of sesquiterpene-amino acid conjugates in plants. This might also offer insights into how plants produce bioactive compounds and open pathways for bioengineering these compounds for medicinal purposes.

Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Studies of Isolated Compounds: Conducting comprehensive SAR studies on the novel compounds, particularly crossoseamines and the newly identified coumarin glucoside, could provide insights into how structural variations influence their biological activity. Such studies can help in the design and synthesis of analogues with enhanced potency, specificity, and reduced toxicity, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic agents.

Screening of Other Asteraceae Plants for Novel Bioactive Compounds: The successful isolation of novel compounds from C. chinense underscores the potential of the Asteraceae family as a source of new bioactive molecules. Future research could involve screening other less-studied plants within this family to discover new compounds with anticancer, antiparasitic, or other therapeutic potentials. This could contribute to the diversification of natural product sources for drug discovery.

Development of Drug Formulations and Delivery Systems: With the identification of compounds showing significant cytotoxic activities, a logical next step would be the development of drug formulations and delivery systems that maximize the therapeutic potential of these compounds. This could include nanoparticle-based delivery systems, conjugates for targeted delivery, or formulations that improve solubility and bioavailability. Additionally, investigating the compounds' stability, metabolism, and pharmacokinetics in vivo would be crucial for their development into clinically useful drugs.
