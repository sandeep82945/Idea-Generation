Namely, those polynomials occur intrinsically in the study of the Zeeman effect on Hy-\ndrogen atom. It is shown that in the variables (r, \u03c1, \u03d5) in the quasi-exactly-solvable generalized Coulomb problem new polynomial eigenfunctions in (r, \u03c12)-variables are found.\n\u2217 turbiner@nucleares.unam.mx \u2020 admau@xanum.uam.mx\nThe Hydrogen atom is one of the most fundamental systems in quantum physics and in Nature. Of course, it is present in practically all textbooks on quantum mechanics, see e.g. [1]. Usually, exploring O(3) geometrical symmetry, it is studied in spherical coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03d5), see Fig.1, although parabolic coordinates (r + z, r \u2212 z, \u03d5) are also used in different applications. The states are characterized by the well-known Coulomb quantum numbers (nr, \u2113,m) and the Laguerre polynomials Lnr(r) naturally occur in the eigenfunctions. In this Letter the coordinates (r , \u03c1 , \u03d5) are used for which the eigenfunctions are characterized by new orthogonal polynomials in two variables (r, \u03c12).\nLet us take the two body Coulomb system or, equivalently, the Hydrogen-like system (Ze,\u2212e) in three-dimensional space. After center-of-mass separation we arrive at the threedimensional space of relative motion which will be parametrized by variables (r , \u03c1 , \u03d5), see Fig.1 for geometrical setting, here r = \u221a x2 + y2 + z2 is radius, \u03c12 = x2 + y2, tan\u03d5 = y/x, when expressed in the Cartesian coordinates of the space of relative motion.\nThe Hamiltonian in the relative space is of the form\nH = 1 2\u00b5 p\u03022 \u2212 \u03b1 r , (1)\nhere \u03b1 = Ze2 > 0 for the case of attractive charges, p\u0302 = \u2212i~\u2207 is the momentum operator and we assume for simplicity a unit reduced mass, \u00b5 = 1 from now on and setting ~ = 1.\nInstead of solving the Schro\u0308dinger equation\nH\u03a8 = E\u03a8 ,\nwe introduce the operator\nr (H \u2212 E) = ( \u2212r 2 \u2206\u2212 Er ) \u2212 \u03b1 \u2261 (H \u2212 \u03b1) , (2)\nand look for its zero modes, here \u2206 is the Laplacian. This is equivalent to the study of the spectrum of the operator H ,\nH \u03a8 = \u03b1\u03a8 , (3)\nwhere \u03b1 - the Coulomb parameter - plays a role the spectral parameter, while the energy E - the original spectral parameter - is considered fixed. This procedure resembles the introduction of the known Sturm representation in quantum mechanics.\nRecently, in studying the Hydrogen atom in a constant uniform magnetic field it was shown a convenience of use the coordinates (r, \u03c1, \u03d5) for the parametrization of the SO(2)\u2295 Z2(z \u2192 \u2212z)-sub-symmetry of the system (1), see [2]. Such coordinates imply a partial separation of variables - the variable \u03d5 can be separated out - and a representation of the wavefunctions of the Hydrogen atom as follows,\n\u03a8 = \u03c1|m| e\u2212\u03b2r zp eim\u03d5 P (r, \u03c1;m, p) \u2261 \u0393P (r, \u03c1;m, p) , (4)\nwhere m is the magnetic quantum number, z2 = r2 \u2212 \u03c12, p = 0, 1 defines parity, and \u03b2 = \u221a \u22122E. Here, the first two factors emerge from the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions at small and large distances, respectively, whilst the factor eim\u03d5 is the eigenfunction of the z-component of the angular momentum Lz = \u2212i\u2202\u03d5, which is conserved. Eventually, the problem of finding the eigenfunctions \u03a8 is reduced to finding the eigenfunctions P (r, \u03c1).\nLet us take\n\u0393 = \u03c1|m| e\u2212\u03b2 r zp eim\u03d5 , (5)\nas the gauge factor and introduce the gauge rotated operator\nh \u2261 \u0393\u22121H \u0393 . (6)\nAfter some calculations we arrive at\nh = \u2212 1 2 r \u22022r \u2212 1 2 r \u22022\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u22022r,\u03c1 \u2212 (1 + 2|m|) r \u2212 2 \u03b2 \u03c12 2 \u03c1 \u2202\u03c1\n\u2212 (1 + p+ |m| \u2212 \u03b2 r) \u2202r + \u03b2 (1 + p+ |m|) . (7)\nSince the operator is Z2-invariant, (\u03c1 \u2192 \u2212\u03c1), this suggests to introduce a new variable u \u2261 \u03c12. In variables (r, u) the operator h (7) takes the form of an algebraic operator with polynomial coefficients\nha(r, u) = \u2212 1\n2 r \u22022r \u2212 2 r u \u22022u \u2212 2 u \u22022r,u \u2212 2 [(1 + |m|) r \u2212 \u03b2 u] \u2202u\n\u2212 (1 + p+ |m| \u2212 \u03b2 r) \u2202r + \u03b2 (1 + p+ |m|) , (8)\nand the eigenvalue problem (3) becomes\nha P = \u03b1P , (9)\nwhere the domain is defined as {r \u2265 \u03c1 \u2265 0}, see Fig.2.\nIt can be immediately checked that the operator ha has the infinitely-many invariant\nsubspaces\nPn = < rpuq | 0 \u2264 p+ 2q \u2264 n > , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , (10)\nha : Pn \u2192 Pn ,\nsee the Newton triangle on Fig.3 as illustration. Note that the dimension of invariant subspace Pn (the number of points inside the Newton triangle including those on its boundaries),\nD \u2261 dimPn = [ n\n2\n][\nn+ 1\n2\n]\n+ n + 1 . (11)\nThis property implies that the eigenfunctions P in (9) are polynomials, which allows us to calculate the eigenvalues in (9),\n\u03b1n = \u03b2(n + 1 + p+ |m|) .\nAssuming that \u03b1n = \u03b1 is fixed, one can find the discrete values of the parameter \u03b2 in the operator (8) for which (9) holds. It defines the family of the operators ha with the same eigenvalue \u03b1. This leads to the well-known formula for energies,\nE = \u2212 \u03b1 2\n2(n + |m|+ p+ 1)2 , (12)\nwhere n is the degree of the eigenpolynomial Pn(r, u) \u2208 Pn, see (10). Hence, the eigenfunctions of the original Hamiltonian (1) are now labelled by three quantum numbers (n, p,m), the combination (n + |m|+ p+1) plays the role of the principal quantum number, which is equal to (nr+\u2113+1) in the usual Coulomb quantum numbers classification of states (nr, \u2113,m).\nExamples I:\n\u2022 n = 0 \u2192 \u03b10 = \u03b2(|m|+ p+ 1) ,\nE0 = \u2212 \u03b12\n2(|m|+ p+ 1)2 , P0 = 1 ,\n\u2022 n = 1 \u2192 \u03b11 = \u03b2(|m|+ p+ 2) ,\nE1 = \u2212 \u03b12 2(|m|+ p+ 2)2 , P1 = 1\u2212 \u03b1 (|m|+ p+ 1)(|m|+ p+ 2) r ,\n\u2022 n = 2 \u2192 \u03b12 = \u03b2(|m|+ p+ 2) ,\nE2 = \u2212 \u03b12\n2(|m|+ p+ 3)2 ,\nP (1) 2 = 1 \u2212\n2\u03b1 (|m|+ p+ 1)(|m|+ p + 3) r + 2\u03b12 (|m|+ p+ 1)(|m|+ p+ 3)2(2|m|+ 2p+ 3) r 2 ,\nP (2) 2 = 1 \u2212\n2\u03b1 (|m|+ p+ 1)(|m|+ p+ 3) r + \u03b12 (|m|+ 1)(|m|+ p+ 1)(|m|+ p+ 3)2 u .\nThis case n = 2 indicates two-fold degeneracy.\nIn general, the polynomials Pn are orthogonal with measure \u0393 2, see (5). It seems evident that these polynomials form a complete basis, although the rigorous proof is absent. Those polynomials are not in the list of known orthogonal polynomials in two variables, see [3] and for a review [4]. For a given n > 0, the degeneracy/multiplicity is equal to n for even n = 2k, while for odd n = 2k+1 it is equal to 2k = n\u2212 1: it is the number of points on the hypotenuse of the Newton triangle shown in Fig.3.\nThe invariant subspace Pn coincides with the finite-dimensional representation space of the algebra g(2): the infinite-dimensional, eleven-generated Lie algebra of differential operators introduced in [5] (see for a discussion [6]) in relation to the G2-integrable (both rational and trigonometric as well as elliptic) system of the Hamiltonian reduction. Generating elements are spanned by the Euler-Cartan generator\nJ\u03030(n) = r\u2202r + 2u\u2202u \u2212 n , (13)\nand\nJ 1 = \u2202r , J 2n = r\u2202r \u2212 n\n3 , J 3n = 2u\u2202u \u2212\nn 3 ,\nJ 4n = r2\u2202r + 2ru\u2202u \u2212 nr = rJ\u03030(n) , (14)\nR0 = \u2202u , R1 = r\u2202u , R2 = r2\u2202u ,\nT0 = u\u22022r , T1 = u\u2202rJ\u03030(n) , T2 = uJ\u03030(n) (J\u03030(n) + 1) = uJ\u03030(n) J\u03030(n\u2212 1) , (15) where n is a parameter. If n is a non-negative integer, the space Pn is the common invariant subspace for the generators (13), (14), (15), where the algebra acts irreducibly.\nThe differential operator ha(r, u) can be written in the g (2)-Lie-algebraic form,\nh(g (2)) a = \u2212 1\n2 J 2nJ 1 \u2212 J 3n R1 \u2212 J 3n J 1 + \u03b2J\u03030(n) \u2212 (16)\n( 1 + p+ |m|+ n 2 ) J 1 \u2212 2 ( 1 + |m|+ n 6 ) R1 + \u03b2 (1 + p+ |m|+ n) ,\nin terms of the generators (13), (14) only. Note that the generators (13), (14) span the non-semi-simple Lie subalgebra gl(2) \u22c9 R3 \u2208 g(2), discovered by Sophus Lie circa 1880 [7] as the algebra of vector fields, see [8] (Cases 24, 28 at r = 2), it was extended to first order differential operators in [9]. In general, the algebra (13), (14) acts on the functions in two variables (r, u). However, in the action on the functions in one variable r, this algebra acts as sl(2)-algebra,\nJ+n = r 2\u2202r \u2212 nr , J0n = 2r\u2202r \u2212 n , J\u2212 = \u2202r . (17)\nThe eigenpolynomials of the operator ha(r, u) (8) do not admit factorization P (r, u) 6= Q1(r)Q2(u). However, it can be seen that in the family of polynomial eigenfunctions in two variables (r, u), there exists an infinite (sub)-family of eigenpolynomials P (r), which depends on the single variable r only. In Examples I this subfamily is represented by P0, P1, P (1) 2 . In this case the operator ha(r, u) degenerates into the Laguerre operator\nha(r) = \u2212 1\n2 r \u22022r \u2212 (1 + p+ |m| \u2212 \u03b2 r) \u2202r + \u03b2 (1 + p+ |m|) , (18)\nand its eigenpolynomials are nothing but the associated Laguerre polynomials. It implies that P0, P1, P (1) 2 are the first three (associated) Laguerre polynomials. In turn, the Laguerre operator has a Lie-algebraic form in terms of generators J 1,J 20 , see (14),\nh (g(2)) a,Lag = \u2212\n1 2 J 20 J 1 + \u03b2J 20 \u2212 (1 + p+ |m|) J 1 + \u03b2 (1 + p+ |m|) . (19)\nLet us note that J 1,J 20 span the Borel subalgebra b2 of the sl(2)-algebra of the first order differential operators, b2 \u2208 sl(2). Needless to say that in terms of the sl(2) generators (17), the operator (18) has the form similar to (19).\nThe phenomenon of the existence of the eigenfunctions of the smaller number of variables than ones, which appear in the Hamiltonian, was systematically observed for many-body problems where the potential depends on relative distances alone [10]. Such a situation is typical for the case of separation of variables. But it is not at all typical when the variables are not separated. This phenomenon was called in [10] beyond the separation of variables.\nQuasi-exact-solvability. It is known that the Coulomb potential admits quasi-exactlysolvable extension in radial direction [11]. In order to see it let us take the operator ha (8) and make gauge rotation of it with Gaussian gauge factor,\nh\u0303 \u2261 eA r 2 2 (ha + rW ) e \u2212A r 2 2 = ha(\u2202r \u2192 \u2202r \u2212 Ar) + rW ,\nwhere A > 0 and W is a function to define. As a result we arrive at\nh\u0303 = ha(r, u) + A\n( r2\u2202r+2 r u \u2202u\u2212n r ) \u2212A 2\n2 r3+Ar\n(\n3 2 +n+p+ |m|\u2212\u03b2 r\n)\n+rW . (20)\nBy choosing W as follows\nW = A2\n2 r2 \u2212 A\n(\n3 2 + n+ p+ |m| \u2212 \u03b2 r\n)\n, (21)\nallows us to vanish the 3rd and 4th terms in the r.h.s. of (20) and we arrive at the quasiexactly solvable operator in algebraic form (with polynomial coefficients)\nh\u0303n(r, u) = ha + A\n( r2\u2202r + 2ru\u2202u \u2212 nr ) =\n\u2212 1 2 r \u22022r \u2212 2 r u \u22022u \u2212 2 u \u22022r,u \u2212 (22)\n2 [(1 + |m|) r \u2212 \u03b2 u\u2212 2Aru] \u2202u \u2212 (1 + p+ |m| \u2212 \u03b2 r \u2212Ar2) \u2202r + \u03b2 (1 + p+ |m|)\u2212Anr ,\nsuch that Pn (10) is their invariant subspace\nh\u0303n : Pn \u2192 Pn .\nIn the g(2)-Lie-algebraic form the operator h\u0303n appears as follows,\nh(g (2),qes) n = h (g(2)) a + A J 4n , (23)\ncf.(16), thus, it involves the \u201cpositive-root\u201d, raising generator J 4n , see (14). The corresponding spectral problem\nh\u0303n P = \u03b1P , (24)\nwhere \u03b1 is the spectral parameter, has a finite number of polynomial eigenfunctions in (r, u) variables equal to the dimension of the invariant subspace D, see (11). It can be checked that among D polynomial eigenfunctions in (r, u) variables the spectral problem (24) has also (n+1) polynomial eigenfunctions in the single variable r. Those polynomial eigenfunctions\nare already known as ones of the one-dimensional radial quasi-exactly-solvable problem [11]. In this case the operator h\u0303n(r, u) (22) degenerates to\nh\u0303n(r) = \u2212 1\n2 r \u22022r \u2212 (1 + p+ |m| \u2212 \u03b2 r \u2212Ar2) \u2202r + \u03b2 (1 + p+ |m|)\u2212Anr ,\ncf. [12]. All other eigenfunctions of (24) are non-polynomials. It is worth presenting several polynomial eigenfunctions explicitly.\nExamples II:\n\u2022 n = 0 (D = 1)\n\u03b1 (qes) 0 = \u03b2 (1 + p+ |m|) ; P0 = 1 ,\n\u2022 n = 1 (D = 2): (two eigenstates)\n\u03b1 (qes) 1,i =\n1 2 ( \u03b2 + 2 \u03b2 \u03c31 \u00b1 \u221a 4A\u03c31 + \u03b22 ) ; P (i) 1 =\n\u03c31\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1(qes)1,i + r ,\nwhere i = +,\u2212 and \u03c3k \u2261 (k + |m|+ p) .\n\u2022 n = 2 (D = 4): (four eigenstates)\n\u03b1 (qes) 2,i \u2261 \u03b12,i , i = 1, 2, 3 ,\nand \u03b12,i are the roots of cubic equation\n\u03b132 \u2212 \u03b122 \u03b2 (\u03c31 + \u03c32 + \u03c33) + \u03b12 [ \u03b22\u03c31\u03c32 + \u03b2 2\u03c31\u03c33 + \u03b2 2\u03c32\u03c33 \u2212 A (4\u03c31 + 1) ]\n+ A\u03b2 \u03c31 (4 \u03c31 + 5) \u2212 \u03b23 \u03c31 \u03c32 \u03c33 = 0 ,\naccordingly\nP (i) 2 = 2A\u03c31 + A\u2212 (\u03b12,i \u2212 \u03b2\u03c32) (\u03b12,i \u2212 \u03b2\u03c33) + 2A (\u03b12,i \u2212 \u03b2\u03c33) r \u2212 2A2 r2 ,\nhere three eigenvalues \u03b12,i and three eigenpolynomials P (i) 2 are related via analytic continuation in A.\n\u03b1 (qes) 2,4 = \u03b2 (3 + p+ |m|) ; P (4) 2 = u \u2212 2(|m|+ 1) 2|m|+ 2p+ 3 r 2 ,\nNote that the eigenpolynomials P0, P (\u00b1) 1 , P (1,2,3) 2 belong to the single-variable family, while the eigenpolynomial P (4) 2 belongs to two-variable family.\nQuasi-exactly-solvable extension of the operator H (2) can be easily constructed\nH\u0302n = H + rW = H + A2\n2 r3 \u2212 Ar\n(\n3 2 + n + p+ |m| \u2212 \u03b2 r\n)\n,\nsee (21), which can immediately be converted into the quasi-exactly-solvable Hamiltonian\nH(qes)(\u03b1) \u2261 1 2 p\u03022 \u2212 \u03b1 r +W = 1 2 p\u03022 \u2212 \u03b1 r \u2212 A\n(\n3 2 +n+ p+ |m| \u2212 \u03b2 r\n)\n+ A2\n2 r2 , (25)\nhere the potential contains the 1 r , r, r2 terms. This Hamiltonian is already known in literature as the quasi-exactly-solvable extension of the Coulomb problem of the second kind under the name generalized Coulomb problem [11], see for review [12], Case VIII, in the radial form when the (generalized) centrifugal barrier is explicitly included. The case (25) corresponds to the absence of the centrifugal term and the kinetic energy given by the standard three-dimensional Laplacian. The Hamiltonian (25) depends on the parameter \u03b1, which for fixed integer n and parameter \u03b2 (hence, the energy, E = \u2212\u03b22/2), is the eigenvalue in the spectral problem (24). In general, the eigenvalues in the spectral problem (24) are different. Different \u03b1\u2019s define different Hamiltonians.\nThe eigenvalue problem\nH(qes)(\u03b1) \u03a8 = E\u03a8 , E = \u2212\u03b2 2\n2 , (26)\nadmits the solutions in the form\n\u03a8 = \u03c1|m| e\u2212\u03b2 r\u2212A r 2 2 zp eim\u03d5 P (r, u) , (27)\nwhere the first D eigenpolynomials are polynomials in (r, u) variables with the same energy E = \u2212\u03b22 2 . Hence, we have D different Hamiltonians where in each of them we know one eigenstate explicitly in the form (27). It implies that new polynomial two-variable eigenfunctions P (r, u) of the Hamiltonian (25) are found(!) in addition to already known one-variable ones P (r).\nAs a conclusion we have to emphasize that in the case of potentials V (r, \u03c1), which are\ninvariant with respect to O(2)\u2295 Z2, the representation (4) can be generalized to\n\u03a8 = \u03c1|m| e\u2212\u03a6(r,\u03c1) zp eim\u03d5 F (r, \u03c1;m, p) . (28)\nwhere \u03a6, F are function to find. This representation was successfully applied to the twobody neutral Coulomb system in a constant uniform magnetic field \u03b3 for the case of two lowest energy states of positive/negative parity: (n = 0, m = 0, p = 0/1) [2], where F = 1. By using the representation (28) the perturbation theory was easily developed,\n\u03a6(r, \u03c1) = \u03b2r + \u03b32\u03a61(r, \u03c1) + . . .+ \u03b3 2k\u03a6k(r, \u03c1) + . . . , F (r, \u03c1) = 1 ,\nalgebraically (for weak magnetic fields) up to a very high order and then few-parametric compact trial functions were built leading to highly accurate results for both energies and quadrupole moment for arbitrary magnetic fields. In the case of excited states with n > 0 the prefactor F (r, \u03c1) carries the information about the nodal lines in (r, \u03c1)-space. This prefactor can be found in the perturbation theory\nF (r, \u03c1) = Pn(r, u;m, p) + \u03b3 2P (1)(r, \u03c1) + . . .+ \u03b32kP (k)(r, \u03c1) + . . . ,\nwhile both corrections \u03a6k(r, \u03c1) and P (k)(r, \u03c1) are polynomials, their coefficients can be calculated by algebraic means. Usually, a polynomial correction P (k)(r, \u03c1) can be written as a finite linear superposition of the polynomials Pn(r, u;m, p). It will be done elsewhere.\nIf in (28) the exponential is chosen as \u03a6(r, \u03c1) = \u03b2r + Ar2/2 the quasi-exactly-solvable problem - the generalized Coulomb problem occurs with pre-factors in the form of the triangular polynomials {Qn(r, u)}i=1,...D \u2208 Pn. In this case each Qn is a linear superposition of the eigenpolynomials P0,1,2,...n of the original Coulomb problem.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nA.V.T. is thankful to P. Iliev (GeorgiaTech, Atlanta, USA) and P.
