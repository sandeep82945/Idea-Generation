    "abstractText": "The presence of any extra radiation energy density at the time of cosmic microwave background formation can significantly impact the measurement of the effective relativistic neutrino degrees of freedom or\u0394Neff, which is very precisely measured by the Planck Collaboration. Here, we propose a scenario where a long-lived inert scalar, which is very weakly coupled to the dark sector, decays to a fermion dark matter via a \u201cfreeze-in\u201d mechanism plus standard model neutrinos at very low temperature \u00f0T < TBBN\u00de. We explore this model in the fast expanding Universe, where it is assumed that the early epoch \u00f0T > TBBN\u00de of the Universe is dominated by a nonstandard species\u03a6 instead of the standard radiation. In this nonstandard cosmological picture, such late-time decay of the inert scalar can inject some entropy to the neutrino sector after it decouples from the thermal bath and this will make substantial contribution to \u0394Neff . Additionally, in this scenario, the new contribution to \u0394Neff is highly correlated with the dark matter sector. Thus, one can explore such feebly interacting dark matter particles by the precise measurement of \u0394Neff using the current (Planck 2018) and forthcoming (CMB-S4 and SPT3G) experiments.",

Additionally, in this scenario, the new contribution to \u0394Neff is highly correlated with the dark matter sector. Thus, one can explore such feebly interacting dark matter particles by the precise measurement of \u0394Neff using the current (Planck 2018) and forthcoming (CMB-S4 and SPT3G) experiments.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.115001\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson by both ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC completes the basic building blocks of standard model (SM) particle physics, albeit some theoretical and experimental shortcomings. The SM with its present setup is unable to explain the observed nonzero neutrino masses and mixings [1\u20136] and the existence of dark matter as indicated by various astrophysical and cosmological measurements [7\u201310]. The resolution of these two fundamental puzzles of particle and astroparticle physics beg for an extension of the SM and a plethora of beyond the standard model (BSM) scenarios have been proposed to address these two issues. The neutrino masses and their mixing angles can be easily accommodated at tree level in the three seesaw mechanisms [11\u201320]. Note that, in addition to the tree-level seesaw mechanisms, small neutrino masses can also be generated radiatively at one loop level [21,22].\nFor a very long time, weakly interacting massive neutral particles (WIMPs) [23\u201328] have been considered as the most coveted candidate for dark matter particles with mass roughly between tens of GeV to a few TeVand sufficiently large (on the order of electroweak strength) interaction with SM particles. WIMPs provide the observed relic abundance \u00f0\u03a9h2 \u223c 0.1198\u00de via the well-known thermal freeze-out mechanism. Nonobservation of any experimental signal [29\u201341] of the dark matter (DM) leads to severe constraints on the WIMP paradigm. To circumvent these constraints on the WIMP scenario,\nan alternative framework called the freeze-in mechanism has been proposed. In this scenario, the dark matter is a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) having highly suppressed interaction strength \u2272O\u00f010\u221212\u00de with the SM sector. In the simplest scenario, it is assumed that the initial number density of DM is either zero or negligibly small, and the observed relic abundance is produced nonthermally, either from annihilation or decay of SM particles in the early Universe. The FIMP freezes in once the temperature drops below the dark matter mass and yields a fixed DM relic abundance that is observed at the present day [42\u201347]. The FIMP, having such a small coupling with the visible sector, can trivially accommodate various null results of DM in different direct detection experiments, such as Panda [29], XENON [30], and LUX [31]. However, FIMP imprints can be traced via cosmological observations such as big bang nucleosynthesis *tpdkg@iacs.res.in \u2020skjeesun48@gmail.com \u2021dnanda@kias.re.kr Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

It would be very interesting to look for a minimal BSM\nparadigm where both the aforementioned sectors (nonzero neutrino mass and FIMP dark matter) are connected. In some particular scenario, such new interactions of neutrinos can have nontrivial implications in cosmological observations and the precision era of cosmological measurements such as BBN or CMB provide us distinctive possibilities for the indirect probe of those hidden particles. We know that one of the very important and precisely\nmeasured observables of the early Universe is the number of effective relativistic neutrino degrees of freedom or Neff which can be changed in the presence of nonstandard interactions of neutrinos. It is usually parametrized as Neff \u2261 \u00f0\u03c1rad \u2212 \u03c1\u03b3\u00de=\u03c1\u03bdL , where \u03c1rad, \u03c1\u03b3, and \u03c1\u03bdL are the total radiation energy density, energy density of the photon, and the energy density of a single active neutrino species, respectively. According to the recent Planck 2018 data [10], at the time of CMB formation NCMBeff \u00bc 2.9\u00fe0.34\u22120.33 with 95% confidence level, whereas the SM predicts it to be NSMeff \u00bc 3.045 [56\u201358]. The departure from three, the number of neutrinos in the SM, is the consequence of various nontrivial effects like noninstantaneous neutrino decoupling, finite temperature QED corrections to the electromagnetic plasma and flavor oscillations of neutrinos. So, there is still some room to accommodate the contribution from the beyond SM physics. However, future generation CMB experiments like SPT-3G [59] and CMB-IV [60] are expected to attain a precision of \u0394Neff \u2248 0.06 at 95% confidence level. Thus, any new contribution to the radiation energy density can be probed very precisely, which can constrain various BSM scenarios that produce light degrees of freedom and are in thermal equilibrium with the SM at early epoch of the evolution of our Universe. On the other hand, different cosmological events such as\ndecoupling of any relic species from the thermal bath or the nonthermal production of some species are sensitive to the evolution history of the Universe. In the standard cosmological picture, it is assumed that, after the end of the inflation, the energy density of the Universe is mostly radiation dominated (RD). However, we only have precise information about the thermal history of the Universe at the time of BBN (TBBN \u223cMeV) and afterward when the Universe was radiation dominated [61,62]. This allows us to consider the possibility that some nonstandard species dominated significantly to the total energy budget of the Universe at early times \u00f0T > TBBN\u00de. In that scenario, if the total energy density is dominated by some nonstandard species, the Hubble parameter (H) at any given temperature is always larger than the corresponding value of H for the standard cosmology at the same temperature. Such a scenario with larger Hubble parameter is known as the fast expanding Universe, where at earlier time (higher\ntemperature) the Universe was matter dominated and eventually at some lower temperature before BBN radiation density \u00f0\u03c1rad\u00de takes over the energy density of the nonstandard species (\u03c1NS). One such possibility was discussed in [63] where \u03c1NS depends on the scale factor as \u223ca\u2212\u00f04\u00fen\u00de, where n > 0. Following the notation of [63], this era of the Universe is identified by temperature Tr, where \u03c1NS\u00f0Tr\u00de \u00bc \u03c1rad\u00f0Tr\u00de. Thus, the nonstandard cosmological era corresponds to the temperature regime where T > Tr. In the limit, n \u00bc 0 corresponds to the standard radiation dominated cosmological picture. This may be realized by introducing a BSM scalar field \u03a6 with equation of state (EOS) p\u03a6 \u00bc \u03c9\u03c1\u03a6, where p\u03a6 and \u03c1\u03a6 denote the pressure and energy density of\u03a6, respectively, and \u03c9 \u2208 \u00bd\u22121; 1 . The energy density prior to BBN redshifts as follows:\n\u03c1\u03a6 \u221d a\u2212\u00f04\u00fen\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere n \u00bc 3\u03c9 \u2212 1. For \u03c9 > 1 3 this energy density will fall faster than the radiation. This scenario has been studied in different contexts in the literature [64\u201369]. We assume this \u03a6 has negligible coupling with the SM sector only so that the only effect it will have is in the expansion rate of the Universe. As the new species redshifts faster than the radiation, its energy density will eventually become subdominant even without the presence of any decay. Several works reported the implications of nonstandard cosmological scenarios in the context of WIMP relic density calculation [63,69\u201374]. It is observed that, if the thermal DM production occurs before TBBN when the expansion rate of the Universe was larger than the RD Universe, freeze-out happens at an earlier time, thus producing higher relic abundance [70\u201372]. Thus, one requires larger coupling of the DM with thermal bath particles to produce a higher DM annihilation cross section at the late Universe so that it produces the relic density that matches with the observed one. Similar studies in the case of nonthermal production of DM have also been investigated [69,74,75]. Various phenomenological implications of the nonstandard cosmology have been extensively studied by several groups [76\u201379]. Motivated by this, we embark on a scenario where the SM particle content is augmented by an inert SU\u00f02\u00de scalar doublet (\u03b7) and three SM gauge singlet fermions \u00f0N1; N2; N3\u00de, where all of them are odd under an unbroken Z2 symmetry [22,80\u201387]. The striking feature of this model is the way it connects the origin of the neutrino mass and DM. Neutrino mass can arise through a one loop radiative seesaw, whereas both \u03b70, the real component of the scalar doublet, and N can be the DM candidate depending on their mass hierarchy. For scalar DM \u00f0\u03b70\u00de, different studies [88\u201391] have shown that the correct relic density can be produced only in the high mass region (M\u03b70 \u2273 525 GeV). However, this scenario can change if we introduce another real gauge singlet scalar S, which is also\n115001-2\nodd under Z2 symmetry and mixes with \u03b70. The immediate consequence of such nontrivial mixing between the singlet (S) and \u03b70 is a newly formed scalar DM (\u03b71) state as a linear superposition of \u03b70 and Swith suppressed gauge interaction compared to the doublet scalar. As a result of this suppressed gauge coupling, the scalar DM can now have mass as low as 200 GeV consistent with the observed relic density [92\u201394]. However, both in the presence or absence of the singlet scalar, the lightest of the singlet fermions Ni can be a plausible thermal DM candidate due to its Yukawa interaction with a new scalar doublet and the SM leptons. In all such cases, the model faces stringent constraints from different direct detection experiments. As discussed above, motivated by the null results of these experiments, here we study another version of the scotogenic model, where the DM is produced via a nonthermal mechanism. In this analysis, instead of a scalar DM, the lightest singlet Z2 odd fermion N1 plays the role of the DM, whereas the lightest neutral scalar (\u03b71), which is the admixture of the real part of the doublet \u00f0\u03b70\u00de and the singlet (S), is very long-lived and decays to DM plus one neutrino at very late time (after neutrino decoupling). If the decay happens at sufficiently low temperature, after the decoupling of active neutrinos from the thermal bath, it can significantly affect the total radiation energy density of the Universe and contribute to the Neff . While calculating the amount of \u0394Neff , we realized that in the standard cosmological scenario the remnant abundance of \u03b71 is not sufficient to produce detectable \u0394Neff in the present experimental sensitivity. We show that the scenario can be significantly changed if our Universe had gone through some nonstandard expansion history. This paper is organized as follows. Section II is devoted to a brief discussion of the basic setup of the model and important interactions. The discussion on dark matter and \u0394Neff is presented in Sec. III, while Sec. IV contains our main numerical results. Finally, we conclude in Sec. V."

We impose an additional Z2 symmetry under which all the SM particles are even, whereas the new fields are odd. In this prescription, the lightest of these Z2-odd particles will be absolutely stable and be a viable DM candidate. With these particles in hand, one can write down the following interaction Lagrangian:\nLfermion \u00bc yi\u03b1liL \u03b7\u0303N\u03b1 \u00fe 1\n2 M\u03b1\u03b2Nc\u03b1N\u03b2 \u00fe H:c:; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere liL is the SM left-handed SU\u00f02\u00deL lepton doublet, yi\u03b1 is the lepton Yukawa coupling of flavors i \u00bc e, \u03bc, and \u03c4, M\u03b1\u03b2 is the symmetric Majorana mass matrix, and\n\u03b7\u0303 \u00bc i\u03c32\u03b7 . The Yukawa interaction, in particular, the yi1 term in Eq. (2), plays the most important role in the dark matter phenomenology discussed later in this paper. The scalar potential of the model V\u00f0\u03d5; \u03b7; S\u00de, followed by its minimization condition and relevant mass and coupling parameters, are shown in the Appendix. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, two neutral\nphysical eigenstates \u03b71 and \u03b72 can be expressed as the linear combination of the weak basis \u03b70 and S as\n\u03b71 \u00bc cos \u03b8\u03b70 \u2212 sin \u03b8S; \u00f03\u00de\n\u03b72 \u00bc sin \u03b8\u03b70 \u00fe cos \u03b8S; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere \u03b8 is the neutral CP-even scalar mixing angle. It is obvious that for \u03b8 \u00bc 0, \u03b71\u00f0\u03b72\u00de doublet (singlet) dominated and vice versa for \u03b8 \u00bc \u03c0=2. The following parameters describe the scalar sector of this model (see the Appendix for details):\nM\u03b71 ;M\u03b72 ;MA0 ;M\u03b7\u00fe ; \u03bb\u03b7; \u03bbS; \u03bb\u03d5S; \u03bb\u03b7S; \u03bb3; sin \u03b8: \u00f05\u00de\nIn addition to these, we also have three right-handed heavy neutrino masses MN1;2;3 . We use the following mass ordering and the importance of this particular mass pattern in the context of our phenomenology will be discussed shortly:\nMN3 ;MN2 ;M\u03b72 > M\u03b71 > MN1 : \u00f06\u00de\nThis mass pattern implies that the lightest Z2-odd fermion N1 is a suitable candidate for the DM having the Yukawa coupling yi1 that features in the production of N1 from the decay of \u03b71. To reveal the implications of heavier scalars in our analysis, we consider three distinct values ofM\u03b7 ;MA0 , and M\u03b72 as represented by three benchmark points BP-1, BP-2, and BP-3 in Table I. There is an interesting manifestation of relative mass\nsplittings among M\u03b71 , M\u03b72 , and MA0 on the dark matter phenomenology, as well as on constraining the model parameter space from the electroweak precision data. As far as heavier neutrino masses MN2;3 are concerned, we set them at O\u00f01\u00de TeV throughout this analysis so that neutrino masses can be generated radiatively in the right ballpark with O\u00f01\u00de Yukawa couplings. Now, a short discussion on the production mechanism of\nthe aforesaid heavy particles and how they remain in\nTABLE I. Values of heavy scalar masses for three benchmark points.\nM\u03b7 (GeV) MA0 (GeV) M\u03b72 (GeV)\nBP-1 180 250 400 BP-2 150 200 400 BP-3 180 220 500\n115001-3\nthermal equilibrium at the early Universe is called for. Both \u03b71 and \u03b72 can be produced in the thermal bath of the early Universe through their interactions with the SM gauge bosons and Higgs boson. Heavy neutrinosNi being a gauge singlet can interact with thermal plasma only through \u03b7 and their presence in the thermal bath solely depends on the Yukawa interactions as shown in Eq. (2). The DM N1 is produced nonthermally from the decay of both \u03b71 and \u03b72 and the respective decay rates depend on the Yukawa coupling yi1 and the corresponding scalar mixing angles cos \u03b8 and sin \u03b8. For our choice of benchmark points (see Table I), \u03b72 mostly decays to W \u03b7\u2213 or ZA0 pairs through gauge interactions, leaving negligible contribution toward N1 production via Yukawa coupling. Hence, for all practical purposes, \u0393\u00f0\u03b72 \u2192 \u03bd\u00fe N1\u00de \u2243 0. Thus, for our choice of \u03b71 and N1 masses, N1 will be produced in association with active neutrinos from the decay of \u03b71 (see Fig. 1) with 100% branching ratio, and the corresponding decay width for one neutrino generation can be written as\n\u0393\u03b71\u2192\u03bdN1 \u00bc y2N1 cos 2 \u03b8M\u03b71 16\u03c0 1 \u2212 M2N1 M2\u03b71 2 ; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere we denote the Yukawa coupling yi1 as yN1 and will use this notation in rest of the paper. From the functional dependence of \u03b71 decay width [Eq. (7)] on yN1 it is clear that for the late-time production of N1 from the decay of \u03b71 via freeze-in mechanism, the Yukawa coupling \u00f0yN1\u00de has to be extremely weak, unlike for the other two heavy neutrinos (N2 and N3) that have O\u00f01\u00de Yukawa interactions with \u03b7. In the presence of such large Yukawa couplings, both N2 and N3 will be produced in thermal equilibrium in the early epoch of the Universe and will decay to other lighter Z2-odd particles (\u03b71, \u03b72, \u03b7 , and A0) after their decoupling from the thermal plasma. Hence, these decays would have no impact in the relic abundance of N1. So far, we were silent about the production of neutrinos in association with N1 from the decay of long-lived \u03b71 and its impact on the dynamics of cosmology. The Yukawa coupling \u00f0yN1\u00de is such that the decay \u03b71 \u2192 N1 \u00fe \u03bd mostly happens after neutrinos decouple from the thermal bath and the decay must also be completed before CMB formation \u00f0T \u2248 1 eV\u00de so that the produced neutrinos in this mechanism have very\nintriguing implications in the observation of the CMB radiation. To fulfill this condition of \u03b71 decay, yN1 cannot take any arbitrary value, rather it should be in the range \u00f0\u223c10\u221215\u201310\u221212\u00de as considered in our analysis. As a result, this decay will inject entropy to the neutrino sector only and will increase the total radiation energy density of the Universe at that epoch. However, any significant increment of total radiation energy density during CMB formation will directly impact \u0394Neff , as discussed earlier and can be observed in different experiments. The same decay will also set the observed relic density of DM in today\u2019s Universe. Hence, the DM mass will decide the amount of energy that gets transferred to the neutrino sector and can directly be related to \u0394Neff . The most important parameters of our discussion are M\u03b71 , \u03bb3, \u03bb\u03d5S, sin \u03b8, MN1 , and yN1 . Among these parameters, M\u03b71 , \u03bb3, and \u03bb\u03d5S decide the annihilation cross sections of \u03b71, and sin \u03b8 decides the mixing of the CP-even real scalars \u03b70 and S. At the completion of \u03b71 decay, the final abundance of physical state \u03b71 gets distributed into DM abundance and active neutrino energy density depending on MN1 and yN1 , thus providing a connection between the DM mass (MN1) and \u0394Neff , and we will explore this in our current endeavor. As we prefer an enhanced comoving number density of \u03b71 in the mass regime M\u03b71 \u2273 60 GeV, various coannihilation processes between dark sector particles must be suppressed in order to avoid any additional enhancement of effective cross section of \u03b71, as this would lead to lower abundance of the comoving number density of \u03b71. The lower yield of \u03b71, in turn, produces lower neutrino number density and this may not be sufficient to induce an observable effect on \u0394Neff . Hence, we suppress the above coannihilation processes by increasing mass splittings between M\u03b71 and other relevant heavy scalar particles of the dark sector. This justifies our choice of associated heavy scalar masses for three benchmarks (BP-1\u2013BP-3) as shown in Table I."

Since N1 is the dark matter particle, it must satisfy the observed relic abundance at the present time. To estimate it, one has to solve the following two coupled Boltzmann equations that showcase the evolution of comoving number densities Y\u03b71 and YN1 , corresponding to \u03b71 and N1, respectively, with the temperature of the Universe:\ndY\u03b71 dx \u00bc \u2212 s H\u00f0x\u00dex 1 \u2212 1 3 d ln gs\u00f0x\u00de d ln x h\u03c3vieff\u00f0Y2\u03b71 \u2212 \u00f0Yeq\u03b71 \u00de2\u00de\n\u2212 h\u0393\u03b71\u2192N1\u03bdi H\u00f0x\u00dex 1 \u2212 1 3 d ln gs\u00f0x\u00de d ln x Y\u03b71 ; \u00f08\u00de\n115001-4\ndYN1 dx \u00bc h\u0393\u03b71\u2192N1\u03bdi H\u00f0x\u00dex 1 \u2212 1 3 d ln gs\u00f0x\u00de d ln x Y\u03b71 ; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere x \u00bc Msc=T is a dimensionless variable with Msc as some arbitrary mass scale that does not affect the analysis, and we consider it to be 100 GeV. Moreover, Yeq\u03b71 is the equilibrium comoving number density of \u03b71, and gs\u00f0x\u00de and H\u00f0x\u00de represent the effective relativistic degrees of freedom related to the entropy density and the expansion rate of the Universe, respectively. The thermal average of the effective annihilation cross section of \u03b71 to the bath particles is denoted by h\u03c3vieff. The entropy density s and Yi\u2019s are related as Yi \u00bc nis where ni\u2019s are the respective number densities. Finally, h\u0393\u03b71\u2192N1\u03bdi denote the thermal average of the decay width given in Eq. (7). While doing our numerical calculation, we take into account all three active neutrinos in h\u0393\u03b71\u2192N1\u03bdi. The evolution equationof the comoving number density of\n\u03b71 is represented by Eq. (8). The first term on the right-hand side of this equation corresponds to the self-annihilation of \u03b71 into the SM sector and vice versa, which keeps \u03b71 in thermal equilibrium. However, in the presence of a tiny Yukawa coupling, \u03b71 slowly decays into N1 \u00fe \u03bd, thus diluting its number density. This feature is reflected in the second termof Eq. (8). Once the DM (N1) is produced in the above decay channel, its thermal evolution is governed by Eq. (9). Note that, in the absence of the Yukawa interaction, \u03b71 becomes stable and plays the role of the DM, having no effect on \u0394Neff , and thus it is not considered in this analysis. We will now discuss the phenomenological consequence\nof late-time decay of \u03b71 into DM and neutrinos which is the motivation of this work. The sufficient production of active neutrinos after it decouples from the thermal bath (T \u2272 2 MeV) can hugely affect the total radiation energy density of the Universe at that time and will finally increase \u0394Neff . The effective number of relativistic neutrinos at the time of CMB can be written as\nNCMBeff \u00bc 8\n7\n11\n4\n4=3 \u03c1\u03bd\n\u03c1\u03b3\nT\u00bcTCMB\n; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere \u03c1\u03bd and \u03c1\u03b3 are the energy densities of neutrinos and photons, respectively. The production of \u03bd\u2019s from some external source will increase its energy density and we parametrize the deviation from the SM value in the following way:\nN0eff NSMeff \u00bc \u03c1 0 \u03bd \u03c1SM\u03bd T\u00bcTCMB ; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere \u03c10\u03bd is the total energy density of neutrinos, i.e., the sum of the SM contribution (\u03c1SM\u03bd ) and the nonthermal contribution \u00f0\u03c1extra\u03bd \u00de coming from the decay of \u03b71. Hence, \u0394Neff can be expressed as follows:\n\u0394Neff \u00bc \u03c10\u03bd \u03c1SM\u03bd \u2212 1 NSMeff\nT\u00bcTCMB\n: \u00f012\u00de\nTo know the temperature evolution of the total neutrino energy density \u03c10\u03bd after the decay of \u03b71, we need to solve the following Boltzmann equation:\nd\u03c10\u03bd dx \u00bc \u2212 4\u03b2\u00f0T\u00de\u03c1 0 \u03bd x \u00fe 1 xH\u00f0x\u00de hE\u0393i\u03b71\u2192N1\u03bdY\u03b71s; \u00f013\u00de\nwhere \u03b2\u00f0T\u00de shows the variation of gs\u00f0T\u00de with T and is defined as\n\u03b2\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc 1\u00fe 1 3 T gs\u00f0T\u00de dgs\u00f0T\u00de dT ; \u00f014\u00de\nand the hE\u0393i\u03b71\u2192N1\u03bd term associated with the thermal average of energy density transferred to the neutrino sector from \u03b71 decay is defined as [95]\nhE\u0393i\u03b71\u2192N1\u03bd \u00bc jMj2\u03b71\u2192N1\u03bd\n32\u03c0\n\u00f0m2\u03b71 \u2212m2N1\u00de m2\u03b71 1 \u2212 m2N1 m2\u03b71 : \u00f015\u00de\nThe first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (13) shows the dilution of \u03c10\u03bd due to expansion of the Universe, whereas the second term shows the enhancement of \u03c10\u03bd with x after the decay of \u03b71. The evolution of \u03c1SM\u03bd after neutrinos decouple from the thermal bath can be easily obtained by setting the term proportional to Y\u03b71 of Eq. (13) to be zero \u00f0\u03c10\u03bd \u00bc \u03c1SM\u03bd \u00de, which dictates the dilution of energy density due to expansion only. From Eq. (13) it is well understood that the total energy density of neutrinos \u00f0\u03c1\u03bd0 \u00bc \u03c1SM\u03bd \u00fe \u03c1extra\u03bd \u00de is decided by the comoving number density (Y\u03b71) of \u03b71 after it freezes out. The freeze-out abundance of \u03b71 depends on its interaction with the bath particles and the expansion rate of the Universe. Freeze-out of \u03b71 occurs at the temperature where the expansion rate H is greater than the interaction rate (h\u03c3vi). Y\u03b71 decreases if the freeze-out happens at late time equivalently at lower temperature, thus making the Hubble parameter an important quantity that determines the abundance Y\u03b71 . In the standard cosmology, where it is assumed that\nthe Universe at the time of DM freeze-out is radiation dominated, the corresponding Hubble parameter (H) is defined as\nH\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 8\u03c0G\u03c1rad\u00f0T\u00de\n3\nr ; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and \u03c1rad\u00f0T\u00de is the radiation energy density which scales as \u223cT4. It turns out that for the range of M\u03b71 considered in our analysis the standard radiation dominated Universe gives \u0394Neff far below the current experimental sensitivity. This is due to the sizable interactions of \u03b71 with the SM bath, in other\n115001-5\nwords large h\u03c3vieff , that keeps \u03b71 in thermal equilibrium for sufficiently longer duration. Such a large annihilation cross section of \u03b71 naturally produces low freeze-out abundance Y\u03b71 as YF:O: \u221d 1=h\u03c3vieff . Hence, the number density of neutrinos produced from such a low yield \u03b71 is not sufficiently large enough to make any significant changes in \u0394Neff that can be measured with current experimental precision. Interestingly, the situation changes drastically if we consider some nonstandard species \u03a6 that dominate the total energy budget of the Universe at early epoch, where the Universe goes through faster expansion at the time of \u03b71 freeze-out. Here one assumes that, in the preBBN era, the energy density of the Universe receives contributions from both the radiation as well as a new species \u03a6. The energy density of \u03a6 scales as \u223ca\u2212\u00f04\u00fen\u00de for n > 0 and can be rewritten in the following form:\n\u03c1\u03a6\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc \u03c1\u03a6\u00f0Tr\u00de gs\u00f0T\u00de gs\u00f0Tr\u00de \u00f04\u00fen\u00de=3 T Tr \u00f04\u00fen\u00de ; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere gs is the effective degrees of freedom contributing to the entropy density. We consider Tr as the temperature where \u03c1\u03a6 \u00bc \u03c1rad. Thus, using the entropy conservation law, one can express the total energy density \u00bd\u03c1\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc \u03c1\u03a6\u00f0T\u00de \u00fe \u03c1rad\u00f0T\u00de at a given temperature T in the following form [63]:\n\u03c1\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc \u03c1rad\u00f0T\u00de 1\u00fe g\u03c1\u00f0Tr\u00de g\u03c1\u00f0T\u00de gs\u00f0T\u00de gs\u00f0Tr\u00de 4\u00fen 3 T Tr n ; \u00f018\u00de\nwhere g\u03c1 is the effective relativistic degrees of freedom. For T > Tr the energy budget of the Universe is dominated by \u03a6. The Hubble parameter H in Eq. (16) is now determined by the total energy density \u03c1\u00f0T\u00de as shown in Eq. (18) instead of only \u03c1rad\u00f0T\u00de. Note that the n \u00bc 0 limit recaptures the standard cosmological picture. Hence, Tr and n are the two important parameters that decide the expansion rate H. For n > 0 the expansion rate of the Universe at a given temperature T is always larger than the corresponding value in the standard radiation dominated (n \u00bc 0) scenario. As a result of this fast expansion, the condition h\u03c3vieff < H\u00f0x\u00de is achieved earlier and \u03b71 freezes out at temperature T higher than than the corresponding temperature in the standard cosmological picture. With such an earlier freeze-out, the abundance Y\u03b71 is large enough to significantly increase the amount of \u0394Neff in our proposed model. However, one should be careful of the potential impact of the above phenomena on the successful predictions of light element abundance by the BBN. If Tr is close to BBN temperature TBBN \u223c 1 MeV, the Universe starts to expand faster than the radiation dominated picture around tBBN and this may modify the theoretical prediction for BBN abundances. To avoid this, Tr must satisfy the following condition [63]:\nTr \u2273 \u00f015.4\u00de1n MeV: \u00f019\u00de Up to this point, we were silent about the nature of \u03a6 or\nthe essential potential that can give rise to expansion faster than the usual RD Universe and treated n and Tr as free parameters. Followed by the discussion in the Introduction, we assume \u03a6 to be a scalar field that is minimally coupled to gravity with a positive self-interacting scalar potential [V\u00f0\u03a6\u00de]. The EOS parameter (\u03c9) lies in the range \u03c9 \u2208 \u00bd\u22121; 1 , i.e., n \u2208 \u00bd\u22124; 2 depending on whether the potential energy V\u00f0\u03a6\u00de or kinetic energy (KE) term dominates [65,96,97]. The former situation is realized if \u03a6 is oscillating about the minimum of a positive potential [65] and has been studied in different contexts [98\u2013101]. On the other hand, the scenario where the Universe\u2019s energy density is dominated by the KE of the scalar field gives rise to the later one (n \u00bc 2), which is often known as kination [64,66\u201368]. Such theories with n \u00bc 2 are realizations of the quintessence fluids motivated to explain accelerated expansion of the Universe [102\u2013104]. However, in this work, we are interested to study how the fast expanding Universe enhances the abundance Y\u03d5 as well as \u0394Neff for any n > 0. In the next section, we will discuss comprehensive\nnumerical analysis of relic density calculation along with \u0394Neff and its phenomenological implications. While doing our numerical analysis, we will vary parameters Tr and n such that they satisfy Eq. (19)."

            "text": "In the previous section, we have argued that if some nonstandard matter field \u03a6 dominates the total energy budget of the Universe at early epoch, the Universe goes through a faster expansion and \u03b71 freezes out early with sufficiently large relic abundance. From \u03b71 the dark matter (N1) and neutrinos are produced via a freeze-in mechanism. Thus, the produced number density of neutrinos is sufficiently large enough to make a substantial new contribution to \u0394Neff which can be verified in the current experiment. In this section, we will scan our model parameter space to quantify this modified \u0394Neff . We will also show that, for a given set of model parameters, \u0394Neff is highly correlated with the dark matter mass MN1 . Any direct experimental verification of FIMP-like dark matter is extremely challenging due its tiny coupling with the SM sector. However, in this scenario, we find that the observed value of \u0394Neff is strongly dependent on MN1 and one can utilize this observable as an experimental probe for FIMP-like dark matter. The presence of additional scalars [SU\u00f02\u00de doublet and a singlet] and three generations of heavy neutrinos can have important implications on various existing experimental data. Hence, to have a phenomenologically consistent model, it is necessary to carefully scrutinize the aforementioned BSM scenario in light of those\n115001-6\nexperimental data. In addition to these, mathematical consistency of the scenario also demands that various model parameters must satisfy certain theoretical conditions. However, for the brevity of the analysis, we will not discuss these here; nevertheless, further details can be seen in [92]. We will first discuss the full numerical solutions to the Boltzmann equations corresponding to Y\u03b71 Eq. (8) and YN1 Eq. (9), respectively. For this analysis, we first implement the interactions, mass, and mixings of the model in FeynRules [105], that generate required CALCHEP [106] model files for micrOMEGAs [107] to calculate a thermally averaged cross section h\u03c3vieff . To showcase the behavior of Y\u03b71 and YN1 with temperature T, we consider M\u03b71 \u00bc 65 GeV,1 MN1 \u00bc 10 MeV, \u03bb3 \u00bc 10\u22123, \u03bb\u03d5S \u00bc 10\u22123, sin \u03b8 \u00bc 0.9, and the Yukawa coupling yN1 \u00bc 10\u221212. It is worth pointing out that those parameters are consistent with all theoretical and experimental constraints discussed earlier. We have two additional parameters Tr and n that fix the cosmological framework of our present scenario. The comoving number densities Y\u03b71 and YN1 for \u03b71 and N1 are plotted as a function of x for n \u00bc 1 [Fig. 2(a)] and n \u00bc 2 [Fig. 2(b)], respectively. In Fig. 2(a), blue and magenta lines correspond to Tr \u00bc 20 and 100MeV, while in Fig. 2(b) the corresponding two colored lines represent Tr \u00bc 5 and 100 MeV, respectively. From Eqs. (16) and (18) one can find that, in the presence of an extra contribution to the energy density of the Universe, the Hubble parameter H goes like \u223cT2\u00f0T=Tr\u00den=2, \u00f0T \u226b Tr\u00de and this explains why the expansion rate of the Universe increases with the increase in n (for n > 0), which ultimately leads to an earlier freeze-out of \u03b71 with higher abundance. This feature of a fast expanding Universe is nicely evinced in both Figs. 2(a)\nand 2(b), where comoving number densities for \u03b71 as well as N1 are higher for n \u00bc 2 compared to n \u00bc 1 for a fixed Tr \u00bc 100 MeV (magenta lines). It is clearly evident from Fig. 2 that \u03b71 decouples from the thermal bath first and then decays into N1 \u00fe \u03bd at some later time, which basically increases the dark matter comoving number density YN1. In addition, one can also notice from Fig. 2 that, for a fixed n, Y\u03b71 decreases with the increase in Tr and this can be once again traced back to the parametric dependence of the Hubble parameter H on Tr and n as mentioned earlier. In summary, both Y\u03b71 and YN1 increase with an increase in n for a given Tr, while they decrease with an increase in Tr for any value of n \u2265 1. Interestingly, both of these observations can be interpreted in terms of the modified Hubble parameter H\u00f0T\u00de in the fast expanding Universe. After illustrating the importance of the fast expanding\nUniverse in the calculation of relic abundances for both \u03b71 and N1, we now scan the independent parameters of the model in the following range:\n\u03bb3 \u2208 \u00bd10\u22126\u2236 10\u22122 ; \u03bb\u03d5S \u2208 \u00bd10\u22126\u223610\u22122 ; \u00f020\u00de\nM\u03b71 \u2208 \u00bd50\u2236100 GeV ; MN1 \u2208 \u00bd1\u22361000 MeV ; \u00f021\u00de\nsin \u03b8 \u2208 \u00bd0.0\u22360.9 : \u00f022\u00de\nThe purpose of this scan is to find a region in the multidimensional model parameter space that is allowed by both theoretical and experimental constraints as well as satisfy the correct relic density [92,108\u2013111]. We will then use those allowed parameters to calculate the value of\u0394Neff in our model that can be substantiated in the upcoming experiments. Throughout this analysis, we fix the mass of the SM-like Higgs to 125 GeV. One can notice that we vary sin \u03b8 in the above range (0.0\u20130.9) so that we can capture the\n1For this value of M\u03b71 , h \u2192 \u03b71\u03b71 is kinematically forbidden and hence no constraints from BRh \u2192 inv.\n115001-7\neffect of both the SU\u00f02\u00de doublet \u03b70 and singlet S scalars in the freeze-in production of the DM in \u03b71 decay, where the heavy scalar \u03b71 becomes doublet (singlet) dominated for sin\u03b8\u00bc0\u00f00.9\u00de. For this analysis, we fix n\u00bc2, Tr \u00bc 5 MeV, and the Yukawa coupling yN1 \u00bc 10\u221212. Varying the Yukawa coupling in the range as mentioned in Sec. II will have no impact on relic density because\n\u03a9DMh2 \u00bc 2.755 \u00d7 108YDM MDM GeV ;\nandYDM will always be the same asY\u03b71\u00f0xf:o:\u00de. At the end, the parameter scan result in the M\u03b71 \u2212 sin \u03b8 plane is visible in Fig. 3, where DMmassMN1 is represented by the color bar. As one can observe, a significant region of the parameter space in Fig. 3 has been excluded by various theoretical and experimental constraints. The Br\u00f0h \u2192 inv\u00de < 11% excludes the region with M\u03b71 < Mh=2 and this is the gray colored vertical patch marked as Br\u00f0h \u2192 inv\u00de > 11% [111]. The electroweak precision data (EWPD) through S, T, and U parameters serve another crucial limit on the parameter space of this model. It is well known that the larger the mass splitting between the components of the SU\u00f02\u00de doublet field, the stronger is the EWPD constraints [92]. Indeed, this is happening in the case of our threebenchmarkpoints shown in Table I. The EWPD data exclude three diagonal bands corresponding to BP-1, BP-2, and BP-3, respectively, in Fig. 3. From this figure, it is clear that BP-3, which has the largest mass gap betweenM\u03b72 andM\u03b7 , attracts the strongest EWPD limit and it excludes sin \u03b8 \u2272 0.6\u20130.775 for M\u03b71 \u2248 62.5 GeV and sin \u03b8 \u2272 0.6\u20130.75 for M\u03b71 \u00bc 100 GeV. Thus,\nthe overall allowed region is located at the upper quadrilateral part of the parameter space, with sin \u03b8 \u223c 0.775\u20130.9 and M\u03b71 \u223c 62.5\u2013100 GeV. Another important outcome of our analysis is that for a fixed sin \u03b8 any increase inMN1 also calls for an increase inM\u03b71 to satisfy the correct density and Fig. 3 perfectly corroborates our claim. However, one has to look for any physical processes that may imperil the effect of the long-lived scalar on CMB in the singlet-doublet scotogenic model. In this scenario, the presence of other heavy scalars may lead to DM coannihilation processes that may boost the h\u03c3v\u2273ieff and such enhanced h\u03c3vieff ultimately suppresses \u03b71 abundance. The immediate consequence of this low yield \u03b71 is the tiny production of an additional neutrino density \u03c10\u03bd that may not lead to any significant shift in \u0394Neff, thus spoiling the intention of this analysis. The most natural way to circumvent this situation is to take other particles of the model very heavy compared toM\u03b71 (largemass splittings) so that one can easily ignore the coannihilation of \u03b71 with those heavier particles. To facilitate this, in our analysis we choose three representative benchmark points (BP-1\u2013BP-3) as shown in Table I. After having a suitable model parameter space consistent\nwith various constraints, we are now in a position to kick off the numerical estimation of the ratio \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd . For this we need to solve Eqs. (8) and (13) to evaluate the evolution of \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd as a function of the dimensionless variable x. In Fig. 4(a) we display the dependence of \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd as a function of x for three different values of M\u03b71 (65 GeV, solid cyan line; 67 GeV, brown dot-dashed line; 70 GeV, blue dashed line) where the other parameters are kept fixed (\u03bb3 \u00bc 10\u22123, \u03bb\u03d5S \u00bc 10\u22123, MN1 \u00bc 10 MeV, sin \u03b8 \u00bc 0.9, n \u00bc 2, Tr \u00bc 5 MeV) for a constant Yukawa coupling yN1 \u00bc 10\u221212. From Fig. 4(a) one can clearly discern that, at very high temperature T, \u03b71 stays in thermal equilibrium for M\u03b71 \u00bc 65 GeV with no additional contribution to \u03c10\u03bd from \u03b71, thus the ratio \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd is almost unity. However, as the Universe starts cooling, the decay \u03b71 \u2192 N1 \u00fe \u03bd also proceeds through tiny Yukawa coupling yN1 and it leads to new contributions to the neutrino energy density. This additional contribution makes the ratio \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd greater than 1. The decay of \u03b71 continues until its number density is completely converted into N1 and \u03bd number densities. At that point, no further neutrinos are generated and the \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd saturates. This feature is repeated for the other two values of M\u03b71 \u00bc 67 and 70 GeV in Fig. 4(a) with a marked difference. For a higher value of M\u03b71 , the thermally averaged cross section \u00f0h\u03c3vi\u00deeff of \u03b71 with SM particles increases due to larger phase space availability. This elevated cross section leads to the late-time freeze-out of \u03b71 with smaller abundance. Subsequently, the late-time decay of \u03b71 produces neutrinos with suppressed energy density [92]. From this analysis, we conclude that, for a fixed value of x, the ratio \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd is the largest (smallest) for M\u03b71 \u00bc 65 (70) GeV, respectively.\n115001-8\nThe Yukawa coupling yN1 also controls the temperature T variation of the ratio \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd for a fixed \u03b71 mass. In Fig. 4(b), we show such variation of \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd with x assuming three different values of yN1 (5 \u00d7 10\n\u221212, brown dashed line; 1 \u00d7 10\u221212, solid cyan line; 5 \u00d7 10\u221213, blue dotdashed line) forM\u03b71 \u00bc 67 GeV, while other parameters are the same as in Fig. 4(a). For a given mass of \u03b71 and N1 and keeping other model parameters fixed, the decay of \u03b71 \u2192 N1 \u00fe \u03bd is completely determined by the Yukawa coupling yN1 . In addition, the larger the coupling yN1 , the faster is the decay rate of \u03b71 and vice versa. For a given yN1 , the ratio keeps on increasing with the expansion of the Universe and ultimately saturates when the decay of \u03b71 is completed. For any higher yN1, the aforementioned decay of \u03b71 gets completed even at an earlier time (equivalently, at higher temperature T) and the energy injection to the neutrino sector also completes at earlier epoch of the Universe. This phenomena is distinctly noticeable from Fig. 4(b) that the ratio saturates earlier with increase in yN1 . As the higher value of the Yukawa coupling forces the \u03b71 decay to be completed at an earlier time, the new contribution to neutrino energy density \u03c10\u03bd from this decay gets diluted more due to the expansion of the Universe. However, with lower Yukawa coupling yN1 \u00bc 5 \u00d7 10\u221213, the decay starts later and the corresponding energy injection to neutrino sector also gets completed at a later time (lower temperature) and hence gets less diluted due to the expansion of the Universe. Consequently, one gets a higher value of \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd at lower temperature (x \u2248 107) as depicted in Fig. 4(b). After highlighting the variation of \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd with various model parameters, we now use \u03c10\u03bd=\u03c1SM\u03bd to calculate the\n\u0394Neff by scanning over those model parameters and the corresponding upshot is displayed in \u0394Neff vsM\u03b71 plane in Fig. 5. The color bar represents the value of MN1 in the range 1\u2013100 MeV. Here we consider BP-1, as the maximum allowed region from EWPD constraints correspond to this particular benchmark point. Similarly, other parameter space points satisfy the correct relic density as well being consistent with other theoretical and experimental constraints. In the calculation of \u0394Neff , we vary the DM mass\n115001-9\nMN1 from 1 to 100 MeV, and it is conspicuous from Fig. 5, that with increase in MN1 , the numerical value of \u0394Neff decreases. This is understandable, as a higher value ofMN1 requires lower abundance YN1 so that the correct relic density (\u03a9h2 \u223c YN1MN1) is achieved. In our earlier discussions, we have shown that the evolution of N1 abundance is governed by Y\u03b71 [Fig. 2(a)]; thus lower YN1 also corresponds to smaller \u03b71 abundance Y\u03b71 . With this lower abundance of \u03b71, lesser energy gets transferred to the neutrino sector, leading to a smaller value of \u0394Neff . For this scan, we consider fixed yN1 \u00bc 10\u221212. We may decrease yN1 that would lead an increase in\u0394Neff as understood from Fig. 4(b) and will make the scenario more viable to the observations. However, the DM phenomenology will remain same. We also show the exclusion limit of \u0394Neff from different present and future generation experiments. The present 2\u03c3 limit from Planck (2018) on \u0394Neff \u00bc 0.285 excludes the DMmass between \u223c1 and 2 MeV, whereas the 1\u03c3 limit from Planck (2018) on \u0394Neff \u00bc 0.12 excludes DM mass in the range \u223c3\u20134 MeV. It is also important to note that future generation experiments such as the SPT-3G [59] with 1\u03c3 limit on \u0394Neff \u00bc 0.1 and the CMB-S4 [60] with 2\u03c3 limit on\u0394Neff \u00bc 0.06will be able to probe the DMmass up to \u223c7 and \u223c10 MeV, respectively. Hence, with the present and future generation experimental measurement of \u0394Neff we can indirectly probe the freeze-in DM in this scenario and also rule out certain mass ranges of such feebly interacting dark matter."

            "heading": "V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION",
            "text": "We have discussed a minimal extension of the SM by an inert SU\u00f02\u00deL scalar doublet (\u03b7), a real scalar singlet (S), and three right-handed singlet fermions (N1; N2, and N3), where all of them are odd under Z2 symmetry. However, the SM particles are even under the above-mentioned Z2 symmetry. The study has been restricted to the regime where MN1 is lightest new particle in the spectrum and plays the role of a stable DM candidate. Due to the chosen Z2 symmetry, Ni\u2019s can only interact with SM particles through the Yukawa interaction with \u03b7 and SM lepton doublet. We have assumed that the interaction of N1 is very feeble, which is decided by the Yukawa coupling \u00f0yN1 \u2272 10\u221212\u00de. Such a small interaction of N1 prevents its production in the thermal bath. Rather, N1 has been produced from the nonthermal decay of the long-lived lightest scalar \u03b71, which is one of the neutralCP-even scalar mass eigenstates obtained by diagonalizing the 2 \u00d7 2masssquare matrix in \u00f0\u03b70; S\u00de basis. The masses of all the other Z2-odd particles are sufficiently large and have no phenomenological consequences in the DM analysis. The SM neutrino masses can be generated through a one loop process via interactions of Ni and \u03b71 with the SM leptons. However, with such tiny Yukawa interaction, N1 is almost\ndecoupled from the neutrino mass generation and as a result one of the active neutrinos becomes almost massless. We have first checked the effects of different model parameters on the relic density of DM by solving the required Boltzmann equations. We have found that constraints coming from the electroweak precision data as well as the invisible decay of the SM Higgs boson ruled out a significant fraction of the model parameter space. We have seen that, in the standard radiation dominated Universe, the number densities of the mother particles (\u03b71) which have sizable interactions with the SM bath become smaller and have negligible impact on the \u0394Neff . On the other hand, if the early epoch of the expansion was dominated by some nonstandard species, that can change the outcome by causing faster expansion of the Universe. In this fast expanding Universe scenario, apart from producing the right amount of DM relic density, the late-time decay of \u03b71 can significantly impact the total radiation energy density on the start of CMB formation and puts further constraints to the allowed parameter space of the model. In order to calculate the amount of \u0394Neff , we have found the amount of energy density of neutrinos coming from the decay of \u03b71 by solving the required Boltzmann equation. The present 2\u03c3 limit on \u0394Neff from Planck 2018 data excludes the DM mass as heavy as 2 MeV, as in the case of lighter DM mass, more and more energy gets converted to neutrinos and increases the value of \u0394Neff . However, future generation experiments like SPT-3G and CMB-IV will be able to probe the dark matter mass as heavy as \u223c10 MeV. Thus, the analysis performed in this paper can be considered as an alternative way to probe the FIMP dark matter scenario by the precise determination of \u0394Neff using current and future CMB data."
