We combine tools from these two sciences to develop a technique for predictive work extraction from non-Markovian stochastic processes with quantum outputs. We demonstrate that this technique can extract more work than non-predictive quantum work extraction protocols, on the one hand, and predictive work extraction without quantum information processing, on the other.

The second law of thermodynamics holds that no engine can sustainably function with a single reservoir [1, 2, 3, 4]. While thought experiments such as Maxwell\u2019s demon and Szilard\u2019s engine initially appear to defy this law [5], a more complete understanding of thermodynamics resolved the apparent paradox: the resource powering the engine need not be a temperature gradient, but may be any form of free energy\u2014even information [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics has continued to expand the scope of \u201cfuel\u201d to increasingly general forms of free energy [11, 12]. There has been both theoretical and experimental advancement in constructing engines that can harness the free energy locked up in quantum coherence, over and above classical free energy [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nThe story does not stop there\u2014in addition to static fuel, there is also a dynamical fuel-like resource embodied by complex thermodynamic processes. The framework of computational mechanics in complexity science offers powerful techniques for the characterization and manipulation of stochastic processes. The future behaviour of such a process in general cannot be known perfectly using data from its past. Nevertheless, temporal correlations, i.e., patterns in a process\u2019s behaviour over time, enable prediction. These correlations may even be non-Markovian, whereby the future of a process depend not only on its present, but also on its distant past.

            "text": "Here, we develop the theoretical prototype for a predictive quantum engine: a machine that charges a battery by feeding on a multipartite quantum system whose parts are temporally correlated via a classical stochastic process. In other words, the engine\u2019s fuel is a classical stochastic process with quantum outputs. It can extract free energy beyond what is accessible to current quantum engines or classical predictive engines. We present a systematic construction of such an engine for arbitrary classical processes and quantum output states. We illustrate its application on example stochastic processes of correlated non-orthogonal qubits. (Fig. 1). We also use this test case to benchmark the performance of our engine against various alternatives, including one without coherent quantum information processing, and one without predictive functionality. Our predictive quantum engine outperforms these alternatives in terms of work output. We show that parametrized processes of correlated non-orthogonal quantum outputs exhibit phase boundaries between parametric regions where memory of past observations can and cannot enhance the work yield\u2014despite the apparently smooth change of memoryful correlations in the process across this boundary. The sudden lack of memory advantage is thus fundamentally thermodynamic (since prediction per se has more freedom than during work extraction) and fundamentally quantum (since classical engines can exploit all the process\u2019s inherent memory). Finally, we generalize the Information Processing Second Law (IPSL) to the quantum regime and derive the fundamental bounds on a quantum pattern engine\u2019s performance.\nWe begin by introducing stochastic processes as a source of quantum states that will fuel our engine in Section 1.2. Section 2 shows how general interactions with the correlated quantum states induce belief states that enable optimal prediction and work extraction. We then illustrate how a theoretical pattern engine can be\nconstructed in Section 3. The performance of the engine on an example process is then evaluated in Section 4. This leads to the discovery and explanation of the aforementioned phase transition in the efficacy of memory. The fundamental limit of a pattern engine is then derived in Section 5, and finally we draw our conclusion in Section 6."

            "text": "Typically in quantum information theory, sources of quantum states are assumed to be memoryless, producing independent and identically distributed (IID) quantum states at each discrete time [22, 23]. On the contrary, nature abounds with rich dynamics. To go beyond the IID paradigm, we consider general finite-state sources of quantum states, which can create highly nontrivial correlations across time. Some simple examples are depicted in Fig. 1 Temporally patterned quantum outputs provide fuel for any entity capable of predicting them. Appendix A shows that any change in total correlation among outputs, as quantified by quantum relative entropy, changes nonequilibrium free energy proportionally. Correlations are therefore a source of free energy.\nThese memoryful sources of quantum states can be represented by a hidden Markov model\n(HMM) M = ( S, ( \u03c3(x) ) x\u2208X , ( T (x) ) x\u2208X ) . Here, S is the HMM\u2019s set of classical latent states. The random variable representing the latent state at time t shall be denoted by St. The transitionmatrix element T (x) s,s\u2032 = Pr(St = s\u2032, Xt = x|St\u22121 = s) represents the probability of transitioning from latent state s to s\u2032 and emitting the ddimensional quantum state \u03c3(x).\nFor simple HMMs, the memoryful transition structure can be visualized as an annotated directed graph, as in Fig. 1. In this graphical representation, nodes correspond to latent states while the directed edges correspond to latent-state-tostate transitions that produce a certain quantum output with a prescribed probability.\nIn the example of Fig. 1(a), the \u2018biased-coin process\u2019 has only two latent states s and s\u2032. At each timestep, the latent state switches with probability p. The quantum output is \u03c3(0) whenever the resultant state is s; The quantum output is \u03c3(1) whenever the resultant state is s\u2032. As the switching-probability p approaches 1, the process\napproaches a period-two output, alternating between the two quantum states . . . \u03c3(0) \u2297 \u03c3(1) \u2297 \u03c3(0) \u2297 \u03c3(1) . . . . At the other extreme, as p approaches 0, the latent state remains the same for increasingly long epochs that produce long strings of the same quantum output . . . \u03c3(0) \u2297 \u03c3(0)\u2297\u03c3(0)\u2297\u03c3(0) . . . or . . . \u03c3(1)\u2297\u03c3(1)\u2297\u03c3(1)\u2297\u03c3(1) . . . switching between the two behaviors only rarely. More generally, for any p \u2208 (0, 1), the process interpolates between these two extreme behaviors.\nMore complicated HMMs can generate more complex memoryful structure in the quantumoutput process. See Fig. 1(b) for a hint of this possible richness.\nThe HMM specifies the statistics of the nonMarkovian classical variables Xt across time, which, in turn, induce the quantum outputs indexed by x \u2208 X . The quantum output process is described by the (formal) density operator\n\u03c1\u2190\u2192 A = \u2211 \u2190\u2192x Pr (\u2190\u2192x ) \u2297 t\u2208Z \u03c3 (xt) At , (1)\nwhere each time step t is associated with a unique elementary physical system At, and\n\u2190\u2192x = . . . x\u22121x0x1 . . . denotes a bi-infinite string over X . The joint quantum state is separable amongst the Ats, but can have non-classical correlations in the form of discord [24]. These memoryful quantum sources generalize the kindred \u2018classically controlled qubit sources\u2019 of Ref. [25].\nThe time-indexed sequence of stochastically-\ngenerated quantum outputs \u03c3 (xt) At\nof such a process acts as a \u201cfuel tape\u201d that is fed to the engine (Fig. 2) one At at a time, in a temporal order. If the quantum states could all be stored for a later time, then it would be straightforward\nto extract all nonequilibrium addition to free energy from the correlated quantum tape, by acting on the full sequence all at once [13], since the multipartite system could then be treated as a single quantum system. Rather, we consider a setting where each elementary physical system has an immediate expiration date\u2014the engine can interact with At at the present time t, and then never again. This time-locality restriction is shared with the information-ratchet [8, 21] and repeated-interaction [23] frameworks. The challenge here is to extract maximal free energy when forced to act only locally and sequentially on the correlated quantum pattern.\nExcept for being constrained by a stationary finite-state source, the fuel process can be arbitrary in its alphabet size, statistics, and quantum outputs\u2019 finite dimensionality and form\u2014\u03c3(x) could be a pure or mixed state over any number of quantum degrees of freedom. Notice that here the form of the set of {\u03c3(x)}x\u2208X does not vary with time, hence the lack of t index. To simplify notation, we will omit the system label At unless required.\nWe assume that the source of the fuel tape is known exactly. This entails a complete knowledge of the underlying classical statistics and of the indexed set of quantum states {\u03c3(x)}x\u2208X , but not of which specific string \u2190\u2192x is instantiated."

            "text": "To fully leverage the structure of the pattern, the engine must dynamically incorporate information from past interactions with the elementary quantum systems, so that the engine\u2019s memory becomes correlated with the latent state of\nthe source. This can be done by tracking\u2014within the internal memory M of the engine\u2014an interaction-induced belief state \u03b7t about the latent state of the source.\nThe type of interaction between engine and fuel at each time can depend on the memory of the engine. The general interaction and observation at time t can be described by a positive operator\u2013valued measure (POVM) on the Hilbert space of the elementary fuel system At; Let Ot denote the random variable for the observed outcome thereof.\nThe optimal belief state \u03b7t at time t is an observation-induced probability distribution over the latent states S of the source with probability elements\n\u03b7t(s) = Pr(St = s|O1 . . . Ot = o1 . . . ot) . (2)\nThis is the best knowledge that a local classical memory can have, as it represents the actual distribution over latent states as one would calculate via Bayes rule. It is convenient to treat \u03b7t as a length-|S| row vector for linear algebraic manipulation. Given a sequence of observations, what is the probability Pt(x) that the source will next produce quantum state \u03c3(x)? It is Pt(x) = \u03b7tT (x)1, where 1 is the column vector of all ones. The belief state \u03b7t thus determines an expectation of the next quantum state\n\u03bet = \u2211 x\u2208X Pt(x)\u03c3(x) , (3)\nwith more free energy than the local reduced state \u03be0 of \u03c1\u2190\u2192A . This memory enhancement to free energy is proven in App. B.\nThe transition rules between these belief states are determined via Bayesian inference, based on the anticipated distribution of the observable Ot. If the source is known, but no observations have yet been made, then the optimal belief state is simply the stationary distribution over source states: \u03b70 = \u03c0, which satisfies \u03c0 = \u03c0 \u2211 x\u2208X T (x).\nTheorem 1. For any POVM on the quantum state of the system at time t, the optimal belief state\u2014about the latent state of the quantum source\u2014updates iteratively according to\n\u03b7t = z\u22121t \u2211 x\u2208X Pr(Ot = ot|Xt = x,Kt\u22121 = \u03b7t\u22121)\u03b7t\u22121T (x)\n(4)\nwhere Kt is the random variable for the belief state, and zt = \u2211 x\u2032\u2208X Pr(Ot = ot|Xt = x\u2032,Kt\u22121 = \u03b7t\u22121)\u03b7t\u22121T (x \u2032)1 is a normalizing factor.\nWe derive Thm. 1 in Appendix C, generalizing the so-called mixed-state presentation [26, 27, 28, 29, 30].\nThe probability Pr(Ot = ot|Xt = x,Kt\u22121 = \u03b7t\u22121) appearing in Eq. (4) is typically a straightforward physics calculation of the probability that the observed POVM outcome ot should be obtained, given that the system was prepared as \u03c3(x). Conditioning on the previous state of knowledge Kt\u22121 is important to the extent that it can influence the choice of POVM applied at time t.\nNotice that, for each o, the update rule for the belief state can be interpreted as a nonlinear return map. If the return map enables prediction, then we have some access to the nonequilibrium free energy in correlations.\nObservation 1. Memory can be thermodynamically advantageous when the belief-state update rule has an attractor other than the stationary fixed point \u03c0 for at least one observable outcome."

            "text": "The engine is equipped with an internal classical memory M and access to a heat reservoir R at some fixed temperature T . Its objective is to extract work by raising the internal energy of a work reservoir or \u2018battery\u2019B. To accomplish this, it can bring each system At closer to its equilibrium state \u03b3 = e\u2212H/kBT /Z, kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, and Z = Tr(e\u2212H/kBT ) is the associated equilibrium partition function that yields the equilibrium free energy F = \u2212kBT lnZ. For simplicity of presentation, we assume that each subsystem At is subject to the same Hamiltonian H, but our results generalize in an obvious way if we allow different Hamiltonians for each subsystem. The construction of the pattern engine then requires only the description of the HMM M and the Hamiltonian H.\nTo harvest the free energy locked up in correlations, the engine\u2019s internal memory should somehow become correlated with the latent state of the source during its energy-harvesting opera-\ntion. However, directly measuring each quantum system would disturb the state and potentially cost energy. Rather, our engine updates its memory conditioned on the extracted-work value Wt at each time. The change in the energy of the battery thus serves as the observable Ot = Wt for updating the belief state.\nAt each time step, conditioned on its memory state, the engine performs a work-extraction protocol\u2014a unitary transformation of the composite At, B, and R supersystem, designed to transfer energy from At to B.\nAt best, the work-extraction protocol at time step t would extract all the nonequilibrium addition to free energy kBTD[\u03c1\u2217t \u2225\u03b3] when it acts on a chosen state \u03c1\u2217t , where D[\u03c1\u2225\u03b3] = Tr(\u03c1 ln \u03c1) \u2212 Tr(\u03c1 ln \u03b3) is the quantum relative entropy. These are the \u03c1\u2217-ideal work-extraction protocols, which we define as any work-extraction protocol that satisfies the following:\n(i) When the initial state of the system is \u03c1\u2217, it achieves zero entropy production, transferring on-average all nonequilibrium addition to free energy kBTD[\u03c1\u2217\u2225\u03b3] to a work reservoir, B;\n(ii) It conserves energy globally among the reduced states of At, B, and R when acting on any eigenstate of \u03c1\u2217.\nOur next theorem fully characterizes the set of extracted values and their probabilities for any such protocol (see Appendix D for the derivation).\nTheorem 2. Each \u03c1\u2217-ideal work-extraction protocol exhibits at most d distinct extracted-work values. These extracted-work values can be expressed, in terms of the ideal input\u2019s spectral decomposition \u03c1\u2217 = \u2211 n \u03bbn |\u03bbn\u27e9 \u27e8\u03bbn|, as\nw(n) := \u27e8\u03bbn|H |\u03bbn\u27e9+ kBT ln\u03bbn \u2212 F (5)\nwith associated probabilities\nPr ( W = w(n)|\u03c3 ) = \u2211 m \u27e8\u03bbm|\u03c3 |\u03bbm\u27e9 \u03b4w(n),w(m) (6)\nThis set of values is independent of the actual ddimensional quantum state \u03c3 input to the protocol, although the input state determines the probabilities of each outcome.\nNotably, this yields the probability distribution for work extracted when the protocol optimized for \u03c1\u2217t actually operates on \u03c3\n(x). Regardless of how the belief state influences the choice of \u03c1\u2217t , we can now leverage Thms. 1 and 2 to rewrite the belief update as \u03b7t+1 = \u2211 x\u2208X \u2211 n \u03b4wt+1,w(n) \u27e8\u03bbn|\u03c3 (x) |\u03bbn\u27e9 \u03b7tT (x)\u2211\nn \u03b4wt+1,w(n) \u27e8\u03bbn| \u03bet |\u03bbn\u27e9 .\n(7)\nWith Eq. (7), the belief-state return maps now reflect the physics of the work-extraction protocol.\nFrom Eqs. (3) and (6), we find that the workinduced transitions between belief states have probabilities\nPr(Wt+1 = w|Kt = \u03b7t) = \u2211\nn\n\u27e8\u03bbn|\u03bet|\u03bbn\u27e9 \u03b4w,w(n) .\n(8)\nFinally, to take thermodynamic advantage of this knowledge, the work-extraction protocol at each step1 is optimized for the expected state, so that \u03c1\u2217t = \u03bet. Indeed, extracting all work from the expected state \u03bet requires a protocol designed around this expectation [31]. In this case, the denominator in Eq. (7) simplifies to\u2211\nn \u03bbn \u03b4wt+1,w(n) . Similarly, Eq. (8) simplifies to\u2211 n \u03bbn \u03b4w,w(n) . Combining Eqs. (5) and (8), we compute \u27e8Wt\u27e9 = \u2211 \u03b7,w wPr(Kt\u22121 = \u03b7) Pr(Wt = w|Kt\u22121 = \u03b7)\n(9)\nand find\n\u27e8Wt\u27e9 = kBT \u27e8D[\u03bet\u2225\u03b3]\u27e9Pr(Kt) . (10)\nNote that the expectation value on the righthand side is taken over the instantaneous distribution over belief states. The meta-dynamic over belief states thus determines both the transient and asymptotic work-extraction rate. In particular, the stationary distribution over recurrent belief states allows closed-form expressions for the asymptotic work-extraction rate.\nBoth the belief states and transitions between them derive from the HMM of the known source.\n1Except at the first step, where we use some \u03c1\u2217 \u0338= \u03be0, to avoid an unstable fixed point in the knowledge update.\n1\nBelief states can thus be explicitly represented in the memory M of an autonomous workharvesting device. The memory states {(\u03b7, \u03b5)}\u03b7,\u03b5 should also store the last measured energy state \u03b5 of the battery. A memory-controlled unitary can implement memory-assisted quantum work extraction, as depicted in the circuit diagram of Fig. 2. Subsequent measurement of the battery state then gives access to the work extracted and allows an autonomous update of the memory, according to the above-outlined rules of Bayesian prediction. This prediction\u2013extraction cycle continues repeatedly, as suggested in Fig. 3.\nIn short, at every time step, the engine performs both prediction and work-extraction subroutines. The prediction subroutine updates the belief state stored in M via pre-programmed transition rules conditioned on the energy state of B. Each unique \u03b7t\u2014up to the desired memory resolution\u2014corresponds to a subset of distinguishable states in the memory. The engine\u2019s work-extraction subroutine is conditioned on the memory M and acts on At with a quantum workextraction protocol tailored to extract work from\n\u03bet."

In these examples, the ideal input \u03c1\u2217t is a qubit density matrix with eigenvalues \u03bb (\u03c1\u2217t ) \u00b1 , where \u03bb (\u03c1\u2217t ) + \u2265 \u03bb (\u03c1\u2217t ) \u2212 \u2265 0. Due to Eqs. (5) and (6), we thus expect to observe one of two possible work values, w(\u00b1) from each distinct belief state.\nApproaches (i)-(iii) share some nice features. From Eq. (6), assuming distinct work values w(+) \u0338= w(\u2212), we find that the probability of observing each possible work value is simply given by the corresponding eigenvalue of the optimal input:\nPr(Wt+1 = w(\u00b1)|Kt = \u03b7t) = \u03bb (\u03c1\u2217t ) \u00b1 . (11)\nCombining this with Eq. (5), we find that the\nrate of work extraction can be expressed as\n\u27e8Wt\u27e9 = kBT \u27e8D[\u03c1\u2217t \u2225\u03b3]\u27e9Pr(Kt) (12)\nfor approaches (i)-(iii)\u2014although, notably, both \u03c1\u2217t and the set of belief states will be different in each approach\u2014with \u03c1\u2217t = \u03bet, \u03bedect , and \u03be0, respectively. The non-negativity of relative entropy thus guarantees the non-negativity of expected work extraction from these three approaches. Note that Eq. (12) is more general than Eq. (10) and allows us to compare workextraction performance of the three approaches.\nWithout any memory, the extractable structure is limited to the time-averaged statistical bias of the output [21], which explains why memoryless work extraction varies with r but not p. Further details of the analytic solution for expected work extraction can be found in Appendix H.\nOur numerical simulations use the quantum work-extraction protocol of Ref. [13] at each time-step, and agree very well with our more general analytical predictions. Indeed, the quantum work-extraction protocol of Ref. [13] provides an example of a \u03c1\u2217-ideal work-extraction protocol, in the limit of many bath interactions. More details can be found in Appendices F and G.\nIt is tempting to commit to the most likely outcome. However, the overcommitment approach (iv) performs the worst, since any reset operation (to \u03b3 in this case) with minimal entropy production for a pure-state input leads to infinite heat dissipation when operating on any other input [31, 32]. This translates to infinite negative work extraction \u27e8Wt\u27e9 = \u2212\u221e in this case of \u03c1\u2217t \u2208 {|0\u27e9\u27e80| , |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|}. This divergence can alternatively be seen from Eq. (5) as w(\u2212) \u223c ln\u03bb\u2212 \u2192 ln 0 = \u2212\u221e. In our numerical simulations, following Ref. [13], this minimal eigenvalue \u03bb\u2212 is inversely proportional to the number N of bath interactions, so that the overcommitment work penalty diverges as \u2212kBT (1\u2212 r) min(p, 1\u2212 p) lnN ."

            "text": "Surprisingly, there exists a blue inner region of panel 4(a) where the memoryless quantum approach (iii) achieves the same performance as our memory-assisted quantum approach (i). There exists a sharp phase boundary within which the use of memory does not boost performance. As seen clearly in panels 4(c) and 4(d), the phase boundary exhibits a discontinuity in the first derivative of work extraction with respect to process parametrization. This phase boundary is not unique to the perturbed-coin process and, indeed, also occurs in the 2-1 golden-mean process.\nSuch phase transitions originate from bifurcations of the attractors of the belief-state update maps. This is illustrated in Table 1, which shows the nonlinear return maps along with the consequences for belief dynamics and workextraction dynamics. We focus for now on the first two rows of Table 1, which illustrate the nonlinear dynamics of our memory-assisted quantum approach (i), in the memory-apathetic and memory-advantageous regimes, before and after bifurcation respectively.\nRecall from Fig. 1(a) that a two-state machine generates the perturbed-coin process. Hence, a\nscalar \u03f5t \u2208 [\u221212 , 1 2 ] suffices to describe the timedependent belief state \u03b7t = (12 + \u03f5t, 1 2 \u2212 \u03f5t). The magnitude of this scalar \u03f5t indicates the strength of evidence that the process is in a particular hidden state.\nThe first column of Table 1 shows the return maps for \u03f5t 7\u2192 \u03f5t+1 induced by either w(+) (red solid graph) or w(\u2212) (blue dashed graph), when the work-extraction protocol is optimized for \u03c1\u2217t = \u03bet (for the first two rows) or \u03c1\u2217t = \u03bedect (for the last row). To aid the visual bifurcation and stability analysis, we include a dotted diagonal line with slope one\u2014representing the identity map\u2014and a dotted diagonal line with slope minus one\u2014representing the swap map.\nIntersections between a return map and the dotted identity line would indicate a fixed point of the map upon its repeated application. If the magnitude of the slope at the intersection is less than unity, then it is a stable fixed point; if the magnitude of the slope at the intersection is greater than unity, then it is an unstable fixed point. Within the memory-apathetic region of parameter space, Work extraction does not supply enough evidence to nudge an observer out of a state of complete ignorance. In this regime, memory does not enhance quantum work extraction.\nAt the phase boundary in the process\u2019 parameter space, the fixed point at \u03c0 becomes unstable, and new attractors emerge for each map. However, the coexistence of the maps introduces competition between the attractors, as the maps are selected stochastically with probabilities \u03bb\u00b1. The two maps (red solid and blue dashed) interact to induce a steady-state metadynamic over recurrent belief states, shown as a Markov process in each row of Table 1\u2019s last column. In this memory-advantageous region, work extraction supplies sufficient evidence to inform an observer about the hidden state of the process, which in turn avails more extractable work.\nThe elegance of memory-assisted quantum work extraction is reflected in the simple one and two state recurrent memory structures. In comparison, the classical extractor not only harvests less work, but requires more memory to achieve its relatively meager returns. Note the infinite number of recurrent memory states in the classical-processing case, in the last row of Table 1."

            "text": "Has our engine performed optimally? To answer this requires some benchmark of optimality. Fortunately, this benchmark is furnished by an appropriate application of the thermodynamic second law.\nIf we treat the engine\u2019s memory and the multipartite quantum pattern as a single joint system, we can apply the second law of thermodynamics to (i) bound the maximal possible work extraction, and (ii) discover an initial thermodynamic investment required for the engine to become correlated with the pattern. The transient work investment is apparent in the \u2018work series\u2019 column of Table 1. It is a necessary price to harvest work at the optimal steady-state rate.\nLet us denote the joint state of a dMdimensional memory and the length-L pattern as \u03c1 (M,1:L) t , with corresponding reduced states of the memory \u03c1 (M) t and of the pattern \u03c1 (1:L) t . We will assume that the memory is fully energetically degenerate so that unitary memory updates do not cost energy. Then \u03b3 = (I/dM) \u2297 \u03b3\u2297L describes the equilibrium state of the joint su-\npersystem. If we denote W extt = \u2211t\n\u2113=1W\u2113 as the net work extracted up to time t, then the second law of thermodynamics tells us that the reduction in nonequilibrium free energy F (M,1:L)t upper bounds the expectation value of extracted work [10]:\n\u27e8W extt \u27e9 \u2264 F (M,1:L) 0 \u2212F (M,1:L) t . (13)\nSince the equilibrium free energy is unchanged during our work-extraction process, the change in nonequilibrium free energy is proportional to the change in relative entropy between \u03c1 (M,1:L) t and \u03b3. This relative entropy simplifies further when we invoke several features of our framework: Since the memory is always initialized as \u03c1 (M) 0 , the memory and pattern are initially uncorrelated: \u03c1 (M,1:L) 0 = \u03c1 (M) 0 \u2297 \u03c1 (1:L) 0 . Through the sequence of deterministic updates, the entropy of the memory is unchanging. Altogether, these features imply that the extractable work is upper bounded by\n\u27e8W extt \u27e9 kBT \u2264 D[\u03c1(1:L)0 \u2225\u03b3\u2297L]\u2212D[\u03c1 (1:L) t \u2225\u03b3\u2297L]\u2212 It ,\n(14)\nwhere It = D[\u03c1(M,1:L)t \u2225\u03c1 (M) t \u2297 \u03c1 (1:L) t ] is the mutual information that has built up between the memory and the quantum pattern.\nInvoking two more features leads us to a more interpretable version of this result. We note that after t time-steps, the first t subsystems of the pattern have been brought to their equilibrium states, while the other subsystems remain unaltered: \u03c1 (1:L) t = \u03b3\u2297t \u2297 \u03c1 (t+1:L) 0 . Let S(\u03c1) = \u2212Tr(\u03c1 ln \u03c1) denote the von Neumann entropy of \u03c1. If the engine operates on a very long quantum pattern with a von Neumann entropy rate svN := limL\u2192\u221e 1LS(\u03c1 (1:L) 0 ), we find that the steady-state work-extraction rate is upper bounded by\n\u27e8Wt\u27e9 kBT \u2264 S(\u03c1(\u2113)0 )\u2212 svN + D[\u03c1 (\u2113) 0 \u2225\u03b3] =: wideal kBT ,\n(15)\nwhere the choice of \u2113 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , L} is arbitrary since we assume a stationary quantum pattern. This is a special case of the Quantum Information Processing Second Law (QIPSL), derived as Eq. (77) in Appendix I.\nWhenever the input pattern is far from being fully consumed, we find that \u27e8W extt \u27e9 \u2264 twideal \u2212 kBT It. By the information-processing inequality, the investment cost It is no more than the quantum excess entropy E = lim\u2113\u2192\u221e I(\u03c1 (1:\u2113) 0 ; \u03c1 (\u2113+1:2\u2113) 0 ), which is the quantum mutual information between the sequences of past and future inputs. However, the engine will only be able to harvest work at the ideal steady-state rate if the memory stores all of the information from past inputs relevant for predicting future inputs, such that It = E . Only then will the process be seen at the true entropy rate svN; otherwise it will appear more random than it really is, with the hidden structure evading extraction.\nOn the other hand, when the entire pattern has been consumed, IL = 0 yet\n\u27e8W extL \u27e9 \u2264 Lwideal \u2212 kBTE . (16)\nThe quantum excess entropy E is a thermodynamic investment for any ideal extractor\u2014even one that operates non-locally. However, for local extractors, this investment must be payed upfront as It.\nIn the current framework, it remains an open question whether the knowledge about future inputs It attains the fundamental limit of what is knowable E , and whether the work extraction rate \u27e8Wt\u27e9 attains wideal. Perhaps quantum discord prevents local extractors from performing\noptimally unless they are equipped with quantum memory. Unfortunately, there is no known closed-form solution for the von Neumann entropy rate svN, even for the simple latent-state models studied here; Accordingly, we cannot analytically evaluate how close our engine is to optimal. Future studies could elucidate the path to optimality, by investigating the work-extraction rate as the agent (a) operates on longer subsequences or (b) explores non-greedy harvesting strategies."

However, in the steady state, the work-conditioned maps are unitary for our memory-assisted quantum approach (i). This can be seen in the first two rows of the last column of Table 1: For the perturbed-coin process, the work-induced map is either the identity or swap map on the restriction to the recurrent belief states. These asymptotic memory-update maps are unitary and so can be performed with zero dissipation.2\nFurther investigation is required to determine if the steady-state work-conditioned maps of our approach are always asymptotically unitary for other processes. If not, it may be beneficial to merge the work-extraction and prediction subroutines into a single more sophisticated asymptotically-unitary transformation. We anticipate that the memory updates would then be energetically free in the steady state. This expectation aligns with previous related studies on local work-harvesting pattern extractors in the classical domain, where the ideal pattern extractor\u2014which must be predictive of its input\u2014can update its memory for zero energy cost during steady state work extraction [33, 16, 34, 35].\n2In contrast, for the classical extractor, the nonunitarity of the steady-state map induced by w(\u2212) seems to reflect the loss of free energy upon decoherence in the energy basis."

            "text": "We developed the theoretical prototype for a quantum pattern engine: a machine that can adaptively extract useful work from quantum stochastic processes by exploiting knowledge of the temporal patterns they contain. We witnessed that, in the presence of coherence, the memory-assisted quantum approach will always outperform the memory-assisted classical approach. We also demonstrated its advantage over engines that can only harness static quantum resources\u2014although, surprisingly, we found a phase transition marking the onset of memory advantage. It is an open question whether this phase transition coincides with the onset of quantum discord.\nIn Thm. 1, we found how to update the state of knowledge about any latent-state generator of a quantum process, given any POVM on the current quantum output. In Thm. 2, we found the exact work distribution obtained from any \u03c1\u2217ideal work-extraction protocol operating on any quantum state. This enabled belief-state updates via observed values of work extraction. Sec. 5 developed the fundamental thermodynamic limits of work extraction from correlated multi-partite quantum systems, which sets the ultimate benchmark for our approach or any alternative.\nDespite the advances presented here, many open questions remain for future work.\nIt is known that measurements themselves can cost some resource, energetic or otherwise [36, 37]. Careful accounting of the resources required for (perfect or imperfect) measurement in our framework would provide a fuller picture of our engine\u2019s performance. Alternatively, it may be possible to use a quantum memory and fully unitary evolution (rather than projective measurements on the battery and subsequent conditional operations on the memory), which would avoid this issue completely.\nAlthough designing the protocol for the observation-induced expected state, \u03c1\u2217t = \u03bet, guarantees maximal work extraction locally in time, it remains an interesting open question whether there is a superior steady-state approach that sacrifices short-term work extraction for greater knowledge and long-term returns.\nIt may be possible to extend our method to more complex quantum processes, e.g., to those with entangled temporal correlations. This\nwould, however, likely require a quantum memory. On the other hand, our method can immediately be adapted to applications where the pattern is spatial instead of temporal (e.g., states of many-body systems), and where the engine is constrained to operate locally on small regions at a time."

Each of these factors contributes uniquely to the free energy. When operating sequentially on each subsystem, quantum pattern engines must leverage past information to harvest the free energy in the correlations.\nIn the main text, we suppose each non-interacting subsystem has the same local Hamiltonian, which implies that the reference Gibbs states are also all the same: \u03b3(\u2113) = \u03b3. The general decomposition here shows that both quantum and classical correlations contribute to the extractable nonequilium addition to free energy. However, in the main text, the quantum pattern is assumed to be classically-generated, despite having non-orthogonal states. The inter-time quantum correlations are thus restricted to quantum discord, with no inter-time entanglement [24]."

The optimal state of knowledge, given a sequence of observations o1o2 . . . ot obtained via interventions on the sequence of quantum systems \u03c3(x1), \u03c3(x2), . . . \u03c3(xt) is the conditional probability distribution induced by these interventions,\n\u03b7t := Pr(St|O1 . . . Ot = o1 . . . ot, S0 \u223c \u03c0) . (25)\nThe last condition S0 \u223c \u03c0 means that the initial latent state of the generator is distributed as \u03c0. This can be rewritten as \u03b7t = \u2211 s \u03c0(s) Pr(St|O1 . . . Ot = o1 . . . ot, S0 = s) for t > 0. Recall that\n\u03c0 = \u03c0 \u2211\nx\u2208X T (x) is the stationary distribution over the states of the generator. Thus, \u03b70 = \u03c0.\nIf we introduce a new random variable Kt to denote the optimally updated state of knowledge about the latent state of the pattern generator, then we can replace the condition St\u22121 \u223c \u03b7t\u22121 with Kt\u22121 = \u03b7t\u22121. The condition on the state of knowledge is relevant to the extent that the choice of POVM is influenced by the state of knowledge. We remind the reader that in our framework the POVM on the current quantum output is chosen as a function of the state of knowledge Kt.\nNote that the current quantum output only depends on the current latent state of the process. Accordingly, the next observation\u2014which is the outcome of the POVM on the current quantum output\u2014is conditionally independent of all previous outputs, given the current latent state and given the state of knowledge induced by all previous outputs.\nWe will now show that the optimal state of knowledge is recursive.

(31)\nHence, we have obtained Eq. (26) from Eq. (25) as promised.\nFurther manipulations, using the rules of probability and the conditional independencies indicated in the Bayesian network depicted in Fig. 5, allow us to express the optimal state of knowledge in terms of both conditional work distributions and simple linear algebraic manipulations of the generative HMM representing the memoryful source.

(37)\nC.1 Using this to build a predictive work-extraction engine\nRather than repeatedly calculating these ideal belief states on the fly for a specific realization of the process, we can alternatively systematically build up the set of all such belief states, together with the observation-induced transitions among them, to inform the design of an autonomous engine. There will be both a set of transient belief states and a set of recurrent belief states. Both of these sets may be either finite or infinite. In the case that only finitely many belief states are induced by observations, we can explicitly build out the transition structure among them. If there are infinitely many such states, then we would need to truncate unlikely states in the design of our finite physical engine [28].\nThe physical memory system of our proposed engine should have at least one distinguishable state corresponding to every observation-induced belief state. In fact, the memory must encode both the belief state and the most recent energy of the battery, so that conditioning on the new state of the battery is sufficient to supply the change in battery energy. These will likely be encoded with some finite precision, to avoid storing real numbers. Conditioned on the state of the memory encoding \u03b7, the work extraction protocol will operate jointly on the quantum system, thermal reservoirs, and battery, to optimally extract work from the expected state \u03be = \u2211 x\u2208X \u03b7T\n(x)1\u03c3(x). The subsequently observed work value w uniquely updates the memory from the state encoding \u03b7\nto the state encoding \u03b7\u2032 = \u2211 x\u2208X Pr(Wt=w|Xt=x,St\u22121\u223c\u03b7)\u03b7T (x)\u2211\nx\u2032\u2208X Pr(Wt=w|Xt=x \u2032,St\u22121\u223c\u03b7)\u03b7T (x\u2032)1\n.

            "text": "Work extraction in the limit of zero entropy production is important since it extracts all extractable work from a quantum state. It thus indicates the best possible scenario, against which other efforts can be compared.\nIn the limit of zero-entropy-production work extraction from \u03c1\u2217, the net unitary time evolution of the system\u2013battery\u2013baths supersystem must take a special form. In particular, the state of the battery will change deterministically when the initial state of the system is an eigenstate |\u03bbn\u27e9 of \u03c1\u2217 = \u2211 n \u03bbn |\u03bbn\u27e9 \u27e8\u03bbn|, almost-surely independent of the initial realization of the reservoirs. This implies that the net unitary time evolution will be of the form\nU = \u2211 \u03b5,n,r ( |\u03b5+ w(n)\u27e9 \u2297 |f\u03b5(n, r)\u27e9 )( \u27e8\u03b5| \u2297 \u27e8\u03bbn| \u2297 \u27e8r| ) (38)\nfor some w(n) \u2208 R. Above, |\u03b5\u27e9 and |\u03b5+ w(n)\u27e9 are energy eigenstates of the work reservoir, while |r\u27e9 is an energy eigenstate of the thermal baths. It will be useful in the following to note that \u27e8f\u03b5(n, r)|f\u03b5(n\u2032, r\u2032)\u27e9 = \u03b4n,n\u2032\u03b4r,r\u2032 since unitary operations map orthogonal states to orthogonal states\nThe form of the unitary Eq. (38) effectively assumes that the energy of the battery is well above its ground state. Some interesting nuances have recently been explored for batteries close to their ground state (see, e.g., Ref. [38]), which would affect the statistics of the work-extraction values, but we avoid that regime here to instead focus on the best-possible scenario.\nOne way to determine w(n) is via the initial-state dependence of entropy production. Let \u27e8\u03a3\u27e9\u03c1 denote the expectation value for entropy production, given initial system-state \u03c1, under the fixed work-extraction protocol optimized for \u03c1\u2217. In our case with a single heat bath at temperature T , the expected entropy production can be defined as usual as \u27e8\u03a3\u27e9\u03c1 = ( \u27e8W\u0303 \u27e9\u03c1 \u2212\u2206Ft ) /T . This is the entropy production for a fixed protocol operating on the initial state \u03c1, where Ft is the nonequilibrium free energy at time t, while \u2206Ft is the change in nonequilibrium free energy over the course of the protocol, and W\u0303 is the work exerted, which is just the negative of the extractable work [10]. Since all initial states map to \u03b3 by the end of the work-extraction protocol, we know from Ref. [31] that\n\u27e8\u03a3\u27e9\u03c3 \u2212 \u27e8\u03a3\u27e9\u03c1\u2217 = kBD[\u03c3\u2225\u03c1 \u2217] . (39)\nIn this case, \u27e8\u03a3\u27e9\u03c1\u2217 = 0 and T \u27e8\u03a3\u27e9\u03c3 = \u27e8W\u0303 \u27e9\u03c3 \u2212\u2206Ft = \u27e8W\u0303 \u27e9\u03c3 + kBTD[\u03c3\u2225\u03b3]. Hence, with \u03b2 = (kBT )\u22121,\n\u03b2 \u27e8W\u0303 \u27e9\u03c3 = D[\u03c3\u2225\u03c1 \u2217]\u2212D[\u03c3\u2225\u03b3] (40)\n= Tr(\u03c3 ln \u03b3)\u2212 Tr(\u03c3 ln \u03c1\u2217) . (41)\nIn particular, let \u03c3 = |\u03bbn\u27e9 \u27e8\u03bbn|, and note that ln \u03b3 = ln(e\u2212\u03b2H/Z) = \u03b2(F\u2212H). This yields \u27e8W\u0303 \u27e9|\u03bbn\u27e9\u27e8\u03bbn| = F\u2212\u27e8\u03bbn|H|\u03bbn\u27e9\u2212kBT ln\u03bbn.

            "text": "It is a familiar concept in the design of any engine: that maximal thermodynamic efficiency requires sufficiently slow operation. Clearly, this has implications for the power output of the engine [39, 40]. However, the relaxation timescales of an engine depend on particular material properties of the system and baths, as well as the particular interaction Hamiltonian, so there is no implementation-independent timescale that determines the practical operation speed of an engine.\nNevertheless, we can apply rather general principles to assess how power typically scales with increasingly fast operation. For example, under assumptions of a Lindblad master equation, there will be a contribution to entropy production (and a corresponding decrease in extracted work per operation) that scales as 1/\u03c40, where \u03c40 is the duration of the work-extraction protocol [41]. Or, for unitary interactions with the bath, a similar statement can be made but with \u03c40 proportional to the number of interactions with bath degrees of freedom (i.e., the \u2018circuit complexity\u2019) [42]. In either case, we expect entropy production to scale as \u03a3 \u2248 c/(\u03ba + \u03c40) \u2248 c/\u03c40 for \u03c40 \u226b \u03ba > 0 where c and \u03ba are implementation-dependent positive quantities.\nIn a fixed time \u03c4 , the number of work-extraction operations t determines the maximal allowed time \u03c4/t \u2265 \u03c40 for each work-extraction protocol. Let \u27e8Wext\u27e9 be the steady-state work-extraction rate per operation in the limit of very slow operation (i.e., in the limit of infinitely many relaxation steps per work-extraction operation). The power P achieved by finite-time operation is then sandwiched by\nt \u03c4 \u27e8Wext\u27e9 \u2265 P = t \u03c4 ( \u27e8Wext\u27e9 \u2212 cT/\u03c40 ) \u2265 t\u03c4 \u27e8Wext\u27e9 \u2212 cT/\u03c4 2 0 . (50)\nWe focus on the regime where each work-extraction protocol is of sufficiently long duration \u03c40 \u226b c/kB, such that cT/\u03c40 is negligible. In this regime, the power trivially scales with the number of\noperations per second, P = t\u03c4 \u27e8Wext\u27e9 \u221d t/\u03c4 . In the main text, we focus on results about \u27e8Wext\u27e9 obtained in this simple regime, since it highlights the thermodynamic role of correlations and quantum discord.\nF The work extraction protocol of Skrzypczyk et al. For self containment, here we give a brief summary of the Skrzypczyk et al. work-extraction protocol [13], utilized in our numerical simulations. Ref. [13] should be consulted for further details.\nThe work extraction protocol of Ref. [13], proceeds in two stages. The first stage (isentropically) puts the system into a mixture of energy eigenstates, using the battery to offset internal energy changes. In the second stage, the system is coupled with the ambient heat bath to slowly (in a sequence of N steps) relax it into a thermal state, again using the battery to absorb all energy offsets. Consider a system and a weight initially in an uncoupled state \u03c1\u2217\u2297 \u03c1w. Let \u03c1\u2217 = \u2211 n \u03bbn |\u03bbn\u27e9 \u27e8\u03bbn| be a spectral decomposition of the system state \u03c1\u2217, with \u03bbn \u2265 \u03bbn+1. Step 1 of the work extraction protocol maps the eigenvectors |\u03bbn\u27e9 into the energy eigenstates of the system, via the unitary operator\nV = \u2211\nn\n|En\u27e9 \u27e8\u03bbn| \u2297 \u0393hn , (51)\nwhere hn = \u27e8\u03bbn|Hs |\u03bbn\u27e9 \u2212 En accounts for the difference in energy in the two states and \u0393 is an operator to raise the potential energy of the weight. V therefore conserves energy on average. The resultant state will be\n\u03c1SW = \u2211\nn\n\u03bbn |En\u27e9 \u27e8En| \u2297 \u0393hn\u03c1w\u0393 \u2020 hn\n(52)\nIn Step 2, the resultant state \u03c1SW will go through a sequence of transformation to reach the Gibbs state, \u03b3 = \u2211 n e \u2212\u03b2En/Z |En\u27e9 \u27e8En|. At each sub-step of the transformation, the relative probabilities of two levels will be adjusted by \u03b4p towards the Gibbs distribution over energy eigenstates. Suppose we now focus on the occupation probability of the ground state and first excited state, |E0\u27e9 and |E1\u27e9. In the first sub-step of thermalization, the system will interact with a bath qubit, \u03c1B = q0q0+q1 |0\u27e9 \u27e80| +\nq1 q0+q1 |1\u27e9 \u27e81|, where q0 = \u03bb0 \u2212 \u03b4p and q1 = \u03bb1 + \u03b4p. A unitary transformation is then used to swap the occupation statistics of the bath qubit and the system qubit; in doing so, the battery\u2019s energy level rises or drops to conserve the total energy. The transformation can be described as\n|E0\u27e9S |1\u27e9B |x\u27e9W \u2190\u2192 |E1\u27e9S |0\u27e9B |x+ h\u27e9W (53)\nwhere h = kBT log q0q1 \u2212 (E1 \u2212 E0). The process then repeats itself by varying the value of q0 and q1 until \u03c1SW reaches a Gibbs state. It is provable that this protocol is able to extract all the free energy of the system up to O(\u03b4p2)."

One can refer to Fig. 6 to see that as N \u2192 \u221e the protocol indeed extracts all the free energy from the system. After the extraction, the change in the battery system is measured and recorded. As mentioned in a previous section, if N \u2192 \u221e, the work distribution will converge to a set of \u03b4-functions. If N is finite, the probability distribution of the work measured becomes more diffuse, as shown in Fig. 7. The state of knowledge is updated via Bayesian inference, conditioned on the observed work value. This inference step is\nnotably absent from the memoryless approach, where the state of knowledge effectively remains at the initial state of ignorance \u03b7t = \u03c0.\nFor the classical protocol, we assume that energetic coherences are inaccessible. In this case, our simulations utilize the Skrzypczyk work-extraction protocol tailored to the decohered state \u03c1\u2217t = \u03bedect . However, initial decoherence in any other basis, besides \u03bet\u2019s eigenbasis, would likewise underperform compared to the memory-assisted quantum protocol.\nThe overcommitment protocol differs from the rest as it tailors the extraction protocol for the state with the highest probability of emission. The probability of emission can be calculated from the state of knowledge \u03b7tT\n(x)1. The graphs in Panels (c) and (d) of Fig 4 display only positive work-extraction values on the vertical axis; hence most of the data points for overcommitment are not shown owing to its bad performance."

We derive these expressions for the (p, r)-parametrized family of perturbed-coin processes of classically correlated quantum states discussed in the main text.\nRecall that the quantum states (\u03c3(x))x\u2208X are the outputs of a Mealy HMM with labeled transition matrices (T (x))x\u2208X . An element of the labeled transition matrix T (x)s\u2192s\u2032 = Pr(Xt = x, St = s\u2032|St\u22121 = s) gives the joint probability of producing quantum state \u03c3(x) and arriving at latent state s\u2032, given that the HMM begins in state s.\nFor the perturbed-coin example, the HMM\u2019s labeled transition matrices are\nT (0) = [ 1\u2212 p 0 p 0 ] and T (1) = [ 0 p 0 1\u2212 p ] .

(57)\nRecall that the eigenvalues and eigenstates of \u03c1\u2217t play a prominent role in the work-extraction statistics. We find that the eigenvalues of \u03c1(\u03f5) are\n\u03bb (\u03c1(\u03f5)) \u00b1 = 12 \u00b1 1 2\n\u221a r + \u03f5\u20322 , (58)\nwith corresponding eigenstates\n|\u03bb(\u03c1 (\u03f5)) \u00b1 \u27e9 = 2\u22121/2 [ r + \u03f5\u20322 \u2213 ( r + \u03f5\u2032 \u221a 1\u2212 r )\u221a r + \u03f5\u20322 ]\u22121/2 [ \u221ar(1\u2212 r)\u2212 \u03f5\u2032\u221ar \u2212r \u2212 \u03f5\u2032 \u221a 1\u2212 r \u00b1 \u221a r + \u03f5\u20322 ] . (59)\nFor all times after t = 0, the update rule for belief states simplifies to the following\n\u03b7t+1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 Wt+1=w(\u00b1) = \u2211 x\u2208X \u27e8\u03bb (\u03bet) \u00b1 |\u03c3(x) |\u03bb (\u03bet) \u00b1 \u27e9 \u03b7tT (x)\n\u03bb (\u03bet) \u00b1\n, (60)\nwhich can be expressed explicitly in terms of p, r, and \u03f5t. When \u03f5t = 0, we find that \u03b7t+1 = [ 1 2 , 1 2 ] = \u03c0. I.e., the stationary distribution is a fixed point for this dynamic over belief states. Because of this, we break the initial symmetry by setting \u03f5 to a small non-zero value to obtain useful knowledge. In other words, for the very first work-extraction protocol, we choose some \u03c1\u22170 \u0338= \u03be0 to avoid an unstable fixed point of the update rule. However, for all subsequent time steps, we choose \u03c1\u2217t = \u03bet.\nFor the perturbed coin, the metadynamic of the belief state in the long run will yield two different results, depending on which regime the system is in, \u201cmemory-apathetic regime\u201d or \u201cmemoryadvantageous regime\u201d. The reason for this separation comes from the shape of their update function. For the memory-apathetic region, the update function has gradient less than unity, making \u03f5 = 0 an attractor. For the memory-advantageous region, the gradient of the update function exceeds unity, therefore making \u03f5 = 0 a repellor, at the same time two other points become part of a new attractor.\nIn the long run, transient belief states die out, leaving only the steady-state dynamics among the recurrent states of knowledge; any initial distribution over belief states generically converges to the stationary measure \u03c0K. Hence the steady-state rate of work extraction is given by\nlim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8Wt\u27e9 = kBT \u27e8D[\u03bet\u2225\u03b3]\u27e9Pr(Kt)=\u03c0K , (61)\nThe expected extracted work for the memory-apathetic region coincide with that of memoryless extraction and is given by \u2329\nW apathetic \u232a = kBTD[\u03be0\u2225\u03b3] = \u2329 Wmemoryless \u232a . (62)\nOn the other hand, in the regime where memory enhances the performance of the protocol, the stationary distribution over the two recurrent belief states \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032, with corresponding expected quantum states \u03be and \u03be\u2032, is\n\u03c0K = 1\n\u03bb (\u03be) + + \u03bb (\u03be\u2032) +\n[\u03bb(\u03be \u2032) + , \u03bb (\u03be) + ] . (63)\nHence, the work extraction rate is given by\u2329 W advantage \u232a = kBT \u03bb (\u03be) + + \u03bb (\u03be\u2032) + ( \u03bb (\u03be\u2032) + D[\u03be\u2225\u03b3] + \u03bb (\u03be) + D[\u03be\u2032\u2225\u03b3] ) . (64)\nH.2 Classical approach\nThe derivation for the memory-assisted classical approach is similar to that of the memory-assisted quantum approach illustrated above. However rather than operating on the induced expected state \u03bet, the classical approach uses work-extraction protocols that are thermodynamically optimized for the decohered state\n\u03c1\u2217t = \u03bedect = 1 2\n[ 1 + r + \u03f5\u2032t \u221a 1\u2212 r 0\n0 1\u2212 r \u2212 \u03f5\u2032t \u221a 1\u2212 r\n] . (65)\nThe eigenstates of \u03c1\u2217t are thus |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9, independent of time in this case. In the classical approach, \u03c0 is no longer a fixed point of the belief-state update maps. The transition probabilities between belief states are now given by\n\u03bb (\u03bedect ) \u00b1 = 12\n[ 1\u00b1 ( r + \u03f5\u2032t \u221a 1\u2212 r )] . (66)\nThe metadynamic of belief in the classical case behaves as a reset processes. Unlike the quantum case with only two recurrent belief states, the classical protocol induces an infinite set of recurrent belief states. To construct a finite-state autonomous engine, we could choose to truncate those states within some small \u03b4 distance from another recurrent state, or truncate belief states with negligible probability, with vanishing work-extraction penalty.\nWe find that the work-extraction rate can again be computed by averaging the relative entropy\u2014now between the decohered expected state and thermal state\u2014over all recurrent states of knowledge:\n\u27e8W classicalt \u27e9 = kBT \u27e8D[\u03bedect \u2225\u03b3]\u27e9Pr(Kclassicalt ) . (67)\nH.3 Overcommitment to the most likely outcome The \u201covercommitment\u201d approach used for comparison in the main text bets exclusively on the most likely outcome in {\u03c3(x)}x.\nThe expected thermodynamic cost of misaligned expectations during work extraction can be quantified exactly via the relative entropy D[\u03c10\u2225\u03b10] between the actual input \u03c10 and the anticipated input \u03b10 that the protocol is optimal for, if we assume that the final state is independent of the initial state [31, 32]. Hence, if we design the protocol for a pure state, but operate on a mixed state, we will encounter divergent thermodynamic penalties.\nAccordingly, we can observe divergent thermodynamic costs when we design the Skrzypczyk work extraction protocol to be optimal for operation on a pure state.\nUsing the Skrzypczyk protocol (with N relaxation steps) to extract work from the pure state bet upon, we see that the first bath state swapped with the system for energy extraction is not exactly\npure, but rather satisfies \u03b3B = ( 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b2E0\nN(e\u2212\u03b2E0 +e\u2212\u03b2E1 )\n) |0\u27e9 \u27e80|+ e\u2212\u03b2E1\nN(e\u2212\u03b2E0 +e\u2212\u03b2E1 ) |1\u27e9 \u27e81|. (Recall that H is the Hamiltonian for the system, not of the bath.) Any purity of the actual input beyond this initial bath purity is wasted. The input state leading to minimal entropy production under this protocol is thus a unitary rotation of \u03b3B.\nThus, for this use case of the Skrzypczyk protocol, the minimally dissipative state \u03b10 becomes pure as N \u2192 \u221e. As N \u2192 \u221e, we observe the battery\u2019s final expected energy diverging (but only logarithmically in N) to negative infinity, when this protocol acts on any other state. I.e., \u27e8W \u27e9 \u223c \u2212kBT lnN .\nMore specifically, we can leverage Eqs. (5) and (6) to calculate the expected value of work for the overcommitment approach. We find that\nPr(W = w(\u2212)|\u03c3(argminx\u03b7tT (x)1)) = | \u27e81|\u03c8\u27e9 |2 = 1\u2212 r . (68)\nWith \u03bb\u2212 = e \u2212\u03b2E1 N(e\u2212\u03b2E0 +e\u2212\u03b2E1 ) , w (\u2212) \u223c \u2212kBT lnN , and minx\u03b7tT (x)1 \u223c min(p, 1 \u2212 p) when \u03b7t is close to either latent state, we anticipate that the overcommited work penalty diverges as \u2212kBT (1\u2212 r) min(p, 1\u2212 p) lnN , as observed.\nInterestingly, for a finite number of bath interactions, some work can be extracted on average within certain regimes. But other regions of parameter space would yield very negative work-extraction averages.\nUnlike the other approaches, the expectation value of work in the overcommitment approach cannot be written as a relative entropy. Hence, whereas the other approaches were guaranteed to have nonnegative work extraction on average, the overcommitment approach enjoys no such guarantee of nonnegativity. Indeed in the limit of many bath interactions, the overcommitment approach leads to infinitely negative work extraction."

[8, 43, 33, 44, 45, 35, 46] in several directions.\nWe consider the fundamental thermodynamic limits of a memoryful physical transducer that consumes one physical pattern and produces another. Both the input and output are assumed to be stationary quantum stochastic processes. Although much of the previous information-engines literature restricts itself to the energy-degenerate case (such that a \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 have the same energy), here we generalize to allow the Hamiltonian for each subsystem to be either degenerate or non-degenerate.\nDenote the joint state of a dM-dimensional memory and the length-L pattern as \u03c1 (M,1:L) t , with\ncorresponding reduced states of the memory \u03c1 (M) t and of the pattern \u03c1 (1:L) t . If we denote W ext \u03c4 =\u2211\u03c4\nt=1Wt as the net work extracted up to time \u03c4 , then the second law of thermodynamics tells us that the change in nonequilibrium free energy F (M,1:L)t upper bounds the expectation value of extracted work when the environment is at the fixed temperature T [10]. We assume cyclic transformations where the joint Hamiltonian at time \u03c4 is the same as the the joint Hamiltonian at time 0\u2014although it may be modulated during the protocol to enable the work extraction. The equilibrium state \u03b3 for the joint pattern and memory is thus the same at times 0 and \u03c4 . For this reason, there is no net change in equilibrium free energy. Accordingly, the only change in nonequilibrium free energy is due to the change in the nonequilbrium addition to free energy\u2014the quantum relative entropy between the actual state and the equilibrium state:\n\u27e8W ext\u03c4 \u27e9 \u2264 F (M,1:L) 0 \u2212F (M,1:L) \u03c4\n= kBTD[\u03c1(M,1:L)0 \u2225\u03b3]\u2212 kBTD[\u03c1(M,1:L)\u03c4 \u2225\u03b3] . (69)\nWe now make several assumptions relevant to energetically-efficient memoryful pattern manipulation:\n1. We will assume that the memory is fully energetically degenerate so that unitary memory updates do not cost energy. Then \u03b3 = (I/dM) \u2297 \u03b3\u2297L describes the equilibrium state of the joint supersystem.\n2. Since the memory is always initialized as a particular memory state \u03c1 (M) 0 , the memory and pattern\nare initially uncorrelated: \u03c1 (M,1:L) 0 = \u03c1 (M) 0 \u2297 \u03c1 (1:L) 0 .\n3. Through the sequence of deterministic updates, and equal (possibly zero) internal entropy of each memory state, the entropy of the memory is unchanging.\nAltogether, these features imply that the extractable work is upper bounded by\n\u27e8W ext\u03c4 \u27e9 kBT \u2264 D[\u03c1(1:L)0 \u2225\u03b3\u2297L]\u2212D[\u03c1(1:L)\u03c4 \u2225\u03b3\u2297L]\u2212 I\u03c4 (70)\n= \u2212I\u03c4 + \u2206S(\u03c1(1:L)t ) + \u2206 L\u2211\n\u2113=1 Tr(\u03c1(\u2113)t ln \u03b3) , (71)\nwhere It = D[\u03c1(M,1:L)t \u2225\u03c1 (M) t \u2297 \u03c1 (1:L) t ] is the mutual information that has built up between the memory and the quantum pattern. The operator \u2206 evaluates the difference of each function from time t = 0 to time t = \u03c4 , such that \u2206ft \u2261 f\u03c4 \u2212 f0 for any function f of t.\nThe classical IPSL, and the quantum generalization we derive, address the scenario where a physical machine scans unidirectionally along the pattern. After \u03c4 time-steps, the first \u03c4 subsystems of the pattern have interacted with the machine, while the other subsystems remain unaltered: \u03c1 (\u03c4+1:L) \u03c4 = \u03c1 (\u03c4+1:L) 0 . More specifically, the IPSL assumes that both the input tape and output tape are stationary stochastic processes, such that all marginal distributions of each (input or output) is shift invariant within the\ndomain of the existing pattern. We likewise consider the case that both input and output processes have a well-defined von Neumann entropy rate svN and s \u2032 vN respectively. Each also has a myopic entropy rate s\u2113 = S(\u03c1 (1:\u2113) 0 )\u2212 S(\u03c1 (1:\u2113\u22121) 0 ) and s\u2032\u2113 = S(\u03c1 (1:\u2113) \u03c4 )\u2212 S(\u03c1(1:\u2113\u22121)\u03c4 ) for \u2113 \u2264 \u03c4 , with s1 = S(\u03c1(1)0 ) and s\u20321 = S(\u03c1 (1) \u03c4 ). The myopic entropy rate describes the convergence to irreducible randomness in pattern extension, as progressively more subsystems are prefixed. Relatedly, the myopic excess entropy for the input process is E\u2113 = \u2211\u2113 n=1(sn \u2212 svN), with a similar relation for the primed output process. Asymptotically, the excess entropy describes the quantum mutual information between the past and future of a bi-infinite process: lim\u2113\u2192\u221e E\u2113 = E = lim\u2113\u2192\u221e I(\u03c1 (1:\u2113) 0 ; \u03c1 (\u2113+1:2\u2113) 0 ).\nWith these definitions and assumptions in place, we can now expand Eq. (71) to derive the QIPSL:\n\u27e8W ext\u03c4 \u27e9 kBT\n\u2264 \u2212I\u03c4 + \u2206S(\u03c1(1:L)t ) + \u2206 L\u2211\n\u2113=1 Tr(\u03c1(\u2113)t ln \u03b3)\n= \u2212I\u03c4 + \u2206S(\u03c1(1:L)t ) + \u2206 \u03c4\u2211\n\u2113=1 Tr(\u03c1(\u2113)t ln \u03b3) (72)\n= \u2212I\u03c4 + \u2206S(\u03c1(1:L)t ) + \u03c4\u2206Tr(\u03c1 (1) t ln \u03b3) . (73)\nNow, note that\n\u2206S(\u03c1(1:L)t ) = \u2206S(\u03c1 (1:\u03c4) t ) + \u2206S(\u03c1 (\u03c4+1:L) t )\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 =0 \u2212\u2206I(\u03c1(1:\u03c4)t ; \u03c1 (\u03c4+1:L) t ) (74)\n= \u2212I(\u03c1(1:\u03c4)\u03c4 ; \u03c1(\u03c4+1:L)\u03c4\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 =\u03c1(\u03c4+1:L)0 ) + \u2206S(\u03c1(1:\u03c4)t )\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u03c4(s\u2032vN\u2212svN)+E \u2032\u03c4\u2212E\u03c4 + S(\u03c1(1:\u03c4)0 ) + S(\u03c1 (\u03c4+1:L) 0 )\u2212 S(\u03c1 (1:L) 0 )\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 E\u03c4 +EL\u2212\u03c4\u2212EL\n(75)\n= \u2212I(\u03c1(1:\u03c4)\u03c4 ; \u03c1 (\u03c4+1:L) 0 ) + \u03c4(s\u2032vN \u2212 svN) + E \u2032\u03c4 \u2212 (EL \u2212 EL\u2212\u03c4 ) . (76)\nThus, plugging this back in to Eq. (73), we arrive at the Quantum Information Processing Second Law (QIPSL):\n\u27e8W ext\u03c4 \u27e9 kBT \u2264 \u2212I\u03c4 \u2212 I(\u03c1(1:\u03c4)\u03c4 ; \u03c1 (\u03c4+1:L) 0 ) + \u03c4(s\u2032vN \u2212 svN) + E \u2032\u03c4 \u2212 (EL \u2212 EL\u2212\u03c4 ) + \u03c4\u2206Tr(\u03c1 (1) t ln \u03b3) . (77)\nUnder typical assumptions like finite memory, the time-extensive rate of work extraction during sequential quantum pattern manipulation is thus upper bounded by s\u2032vN\u2212 svN + \u2206Tr(\u03c1 (1) t ln \u03b3), in units of kBT :\nlim \u03c4\u2192\u221e \u27e8W ext\u03c4 \u27e9 \u03c4kBT \u2264 s\u2032vN \u2212 svN + \u2206Tr(\u03c1 (1) t ln \u03b3) . (78)\nFurthermore, if the Hamiltonian of each subsystem is fully degenerate, then \u2206Tr(\u03c1(1)t ln \u03b3) = 0, which would yield lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e \u27e8W ext \u03c4 \u27e9\n\u03c4kBT \u2264 s\u2032vN\u2212 svN\u2014analogous to the typical statement of the classical IPSL, but\nwith von Neumann entropy density in place of the classical entropy density. To be thermodynamically efficient, it is known that the classical machine needs to be predictive or retrodictive in the case that it is consuming or generating a process, respectively [33, 16, 34, 35]. From Eq. (77), we now see that an analogous result remains true in the more general quantum case.\nIt is worth reflecting on the behavior of the contributions to Eq. (77). Notably, EL \u2212 EL\u2212\u03c4 \u2265 0, with EL \u2212 EL\u2212\u03c4 \u2248 0 when L \u2212 \u03c4 \u226b 0, and EL \u2212 EL\u2212\u03c4 \u2192 EL \u2248 E as \u03c4 \u2192 L. Meanwhile, the myopic excess entropy for the output process is a non-decreasing function of \u03c4 that approaches the past\u2013future quantum mutual information of the output process E \u2032\u03c4 \u2248 E \u2032 whenever \u03c4 \u226b 0.\nI.1 Implications for work extraction What are the implications for work extraction? We note that after t time-steps of work extraction from a quantum pattern, the first t subsystems of the pattern have been brought to their equilibrium states,\nwhile the other subsystems remain unaltered: \u03c1 (1:L) t = \u03b3\u2297t \u2297 \u03c1 (t+1:L) 0 . Hence I(\u03c1 (1:\u03c4) \u03c4 ; \u03c1(\u03c4+1:L)0 ) = 0, and I\u03c4 = D[\u03c1(M,\u03c4+1:L)\u03c4 \u2225\u03c1(M)\u03c4 \u2297 \u03c1(\u03c4+1:L)\u03c4 ] with I\u03c4 \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 L. Since the output process produces an IID sequence of Gibbs states, we have E \u2032t = 0, while the entropy rate of the output equals the entropy of the Gibbs state s\u2032vN = S(\u03b3).\nEq. (77) thus simplifies in this setting to become\n\u27e8W ext\u03c4 \u27e9 kBT \u2264 \u2212I\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4svN \u2212 (EL \u2212 EL\u2212\u03c4 )\u2212 \u03c4Tr(\u03c1(\u2113)0 ln \u03b3) (79)\n= \u2212I\u03c4 + \u03c4 [S(\u03c1(\u2113)0 )\u2212 svN]\u2212 (EL \u2212 EL\u2212\u03c4 ) + \u03c4D[\u03c1 (\u2113) 0 \u2225\u03b3] , (80)\nwhere the choice of \u2113 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , L} is arbitrary since we assume a stationary quantum pattern. For a long pattern, the asymptotic work-extraction rate is \u27e8Wt\u27e9 = lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e W ext \u03c4 \u03c4 . When the workextraction device has a finite memory, so that lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e I\u03c4\u03c4 = 0, we thus find that the steady-state work-extraction rate is upper bounded by\n\u27e8Wt\u27e9 kBT \u2264 S(\u03c1(\u2113)0 )\u2212 svN + D[\u03c1 (\u2113) 0 \u2225\u03b3] =: wideal kBT . (81)\nWhen there is still plenty of input pattern remaining\u2014i.e., when L\u2212 \u03c4 is sufficiently large such that EL \u2212 EL\u2212\u03c4 \u2248 0\u2014we find \u27e8W ext\u03c4 \u27e9 \u2264 \u03c4wideal \u2212 kBT I\u03c4 . On the other hand, when the entire pattern has been consumed, IL = 0 yet EL \u2212 E0 = EL \u2248 E for sufficiently large L, leading to\n\u27e8W extL \u27e9 \u2264 Lwideal \u2212 kBTE . (82)"

The latent-state generators may thus be referred to as \u2018doubly-hidden Markov models\u2019. Accordingly, even if the intermediary Xt process is Markovian, this would not directly imply a meaningful sense of quantum Markovianity of the outputs. Nevertheless, there is some sense in which processes with non-Markovian control outputs Xt have more deeply hidden structure.\nTo benchmark the performance of the memory-assisted protocol on a process with higher Markov order of the control symbols Xt, the 2-1 golden-mean process was chosen for comparison. The timeaveraged density matrix of the memoryless approach for both models is kept the same, \u03be0 = 12(\u03c3\n(0) + \u03c3(1)). The comparison is shown in Fig. 8, where we see that more work is extracted from the nonMarkovian generator. This example suggests that memory can become even more important for enabling work extraction from non-Markovian generators of quantum processes, since the extractable structure can be more deeply hidden."
