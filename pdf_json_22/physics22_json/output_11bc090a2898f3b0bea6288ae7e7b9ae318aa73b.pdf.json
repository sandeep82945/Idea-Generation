    "abstractText": "Within the standard perturbative approach of Peierls, a charge-density wave is usually assumed to have a cosine shape of weak amplitude. In nonlinear physics, we know that waves can be deformed. What are the effects of the nonlinearities of the electron-lattice models in the physical properties of Peierls systems? We study in details a nonlinear discrete model, introduced by Brazovskii, Dzyaloshinskii and Krichever. First, we recall its exact analytical solution at integrable points. It is a cnoidal wave, with a continuous envelope, which may slide over the lattice potential at no energy cost, following Fr\u00f6hlich\u2019s argument. Second, we show numerically that integrability-breaking terms modify some important physical properties. The envelope function may become discontinuous: electrons form stronger chemical bonds which are local dimers or oligomers. We show that an Aubry transition from the sliding phase to an insulating pinned phase occurs when the model is no longer integrable. Copyright O. C\u00e9pas and P. Qu\u00e9merais.

We study in details a nonlinear discrete model, introduced by Brazovskii, Dzyaloshinskii and Krichever. First, we recall its exact analytical solution at integrable points. It is a cnoidal wave, with a continuous envelope, which may slide over the lattice potential at no energy cost, following Fr\u00f6hlich\u2019s argument. Second, we show numerically that integrability-breaking terms modify some important physical properties. The envelope function may become discontinuous: electrons form stronger chemical bonds which are local dimers or oligomers. We show that an Aubry transition from the sliding phase to an insulating pinned phase occurs when the model is no longer integrable.\nCopyright O. C\u00e9pas and P. Qu\u00e9merais.

            "text": "In 1955, the instability of a simple linear metallic chain of equidistant atoms was predicted by Peierls [1, 2]. Below a critical temperature, called Peierls temperature, a new state emerges which is characterized by a lattice distortion associated to an electronic charge-density modulation. This state is called a charge-density wave (CDW) state. The current CDW theory is essentially based on the Fr\u00f6hlich model [3] where the Hamiltonian of an electron gas is perturbed by an electron-lattice interaction which is linear with the lattice distortion (for particularly comprehensive reviews, see Refs. [4,5]). The Peierls transition then results from the energy lowering of the occupied electronic states below the Fermi level which exceeds the energy cost of the elastic distortion at low temperatures. Linear response approximation for the electrons has been extensively used in this theory: the static electronic Lindhard susceptibility of a one-dimensional metal \u03c7(q,\u03c9= 0), calculated at first-order in perturbation theory, shows a peak at q0 = 2kF , kF being the Fermi wavevector [6]. An atomic position modulation \u03b4xq0 with wavevector q0 then induces a proportional modulation of the electronic charge density\n\u03b4\u03c1q0 = g\u03c7(q0, 0)\u03b4xq0 , where g is the so-called electron-phonon coupling constant. The electronic energies close to the Fermi level are modified and an electronic gap opens up due to the perturbation induced by the lattice modulation. The total energy is minimized with respect to the distortion parameter \u03b4xq0 , also fixing the charge modulation \u03b4\u03c1q0 and the electronic gap. Below the Peierls temperature, \u03b4xq0 and \u03b4\u03c1q0 are non-vanishing and the CDW state is stabilized [4, 5]. The resulting modulation of the position of atom i along the chain and its electronic charge are given by\n\u03b4x i \u223c \u03b4xq0 cos (q0ia+\u03c6) , (1) \u03b4\u03c1i \u223c \u03b4\u03c1q0 cos (q0ia+\u03c6) , (2)\nwhere a is the interatomic distance and \u03c6 a phase. One sees that when the parameter q0a2\u03c0 is a rational number, the charge modulation \u03b4\u03c1i and the lattice distortion \u03b4x i repeat after a period. The chain has a periodicity and the CDW is said to be commensurate. Reversely, when q0a 2\u03c0 is an irrational number, the chain has no periodicity and the CDW is incommensurate. It was suggested by Fr\u00f6hlich [3] that in the incommensurate case, the total energy does not depend on the phase \u03c6. In other words, there is a continuous degeneracy of the ground-state with respect to the phase, and the charge and lattice modulation may move freely along the chain: the CDW is not pinned by the lattice, it can slide freely. One says that the system has a Fr\u00f6hlich conductivity. Reversely, in the commensurate case, this continuous degeneracy is lost and the CDW is pinned by the lattice [7].\nMost discussions on CDW systems, in one or two dimensions, are based on the above linear response scheme. Further approximations may ameliorate the theory, for example by replacing the Lindhard susceptibility by the generalized susceptibility obtained within the random phase approximation in order to include Coulomb interactions [8]. Other authors have also developed strong electron-phonon coupling theories [8\u201311], especially for two-dimensional CDW systems. However, these developments remain basically in the same perturbative framework for the electrons and the results are not fundamentally modified: the CDW state results from the instability of a metal, as proposed by Peierls.\nFurthermore, whether or not the Peierls-Fr\u00f6hlich theory applies to experiments remains a controversial issue. Indeed, there is now a profusion of materials undergoing CDW transitions, where the theory can be tested. Beside well-known quasi-one-dimensional (1D) compounds [12,13] such as the trichalchogenides of transition metals (NbSe3 for example), many 2D and even 3D CDWs exist. Notably, among the dichalchogenides, the commensurate/incommensurate 2D CDW states in 1T-TaS2, 2H-TaSe2 and 1T-TiSe2 were discussed by Rossnagel [14]. Based on detailed experimental ARPES data, he was able to show that it is the lowering of all occupied electronic bands which stabilizes the CDW, not only the lowering of the electronic state energies close to the Fermi level. Similarly, square nets of chalcogenides (Se or Te) are present in many binary, ternary and quaternary compounds [15, 16]. All these square nets undergo commensurate or incommensurate Peierls distortions which are described in terms of various polychalcogenide oligomers formation in the nets [15\u201319]. Here again, as noted by Patschke [16], the electronic band calculations show that the CDW stabilization is dominated by low-lying electronic levels. Another striking example has been recently provided by Gaspard [20]. Many covalent materials of columns 14-16 elements (examples are As, Se, Te, Br, I) develop 3D networks of successive short and large atomic distances. These structures appear as Peierls distortions from an unstable cubic structure. Yet, the electronic energy gain involved in these distortions goes well beyond the simple perturbation of the levels close to the Fermi level. A last challenging example is provided by the now common observations of 2D or 3D, static or fluctuating, CDW orders in Cu-based high-Tc superconductors [21\u201325]. Although it is an ubiquitous phenomenon, the origin of these CDW orders remains elusive [26]. It however enlightens and renews the possibility of electron-based mechanisms (i.e. with an\nelectronic \u201cglue\u201d) of superconductivity in cuprates [27\u201330]. Such observations contradict somewhat the simplistic Peierls-Fr\u00f6hlich linearized framework. In reality, in order to construct a more general theory of CDW, one needs first to consider models with nonlinear electron-lattice interactions. Any realistic model is, by essence, nonlinear. The minimal number of ingredients to describe the basic chemical situation is then three. There is first an attractive term which gives a resonant bonding state for the electrons. It decreases with the interatomic distance in a nonlinear way. Secondly, one needs a repulsive part to avoid the collapse of the structure. These first two terms explain the chemical bonding of atoms in a standard way. Finally, a pressure term is added which may represent the effect of a real mechanical pressure, or may model a chemical pressure induced by the surrounding atoms. All these ingredients form discrete models since any atomic structure is discrete. These models have to be studied nonperturbatively, in order to find both the distortions and the electronic energies self-consistently and without expanding a priori around a putative metallic state.\nIn the present paper, we study such a nonlinear model in 1D, which was introduced by Brazovskii, Dzyaloshinskii and Krichever [31]. We call it the BDK model and its definition is given in section 2. In their original paper, the authors have shown that for special values of the model parameters, the CDW problem can be solved exactly and the solution explicitly written, whatever the electronic density of the chain. Owing to its theoretical importance, we discuss and demonstrate the solution anew, partly in our own way, in section 3. The remarkable result obtained by Brazovskii, Dzyaloshinskii and Krichever is due to the connection which exists between the BDK model and some classical integrable models [32,33], such as the Toda lattice [34, 35] and the Volterra lattice [36] (described in section 3.5). Another important point is that the BDK model appears to be a discrete version of an earlier continuous Peierls model [37,38]. The exact solution of that model also results from the integrability of nonlinear equations, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations.\nThe exact solution of the BDK model is such that not only the incommensurate phases are unpinned (a result that seems to strengthen the original views of Peierls and Fr\u00f6hlich [1\u20133]), but also, surprisingly, so are the commensurate phases. In other words, the discrete nature of the lattice seems to have no effect. This may justify the use of continuous models. However, the situation is more complex and the question which naturally arises is then: what happens beyond the range of parameters for which the model is integrable? Dzyaloshinskii and Krichever have briefly discussed the issue [39]. They have recognized that when integrability is lost, pinning should generically occur in the commensurate cases. They argue by using an analogy with a model previously proposed by Aubry [40], that in the incommensurate case, two regimes should be distinguished [39]: a weak nonlinear regime where the unpinned incommensurate phase is protected by the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem, and a strong nonlinear regime -the stochastic regime- where many pinned metastable configurations could appear in the system. Soon after, Aubry and Le Daeron [41] have shown that a sliding-to-pinned transition occurs for incommensurate ground-states by varying the parameters in two other discrete models: the Sue-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model [42] and the Holstein model [43]. These two models are intimately related to the BDK model and appear as some limit cases (see section 2). The above sliding-to-pinned transition in the incommensurate CDW ground-state is an Aubry transition, originally called the transition by breaking of analyticity [40]. It modifies the physics of CDW systems [44]. In particular, CDWs can hardly be described in the stochastic regime by continuous models, owing to intrinsic pinning and the presence of many metastable states separated by local energy barriers [45]. Thanks to the similarity between the problem of CDW energy minimization and the time evolution of a discrete dynamical system introduced by Aubry [40], the pinning is associated with the destruction of the KAM tori of the dynamical system, when the nonlinearities become strong enough. The\nconcomitant apparition of chaos or stochasticity is qualitatively discussed by Dzyaloshinskii and Krichever when integrability is lost [39].\nThe present paper next provides a detailed numerical study of the effect of adding perturbations that either break or conserve the integrability of the BDK model. In the commensurate case (section 4.2), we establish a phase diagram when integrability is preserved, showing the relative energies of the exact solutions. When integrability is lost, we show that the CDW is always pinned, as expected on general grounds, and its shape modified. In the incommensurate case (section 4.3), we find that integrability-breaking terms trigger an Aubry transition at a certain threshold, beyond which the phase is pinned. Pinned phases are computed and have locally ordered atomic structures, which are dimers or oligomers, distinct from the exact solutions in integrable cases. The transition between pinned and sliding phases is found not only by breaking integrability, but also by changing the external pressure, making experimental verification possible."

            "text": "The BDK model is a combination and a generalization of two paradigmatic tight-binding models. The first one is due to Holstein and was called the molecular-crystal model [43], whereas the second is known as SSH model [42]. They are sketched in Fig. 1. The Holstein model in one dimension describes a chain of molecules i, each carrying an internal vibrational degree of freedom bi which modulates the on-site electronic energy level. The electrons may move along the chain with a constant hopping integral between molecules. The SSH model describes an atomic chain and was originally introduced to explain the physical properties of polyacetylene. Contrary to the Holstein model, in the SSH model there is a fixed on-site potential energy for the electrons, but the hopping integrals ai for the electrons to hop from atom i to atom i + 1 are linearly modulated by the interatomic distances \u2113i ,\nai = 1+\u03b1(\u2113i \u2212 \u2113\u0304) , (3)\nwhere \u2113\u0304 is the mean lattice spacing, and \u03b1 a parameter which can be interpretated as an electron-phonon coupling constant. The Hamiltonian of both models may be written with dimensionless variables and an overall energy scale t, as follows:\nHHolstein/t = \u2212 \u2211\ni,\u03c3\n(c\u2020i+1,\u03c3ci,\u03c3 + h.c.) + \u2211\ni,\u03c3\nbic \u2020 i,\u03c3ci,\u03c3 + \u03be \u2211\ni\nbi 2 , (4)\nHSSH/t = \u2212 \u2211\ni,\u03c3\nai(c \u2020 i+1,\u03c3ci,\u03c3 + h.c.) + \u03ba\n\u2211\ni\n(\u2113i \u2212 \u2113\u0304)2 . (5)\nIn these expressions, i label the sites (atoms or molecules), \u03c3 the electron spin, and (c\u2020i,\u03c3, ci,\u03c3) are the usual (creation/annihilation) fermionic operators. \u03be and \u03ba are dimensionless parameters associated to the elastic energies of the distortions. For both models, the kinetic energy of atoms is neglected and the variables {\u2113i} (or {ai}) and {bi} are classical ones which have to be determined self-consistently, in order to minimize the energy. The spirit of these models is to keep the first linear and quadratic terms as an expansion in bi or (\u2113i \u2212 \u2113\u0304).\na) Holstein\nThe BDK model [31] aims at describing the same physics of 1D chains but introduces some important differences. It similarly has two versions that distinguish the \u201cVolterra\u201d case from the \u201cToda\u201d case.1\n\u2022 The first BDK Hamiltonian (Volterra case) writes\nH/t = \u2212 \u2211\ni,\u03c3\n1 2 e\u2212 \u2113i 2 (c\u2020i+1,\u03c3ci,\u03c3 + h.c.) + \u03ba \u2211\ni\ne\u2212 \u03bb\u2113i 2 + p \u2211\ni\n\u2113i . (6)\nIt is a modification of the SSH model (see Fig. 1), in that it assumes that the hopping parameter is exponentially decreasing with the interatomic distance,\nai = 1 2 e\u2212 \u2113i 2 . (7)\nBy definition of the tight-binding approximation [6], the ai are indeed the overlap between two successive atomic (or molecular) wave functions and an exponential dependence is a fairly realistic choice. Its special dimensionless form (7) is taken for the sake of commodity, in particular to match the standard definitions in the classical integrable models. The first term in the Hamiltonian leads to an effective attraction between atoms. The second term is necessary to describe the formation of a chemical bond (see below), it is repulsive and exponentially decreasing. Its range is controlled by the parameter \u03bb. The last and third term involves the pressure p which controls the mean distance \u2113\u0304 between the atoms. Since the distance between sites i and i+1 always satisfies 0< \u2113i <\u221e,\n1The use of the names \u201cVolterra\u201d and \u201cToda\u201d is due to the connection with the classical integrable models with the same names, that will be explicit in section 3.5. Note that in the BDK paper [31], the Volterra case is also called model I, and the Toda case, model II.\nthe variables ai satisfy the following constraint for all i,\n0< ai < 1 2 . (8)\nThe model depends on bond length variables {\u2113i} (or {ai}) that have to be self-consistently determined. An important difference with SSH is that it does not linearize the hopping integrals around a hypothetical metallic state. As a consequence, the issue concerning the cohesion of the chain, i.e. the formation of chemical bonds, is treated on an equal footing with that concerning the CDW.\n\u2022 The second BDK Hamiltonian (Toda case) writes\nH/t = \u2212 \u2211\ni,\u03c3\n1 2 e\u2212 \u2113i 2 (c\u2020i+1,\u03c3ci,\u03c3+h.c.)+\u03ba \u2211\ni\ne\u2212 \u03bb\u2113i 2 +p \u2211\ni\n\u2113i+ \u2211\ni,\u03c3\nbic \u2020 i,\u03c3ci,\u03c3+\u03be \u2211\ni\nbi 2 . (9)\nIt is the same as the first BDK model but it contains two additional terms which involve additional classical variables {bi} that describe the local Holstein vibrational degrees of freedom (see Fig. 1). They also have to be self-consistently determined.\nLet us consider a first and simple example of chemical bond interactione, that of Hamiltonian (6) with two sites, two electrons and p = 0. The hopping of electrons between the two sites at distance \u2113 gives a bonding state of energy \u221212 e \u2212 \u21132 , which is filled by the two electrons (spin up and spin down). The electronic energy is \u2212e\u2212 \u2113 2 and the elastic cost \u03bae\u2212 \u03bb\u2113 2 . The total energy written in units of 2t is\nW0 = \u2212 1 2 e\u2212 \u2113 2 + \u03ba 2 e\u2212 \u03bb\u2113 2 , (10)\nwhich is represented in Fig. 2, after normalization. It has a minimum at\n\u21130 = 2\n\u03bb\u2212 1 ln(\u03ba\u03bb) , (11)\nwhich is the equilibrium length of the covalent bond. The dimer is stable only when \u03ba > 1/\u03bb and \u03bb > 1. We will always consider that \u03bb and \u03ba satisfy these two conditions.\nIn the following, we are particularly interested in periodic configurations of the lattice. We call N this period which is an integer, so that\nai+N = ai\u21d4 \u2113i+N = \u2113i , (12) bi+N = bi , (13)\nfor all i. The total number of sites is L = NS, where S is the number of unit-cells in the system. We thus have N independent variables to determine in the Volterra case, {a1, a2, . . . , aN}, and 2N in the Toda case by addition of the set {b1, b2, . . . , bN}.\nThe density per site c of pairs of electrons is taken as,\nc = r N , (14)\nwhere r/N is an irreducible fraction. When the configuration is incommensurate, the period N is infinite and c is an irrational number. In numerical computations, it is convenient to approximate c with a sequence of irreducible rational approximants rn/Nn where\nrn Nn \u2192 c , (15)\nwhen n \u2192 +\u221e. An incommensurate configuration is thus approximated by commensurate periodic configurations with period N = Nn."

In the Volterra case, H(k) is the same, replacing bi by 0. Since H(k) is an Hermitian matrix, it has N real eigenvalues E\u03bd(k) labeled by \u03bd= {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N}, and N eigenvectors \u03c8\u03bd(k). The N energy bands {E\u03bd(k)} completely determine the electronic structure. Also note that H(\u2212k) = H(k)\u2217, which implies E\u03bd(k) = E\u03bd(\u2212k).\nWe show in the Appendix A that the eigenvalues are given by solving the equation,\nQ(E) = cos kN , (20)\nwhere Q(E) is a polynomial of degree N , written as\nQ(E) = A0 EN \u2212 I1EN\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 IN , (21)\nwhere the amplitude A0 respects A0 \u2261 (\u22121)N 2CN , with CN = \u220fN\ni=1 ai . By introducing the length of the unit-cell,\nI0 \u2261 N \u2211\ni=1\n\u2113i , (22)\none gets A0 = (\u22121)N 2N\u22121e I0 2 . The other quantities Im, m = 1, . . . , N , that appear in Q(E), are polynomials in the variables {ai}, {bi}. They can be derived explicitly at a given N , e.g. by iteration over the amplitudes of the eigenvectors (as shown in Appendix A) or by the direct calculation of the characteristic polynomial. As an example, for N = 3 in the Toda case, we have\nI1 = b1 + b2 + b3 , I2 = a1 2 + a2 2 + a3 2 \u2212 b1 b2 \u2212 b2 b3 \u2212 b1 b3 ,\nI3 = b1 b2 b3 \u2212 b1a22 \u2212 b2a32 \u2212 b3a12 . (23)\nFor N = 4, in the Volterra case (bi = 0), we have\nI1 = 0 , I2 = a1 2 + a2 2 + a3 2 + a4 2 , I3 = 0 , I4 = \u2212a12a32 \u2212 a22a42 .\n(24)\nThe corresponding Q(E) with N = 4 is given in Fig. 3 (a). Note that the coefficients Im with m odd vanish. That remains true for any even value of N in the Volterra case. As a consequence Q(E) =Q(\u2212E), so that if E\u03bd(k) is a solution of Eq. (20), then \u2212E\u03bd(k) is another solution. The energy spectrum is symmetric with respect to E = 0. This symmetry is not true in the Toda case, however.\nIn the general case, for any N , the first terms can be immediately obtained, e.g.\nI1 = N \u2211\ni=1\nbi , (25)\nwhich is the trace of the matrix H(k). It can be chosen to be zero by adding a constant to the energy. Similarly,\nI2 = N \u2211\ni=1\n1 2 bi 2 + ai 2 \u2212 1 2 I21 . (26)\nThe band structure equation (20) is an algebraic equation of degree N that has N real solutions, E\u03bd(k). We emphasize that the solutions E\u03bd(k) are thus some functions of {Im}, the\nparameters of the equation, and not of the individual {ai}, {bi} (only through the Im). The band structure is thus entirely determined by a number of parameters that is smaller than the number of actual variables. Expected values of Q follow\n\u22121\u2264Q(E\u03bd(k))\u2264 1. (27)\nThe positions of the energy bands can thus be deduced from the plotting of Q(E). An example with N = 4 is given in Fig. 3 (b): it has four bands in the reduced Brillouin zone. Note that gaps separate all the bands, which is the generic situation.\nA periodic perturbation with periodicity N couples the degenerate energy states labeled by k and k \u00b1 2\u03c0N and opens a gap. But the perturbation also couples the states labeled by k and k\u00b1 4\u03c0N , k\u00b1 6\u03c0 N , etc. This implies secondary gaps away from Fermi energy. However, there are specific configurations, with some symmetries of the potentials and kinetic terms, where the higher-order couplings effectively vanish, thus leaving the corresponding gaps closed."

(38)\nThese are the equations for the {ai}, {bi} that have to be solved. The difficulty is that they are nonlinear equations in general. Explicit equations are derived in Appendix B.\nFor the sake of simplicity, let us focus our study on the Volterra case. One gets\n\u03b4W \u03b4\u2113i = 0 , (39)\nfor all sites i. The linear response consists in linearizing these equations close to a non distorted uniform state, i.e. a metallic state of lattice constant \u2113\u0304.

If the matrix M has positive eigenvalues, the only solution is \u03b4\u2113i = 0 for all i and is a metal. When an eigenvalue vanishes, however, the metallic state is unstable. In a 1D chain, the Lindhard susceptibility is infinite for a modulation at q0 = 2kF , so that CDW instabilities develop at q0 for infinitesimally small coupling strength.\nGiven that the modulation is expected at q0, one assumes in the standard Peierls approach [4,5] that the solution of Eqs. (39) for the bond lengths \u2113i is given by a simple cosine Ansatz,\n\u2113i = \u2113\u0304+ u cos(q0i\u2113\u0304+\u03c6) , (42)\nwhere u is the amplitude and \u03c6 a phase. For u = 0, the model is that of an undistorted metal with lattice parameter \u2113\u0304. This approach assumes a weak modulation, u \u226a \u2113\u0304. The energy spectrum is then calculated by including the resulting perturbation, at first order in perturbation theory. The energy W of the Peierls Ansatz is calculated as function of u and \u03c6. Note that in the incommensurate case, the energy generally depends on u but not on \u03c6: the energy as a function of u and \u03c6 has a \u201cMexican hat\u201d shape. The minimization of the energy with respect to u,\n\u03b4W \u03b4u = 0 , (43)\nfixes the optimal modulation amplitude u and the energy gap at Fermi level: it is called the \u201cgap equation\u201d and results from the special cosine Ansatz and from keeping the lowest order terms in u in the energy including a logarithmic singularity.\nIn section 3, we explain the exact solutions of the BDK model at integrable points without relying on the linear response and Peierls Ansatz, which proves in general incorrect. We detail in section 4 the solutions of Eq. (39) which shape can be very different from the cosine and brings important physical consequences."

This may be seen as the consequence of some special symmetries of the chain configuration. In this case, the parameters Im are not all independent, so that the number of equations (44) changes. In fact, we will see in section 3.3.2 that the exact solution of the model in its simplest form (34), is the 1-gap Ansatz (g = 1) for the Toda case and the 2-gap Ansatz (g = 2) for the Volterra case.\nIn the generic case, the calculation of the gradients \u03b4W/\u03b4Im is done in section 3.1.

The degeneracies of the solutions are discussed in section 3.4. Finally, as reviewed in section 3.5, the expressions of the g-gap Ans\u00e4tze for the chain configuration defined by variables {ai}, {bi} are explicit, thanks to a connection with classical integrable models.

Let us call E\u2212\u03bd and E + \u03bd , respectively the minimum and maximum of the energy for the band \u03bd.

When passing onto an integral over E, the \u00b1k degeneracy implies a factor 2, so that \u03c1(E) = L\u03c0 dk dE , which can be calculated directly from Eq.

R2N (E) is a polynomial of degree 2N that can be factorized: each of the root of Q(E)\u00b1 1 = 0 is a band edge (see Fig. 3), so that R2N (E) \u2265 0 and (\u22121)\u03bdQ\u2032(E) > 0 in the allowed energy bands.

We are facing now an \u201cinverse\u201d problem: what is (are) the possible chain configuration(s), i.e. the values of the local potentials {bi}, and hopping parameters {ai}, that give rise to a particular spectrum, for which those gaps close (for a more general definition, see Ref.

If the degeneracy occurs at k = 0, the algebraic equation, Q(E) = 1 (obtained from Eq. (20)), has two equal roots, i.e. a double root e. If instead, it occurs at k = \u00b1\u03c0/N , equation Q(E) = \u22121 has a double root. Wherever it occurs, e is a double root of R2N (E)\u2261 1\u2212Q(E)2 = 0.\nWhen an algebraic equation has a double root, its discriminant\u2206 vanishes [48]. A discriminant is a nonlinear function of the coefficients of the equation (here the Im). Here, we want to vary the coefficients from Im to Im+\u03b4Im with the constraint that the double root remains a double root, i.e. we have the constraint \u03b4\u2206= 0, which implies\n\u03b4\u2206= N \u2211\ni=1\n\u2202\u2206\n\u2202 Im\n\u03b4Im = 0 , (60)\nand gives a linear dependency relation between all \u03b4Im. As an example, let us consider an equation of degree 2, E2 \u2212 I1E \u2212 I2 = 0. The discriminant \u2206 = I21 + 4I2 gives, at linear order, a dependency relation \u03b4\u2206 = 0 which writes 2I1\u03b4I1 + 4\u03b4I2 = 0. This condition ensures that, however the coefficients Im vary, degenerate solutions remain so. More generally, one may find such dependency relations at linear order in \u03b4Im, without computing the discriminants. In our case, since a double root e of equation Q(E) = 1 is also a simple root of Q\u2032(E) = 0, the first term of Eq. (46) vanishes, Q\u2032(e) = 0, and, keeping the notations defined above, one gets\nN \u2211\nm=0\nlm(e)\u03b4Im = 0 , (61)\nwhich is a dependency relation of the \u03b4Im. One finds such an equation for any double root e of R2N (E).\nEquation (61) should be viewed as an Ansatz for the chain configuration, when a gap is closed. To see this more clearly, let us rewrite it as a system of equations in ai variables,\nN \u2211\nm=0\nlm(e) \u03b4Im \u03b4ai = 0 , (62)\nfor all sites i. Since Im are functions of {ai}, {bi}, these equations are local equations that determine some constraints or symmetries on the hopping parameters, {ai} and the potentials, {bi}. This defines some special Ansatz of the chain configuration. We give an explicit example in section 4.2.\nEquations (61) are formal conditions forcing the matrices H(k) to have a spectrum with a closed gap at e (see also [33,49]).

If g = 1, only the last three equations remain in the Toda case, and they do have a solution in general (the integrals, which are elliptic for g = 1, can be inverted). We emphasize that this is the most important result obtained by Brazovskii, Dzyaloshinskii and Krichever in their paper [31]: a minimum of the energy is realized for the 1-gap Ansatz, in the Toda case. In the Volterra case, a slight modification of the argument is needed. The equations with odd m (in particular Eq. (75)) do not exist and the solution is the 2-gap Ansatz [31] (see also Ref. [50]), which results from the E\u2192\u2212E symmetry. We present numerical check of these claims afterwards.\n\u2022 For the generalized BDK model, Eq.

(83)\nThe evolution of H(0)(t) subject to this equation is unitary, i.e. H(0)(t) and H(0)(0) are related by a unitary transformation. An immediate consequence is that the N eigenvalues of H(0) are conserved quantities when the variables ai(t), bi(t) obey the Toda nonlinear equations (80). In other words, the spectrum of H(0) is invariant when the variables evolve under the Toda flow. Since there are N independent conserved quantities and 2N variables, it is a classical integrable model in the sense of Arnold and Liouville.\nThe connection with the BDK problem arises because H(0) is precisely the matrix defining the tight-binding problem, Eq. (19), at k = 0. The eigenvalues of H(0) being conserved, the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial are also conserved. They are precisely the\ncoefficients Im, defined by Eq. (21), which are therefore also constants of motion of the Toda chain. The Im form a set of action variables and the level sets Im = C stm are the Liouville tori of the classical integrable model (for corresponding angle variables, see Ref. [35]).\nBack to the minimization of the Peierls problem, a solution of the Toda equations of motion, parametrized by the time t, conserves the same Im, and since the energy W depends only on Im, W is also conserved. The configurations ai(t), bi(t) have the same energy W than the initial configuration ai(0), bi(0). The solution of the equations of motion thus provides continuously degenerate solutions of the Peierls model parametrized by t.\nSome solutions of the Toda equations of motion are explicitly known. In particular, if the initial conditions ai(0), bi(0) (or the Im) are such that the matrix H(k) has a single gap, then any ai(t), bi(t) define the same spectrum with a single gap. In fact, the one-gap solution is precisely the original constant profile solution, Toda\u2019s cnoidal wave [34], rewritten as,\nai(t) = a\u0304 \u03d13(k0i + vt, q)\u03d13(k0(i + 2) + vt, q) \u03d123(k0(i + 1) + vt, q)\n1/2\n,\nbi(t) = v\u0304 + v\n\u03d1\u20323(k0i + vt, q) \u03d13(k0i + vt, q) \u2212 \u03d1\u20323(k0(i + 1) + vt, q) \u03d13(k0(i + 1) + vt, q) ,\n(84)\nwith \u03d13(z, q) the Jacobi \u03d1-function defined by its Fourier series (see Appendix F for details),\n\u03d13(z, q) = 1+ 2 +\u221e \u2211\nn=1\nqn 2 cos(2\u03c0nz) , (85)\nwhere z is a real number here (but could be a complex number). \u03d13(z, q) is a periodic function in z with period 1 and depends on a parameter q, called the nome, which satisfies 0 \u2264 q < 1. This parameter determines the weights of the harmonics. In the limit q \u2192 0, the function is close to a cosine with small amplitude 2q (and at q = 0, it becomes a constant, 1). When q\u2192 1, on the contrary, it contains many harmonics and becomes highly distorted. Examples of plots of \u03d13(z, q) can be found in appendix F.\nAt t = 0, the solution depends on some parameters. Apart from the speed of the center of mass, v\u0304 which describes the collective translational motion of all atoms, the solution is characterized by a dimensionless wavevector k0, an amplitude a\u0304 and a shape/amplitude parameter q. First, to ensure that the variables ai(t) and bi(t) are periodic in space, ai+N (t) = ai(t), etc., one needs because of the periodicity of \u03d13(z, q),\nk0 = r N , (86)\nwhere r is an integer. The other parameters can be chosen arbitrarily, and characterize a given initial condition.\nIn order for Eqs. (84) to be a solution of the nonlinear equations of motion (80), the parameter v has to satisfy the condition (see Ref. [53] for a correction of the initial result of Toda),\nv = \u00b1 \u03d11(k0, q) \u03d1\u20321(0, q) a\u0304 , (87)\nwhich depends on the amplitude a\u0304 and \u03d11(z, q) is defined in Appendix F. The solution has some definite values for the conserved quantities {Im}, such as\nN \u220f\ni=1\nai(t) = a\u0304 N = 1 2N e\u2212 \u2211N i=1 \u2113i(t)/2 , (88)\nwhich proves that the total length is conserved. One gets\na\u0304 = 1 2 e\u2212 I0 2N . (89)\nFurthermore, from the second Eq. (84) and the periodic boundary conditions, one finds,\nI1 = N \u2211\ni=1\nbi(t) = v\u0304N , (90)\nwhich is the conservation law of the total momentum or that of the trace of the matrix H(0), since all eigenvalues are conserved. I2 can be computed by\nI2 = N \u2211\ni=1\nai(t) 2 \u2212\nN \u2211\ni=1\nbi(t)bi+1(t) , (91)\nand is conserved. Eq. (89) determines a\u0304 knowing I0, Eq. (90) determines v\u0304 knowing I1 and finally Eq. (91) determines q knowing I2. The other Im, m > 2 are no longer independent parameters for the 1-gap solution, as we have seen in section 3.2.1, so that there is a complete equivalence between (I0, I1, I2) and (a\u0304, v\u0304, q), the parameters of the solution. We emphasize that this is the very special cnoidal wave solution of the Toda equations of motion, which moves without deformation and can be seen as a \u201csoliton train\u201d [34,35]. It has a single gap in the spectrum (H(0) has many doubly degenerate eigenvalues), the position of which depends on k0.4 Some other, multi-gap, solutions are known, and can be expressed with multi-dimensional \u03d1functions.5 They are more complicated and depend on further parameters. They will not be useful in the following.\nIt is remarkable that all matrices H(0) with a single gap are known and take the form of Eq. (81) with {ai}, {bi} explicitly given by Eqs. (84), where vt, noted \u03c6 below gives a free parameter for this family of solutions.\nSince the exact solution of the BDK model at integrable points (in its nongeneralized version) is given by a 1-gap Ansatz, its explicit form is necessarily given by Eqs. (84). As we have seen, its explicit parameters (a\u0304, v\u0304, q) are in direct bijection with (I0, I1, I2), extracted by solving the \u201cgap equations\u201d. Therefore, the Toda-BDK model gives a continuous family of degenerate extrema, parametrized by the continuous parameter t (or \u03c6 = vt)."

For the 1-gap potential, only the first gap is opened. When the periodicity is N and the spectrum folded in the reduced Brillouin zone, the position of the gap thus depends on r in k0 = r/N .\n5For the original derivation in the context of KdV, see Ref. [54]. In the context of the Toda chain, see Ref. [55].\nThe pair of Lax evolves again according to\nH\u0307(0) = [H(0), A] , (94)\nwhen the variables ai obey Volterra equations. Thus, similarly to the previous section, Eq. (92) defines an isospectral evolution: the eigenvalues of H(0) and all coefficients Im are independent of t. In particular, the energy defined by the BDK model (34), which is a pure function of Im, does not vary in time. Any solution of (92), evolving with time, remains at the same energy and defines a degenerate manifold of states for the BDK model.\nConsider the following particular solution, which is related to Toda\u2019s solution by a B\u00e4cklund transformation [34],\nai(t) = a\u0304 \u03d13(k0i + vt, q)\u03d13(k0(i + 3) + vt, q) \u03d13(k0(i + 1) + vt, q)\u03d13(k0(i + 2) + vt, q)\n1/2\n, (95)\nwhere\nv = \u00b12 \u03d11(2k0, q) \u03d1\u20321(0, q) a\u03042 .

The ground-states form a degenerate manifold of dimension one. The expression of the ground state is parametrized by a single continuous parameter [31]:\n\u2022 Toda case: the solution is the following 1-gap Ansatz. The chain configuration {ai}, {bi} is given by Eqs.

(99)\nIn both cases, the energy of the configuration does not depend on the free parameter \u03c6. It ensures that the CDW can slide between the different degenerate states at no energy cost. This result, which holds at integrable points, is valid for both the commensurate and incommensurate CDW. An example of plot of \u2113i , Eq. (99) is given in Fig. 4 for two degenerate solutions (corresponding to two different values of \u03c6).\nThe parameters of the solutions (a\u0304, v\u0304, q), or the independent parameters {Im} are obtained by solving the nonlinear \u201cgap equations\u201d. The parameters {Im} also determine the entire band structure: the Peierls gap at the Fermi level is open (and so is the symmetric gap with respect to E = 0 in the Volterra case) while all other secondary gaps are closed, which is a specificity of these 1 and 2-gap Ans\u00e4tze. Strictly speaking, the solutions are not only extrema, but from an analysis of small fluctuations, they are minima [56].\nFor the generalized BDK model at integrable points (35), all g-gap Ans\u00e4tze are possible extrema: it is not known in this case which of them is the ground state and it certainly depends on the model parameters.\nWe emphasize that the degeneracies result, at least in the commensurate case, from the very special choice of the BDK model W . The integrability of the Toda chain, for example, ensures that there is a canonical transformation from {ai}, {bi} to action-angle variables {Im}, {\u03d5m}. A canonical transformation is a bijective nonlinear change of coordinates [51], so that any generic model, not necessarily at integrable points, can be expressed in terms of the new variables by\nW ({ai}, {bi}) = \u2126({Im}, {\u03d5m}) . (100)\nThe BDK approach assumes that the model depends only on the {Im} and does not take into account the dependence in the {\u03d5m}, which would lift the degeneracy of the solutions. The motion on a Liouville torus generated by the Toda or Volterra equations implies no energy change in the Peierls model, thanks to this special choice.6 We will illustrate the lifting of the degeneracy for a generic model in section 4.\n6Alternatively, one could construct a model with an exact energy for the 1-gap Ansatz by including conjugate variables. For this Ansatz, all but one angular variables are time-independent [35], so that if W depends on the unique time-dependent variable \u03d5, the degeneracy is lifted: the solution describes a pinned CDW with a PeierlsNabarro barrier."

            "heading": "4 Beyond integrability",
            "text": "In this section, our concern is to understand what happens when the BDK model departs from integrable points in the parameter space. We will focus exclusively on the Volterra case, but our qualitative conclusions remain the same in the Toda case.\nOn general grounds, one expects that the degeneracy of the exact solutions, parametrized by the continuous parameter \u03c6 that describes free sliding, should be lifted, because the BDK model would no longer depend solely on the coefficients {Im} (see Eq. (100)). In that case, the states would be pinned. The situation is, however, more subtle. The change of regime from freely sliding states to pinned states is characteristic of an Aubry transition and we will show that such transitions occur here.\nThe Aubry transition, originally called the transition by breaking of analyticity, is associated to nonlinear terms in the equations as well as to chaotic transitions [40, 57, 58]. Indeed, the minimization equations,\n\u2200i , \u03b4W \u03b4\u2113i = 0 , (101)\nare essentially nonlinear equations for the chain configuration variables {\u2113i} (for example see Eq. (B.7) in appendix B). They can be viewed as a discrete-time map (where i plays the role of discrete time) where \u2113i is a function of the previous \u2113 j , j < i. Since this map is nonlinear, a chaotic transition may take place when the nonlinearity is strong enough: from the regular integrable solutions, the system can enter a stochastic regime characterized by the destruction of KAM tori and the rising of chaotic regions in the phase space [40,57,58]. This is the stochastic regime qualitatively suggested by Dzyaloshinskii and Krichever [39] for the present model. On the other hand, when the nonlinearity is small enough, KAM tori (evolving from Liouville tori of the integrable system) may nevertheless survive in incommensurate cases, thus preserving integrable sliding solutions. In a one-dimensional system as it is the case here, the Aubry transition between the two regimes is characterized by the apparition of discontinuities in the envelope function of the CDW modulation (which are nonanalyticities due to the destruction of KAM tori) [41, 44], which is defined and computed below for the present model. Furthermore, in the stochastic regime, many metastable states emerge (at higher energies) due to chaotic regions and coexist with the ground-state. It is important to stress that, although the ground-states are obtained inside the stochastic (chaotic) regime, they remain either periodic (in the commensurate case) or quasi-periodic (in the incommensurate case).\nAfter the definition of the envelope function in section 4.1, we examine two examples, a commensurate case, c = 1/4 (in section 4.2) and an incommensurate case, c = (3\u2212 p 5)/2 (in section 4.3)."

            "text": "Consider a wave with a modulated amplitude ai at site i and wavevector 2\u03c0c. The definition of the envelope function7 is aimed at filtering out the fast oscillations of the wave, which are necessarily discontinuous for a model with discrete sites (such as that in Fig. 4). It will replace a fast cosine modulation, e.g. ai = u cos(2\u03c0ic) by the 1-periodic function, f (\u03c6) = u cos(2\u03c0\u03c6), i.e. f (ic) = ai . This definition allows one to address the issue of the continuity or analyticity of the envelope function f .\nIn the incommensurate case, the wave is not periodic and c is an irrational number. There is an infinite number of distinct amplitudes {ai}. The envelope function f is defined to be a\n7It is also called the \u201chull\u201d function. The envelope of a wave is generally defined as a smooth curve connecting the maxima or minima, this is not the definition we use here.\nperiodic function with period 1, i.e. f (\u03c6 + 1) = f (\u03c6), and\nf (ic) = ai . (102)\nSince the numbers ic (mod 1) cover densely the interval [0, 1] when c is irrational, the function f is well-defined.\nIn the commensurate case, the wave is periodic with c = r/N and period N . The wave is entirely determined by a finite number of amplitudes {a1, . . . , aN}. The numbers \u03c6i = ic (mod 1) take N discrete values inside [0,1], so that the function\nf (\u03c6i) = ai , (103)\nis defined only at the N discrete points \u03c6i . To extend f to the entire interval [0,1], one could choose other close commensurabilities, for example,\ncm = mr + rp\u22121 mN + Np\u22121 . (104)\nIndeed, when m increases, cm \u2192 c = r/N and the points \u03c6i = icm(mod1) fill more and more the interval [0,1]. It thus makes sense to define an envelope function f in [0, 1] as the limiting function when m \u2192 +\u221e. In practice, in the incommensurate case as well, we consider a sequence of rational approximants of c, cn = rn/Nn (see Eq. 15), and only define the envelope functions fn(\u03c6i) at the Nn points, \u03c6i = ic (mod 1). When n increases, the number of points Nn increases and fn(\u03c6i) will converge onto f (\u03c6) defined in the interval [0,1].\nAt integrable points (as in section 3), we have analytic solutions of the form,\nai(\u03c6) = f (ic +\u03c6) , (105)\nwhere \u03c6 characterizes a given solution and f is periodic of period 1, see e.g. Eq. (98). If c is irrational, it is thus exactly of the form (102). If c is rational, there is no difficulty since f does not depend on c and one can choose a close irrational number for example. f is thus the envelope function. At integrable points, it is, therefore, a continuous function, both in commensurate and incommensurate cases.\nAway from the integrable regime, we will see the emergence of discontinuities in the envelope function: this is the breaking of analyticity characterizing the Aubry transition. We will argue that it occurs abruptly for the commensurate case. For the incommensurate case, the continuity of the envelope function may persist away from integrable points, at least in certain regions of parameters.\n4.2 Example of commensurate solution: c = 1/4\nIn this section, we consider the BDK model (Volterra case) at quarter filling c = 1/4. Since the chain has a periodicity of N = 4 sites in this case, the present example is the simplest, yet nontrivial example where the BDK results can be tested: the chain is defined by the only four inequivalent bond length variables, (\u21131,\u21132,\u21133,\u21134).\nAt integrable points, the ground state of the simplest BDK model [Eq. (34)] was argued to be the 2-gap Ansatz. We will compare that result with the numerical one. Furthermore, we consider two kinds of perturbations: one that conserves integrability (the generalized BDK model of Eq. (35)) in sections 4.2.1-4.2.3. This allows us to understand whether or not the other g-gap Ans\u00e4tze with g > 2 could be the ground state of some generalized model. In section 4.2.4, we consider a perturbation that explicitly breaks integrability and compute the solutions numerically."

Solving them allows to extract the optimal band structure parameters {Im}, and determine the stability of the different phases in parameter space and the corresponding energies.\nGeneric 3-gap Ansatz\nIn the most generic case, the four bands are separated by three gaps, as in Fig. 3. We expect the distortions to be generic in the phase space, so that all \u03b4Im must be independent. From Eq. (107) and the definitions of J0, J2, J4 in Appendix C, the \u201cgap equations\u201d then write\n1 S \u2211\nk\nQ(E1(k)) Q\u2032(E1(k)) = p , (108)\n1 S \u2211\nk\nA0E1(k)2 Q\u2032(E1(k)) = \u2212\u03be , (109)\n1 S \u2211\nk\nA0 Q\u2032(E1(k)) = \u03be4 . (110)\nThey are three nonlinear equations for the three unknowns I0, I2, I4. We have solved them numerically for given model parameters. However, it is not always possible to find a set of I0, I2, I4 satisfying these equations. For example, if \u03be4 = 0, there is no solution to these equations, as originally shown by BDK. Indeed, it is clear that the left-hand-side of Eq. (110) has Q\u2032(E1(k)) < 0 for all k (see Fig. 3 (a)) and is therefore strictly negative: \u03be4 must be negative, in order to have a chance to have a 3-gap solution. Similarly it is also clear that p and \u03be must be positive. The zone where the three equations have a solution that, furthermore, respects the constraints (C.5), is shown by the grey area in Fig. 5. A direct way to determine it is to compute the three sums for a large sample of physically-allowed coefficients I0, I2, I4 which values are chosen in a compact set. Outside this area, the 3-gap phase is no longer an extremum and other phases have to be sought. Once I0, I2, I4 are known, the energy W of the 3-gap Ansatz (which depends only on I0, I2, I4) can be computed. It is given as function of \u03be4 in Fig. 6 (green circles) for p = 0.02 and \u03be= 1, as an example.\n2-gap Ansatz\nConsider the situation of Fig. 7 where the gap at E = 0 (k = 0) is closed. By imposing this extra condition, which implies a condition on the {Im}, we impose a dependency relation of the \u03b4Im, as we have seen in section 3.2.1. First, which symmetry of the chain configuration does correspond this degeneracy? The degeneracy implies that the discriminant of the algebraic equation Q(E) = 1 vanishes, i.e. (see appendix C),\nI4 = \u22122C4 . (111)\nDeriving this relation with C4 = 1 16 e \u2212I0/2 leads to\n\u03b4I4 + 1 2 I4\u03b4I0 = 0 , (112)\nwhich indicates that \u03b4I4 and \u03b4I0 are dependent. Note that it can be found without the explicit form of the discriminant, thanks to Eq. (46). From the definition, I0 = \u22122 \u2211 i ln 2ai , \u03b4I0 \u03b4ai = \u2212 2ai , one obtains a series of equations,\nai \u03b4I4 \u03b4ai = I4 , (113)\nwhich implies that ai \u03b4I4 \u03b4ai\nis a constant, independent of i. With the definition of I4, Eq. (C.3) in Appendix C, these equations become,\na1 2a3 2 = a2 2a4 2 = \u2212 I4 2 . (114)\nIt means that the distortions ui , away from the average, \u2113i \u2261 \u2113\u0304+ ui satisfy\nu1 = \u2212u3 and u2 = \u2212u4 . (115)\nThis is a particular symmetry of the chain modulation. Any perturbation of the Hamiltonian respecting this symmetry, whatever its strength, leaves the gap at zero energy closed.8 This is the special 2-gap Ansatz for N = 4.\nIn the minimization equation (107), use the dependency relation (112) to replace \u03b4I4, and the independence of \u03b4I0 and \u03b4I2 to obtain the two \u201cgap equations\u201d,\nJ0 + p 2 + 1 2 \u03be4 I4 + 1 2 J4 I4 = 0 , (116)\nJ2 + \u03be = 0 , (117) 8This is somewhat different from a periodic perturbation in the continuous Schr\u00f6dinger equation, where one-\ngap potentials have finite-amplitudes (see footnote 2).\nwhich are rewritten\n1 S \u2211\nk\n1\u2212 cos kN Q\u2032(E1(k)) = \u2212p\u2212 \u03be4 I4 , (118)\n1 S \u2211\nk\nA0E1(k)2 Q\u2032(E1(k)) = \u2212\u03be , (119)\nthanks to A0 I4 = \u22121 (which is zero discriminant condition) and Q(E1(k)) = cos kN . These are two nonlinear equations for two unknowns variables I2 and I4, which are solved numerically. Alternatively, BDK replaces the sum over k by elliptic integrals that can be inverted with elliptic functions. It turns out that they have a solution in the whole range of the parameter space shown in Fig. 5: the physical constraints Eqs. (C.5) are also fulfilled, except in the region called \u201cno solution\u201d. The energy of the 2-gap Ansatz is given in Fig. 6 (in red squares).\n0-gap Ansatz (metal)\nConsider finally that the gaps at k/\u03c0 = 1/4 in Fig. 7 vanish (both the low energy and the high energy gaps have to vanish simultaneously). As above, it is possible to find an additional dependency relation from the zero discriminant. In this case, we have an undistorted metallic chain respecting a translational symmetry with a single parameter to optimize, its length. Its optimal energy is obtained in the thermodynamic limit and shown in Fig. 6 (black diamond).\nBy comparing the energies of the three considered states in Fig. 6, we see that the 2-gap Ansatz is always the lowest energy state, whatever \u03be4. It is lower than that of the metal (which proves the Peierls transition). It is also lower than the 3-gap Ansatz in the stability region (in between the two dashed lines) where both states coexist. The two energies are very close for \u03be4 \u223c \u22122.5, because the third gap of the 3-gap Ansatz closes continuously and the two states merge at the same time. These results have been confirmed by a direct numerical minimization (see section 4.2.3).\nAll the g-gap solutions may be extrema of the energy, at the condition that the \u201cgap equations\u201d have a solution. In the present example, where a perturbation \u03be4 is added to the stan-\ndard BDK model, the 2-gap Ansatz still remains the lowest energy state."

The solutions are unpinned commensurate CDW. The metal (or 0-gap) state is obtained from the 2-gap one when the \u201cradius\u201d of the 1D manifold vanishes. Indeed, the right-handside of Eq. (123) has a minimum which is reached at the uniform state a1 4 = a24 = \u2212 I4 2 when I4 = \u22122C4. This minimum is represented by a point (in black on the diagonal a1 = a2 of Fig. (8). The degenerate manifold continuously evolves when the gaps successively close, by the coalescence of the two curves onto a single one and the shrinking of the remaining curve onto a point.\nIn summary, for commensurate quarter filling, the distortions are nonzero but the modulation can be continuously deformed without energy cost. The sliding property results from the special choice of the energy that depends only on the Im of the band structure. For larger N , the degenerate manifold is of higher dimension, and one has, in general, more phason modes. For given model parameters, we have found that the lowest energy state is the 2-gap state. This approach allows one to visualize the degenerate chain configurations, even for the higher-energy Ans\u00e4tze.\nWe now solve numerically the minimization problem for the variables ai , instead of solving the nonlinear \u201cgap equations\u201d and taking a solution from the degenerate manifold. This allows one to check whether the lowest energy state found in section 4.2.2, is indeed a minimum.\nSince one knows, from the Volterra classical integrable model, the exact form of the distortions that give a spectrum with 2 gaps, one can compare the numerical solution with the exact one. Furthermore, one can modify the model, such as adding terms that cannot be expressed in terms of the {Im} and observe how the commensurate phases acquire some pinning, as generally expected."

            "text": "For a given set of model parameters at integrable points, we find the ground-state configurations of the chain (a1, a2, a3, a4) by a direct numerical minimization of the energy W (see appendix E). The various solutions are obtained by minimization of many randomly distorted chains as initial conditions: many degenerate solutions are thus obtained. For example, for p = 0.02, \u03be = 1, \u03be4 = \u22122, the solutions are shown in Fig. 8 (right) in blue points: they fall perfectly onto the expected degenerate manifold of the 2-gap Ansatz (in solid line). Once the {ai} are known, the values of Im are computed and are in perfect agreement with those extracted by solving the \u201cgap equations\u201d. Furthermore, we find that the 2-gap phase is always the ground state, as originally shown by BDK for \u03be4 = 0. When \u03be4 varies, the 3-gap phase is never found as a minimum, although it corresponds to a higher-energy extremum in the parameter region delimited by the grey area in Fig. 5. It may be either a maximum or a metastable state with a small basin of attraction.\nIn Fig. 9, we plot directly the four ai for various degenerate solutions (in blue solid circles). Numerically, the points are obtained by fixing the first distortion a1 to various exact values and let the other distortions relax in the minimization procedure. Fixing a1 is done here for representation purpose, so as to plot as a function of a phase \u03c6. The exact result for the 2-gap Ansatz is given by Eq. (98):\nai(\u03c6) = a\u0304 \u03d13(ic +\u03c6, q)\u03d13((i + 3)c +\u03c6, q) \u03d13((i + 1)c +\u03c6, q)\u03d13((i + 2)c +\u03c6, q)\n1/2\n, (128)\nfor i = 1, . . . , 4.

Since I2 = \u2211N i=1 ai\n2 is a function of q, the parameter of the \u03d13 function, q is numerically determined. Therefore, in the exact solution above, there is no free parameter left, except \u03c6 which reflects the continuous degeneracy, i.e. the one-parameter family of ground states. The four curves ai(\u03c6) are plotted in Fig. 9 and are in perfect agreement with the numerical results, thus confirming that the 2-gap Ansatz is the ground state at integrable points.\nTwo special configurations have to be noticed. First, note that a change of \u03c6 by \u03c6 + 1/4 corresponds to a translation of the bonds, so that in Fig. 9 the same translated configurations are found. At \u03c6 = 0 (or equivalently at \u03c6 = 14 , 1 2 , 3 4), the configuration consists of two neighboring short bonds of equal length (a trimer) followed by two long bonds of equal length. At \u03c6 = 18 = 0.125 (or at equivalent points), the configuration has a single short bond (a dimer) surrounded by two equal-length bonds, followed by a longer bond. As we have emphasized, these configurations are degenerate with many others.\nThe envelope function f , defined by Eq. (105), is thus directly obtained from Eq. (128). f is periodic with period 1, and continuous in this integrable case. It is represented by the solid line (for \u03bb= 2) in Fig. 10."

(129)\nWhen the ratio of length scales \u03bb \u0338= 2, the model does not depend solely on the {Im} and is no longer integrable. The minimization of W is therefore now exclusively numerical: the bond lengths {\u2113i} (or {ai}) are self-consistently determined numerically (see Appendix E).\nFor \u03bb < 2, we find the chain configuration shown in Fig. 11 (left): the four atoms are represented in their effective positions (atom 1 is fixed at the origin). The short bond (here between atoms 2 and 3) is represented by a thick line and corresponds to the formation of a dimer, where the pair of electrons ensures the covalent bonding: the unit-cell, shown by a dashed rectangle, is periodically repeated, giving a\nL1SL1 L2 L1SL1 L2 . . . (130)\nsequence, where L1 and L2 are two different long bonds and S is the short dimer bond. The electronic density is stronger on the two sites of the dimer, but nonzero elsewhere and is shown in Fig. 11 by the color code. Contrary to the integrable case, starting the minimization from many random configurations always leads to the same solution, up to the four translations (which move the strong bond to any one of the four bonds). The continuous degeneracy has been lifted and one of the solutions has now the lowest energy: the solution corresponds to a slight modification of the solution \u03c6 = 18 . The comparison is given in Fig. 9 where this solution is indicated by pink circles (the middle circle corresponds to the two equal distortions). Similarly, in Fig. 8, the new solution, instead of being continuously degenerate, corresponds to four discrete pink circles, which can exchanged thanks to the translational symmetry.\nIt is still possible to define an envelope function f , as explained in section 4.1. For c = 1/4, the numbers ic (mod 1) take only four values, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1 (= 0 (mod 1)), so that f can be defined only at those four points by f (1/4) = a1, f (1/2) = a2, f (3/4) = a3 and f (1) = a4. They are represented by the large pink points in Fig. 10. To define the function outside these points, consider the commensurabilities cm = (m + 1)/(4m + 3), in particular 11/43, 21/83, 31/123 which are closer and closer to c = 1/4. The points icm (mod 1) fill more and more densely the interval [0, 1] when m increases and a true envelope function can be defined by the limit of successive set of points and is represented by a dashed line in Fig. 10. At \u03bb= 1.99, that limiting function is not a continuous smooth curve but has clear abrupt steps. At \u03bb= 2, the envelope function, represented by a solid line in Fig. 10 is continuous. The lifting of the degeneracy away from integrable points is associated with the opening of discontinuities in the envelope function. An Aubry transition occurs abruptly at \u03bb = 2 in the commensurate case.\nFor \u03bb > 2, the situation is different: the degeneracy is also lifted but the structure selected is different (see Fig. 11, right). A trimer is formed with a sequence of bonds\nLSSLLSSL . . . , (131)\ni.e. two short (S) and two long (L) bonds repeating. The points a1, a2 are also shown in Fig. 8, they are slightly away from the degenerate manifold and at a different place than for \u03bb < 2. It is also reported in Fig. 9 by the red circles, and corresponds to the \u03c6 = 0 structure. The envelope function can be defined as in the previous paragraph and is also discontinuous.\nImportantly, in both cases, the continuous degeneracy is lifted and the structure, therefore, cannot be deformed continuously at constant energy. The gap at k = 0 (as in Fig. (12), right) is now open as in the 3-gap solution, but, with a difference in the configurations and no continuous degeneracy. Thus, in this generic case away from integrability, we find what one expects from general arguments: a definite set of distortions related by discrete symmetries, while all the gaps are opened and there is no degeneracy: the commensurate CDW is pinned. The integrable case at \u03bb= 2 thus appears as a special point where not only the two configurations at \u03bb < 2 and \u03bb > 2 become degenerate, but, also appears a continuous manifold of degenerate\nstates, thus allowing the structure to be continuously deformed at no energy cost. It has the peculiar property that a commensurate charge-density wave achieves Fr\u00f6hlich conductivity.\nTo show more clearly the lifting of the continuous degeneracy, we continuously deform the solutions. In this purpose, we fix the length of the strong bond to a given value \u2113 with \u2113min \u2264 \u2113 \u2264 \u2113max , where \u2113min is the length of the strongest bond (S) in the ground state and \u2113max that of a weaker bond (L or L1), and minimize the energy W numerically. For \u2113 = \u2113min or \u2113 = \u2113max , we have W = Wmin. In Fig 13, we plot the difference of energy W \u2212Wmin as a function of \u2113. For \u03bb = 2, we see that changing \u2113 in the specified range does not change the energy: this is the continuous degeneracy of the integrable case. For \u03bb \u0338= 2, the degeneracy is lifted and the energies of the intermediate configurations with \u2113min < \u2113 < \u2113max are higher. There is an energy barrier which is necessary to deform the CDW, called the Peierls-Nabarro barrier. Note that it can be weak near \u03bb = 2, since it continuously vanishes. To interpret its magnitude, it is interesting to compare with the dimer case. Consider three sites: sites 1 and 2 are separated by the vacuum length, \u21130 (defined in Eq. (11)) and site 3 is at a larger distance. What is the energy needed to transfer the first bond onto the second? In the limit when the total length becomes large enough, it is the energy corresponding to the separation of the two bound atoms (using Eq. (10) with \u2113= \u21130),\nW \u2212Wmin = 1\u2212 1\u03bb (\u03be\u03bb) 1 \u03bb\u22121 . (132)\nFor \u03bb = 1.9 and \u03be = 1 (as chosen in Fig. 13), one gets W \u2212Wmin = 0.2321, which is considerably larger than the magnitude of the barrier at p = 0.02. At larger pressures, when the Peierls gap becomes smaller, the barrier of the three site problem can be considerably smaller. The small amplitude shown in Fig. 13 is thus the result of a combination of large pressures and proximity to the integrable point (where the barrier vanishes)."

            "text": "Away from integrability when \u03bb is decreased to \u03bb= 1.9, one sees in Fig. 15 (bottom) that the envelope function is no longer continuous but has gaps at several places. This is the breaking of analyticity, which occurs in other similar models [41, 44, 45]. The chain configuration can be described in the limit of small pressure (e.g. p = 0.006). For a rational approximant c = r/N , there are r short bonds which form distinct local dimers or strong covalent bonds in the unit-cell of N sites (see Fig. (16) when c = 5/13). This explains the r lower distinct values of (\u2113i\u2212 \u2113\u0304)/\u2113\u0304 in Fig. 15 (bottom). The dimers occur in a special sequence (see Fig. (16)) which corresponds to a uniform structure (the definition of uniform structures is found in Ref. [59, 60]): this way, the pairs of electrons located on each dimer gain the most energy. This analysis only stands for low enough pressures. When the pressure increases, as shown in Fig. 17, the discontinuities in the envelope function decrease and vanish above some critical pressure. The envelope function becomes continuous in the incommensurate limit and the phase is sliding as in the integrable case. This is an Aubry transition from a high-pressure\nunpinned phase to a low-pressure pinned phase. It is similar to that occurring in the SSH model as function of pressure [41, 44] or electric field via an electromechanical effect [45]. The corresponding band structures are shown in Fig. 18: the main Peierls gap does not change much but the secondary gaps are clearly visible at small enough pressures. While the transition is an insulating to metal transition, the electronic gap remains open, but the deformation of the incommensurate CDW leads to Fr\u00f6hlich conductivity.\nThe order parameter of the Aubry transition can be taken as the main gap in the envelope function (as in Fig. 17). It is plotted as a function of pressure in Fig. 19. While it shows a smooth crossover for c = 5/13, one sees that the crossover is much sharper for c = 34/89, which indicates the onset of a transition in the incommensurate limit: the order parameter vanishes linearly with pressure (except for a very slow convergence of the minimization at the transition). The energy is, however, continuous at the transition (see the inset of Fig. 19). The Peierls-Nabarro barrier also vanishes at the transition. The barriers and their evolution as a function of pressure are shown in Fig. 20. As in the commensurate case, the barriers increase slowly in the pinned phase and remains much smaller than the zero-pressure limit.\nAt strong pressures, the length of the chain must be small and each bond is compressed. It turns out that not only the averaged bond length is small but the distortions around the average \u2113i \u2212 \u2113\u0304 = \u03b4\u2113i are small. For example, for p = 0.1, the result of the numerical minimization9 is given in Fig. 21. Both in the integrable and nonintegrable cases, we find a standard cosine CDW. In the integrable case, the exact solution can be expanded when q\u2192 0, by keeping the first term in the Fourier series of \u03d13(z, q) [Eq. (85)],\n\u2113i = \u2113\u0304+ u cos(2\u03c0ic +\u03c6) , (135)\nwhere u = 8q sin(\u03c0c) sin(2\u03c0c) \u2192 0 and \u03c6 a phase. The Peierls Ansatz is exact in this limit. Since u \u226a \u2113\u0304, the model can be expanded around a true metallic state and the perturbative approach summarized in section 2.4 is essentially correct.\n9Note that the numerics has to be done carefully, because on small chains, the minimization gives an undistorted metallic state as the ground state. It is necessary to increase the number of unit-cells, i.e. the number of k points, for the system to converge to a distorted state, as expected on general grounds [61].\nWhat makes the Peierls approach break down at smaller pressures with the emergence of discontinuities in the envelope function? This is precisely a regime where the nonlinearities in \u03b4\u2113i become important. When \u03b4\u2113i get larger, the Hamiltonian acquires a large modulated perturbation. The minimization equations (39) get larger nonlinear terms in \u03b4\u2113i and define real nonlinear maps. In these maps, the growing nonlinearities are eventually responsible for the destruction of the KAM tori. It is therefore not sufficient to treat the problem in perturbation theory, nor to restrict, as it is done in the standard Peierls approach, the effect of the modulated potential to the energy levels close to the Fermi energy. We have in particular observed that the whole spectrum is modified with respect to that of the metallic state (see e.g. Fig. 12). The linear response and the choice of the Peierls Ansatz obviously miss the nonlinear regime.\nAlthough it is difficult to represent the KAM tori in such high-dimensional phase-space, we show some sections of them by plotting ai+1 as a function of ai , i = 1, . . . , N , in Fig. 22. For \u03bb = 2 and a given pressure (Fig. 22 (left)), the set of points corresponding to the exact solution forms a regular \u201ctrajectory\u201d and corresponds to a section of the Liouville torus on which the solution takes place. When \u03bb = 1.9 (at the same pressure), one sees that the torus is destroyed. Similarly in Fig. 22, right, one sees the effect of the external pressure at nonintegrable points: regular trajectories corresponding to continuous solutions still exist, they\nare sections of the KAM tori, but eventually at smaller pressures, the KAM tori are destroyed. This is another representation of the Aubry transition, which emphasizes the connection with nonlinear dynamical systems.\nIt is also important to stress that the SSH Hamiltonian (see Fig. 1) is a linearized version of the BDK model but also exhibits an Aubry transition [41]. The energy and the minimization equations remain nonlinear in the local modulation amplitudes. However, the SSH model breaks down at strong couplings when the distortions become large enough: the hopping amplitude changes sign. The BDK model does not suffer such a setback: the hopping remains well-defined. This allows the chain to remain stable in the weak pressure regime where the averaged bond length and the modulation amplitudes get larger. Thus the chain can be connected to the zero pressure limit, where the atoms form isolated molecules: this is the \u201cantiintegrable\u201d limit (in the language of Aubry and Abramovici [57]) where the physics is local. This limit does not exist in the SSH model.\nNote, however, that, when the Aubry transition takes place, the amplitudes of the distortions can be much larger than experimentally observed: this suggests that the intrinsic pinning would occur at too strong energy scales. Pinned CDWs with much smaller amplitudes can be achieved in some other nonlinear models. Indeed, in order to get an Aubry transition, the nonlinearities need to be above a threshold: this does not imply that the distortions should\nbe large, only the local gradients. The local gradients can be sufficiently large if the Hamiltonian contains electron-lattice interactions that are strong nonlinear functions of the atomic distance. An example of such a model will be provided in a further publication [62]."

            "text": "While a 1D Peierls system develops a 2kF charge-density wave at low temperatures, the shape of its envelope function is an interesting issue, both theoretically and experimentally.10 We have emphasized here that the shape depends on the interaction terms and energy parameters and implies qualitative physical consequences.\nFirst, for the BDK model at integrable points, we have confirmed numerically that its ground-state is a cnoidal charge-density wave (1-gap state in the Toda case, 2-gap state in the Volterra case), as originally predicted [31]. The other g-gap Ans\u00e4tze, which develop more zero-energy phason modes, cannot be excluded for a generalized BDK model: we have investigated in details the example of the quarter-filled chain, and found that, although the g-gap states could be metastable, the cnoidal wave remains the ground state in that case. The BDK model thus provides an interesting example of a nonlinear model where the shape of the CDW can be explicitly calculated in a nonperturbative regime. It reduces to the Peierls cosine shape in the perturbative regime.\nSecond, when integrability is broken, we have explained that the commensurate phases are pinned, as expected on general grounds. The absence of pinning at integrable points and for the commensurate phases results from the fine-tuning of the model, which consists of defining a constant energy on a Liouville torus of the underlying classical integrable model.\n10The intensity of higher harmonics are measured in synchrotron X-ray diffractions (see [63]). It is possible to obtain some details about the local atomic structure through the atomic pair distribution function technique [18].\nNow, in the incommensurate case and thanks to KAM theorem, two situations arise:\n\u2022 At strong pressures, the bonds are contracted and their lengths weakly modulated. The resulting modulated potential implies weak nonlinearities in the ground state equations. There is no fundamental difference with the integrable case and this reflects the KAM theorem in the weak nonlinear regime. The envelope of the wave remains continuous and close to a cnoidal wave. The incommensurate CDW phase is sliding. It corresponds to a dynamical strong-pressure fixed-point and to Peierls-Fr\u00f6hlich phase.\n\u2022 At weak pressures, the bonds are elongated and more strongly modulated. The modulated potential being larger, the nonlinearities become important. The system enters the nonlinear stochastic regime in which the KAM tori are broken. The envelope function of the wave is discontinuous. The CDW phase is intrinsically pinned. Atoms tend to form some oligomers (like dimer or trimer local structures): the system has evolved towards an \u201canti-integrable\u201d limit. It corresponds to a dynamical weak-pressure fixed point. Many metastable states with local defects emerge at higher energies.\nIn the incommensurate case, an Aubry transition (which is not a crossover) takes place between these two regimes. This is a form of transition to chaos in which Liouville (KAM) tori of the integrable model are destroyed [40]. The resulting pinning of these states appears as an intrinsic nonlinear mechanism. In this case, the Peierls approach breaks down because the modulated potential is strong and must be treated nonperturbatively: the band structure is strongly affected as a whole, even far from the Fermi energy, which is confirmed by some recent experimental results [14]. These states with discontinuous envelope functions could explain the observed charge-density waves and their pinning. Eventually, the exact states with\ncontinuous envelope functions found in the BDK model at integrable points do not exhaust the physical possibilities of Peierls systems."

Eqs. (B.7) and (B.4) form coupled nonlinear equations for {ai} (or {\u2113i}) and {bi}.\nC Energy gradients, explicit example of c = 1/4\nWe illustrate the derivation of the energy gradients \u03b4W/\u03b4Im in the Volterra case at quarterfilling, c = 1/4, for which the periodicity of the chain is N = 4.\nWe have seen that to obtain the energy bands and the characteristic polynomial of H(k), it is convenient to define the polynomial Q(E), Eq. (21), which writes, for N = 4,\nQ(E) = A0(E 4 \u2212 I2E2 \u2212 I4) . (C.1)\nIt only involves even powers of E (giving a E\u2192\u2212E symmetry), so the only nonzero Im terms are\nI2 = a1 2 + a2 2 + a3 2 + a4 2 , (C.2)\nI4 = \u2212a22a42 \u2212 a12a32 , (C.3) C4 = a1a2a3a4 . (C.4)\nWe use also A0 = 1\n2C4 and C4 = 1 16 e \u2212 I02 . A generic example of plot of Q(E) is given in Fig. (3) (a).\nBecause the model makes sense only when \u2113i > 0, i.e. ai = 1 2 e \u2212 \u2113i2 < 12 , the coefficients follow\n0< I2 < 1 , \u2212 1 8 < I4 < 0 , 0< C4 < 1 16 . (C.5)\nFor N = 4, we can explicitly solve the algebraic equation,\nQ(E) = cos kN . (C.6)\nThe solutions are the four energy bands (supposing I22 \u2265 4(\u2212I4 + 2C4)):\nE\u03bd(k) = \u00b1\n\u221a \u221a1 2 I2 \u00b1 q I22 + 4(I4 + 2C4 cos4k) . (C.7)\nA plot of the energy bands is given in Fig. 3 (b): the four bands are separated by three gaps. They are symmetric with respect to E = 0, thanks to the special symmetry mentioned above. Note that the energy bands are expressed in terms of I2, I4, C4.\nAt c = 1/4, the lowest band (\u03bd= 1) is filled and the others empty. One wants to minimize the generalized BDK energy,\nW = 1 S \u2211\nk\nE1(k) + 2 \u2211\nm=0\n\u03be2m I2m , (C.8)\nThe model parameters are \u03be0 = 1 2 p, \u03be2 = \u03be and \u03be4. The gradient of the energy writes\n\u03b4W = 1 S \u2211\nk\n\u03b4E1(k) + 2 \u2211\nm=0\n\u03be2m\u03b4I2m . (C.9)\nWe follow the same procedure than that leading to Eq. (50) and get\n1 S \u2211\nk\n\u03b4E1(k) = 2 \u2211\nm=0\nJ2m\u03b4I2m , (C.10)\nwhere\nJ0 = \u2212 1\n2S\n\u2211\nk\nQ(E1(k)) Q\u2032(E1(k)) , (C.11)\nJ2 = 1 S \u2211\nk\nA0E1(k)2 Q\u2032(E1(k)) , (C.12)\nJ4 = \u2212 1 S \u2211\nk\nA0 Q\u2032(E1(k)) , (C.13)\nwhich are sums over k in the first Brillouin zone. J0, J2 and J4 are functions of I0, I2 and I4. With these definitions, Eq. (C.9) writes\n\u03b4W = 2 \u2211\nm=0\n(J2m + \u03be2m)\u03b4I2m , (C.14)\nEventually, the energy gradients are given by\n\u03b4W \u03b4I2m = J2m + \u03be2m , \u2200m= 0, 1,2 . (C.15)\nD Energy gradients for g-gap Ans\u00e4tze\nIn this appendix, we find the expression of the gradient of the energy of the integrable model for the special g-gap Ans\u00e4tze. The general expression Eq. (50) can be expressed in terms of the remaining independent \u03b4Im, leading to Eq. (64).\nSuppose that the spectrum has g gaps (instead of N \u22121), which means that N \u22121\u2212 g gaps are accidentally closed. In other words, the polynomial of degree 2N ,\nR2N (E) = 1\u2212Q(E)2 , (D.1)\nthe zeros of which gives the energy of the band edges, has N \u2212 1\u2212 g double roots, ei (which correspond to degenerate band edges). It can be written,\nR2N (E) = P2g+2(E) N\u22121\u2212g \u220f\ni=1\n(E \u2212 ei)2 , (D.2)\nwhere P2g+2(E) is a polynomial of degree 2g + 2. On the other hand, each closed gap (corresponding to a double root ei) gives a relation of the form (Eq. 61), N \u2211\nm=0\nlm(ei)\u03b4Im = 0 , (D.3)\nwhere\nl0(E) \u2261 \u2212 1 2 Q(E) , (D.4)\nlm(E) \u2261 A0EN\u2212m , \u2200m\u2265 1 . (D.5)\nThe double roots can then be factorized out of the polynomial,\nN \u2211\nm=0\nlm(E)\u03b4Im = g+1 \u2211\nm=0\n\u03b4AmE m\nN\u22121\u2212g \u220f\ni=1\n(E \u2212 ei) , (D.6)\nwhere the \u03b4Am can be explicitly obtained by expanding and identifying the coefficients of the successive powers of E, from EN , EN\u22121 down to EN\u2212g\u22121,\n\u2212 1 2 A0\u03b4I0 = \u03b4Ag+1 , (D.7)\nA0\u03b4I1 \u2212 1 2\nA0 I1\u03b4I0 = \u03b4Ag \u2212\u03b4Ag+1 N\u2212g\u22121 \u2211\nj=1\ne j , (D.8)\n. . .\nA0\u03b4Ig+1 \u2212 1 2\nA0 Ig+1\u03b4I0 = g+1 \u2211\nm=0\n\u03b1m\u03b4Am . (D.9)\nThis system of g+2 equations is directly invertible thanks to its triangular form. For example, one finds that \u03b4Ag+1 is simply proportional to \u03b4I0 from the upper equation. Then, from the second equation, \u03b4Ag is a linear combination of \u03b4I0 and \u03b4I1, etc. down to \u03b4A0, which is a linear combination of all \u03b4Im from m= 0 to g + 1. One finds that\n\u03b4Am = g+1 \u2211\nj=0\n\u03b2m, j\u03b4I j , (D.10)\nfor m = 0, . . . , g + 1. \u03b4Am are thus linear combinations of, at most, g + 2 independent \u03b4Im. We have \u03b2m, j = 0 for j +m> g + 1 and, using s1 = \u2211 j e j and s2 = \u2211 i \u0338= j eie j ,\n\u03b2g+1,0 = \u2212 1 2 A0 , (D.11)\n\u03b2g,0 = \u2212 1 2 A0(I1 + s1) , \u03b2g,1 = A0 , (D.12)\n\u03b2g\u22121,0 = \u2212 1 2 A0[(I1 + s1)s1 + s2 + I2] , \u03b2g\u22121,1 = A0s1 , \u03b2g\u22121,2 = A0 , etc. (D.13)\nWhen the system has only g gaps, the gradient of the electronic energy, given by Eq. (50), simplifies, thanks to Eqs. (D.2) and (D.6), into\n\u03b4Eelec =\n\u222b\ndE\n\u2211g+1 m=0\u03b4AmE m\n\u00c6 P2g+2(E) . (D.14)\nBy using Eq. (D.10), we get (renote the indices)\n\u03b4Eelec = g+1 \u2211\nm=0\nGm\u03b4Im , (D.15)\nwhere\nGm =\n\u222b\ndE gm(E) \u00c6\nP2g+2(E) , (D.16)\ngm(E) = g+1 \u2211\nj=0\n\u03b2 j,mE j , (D.17)\nwhich is the expression given in Eq. (64). If the number of gaps corresponds to the generic case, g = N \u2212 1, the expression reduces to (50). When g < N \u2212 1, thanks to the dependency relation, the gradient (D.15) can be expressed as a sum over the g + 2 independent variables \u03b4Im only."

It is equivalent to solving a first-order (overdamped) dynamical equation of motion\n\u2202 x i \u2202 t = \u2212 \u03b4W \u03b4x i . (E.2)\nWhile this method allows one to find a local minimum, it is possible to find distinct minima starting from random configurations, i.e. exploring the phase space.\nIn the present problem, one needs to minimize the energy W which is a function of {ai} (or {\u2113i}) and possibly {bi}. The respective gradients \u03b4W/\u03b4bi and \u03b4W/\u03b4\u2113i are calculated in Appendix B. Numerically, they are computed as follows. Let us introduce the Bloch wave function |\u03a8\u03bd(k)\u232a with mode \u03bd having energy E\u03bd(k) and complex amplitude \u03c8i,\u03bd(k), one gets\n\u2211\n\u03c3\n\u2329c\u2020i\u03c3ci\u03c3\u232a= 2 \u2211\nk,\u03bdocc.\n|\u03c8i,\u03bd(k)|2 , (E.3)\nwhere the factor 2 comes from the spin degeneracy. The sum is up to the Fermi energy (the sums over k are performed numerically and using the k\u2192\u2212k symmetry). The gradient (B.3) writes\n\u03b4W \u03b4bi = 1 S \u2211\nk,\u03bdocc.\n|\u03c8i,\u03bd(k)|2 + \u03be\nS bi . (E.4)\nSimilarly for the second gradient (B.6), one finds\n\u03b4W \u03b4\u2113i = 1 S ai \u2211\nk,\u03bdocc.\nRe[\u03c8\u2217i+1,\u03bd(k)\u03c8i,\u03bd(k)]\u2212 \u03bb\n2S \u03beai\n\u03bb + p\n2S . (E.5)\nThese quantities are computed by diagonalizing the matrix. To get the local extremum, the variables are updated according to\nb\u2032i = bi \u2212 \u03b4W \u03b4bi \u03b4t , (E.6) \u2113\u2032i = \u2113i \u2212 \u03b4W \u03b4\u2113i \u03b4t , (E.7)\nuntil the gradients are smaller than a given threshold, typically 10\u22127. The number of iterations needed to reach this precision depends on the parameters, and varies from 104 to 106 near the Aubry transition where the convergence is slow.\nF Definitions of Jacobi \u03d1n(z, q)-functions\nJacobi \u03d1n(z, q)-functions are important analytic functions which play a special role in the theory of elliptic functions (see, for instance, Ref. [64]). In particular, Jacobi \u03d13(z, q) function is defined by its Fourier series,\n\u03d13(z, q) = +\u221e \u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e e2i\u03c0nzqn 2 = 1+ 2\n+\u221e \u2211\nn=1\nqn 2 cos(2\u03c0nz) , (F.1)\nwith z \u2208 C. q is a complex parameter, called the nome, and such that |q|< 1 to ensure that the series converges. The parameter q is sometimes noted q = ei\u03c0\u03c4, where \u03c4 is a complex number in the upper half-plane, \u2111m(\u03c4) > 0, so that |q| < 1. Higher harmonics become rapidly small when |q| \u2192 0. By a direct calculation, one finds that, for n and m integers,\n\u03d13(z + n, q) = \u03d13(z, q) , (F.2) \u03d13(z +m\u03c4, q) = e \u2212i\u03c0m2\u03c4\u22122i\u03c0mz\u03d13(z, q) . (F.3)\nThe function \u03d13 is periodic with period 1 (by definition) but not elliptic. One finds that \u03d13( 1+\u03c4 2 , q) = 0 and that the only zeros of the function are off the real axis (because the imaginary part of \u03c4 is strictly nonzero). In this paper, we are only interested in z \u2208 R and q \u2208 R. Some examples of plots of \u03d13(z, q) are given in Fig. 23 for q = 0,0.1, 0.5,0.9.\nWhen q is small, one finds\n\u03d13(z, q) = 1+ 2q cos(2\u03c0nz) +O(q4) , (F.4)\nand so \u03d13 is very close to a cosine modulation with amplitude 2q. When q increases, the modulation amplitude around 1 increases, and the shape is deformed, becoming more and more localized around zero (and, by periodicity, around any integer). \u03d13(z, q) never strictly vanishes for z \u2208 R, since its zeros are in the complex plane.\nOther Jacobi \u03d1n(z, q)-functions are defined by\n\u03d11(z, q) = e i\u03c0\u03c4/4+i\u03c0(z+1/2)\u03d13(z + 1 2 + \u03c4 2 , q)\n= q 1 4 ei\u03c0(z+1/2)[1+ 2\n+\u221e \u2211\nn=1\n(\u22121)nqn 2+n cos(2\u03c0nz)] , (F.5)\n\u03d12(z, q) = e i\u03c0\u03c4/4+i\u03c0z\u03d13(z +\n\u03c4 2 , q) , (F.6)\n\u03d14(z, q) = \u03d13(z + 1 2\n, q) = 1+ 2 +\u221e \u2211\nn=1\n(\u22121)nqn 2 cos(2\u03c0nz) .
