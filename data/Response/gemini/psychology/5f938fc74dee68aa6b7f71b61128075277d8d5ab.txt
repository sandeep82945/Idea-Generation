1. **Investigate the effects of varying the length and composition of the appended peptide blocks on the optical properties of ALucs.** This could be done by creating a series of ALucs with different lengths and compositions of appended peptide blocks and characterizing their BL intensities, spectra, and colors. This information could be used to design ALucs with specific optical properties for different applications.


2. **Explore the use of ALucs in bioassays and molecular imaging.** The new ALucs could be used to develop a variety of bioassays and molecular imaging probes. For example, ALucs could be used to create single-chain molecular strain probes, PCA probes, and FRET-based sensors. These probes could be used to study protein-protein interactions, enzyme activities, and other cellular processes.


3. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the BL intensity and spectral variations of ALucs.** This could be done using a combination of experimental and computational techniques. The results of these studies could provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of luciferases and help to design ALucs with improved optical properties.


4. **Develop new methods for fabricating ALucs.** The current method for fabricating ALucs is based on the alignment of existing ALuc sequences. However, this method is limited by the availability of existing ALuc sequences. New methods for fabricating ALucs could be developed that are not limited by this constraint. These methods could be used to create ALucs with novel optical properties and applications.


5. **Explore the use of ALucs in other applications.** ALucs could potentially be used in a variety of other applications, such as drug discovery, environmental monitoring, and food safety. The unique optical properties of ALucs make them well-suited for these applications.
