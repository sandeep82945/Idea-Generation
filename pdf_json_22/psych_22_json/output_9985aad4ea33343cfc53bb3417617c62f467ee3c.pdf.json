    "abstractText": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that results from complex interactions of multiple genes and environmental risk and adversity factors. Some researchers have suggested a need for additional research into differing clinical presentations of ADHD for further classification. In this context, this study aimed to investigate whether increases in risk and adversity factors increase the severity of ADHD and the number of comorbid psychiatric disorders. This is a naturalistic retrospective chart review exploratory study in 100 patients 16 years or older who have a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS, using the Mann\u2013Whitney test for parametric data and the Chi-square and Kruskal\u2013Wallis p value tests for non-parametric and categorical data. Qualitative data were tabulated and described. The study found that (1) the average number of comorbidities increases with the severity of ADHD, (2) the average number of risk and adversity factors increases with the severity of ADHD, (3) the number of risk and adversity factors were positively associated with the number of comorbidities, and (4) Level of education was negatively associated with the number of risk and adversity factors and the number of comorbidities. The implications of these findings are discussed, and future research in this important area is suggested.",

            "text": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects around 6% of children and adolescents and 3% of adults worldwide. ADHD can present as challenges in sustained attention, motor hyperactivity, and enhanced impulsivity. In addition, throughout an individual\u2019s lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk and adversity of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents and injuries, criminality, social difficulties, and substance use disorders. ADHD does not have one direct cause; instead, it results from complex interactions of multiple genes and environmental risk and adversity factors [1]. While it is generally accepted that the disorder is highly heritable (>70%), it is estimated that between 10 and 40% of the variance associated with ADHD is likely to be accounted for by environmental factors [2]. ADHD has been associated with various risk and adversity factors, but most of these associations have yet to be shown as causal. Prematurity\u2014especially extreme prematurity\u2014 maternal smoking or substance use during pregnancy, low Apgar scores at 5 min, low birth weight, and other labor/delivery complications are associated with ADHD [2]. Several general psychosocial adversity factors have been studied concerning ADHD [2,3]. Among the factors associated with ADHD are low parental education, low income and poverty, deprivation, hostile parenting, bullying, adverse parenting practices, peer victimization, and family discord [3\u201320]. A meta-analysis of the dimensions of SES and their\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 919. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12070919 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 919 2 of 12\nassociation with ADHD indicate that children in families of low socioeconomic status (SES) are, on average, 1.85\u20132.21 times more likely to have ADHD [21]. ADHD-related difficulties with higher-order cognitive processes affect encoding and utilization of expectations regarding the effects of marijuana [22]. Compared with children without ADHD, children with ADHD have higher Adverse Childhood Experience exposure. In addition, a significant correlation has been observed between adverse childhood experiences and moderate to severe levels of ADHD [23]. Comorbidities are characterized by more than one specific condition in an individual and are common among psychiatric disorders. Approximately 75% of persons with ADHD have an additional mental disorder, and around 60% have multiple comorbid mental disorders [24]. High rates of comorbidities with ADHD have been reported in both clinical samples and epidemiological studies [25]. Authors have indicated that comorbidity is generally high in ADHD in both children and adults. Comorbid disorders may share common vulnerability, genetic, or psychosocial adversity factors. They may present as a separate entity or as an expression of phenotypic variability [26,27]. Researchers continue to attempt to find additional subtypes of ADHD, such as Sluggish Cognitive Tempo described by Barkley [28]. Some researchers indicate a need for further research to investigate the association of the risk and adversity factors, comorbidities, and clinical profiles in ADHD [29]\u2014notably since earlier studies suggested that certain risk and adversity factors are associated with a specific subtype of ADHD in genetically susceptible individuals [30]. ADHD is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder. The neurodevelopmental theory holds that a disruption of normal brain development in utero or during early life underlies the subsequent development of symptoms later in life [31]. Recent research on a neurovisceral integration model (NVI) has proposed that physiological, emotional, and cognitive regulation processes are related to each other in the control of behavior and adaptability [32]. The results of functional imaging studies in ADHD indicate multiple abnormalities not limited to the frontal\u2013striatal circuitry\u2014which is crucial for executive/motivational function\u2014but also includes the parietal, temporal, and motor cortex, as well as the cerebellum [33,34]. The ventral striatum, including the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and the putamen, shows lower activation during reward anticipation in ADHD than in controls\u2014this may be related to hyperactive\u2013impulsive symptom severity rather than inattention [35\u201337]. Questions are raised about the role of additional metabolic pathways such as the tryptophan (TRP)\u2013Kynurenine (KYN) pathway in different psychiatric disorders [38]. The brain\u2019s executive system is hypothesized to control inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility\u2014particularly when more complex demands require adaptation and effortful control [39\u201341]. The complexity of the pathophysiology of ADHD as a neurodevelopmental disorder creates additional importance for research on risk factors and comorbidities."

When looking at the three subtypes of ADHD, if Mild/Moderate Severity (N = 52), 13 (25%) exhibited the Combined type, 6 (11.5%) exhibited the Hyperactive/Impulsive type, and 33 (63.5%) exhibited the\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 919 8 of 12\nInattentive type; whereas, if Severe (N = 48), 30 (62.5%) exhibited the Combined type, 3 (6.3%) exhibited the Hyperactive/Impulsive type and 15 (31.3%) exhibited the Inattentive type. Overall, these findings exhibited a p value of 0.0008. When comparing the severity of ADHD to the ADHD subtype, the Inattentive type was most likely to exhibit Mild/Moderate severity (63.5%). The Combined type was more likely to exhibit severe ADHD (62.5%). The hyperactive\u2013impulsive type was exhibited the least out of the total population (N = 9) and did not show much significance. However, all 13 of the listed adversity factors indicated in Table 5 were more likely to be exhibited by a participant with seven or more adversity factors than six or fewer adversity factors.\nThe risk and adversity factors of smoking and not being liked by teachers were the only two risk and adversity factors significantly associated with the severity of symptoms. For smoking, if Mild/Moderate severity (N = 52), 9 (17.3%) were smokers\u2014whereas if Severe (N = 48), 24 (50%) were smokers, with a p value of 0.0005. For not being liked by teachers if Mild, Moderate Severity (N = 52), 8 (15.4%) were not liked by teachers\u2014whereas if Severe (N = 48), 21 (43.8%) were not liked by teachers, with a p value of 0.0018 (Table 6)."

            "text": "This study was beneficial in investigating not only the developmental predisposing risk and adversity factors for ADHD such as birth complications, but also other perpetuating adversity factors such as substance use and self-harm. The study was designed to have a naturalistic sample from a specialized ADHD clinic and linked the risk and adversity factors with comorbid disorders and the severity of the ADHD presentation. Risk and adversity factors such as delayed developmental milestones may be genetic, environmental, or combined, so separating genetic from environmental risks and adversity was not evident in this study; certainly, the importance of genetic risk and adversity factors on the development of ADHD has been highlighted in several previous studies in the literature [27,36]. Our hypothesis for this study was that the higher the number of risk and adversity factors, the more severe the clinical profile in ADHD, as manifested by the number of ADHD symptoms and the number of comorbid disorders. As per the evidence indicated in Tables 3\u20135, this hypothesis is supported. The data is consistent with previous studies regarding several ADHD risk and adversity factors and comorbidities. In this study, bullying was our most prevalent adversity factor, with 81% of our participants having experienced it. It is suggested that greater emotional reactivity, social skill difficulties, and impulsive behaviors associated with individuals with ADHD can elicit negative reactions from peers and place them at greater risk of adversity, rejection, and victimization. Several studies have supported this finding [20].\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 919 9 of 12\nSocioeconomic disadvantage (40%) and Marijuana use (42%) were also some of our most prevalent adversity factors found; their association with ADHD had been previously noted in research carried out by Russell and colleagues (2016) [21] and Harty and colleagues (2015) [22], respectively. Children in families of low socioeconomic status (SES) are on average 1.85\u20132.21 more likely to have ADHD than their peers in high SES families. The meta-analysis showed evidence of this association despite the between-study heterogeneity [21]. Comorbid generalized anxiety is common with ADHD, and in this sample the high prevalence may reflect a peak in anxiety related to the COVID pandemic in 2021. The high number of patients who reported self-harm may reflect different comorbidities such as mood disorders, borderline personality disorder, and impulsive behavior. One interesting result was the negative relationship between the level of education and the number of risk and adversity factors. Education level was collected as part of the demographic information; higher numbers of risk factors were related to lower levels of education. ADHD has a distinct impact on academic adversity beyond the effects related to the influence of personal (e.g., sociodemographic, personality, prior achievement, specific learning disorder, motivation) and contextual (e.g., school issues) factors. ADHD may compound difficulties with academic outcomes through its effect on cognitive and executive functioning, self-regulation, or other ADHD-related behavior such as poor task completion and off-task behavior [32]. Although poor academic functioning is well documented in ADHD research, our specific finding may have importance in future strategies to improve educational outcomes in patients with ADHD. Despite the trend of higher numbers of risk and adversity factors being associated with lower levels of education that was evident in our raw data, a larger sample size will be required to confirm the statistical significance of these interesting findings. Some adversity factors such as not being liked by teachers were related to severe ADHD presentation. This interesting finding should be investigated further as teachers may have important effects on different stages of development and the formation of healthy self-esteem. The growing awareness of mood and anxiety disorders comorbid with ADHD as a neurodevelopmental disorder indicates that the boundaries between neurodevelopmental and non-neurodevelopmental disorders are ambiguous. Some researchers question if the comorbidities are related to the ADHD or to its risk factors [42]. In our study, the majority of patients with the combined subtype had seven or more adversity factors, whereas patients with the predominantly inattentive type had six or fewer risk factors. Children with predominantly inattentive ADHD are more passive, less aggressive, less assertive, and less knowledgeable of appropriate social behavior than those diagnosed with combined ADHD. They may be socially neglected, versus the combined type who are socially rejected [33]."

            "text": "This study highlighted the impact of risk and adversity factors in patients with ADHD\u2014particularly that they were associated with symptom severity, comorbidities, and education level. Results showed that the average number of comorbidities increased with the severity of ADHD, as did the average number of risk factors; moreover, the number of risk factors positively correlated with the number of comorbidities, but level of education negatively correlated with the number of risk factors and the number of comorbidities. There may be a distinct profile in patients with ADHD who have severe symptoms, multiple comorbidities, and seven or more risk factors. This specific group may require different management strategies and resources. Designing screening tools for patients with low academic achievements and multiple risk factors might be helpful for detecting comorbidities and distinct ADHD profiles.\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 919 10 of 12"

            "text": "This study has several limitations. One of the limitations of this study is the retrospective nature of the chart review; recall bias can be a limiting factor. Since participants fill out the intake form when they come into the clinic for their appointment, it requires them to think back to many experiences they had in the past, such as \u201cbeing bullied, sexual abuse before age 15, performance in school, etc.\u201d However, the nature and intensity of these adversity factors make recall bias less prevalent. Another limitation is the sample size of the study. Since it is an exploratory study, we have a smaller sample size (100), which limits the analysis of some of the findings. The male to female ratio is opposite to the natural prevalence of ADHD; however, it represents a new, naturalistic trend of more females seeking ADHD assessments. Among the limitations of this study is the lack of an assessment of proactive inhibitory control. More research with a larger sample is needed in patients with ADHD and multiple comorbidities. Future studies may also wish to investigate the effect of mitigating adversity factors in patients with ADHD, and whether specific management approaches would be more helpful for certain ADHD severities or subtypes. Future research could adapt this study in a larger sample size to allow for more valid findings. There is a clear need for further research in specific areas such as personality disorders, suicide prevention, and ADHD.\nAuthor Contributions: B.S. collected the data and submitted the ethics approval and started the draft manuscript.
