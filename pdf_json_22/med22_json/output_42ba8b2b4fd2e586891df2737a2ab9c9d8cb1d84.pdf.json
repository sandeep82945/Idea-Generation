            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "Because of elevated temperatures and ever-increasing human population, depletion of available water resources is becoming a serious threat to the agricultural sector worldwide (Wang et al., 2003). Plants experience numerous distractions in their phenotypical, physiological, and metabolic levels, leading to reduced growth and productivity under water-deficient conditions (Liu et al., 2013a; Cui et al., 2017). Among physiological functions, photosynthesis occupies the core importance, and previous studies have reported that plants under water-deficit stress often experience loss of turgor, stomatal closure, a decline in carbon dioxide assimilation, chlorophyll degradation, and a significant decrease in net photosynthetic rate (Pn) (Xu et al., 2008; Soares-Cordeiro et al., 2009). When plants suffer from water-deficit stress, disequilibrium between excitation and utilization of electrons during photosynthesis results in massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g., OH\u2212, O\u22122 , and H2O2), which are responsible for enhanced electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation (Reddy et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2015). Many studies have shown that there exists a close relationship between photochemical efficiency of photosystem II and ROS metabolism during the photooxidation process (Van Kooten and Snel, 1990; Wang et al., 2006). Moreover, ROS impart serious oxidative damage to membranes of numerous cell organelles, metabolites, and tissues including carbohydrates, lipids, enzymes, proteins, RNA, or DNA, thus accelerating programmed cell death (Gill and Tuteja, 2010). Plant tolerance and adaption to unfavorable environmental conditions demand adequate composition and organization of cellular membranes such as alteration in lipidomic profile (Ladjal et al., 2000). Maintenance of membrane stability, fluidity, and integrity increases plants\u2019 aptitude to diverse abiotic stresses (Gasulla et al., 2013). Previous studies have reported that reprogramming of membrane lipids was an effective strategy for plants against adverse environmental stresses (Vigh et al., 2005; Degenkolbe et al., 2012).\nPhospholipids (Phls) are primary constituents of extraplastidic membranes, and they not only take part in structural functions but also play a crucial role as signaling molecules in plants (Skinner et al., 2005). Bilayerprone phosphatidylcholine (PC) and nonbilayer-prone phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the most abundant Phl classes in extra-chloroplast membranes associated with membrane stability and integrity (Norberg and Liljenberg, 1991; Larsson et al., 2006). In addition, extra-chloroplast membranes also contain various other Phl classes in varying quantities,\nsuch as phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS), performing vital roles in biosynthesis pathways of other lipid classes and stress signaling (Larsson et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013b). Many studies have reported that the production of various signaling lipids including PI and phosphatidic acid (PA) was amplified in plants responding to environmental stresses such as high temperature, water deficiency, and osmotic stress, which regulated downstream signaling pathways contributing to physiological functions (Cowan, 2006; Munnik and Vermeer, 2010; Testerink and Munnik, 2011; Chen et al., 2018b).\nGlycolipids (Glls) are another important group of lipids performing imperative functions in cell membrane stability and integrity. Among Glls, DGDG and MGDG are the chief constituents of photosystem II (PSII) and play a vital role in thylakoid membrane establishment and photochemical efficiency of PSII (Mizusawa and Wada, 2012). DGDG and PC exhibit bilayer-forming attributes, whereas MGDG and PE are prone to forming non-bilayer phases called hexagonal phases (Aronsson et al., 2008). Therefore, higher PC/PE and DGDG/MGDG ratios are believed to be important indicators of enhanced membrane stability and fluidity (Narayanan et al., 2016). The study of Chen et al. (2018a) has found that a maize (Zea mays) cultivar with higher DGDG content and DGDG/MGDG ratio in leaves maintained better chloroplast membrane stability and delayed leaf senescence than the other cultivar under water-deficit stress (Chen et al., 2018a). Moreover, several studies published earlier reported that a higher DGDG/MGDG ratio is associated with plant adaption to adverse environmental conditions such as water-deficit, salinity, and heat stress (Torres-Franklin et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2019). In addition to DGDG and MGDG, SQDG, an anionic lipid species in thylakoid membranes, is involved in the regulation of PSI and PSII under abiotic stresses (Sato, 2004; Kobayashi, 2016). Tolerant genotypes of wheat (Triticum aestivum) accumulated higher SQDG content than susceptible genotypes when subjected to water stress, which indicated a beneficial function of SQDG in plants under water-deficit conditions (Quartacci et al., 1995).\nSphingolipids (Spls) are an extremely complicated and diverse group of lipids that occur in a wide range of organisms such as fungi, viruses, plants, and animals (Sperling and Heinz, 2003). Spls constitute up to 40% of all lipid groups of cell membranes associated with ionic permeability and structural integrity of membrane (Markham et al., 2013). Synthesis of Spls initiates as a result of serine and palmitoyl-CoA condensation regulated by serine palmitoyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum (Hanada, 2003). Different types of Spls are richly available in cell membranes, including long-chain bases\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879331\n(LCBs), long-chain base phosphates (LCBPs), and compound sphingolipids, such as ceramide (Cer), glucosylceramide (GlcCer), glycosylinositolphosphoceramide (GIPC), and hydroxyceramide (hCer) (Markham et al., 2013). The study of Zhou et al. (2016) revealed that Spls played positive roles in resistance to chilling stress in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. However, potential functions and mechanisms associated with changes in Spl content and composition have not been well-understood in plants under abiotic stress, especially in response to water-deficit stress.\nIn the agricultural sector, diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6), a novel synthetic plant growth regulator (PGR), has been widely utilized for many commercial crops including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), cotton (Gossypiumhirsutum), soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays), pakchoi (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis), and peanut (Arachishypogaea) since the last decade because of its promising effects on improving seed germination, early seedling establishment, chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthetic performance, carbon and oxygen metabolism, and biomass accumulation in many plant species under favorable and unfavorable conditions (Yu et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2012; Qi et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2020). Regulatory mechanisms of stress tolerance induced by DA-6 have been demonstrated in different plant species. For example, the application of DA-6 alleviated the adverse effects of lead (Pb) on perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) by decreasing Pb migration and compartmentalizing Pb into the cell wall and the vacuole (He et al., 2013). DA-6 effectively detoxified cadmium (Cd) toxicity in Amaranthus hybridus by retaining Cd in the cell wall (Li et al., 2018). Salt-induced damage in Cassia obtusifolia seedlings could be mitigated by DA-6 application because of enhanced osmolyte accumulation, photosynthesis, and antioxidant defense (Zhang et al., 2016). Our recent study also demonstrated that DA-6 improved the seed germination of white clover (Trifolium repens) by mediation of endogenous hormones, amylolysis, and dehydrin accumulation under water stress (Hassan et al., 2021). However, how reprogramming lipid profile is linked with DA-6-induced drought resistance has not been investigated in plants so far. The objectives of this study were to investigate genotypic variations in drought resistance of white clover, which is an important cool-season leguminous plant for forage, for ground cover, and as an ornament, to determine the effect of DA-6 application on oxidative damage, osmotic adjustment, and photosynthesis, and to further elucidate how primary lipid groups (glycolipids, phospholipids, and sphingolipids) and their ratio and unsaturation levels influenced by DA-6 treatment contribute to membrane stability, integrity, and fluidity under water-deficit stress. This study will provide a deep insight into the regulatory role of DA-6 in different physiological functions and lipid metabolism conferring drought resistance in plants."

The seeds were watered daily with distilled water for 7 days, and Hoagland\u2019s solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950) was used as a nutrient source of irrigation for the next 23 days. Before the onset of water-deficit stress, 30 days-old plants were pretreated by foliar application of 1.5mM of DA-6 solution or distilled water for 3 days so that white clover plants could absorb sufficient DA-6 or an equal amount of distilled water. Four different treatments were set up for each cultivar: (1) plants were cultivated in Hoagland\u2019s solution as the control (C); (2) plants were pretreated with DA-6 and then cultivated in Hoagland\u2019s solution (C+DA-6); (3) plants were cultivated in 17% PEG 6000 (\u22120.3 Mpa) Hoagland\u2019s solution as water-deficit stress (P); (4) plants were pretreated with DA-6 and then cultivated in 17% PEG 6000 Hoagland\u2019s solution (P+DA-6).

The two cultivars did not show significant difference in leaf RWC when exposed to exogenous DA-6 application under normal conditions. Leaf RWC declined progressively as the duration of water stress was prolonged in both cultivars; however, DA-6-pretreated plants maintained significantly higher RWC under water-deficit stress (Figures 1A,B). Leaf OA and WUE were determined on day 9 of water-deficit stress when phenotypic differences were most obvious (Figures 1C,D). Leaf OA in DA-6 pretreated and untreated plants decreased significantly under water-deficit stress. In both cultivars, a minimum OP value of \u22120.86 and \u22120.9 was recorded for Ladino and Riverdel pretreated with DA-6 under water stress (Figures 1C,D). In addition, waterdeficit stress decreased the WUE of both cultivars compared to respective controls. Riverdel maintained higher WUE than Ladino under water-deficient conditions. In Ladino, the exogenous application of DA-6 significantly mitigated the water deficit-induced decrease in WUE by 29.57% (Figure 1D).\nThe leaf Chl content of DA-6-treated and non-treated two white clover cultivars decreased significantly under water-deficit stress (Figure 2A). In both cultivars, the total Chl content and Chl a content of the DA-6-treated plants were significantly higher than those of the untreated plants under water-deficit stress (Figures 2A,B). In addition, the Chl b content of both drought-sensitive and -tolerant cultivars did not exhibit marked differences in response to water deficit (Figure 2C). Waterdeficit stress significantly affected the Fv/Fm, PIABS, and net photosynthetic rate of the two cultivars as compared to the wellwatered control (Figures 2D\u2013F).

In addition, the Ladino cultivar exhibited higher EL and MDA content than Riverdel in response to water-deficit stress (Figures 3A\u2013D). Water-deficit\nstress resulted in considerable increases in EL level and MDA content; however, exogenous DA-6 pretreatment mitigated the water stress-induced intensification of EL and MDA in both cultivars. EL was reduced by 12.5, 15.4, 20.4, and 15.5% on days 3, 6, 9, and 12, respectively, of water-deficit stress in Ladino because of DA-6 treatment. In Riverdel, EL was reduced by 9.2, 12.1, 13.4, and 10.5%, respectively, on days 3, 6, 9, and 12 of water-deficit stress because of exogenous DA-6 application (Figures 3A,B). MDA content exhibited a similar trend like EL in the DA-6 pretreated plants when compared with the untreated plants under water-deficient conditions (Figures 3C,D)."

            "text": "Plants have evolved various adaptive and tolerance mechanisms to survive water-deficit stress. Drought resistance differs greatly from plant species to species or genotype to genotype in nature, which provides vital basic materials for exploration of stress mechanism and breeding for stress resistance (Li et al., 2013; Basu et al., 2016). Our present study revealed that physiological responses including leaf water status and utilization (RWC, OP, and WUE), photosynthetic performance (Chl content, Fv/Fm, PIABS, and Pn), and oxidative damage and membrane stability (MDA and EL) exhibited significant differences in the two white clover cultivars, with Riverdel demonstrating better drought resistance than Ladino (Figures 1\u20133). Similar findings have been shown in our previous studies. Drought-resistant white clover genotypes had significantly higher osmotic adjustment and membrane stability as well as less oxidative damage than drought-susceptible ones when subjected to same duration of water-deficit stress (Li et al., 2013, 2015).

A previous study has also shown that DA-6 application enhanced the tolerance of Cassia obtusifolia to salt stress by maintenance of better PSII and antioxidant capacity (Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, DA-6 pretreatment mitigated cold-induced oxidative damage by improving the antioxidant defense system and photosynthesis in strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) seedlings (Fu et al., 2011). Our findings indicated positive effects of DA-6 on regulating amelioration in drought resistance of both white clover cultivars associated with enhanced water homeostasis, photosynthetic performance, and cell membrane stability. How DA-6-induced reprogramming of lipid profiling affected membrane stability and photosynthetic performance during water-deficit stress was discussed in detail below. Previous studies have reported that abiotic stresses restrained lipids biosynthesis as shown by decreased total lipids and Gll,\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 13 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879331\nPhl, and Spl contents in many plant species such as Lolium festuca (Perlikowski et al., 2016) under water-deficit stress, seashore paspalum (Gao et al., 2020) under salt stress, tall fescue (Zhang et al., 2019) under heat stress, and Arabidopsis (Nagano et al., 2014) under cold stress. Water-deficit stress decreased the total lipids and Gll, Phl, and Spl contents in both white clover cultivars, while the downtrend of these lipids was less in Riverdel than in Ladino. However, exogenous supply of DA-6 significantly alleviated water deficit-induced declines in total lipids and Gll, Phl, and Spl contents in both white clover cultivars (Figure 4). Similar findings were demonstrated in the study of Gao et al. (2020) who noticed that significant increases in total lipid content and Gll and Phl contents through exogenous choline treatment were propitious to maintain membrane structure and functionality in seashore paspalum plants under salt stress. According to the present findings, DA-6 played a key role in maintaining lipid synthesis in the two white clover cultivars subjected to water-deficit stress, which could contribute toward ameliorated drought resistance associated with membrane integrity, stability, and fluidity. Glls including DGDG, MGDG, and SQDG are primary constituents in thylakoid membranes and envelope of chloroplasts, hence playing critical functions in photosynthesis (Frentzen, 2004; Sato, 2004; H\u00f6lzl et al., 2009; Kobayashi, 2016; Fujii et al., 2017, 2018). The equilibrium between bilayer DGDG and non-bilayer MGDG and adequate proportion of SQDG and PG in chloroplastic membranes are essential to sustain membrane stability and efficiency of vital proteins involved in the process of photosynthesis (P\u00e1li et al., 2003; H\u00f6lzl and D\u00f6rmann, 2007). It has been shown that reduction in Gll content leads to Chl degradation and a decrease in photosynthetic function (D\u00f6rmann and Benning, 2002). Water-deficit stress caused a decline in the MGDG content of wheat leaves in the seedling stage (Wang et al., 2020). Furthermore, a study of Gasulla et al. (2013) illustrated that water-deficit stress induced a\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 14 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879331\nsubstantial decrease in the SQDG content of drought-sensitive Craterostigma plantagineum cultivars when compared to tolerant ones. MGDG and SQDG contents declined significantly in both white clover cultivars exposed to water-deficit stress; however, DGDG remained unaffected under water-deficit stress (Figure 5). The DA-6 application enhanced the accumulation of DGDG (18:3, 20:5, 20:6, 30:1, 30:2, 30:3, 30:4, 32:0, 32:1, 33:1, 33:2, 33:3, 34:1, 34:3, 34:4, 34:5, 35:1, 35:2, 35:3, 35:4, 36:1, 36:2, 36:3, 36:4, 36:5, 36:6, 37:3, 37:5, 37:6, 38:3, 38:4, 38:5, 39:6, 40:6, and 41:2) under water-deficit stress and alleviated water stress-induced declines in MGDG (32:0, 32:3, 33:3, 34:1, 34:2, 34:3, 34:4, 35:2, 35:5, 35:6, 36:2, 36:3, 36:5, 36:6, 37:4, 38:4, 38:5, 38:6, 38:9, and 39:4) and SQDG (34:1, 34:2, 36:4, 36:5, and 36:6) contents in both cultivars (Figures 5, 8). Drought-priming increased DGDG (36:6) and MGDG (34:4, 36:6) contents in leaves of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), which contributed to better stability and integrity of thylakoid membranes when tall fescue suffered from sustained heat stress (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, significantly higher DGDG:MGDG ratio was noticed in Riverdel pretreated with DA-6 under water-deficit stress (Table 1). It has been reported that higher DGDG:MGDG ratio in membranes is not only important for the folding and insertion of proteins (Bogdanov and Dowhan, 1999; D\u00f6rmann and Benning, 2002) but is also a key indicator of better bilayer structure associated with maintenance of chloroplast membrane stability and fluidity in plants under water-deficit stress(TorresFranklin et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2018a). In addition to Glls, PG is another lipid class located in thylakoid membranes and plays an important role in proper chloroplast function (Wang et al., 2010). Various studies have found that PG content was decreased significantly in plants under abiotic stresses such as salt and water scarcity (Guerfel et al., 2008; Gao et al., 2020). Improved thermotolerance induced by drought priming was associated with PG (34:3 and 34:4) accumulation in tall fescue (Zhang et al., 2019). In our study, PG content was decreased substantially in the two white clover cultivars under water-deficit stress. However, the DA-6 pretreatment significantly improved PG (30:4, 32:0, 32:6, 34:1, 34:2, 34:3, 35:4, 36:2, 36:4, 38:0, 38:5, 38:6, 40:1, 40:2, and 52:4) content in both cultivars (Figures 6, 8). Physiological responses also showed that water deficit-caused photoinhibition and decline in photochemical efficiency could be alleviated significantly by the application of DA-6 (Figure 2). These results proposed that improved drought resistance in white clover cultivars could be the result of improved DGDG:MGDG ratio and maintenance of PG and Gll (DGDG, MGDG, and SQDG) contents responsible for higher thylakoid membrane stability and functionality associated with better maintenance of photosynthesis under water-deficient conditions.\nPC and PE, two of the most abundant Phl species, are available in non-chloroplastic membranes for maintenance of membrane structure and function in plants (Larsson et al., 2006). PC acts as a precursor in the synthesis of various Glls (Ohlrogge and Browse, 1995), and PE is highly involved in signaling pathways under stress conditions (Chapman, 2000). A significant decrease in PE content has been observed in the leaves of olive trees subjected to water-deficit stress (Guerfel et al., 2008). The present findings revealed that water-deficit stress decreased PE content in\nthe two white clover cultivars when compared to the respective controls, but PC content did not exhibit marked difference in both white clover cultivars with or without DA-6 treatment under water-deficit stress (Figure 6). Both DA-6-pretreated cultivars demonstrated higher contents of PE (30:0, 32:1, 32:2, 32:3, 33:2, 34:1, 34:2, 34:3, 34:4, 34:5, 35:2, 36:1, 36:3, 36:4, 36:5, 37:0, 37:5, 38:1, 38:2, 38:3, 38:7, 38:8, 39:5, 40:2, 40:4, 40:5, 40:8, 41:1, 41:2, 42:9, and 42:10) and PC (32:1, 32:2, 34:1, 35:1, 35:2, 36:1, 36:3, 36:4, 36:5, 36:8, 37:2, 37:3, 37:5, 38:4, 38:5, 39:3, 40:2, 40:3, 40:5, 41:2, 41:3, and 42:2) molecular species in contrast to the untreated plants under water-deficit stress (Figure 8). Higher levels of PE in the plasma membrane of plants exposed to water stress could help to alleviate membrane damage in wilting protoplasts and maintain catalytic activities of membrane enzymes through enhanced lipid-protein interactions (Larsson et al., 2006). A previous study conducted on grapevines also illustrated that water deficit induced a significant increase in PC/PE ratio in cell membranes (Toumi et al., 2008). Higher PC/PE ratio was linked with enhanced membrane stability, fluidity, and flexibility because of the bilayer-prone characteristic of PC (Narayanan et al., 2018). This study showed higher PC/PE ratio in Riverdel than in Ladino under water-deficit stress. In addition, significantly higher PC/PE ratio was only observed in the water deficit-stressed Riverdel pretreated with DA-6 when compared with the well-watered control (Table 1). These results indicated that the higher PC:PE ratio in Riverdel is an important reason for enhanced membrane stability and better adaption to water-deficit stress compared with Ladino. The DA-6-regulated drought resistance was related to alterations in molecular species of PC and PE.\nPI is an imperative constituent of the plasma membrane and is involved in the regulation of signaling pathways and maintenance of cell metabolic activities under adverse environmental conditions. It acts as a critical precursor in biosynthesis pathways of various Phls, such as PIP, PIP2, and PA, which initiate signal transduction to trigger specific genes in relation to plant adaption to environmental hazards (L\u00f6fke et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2009). Among Phls, PA is a well-known secondary messenger that performs regulatory functions in lipid metabolism, signaling transduction pathways (e.g., calcium and ROS signaling), and cytoskeleton dynamics (Testerink and Munnik, 2005; Zhao, 2015). Earlier studies have revealed that PLD-synthesized PA was involved in adaptive responses to cold stress (Li et al., 2004), heat stress (Wang and Huang, 2017), and water-deficit stress (Chen et al., 2018b) in different plant species. Phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) gene overexpression in Nicotiana tobaccum enhanced PI and other Phls as well as Glls (PE, PC, PG, DGDG, and MGDG) accumulation associated with improved membrane stability and integrity under water-deficit stress (Zhai et al., 2012). Our current study showed that DA-6 not only further promoted water deficit-induced PI accumulation but also significantly alleviated water deficit-induced decline in PA in both cultivars (Figure 6). These findings indicated that ameliorated resistance by DA-6 and better drought resistance in Riverdel could be associated with maintenance of PI and PA synthesis contributing to enhanced membrane stability, fluidity, and structural integrity. For changes in different molecular\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 15 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879331\nspecies of PI and PA, the DA-6 pretreatment significantly enhanced the PA (34:1, 34:2, 34:3, 34:4, 36:1, 36:2, 36:3, 36:4, 36:5, 38:2, 40:2, 40:3, 41:2, 41:3, 42:2, and 42:3) and PI (34:2, 36:2, 36:5, and 51:3) content in both cultivars in response to water-deficit stress (Figure 8). It has been found that significant increases in PA (34:1, 34:2, and 36:5) and PI (34:3 and 34:4) induced by choline pretreatment and drought priming were beneficial for plants to acclimate to salt stress or heat stress (Zhang et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020).\nPS species are confined to the interior surface of cell membranes, and their roles are not well-documented in plants as other Phls (Vance and Steenbergen, 2005). It is worth mentioning that PS is involved in the biosynthesis of other Phl species such as PC and PE (Larsson et al., 2006). Long-chain fatty acids consisting of molecular species of PS could facilitate cellular transport and maintenance of the bilayer curvature in the plasma membrane (Vincent et al., 2001). The study of Gasulla et al. (2013) found that PS content was increased significantly in the cell membrane of desiccation-tolerant Craterostigma plantagineum but was significantly decreased in two desiccation-sensitive species (Lindernia subracemosa and Arabidopsis thaliana) in response to water-deficit stress, indicating that enhanced PS accumulation is in favor of better adaptation to water stress. Although water-deficit stress significantly decreased the PS content in both white clover cultivars, Riverdel accumulated more PS content than Ladino under well-watered and water-limited conditions, which could be one of the important reasons for better stress resistance and genetic superiority of Riverdel under water-deficient conditions. In addition, the application of DA-6 improved PS accumulation under well-watered conditions and effectively alleviated water deficit-induced decline in the PS content of both of Riverdel and Ladino. However, the function and the role of DA-6-induced increases in PSmolecular species (33:1, 34:0, 36:4, 36:6, 38:2, 39:0, 39:1, 39:3, 40:1, 40:2, 40:3, 42:1, 42:2, 43:2, 44:4, 47:3, 47:4, 49:4 or 53:3) in Riverdel and Ladino needs to be further investigated in white clover under water-deficit stress (Figure 8).\nSpls are structural components of lipid bilayers and perform their roles via bioactive metabolites as mediators of primary vesicular and physiological functions in plants. In addition, Spls are also involved in signal transduction under unfavorable environmental conditions (Michaelson et al., 2016). For instance, the ceramide constituent of Spls has been reported to be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death (PCD) (Liang et al., 2003). Spls play a vital role as signaling molecules during ABAregulated guard cell closure (Ng et al., 2001; Coursol et al., 2003, 2005). Cer acts as the backbone of Spls and functions as a key signaling molecule to regulate stress signal transduction in plants (Hanada, 2003; Ore\u0161ic\u030c et al., 2008). GlcCers (e.g., Hex1Cer), also known as glycosylceramides, are one of the highly abundant Spl groups in the plasma membrane, tonoplast of plant cells, and envelope of chloroplast membranes and take part in the maintenance of membranes stability (Lynch and Steponkus, 1987; Cahoon and Lynch, 1991; Uemura and Steponkus, 1994; Uemura et al., 1995; Spassieva and Hille, 2003). Previous studies have shown that GlcCer content was reduced to one-half in cell membranes during cold stress in rye (Secale\ncereale) and Arabidopsis (Lynch and Steponkus, 1987; Uemura and Steponkus, 1994; Uemura et al., 1995; Nagano et al., 2014). In this study, Sph, Cer, and Hex1Cer were significantly decreased in both white clover cultivars under water-deficit stress. However, the exogenous application of DA-6 increased the Cer (30:0, 32:0, 34:2, 34:3, 37:5, and 42:1), Hex1Cer (34:2, 40:0, 40:1, 40:2, 40:3, 42:2, and 42:3), and Sph (16:0, 16:1, and 18:0) contents in the two white clover cultivars under water-deficit stress, which could be associated with DA-6-regulated drought resistance by maintenance of membrane structure, chloroplast functionality, and signaling transduction pathways. In addition, SM and neutral glycosphingolipids (e.g., CerG2GNAc1) are the major Spl groups in animals and are available in minute quantities in plants, but their potential roles in plants have not been well-revealed and discussed in detail (Lester and Dickson, 1993; Geta Tafesse et al., 2006). Water-deficit stress significantly reduced SM in both cultivars and decreased the CerG2GNAc1 content in Ladino but did not affect the CerG2GNAc1 content in Riverdel (Figure 7). However, whether differential responses of CerG2GNAc1 and SM contributed to different stress resistance between Riverdel and Ladino or whether DA-6 improving CerG2GNAc1 and SM accumulation proved beneficial for drought resistance needs to be further investigated in plants, since little information is available on their roles in plants under environmental stresses so far.\nSignificant alteration in the degree of unsaturation of membrane lipids is an important adaption approach governed by fatty acid desaturases under unfavorable environmental conditions (Upchurch, 2008; Tshabuse et al., 2018). Unsaturation index has been widely used as an indicator of the degree of unsaturation. The higher unsaturation index of various lipids showed a positive correlation with better membrane stability and fluidity when plants suffer from a long period of water-deficit stress (Quartacci et al., 2002; Gigon et al., 2004; Toumi et al., 2008). Our results revealed that the unsaturation indexes of PA and PC in Riverdel were increased under water-deficit stress and that the unsaturation index of PE was decreased significantly in response to water-deficit stress (Figure 9). In addition, waterdeficit stress significantly reduced the unsaturation index of SQDG, PG, and PI in both white clover cultivars. The exogenous application of DA-6 significantly increased the unsaturation index of PA and PI in Ladino and Cer and Hex1Cer in Riverdel under water-deficit stress (Figure 9). Moreover, DA-6 also improved the unsaturation index of SQDG in both cultivars under water-deficit stress (Figure 9). These results indicated that the DA-6 regulated resistance in Ladino and Riverdel could be associated with improved unsaturation index of the SQDG, PG, PI, Cer, and Hex1Cer classes contributing to enhanced membrane fluidity and integrity under water-deficit stress."

Genotypic differences in drought resistance of the two genotypes and the beneficial effects of DA-6 pretreatment were correlated with changes in lipidomic profiling, unsaturation index, and ratio of lipids (Figure 10). A possible mechanism of drought resistance linked with lipid metabolism was that drought-resistant Riverdel could maintain higher lipid content, DGDG/MGDG ratio, and PC/PE ratio than drought-sensitive Ladino during the same duration of water-deficit stress. The DA-6 pretreatment induced significant increases in DGDG, MGDG, SQDG, PA, PE, PG, PI, PS, Cer, Hex1Cer, CerG2GNAc1 and Sph contents in both white clover cultivars. DA-6 also increased the DGDG:MGDG ratio and the relative content of SM in drought-resistant Riverdel. In addition, DA-6 increased the unsaturation index of PA and PI in Ladino and of Cer and Hex1Cer in Riverdel as well as the SQDG content in both cultivars under water-deficit stress. The DA-6-regulated lipid reprogramming and improvement of DGDG:MGDG ratio and unsaturation index of lipid species conferred enhanced membrane stability, integrity, fluidity, and downstream signaling transduction when white clover suffered from water-deficit stress."
