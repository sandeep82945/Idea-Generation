    "abstractText": "16 Perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) is a unique visceral depot that contains a mixture of brown and white 17 adipocytes. The origin and plasticity of such cellular heterogeneity remains unknown. Here, we combine single18 nucleus RNA sequencing with genetic lineage tracing to reveal the existence of a distinct subpopulation of Ucp1 19 /Cidea adipocytes that arises from brown-to-white conversion during postnatal life in the peri-ureter region of 20 mouse PRAT. Cold exposure restores Ucp1 expression and a thermogenic phenotype in this subpopulation. 21 These cells have a transcriptome that is distinct from subcutaneous beige adipocytes and may represent a unique 22 type of cold-recruitable adipocytes. These results pave the way for studies of PRAT physiology and mechanisms 23 controlling the plasticity of brown/white adipocyte phenotypes. 24",

            "text": "Perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) is a unique visceral depot that contains a mixture of brown and white 17 adipocytes. The origin and plasticity of such cellular heterogeneity remains unknown. Here, we combine single-18 nucleus RNA sequencing with genetic lineage tracing to reveal the existence of a distinct subpopulation of Ucp1-19 /Cidea+ adipocytes that arises from brown-to-white conversion during postnatal life in the peri-ureter region of 20 mouse PRAT. Cold exposure restores Ucp1 expression and a thermogenic phenotype in this subpopulation. 21 These cells have a transcriptome that is distinct from subcutaneous beige adipocytes and may represent a unique 22 type of cold-recruitable adipocytes. These results pave the way for studies of PRAT physiology and mechanisms 23 controlling the plasticity of brown/white adipocyte phenotypes. 24\n25\nKeywords 26\nperirenal adipose tissue, browning, whitening, snRNA-seq, peri-vascular, peri-ureter, cold-responsive, beige 27 adipocyte 28\nIntroduction 29\nAdipose tissue is composed of adipocytes and a stromal vascular fraction (SVF) that contains highly 30 heterogeneous populations of adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs), vascular endothelial cells, immune 31 cells and small populations of other cell types (Rodeheffer et al., 2008; Trim and Lynch, 2022; Wang et al., 32 2020). Based on morphological and functional differences, adipocytes have been classified into three types, i.e., 33 white, brown and beige adipocytes. Being the most abundant type of adipocyte, white adipocytes (WAs) contain 34 a single large lipid droplet that occupies most of their intracellular space. They are present in visceral and 35 subcutaneous depots and their primary function is to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides. WAs also 36 secrete a number of hormones, including leptin, adiponectin and several others, that regulate the function of 37 other cells in adipose tissue as well as other organs (Scheja and Heeren, 2019). In contrast, brown adipocytes 38 (BAs) contain numerous small lipid droplets and a high density of mitochondria. Their primary function is the 39 generation of heat, i.e. thermogenesis, through uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain from 40 ATP production to produce heat. This is mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a BA-specific protein located 41 at the inner mitochondrial membrane (Cohen and Kajimura, 2021). Beige adipocytes (BeAs) are residents of 42 subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) depots that possess inducible thermogenic capacity, despite very low 43 basal levels of UCP1 expression (Petrovic et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2012). Thanks to recent advances in single-44 nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), transcriptomic profiling of adipocytes at single-cell resolution has 45 become feasible. snRNA-seq analysis of mouse and human WAT depots has revealed adipocyte subpopulations 46 that are related to lipogenesis, lipid-scavenging and stress responses (Emont et al., 2022; Sarvari et al., 2021). 47 Profiling of adipocytes from interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) of mouse and human has identified a 48 subpopulation that negatively regulates thermogenesis via paracrine secretion of acetate (Sun et al., 2020). 49\nVisceral depots such as epidydimal, mesenteric and retroperitoneal adipose tissues are mainly made of 50 WAs; whereas BAs and BeAs are often found in subcutaneous depots, such as iBAT and inguinal WAT (iWAT). 51 Perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) is bilaterally distributed around the kidney and is encapsulated by a 52 multilayered fibrous membrane, known as the renal fascia (de Jong et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019). The medial 53 region of PRAT (herein termed mPRAT) is located around the hilum of the kidney, and several studies have 54 identified UCP1-expressing BAs in this area in human PRAT, suggesting it represents a form of visceral BAT 55 (Betz et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Nagano et al., 2015; Svensson et al., 2014; van den Beukel et al., 2015; Vergnes 56 et al., 2016). In contrast, the lateral region of PRAT (herein termed lPRAT) is predominantly composed of WAs 57 (de Jong et al., 2015). Based on morphological changes in adipocytes of human PRAT during aging, a process 58 of continuous replacement of BAs by WAs has been proposed (Tanuma et al., 1976; Tanuma et al., 1975). On 59 the other hand, analysis of PRAT collected at necropsy from people living in Siberia revealed an up to 40% BA 60 component, indicating the potential of PRAT to respond to low environmental temperature (Efremova et al., 61 2020). Moreover, so-called \u201cdormant\u201d BAs have been described in PRAT of adult kidney donors, characterized 62 by unilocular morphology, high levels of UCP1 expression and a gene expression profile that partially overlaps 63 that of WAs (Jespersen et al., 2019). 64\nThe process by which BAs acquire WA-like properties has been referred to as \u201cwhitening\u201d, and it is 65 characterized by the enlargement of lipid droplets and reduced expression of thermogenic genes, such as Ucp1 66 (Shimizu et al., 2014). Brown-to-white conversion or whitening is a known complication of obesity associated 67 with vascular rarefaction, tissue inflammation and leptin receptor deficiency (Kotzbeck et al., 2018; Rangel-68 Azevedo et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2014). In addition, warm adaptation, impaired \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and 69 loss of adipose triglyceride lipase have also been implicated in BAT whitening (Kotzbeck et al., 2018). Under 70\nnormal physiological conditions, whitening of BAT has only been demonstrated in rabbit iBAT (Huang et al., 71 2022). With regards to PRAT, it is unclear whether the process by which the number of WAs increase at the 72 expense of BAs during postnatal life reflects direct brown-to-white cell conversion or some other mechanisms 73 of replacement. Moreover, the cellular and molecular properties of the newly formed WA population as well as 74 its spatial distribution in PRAT remain unknown. 75\nIn the present study, we took advantage of snRNA-seq and genetic lineage tracing methods to reveal the 76 existence of a bona fide whitening process of BAs in the mPRAT during mouse postnatal development. We 77 identified a distinct population of newly formed adipocytes derived by whitening, described its anatomical 78 location, and characterized its molecular properties both during its formation and after cold exposure. In addition, 79 our analysis of cells in the lPRAT, revealed populations of adipocytes, ASPCs and macrophages that are 80 transcriptionally distinct from those found in classical visceral fat depots such as epididymal WAT (eWAT). 81\nResults 82\nsnRNA-seq analysis of murine mPRAT reveals a unique adipocyte subpopulation and uncovers 83 evidence of a brown-to-white transition during postnatal development 84\nTo explore the cellular dynamics of mPRAT and iBAT during postnatal development, we collected the 85 tissues from 1-, 2- and 6-month-old C57BL/6J male mice for whole tissue snRNA-seq and performed depot-86 specific analysis. As expected, weight of the collected tissues gradually increased as the animals grew up (Figure 87 S1A). After strict quality control (Figure S1B-C), we profiled a total of 11,708 and 31,079 nuclei for mPRAT 88 and iBAT, respectively. In the integrated datasets of mPRAT, we identified 6 clusters based on differentially 89 expressed genes (DEGs), including adipocyte, ASPC, macrophage, vascular (endothelial cell and pericyte) and 90 mesothelial cells that are commonly present in adipose tissue (Massier et al., 2023) (Figure 1A-B and S1D-E). 91 mPRAT was mostly composed of adipocytes and the relative proportions of all the cell types remained largely 92 unchanged during the analyzed time points (Figure 1C). Similar cell types and cellular composition were 93 identified in the integrated datasets of iBAT, with the exception of the presence of smooth muscle cells and 94 absence of mesothelial cells (Figure 1D-F and S1F-G). 95\nNext, we scrutinized mPRAT adipocyte population in greater detail through further clustering. Adipocytes 96 in murine mPRAT were highly heterogeneous and could be separated into 4 interconnected subpopulations, all 97 expressing the Plin1 gene that encodes the lipid droplet protein Perilipin, which we referred to as mPRAT-ad1, 98 2, 3 and 4, respectively (Figure 1G-H and S1H). mPRAT-ad1 resembled classical BAs and expressed Ucp1, 99 Cidea, Pank1 and Gk (Figure 1H-I). mPRAT-ad2 was characterized by the expression of Cidea, Pank1 and Gk, 100 but not Ucp1 (Figure 1H-I). In addition, it also expressed detectable levels of Cyp2e1 and Slit3 (Figure 1H-I), 101 two genes which have recently been implicated in thermogenesis regulation (Sun et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). 102 Such gene expression pattern suggested that mPRAT-ad2 may contain BA-like cells that could be recruited by 103 stimuli that induce thermogenesis. In contrast, mPRAT-ad3, which expressed higher levels of Cyp2e1 and Slit3, 104 lower levels of Tshr and Slc7a10, but not Aldh1a1 or Lep; and mPRAT-ad4, which expressed Cyp2e1, Slit3, 105 Aldh1a1, Lep and high levels of Tshr and Slc7a10, more closely resembled classical WAs, of which mPRAT-106 ad4 would appear to be at a more mature stage (Figure 1H-I). Adipocytes of iBAT could also be separated into 107 4 distinct subpopulations, which we referred to as iBAT-ad1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (Figure S1I). iBAT-ad1, 2 108 and 3 contained BAs that expressed different levels of Ucp1 and Cidea, and may correspond to previously 109 identified low- and high-thermogenic BA subpopulations (Song et al., 2020) (Figure S1J-L). Altogether, they 110 comprised over 90% of the total adipocyte population in iBAT (Figure S1I). On the other hand, iBAT-ad4 111\nexpressed Cyp2e1, Slit3, Slc7a10, Aldh1a1 and Lep, and module score analysis of signature genes showed it to 112 bear close similarity to the recently identified P4 adipocyte subpopulation that regulates thermogenesis in iBAT 113 (Sun et al., 2020) (Figure S1M). Comparison between mPRAT and iBAT adipocyte transcriptomes using module 114 score analysis revealed that mPRAT-ad1 was more similar to all iBAT BA subpopulations (iBAT-ad1, 2 and 3), 115 while mPRAT-ad3 and 4 were more similar to iBAT-ad4 (Figure S1N). Interestingly, we could not find a match 116 for mPRAT-ad2 among iBAT adipocytes (Figure S1N), suggesting that it represents a distinct subpopulation of 117 adipocytes specific to mPRAT, but absent in classical BAT. 118\nCloser inspection of mPRAT adipocyte composition at 1, 2 and 6 months revealed a gradual decrease in 119 the proportions of mPRAT subpopulations ad1 (43.0, 34.9-and 33.1%, respectively) and ad2 (36.1, 31.2 and 120 23.9%, respectively), which was accompanied by a reciprocal increase in ad3 (14.7, 26.8 and 29.9%, 121 respectively) and ad4 (6.2, 7.1 and 13.1%, respectively) (Figure 1G), suggesting the existence of a progressive 122 transition in the adipocyte composition of mPRAT during postnatal life. This possibility was further investigated 123 by Monocle 3 trajectory analysis of these cells, which revealed a single continuous trajectory linking the four 124 subpopulations (Figure 1J). Based on the pattern of composition changes observed through time (Figure 1G), 125 we defined mPRAT-ad1 subpopulation as the starting point of the trajectory uncovering pseudo-time values that 126 increased steadily from mPRAT-ad1 to mPRAT-ad4 (Figure 1J-K). Along the pseudo-timeline, BA module 127 genes such as Ucp1, Cidea, Ppargc1b, Gk and Pank1 showed decreasing expression levels, whereas WA module 128 genes such as Npr3, Aldh1a1, Tshr, Slc7a10, Slit3 and Cyp2e1 showed the opposite trend (Figure 1K). Gene 129 ontology enrichment analysis of these genes revealed a progressive transition from catabolic to anabolic 130 processes along the pseudo-time trajectory (Figure 1L). The midpoint of the trajectory, corresponding to the 131 mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation, coincided with the highest expression levels of lipogenic genes, including Acly and 132 Acaca, as well as enrichment in several synthetic pathways (Figure 1K-L). A similar analysis on iBAT 133 adipocytes failed to reveal a distinct trajectory and its pseudo-time length of up to 12.8 (Figure S1O) was much 134 shorter than that found in mPRAT adipocytes, which reached 26.7 (Figure 1J), suggesting a less heterogeneous 135 and more stable adipocyte population in iBAT. Taken together, these results suggested the occurrence of a 136 brown-to-white transition during postnatal development in adipocytes of mouse mPRAT. 137\nRe-clustering of mPRAT ASPC population revealed three subpopulations (referred to as mPRAT-aspc1 to 138 3, respectively) that shared the expression of the ASPC marker gene Pdgfra (Figure S2A-C). mPRAT-aspc1 139 (expressing Dpp4, Pi16, Anxa3) was identified as fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), while mPRAT-aspc2 140 (expressing Pdgfrb and low levels of Pparg) and mPRAT-aspc3 (expressing high levels of Pparg, Cd36, Cidea) 141 represented preadipocytes at different stages of differentiation (Figure S2B). mPRAT-aspc1 and 2 comprised 142 the majority of the ASPC population at all three time points and a reciprocal switch in their relative proportions 143 was observed between 2 and 6 months of age (Figure S2D). iBAT ASPCs could also be re-clustered into three 144 distinct subpopulations (termed iBAT-aspc1 to 3, respectively), which presented good correspondence to the 145 three ASPCs subpopulations identified in mPRAT (Figure S2E-G). However, unlike mPRAT, iBAT ASPC 146 subpopulations showed more dynamic changes in their relative composition during the three postnatal times 147 examined (Figure S2H). We further investigated the apparent similarities between mPRAT and iBAT ASPCs by 148 co-clustering the two cell populations. This revealed a high degree of overlap between them with similar marker 149 genes and good correspondence among their different subpopulations (Figure S2I-K), indicating similar 150 transcriptomes and suggesting that they may give rise to similar types of adipocytes. Thus, the fact that PRAT-151 specific mPRAT-ad2 is absent in iBAT suggested to us that those cells may arise from brown-to-white 152 conversion of adipocyte subpopulations rather than ASPC differentiation. 153\nThe cellular composition of lPRAT is significantly different from that in eWAT at the 154 transcriptional level 155\nNext, we explored the transcriptome of lPRAT in 2- and 6-month-old C57BL/6J male mice using snRNA-156 seq. The integrated datasets comprised a total of 6,048 nuclei after filtering (Figure S2L) and allowed us to 157 identify 4 distinct clusters, including adipocytes, ASPCs, macrophages and mesothelial cells (Figure 2A-B). 158 The proportion of adipocytes in lPRAT decreased from 2 to 6 months (70.6% to 46.5%), accompanied by a 159 reciprocal increase in the macrophage population (5.7% to 23.8%) (Figure 2C). Such changes have previously 160 been shown to mark an aging signature in visceral adipose tissue (Lumeng et al., 2011). As expected, lPRAT 161 adipocytes were enriched in WA (Lep and Acvr1c) but not BA markers (Ucp1 and Cidea) (Figure 2B). 162\nRe-clustering of the adipocyte population revealed four distinct subpopulations (lPRAT-ad1 to 4) (Figure 163 2D), all of which expressed high levels of genes typical of WAT such as Adrb3, Lpl, and Cd36 (Figure 2E). 164 lPRAT-ad1 expressed genes related to lipogenesis (Fasn, Acly), endocytosis (Ighm, Anxa2) and stress response 165 (Fgf1, Hif1a) (Figure 2E). lPRAT-ad-2 comprised more than half of the total lPRAT adipocyte population 166 (Figure 2D) and expressed high levels of genes that are involved in adipogenesis regulation, such as Irf2 and 167 Mitf (Figure 2E). lPRAT-ad3 and 4 expressed genes that oppose lipogenesis (Cdk8) and control lipid handling 168 (Camk1d) (Figure 2E). Reciprocal changes in the relative proportions of lPRAT-ad3 and lPRAT-ad4 were 169 observed from 2 to 6 months: lPRAT-ad3 increased from 4.7% to 17.2% at the expense of lPRAT-ad4 that 170 decreased from 21.5% to 4.1% (Figure 2D). We then compared the transcriptome of lPRAT adipocytes with that 171 of eWAT, a better characterized visceral fat depot, using a previously published eWAT snRNA-seq dataset 172 (Sarvari et al., 2021). Unexpectedly, the two populations showed only a partial overlap (Figure 2F). Specifically, 173 lPRAT-ad1 resembled the lipogenic adipocyte and the stressed lipid scavenging adipocyte subpopulations 174 previously described in eWAT, while lPRAT-ad2 was more similar to the lipid-scavenging adipocyte 175 subpopulation of eWAT. In contrast, however, lPRAT-ad3 and 4 showed no overlap with previously identified 176 subpopulations of eWAT adipocytes (Figure 2F), suggesting that they may represent unique cell types to the 177 lPRAT depot. 178\nThe ASPC population of lPRAT could be subclustered into two subpopulations: FAPs characterized by 179 expression of Dpp4 and Pi16 (lPRAT-aspc1) and preadipocytes expressing Pdgfrb, Pparg and Cd36 (lPRAT-180 aspc2) that comprised over 85% of the ASPC population at both time points (Figure 2G-H). Co-clustering of 181 the lPRAT APSC population with the one previously defined in eWAT by Sarvari et al. revealed a partial overlap 182 with their FAP2 and FAP3 subpopulations, although the bulk of lPRAT ASPCs appeared largely unrelated to 183 ASPCs from eWAT (Figure 2I). Sub-clustering of the macrophages in lPRAT identified three subpopulations 184 (lPRAT-mac1 to 3), all of which expressed typical macrophage markers, including Adgre1 and Mctp1 (Figure 185 2J-K). lPRAT-mac1 specifically expressed Trem2 and Atp6v0d2, signature macrophage genes that have recently 186 been proposed to participate in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis under high-fat diet (Dai et al., 2022; 187 Jaitin et al., 2019) (Figure 2K). Intriguingly, this subpopulation increased almost 10-fold (from 8.1% to 73.8%) 188 from 2 to 6 months (Figure 2J), in line with the notion that aging mimics some of the gene signatures induced 189 by high-fat diet (Lumeng et al., 2011). A reciprocal decrease in proportion of both lPRAT-mac2, characterized 190 by Fn1 expression, and lPRAT-mac3, marked by expression of Cd163 and Plekhg5, was also found during this 191 period of time (Figure 2J-K). Unexpectedly, comparison with the macrophage subpopulations identified in 192 eWAT by Sarvari et el. revealed that lPRAT and eWAT macrophage populations were very different from each 193 other (Figure 2L), suggesting dissimilar local microenvironments in the two tissues (Lavin et al., 2014). Taken 194 together, these results indicated that the cellular composition of lPRAT is significantly different from that of 195 eWAT, despite both being visceral WAT depots. 196\nEvidence of brown-to-white adipocyte conversion in the peri-ureter region of mPRAT 197\nUCP1 immunostaining in kidney explants and attached PRAT from juvenile (6 weeks) and adult (8 months) 198 mice was more intense in the anterior portion of the mPRAT that wraps around the renal blood vessels (herein 199 termed peri-vascular PRAT, pvPRAT) compared to the posterior region covering the ureter (herein termed peri-200 ureter PRAT, puPRAT) (Figure S3A-B), suggesting an uneven distribution of UCP1-expressing BAs in mPRAT. 201 In addition, UCP1 staining was decreased in adult compared to juvenile mPRAT and absent from lPRAT, as 202 expected (Figure S3A). In order to investigate brown-to-white conversion of mPRAT adipocytes during 203 postnatal life, we used the Ucp1Cre;Ai14 mouse line that drives expression of tdTomato in BAs from the 204 moment these activate the Ucp1 gene (Kong et al., 2014). UCP1 immunostaining of mPRAT sections in 2-205 month-old Ucp1Cre;Ai14 mice enabled us to assess whether and to which extent tdTomato+ adipocytes had lost 206 UCP1 expression, an indication of brown-to-white conversion (Figure 3A). This analysis revealed that 61.8% 207 of tdTomato+ cells in puPRAT no longer expressed UCP1 by 2 months of age (Figure 3A-B). In contrast, only 208 7.5% of tdTomato+ cells did not express UCP1 in pvPRAT at this age (Figure 3A-B). These results suggested a 209 significant loss of the BA phenotype in puPRAT, consistent with brown-to-white conversion in this region. In 210 agreement with this, many tdTomato+/UCP1- adipocytes displayed one large unilocular lipid droplet, a 211 morphological hallmark of WAs (insets in Figure 3A). In line with our analysis of kidney explants, puPRAT 212 contained a significantly lower proportion of tdTomato+ adipocytes (Figure 3C) and adipocytes that expressed 213 UCP1 at 2-month of age (UCP1+) (Figure 3D) compared to pvPRAT. A similar analysis of iBAT failed to reveal 214 evidence of brown-to-white conversion (Figure 3A-B), in agreement with previous studies (Huang et al., 2022). 215 Histological analysis of tissue sections of mouse PRAT and iBAT from 1 to 6 months old revealed that the size 216 of lipid droplets increased by around 5.5-fold in puPRAT and about 2.3-fold in pvPRAT (Figure 3E-F), in 217 agreement with a more pronounced brown-to-white transition in the puPRAT region. Immunostaining of the 218 puPRAT region for CYP2E1 and ALDH1A1, markers of mPRAT-ad3/4 and -ad4 subpopulations of mPRAT 219 WAs, respectively, revealed that a proportion of tdTomato+/UCP1- adipocytes expressed these genes (34 and 220 23%, respectively, Figures 3G-I). This indicated that cells that are initially BAs can undergo brown-to-white 221 conversion all the way to mPRAT-ad3 and -ad4 WA subtypes, as predicted by our pseudo-time trajectory 222 analysis. The remaining fraction of tdTomato+/UCP1- adipocytes have likely transitioned to the mPRAT-ad2 223 subtype. Together, these results pointed to the existence of a subpopulation of BAs, the majority of which resided 224 in puPRAT, that underwent brown-to-white conversion during postnatal growth, characterized by loss of UCP1 225 and increase in lipid droplet size, to become mPRAT-ad3 and 4 subpopulations of WAs as well as the more 226 intermediate subpopulation of mPRAT-ad2. 227\nCold exposure prevents brown-to-white conversion and induces UCP1 expression in mPRAT 228\nA significant increase in UCP1 mRNA and protein levels was observed in mPRAT and iBAT of 1-month-229 old mice following 4 weeks cold exposure (2 weeks at 18\u00b0C + 2 weeks at 10\u00b0C), but UCP1 expression could 230 not be detected in lPRAT under either condition (Figure 4A-C). Cold exposure had a dramatic effect on lipid 231 droplet size in pvPRAT and iBAT, but less so in puPRAT, which retained several large lipid droplets even after 232 cold exposure (Figure 4D). These results indicated that mPRAT, especially the peri-vascular region, can indeed 233 respond to cold exposure in a fashion similar to canonical BAT from iBAT. Not only did cold exposure enhanced 234 the thermogenic phenotype of mPRAT, but it also counteracted brown-to-white conversion of BAs in this tissue. 235 Following cold exposure, the proportion of tdTomato+/UCP1- adipocytes in Ucp1CreERT2;Ai14 mice was 236 significantly lower compared to room temperature in both puPRAT and pvPRAT (Figure 4E-G). Interestingly, 237 the proportion of tdTomato-/UCP1+ adipocytes was increased after cold exposure in both areas (Figure 4H). 238 This population of cold-recruited BAs might have arisen de novo through differentiation of ASPCs and/or 239\nconversion from UCP1- adipocytes. Using PdgfraCreERT2;Ai14 mice subjected to the same experimental 240 conditions, we found that cold exposure increased the proportion of tdTomato+/UCP1+ adipocytes (namely 241 ASPC-derived BAs) in puPRAT by a much smaller magnitude (2.3-fold) than the total increase in cold-recruited 242 BAs (10- fold), while the difference was less dramatic in pvPRAT (4.4- vs 2.2 fold) (Figure 4H-K). These results 243 indicated that new BAs induced by cold exposure were mainly derived from UCP1- adipocytes rather than de 244 novo ASPC differentiation in puPRAT (Figure 4L), whereas the two processes contributed equally in the peri-245 vascular region. Cold exposure also affected brown-to-white conversion in adult animals, as shown by a 246 significant reduction in the proportion of tdTomato+/UCP1- adipocytes in both puPRAT and pvPRAT (Figure 247 5A-C). Similar increase in the proportion of tdTomato-/UCP1+ adipocytes after cold exposure was also observed 248 in both areas (highlighted by yellow arrows in Figure 5B). 249\nmPRAT-ad2 is the major adipocyte subpopulation induced by cold exposure to become BA in 250 adult mPRAT 251\nIn order to reveal the first line of response to cold exposure and identify the main affected subpopulation 252 among mPRAT adipocytes, we subjected 6-month-old mice to a more acute cold exposure (4\u00b0C for 3 days) and 253 collected the mPRAT for snRNA-seq analysis. As expected, cold exposure caused a dramatic decrease in lipid 254 droplet size in pvPRAT, puPRAT, iBAT and iWAT (Figure S4A). After filtering (Figure S4B), a total of 7,387 255 nuclei could be clustered into adipocytes, ASPCs, macrophages, vascular cells (endothelial cell and pericyte) 256 and mesothelial cells (Figure S4C, E), without apparent difference in the relative proportions of these cell types 257 between mice exposed to cold and those kept at room temperature (Figure S4D). Upon sub-clustering, the 258 adipocyte population was separated into four subpopulations (Figure 5D-F) that were highly similar to the four 259 mPRAT adipocyte subpopulations identified in our previous datasets (mPRAT-ad1-4) (Figure S4F). Interestingly, 260 cold exposure had dramatic effects on the composition of mPRAT: the proportion of mPRAT-ad1 doubled, the 261 mPRAT-ad2 cells all disappeared, the mPRAT-ad3 subpopulation was reduced by 30%, while the proportion of 262 mPRAT-ad4 cells remained unaffected (Figure 5E). As no enhanced cell death was observed upon cold exposure 263 (Figure S4G), it is likely that the entire mPRAT-ad2 and part of the mPRAT-ad3 subpopulations were converted 264 to the thermogenic Ucp1+ mPRAT-ad1 subpopulation, upon a dramatic increase in Ucp1 expression following 265 cold exposure (Figure 5F). Thus, the mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation that underwent brown-to-white conversion 266 during postnatal life would appear to be the major subpopulation that reverted to a thermogenic, Ucp1+ 267 phenotype upon cold exposure in adult mPRAT. Comparison of differentially enriched genes and gene 268 regulatory networks in mPRAT-ad1, 3 and 4 after cold exposure or at room temperature are presented in Figure 269 5G-J. We also noted that the proportions of ASPC subpopulations in mPRAT remained relatively unchanged 270 after cold exposure (Figure S4H-I), suggesting that precursor cells may be less sensitive to environmental 271 temperature and have a limited contribution to mature adipocyte phenotypes through de novo adipogenesis after 272 cold exposure. 273\nmPRAT-ad2 subtype is transcriptionally different from iWAT adipocytes under both room 274 temperature and cold exposure conditions 275\nHaving demonstrated the existence of an adipocyte subpopulation in mPRAT that can be induced to express 276 a thermogenic profile in response to cold exposure, we sought to perform a comparison with the transcriptional 277 profiles of iBAT and iWAT adipocytes subjected to the same conditions in the same animals. In iBAT, analysis 278 of 27,717 nuclei after filtering (Figure S5A) revealed no obvious differences in the proportions of all cell types 279 (Figure S5B-D) or ASPC subpopulations (Figure S5H-I) between room temperature and cold exposure. 280 Following cold exposure, all adipocyte subpopulations showed similar transcriptomes with those identified in 281\nthe longitudinal datasets (Figure S5G) and experienced a dramatic increase in the expression levels of BA 282 marker genes, including iBAT-ad4 which had not shown expression for any of those genes at room temperature 283 (Figure S5F). Proportion of the iBAT-ad1 subpopulation was increased while that of iBAT-ad3 decreased (Figure 284 S5E), indicating that cold exposure can induce cell type conversions among Ucp1+ adipocyte subpopulations in 285 iBAT, in agreement with previous observations (Song et al., 2020). In iWAT, analysis of 11,486 nuclei revealed 286 clusters of adipocytes, ASPCs, immune cells (macrophage, B cell, T cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell) and 287 vascular cells (endothelial cell and pericyte), whose relative proportions remained unchanged after cold 288 exposure (Figure S6A-E). Five subclusters were identified within the adipocyte population, herein termed 289 iWAT-ad1 to 5 (Figure S6F-H). As expected, the adipocytes expressing high levels of Ucp1 and Cidea (iWAT-290 ad1, namely BeAs) were only present in animals that were exposed to cold (Figure S6G). Surprisingly, a second 291 adipocyte subpopulation that was almost specific to cold exposed animals (iWAT-ad2) did not express any of 292 the common thermogenic markers, but instead specifically expressed genes involved in lipogenesis (Acss2, Fasn 293 and Acly) (Figure S6G-H). This is in agreement with a recent study showing that expression of lipogenic genes 294 is highly induced in iWAT adipocytes upon cold exposure (Holman et al., 2023). In contrast to iWAT-ad1 and 295 ad2, the abundance of iWAT-ad4 cells decreased by half following cold exposure (Figure S6G). Similar to 296 mPRAT and iBAT, no differences were detected in the proportions of different iWAT ASPCs subtypes following 297 cold exposure (Figure S6I-J). 298\nSurprisingly, little overlap, if at all, could be found between subpopulations of mPRAT and iWAT 299 adipocytes in mice housed at room temperature (Figure 6A-B). In fact, the mPRAT and iWAT adipocytes were 300 mostly exclusive from each other, besides the slight overlap between the 2 mature WA subpopulations (mPRAT-301 ad4 and iWAT-ad5) (Figure 6A-B). Thus, the cold-inducible subpopulation of mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes would 302 appear to be quite distinct from adipocyte subpopulations found in either iBAT or iWAT under room temperature 303 condition. Upon cold exposure, BeAs in iWAT (iWAT-ad1) showed a good correspondence with a fraction of 304 the mPRAT-ad1 subpopulation of BAs in mPRAT (highlighted in grey in Figure 6C-D). By label transfer, we 305 found that most of the mPRAT-ad1 adipocytes that did not overlap with iWAT BeAs were more similar to 306 mPRAT-ad2 of the room temperature dataset (highlighted in grey in Figure S6K), suggesting they may be 307 derived from mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes that had undergone brown-to-white conversion. Thus, mPRAT BAs that 308 arise from the mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation after cold exposure have a distinct transcriptome to that of cold-309 induced BeAs in iWAT. Analysis of the hierarchical relationships between different adipocyte subpopulations 310 in the three fat depots following cold exposure revealed that both the BA and WA populations of mPRAT were 311 more closely related to iBAT than iWAT populations (Figure 6E). As the ASPC population were rather similar 312 in the different depots at the different temperature conditions (Figure S4H, S5H, S6I), we performed cell\u2013cell 313 communication analysis on the populations of adipocyte in the three depots based on ligand, receptor and 314 cofactor interactions using the CellChat algorithm (Jin et al., 2021). At room temperature, mPRAT adipocyte 315 subpopulations showed greater and stronger intercellular communication than subpopulations in iBAT or iWAT 316 (Figure 6F-G), which may be related to the ongoing brown-to-white conversion in mPRAT at room temperature. 317 In contrast, cold exposure reverted these relationships, reducing the number and strength of interactions in 318 mPRAT while increasing interactions in iBAT and iWAT (Figure 6F-G). Thus, both under room temperature and 319 cold exposure conditions, mPRAT adipocytes display very different levels of cell-cell communication compared 320 to iBAT and iWAT adipocytes. 321\nDiscussion 322\nBrown-to-white conversion of BAs, also known as \u201cwhitening\u201d, has been observed in BAT of a number of 323\nmammalian species, including rat (Florez-Duquet et al., 1998; Horan et al., 1988; McDonald et al., 1988), rabbit 324 (Derry et al., 1972; Huang et al., 2022), bovine and ovine (Basse et al., 2015; Casteilla et al., 1989; Gemmell et 325 al., 1972), and human (Rogers, 2015). On the other hand, BA whitening does not occur in mouse iBAT as shown 326 in the present and previous studies (Huang et al., 2022). In PRAT, a continuous replacement of BAs by WAs 327 during aging has been suggested based on analysis of adipocyte morphology by a study on the Japanese 328 population (Tanuma et al., 1976). Also, so-called \u201cdormant\u201d BAT has been observed throughout the PRAT depot 329 of an adult kidney donor (Jespersen et al., 2019) and habituation to low-temperature environment has been 330 reported to result in acquisition of BA-like morphology and UCP1 expression in human PRAT (Efremova et al., 331 2020). In the present study, we used snRNA-seq to explore the transcriptome dynamics of mouse PRAT, 332 revealing the existence of brown-to-white conversion in the medial region of the tissue during postnatal 333 development, as confirmed by the loss of UCP1 protein in genetically traced adipocytes. Non-shivering 334 thermogenesis negatively correlates with body mass in a large number of eutherian mammals, as many of them 335 have developed other strategies to cope with low environmental temperatures, such as hibernation and 336 torpor(Oelkrug et al., 2015). On the other hand, small-sized mammals with large body surface to volume ratio 337 rely more heavily on BAT for thermogenesis, which may possibly explain why iBAT whitening does not occur 338 in mice. Although our demonstration of a whitening process in the mouse mPRAT would seem to run against 339 this notion, its deep visceral location suggests that the thermogenic capacity of this tissue may have other 340 physiological functions. The fact that the entire Ucp1-/Cidea+ mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation was able to become 341 Ucp1+ under short-term cold exposure suggests that a significant portion of mPRAT adipocytes retain 342 thermogenic capacity. 343\nAnalysis of the transcriptomes of the different adipocyte subpopulations in mPRAT revealed that their 344 ability to acquire a thermogenic phenotype in response to cold exposure was negatively correlated with the 345 extent to which they expressed WAT marker genes. Thus, while Cyp2e1, Slit3, Aldh1a1 and Lep were all 346 expressed by the majority of cold-resistant adipocytes in mPRAT-ad4, only some of the highly cold-responsive 347 Cidea+ cells in mPRAT-ad2 expressed Cyp2e1 and Slit3 and none expressed Aldh1a1 or Lep. On the other hand, 348 Cidea- cells in mPRAT-ad3, a small fraction of which can response to cold, were mostly positive for Cyp2e1 349 and Slit3, but did not express Aldh1a1 or Lep. The fact that mPRAT-ad2 cells express markers of both BA and 350 WA, together with an absence of unique markers for this subpopulation is in line with their intermediate and 351 plastic phenotype. Our tracing studies showed that only a rather small fraction of adipocytes undergoing brown-352 to-white conversion in postnatal life expressed mPRAT-ad3 and -ad4 markers CYP2E1 and ALDH1A1, 353 suggesting that the majority of mPRAT-ad3 and -ad4 WAs in PRAT must derive from differentiation of ASPCs. 354 This also agrees with them being most similar to iBAT-ad4 cells that also derive from ASPCs, given the lack of 355 brown-to-white conversion in the iBAT depot. ASPCs in both PRAT and iBAT were also very similar. We cannot 356 at present exclude the possibility that the limited cold-responsiveness of mPRAT-ad3 could be due to 357 inappropriate cold exposure for induction of a robust thermogenic phenotype. We also note that, although 358 Cyp2e1 and Aldh1a1 are always co-expressed in iBAT adipocytes (Sun et al., 2020), only Aldh1a1, not Cyp2e1, 359 distinguished cold-responsive from unresponsive adipocytes in mPRAT, indicating distinct expression patterns 360 and possibly functions for these genes in the two fat depots. 361\nmPRAT-ad2 cells shared with iWAT BeAs the capacity to upregulate Ucp1 expression and acquire a 362 thermogenic phenotype in response to cold (Petrovic et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2012). However, none of the 363 subpopulations of iWAT adipocytes showed any similarity to mPRAT-ad2 cells at the transcriptional level. This 364 convergent phenotype may be explained by the different origins of the two depots. Thus, while all adipocyte 365 subpopulations in iWAT arise by differentiation from ASPCs, mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes are derived from brown-366\nto-white conversion of BAs and thus retain a number of molecular signatures from their parental cells. Even 367 after cold exposure, the transcriptome of thermogenic BAs in PRAT (mPRAT-ad1) are more similar to BAs in 368 iBAT than iWAT. These BAs are likely composed of cells from three different origins: recruited mPRAT-ad2 369 adipocytes, pre-existing mPRAT-ad1 cells similar to iBAT BAs, and BAs that arise from cold-induced de novo 370 adipogenesis. iWAT BeAs derived by cold-induction are mainly derived from Sma-expressing precursor cells 371 (Berry et al., 2016), although interconversion between BeAs and WAs has also been observed after cold 372 exposure (Rosenwald et al., 2013). Distinct cellular and/or developmental origins may therefore explain the 373 differences observed among cold-induced adipocytes in the three depots. Adipocytes in BAT and iWAT are 374 known to have different developmental origins. While classical BAs from BAT depots are derived from a 375 subpopulation of dermomyotomes that expresses Myf5, En1 and Pax7 (Atit et al., 2006; Lepper and Fan, 2010; 376 Sanchez-Gurmaches et al., 2012; Seale et al., 2008), iWAT BeAs emerge from multiple origins, including a 377 Myf5-negative cell lineage derived from Myh11+ smooth muscle-like precursors (Long et al., 2014) and 378 progenitors expressing Pax3 and/or Myf5 (Sanchez-Gurmaches and Guertin, 2014). On the other hand, BAs in 379 PRAT arise from a lineage of Pax3+ but Myf5- cells (Sanchez-Gurmaches and Guertin, 2014). Discrepancies in 380 embryonic origin between mPRAT and iWAT beige adipocytes may have established unique transcriptome 381 signatures that persist during postnatal life. Another possibility is that the kinetics of thermogenic induction, 382 a.k.a. browning may be different between the two depots such that longer cold exposure results in more similar 383 transcriptional profiles in the two tissues. 384\nOne possible limitation of our study is that we only used mice from one genetic background (C57BL/6J), 385 which is known to display a metabolic phenotype that is more prone to develop obesity (Bachmann et al., 2022). 386 The transcriptomes and trajectories of cells from fat depots of other strains may deviate from our findings. In 387 addition, the oldest mice that we have analyzed in the present study were 6-month-old, which is only equivalent 388 to the human adult stage. Future studies should focus on older mice to investigate whether a more complete 389 brown-to-white conversion takes place during aging as well as the effect of cold exposure on this process. 390 Moreover, lack of specific marker genes for the mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation makes it difficult to generate Cre 391 driver strains that can be used to specifically trace the fate of these adipocytes and visualize the whitening 392 process in a more direct way. 393\nIn summary, our work identifies a cold-recruitable adipocyte subpopulation in mPRAT derived by brown-394 to-white conversion of BAs with a transcriptomic profile distinct from iWAT BeAs. The discrepancy observed 395 in this process between pvPRAT and puPRAT could be functionally related to the idiosyncrasies of kidney blood 396 supply and urine transport, respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated the clinical relevance of PRAT in 397 clear cell renal cell carcinoma invasion (Wei et al., 2021) and pathological hypertension (Li et al., 2022). Future 398 studies should focus on exploring the physiological role of brown-to-white conversion in different regions of 399 mPRAT and the molecular mechanisms that govern its regulation. Understanding why mPRAT has pre-existing 400 BAs that gradually convert to WAs during postnatal development may contribute to the development of novel 401 therapeutic strategies for renal disorders. More generally, harnessing our understanding of brown-to-white 402 adipocyte conversion may lead to strategies to prevent or delay its course and thus enhance the thermogenic 403 capacity of adipose tissues to mitigate the consequences of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes. 404\nAcknowledgments 405\nThe authors thank Dr. Zhinan Yin, Jinan University for providing the Ucp1CreERT2 mouse strain.

All codes to repeat snRNA-seq analysis were in the 421 GitHub repository (https://github.com/HouyuZhang/PRAT_project). 422\nMaterials and methods 423\nAnimals 424\nAll animal experiments were performed in compliance with the protocol approved by the Institutional 425 Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Peking University (Psych-XieM-2) and the Chinese Institute of 426 Brain Research (CIBR-IACUC-035). C57BL/6J mice were housed under a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle with free 427 access to food and water. For all cold exposure experiments, animals were housed individually in a temperature 428 and light-controlled incubator (Darth Carter, Hefei, China). Ucp1Cre (JAX:024670) (Kong et al., 2014), 429 PdfraCreERT2 (JAX:018280) and Ai14 (JAX:007914) (Madisen et al., 2010) strains were purchased from 430 Jackson Laboratory. Ucp1CreERT2 strain (Rosenwald et al., 2013) was a gift from Dr. Zhinan Yin, Jinan 431 University, China. For genetic tracing, tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. T5648) dissolved in corn oil 432 (Solarbio, Cat. No. C7030) was intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 2 mg per animal per day for 4 433 (UCP1CreERT2) or 5 (PdfraCreERT2) consecutive days. All animals used in the present study are male. 434\nDissection of mouse PRAT 435\nlPRAT was separated from the mPRAT by a thin layer of fascia membrane at both the anterior and posterior 436 renal capsule pole. The adrenal gland and surrounding adipose tissue located at the anterior renal capsule pole 437 were surgically removed by cutting along the fascia membrane on the lateral side and the anterior renal hilum 438 edge on the medial side. mPRAT was defined as the adipose tissue located between the anterior renal hilum 439 edge and the posterior renal capsule pole. Within the mPRAT, peri-vascular PRAT (pvPRAT) was defined as the 440 adipose tissue located between the anterior and posterior renal hilum edge that wraps the renal vessels, and peri-441 ureter PRAT (puPRAT) was defined as the adipose tissue located between the posterior renal hilum edge and 442\nthe posterior renal capsule pole that wraps the ureter. For histological analysis, the entire PRAT together with 443 the kidney was taken for sectioning to accurately define different regions of the tissue using the kidney as a 444 landmark. 445\nNuclei isolation for snRNA-seq 446\nNuclei isolation from adipose tissue was performed according to a published protocol with slight 447 modification (Van Hauwaert et al., 2021). Briefly, adipose tissues were minced in a petri dish containing 500 448 mL nuclei isolation buffer (NIB) that contains 250 mM sucrose (Solarbio, Cat. No. S8271), 10 mM HEPES 449 (Solarbio, Cat. No. H8090), 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. M8266), 10 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, 450 Cat. No. P5405), 0.001% IGEPAL CA-630 (NP-40) (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. I3021), 0.2 mM DTT (Sigma-451 Aldrich, Cat. No. D9779), and 1 U/\u03bcL RNase inhibitor (Solarbio, Cat. No. R8061) in DEPC-treated water. The 452 samples were further homogenized using a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. D8938), 453 applying three strokes with the loose pestle. The homogenate was filtered through a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon, 454 Cat. No. 352350) and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 2 mL NIB 455 and centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min at 4\u00b0C. Finally, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 300 \u03bcL nuclei 456 resuspension buffer that contains 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. A1933), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 U/\u03bcL RNase 457 inhibitor in PBS. All solutions were sterile filtered prior to use. All procedures were performed on ice. 458\nsnRNA-seq library construction and sequencing 459\nNuclei suspensions were stained with 10 \u03bcg/mL 7-AAD (Invitrogen, Cat. No. A1310) and sorted on a BD 460 Fusion Flow Cytometer (BD FACSMelody\u21224-Way Cell Sorter) with a 100 \u00b5m nozzle. Nuclei were counted 461 using a Countstar Automated Cell Counter (Countstar Rigel S5) and approximately 20,000 nuclei per sample 462 were loaded into the 10x Chromium system using the Single-Cell 3\u2032 Reagent Kit v3.1 according to the 463 manufacturer\u2019s instructions (10x Genomics). GEM-Reverse Transcription was performed with a thermal cycler 464 using the following program: 53\u2103 for 45 minutes, 85\u2103 for 5 minutes, and held at 4\u2103. After reverse 465 transcription and cell barcoding, emulsions were lysed and cDNA was isolated and purified with Cleanup Mix 466 containing DynaBeads and SPRIselect reagent (Thermo Scientific), followed by PCR amplification. The cDNA 467 was then evaluated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection were applied to 468 optimize the cDNA amplicon size. Then, the P5, P7, i7 and i5 sample indexes and TruSeq Read 2 (read 2 primer 469 sequence) were added by end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and PCR. The final libraries containing the P5 470 and P7 primers were sequenced by an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer with 150 bp paired-end reads, aiming 471 for a coverage of approximately 50,000 raw reads per nucleus. 472\nsnRNA-seq data analysis 473\nRaw fastq sequencing data were processed using Cell Ranger version 7.0.0 with the \u201c--include-introns\u201d 474 parameter to include reads mapped to introns from Ensembl annotation. The reference genomes used for mouse 475 was mm10. The raw nuclei-gene count matrices were processed by CellBender version 0.2.2 (Fleming et al., 476 2023) to remove ambient RNA contamination and empty droplets. The processed count matrices that include 477 validated nuclei were used for downstream analyses with Seurat version 4.3.0 (Hao et al., 2021). 478\nFor single dataset pre-processing, we removed low-quality nuclei according to the following criteria: 1. 479 nuclei contain less than 500 or more than 6000 genes; 2. nuclei contain more than 15% of total reads from 480 mitochondrial genes; 3. nuclei contain less than 1000 or more than 50000 UMI counts. Then, genes expressed 481 in less than 10 nuclei were removed. Doublet score was calculated using DoubletFinder version 2.0.3 (McGinnis 482 et al., 2019) and 8% of the nuclei that had the highest doublet score were removed according to 10x Genomics\u2019 483\nrecommendation. The \u201cLogNormalize\u201d function was used to perform normalization and z-scale was performed 484 using the \u201cScaleData\u201d function. Highly variable genes (HVGs) were calculated by the Variance-Stabilizing 485 Transformation algorithm and the top 2000 HVGs for each dataset were used for downstream analysis. Kidney-486 related cells and lymphocytes that come from contaminations during dissection were removed from the datasets 487 prior to further analysis. 488\nFor multiple dataset integration, the Canonical Correlation Analysis algorithm was used. Specifically, the 489 \u201cSelectIntegrationFeatures\u201d and \u201cFindIntegrationAnchors\u201d functions were used to find integration features 490 based on HVGs and multiple datasets were integrated using the \u201cIntegrateData\u201d function in Seurat. Principal 491 component analysis (PCA) was performed using the \u201cRunPCA\u201d function to obtain the first 30 principal 492 components. Nuclei were then projected into the low dimensional space using the Uniform Manifold 493 Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm. Nuclei clusters were defined using the Louvain algorithm 494 via the \u201cFindClusters\u201d function. Data embedding for UMAP clustering was performed according to the top 495 2,000 variable genes and the first 30 principal components. Marker genes for each cluster were calculated using 496 the \u201cFindAllMarkers\u201d function by a Wilcox test (log2 fold change > 0.25) and clusters were manually annotated 497 either based on marker genes reported in literature or by searching top markers genes against the PanglaoDB 498 database (Franzen et al., 2019). Marker gene lists for all datasets were summarized in Table S1 499 (https://github.com/HouyuZhang/PRAT_project/blob/main/Supplementary_Table1_Marker_gene_lists_for_all500 _datasets.xlsx). 501\nThe low-dimensional dataset from Seurat was applied to Monocle version 3 (Cao et al., 2019) for trajectory 502 inference using the partitioned approximate graph abstraction algorithm. A principal graph-embedding 503 procedure based on the SimplePPT algorithm was applied via the \u201clearn_graph\u201d function to learn a principal 504 graph representing the possible paths that the nuclei can take as they progress. Once the trajectories were defined, 505 we manually selected the root node that resides specific population. For the time-series mPRAT trajectory 506 analysis, we defined root node resides the Ucp1 highest as the starting point. Pseudo-time for each nucleus was 507 computed as its geodesic distance back to our defined root nodes in the trajectory using the principal graph as a 508 guide. Then, spatial correlation analysis by the Moran\u2019s I test was conducted via the \u201cgraph_test\u201d function to 509 find DEGs across our defined trajectory. 510\nFor cluster similarity analysis, top 50 marker genes ranked by q-value from the reference cluster were 511 selected as a gene module, then the module score for each cell of the query cluster was calculated by the 512 \u201cAddModuleScore_UCell\u201d function (Andreatta and Carmona, 2021). A label transfer method from Seurat was 513 used to learn annotations among snRNA-seq dataset. Specifically, the \u201cFindTransferAnchors\u201d function was 514 used between reference dataset and query dataset to find anchors, which were further used to annotate each cell 515 in query dataset by the annotation in reference dataset by the \u201cTransferData\u201d function. 516\nDEGs between two clusters were calculated using the \u201cFindMarkers\u201d function in Seurat. Specifically, 517 genes expressed in more than 10% of cells of either cluster were compared by a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The 518 \u201ccompareCluster\u201d and \u201cenrichGO\u201d function of the clusterProfiler version 4.8.1 (Wu et al., 2021) was used to 519 find enriched gene ontology (GO) pathways using the species-specific annotation database (org.Mm.eg.db). The 520 Benjamini-Hochberg methods were used for p-value correction with 0.05 as a threshold. For mPRAT-RT and 521 mPRAT-CE analysis, the Metascape website version 3.5 (Zhou et al., 2019) was used to predict gene regulatory 522 network (GRN) and functional enrichment against GO, KEGG, Reactome and WikiPathways database. 523\nThe cell-cell communication analysis was conducted with CellChat version 1.6.0 using the mouse database. 524 The \u201ccomputeCommunProbPathway\u201d function was used to compute the communication probability on 525\nsignaling pathway level by summarizing all related ligands or receptors, p-value < 0.05 was used to determine 526 significant interactions. 527\nGene Expression Analysis 528\nTotal RNA was extracted from snap-frozen adipose tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 529 15596018). cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of RNA using the H Minus cDNA first strand synthesis kit 530 (Thermo Scientific, Cat. No. K1652). Relative mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR using 531 the PowerUpTM SYBR TM Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Cat. No. A25742) in a CFX96TM Real-532 Time PCR Detection System (Biorad). Cq values were normalized to levels of Ywhaz using the \u0394\u0394-Ct method. 533 The primer sequences are as following: mouse Ucp1 forward 5\u2019-GGCCTCTACGACTCAGTCCA-3\u2019, reverse 534 5\u2019-TAAGCCGGCTGAGATCTTGT-3\u2019; mouse Ywhaz forward 5\u2019-CAGTAGATGGAGAAAGATTTGC-3\u2019, 535 reverse 5\u2019-GGGACAATTAGGGAAGTAAGT-3\u2019. 536\nImmunoblotting and antibodies 537\n0.3 mL of 100% ethanol was added to the collected interphase and lower organic layer from the TRIzol 538 lysate and incubated for 3 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet the 539 DNA. The phenol-ethanol supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 1.5 mL of isopropanol was added. 540 After a 10-minute incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet the proteins. 541 The pellet was washed three times with a washing solution consisting of 0.3 M guanidine hydrochloride 542 (Solarbio, Cat. No. G8070) in 95% ethanol, followed by one more wash with 100% ethanol. The protein pellet 543 was air-dried and resuspended in 200\u00b5L of 1% SDS (Solarbio, Cat. No. S8010) at 50\u00b0C in a heating block. 544 Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Solarbio, Cat. No. PC0020) in a Cytation 545 5 imaging reader (Thermo Fisher). Protein samples were prepared using the Laemmli buffer (Biorad, Cat. No. 546 1610747), supplemented with 20% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 98\u00b0C. Reducing SDS-PAGE gel was made 547 using the SDS-PAGE Gel kit (Biorad, Cat. No. 1610183). 15 \u03bcg sample was loaded into SDS-PAGE gel and 548 transferred onto PVDF membranes (Biorad, Cat. No. 1620177). The blots were processed with a 549 chemiluminescence HRP Substrate (Millipore, Cat. No. WBKLS05000) and imaged with the Amersham 550 ImageQuant 800 Western blot imaging system. Intensity of target bands were quantified using the ImageJ 551 version 1.53k. 552\nThe antibodies and the working concentrations are as follows: UCP1: 1:1000 dilution (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. 553 No. U6382), \u03b1-tubulin: 1:1000 dilution (Santa Sruz, Cat. No. sc-8035), anti-rabbit IgG: 1:2000 dilution (Cell 554 Signaling, Cat.

No. G1003). For Tunel staining, sections were deparaffinized 559 and rehydrated by serial xylene and ethanol before antigen retrieval. Then, sections were permeabilized using 560 PBS with 0.1% Triton and blocked with 3% BSA. Tunel Assay Kit (Servicebio, Cat. No. G1501) was used to 561 detect DNA breaks formed during apoptosis. Perilipin-1 at 1:100 dilution (Cell Signaling, Cat. No. 9349S) was 562 used to stain all adipocytes. DAPI was used to stain nuclei. 563\nImmunofluorescence staining 564\nWhole-mount immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (Jiang et al., 2018). Briefly, 565\nmice were anesthetized and perfused with PBS, before being sacrificed for adipose tissue dissection followed 566 by overnight fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C. The tissues were washed in PBS containing 0.01% tween-567 20 (PBST) before being embedded in 5% low-melting agarose and sectioned into 100-400 \u03bcm-thick slices using 568 a Vibratome (Leica, VT1200). Slices were blocked and permeabilized using PBST supplemented with 5% 569 donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X at room temperature for 30 minutes. If necessary, the M.O.M. Blocking 570 Reagent (Vector, Cat. No. MKB-2213-1) was applied to block mouse endogenous IgG for background reduction. 571 The following antibodies and chemicals were used: rabbit-host UCP1, 1:100 (Sigma Aldrich, Cat.

Images were processed and analyzed using 577 the Imaris software (Bitplane version 9.0.1). 578\nWhole tissue immunostaining and optical clearing 579\nWhole tissue optical clearing and immunostaining were performed following the previously published 580 ImmuView method (Ding et al., 2019). Briefly, mice were anesthetized and perfused with PBS. The kidney and 581 all surrounding adipose tissues (mPRAT and lPRAT) were collected and fixed in PBS containing 0.5% PFA and 582 10% sucrose at room temperature for 2 hours. After serial dehydration and rehydration in methanol of different 583 concentrations, the tissues were permeabilized and blocked overnight using PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 584 10% DMSO (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. No. D8418), 5% donkey serum and 10 mM EDTA-Na at room temperature, 585 followed by immunolabelling with UCP1 primary antibody (1:100, Sigma Aldrich, Cat. No. U6382) in a PBS-586 based dilution buffer containing 0.2% Tween-20, 10 mg/mL heparin (Solarbio, Cat. No. H8060), 5% donkey 587 serum and 10 mM EDTA-Na (pH 8.0) for three days at room temperature. Then, the tissues were washed with 588 a washing buffer (PBS with 0.2% Tween-20, 10 mg/mL heparin and 10 mM EDTA-Na) for 12 hours at 37\u00b0C. 589 Washing buffer was changed every 2 hours during the washing period. Alexa Fluor 555 rabbit IgG H&L 590 secondary antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen, Cat. No. A31572) was used for primary antibody detection by 591 incubation at room temperature for three days, followed by a 2-day-washing at 37\u00b0C with washing buffer being 592 changed every 8 hours. For tissue clearing, the immunolabeled tissues were embedded in 0.8% agarose and 593 incubated at room temperature with increasing concentrations of methanol. The tissue blocks were then 594 incubated at room temperature with a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (2:1) for 4 hours, followed by 595 incubation in 100% dichloromethane for 1.5 hours. The tissue blocks were finally incubated at room temperature 596 with 100% dibenzyl ether (DBE) for 24 hours. All incubation steps were performed with gentle shaking. 597\nSamples were imaged with an Ultramicroscope II light-sheet microscope (LaVision Biotec) equipped with 598 a sCMOs camera (Andor Neo). Images were acquired with the ImspectorPro software (LaVision BioTec). 599 Samples were placed in an imaging reservoir filled with DBE and illuminated from the side by the laser light 600 sheet. The samples were scanned with the 640-nm laser, with a step-size of 3 \u03bcm for 4X objectives. Images 601 were processed using the Imaris software (Bitplane version 9.0.1). 602\nStatistical analysis 603\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0. Results were presented as mean 604 \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). One-way or two-way ANOVA was used to test statistical significance for qPCR, 605 western blot and immunofluorescence quantification as specified in the corresponding figure legends. The level 606 of statistical significance was assigned as * for P <0.05, ** for P<0.01, *** for P<0.001, **** for P<0.0001. 607\nFigures 608\nFigure. 1 snRNA-seq reveals a unique adipocyte subpopulation and delineates a brown-to-white 609 transition process in mPRAT during postnatal development 610\n(A) UMAP of all cell types in mPRAT from 1-, 2- and 6-month-old C57BL/6J male mice.
