    "abstractText": "We present a detailed study on detector response to different radioactive sources and the measurements of nonreactor environmental backgrounds with the Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN) detector setup consisting of 9\u00d710 Plastic Scintillator Bars (PSBs) array at BARC, Mumbai. These measurements are useful in the context of the ISMRAN detector setup, which will be used to detect the reactor anti-neutrinos (\u03bde) and measure its energy spectra, through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. A GEANT4 based Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used to understand the optical transmission, energy resolution and energy non-linearity of the ISMRAN detector. A detailed analysis procedure has been developed to understand the natural radioactive, cosmogenic and cosmic muoninduced backgrounds with the ISMRAN detector setup in a non-reactor environment, based on their energy deposition, number of bars hit as well as topological event selection criteria in position and time for triggered events. Data and MC simulated distributions of reconstructed sum energy and number of bars hit has been compared for the radioactive \u03b3 + positron source such as 22Na placed at the center of the ISMRAN array. Fast neutron energy response and capture time distribution in ISMRAN array has been studied using a novel technique involving Time of Flight (TOF) of the measured fast neutrons. The observed characteristic neutron capture time ( \u03c4 ) of 68.29 \u00b1 9.48 \u03bcs is in good agreement with \u223c65 \u03bcs obtained from MC simulation. These experimentally measured results will be useful for discriminating the correlated and uncorrelated background events from the true IBD events in reactor ON and OFF conditions inside the reactor hall.",

Experimental collaborations such as Daya Bay [3], RENO [4] and Double Chooz [5] have\nachieved detailed and precise measurements of \u03bde energy spectrum and \u03b813 [6, 7]. However, from the comparisons between the theoretical models and the experimental results, a \u223c 6 % deficit is observed in the global reactor \u03bde flux, which is known as \u201creactor anti-neutrino anomaly\u201d (RAA) [8, 9, 10, 11]. A disagreement with the expected shape of reactor \u03bde induced prompt positron energy spectrum between 5\u22127 MeV with a local significance of up to \u223c4\u03c3, has also been observed, which is known as \u201cshape distortion\u201d or \u201c5 MeV bump\u201d [12, 13]. The observed flux deficit RAA has led to the hypothesis of oscillations involving a sterile neutrino state with \u223c 1eV2 mass splitting or reasons of it may also lie in the complex nuclear physics of reactors [14]. However, many ongoing effort for the search of eV-scale sterile neutrinos at very short baseline experiments (\u223c 10m) have reported significant exclusions in the parameter space of mixing angle (sin2(2\u03b814)) and mass splitting (\u2206m241). Some of these experiments are also sensitive to monitor the reactor power in a non-intrusive way and estimate the fuel compositions as a function of burn up [15, 16].\nTo explore these aspects, an array of plastic scintillator bars (PSBs) known as Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor\nAnti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN), has been installed and commissioned at Dhruva research reactor facility [17] in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), which uses natural uranium as fuel, at \u223c13 m from the reactor core . It is designed to measure the yield and energy spectrum of \u03bde, via the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. The measured spectra can be used for the searching of the sterile neutrino with a mass on the order of \u223c1 eV /c2 [18, 19]. With the ISMRAN detector setup the active sterile neutrino oscillation can be observed with a 95% confidence level provided that sin22\u03b814 \u2265 0.09 at \u2206m241 = 1 for an exposure of 1 ton-year [20]. At the same time, the monitoring of the reactor thermal power and fuel evolution can be demonstrated using the measured \u03bde yields as a function of time [21, 22, 23, 24]. The excess of \u03bde events in data compared to the predictions particularly between 5\u22127 MeV in the measured prompt positron energy spectrum will also be addressed using ISMRAN detector setup [25, 26, 27]. A first measurement of \u03bde candidate events with a prototype detector, mini-ISMRAN consisting of 1/16th of the original ISMRAN, was installed and successfully recorded data inside the Dhruva reactor hall in the year 2018. A total of 218 \u00b1 50 (stat) \u00b1 37 (sys) \u03bde candidate events were obtained for 128 days of reactor ON data [28]. The physics data collection has already started\nwith the full scale ISMRAN detector setup at the end of the year 2021.\nThe ISMRAN detector setup, consists of an array of plastic scintillator bars (PSBs) arranged in 9\u00d710 (9 horizontals and 10 verticals) matrix and enclosed by a shielding made of 10 cm thick lead (Pb) and 10 cm thick borated\npolyethylene (BP) with 30% boron concentration, to minimize the influence of reactor backgrounds resulting from the\nphotons and neutrons inside the reactor hall. From MC simulations it is estimated that a moderate shielding of 10 cm of Pb and 10 cm of BP has a rejection of up to \u223c 88% for the fast neutron events, within the energy range of 2 MeV to 10 MeV, inside the shielding structure [29]. This choice of shielding is optimized by keeping the tonnage limitation\nof the massive shielding structures on the floor of the reactor hall. The complete setup is mounted on a movable base\nstructure which will allow us to make the measurements at different distances from the reactor core. Similar setup using an array of PSBs has been used by the PANDA experiment at a stand off distance of \u223c25 m from the reactor core and have reported promising results [24]. The DANSS collaboration has also demonstrated the performance of\nsolid plastic strip scintillators for the reactor \u03bde detection [30].\nApart from reactor background, natural radioactive, cosmogenic and cosmic muon-induced backgrounds have\nalso been encountered inside the reactor hall. Therefore a good understanding of cosmogenic background as well as natural radioactive background that constitutes the \u03b3-rays mainly from 40K and 208Tl in plastic scintillator array is an\nessential pre-requisite to estimate their uncertainties in the measurements. This has been performed through a detailed\nmeasurement of non-reactor background with plastic scintillator array at the Detector Integration Laboratory (DIL) in\nBARC, without using any shielding structure in a non-reactor environment, which is situated about 1.5 km away from\nthe Dhruva reactor hall.\nIn this paper, we present the results obtained from the comparison between data and GEANT4 based MC sim-\nulations which incorporate the optical transmission of the scintillation photons, energy resolution and energy non-\nlinearity for PSB. We also discuss the response of the detector to natural radioactive, cosmogenic and cosmic muon-\ninduced backgrounds, based on their sum energy distribution and number of bars hit for the triggered events inside\nthe ISMRAN array. Reconstructed sum energy spectrum and number of bars hit for \u03b3-rays + positron coming from radioactive source such as 22Na has been compared with MC simulations by placing it at the center of the ISMRAN\narray. Comparison between neutron capture on hydrogen (n-H) events and accidental background events have been\nstudied in detail based on their sum energy and number of bars hit variable using a Am/Be neutron source, placed on the top of the ISMRAN array. The reconstructed \u223c2.2 MeV \u03b3-ray from n-H capture events from the cosmogenic neutron background or cosmic muon spallated secondary neutron will be useful for monitoring the energy scale stability\nof ISMRAN detectors inside the reactor hall. The sum energy, number of bars hit, individual PSB energy and energy\ndeposition ratio variables are reconstructed for the cascade \u03b3-rays from the neutron capture on Gadolinium (n-Gd)\ncapture process using Am/Be neutron source and compared with the MC simulations in GEANT4. We also study the\nenergy response of fast neutrons in PSBs, generated from Am/Be source using Time of Flight (TOF) technique where\nwe can identify the fast neutron induced events from \u03b3-ray events. These tagged fast neutrons from TOF are then used\nto measure the capture time distribution using a novel technique for the n-Gd capture events in the ISMRAN array\nand the results are compared with the MC simulations."

The interaction of \u03bde with protons present in PSB generates a positron and a neutron as daughter particles via IBD process, as shown in Eq. 1.\n\u03bde + p\u2192 e+ + n. (1)\nThe minimum \u03bde energy required for the above reaction to occur is \u223c1.8 MeV. The positron being lighter in mass as compared to neutron, carries most of the \u03bde\u2019s energy, leaving a few keV\u2019s of energy for the neutron. The positron looses energy, through ionization in the PSB followed by annihilation with a surrounding electron, resulting in emission of\ntwo \u03b3-rays of energy 0.511 MeV each. The signal produced by the energy loss of positron and the Compton scattered\n\u03b3-rays from the annihilation comprise the prompt event signature. On the other hand, the neutron which has only a\nfew keV\u2019s of energy, loses its energy through multiple scattering and eventually thermalize in the scintillator volume\nand gets captured either in Gadolinium (Gd) foils or in Hydrogen (H) present in the scintillator volume.\nn + 155Gd\u2192 156Gd\u2217 \u2192 \u03b3\u2032s, \u2211 E\u03b3 = 8.5 MeV, \u03c3n\u2212capture = 61000 b, (2)\nn + 157Gd\u2192 158Gd\u2217 \u2192 \u03b3\u2032s, \u2211 E\u03b3 = 7.9 MeV, \u03c3n\u2212capture = 254000 b. (3)\nDue to the larger thermal neutron capture cross-section for Gd nuclei, as shown in Eqs. 2 and 3, from simulations it has been observed that \u223c75% of the events are captured on Gd nuclei and rest \u223c25% events are captured on H nuclei in ISMRAN detector geometry [29]. The neutron capture on H nuclei emitting a mono-energetic \u03b3-ray of\nenergy 2.2 MeV is difficult to tag as a delayed partner due to the presence of reactor related \u03b3-ray background in that energy region. However, the de-excitation of the Gd nucleus leads to emission of cascade \u03b3-rays of sum energy \u223c8 MeV, forms much robust delayed event signature. The sum energy depositions for the prompt positron and delayed\nneutron capture events along with the selection of number of bars hit uniquely identifies the \u03bde candidate events in ISMRAN array, as shown in Fig. 2. Also, the characteristic time difference (\u03c4) between the prompt and the delayed event signatures, is of the order of \u223c68 \u00b5s for the ISMRAN detector geometry obtained from MC simulations, which can discriminate the \u03bde from other correlated and uncorrelated background events [29]."

            "text": "A good understanding of the response of the PSB is an essential pre-requisite for the analysis presented in this\npaper. In MC simulations, based on GEANT4 [32], the standard electromagnetic and radioactive decays physics\nprocesses are used for the response of \u03b3-rays, electrons and positrons from radioactive sources. The high precision\nQGSP BIC HP physics processes is used for the low energy neutron interactions in GEANT4 based MC simulation.\nBy default GEANT4 package used photon evaporation model to simulate cascade \u03b3-rays emission from the thermal\nneutron capture on Gd nucleus. However, in photon evaporation model the final sum energy of the captured event\nis conserved, but event-by-event individual cascade \u03b3-rays distribution is not properly modeled. To get an accurate\ndescription of cascade \u03b3-rays emission from the thermal neutron capture on Gd in our simulation studies, we have used\nthe DICEBOX package which models the emission of cascade \u03b3-rays from the region of high energy level density in\nan excited nucleus, based on the different models of energy level density and photon strength functions [33, 34]. To\nobtain the uniform response of the measured signal in data among all the PSBs, a gain matching of PMTs is performed\nand the energy, timing and position characterization of each PSB is done independently. The middle of each PSB is\nconsidered as the center position at 0 cm and both extreme ends are taken as -50 cm and +50 cm, respectively. Using\nthe timestamp information from both the PMTs coupled at the ends of each PSB, we can reconstruct the timing difference (\u2206TLR) and parameterize an approximate position (Zpos) by placing a 137Cs source at 9 different positions, from -40 cm to +40 cm with the step size of 10 cm, along the length of the PSB. Using this parametrization we can reconstruct the hit position distribution along the length of the PSB. The measured timing resolution of \u223c4 ns leads to a parameterized position resolution of \u223c20 cm in a single PSB [29, 35] and is almost uniform among the different bars. Due to the segmented geometry of the ISMRAN detector, we can exploit the timing and position information\nfor the localization of an event in the ISMRAN array to differentiate an \u03bde event from a background event arising due to fast neutron [36, 37]. The complex absorption and re-emission processes of optical photons are known to be\nan important source of the non-linear and non-uniform response of the charge deposition in the PSBs. Therefore, a\ngood understanding of light propagation in PSB is desirable to model the detector response and reduce the systematic\nerrors. In order to get the optical model for ISMRAN detectors, optical photons have been simulated, by placing different radioactive sources such as 137Cs, 22Na and \u03b3-rays from Am/Be sources at the center of the PSB, using\noptical physics process in GEANT4. The optical photons inside the scintillator volume are then propagated to the\nPMTs and the digitized output are then compared with the measured integrated charge spectra obtained from the data.\nFigure 3 (a), (b) and (c) show the comparisons between data and MC for integrated charge spectrum from all the three radioactive sources, namely 137Cs, 22Na and \u03b3-ray from Am/Be, respectively. A reasonable agreement between data\nand MC simulated events for the integrated charge spectrum in PSB from radioactive \u03b3-ray sources are observed with an average \u03c72 of the order of \u223c0.4 in each case. A small differences, between data and MC generated events, observed in 137Cs and 22Na spectra at lower integrated charge range are mainly due to the absence of natural background\ncomponent and the implementation of the individual PSB thresholds in the MC generated simulated events.\nTo obtain the energy resolution in PSB, the energy deposition (Ebar) has been simulated for different radioactive sources, such as 137Cs, 22Na and \u03b3-ray from Am/Be source, in a single PSB using radioactive decay physics process\nin GEANT4. The simulated Ebar is then smeared using a Gaussian approximation whose \u03c3 value are obtained from\nthe energy dependent resolution function as shown in eq 4.\nResolution ( \u03c3E Ebar ) = \u221a A2 + B2 Ebar + C2 E2bar , (4)\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 in MeVbarE\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\nN o rm\na liz\ne d C\no u n ts\nData MC simulation\n(a) Cs137\n0.5 1 1.5 in MeVbarE\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\nN o rm\na liz\ne d C\no u n ts Data MC simulation\n(b) Na22\n4 4.2 4.4 4.6 in MeVbarE\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015 0.02 N o rm a liz e d C o u n ts\nData MC simulation\n(c) )\u03b3AmBe(\nFigure 4: Panels (a), (b) and (c) show the comparisons of the calibrated Ebar distribution, in a single PSB, between data and MC simulation from 137Cs, 22Na and \u03b3-ray Am/Be radioactive sources, respectively.\nwhere the first term (A) is dependent on the light collection inefficiency variations, the second term (B) represents\nthe energy dependent photo-statistics, and the third term (C) is related to PMT and electronics noise [38, 39]. Figure 4 (a), (b) and (c) show the comparisons between measured Ebar spectra from data and MC simulated events for 137Cs, 22Na and \u03b3-rays from Am/Be source, respectively. The comparisons of Ebar between the data and MC events of a single PSB for different radioactive sources are reasonably in good agreement and the \u03c72 are tabulated in table 1.\nThe disagreement between data and simulated results at lower energy range are mainly due to the absence of natural\nbackground component in the simulation results.\nFigure 5 (a) displays the energy dependent resolution model with reconstructed \u03b3-ray energy for 137Cs, 22Na\nand \u03b3-rays from Am/Be source in a single PSB. These results indicate that energy resolution of ISMRAN is well\ndescribed by the standard resolution formula, which is shown in Eqs. 4, and that the photo-statistics term is the primary determinant of achieved energy resolution for ISMRAN, which is \u223c14%/ \u221a Ebar. Figure 5 (b) shows the nonlinear response of scintillating energy in a single PSB for different radioactive \u03b3-rays sources, that is well described by a\nfitted parametrization and consistent with the MC predictions. The nonlinear response at lower energies is mainly due\nto the quenching effect in the scintillator volume [38, 39]. The following empirical formula as shown in Eq. 5 is used\nfor the description of the energy non-linearity of PSB,\nEbar Etrue = p \u2212 q [1 \u2212 e\u2212(rEtrue+s)] (5)\nwhere Etrue is true energy, in MeV, representing the Compton energy of \u03b3-rays originating from different radioactive sources and Ebar corresponds to the reconstructed energy in a single PSB. The fit parameters p determines the saturation level, q corresponds to the magnitude of non-linearity, r and s are related to the shape of the non-linearity [39].\nThe Ebar is obtained by calibrating each PSB using \u03b3-rays and their respective Compton edges from radioactive sources such as 22Na and 137Cs placed at the center of the PSB. For higher energy calibration point we have used the\n4.4 MeV \u03b3-ray from the Am/Be source. Figure 6 (a),(b) and (c) show the Compton edges among all the 90 PSBs for 137Cs, 22Na and Am/Be, respectively. Uniformity in the calibrated energy deposition is observed among all the 90 PSBs for different energy ranges with a variation of \u223c3% among bars."

            "text": "One of the dominant source of background for the detection of \u03bde events in an above ground reactor \u03bde experiment is the presence of the interfering cosmic muon-induced and natural radioactive background. Before the reconstruction\nof the \u03bde events, all the events which satisfies the prompt and delayed event selection criteria are termed as promptlike and delayed-like events, respectively. Two main background sources for the \u03bde candidate events arise from the uncorrelated and correlated pairs of prompt-like and delayed-like events. The uncorrelated background is due to\nthe accidental coincidences from the random association of a prompt-like event due to natural radioactivity, with a\ndelayed-like neutron capture event from background. The sources of prompt-like background events are from the\n\u03b3-rays from the radioactivity in the PMT glasses, PSB, and high energy \u03b3-rays emanating from the neutron captures\non the surrounding material, mostly iron, inside the reactor hall [40]. The ambient radioactivities generate \u03b3-rays\nranges in energy below 3 MeV. The delayed-like background events come from the neutrons produced by cosmic\nmuons in the surrounding walls, shielding material, or inside the ISMRAN detector. The correlated \u03bde background events are due to the fast neutrons, \u03b2-n emitters from cosmogenic 9Li/8He isotopes and radioactive isotopes such as 12B/12N [41]. An energetic neutron entering the ISMRAN array can mimic the prompt-like event signature by proton\nrecoil energy deposition and followed by thermalization and capture on Gd providing the delayed-like event signature. By exploiting the nature of the energy deposition profile in PSBs for the measured fast neutrons from D\u2212D and D\u2212T reactions and simulated prompt event from \u03bde, a separation of these fast neutron background events are demonstrated in ref [37].\nIn order to understand and discriminate the non-reactor background, a detailed measurement of the non-reactor\nbackground with ISMRAN array has been accomplished at the DIL in BARC, without using any shielding structure.\nThe characterization of different non-reactor backgrounds are done on the basis of cell arrangement, consisting of 9\nPSBs in each cell, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). These cells configuration are implemented in the offline analysis only and not\nin the trigger while taking data. The 9 cells arrangement in the analysis is particularly chosen keeping the containment\nof the prompt and delayed event containment to the optimal level, as obtained from MC simulation studies. The top\nmost layer consisting of 9 PSBs are used as a trigger layer for cosmic muon events as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The time\ninterval (\u2206T ) distribution of two consecutive muons has been evaluated in the triggered layer of ISMRAN array at sea\nlevel, which is demonstrated in detail in ref [42]. Figure 7 (a) shows the Ebar in a single PSB due to the non-reactor backgrounds. A feature at \u223c 20 MeV is due to the minimum ionization energy deposition by cosmic muons in the 10 cm thick PSB. Natural radioactive background mainly dominated by the Compton edges of 40K (Ebar = 1.11 MeV) and 208Tl (Ebar = 2.21 MeV) are below 3 MeV. Depending on their energy deposition in PSB, non-reactor backgrounds has been separated into two regions, (A) natural radioactive background region (0.2 < Ebar(MeV) < 10.0) and (B) cosmic muon background region (15.0 < Ebar(MeV) < 50.0). Figure 7 (b) shows the comparison between the Ebar from data and MC simulated events for cosmic muon in a single PSB. There is a reasonable agreement between data and MC\nresults for single bar Ebar for cosmic muon events and the energy region between 15.0 MeV to 50.0 MeV can be used for triggering of the cosmic muon events in ISMRAN array.\nThe sum energy (Esum) and the number of bars hit (Nbars) variables are constructed, in each cell, for natural radioactive and cosmic muon background regions for different cells of ISMRAN array. This scheme is used for the\nestimation of the position dependent background in PSBs for the non-reactor environmental background. For this\nstudy, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), we are showing only the comparison results from the cell 3, 4 and 5 which are at the\ncenter of the ISMRAN array. Similar results are observed in other cell combinations. Esum is calculated using the PSBs which have energy deposition above 0.2 MeV. For calculation of Esum for a cell, we take only those PSBs which are assigned in the cell from Fig. 1 (b) and do the arthematic sum of the energy deposition in each PSB corresponding\nto that cell. Figure 8 (a) and (b) show the comparative study of the Esum and the Nbars distributions for natural radioactive background region among different cells, respectively. From Fig. 8 (a), it can be seen that the dominant background up to 3 MeV is from the natural radioactivity and mainly from 40K(Ebar = 1.11 MeV) and 208Tl(Ebar = 2.21 MeV ). The yield of this background in cell 4, which is the center most cell, is less as compared to other two\ncells indicating the qualitative enhanced purity for \u03bde events can be obtained in this region of the ISMRAN array. This also shows the uniformity of the energy scale across the PSBs for the reconstruction of the correlated events in\nISMRAN array. Similar feature is also observed in the Nbars distribution as shown in Fig. 8(b). Figure 9 (a) and (b) show the comparative study of Esum and Nbars distributions for cosmic muon background region, respectively. The Esum distribution shows three distinct peaks, around 20 MeV, 40 MeV and 60 MeV, which corresponds to the passage of muons in one, two and three bars in each cell, respectively. Enhanced event rate at 60 MeV compare to 20 MeV and\n40 MeV indicates that most of the high energy cosmic muons passing through the cells vertically. Atmospheric muons with an average energy of \u223c4 GeV passing through the scintillator bar covering a distance of \u223c10 cm approximately looses 20 MeV of energy in a single PSB. These high energy muons act as minimum ionizing particle with nearly\nconstant energy deposition in PSBs. Since the cell 4 is the innermost cell, covered all around by detectors, a passing\nmuon has to deposit atleast this minimum energy in two PSBs. This is not the case for other cells, where there can\nbe passing muons which can span any number of PSBs to come out of the cell. Hence there is an increase in the\nyield at 40 MeV for the center cell 4 as compared to the top cell 5 and the bottom cell 3. In this way the muon\ncontamination in the ISMRAN array can be quantified in the reactor data and the muon induced background events\ncan be circumvented for the analysis of \u03bde events. Figure 9 (b) shows the Nbars distribution for three cells and can be seen for cell 4 the number of bars fired at 2 is higher as compared to other cells.\nThe correlated background from cosmic muons is mainly dominated by the stopping muons (SM) in non-reactor\nenvironment. The selected SM arise from the muons entering through the top layers of PSBs in ISMRAN array, stopping inside the array, and eventually decaying into e\u2212 or e+ with a large energy deposition in ISMRAN array [42,"

Reconstruction of Esum and Nbars for different radioactive sources in the ISMRAN array\nIn order to understand the acceptance effect on the reconstruction of a coincident event, i.e. Compton scattered\n\u03b3-ray energy deposition in multiple bars within a 20 ns coincidence time window, in ISMRAN setup, we use \u03b3-rays + positron coming from 22Na radioactive source. The 22Na emits \u03b3-rays of energy 0.511 MeV and 1.274 MeV. Figure 10 (a) and (b) show the event distribution inside the ISMRAN array when the 22Na source is placed at the center cell\n4 and the corner cell 8, respectively. As it can be seen qualitatively, the reconstructed events are contained within\nthe vicinity of six bars from the central bar with the highest event counts in both cases. Figure 10 (c) shows the\ncomparison of the Esum distribution, in the range of 0.2 < Ebar (MeV) < 3.0 and 2 < Nbars < 5, when the source is placed at the center cell 4 and corner cell 8. The correlated high energy \u03b3-ray of 1.274 MeV and those from the annihilation of e+ from 22Na source are reasonably well reconstructed at \u223c 2 MeV and at \u223c 1.0 MeV. The overall shift in the peak positions in both the cases is small and the acceptance of the higher energy \u03b3-ray is better when the source\nis placed at the center cell 4 of ISMRAN as compared to the corner cell 8. This is due to the impartial containment\nof the higher energy \u03b3-ray in the corner cell 8. At lower energy, the yields in both the cases are similar indicating the\ncomplete acceptance and reconstruction of annihilation \u03b3-rays in the ISMRAN array. It is also important to compare\nthe response of sum energy (Esum) and number of bars hit (Nbars) distributions between data and MC simulations for optimizing the detection efficiencies using the selection criteria on these variables for the selection of prompt and\ndelayed events for the candidate \u03bde events in data. Figure 11 (a) and (b) show the comparison of reconstructed Nbars and Esum distributions in data and MC simulation for 22Na source placed at the center cell 4 of the ISMRAN array. Only those PSBs are selected for the reconstruction of Nbars and Esum where the individual energy deposition in each PSB is between 0.2 MeV to 3.0 MeV, so as to minimize the cosmic muon background. There is reasonably good\nagreement between data and MC results comparison for the Nbars and Esum distributions.\nThe Nbars by a coincident event in the full ISMRAN array is a critical variable that affects the reconstructed sum energy of different radioactive \u03b3 sources. Figure 11(a) shows the comparison of data and MC simulation of Nbars\nfor reconstructing the sum energy of 22Na source. In earlier studies using same PSBs, it is observed that the ratio of signal from coincident events using 60Co radioactive \u03b3-ray source to natural background events worsens with increase in Nbars in sum energy distribution inside a matrix of 4\u00d74 PSBs [29]. Hence, by appropriately selecting Nbars and Ebar in each PSB, the coincident events can be reconstructed based on Esum and Nbars variables for ISMRAN setup for coincident \u03b3-rays generated in the decay of radioactive sources. As it can be seen from Fig 11(b), a peak at \u223c1.78 MeV corresponds to the coincident of \u03b3-ray and positron events from 22Na source and a feature at \u223c1.2 MeV corresponds to the \u03b3-ray of energy 1.274 MeV originating from 22Na source [21] in Esum distribution, which has been reconstructed in the range of 2 < Nbars < 5. This method will be periodically tested in the real experiment at reactor hall while performing the in-situ calibrations using radioactive \u03b3-ray sources for the uniformity of response in the\nPSBs.\nTo have a good understanding of the \u03bde interaction, it is necessary to reconstruct the neutron capture event on Gd or H nuclei. The Esum and Nbars hit variables have been reconstructed for n-H and n-Gd capture events using Am/Be neutron source. The Am/Be neutron source is placed on top of the ISMRAN array, since it was not possible to put the\nsource at the center of the array due to the space constraints. Figure 12 (a) shows the comparison of Esum obtained from Am/Be neutron source and natural radioactive background. The Esum is reconstructed using the individual PSBs satisfying the energy selection criteria between 0.2 MeV to 8.0 MeV and 2 < Nbars < 5. A peak at \u223c 2.1 MeV corresponds to the neutron capture on hydrogen and at \u223c 4.2 MeV corresponds to the 4.4 MeV high energy \u03b3-ray originating from Am/Be source. Figure 12 (b) shows the comparison of Nbars between Am/Be neutron source and natural background. These selection criteria are made to compare the Esum and Nbars variables between n-H capture events and natural background events. In both variables, n-H capture events are distinctively observed from the natural\nbackground. The selection of slightly different Nbars cut for the n-H events from Am/Be source is to emphasis the\nability of reconstruction of the mono-energetic \u03b3-ray from n-H capture event in the presence of the underlying natural background events. For 22Na source, the underlying background events from the natural radioactivity are almost\nnegligible and hence do not interfere in the sum energy spectra. Figure 13 (a), (b) and (c) show the comparison\nbetween data and MC simulation for individual Ebar, Esum and Nbars from the cascade \u03b3-rays from n-Gd capture events using an Am/Be neutron source, respectively. Only those PSBs are selected for the Esum where the individual energy deposition in each PSB is between 0.2 MeV to 8.0 MeV. For the complete capture and reconstruction of cascade \u03b3-rays, with Esum \u223c 8 MeV, in the ISMRAN array, the Esum is required to be in the range of 2.6 MeV to 10.0 MeV and Nbars should be in the range of 9 to 14. This selection criteria is implemented to reduce the contamination from the natural radioactive and cosmogenic muon background in the Esum. The cascade \u03b3-rays from the n-Gd neutron capture events were implemented using the DICEBOX packages in GEANT4 separately and then propagated for the\nrecording of the energy deposition in each PSB. The energy resolution function is incorporated, for the deposited\nenergy in each PSB, in the MC simulated events. A good agreement between data and MC simulation has been\nobserved in the individual cascade \u03b3-ray distribution, as shown in Fig 13 (a), for n-Gd capture events. Figure 13\n(b) shows the comparison of the reconstructed Esum from cascade \u03b3-rays between data and MC simulated events. A clear peak at \u223c 7.7 MeV is observed in data and is in reasonable agreement with that obtained from MC simulated events. This again shows the uniformity and linearity in the energy response across the PSBs in ISMRAN detector.\nFigure 13 (c) shows the comparison of the reconstructed Nbars distribution between data with MC simulated events for the cascade \u03b3-rays from n-Gd capture events. Again, a reasonably good agreement between data and MC simulated\nevents is observed and a selection criteria on Nbars can filter out the complete containment of the cascade \u03b3-ray event from n-Gd capture in the ISMRAN array. Additional criteria for selecting the cascade \u03b3-rays of n-Gd capture events\nfrom natural background, we sort the hit bars in each reconstructed event, according to the decreasing order of their\nindividual energy depositions in PSBs. The PSB which has maximum energy deposition, is denoted as Emax, out of all the bars used for the reconstruction of the candidate events. Similarly E1 correspond to the bar which is next, in terms of energy deposition with respect to the Emax, for the reconstruction of the candidate event. Figure 14 (a) and (b) show the comparison of reconstructed Emax and E1 distributions in data compared with MC simulation for the Esum in the range of 2.6 MeV to 10.0 MeV and the Nbars within the range of 9 to 14. A reasonable agreement between data and MC simulated events for the Emax and E1 distributions are observed with average \u03c72 is 0.239. More differential comparison of the energy profiles in PSB is done using the ratio of E1/Emax and Emax/Esum for the n-Gd capture events. Figure 15 (a) and (b) show the comparison of reconstructed E1/Emax and Emax/Esum distributions in data compared with MC simulated events for cascade \u03b3-rays from n-Gd capture events. A reasonable agreement between data and MC simulated events for the E1/Emax and Emax/Esum distributions are observed with average \u03c72 is 0.179. Applying selection criteria on the E1/Emax and Emax/Esum ratios will improve the rejection of fast neutron or\naccidental background from \u03bde delayed events [37]. A detailed study of the peak positions and the resolution of the peaks using reconstructed Esum obtained from different radioactive and neutron source are tabulated in table 2. A very good agreement is observed between the reconstructed Esum from data and MC simulated events."

            "text": "cosmogenic and natural radioactive backgrounds. ISMRAN deals with an active FN background inside the reactor hall, predominantly generated by the spontaneous fission of the (238U) and (234Th) decay chains from reactor fuel and\n(\u03b1, n) reactions in surrounding material inside the reactor hall. FNs are also produced by cosmic muons in the inactive\n(shielding) regions surrounding the detector [45]. Their large interaction length allows them to cross the detector,\nget thermalized and then get captured inside the ISMRAN array, causing both a prompt-like event triggered by recoil\nprotons and a delayed-like event triggered by capture on Gd or H nuclei, which mimics exact signature of a prompt\nand a delayed pair from IBD process as shown in Fig. 16. Reactor related fast neutrons typically have energies of few\nMeV and neutrons of much higher energies (up to a few GeV) are produced from cosmogenic neutrons and cosmic\nmuon-induced spallation reactions. Therefore, a good understanding of fast neutron response in PSBs is an essential\npre-requisite for suppression and discrimination of fast neutron background from IBD events [46]. Fast neutron energy\nresponse has been measured in PSB, using time-of-flight (TOF) technique, for neutrons of energy between 1 MeV to 8 MeV originating from an Am/Be source. Fast neutrons are produced via 9Be(\u03b1, n)12C reactions, where the \u03b1 particle is produced in radioactive decays of 241Am. In about \u223c60% of the cases, the carbon nucleus is produced in an excited state, and emits a \u223c 4.44 MeV \u03b3-ray in addition to the neutron. To get background-free fast neutron events, the 4.44 MeV \u03b3-ray is used as a tag for the delayed coincidence measurement of the fast neutrons using TOF technique. We used a 2\u2032\u2032 cerium bromide (CeBr3) detector for triggering 4.44 MeV \u03b3-ray, which provides the reference start time for the corresponding emitted neutrons. The CeBr3 detector is placed very close to the Am/Be source. The ISMRAN array is positioned at \u223c1.1 m away from the Am/Be source at the source height, as shown in Fig. 16. As a trigger for the start time, 4.44 MeV \u03b3-ray has been tagged in CeBr3 detector and neutron or \u03b3-ray as stopped time candidate is recorded at the first column (10 PSBs) of ISMRAN array. The time coincidence window between start and stop\ndetector is chosen to be 110 ns. The schematic representation of the entire setup for this technique is shown in Fig. 16.\nBy recording the start and stop time signals from CeBr3 and first column of ISMRAN array, the TOF is reconstructed for discrimination between the \u03b3-rays and neutrons on the first column of the ISMRAN array. The time difference\nbetween the neutron on the first column and the CeBr3 detector, a neutron time-of-flight (TOF) is constructed and the kinetic energy of the fast neutrons are determined. One of the most important variable in identifying \u03bde candidate events is the time difference between prompt and delayed events inside the ISMRAN array. From MC simulations, the average time difference between prompt and delayed event is observed to be \u223c 68 \u00b5s with a range extending up to 250 \u00b5s [29]. Using these tagged fast neutrons in first column of the ISMRAN array and subsequently using them\nas triggers, the neutron capture time can be measured in the rest of the ISMRAN array. Figure 17 (a) shows the\ncomparison of energy deposition of the \u03b3-rays from an Am/Be neutron source and the natural background in CeBr3 detector. The CeBr3 detector is calibrated using standard radioactive \u03b3-ray sources and the energy resolution obtained at 0.662 MeV is 3.8%. An energy threshold is applied at around 2 MeV to exclude very low energy \u03b3-ray events,\nto avoid the accidental random correlations. The features in the \u03b3-ray distribution from Am/Be between 3 MeV to 5 MeV correspond to neutron-associated \u03b3-rays from the de-excitation of 12C\u2217. As it can be seen from Fig 17(a), a full-energy peak at \u223c4.44 MeV corresponds to high energy \u03b3-ray due to the de-excitation of carbon nucleus from Am/Be neutron source and while the corresponding first and second escape peaks appear at \u223c3.93 MeV and \u223c3.5 MeV, respectively. The natural \u03b3-ray background is scaled by a factor of 10 for the representation purposes and is\nnegligible in the current measurements. Figure 17 (b) shows the TOF distribution of fast neutrons as a function of\n\u03b3-ray energy deposition in CeBr3 detector within the time coincidence window of 110 ns. Two distinct bands at \u223c1.0 ns and \u223c 38 ns in the TOF distribution are due to \u03b3-rays and neutron, respectively. The separation between \u03b3-rays and neutrons is excellent and this feature is used to tag the fast neutrons on the first column of the ISMRAN array.\nFigure 18 (a) shows the projection of TOF distribution for \u03b3-rays and fast neutrons by tagging high energy \u03b3-rays between 3.0 MeV to 5.0 MeV in CeBr3 detector. A peak at \u223c 1.0 ns correspond to the \u03b3-rays, having width of \u223c4.5 ns. T0, the instant of emission of the neutron from the source, is determined from the location of this peak in the TOF spectra using the speed of light (c) and the measurement of the distances (L) between the PSBs and the neutron source.\nThe \u03b3-rays and the fast-neutron are clearly identified and separated in the TOF distribution. The tagged neutron peak is around \u223c 38 ns and ranges between 25 ns to 100 ns. Events above TOF > 100 ns are mainly due to the random coincidences. The kinetic energy distribution of the neutrons can be determined by measured TOF using the following\nclassical expression of neutron kinetic energy,\nEn = 1 2 mV2 = 1 2\nm ( L2\nt2\n) = \u03b12 ( L2\nt2\n) ; where,\u03b1 = 72.3( \u221a ev).\u00b5s/m, (6)\nTOFn = 72.3L \u221a\nEn ; TOF\u03b3 = (L c ) . (7)\nFigure 18 (b) shows the neutron kinetic energy distribution, derived from the TOF spectrum of tagged neutron between\n25 ns and 100 ns. The neutron kinetic energy distribution shows peaks at 3.2 MeV, 4.8 MeV and 6.0 MeV, which is\nin good agreement with Lorch data [47] between 2.5 MeV and 8 MeV. Figure 19 (a) shows the energy deposition (Epdep) of the recoiling proton by fast neutrons, in MeVee, in PSB as a function of kinetic energy of neutron derived from TOF. To minimize the contributions from the accidental natural background, \u03b3-ray energy selection between 3.0\nMeV and 5.0 MeV is made which covers the first escape, second escape and photoelectric peak for 4.44 MeV \u03b3-ray\nfrom Am/Be source. For reducing the uncertainties while deriving the kinetic energy of the neutrons, we select the z-position of the stopped events within \u00b1 10 cm around the center of the PSBs. The projection of the Epdep of the neutron in PSB for different neutron kinetic energy bins is shown in Fig 19 (b). The width of the projected Epdep distribution increases with increasing kinetic energy of the neutron. This is due to the fact that exact binning in the\nTOF distribution for deriving kinetic energy is not possible and the smearing effect on kinetic energy is observed more\nprominently towards smaller TOF values which yields larger neutron kinetic energies. To reduce this smearing effect, the projection of Epdep by the fast neutrons in PSBs are plotted in bins of 1 MeV for the derived kinetic energy of the fast neutrons. Also for fast neutrons with higher energies, the multiple scattering within PSBs can be characterized by\nbroader signal pulses because of their successive convolution of individual pulses separated in time. The peak values of the projected distribution of Epdep by the fast neutrons through recoiling proton are used for the parametrization of the deposited energy as a function of neutron kinetic energy in PSBs. This parametrization would help in determining the fast neutron energy scale from reactor background in the ISMRAN array. Figure 20 shows the mean of the Epdep, obtained from Fig 19 (b), of the fast neutrons in PSB as a function of kinetic energy of neutrons. To obtain a relation between the Epdep by the recoiling protons from fast neutrons in PSB, a parametrization between kinetic energy of neutron and Epdep from recoiling proton in PSB is obtained using the empirical formula as shown in Eqs. 8\nEpdep = a0En \u2212 a1(1 \u2212 e \u2212a2E a3 n ) (8)\nwhere, Epdep is the electron energy equivalent of deposited energy due to proton recoil and En is the kinetic energy of\nfast neutron. The parameters a0, a1, a2, and a3 are represent the light response function for fast neutron in PSB [48].\nThe measurement of the characteristic time difference of the neutron thermalization and capture on Gd nucleus\nis one of the most important variables used in the discrimination of \u03bde candidate events. With these tagged neutrons\nobtained from TOF technique at the first column of the ISMRAN array, we demonstrated a novel technique to measure\nthe characteristic capture time of these neutrons on Gd nucleus. We use the tagged fast neutrons identified in the first\ncolumn of ISMRAN array using TOF technique, treating them as prompt events, and then searching for the n-Gd\ncapture event as a delayed candidate events in rest of the ISMRAN array within a coincidence time window of 1000\n\u00b5s. Only those PSBs are selected for the Esum of delayed candidate events where the individual Ebar in each PSB is between 0.25 MeV to 10.0 MeV. For delayed event candidate, the Esum, is required to be in the range of 2.6 MeV to 10.0 MeV and Nbars should be in the range of 4 to 14. Figure 21 (a) shows the time difference \u2206T distribution between the start event time from the tagged neutrons and \u03b3-ray events in the first column of the ISMRAN array and\nthe stopped event time measured in the rest of the ISMRAN array. The \u2206T distribution for the neutron tagged events,\nshown in black solid points, shows a exponential behaviour which is the characteristic nature of the n-Gd capture\nData Data\nevents in ISMRAN array. One the other hand, the \u2206T distribution for \u03b3-ray tagged events, shown in red squares,\nshows a uniform distribution in \u2206T indicating the randomness in the prompt-delayed event pairs. Figure 21 (b) shows\nthe characteristic time \u03c4 obtained from the a fit with a exponential and a constant term. The exponential part represent\nthe neutron capture time on Gd and a constant term, B, shows the accidental background. The \u03c4 obtained from the fit to the neutron tagged events from data is 68.29 \u00b1 9.48 \u00b5s and is in good agreement with 64.88 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5s that obtained from MC simulation events as shown in Fig. 21 (c). This way we have demonstrated a novel technique for\nthe determination of the neutron capture time on Gd in ISMRAN array inspired by the data driven method."
