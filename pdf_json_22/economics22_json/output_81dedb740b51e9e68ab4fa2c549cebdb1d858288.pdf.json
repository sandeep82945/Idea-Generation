    "abstractText": "Banning the Box\u201d refers to a policy campaign aimed at prohibiting employers from soliciting applicant information that could be used to statistically discriminate against categories of applicants (in particular, those with criminal records). In this article, we examine how the concealing or revealing of informative features about an applicant\u2019s identity affects hiring both directly and, in equilibrium, by possibly changing applicants\u2019 incentives to invest in human capital. We show that there exist situations in which an employer and an applicant are in agreement about whether to ban the box. Specifically, depending on the structure of the labor market, banning the box can be (1) Pareto dominant, (2) Pareto dominated, (3) benefit the applicant while harming the employer, or (4) benefit the employer while harming the applicant. Our results have policy implications spanning beyond employment decisions, including the use of credit checks by landlords and standardized tests in college admissions.

Eliminating it is a longstanding and vexing policy challenge. While the term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d itself has a wide array of closely related definitions, in this article we say that discrimination occurs whenever a decision-maker treats one group of applicants differently than another group, simply as a function of their group memberships (i.e., holding all other factors equal).\nDiscrimination can arise from various sources, including a \u201ctaste\u201d for one group over another (e.g., Becker (1971)), belief-based \u201cstatistical\u201d discrimination (e.g., Phelps (1972), Arrow (1973)), and implicit biases in evaluating/choosing individuals (e.g., Bertrand, Chugh and Mullainathan (2005)). A feature common to all three of these sources of discrimination is that the employer must be able to observe (or infer) applicants\u2019 group memberships.1 Accordingly, eliminating or withholding this information may help forestall discrimination at its root source.2\nThis article examines the theoretical impact of withholding potentially sensitive information that an employer might use to discriminate between applicants. A central con-\n1We use hiring as our running example in this article, but the implications are more general in scope. 2A related issue (that for reasons of space we do not confront as squarely as we could in this article) is the degree to which employers can, or should, infer sensitive information about applicants from seemingly innocuous co-variates. Our theory does indicate the importance of this question to the degree that it clearly, if partially, illustrates the situations in which such an incentive would emerge in equilibrium.\nclusion of our analysis is that withholding such information can have ambiguous welfare effects. In many cases, the information has no impact on welfare whatsoever, but withholding the information can (1) hurt employers while helping workers, (2) hurt workers while helping employers, (3) hurt both employers and workers, or (4) help both employers and workers.\nOur model of the labor market is very stylized, largely focusing only one dimension of the employment market (specifically, moral hazard). However, this simplicity implies that the theory indicates some reasons why the policy debate surrounding how to reduce discrimination is best not simply thought of as a zero-sum struggle between labor and management."

We build on this body of work by considering how eliminating the information required for direct discrimination affects incentives on both sides of the market, employment outcomes, and overall welfare. Specifically, we consider how hiding applicants\u2019 group memberships from potential employers will affect the employers\u2019 willingnesses to hire, which will then in turn determine\nthe applicants\u2019 incentives to invest in becoming qualified for the job in question.3"

            "text": "Discrimination comes in a variety of forms (e.g., National Research Council (2004)). A classic division of these is between direct and indirect forms of discrimination. Direct discrimination occurs when the hiring decision is conditioned upon an applicant\u2019s group membership. Indirect discrimination occurs when the hiring process produces different outcomes for different groups. Obviously, removing information about an applicant\u2019s\n3Eguia (2017) and Kim and Loury (2019) consider related models in which group membership may be endogenously determined. 4For a comprehensive review of the theoretical and empirical literatures about BTB, see Raphael (2020). 5The point at which such consideration is permissible varies across jurisdictions. It is common for the prohibition to extend until a conditional offer of employment is made. A full consideration of the effect of this timing is very interesting. However, space precludes us from treatment of this issue in this article.\ncriminal record removes the simplest route for direct discrimination.6 However, removing the information may induce the employer to not hire any applicants. When this occurs in our model,7 this behavior represents belief-based statistical discrimination because there is no equilibrium in which the employer can hold accurate beliefs that justify hiring any applicant without knowing the applicant\u2019s group membership.\nThere is empirical evidence of statistical discrimination occurring when the box is banned (e.g., Doleac and Hansen (2020)). However, the answer to the central policy question \u2014 namely whether the negative effect of statistical discrimination on all workers under BTB outweighs the positive effect of eliminating disparate treatment of members of the disadvantaged group \u2014 depends on several parameters, including \u201cthe extent to which those with criminal histories benefit from suppressing information, the extent to which those without criminal histories are harmed, and the relative size of these two classes of applicants within the group itself\u201d (Raphael (2020), p.7).\nIt is important to note that, though BTB is frequently discussed regarding consideration of criminal history in the hiring process, the logic identified by our model regarding the ambiguity of BTB\u2019s effects on both employment and welfare extends to the effects of\n6In our model, it removes the only route for direct discrimination. We say that it removes the \u201csimplest\u201d route because, in reality, it is possible that the employer could obtain this information through means beyond the scope of our model. 7Specifically, when the parameters of the model are such that this \u201cmarket failure\u201d occurs in equilibrium without group membership information but there is a positive rate of employment in equilibrium when information about group membership is available.\nincluding/excluding other types of information, including information about credit history (e.g., Bartik and Nelson (2019), Maturana, Nickerson and Truffa (2020)) in both hiring and other decision-making processes, such as housing."

            "heading": "3 Our Model",
            "text": "The existing literature on discrimination tends to focus on either taste-based discrimination (e.g., Becker (1971)), in which an employer prefers workers from one group over another, or statistical discrimination (e.g., Phelps (1972)), in which an employer holds different beliefs about a worker\u2019s unobserved characteristics based on the worker\u2019s group membership. As displayed in Table 1, our theory pursues the latter path, asking the question of how removing the information required for \u201cdirect\u201d discrimination (for example, explicitly and knowingly hiring one group at a lower rate than another) can affect investment, employment, and welfare through its potential to incentivize \u201cindirect\u201d statistical discrimination in equilibrium. To keep our analysis as compact as possible without distorting the underlying analysis, we rule out wage discrimination and focus solely on employment discrimination in terms of differential standards for employment at a prevailing, common market wage.8\nIn our theory, workers have correct expectations about employers\u2019 approach to hiring when deciding whether to become qualified or not, as in Coate and Loury (1993). The\n8We discuss relaxing the assumption that the employer is a wage taker in Section 9.\ntwo groups of workers are distinguished solely by the probabilities that the members of the two groups have an opportunity to become qualified at all. We refer to this probability as the group in question\u2019s potential. One of the immediate conclusions within our framework is that BTB can have an effect on outcomes only if the groups differ in terms of their potentials and/or the ability for the employer to detect a group members\u2019 true qualification.9 Because we assume that the employer has equally accurate information about the skills acquired by individuals in both groups, our theory indicates that banning the box can help eliminate discrimination in practice only to the degree that the groups have different likelihoods of having the opportunity to acquire the skills desired by employers.10\nWe consider a simple situation in which there are two groups, differing in their poten9 As we discuss later (footnote 12), our analysis assumes that the presence or the absence of the box has an effect on outcomes simply by serving as \u201can equiibrium selection mechanism.\u201d 10This distinguishes our analysis from that of Coate and Loury (1993), who assume that the groups have identical potentials. In addition, our results also provide another justification for the assumption in Coate and Loury\u2019s analysis that the employer observes each applicant\u2019s group membership.\ntials. We refer to the group with higher potential as the advantaged group and the other group as disadvantaged. In terms of the application to BTB, our analysis and presentation supposes that \u2014 holding all else constant \u2014 an individual who has been convicted of a felony has had a lower probability of having the opportunity to acquire job-relevant skills prior to applying for employment than an otherwise similar applicant who has not been convicted of a felony.\nRemark 1 For simplicity, our theory considers only two groups of workers. In the context of BTB, we personally think of these two groups as \u201cconvicted felons\u201d and \u201call other people,\u201d but the debate about BTB is in a sense really about a setting with multiple, overlapping groups (e.g., individuals have both racial group membership(s) and felon/non-felon status). Specifically, much of the debate in the US is about how omitting information about felon status will differentially affect workers of color relative to white workers. Interpreting our theory\u2019s conclusions in the context of this much richer debate requires one to \u201cstep back\u201d from the model in a sense and, for example, consider the analysis in parallel\u2014one set of parameters for (say) white workers and another set of parameters for workers of color. Placing these parallel analyses side-by-side will then allow one to consider the impact of BTB on the outcomes experienced by workers from different racial groups as a function of whether information about the second, \u201cfelon status\u201d group membership is included in the hiring process.\nAgain following Coate and Loury (1993), we model the dilemma facing employers and workers as a moral hazard problem: any given worker\u2019s investment in qualifica-\ntion is imperfectly observed by the employer. As mentioned above, we assume that the precision of the employer\u2019s noisy signal about any given worker\u2019s true qualification is independent of the worker\u2019s group membership. In this setting, our theory identifies the induced preferences regarding BTB for each of the three types of actors (i.e., employers, and workers in each of the two groups). A few of the more notable results from the baseline model are as follows.\n1. BTB makes employers better off only if the box\u2019s presence induces workers in one\nor more groups to choose to not become qualified in some situations in which they would choose to become qualified if the box were absent.\n2. BTB can affect outcomes only\n(a) when the employer believes that the two groups have substantively different\npotentials (Corollary 1),\n(b) when the employer is able to infer differences in qualifications with sufficient\nprecision (Corollary 2).\n3. When the employer\u2019s information about qualifications is very precise, BTB\n(a) helps disadvantaged workers (if the population at large has high potential), or\n(b) hurts disadvantaged workers (if the population at large has low potential), but\n(c) always hurts the employer (Corollary 3).\n4. Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly,\n(a) BTB can help employers while hurting workers (Proposition 2), and\n(b) BTB can Pareto dominate the box (Proposition 3).\nWith the basic outline of our theory\u2019s key results in hand, we now turn to a brief discussion of some related models of discrimination in political economy."

            "text": "Becker (1971) presented the seminal analysis of the economics of taste-based discrimination. Phelps (1972) and Arrow (1973) presented early models of statistical discrimination, including how such discrimination can be self-enforcing. Coate and Loury (1993) extended this line of inquiry to consider how discrimination affects the incentive to invest in human capital and, relatedly, whether affirmative action policies might break this selfenforcing nature. Moro and Norman (2004) combine the Arrow (1973) and Coate and Loury (1993) models within a task-assignment context. Fryer Jr (2007) considers the interaction of discrimination at the hiring stage and in subsequent promotion decisions. Bjerk (2008) extends the study of dynamic, statistical discrimination by considering how differences in an employer\u2019s informational precision early in an applicant\u2019s career might affect the promotion path.\nOf these, the model developed by Coate and Loury (1993) is the most closely related to ours,11 so it is useful to consider the distinction between our model and theirs. In\n11Indeed, it was part of the inspiration for this research.\nCoate and Loury\u2019s model, the two groups of applicants are identical from an ex ante perspective. In our model, the two groups are different in the sense that one group is more likely to \u201cbe able to afford to become qualified\u201d than the other. It is important to note that this assumption is conservative relative to theirs in the sense that it offers an initial justification for the employer including \u201cthe box\u201d to distinguish between the two groups. This is \u201cconservative\u201d because our main conclusion is that there will still exist situations in which the employer strictly benefits from banning the box.\nIn Coate and Loury\u2019s model (as in Arrow\u2019s), discrimination can emerge in equilibrium in spite of the fact that the groups are identical in ex ante terms. Discrimination in such settings results from equilibrium multiplicity in the labor market and occurs when each applicant\u2019s group membership essentially serves as an equilibrium selection device. Accordingly, within their setting, the impact of banning the box would depend upon which equilibrium would be played in the absence of the box. As in Coate and Loury\u2019s model, our model typically has multiple equilibria. However, our arguments do not leverage this multiplicity: we focus throughout only on the (generically unique) Pareto efficient equilibrium. Accordingly, our comparison of labor markets with and without the box presumes that the box plays no role in equilibrium selection.12\n12 This equilibrium selection issue (alluded to in fn. 9, above), and how it connects a few seemingly\ndisparate models of statistical discrimination, are each also addressed briefly in Patty and Penn (2021)."

            "text": "Our theory is based on a two player game involving a worker, W , and an employer, E. In order to better illustrate the incentives of this baseline model, we consider first a setting with only one group of workers.\nThe Worker\u2019s Information & Potential. The worker has a (privately observed) binary real-valued type, c \u2208 C \u2261 {cL, cH}, with 0 < cL < cH . The type determines the cost of becoming qualified (q = 1) relative to remaining unqualified (q = 0) and is distributed as follows:\nPr[c = cL] = p, Pr[c = cH] = 1 \u2212 p.\nAs mentioned above in the introduction, we refer to the parameter p as the potential of the worker\u2019s group. This is because, in the cases of interest in our analysis (Assumption 1, below), p is the maximum ex ante probability that a worker in that group might actually be qualified in equilibrium.\nThe Worker\u2019s Choices. The worker first observes his or her cost of qualification, c \u2208 {cL, cH} (with 0 < cL < cH), and then chooses whether to become qualified (denoted by q = 1) or not (denoted by q = 0). If the worker chooses to become qualified, he or she incurs a net cost of c.\nThe Employer\u2019s Information. The worker\u2019s qualification (i.e., W \u2019s choice of q) is not directly observed by the employer. Rather, an informative \u2014 but noisy \u2014 signal of his or her choice, denoted by \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 \u2261 {1,2,3}, is generated as follows: q = 0 q = 1\nPr[\u03b8 = 1 \u2223 q] \u03c60 0 Pr[\u03b8 = 2 \u2223 q] 1 \u2212 \u03c60 1 \u2212 \u03c61 Pr[\u03b8 = 3 \u2223 q] 0 \u03c61\n(1)\nNote that if E observes either \u03b8 = 1 or \u03b8 = 3, then the test result reveals the qualification of the worker, q, with certainty. On the other hand, a test result of \u03b8 = 2 is a \u201cgarbled test result\u201d that can potentially be sent by both qualified and unqualified types. Accordingly, for each qualification choice, q \u2208 {0,1}, \u03c6q \u2208 (0,1) is the conditional probability that \u03b8 is \u201ccorrect\u201d in the sense of revealing q. We refer to the conditional distribution of \u03b8 described in (1) as a test of qualification, so that \u03b8 represents the outcome of the worker\u2019s test.\nThe Employer\u2019s Choices. After (1) the worker\u2019s cost of qualification, c, is realized by the worker, (2) the worker chooses his or her qualification, q, and (3) conditional on W \u2019s choice of q, the test result \u03b8 is realized and observed by the employer, the employer then finally chooses whether to hire W (denoted by h = 1) or not (denoted by h = 0).\nSequence of Play. Summarizing the description above, our model\u2019s decision sequence is as follows:\n1. The worker observes c,\n2. The worker chooses q \u2208 {0,1},\n3. The employer observes \u03b8,\n4. The employer chooses h \u2208 {0,1},\n5. The process concludes and players receive their payoffs.\nPayoffs. The players\u2019 payoffs, given c, q, and h, are as follows:\nuW (q, h \u2223 c) = wh \u2212 cq, uE(h \u2223 q, \u03b8) = (Bq \u2212w)h,\n(2)\nwhere w > 0 and B > w are exogenous parameters that are assumed to be common knowledge throughout. The parameter w represents the wage paid by E to W if E hires W , and B > w represents E\u2019s benefit from hiring (h = 1) a qualified worker (q = 1). Finally, as noted earlier, c \u2208 {cL, cH} captures W \u2019s cost of obtaining qualification.\nStrategies. A (possibly mixed) qualification strategy for W is a mapping \u03c7 \u2236 C \u2192 [0,1], where \u03c7(c) \u2261 Pr[q = 1 \u2223 c] denotes the probability that the worker chooses q = 1, given his or her cost, c. Similarly, a (possibly mixed) hiring strategy for the employer is a mapping \u03b7 \u2236 \u0398 \u2192 [0,1], where \u03b7(\u03b8) \u2261 Pr[h = 1 \u2223 \u03b8] denotes the probability E hires W , for each \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398. We refer to the employer\u2019s hiring strategy, \u03b7, as aggressive when \u03b7(2) = 1, conservative when \u03b7(2) = 0, and mixed when \u03b7(2) \u2208 (0,1).\nBeliefs. The employer\u2019s beliefs about q, given \u03b8, are denoted by \u00b5(\u03b8) \u2261 Pr[q = 1 \u2223 \u03b8]. Our equilibrium concept of choice, sequential equilibrium, will require that these beliefs be correct. We now turn to the analysis of the model."

Sequential equilibria are typically more complicated to verify than perfect Bayesian equilibria, but have the benefit of ruling out some perfect Bayesian equilibria in which E holds \u201cunreasonable off the path beliefs.\u201d In our setting, this refinement is particularly useful because it rules out an otherwise ubiquitous perfect Bayesian \u201cpooling\u201d equilibrium in which the employer never hires workers (even after observing \u03b8 = 3) and workers never become qualified. This is not a sequential equilibrium: in any sequential equilibrium, E\u2019s beliefs about q must satisfy the following:13\n\u00b5(3) = 1. 13To see this, consider any sequence of \u201cfully mixed\u201d strategies by the worker, {\u03c7\u03c4} \u221e \u03c4=1 with \u03c7\u03c4(c) \u2208 (0,1)\nfor both c \u2208 {cL, cH}, and consider the sequence of beliefs, {\u00b5 \u2217 \u03c4} \u221e \u03c4=1 such that \u00b5 \u2217 \u03c4 is consistent with \u03c7\u03c4 and Bayes\u2019s rule for each \u03c4 \u2208 {1,2, . . . ,}.

The sequentially rational hiring strategy for E, given \u00b5, is essentially defined by the following:\n\u03b7(\u03b8 \u2223 \u00b5) = \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 0 if \u03b8 = 1, 0 if \u03b8 = 2 and \u00b5 < w B , 1 if \u03b8 = 2 and \u00b5 > w B , 1 if \u03b8 = 3,\n(4)\nand any hiring probability is sequentially rational conditional upon \u03b8 = 2 and \u00b5 = w B . With this in hand, we will write E\u2019s strategy simply as \u03b7 \u2261 Pr[h = 1 \u2223 \u03b8 = 2].\nEquilibrium Qualification. Turning to the worker, first note that if w < cL, then q = 1 is strictly dominated for W , so that \u03c7(cL) = 0 and \u03b7 = 0 in any equilibrium. On the other hand, when cH < w, there may exist equilibria in which all workers obtain qualification with probability 1 (i.e., \u03c7(cL) = \u03c7(cH) = 1). While these equilibria are interesting in their own right, they do not accurately reflect the role we intend for the parameter p to play in\n14The structure of the payoffs in (2), along with the assumption that \u03c60 > 0, imply that Pr[\u03b8 = 1] > 0 in any Bayes Nash equilibrium of this model, so that Bayes\u2019s rule implies that \u00b5(1) = 0 in any Bayes Nash equilibrium.\nthe model \u2014 an upper bound on the probability that q = 1 (i.e., the maximum \u201cequilibrium potential\u201d of the worker\u2019s group). Accordingly, we assume throughout that cL < w < cH , so that q = 1 is strictly dominated if c = cH but not strictly dominated when c = cL (this does not imply that q = 1 is a best response for the worker when c = cL).\nAssumption 1 Qualification is strictly dominated for W conditional on c = cH and costly, but not strictly dominated, conditional on c = cL:\n0 < cL < w < cH .\nWith Assumption 1 in hand, we simplify notation and write W \u2019s strategy simply as \u03c7 \u2261 Pr[q = 1 \u2223 c = cL] (i.e., \u03c7(cH) = 0 in all equilibria). We begin with E\u2019s sequentially rational hiring decision conditional on \u03c7 and \u03b8 = 2. E is willing to hire (i.e. to set \u03b7 > 0) only if\n(1 \u2212 \u03c61)p\u03c7(1 \u2212 \u03c61)p\u03c7 + (1 \u2212 \u03c60)(1 \u2212 p + p(1 \u2212 \u03c7)) \u2265 w B .

(6)\nEquations 5 and 6 give us two cases to consider, distinguished by the employer\u2019s sequen-\ntially rational decision conditional on \u03b8 = 2 when E believes \u03c7 = 1. If\n(1 \u2212 \u03c61)p(1 \u2212 \u03c61)p + (1 \u2212 \u03c60)(1 \u2212 p) \u2265 w B , (7)\nthen E is willing to hire upon observing \u03b8 = 2 if he or she believes that \u03c7 = 1. Accordingly, in this case there exists an equilibrium with \u03c7 = 1 if and only if\nw \u2265 cL\n\u03c60 . (8)\nOn the other hand, if\n(1 \u2212 \u03c61)p(1 \u2212 \u03c61)p + (1 \u2212 \u03c60)(1 \u2212 p) < w B ,\nthen E is unwilling to hire conditional on \u03b8 = 2 regardless of \u03c7. In this case there exists an equilibrium with \u03c7 = 1 if and only if w is sufficiently high and/or \u03b8 = 3 is sufficiently likely, conditional on q = 1:\nw \u2265 cL\n\u03c61 . (9)\nFinally, it may be the case that the Pareto efficient equilibrium is a mixed strategy equilibrium, with W using a non-degenerate mixed strategy conditional upon c = cL, and E using a non-degenerate mixed strategy conditional upon \u03b8 = 2. In this case Equations 5 and 6 must hold with equality, implying\n1. The test is more accurate conditional on being qualified than not: \u03c60 < \u03c61,\n2. The wage is sufficiently high to sustain positive qualification: w \u2265 cL \u03c61 , and\n3. The players\u2019 equilibrium strategies are described by the following:\n\u03b7M \u2261 \u03b7M(w,\u03c6, cL) = w\u03c61 \u2212 cL w(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60) , (10)\n\u03c7M(p) \u2261 \u03c7M(p,B,w,\u03c6, cL) = w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) p(B(1 \u2212 \u03c61) +w(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60)) . (11)\nWe now define the employer\u2019s hiring threshold, denoted by p\u2217E , as the probability of qualification that makes E indifferent about hiring W after observing a garbled test result (\u03b8 = 2) conditional on W becoming qualified if and only if W \u2019s cost of qualification is c = cL (i.e., \u03c7 = 1):15\np\u2217E \u2261 w(1 \u2212 \u03c60)\nB(1 \u2212 \u03c61) +w(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60) . (12) Putting Equations (5), (10), & (11) together, we can characterize six equilibrium regions, depending on w, \u03c60, \u03c61, and cL. In order to better characterize these regions, we first describe the types of equilibria that can emerge in our framework.\nTypes of Equilibria. In terms of the worker\u2019s strategy, \u03c7, our model admits three qualitative types of equilibria:\n\u2022 In a full qualification equilibrium (FQE), all low-cost workers get qualified: \u03c7 = 1.\n\u2022 In a zero qualification equilibrium (ZQE), no workers get qualified: \u03c7 = 0.\n\u2022 In a mixed strategy equilibrium (MSE), some low-cost workers get qualified and\nsome don\u2019t: \u03c7 \u2208 (0,1).16 15Note that term p\u2217E defined in (12) is simply a rearrangement of Equation (5). 16Note that the full qualification equilibrium and zero qualification equilibria, when they exist, are oth-\nWith the three classes of equilibria in hand, the following proposition characterizes all equilibria. It also demonstrates that, when multiple equilibria exist, the worker and employer share the same preferences over these equilibria.\nProposition 1 Table 2 characterizes all equilibria of the model. When multiple equilibria exist, they are strictly Pareto ranked as follows: the FQE dominates the MSE, which dominates the ZQE.\nProof : Proofs of all numbered results other than corollaries are located in Appendix A.\nTable 2 is illustrated in Figure 1, which displays the (Pareto efficient) equilibrium regions with respect to the testing technology, \u03c6 = (\u03c60, \u03c61), and the group\u2019s potential, p, for a given, arbitrary pair of \u201clow cost level,\u201d cL, and wage, w. The principal point of the single-group analysis is to establish a baseline for examining the effects of labor market heterogeneity and differential information on qualification, employment, and welfare.\nNote that, in both panes of Figure 1, the 45 degree dashed line represents the continuum of situations in which \u03c60 = \u03c61 and, as intuition would suggest, there are exactly two possible Pareto optimal equilibria in these cases: when \u03c60 = \u03c61 is close enough to 0, then the unique equilibrium is a ZQE in which nobody gets qualified and nobody gets hired, because the moral hazard problem is \u201ctoo severe\u201d to sustain credible hiring in equilibrium, and otherwise the unique sequential equilibrium is an FQE in which all workers erwise independent of the parameters of the model. The mixed strategy equilibrium, when it exists, on the other hand, is sensitive to the exact values of these parameters.\nget qualified if and only if c = cL. In such cases, the employer\u2019s hiring strategy is aggressive if potential (p) is sufficiently high and conservative otherwise.\nWith the equilibrium analysis of the single-group case in hand, we now extend the model to allow for two groups of workers, one of which has greater potential than the other."

Consequently, if both groups have high potentials (p1 > p2 > p\u2217E), then BTB can have no effect\non equilibrium behavior when comparing the Pareto optimal equilibrium in each case.21 The same logic follows if both groups have low potential (p\u2217E > p1 > p2): in this case, the employer will always use a conservative hiring strategy in equilibrium, regardless of whether the box is present or not. This leads to the following corollary of Proposition 1, which we present without proof.\nCorollary 1 Banning the box can affect Pareto efficient equilibrium behavior and/or welfare only if the groups have statistically distinct potentials: p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2.\nThe following remark is separated out in order to clarify the relationship between this\nmodel and other theoretical analyses of discrimination.\nRemark 2 Note that, as we do throughout, Corollary 1 restricts our comparisons to Pareto efficient equilibria. This focus separates our analysis from that provided by Coate and Loury (1993) (and many other models of Arrovian statistical discrimination), because in that model, the causal mechanism for discrimination operates through the role of a worker\u2019s group membership as an equilibrium selection device.\nUninformative Testing Structures. Corollary 1 identifies only a necessary condition for BTB to have an effect on equilibrium behavior. It is not sufficient \u2014 Figure 1 also depicts situations in which the groups have statistically distinct potentials, but BTB still has no\n21As mentioned above (footnote 9 on page 7), we are focusing on Pareto efficient equilibria throughout so that the presence or absence of the box does not have an effect on outcomes merely as an equilibrium selection device.\neffect on equilibrium behavior. This occurs when both \u03c61 and \u03c60 are low. In this case the test result is so noisy that it is not in any worker\u2019s interest to invest in qualification. The most straightforward example of this scenario would be when \u03c61 and \u03c60 both approach zero. In the limit, every applicant would receive a test score of 2 regardless of qualification status, and no applicant would choose to become qualified. Again, this is summarized in the following corollary to Proposition 1, which is also presented without proof.\nCorollary 2 When the test is uninformative (max[\u03c60, \u03c61] < cLw ), BTB has no effect on equilibrium behavior or welfare.\nCorollaries 1 and 2 separately indicate the theoretical limits of BTB as a policy tool for ameliorating discrimination in hiring and, more fundamentally, illustrate the \u201cinformational foundations\u201d of BTB\u2019s impact (or lack thereof) on equilibrium qualification and hiring. Corollary 1 highlights that BTB can have an impact on statistical discrimination only if the employer\u2019s beliefs about the two groups are statistically distinct, implying that the employer would treat workers from the two groups differently conditional on a garbled test result even if the employer believes that workers from both groups were obtaining qualification whenever qualification is not strictly dominated. Corollary 2 clarifies that BTB can have an effect only if the testing structure is sufficiently precise.\nTaken together, the two results indicate that \u201ccoarsening\u201d the employer\u2019s information by obscuring an applicant\u2019s group membership can have an impact on outcomes only if the employer\u2019s information about applicants \u2014 encompassing both his or her prior beliefs\nabout the groups\u2019 potentials and his or her interim information about the applicant in question\u2019s true qualification \u2014 is sufficiently rich. Put another way, Corollary 1 states that the box can have an impact only if the employer might treat workers from the two groups differently even if they are using the same strategy to obtain qualification, and Corollary 2 states that the box can have impact only if the employer\u2019s information about any given worker\u2019s qualification is sufficiently precise for the employer to actually condition upon the test result when making his or her hiring decision.\nWe now turn to situations in which BTB has an impact on equilibrium outcomes, fo-\ncusing first on those in which BTB affects only E\u2019s equilibrium hiring strategy, \u03b7."

            "text": "By Corollary 1 we know that, for BTB to have an impact, it must be the case that the groups have statistically distinct potentials (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2). Figure 1 illustrates that when \u03c61 \u2265 cL w and \u03c60 \u2265 cL w , an FQE exists when the box is present. Consequently, regardless of whether E hires aggressively or conservatively, all low-cost workers are incentivized to obtain qualification. However, BTB may affect E\u2019s equilibrium hiring strategy. Because of this, the welfare effects of BTB are ambiguous, as summarized in the following corollary.\nCorollary 3 When the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2) and the test is uniformly informative (min[\u03c60, \u03c61] \u2265 cLw ), employer behavior is affected by the box but worker behavior is not, and BTB has ambiguous welfare effects:\n\u2022 If population potential is high (p \u2265 p\u2217E), BTB induces E to hire all workers aggressively,\nleaving the payoffs of group 1 workers unchanged and strictly benefiting group 2 workers,\n\u2022 If population potential is low (p < p\u2217 E ), BTB induces E to hire all workers conservatively,\nstrictly hurting group 1 workers and leaving the payoffs of group 2 workers unchanged,\n\u2022 Regardless of population potential, E is made strictly worse off by BTB.\nIn addition to illustrating that the workers and employer might have opposed preferences about the presence of the box, Corollary 3 illustrates the central role of statistical discrimination in our theory by highlighting the importance of the population potential for the workers\u2019 induced preferences about the box\u2019s presence. When the population at large has high potential, then BTB helps workers in the disadvantaged group and, conversely, when the population has low potential, BTB hurts workers in the advantaged group.\nWhen the Box Affects Worker and Employer Behavior. When the box does not affect worker incentives, the only effect the box can have is on employer behavior. In this case, the employer is always hiring sub-optimally relative to the full-information environment in which E can observe group type, and BTB always makes E worse off. BTB may make W better or worse off depending on the base rate of potential in the total population relative to W \u2019s group potential.\nHowever, when BTB affects worker incentives to obtain qualification, the welfare effects of the box are more nuanced. In these cases E may strictly prefer to ban the box if\ndoing so can stimulate a greater number of workers to become qualified in equilibrium. In these situations where E prefers to ban the box it may also be the case that W prefers to ban the box too, and BTB can represent a Pareto improvement. It can also be the case that BTB stimulates worker qualification and benefits E while hurting W . And finally, it can be the case that BTB can reduce worker incentives to become qualified, leading to losses by both E and W . This final case represents a situation in which observing group labels in the hiring decision is Pareto superior to BTB.\n6.3 BTB With a Positively Informative Test: \u03c61 \u2265 cLw > \u03c60\nWe first consider positively informative test structures. In such testing structures, the test result is more precise for workers who are qualified (q = 1) than for workers who are unqualified (q = 0). In the Pareto efficient equilibrium in this case, workers in the disadvantaged group (g = 2) obtain full qualification (\u03c7\u2217 = 1) and E hires conservatively from this group (\u03b7\u2217(2) = 0). On the other hand, the employer E and workers in the advantaged group (g = 1) are playing mixed strategies in the Pareto efficient equilibrium, as characterized by Equations 10 and 11 (substituting the term p1 for p in those equations). E would like to hire aggressively from group 1, but doing so would eliminate W \u2019s incentive to obtain qualification because the low \u03c60 means that it is likely an unqualified person will send a signal of 2.\nIn such cases, BTB has two potential effects, depending on whether the potential of the population at large, p, is high or low. Specifically, when this potential is high, BTB will\ninduce all workers and E to play an MSE, again characterized by Equations 10 and 11, (in this case, substituting the term p for p in those equations). When p < p\u2217E then BTB will shift all workers to an FQE in which E hires conservatively. The welfare effects of the box in these cases are not immediately obvious, so we begin with the following lemma.\nLemma 1 Regardless of which group a worker belongs to, and whether the box is used or not, W \u2019s expected payoff from the potential mixed strategy equilibrium profile, (\u03c7\u2217, \u03b7\u2217) = (\u03c7M(p), \u03b7M ), is independent of the worker\u2019s realized cost of qualification, c \u2208 {cL, cH}, and equal to the following:\nEUW (MSE) \u2261 (1 \u2212 \u03c60)(\u03c61w \u2212 cL) \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60 ,\nwhile W \u2019s conditional expected payoff in a full qualification equilibrium with conservative hiring, given c \u2208 {cL, cH}, is:\nEUW (FQE \u2223 \u03b7\u2217 = 0, c) \u2261 \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 \u03c61w \u2212 cL if c = cL 0 if c = cH .\nThe next proposition establishes that the worker\u2019s and employer\u2019s induced preferences regarding BTB are opposed when the test is positively informative and population potential is low.\nProposition 2 If the test is positively informative (\u03c61 \u2265 cL w > \u03c60), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is low (p < p \u2217 E), then W and E have opposed preferences over the box: E prefers that the box be present, W prefers that the box be banned.\nOn the other hand, in contrast with Proposition 2, the worker\u2019s and employer\u2019s induced preferences regarding BTB are aligned in favor of BTB when the test is positively informative and population potential is high. Using the phrase BTB Pareto dominates the Box to describe any situation in which there is a Pareto efficient equilibrium without the box that offers both players strictly higher (expected) payoffs than any equilibrium when the box is present, this is stated formally in the following proposition.22\nProposition 3 If the test is positively informative (\u03c61 \u2265 cL w > \u03c60), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is high (p > p \u2217 E), then \u201cBTB Pareto dominates the Box,\u201d strictly benefiting E and group 2 workers, and leaving the payoffs of group 1 workers unchanged.\nProposition 3 is one of the key results of our analysis, but we defer discussion of it until Section 7.\n6.4 BTB With a Negatively Informative Test: \u03c60 > cLw > \u03c61\nWe now consider negatively informative test structures, in which the test result is more precise for unqualified workers than it is for qualified workers. In the Pareto efficient equilibrium with the box, workers in the disadvantaged group (g = 2) obtain no qualification (q = 0). E would hire conservatively from this group (\u03b7\u2217(2) = 0), and consequently the 22By alluding to expected payoffs, we are referring to the worker\u2019s expected payoff prior to learning which group he or she is a member of (and, of course, prior to knowing the test result, \u03b8).\nreturn to investment on qualification is too low to make qualification profitable. No one in the disadvantaged group becomes qualified, and no one is hired. Workers in the advantaged group (g = 1) obtain full qualification, and E hires from this group aggressively (\u03b7\u2217(1) = 1). With the box, the payoff for all workers in group 1 is strictly positive:\nw \u2212 cL > 0 if c = cL and w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) > 0 if c = cH .\nThe expected payoff for E in this case is\n\u03b3(p1(B \u2212w) \u2212w(1 \u2212 p1)(1 \u2212 \u03c60)) > 0.\nThis payoff is strictly positive in this case because p1 \u2265 p\u2217E (otherwise BTB has no effect on equilibrium behavior): E receives a strictly positive payoff from hiring individuals from group 1 receiving a test score of \u03b8 = 3 and a non-negative payoff for hiring individuals receiving a \u03b8 = 2.\nOur first result in this case is that BTB hurts both workers and the employer when\npopulation potential is low.\nProposition 4 When the test is negatively informative (\u03c60 > cL w > \u03c61), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is low (p < p \u2217 E), BTB is Pareto inefficient.\nProposition 4 is informative: BTB will reduce employment in equilibrium when the population has low potential. This can occur for one or more of three reasons: (1) the advantaged workers have moderately high potential (p1 \u2248 p\u2217E), (2) the disadvantaged workers\nhave sufficiently low potential (p2 is too close to zero), and/or (3) the advantaged group is not particularly large (\u03b3 is too low). While of course group potentials might vary across different types of jobs, we believe that the third category is the most interesting. This is because \u03b3 reflects the proportion of applicants for the position in question who come from the advantaged group. It is well documented that gender, racial, and ethnic compositions of the workforce vary\u2014sometimes widely\u2014across different types of jobs. Unfortunately, with this in mind, Proposition 4 suggests that BTB may not be as effective at promoting increased employment in sectors that are already disproportionately applied for by citizens from relatively disadvantaged groups.23\nOur second, complementary, result in this case is that BTB benefits workers when\npopulation potential is high.\nProposition 5 When the test is negatively informative (\u03c60 > cL w > \u03c61), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is high (p \u2265 p \u2217 E), BTB strictly benefits group 2 workers and leaves the payoffs of group 1 workers unchanged.\nFinally, when p \u2265 p\u2217E the effect of BTB is ambiguous for the employer, and depends on whether E receives a positive or negative expected payoff from hiring individuals from group 2 aggressively. We have assumed that p2 < p\u2217E , and so it is not sequentially rational for E to hire an individual from group 2 receiving \u03b8 = 2. This leads to no qualification\n23Of course, there are many reasons for demographic variation across different jobs, including variation in wages. Our point here is meant only to be suggestive regarding the empirical implications of our analysis.\nby group 2 when E can observe group identity. However, E may strictly benefit from committing to aggressively hire from this group, because doing so stimulates a full qualification equilibrium. BTB can serve as a commitment device for E to hire aggressively, when such commitment would not be possible if group identity were observed. The following proposition details when this commitment benefits E.\nProposition 6 When the test is negatively informative (\u03c60 > cL w > \u03c61), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is high (p \u2265 p \u2217 E), BTB Pareto dominates the Box if\np2 \u2208 [w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) B \u2212w\u03c60 , p\u2217E) ,\nand E is hurt by BTB if\np2 < w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) B \u2212w\u03c60 .\nAgain, we defer discussion of this result (along with its sibling, Proposition 3) to Section 7. Prior to that, we briefly summarize and illustrate the equilibrium effects of BTB.\nThe Equilibrium Effects of (and Induced Preferences for) BTB. Figure 1 depicts the equilibrium regions for the cases of low and high group potential (i.e., whether p is less than or greater than p, respectively).\nMirroring Figure 1, Figure 2 depicts regions on which BTB can affect outcomes. Figure 2 illustrates that the effect of BTB depends critically on whether the population potential, p = \u03b3p1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)p2, is high or low."

            "text": "The finding that BTB can by Pareto dominant is arguably the most provocative of the conclusions we obtain from this framework. Along these lines, it is informative to contrast Propositions 3 and 6.\nConditional Effects of the Testing Structure. Propositions 3 and 6 are distinguished by the exogenous nature of the testing technology, a point to which we return below (Section 8). They are unified, however, by their common reliance on population potential. When population potential (p) is low, BTB can only hurt the workers, but the impact of BTB on the employer is conditional on the testing structure:\n\u2022 When the test is negatively informative, the employer is hurt by BTB, but\n\u2022 When the test is positively informative, the employer is helped by BTB.\nThis distinction raises the question of what these testing structures represent in substantive terms. In terms of robustness, it is important to note that our analysis does not rely on the assumption that a qualified worker (q = 1) can never receive a score of \u03b8 = 1 or that an unqualified worker (q = 0) can never receive a score of \u03b8 = 3: these probabilities can be positive, so long as they are not too large. With this in mind, one description of the distinction in employment situations is with respect to whether qualifications for the job in question are possible to directly demonstrate (either in one\u2019s record or during the hiring process).\n\u2022 Negatively Informative Tests. For many entry-level positions, there are few objec-\ntive indicators that an individual is specifically qualified for the position. On the other hand, there may be several indicators that an individual is not qualified for such a position.24 For example, while some \u201cgeneral\u201d credentials, such as a high school or college diploma, are relatively easy to verify, they arguably reflect more in their absence than in their presence. In our model, then, the absence of such a qualification represents \u03b8 = 1, but a test result of \u03b8 = 3 would be relatively rare, requiring additional evidence (e.g., a credible and personalized recommendation from a teacher with personal knowledge of the applicant\u2019s abilities) that might, but 24This asymmetry is due, in part, to the reality that an entry-level position typically does not require that one have held a similar job in the past. In the modern economy, many such jobs are in retail and customer service positions that do not depend heavily upon task-specific expertise.\nneed not, emerge from successfully completing the course of study leading to the diploma.\n\u2022 Positively Informative Tests. As opposed to entry-level positions, more advanced\npositions often require task-specific experience and skills that can be more easily \u201cdirectly\u201d verified.25 Similarly, for more advanced positions that require specific experience, it is reasonable to suppose that such performance might be gradated into more refined categories, ranging from \u201cabove the bar\u201d (\u03b8 = 2) to \u201cclearly qualified\u201d (\u03b8 = 3). Our analysis requires only that it is rare for a person with the appropriate skills to be identified as \u201cclearly unqualified.\u201d\nThe Positive Role of BTB for the Employer. When the employer benefits from BTB in our framework, it is because BTB is solving a commitment problem for the employer. For example, BTB is playing this role whenever BTB benefits the employer but not the worker (e.g., when population potential is low and the test is positively informative). This reflects a key simplifying assumption of the model: the worker does not care about qualification, per se, and we return to this general point below (Section 8) regarding E\u2019s incentives to adopt BTB unilaterally.\n25For example, it is arguably easier to reliably infer that an applicant has knowledge of a specific programming language than that the applicant is generally unflappable in a wide array of customer service settings.\nPareto Efficiency & Inequality. Even when BTB is Pareto dominant in our framework, it nonetheless has uneven impacts on welfare. Comparisons between W and E are difficult for typical reasons (e.g., such a comparison depends on the exogenous parameters B and w), but a similar comparison between the two groups of workers is more straightforward. When BTB is Pareto dominant, its adoption strictly benefits only disadvantaged workers. This mirrors much of the policy and scholarly discussion regarding BTB.\nHowever, this one-sided nature of the welfare impact of BTB is essentially \u201cbuilt into\u201d the model because of our assumption that the two groups of workers differ only in terms of potential (as opposed to, for example, the precision of the testing structure). Furthermore, the definition of potential is with respect to the employer\u2019s payoffs,26 so that any given individual might have a high potential for some employers and low potential for others.\nSome takeaway conclusions from Figure 2 can be summarized as follows.\n1. BTB has no effect when the test is uninformative (i.e., when max[\u03c60, \u03c61] < cLw ). BTB has no effect on outcomes or welfare when the employer\u2019s information is too imprecise for\nthe employer to be responsive in equilibrium to the test result, \u03b8. This conclusion is particularly important for \u201clow information\u201d situations such as when workers first enter the workforce.\nIn our model, the testing structure is exogenous, but in a larger model in which the 26Again, as mentioned above, the worker is assumed to be indifferent with respect to his or her qualifica-\ntion beyond the cost of becoming qualified.\ndistribution of \u03b8 is more precise for workers with (say) longer employment histories, the lower left region of Figure 2 indicates that BTB policies might not have strong effects on outcomes in labor markets where many of the applicants do not have extensive work histories. Given that people convicted of a felony in the United States tend to have their first felony conviction before they are 25 years old,27 our analysis offers a reason to temper expectations about the efficacy of BTB in terms of helping convicted felons enter the work force.\n2. BTB hurts the employer when the test is uniformly informative (i.e., when min[\u03c60, \u03c61] > cL w ). In these cases, the worker\u2019s moral hazard problem is relatively insignificant\nfrom the employer\u2019s perspective. For example, for any (\u03c60, \u03c61) \u2248 (1,1), the employer essentially faces no moral hazard problem. In this case, hiding the worker\u2019s group membership from the employer can only hurt the employer when groups have statistically distinct potentials (i.e., p1 > p\u2217E > p2)."

            "text": "From an empirical standpoint, Propositions 2\u20136 indicate situations in which employers and/or workers would support or oppose BTB.28 We discuss these incentives briefly, be-\n27For example, see Table 7 of Benson and Kerley (2001). 28For simplicity, in the brief discussion below, we set aside cases where \u03c60 and \u03c61 are both too low to sustain positive employment in equilibrium. These are identified by the lower left regions in both panes of Figure 2.\nginning with the two groups of workers and then moving to the employer.\nWorkers. Regarding the worker\u2019s incentives about BTB, the key parameters of interest are (1) whether the worker is advantaged or not and (2) whether population potential is high or low:\n\u2022 Advantaged workers never benefit from BTB and\n\u2022 When population potential is high, disadvantaged workers are never harmed by BTB.\nFrom an empirical perspective, it can be useful to think of the two groups of workers (advantaged and disadvantaged) as being distinguished by the likelihood of being hired in the presence of the box. From this perspective, the conclusion is intuitive: disadvantaged workers have more to gain from BTB than do advantaged workers. It is important to note that our model considers only two groups. If we extended the analysis to three or more groups (differentiated, as here, only by their potentials), the \u201cclean\u201d conclusions regarding advantaged and disadvantaged workers would apply only to the groups with the highest potential (advantaged) or lowest potential (disadvantaged). All groups with intermediate potentials could either gain or lose from adoption of BTB.\nOf course, workers may have other concerns related to BTB beyond the instrumental motivations focused on here (e.g., altruism, \u201cexpressive\u201d motivations for BTB, concerns about inequality, etc.), so these conclusions should be seen as simply implying that workers from relatively advantaged groups may be less likely to lobby for adoption of BTB\nthan workers from disadvantaged groups. At the industry or occupation levels, this implies that one might see more active lobbying for BTB policies in jobs or sectors that tend to have higher proportions of applicants who come from disadvantaged groups. This logic implies that jobs that require significant work experience (or, perhaps verified educational attainment) will tend to receive less focus in policy debates regarding BTB. At least on a cursory glance, this jibes with real-world experience: BTB policies appear to be most actively lobbied for in entry-level and/or early career positions.\nSimilarly, in terms of the workers\u2019 potentially divergent interests regarding BTB, it is important to note that our model\u2019s minimal structure implies that it is never the case that one group of workers will strictly benefit from, while the other group is strictly harmed by, BTB. If we interpret \u201cis not harmed by BTB\u201d as \u201cmight be harmed by BTB\u201d and \u201cis not helped by BTB\u201d as \u201cmight benefit otherwise from BTB,\u201d then the model readily identifies situations in which there may be conflict about BTB among workers. Indeed, the theory indicates that such conflict might be quite common \u2014 in any situation in which there is an equilibrium with the box banned in which workers get hired with a positive probability, the advantaged workers can only be harmed by BTB and the disadvantaged workers can only benefit from it. Such a possibility seems even more likely to emerge if we allowed the employer to choose from two applicants, with randomly determined group memberships. In such a \u201ccompetitive\u201d hiring model, the advantaged workers will strictly benefit from the box in expectation and the disadvantaged workers will be similarly, strictly, harmed by the box\u2019s presence. Even beginning the analysis of such an extension is clearly\nbeyond the scope of this article, but the possibilities apparent in such an extension seem worthy of exploration.\nEmployers. One of the most surprising aspects of our analysis is its conclusion that BTB can sometimes benefit the employer. One substantive implication from the analysis is that the employer always prefers BTB when the test is positively informative, but not necessarily when the test is negatively informative.\nThough BTB\u2019s effects depend on population potential, the employer\u2019s preferences for BTB are independent of population potential when the test is positively informative. From this, one might expect that employers will be more receptive of BTB policies \u2014 perhaps even committing to BTB unilaterally \u2014 for positions in which qualification is relatively likely to be clearly indicated through the test result (i.e., \u03b8 = 3). This might induce conflict between the employer and workers \u2014 particularly workers from the advantaged group \u2014 when population potential is low.29\nWhen the test is negatively informative, on the other hand, the employer can gain 29An interesting ancillary implication of this \u2014 related to the question of voluntary disclosure (discussed in Section 9 on page 51, below) \u2014 is that workers who seek to \u201csignal their group membership\u201d through their (unmodeled here) lobbying efforts for/against BTB may have an incentive to lobby insincerely: disadvantaged workers might lobby against BTB if they believe that (1) BTB might actually be adopted and (2) the employer might observe this lobbying effort and thereby possibly incorporate this lobbying effort into E\u2019s beliefs about W \u2019s group membership if W ever applies for a job from E. Of course, such behavior is consistent with other dynamic motivations, but the congruence is nonetheless intriguing.\nfrom BTB only if population potential is high. From an empirical perspective, this implies that employers should be more receptive to BTB policies for positions in which relatively few applicants are from the disadvantaged group (otherwise, population potential would be low if the groups have statistically distinct potentials). Accordingly, the employer\u2019s interests in BTB are not entirely in line with social welfare maximization.\nThis partial divergence between E\u2019s incentives and social welfare is further exacerbated by the fact that E\u2019s preference for BTB when the test is negatively informative is conditional: from Proposition6, E will prefer BTB in this case only if the disadvantaged group\u2019s potential is not too low:\np2 \u2208 [w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) B \u2212w\u03c60 , w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) B(1 \u2212 \u03c61) +w(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60)) , (13)\nwhere we have replaced the upper bound, p\u2217E , with its formal definition.\nFrom (13), it follows that \u2014 for jobs in which the test structure is negatively informa-\ntive \u2014 employers should be more likely to support/adopt BTB when\n1. the market wage, w, is low,\n2. the employer\u2019s gain from successful hiring (B) is large, and/or\n3. the test is very likely to clearly reveal lack of qualification (high \u03c60).\nThese conclusions are partially congruent with the fact that much of the discussion of BTB \u201cas policy\u201d (e.g., where some wish to impose BTB on private employers, as opposed\nto employers voluntarily adopting BTB) revolves around entry level positions, where indicators of qualification are frequently imprecise. Formally, if (\u03c60, \u03c61) \u2192 (0,0) (a completely uninformative testing structure), the lower and upper bounds of (13) converge to w B . Eventually, any such sequence of probabilities will support only zero qualification equilibria (the lower left corner region of the plots in Figure 2), but regardless, the employer will not support BTB in the limit. Note that, in spite of this, disadvantaged workers will never oppose BTB in the sequence of situations determined by {(\u03c60, \u03c61)t}\u221et=1. Thus, the theory suggests that a potential cause for conflict about BTB is severe informational imperfection in the moral hazard problem facing E and W in the hiring process."

            "text": "When discrimination occurs due to disparate treatment, the decision-maker must be able to observe or infer others\u2019 group memberships. We have examined how and whether eliminating this information, which necessarily eliminates one form of discrimination, might affect qualification, employment rates, and welfare. This approach is distinct from traditional approaches to eliminating discrimination, which take as given that the employer has access to the information required for discrimination.\nPolicies intended to eliminate discrimination on the basis of group membership typically prohibit hiring procedures that explicitly utilize group information; these policies prohibit disparate treatment. A response taken by some to abide by such prohibitions is\nto not collect information on group membership.30 However, in some cases, collection of this information is unavoidable, either by direct observation or by inference from other information about the applicant, such as their date of graduation, the schools they have attended, and so forth.\nLess closely related are requirements that the decisions not be (too strongly) correlated with applicants\u2019 group memberships (i.e., prohibiting disparate impact). Such prohibitions are arguably more appropriately aimed at outcomes, rather than process. However, they can have spillover effects, whereby attempts to protect one group may reduce welfare for all individuals (e.g., Coate and Loury (1993)).\nDiscrimination and Big Data. While we have framed the discussion of the model within the context of the Ban the Box movement, it of course has implications for information about any characteristics of the applicants. Furthermore, the framework can easily be extended to incorporate noisy signals about group membership, so that the employer must form non-degenerate beliefs after observing some exogenous, imperfectly informative information about the applicant\u2019s characteristics. Particularly in the new age of algorithms and \u201cbig data,\u201d the data solicited for decision-making can have subtle and powerful im-\n30Clearly, for any given employment decision, certain group memberships are appropriate considerations for the employer (for example, does the applicant have a high school diploma?). Accordingly, in practice, discrimination is legally barred only with respect to certain group memberships. For example, in the United States, federal anti-discrimination laws generally protect against discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability.\npacts on outcomes (Patty and Penn (2015); Kleinberg et al. (2018)). The power of certain information is of course not new \u2014 it doesn\u2019t require a supercomputer for an employer to discriminate against employees based on race, gender, criminal record, or any other single factor. However, with massive, and often proprietary, data sets and algorithms, it is much more difficult to predict which subset of seemingly innocuous questions might be, either explicitly or implicitly, used as the basis for discrimination (Barocas and Selbst (2016)). Such discrimination can emerge in various settings, including college admissions, employment, purchasing insurance, and obtaining credit.31\nExtensions. The model has several avenues for extension. We briefly describe five of these below.\n1. Endogenous Wages. The analysis in this article assumes that the employer must\noffer an exogenously determined wage when he or she hires a worker. We are currently relaxing this assumption in ongoing work, but several constraints preclude us from reporting the preliminary results in detail. One important fact that can be inferred from the analysis reported in this article is that the employer has less \u201cneed for\u201d information about an applicant\u2019s group membership if the employer can choose (and commit to) a wage prior to the worker choosing whether to get quali31Beyond the scope of this article, but related, is the emerging topic of how algorithmic systems may produce disparate mistreatment: situations in which the algorithm\u2019s decisions are more accurate for one group than for another (Zafar et al. (2017)).\nfied. This can be seen in several places, but perhaps the most transparent is Figure 1, in which the horizontal and/or vertical lines in the two panes are each a function of the wage, w.\n2. Group-Specific Testing Accuracy. Our analysis above assumes that the only dis-\ntinction between the two groups is their potential, a notion grounded in inherent opportunities available to the individuals in the two groups. A complementary analysis would consider the implications of the testing technology (i.e., the distribution of \u03b8 conditional on qualification, q) depending on the worker\u2019s group. Such an analysis would be interesting for several reasons, including raising the possibility that banning the test itself might be socially optimal.\n3. Intersectionality. Our analysis focuses on the case in which there are two (observ-\nable) groups of workers. Reality is of course more complicated: there are many forms of group membership that are relevant in the awarding of selective benefits (e.g., race, ethnicity, citizenship, age, gender, and veteran status). Most interesting about such an extension is the potential to explore the implications and challenges of issues of intersectionality \u2014\u201cthe way in which various forms of inequality often operate together and exacerbate each other\u201d32 \u2014 when considering the impact of supplemental information on allocating scarce resources. 32Kimberle\u0301 Crenshaw, quoted in \u201cShe Coined the Term \u2018Intersectionality\u2019 Over 30 Years Ago. Here\u2019s What It Means to Her Today,\u201d by Katy Steinmetz, TIME, February 20, 2020. For a very recent formal contribution along these lines, see Stewart (2021).\n4. Voluntary Disclosure. Our analysis is centered on the effects of information about\nan individual\u2019s traits. In reality, this information is often solicited by the employer, as opposed to being directly observed. Accordingly, an important extension of the model would be to include voluntary provision/revelation of this information within the model itself.\n5. Competitive Hiring. As mentioned in Section 8 (pg. 44), one direction to extend\nthe model is to incorporate the possibility that the employer will have a larger set of applicants to choose from than the number of positions he or she needs to hire. This extension, as mentioned above, would appear to induce strict preferences for the workers about BTB in a way that is richer than captured in the model analyzed here and could offer a useful springboard for analyzing under what conditions (say) a government might find it in its (political, electoral, and/or economic) interest to impose BTB as a matter of public policy.\nConcluding Thoughts. We have presented a highly stylized model of hiring with moral hazard with the aim of considering the impact of heterogeneity among workers in terms of the opportunity to become qualified and, more specifically, the impact of the employer\u2019s granular information about this heterogeneity in the hiring process. Policies such as Ban the Box are aimed squarely at \u201cleveling the playing field\u201d for individuals from different backgrounds. Our analysis indicates some of the promises \u2014 and pitfalls \u2014 of such policies. In line with empirical evidence, the theory highlights the generally\npositive impact such policies will have on disadvantaged workers and the weakly negative impact they might have on advantaged workers.\nIn contrast, the theory also indicates unsurprisingly that such policies can sometimes harm employers, while at the same time offering (to us, at least) an unexpected conclusion: sometimes employers can strictly benefit from these policies if they are foreseen and reacted to by workers in the disadvantaged group(s). Furthermore, the theory isolates one classic game theoretic reason for this potential salutary impact: the employers in some cases benefit from the \u201cignorance\u201d imposed on the employer by such policies because the concomitant lack of ability for the employer to discriminate between workers from the two groups can provide instrumental incentives to workers from such groups to make costly investments in qualification in the hopes of obtaining employment on the now-leveled \u201cplaying field.\u201d\nWhile our model omits many interesting features of real-world employment markets, we think that the minimalism of the model highlights the ubiquity of the potential Pareto efficiency of partially \u201cblinding\u201d decision-makers engaged in distributing rewards among citizens."

For the first four cases, note that when p > p\u2217E, as defined in (12), E receives a strictly positive payoff from hiring \u03b8 = 2 if all low types have chosen qualification. When p < p\u2217 E then E receives a strictly negative payoff from hiring \u03b8 = 2 if all low types have chosen\nqualification, and E will consequently never hire if observing \u03b8 = 2.\nREGION 1. p > p\u2217 E and w\u03c60 > cL > w\u03c61. Because p > p\u2217E, \u03b7 = 1 is a unique best response to \u03c7 = 1. As \u03c60w > cL, Equation (8) is satisfied and \u03c7 = 1 is a unique best response to \u03b7 = 1. Consequently, there is an FQE with \u03b7\u2217 = 1 and \u03c7\u2217 = 1 and no other pure strategy equilibrium with full qualification. It is straightforward to verify that when p > p\u2217E and w\u03c60 > cL > w\u03c61, then \u03b7M \u2208 (0,1) and \u03c7M(p) \u2208 (0,1), where \u03b7M and \u03c7M(p) are characterized by Equation (10) and (11). Therefore there also exists a mixed strategy equilibrium for this parameter region. Finally, Equation 9 does not hold in this case, as cL > w\u03c61 and \u03c7 = 0 is a best response to \u03b7 = 0. It follows that there also exists a zero qualification equilibrium in this region.\nREGION 2. p > p\u2217E and w\u03c60 > cL and w\u03c61 > cL. As in the above case, \u03b7 \u2217 = 1 is a unique best response to \u03c7\u2217 = 1 and vice versa because p > p\u2217E and \u03c60w > cL. However in this case there is no MSE, because when w\u03c61 > cL and w\u03c60 > cL, E can\u2019t choose a hiring strategy \u03b7 to make W indifferent between qualification and no qualification. Regardless of E\u2019s hiring strategy, it is always strictly optimal for W to choose q = 1.\nREGION 3. p > p\u2217E and w\u03c61 > cL > w\u03c60. In this case, there does not exist a pure strategy equilibrium. If \u03c7 = 1 then E optimally chooses \u03b7 = 1, as p > p\u2217 E . However, Equation (8) does not hold; when E hires those receiving \u03b8 = 2 \u201caggressively\u201d (i.e. \u03b7 = 1) and when\n\u03c60 is sufficiently low, W is incentivized to not obtain qualification. However, if W obtains no qualification then E will not hire if observing \u03b8 = 2. In this case there is only a mixed strategy equilibrium, and again it is straightforward to verify that when p > p\u2217 E and w\u03c61 > cL > w\u03c60 then \u03b7M \u2208 (0,1) and \u03c7M(p) \u2208 (0,1).\nREGION 4. cL > w\u03c60 and cL > w\u03c61. In this case Equation 6 can never obtain for any value of \u03b7. It follows that \u03c7\u2217 = 0 and \u03b7\u2217 = 0 is the unique equilibrium.\nREGION 5. p < p\u2217E and cL > w\u03c61. In these remaining two cases E always sets \u03b7 \u2217 = 0, because p < p\u2217E . When cL > w\u03c61 then Equation (9) does not hold, and W sets \u03c7 \u2217 = 0.\nREGION 6. p < p\u2217 E and w\u03c61 > cL. In this last case Equation (9) does hold, and W sets \u03c7\u2217 = 1.\nPARETO RANKING EQUILIBRIA IN REGION 1. We conclude by ranking the 3 equilibria in Region 1 (w\u03c60 > cL > w\u03c61 and p > p\u2217E) according to the Pareto principle. It is straightforward to show that the full qualification equilibrium with \u03c7\u2217 = 1, \u03b7\u2217 = 1 Pareto dominates the mixed strategy equilibrium. To see this, note that at an MSE, the low-cost worker must be indifferent between obtaining qualification and not, and the employer must be indifferent between hiring a worker with \u03b8 = 2 and not, and so must receive an expected payoff of zero conditional on \u03b8 = 2. However, when p > p\u2217 E , E receives a strictly positive payoff in the FQE from hiring a worker with \u03b8 = 2. Moreover, at the FQE there is a higher\nprobability a randomly drawn worker will receive a \u03b8 = 3 (as there is a higher probability q = 1), and a lower probability that a randomly drawn worker will receive \u03b8 = 0. Thus, E receives a strictly higher expected payoff in the FQE than in the MSE.\nIn the MSE, a low-cost worker receives a (positive) expected payoff of (1 \u2212 \u03c6o)w\u22c5 = (1\u2212\u03c60)(cL\u2212w\u03c61)\n\u03c60\u2212\u03c61 . In the FQE, W receives an expected payoff of w\u2212cL. The difference between\nthese payoffs is\nw \u2212 cL \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c60)(cL \u2212w\u03c61) \u03c60 \u2212 \u03c61 = (1 \u2212 \u03c61)(\u03c60w \u2212 cL) \u03c60 \u2212 \u03c61 ,\nwhich, by inspection, is strictly positive when w\u03c60 > cL > w\u03c61. Therefore, a low-cost worker strictly prefers the FQE to the MSE when both equilibria exist and high-cost workers also strictly prefer the FQE to the MSE, because at the FQE the employer is hiring all workers who receive \u03b8 = 2, which strictly benefits workers who are not qualified. Finally, note that both the FQE and MSE are strictly Pareto superior to the ZQE, in which both players receive a payoff of 0 with certainty.\nLemma 1 Regardless of which group a worker belongs to, and whether the box is used or not, W \u2019s expected payoff from the potential mixed strategy equilibrium profile, (\u03c7\u2217, \u03b7\u2217) = (\u03c7M(p), \u03b7M ), is independent of the worker\u2019s realized cost of qualification, c \u2208 {cL, cH}, and equal to the following:\nEUW (MSE) \u2261 (1 \u2212 \u03c60)(\u03c61w \u2212 cL) \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60 ,\nwhile W \u2019s conditional expected payoff in a full qualification equilibrium with conservative hiring,\ngiven c \u2208 {cL, cH}, is:\nEUW (FQE \u2223 \u03b7\u2217 = 0, c) \u2261 \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 \u03c61w \u2212 cL if c = cL 0 if c = cH .\nProof : Any mixed strategy equilibrium is characterized by Equations 10 and 11, with group potential p varying depending on the group being considered (i.e. whether it is a subgroup with potential pg or the set of all workers with potential p). Note that E\u2019s mixed strategy, \u03b7\u2217 M , is not a function of group potential. E is simply making W indifferent between qualification and no qualification, and this indifference is solely dependent on costs to qualification, wages, and the testing technology, all of which are invariant to the presence or absence of the box.33\nAny worker playing an MSE will receive an expected payoff of\n\u03c7M(w(\u03c61 + (1 \u2212 \u03c61)\u03b7M) \u2212 c) +w(1 \u2212\u03c7M)(1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03b7M ,\nwhich reduces to (1\u2212\u03c60)(\u03c61w\u2212c) \u03c61\u2212\u03c60 (i.e., the group\u2019s potential, p, drops out of the equation). Therefore the MSE payoff to the worker is independent of the worker\u2019s group identity or the presence or absence of the box.\n33Note that, conditional on W and E playing the MSE, W is indifferent about his or her cost of becoming qualified, c. This is because, in our setting, a worker with low costs of qualification is essentially choosing whether to \u201cact like he or she must have a low cost of qualification\u201d (q = 1) or \u201cact like he or she might have had a high cost of qualification\u201d (q = 0). The worker has a strict preference in equilibrium for a low cost of qualification only in an FQE.\nFinally, in any FQE with conservative hiring an unqualified worker receives a payoff of zero and a qualified worker receives a payoff of \u03c61w \u2212 cL. In this case expected payoffs again are independent of group identity.\nProposition 2 If the test is positively informative (\u03c61 \u2265 cL w > \u03c60), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is low (p < p \u2217 E), then W and E have opposed preferences over the box: E prefers that the box be present, W prefers that the box be banned.\nProof : When p < p\u2217 E then banning the box will generate an FQE with conservative hiring of all individuals. By Lemma 1 we know that W always prefers the MSE to the FQE with conservative hiring. By the supposition that \u03c61w\u2212cL > 0 and \u03c60 < \u03c61 \u2264 1, this follows from the fact that\n(1 \u2212 \u03c60)(\u03c61w \u2212 cL) \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60 \u2265 \u03c61w \u2212 cL > 0.\nAccordingly, both high and low-cost workers prefer the MSE, implying that workers in group 1 are made strictly worse off with the box, and workers in group 2 are indifferent about the box\u2019s presence.\nThe employer\u2019s payoff is affected by BTB solely through the change induced in group 1\u2019s qualification strategy behavior by BTB, because E was previously at a conservative hiring FQE with group 2 when the box was present. With the box, E received an expected payoff from hiring from group 1 equal to:\np1((B \u2212w)\u03c7M(\u03c61 + (1 \u2212 \u03c61)\u03b7M) \u2212w(1 \u2212 \u03c7M)(1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03b7M) \u2212w(1 \u2212 p1)(1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03b7M .\nThis can be reduced to\nEUE(MSE\u2223g = 1) = (1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03c61(B \u2212w)w B(1 \u2212 \u03c61) +w(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60) . (14)\nAt the FQE, E\u2019s expected payoff from hiring from group 1 is\nEUE(FQE, \u03b7\u2217 = 0\u2223g = 1) = p1(\u03c61)(B \u2212w).\nComparing these two payoffs we get that:\nEUE(FQE, \u03b7\u2217 = 0\u2223g = 1) \u2265 EUE(MSE\u2223g = 1)\nwhen\n\u03c61(B \u2212w)(p1 \u2212 w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) B(1 \u2212 \u03c61) +w(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60)) \u2265 0,\nor \u03c61(B \u2212w) (p1 \u2212 p\u2217E) \u2265 0. Since we have supposed that p1 > p\u2217E, this inequality always holds. Therefore E receives a weakly higher payoff (strictly higher if p1 > p\u2217E) from banning the box in this case.\nProposition 3 If the test is positively informative (\u03c61 \u2265 cL w > \u03c60), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is high (p > p \u2217 E), then BTB is Pareto dominant, strictly benefiting E and group 2 workers, and leaving the payoffs of group 1 workers unchanged.\nProof : Note that workers from group 1 are indifferent about banning the box when p > p\u2217E. First E\u2019s mixed equilibrium strategy, \u03b7M , is unchanged regardless of whether the box is present or not. Second, with or without the box, workers in the advantaged group play an\nMSE with E. We demonstrate the result by considering each groups of workers in turn, followed by the employer.\nWORKERS IN THE ADVANTAGED GROUP. The equilibrium probability that a low-cost worker becomes qualified when the box is banned, \u03c7M(p), is higher than it is for workers from group 1 when the box is present. This is because the population\u2019s potential, p, is less than p1 and therefore these workers must become qualified at a higher rate in order to keep E indifferent in the absence of the box when considering whether to hire a worker who received a test score of \u03b8 = 2. However, this higher rate of qualification by workers from group 1 has no effect on their equilibrium expected payoffs because these workers are indifferent between qualification and no qualification in equilibrium regardless of the box\u2019s presence:\nEUW (MSE \u2223 g = 1) = p1 \u22c5 (\u03c7M(p)(\u03c61w + (1 \u2212 \u03c61)\u03b7M \u2212 cL) + (1 \u2212 \u03c7M(p))(1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03b7Mw) +(1 \u2212 p1)(1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03b7Mw,\n= p1 \u22c5 ((1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03b7Mw) + (1 \u2212 p1)(1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03b7Mw, = (1 \u2212 \u03c60)\u03b7Mw.\nWORKERS IN THE DISADVANTAGED GROUP. Turning to workers in group 2, Lemma 1 implies that both low-and high-cost workers in group 2 receive a strictly higher payoff in the MSE. This is the Pareto efficient equilibrium if the box is banned, implying that workers from group 2 strictly benefit from banning the box.\nTHE EMPLOYER. The employer strictly prefers to ban the box in this setting. His or\nher payoff from banning the box in the MSE is equivalent to his or her payoff from the workers that send \u03b8 = 3; this is because for E to mix conditional on \u03b8 = 2, E must be receiving an expected payoff of zero conditional on \u03b8 = 2. Consequently, E\u2019s expected payoff with the box banned is\nEUE(MSE) = (B \u2212w) (\u03b3p1\u03c7M(p)\u03c61 + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)p2\u03c7M(p)\u03c61) , = (B \u2212w) \u22c5 p \u22c5 \u03c7M(p)\u03c61, = (B \u2212w)\u03c61p\u2217E.\nIn the presence of the box, the employer\u2019s expected payoff in the Pareto efficient equilibrium in this case is\nEUE(FQE) = (B \u2212w) (\u03b3p1\u03c7M(p1)\u03c61 + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)p2\u03c61) , = (B \u2212w)(\u03b3p1 w(1 \u2212 \u03c60)\np1(B(1 \u2212 \u03c61) +w(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c60))\u03c61 + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)p2\u03c61) , = (B \u2212w)\u03c61 (\u03b3p\u2217E + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)p2) .\nAccordingly, by the supposition that p2 < p\u2217E , it follows that \u03b3p \u2217 E + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)p2 < p\u2217E , implying that EUE(MSE) > EUE(FQE), so that E strictly benefits from BTB. Thus, relative to the expected payoff from the Pareto efficient equilibrium with the box present, the expected payoff from the Pareto efficient equilibrium with BTB is\n1. identical for workers from the advantaged group,\n2. strictly higher for workers from the disadvantaged group, and\n3. strictly higher for the employer.\nAccordingly, BTB is Pareto dominant in this case, as was to be shown.\nProposition 4 When the test is negatively informative (\u03c60 > cL w > \u03c61), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is low (p < p \u2217 E ), BTB is Pareto inefficient. Proof : When p < p\u2217E, the inequality in Equation 5 fails to hold and \u03b7 \u2217(\u2205) = 0; E hires conservatively from the group at large. As Inequality 6 doesn\u2019t hold when cL w > \u03c61, it follows that \u03c7\u2217(1) = \u03c7\u2217(2) = 0 and the effect of banning the box is to shut the labor market down entirely. No worker obtains qualification, and no worker is hired. This leaves payoffs for workers in group 2 unchanged. E and workers in group 1 are strictly worse off than they were with the box. As described above, with the box both E and workers from group 1 received a strictly positive expected payoff.\nProposition 5 When the test is negatively informative (\u03c60 > cL w > \u03c61), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is high (p \u2265 p \u2217 E), BTB strictly benefits group 2 workers and leaves the payoffs of group 1 workers unchanged.\nProof : By satisfaction of Equation 5, E hires aggressively from the group at large when p \u2265 p\u2217 E . And by satisfaction of Equation 8, all workers obtain qualification and an FQE exists with \u03b7\u2217(\u2205) = \u03c7\u2217(1) = \u03c7\u2217(2) = 1. The payoff to members of group 1 at this equilibrium is identical to their payoff when the box was present. However every member of group 2 is strictly better off in expectation. With the box, all members of group 2 received a payoff\nof zero. Without the box, high cost individuals in group 2 receive an expected payoff of w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) > 0 and low-cost individuals receive a payoff of w \u2212 cL > 0.\nProposition 6 When the test is negatively informative (\u03c60 > cL w > \u03c61), the groups are statistically distinct (p1 \u2265 p\u2217E > p2), and population potential is high (p \u2265 p \u2217 E), BTB is Pareto dominant if\np2 \u2208 [w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) B \u2212w\u03c60 , p\u2217E) ,\nand E is hurt by BTB if\np2 < w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) B \u2212w\u03c60 .\nProof : Banning the box strictly benefits E when E\u2019s expected payoff from hiring members of group 2 aggressively is positive, but when it is not sequentially rational for E to hire group 2 aggressively. This implies that p\u2217E > p2 but\n(B \u2212w) \u2212w(1 \u2212 p2)(1 \u2212 \u03c60) \u2265 0.\nThis latter inequality is satisfied when\np2 \u2265 w(1 \u2212 \u03c60) B \u2212w\u03c60 . (15)\nThus, when p2 \u2208 [w(1\u2212\u03c60)B\u2212w\u03c60 , p\u2217E) banning the box Pareto dominates the box, leaving members of group 2 strictly better off; members of group 1 indifferent; and E weakly better off. When p2 < w(1\u2212\u03c60) B\u2212w\u03c60 E is strictly made worse off by the box, as E\u2019s receives a negative payoff from hiring from group 2."
