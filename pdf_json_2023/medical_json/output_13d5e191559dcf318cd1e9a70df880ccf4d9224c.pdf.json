    "abstractText": "Introduction Appendicolithiasis is a risk factor for perforated acute appendicitis. There is limited inpatient data on predictors of progression in appendicolithiasis-associated non-perforated acute appendicitis. Methods We identified adults presenting with appendicolithiasis-associated non-perforated acute appendicitis (on computed tomography) who underwent appendectomy. Logistic regression was used to investigate predictors of inhospital perforation (on histopathology). Results 296 patients with appendicolithiasis-associated non-perforated acute appendicitis were identified; 48 (16.2%) had perforation on histopathology. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 39 (14.9) years. The mean (SD) length of stay (LOS) was 1.5 (1.8) days. LOS was significantly longer with perforated (mean [SD]: 3.0 [3.1] days) vs. non-perforated (mean [SD]: 1.2 [1.2] days) appendicitis (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, in-hospital perforation was associated with age > 65 years (OR 5.4, 95% CI: 1.422.2; p = 0.015), BMI > 30 kg/m2 (OR 3.5, 95% CI: 1.3\u20138.9; p = 0.011), hyponatremia (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3\u20139.8; p = 0.012). There was no significant association with age 25\u201365 years, gender, race, steroids, time-tosurgery, neutrophil percentage, or leukocyte count. Conclusion Geriatric age, obesity, and hyponatremia are associated with progression to perforation in appendicolithiasis-associated non-perforated acute appendicitis.",

Evidence suggests that factors associated with perforated appendicitis include male gender, advanced age, appendicolithiasis and presence of medical comorbidities [2, 3]. Interestingly, within the appendicolithiasis associated non-perforated appendicitis subgroup, there is a paucity of data regarding factors associated with the development of appendiceal perforation.\nWe aimed to investigate factors associated with the development of perforated appendicitis in patients who presented to our institution with non-perforated appendicitis and appendicolith on initial computed tomography."

Out of the 296 patients, 48 patients (16.2%) were found to have perforated appendicitis on histopathology. Participant demographic and baseline data are displayed in Table\u00a01. This was a predominantly young patient cohort with limited health comorbidities. The mean (SD) age for patients was 39 (14.9) years. The majority of patients were male (n = 172; 58.1%) and white race (n = 198; 66.9%). The patient population had a low prevalence of hypertension (n = 17, 5.7%) and diabetes mellitus (n = 9, 3.0%). Mean (SD) BMI for study participants was 24.7 (4.4) kg/m2. Two percent of (n = 6) participants were on steroids at the time of presentation.\nTable\u00a0 2 details preoperative and postoperative findings for the study population. Of note, one- third (n = 9) of hyponatremic patients at presentation (n = 27) were\nfound to have perforated appendicitis on histopathology. The mean (SD) time to the operating room was 12.1 (6.2) hours. The mean (SD) length of hospital stay for study participants was 1.5 (1.8) days. Mean (SD) length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the perforated acute appendicitis (3.0, 3.1\u00a0 days) group as compared to non- perforated (1.2, 1.2\u00a0 days) acute appendicitis participants (p < 0.001).\nOn univariate analyses, factors associated with perforated acute appendicitis included age > 65\u00a0 years versus 18\u201325\u00a0 years (OR 4.12; 95% CI: 1.36\u201412.48), hypertension (OR: 3.08; 95% CI: 1.01\u20148.56),BMI > 30\u00a0 kg/ m2 (OR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.22\u20146.04), and hyponatremia at presentation (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.19\u20146.90).

            "text": "Our results show that 16.2% of participants had in-hospital progression to perforation, an estimate which has never been reported previously. Further, our study shows that in patients with appendicolithiasis and non-perforated appendicitis on initial imaging, patient factors, such as geriatric age and obesity are significantly associated with in-hospital appendiceal perforation. Laboratory finding of hyponatremia is also predictive of in-hospital perforation.\nAppendicolithiasis has been reported to be found in 38.7% of patients with acute appendicitis [7]. Moreover, appendicolithiasis is associated with a higher rate of appendiceal rupture/abscess formation and a higher failure rate of conservative management with antibiotics [8]. Malinen et\u00a0al. investigated the histopathological features of acute appendicitis with and without appendicolithiasis and found signs of severe acute inflammation in ~ 50% of patients with an appendicolith vs only ~ 15% of those without appendicolith. Micro-abscesses formation and epithelial damage were twofold in the appendicolith group [8\u201310]. However, factors contributing to this progression in this sub-population are poorly understood. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating factors associated with in-hospital progression to perforation in patients with non- perforated appendicolithiasis-associated acute appendicitis at presentation. It is noteworthy that our results are largely consistent with previous data on factors associated with appendiceal perforation. For instance, Walker et\u00a0al. showed that in general geriatric patients had a higher risk of perforation (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02\u20131.05).\nWhile time to appendectomy has previously been shown to be associated with appendiceal perforation, our study did not find a significant association. This is possibly a result of the fact that most patients in our study underwent an appendectomy within 24\u00a0h of presentation. Further, it is also possible that our study was underpowered to detect this association.\nIt has been suggested in literature that hyponatremia at presentation is indicative of perforation rather than being an early predictor of impending perforation. Thus, it can be argued that the 27 patients with hyponatremia at presentation in our study population already\nhad perforated appendicitis at the time of presentation and the perforation was missed on computed tomography due to limited sensitivity. However, histopathological examination showed perforation in only one-third (n = 9) of these patients. Further, our sensitivity analysis after excluding hyponatremic patients did not change our final results; geriatric age and obesity were still significantly associated with in-hospital progression to perforation.\nDiagnostic imaging modalities for diagnosis of acute appendicitis include ultrasonography, MRI or CT. CT imaging has a sensitivity of ~ 90% in comparison to MRI which has a sensitivity of ~ 97% in diagnosing acute appendicitis [11]. However, the radiologic diagnosis of complicated appendicitis is more challenging. A meta-analysis of CT features for differentiating complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis found ten CT features for differentiating complicated appendicitis, nine of which showed high specificity, and one of which was highly sensitive [12].\nThe major limitations of our study include its retrospective, observational design with its inherent biases. The sensitivity of computed tomography in detecting perforation (at the time of initial presentation) is variable, and especially dependent upon the interpreter; thus some of the participants with perforation on histopathology may have already had perforated appendicitis at the time of initial imaging. Further, due to the limited number of patients with perforation on histopathology, our study might be underpowered to detect certain associations, such as that with time to operating room or steroid use. Due to absence of information, we were unable to assess the utility of other biochemical markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperbilirubinemia and hyperfibrinogenemia, in predicting appendiceal perforation in our population [13\u201316]."

Perforation increases risk of postoperative adverse outcomes including increased hospital length of stay. Factors associated with in-hospital perforation include geriatric age, obesity, and hyponatremia.\nAcknowledgements N/a.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions KC, JH, and JB collected data.
