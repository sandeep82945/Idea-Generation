    "abstractText": "Background: Efficacious mental health interventions for sexual and gender minority youth have had limited reach, given their delivery as time-intensive, in-person sessions. Internet-based interventions may facilitate reach to sexual and gender minority youth; however, there is little research examining their efficacy. Objective: This study aims to describe the results of a pilot randomized controlled trial of imi, a web application designed to improve mental health by supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority identity affirmation, coping self-efficacy, and coping skill practice. Methods: Sexual and gender minority youth (N=270) aged 13 to 19 (mean 16.5, SD 1.5) years and living in the United States were recruited through Instagram advertisements. Approximately 78% (210/270) of the sample identified as racial or ethnic minorities. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the full imi intervention web application (treatment; 135/270, 50%) or a resource page\u2013only version of the imi site (control; 135/270, 50%). The imi application covered four topical areas: gender identity; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority identity; stress and coping; and internalized homophobia and transphobia. Participants explored these areas by engaging with informational resources, exercises, and peer stories at a self-guided pace. Both arms were assessed via web-based surveys at baseline and 4-week follow-up for intervention satisfaction, stress appraisals (ie, challenge, threat, and resource), coping skills (ie, instrumental support, positive reframing, and planning), and mental health symptoms among other outcomes. Main intent-to-treat analyses compared the arms at week 4, controlling for baseline values on each outcome. Results: Survey retention was 90.4% (244/270) at week 4. Participants in the treatment arm reported greater satisfaction with the intervention than participants in the control arm (t241=\u20132.98; P=.003). The treatment arm showed significantly greater improvement in challenge appraisals (ie, belief in one\u2019s coping abilities) than the control (Cohen d=0.26; P=.008). There were no differences between the arms for threat (d=0.10; P=.37) or resource (d=0.15; P=.14) appraisals. The treatment arm showed greater increases in coping skills than the control arm (instrumental support: d=0.24, P=.005; positive reframing: d=0.27, P=.02; planning: d=0.26, P=.02). Mental health symptoms improved across both the treatment and control arms; however, there were no differences between arms. Within the treatment arm, higher engagement with imi (\u22655 sessions, >10 minutes, or >10 pages) predicted greater improvement in stress appraisals (all P values <.05).

Internet-based interventions may facilitate reach to sexual and gender minority youth; however, there is little research examining their efficacy.\nObjective: This study aims to describe the results of a pilot randomized controlled trial of imi, a web application designed to improve mental health by supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority identity affirmation, coping self-efficacy, and coping skill practice.\nMethods: Sexual and gender minority youth (N=270) aged 13 to 19 (mean 16.5, SD 1.5) years and living in the United States were recruited through Instagram advertisements. Approximately 78% (210/270) of the sample identified as racial or ethnic minorities. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the full imi intervention web application (treatment; 135/270, 50%) or a resource page\u2013only version of the imi site (control; 135/270, 50%). The imi application covered four topical areas: gender identity; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority identity; stress and coping; and internalized homophobia and transphobia. Participants explored these areas by engaging with informational resources, exercises, and peer stories at a self-guided pace. Both arms were assessed via web-based surveys at baseline and 4-week follow-up for intervention satisfaction, stress appraisals (ie, challenge, threat, and resource), coping skills (ie, instrumental support, positive reframing, and planning), and mental health symptoms among other outcomes. Main intent-to-treat analyses compared the arms at week 4, controlling for baseline values on each outcome.\nResults: Survey retention was 90.4% (244/270) at week 4. Participants in the treatment arm reported greater satisfaction with the intervention than participants in the control arm (t241=\u20132.98; P=.003). The treatment arm showed significantly greater improvement in challenge appraisals (ie, belief in one\u2019s coping abilities) than the control (Cohen d=0.26; P=.008). There were no differences between the arms for threat (d=0.10; P=.37) or resource (d=0.15; P=.14) appraisals. The treatment arm showed greater increases in coping skills than the control arm (instrumental support: d=0.24, P=.005; positive reframing: d=0.27, P=.02; planning: d=0.26, P=.02). Mental health symptoms improved across both the treatment and control arms; however, there were no differences between arms. Within the treatment arm, higher engagement with imi (\u22655 sessions, >10 minutes, or >10 pages) predicted greater improvement in stress appraisals (all P values <.05).\nJ Med Internet Res 2022 | vol. 24 | iss. 8 | e39094 | p. 1https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e39094 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nConclusions: The results provide initial evidence that asynchronous psychosocial interventions delivered via a web application to sexual and gender minority youth can support their ability to cope with minority stress.

            "text": "Compared with their cisgender, heterosexual peers, sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth are at increased risk of experiencing a wide variety of negative mental health outcomes [1]. In a recent national surveillance survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 55% of gay, lesbian, or bisexual youth reported poor mental health during the prior 30 days. SGM youth were also twice as likely as their non\u2013SGM youth counterparts to report feeling sad or hopeless and nearly 3 times as likely to have considered attempting suicide [2]. These disparities may vary further by race and ethnicity. A 2021 national survey of SGM youth (aged 13-24 years) in the United States sponsored by the Trevor Project found that racial and ethnic minority SGM youth were more likely than White non-Hispanic SGM youth to have seriously considered suicide in the prior year [3]. Taken together, these data underscore the need to address the well-being of diverse SGM youth populations through innovative mental health interventions [4].\nThe minority stress model [5,6] provides a framework for understanding the higher prevalence of psychological distress and negative mental health outcomes for SGM youth, as well as for identifying interventions to improve SGM individuals\u2019 mental health [7]. The minority stress theory proposes that SGM health disparities can be explained in large part by discrimination from a hostile homophobic and transphobic culture, which creates stressors unique to minority identity [8]. These stressors include harassment, victimization, internalized homophobia and transphobia, and expectations of rejection. These disparities may be further compounded if individuals experience multiple minority stressors because of having >1 minority identity (eg, discrimination because of sexuality, gender, racial, and ethnic identity) [9-12]. For instance, racial and ethnic minority SGM youth may experience sexual or gender minority stress within their racial and ethnic communities while also experiencing racial and ethnic minority stress within lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other SGM (LGBTQ+) communities.\nThe transactional model of stress and coping [13] notes that individuals\u2019 ability to respond to stress and reduce its impact on their well-being begins with an assessment of the stressor (ie, primary appraisal) and their confidence and ability to respond to the stressor (ie, secondary appraisal). Interventions designed to target and transform appraisals of stress from that of a threat to more of a challenge through cognitive and behavioral coping strategies have been shown to support the\nmental health and well-being of adolescents [14-16]. Efficacious mental health interventions for SGM youth have focused on providing resources that scaffold the ability of SGM youth to perceive minority stressors as a challenge to be faced and overcome rather than as a threat, including strengthening the coping skills of SGM youth, affirming SGM identities, and strengthening supportive social connections [17-19].\nAlthough prior research suggests that face-to-face interventions that include these components may improve the mental health of SGM youth [20], the reach and scalability of these programs have been challenging, given their time intensity and need for synchronous interactions, which have become increasingly difficult to coordinate amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [21,22]. At the same time, the need for scalable mental health resources has become particularly acute in recent years. For example, data from a large US survey of teenagers conducted by Common Sense Media [23] indicated that the amount of time SGM youth spent searching for mental health information on the web substantially increased during the pandemic.\nIn recent years, technology-assisted interventions have been posited to help decrease implementation challenges by serving as supplemental strategies to face-to-face psychotherapy. For example, Lucassen et al [24] found that their modular computer-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program was feasible, acceptable, and effective in their pilot study with 21 sexual minority adolescents, aged 13 and 19 years, in New Zealand. Other programs have sought to use web-based interventions to circumvent barriers to accessing affirming in-person services. For example, Craig et al [18] found that SGM youth in Canada (N=46; age 14-29 years) who participated in their 8-session, manualized, and synchronous pilot telehealth group intervention found the program to be acceptable. Although their design did not allow for randomization, preliminary efficacy analyses noted improvements in stress appraisals, cognitive and behavioral coping skills, and depressive symptomatology in the web-based group program when compared with youth in the wait-list control group. Taken together, these findings are promising and highlight technology\u2019s potential as a modality to deliver mental health interventions for SGM youth.\nTo date, there is limited research examining the efficacy of web-based platforms for helping SGM youth cope with minority stress asynchronously. For instance, in a pilot randomized trial, Schwinn et al [25] found that their tailored, 3-session web-based intervention resulted in decreases in perceived stress and increases in coping and problem-solving skills when compared\nJ Med Internet Res 2022 | vol. 24 | iss. 8 | e39094 | p. 2https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e39094 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nwith youth in the control arm at a 3-month follow-up. Egan et al [26] designed an innovative, web-accessible role-playing game intervention. Although they found high acceptability for their program among SGM youth participating in their randomized trial, they did not observe any improvements at the 1- or 2-month follow-up across coping skills, depression and anxiety symptoms, or knowledge and use of web resources."

            "text": "Although these findings suggest that SGM youth perceive web-based asynchronous interventions to be acceptable, there is a need to increase the empirical evidence base for the efficacy of these interventions [27]. Moreover, the generalizability of the aforementioned findings to racial and ethnic minority populations has been constrained, given the limited representation of these groups in prior research. Given the current state of the science, this study sought to test the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an asynchronous web application\u2014imi\u2014among a predominantly racial and ethnic minority sample of SGM youth aged between 13 and 19 years living in the United States. The imi application was designed to facilitate SGM identity affirmation, promote a sense of connectedness to the LGBTQ+ community, and encourage cognitive and behavioral coping skill practice. In partnership with a racially and ethnically diverse group of SGM youth, we co-designed the imi application to be directly responsive to their needs by leveraging the visual, aesthetic, and interactive capacities of a web-based interface to deliver identity-affirming experiences that could support the intervention\u2019s engagement and efficacy.\nOur study had 4 main objectives. First, we examined the acceptability of the imi application in a diverse sample of 270 SGM youth. Given our use of human-centered design principles and the involvement of SGM youth in the design of the imi application, we expected that participants randomized to receive the imi application would report greater acceptability and satisfaction than participants assigned to a resource-only version of the imi application (the control arm), which did not contain any of the newly created interactive coping and identity-affirming content designed with LGBTQ+ youth. Second, we examined the preliminary efficacy of the imi application as a digital tool for increasing adaptive stress appraisals among SGM youth (primary outcome). Given the imi application\u2019s focus on teaching cognitive and behavioral coping skills, we hypothesized that participants assigned to receive the imi application would be more likely to appraise stress as a surmountable challenge and less likely to appraise stress as threatening by the 4-week follow-up relative to the control arm. Third, we examined the preliminary efficacy of the imi application across five secondary outcomes related to the mental health of SGM youth: cognitive and behavioral coping skills, identity affirmation and connectedness to the LGBTQ+ community, internalization of blame for minority stress, sense of belonging, and anxiety and depression symptoms. We predicted that the imi application would be more likely to improve SGM youth\u2019s outcomes across these domains relative to the control arm. Finally, as exploratory analyses, we examined participants\u2019 engagement with the imi application relative to the control arm. We also explored whether participant\nengagement with the imi application (ie, counts of user sessions, time spent, and the number of pages visited) predicted improvement in primary and secondary outcomes."

If any significant inconsistencies were identified, applicants were emailed and asked to respond via email or phone to resolve the issue.\nOnce participants completed the baseline survey and passed the verification procedure, they were considered to be enrolled in the study. Enrolled participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the imi (treatment; received full intervention content) or asterix (control; received pared-down resources-only version of the imi application) arm. Within 1 business day of completing the baseline survey, each participant was emailed a unique link to the imi or asterix web application. Participants were compensated with a US $30 Amazon e-gift card once they registered for an account on imi or asterix. The informed consent form encouraged participants to log into their digital resource at least twice a week and informed them that the study team would be able to track where they went within the web application, what features they used, what content they saw, and the duration of time they spent on the web application. Depending on their communication preferences, participants were emailed or texted every 7 days after enrollment to remind them to use the web application. On day 28, participants were sent a link to the follow-up survey, which they had 14 days to complete. Once completed, they received a US $40 Amazon e-gift card. Authors were not blind to participants\u2019 conditions during data collection or analysis; however, as all intervention\nactivities were self-guided and all outcome measures were self-assessed by participants, there was no interaction between study staff and participants that could have led to response biases on the part of participants because of demand characteristics.

This included extracting evidence-based exercises from the literature to support key psychosocial targets (eg, cognitive and behavioral coping skills and identity affirmation) that could be adapted to a digital platform and prototyping digital \u201cmini-interventions\u201d that would be further developed in the final imi application content.\nJ Med Internet Res 2022 | vol. 24 | iss. 8 | e39094 | p. 4https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e39094 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX"

            "text": "imi is a web application designed to facilitate LGBTQ+ identity affirmation, promote a feeling of connectedness to the LGBTQ+ community, and encourage cognitive and behavioral coping skill practice (Multimedia Appendix 2). The name imi (pronounced eye-me) is a nod to the idea that no matter who you are, you are you (ie, \u201cI\u2019m me\u201d). The logo, designed as an ambigram that can be read in many orientations, represents the belief that even as one changes and evolves, they are exactly as they are. The imi application delivers fully automated information and skill practice across guides covering four content areas: (1) gender identity exploration (the gender guide), (2) sexual orientation and broader LGBTQ+ identity exploration (the queerness guide), (3) stress and coping (the stress guide), and (4) internalized homophobia and transphobia (the stigma guide). Examples of each guide\u2019s goals and sample activities are as follows:\n1. The gender guide allows youth to explore and affirm their gender identity and expression. For example, one activity uses a chat interface that allows users to experiment with different names and pronouns that fit their gender identity. 2. The queerness guide encourages youth to examine their LGBTQ+ identity through an intersectional lens and reflect upon what queerness means to them. For instance, one activity provides examples of the ways other LGBTQ+ youth define their queerness and guides the user through the creation of their own definition. 3. The stress guide provides psychoeducation on LGBTQ+ sources of minority stress (eg, discrimination, prejudice, and microaggressions) and teaches cognitive and behavioral coping skills through activities such as guided breathing, positive reframing exercises, and social support resources. Users are encouraged to select coping skills that work for them most effectively. 4. The stigma guide explains how negative and stereotypical messages become internalized and encourages users to examine and challenge their own internalized homophobia\nJ Med Internet Res 2022 | vol. 24 | iss. 8 | e39094 | p. 5https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e39094 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nand transphobia. For example, one activity scaffolds users in developing a personalized affirmation to help them combat negative self-talk.\nEach of the four guides comprises four types of content: (1) learning segments, (2) activities, (3) community content, and (4) external resources. Learning segments provide information about LGBTQ+ relevant vocabulary (eg, pronouns and commonly used terms for sexual and gender identity), queer history, and psychoeducation on minority stress and internalized stigma. Activities include interactive exercises, such as chat interfaces, drawing activities, and guided relaxation and mindfulness practices. Community content includes video, audio, and written stories and images of LGBTQ+ youth. External resources connect youth to externally linked content designed for LGBTQ+ youth, such as the Trevor Project and the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network\u2019s coming out guides."

The resource section also contains safer browsing tips, which provide web-based privacy and safety advice specific to LGBTQ+ youth.\nThe control arm only received access to the resource webpages described previously and did not have access to any of the other content in the imi application. This pared-down, resources-only version of the imi site that was provided to the control group was named asterix This control allowed for a test of whether the learning, interactive, and community content of imi guides had benefits above and beyond any benefit that might be derived from simply having a curated, unified access point for existing, freely available web-based resources for SGM youth.\nParticipants in both arms were instructed to try to visit their respective web applications at least twice a week during the 4-week active trial period but could engage with the content available to them however they wished, in any order, at their discretion. On the basis of their preferences, participants received either weekly texts or emails reminding them to log into their web application."

These paradata were transformed to characterize the amount, frequency, duration, and depth of engagement with the web-based intervention [41].\nIn this study, we derived four paradata metrics: (1) counts of user sessions, (2) time spent on each intervention, (3) the number of pages visited, and (4) external links clicked. Sessions were\ncounted whenever there was a period of activity within the app, with a participant having the same session ID until they had a period of \u226515 minutes or more of inactivity with the application. We derived the variable number of sessions by counting the number of discrete sessions in which the participant engaged during the 4-week active trial period.\nTo measure time spent on the intervention, we tracked the number of minutes and seconds participants spent logged into their respective web resources during the active trial period. Each time a participant visited a page within the app, there was a record of their activity. We derived the variable number of unique pages viewed by summing the number of distinct pages a participant visited during the active trial period. Finally, each time a participant clicked on a link, a unique record of the click was generated. We summed the number of unique external links a participant clicked on during the active trial period to derive this value."

Of note, treating the nonnormal data as continuous (with and without transformation of these data) yielded similar results.\nFinally, we explored whether reaching these thresholds of use within the imi arm predicted differential gains across primary and secondary outcomes. We focused these analyses on three indicators capturing participants\u2019 engagement within imi: time spent on site, number of sessions completed, and number of pages viewed, which captured the depth of participant engagement with that content which was unique to the treatment arm. We ran separate regression models because of the high multicollinearity among engagement metrics and the importance of examining the different scopes of paradata (eg, the amount, frequency, duration, and depth of engagement).

            "text": "Digital interventions show promise in supporting the mental health of SGM youth, given the appeal of the modality, their suitability to deliver engaging asynchronous content, and their unique capacity to reach large numbers of SGM youth, including youth who may be unable to access in-person services because of transportation concerns, availability of local services, or concerns about privacy and stigma. In this study, we found high acceptability for both the full imi intervention web application and the resource page\u2013only control, with participants reporting greater satisfaction and engagement with the imi web application. SGM youth assigned to the imi web application also had greater improvements in stress appraisals and coping skills. Given the potential for digital interventions such as the imi application to support the mental health needs of SGM youth, we discuss our findings in detail in the following sections and note opportunities to advance work in this area.\nParticipants indicated that the imi application\u2019s content was acceptable and well-suited for SGM youth populations. Consistent with our hypothesis, participants randomly assigned to receive the imi application were more likely than those assigned to the resource-only control arm to report a positive experience with the intervention and to recommend it to SGM youth friends. These sentiments were echoed in the qualitative feedback, in which participants highlighted the benefits of viewing the stories of other SGM youth and learning approaches for coping with stress. Participants also offered several ways of improving the imi application, including developing greater breadth (eg, more overall content) and depth (eg, expansion to include a section focused on LGBTQ+ relationships) of content, and the addition of new features (eg, the ability to interact with other SGM youth through the web application). Collectively, these findings align with the growing body of evidence suggesting that SGM youth consider digital interventions to be acceptable modalities through which to receive mental health support [18,19,24]. They also point to concrete directions for intervention improvement.\nFor individuals to respond effectively against a stressor, they must be able to feel confident in their ability to address it [43]. Consistent with our hypothesis, SGM youth in the imi application arm were more likely than their peers in the control arm to appraise stressful situations as a surmountable challenge at the 4-week follow-up. The imi application arm was also less likely to report appraising stressful events as having lasting, negative repercussions. Participants in both study arms reported gains in having the internal and external resources to deal with\nstressful situations. The absence of a significant difference in resource appraisals between the 2 arms may be explained by the fact that both sites contained the same imi-based curated list of resources tailored to SGM youth. Taken together, these findings are promising and suggest that the imi application may help SGM youth situate stressors in their lives as transient and addressable, which, in turn, may reduce the acuity of these experiences on their mental health.\nWe also observed important initial changes in SGM youth\u2019s coping skills after the 4-week follow-up period. Compared with the control arm, participants in the imi application arm reported greater gains in their ability to seek out instrumental support, positively reframe challenging situations, and engage in planning as coping skills. Interestingly, we observed improvements in measured areas of mental health across both arms (eg, anxiety and depression symptoms), suggesting that web applications of varying scope tailored to SGM youth are promising sources of mental health support. Unfortunately, the absence of a no-treatment control group prevents us from inferring whether both interventions are efficacious relative to the absence of any program. Although comparing the full imi intervention with a resource-only subset of the imi website (ie, asterix) makes it harder to detect differences between the arms, we felt that withholding referrals to care for SGM youth would be unethical. We also selected this control as we wished to examine whether the full, interactive imi intervention provides benefits to SGM youth that go above and beyond what might be gained by being given access to a unified, vetted list of freely available existing resources. Previous studies suggest that SGM youth are increasingly and disproportionately searching for support on the web; however, this opens them to increased experiences of encountering homophobic and transphobic content and other hate speech [23]. It may be the case that gathering vetted resources in a single safe site designed specifically for them (ie, the resources section of the imi application) supports the well-being of SGM youth in and of itself. Although our design lacked a no-treatment control and, therefore, was unable to test this hypothesis, it does highlight the additive benefit of interactive identity affirmation and coping content contained in the full imi intervention; that is, although participants who were assigned both versions of the web application (the resource-only version of imi called asterix and the full interactive imi intervention) experienced decreased feelings of anxiety and depression after 4 weeks, only those given the full intervention experienced the additional benefit of greater stress appraisal and cognitive and behavioral coping skill improvements."

            "text": "The lack of observed differences between the arms across other domains (eg, identity affirmation and connectedness to the LGBTQ+ community, internalization of minority stress, and sense of belonging) may be related to several additional considerations. First, it is possible that the 4-week study period may be too short to allow for meaningful changes to emerge in certain types of outcomes. For example, it may be that identity-related shifts require more time to manifest. Second, consistent with participants\u2019 qualitative feedback, it is possible that SGM youth require a greater amount of content and\nJ Med Internet Res 2022 | vol. 24 | iss. 8 | e39094 | p. 16https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e39094 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nactivities in a web application to, for example, feel more connected to the broader LGBTQ+ community. Third, some participants noted in their qualitative recommendations that the imi application may be most useful for SGM youth who are earlier in the exploration and affirmation of their identities. However, it remains unclear whether the intervention\u2019s effects may be greater for SGM youth earlier in their coming out process or those questioning their identities, a question which this study was not statistically powered to address. Future research is needed to examine whether the intervention\u2019s effect on the outcomes requires greater content to be developed within the web application, whether the intervention effects are moderated by how comfortable users are with their identities, or whether a longer follow-up period may allow for changes in distal outcomes to be observed.\nParticipants\u2019 engagement with the web application also offers insights into its acceptability and preliminary efficacy. Most participants across both arms created an account on their assigned web application, with participants reporting a comparable number of log-ins over the 4-week follow-up period. As expected, participants in the imi application arm viewed more unique pages than participants in the control arm. In and of itself, this finding does not indicate greater engagement with the imi application, as the control web application contained only a small subset of pages from the imi application. Consistent with our hypothesis, participants in the imi application arm also spent more time logged into the intervention than their peers in the control arm. However, imi participants were less likely than their control counterparts to click on external links. When taken together, these findings may be explained by two alternate (but complementary) possibilities: imi participants may have been more likely to spend time on the web application and less likely to require clicking on external links as the created content and activities were engaging and sufficiently helpful. Alternatively, given the limited content available to SGM youth in the control arm, participants assigned to asterix may have spent their time reviewing the content offered through the links to curated LGBTQ+-affirming resources, a possibility we could not assess in this study as we could not track participants\u2019 behavior on external websites. Future research examining participants\u2019 experiences within and outside of the web application may be warranted.\nAs an exploratory analysis, we examined whether SGM youth\u2019s engagement with the imi application could affect the strength of the intervention\u2019s effect. Consistent with our hypothesis, and in alignment with prior research examining the role of engagement on a digital intervention\u2019s efficacy [41,44,45], higher engagement with the imi application (eg, \u226510 minutes spent on the tool; >10 unique pages viewed) was linked to greater improvement on our primary outcome variables. This finding supports the interpretation that engaging with the imi application\u2019s content improves coping abilities. On the basis of our engagement data, it is promising to see that more than half of the participants assigned to the full imi intervention achieved these thresholds. However, it is worthwhile noting that SGM youth were incentivized for creating an account within the tool and sent reminders by the study team to log back in over time. It remains crucial to understand whether these thresholds and\ntheir associated benefits persist outside of the clinical trial setting. Efforts to explore engagement in a naturalistic study may be worthwhile to examine and affirm external validity."

            "text": "Several limitations are worth noting. First, although the intervention effects moved in favor of the imi application arm in primary and secondary outcomes, our ability to detect these effects with statistical precision was limited by our small sample size and short follow-up period. Future scaled-up versions of the imi intervention with larger sample sizes, a longer duration, and a greater number of follow-up periods may be warranted to examine efficacy and effectiveness with greater precision. Second, some of the indicators used to measure our outcomes (eg, authenticity and LGBTQ+ community connectedness) were originally developed with adult populations. Given the unique needs of SGM youth, it is possible that the measures used in our study were not optimal for use with SGM youth populations. Future research examining the psychometric appropriateness of these measures with SGM youth populations may be warranted. Third, our ability to recruit youth from the lowest end of the age spectrum was somewhat limited. Only 11.1% (30/270) of the sample was aged 13 to 14 years. This is a common limitation in studies of SGM youth [46]. However, given the qualitative feedback that youth earlier in the journey of identity exploration may benefit more from the tool, future implementation research should explore pathways for making the tool more accessible to both younger youth and youth who may be in the earlier stages of identity exploration or questioning their identities. Similarly, although the diversity of race and ethnicities, as well as sexual and gender identities represented in our sample, is a strength, this initial pilot study was not powered to assess whether the intervention has differential efficacy based on these demographic characteristics. Finally, we weighed the advantages and disadvantages of enforcing a type I error (ie, false positive) correction relative to a type II error (ie, false negative). Given the exploratory nature of our trial and the small sample size of this pilot study, we did not include a family-wise error rate correction, which is justified in early exploration [47]. Future research examining the effects of both the imi and asterix applications with larger and population-representative samples may be warranted.\nOur study also has several strengths worth emphasizing. First, it is one of the few clinical trials examining how to design and deliver a coping intervention that may reduce the negative effects of minority stress on SGM youth. Second, compared with face-to-face programs for SGM youth and synchronous digital interventions, our findings underscore the feasibility and acceptability of an asynchronous digital intervention that overcomes access and engagement barriers by being freely accessible on demand, scalable, confidential, and not requiring a significant time commitment. Our study demonstrated that a brief (as little as 10 minutes), self-guided intervention may have significant benefits for coping with stress. Finally, compared with prior trials, our study increases the likelihood that the findings are generalizable, given our commitment to recruiting and retaining a diverse group of SGM youth across races, ethnicities, sexual orientations and gender identities, geographies, and socioeconomic backgrounds.\nJ Med Internet Res 2022 | vol. 24 | iss. 8 | e39094 | p. 17https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e39094 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX"

            "text": "This study demonstrated that a brief web-based intervention can provide self-guided, asynchronous, and confidential support that improves the ability of SGM youth to cope with minority stress. As a tool, the imi application may provide public health utility and value by expanding the reach and scalability of mental health programs, particularly for SGM youth who may be unable to participate in time-intensive, synchronous interactions. It may also serve as an ancillary tool for community-based agencies seeking to engage their SGM youth clients via the internet. Further research is needed to examine the long-term effects of the imi application and its potential for scalability and population health impact."
