1. **Investigate the impact of different delegation rules on the principal's payoff.** The paper assumes that the principal can condition the delegation decision on the realization of the public signal. However, one could also consider models in which the principal must commit to delegation or direct action before observing the public signal.
2. **Extend the model to allow for multiple agents with different preferences and information structures.** This would allow for a more realistic analysis of human-machine collaborations, in which multiple humans and algorithms may be involved in the decision-making process.
3. **Consider the case where the agent's preferences are not common knowledge.** This would introduce an additional layer of uncertainty into the model and make the principal's decision-making problem more challenging.
4. **Develop a dynamic model of human-machine collaboration.** This would allow for the study of how the principal's and agent's strategies evolve over time as they learn more about each other's preferences and information structures.
5. **Apply the model to a specific real-world application.** This would provide a concrete example of how the model can be used to improve the design of human-machine collaborations.
