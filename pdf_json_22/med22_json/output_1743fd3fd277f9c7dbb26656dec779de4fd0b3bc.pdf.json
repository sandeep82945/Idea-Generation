    "abstractText": "A load-bearing matrix filled with biologically active compounds is an efficient method for transporting them to the target location. Bee-made propolis has long been known as a natural product with antibacterial and antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antifungal properties, and anti-oxidative activity. The aim of the research is to obtain stable propolis/PVA solutions and produce fibers by electrospinning. To increase propolis content in fibers as much as possible, various types of propolis extracts were used. As a result of the research, microand nano-fiber webs were obtained, the possible use of which have biomedical and bioprotective applications. All used materials are edible and safe for humans, and fiber webs were prepared without using any toxic agent. This strategy overcomes propolis processing problems due to limitations to its solubility. The integration of different combinations of extracts allows more than 73 wt% of propolis to be incorporated into the fibers. The spinning solution preparation method was adapted to each type of propolis, and by combining the methods, solutions with different propolis extracts were obtained. Firstly, the total content of flavonoids in the propolis extracts was determined for the assessment and prediction of bioactivity. The properties of the extracts relevant for the preparation of electrospinning solutions were also evaluated. Secondly, the most appropriate choice of PVA molecular weight was made in order not to subject the propolis to too high temperatures (to save resources and not reduce the bioactivity of propolis) during the solution preparation process and to obtain fibers with the smallest possible diameter (for larger surface-to-volume ratios of nanofibers and high porosity). Third, electrospinning solutions were evaluated (viscosity, pH, conductivity and density, shelf life) before and after the addition of propolis to predict the maximum propolis content in the fibers and spinning stability. Each solution combination was spun using a cylindrical type electrode (suitable for industrial production) and tested for a stable electrospinning process. Using adapted solution-mixing sequences, all the obtained solutions were spun stably, and homogeneous fibers were obtained without major defects.",

Introduction\nPropolis is a natural material produced by honey bees with antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal properties and antioxidant activity [1\u20133]. Its composition may vary depending on the region of harvest. Aromatic compounds, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds are the main chemical classes present in propolis [4]. Brazil\u2019s green propolis is currently highly valued for its composition (rich in Artepillin C), and brown and red propolis also has great biological potential [1,5]. The solubility and efficacy of propolis against microorganisms depend on the solvent used. Alcohol extracts contain the highest content of flavonoids, but propolis is also soluble in glycerin and polyethylene glycol and\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2311. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27072311 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2311 2 of 15\npartly soluble in water and other substances. Higher levels of flavonoids predict higher efficacy against microorganisms [6], but the overall combination of components is also important. Propolis is commonly used for the treatment of inflammatory dermal diseases and also shows wound-healing activity [7,8]. Therefore, it is very important to find the best way to add it in order to ensure it effective treatment properties. Electrospun nanofiber webs are extensively studied in this regard; unlike films, they have a high surface area and porosity, which provide a wide range of applications, including in medical treatments. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has an easy process ability and is used as a base material. The quality of electrospun solutions is a key factor in ensuring a stable spinning process and high-quality fibers. To ensure spin ability, it is important to evaluate the viscosity, electrical conductivity, and pH of the solutions. The processability of PVA spinning solution depends firstly on the concentration and secondly on the molecular weight of the polymer. The upper limit of the PVA concentration is highly dependent on the viscosity of the spun solution [9]. Various substances can be incorporated into PVA fibers, and high loading capacity of drugs and other additives can expand their use. There are currently no publications on pure electrospun propolis nanofibers, but there are several studies [7,10\u201314] that reflect propolis integration methods in electrospinning solutions incorporated into the fibers or coated on their surface. The following methods have been reported for the integration of propolis in electrospun nanofibers containing PVA:\n\u2022 Previous solubilization of propolis extract in water/ethanol mixtures [7] showed that propolis does not dissolve and no fibers are formed; \u2022 Preparation of 10\u201315% PVA solution in mixtures of water/ethanol [7] ensured that propolis dissolves and fibers with various morphology were formed, some of them also with defects; \u2022 Usage of polyethylene glycol (1\u20132%) as a solvent to solubilize propolis extract, being further added to the PVA solution [7], allowed propolis to dissolve and the allowed the formation of fibers from the solution; \u2022 Preparation of propolis nanoparticles, which were then added to the polymeric solution of PVA [7], led to the successful formation of fibers; \u2022 PVA was used as a supportive material to accumulate propolis in scaffold, and then electrospun Propolis/PVA scaffolds were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde [10]; \u2022 Previous ethanol solubilized propolis solutions (3\u201320%) were added to the PVA (5\u201324%) solution [11\u201314], fibers were formed with various morphologies, most of them without defects.\nA number of studies [15\u201317] have shown that propolis ethanol extract containing electrospun PVA fibers have antibacterial activity against S. aureus (3 wt% propolis was added directly into PVA/gelatin patch) [15] (40 wt% of propolis added into spinning solution), low activity against P. aeruginosa [16], and antiviral activity (fibers containing 5 wt% propolis extract and cross-linked carboxymethyl starch) [17]. In view of relatively low propolis concentrations in the studies examined above, the purpose of this study was to incorporate as much propolis as possible into the fiber composition to achieve material properties that are important for biomedical and bioprotective applications. In order for the resulting solutions to be used in industrial production, it is important to evaluate their shelf life and stability. It is also important to use solutions that are suitable for electrospinning on an industrial scale. Multicomponent electrospinning solutions rapidly lose their homogeneity; therefore, a roller-type needleless electrospinning machine was used in the study to ensure that the solution is stirred even during spinning. Electrospinning is a simple and effective way to make nanofibers. Several methods for electrospinning nanofibers on a large scale are available. The shortcomings of jet instability and mutual interference are disadvantages of using multi-needle equipment [18]. During the multi-needle electrospinning process, the solution may stratify in syringes if the spinning takes a long time, so a needleless free-surface-spinning machine Nanospider (Elmarco Company, Liberec, Czech Republic) with a rotating cylindrical electrode is preferred, which provides movement of the solution during the spinning and is designed for electrospinning\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2311 3 of 15\non a large scale. Electrospinning of the free surface is a multivariate process [19] and is influenced not only by the type of electrode and the composition of spinning solutions used but also by the climatic conditions in the room, which affect the evaporation of the solvent and other spinning parameters.\n2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Propolis Characterization\nPrevious studies have shown that propolis extract in water/ethanol mixtures does not dissolve but could be dissolved in 10\u201315% PVA water/ethanol solution and nanofibers could be obtained from this solution [7]. Some other investigations show ethanol solubilized propolis in a range of concentrations from 3 to 20% could be mixed with the 10 to 15% PVA water/ethanol solution and obtain fibers from solutions with various morphology [11\u201314]. In this study laboratory made propolis water (PW/BRA Lab) and ethyl alcohol propolis extract (PEx/BRA Lab) were prepared (Section 3.3) and used in view of the fact that the largest amount of spinning solution is water (90\u201394%), so propolis water is one of the most suitable for integration into the solution. Propolis is only partially soluble in water, and there are limited possibilities to obtain propolis water with the highest propolis content. This study analyzed two propolis water types obtained in a laboratory and two industrially produced with different propolis contents to evaluate their suitability for integration in a spinning solution (Table 1).

Electrospinning of the free surface is a multivariate process [19] and is influenced not only by the type of electrode and the composition of spinning solutions used but also by the climatic conditions in the room, which affect the evaporation of the solvent and other spinning parameters. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Propolis Characterization\nPrevious studies have shown that propolis extract in water/ethanol mixtures does not dissolve but could be dissolved in 10\u201315% PVA water/ethanol solution and nanofibers could be obtained from this solution [7]. Some other investigations show ethanol solubilized propolis in a range of concentrations from 3 to 20% could be mixed with the 10 to 15% PVA water/ethanol solution and obtain fibers from solutions with various morphology [11\u201314]. In this study laboratory made propolis water (PW/BRA Lab) and ethyl alcohol propolis extract (PEx/BRA Lab) were prepared (Section 3.3) and used in view of the fact that the largest amount of spinning solution is water (90\u201394%), so propolis water is one of the most suitable for integration into the solution. Propolis is only partially soluble in water, and there are limited possibilities to obtain propolis water with the highest propolis content. This study analyzed two propolis water types obtained in a laboratory and two industrially produced with different propolis contents to evaluate their suitability for integration in a spinning solution (Table 1). The combination of different propolis waters makes it possible to obtain fibers with customized properties depending on the planned use. The pH of propolis water affects the total pH of the solution and may result from the effect of fiber diameters, a slight decrease at a pH of 2 due to the decrease in viscosity in an acidic environment [9]. As can be seen from Table 1, the pH of all four propolis water samples are in range from 3.4 to 4.6. As part of this study, it has been found that the density of propolis water affects the total visco ity of the soluti n. The obtained data indicate that the highest density is for propolis water PW/LT (1.01 g/mL), which also contains the highest amount of propolis, and f r laboratory-made propolis water obtained from pr polis in Brazil and containing Arabic Gum (1.032 g/mL). The increase in density affects not only the total viscosity of the solution but also the mixing time r quired to diss lve the PVA. Arabic Gum (Gum Acacia) is used as stabilizer an a thickener in the food and pharmaceutic industries; therefore, n effect on density as xp cted. Arabic Gum is also useful for PVA film blends tensile properties improvement [20]. The propolis water added to the electrospinning solution effect on lectrical conductivity is significant. The conductivity of ropolis water samples was in a range from 352 to 1526 \u00b5S/cm. A too-high electrical conductivity (up to 1000 \u00b5S/cm) can result in an orientation of fibers per endicular to the support material. As shown in Tabl 1, PW/LT and PW/BRA Lab samples hav high conductivity, but it can be bal nced by the addition of low-conductivity propolis xtracts in the spin ing s lution.\nTable 1.

As shown in Table 1, PW/LT and PW/BRA Lab samples have high conductivity, but it can be balanced by the addition of low-conductivity propolis extracts in the spinning solution. High propolis content does not ensure high flavonoid content in propolis water. As shown in Table 1, PW/BRA Lab propolis contains the highest concentration of flavonoids (1.25 mg/g), but its propolis content is only 10%, in comparison with the PW/LT sample, which contains 30.8% propolis but only 0.087 mg/g of flavonoids.

Ethanolic extraction is commonly used for this purpose [6]. The pH of ethyl alcohol propolis extracts is more alkaline than that of propolis water, and no significant effect on fiber diameters is expected due to the excessively acidic environment in electrospinning solutions. Rapid reductions in viscosity can only be observed by adding high levels of ethyl alcohol extracts in low-concentration PVA spinning solutions due to the density rising from 0.885 to 0.905 g/mL (Table 3). Depending on the concentration of PVA, the conductivity of the electrospinning solution may decrease slightly. The main problem with the addition of propolis ethyl alcohol to PVA solutions is the formation of propolis agglomerates due to the reduction of alcohol concentration. It can be seen that the use of a higher alcohol concentration improves the content of flavonoids: 98% ethyl alcohol extract contains 8.87 and 7.53 mg/g, respectively, and 70% extract contains 5.75 mg/g (Table 3). The propolis harvested in Latvia (LV) has a higher flavonoids content in its alcohol extract (PEx/LV Lab) than that harvested in Brazil (BRA) when the alcohol extract (PEx/LV Lab) is obtained, but it is not fully comparable to the PEx/BRA Lab extract due to the small amount of Arabic Gum content in the propolis powder. The wax component of LV propolis has been previously removed. The Arabic Gum swells and dissolves in water, and it has the potential to be used as a wound dressing due to its antibacterial and hemostatic activity [22].\nSa ple Pa/BRA\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 15\nHigh propolis content does not ensure high flavonoid content in propolis water.

PVA/Propolis Extract Solution Characteristic The 125 kDa and 130 kDa PVA polymers have short mixing time and dissolution temperature (not exceeding 100 \u00b0C). Their viscosity and electrical conductivity are also suitable for all tested concentrations (6, 8, and 10 wt%). After the range of properties of PVA colloidal solutions were determined, possible strategies for the integration of propolis were developed and nanowebs for morphology analysis were made. We compared 6 wt% and 10 wt% PVA solutions to solutions to which propolis water has been added. As could be expected from the analysis of the properties, the addition of propolis water increases the viscosity, conductivity, and density for all samples (Figure 1). In particular, the viscosity of the 6PVA130 is close to a value of 60 mPa s, which is practically the lower limit of viscosity for spinning fibers with a cylindrical electrode. However, 6PVA125 viscosity is 80 mPa s, and PW/LT additive does not increase it substantially, but PW/BRA Lab increases viscosity dramatically up to 727 mPa s. The additive of PW/LT increases viscosity of 10PVA125 from 780 to 804 mPa s and 10PVA130 from 492 to 1004 mPa s. All solutions with the addition of propolis water have the appropriate viscosity for electrospinning in the range from 81 to 1004 mPa s (Figure 1a). The PVA solutions 125 KDa and 130 kDa have the same density, i.e., 1.015 (6 w%) and 1.022 g/mL (10 wt%), respectively, and replacing distilled water with propolis water PW/LT increases the density to 1.022 g/mL (6PVA125 and 6PVA130) and 1.033 g/mL (10PVA130 and 10PVA125), and replacing distilled water with PW/BRA Lab increases the density to 1.05 g/mL (6PVA125). (Figure 1c). Propolis water significantly increases the electrical conductivity of the spinning solutions (Figure 1b). The 6PVA126 conductivity increases from 103 to 1286 \u00b5S/cm when PW/LT additive is used and to 864 \u00b5S/cm when PW/BRA Lab is used. The conductivity of 10PVA125 increases from 210 to 1103 \u00b5S/cm and 10PVA130 from 366 to 1274 \u00b5S/cm when distilled water is replaced with PW/LT.

The web of 8PVA130 (Figure 2d) showed fibers with an average diameter of 255 \u00b1 4 nm, and the micrograph of sample 8PVA130 (PPa/BRA) show inclusions of spherical propolis wder particles not exceeding 7000 nm i size (Figure 2f) and fibers with an average diameter of 218 \u00b1 4 nm (Table 4).\ni r 2. Micrographs of electrospun webs: (a) 10PVA13 ; (b) 10PVA130(PW/LT); (c) 10PVA130 (PHGEx/BRA), (d) 8PVA130, (e) 10PVA130(PHGEx/BRA+ PEx/LV), (f) 8PVA130(PPa/BRA).\nTable 4. Fibers diameters.\nThe flavonoids content of fibers containing propolis water PW/LT (4.74\u20134.96 mg/g) is close to the calculated flavonoid content (4.42\u20134.96 mg/g). It allows a relatively accurate prediction of the flavonoids content in the fibers and shows that propolis is present not only in the spinning solution but also in the same amount in the fibers. The content of propolis in the fibers is 73.5 % (Table 5) and may be higher if a 6 wt% PVA concentration solution is used. With the addition of propolis powder, it is possible to obtain fibers with a propolis content of 33%. In future studies, combining propolis water and propolis powder has the potential to achieve even higher propolis content in the fibers. The flavonoids content of fibers containing propolis particles PPa/BRA (8.3\u20138.88 mg/g) is lower than calculated (12.86\u201313.2 mg/g), which means that fewer propolis particles from the solution enter the web, such that it is possible that the solution is too saturated with propolis particles (Table 5).\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2311 8 of 15\nThe flavonoids content of fibers containing propolis glycerol extract PHGEx/BRA (4.91\u20135.34 mg/g) is slightly higher than calculated (4.49\u20135.17 mg/g), but it still allows a relatively accurate prediction of total flavonoid content in the fiber web. As glycerol acts as a plasticizer, and in view of SEM micrographs showing the formation of flat fibers (Figure 2c), the 7 wt% amount of hydroglyceric propolis extract in the 10PVA130 spinning solution results in only 12% propolis content in fibers (Table 5) and should not be exceeded. The hydroglyceric propolis extract datasheet indicates that it contains 20\u201325% propolis, but a concentration of 20% was used for the calculation, which may explain the slightly higher content of flavonoids, and the content of propolis in the fibers may reach to 15% if the 25% extract concentration is used. The addition of propolis hydroglycerol extract and alcoholic extract in a 10 wt% PVA spinning solution allows to incorporate 26% of propolis in the electrospun fibers (Table 5), there are potential to add a higher amount of alcohol extract and reduce the PVA concentration to 8 wt% to achieve a higher propolis concentration in the electrospun fibers (depending on solution viscosity). The flavonoids content of fibers containing propolis extracts PHGEx/BRA and PEx/LV (32.72\u201333.54 mg/g) is a bit higher than calculated (30.33\u201331.01 mg/g), and the fiber web containing glycerol extract also had a slightly higher flavonoid content than expected, so the presence of glycerol in this sample is also likely to be due to a slightly higher actual flavonoid content than calculated.\n2.5. Solution Stability and Shelf Life\nThe sample 6PVA125(PW/LT) is homogeneous and can be spun even after 6 months (Figure S1a). The solution 6PVA125(PW/BRA Lab) precipitated 5 min after mixing with a magnetic stirrer (Figure S1c), and 3 h ultrasound mixing temporarily improved uniformity and particle size reduction, but the solution was also stratified after 5 min (Figure S1d\u2013f). Therefore, premixing is required. The samples 10PVA125(PW/LT) and 10PVA130(PW/LT) have excellent stability of solutions: their spinnability time is 6 months and premixing is not required, nor was precipitate or mold observed. After the solution 8PVA130(PPa/BRA) had settled for a week, a small precipitate was visible (Figure S2b). Additional ultrasonic mixing was also used to both reduce the particle size and improve the dispersion (Figure S2c\u2013f). After the solution was mixed with a magnetic stirrer, large agglomerates (6\u201359 \u00b5m) were visible in the micrographs (Figure S2a), but after ultrasonic treatment for 3 h, their size decreased, and the largest particles were 2\u201312 \u00b5m (Figure S2d\u2013f). No improvement was seen with processing longer than 3 h. After two weeks of storage at room temperature, mold appeared on the surface of the solution 8PVA130(PPa/BRA). The shelf life of the solution 10PVA130(PHGEx/BRA) (yellow, transparent, clear liquid) is approximately 6 months at room temperature (Figure S3), after which visual changes are visible. The solution was still spinnable but premixing was needed. In the solution 8PVA130(PEx/BRA Lab), the propolis particles were of different sizes and required sonication to decompose the propolis agglomerates. A small precipitate of propolis was visible after 1 h, and a clear precipitate of propolis was visible after 60 days (Figure S4), but spinnability time was only 1 week.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2311 9 of 15\nThe 10PVA130(PHGEx/BRA+PEx/LV) sample with propolis alcohol extract and hydroglyceric propolis extract spun more stable than without glycerol, and its shelf life was significantly increased (1 week to 3 months (Figure S3)). The stability of the solutions and shelf life are summarized in Table 6. Photographs and optical microscope images of the obtained solutions are shown in Figures S1\u2013S4.\nThe polyvinyl alcohol polymer matrix used in this research was obtained from SigmaAldrich Chemical Company (Darmstadt, Germany). The series of samples using different PVA molecular weights Mowiol 20\u201398 (Mw = ~125 kDa, degree of hydrolysis 98.0\u201398.8) and polyvinyl alcohol 18\u201388 (Mw = ~130 kDa, degree of hydrolysis 86.7\u201388.7) were performed; the melting point was 200 \u25e6C and the density was 1.269 g/cm3. The total flavonoids content was determined according to [23], using zirconium oxychloride (98%, Mw = 322.25, Sigma-Aldrich) and methanol (99.9%, Mw = 32.04%, Sigma-Aldrich). The ethyl alcohol (96.4\u201396.6%, Mw = 46.07, SIA Kalsnavas Elevators, Jaunkalsnava, Latvia) used to prepare the laboratory-made propolis extracts. The extract from Riga Pharmaceutic Factory (Riga, Latvia) contains 70% ethyl alcohol extract. Various types of propolis and its extracts were used (Table 7). The stages of the solution-mixing process are designated as marked (Figure 3). Laboratory distilled water (conductivity 1 \u00b5S/cm) was used to prepare PVA solutions and propolis extracts.\nTable 7.

If propolis water contains a precipitate, presonication is required before it is mixed with PVA. The addition of the propolis alcohol extract in one step with water leads to larger agglomerates than the addition once the PVA has dissolved, as the solubility of the propolis decreases as the concentration of ethyl alcohol decreases (propolis alcohol integration strategies, see also Figure S4). It is important to stir the solution rapidly and add the propolis extract to the cooled solution gradually. The sequences shown in Figures 8 and 9 can be combined by first adding propolis hydroglyceric extract to the PVA solution and then the ethyl alcohol extract.\nFigure 5.

A solution with a combination of propolis alcohol 7 wt% and hydroglyceric extract 7 wt% was also prepared (Table 9).\n3.7. Solution Shelf Life and Stability Evaluation After integration of the propolis in solution, it was divided into two parts. One part was spun, but the other part was allowed to stand at room temperature for 6 months. Every week, changes were inspected visually. As soon as a change was observed, the solution was electrospun to determine the spinnability. If there was a precipitate, premixing was performed.\n3.8.

Fabrications of Nanowebs\nThe cylinder-type electrode (\u00d8 20 mm, length 150 mm, 2/3 immersed into solution bath) was used to obtain nanowebs by using electrospinning equipment (Nanospider Lab 200 from Elamarco, Liberec, Czech Republic).

Electrospinning took place at 21.5 \u25e6C and relative air humidity ranged from 18 to 20%. Polypropylene nonwoven was used as a support material for fiber collection.\n4. Conclusions\nVarious propolis preparations were integrated into PVA electrospinning solutions, resulting in high-quality fiber webs that would benefit productivity and industrial applications. The obtained fiber webs could be used in biomedicine and bioprotective systems, and the material consists of edible ingredients, extending its applications. Various propolis integration strategies using different propolis additives allow for the incorporation of more than 73% propolis into the fibers. The combination of propolis water, hydroglyceric propolis extract, and ethyl alcohol propolis extract can increase propolis content even more. The highest propolis content in the fibers can be integrated using propolis water (73.5 wt%) and the highest flavonoid content was achieved using a combination of ethyl alcohol and glycerol extracts (33.13 \u00b1 0.41 mg/m). Using 130 kDa PVA allows propolis extracts to be incorporated using lower mixing temperatures and times than 125 kDa PVA. Both molecular weights are suitable for the integration of propolis at a concentration of not less than 6 wt% because the viscosity is sufficient. The only exception is a 6 wt% 130 kDa PVA solution, with insufficient viscosity to add ethyl alcohol extracts, so the 8 wt% concentration is recommended. By determining the flavonoids content of propolis extracts (which allows predicting bioactivity), it is also possible to predict the flavonoid content in the fibers. Solutions for electrospinning with propolis water and hydroglyceric propolis extract have a shelf life of up to 6 months at room temperature, but premixing is required. The addition of hydroglyceric propolis extract improves the shelf life and spinnability of solutions that are less stable. For solutions with propolis particles integrated as a powder or with alcoholic extract, it is better to spin them immediately. The most suitable PVA molecular weights for propolis integration are 125 kDa and 130 kDa when 6 wt% is used as the lowest concentration and the samples are spun with roller-type equipment using cylindrical electrode.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2311 14 of 15\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27072311/s1, Table S1: Electrospinning solutions designations and contents; Table S2: Data of propolis and its extracts; Table S3: Data of propolis particle size after various mixing cycles of spinning solution 8PVA130(PPa/BRA) *; Figures S1\u2013S4: Photographs and optical microscope images of the obtained solutions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.Z. and S.K., writing\u2014original draft preparation, Z.Z., writing\u2014review and editing, Z.Z., S.K. and L.V., visualization, Z.Z, investigation, Z.Z., L.V. and S.J., project administration, Z.Z., methodology, Z.Z. and S.K.
