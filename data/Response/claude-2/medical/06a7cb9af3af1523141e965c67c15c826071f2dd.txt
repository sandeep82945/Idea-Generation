 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a large-scale epidemiological study to determine the prevalence of SEOMs in the general population and in patients with specific conditions like strabismus. This could clarify if SEOMs are truly rare or underdiagnosed.  

2. Perform a longitudinal study following patients with SEOMs over time to understand the natural progression. This could reveal if SEOMs are stable or prone to changes that impact vision and eye movements.

3. Examine the embryological development of SEOMs through animal models to elucidate their origins. This could test theories about aberrant muscle development vs evolutionary remnants. 

4. Analyze SEOM structure and innervation patterns using histology and imaging. This could classify SEOM subtypes and clarify if they are functionally active muscles.

5. Investigate surgical outcomes of strabismus repair and SEOM removal. This could determine best practices for improving motility and vision in symptomatic patients.
