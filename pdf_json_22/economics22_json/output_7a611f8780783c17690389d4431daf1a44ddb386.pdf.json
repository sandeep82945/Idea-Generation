Currently, U.S. states spend about $26,000 per child each year, on aver age, on income sup port pro grams, health ser vices, pub lic edu ca tion, and invest ments in hous ing, parks, and librar ies, with strik ing var i a tion in spend ing amounts across states (Greenberg et al. 2021). A large lit er a ture within and beyond the United States has dem on strated how income sup port, health, and edu ca tional pro grams improve the out comes of low income chil dren (Jackson 2015; Johnson 2015; Markowitz et al. 2017; Parolin 2021; Strully et al. 2010) and has argued that pub lic expen di tures on chil dren may increase equal ity of oppor tu nity (Bradbury et al. 2015; Corak 2013; Waldfogel 2016).\nHowmuch do children\u2014and which children\u2014benefit from social spending? Using annual data from the StatebyState Spending on Kids Dataset between 1997 and 2016, linked to annual birth data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) from 1998 to 2017, we draw on geo graphic and tem po ral var i a tion in the United States to exam ine how social spend ing on income sup port, health, and housingprogramsthatbenefitparentsandchildrenisassociatedwithinfanthealth.

Much existing research on social spend ing has con sid ered its effects on child pov erty and house hold income. Child pov erty rates vary sub stan tially within the United States, rang ing from 10% in Iowa to over 20% in California (Laird et al. 2018; Renwick and Fox 2016), and this strik ing var i a tion is partly a result of state dif fer encesinpublicbenefits(BradyandParolin2020; Wimer et al. 2020).\nBeyond pov erty, how does infant health vary with social spend ing in U.S. states? Much research exam in ing the state con text and infant health has focused on par tic u lar social pol i cies or pro grams, or on the effects of polit i cal fac tors such as gov er nance struc ture. For exam ple, chil dren exposed to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or gen er ous school funding regimes expe ri ence bet ter health than their peers (Jackson 2015; Johnson 2015). The intro duc tion and sub se quent expan sion of the Med ic aid pro gram in 1965 led to improve ments in child health and declines in infant mor tal ity and hos pi tal i za tions (Currie et al. 2006; Currie and Gruber 1996; GoodmanBacon 2018). Additionally, there are strong pos i tive effects of the enact ment of income sup port pro grams, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (e.g., Gundersen and Kreider 2009; Hoynes et al. 2016; Markowitz et al. 2017; Strully et al. 2010), and the pro vi sion of hous ing assis tance (Fenelon et al. 2021) on child health. In con trast, recent work doc u ments poorer infant health in Republicancon trolled states, as well as in states with puni tive pol i cies that tar get and restrict rights among immi grants (Torche and Rauf 2021; Torche and Sirois 2019).\nA focus on indi vid ual pol i cies is cru cial and espe cially valu able for iden ti fy ing the causal effects of a pol icy after its implementation or expan sion. We argue that exam in ing expen di tures is also use ful because it affords con sid er ation of the rel a tive impor tance of dif fer ent forms of spend ing for child health. Although the United States rep re sents a lim ited wel fare state rel a tive to other indus tri al ized countries (Bradbury et al. 2015;Garfinkeletal.2010), pub lic spend ing on chil dren has grown over time (Isaacs and Edelstein 2017). Federal, state, and local gov ern ments must there fore deter mine how to spend funding for the chil dren and fam i lies who rely on it, mak ing it use ful to under stand how dif fer ent forms of spend ing maybenefit infant health.However, it is not clearwhether health or nonhealth spend ing should be most strongly asso ci ated with infant health. Among adults, phys i cal health out comes are more strongly asso ci ated with spend ing on social ser vices than with spend ing on health (Bradley et al. 2016; Kim and Jennings 2009; Ronzio et al. 2004). The rel a tive impor tance of expen di tures on social ser vices com pared to spend ing on health and other pro grams is less under stood for infants. Understanding these ques tions is crit i cal for advanc ing knowl edge about how pol i cies and pro grams can address the social deter mi nants of health, in addi tion to solely expanding access to health care, given the high cost of health care deliv ery and pro nounced effects of income, edu ca tion, and social envi ron men tal fac tors on health (Bradley et al. 2016; Lawrence et al. 2020).

This is a sen si ble approach given that mater nal edu ca tion and eco nomic dis ad van tage strongly pre dict poor infant health (Currie and Moretti 2003; Kandel et al. 2009). In addi tion, pub lic spend ing on many pro grams is con sid er ably higher for lower income fam i lies than for higher income fam i lies (Vericker 2012), though the 2021 expan sion of the Child Tax Credit rep re sents a nota ble excep tion (Marr et al. 2021). Social spendingshoulddisproportionatelybenefitlowerSESfamilies,bothbyproviding direct cash assis tance and by pro vid ing neces si ties (food, health care) that par ents would oth er wise need to pur chase or forgo (Milligan and Stabile 2009; Yeung et al. 2002). Such invest ments allow lowresource par ents to make invest ments in them selves and their chil dren that are more sim i lar to those of higher resource fam i lies (Jackson and Schneider 2022; Leininger et al. 2010).\nHowever, many income and health sup ports at the state level are avail able to fam i lies above 200% of the pov erty thresh old. The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), for exam ple, is avail able in many states to chil dren between 300% and 400% of the pov erty thresh old. Social spend ing can also improve out comes for allchildren,eveniflowereducatedfamiliesbenefitdisproportionately.Forexam ple,publichealthinsurancespendingcanyieldmedicalimprovementsthatbenefit chil dren across socio eco nomic groups (Currie and Gruber 2001; Finkelstein 2007). Even adults with insur ance are less likely to have acces si ble and highqual ity med i cal ser vices when they live in com mu ni ties with low rates of insurance and, as a result, are less likely to have a place to go when they are sick and need to receive reg u lar med i cal care (Pauly and Pag\u00e1n 2007). Moreover, stud ies of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and other income sup port pro grams sug gest that lower lev els of wel fare gen er os ity are asso ci ated with higher lev els of com mu nitylevel crime (Liebertz and Bunch 2018), and that SNAP expen di tureshavebenefitsthatextendbeyondtheeligibleincomegroups,increasingthe incomes of SNAPinel i gi ble house holds as well (Hanson et al. 2002; Lewin and Weber 2020). Such evi dence sug gests that social spend ing should be most pos i tively asso ci ated with health among infants born to lowSES moth ers, with pos i tive but less pronounced health benefits among infants born to higher SESmothers (Hypothesis 1). If social spend ing has the most pos i tive effects among infants with lowSES moth ers, then it may have an equal iz ing effect on pro nounced gaps in infant health by SES (Corak 2013; Solon 2004) (Hypothesis 2). Alternatively, if higher edu cated moth ers are bet ter able to lever age pol icy oppor tu ni ties and access resources (Phelan and Link 2015; Phelan et al. 2010), then edu ca tional gaps in infant health may increase (Hypothesis 3).\nD ow nloaded from http://read.dukeupress.edu/dem ography/article-pdf/59/5/1873/1646360/1873jackson.pdf by guest on 25 January 2024\n1877Social Spending and Infant Health"

Greater expen di tures on both income sup port and inkind ser vices may lead to improve ments in infant health by improv ing mater nal wellbeing and nutri tion, as well as both the amount and qual ity of med i cal care avail able to moth ers and babies (Currie 2008).\nIncreased expen di tures on health pro grams for chil dren should make it more likely that fam i lies will have health insur ance and that a greater num ber of health care pro vid ers will be avail able to treat patients with pub lic insur ance\u2014and hence that fam i lies will have an eas ier time accessing care and pro vid ers will be able to spend more time with patients (Currie et al. 1995; GoodmanBacon 2018). Beyond spend ing on health care, increases in income through fed eral and statelevel invest ments in cash or tax credit pro grams such as the EITC also improve moth ers\u2019 abil ity to increase their pre na tal care usage, or even to switch from pub lic to pri vate insur ance (Hoynes et al. 2015; Lenhart 2019). Greater social spend ing on chil dren and fam i lies may there fore improve infant health by allowing moth ers to receive more and bet ter pre na tal care.\nImprovements in the amount and qual ity of resources avail able to moth ers, whether in the form of house hold resources or access to ser vices, may also affect health behav iors asso ci ated with mater nal stress and \u201ccog ni tive load\u201d (Gennetian andShafir2015).Researchexaminingpublicbenefitsand\u201ccoping\u201dhealthbehaviors stronglyassociatedwithfinancialstressandmaternalmentalhealthshowsthat,for example,childtaxbenefitexpansionsleadtoimprovementsinmaternalhealthand reduc tions in depres sion and smok ing (Milligan and Stabile 2011; Strully et al. 2010), and largerSNAPbenefits are associatedwith improvements in caregiver physical health and reduc tions in psy cho log i cal dis tress (Ettinger de Cuba et al. 2019; Oddo and Mabli 2015).

The mean pro por tion of low birth weight and pre term births dur ing our study period is 6% and 10%, respec tively. Consistent with prior research, this pat tern varies strik ingly by mater nal edu ca tion: the rate of low birth weight is twice as high among moth ers with less than a high school edu ca tion (8%) than among moth ers with a col lege degree or more (4%), with a decreas ing gra di ent for the edu ca tional groups in between. There is also con sis tent var i a tion across edu ca tional groups in mater nal char ac ter is tics. The highest edu cated moth ers are more likely than the low est edu cated moth ers to be older at the time of a child\u2019s birth (32 vs. 24 years), and births to the highest edu cated moth ers are more likely to occur to mar ried par ents (92% vs. 37%) and to nonHis panic White moth ers (73% vs. 30%).\nTurning to statelevel char ac ter is tics, the mean social spend ing per year on chil dren and fam i lies between 1997 and 2016 on the forms of state spend ing we con sider was $6,970 per child. The major ity of this spend ing takes the form of cash or tax based income sup port ($4,140), with a smaller but siz able share on health spend ing ($2,330) and the smallest amount on hous ing ($500). During the study period, the aver age unem ploy ment rate was 5.9%, the pov erty rate was 13.3%, and the min i mum wage was $6.29 per hour. About 12% of state res i dents are Black, 16% are His panic, and 28% have a col lege degree in an aver age state\u2013year, with 42% of state\u2013years hav ing a Democratic gov er nor.\nFigure 1 shows the amount of var i a tion across states in perchild spend ing dur ing our study period. Perchild spend ing on both cash and tax credit income sup port pro grams jumped sharply in 2010 owing to the increased eco nomic need (and cor re spond ing increased gov ern ment invest ment) dur ing the Great Recession. While cash income sup port steadily declined after 2010, tax credit spend ing stayed at higher lev els after 2010 than in pre vi ous years. Spending on both types of pro grams var ies widely across states, as shown by the var i a tion within par tic u lar years. Perchild spend ing on health increased more grad u ally than spend ing on income sup port pro grams over this roughly 20year period, none the less pro duc ing ample var i a tion over the study period. Finally, increases and decreases in spend ing on hous ing and com mu nity devel op ment are more mod est dur ing the period, also show ing con sid er able var i a tion in spend ing across states.\nFigure A1 in the online appen dix pres ents the bivar i ate rela tion ship between social spend ing and infant health, by mater nal edu ca tion.

Because var i a tion across state\u2013years in spend ing on hous ing is smaller (SD = 0.30) than var i a tion in other forms of spend ing (e.g., SD = 1.11 for cash spend ing), the\nimpor tance of hous ing spend ing is min i mized within the frame work of stan dard devi a tion com par i sons. However, it is nota ble that, dol lar for dol lar, state spend ing on housing and community development is associatedwith significantly greater improve ments in low birth weight than spend ing on cash sup port or other forms of invest ment.\n1893Social Spending and Infant Health\nInterestingly, the pat tern of results is in the oppo site direc tion for the case of tax credits(whichincludeEITCandtheChildTaxCredit),wherethebenefitsofsuch invest ments increase as mater nal edu ca tion increases (panel c of Figure 2). Supple mentary ana ly ses, shown in online appen dix Table A2, show that this result is fairly con sis tent across both pro grams and espe cially pro nounced for the case of the Child Tax Credit, which dur ing the period of our study excluded mil li ons of lowincome fam i lies by design (Goldin and Michelmore 2020).\nTable 4presentscoefficientestimatesforourothermeasureofinfanthealth:the share of pre term births. Results are sim i lar in direc tion to those for low birth weight, and slightly larger in mag ni tude. Model 2 of Table 4 shows that a $1,000 increase in total social spend ing leads to a decrease in the rate of pre term birth of .16 of a per cent age point\u2014in other words, a 1SD increase in total social spend ing decreases the rate of pre term birth by over a third of a per cent age point (.366). Following the same logic as ear lier, at the pop u la tion level this amount of increase in total social spend ing on chil dren would lead to 1,805 (493,397 \u00d7 .00366) fewer pre term births among the low est edu cated moth ers. Figure A2 in the online appen dix dis plays sim i lar results forpretermbirthformostspecificformsofsocialspending,withsignificantlyhigher benefitsofspendingoncashincomesupportprogramscomparedwithotherformsof spend ing. A 1SD increase in spend ing on cash sup port decreases the rate of pre term birth by .27 of a per cent age point (where 1 SD of income sup port spend ing is $1,110), com pared with decreases of .17 and .02 of a per cent age point in pre term birth rates for each 1 SD of health and hous ing spend ing, respec tively. Cash spend ing has the larg est asso ci a tion with pre term birth in both stan dard devi a tion units and in terms of the dol larfordol lar impact. This is par tially incon sis tent with the results for low birth weight, where hous ing spend ing had the larg est perdol lar asso ci a tion.

We show pre dic tions for low birth weight in Figure 3 (the over all pat tern is sim i lar for pre term birth). The results are more con sis tent with Hypothesis 2 (that a stron ger local wel fare state for chil dren and fam i lies reduces gaps in infant health across edu ca tional groups) than Hypothesis 3. Panel a of Figure 3 shows that as state spend ing increases, there is a decrease in the gap in low birth weight between those with less than a high school edu ca tion and those with a col lege degree. When total state spend ing is less than 2 SD below the mean (e.g., Utah in the late 1990s), the gap in low birth weight is 20%, with 7.4% ver sus 5.9% of babies predicted to be low birth weight in the low est and highest edu cated fam i lies, respec tively. In the highest spend ing state con texts, this gap decreases by almost 30%. The predicted per cent age of low birth weight infants declines by .7 of a per cent age point among the low est edu cated moth ers, and by .2 of a per cent age point among the highest edu cated moth ers.\nPanels b\u2013e of Figure 3 show the same pre dic tions for cash income sup port, tax cred its, health, and hous ing spend ing, respec tively. With the impor tant excep tion of tax credit spend ing, the pat tern of con ver gence is sim i lar across spend ing domains and is most pro nounced for cash income sup port and hous ing spend ing, where con ver gence in the per cent age of low birth weight infants\u2014a reduc tion in the gap between the highest and low est edu cated moth ers\u2014declines by about 40% and is driven entirely by declines in the rate of low birth weight among the low est edu cated moth ers. Educational con ver gence in low birth weight is less pro nounced for the case of health spend ing, where the rate of low birth weight is predicted to decline among both the low est and highest edu cated moth ers. This pat tern may be driven by the rel a tive gen er os ity of state health insur ance pro grams, which cover fam i lies up to 300\u2013400% of the pov erty thresh old and are there fore more likely to include higher edu cated moth ers. While higher edu cated moth ers may be more likely to take advan tage of state health insur ance pro grams when they qual ify, lessedu cated moth ers are morelikelytoqualify,resultingininfanthealthbenefitsatbothhighandlowlevels of edu ca tion. Overall, these results sug gest that, while inequal ity in infant health remains even in highspend ing state con texts, the gap is sub stan tially smaller when states invest in a strong wel fare state for chil dren and fam i lies."

We con duct a pla cebo test that uses the same mod el ing frame work to regress infant health on mea sures of state spend ing that should not be plau si bly related to child health, using data from the U.S. Census Survey of State and Local Government Finances.\n1900 M.

Using Eq.

Under the assump tion of sequen tial ignorability (Imai et al. 2011), we esti mate the pro por tion of the spend ing effect medi ated through each poten tial mech a nism and the sen si tiv ity of those medi a tion esti ma tes to vio la tion of the sequen tial ignorability assump tion (Hicks and Tingley 2011).6\nPanel A of the online appen dix Table A4 shows that, con sis tent with the main analyses, interaction terms indicate generally smaller benefits at higher levels of mater nal edu ca tion. Panel B in Table A4 shows the pro por tion of the effect of total spend ing on low birth weight (shown in Table 3) that is medi ated by ser vice access and health behav iors asso ci ated with pre na tal stress. Among moth ers with less than high school, the num ber of pre na tal vis its medi ates about 16% of the effect of total spendingonlowbirthweight,whileanyprenatalcareandcareinthefirsttrimester account for 2% and 4%, respec tively, of the total effect. Tobacco use, alco hol use, weekly drinks, and weight gain dur ing preg nancy account for less than 1% of the total spend ing effect, while aver age daily cig a rettes dur ing preg nancy accounts for about 14%. Results are con sis tent for pre term birth, shown in panel C. While medi a tion results should be interpreted with cau tion (see sen si tiv ity esti ma tes in pan els A and B), these results are con sis tent with the pos si bil ity that moth ers\u2019 abil ity to receive more and bet ter pre na tal care\u2014espe cially more fre quent care\u2014and to avoid pre na tal smok ing par tially explains the pos i tive effect of social spend ing on infant health.

Understanding these ques tions is crit i cal for advanc ing knowl edge about whether and which invest ments in chil dren may yield large div i dends for the health of the next gen er a tion. Using annual data from the StatebyState Spending on Kids Dataset between 1997 and 2016, linked to annual birth data from the National Vital Statistics System from 1998 to 2017, we draw on geo graphic and tem po ral var i a tion in the United States to ask how much children\u2014andwhich children\u2014benefit from different forms of statelevel social spend ing.\nOur analyses reveal that, first, social spending has especially positive benefits for rates of both low birth weight and pre term birth among babies born to moth ers withlessthanahighschooleducation.Thesebenefitsaremeaningfulatthepopu la tion level, such that a com monly observed amount of var i a tion in social spend ing results in a decrease in the rate of low birth weight by .17 per cent age points, or over 800 fewer low birth weight births among the low est edu cated moth ers in a given year. This pat tern is broadly con sis tent across the sev eral types of social spend ing weexamine,withthemostpronouncedhealthbenefitsresultingfrominvestmentsin cash income sup ports for fam i lies.\nThere is also evi dence that invest ments in hous ing have the larg est dol larfordol lar asso ci a tion with low birth weight. One hypoth e sis for the greater asso ci a tion between hous ing spend ing and low birth weight (vs. pre term birth) is that invest ments in hous ing and com mu nity devel op ment\u2014which include rental assis tance, neigh bor hood revi tal i za tion, and pub lic hous ing con struc tion\u2014are espe cially valu able for free ing up resources that bet ter enable ade quate nutri tion and weight gain through out preg nancy, both of which are strong deter mi nants of low birth weight. For exam ple, dur ing the tem po rary reform of the Child Tax Credit in 2021 that expanded eli gi bil ity to the poor est lowincome fam i lies, recip i ents of this cash assis tance were bet ter able to pay reg u lar expenses, includ ing food expenses (Lens et al. 2022). Maternal stress is another poten tial rea son for the stron ger asso ci a tion between hous ing spend ing and low birth weight. Housing inad e quacy is an impor tant and per sis tent source of stress (Campagna 2016), which increases the like li hood of low birth weight (Torche 2011). Gaining a bet ter under stand ing of these and other rea sons why cer tain forms of spend ing are more impor tant for some birth out comes is a valu able area for future inquiry.\nIncome sup port in the form of tax cred its pro vi des an impor tant excep tion to this pattern,asnoinfanthealthbenefitswereobservedamongthelowesteducatedmoth ers. These unique results for tax credit spend ing may be driven by the fact that, dur ing our study period, both tax pro grams excluded the low est income fam i lies, resulting in the major ity of fam i lies in the bot tom 30% of the income dis tri bu tion receiv ing a par tial or no credit (Goldin and Michelmore 2020). For exam ple, chil dren who were eligiblefor thefullChildTaxCredituntil2021weremuchmoreaffluent thanthe over all pop u la tion, while inel i gi ble chil dren had sub stan tially lower fam ily incomes (Goldin and Michelmore 2020). While tax cred its pos i tively affect indi vid u als who receive them (Hoynes et al. 2015), those with less than a high school edu ca tion are most likely to be in the low est earn ings group. Therefore, it stands to rea son that investmentsintaxcreditspendingmaydisproportionatelyaffectandbenefithigher edu cated moth ers. The recent tem po rary expan sion of both the EITC and Child Tax Credit in the Amer i can Rescue Plan elim i nated many of these exclu sions, mak ing the\nD ow nloaded from http://read.dukeupress.edu/dem ography/article-pdf/59/5/1873/1646360/1873jackson.pdf by guest on 25 January 2024\n1903Social Spending and Infant Health\ncred its much more widely avail able to the low est SES fam i lies and suggesting that thisfindingcouldchangeintheaftermathoftheseexpansions.\nAsecondmajorfindingisthatthebenefitsofsocialspendingaregenerallyless pro nounced among chil dren born to higher edu cated moth ers and, because of this pat tern, edu ca tional gaps in infant health decline as social spend ing increases. When spend ing is high, the predicted per cent age of low birth weight infants declines by nearly a full per cent age point among lowedu cated moth ers while remaining sta ble among higher edu cated moth ers, resulting in a 30% decline in the edu ca tional gap in infant health. It is nota ble that this pat tern of con ver gence across edu ca tional groups is less pro nounced for health spend ing than for other forms of social spend ing, per haps because state health insur ance pro grams are more likely to cover fam i lies fur ther above the pov erty thresh old than other social ser vices. While sam ple sizes limit the abil ity to exam ine racial var i a tion within mater nal edu ca tion groups by state and year, a pri or ity for future research is to con sider racial inequal ity in the effects of social spend ing. Beyond socio eco nomic sta tus, racial inequal ity in infant health is also sub stan tial, with par tic u larly large Black\u2013White gaps in birth weight, pre term deliv ery, and infant mor tal ity (Conley et al. 2003; Cramer 1995; Schoendorf et al. 1992). Even among the low est edu cated fam i lies, White moth ers maybenefitmorefromsomeformsofsocialspending,suchasMedicaid,because of unequal access to qual ity health care (Institute of Medicine 2003b), and the psy cho log i cal and phys i o log i cal embodi ment of rac ism and dis crim i na tion is more likely to be expe ri enced by nonWhite fam i lies in their inter ac tions with social ser vices and the state (Rosenthal and Lobel 2011). Alternatively, nonWhite fam i lies maybenefitfromstateinvestmentsbecauseofthegreaterlikelihoodofeconomic dis ad van tage among Black and His panic moth ers (Aizer and Currie 2014). Sensi tivity ana ly ses sug gest that the pat terns observed for the total pop u la tion per sist but are less pro nounced among nonLatino White births, suggesting the impor tance of future research that con sid ers racial/eth nic var i a tion in the effects of social spend ing in greater depth.\nWe conducted a num ber of sen si tiv ity ana ly ses to assess the robust ness of our results to pos si ble threats, includ ing ana ly ses of pla cebo effects, inclu sion of state specific linear and quadratic time trends, a truncated time period following the GreatRecession, examinationofmissingdata and individuallevelfindings, and sam ple restric tions to higher order births and nonLatino White births.
