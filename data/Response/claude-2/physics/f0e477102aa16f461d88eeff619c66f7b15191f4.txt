 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Isolate and characterize the new compounds detected in the paper (e.g. pterocarpans, alkyl glycosides in cucumber; lignans, phenyl-caffeic/ferulic acid conjugates in bottle gourd) to determine their pharmacological activities. 

2. Investigate the biosynthesis of characteristic phytochemicals in cucumber (e.g. saponins, isoflavones, pterocarpans) and compare to legumes to understand shared pathways.

3. Evaluate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial activities of the identified sesquiterpenes and acylated flavonoids in vitro and in vivo.

4. Examine the potential of bottle gourd for skin care applications based on the presence of beneficial fatty acids, vitamins, and azelaic acid. Compare to cucumber's established effects.

5. Conduct gene expression analysis on enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of differential metabolites in both species (e.g. acetyltransferases for acylated flavonoids) to correlate gene-metabolite data.
