    "abstractText": "Intracellular transport of cargoes in the cell is essential for the organization and functioning cells, especially those that are large and elongated. The cytoskeletal networks inside large cells can be highly complex, and this cytoskeletal organization can have impacts on the distance and trajectories of travel. Here, we experimentally created microtubule networks with varying mesh sizes and examined the ability of kinesin-driven quantum dot cargoes to traverse the network. Using the experimental data, we deduced parameters for cargo detachment at intersections and away from intersections, allowing us to create an analytical theory for the run length as a function of mesh size. We also used these parameters to perform simulations of cargoes along paths extracted from the experimental networks. We find excellent agreement between the trends in run length, displacement, and trajectory persistence length comparing the experimental and simulated trajectories.",

            "text": "The movement and positioning of large objects inside cells requires energy-using active transport by motor proteins traversing along cytoskeletal filaments [1]. This process of intracellular transport is responsible for the organization and reorganization that cells need to survive. Intracellular transport is especially important in cells that are long and extended, such as cilia and axons, or particularly crowded and viscous. In mammalian cells, which are differentiated into a myriad of cell types, diffusion of large cellular components is impeded by the complex viscoelastic nature of the cell interior, so active intracellular transport is required.\nCytoskeletal filaments, microtubules and actin, serve as the tracks for intracellular transport. Microtubules are particularly used for long-distance transport [1, 2]. Prior works have shown that the arrangement of the cytoskeletal filaments can affect the transport properties of single motors and teams of motors attached to cargoes [3\u201311]. For long-distance transport, the microtubules are arranged in logical parallel bundles to take advantage of kinesin motors that move distally toward the microtubule plus ends and cytoplasmic dynein motors that move inward to the microtubule minus ends [12, 13]. In other cell types or locations, the cytoskeletal networks are more complicated. For instance, in muscle cells, microtubules create a cross-hatched network creating intersections for organelles and plasma membrane to anchor during large scale extensions and contractions [14, 15]. Prior experimental cellular work has demonstrated that the organization of the cytoskeleton can control the association, dissociation, and trajectory of vesicles that can dynamically change in time and space [11, 16].\nThere are still open questions about how dense, complex, and crowded conditions can regulate, control, and inhibit intracellular transport. In order to probe the parameters of control, we created microtubule networks of varying densities, characterized by the mesh size, the distance between intersections of microtubules. Using these networks we experimentally probed the trajectories of kinesin-laden quantum dots as they traverse the network. The same networks were used as the basis for simulated trajectories for cargoes where the rates of dissociation at intersections and along the filaments were determined from experiments, making for closer comparisons. We also deduced an analytical function for the run length dependence on mesh size to compare to both experiments and simulations. By comparing the experimental, simulated, and theoretical results, we determined the effects of the network mesh size on the motion of kinesin-driven cargoes."

To polymerize the tubulin, we added GTP to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated for 20 min at 34oC. Finally, we added 20 \u00b5M Taxol to stabilize the polymerized microtubules and incubated at 34oC for 20 min to equilibrate the Taxol.

Kinesin was purified using standard protocols previously described [17\u201319]. Briefly, the plasmid containing the kinesin construct was transfected into BL21 cells (New England Biolabs) and bacteria were selected using ampicillin in the media. Overnight cultures that included biotin in the media were pelleted and the bacteria was lysed using sonication and chemical lysis. The supernatent was separated from the bacteria debris using centrifugation and then incubated with nickel beads to bind the 6x-his tagged protein. Kinesin was eluted using imidizole and fractions with kinesin were desalted to remove excess imidizole. Kinesin was aliquoted and snap frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC."

We made the chamber by adhering four square pieces of double-sided tape on a glass slide such that it made a crossed flow path (Fig. 1A). The slide was bound to a silanized cover glass treated with hydrophobic silane, PlusOne Repel silane (Cytiva) as previously described [20].\nTo create the sample, the following reagents were flowed into the chamber. First, we flowed 15 \u00b5l of 10% \u03b1-tubulin antibody (YL1/2) into the chamber and incubated for 5 minutes. This surface layer provided a specific interaction to the microtubules and helped to elevate them above the polymer surface coating, which was added next. The polymer surface was made by adding 10 \u00b5l of 5% Pluronic F-127 block copolymer from both directions of the flow chamber and incubating for 5 min. The pluronic blocks the surface from other proteins non-specifically binding. Next we washed the chamber with wash buffer (90 \u00b5l PEM-80, 10 \u00b5l of 0.5% Pluronic F-127). Now that our surface was well coated and blocked, we flowed 10 \u00b5l of polymerized microtubules diluted to 0.5 mg/ml tubulin concentration. We flowed from the x-direction, incubated for 2 minutes, washed with wash buffer, and incubated for another 3 minutes. We repeated the same process in the y-direction. The chamber was imaged to ensure microtubule networks were bound to the surface and at the densities needed."

We noticed that the mesh size could change significantly over the imaging region of our camera, which was 82 \u00b5m on a side. In order to have the entire region have a similar mesh size, we divided each image into quarters for analysis of both the mesh size and the trajectories (see below). This gave more consistent network mesh sizes over an area of 41x41 \u00b5m2. The same networks were extracted and used as the basis for simulated trajectories (see below).\nWe quantified the distance between intersections using the FIJI/ImageJ AnalyzeSkeleton (2D/3D) plugin [21]. First, we smoothed the images to remove fluctuations in the background caused by shot noise. Next, we performed background subtraction on the images to remove global intensity variations due to the imaging. We converted the image into a binary image by using the auto threshold function to make the microtubules white on a black background (Fig. 1C). This helps in distinguishing signal (microtubules) from background. We then skeletonized the image\nusing the binary/skeleton command in FIJI/ImageJ (Fig. 1D). Finally, we applied the AnalyzeSkeleton (2D/3D) plugin with prune ends and prune cycle shortest branch enabled. The data reported were the largest shortest path, detailed info, and labeled skeletons. The resulting data displayed the branch information, which was saved as a text file. We used the branch length given in microns as the data for the mesh size. The statistics of the data were calculated and the distribution was normal, so the mean and the median were the same. The error bars reported are the standard error of the mean.

Within Trackmate, we used a setting of 6 pixels for the diameter of the objects and we allowed a gap in time of 2 frames, so that more than 2 frames without detecting the object nearby resulted in terminating the measurement. We also used a minimum cut off run length of 3 pixels (160 nm/pixel) and 3 frames (1 s/frame). The localization was allowed to be sub-pixel. Each of the tracks were manually checked against the movie to ensure the trajectory tracked was reasonable. The x,y position data over time were used as the trajectories for further analysis. Example trajectories on different networks are show in figure 2. The number of tracks analyzed for each network is given in Appendix table A1.\nThe run length of a trajectory was determined as the contour length of the trajectory where the absolute value of all the displacements were summed. The displacement of a trajectory was defined as the end-to-end distance of the trajectory. The instantaneous speed was calculated as the positive displacement between two frames divided by the time between frames. The average speed was determined as the run length divided by the total time the quantum dot was associated to the network. For all data types, the data was averaged and the standard deviation or standard error of the mean was used as error bars. The number of tracked trajectories used for each network is given in Appendix table A1.\nTo quantify the characteristic persistence length of the trajectory, we calculated the mean squared displacement (MSD) and plotted it versus the contour length of the trajectory. The MSD was calculated by measuring the displacement for all points along the trajectory at a specific lag time (time between frames). For each lag time, the displacement values were squared and averaged. This is performed for all the lag times that have more than 5 data points and plotted for only the first 80 points. Once we calculate the MSD as a function of lag time, we also determined the run length (total contour length from initial time) of the trajectory for all time. The run length from zero time is plotted as the x-coordinate and the MSD as a function of lag time is plotted on the y-coordinate. The MSD was fit to a worm-like chain model with this equation:\nMSD(Lc) = 2LpLc\n[ 1\u2212 Lp\nLc (1\u2212 exp(\u2212Lc/Lp)\n] (1)\nwhere MSD(Lc) is the mean squared displacement as a function of the contour length, Lc, and Lp is the persistence length, which is a fit parameter."

A cargo of radius r was initialized at a random point in the 2-dimensional box containing the extracted network. It was allowed to diffusively search and bind to a filament. The simulation time starts from the time when the cargo bound to the filament. After binding, the cargo ballistically moved toward one of the filament ends, i.e. in a time step \u2206t, the cargo position moved by v\u2206t towards the next vertex, where v is the velocity of cargo. The polarity of the filament was chosen randomly when the cargo bound and was fixed throughout the given cargo run. As a cargo walked ballistically on the filament, it could stochastically detach anywhere along the path with a rate, koff = vk\u0303d, where k\u0303d was the detachment rate per unit length along a filament. In addition to stochastic detachments a the cargo walks along a filament, it also could detach with a fixed probability, Pd at filament intersections. A cargo run stopped when it detached from the filament. Cargo was assumed to interact with the intersection when it was closer than one cargo radius (r) to one of the filament intersections. The value of the off rate, k\u0303d and detachment probability at intersections, Pd, were determined from the analysis of run lengths from manual tracking of experimental videos (see Sec 3.2). Finally, the cargo was assumed to detach from filaments when it reached one of the filament ends. In our model, we simulated only cargo transport along the filament and considered only ballistic motion for analysis to compare with experimental tracks. This was different from previous models where diffusive transport of cargo in the cytoplasm was considered [24, 25] in addition to the ballistic phase on filaments. Since our goal was to analyze the impact of network features on transport, which is independent of time, we decided to work with quantities that do not depend on time. Instead, we examined run length, displacement, and MSD as a function of path length to compare with experiments. Thus v in our model was a free parameter that was chosen depending on computational convenience. We performed N=1000 cargo runs for each network."

The experimental networks were extracted to be used for simulations. When the mesh sizes were characterized from simulations using MatLab, they were 37% higher than the experimental characterization on 97% of the networks (Fig. 1F). It is possible that in the extraction, we lost small intersections\nthat were actually there in experiments, resulting in a larger mesh size in simulations. This could result in altered quantitative results from simulations compared to experiments.

            "text": "The run length of a quantum dot cargo is the total distance, or contour length, traveled along the microtubules of the network before detaching. Experimental data was collected and long trajectories were manually tracked, regardless of network mesh size. The run length, s, was determined from the manually tracked trajectories and the data was binned with either 8 \u00b5m or 1 \u00b5m bins (Fig. 3A, blue). We deduced the two parameters that controlled run length via dissociation, namely the off rate for cargoes between intersections, koff , and the probability of detaching at the intersections, Pd, by fitting the run length histograms to exponential decay functions of the form: y = ae\u2212(k\u0303d+Pd/\u03bb)s, where \u03bb is the mean mesh size for all extracted networks, a is an arbitrary normalization parameter, and k\u0303d is the detachment rate per unit length. The parameter k\u0303d is equivalent to the inverse of the \u201cnatural\u201d run length for the cargoes in the absence of intersections and is equal to the off rate between intersections divided by the cargo velocity: koff/v (Fig. 3A, blue).\nBecause we have two unknown parameters, we also need to use a second set of data to deduce the off rate between intersections. Using only the subset of tracks that never visited an intersection during their trajectories, the run lengths were again binned\nand fit to y = ae\u2212(k\u0303d+1/\u03bb)s (Fig. 3A, red). The two histograms had fit parameters of A = k\u0303d + Pd/\u03bb and B = k\u0303d + 1/\u03bb, which were used to deduce k\u0303d and Pd (Table B4).\nThe histogram bin size had an effect on the fitting parameters and hence the values of koff and Pd used for simulations. Histograms with 8 \u00b5m bins resulted in a Pd value of 0.75 and histograms with 1 \u00b5m bins resulted in a Pd value of 0.62. Assuming the distribution of run lengths has this form: ae\u2212(k\u0303d+Pd/\u03bb)s, then the average run length, \u27e8s\u27e9, for a network with a mesh size, \u03bb, should be given by finding the average of this expression given by: \u27e8s\u27e9 = 1/(k\u0303d + Pd/\u03bb). (2) Thus the dependence of the average run length (\u27e8s\u27e9) with mesh size (\u03bb) is non-linear and saturates to 1/k\u0303d for large mesh sizes (Fig. 3B). Given the uncertainty of the estimation of Pd, we can examine the sensitivity of this analytical expression to the value of Pd (Fig. 3B). For small Pd, the run length saturates to the natural run length for cargoes on a single microtubule. When Pd approaches 1, the run lengths are depressed and only reach the natural run length at higher mesh sizes (Fig. 3B). This theoretical equation is general in that it allows us to compute run lengths at any values of motor off rate, mesh size, and detachment probability at intersections. This equation will also allow future experiments to compute the detachment probability at intersections without having to manually filter trajectories that encounter intersections. For the simulations, we used a value of Pd equal to 0.75 and a k\u0303d equal to 0.1.\nWe compared our analytical results to both our experimental quantification of run length and simulations of the run length on our microtubule networks. For the experimental data, we observed that as the mesh size increased, the average run length also increased (Fig. 4Ai,ii). We assigned an artificial cut-off between low mesh size (less than 2 \u00b5m) and high mesh size (larger than 2 \u00b5m). Using this cut-off, we found that the median run length for low mesh size was 3.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m/s and the high mesh size was 3.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m/s (Fig. 4Aii).\nThere was a distinct difference in the statistics for networks with mesh sizes above and below this cut-off (Fig. 4Aii). Indeed, performing the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff statistical test (KS Test), we found the probability was p = 0.0003 or 0.03% that the small and large mesh size results were the same (Fig. 4Aii). Thus, we concluded that the threshold at a mesh size of 2 \u00b5m is a reasonable cut-off between low and high mesh sizes for further comparisons. The experimental run length results implied that quantum dots cover longer distances when the microtubule tracks were more open, with fewer intersections. This result makes sense, since smaller mesh sizes should have more intersections, and kinesin has been shown to have a high probability of terminating a run when contacting a microtubule intersection [5].\nUsing the deduced probabilities for dissociation between or at intersections (Fig. 3A), we were able to simulate trajectories on different networks and quantify the run lengths as a function of mesh size (Fig. 4B). The simulated run lengths increased with increasing mesh size just like the experimental data with a similar slope (Fig. 4Bi). Using the same mesh size cut-off, we compared the simulated run lengths to find the low mesh size median run length was 4.2 \u00b1 0.8 and the high mesh size median run length was 4.8 \u00b1 0.1. These results were significantly different with a probability of 0.0015% that they are the same distribution using the KS Test."

Plotting all together, it is clear that the simulations have systematically longer run lengths than the experimental results. Given the sensitivity to the value of Pd, it is possible that adjusting this parameter or the natural run length, 1/k\u0303d, could cause the difference. Examining the data with multiple values of Pd plotted, we estimate that the probability of detaching at an intersection is between 0.3 and 0.75 for the\nexperimental data and between 0.2 and 0.5 for the simulation data (Fig. 4C). This is a not surprising considering that the extracted networks have larger mesh sizes compared to experiments (Fig. 1). Thus, for the same values of Pd and 1/k\u0303d, the number of intersections encountered is smaller, and the run lengths will thus be larger.\nAnother difference between simulations and experiment could results from track switching at intersections. In our simulations, we did not include track switching as an option at intersections (Table B4) because switching has been shown to be infrequent for kinesin cargoes with one or two motors [5]. Further, in our manual tracking of long trajectories, we only observed switching at intersections with about 5% probability, which matches prior reports for single GFP-kinesin [5]. In order to check if 5% switching probability at intersections could alter the results, we simulated trajectories in the networks including this probability. We found that this small switching probability has no effect on the run lengths we observe in simulations (Appendix Fig. B1), justifying our choice to not include it in the simulations. Further, this also implies that there is likely on average one active motor per quantum dot, although there is a small probability that some quantum dots have two motors."

In our model, the speed v was a free parameter that was chosen depending on computational convenience. Given these assumptions, we would expect that the average and instantaneous velocities should be independent of mesh size. As a rationale check, we calculated the instantaneous speed of the quantum dot cargoes between two time points. We found that there was a shallow trend in the median of the instantaneous speed as a function of average mesh size (Fig. 5A). Using the same threshold at a mesh size of 2 \u00b5m, we found that the two distributions have different medians of 0.052 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b5m/s for the low mesh size and 0.060 \u00b1 0.002 \u00b5m/s for the high mesh size (Fig. 5B). The distribution of instantaneous speeds was wider with a standard deviation of 0.018 \u00b1 0.004 compared to the standard deviation of the high mesh size data, which had a standard deviation 0.010 \u00b1 0.002 (Fig. 5B). This was likely because, at a smaller mesh size, there was a higher probability of a cargo encountering an intersection between two frames and affecting the instantaneous speed. Comparing the data with the KS Test, we found that the distribution in instantaneous velocities for the low and high mesh sizes were not statistically different, with a 5.6% probability that they are the same.\nWe also quantified the average velocity of the cargo trajectories, given by the total run length (Fig. 4) over the total association time. Since the network intersections reduced both the association time and the run length by the same mechanism, specifically causing the dissociation of the cargoes, we expected both parameters to decrease similarly. Indeed, we found that the average speed of the cargoes was unaffected by mesh size, as expected (Fig. 5C). The average speed distributions had medians of 0.82 \u00b1 0.06 for low mesh and 0.80 \u00b1 0.03 for high mesh size (Fig. 5D). The probability that these two distributions are the same is 39% using the KS test (Fig. 5D). These checks indicated that our model assumptions about velocity were reasonable."

Here, we took the approach to characterize the network using the mesh\nsize and examine the effects of the mesh size on the run length, displacement, and mean square displacement of the motion through the network. We found that these parameters are sensitive to mesh size, even over the small range in mesh size that we are able to realize in experiments, 1 \u00b5m to 5 \u00b5m. Despite the small range of mesh sizes, there were significant changes in all the trajectory parameters.\nUsing experimental trajectories, we deduced the parameters for cargo detachment at intersections and between intersections. We used these parameters to create an analytical theory for the average run length as a function of mesh size, which had similar trends as our experimental data and was sensitive to the probability of detaching at intersections.\nUsing the exact same networks extracted from the experimental data and the off rates, we were able to simulate cargo trajectories through the networks. The simulation data had the same trends and similar quantitative results as the experiments for run length, displacement, and mean squared displacement for real cargoes assembled with kinesin motors. We anticipate that future work with different mesh sizes, filament organizations, and motor types will be modeled with the same fundamental principles we uncover here. Specifically, we anticipate that other motors would have different reactions to intersections and composite motor systems would further increase complexity.\nAcknowledgments.
