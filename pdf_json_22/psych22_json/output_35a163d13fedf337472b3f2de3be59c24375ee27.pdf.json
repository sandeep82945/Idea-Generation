A narrative review on the population-based data on suicide rates suggested an escalating trend since Summer 2020, after an initial stability of the phenomenon. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic SB showed a 35% increase and suicides rates escalated after a initial stability. School closures might be involved, representing an initial protective factor for suicidality, while after the reopenings we could have assisted to a suicide rebound, especially among the most vulnerable young people. Key messages: The topic of suicidality among young people is still affected\nby a cultural stigma that hampers the development of both academic research, early detection and preventive policies. The increase in suicidal behaviors among youths after the COVID-19 outbreak highlights a major public health issue that requires adequate supporting policies to control and prevent this phenomenon.\nAbstract citation ID: ckac131.493 Project SELfit: training socio-emotional skills in a school environment in Porto\nFilipa Malcata\nF Malcata1, A Rodrigues2, A Machado1, MT Saraiva1, D Antunes1 1Public Health Unit, ACES Porto Ocidental, Porto, Portugal 2Catholic University of Portugal, Braga Region Centre, Braga, Portugal Contact: filipamalcata@hotmail.com"

            "text": "Mental disorders are the main cause of years lived with disability (YLD) in 5-14-year-old people around the world, in Western Europe, and particularly in Portugal. Young people who experience anxiety during childhood have a 3,5-fold likelihood of suffering from depression or anxiety during adulthood. COVID-19 has aggravated this situation, namely regarding socio-emotional competencies. Description of the problem: SELfit, a project based on the Socio-emotional learning (SEL) methodology, aims promoting mental health, by training teachers and community nurses to develop socio-emotional skills in students from primary schools. The project includes a theoretical and a practical/training session, and monthly supervision sessions by a team that includes a psychologist, a public health doctor and public health nurses. The period of implementation is between February to July 2022. Results: A total of 8 community nurses and 13 teachers from 3 primary schools in Porto enrolled in this project, which corresponds to a total around 272 students from 5 to 8-year-old. Knowledge of nurses and teachers regarding mental health literacy, and social emotional learning was assessed, before and after the theoretical session. The mean percentage of correct answers before was 49% (54% regarding nurses and 45% teachers) compared to 84% (92% regarding nurses and 78% teachers) after. Concerning socio-emotional skills of the primary school students, possible improvement will be evaluated at the end of the project (July 2022). Lessons: Mental health literacy and social emotional learning knowledge increased 35%, which highlights the importance of these theoretical sessions promoting mental health literacy. By the end of this project, it is expected to exist an improvement on socio-emotional skills of the primary school students. This is a very important project, expected to be implement and replicated in other schools in Porto and in Portugal. Key messages: Mental disorders are the main cause of years lost due to\ndisability (YLD) in primary school students in Portugal; hence, it was chosen for this mental health promotion project.\nThis is a pioneer project in Porto, involving both community nurses and primary teachers, in which all are involved in training and promoting social-emotional learning in a school context.\nAbstract citation ID: ckac131.494 Stress, anxiety, and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kosovo\nFatime Arenliu Qosaj\nF Arenliu Qosaj1, S Merrill Weine2, P Sejdiu3,4, F Hasani5,6,7, S Statovci8, V Behluli9, A Arenliu10 1Master Program in Healthcare Management, College AAB, Prishtina, Kosovo 2Center for Global Health, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA 3Professional Services Department, Kosovo Medical Chamber, Prishtina, Kosovo 4Orthopedic Clinic, Kosovo Hospital University Clinical Services, Prishtina, Kosovo 5Nursing Department, Alma Mater Europaea, Campus College Rezonanca, Prishtina, Kosovo 6Professional Services Department, Kosovo Nursing Chamber, Prishtina, Kosovo 7Nursing Division, Ministry of Health, Government of the Republic of Kosovo, Prishtina, Kosovo 8Psychiatry Clinic, Kosovo Hospital University Clinical Services, Prishtina, Kosovo 9Professional Services Department, Kosovo Association of Psychologists, Prishtina, Kosovo 10Department of Psychology, Prishtina University, Prishtina, Kosovo Contact: fatime.qosaj@universitetiaab.com"

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has created a very large workload burden on health systems worldwide, Kosovo is no exception to this trend. A pandemic may have a negative impact on health care workers\u2019 (HCWs) mental health. In this crosssectional study, we assessed the self-reported prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression and identified their predictive factors among HCWs in Kosovo. Methods: Data were collected on sociodemographics (sex, age, occupation, education, workplace) and the presence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress through the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) online questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and linear logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: Of the 545 respondents, the majority were male (53.0%), under 60 years of age (94.7%), and married (81.7%). Most of them were physicians (78.2%), while the remaining respondents were nurses, midwives, and other health professionals (22%). The prevalence rates for moderate to extremely high levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were 21.9%, 13.0%, and 13.9%, respectively. Nurses reported significantly higher mean scores for depression and anxiety than physicians (P < 0.05). Being married, having poor health, not exercising, and reporting \u2018burnout\u2019 from work significantly predicted higher levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms among health workers (P < 0.05). Conclusions: HCWs require specific national mental health intervention programs that will, among other effects, help raise awareness of the early recognition of symptoms related to stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout due to workload as well as the importance of regular physical exercise. These programs should be part of the national emergency preparedness, emergency response, and health sector strategy, aiming to build and sustain a resilient health system. Key messages: During COVID-19 pandemic, certain factors predicted\nhigher levels of mental health burden among HCWs. Addressing these factors require policy recommendations with concrete systemic interventions.\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurpub/article/32/Supplem ent_3/ckac131.494/6766824 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 16 January 2024"
