    "abstractText": "Optical chaos is vital for various applications such as private communication, encryption, anti-interference sensing, and reinforcement learning. Chaotic microcombs have emerged as promising sources for generating massive optical chaos. However, their inter-channel correlation behavior remains elusive, limiting their potential for on-chip parallel chaotic systems with high throughput. In this study,wepresentmassively parallel chaos basedon chaotic microcombs and high-nonlinearity AlGaAsOI platforms. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating parallel chaotic signals with inter-channel correlation <0.04 and a high random number generation rate of 3.84 Tbps. We further show the application of our approach by demonstrating a 15-channel integrated random bit generator with a 20Gbps channel rate using silicon photonic chips. Additionally, we achieved a scalable decision-making accelerator for up to 256-armed bandit problems. Our work opens new possibilities for chaos-based information processing systems using integrated photonics, and potentially can revolutionize the current architecture of communication, sensing and computations.",

Chaotic microcombs have emerged as promising sources for generating massive optical chaos. However, their inter-channel correlation behavior remains elusive, limiting their potential for on-chip parallel chaotic systems with high throughput. In this study,wepresentmassively parallel chaos basedon chaotic microcombs and high-nonlinearity AlGaAsOI platforms. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating parallel chaotic signals with inter-channel correlation <0.04 and a high random number generation rate of 3.84 Tbps. We further show the application of our approach by demonstrating a 15-channel integrated random bit generator with a 20Gbps channel rate using silicon photonic chips. Additionally, we achieved a scalable decision-making accelerator for up to 256-armed bandit problems. Our work opens new possibilities for chaos-based information processing systems using integrated photonics, and potentially can revolutionize the current architecture of communication, sensing and computations.\nChaos is a fundamental phenomenon in physics that exhibits random behaviors due to its great sensitivity to small changes of conditions1. It has been playing key roles behind a wide range of applications for modern society: in communications, the generation of chaos guarantees the integrity of cryptographic protocols for secure networks2\u20135; in computations, the simulation of Monte Carlo problems and reinforcement learning relies on random numbers6 generated from chaos, which is particularly essential for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recently, chaos has also been used to enable advanced sensing technologies, such as Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar7,8 or Random Modulation Continuous Wave (RMCW) lidar9\u201311, which are immune to interference and thus can overcome the time/frequency congestion in ranging. Conventionally, the chaotic source used in information systems is generated from the electronic chaos (Fig. 1a1) induced by nonlinear circuits12,13 such as application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and field programmable gate array (FPGA)14,15. Despite their integration compatibility with CMOS electronics, these chaotic sources suffer from lowbandwidth (on the order of hundreds ofMHz12) and the combination of several sources is necessary for high throughput rate, which is well behind the electronic processing speed and therefore lagging the system performance. This problem gets further highlighted in nowadays parallel information architectures, where\nReceived: 5 December 2022\nAccepted: 14 July 2023\nCheck for updates\n1State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communications System and Networks, School of Electronics, Peking University, 100871 Beijing, China. 2Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240 Shanghai, China. 3State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100083Beijing, China. 4Center ofMaterials Science andOptoelectronics Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049Beijing, China. 5Peking University Yangtze Delta Institute of Optoelectronics, 226010Nantong, China. 6PengCheng Laboratory, 518055 Shenzhen, China. 7Frontiers Science Center for Nano-optoelectronics, Peking University, 100871 Beijing, China. 8These authors contributed equally: Bitao Shen, Haowen Shu. e-mail: haowenshu@pku.edu.cn; linchang@pku.edu.cn; xjwang@pku.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4590 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nmultiple data channels need to be proceeded simultaneously for high system throughput.\nOptical chaos16\u201320 has been studied for decades to overcome the limitations of electronic approaches, by utilizing the ultra-fast nature of optical processes (Figs. 1a, 2\u20133). Chaotic lasers21\u201323 have been widely used for this purpose, by perturbing the laser cavities with external injection or optical feedback24, which leads to highly nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior. Chaotic lasers have achieved up to 50GHz25 chaotic bandwidth, surpassing electronic approaches. However, the integration and parallelization of chaotic lasers have encountered remarkable challenges. Multi-wavelength lasers often exhibit high correlation between different wavelengths due to the competition between longitudinal modes26, making chaotic lasers single-channel27 devices. Previously, parallelization relied on incompatible spatial multiplexing16,28 or laser arrays29,30. Moreover, the requirement for strict injection or feedback configurations complicates miniaturization and widespread usage. These limitations hinder the practical deployment of optical chaos30.\nThe use of a chaotic comb (Figs. 1a, 4 as a parallel chaotic source offers a promising alternative, as spatiotemporal chaos can be achieved by pumping an optical nonlinear microcavity with sufficient power. In frequency domain, the comb is consisted of well-separated comb lines, each exhibiting poor coherence31\u201333. This promises tremendous parallelism provided by optics through wavelength-divisionmultiplexing technology. Recently, chaotic combs have been employed as parallel optical sources for optical coherence tomography34,35 and parallel ranging11. Especially for parallel ranging, the chaotic properties of chaotic combs were harnessed for unambiguous and interference-free Lidar with simplified systems11,36.\nHowever, the parallelization inpreviousworkswasbasedon frequency domain rather than on the chaotic signal carried by each channel. For parallel chaotic sources, channels should be uncorrelated with each other, which is vital to applications ranging from private communication4,37 and key distribution5 to chaotic lidar/radar systems7,36. However, it is still unclear whether chaotic combs can function as parallel chaotic sources.\nIn this work, we fill this gap by providing a full investigation of chaotic comb lines, and introduce the optical chaotic comb as a massively parallel chaotic source with low inter-channel correlation as shown in Fig. 1b. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we verified inter-channel orthogonality relation between each tooth of a chaotic microcomb in both theory and experiment, which demonstrated its parallelization capability. By using an advanced heterogeneous photonic platform, aluminium gallium arsenide on insulator (AlGaAsOI) on silicon substrate38,39, we demonstrate a massively parallelized chaotic source with hundreds of wavelength channels on chip, that is compatible with current photonic foundry production. Based on this capability, we explore two advanced applications. A 15-channel random number generation system with 20Gbps bit channel rate is achieved using silicon photonic WDM and receivers, whose aggregate rate is one order of magnitude higher than previous on-chip random number generators.

            "text": "Properties of massively parallel chaotic combs Firstly, we verify the ability of microcombs in chaotic states to act as massively parallel chaotic sources. Chaotic bandwidth is one of the key metrics of chaos and Fig. 2c shows the radio frequency spectra of chaotic combs under different pump powers. Due to the high nonlinear effect, a chaotic comb with \u223cGHz bandwidth is reachable with tens of mW pump power. The bandwidth of the chaotic signal broadens with a stronger pump. As the on-chip pump power reaches 130mW, the chaotic comb shows a broad radio frequency noise with a 10 dB-bandwidth of up to 5.6GHz. The bandwidth is currently limited by the free-carrier-absorption (FCA) and the three-photon-absorption (3PA) in the AlGaAsOI waveguide, as discussed in the Supplementary Note 8. Nonetheless, the bandwidth is already compatible with that of the optical-feedback chaotic laser. In addition, the broad chaos, starting from the very low-frequency baseband, holds consecutively\nstrong components within its noise band, which is power-efficient for radio applications considering a low-pass response in the optical receiver for RF signal generation7.\nTo characterize the intra- and inter-channel chaotic properties (see Supplementary Note 1), each comb line is filtered out from a chaotic microcomb with 130mW pump power (Fig. 2a). The comb is rendered as the trapezoidal shape in log scale, with an approximate power variation of 7 dB within the C band. Before each filtered comb line is sent into the photodetector and afterward recorded, the pump mode is suppressed and the remaining signals are amplified together, as shown in Fig. 2b. The time domain signal of a comb line is depicted in Fig. 2d. Due to the intracavity field undergoing the spatiotemporal chaos, the amplitude of the comb line changes rapidly and intensely, totally different from the caseof the localized comb state. The extreme events are also captured in the amplitudedistribution (Fig. 2e), where a long tail exists at high intensity. The quality of the chaotic signal is valued by the autocorrelation function (ACF) in Fig. 2f. The ACFs of the 51 comb lines possess a Dirac-like shape. Without the need for a feedback loop to estimate a chaotic state as the chaotic laser, no time delayed signature is observed in the ACF of chaotic combs.

Figure 2g shows the FWHMof the ACF changes with the detuning. Due to the self-locking induced by the intracavity thermal effect39,40, the FWHM for all comb lines can be maintained within 0.2 ns for a detuning range larger than 25GHz, indicating remarkable stability and inter-channel consistency.\nDespite the simultaneous generation of multi high-quality chaotic signals demonstrated above, the chaotic comb cannot be employed as a parallel chaotic source unless channels are orthogonal to each other. The orthogonality is quantified by the correlation between channels. In our experiment, we examine the inter-channel correlation by filtering and detecting every two comb lines simultaneously. The correlation of each pair of comb lines in the C band is shown in Fig. 2h. Because the pump mode is suppressed, the correlation between the pumpmode and others is not presented here. Two significant lines with relatively strong correlations can be observed. One is the main diagonal, which is autocorrelation. The other is\nsymmetric with respect to the pump mode, indicating an obvious correlation between symmetrical comb lines. The correlation between symmetrical comb lines is also captured in our simulation based on the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE), shown in Fig. 2i and Supplementary Note 4. As the energy to stimulate comb lines is originated from the intracavity pump laser, the symmetrical comb lines should be naturally correlated with each other due to the four-wavemixing process. Except for the symmetrical modes, the correlation between comb lines is lower than 0.04, which is low enough for applications requiring parallel chaotic sources7,36,37,41.\nHundreds of channels, the uniform power distribution, the negligible cross-correlation between different channels, and the comparable chaotic bandwidthwith chaotic lasers, all theseproperties suggest the chaotic comb is an attractive massively parallel chaotic source. In addition, different from its localized partner, the soliton comb, the chaotic comb can be generated in a simple and distinct manner, by slowly sweeping into a high-quality optical nonlinear microcavity without the blocking of the intracavity thermal effect. More attractively, the intracavity thermal effect can facilitate the stabilization of the chaotic state39,40.\nIn pu\nt\nGe-Si PD\nAWG\n200 \u03bcm\nCH2CH1 CH3 CH4 CH5 CH6 CH7 CH8 CH9 CH10 CH11 CH12 CH13 CH14 CH15 CH16\nChannel number\nPass rate (%)Pass rate (%) 99 98100\n5 10 15 Channel number 5 10 15\nNumber of delayed bits3 LSBs\nDifferential intensity\nPr ob\nav ilit\ny de\nns ity\nPr ob\nav ilit\ny de\nns ity\n0 140 160 18060 80 100 1204020 200\n20 25 30\nFrequency Block frequency\nCumulative sums Runs\nLongest run Rank FFT\nNonoverlapping template Overlapping template\nUniversal Approximate entropy Random excursions\nSerial Linear complexity\nRandom excursions variant\nC or\nre la\ntio n\n(a rb\n.u ni\nts )\n10-5\n10-4\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n0.05\n0\n0.10\n0.15\n99 98 97 96100\n00 0 00 1 01 0 01 1 10 0 10 1 11 0 11 1\na\nd\ng h\ne f\nb cGe-Si PD\nAWG\nSOI receiver 3-LSB\nXOR D \u0394I DOSC\nOffline process\nParallel chaotic source\nParallel chaotic source\nParallel chaotic source\nBPF EDFA\nPD\nOffline process\nOSC\nCalculated correlation Lower limit\nFig. 3 | The parallel randombit generator based on amicroresonator and a SOI chip. a Optical microscope photograph of the SiPh receiver. b The set-up scheme for parallel random number generation; AWG arrayed waveguide grating, PD photodetector, OSC oscillator, D delay unit, XOR exclusive-OR, BPF band-pass filter, EDFA erbium-doped fiber amplifier. c The setup for random bit generation\nusing two chaotic combs. d The possibility distribution function of the differential data. e The distribution of the extracted 3 LSBs. f The ACF of the generated bit sequence.

Figure 3b shows the detection scheme using the SiPh receiver. Before injection into the SiPh chip, the chaotic comb output from the microring chip passes a FBG to suppress the pump mode and is amplified by a commercial DWDM EDFA. To compensate for the insertion loss of the SiPh chip, one selected comb line is filtered and amplified before injection into the SiPh chip. The SiPh chip is constituted of a 16-channel arrayed wavelength grating (AWG) and arrayed Ge-Si photodetectors. The average channel spacing of the AWG is about 180GHz, fitted with the 2 FSR of the chaotic comb. The selected comb line is selectively coupled into one PD passing the AWG. The signal detected by the Ge-Si PD is sent to the oscilloscope, recorded at the sampling rate of 20 GSa/s.\nEnsuring the relatively low correlation between adjacent sampled data, the recorded data is down-sampled to 6.67GSa/s. As shown in Fig. 2e, the intensity distribution of the output I shows an asymmetric shape. To symmetrize the distribution, a delay difference is employed to the raw data, obtaining \u0394Iwith a symmetric distribution as shown in Fig. 3d. The symmetric distribution is favorable for unbiased bit extraction42. The differential data \u0394I is digitalized to 8 bits and the 3 least significant bits (LSB) are used for random bit generation. A normal distribution of the extracted 3 LSBs (see Fig. 3e) indicates that the generated bit sequence contains different bit patterns with equal frequencies. Then a self-delayed exclusive-OR (XOR) process is employed to remove the residual bias as shown inFig. 3b. Figure3f shows theACF of the generated bit sequence and the correlation is around the lower limit 1/ ffiffiffi n p , where n = 106 is the length of bit sequence. A strict test of the generated random bits is carried out by the NIST SP 800-22, a standard statistical test suite. As shown in Fig. 3g, all of the 15 channels obtain pass rates >96.5%, within the acceptance range for the NIST SP 800-22 test. The generated random bits also pass the Diehard test successfully, shown in Supplementary Note 11.\nThe generation rate of single chaotic comb is mainly limited by the chaotic bandwidth, which is degenerated by the nonlinear absorption. To compensate this, here we provide a method by a dualcomb scheme. The schematic is shown is Fig. 3c, where two combs are pumped by two lasers with a frequency difference around 4GHz. In experiment, two microcavities are packaged with temperature\ncontrollers and the chaotic combs are generated by sweeping the resonant frequency by tuning the chip temperature, while the pump lasers are kept fixed. The comb teeth of the two chaotic combs are filtered, amplified and combined, before being sent to the photodiode. The time domain waveforms of each tooth pairs are recorded at a sampling rate of 80GSa/s. The rawdata aredown-sampling to40GSa/s and processed as described above. In this case, the single channel generation rate can be increased to 120Gbps, which is comparable to the random bit generator based on chaotic lasers. 32 channels on the same side of the pump mode are recorded, processed, and successfully pass the NIST SP 800-22 test (see in Fig. 3h), corresponding to an aggregation rate of 3.84 Tbps.\nIn Table 1, we present a comparation of different random bit generation schemes. Due to the massively parallelism provided by chaotic combs, the total bit rate of chaotic-comb-basedRBG shows the highest generation rate among optical-chaos-based methods. As the lack of data in published articles, the power consumption is not listed in Table 1. Considering simple setup with one pump laser and one microcavity, the generation of optical chaotic sources based on chaotic combs is power-efficient and low-cost compared with chaotic lasers43,44, which require at least one laser diode per channel. In addition, our work gives the demonstration of parallel chaotic signal detection employing the integrated SiPh chip. Although the generation rate of chaotic-comb-based RBG is lower than ASE (amplified spontaneous emission)-based RBG with spectral or spatial parallelism, the use of chaotic systems offers the ability to synchronize the output of two chaos generators4,37, which has been well studied for chaotic lasers2,5 but not demonstrated yet for chaotic combs. The synchronized systems can be arranged at the transmitter and receiver sides respectively. This synchronization enables key distribution and private communication, which is not possible with stochastic sources such as ASE and random lasers.\nComputation acceleration based on chaotic combs Optical chaos, with its fast and complex internal time evolution, is a powerful entropy source that can be used for exploration purposes45. Chaotic lasers have been successfully employed to solve the multiarmed bandit problem (MAB)29,46,47, a fundamental problem of reinforcement learning. To scale up the problem exponentially, a parallel scheme is required that employs parallel chaotic signals or is based on time-division-multiplexing48. In this section, we propose the use of the\nchaotic comb as a massively parallel chaotic source to solve the MAB. Figure 4a shows the schematic of the optical decision making. There are N slot machines with a reward possibility pi(i = 0 \u223c N \u2212 1) respectively. The decision maker needs to find out the slot machine with the highest reward possibility by consecutively playing the slot machines. For each play, the decisionmaker chooses and plays one slotmachine. Thedecisionmakerwill change its selection strategy basedonwhether a reward is obtained. In the decision maker, N chaotic signals \u0394Ii(t) (i =0, 1, 2, 3) are detected and add with bias values Bi(t) respectively to produce Ai(t). Each channel is correlated with one slot machine. For each play, the slot machine with the highest biased signal Ai(t) is selected and played. As continuously playing the game, bias values will be tuned based on tug-of-war method47 (see Methods).\nIn experiment, we detect 32 channels at the short-wavelength side of the pump mode one by one, to solve the 32-armed bandit problem. The hit probabilities of the 32 slots are set as follows: P1 =0.7, P2=0.5, P3 =0.9, P4 =0.1,\u2026, P2j\u22121=0.7 and P2j =0.5. As shown in Fig. 4b, the chaos-based decision maker would initially explore a wide range to identify the slotmachinewith thehighest hit probability. After sufficient exploration, the slot machine 3 is identified as the best one and frequently selected, indicating successful decisionmaking. To evaluate the performance of the decision making based on chaotic combs, the slot machines are played C = 1000 cycles consecutively, and this process is repeated T = 1000 times. For t-cycle, the correct decision ratio (CDR) is defined as Thit/T, where Thit represents the number of times a reward is obtained at the t-th cycle among the T processes. A CDR above 95% is viewed as a successful decision and the first cycle getting a CDR>95% is defined as the convergence cycle (CC). Figure 4c shows the CDR evolution along with the increase of cycles. Under the same system condition, the CDR evolution remains consistent across different Ntarget, which represent the number of the slot with the highest hit probability.\nThe scalability is a critical characteristic of the decision maker, where the convergence cycle will exponentially increase as the rise of problem scales. To assess the ability of solving large scale problems, we use the chaotic comb to solve the MBA problems with the number of slot machines N =4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. Limited by the gain bandwidth and the spectrum width of the chaotic comb, the number of\navailable channels is 32. For N > 32, we record the 32 channels repeatedly to obtain enough channels of chaotic signals. As shown in Fig. 4d, the chaotic-comb-based decision marker can solve the MBA problems even with a large scale. Figure 4e gives the performance comparation between chaotic-comb-based decision marker and other methods47. Fitted with the power function, the relationship between the convergence cycle CC and the number of slot machines N can be described asCC= 26.48\u2219N0.89. Comparedwithwidely-usedalgorithmsuchasUCB1tuned (upper confidence bound 1-tuned) algorithm and Thompson sampling algorithm, methods based on optical-chaos show smaller scaling exponents, suitable for large-scale problems. Among the optical chaos, the decision maker shows a superb convergence speed, close to the spatial-chaos basedmethod.While comparedwith the spatial chaos system, the chaotic microcomb benefits from integrated optoelectronics, providing a compact, low-cost, mass-producible decision marker. Despite having fewer channels compared to the spatial chaos system47, the chaotic comb feathers high generation rate (40 GSa/s employed here for decision making) and the adoption of timemultiplexing48 can be a promising approach to scale up the system, even though it may result in a tradeoff between speed and scalability."

            "text": "The bandwidth and the parallelization capability demonstrated here canbe further improvedby optimizing the design aswell as fabrication for the microresonator. Currently the microresonator in this work is critically coupled, and by using an over-coupled structure instead, higher conversion efficiency, wider optical spectrumandhigher power per comb line could be obtained without degenerating the chaotic properties. Another factor which limits the chaotic bandwidth currently is the intra-cavity nonlinear loss49,50 (discussed in Supplementary Note 8), which mainly comes from the three photon absorption and consequently free carrier absorption, leading to relatively high side lobes. This can be solved by employing an integrated PIN structure for the waveguide or working at a longer-wavelength band51. Combining these strategies, combs with chaotic bandwidth above 10GHz can be expected with 100mW pump powers. Furthermore, the spectral coverage of the comb can be further extended through dispersion\nscalability between chaotic-comb-based decision maker and other methods.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4590 6\nengineering, accessing much more chaotic comb channels than those at C band in this work. By combining all these strategies, a parallel random number generator with beyond 3 Tbps total rate can be achieved, by using only one comb source (detailed discussions can be found in Supplementary Note 6 and 10), which is even better than the best benchtop chaotic system.\nOne key advantage of our approach is the scalability. The AlGaAsOI platform is fabricated by heterogeneous integration on Si substrate52, and thus is compatiblewith themost widely used platform of silicon photonics53\u201355. Such integration has recently been demonstrated56, suggesting that our chaotic microcomb can be seamlessly implemented in fully integrated photonic systems, together with diverse silicon photonic engines such as optical I/O, optical computation57,58 unit or optical phase array for sensing59. Other materials, such as silicon nitride60, hydex61,62 or lithium niobite63, can also beused for realizing chaoticmicrocombs, and potentially can also be integrated with silicon photonics.\nBesides the applications we showed in this work, the parallel chaotic sources can also benefit many other applications. It can be used to generate chaotic signals forMIMO radar7,8/LiDAR9\u201311, whichwill lead tohigher resolutiondue to the large bandwidth andhigher energy efficiency. One great advantage of the chaotic microcomb, compared withpreviouswidelyused electronic chaotic source, is the capability of directly generating optical signals. Its output thus can be transmitted over long distance for communications, or emitted directly to freespace for sensing. As a result, this integrated,massively parallel chaotic source holds the promise to rewrite the paradigm of information technologies in the future."

The biased value Ai is calculated based on\nAi t\u00f0 \u00de=\u0394Ii t\u00f0 \u00de+ kBi t\u00f0 \u00de \u00f03\u00de\nBi is the bias, which is tuned based on the estimated hit probabilities P\u0302i, given by:\nBi t\u00f0 \u00de=Qi t\u00f0 \u00de 1 N 1 XN i0\u2260i Qi0 \u00f0t\u00de\nQi t\u00f0 \u00de=\u0394Wi P\u0302top1 + P\u0302top2 Li\n\u0394=2 \u00f0P\u0302top1 + P\u0302top2\u00de P\u0302i = Wi Ti\n\u00f04\u00de\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4590 7\nWhereTi is the time that the slotmachine i is selected,Wi (Li) is the time of win (loss) as selecting slot machine i. P\u0302top1 and P\u0302top2 are the highest and second highest estimated hit probabilities. All parameters above are determined by the game process, except for k. The value of k is tuned to obtain the balance between exploration and convergence. The decision process will converge fast under a large k, where a large bias is obtained after a fewcycles, and vice versa. ForN = 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, k is set to 0.11, 0.17, 0.23, 0.33, 0.48, 0.58, 0.67 respectively, determined by sweep the k value\nunder different N as illustrated in Supplement note 13."

The pump filed is coupled into the cavity by ffiffiffi \u03b8 p Ein, where \u03b8 is the waveguide coupling coefficient and Ein is the pump field. \u03b22 represents the second-order dispersion coefficients.
