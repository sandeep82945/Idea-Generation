    "abstractText": "Adsorption\u2010based atmospheric water harvesting has emerged as a compelling solution in response to growing global water demand. In this context, Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered considerable interest due to their unique structure and intrinsic porosity. Here, MOF 801 was synthesized using two different methods: solvothermal and green room temperature synthesis. Comprehensive characterization indicated the formation of MOF\u2010801 with high phase purity, small crystallite size, and excellent thermal stability. Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption analysis revealed that green\u2010synthesized MOF\u2010801 possessed an 89% higher specific surface area than its solvothermal\u2010 synthesized counterpart. Both adsorbents required activation at a minimum temperature of 90 \u00b0C for optimal adsorption performance. Additionally, green\u2010synthesized MOF\u2010801 demonstrated superior adsorption performance compared to solvothermal\u2010synthesized MOF\u2010801, attributed to its small crystal size (around 66 nm), more hydrophilic functional groups, greater specific surface area (691.05 m2/g), and the possibility of having a higher quantity of defects. The maximum water adsorption capacity in green\u2010synthesized MOF\u2010801 was observed at 25 \u00b0C and 80% relative humidity, with a value of 41.1 g/100 g, a 12% improvement over the solvothermal\u2010synthesized MOF\u2010801. Remarkably, even at a 30% humidity level, green\u2010synthesized MOF\u2010801 displayed a considerable adsorption capacity of 31.5 g/100 g. Importantly, MOF\u2010801 exhibited long\u2010term effectiveness in multiple adsorption cycles without substantial efficiency decline.",

            "text": "Adsorption\u2011based atmospheric water harvesting has emerged as a compelling solution in response to growing global water demand. In this context, Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered considerable interest due to their unique structure and intrinsic porosity. Here, MOF 801 was synthesized using two different methods: solvothermal and green room temperature synthesis. Comprehensive characterization indicated the formation of MOF\u2011801 with high phase purity, small crystallite size, and excellent thermal stability. Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption analysis revealed that green\u2011synthesized MOF\u2011801 possessed an 89% higher specific surface area than its solvothermal\u2011 synthesized counterpart. Both adsorbents required activation at a minimum temperature of 90 \u00b0C for optimal adsorption performance. Additionally, green\u2011synthesized MOF\u2011801 demonstrated superior adsorption performance compared to solvothermal\u2011synthesized MOF\u2011801, attributed to its small crystal size (around 66 nm), more hydrophilic functional groups, greater specific surface area (691.05 m2/g), and the possibility of having a higher quantity of defects. The maximum water adsorption capacity in green\u2011synthesized MOF\u2011801 was observed at 25 \u00b0C and 80% relative humidity, with a value of 41.1 g/100 g, a 12% improvement over the solvothermal\u2011synthesized MOF\u2011801. Remarkably, even at a 30% humidity level, green\u2011synthesized MOF\u2011801 displayed a considerable adsorption capacity of 31.5 g/100 g. Importantly, MOF\u2011801 exhibited long\u2011term effectiveness in multiple adsorption cycles without substantial efficiency decline.\nCurrently, freshwater scarcity stands as one of humanity\u2019s most pressing concerns. It is expected that water stress will worsen in the near future, particularly for individuals residing in dry areas1,2. Only a minor fraction, approximately 2.5%, of the global water supply is freshwater, while the overwhelming majority, around 97.5%, is saltwater in oceans. Out of the freshwater sources, only 0.4% is easily accessible and available for use3,4. Worldwide, research efforts have been taken to harvest water, including rainwater collection, groundwater harvesting, and water desalination. However, these methods heavily rely on the presence of liquid water sources and face significant limitations in regions that are landlocked5,6. It is a well-established fact that freshwater on Earth also includes water vapor present in the atmosphere, amounting to a total of 15 trillion liters7,8. Surprisingly, even in landlocked regions, a significant amount of water vapor exists. The atmospheric water generation technique not only presents labor and energy saving but also demonstrates its applicability across vast areas on Earth9\u201312. Furthermore, the harvested water by this method is suitable for drinking without the need for complex sterilization processes7,13. Typically, there are three main approaches to achieving atmospheric water generation: fog collection, cooling air to a temperature below the dew point, and employing sorbents to assist in water harvesting14,15. However, the first two methods face significant restrictions due to specific geographical or climatic conditions. As a result, considerable research efforts have been dedicated to investigating sorbent-assisted water capture16,17.\nIn recent years, there has been significant interest in a newly developed category of adsorbent materials known as \"metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs)\"18,19. MOFs are a unique class of crystalline porous materials composed\nOPEN"

While MOFs have attracted considerable attention for various applications such as photocatalysis22, separation techniques23,24, electro-catalysis25, biomedical imaging26, drug delivery27, electronic and gas sensors28,29, researchers have recently begun exploring their potential as adsorbents for capturing water due to their exceptional porosity and expansive surface area30. MOFs designed for atmospheric water harvesting can be categorized into three main groups: (1) those based on aluminum, including MOF-303, CAU-10, and MIL-53; (2) zirconium-based MOFs, such as MOF-801, MOF-808, and MOF-841; and (3) other types like MIL-101 and Co2Cl2(BTDD)31. Among the MOFs, MOF-801, MOF808, and MOF-841, stand out for their exceptional water adsorption capacity. They are notable for their ease of regeneration at temperatures below 150\u00a0\u00b0C. Even after five cycles of adsorption and desorption, these materials retained their water adsorption capabilities32. MOF-801 [ Zr6O4(OH)4(fumarate)6] is a highly researched material in this category due to its several advantages such as its low cost and exceptional stability. Additionally, MOF801 possesses three distinct cavities providing the ability to capture and concentrate water molecules within them33\u201336. It has been previously reported that MOF-801 exhibits excellent water adsorption performance even in regions with low humidity4. Kim et\u00a0al. demonstrated a remarkable water adsorption capacity of ~ 25\u00a0g/100\u00a0g by utilizing MOF-801 at a low relative humidity of 20%37. In another study, Yaghi et\u00a0al. demonstrated a maximum adsorption capacity of 22.5\u00a0g/100\u00a0g for MOF-801 at 10% RH18. The same research group designed a water harvesting device based on MOF-801, which is capable of collecting 2.8 L of water per kilogram of adsorbent per day at 20% RH without requiring any additional energy input38. In another study, Mi et\u00a0al. suggested a way for synthesizing defective MOF-801 which results in an exceptional level of water harvesting efficiency (1.60\u00a0kg water/kg adsorbent/day at 20% RH)39.\nDespite the numerous studies conducted on the application of Zr-based MOFs for water harvesting, a comprehensive investigation that thoroughly assesses the effect of surface characteristics and environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity level on the water harvesting performance of MOF-801 is noticeably lacking. Moreover, there is a scarcity of research that specifically examines the optimum activation temperature and water adsorption rate of MOF-801. Additionally, existing research in this domain have not sufficiently explored the morphology, structure, and adsorption performance of MOF-801 after undergoing multiple and prolonged cycles. To overcome the mentioned lack of information, in this study, MOF-801 was synthesized as a water adsorbent using two different methods: (1) solvothermal method with DMF as the solvent, and (2) room temperature green-synthesis with water as the solvent. The synthesized samples were compared in terms of their characteristics, morphology, and structure. Subsequently, the optimum activation temperature of MOF-801 was investigated to determine the temperature at which all adsorbed water is desorbed, resulting in complete water removal. The performance of the adsorbents was then examined under various temperature and humidity conditions. Additionally, the adsorption rate in MOF-801 was studied to assess its performance within a specific time frame. Finally, the characteristics, adsorption performance, and stability of MOF-801 over multiple adsorption cycles were discussed, to evaluate its efficiency for repeated use."

It is noteworthy that all the materials were used without any additional treatment.\nSolvothermal\u2011synthesized MOF\u2011801 In the first method (solvothermal synthesis), MOF-801 was synthesized according to the synthesis procedure described by Yaghi and co-workers40 as follows: Firstly, in a screw-capped jar, 1.24\u00a0g fumaric acid and 3.42\u00a0g ZrO Cl2 \u00b78 H2 O were dissolved in a solvent mixture consisting of 42.8\u00a0mL of DMF and 14.98\u00a0mL of formic acid under magnetic stirring. The resulting solution was then transferred into an autoclave and heated at 130\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0h. The white product was filtrated and washed three times with 50\u00a0mL of DMF over a period of 3 days. The washed particles were dried overnight at ambient temperature, followed by another round of three daily washes with 50\u00a0mL of methanol for 3 days and subsequently dried in air again. Finally activated MOF-801 was obtained by drying the white solid at 150\u00a0\u00b0C under vacuum for 24\u00a0h. For the sake of naming convenience, during this study, the solvothermal-synthesized MOF-801 is named SS-MOF-801.\nGreen\u2011synthesized MOF\u2011801 The second method (green room temperature synthesis) used water instead of DMF as the solvent to synthesize MOF-801 according to the previous report41,42. In this case, 3.5\u00a0g ZrO Cl2 \u00b78 H2 O was dissolved in a distilled water/formic acid mixed solvent (80\u00a0mL/20\u00a0mL). After 1 min of stirring, 1.75\u00a0g of fumaric acid was added and stirred at 600\u00a0rpm for 90\u00a0min to form a homogeneous solution. The resulting solution was left at room temperature for 48\u00a0h to produce a cloudy solution, indicating the formation of MOF-801. Afterward, the white precipitate was collected by centrifugation, followed by washing one time with water and two times with ethanol, placing at room temperature for 48\u00a0h, and finally drying at 150\u00a0\u00b0C under vacuum for 7\u00a0h. The green-synthesized MOF-801 is named GS-MOF-801 during this study."

            "text": "The XRD patterns of both the SS-MOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 are depicted in Fig.\u00a02a. It can be seen that both samples exhibit distinct peaks at angles of 8.5\u00b0 and 9.8\u00b0. These peaks correspond to the crystal faces of MOF-801, specifically the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) planes, respectively. This result is in good agreement with the XRD patterns of previous studies44,45 indicating the high phase purity of the powder samples. The crystallite size of the SSMOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 is ~ 46\u00a0nm and ~ 66\u00a0nm respectively. According to Grosu\u2019s report, small crystallite size can lead to a significant decrease in intrusion and extrusion pressures, which can be an advantage for water harvesting systems46. From the FTIR spectrum of the synthesized SS-MOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 shown in Fig.\u00a02b, a broad peak around 3416 cm\u22121 indicates the presence of the OH group47. The peaks at 1654 cm\u22121,1581 cm\u22121, and 1401 cm\u22121 could be attributed to \u2013C=O\u2013O bonds48. On the other hand, the peaks at 1206 cm\u22121, 986 cm\u22121, and 794 cm\u22121 are identified as the C\u2013H vibrations49. Finally, the absorption at 657 cm\u22121 and 487 cm\u22121 could be assigned to Zr6(OH)4O4 vibrations and Zr-(OC) asymmetric stretching, respectively50. As can be seen, the increase in the OH peak area of GS-MOF-801 can signify the sample contains more hydrophilic functional groups compared to SS-MOF-801. And there may be more opportunities for intermolecular interactions and hydrogen bonding, which could lead to a better water adsorption behavior of GS-MOF-801. Consequently, the utilization of water in the synthesis of MOF-801 not only addresses the drawback of employing harmful solvents like DMF but also leads to the formation of more hydrophilic functional groups, which offers benefits for water adsorption.\nThe graph in Fig.\u00a02c displays the nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and micropore size distribution of the powder samples of MOF-801, which are related to Type-I adsorption isotherm51. It should be highlighted that a slight inflexion of the adsorption isotherm curve in both samples, can be related to the occurrence of some defects52.

The mentioned defects within the crystal lattices provide numerous adsorption sites for water. Additionally, the concentration of defects in the GS-MOF-801 can be adjusted by varying the amount of the modulator (formic acid) used in the aqueous synthesis. It is important to mention that the amount of formic acid employed in the present work was determined as the optimal quantity based on the previous study to achieve the highest possible defect concentration in GS-MOF-80139,42. The specific surface area of SS-MOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 is 365.43 m2/g and 691.05 m2/g respectively. On the other hand, SS-MOF-801 shows two distinct types of micropores, which have radii of 0.7\u00a0nm and 1.4\u00a0nm. In contrast, GS-MOF-801 has a main pore size, located at a radius of 0.7\u00a0nm. GS-MOF-801 is expected to outperform SS-MOF-801 in terms of water adsorption. This expectation is based on the potential for GS-MOF-801 to possess a greater quantity of defects and an 89% larger specific surface area, enabling more active sites for water molecules to interact with and be adsorbed. Figure\u00a02d shows the TGA curve of synthesized GS-MOF-801 crystals. A 23% weight loss occurs below ~ 200\u00a0\u00b0C, owing to the removal of adsorbed water and guest molecules trapped within the adsorbent\u2019s pores. Subsequently, the sharp declining trend starts to begin above 350\u00a0\u00b0C and extends up to 500\u00a0\u00b0C which is attributed to the loss of fumaric acid and breaking of the carboxylate groups. This observation points to the adsorbent\u2019s excellent thermal stability42,51.\nThe morphology and size of the synthesized samples were subsequently analyzed using FESEM and TEM. The FESEM micrographs demonstrate that both SS-MOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 have a uniform dispersion and size distribution (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d). Nevertheless, SS-MOF-801 displays an octahedral structure, whereas GS-MOF-801 tends to crystallize in a rounded form. These findings align with previous research indicating that the water-based synthesis of MOF-801 predominantly yields spherical particles instead of octahedral ones53. On the other hand, based on the FESEM (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d) and TEM (Fig.\u00a03e,f) images, it can be observed that the particle size of both MOF-801 samples is less than 200\u00a0nm, which is in accordance with previously reported values54."

            "text": "It can be seen from Fig.\u00a04 that the adsorption performance of the adsorbents varies depending on the activation temperature. In Fig.\u00a04a, it can be observed that SS-MOF-801-90 achieves a maximum adsorption capacity of 36.7\u00a0g/100\u00a0g at the end of the 24-h adsorption process. This value represents a 71% increase compared to the adsorption capacity of SS-MOF-801-70, which is 21.5\u00a0g/100\u00a0g. This significant difference can be attributed to the fact that a temperature of 70\u00a0\u00b0C is inadequate for the complete removal of adsorbed water from the adsorbent cavities and preparing the adsorption sites sufficiently for the adsorption process42,44. Additionally, as observed in Fig.\u00a04b, similar findings are observed for GS-MOF-801-90 too, and its maximum adsorption capacity exceeds that of GS-MOF-801-70 by 92%. Furthermore, the inset of Fig.\u00a04a and b displays the amount of water removed from the total adsorbed water in corresponding samples at the end of the desorption process. It can be seen that the adsorbed water content in MOF-801-90 and MOF-801-110 has been completely removed during the desorption process, whereas in the case of SS-MOF-801-70 and GS-MOF-801-70, it has been reduced by 71% and 61% respectively. In earlier studies, it has been indicated that MOF-801 demonstrates a lower activation temperature in comparison to other adsorbents55,56, and the current observation confirms that the optimum activation temperature for both SS-MOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 adsorbents is 90\u00a0\u00b0C. It is obvious that the impact of the activation temperature of 110\u00a0\u00b0C on the water adsorption performance of both samples is also favorable. It is worth mentioning that the maximum adsorption capacity of GS-MOF-801-90 is 41.1\u00a0g/100\u00a0g, which represents a 12% increase compared to SS-MOF-801-90. This difference can be attributed to GS-MOF-801\u2019s significantly larger specific surface area, which is 89% greater than that of SS-MOF-801. Additionally, the potential for a higher quantity of defects and the presence of more hydrophilic functional groups in GS-MOF-801 compared to SS-MOF-801 may further contribute to this difference. Therefore, alongside the use of water instead of the harmful DMF as the solvent for the synthesis of GS-MOF-801, it exhibits superior water adsorption performance in comparison to SS-MOF-801."

Subsequently, adsorption tests were conducted under a controlled relative humidity of 50% (\u00b1 5%) at different temperatures: 15\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and 35\u00a0\u00b0C (\u00b1 1\u00a0\u00b0C). The results are depicted in Fig.\u00a05. As observed in Fig.\u00a05a, the maximum adsorption capacity of SS-MOF-801 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C is 31.2\u00a0g/100\u00a0g, but it decreases to 28.4\u00a0g/100\u00a0g when the temperature drops to 15\u00a0\u00b0C. In other words, the maximum adsorption capacity of SS-MOF-801 at 15\u00a0\u00b0C is 9% lower than that at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Overall, at a constant relative humidity of 50%, SS-MOF-801 demonstrates its optimum adsorption performance at a temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C. When the temperature is 35\u00a0\u00b0C, the maximum adsorption capacity of SS-MOF-801 decreases by 4% compared to that at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig.\u00a05, the water adsorption curves of MOF-801 at 35\u00a0\u00b0C exhibit signs of instability after a duration of 6\u00a0h. The findings suggested that elevated temperatures can lead to a slight reduction in the water adsorption capacity of adsorbents under the condition of constant relative humidity. A similar behavior was also previously observed in the MIL-101(Cr) adsorbent57. This can be attributed to the activation of certain water molecules at higher temperatures, causing them to detach from the sorption sites within the adsorbents. Consequently, this results in a decline in the adsorption efficiency of the samples58. According to Fig.\u00a05b, the highest adsorption capacity of GS-MOF-801 is also observed at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, reaching 36.2\u00a0g/100\u00a0g. This value is 16% higher than that of SS-MOF-801.\nThe effect of relative humidity on water sorption It is expected that humidity would significantly impact the water adsorption performance of an adsorbent. In this regard, the water adsorption performance of synthesized adsorbents was investigated at a constant temperature\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16983 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-44367-1\nof 25\u00a0\u00b0C (\u00b1 1\u00a0\u00b0C), under various relative humidity conditions of 30%, 50%, and 80% (\u00b1 5%) (Fig.\u00a06). As seen in Fig.\u00a06, both SS-MOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 exhibit an increase in adsorption performance with increasing humidity. Specifically, the maximum adsorption capacity of SS-MOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 increases by 19% and 15%, respectively, when the humidity rises from 30 to 50%. Furthermore, with an increase in humidity from 50 to 80%, the maximum adsorption capacity of the mentioned adsorbents also increases by 17% and 13% respectively. Naturally, this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that as the relative humidity increases, the pressure of water vapor also increases at a constant temperature leading to better water adsorption in adsorbents57. Furthermore, as observed in Fig.\u00a06, GS-MOF-801 exhibits better performance in water adsorption compared to SS-MOF-801 at all humidity levels. It should be noted that even at a relative humidity of 30%, GS-MOF-801 demonstrates a considerable adsorption capacity of 31.5\u00a0g/100\u00a0g. This indicates that MOF-801 can also be effective in low humidity conditions (e.g., in North Africa)."

As a result, the majority of water adsorption occurs within the mentioned time frame. For example,\nFigure\u00a03.

Similarly, at a temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C and relative humidity of 80% (Fig.\u00a06a), this value increases to ~ 90%. Therefore, in order to examine the adsorption rates of SS-MOF-801 and GS-MOF-801 under different temperature and humidity conditions, the adsorption rate during the first four hours, referred to as \" Adsorption rate I\" was compared with the adsorption rate during the subsequent four hours, referred to as \" Adsorption rate II\". The results can be observed in Tables\u00a01 and 2. Based on the findings presented in Tables\u00a01 and 2, it is apparent that the adsorbents exhibit a noticeably higher rate of water adsorption during the first four hours compared to the subsequent four hours. Hence, in\u00a0situations where there is a time limitation for utilizing the adsorbent for water adsorption, MOF-801 can be considered as a suitable option since it proves to exhibit a substantial level of adsorption within the initial hours of the adsorption process. Furthermore, the highest adsorption rate is observed in GS-MOF-801 at a temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C and relative humidity of 80% RH. Moreover, it can be seen that as the temperature and relative humidity levels rise, the water adsorption rate I also increases. From Table\u00a02, it can be concluded that the cavities of adsorbents become saturated more quickly in high humidity levels compared to low humidity levels. As a result, the adsorption rate II decreases as the humidity level increases."

Figure\u00a07a and b depict the FESEM images of GS-MOF-801 before the first cycle and after the 20th adsorption\u2013desorption cycle, respectively. The FESEM images show that the GS-MOF-801 particles exhibit a sign of slight deformation compared to their initial shape after undergoing consecutive adsorption\u2013desorption cycles. Besides, based on the observations in Fig.\u00a07c, it is evident that even after undergoing multiple cycles, the crystallinity of GSMOF-801 remains unaffected. The graph in Fig.\u00a07d and its inset demonstrate the impact of 20 cycles of water adsorption\u2013desorption on nitrogen physisorption and pore size distribution of GS-MOF-801. As can be seen, after consecutive adsorption cycles, the pore size of GS-MOF-801 remained relatively stable with no significant changes. And the specific surface area of the adsorbent decreased to 600.35 m2/g after 20 cycles, representing a 13% reduction compared to its initial value which could be attributed to factors such as slight structural degradation or exhaustion of the adsorbent.

For this purpose, after each adsorption test under the mentioned temperature and humidity conditions, the adsorbent was heated to 90\u00a0\u00b0C to remove the adsorbed water before the next cycle and then tested again under similar conditions.

As observed, the adsorption performance of GS-MOF-801 remains relatively constant throughout the 6 cycles, with ~ 39.5\u00a0g/100\u00a0g of the adsorption capacity remaining. Therefore, the adsorbent demonstrates high-performance stability during the 6 cycles. It should be noted that the slight increase observed in the fourth and fifth cycles, could be attributed to improved removal of water inside the pores during the pre-cycle desorption process. Furthermore, the absence of a significant decrease in adsorption capacity throughout the cycles indicates that the adsorbent has not suffered from any exhaustion or structural degradation over the 6 cycles."
