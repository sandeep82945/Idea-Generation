            "heading": "1 Introduction",
            "text": "In this paper, we propose the weighted Myerson value for Network games that combines the notion of the weighted Shapley value of cooperative games with transferable utilities (TU games in short) due to [20, 30] and the Myerson value of Network games due to [18, 23]. The Myerson value for Network games is itself a manifestation of the Shapley value of TU games with the assumption that players in the network are symmetric in terms of their capacity to form and sustain links in the network. However, in practice, this assumption is too restrictive, see for example [16, 17]. Thus, we assume that each player\nin the network is endowed with a weight and accordingly the weighted Myerson value will take care of these weights in allocating the worth generated by the network.\nMathematically speaking, a cooperative game with transferable utilities is a pair (N, v) where N denotes the player set and v denotes a characteristic function v : 2N 7\u2192 R such that v(\u2205) = 0. The domain 2N of v is the power set of N containing all the coalitions of N . Thus, v assigns a real number to each coalition which we call its worth. The worth v(N) is the worth of the grand coalition N . It is assumed that the grand coalition N is formed in a TU game. The problem is then to allocate the worth of the grand coalition v(N) among the players. Among the many solutions (allocations) proposed from time to time, the Shapley value [29] is perhaps the most popular value. It is the average of the marginal contributions of the players over all possible orderings of joining a coalition. The underlying assumption here is that all the coalitions must be formed before the grand coalition is formed at the final stage. However, Myerson [23] in his seminal paper, argues that coalitions are feasible among the players if they have some kind of pre-existing connections among themselves. This connections can be represented by the edges or links in a graph. Therefore, Myerson terms this new TU game as a graph restricted game. He obtains an allocation rule for the graph restricted game which is the Shapley value of an associate TU game. This value is later called the Myerson value in [18]. In [18], the graph restricted game is renamed as communication situation. In a communication situation, it only matters whether players are connected through a graph or not, take for example, the worth of a coalition does not depend on whether players in it are connected by direct or indirect links. However, in [18], it is argued that when network formation is costly, take for example, when the physical structure of a network exists, the direct and indirect links have their own significances, and therefore, the worths of the coalitions need to be replaced by the worths of the subnetworks. Thus a Network game is a pair (N, v) where N is the player set but v is a function that assigns a real number to each subnetwork of a given network formed by the players in N . The Myerson value of communication situations has a direct counterpart in Network games as well. Other allocation rules for communication situations and Network games such as the position value [3, 22, 33], the multilateral value [6], the outside option values [1] etc., are also found in the literature, however, in this current study, our focus is on the Myerson value only.\nIn TU games, the weighted Shapley value [30] is proposed as a further generalization of the Shapley value such that while allocating the worth of the grand coalition each player receives her payoff proportional to her pre-assigned weight. The Shapley value, in particular, is one such allocation where the players are considered to be of equal weights. Bringing this idea to communication situations, Haeringer [16, 17] proposes the weighted Myerson value where he assumes that players in a communication situation have, in general, non-identical bargaining power and therefore, the ordinary Myerson value cannot\njustify a fare allocation for those players. In a similar manner, in Network games, it is quite intuitive to assume that players in the network are un-equal in terms of forming a link or sustain it. To make the case more complicated, we may further assume that the players have un-equal capabilities for forming direct and indirect links and sustain them. Thus a weight system measures this un-equal capacities of players. Accordingly, the weighted Myerson value awards the players their share from the value generated by the given network proportional to their weights. To understand how the weights of the players in a network game play a significant role in allocating the worth of a network we present the following two examples.\nExample 1. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China aims to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a vast network of land and sea routes. Its main goal is to boost regional cooperation, trade, and economic growth. The BRI is attractive because it involves significant investments in various infrastructure projects like ports, roads, railways, airports, power, and telecommunication networks. With around 156 countries taking part in the BRI, each with different economic strengths and negotiation abilities, the way they participate varies. In this context, a country\u2019s weight represents its influence in negotiations. Typically, larger and more advanced countries have more negotiating power and can secure better trade deals. Smaller and less developed countries may face stricter trade conditions to protect their own industries. The weighted Myerson value ensures a fair distribution of benefits and drawbacks in trade agreements, considering each country\u2019s economic strength and negotiation ability. This approach aims for fairness and long-lasting trade agreements, especially when there are economic disparities among countries.\nExample 2. Next, take the example of the Paris Agreement, which aims to combat climate change in order to limit global warming. With about 195 countries in this network with different historical and current greenhouse gas emissions, the weights of participating countries represent the level of their greenhouse gas emissions. The countries having higher rates of emissions receive higher weights, reflecting their greater contribution to the climate crisis. When resources and commitments are distributed for climate change, the weighted Myerson value will guarantee that countries with higher emissions (so greater responsibility for this problem) will pay a greater share of their resources. This promotes fairness with respect to the contribution of each country to emissions. When defining global climate policy, countries with less emissions can have a greater say. This encourages countries with greater responsibility for emissions to take proactive measures to reduce their impact on climate change. The weighted Myerson value will ensure fair and coordinated efforts to address climate change within the framework of the Paris Agreement.\nAfter the weighted Myerson value is being introduced for Network games, we characterize it follow-\ning similar characterizations by [1, 16]. We also provide a non-cooperative approach to obtain the value as an SPNE of a suitably designed bidding mechanism in line with [25, 34]\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the definitions and notations that are relevant to the development of the current paper. Section 3 includes two distinct characterizations for the class of weighted Myerson values. In Section 4, we discuss the concept of network potential as introduced by Slikker [32] and present a characterization of the weighted Myerson value using this notion. Section 5 contains two seperate bidding mechanisms designed for the class of weighted Myerson values, highlighting their practical implications and applications. In Section 6, we outline potential areas for future research and exploration within this domain."

            "text": "In this section, we compile the notations, definitions and results to be used in our current paper from [1, 16, 19].\n\u2022 Players\nLet N = {1, 2, ..., n} denote the set of players. A coalition S is a subset of N . We use the corresponding lower case letter s to denote the cardinality of coalition S, thus |S| = s.\n\u2022 Networks\nIn a set of players denoted by N where each player is distinct, a link represented as ij signifies an undirected connection between player i and player j. It is important to note that ij and ji are equivalent and represent the same relationship.\nLet gN = {ij | i, j \u2208 N , and i 6= j} be the set of all possible links with the player set N . This set is known as the complete network. The set of all possible networks on N is given by GN = {g | g \u2286 gN}. The network g0 = \u2205 is the network without any links, which we call the empty network. Let |g| denote the number of links in a network g. It follows that, |gN | = ( n\n2\n)\n= 12n(n \u2212 1), and\n|g0| = 0. The set of players in the network g is denoted by N(g). For every network g \u2208 GN , and every player i \u2208 N we denote the neighborhood of i in g by Ni(g) = {ij \u2208 g : i 6= j}. Thus, Ni(g) is the set of players with whom i is directly linked in g. Also, denote by ni(g) = |Ni(g)|, and n(g) = |N(g)|. Denote by gi = {ij \u2208 g | j \u2208 Ni(g)} \u2286 g the set of links of player i in g.\n\u2022 Networks on subsets of players\nFor any g \u2208 GN , and S \u2286 N , the restriction of g on the coalition S is denoted by g|S , and is given by g|S = {ij \u2208 g | i, j \u2208 S}.\n\u2022 Paths\nA path in g connecting i and j is a set of distinct players {i1, i2, . . . , ip} \u2286 N(g) with p > 2 such that i1 = i, ip = j, and {i1i2, i2i3, . . . , ip\u22121ip} \u2286 g. We say i and j are connected to each other if a path exists between them and they are disconnected otherwise.\n\u2022 Components\nThe network h \u2286 g is a component of g if for all i, j \u2208 N(h), i 6= j, there exists a path in h connecting i and j and for any i \u2208 N(h) and j \u2208 N(g), ij \u2208 g implies ij \u2208 h. In other words, a component of g is simply a maximally connected sub-network of g. We denote the set of components of the network g by C(g).\n\u2022 Isolated players\nThe players in N which are not connected to any players in g are called isolated players. Let N0(g) denote the set of all such isolated players. Then, we have N0(g) = N \\N(g) = {i \u2208 N | Ni(g) = \u2205}. Clearly, N0(g0) = N .\n\u2022 Value functions\nA value function on GN is a function v : GN \u2192 R such that v(g0) = 0. The set of all possible\nvalue functions with the player set N denoted by VN is a 2\nn(n\u2212 1)\n2 \u22121 dimensional vector space.\nLet v0 denote the null value function given by v0(g) = 0 for all g \u2208 GN .\n\u2022 A Basis for value functions\nAn important subclass of the class of value functions inVN is the class of unanimity value functions which is defined as follows.\n\u2013 For any network g \u2208 GN and g\u0304 \u2286 g, the unanimity value function ug\u0304 is defined \u2200g\u2032 \u2286 g as:\nug(g\u2032) =\n  \n \n1 if g \u2286 g\u2032\n0 otherwise.\nThis class of value functions forms a basis for VN . So, each v \u2208 VN such that v 6= v0, can be represented as\nv = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2208GN\n\u03bbg\u2032 (v)ug\u2032 (1)\nwhere \u03bbg\u2032 (v) are unique unanimity coefficients corresponding to the unanimity value functions ug\u2032 called Harsanyi dividends1 and are given by,\n\u03bbg\u2032 = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g\n(\u22121)|g|\u2212|g \u2032|v(g\u2032).\n\u2022 Component additive value functions\nAn interesting subclass of value functions is that of Component additive value functions where the values do not spill over from one component to the other. Thus, a value function v \u2208 VN is component additive if\nv(g) = \u2211\nh\u2208C(g)\nv(h) for any g \u2208 GN .\nThe space of the component additive value functions with player set N is denoted by HN , which is a \u2211\nh\u2208C(g)(2 |h| \u2212 1) dimensional subspace of VN . It is shown in [33] that the component additive unanimity value functions forms a basis of the space of component additive value functions. So, each v \u2208 HN such that v 6= v0, can be represented as\nv = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2208GN\n\u03b2g\u2032(v)ug\u2032\nwhere \u03b2g\u2032(v) are unique unanimity coefficients corresponding to the component additive unanimity value functions ug\u2032 2. An important result concerning component additive value functions is given in [33].\nLemma 1 (([33], page 267, Lemma 1)). For a component additive value function v, \u03b2g\u2032(v) = 0 for any network g \u2208 GN that has at least two links that belong to two different components.\n\u2022 Network game\nA Network game is a pair (N, v) where N is the player set and v is a value function.\n\u2022 Allocation rules\nA network allocation rule is a function Y : GN \u00d7VN \u2192 RN such that for every g \u2208 GN and every v \u2208 VN , Yi(g, v) = 0 whenever i \u2208 N0(g).\n\u2022 Component Balanced allocation rules\nAn allocation rule Y is Component Balanced if for every v \u2208 HN and g \u2208 GN it holds that\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(h)\nYi(g, v) = v(h), for every component h \u2208 C(g).\n1See Page 523 of [11]. 2for more details, see [33].\nComponent Balance ensures that there are no externalities across components due to a component additive value functions. So, the value of each component is allocated among the members of the component.\n\u2022 Equal Bargaining Power\nAn allocation rule Y satisfies Equal Bargaining Power if for every network g \u2208 GN , v \u2208 HN , and for all i, j \u2208 N(g), we have\nYi(g, v)\u2212 Yi(g \u2212 ij, v) = Yj(g, v)\u2212 Yj(g \u2212 ij, v).\nNote that achieving Equal Bargaining Power doesn\u2019t strictly imply that players need to evenly distribute the marginal value of a link. Instead, it signifies that two players should both reap equal benefits or bear equal consequences when the link joining these two players is removed from the network.\n\u2022 Additivity\nFor each pair of value functions v, v\u2032 \u2208 VN and g \u2208 GN , if\nYi(g, v + v \u2032) = Yi(g, v) + Yi(g, v \u2032) \u2200i \u2208 N,\nthen Y is said to satisfy Additivity. It states that the allocation rule exhibits no externalities when players within a network engage in multiple games, each described by their respective value functions.\n\u2022 Superfluous Link\nA link l \u2286 g is Superfluous in g with respect to the value function v \u2208 VN , namely,\nv(g\u2032) = v(g\u2032 \\ l)\nfor all g\u2032 \u2286 g such that l \u2286 g\u2032. A Superfluous Link exerts no influence on any network.\n\u2022 Superfluous Link Property\nAn allocation rule Y on GN \u00d7 VN satisfies the Superfluous Link Property if\nY (g, v) = Y (g \\ l, v)\nfor all g \u2208 GN and v \u2208 VN and all links l that are Superfluous in g with respect to v. This axiom asserts that the existence or nonexistence of a link has no impact on the value of any network, nor does it influence the allocations of players within the network.\n\u2022 Point Anonymity\nThe value function v is Point Anonymous if v(g|S ) = v(g|S\u2032 ) for all S, S \u2032 \u2286 N(g) such that |S| = |S\u2032|. Under a Point Anonymous value function all active players are equally significant and only the size of the sub-coalitions matter to generate the value of the network and its sub-networks.\n\u2022 Point Anonymity Property\nAn allocation rule satisfies Point Anonymity Property if for all Point Anonymous value functions v and g \u2208 GN , there exists \u03b1 \u2208 R such that\nYi(g, v) =\n  \n \n\u03b1 if i \u2208 N(g)\n0 otherwise.\nFor a Point Anonymous value function, the players are not distinguishable and Point Anonymity\nensures same share for each of the players in the network.\n\u2022 The Myerson value\nThe Myerson value given in [18] is the network allocation rule Y MV : GN \u00d7 VN \u2192 RN given by\nY MVi (g, v) = \u2211\nS\u2286N\\i\n(v(g|S\u222ai)\u2212 v(g|S))\n(\ns!(n(g)\u2212 s\u2212 1)!\nn(g)!\n)\n. (2)\nfor every g \u2208 GN and v \u2208 VN .\nAnother form of the Myerson value using Harsanyi dividends is as follows, see [35]:\nY MVi (g, v) = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\n\u03bbg\u2032(v)\nn(g\u2032) . (3)\nwhere \u03bbg\u2032 (v) = \u2211 g\u2032\u2286g(\u22121) |g|\u2212|g\u2032|v(g\u2032) and n(g\u2032) is the number of players involved in network g\u2032.\nThe Myerson value is the network allocation rule that aggregates the marginal contributions of a players prescribed by the value function. Among many characterizations of the Myerson value, the following characterizations due to [1, 19] are important for us for the development of the weighted Myerson value.\nTheorem 1 ([19], page 134, Theorem 1). The Myerson value is the unique allocation rule on GN \u00d7HN that is Component Balanced and satisfies Equal Bargaining Power.\nTheorem 2 ([1], page 80, Theorem 2). The Myerson value for Network games on the domain GN \u00d7HN is an unique allocation rule that is Component Balanced and satisfies Additivity, the Superfluous Link Property and Point Anonymity Property."

            "text": "In this section, we introduce the weighted Myerson value for Network games. First, we assign a positive real number to each player in the network, which forms an- |N | vector of weights. As already mentioned in the introduction, these weights reflect the player\u2019s significance in forming and sustaining a link in the network. This can be for example, a measure that determines how much a player is central to the network. Thus, in particular, different centrality measures in networks can be weights in a Network game. For details on various centrality measures in networks, we recommend [2, 12, 13]. Formally speaking, the weight function is an injective function from the player set to the set of positive real numbers, i.e., w : N \u2192 R+ such that wi is the weight associated with player i. Denote by WN the class of all possible weight distributions (vectors) over the set of players N. With an abuse of notations, we take the weight function w as a weight vector (wi) |N | i=1 of W N .\nGiven a weight vector, the weighted Myerson value is an allocation rule that generalizes the Myerson value by allowing the players to split their marginal share in each coalition in proportion to their respective weights. Formally, the weighted Myerson value is denoted by Y w\u2212MVi : G N \u00d7 VN \u2192 RN and defined for every g \u2208 GN , v \u2208 VN and w \u2208 WN by\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = \u2211\ng \u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032 (v) (4)\nwhere \u03bbg\u2032 (v) are the unanimity coefficients defined in Section 2.\nIt is to be noted that the Myerson value shares the values given by the unanimity coefficients equally among the members of the subnetworks of the given network. On the other hand, the weighted Myerson value shares the values obtained from the unanimity coefficients proportional to the weights of the players. If we consider wi = constant for all i \u2208 N, then the weighted Myerson value coincides with the Myerson value. In the next section, we provide two axiomatic characterizations of the weighted Myerson value."

            "heading": "3.1 Characterization",
            "text": "Now, we characterize the weighted Myerson value using axioms some of which are standard in cooperative game theory and are trivial extensions to their network counterparts, and some are specific to Network games.\nWe begin with the following lemma.\nLemma 2. The weighted Myerson value satisfies Component Balance, i.e., for all g \u2208 GN , w \u2208 WN ,\nv \u2208 HN , and each h \u2208 C(g), we have\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(h)\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = v(h).\nProof. Let v \u2208 HN, g \u2208 GN, h \u2208 C(g) and w \u2208 WN . Then, we have\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(h)\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = \u2211\ni\u2208N(h)\n\u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032 (v).\nFrom Lemma 1, we have \u03bbg\u2032 (v) = 0 for any g \u2032 \u2286 g that has links that belong to different components. So, we have,\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(h)\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286h:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\n\u2211\ni\u2208N wi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032 (v)\n= \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286h\n\u03bbg\u2032(v)\n= v(h).\nThis completes the proof.\nThe next axiom is the Weighted Bargaining Power. This axiom suggests that the loss or gain by two players after removing their link in the network should be proportional to their respective weights. The axiom goes as follows.\n\u2022 Weighted Bargaining Power: An allocation rule Y satisfies Weighted Bargaining Power if for every\nnetwork g \u2208 GN , v \u2208 HN , w \u2208 WN and for all i, j \u2208 N(g), we have\nwj [ Yi(g, v)\u2212 Yi(g \u2212 ij, v) ] = wi [ Yj(g, v)\u2212 Yj(g \u2212 ij, v) ] .\nLemma 3.

The weighted Myerson value is the unique Component Balanced allocation rule on GN \u00d7 VN that satisfies Weighted Bargaining Power.\nProof. It has already been shown in Lemma 2 and 3 that the weighted Myerson value satisfies Component Balance and Weighted Bargaining Power. We show that the weighted Myerson value is the unique allocation rule that satisfies Component Balance and Weighted Bargaining Power. If possible, let Y and Y w\u2212MV both satisfy these two axioms. Let, g be a network with a minimal number of links such that Y 6= Y w\u2212MV . Then, for h \u2208 C(g) and any pair i, j \u2208 N(h), we get\nY (g \u2212 ij, v) = Y w\u2212MV (g \u2212 ij, v).\nThen using Weighted Bargaining Power, we get\nYi(g, v)\u2212 wi\nwj Yj(g, v) = Yi(g \u2212 ij, v)\u2212\nwi wj Yj(g \u2212 ij, v)\n= Y w\u2212MVi (g \u2212 ij, v)\u2212 wi\nwj Y w\u2212MVj (g \u2212 ij, v)\n= Y w\u2212MVi (g, v)\u2212 wi\nwj Y w\u2212MVj (g, v). (5)\nUsing Component Balance, we have \u2211\ni\u2208N(h)\n[\nYi(g, v)\u2212 Y w\u2212MV i (g, v)\n]\n= 0.\nThus Eq.(5) implies \u2211\ni\u2208N(h)\nwi wj [ Yj(g, v)\u2212 Y w\u2212MV j (g, v) ] = 0.\nThis further implies that \u2211\ni\u2208N(h)\nwi wj n(h) [ Yj(g, v)\u2212 Y w\u2212MV j (g, v) ] = 0.\nAs wi\nwj > 0 and n(h) > 0, so we have Yj(g, v)\u2212 Y\nw\u2212MV j (g, v) = 0.\nIt follows that Yj(g, v) = Y w\u2212MV j (g, v). Thus, there exist an unique allocation rule satisfying Component Balance and Weighted Bargaining Power.\nThis characterization is an adaptation of the properties defined in [16] whose interpretations are natural and can be extended directly to Network games. Our next axiom is Efficiency.\n\u2022 Efficiency: An allocation rule Y is Efficient if for each g \u2208 GN and v \u2208 VN it holds that\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nYi(g, v) = v(g).\nAn Efficient network allocation rule distributes the total value generated by the network among the participating players.\nLemma 4. The weighted Myerson value satisfies Efficiency, namely, for all g \u2208 GN , w \u2208 WN , and v \u2208 VN , we have \u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = v(g).\nProof. Let v \u2208 VN, g \u2208 GN, and w \u2208 WN . Then, we have\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = \u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\n\u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032 (v)\n= \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\n\u2211\ni\u2208N wi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032(v)\n= \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g\n\u03bbg\u2032(v)\n= v(g).\nThis completes the proof.\nNext we show that the weighted Myerson value satisfies Additivity.\nLemma 5. The weighted Myerson value satisfies Additivity.\nAdditivity follows directly from the fact that the unanimity coefficients \u03bbg\u2032 (\u00b7) in Eq.(4) also satisfy Additivity, namely, \u03bbg\u2032 (\u03b1v + \u03b2u) = \u03b1\u03bbg\u2032 (v) + \u03b2\u03bbg\u2032 (u) for u, v \u2208 VN and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R. The next Lemma shows that the weighted Myerson value satisfies Superfluous Link Property due to [1].\nLemma 6. The weighted Myerson value satisfies Superfluous Link Property.\nProof. For any g \u2208 GN , v \u2208 VN and w \u2208 WN , let l be a Superfluous Link in g with respect to v. Then, we have, v(g\u2032) = v(g\u2032 \\ l) \u2200g\u2032 \u2286 g. Since \u2200S \u2286 N , g|S \u2286 g, we have\nv(g|S ) = v(g|S \\ l) = v((g \\ l)|S ) \u2200S \u2286 N.\nHence,\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032 (v)\n= \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g\\l:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032 (v)\n= Y w\u2212MVi (g \\ l, v).\nIn the following axiom, denoted as Network-Specific Player Anonymity, we deviate from the conventional Point Anonymity Property of the Myerson value in Theorem 2. It is important to highlight that the value function is formulated such that players possibly generate a non-zero value only when the whole network is formed.\nDefinition 1. A value function v \u2208 VN is called Network Specific Player Anonymous in g if v(g|S) = 0 for all S \u2282 N .\nThus, in a Network Specific Player Anonymous game, the interplay among the players in smaller/sub networks is absent and therefore, their contributions are significant only when all the players in the given network contribute together. An ideal allocation rule for such a game should distinguish the allocation to two distinct players only by means of the weights they are endowed with. Hence, we have the following axiom.\n\u2022 Network Specific Player Anonymity:\nAn allocation rule Y on GN\u00d7VN satisfies Network Specific Player Anonymity if for every g \u2208 GN , v \u2208 VN that is Network Specific Player Anonymous on g, and w \u2208 WN , there exists an \u03b1 \u2208 R such that\nYi(g, v) = \u03b1wi for all i \u2208 N .\nThis axiom guarantees that players under the given situation receive payoffs proportional to their respective weights within the network.\nLemma 7. The weighted Myerson value satisfies Network Specific Player Anonymity.\nProof. For any g \u2208 GN and w \u2208 WN , let v \u2208 VN be Network Specific Player Anonymous in g. Then, \u03bbg\u2032 (v) = 0 for all g \u2032 ( g. It follows that there exists an \u03b2 \u2208 R such that \u03bbg(v) = v(g) = \u03b2. Hence, we obtain,\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032 (v)\n= \u2211\ng\u2032(g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u03bbg\u2032 (v) +\nwi \u2211 j\u2208N(g) wj \u03bbg(v)\n= wi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g)\nwj \u00b7 \u03b2, for each i \u2208 N(g)\nNow, by taking \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2211\nj\u2208N(g)\nwj , we get the required expression.\nThe following proposition will be useful for our next characterization of the weighted Myerson value.\nProposition 1. If an allocation rule Y on GN \u00d7 V N is Network Specific Player Anonymous and Efficient, we have,\nYi(g, v) =\n   \n \nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g) wj v(g) if i \u2208 N(g)\n0 otherwise.\nProof. Let, v \u2208 VN be Network Specific Player Anonymous and g \u2208 GN be given. For all i \u2208 N \\N(g), we have Yi(g, v) = 0. For all i \u2208 N(g), we have, Yi(g, v) = \u03b1wi. Using Efficiency,\nv(g) = \u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = \u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\n\u03b1wi\nSo, we have, v(g)\n\u2211 j\u2208N(g) wj = \u03b1\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g) wj\nand hence, we get,\n\u03b1 = v(g) \u2211\nj\u2208N(g) wj .\nTherefore,\nY w\u2212MVi (g, v) = wi \u2211\nj\u2208N(g) wj v(g).\nOur second characterization follows.\nTheorem 4. The weighted Myerson value is the unique Efficient allocation rule on GN \u00d7VN that satisfies the Network Specific Player Anonymity, Superfluous Player Property and Additivity.\nProof. From Lemma 4, 5, 6 and 7, it is evident that the weighted Myerson value satisfy Efficiency,Additivity, Superfluous Link Property and Network Specific Player Anonymity. We now show the converse part. Our proof follows a similar procedure as that in Theorem 2 of [1]. However, to ensure the thoroughness of the deductions, we describe it here in details again. Let Y w\u2212MV satisfy Efficiency, Additivity, Superfluous Link Property and Network Specific Player Anonymity. Let, g \u2208 GN , v \u2208 VN , w \u2208 WN . Recall from Eq.(1), v = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2208GN g\u2032 6=g0\n\u03bbg\u2032 (v)ug\u2032 where\n\u03bbg\u2032(v) are unique unanimity coefficients corresponding to unanimity value function ug\u2032 .

            "text": "The concept of the potential function for TU games is first proposed by Hart and Mas-Colell [24]. Potential functions are mathematical tools used to analyze and characterize the behavior of TU games, particularly in terms of the allocation of the payoffs to the players. This concept finds further extensions in the works of Winter [37], Owen [27], Xu et al. [38] etc., just to name a few. Slikker [32] uses the notion of network potential to characterize the Myerson value. The network potential focuses on the player\u2019s overall marginal contributions through their links in the network.\n3Y PV (g, v) is the position value for Network games discussed in [33].\nThus, in the context of networks, the use of potential functions pertaining to TU games provides a powerful framework for understanding and analyzing various aspects of the interactions.\nDefinition 2. Let, Let g \u2208 GN and v \u2208 VN . Given a function P : GN \u00d7 VN \u2192 R such that P (go, v) = 0, the total marginal contribution of a player i through all her links prescribed by P is\nDiP (g, v) = P (g, v)\u2212 P (g \\ gi, v) \u2200(g, v) \u2208 G N \u00d7 VN , i \u2208 N(g).\nDefinition 3.

Given a weight vector w \u2208 WN , a function Pw : GN \u00d7 VN 7\u2192 R is said to be a weighted player potential function if Pw(go, v) = 0, \u2200v \u2208 VN and\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwiD iPw(g, v) = v(g) \u2200(g, v) \u2208 GN \u00d7 VN .\nThe weighted player potential function is designed to assess the weighted contribution of a player in the network. It evaluates a player\u2019s influence in a network by considering their assigned weights. We have the following theorem that characterizes the weighted Myerson value using player potential function.\nTheorem 5. For every positive weight vector w \u2208 WN , there exists a unique weighted potential function Pw in GN \u00d7 VN such that wiDiPw(g, v) = Y w\u2212MV i (g, v).\nProof. Initially, we show the existence of a player potential function. Subsequently, we describe how the marginal contributions given by this player potential function is aligned with the weighted Myerson value. Let, g \u2208 GN , v \u2208 VN andw \u2208 WN be given. Now, from Eq.(1), we can write v = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2208GN g\u2032 6=g0\n\u03bbg\u2032(v)ug\u2032 .\nWe define Pw : GN \u00d7 VN 7\u2192 R as\nPw(g, v) = \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g\n\u03bbg\u2032 (v) \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u2200g \u2208 GN , v \u2208 VN .

Also, \u2200g \u2208 GN ,\nDiPw(g, v) = Pw(g, v)\u2212 Pw(g \\ gi, v)\n= \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g\n\u03bbg\u2032 (v) \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj \u2212\n\u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g\\gi\n\u03bbg\u2032 (v) \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj\n= \u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\n\u03bbg\u2032(v) \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj\n=\u21d2 wiD iPw(g, v) = wi\n\u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\n\u03bbg\u2032(v) \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj\n=\u21d2 wiD iPw(g, v) =\n\u2211\ng\u2032\u2286g:i\u2208N(g\u2032)\nwi \u03bbg\u2032(v) \u2211\nj\u2208N(g\u2032 )\nwj\n=\u21d2 wiD iPw(g, v) = Y w\u2212MVi (g, v).\nSince Y w\u2212MV satisfies Efficiency, it follows that \u2211 i\u2208N(g) wiD iPw(g, v) = v(g). Thus, we have for all g \u2208 GN and v \u2208 VN , Pw given by Eq.(6) is a weighted player potential function. It remains to show that the weighted player potential function is unique. IfQw(g, v) is any weighted player potential function then we have that for all (g, v) with g 6= go,\nv(g) = \u2211\ni\u2208N\nwi\n[ Qw(g, v)\u2212Qw(g \\ gi, v) ]\n= \u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwi\n[ Qw(g, v)\u2212Qw(g \\ gi, v) ]\n(7)\nThe second equality holds since Qw(g, v) = Qw(g \\ gi, v) for gi = g0 which is further equivalent to i \u2208 No(g). Using Eq.(6). we have,\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwi\n[ Qw(g, v)\u2212Qw(g \\ gi, v) ] = v(g)\n=\u21d2 \u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwiQ w(g, v)\u2212\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwiQ w(g \\ gi, v) = v(g)\n=\u21d2 \u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwiQ w(g, v) = v(g) +\n\u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwiQ w(g \\ gi, v)\n=\u21d2 Qw(g, v) = 1 \u2211\ni\u2208N(g) wi\n[\nv(g) + \u2211\ni\u2208N(g)\nwiQ w(g \\ gi, v)\n]\n. (8)\nFor any v \u2208 VN , we know that Qw(go, v) = 0. As a result, Qw(g, v) recursively using Eq.(7) proves the uniqueness of the weighted player potential function. This completes the proof.\nIn the following section, we present the implementation of the weighted Myerson value."

Now, let\u2019s consider the scenario where |g| = k \u2265 1, and assume that the mechanism has been previously specified for networks and components containing a maximum of k \u2212 1 links. The mechanism operates through a series of rounds, and each round consists of three distinct stages (labeled as t = 1\u2212 3). After the completion of a round, the game either concludes or initiates new rounds for any remaining players. Now, we will thoroughly explain one round of the mechanism, specifically looking at a random network g with k links.\nStage 1. In this round, each player i \u2208 N(g) makes a bid bij \u2208 R to all j \u2208 N(g) \\ i.\nLet\nBi = \u2211\nj 6=i\nwib i j \u2212\n\u2211\nj 6=i\nwjb j i\nrepresent the net bid of player i, which quantifies their \u2019relative\u2019 willingness to take on the role of\nthe proposer. Let i\u2217 denote the player with the highest net bid in this round. In the event of multiple players\nhaving the same maximum value, any of these top bidders is selected as the \u2019winner\u2019 with equal probability. Moving on to the subsequent stage, the player i\u2217 selected as the \u201dwinner\u201d in this manner becomes the proposer. Proceed to Stage 2.\nStage 2. The player i\u2217, who has been identified as the \u201dwinner\u201d in the previous stage, now puts forward\nproposed payoffs denoted as yj to the other players j \u2208 N(g) \\ i\u2217. Proceed to stage 3.\nStage 3. In this stage, players apart from i\u2217 individually consider and sequentially decide whether to accept\nor reject the proposed offers. Consequently, two distinct cases emerge.\nCase (a). If the proposed offer is declined by at least one of the players, the players belonging to the\nset N(g) move on to engage in the subsequent round. In this next round, the set of links within component g becomes |g \\ gi\u2217 |. It is noteworthy that this ensuing round continues till the count of links in |g \\ gi\u2217 | \u2265 1. Stop.\nCase (b). If the proposed offer is accepted, then each player j \u2208 N(g)\\ i\u2217 receives a payoff of yj , while\nplayer i\u2217 obtains\nv(g)\u2212 \u2211\nj\u2208N(g)\\i\u2217\nyj .\nIt is worth noting that these payoffs are received in addition to the bids made during stage 3, and possibly including payoffs from prior rounds. Consequently, the ultimate payoff for player j \u2208 N(g) \\ i\u2217 can be expressed as\nyj + b i\u2217,l j .\nSimilarly, the final payoff for player i\u2217 is given by\nv(g)\u2212 \u2211\nj\u2208N(g)\\i\u2217\n(yj + b i\u2217,l j ).

Note that, the removal of players at the end of a round, also leads to the complete deletion of all links associated with the players which may result in the emergence of several components and, subsequently, separate parallel mechanisms. Next we present the Theorems without their proofs.\nTheorem 7. For any g \u2208 GN and a zero-monotonic Network game v \u2208 HN , there exists a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium within the bidding mechanism where the players\u2019 payoffs align with their weighted Myerson value.\nIn a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium, the theorem shows that a player\u2019s payoff always matches her weighted Myerson value. This remains true even when the proposer is selected randomly. So, in this equilibrium, the outcome is guaranteed to be the player\u2019s weighted Myerson value.\nTheorem 8. For all g \u2208 GN , a zero monotonic Network game v \u2208 HN and each sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium in \u0393w\u2212MV (g, v), the payoffs to the players coincides with the weighted Myerson value.\nIn the following section, we present another implementation of the weighted Myerson value."

It is important to note that the fundamental concept of removing players at the end of a round aligns with the idea of deleting all the links associated with a player in this mechanism as well. However, it is essential to highlight that while their findings have some relevance, applying their results directly is not straightforward. This is primarily because removing a player\u2019s links could potentially divide the network into several components as the process continues.

            "text": "When the number of players in the network g is 1,i.e., n(g) = 1, the solitary player i within this network receives her standalone value 0.\nNow, let us consider the scenario where n(g) = m, and the mechanism is defined for networks or components consisting of at most m \u2212 1 players. The mechanism works in a series of rounds, and each round has three steps (denoted as t = 1\u2212 3). After a round is done, the game can either end or start new rounds for any remaining players. Now that we have set the context, we explain how one round works, designed for a network with m players. It is also important to mention that there is a constant parameter, denoted as 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1, which is predetermined for the mechanism. The mechanism progresses in multiple rounds, and each round has different phases. In each round, a group of active participants, represented as S \u2286 N , is selected. From this group, one individual, denoted as i \u2208 S, becomes the proposer. The various steps of the bargaining process within these rounds is as follows:\nStage 1. In the initial round, the active set encompasses all players, i.e., S = N . The proposer is selected in\na random manner from within the set S, with every player in S having an equal likelihood of being chosen. Suppose, i \u2208 S is chosen as the proposer. Proceed to Stage 2.\nStage 2. The proposer subsequently presents an offer,\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\na g|S ,i\nj \u2264 v(g|S ).\nProceed to Stage 3.\nStage 3. During this phase, participants within the set S, excluding the proposer i, individually assess and\nsequentially determine their acceptance or rejection of the proposed offers. As a result, two separate scenarios can occur.\nCase (a). If every member belonging to the set S agrees to the proposed offer, ascertained through\na predetermined sequence of inquiries, the game concludes, and the associated payoffs are determined accordingly. Stop.\nCase (b). Should the offer face rejection from a single member within the set S, a situation unfolds\nwhere, with a likelihood of \u03c1, progression proceeds to the subsequent round, encompassing the same active player set S. Conversely, with a probability of 1 \u2212 \u03c1, a breakdown scenario ensues: the proposer i exits the game, obtaining a payoff of zero, and the group of active players transforms into S \\ i. Stop.\nThis process constitutes a sequential game with perfect information, wherein each step follows a predetermined order, and all players possess complete knowledge of previous actions. Within this context, a stationary sub-game perfect equilibrium (referred to as SP equilibrium) is established. Notably, the weighted average of proposals within this equilibrium aligns with the weighted Myerson value. Additionally, as the probability denoted by \u03c1 approaches unity, the proposals within these equilibria tend towards the weighted Myerson value, further reinforcing their convergence.\nIn this mechanism, it is important to highlight that the decisions made in a specific phase during a particular round can take into account the payoffs from previous rounds and stages, and this will not affect the overall analysis. To keep things clear in our notation, we will not always explicitly mention the exact specification that we are considering. Instead, we will concentrate on comparing payoffs within a specific setup. Additionally, it is important to consider that in the event of a breakdown, with a probability of 1\u2212\u03c1, when the player exits the network, it can potentially fragment into multiple distinct components. Consequently, multiple parallel mechanisms may also initiate as a result of this fragmentation.\nProposition 2. Let, g \u2208 GN and v \u2208 HN be zero monotonic. Then for each specification of \u03c1(0 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1), there is a SP equilibrium. The proposals corresponding to a SP equilibrium are always accepted and they are characterized by the following:\na.1 a g|S ,i i (\u03c1) = v(g|S )\u2212 \u2211\nj 6=i\na g|S ,i\nj (\u03c1) for each i \u2208 S \u2286 N .\na.2 a g|S ,i j (\u03c1) = \u03c1a g|S j (\u03c1) + (1\u2212 \u03c1)a g|S\\i j (\u03c1) for each i, j \u2208 S with i 6= j and S \u2286 N where\nag|S (\u03c1) = 1 \u2211\ni\u2208S\nwi\n\u2211\ni\u2208S\nwia g|S ,i(\u03c1).\nMoreover, these proposals are unique and non-negative.\nWe use the recursive formula given in the next proposition and omit the formal proof of this proposi-\ntion as it easily follows along the lines of the proof of Proposition 2 in [25].\nProposition 3. Let, (ag|S (\u03c1))S\u2286N be the payoff configuration associated with proposals satisfying (a.1) and (a.2), then it holds that\na g|S i (\u03c1) = 1 \u2211\nj\u2208S wj\n wi[v(g|S )\u2212 v(g|S\\i)] + \u2211\nj 6=i\nwja g|S\\j i (\u03c1)\n\n , i \u2208 S \u2286 N. (11)\nMoreover, these vectors (ag|S (\u03c1))S\u2286N are unique and non-negative.\nProof. Let, g \u2208 GN and v \u2208 HN be zero monotonic. By (a.1), for any i \u2208 S \u2286 N , we have,\n\u2211\nj\u2208S\nwja g|S i (\u03c1) = wi\n(\nv(g|S )\u2212 \u2211\nj 6=i\na g|S ,i j (\u03c1) ) + \u2211\nj 6=i\nwja g|S ,j i (\u03c1)\nApplying (a.2),\n\u2211\nj\u2208S\nwja g|S i (\u03c1) = wi\n(\nv(g|S )\u2212 \u2211\nj 6=i\n{\n\u03c1a g|S j (\u03c1) + (1\u2212 \u03c1)a g|S\\i j (\u03c1)\n})\n+ \u2211\nj 6=i\nwj\n{\n\u03c1a g|S i (\u03c1) + (1\u2212 \u03c1)a g|S\\j i (\u03c1)\n}\n= wiv(g|S )\u2212 \u2211\nj 6=i\n{\nwi\u03c1a g|S j (\u03c1) + (1\u2212 \u03c1)wia g|S\\i j (\u03c1)\n}\n+ \u2211\nj 6=i\n{\n\u03c1wja g|S i (\u03c1) + (1\u2212 \u03c1)wja g|S\\j i (\u03c1)\n}\n= wiv(g|S )\u2212 \u03c1 \u2211\nj 6=i\nwia g|S j (\u03c1)\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c1)\n\u2211\nj 6=i\nwia g|S\\i j (\u03c1)\n+ \u03c1 \u2211\nj 6=i\nwja g|S i (\u03c1) + (1\u2212 \u03c1)\n\u2211\nj 6=i\nwja g|S\\j i (\u03c1)\n= wiv(g|S )\u2212 wiv(g|S\\i) + \u2211\nj 6=i\nwja g|S\\j i (\u03c1)\nThus, we have\na g|S i (\u03c1) = 1 \u2211\nj\u2208S wj\n[\nwi\n( v(g|S )\u2212 v(g|S\\i) ) + \u2211\nj 6=i\nwja g|S\\j i (\u03c1)\n]\n.\nThe payoff of the single coalitions {i} is a g|{i} i (\u03c1) = v({i}) = 0 (i.e., i \u2208 N0(g)) = Y w\u2212MV i ({i}, v) for all i \u2208 N. Therefore, the non-negativity and the uniqueness of a g|S i (\u03c1) follows from the monotonicity of v and Eq.(11) applied recursively. Hence, from Eq.(10), we conclude that a g|S i (\u03c1) = Y w\u2212MV i (g|S , v) \u2200S \u2286 N.\nTheorem 10. Let, g \u2208 GN and v \u2208 HN be zero monotonic. Then for each 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1, there is a unique SP equilibrium. Moreover, for all i \u2208 S \u2286 N , the SP equilibrium payoff vector (ag|S ,i(\u03c1))S\u2286N coincides with the weighted Myerson value for (g|S , v). Also, as \u03c1 \u2192 1, the SP equilibrium proposals (a g|S i (\u03c1))S\u2286N,i\u2208S converges to the weighted Myerson value for (g|S , v).\nProof. The first part of the theorem follows directly from Propositions 2 and 3. Now, for \u03c1 \u2192 1, from (a.1) and (a.2), we have,\na g|S ,i i (\u03c1) = v(g|S )\u2212 \u2211\nj 6=i\na g|S ,i\nj (\u03c1)\n= v(g|S )\u2212 \u2211\nj 6=i\n[\u03c1a g|S j (\u03c1) + (1\u2212 \u03c1)a g|S\\i j (\u03c1)]\n= (1 \u2212 \u03c1)v(g|S )\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c1)v(g|S\\i) + \u03c1a g|S i (\u03c1) = (1 \u2212 \u03c1)[v(g|S )\u2212 v(g|S\\i)] + \u03c1a g|S i (\u03c1)\nand\na g|S ,j i (\u03c1) = \u03c1a g|S i (\u03c1) + (1\u2212 \u03c1)a g|S\\j i (\u03c1).\nwhich implies that a g|S ,i i (\u03c1) \u2192 a g|S i (\u03c1) and a g|S ,j i (\u03c1) \u2192 a g|S i (\u03c1)."

            "text": "In this paper, we begin by presenting characterizations of the weighted Myerson value within Network games. This formulation closely aligns with the weighted Myerson value previously defined by Haeringer [16] for communication structures. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of w-potential in a network\nstructure. Another novelty is the bidding mechanism of weighted Myerson values, employing a procedure similar to the one outlined earlier by Slikker [35] and Hart and Mas-Colell [25] in networks and cooperative TU-games respectively. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the weighted Myerson value finds support within each sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of the individualistic game outlined in section 5.\nBy introducing the bidding mechanism, we gain valuable insights into the interactions that takes place among players. This approach provides a framework for comprehending the determinants that underlie the existence of this specific set of allocation rules. It is worth noting that this allocation rule can potentially be extended to games situated on multigraphs as well as hypergraphs, a direction we intend to explore in our forthcoming research endeavors."
