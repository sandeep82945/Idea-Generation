    "abstractText": "The efficacy of pure and aluminum (Al)-doped boron nitride nanocarriers (B12N12 and AlB11N12) in adsorbing Chlormethine (CM), an anti-cancer drug, was comparatively dissected by means of the density functional theory method. The CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12 and \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 complexes were studied within two configurations, A and B, in which the adsorption process occurred via N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 and Cl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B/Al interactions, respectively. The electrostatic potential affirmations confirmed the opulent ability of the studied nanocarriers to engage in delivering CM via two prominent electrophilic sites (B and Al). Furthermore, the adsorption process within the CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 complexes was noticed to be more favorable compared to that within the CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12 analog and showed interaction and adsorption energy values up to \u201359.68 and \u221252.40 kcal/mol, respectively, for configuration A. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory results indicated that electrostatic forces were dominant in the adsorption process. Notably, the adsorption of CM over B12N12 and AlB11N12 nanocarriers exhibited predominant changes in their electronic properties. An elemental alteration was also revealed for the softness and hardness of B12N12 and AlB11N12 nanocarriers before and following the CM adsorption. Spontaneity and exothermic nature were obviously observed for the studied complexes and confirmed by the negative values of thermodynamic parameters. In line with energetic manifestation, Gibbs free energy and enthalpy change were drastically increased by the Al doping process, with values raised to \u201337.15 and \u201350.14 kcal/mol, respectively, for configuration A of the CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 complex. Conspicuous enhancement was noticed for the adsorption process in the water phase more than that in the gas phase and confirmed by the negative values of the solvation energy up to \u221253.50 kcal/mol for configuration A of the CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 complex. The obtained outcomes would be the linchpin for the future utilization of boron nitride as a nanocarrier.",

            "text": "Owing to the tremendous blossoming of nanoscience in recent years, nanomaterials have been considered as potential candidates in a large array of applications such as optical devices [1], catalysis [2], and sensing materials [3]. Among the growing applications of nanomaterials, nanocarriers are of keen interest given their pivotal importance in the drug\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1181. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15101181 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1181 2 of 18\ndelivery process [4,5]. In the extending field of nanocarriers, fullerene-like structures were proved as potent drug nanocarriers, inspired by high biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity nature [6\u20138]. In the literature, group III nitride nanocarriers were found with exceptional properties, including elevated chemical stability, favorable band gap, suitable dielectric constant, considerable thermal conductivity, and upright oxidation resistance [9,10]. Furthermore, different geometries of boron nitrides (BxNx, where x refers to the number of boron and nitrogen atoms) were studied by Toftlund and Jensen, and the high stability of the B12N12 nanocarrier was addressed [11]. Soltani et al. confirmed that B12N12 was more preferable than B16N16 in the drug delivery process of a 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-AVA) drug [12]. By an arc-melting method, B12N12 was first synthesized with a band gap of 5.1 eV [13,14]. Afterward, B12N12 was extensively investigated to serve as a nanocarrier of diverse anti-cancer drugs such as Isoniazid [6], Amphetamine [15], Lomustine [16], etc. Consequently, the optical, electronic, and chemical features of the boron nitride (B12N12) nanocarrier were thoroughly under study. It was reported that a significant alteration in boron nitride features occurred through doping the B12N12 surface [17]. Concurrently, the aluminum (Al) atom is considered one of the most appropriate doping candidates due to its high porosity and ample surface active sites [18]. In fact, Al-doped boron nitride (AlB11N12) was reported as an excellent nanocarrier for several drugs, owing to the sharp changes in the band gap and the reversibility of the adsorption process [19]. In parallel, the AlB11N12 nanocarrier had a massive increment in its adsorption tendency, which was previously interpreted as an advantage of the Al doping processs [20,21]. Moreover, the adsorption processes of 5-aminosalicylic acid and the Cisplatin anti-cancer drug over the exterior surface of pristine and Al-doped B12N12 nanocarriers were investigated based on DFT calculations [22,23]. Chlormethine (CM), an anti-cancer drug with C5H11Cl2N chemical formula, was synthesized in 1935 and applied for cancer treatment in 1946. Pharmacologists proved the effectiveness of CM to treat prostate cancer, polycythemia vera, chronic myelocytic leukemia, and lymphosarcoma after clinical trials. Moreover, the topical formulation of CM was documented to be operative for different conditions such as skin diseases and cell lymphoma [24\u201326]. Nevertheless, CM had severe adverse effects that would eventually develop tentative blindness and skin cancer. With the aim of reducing undesirable side effects, versatile studies were conducted for using nanocarriers in the delivery process of CM. Subsequently, the adsorption process of CM over C24, B12C6N6, and B12N12 nanocarriers was investigated, revealing the crucial favorability for the B12N12 nanocarrier [27]. Moreover, the effect of transition metal-doped boron nitride was theoretically studied over the surfaces of the B12N12, ZnB12N12, NiB12N12, CoB12N12, FeB12N12, and CuB12N12 nanocarriers [28]. In the current investigation, the predilection of pure and Al-doped boron nitride nanocarriers (B12N12 and AlB11N12) to adsorb CM anti-cancer drug within configurations A and B was discussed (Figure 1). By means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the occurrences of the adsorption process within the CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12 and \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 complexes were detected in both gas and water phases. A series of thermodynamic parameters were also computed to elucidate the spontaneity and nature of the adsorption process. The obtained findings would be essential for the development of the applications of pure and doped boron nitride nanocarriers in the drug delivery process of anti-cancer drugs.\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1181 3 of 18Pharmaceuticals 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 18\nFigure 1.

Interestingly, the obtained bond length values were concomitant with previous studies [31,32].

From summarized data in Table 4, the IP, EA, \u00b5, \u03b7, S, \u03c9, and \u03a6 values of B12N12/AlB11N12 were 9.54/9.10 eV, 0.35/2.50 eV, \u20134.94/\u20135.80 eV, 4.60/3.30 eV, 0.22/0.30 eV\u20131, 2.66/5.10 eV, and 5.12/7.05 eV, respectively. Consequently, the Al doping enhanced the properties of the pure boron nitride nanocarrier to be a suitable surface for adsorbing the CM drug by declining and increasing the values of IP/\u03b7 and EA/\u00b5/S/\u03c9/\u03a6, respectively. Moreover, Table 4 offers insight into the substantial effect of the adsorption process of the CM drug over pure and Al-doped boron nitride (B12N12 and AlB11N12) nanocarriers via sizeable changes in the calculated reactivity parameters. As detailed in Table 4, IP values of the B12N12 and AlB11N12 nanocarriers decreased upon contact with the CM drug from 9.54 and 9.10 eV to 8.92 and 8.55 eV, respectively, within configuration A. The same pattern was noticed in the case of \u00b5, \u03c9, and \u03a6, and an irregular pattern was noticed for EA, \u03b7, and S values, which could be ascribed to the main dependence of these values on ELUMO. Overall, the noticeable difference in the global indices of reactivity parameters extensively ensured the adequacy of the B12N12 and AlB11N12 nanocarriers for adsorbing the CM drug, along with highlighting the preferential role of the Al doping process."

The CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12 and \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 complexes were modeled within configurations A and B, in which the adsorption process occurred via N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 and Cl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B/Al interactions (see Figure 1). To follow the drug loading process, CM, B12N12, and AlB11N12 structures were fully optimized at Minnesota 2006 with the double Hartree\u2013 Fock exchange function (M06-2X) [37] along with the 6-311+G** basis set. Based on the optimized structures, electrostatic potential analysis (ESP) was conducted to clarify the electron-rich and -deficient sites over the molecular surface of the investigated systems. To acquire pictorial descriptions, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps were created using electron density envelopes of 0.002 au [30]. Furthermore, using ESP, the numerical description was obtained by executing and extracting surface electrostatic potential extrema (Vs,min/Vs,max) with the help of Multiwfn 3.7 software [38]. Upon CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12 and \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 optimized complexes, adsorption (Eads) and interaction (Eint) energies were calculated, and the counterpoise correction method was considered to abolish the basis set superposition error (BSSE) as follows:\nEads = ECM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12/\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 \u2212 ( ECM + EB12N12/AlB11N12 ) + EBSSE (1)\nEint = ECM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12/\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 \u2212 ( ECM in complex + EB12N12/AlB11N12in complex ) + EBSSE (2)\nwhere ECM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12/\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 , ECM, and EB12N12/AlB11N12 represent energies of the complex, the isolated CM drug, and the isolated B12N12/AlB11N12 nanocarrier, respectively. ECM in complex and EB12N12/AlB11N12in complex are the energies of the CM drug and the B12N12/ AlB11N12 nanocarrier based on their respective coordinates in the optimized CM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12/ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 complexes. To unveil the physical forces that controlled the adsorption process, symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis was executed with the help of the PSI4 package [34]. Using SAPT analysis, total adsorption energies could be portioned into four physical components, namely, electrostatic (Eelst), exchange (Eexch), induction (Eind), and dispersion (Edisp) forces. Within SAPT analysis, the SAPT0 level of truncation was applied, and Total SAPT0 energies were calculated as described in the following equations [39]:\nESAPT0 = Eelst + Eexch + Eind + Edisp (3)\nwhere: Eelst = E (10) elst (4)\nEexch = E (10) exch (5)\nEind = E (20) indresp + E (20) exch\u2212indresp + \u03b4E (2) HFresp (6)\nEdisp = E (20) disp + E (20) exch\u2212disp (7)\nThe calculations of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) in addition to the noncovalent interaction (NCI) index were also performed. Using QTAIM analysis, bond critical points (BCPs) and bond paths (BPs) were induced. Topological features, including total energy density (Hb), Laplacian (\u22072\u03c1b), electron density (\u03c1b), kinetic electron density (Gb), local potential electron energy density (Vb), and negative ratio of kinetic and potential electron energy density (\u2212Gb/Vb), were also calculated. Three-dimensional NCI diagrams were generated and visualized using (\u03bb2)\u03c1 with values from \u20130.035 to 0.020 au and represented by colors ranging from blue to red, respectively. QTAIM and NCI analyses were achieved with the help of Multiwfn 3.7 [38] and pictorially represented using the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) program [40].\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1181 15 of 18\nTo elucidate the electronic parameters, the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) theory was invoked. Within the context of FMOs, the electron density distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were plotted before and after adsorption. In addition, energies of HOMO (EHOMO) and LUMO (ELUMO) were computed. Based on EHOMO and ELUMO values, the Fermi level (EFL) and LUMO\u2013HOMO energy gap (Egap) were calculated by utilizing Equations (8) and (9), respectively.\nEFL = EHOMO + ELUMO \u2212 EHOMO\n2 (8)\nEgap = ELUMO \u2212 EHOMO (9)\nVarious electronic properties, including ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), chemical potential (\u00b5), global hardness (\u03b7), global softness (S), electrophilicity index (\u03c9), and work function (\u03a6), were computed for CM, B12N12, and AlB11N12 molecules before and after adsorption, as follows:\nIP = \u2212EHOMO (10)\nEA = \u2212ELUMO (11)\n\u03b7 = ELUMO \u2212 EHOMO\n2 (12)\n\u00b5 = ELUMO + EHOMO\n2 (13)\ns = 1 \u03b7\n(14)\n\u03c9 = \u00b52\n2\u03b7 (15)\n\u03a6 = VeL(+\u221e) \u2212 EFL (16)\nwhere VeL(+\u221e) is the vacuum-level electrostatic potential that is assumed to be \u2248 0. In parallel, to provide further evidence of the attractive nature of pure and Al-doped (B12N12 and AlB11N12) nanocarriers toward CM adsorption, electrical conductivity was elucidated utilizing the following equation:\n\u03c3 \u03b1 Exp (\u2212Egap\nkT\n) (17)\nwhere \u03c3 refers to electrical conductivity, Egap is the energy gap, k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, and T characterizes temperature. The density of states (DOS) plots were generated using GaussSum software [41]. To explicitly treat the effect of water as a solvent, the polarizable continuum model (PCM) method was applied [42,43]. For the optimized complexes, the solvation (\u2206Esolv) energy was computed as the difference between the total energies in the water and gas phases according to Equation (18). The adsorption energies (Esolventads ) in the water phase were also assessed.\n\u2206Esolv = Esolvent \u2212 Egas (18)\nFor a more quantitative view of favorability, the thermodynamic parameters including changes in Gibbs free energy (\u2206G), enthalpy (\u2206H), and entropy (\u2206S) were calculated for the studied complexes by applying frequency calculations [44]. The change in thermodynamic parameters was presented as the following equation:\n\u2206M = MCM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12/\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 \u2212 ( MCM + MB12N12/AlB11N12 ) + EBSSE (19)\nwhere \u2206M represents the quantity of \u2206G, \u2206H, and \u2206S. Furthermore, MCM\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B12N12/ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AlB11N12 , MCM, and MB12N12/AlB11N12 introduce the G/H/S parameters of the optimized complexes,\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1181 16 of 18\nthe CM drug, and B12N12/AlB11N12 nanocarriers, respectively. In addition, an insightful perspective on the desorption process was gained through calculating recovery time for all considered complexes, as illustrated in the following equation:\nt = v\u22121exp(\u2212\u2206G/KT) (20)\nwhere \u03bd\u22121 addresses the attempt frequency of 10\u201318 s\u22121.
