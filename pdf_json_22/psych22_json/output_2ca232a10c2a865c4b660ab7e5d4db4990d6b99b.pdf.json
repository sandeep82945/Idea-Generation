Design: Population-based cohort study using data from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): Birth-assigned boys and girls born between 2000 and 2003, who self-reported gender incongruence at 11 years (N \u00bc 10,046) and their pubertal developmental stages from age 11 years to every 6 months throughout puberty were included. Intervention(s): Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Mean age differences in months at reaching Tanner stages 2\u20135 for breast or genital development and pubic hair, voice break,first ejaculation,menarche, axillary hair, acne, and the average difference at attaining all pubertalmilestones (primary outcome). Result(s): In total, 549 (5.5% ) adolescents reported part or full gender incongruence at 11 years. Tendencies toward earlier timing of puberty were observed in adolescents who reported part gender incongruence (average difference, birth-assigned boys: 3.2 months [95% confidence interval {CI}: 6.7; 0.3]; birth-assigned girls: 2.0 months [95% CI: 3.9; 0.1]). Tendencies toward earlier timing of puberty were observed in adolescents who reported full gender incongruence (average difference, birth-assigned boys: 2.4 months [95% CI: 5.0; 0.4]; birth-assigned girls: 1.9 months [95% CI: 5.1; 1.2]). Conclusions: The results from this study indicated that birth-assigned boys and girls who reported either part or full gender incongruence tended to reach puberty slightly earlier than those adolescents who reported gender congruence at 11 years of age. Knowledge on the timing of puberty among adolescents who experience gender incongruence is essential to inform mutual decision-making in clinical settings.

Most children can already label and express their gender in early childhood (1), whereas some will believe a mismatch between their biologic sex assigned at birth and their self-identified gender. This is defined as gender incongruence (2). In recent decades, an increase in adolescents who experience gender incongruence has been observed. This rise may lead to increased need for counseling by health care professionals and ultimately therapy of different sorts (3, 4). Children\nVOL. 118 NO. 5 / NOVEMBER 2022\nand adolescents who are gender incongruent may experience psychological difficulties as their secondary sex characteristics mature (5), and some may wish to delay or suppress puberty. Research on puberty, including knowledge about the timing of puberty among adolescents who are gender incongruent is limited. One study (N \u00bc 696 birth-assigned girls) with limited adjustment for important potential confounders found that birth-assigned girls who were gender incongruent, reached timing of puberty earlier than birth-assigned girls from the general population (6). Knowledge on the timing of puberty in adolescents who are gender incongruent is essential to inform mutual decision-making in clinical settings.\nWe investigated whether the timing of puberty in adolescents who reported gender incongruence was different from those who reported gender congruence. We used information from a large Danish Puberty Cohort with self-reported information on potential gender incongruence at 11 years of age and longitudinally collected information on multiple pubertal milestones."

            "text": "This study was based on data from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) (7), including its subcohort: the Puberty Cohort (8). Between 1996 and 2002, Danish women were invited to participate in the DNBC at their first antenatal visit at the general practitioner around gestational week 6\u201312. Approximately 60% of all the invited mothers were recruited, resulting in approximately 92,000 mothers. Around gestational week 17, the mothers were interviewed via telephone regarding lifestyle and health-related factors. At 11 years, the adolescent and the mother were invited to complete a follow-up questionnaire on the adolescent\u2019s health and well-being. In the 11-year follow-up questionnaire, for the first time, the adolescents were asked to report their pubertal development.\nThe Puberty Cohort was established in 2012. Live-born singletons born between 2000 and 2003 whose mothers participated in the first pregnancy interview in the DNBC and had not withdrawn from the DNBC before 2012 were eligible for the Puberty Cohort. Of the 56,641 eligible adolescents, 22,439 were sampled for the Puberty Cohort (8). To ensure a broad exposure contrast, the Puberty Cohort was sampled based on the prenatal exposures hypothesized to be important for onset of pubertal development and combined with a random sample of 8,000 adolescents. The sampling regime is described in detail elsewhere (9). Each adolescent sampled for the Puberty Cohort was invited to respond to a web-based questionnaire regarding their pubertal development every 6 months from 11.5\u201318 years of age or until full sexual maturation (defined as Tanner stage 5 for both pubic hair and breast or genital development). Of the 22,439 participants in the Puberty Cohort, 15,819 (70%) completed at least 1 questionnaire about pubertal development, whereas 10,046 participants also had information on gender incongruence available that was collected in the 11-year follow-up (Fig. 1).\nVOL. 118 NO. 5 / NOVEMBER 2022\nGender Incongruence\nInformation about gender incongruence was derived from the 11-year follow-up in DNBC and grouped into 3 exposure groups. The participants were asked: \u2018\u2018How true is this for you: I would rather be the opposite sex\u2019\u2019with response options: \u2018\u2018not true at all,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018sometimes true,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018certainly true.\u2019\u2019 Participants were grouped as \u2018\u2018gender congruent\u2019\u2019 (reference group) if they answered \u2018\u2018not true at all\u2019\u2019; as \u2018\u2018partly gender incongruent\u2019\u2019 if they answered \u2018\u2018somewhat true\u2019\u2019; and \u2018\u2018fully gender incongruent\u2019\u2019 if they answered \u2018\u2018certainly true.\u2019\u2019 The question was inspired by the Youth Self-Report questionnaire, a standardized self-report questionnaire designed to assess emotional and behavioral functioning in children and young adults aged between 11 and 18 years (10)."

We used a multivariable regression model (STATA's -intreg- package) for censored time-to-event data assuming normally distributed residuals. The assumption of normally distributed residuals was visually inspected by plotting the nonparametric cumulative incidence function of the residuals based on the Turnbull estimator against the parametric cumulative function based on the normal distribution (16). This was checked in R x 64 3.3.1 (R core team, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The plots were compatible with the assumption.\nAdditionally, we obtained a single estimate of the average difference in age at attaining the pubertal milestone by simultaneouslymodeling all pubertalmilestones using H\u20acuber\u2013White robust variance estimation, and thereby, accounting for the dependencies between the individual pubertal milestones and the risk of type I errors because of multiple testing (17, 18).\nInverse probability weights were used as sampling weights to accommodate the sampling strategy used for the Puberty Cohort (9) and as selection weights to minimize the risk of selection bias because of selective nonparticipation (19). The selection weights were calculated as the inverse probability of participation using a logistic regression model of participation status (yes or no). The maternal information (maternal alcohol in first trimester, cohabitation in pregnancy, maternal age at menarche, maternal prepregnancy body mass index, parity, maternal smoking in first trimester, cohabitation, and parental social class) obtained from the first interview in the DNBC were used as explanatory variables to predict participation. (Supplementary Data, available online). Sampling and selection weights were multi-\n940\nplied and included in all analyses.

            "heading": "Strengths and Limitations",
            "text": "The strengths of this study were the large sample size, the collection of detailed information on various covariates, including socioeconomic and prenatal factors, and the measurement of multiple pubertal milestones for each adolescent collected longitudinally throughout puberty. In addition, it is a strength of our study that we used adolescents' perception of their own gender identity as opposed to parental perception about their child's gender identity, because parental perception might be more prone to bias because of stigma or culture.\nOnly 45% of the participants in the Puberty Cohort had information regarding potential gender incongruence available. The impact of gender incongruence on participation is unknown, but participation in the Puberty Cohort was not associated with a marker of age at pubertal development obtained from external registry data, which minimizes the risk of selection bias (20). Additionally, we had detailed information on prenatal factors potentially associated with participation, which was used to calculate the selection weights used in all analyses.\n941\nGender incongruence was self-reported by the participants. The question on the exposure was not a direct measure for gender incongruence and might refer to a transitory \u2018\u2018wish\u2019\u2019 rather than gender identity. The relatively high proportion of adolescents who reported part- or full gender incongruence at 11 years could indicate that this is the case, because the adult prevalence of gender incongruence in Denmark is estimated to be only 0.5 % (21). Further, we cannot rule out that adolescents who had entered the initial stages of puberty at the time of reporting might have been more aware of their gender incongruence because of the bodily changes they were undergoing. This may have led to bias away from the null hypothesis.\nIn contrast to clinical examination, self-reported data on pubertal development may reduce the risk of nonparticipation but comes at the risk of misclassification (8). The information on the pubertal development was self-reported by the\n942\nparticipants every 6 months, minimizing the risk of recall bias. The Tanner stages in the Puberty Cohort have been validated previously and showed fair-to-moderate agreement between self-reported Tanner stages and those obtained by clinical Tanner staging determined by health care professionals (22). As adolescents who experience gender incongruence in general report high body dissatisfaction with their secondary gender characteristics (5, 23), we cannot rule out the risk of differential misclassification of the pubertal milestones. However, we believe it is unlikely that they systematically overreport or underreport their pubertal development, and potential measurement error of the outcome is most likely nondifferential.\nAlthough we have adjusted for multiple potential confounders, it is not possible to rule out residual confounding or bias because of unknown factors. For example, we were not able to adjust for prenatal androgen exposure, although\nVOL. 118 NO. 5 / NOVEMBER 2022\nthis has been suggested as a common cause of both early timing of puberty (24, 25) and gender identity development (26), potentially leading to unmeasured confounding.\nIn Denmark, a gender identity clinic that offers puberty suppression to minors was not established until 2016 (27). Most likely, none of the adolescents in our study has received treatment, and suppression of puberty or cross-hormone therapy has most likely not affected our results."

As health care professionals observe an increase in the number of adolescents, who wish to begin treatment options such as puberty suppression and cross-sex therapy (4, 27, 29), knowledge on the timing of puberty in this population is essential to inform mutual decision-making in clinical settings. The guidelines recommend initiating puberty suppression around Tanner stage 2 (30). Health care professionals should be aware of the declining trend toward earlier puberty in the general population and that adolescents who are gender incongruent, may tend to experience puberty slightly earlier than adolescents who are gender congruent.\nDIALOG: You can discuss this article with its authors and other readers at https://www.fertstertdialog.com/posts/ 34717"
