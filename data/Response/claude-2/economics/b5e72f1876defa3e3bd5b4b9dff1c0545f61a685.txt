 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study following a cohort of women from age 45 through retirement to get more accurate data on how health impacts labor participation over time. 

2. Examine the impact of delayed retirement policies on women's mental health and wellbeing, including measures like stress, life satisfaction, and depression. 

3. Analyze the economic impacts of delayed retirement on women, such as changes in income, savings, spending, and retirement preparation. 

4. Investigate gender differences in the factors influencing retirement decisions, and how delayed retirement policies could impact men and women differently. 

5. Explore the social and familial effects of delayed retirement, including impacts on caregiving, grandparenting, and intergenerational relationships.
