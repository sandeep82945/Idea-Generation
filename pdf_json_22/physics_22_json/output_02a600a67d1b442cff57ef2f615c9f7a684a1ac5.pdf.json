Statistically significant anomalies emerged when measuring the muon magnetic momentum, and very recently when deducing the mass of the W boson. Here we consider a radiative extension of the Standard Model devised to be sufficiently versatile to reconcile the various experimental results while further predicting the existence of new bosons and fermions with a mass spectrum in the TeV energy scale. The resulting spectrum is, therefore, within the energy reach of the proton-proton collisions at the LHC experiments at CERN. The model investigated here allows us to interpolate between composite and elementary extensions of the Standard Model with an emphasis on a new modified Yukawa sector that is needed to accommodate the anomalies. Focusing on the radiative regime of the model, we introduce interesting search channels of immediate impact for the ATLAS and CMS experimental programs such as the associate production of Standard Model particles with either invisible or long-lived particles. We further show how to adapt earlier supersymmetry-motivated searchers of new physics to constrain the spectrum and couplings of the new scalars and fermions. Overall, the new physics template simultaneously accounts for the bulk of the observed experimental anomalies while suggesting a wide spectrum of experimental signatures relevant for the current LHC experiments.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.055033\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn the first two decades of this millennium, increasing experimental evidence of the existence of new physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM) has been accumulated.\nSeveral standard deviations from the SM predictions have been observed when determining the anomalous magnetic moment (g \u2212 2) of the muon by the E821 experiment [1] at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and in the semileptonic decays B \u2192 D\u00f0 \u00del\u03bd [2\u20134] and B \u2192 K\u00f0 \u00dell [5] by the BABAR, Belle, and LHCb Collaborations. These anomalies have been confirmed by the most recent measurement performed by the Muon g \u2212 2 Collaboration at Fermilab [6] and at flavor experiments [7,8]. Notably, the anomalies in the semileptonic B meson decays emerge due to the observed differences between the decay rates in different lepton families, encoded in the ratios RK\u00f0 \u00de and RD\u00f0 \u00de . In the third decade of this century, the CDF II Collaboration at Fermilab offered an unexpected sign of new physics by unveiling the high-precision measurement of the W boson mass [9] from decade-old Tevatron data. The result is 7 standard deviations away from the SM prediction. Even after taking into account higher-order corrections [10] and the proper average with previous measurements [11,12], *g.cacciapaglia@ip2i.in2p3.fr \u2020antimo.cagnotta@unina.it \u2021rcalabrese@na.infn.it \u00a7francesco.carnevali@unina.it \u2225agostino.deiorio@unina.it \u00b6albertoorsomaria.iorio@unina.it **smorisi@na.infn.it \u2020\u2020sannino@cp3.sdu.dk Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The most recent LHCb results [17,18] do, however, show a compatibility of RK\u00f0 \u00de with the SM within 2 standard deviations. All this evidence [12] adds to long-standing indirect hints of NP, most notably the dark matter problem, the origin of neutrino masses that emerge from the observation of neutrino oscillations, and the origin of the baryon asymmetry in the Universe. Models with additional fermions and scalars, which couple to a single SM quark or lepton via new Yukawalike couplings not involving the SM Brout-Englert-Higgs field, are prime candidates to explain the g \u2212 2 anomalies while taking into account the B meson data [19\u201325]. The NP contributions arise at loop level, while additional bounds come, most notably, from B0\u2013B\u03040 mixing and effects on the Z and Higgs bosons couplings to muons. Such models, depending on the quantum numbers of the new states, can also contain a dark matter candidate [23]. A model of this kind has been used in Ref. [26] as a template interpolating perturbative models and strongly interacting models, like technicolorlike ones and models of fundamental partial compositeness [27\u201329]. In the latter limit, the multiplicity of the new fermions and scalars is due to a new confining gauge interaction. The inclusion of the RD\u00f0 \u00de anomalies in this class of models requires further investigation, as loop effects can hardly compete with the treelevel contribution to the B \u2192 D\u00f0 \u00del\u03bd decay processes in the SM. Corrections to the W boson mass can also be explained in the context of this model as coming from additional fermion loops, providing additional constraints on the new particles and couplings. In this paper, we aim to describe the productions and decays of the new families of bosons and fermions in proton-proton collisions, in the conditions akin to the ones provided by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future hadron collider projects. We will, in particular, estimate the limits on the parameter space from current LHC searches and identify promising new channels that deserve further investigation and dedicated searches. We focus on the radiative case, where the new fermions and scalars can be directly produced. In the composite case, they are confined in new meson and baryon states that need to be studied at the LHC via their effective interactions. This article is structured as follows: Section II gives a brief overview of the framework following the notation adopted in Ref. [26], establishing the terminology and the assumptions made in the rest of the paper. Section III describes the signatures that could arise in proton-proton collisions, following different hypotheses on the mass hierarchies and on the parameter range allowed by the precision measurement constraints, while Sec. IV focuses on describing in detail the phenomenological implications at the LHC of one specific decay channel via the\nreinterpretation of one existing search by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. Finally, Sec. V reviews the constraints on the anomalies in the context of this model and draws conclusions on the potential for future studies at the LHC, before the conclusions in Sec. VI."

            "text": "Following Ref. [26], the class of models described here naturally interpolates between dynamical models of electroweak symmetry breaking and perturbative models where radiative corrections contribute to flavor observables. In the latter case, the new strong gauge symmetry is demoted to a global one, acting on the new fermions and scalars, hence simply counting their multiplicity. The main contribution to anomalies, therefore, stems from loop diagrams involving the new fermions and scalars. These loops also contribute to the Yukawa couplings of the SM fermions; hence, one can design models where light fermion masses and flavor structures can be radiatively generated [30]. In this work, we will consider a more general scenario, where direct couplings of the SM fermions to the Higgs boson are also present, and SM fermion masses emerge from a combination of the tree-level couplings and the loop contributions. For concreteness, we will consider a model where the SM is extended by means of a set of Dirac fermions, an SU\u00f02\u00deL doublet FL and two SU\u00f02\u00deL singlets FN and FE, and two scalar fields Sl and Sq. Their assigned quantum numbers are shown in Table I. We can appreciate that the hypercharge of these new fundamental particles is fixed once the parameter Y is chosen. Integer values of Y for the radiative case are not allowed, because they would lead to fractionally charged elementary states, and jYj > 1=2 are not allowed because they would not admit neutral particles. In this paper we will focus our attention on the case Y \u00bc 1=2 [26]. The NP resides in the Yukawa sector of the theory by means of the most general Yukawa Lagrangian involving the new fermions that is also, by construction, invariant under the global GTC symmetry. Besides kinetic terms and masses for the new fermions and scalars, the SM Lagrangian is complemented by the following set of Yukawa-like interactions:\n\u2212LYuk;NP \u00bc yijLLiFL\u00f0SjE\u00de \u00fe yijE\u00f0Ei\u00decF cNSjE \u00fe yijQQiFL\u00f0SjD\u00de\n\u00fe yijD\u00f0Di\u00decF cNSjD \u00fe yijU\u00f0Ui\u00decF cESjD \u00fe ffiffiffi 2 p \u00f0k\u2191FLF cN \u00fe k\u2193FEF cL\u00de\u03a6H \u00fe H:c:; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere FL \u00bc \u00f0F\u2191L;F\u2193L\u00deT with respect to SU\u00f02\u00deL while Q;Uc;Dc; L; Ec are the SM fermions expressed in terms of chiral left-handed spinors. Note also that the SM flavor indices i, j are carried by the scalars. The field \u03a6H is the\n055033-2\nSM Higgs scalar doublet. The complete Lagrangian also contains a generic scalar potential to complement the usual SM Lagrangian. Also, the fields Rc transform as the representation conjugated to R, for example, Uc \u00bc \u00f03\u0304; 1\u00de\u22122=3. Further terms that violate GTC can be added to Eq. (1), and they will be considered in a followup work. For the choice Y \u00bc 1=2 we made in this analysis, the electric charges of the new fermions and scalars are fixed, as reported in Table I.We see thatSq has the same charge as uptype quarks, while F\u2193L and FE are neutral, and F \u2191 L and FN carry positive charge. This implies, for instance, that Sjq can decay into an up-type quark plus a neutral heavy fermion or a down-type quark and a heavy charged fermion. This will be further explored in Sec. III, where a detailed description of the experimental signatures will be given. The scalarsSjl are also neutral: Since, in the absence ofGTC-violating operators the new fermions and scalars cannot decay into SM states, we need the lightest state to be neutral and, therefore, act as a potential dark matter candidate. Having fixed Y, the remaining parameters of themodel are the Yukawamatrices yijQ;U;D, yijL;E, the couplings k\u2191;\u2193, and the masses of the new scalars and fermions."

            "text": "Constraints on NP scenarios coming from heavy meson physics and electroweak (EW) precision measurements can be complemented by direct searches at the LHC. In our radiative model, the masses of the new fermions and scalars are preferably above the EW scale, hence, spanning from a few hundred GeV to a few TeV. As the fermions F and the scalar Sl are colorless, their production at proton-proton colliders will be very small. On the contrary, the Sq scalars carry color charge; hence, they are produced via gluon and quark fusion, gg \u2192 SqS q and qq\u0304 \u2192 SqS q in proton-proton collisions via QCD interactions. Representative leadingorder Feynman diagrams for pair Sq production are shown in Fig. 1. This kind of production mechanism has a limited\ndependence on the parameters of the model. Since the color charge and the spin of Sq are set, the pair production cross section only depends on the massmSq of the new boson and on the multiplicity: namely, NTC and the number of light families. Direct production of a single Sq boson accompanied by one FL or FE=FN fermion is also possible with representative leading-order Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 2. In this case, a NP interaction vertex, e.g.,QSqFL, is necessarily involved; hence, the parton-level cross section depends on the details of the models and on the NP couplings. In particular, left-handed production will depend on the coupling yijQ, while right-handed production will depend on yijU, y ij D.\nThis section will cover possible experimental signatures coming from pair production of Sq bosons, and we will focus on the minimal scenario where only one Sq family is present (and all others are heavier). The experimental signatures of Sq boson pairs produced at the LHC depend on the decay chains allowed within the model. The particular realization of the model described in Sec. II is not fully determined by the precision measurements, which are detailed in Appendix A. In fact, it is the mass of the boson mSq , the masses of both up-type and down-type fermions mF\u2191L and mF\u2193L , the other fermions FE and FN , as well as the coupling strengths that will determine the\n055033-3\npossible decays for the Sq bosons and the respective branching fractions. We describe these final states in two steps: In the first step, we address the direct decays of the Sq boson, which depend on the coupling strengths, i.e., y ij Q, yijU, and y ij D, and on the difference in mass between Sq and the fermions. In the second step, we will describe the possible decay cascades and final states that can arise depending on the mass hierarchy between the various fermions F and Sl. In Sec. IV, we will describe the example of one particular realization that can be used to derive quantitative predictions at the LHC."

            "text": "To properly discuss the phenomenology stemming from Sq pair production, we first need to bring the interactions in Eq. (1) to the mass eigenstate basis. For the scalars, we can assume without loss of generality that the mass matrices are already diagonal; hence, selecting the lightest state consists of fixing the index j in the couplings. In the heavy fermion sector, instead, a mixing is generated by the couplings to the Higgs k\u2191 and k\u2193. This mixing is proportional to the EW scale versus the vectorlike mass of theF fermions; hence, it is typically small. In the following, mainly for simplicity, we will neglect mixing effects. In the quark sector, instead, the flavor mixing cannot be neglected as it plays a crucial role in determining the flavor structure in the Sq coupling. The masses receive a contribution both from a SM-like Yukawa coupling and from\nloops of the new fermions and scalars, similar to the muon mass sketched in Appendix A 1. Hence, the masses to be diagonalized for up- and down-type quarks read\nMiku \u00bc \u00f0ySMu \u00deikvffiffiffi\n2 p \u00feNTC X3 j\u00bc1 \u00f0yijQykjU \u00de 16\u03c02 k\u2191vffiffiffi 2 p Floop\u00f0MjSq ;masses\u00de;\n\u00f02\u00de\nMikd \u00bc \u00f0ySMd \u00deikvffiffiffi\n2 p \u00feNTC X3 j\u00bc1 \u00f0yijQykjD \u00de 16\u03c02 k\u2193vffiffiffi 2 p Floop\u00f0MjSq ;masses\u00de:\n\u00f03\u00de\nThe diagonalization leading to the mass eigenstates, i.e., to the SM quarks, derives from a nontrivial interplay between the SM-like Yukawas and the loop contributions. In general, the flavor structure in the mass matrices is not aligned to the one of the new couplings yQ;U;D. In the mass eigenstate basis, the Yukawa couplings yQ;U;D are rotated by unphysical rotation matrices, which cannot be measured independently from the Yukawa couplings themselves. In the following, we consider the matrices in the mass eigenstate basis without changing the notation for simplicity. Like in the SM, the only rotation matrix that is physical is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) one deriving from a different rotation of the up and down components of the left-handed fields. The couplings of Sjq in the mass eigenstate basis, therefore, read\nquLF \u2193 L\u00f0Sjq\u00de \u21d2 yqjQ qu \u00bc u; c; t; \u00f04\u00de\nqdLF \u2191 L\u00f0Sjq\u00de \u21d2 X a Vqay aj Q qd \u00bc d; s; b; \u00f05\u00de\nqcuRFE cSjq \u21d2 y qj U qu \u00bc u; c; t; \u00f06\u00de\nqcdRFN cSjq \u21d2 y qj D qd \u00bc d; s; b; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere we follow the convention that the CKM rotation is assigned to the couplings of the left-handed down-type quarks. The first step of the Sq decays is induced by the couplings above, as illustrated in Fig. 3. In the following,wewill assume that the couplings yQ are much larger than yU;D; hence, we will only consider the decays in the upper diagrams, which involve the doublet fermionsF\u2191L andF \u2193 L. The reason for this choice is twofold: On the one side, the products yQyU and yQyD control the loop correction to the quarkmasses and they need to be small for light quarks (see also discussion on the muon mass); on the other hand, the constraints discussed in Appendix A prefer larger contributions in the left-handed sector.

            "text": "The decay cascades of the FL, FE, and FN produced in the decays of the Sq bosons depend on the respective masses and the mass of Sl. For simplicity, in the following discussion we will assume that FN and FE are heavier than\nFL, as they do not appear in the decays following the lefthanded coupling dominance. In particular, if F\u2191L is the lightest particle of the model, it will not further decay and, being charged, it will appear as a long-lived charged particle (LLCP). We are implicitly assuming that it will decay via a suppressed higher-order operator in SM states (leptons) outside the detector, as it cannot be stable on cosmological timescales. Instead, if F\u2193L is the lightest particle, being neutral it will result in missing momentum and energy in the detector that we will henceforth shorten as \u201cMET.\u201d Note also that the mass hierarchy between F\u2191L and F\u2193L plays a crucial role: The heavier one will decay into the lighter via a real or virtual W boson. In fact, the two components of the doublet cannot be degenerate. Reproducing the anomaly in the W mass measurement requires a mass split of a few tens of GeV. Even if the mass split vanishes at tree level (for k\u2191 \u00bc k\u2193), one is induced by EW loops, and it amounts to roughly 166 MeV in the large mass limit [31], and it is enough to generate a prompt decay of the heavier into the lightest (plus a charged pion) [32]. Finally, the neutral scalars Sjl couple toFL via the coupling yL; hence, if it is lighter than F \u2191 L and F \u2193 L, the fermions will decay into it, producing missing energy plus a lepton. We assume that the lightest Sjl can be stable and produce MET. The possible decay chains of the fermions F\u2191L and F \u2193 L are described in the following, depending on the mass ordering, and refer to Feynman diagrams shown in Figs. 3 and 4. We distinguish the following cases: (1) mSl > mF\u2191L ; mF\u2193L : The fermions are the lightest\nparticles, but one fermion will decay into the other plus a W boson, either virtual or real. States with either MET or LLCPs are possible, depending on which fermion is the lightest. Representative diagrams for this case are the ones in Figs. 3 and 4, first row.\n(2) mSl < mF\u2191L ; mF\u2193L : The neutral scalar Sl is the lightest particle, and final states involve missing energy from Sl plus at least one lepton, either charged or neutral, from the NP vertex involving Sl andFL. Representative diagrams for this case are the ones in Fig. 4, second row. (3) mSl < mF\u2191L ; mF\u2193L : The scalar Sl is the lightest\nparticle, and final states involve missing energy from the Sl plus at least one lepton from from the NP vertex involving the Sl and the FL or FN. In this case, one fermion will decay in the other one plus a W boson. Representative diagrams for this case are the ones in Fig. 4, third row.\n(4) mF\u2193L < mSl < mF\u2191L or mF\u2191L < mSl < mF\u2193L : In this case, one of the fermions can decay into the Sl that further cascades into the second type of fermion plus a lepton, respectively, charged or neutral for the two cases.\n055033-5\nIt is worthy of note that the difference in mass between the up-type and down-type fermion jmF\u2191L \u2212mF\u2193L j needs to be sizeable and in the range of tens of GeV in order to account for themW measurement, as shown in Appendix A 5. Moreover, jmF\u2191L \u2212mF\u2193L j < mW for the largest part of the parameter space, so the W boson produced in the decays will be virtual in most of the cases. For most parameter choices, mSl is significantly different from mF\u2191L and mF\u2193L ; therefore, scenario 4 from the above list is also unlikely to occur. Table II summarizes all possible decay chains depending on the mass hierarchy. Finally, a note for the Y \u00bc \u22121=2 scenario: While the diagrams are the same as the Y \u00bc 1=2 case, the quantum numbers of the particles are different, as reported in the last column of Table I. This has the consequence that final states still involve either MET or LLCPs, but in this case, an F\u2191L\ncontributes to the MET, while an F\u2193L or an Sl manifests as a LLCP."

The minimal benchmark scenario therefore requires both right-handed couplings to quarks being zero. Hence, our \u201cminimal scenario\u201d consists of nonvanishing yijQ and y ij L , while the other Yukawas are negligible [33]. Furthermore, we will consider only one of the Sq to be light, corresponding to preferential couplings to the third generation of SM fermions. In this section, we will consider this scenario where there is only one value for j \u00bc 3 to reflect that the lightest Sq couples preferably to the third-generation quarks.

            "text": "Quark pairs+missing energy\nThe particular final states that will be detected at a hadron collider, like the LHC, depend on the decays that are possible, and ultimately on the mass hierarchy of the new particles, as described in Sec. III. If we consider as a benchmark a simple scenario where mSl > mF\u2191L\n, mSl > mF\u2193L , and mF\u2193L > mF\u2191L , then each Sq can decay either to an up-type quark plus F\u2193L, or a down-type quark plus F\u2191L. The latter further decays to F \u2193 L plus a virtual W boson. Hence, the detector signatures for a single Sq decay, as from Table II, are a heavy invisible particle manifesting as a MET, plus either an up-type quark or a down-type quark and a lepton-neutrino pair or quark-quark pair from the virtual W boson. While there are not yet dedicated analyses for this specific model at the LHC experiments, the considered production and decay modes share significant similarities with some SUSY scenarios. In particular, production via strong interaction of an Sq pair, and its decay to an invisible fermion plus a quark, shares several\nsimilarities with a pair production of squarks, which then further decay to quarks and neutralinos. We henceforth make use of results from the LHC that explore such signatures, in particular, Refs. [34,35]. For both theNMS andDMS, as at least y33Q and y 23 Q have to be different from zero, both top quarks plusMETand charm quarks plus MET final states need to be studied. The experimental signature for charm and up quarks at the LHC is not distinguishable at the moment, so they both manifest as a jet of hadrons in the detector. The observable quantities of interest in this case are the excluded cross sections for the top quark pair plus neutralino production, and the light quark pair plus neutralino production. It is important to recall that, for the chosen value of the hypercharge, the quantum numbers of the Sq boson are the same as the one of a (right-handed) stop quark, while the quantumnumbers ofF\u2193L andF \u2191 Lmatch those ofHiggsinos, a neutralino and a chargino, respectively. In order to constrain the production cross section of these\nprocesses, we perform the reinterpretation of two analyses studying in an exclusive way the production of quark pairs plus missing energy in the final state.

The former limit can be used to put constraints on the pp \u2192 SqSq , Sq \u2192 tF \u2193 L or Sq \u2192 bF \u2191 L production, and the latter for pp \u2192 SqSq \u2192 cc\u0304\u00fe F\u2193LF\u2193L or pp \u2192 SqSq \u2192 uu\u0304\u00fe F\u2193LF\u2193L. The inclusive cross sections via strong interaction for\npp \u2192 SqSq are identical to the one for pp \u2192 t\u0303t\u0303 multiplied by the number of Sq scalars in the model, i.e., NTC. In particular, the excluded cross section values are taken as a function of the mass of the stop (or light squark) and neutralino, and interpreted as excluded values of the cross section of an Sq and F \u2193 L with the same masses in the F\u2193L \u00fe t\u00f0F\u2193L \u00fe c,F\u2193L \u00fe u) final state. In order to constrain the model, different values of NTC as well as the coupling strengths and branching ratios are considered. The excluded cross sections, therefore, are evaluated as follows from the SUSY searches:\nTABLE III.

By use of Eq. (8), it is possible to translate the upper limits on the branching ratio shown in Fig. 5 to a constraint on y33Q , y 32 Q , and y 31 Q . However, in order to extract constraints on the model, the flavor structure needs to be defined. Once mSq and mF\u2191L are set, Eqs. (A7), (A10), and (A13) allow us to identify a unique value of \u00f0yQy\u2020Q\u00debs. By exploiting the relations in Eqs. (13) and (14), it is possible to identify a range for y33Q , y 32 Q . If all are\nexcluded, then the model for that combination of mSq , mF , and NTC is excluded. Figure 6, left, shows the limit on \u00f0yQy\u2020Q\u00debs as a function of NTC and mSq , by keeping mF\u2193L fixed at 0.1 TeV. Finally, Fig. 6, right, shows the maximum value ofmF\u2193L excluded as a function ofNTC andmSq . Those values allow us to strongly constrain the model for values of mSq in the 0.7 TeV range, but only larger NTC are excluded for values of mSq above 1 TeV."

The limits are evaluated for two different values of \u0394a\u03bc: First, only dispersive measurements from Refs. [6,36\u201356] are considered, then the entire analysis is repeated by taking into account the most recent values from lattice calculations as reported in Ref.

In other scenarios reported in Sec. III, such results only partially constrain the model, as there is freedom for the Sq boson to decay through different decay chains with respect to the ones considered in Sec. IV. Dedicated analyses on protonproton collision data, searching for LLCPs, or MET plus quarks and leptons, as described in Table II, would allow us to detect the model\u2019s signals for not-yet-excluded scenarios. Even in the absence of a signal, an analysis similar to the one presented in Sec. III can be applied to further constrain the model."

            "text": "For the past decades, several extensions of the SM have been put forward ranging from the time-honored minimal supersymmetric version to composite and radiative realizations including extra dimensions. At the same time, evidence is being accumulated experimentally indicating the existence of new physics beyond the SM. The goal of this work is to establish a phenomenological template mimicking different models from radiative to composite, depending on how the underlying dynamics is realized, and show that it can also be adopted as an experimental template of new physics by either suggesting new searches or adapting earlier ones to either discover or constrain the parameter space of the theory. Another crucial aspect is that the model is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the various observed SM anomalies. Specifically, as a first step, we consider a radiative extension of the SM that reconciles the various experimental results while further predicting the existence of new bosons and fermions with a mass spectrum in the TeV energy scale. The resulting spectrum is, therefore, within the reach of the LHC experiments. We suggest new interesting search strategies including the associate production of SM particles with invisible or long-lived charged particles. We further show that it is possible to employ earlier SUSY-inspired searches to constrain the spectrum and couplings of the newly introduced particles. We also check that the template is sufficiently rich to accommodate the observed experimental anomalies while allowing for new experimental signatures at the LHC."

            "text": "The new Yukawa interactions in Eq. (1) contribute at one-loop level to all SM fermion masses, in addition to the SM-like Yukawa couplings. In fact, all masses could be generated radiatively, except for the top quark one, whose Yukawa coupling is of order one. In a general setup, cancellations may occur between the tree-level coupling and the loops; hence, one could have sizeable modifications of the Higgs coupling to the fermions. As we are interested in anomalies in the muon sector, below we illustrate this effect for the muon. Schematically, ignoring lepton flavor mixing terms, the muon mass will be given by two competing terms:\nm\u03bc \u00bc ySM\u03bc vffiffiffi\n2 p \u00fe \u03b4mloop\u03bc ;\n\u03b4mloop\u03bc \u00bc NTC \u00f0yLyE\u00de\u03bc\u03bc 16\u03c02 k\u2191vffiffiffi 2 p Floop\u00f0masses\u00de; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere Floop is an order one function of the mass parameters [30], and m\u03bc is the measured muon mass. The physical coupling of the Higgs boson to muons also receives a correction with respect to the SM value given schematically by\nyeff\u03bc \u00bcySM\u03bc 1\u00fe\u03b4m\nloop \u03bc\nm\u03bc k2\u2191Gloop\u00f0masses\u00de ; ySM\u03bc \u00bc\nffiffiffi 2 p m\u03bc v ;\n\u00f0A2\u00de\nwhere the function Gloop depends on the mass parameters. Evidence for this coupling has been recently obtained at the LHC Run-2 by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [58,59]: Current data are consistent with the SM value at the 43% level, while projections for the full run of the LHC indicate that precision below 5% is achievable [60].\n055033-10\nHence, the correction encoded in the second term in the parentheses of Eq. (A2), proportional to \u03b4mloop\u03bc , must be smaller than unity in absolute value. If we allow for cancellations between the two terms in Eq. (A1), large muon couplings to the new fermions and scalars could generate \u03b4mloop\u03bc \u226b m\u03bc, hence, dangerously enhancing the correction to the muon Higgs coupling. There are two ways out: The coupling k\u2191 could be small, however suppressing the radiatively induced SM fermion masses to be of the order of the muon mass for all downtype fermions, or we could ask the product \u00f0yLyE\u00de\u03bc\u03bc to be small for muons. Sizeable effects in muon physics are preserved if yL is sizeable while yE is small, as also preferred by RK (as we will see below). In this work, we will follow the latter possibility. In summary, as long as \u00f0yLyE\u00de\u03bc\u03bc \u223cm\u03bc=v via a small yE, the correction to the Higgs coupling to muons is under control without affecting the observables in the muon anomalies."

[75] reported in the following:\nS \u00bc \u221216\u03c0\u03a03Y\u00f0M 2 Z\u00de \u2212 \u03a03Y\u00f00\u00de M2Z ; T \u00bc 4\u03c0\u03a011\u00f00\u00de \u2212 \u03a033\u00f00\u00de s2Wc 2 WM 2 Z ; \u00f0A20\u00de\nwhere sW \u00bc sin \u03b8W and cW \u00bc cos \u03b8W , \u03b8W being the Weinberg angle defined at the scale \u03bc \u00bc MZ, \u03a03Y is the vacuum polarization of one ispospin and one hypercharge current, while \u03a011 and \u03a033 are the vacuum polarization of the isospin currents. We illustrate the impact of the W boson mass measurement on EW physics in Fig. 12, where a red star indicates the SM prediction at one-loop level, which corresponds to T \u00bc S \u00bc 0. The black dot marks the observed value for the oblique parameters without including the CDF result, corresponding to T \u00bc 0.09 0.14, S \u00bc 0.04 0.11, with a covariance of \u03c1 \u00bc 0.92 [76]. The dashed orange ellipse and the shaded orange ellipse correspond, respectively, to the covariance ellipse drawn at 1\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 of the oblique parameters measure. They include several EW precision measurements, including the W boson mass: To separate its impact, we show the determination of T and S from separate sources. The light yellow dashed lines and the yellow region correspond to the bound originating from asymmetries measured at LEP experiments and from the determination of sin2 \u03b8effW . The pink dashed line and the pink region is driven by the CDF mass measurementMW jCDF within 1\u03c3 and 3\u03c3, respectively. The same reasoning applies to the light violet dashed lines and light violet region, which are relative to the average estimation MW jAVG. We remark that the new measurement pushes the preferred region toward positive values of T with respect to the SM and the old results. This is confirmed by new EW fits that include the CDF result in the average [14,15] or in replace of the old values [16]. Hence, the new\nphysics effect must be related to some breaking of the custodial symmetry defined in the SM Higgs sector. In the radiative model under investigation, this effect may dominantly arise from a mass difference between the components of the doublet of fermions F\u2191L and F \u2193 L, which contribute at one-loop level to the W boson mass. In Fig. 13, we show the relevant diagram for this correction. This effect can be expressed in terms of the oblique parameters in Eq. (A20), which take the following expressions:\nS \u00bc NTC 6\u03c0 2\u00f04Y \u00fe 3\u00dex1 \u00fe 2\u00f0\u22124Y \u00fe 3\u00dex2 \u2212 2Y ln x1 x2 \u00fe\n3 2 \u00fe 2Y x1 \u00fe Y g\u00f0x1\u00de \u00fe\n3 2 \u2212 2Y x2 \u2212 Y g\u00f0x2\u00de ;\nT \u00bc NTC 8\u03c0s2Wc 2 W f\u00f0x1; x2\u00de; \u00f0A21\u00de\nwhere x1 \u00bc \u00f0mF\u2191L=MZ\u00de 2, x2 \u00bc \u00f0mF\u2193L=MZ\u00de 2, and\nf\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc x1 \u00fe x2\n2 \u2212 x1x2 x1 \u2212 x2 ln x1 x2 ;\ng\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u22124 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4x \u2212 1 p arctan\n1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4x \u2212 1 p : \u00f0A22\u00de\nFor equal masses x1 \u00bc x2, the contribution to T vanishes as f\u00f0x; x\u00de \u00bc 0. This is clearly understood as such a mass difference can only occur via breaking of the weak isospin, which is generated by the mixing induced by the couplings\n055033-14\nk\u2191 \u2260 k\u2193. Hence, the states running in the loop should be the final mass eigenstates after diagonalization. The results in Eq. (A21) are valid in the limit of small mixing. In Fig. 14 on the left (right) panel, we show the parameter space region that is able to explain \u0394MW jCDF (\u0394MW jAVG) within 3\u03c3 for fixed values of NTC, corresponding to different color shading. The dashed lines represent the agreement within 1\u03c3 with the experimental measurements. The plot investigates the dependence on the FL mass versus the mass difference: The horizontal lines correspond to mass splits equal to MW reported as a reference. In the region above (below) the top (bottom) line, decays among the two components are kinematically open, hence allowing the on-shell decay\nFL\u2191 \u2192 W\u2212 \u00fe FL\u2193\u00f0FL\u2193 \u2192 W\u00fe \u00fe FL\u2191\u00de: \u00f0A23\u00de\nThe plots show that, for NTC > 1, the mass splits are required to be smaller than the W mass, but still sizeable. Henceforth, the above decays can still occur via an off-shell W boson. If the isospin breaking in the fermion sector is too small, the leading effect may arise at two-loop level, involving the couplings yijQ with the third-generation quarks. The mass difference between top and bottom already induces a sizeable isospin violation, while the loop suppression can be compensated by the large yQ couplings of the thirdgeneration quarks."
