    "abstractText": "The correlation between empathy and customer responses may be a key to solve the problem of classical furniture advertising design. To explore the relationship between empathy and consumer purchasing response, this study proposes a model of dual path mechanism of empathy influencing consumer purchase intentions in classical furniture through advertising design related to furniture brand Tanjuyuan. The results not only prove the hypotheses, but also indicate that: (1) cultural empathy and empathy fusion have a more significant impact on consumers\u2019 purchase intention than practical empathy; (2) cultural empathy plays a dominant role in influencing consumers\u2019 purchase intention; (3) empathy fusion is a key mediator between cultural empathy and practical empathy in influencing consumers\u2019 purchase intention. These findings provide issues for subsequent research from various perspectives, such as enhancing the practical perceptions of consumers of classical furniture products, cultural value perceptions, and the interdisciplinary application of empathy.",

To explore the\nrelationship between empathy and consumer purchasing response, this study\nproposes a model of dual path mechanism of empathy influencing consumer\npurchase intentions in classical furniture through advertising design related to\nfurniture brand Tanjuyuan. The results not only prove the hypotheses, but also\nindicate that: (1) cultural empathy and empathy fusion have a more significant\nimpact on consumers\u2019 purchase intention than practical empathy; (2) cultural\nempathy plays a dominant role in influencing consumers\u2019 purchase intention;\n(3) empathy fusion is a key mediator between cultural empathy and practical\nempathy in influencing consumers\u2019 purchase intention. These findings provide\nissues for subsequent research from various perspectives, such as enhancing\nthe practical perceptions of consumers of classical furniture products, cultural\nvalue perceptions, and the interdisciplinary application of empathy.\nKEYWORDS\nclassical furniture, furniture brand Tanjuyuan, practical empathy, cultural empathy, customer response\nIntroduction\nEmpathy may be\u00a0a key to the design and promotion of classical furniture advertising. Classical furniture advertisement is usually designed to change consumers\u2019 original cognition of classical furniture products, control consumers\u2019 emotions, and further achieve a change in consumer behavioral decisions. Advertising designers should recognize that consumer behaviors are influenced by the design and promotion of their advertisement. With the coming of consumer experience-centered era, factors that influence or determine consumer behavior decisions are also gradually changing (Deng et\u00a0al., 2022; Li et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2022). When purchasing classical furniture products, consumers shift their attention from product attribute to value attribute, and the increasing consumption awareness makes consumers pay more attention to the emotional experience in shopping process. However, existing advertising promotions still have not realized the change of focus from product to people. Furthermore, the decision-making process of consumer,\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 27 September 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.999631"

Therefore, the key issue in the design and promotion of classical furniture advertising is how to create content that could stimulate consumers\u2019 purchase intention.\nIn recent years, some scholars have found that empathy can have a positive impact on consumers\u2019 purchase intention, and then promote their consumptions (Gillani et\u00a0al., 2021; Jing et\u00a0al., 2022; Yi et\u00a0al., 2022). Why does empathy affect consumer behavior? This is because empathy and consumer behavioral decision share the same attributes in the psychological context. Empathy can help create a psychological resonance between consumers, which in turn affects consumers\u2019 perception of classical furniture products and further change their behavioral decision. In addition, the empathy fusion in the design and promotion of classical furniture advertising can better meets the emotional needs of consumers and helps the brand achieve value enhancement, as well as perpetuates the vitality of classical furniture products and enhances the brand awareness. To implement the consumercentered concept in the design and promotion of classical furniture advertising, designers need to study deeply how to give the product a richer cultural connotation, in order to trigger consumer empathy and stimulate their purchase behavior.\nIn existing research, scholars have conducted relatively abundant research on empathy theory, consumer behavioral decision, and factors that influence consumer behavioral decision in advertising design. However, they have not explored these issues in a unified framework for discussion. There are several key issues that need to be\u00a0 addressed: First, is there a correlation between consumer behavioral decision and empathy? Second, how does advertisement influence consumers\u2019 behavioral decision? Third, how can empathy be\u00a0 used in the design and promotion of classical furniture advertising to influence consumers\u2019 purchasing decision?\nIn response to above questions, this study employs literature review, theoretical analysis, questionnaire survey and empirical analysis as research methods. This study selects pictures of products of Tanjuyuan, a representative brand in the classical furniture, as the experimental object, and collects data through questionnaire survey with considering the authenticity, validity, and availability of data sources. From theoretical point of view, this study innovatively proposes the possible correlation between consumer behavioral decision and empathy theory, enriches the connotation of empathy theory, broadens the application of empathy theory, and successfully constructs and verifies the dual path model of practical empathy and cultural empathy into consumer purchase decision in the process of classical furniture advertising design promotion. From the practical point of view, the study tested the validity of the empathy scale and the consumer purchase intention scale, pushing the classical furniture advertising design into a new dimension. The study also validates and analyzes the paths through which empathy affects consumers\u2019 purchase intentions, providing complete\ntheoretical support and reliable data on how to apply empathy in the design and promotion of classical furniture advertisements. Finally, this study opens a new perspective of classical furniture products from consumers, and it provides a basis for subsequent research on the of empathy communication for other products.\nBased on the above three key issues, this study first makes the theoretical analysis to sort out the commonality between empathy and consumer behavioral decision and explores the mechanism of empathy influencing the consumers\u2019 purchase intention of classical furniture. Second, this study collects the data of consumers\u2019 empathy and purchase intention related to classical furniture advertising through questionnaire survey. Finally, this study applies exploratory factor analysis and validation factor analysis to verify the reliability of the dual path mechanism of empathy affects consumers\u2019 purchase intention."

            "text": "Empathy and consumer behavioral decisions There is no universal definition of empathy in academia. Tracing its roots, the concept of empathy emerged from psychology and has been enriched by interdisciplinary research. Throughout the research of scholars, empathy refers to the ability of individuals to perceive or imagine the emotional state of others, understand and experience the emotions of others, then make a certain response (Rivas and Husein, 2022). Instead of being an emotion, empathy is a process of experiencing another person\u2019s emotions, emphasizing the ability to resonate with others and having the following three characteristics. First, empathy is objective and fact-based, which has three stages of emotional contagion, perspective taking and empathic concern (Hogan, 1969; Eklund and Meranius, 2021). Second, empathy is heterogeneous. Depending on the target and the situation, there are also significant differences in the strength of empathy generated (Barker et\u00a0al., 2022). Third, the evolution of empathy could be\u00a0both positive and negative. Positive empathy is a process of understanding and indirectly sharing others\u2019 positive emotional states, while the negative empathy is a process of understanding and indirectly sharing others\u2019 negative emotional states. Empathy is a genetically rooted unconscious ability that can be\u00a0either a cognitive outcome or an emotional state. From the perspective of structure, empathy is multidimensional and generally includes affective empathy and cognitive empathy (Gong et\u00a0 al., 2020; Pedersen, 2021; Weisz et\u00a0al., 2022). Specifically, affective empathy refers to that individuals can produce alternative responses to others\u2019 emotions. It is a bottom-up emotion, which generally follows the Perception-Action model. Cognitive empathy refers to individuals\u2019 ability to recognize others\u2019 emotions and understand others\u2019 views. It is a top-down emotion that involves selfobjectification (Ohba and Deen, 2022).\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nConsumer behavioral decision refers to the process in which consumers are motivated to purchase based on their own needs, form their own cognition, and generate corresponding emotion by perceiving the received product information, engage in purchasing behavior finally (Leung et\u00a0al., 2022; Sajja, 2022). The process of consumer behavioral decision consists of three aspects: cognitive analysis of products, emotional inspiration, and purchase behavior (Shen and Wang, 2022), with a causal relationship between the first two and the latter one. Among them, consumption cognition is the subconscious memory of products, changes in consumption structure and belief content, whereas consumption emotion is the aesthetic and hedonic feelings experienced by consumers in the process of purchasing (Du and Lin, 2022; Luqman et\u00a0al., 2017).\nEmpathy is consistent with consumer behavioral decisions. Empathy and consumer behavior decision making are highly similar in attributes, both belong to psychology; they are also highly compatible in essence, both are a kind of cognition of individuals; and they are structurally identical, both contain cognitive and emotional dimensions. Therefore, it is of practical significance and theoretical value to explore whether empathy theory affects consumers\u2019 purchase decisions.\nEmpathy in the advertising design and promotion of classical furniture\nThe consumer behavioral decision in the advertising design and promotion of classical furniture refers to a process of consumers selecting, absorbing and processing the received advertising information to form a unique judgment about of classical products, and then generates the consumption cognition and stimulates consumption emotion of classical furniture products, and finally make the purchase decision (Sun et\u00a0al., 2022). The role of classical furniture advertising design and promotion is to transform consumers\u2019 perceptions and influence their behavior (Anghel, 2022). In the literature of advertising, the information that affect consumer behavioral decision are diverse, not only including explicit visual information that displays the appearance, quality and function of products, but also implicit conceptual information that contains cultural elements such as values and social consensus (Cai, 2017; Majer et\u00a0 al., 2022; Martin\u010di\u0107 et\u00a0 al., 2022). Furthermore, according to the means of consumers receiving advertisements, the sources of information can be\u00a0divided into direct reception and indirect reception (Miliano et\u00a0al., 2018). Direct reception refers to advertising that presents products directly to consumers in a visual form, including linguistic features, display methods and techniques, which directly affects consumers\u2019 information processing and leads to consumer emotions about classical furniture, ultimately affects consumers\u2019 purchase decision-making (Farshbaf-Geranmayeh et\u00a0al., 2018). The direct reception is relatively objective, in which the information for consumer behavioral decision is only based on the practical characteristics of the products and personal subjective emotional perception, and consumers will only\nempathize with the product itself. The indirect reception refers to consumers\u2019 sharing of information through other people\u2019s re-creation of product advertising content (Lee and Lee, 2016), and forming their own unique opinions through empathizing or value judgment. Therefore, the information source of consumer behavioral decision in the advertising design and promotion is mainly the practicality and cultural value of classical furniture products.\nBased on the theory of empathy and consumer behavioral decision, this study believes that empathy in the advertising design and promotion of classical furniture refers to the ability of consumers to resonate with other consumers\u2019 attitudes toward classical furniture products both cognitively and emotionally, and to show a desire to buy and share. Since classical furniture has dual attributes of product and culture, and the information source of consumer behavioral decision also has the distinction of explicit visual information and implicit conceptual information, a distinction should be\u00a0made when analyzing the empathy generated by consumers. Pragmatic empathy based on classical furniture product attributes and explicit visual information, refers to the resonance ability generated by the practical experience of consumers and other consumers in the appearance, quality and safety of classical furniture products. Cultural empathy based on the cultural attributes of classical furniture products and implicit conceptual information, refers to the resonance ability of consumers to resonate with each other in terms of cultural connotations and historical origins of classical furniture products. It is worth emphasizing that the characteristics of pragmatic empathy and cultural empathy have not changed in the process of advertising design and promotion of classical furniture which still retain objectivity, heterogeneity, and differences of evolution trend."

            "text": "Overall, scholars have conducted relatively detailed research on empathy theory, consumer behavioral decision, and advertisement design and promotion. Studies on empathy have defined the concept, discussed the characteristics, and analyzed the structure. The study of consumer behavioral decision making is more generally based on a psychological perspective. Research on advertising design and promotion has mainly focused on the influence of the context, situation and visual design of the advertisement itself on consumer decision making. However, empathy, advertising design and promotion, and consumer behavioral decision making have not been explored in a unified framework. The following points need to be\u00a0 further explored. Firstly, it is known that consumer behavioral decision-making is highly consistent with empathy in terms of attributes, but the correlation between the two needs a further refinement study. Secondly, there are relatively few studies on consumer behavioral decision in the advertising design and promotion of classical furniture, so detailed research needs to be\u00a0conducted into this field. Finally, solutions are needed to apply the dual path mechanism of practical empathy and cultural empathy to the design and promotion of classical furniture advertisements, in\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\norder to achieve more effective influence on consumers\u2019 purchase decisions."

            "text": "Practical empathy and purchase intention Based on the product attributes of classical furniture, there is a path for practical empathy to affect consumer behavioral decisions. In the advertising design and promotion of classical furniture, the information that affects consumer behavioral decisions is mainly explicit visual information that demonstrates the appearance, quality and function of products (Anderson and Laverie, 2022; Cai, 2022a). Therefore, the research on how the practical empathy affecting purchase intention mainly focuses on four dimensions of product appearance, product quality, product safety and product trust (Chaerudin and Syafarudin, 2021). The appearance of products is the basic factor that affects consumers\u2019 preferences, product quality is the main factor that affects consumers\u2019 purchase intention, product safety is the potential factor that affects consumers\u2019 purchase intention, and product trust is the core factor that affects consumers\u2019 repeated purchase (Veselovsk\u00e1, 2022; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022). Therefore, in the process of practical empathy, consumers use their imagination and cognition to select their own unique viewpoints on products. Due to the emotional influence of other people\u2019s attitudes towards product appearance, quality, safety and trust, resulting in positive or negative empathic concerns and finally influencing consumers\u2019 purchase intention (Nguyen and Chao, 2021). Therefore, this study proposes the following hypothesis:\nH1: Practical empathy has a positive effect on the consumers\u2019 purchase intention of classical furniture products.\nCultural empathy and purchase intention Based on the cultural attributes of classical furniture products, there exists a path for cultural empathy to affect consumer behavioral decisions in the advertising design promotion of classical furniture, the information that affects consumer behavioral decisions comes from implicit conceptual information containing many cultural elements such as classical furniture culture, value and social consensus (Cai and Zhou, 2021; Reyes-Menendez et\u00a0al., 2022). In the process of empathic communication of classical furniture culture, consumers develop cultural perceptions and emotional states similar to other consumers, through alternative experiences of their cultural emotions of classical furniture (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, the research on the path of cultural empathy affecting consumers\u2019 purchase intention mainly focuses on cultural elements such as cultural theme, historical origin, craftsmanship and cultural identity of classical furniture products (Swami et\u00a0 al., 2022). Among them, cultural theme is the outermost factor that attracts consumers\u2019 attention, historical origin is the potential factor of\nconsumers\u2019 understanding, craftsmanship is the key element of consumers\u2019 value perception, and cultural identity is the decisive factor of consumers\u2019 empathy and purchase behavior (Jamal and Sharifuddin, 2015). In the generation process of empathy on classical furniture culture, consumers are influenced by others\u2019 evaluation and experience of multi-dimensional cultural elements of classical furniture products, resulting in cultural emotional contagion, combining with their own imagination and cognition of classical furniture culture to make \u201cperspectivetaking,\u201d and finally generate sharing or purchasing behaviors based on the results of empathic concerns (Sharifi-Tehrani et\u00a0al., 2022; Cai, 2022b). Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:\nH2: Cultural empathy has a positive effect on the consumers\u2019 purchase intention of classical furniture products.\nPractical empathy, cultural empathy and purchase intention\nPractical empathy is the foundation of cultural empathy, and cultural empathy is the superstructure of practical empathy, and there is both a bottom-up and top-down logical relationship between the above two. Consumers buy classical furniture products to meet their consumption needs, which can be\u00a0based on a lower level of material need arising from the product itself which is the lowest level of needs or a higher level of the spiritual need arising from the product culture (Palumbo et\u00a0al., 2021). Only when consumers\u2019 practical material needs are satisfied can they seek to satisfy their cultural spiritual needs (Lienert, 2015). The logical sequence of practical empathy followed by cultural empathy provides theoretical support for the emergence of cultural empathy among consumers (Yi et\u00a0al., 2022). Cultural empathy, influencing practical empathy from top to bottom, reinforces the effect of fusion empathy communication, thereby increasing the purchase intention of consumers (Hyun Park et\u00a0al., 2017). Practical empathy modifies consumers\u2019 perceptions of the practicality of classical furniture products and stimulates positive emotions about the products from the surface; cultural empathy modifies consumers\u2019 perceptions of the cultural characteristics of classical furniture products and stimulates positive emotions about the products from the inside, and the two interact to form fusion empathy, which ultimately influences consumers\u2019 purchase decisions (Everson et\u00a0 al., 2015). Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:\nH3: Practical empathy moderating the effect between cultural empathy and the consumers\u2019 purchase intention of classical furniture products.\nH4: Cultural empathy mediating the relationship between practical empathy affecting and consumers\u2019 purchase intention on classical furniture products.\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nPractical and cultural empathy can independently influence consumers\u2019 purchase intentions, while practical empathy acts on cultural empathy to form a fusion of empathy that will ultimately affect consumers\u2019 consumption behavior decisions as well. The overall paths of empathy affecting consumers are shown in Figure\u00a01."

This study adopted the experimental method of questionnaire survey to verify the hypotheses of empathy paths in the advertising design of classical furniture.\nThis study constructed an empathy measurement scale for the advertising design promotion of classical furniture, considering the research object, based on the Interpersonal Relationship Indicator Scale (IRI; Ingoglia et\u00a0al., 2016; Fultz and Bernieri, 2022) and Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE; \u015eakir et\u00a0al., 2021), which are widely used in empathy measurement. To verify the rationality of the empathy scale, the questionnaire data from the pre-study were analyzed for reliability and validity, and the empathy scale was revised and formed for this study. The scale is mainly divided into four parts.\nThe first part is the practical empathy scale, which mainly involves four dimensions of product appearance empathy, product quality empathy, product safety empathy and product trust empathy, with 12 items. The second part is the cultural empathy scale, which mainly includes 12 items of four dimensions related to empathy of cultural theme, cultural origin, craftsmanship and cultural identity. The third part is the integrated empathy scale, which mainly includes three items related to the interaction between practical empathy and cultural empathy.

According to the results of structural equation model analysis, it is clear that practical empathy is the starting point in all four paths of consumer purchase intention, which shows that practical empathy is the basis for the influence of empathy theory to influence consumer behavior decisions. In fact, the effect of practical empathy on consumers\u2019 purchase intention is not significant, but indirectly affects consumers\u2019 behavioral decisions through cultural empathy and empathy fusion. Therefore, the quality of classical furniture products, as the most basic element, should play its role well and update classical furniture products and advertising design according to consumers\u2019 needs and aesthetics in a timely manner, so as to provide consumers with a good consumption experience. Additionally, due to the obvious product attribute and characteristics of classical furniture, the advertising design and promotion should also focus on product appearance, quality and safety. These aspects provide guarantees for consumers\u2019 practical perception and improve their purchase intention.\nSecond, it is necessary to enrich the cultural connotation of classical furniture to ensure consumers\u2019 good cultural value perception. According to the results of structural equation model analysis, cultural empathy not only directly affects consumers\u2019 purchase intention, but also indirectly affects consumers\u2019 purchase intention through the role of empathy fusion. The effect of cultural empathy is related to the effect of cultural cognition and emotional cognition of classical furniture consumers, so classical furniture manufacturers and advertising producers, as the creators of classical furniture product culture, should take more efforts to improve the quality of product cultural content. The focus of cultural themes and the depth of product origin in advertising design of classical furniture are the basic cultural content requirements to enhance the consumers\u2019 purchase intention. Besides, the craftsmanship contained in the production technology is utilized to achieve the consumers\u2019 recognition of the cultural value of classical furniture products and realize consumers\u2019 deep and immersive cultural empathy. The consumers\u2019 cultural consumption needs should be\u00a0well satisfied\nby ensuring their perception of the cultural value of classical furniture and creating a brand of classical furniture with cultural connotation.\nThird, it is necessary to build the interconnection between consumers\u2019 practical and cultural empathy to enhance consumers\u2019 purchase intention. According to the results of structural equation model analysis, empathy fusion is one of the important factors that affect consumers\u2019 purchase intention. In the process of consumption, consumers not only meet their needs of products, but also meet their pursuit of cultural spirit and emotional experience. Therefore, in the advertising design of classical furniture products, we\u00a0should actively integrate practical empathy into cultural empathy to strengthen the interaction of consumers\u2019 cognition and emotional experience of classical furniture products and culture to further enhance consumers\u2019 purchase intention."
