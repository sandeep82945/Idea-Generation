    "abstractText": "Human American trypanosomiasis, called Chagas disease, caused by T. cruzi protozoan infection, represents a major public health problem, with about 7000 annual deaths in Latin America. As part of the search for new and safe anti-Trypanosoma cruzi derivatives involving nitroheterocycles, we report herein the synthesis of ten 1-substituted 2-nitropyrrole compounds and their biological evaluation. After an optimization phase, a convergent synthesis methodology was used to obtain these new final compounds in two steps from the 2-nitropyrrole starting product. All the designed derivatives follow Lipinski\u2019s rule of five. The cytotoxicity evaluation on CHO cells showed no significant cytotoxicity, except for compound 3 (CC50 = 24.3 \u03bcM). Compound 18 appeared to show activity against T. cruzi intracellular amastigotes form (EC50 = 3.6 \u00b1 1.8 \u03bcM) and good selectivity over the vero host cells. Unfortunately, this compound 18 showed an insufficient maximum effect compared to the reference drug (nifurtimox). Whether longer duration treatments may eliminate all parasites remains to be explored.",

            "text": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a flagellate protozoan involved in Chagas disease (Human American trypanosomiasis), a neglected tropical disease causing a major public health problem, with about 7000 annual deaths in Latin America [1]. Although asymptomatic in the acute phase after contamination, cardiac and digestive complications may appear in 20 to 30% of cases during the chronic phase of the disease (inflammatory cardiomyopathy, enlargement of the gastrointestinal tract and organs, and gastrointestinal motor disorders) [2,3]. The anti-trypanosomatid potential of nitroheterocycles is well known, such as benznidazole (2-nitroimidazole) and nifurtimox (5-nitrofuran) listed on the WHO Model list of essential medicines for the treatment of human American trypanosomiasis (Figure 1) [4]. These two compounds represent an important part of the therapeutic arsenal in the management of Chagas disease. However, they are active mainly in the acute and early chronic stage of the disease, but not once in the late stage [5]. Their use is also limited by their toxicity, making the development of new safe and effective drugs against T. cruzi necessary. Recently, an orally available 5-nitroimidazole, fexinidazole, was identified as a promising new drug candidate for the treatment of both stages of human African trypanosomiasis due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection [6]. The clinical evaluation of this compound on\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2163. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27072163 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2163 2 of 17\nthe treatment of adults with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease due to T. cruzi infection is in progress [7,8].\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 16\ntrypanosomiasis due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection [6].

Synthesis of 2-nitropyrrole starting product 1. Scheme 1. Synthesis of 2-nitropyrrole starting product 1.\nThe X-ray crystal structure (Figure 3) was determined for this compound to confirm the regioselective nitration reaction at the 2-position of the pyrrole compound (CCDC 2132900).\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2163 3 of 17\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16\nThe X-ray crystal structure (Figure 3) was determined for this compound to confirm the regioselective nitration reaction at the 2-position of the pyrrole compound (CCDC 2132900).\nFigure 3. X-ray crystal structure of 2-nitropyrrole starting product 1.\nThe pyrrole nitration must be carried out under mild conditions using acetic anhydride as a solvent, because in the presence of sulfuric acid, only the polymerization of the pyrrole was reported, without the formation of the target product [17]. In the reaction conditions described in Scheme 1, we observed the formation of the expected product (1) in good yield, traces of the dinitro pyrrole product observed by LC/MS monitoring but not isolated, as well as a black resin which may correspond to a polymerization side-product, as reported in the literature [17]. Then, we tried two alkylation protocols to obtain the 2-nitropyrrole derivatives functionalized at position N-1. First, we applied the benznidazole alkylation protocol on the 2-nitropyrrole starting product in two steps (Scheme 2) [18].\nScheme 2. Alkylation using the benznidazole alkylation protocol in two steps.\nThe first alkylation step with ethyl bromoacetate led to the desired compound 2 in a 71% yield (Scheme 2, step 1). Unfortunately, the second amidification step with benzylamine and aniline did not lead to the desired compounds 3 or 4 (Scheme 2, step 2). LC/MS monitoring of this reaction revealed the disappearance of the starting product signal and the absence of formation of the desired products 3 or 4. A reaction optimization using LC/MS monitoring was therefore conducted by varying different parameters according to amidification protocols described in the literature (Table 1) [19]. The various attempts were not conclusive, and we never observed the expected product 3 or 4 by LC/MS monitoring. The formation of a black resin was visually observed for attempts 1, 4 and 5. It was described in the literature that the reactions on pyrrole consuming the starting\nFigure 3.

Cytotoxicity and anti-T. cruzi Biological Evaluation\nThese new derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the intracellular T. cruzi strain X10/7-Silvio by determining their 50% efficacy concentration (EC50) and were compared to the reference anti-T. cruzi drug nifurtimox. The in vitro 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) were assessed on the CHO cell line and compared to a cytotoxic reference drug, doxorubicin. In vitro cytotoxicity against vero host cells was also assessed (vero cells EC50). The results are presented in Table 4. Regarding the effect on cell viability of the CHO cells, except for one compound (3), the other derivatives showed good cytotoxicity values ranging from 155.6 to 321.1 \u00b5M compared to the reference drug, doxorubicin (CC50 CHO = 4.6 \u00b5M). Three compounds showed no cytotoxicity against vero host cells at concentrations up to 50 \u00b5M (17\u201319). Of the 10 synthesized molecules, three showed poor DMSO solubility, limiting their in vitro anti-T. cruzi evaluation (20\u201322). Three compounds showed T. cruzi EC50 < 10 \u00b5M (4, 16 and 18). Only compound 18 exhibited activity against the parasite (EC50 = 3.6 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5M) without toxicity against host cells at concentrations up to 50 \u00b5M. However, the maximum effect of the latter compound (Figure 4) compared to the nifurtimox control (Figure 5) was relatively low (79% and 71% in two independent replicates), indicating that a substantial number of parasites survive 96h treatment. Whether longer duration treatments may eliminate all parasites remains to be explored. The structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) can be suggested from these biological results. The presence of a benzyl group seems to be unfavourable for anti-T. cruzi activity. Indeed, compounds 3 and 15 with respectively benzyl and meta-EWG 3-CF3 benzyl group exhibit no activity against T. cruzi (EC50 = 34.5 \u00b5M and 41.0 \u00b5M), whereas their analogue with phenyl (4) and meta-EWG 3-CF3 phenyl group (18) exhibits activity (EC50 < 10 \u00b5M). The meta-EWG 3-CF3 phenyl group gave the best anti-T. cruzi activity (18), while the metaelectro-donating OCH3 phenyl group (19) gave the lowest anti-T. cruzi activity (EC50 = 50.0 \u00b5M).

Indeed, compounds 3 and 15 with respectively benzyl and meta-EWG 3-CF3 benzyl group exh bit no activity against T. cruzi (EC50 = 34.5 \u00b5M and 41.0 \u00b5M), wh reas their analogue with phenyl (4) and meta-EWG 3-CF3 phenyl group (18) exhibits activity (EC50 < 10 \u00b5M). The meta-EWG 3-CF3 phenyl group gave the best anti-T. cruzi activity (18), whil the meta-electro-donating OCH3 phenyl group (19) gave the lowest anti-T. cruzi activity (EC50 = 50.0 \u00b5M). An electron-withdrawing (EWG) group in the meta-position of t phenyl seems to be important for anti-T. cruz activity.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2163 7 of 17\nFigure 4.

            "text": "The toxicity of compounds towards Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1, ATCC CCL61) was evaluated by the NRU toxicity test, based on the concentration-dependent reduction of the uptake of the vital dye neutral red when measured 24 h after chemical treatment. Cells were grown in McCoy\u2019s medium supplemented with Penicillin 100 IU/mL\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2163 14 of 17\nand streptomycin 100 \u00b5g/mL, and 10% of inactivated calf serum, and incubated at 37 \u25e6C in CO2 5% atmosphere. They were seeded into two 96-well tissue culture plates (0.1 mL per well), at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL, and incubated at 37 \u25e6C (5% CO2) for 24 h, until confluent. The culture medium was decanted and replaced by 100 \u00b5L of fresh medium containing the appropriate concentrations of the compounds (eight different concentrations in triplicate), then cells were incubated at 37 \u25e6C (5% CO2) in the dark for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed, placed into neutral red medium (50 \u00b5g/mL neutral red in complete medium). This vital dye is a weak cationic dye that penetrates membranes of living cells by non-diffusion and accumulates intracellularly in lysosomes. On the contrary, alterations of the cell surface or metabolism result in a decreased uptake and binding of NR in non-viable cells. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37\u25e6C, 5% CO2, and then the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with 0.2 mL of PBS to remove excessive dye. Destaining solution (50% ethanol, 1% acetic acid, 49% distilled water; 50\u00b5L per well) was added into the wells, and the plates were shaken for 15\u201320 min at room temperature in the dark. The degree of cell viability was measured by a fluorescence\u2013luminescence reader. The optical density (OD) of each well was read at 540 nm. The results obtained for wells treated with the test compounds were compared to those of untreated control wells (100% viability) and converted to percentage values. The mean OD value of blank wells (containing only neutral red desorbed solution) was subtracted from the mean OD value of three treated wells (dilutions of the test material, positive control or HBSS). The percentages of cell viability were calculated as:\nViability (%) = (Mean OD of test wells-mean OD of blanks) \u00d7 100 / (Mean OD of negative control \u2212 mean OD of blanks)\nThe concentration of the test substances causing a 50% release of neutral red as compared to the control culture was calculated by non-linear regression analysis using software Phototox Version 2.0."

T. cruzi parasites (Silvio X10/7 A1), a clonal line kindly provided by Susan Wyllie and Prof. Alan Fairlamb were maintained in Vero cells. On a weekly basis, emerged trypomastigotes were used to infect a new Vero monolayer at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1.5 [32]. For the primary intracellular assay, the infection conditions were chosen so that no trypomastigote egress occurs during the compound incubation time. First, Vero cells were infected overnight with tissue culture-derived T. cruzi trypomastigotes in T225 tissue culture flasks (MOI 5). Next, any remaining free trypomastigotes were washed away with serum-free MEM, and the infected Vero cells were harvested by trypsinisation. The infected Vero cells were then plated into 384-well plates containing the compounds to be tested, at 4000 cells per well in MEM media with 1% FCS. After 96h incubation at 37 \u25e6C in the presence of 5% CO2, the plates were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and stained with 5\u00b5g/mL Hoechst 33342. The plates were imaged on a Perkin Elmer Operetta high-content imaging system using a 20\u00d7 objective. Images were analysed using the Columbus system (Perkin Elmer). The algorithm for the primary assay first identified the Vero nuclei followed by the demarcation of the cytoplasm and identification of intracellular amastigotes. This algorithm reported the mean number of parasites per Vero cell and the total number of Vero cells. The data analysis was as previously described [33].\nThe robust z-factor was calculated with the following formula:\n1 \u2212 (3 \u00d7 (1.4826 \u00d7 MAD[0% inhibition (raw data)])) + (3 \u00d7 (1.4826 \u00d7 MAD[100% inhibition (raw data)])) MEDIAN [0% inhibition (raw data)]\u2212 MEDIAN [100% inhibition (raw data)]\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2163 15 of 17\nwith MAD = Mean Absolute Deviation. Hits from the primary screen were selected based on the following criteria: T. cruzi activity (percent inhibition) > (median T. cruzi percent inhibition + 3 \u00d7 robust Standard Deviation) and Vero activity (percent inhibition) < (median percent Vero inhibition + 3 \u00d7 robust Standard Deviation)."

The convergent synthesis methodology allowed us to introduce in 1-position of the 2-nitropyrrole an acetamide side-chain close to that found in benznidazole by overcoming the pyrrole polymerization problem. The cytotoxicity evaluation on CHO cells showed no significant cytotoxicity, except for compound 3 (CC50 < 30 \u00b5M). Compound 18 appeared to show that activity against T. cruzi intracellular amastigotes forms (EC50 = 3.6 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5M) and good selectivity over the Vero host cells. Unfortunately, this compound 18 showed an insufficient maximum effect compared to the reference drug (nifurtimox) to ensure the further development of antichagasic compounds.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information is available online at https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/molecules27072163/s1: 1H- for intermediates compounds 5\u201313; 1H and 13CNMR for compounds 2\u20134 and 14\u201322; dose-response curve data for EC50 and CC50 calculations of compounds 3, 4, 15, 16, 17 and 19.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, F.M. and P.V.; methodology, F.M., Y.K. and D.B.; formal analysis, F.M., Y.K., D.B., C.D.G.; investigation, F.M., Y.K., D.B., C.D.G.; resources, P.V., C.D.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.M., Y.K., D.B., C.D.G., P.V.; writing\u2014review and editing, F.M., Y.K., D.B., N.P., C.D.G., P.V.; visualisation, F.M., Y.K., D.B., N.P., C.D.G., P.V.; supervision, P.V.; project administration, F.M., P.V.
