    "abstractText": "Observations have shown that seeds collected by harvester ants are less likely to mold. Based on evolutionary analysis and other research, it was hypothesized that harvester ants could apply actinomycetes to protect seeds, similar to the protection of mutualistic fungi by leafcutter ants. Two actinomycetes were successfully isolated from the harvester ant Messor orientalis. The taxonomic status of the actinomycetes was determined by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and biochemical experimental observations. Their inhibitory effects on plant pathogens were measured. One of the bacteria was identified as Brachybacterium phenoliresistens and denoted as B. phenoliresistens MO. The other belonged to the genus Microbacterium. It was named Microbacterium sp. Growth rate determination and coculture experiments were performed to explore the inhibitory effect of actinomycetes on indicator plant pathogens. The inhibition rates of the actinomycetes toward Peronophythora litchii and Rhizoctonia solani were 100% in media containing 30% or more fermentation broth, and they also showed an inhibitory effect on Colletotrichum siamense. The coculture experiment supported this result by showing that the growth of P. litchii and R. solani was inhibited in the presence of actinomycetes. Therefore, the results of this study show the agricultural application potential of these bacteria and may provide a reference for research on the symbiosis of harvester ants with actinomycetes.",

            "text": "Symbiotic microbes exist in a vast majority of insects [1], with actinomycetes accounting for a large proportion of the microbes found in insects [2]. Actinomycetes can help insects adapt to their habitats and resist natural enemies, and they even play a dominant role in the food digestion process [3\u20135]. Various metabolites of symbiotic actinomycetes derived from insects have shown bacteriostatic activity. Lu et al. isolated a wide range of metabolites from the actinomycete Streptomyces violaceoruber BYC-01, which showed\nInsects 2022, 13, 691. https://doi.org/10.3390/insects13080691 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/insects\nInsects 2022, 13, 691 2 of 11\ninhibitory effects on fungi obtained from termite nests. A single compound, fogacin, was extracted from the fermentation broth of this strain via distillation and ethyl acetate extraction [6\u20138]. Insect-derived Streptomyces species exhibit high inhibitory activity [9]. Streptomyces species symbiotically associated with Dendroctonus frontalis produce the secondary metabolites frontalamides and mycangimycin [9\u201311]. Mycangimycin inhibits the beetle\u2019s antagonistic fungus Ophiostoma minus, while frontalamides have general antifungal activity [9\u201311]. Sceliphrolactam, an antifungal compound isolated from Streptomyces, was found to be associated with a mud dauber wasp [9,12]. These results are promising, and there is a wide variety of insects in the world, so research on insect-associated microorganisms has high application potential, and several abundant sources of active metabolites have yet to be explored. Ants play an indispensable regulatory role in the ecosystem [13]. Studies have shown that leafcutter ants place parasitic fungal spores near symbiotic actinomycetes, e.g., Nocardiopsis, until these spores lose their infectivity [14]. The coexistence of Streptomyces sp. with strong bacteriostatic properties has been reported in invasive fire ants (Solenopsis invicta Buren) [15]. These studies showed that actinomycetes in insects may provide abundant resources for the development of antimicrobial agents. These symbioses are best exemplified in fungus-growing ants [5,8,16], carpenter ant [17\u201319], solitary digger wasps [12], and southern pine beetles [11]. A study by Tarsa et al. revealed a negative correlation between the occurrence of seed-collecting ants and that of plant pathogens [20]. Harvester ants, i.e., Messor Forel, collect and store plant seeds in their nests, which may affect microbial composition [21]. Observations in the animal room have shown that the seeds stored by harvester ants are less likely to mold, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Based on analyses from previous studies, actinomycetes in harvester ants may play an important role in this phenomenon. According to Kang, 10\u201315% of agricultural production in the world is lost due to improper storage and diseases, among other reasons [22], and 70\u201380% of the total loss is attributed to plant pathogenic fungi. Thus, to mitigate the loss of grain to plant pathogenic fungi, effective fungicides must be developed. The recent development of fungicides involves the use of plant extracts and the isolation of new compounds from microbial metabolites [23]. Actinomycetes are highly applicable in biological control because their metabolites possess strong bacteriostatic properties [24,25]. In this study, actinomycetes were isolated from Messor orientalis, and two actinomycete species belonging to the genera Microbacterium and Brachybacterium were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of symbiotic actinomycetes against fungi such as Colletotrichum siamense was assayed. The results obtained in this work may provide a scientific reference for the development of new fungicides and aid future research on seed protection mechanisms."

Inhibitory Activity of Actinomycete Colonies\nOn the bacterial plate, the growth of the pathogen was almost unaffected by live B. phenoliresistens MO and Microbacterium sp., which was consistent with the results obtained from the fermentation broth inhibition experiment. P. litchii growth was significantly inhibited by strains A and B. Mycelial growth around live strain B was relatively unaffected, while germination could not occur around live strain A, as shown in Figure 6.\nInsects 2022, 13, 691 8 of 11\nInsects 2022, 13, 691 8 of 11\n3.2.2. Inhibitory Activity of Actinomycete Colonies On the bacterial plate, the growth of the pathogen was almost unaffected by live B. phenoliresistens MO and Microbacterium sp., which was consistent with the results obtained from the fermentation broth inhibition experiment. P. litchii growth was significantly inhibited by strains A and B. Mycelial growth around live strain B was relatively unaffected, while germination could not occur around live strain A, as shown in Figure 6.\nTwo actinomycete strains were isolated from the harvester ants. Based on the 16S rRNA and substrate utilization analysis, strain A belongs to the Brachybacterium genus, and it is very likely that B. phenoliresistens. Hence, strain A is denoted B. phenoliresistens MO. Strain B belongs to the Microbacterium genus. Because there were differences in the substrate utilization results, strain B must be further classified. It is denoted here as Microbacterium sp. The inhibitory effects of the 2 actinomycetes on plant pathogenic fungi were assayed. When the actinomycete fermentation broth concentration was higher than 30%, the inhibition rates on the indicator fungi, i.e., P. litchii and R. solani, were significantly high, wherein a 100% inhibition rate was recorded. The inhibitory effects of these two actinomycetes on C. siamense were also notable, indicating prospects for agricultural applications. Through coculturing live bacteria, we obtained results consistent with a previous conclusion, showing that the two strains exhibited strong inhibitory effects on P. litchii and R. solani.\n5. Discussion Rice sheath blight caused by R. solani is one of the three major rice diseases and is the major disease in rice-producing areas in Asia. As a result, the damage caused by R. solani has led to significant agricultural losses in China each year [26]. In addition, infestation by P. litchii in litchi during storage and transport can result in great losses each year [27]. In this work, two strains of actinomycetes were used on these two types of plant pathogenic fungi at certain concentrations, and an inhibition rate of 100% was observed; therefore, the inhibitory effect of the live bacterial cultures on the pathogenic fungi was confirmed. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. This result is possibly related to the bacterial fermentation products. In general, the inhibitory rates exhibited by the actinomycetes on P. litchii were higher than those of the other two pathogenic fungi, which suggests that P. litchi is more sensitive to actinomycetes [15]. The 100% pathogenic fungus inhibition rate may indicate the potential agricultural applications of these actinomycetes for multiple crops. Multiple methods\u2014HPLC, metabolomic profiling, and gas chromatography\u2014can be used to study the chemical characteristics, including toxicity, light degradability, and stability, of antifungal metabolites to determine whether actinomycetes can be used as fungicides against R. solani and P. litchii. As such, this work indicates a potential means of reducing the economic loss caused by damage to rice and litchi by R. solani and P. litchii.\no actino t st i i ased on t e 6S r and substrate util zation analysi , train A belongs to the Brachybacterium genus, and it is very likely that B. phenoliresistens.

Microbacterium is an abundant component of bacterial communities in the soil, insects, and leaf material of plants [8]. In previous studies, M. testaceum KU313 isolated from stored rice grains was antagonistic to Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium spp. [28]. Microbacterium sp. LGMB471 isolated from the medicinal plant Vochysia divergens inhibited the development of Phyllosticta citricarpa [29]. Microbacterium sp. isolated from tomato plants inhibited the growth of Alternaria alternata, Corynespora cassiicola, and Stemphylium lycopersici [30]. Among these, antifungal compounds, 5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-indole produced by strain KU143, 7-O-\u03b2-D-glucosyl-genistein and 7-O-\u03b2-D-glucosyl-daidzein produced by strain LGMB471, were also discovered [28,29]. Brachybacterium exists in various environments, such as soil (poultry deep litter, contaminated sand), roots, fermented food, and animals [31]. It was reported that B. paraconglomeratum YEBPT2 isolated from banana contributed to antifungal\nInsects 2022, 13, 691 9 of 11\nactivity against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc), and nine bioactive metabolites were identified as diethyl hydrazine, carbonic acid, nitrosopyrrolidine, 4H-pyran, valeric acid, butanoic acid, trioxsalen, deoxy-d-mannoic acid, and amino caprylic acid [32]. Ants are one of the most successful terrestrial species [33]. Many researchers devoted to screening the high biotechnological potential of ant-associated microorganisms, as well as the significant ecological impact of microbial secondary metabolites [5,8,9,13\u201318,34\u201336]. Nonetheless, most studies have mainly focused on ant\u2013fungus\u2013actinomycete tripartite mutualism evolved by leaf-cutting ants, which use antifungal microbial secondary metabolites produced by actinobacteria (Streptomyces spp., Nocardia spp., Pseudonocardia spp., Amycolatopsis spp., etc.) to control pathogens in their fungal gardens [5,9,16,35\u201339]. The rich diversity of antimicrobial secondary metabolites plays a driving role in shaping the ecosystems of leaf-cutting ants. Only by revealing the chemical nature of antibiotics can we begin to fully understand the complex interactions between multi-organismic partners. In this work, B. phenoliresistens MO. and Microbacterium sp. exhibited pronounced antifungal properties; however, the possible symbiotic relationship between harvester ants and actinomycetes remains unclear. The genera Microbacterium isolated from gardens and starter cultures of Atta could play disease-suppressing or other unknown roles [8], while no specific function was shown for Brachybacterium isolated from the abdomen of Leucocoprinus gongylophorus [40]. To better understand the ecological role of microorganisms associated with Messor orientalis, it is crucial to analyze the chemical composition and evaluate the biological activity of their metabolites. In further work in this area, we wish to identify more species of functional actinomycetes from Messor orientalis by using diverse isolation methods and media. In addition, we will further examine the relationship between harvester ants and actinomycetes to understand whether the ants and microbes have a mutually beneficial relationship.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Figure S1: Growth of Colletotrichum siamense on various inhibitory media.
