Group 1 (normal control) received olive oil and normal saline. Group 2 (BPH untreated group) received 3 mg/kg of testosterone propionate (TP) and normal saline, and group 3 (positive control) received 3 mg/kg of TP and 5 mg/kg of finasteride. Treatment groups 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 received 3 mg/kg of TP and a middle dose (200 mg/kg) of LD50 of ethanol crude tuber extract of C. esculenta (ECTECE) or hexane, dichloromethane, butanone, ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions of ECTECE respectively for a period of 28 days.\nResults The negative controls showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in mean relative prostate weight (approximately 5 times) as well as a reduction in relative testes weight (approximately 1.4 times less). There was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in the mean relative weights of most vital organs: liver, kidneys, and heart. This was also observed in hematological parameters: RBC, hemoglobin, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and platelets counts. In general, we note that the effects of the well-established drug finasteride on the biochemical parameters and histology of selected organs are comparable to those of C. esculenta fractions.\nConclusion This study demonstrates that C. esculenta tuber extracts provide potentially safe nutraceutical if applied in the management of benign prostate hyperplasia based on a rat model.\nKeywords Neutraceutical, Benign prostate cancer, Coco yam\nresult into BPH associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [2, 8, 12, 13]. In Uganda, the prevalence rates for LUTS in men above 55 years of age were estimated to be as high as 40.5% in a study published in 2018 [14]. Apart from the cost [10, 15] and health systems challenges, poor treatment outcomes in BPH have been linked to real and perceived side effects of commonly used pharmacological regimens [15\u201318].\nConventional pharmacological management of BPH usually involves use of alpha-blockers comprising alphaadrenoceptor antagonists, or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor or a combination of both [15, 17, 19]. These treatment options are associated with severe side effects including but not limited to organ toxicity and sexual dysfunction [20\u201322]. Moreover most of these patients are older adults with multiple co-morbidities and medications [23]. There is an urgent need for additional research into novel approaches to treatment of BPH which could involve incorporation of alternative or complementary therapies [8].\nThere are vast quantities of unexplored novel phytotherapeutic agents from commonly consumed foods that could provide better options for management and/ or prevention of BPH [24, 25]. Such options are usually\nassociated with fewer side effects due to long history of traditional use as foods [24] although more data is required to get a better understanding of their safety profiles [26]. C. esculenta (English name cocoyam or Taro, local name in Buganda region of Uganda, \u2018Obukopa\u2019 and in Igbo (Onitsha) Nigeria is among the neglected but important foods across the African continent [27\u201329] traditionally used in the management of BPH especially in West African countries [29\u201331]. Medicinal properties of C. esculenta in-vitro and in-vivo have previously been reviewed by Prajapati et al. (2011) [29]. Moreover, studies by Brown et al. (2005) suggest that C.esculenta has novel tumor specific anti-cancer activities on rat YYT colon cancer cell line [32]. Furthermore, using animal models, Kalariya et al.(2015) [33] reported that (25 and 50\u00a0 mg/ kg, i.p.) of hydroalcoholic extract of leaves of C. esculenta decreases obsessive-compulsive disorder in mice. Some studies have also demonstrated the anti-diabetic properties of C.esculenta tuber and leaves in rat model [34\u201337].\nPrevious studies by Eleazu and others [38] based on a rat animal model demonstrated that C. esculenta contains anti-inflammatory agents that may remediate BPH associated inflammation. Studies by Nzebang et al.(2018) [39] suggest that the aqueous extract from C. esculenta leaves infected by Phytophthora colocsiae would be no major health risk with estimated LD50 of more than 4000\u00a0mg/ kg in rats Although our previous studies have demonstrated that the ethanol crude extract of C. esculenta has the capacity to reduce prostate weight, total protein as well as serum concentration of prostate specific antigen [40] there was need to further explore the safety profile and associated biochemical mechanisms. This study was therefore designed to investigate the safety profile of C. esculenta in crude and semi purified form for the management and / or prevention of BPH."

Although the mean relative prostate weight (weight of each prostate divided by body weight of\nthe animal) significantly (P < 0.05) increased by approximately 5 times (Fig.\u00a02A) on treatment with testosterone propionate, this increase was moderated by C.esculenta extracts to levels comparable to that achieved by finasteride treatment.\nThe effect of ethanol crude Tuber extract of c. esculenta and Fractions on the weights of vital organs Administration of TP in male Wistar albino rats showed no significant (p > 0.05) difference on the relative liver, kidneys and heart weights although there was a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in mean relative testes weight by approximately 1.4 times less (Fig.\u00a03(a-d)).

            "text": "This study was aimed at investigating the safety profile of C. esculenta in crude and semi purified form for the management and or prevention of BPH. Our results show that C esculenta is effective and widely tolerated as an anti BPH nutraceutical in the rat model. Although the exact natural products in C. esculenta that could explain its pharmacological actions have not been completely characterised, the methanol/chloroform extract has been reported to contain many bioactive compounds: hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, octadecanoic acid, 9,12-octadecadienoyl chloride, 11-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, 9-octadecenoic acid, 3-hexadecyloxycarbonyl-5-(2hydroxylethyl)-4-methylimidazolium, hexanedioic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl)ester and 3,5-di-t-butyl phenol. This is in addition to the high phenolic compounds content composed of Gallic Acid, Quercetin and Catechin [43, 44]. Many of these compounds have antioxidant (phenolic compounds), anti-inflammatory, anti-alopecic, 5-\u03b1-reductase inhibitory, anemiagenic, anti-tumor, immuno-stimulatory, anti-leucotriene-D4, anti-androgenic, lipoxygenase inhibitory and hypocholesterolemic properties ( organic compounds such as 9-octadecenoic acid ) [40].\nData from the biochemical and hematological parameters of our study do not show evidence of toxicity. However, we observed decrease in body weights of the treatment group. This is suggestive of a potential cellular response to arrest BPH through breakdown of tissue proteins [40]. In addition, we observed, an increase in the body weights of the groups that received finasteride, or ethanol crude tuber extract of C. esculenta (ECTECE) or hexane, dichloromethane, butanone, ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions of ECTECE which suggest bioactivity by the crude extract and fractions of ECTECE in halting the breakdown of tissue proteins.\nMore to this the elevated prostate weights as observed in the BPH untreated group could have resulted from pathological alterations in the prostatic tissue linked to BPH [40, 45]. However, the lower relative prostate weights of the BPH + finasteride, BPH + ECTECE, or BPH + hexane, dichloromethane, butanone, ethyl acetate\nand aqueous fractions of ECTECE groups indicate that these treatments may be able to reduce prostatic hyperplasia at the lower doses utilized in this investigation. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that increase in body weights of some rats contributed to the decrease in relative prostate weights, given that their bodyweights were much higher than those of the BPH untreated group.\nAccording to the present study, non-significant (p > 0.05) differences in relative liver, kidney and heart weights were observed in both BPH untreated group and the treated groups. This non-significant difference in the relative\u2019s organs weight may demonstrate nontoxic effect of the crude extract of cocoyam and fractions to the organs [46, 47]. This particular result confirms a previous report by Eleazu et al. (2013) [46] which showed no significant differences (\ud835\udc43 > 0.05) in the liver, kidney and heart weights of the diabetic rats administered cocoyam feed and diabetic control rats. Eleazu et al. (2014) [36] which reported that the diabetic rats fed with cocoyam had significant elevation (P < 0.05) of hepatic AST, ALT, ALP and serum proteins and albumin, but had significant reduction (P < 0.05) of blood glucose, serum urea, creatinine, amylase, lipase, AST, ALT and ALP compared with the diabetic control rats also support the safety of cocoyam in the management of diseases.\nReduction in the testes weight in the BPH untreated group as observed in this study could be as a result of exogenous effect of TP as a potential male contraceptive [48]. On the contrary the study revealed that crude extract cocoyam tuber and fractions were able to modulate the negative effect on the testes weight.\nIncreased counts of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and reduction in white blood cell, monocytes and lymphocytes counts; no significant (p > 0.05) difference on RBC, haemoglobin, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC and platelets counts could be attributed to the BPH induction in BPH untreated group. The treatment with crude extract of cocoyam tuber and fractions modulated the immune and haematological parameters showing the safety of the cocoyam extract and fractions. This result is similar with Princewill-Ogbonna et al. (2016) [49] which reported non-significant difference in haematological parameters in rats feed with cocoyam made feed. Azubuike et al. (2018) [47] also reported the safety of usage of C. esculenta leaves in the reduction of fat adipose tissues and its ameliorative effect on HFD-induced liver damage."
