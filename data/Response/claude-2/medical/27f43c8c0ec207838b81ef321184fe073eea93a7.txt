 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Optimize the ex vivo perfusion bioreactor system for preserving harvested periosteum flaps. Key parameters to explore include flow rate, pressure, oxygenation, and culture medium formulation. This could enable longer preservation and expand the clinical utility of periosteal grafts.

2. Develop novel tough and mechanically strong hydrogels as materials for engineered periostea. Explore different compositions and crosslinking methods to achieve mechanical properties that mimic natural periosteum.

3. Optimize 3D bioprinting techniques to manufacture multi-layered periosteum mimics with complex microarchitecture. Explore different bioinks and printing parameters. 

4. Investigate co-culture of osteogenic and endothelial cells within engineered periostea to promote vascularization. Study the crosstalk between the two cell types to enhance bone regeneration.

5. Conduct preclinical animal studies to evaluate engineered periostea in critical sized bone defects. Assess integration with host tissue, bone regeneration, and mechanical performance over time. This could demonstrate feasibility for human translation.
