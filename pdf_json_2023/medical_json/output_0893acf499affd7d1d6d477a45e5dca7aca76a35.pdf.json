    "abstractText": "Background: YF-VAX\u00ae (Sanofi, Swiftwater, PA), a live, attenuated vaccine based on the yellow fever (YF) substrain 17D-204, is the only YF vaccine licensed in the USA. Manufacturing disruption of YF-VAX and anticipated depletion of the US supply by mid-2017 led to the importation of another YF vaccine, STAMARIL\u00ae (Sanofi, France), into the USA under an expanded access investigational new drug program (EAP) to fulfil the public health need for YF vaccination. As part of this program, Sanofi collected enhanced safety surveillance data following vaccination with STAMARIL. Here, we report the results of the enhanced safety surveillance. Methods: STAMARIL vaccine was offered to those aged \u22659 months at high risk of YF. Vaccine recipients (or parents/guardians) were instructed to report suspected adverse reactions, any serious adverse events (SAEs) including adverse events of special interest [AESI] occurring after vaccination regardless of suspected relationship, and any inadvertent exposure in pregnancy or breastfeeding within 14 days of vaccination. The AESIs monitored were anaphylaxis, neurotropic disease (YEL-AND) and viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). Results: Overall, 627 079 individuals received STAMARIL from May 2017 through June 2021; of these, 1308 (0.2%) reported at least one AE, of which 122 reported at least one SAE. There were seven cases of YEL-AND and three cases of YEL-AVD reported, for reporting rates of 1.1 and 0.5 per 100 000 vaccine recipients, respectively. One vaccine recipient developed an anaphylactic reaction (reporting rate: 0.16 per 100 000). No safety concerns were identified from inadvertent vaccine exposure during pregnancy (41 pregnant women) or potential neonatal exposure via breast milk (four exposed infants). Conclusions: This study supports the utility of STAMARIL in the EAP as an alternative solution for the YF vaccine shortage in the USA. SAEs were very rare and consistent with the known safety profile of STAMARIL.",

The overall safety profile has been demonstrated through case studies, clinical reports and post-marketing surveillance.1,4,8 YF17D vaccines are considered among the safest and most efficacious vaccines available.9 Generally, one dose is considered sufficient to provide long-lasting immunity for most people,10,11 and adverse events (AE) following vaccination are usually mild and typically include headache, myalgia and injection site reactions.12 As with all YF vaccines currently available, including YFVAX, very rare but serious adverse reactions have been reported following vaccination with STAMARIL. Serious adverse reactions following YF vaccination typically manifest as one of three distinct events: anaphylaxis, YF vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (YEL-AND) and YF vaccine-associated acute viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD).13\nAs part of the STAMARIL EAP, Sanofi collected safety data following vaccination through stimulated reporting (enhanced passive safety surveillance). Here, we report the results of the safety surveillance conducted."

Before STAMARIL administration, inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed, written informed consent was obtained and participants were advised of the benefits/risks of vaccination, early symptoms indicative of potential adverse reactions12 and how to report safety events. In addition, the sponsor offered reimbursement for all medical costs directly related to any SAEs associated with study vaccination. The EAP was planned to start from May 2017 and to continue until June 2021 when a consistent supply of YF-VAX was available in the country.\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) approvals and adherence to protocol requirements were required for site participation. Each site had a designated principal study investigator (YF vaccinecertified healthcare provider) responsible for the activities at the site, and all personnel involved in the EAP completed training on the protocol and pharmacovigilance requirements. This study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki, all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nParticipants were required to fulfil all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria in order to take part in the study. Inclusion criteria were: individuals identified as high risk for YF including researchers, laboratory workers, vaccine production\nstaff and those travelling to a YF-endemic area requiring proof of YF vaccination under International Health Regulations14; age \u22659 months on the day of vaccination; signed informed consent form (ICF) by those aged \u226518 years or by a parent/guardian for those aged \u22659 months to <18 years as well as a signed assent form for those aged 7 to <18 years indicating that STAMARIL vaccine (non-US-licensed) was being administered in place of YF-VAX. Exclusion criteria were: age <9 months; known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of STAMARIL vaccine, or to egg or chicken proteins; congenital or idiopathic immunosuppression, or acquired immunosuppression including leukaemia, lymphoma, other malignancies and receipt of immunosuppressant medications (e.g. systemic corticosteroids); receipt of alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or cytotoxic or immunomodulatory drugs; and receipt of radiation therapy or organ transplant. Other reasons for exclusion were breast-feeding (if nursing could not be discontinued for at least 14 days following vaccination); or moderate or severe febrile illness or acute illness on the day of enrolment.\nVaccination and safety data collection\nTrained personnel administered the vaccine as a single 0.5- ml subcutaneous injection. The participant\u2019s medical record was used to ensure they met the study inclusion criteria. Data recorded for each vaccine recipient included at a minimum: name, enrolment number, sex, date of birth, STAMARIL lot number, date of vaccination and anatomical location of the injection. These data were provided by each clinical site to the sponsor periodically throughout the trial, in order to accurately document the vaccine population. In agreement with the FDA\u2019s Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research, safety data collection was focused on the following events: suspected adverse reactions (ARs) (serious and non-serious), SAEs, particularly adverse events of special interest (AESIs) (see below) and vaccine use in special populations (during pregnancy or breast-feeding).\nWhile there was no active surveillance of vaccine recipients taking part in the program, they were informed on which events were reportable and instructed to report them to their clinical site as part of stimulated passive reporting (enhanced passive safety surveillance). In particular, vaccine recipients (or parents/guardians) were instructed to report suspected adverse reactions, SAEs/AESIs occurring up to 6 weeks after vaccination regardless of suspected relationship, and any inadvertent exposure during or within 30 days before pregnancy or breastfeeding within 14 days of vaccination. In pregnancy exposure cases, study staff maintained contact with the participant to obtain information about the pregnancy outcome (i.e. details about the delivery and the newborn, or about pregnancy termination) including any complications. In cases of inadvertent exposure of infants/children through breastfeeding, both mother and child were monitored for at least 30 days after vaccination. Sites had to provide vaccine recipients a phone number where a message could be left or where study staff could be reached at all times. All information concerning suspected ARs and/or SAEs/AESIs were to be reported. Once reported, the sponsor actively followed up on ARs, SAEs and AESIs to fully document the event.

Cases of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction were assessed as per Brighton Collaboration definition of anaphylaxis.16 YEL-AND and YEL-AVD were defined in line with the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention case definitions.17 YEL-AND may manifest as either encephalitis (with or without demyelination) or as a neurologic disease with peripheral nervous system involvement (e.g. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome). Any occurrence of symptoms suggestive of YEL-AND, such as prolonged fever (\u2265100.5\u25e6F [>38.1\u25e6C]) with meningeal symptoms, focal neurologic dysfunction, mental status change lasting >24 h (confusion, lethargy or personality change) or new onset of seizures were thoroughly documented. YEL-AVD manifestations resemble fulminant infection by the wild-type YF virus. Any occurrence of symptoms suggestive of YEL-AVD, such as liver disorders (jaundice, increase of liver enzymes >3 \u00d7 Upper Limit of Normal), appearance of petechiae or unexplained bleeding, evidence of rhabdomyolysis or acute kidney failure were also thoroughly documented."

The rates of AEs per age is summarized in Table 2; in general, those aged\n>60 years had a higher rate of AE reporting than the other age groups. The frequency of AEs was slightly higher in women (0.23%; 721/317694) than in men (0.19%; 574/305590), but SAEs were reported at a similar rate (0.02%). Of the SAEs reported, 85 were assessed as related to the vaccine by the study investigator or the sponsor, as were 930 AEs. The most frequently reported vaccine-related AEs and SAEs are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, available at JTM online, respectively.\nThere were seven and three cases that met the YEL-AND (Table 3) and YEL-AVD (Table 4) case definitions, respectively, for reporting rates of 1.1 and 0.5 per 100 000 vaccine recipients (Table 2). YEL-AND was mainly reported within the second week after vaccination, and YEL-AVD was mainly reported 4\u2013 7 days after vaccination. With the exception of one case of YELAND (Table 3) and one case of YEL-AVD (Table 4), respectively, all these YEL-AND and YEL-AVD events occurred in individuals aged \u226560 years (reporting rates of 6.2 and 2.1 per 100 000 vaccine recipients in this age group, respectively, Table 2). Additional risk factors included a suspicion of underlying neoplasia in one individual with YEL-AND and concomitant infection with Clostridium difficile in another with YEL-AVD. All participants who reported YEL-AND and YEL-AVD survived.\nThere were 12 neurologic events classified as \u2018Level 1 neurologic disease\u2019 as per US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) criteria (Supplementary Table S3 available at JTM online). These events included symptoms of aseptic meningitis, paraesthesia or seizure, which started between 4 and 32 days post-vaccination, but were not accompanied with symptoms/findings of Level 2 case ascertainment, required for classification as YEL-AND. In three of these cases, the cerebrospinal fluid was positive for YF IgM, which supported the causal association with the vaccine (Supplementary Table S3 available at JTM online). These events were mainly reported in young adults (10 of these events were in age group 10\u201339 years), suggesting that the severity and extent of vaccine-associated neurologic reactions may be age-related.\nThere was one case that met the Level 1 Brighton collaboration definition for anaphylaxis; a 17-year-old individual with a history of allergy to cephalosporin antibiotics who developed lip and tongue swelling, difficulty swallowing and throat tightness on the same day of vaccination. The reporting rate for anaphylaxis based on this single case was 0.16 per 100 000 vaccine recipients. Another participant (a 24-year-old woman)\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jtm /article/30/7/taad037/7097859 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\npresented with trouble swallowing and a tingling, scratchy and itchy throat 10 min post-vaccination that was classified as type I hypersensitivity, but did not meet the Brighton collaboration criteria for anaphylaxis as only one system, the respiratory tract, was involved. She also received typhoid and hepatitis A vaccines concomitantly with STAMARIL and had no personal history of allergy. Both participants recovered.\nNo safety concerns were identified from inadvertent vaccine exposure during pregnancy (41 pregnant women); Supplementary Table S4, available at JTM online, summarizes the number of cases of vaccine exposure during pregnancy by gestation period. No instances of congenital anomaly were reported from cases of vaccine exposure during pregnancy. There were five SAEs reported in women who received inadvertent exposure during pregnancy; of these, there were two cases of adverse pregnancy outcome. One case, a 33-year-old who was not aware of pregnancy at the time of vaccination (and refused a pregnancy test prior to STAMARIL vaccination), had a spontaneous early miscarriage within 4 weeks of simultaneous vaccination with STAMARIL, hepatitis A and B, meningococcal ACYW and typhoid vaccines. Both the study investigator and the sponsor separately assessed the event as not related to the study vaccine. The other case, a 42-year-old, had a spontaneous abortion at approximately 5 weeks\u2019 pregnancy, 8 days after receiving STAMARIL, hepatitis A and B vaccines. She was also using scopolamine patches for motion sickness and escitalopram for depression. The study investigator assessed the abortion as related to concomitant use of scopolamine patches and escitalopram. Of the other three SAEs, two reported hives within 7 days of vaccination with no other clinically relevant information available and one developed influenzalike symptoms (date unknown) after vaccination. The latter case delivered a healthy baby at full-term, but the pregnancy outcomes were unknown for the two cases that reported hives.\nThere were two cases of infant exposure to vaccine through breast milk reported. One case, a 9-month-old toddler with history of seborrheic dermatitis treated with topic hydrocortisone, experienced a non-serious heat rash of two-day duration three days after exposure. To note, this infant was also vaccinated with STAMARIL along with the mother. The other case, a 2-yearold, also vaccinated with STAMARIL along with the mother, was diagnosed with hand, foot, mouth disease (viral aetiology) 26 days after vaccination. Both these events were assessed as not related to the study vaccine."

            "text": "This study provides updated evidence in support of the safety of STAMARIL with no safety issues identified during the EAP.\nSAEs were very rare and consistent with the known safety profile of both STAMARIL and other YF vaccines including YF-VAX. Despite the enhanced passive safety surveillance of AEs, the overall frequency of AEs was very low with 0.21% (1308/627 079) of participants experiencing at least one AE, although reporting rates increased with age and were marginally higher in frequency in women than in men. No safety concerns were identified from inadvertent vaccine exposure during pregnancy or potential neonatal exposure via breast milk, in line with findings reported in a systematic review, which examined AEs associated with YF vaccination in pregnant women as well as other special groups.18 Of note, the occurrence of spontaneous abortions in the EAP (2/41 [4.9%] of exposed pregnancies) was below the miscarriage rate in unvaccinated pregnant women. The frequency of clinically recognized spontaneous abortion previously reported in the literature ranges from 9 to 17% for women aged 20\u201330 years, increasing sharply with maternal age to 80% at age 45 years.19 However, it is worth noting that the pregnancy outcomes were missing/not known in many cases in our study.\nThe rates of anaphylaxis (0.16 per 100 000), YEL-AND (1.1 per 100 000) and YEL-AVD (0.5 per 100 000) in the EAP were generally consistent with the rates previously reported for anaphylaxis (1.8 per 100 000), YEL-AND (0.8\u20133.04 per 100 000) and YEL-AVD (0.019 to 1.8 per 100 000) following YF vaccination.12,20\u201322 The reported rates of these events differ, in part, due to differences in study designs e.g. (passive vs active surveillance) or case definitions used. With the exception of one case of YELAND and one case of YEL-AVD, all YEL-AND and YEL-AVD cases during the EAP occurred in individuals identified as at increased risk of experiencing AEs (i.e. age \u2265 60 years). However, cases of YEL-AND and YEL-AVD have also been reported in the literature in individuals with no identified risk factors. All participants who reported YEL-AND and YEL-AVD survived and in general, those aged \u226560 years had the higher rates of SAEs including YEL-AND and YEL-AVD, consistent with other studies.8,12,13,20,23\nThe depletion of Sanofi\u2019s YF-VAX stocks also had consequences for a number of other countries, with differing strategies in place for dealing with the vaccine shortage. In Japan, unlike in the USA, there is no regulatory system in place allowing the use of unlicensed medicines. Therefore, STAMARIL in Japan was supplied using an investigator-initiated clinical trial conducted by the National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM).24,25 In that trial, there were no cases of YEL-AND, YEL-AVD or anaphylaxis reported following vaccination of 11 279 individuals, with only two cases of inadvertent vaccine exposure during pregnancy.24 This experience should help inform decisions elsewhere in case of similar critical vaccine shortages in the future.\nnloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jtm /article/30/7/taad037/7097859 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nJournal of Travel Medicine, 2023, Vol. 30, 7 5 Ta b le 3.

EAP safety data collection was based on enhanced passive safety surveillance with no active follow-up of vaccine recipients for AEs, which may still be prone to underreporting of these events. However, underreporting of SAEs may be less likely, given the informed consent process and explicit instructions provided to all vaccine recipients on the reporting of safety events, including specific information about early recognition of events potentially compatible with YEL-AND or YEL-AVD, as well as the agreement to reimburse participants for SAE\u2019s linked to STAMARIL administration. An additional limitation was the fact that not all US travel clinics were included in the STAMARIL EAP. Clinics were not randomly enrolled, but were included based on the volume of YF-VAX previously prescribed and sites were chosen in part based on their geographic location with the aim of supplying vaccines to high volume sites and ensuring vaccine availability regardless of location; therefore, the program population may not be representative of the US population as a whole.\nIn conclusion, no new safety concerns were identified and serious adverse reactions were very rare and consistent with the known safety profile of STAMARIL. Of note, no case of YF disease was reported in US travellers during the EAP. The EAP ended in June 2021 as increasing YF-VAX manufacturing capacity and resultant ample supply became available to civilian travellers resident in the USA."
