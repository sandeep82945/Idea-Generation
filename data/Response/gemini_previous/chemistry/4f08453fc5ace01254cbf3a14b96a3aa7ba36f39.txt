1. **Investigate the effects of milk-derived cell-penetrating peptides on other inflammatory pathways:** The current study focused on the effects of milk-derived peptides on the NF-κB pathway, TNFα, and IL-1β secretion. However, there are numerous other inflammatory pathways that could be modulated by these peptides. Future research could investigate the effects of milk-derived peptides on these other pathways, such as the MAP kinase pathway, the JAK-STAT pathway, and the inflammasome pathway.


2. **Explore the potential of milk-derived cell-penetrating peptides as carriers for drug delivery:** Milk-derived cell-penetrating peptides have the ability to enter cells without causing toxicity. This makes them potential candidates for use as carriers for drug delivery. Future research could investigate the ability of milk-derived peptides to deliver drugs into cells, both in vitro and in vivo.


3. **Investigate the effects of milk-derived cell-penetrating peptides on other cell types:** The current study focused on the effects of milk-derived peptides on HeLa cells and J774.2 mouse macrophage cell lines. However, these peptides may also have effects on other cell types, such as immune cells, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. Future research could investigate the effects of milk-derived peptides on a wider range of cell types.


4. **Investigate the effects of milk-derived cell-penetrating peptides in vivo:** The current study was conducted in vitro. However, it is important to investigate the effects of milk-derived peptides in vivo to determine their safety and efficacy. Future research could investigate the effects of milk-derived peptides in animal models of inflammation and other diseases.


5. **Investigate the effects of milk-derived cell-penetrating peptides on human health:** The ultimate goal of this research is to develop milk-derived peptides that can be used to improve human health. Future research could investigate the effects of milk-derived peptides on human health in clinical trials.
