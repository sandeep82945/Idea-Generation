    "abstractText": "The full potential of Fe3O4 for supercapacitor applications can be achieved by addressing challenges in colloidal fabrication of high active mass electrodes. Exceptional adsorption properties of catecholate-type 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) molecules are explored for surface modification of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to enhance their colloidal dispersion as verified by sedimentation test results and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Electrodes prepared in the presence of DHBA show nearly double capacitance at slow charging rates as compared to the control samples without the dispersant or with benzoic acid as a non-catecholate dispersant. Such electrodes with active mass of 40 mg cm\u22122 show a capacitance of 4.59 F cm\u22122 from cyclic voltammetry data at a scan rate of 2 mV s\u22121 and 4.72 F cm\u22122 from galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge data at a current density of 3 mA cm\u22122. Experimental results are corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) analysis of adsorption behaviour of DHBA and benzoic acid at the (001) surface of Fe3O4. The strongest adsorption energy (ca. \u22121.8 eV per molecule) is due to the catechol group of DHBA. DFT analysis provides understanding of the basic mechanism of DHBA adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles and opens the way for fabrication of electrodes with high capacitance.",

            "text": "Surface modification of materials using molecules from the catechol family is emerging as a new area of technological and scientific interest [1,2]. Catecholate molecules can achieve extremely strong adhesion to inorganic surfaces by utilizing a similar adsorption mechanism to that of mussel proteins when bonded to different surfaces [2\u20134]. Very fast and very strong adsorption to various inorganic substrates is a necessity for mussels to avoid damage by sea waves. This adhesion mechanism is attributed to bonding of the catechol ligands of the mussel proteins to metal atoms on material surfaces [4\u20138]. Polymer molecules were modified with catechol ligands for the fabrication of adherent polymer and composite films [4,9\u201312]. Catecholate molecules were used as charged dispersants for electrophoretic deposition of inorganic and organic materials [5,13,14]. Catecholate molecules were also utilized as particle transfer vehicles for liquid\u2013liquid extraction [15], which prevented nanoparticle agglomeration. In this technology, inorganic particles were modified with catechol ligands in the synthesis medium or at the liquid\u2013 liquid interface and transferred from the synthesis medium directly to the device processing medium [15]. Catechol molecules facilitated efficient and versatile extraction [16] of MnO2, Mn3O4, FeOOH, and ZnO for energy storage and sensor applications. The phase transfer of the particles resulted in reduced agglomeration, which allowed for improved electrolyte access to the particle surface [16] and improved device performance. Recent studies highlighted benefits of catecholate molecules for surface modification of materials for applications in dye-sensitized solar cells and photoelectrochemical sensors [17\u201319]. For dye-sensitized solar cells, a staggered gap heterojunction can occur at a\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1562. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28041562 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1562 2 of 18\ncatechol-TiO2 interface [17], which facilitates electron injection into the TiO2 semiconductor [20]. Such configurations improved dye-sensitized solar cell efficiency. Redox properties of catechol, related to oxidation of their phenolic OH groups, were used for electron transfer mediation in electrochemical biosensors [21]. Moreover, redox properties of catechol are under investigation for applications in bioelectronics [19,22], catalysis [23], and energy storage devices [24,25]. Enhanced capacitance has been seen in catechol-modified carbon cloth electrodes due to the additional contribution of electrochemical oxidation of catechol OH groups [26]. The ability of catechol to oxidize electrochemically to o-benzoquinone allows for many uses in electropolymerization [27,28]. It is known that o-benzoquinone participates in polymerization reactions, including chemical oxidative polymerization [29], electrochemical oxidative polymerization [30], and bipolar electropolymerization [27], to be used in a variety of biomedical applications including targeted drug delivery to cancer cells [31], catechol-modified polymers with antimicrobial properties [32], and structural adhesives for tissue and bone [33]. Catechol molecules can play an additional role as charge-transfer mediators [34]. The use of catecholate dopants for polypyrrole facilitated charge transfer, reduced electropolymerization potential, and allowed the fabrication of adherent polypyrrole films on non-noble substrates [35\u201337]. The functionalization of ferrimagnetic nanoparticles with catecholate molecules induced improved magnetization [38]. Other investigations reported applications of catecholate molecules for the fabrication of quantum dots and luminescent materials [39,40]. Catecholates have generated significant interest for applications in nanotechnology as capping, reducing, and structure directing additives, which facilitated the fabrication of nanoparticles of metals and metal oxides with controlled size, shape, and functional properties [41\u201345]. Further progress in the application of catecholates in nanotechnology can result in the development of advanced functional nanomaterials for modern applications. Catecholates are of particular interest for the fabrication of devices, based on materials, combining advanced magnetic and electrical properties [41,46,47]. This investigation was motivated by interesting electrical charge storage properties of iron oxides, such as Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 [41,48]. Fe3O4 is of particular interest for the development of multifunctional devices, based on the high capacitance and advanced ferrimagnetic properties of this material. It is known that Fe3O4 exhibits higher conductivity compared to many other spinel ferrimagnetic materials [49]. The relatively high conductivity of Fe3O4 is beneficial for electrochemical charge\u2013discharge processes [49]. The pseudocapacitive charging mechanism of this material, containing Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions (Fe2+Fe23+O4), is attributed to redox Fe3+ \u2194 Fe2+ reactions. The charge storage properties in the positive potential range [50,51] are attributed to oxidation of Fe2+ ions (Fe2+ \u2192 Fe3+), whereas the charging mechanism in the negative potential range is based on reduction of Fe3+ ions (Fe3+ \u2192 Fe2+) [41,52,53]. Fe3O4 is especially important for the development of negative electrodes of advanced asymmetric supercapacitors with an enlarged voltage window. Recently, significant progress was achieved in the development of different materials for positive electrodes, which showed high capacitance [54\u201356]. However, lower capacitance of the negative electrodes, such as activated carbon, is a limiting factor in the development of advanced devices. The important tasks in the development of Fe3O4 electrodes are the fabrication of small nanoparticles and prevention of their agglomeration, which can result from Van der Waals forces and magnetic attraction forces. Moreover, efficient mixing of non-agglomerated and well-dispersed nanoparticles with conductive additives is necessary for good electrode performance. Therefore, advanced capping and dispersing agents are critically important for the synthesis of small non-agglomerated Fe3O4 nanoparticles and fabrication of composite electrodes. The goal of this investigation is the fabrication of Fe3O4 electrodes for supercapacitors using a catecholate-type 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) as a capping and dispersing agent for Fe3O4 nanoparticles. This goal was achieved in experimental studies of the synthesis of Fe3O4 particles, fabrication, and testing of supercapacitor electrodes and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1562 3 of 18\napplication of density functional theory (DFT) [57] for the analysis of the DHBA adsorption mechanism. Fe3O4 has emerged as a promising supercapacitor material due to its low cost and environmentally benign nature [58]. Here, we aimed at improving electrochemical performance of fabricated Fe3O4 supercapacitor anodes and selected DHBA as a catechol molecule to play the role of a capping and dispersing agent. The chemical structure of DHBA contains adjacent phenolic OH functional groups on the 3rd and 4th carbons on the benzene ring (Figure 1), providing strong adsorption to the particle surface, while a carboxyl group can facilitate dispersion via electrostatic repulsion [59,60]. These adsorption and dispersion properties are critical to prevent agglomeration of nanoparticles in solution, particularly materials with magnetic properties, such as Fe3O4. Benzoic acid (BA) is chosen as a negative control in our experimental design. The chemical structures of DHBA and BA differ only by the adjacent phenolic OH groups present in DHBA but not in BA (Figure 1). To corroborate the understanding of the adsorption processes seen in our experimental results, we used DFT to model DHBA and BA adsorption on the surface of Fe3O4 and assess their binding affinities and mechanisms.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 18\nsynthesis of Fe3O4 particles, fabrication, and testing of supercapacitor electrodes and application of density functional theory (DFT) [57] for the analysis of the DHBA adsorption mechanism.

Fe3O4 has emerged as a promising supercapacitor material due to its low cost and environmentally benign nature [58]. Here, we aimed at i proving electrochemical performance of fabricated Fe3O4 supercapacitor anodes and selected DHBA as a catechol molecule to play the role of a capping and dispersing agent. The chemical structure of DHBA contains adjacent phenolic OH functional groups on the 3rd and 4th carbons on the benzene ring (Figure 1), providing strong adsorption to t e particle surface, while a car oxyl group can facilitate dispersion via electr static repulsion [59,60]. These adsorption and dispersion properties a e critic l to prevent agglomeration of nanoparticles in solution, particularly mate ials with magnetic properti s, such as Fe3O4. Benzoic acid (BA) is chosen as negative control in our exp rimental design The chem cal structure of DHBA nd BA differ only by the adjacent phenolic OH groups present in B but not in BA (Figure 1). To orroborate the understanding of the adsorption processes seen in our experimen al results, we used DFT to model DHBA and BA adsorption on the surface of Fe3O4 and assess their bin ing affinities and mechanisms.\nFigure 1.

The abundance of the (001) surface on Fe3O4 nanoparticles has been confirmed experimentally [74]. The Fe3O4 nanoparticle surface was modelled as a slab of (\u221a 2\u00d7 \u221a 2 )\nR45\u25e6 supercell of bulk cubic magnetite. The exact structure of (001) surface of magnetite is a delicate topic [75,76], sensitive to the chemical potential of species involved. We selected a stochiometric surface terminated with tetrahedrally coordinated Fe atoms (Fetet), which is in line with previous computational studies [77\u201379] that identified this (001) surface and its termination as the most energetically favourable. Slabs of varying thicknesses (9, 15, and 23 layers) separated from its periodic image by a 25 \u00c5 vacuum layer were constructed to test for convergence of the surface energy (Figure 7). The resulting slabs were constrained by fixing the positions of the middle three layers of atoms at their relaxed bulk positions (the region enclosed by dashed lines in Figure 7) to simulate the bulk phase of Fe3O4, while the remaining outer layers of atoms were allowed to relax during optimization to simulate the surface reconstruction. The surface energy was calculated as\n\u03b3 = Eslab \u2212 NEbulk\n2A (1)\nwhere Eslab is the total energy of the constructed surface slab, N is the equivalent number of Fe3O4 formula units in the slab, Ebulk is the total energy per formula unit of the bulk Fe3O4, and A is the area of the surface slab. The calculated surface energies were compared to the surface energy found in a prior DFT study of Fe3O4 (001) surface [79]. These results can be seen in Table 2, where surface energy and Fe-O bond length are compared.\nThe bond length converges quickly as a function of the number of layers, while the surface energy converges very slowly. Due to computational constraints, we selected the 9-layer surface to investigate the physicochemical nature of the catechol adhesion. Figure 7 shows the final 9-layer force relaxed surface of which DHBA and BA adsorption will be modelled using DFT.

DFT Analysis of DHBA and BA Adsorption at the (001) Surface Previous adsorption studies [79\u201381] of single adatoms and water molecules on the\nsurface of Fe3O4 have found favourable adsorption sites and have reported adsorption energies for the various species. Ni adatoms were found to adsorb favourably onto the (001) surface and reported an adsorption enthalpy of \u22123.21 eV [79]. This study also reported the incorporation of Ni and Ti into the subsurface by replacing Fe tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively. Incorporation energies of \u22123.39 eV for the Ni and \u22128.29 eV for the Ti were reported [79]. Gargallo-Caballero et al. [76] reported co-adatom adsorption as well as incorporation at octahedral/tetrahedral sites with energies of the order of \u20135.5 eV for the magnetite (001) surface.

            "text": "Previous adsorption studies [79\u201381] of single adatoms and water molecules on the surface of Fe3O4 have found favourable adsorption sites and have reported adsorption energies for the various species. Ni adatoms were found to adsorb favourably onto the (001) surface and reported an adsorpti n enthalpy of \u22123.21 eV [79]. This study also reported the incorporation of Ni and Ti into the subsurface by replacing Fe tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively. Incorporation energies of \u22123.39 eV for the Ni and \u22128.29 eV for the Ti were reported [79]. Gargallo-Caballero et al. [76] reported co-adatom adsorption as well as incorporation at octahedral/tetrahedral sites with en rgies of the ord r of \u20135.5 eV for the magnetite (001) surface. Additionally, adsorption enthalpies of\u22120.76 eV for H2O molecules adsorbing to surface Fetet atoms and \u22120.85 eV for single H atoms adsorbing to surface O atoms were reported [80,81]. For adsorption of DHBA onto the Fe3O4 surface, bonding to both tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Fe atoms were considered, in a manner that maintained coordination seen in the bulk crystal. Adsorption of DHBA is modelled on the (001) surface in four different configurations, seen in Figure 8. Two H atoms are cleaved from phenolic OH groups, in the case of Figure 8A,B,D, and are accommodated on surface O atoms. In the cases where the carboxyl group is responsible for adsorption (Figures 8C and 9A), only one H atom is cleaved and accommodated by Fe3O4 forming a surface OH group. Adsorption strength of molecules to the surface of Fe3O4 is evaluated by the calculation of an adsorption enthalpy (Hads), which represents the difference between the total energy (Etot) of the adsorbed and nonadsorbed states\nHads = Eadsorbedtot \u2212 Enonadsorbedtot (2)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1562 10 of 18\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 18\nconfiguration (Figure 8D) is not. Figure 8A,C,D include adsorption of DHBA to a surface Fetet atom where Figure 8B captures adsorption of DHBA to two surface octahedrally coordinated Fe atoms (Feoct). The chelating bidentate configuration is the most energetically favourable, closely followed by the bridging bidentate; the carboxyl bidentate configuration is the least favourable. These trends can be explained by examining the resulting bond angles. In the case of the chelating bidentate adsorption of DHBA via phenolic OH groups (Figure 8A), the Fetet atom is pulled away from the surface. This causes the bond angle between the surface Fetet atom and the surface O atom to change from 157.26\u00b0 to 103.79\u00b0, seen in Figure 9A, returning the bond angle to a value much closer to what occurs in the bulk crystal (109.47\u00b0). This configuration also forms a bond angle with O atoms in the DHBA molecule of 94.64\u00b0 (Figure 9B).\nAdsorption of DHBA on the (001) surface of Fe3O4 in three different configurations, (A) chelating bidentate via phenolic OH groups, (B) bridging bidentate via phenolic OH groups, (C) chelating bidentate via carboxyl group, and (D) scenario where molecule adsorbs and detaches with Fe atom. The adsorption is accompanied by the surface adsorption of H+ ions displaced from OH groups. Values on each panel represent respective adsorption energies. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 18\nIn the case where DHBA is adsorbed via carboxyl group, we again see the bond angles changing, this time to 115.45\u00b0 between the surface O and Fetet and 69.40\u00b0 between the O atoms in the carboxyl group and Fetet, shown in Figure 9C,D, respectively. This less drastic change in the bond angle towards what is seen in the bulk crystal may contribute to the less favourable adsorption energy seen when adsorption occurs via the carboxyl group. Another consideration is that less energy may be required during the cleaving/adsorption process of the H atom in one of the phenolic OH groups (Figure 8A) compared to breaking the double bonded O in the carboxyl group (Figure 8C) to bond to the Fetet atom. We see similar changes in bond angle for adsorption via carboxyl group for BA to that of adsorption via carboxyl group for DHBA, this time changing to 114.33\u00b0 in the case of Figure 9C and to 65.12\u00b0 in the case of Figure 9D. This further explains the results seen experimentally, describing the role of phenolic OH groups for adsorption onto the Fe3O4 surface. In all configurations, the DHBA adsorption restores the coordination of the metal ions involved in bonding. Two different configurations of BA on the surface of Fe3O4 can be seen in Figure 10. In the chelating bidentate configuration (Figure 10A) adsorption energy is similar to that of the chelating bidentate adsorption via carboxyl group seen with DHBA (Figure 8C). In both cases where the carboxyl group is responsible for adsorption, the adsorption energy is much less than that of the chelating bidentate adsorption via phenolic OH groups.

The Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP) (version 5.4.4, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria) [88\u201390] and projector augmented-wave potentials [91] were used, where the p semi-core states were treated as valence states for Fe potentials in all calculations. Standard potentials were used for all other elements. The cut-off energy for a plane wave expansion of 500 eV was used for the relaxation of the bulk and surface structures to achieve an accurate stress tensor, and the cut-off energy of 400 eV was used in the case of adsorption calculations. During bulk relaxation, atomic position, cell shape, and cell volume were relaxed, whereas only atomic positions were relaxed during the surface and adsorption calculations. We included on-site Coulomb interaction to treat the highly correlated Fe 3d-electrons in the framework of Dudarev et al. [92] using an effective Hubbard energy of U = 3.7 eV [79]. Collinear spin-polarized calculations were performed for all structures. Magnetic moments were initialized with opposing spin orientations of magnitude 4.0 \u00b5B for tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Fe atoms [93]. Full self-consistent structural optimization was performed for the bulk, while only forces were relaxed for surface models of Fe3O4 with additional constrains (see Section 2.2 for more details). The structure was considered as optimized when the magnitude of Hellmann\u2013Feynman forces acting on atoms dropped below 50 meV/\u00c5 and components of the stress tensor did not exceed 1 kbar. The groundstate energy was calculated using first order Methfessel\u2013Paxton smearing with a width of 0.02 eV. A blocked-Davidson algorithm with high precision is used during the relaxation of the bulk and surface Fe3O4 structures. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a \u0393-centered k-mesh generated automatically with a linear density of 15 divisions per 1 \u00c5\u22121 of the reciprocal space. Adsorption calculations utilize a preconditioned conjugate gradient with normal precision and automatic \u0393-centered k-mesh with 30 divisions per 1 \u00c5\u22121.

DHBA\u2019s exceptional adsorption and dispersing properties, utilized during synthesis of Fe3O4, contribute to the significant increase in capacitance at low values of impedance. With a mass loading of 40 mg cm\u22122, a capacitance of 4.59 F cm\u22122 was obtained from CV data at a scan rate of 2 mV s\u22121 and 4.72 F cm\u22122 from GCD data at a current density of 3 mA cm\u22122. DFT surface and adsorption study of DHBA and BA on the Fe3O4 (001) surface sheds light on the adsorption and dispersion mechanisms seen experimentally. The largest magnitudes of adsorption enthalpies, \u22121.8 and \u22121.7 eV, are seen for DHBA chelating bidentate and DHBA bridging bidentate configurations, respectively. Lower adsorption enthalpies were calculated for adsorption of DHBA and BA via bidentate bonding of the carboxyl group, where we see comparable adsorption enthalpies of \u22121.2 and \u22121.3 eV, respectively. One can therefore conclude that, due to favourable and comparable adsorption enthalpies of DHBA and BA utilizing a carboxyl functional group, the difference in dispersion and electrochemical performance seen when comparing these two molecules as dispersing\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1562 14 of 18\nagents is dependent on the means of electrostatic repulsion. We see that the more favourable adsorption configurations for DHBA are those that rely on the phenolic OH groups for adsorption, allowing the carboxyl group to facilitate electrostatic repulsion. The Fe3O4MWCNT anode obtained with the use of DHBA as a dispersing agent, showing improved electrochemical properties, is favourable in the development of advanced energy storage devices.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28041562/s1.
