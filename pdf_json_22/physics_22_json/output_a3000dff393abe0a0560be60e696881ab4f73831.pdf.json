Yet, various forms of gating mask first-passage times and differentiate them from actual detection times. For instance, imperfect conditions may intermittently gate our ability to observe a system of interest, such that exact firstpassage instances might be missed. In other cases, e.g., certain chemical reactions, direct observation of the molecules involved is virtually impossible, but the reaction event itself can be detected. However, this instance need not coincide with the first collision time since some molecular encounters are infertile and hence, gated. Motivated by the challenge posed by such real-life situations we develop a universal\u2014model free\u2014framework for the inference of first-passage times from the detection times of gated first-passage processes. In addition, when the underlying laws of motions are known, our framework also provides a way to infer physically meaningful parameters, e.g., diffusion coefficients. Finally, we show how to infer the gating rates themselves via the hitherto overlooked short-time regime of the measured detection times. The robustness of our approach and its insensitivity to underlying details are illustrated in several settings of physical relevance.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.L032043\nIntroduction. The importance of first-passage processes is recognized universally across scientific disciplines, owing to their ubiquity and wide-ranging applications [1\u20137]. How long does it take for a chemical reaction to be triggered? Or what is the time taken for an order to be executed in the stock market? These disparate examples fall under the purview of first-passage processes, where the first-passage time is now established as an indispensable tool to quantify the time taken for a given task to be completed.\nIn several practically relevant scenarios, however, the completion of a task also relies on additional constraints. For example, for a chemical reaction to be triggered, two reactants must collide. Additionally, the collision must be fertile, i.e., the reactants must be in a reactive internal state during collision. This internal state acts like a \u201cgate\u201d: a reaction can only happen when the gate is \u201copen,\u201d i.e., the molecules are in their reactive internal state. The macroscopic kinetics of these so called gated reactions has a history spanning over four decades now [8\u201320], and more recently, the study of single-particle gated reactions has gained interest [21\u201331].\nWhile the terminology of \u201cgating\u201d is unique to reaction kinetics, numerous examples fall under the wide umbrella of\n*kumar.aanjaneya@students.iiserpune.ac.in \u2020yuvalscher@mail.tau.ac.il \u2021shlomire@tauex.tau.ac.il \u00a7santh@iiserpune.ac.in\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

An important one is that of intermittently observed stochastic time series, where the underlying cause for intermittent observations can include energy costs of continuous observations, imperfect detection conditions, or simply a faulty sensor [32\u201336]. Irrespective of the reasons behind such intermittent observations, an important consequence is that key features of the time series can be missed. In particular, in the increasingly relevant field of extreme and record statistics of time series, a crucial quantity is the time taken to cross a specific threshold for the first time. However, intermittent detection of the time series can lead to a gross mischaracterization of the statistics of such events [37\u201341]. In such cases, the relevant quantity is the first detection time, which denotes the first time the time series is observed above the threshold [39].\nFigure 1 exemplifies two instances where gating arises naturally: (a) Single particle tracking of an intermittently observed particle, which transitions between a visible state and an invisible state. For example, a wide class of fluorophores undergo photoblinking [42\u201351]. Other reasons for such gating can be the intermittent loss of focus on a moving particle in three dimensions [52] or slow frame acquisition rate [53]; (b) A gated chemical reaction or target search, where tracking of the particle is not possible, and the reaction time is the only measurable quantity. Such instances may arise in cellular signaling driven by narrow escape [54,55] and among fluorescent probes [56].\nIn both examples illustrated in Fig. 1, the first-passage time statistics carry invaluable information, but are inaccessible to direct measurement. In such scenarios, a crucial challenge is to reliably infer these statistics and other fundamental properties of interest.\nIn this Letter, we address this challenge and solve it. First, we show how the first-passage time density can be inferred\n2643-1564/2023/5(3)/L032043(7) L032043-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nfrom gated observations via a model-free formalism, which upon specification of the underlying laws of motions can be further used to infer physically meaningful parameters (e.g., the diffusion coefficient). Second, using the joint knowledge of the gated (observed) and ungated (inferred) first-passage time densities, we establish that the overlooked short-time regime of the gated detection time distribution can be leveraged to obtain the gating rates.\nModeling gated processes. We start by modeling a gated process consisting of two independent components. First, an underlying process Xn0 (t ), initially at n0, modeled as a continuous-time Markov process. Second, a gate modeled by a two-state continuous-time Markov process, that intermittently switches between an \u201copen\u201d active (A) state and a \u201cclosed\u201d inactive (I) state. This gate accounts for the additional constraint that needs to be satisfied for the task of interest to be completed. The gate switches from state A to I at rate \u03b1, and from I to A at \u03b2. For \u03c30, \u03c3 \u2208 {A, I}, we define pt (\u03c3 |\u03c30) to be the probability that the gate is in state \u03c3 at time t , given that it was in state \u03c30 initially (see the SM for an explicit formula [57]). Also, let \u03c0A = \u03b2/\u03bb and \u03c0I = \u03b1/\u03bb denote the equilibrium occupancy probabilities of states A and I, respectively, where \u03bb = \u03b1 + \u03b2 is the relaxation rate to equilibrium.\nThe central quantity of interest in our Letter is the first-passage time Tf (m|n0), which is the time taken for Xn0 (t ) to reach state m for the first time, and we denote its probability density by Ft (m|n0). In many scenarios the first-passage time is not directly measurable, and instead we can only measure the detection time Td (n0, \u03c30), of a reaction or threshold\ncrossing event. We denote by Dt (n0, \u03c30) the probability density of Td (n0, \u03c30), which is the first time the underlying process is detected in some target-set Q, given that the initial state of the composite process (underlying + gate) is initially at {n0, \u03c30}.\nIn this work, we focus on two widely applicable settings: (i) the detection of threshold crossing events of a onedimensional intermittent time series with nearest-neighbor transitions, where Q denotes all states above a certain threshold m, and Td (n0, \u03c30) is the first time when Xn0 (t ) m while the detector is active (A); and (ii) gated reactions or target search on an arbitrary network in discrete space or in arbitrary dimension in continuous space. Here, Q is typically a single target state/point m, and Td (n0, \u03c30) denotes the first time the underlying process Xn0 (t ) is at m, while the gate is open (A).\nFirst-passage times from gated observations. We begin our analysis by noting that for n0 \u2208 Q we have\nDt (n0, \u03c30) = Ft (m|n0)pt (A|\u03c30)\n+ \u222b t\n0 Ft \u2032 (m|n0)pt \u2032 (I|\u03c30)Dt\u2212t \u2032 (m, I ) dt \u2032, (1)\nwhere the probability for a detection event occurring at time t has two contributions: (i) the detection time coinciding with the first-passage time; and (ii) the gate being closed during the first-passage event (I), and detection happening strictly after this moment in time. The Laplace transform of Eq. (1), can be expressed in compact form as [57]\nD\u0303s(n0, \u03c30) = [\u03c0A + \u03c0I D\u0303s(m, I )]F\u0303s(m|n0) + 1(\u03c30)(1 \u2212 \u03c0\u03c30 )[1 \u2212 D\u0303s(m, I )]F\u0303s+\u03bb(m|n0),\n(2)\nwhere \u03bb = \u03b1 + \u03b2, and 1(\u03c30) takes values +1 or \u22121 when \u03c30 = A or I , respectively. By explicitly writing down the equations for \u03c30 = A and I , and further eliminating F\u0303s+\u03bb(m|n0) from the equations, we arrive at [57]\nF\u0303s(m|n0) = \u03c0AD\u0303s(n0, A) + \u03c0I D\u0303s(n0, I ) \u03c0A + \u03c0I D\u0303s(m, I ) , (3)\nwhich is our first result. Equation (3) asserts that the firstpassage density can be obtained exactly in terms of detection time densities and the gating rates. In [57], we further show that Eq. (3) holds even when the underlying process in not Markovian, and instead is a renewal process. Yet, inference of the first-passage time density Ft (m|n0) using Eq. (3) requires the detection statistics with initial conditions {n0, A}, {n0, I}, and {m, I}, and the equilibrium probabilities \u03c0A and \u03c0I . Such information may not be accessible in experimentally realizable scenarios where, e.g., it may not be possible to initialize a gated molecule in a specific internal state \u03c30 = A or I , and the values of \u03c0A and \u03c0I may also be unknown.\nIn such situations, the most practically realizable initial condition is the equilibrium \u03c30 \u2261 E , where the gate is in the active state A with probability \u03c0A, and in the inactive state I with probability \u03c0I . Note that this initial condition is naturally achieved if the system is simply allowed to equilibrate. Interestingly, the detection time density starting from the initial condition (n0, E ) is given by Dt (n0, E ) = \u03c0A \u00b7 Dt (n0, A) + \u03c0I \u00b7 Dt (n0, I ), whose Laplace transform is the numerator\nL032043-2\nstanding on the right-hand side of Eq. (3). Further noting that the Laplace transform of Dt (m, E ) = \u03c0A \u00b7 \u03b4(t ) + \u03c0I \u00b7 Dt (m, I ) gives the denominator on the right-hand side, we obtain an elegant reinterpretation of Eq. (3):\nF\u0303s(m|n0) = D\u0303s(n0, E ) D\u0303s(m, E ) . (4)\nStrikingly, Eq. (4) asserts that the first-passage time density can be inferred from the detection statistics, even without the explicit knowledge of \u03c0A and \u03c0I , or control over the initial state of the gate.\nThe usefulness and validity of Eq. (4) is demonstrated in Fig. 2, with the help of three case studies of wide interest and applicability. First, a Markovian birth-death process which has been extensively used to model threshold activated reactions [58\u201361] and the dynamics of chemical reactions on catalysts [62,63]. Second, the paradigmatic continuous-space diffusion in a 1D confinement. Third, a gated chemical reaction/target search modeled by a non-Markovian continuous-time random walk (CTRW) [64,65] on a network [66], which is, e.g., used to model the motion of reactants, cells, or organisms in complex environments [30,66\u201372]. In all of these settings, we show that the first-passage time distributions inferred from Eq. (4) using a procedure described in [57] (circles) are in excellent agreement with the true first-passage time distributions. We stress that this inference was performed solely using detection time histograms obtained from gated simulations of 106 detection events, without assuming knowledge of the analytical expressions of their probability densities or model specific details (e.g., the network structure and the waiting time distribution in the CTRW example). We note that numerical errors start to appear in the tail region when estimating very small probabilities [57]. These errors can potentially be addressed through parametric inference methods which use domain-specific knowledge (e.g., exponential tail of first-passage time distributions in confined systems) to perform the inference. Moreover, when analytical expressions are available, like in the case of the birth-death process [39], one can directly perform the inference through Laplace inversion of Eq. (4) [57].\nBefore moving forward, we note that Eq. (4) is reminiscent of the seminal renewal formula F\u0303s(m|n0) = P\u0303s (m|n0 )P\u0303s (m|m) which relates, in Laplace space, the first-passage time density and the probability density Pt (ni|n j ) of finding the underlying process in state ni at time t , given its initial state n j [1]. Clearly, the right-hand side of this formula and that of Eq. (4) are equal. In fact, we can obtain an even more general relation\u2014 considering two different initial states n0 and n\u20320, and after some algebra, we uncover the fundamental relation [57]\nD\u0303s(n0, E ) D\u0303s(n\u20320, E ) = P\u0303s(m|n0) P\u0303s(m|n\u20320) , (5)\nasserting that the ratio of the detection time densities (in Laplace space), starting from any two initial states n0 and n\u20320, is independent of the gating rates \u03b1 and \u03b2. Note that this is true despite the fact that the detection time densities themselves depend on the gating rates. We remark that Eq. (5) holds in both settings: when Dt (n0, E ) corresponds to gated target\nsearch and to the detection of threshold crossing events under intermittent sensing.\nInferring the mean first-passage time. The Laplace transform in Eq. (4) allows us to obtain all moments of the first-passage time in terms of moments of the detection time. Equation (4) further implies that all cumulants of the first-passage time can be expressed as differences between cumulants of detection times. For example, the mean firstpassage time is given by\n\u3008Tf (m|n0)\u3009 = \u3008Td (n0, E )\u3009 \u2212 \u3008Td (m, E )\u3009. (6) While simple, Eq. (6) carries utmost importance in practical scenarios, where reliably estimating the full probability distribution is not a viable option, and only the mean can be accurately measured. Apart from setting an important time scale for a wide class of chemical reactions in confinement, where the mean reaction time can be used to infer full reaction time statistics [73], the mean first-passage time can also shed light on fundamental properties of the system at hand [74,75].\nInferring the diffusion coefficient. We now illustrate how one can utilize our framework to infer physically meaningful parameters like the diffusion coefficient D. Importantly, we show that this can be done even when the actual motion of the particle cannot be tracked. Imagine a scenario like that depicted in Fig. 1(b), namely we inject an unobservable particle\u2014whose detection is possible only upon reaction\u2014at a known location x0. Assume that the internal state of the particle is initially equilibrated (\u03c30 = E ), and further assume that it is freely diffusing inside an effectively one-dimensional box [0, L] with reflecting boundaries and a gated target located at\nL032043-3\nx0 < m < L. Utilizing Eq. (6) we find that [57]\nD = 1 2 m2 \u2212 x20 \u3008Td (x0, E )\u3009 \u2212 \u3008Td (m, E )\u3009 . (7)\nEquation (7) asserts that the diffusion coefficient can be inferred from the difference in the measurable detection times \u3008Td (x0, E )\u3009 and \u3008Td (m, E )\u3009.\nTo corroborate this finding, we simulate the aforementioned scenario and test it for a wide range of possible diffusion coefficients (Fig. 3). As implied by Eq. (6), the difference in the detection times is independent of the transition rates, the box size L, and the target size (the same equation will hold for threshold crossing). It is thus up to the experimentalist to tune these parameters such that the detection times can be measured with sufficient accuracy. Here we set \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 102 s\u22121 and L = 5 \u00b5m. For each value of D, the corresponding mean detection times were estimated from averages of N = 102 and 103 simulations, and the diffusion coefficient was inferred via Eq. (7). The error bars were estimated by repeating this procedure 102 times and noting the standard deviation. In Fig. 3 we plot the ratio between the inferred values and the actual ones. We find this estimation procedure robust, even when the number of measurements is relatively small (N = 102). For the parameters used here, the estimation is especially accurate for smaller diffusion coefficients, where mean detection times are longer.\nInferring the gating rates. Equation (4) states that the first-passage time density can be inferred from its gated counterparts, even without any prior knowledge of the gating rates \u03b1 and \u03b2 or control over the initial internal condition. We will now illustrate how the inferred first-passage time distribution can be used together with the observed detection time distribution to infer the gating rates, thus providing insight into the dynamics of the gating process.\nTo proceed, we shift our focus to short-time asymptotics analysis which, despite several recent applications in stochastic thermodynamics [76\u201378] and chemical kinetics [79,80], has not yet been used to further our knowledge on gated processes. In the short-time limit, the dominant contribution to Dt (n0, E ) comes from trajectories where the\ndetection occurs upon first arrival. This insight translates to the limiting equation \u03c0A = limt\u21920 Dt (n0, E )/Ft (m|n0). Similarly, the short-time asymptotics of Dt (m, E ) is given by \u03c0I = \u03b2\u22121 limt\u21920 Dt (m, E ), owing to the fact that when the underlying process starts on m, the dominant contribution to detection comes from events where the gate opens before the particle leaves the target or falls below the threshold.\nThese limiting representations of the probabilities \u03c0A and \u03c0I , along with their normalization, allow us to obtain the gating rates as follows:\n\u03b1 = lim t\u21920 Dt (m, E )Ft (m|n0) Dt (n0, E ) , (8)\n\u03b2 = lim t\u21920 Dt (m, E )Ft (m|n0) Ft (m|n0) \u2212 Dt (n0, E ) . (9)\nEquations (8) and (9) are corroborated in Fig. 4 for the birth-death process with parameters described in [57]. Furthermore, in [57] we also show that these relations hold even for an arbitrary (nonequilibrium) initial condition of the gate. We then derive simpler inference relations for the gating rates, which are obtained at the cost of perfect control over \u03c30. Finally, we discuss the widely applicable case of simple diffusion and derive inference relations for \u03b1 and \u03b2, which only differ by a factor of two from Eqs. (8) and (9).\nDiscussion. Using the unified framework of gated firstpassage processes, we demonstrated how the first-passage time distribution can be inferred from gated measurements, and using these quantities, key features of the process can be extracted. The exact results obtained in this Letter can help inform statistical inference frameworks designed to deal with situations pertaining to imperfect observation conditions, including sparsely sampled time series or missing data problems. The asymptotic results presented in this Letter moreover provide a systematic approach to the inference of gating rates which, depending on the accessible timescales of the problem, can be improved upon by considering higher-order corrections to the asymptotics.\nAcknowledgments.
