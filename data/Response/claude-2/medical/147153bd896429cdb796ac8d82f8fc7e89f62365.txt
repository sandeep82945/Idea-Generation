 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the mechanisms by which biochar reduces fertilizer leaching in saline-alkali soils. The paper showed this effect occurs but more research on the specific mechanisms (e.g. adsorption, changes in soil structure) would be useful. 

2. Test different biochar application methods, such as mixing throughout the soil profile vs targeted application in the root zone. The paper applied biochar only in the middle layer but comparing application methods could optimize benefits.

3. Evaluate the long-term impacts of biochar on soil properties and crop yields. The paper examined short-term effects over 90 days but longer studies could reveal benefits over multiple growing seasons. 

4. Explore biochar effects on additional soil types beyond saline-alkali soils. The paper focused on one soil but expanding to other soil types could demonstrate broader potential.

5. Analyze biochars from different feedstock sources. The paper used a mixed wood-based biochar but biochars vary and comparing feedstocks could identify optimal sources.
