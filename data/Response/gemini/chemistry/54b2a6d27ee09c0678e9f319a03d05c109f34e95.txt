1. **Investigate the in vivo efficacy of CDFHCD against PDAC:** Evaluate the antitumor activity of CDFHCD in animal models of PDAC to determine its therapeutic potential in vivo. Assess tumor growth inhibition, survival rates, and toxicity profiles to establish the efficacy and safety of CDFHCD as a potential treatment for PDAC.


2. **Explore the molecular mechanisms underlying CDFHCD's anticancer effects:** Conduct mechanistic studies to elucidate the specific molecular pathways and targets involved in CDFHCD's antitumor activity. Investigate the modulation of signaling pathways, regulation of gene expression, and alterations in cellular processes induced by CDFHCD treatment in PDAC cells.


3. **Evaluate the potential of CDFHCD to overcome drug resistance in PDAC:** Investigate whether CDFHCD can overcome drug resistance mechanisms commonly observed in PDAC, such as efflux pumps, altered drug metabolism, and DNA repair pathways. Assess the efficacy of CDFHCD in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents to determine its potential for enhancing treatment outcomes in resistant PDAC tumors.


4. **Investigate the role of CDFHCD in targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs) in PDAC:** Explore the effects of CDFHCD on CSCs, which are known to contribute to tumor initiation, progression, and recurrence in PDAC. Determine whether CDFHCD can inhibit CSC self-renewal, proliferation, and migration, and evaluate its impact on CSC-mediated tumorigenicity and metastasis.


5. **Develop targeted delivery systems for CDFHCD to enhance its therapeutic efficacy:** Design and evaluate targeted delivery systems, such as nanoparticles or antibody-drug conjugates, to specifically deliver CDFHCD to PDAC tumors. Investigate strategies to improve tumor accumulation, penetration, and intracellular uptake of CDFHCD to enhance its antitumor activity and reduce systemic toxicity.
