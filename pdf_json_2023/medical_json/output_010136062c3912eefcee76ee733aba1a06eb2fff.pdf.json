Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) is a recommended approach for managing childhood illnesses, including pneumonia, in low-resource settings [6]. However, the use of pulse oximeters (PO) to measure oxygen saturation in suspected pneumonia cases has not yet been included in IMCI services in India [5,7,8]. Hypoxemia (low oxygen saturation) is a strong predictor of pneumonia mortality [9-11], and measuring oxygen saturation with PO in routine outpatient care for children in low-resource settings could help with early identification, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [12-14]. The introduction of paediatric PO could reduce neonatal and childhood mortality through the detection of hypoxemia and facilitation of timely referral [15]. However, its availability at the primary care level varies due to cost implications and a lack of perceived need by policymakers and healthcare professionals [6,16]. Implementation studies on the use of PO in primary healthcare settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India, are limited [17,18].\nPrevious studies have shown that clinical symptoms alone are insufficient for an accurate diagnosis of paediatric pneumonia and the estimation of hypoxia [19]. Manual recording of respiratory rate (RR) can be challenging and may result in the misclassification of symptoms, with chest in-drawing not being adequately recognised. Furthermore, healthcare staff often lack the necessary knowledge for the management of pneumonia [20,21]. These factors can lead to incorrect diagnoses and can impact the effectiveness of treatment [22,23]. The inclusion of paediatric PO in primary healthcare settings could significantly reduce neonatal and childhood mortality by enabling early detection of hypoxemia and timely referral [15]. Studies have demonstrated that PO can identify an additional 20% to 30% of hypoxic children compared to relying solely on clinical signs such as grunting and depressed consciousness, which can be imprecise [24,25].\nThe implementation of paediatric PO in LMICs has been limited, particularly in India, with few studies conducted in primary healthcare settings [8,12,17,26]. Therefore, there is a need for research that specifically examines the feasibility, acceptability, and operational challenges of integrating paediatric PO into IMNCI services at first-level primary healthcare facilities in rural areas of the Pune district. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and operational challenges of introducing paediatric PO in IMNCI services at first-level primary healthcare facilities in the rural Pune district, in order to improve the understanding of potential benefits and challenges associated with the use of paediatric PO in LMIC settings, specifically in India."

A primary health centre (PHC) is the first point of contact for health care for the village population; each serves 20 000-30 000 individuals and is staffed by medical officers (MOs), paramedics, and others. We selected six PHCs for the study from a list of all PHCs in the Pune district using purposive sampling; in collaboration with the district health officials from the Ambegaon and Junnar blocks, PHC staff helped the King Edward Memorial Hospital Research Centre (KEMHRC) team with implementing the study. These six PHCs together catered to a population of about 135 000 individuals with approximately 14 000 children under five years of age [27]. Four of these PHCs provide health care services to tribal communities. Based on the mandate and defined responsibilities of the PHC staff, we identified MOs and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) as study participants, as they were key service providers in the treatment of under-five children."

They could not use the PO during paediatric examinations due to insufficient equipment.\nThe ANMs also participated in IMNCI training before and requested a refresher. Their training and work experiences gave them confidence in managing paediatric patients with pneumonia, and they were well-informed about symptoms, clinical presentation, severity grades, and appropriate medical treatments for affected children.\nTheme 2: The need to reiterate the paediatric PO use and early diagnosis of pneumonia in children was emphasised\nThe ANMs had not been exposed to the paediatric PO until the interviews. They mentioned that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, they used POs for adults while screening children in the communities. However, the readings consistently showed errors. Since then, they expressed a strong desire to receive hands-on training in using paediatric PO and integrating it into their routine work in the PHCs and communities.\nBoth ANMs and MOs agreed on the importance of early pneumonia diagnosis in children to prevent complications and avoid referrals to tertiary care hospitals, considering the challenges faced by caregivers in such cases.\nTheme 3: Challenges faced by participants in the management of childhood illnesses at PHC at baseline and endline\nRegarding system-related challenges, MOs and ANMs were disturbed by the lack of paediatric POs and the use of adult equipment for children, which resulted in difficulties fitting children\u2018s fingers, battery issues, and incorrect readings. They also expressed concerns about the non-maintenance of other equipment used for treating children, such as paediatric warmers, nebulisers, and emergency kits. Paediatric patients\u2019 parents raised worries about the shortage of medicines and non-flavoured antibiotics causing vomiting in children.\nFigure 1. Conceptual framework of the study.\nAgarwal et al. PA PE R S\n2023 \u2022 Vol. 13 \u2022 04105 6 www.jogh.org \u2022 doi: 10.7189/jogh.13.04105\nThe absence of a paediatric position in the organogram significantly impacted paediatric healthcare. Thus, the MOs and ANMs recommended having a paediatric consultant visits the PHC once or twice a week, along with establishing a separate paediatric facility and maintaining a substantial stock of medicines. They believed that implementing these suggestions would lead to a significant improvement in the outpatient services for paediatric patients at the PHC.\nIn view of parents\u2019 negative attitude towards seeking health care for their children, the MO and ANM observed that they often displayed negative attitudes towards episodes of cold and cough in children, considering them routine complaints and ignoring the symptoms. They tended to experiment with home remedies and purchase over-the-counter medicines or visit local practitioners, qualified or not, before seeking help from trained clinicians if the symptoms persisted. In critical situations, when the child\u2018s health worsens, they agree with the clinician\u2018s advice for referral to a tertiary government or private facility, depending on their socio-economic status.\nHowever, many parents feared such referrals, mainly those living in cities, due to limited transportation options and the unavailability of the 108-emergency ambulance service. The expenses incurred for admission, medicines, and other miscellaneous costs exacerbated their concerns. Parents from tribal regions prefer to seek treatment at PHCs as they are financially vulnerable and rely on the free treatment provided at these centres."

They were now able to record RR and SpO\n2 of patients with cold and cough symptoms, assess the severity, and provide appro-\npriate treatment. Consequently, there was a significant increase in the number of referrals to tertiary care facilities with paediatricians for further consultation.\nThe staff expressed satisfaction with the opportunities to apply their training learnings and noticed a visible improvement in patient care. Post-training, the ANMs reported increased confidence and knowledge, leading to the utilisation of POs in community health check-up camps to screen children in villages. Most notably, they started using POs in Anganwadi centres to screen and identify high-risk children under the age of five, suspecting malnourished children to be at higher risk of pneumonia infection.\nA few MOs and ANMs were conducting training sessions for accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers in their villages, teaching them how to use the paediatric PO for screening children and making referrals to the PHCs. The ANMs have provided positive feedback about the ASHA workers\u2018 involvement, as they showed great motivation in carrying out their outreach duties. This has significantly strengthened the implementation of IMNCI. However, the actual number of patients referred is not reported due to gaps in documentation and record-keeping practices.\nTheme 2: Confidence in using the paediatric PO was boosted after the intervention\nMOs found paediatric PO to be highly useful in the early identification of high-risk children at risk of pneumonia infection. Additionally, parents\u2018 appreciation for checking SpO\n2 with the PO has significantly boosted\nthe self-confidence of the MOs and ANMs. Due to increased awareness about children\u2018s health post-pandemic, parents now expect SpO\n2 checking in every respiratory clinical examination.\nANMs gained confidence in using the paediatric PO after receiving training.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We found that knowledge and training on the identification and diagnosis of child pneumonia benefitted the healthcare staff at the PHCs significantly. They reported that it refreshed the knowledge they received in IMNCI training previously organised by the government. They became confident in using the PO and were able to reduce the errors in recordings. The proportion of PO use in examining symptomatic children increased from 26% to 85%. Crucially, after the intervention, healthcare professionals began monitoring the RR and SpO\n2 of the children, which fundamentally transformed how patients were examined before the intervention. Second, the ANM-ASHA cadre started implementing the PO in the community and also using it in the Anganwadi centres, which helped improve the screening and referral of pneumonia cases. The team reported various barriers in providing paediatric health care in PHCs and made recommendations for improvement.\nThe WHO modified its recommendations on the management of pneumonia in healthcare facilities and recommended the use of pulse oximetry, depending on availability [6]. Previously, pulse oximetry was only used for routine screening of all infants born in the early post-natal period (before release from the hospital) in various high-income countries in order to detect critical congenital cardiac disease with high specificity and moderate sensitivity [28]. However, paediatric PO use in low-income countries remains restricted because of various limitations, including the non-availability of paediatric probes, cost, poor maintenance of the devices, lack of training of staff in PO use, inadequate supervision, and others [19-22]. We showed that introducing paediatric PO to assess children for signs of pneumonia in the primary healthcare setting is feasible, with acceptance and support by the parents. The MOs and ANMs were satisfied with the paediatric PO due to its practicality, which is evident from studies conducted in Pakistan and Bangladesh [18,29]. While the Pakistan study showed that SpO\n2 measurements could be taken with a PO in less than one min-\nute and with high parental approval, indicating that it was practical in primary care settings [18], the Bangladesh study demonstrated that PO assessment was successful in 85% in first attempt and in 69% within one minute [29]. The study authors found a 92% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 91-93) adherence to standard operating procedure related to pulse oximetry, and 97% (95% CI = 96-98) agreement in identifying hypoxaemia. The median performance time was 36 seconds (interquartile range (IQR) = 20-75), which was longer among younger children (2-11 months: 44 seconds, IQR = 22-78; 12-59 months: 30 seconds, IQR = 18- 53) (P < 0.01) and among those classified as pneumonia/severe-pneumonia than as no-pneumonia (2-11 months: 41 seconds, IQR = 22-70; 12-59 months: 32 seconds, IQR = 20-62 (P < 0.01) [30]. The finding about staff \u2019s confidence to use PO and positive response by caregivers is corroborated by Bangladesh study [29].\nResearch studies have shown that using the paediatric PO has made it easier to diagnose severe pneumonia in healthcare centres as well [14,15]. In another observational study, the use of pulse oximetry helped health professionals make better decisions when referring children with severe pneumonia, which is somewhat in line the findings of our study, where we observed increased referrals after the use of PO [30]. Low compliance with referral in the study settings was mostly caused by restricted access to transportation. This sug-\nAgarwal et al.

However, our study implies that it is important that the government should consider providing pneumonia treatment at PHCs, which should be investigated in future research [30].\nA qualitative study in Bangladesh and Malawi explored the experiences of the use of paediatric PO, and found that health care professionals gained confidence through the use of the PO, gained caregivers\u2019 trust, experienced challenges while implementing it on smaller children and reported battery issues which were similar to the present study [17].\nThe observation of an overall drop in the paediatric OPD attendance at the six PHCs could be the result of COVID-19-associated restrictions. Some other reasons could be seasonal change, parents\u2018 ignorance, and reluctance to bring children to PHCs due to fear of the pandemic [31,32]. According to the ANM, upgrading the PHC with equipment to treat other paediatric illnesses could also aid in boosting OPD attendance.\nOur findings about ANM and MO recalling having previously received IMNCI training, but requesting refresher training suggests that a one-time impartment of training is not beneficial unless periodically reiterated. The pre-implementation training helped the healthcare professionals; depending on their training and experience, they may have used their clinical judgment while referring the patients. Additionally, there is a requirement for periodic training, as a few health professionals have not attended the training. The IMCI global survey report reveals that many countries are using an abridged version of the training due to costs incurred and the long absence of healthcare professionals from services. In India, it has been often highlighted that the training targets cannot be fulfilled. Regular technical assistance to the healthcare staff kept them motivated, and routine training and supervision is key for the positive incorporation of PO within primary health care. Timely action should be taken to avoid delays in the treatment and referral of children [17,18,29,30].\nThe study has several limitations. During the study, the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic reached its peak, and most public health personnel were assigned to COVID-19 management. Identification and procurement of the appropriate paediatric PO device was a challenge, necessitating significant time and effort from the KEMHRC team. Additionally, the identification of a good, calibrated PO device that is cost-effective, readily available, and sturdy to handle may pose a challenge in scaling up this implementation.\nWhile there was established periodic monitoring during the implementation process, there was no system to scientifically assess whether the providers were accurately diagnosing the conditions. Future research should include a rigorous evaluation. As interviewers were from the national health programmes, they could have expressed opinions favourable to the interviewers."

            "text": "Our findings show that paediatric PO could be integrated at the primary healthcare level successfully. The pre-implementation training and the provision of the device to PHCs were found to be helpful. The fact that paediatric PO is being used more frequently demonstrates that there is a need for the device, and that it is possible to introduce and use it in the healthcare system in a way that could assist in identifying pneumonia in children under five years. The intervention demonstrated that an algorithm including PO to diagnose pneumonia in children could improve case management. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of reducing under-five mortality will be more achieavable by enhancing case management of pneumonia at the primary care level by expanding ARI diagnostic aids, improving coverage of IMNCI, strengthening referral pathways, and improving the quality of treatment in referral facilities.\nFeasibility and acceptability of the paediatric pulse oximeter\nPA PE\nR S\nwww.jogh.org \u2022 doi: 10.7189/jogh.13.04105 9 2023 \u2022 Vol. 13 \u2022 04105\nFunding: This research was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (Global Health Research Unit on Respiratory Health (RESPIRE); 16/136/109) using UK aid from the UK Government to support global health research.
