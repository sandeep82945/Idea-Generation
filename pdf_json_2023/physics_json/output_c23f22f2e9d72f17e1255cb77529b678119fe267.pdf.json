The objective of the study was to understand 43 the modulation of the adsorption mechanisms and enzymatic activity of Guinea pig PLRP2 44 (gPLRP2), by the physical environment of the enzyme and the physical state of its substrate. 45 Langmuir monolayers were used to reproduce homogeneous and heterogeneous photosynthetic 46 model membranes containing galactolipids (GL), and/or phospholipids (PL), and/or phytosterols 47 (pS), presenting uncharged or charged interfaces. The same lipid mixtures were also used to form 48 micrometric liposomes, and their gPLRP2 catalyzed digestion kinetics were investigated in 49 presence or in absence of bile salts (NaTDC) during static in vitro, so called \u201cbulk\u201d, digestion. 50\nThe enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 onto the galactolipid-based monolayers was characterized with 51 an optimum activity at 15 mN/m, in the absence of bile salts. gPLRP2 showed enhanced adsorption 52 onto biomimetic model monolayer containing negatively charged lipids. However, the 53 compositional complexity in the heterogeneous uncharged model systems induced a lag phase 54 before the initiation of lipolysis. In bulk, no enzymatic activity could be demonstrated on GL-based 55 liposomes in the absence of bile salts, probably due to the high lateral pressure of the lipid bilayers. 56 In the presence of NaTDC (4 mM), however, gPLRP2 showed both high galactolipase and 57 moderate phospholipase A1 activities on liposomes, probably due to a decrease in packing and 58 lateral pressure upon NaTDC adsorption, and subsequent disruption of liposomes. 59\nKEYWORDS: pancreatic lipase related-protein 2, heterogeneous monolayers, galactolipids, 60 monolayer, liposomes 61\n62\nGalactolipids (GL) are the main lipids found in the photosynthetic membrane of plants and algae, 64 accounting for more than 70% wt. of the total membrane lipids (D\u00f6rmann, 2013; Douce et al., 65 1973; Gurevich et al., 1997). Due to the natural abundance of plants and algae on Earth, GL 66 represent the most important class of lipids, and therefore, the most important reservoir of fatty 67 acids (80% versus 20% wt. for plant phospholipids (PL) and TAG), including some essential 68 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (Gounaris & Barber, 1983). The two main GL composing the 69 photosynthetic membranes of plants are the neutral monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG, 53% 70\nwt.) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG, 27% wt.). MGDG possess a unique small 1--71\ngalactose polar head bound at the sn-3 position to a diacylglycerol (Lee, 2000), whereas DGDG 72\nhas a larger polar head with an additional -galactose, linked to -galactose (Mizusawa & Wada, 73\n2012). Both galactolipids possess two esterified acyl chains of fatty acids at the sn-1 and sn-2 74 position of the glycerol backbone, whose nature depends mainly on the synthesis pathway of GL 75 (Gl\u00f6ckner, 2013; Sahaka et al., 2020). In addition to these two glycolipids, photosynthetic plant 76 membranes contain smaller amounts of charged lipids, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) and 77 phosphatidylglycerol (PG), the proportions of which vary between photosynthetic plant species. 78\nGL are naturally rich in the essential -linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 3), which is the precursor of 79\nlonger chain 3 fatty acids, the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5, 3), and the docosahexaenoic 80\nacid (DHA, C22:6 3), resulting from elongation and desaturation reactions (Kergomard et al., 81\n2021). In particular, these two long-chain PUFA play a crucial role in the homeostatic regulation 82 of the human body by being the precursors of signaling oxygenated lipids involved in inflammation 83 resolution processes in our body (Saini & Keum, 2018). GL also contain a significant amount of 84\nhexadecatrienoic acid (HTA, C16:3 3), an unusual fatty acid found mainly in green plants and 85\nbiomarker of the digestion, absorption, and accretion of GL FA. Indeed, it has been found in tissues 87 of zebrafish fed with chloroplast-rich fractions (Gedi et al., 2019), as well as in the meat of horses 88 (Belaunzaran et al., 2018), and has been identified as a potential precursor of ALA in rodents 89 (Cunnane et al., 1995). The interesting nutritional profile of GL makes them compounds of interest 90\nfor the development of food products rich in 3 PUFA. Nevertheless, in order to exploit the 91\nnutritional properties of GL in potential food applications, it is necessary to determine their 92 digestibility by humans. 93\nRegarding this digestibility, human pancreatic juice and duodenal contents have been shown to 94 exhibit galactolipase activity (Andersson et al., 1995). This activity was associated to PLRP2 95 (Andersson et al., 1996), as well as, to a lesser extent, to the bile salt-simulated lipase/carboxyl 96 ester hydrolase (BSSL/CEH) (Amara et al., 2013; Bakala N\u2019Goma et al., 2012). PLRP2 shows 97 enzymatic activity on polar lipid substrates with larger heads in comparison with other classical 98 pancreatic lipases such as HPL. Indeed, in addition to lower lipase activity (1250 versus 8500 U/mg 99\nfor HPL on tributyrin), PLRP2 exhibits some phospholipase A1 (74 U/mg on purified L--PC) and 100\nhigh galactolipase (~2800 U/mg on MGDG for instance) activities (Amara et al., 2009; De Caro et 101 al., 2004; Sahaka et al., 2020; Wattanakul et al., 2019). This enzymatic activity on a wider range 102 of substrates than HPL is partly explained by the unusual conformation of the lid controlling the 103 access to the active site of hPLRP2 (Eydoux et al., 2008). PLRP2 is also present in the digestive 104 system of other species, and in particular in monogastric herbivores such as the guinea pig 105 (gPLRP2), whose diet contains significant amounts of GL. Although the galactolipase activity of 106 PLRP2 has been the subject of numerous studies, they were mainly focused on the identification 107 and quantification of enzyme activity on synthetic (medium chain acyl GL) or natural substrates 108\nwas given to the local physical state, whether regarding the level of condensation, nor the presence 110 of charged molecules. PLRP2 was also found to be active on monolayers of pure PL and GL, with 111 an optimum activity at surface pressures below the lateral surface pressure of membranes, i.e. 10-112 15 mN/m (Eydoux, De Caro, et al., 2007; Hjorth et al., 1993; Sias et al., 2004). These findings, 113 together with the absence of interaction and activity of PLRP2 on PL liposomes (Mateos-Diaz, 114 Bakala N\u2019Goma, et al., 2018), suggest that PLRP2 may not be able to act directly on plant 115 membranes. In the present study, gPLRP2, whose biochemical properties are close to those of 116 hPLRP2, was used as a model of PLRP2. We proposed to investigate the adsorption mechanisms 117 of PLRP2 on plant model and natural monolayers presenting homogeneous or heterogeneous 118 physical states at the air/water interface, as well as on GL liposomes in static dispersed condition, 119 hereafter called \u201cbulk\u201d, in the absence and presence of bile salts (NaTDC, 4 mM). Indeed, bile salts 120 are biosurfactants that are secreted by the liver, and which play key contrasting roles in lipid 121 digestion: they adsorb onto interfaces where they can compete with lipases and inhibit lipolysis 122 (Bezzine et al., 1999; Borgstr\u00f6m, 1975), but they also remove lipolysis products from the interface, 123 solubilizing them into micelles (Pabois et al., 2021). More importantly, they form mixed micelles 124 with polar lipids, i.e. PL and GL, that are the preferred substrates for pancreatic phospholipase A2 125 (Borgstr\u00f6m, 1993) and PLRP2 (Amara et al., 2010; Mateos-Diaz, Bakala N\u2019Goma, et al., 2018), 126 respectively. 127\nWe studied the organizational properties and enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 on different GL 128 substrates, controlling finely their physical state, i.e. on systems with or without phase 129 heterogeneities. The adsorption and enzymatic hydrolysis capacity of gPLRP2 were first tested on 130 homogeneous and heterogeneous monolayers of GL, PL, and pS (GL and GL/DPPC/pS 131\norder to gain a mechanistic understanding of the digestion mechanisms at the lipid interface 133 molecular level (nm). These three lipid mixtures were then formulated into liposomes and 134 incubated in the presence of gPLRP2 to determine if galactolipase and/or phospholipase A1 135 activities were displayed on these dispersed micronic objects (\u00b5m) either in the absence or presence 136 of bile salts (NaTDC). 137\nChloroform, methanol, SQDG, and PG were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Ltd. (St. Louis, MO). 139 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), MGDG and DGDG were purchased from Avanti 140 Polar Lipids. Canola pS, composed of a mixture of \u03b2-sitosterol (50 mol%), campesterol (40 mol%) 141 and brassicasterol (10 mol%), were kindly donated by Cognis France (Estarac, France). pS were 142 collected from desodorization distillates of canola oil. If not stated otherwise, all biophysical 143 characterizations were conducted at least in triplicate. 144\n2.1 Preparation of lipid mixtures 145\nBinary mixture of natural long chains MGDG and DGDG (60:40, mol/mol) was prepared, namely 146 (1) GL. Heterogeneous mixture of GL, DPPC and pS, namely (2) GL/DPPC/pS (45:45:10, 147 mol/mol/mol), respectively was also prepared both to simplify the composition of natural plant 148 membrane, and to provide a pronounced phase coexistence. A biomimetic model system was also 149 prepared, reproducing more accurately the composition of plant photosynthetic membranes, by the 150 addition of charged polar lipids, SQDG (predominant species C18:3/C16:0) and PG, and hereafter 151 called (3) MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG (56:24:10:10, mol/mol/mol/mol). Relative compositions of 152 the model systems and fatty acid repartitions of MGDG and DGDG used in this study are given in 153 Table S1 and Figure S2, respectively. 154\n2.2 Enzyme purification and preparation of aliquots 155\nRecombinant guinea pig pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (gPLRP2) and its inactive variant 156 gPLRP2 S125G were produced in Aspergillus orizae and Pichia pastoris, respectively, and purified 157 as described in Hjorth et al. (1993) and Mateos-Diaz et al. (2018). For the interfacial measurements, 158 a gPLRP2 stock solution (0.15 mg/mL) was prepared in a Tris HCl buffer (10 mM Tris, 100 mM 159\n0.128 mg/L (2.7 nM). This value is closed to the physiological concentrations divided by 100 and 161 corresponds to the usual value used in interfacial studies to avoid saturating the interface with 162 digestive proteins. The inactive gPLRP2 S125G variant was used as a control of the protein effect 163 on lipids in the absence of any enzyme activity as previously shown with phospholipids (Mateos-164 Diaz et al., 2018). For digestion experiments in static conditions, 100 \u00b5L aliquots were prepared at 165 a final concentration of 3.3 mg/L. 166\n2.3 Ellipsometry and surface pressure measurements at the air/water interface 167\nKinetic measurements were performed over 2 hours using a computer controlled and user-168 programmable LB Teflon Langmuir trough (KSV Nima, Helsinki, Finland) with a surface area of 169 35 cm\u00b2 controlled by two mobile barriers. The Teflon trough has been carefully cleaned with UP 170 water and ethanol before each experiment, and ellipsometric and tensiometric measurements were 171 performed during half an hour on pH 7 buffer to check the cleaned surface. 172\nThe surface pressure () was measured every 4s with a precision of \u00b1 0.2 mN/m using a filter paper 173\nconnected to a microelectronic feedback system (Nima Technology, UK), according to the 174\nWilhelmy-plate method. The ellipsometric angle () was recorded simultaneously every 4 s with a 175\nprecision of \u00b1 0.5\u00b0, using a home-made automated ellipsometer in a \u201cnull ellipsometer\u201d 176 configuration (Berge & Renault, 1993; Bourlieu et al., 2020). The laser beam probed a surface of 177 1 mm2 and a depth in the order of 1 \u00b5m and provided insight on the thickness of the interfacial film 178 formed at the interface. 179\n2.4 Monitoring of the gPLRP2 adsorption onto mixed galactolipid monolayers at the 180 air/water interface 181\nlipids in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v) over the surface of the buffer solution until an initial pressure of 183 20 \u00b1 1 mN/m (B\u00e9narouche et al., 2013). 184\nAfter stabilization of the film over 5 minutes, 14.6 \u00b5L of gPLRP2 solution (0.15 mg/mL) was 185 diluted with 30 \u00b5L Tris buffer and injected in the sub-phase to achieve a final gPLRP2 186 concentration of 2.7 nM. The evolution of the surface pressure and ellipsometric angle due to the 187 enzyme adsorption and lipolytic activity onto the lipid monolayer was continuously monitored over 188 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the system studied, until a final surface pressure of 6 mN/m 189 was reached, this value being the one of the gel-fluid phase transition of DPPC (Xu & Zuo, 2018). 190\n2.5 Analysis of the digestion products present at the interface and in the sub-phase 191\nThe interface of the GL monolayer was collected after 1h digestion kinetic, using a home-made 192 vacuum extraction pump system. Lipids were extracted by Folch method before being analyzed by 193 thin layer chromatography (TLC) to determine the concentrations of lipolysis products. The 194 organic phase resulting from the extraction was separated and eluted on TLC plates using a mixture 195 of chloroform/methanol/water (95:20:2.5, v/v/v). The TLC plate revelation was made by dipping 196 the plate in a 50:50 v/v mixture of saturated copper acetate solution in water and 85.5% phosphoric 197 acid solution and subsequent oven drying (180\u00b0C, 10min). Revealed bands were then scanned by 198 densitometry (500 nm, TLC Scanner 4, CAMAG) and quantified using VisionCat software. 199\n2.6 Visualization of lipase distribution in heterogeneous film by atomic force microscopy 200\nFor AFM imaging, interfacial films were transferred onto a freshly-cleaved mica plate using the 201 Langmuir-Blodgett method at the end of the kinetics, at a constant surface pressure and at a very 202 low speed (0.5 mm/min). For each monolayer, two sampling were performed at different times, in 203\nlipolysis. For the GL monolayer, sampling was performed at 35 minutes and 1 hour, respectively. 205 For the GL/DPPC monolayer, sampling was carried out at 45 minutes and 1 hour and 15 minutes, 206 respectively. For the GL/DPPC/pS monolayer, sampling was done at 45 minutes and 1 hour 45 207 minutes, respectively. Finally, for the MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG, sampling was carried out after 1 208 hour kinetic. AFM (Multimode Nanoscope 8, Bruker, France) was used for imaging in contact 209 mode QNM in air (20\u00b0C), using a standard silicon cantilevers (0.06 N/m, SNL-10, Bruker, France), 210 and at a scan rate of 1 Hz. The force was minimized during all scans and the scanner size was 211 100\u00d7100 \u00b5m\u00b2. The processed images analyzed by the open-source platform Gwyddion were 212 representative of at least duplicated experiments. 213\n2.7 Static digestion of liposomes made from mixed GL, GL/DPPS/pS, and 214 MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/pS systems by gPLRP2 215\n1 \u00b5m extruded liposomes of i) GL, ii) GL/DPPC/pS, and iii) MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG model 216 solutions, respectively, were prepared at a final concentration of 0.4% wt. in Tris HCl buffer (10 217 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7). 218\n2.6.1 Size distribution of liposomes by dynamic light scattering 219\nThe size (diameter, nm) distribution of liposomes was assessed by dynamic light scattering 220 (DLS) with a Malvern Panalytical Zetasizer PRO (Malvern, Worcestershire, United Kingdom) 221 fitted with a 633-nm He-Ne laser at 25\u202f\u00b0C. ZS Explorer Software version 3.1.0. (Malvern) was used 222 to collect and analyze the data. Measurement were conducted on 1 mL of liposomes dispersion 223 (after 10 times dilution in mQ water) with equilibration time of 120 s, 10 runs of 120\u202fs 224 measurements were performed with a refractive index of 1.45 for liposomes, respectively. The 225\nindex (PdI) were deduced from the autocorrelation fit of the data. 227\n2.6.2 Static bulk digestion of liposomes by gPLRP2 in absence and in presence of 4 228 mM NaTDC 229\nLiposomes were incubated under constant agitation in Tris HCl buffer (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 230 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7) containing gPLRP2 at 3.3 mg/L in absence or in presence of 4 mM NaTDC 231 (above CMC value). 100 \u00b5L aliquots were sampled at T0 (control) and after 5 min of gPLRP2 232 digestion (T5min), and lipids were extracted by Folch method before being analyzed by thin layer 233 chromatography (TLC) to determine the concentrations of residual substrates and lipolysis 234 products. The organic phase resulting from the extraction was separated and eluted on TLC plates 235 as detailed in section 2.5 above. It was thus possible to monitor the enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 236 on liposomes of both galactolipid mixtures in absence or presence of bile salt-related detergent 237 (NaTDC, 4 mM). 238\n239\n3.1. Interfacial behavior of model lipid monolayers 241\nLipid-lipid interactions and molecular organization at the air/water interface were investigated at 242 20 mN/m and pH 7 and are presented in Figure 1. We were able to form stable GL based-243 monolayers at the air/water interface. The GL interface was characterized by a fluid phase, 244 presenting some roughness due to the intercalation of the polar heads of MGDG and DGDG (Figure 245 1.A). The GL/DPPC/pS system showed a coexistence of condensed liquid/expanded liquid phases, 246 with the presence of condensed phase domains visible on the AFM images, enriched in DPPC-247 MGDG and pS (Figure 1.B). Additionally, the presence of pS in condensed domains have induced 248 the appearance of defects, that could modulate the subsequent adsorption of lipolytic enzymes 249 (Bourlieu et al., 2016; Kergomard, Carri\u00e8re, Paboeuf, Artzner, et al., 2022). For the 250 MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG biomimetic monolayer (Figure 1.C), small flower-shaped nanodomains 251 of 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 nm height were evidenced at the air/water interface, coexisting with a fluid phase. 252\n3.2. Interfacial adsorption and enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 onto homogeneous galactolipid 253 monolayer (GL) 254\nThe interfacial adsorption and enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 onto homogeneous GL monolayer 255 GL was monitored using tensiometry coupled with ellipsometric measurements. Figure 2.A shows 256 the evolution of surface pressure and ellipsometric angle over one hour after the injection of 257 gPLRP2 at 0.128 mg/L in the subphase. Right after the injection of the enzyme below the GL 258 monolayer, the surface pressure started to decrease drastically, reporting the modifications of the 259 interactions between molecules at the interface and the probable lipolysis of the acyl chains of 260 galactolipids by gPLRP2. When considering the maximal slope of this decreasing curve, it 261\nenzymatic activity of gPLRP2 was the highest. This assumption was consistent with the evolution 263\nof the ellipsometric angle, as a sharp drop of =0.8 was obtained at =15 mN/m (Figure 2.A). 264\nSince the activity of gPLRP2 on medium chain MGDG and DGDG monolayer was previously 265 reported to be maximum between 10 to 15 mN/m (De Caro et al., 2004; Eydoux, De Caro, et al., 266\n2007), it is hypothesized that the changes occurring at the interface ( and ) results from gPLRP2 267\nactivity on the GL monolayer. Given the fact that the surface pressure did not show a significant 268 increase after gPLRP2 injection, contrary to what had been previously observed with other lipases 269 onto heterogeneous monolayers (Bourlieu et al., 2016), it is hypothesized that most gPLRP2 270 molecules are found right below the surface and do not penetrate into the monolayer. This 271 assumption was consistent with the ellipsometric angle data: no evolution was observed during the 272 first 0.6 hour of kinetic after the lipase injection in the subphase. These data suggest that gPLRP2 273 adsorption below the surface is quite discrete and limited in comparison to gastric lipase for 274 instance (Bourlieu et al., 2016). 275\nIn order to understand the partitioning of the enzyme and the disorganization of the interface 276 induced by the enzymatic activity, two Langmuir-Blodgett sampling of the interface were realized; 277 before and after the drop of the ellipsometric angle. The 5\u00d75 \u00b5m\u00b2 AFM images of the two samples, 278 after 35 min and 1 hour kinetic, respectively, are presented in Figure 2.B. After 35 min of enzymatic 279 kinetic, small flower-like condensed phase domains of 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 nm height appeared at the air/water 280 interface, presumably attributed to the generation of digestion products by the degradation of 281 MGDG and DGDG by gPLRP2, in agreement with the subsequent decrease of the surface pressure. 282 Protuberances of 3.6 \u00b1 0.3 nm height were also visible, very likely being attributed to some lipase 283 molecules adsorbed at the interface. Indeed, such height differences had previously been shown in 284\nmonolayer (Kergomard, Carri\u00e8re, Paboeuf, Barouh, et al., 2022; Sarkis & Vi\u00e9, 2020). After 1 hour 286 kinetic, the resulting interface had evolved further. Surprisingly, gPLRP2 seems to have formed a 287 protein network of 3.4 \u00b1 0.1 nm in height, in addition to the protuberances observed on the 35 min 288 images, despite the absence of increase in the surface pressure. Additionally, condensed phase 289 domains have grown, reinforcing the hypothesis of their attribution to the generation of lipolysis 290 products. 291\nIndeed, gPLRP2 is known to hydrolyze the sn-1 position of GL, according to the reaction scheme 292 proposed in Figure 3, generating monogalactosylmonoacylglycerol (MGMG) and 293 digalactosylmonoacylglycerol (DGMG) in the case of MGDG and DGDG, respectively, as well as 294 free fatty acids (FFA) (Amara et al., 2010; Withers-Martinez et al., 1996). Due to their 295 polyunsaturated content, it is likely that MGMG and DGMG molecules remained in the fluid phase 296 at the air/water interface, and that the condensed phase domains were probably enriched in 297 saturated fatty acids released by PLRP2. Further hydrolysis of MGMG and DGMG by gPLRP2 298 can also lead to the production of water-soluble galactosylated products: monogalactosylglycerol 299 (MGG) and digalactosylglycerol (DGG) (Figure 3) (Sahaka et al., 2021). The generation of MGG 300 and DGG could explain the decrease in surface pressure after gPLRP2 injection, as well as the drop 301 in the ellipsometric angle corresponding to a loss of matter at the air/water interface. Additionally, 302 the reorganization of these lipolysis products at the interface and in the aqueous subphase may have 303 resulted in the formation of structural defects, thereby promoting lipolysis. To support the 304 hypothesis of a galactolipid degradation by gPLRP2, leading to the generation of digestion 305 products, the interface and subphase were collected after 1h of kinetics, and the lipid products were 306 analyzed by TLC. The results (supplementary data, Figure S3) indicated the presence of digestion 307\ngPLRP2 on the GL model monolayer. 309\nTo check which part of the evolution of the surface pressure and the ellipsometric angle was 310 resulting either from the galactolipase activity of gPLRP2, or from the interactions of the protein 311 with the lipid monolayer, the experiment was reproduced using an inactive variant (S125G) of 312 gPLRP2. In this variant, the catalytic serine S152 was replaced by a glycine, resulting in the loss 313 of the enzymatic activity. The S125G variant of gPLRP2 has been previously characterized using 314 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in the study of Mateos-Diaz et al. (2018), showing 315 that the inactive variant retained his correct folding compared to active gPLRP2, and that its 316 interfacial behavior should not be affected. 317\nFigure 4.A. presents the kinetic evolution of the surface pressure and ellipsometric angle over 1 318 hour after the injection of the inactive variant of gPLRP2 into the subphase of the GL monolayer. 319 After the S125G gPLRP2 injection in the subphase, there was no evolution in the surface pressure, 320 nor in the ellipsometric angle, confirming that the variations previously observed with gPLRP2 321 (Figure 2.A) were due to enzymatic activity. Additionally, AFM image Figure 4.B showed the 322 presence of the same protuberances observed with the active enzyme, with similar height of 3.8 \u00b1 323 0.2 nm. Thus, it seems that, despite the lack of surface pressure increase, the enzyme gets adsorbed 324 at the interface. 325\n3.3. Modulation of the gPLRP2 adsorption and kinetic activity onto heterogeneous model 326 monolayer of galactolipids, phospholipids and phytosterols (GL/DPPC/pS) 327\nFigure 5.A shows the kinetic evolution of the surface pressure and ellipsometric angle after the 328 injection of gPLRP2 below the GL/DPPC/pS monolayer. A decrease with time in the surface 329\nafter the injection of the enzyme in the subphase. However, the decrease in surface pressure was 331\nslower than with the GL monolayer. A drop in the ellipsometric angle (=0.9\u00b0) was also observed 332\nwhen the surface pressure reached 15 mN/m, but it occurred at 1.4 h instead of 0.6 h (35 min) with 333 the GL monolayer, reflecting the slowing down of the lipolysis rate. As previously, we assumed 334 that these variations correspond to a loss of matter at the interface, upon lipolysis of the monolayer 335 by gPLRP2 and to the generation of water-soluble MGG and DGG. The lag phase of about 50 min 336 observed with the GL/DPPC/pS monolayer before the initiation of lipolysis could be explained by 337 the higher packing of the heterogeneous monolayer induced by DPPC and pS, and a greater 338 difficulty for gPLRP2 to reach the acyl chains of hydrolysable substrates (galactolipids and DPPC). 339 The previous characterization study of homogeneous and heterogeneous GL monolayers has 340 indeed shown that the addition of DPPC and pS to a GL monolayer led to the formation of 341 condensed phase domains enriched in DPPC and MGDG, reducing the lateral distance between the 342 acyl chains available for gPLRP2 to insert (Kergomard, Carri\u00e8re, Paboeuf, Artzner, et al., 2022). 343 This higher packing could thus explain the lag phase observed before the gPLRP2 could reach its 344 optimum activity, a high packing density at the air/water interface having been proposed to explain 345 the long induction times observed for other lipases onto tightly packed short-chained phospholipids 346 (Verger et al., 1973) and diacylglycerols (Wieloch et al., 1982) monolayers. The initiation of 347 lipolysis of the GL/DPPC/pS led however to the formation of lipolysis products and to the 348 subsequent decrease in surface pressure and lipid packing, that accelerate the activity of gPLRP2. 349\nTwo Langmuir-Blodgett transfers of the monolayer were taken after 45 minutes and 1h45 of 350 kinetics, respectively, and AFM images of the interfacial organization were recorded (Figure 5.B). 351 After 45 minutes of kinetics, condensed domains of 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 nm in height were visible at the 352\nprobably not related to the generation of digestion products. Furthermore, the interfacial 354 organization and heights observed were similar to those obtained at T0 before the injection of 355 gPLRP2 into the subphase (Figure 1.B), supporting the hypothesis that lipolysis is probably not yet 356 initiated at this stage of the kinetics. At 1h45 minutes of kinetics, the surface pressure had reached 357\n=6.3 mN/m, and AFM images of the film interface revealed a very different interfacial 358\norganization, consistent with the evolution of surface pressure and the drop in the ellipsometric 359 angle. Thin and discontinuous lines of h1=3.1 \u00b1 0.2 nm in height were visible in the fluid phase and 360 around the condensed domains, that could correspond to gPLRP2 molecules adsorbed at the 361 monolayer interface. Condensed domains of three different heights were also identified. First, small 362 flower-like shaped condensed domains were visible in the fluid phase, with a height h2 of 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 363 nm, probably attributed to the generation of lipolysis product MGMG and DGMG, as observed for 364 the GL monolayer. Fragmented condensed phase domains were also revealed, composed of at least 365 three different height levels (h3, h4, fluid bottom). This observed fragmentation could be due to 366 the disorganization caused by the adsorption and enzymatic activity of gPLRP2, but also to the 367\nlow-pressure value (=6.3 mN/m), causing phase segregation within the condensed phase domains 368\nthought to be enriched in DPPC-MGDG-pS. Indeed, the lateral pressure was probably no longer 369 sufficient to ensure the miscibility of DPPC and pS with MGDG, causing phase segregation which 370 could explains the observed height differences. 371\nThese observations nevertheless confirm the miscibility of these three compounds and the phase 372 heterogeneity in the condensed phase domains at 20 mN/m , as well as the condensation effect of 373 DPPC and pS on MGDG chains observed in our previous study (Kergomard, Carri\u00e8re, Paboeuf, 374 Artzner, et al., 2022). Given the molar composition of the GL/DPPC/pS monolayer, the central 375\ncondensed DPPC. The smaller domains of h3 and h4 heights, coexisting with the fluid phase, could 377 be attributed to the presence of FFA and pS, coexisting with MGDG and MGMG in the fluid phase. 378\nIn the considered range of surface pressure, it is indeed unlikely that gPLRP2 shows significant 379 enzymatic activity on DPPC, since monolayer studies have shown that gPLRP2 was only active on 380\nthis substrate at low surface pressure ( < 5 mN/m) and was totally inactive at  > 10 mN/m (Hjorth 381\net al., 1993). However, it remains difficult to attribute each type of domain to a species of molecule, 382 given the complex interactions and differences in miscibility observed in this type of ternary 383 mixture. Surface composition studies will be needed to answer these questions, but the small 384 quantities used for interfacial characterizations do not facilitate such analyses. 385\n3.4. Influence of the presence of charged lipids on the adsorption capacity and enzymatic 386 activity of gPLRP2 in model biomimetic lipid monolayer (MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG) 387\nThe impact of a charged interface on the adsorption capacities and enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 388 was studied using MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG biomimetic model monolayer. The evolution of 389 surface pressure and ellipsometric angle upon the adsorption of gPLRP2 at the air/water interface 390 is presented Figure 6.A. A continuous decrease of the surface pressure was observed right after the 391\ninjection of gPLRP2 in the sub-phase until it reached a value of =8.5 mN/m after 1h of kinetic. In 392\ncontrast to the GL/DPPC/pS complex system, no lag phase was observed before the onset of 393 lipolysis, and the decrease was continuous, revealing a constant enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 over 394 the 1h kinetic. This observation could be explained by the presence of negatively charged lipids at 395 the interface (SQDG, PG), which could facilitate the adsorption of gPLRP2 underneath the 396 monolayer, and the subsequent degradation of galactolipids. The facilitated adsorption onto a 397 charged surface was previously observed for recombinant dog gastric lipase (rDGL) at the level of 398\nbetween the interface and the interfacial recognition site facilitating the orientation and approach 400 of the active site onto the lipid substrates (Bourlieu et al., 2016). In our case however the surface 401 potential electrostatic distribution of charge is very different between rDGL and gPLRP2, but 402 seems to result in favorable interactions with negatively charged lipid interface. The ellipsometric 403 angle did not significantly evolved during the first 30 minutes of the kinetics. After this, it 404\ndecreased again (=-0.7\u00b0) at =15 mN/m, in the range of the optimal surface pressure for the 405\nactivity of gPLRP2, as previously observed on GL and GL/DPPC/pS monolayers. The 406\nellipsometric angle then slowly decreased until it reached a value of =5.2\u00b0 after 1h kinetic, 407\nreflecting a decrease in the thickness of the monolayer due to the degradation of GL and the 408 progressive release of polar lipolysis products into the subphase. 409\nLangmuir-Blodgett transfer of the interface was performed on the MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG 410 monolayer after 1 kinetic. AFM image (Figure 6.B) after 1h kinetic of incubation with gPLRP2 411 showed the coexistence of LC snowflake-shape domains of 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 in height in the fluid phase. 412 These domains shared a similar morphology with those obtained after 35 minutes of digestion of 413 the GL monolayer by gPLRP2, and can therefore be attributed to the generation of FFA digestion 414 products by galactolipid degradation. As previously observed, small protuberances of 3.3 \u00b1 0.3 nm 415 in height were also observed, attributed to the adsorbed gPLRP2 molecules in the fluid phase. 416\n3.5. Interaction of liposomal structures (GL, GL/DPPC/pS, MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG) with 417 bile salts 418\nSince the interfacial characterization of gPLRP2 interaction with mixed galactolipid monolayer 419 revealed some lipolytic activity, we then evaluate the ability of gPLRP2 to interact with liposomes 420\nfound in the gastrointestinal tract. We first characterized the effects of bile salts on the liposomal 422 dispersions using DLS. 423\nIn the absence of bile salts, GL liposomes showed a monomodal distribution centered at 198 nm 424 while GL/DPPC/pS liposomes were much larger with a monomodal distribution centered at 2990 425 nm (Figure 7), although both objects had been extruded 10 times over filters of 1 \u00b5m pore diameter. 426 Upon the addition of NaTDC (4 mM), bimodal distributions appeared with peaks at 894 and 117 427 nm for GL liposomes and at 2990 and 146 nm for GL/DPPC/pS. The presence of NaTDC had 428 therefore a strong impact on lipid organization with changes in particle size distribution, a major 429 shift towards larger objects but also the appearance of smaller populations. Ultimately, GL and PL 430 mixed with micellar concentrations of bile salts are known to form mixed micelles with diameter 431 of 10 to 40 nm (Mazer et al., 1980). In that case, DLS is not the most appropriate techniques for 432 covering such large variations in particle size distribution. Nevertheless, it allowed showing lipid 433 re-organization upon the addition of bile salts. The size increase observed with the larger objects 434 could be partially explained by a destabilization of the liposomes during the adsorption of NaTDC 435 at the interface, leading to their fusion. Additionally, the adsorption of NaTDC onto liposomes 436 could have resulted in a diminished GL packing, explaining the larger diameter observed. The 437 smallest objects observed could be related to the desorption of some lipid molecules from the 438 bilayer stabilizing the liposomes. Indeed, previous studies had already investigated the interfacial 439 behavior of NaTDC at the level of assembled lipid structures, and have highlighted its desorption 440 capacities. As an example, (Pabois et al., 2019) have studied the adsorption behavior of NaTDC at 441 the air/water interface, and its interaction with a monolayer of phospholipids (DPPC), mimicking 442 the organization of physiological compounds present at the interface of fat droplets. Firstly, the 443\n1 mM), forming stable but irregular film, which was attributed to its unusual polar planar structure 445 and large surface area (Maldonado-Valderrama et al., 2011, 2014). However, these bile salt 446 concentrations were below the critical micellar concentration (CMC) (Roda et al., 1983). At higher 447 concentrations (> 5 mM; i.e. > CMC), the addition of bile salts was shown to lead to a decrease in 448 thickness, demonstrating that NaTDC partially desorbs from the interface. The interaction of 449 NaTDC with the DPPC was then studied. Results showed the strong desorption of DPPC molecules 450 (to approximately 40%) from the interface upon the NaTDC adsorption, resulting in the formation 451 of domains with distinct organization. Additionally, increasing the amount of NaTDC have been 452 shown to decrease the DPPC monolayer packing. These results illustrate the well-known micellar 453 solubilization effect of bile salts, leading to the formation of mixed micelles in bulk (Hofmann, 454 1963; Hofmann & Borgstr\u00f6m, 1964; Pabois et al., 2021). 455\nIn the case of the GL/DPPC/pS liposomes in the absence of bile salts, they showed an average 456 diameter of 2990 nm that was much larger than the average diameter measured in the case of the 457 GL system (198 nm). The fact that their diameter was larger than 1 \u00b5m despite the filter used during 458 extrusion indicates that these objects were relatively stable, as they were able to deform during 459 extrusion without breaking. The appearance of a population of smaller objects upon addition of 460 NaTDC could reflect the re-organization induced by NaTDC molecules. Nevertheless, it seems 461 that the GL/DPPC/pS system remains stable even in the presence of bile salts, as the population of 462 larger droplets remained similar in size in the absence and presence of bile salts 463\n3.6. Interaction of gPLRP2 with galactolipid-based liposomes in the absence and presence of 464 bile salts 465\norganization (Mateos-Diaz, Bakala N\u2019Goma, et al., 2018; Mateos-Diaz, Sutto-Ortiz, et al., 2018), 467 the changes observed with liposomes following the addition of bile salts could most likely modify 468 the access of the enzyme to its substrate and its lipolytic activity. 469\nThe impact of bile salt on the galactolipase and phospholipase A1 activities of gPLRP2 was thus 470 assayed in \u201cbulk conditions\u201d using GL/DPPC/pS dispersed liposomes, this system having been 471 shown to be the most stable even in presence of bile salts. No significant hydrolysis activity on 472 GL/DPPC/pS liposomes could be detected in the absence of bile salts after 5 minutes of incubation 473 with gPLRP2 (supplementary material, Table S4). This result was in line with the previous study 474 by Mateos-Diaz et al. (2018), which has shown that gPLRP2 did not possess enzymatic activity on 475 DPPC liposomes in absence of bile salts. These results were however in disagreement with the 476 results obtained with monolayers of the same lipid mixture, on which the lipolytic activity of 477 gPLRP2 was detected (see figure 2 presented in section 3.3 - monolayer results ). Nevertheless, the 478 surface pressure of the lipid monolayer at the air/water interface was optimum for the adsorption 479 and enzymatic activity of gPLRP2, which may explain the observed lipolysis under these 480 conditions. The organization of lipids into monolayers is indeed different from that of the bilayers 481 surrounding liposomes, and higher lateral pressure and packing of the latter systems could prevent 482 gPLRP2 from penetrating and degrading its substrate (Kergomard, Carri\u00e8re, Paboeuf, Artzner, et 483 al., 2022). 484\nHowever, when bile salts were added to GL/DPPC/pS liposomes, a lipolytic activity of gPLRP2 485 could be detected by TLC analysis of lipolysis products (Table 1). After 5-min incubation, around 486 74% wt. of MGDG and 55% wt. of DGDG were converted into MGMG and DGMG, respectively, 487 with the production of FFA. Given the differences in the substrate and lipolysis product 488\nmonogalactosylglycerol (MGG) and digalactosylglycerol (DGG), respectively, by gPLRP2 but 490 these two compounds being water-soluble, they could not be extracted and revealed upon TLC 491 analysis of the organic phase (Sahaka, 2020). It should be noted that the quantification of DGMG 492 after 5 minutes digestion was hampered, given the fact that its retention factor was similar to that 493 of DPPC on the TLC plate. The galactolipase activity observed in the presence of bile salts could 494 be due to the adsorption of NaTDC at the liposome interface, decreasing the lateral pressure and 495 interfacial packing of polar lipids, as previously observed with DPPC domains (Pabois et al. 2019), 496 and thus creating more favorable conditions for the adsorption and activity of gPLRP2. 497 Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that polar lipids from liposomes were gradually solubilized 498 into mixed micelles prior to their hydrolysis by gPLRP2. This latter hypothesis is supported by the 499 preference of gPLRP2 for micellar substrates (Mateos-Diaz, Bakala N\u2019Goma, et al., 2018). 500 Moreover, the difficulty for gPLRP2 to access it substrate in liposomes was confirmed here when 501 GL/DPPC/pS liposomes were tested in the absence of bile salts. 502\nIn addition to the galactolipase activity of gPLRP2, the TLC analysis of lipolysis products also 503 revealed the phospholipase activity of gPLRP2 on the DPPC present in GL/DPPC/pS liposomes, 504 in the presence of bile salts. These results confirm the previous study by Mateos-Diaz et al. (2018) 505 which has shown that gPLRP2 was active on mixed bile salts/DPPC micelles, but not on DPPC 506 liposomes in the absence of bile salts. As in the case of galactolipid hydrolysis, two main 507 hypotheses can be raised about the mode of action of gPLRP2 on PL: a decrease in the packing of 508 the bilayer by bile salts that could promote gPLRP2 adsorption and activity, or the conversion of 509 liposomes into micelles containing DPPC. 510\nMGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG liposomes mimicking the lipid composition of thylakoid membranes 512 were also tested in presence of bile salts. After 5 minutes incubation with gPLRP2 in presence of 513 4 mM NaTDC (Table 1), about 90% wt. of MGDG and 94% wt. of DGDG were hydrolyzed, while 514 FFA and MGDG were produced. More interestingly, gPLRP2 was also able to hydrolyze 91% of 515 the initial SQDG substrate (Table 1), emphasizing its action on all galactolipids (Andersson et al., 516 1996). This result confirmed the ability of gPLRP2 to hydrolyze GL from liposomes in the presence 517 of bile salts. 518\nThe ability of gPLRP2 to hydrolyze galactolipid membranes even in the absence of bile salts was 519 however recently shown by FTIR on natural chloroplast membranes (Sahaka et al., 2023). This 520 result could be explained by the fact that these natural systems are more complex than the model 521 systems considered in this study, and naturally include negatively charged lipids, shown to enhance 522 the adsorption and extent of lipolysis on model monolayers, independently of the presence of bile 523 salts. Thus, pursuing this study by exploring the degradation of liposomes with more complex 524 compositions in the absence of bile salts, for example MGDG/DGDG/SQDG/PG, could provide 525 insight into the composition at which a galactolipid liposome can become a gPLRP2 substrate. 526\n3.7. Interfacial organization of GL and GL/DPPC/pS liposomes in presence of bile salts 527 obtained at T0 and after 5 min of gPLRP2 digestion 528\nLipids products obtained at T0 and after 5 minutes incubation of GL or GL/DPPC/pS liposomes in 529 the presence of gPLRP2 and bile salts were extracted by Folch method and deposited at the 530\nair/water interface at =7.2 \u00b1 0.1 mN/m. We chose to deposit the lipids at this surface pressure in 531\norder to approximate the organization of the substrates and digestion products of the interfacial 532 films obtained at the end of the monolayer digestion kinetics for the GL, GL/DPPC/pS, and 533\nthe respective T0 and T5min films, Langmuir-Blodgett samples were observed in AFM. For both 535 systems, the images obtained at T0 and T5min are displayed in Figure 8. For the GL system, AFM 536 images obtained at T0 revealed the presence of small condensed domains of h1=1.3 \u00b1 0.1 nm height, 537 that could be attributed to the presence of some NaTDC adsorbed at the air/water interface. At 538 T5min, flower-shape domains of h1\u2019=1.9 \u00b1 0.1 nm in height were evidenced, similar to those obtained 539 after 2h hour kinetic digestion of GL monolayer by gPLRP2 at the air/water interface. These 540 domains were attributed to the generation of the FFA by lipolysis of MGDG and DGDG, in 541 agreement with their detection by TLC (Table 1). 542\nFor the GL/DPPC/pS system, the interface obtained at  was clearly different from the one 543 obtained for the GL/DPPC/pS monolayer at 20 mN/m during the interfacial study (section 3.1), but 544 was similar to the one obtained two hours after injecting gPLRP2 in the subphase, when the surface 545\npressure reached =6.3 mN/m (Figure 2B). Thus, the low surface pressure could explain the 546\nfragmentation of the condensed phase domains, as previously observed, with two identified height 547 levels (h1 and h2) probably enriched in DPPC and pS, coexisting with a fluid phase probably 548 enriched in MGDG. Additionally, the inclusion of bile salts at the interface could have spaced out 549 the neighboring DPPC molecules, thus disordering their tight packing and the interfacial 550 organization (Chu et al., 2010). At T5min, the highest domains became more numerous, probably 551 related to the generation of FFA, with a height h1'=1.7 \u00b1 0.1 nm. The organization of the interface 552 was similar to that obtained in the images at 2h kinetics after injection of gPLRP2 in the subphase 553 of GL/DPPC/pS monolayers, highlighting the galactolipase activity of gPLRP2 at the level of 554 heterogeneous liposomes in the presence of bile salts, but also at the level of heterogeneous 555 monolayers. 556\nThe adsorption and enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 was studied on GL-based substrates exhibiting 558 different supramolecular structures, and presenting or not phase heterogeneity. The galactolipase 559 activity of gPLRP2 was evidenced at the level of both homogeneous GL and heterogenous 560 GL/DPPC/pS monolayers, after a decrease in surface pressure that allowed reaching the optimum 561 range for gPLRP2 activity on substrate monolayers (Amara et al., 2013; Eydoux, Caro, et al., 2007; 562 Hjorth et al., 1993; Sias et al., 2004). The presence of charged lipids (SQDG, PG) at the interface 563 improved the adsorption capacities of the enzyme through the establishment of electrostatic 564 interactions between the substrate and the interfacial recognition site of the active site, resulting in 565 improved adsorption and enzymatic activity of gPLRP2. The optimal activity of gPLRP2 was 566 obtained at a surface pressure of 15 mN/m for homogeneous or heterogeneous systems, even if the 567 tighter packing of the heterogeneous monolayer has induced a lag phase period before the on-set 568 of the lipolysis. 569\nHowever, no galactolipase activity could be detected on liposomes made with the same lipid 570 mixtures, confirming the previous finding that gPLRP2 does not interact with phospholipid (DPPC) 571 liposomes and does not display phospholipase A1 on this form of substrate. Therefore, galactolipid-572 based liposomes are not equivalent to monolayers of the same lipids in terms of recognition by 573 gPLRP2. Since we have shown that gPLRP2 preferentially binds at boundaries between liquid and 574 condensed phases in monolayers, one can assume that lateral packing of lipid molecules and phase 575 heterogeneity are not the same in liposomes. gPLRP2 adsorption to heterogeneous monolayers 576 induces a decrease in surface pressure that further accelerates enzyme activity. This mechanism of 577 action seems to be impaired with liposomes in the absence of bile salts. 578\nheterogeneous GL/DPPC/pS liposomes were incubated in the presence of bile salts. Bile salt 580 adsorption onto the liposomes can accelerate enzyme activity by changing the interfacial properties 581 and this is probably one of the mechanisms by which gPLRP2 becomes active on liposomes. 582 However, knowing the micellar solubilization properties of bile salts on polar lipids and the 583 preference of gPLRP2 for micellar substrates, one can speculate that lipolysis of both GL and PL 584 rapidly proceeds through liposomes disruption and formation of mixed micelles onto which 585 gPLRP2 preferentially binds. 586\nMonolayer studies with heterogeneous lipid films revealed that the presence of surfactants like bile 587 salts is not an absolute requirement to accelerate gPLRP2 activity on GL. It is now tempting to 588 investigate whether gPLRP2 can act directly on plant membranes. 589\n590\nCONCLUSION 591\nThe enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 was evidenced onto the galactolipid-based monolayers, with an 592 optimum activity in the range of 10 to 15 mN/m, in the absence of bile salts. The adsorption 593 capacity of gPLRP2 and the subsequent extent of lipolysis, however, was dependent on the 594 chemical composition, but also on the physical environment of the monolayer substrates. In bulk, 595 no enzymatic activity has been evidenced on GL-based liposomes in the absence of bile salts, 596 probably due to the high lateral pressure of the lipid bilayers. In the presence of NaTDC (4 mM), 597 however, gPLRP2 showed both high galactolipase and moderate phospholipase A1 activities on 598 liposomes, probably due to a decrease in packing and lateral pressure upon NaTDC adsorption, and 599 subsequent disruption of liposomes. 600\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships 603 that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. 604 605 Funding 606 This research work has been conducted thanks to a research grant from the French Ministry of 607 Research. 608 609 Acknowledgments 610 The authors would like to thank the BIOMIF platform (\u2018Biological Molecules at fluid interfaces\u2019, 611 IPR, Rennes, France) for allowing the biophysical characterization of samples presented in this 612 article. 613 C.
