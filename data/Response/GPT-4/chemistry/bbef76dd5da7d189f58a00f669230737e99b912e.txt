Comparative Analysis of Antibiotic Bioaccumulation Across Different Bivalve Species: Investigating the variance in antibiotic bioaccumulation across various bivalve species could help identify species that are particularly sensitive or resistant to contaminants. This research could lead to a better understanding of species-specific bioaccumulation mechanisms and inform targeted biomonitoring and conservation strategies.

Long-term Impact Studies on Aquatic Ecosystems: Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impacts of antibiotic contamination in aquatic ecosystems, particularly focusing on the cascading effects on trophic levels and ecosystem functions. This research could elucidate the chronic impacts of antibiotics on biodiversity, food web dynamics, and ecosystem services.

Development of Novel Bioremediation Techniques: Explore the development of innovative bioremediation techniques using microorganisms or plants to remove or degrade antibiotics in aquatic environments. This research could include genetic engineering approaches to enhance the biodegradation capabilities of specific species or the use of constructed wetlands as natural filtration systems.

Evaluation of Human Health Risks: Investigate the human health implications of consuming bivalves contaminated with antibiotics, including the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections. This research could extend to assessing the effectiveness of current cooking methods in degrading antibiotics and exploring dietary exposure risks in different populations.

Advanced Detection and Monitoring Technologies: Develop and validate advanced detection and monitoring technologies for antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant genes in aquatic environments. Research could focus on real-time monitoring systems, portable detection devices, and the integration of high-throughput sequencing technologies to identify and quantify a broader range of contaminants and resistance mechanisms.
