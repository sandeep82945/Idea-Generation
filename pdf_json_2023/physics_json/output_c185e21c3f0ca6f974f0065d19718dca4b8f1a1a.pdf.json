    "abstractText": "Two simple and rapid chromatographic methods were developed and validated for the analysis of levamisole and tric\u2010 labendazole simultaneously in pure and pharmaceutical products. The first method is thin\u2010layer chromatography (TLC) with densitometry, and the second method is high\u2010performance liquid chromatography with PDA detection (HPLC\u2013PDA). A Hypersil BDS C18 column with dimensions of 4.6 \u00d7 150 mm and a particle size of 5 \u03bcm was used in the HPLC\u2013PDA method. An isocratic condition was used to carry out the separation, and the mobile phase was made up of acetonitrile and a 0.03 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer in double\u2010distilled water. The ratio of the mobile phase preparation was 70:30 (v/v), and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. A wavelength of 215 nm was employed for analyte detection. Precoated silica gel 60 F254 aluminium plates were used for the TLC method\u2019s separation. Mobile phase was made of ethyl acetate, hexane, methanol, and ammonia (69:15:15:1) for the separation. The detection wavelength selected was 215 nm. Accord\u2010 ing to the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, the proposed methods were validated and it was found that the two chromatographic methods are accurate, precise, and linear for both compounds in the range of 3.75\u201337.5 and 6\u201360 mg/L for the HPLC method for levamisole and triclabendazole, respectively and in the range of 2\u201314 \u03bcg/spot for the TLC method. The developed methods greenness profile was assessed using AGREE and ComplexGAPI tools.",

            "heading": "Introduction",
            "text": "One of the primary factors causing economic losses in the sheep breed business is intestinal nematode infections [1, 2]. Veterinarians are now employing a variety of anthelmintic medication in combination to promptly treat animals as the incidence of parasite resistance continues to rise [2]. Martibendazene is an oral suspension formula that consists of two active ingredients with distinct pharmacological actions on sheep GIT worms [3, 4]. The anthelmintic drugs used are levamisole hydrochloride (LEVA) and triclabendazole (TCBZ), their chemical structures are illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 1. The concurrent administration of LEVA with TCBZ has been observed to result in superior therapeutic outcomes and accelerated amelioration of hepatic pathologies in naturally infected sheep afflicted with Fasciola species [4]. LEVA (C11H12N2S) is effectively eradicating the parasitic infection known as ascariasis in the human population. Additionally, it exhibits activity against the hookworm parasite, whereas LEVA demonstrates limited efficacy in treating enterobiasis and trichuriasis. The racemic form tetramisole is less effective at killing worms than LEVA [5]. In 1990\u2019s, the FDA approved the use of Levamisole as a colon cancer adjuvant therapy [6]. Previously, levamisole was employed as a therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis [7]. The findings support claims that levamisole has immunomodulatory qualities that make it effective for improving immunological response even in\nseverely compromised folks [8, 9]. The trial also showed that LEVA is clinically effective in treating people with mild coronavirus infection (COVID-19) [10].\nTCBZ (C14H9Cl3N2OS), is a type of benzimidazole anthelmintic that is specifically recommended for the treatment of sheep and other types of cattle. In ovine and bovine animals, this treatment is effective in eliminating early immature and mature Fasciola species [11, 12]. Triclabendazole\u2019s effectiveness against Fasciola infections in livestock has been documented since the 1980\u2019s [13]. Following oral administration, the triclabendazole that is absorbed cannot be identified in the plasma due to its rapid clearance by the liver. The liver metabolizes the triclabendazole into triclabendazole sulfoxide and triclabendazole sulphone [14]. Since the dosage form of LEVA with TCBZ is new and to simultaneously analyze both medications in the new dosage form, we had to design new methodology and validate it.\nFor the quantitative determination of LEVA by itself or with the combination of other medications either in its pure form or in dosage forms or its degradation form or in the presence of metabolites, a variety of techniques have been documented. These techniques include high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detection (HPLC\u2013UV) [14\u201326], with mass spectrometry detection (HPLC\u2013MS/MS) [27\u201329], liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detection (LCUV) [30], with mass spectrometry detection (LC\u2013MS/ MS) [31\u201334], ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) [35], gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) [36\u201338], high performance thin-layer chromatographic methods (TLC) [38, 39], capillary electrophoresis [38, 40, 41], spectrophotometric methods [42], potentiometric methods [43, 44], electrochemiluminescence [45], electro-membrane extraction [46],\nand electrochemically using electrodes modified with boron-doped diamond [47]. The concentration of TCBZ alone or in combination with other medications has been measured using a variety of techniques, including high performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detection (HPLC\u2013UV), pharmaceutical dosage forms, biological fluids, and in the presence of its metabolites [48\u201354], with fluorescence detection [55], liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection [56], with mass spectrometry detection (LC\u2013MS/ MS) [57, 58], spectrofluorometric method [59], and spectrophotometric methods [60]. To our knowledge, none of these techniques quantitively analyzed both drugs except one spectrophotometric method [61].\nIn analytical chemistry laboratories, the optimization of chromatographic conditions to quantitatively analyse the binary mixture is a challenging undertaking, this requires numerous trials conducted by experienced analysts, as well as scientific predictions of how the drugs will behave chromatographically corresponding to their structures. The main aim of this study is the development of robust, sensitive, and optimized chromatographic techniques for determining LEVA and TCBZ simultaneously either in pure forms or dosage form. The present study aims to develop with optimized conditions of reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC coupled with photodiode array detector (PDA) and TLC-densitometry methods. These methods aim to facilitate the rapid separation of the investigated compounds. The proposed methods were fully validated and statistically analyzed according to ICH parameters [62]. For quality control analysis of the aforementioned pharmaceuticals\u2019 with the lack of interference of excipients, it can be applied for regular analysis in a variety of pharmaceutical companies.\nCalculating the greenness profile of two the methods were performed using AGREE and ComplexGAPI softwares. AGREE which is abbreviation of Analytical GREEnness metric approach consists of 12 principles in green analytical chemistry, where the weight of each principle can be adjusted and varied for confident flexibility. The 12 principles are presented in a clockwise diagram where each sector is colored scaled from red to yellow to green representing the greenness of each principle in the method. The greener the diagram, the score tends to be near one [63\u201365].\nAn advanced tool for assessing how analytical processes affect the environment is the ComplexGAPI green assessment tool. It encompasses every facet of the process, including the synthesis and production of materials needed for the technique as well as sample collection, preparation, and analysis. The tool represents every phase of the process and how they impact on the environment employing a pictogram that consists of a\nhexagon and five pentagrams. To indicate a low, medium, or high effect, the pentagrams are colored green, yellow, or red, respectively. If specific conditions are satisfied, such having renewable or biodegradable materials used in the process, the hexagon is colored green. The tool is used for enhancing analytical chemistry\u2019s sustainability which can be used to track improvements over time and pinpoint places where more environmentally friendly analytical processes can be implemented [66, 67].\nOur aim to develop a new method to quantitively separate LEVA and TCBZ using RP-HPLC and TLC-Densitometry. The developed method aims to fulfil the ICH parameters requirements and to be green to maintain sustainability."

ACN were mixed with KH2PO4 buffer as a mobile phase in different ratios such as (60:40, 70:30, 80:20). The ratio (70:30) of ACN: KH2PO4 resulted in a better resolution. The flow rate was alternated to avoid tailing and fronting of the peak, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.5 mL/min were applied, and the optimized peaks were resulted from 1 mL/min. flow rate. For the selection of wavelength, wavelength maximum (\u03bbmax) of the spectra of both drugs were selected to carry on further measurement. The optimized chromatographic parameters were obtained by utilizing a combination of ACN and a 0.03 M KH2PO4 buffer in (70:30) ratio with flow rate (1 mL/min). The optimal separation was attained as shown in Figs.\u00a02\u20133.\nIn the TLC method, the optimization of mobile phase was performed by applying different ratios of methanol: dichloromethane (DCM); (90:10 and 80:20).
