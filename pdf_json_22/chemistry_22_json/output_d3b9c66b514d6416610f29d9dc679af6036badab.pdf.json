    "abstractText": "Transition metal-based compounds with high theoretical capacitance and low cost represent one class of promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. However, their low intrinsic electrical conductivity impedes their capacitive effect and further limits their practical application. Rational regulation of their composition and structure is, therefore, necessary to achieve a high electrode performance. Herein, a well-designed carbon-encased mixed-metal selenide rooted with carbon nanotubes (Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT) was derived from nickel\u2013cobalt bimetallic organic frameworks. Due to the unique porous structure, the synergistic effect of bimetal selenides and the in situ growth of carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibits good electrical conductivity, high structural stability and abundant redox active sites. Benefitting from these merits, the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT exhibited a high specific capacity of 554.1 C g\u22121 (1108.2 F g\u22121) at 1 A g\u22121 and a superior cycling performance, i.e., 96.4% of the initial capacity was retained after 5000 cycles at 10 A g\u22121. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor assembled with Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT cathode and activated carbon (AC) anode shows a superior energy density of 38.2 Wh kg\u22121 at 1602.1 W kg\u22121.",

            "text": "The growing consumption of traditional fossil fuels and the increasing requirement for the application of electric devices as well as large-scale energy storage stimulate researchers to pursue advanced and safe energy storage devices with both high energy and power density [1\u20134]. Among a variety of energy storage systems, supercapacitors (SCs) are representative due to high power density with the capability of fast charge and discharge process [5]. Generally, according to the difference in an energy storage mechanism, SCs can be mainly divided into electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. For the EDLCs, storage of electrical energy is realized via electrostatic interactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Additionally, pseudocapacitors originate from faradic reactions on/near the surfaces of electrode materials. As the critical part of SCs, electrode materials play a decisive role in the energy storage process and the cyclability of devices [6]. Transition metal selenides (TMS) are widely used in the research of electrode materials for fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors due to their redox activity [7]. Previous reports suggest that the electrochemical performance of single metallic selenide is not superior to bimetallic selenides due to the synergistic effects between bimetallic metal selenides, and the electronic structure and coupling interaction can be more probably adjusted [8\u201313]. Moreover, studies have shown that metallic selenides exhibit better electrochemical properties than their corresponding metallic oxides or sulfides due to their higher activities [13]. Therefore, bimetallic selenides are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. Nevertheless, the low conductivity and limited exposure of active sites\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7507. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27217507 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7507 2 of 15\nmake their electrochemical activity not efficient to display. The increment of utilization on the redox sites of two metal selenides through rational design of the structure is therefore of great significance towards promoted electrochemical performances. Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with periodic network structures formed by metal ions and organic linkers through coordination bonds [13\u201317]. Various MOF derivatives can be produced by simple heat treatment with their inherent porous structure well-retained, and the decomposition of organic linkers further generates more porous structures. Moreover, metal chalcogenides can be easily obtained by the corresponding oxidation/vulcanization/selenylation [17\u201319]. Carbon layers generated from the pyrolysis of organic linkers can work as structural support and promote electron transportation for the electrode materials [20]. In order to strengthen the electrical conductivity of the MOF derivatives, the introduction of secondary carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with excellent mechanical and electrical properties can be further suggested [21]. Moreover, originating from the structure of MOFs themselves, the metal centers such as Ni, Co and Fe are typical catalysts for in situ grow CNTs through chemical vapor deposition [22]. As compared to the simple compositing method to introduce CNTs, the in situ generation method can overcome the drawbacks such as uneven distribution and weak interaction between the active materials and carbon, playing better roles in promoting the performances of the electrodes. Herein, by using a Ni-Co bimetallic organic framework precursor (Ni-Co-BTC, BTC = 1,3,5-homo-tricarboxylic acid), we synthesized a well-designed carbon-encased mixed-metal selenide rooted with carbon nanotubes (Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT) via thermal treatment process together with in situ generations of CNTs followed by selenylation. CNTs are in situ grown on the selenide spheres during carbonization due to the catalytic role of Ni and Co-based catalysts, which are generated upon the reduction atmosphere at high temperatures. In addition to the carbon layers arising from the organic linkers in MOFs, the CNTs rooted in Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT further accelerate the electron/ion transport and improve the structural stability. The porous structure and mixed metal selenides donate more exposed active sites and facilitate the interfacial contact between the electrode materials and the electrolytes. Consequently, the as-prepared Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT exhibits a high specific capacity and superior cyclability. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor device assembled with Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT and activated carbon (AC) electrode shows high energy and power density."

            "text": "The preparation route of Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT is shown in Figure 1. The Ni-Co-BTC MOFs were obtained by coordinating nickel and cobalt ions with H3BTC using a hydrothermal method. Then, microsphere intermediates of carbon-supported Ni3C and Co3C rooted with carbon nanotubes were produced through an in situ chemical vapor process catalyzed by Ni and Co-based catalysts. Thereafter, the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT microspheres were obtained by a further step of selenylation. Figure S1a\u2013c show the SEM images of the Ni-BTC, CoBTC and Ni-Co-BTC MOF precursors, which display uniform spherical morphology with diameters from submicron to micron. XRD patterns exhibited in Figure S1d indicate that all three Ni/Co-BTC-based MOFs possess amorphous structures since no obvious diffraction peaks were observed. The FTIR spectrum of the three MOFs (Figure S2) shows similar absorption peaks, which are mainly arising from the organic ligand BTC. Specifically, the absorption peaks around 1560 cm\u22121, 1437 cm\u22121 and 1368 cm\u22121 correspond to the stretching vibrations of C=C in the benzene rings of BTC. Moreover, the absorption band around 1619 cm\u22121 can be assigned to the C=O bonds in Ni-BTC, Co-BTC, or Ni-Co-BTC MOF. This absorption signal underwent a redshift compared to the initial C=O bonds in H3BTC, proving the coordination interaction between the Co/Ni metal centers and BTC in the three as-synthesized MOFs [23,24]. Ni@C-CNT and Co@C-CNT intermediates were obtained after thermal treatments of Ni-BTC and Co-BTC MOF at 500 \u25e6C for 30 min.

Schematic illustration of the growth process of Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT.\nAccording to previous similar reports relevant to CNT growth catalyzed by Ni or\nCo-based catalysts (Ni, Co, their alloys or compounds such as carbides) using C2H2 as\ncarbon sources, the growth of CNT is assumed to experience three stages: induction\n(carburization), nucleation and growth following with the interaction between the Ni or\nCo-based catalysts and C2H2 [22,25]. Firstly, as indicated by the XRD patterns shown in\nFigure S4, metal carbides Ni3C and Co3C were generated in Ni-Co@C samples after py-\nrolysis of the Ni-Co MOF precursor. Nevertheless, Co and Ni nanoparticles may also be\nproduced and then undergo carburization followed by the decomposition of the carbon\nsource C2H2 gas [22]. After the formation of metal carbides, their surfaces prevent further\ncarbon diffusion and decompose by segregating part of the carbon dissolved. The seg-\nregated carbon atoms form the first graphene layer, initiating the formation of carbon\nnanostructure (nucleation). Then, it creates a concentration gradient of carbon in the cat-\nalyst that allows more C2H2 to be decomposed. Finally, the released carbon atoms as-\nsemble into the graphene layers and form the body of CNT (growth) [22]. The yield of\nCNT can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time and flow rate of the carrier gas, i.e.,\nAr gas, in this work, which helps transport the carbon source of C2H2 because they affect\nthe diffusion and deposition process of carbon atoms which are necessary to form CNT\n[26]. In the present work, a constant reaction time and flow rate of Ar/C2H2 gas were\nadopted, and we mainly investigated the performance difference of electrode materials\nwith or without the generation of CNT and did not further control the yield of CNT and\ntheir influence on the electrode performances. As suggested by previous reports, an op-\ntimal content of CNT may exist since the too-low content of CNT cannot provide suffi-\ncient conductive support to the electrode, while a too-high content of CNT inevitably\nreduces the energy storage capacity per weight [27\u201330].\nThe morphologies of Ni-Co@C and Ni-Co-Se@C are imaged in Figure S5.

After the formation of metal carbides, their surfaces prevent further carbon diffusion and decompose by segregating part of the carbon dissolved. The segregated carbon atoms form the first graphene layer, initiating the formation of carbon nanostructure (nucleation). Then, it creates a concentration gradient of carbon in the catalyst that allows more C2H2 to be decomposed. Finally, the released carbon atoms assemble into the graphene layers and form the body of CNT (growth) [22]. The yield of CNT can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time and flow rate of the carrier gas, i.e., Ar gas, in this work, which helps transport the carbon source of C2H2 because they affect the diffusion and deposition process of carbon atoms which are necessary to form CNT [26]. In the present work, a constant reaction time and flow rate of Ar/C2H2 gas were adopted, and we mainly investigated the performance difference of electrode materials with or without the generation of CNT and did not further control the yield of CNT and their influence on the electrode performances. As suggested by previous reports, an optimal content of CNT may exist since the too-low content of CNT cannot provide sufficient conductive support to the electrode, while a too-high content of CNT inevitably reduces the energy storage capacity per weight [27\u201330]. The morphologies of Ni-Co@C and Ni-Co-Se@C are imaged in Figure S5. SEM (Figure S5a) and TEM (Figure S5b) images show that the diameter of Ni-Co@C microspheres was reduced to about 500 nm. This is mainly caused by thermal decomposition at high temperatures [31]. It is worth noting that SEM (Figure S5c) and TEM (Figure S5d) images of Ni-Co-Se@C show a wrinkled and rough microsphere morphology, which may be caused by the further step of selenylation. Note that due to the formation of selenides NiSe2 and CoSe2, the integrity of the Ni-Co-Se@C is destroyed to some extent as compared to Ni-Co@C. This morphology change inevitably affects the electron/ion transportation of the electrode and, consequently, the electrochemical performance during cycling. Nevertheless, Ni-Co-Se@C still kept its spherical morphology and did not collapse completely, and the in situ formed carbon materials arising from the MOF precursors can also work as the\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7507 4 of 15\nstructural support for the system. The morphologies and nanostructure of the Ni-Co@CCNT are shown in Figure 2a. Small nanoparticles and CNTs were grown on the irregular microspheres, which are due to the decomposition of C2H2 catalyzed by nano-nickel and nano-cobalt-based catalysts (Figure 2a). TEM image (Figure 2b) shows more clearly that CNTs were grown on the particles. According to the SEM image (Figure 2c), the structure of Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT microspheres changed after selenization. It can be observed that the surfaces roughened and became grainy, indicating a decrease in the microsphere integrity. Nevertheless, the microspheres still kept their spherical morphology, which can also be identified by the TEM image shown in Figure 2d. Additionally, according to EDS mapping data (Figure 2e\u2013i), all the Ni, Co, Se and C elements in the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT microsphere were observed to distribute uniformly. Due to the low contrast of CNT as compared to the metal selenides in SEM images and the small size of CNT (~20 nm), they are not obviously identified from the SEM images in Figure 2c. However, TEM images clearly show the presence of tubular CNT, as shown in Figure 2d. In comparison, the Ni-Co-Se@C without generation of CNT did not show any tubular CNT on the surfaces (Figure S5d).\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 15\ncaused by the further step of selenylation.

Co-Se@C-CNT exhibited 190.6 C g\u22121 (381.2 F g\u22121) of capacity at 1 A g\u22121 but dramatically decayed at 10 A g\u22121, with 60.9% of capacity retention. NiCo-Se@C possessed 369.6 C g\u22121 (739.2 F g\u22121) of capacity at 1 A g\u22121 but slowly decayed at 10 A g\u22121, with only 77.7% of capacity retention. Remarkably, the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT electrode exhibited a high specific capacity of 554.1 C g\u22121 (1108.2 F g\u22121) at 1 A g\u22121 with a superior 89.9% of capacity retention at 10 A g\u22121. Table S2 presents a comparative electrochemical performance of the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT electrode with other previously reported bimetallic selenides. The superior specific capacity and better rate performance of the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT electrode may be related to its small transfer resistance caused by the in situ growth of CNTs rooted in the system as well as the carbon matrix inherited from the bimetal\u2013organic frameworks. Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 15\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7507 9 of 15\nIn order to better explore the reaction between electrode material and electrolyte at the interface, Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested. EIS plots and equivalent circuit models are shown in Figure 6c. Series resistance (Rs) was obtained from the intersection of the image and X axis; charge-transfer resistance (Rct) corresponds to the semicircle diameter in the high-frequency region; Warburg impendence (Zw) results from ions diffusion, which is related to the slope of the line during the low-frequency region. During the low-frequency region, the slope of the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT was significantly larger than that of Ni-Se@C-CNT, Co-Se@C-CNT and Ni-Co-Se@C, indicating a lower diffusive resistance. By comparing with their semicircle diameter in the high-frequency region, the Rs and Rct values of different samples were estimated, i.e., Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT (0.244 \u2126, 0.57 \u2126), Ni-Se@C-CNT (0.248 \u2126, 6.66 \u2126), Co-Se@C-CNT (0.218 \u2126, 1.88 \u2126) and Ni-Co-Se@C (0.253 \u2126, 2.44 \u2126). All samples exhibit similar Rs values, while the Ni-CoSe@C-CNT electrode (0.57 \u2126) showed the lowest charge transfer resistance, which may be due to the higher electrical conductivity of the in situ growth of CNTs and the mixed metal selenide particles. Together with its higher ID/IG value (Raman data), implying more defects to expose active sites and the mixed metal selenides that are assumed to provide abundant faradic sties compared to the single metal selenide, the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT electrode finally displays the best electrochemical performance. The long-term cyclability of Ni-Co\u2013Se@C-CNT was also investigated at 10 A g\u22121. Figure 6d and the inset figure indicate a capacity retention of about 96.4% after 5000 cycles, implying high structural stability of the Ni-Co\u2013Se@C-CNT electrode. Due to the superior electrochemical performance of the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT in the three-electrode system, an HSC device with Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT and AC, respectively, as the cathode and anode, was assembled in 6 M KOH. Figure 7a is a schematic diagram of the assembled hybrid supercapacitor. The electrochemical performance of AC is shown in Figure S7. The AC electrode exhibited a typical electric double-layer capacitance (Figure S7a). Meanwhile, the specific capacity of AC was calculated to be 87.7 C g\u22121 (175.3 F g\u22121) at 1 A g\u22121 based on a three-electrode system (Figure S7b). Figure 7b shows the CV profiles of the HSC device operated with varied potential windows at 20 mV s\u22121. An observable oxygen evolution peak appeared when the potential working window was scaled up to 1.6 V. Therefore, a potential range between 0 and 1.6 V was applied for the device. Figure 7c shows the CV curve of Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT//AC HSC at 10\u201350 mV s\u22121. The curve shape remains basically unchanged even at different scanning rates. The results show that the device has good stability in the charging and discharging process. GCD curves of HSC at 2\u201310 A g\u22121 are shown in Figure 7d. Capacities of 53.7, 46.7, 46.2, 44.4, 39.7, 31.2 C g\u22121 (respectively, corresponding to 107.3, 93.4, 92.3, 88.8, 79.2 and 63.1 F g\u22121) were calculated from the GCD curves (Figure 7e) at 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 A g\u22121, respectively. Notably, more than 58.8% of the original capacity was maintained even at a high current density of 10 A g\u22121. Figure 7f shows the Ragone plot of the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT//AC HSC device. Obviously, the fabricated Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT//AC HSC delivers a high energy density of 38.2 Wh kg\u22121 at a power density of 1602.1 W kg\u22121. The energy density still retains 22.4 W h kg\u22121 when the power density is up to 7987.3 W kg\u22121. The performance of our assembled device is superior to that of many recently reported devices such as C-20@(Ni, Co)0.85Se//AC [37], Ni0.67Co0.33Se2//AC [38], NiCoSe2//AC [39], Ni-Co-Se-2//AC [40], CuCo2Se4//AC [41] and NiCo2Se/MXene//AC [42]. These excellent electrochemical behaviors of the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT electrode and its application in the HSC device can be summarized on account of the following factors. Firstly, the Ni-Co mixed-metal selenides can supply more faradic reactions compared to single-metal selenides. Secondly, the final three-dimensional structures basically maintain the spherical morphology of the precursors to prevent their agglomeration during long-term cycling. Lastly, the encased carbon arising from the organic ligands and in situ growth of CNT further provide a stable platform for the active sites as well as for the fast charge transfer and electron transport.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7507 10 of 15\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15 behaviors of the Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT electrode and its application in the HSC device can be\nsummarized on account of the following factors.

            "text": "In summary, a bi-MOF-derived Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT electrode was constructed by a facile method. The mixed metal selenides supply more active sites for faradic reactions compared to single-metal selenides. The in situ growth of CNTs further increases the electrical conductivity, accelerates electron and ion transport and further improves the structural stability of the electrode material. The Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT shows a superior cycling performance, retaining 96.4% of initial capacity after 5000 cycles at 10 A g\u22121. When applied as a cathode in supercapacitors, the assembled Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT//AC HSC delivers a superior energy and power density of 38.2 Wh kg\u22121 and 1602.1 W kg\u22121, respectively. The superior electrode performance of Ni-Co-Se@C-CNT can be attributed to the synergic effect of the mixed metal selenides that provide abundant faradic reactions and the 3D carbon support that arises from the organic ligands of the bimetallic organic framework to offer a conductive matrix towards fast electron/ion transportation. Additionally, the in situ generations of the CNTs rooted in the Ni-Co-Se@C spheres further provide a stable and conductive platform for the active sites toward the high-energy storage process.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27217507/s1.
