            "text": "Yikang Zhang and Thomas Barthel Department of Physics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708, USA\n(Dated: August 1, 2022)\nWe study the steady states of translation-invariant open quantum many-body systems governed by Lindblad master equations, where the Hamiltonian is quadratic in the ladder operators, and the Lindblad operators are either linear or quadratic and Hermitian. These systems are called quasi-free and quadratic, respectively. We find that steady states of one-dimensional systems with finite-range interactions necessarily have exponentially decaying Green\u2019s functions. For the quasi-free case without quadratic Lindblad operators, we show that fermionic systems with finite-range interactions are non-critical for any number of spatial dimensions and provide bounds on the correlation lengths. Quasi-free bosonic systems can be critical in D > 1 dimensions. Lastly, we address the question of phase transitions in quadratic systems and find that, without symmetry constraints beyond invariance under single-particle basis and particle-hole transformations, all gapped Liouvillians belong to the same phase.\nIntroduction. \u2013 For closed systems, criticality and quantum phase transitions have been studied extensively [1\u20134]. Particularly, for one-dimensional systems, we have obtained a thorough classification of gapped states using the tensor-network ansatz [5\u20138].\nIn practice, most quantum systems are not perfectly isolated from their environment. In addition to posing challenges for quantum technology, driving and dissipation in open systems could be designed to stabilize (novel) phases of matter or particular entangled states [9\u201311], e.g., to facilitate measurement-based quantum computation [12, 13], quantum phase estimation [14, 15], and quantum simulation [16\u201320]. For Markovian systems, the density matrix \u03c1\u0302 evolves according to a Lindblad master equation [21\u201325]\n\u2202t\u03c1\u0302 = L\u03c1\u0302 = \u2212i[H\u0302, \u03c1\u0302] + \u2211 \u03b1 ( L\u0302\u03b1\u03c1\u0302L\u0302 \u2020 \u03b1 \u2212 1 2 {L\u0302\u2020\u03b1L\u0302\u03b1, \u03c1\u0302} ) .\nIn addition to the Hamiltonian part \u2212i[H\u0302, \u03c1\u0302], the Liouvillian superoperator L captures decoherence processes with environment couplings described by the Lindblad operators L\u0302\u03b1.\nIn this work, we elucidate the occurrence of criticality and phase transitions in the steady states of open quasi-free and quadratic systems of fermions and bosons. Quasi-free open systems are characterized by Hamiltonians that are bilinear and Lindblad operators that are linear in ladder operators. Quadratic open systems may have additional bilinear self-adjoint Lindblad operators [26, 27]. A system is called critical if it has a unique steady state with algebraically decaying correlations. We establish that quadratic one-dimensional (1D) systems with finite-range interactions and unique steady states necessarily have exponentially decaying Green\u2019s functions. Next, we address quasi-free systems with finiterange interactions. Quasi-free fermionic systems are noncritical for any number of spatial dimensions [28]. Conversely, one can construct critical quasi-free bosonic systems for D \u2265 2 dimensions. Gapped quasi-free systems\nare always non-critical. Of course, the existence of critical steady states does not necessarily imply phase transitions. In fact we show that, without symmetry constraints beyond invariance under single-particle basis and particle-hole transformations, all gapped Liouvillians of quadratic open systems belong to the same phase.\nExperimentally, systems of trapped ions [29, 30], Rydberg atoms [31, 32], ultracold atoms in optical lattices or tweezers [33\u201335], and superconducting circuits [36, 37] allow for the engineering of such dissipative systems [38\u2013 43]. In circuit QED systems [44\u201347], linear Lindblad operators arise naturally from photon loss and pump process, while the coupling of cavities can lead to bilinear Lindblad operators [48, 49]. Setup and covariance matrix. \u2013 Consider a system\nof identical bosons or fermions with ladder operators a\u0302j and a\u0302\u2020j for modes j = 1, . . . , N . We employ Majorana operators w\u0302j+ := (a\u0302j+ a\u0302 \u2020 j)/ \u221a 2 and w\u0302j\u2212 := i(a\u0302j\u2212 a\u0302\u2020j)/ \u221a\n2 which obey the (anti-)commutation relations\n{w\u0302i\u00b5, w\u0302j\u03bd} = \u03b4i,j\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd for fermions, and [w\u0302i\u00b5, w\u0302j\u03bd ] = \u2212i\u00b5 \u03b4i,j\u03b4\u00b5,\u2212\u03bd for bosons.\nWe address Markovian systems with quadratic Hamiltonians H\u0302 = \u2211 i\u00b5,j\u03bd w\u0302i\u00b5Hi\u00b5,j\u03bdw\u0302j\u03bd . Quasi-free systems only have linear Lindblad operators L\u0302s =\u2211 j\u03bd Ls,j\u03bdw\u0302j\u03bd . Quadratic systems may feature additional bilinear self-adjoint Lindblad operators M\u0302u = M\u0302\u2020u =\u2211 i\u00b5,j\u03bd w\u0302i\u00b5(Mu)i\u00b5,j\u03bdw\u0302j\u03bd . The 2N\u00d72N covariance matrix\n\u0393i\u00b5,j\u03bd := { i 2 \u3008w\u0302i\u00b5w\u0302j\u03bd \u2212 w\u0302j\u03bdw\u0302i\u00b5\u3009 for fermions, 1 2 \u3008w\u0302i\u00b5w\u0302j\u03bd + w\u0302j\u03bdw\u0302i\u00b5\u3009 for bosons\n(1)\ncan be shown to evolve according to the equation of motion [26, 27]\n\u2202t\u0393 = X\u0393 + \u0393X T + Y + \u2211 u Zu\u0393Z T u , (2)\nwhere the real 2N \u00d7 2N matrices X, Y , and Zu depend on the coupling coefficients H, Ls, and Mu as detailed\n2 in the Supplemental Material. The Zu term vanishes for quasi-free systems.\nFor a translation-invariant system in D dimensions, each mode i is associated with a cell location i \u2208 ZD and a crystal-basis index ci = 1, . . . , b, where b is the number of bands. The covariance matrix elements and coupling coefficients are then functions of spatial distances such that\n\u0393i\u00b5,j\u03bd =: \u03b3ci\u00b5,cj\u03bd(i\u2212 j), Xi\u00b5,j\u03bd =: xci\u00b5,cj\u03bd(i\u2212 j)\netc., and the equation of motion (2) takes the form\n\u2202t\u03b3(r) = \u2211 n [ x(n)\u03b3(r \u2212 n) + \u03b3(r + n)xT (n) ] + y(r)\n+ \u2211 u,n,j,l zu(r \u2212 n, j \u2212 n)\u03b3(r \u2212 l)zTu (\u2212n, l\u2212 n), (3)\nwhere \u03b3, x, y, and zu are 2b\u00d7 2b matrices depending on lattice translation vectors r \u2208 ZD. Correlations in quadratic 1D systems. \u2013 As a first\nresult, let us establish the following.\nProposition 1. If a quadratic 1D system with translation-invariant finite-range couplings has a unique steady state, then its single-particle Green\u2019s function \u03b3(r) cannot follow a power-law decay with respect to the distance |r|.\nFor the steady-state covariance matrix \u03b3(r), the righthand side of Eq. (3) needs to be zero. For distances r large enough such that the local zu and y terms vanish, \u03b3(r) obeys a matrix difference equation of the form\nC0\u03b3(r) + C1\u03b3(r + 1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ CR\u03b3(r +R) = 0. (4)\nHere \u03b3(r) is the vectorization of \u03b3(r), the 4b2 \u00d7 4b2 matrices Cm are determined by the coupling matrices x(m), and R denotes the interaction range [50].\nIn the simplest scenario, CR is invertible such that we can solve Eq. (4) for \u03b3(r +R) and\ngr+1 =  AR\u22121 AR\u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A1 A0 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 ... ... . . . ... ...\n0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 0\n gr (5)\nwith gTr := (\u03b3T (r + R \u2212 1), . . . ,\u03b3T (r)) and Am := \u2212C\u22121R Cm. The spectrum of the 4b2R\u00d74b2R transfer matrix in Eq. (5) characterizes the spatial decay of \u03b3(r). As the spectrum is discrete, all elements of \u03b3(r) must decay exponentially, converge to a constant, or oscillate with constant amplitude. An algebraic decay that characterizes critical systems is not possible. The transfer matrix may have eigenvalues \u03b2 with |\u03b2| > 1. These are however irrelevant as physical systems cannot feature indefinitely\ngrowing \u03b3(r). For fermions, this is also prohibited by the constraint that all covariance matrix elements lie in the interval [\u22121/2, 1/2] [26]. The Supplemental Material [50] gives a more general proof based on generating functions, which does not require invertibility of CR. Criticality in quasi-free systems. \u2013 Stronger re-\nsults hold for the systems that have no quadratic Lindblad operators and, hence, no Zu term in Eq. (2). Let us first consider gapped systems, where the Liouvillian L has a single zero eigenvalue and the other eigenvalues \u03bb have a nonzero dissipative gap \u2206 := \u2212max\u03bb6=0 Re\u03bb > 0.\nProposition 2. Gapped quasi-free systems with translation-invariant finite-range couplings are never critical.\nNote that, using quasi-locality [51], this proposition can be generalized to interacting systems. But quasifree systems allow for a more direct proof that provides bounds on correlation lengths to be reused for Prop. 3:\nDue to translation invariance, we can transform to a momentum-space representation with quasi-momenta ka = 2\u03c0 L , 4\u03c0 L , . . . , 2\u03c0 for a = 1, . . . , D. With\n\u03b3\u0303(k) := \u2211 r e\u2212ik\u00b7r\u03b3(r), x\u0303(k) := \u2211 r e\u2212ik\u00b7rx(r) (6)\nand an analogous definition of y\u0303, according to Eq. (3), the steady state obeys the continuous Lyapunov equation\nx\u0303(k)\u03b3\u0303(k) + \u03b3\u0303(k)x\u0303T (\u2212k) = \u2212y\u0303(k). (7)\nFor a quasi-free system to be gapped, all eigenvalues of X in Eq. (2) or, equivalently, all eigenvalues of x\u0303(k) \u2200k in Eq. (7) need to have negative real-parts [26]. But this means that we can solve Eq. (7) for \u03b3\u0303(k) by inverting the matrix x\u0303(k)\u2297 1 + 1\u2297 x\u0303(\u2212k). Due to the finite interaction range, x\u0303(k) and y\u0303(k) are polynomials in variables za := e\nika \u2208 C and 1/za. Hence, \u03b3\u0303(k) is a rational function of the za which, according to the invertibility of x\u0303(k), has no poles on the manifold |za| = 1 that corresponds to real momenta ka \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0] in the Brillouin zone. For concreteness, let us discuss D = 2 dimensions; the generalization to D 6= 2 is trivial. The established property of \u03b3\u0303(k) =: \u03b3\u0303(z1, z2) allows us to determine \u03b3(r1, r2) using Cauchy\u2019s residue theorem from complex analysis:\nIn the thermodynamic limit, the inverse of Eq. (6) is\n\u03b3(r1, r2) = \u2212 {\n|z1|=|z2|=1\nd2z\n(2\u03c0)2 zr1\u221211 z r2\u22121 2 \u03b3\u0303(z1, z2). (8)\nFor fixed z2, let %(z2) := i \u2211 m Res ( \u03b3\u0303(\u03b6m(z2), z2) ) denote the sum over the residues of \u03b3\u0303 at pole locations z1 = \u03b6m(z2) inside the unit circle |z1| = 1 [52]. With |\u03b6| := maxm,|z2|=1 |\u03b6m(z2)| < 1, it follows that\n|\u03b3(r1, r2)| \u2264 |\u03b6|r1\u22121 \u222e |z2|=1 dz2 2\u03c0 \u2223\u2223zr2\u221212 %(z2)\u2223\u2223 . (9)\n3 As the contour integral is independent of r1, this bound establishes an exponential decay of \u03b3(r1, r2) with correlation length\n\u03be1 \u2264 \u22121/ ln |\u03b6| = \u22121 / max m,|z2|=1 ln |\u03b6m(z2)| (10)\nin the positive r1 direction. An exponential bound for negative r1 is obtained by using z1 := e\u2212ik1 instead of eik1 , and the same arguments apply to r2 or further dimensions.\nThe steady states of quasi-free systems are Gaussian [26]. Hence, according to Wick\u2019s theorem [53, 54], the steady state is fully characterized by \u03b3(r), and the exponential decay of \u03b3(r) implies the exponential decay of all connected real-space correlation functions which concludes the proof of Prop. 2. Let us now drop the constraint of a nonzero dissipative gap.\nProposition 3. Quasi-free fermionic systems with translation-invariant finite-range couplings are never critical.\nFor a unique steady state, the momentum-space covariance matrix \u03b3\u0303(k) solving Eq. (7) is again a rational function. Furthermore, it cannot have poles at real k for any short-range fermionic system [28]: The covariance matrix \u0393 in Eq. (1) is real and anti-symmetric. Hence, there exists an orthogonal transformation O \u2208 O(2N) such that \u0393\u2032 := O\u0393OT = ( \u03c7 \u2212\u03c7 ) , where the elements \u03c7i of the N \u00d7 N diagonal matrix \u03c7 correspond to the imaginary eigenvalue pairs \u00b1i\u03c7i. The transformation defines an alternative set of Majorana operators w\u0302\u2032i\u00b5 := \u2211 j\u03bd Oi\u00b5,j\u03bdw\u0302j\u03bd with covariance matrix \u0393\n\u2032 such that \u03c7i = i\u3008w\u0302\u2032i+w\u0302\u2032i\u2212\u3009. As each fermionic occupation number operator a\u0302\u2020j a\u0302j has eigenvalues 0 and 1, the operators iw\u0302j+w\u0302j\u2212 = 1/2 \u2212 a\u0302\u2020j a\u0302j and the operators iw\u0302\u2032i+w\u0302\u2032i\u2212 have eigenvalues \u00b11/2. Thus, all \u03c7i are in the interval [\u22121/2, 1/2], and all covariance matrix elements obey |\u0393i,j | \u2264 \u2016OT\u0393\u2032O\u2016 = \u2016\u03c7\u2295 (\u2212\u03c7)\u2016 \u2264 12 . The Fourier transform (6) to momentum space just adds another unitary transformation. Hence, the elements of \u03b3\u0303(k) have modulus \u2264 1/2, i.e., singularities can only occur at complex momenta. Their imaginary parts provide bounds on correlation lengths as in Eq. (10), and the system is not critical.\nProposition 3 is in stark contrast to closed fermionic systems, where tight-binding models have, for example, critical Fermi-sea ground states. The situation for open bosonic systems is different. Note that bosonic open systems can be unstable in the sense that the Liouvillian can have eigenvalues with positive real-parts that lead to unlimited absorption of energy and particles. In quasi-free systems, however, the existence of a steady state implies stability [26]. So, stability is implied in the following.\nProposition 4. Quasi-free bosonic systems with translation-invariant finite-range couplings can be critical in D \u2265 2 dimensions. 1D systems cannot be critical.\nThe statement on 1D systems follows immediately from Prop. 1 and Wick\u2019s theorem. Furthermore, one can construct quasi-free bosonic models that are critical for D \u2265 2 dimensions. Specifically, consider a purely dissipative model with one Lindblad operator L\u0302 (1) j := \u221a 2D\u03b7(w\u0302j+ \u2212 iw\u0302j\u2212) = \u221a 2D\u03b7 a\u0302j for every site j \u2208 ZD of the D-dimensional square lattice as well as four Lindblad operators L\u0302(2\u00b1)j,a := w\u0302j+ + iw\u0302(j\u00b1ea)\u2212 and L\u0302 (3\u00b1) j,a := w\u0302j+ \u00b1 w\u0302(j\u00b1ea)\u2212 for every edge, where ea are the unit vectors for directions a = 1, . . . , D. One finds that x\u0303(k) = 2D (ck \u2212 \u03b7)12, where ck := \u2211 a cos ka/D [50]. The largest X eigenvalue real-part determines the dissipative gap \u2206 [26]. Here, x\u0303(k) has the doubly degenerate eigenvalue \u03be(k) = 2D (ck \u2212 \u03b7) and, hence, \u2206 = \u2212maxk Re \u03be(k) = 2D (\u03b7 \u2212 1). So the model is stable for loss rates \u03b7 \u2265 1 and the gap closes for \u03b7 = 1 at momentum k = 0. Solving the Lyapunov equation (7) yields the covariance matrix \u03b3\u0303(k) with the diagonal and off-diagonal elements\n\u03b3\u0303\u00b1,\u00b1(k) = \u03b7 + 2\n2(\u03b7 \u2212 ck) and \u03b3\u0303\u00b1,\u2213(k) = \u00b1isk 2(\u03b7 \u2212 ck) , (11)\nwhere sk := \u2211 a sin ka/D. With a Fourier transform to \u03b3(r), one can assess criticality. For D = 1 dimensions, the Fourier integral can be evaluated exactly using the residue theorem. In agreement with Props. 1 and 2, we find an exponential decay of correlations if \u03b7 > 1. The correlation length diverges for \u03b7 \u2192 1, but there is no power-law decay. For dimensions D \u2265 2, one can expand \u03b3\u0303(k) in a multipole series over hyperspherical harmonics [55] to reduce the Fourier transformation to a radial integral, which takes the form of a Hankel transform. The leading contributions to \u03b3\u0303\u00b1,\u00b1 are isotropic while those to \u03b3\u0303\u00b1,\u2213 are anti-symmetric with respect to reflection. For D = 2 dimensions, the diagonal correlations \u03b3\u00b1,\u00b1(r) decay logarithmically in |r| and the off-diagonal \u03b3\u00b1,\u2213(r) decay as 1/|r|. For D = 3, they decay as 1/|r| and 1/|r|2, respectively. A detailed discussion is given in the Supplemental Material. Phase classification for quadratic systems. \u2013\nLike quantum phase transitions in closed systems [1\u2013 3], driven-dissipative phase transitions are characterized by a non-analytic dependence of steady-state expectation values on system parameters. This requires a nonanalytic change in the steady-state density matrix and, hence, a level crossing [56]. So, the dissipative gap \u2206 needs to close at the transition point [57, 58]. As seen so far, there are some restrictions on criticality in quadratic open systems, but the gap can of course close. As another fundamental result, we will see why, here, closing the gap does generally not lead to phase transitions.\nProposition 5. For quadratic systems without symmetry constraints beyond invariance under single-particle basis transformations and fermionic particle-hole symmetry, all gapped systems belong to the same phase. For any\n4 pair of gapped systems L1 and L2, one can construct a continuous path of gapped Liouvillians that links the two.\nIn particular, we claim that for any quadratic Liouvillian L with gap \u2206, the auxiliary Liouvillian\nL+ \u03baD has a gap \u2206\u2032 \u2265 \u2206 + \u03ba. (12)\nFor fermionic systems, the added dissipator D comprises two linear Lindblad operators L\u0302i\u00b1 = w\u0302i\u00b1 for every mode i [59]. For bosons, D comprises one operator L\u0302i = w\u0302i+\u2212 iw\u0302i\u2212 = \u221a 2 a\u0302i per mode. With this choice and any \u03ba0 > 0, the gap stays nonzero, e.g., along the path (1 \u2212 g)L1 + gL2 + \u03baD, where the parameters are tuned as (g, \u03ba) : (0, 0) \u2192 (0, \u03ba0) \u2192 (1, \u03ba0) \u2192 (1, 0) to connect L1 to L2. Note that this proposition does not require short-range interactions.\nStatement (12) can be proven by employing the thirdquantization formalism [26, 60\u201362] as detailed in the companion paper [26]: (a) There exist ladder superoperators aj\u03bd and a\u2032j\u03bd that obey canonical (anti-)commutation relations and form a basis for the superoperator algebra. (b) One can then construct a biorthogonal operator basis\n\u3008\u3008n| and |n\u3009\u3009 with \u3008\u3008n|n\u2032\u3009\u3009 = \u03b4n,n\u2032 , (13)\noccupation numbers nT = (n1+, . . . , nN+, . . . , nN\u2212), and a\u2032j\u03bdaj\u03bd |n\u3009\u3009 = nj\u03bd |n\u3009\u3009. The Dirac notation with superbras \u3008\u3008A\u0302| and super-kets |B\u0302\u3009\u3009, where A\u0302 and B\u0302 are operators on the Hilbert space, is based on the HilbertSchmidt inner product \u3008\u3008A\u0302|B\u0302\u3009\u3009 \u2261 Tr(A\u0302\u2020B\u0302). (c) The ladder superoperators can be chosen such that the matrix representation \u3008\u3008n|L|n\u2032\u3009\u3009 of L assumes a block-triangular form when ordering the basis (13) according to increasing eigenvalues Na \u2208 N of the number superoperator Na := \u2211 j\u03bd a \u2032 j\u03bdaj\u03bd . The spectra of the blocks L|Na on the diagonal determine the full Liouvillian spectrum [63]. The only terms due to D that affect the blocks L|Na are [26]\n\u2212 a\u2032T B+B \u2217 2 a, \u2212a T B+B\u2217 2 a \u2032, a\u2032TU\u2020\u03c4 B\u2212B \u2217 2 Ua (14)\nfor fermions with even Na, fermions with odd Na, and bosons, respectively. In Eq. (14), aT = (a1+, . . . , aN\u2212) and a\u2032T = (a\u20321+, . . . , a\u2032N\u2212) are vectors containing all ladder superoperators, U is a unitary matrix, \u03c4 =(\n0 \u2212i1N i1N 0 ) , and Bi\u00b5,j\u03bd = \u2211 s Ls,i\u00b5L \u2217 s,j\u03bd is a positivesemidefinite matrix, characterized by the expansion coefficients of linear Lindblad operators L\u0302s = \u2211 j\u03bd Ls,j\u03bdw\u0302j\u03bd .\nFor fermions, the Lindblad operators of dissipator D have coefficients Li\u00b1,j\u03bd = \u03b4i,j\u03b4\u00b1,\u03bd and, hence, B = 12N such that the first two terms in Eq. (14) are simply \u2212Na and Na \u2212 2N , respectively. This implies that the spectrum of block L|Na is shifted by \u2212Na\u03ba and (Na \u2212 2N)\u03ba for even and odd Na, respectively. As the Na = 0 block that contains the steady-state eigenvalue zero is one-dimensional, the spectral shifts due to \u03baD necessarily increase the gap to \u2206\u2032 \u2265 \u2206 + \u03ba. For bosons, we have\n10\u221214 10\u221212 10\u221210 10\u22128 10\u22126 10\u22124 10\u22122\n5 10 15 20 25\n|\u03b3+,+|\nr\n\u03b6 = 1/4\n\u03b6 = 0\n\u03c6\n\u2206+ \u03ba \u2206\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n0 1 2 \u03c0 \u03c0 3 2 \u03c0\nFIG. 1. The open fermionic model (15) with \u03b7 = 1 and \u00b5 = 0. Left: Both, in the quasi-free case (\u03b6 = 0) and quadratic case (\u03b6 = 1/4) with \u03b1 = 1/5 and \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/5, correlations decay exponentially, where the asymptotic form \u223c \u03b2r (dashed lines) is determined by an eigenvalue \u03b2 of the transfer matrix in Eq. (5). Right: The dissipative gap \u2206 for \u03b6 = 0 and \u03b1 = 1/2 vanishes at \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0. It can be increased using the additional dissipator \u03baD from Eq. (12).\nLi,j+ = \u03b4i,j and Li,j\u2212 = \u2212i\u03b4i,j . Hence, B = (\n1N i1N \u2212i1N 1N ) and \u03c4(B \u2212 B\u2217)/2 = \u221212N such that the third term in Eq. (14) reads \u2212Na. Thus, also in the bosonic case, the gap increases at least by \u03ba. For quasi-free fermionic and bosonic systems, the gap increases exactly by \u03ba, i.e., \u2206\u2032 = \u2206 + \u03ba. Dissipator D is invariant under singleparticle basis transformations a\u0302j \u2194 \u2211 i Uj,ia\u0302i and also under particle-hole transformations a\u0302j \u2194 a\u0302\u2020j for fermions. This completes the proof of Prop. 5. Example. \u2013 To illustrate some of the above results,\nconsider the quadratic fermionic 1D model with Hamiltonian\nH\u0302 = \u2211 j ( a\u0302\u2020j a\u0302j+1 + \u03b1a\u0302 \u2020 j a\u0302 \u2020 j+1 +H.c. ) \u2212 \u00b5 \u2211 j a\u0302\u2020j a\u0302j , (15)\ncorresponding to a spin-1/2 XY chain, and Lindblad operators L\u0302j = \u221a \u03b7 ( w\u0302j+ + e i\u03c6w\u0302(j+1)+ ) as well as M\u0302j =\u221a\n\u03b6 ( 2a\u0302\u2020j a\u0302j \u2212 1 ) . In accordance with Prop. 1, \u03b3(r) is always found to decay as \u03b2r for an eigenvalue \u03b2 of the transfer matrix in Eq. (5). Proposition 3 implies that the quasi-free model (\u03b6 = 0), considered in Ref. [64], is never critical, and x\u0303(k) determines the full many-body spectrum [26]. In particular, if the Hamiltonian is gapped and \u03b7 > 0, the dissipative gap \u2206 closes only at \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c0. The correlation length diverges at those points (\u03b2 \u2192 1) but, at the same time, \u03b3(r) \u2192 0 for all r. Furthermore, employing the additional dissipator \u03baD from Eq. (12), any two gapped points can always be connected by a path of gapped Liouvillians as explained by Prop. 5 and illustrated in Fig. 1 for the points \u03c6 = \u03c0/4 and \u03c6 = 9\u03c0/4. So, the system is neither critical at \u03c6 = 0 or \u03c0, nor does it undergo phase transitions. Details are presented in the Supplemental Material. Discussion. \u2013 We have found fundamental prereq-\nuisites for criticality and phase transitions in drivendissipative many-body systems that are in stark contrast to properties of closed systems. For any number\n5 of spatial dimensions, there exist fermionic and bosonic closed systems with phase transitions and critical ground states, i.e., states featuring an algebraic decay of spatial correlations, even if the systems are quasi-free. In contrast, steady states of open 1D quasi-free systems as well as higher-dimensional quasi-free fermionic systems are never critical. For quadratic systems, we found that, while the dissipative gap may close and the system might even be critical for certain points in parameter space, all steady states basically belong to the same phase. The only way for realizing phase transitions in such systems is to impose symmetries on the considered Liouvillians that go beyond invariance under singleparticle basis transformations (e.g., lattice symmetries) and fermionic particle-hole transformations or combinations thereof. A notable example are topological transitions in quasi-free systems, occurring under the (strong) restriction that the Lindblad operators from a complete anti-commuting set [65, 66]. The observation that dissipative phase transitions are, in the above sense, more rare than phase transitions in closed systems adds to the idea that steady states are in certain scenarios related to thermal states of closed systems [10, 67\u201369] such that continuous symmetries cannot be broken inD \u2264 2 dimensions according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem [70, 71]. Interactions and more complex Lindblad operators can break the block-triangular Liouvillian structures [26, 63] that underlie our results on quasi-free and quadratic systems and can cause true phase transitions [68, 72\u201376] as long as we are below an upper critical dimension where all systems become effectively quasi-free.\nWe gratefully acknowledge discussions with Enej Ilievski, Israel Klich, Jianfeng Lu, and Toma\u017e Prosen as well as support through US Department of Energy grant DE-SC0019449.\n[1] S.
