    "abstractText": "Adulteration of food products is a widespread problem of great concern to society and dairy products are no exception to this. Due to new methods of adulteration being devised in order to circumvent existing detection methods, new detection methods must be developed to counter fraud. Bovine hard cheeses such as Asiago, Parmesan, and Romano are widely sold and consumed in pre-grated form for convenience. Due to being processed products, there is ample opportunity for the introduction of inexpensive adulterants and as such, there is concern regarding the authenticity of these products. An analytical method was developed using a simple organic extraction to verify the authenticity of bovine hard cheese products by examining the lipid profile of these cheeses via proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In this study, 52 samples of pre-grated hard cheese were analyzed as a market survey and a significant number of these samples were found to be adulterated with vegetable oils. This method is well suited to high throughput analysis of these products and relies on ratiometrics of the lipids in the samples themselves. Genuine cheeses were found to have a very consistent lipid profile from sample to sample, improving the power of this approach to detect vegetable oil adulteration. The method is purely ratiometric with no need for internal or external references, reducing sample preparation time and reducing the potential for the introduction of error.",

            "text": "Bovine hard cheeses are a widely consumed dairy product throughout much of the world and pre-grated products made from these cheeses are popular as a condiment for many foods. The majority of these products are composed of grated cheese with small amounts of antimycotic preservatives such as potassium sorbate, which was used in many samples in this study. Anti-caking agents such as cellulose powder are also used in most samples tested. Some grated cheeses with no additives are also encountered. Adulteration of these cheese products has previously been discovered involving the addition of cellulose powder as a filler at levels far beyond those sufficient to prevent caking [1]. Food adulteration leads to a product that is cheaper and is sold as the original product. This results in consumers buying a product that is not what they expected and is often inferior to the unadulterated version. Due to the nature of this product\u2019s manufacture and its typical use as a garnish on other foods, it would seem a prime candidate for adulteration with a low chance of discovery by the consumer. NMR analysis of food products is a powerful tool for the detection of adulteration. It is ideal for analyses of this type due to high sample throughput, the ability to discriminate based on structural differences of metabolites with similar masses, and the ability to examine samples in either their native state or with little sample preparation. Despite these abilities, NMR does not appear to have previously been applied to detecting the adulteration of cheese with vegetable oils.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 920. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28030920 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 920 2 of 11\nNMR simplifies the analysis of structural features in analytes, and this becomes a very powerful tool to detect food fraud. While structural information can be inferred from chromatography retention times or tandem mass spectrometry, it is inherent to NMR experiments. It is particularly valuable when identifying lipids in edible oils or cheese. For example, both \u03b1-linolenic acid and \u03b3-linolenic acid are 18-carbon, triply unsaturated fatty acids found in edible oils with identical molecular weights of 278.436 Da. Via LC-MS these fatty acids would only vary by retention time assuming adequate separation in the chromatography step. Tandem mass spectrometry can also be used to differentiate these, but this involves a separate experiment. However, as \u03b1-linolenic acid is an\u03c9-3 fatty acid with an unsaturated bond located three carbons from the terminal methyl group, its methyl group displays a distinct triplet proton resonance at approximately 0.97 ppm, where the \u03c9-6 \u03b3-linolenic\u2019s methyl signal is closer to 0.85 ppm [2]. This allows for much easier quantification of \u03c9-3 fatty acids with NMR and speeds the determination of a sample\u2019s lipid profile. Additionally, this structural information is invaluable when comparing levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, total numbers of unsaturated bonds, and \u03c9-3 fatty acid levels present in a sample. While not an exhaustive analysis of the sample\u2019s composition, it is often sufficient to determine the authenticity of said sample. The simplicity of NMR sample preparation is a natural complement to its inherent speed of analysis. Simple dilution or liquid extractions are much less labor intensive than some sample preparation regimens required for other methods. Significant improvements in laboratory throughput can be achieved by eliminating the need for steps such as derivatization for gas chromatography of non-volatile compounds, hydrolysis of triacylglycerols for analysis of lipids in mass spectrometry, and with the additional benefit of reducing the opportunity for sample contamination or errors. This also has the benefit of analyzing samples in their native or near-native state without chemical modification. Analysis of cheese via NMR has been performed for quite some time. However, previous works were typically focused on aqueous extracts in order to determine point of origin [3,4], or a combination of origination and the process of cheese ripening [5]. 1H NMR-based lipid profiling of cheese has been performed before, however, this approach involved a lengthy soxhlet extraction step making it less appealing for routine screening of samples, and the study did not address adulteration [5]. The spectral differences between the lipid profiles of genuine cheese and imitation cheese prepared from vegetable oil was demonstrated previously but this method was also not applied to the detection of adulterated products in a market survey [6]. Mass spectrometry has also been used to profile the lipids in cheese but was similarly not used as an approach for detecting adulteration [7]. The aim of this study was to create and test a method for the analysis of hard cheese products with the aim of detecting vegetable oil adulterants. The method was designed to be rapid in order to facilitate its use in high-throughput situations. The difference in lipid profiles between cheese and vegetable oils makes the detection of adulterated cheeses relatively straightforward with a simple ratiometric analysis."

Most oils yielded lipid profiles inconsistent with the adulterated cheese samples, but palm oil yielded a lipid profile nearly identical to sample 3. The results are detailed in Table 2. Comparing the other samples suspected of adulteration to intentionally adulterated cheese spectra shows that all of the suspicious samples appear to be adulterated with palm oil to varying degrees. A further study was conducted in order to more conveniently estimate the rate of palm oil adulteration in suspected samples using a calibration curve using integral ratios. Quantification of the level of palm oil adulteration in these samples was accomplished by generating calibration curves of two peak ratios. This allows for a convenient and more precise estimation of the amount of palm oil in the sample versus the amount of actual cheese. It does not take into account the insoluble anti-caking agents present in all adulterated samples studied and, therefore, is not a measurement of the total w/w adulteration rate. Despite this limitation, the calculation does yield important information as to the degree of palm oil adulteration in these samples. Baseline sample B1 was used to make samples adulterated with palm oil in the range of 10 to 90 percent by weight. All samples were extracted and analyzed as described previously. The ratios of the intentionally adulterated cheese were calculated and plotted to generate a calibration curve allowing an estimation of the degree of palm oil adulteration versus cheese in each sample (Figure 7). The functions for each curve followed an exponential regression. The equation for \u03c9-3 vs. remaining methyl peak was found to be F(x) = 108.9584 \u00d7 10\u221229.7812x. For the\u03c9-3 vs. glycerol ratio, the equation was F(x) = \u2212112.0973 \u00d7 10\u22123.3871x. The correlation coefficients for these curves are values of 0.989 and 0.983 respectively. These calibration curves were used to calculate the approximate amounts of palm oil added to each sample relative to cheese with no accounting for any additional binders. The calculated values were found to be similar to the values determined by overlaying spectra of market survey samples with spectra of serially adulterated samples (Table 3). While this does not yield an exact determination of the level of adulteration, it does serve to calculate a general estimate of palm oil adulteration levels in these products.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 920 8 of 11\nTable 3.

Of these baseline samples, three were Parmesan, two were Romano, and one was Asiago. To gain a broader understanding of cheese lipid profiles, one sample of Mimolette, one sample of Piave cheese, and one sample each of ungrated and pre-grated mozzarella were also analyzed. All market survey grated hard cheese samples were obtained from retailers, restaurants, and public school cafeteria kitchens. All samples were composed of Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, and combinations thereof. All samples are detailed in Table 4.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 920 9 of 11\nMolecules 2023, 28, 920 10 of 11\nCanola, grapeseed, peanut, olive, high oleic sunflower, high oleic safflower, high linolenic safflower, soybean, and palm oils were purchased from local and online retailers and used as received."

            "text": "This study revealed a previously undiscovered method of adulterating pre-grated bovine hard cheeses for economic purposes. Palm oil itself is a clever adulterant owing to\nMolecules 2023, 28, 920 11 of 11\nits semi-solid state at room temperature, similar color to cheese, and low price compared to cheese. Presumably, these adulterated products contain higher than normal levels of cellulose or other binders in order to maintain the appearance of the product. However, this study is strictly limited to the lipid profile of these products, and no attempts were made to quantify any fillers aside from palm oil. In this study, 29% of all samples tested were certainly adulterated with palm oil. That combined with nearly half of the adulterated samples possessing lipid fractions composed of greater than 50% palm oil shows a rather brazen attitude in this industry regarding the commission of fraud through the adulteration of these products. The 52 samples tested are by no means an exhaustive survey of all pre-grated hard cheeses sold, however, it does reveal a new frontier in food adulteration. The method described herein will make the detection of this new type of food adulteration straightforward and aid in combating the problem.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28030920/s1, Table S1: Raw integral values of cheese spectra for all samples; Table S2: Cheese integral ratios for all samples.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.L.R., J.A.G., C.M.G.; methodology, C.L.R.; formal analysis, C.L.R., C.M.G.; data collection and curation, C.L.R., M.P.B., J.P.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, C.L.R.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.L.R., J.A.G., M.P.B., J.P., C.M.G.; project administration, C.M.G.
