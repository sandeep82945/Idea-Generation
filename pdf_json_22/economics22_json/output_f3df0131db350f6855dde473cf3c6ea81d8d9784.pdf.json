    "abstractText": "The question of whether communicable or non-communicable diseases have higher economic effects on households is rarely explored from the global to local level despite of their significant contribution in increasing household catastrophic spending and impoverishment. To shed light into this, therefore, this paper comparatively examines the economic effects of communicable and non-communicable diseases in Tanzania by the use of Tanzania Panel Survey data of 2019/2020 which has been used to analyze different parameters to provide needful information. The empirical analysis employed probit, twostage residual inclusion (2SRI), and control function approachf (CFA) helpful in controlling endogeneity issues. Findings showed that, comparatively, non-communicable diseases have higher economic effects in endangering households into catastrophic spending and impoverishment comparing to communicable diseases. Conclusively, neglecting developing countries to fights against multiplicative effects of these diseases alone will result in killing their economies since most of these countries depend on donors and household as a means of healthcare financing. However, this paper recommends for global initiatives in reducing the burden of disease by funding on palliative care costs and enhancing the availability of affordable health insurance schemes to reduce household economic burden.",

            "text": "Several research studies have been conducted on communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) to examine the burden of these diseases on household income at the national and global level, but few scholarly works look at both at the same time and compare their consequences on catastrophic expenditure and deprivation (Kazibwe et\u00a0al., 2021; Bhuyan, 2019;\u00a0Wamai et\u00a0al., 2018).\nMoreover, communicable diseases have been the leading causative of death globally, but suddenly due to the major medical improvement, innovations, and changes in the way of life, NCDs have overtaken communicable diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality. The complexity of NCDs has been higher than communicable diseases because most NCDs are directly linked with daily human lifestyles,\nunlike most communicable diseases (Andrew, 2019; Young, 2015).\u00a0However, NCDs being dangerous killer diseases worldwide today do not mean that malaria, HIV/AIDS, diarrhea, and other recent pandemic diseases like COVID-19 are not severely affecting the universe population but are just well managed due to the improved medical innovations.\nStatistically, in 2019, the major top ten causes of death accounted for 55% of entire 55.4 million deaths worldwide with the leading causative on the total number of lives lost being cardiovascular, respiratory infections, neonatal conditions, and other birth complications, while tuberculosis has been one of the world\u2019s worst infectious illnesses, inflicting around 1.2 million fatalities per year. Other deadliest infectious diseases are cholera, malaria, HIV/AIDS, measles, and hepatitis C (Andrew, 2019; WHO, 2020).\nAdditionally, 71% of the 56.9 million death cases reported globally in 2016 were due to communicable diseases mainly from cancer, heart disease, and diabetes as well as chronic respiratory diseases. These statistics justify that NCDs have surpassed even the most killer diseases like HIV and Malaria. Astonishingly, about 66% of the reported deaths * Felician Andrew Kitole felicianandrew@gmail.com\n1 Department of\u00a0Economics, Mzumbe University, P.O. Box\u00a05, Morogoro, Tanzania\n1 3\ndue to NCDs were from middle- and lower-income countries (Andrew, 2019; Mariara et\u00a0al., 2018; Wamai et\u00a0al., 2018).\nAfrica has the highest prevalence of communicable diseases in the world. In 2015, more than three times as many people died from AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than ten times as many people died from malaria as in the rest of the world combined. However, a World Bank report claims that by 2030, non-communicable diseases are expected to cause more deaths in Africa than communicable diseases of which for every 100 deaths, 70 will be due to NCDs (WHO, 2020; Narayan & Donnenfeld, 2016).\nMoreover, between 50 and 88% of deaths in seven African countries, mostly small island nations, are due to noncommunicable diseases (WHO, 2022).\u00a0In addition to that, in seven other countries\u2014majority of them being Africa\u2019s most populous\u2014the diseases claimed between 100,000 and 450,000 lives annually. The WHO reports 2022 indicates that the growing burden of non-communicable diseases has posed a grave threat to the health and lives of millions of people in Africa as more than a third of deaths in the region are due to these illnesses.\nDespite of the rising burden of the NCDs, yet communicable diseases have significant share of burden among African countries. As indicated in Fig.\u00a01, major communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and diarrheal in total contribute large number of share of deaths among African countries in 2022. Nowhere is this contrast more striking than in sub-Saharan Africa, where communicable, maternal, nutritional, and newborn diseases continue to dominate. The dramatic progress has been made in reducing the loss of life from many types of communicable diseases and conditions of early childhood, especially diarrheal diseases and lower respiratory infections.\nIn 2016, more than one billion people in sub-Saharan countries, including Tanzania, were affected by CVDs. The disease is accounting for 38.3% of all NCDs deaths, 11.3% of deaths from all causes in the region, and 5.5% of the global CVD-related deaths. Cardiovascular-related diseases\nare expected to double in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by 2020 if there will be no implementation of preventive measures (Andrew, 2019).\nOn the other hand, Tanzania as one of the African countries in the sub-Saharan regions is not exempted from the burden that has been caused by these diseases. According to recent estimates, approximately 33% of all Tanzanian population is affected by NCDs, mainly being due to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases4as it has been presented at Table\u00a01.\nAdditionally, the rate of mortality due to these diseases is highly unacceptable despite having an unequal share in causing the number of deaths and increasing the burden on household income (Chen et\u00a0al., 2018).\u00a0Although the major burden due to these diseases at the household level has been the loss of the family members and debts incurred by households to treat the sick family members, at the national level, however, burdens are experienced through increased country\u2019s health economic costs. Nonetheless, the burden at the household level is always coupled when such households are hit with other nutritious deficiencies and maternal problems which are dominant across low- and middle-income nations (Ritchie & Roser, 2018).\nBurdens are severe at the household level when households are spending more of its disposable income on treating"

Over 60% of Tanzania healthcare facilities are run by the government with the rest being either faith-based or private. As the country Tanzania is progressing towards universal healthcare, in 2020/2021, the government allocated $387.9 million for the health sector of which $155.5 million were spent on development projects (ITA, 2021).\u00a0Additionally, high proportions of Tanzania\u2019s health financing (Fig.\u00a02) are financed by foreign donors, despite of the decline in the household contribution, yet for a decade now, households have been highly financing health sector in the country through out-of-pocket (OOP) payments more than the government share of expenditure on it.\nAdministratively, Tanzania has a hierarchical health system which is in tandem with the political-administrative hierarchy (Andrew, 2019).\u00a0At the bottom, there are the dispensaries found in every village where the village leaders have a direct influence on its running. The health centers are found at ward level and the health center in charge is answerable to the ward leaders. At the district, there is a district hospital and at the regional level a regional referral hospital. The tertiary level is usually the zone hospitals, and at a national level, there is the national hospital. There are also some specialized hospitals that do not fit directly into this hierarchy and therefore are directly linked to the ministry of health.\nDespite bigger burden enthroned on the shoulders of household on healthcare financing in Tanzania, yet a modest proportion of the population are enrolled in social, community, or private health insurance. Health insurance coverage is still low with only 32% of Tanzanians as of 2019 covered by health insurance. Of that number, only 1% are members of private health insurance."

            "text": "Communicable and non-communicable diseases have a substantial influence on family income and productivity, which is mostly caused by a loss in the labor force owing to death, absenteeism, and even an increase in the number of workers retiring early (Xu et\u00a0al., 2003).\u00a0On the other hand, households are forced to spend a lot of money and cut household income due to high treatment costs coupled with the inability to smooth consumption. Another important effect is on the depletion of lifetime expectations and increased social rate of time preferences.\nUltimately, these increase household dependency ratio, diminishing productivity of labor, lowering household financial resilient, and increasing total household spending as well lowering household capability for the investments in physical capital. Despite these burdens that cut across all households globally, yet severe burdens are experienced in developing countries where health financing systems are not well established and hence deepening poverty (Andrew, 2019; Young, 2015).\nMoreover, spending on health is growing faster than the rest of the global economy, accounting for 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP). The WHO reveals that there is a swift upward trajectory of global health spending, which is particularly noticeable in low- and middle-income countries where health spending is growing on average 6% annually compared with 4% in high-income countries. On the other hand, governments provide an average of 51% of a country\u2019s health spending, while more than 35% of health spending per country comes from out-of-pocket expenses.\n1 3\nOne consequence of this is 100 million people pushed into extreme poverty each year (Andrew, 2019; WHO, 2019).\nIn cementing these intuitions, literatures report that an average of 2 to 10% of households globally is facing catastrophic healthcare spending with the projections that the situation is worser in developing countries especially in African countries where majority of the world poor population lives (Marshall et\u00a0al., 2022; Narayan & Donnenfeld, 2016).\nThis burden threats economic growth in the continent through diversion of resources to healthcare and this cut across all levels from the household to national level. Diseases erode a household\u2019s income and diminish the future productivity of the patients. Moreover, through lowering households\u2019 incomes, and spending power and production capacity, diseases therefore slow down economic growth.\nFor example, a health life lost estimate by the WHO shows that more than 630 million years have been lost in the Africa region alone with more than 2.4 trillion US dollars being wasted for controlling diseases in 2017 (Andrew, 2019; Wamai et\u00a0al., 2018).\u00a0Diseases drain productivity and increase inefficiencies (WHO, 2020), and in sub-Saharan Africa alone, more than 21 million productive years have been lost due to diseases (Kagaruki et\u00a0al., 2015; Gaziano, 2005).\nOn the other hand, due to effects of these diseases, health systems in Africa have been challenged by insufficient number of human resources for health, medications, and other medical equipment, of which the final bearer of the burden has always been households. For instance, the cost for treating severe NCDs in Tanzania reached US$ 100 million in 2005 and are projected to reach US$ 500 million in 2025 of which this is expected to deplete more than US$ 2.5 billion in 2025 billion, whereas the burden is always experienced heavily at the household level (Andrew, 2019; Mwai & Muriithi, 2015).\nResearches show that households have been selling off their belongings especially the most valuable family or personal assets to acquire money to meet requirements for medical treatment and other healthcare costs and this creates loopholes for the consumption of the accumulated capital. In a long run, capital consumption increases households\u2019 implications on the ability for these households to pay for healthcare as well as the other consumable goods for health which later cracks the household\u2019s level of productivity and incomes (Andrew, 2019; Kyobutungi et\u00a0al., 2008; Mwai & Muriithi, 2015),\u00a0hence weakening households\u2019 ability to accumulate wealth by wiping out savings and other durable resources, and thus households become prone to poverty through catastrophic spending and excessive out-of-pocket spending on healthcare service.\nCatastrophic health expenditure is a real challenge among household in most developing countries including Tanzania\nthat needs to be well addressed as it has been highly used as a means of healthcare financing despite its effects in increasing inequity in healthcare provision. Tanzania recorded a low share of healthcare expenditure of 7.2% of the country\u2019s GDP (Andrew, 2019)\u00a0characterized by lower public spending on health at 39% (Andrew, 2019; WHO, 2020).\u00a0According to Tanzania\u2019s Ministry of Health, catastrophic health expenditure accounts for 52% of entire health spending, with the remainder split between private and public payment systems (Andrew, 2019).\nAlthough catastrophic healthcare payments occur in both rich and poor countries, but more than 90% of the people affected resides in low-income countries. Catastrophic health expenditure can occur regardless of the amount of money paid to healthcare services. Rich households might pay large medical bills without experiencing negative implications, while low levels of spending among poor households can have severe financial implications for livelihoods (Chuma & Maina, 2012).\nVarious studies have assessed impacts of catastrophic spending on household poverty. These studies, largely conducted in Asia and Latin America, show that healthcare costs are major causes of impoverishment. In their study on health expenditures in 11 Asian countries, they reported that poverty estimates were 14% higher when OOP payments are accounted for and that about 78 million people are pushed into poverty due to healthcare costs (van Doorslaer et\u00a0al., 2006).\u00a0Elsewhere, a survey of 89 countries found that catastrophic expenditure was reported by 3%, 1.8%, and 0.6% of households in low-, middle-, and high-income countries respectively (Xu et\u00a0al., 2007).\u00a0Few studies have documented the levels of catastrophic health expenditures in Africa. In Burkina Faso, about 15% of households reporting illness incurred costs greater than 40% of their non-food consumption expenditure (Su et\u00a0al., 2006), while in Uganda, 2.9% of households incurred catastrophic expenditure in 2003 (Xu et\u00a0al., 2006).\u00a0In Nigeria, 40.2% of households incurred costs greater than 10% of their consumption expenditure; this proportion reduced to 14.8% when the threshold was set at 40% (Onoka et\u00a0al., 2011).\u00a0The poorest households were more likely to incur catastrophic expenditures compared to households.\nThe major limitation of the few studies conducted in Africa is that they do not assess the implications of healthcare costs on catastrophic spending and impoverishment (Chuma & Maina, 2012;\u00a0Mwai & Muriithi, 2015;\u00a0Bhuyan, 2019).\u00a0Assessing the role of healthcare payments on poverty is important for informing policy on the need to incorporate health financing designs in poverty reduction programs and for highlighting the urgent need to ensure that health financing systems offer financial risk protection. This paper contributes to the literature by comparatively assessing the extent of catastrophic health spending and\n1 3\nimpoverishment in Tanzania due to communicable and non-communicable diseases.\nSpecifically, this study provides a wake-up call findings for African countries towards the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 and African Agenda 2063 in reducing disease burden among households and achieving general target of ensuring health lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."

Total household income Y is therefore the sum of incomes earned by each household members (labor income liwi and non-labor income yj ), as well as the income received by household members jointly, yj\u00a0(Mwai & Muriithi, 2015).\nTherefore, the household with members i \u2208 [1, 2\u2026\u2026 ..n] is facing utility maximization problem that:\nHowever, the utility-maximizing Eq.\u00a0(1) is thereafter subjected to the household income Eq.\u00a0(2) which states that:\nAdditionally, the income generated by labor liwi comprises of the salaries and wages, while the non-labor income denoted by yj consists of dividends, interest, remittances, and other household\u2019s financial returns. Assuming income is a pooled and individual members in a household have identical preferences, the generic response to the expressed utility maximization problem will result in the household consumption function in terms of prices, p , total household income Y , and household characteristics, h , as presented in Eq.\u00a0(3):\nTherefore, due to the limitations of the unitary model (Chiappori, 1992; Apps & Rees,\u00a0 1997),\u00a0 the collective household models have been developed with the assumption that the individual member of the household has a utility of U\u223ci = u\u0303i(c1, c2 \u2026\u2026 cn, h) , whereas cs(s = 1, 2\u2026 .n)\n(1)Max U = u\u0303(c, h)\n(2)Y = n \u2211\ni=1\nliwi +\nn \u2211\ni=1\nyi + yj\n(3)c1 = f (p,Y , h)\nand h symbolize the consumption function of an individual and the characteristics of the household simultaneously.

(2010)\u00a0and Andrew (2019)\u00a0in estimating the contribution of non-communicable diseases to catastrophic expenditure. Catastrophic spending normally occurs when expenditure on health surpasses a household\u2019s ability to pay. In this study, the ability to pay is classified when a household consumption spending less combined survival income for all household members.\nTherefore, the catastrophic expenditure is expressed as:\nwhere Mj is the ratio of household healthcare expenditures to its total consumption minus all household members\u2019 combined survival income. The Mj greater than 30% signifies catastrophic spending. The numerator thj reflects household expenditure j , while the denominator Tcj indicates total household consumption, n is the size of the household, and p is the poverty threshold.\nAdditionally, this paper also examined the probability at which CDs and NCDs influence households to fall under catastrophic expenditure which has been obtained by estimating Eq. (7). A household insurance acquisition has been estimated in the model to assess whether the insured household has an impact or any significant change in lowering the probability for the occurrence of catastrophic spending\n(4) MaxW = W[u\u0303i\n( c1, c2 \u2026 , cn, h ) \u2026 , u\u0303n ( u\u0303i ( c1, c2 \u2026 , cn, h )]\n(5)MaxW = W [ u\u03031 \u2026 , u\u0303n ]\n(6)Mj = thj\nTcj \u2212 njp\n1 3\nin the presence of diseases (CDs or NCDs). The model for household catastrophic spending due to NCDs is conveyed as:\nwhereby a dummy variable Csj assumes the value of 1 for households that incurred the catastrophic spending, while another dummy variable ncdj shows the presence of an NCD; on the other hand, the dummy insj is a categorical variable showing whether a household has purchased or obtained health insurance, hj represents a vector of household characteristics, and , , and are the parameters to be estimated, while vj is the stochastic parameter. Additionally, the possible endogeneity may arise during estimating Eq. (7) because the presence of NCDs is also caused by other exogenous factors of which without suppressing, it will lead to estimation bias (\u201cEndogeneity and Heterogeneity\u201d section).\nMoreover, this study examines the fact whether household spending on non-communicable diseases impoverishes households in Tanzania of which the relationship of the aforementioned fact can be established through the following set of equations.\nFrom the above equations, Tpc sj , Tsj , and T npc sj represent the per capita household spending, gross household spending, and net per capita spending of the household simultaneously, and also hj and nj are the health spending and household size respectively. The household health expenditure will be considered to be an impoverishing factor if the gross per capita spending of the household exceeds the poverty line for that particular household, while the net per capita spending of the household is also less than the household poverty level of the given expenditure.\nTo estimate the household impoverishment as the result of NCDs, Eq. (8) is estimated of which the health insurance variables are also included as an important institution parameter that can reduce the household possibility for impoverishment. Additionally estimating Eq. (8) without controlling endogeneity can also make results inconsistent and bias; hence, controlling it is necessary (\u201cEndogeneity and Heterogeneity\u201d section);\nFrom the above equation, Isj is a dummy variable that explains whether a household is experiencing an impoverishment; ncdij is also a dummy variable that shows catastrophic\n(7)Csj = 0 + incdj + insj + jhj + vj\n(8)Tpcsj = Tsj\nnj\n(9)Tnpcsj = Tsj \u2212 hj\nnj\n(10)Isj = 0 + 1ncdj + insj + Ijhj + j\nspending (as used herein in the report that is above the cutting point of 30%) as a result of NCDs in a household, while the dummy for insurance is insj and hj represents the household characteristics. 0 , , and 1 are the obtained parameters that have to be estimated, while j is a stochastic term."

Normally, endogeneity occurs when there is a correlation between variables of interest and the error term (Table\u00a02). In estimation for the catastrophic and impoverishment models, the likelihood of health inputs being correlated with the stochastic term is high. Therefore, failure to adjust and control this problem of endogeneity will make the parameter estimates to be biased and inconsistent.\nHowever, in relaxing these challenges, instrumental variable (IV) and the two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) have been applied. 2SRI is the best technique for controlling endogeneity in both linear and non-linear models (Andrew, 2019).\u00a02SRI involves two procedures of which at first, it involves the calculation of residuals to a reduced form from the estimated functions and inserting those residuals as added explanatory variables in the second-stage regression. Generally, the control function approach is an extension of the two-stage residuals with null hypothesis tests of the exogeneity and more often is known as the new stage reduced equation which helps to control both endogeneity and heterogeneity (Andrew, 2019; Mariara et\u00a0al., 2018).\nThe instrument used in suppressing this endogeneity arose during estimating Eqs. (5) and (8) is the distance to healthcare facility of which Eqs. (5) and (8) were found to be exactly identified. On the other hand, since CDs, NCDs, impoverishment, and catastrophic spending are binary outcome variables, the probit model has been used in hypothesizing the underlying latent variable. The main advantage with this method is its linearity effect of regressors with latent variables ranging from minus infinity to plus infinity ( \u2212\u221e to +\u221e) while the observed values being 0 or 1 (Andrew, 2019).\nTesting Validity of\u00a0Instruments\nEstablishing an appropriate instrument in explaining the structural equation is one of the key challenges for controlling endogeneity when using the IV technique. Therefore, the best instruments are noticed by assessing the validity of that instrument and its strength. The decision for checking for validity helps to understand whether instruments possess three characteristics of a good instrument as identified by scholars\u00a0(Andrew, 2019; Mwai & Muriithi, 2015; Mariara et\u00a0al., 2018; O'Donnell et\u00a0al., 2005)\u00a0that good instruments are those with a high degree of correlation to the endogenous variable while having no causal direct effects on outcome measures, and exogenous in the model specification; when all these characteristics are observed, the instrument is therefore strong and valid whose justification is based on the first-stage regression F statistic and eigenvalue statistic tests as shown in Tables\u00a03 and\u00a04.\nThe decision criteria on the first-stage F statistic result on Table\u00a03 are based on the ability of the partial R-squared to explain the variations of explanatory variable on the explained variable. Therefore, the partial R-squared is greater and significant and then the instrument is considered not weak. Moreover, Table\u00a04 explains that, since none of the\ncritical values are larger than the minimum eigenvalue statistic, then the null hypothesis that instrument used is weak is rejected and concluding that instrument is strong and satisfies the three conditions of good instrument."

These findings are contrary to those made in Bangladesh (Bhuyan, 2019)\u00a0and Kenya (Mwai & Muriithi, 2015).\nOn the other hand, findings reveal that an increase in household size lowers the likelihood of developing catastrophic spending by 2.77%. However, these findings are inconsistent with the study conducted in Asia which argued that households with large household sizes have higher chances of having large sick members and hence facing catastrophic spending (O'Donnell et\u00a0al., 2005).\u00a0The effects are more severe to households that have no health insurance or any other form of waivers as this study has found that having health insurance reduces chances for the households falling into catastrophic spending by 53.926% compared to those households that have no health insurance.
