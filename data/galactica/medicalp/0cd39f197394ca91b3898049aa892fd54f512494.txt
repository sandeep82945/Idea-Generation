conclusion In overall, the prevalence of poor sleep quality was alarming in medical students with some participants reporting using medication to fall asleep. Most medical students had less than recommended hours of sleep and their habitual sleep efficiency was the most impaired. However, final-year and first-year students experienced the poorest sleep quality compared to other classes. A large number of medical students suffer from mild to severe daytime dysfunctions. Despite overall poor sleep quality, we found lesser use of medications to fall asleep. Based on these findings, intervention methods such as sleep education, behavioural changes, and relaxation techniques are suggested to address the factors that contribute to poor sleep quality. To address this sleep issue, it is also critical that health promotion policies and strategies, particularly those focusing on healthy sleep hygiene, can be implemented. Though factors linked to modern technologies like the use of social media or more time spent on screens are globally known as the main factors leading to poor sleep quality among medical students11,49, future studies should consider psychosocial, and environmental factors that contribute to poor sleep quality among medical students, as well as conduct a prospective study to determine the cause-effect relationship of risk factors for poor sleep quality.
