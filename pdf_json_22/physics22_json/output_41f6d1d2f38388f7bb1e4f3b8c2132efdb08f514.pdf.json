    "abstractText": "A three-dimensional finite element analysis model of surface acoustic wave (SAW) torque sensor based on multilayer structure is proposed in this paper. Compared with the traditional saw torque sensor with quartz as piezoelectric substrate, the SAW torque sensor with multilayer structure has the advantages of fast propagation speed and high characteristic frequency. It is a very promising torque sensor, but there is very little related research. In order to successfully develop the sensor, it is essential to understand the propagation characteristics and torque sensing mode of SAW in multilayer structure. Therefore, in this study, we first established a multi-layered finite element analysis model of SAW device based on IDT/128\u25e6 Y-X lithium niobate/diamond/Si (100). Then, the effects of different film thicknesses on the characteristic frequency, electromechanical coupling coefficient, s parameter, and mechanical quality factor of SAW device without changing the wavelength are analyzed. Then, based on the finite element analysis, a three-dimensional research model of a new SAW torque sensor suitable for small diameter torsion bar (d = 10 mm) is established, and the relationship between saw device deformation and torque under the condition of small torque (\u00b140 Nm) is tested. The shape variable is introduced into the finite element analysis model of multi-layer SAW device. Finally, the relationship between saw torque sensor with multi-layer structure and torque is established by using the deformation relationship, which shows the perfect curve of sensor performance.",

Introduction\nAmong the emerging torque measurement principles and methods, torque measurement technology based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) principles has become one of the most attractive research topic directions due to its potential advantages. First, SAW propagates along a solid surface, and its propagation velocity is four to five orders of magnitude lower than that of an electromagnetic wave, which is convenient for the introduction or extraction of signals at any point in the propagation. Second, SAW devices are usually fabricated with the semiconductor planar process, which is especially suitable for mass production. Third, SAW devices have stable performances, high reliability, and good repeatability. Low sensitivity to external environmental factors can be achieved by optimizing the cutting shape of piezoelectric materials. At present, SAW devices have been widely used as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, chemistry sensors, acceleration sensors, biology, and torque sensors [1\u20139]. According to the reported SAW torque sensor data [10\u201318], most of these sensors use quartz as a piezoelectric substrate material, and the characteristic frequency is around 433 MHz. Low-temperature sensitivity can be achieved by using the specific cut shape of the piezoelectric body. However, with the rapid development of the fifth generation (5G) technology, low and medium frequency SAW devices will not meet the needs of the market.

The research on high-frequency SAW devices generally starts based on one of two aspects. Either a finer and more reliable interdigital transducer (IDT) finger strip from the structure is pursued, or higher basic sound velocity from the material is pursued [19\u201327]. However, the thinner IDT finger is often accompanied by more stringent manufacturing technology and means, which leads to a sharp increase in cost. Moreover, the ability of interdigital fingers that are too fine to resist high-frequency vibrations will decrease, and the high temperature generated by the high-frequency mechanical vibration can easily cause the melting of interdigital fingers. Therefore, due to the conditions of existing manufacturing technology and equipment, a higher basis for sound velocity-based materials or new piezoelectric structures, which are the main methods for improving the operating frequency and performance of SAW devices, should be identified because they are the only feasible way forward at this stage. A three-dimensional finite element analysis model of SAW torque sensor with multilayer structure is proposed in this paper. The sensor model is based on the characteristics of small shaft diameter and low resonance frequency of existing SAW torque sensors. The structure of small SAW torque sensor with elastic torsion shaft is studied by finite element method. The effects of different film thicknesses on the characteristic frequency, electromechanical coupling coefficient, s parameter, and mechanical quality factor of the sensor are analyzed.

Simulation Model 3.1. Modeling a High Frequency SAW Resonator with a Layered Structure\nThe traditional SAW resonator is composed of piezoelectric substrate, interdigital transducer, reflective grating, and sound absorption strip. When the wavelength of incident wave is the same as that of reflected wave, SAW propagates in the form of standing wave between transducer and grating. The frequency of standing wave is the characteristic frequency of SAW device. The working principle of multi-layer SAW resonator is the same\nSensors 2022, 22, 2600 4 of 14\nas that of traditional SAW resonator, but the difference lies in the structure of the device. The multi-layer SAW resonator does not use piezoelectric single crystal as the piezoelectric substrate, but uses a variety of piezoelectric thin film materials, even non-piezoelectric thin film materials superimposed to form a piezoelectric substrate. In recent years, SAW devices with multi-layer structure have been widely concerned and studied. This is because the advantages and characteristics of different materials can be displayed by selecting different materials to form layered media. This is not only conducive to improving the performance of SAW devices, reducing the size of devices and reducing the cost, but can also develop new devices and sensors and broaden the application Field and scope. For example, a piezoelectric film may be coated on a nonpiezoelectric material having a high sound velocity to increase the sound velocity of the device. The electromechanical coupling coefficient of the device can be improved by covering the material with high electromechanical coupling coefficient on the surface of the material with low electromechanical coupling coefficient. The device with zero temperature coefficient can be obtained by covering the material with negative temperature coefficient with positive temperature coefficient piezoelectric film. However, the multi-layer structure greatly increases the complexity of SAW device performance calculation, but also reduces the accuracy. The finite element method (FEM) can improve the simulation accuracy and reduce the calculation time. In this study, COMSOL multiphysics 5.6 finite element analysis software is used for simulation research. The 2D pattern of SAW resonator for simulation is shown in Figure 3. The initial values of the material and structure dimensions of each layer in the X3 direction were as follows: perfectly matched layer (pml), a silicon substrate (matrix layer), diamond film layer (growth layer), LiNbO3 film layer (piezoelectric layer), and aluminum electrode (interdigital transducer). See Tables 1\u20135 for material parameters, structural parameters, boundary conditions, and electrode polarity of all materials.

Conclusions In this work, we propose a multi-layer structure simulation model of high frequency SAW torque sensor and carry out detailed simulation research in two main aspects. Firstly, for the multi-layer structure of IDT/128\u00b0 Y-X lithium niobate/diamond/Si (100), the effects of working wavelength, LiNbO3 film thickness, and diamond film thickness on the resonant frequency, phase velocity, electromechanical coupling coefficient, s parameter, and mechanical quality factor of SAW resonator are analyzed. The simulation results show that the resonant frequency of the resonator increases with the decrease in the working wavelength. When the working wavelength is 4 \u03bcm, the maximum value of the electromechanical coupling coefficient appears at the wavelength of 0.3 times of LiNbO3 film thickness and 0.1 times of diamond film thickness. The maximum value is 0.105. Under the condition of initial structural parameters, the S parameter of multilayer SAW resonator is \u221220.5 dB and the quality factor mQ is 8370. With the increase in the thickness of LiNbO3 film, the SAW propagation in the layered structure is more similar to that in the LiNbO3 single crystal. On the contrary, with the decrease in the thickness of the LiNbO3 film, the SAW propagates more in the diamond film, and the SAW transmission in the layered structure is more similar to that in the LiNbO3 single crystal.

Conclusions\nIn this work, we propose a multi-layer structure simulation model of high frequency SAW torque sensor and carry out detailed simulation research in two main aspects. Firstly, for the multi-layer structure of IDT/128\u25e6 Y-X lithium niobate/diamond/Si (100), the effects of working wavelength, LiNbO3 film thickness, and diamond film thickness on the resonant frequency, phase velocity, electromechanical coupling coefficient, s parameter, and mechanical quality factor of SAW resonator are analyzed. The simulation results show that the resonant frequency of the resonator increases with the decrease in the working wavelength. When the working wavelength is 4 \u00b5m, the maximum value of the electromechanical coupling coefficient appears at he wavelength of 0.3 times of LiNbO3 film thickness and 0.1 times of diamond film thickness. The maximum value is 0.105. Under the condition of initial str ctural parameters, the S paramet r of ultilayer SAW resonator is \u221220.5 dB and the quality factor Qm is 8370. With the increase in the thickness of LiNbO3 film, the SAW propagation in the layered structure is more similar to that in the LiNbO3 single crystal. On the contrary, with the decrease in the thickness of the LiNbO3 film, the SAW propagates more in the diamond film, and the SAW transmission in the layered structure is more similar to that in the LiNbO3 single crystal. Besides, the electromechanical coupling coefficient of SAW resonator increases with the decrease in the thickness of LiNbO3 film and diamond film. Secondly, aiming at the problem that the diameter of the elastic torsion shaft is too small, a new SAW torque sensor structure is studied, and the torque measurement principle under the new structure is analyzed. The simulation results show that the new saw torque sensor reduces the surface shear stress by 17% under the same torque, and the strain linearity of SAW resonator is good in the range of \u221240~40 Nm torque measurement. Finally, the relationship between the applied torque and the output frequency is analyzed, and the unconventional frequency output curve is obtained. The linearity is very good, which fully proves the high frequency SAW of layered structure; a good working performance of the torque sensor. The research of this method is not limited to this, but can also be expanded, such as whet er other thin-film materials or other layered structures can be used to achieve better SAW propagation characteristics; the influence of external conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and vibration, on the performance of saw torque sensor with a layered structure. In future work and research, the authors will make a sample of high frequency SAW torque sensor with the layered structure to demonstrate the method proposed in this work, and compare the performance of the high frequency saw torque sensor with the traditional saw torque sensor more clearly.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2600 13 of 14\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.L. and X.M.; methodology, Z.L. and X.M.; software, X.M.; validation, Z.L., X.M., and C.Z.; formal analysis, B.W.; investigation, X.M.; resources, B.W.; data curation, X.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, X.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, Z.L.; supervision, Z.L.; project administration, Z.L.; funding acquisition, Z.L.
