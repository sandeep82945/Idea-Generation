    "abstractText": "Introduction: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable, and treatable disease. The first PREM (patient-reported outcome measure)-type questionnaire that has been dedicated to assess the experience of care in COPD is the PREM-C9. Aim: The aim of this study was to create a Polish version of the PREM-C9 and determine its psychometric characteristics. Methods: The validation procedure involved forward and back translation. We included 42 patients with COPD. The psychometric properties were assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha, Bartlett\u2019s test, the Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin test, and Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient. The validity of the questionnaire was assessed using a principal component analysis for the extracted principal components. The validity of the factor analysis was demonstrated using Bartlett\u2019s sphericity test and the Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013 Olkin (KMO) test. A factor analysis was performed using the Oblimin and Varimax rotation. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Results: The Polish version of the analyzed questionnaire met all the validation criteria: face, translation, psychometric, functional, and reconstruction equivalence. Spearman\u2019s correlation results between the Polish PREM-C9 and CAT were as follows: rho = 0.44, p = 0.003539; HADS-Anxiety: rho = 0.370864, p = 0.015612; and HADS-Depression: rho = 0.387405, p = 0.011253. Conclusions: The developed Polish PREM-C9 questionnaire is a reliable and valid tool that assesses Polish COPD patients\u2019 experiences of their disease and the care they receive.",

According to the latest GOLD report, COPD is \u201ca heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction\u201d [1]. The causes and risk factors of COPD have been recently described with the GETomic acronym, which stands for dynamic, cumulative, and repeated gene (G)\u2013environment (E) interactions over a person\u2019s lifetime (T) that damage their lungs or change their normal ageing processes [2]. The most important environmental\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 2746. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11202746 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 2746 2 of 12\nrisk factor is cigarette smoking, but this group also includes occupational exposure [3] and air pollution [4]. Commonly, assessments of the clinical effectiveness of interventions use well-defined endpoints. According to the guidelines of the Polish Agency for Health Technology Assessment, these are endpoints related to mortality, morbidity (related to the course/exacerbation of the disease), the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), unwanted events, and adverse effects (divided into severe and other) [5]. However, the same guideline underlines that endpoints relevant from the patient\u2019s perspective should also be considered. These endpoints include patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs). The patient\u2019s perspective is paramount. Principle 5 of the COPD Patients Charter refers to the patient\u2019s right to appropriate specialist care whenever the patient needs it [6]. Improving patient care requires using appropriate tools to assess the care for patients with COPD. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), PROMs can be defined as \u201cany reports of the status of a patient\u2019s health condition that comes directly from the patient (without interpretation of the patient\u2019s response by a clinician or anyone else)\u201d [7]. Such information is collected through standardized questionnaires. These endpoints were originally developed and implemented for use in clinical trials as a way to include the patient\u2019s voice in the evaluation of clinical interventions [8]. However, their use has gradually become more common, and today, they are considered an integral part of assessing clinical effectiveness and patient-centered care [9]. The second type of endpoints are PREMs. They allow for the patient\u2019s perception of their experience with the received care to be determined. Typically, they are structured questionnaires, but unlike PROMs, they do not assess care outcomes, but determine how patients perceive their experience of using care. They can be used as indicators of the quality of care (determined from the patients\u2019 perspective) at any level of healthcare system [10] and used by entitled agencies to assess medical technologies in the reimbursement process [11]. Like PROMs, PREMs also deliver information on the quality of care during the intervention, which allows for an immediate response and adjustments. Several publications have shown that considering patient experiences is a key factor in strengthening healthcare systems. These data may be used as a basis to identify quality, performance, or security issues [12,13]. The first PREM-type questionnaire that has been dedicated to assess the experience of care in COPD is the PREM-C9 [14]. It is a simple questionnaire validated for use in the population of patients with mild to severe COPD. However, this tool has not been validated under Polish conditions yet. Therefore, the study aims are as follows:\n\u2022 To create a Polish adaptation of the PREM-C9. \u2022 To determine the psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire used under Polish conditions. \u2022 To provide knowledge regarding the characteristics and the role of the PREM-C9\nin non-English-speaking countries, allowing for cross-cultural comparisons, determining further possibilities of using it, and generalizing the results obtained to other populations.\nIt is believed that the Polish validation of the PREM-C9 test will stimulate Polish research on the role of the patient\u2019s perspective in the treatment of COPD. Determining the usefulness of this questionnaire requires an examination of its validity and reliability. Thus, these parameters were assessed in a study on the Polish version of the PREM-C9. Questionnaire validity is understood as the level of agreement with which the assessed questionnaire measures what it was designed for. Reliability is defined as a questionnaire\u2019s ability to reflect the true value of the characteristic that has been evaluated [15].\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 2746 3 of 12"

In the Polish adaptation and validation of the questionnaire, we used the same questionnaires as in the original validation process (CATTM and HADS), with one additional general PROM\u2014EuroQol EQ-5D 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L). They are briefly described below. The COPD assessment test (CATTM) [19] (Polish version) is a disease-specific PROMtype questionnaire dedicated to people with COPD that assesses how the disease impacts a person\u2019s life and whether it changes over time. It consists of 8 items, and the answering scale is from 0 to 5, where 5 is the worst rating. The CAT considers the presence and severity of a cough, phlegm, a sense of tightness in the chest, breathlessness, limitations in performing everyday activities, self-confidence when leaving home, the quality of sleep, and the life energy level. A score of 5 points means the upper limit of normal in healthy non-smokers, <10 points means that COPD has a minor influence on the patient\u2019s life, 10\u201320 points means there is an average impact, >20 means there is a severe impact, and >30 means there is a very severe impact\u2014the disease makes it impossible to perform any everyday activities, and the patient never has good days. It is worth noting that the construction and graphic layout of PREM-C9 and CATTM are very similar. The hospital anxiety and depression scale modified version (HADS-m) [20] (Polish version) is a PROM-type questionnaire measuring anxiety and depression in patients who are somatically ill. It consists of three subscales\u2014depression (HADS-D), anxiety (HADS-A), and irritability (two questions from the last subscale were not used in the original version, and subsequently, they were not used in this study either). The whole questionnaire consists of 16 questions, which are evaluated on a 0\u20133 scale. The obtained results can be interpreted as follows: \u22647 = normal, 8 to 10 = borderline abnormal (borderline case), and\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 2746 6 of 12\n11 or higher = abnormal (case). Since, in this study, only two subscales (A and D) were used, the questionnaire will hereafter be referred to as HADS (as the modification was the addition of the third unused subscale). The European quality of life scale 5D 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L) [21] (Polish version) is a general PROM-type questionnaire consisting of 5 questions (considering: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression) that can be evaluated using 5 levels: no problems (1 point), slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, or extreme problems (5 points), and a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) to describe the general health status on the day of attending the study. The EQ-5D-5L is available in more than 150 languages and is one of the most frequently used generic questionnaires assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [22]."

In addition, the Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin (KMO) test results of >0.5 proved that there were relationships between the components and that they were selected appropriately, so the factor analysis was justified (Table 3).\nThe PCA (principal component analysis) factor extraction method using the Kaiser normalization criterion, with both Varimax and Oblimin rotation, identified three components (the same as in the English language version). In all the questions, a correlation value of at least 0.6 was obtained between the individual questions and the questionnaire as a whole, which means that each question in the Polish language version of the PREM-C9 is valid (contributes relevant content) and should not be removed. The lowest correlation value was obtained for question 4 (I am happy to talk about the future), but this was not below the accepted criterion and was noticeably higher when Oblimin was used as the rotation method. The next stage of the validity analysis was the convergent relevance analysis, for which Spearman\u2019s correlation was used between the PREM-C9 questionnaire assessed and the other questionnaires, i.e., HADS, CAT, EQ-5D-5L, and EQ-VAS (Table 4).

It was shown that the elimination of individual statements did\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 2746 8 of 12\nnot significantly affect Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient value for the rest of the questionnaire. The values obtained ranged from 0.690 to 0.767.

The validation of the PREM-C9 into Polish will allow the use of the questionnaire in the assessment of care for patients with COPD in Poland. The use of PREM indicators is still not a common practice, which previous studies have proven [24] and which limits the possibility of comparing the results obtained in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the Polish version of the PREM-C9 questionnaire with other works apart from the original assessment in the English language version. There are known studies using the PREM-C9 questionnaire in its original version. For example, a study by Jones et al. [23] measured patients\u2019 experiences of living with COPD and the medical care they received, and the results were compared with other scales\u2014some of which were also used in the validation study of the Polish language version (CAT and HADS). The correlation rho of the PREM-C9 (for all domains combined) with the CAT questionnaire score was 0.27 (thus, less than in the present study), but it was a statistically significant relationship (p = 0.03). However, only a result measuring towards significance was obtained for the correlation with the HADS-D subscale (p = 0.09). The correlation level obtained in the present study between the PREM-C9 test and the CAT questionnaire was 0.44, which is similar to the values obtained in the original validation of the tool (0.42). Similar results were also obtained for the HADS-A, and slightly lower results were obtained for the HADS-D [14]. In addition to the English language version, the PREM-C9 was translated into Catalan and Spanish [25]. Ten patients participated in this study; however, this study did not determine the questionnaire\u2019s psychometric values, as the authors only translated it. Chaplin et al. defined a meaningful change in the PREM-9 following pulmonary rehabilitation. The change in the PREM-9 for responders (defined as a HADS anxiety MID \u2265 \u22121.5) was \u22125.26 (SD: 8.33). A sensitivity and specificity analysis using an ROC with a HADS anxiety anchor yielded a change of \u22127.5 units. The minimum important difference for the PREM-9 was calculated between \u22123.67 and \u22127.5 units [26]. The PCA analysis using the Kaiser normalization criterion with Varimax and Oblimin rotation obtained the lowest correlation value for question 4 (I am happy to talk about the future). It should be acknowledged that the nature of the question itself may have influenced the result, as it is of a general type, going beyond the context of the disease itself; hence, it can be assumed that the results obtained for this question differed slightly from the others. An assessment of the reliability of the Polish version of the PREM-C9 questionnaire confirmed that it is a reliable tool and, therefore, correctly (accurately) reflects the actual condition. Cronbach\u2019s alpha index was 0.743. According to various sources, even 0.6 can be considered a satisfactory level, although more often, it is 0.7 [27,28]. Slightly higher values\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 2746 10 of 12\nwere obtained in the validation of PREM-type tools dedicated to other conditions, e.g., rheumatic conditions [29], oncological conditions [30], and hypertension [31]. However, these were not studies conducted in a Polish setting; such studies, apart from this one, have not yet been produced. In addition, a literature review performed in Germany in 2022 showed that none of the PREM-type questionnaires analyzed were fully evaluated under German conditions [32]."

            "text": "The benefits of using the patient perspective in shaping effective healthcare are well accepted. For example, the addition of these data in the care of patients with metastatic cancer to those collected in a standard way resulted in an increased survival compared to traditionally managed care [33], and in a group of patients with arthritis, it improved the self-perceived health [34]. Using PROM- and PREM-type data also reduces the utilization of healthcare system resources by improving symptom control, increasing patient satisfaction, and ultimately improving the HRQoL [35]. Much attention has been paid over the years to the reliability of questionnaires of the PROM and PREM type while at the same time pointing to the need to develop new validated research tools [36]. This study resulted in the development, in accordance with current principles, of a PREM-type questionnaire, the psychometric properties of which were meticulously examined and confirmed. This study may inspire and encourage other researchers to develop and use this type of questionnaire in patient care. What may be of note in the study is the small study group (42 patients). However, it should be clear that there are no specific guidelines on the minimum number of respondents for this type of study [37]. In the publication by Tsang et al. presenting guidelines for developing, translating, and validating questionnaires, guidance can be found suggesting that these processes should utilize between 30 and 50 people, and similar guidance can be found in a broader study by Aithal [38]."
