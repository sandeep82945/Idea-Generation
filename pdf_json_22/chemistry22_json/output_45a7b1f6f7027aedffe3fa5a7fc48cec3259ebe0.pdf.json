    "abstractText": "Different machine learning (ML) models are proposed in the present work to predict DFTquality barrier heights (BHs) from semiempirical quantum-mechanical (SQM) calculations. The ML models include multi-task deep neural network, gradient boosted trees by means of the XGBoost interface, and Gaussian process regression. The obtained mean absolute errors (MAEs) are similar or slightly better than previous models considering the same number of data points. Unlike other ML models employed to predict BHs, entropic effects are included, which enables the prediction of rate constants at different temperatures. The ML corrections proposed in this paper could be useful for rapid screening of the large reaction networks that appear in Combustion Chemistry or in Astrochemistry. Finally, our results show that 70% of the bespoke predictors are amongst the features with the highest impact on model output. This custom-made set of predictors could be employed by future \uf044-ML models to improve the quantitative prediction of other reaction properties.",

            "text": "Transition state theory (TST) provides an useful means to study the kinetics of elementary chemical reactions.1 Depending on the specific version, TST requires a more or less exhaustive knowledge of the potential energy surface of the system.2 In the absence of strong tunnelling effects, the value of the Gibbs energy of activation \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc3a\u2021 (Gibbs energy difference between the transition state (TS) and the reactant) is sufficient to predict the rate of reaction. At 0 K, \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc3a\u2021 is just the electronic energy difference between the TS and reactant including their zero-point vibrational energies (ZPEs), called the barrier height (BH). Although the BH does not include the thermal correction to enthalpy and the entropic contribution, sometimes it is employed as a proxy for the true Gibbs energy of activation. Nevertheless, predicting highly accurate BHs (of sub kcal/mol accuracy) requires the use of expensive ab initio methods, such as the gold standard coupled cluster including single and double excitations with perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)].3 Fortunately, today\u2019s state-of-the-art density functionals predict BHs that are rather close to the accurate CCSD(T),4 thus being the method of choice for modelling large systems. However, even DFT becomes prohibitive for biochemical systems or for complex reaction networks of medium-size systems.\nWith the surge of large computational and experimental datasets, machine learning (ML) is shifting the paradigm to data-driven predictive modelling. This approach has been pursued to predict activation energies and BHs in previous works.5-15 By way of example, Choi et al. developed different ML models to predict activation energies of gasphase reactions, with the tree boosting method showing the best performance.5 More recently, Green and co-workers have demonstrated that it is possible to predict accurate BHs using a deep learning (DL) model given only reactant and product graphs.6, 8 Green\u2019s DL model was trained on a gas-phase organic chemistry (GPOC) data set of 12,000\n3\u00a0 \u00a0\nchemical reactions involving carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. The calculations\nwere carried out at the DFT B97X-D3/def2-TZVP quantum chemistry level, which has shown to predict BHs with errors of only 2.28 kcal/mol.4 They recently improved the model using fewer parameters and proper data splits to estimate performance on unseen reactions.8 Also, Habershon and co-workers employed this basis set to predict rates of chemical reactions.16 Alexandrova and co-workers have also shown that topological descriptors of the quantum mechanical charge density in the reactant state can be used to predict BHs for Diels-Alder reactions.9 Hybrid models combining traditional TS modelling and ML are also employed to predict BHs for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions in solution.10\nSemi-empirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods are significantly faster than DFT and provide results with sufficient accuracy when applied to molecules of the same type as those of the training set.17 However, except when the interest is in a specific reaction,1822 training sets do not usually include data of TSs, which results in inaccurate BH predictions. In an attempt to model the reactivity of organic reactions with useful accuracy, Stewart developed the SQM method called PM7-TS.17 Using a training set of 97 BHs obtained from collections of high-level calculations, the mean absolute error (MAE) using PM7-TS was 3.8 kcal/mol, as compared with the MAEs for PM7 of 11.0 kcal/mol and for PM6 of 12.2 kcal/mol.17 However, Jensen and co-workers benchmarked PM7-TS using barrier heights for five model enzymes and found a MAE of 19 kcal/mol, while the MAEs for PM6 and PM7 were around 12-15 kcal/mol.23 Iron and Janes24 have also shown that SQM methods perform very poorly predicting transition metal barrier heights: using a new dataset with high-accurate energies, the MAEs of PM6, PM7 and PM7-TS are 21.6, 106.4 and 68.2 kcal/mol. In his PM7 paper, Stewart already\n4\u00a0 \u00a0\nacknowledged that the predictive power of PM7-TS was unknown at the time, and suggested parameter re-optimization as more BHs became available.17\nAn alternative to parameter optimization is to develop analytical25 or ML corrections\nof the SQM calculations. The latter are usually termed -machine learning because the\nmodel predicts the difference between the benchmark and the approximate baseline calculation (SQM in this case).26 There are some examples in the literature of the successful use of machine learning to improve the accuracy of both DFT27-29 and SQM calculations.30, 31\nIn this work we leverage machine learning to predict barrier heights with DFT accuracy at the cost of SQM calculations. The model employs multi-task deep neural network (DNN), gradient boosted trees by means of the XGBoost interface,32 and Gaussian process regression (GPR) trained on a curated version of the GPOC data set.7 Gradient boosting regression has been successfully applied to predict BHs in Diels-Alder reactions,9 and the reactivity of transition metal complexes.15 Similarly, GPR have shown a great performance in complex potential energy surface fittings,33-36 predicting spectroscopic constants of diatomic molecules37, 38 and second virial coefficients of organic and inorganic compounds.39 The selected SQM model was PM7,17 which is overall the most accurate method implemented in MOPAC2016.40 To fully exploit the SQM calculations, several input features are constructed from the electronic and structural properties of reactant, transition states and products. Unlike some of the previous ML models, entropic effects can be approximately computed from the available structure and vibrational frequencies of both reactant and transition states. This important feature of our model enables the prediction of rate constants at different temperatures. Moreover, the model makes different predictions for cases where two transition states exist for the same rearrangement.41 A similar synergistic SQM/ML approach to predict\n5\u00a0 \u00a0\nactivation energies for a diverse class of C-C bond forming nitro-Michael additions has been recently proposed.42\nThe ML correction proposed in this paper could be employed in rapid screening of the large reaction networks that appear in Combustion Chemistry or in Astrochemistry. SQM-based methods for automated reaction mechanism prediction like AutoMeKin43-46 could also greatly benefit from this machine learning model."

In general,\nPM7-TS significantly underestimates the BHs with a MAE of 22.5 kcal/mol, which is in line with the deviation obtained by Jensen and co-workers on a data set of model enzymes23 and much greater than the reported error of 3.8 kcal/mol on the training set employed to optimize the PM7-TS parameters.17 By contrast, the MAEs of a different\n6\u00a0 \u00a0\nSQM method (AM1) evaluated on a dataset of 1000 Michael addition reactions was only 5.71 kcal/mol, with SQM overestimating in general the barrier heights,42 although in this case all BHs were below 45 kcal/mol.\nThese results call for an alternative method to predict accurate SQM-based BHs.

Obtaining BHs at the PM7 SQM level entails a more involved process, as several sanity checks are required. A flow chart diagram explaining how the PM7 BHs were obtained is shown in Figure 2. The first step, labeled as TS optimization in the figure, consists of optimizing the TSs at the PM7 level using as initial guesses the geometries optimized at the DFT level. Some structures could not be optimized at the PM7 level and were discarded. Then, for each successfully optimized TS structure, an IRC calculation47 is carried out in each direction (IRC=1 and IRC=-1 in the figure). The IRC end points are compared with the reactant and product present in the dataset. For such a comparison, the eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrices (with their diagonals representing the atomic numbers) were employed.48 Obtaining identical eigenvalues ensures that the connectivity of each structure (reactant and product) is the same at both levels of theory of theory (DFT and SQM). When the connectivity differs for either reactant or product, the reaction is discarded. Otherwise, both the IRC end point and the structure from the dataset are optimized at the PM7 level and compared to ensure they present the same conformation. For this last comparison that involves 3D structures, the eigenvalues of a weighted adjacency matrix are employed.48\nFrom the initial 11,860 reactions, 8,355 survived this screening process, meaning that roughly 70% of the samples could be utilized in our model. The use of reverse barrier heights did not lead to a major improvement during training of the model but increased the computational cost, so this form of data augmentation was discarded.\nAn exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the curated GPOC dataset was then carried out. The detailed results of our EDA are collected in the Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI). Reactions in the dataset contain up to seven heavy atoms (C, N or O)\n8\u00a0 \u00a0\nper molecule and consist of unimolecular reactions leading to one or more products (although most reactions are isomerizations)."

            "text": "Figure 3 shows the workflow for the two machine learning models employed in this study to correct SQM barrier heights. A crucial step of the models is the calculation of a set of descriptors (or input features) that encode the most useful information present in every reaction. Our models employ two types of descriptors: a) standard RDKit-based descriptors and b) a custom set based on the SQM calculations and chemical intuition. Figure 3 also shows how every species in the reaction (namely TS, reactant, or product) contributes to each set of descriptors.\nThe first set of descriptors \ud835\udc4b is obtained from the cheminformatics library RDKit.49 Each descriptor of this type \ud835\udc4b , is calculated as:\n9\u00a0 \u00a0\n\ud835\udc4b , \ud835\udc4b , \ud835\udc4b , (1) where \ud835\udc4b , and \ud835\udc4b , refer to the i-th RDKit descriptor of the reactant and product, respectively. If a specific descriptor remains invariant in the reaction (like the molecular weight), the raw value is employed instead of eq 1. The \ud835\udc4b set contains 132 descriptors (see the ESI for details).\nBesides the above standard set of descriptors, a custom set is also employed in this work. This set is specifically tailored to extract the most relevant features of chemical reactions. It comprises information on the topology of the TS, number of bonds that change in the reaction, and results from the PM7 calculations.\nAn advantage of our model is that the approximate TS structures calculated at the PM7 level of theory can be employed as input features. Specifically, the 3D geometries are converted into molecular graphs, represented in the form of adjacency matrices, using the definitions employed in AutoMeKin.46 From the molecular graphs, some topological descriptors \ud835\udc4b can be constructed. These include Randic\u2019s connectivity index,50 the spectral gap (or lowest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, \ud835\udf06 ), the Estrada index,51 or the Zagreb index;52 the full list of topological descriptors can be found in the ESI. The Laplacian matrix defined as \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc34 (with \ud835\udc37 and \ud835\udc34 being the degree and adjacency matrices, respectively) is calculated from a weighted adjacency matrix to account for 3D structures of the TSs.46 Topological descriptors provide a measure of the extent of branching, or the tightness of the TS structure.\nThe subset \ud835\udc4b includes the number of broken and formed bonds of each type, i.e., all pairings of H, C, N and O atoms. For instance, this set includes the descriptors +CO\nand CH, which refer to the number of formed CO bonds and number of broken CH\nbonds, respectively.\n10\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe last subset of descriptors \ud835\udc4b capitalizes on the PM7 calculations. This set includes, the barrier height BH, a rough proxy for the rate constant \ud835\udc52 , the imaginary frequency at the TS \ud835\udf08 and differences between ZPEs of reactant, product and TS: ZPER, ZPEP, ZPETS, respectively. The subset also comprises electronic descriptors like the eigenvalues of the bond order matrix calculated at the TS, the global \u201chardness\u201d53 and Mulliken\u2019s electronegativity54 at the TS (\ud835\udf02 and \ud835\udefc , respectively), and differences between the self-polarizability55 of reactant \ud835\udf0b and product \ud835\udf0b . While some of these descriptors are readily available from a frequency calculation at the TS, others are obtained using the keyword SUPER in MOPAC.\nHaving defined the input features, a correlation matrix was built where each entry represents the Pearson coefficient \ud835\udc5f for every pair of descriptors. A threshold was established such that if the correlation coefficient exceeds this value, one of the descriptors is dropped from the input features. The threshold was optimized by crossvalidation and set to \ud835\udc5f 0.9.\nThese stacked descriptors are input to the three models depicted in Figure 3: DNN, XGBoost and GPR. DNN works in a multi-task approach, where the output includes, besides the barrier height, the energy difference between reactant and product. This approach has shown to enhance predictions and generalization power, even if our interest is only on the BHs.6, 56 The architecture of the DNN model (number of hidden layers and number of neurons) as well as other hyperparameters were fine-tuned in a 5-fold crossvalidation fashion using a grid search, considering some hyperparameters to be orthogonal.\nNevertheless, since our set of descriptors consists of heterogeneous tabular data and the amount of data is limited by deep learning standards, we decided to use two alternative approaches, that perform better in this case, XGBoost and GPR.57 In particular, we chose\n11\u00a0 \u00a0\nXGBoost32 implementation of gradient boosting techniques, which achieves SOTA results and provides sparsity-aware algorithms particularly suited for our dataset. In this case, hyperparameters were optimized by means of the Bayesian optimization library Optuna,58 using 5-fold cross validation as well. Furthermore, considering that Gradient boosting techniques that rely on decision trees as weak learners assign higher importance to descriptors that will be more relevant for other models, we find a more succinct descriptor X\u2019 containing only 49 features to feed in the GPR model. The GPR model, after being exposed to the training data generates a multivariate Gaussian prior distribution that by means of Bayesian inference leads to a posterior distribution for the test set. Thus, leading to a prediction with a confidence interval based on the inherent Bayesian nature of the model.\nThe obtained ML corrections (with DNN, XGBoost or GPR) to PM7 will be referred\nto as PM7+ML."

            "text": "Models can be interpreted in terms of their feature importances, i.e., how much a certain feature contributes to the prediction. Feature importances are obtained in present work from the SHAP values,59 which resort to game-theoretic approaches to measure the contribution to the model output by each descriptor. The underlying principle is to measure the expected change in output when using different combinations of descriptors.\nFigure 6 shows a SHAP summary plot, which displays the magnitude and direction of a feature\u2019s effect. Interestingly, 70% (14/20) of the most important features belong to the custom set. As expected, the features with the greatest impact on the model output are the values of the PM7 barrier height \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3b and the proxy for the rate constant \ud835\udc52 . The\n14\u00a0 \u00a0\nfigure shows that PM7 tends to underestimate high BHs and viceversa, which is reflected by the positive impact on the model output for high BHs. Our result is in agreement with a recent ML model to predict activation energies from DFT calculations, where the DFTcomputed activation energy was also the most important feature.10\nThe \u201chardness\u201d \ud835\udf02 and Mulliken\u2019s electronegativity \ud835\udefc calculated at the TS also rank very high on the global feature importance plot. Using Koopman\u2019s theorem60 they can be approximated as \ud835\udf02 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udf00 /2 and \ud835\udefc \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udf00 /2, where \ud835\udf00 and \ud835\udf00 are the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), respectively. These descriptors have been employed as an index to predict chemical behavior and reactivity61-67 and even to locate TSs.68 The value of \ud835\udf02 decreases as the molecule departs from its equilibrium position, attaining a minimum at the TS. The LUMO/HOMO energies have also been employed to predict activation energies in Diels-Alder reactions.11\nWith similar impacts on the model output, the absolute value of the imaginary frequency \ud835\udf14 and the lowest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian \ud835\udf06 (or spectral gap) at the TS are also among the most important descriptors according to Figure 6. Both provide a measure for the tightness of the TS structure, with the imaginary frequency also containing information on the mass of the atoms involved in the reaction coordinate.\nNumber of formed CH and CO bonds (+CH and +CO, respectively), number of broken\nCH bonds (CH), ZPE differences among reactant, TS and product, the PM7 reaction enthalpy (\ud835\udc38 ) or the self-polarizabilities (\ud835\udf0b and \ud835\udf0b ) also contribute among the most important features. The importance of the number of formed/broken bonds of different types in the model output can be explained by the accuracy of SQM methods predicting bond energies, which strongly depends on the bond type.69\n15\u00a0 \u00a0\nRDKIT descriptors considered important include SMR_VSA (RDKIT 1), LabuteASA (RDKIT 2)70 and VSA_EState2 (RDKIT 7). These descriptors grant a measure of the approximate accessible van der Waals surface area per atom. Other relevant descriptors are: Balaban J (RDKIT 3), referring to the connectivity distance of the molecular graph,71 Chi0_v72 (RDKIT 6), which is also a topological based descriptor, and MolLogP73 (RDKIT 5), which refers to atom-based partition coefficients.\nFigure 7 showcases how SHAP values can be used for interpretation of a single reaction. It shows the descriptors that contribute the most to shift the prediction of the model from its average (expected) prediction. Not surprisingly, \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3b and \ud835\udc52 as well as other descriptors of Figure 6 contribute significantly also for this particular reaction. Additionally, since this reaction involves formation of molecular hydrogen, the number of formed H-H bonds (+HH) is also an important descriptor.\n16\u00a0 \u00a0"

            "text": "In mechanistic and kinetics studies of chemical reactions the quantity of interest is the Gibbs energy of activation \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc3a\u2021, rather than the BH. The reason is because the former includes enthalpic and entropic corrections to the electronic and ZPE energies. Reaction channels that are not very competitive at low temperatures/energies might become predominant at high temperatures/energies because of the entropic factors.74 Therefore, the prediction of \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc3a\u2021 is crucial when the interest is the kinetics and the determination of the predominant mechanism.\nThe calculation of \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc3a\u2021 is straightforward when the geometries and vibrational frequencies of the reactant and TS are available. An advantage of our model is that this data is available, though at the approximate SQM level of theory. The values of \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc3a\u2021 have been obtained in this work at different temperatures using the thermochemistry module of AutoMeKin46 for the reference and SQM calculations using the rigid rotor/harmonic\noscillator approximation. In the absence of a scaling factor for the B97X-D3/def2-TZVP\nvibrational frequencies, the value of 0.9914 was employed; this is the recommended value for the related B97X-D/def2-TZVP model chemistry.75 Furthermore, the PM7 vibrational frequencies were corrected using the recommended scaling factors.76\nFigure 8 displays the correlation between the reference (DFT), the PM7, and the PM7+ML prediction for \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc3a\u2021 at three different temperatures: 300, 500 and 1000 K. At the two lowest temperatures, the PM7+ML prediction is roughly of the same accuracy as that for the BH. However, for the highest temperature of 1000 K, the ML prediction starts to deteriorate and the MAE at this temperature is 5.30 kcal/mol. A clear improvement to the model would be to use a multitask ML model to correct the SQM vibrational frequencies.\n17\u00a0 \u00a0\nNevertheless, the current accuracy of the PM7+ML model significantly improves on the PM7 accuracy, and it may suffice for fast screening of reaction networks."

Descriptor explanation:\nList of descriptors in the dataset (using the same name convention as in the provided dataset):\n\u25cf Graph-theoretic (topological) descriptors:\n\u25cb randic_index: captures the contributions per bond to each vertex. [1] \u25cb zagreb_index: graph invariant descriptor [2]. \u25cb avg_clustering: descriptor that measures how close an atom is to its neighbors.\n[3]\n\u25cb atom_bond_conn_idx: provides an estimate to the strain energy of cycloalkanes.\n[4]\n\u25cb estrada_index: \u25cb lap_eig: Eigenvalues of the transition state Laplacian matrix, which need to be\npadded to the maximum number of atoms in the dataset.\n\u25cf MOPAC descriptors:\n\u25cb Dn, De, piS, Mul, Par_n_Pople: Nucleophilic and Electrophilic delocalizabilites,\nSelf-Polarizability, Mulliken Electronegativity, and Parr & Pople absolute hardness. These are quantities derived from the density matrix [5].\n\u25cb Freq: first real-valued frequency of a transition state. \u25cb BO_eigs: Eigenvalues of the bond order matrix provided by the MOPAC\ncalculation.\n\u25cb ZPE: Zero Point Energy computed using MOPAC. \u25cb Differences of the previous quantities between the entities involved in the\nreaction (e.g. ZPE_TS_R refers to subtracting the ZPE of the reactant from the ZPE of the transition state.\n\u25cb AE_mopac and exp_mopac: barrier height and minus the exponential of the\nbarrier height computed at MOPAC level of theory.\n\u25cb DH_mopac: reaction enthalpy computed at MOPAC level of theory.\n\u25cf Bond descriptors:\n\u25cb Broken_bonds: Number of broken bonds. \u25cb Formed_bonds: Number of formed bonds. \u25cb Total_bonds: Number of total bonds. \u25cb Counts of the type of atoms in the reaction (e.g. n_H is the count of Hydrogen\natoms in the reaction).\n\u25cb Counts of the type of bonds involved in the reaction (e.g. co_f refers to the\nnumber of C-O bonds formed in the reaction).\n\u25cf RDKit descriptors [6].\n10\nThe data and code are available in the following repository: https://github.com/XabierGA/SemiDFT\n4.
