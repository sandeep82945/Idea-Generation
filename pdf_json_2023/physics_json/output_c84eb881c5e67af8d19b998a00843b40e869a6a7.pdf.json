Our previous studies developed MgO/Mg(OH)2 composites to facilitate CO2 diffusion, improving capture efficiency. However, MgCO3 still formed along the interfaces. To tackle this issue, we engineered the MgO/Mg(OH)2 interfaces by incorporating Cl\u2212, SO4 2\u2212, and PO4 3\u2212 additives. Novel MgO\u2013H2O\u2013MgX (X = Cl \u2212, SO4 2\u2212, and PO4 3\u2212) composites were synthesized to explore the role of additives in preventing MgCO3 formation.

            "text": "The escalating concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have emerged as a pressing global concern, with far-reaching implications for all life forms on Earth. Among the greenhouse gases, the signicant role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in causing global warming is widely recognized.1\u20133 Recent data indicates that atmospheric CO2 levels reached an average of 419.77 ppm by the end of February 2023, marking a substantial increase from 338.80 ppm in 1980.4 In response, scientists are actively seeking solutions to mitigate CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The synthesis of MgO powder from reject brine, which is a waste product from desalination plants, has been the subject of numerous experimental studies. Reject brine comprises large amounts of multiple anions and cations such as Cl\u2212 (65593.1 ppm), Na+ (16124.3 ppm), Mg2+ (1679.0 ppm), SO4 2\u2212 (4322.6 ppm), Ca2+ (563.6 ppm) and many others.5\u20138 Typically, plants treat reject brine to remove these concentrated anions before releasing them back to the sea. However, there is a potential for extracting the ions along with MgO directly from reject brine. Consequently, it offers signicant prospects for\nuct Development, Singapore University of 87372, Singapore.

They are mainly classied as polymeric membranes, ionic liquids (ILs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs), amine sorbents, and carbons. Even though they record high capture capacities, ability of disposing them to the environment without any harmful hazard is limited.9 Solid adsorbents have proven successful in trapping concentrated CO2 from industrial exhaust gases, offering an effective means of storage rather than direct emission into the environment.10 Several solid adsorbents with promising CO2 capture capacities have recently been proposed, with metal oxides emerging as particularly favorable candidates.11\u201313 Discovering a solid sorbent material capable of capturing CO2 at room temperature (RT) holds numerous advantages, including lower energy requirements, making the process economically viable for largescale applications.14 Notably, magnesium (Mg)-based minerals present an abundant and environmentally benign option that can be produced on a signicant scale at a relatively low cost.15 However, their inherent structural and morphological features restrict their adsorption capabilities, necessitating modications to unlock their full potential.\nMgO stands out to be a viable candidate for CO2 capture due to its higher theoretical CO2 capture capacity together with lower energy demand in regeneration in comparison to other metal oxides.16 Additionally, MgO is abundant on earth, of low cost and non-toxicity, and has a wide operating temperature (from room temperature to intermediate temperature).17 More, MgO exhibits signicant CO2 chemisorption selectivity at temperatures below 200 \u00b0C.10,16,18\u201321 Despite its high theoretical CO2 capture capacity (1100 mg CO2/g sorbent), practical usage\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Under dry, high-temperature conditions, MgO reacts with CO2, forming Magnesium carbonate (MgCO3).10,15 However, at lower temperatures and in moist conditions, MgO reacts with H2O to create intermediate products or hydrates that exhibit CO2 adsorption capabilities. Nevertheless, CO2 and H2O molecules may compete for adsorption sites on the MgO surface.10 Furthermore, the continuous exposure of the MgO surface to CO2 leads to saturation with MgCO3, impeding further CO2 insertion.22Hu et al.,10 and Ruhaimi et al.,23 recently reviewed on the MgO based adsorbents for CO2 capture synthesized using various methods and at various conditions. The MgO synthesised by Zhao et al.,24 using combined surfactant assisted solvothermal or hydrothermal processes reported around 3.68 wt% of CO2 uptake below 350 \u00b0C. Elvira et al.,25 reported on MgO sorbent prepared using solution-combustion process and Ball milling method recording 1.61 wt% at 25 \u00b0C. Bhagiyalakshmi et al.,26 studied the MgO synthesized using template method at 25 \u00b0C recording about 8 wt%. A study by Song et al.,27 reported that the commercial MgO has the capture capacity of 0.88 wt%. They compared this with the porous structures calcined at different temperatures, where the best sample reported 3.6 wt% CO2 uptake. To overcome this challenge of low CO2 capture capacity of MgO itself, it is crucial to explore modiedMgO-basedmaterials and exploit their CO2 absorption mechanisms.\nRecent studies have investigated the effects of Li, Na, and K nitrates on CO2 adsorption using commercial MgO powders at 300 \u00b0C. Optimization of the Li, Na, and K nitrate ratios for MgO doping enhances CO2 solubility in the salts and accelerates CO2 uptake, particularly when considering the inuence of O2 concentrations on nitrites.28 Another approach involves the adoption of a solution combustion method by Elvira et al., resulting in the production of MgO doped with urea at a 2 : 1 molar ratio of urea to magnesium nitrate. This strategy increases the CO2 adsorption capability from RT to 300 \u00b0C.25 Our research group has also reported signicant progress in CO2 adsorption by developing bio-inspired MgO\u2013Mg(OH)2 composites through a controlled steaming technique, albeit restricted to the MgO\u2013H2O binary system. This technique has shown a remarkable improvement of approximately 25% in CO2 adsorption.29 Theoretical investigations on MgO\u2013CaO composites incorporating Li, Na, K, and Rb promoters have revealed the successful utilization of Li dopants, which lead to changes in the properties of crystal surfaces, ultimately attracting CO2.30 However, the practical implementation of these active compounds raises concerns regarding environmental safety.\nOver the years, various processes and methods have been employed to synthesize improved MgO-based adsorbents. These include sol\u2013gel synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis, aerogel methods, ball-milling, template methods, and others, all contributing to the development of modied MgO materials for CO2 capture.31\u201333 Although these synthesis methods yield highly efficient MgO sorbents, they tend to be costly. In contrast, electrospinning offers a cost-effective approach to produce nanostructures and is renowned for its durability, adaptability, and scalability.13 Our research group has recently reported\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\na study utilizing electrospinning to achieve mineralized CO2 capture from air at room temperature, using magnesium carbonate hydrate-based materials that achieved approximately 15.5 wt% of CO2 adsorption.21 This approach represents a smart strategy, bridging the gap between the current trial-and-error methods and a bioinspired rational design approach for developing MgO-based CO2 adsorbents.\nIn this research, our objective is to propose and validate two design rules using electrospinning synthesis techniques, aiming to develop a technique that incorporates both CO2-philic and CO2-phobic characteristics. (1) To design a highly efficient CO2 adsorbent, need to develop a tool that may couple the surface CO2-philic and CO2-phobic properties to balance the nucleation and transportation process during CO2 absorption. This is to eliminate the total obstruction of surface by the formed MgCO3 and allow new CO2 molecules to further absorbed through, as demonstrated in our previous study via a steaming process within the MgO\u2013H2O binary system.29 The CO2-philic (MgO) and CO2-phobic (Mg(OH)2) domains in the sample further aid adsorbing additional fresh CO2 molecules, despite the persistence of intermittent MgCO3 precipitations neighboring MgO.34 CO2-philic parts are mainly for CO2 capturing while the CO2-phobic parts provide CO2 transport channels, which are unavailable in MgO. (2) To further mitigate the formation of MgCO3 along theMgO/Mg(OH)2 interfaces, our investigation focuses on ternary composites of Cl\u2212, PO4\n3\u2212, and"

Initially, the selection of anion X is based on observations highlighting their similar size and electronegativity, which result in comparable properties.35 Subsequently, we validate our selection through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and chemical engineering modelling and simulation. This contribution demonstrates a novel strategy that employs magnesium-based dopants to achieve two key objectives: (1) maintaining a balanced CO2-philic and CO2phobic function and (2) inhibiting the formation of MgCO3 along the composite interfaces in the design of ternary MgO\u2013 H2O\u2013MgX systems.

The 10% Cl\u2212 doped MgO showed a similar structure to 5% Cl\u2212 doped MgO presenting sheet-like uniform structure. The morphology of the SO4\n2\u2212 doped MgO samples shown in Fig. 2b, displayed sheet-like structures. However, increasing SO4\n2\u2212 concentrations, the grain size was observed to be decreasing. The variations in morphology are comparable to those of MgO developed from Mg(OH)2 using various alkali salts when dopant concentrations increase from 1, 5, and 10 wt% Cl\u2212.6\nThe loss of water during the breakdown of Mg(OH)2 creates a porous structure that will lled with the newly generated MgO particles.6 The PO4\n3\u2212 doped MgO samples in Fig. 2c also observed to be sheet-like structures under the similar conditions, indicating a strong presence of heterogeneously grown hydrates which support by the XRD data. The morphology of the PO4 3\u2212 doped MgO samples are varied from those of the Cl\u2212 and SO4 2\u2212 doped MgO samples. The sheet like structures provide a room to trap CO2 in between the layers. The tailored surface chemistry by the dopants may form more defects and vacancies on and in between the sheet like structures, aiding to CO2 adsorption.39"

Therefore, the 10% Cl\u2212 doped sample which performed better in comparison to other doped samples, subjected to adsorption/ desorption cycles as shown in Fig. 5. The 10% Cl\u2212 doped sample's CO2 absorption at 30 \u00b0C was discovered to fall from 5.12 to 4.19 wt% during 10 cycles, demonstrating the novel adsorbent's strong long-term adsorption/desorption stability. In comparison, to the recent studies,28,43 the 10% Cl\u2212 doped sample, the drop rate of CO2 adsorption capacity over 10 adsorption/desorption cycles at 30 \u00b0C was about 18%, suggesting a better cycle stability indicating the adsorbent material may perform well in capturing the atmospheric CO2 long term.\nAs the 5% Cl\u2212 doped sample observed to have the higher surface area, the same sample was then subjected to analyze the gas sensing capability at high temperature conditions. Alphaterpineol was used (Sigma-Aldrich) as the binder and 0.01 g of 5% Cl\u2212 doped powder was mixed with 0.01 ml of alpha-terpineol. Then, the mixed solution was coated on the electrode substrate using the screen-printing method. Subsequently, the samples were dried at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. Finally, to remove remaining solvents, the samples were heat-treated at 250 \u00b0C for 1 h in air.\nThe properties of the 5% Cl\u2212 doped sample sensor, interdigitated titanium and platinum electrodes were sequentially deposited by direct current (DC) sputtering on the substrate\n27952 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 27946\u201327955\nwith thicknesses of 50 nm and 200 nm, respectively.

The chemisorption of CO2 renders the 5% Cl\u2212 doped composite a subpar CO2 sensing material. Table 2 summarizes the CO2 gas response in 5% Cl \u2212 doped composites. The measurement at 300 \u00b0C detects the CO2 at 500 ppm levels because of the thermal decomposition temperature to MgCO3 is about 327 \u00b0C.

The electronic structure of the adsorbent is crucial to its affinity.

Since CO2 is a Lewis acid molecule and tends to accept electrons, the accumulation of electrons on the O2\u2212 anions are benecial to the attraction of CO2 molecules to MgO surface containing O atoms. As to the OH\u2212 anion in Mg(OH)2, the strong covalent contribution to O\u2013H bonding caused by the deep overlapping of the valence orbitals of oxygen and hydrogen is established in the vertical direction. In contrast, the regular torus-shaped isosurface in the planar directions is formed from contributions of localized lone-paired electrons. Due to the oriented vertical deformation of the localized electronic cloud from sphericity, this covalency has partially polar character with negative O ion and position H ion. The positively charged H cations are obstructive to the attraction of CO2 molecules to Mg(OH)2 surface comprised by H atoms. The distinctive discrepancy of affinity to CO2 molecules in MgO and Mg(OH)2 surfaces gives rise to signicantly different CO2 adsorption behaviors.\nAdsorption of CO2 molecules on the most stable (001) MgO and Mg(OH)2 surfaces are simulated respectively with their corresponding partial density of states (PDOS) are presented in Fig. 7. Appreciable hybridization of p orbitals between C atom and O (MgO) atoms and trivial hybridization of p orbitals of O (CO2) atom and s orbital of Mg atoms are observed in MgO surface, indicating strong interaction between C and O (MgO) atoms. This is consistent with the inferred strong affinity of MgO to CO2 molecules. The interaction leads to the strong physical adsorption of CO2 to MgO surface. This is evidenced by the calculated CO2 adsorption energy \u22120.48 eV. No perceptible hybridization between C atom and O(Mg(OH)2) atom or between O(CO2) atom andMg atom in Mg(OH)2 surface is noted in Fig. 6b, being consistent with the weak affinity of Mg(OH)2 to CO2 molecules. Therefore, the adsorption of CO2 molecules on Mg(OH)2 surface is entirely by weak dispersion forces. This agrees with the calculated marginal CO2 adsorption energy \u22120.046 eV. The energy barrier from physisorption to chemisorption is generally dened as \u22120.52 eV. Therefore, MgO and Mg(OH)2 can be classied as the strong end and the weak end of the physical adsorption of CO2 respectively. Consequently, it can be assumed that MgO is CO2-philic adsorbent while Mg(OH)2 is CO2-phobic adsorbent.\nOne intriguing feature of Mg(OH)2 is that it is a chemically versatile solid hydroxide. It can be dehydrated into simple oxide and water under heat,44\nMg\u00f0OH\u00de2 4 550K MgO\u00feH2O vice versa, it can be synthesized via the backward reaction with the thermal mechanism represented as the following:45\nH2Odissolved + Ostructure 2\u2212 / (OH\u2212)structure + (OH \u2212)structure\nThe transformation from MgO to Mg(OH)2 is mainly achieved by structural rearrangements of O2\u2212 ions.

Therefore, it renders us an opportunity to synthesize interweaved MgO\u2013Mg(OH)2 composites to mimic Namib Desert Beetles, whose surface texture is comprised of wax free hydrophilic bumps and waxy hydrophobic valleys, for efficient water collection and droplet formation.46 With controlling of calcination temperature, it is potential to synthesize surface texture with interweaved CO2philic MgO part for efficient CO2 capture by physical adsorption and CO2-phobic Mg(OH)2 part for massive CO2 storage by chemical reaction. Our rst-principles calculations on Mg(OH)2 monolayer further suggest that doping and charge be additional approaches to adjust the CO2-phobicity of Mg(OH)2.47"

This work expands the design space, offering new opportunities for the development of enhanced and cost-effective CO2 adsorbents based on magnesium minerals. This expansion includes transitioning from the binary MgO\u2013H2O system to ternary MgO\u2013H2O\u2013MgX or even quaternary MgO\u2013H2O\u2013MgX1\u2013MgX2 systems.
