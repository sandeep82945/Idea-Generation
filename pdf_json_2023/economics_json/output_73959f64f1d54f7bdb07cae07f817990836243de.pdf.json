    "abstractText": "Received Aug 31, 2021 Revised Aug 03, 2022 Accepted Aug 18, 2022 In mitigating the peak demand, the energy authority in Malaysia has introduced the enhanced time of use (EToU). However, the number of participants joining the programs is less than expected. Due to that reason, this study investigated the investment benefit in terms of electricity cost reduction when consumers subscribe to the EToU tariff scheme. The significant consumers from industrial tariff types have been focused on where the load profiles were collected from the incoming providers\u2019 power stations. Meanwhile, ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are applied to optimize the load profiles reflecting EToU tariff prices. The proposed method had shown a reduction in electricity cost, and the most significant performance has been recorded congruently. For a maximum 30% load adjustment using ACO optimization, the electricity costs have been decreased by 10% (D type of tariff), 16% (E1 type of tariff), 9% (E2 kind of tariff), and 1.13% (E3 type of tariff) when compared to the existing conventional tariff. The cost-benefit of the EToU tariff switching has been identified where the simple payback period (SPP) is below one year for all the industrial types of consumers.",

            "text": "The increasing electricity demand contributes to energy generation to increase CO2 gas emissions. In recent data founding, it was reported that 84% of CO2 emissions are contributed by industrial/manufacturing activities [1], [2]. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic promotes lockdown among energy consumers, CO2 emissions are reduced in line with the energy demand decreased from the industry sectors. However, the long-term and economic benefits in terms of demand-side management (DSM) should be considered so that future planning would consider the economic and financial aspects of many related consumers programs towards load management [3]. Thus, DSM programs should be introduced to reduce the impact of peak demand and the power system generation tension; the demand response program and energy efficiency for the post pandemic COVID-19 [4]. In 2022, there has been an upsurge in electricity peak demand in Malaysia since the colossal development and industrial process are restarted to operate where electricity tariff switching is available. Since 1995, the government has purposely implemented the time of use (ToU) tariff scheme to commercial and industrial consumers by promoting the load shifting where the energy price for off-peak hours is cheaper for about 20% compared to the flat tariff price. However, the ToU\n ISSN: 1693-6930\nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control, Vol. 21, No. 1, February 2023: 203-213\n204\nscheme has a maximum demand charge that is still high compared to the conventional flat tariff. Concerning the issue, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) has introduced a more advanced tariff, namely the enhanced time of used (EToU) tariff scheme, in 2016. The EToU tariff scheme offers a more flexible tariff time zone with three energy prices for peak, off-peak, and mid-peak and two prices for maximum demand in peak and mid-peak allocation. Nevertheless, it was reported that only 1% of the consumers joined the scheme. Meanwhile, the others refused to participate due to being less confident to apply the load management strategies [5]. It is also related to the provider\u2019s less promotion where the consumers have little knowledge of how to take load management action.\nSince there, the researchers have investigated the issues and tried to help the consumers by proposing\nthe techniques required to enjoy cost benefits from the EToU tariff scheme. As presented in [6], [7], industrial and commercial consumers\u2019 load profile was investigated to reflect the EToU tariff scheme compared to the ToU tariff. As for standard load shifting implementation, the consumers need to adjust the load for about ~30 to 70% to enjoy energy consumption cost reduction compared to flat and ToU tariff schemes. Since the application of the evolutionary algorithm is excellent in solving many complex problems, especially in power system study, Azman et al. [7] have promoted the evolutionary algorithm (EA) to find the optimum load profile for specific commercial consumers by adopting EToU tariff prices. The energy consumption cost was reduced at all six-segmentation zones of the peak, mid-peak, and off-peak when the load adjustment was put for about 50%. The optimum load management weightage differed depending on the consumers\u2019 load profile and the business activities dealing with the cost reduction under the EToU tariff scheme, as explained in [8]. The authors have adopted particle swarm optimization (PSO) to manage the simultaneous DSM strategies formulation (peak clipping, valley filling, and load shifting) to deal with six-segments of EToU tariff price.\nIn conjution to the DSM technique application to deal with ToU tariff design around the world,\nRehman et al. [9] and Makroum et al. [10] has applied the load shifting from high-peak hours to low-peak hours concurrently with the adoption of optimization algorithms, namely bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and genetic algorithm (GA). As the application of the optimization algorithm is superior results, analysis of the effect of ToU tariff and maximum demand on the power exchange of the power grid can be done strategically [11], [12]. Ultimately, in [13], the optimization algorithm and optimal DSM strategy formulation to reflect the EToU tariff scheme have been used to optimize the load profile to reduce the electricity price and maximum demand in peninsular Malaysia. Meanwhile, Shaari et al. [14] use EToU tariff and ToU tariff prices for a chiller plant operation to optimize the cost of the process. As the significant energy user in most commercial buildings, the chiller plant operation electricity cost optimization would benefit private consumers and government agencies.\nIn the EToU tariff scheme study, the optimization algorithm\u2019s application was less focused on past\nstudies, mainly for implementing the optimal DSM strategy to the specific consumers. Meanwhile, the cost-benefit of the investment to switch the conventional tariff to EToU tariff has also less been presented in the area of study. Therefore, this study proposed an investigation of the cost-benefit under the EToU tariff scheme, which applies the ant colony optimization (ACO) and PSO algorithms while reflecting load management strategy under the demand response program in Malaysia. ACO algorithm is famously known to be a probabilistic algorithm used to find an approximately optimal solution through an ant colony-inspired process [15]. Artificial ants or simulation agents search for the most straightforward solution by moving through parameter space. The agents record their location and solutions that will later be spread to other agents to find the best solutions among all of the information gathered [16]. ACO is selected in this study because it performs a model-based search and is similar to estimating distribution algorithm [17]. In conjunction with that, the PSO introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart [18] will be the baseline performance algorithm to compare with ACO algorithm performance. Those comparisons purposely test the load profile from all categories under the industrial tariff offered by TNB in peninsular Malaysia. Since the simultaneously DSM strategies have been applied by previous studies for commercial buildings, investigating appropriateness to industrial consumers is essential to prove that the EToU tariff scheme could be used by massive segmentation of industrial consumers.\nHence, the paper\u2019s arrangement is considered as: section 2 presents the formulation and tariff structure\nmethodology while covering the implementation of the PSO and ACO algorithms. Next, the simulation case study, results, and discussion are presented in section 3. Meanwhile, section 4 concludes the findings and recommendations for future research."

            "text": "Ant colony optimization algorithm is an optimization technique used to solve problems through\ngraphs. This optimization method is developed based on the behavior of a colony of ants. The paradigm used in this optimization is based on the communication of biological ants through pheromone-based communication [19], [20]. The ants travel in search of food and leave trails of pheromones and attract other ants to follow the trails, which is why ants always travel in a line. The more pheromones laid out on the path, more ants will follow the path, and that path will be the best solution to the problem faced. In the ACO algorithm, two processes are involved: generating the ants process and updating the pheromones process. A new set of ants will be generated in each iteration respective to the desired nodes in the first process. The probability of ant to select a node is expressed in (15).\np(\u03b1ij|Sp)= rij \u03b1\u00d7\u03b7 ij\n\u03b2\n\u2211 rij \u03b1\u00d7\u03b7\nij\n\u03b2 (15)\nWhere, \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57|\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d) is the probability that the limit \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 will be selected in with the partial solution \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 is the node \ud835\udc56 to node \ud835\udc57 limit.

The \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 is a heuristic value, or the inverse of the cost of going through limit \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57. Meanwhile, \ud835\udefc is the importance factor of pheromone and \ud835\udefd is the importance factor of heuristic.\nAfter the trails have been updated after the ants have completed their solution, updating pheromone\nprocess will start. In this process, the level of shifted pheromone is determined. The escalating value of pheromone in trails leave by ants will restrain the connecting nodes it has used. There are also cases of decreasing pheromone level due to evaporation process. In (16) and (17) presents the process of updating pheromone evaporation and reinforcement accordingly.\nrij=(1-\u03c1)\u00d7rij (16)\nWhere, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 is the value pheromone at the limit ranging from i to j. \ud835\udf0c is the pheromone evaporation factor\nrij=rij+ \u2211 \u2206rij (17)\nWhere \u2211 \u2206\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 is the pheromone that will be added by an ant to the trail, that rely on the length of the trail that used by the ants.

The ants expressing a possible initial load profile set to identify each electricity energy cost change or the\nalgorithm are called nodes in 24-hour time. In the next step, the fitness values obtained is used.\nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control \nAppropriateness of EToU electricity tariff program for ... (Mohamad Fani Sulaima)\n207\n\u2212 Step 2: the constraints is formulated, and the cost is identified. The pheromone values that have been updated will be engaged in the EToU formulation in form of MD cost and the DSM strategy as in (2) until (12)\naccordingly. The best cost value in the first process in ACO is chosen from the latest update of total electricity cost in six-time segmentation. The second process of finding the updated ants\u2019 pheromones will start after the first process of ACO is done.\n\u2212 Step 3: the best cost value obtained during updating the pheromones are used to determine the best total energy cost covering all segmentations, while the ideal load profile represented by the best ants is\ndeveloped. Once again, (16) and (17) are applied in this step.\n\u2212 Step 4: after the requirements for the best cost have been achieved, to satisfy the constraints, the achieved value of cost is concluded to be convergence value. If the condition is not yet fulfilled, the process will\nbegin all over again to find the new possible setting of ants list. In this step, the contribution of electricity energy cost and MD cost to the assistance of LFI is generated."

            "heading": "4. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "The electricity cost has been successfully reduced by applying the simultaneous demand side strategies and implementing the optimization of ACO and PSO algorithms. The proposed simultaneous DSM strategies have shifted the peak usage of industrial D, E1, E2, and E3 load profiles to off-peak zones based on the six-segmentation of EToU electricity tariff. The valley filling strategies have changed the load profile load curve by filling in the off-peak zones. The load clipping and load shifting have successfully reduced the peak consumptions and shift them to off-peak zones. As a result, the maximum demand in the baseline cases has been shifted to mid-peak zones, contributing to the decrease in electricity bill cost. Other than that, the performance of optimization algorithms, ACO, and PSO has been analyzed, and the ability to handle the energy load profile makes it easier for the optimization process. PSO algorithms were found more efficient in reducing the price of electricity while using the EToU tariff rates. From the analysis, the D tariff users should remain using the flatt tariff as the electricity usage and price are cheaper. Meanwhile, for E1, E2 and E3, they should change to EToU tariff. But the users need to carefully manage their load profile to utilize the benefits from EToU tariff fully. As for future research recommendations, the study would be extended to define the available load that could contribute to the more specific load management strategies."
