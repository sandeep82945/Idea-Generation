 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the link between early-life postural changes (lying lateral vs sternal) and sow behavior in the farrowing crate to see if posture predicts restlessness, savaging, or crushing tendencies. This could help select for more docile mothering behaviors. 

2. Conduct a larger study with more farrowing records to validate the relationships found between early activity traits and reproductive outcomes like gestation length, piglets born alive, and piglets weaned.

3. Investigate the underlying physiological or genetic differences between sows that prefer lying lateral vs sternal postures to better understand the antagonistic effects on reproduction. 

4. Incorporate NUtrack activity traits into selection indexes for breeding programs to see if they improve genetic progress for reproductive traits when appropriately weighted. 

5. Explore if certain activity profiles measured by NUtrack can serve as early indicators of lameness or other health issues to improve culling decisions and sow longevity.
