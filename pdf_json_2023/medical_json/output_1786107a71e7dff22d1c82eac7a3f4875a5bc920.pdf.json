    "abstractText": "ADAMTS12 is a gene widely expressed in human tissues. We studied the expression level of ADAMTS12 in cervical cancer tissue and its relationship with clinicopathological features. We also explored the function of ADAMTS12 in cervical cancer cells and its underlying mechanisms. We found the higher expression level of ADAMTS12 in cancer tissues, which was associated with the worse overall survival rate. The immunofluorescence assay showed that the cytoplasm of cervical cancer cells is the main expression site of ADAMTS12. Overexpression of ADAMTS12 in HeLa and CaSki cells prominently promoted the cell proliferation, migration and invasion. We found that 2032 genes were correlated with ADAMTS12, which was mainly related to extracellular matrix, TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. The phosphorylation levels of mTOR and 4E-BP1 were upregulated in ADAMTS12-overexpressing cells. Co-Immunoprecipitation combined with protein mass spectrometry showed that TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway-related proteins interacting with ADAMTS12 were screened from HeLa cells with ADAMTS12 overexpression. Therefore, we concluded that ADAMTS12 may affect the mTOR signaling pathway through the interacting with TGF-\u03b21, and then affect the biological function of cervical cancer cells.",

ADAMTS12, a member of the ADAMTS family, located in 5q35 of the human gene with a length of about 8572\u00a0bp and a predicted protein molecular size of about 177\u00a0kDa. Its structure includes: signal peptide, prodomain, catalytic domain, disintegrin-like domain, TSP1 like repeat sequence, cysteine-rich domain, the two spacers and the C-terminal TSP1-like repeat sequence [5\u20138]. In 2001, ADAMTS12 was first reported and has since been widely\nRuanmin Zou and Ruihong Gu equally contributed to this work.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s12672- 023- 00776-2.\n* Ruanmin Zou, beryl@wmu.edu.cn; * Wensu Li, lws161@163.com; * Yuyang Zhang, zhangyuyang@wmu.edu.cn | 1Department of\u00a0Obstetrics and\u00a0Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, People\u2019s\u00a0Republic\u00a0of\u00a0China. 2Department of\u00a0Microbiology and\u00a0Immunology, Institute of\u00a0Molecular Virology and\u00a0Immunology, Institute of\u00a0Tropical Medicine, College of\u00a0Basic Medicine, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, People\u2019s\u00a0Republic\u00a0of\u00a0China. 3Department of\u00a0Gynecology, Tongde Hospital of\u00a0Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, People\u2019s\u00a0Republic\u00a0of\u00a0China.\nVol:.(1234567890)\n1 3\nstudied. ADAMTS12 has been confirmed to be expressed in a variety of human tissues [6] and plays a significant role in the pathological process of various diseases, such as tumor [8], inflammation [9, 10], arthritis [11, 12], intervertebral disc degeneration [13], angiogenesis [14], schizophrenia [15], and gonadal development [16]. In terms of tumor, the potential biological properties of ADAMTS12 are various in different tumors. In breast cancer, ADAMTS12 can suppress tumorigenesis when interacts with fibulin-2, its chaperone protein, but can also promote tumor development if fibulin-2 is absent [17]. ADAMTS12 has the effect of inhibiting colorectal cancer. It\u2019s silent in cancer cells, but is activated in cancer stroma which may have the anti-tumor mechanism [18]. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, ADAMTS12 is one of the downstream regulatory targets of lncRNA HCG22, which plays a role in suppressing cancer progression [19]. In ovarian cancer, ADAMTS12 was overexpressed in intestinal metastatic tissues, suggesting that the high expression of ADAMTS12 gene predicts the occurrence of intestinal metastasis and invasive cancer [20]. The expression of ADAMTS12 gene was also significantly upregulated in metastatic carcinoma of renal cell carcinoma [21].\nCervical cancer is a common malignant gynecological tumor, but it is unclear whether ADAMTS12 is related to cervical carcinogenesis. In this research, we explored the relationship between the expression level of ADAMTS12 in cervical cancer tissues and clinicopathological characteristics, and verified that ADAMTS12 is an independent risk factor influencing the prognosis of cervical cancer patients. The malignant phenotype of ADAMTS12 in cervical cancer cell lines was verified by functional experiments. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore the biological processes that ADAMTS12 may be involved in. The association between ADAMTS12 and immune indicators was analyzed, and it was found that ADAMTS12 may play an oncogenic role via the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. In addition, ADAMTS12 regulated the malignant function of cervical cancer, which may also be related to B cells and macrophages. This article provides a preliminary basis for studying the mechanism of ADAMTS12 in cervical cancer, and it also suggests a new direction for gene therapy of cervical cancer, and proposes a theoretical basis for ADAMTS12 gene as a therapeutic target for cervical cancer."

ADAMTS12 level was used as the dividing standard. We utilized\nVol:.(1234567890)\n1 3\nROC curve to choose the cut-off point to divide patients into two groups, high expression group and low expression group. We found significant differences in OS between the two groups of high and low expression (P = 0.009), and the higher expression level of ADAMTS12, the worse the prognosis (Fig.\u00a01E), which was in line with the analysis results of TCGA database. Our data showed that a significant association was found between ADAMTS12 level and pathological type (P = 0.012), most patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) expressed low ADAMTS12, while in non-cervical squamous cell carcinoma that was high.\nADAMTS12 level was strongly correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.007). ADAMTS12 level was low in most patients with early cervical cancer (CIS + I), but high in most patients with stage II\u2013IV, suggesting that the ADAMTS12 level increases with the progression of cervical cancer. Moreover, the level of ADAMTS12 was closely connected with the differentiation state of tumors (P = 0.004). Most of the patients with highly differentiated cervical carcinoma expressed low level of ADAMTS12, while most of the patients with poorly differentiated cervical carcinoma expressed a high level of ADAMTS12. There was also a noteworthy correlation between ADAMTS12 level and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (P < 0.001). Compared with patients without adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the proportion of patients with high ADAMTS12 level was higher in patients requiring adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The proportion of patients that received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with high levels of ADAMTS12 was even higher.

In comparison with the control group, ADAMTS12 protein was significantly expressed in the experimental group (Fig.\u00a02A).\nADAMTS12 protein was deeply expressed at 230 KDa band, and weakly expressed at 178 KDa bands. Considered that the protein might be glycosylated, we utilized glycosylated enzyme according to the band position of HA labeled antibody. Afterwards, WB showed that in experimental group 230 KDa decreased significantly close to the 178 KDa band (Fig.\u00a02B). The results suggest that ADAMTS12 can be successfully overexpressed in\u00a0vitro cervical cancer cells, and ADAMTS12 may be modified in\u00a0vitro, resulting in protein molecular weight increase. In order to figure out subcellular localization of ADAMTS12 overexpression in\u00a0vitro, cell immunofluorescence assay was used. Plasmids pCMV-HA and pCMV-adamts12-HA were transfected into cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and CaSki), respectively. The results displayed that ADAMTS12 was mainly located in cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a02C)."

Their molecular function is mainly to bind actin and participate in formation of extracellular matrix. The most abundant biological processes are involved in tissue formation of extracellular structure and extracellular matrix, which are closely related to the function of promoting cervical cancer cell migration in\u00a0vitro. We introduced the above-mentioned 2032 related genes into HALLMARK data set for GSEA analysis. After sequencing all pathways according to gene proportion, the pathways with P > 0.05 were removed, and the top 20 pathways in the sequencing table were selected, mainly including transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a04F).

The molecular expression level and phosphorylation levels of PI3K, mTOR, and 4EBP1D proteins in cervical cancer cells with the ADAMTS12 overexpression group were detected by WB. The results showed that upregulation of ADAMTS12 expression significantly upregulated the levels of phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 in HeLa cells (Fig.\u00a05C, D).

            "text": "ADAMTS12 has been extensively studied since it was first reported. Previous studies revealed that ADAMTS12 has a great biological role in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and other different tumors. We have reason to speculate that ADAMTS12 may play a significant role in cervical cancer, so it is necessary to study the role of this gene in cervical cancer. For this study, the clinical data of cervical cancer patients in TCGA database were analyzed. ADAMTS12 level increased gradually with the progression of the disease, and higher expression level was interrelated with shorter survival and recurrence survival. We detected the expression level of ADAMTS12 gene in cervical cancer tissues and normal cervical tissues by immunohistochemistry, and found that the expression level of ADAMTS12 gene in cervical cancer tissues was evidently higher than that in normal cervical tissues, and the analysis results of 382 cervical cancer microarray also suggested that the high expression level of ADAMTS12 predicted a poorer prognosis.\nTherefore, we further explored the relationship between ADAMTS12 and cervical cancer phenotype. Previous studies have found that some factors may affect the prognosis of cervical cancer, such as FIGO stage [27], degree of differentiation [28], lymph node metastasis [28, 29], radiotherapy and chemotherapy [30], pathological types [31], are considered prognostic factors for cervical cancer and are widely used in research. We found a relationship between ADAMTS12 expression levels and the clinicopathological features of cervical cancer, which confirmed our previous inference, and we conducted further studies on its predictive ability. First, we analyzed ADAMTS12 levels in 382 cervical cancer patients and found that ADAMTS12 levels were higher in tumors with a higher degree of malignancy, including patients with high FIGO stage, poorly differentiated status, and pathological type of non-squamous cell carcinoma. The higher FIGO stage was the result of tumor progression, which is consistent with the conclusion that ADAMTS12 levels increase with tumor progression, suggesting that ADAMTS12 has the potential to predict tumor progression. In addition, ADAMST12 levels also increased in cervical cancer tissues of patients receiving adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Although whether a patient received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy was not a result of tumor progression, it indirectly implied tumor malignancy, as patients with higher malignancy were more likely to receive combined chemoradiation. Although these analyses suggest that ADAMTS12 levels may predict tumor malignancy, it cannot be determined whether ADAMTS12 is directly related to tumor malignancy or indirectly related to tumors due to factors such as stage, differentiation, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, multiple regression analysis was needed to determine whether ADAMTS12 level was an independent risk factor.\nClinical indicators such as FIGO stage, tumor differentiation type, and lymph node metastasis have been used by scholars to establish clinical prediction models, and the constructed clinical prediction models can predict the 5-year survival rate of cervical cancer patients [32\u201334]. In this study, we examined whether the expression level of ADAMTS12 could be a new independent risk predictor. We used Cox hazard proportional regression model for analysis, ADAMTS12 level, FIGO stage, tumor differentiation type, lymph node metastasis, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment, and pathological type were all used as potential covariates to participate in univariate Cox regression analysis. The results displayed that all these factors, except pathological type, had a significant association with survival and were used for multiple regression analysis. But considering the importance of pathological type in clinical diagnosis and prognosis, pathological type was also included in multiple regression analysis. Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that ADAMST12 level was an independent risk factor for cervical cancer (HR = 2.339 (1.026\u20135.333, P = 0.043), which could be used as a clinical predictor.\nAccording to the ADAMTS12 gene sequence in NCBI database, pCMV was selected as the vector to construct the overexpression plasmid. To verify the cancer-promoting phenotype of ADAMTS12 in experiments, we selected HeLa and CaSki to conduct cell functional experiments. After transfection with ADAMTS12 plasmid, the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells were significantly enhanced, but the cloning and proliferation ability were not affected. These results\nVol.:(0123456789)\nare consistent with expectations, confirming that exogenous overexpression of ADAMTS12 can promote the malignant phenotype of cervical cancer cells.\nNext, we screened 353 interacting proteins, including TGF-\u03b21 protein, by up-regulating ADAMTS12 gene in HeLa cells and performing co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry analysis. At present, studies have shown that in the early stage of tumorigenesis, TGF-\u03b2 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to inhibit the occurrence and growth of primary tumors. In the late stage of tumor progression, when the tumor cytokine TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway is inactivated or the cell cycle is abnormally regulated and becomes resistant to the growth inhibition of TGF-\u03b2, the effect of TGF-\u03b2 has a pro-tumor effect.\nTo explore the cancer-promoting mechanism of ADAMTS12, we first began to search through the bioinformatics level. We downloaded sequencing data from the TCGA database. To search for genes closely related to ADAMTS12, 2032 genes were obtained by using the spearman method and statistical processing with R version 3.6.3. GO analysis of these genes showed that the main enriched biological processes were extracellular structure organization and extracellular matrix, which were closely related to their function of promoting the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells in\u00a0vitro. In addition, through GSEA enrichment analysis, the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway was enriched. Therefore, we speculate that ADAMTS12 may affect TGF-\u03b21 expression to participate in the progression of cervical cancer [24\u201326, 35].\nAccording to the transcriptome sequencing after ADAMTS12 gene upregulated in HeLa cells, results suggested that 225 genes were upregulated and 289 genes were downregulated. These differential genes were enriched to PI3K/ mTOR signaling pathway by KEGG analysis. Since PI3K is downstream of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, we speculated that ADMTS12 might affect the downstream signaling pathway through interacting with TGF-\u03b2. PI3K signaling pathway plays a key role in many biological and cellular processes, such as cell invasion, migration, and angiogenesis [22, 36, 37]. Several key molecules of PI3K signaling pathway were detected. Under the action of upstream factors, P13K is activated and acts on its substrate PIP2, resulting in its phosphorylation to PIP3, thereby activating mTOR to play its role. The activated mTOR can then lead to the phosphorylation of its downstream translation-inhibiting molecule 4E-BP1, thus promoting protein translation and other synthesis processes, leading to affecting the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cells [23]. Our study found that ADAMTS12 overexpression in cervical cancer cells upregulated the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and 4E-BP1. Therefore, we speculated that ADAMTS12 activates the PI3K signaling pathway by interacting with proteins in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, and then plays a carcinogenic role in cervical cancer. However, there are still many deficiencies in this study. For example, the results of mass spectrometry were not verified by the WB experiment, and whether the glycosylation of ADAMTS12 protein affects the biological function of tumor will be our possible direction of follow-up research.\nADAMTS12-related protein is highly associated with the matrix, which also suggests that the function of ADAMTS12 in tumors may require the cooperation of other matrix components, such as fibroblasts, immune cells, etc. In addition, ADAMTS12 is also a key mediator in the process of inflammation [38], so we chose to analyze the relativity between ADAMTS12 and immune cells. We select non-specific immune cells, CD20 + B cells, CD57 + NK cells, CD68 + M cells, CD163 + M2 cells. The correlation between 4 immune cells and ADAMTS12 was analyzed by Pearson. ADAMTS12 was positively correlated with CD20 + B cells, CD68 + M cells, CD163 + M2 cells. These results also suggest that ADAMTS12 may promote cancer progression by affecting the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and 4E-BP1 in the PI3K signaling pathway, and then induce the infiltration of B cells, macrophages, and other immune cells. TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway has been known to affect immune system to promote cervical cancer development [39, 40]. Therefore, ADAMTS12 could affect the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and immune cells via interacting with TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway.\nIn conclusion, this study shows that ADAMTS12 gene is closely related to migration and invasion ability of cervical cancer, and can be used as an indicator of poor prognosis of patients. Further, upregulation of ADAMTS12 gene can affect mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting that the ADAMTS12 gene can provide a new target for diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer. It also provides a fresh idea and direction for the study of tumor metastasis and invasion.\nAcknowledgements We thank college of Basic Medicine of Wenzhou Medical University for support on this manuscript.\nAuthor contributions RZ and XT wrote the manuscript and performed statistical analyses.
