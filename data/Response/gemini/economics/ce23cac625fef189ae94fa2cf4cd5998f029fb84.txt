1. **Investigate the impact of opportunity co-creation on entrepreneurial performance in different cultural contexts.** The study in the paper was conducted in China, and it would be interesting to see if the results hold true in other countries with different cultural norms and values.
2. **Examine the role of government support in opportunity co-creation.** The study found that government support can play a significant role in opportunity co-creation, but it is not clear what specific types of support are most effective. Future research could investigate this question in more detail.
3. **Explore the relationship between opportunity co-creation and other forms of entrepreneurship.** The study focused on opportunity co-creation in the context of poverty reduction, but it is possible that opportunity co-creation could also be beneficial in other forms of entrepreneurship, such as social entrepreneurship or corporate entrepreneurship.
4. **Investigate the long-term effects of opportunity co-creation.** The study did not examine the long-term effects of opportunity co-creation, but it is possible that these effects could be significant. Future research could follow up with entrepreneurs who have participated in opportunity co-creation programs to see how their businesses have performed over time.
5. **Develop a model of opportunity co-creation.** The study provides a conceptual framework for understanding opportunity co-creation, but it does not develop a formal model. Future research could develop a more formal model that could be used to predict the outcomes of opportunity co-creation programs.
