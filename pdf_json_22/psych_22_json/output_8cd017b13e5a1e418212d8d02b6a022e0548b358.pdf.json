This study investigates the environment factors that influence college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention as mediated by personality traits.\nMethods: According to the entrepreneurial ecosystem theory, a hierarchical model of the environment factors was established which included three layers: personality traits as the micro system, family and education as the meso system, and social and policy support as the macro system. The structural equation model of the environment factors was constructed to reveal the significant influence path of various factors and the mediating role of personality traits. Data were collected from 436 undergraduate students in Henan Province, China.\nResults: Findings indicate that family, education, social, and policy factors have no significant direct influence on entrepreneurial intention. However, personality traits significantly influence entrepreneurial intention and mediate the e ects of various factors on entrepreneurial intention.\nDiscussion: Suggestions such as improving college students\u2019 entrepreneurial practice and promoting college students\u2019 proactive personalities are also put forward.\nKEYWORDS\nentrepreneurial intention, college students, environment factors, personality traits, mediating e ect\nIntroduction\nExtant entrepreneurship studies agree that some characteristics of college students indeed promote their entrepreneurial intention such as self-efficacy (Arshad et al., 2016), risk-taking (Zhang et al., 2015), positive attitude (Yang et al., 2015), and others. The entrepreneurial ecosystem theory, which stems from the social ecosystem theory, attaches great importance to the interaction between humans and the environment and the effect of the environment on individual behavior. The theory primarily emphasizes the joint influence of family, education, and society on individual growth and behavior (Davies et al., 2005). However, there remains a lack of research application research of this thought on the field of entrepreneurship. The environment is rarely studied as\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nthe context factor of entrepreneurship (Bignotti and Roux, 2016). Cornerstone studies on the entrepreneurial environment include the five-dimension model proposed by Gnyawali and Fogel (1994) and the global entrepreneurship observation (GEM) study (Amor\u00f3s and Bosma, 2014). Despite this, mechanisms explaining how the external environment affects the entrepreneurial intention largely remains understood as a \u201cblack box\u201d; many even doubt whether entrepreneurship can be feasibly taught.\n\u201cMass entrepreneurship and innovation\u201d has become an important driving force of Chinese economic reform. However, only a very small fraction (0.4%) of Chinese college graduates started their own businesses in 2008. This has led to the Chinese Ministry of Education vigorously promoting innovation and entrepreneurship education and the entrepreneurial activities of college students since 2010 (Ministry of Education of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2010). Consequently, the entrepreneurship rate increased to 2.9% (Mycos Institute, 2017). The entrepreneurship rate of Chinese college students also remains very low, especially given the negative impact of COVID-19 in early 2020. In 2021, 1.2% of undergraduate students (Mycos Institute, 2022a) and 3.1% of vocational college students (Mycos Institute, 2022b) chose to start their own businesses. This is alarmingly low compared with the global average entrepreneurship rate of college students of about 20%.\nThus, it is necessary to reflect on the effect of environmental factors on entrepreneurial intention. Some studies only analyze one or several factors, but there remains a lack of a reliable framework between the factors. Although some scholars have divided the influencing factors into different layers (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Zastrow and Kirst-Ashman, 2012), the influence of the environment on entrepreneurial intention remains to be given commensurate scholarly attention. Therefore, this study attempts to explore the mechanism of environmental factors on the entrepreneurial intention of Chinese college students during the outbreak of COVID-19 using a structural equation model. It does so by dividing the environment into three layers: micro-system, meso-system, and macro-system. The micro-system refers to the individual in this system such as personality traits in the entrepreneurial environment. The meso-system refers to the small group system such as the family and education. Finally, the macro-system refers to the broader cultural and social system such as social support and policy support."

Bird (1988) was the first to propose the concept of \u201centrepreneurial intention\u201d where individuals pay attention to or even commit to setting up a new\ncompany or realizing the new value of an existing company. Bae et al. (2014) defined it as an individual\u2019s desire to find a business, while Phan et al. (2002) defined it as the possibility of choosing to launch a business.\nEntrepreneurial intention (EI) is often expressed through entrepreneurial willingness or entrepreneurial tendency. It is seen as the subjective attitude of individuals to devote themselves to entrepreneurial practice. Entrepreneurial intention is also the premise of entrepreneurial behavior (Krueger and Brazeal, 1994) and subsequently plays a crucial role in predicting entrepreneurial behavior."

Entrepreneurial intention is, therefore, positively affected by the success of the parents\u2019 business and by parents acting as role models for their children (Davide et al., 2021). Entrepreneurship education in American universities is categorized into three groups: the education about enterprise, education for enterprise, and education in enterprise (Jamieson, 1984). There are also various entrepreneurial models, including magnet mode, radiation mode, and mixed mode. Currently, entrepreneurship education remains to be the primary mode in China, which is mainly based on the entrepreneurship theory."

Personality traits are pivotal as to whether an individual can become an entrepreneur (Hu et al., 2018). However, Gartner (1985) showed no significant correlation between personality traits and entrepreneurial intention, while Wagner and Sternberg (2004) showed that entrepreneurial intention is influenced by both personality traits and environmental factors.\nThe mediating role of personality traits\nStudies have focused on the direct effect of various factors on entrepreneurial intention. Nonetheless, the intermediate mechanism of how they transform to entrepreneurial performance remains to be thoroughly studied, which has been regarded as a \u201cblack box\u201d (Maritz and Brown, 2013). Proactive personality, as first proposed by Bateman and Crant (1993), is a stable tendency for individuals to proactively influence their surroundings. College students with higher levels of proactive personality identify entrepreneurial opportunities more actively, seek alliances and supporters to support individual initiative behavior, contact with influential and high-quality resources, pursue innovative strategies, and obtain better financing (Thompson, 2005). This allows them to develop the ability to quickly identify, obtain, and use external resources (Hulsink et al., 2008). Accordingly, entrepreneurial self-confidence and entrepreneurial ability are improved, in turn urging them to take positive actions, make use of the identified opportunities, realize entrepreneurship, and seek entrepreneurial success (Krueger and Brazeal, 1994). Hence, this study posits the existence of a mediating role of personality traits between entrepreneurial factors and entrepreneurial intention.\nIn addition, as the indirect environmental factors, entrepreneurship policies and social support also impact personality traits, further affecting entrepreneurial intention."

Then, the TPB was brought into consideration, followed by the formation of a myriad of models (Ajzen, 1991). The entrepreneurial ecosystem reveals the impact of family, university, and society on the entrepreneurial intention of college students (Davies et al., 2005). However, the influence mechanism of the environment on entrepreneurial intention is blurry. Zastrow and Kirst-Ashman (2012) divided the influencing factors into three layers: macro-, meso-, and micro-systems. The study followed Zastrow et al.\u2019s method to divide the influencing factors of entrepreneurial intention (EI). The micro-system includes personality traits (PT). The meso-system includes family support (FS) and education support (ES), promoting the entrepreneurial intention directly, and the macro-system includes policy support (PS) and social support (SS), thus indirectly influencing the entrepreneurial intention. Moreover, personality traits are proposed to play an intermediary role.\nBased on the existing research, this study constructs the conceptual model. By the structural equation model, this study establishes the path of various factors on the entrepreneurial intention of college students to analyze the significant influencing factors, as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, several research hypotheses are put forward.\nHypothesis 1: Family support has a significant impact on college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention.

Entrepreneurship policies included an incubation policy (Schwarz et al., 2009), loan discount policy, industrial and commercial tax relief policy, tax relief policy, site fee reduction policy, and project funding policy. Social support includes social investment, public opinion environment, technology environment, and economic environment (Pereverzeva, 2015). Family support included parental support, parents\u2019 own business, friends\u2019 support, friends\u2019 own business, and local cultural support (Koch et al., 2015). Education support includes knowledge, skills, entrepreneurship courses, entrepreneurial projects, and teacher encouragement (Nowin\u0301ski et al., 2017).\n(3) Mediating variable (personality traits): Following Ismail et al.

The factor analysis is shown in Table 1, and six factors are obtained after rotation; the cumulative contribution rate of exceeding variance is 68.13%, and the load value of each observation variable is higher than 0.7, with at least three items per factor (Hair et al., 2010).\nFor reliability, Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of the total questionnaire is 0.925, and the value of every factor is higher than 0.70 (Hair et al., 2010).

The value of the standard error of the estimated value (S.E.) in Table 4 is relatively small, indicating that the sample is closer to the total parameter. The value of critical ratio (C.R.) was used to calculate P. Clearly, the five paths indicate significance (p< 0.05), whereas two paths have no significance (p > 0.05).\nImpact of family support on entrepreneurial intention\nIt was found that family support is not significantly influence entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2 = 0.056, P = 0.264 > 0.05), which means that hypothesis 1 is not supported. This is consistent with existing results (Gimenez et al., 2015). In fact, family support and friend support are critical for college students to establish self-confidence, encouragement, and financial support (Baughn et al., 2006). This may be connected to the low willingness to start a business. There may be other reasons, which need further exploration. The characteristics of family norms, values, and resources could impact new venture creation (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003). This is especially true under the influence of Chinese Confucianism, where many parents hope their children get jobs in the government system and stable incomes and high social status. On the other hand, the risk of entrepreneurship is also higher. Moreover, regional personality plays a crucial role in the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem (Zhou et al., 2021). The college students in this study mainly come fromHenan Province, which is located in central China, where the local economy relatively lags behind. Therefore, the family support turns out to be not significant.\nThe impact of education support on entrepreneurial intention\nEducation support does not significantly influence entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2 = 0.044, P = 0.265 > 0.05), thus rejecting hypothesis 2. This result is unique to the Chinese experience; in fact, the training, projects, and practice have significant impacts on college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention in existing studies. This closely relates to the recent national innovation and entrepreneurship education on college students. With the continuous growth of economics and jobs (Thurik et al., 2012), entrepreneurship education has become the focus of attention for universities, researchers, and the government (Kuratko, 2005). By contrast, college students are unsatisfied with present entrepreneurship education, which relies on short-term training or professional education before employment in China. Therefore, it is still necessary to focus on the cultivation of entrepreneurial abilities and improve the effect of entrepreneurship education in universities. In China, entrepreneurship education should go beyond traditional examination-oriented teaching styles and focus on promoting proactive personality and creativity (Hu et al., 2018).\nThe impact of personality traits on entrepreneurial intention\nPersonality traits influence entrepreneurial intention significantly, which supports hypothesis 3 (\u03b2 = 0.954, P < 0.001).

Interestingly, policy support and education support do not significantly affect entrepreneurial intention directly but do have significant impacts on personality traits. Essentially, personality traits play a mediating role. Therefore, entrepreneurship intention should be based on a clear understanding of students\u2019 personality characteristics, core qualities, key competencies, and innovation.\nThe impact of family support on entrepreneurial intention\nFamily support significantly influences personality traits (\u03b2 = 0.226, P < 0.05), and personality traits likewise significantly influence entrepreneurial intention. Thus, hypothesis 4 is supported. Various factors influence college students\u2019 personality traits, including optimism, self-confidence, innovativeness, risk-taking propensity, leadership (Embi et al., 2019), economic support (Suratno et al., 2021), entrepreneurial experience, self-confidence, creativity, and alertness (Baron, 2004). Along with the aforementioned analysis, personality traits indeed play a mediating role in family support on entrepreneurial intention.\nThe impact of education support on entrepreneurial intention\nEducation support significantly influences personality traits (\u03b2=\u22120.145, P < 0.05). The results indicate the significant effect of personality traits on entrepreneurial intention and further reveal the internal influence mechanism of education support on entrepreneurial intention. Thus, hypothesis 5 is confirmed. Entrepreneurship education promotes entrepreneurial intention by cultivating college students\u2019 self-efficacy, anticipatory thinking, creative self-efficacy, learning self-efficacy (Fuller et al., 2018), risk-taking (Zhang et al., 2015), and other important values. Thus, personality traits play a mediating role, and the relationship between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship intention is definitely noteworthy.\nThe influence of policy support on entrepreneurial intention\nPolicy support significantly affects personality traits (\u03b2 = 0.310, P < 0.001). Although policy support does not directly influence entrepreneurial intention on a significant level; however, it does have a significant impact on entrepreneurial intention through personality traits. This verifies hypothesis 6 and reflects the mediating role of policy support. The results are also consistent with existing studies, which generally show that entrepreneurial policy and entrepreneurial intention are significantly related (Huang et al., 2021). College students generally understand national and local policies through indirect channels. Hence, the deeper the understanding of entrepreneurial policies, the stronger entrepreneurial intention is generated (Fu and He, 2020). Most especially, government support significantly influences entrepreneurial intention (Xiang and Sun, 2021). In the interview, this was found to be a relatively serious and major problem for college students\u2014 the lack of fund sources and insufficient understanding of policies led to the restrictions of entrepreneurial intention and activities. Some college students plan to be employed first and accumulated funds and experience before starting a business. The Mycos report (2020) also shows that the proportion of graduates starting their own businesses continues to rise with the extension of graduation.\nThe influence of social support on entrepreneurial intention\nSocial support significantly influences personality traits (\u03b2 = 0.258, P < 0.05). In addition, personality traits influence entrepreneurial intention significantly, thus confirming hypothesis 7. Mao and Ye (2021) revealed that social capital is directly tied to the individual. Huang et al. (2021) found that the accessibility of opportunities and financial support leads to real entrepreneurial behavior\u2014 the more favorable the entrepreneurial environment perceived by college students, the likelier they are to obtain environmental resources and to improve their entrepreneurial\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nwillingness. These results also coincide with previous those of previous studies."

Given the mediating effect of personality traits, it is essential to foster college students\u2019 personality traits of entrepreneurship. Personal factors have been confirmed as stronger triggering factors than contextual ones (Sesen and Ekemen, 2020). Although some personality variables are quite stable and difficult to change, McClelland (1961) posited that some entrepreneurial qualities can be taught. Nevertheless, Moraes et al. (2018) found that some competencies such as creativity, proactivity, and propensity to risk are not fully cultivated by necessary and appropriate teaching methods.\nEntrepreneurship education should reform to promote college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention. College students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention is affected by many factors (Ajzen, 1991). Systems and mechanisms in families, society, colleges, and enterprises should be established. According to the entrepreneurial ecosystem theory (Davies et al., 2005), the following factors are in a constant feedback loop: college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions are generated and put into practice by creating a favorable environment for innovation and entrepreneurship and providing the cultural\nenvironment, entrepreneurial funds, entrepreneurial resources, and entrepreneurial policies. All these need the guarantee of a sound system and mechanism to lay the foundation for future entrepreneurship.\n(1) Implications for college students\u2019 entrepreneurial practice: Currently, entrepreneurship is mainly promoted by the Chinese government using the top-down mode. In addition, the traditional teaching pays much attention to knowledge and professional skills, while the cultivation of students\u2019 entrepreneurship practice and ability remains lackluster. College students believe that entrepreneurship education and training are useful for entrepreneurship but have no obvious effect. College students\u2019 ability should be improved in the entrepreneurial practice. They need societal guidance; hence, universities and teachers ought to suit them to new situations and patterns. Professional education and entrepreneurship education need to be deeply integrated, and the curriculum system and teaching methods need to be reformed. This entails the creation of simulations, providing many projects, and making full use of virtual practice platforms. We should also reform the education goals, teaching methods, and learning resources coupled with other related yet necessary reforms (Shi et al., 2020). For example, case studies, group cooperative learning, visits to companies, company internships, simulations, interviews with entrepreneurs, and projects (Kuratko, 2005) are suggested in teaching. These techniques support the shift of college students from thoughts to deeds, from simulation to reality, and from private citizens to members of society. The skills, experience, and practice of business establishment and operation are also required, which include business plan writing, marketing, management, and product sales (Jamieson,\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\n1984). Different locales can adopt unique policies in response to the various local entrepreneurial circumstances.\n(2) Implications for improving college students\u2019 proactive personalities: The results of a structural equation model show that personality traits have a significant impact and play a mediating role in college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention: Students with low-risk tendency, low innovation, and lack of adventurous personal characteristics may have low entrepreneurial intention. This outlines the need to promote college students\u2019 risk awareness, innovation ability, and initiative. First and foremost, the spirit of exploration and adventure among college students needs to be fostered. The lack of risk awareness is a major factor in the low rate of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial activities are adventurous (Zhang et al., 2015); therefore, the cultivation of college students\u2019 self-confidence, communication ability, innovative spirit, entrepreneurship, and creative thinking should be based on the reform of the training system and resources (Ahmad et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2018). Hence, students are encouraged to express themselves and work together as a team under a less teacher-centered model. Inspiring entrepreneurial alertness in students\u2019 cognitive processes and fostering their entrepreneurial orientation are the goals of educational activities (Solesvik et al., 2013). Second, college students\u2019 initiative personality is cultivated in entrepreneurship training, such as professional programs and the like. College students can be encouraged to participating in some projects with low investment, low risk, and easy implementation. Then, the successful experience will enhance their self-confidence and allow them to accumulate entrepreneurial experience. Through these activities, college students can improve their problem-solving abilities and creativity in relation to building their own businesses. Although COVID-19 has affected entrepreneurship, the development of the Internet has also brought new opportunities for college students to build their own enterprises. College students should make use of the opportunities presented by campus agents, self-media, online businesses, and other types of online entrepreneurship. For instance, following COVID-19, online education, retail, e-commerce, and information technology have emerged as the primary entrepreneurial sectors."

            "text": "This study establishes a hierarchical model of the environmental factors affecting college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention from macro-, meso-, and micro-layers. The micro-system includes personality traits. The meso-system includes family support and education support and directly promotes entrepreneurial intention directly. The macro-system includes policy support and social support and indirectly influences entrepreneurial intention. Thus, various factors form a clear relationship. These results also provide a new perspective for further studies.\nSecond, the structural equation model of the environmental factors is established to clarify the impact and the relationship between internal and external factors. This supplements the existing influencing factors of entrepreneurial intention and provides a new theoretical perspective for further exploring the influencing process of internal and external environmental factors. It also explains the direct role of internal environmental factors and the indirect role of the external environment through the internal environment, which provides a certain theoretical value and the path from intention to behavior.\nThird, this study empirically examined the effects of policy support, social support, family support, education support, and personality traits on entrepreneurial intention through questionnaires and data analysis. Ultimately, it tried to explore two research questions: (1) What are the factors that influence college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention? (2) Do personality traits play the mediating effect of environmental factors on entrepreneurial intention? Based on the survey and results, personality traits have significant impacts on college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention, while family support, education support, policy support, and social support do not. Moreover, all the environmental factors (society support, family support, education support, and policy support) have significant impacts on personality traits. Hence, hypotheses H3, H4, H5, H6, andH7 are supported, while H1 and H2 are not confirmed. Personality traits play a mediating role in the environmental factors on entrepreneurial intention.\nOne limitation of this study is that the questionnaires were mainly implemented in Henan Province, thus restricting generalizability. Future studies could enlarge the survey scope in response. The reasons for some results need to be revealed in combination with interviews. There remains a large gap between entrepreneurial intention and behavior, which is also worthy of depth study. The investigation of the goal and ability is also made easier by failure entrepreneurship, a new area of study in entrepreneurship. In order to analyze the variations in experience between failure and success, we should further investigate the causes of entrepreneurial failure."
