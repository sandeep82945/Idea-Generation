"Feedback and further research are considered, and advanced data analysis techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, may be explored to enhance disease tracking and identification capabilities." 

"With the development of standardized protocols for sample collection and analysis and further advancements in IR spectroscopy, the potential for salivary diagnostics using IR spectroscopy is vast."

"Further investigations involving a larger number of patients, including those with complex diseases, are necessary to establish a comprehensive methodology that accounts for the diversity of saliva in the human population."

"In the future, we expect to see further advancements in IR spectroscopy, which will enhance its utility in salivary analysis."

"It is important to note that while IR spectroscopy holds promise in personalized medicine, further research, validation, and standardization are necessary to establish its clinical utility across different stages and subtypes of the disease."

"There is ongoing research on the use of new IR spectroscopy techniques such as surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy."
