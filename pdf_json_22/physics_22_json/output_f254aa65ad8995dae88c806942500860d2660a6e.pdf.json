    "abstractText": "Many radar applications require a high range resolution, entailing the necessity for a large signal bandwidth. When employing an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar system in its standard implementation, the radar system must operate at a high sampling frequency to ensure covering the entire signal bandwidth, thus imposing significant challenges on its implementation. Therefore, methods for reducing the sampling frequency are topic of recent research. In this work, a method for reducing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling frequency at the receiver without losing range resolution is proposed. This is achieved by activating only a fraction of the subcarriers at the transmitter, while simultaneously allowing for systematic aliasing due to undersampling in the receiver. This aliasing is designed such that the active subcarriers do not interfere with each other, which ensures a simple separation of them in the frequency domain. The proposed concept, denoted as subcarrier aliasing (SA), allows reducing the ADC sampling frequency in the receiver, but lacks in reducing the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) sampling frequency in the transmitter. However, the key asset of SA-OFDM lies in the properties of its waveform, making it especially suitable for joint radar and communication applications over other waveforms, e.g., stepped-carrier OFDM.",

INTRODUCTION\nJOINT radar and communication systems are an activefield of research with many potential applications, including automotive vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) [1]\u2013[10] is a promising waveform candidate for such systems, since it can be employed for the radar sensing and the communication task.\nManuscript received 2 October 2021; revised 19 February 2022 and 5 May 2022; accepted 5 June 2022. Date of publication 5 July 2022; date of current version 17 October 2022. This work was supported by Silicon Austria Labs (SAL), owned by the Republic of Austria, the Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG), the federal state of Carinthia, the Upper Austrian Research (UAR), and the Austrian Association for the Electric and Electronics Industry (FEEI). The review of this article was coordinated by Prof. Wan Choi. (Corresponding author: Oliver Lang.)\nOliver Lang and Mario Huemer are with the Institute of Signal Processing, Johannes Kepler University, 4040 Linz, Austria (e-mail: oliver.lang@jku.at; mario.huemer@jku.at).\nReinhard Feger is with the Institute for Communications Engineering and RF-Systems, Johannes Kepler University, 4040 Linz, Austria (e-mail: reinhard.feger@jku.at).\nChristian Hofbauer is with the Silicon Austria Labs GmbH, 4040 Linz, Austria (e-mail: christian.hofbauer@silicon-austria.com).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109/TVT.2022.3188511\nAn OFDM waveform features the following main system parameters [11]: the signal bandwidth B, the number of subcarriers Nc, the number of consecutively transmitted OFDM symbols Nsym, the carrier frequency fc, and the length of the cyclic prefix (CP) Tcp. These system parameters determine the performance measures of the radar system [11], namely: the maximum unambiguous range rmax, the range resolution \u0394r, the maximum unambiguous relative velocity vmax, and the velocity resolution \u0394v. In its standard implementation [3], these performance measures are given by [11]\n\u0394r = c0 2B\n\u0394v = c0\n2fcNsym(T0 + Tcp) (1)\nrmax = \u0394rNc vmax = \u00b1\u0394vNsym2 , (2) where c0 is the speed of light, T0 = 1/\u0394f = (Nc \u2212 1)/B is the duration of one OFDM symbol, and\u0394f represents the subcarrier spacing.\nFor many applications, the design of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for OFDM radar systems is a challenging task. One can identify at least three crucial requirements for the ADC design: 1) The ADC should have a high dynamic range to resolve strong nearby objects as well as weak distant objects. 2) The ADC should offer a high linearity to prevent an increase of the noise floor as well as ghost objects. 3) The ADC sampling frequency fs must be high enough to cover the entire signal bandwidth B. The latter one is discussed in more detail in the following.\nThe signal bandwidth B solely determines the range resolution \u0394r, cf. (1). For instance, a desired range resolution of \u0394r = 15 cm requires a bandwidth of B = 1 GHz. In a standard receiver, the ADC sampling frequency is low-bounded by fs \u2265 B, which entails the necessity of a very high-speed ADC for applications requiring a high range resolution.\nThe design and implementation of a very high-speed ADC is undoubtedly a challenging task and thus requires approaches to handle this. Several methods for reducing the ADC sampling frequency without sacrificing range resolution are proposed in the literature. One possible approach is to sample the entire bandwidth B sequentially rather than at once. This can be done by transmitting OFDM blocks with a lower bandwidth at different carrier frequencies either step-wise [12]\u2013[21], denoted as stepped-carrier OFDM, or even continuously [22]. The\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

For instance, the maximum unambiguous velocity vmax is reduced due to the transmission of the sequential transmission of the blocks and due to an additional phase-locked loop (PLL) settling time between the blocks [13]. Another disadvantage arises for the communication task, where the repeatedly changing carrier frequency complicates synchronizing transmitter and communication receiver. Another approach to reduce the ADC sampling frequency is denoted as frequency comb OFDM radar [23], [24] and utilizes a comb of carrier frequencies simultaneously for upand down-conversion of a baseband signal with a lower bandwidth. Unfortunately, generating a comb of carrier frequencies implies a significantly increased hardware complexity.\nIn this work, a novel OFDM joint radar and communication system is proposed which allows reducing the ADC sampling frequency without sacrificing range resolution. This not only eases the design and implementation of the ADC, but also the design and implementation of the receiver signal processing blocks, since they can be run at a reduced processing speed. These advantages are achieved at the cost of a reduced processing gain compared to a standard OFDM system due to the reduced number of available ADC samples. The method proposed in this work is denoted as subcarrier aliasing (SA), and the resulting waveform is denoted as SA-OFDM. The proposed joint radar and communication system based on the SA method is simply referred to as SA-OFDM radar system for discussions concerning the radar sensing task, and as SA-OFDM communication system for discussions regarding the communication task.\nFor SA, only a fraction of the subcarriers are active at the transmitter. All other subcarriers are zero subcarriers with no transmit energy. On the receiver side, the ADC uses a reduced sampling frequency fs < B and thus introduces aliasing of the receive signal. However, aliasing is introduced in a systematic and controlled matter, such that the affected active subcarriers appear at the positions of originally zero subcarriers and thus do not interfere each other. Hence, the active subcarriers can be easily separated in frequency domain.\nPlease note that stepped-carrier OFDM allows reducing the sampling frequency of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in the transmitter and the ADC in the receiver. This is a clear advantage of stepped-carrier OFDM over SA-OFDM, which only allows reducing the ADC sampling frequency. However, a clear disadvantage of stepped-carrier OFDM is the resulting difficulties for the communication task in a joint radar sensing and communication application. As will be discussed in this work, repeatedly changing the carrier frequency complicates synchronization between the transmitter and the communication receiver. Possible approaches to allow for a constant carrier frequency at the communication receiver either require an ADC covering the whole signal bandwidth, or reduce the data rate (cf. Section V). In contrast to that, SA-OFDM is ideally suited for the communication task. In fact, it will turn out that the communication signal model for SA-OFDM can be formulated to match that for OFDM. This allows employing well-known\nmethods for synchronization, channel estimation, and data estimation designed for OFDM communication systems also for SA-OFDM communication systems.\nThe analysis carried out in this work is briefly described in the following. The signal model and the receiver signal processing scheme\nfor an SA-OFDM radar system is derived. The performance of the SA-OFDM radar system is investigated by evaluating the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the processing gain, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the range-Doppler map (RDM). Measurement results for an SA-OFDM radar system are presented and analyzed. Transmitter and receiver signal processing schemes for an SA-OFDM communication system are proposed. The SA-OFDM transmitter and receiver signal processing schemes are incorporated in a complete communication system including methods for channel estimation, synchronization, and data estimation. Finally, the bit error ratio (BER) performance of an SAOFDM communication system is compared with that of a standard OFDM communication system via simulations. This paper is organized as follows. Section II recaps the OFDM radar signal model, which is then used for the derivation of the proposed SA-OFDM radar system in Section III. This radar system is discussed and analyzed in Section IV. A comparison to stepped-carrier OFDM and frequency comb OFDM is carried out in Section V. Section VI presents the measurement results for an SA-OFDM radar system. The SA-OFDM communication system is proposed and discussed in Section VII. The BER simulations are presented in Section VIII, and finally, Section IX concludes this work.\nNotation: Lower-case bold face variables (a, b,...) indicate vectors, and upper-case bold face variables (A, B,...) indicate matrices.

            "text": "SA-OFDM is derived based on the OFDM signal model introduced in [4], which will be briefly repeated in this section. We refer to [4] for the complete derivation and all details. Overall, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic principles behind the OFDM waveform [4], [25].\nThe OFDM waveform consists of Nc subcarriers in the frequency domain. TheseNc subcarriers are equidistantly allocated within a bandwidthB, resulting in a subcarrier spacing of\u0394f = B/Nc. The complex-valued amplitude values of the subcarriers are referred to as subcarrier symbols. These subcarrier symbols are usually drawn from a symbol alphabet, e.g., the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) symbol alphabet. Let S \u2208 CNc\u00d7Nsym contain the subcarrier symbols for all Nc subcarriers and for all Nsym consecutively transmitted OFDM symbols. Each row of S represents a subcarrier, and each column of S represents an OFDM symbol. The corresponding time domain OFDM symbols are obtained by applying an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) of lengthNc on the columns ofS. The duration of these time domain OFDM symbols is T = 1/\u0394f = Nc/fs. Adding the CP of length Tcp extends the signal duration to TOFDM = T + Tcp.\nThe radio frequency (RF) transmit signal is obtained by modulating the OFDM time domain signal onto a carrier frequency fc. The corresponding receive signal consists in general of multiple delayed and damped copies of the transmit signal originating from different propagation paths between a transmit and receive antenna. The number of propagation paths is denoted as Npath. The propagation distance for the ith path is denoted as ri with 0 \u2264 i < Npath. The corresponding round-trip delay time is given by \u03c4i = 2ri/c0. The so-called normalized time delay is defined as \u03c4\u0304i = \u03c4i\u0394f . A potential relative velocity along the ith path is denoted as vi. This relative velocity causes a Doppler shift of fDi = \u22122vifc/c0, which is normalized to f\u0304Di = fDi/\u0394f .\nThe matrix Ytf,ts \u2208 CNc\u00d7Nsym contains the received time domain OFDM symbols after demodulation with the carrier frequency fc and removal of the CP. This matrix is given by [4]\nYtf,ts = Npath\u22121\u2211 i=0 a\u0304iDNc ( f\u0304Di Nc ) F\u22121NcD \u2217 Nc (\u03c4\u0304i)SDNsym(f\u0304Di\u03b1),\n(6)\nwhere tf and ts stand for fast time and slow time, respectively, and where the noise term is neglected. The expression in (6) is discussed in the following. The frequency domain OFDM\nsymbols in S are transformed into time domain via multiplication with F\u22121Nc from the left. The delay due to propagation is modelled in frequency domain via D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i). The quantity \u03b1 \u2208 R is defined as \u03b1 = (T + Tcp)/T . a\u0304i in (6) is defined as a\u0304i = ai \u00b7 exp(\u2212j2\u03c0fc\u03c4i), where ai \u2208 C models an assumed constant amplitude and phase change for the ith path. The distortions caused by the Doppler shift are modelled in form of a common phase error (CPE) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) [4]. The CPE is represented by DNsym(f\u0304Di\u03b1), and the ICI\neffect modelled byDNc ( f\u0304Di Nc ) . To simplify matters, the ICI term is neglected for the mathematical derivations for convenience, but it will be included for all simulations.\nOn basis of the model in (6), the proposed SA-OFDM joint radar and communication system is derived in the sequel. Section III\u2013VI investigate SA-OFDM in the context of radar sensing, while Section VII and Section VIII focus on aspects in the context of communications."

            "text": "Fig. 1 sketches the basic principle of SA-OFDM. There, the left bar represents a transmit OFDM symbol in frequency domain. Within this OFDM symbol, only every \u03bcth subcarrier with \u03bc \u2208 N+ is chosen to be an active subcarrier (gray blocks). Between these active subcarriers, there are \u03bc\u2212 1 zero subcarriers with no transmit energy (white boxes). On the receiver side, the ADC uses a reduced sampling frequency fs < B and thus introduces aliasing of the receive signal. This aliasing causes the affected active subcarriers to appear at the positions of originally zero subcarriers, such that they do not interfere each other. Hence, the active subcarriers can be easily separated in frequency domain (middle bar in Fig. 1). Aliasing changes the order of the active subcarriers observed at the receiver in comparison to the transmit signal. However, this can easily be compensated by a re-ordering step in the receiver (right bar in Fig. 1).\nFig. 2 shows the basic radar signal processing scheme for an SA-OFDM radar system, which will be discussed in the following.\nTransmit signal: Recall thatS contains the subcarrier symbols for all Nc subcarriers and for all Nsym OFDM symbols. In SAOFDM, only every \u03bcth subcarrier is a so-called active subcarrier with \u03bc \u2208 N+. The number of active subcarriers is denoted as Na and can be derived according to Na = \u2308 Nc \u03bc \u2309 . All other subcarriers are zero subcarriers with no transmit energy. Loading\nof the active subcarriers and inserting the zero subcarriers in S is mathematically described by\nS = \u03bcBzS\u0304, (7)\nwhere S\u0304 \u2208 CNa\u00d7Nsym contains the subcarrier symbols for the active subcarriers, and where Bz \u2208 CNc\u00d7Na inserts \u03bc\u2212 1 zero subcarriers between the active subcarriers. In this work, it is assumed that Bz is designed such that the first subcarrier represented by the top row of S is an active subcarrier. Formally, only activating every \u03bcth subcarrier reduces the average power of the time domain transmit signal by a factor of \u03bc according to Parseval\u2019s theorem. Thus, \u03bc is introduced in (7) to prevent this reduction of the average transmit power.\nReceive signal: The receiver uses a reduced ADC sampling frequency such that fs < B. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume fs = B\u03ba with \u03ba \u2208 N+. Then, the sampling process can be modelled by taking only every \u03bath sample from (6). This can be described by employing a selection matrix Bs \u2208 CNs\u00d7Nc , which selects every \u03bath sample beginning with the first one. The number of ADC samples obtained this way is given by Ns = \u2308 Nc \u03ba \u2309 . Now, the receive signal for SA-OFDM follows from inserting (7) into (6),1 and employing the selection matrix Bs, yielding\nUtf,ts = Npath\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bca\u0304iBsF \u22121 Nc D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i)BzS\u0304DNsym(f\u0304Di\u03b1), (8)\nDFT along columns: The receive signal in frequency domain is obtained by applying a DFT of length Ns on the columns of Utf,ts in (8), yielding\nUf,ts = FNsUtf,ts (9)\n= Npath\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bca\u0304iFNsBsF \u22121 Nc D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i)BzS\u0304DNsym(f\u0304Di\u03b1).\n(10)\nThe goal of this processing step is to recover the received active subcarriers. This requires that each of the Ns frequency bins is occupied by at most one active subcarrier, which is ensured, if two constraints are fulfilled.\nThe first constraint is thatNc must be an integer multiple of \u03ba. Otherwise, the active subcarriers would be placed \u201cin between\u201d the frequency bins, causing severe windowing effects due to loss of orthogonality. This effect is clarified in Fig. 3, which shows the time domain signal for the real part of an arbitrary\n1and neglecting the ICI term as already discussed.\nreceived subcarrier. The Ns = Nc = 16 ADC samples obtained for \u03ba = 1 are marked with blue crosses. Comparing the signal at the left and the right border shows that it can be interpreted as a circular periodic signal, and thus, the corresponding frequency domain representation is a single Dirac peak located on a DFT bin without any windowing effects. Now, reducing the ADC sampling frequency, e.g., by a factor\u03ba = 2 (red crosses) delivers again a circular periodic signal such that its frequency transform is a single Dirac peak at a DFT bin. However, reducing the ADC sampling frequency by a factor of \u03ba = 3, and thus Nc/\u03ba = N+, yields the signal indicated with black squares. This signal is not circular periodic anymore, and so, severe windowing effects are observed in frequency domain. This is why we choose Nc to be an integer multiple of \u03ba. With this choice, the number of ADC samples Ns modifies to Ns = \u2308 Nc \u03ba \u2309 = Nc\u03ba .\nThe second constraint ensures suitable combinations of \u03bc, \u03ba, and Nc for SA-OFDM. Non-appropriate combinations may result in two or more active subcarriers occupying the same frequency bin in (10) due to aliasing. Whether this is the case or not can be clarified in the following way. Removing all terms modelling the propagation paths from (10), and replacing S\u0304 by 1Na such that a one is transmitted on all Na active subcarriers, yields\nt1 = Nc Ns FNsBsF \u22121 Nc Bz1 Na \u2208 CNs , (11)\nwhere the factor Nc/Ns accounts for a scaling introduced by FNs and F \u22121 Nc\n. If t1 consists of Na ones and Ns \u2212Na zeros, then every frequency bin is occupied by at most one active subcarrier. Zeros in t1 indicate frequency bins not occupied by any active subcarrier. A value larger than 1 as well as a complex value in t1 would indicate that two or more active subcarriers are occupying the same frequency bin. Alg. 1 shows a systematic approach for finding a suitable \u03bc for given values of \u03ba and Nc based on evaluating (11). \u03bcmax serves as a stopping criterion in case no suitable combination of \u03bc, \u03ba, and Nc can be found.\nSorting: Naturally, with aliasing comes a distorted order of the active subcarriers compared to the transmit signal. In this processing step, the active subcarriers are re-sorted to obtain the correct order.\nA pragmatic approach for identifying the observed order of active subcarriers is based on (11), except that 1Na is replaced\nby [ 1 2 . . . Na ]T \u2208 CNa , with the result that a one is transmitted at the first active subcarrier, a two is transmitted on the second active subcarrier, and so on. Doing so yields\nt2 = Nc Ns FNsBsF \u22121 Nc Bz\n[ 1 2 . . . Na ]T \u2208 CNs . (12)\nThe observed order of active subcarriers can then be seen in t2 and can further be used to construct a sorting matrix Bso \u2208 CNa\u00d7Ns that reconstructs the correct order of the received active subcarriers. Applying this sorting matrix on (10) yields\nVf,ts = BsoUf,ts (13)\n= Npath\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bca\u0304iBsoFNsBsF \u22121 Nc D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i)BzS\u0304DNsym(f\u0304Di\u03b1),\n(14)\nwhich allows for some simplifications. First, the product D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i)Bz is inspected.Bz adds\u03bc\u2212 1 zero subcarriers between the active subcarriers, and D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i) applies a phase rotation on all subcarriers. The order of D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i) and Bz can be exchanged when accounting for the zero subcarriers in D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i). Thus, it holds that D\u2217Nc(\u03c4\u0304i)Bz = BzD \u2217 Na (\u03bc\u03c4\u0304i), yielding\nVf,ts = Npath\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bca\u0304iBsoFNsBsF \u22121 Nc BzD \u2217 Na (\u03bc\u03c4\u0304i)S\u0304DNsym(f\u0304Di\u03b1).\n(15)\nSecond, the term BsoFNsBsF \u22121 Nc Bz turns out to be an identity matrix scaled by a factor Ns/Nc. Thus, (15) can be simplified to\nVf,ts = Npath\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bca\u0304i Ns Nc D\u2217Na(\u03bc\u03c4\u0304i)S\u0304DNsym(f\u0304Di\u03b1). (16)\nElement-wise division: DividingVf,ts in (16) element-wise by S\u0304 leads to\nZf,ts = Vf,ts S\u0304 (17)\n= Npath\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bca\u0304i Ns Nc D\u2217Na(\u03bc\u03c4\u0304i)1 Na(1Nsym)TDNsym(f\u0304Di\u03b1),\n(18)\nwhere the identity (DaMDb) M = Da1n(1m)TDb was utilized, which holds for arbitrary matrices M \u2208 Cn\u00d7m with nonzero elements, arbitrary diagonal matrices Da \u2208 Cn\u00d7n and Db \u2208 Cm\u00d7m.

            "text": "It is well-known that a relative velocity of an object destroys the orthogonality of the subcarriers at the receiver, which leads to ICI. This ICI degrades the SNR in the RDM [4]. This degradation is analyzed via simulations in the following. For that, we assume a carrier frequency fc = 76.6 GHz, a bandwidth B = 1 GHz, Nc = 1024 subcarriers, and Nsym = 256 OFDM symbols. The length of the CP is Tcp = 1\u03bcs for all considered waveforms, although it could have been reduced for SA-OFDM due to its reduced maximum unambiguous range rmax. The radar scenario contains a single object (Npath = 1) at a distance of 10 m and with a0 = 10. Additive measurement noise is dismissed such that ICI is the only source of noise. This ICI is caused by a relative velocity of the object, which is proportional to the normalized Doppler shift f\u0304Di = fDi/\u0394f . The effect of ICI on the SNR is analyzed for a standard OFDM radar system, a stepped-carrier OFDM radar system with Nsb = 2 sub-\nbands, a stepped-carrier OFDM radar system with Nsb = 4 subbands, an SA-OFDM radar system with \u03ba = 2 (Na = 342), and an SA-OFDM radar system with \u03ba = 4 (Na = 205).\nThe values for Nsb are chosen such that the ADC sampling frequencies coincide with those of the SA-OFDM radar systems.\nThe SNR values are obtained by subtracting the noise floor from the dB value of the highest peak in the RDM. The noise floor is estimated as the median magnitude value of the RDM in dB. The SNR values obtained this way are shown in Fig. 5 in dependency of the normalized Doppler shift f\u0304Di . These curves show that the degradation of the SNR due to ICI is quite similar for all considered radar systems. The stepped-carrier OFDM radar systems have a loss in SNR of approximately 3 dB (Nsb = 2), and approximately 6 dB (Nsb = 4) compared to the standard OFDM radar system due to the reduced processing gains. Although the SA-OFDM radar systems have lower processing gains than the stepped-carrier OFDM radar systems, the SNR curves almost lie on top of each other. This is due to the fact that SA-OFDM (with this parametrization) contains zero subcarriers in the receive signal even after aliasing, which reduces the impact of ICI."

In contrast to that, SA-OFDM only allows reducing the ADC sampling frequency in the receiver, while the DAC sampling frequency in the transmitter remains unaltered.\nIn general, the standard OFDM waveform is suited for joint radar sensing and communication applications, consequently also stepped-carrier OFDM can be deployed. However, the need for changing the carrier frequency in this approach raises some technical challenges, as the communication receiver is urged to follow this carrier frequency with its own PLL, which severely complicates synchronization and thus the design of the communication receiver.\nA circumvention for this problem could be a limitation of the communication link to a single subband in the frequency\ndomain. Then, the communication receiver could use a single constant carrier frequency for demodulation, but on the other hand would lead to long pauses within the receive signal, entailing a significant reduction of the achievable data rate. Due to the reduction to a single subband and the long pauses within the receive signal, the data rate would be reduced by a factor of 1/N 2sb compared to a standard OFDM system utilizing the full bandwidth, where Nsb denotes the number of subbands used by a stepped-carrier OFDM system. Compared to an SA-OFDM system providing the same reduction of the ADC sampling frequency, the data rate of the stepped-carrier OFDM system would be reduced approximately by a factor of 1/Nsb. The loss in data rate becomes even more when considering the settling-time of the PLL. In contrast to that, SA-OFDM is ideally suited for enabling communications in joint radar sensing and communication applications as will be shown in Section VII.\nThe next comparison focuses on the SNR in the RDM for the radar sensing task, whose outcome is not unambiguous and depends on the underlying terms. On the one hand, in case\u03bc > \u03ba, the receive signal for SA-OFDM contains zero subcarriers even after aliasing, which decreases the SNR of an SA-OFDM radar system in relation to a stepped-carrier OFDM radar system. On the other hand, stepped-carrier OFDM additionally suffers from a PLL induced SNR loss, with the actual loss depending on the specific PLL and thus being hard to quantify. One reason is that stepped-carrier OFDM introduces unused time slots due to the settling-time of the PLL, which translates to an SNR loss compared to SA-OFDM when keeping the total measurement time constant for both methods, which seems to be a reasonable assumption for a fair comparison. A second reason is that in general designing a PLL with fast settling time negatively affects the achievable phase noise characteristics, which translates to an additional SNR reduction in the RDM [13]. Due to these reasons, a general statement about the SNR of SA-OFDM in comparison to the SNR of stepped-carrier OFDM is rather difficult to make and requires more assumptions on the hardware.\nStepped-carrier OFDM reduces the ADC sampling frequency at the cost of a reduced vmax, while SA-OFDM reduces the ADC sampling frequency at the cost of a reduced rmax. Which one of these circumstances infers more severe limitations depends on the application and on the parametrization of the OFDM waveform [10], [11].\nBoth systems also differ in terms of mutual interferences. Mutual interferences of different radar devices are considered as a major issue [27], [28]. For SA-OFDM systems, interferences within the complete bandwidth including all active subcarriers and all zero subcarriers have an influence on the radar system\u2019s performance. For stepped-carrier OFDM systems, only the part of the interference that falls within the currently covered subband influences the radar system\u2019s performance."

Both systems introduce zero subcarriers between the active subcarriers, and both systems allow for a reduction of the ADC sampling frequency at the cost of a decreased maximum\nunambiguous range rmax. Besides that, there exist the following similarities and differences worth being discussed. Frequency comb OFDM radar system requires a comb of\ncarrier frequencies for up- and down-conversion. On the one hand, this allows not only for a reduction of the ADC sampling frequency in the receiver, but also for a reduction of the DAC sampling frequency in the transmitter. On the other hand, generating a comb of carrier frequencies comes along with a significantly increased hardware complexity. As stated in [23], frequency comb OFDM is very sensitive to imperfectly calibrated amplitude and phase values of the spectral components of the frequency comb. An imperfect calibration leads to a reduced dynamic range and an increased peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR). In contrast to that, SA-OFDM utilizes only a single carrier frequency, such that no amplitude or phase calibration is required. Concerning the impact of mutual interferences of different radar devices, SA-OFDM systems and frequency comb OFDM systems are expected to be affected in a similar way."

There, the transmit data in S\u0304 are mapped onto the active subcarriers with \u03bc\u2212 1 zero subcarriers between them. After a transformation into time domain and an extension by the CP, the time domain signal is convolved with the complex BB channel impulse response (CIR). This CIR models the transmission from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna in BB. The receiver senses the signal with a reduced ADC sampling frequency, removes the CP, and performs a DFT to obtain the received active subcarriers. These active subcarriers are then sorted to restore the correct order. The shown processing blocks correspond to those already discussed for the radar receiver in Section III.\nFig. 7 indicates two different ways of representing the communication link as discussed in the following.\n1) CIR Representation: The first way of modelling the transmission is to use the CIR between the transmit and the receive antenna. The CIR is denoted as f \u2208 CNf of an assumed length Nf \u2264 Nc.\nAlternatively, a frequency domain representation of the CIR denoted as channel frequency response (CFR) p \u2208 CNc can be derived via\np = FNcBzpf , (27)\nwhere Bzp \u2208 CNc\u00d7Nf is a matrix that zero-pads the CIR f to a length of Nc.\n2) ECFR Representation: Note that the processing chain shown in Fig. 7 begins with the transmit subcarrier symbols for the active subcarriers and ends with the received subcarrier symbols at the active subcarriers in correct order. Hence, from a point of data estimation, it makes sense to combine all transformations and manipulations shown in Fig. 7 into one channel denoted as effective channel frequency response (ECFR). The derivation of the ECFR is described based on Fig. 8 for a simplified scenario. There, the first graph sketches an exemplary CIR f of length Nf = 4. The corresponding CFR p has a length of Nc = 16, incorporates the channel coefficients for all subcarriers and is shown in the second graph of Fig. 8. The channel coefficients at the active subcarriers for an exemplary value of \u03bc = 2 are indicated in red color. The channel coefficients of the active subcarriers only (and in correct order) form an ECFR h \u2208 CNa\ndepicted in the third graph. In this example, the ECFR has a length of Na = 8. The time domain representation of the ECFR denoted as effective channel impulse response (ECIR) g \u2208 CNa is given as\ng = F\u22121Nah. (28)\nInterestingly, if it holds that Nc/\u03bc = Na, and if Nf \u2264 Na, the ECIR g is equivalent to the CIR h zero-padded to a length of Na, which is proven in Appendix A. Hence, the ECIR g contains Na \u2212Nf zeros at the tail. This fact reduces the dimensionality of the channel estimation problem from Na to Nf , which can be beneficially exploited to increase the accuracy of the channel estimation [31]\u2013[34]."

The channel encoder utilizes a convolutional channel code with coding rate r = 1/2, constraint length 7 and the generator polynomials (133, 171)8 in octal representation [33], [37]. The encoded bits are fed into a random interleaver whose block length is equal to the number of coded bits within an OFDM symbol. The interleaved bits are mapped onto QPSK symbols.\nThe channels are estimated using a standard method based on preamble OFDM symbols known to the receiver [32]\u2013[34]. This method estimates the channel in time domain to reduce the dimensionality of the estimation problem (cf. Section VII-A).\nSynchronization aspects considered in this work are limited to Doppler shift induced effects and are implemented in the form of CPE estimation and compensation utilizing pilot subcarriers known to the receiver [33], [38]\u2013[40]. Data estimation is performed using a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator [31], [33], [41]. Since these methods are all well-known standard techniques, a detailed description is omitted in this work. The LMMSE output is transformed into soft information in form of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) [42]\u2013[44]. These LLRs are further fed into the deinterleaver and a Viterbi decoder [45].\nThe employed model for randomized CIR generation is described in [46]\u2013[48]. A detailed description of this model is omitted in this work. The BER performances are evaluated by averaging over 5 000 line of sight (LOS) and 5 000 non-line of sight (NLOS) channels. These channels are quasi-static for the case of zero relative velocity, meaning that they stay constant during the transmission of one burst of Nsym OFDM symbols. For the considered case of non-zero relative velocity, which is drawn from a uniform distribution between \u00b160 m/s, the channels are not quasi-static anymore, but superimposed by Doppler shift effects modelled in the form of ICI and CPE [33].\nThe considered standard OFDM communication system has a sampling frequency of fs = B, while the SA-OFDM communication system uses fs = B/\u03ba at the receiver. Assuming the same symbol alphabet and the same coding rate, this implies different data rates for the two systems. To achieve a fair comparison, the BER performances are compared for the same Eb/N0 value measured before the ADC. Eb represents the average energy per bit of information, and N0/2 indicates the double-sided noise power spectral density of a bandpass noise signal [33]. The time domain noise variance \u03c32n follows as [49]\n\u03c32n = Ps\n(Eb/N0) r b \u03b6 \u03bd , (29)\nwhere Ps represents the average power in time domain at the input of the ADC and b the number of coded bits per data symbol. Since only QPSK data symbols are considered, b is set to 2. The parameter \u03b6 is defined as \u03b6 = Nc/(Ncp +Nc) and accounts for the samples in the CP. \u03bd accounts for the reduction in data rate due to potentially activating only a subset of subcarriers for data transmission. It is thus \u03bd = 1 for a standard OFDM system and \u03bd = Na/Nc for SA-OFDM. For a given Eb/N0 value, the noise\nvariance in SA-OFDM will thus be higher than in a standard OFDM system.\n1) Perfect Channel Knowledge; Perfect CPE Synchronization: The first simulation scenario considers perfect channel knowledge and perfect CPE synchronization. Fig. 9 visualizes the resulting BER performances for coded and uncoded transmission. As expected, standard OFDM outperforms SA-OFDM. The loss in BER performance is approx. 3 dB for \u03ba = 2, and by approx. 6 dB for \u03ba = 4 measured for the coded case and at a BER of 10\u22124.\nIn the remainder of this work, simulation results for the uncoded case are not shown anymore due to its limited practical relevance.\n2) Perfect CPE Synchronization; Imperfect Channel Knowledge: For the second simulation, the channel is not perfectly known but estimated based on preamble OFDM symbols. The number of preamble OFDM symbols is set to 4 for both systems. The resulting BER performances are shown in Fig. 10, which also contains the BER performances for perfect channel knowledge from Fig. 9 as reference. As can be seen, the SA-OFDM communication system is slightly more affected by imperfect channel knowledge. However, the loss in BER performance can be considered to be low for both systems.\n3) Perfect Channel Knowledge; Imperfect CPE Synchronization: For the third simulation, CPE synchronization is performed using pilot subcarriers, while the channel is perfectly known to the receiver. The resulting BER performances when employing 16 pilot subcarriers are shown in Fig. 11 together\nwith the BER performances for the case of perfect CPE synchronization from Fig. 9. It turns out that the loss in BER due to imperfect CPE synchronization is minimal for both systems."

            "heading": "IX. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this work, a novel joint radar and communication system denoted as SA-OFDM was proposed. The main advantage of SA-OFDM over a standard OFDM joint radar and communication system is that it allows for reducing the ADC sampling frequency in the receiver without sacrificing range resolution. This advantage leads to a simplified design and implementation of the ADC and follow-up processing blocks. Disadvantages of SA-OFDM over a standard OFDM joint radar and communication system include a reduced maximum unambiguous range and a lower SNR in the RDM. Compared to stepped-carrier OFDM, a clear drawback of SA-OFDM is that it does not allow for a reduction of the DAC sampling frequency in the transmitter as it does for the ADC in the receiver. However, a clear advantage of SA-OFDM over stepped-carrier OFDM is that it simplifies simultaneous communication and radar sensing.\nThe theoretical analysis of SA-OFDM for the radar sensing task was supplemented and completed by radar measurements. For the communication task, it was shown that essential processing blocks of the transmitter and the receiver can be represented by a so-called effective channel. This effective channel representation allowed employing well-known methods for channel estimation, synchronization and data estimation from standard OFDM communications systems also for SA-OFDM systems. The performances of these methods were analyzed by means of BER simulations."

            "text": "This appendix analyzes the relation between the CIR f \u2208 CNf and the ECIR g \u2208 CNa introduced in Section VII-A.\nRecall that f \u2208 CNf is a time domain vector representing the CIR between the transmit antenna and the receive antenna. The CFR p \u2208 CNc is a frequency domain vector containing the frequency response for all Nc subcarriers. h \u2208 CNa is the ECFR\nand contains the frequency response of theNa active subcarriers. The ECIR g \u2208 CNa is the time domain version of the ECFR.\nThe ECIR g \u2208 CNa can be derived in vector representation from the ECFR h \u2208 CNa according to (28). Hence, the nth element of g is given by\n[g]n = 1 Na Na\u22121\u2211 k=0 [h]k exp ( j2\u03c0 kn Na ) for 0 \u2264 n < Na.\n(30)\nThe kth element of h, denoted as [h]k, on the other hand can be obtained from the CFR p \u2208 CNc according to\n[h]k = [p]\u03bck for 0 \u2264 k < Na. (31) By reformulating (27), the scalars [p]\u03bck can be identified to be\n[p]\u03bck = Nf\u22121\u2211 m=0 [f ]m exp ( \u2212j2\u03c0\u03bckm Nc ) for 0 \u2264 k < Na.\n(32)\nCombining (30)\u2013(32) allows for\n[g]n = 1 Na Na\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( Nf\u22121\u2211 m=0 [f ]m exp ( \u2212j2\u03c0\u03bckm Nc ))\n\u00b7 exp ( j2\u03c0 kn\nNa\n) (33)\n= 1 Na Na\u22121\u2211 k=0 Nf\u22121\u2211 m=0 [f ]m exp ( j2\u03c0k ( n Na \u2212 \u03bcm Nc )) (34)\n= 1 Na Nf\u22121\u2211 m=0 [f ]m ( Na\u22121\u2211 k=0 exp ( j2\u03c0k ( n Na \u2212 \u03bcm Nc ))) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ns(n,m)\n(35)\n= 1 Na Nf\u22121\u2211 m=0 [f ]m s(n,m). (36)\nThe scalar s(n,m) \u2208 C depends on \u03bc, Nc, and Na, and is analyzed for two cases.\nThe first case is when Nc/\u03bc = Na, for which s(n,m) is a scaled Dirac delta function s(n,m) = Na \u03b4[(n\u2212m)%Na]. Thus, it follows that the observed ECIR corresponds to\n[g]n = Nf\u22121\u2211 m=0 [f ]m \u03b4 [(n\u2212m)%Na] (37)\nwith 0 \u2264 n < Na. A further simplification is observed when Nf \u2264 Na, for which it holds that\n[g]n = [f ]n for 0 \u2264 n < Nf , (38) and [g]n = 0 forNf \u2264 n < Na. Thus, in this scenario, the ECIR is equivalent to the CIR zero-padded to a length of Na.\nThe second case is when Nc/\u03bc = Na, for which s(n,m) is not a scaled Dirac delta function anymore. Then, the ECFR g corresponds to the CIR f distorted by windowing effects, and can be derived via (35).\nREFERENCES\n[1] N.
