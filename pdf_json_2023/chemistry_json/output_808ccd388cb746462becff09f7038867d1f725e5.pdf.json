    "abstractText": "The enhancement of the endocannabinoid tone might have a beneficial influence on hypertension. Polypharmacology proposes multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of complex diseases. In the present paper, we studied JZL195, a dual inhibitor of the two major endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Hemodynamic parameters were assessed in conscious animals via radiotelemetry and tail-cuff methods and then evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). Single administration of JZL195 induced dose-dependent weak hypotensive and bradycardic responses in SHR but not in WKY. Similarly, its chronic application revealed only a slight hypotensive potential which, however, effectively prevented the progression of hypertension and did not undergo tolerance. In addition, multiple JZL195 administrations slightly decreased heart rate only in WKY and prevented the gradual weight gain in both groups. JZL195 did not affect organ weights, blood glucose level, rectal temperature and plasma oxidative stress markers. In conclusion, chronic dual FAAH/MAGL inhibition prevents the progression of hypertension in SHR without affecting some basal functions of the body. In addition, our study clearly proves the suitability of AUC for the evaluation of weak blood pressure changes.",

            "text": "Arterial hypertension is one of the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, which still remain the leading cause of death worldwide (e.g., [1\u20133]). Approximately 90% of hypertensive patients suffer from primary hypertension, i.e., not related to renal or endocrine disorders. Unfortunately, despite the plenitude of marketed antihypertensive drugs, which act at different molecular targets, resistance to antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is considered a significant problem. Depending on the local circumstances, about 10 to 20% of hypertensive patients are found resistant which increases cardiovascular risk [1]. Therefore, searching for new compounds, with the ability to effectively lower blood pressure (BP), seems justified. Cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids and endocannabinoids) are being extensively investigated as possible antihypertensive compounds, but their impact on cardiovascular parameters under study is often model-dependent. In our study, we used the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10942. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241310942 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10942 2 of 18\nwell-established rodent model of primary hypertension, i.e., spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), with Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) as their normotensive controls. We focused on the two best-studied endocannabinoids exhibiting strong vasodilatory effects in isolated human and animal arteries, i.e., anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), as well as the enzymes involved in their degradation, i.e., fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), respectively (for review, see [4,5]). Antihypertensive properties of AEA in primary hypertension have been explored in several studies to date. The AEA-induced vasorelaxation in SHR was enhanced in the thoracic aorta [6], but diminished in the mesenteric arterial bed [6] and in small resistance mesenteric arteries [7]. Acute intravenous (i.v.) injection of AEA or its stable analog methanandamide (MethAEA) into anesthetized and conscious SHR decreased BP and heart rate (HR) with no or moderate effects in the respective normotensive control animals [8\u201311]. Similarly, chronic administration of nanoformulated AEA for 4 weeks in SHR revealed a hypotensive effect [11]. FAAH inhibitors indirectly increase the level of AEA by blocking its enzymatic degradation. The FAAH inhibitor URB597 enhanced the vasodilatory effect of AEA [12] more markedly in SHR than in WKY. Moreover, the i.v. infusion of URB597 and/or another FAAH inhibitor, AM3506, or of the endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitors, AM404 and OMDM-2, into anesthetized or conscious SHR reduced BP and HR (as opposed to WKY) [8\u201310] but failed to modify these parameters in other studies with conscious SHR [13\u201315]. URB597 given intraperitoneally (i.p.; 1 mg/kg; twice a day) for 2 weeks failed to modify BP and HR in SHR [16]. Despite the lack of an antihypertensive effect of chronic i.p. URB597 treatment, it had a mostly positive impact on blood vessels, cardiac performance and metabolism, redox balance or inflammatory processes in different tissues (reviewed in detail in [5]). In contrast to AEA, the knowledge about the impact of 2-AG on cardiovascular parameters is quite limited and this has much to do with its short half-life [17]. Given i.v., 2-AG decreased BP and increased HR in anesthetized mice probably via its arachidonate metabolite [18]. Importantly, 2-AG released in response to vasoconstrictors (e.g., phenylephrine) acts protectively against enhanced vascular tone via CB1 receptor-mediated vasorelaxation; this mechanism has also been determined in mesenteric arteries of SHR [19]. The MAGL inhibitor JZL184 decreased HR, but not BP, in pithed rats [20]; its chronic administration diminished the enhanced BP in a mouse model of the Williams\u2013Beuren syndrome (i.e., a genetic disorder affecting the heart, the face and many other parts of the body; [21]). It is also worth noting that in normotensive rats the 2-AG levels are higher than those of AEA not only in the brain [22], but also in the heart [23,24] and in the blood vessels [19]. Hypertension by itself also affects the components of the endocannabinoid system. The AEA levels in SHR were increased in blood plasma [25] and kidneys [26], compared to the respective normotensive controls. Moreover, in patients with diagnosed hypertension, the AEA plasma level was higher and the AEA transporter activity was lower [25,27]. By contrast, other investigators found lower plasma and cardiac levels of AEA and 2-AG in SHR than in WKY, but at the same time, cardiac FAAH and MAGL levels were found to be higher [8,23]. The AEA and 2-AG levels in the aorta and mesenteric (G3) arteries isolated from SHR were higher than those measured in normotensive WKY control [19]. JZL195 is a highly potent and selective dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitor (IC50 values of 2 and 4 nM, respectively; [28]); it may have therapeutic potential as suggested by studies in animal models of pain (e.g., [29\u201331], nausea [32,33], pruritus [34], traumatic brain injury [35], Alzheimer\u2019s disease-like sporadic dementia [36] and allergic airway inflammation [37]. One might assume that the enhancement of the endocannabinoid tone by simultaneous inhibition of FAAH and MAGL might produce more pronounced positive effects on hypertension in comparison to single FAAH inhibition, namely as a result of synergistic actions of AEA and 2-AG. Moreover, dual FAAH and MAGL inhibitors are in line with the novel approach of polypharmacology, which proposes multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) as potential therapeutic agents, suitable for the treatment of complex diseases, including hypertension [38,39]. Therefore, the aim of our study is to examine the\nInt. J. Mol.

Experiments were performed on spontaneously hypertensive rats, the most common animal model of human primary hypertension [3], in which most antihypertensive drugs are active [40]. Dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitors follow the new trend in contemporary pharmacology of multi-target-directed ligands as therapeutic compounds suitable for the treatment of complex diseases, including hypertension [38,39]. We used two methods for the determination of cardiovascular parameters in conscious rats. Radiotelemetry allows continuous registration of cardiovascular parameters in freelymoving animals. The tail-cuff method allows discontinuous registration only and, in addition, is associated with stress for the rats due to their immobilization in a special holder. Interestingly, the potential hypotensive effect of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) may increase under stress both in preclinical and clinical studies [41]. The use of the tail-cuff method also allowed us to compare the influence of JZL195 with that of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 (previous studies listed in the Introduction) before and 7 and 14 days after their administration. Both under radiotelemetry and the tail-cuff method, BP was higher in SHR than in WKY. By contrast, although basal HR values, determined radiotelemetrically, were\nInt. J. Mol.

So, we next applied AUC analysis, which has the potential to disclose differences even if they are hardly detectable with other statistical methods [43]. Moreover, AUC analysis is suggested to be the best alternative for the evaluation of the behavior of the arterial pressure over a 24-h period [44]. Indeed, the AUC method allowed us to show a slight but clear dose-dependent decrease in BP and HR, observed during the 24 h after JZL195 administration in SHR but not in WKY (although the highest dose of JZL195 tended to decrease HR in WKY). In our study, we did not observe any influence of the time of the day (light/dark period) on the hemodynamic profile of JZL195. It has been shown previously that a single intravenous (i.v.) administration of the FAAH inhibitors URB597 [8] and AM3506 [9] to pentobarbital-anesthetized SHR resulted in a marked drop in BP to normotensive values. In addition, the more potent inhibitor AM3506 reduced HR. Hypotensive and bradycardic responses to AM3506 in conscious SHR lasted up to an hour [9]. None of the FAAH inhibitors affected the hemodynamic parameters in normotensive WKY. On the other hand, the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 reduced HR but not BP in normotensive pithed rats, i.e., animals in which the destruction of the central nervous system by a steel rod allowed to study the peripheral effects only [20]. We are not able to directly compare the acute cardiovascular effects of JZL195 with those determined for single FAAH or MAGL inhibitors since JZL195 was given i.p. and the previously studied FAAH or MAGL inhibitors i.v. To the best of our knowledge, the influence of MAGL or dual FAAH/MAGL inhibition on cardiovascular parameters in SHR has so far not been studied."

In mice, the highest brain levels of AEA and 2-AG were determined about 2\u20134 h after JZL195 20 mg/kg i.p., but significant inhibition of FAAH and MAGL activities still occurred even 24 h after its injection [28]. In rats, JZL195 10 mg/kg i.p. significantly enhanced depolarization-induced increases in AEA and 2-AG levels in the nucleus accumbens [46], increased the brain AEA level and attenuated anticipatory nausea [32] and produced an antinociceptive effect in mechanically evoked visceral pain [30]. In mice, chronic administration of JZL195 (20 mg/kg; i.p.) for 15 days reversed the biochemical anomalies of streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer\u2019s disease-like sporadic dementia [36]. Basal BP rose in SHR (but not in WKY) during the two weeks of the experiment, as determined under two different methods of BP measurement. Combined use of radiotelemetry and AUC analysis clearly showed that administration of JZL195 (10 mg/kg; i.p.) for two weeks prevented the above progression of hypertension in SHR without affecting the HR. In addition to total AUC, we have applied net AUC (the baseline was day 0) to present the effects of chronic administration of JZL195 on hemodynamic parameters and body weight, i.e., two parameters that increased in vehicle groups over the course of the experiment. The use of net AUC allowed us a better evaluation of the chronic JZL195 effects on the parameters under study. In addition, net AUC more readily shows the opposite influences of the vehicle and JZL195 on the parameters under study.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10942 12 of 18\nImportantly, the results obtained via the tail-cuff method also revealed that chronic treatment with JZL195 for 2 weeks not only prevented the progression of hypertension but also reduced BP in SHR by about 10\u201312%; this may be related to the stress connected with the tail-cuff method. Interestingly, as mentioned above, a hypotensive effect of another drug (the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol) occurred under stress conditions both in humans and in experimental animals [41]. In our recent study [16], in which BP was determined with the tail-cuff method only, a 2-week administration of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 did not affect BP and HR in SHR, but reduced BP in the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt model of secondary hypertension [16]. Thus, we cannot exclude a stronger antihypertensive effect of a dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitor in other models of hypertension. In the only publication describing the effects of chronic administration of a MAGL inhibitor, JZL184 (8 mg/kg; i.p.) given for 10 days normalized the enhanced SBP determined in a mouse model for the Williams-Beuren syndrome [21]. Both AEA and 2-AG are known to produce strong vasodilatory effects (see Introduction). The question arises, why does the dual inhibition of FAAH and MAGL, enzymes responsible for AEA and 2-AG degradation, produce such a weak hypotensive response? In our review, we suggested that multitarget vasodilatory (endo)cannabinoids (including AEA and 2-AG that act not only via CB1 and CB2 receptors) are not effective as antihypertensive compounds after their chronic administration, because they also induce responses increasing BP (e.g., CB1 receptors have a pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effect and stimulation of central CB1 receptors produces a pressor response; for details, see [5]). Thus, we suppose that JZL195 may lead to both depressor and pressor effects and consequently only to a slight decrease in BP. Analysis of the 24-h hemodynamic profile during the first and the last day of JZL195 treatment allows us to exclude the development of tolerance, sometimes observed for MAGL inhibition [22]. Tolerance did also not develop with respect to the antiallodynic effects of JZL195 given subcutaneously to mice (3 and 18 mg/kg for 5 days) [29]. However, the authors of the latter study did not exclude that tolerance might occur at higher doses of JZL195, since they used JZL195 at doses that were likely to produce submaximal increases in the levels of AEA and 2-AG only. The same might also be true in the case of our experiments. JZL195 failed to affect BP in WKY, regardless of whether BP was determined by radiotelemetry or by the tail-cuff method. A lack of effect or a weak fall in BP only is typical for the majority of antihypertensive compounds and is related to the low basal BP level in normotensive animals. Cannabinoids produce tachycardia in humans, but bradycardia in anesthetized and conscious experimental animals (for review, see [47]). The FAAH inhibitor AM3506 decreased HR in anesthetized and conscious SHR, but not in WKY [9]. In our hands, dosedependent weak bradycardia (or a tendency to decrease HR) was determined in SHR in the case of AUC for single JZL195 administration and in WKY in the case of AUC for the highest dose of single JZL195 administration and for chronic application of JZL195. However, JZL195 did not change HR in SHR or WKY when the tail-cuff method was used. Moreover, chronic administration of JZL195 failed to improve cardiac hypertrophy associated with hypertension in SHR. Similarly, URB597 given for two weeks did not diminish cardiac hypertrophy in SHR [16], whereas chronic JZL184 (8 mg/kg) administration for 10 days diminished the cardiac hypertrophy in a mouse model for Williams-Beuren syndrome [21]."

            "text": "As mentioned in the Introduction, the increase in endocannabinoid tone by inhibition of FAAH and MAGL represents a promising therapeutic approach in various diseases. Such a strategy allows minimizing the undesirable side effects, associated mainly with the direct stimulation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors [22,48]. Unfortunately, the first clinical trial (January 2016) of the FAAH inhibitor BIA 10-2474 led to the death of one volunteer and to\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10942 13 of 18\nthe hospitalization of another four (for review, see [22,48]). Thus, the additional aim of our study was a search for potential side effects of chronic FAAH/MAGL inhibition. SHR had lower body weight and tibia length, but higher rectal temperature and a tendency to higher levels of MDA in plasma or carbonyl groups in the heart (markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage to proteins, respectively), as shown previously [23,24,49,50]. On the other hand, blood glucose levels, as well as kidney, liver and lung weights were comparable in SHR and WKY. In our hands, chronic administration of the dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitor for 2 weeks caused only one, but not significant, visible effect apart from the modification of hemodynamic parameters. It prevented the gradual weight gain in SHR and in WKY. In another study [51], repeated daily injections of JZL195 (8 mg/kg) to mice significantly increased 2-h food intake, but did not increase 24-h food intake during a 2-week treatment period. CB1 and CB2 receptors have opposing effects on body weight. The best-known phytocannabinoid \u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u22069-THC) increases body weight via central and peripheral CB1 receptors; consequently, inverse agonism at the CB1 receptor leads to a decrease. The selective CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant was marketed for obesity treatment in Europe in 2006 and withdrawn in 2008 [52]. CB2 receptor stimulation leads to a decrease in body weight [52]. Chronic JZL195 administration, both to SHR and WKY, did not modify kidney, liver and lung weights, rectal temperature, blood glucose levels and plasma levels of two markers of oxidative stress, i.e., MDA (marker of lipid peroxidation) and protein carbonyl groups (marker of protein oxidation). However, it tended to reduce the level of protein carbonyls both in SHR and in WKY. On the other hand, it tended to increase the MDA level in WKY. Similarly, we found previously that chronic URB597 administration increased plasma MDA levels in WKY [23]. Overall, in terms of the studied physiological parameters, chronic administration of the dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitor JZL195 seems to be safe for both hypertensive and normotensive animals. Thus, we confirmed and extended the previous observations, that mice treated chronically with JZL195 (20 mg/kg; i.p. for 6 days) did not show any overt signs of toxicity or lethality [28]."

Other results may be obtained if JZL195 is administered at a higher dose or for a longer time. Moreover, additional research is needed to investigate the changes in plasma endocannabinoid levels by JZL195; at the moment, we can only assume that its effects are mediated through the increase of the endocannabinoid tone. Furthermore, the use of other models of experimental hypertension may lead to different results, e.g., as mentioned above, chronic administration of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 did not affect BP in SHR, but reduced it in the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt model of secondary hypertension [16]."

A single administration of JZL195, an MTDL which possesses the above properties, produces dose-dependent weak hypotensive and bradycardic responses in SHR but not in their normotensive controls; the hemodynamic alterations in SHR are independent of the period of the day. Chronic application of JZL195 shows only a slight hypotensive potential, which does not undergo tolerance, but effectively prevents the progression of hypertension and does not produce undesirable effects. Dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitors may become future drugs for the treatment of pain, nausea, pruritus, dementia, allergic airway inflammation and traumatic brain injury (for the literature, see Introduction and [22]).
