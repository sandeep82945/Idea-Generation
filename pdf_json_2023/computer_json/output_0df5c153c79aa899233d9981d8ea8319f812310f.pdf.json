    "abstractText": "A vibrating pylon, modeled as a waveguide, with an attached point mass that is timevarying poses a numerically challenging problem regarding the most efficient way for eigenvalue extraction. The reason is three-fold, starting with a heavy mass attachment that modifies the original eigenvalue problem for the stand-alone pylon, plus the fact that the point attachment results in a Dirac delta function in the mixed-type boundary conditions, and finally the eigenvalue problem becomes time-dependent and must be solved for a sequence of time steps until the time interval of interests is covered. An additional complication is that the eigenvalues are now complex quantities. Following the formulation of the eigenvalue problem as a system of first-order, time-dependent matrix differential equations, two eigenvalue extraction methods are implemented and critically examined, namely the Laguerre and the QR algorithms. The aim of the analysis is to identify the most efficient technique for interpreting time signals registered at a given pylon as a means for detecting damage, a procedure which finds application in structural health monitoring of civil engineering infrastructure.",

            "text": "The presence of mass attachments in structural elements such as beams and columns is quite common in civil engineering infrastructure, as is the case with pylons supporting cables, wind turbines, antennas, lights, etc., [1]. In certain cases, these mass attachments may vary with time on a scale comparable to that of the duration of the external dynamic loads. This may occur under certain conditions, as for example if the mass attachment plays the role of a damping device [2]. Specifically, pylons are infrastructure components serving a variety of functions and can be efficiently modeled as waveguides [3]. The presence of attachments on pylons leads to the concept of secondary systems, which may serve as passive or semi-active structural control devices, a typical example being liquid column dampers [4]. Furthermore, the attached mass may in turn be connected to a nonlinear spring which acts as a vibration absorber [5]. In general, it is possible to view the pylon with an attached time-variable mass as a system comprising a primary linear oscillator and a nonlinear secondary system. Much work has been done in this field from a mechanical engineering viewpoint, where the secondary system is often viewed as a Vibro-impact nonlinear energy sink [6]. As a consequence, new methods of solving the problem must be sought, such as multiple-scale expansions, which are possible for low mass ratios of the combined primary-secondary system. For heavily attached masses that are also timedependent, recourse must be made to alternative techniques [7]. Here, we solve for the time-dependent, heavy top mass on a beam element by developing a technique based on a method originally outlined in [8] and further improved in [9], whereby the free vibration\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 26. https://doi.org/10.3390/a16010026 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/algorithms\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 26 2 of 19\nboundary-value problem (BVP) of a beam with point masses is reduced to an eigenvalue problem through the separation of variables, but the characteristic equation involving transcendental functions is bypassed. Instead, the solution is expanded in series involving the eigenfunctions of the beam without any attachments, plus a new set of generalized coordinates which can be recovered from the solution of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) equations with generalized forces at the right-hand side (RHS) that correspond to the point masses. An additional complication arises when ground vibrations are considered because the motion of an attached mass on the pylon cannot be uncoupled by modal analysis, since the absolute accelerations experienced by the mass require contributions from all modes at the same instant [10]. This necessitates a second-stage modal analysis, and if the attached mass is time-dependent, then the new eigen properties of the combined system are time-dependent since they are influenced by the mass rate of change [7]. Based on this solution methodology, the transient pylon vibrations can be Fourier transformed to extract the time dependence of the eigenfrequencies of the combined pylon-mass system. The usual model for pylons is based on the Bernoulli\u2013Euler fourth-order differential equation for bending, or second order differential equations for axial and torsional responses [3]. For an effective modelling of the lumped mass, it is necessary to introduce generalized functions [11], also known as Schwartz distributions, making it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense. In this work, the inertia term that develops at the top of the beam is a temporal discontinuity, and the Dirac delta function appears as a force term on the RHS of the differential equation under study. It is noted that the Dirac delta function can also be used to model the presence of a crack in a structural member, which reduces stiffness and alters the dynamic response [12]. From the above discussion, it follows that a computationally demanding problem arises with the presence of point mass attachments in flexible structures. More specifically, the numerical complication arises from the fact that the point mass attachment is theoretically singular in space and may also exhibit a temporal singularity if the mass suddenly increases or decreases with time. Furthermore, if the magnitude of the mass attachment is large as compared to the mass of the supporting pylon, then the dynamic properties of the combined structural system change compared to the original, stand-alone beam. Thus, a time-dependent eigenvalue problem arises, which must be solved in either a direct or an iterative way, for every time step until the complete duration of the vibrations is covered. An additional issue is that the equations of motion yield an eigenvalue formulation that includes a non-symmetric damping matrix, which in turn renders the eigenvalues as complex quantities. Focusing on the eigenvalue analysis of the combined pylon-mass system, the coefficients of the polynomial resulting from setting the determinant of the system matrix equal to zero are recovered using the Leverrier\u2013Faddeev algorithm [13]. Subsequently, two eigenvalue extraction methods are examined, namely the Laguerre method, which is the complex number variant of the conventional Newton\u2013Raphson method used for real root extraction [14,15], and the QR method [16] in conjunction with the Householder algorithm [16]. Once the eigenvalue problem has been solved and followed by synthesis of the transient response of the pylon-mass system [17], then it is possible to proceed to system identification, either as a stand-alone endeavor or within the context of structural health monitoring (SHM). Typically, this entails extracting information based on the dynamic response of the monitored structure. Standard practice [18] utilizes the free vibration regime, but here the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) of the forced vibration regime is used to trace the time evolution of dominant eigenfrequencies of a pylon with a time-variable mass attached at the top. The external forcing functions are harmonic ground motion, and two cases are considered, one where the mass decreases to a nearly zero value starting from a reference value, plus the opposite case where the additional mass increases from zero to the same reference value, which can be substantial, i.e., reaching 20% of the pylon mass. These eigenfrequencies converge to the standard values computed when the additional mass has\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 26 3 of 19\na fixed value when ground motion ceases. The methodology presented herein is useful in extracting as much information as possible from dynamic responses for use in the SHM of typical civil engineering infrastructure ranging from pylons to bridges and buildings [19]."

Next, \ud835\udc62(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc61) is the displacement along the x-axis and \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc61) is the time-dependent ground motion imparted at the base, with primes (\u2032) and dots (\u2219) respectively denoting spatial and temporal derivatives. Moreover, initial conditions are assumed to be zero. It should be noted that the boundary conditions in Equation (1) have been rendered homogeneous by absorbing the lumped mass inertia effects \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc62 + \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc62 + \ud835\udc65 in the equation of motion using the Dirac delta function \ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc65). This however changes the eigenvalue problem of the original stand-alone pylon to a more complicated one and requires an additional investigation as to the number of terms required for convergence for a modal analysis [17]. Note that the presence of a point discontinuity at boundary \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc3f poses a more stringent convergence requirement as compared to the case of the discontinuity appearing in the interior 0 <\ud835\udc65 < \ud835\udc3f of the waveguide.\nFigure 1.

Next, u(x, t) is the displacement along the x-axis and xg(t) is the time-dependent ground motion imparted at the base, with primes (\u2032) and dots (\u00b7) respectively denoting spatial and temporal derivatives. Moreover, initial conditions are assumed to be zero. It should be noted that the boundary conditions in Equation (1) have been rendered homogeneous by absorbing the lumped mass inertia effects mL ( .. u + .. xg ) + . mL ( . u + . xg )\nin the equation of motion using the Dirac delta function \u03b4(x). This however changes the eigenvalue problem of the original stand-alone pylon to a more complicated one and requires an additional investigation as to the number of terms required for convergence for a modal analysis [17]. Note that the presence of a point discontinuity at boundary x = L poses a more stringent convergence requirement as compared to the case of the discontinuity appearing in the interior 0 < x < L of the waveguide."

The latter element can be considered as a tank with a valve permitting the inflow and outflow of a liquid, e.g., water. The properties of this combined structural system are listed in Table 1. Two scenarios are considered, the first for the water tank at the top being filled up from an initial mass ratio R = 0.02 (nearly empty) to a mass ratio R = 0.20 (full) with a flow rate \u00b5 = +1 tn/s. The second scenario is the reverse, starting from R = 0.20 and dropping to R = 0.02 with a flow rate \u00b5 = \u22121 tn/s.

Two mass ratios are defined here as R = m0/mP (dimensionless) and Q = \u00b5/mP (a normalized mass rate). Furthermore, \u03c9i [rad/s] are the eigenfrequencies of the stand-alone pylon. In order to recover a closedform solution, we proceed to recast the above second-order, matrix differential equation as a first-order differential equation of double size as\n[A(t)] { . y(t) } + [B(t)]{y(t)} = {0}, {y(t)}T = \u230a{ . q(t) } , {q(t)}c,\n[A] = [\n[0] [M(t)]\n[M(t)] [C]\n] , [B] = [ \u2212[M(t)]\n[0] [0] [K]\n] (7)\nThe more compact form for the above matrix equation is{ . y(t) } = \u2212 [ A\u22121(t) ] [B(t)]{y(t)} = \u2212[D(t)]{y(t)} (8)\nAt this point, we opted for a time-stepping solution of Equation (8) by defining a total time interval of interest as T = N\u2206t [s], with N the total number of time steps \u2206t. Thus, T is the time it takes for the mass ratio R to commence from an initial value and reach a final value. During a given time instant tn = tn\u22121 + \u2206t, the system matrix [D(tn)] is assumed to remain constant. Once the number of eigenvalue/eigenfunction pairs has been decided upon (in our case, i = 3), the eigenvalue problem is solved starting at time t = 0 with [D(0)] = \u2212 [ A\u22121(0) ] [B(0)]. This is continued for all time steps tn with system matrix [D(tn)], and initial conditions equal to the final conditions for the displacement and velocity of the immediately previous time step tn\u22121. In more detail, since system matrices [A(t)], [B(t)] are symmetric, a solution in the form {y(t)} = {y\u0302} exp(\u03bbt), where the carat indicates the amplitude of the kinematic variables, namely of the displacement and velocity. Upon substitution in Equation (8), the eigenvalue problem assumes its standard form as follows:\n([A(t)]\u03bb + [B(t)]){y\u0302} = {0} (9)\nSolution yields the complex-valued eigenvalues \u03bbi, i = 1, 2, 3.

Specifically, the ratio f\u0302 Ni / fi, is examined, where f\u0302 Ni is the i\u2212 th eigenfrequency recovered by either algorithm for a system matrix of size N \u00d7 N with fi is the exact value. Thus, the left column in Figure 3 plots the values of the first four eigenfrequencies recovered by the aforementioned algorithms (in red color), concurrently with the analytical solution (in black color) for a nearly zero mass ratio of R = 0.02. At the same time, the left column in Figure 3 plots the rate of convergence as the number N increases. Similarly, Figure 4 plots the same information, but for a substantial mass ratio of R = 0.20. In both cases, the rate of convergence is satisfactory and after N = 5 terms, the error is negligible. Note that both algorithms give the same ratio for size N = 2, past which the Laguerre is no longer accurate and only the Householder-QR algorithm is used."

Derivation of Spectograms For SHM purposes, it is necessary to trace the evolution of the eigenvalues of the pylon as its attached mass varies with time from tracing the transient displacement \ud835\udc62(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc61) at a given station \ud835\udc65. In reference to the pylon described in Section 2, the dynamic characteristics of the combined pylon-attached mass system vary with time and the resulting transient response is characterized from a stochastic viewpoint as non-stationary. This requires subjecting the transient signal to a series of continuous transformations to the frequency domain by implementing the short time Fourier transformation (STFT). For sufficiently small-time steps, the signal recorded within a given time interval can be considered as stationary. To this purpose, we employ the Fourier transform [22] in the following form:\n\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc53, \ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc62(\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc3f, \ud835\udf0f)\ud835\udc52 ( ) \ud835\udc4a(\ud835\udf0f \u2212 \ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf0f (26) In the above, \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc61) is a Fourier transform of the pylon displacement at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc3f, see\nEquation (5), and is known as a spectrogram. Moreover, \ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udf14/2\ud835\udf0b is the frequency (in Hz) and function \ud835\udc4a is the Hanning window within a time interval \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0f \u2212 \ud835\udc61: \ud835\udc4a(\ud835\udc5b) = 0.5 \u2212 0.5 cos(2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc57/\ud835\udc3d) , 0 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc3d (27) The width of the Hanning window is \ud835\udc3b = \ud835\udc3d + 1 and should cover at least one cycle of vibration. Fixing the window\u2019s width, as well as the placement of two consecutive windows, is a trial-and-error procedure for achieving optimal results. The derivation of a spectrogram is now given for both cases where the mass attachment on the pylon is either full of a liquid that is allowed to drain, or empty and allowed to fill. At first, Figure 6 plots the transient response at the top of the pylon following a modal analysis based on the results of the eigenvalue extraction problem. Note that when\nFigure 5.

Discussion and Conclusions This work investigates the applicability of iterative eigenvalue extraction algorithms for the purpose of structural identification. More specifically, the application example is a flexible, metallic cantilevered pylon with a time-dependent mass attachment. This specific attachment renders the eigenvalue problem time-dependent for the time duration of the action of the applied loads. Once the transient motion at a given station on the pylon is synthesized by modal analysis, the application of the short-time Fourier transform yields a clear picture of the manner in which the eigenvalues of the combined pylon-mass structural system vary during the action of ground-induced motions. Focusing on the eigenvalue analysis of the combined pylon-mass system, at first the coefficients of the polynomial resulting from setting the determinant of the first-order matrix system formulation equal to zero are recovered using the Leverrier\u2013Faddeev algorithm. This is a recursive method for calculating the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix [13]. However, these coefficients show large differences in their absolute values rendering any subsequent method for extracting eigenvalues potentially unstable. Therefore, the eigenvalue extraction is first performed by the Laguerre method, which is the complex number variant of the conventional Newton\u2013Raphson method used for real root extraction [14,15]. For the Laguerre method, an additional complication is computing the correct initial values at the beginning of each time step, which are the final values of the immediately previous time step. Next, the QR method [16] is\nFigure 7.

For the Laguerre meth d, an additional complication is computing the correct initial values at the beginning of each time step, which are the final values of the immediately previous time step. Next, the QR method [16] is implemented in conjunction with the Householder algorithm, which is the best option in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, while all limiting cases are correctly reproduced when the attached mass attains a fixed value. In general, it is estimated that three eigenvalues are necessary\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 26 18 of 19\nfor any subsequent modal analysis when the attached point mass is at a boundary, which in our case is the top of the pylon. If the mass is attached at an intermediate station on the pylon, then two eigenvalues are sufficient, which implies one can use the Laguerre method as well. At first, an analytical solution for the axial motion of the pylon modeled as a distributed mass system is derived, with the formulation augmented to handle an attached, timedependent mass attachment at the top which is heavy and cannot be viewed as a secondary system. The solution is obtained by modal analysis following the eigenvalue extraction. What complicates the solution is the fact that the mass is time-dependent, i.e., may either increase or decrease during the time interval the external forces are active. This requires a second-tier solution of a time-dependent eigenvalue problem cast as a system of first order differential equations with non-constant coefficients. Next, the eigenvalues are plotted against the time duration of the increasing/decreasing fluid flow from a container at the top of the pylon. The stiffening/softening of the combined fluid mass-pylon system is manifested as a function of fluid decrease/increase in the container. Then, the time histories at any station on the pylon for ground-induced motions can be computed by modal analysis. Finally, if structural identification is the goal, then the aforementioned time histories can be used as raw date, followed by application of the FT with Hanning windows sequentially places across the time axis. In general, the methodology developed herein is applicable to other types of structural systems with transient mass attachments and to general types of dynamic loads, including the case of a moving mass. A common case is the fixed, lumped mass at the top, which may also act as a secondary system in the case of light-weight appendages. It is also possible to augment the present formulation to model a compliant foundation by introducing equivalent soil springs at the base of the pylon, and finally to treat beams with a nonuniform cross-section. One field of application of this work is SHM for pylons used in electrified rail lines, where high frequency ground vibrations are induced in the vertical direction due to the passage of fast trains. In this case the presence of a time-variable lumped mass at the top of the pylon may either be detrimental or beneficial, depending on the frequency content of the external excitation and on the rate by which this mass increases or decreases.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; methodology, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; software, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; validation, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; formal analysis, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; investigation, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; resources, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; visualization, G.D.M. and G.I.D.; supervision, G.D.M.
