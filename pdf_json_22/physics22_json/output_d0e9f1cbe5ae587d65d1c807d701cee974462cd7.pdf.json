We show that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8-fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light-emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.\nKeywords: Halide perovskites, perovskite light-emitting transistor, dielectric metasurfaces, metatransistor.\nLight-emitting devices have become an integral part of our daily lives, where they cater to a wide range of needs, from ambient illumination in homes and workplaces to displays in televisions, mobile phones, and computer screens. With the advent of immersive visual technologies, such as virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and 3D holographic displays,1 there is a rapidly growing demand for light-emitting devices that incorporate complex functionalities to dynamically manipulate intensity, wavelength, polarization, phase, and wavefront of the emitted light. Dielectric metasurfaces, two-dimensional planar arrangements of low-loss nanoscale optical elements, are prime candidates for this endeavor: by tight confinement and manipulation of the electromagnetic fields at the subwavelength scale, they allow exerting passive and active control over the amplitude, polarization and phase of reflected, transmitted or emitted light, beyond what is possible by conventional optical elements.2\u20134\nThanks to their compatibility with a variety of nanofabrication techniques and high refractive indices, organic-inorganic halide perovskites are an ideal platform for dielectric metasurfaces. Perovskite metamaterials and metasurfaces5\u20137 for structural coloring,8 light-emission9\u201311 and chirality12 control, dynamic color displays,13,14 and lasers15,16 operating across the visible and infrared spectral range have been demonstrated recently.

Inorganic LEDs with integrated metasurfaces have shown highly polarized electroluminescence (EL) emission24, while light extraction and color purity improvement, as well as wavefront and polarization control, were attained in organic light-emitting diodes.25\u201327 The incorporation of plasmonic nanostructures on the glass substrate of organic light-emitting transistors led to directional electroluminescence.28 Emission directionality and polarization control can be achieved with different metasurface design.29,30 These functionalities were experimentally realized in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with patterned substrates.31,32 So far, all demonstrations of hybridized metasurfaces relied on nanostructured layers residing outside the active region of the light-emitting device. This is due to the poor manufacturability of the active materials as well as to the limitations imposed by the vertical device architecture of conventional LEDs, where additional interlayers may totally disrupt charge carrier transport and radiative recombination pathways within the device.\nHere we present a monolithic perovskite light-emitting metasurface transistor, or metatransistor (PeLEMT), where the metasurface is directly patterned into its channel (Fig. 1). This is made possible by the lateral design configuration of the PeLET, which borrows its architecture from conventional field-effect transistors (FETs) and emits light from the open surface between top electrodes.33\u201335 Metasurfaces consisting of arrays of nanogratings, with resonant response that can be tuned across the electroluminescence spectrum of the LET, lead to almost one order of magnitude spectral enhancement of the electroluminescence. In addition, exploiting polarization properties of the nanograting and spatial control of the recombination zone by electrical bias, we demonstrate dynamic tunability of the emission polarization from a pixelated metasurface.\niley.com /doi/10.1002/adm a.202207317 by N anyang T echnological U niversity L ee K ong C hian School O f M edicine, W iley O nline L ibrary on [03/11/2022].

            "text": "Along with improved transport characteristics, the perovskite light-emitting metatransitor showed uniform and stable, channel-wide electroluminescence. The EL intensity is clearly enhanced in the emitting regions overlapping with the metasurface array, as seen in the optical image in Fig. 3a. To study the dependence of EL enhancement and its polarization on the geometrical parameters of the nanogratings, we collected the light emitted by each metasurface through a 10x microscope objective and a polarizer. The optical modes supported by the metasurfaces are revealed by detecting two orthogonal polarizations, parallel (transverse electric, TE) and perpendicular (transverse magnetic, TM) to the nanogratings. The TE and TM electroluminescence spectra from metasurfaces of period increasing from 400 to are shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c, overlaid to the EL of the unpatterned film. The first clear manifestation of the interaction with the metasurfaces is the EL intensity enhancement induced for both TE and TM polarizations, with a distinct spectral dependence on the nanograting period. The resonant modes appear as peaks in both the TE and TM electroluminescence spectra that redshift, more or less rapidly, when the nanograting period increases from 400 to (the modes are tracked with dashed lines in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c, which\niley.com /doi/10.1002/adm a.202207317 by N anyang T echnological U niversity L ee K ong C hian School O f M edicine, W iley O nline L ibrary on [03/11/2022].

The same modes manifest, for both TE and TM, in photoluminescence, when the MAPbI3 metasurfaces are optically excited by a 405 nm laser (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Information). The excellent correspondence of the metasurface modes in photo- and electroluminescence spectra indicates that the perovskite light-emitting nanogratings behave similarly upon optical excitation or charge injection, suggesting that the metasurface is optically coupled to the light-emitting region of the metatransistor. The EL enhancement produced by the metasurfaces can be quantified by the ratio between the intensity of light emitted by the arrays and by the unstructured film, under the same electrical bias conditions. The colormap plot in Fig. 3d shows the EL enhancement as function of both emission wavelength and nanogratings period: two spectral branches corresponding to dominant metasurface modes can be clearly identified as a function of the grating period. An 8-fold enhancement of the EL intensity is reached at for a nanograting with period . Based on the ratio between polarized emission intensities, , plotted in Fig. 3e, the origin of the two branches can be attributed to the dominant TE modes of the metasurfaces. This is consistent with the photoluminescence characteristics of the nanogratings, where the TE modes are those responsible for the observed enhancement (Fig. S2c, d in Supplementary Information).\niley.com /doi/10.1002/adm a.202207317 by N anyang T echnological U niversity L ee K ong C hian School O f M edicine, W iley O nline L ibrary on [03/11/2022].

By operating the device with AC bias and varying , it is possible to arbitrarily position the recombination zone between the source and the drain terminals.34 This feature opens to the possibility to dynamically address different patterns in a spatially pixelated metasurface array. As proof of principle, here we demonstrate dynamic switching of the light polarization emitted from two nanogratings placed at different locations of the metatransistor channel.

Furthermore, charge carrier densities obtainable in LETs is several orders of magnitude greater than in conventional LEDs,44 which may lead to high brightness devices45 and possibly electrically-driven lasers.46 Direct nanopatterning of light-emitting metatransistors demonstrated here using FIB lithography could be easily up-scaled by nanoimprint lithography techniques that are routinely employed to realize perovskite metasurfaces.7 The light-emitting metatransistor device opens unlimited opportunities for integration of functional metasurfaces into electrically driven light-emitting devices. Here we demonstrated higher than 8- fold spectral enhancement and dynamic polarization switching of the electroluminescence with DOP of about 35% in pixelated devices. Development of our proof-of-principle demonstration into devices enabling practical applications will require room-temperature operation and lower driving voltages, which can be realized by employing more stable perovskites with higher luminescence quantum yield, increasing the gate capacitance and improving the device structure via asymmetric contacts, hybrid architecture, or downscaling.46,47 Furthermore, the simplicity of design and nanomanufacturing of perovskite dielectric metasurfaces will allow straightforward extension of the metatransistor concept to a plethora of functionalities for emerging visual communication technologies."

MAPbI3 thin films were fabricated from 1.2 M precursor solution of CH3NH3I\n(Dyesol) and PbI2 (99.99%, TCI) (molar ratio 1:1) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF, SigmaAldrich).

Prior to perovskite deposition, substrates were cleaned with ultrasonication for 15 min in acetone, isopropanol and deionized water. Subsequently, substrates were dried with the flow of nitrogen followed by oxygen plasma cleaning treatment. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the quartz substrates with a speed of 4900 rpm\niley.com /doi/10.1002/adm a.202207317 by N anyang T echnological U niversity L ee K ong C hian School O f M edicine, W iley O nline L ibrary on [03/11/2022].

The resulting films were finally annealed at for 15 min. Afterwards, thick Au electrodes were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask in a\nhigh vacuum ( mbar), with a deposition rate of . To avoid thermal decomposition of the perovskite films, samples were placed on a water-cooled substrate holder kept at during electrode deposition. The resulting PeLET channel length ( ) and width ( ) were and , respectively.\nMetamaterial fabrication: To complete the PeLEMT devices, arrays of grating metasurfaces were patterned on a perovskite film, between top Au electrodes, by a focused ion beam system (SEM/FIB dual beam system: Helios 600 NanoLab, FEI). The ion beam was oriented normal to the perovskite film, beam current of , ion dose of and double pass was used for the fabrication of all metasurfaces. The lateral dimension of each fabricated structure was . SEM images were acquired with the same SEM/FIB system. Cross-sectional samples were prepared by a typical FIB milling process with a Pt protective layer.\nElectrical and optical characterization: Electrical and optical characterization was carried out at\n, in the dark and under vacuum ( ) using a temperature-controlled probe stage\n(HFS600E-PB4/PB2, Linkam). DC-driven characteristics were acquired with a 2-channel precision source/measure unit (B2902A, Agilent). Charge-carrier mobilities were extracted from the forward sweeping of transfer characteristics obtained at , using the conventional equations for\nmetal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistors in the saturation regime:\n( \u221a\n)\nPhotoluminescence spectra were measured using a micro-PL setup based on an optical microscope (Eclipse LV100, Nikon) with LU plan fluor and objectives. A picosecond laser diode\n(P-C-405B, Picoquant) with repetition rate was used as the excitation source\nwhile the PL emission was detected by a fiber-coupled spectrometer (AvaSpec ULS-RS-TEC, Avantes). To ensure that fiber coupling does not introduce any spectral artefact, we ensured that the measured PL spectra are identical to those acquired using a free-space setup.\nElectroluminescence measurements were performed on the same optical setup, under AC-driven mode by applying constant drain-source bias ( ) and square wave bias on the gate\niley.com /doi/10.1002/adm a.202207317 by N anyang T echnological U niversity L ee K ong C hian School O f M edicine, W iley O nline L ibrary on [03/11/2022].

Optical images and videos were taken and acquired by a cooled sCMOS scientific camera (PCO.edge 3.1m) coupled to the optical microscope. Dynamic pixel-polarization switching EL measurements were carried out using an optical microscope (PSM-1000, Motic) with PLAN APO objective, coupled to the same spectrometer and camera. The gate bias was and the modulation frequency .\nAngle-resolved measurements: Angle-resolved reflection, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence measurements were performed with a home-built micro-spectrometer. The system consists of an inverted optical microscope (Ti-U, Nikon), a spectrograph (Andor SR-303i with 150 lines/mm grating), and an electron-multiplying charged-coupled detector (EMCCD, Andor Newton 971). A lens system along the light path between the microscope and the spectrograph was used to project the back focal plane of the collection objective (Nikon \u00d750, with numerical aperture NA=0.55) onto the slit of the spectrograph. This configuration allows spectral measurement with angular information corresponding to the NA of the objective. A linear polarizer placed on the optical path of the lens system was used to control the collection polarization. A halogen lamp was used as an excitation source in reflection measurements while in PL measurements samples were excited by the line of a cw solid state laser.\nNumerical simulations: The angle-resolved reflection spectra were computed in Comsol Multiphysics 5.4. Floquet periodic boundary conditions were used in the transverse direction, with excitation by a periodic port above the array, and a perfectly matched layer followed by a scattering boundary after the silicon substrate. The angle resolved EL spectra were calculated, by reciprocity, integrating the energy (~| | ) inside the perovskite grating metasurface at each angle of reflection, from -30 to 30. The optical constants of the perovskite film were obtained from the literature48 (Fig. S8)."
