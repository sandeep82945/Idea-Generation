This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation, and associated factors among undergraduate university students in Uganda.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduates [N = 540; 363 males; mean age = 23.3 (\u00b1 2.64) years] recruited from four universities using an online questionnaire that explored sociodemographic factors, depression, and other associated factors. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression, and Item 9 was used to assess suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation.\nResults: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 20% (n = 108) (cut-off: 10/27 based on the PHQ-9), and the prevalence of past-2-week suicidal\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 842466\nideation was 13.89% (n = 75) (cut-off: 1/3 based on the PHQ-9 Item 9). About half of the individuals who screened positive for depression had suicidal ideation. Factors associated with depression were: having relationship issues [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13\u20132.81, p = 0.012], and having a history of sexual abuse (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.10\u20133.84, p = 0.023). Factors associated with reducing the risk of depression were: satisfaction with current academic performance (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.32\u20130.79, p = 0.003), and being in the fifth year of academic study (aOR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03\u20130.73, p = 0.018). Factors associated with suicidal ideation were: smoking cigarettes and/or marijuana (aOR = 4.83, 95% CI = 1.10\u201321.12, p = 0.037), and having financial tuition constraints (aOR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.08\u20133.16, p = 0.024), However, satisfaction with current academic performance reduced the likelihood of suicidal ideation (aOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.23\u20130.70, p = 0.001).\nConclusion: Approximately one-fifth of undergraduate university students were moderately to severely depressed, especially those who had relationship issues and those with a history of sexual abuse. Suicidal ideation was common among smokers and those having financial tuition constraints. Therefore, it is recommended that the university authorities implement measures to provide psychological support for the students with problems concerning financial tuition constraints, relationships, and sexual abuse. Also, all students with depression should be screened for suicidality.\nKeywords: depression, university students, sexual abuse, academic satisfaction, COVID-19, suicidal ideation"

            "text": "Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by extreme sadness, feelings of emptiness, and/or irritable mood, accompanied by somatic and cognitive changes that significantly affect the individual\u2019s capacity to function (1). Globally, depression affects nearly 280 million people and can lead to a profound effect on all aspects of life, including a lower performance at school, poorer productivity at work, compromised relationships with family and friends, and lower ability to participate in the community (2). It was reported that Africa alone had 29.19 million cases of depression, accounting for 9% of the global depression burden (3). In Uganda, the general population prevalence was reported to be 4.6% (3). The prevalence of depression among university students in Uganda has ranged between 4.0 and 80.7% (4\u20137). The prevalence of depression in Uganda has been much higher among students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (4) and a period characterized by marked psychological stressors and suicidality among students (8\u201312).\nVarious factors have been associated with the increased prevalence of depression among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic, including being female, precariousness, previous history of psychiatric illness, social isolation, COVID19 illness, symptoms compatible with COVID-19, low quality of social relationships, low quality of COVID-19 information\nAbbreviations: BSU, Bishop Stuart University; KIU, Kampala International University Western campus; MUST, Mbarara University of Science and Technology; KU, Kabale University; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire 9.\nreceived, being a student aged 18\u201324 years, difficulties with paying for tuition fees prior to the pandemic, increased use of social media, internet use disorder, lack of physical activities/exercise, fear of COVID-19, poverty, and substance abuse (4, 13\u201316). In addition to COVID-19-related factors, several other factors have been associated with depression, including unhappy interpersonal relationships, chronic physical medical illnesses, chronic mental illnesses, low self-esteem, poor academic performance, family history of mental illness, financial constraints, insecurity at places of residence, smartphone addiction, being single, and the negative perception of the students of their learning environment (17\u201324). The effects of depression among students vary from mild effects such as poor academic performance (25) to very extreme events such as suicidal behaviors (9, 26\u201328). Previous studies have shown university students in Uganda to be at high risk of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic due to factors such as burnout, anxiety, and stress (4, 29), and such mood disorders also contribute to the increased risk of suicidal ideation (8).\nDespite the introduction of peer support systems at the universities in Uganda, the prevalence of depression increased from 4.0% in 2002 to 21.5 in 2019 and 80.7% in 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (4, 6, 7). This marked increase in the prevalence of depression over the years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, makes understanding depression among university students paramount, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Therefore, to have a better understanding of depression and suicidal ideation among students during the COVID-19 pandemic, a study among\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 842466\nfour universities in south-western Uganda was conducted during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Initially, approximately 100 students from each university (including student leaders) were invited to participate (convenience sampling). They were also asked to distribute the questionnaire among their peers in the four universities (snowball sampling). The online questionnaire collected information concerning socio-demographic characteristics of the participants and assessed depression using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).\nBasic Information of the Participants Data were collected including participant age (years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, cohabiting, married, and separated/divorced), religion (Christian, Muslim, none), the\nuniversity they were studying (BSU, KIU, MUST, KU), and type of living residence while at the university (home, hostel, rented house, university hall or other). In addition, academic information was collected, including college or faculty, the year of study, university tuition fee sponsor [private, government, nongovernment organization (NGO), loan scheme, or other], and whether the student was satisfied with their most recent academic grades. Using dichotomous (yes/no) questions, participants were also asked if they had difficulty paying tuition fees, relationship problems, and history of physical and/or sexual abuse. Similarly, data concerning health factors were obtained, such as a history of mental illness or chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV, etc.), and a history of substance use (cigarette/marijuana smoking, alcohol drinking)."

Each item has a discrete response such as 0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the days, and 3 = nearly every day. This instrument has been internationally accepted in screening for depressive symptoms with excellent psychometric properties (30, 31). In a Ugandan setting, the PHQ-9 has also been found to have excellent psychometric properties (32\u201334). At a cut-off of 10, it has high specificity (85%) and high sensitivity (88%) in detecting depression based on a meta-analysis by Levis et al. (31). The PHQ-9 has been used with university students in both Uganda (6) and south-western Uganda, therefore, its questions are culturally appropriate since the instrument had good internal reliability (35, 36). In addition, the instrument has been validated for online use (37). The PHQ-9 also categorizes depression in terms of severity. More specifically, 1\u20134 = minimal depression, 5\u20139 = mild depression, 10\u201314 = moderate depression, 15\u201319 = moderately severe depression, and 20\u201327 = severe depression (38). A cutoff score of 10 was used to determine whether participants had depressive symptoms or not. In addition, a score of one and above on Item 9, was used to indicate the presence of suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. In the present study, the Cronbach alpha was 0.85 for the PHQ-9."

Smoking cigarettes and/or marijuana, and having financial tuition constraints increased the likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation. However, similar to depression, satisfaction with the current academic performance reduced the likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, higher mental health problems have been reported among students. For instance, the prevalence of depression ranged from 46.92% to 82.4% among Bangladeshi students, as reported in a systematic review (13). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis reported a pooled prevalence of 37% depression among 436,799 students in studies published before September 20, 2020 (12). However, the depression prevalence of the present study (20%) was markedly lower than the previously reported prevalence rate of 80.7% during the first wave of the pandemic (June to July 2020) in a Ugandan study among 321 university students using the 21- item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (4). The difference may be because the present study used a different instrument to screen for depression, with different sensitivities and specificities for assessing depression. In addition, Najjuka et al.\u2019s (4) study involved all university students during the complete institutional lockdown in the first wave of the pandemic, when the levels of uncertainty about the disease were higher and there was associated higher levels of depression among students as reported by other studies (14).\nThe prevalence of depression in the present study was higher than that reported among non-medical undergraduate university students prior to the introduction of the peer counseling services at Makerere university, 2000\u20132001 at 16.2%; and medical undergraduate university students following peer counseling introduction (2002) at 4.0% (7). Despite the present study being conducted during a period when peer counseling and other psychological intervention for student mental ill-health is\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 842466\nwell established among all Ugandan universities, the prevalence of depression reported by Ovuga et al. (7) may have been lower because the study was conducted before the COVID19 pandemic\u2014a period that significantly increased negative psychological effects among many students (11). However, the depression prevalence of 20% in the present study is slightly lower than 21.5% reported in a study done the year before the pandemic (May\u2013July 2019) among 331 Makerere University medical students using the same instrument (6). The similarity between the study findings and Olum et al. (6), coupled with the significant difference from the only study assessing depression among university students during the pandemic in Uganda (4), could possibly indicate that students have adjusted to the COVID-19 situation and associated stressors, the so-called \u201cnew normal,\u201d as reported by other researchers (39). Therefore, depression may be associated with other stressors rather than being pandemic-related.\nFor instance, in the present study, depression among students was associated with having a history of sexual abuse, a finding similar to other studies among university students. It is also known that individuals who experience sexual abuse during childhood often experience associated depression in adulthood (40). In addition, the severity of depression can be accelerated by the abusive behaviors of the current sexual partner (17, 41). Since students in an abusive relationship have fewer protective factors against depression associated with a supportive romantic relationship, such as comfort, emotional support, and companionship (42). In addition, relationship problems cause significant psychological distress due to disappointment and unmet expectations (43).\nSatisfaction with academic grades appeared to be a protective factor against depression and suicidal ideation. Good academic performance is associated with being successful in life (44); therefore, an individual feels positive about their future when their performance is good, and this may help protect them from depression. Conversely, poor academic performance has consistently been associated with depression (45). In Uganda, education is considered the \u201ckey to success\u201d (46). Students are expected to meet extremely high expectations from their parents and society to succeed (47). Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that students with financial tuition constraints had an increased likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation because if they do not have the ability to fully pay for their university fees, they may lose hope for the future and experience suicidal ideation. However, it has also been reported that some students use their tuition fees to gamble, therefore, they have financial problems if they lose, leading to suicidal behaviors and suicide (48). In Uganda, law and medicine degree programs are pursued for a minimum of 5 years, and culturally these courses are associated with a successful future. Therefore, studying in the fifth-year means being near the end of the undergraduate studies for students, and the dream of future success in life is also nearing. Other researchers studying Ugandan university students have also reported the protective nature of being in the final year against depression during the COVID-19 pandemic (4). Also, by the time a student reaches the fifth year of study, they have been more likely to be exposed to all the conditions around campus and developed coping\nmechanisms against depression. For example, some have already coped with experiencing romantic breakups, poverty while on campus, and have gotten a peer support system through the friends they acquired over the years.\nJust under half of the participants who screened positive for depression reported suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks (45.37%). This was similar to 48.4% of individuals with major depressive disorder at a mental health facility in Ethiopia (49). The prevalence of suicidal ideation in the present study (13.89%) was lower than 22.7% from a study conducted among university students in another African country, Libya, during the COVID19 pandemic in the months of April and May 2020 based on Item 9 of the PHQ-9 (50). This difference in prevalence rates may be due to the following reasons: (1) during the time of data collection, Libya was still experiencing a civil war which comes with multiple mental challenges, including thoughts of suicide, (ii) the study was done at a period when individuals worldwide were having higher levels of stress, anxiety, suicidal behaviors and other mental challenges (i.e., early stages of the pandemic) (51); and (iii) the sample only involved medical students who have been reported to experience higher suicidal behaviors compared to other students (52\u201354).\nThe prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks in the present study was also lower than 18.04% in a US study involving college students during the month of May 2020 (55). However, the prevalence was higher than 12.9 and 7.3% from studies among university students in China during February and March 2020, respectively (56, 57). Despite the studies in China being conducted earlier, the students were exposed to constant sources of stress during the pandemic, and they would have developed coping strategies to overcome stress complications such as depression and related suicidal behaviors. Smoking cigarettes and/or marijuana was associated with suicidal ideation, a finding consistent with other studies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (58). Substance use increased during the COVID19 pandemic and led to multiple mental challenges, including suicide (59\u201363). Many individuals use addictive substances to cope with stress, and marijuana, in particular, was believed by some Ugandans to treat COVID-19 symptoms (61). Some of the individuals trying to cope with stress by using psychoactive substances could have had suicidal ideation not secondary to the smoking of substances."

            "heading": "LIMITATIONS",
            "text": "The present study has a number of limitations. First, it was crosssectional; therefore, causal relationships between the variables cannot be determined. Second, the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could also independently cause depression among some university students due to uncertainty about their academic progress, source of income, their jobs (for the employed participants), and worries about life. Third, another issue was that anyone who was given access to the survey weblink could respond to it; therefore, there is no guarantee that all responses were from university students only. Fourth, the study design relied on the participants\u2019 memory, which is subject\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 842466\nto recall bias. Fifth, this study did not access all the potential variables that could have led to an increase in depression among university students such as disruption of face-to-face teaching classes. Future research should explore these factors to better understand the factors related to depression and the pandemic to reduce such mental consequences in future pandemics. Finally, the study design did not allow for the determination of a true response rate since WhatsApp and emails are unable to track the number of individuals who viewed the link, especially when shared through groups."

            "text": "The present study found a lower prevalence of depression among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to pre-pandemic prevalence among university students, and this was associated with having had relationship problems and a history of sexual abuse. However, being satisfied with current academic performance and studying in the fifth year appeared to be protective factors. Therefore, universities in Uganda should implement measures to provide psychological support for students with problems concerning tuition fee challenges, relationships, and past sexual abuse. These can include peer support groups and routine talks about dating and relationships to prepare the students for any outcome. In addition, finalists should be encouraged to mentor other students and teach them strategies to overcome some of the psychological stressors experienced while at university. Also, all students with depression should be screened for suicidal behaviors."
