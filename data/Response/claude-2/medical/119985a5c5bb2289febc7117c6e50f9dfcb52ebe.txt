 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the long-term cycling stability and reliability of the flame retardant PCMs when used for battery thermal management. Conduct cycling tests over hundreds to thousands of cycles to determine if the thermal performance remains consistent. 

2. Explore different bio-based flame retardants, such as lignin or cellulose derivatives, to create environmentally friendly PCMs with high flame retardancy. Evaluate their synergistic effects with APP and thermal/flame retardant properties.

3. Optimize the composition ratios of the flame retardant PCMs to further enhance thermal conductivity while maintaining high latent heat capacity. Experiment with different loadings and combinations of thermally conductive fillers.

4. Incorporate the flame retardant PCMs into different battery module and pack architectures. Assess their performance for cooling larger modules and packs with higher energy densities. 

5. Investigate the long-term chemical compatibility and interactions between the flame retardant PCMs and battery components. Test for any detrimental effects on battery materials after prolonged direct contact.
