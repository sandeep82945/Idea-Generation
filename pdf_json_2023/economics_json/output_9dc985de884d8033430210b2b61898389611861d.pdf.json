Elasticity is an economics concept that measures the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable. Elasticity is a function e\u00f0x\u00de that can be built from an arbitrary function y = g\u00f0x\u00de. Elasticity at a certain point is usually calculated as e\u00f0x\u00de = \u00f0dy/dx\u00de\u00f0x/y\u00de. Elasticity can be expressed in many forms. An interesting form, from an economic point of view, is the ratio between the derivative of the logarithm of the distribution function with respect to the logarithm of the point x, which is developed in this article. The aim of this article is to study the direction of variation of this elasticity function and to construct a nonparametric estimator because the estimators that have been constructed so far are parametric estimators and admit many deficiencies in practice. And finally, we study the strong consistency of the said estimator. A numerical study was carried out to verify the adequacy of the theory.",

Introduction\nWe know well that the distribution of a random variable can be defined by the distribution function, the probability density function, or the characteristic function. However, they are not the only functions to describe the distribution of a random variable. Thus, other functions exist which are also widely used to define a distinctive character of a random variable, in particular, the survival or reliability function, the odds function, the risk function, and the inverse risk function. As usual,Xis a continuous random variable representing the lifetime of a component, and its distribution is denoted byF. We further assume that F has a density function f . We define (see Veres-Ferrer and Pav\u00eda [1]) \u2200x > 0: the reliability/survival function of X at x is S\u00f0x\u00de = 1 \u2212 F\u00f0x\u00de; the failure rate of X at x is h\u00f0x\u00de = f \u00f0x\u00de/S\u00f0x\u00de; the reversed hazard rate function of X at x is r\u00f0x\u00de = f \u00f0x\u00de/F\u00f0x\u00de; and the cumulative hazard rate function of X at x is H\u00f0x\u00de = \u00d0 x0h\u00f0t\u00de dt. These aforementioned functions are introduced in the\nliterature, are often found in the field of actuarial science (see Steffensen [2]), and are commonly used in survival analysis (see Lee and Wang [3]). The hazard rate (HR) plays a crucial role in reliability and survival analysis, as it defines the conditional probability of failure of an object in \u00bdt ; t + dt given that it did not fail before in \u00bd0 ; t . This property leads to many useful features, as for instance, the possibility of modeling the impact of an environment by a proportional hazard model. It is also well known that the hazard rate uniquely defines the distribution function of the time to failure random variable via the basic exponential formula. The reversed hazard rate (RHR) or reversed hazard function is a less intuitive function. It could be interpreted as the conditional probability of the state change happening in an infinitesimal interval preceding x, given that the state change takes place at x or before x. In other words, the RHR is defined as the ratio of the probability density function and the corresponding distribution function, and thus in a reliability setting, it defines the conditional probability of a\nHindawi Journal of Applied Mathematics Volume 2023, Article ID 1346602, 14 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/1346602\nfailure of an object in \u00bdt \u2212 dt ; t given that the failure had occurred in \u00bd0, t . The reversed hazard rate (RHR) can be treated as the instantaneous failure rate occurring immediately before the time point x (the failure occurs just before the time point x, given that the unit has not survived longer than time x). Recently, the properties of the reversed hazard rate (RHR) have attracted considerable interest of researchers (see Chandra and Roy [4] and Finkelstein [5]). Despite being a dual function to the hazard rate to a certain extent, its typical behavior makes it suitable for assessing waiting time, hidden failures, inactivity times, and the study of systems, including optimizing reliability and the probability of successful functioning.\nThe elasticity function of X is also introduced in the literature (see Veres-Ferrer and Pav\u00eda [1]) and is defined as follows:\ne x\u00f0 \u00de = \u2212x S\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de F x\u00f0 \u00de = \u2212x 1 \u2212 F x\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\u2032 F x\u00f0 \u00de = x f x\u00f0 \u00de F x\u00f0 \u00de = d log F x\u00f0 \u00de d log x , \u2200x > 0:\n\u00f01\u00de\nElasticity is one of the most important concepts in economic theory. For example, in economics, if x is the price of a commodity and F\u00f0x\u00de denotes the demand on that commodity, then the \u201celasticity\u201d of the demand is defined by (1). In other words, elasticity measures how sensitive an output variable is to changes in an input variable and is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable. Lariviere and Porteus [6] adopt this concept and apply it to the supply chain management. The elasticity of a random distribution expresses the changes that the distribution function undergoes when faced with variations in the random variable, that is, how the accumulation of probability behaves throughout the domain of the variable. The elasticity function of a distribution shows the behavior of the accumulation of probability in the domain of the random variable. In this paper, in the first part, we make an in-depth study of the asymptotic behavior on the elasticity function with some simulations of this function in order to illustrate the variations of the said function. In practice, elasticity functions are not constant; even in economics, they vary as one moves along the demand curve and the only class where the elasticity is constant is the class where the demand function g\u00f0x\u00de = ax\u2212c, where x is the price and a and c are positive constants. Elasticity in econometrics makes it possible to estimate a production function, for example, of the nonlinear type of Cobb-Douglass (see Felipe and Adams [7]). The estimation of production functions is a very delicate exercise. Thus, the estimation by the parametric method of elasticity leads to an estimation of production functions with larger biases apart from the bias of measurement errors, the main ones being the bias of omitted variables, bias of specification, and bias of selection (see Griliches and Mairesse [8]). Most of the time, the data collected is incomplete data (often censored data). Consequently, to overcome these problems of bias induced on the estimation of the production function, we propose, in the second part or study, a nonparametric estimator based on the kernel estimation presence of incomplete data more precisely censored data not informative.\n2. Behavior of Elasticity for Some Standard Distributions\nWe know that the functions HR and RHR are, respectively, defined by\nh x\u00f0 \u00de = f x\u00f0 \u00de S x\u00f0 \u00de , r x\u00f0 \u00de = f x\u00f0 \u00de F x\u00f0 \u00de = f x\u00f0 \u00de 1 \u2212 S x\u00f0 \u00de ,\u2200 x > 0: \u00f02\u00de\nBy substituting HR in RHR, RHR can be expressed as\nr x\u00f0 \u00de = h x\u00f0 \u00de S\u22121 x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1 = h x\u00f0 \u00de eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1 : \u00f03\u00de\nFrom the formula of elasticity (1), we note that\ne x\u00f0 \u00de = x f x\u00f0 \u00de F x\u00f0 \u00de = xr x\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f04\u00de\nWe deduce from (3) and (4) that the elasticity function can be written in the form\ne x\u00f0 \u00de = x h x\u00f0 \u00de eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1 : \u00f05\u00de\nBy differentiating expression (4) with respect to x, we have\ne\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = r x\u00f0 \u00de + xr\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f06\u00de\nUsing formula (3) of RHR, we can write\ne\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = h x\u00f0 \u00de eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1 + x h\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1\u00c0 \u00c1 \u2212 h2 x\u00f0 \u00deeH x\u00f0 \u00de eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1 \u00c0 \u00c12 , \u00f07\u00de\nwhich can be simply written in the form\ne\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = h x\u00f0 \u00de + xh\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xh2 x\u00f0 \u00de h i eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1 \u00c0 \u00c1\n\u2212 xh2 x\u00f0 \u00de eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1 \u00c0 \u00c12 : \u00f08\u00de\nWe know that by definition, the elasticity function is defined for strictly positive random variables (as always in survival or reliability analysis); we will seek the direction of variation of the elasticity for most of the standard distributions used in survival or reliability analysis which are defined on a domain contained in \u211d+.\nIn formula (8), it is clear that the sign of e\u2032\u00f0x\u00de depends on that of the numerator expression. In the rest of this paragraph, we will focus on the numerator of equality (8), in order to be able to quickly deduce the sign of e\u2032\u00f0x\u00de. 2.1. Uniform Distribution. If X is a random variable such that X\u21ddU\u00f0\u00bda ; b \u00de, then we have for x \u2208 \u00bda ; b where 0 < a < b :\nf x\u00f0 \u00de = 1 b \u2212 a , F x\u00f0 \u00de = x \u2212 a b \u2212 a :\n\u00f09\u00de\nNote that the HR h\u00f0x\u00de and the cumulative HR H\u00f0x\u00de exist if and only if x \u2260 b; it means x \u2208 \u00bda ; b\u00bd. So we have\nh x\u00f0 \u00de = 1 b \u2212 x ,\nH x\u00f0 \u00de = log b \u2212 a b \u2212 x :\n\u00f010\u00de\nFrom above results, we obtain\nh x\u00f0 \u00de + xh\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xh2 x\u00f0 \u00de h i eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1\n= x \u2212 a b \u2212 x\u00f0 \u00de2 , \u00f011\u00de\nand the numerator of equality (8) gives\nh x\u00f0 \u00de + xh\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xh2 x\u00f0 \u00de h i eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1\n\u2212 xh2 x\u00f0 \u00de = \u2212a b \u2212 x\u00f0 \u00de2 < 0:\n\u00f012\u00de\nEquation (12) shows that the elasticity is decreasing function for the uniform distribution.\n2.2. Weibull Distribution. Special cases of the Weibull include the exponential \u00f0\u03b2 = 1\u00de and the Rayleigh distributions \u00f0\u03b2 = 2\u00de. If X is a random variable such that X\u21ddW \u00f0\u03b2, \u03b8\u00de, where \u03b2 > 0 and \u03b8 > 0 are shape and scale parameters, then we have \u2200x \u2265 0:\nf x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b2 x \u03b2\u22121\n\u03b8\u03b2 e\u2212 x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de \u03b2 ,\nF x\u00f0 \u00de = 1 \u2212 e\u2212 x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de\u03b2 , S x\u00f0 \u00de = e\u2212 x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de\u03b2 ,\nh x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b2 x \u03b2\u22121\n\u03b8\u03b2 ,\nH x\u00f0 \u00de = x \u03b8 \u03b2 :\n\u00f013\u00de\nUsing the same formulas (6) and (5), we have\ne\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b2x\u03b2\u22121 e x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de \u03b2 \u2212 1 + \u03b2x\u03b2\u22121e x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de\u03b2 \u03b2 \u2212 1\u00f0 \u00de 1 \u2212 e\u2212 x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de\u03b2 \u2212 x\u03b2\u22121e x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de \u03b2 \u03b2 x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de\u03b2\n\u03b8\u03b2 e t/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de \u03b2 \u2212 1 2 , \u00f014\u00de\nor\ne\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b22x\u03b2\u22121e t/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de\n\u03b2 1 \u2212 x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de\u03b2 \u2212 e\u2212 x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de\u03b2 h i\n\u03b8\u03b2 e t/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de \u03b2 \u2212 1\n2 : \u00f015\u00de\nLet\u03c8\u00f0x\u00de = 1 \u2212 \u00f0x/\u03b8\u00de\u03b2 \u2212 e\u2212\u00f0x/\u03b8\u00de\u03b2 .

Burr Distribution. In statistics and econometrics, the Burr distribution is a continuous probability law depending on three positive real parameters. It is commonly used to study household income. If X is a random variable such that X\u21ddB\u00f0\u03b1, \u03bb, \u03ba\u00de, then we have for x \u2265 0\nf x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b1\u03ba\u03bb \u03b1x\u03ba\u22121\n\u03bb + x\u03ba\u00f0 \u00de\u03b1+1 ,\nF x\u00f0 \u00de = 1 \u2212 \u03bb \u03bb + x\u03ba \u03b1 ,\nS x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03bb \u03bb + x\u03ba \u03b1 ,\n\u00f016\u00de\nand we deduce\nh x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b1\u03bax \u03ba\u22121\n\u03bb + x\u03ba ,\nH x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b1 log \u03bb + x \u03ba\n\u03bb\n:\n\u00f017\u00de\nNote that the Burr distribution generalizes certain distributions in probability theory. We have the following:\n(1) If k = 1, the Burr distribution is the generalized Pareto distribution\n(2) If \u03b1 = 1, the Burr distribution is the log-logistic distribution\n(3) If \u03b1\u27f6 +\u221e, the Burr distribution is the Weibull distribution\nNow, we obtain\nh x\u00f0 \u00de + xh\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xh2 x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b1\u03bb\u03ba 2x\u03ba\u22121\n\u03bb + x\u03ba\u00f0 \u00de2 : \u00f018\u00de\nWith the numerator of equality (8), we obtain\nh x\u00f0 \u00de + xh\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xh2 x\u00f0 \u00de h i eH x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1 \u2212 xh2 x\u00f0 \u00de\n= \u03b1\u03ba 2x\u03ba\u22121 \u03bb \u2212 \u03b1x\u03ba\u00bd \u03bb + x\u03ba\u00f0 \u00de2 \u03bb + x\u03ba \u03bb \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03bb\u03ba2x\u03ba\u22121 \u03bb + x\u03ba\u00f0 \u00de2 = \u03b1\u03ba 2x\u03ba\u22121\n\u03bb + x\u03ba\u00f0 \u00de2 \u03bb \u2212 \u03b1x\u03ba\u00f0 \u00de \u03bb + x \u03ba \u03bb \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb :\n\u00f019\u00de\nThe last equality shows that the sign of e\u2032\u00f0x\u00de depends on \u03c4\u00f0x\u00de = \u00f0\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1x\u03ba\u00de\u00f0\u00f0\u03bb + x\u03ba\u00de/\u03bb\u00de\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb:\nWith \u03c4\u2032\u00f0x\u00de = \u2212\u00f0\u03b1\u00f0\u03b1 + 1\u00de\u03bax2\u03ba\u22121\u00de/\u00f0\u03bb + x\u03ba\u00de\u00f0\u00f0\u03bb + x\u03ba\u00de/\u03bb\u00de\u03b1 \u2264 0 and \u03c4\u00f00\u00de = 0, we therefore deduce that the elasticity is a decreasing function for the Burr distribution.\n2.4. Gamma Distribution. A random variable X\u21dd\u0393\u00f0k, \u03b8\u00de with parameters k and \u03b8 (strictly positive) if its probability density function can be put in the form\nf x\u00f0 \u00de = x k\u22121e\u2212x/\u03b8\n\u03b8k\u0393 k\u00f0 \u00de , where\u0393 k\u00f0 \u00de = \u00f0\u221e 0 xk\u22121e\u2212xdx: \u00f020\u00de\nSo we get\nF x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03b3 k, x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de \u0393 k\u00f0 \u00de ,\nr x\u00f0 \u00de = x k\u22121e\u2212x/\u03b8\n\u03b8k\u03b3 k, x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de ,\n\u00f021\u00de\nwhere \u03b3 k, z\u00f0 \u00de = \u00f0z 0 xk\u22121e\u2212xdx, such that \u03b3 k,+\u221e\u00f0 \u00de = \u0393 k\u00f0 \u00de and \u03b3 k, 0\u00f0 \u00de = 0:\n\u00f022\u00de\nAdditionally, we have\nr\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = e \u2212x/\u03b8\n\u03b8k k \u2212 1\u00f0 \u00dexk\u22122 \u2212 1/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00dexk\u22121\u00c2 \u00c3\u03b3 k, x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1/\u03b8k x2k\u22122e\u2212x/\u03b8 \u03b32 k, x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de ,\nxr\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = x k\u22121e\u2212x/\u03b8\n\u03b8k\nk \u2212 1\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00dex\u00bd \u03b3 k, x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 1/\u03b8k xke\u2212x/\u03b8\n\u03b32 k, x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de :\n\u00f023\u00de\nThese last two equalities in formula (6) provide the expression for e\u2032\u00f0x\u00de in the following form:\ne\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = x k\u22121e\u2212x/\u03b8\n\u03b8k\u03b32 k, x/\u03b8\u00f0 \u00de k \u2212 x \u03b8 \u03b3 k, x \u03b8 \u2212 1 \u03b8k xke\u2212x/\u03b8 : \u00f024\u00de\nWe observe that e\u2032\u00f0x\u00de has the same sign as \u03c6\u00f0x\u00de = \u00f0k \u2212 \u00f0x/\u03b8\u00de\u00de\u03b3\u00f0k, x/\u03b8\u00de \u2212 \u00f01/\u03b8k\u00dexke\u2212x/\u03b8 with \u03c6\u2032\u00f0x\u00de = \u2212\u00f01/\u03b8\u00de\u03b3\u00f0k, x/\u03b8\u00de \u2264 0 and \u03c6\u00f00\u00de = 0: We therefore come to the conclusion that the elasticity is a decreasing function for the Gamma distribution. Also, remember the following:\n(1) If k = 1, the Gamma distribution is exponential distribution\n(2) If k = \u03bd/2 and \u03b8 = 2, the Gamma distribution is a chisquare distribution with \u03bd degree of freedom\n(3) If k \u2208\u2115 \\ f0 ; 1g, the Gamma distribution is the Erlang distribution\n2.5. Log-Normal Distribution. The log-normal distribution, also called the Galton distribution denoted as log \u2212N \u00f0\u03bc, \u03c32\u00de,\nis a distribution that is also widely used in reliability and survival analysis. It is defined for strictly positive random variables whose distribution function and probability density are defined by\nf x\u00f0 \u00de = 1 x\u03c3 ffiffiffiffiffi 2\u03c0 p e\u22121/2 log x\u2212\u03bc\u00f0 \u00de/\u03c3\u00f0 \u00de2 ,\nF x\u00f0 \u00de = 12 + 1 2 erf log x \u2212 \u03bc \u03c3 ffiffi 2 p\n\u2200x > 0, \u00f025\u00de\nwhere erf is the Gaussian error function defined by erf \u00f0x\u00de = 2/ ffiffiffi\u03c0p \u00d0 x0e\u2212t2dt.\nSo we have\ne x\u00f0 \u00de = x f x\u00f0 \u00de F x\u00f0 \u00de =\n1/\u03c3 ffiffiffiffiffi 2\u03c0 p e\u22121/2 log x\u2212\u03bc\u00f0 \u00de/\u03c3\u00f0 \u00de 2\nF x\u00f0 \u00de , with limx\u27f6+\u221ee x\u00f0 \u00de\n= 0 and lim x\u27f60+ e x\u00f0 \u00de = 00 : \u00f026\u00de\nTo evaluate the indeterminate form of the last limit above, we then apply the Hospital rule which gives\nlim x\u27f60+ e x\u00f0 \u00de = lim x\u27f60+ \u03bc \u2212 log x \u03c32 = +\u221e: \u00f027\u00de\nWe observe that the function e\u00f0x\u00de decreases from infinity to 0. However, this observation is silent on the direction of variation, i.e., whether it decreases monotonically or not. Thus, we have to trust the derivative e\u2032\u00f0x\u00de to see if it is less than 0, which means that it decreases monotonically according to the results of the limits.\nUsing formula (6), we can write\ne\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = \u2212 f x\u00f0 \u00de F2 x\u00f0 \u00de log x \u2212 \u03bc \u03c32 F x\u00f0 \u00de + xf x\u00f0 \u00de : \u00f028\u00de\nWe notice in this last equality that e\u2032\u00f0x\u00de \u2264 0 if and only if \u03c1\u00f0x\u00de = \u00bd\u00f0\u00f0log x \u2212 \u03bc\u00de/\u03c32\u00deF\u00f0x\u00de + xf \u00f0x\u00de \u2265 0:\nSo the derivative of \u03c1 gives\n\u03c1\u2032 x\u00f0 \u00de = 1 x\u03c32 F x\u00f0 \u00de + log x \u2212 \u03bc \u03c32 f x\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 f x\u00f0 \u00de 1 + log x \u2212 \u03bc \u03c32 ,\n\u00f029\u00de\n= 1 x\u03c32 F x\u00f0 \u00de > 0;\u2200x > 0: \u00f030\u00de\nMoreover, we have to calculate the limit at 0+ of two functions which compose the function \u03c1, i.e.,\n\u03c1 x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03c1 x\u00f0 \u00de + xf x\u00f0 \u00de avec \u03c1 x\u00f0 \u00de = log x \u2212 \u03bc \u03c32 F x\u00f0 \u00de et lim x\u27f60+ xf x\u00f0 \u00de = 0:\n\u00f031\u00de\nThe limit at 0+ of \u03c1\u00f0x\u00de gives an indeterminacy in the form 0 \u00d7\u221e. We know that the indeterminations of the form 0 \u00d7 \u00b1\u221e are reduced to an indeterminacy of the form 0/0 or of the form \u221e/\u221e by noting that a multiplication by 0 is equivalent to a division by infinity or that a multiplication by infinity is equivalent to a division by 0. We can rewrite \u03c1\u00f0x\u00de in the following form:\n\u03c1 x\u00f0 \u00de = u x\u00f0 \u00de v x\u00f0 \u00de = log x \u2212 \u03bc \u03c32/F x\u00f0 \u00de , where u x\u00f0 \u00de\n= log x \u2212 \u03bc and v x\u00f0 \u00de = \u03c3 2 F x\u00f0 \u00de , \u00f032\u00de\nto have the form \u221e/\u221e in order to apply the Hospital rule. Note that\nxf x\u00f0 \u00de = \u2212 log x \u2212 \u03bc \u03c32 f x\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f033\u00de\nApplying the Hospital rule twice successively, we get\nlim x\u27f60+ \u03c1 x\u00f0 \u00de = lim x\u27f60+ \u2212F2 x\u00f0 \u00de \u03c32xf x\u00f0 \u00de = limx\u27f60+ 2F x\u00f0 \u00de log x \u2212m = 0: \u00f034\u00de\nEquations (30), (31), and (34) prove that the elasticity is a monotonically decreasing function for the log-normal distribution.\nTraditionally in economics or finance or in actuarial science, as the main quantities of interest are costs or durations, the most used probability laws are those with positive support. The four most common positive distributions are Gamma, Burr, log-normal, and Weibull. The theoretical curves in Figure 1 were produced using R and MATLAB software (for the Burr distribution, which is not defined in R). Moreover, we notice that whatever the different values of the parameters of each distribution, the elasticity function is a monotonically decreasing function.\nRemark 1. In this paragraph, we were able to demonstrate that the elasticity function is a monotonically decreasing function, at least, for most of the standard distributions that we know. Thus until proof to the contrary, we estimate that the elasticity function, in view of the results obtained in this part, would be an always monotonic decreasing function as shown in Figure 1. The monotony of the elasticity has no influence on the construction of its estimator. However, the monotony facilitates the difficulties of simulations because there are fewer disturbances.\nThe following paragraph gives a nonparametric estimation based on the kernel method and a study on the almost sure convergence of the said estimator. The nonparametric kernel estimation approach, unlike the parametric approach, does not require any assumptions about the true probability law of the observations, and this is its main advantage. It is therefore a problem of functional estimation; for example, this implies that the elasticity function which is continuous will be estimated by a discontinuous function. Another such approach is that accuracy is better if one has a larger number\nof observations. It gives a better estimate with regard to the minimization of the biases and allows a very good smoothing for the estimator, and it contributes to the robustness of the estimator.\n3. Statistical Inference on the Elasticity Function\nWe know that in most cases, the data collected is not complete, which leads us to carry out a study on incomplete data. There are several types of incomplete data including censored data. Moreover, the elasticity can depend on a covariate which can represent a given situation or a given state, for example, generally the case of the elasticity of the demand compared to the income (i.e., when the income increases, in most cases, the demand also increases); the covariate can represent the seasonal period or the geographical location, etc. In this part, we will define a nonparametric estimator of the conditional elasticity function in the case of the right censored data.\n3.1. Theoretical Study. Consider n pairs of independent random variables \u00f0Xi, Ti\u00de for i = 1,\u22ef, n that we assume drawn from the pair \u00f0T , X\u00de which is valued in \u00bd0;+\u221e\u00bd \u00d7\u211d. In this paragraph, we consider the problem of nonparametric estimation of the conditional density of Y given X = x when the response variable Yi is rightly censored. Consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables \u00f0Ti\u00dei=1,\u22ef,n with a common unknown conditional distribution function F\u00f0:jx\u00de and density function f \u00f0:jx\u00de. Furthermore, we denote by \u00f0Ci\u00dei=1,\u22ef,n the censoring random variables which are supposed independent and identically distributed with a common unknown continuous distribution function G, and its conditional version is noted G\u00f0:jx\u00de. Thus, we construct our estimators by the observed variables \u00f0Xi, Yi, \u03b4i\u00dei=1,\u22ef,n, where Yi = Ti\u2227Ci and \u03b4 = 1Ti\u2264Ci , where 1A denotes the indicator function of the set A. We assume that \u00f0Ci\u00de1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and \u00f0Ti, Xi\u00de1\u2264i\u2264n are independent. The function G = 1 \u2212G, of the censoring random variables, is estimated by Kaplan and Meier [9] estimator defined as follows:\nGn t\u00f0 \u00de = Yn i=1 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b4 i\u00f0 \u00de n \u2212 i + 1 1 Y i\u00f0 \u00de\u2264tf g if t \u2264 Y n\u00f0 \u00de,\n0 otherwise,\n8>< >:\n\u00f035\u00de\nwhere Y \u00f01\u00de < Y \u00f02\u00de <\u22ef < Y \u00f0n\u00de are the order statistics of \u00f0Yi\u00de1\u2264i\u2264n and \u03b4\u00f0i\u00de is the concomitant of Y \u00f0i\u00de. Gn is known to be uniformly convergent to G.\nLet L\u00f0tjx\u00de = P\u00bdY \u2264 tjX = x be the conditional distribution function of Y given X = x and L1\u00f0tjx\u00de = P\u00bdY \u2264 t ; \u03b4 = 1jX = x = \u00d0 t 0\u00f01 \u2212G\u00f0ujx\u00de\u00dedF\u00f0ujx\u00de be the conditional subdistribution function of the uncensored observation \u00f0Y ; \u03b4 = 1\u00de given X = x, and let f \u22c6\u00f0tjx\u00de = f \u00f0tjx\u00de\u00f01 \u2212 G\u00f0tjx\u00de\u00de be its corresponding conditional subdensity function. Furthermore, under the\nrandom censoring scheme, it is clear that the Yi are i.i.d. with common conditional distribution function L which satisfies\n1 \u2212 L tjx\u00f0 \u00de = 1 \u2212 F tjx\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de 1 \u2212 G tjx\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de, \u00f036\u00de\nand the uncensored model is the special case of the censored\nmodel with G = 0.

The conditional cumulative hazard function H\u00f0tjx\u00de is assumed to be strictly positive and there is a constant \u03bd > 0 such that 0 < f \u00f0tjx\u00de < \u03bd \u2200\u00f0t ; x\u00de \u2208 I \u00d7 \u0394:\n(2) The Kernel Assumptions. K1. K is a symmetric kernel of bounded variation on \u211d vanishing outside the interval \u00bdM,+M for some M > 0 satisfying\n(i) \u00d0 \u211dK\u00f0u\u00de = 1\n(ii) \u00d0 \u211duK\u00f0u\u00de = 0\n(iii) \u00d0 \u211du 2K\u00f0u\u00de = \u03b1\u00f0K\u00de > 0\nK 2.

The assumptions A1, A4-A5, K1-K2, and H1 are quite standard. A1-A2, A4-A5, K1-K2, and H1-H2 insure the strong uniform convergence of the estimators Ln\u00f0tjx\u00de and L1n\u00f0tjx\u00de to L\u00f0tjx\u00de and L1\u00f0tjx\u00de, respectively, as in (39) and (40), while assumptions A2-A3, K1-K3, H1, and H3 ensure the strong uniform convergence of f \u22c6n\u00f0tjx\u00de to f \u22c6\u00f0tjx\u00de; then, these two convergences lead to the strong consistency from en\u00f0tjx\u00de to e\u00f0tjx\u00de.\n3.1.2. Strong Consistency. In this subsection, we prove the consistency of our estimator and give a rate of convergence. Our first result is the almost sure uniform convergence with an appropriate rate of the cumulative hazard function estimator Hn\u00f0tjx\u00de stated in Proposition 4, which is the key for investigating the strong consistency of en\u00f0tjx\u00de and the almost sure uniform convergence of f \u22c6n\u00f0tjx\u00de given by Proposition 3. The second and last results deal with the strong consistency of the conditional elasticity function estimator en\u00f0tjx\u00de given by Theorem 6.\nProposition 3.

Since the random variable T is supposed to be nonnegative, we choose \u03c3 such that T is positive. Thus, each model corresponds to its\u03c3. In our study, we chose \u03c3 = 0:15with\nX\u21ddN \u00f00, 1\u00de normal distribution for the model MP, \u03c3 = 0:90 withX\u21ddN \u00f00, 1\u00de normal distribution forME and \u03c3 = 0:50with X\u21ddLN \u00f00, 1\u00de lognormal distribution forML. Like the variable T, the censoring variable C is assumed to be nonnegative. Here, the random variable C follows a lognormal distribution LN \u00f00, \u03c32c \u00de. Then, we considered the theoretical conditional\nelasticity function to be estimated, resulting from the lognormal distribution, i.e., the conditional probability density of T given X = x is that of the lognormal distribution with mean mT\u00f0x\u00de = 0:01 \u2212 0:2x and standard deviation \u03c3T\u00f0x\u00de = 3 with x \u2208 f1:50 ; 1:88 ; 1:92g, respectively, for ME, MP, and ML. The behavior of the estimator is evaluated over a several parameters, such as the sample size n\u00f0n \u2208 f20 ; 40 ; 60 ; 80 ; 100g\u00de, the percentage of censoring \u03c4 controlled by \u00f0\u03c3 ; \u03c32c \u00de. To compare the efficiency or the speed of convergence of the different models, we have fixed the percentage \u03c4 = 45% for all three models, and to compare the effect of censoring on the convergence and on the performance of the estimator, we have set two percentages \u03c4 = 15% and \u03c4 = 45%.\nIt is well known that, in the numerical study of nonparametric estimators, the kernel does not have enough influence on the quality or the convergence of the estimator. Thus, for our practical study, we have chosen the Gaussian kernel for the two kernels functions K and N . On the other hand, we know that the choice of the smoothing parameter has a very great influence on the performance of nonparametric estimators. Since our estimator depends on a single smoothing parameter hn, we do this: the smoothing parameter hn is selected using the empirical mean integrated squared error (MISE) approach on the compact \u00bdz\u00f01\u00de, z\u00f0n\u00de , where z\u00f01\u00de and z\u00f0n\u00de are the minimum and the maximum of the observations, respectively. Explicitly, the MISE is given by the formula:\nMISE hn\u00f0 \u00de = 1 n \u3020 n\nk=1 \u00f0z n\u00f0 \u00de z 1\u00f0 \u00de e k\u00f0 \u00den tjx\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 e tjx\u00f0 \u00de h i2 dt, \u00f066\u00de\nfor a given bandwidth h and for x fixed, and e\u00f0k\u00den \u00f0tjx\u00de with k = 1,\u22ef, n are the estimators en\u00f0tjx\u00de on the kth sample. Thus, a scan on the value of hn allows to determine the optimal value h\u0302n for the bandwidth hn which minimize the empirical MISE (66). Considering a sequence of tuning parameter \u03bd with 0:10 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 0:90 and generating several value of hn = n\u03bd, we determine the optimal value of the smoothing parameter hn by\nh\u0302n = arg min hn MISE hn\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f067\u00de\nWith MATLAB, we were able to determine the optimal\nparameter h (h\u0302 P n for MP, h\u0302 L n for ML, and h\u0302 E n for ME) and we calculated the residual mean squared error (RMSE) to compare the speed of convergence of the three models studied and also to compare the effect of censorship rates. The residual mean square error is given by\nRMSE = 1 n \u3020 n k=1 en ykjx\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 e ykjx\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de2, \u00f068\u00de\nwhere \u00f0yk\u00de1\u2264k\u2264n is a sequence of random observations from the chosen models. The numerical results obtained are grouped in Tables 1 and 2 as well as their corresponding graphical representations (Figures 2 and 3).\n4. Conclusion\nIn this article, we have shown that the elasticity function is monotonically decreasing and we have constructed a kernel estimator. The objective of this article is to show that the elasticity function is monotonic for distributions with support in \u211d+. Then, try to build a nonparametric estimator, to study its almost sure convergence or its strong consistency, and finally to make a numerical study in order to see the adequacy with the theory. Numerically, we notice that the ME model has a higher convergence speed than the others. In addition, we note that when the censorship rate is higher, its impact on convergence is very visible when the sample size is less than 100. Remember that the lack of a calculator led us not to test the sample sizes greater than 100 such as 150, 200, and 500 because with a size n = 100, the computation time with our machine is 44,743 seconds. It should also be noted that with the objectives being to find the direction of variation of the elasticity function and to construct an estimator, in our next article, we will study the asymptotic normality of this estimator to deduce a theoretical and numerical study on the central limit theorem (CLT).\nData Availability\nThe numerical data simulated using MATLAB and R software with three models (parabolic, exponential, or logarithm) used to support the conclusions of this study are not real data.
