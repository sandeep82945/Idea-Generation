            "text": "In the Fall 2020 semester, our transdisciplinary research team collected data on seropositivity of, and behaviors related to, SARS-CoV-2 among students, faculty, and staff at a large midwestern university (MU). Our team\u2019s mission was to understand the social and hard science of COVID19 in a college setting, in efforts to inform campus COVID-19 mitigation strategies. The MU Study of Seropositivity and Risk for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 went beyond the more-prominent COVID-19 related research among college students by incorporating highly accurate antibody testing to examine trends in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity on campus.1,2,3 The study also included an online survey focused on attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 and public health.\nThis paper outlines our study design and sample, then describes college students\u2019 results from the Fall semester emphasizing four key study variables: seropositive and self-reported Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-positive test rates; self-reported chances of about becoming infected with COVID-19; attitudes towards vaccination; and anxiety and depression.\nThe collaboration of the study\u2019s primary investigators from various departments including communication, health management and informatics, molecular microbiology and immunology, public health, sociology, and veterinary medicine, formed a natural group devoted to tackling the COVID-19 crisis and informing MU\u2019s Incident Command and human health experts on campus. These efforts resulted in campus public health safety adjustments throughout the Fall 2020 semester.\n2 Research Methodology and Analytic Sample\n2.1. Design\nThe full study, which ran from September through December 2020, included students, faculty, and staff affiliated with the university. The study was originally by invitation only; the MU administration periodically provided stratified, randomly drawn lists of student and employee email addresses for 950 undergraduates, 250 graduate/professional students, and 400 faculty/staff. The first three draws were sent email invitations every 10 days. Low response rates and the need to enroll a higher number of individuals for antibody testing in order to calculate disease prevalence led us to send two sets of 1,600 invitations, weekly, starting on October 12, 2020. In mid-October, we also received MU Institutional Review Board (protocol#2028427) permission to allow individuals to self-enroll into the study. We advertised selfenrollment via campus-wide email distribution lists, Facebook, and other social media, while continuing with the weekly targeted 3,200 email invitations. In the end, nearly 18% of participants came from selfenrollment, adding a crucial supplemental sample to this study.\nIn total, 28,217 faculty, staff, and students were randomly recruited (9.0% participation rate in at least study element\u2014antibody testing and/or online survey\u2014N=2,530) while 670 self-enrolled (with 83.4% then participating in at least study element). The total participation rate, in at least one study element\u2014antibody testing and/or the online survey\u2014was 10.7% (N=3,089). Out of these 3,089 participants, 1,446 students and 1,511 faculty/staff completed the survey (N=2,957; 95.7%). Of this group who completed the survey, 62.4% of students (N=902) and 77.4% of faculty/staff (N=1,170) also provided a blood sample for antibody testing.\nWhether invited or self-enrolled, individuals were sent information via email, and eligible persons were asked to complete the survey and blood\ndraw for antibody testing within two weeks of initial invitation or enrolling. All blood and survey data were collected and stored in REDCap. Those who wished to participate in the blood draw used an online platform created for the project to make an appointment at an oncampus student health facility. Study participants were eligible to participate in a raffle as compensation for their contribution to each study component.\nMU investigators and laboratory staff analyzed the 20mL blood samples using a Siemens Healthineers\u2019 testing system designed to identify SARSCoV-2 antibodies with high precision. This corporate partnership was essential because an internally developed antibody test was not available at MU.\n2.2. Reasoning\nAntibody testing enabled us to track changes in the percent of participants presenting with positive antibodies over the course of the Fall semester. The presence of antibodies is a \u201chistorical\u201d view of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they usually appear one to three weeks after infection and may not last more than a few months after infection.4,5,6 The antibody tests provided weekly snapshots that correlated with what the likely caseload was in previous weeks.\nThe survey collected general demographic and socio-economic data, as well as data on mental health, attitudes about COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and perceptions about how well individuals and the community were doing in combating COVID-19.7 In the interests of scientific transparency, we present descriptive statistics that include item nonresponse in the results section.\n2.3. MU Students in the Study\nAmong the 1,466 student participants, 62.9% were undergraduates, 30.3% were graduate students or in professional degrees, 0.9% were another type of student, and 5.9% did not provide this information. Of the student participants, 80.8% identified as White, 4.7% as Hispanic/Latino, 4.0% as African, Black or African American, and 9.9% as another racial/ethnic identity, while 0.6% did not respond. Also, 69.2% of participants identified as female, 28.6% as male, and 1.8% as outside of the gender binary."

            "text": "3.1. Self-reported COVID-19 Testing and Positivity Rate\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for key variables from the study. As shown in the second column, nearly half (49.2%) of students had received at least one PCR test since the onset of the pandemic and prior to taking the survey. Of the 708 students who reported having had a PCR test, 22% had at least one positive test (n=159), which represented 11% of all student survey respondents.\n3.2 SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Testing and Positivity Rate\nOnly 62% of students participated in the blood draw for antibody testing (N=902). Of those who donated their blood, 15.1% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (authors\u2019 calculations). This positivity rate is higher than the positive PCR self-report rate of 11% among the students in the study. Note, however, that these samples are not directly comparable.\n(missing) 74 5.1 69 5.1 5 5.6\n3.3 Perception Chance of COVID-19 Infection\nStudents were asked what the chances (0-100%) were they and someone\nthey personally know had been infected with COVID-19. Over twelve\npercent of students said there was a 75% chance or greater they had been\ninfected\u2014a figure close to the 11.0% self-report positivity rate found for\nthe student participants. This contrasts with the 78.1% of students who\nsaid there was a 75% chance or greater they knew someone personally\nwho had been infected. In other words, while a relatively low share of\nstudents reported a high likelihood of COVID-19 infection, a relatively\nhigh share indicated a high likelihood they knew someone with COVID-19\ninfection. This discrepancy between self-report of COVID-19 infection\nchances and perceptions of risk for others is due in part to the high share\nof students who did not answer the question on personal chances of\nCOVID-19 infection. Indeed, the majority of students (57%) were\nunwilling to \u201cguess\u201d if they had been infected with COVID-19. We are\nunable to discern why this is the case. We suspect it is related to student\nconcerns about how the information would be used to restrict student\nparticipation in classes and campus life.\n3.4. Vaccination Intentions\nStudents show a high level of vaccine intent. More than three quarters of students (77.4%) agreed or strongly agreed they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if it became available. Considering that herd immunity would require somewhere between 70% to 80% of the US population to become vaccinated, it is possible the campus will reach herd immunity if students\nfollow through on their vaccine intentions.8,9 Yet, nearly 1 in 5 students do not plan to get the vaccine or were unsure at the time of the survey. Further, despite continuous public discourse about the benefits of vaccines throughout the pandemic, only 58.8% of students indicated that they had their flu shot in 2019 and had already received or planned to get their shot in 2020. This rate is remarkably low and does not bode well for future campus infectious disease mitigation strategies for Fall 2021 and beyond.\n3.5 Mental Health Outcomes\nLastly, our externally validated mental health indicators of General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and clinical Depression (PHQ-9) offer a baseline look of the state of student mental health in Fall 2020.9,10,11,12,13 Based on the scoring systems of the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, 34.8% of students were classified as having moderate to severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, while 13.1% were classified as having moderate to severe Depression. While we cannot discern whether these rates are different from pre-pandemic rates, it is useful for comparisons across other universities and within MU over time. Additionally, these rates highlight a need for expanded mental health resources on campus.\n3.6 How Did Self-Enrolled Students Differ from Randomly Selected Students?\nThe 89 students who self-enrolled into the study, without invitation, were different in important ways from those who were contacted via random selection and then chose to enroll in the study. Chi-square tests revealed that the self-enrolled were more likely to have had a previous COVID-19 PCR test, test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, be older, and be graduate students."

            "heading": "4 Conclusion",
            "text": "The results of our study indicate that between 11% to 15% of students had been infected with COVID-19. Further, students were less likely to report they had a chance of having COVID-19 than of knowing someone who had contracted COVID-19. The vaccine intention rate suggests herd immunity may be possible, although low rates of flu vaccine take-up suggest converting intention to actual vaccination take-up may prove challenging. Finally, student mental health concerns, especially anxiety and depression, are noted.\nOur study raises several issues. We are concerned about student distrust of how the university will use their COVID health information. For instance, more than half of students were unwilling to suggest their chances of having been infected with COVID-19. In Fall 2020, students were quarantined when they reported positive test results from whatever source of testing (e.g., campus testing service, county health department). Members of the campus community suspected students did not want to be quarantined, and therefore may not have been tested even when they thought they were exposed to the virus. Students may have been unwilling to note a high chance of a being infected out of fear that the study personnel would report the information to those on campus involved with the quarantine process.\nAlthough a high share of students indicated an intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine when available, in the months since this study there has been an onslaught of misinformation about the vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy among students may have increased. The university will need to institute public health communication strategies that encourage vaccination, possibly using advertising that reminds students that the majority of them intended to get the vaccine.\nFinally, we note that men are underrepresented in our study. Given the national evidence that men are less likely to support COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and that subsets of men are most vaccine hesitant, our estimates of COVID-19 positivity rates and vaccine intentions may not be as accurate for male students, a subject of future research.14 Further, public health research on college students likely needs specific marketing strategies to increase participation among male students.\nKeeping the student body and surrounding community safe, healthy, and informed, to the greatest extent possible, should always be a high institutional priority. This study was one strategy used by our university to address health concerns of our community. The relatively low positivity rate and high vaccine intention rate suggest, still, that public health communications on the campus were effective."
