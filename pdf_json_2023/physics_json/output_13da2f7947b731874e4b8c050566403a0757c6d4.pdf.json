            "text": "Recently, anion-shuttle batteries (ASBs) with anions as charge carriers, including halogen anions (F\u2212, Cl\u2212 and Br\u2212) and complex anions (PF6 \u2212, TFSI\u2212, AlCl4 \u2212, ClO4 \u2212, NO3 \u2212 and [ZnCl4]2 \u2212), have played an important role in developing new rechargeable battery chemistries, because of their large theoretical energy density, environmental friendliness and cost competitiveness.1\u20134 Specically, chloride-ion batteries (CIBs) possess the advantages of a theoretical volumetric energy density of 2500 W h L\u22121 and the worldwide availability of chloride-containing precursor materials, which all facilitate the CIB as a representative electrochemical system for sustainable grid-scale energy storage.5\u20139 Up to now, several studies have been devoted to exploring new cathode materials for Cl\u2212 storage. For instance, conversion-type metal chlorides (CoCl2 or\nHigh Efficient Energy Storage Technology Physics, China University of Mining and\nhina.

But the large volumetric change during chlorination/de-chlorination triggers severe pulverization and collapse of these materials which lead to the serious irreversibility of such CIBs.14 Aerwards, intercalation-type layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were reported as promising cathodes for CIBs due to their unique topological characteristics and high redox activity.15\u201317 However, the intrinsic poor conductivity and limited surface area of LDH powder materials induce severe decay of initial capacity and sluggish Cl\u2212 diffusion problems for LDH-based CIBs.18 Thus, the intense exploration of desirable cathodes with superior kinetics and capacity retention stability for reversible Cl\u2212 storage holds great signicance for the development of CIBs.\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of metal nodes (ions or clusters) and organic linkers, have attracted tremendous attention in energy storage and conversion.19,20 Compared with conventional inorganic materials, the intrinsic well-dened crystalline frameworks of MOFs ensure their outstanding structural stability and uniformly distributed electroactive sites.21\u201323 Moreover, MOFs with permanent porosity and a prominent specic surface area also exhibit rapid electrolyte penetration and enhanced ion diffusion transport.

Nevertheless, the feasibility of MOF-based electrodes in ASBs has not been reported yet. Considering the above discussion, selection of compatible organic ligands, designing MOFs with advantageous frameworks to accommodate anions, and investigating the anionic energy storage mechanism of MOFmaterials offer great promise for the crucial development of ASBs.\nHere, a novel nickel-based MOF ([Ni(dpip)]), which has an open porous framework with electrochemically active metal centers in four directions, was studied as a cathode for CIBs. The Ni(dpip) cathode shows a remarkable Cl\u2212 storage performance: a stable reversible capacity of z155 mA h g\u22121 over 500 cycles with an extremely low capacity decay of 0.026% per cycle at a current density of 150 mA g\u22121. This is the rst example of a new cathode for high performance ASBs made entirely from neat MOFs as active materials. Ni(dpip) possesses uniform mesopores and double one-dimensional (1D) tubular channels with different opening sizes, which provide high exposure of active sites and are benecial for feasible Cl\u2212 diffusion simultaneously. Furthermore, the reversible chemical state changes in Ni2+/Ni3+ and N0/N1+ couples during the charge/discharge process conrmed the energy storage mechanism of the synergetic contributions from both metal ions and organic ligands for the MOF-based CIBs. This study opens up an avenue for application of MOF electrode materials and discovers a new family of attractive cathodes for anion-type rechargeable batteries."

            "text": "The chemical formula of Ni-MOF can be described as [Ni(dpip)], which is conrmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).33 The Ni-MOF crystallizes in a tetragonal I 4c2 space group, consisting of double tubular channels with different open sizes (9.5 \u00c5 and 6.6 \u00c5) and surface groups, including pyridine rings and carboxy O atoms, which\n5644 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 5643\u20135649\nprovides a favourable environment for Cl\u2212 storage and transmission (Fig. 1a). TGA analysis revealed a high thermostable temperature of 400 \u00b0C (Fig. S1\u2020). The PXRD pattern of the synthesized samples is in good agreement with that simulated from the corresponding crystal structure, proving the good phase purity of Ni-MOF (Fig. 1b).\nThe N2 adsorption test at 77 K conrms the permanent porosity of the activated Ni-MOF. As shown in Fig. 1c, the saturated N2 uptake is 376 cm\n3 g\u22121, and the tted BET surface area and pore volume are 1011.7 m2 g\u22121 and 0.54 cm3 g\u22121, respectively. The morphology and microstructure of the [Ni(dpip)] sample were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both images indicate that the Ni-MOF possesses the regular blockyshape morphology and elemental mapping further shows that C, N, O, and Ni elements are homogeneously distributed in the sample (Fig. 1d and 2a, see the digital photograph in Fig. S2\u2020). Subsequently, the surface chemical valence state of Ni-MOF was further determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum (Fig. S3\u2020) shows the existence of C, N, O, and Ni elements in the MOF. Fig. 2b (le) presents the highresolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p and the binding energies at 855.8 and 873.4 eV are identied for Ni2+.34 For N 1s spectra shown in Fig. 2b (middle), the tting peak at 399.3 was reported for pyridinic-N species in the dpip ligand.35 In addition, the O1s spectra of Ni-MOF are composed of peaks at binding energies 531.3 eV (O1), 530.8 eV (O2) and 532.4 (O3), showing the presence of metal\u2013oxygen (M\u2013O) bonds, O\u2013H bonds of H2O in NiMOF and O\u2013O bonds from adsorbed molecular oxygen, respectively.\nAer an activation process by chlorination (pre-charge), the typical sloping prole of the Ni(dpip) cathode with an initial high discharge capacity of 178.1 (83.5% of the theoretical discharge capacity based on the asymmetric unit molar formula) mA h g\u22121 was obtained as shown in Fig. 3a and S4.\u2020 Meanwhile, the curves of NiSO4 and the pure 4,6-di(pyridin-4-yl) isophthalic acid ligand both display a similar shape to Ni(dpip) but a rather low capacity of 16.8 mA h g\u22121 and 52.9 mA h g\u22121.

When the current densities were set back to lower densities gradually, the capacities also returned to 102.1, 136.3 and 161.2 mA h g\u22121 respectively, indicating the robust reversible redox behavior. The desirable rate performance can be ascribed to the open porous frameworks and organic structural exibility of Ni-MOF which will be discussed in the following mechanism section.\nThe electrochemical dynamics of Cl\u2212 storage for Ni(dpip) was explored using CV measurements at different scan rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mV s\u22121 (Fig. 3c). Generally, the relationship between peak current (i) and the scan rate (v) obeys a power-law as follows:\ni = avb\nwhere a b value of 1.0 refers to a surface capacitive-controlled behavior while a b value of 0.5 indicates a semi-innite linear diffusion dominated charge storage process.36 The calculated bvalues of the Ni(dpip) cathode are 0.53, 0.76 and 0.66 (Fig. 3d and e), which are determined using the slopes of the log(v) versus log(i) plot from three redox peaks (peak 1, peak 2 and peak 3). The results reveal that diffusion and surface controlled energy storage mechanisms coexist for the Li\u2016Ni(dpip) CIB. The contribution fractions from diffusion-control and capacitivecontrol are quantitatively evaluated using the values of k1 and k2 in the following equation:37\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ni = k1v + k2v 1/2\nAs shown in Fig. 3f, the surface controlled contributions for the Cl\u2212 storage are 41%, 48%, 53%, 57% and 61% at corresponding scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8 mV s\u22121 (Fig. S5\u2020).\nWhen operated at a current density of 150 mA g\u22121, the Ni(dpip) cathode is capable of delivering a stabilized capacity of z155 mA h g\u22121 aer 500 cycles with a steady coulombic efficiency of z100% as shown in Fig. 3g, demonstrating outstanding long-term cycling performance. Furthermore, the selected charge and discharge curves of the Li/BPy14Cl-PC/ Ni(dpip) CIB indicate the superior voltage stability during the cycling (Fig. S6\u2020). Since it is unavoidable that the discharge product of LiCl on the surface of the lithium anodemay dissolve in the CIB during long cycling, even given its low solubility in PC solvent, the interference arising from Li-accommodate in the Ni(dpip) cathode cannot be ignored. As shown in Fig. S7,\u2020 even when using the LiPF6-EC-DMC-PC electrolyte, Ni(dpip) could only deliver just 33 mA h g\u22121 discharge capacity with the same operating parameters of CIBs. Additionally, based on the lithium ion transport, the charge/discharge proles of the Li/ LiPF6-EC-DMC-PC/Ni(dpip) cell shown in Fig. S8\u2020 are completely different from those of the Li/BPy14Cl-PC/Ni(dpip) CIB and display an obvious discharge plateau at 1.8 V and charge plateau at around 2.2 V. In order to conrm the advantages of the unique double 1D diffusion channel structure of Ni(dpip), electrochemical performances of NiSO4 and the pure 4,6-di(pyridin-4-yl) isophthalic acid ligand were also investigated in CIB systems at a current density of 150 mA g\u22121. The result shows that metal\u2013salt NiSO4 presented almost no capacity for Cl\u2212 storage (Fig. S9\u2020). However, the 4,6-di(pyridin-4yl) isophthalic acid ligand displayed a relatively better discharge capacity of 56 mA h g\u22121 (Fig. S10\u2020), which was probably due to the hetero-atoms in the pyridine group.\nMost signicantly, the Ni(dpip) cathode exhibits a negligible capacity decay of 0.026% per cycle, which is the best level among those of all previously reported cathodes for CIBs. Additionally, the Ni(dpip) cathode could also maintain a reversible discharge capacity of 121.6 mA h g\u22121 at a higher current density of 300 mA g\u22121, with a good capacity decay of 0.17% per cycle over 200 charge/discharge reactions (Fig. 3h). It should be admitted that the discharge platform of CIBs is not as good as that of some cation-based batteries at present. However, such CIBs still remain attractive, because chloride materials are more widely available for sustainable utilization or low cost and another extraordinary characteristic is that they are metal dendrite-free, which makes CIB systems more secure for practical application (Fig. S11\u2020). From the comparison study shown in Fig. 3i and Table S1\u2020,10,11,15,38\u201343 the Ni-MOF material shows great potential in terms of the satisfactory capacity and excellent reversibility of CIBs.\nThe ex situ XRD patterns of the Ni(dpip) cathode at various electrochemical states are shown in Fig. S12.\u2020 It is worth noting that during the whole cycling process, no new diffraction peak is observed for the cathode, except that the crystallinity of Ni(dpip) becomes weakened at high voltage, which probably\nChem.

The ex situ XPS technique was performed to probe the Cl-storage mechanism during the charge/discharge process in the Ni(dpip)-based CIB. The enlarged views of Ni 2p3/2 core regions at different voltage stages are shown in Fig. 4a and b, displaying the reversible evolution between Ni2+ and Ni3+. During the charge reaction, the peak intensity at a binding energy of 856.8 eV, which is identied for Ni3+, increases from the initial 1.2 V electrode sample. When the Ni(dpip) cathode charges to 2.5 V, the integration of peak areas for Ni3+/Ni2+ changes from 0 to 2.55 (Fig. 4e), as a result of Cl\u2212 intercalation. At the end of charging (the sample at 3.0 V), the characteristic peak of Ni2+ at 855.6 eV disappears completely, indicating that all the Ni2+ in the original Ni-MOF are oxidized to Ni3+. Upon the following discharge, the intensity of the Ni2+ peak gradually recovers and the ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+ peak integrals decreases from 2.08 at 2.3 V to 0.37 at 1.4 V. When the discharge process is completely nished, the oxidized coordination center of Ni3+(dpip) almost returned to its initial state of Ni2+ before cycling, implying the highly reversibility of the Ni2+/Ni3+ couple in the Ni(dpip) cathode. The oxidation state variations of Ni2+/Ni3+ during cycling were further conrmed through ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, in which the threshold energy position of K-edge XANES spectra of transition metals is very sensitive to their valence states. As depicted in Fig. S13,\u2020 the K-edge XANES spectra for the Ni node exhibit a typically rigid edge shi towards higher energy continuously with the increase of voltage states, verifying the oxidation of Ni2+\nFig. 4 Ex situ XPS spectra of the Ni 2p3/2 region at various voltage states i region at various voltage states in (c) charge and (d) discharge processes and (f) N0 1s/N+ 1s; (g) XPS spectra of the Cl 2p region at various voltage CIB system.\n5646 | Chem.

N 1s XPS spectra of the Ni(dpip) electrode at different states in Cl-insertion (1.2, 1.8, 2.2, 2.5 and 3.0 V) and Cl-deinsertion (3.0, 2.3, 1.7, 1.4 and 1.2 V) processes are presented in Fig. 4c and d. All the observed peaks of highresolution N 1s can be deconvoluted into two characteristic peaks at binding energies of 399.15 and 402.09 eV, which are assigned to neutral N0 (blue area) and oxidized N+ (orange area) respectively.44 As presented in Fig. 4c, the N+ signal increases at the expense of the N0 signal, and the N+/N0 ratio also increases from 0.99 to 7.31 as shown in Fig. 4f, demonstrating that the increasing Cl\u2212 insertion extent results in the signicant oxidation of N atoms with an increase in voltage. When discharged to 2.3 V, the N+/N0 ratio decreases dramatically to 2.05, from which it could be concluded that the transformation between N+ and N0 tends to occur at higher potential. Upon discharging, an obvious recovery is also observed for the intensity of N0 and the ratio of the N+/N0 peak integrals (N+/N0 = 1.09) at 1.2 V almost fully returns to its initial value before cycling, which attributes to reduction of the N element in the Ni(dpip) cathode for charge balance accompanied by the de-insertion of Cl\u2212. To display directly the reversible migration of chloride ions between the two electrodes, XPS spectra of the Cl 2p region at different voltage states are shown in Fig. 4g.

For the Li anode, the XRD pattern (Fig. S14\u2020) displays the diffractions ascribed to the LiCl phase aer being fully discharged, indicating that the chloride ions transferred to the Li anode to form LiCl on the surface. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. S15,\u2020 no extra peak was observed in the XRD patterns of the Ni(dpip) cathode aer the 200th cycle, suggesting no signicant phase evolution during the electrochemical process.\nTo further verify the pivotal role of the two different 1D tubular channels in the Ni(dpip) electrode in terms of excellent chloride storage performance, the Cl\u2212 ion diffusion in Ni(dpip) was simulated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI\u2212NEB) method. One of the diffusion pathways of Cl\u2212 in the Ni(dpip) side channel is shown in Fig. 5a, which shows that a large opening size of 9.5 \u00c5 provides adequate space for Cl\u2212 iona to migrate. The chloride migration energy barrier in such large scale molecules is just 0.67 eV (Fig. 5b). Besides the conventionally capacious channel ionic diffusion behavior, Cl\u2212 ionic diffusion in the central channel of Ni(dpip) with an opening size of 6.6 \u00c5 was also considered (Fig. 5c). As depicted in Fig. 5d, the migration energy barrier of this channel for Cl\u2212 diffusion is estimated to be z0.9 eV, which is a little higher than that of side channel migration but still feasible for Cl\u2212 diffusion. Considering that the side channel is formed by the ligand pyridine ring connected with Ni nodes compared to the central one, density functional theory (DFT) calculations also well supported that the lower migration energy barrier of the side channel is benecial for the charge exchange behavior between ligand-N and Cl\u2212.\nFig. 5 (a) Calculated diffusion pathways of Cl\u2212 in the Ni(dpip) side tubular channel and (b) the correspondingmigration energy barrier; (c) calculated diffusion pathways of Cl\u2212 in the Ni(dpip) central tubular channel and (d) the corresponding migration energy barrier.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFor better illustrating the unique structural advantages of Ni(dpip), the electrochemical performances of three different MOF materials were evaluated in CIB systems subsequently. First, HKUST-1 is a classical 3D framework formed by the connection of paddle wheel type [Cu2(OOC)4] SBUs and btc ligands, as shown in Fig. S16a,\u2020 which possesses an accessible porosity of 50% with a pore size of 1 nm. Despite the high porosity and large aperture, the HKUST-1 cathode displays negligible Cl-storage capacity (Fig. S16b\u2020) due to the Cu nodes and carboxylic acid-type ligand without N hetero-atoms. For the next reference sample shown in Fig. S17a,\u2020 the adjacent Ni(II) ions in [Ni3(btc)2(bipy)3(H2O)2] are connected by btc to form a coplanar layer, and the layers are supported by bipy to form a 3D framework with a narrow oblong channel of ca. 2.0 \u00d7 7.9 \u00c52. As depicted in Fig. S17b,\u2020 the [Ni3(btc)2(bipy)3(H2O)2] cathode shows a maximum discharge capacity of 53.4 mA h g\u22121 but a poor capacity retention of 41.9% aer 100 cycles. In contrast, [Ni-(4Pyc)2$DMF] (Fig. S18a\u2020), which has square channels with an effective size of about 7.0 \u00d7 7.0 \u00c52 along the aaxis by connecting isolated Ni(II) ions with 4-pyridyl carboxylic acid ligands, shows a reasonable improved maximum discharge capacity of 107.9 mA h g\u22121 with a moderate capacity retention of 67.4% (Fig. S18b\u2020).\nThe galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was applied as an efficient method to calculate chemical diffusion coefficients. (The time versus the voltage curve for a single titration is shown in the ESI, Fig. S19\u2020.) As shown in Fig. 6a, the average Cl\u2212 diffusion coefficients of Ni(dpip) are between 10\u221211 and 10\u22129 cm2 s\u22121 during the charge/discharge process, which demonstrates the robust Cl\u2212 diffusion kinetics. Additionally, the morphology variation of the Ni(dpip) electrode aer discharge and recharge is given in Fig. 6b and c. Compared to pristine bulk Ni(dpip), the cycled-Ni(dpip) cathode displays the morphology of splitted stacked layers owing to the reversible insertion/deinsertion of a large amount of chloride ions.\nChem.

            "text": "In summary, we demonstrate that Ni(dpip) is promising as a new family of cathode materials in CIB systems. The Ni(dpip) electrode exhibited a reversible capacity retained to be 155 mA h g\u22121 aer 500 cycles at 150 mA g\u22121 with an extraordinary low capacity decay of 0.026% per cycle and high rate capability with a discharge capacity of 121.6 mA h g\u22121 at 300 mA g\u22121 which is better than those of previously reported CIBs using organic electrolyte. DFT simulations reveal that such superior Cl\u2212 storage behavior with a much higher chloride ion diffusion coefficient is attributed to the open porous frameworks of double 1D tubular channels with various effective opening sizes to facilitate the diffusion and transportation of both charge carriers and electrolytes. The synergetic redox activity of N0/N+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ in the repeating coordination units participated in the electrochemical cycling which endows Ni(dpip) with high Cl\u2212 ion storage capacity. This work thus establishes MOF materials with tubular channels and high porosity as attractive cathodes for anion-type rechargeable batteries."
