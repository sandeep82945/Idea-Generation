    "abstractText": "Background: Sri Lanka is faced with the challenge of managing a large population with diabetes mellitus by 2030. Psychological stress plays a major role in disease outcome by exerting physiological, psychological and social effects on individuals with chronic disorders. Meditation-based interventions have positive effects on the management of stress and diabetes, which are mediated via modulation of neuro-humoral mechanisms and autonomic functions, among others. Mechanisms of bio-physiological effects of meditation are considered to be through reduction of stress hormones, improvement of insulin resistance and improvement of autonomic dysfunction. Methods: This study will be conducted as an open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial in the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo. The aim is to investigate the effects of meditation on glycaemic control and possible mechanisms of how meditation affects glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo (ERC/2019/094). Patients who are attending the professorial unit medical clinic with type 2 diabetes (172 in total) will be recruited based on inclusionexclusion criteria. Patients who have never meditated or rarely meditated (less than once every three months) will be randomized using block randomization to meditation and waitlisted arms (1:1 allocation ratio). The meditation arm will undergo a mindfulness meditation program (selected after studying several meditation methods) conducted by a qualified instructor weekly for a period of 12 weeks in addition to usual care, while the waitlisted arm will only receive usual care. Daily meditation practices will be recorded in a diary. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c. Secondary outcome measures are fasting blood sugar, fructosamine, insulin resistance (calculated using fasting serum insulin), 24-h urinary cortisol, body mass index, cardiac autonomic reflex testing (Ewing\u2019s battery of tests) and orocecal transit time using hydrogen breath analysis. All these will be done prior to commencement of the intervention and after 3 months in both arms. Data will be analysed using SPSS V-23. Discussion: This study aims to identify the effect of mindfulness meditation on glycaemic control and the possible mechanisms (neuro humoral and autonomic functions) by which beneficial effects are mediated.

In both health and disease, psychological stress plays a major role in determining the well-being of an individual. It affects the individual\u2019s behaviour pattern, biophysical parameters and how the individual copes with disease [3]. It has been postulated that physiological processes are affected by stress through the neuro-endocrine response system. Stress stimulates both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the sympatheticadrenal-medullary system, which in turn affects a wide range of physiological processes [3]. Chronic stress leads to elevated cortisol levels and results in poor glycaemic control [4] It also indirectly affects glycaemic control through changes in behaviour patterns such as diet and exercise [5]. It has been recognized that stress has a negative effect on quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing [3] in patients with diabetes. Meditation can be defined as the intentional self-regulation of attention from moment to moment [6]. The roots of most meditation practices have evolved from Buddhism. There are two major areas in meditation: concentration meditation and insightful meditation. Concentration meditation is known as \u201cSamatha\u201d in Theravada Buddhism and involves focussing attention to one thing [6]. Insightful or awareness meditation, which is known as \u201cvipassana\u201d in Theravada Buddhism, does not restrict attention to one thing but emphasizes detached selfobservation from one moment to another [6]. However, these two areas are not mutually exclusive and can be described as two aspects of the same meditative state [7]. It has also been viewed as \u201cSamatha\u201d meditation practices leading to stability of the mind, whereas \u201cVipassana\u201d meditation practices leading to clarity of the mind [7]. Furthermore, a state of stability of the mind is needed to achieve clarity of mind. It is important to understand that Buddhist meditation is not merely a method of relaxation but is aimed at achieving a balance between stability and clarity of mind through practice [7]. The meditative state thus reached is said to be present not only during meditation but also after meditation. The modern term of mindfulness or \u201cSati\u201d in Buddhist literature, is described as a state of mind achieved through focussing the attention on one thing and being in the present moment.

Mechanisms of bio-physiological effects of meditation are considered to be through reduction of stress hormones, improvement of insulin resistance and improvement of autonomic dysfunction.\nMethods: This study will be conducted as an open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial in the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo. The aim is to investigate the effects of meditation on glycaemic control and possible mechanisms of how meditation affects glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo (ERC/2019/094). Patients who are attending the professorial unit medical clinic with type 2 diabetes (172 in total) will be recruited based on inclusionexclusion criteria. Patients who have never meditated or rarely meditated (less than once every three months) will be randomized using block randomization to meditation and waitlisted arms (1:1 allocation ratio). The meditation arm will undergo a mindfulness meditation program (selected after studying several meditation methods) conducted by a qualified instructor weekly for a period of 12 weeks in addition to usual care, while the waitlisted arm will only receive usual care. Daily meditation practices will be recorded in a diary. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c. Secondary outcome measures are fasting blood sugar, fructosamine, insulin resistance (calculated using fasting serum insulin), 24-h urinary cortisol, body mass index, cardiac autonomic reflex testing (Ewing\u2019s battery of tests) and orocecal transit time using hydrogen breath analysis. All these will be done prior to commencement of the intervention and after 3 months in both arms. Data will be analysed using SPSS V-23.\nDiscussion: This study aims to identify the effect of mindfulness meditation on glycaemic control and the possible mechanisms (neuro humoral and autonomic functions) by which beneficial effects are mediated.\nTrial registration: Registered under Sri Lanka Clinical Trial Registry: SLCTR/2021/015\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rising worldwide, especially in the Southeast Asian region [1] and in Sri Lanka it has been projected to rise up to 13.9% by 2030 [2].\nIn both health and disease, psychological stress plays a major role in determining the well-being of an individual. It affects the individual\u2019s behaviour pattern, biophysical parameters and how the individual copes with disease [3]. It has been postulated that physiological processes are affected by stress through the neuro-endocrine response system. Stress stimulates both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the sympatheticadrenal-medullary system, which in turn affects a wide range of physiological processes [3]. Chronic stress leads to elevated cortisol levels and results in poor glycaemic control [4] It also indirectly affects glycaemic control through changes in behaviour patterns such as diet and exercise [5]. It has been recognized that stress has a negative effect on quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing [3] in patients with diabetes.\nMeditation can be defined as the intentional self-regulation of attention from moment to moment [6]. The roots of most meditation practices have evolved from Buddhism. There are two major areas in meditation: concentration meditation and insightful meditation. Concentration meditation is known as \u201cSamatha\u201d in Theravada Buddhism and involves focussing attention to one thing [6]. Insightful or awareness meditation, which is known as \u201cvipassana\u201d in Theravada Buddhism, does not restrict attention to one thing but emphasizes detached selfobservation from one moment to another [6]. However, these two areas are not mutually exclusive and can be described as two aspects of the same meditative state [7]. It has also been viewed as \u201cSamatha\u201d meditation practices leading to stability of the mind, whereas \u201cVipassana\u201d meditation practices leading to clarity of the mind [7]. Furthermore, a state of stability of the mind is needed to achieve clarity of mind. It is important to understand that Buddhist meditation is not merely a method of relaxation but is aimed at achieving a balance between stability and clarity of mind through practice [7]. The meditative state thus reached is said to be present not only during meditation but also after meditation. The modern term of mindfulness or \u201cSati\u201d in Buddhist literature, is described as a state of mind achieved through focussing the attention on one thing and being in the present moment.\nThe Universal Trial Number (UTN) U1111-1266-8640\nKeywords: Mindfulness meditation, Diabetes mellitus, Mechanisms of metabolic control\nThis paves the pathway to achieve a higher state of mind through meditation. The aim is to have focused attention as well as to identify when the attention is deviated and regained [7]. One example is \u201cAnapanasathi\u201d meditation which has been described as keeping the focused attention on breathing and being at the present moment (breath awareness).\nIn clinical psychology, meditation is defined as \u201cA family of self-regulation practices that focus on training attention and awareness in order to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control and thereby foster general mental well-being and development and/or specific capacities such as calm, clarity, and concentration\u201d [8]. Thus, the core components of meditation practices include focused attention, self-regulation and self-awareness [8].\nThere is evidence to suggest that meditation-based interventions have positive effects on the management of stress and diabetes [3, 4, 9, 10]. The beneficial effect of meditation on the management of diabetes includes; (a) modulation of neuro-humoral mechanisms that are involved in the management of stress, (b) improvement of overall coping ability with a chronic illness and (c) favourable impact on behaviours such as compliance with diet control, exercise regimen and medications. The development of present moment awareness promotes non-judgmental acceptance of the present status and encourages individuals not to indulge in ruminative thoughts on previous or anticipated events [3]. This aspect of meditation helps the individual to come to terms with chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Therefore, mindfulness meditation practices can be viewed as techniques that sharpen the awareness and bring peace and tranquility. These can also be viewed as mindfulnessbased intervention or mind-body therapy.\nIt has been revealed that walking meditation, a form of concentration meditation, produces multiple favourable effects, such as a reduction in cortisol levels, better glycaemic control and reduced arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes [4]. Rosenzweig et\u00a0 al. [9] analysed the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy (MBST) on measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, body weight, and psychological symptoms in patients with diabetes. This pilot study found a reduction in HbA1c of 0.5%, reduction in mean arterial pressure of 6 mmHg, and reduction in depression and anxiety scores.\nResearchers have identified the regions of the brain involved during various aspects of meditation [11]. For example, the anterior cingulate cortex and striatum in attention control, multiple prefrontal regions, limbic regions and striatum in emotion regulation and insula, medial prefrontal cortex posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus in self-awareness [11]. The metabolic effects of\nmeditation are through neuro-humoral modulation and stress reduction. Even short-term meditation has been shown to increase the activity of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in stress regulation. Meditation suppresses the activity of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, which are involved in flight or fight reaction [11] thus reducing stress hormone levels.\nIn a study that assessed neural activity associated with \u201cAnapanasathi\u201d meditation and love and kindness meditation (Metta), it was noted that after 30 min of meditation, significant changes in functional MRI signals were observed in the right middle frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobe, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and left middle occipital gyrus both in novices and experienced meditators [12]. These findings are similar to the other studies performed in long-term meditators [11]. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the relaxation response thus brought about through meditation leads to beneficial effects such as improvement of glycaemic control through mechanisms such as reduction of stress hormone levels.\nFurthermore, it has been found that mind body therapies such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, and meditation may supplement the conventional care and management of metabolic syndrome [13].\nMeditation exerts changes in autonomic functions as well. In an Indian study, it was shown that parasympathetic tone was significantly higher in the meditators than in the control group [14]. As autonomic neuronal dysfunction is related to diabetes control and many complications of diabetes (gastrointestinal dysfunction and cardiac autonomic dysfunction), it will be useful to investigate the changes in autonomic functions, in patients with diabetes when meditation is practised.\nIntestinal dysmotility due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy [15] and diabetic enteric neuropathy has been implicated as the main reason for gastrointestinal complications such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [16], gastro-paresis, slow-transit constipation and diabetic diarrhoea. These complications lead to poor glycaemic control owing to erratic absorption of glucose [15]. Stress has been shown to increase gastric emptying time, increase distal colonic motility and accelerate small intestinal transit [17]. It is possible to hypothesize that psychological stress-induced changes in intestinal motility have a negative impact on glycaemic control due to erratic glucose absorption even in the absence of diabetes-related autonomic neuropathy and enteric neuropathy.\nThe effects of cardiac autonomic neuropathy, such as reduced heart rate variability during deep breathing, decreased baroreflex sensitivity, and orthostatic hypotension [18], can be assessed noninvasively, by 5 simple\ntests (Ewing et\u00a0 al.) [19]; cardiac autonomic reflex testing (CART) [19]. However, the heart rate response to deep breathing is the test that is most frequently utilized because of its high reproducibility and specificity [20].\nThere is evidence from a small study involving healthy adults that meditation causes an increase in heart rate variability and causes a decrease in the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (more predominant vagal tone), which indicates improved autonomic function [21]. Furthermore, it has\u00a0 been shown that,\u00a0 in diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy, stress decreases high-frequency heart rate variations [22]. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the stress-relieving effect of meditation will have an effect on reduction of low-frequency to high-frequency heart rate variations, indicating better autonomic function. Improvement of cardiac autonomic testing can be taken as a marker of improvement of overall autonomic functions, which might have beneficial effects on the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system, thus improving the glycaemic control.\nThus, it can be hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying the bio-physiological effects of meditation would be through reduction of stress hormones (cortisol), improvement of insulin resistance and improvement of autonomic dysfunction [3].\nTherefore, we report the original protocol of the study aiming to identify the impact of meditation on glycaemic control and the possible mechanisms, such as modulation of the autonomic nervous system, reduction of cortisol levels, improvement in gut transit time and improvement in insulin resistance.\nTo date, there had not been any clinical trial conducted in Sri Lanka studying the effects of meditation in patients with diabetes. The acceptability of meditation is likely to be high in Sri Lanka, with a population of over 70% Buddhists (Department of Senses and Statistics 2012). With the growing population of diabetes in Sri Lanka, exploration of the effects of mind-body therapies such as meditation is timely, as it is cost-effective, non-invasive and has minimal negative effects. If proven effective, in the future, meditation can be successfully incorporated into the comprehensive management of patients with diabetes to improve physical-psychological and social health in the Sri Lankan setup with minimal resources."

If such instances occur, investigators are dedicated to support their decision to leave the study if desired and to maintain confidentiality at all times."

The number of patients required was 86 in each arm, which was calculated on the basis of determining a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c in the meditation arm in comparison to the waitlisted arm. The basis of 0.5% reduction is derived from looking at several randomized controlled trials\u00a0 (RCT) which have shown a significant reduction of HbA1c in the meditation arm compared to control arm. The reduction of HbA1c were; 0.5% in Gainey et\u00a0 al. 2016 [4], 0.7% in Gregg et\u00a0 al. 2007 [25], 0.74% in Pearson et\u00a0al. 2018 [26], 0.83% in Miller et\u00a0al 2012 [27], 1.0% in Armani Kian et\u00a0al. 2018 [28], 1.1% in Chen et\u00a0al. 2020 [29]. According to a meta-analysis, most of the oral hypoglycaemic drugs lowered HbA1c by 0.5% [30] as well. Therefore, the effect size was taken as a 0.5% difference in the reduction of HbA1c indicating that the lowest significant reduction of HbA1c is 0.5%. A power of 70% and a 95% confidence interval with a drop-out rate of 20% were considered.\nThe following formula was used for sample size calculation:\nwhere N = Sample size q1 = Proportion of subjects in the meditation group q2 = Proportion of subjects that are in the waitlisted group Z\u03b1 = Critical value of the normal distribution at \u03b1 (\u03b1 is 0.05 and the critical value is 1.96) Z\u03b2 = Critical value of the normal distribution at \u03b2 (\u03b2 is 0.3) E = Effect size (0.5% difference in HbA1c between the two groups) S = Standard deviation of HbA1c in the population (0.8%)."

BMI is calculated as weight in kg/height in m2.\nClinical examination Blood pressure: blood pressure in the seated position will be measured after 10 min of rest using a Riester digital blood pressure monitor (Rudolf Riester, Germany). Blood pressure will be checked twice.\nLaboratory investigations FBS, HbA1c, lipid profile, fructosamine, fasting serum insulin and 24-h urinary free cortisol will be measured in an accredited laboratory. Fasting plasma glucose will be measured in a fully automated biochemistry analyser (hexokinase method), and the lipid profile will be measured by an enzymatic method. HbA1c will be analysed using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Insulin resistance will be calculated with the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) equation: fasting glucose (mg/ dL)\u00d7insulin level (uU/mL)/405 [4].\nOrocecal transit time The gold standard method to assess gastric emptying is radioisotope scintigraphy [31]. However, due to the noninvasive and simple technique involved, we opted for the orocecal transit time(OCTT) assessment using a hydrogen breath analyzer. Furthermore, by using OCTT, in addition to gastric emptying we can assess small bowel motility, which has an impact on glucose absorption and thus glycaemic control. Although there are more advanced newer techniques, such as MRI scans and capsular endoscopy [32], to assess OCTT, due to the high cost, these tests cannot be used in our study.\nLactulose hydrogen breath test The time interval between ingestion of test meal containing 10 ml of lactulose after overnight fast and rise in breath hydrogen 10 ppm above basal using hydrogen breath analyser (Gastrolyzer, Bedfont Scientific Ltd, UK) is a measure of orocecal transit time (OCTT) [33, 34].\nA solution including 10 g of lactulose in 100 mL of water will be administered. The breath test is performed at 10-min intervals, and a rise in hydrogen concentrations \u226510 ppm (particles per million) compared to baseline followed by at least two other subsequent rises are taken\nas OCTT. The OCTT in healthy subjects is between 40 and 170 min for a liquid diet [35].\nCardiac autonomic reflex assessment: CART Autonomic functions will be assessed using Human Physiology AFT equipment (PL2604 by AD Instruments Pvt. Ltd, Australia)\n\u2022 Heart rate response to deep breathing, which assesses beat-to-beat R-R variation during six breaths per minute paced slow deep breathing [expirationto-inspiration ratio (E:I)=R-Rmax/R-Rmin]. \u2022 Heart rate response to standing is expressed as the ratio between the longest R-R interval (between the 20th and 40th beats) to the shortest R-R interval (between the 5th and 25th) after standing from the lying position [23]. \u2022 Valsalva manoeuvre and calculate the Valsalva ratio (maximum heart rate in phase II: minimal heart rate in phase IV) \u2022 The blood pressure response after 3 min of standing \u2022 The blood pressure response to sustained hand grip\nWe will be recording a 15-min of resting ECG before the standard CART protocol. From which a 5-min recording [36] after the patient stabilizes, will be used for subsequent heart rate variation (HRV) analysis.\nSpectral analysis of HRV, both time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis of the 5-min resting ECG tracing, will be performed using a Power Lab 8 data acquisition system [37]. The following parameters will be assessed according to the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology guidelines(1996) [38].\nIn time domain analysis, SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals), SDANN (standard deviation of the average normal-to-normal intervals for each 5-min segment of the ECG recording), SDNNI (mean of the standard deviation of all the normal-to-normal intervals for each 5-min segment of the recording), and RMSSD (root mean square of successive RR interval differences) will be analysed. In frequency-domain analysis, VLF (absolute power of the very-low-frequency band: 0.0033\u20130.04 Hz), LF (absolute power of the lowfrequency band: 0.04\u20130.15 Hz), HF (absolute power of the high-frequency band: 0.15\u20130.4 Hz) and LF:HF (ratio of LF-to-HF power) [38] will be analysed. Pre- and post-meditation HRV analysis as well as any difference between the intervention and control arms will be compared. Furthermore, it has been shown that the cardiac\nvagal tone assessed using 5-min resting electrocardiogram recording has a good correlation with HRV analysis performed with 24-h recording in detecting subclinical cardiac autonomic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes [39]."

Although similar studies have been performed in other parts of the world, data from randomized control trials involving South Asians are lacking. As meditation intervention may have different outcomes in different populations, the results from our study will benefit the management of a growing population of patients with diabetes mellitus in our region. Furthermore, some of the possible mechanisms of how meditation brings about glycaemic control, such as its effect on autonomic function and gut transit time, will be studied for the first time in this trial. However, it is difficult to assess the generalizability and fidelity of the intervention across all patients as meditation is a highly individualised intervention which depends on multitude of factors. This is a shortcoming of this type of a clinical trial."
