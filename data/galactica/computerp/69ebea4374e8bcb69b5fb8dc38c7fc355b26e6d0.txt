In this paper we address the possibility that in a competitive facility location model, one of the existing competing facilities will go out of business. We find the best location for a new facility protecting against such a possibility. Four commonly used decision rules (optimistic, pessimistic, minimax regret, and expected value) are analyzed and optimally solved within a given relative accuracy. The results of extensive computational experiments are reported. Special upper bounds, that may be a basis for other optimization problems, are designed and run time was improved by more than 1,000 times. The largest instance of 10 existing competing facilities and 20,000 demand points was solved in less than one second by each of the four decision criteria. 1 conclusions We investigated the competitive facility location problem which is finding the best location of a new competing facility among a set of existing facilities that maximizes the market share captured by the new facility. There exists uncertainty about the future of existing facilities. It is possible that one of the existing competing facilities will go out of business. We find the best location for a new facility which protects against such a possibility. Four commonly used decision rules (optimistic, pessimistic, minimax regret, and expected value) are analyzed and optimally solved within a given relative accuracy by a specially designed branch and bound algorithm based on the Big Square Small Square procedure (Hansen et al., 1981). Special upper bounds that are needed for the branch and bound procedure are designed. Upper bounds based on the same idea may assist in developing upper bounds for other optimization problems. Results of extensive computational experiments are reported and analyzed. The largest instance of 10 existing competing facilities and 20,000 demand points was solved in less than one second of computer time by each of the four decision criteria.
