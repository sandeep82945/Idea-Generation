    "abstractText": "Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is a common finding in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease and has a distinctive role in these patients\u2019 quality of life. However, there is still a lack of evidence of correct patient selection for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). From July 2017 to August 2020, 68 patients with successful PCI of a CTO and previous evidence of viability for PCI by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were prospectively included in this single-centre observational study. Of these patients, 62 underwent follow-up CMR, and 56 underwent surveys using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire before PCI and 3, 12 and 24 months after PCI. The CMR results were assessed for volumetric, functional and deformation parameters. From the baseline to the follow-up, there was a significant reduction in the left ventricular volumes (all p < 0.001) and an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction (57.6 \u00b1 11.6% vs. 60.3 \u00b1 9.4%, p = 0.006). Among the deformation parameters, only the left ventricular radial strain showed significant improvement. The SAQ showed an early improvement that emphasised angina stability and frequency as well as a summary score, which persisted after 24 months. A low SAQ summary score before PCI was the best predictive factor of good clinical improvement thereafter. Improvements in myocardial function and quality of life can be achieved with PCI of a CTO. Patient selection for PCI should be performed primarily among relevantly symptomatic patients when evidence of viability for PCI is present. The SAQ can help guide such patient selection.

CTO has been described as inversely associated with event-free survival in coronary artery disease. Registries and meta-analyses have shown improved clinical symptoms and functional parameters in revascularised CTO [2\u20134]. Nevertheless, the presence of a CTO is the greatest predictor of incomplete revascularisation. This is due to, on the one hand, the low evidence of the prognostic benefit, and on the other hand, the higher rate\n* Johannes Kersten Johannes.kersten@uni-ulm.de\n1 Department for\u00a0Internal Medicine, Deputy for\u00a0Sports and\u00a0Rehabilitation Medicine, University Hospital Ulm, University of\u00a0Ulm, Leimgrubenweg 14, 89071\u00a0Ulm, Deutschland\n2 Heart Clinic Ulm, Ulm, Germany 3 Department of\u00a0Radiology, Armed Forces Military Hospital\nUlm, Ulm, Germany 4 Department of\u00a0Diagnostic and\u00a0Interventional Radiology,\nUniversity of\u00a0Ulm, Ulm, Germany\n1 3\nof major adverse cardiovascular events, the longer fluoroscopy time and the higher contrast agent requirement.\nCurrent ESC/EACTS guidelines on myocardial revascularisation recommend non-invasive diagnostic assessment of patients\u2019 myocardial viability for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) prior to an attempt at revascularisation by PCI [5]. However, data on correct patient selection based on non-invasive imaging are lacking [6]. The EURO-CTO study has already shown the symptomatic benefits of CTO-PCI [7], but which patients are likelier to benefit symptomatically from revascularisation remains a matter of debate. However, it is the symptomatology as a soft end point that is of crucial importance for the quality of life of our patients.\nThere are indications that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) detection of a sufficiently large perfusion deficit and of the patient\u2019s viability for PCI in the concerned coronary territory is likeliest to be accompanied by good symptom relief after revascularisation [3, 7]. CMR offers high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of myocardial ischemia and of the patient\u2019s viability for PCI. As the gold standard for determining cardiac volumetry and function, it also offers the possibility of deformation analysis using feature tracking in the post-processing. Due to its multimodality approach, it is an ideal tool for pre-diagnosis of CTO in patients.\nThis study attempts to answer the following questions:\n1. How do the symptomatology and functional parameters of cardiac function change longitudinally after CTOPCI? 2. Are there patient groups that particularly benefit clinically from CTO-PCI?"

The exclusion criterion for interventional revascularisation was transmural scarring of the CTO-related territory. This was defined as late gadolinium enhancement imaging (LGE) of more than 70% in three or more CTO-related segments. The included patients each gave their written informed consent to participate in this study before they were enrolled in it.\nSixty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. The patient enrolment is visualised in Fig.\u00a01. The patients were 66.7 \u00b1 8.1\u00a0years old, and most of them were men (75%) with a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, as shown in Table\u00a01.

The right coronary artery (RCA) was most frequently affected by a CTO (RCA, 63.2%), followed by the left anterior descending artery (LAD, 22.1%) and the left circumflex artery (LCX, 14.7%). The revascularisations were performed by a single operator (P.B.) predominantly in antegrade technique, with 9 retrograde procedures (13.2%). An example of a patient with a CTO of the LCX is shown in Fig.\u00a02. Adverse events occurred in 15 out of 68 patients (22.1%) included in the study.

To adjust the individual inversion time, a look-locker sequence in a short-axis orientation was performed 10\u00a0min thereafter. An inversion-recovery gradient-echo sequence for the evaluation of LGE was acquired in the same orientations as the cine image.\nAll the images were evaluated by two experienced examiners (J.K. and P.F.) in consensus using an established software (cvi42, Circle, Calgary, Canada). In cases of disagreement, a third investigator (P.B.) was consulted to make a final decision. They were blinded to the clinical data, SAQ results and time of image acquisition (before or after the PCI). The cine images were analysed for the left and right ventricular volumes and the myocardial masses. The ejection fractions were calculated correspondingly. Using post-processing feature tracking, the strain parameters were obtained. The LGE images were evaluated for the presence of myocardial scarring.

If the SAQ was enhanced only from 0 to 10 points, the response was low, and the patient was categorised in the \u2018low-responders\u2019 group. If there was no difference from the baseline to the follow-up or if the SAQ decreased, the patient was categorised in the \u2018nonresponder\u2019 group. The responder group was the largest, with 34 patients (60.7%), followed by the low-responders group (n = 17, 30.4%) and the non-responders group (n = 5, 8.9%).\nAs shown in Table\u00a04, there were no relevant differences in the baseline characteristics, especially with regard to age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors and medication (all p > 0.05). The angiographic characteristics likewise did not significantly differ between the responders, low-responders and non-responders groups. In the baseline CMR, there was, at most, a tendency towards lower-left ventricular volumes and discretely better left ventricular function in the non-responders group, although no parameter fell below the significant\nlevel. This was also the case for the deformation parameters, as shown in Table\u00a04.\nThe symptomatology at the baseline assessed by the SAQ was inverse to the clinical improvement three months after the CTO-PCI.

(2) Significant anginal symptom improvement after revascularisation was seen. (3) The clinical responders to the CTO-PCI were primarily patients with pre-existing significant angina. Neither the baseline characteristics nor the initial cardiac volumetry or\nfunction had a significant impact on the clinical outcomes with regard to quality of life.\nThe left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes decreased by an average of 11.2\u00a0ml and 9.8\u00a0ml, respectively. In addition, the ejection fraction improved by an average of 2.7%. Smaller studies in 27 and 32 patients, respectively, showed comparable results [7, 9]. In a study by Galassi et\u00a0al., the increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction was up to 12.5%, which was more pronounced the lower the baseline ejection fraction [10].\nSurprisingly, the volumetric markers of the myocardial function were more markedly affected by revascularisation than were the deformation parameters. Only the radial strain showed significant improvements during the follow-up; the longitudinal and circumferential strains showed trends at best. In ischemic wall motion abnormalities, one would expect a change from the endocardial to epicardial layer.

The best values were obtained by the summary score with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72\u20130.94]. Accuracy was lower for physical limitation (AUC 0.67, 95% CI 0.53\u20130.81), angina stability (AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.63\u20130.91) and angina frequency (AUC 0.80, 95% CI 0.68\u20130.91)\n1 3\nessentially a longitudinal-oblique orientation, a reduction mainly of the longitudinal strain in the context of myocardial ischemia is to be expected [11]. It is possible that these internal muscle fibres are undergoing fibrotic remodelling, and therefore, little or no recovery can be expected in the longitudinal direction. This assumption was supported in a study by Zhang et\u00a0al., in which 55 patients who were examined via CMR feature tracking after CTO-PCI showed improvement only in their radial and circumferential strain but not in their longitudinal strain [12]. The effect of revascularisation on the strain parameters was more pronounced the lower the left ventricular ejection fraction was before the procedure. In this study, only 16/68 patients (23.5%) had an ejection fraction below 50% before the CTO-PCI, which might have contributed to the low degree of improvement in the deformation parameters.\nThe concept of improved myocardial contraction in vital but formerly inferiorly perfused areas is called hibernation and was recently challenged by the results of the \u2018Percutaneous Revascularization for Ischemic Left Ventricular Dysfunction\u2019 (REVIVED-BCIS2) trial [13]. In that trial, 700 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, impaired left ventricular function and imaging evidence of viability were randomised 1:1 to either interventional revascularisation or optimal medical therapy (OMT). There was no significant difference in the ejection fraction between the intervention and control groups at either 6 or 12\u00a0months. Considering only the patients with nearly complete revascularisation (anatomical revascularisation index > 80%), there was at least a trend in the primary end point (death from any cause or hospitalisation for heart failure) towards complete revascularisation. The incidence of CTO or CTO-PCI was not reported, although historically, they have been the most common factors of incomplete revascularisation.\nIn a previously unpublished post-hoc analysis of the \u2018Initial Invasive or Conservative Strategy for Stable Coronary Disease\u2019 (ISCHEMIA) trial presented at the 2021 ACC Congress, anatomically complete revascularisation was associated with improvement in the primary end point (cardiovascular death; myocardial infarction; or hospitalisation for cardiac arrest, heart failure or unstable angina), which was not previously demonstrated in the per-protocol analysis [14]. Unfortunately, these data regarding complete revascularization have not been published to date. A smaller study conducted on diabetic patients demonstrated significant differences in terms of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events between patients who underwent complete revascularization and those who did not [15].\nClinical improvement of patients after CTO-PCI in SAQ has already been demonstrated in other trials[7, 16, 17]. In this study, because of a relatively long follow-up period with repeated administration of interim questionnaires, it was found that the patients\u2019 symptoms deteriorated again\nover time. Whether this was due to the chronic progression of coronary artery disease, to general ageing processes or to isolated cases of late lesion failure could not be assessed. It is important to acknowledge the potential placebo effect resulting from the invasive procedure itself, as indicated by the findings of the \"Percutaneous coronary intervention in stable angina\"-trial (ORBITA) [18, 19]. This also may diminish over time. Despite the limitations of the ORBITA study, it highlights the importance of including a control group with a sham procedure, which would be highly desirable in CTO studies as well. The \"Sham-controlled Intervention to Improve QOL in CTOs\"-trial (SHINE-CTO) will hopefully provide clarification in this regard.\nThe present patient cohort was only treated with betablockers in 77.9% of cases and with other antianginal medications in only 16.2% of cases, indicating suboptimal antianginal therapy. However, it should be noted that this assessment of medication was conducted at the time of PCI, without considering previous or unsuccessful attempts at medical therapy. Furthermore, individual patient preferences regarding invasive therapy were taken into account on a case-by-case basis. In accordance with current recommendations, consideration should be given to CTO-PCI when conservative medical therapy fails to achieve adequate symptom control.\nThe aforementioned REVIVED study, wherein quality of life was assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, also showed a decrease at the 24-month follow-up. In such study, the symptomatology was no longer different from that of patients with OMT alone[13]. However, patients with angina that limited their quality of life were excluded. This reaffirms the importance of determining the symptom severity before performing CTO-PCI. The SAQ can be an effective tool in this regard, as shown. The cut-off value of 85 points in the summary score should be validated in further prospective studies."

            "text": "The single-centre design and limited number of cases of this study were its clear limitations. However, the main weakness of this study was the lack of a control group. In addition, a further differentiation of the cohort according to the degree of transmurality would have been desirable. On the one hand, this was due to the number of cases and, on the other hand, not possible in a reasonable way in view of the use of different vendors and field strengths.\nAuthor contributions Conceptualization, J.K., S.W. and P.B.; methodology, J.K., C.H., M.B. and P.B..; formal analysis and data curation, J.K., V.M., P.F. and Y.W.; investigation, J.K., P.F., V.M. and S.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.H., M.B., S.W. and P.B.; visualization, J.K., P.F. and C.H.; supervision and project administration, P.B.
