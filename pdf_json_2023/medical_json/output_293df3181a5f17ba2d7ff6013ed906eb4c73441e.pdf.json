    "abstractText": "Purpose: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a persistent metabolic condition with an unknown pathophysiology. Moreover, T2DM remains a serious health risk despite advances in medication and preventive care. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided evidence that probiotics may have positive effects on glucolipid metabolism. Therefore, we performed a metaanalysis of RCTs to measure the effect of probiotic therapy on glucolipid metabolism in patients with T2DM. Methods: With no constraints on the language used in the literature, Excerpta Medica Database, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science were searched for pertinent RCTs published between the date of creation and 18 August 2022. Stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied by two reviewers to independently examine the literature. The risk of bias associated with the inclusion of the original studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and Stata 15.0 was used to perform the meta-analysis. Results: Thirty-seven publications containing a total of 2502 research participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that after a probiotic intervention, the experimental group showed a significant decrease in body mass index (standardised mean difference (SMD) = \u22120.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) [\u22120.76, \u22120.08]), fasting glucose concentration (SMD = \u22120.73, 95% CI [\u22120.97, \u22120.48]), fasting insulin concentration (SMD = \u22120.67, 95% CI [\u22120.99, \u22120.36]), glycated haemoglobin concentration (SMD = \u22120.55, 95% CI [\u22120.75, \u22120.35]), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance score (SMD = \u22120.88, 95% CI [\u22121.17, \u22120.59]), triglyceride concentration (SMD = \u22120.30, 95% CI [\u22120.43, \u22120.17]), total cholesterol concentration (SMD = \u22120.27, 95% CI [\u22120.43, \u22120.11]), and low-density lipoprotein concentration (SMD = \u22120.20, 95% CI [\u22120.37, \u22120.04]), and an increase in high-density lipoprotein concentration (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.54]). Moreover, subgroup analyses showed that patients with a longer intervention time, or those who were treated with multiple strains of probiotics, may benefit more than those with a shorter intervention time or those who were treated with a single probiotic strain, respectively. Conclusion: Probiotic supplementation improves glucolipid metabolism in patients with T2DM, offering an alternative approach for the treatment of these patients.",

The main drugs used in the treatment of T2D at this stage are traditional insulin sensitizers such as biguanides and glitazones, traditional insulinotropic agents such as sulfonylureas and non-sulfonylureas, and newer insulinotropic agents such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors [3]. However, these medications have adverse effects. For instance, metformin may result in nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, a deficiency of vitamin B12, and an unsettled stomach. Similar side effects, including indigestion, constipation, bloating, nausea, and vomiting, have been reported for liraglutide. These adverse effects are more likely to be caused by combination therapies than monotherapies [4]. Therefore, a safe monotherapy with few side effects is urgently needed to treat patients with T2DM. An increased understanding of how gut microbiota influences metabolism has led to growing interest in the role that gut microbiota plays in the aetiology of T2DM [5,6]. Changes in the gut microbiota frequently accompany the onset and development of T2DM. For instance, compared with healthy individuals, patients with T2DM often have lower alpha diversity in their gut microbiota [7,8], in addition to a greater relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes, and a lower relative abundance of Gramnegative bacteria [9]. Given the strong relationship between host metabolism and gut bacteria, the composition of the gut microbiota offers an alternative target to guide the development of new anti-diabetic drugs. Probiotic supplementation has been shown to have beneficial effects regarding T2DM in numerous animal studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). For example, Ke et al. demonstrated that synbiotic interventions significantly decreased bodyweight and concentrations of fasting glucose, lipids, and other markers in mice with diet-induced obesity [10]. An RCT conducted by Sabico et al. showed that supplementation with a multi-strain probiotic decreased the insulin resistance index and concentrations of glycated haemoglobin and fasting glucose in individuals with T2DM [11]. Additionally, Kassaian et al. demonstrated that probiotics or synbiotics dramatically decreased concentrations of glycated haemoglobin in prediabetic patients [12]. Although several meta-analyses have found that probiotics alleviate the symptoms of T2DM, their clinical efficacy remains unclear because of the reviewed studies\u2019 small sample sizes, high heterogeneity, high risk of bias, and suboptimal analytical methods [13\u201316]. Therefore, we followed the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to perform a careful meta-analysis of how probiotics can be used to treat T2DM, with a focus on RCTs that were carried out in adults. Our aim was to identify the characteristics of potentially practical interventions\u2014such as the number of strains used, the route of administration, the length of a course of therapy, and the probiotics\u2019 ability to adapt to different physiological states of a host\u2014and to assess the general clinical efficacy of probiotic supplementation for the treatment of T2DM."

Effect sizes were combined using a random effects model (I2 = 89.6%, p = 0.000), and the analysis revealed that the experimental group had a lower BMI than the control group (standardised mean difference (SMD) = \u22120.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) [\u22120.76, \u22120.08]; Figure 3). We also conducted subgroup analyses on two intervention parameters, the duration of probiotic treatment (Figure 3a) and the bacterial strains used (Figure 3b), to further investigate whether probiotics have an effect on BMI in patients with T2DM.

We also conducted subgroup analyses based on treatment duration (Figure 5a) and the probiotic strains used (Figure 5b). This revealed that intervention durations of less than or equal to 2 months (SMD = \u22120.80, 95% CI [\u22121.41, \u22120.19]), 2 to 3 months (SMD = \u22120.43, 95% CI [\u22120.65, \u22120.22]), and 3 to 6 months (SMD = \u22122.30, 95% CI [\u22120.99, \u22120.36]) resulted in significant reductions in fasting insulin concentrations. Multi-strain probiotics (SMD = \u22120.73, 95% CI [\u22121.09, \u22120.37]), but not single-strain probiotics (SMD = \u22120.55, 95% CI [\u22121.19, 0.08]), were found to be effective in reducing fasting insulin concentrations.

            "text": "As the gut microbiota is crucial for preserving the body\u2019s normal metabolism, it is now recognised as a significant \u2018hidden\u2019 organ in the human body [53]. The makeup of the gut microbiota varies significantly between individuals, and it is influenced by a several variables, including genetics, diet, lifestyle, and health status [54]. The composition of the gut microbiota has been linked to the occurrence and development of T2DM, and an\nNutrients 2023, 15, 3240 20 of 25\nimbalanced gut microbiota stimulates the body to produce cytokines that reduce insulin sensitivity and accelerate the onset of diabetes [55]. To control the balance of the gut microbiota and reduce insulin resistance in patients with T2DM, Zhai LX et al. have proposed probiotic administration [56]. Probiotics are microorganisms that change the gut microbiota of their host, and therefore, they have a variety of effects; for example, they can preserve the gut microbiota\u2019s structural balance, increase the body\u2019s antioxidant concentrations, and reduce intestinal inflammation [57]. Bianchi et al. found that probiotics can safely and efficiently change a patient\u2019s gut microbiota, and they advised patients with metabolic illnesses to consume them frequently [58]. Lipopolysaccharides, which enter the blood to cause inflammation, disrupt intestinal integrity and influence the body\u2019s glucose metabolism, primarily by increasing concentrations of glycated haemoglobin; they are much more prevalent in patients with T2DM than healthy individuals [59]. However, Kim YA et al. found that patients with T2DM who consume probiotics have significantly lower lipopolysaccharide concentrations, less endoplasmic reticulum stress, and improved insulin sensitivity [60]. In this meta-analysis, the effects of probiotics on glucolipid metabolism were assessed in 37 RCTs involving a total of 2502 participants with T2DM. Analysis of the combined data showed that after treatment, patients in the probiotic group had significantly lower fasting glucose and fasting insulin concentrations than those in the control group. This suggests that probiotics can assist patients with T2DM to control their blood sugar concentrations. Problems with gut microbiota cause patients with T2DM to have significantly lower glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations than people without T2DM, which promotes gastric emptying in these patients and makes them feel hungry [61]. A hypoglycaemic effect can be produced via probiotic administration, as this promotes the production of glucagon-like peptide-1, thus inhibiting glucagon secretion and delaying gastric emptying [62]. This suggests that oral probiotics help to control glycated haemoglobin concentrations by promoting a glucagon-like peptide-1 release. More specifically, after treatment, glycated haemoglobin concentrations decreased to a significantly greater extent in the experimental group than in the control group. Additionally, the findings of this meta-analysis demonstrated that the change in HOMA-IR score after probiotic treatment was significantly greater in the experimental group than the control group. The HOMA-IR score reflects the equilibrium between hepatic glucose output and insulin secretion, allowing physicians to gauge the severity of a patient\u2019s insulin resistance. The abovementioned finding implies that in patients with T2DM, oral probiotics may reduce insulin resistance and improve insulin sensitivity. However, publication bias was present in the meta-analysis of the HOMA-IR score (p = 0.006), which may be due to the calibre of the studies included. Obesity is an independent risk factor for T2DM. Moreover, there are differences in the composition of the gut microbiota between obese and healthy patients, and disorders of the gut microbiota aggravate obesity [63,64]. Obese patients have elevated concentrations of cytokines, interleukins, the tumour necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharides, resulting in a chronic inflammatory state, which leads to metabolic disorders and obesity-related diseases [65]. Oral probiotics can increase the abundance of certain intestinal microbiota to therefore alleviate metabolic syndrome problems and improve immune function in obese adults [66]. The results of this meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in BMI and in TG, TC, HDL, and LDL concentrations. However, there was publication bias in the meta-analysis of the TG and TC concentrations (p = 0.006) which may be related to the quality of the studies included. TG and HDL cholesterol concentrations can be controlled by altering the composition of the gut microbiota [67]. This could occur via several possible mechanisms, such as a reduction in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts, the assimilation of cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract, and the conversion of cholesterol to faecal sterols in the intestine [68]. In addition, the activation of farnesol receptors may also modulate TG concentrations [69], thereby improving lipid concentrations [70]. Mechanisms of cholesterol removal via lactic acid bacteria have been proposed in previous studies. For example, probiotics were\nNutrients 2023, 15, 3240 21 of 25\nfound to purify bile salts by lowering cholesterol concentrations, due to the absorption of cholesterol by bacterial cell membranes via bile salt hydrolases [71]. Another study found that a probiotic mixture could modulate apolipoprotein synthesis via a mechanism that may be mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/farnesoid X receptor upregulation during enterohepatic circulation [72]. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and the Bifidobacterium subfamily may partially prevent hepatic steatosis and damage by regulating the activation of hepatic adenylate-activated protein kinase [73,74]. Supplementation with Bifidobacterium shortum B-3 inhibits the accumulation of epithelial fat and upregulates the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity [6]. The mechanisms of these effects may be diverse, and they need to be investigated further in vivo. In accordance with our subgroup analysis, patients treated with multi-strain probiotics experienced greater reductions in fasting blood glucose concentrations than those treated with a single strain of probiotics. Chapman et al. observed that multi-strain probiotics combinations offer more health benefits than any constituent strain alone [75], which is consistent with our findings. Synergistic interactions between probiotic strains may account for this effect, and they may be the result of functional groups interacting with one another to enhance the host\u2019s glycaemic parameters [6]. The following limitations apply to this meta-analysis. The probiotic doses varied significantly between the included studies, and some studies did not specify the doses used. Therefore, the effect of probiotic dose levels on glycaemic control in patients with T2DM requires confirmation in other studies. Guerrero-Bonmatty et al. showed that the combination of monacolin K (a statin) and L. plantarum strains was more effective in reducing LDL-C and TC levels in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia [76]. Therefore, in the future, some studies concerning probiotics in combination with statins, versus probiotics alone, could be considered. Moreover, general information about patients\u2019 ages and BMIs varied between the included studies, which may have increased the clinical heterogeneity of the sample used for this meta-analysis. In future research, there are many new probiotics, in addition to the traditional ones, worth considering for use at this stage. Since probiotics are excellent carriers or delivery devices, they can be recombined to orally deliver to antidiabetic targets [77]. Although probiotics are usually defined as living microorganisms, it might be worth considering whether dead strains are as potent, or even more potent, than live strains [78]. Although most of the probiotics that are widely used at this stage are lactic acid bacteria, there are also some potentially novel probiotics such as Akkermansia muciniphila, which also have antidiabetic properties [79]. In the future, further experiments and clinical trials will inevitably be needed to identify and compare the effects of different probiotic strains and dosages. Furthermore, the preparation technique and viability of probiotics, as well as the duration and regimen of good treatments, are also important factors that influence their antidiabetic activity."
