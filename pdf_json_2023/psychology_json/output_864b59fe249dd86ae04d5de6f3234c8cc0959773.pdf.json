    "abstractText": "Identifying oncological applications for drugs that are already approved for other medical indications is considered a possible solution for the increasing costs of cancer treatment. Under the hypothesis that nutritional stress through fasting might enhance the antitumour properties of at least some nononcological agents, by screening drug libraries, we find that cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs), including simvastatin, have increased activity against cancers of different histology under fasting conditions. We show fasting\u2019s ability to increase CBIs\u2019 antitumour effects to depend on the reduction in circulating insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 and leptin, which blunts the expression of enzymes from the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and enhances cholesterol efflux from cancer cells. Ultimately, low cholesterol levels through combined fasting and CBIs reduce AKT and STAT3 activity, oxidative phosphorylation and energy stores in the tumour. Our results support further studies of CBIs in combination with fasting-based dietary regimens in cancer treatment and highlight the value of fasting for drug repurposing in oncology.",

Under the hypothesis that nutritional stress through fasting might enhance the antitumour properties of at least some nononcological agents, by screening drug libraries, we find that cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs), including simvastatin, have increased activity against cancers of different histology under fasting conditions. We show fasting\u2019s ability to increase CBIs\u2019 antitumour effects to depend on the reduction in circulating insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 and leptin, which blunts the expression of enzymes from the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and enhances cholesterol efflux from cancer cells. Ultimately, low cholesterol levels through combined fasting and CBIs reduce AKT and STAT3 activity, oxidative phosphorylation and energy stores in the tumour. Our results support further studies of CBIs in combination with fasting-based dietary regimens in cancer treatment and highlight the value of fasting for drug repurposing in oncology.\nIt is estimated that 19.3 million new cancer cases and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths occurred worldwide in 2020. In 2040, the global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4million cases, corresponding to a 47% rise from 20201. One of the greatest challenges in this scenario is represented by the cost of agents that can be used to treat cancer or prevent it in predisposed subjects, a challenge that becomes even greater in developing countries2. Finding uses in oncology that are outside the scope of the original medical indication of existing drugs (drug repurposing) has been proposed as a possible solution for this issue3, 4. Drug repurposing typically foresees reduced time and risk over de novo drug discovery anddevelopment since already-approved drugs have previously gone through the different phases of development for their original indication3,4. Notable examples of nononcological drugs repurposed to treat cancer include thalidomide as a treatment for multiple myeloma and all-trans retinoic acid for acute promyelocytic leukaemia3,5. In addition, other already-approved agents are currently being studied in oncological clinical trials6. However, there remains a crucial need to identify more drugs that lend themselves to this type of use. Studies show that short-termextreme dietary restriction orwateronly fasting confer powerful antitumour activity to the antidiabetic drug,metformin, and to vitaminC (especially in tumourswithmutated\nReceived: 30 January 2023\nAccepted: 17 October 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, University of Genoa, Viale Benedetto XV 6, 16132 Genoa, Italy. 2Ospedale Policlinico San Martino IRCCS, Largo RosannaBenzi 10, 16132Genoa, Italy. 3Department of ExperimentalMedicine, University of Genoa, Via Leon Battista Alberti 2, 16132Genoa, Italy. 4Department ofMedicine andSurgery, University of Parma, 43125 Parma, Italy. 5Department of FoodandDrug,Universityof Parma, 43124Parma, Italy. 6Center of Translational and Experimental Myology, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, 16147 Genoa, Italy. 7These authors jointly supervised this work: Irene Caffa and Alessio Nencioni. e-mail: irene.caffa@unige.it; alessio.nencioni@unige.it\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6951 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nKRAS)7\u20139. Taken together with the results of clinical trials indicating the feasibility and overall safety of this type of dietary interventions in patients10\u201313, these studies suggest that the nutritional stress imposed by fasting or fasting-based diets could be a viable approach to reveal new drug vulnerabilities and thus, help with drug repositioning in oncology.\nIn this work,we screen drugs that are already approved for clinical uses, searching for agents that acquire antitumour effects in the presence of culture conditions designed to recreate the metabolic effects of fasting [fasting-mimicking (FM) culture conditions, FMCC] (Fig. 1a). Using this approach, we show fasting to enhance the anti-tumour activity of several cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs) via reduced AKT-STAT3 signalling and oxidative phosphorylation."

Consistent with this hypothesis, we found FMCC to also confer strong cytotoxic activity to itraconazole, another 14\u03b1-demethylase inhibitor, simvastatin, a 3- hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor and to the squalene epoxidase (SQLE)16,17 inhibitors, terbinafine, butenafine and liranaftate in PK9 andCapan-1 PDAC cells and inHCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1a-e). FMCCcooperated with clotrimazole and terbinafine to reduce intracellular cholesterol in cultured Capan-1 cells (Fig. 1e). Methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD), which acutely depletes intracellular cholesterol18, also had its antitumour effects enhanced by FMCC in Capan-1 PDAC cells and, when added to combined FMCC and azoles or FMCC and terbinafine, it further reduced Capan-1 cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Finally, cancer cell supplementation with a water-soluble cholesterol formulation (cholesterol-M\u03b2CD) attenuated the cooperation between FMCC and CBIs in Capan-1 and HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1g, h). Taken together, these findings indicate that FMCC and CBI\u2019s cooperate to lower intracellular cholesterol and that the antitumour effects of combined CBIs and FMCC reflect the lower cholesterol levels in cancer cells. Exposing cells to FMCC implies lowering FBS in the tissue culture medium by 90% (from 10% to 1%). As a result, cholesterol concentration in the medium will also be reduced to a similar extent. Therefore, we assessed whether FMCC-mediated enhancement of CBIs\u2019 activity reflected the reduction in cholesterol availability to cancer cells, a condition that does not occur in vivo during short-term fasting (see below) and that could artificially force cancer cells to rely on endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol concentration in regular FBS is 0.9mM19. Therefore, in a standard tissue culturemedium,which contains 10% FBS, cholesterol concentration can be estimated to be ~90 \u00b5M. We found that FMCC retained their ability to enhance CBIs\u2019s activity even when the FMCC medium was supplemented with LDL plus HDL cholesterol (at a 3:1 ratio) to recreate a final cholesterol concentration that was similar to that found in standard cell culture medium ( ~ 90 \u00b5M; Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 1i). Even when we supplemented FMCC medium with LDL and HDL cholesterol (always at a 3:1 ratio) to reach a final cholesterol concentration that was similar to that from human interstitial fluids,which represent the microenvironment bodily tissues, including cancer cells, are exposed to (i.e., ~1mM)20, we still found the cooperation between FMCC and CBIs to be readily detectable (Supplementary Fig. 1j). Thus, these findings indicated that FMCC-mediated enhancement of CBIs antitumour activity did not reflect reduced cholesterol availability to cancer cells through reduced FBS.\nCBIs\u2019 potentiation through FMCC was not restricted to gastrointestinal cancer cells. A drug screen in A549 lung cancer cells also showed the imidazole derivatives to became cytotoxic for lung cancer cells when used in the presence of FMCC (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In addition, we found FMCC to increase the anticancer activity of CBIs in other CRC and PDAC cell lines, as well as in lung, ovarian, stomach, breast, prostate and melanoma cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2b-g and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Therefore, taken together, these data suggest a broad antitumour effect of this combined treatment. Finally, we tested CBIs and FMCC in CRC tumour organoids (OMCR15-045TK and OMCR16-005TK)21 and also in these models, a striking synergy between the two interventions in terms of organoid growth inhibition was observed (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. 3c and Supplementary Movie 1).\nFasting enhance CBIs\u2019 antitumour activity in vivo We subsequently evaluated whether periodic fasting cycles would also enhance CBIs\u2019 anticancer activity in vivo utilizing different mouse models of solid tumours. Weekly cycles of 48h water-only fasting boosted terbinafine and clotrimazole antitumour effects in Capan-1 xenograft-bearing mice (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Consistent with the hypothesis that CBIs cooperate with fasting by\nreducing cholesterol in cancer cells, we found terbinafine plus fasting to blunt the cholesterol content of Capan-1 xenografts (Fig. 2c). Combined fasting and terbinafine did not affect total serum cholesterol levels or serumHDL cholesterol inmice (Fig. 2d, e). However, this combination reduced LDL cholesterol, which is the main form of cholesterol transport from the liver to peripheral tissues, including tumours (Fig. 2e) and caused a consistent increase in the HDL/LDL ratio. Weekly fasting cycles also sensitized HCT116 xenografts to both simvastatin and clotrimazole (Fig. 2f-i). In this model, we also found that adding back LDL cholesterol in mice treated with fasting cycles plus clotrimazole abolished the enhancement of the CBI\u2019s activity through fasting and, consistently, restored intratumour cholesterol content (Fig. 2h-j). Thus, thesefindings are also in linewith the effect of combined clotrimazole and fasting reflecting cholesterol depletion in cancer cells. We documented a marked enhancement of clotrimazole antitumour activity in immunocompetent mice, i.e. C57BL/6, in which we had established subcutaneous allografts of the melanoma cell line, B16 (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Finally, since previous studies showed the ability of fasting to synergize with several, commonly used chemotherapeutics22, we compared the activity of the combination, fasting plus terbinafine, with that of combined fasting and oxaliplatin inCapan-1 xenograft-bearing animals. Here,we foundboth regimens to be very active, with essentially no difference in terms of their ability to control tumour growth over time (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e).\nAltogether, these experiments confirmed that fasting and CBIs cooperate to reduce intratumour cholesterol levels and that this effect is a key determinant of the antitumour effect that is obtained by combining the two interventions.\nToxicity of fasting, CBIs and their combination Supplementary Table 2 shows the blood counts and the biochemistry tests that we performed in animals receiving clotrimazole, weekly 48 h fasting or their combination w/ or w/o add back of LDL-cholesterol (Fig. 2h), while Supplementary Table 3 shows the blood tests we performed in mice treated with simvastatin, weekly fasting or their combination (Fig. 2f). In both experiments, fasting caused an increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), a marker of liver damage. Combined fasting and simvastatin raised both the levels of AST and of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), anothermarker of acute liver damage, while in response to fasting plus clotrimazole, a significant increase in AST could not be documented. In both experiments, fasting, but not fasting plus the CBI, was also associated with higher serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), amarker ofmuscle injury/myopathy. Fasting, but not fasting plus clotrimazole, reduced total white blood cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes (Supplementary Table 2). The clinical parameters that we routinely monitored to detect pain or distress in mice (i.e. behaviour, posture, bodily functions, weight loss) failed to show signs of higher toxicity of fasting plus a CBI as compared to just weekly fasting. For instance, no worsening of fasting-induced weight loss could be detected with the concomitant administration of fasting plus a CBI as compared with just fasting and neither did adding a CBI to fasting affect mouse ability to re-gain weight after the fasting cycles (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).\nWe also evaluated potential toxicities of fasting, CBIs and their combination in vitro, using non-malignant human cells, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) which mostly consist of CD3+ T lymphocytes, and the pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line, HPNE. As compared to resting/unstimulated PBMCs, PBMCs that were stimulated with the mitogen phytohemoagglutinin (PHA) showed higher sensitivity to FMCC, becaming more apoptotic in response to these conditions (Supplementary Fig. 5c). However, neither in resting nor in activated PBMCs, did we detect a cooperation between FMCC andCBIs, including simvastatin, in terms of ability to induce apoptosis. HPNE cells also proved very sensitive to FMCC, since these culture conditions reduced cell viability by ~60% (Supplementary Fig. 5d).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6951 3\nHowever, neither the chemotherapeutic, oxaliplatin, nor the CBIs acted synergistically with FMCC to reduce cell viability. Instead, the interaction between drugs and FMCC was mostly either additive or even infra-additive in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 5d).\nRegulation of tumour cholesterol metabolism by fasting We subsequently focused on the mechanisms through which FMCC (in vitro) and fasting (in vivo) enhanced the anticancer effects of CBIs. Specifically, we first assessed whether FMCC would make CBIs more actve in cancer cells through the reduction in glucose or, rather, in growth factors. Restoring normal glucose levels in cell culture did not have any effect on the potentiation of clotrimazole or terbinafine activity via FMCC (Fig. 3a). Conversely, restoring serum levels to those present in standard culture conditions (10% FBS) completely abolished the cooperation between FMCC and CBIs (Fig. 3a). We verified that in mice, fasting with or without clotrimazole reduced Igf1, c-peptide (a marker of insulin production) and leptin (Fig. 3b), three fastingreduced factors (FRFs) which we and others previously found to partake in fasting-mediated enhancement of the activity of chemotherapy and of endocrine therapies for breast cancer10,22,23.

Consistent with these results, this cocktail of proteins also abolished FMCC-mediated potentiation of terbinafine activity in terms of intracellular cholesterol depletion in culturedCapan-1 cells (Fig. 3d). Similar to LDL cholesterol add-back, administering recombinant insulin, IGF1 and leptin to Capan-1 xenograft-bearing mice abolished fasting-induced enhancement of terbinafine activity (Fig. 3e, f) and it also restored cholesterol content in the tumours (Fig. 3g). Therefore, altogether these data indicated a non-redundant role for the reduction in IGF1, insulin and leptin in the synergy between fasting and CBIs.\nConcerning the mechanisms whereby the fasting-induced reduction in insulin, IGF1 and leptin mediates cancer cell sensitization to CBIs, we first focused on the expression of enzymes from the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This was done in view of studies showing that these circulating factors and the signalling cascades they trigger (such as the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway) can activate the cholesterol productionpathway through variousmechanisms, including increased expression and activity of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), a transcription factor that promotes the expression of genes encoding for cholesterol-producing enzymes24, 25. In Capan-1 xenografts, we found the expression of several enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1), isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1 (IDI1), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), lanosterol synthase (LSS), 24- dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) to be reduced in response to fasting and/or to fasting plus terbinafine (Fig. 4a). The add-back of insulin, IGF1 and leptin prevented HMGCS1, IDI-1, FDPS and LSS downregulation occurring in response to fasting plus terbinafine, whereas in the case of DHCR24 and DHCR7 expression, we could not detect a significant rescue effect in response to the addback of the three factors. We also readily detected downregulated DHCR24 and SQLE expression in protein lysates from HCT116 xenografts which were treated with weekly fasting plus clotrimazole (Fig. 4b). We could not demonstrate any effect of fasting or fasting plus terbinafine on LDL receptor expression, both at the mRNA and at the protein level (Fig. 4c, d), suggesting that LDL receptor-mediated cholesterol uptake is unlikely to be affected by these interventions. Altogether, these findings indicate that several cholesterol-producing enzymes become downregulated in tumour xenografts after treatment with fasting and/or with fasting combined with a CBI and that the fasting-induced reduction in circulating insulin, IGF1 and leptin takes part in the downregulation of at least some of these enzymes.\nNot only does the intracellular cholesterol content depend on cholesterol biosynthesis and on the uptake of circulating cholesterol, but it also depends on the degree of cholesterol efflux from the cell26. This is considered to be the first step of cholesterol return from peripheral tissues to the liver for biliary excretion, a process also known as\nreverse cholesterol transport26. Non-esterified cholesterol is effluxed from cells to extracellular HDLs through the action of transporters, such as ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 1 (ABCA1) and ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily GMember 1 (ABCG1)26. Specifically, ABCA1 mediates the secretion of cellular free cholesterol to the extracellular acceptor, apolipoprotein AI (APO-AI), to form nascent HDL, while ABCG1 promotes free cholesterol efflux to mature HDL. Studies show that insulin27\u201329, IGF130\u201332 and leptin33 all have the ability to negatively affect cholesterol efflux. In this context, insulin was shown to dampen ABCG1 expression and to down-regulate ABCA1 activity through its specific phosphorylation28, 29. Leptin was reported to accelerate cholesteryl ester accumulation in human macrophages by increasing ACAT1 expression via JAK2 and PI3K, thereby suppressing HDLmediated cholesterol efflux33. In Capan-1 xenografts, we found weekly fasting and fasting plus terbinafine to increase ABCG1 expression both at the mRNA and at the protein level (Fig. 5a, b). However, when insulin, IGF1 and leptinwhere administered to themice receiving fasting plus terbinafine, ABCG1 upregulation was abolished (Fig. 5a). No increase in ABCA1 expression in response to these treatments was observed (Fig. 5b). A higher ABCG1 expression in response to fasting plus simvastatin was also detected in HCT116 xenografts treated with simvastatin plus fasting (Fig. 5c). In the latter model, combined fasting and simvastatin also downregulated ACAT1 expression (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the in vivo evidence that fasting stimulates ABCG1, but not ABCA1 expression, we observed that in vitro, cholesterol efflux from both HCT116 andMCF7 cancer cells only increased under FMCC when HDLs, but not ApoA-I were used as acceptors (Fig. 5d).Moreover,when the FMCCmediumwas supplementedwith insulin, IGF1 and leptin, this enhancement in cholesterol efflux to HDL through FMCC was less pronounced as compared to regular FMCC (Fig. 5d). Therefore, these findings are consistent with fasting promoting cholesterol efflux in these cancer cells through reduced insulin, IGF1 and leptin levels. Finally, in line with the ability of fasting to increase ABCG1 expression in tumours in vivo and thus, conceivably, to enhance cholesterol efflux to mature HDLs, we found the administration of HDLs to Capan-1 xenograft-bearing mice to increase fasting\u2019s ability to reduce intratumour cholesterol and to slow tumour growth (Fig. 5e\u2013g).Overall, these results indicate that fasting promotes cholesterol efflux via ABCG1 and possibly also via reduced ACAT1 expression, at least in some types of tumour cells. In turn, fasting-induced cholesterol efflux is likely to contribute to lower cholesterol content inside cancer cells.\nCombined fasting and CBIs blunt AKT and STAT3 activity In subsequent experiments, we studied the effects of cholesterol depletion via fasting, CBIs and their combination on the main signalling cascades controlling cancer cell proliferation and survival, such as PI3K-AKT, Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT, and MAP kinase signalling34. Combined treatment with CBIs and fasting blunted AKT phosphorylation in Capan-1 and HCT116 tumour xenografts, as well as in CRC tumour organoids (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 6a\u2013c). In HCT116\nFig. 2 | In vivo activity of cyclic fasting and CBIs against PDAC and CRC xenografts. a\u2013e Capan-1 xenografts were established in 6-8-week-old female athymic nudemice. Once tumours were palpable, mice were randomized to be treated with ad libitum diet (n = 12), weekly 48h water-only fasting (\u201cfasting\u201d; n = 12), terbinafine (40mg/kg/day for five days a week; n = 10) or combined fasting plus terbinafine (n = 12). Tumour volume wasmonitored at the indicated time points (a). At the end of the experiment, the excised tumourswere weighted (b) and used for cholesterol content determination (c). Peripheral blood was collected before treatment onset and at the endof the experiment and serumwasused todetect total cholesterol (d), HDL and LDL cholesterol (e) by standard biochemistry. HDL and LDL cholesterol concentration was used to determine the HDL/LDL ratio (e). HCT116 xenografts were established in 6-8-week-old female athymic nude mice. Once tumours were palpable,mice were randomized to be treatedwith ad libitum diet (n = 7 in (f); n = 8 in h), weekly 48h water-only fasting (n = 9 in f; n = 6 in h), simvastatin (in f, 80mg/\nkg/day; n = 7), combined fasting plus simvastatin (in f, n = 10) clotrimazole (in h, 60mg/kg twice aweek;n = 7), combined fasting plus clotrimazole (inh, n = 8), or fasting, clotrimazole and human LDL (in h, 0.25mg/mouse twice a week coupled with fasting; n = 6). Tumour volume was monitored at the indicated time points (f, h). At the end of the experiment, tumours were weighted (g, i), imaged (g) and utilized for intratumour cholesterol determination (j). In (a, f, h), n indicates the number of tumours per treatment group. In (b, c\u2013e, g, i, j), data points are biological replicates: they represent single tumours (b, c, g, i, j) or sera from different animals (d, e).

Cholesterol plays a key role in lipid raft integrity, which in turn, is required for prooncogenic signalling at this level, including PI3K-AKT signalling35.

Supplementation of the culture medium with insulin, IGF1 and leptin avoided AKT inhibition by terbinafine plus FMCC in Capan-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6e), which is in line with the ability of these proteins to prevent the enhancement of terbinafine\u2019s activity in cancer cells by fasting in terms of cell viability, cholesterol content and in vivo growth (Fig. 3c\u2013g). Restoration of AKT phosphorylation by insulin, IGF1 and leptin in cells treated with terbinafine plus FMCC was prevented by intracellular cholesterol depletionwithM\u03b2CD (Fig. 6b), supporting the notion that the effect of supplemented insulin, IGF1 and leptin on AKT activation (in cells treated with FMCC plus CBIs) reflects their ability to increase cholesterol content inside the cancer cell. Capan-1 and PANC-1 PDAC cells transductionwith constitutively active,myristoylatedAKT (myr-AKT)10 conferred significant protection from combined CBIs and FMCC (Supplementary Fig. 6f).

Ultimately, AKT inhibition plays an important role in the antitumour activity of combined CBIs and fasting.\nIn subsequent experiments, we focused on JAK-STAT signalling, using STAT3 phosphorylation as a readout. STAT3 is phosphorylated and thereby activated by receptor-associated JAK in response to stimuli such as leptin or IL6 and consequently translocates to the cell nucleus, where it promotes the expression of genes with antiapoptotic and pro-proliferative effects36. CBIs and fasting cooperated to reduce STAT3 phosphorylation in both Capan-1 and HCT116 xenografts (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7a, respectively). LDL cholesterol add-back prevented the reduction in phosphorylated STAT3 in HCT116 xenografts treatedwith clotrimazole plusweekly fasting, again indicating a role for cholesterol depletion achieved by combined CBIs and diet in STAT3 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Signalling through lipid raft microdomains was proposed to be a mechanism through which extracellular clues activate STAT signalling, including STAT337, 38. Accordingly, in lipid rafts isolated from HCT116 after treatment with combined FMCC and clotrimazole (which, by reducing intracellular cholesterol, conceivably disrupted membrane lipid raft integrity), STAT3 phosphorylation was abolished (Supplementary Fig. 7b). As in the case of AKT phosphorylation, we found that supplementation of the cell culture medium with insulin, IGF1 and leptin prevented the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by combined terbinafine and FMCC (Fig. 6b). However, this rescue of STAT3\nphosphorylation by insulin, IGF1 and leptin was no longer detectable when the cancer cells were treated with the cholesterol-depleting agent M\u03b2CD. Therefore, these data indicate that insulin, IGF1 and leptin restore STAT3 activation in cancer cells treated with FMCC plus CBIs through their ability to increase intracellular cholesterol content (Fig. 3d). Engineering HCT116 and Capan-1 cells to express a constitutively active STAT3 (STAT3-C)39 conferred a partial protection from the antitumour activity of combined FMCC and terbinafine or FMCCand clotrimazole inHCT116 and inCapan-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7c, d). Transducing Capan-1 cells with both STAT3-C and myr-AKT conferred higher protection against combined CBIs and FMCC compared to transduction with just STAT3-C or myr-AKT (Fig. 6c). These results indicated that both AKT and STAT3 inhibition through reduced cholesterol play an important role in the antitumour effects of combined CBIs and fasting.\nCoupling fasting and CBIs increased ERK, JNK and p38 phosphorylation in Capan-1 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. 8a). One possible explanation for this effect is the oxidative stress that was experienced by the tumour xenografts in response to the combined treatments,MAPK signalling being part of the cell response to reactive oxygen species40. Indeed, we detected increased levels of malondialdehyde (a product of peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids) and increased activity of enzymes that counter oxidative stress (i.e., catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase) in tumours treated with CBIs and, to a higher extent, with\na\nre la\ntiv e\nba nd\nin te\nns ity\n0.5074 ad lib. fasting fasting+terb.terb.\nCapan-1 xenografts\np-AKT\nAKT\np-STAT3\nSTAT3\nad lib\n. ter b.\nfas tin g fas tin g+ ter b.\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n1 0.1135\n0.0061\n0.0466\n0.0279\np-AKT (Ser473)\nad lib\n. ter b.\nfas tin g fas tin g+ ter b.\nre la\ntiv e\nba nd\nin te\nns ity\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0.0002 0.0004\n0.0001\n0.0003\n0.0032\np-STAT3 (Tyr705)\n0\n40\n80\n120\nvi ab\nilit y\n(% )\nstandard CC terb.

JNK and p38, as well as excessive ROS production were reported to exert antiproliferative or even cytotoxic effects in certain contexts41. However, when testing whether a JNK inhibitor (SP600125), a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), would affect the antitumour activity of combined CBIs and FMCC, we failed to detect an effect of these inhibitors (Suplementary Fig. 8c, d). In addition,MAPK signalling activation was not consistently observed in response to combined fasting and CBIs in all of our models, e.g. no increase in MAPK signalling was found in HCT116 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. 9a) treated with CBIs, fasting or their combination (even though increased oxidative stress markers were also present in this model, Supplementary\nFig. 9b). Therefore, we did not further investigate the role of MAPK signalling activation in the cooperation between fasting and CBIs.\nFasting plus CBIs reduce tumour oxidative phosphorylation Studies show thatmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is active in cancer cells or evenmore in the latter than in healthy tissues and that it plays an important role in cancer progression, survival, and metastasis42,43. Cholesterol depletion through M\u03b2CD or statins was shown to reduce OXPHOS and cellular energy supplies via disruption of mitochondrial raft-like microdomains44,45. In addition, both inhibition of STAT3 and of AKT, as observed through the combination of CBIs with fasting, were also expected to hamperOXPHOS46,47. Thus, we investigated whether CBIs, fasting and their combination would\nindeed affect OXPHOS and energy stores in HCT116 and in Capan-1 tumour xenografts bymonitoring oxygen consumption, ATP synthase activity and ATP/AMP ratio. Both fasting and CBIs reduced oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis in tumours. This effect was achieved through impaired activity of both Complex I (pyruvate/malatedependent)- and Complex II (succinate-dependent)-driven pathways (Fig. 7a, b). Combining the two interventions compounded OXPHOS obstruction. In HCT116 xenografts, LDL cholesterol add-back prevented OXPHOS inhibition achieved by the combined treatments (Fig. 7a). Therefore, fasting and CBIs cooperate to reduce OXPHOS in gastrointestinal tumour xenografts by lowering cholesterol availability."

            "text": "Here, by performing screenings of clinically approved drugs and bioactive compounds, we identified several agents targeting different enzymes from the de novo cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, including simvastatin, which have their cholesterol-lowering effects and anticancer properties strongly enhanced through fasting. Several studies demonstrate the pro-oncogenic effects of cholesterol and of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes24. Enzymes involved in de novo cholesterol production are commonly deregulated in cancer cells24, 48. PDAC cells were shown to acquire cholesterol from their extracellular environment, but also to maintain cholesterol homoeostasis through de novo synthesis when extracellular availability is limited49.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6951 10\nAlterations in free sterol levels, including free cholesterol, were detected in PDAC models and in clinical specimens of PDAC patients, and elevated expression of several genes from the cholesterol synthesis pathway, including SQLE, was demonstrated to confer a worse prognosis to these patients50. Similarly, cholesterol was shown to have a central role in CRC progression51. Mechanistically, cholesterol is required by rapidly proliferating cells for the synthesis of new membranes24. In addition, cholesterol accumulates in specific membrane microdomains termed lipid rafts and stabilizes them by interacting with other lipids and with specific membrane-associated proteins24,52. In turn, lipid rafts harbour signalling proteins with important pro-proliferative, anti-apoptotic and growth-promoting effects, including AKT and STAT335,37,38. Therefore, our findings that fasting enhances CBIs\u2019 ability to lower intratumour cholesterol and to exert antitumour effects are of considerable interest, particularly in the light of evidence supporting the clinical feasibility and safety of fasting and modified fasting regimens10\u201313.\nOur data indicate that fasting enhances the ability of CBIs to lower cholesterol in cancer cells and that this effect is dependent on fastingmediated reduction in insulin, IGF1 and leptin. We identified two mechanisms through which the fasting-induced reduction in insulin, IGF1 and leptin cooperates with CBIs to lower intratumour cholesterol and to slow tumour growth. On the one hand, consistent with studies showing that cellular signalling from growth factors increases the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, (e.g. by enhancing SREBP2 expression and/or activity)24, we found fasting alone or combined with a CBI to reduce the expression of several enzymes from the cholesterol biosynthetic route and thedownregulation of at least some of these enzymes to be abrogated by concomitant insulin, IGF1 and leptin administration. We also demonstrated fasting to upregulate the cholesterol trasporter ABCG1 in tumours and to also downregulate ACAT1 in the HCT116 xenografts. Consistent with these results, we showed FMCC to boost cholesterol efflux from cultured HCT116 and MCF7 cells, an effect that was counteracted by the add-back of insulin, IGF1 and leptin. Thus, fasting appears to cooperate with pharmacological CBIs to lower cholesterol in cancer cells by at least two mechanisms: by downregulating cholesterol producing enzymes and by promoting cholesterol efflux.\nCBIs and fasting also synergized to inhibit AKT and STAT3 in PDAC and in CRC cells, an effect that was mediated by cholesterol shortage and, likely, by lipid-rafts disruption as suggested by the strong reduction in phosphorylated AKT and STAT3 at the level these membranedomains35,53. In addition, the very low levels of leptin, one of the main activators of STAT3 signalling36, that we detected in the serum of mice subjected to combined CBIs and fasting may also have contributed to impair STAT3 activation. AKT and STAT3 signalling play a key role in cancer cell growth34. Thus, the evidence we provide that combining CBIs with fasting cycles achieves a major inhibition of their activity strengthens the rationale for using this type of combined treatment.\nCBIs, fasting and especially their combination also had profound metabolic effects in cancer cells as they impairedOXPHOS andblunted cellular energy supplies. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that TCA cycle and OXPHOS are highly active in many types of cancer, includinggastrointestinal cancers, andplay an important role in cancer progression54\u201356. For instance, transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of PDAC cells revealed the reliance of the latter on mitochondrial respiration for cell survival57, while the mitochondrial protein, HSP60, which is responsible for maintaining mitochondrial function, was shown to play a fundamental role in the growth of PDAC cells58. Thus the observation that CBIs given together with fasting cycles affect OXPHOS in tumours is also of relevance for cancer prevention or treatment. BluntedOXPHOS through fasting could be explainedby the low availability of respiratory substrates to mitochondria (e.g., glucose) or by reduced STAT3 or AKT activity, given the ability of these\nproteins to enhance oxidative metabolism46,47. Concerning the effects of CBIs (when given alone or in combination with fasting cycles), our data are in line with studies showing that cholesterol depletion damages OXPHOS by compromising the integrity of mitochondrial raft-like microdomains44,45. In addition, OXPHOS inhibition could also reflect the marked inhibition of AKT and/or of STAT3 that was observed in response to the combined treatments46,47.\nAs for the toxicity of these treatments, fasting alone or in combination with a CBI was found to increase circulating transaminases (a sign of liver damage) and CK (a marker of muscle injury/miopathy), while lowering circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes. In healthy, human PBMCs and in non-cancerous pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (HPNE), FMCCdid not interact in a synergistic, but rather in an additive or even infra-additive fashion with CBIs, suggesting that these cells should be less sensitive than cancer cells to combined fasting andCBIs. The latter findings are also consistent with previous studies showing that in non-malignant cells, fasting may induce protection from, instead of sensitization to, chemotherapeutics and pro-oxidative agents22. In line with these data, adding a CBI to fasting failed to worsen the side effects that fasting by itself typically causes in mice (e.g., significant weight loss). Therefore, overall, combined fasting and CBIs appeared to be a relatively safe and well-tolerated treatment in our models. Yet, clinical trials exploring combined fasting andCBIs, should take possible liver and muscle toxicity into account.\nIn conclusion, our study lays the background for future clinical studies addressing safety, feasibility and efficacy of CBIs in combinationwith short-term fasting in patientswith cancer. In addition, further screenings of clinically approved agents could reveal more drugs that lend themselves for repositioning in oncology when combined with fasting-based dietary regimens."

Typically, CI values < 1, =1 and >1 indicate a synergistic, additive or infra-additive effect, respectively. Here, for increased stringency, we selected a CI \u22640.8 to identify drugs that synergistically interacted with FMCC. Statistical comparisons were performed using the tests indicated in thefigure legends.AP value lower than0.05was considered to be statistically significant."
