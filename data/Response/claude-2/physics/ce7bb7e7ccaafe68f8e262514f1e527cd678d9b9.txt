 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the anti-Malassezia activity of cordycepin and other bioactive components in the spent substrate extract through structure-activity relationship studies. This could lead to identifying the key structural features that contribute to anti-Malassezia effects. 

2. Investigate the effects of the spent substrate extract or its bioactive components on other fungi and yeasts that cause skin infections, such as Candida albicans. This could expand the application of the extract for treating fungal skin diseases.

3. Conduct in vivo studies using animal models to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the spent substrate extract or cordycepin for treating skin fungal infections before human trials. This is an important next step in translating the in vitro results to clinical applications.

4. Explore synergistic combinations of the spent substrate extract or cordycepin with existing antifungal drugs to see if combination therapy can improve efficacy and reduce resistance. This could lead to new antifungal formulations. 

5. Further analyze the chemical composition of the spent substrate extract to identify other bioactive components contributing to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These components could also be investigated for therapeutic potential.
