Robust and reusable self-organized locomotion of legged robots under adaptive physical and neural communications 1. conclusion We developed adaptive neural control by integrating the APC and ANC. The experiment results on Lilibot indicate that the
combination of the APC and ANC can enable more robust and reusable locomotion. It further confirms that the combination plays an essential role in reliable interlimb coordination generation in biological, as well as artificial systems.6 The main advantages of the proposed approach over existing locomotion control approaches, such as classic engineering techniques (Raibert et al., 2008; Hutter et al., 2016; Semini et al., 2017; Bledt et al., 2018) and ML (e.g., RL Nakamura et al., 2007; Heess et al., 2017; Hwangbo et al., 2019; Ishige et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2020, ant-colony optimization Juang and Yeh, 2018, intelligent trial and error Cully et al., 2015, and black-box optimization Thor et al., 2020) are as follows:
• It does not require robot kinematics, environmental models,
and predefined interlimb coordination (i.e., the interlimb coordination was achieved in a self-organized manner), • It does not require numerous attempts and long convergence
time (i.e., we were able to quickly generate robust and reusable self-organized locomotion within a few seconds (i.e., 9 s and 25 s for even and uneven terrains, respectively). These features make the proposed approach powerful and generic for developing robust and reusable self-organized locomotion for legged robots. The control based on the proposed approach is modular and developed with generic interfaces. It is flexible and offers the possibility of integrating it with other control strategies such as balance control through a reflex mechanism (Kimura et al., 2007) and navigation. Moreover, the control can be extended to various types of legged robots, such as hexapod, and octopod, because the adaptive neural control is organized by distributed identical local control circuits, and the relationships among the local control circuits are formed in an adaptive manner. This will enable the adaptive neural control to be used as a generic control algorithm for various legged systems in the future. Limitations of the proposed method are that some parameters were empirically set up, such as α and ρ of the FM, as well as phase shift, amplitudes, and offsets of intralimb coordination. The parameter values lead to the expected GRF with a predefined ideal shape and predefined foot trajectory, thereby reducing the adaptability of the control to some extent.
