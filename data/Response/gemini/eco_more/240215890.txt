1. **Investigate the impact of different budget constraints on the optimal contract design.** The paper assumes that the principal has a fixed budget, but it would be interesting to see how the optimal contract changes as the budget varies. For example, would the principal be better off using a piece-rate contract if the budget is very small?
2. **Consider the case where the agents have different cost functions.** The paper assumes that all agents have the same cost function, but it would be interesting to see how the optimal contract changes when the agents have different cost functions. For example, would the principal be better off using a bonus-pool contract if the agents have very different costs?
3. **Extend the model to include multiple tasks.** The paper considers the case where each agent has a single task, but it would be interesting to extend the model to include multiple tasks. For example, would the principal be better off using a contract that rewards agents for completing multiple tasks?
4. **Investigate the impact of information asymmetry.** The paper assumes that the principal has perfect information about the agents' costs, but it would be interesting to see how the optimal contract changes when the principal has imperfect information. For example, would the principal be better off using a contract that is robust to information asymmetry?
5. **Consider the case where the agents are risk-averse.** The paper assumes that the agents are risk-neutral, but it would be interesting to see how the optimal contract changes when the agents are risk-averse. For example, would the principal be better off using a contract that provides the agents with more downside protection?
