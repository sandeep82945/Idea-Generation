1. **Investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in MS using longitudinal imaging studies.** This could involve tracking changes in oxidative stress markers over time in people with MS, and correlating these changes with measures of neurodegeneration, such as brain atrophy or cognitive decline.


2. **Compare different imaging techniques for assessing oxidative stress in MS.** This could involve comparing the sensitivity and specificity of different techniques, such as MRI, MRS, and PET, in detecting oxidative stress in people with MS.


3. **Develop new imaging techniques for assessing oxidative stress in MS.** This could involve developing new MRI contrast agents or PET radiotracers that are specifically sensitive to oxidative stress.


4. **Investigate the effects of antioxidant therapies on oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in MS.** This could involve conducting clinical trials of antioxidant therapies in people with MS, and using imaging techniques to assess the effects of these therapies on oxidative stress and neurodegeneration.


5. **Investigate the role of oxidative stress in the development of new MS therapies.** This could involve studying the effects of oxidative stress on the development of new MS therapies, such as neuroprotective agents or immunomodulatory therapies.
