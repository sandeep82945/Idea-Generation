    "abstractText": "Open Access (OA) facilitates access to articles. But, authors or funders often must pay the publishing costs preventing authors who do not receive financial support from participating in OA publishing and citation advantage for OA articles. OA may exacerbate existing inequalities in the publication system rather than overcome them. To investigate this, we studied 522,411 articles published by Springer Nature. Employing correlation and regression analyses, we describe the relationship between authors affiliated with countries from different income levels, their choice of publishing model, and the citation impact of their papers. A machine learning classification method helped us to explore the importance of different features in predicting the publishing model. The results show that authors eligible for APC waivers publish more in gold-OA journals than others. In contrast, authors eligible for an APC discount have the lowest ratio of OA publications, leading to the assumption that this discount insufficiently motivates authors to publish in gold-OA journals. We found a strong correlation between the journal rank and the publishing model in gold-OA journals, whereas the OA 1 ar X iv :2 20 8. 08 22 1v 4 [ cs .D L ] 2 5 A pr 2 02 3",

            "heading": "1 Introduction",
            "text": "The unrestricted availability of Open Access (OA) publications is linked to the goal of granting all interested parties free access to scientific knowledge and ensuring greater equality of access (Munafo\u0300 et al., 2017). This view is strongly related to the consumers of scholarly knowledge, who then would not have to pay for access. However, when taking the authors of those articles into account, they are affected by OA in two different ways: a) when choosing a publication model for an article and b) when receiving citations (and along with its reputation) for articles that have been published via a certain model (usually described as citation advantage(Langham-Putrow, Bakker, & Riegelman, 2021)). Those two aspects of OA may introduce significant biases and inequity into the scholarly publication and reputation system since they may restrict participation in OA in particular ways (Bahlai et al., 2019).\nFirst, the OA publishing model generally shifts the publishing costs from readers to authors or their institutions and funders by introducing article processing charges (APCs). This can be a severe constraint for those authors who cannot afford these costs or do not receive any financial support. To overcome this issue, most publishers have implemented an APC waiver/discount policy for authors from, e.g., low-income countries (Lawson, 2015). However, it is open how the different options for OA publishing and waivers/discounts are considered and adopted by researchers with various characteristics such as their countries\u2019 income level, but also their seniority and gender \u2013 factors which are also often associated with the decision to publish OA (Iyandemye & Thomas, 2019; Olejniczak & Wilson, 2020; Simard, Ghiasi, Mongeon, & Larivie\u0300re, 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Zhu, 2017). Rouhi, Beard, and Brundy (2022) discussed the waiver issues from the perspectives of the publisher, institutions, and developing countries. They mentioned the potential unfairness authors are confronted with, which may be caused by APC-based models. They argued that waiver programs have yet to address this problem successfully. They suggested that meeting the equity standard requires a cross-functional approach involving publishers, funders, research institutions, individual researchers, libraries, and service providers.\nTo accommodate OA publishing costs, three funding options have emerged over time. First, Diamond OA journals are funded by public institutions such as libraries, which enable free reading and publishing for all researchers. Second, transformative agreements between public institutions and publishers have\nWhich Factors are associated with Open Access Publishing? A Springer Nature Case Study 3\nbeen introduced that include reading and publishing contracts and which are also funded by the institutions. In this case, there are no direct fees for authors, but their institutions pay for the APCs as part of a consortium. Access to publishing and access to publications is limited to participating organizations only. Thirdly, APCs could also be paid by the authors or their institutions themselves. The first option leads to Gold OA at the journal level. Transformative agreements allow authors to publish in either gold OA or hybrid (which \u2013 for a fee \u2013 allow publishing individual articles as an OA-variant) journals. The third option is often associated with hybrid journals. All other publishing models for journals usually require funding via subscriptions, resulting in closed-access articles (CA) that can only be read after paying the article or journal fee.\nThe publishing model is also strongly associated with the visibility of authors and articles. For many researchers, it makes a difference where, i.e., in which journals they publish (e.g., considering discipline-specific journal rankings). If they want to be noticed by others and/or seek promotion, it can be crucial to publish in reputable journals, especially for early career researchers. And to achieve this, not only financial hurdles and APCs have to be overcome, but, for example, English language skills and technical skills are needed, as well as institutions that can help with legal advice or infrastructure support. Against this background, researchers have to decide which publishing model to choose and whether OA is not only an altruistic but feasible option at all.\nThe second possible source of bias and inequity is related to the paying for access case: It has been shown already that articles published as OA-variants are more visible, leading to higher citation counts and altmetrics (Evans & Reimer, 2009; Fraser, Momeni, Mayr, & Peters, 2020; Lewis, 2018; McKiernan et al., 2016; Ottaviani, 2016). Moreover, the Matthew effect shows that researchers who are already well-known and widely cited receive even more citations (Farys & Wolbring, 2021) \u2013 which directly affects rewards for publication in prestigious journals, for prominence, and citations. For researchers, publications play a central role in their daily practice and the reputation system in which they operate. Publications enable researchers to build on the body of knowledge and refer to those findings by citing the publications (which accumulate reputation in this way). Hence, access to publications is crucial for the progress of science and building of reputation \u2013 which both can be impeded by a lack of access to OA publishing options and the risk of CA-articles not being cited as frequently as OA articles.\nFrom that, we hypothesize that researchers with better access to financial resources have better access to publications \u2013 both in terms of access to read openly and in terms of access to publish openly. Associated with that may be an even stronger citation advantage for those researchers (usually WEIRD: Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic; (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010)) with extensive OA-publishing options. As such, OA may carry the risk of perpetuating already existing inequalities rather than resolving such marginalization in the scholarly communication system (Fox et al., 2021).\n***"

            "text": "Related work also indicates a strong association between economic factors, OA, and citation advantages. The scientific output of countries is associated with their economic evolution because scientific progress needs governments\u2019 financial support. Samimi (2011) used a Granger Causality Test to examine the causal relationship between scientific output and GDP in 176 countries and found a two-way positive relationship between them. King (2004) compared published papers and their citation impacts across countries and found that only 31 countries contributed to 98% of the world\u2019s highly cited papers and that the remaining 161 countries contributed less than 2%.\nOpen Access publishing is also highly influenced by the authors\u2019 country of affiliation since it determines APC waiver/discount policies or the availability of transformative agreements with publishers. Some publishers offer general waivers or have a discount policy for all of their journals for eligible authors, and the country\u2019s income level mainly determines eligibility. Lawson (2015) has studied the waiver policy of the 32 most prominent publishers and found that 68% of them grant APC waivers. Simard et al. (2021) found that low-income countries publish and cite OA more than upper-middle and highincome countries. The positive correlation between OA citing and publishing is 1.3 times weaker for high-income countries than other countries. Similarly, Iyandemye and Thomas (2019) showed that biomedicine researchers from lowincome countries have the highest percentage in OA publishing. Smith et al. (2022) reported the proportionately fewer OA articles published in Elsevier\u2019s journals for low-income countries, despite their eligibility for APC waivers.\nOlejniczak and Wilson (2020) studied the articles published by faculty members at research universities in the United States and found that in the United States, male and senior authors are more likely to publish in OA form. Zhu (2017) conducted a survey with over 1800 researchers at 12 Russell Group universities1 to find the differences in OA publishing regarding discipline, seniority, and gender. Their results revealed disciplinary differences in OA publishing (Medical and Life Scientists are most likely to publish in Gold OA journals), more tendency toward OA publishing for senior authors, and across genders for men.\nThe journal rank is a decisive factor in submitting the article in addition to its business model. Schroter, Tite, and Smith (2005) conducted a survey study with 28 international authors who submitted to the BMJ and found that for authors, the journal\u2019s ranking is more important than the availability of OA.\nMany studies have investigated the OA citation outcome, and most found a citation advantage for OA articles (Evans & Reimer, 2009; Fraser et al., 2020; Lewis, 2018; McKiernan et al., 2016; Ottaviani, 2016). However, regarding biases (e.g., quality bias, self-selecting, mandating, self-archiving), different sampling and controlling data makes it difficult to conclude that receiving more citations is only the effect of OA. Momeni, Mayr, Fraser, and Peters (2021)\n1https://russellgroup.ac.uk/about/our-universities/\nWhich Factors are associated with Open Access Publishing? A Springer Nature Case Study 5\nstudied the citation impact of flipping journals from CA to OA and generally found a slightly higher growth in receiving citations compared to journals in the same discipline and the impact factor\u2019s range. However, they didn\u2019t observe this trend in all scientific fields. Momeni, Mayr, and Dietze (2022) examined the correlation between different factors and the future authors\u2019 h-index and found a positive but weak correlation coefficient between them.\nOne issue which is often discussed together with OA publishing and APCs is the problem of predatory publishing. Predatory publishers take advantage of the OA movement but work against the good scientific practice. Ross-Hellauer et al. (2021) did a systematic review to study the threat to equity in science via open science implementations. They concluded that less well-resourced researchers, researchers from non-English-speaking countries, and early-career researchers are particularly affected by the \u2018predatory publishing\u2019 problem."

But information about the history of the business model of journals is rarely available. In recent years, many journals have converted (flipped) from closed access to open access and vice versa, but often there is not enough information about the exact date of starting with the new access model. The Open Access Directory (OAD), a wiki hosted by the School of Library and Information Science at Simmons University2, is the only resource containing a list of a few flipped journals and the date of flipping. The open-access start date of journals was available in the DOAJ dataset until 2020. Bautista-Puig, Lopez-Illescas, de Moya-Anegon, Guerrero-Bote, and Moed (2020) and Momeni et al. (2021) used OAD and DOAJ for their studies about flipping journals. Unfortunately, DOAJ stopped collecting that information by now: \u201dAs time progressed, open access models became more complicated ... It has become harder to find the right answer to that seemingly simple question: when did open access start for this journal?\u201d3. Matthias, Jahn, and Laakso (2019) employed different snapshots of datasets that have the open access status (Scopus, DOAJ, Ulrichsweb, publishers\u2019 website, etc.) and some other resources to find out the reverse flip (converting from OA back to CA) and verified them manually. For the bibliometric analyses related to open access, it is necessary to know about the access status of journals for the period in which we study the effect of OA. Obtaining information more coherently requires looking into different journals\u2019 business models and harmonizing them to make them comparable. In addition, every publisher has its own rules for APC exemptions to foster publishing in OA format. For example, eligibility for APC waivers for publishing in Elsevier\u2019s journals is based on the\n2http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Main Page 3https://blog.doaj.org/2021/02/05/why-did-we-stop-collecting-and-showing-the-open-access-\nstart-date-for-journals/\nWhich Factors are associated with Open Access Publishing?

Various transformative agreements with publishers and the period of their contracts are other influential factors that should be considered in studying the publishing behavior of each publisher separately.\nDue to these varying APC-related rules for different publishers, we focused on one major publisher. To analyse papers for various disciplines and countries, we chose Springer Nature, the largest publisher of academic journals (more than 2,900 journals5) with worldwide authors from various disciplines, which provides us with a large amount of data and data diversity for more accurate results. Also, compared to Elsevier, the second most prominent publisher of scholarly journals (above 2,700 journals 6), this publisher has a higher OA update (Sotudeh, Ghasempour, & Yaghtin, 2015; Sullo, 2016), resulting in fewer data skewness.\nWe downloaded the list of journals and their access status from the snapshot from the year 2019 which is available on the publisher\u2019s website7. Three publishing models exist for these Springer Nature (SN) journals: Gold Open Access, Hybrid (with the open access option: Open Choice), and Closed Access. Figure 1 displays the distribution of journals and their publishing models.\nFor the bibliometric analyses, we employed Scopus8. We matched the list of SN journals with journals in Scopus via title and ISSN. From 3,138 SN journals, we could match 2,757 journals, which we used for further analyses. Because of the problems regarding journals\u2019 flipping mentioned above, we limited our data to two years, 2017 and 2018, to reduce the errors related to detecting the journals\u2019 and articles\u2019 business model.

From metadata in this dataset, we can obtain the publishing model of articles in hybrid journals.\nWe obtained the APC amount in dollars for 1,741 hybrid journals and 297 gold OA journals from the website of Springer Nature10. There was no fixed APC for 147 gold OA journals (only 5% of investigated articles belong to these journals), and we had to visit their website to obtain the exact amount for these journals. Therefore we replaced the APC amount for these journals with null values (empty) and excluded them from the data for the classification task.\nTo detect the gender status of authors, we utilized a combined name and image-based approach introduced by Karimi, Wagner, Lemmerich, Jadidi, and Strohmaier (2016), which categorizes the gender into male and female. Based on this method, we tried to detect the gender using the API Genderize.io 11. For those names that the API couldn\u2019t identify the gender, we looked for names on the web and detected their gender using image-based recognition algorithms which increases the recall and accuracy compared to Genderize.io (Karimi et al., 2016). We acknowledge that the person\u2019s gender is not a binary variable. Considering the social dimensions, more gender identities could not be identified with this approach and that is left out for the analysis. Using Scopus author ID, we found 381,074 unique corresponding authors for the investigated articles, and 10,614 authors (about 3%) had only initials or no first name, and we couldn\u2019t detect their gender.\nOverall, we identified the gender status for 49% of them. Therefore, we excluded 254,044 articles (about 49%) that we couldn\u2019t detect the gender status of their corresponding author from data in the regression analysis and classification task. One possible reason for a low rate of identifying gender is the large percentage of authors affiliated with Asian countries (136,591 above 35%)12 and probably originally from these countries. Previous studies tested gender detection tools for authors with different nationalities and found them to be less effective for Asian names (Karimi et al., 2016; Santamar\u0301\u0131a & Mihaljevic\u0301, 2018). Table 1 shows the number and percentage of OA and CA publications belonging to the corresponding authors with a gender status across scientific fields.

We obtained the list of involved institutions in the agreement by asking KEMOE/FWF, Bibsam, and FinELib organizations. The list of participating institutions via VSNU-UK was available on the website of SN 18. We assumed that the publications with the corresponding author affiliated with institutions included in the transformative agreement are free of APC charges.

Based on this approach, weighted PR (wPR) will be calculated using the formula:\nwPR = PRsc1 \u2217 nsc1 + PRsc2 \u2217 nsc2 + ... + PRsci \u2217 nsci\nnsc1 + nsc2 + ... + nsci (1)\nwhereby, sci is the ith subject category that the journal belongs to and nsci is the number of journals in this subject category, and PRsci is PR of the journal in it.\nTo present the citation impact of articles, we employed a similar normalizing approach. Because the citation count is confounded by time since publication, we consider the citations during a time window of two years since the publication, as in previous studies (Jannot, Agoritsas, Gayet-Ageron, & Perneger, 2013; Piwowar et al., 2018). Next, we categorized the articles into groups with the same subject category and publishing year and ranked them\n***"

Cramer\u2019s V is based on the chi-squared test and measures the strength of association between two variables. Its value ranges from 0 (no association) to 1 (complete association). The association with binary variables (OA agreement, discount eligible, waiver eligible, gender) was examined with Phi coefficient (Ekstro\u0308m, 2011). This correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1 and shows the strength of the positive or negative correlation between two dichotomous variables. To measure the association with other numerical or continuous variables, we applied the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient, which is used instead of the Pearson correlation when a variable is dichotomous (LeBlanc & Cox, 2017) and can range from -1 to +1."

Table 4 displays the relationship between the publishing model and features in Table 3 by considering all features in multivariate logistic regression. The results confirm the negative/ positive correlation calculated in correlation analysis, except the positive correlation between discount eligible and the publishing model is inconsistent with the result in the correlation coefficient. The highest Odds Ratios for Social Sciences among fields in Table 4 reveal the highest proportion of OA publishing in this field. This field has experienced a dramatic growth of OA journals since 2009 Liu and Li (2018). The strong positive correlation between journal ranking and the publishing model for the first set suggests that the journal\u2019s rank is the dominant factor in choosing a gold OA journal to publish. Therefore, we estimate the publishing model for articles in set 2 (hybrid journals) to discover other feature categories rather than journal-specific factors influencing the authors\u2019 decision for an OA option. Moreover, the optional choice of the OA model in hybrid journals better reveals characteristics leading to the OA model.\nTable 5 shows the performance of the RF classifier for the second set (hybrid journals). Figure 6 displays the permutation importance of features employed to predict the publishing model implemented for this set. The permutation importance of a feature shows a decrease in the model performance when the feature\u2019s value is randomly shuffled while the values of other predictors remain unchanged. A higher value for a feature shows more predictive power in the proposed model. The highest importance values for country income, and age in Figure 6 indicate that the most significant factors in selecting an OA model are the income level of countries and seniority. The lowest value for the variable gender presents that gender has a lower impact on the authors\u2019 decision for the OA model compared to other factors. OA agreement is one of the weakest\nWhich Factors are associated with Open Access Publishing? A Springer Nature Case Study 17\nfeatures in predicting the publishing model, and the correlation analysis also shows a weak correlation between them. One possible reason for the weak effect is that only 2.3% of papers have been involved in transformative agreements. In addition, the income level of countries is the most important feature, and regarding the positive correlation of this feature with OA publishing, it is more likely for authors from high-income countries (even without a transformative agreement) to publish in the OA model. This may also smooth the association of the agreement with OA publishing."

We found that authors from lower-middle-income countries with the eligibility to use APC discounts have a lower proportion of gold OA publications in all published papers by this publisher compared to other countries. It indicates that discounted APC is still too much for these authors to pay for a gold OA model and agrees with the statement of (Rouhi et al., 2022), who pointed out that waiver and discount issues couldn\u2019t bring author equity in reading and publishing. In contrast, this proportion of authors from countries with a low-income level who receive APC waivers is higher than authors from other countries. This result conflicts with the study\u2019s results by Smith et al. (2022), which found fewer OA papers proportions published by Elsevier for these countries compared to others. The reason can be stricter conditions, which this publisher considers for waiver eligibility.\nWe examined the citation impact of these articles and compared the percentage of highly cited papers among the publishing models and the income levels of the corresponding authors\u2019 countries. For all countries, the OA model in gold OA or hybrid has the highest percentage of highly cited papers. Also, the results demonstrate a higher proportion of highly cited articles for countries with higher income levels. Although it displays more citation impact for OA models, it can result from confounding factors such as self-selection and quality biases (Gargouri et al., 2010). Also, examining the preprint and green OA publishing (if the article has been published in the CA model, but a free version is available in a repository outside of the publisher\u2019s website) effect will result in more accurate analyses (Fraser et al., 2020; Wang, Gla\u0308nzel, & Chen, 2020).\nTo find more characteristics (e.g., author, journal, paper) related to OA publishing, we conducted correlation, regression, and machine learning analyses. The results of the correlation analysis displayed the strength of positive/negative correlation between the publishing model and every feature\nWhich Factors are associated with Open Access Publishing? A Springer Nature Case Study 19\ndefined in Table 2. Using regression analysis, we examined the association of each factor while accounting for other factors. The results reinforced the correlation outcomes. The only conflict between these two methods was the negative correlation between discount egibility with OA publishing in correlation analysis, but positive in regression evaluation. In addition, we estimated the publishing model of articles (OA or CA) using a random forest-based machine learning approach and examined the impact of each feature on the estimation task. The results show that the country\u2019s income and more experiences in OA rather than CA publishing are the most influential factors in estimating the publishing model. We discovered that the tendency toward OA publishing was slightly higher for women, but it was a less important feature than other features in estimating the OA model."

            "text": "One obvious limitation of this study is that we included articles from just one publisher, Springer Nature. Authors\u2019 publishing behavior may differ among articles published by other publishers, which limits the generalizability of the results of our study.\nWe obtained the access status of journals in 2019 based on the list published on Springer Nature\u2019s website (the same for the access status at the article level from Unpaywall). Some journals may have flipped from CA to OA (Momeni et al., 2021) or vice versa, and we did not detect them, which can cause errors in results. Furthermore, we did not control the correctness of external data (Springer nature and Unpaywall). The accuracy of these data affects the results\u2019 precision. We identified the gender of 49% authors and removed 49% of articles without gender status corresponding authors in regression and machine learning analyses. In addition, 2% of the data have been removed because of the null value in other features (e.g., journals\u2019 APC). Because the gender detection approach doesn\u2019t work well for Asian names, especially Chinese ones, we have a lower proportion of these authors with gender status in the dataset, which also creates biases in our analyses.\nFor future work, we can consider other publishers to examine how the different APC policies among publishers impact OA publishing. Also, controlling for articles\u2019 language in the analyses encourages future studies. Springer Nature is an international publisher and publishes mostly articles in English22, and articles in other languages are underrepresented in this study. considering other publishers with non-English content and the articles\u2019 language in the analyses can reveal the role of languages in publishing international OA articles and citation advantages.\n22https://support.springernature.com/en/support/solutions/articles/6000219817-are-any-ofyour-titles-available-in-other-languages-\n***"
