conclusion This paper suggests a multivariate segmentation approach for network delays. It takes advantage of the spatial correlation between pairs of a network and their temporal stability. The method is based on hierarchical clustering and on the Viterbi algorithm. The hierarchical clustering for time series enabled us to group a large number of series having similar patterns. We have seen that the linkage method adopted has an impact on the homogeneity of the patterns within the same cluster. Complete linkage tends to give more homogeneous clusters but does not have a big compression power, whereas Ward linkage gives clusters with a large number of elements. The spatial correlation within clusters has also been proved, since most clusters show the presence of common sources or destinations. When the clusters are defined, the process of segmentation begins by applying again the hierarchical clustering followed by the Viterbi algorithm. We have shown the impact of Viterbi smoothing on the enhancement of the segmentation quality. Its results are similar to the ones given by HDP-HMM. Finally, we have shown that the computational burden is reduced by a factor of 9 compared to HDP-HMM.
