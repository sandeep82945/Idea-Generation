F or other electronic format see DOI:\n296\nThe rst NHC-based selone was synthesized by reacting o-phenylenediamine with carbon diselenide in CCl4 to form 2-isoselenocyanatoaniline 1, and then product 1 was cyclized by the intermolecular reaction of isoselenocyanate with an amino group to obtain selone 2 in high yield (Scheme 1A).33 The interesting procedure of synthesis of stable selone compounds is by the reaction of an imidazolium salt with base and then the addition of elemental selenium. For example, diarylimidazolium salt reacts with selenium to form 1,3- diarylimidazole-2-selenones 3 (Scheme 1B).34\nPreviously, we reported the synthesis of some cyclophanes, including imidazole-2-thione units, such as 4\u20137, from corresponding imidazolium-linked cyclophanes (Fig. 2), and we studied their interesting conformational behaviour using X-ray diffraction and NMR studies.18 Many imidazole-2-selones are known.12,32,34\u201342 However, there are no reports of cyclophanes incorporating imidazole-2-selone moieties. As an extension of our study with imidazole-2-thiones, herein, we report the rst synthesis of some cyclophanes, including imidazole-2-selone moieties, and study their conformational behaviour in solution and the solid state as well as use DFT calculations. Imidazole-2-selone cyclophanes may have great potential in various elds, including medicinal chemistry, catalysis, materials science, and supramolecular chemistry. Further research is needed to explore their full potential and to develop their practical applications.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "The cyclophanes incorporating imidazole-2-selone units 8\u201311 were synthesized by the reaction of the corresponding imidazolium-linked cyclophane salts with selenium and potassium carbonate in methanol at 60 \u00b0C overnight. The products were precipitated from the mixture and recrystallized\nScheme 1 (A) The first synthesis of selone by reaction of o-phenylenedia of an imidazolium salt with Se.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nto obtain a white powder with a moderate yield. The conformations of the cyclophanes incorporating imidazole-2-selone units 8\u201311 were characterized using X-ray diffraction and NMR methods.\nStructures and conformations of imidazole-2-selones cyclophanes in solid state\nCrystals 8, 10 and 11 were grown by the slow evaporation of a solution of the relevant compound in CH2Cl2, while 9$(CHCl3)2 was grown by the slow evaporation of a solution of the compound in CHCl3. The results of crystallographic studies are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3\u20138.\nX-ray studies demonstrate that the conformation of cyclophanes incorporating imidazole-2-selone units 8\u201311 is broadly similar to that observed in the cyclophanes incorporating imidazole-2-thione units 4\u20137. For o-cyclophane 8, the benzene and imidazole-2-selone rings making a \u2018cup shape\u2019 and the orientation of C]Se groups are exo for the macrocyclic ring to yield conformation similar to the cone conformation of calix[4] arenes. The imidazole-2-selone rings are nearly parallel; therefore, the cup is slightly attened. Obviously, the bending of the C]Se bonds out of the N2C2 planes of the imidazole-2-selones is a result of steric repulsion between the Se atoms (Fig. 3).\nThe molecule structures form pairs to obtain interlocking cup conformation. Then, the pairs accumulate into columns because of interactions between the benzene rings (intermolecular distance between C6 planes is \u223c3.343 \u00c5 and 3.429 \u00c5) (Fig. 4).\nMesitylene m-cyclophane 10 also has a conformation similar to the cone conformation of calix[4]arenes. However, in this case, the imidazole-2-selone rings are separated. Therefore, the unfavorable steric interactions between the Se atoms and the methyl substituents in each of the benzene rings are nonexistent, and the \u201ccup conformation\u201d is now completely pinched. Obviously, the structure of the m-cyclophane allows for the separation of the selone rings such that the C]Se bond is not bent outside the C3N2 plane (cf. the case of o-cyclophane 8).

The 1H NMR spectrum of 8 is consistent with the structure shown in the solid state, in which the cyclophane macrocycle adopts a cone conformation. H4/H5 protons in the imidazole-2-selone ring show a remarkably upeld chemical shi (\u223c5.88 ppm), which is an indication that the H4/H5 hydrogen atoms are shielded by the anisotropy of the cyclophane's benzene rings. Notably, the benzylic protons (exo and endo environments) show the pair of sharp doublets (\u223c5.81 and \u223c4.65 ppm), which implies that the cone conformation of 8 is rigid on the NMR timescale. Obviously, the 1H NMR spectrum of the 8 shows signals consistent with those seen in the corresponding imidazole-2-thione 4,18 while the 1H NMR spectrum of the parent imidazolium cyclophane 122+ appears broad signals because the imidazolium cyclophane is rapidly interconverted to several conformations in solution43 (Fig. 9). Presumably, the conformational ability of the imidazole-2-thione and imidazole-2-selone cyclophane structure decreased owing to an increase in bulkiness of the thione and selone groups in 4 and 8, respectively, compared to the imidazolium groups in 122+.\nThe 1H NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6 solution at room temperature) of 10 is also consistent with the cone-type conformation in the solution, as observed in the solid state. Again, the 1H NMR chemical shi of the H4/H5 protons in the imidazole-2selone ring is markedly upeld chemical shi (\u223c5.79 ppm, compared with\u223c8.02 ppm seen for H4/H5 protons in the parent imidazolium cyclophane 132+). Notably, the corresponding protons in imidazole-2-thione 6 are signicantly upeld (\u223c5.63 ppm). This upeld shi observed in 10 and 6 also indicates that the H4/H5 protons are shielded by the ring resonance of the benzene groups and, therefore, shows that the conformation in the solution is consistent with that seen in the solid state. H4/ H5 protons in 132+ show a far downeld (8.02 ppm), and this indicates that the H4/H5 protons are deshielded by the effects\n17288 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 17282\u201317296\nof the benzene groups because of cyclophane formed in the 1,3- alternate type conformation and also due to the positive charge effects in the imidazolium rings. Interestingly, the pair of sharp doublets (i.e., an AX pattern) for the benzylic protons (exo and endo environments) indicates that rapid interconversion between the two equivalent forms of this conformation does not occur in the solution. This provides additional evidence that the cone conformation is rigid in solution, as observed in the solid state. Rigidity of conformation has been shown similarly for the precursor imidazole-2-thione 6 and imidazolium-linked cyclophane 132+ (Fig. 10).18,43\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of 9 shows two sets of signals with integrals in equal ratios (Fig. 11). These signals were assigned to two conformations based on different orientations of the two imidazole-2-selone moieties: one of them has syn conformation, and the other has anti conformation. In each conformation, the benzylic protons show one pair of doublets, indicating that both conformations of 9 are rigid on the NMR timescale (i.e. the rotation of imidazole-2-selone rings about their N\u2013N axes do not occur in the solution). This result is consistent with the case for imidazole-2-thione 5 (ref. 18) and contradicts the parent imidazolium cyclophane 142+, which has conformational lability.43 The two conformations are present in nearly equal amounts in the NMR timescale, and it is not able to assign the set signals in each conformation based on splitting patterns and chemical shis. However, the crystals formed of 9 show only anti conformation based on the X-ray study (see above), while the powder formed of 9 presents as a syn conformation.\nIn both conformations of 9, the splitting patterns and chemical shis of the different proton environments are similar. Therefore, we are not able to assign a special conformation to a special set of signals in NMR. Notably, the similarity of signals in NMR shows that there is no interesting difference in shielding because of, for example, the resonance in arene rings. This interpretation is consistent with that seen in the solid state in which the arene rings are directed with their planes approximately parallel to the N\u2013N axes of the imidazole2-selone rings, so the environments of the CH2 and H4/H5\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

These considerations apply to the anti and syn conformations.\nThe 1H NMR spectra of 11 again show two sets of signals that are perhaps assigned to syn and anti conformations (Fig. 12). Obviously, both conformations are present in nearly equal amounts in the NMR timescale. Again, we are not able to assign the set signals to exact conformation based on chemical shis and splitting patterns. Interestingly, the recrystallisation of 11 provided three types of crystals (as observed in the X-ray diffraction). The yellow needle crystals can be attributed to the syn conformation, and the colorless plate crystals can be attributed to the anti conformation based on the X-ray study, while the colorless needle crystals\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nformed the other conformation attributed to the partial cone conformation. Notably, for anti and syn conformations of solutions of 11 in DMSO-d6 and in acetone-d6, arene ring protons H2\u2032/H3\u2032 should be shown as two environments. Therefore, in both cases, H2\u2032/H3\u2032 protons show one sharp single signal (even in acetone-d6 at \u221225 \u00b0C). These considerations suggest that the arene rings are rapidly rotated about their C1\u2032\u2013C4\u2032 axis on the NMR timescale (Fig. 13); therefore, a partial cone conformation does not appear in the solution, as seen in the solid state. The observed that two sets of NMR signals for syn and anti conformations indicate that the selone moieties are not rotated about their N\u2013N axes on the NMR timescale.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 17282\u201317296 | 17289\nFig. 10 Downfield region of the 1H NMR spectra (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) for solutions of (a) the ligand of imidazole-2-selone 10, (b) the ligand of imidazole-2-thione 6 and (c) its precursor imidazolium-linked cyclophane salt 13$2Br.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The other two conformations (9 and 11) have only two conformations (syn and anti) owing to their semi planar nature.\nFig. 14 shows the relative energies of the different conformations calculated using the Beck functional (BP86). The negative values indicate the energy preference of the syn geometries over the anti ones. From rst glance, one can assume that pairs 8 and 10, and 9 and 11 have the same energy trend in their conformational preferences. This assumption seems to be true for the latter geometries (9 and 11), where anti conformers tend to be marginally more stable over the syn structures in the semi planar molecules, which can explain the crystal co-existence of the two conformers. However, the above assumption is not true\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Although both the anti symmetric structures are not energetically preferred in these systems, the energy trends are contrasted when it comes to syn_in conformers. In 8 compounds, we see syn < syn_in < anti trend, and the 10 compound stability order is syn < anti < syn_in, where the syn_in is the least stable conformer. These computed gures agree with the experimental geometries for syn geometry that we isolated and reported in the experiments.\nTo shed light on the origin of the stability of the different conformers, we were inspired by Walsh's prominent orbital\u2013 structure correlation diagram.45 For that, we illustrated the four of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of both syn and anti conformers of 10 (Fig. 15). These energies contribute to a signicant share inuencing the nal total energy of the system. The Kohn\u2013Sham relative molecular orbitals were represented (eV) to facilitate the obvious contrast energy levels of the two conformers. The eigenvalues of the molecular states of the syn conformers recorded obvious stability over all the orbital energies of the anti conformers. The HOMO of the anti c destabilized the HOMO orbitals by 0.27 eV, while the HOMO-2 and HOMO-3 increase by only 0.10 eV and 0.11 eV, respectively. Similar justication can be drawn for the other conformational stabilities of the other of the structures shown in Fig. 14."

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nbase. These cyclophanes are stable white powdered compounds and were thoroughly characterized using X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Similar to the imidazole-2thione cyclophanes, the imidazole-2-selone cyclophanes with selone groups connected by o-xylylene or mesitylene-m-xylylene rings exhibit only the syn conformation, while those with selone groups connected by m-xylylene or p-xylylene rings exhibit both syn and anti conformations. Unlike the parent imidazolium cyclophanes, which are conformationally labile, the synthesized thione and selone cyclophanes are signicantly more conformationally rigid. Therefore, no interconversion between the syn and anti conformations can be detected on the NMR timescale. The geometrical analysis of various compounds was carried out by DFT calculation, and the calculations included the different possible conformations that resulted from orienting the selone groups in different directions. These calculations agree with the experimental data, which conrmed the stability of both anti and syn conformers in 9 and 11 compounds and the unique stability of syn geometries in 8 and 10."
