            "text": "1\nIntroduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has emerged as a major public health problem in industrialized countries, and its incidence is rising (1\u20133). PDAC is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States by 2030, overtaking breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer (3). Most patients present with locally advanced or widely metastatic disease, rendering these tumors surgically unresectable (1\u20133). Even patients with localized tumors amenable to surgical resection will succumb to metastatic disease in almost all cases, suggesting that metastases occur prior to clinical presentation (1). Although previous studies identified mutant KRAS and molecular alterations inactivating CDKN2A, TP53, and TGF-\u03b2 pathway components, these findings have not translated into improved therapies, nor have they led to effective screening strategies (3, 4, 5). Thus, there is a dire need to discover actionable mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for this exceptionally refractory tumor. In contrast to many solid tumors, PDACs are characterized by a dense desmoplastic stroma composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and fibrous scar tissue, although the role of the stroma in tumor progression remains controversial (6\u201311). While immune cells are found within the stroma, PDACs tend to be \u201ccold\u201d tumors, lacking an antitumor immune response (12). In vitro studies show that CAFs secrete factors that provide inflammatory signals and stimulate tumor growth and progression (9\u201311). Similarly, biomechanical analyses suggest that a \u201cstiff \u201d tumor microenvironment alters tumor cells to enhance motility and facilitate metastases (13\u201315). Further, PDAC cells grow faster when implanted with CAFs in mouse xenografts (16). The dense fibroblastic stroma also provides a barrier that prevents cytotoxic therapy from reaching tumor cells (9). Conversely, studies in transgenic mouse models of PDAC found that the stroma restrains tumor growth and progression (7, 8). More recent studies employing single-cell sequencing revealed that stromal cells, like cancer cells, are heterogeneous and impart tumor heterogeneity by creating various interfaces for tumor cells within their microenvironment (9, 17\u201323). These studies reveal a complex and nuanced role for the PDAC stroma, underscoring the need to better understand its role in disease progression.\nEpigenetic alterations have emerged as a fundamental hallmark of cancer that drive tumorigenesis by altering cell fate decisions and differentiation (24). For example, genetic lesions involv-\nHigh mobility group A1 (HMGA1) chromatin regulators are upregulated in diverse tumors where they portend adverse outcomes, although how they function in cancer remains unclear. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are highly lethal tumors characterized by dense desmoplastic stroma composed predominantly of cancer-associated fibroblasts and fibrotic tissue. Here, we uncover an epigenetic program whereby HMGA1 upregulates FGF19 during tumor progression and stroma formation. HMGA1 deficiency disrupts oncogenic properties in vitro while impairing tumor inception and progression in KPC mice and subcutaneous or orthotopic models of PDAC. RNA sequencing revealed HMGA1 transcriptional networks governing proliferation and tumor-stroma interactions, including the FGF19 gene. HMGA1 directly induces FGF19 expression and increases its protein secretion by recruiting active histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K27Ac). Surprisingly, disrupting FGF19 via gene silencing or the FGFR4 inhibitor BLU9931 recapitulates most phenotypes observed with HMGA1 deficiency, decreasing tumor growth and formation of a desmoplastic stroma in mouse models of PDAC. In human PDAC, overexpression of HMGA1 and FGF19 defines a subset of tumors with extremely poor outcomes. Our results reveal what we believe is a new paradigm whereby HMGA1 and FGF19 drive tumor progression and stroma formation, thus illuminating FGF19 as a rational therapeutic target for a molecularly defined PDAC subtype.\nHMGA1 induces FGF19 to drive pancreatic carcinogenesis and stroma formation"

In intestinal stem cells, HMGA1 amplifies Wnt signals from the stroma and epithelial niches by inducing the expression of genes encoding Wnt agonist receptors (Fzd5/7, Lrp5/6, and Lgr5) and Wnt effectors, such as cMyc and Sox9 (46). Together, these findings suggest that HMGA1 fosters tumor progression through both cell-intrinsic and stromal interactions, though little is known about transcriptional networks and tumor-stroma crosstalk governed by HMGA1 in PDAC.\nHere, we uncover what we believe is a previously unknown epigenetic program whereby HMGA1 upregulates transcriptional networks involved in proliferation and tumor-stroma interactions during tumor progression and development of a fibroblastic stroma in PDAC. HMGA1 binds directly to the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) promoter and recruits active histone marks to induce FGF19 expression and secretion from PDAC cells. Silencing either HMGA1 or FGF19 disrupts phenotypes required for tumor progression. Surprisingly, loss of just a single Hmga1 allele within the pancreatic ductal epithelium significantly prolongs survival in Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+LSL-R172H; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) (63) mice compared with those with both Hmga1 alleles intact. In mice with human PDAC xenografts, silencing HMGA1 or FGF19 depletes tumor-initiating cells while disrupting tumor growth and stroma formation. Moreover, treatment with an FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) inhibitor, BLU9931, to block FGF19 function (64) recapitulates the effects of HMGA1 or FGF19 silencing, decreasing tumor growth and stroma formation in orthotopic models. Importantly, high expression of both HMGA1 and FGF19 defines a subclass of human PDAC with exceptionally poor outcomes. Together, our findings reveal a unique role for HMGA1 in tumor progression and \u201cbuilding\u201d a stromal wall through FGF19 and highlight a new therapeutic target for a subset of highly recalcitrant tumors.\nResults Silencing HMGA1 disrupts oncogenic properties and depletes tumor-initiating cells. Because HMGA1 is upregulated in PDACs where high levels associate with decreased survival (36, 38, 61, 62), we sought to elucidate HMGA1 function in pancreatic carcinogenesis. First, we found that HMGA1 expression (mRNA and protein) is higher in PDAC cell lines derived from metastatic tumors compared with those from primary tumors (65) (Supplemental Figure 1, A\u2013E; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI151601DS1). Next, we silenced HMGA1 via lentiviral delivery of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting 2 different sequences (49) in cell lines from primary and metastatic tumors harboring common PDAC mutations: (a) E3LZ10.7 (66), from a liver metastasis with KRASG12D and homozygous SMAD4 deletion; (b) MIA PaCa-2 (67), from a primary PDAC with homozygous CDKN2A/p16INK4A deletion, mutant KRASG12C, and TP53; and (c) AsPC-1 (67), from PDAC ascites fluid with homozygous mutations in KRASG12D, TP53C135fs*35, and CDKN2AL78fs*41. Strikingly, HMGA1 deficiency disrupted proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, invasion, and 3-dimensional (3D) sphere formation in all cell lines tested (Figure 1), indicating that HMGA1 is required for these oncogenic properties.\ning the switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) nucleosome remodeling complex occur in up to 15% of PDAC (25). Mutations affecting histone methyltransferase genes (mixed-lineage leukemia 2 and 3) and the gene encoding the histone demethylase lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A), also arise in PDAC (25). Accordingly, aberrant methylation patterns are characteristic of PDAC (26\u201328). Genetic alterations that decrease sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) protein levels, a nutrient sensor and histone deacetylase that removes acetyl groups from histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and histone 3 lysine 56 (H3K56), drive pancreatic tumorigenesis in murine models and predict a subclass of human PDAC with decreased survival (29). Although these discoveries shed light on epigenetic abnormalities in PDAC, they have not led to better therapies.\nOverexpression of the gene encoding the chromatin regulator HMGA1 occurs in most aggressive tumors, including PDAC, where high levels portend poor differentiation and adverse outcomes (30\u201350). The HMGA1 gene is normally expressed during embryogenesis (30, 39, 51) and in adult stem cells (46, 49, 52), but silenced postnatally in most differentiated cells. Through alternatively spliced mRNA, HMGA1 encodes HMGA1a and HMGA1b isoforms, which bind to AT-rich sequences, bend chromatin, and recruit transcriptional complexes to modulate gene expression (31\u201335, 37, 39, 42, 45\u201347, 49, 53). When overexpressed in lymphoid cells of transgenic mice, Hmga1 induces aggressive leukemia by upregulating transcriptional networks active in proliferating stem cells, poorly differentiated cancer cells, and inflammation (32, 35, 43, 47, 53). While mechanisms driving HMGA1 expression in cancer are incompletely understood, growth factors (54, 55), cancerassociated mutations, including Kras (56) or mutant Apc (57), and oncogenic transcription factors, such as cMYC (58\u201360), upregulate HMGA1, suggesting that diverse oncogenic pathways converge on HMGA1 to induce its expression. HMGA1 also cooperates with\nFigure 1. HMGA1 knockdown disrupts oncogenic properties in PDAC cell lines.

Given this robust upregulation and because growth factors can function in cell-autonomous and tumor-stroma interactions, we focused on FGF19 first. In other contexts, FGF19 promotes proliferation, and Fgf15, the murine homolog, induces hepatocellular carcinogenesis and fibrosis in mice (71\u201374). Further, clinical inhibitors are available to target FGF19 or its receptor, FGFR4 (64, 75\u201377), although the role of FGF19 in pancreatic carcinogenesis is unknown.\nHMGA1 induces FGF19 expression and secretion. HMGA1dependent expression of FGF19 (mRNA, protein) was validated in PDAC cell lines (E3LZ10.7, MIA PaCa-2, and AsPC-1; Figure 3, D and E). Intriguingly, FGF19 levels were much higher in the metastatic cell lines (E3LZ10.7 and AsPC-1) compared with MIA PaCa-2 cells derived from a localized tumor (Supplemental Figure 2B). Because FGF19 protein was barely detectable in MIA PaCa-2 cells, we validated its HMGA1 dependence by immunoprecipitation (IP) (Supplemental Figure 2C). Because FGF19 is secreted from cells and could function in an autocrine and/ or paracrine fashion, we assessed secretion from E3LZ10.7 cells by cytokine arrays, which show a marked decrease with HMGA1 silencing (Figure 3, F and G); these results were validated by immunoblotting and ELISA of media (Figure 3, Hand I). Six additional secreted factors were repressed with HMGA1 silencing, 7 were increased, and 9 were unchanged (Supplemental Figure 2, D\u2013F). Similar to the gene expression results, secreted FGF19 was among the most robustly repressed factors with HMGA1 deficiency. FGF19 secretion from AsPC-1 or MIA-PaCa-2 cells also decreased with HMGA1 silencing, as detected by ELISA of media\nTo define HMGA1 function in vivo, we assessed xenograft tumorigenesis from PDAC cell lines (E3LZ10.7 and AsPC-1), which showed that HMGA1 deficiency decreases tumor volumes (Figure 2, A and B). Intriguingly, tumors that formed from the pool of cells with HMGA1 silencing (E3LZ10.7 and AsPC-1 cells) express higher HMGA1 than the injected cells, suggesting that escape from gene silencing and a specific level of HMGA1 is required for tumor formation (Supplemental Figure 1, F and G). HMGA1 deficiency also depletes tumor-initiating cells in both cell lines (E3LZ10.7 and AsPC-1), demonstrating that HMGA1 is required for tumor initiation and growth in xenograft models (Figure 2C and Supplemental Figure 1, H and I).\nHMGA1 regulates transcriptional networks involved in proliferation and signaling. To identify HMGA1 transcriptional networks, we performed RNA sequencing (GSE222890) in E3LZ10.7 cells (Figure 3, A and B) with or without HMGA1 silencing. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated cells with high HMGA1 (controls) from those with HMGA1 silencing (Supplemental Figure 2A). Differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05, log2[fold change] > 1.5) (68) included 660 up- and 565 downregulated genes (Figure 3B). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA, MSigDb Hallmark gene sets) revealed an HMGA1 signature of genes involved in cell cycle progression (E2F targets, G2/M checkpoint, mitotic spindle genes) (Figure 3C), while curated gene sets showed enrichment for cell cycle progression, cell signaling, metastatic progression, cancer stem cells, and embryonic stem cells (Supplemental Table 1) (69, 70). Unexpectedly, we identified gene sets associated with bile acid metabolism, a pathway regulated, in part, by FGF19. Intriguingly, FGF19 (Figure 3B) was among the genes most robust-\n5J Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI151601\nJ Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI1516016\n(Figure 3I and Supplemental Figure 2G). Together, these results demonstrate that FGF19 gene expression, protein levels within PDAC cells, and secretion depend upon HMGA1 in E3LZ10.7, MIA PaCa-2, and AsPC-1 cell lines.\nSilencing FGF19 recapitulates effects of silencing HMGA1. To determine whether FGF19 is required for HMGA1 function in PDAC, we silenced FGF19 in PDAC cell lines (E3LZ10.7, MIA PaCa-2, and AsPC-1) via lentiviral delivery of shRNAs targeting 2 different sequences (Figure 4, A and B, and Supplemental Figure 3A). Surprisingly, silencing FGF19 faithfully recapitulated phenotypes observed with HMGA1 deficiency, disrupting proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and 3D sphere formation (Figure 4, C\u2013I). As an alternative approach to inhibit FGF19, we tested BLU9931, an inhibitor that specifically blocks the canonical FGF19 receptor (FGFR4) (64), demonstrating that BLU9931 impairs the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of PDAC cell lines (E3LZ10.7 and MIA PaCa-2; Supplemental Figure 3, B\u2013D). In xenograft tumorigenesis with E3LZ10.7 and AsPC-1 cells, both of which express higher levels of FGF19, the knockdown of FGF19 decreased tumor volumes and tumor-initiating cells (Figure 5, A\u2013C, and Supplemental Figure 3, E and F). Intriguingly, in FGF19-silenced tumors, one E3LZ10.7 tumor at each dilution and one AsPC-1 tumor at the lowest dilution grew to proportions equal to or greater than controls. We therefore reassessed FGF19 levels in these tumors and noted a marked increase in FGF19 relative to the injected pool, suggesting that escape from FGF19 silencing allowed enhanced tumor growth (Supplemental Figure 3, G and H).\nTo determine whether exogenous FGF19 could rescue the effects of HMGA1 silencing, we exposed PDAC cells with HMGA1 silencing (E3LZ10.7) to recombinant human FGF19 (hFGF19). Proliferation (via 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine [EdU] incorporation)\nincreased upon treatment with hFGF19, but not to levels of the control cells (Supplemental Figure 3I), indicating that FGF19 is required, but not sufficient, for proliferation mediated by HMGA1. Together, our results indicate that FGF19 is a partial mediator of HMGA1 oncogenic function in these PDAC models.\nHMGA1 binds directly to the FGF19 promoter and recruits activating histone marks. Using an in silico prediction algorithm (MatInspector) (78), we identified putative HMGA1 DNA binding sites within the FGF19 promoter at \u20131092, \u2013832, and \u2013810 base pairs (designated sites A, B, and C, respectively) upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (Figure 6A). HMGA1 occupancy by chromatin IP\u2013PCR (ChIP-PCR) demonstrated that regions (~200 base pairs) surrounding site A (region 1, R1) or the region encompassing sites B and C (R2) show enrichment for HMGA in cell lines (E3LZ10.7, MIA PaCa-2, and AsPC-1), which was depleted with HMGA1 knockdown (Figure 6, B\u2013D). The positive control, histone H3, was unchanged with HMGA1 deficiency. By contrast, there was no significant occupancy, nor were there changes with HMGA1 deficiency using a negative control IgG antibody (Figure 6E).\nBecause our gene expression data show that HMGA1 induces FGF19, we assessed occupancy of active histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac), both of which mark promoter and enhancer regions. In 3 cell lines (E3LZ10.7, MIA PaCa-2, and AsPC-1), H3K4me3 was abundant at R1 and R2 and decreased with HMGA1 silencing (Figure 6, E\u2013G). HMGA1 deficiency also depleted H3K4me3 at R1 in AsPC-1 cells (Figure 6G). These data indicate that HMGA1 binds directly to the FGF19 promoter at R1 and R2 and recruits H3K4me3 in all 3 PDAC cell lines. In the metastatic E3LZ10.7 and AsPC-1 cell lines, HMGA1 also recruited H3K27Ac to R2. Of note, H3K27Ac histone marks associate with poised chromatin, stretch, or \u201csuper-enhancers,\u201d and regulation of developmental or stem cell\u2013like genes during normal development and in cancer (79). Poised enhancers at developmental promoters are also implicated in poorly differentiated cancers and cancer stem cells (80). Although there are differences in the specific histone marks between cell lines, HMGA1 was consistently associated with occupancy of active histone marks at the FGF19 promoter in all 3 cell lines.\nTo functionally validate these chromatin marks, we determined whether HMGA1 transactivates the FGF19 promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene. We tested a promoter construct (\u20131144) including regions R1, R2, and downstream sequences up to the TSS compared with constructs with 5\u2032 deletions: (a) \u20131046, lacking R1 and site A; (b) \u2013816, lacking R1, site A, 5\u2032 sequences of R2, and site B; and (c) \u2013756, lacking R1, R2, and sites A, B, and C. As expected, the \u20131144 construct showed the greatest reporter activation, with decreases in constructs \u2013816 and \u2013756, and the lowest activity in the construct lacking both R1 and R2 (Figure 7A). Promoter activity of the full-length construct also decreases to levels of the deletion constructs in the presence of either a dominant-negative HMGA1 that no longer binds to DNA (81) or with HMGA1 silencing (Figure 7, B and C). These findings indicate that HMGA1 directly transactivates FGF19 expression by binding to R1 and R2 and recruiting active histone marks.\nHMGA1 signals through FGF19/FGFR4. To determine whether HMGA1 and FGF19 signal through FGFR4, we assessed phos-\nFigure 3. HMGA1 induces FGF19 expression and secretion in PDAC cell lines.

Of note, tumors arising from cells with HMGA1 knockdown included a subset of tumor cells with HMGA1 intranuclear staining resembling controls, consistent with our gene expression data suggesting that escape from HMGA1 silencing allows tumor cells to grow as xenografts (Supplemental Figure 1, F and G). Further, the proliferation marker Ki-67 decreased with HMGA1 or FGF19 silencing in PDAC xenografts (Figure 9, A and C, and Supplemental Figure 5, A and C). These findings indicate that HMGA1 and FGF19 promote tumor proliferation and stroma formation in xenografted tumors.\nTo elucidate HMGA1-dependent changes in CAF composition within the stroma of xenografted tumors, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) to classify CAFs into 3 major subtypes previously defined in KPC mice and human tumors (19\u201323) based on positive staining for podoplanin (PDPN; a pan-CAF marker) and (a) \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA); (b) CD74, a transmembrane molecule involved in formation and transport of major histocompatibility (MCH) class II peptides; and (c) IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine. In PDAC xenografts from all 3 cell lines, \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs comprised the majority, with less contribution from CD74+ and IL-6+ CAFs. Silencing HMGA1 or FGF19 reduced the proportion of all 3 CAF subtypes (Figure 9, D and E, and Supplemental Figure 5, D and E). Together, these findings indicate that HMGA1 and FGF19 modulate CAF composition to induce the formation of a desmoplastic stroma in xenografted tumors.\nHmga1 deficiency in KPC mice impairs tumor and stroma formation. To investigate Hmga1 in tumorigenesis, CAF composition, and stroma formation in mice with a competent immune system, we crossed KPC mice, in which PDAC develops more gradually (63), with mice with global deficiency of one or both Hmga1 alleles (all on C57BL/6 backgrounds) and followed offspring for evidence of PDAC (abdominal distension, rectal prolapse, palpable tumors) or ill appearance (hunching, or decreased activity, oral intake, or weight; Table 1). Similar to prior reports (63), KPC mice (24 of 24 evaluable mice) developed pancreatic tumors by 14.1 weeks [median survival time]) (Supplemental Figure 6A). Tissue autolysis precluded further analyses in 2 mice that died at 8 and 16 weeks. A subset of KPC mice developed rectal prolapse (5 of 24) and/or ascites (3 of 24) (Table 1). In all cases, invasive pancreatic tumors developed (24 of 24) with pathology consistent with PDAC in most (92%; 22 of 24); 2 developed an undifferentiated sarcomatoid pancreatic tumor. By contrast, KPC mice with Hmga1 heterozygosity had delayed tumorigenesis and prolonged survival (n = 9; median survival 17.0 weeks). One KPC/Hmga1 heterozygous mouse developed a large salivary gland tumor at 7.4 weeks of age; the pancreas showed only rare foci of acinar ductal metaplasia. Of note, Hmga1 heterozygous mice have normal life expectancy with no evidence of abnormal growth or development (48, 49). We also generated 1 KPC mouse null for Hmga1, which had a normal pancreas size and only rare foci of acinar ductal metaplasia at 22 weeks; it was sacrificed prior to any evidence of illness. Hmga1-knockout mice have decreased embryonic viability, whereas those that survive development are slightly small but appear grossly normal up to 30 weeks of age when they develop signs of premature aging (graying, osteopenia, decreased gait velocity) (49). We used ultrasound to confirm the presence of pancreatic tumors in a subset of mice (Supplemental Figure 6B). phorylation of FGFR4 and downstream signals (ERK and AKT) by flow cytometry and Western blotting in PDAC cells (E3LZ10.7 and AsPC-1). Silencing either HMGA1 or FGF19 decreased phosphorylation of FGFR4 (p-FGFR4; by flow cytometry) and downstream signaling molecules (ERK and AKT) without affecting unphosphorylated protein levels, indicating that both HMGA1 and FGF19 transduce signals through canonical FGF19/FGFR4 pathways (Figure 8, A\u2013F). After rendering cells (E3LZ10.7, MIA-PaCa-2, and AsPC-1) quiescent by serum deprivation, FGFR4 phosphorylation and proliferation increased with exposure to recombinant hFGF19 (Supplemental Figure 4, A\u2013F). Together, these results suggest that HMGA1 induces FGF19 expression and protein secretion, resulting in the phosphorylation of FGFR4 and downstream signaling molecules to enhance proliferation in PDAC cells. HMGA1 and FGF19 associate with fibrotic stroma formation. Because secreted FGF19 could interact with stroma, we determined whether HMGA1 or FGF19 modulates fibrosis (via trichrome staining) and CAF composition within the stroma. Fibrosis scores were assigned based on area staining with trichrome: 0 (<5%), 1 (5%\u201330%), 2 (30%\u201360%), and 3 (>60%). In control PDAC xenografts, extensive fibrosis comprised over 30%\u201360% of tumor volumes (fibrosis scores 2\u20133) and included both stromal cells with a characteristic fibroblast appearance (Figure 9, A and B, and Supplemental Figure 5, A and B) and tumor cells with extensive intranuclear HMGA1 staining and cytoplasmic FGF19 staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 9A and Supplemental Figure 5A). In contrast, xenografts from PDAC cells with HMGA1 or FGF19 silencing had less fibrosis (<30% area; Figure 9, A and B, and Supplemental Figure 5, A and B). Both HMGA1 and FGF19 staining also decreased in tumors from PDAC cells with HMGA1 silencing and FGF19 silencing also decreased FGF19\nFigure 4.

Accordingly, HMGA1 IHC in KPC/Hmga1fl/+ or KPC/Hmga1fl/fl mice showed a decrease or absence of HMGA1 in tumors cells, respectively, and FGF15 staining also decreased in parallel with HMGA1 (Figure 10B). Moreover, fibrosis scores and Ki-67 decreased in KPC mice with Hmga1 deficiency within pancreatic epithelium (Figure 10, B\u2013D). Further, all 3 major CAF subtypes (by IF) decreased with pancreatic epithelial Hmga1 deficiency (Figure 10, E and F). Together, these striking results demonstrate that the loss of just a single Hmga1 allele within the pancreatic ductal epithelium is sufficient to mitigate tumorigenesis, stroma formation, and modulate CAF composition, thereby prolonging survival in KPC mice.\nHMGA1 and FGF19 are upregulated in human PDAC with exceptionally poor outcomes. To determine whether HMGA1 and FGF19 are relevant in human PDAC, we queried published data sets (GSE15471; n = 36 nonmalignant tissue, n = 36 tumor samples) (82). As expected, HMGA1 was robustly upregulated in most human PDACs, consistent with prior studies (Figure 11A) (36, 38). By contrast, FGF19 was variable, with tumors demonstrating low, moderate, or high expression (Figure 11A). However, HMGA1 and FGF19 correlated positively in all tumors, albeit weakly (Figure 11B). In another independent data set (GSE16515) (83), we validated similar patterns with consistent HMGA1 overexpression and a broader range of FGF19 expression (Supplemental Figure 7D). Since HMGA1 is overexpressed in most tumors, whereas FGF19 is upregulated in only a subset (~25%), we determined whether high expression of both HMGA1 and FGF19 predicts outcomes. In a PDAC database with survival data (GSE21501; n = 102 PDAC tumors) (84), we categorized PDAC tumors (n = 102) by quartiles\nTo ascertain whether Hmga1 deficiency alters pancreatic stroma development and fibrosis in KPC mice, we validated HMGA1 deficiency (via IHC), which showed robust HMGA1 intranuclear staining in KPC mice, less staining in KPC mice with Hmga1 heterozygosity, and complete absence of HMGA1 in KPC/ Hmga1-knockout mice (Supplemental Figure 6C). FGF19 staining paralleled results observed with HMGA1, with robust FGF15 staining in KPC mice, moderate staining in KPC/Hmga1 heterozygous mice, and low levels in the KPC pancreas with Hmga1 knockout (Supplemental Figure 6C). Similarly, fibrosis scores decreased in KPC mice with a deficiency of one Hmga1 allele (Supplemental Figure 6, C and D, and Table 1), while the Hmga1-knockout mouse did not develop PDAC or fibrosis by 22 weeks. These data demonstrate that HMGA1 is required for pancreatic tumorigenesis and stromal formation in KPC mice.\nHmga1 haploinsufficiency within pancreatic ductal epithelium is sufficient to mitigate tumor and stroma formation in KPC mice. To determine whether Hmga1 deficiency within the pancreatic ductal epithelium is sufficient to mitigate tumorigenesis and stroma formation, we generated KPC mice crossed with mice with one or both Hmga1 alleles floxed, resulting in deletion of floxed alleles within pancreatic epithelium, including KPC mice with pancreas-specific heterozygous (KPC/Hmga1fl/+) or homozygous (KPC/Hmga1fl/fl) deletions. Surprisingly, loss of just a single Hmga1 allele within the pancreas (KPC/Hmga1fl/+) was sufficient to delay tumorigenesis and prolong survival (n = 5; 22.3 weeks) in KPC mice, and survival was prolonged even more than what we observed for KPC mice with global Hmga1 heterozygous deficiency (Figure 10A). Survival was also prolonged in mice with pancreas-specific deletion of both Hmga1 alleles (n = 7; KPC/Hmga1fl/fl; 22.0 weeks) similar to the\nJ Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI1516011 0\ncating that this pathway is relevant to human PDAC and further underscoring FGF19 as a plausible therapeutic target for this highly recalcitrant molecular subtype (Figure 11C).\nBLU9931 decreases tumorigenesis and stroma formation in orthotopic PDAC models. Because our primary goal is to identify actionable mechanisms in PDAC, we determined whether targeting the HMGA1/FGF19 pathway with BLU9931 mitigates tumor and stroma formation. We tested BLU9931 at doses established to reach based on relative expression of both genes, with the upper quartile representing tumors with highest expression of HMGA1 and FGF19 (red line; n = 26) and the lower quartile representing tumors with lowest expression of HMGA1 and FGF19 (black line; n = 26). We included a quartile with high HMGA1 and low FGF19 (green line; n = 25) and relatively low HMGA1 with high FGF19 (blue line; n = 25) (Figure 11C). Strikingly, tumors with high levels of both HMGA1 and FGF19 had worse overall survival (P = 0.005), indi-\n1 1J Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI151601\nall CAF subtypes decreased (Figure 13, E and F). Recipients of KPC implants with Hmga1 heterozygous deficiency had slightly smaller tumors than KPC mice treated with BLU9931. Although BLU9931 resulted in slightly lower mean tumor volumes in KPC/Hmga1 heterozygous implants in addition to decreased HMGA1, FGF15, and Ki-67 staining, and 2 of 3 CAF subtypes, the changes were modest, as tumor growth was markedly diminished by Hmga1 haploinsufficiency alone (Supplemental Figure 8, A\u2013E). Taken together, these results indicate that HMGA1 drives PDAC tumor initiation, progression, and stroma formation, at least in part, by inducing FGF19 expression and secretion. Moreover, this pathway can be disrupted with an FGFR4 inhibitor, BLU9931. Most importantly, overexpression of HMGA1 and FGF19 defines a subset of human PDAC with exceptionally poor outcomes, underscoring the need for further studies to assess targeting FGF19 in PDAC.\nDiscussion Alterations in chromatin regulators frequently occur in cancer, although most epigenetic modulators have eluded therapeutic targeting (85\u201387). For example, genes encoding chromatin regulators involved in pluripotency, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, NANOG, and LIN28, are rarely mutated, but frequently overexpressed in cancer, thus rendering pharmacologic interventions challenging (87). Such factors are believed to reprogram the epigenome to a more plastic, stem-like state, thereby endowing tumor cells with the capacity to proliferate in a deregulated fashion, circumvent differentiation cues, evade therapy, and metastasize. HMGA1 chromatin regulators are oncofetal proteins that enhance cellular reprogramming by upregulating pluripotency networks (47, 88, 89). Similar to pluripotency factors, HMGA1 is rarely mutated, but almost universally overexpressed in aggressive cancers, consistent with a fundamental role in tumorigenesis (47, 88). Indeed, HMGA1 is among the most abundant, nonhistone chromatin-binding proteins with-\npharmacologic levels in mice (64) in human PDAC xenografts from E2LZ10.7 cells (1 \u00d7 106) injected into the midpancreas of immunosuppressed mice (NOD Scid \u03b3, NSG). Once tumors reached a volume of 100\u2013200 mm3 by ultrasound, mice were given BLU9931 twice daily by oral gavage (300 mg/kg or vehicle control) approximately 1 week following implantation. Mice underwent necropsy after 4 weeks of therapy when controls began to appear ill. Strikingly, there was a marked decrease in tumor volumes in mice treated with BLU9931, along with decreased staining for HMGA1, FGF19, Ki-67, and fibrosis (trichrome) (Figure 12, A\u2013D). The 3 CAF subtypes also decreased with BLU9931 (Figure 12, E and F), suggesting that targeting FGFR4 with BLU9931 is a promising approach for human PDAC overexpressing HMGA1 and FGF19.\nNext, we tested BLU9931 in syngeneic mice with an intact immune system and KPC orthotopic implants. After generating subcutaneous xenografts from KPC and KPC/Hmga1fl/+ heterozygous cell lines with tumor volumes of approximately 100\u2013200 mm3, tumor fragments were implanted surgically into the pancreas of mice. One week after implantation, we confirmed tumor formation (volumes of 100\u2013200 mm3) by ultrasound, after which mice were divided into treatment arms with similar tumor volume distributions (n = 8\u201310/group): (a) KPC implants, BLU9931 treatment (twice daily oral gavage); b) KPC implants, vehicle control (twice daily oral gavage); c) KPC-Hmga1 heterozygous implants, BLU9931 treatment; and (d) KPC-Hmga1 heterozygous implants, vehicle control. Mice were followed by weekly ultrasounds and necropsies performed when recipients of KPC implants treated with vehicle control appeared ill (after 4 weeks). We discovered a marked decrease in tumor volume in recipients of KPC implants treated with BLU9931 compared with vehicle control (Figure 13A). Further, KPC implant recipients treated with BLU9931 had decreased levels of HMGA1, FGF19, fibrosis, and Ki-67 (Figure 13, B\u2013D). Similar to KPC mice with Hmga1 deficiency, the frequency of\nJ Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI1516011 2\n1 3J Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI151601\nthat could be targeted in therapy remained elusive until now. We identified a single growth factor, FGF19, that fosters not only oncogenic properties, but also signals within the microenvironment to induce fibrotic desmoplasia. This mechanism is potenin nuclei of cancer cells where it induces genes expressed in stem cells and tumor progression (30, 38, 46, 48, 88, 89).

Although the reason for this is unknown, inflammatory signals may vary in different mouse colonies from factors such as the microbiome. Despite these differences, however, tumors formed within a time frame similar to those of published studies with KPC mice. Together, our work reveals a therapeutic target relevant to a newly defined molecular subclass of human PDAC characterized by high expression of HMGA1 and FGF19. Indeed, gene expression and survival data indicate that such tumors are among the most rapidly lethal PDACs.\nFGF19 is a pleiotropic, hormone-like protein that regulates lipid, carbohydrate, and bile acid metabolism through the receptor FGFR4 (72). Released from the ilium into enterohepatic circulation after exposure to bile salts in postprandial states, FGF19 dampens further bile acid release (72). FGF19 is also expressed in embryonic stem cells (91). In mice, FGF15 is required for embryogenesis and liver regeneration (92), and FGF15 induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when overexpressed in skeletal muscle, presumably through paracrine effects (71). FGF19 is also overexpressed in human HCC harboring amplifications involving the FGF19 locus (chromosome 11q13) (93), which led to the development of clinical inhibitors (64, 75\u201377). A recent study in HCC, however, showed only modest responses to an FGFR4 inhibitor (75), although chemically induced HCC in mice with Fgf15 deficiency show less fibrosis (74), suggesting that FGF15 fosters fibrosis in HCC. HMGA1 is also upregulated in human HCC (94, 95), and FGF19 is overexpressed or amplified in other tumors with HMGA1 overexpression (77). In a PDAC cell line, GLI/ERK signaling upregulates FGF19 and xenograft tumorigenesis (96), and our GSEA analyses link HMGA1 to ERK networks (Supplemental Table 1), consistent with HMGA1 as a central hub through which multiple oncogenic pathways converge. In PDAC models, FGF19 promotes tumor growth and stroma formation. Moreover, KPC mice with loss of a single Hmga1 allele within pancreatic ductal epithelium exhibit increased tumor latency, less fibrosis, and decreased FGF15 immunoreactivity, further supporting a collaborative role for HMGA1 and FGF15 in tumorigenesis and fibrotic desmoplasia (Figure 10, B and C).\nIn human PDAC, FGF19 expression is more variable than HMGA1, the latter of which is upregulated in most tumors (36,\ntially unique because it involves both tumor cell\u2013intrinsic and microenvironmental interactions that collaborate during tumor progression. Intriguingly, we recently found that HMGA1 causes bone marrow fibrosis during progression in mouse models of chronic myeloid malignancies (JAK2V617F myeloproliferative neoplasms), suggesting that fibrosis mediated by HMGA1 is relevant to diverse tumors (49). Importantly, HMGA1 also regulates transcriptional networks involved in cell cycle progression (E2F targets, G2/M checkpoint, mitotic spindle) in myeloid malignancies, although FGF19 and bile acid metabolic genes are unique to PDAC cells. Surprisingly, silencing FGF19 recapitulates most, but not all, phenotypes associated with HMGA1 silencing, suggesting that it is an important transcriptional target, although other HMGA1 transcriptional networks clearly contribute to PDAC carcinogenesis in our models.\nPrior studies revealed mutations and epigenetic alterations that arise early in pancreatic carcinogenesis, although this has not impacted therapies (3). Less is known about later mechanisms driving progression. Clonal evolution studies suggest that PDACs evolve over many years, or even decades, which could foster clonal diversity and facilitate tumor progression (90). Another vexing characteristic of PDAC is the desmoplastic stroma composed of fibrotic scar tissue and CAFs, which also exhibit heterogeneity (9, 10). Although studies of CAF signaling and biophysical properties of stroma suggest that desmoplasia fuels tumor progression, the stroma restrains tumor growth in KPC models (7, 8). These studies, together with our results, suggest that the stroma has multiple functions, which may depend on tumor stage and properties of tumor cells, and stromal composition. The stroma could provide an initial barrier that is circumvented as tumor cells become more plastic (18). While we could not dissect the contribution of the stroma in isolation, our models suggest that HMGA1 and FGF19 collaborate to promote tumor progression and stroma formation. Because HMGA1 proteins are detectable only in late-stage precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia [PanIN] 3) or invasive tumors, this mechanism may be relevant later in carcinogenesis when tumor cells invade and metastasize (38). Of note, we found lower frequencies of IL-6+ CAFs in KPC mice compared with other stud-\n1 7J Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI151601\nJ Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI1516011 8\n1 9J Clin Invest. 2023;133(6):e151601 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI151601\nMethods Detailed methods, statistical analyses, and reagents are provided in the supplemental material, including culture medium, primers, and antibodies (Supplemental Tables 2\u20134).

Why FGF19 is induced in only a fraction of tumors remains unclear. Pancreatic carcinogenesis may proceed through stepwise accumulation of mutations, or chromothripsis, whereby thousands of clustered chromosomal rearrangements occur simultaneously (3, 97). The complex genome likely contributes to PDAC heterogeneity, and some genetic alterations may affect FGF19 expression. Notably, FGF19 only partially restores proliferation in cells with HMGA1 silencing, indicating that other HMGA1 pathways foster tumorigenesis. Our transcriptomes reveal multiple HMGA1 pathways and further investigation could reveal other actionable mechanisms. However, FGF19 deficiency recapitulates most effects of HMGA1 silencing and our KPC studies are consistent with FGF15 as a downstream HMGA1 effector. Despite the circumscribed population of human tumors with both HMGA1 and FGF19 overexpression, these data delineate a molecular subclass with worse outcomes that could be targeted in therapy (98).\nKRAS-driven tumors, and PDAC in particular, have proven formidable therapeutic challenges. Therapies that target KRAS are emerging, although their efficacy in PDAC is unknown (99, 100). While inhibitors of chromatin regulators, such as bromodomain proteins, show efficacy, successes in PDAC are lacking (101). Growth factors provide attractive targets because they can be neutralized by antibodies or receptor blockade. Our work illuminates HMGA1 and FGF19 as key players in PDAC tumorigenesis and stroma formation. Most importantly, this pathway is conserved in a subset of human tumors with exceptionally poor outcomes. Together, we discovered what we believe is a previously undescribed paradigm whereby tumor cells collaborate via HMGA1 and FGF19 to drive progression, thus illuminating FGF19 as a rational therapeutic target for a molecular subclass composed of the most aggressive human PDACs.\n1.
