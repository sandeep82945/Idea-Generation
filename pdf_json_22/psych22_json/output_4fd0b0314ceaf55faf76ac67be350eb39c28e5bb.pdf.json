            "text": "Mental fatigue, defined as a psychobiological state that can be caused by engaging in demanding cognitive activity for a prolonged period, is characterized by subjective feelings of tiredness and lack of energy (Marcora et al.,\u00a02009). Moreover, it is widely recognized that a state of mental fatigue induced by a cognitive task can impact subsequent endurance exercise performance (for reviews see Brown et al.,\u00a02020; Giboin et al., 2019; Van Cutsem et al.,\u00a02017). Importantly, meta- analyses have revealed small- tomedium negative effects of performing cognitive tasks on subsequent physical performance (Brown et al.,\u00a02020; Giboin et al., 2019). It should be conceded that some studies, albeit a relatively small proportion, have failed to detect effect of mental fatigue on performance. This has occurred for both isometric (Murtagh & Todd,\u00a02004) and whole- body endurance exercises (Roussey et al.,\u00a0 2018). Additionally, there is evidence that higher levels of motivation can overcome the negative effects of mental fatigue on both cognitive and physical performance (M\u00fcller & Apps,\u00a02019).\nIn a seminal study, Marcora et al.\u00a0 (2009) examined the effects of mental fatigue\u2014 induced by a 90- min AX Continuous Performance Test, which involves multiple executive functions, including attention, error monitoring, memory, and response inhibition\u2014 on a subsequent submaximal cycling time to exhaustion test Participants stopped cycling approximately 2- min earlier when in a state of mental fatigue compared to control, which equated to a 15% reduction in time to exhaustion. This performance deficit was independent of cardiorespiratory activity, with no group differences in exercise- induced heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, and blood lactate. Notably, the mentally fatigued participants started cycling at a higher rating of perceived exertion. Perceived exertion increased at a similar rate during exercise in both groups, and, therefore, the maximal tolerable exertion (and stopping point) was reached sooner by the mentally fatigued participants compared to controls. This finding was replicated by MacMahon et al.\u00a0 (2014) who showed that a 90- min AX Continuous Performance Test impaired a subsequent 3- km running time trial. Running times were 2% slower in mentally fatigued participants compared to controls, with no group differences in heart rate, blood lactate, pacing, attention, and perceived exertion.\nHigh- intensity exercise is unpleasant and exerciseinduced interoceptive signals cue the exerciser to stop and thereby end the discomfort and pain (e.g., Jameson & Ring,\u00a02000). Importantly, the decision to stop exercising is attributable to mental rather than physical factors. With this in mind, researchers (Marcora & Staiano, 2010) have\nspeculated that shorter exercise times following mentally fatiguing cognitive tasks may be due to impaired ability to inhibit responses, such as ignoring signals cuing the exerciser to stop. To evaluate the role of response inhibition processes during a mentally fatiguing cognitive task, Pageaux et al.\u00a0 (2014) examined 5- km running time trial performance after completing 30- min incongruent Stroop and congruent Stroop tasks. Both tasks require attention and memory, however, only the incongruent task requires response inhibition (i.e., to stop reading the printed word out loud). Running times were 6% slower following the incongruent Stroop task compared to the congruent Stroop task. This impaired running performance was accompanied by higher mental demand, and concurrent perceived exertion but similar mental fatigue, motivation, pacing, heart rate, and terminal perceived exertion. It was speculated that the elevated perceived exertion was due to increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex because activity in this brain region has been implicated in the performance of both cognitive and physical tasks (Tanaka et al.,\u00a02013), and positively correlated with perceived exertion during exercise tasks (Williamson et al.,\u00a02001, 2002).\nThese data are compatible with the argument that response inhibition during the cognitive task increased perceived exertion and impaired the subsequent bout of exercise. Taken together (MacMahon et al.,\u00a02014; Marcora et al.,\u00a02009; Pageaux et al.,\u00a02014), these findings show that cognitive tasks requiring response inhibition can impair subsequent self- paced endurance exercise regardless of the state of mental fatigue. Importantly, the evidence indicates that the detrimental effect of mental fatigue on subsequent submaximal whole- body endurance exercise is more likely to be accounted for by elevated perceived exertion rather than physiological limitations, such as cardiorespiratory and muscle activity (Martin et al.,\u00a02018; Pageaux & Lepers,\u00a02016; Van Cutsem et al., 2017) or pacing strategies (Schiphof- Godart et al.,\u00a02018). Accordingly, perception of effort has been deemed the \u201ccardinal exercise stopper\u201d during tasks with fixed demands (Staiano et al.,\u00a02018) and the \u201ccardinal exercise regulator\u201d during tasks with variable demands (Graham & Brown,\u00a02021).\nStudies indicate that performing a cognitive task impairs subsequent submaximal (Bray et al.,\u00a0 2008; Martin et al.,\u00a0 2015) but not maximal (Pageaux et al.,\u00a0 2013, 2015; Rozand et al.,\u00a0 2014) muscular contractions. Bray et al.\u00a0 (2008) reported that hold time while performing a 50% maximal voluntary contraction isometric handgrip task was reduced after completing a short (3:40 min) incongruent Stroop task (endurance\u00a0=\u00a032 s) compared to a congruent Stroop task (endurance\u00a0=\u00a046 s). The impaired performance was associated with increased forearm electromyographic activity, indicative of a higher neural drive activating muscle motor units to maintain the required\nforce. Similarly, a study examining the dose\u2013 response relationship between the duration of an incongruent Stroop task and isometric handgrip exercise at 50% maximum voluntary control found that the cognitive task needed to last at least 4\u00a0min to impair subsequent physical task performance (Brown & Bray,\u00a02017).\nMoreover, the duration of a response inhibition task was negatively associated with subsequent wall- sit time; i.e., the longer the cognitive task, the shorter the wall- sit (Boat et al.,\u00a02020). However, a meta- analysis (Giboin et al., 2019) concluded that prior cognitive task duration was unrelated to subsequent physical task performance. Clearly, evidence is mixed on this dose\u2013 response relationship and therefore further investigation is warranted. The evidence reviewed above establishes that a mentally fatiguing cognitive task can impair exercise endurance. Nonetheless, there remain gaps in our understanding of the nature of the relationship between mental fatigue and endurance performance. First, studies have yet to establish the role of cognitive task scheduling on subsequent exercise performance since previous studies have induced mental fatigue using a continuous cognitive task. Second, the importance of response inhibition during the cognitive task has yet to be established. Accordingly, to address these gaps, in the present study we examined the effects of an intermittent series of bouts of cognitive tasks, with and without response inhibition, on mental fatigue and self- paced rhythmic handgrip exercise.\nOur study purposes were threefold. The first study purpose was to assess the effects of a cognitively demanding task (with and without response inhibition) on psychological and physiological indices of mental fatigue as a function of time. The second study purpose was to investigate the effects of cognitive tasks on subsequent performance on a rhythmic handgrip muscular endurance task as a function of time. The third study purpose was to investigate the effects of cognitive tasks on psychological and physiological responses during the endurance task as a function of time. Based on the literature described above, we expected that ratings of mental fatigue would increase and heart rate variability (Ishii et al.,\u00a02014; Tanaka et al.,\u00a02009) would decrease as a function of time when completing a cognitive task with and without response inhibition. It was expected that a state of mental fatigue, induced by a cognitive task with response inhibition (Stroop) and a cognitive task with memory updating but without response inhibition (N- back), would similarly impair performance on a subsequent muscular endurance task. However, as no previous research has examined performance on a rhythmic handgrip muscular endurance task, it is difficult to specify the duration of prior cognitive task engagement required to impair performance. Finally, based on previous studies (e.g., MacMahon et al.,\u00a02014; Marcora et al.,\u00a02009)\nwe expected similar cardio- respiratory activity as well as increased perceived exertion and muscle activity during exercise."

Following an initial briefing, participants were instrumented for physiological measurements. They were asked to sit on a stool throughout and face a computer monitor positioned 1\u00a0m away at eye level. After determining the participant's maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) grip force, they were randomly assigned to one of three cognitive task groups. Each group completed four blocks of the 10- min cognitive task followed by a 5- min handgrip task. Participants provided ratings before and after each task. They received instruction and completed a 1- min familiarization of the cognitive task. A \u00a320 retail voucher was offered for the best overall task performance in each group.

A photograph of the dynamometer is shown in Figure\u00a0S2 (Supporting Information).\nParticipants performed a maximal contraction of the handgrip and the peak force was recorded. This was repeated three times, with each contraction separated by a 1- min rest to allow recovery, with the largest peak force achieved recorded as their maximum voluntary contraction. If the second- highest peak force was not within 5% of the highest another attempt was required."

They watched the first minute as a familiarization task.\n2.4.2 | 2- back (no response inhibition) cognitive task\nThe 2- back task (Braver et al.,\u00a01997) activates the anterior cingulate cortex (Tanaka et al.,\u00a0 2014), involves memory updating and attention but does not involve response inhibition (Owen et al.,\u00a0 2005). Participants were shown a continuous series of random consonants: they were required to indicate if the current letter displayed was the same as the one presented two letters earlier. The letters were displayed, once every 2\u00a0s for 500 ms, in the center of the monitor. Participants used their non- dominant hand to press the number 1 key on a keyboard if the current letter displayed was the same as the letter two prior, and the number 2 key if it was different. The task were implemented using E- Studio (version 2.0.1.97, Psychology Software Tools, Inc., USA). Task performance was assessed by the percentage of correct responses.\n2.4.3 | Stroop (response inhibition) cognitive task\nThe incongruent Stroop color word test (Stroop,\u00a0 1935) activates the anterior cingulate cortex, and involves\nattention, working memory, and response inhibition (Milham et al.,\u00a0 2003). A series of five color words (red, green, brown, yellow, and blue) were individually displayed in capital letters once every 2\u00a0 s in the center of the monitor in a different font color to the word meaning. Participants were instructed to verbally name the font color of the word as quickly and accurately as possible. The task was implemented using E- Studio. If the participant failed to name the correct color of the word whilst it was displayed, stutter, or self- correct, the response was deemed incorrect. Task performance was assessed by the percentage of correct answers."

A standardized script was read to participants before the task, at 150 s, and at 270 s, instructing them to generate as much force as possible in the timeframe for a chance of winning a \u00a320 voucher. The task time was displayed to participants at 60, 120, 180, 240, and 295 s. Performance was determined by the average peak force as a percentage of MVC per second (force %MVC/s) over the 5- min task.

Heart rate and heart rate variability were\ncomputed from the R- R intervals. The root mean square of the successive differences (rMSSD) and the standard deviation (SDNN) of the R- to- R wave interval were calculated as time domain surrogates of the high frequency (0.15 to 0.40 Hz) and lower (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) spectral band, respectively. These measures reflect changes in cardiac control via the parasympathetic and combined sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, respectively (Cooke et al.,\u00a02011).\n2.6.2 | Muscle activity The electromyographic activity of the forearm muscles used in gripping, the extensor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris, was measured using differential surface electrodes. Following skin preparation (alcohol wipe), they were positioned, alongside a reference electrode, longitudinally on the humorous at approximately 10\u00a0 cm from the medial epicondyle and 8\u00a0 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle, respectively (Cooke et al.,\u00a02011). Muscle activity was recorded using a Bagnoli- 2 system (Delsys, USA). The signals were rectified, averaged over 30 s, and normalized as a percentage of electromyographic activity at maximum voluntary contraction. Data were lost from seven participants due to noisy recordings during the handgrip task; this is reflected in the reduced degrees of freedom in the reported statistical analyses."

            "text": "The first study purpose was to assess the effects of a cognitively demanding task, with (Stroop) and without (2- back) response inhibition, on indices of mental fatigue as a function of time. In support of our hypothesis, participants reported greater mental fatigue, general fatigue, and mental exertion following both cognitive tasks relative to watching the documentary film (control). Ratings of mental fatigue increased threefold after completing both 40- min intermittent cognitive tasks. The magnitude of these increases in fatigue is in line with previous research that assessed mental fatigue following a continuous 45- min incongruent Stroop task (Smith et al.,\u00a0 2019) and a continuous 120- min, 2- back task (Tanaka et al.,\u00a02012). These latter studies only assessed fatigue upon task completion and therefore cannot shed light on the evolution of mental fatigue. In contrast, the current study found that mental fatigue increased relative to control after the first task block and continued to increase linearly across the four task blocks, indicating that 10\u00a0 min of cognitive tasks involving attention and working memory is sufficient to induce a state of mental fatigue. That a similar effect was elicited by both the 2- back and Stroop tasks indicates that response inhibition during the cognitive task is not necessary to induce mental fatigue. This argument is supported by previous findings demonstrating similar increases in mental fatigue following a 45- min psychomotor vigilance task, which does not require response inhibition, and following an incongruent Stroop task and AX Continuous Performance Test, which do require response inhibition (Smith et al.,\u00a02019). In sum, response inhibition is likely to be a sufficient rather than necessary condition for fatigue- induced performance detriments. Preliminary evidence that elite athletes perform better on response inhibition tasks than other athletes (Martin et al.,\u00a02016) suggests that superior inhibitory control might help\nresist the negative effects of mental fatigue and thereby contribute to successful endurance performance.\nCardiac activity was measured during the cognitive tasks to evaluate physiological correlates of mental fatigue. Heart rate was higher and heart rate variability lower during the cognitive tasks relative to control, indicative of more mental effort (Mulder,\u00a0 1992). There were no differences between the 2- back and Stroop groups, showing that effortful cognitive tasks that elicit changes in cardiac activity are independent of response inhibition processes. The finding that heart rate decreased, and heart rate variability increased as the blocks progressed for all three groups indicates that the impact of mental effort on cardiac activity waned with time. This observation, which is contrary to expectation, is likely to be due to increased task familiarity with exposure. A similar gradual time- related increase in heart rate variability has been reported in participants who engaged in mentally fatiguing Sudoku puzzles for 120 mins (Gergelyfi et al.,\u00a0 2015). Decreases in parasympathetic and increases in sympathetic activities have been observed by Tanaka and colleagues following one 30- min block (Tanaka et al.,\u00a02009) and four 30- min blocks (Tanaka et al.,\u00a02012) of a 2- back task. In the single 30- min block study, heart rate variability measures were averaged over 5- min epochs and suggested decreased vagal nerve activity after 10\u00a0min, which then plateaued for the remaining 20 mins of the 2- back test. In the current experiment, it is possible that the short breaks between the cognitive tasks, imposed by the physical task (5\u00a0min) and self- report measures (~1\u00a0min), in conjunction with increased task familiarity, contributed to the increased heart rate variability as the blocks progressed. Cognitive performance improved as the blocks progressed suggestive of task familiarity. These learning effects could be due to the intermittent blocks of physical and cognitive tasks as opposed to a continuous cognitive task where performance declines (Marcora et al.,\u00a02009). Heart rate variability did not change relative to baseline following 45- min cognitive tasks (Smith et al.,\u00a02019), which could represent a transient nature of mental effort and heart rate variability changes. However, when analyzed over 5- min blocks within the task, the psychomotor vigilance task (i.e., non- response inhibition) had a higher level of sympathetic activity relative to the response inhibition cognitive tasks. The authors suggest that this could be due to an increased attentional focus due to the demands of the psychomotor vigilance task relative to the Stroop and AX- CPT response inhibition tasks. The short breaks between presented stimuli in these tasks permit lapses in attentional focus (Ackerman,\u00a02011) and reduced cardiac reactivity. The discrepancy in heart rate variability during the Stroop task between their study\nand ours could be due to differences in the task. In our study, participants verbally stated the color of the word font rather than indicate the correct answer with a press of a button selected from two possible answers. Verbally stating the word could be more representative of response inhibition as a more natural reaction to a written word is to read and state it rather than press a button. Additionally, in our study all trials were incongruent whereas in their study half of the presented words were incongruent and half were congruent. In sum, there is a relationship between decreased heart rate variability, suggestive of increased mental effort, for cognitive tasks independent of response inhibition, which reduces as a function of time. In relation to our first study purpose, we have shown that engagement in prolonged intermittent cognitive tasks, with and without response inhibition, accentuates the psychological responses and attenuates the physiological responses."

            "text": "The second study purpose was to investigate the effects of cognitive task type and duration on subsequent performance on a rhythmic muscular endurance task. As expected, we found that a cognitive task, with or without response inhibition, impaired subsequent muscular endurance performance. This decline in performance was not due to changes in pacing strategy, which was the same for all groups. This finding is consistent with experiments on whole- body endurance exercise (MacMahon et al.,\u00a02014; Pageaux et al.,\u00a02014). It is noteworthy that handgrip performance did not deteriorate further over time in the cognitive task groups relative to the control group. This finding shows that mental fatigue impairs subsequent physical performance, but with no further impairments despite increasing mental fatigue. This is the first study to demonstrate a minimum threshold of engagement, of at least 10\u00a0min, on a mentally demanding cognitive task to impair performance on a subsequent rhythmic muscular endurance task. In comparison, a previous study reported that a 10- min Stroop task did not impair subsequent shuttle run performance (Sch\u00fccker & MacMahon,\u00a02016). The shortest cognitive task duration to impair whole- body endurance exercise is 30 min (Pageaux et al.,\u00a0 2014), whereas only a few minutes (~4\u00a0min) of a cognitive task can impair submaximal isometric exercise (Bray et al.,\u00a02008; Brown & Bray,\u00a02017). In relation to our second study purpose, we found that the cognitive task needs to last at least 10\u00a0min to impair performance on subsequent rhythmic handgrip exercise. This minimum task duration falls between those reported in the literature for isometric (a\nfew minutes) and whole- body (half an hour) endurance exercise."

            "text": "The third study purpose was to investigate the effects of cognitive task type and duration on psychological and physiological measures during the endurance task. Compared to the control group, the cognitive task groups experienced less interest and enjoyment during the physical tasks and more interest and enjoyment during the cognitive tasks. These group differences in interest and enjoyment, an indirect measure of intrinsic motivation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory,\u00a0 1994), suggest that the impaired exercise performance of the 2- back and Stroop groups may have been due to a decline in the desire to perform to the best of their ability. The performance- related monetary reward we offered, should have increased extrinsic motivation, and could have decreased intrinsic motivation (Deci,\u00a01972), however, this was offered to all participants, and, therefore, it cannot explain the group differences in interest and enjoyment. Participants were instructed to generate as much force as possible during the physical task, which would require maximal effort. The Stroop group reported lower perceived exertion ratings relative to the other two groups, which could be reflective of the lower physical performance relative to the control group and contrasts with our hypothesis and findings from previous experiments where perceived exertion is elevated following response inhibition tasks in time trial performance tasks (MacMahon et al.,\u00a02014; Pageaux et al.,\u00a0 2014). Also, contrary to expectation, we observed that heart rate and muscle activity declined over blocks in all groups in proportion to the lower force production. The control group's heart rate was higher during the physical tasks, which reflects their higher force production. The heart rate variability measures were suggestive of reduced mental effort as the blocks progressed. We did not observe elevated muscle activity following cognitive task engagement. This finding is contrary to some previous research with isometric handgrip (Bray et al.,\u00a0 2008) and whole- body cycling exercise (Pageaux et al.,\u00a0 2015), and could be due to either the intermittent nature of the rhythmic handgrip task and/or the duration of the cognitive tasks."

The findings\nshould be interpreted in light of a number of possible study limitations. First, the development of mental fatigue, as indexed by psychological and physiological measures, could be attenuated by the intermittent scheduling of the tasks, with a 5- min physical task after each 10- min cognitive task. Second, the physical performance deterioration in the 2- back and Stroop groups could be due to reduced extrinsic motivation as this construct was not measured. However, this is unlikely as monetary reward was offered to the participants to ensure that they were motivated for the tasks. Thirdly, additional physiological measures of effort could have been taken (i.e., pupillometry and electrography) alongside the heart rate variability measures. Finally, the study examined the effects of a cognitive task on rhythmic handgrip exercise performance. Care must be taken when generalizing from a muscular endurance task to whole- body endurance and isometric muscular endurance tasks."
