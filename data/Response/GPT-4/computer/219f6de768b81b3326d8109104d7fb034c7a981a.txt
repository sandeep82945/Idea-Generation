Optimizing Hyper-Parameter Selection through Automated Machine Learning (AutoML): Future research could explore the application of AutoML techniques for automatic hyper-parameter tuning and model architecture optimization in GFAC-1DCNN. This could potentially improve recognition accuracy and efficiency by systematically finding the best configurations without relying on trial-and-error methods.

Integration of Advanced Signal Processing Techniques: Investigating the integration of advanced signal processing methods, such as wavelet transforms or adaptive filtering, with GFAC-1DCNN could enhance the model's ability to extract and utilize more discriminative features from HRRP data. This could improve target recognition performance, especially in scenarios with high levels of noise or interference.

Fusion of Multimodal Data Sources for Enhanced Target Recognition: Expanding the model to fuse data from multiple sources (e.g., radar, infrared, optical) could offer a more comprehensive understanding of targets. Research into multimodal data fusion techniques could leverage the strengths of each data type, potentially improving recognition accuracy and robustness against decoys or stealth technologies.

Exploration of Transfer Learning and Few-Shot Learning for Rapid Adaptation: Given the challenge of obtaining large labeled datasets for specific target types, future work could explore the application of transfer learning and few-shot learning approaches within the GFAC-1DCNN framework. This would enable the model to quickly adapt to new targets or conditions with minimal additional data, enhancing the system's flexibility and responsiveness.

Deployment and Real-Time Performance Evaluation on Edge Devices: Conducting research on the optimization and deployment of GFAC-1DCNN on edge computing devices for real-time ballistic missile defense applications. This involves investigating model compression, quantization, and hardware acceleration techniques to ensure that the model operates within the computational and power constraints of edge devices, while maintaining high recognition accuracy and speed.
