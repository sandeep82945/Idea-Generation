1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of SN-1 derivatives:** 
Synthesize and test a series of SN-1 derivatives with varying substituents to determine how these changes affect binding affinity and inhibitory activity against TRAF6. This information could be used to design even more potent and selective TRAF6 inhibitors.


2. **Explore the use of SN-1 derivatives in combination with other anti-inflammatory or anticancer agents:** 
Determine whether SN-1 derivatives can synergize with other drugs to enhance their efficacy against inflammatory diseases or cancer. This could lead to the development of new combination therapies that are more effective than either drug alone.


3. **Investigate the effects of SN-1 derivatives on TRAF6 signaling pathways:** 
Determine how SN-1 derivatives affect the activation of downstream signaling pathways that are regulated by TRAF6, such as the NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways. This information could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which SN-1 derivatives exert their anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects.


4. **Evaluate the safety and efficacy of SN-1 derivatives in animal models of inflammatory diseases or cancer:** 
Conduct preclinical studies in animal models to assess the safety and efficacy of SN-1 derivatives in vivo. This information would be essential for advancing these compounds to clinical trials in humans.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SN-1 derivatives in humans:** 
If SN-1 derivatives are found to be safe and effective in animal models, clinical trials would be conducted to evaluate their safety and efficacy in humans with inflammatory diseases or cancer. This would be the ultimate step in the drug development process and could lead to the approval of SN-1 derivatives as new therapeutic agents.
