They also serve as the first hydration shell to intercalate cations (e.g. K+ in K+-birnessite).4,6,7 Interlayer identity can, at the same time, influence the thermal stability of the hydration layer. For example, monovalent cations promote dehydration at lower temperatures than divalent cations.6 Removing water from the interlayer promotes, in turn, structural disordered birnessite at a temperature of 200 1C in Li+-birnessite or even a cryptomelane-like (KMn8O16) structure in K+-birnessite at 400\u2013600 1C.5 Birnessite that underwent dehydration, yet that retained its crystallographic structure, can only be rehydrated up to a single monolayer (1W = 1.33 H2O per unit cell) when exposed to moist air under ambient conditions.4 Previous studies4\u20136,25,26 revealed the structure, stability and reactivity of intercalated water films. However, some studies were conducted under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure,5,6 which may have a compromised birnessite structure.\nThis study focuses on investigating the thermal behaviours of intercalated water in birnessite,4,27 and is built upon a previous study by our group on these reactions at 25 1C.4 In this work, we focused on K+-birnessite because it dehydrates at low temperature while its structure remains unchanged at temperatures as high as 400 1C.5,6 We used vibrational spectroscopy to monitor the ability of K+-birnessite to trap and release water vapour across a range of temperatures. Molecular simulations provided new insights into the temperature-resolved properties of intercalated water. As temperature is a critical factor in controlling the reaction kinetics, this work serves as a basis for further studies on the behaviour of birnessite in hot and moist air."

K+-birnessite was synthesised by the reduction of KMnO4 under acidic conditions. 11,28 A vigorously stirred 2.5 L solution of 0.4 M KMnO4 kept at 90 1C was titrated with a 166 mL solution of 12 M HCl.11 The suspension was continuously stirred and kept at 90 1C for an additional 10 min after the titration. The resulting \u2018\u2018acid birnessite\u2019\u201911 suspension was then washed with MilliQ water by repeated cycles of centrifugation/decantation until the conductivity was B10 mS cm 1. The washed materials were then stored as the aqueous suspension in polyethylene bottles at 4 1C for a 3-year period prior to the onset of this work.\nA portion of the sample was oven-dried at 60 1C for particle characterization, and a detailed account of which was already\npresented in our previous study.4 Briefly, the solid phase was a low crystalline birnessite phase with a Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013 Teller (B.E.T.)29 specific surface area of 59.2 m2 g 1. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the particles had a surface Mn : O : K composition of 1.00 : 1.49 : 0.20. We note that the O/Mn ratio was lower than the expected stoichiometric value of 2 because XPS probes the topmost 10 nm region of the samples, and because of the loss of chemisorbed water under ultra-vacuum conditions. XPS also revealed that the surface of birnessite had a Mn atomic oxidation state (AOS) of 3.69. Using the method of Ilton et al.30 this AOS arises from a mixture of 72% MnIV, 25% MnIII, and 3% MnII.\nWater vapour intercalation experiments\nBinding of water vapour on birnessite during dynamic vapour sorption (DVS)31 was monitored by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. All FTIR spectra were collected using a Bruker Vertex 70/V FTIR spectrometer, equipped with a DLaTGS detector. The spectra were collected at a resolution of 4.0 cm 1 in the 600\u20134000 cm 1 range, and at a forward/reverse scanning rate of 10 kHz. Each spectrum was an average of 500 scans, taking a total of 7.14 min per spectrum. A representative spectrum of dry birnessite is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI\u2020).\nCentrifuged wet pastes of birnessite were deposited on the diamond window of an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell (Golden Gate N29328 by Specac). This ATR cell was equipped with a heating unit enabling measurements at a temperature of 80 1C. The wet birnessite film was then covered with a modified Golden Gate cryo-chamber equipped with a gas inlet and an outlet, enabling a flow of 500 mL min 1 N2(g) over the sample. Prior to each experiment, wet pastes were first dried and then equilibrated under a steam dry N2(g) at pre-selected temperatures in the range of 30\u201380 1C (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 1C). FTIR spectra were thereafter collected to monitor the loss of water using the absorbances of the O\u2013H stretching and bending bands of water.\nWater vapour adsorption/desorption isotherms were then collected at each temperature by exposing birnessite to a 500 mL min 1 flow of 10 pre-selected partial pressures of H2O in the range of 0\u20133.11 kPa (i.e. 0.4\u201395% relative humidity at 25 1C) with 98.2\u2013101.3 kPa N2 (g). A 1 h equilibration period was allowed between each change in H2O content. These gases were prepared at 25 1C by mixing pre-determined proportions of humid N2 (g) produced from a humidity generator module (proUmid MHG32) with dry N2 (g). Water vapour pressures were continuously monitored using both a sensor equipped with the module and a nondispersive InfraRed device (LI-7000, Licor Inc).\nTo study the temperature-resolved changes in the birnessitebound water, we analysed the O\u2013H stretching and bending vibrational regions by spectral deconvolution. Following preliminary efforts testing various distribution functions, we found that absorbances of the O\u2013H stretching region (AO\u2013H) were best modelled by a linear combination of Gaussian components:\nAO H \u00bc Xn\n1\nAn;O H; maxe v vn\u00f0 \u00de=sn\u00f0 \u00de2 (1)\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The samples were reacted in an optical transmission cell (AABSPEC#2000-A) for vibrational spectroscopy and then exposed to vacuum of less than 0.3 kPa. These samples were then exposed to a heating gradient of 10 1C min 1 from 40 to 400 1C, during which time the FTIR spectra were collected as H2O was released from the interlayer region of birnessite."

This was achieved by successive simulations at 10 selected temperatures (0, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, and 85 1C) of birnessite supercells intercalated with decreasing amounts of water. The supercells consisted of 6 12 4 unit cells (UCs)7 having an initial composition of K144[Mn576O1152] (H2O)3840, hence 0.25 K+/UC and an initial water content of 13.333 H2O/UC. After equilibration by energy minimisation followed by 2 ns of volume and pressure optimization, 61 successive productions were run in the isobaricisothermal (NPT) ensemble. All simulations were carried out at a 1 fs time step. In between each of the production runs, 16 water molecules (corresponding to approx. 0.22 H2O/UC) of randomly selected water molecules were removed from each interlayer region, all while preserving the same d001. Each water removal step was followed by a 500 ps pre-equilibration run, which was not included in the analysis.\nAll simulations were carried out using GROMACS,32 using a 1.0 nm cutoff for the direct van der Waals and Coulombic interactions. Long-range Coulombic interactions were treated using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method. The birnessite lattice was, just as in our recent study,4 modelled with Mn3.75+ as in the study of Cygan et al..33 However, using the recently reported Lennard\u2013Jones forcefield parameters of Newton and Kwon,34 water was simulated using the SPC/E model,35 and K+\nions were simulated with SPC/E compatible ion-pair potentials from the study of Joung and Cheatham.36\nSimulation results were thereafter analysed for d001, hydrogen bonding, K+\u2013O coordination, and K+ and water diffusion coefficients. Diffusion coefficients were calculated with the Gromacs utility gmx msd from 3 ns production runs over individual 250 ps segments, omitting the first 50 ps in each. Comparison of diffusion coefficients obtained in the canonical (NVT) ensemble confirmed that the short simulations and large box sizes did not introduce deviations in values that could otherwise be expected37 from the simulation run in the NPT ensemble (Fig. S2, ESI\u2020).\nFinally, energetics of stable hydration states were determined using the following equation:38,39\nQ(N) = U(N) U(N1) Ubulk(N N1) (3)\nwhere Q(N) is the hydration immersion energy (J g 1) relative to a reference hydration state N1, N is H2O/UC, hUi is the time-averaged potential energy, and Ubulk is the mean interaction energy of a bulk SPC/E water molecule, at each temperature. In practice, Ubulk is a fitting parameter making Q(N) reaching a similar value to the bulk vaporisation energy of water at high N."

These were given by the O\u2013H stretching (n1; e.g. Fig. 2a and b) and the bending (n2; e.g. Fig. 2c and d) vibrational regions of water. The absorbances of these regions responded directly to variations in water vapour content (0.01\u20133.11 kPa H2O) during both adsorption and desorption legs.\nVapour pressure- and temperature-dependent water loadings were more clearly captured using the integrated normalised absorbances of both O\u2013H stretching (Fig. 2e) and water bending (Fig. 2f) regions. First, the shape of these spectroscopically derived adsorption isotherms was consistent with our previous4 microgravimetric data (Fig. 2g). Both revealed a type II adsorption/ desorption40 isotherm, with comparable hysteresis in the desorption leg. Our previous modelling efforts4 expressed water uptake chiefly in terms of intercalated water, reaching a maximum coverage of a single water monolayer (1W) at a high humidity (B1.33 H2O per unit cell (UC)). Adsorbed and condensed water accounted for a smaller fraction of water, with the latter accounting for the larger loadings at high humidity only. From the absorbances of the vibrational spectra, we also found that water loadings were lowered by B50% at temperatures exceeding B40 1C (Fig. 2e and f). These temperature-adjusted isotherms also showed that even atmospherically relevant partial pressures of water (e.g. up to 3.11 kPa H2O) at high temperatures could not saturate the interlayer region of birnessite with water.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The O\u2013H stretching region was modelled at all temperatures in terms of (Gaussian-shaped; eqn (1)) bands at (i) 3574 15 cm 1 from free (isolated) O\u2013H bonds of water bonded to basal oxygens (OB; Fig. 1) of the interlayer region, (ii) 3470 9 cm 1 from hydrogen-bonded water (weak intermolecular coupling41,42), (iii) 3276 30 cm 1 from hydrogen-bonded water (strong intermolecular coupling41,42) and Fermi resonance (2 n2) of the water bending mode (n2 = 1622 cm\n1), and (iv) 3189 2 cm 1 likely representing a distinct sub-population of intercalated hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Band positions were not greatly affected by temperature (Fig. S4, ESI\u2020).\nThese assignments were supported by the following water vapour pressure dependence on component absorbances (Fig. 3g\u2013l). O\u2013H groups from intercalated water (3574 and 3189 cm 1) followed a type II adsorption isotherm akin to our modelling of the microgravimetry data, plateauing at B0.6 kPa H2O (Fig. 2g). The number of hydrogen-bonded water molecules increased throughout the range of 0\u20133.11 kPa, first through a steep increase with humidity akin to that of intercalated water, and through a lower response to humidity from externally bound (adsorbed and condensed) water (Fig. 2g).\nModelling of the water bending region revealed (Lorentzianshaped; eqn (2)) bands at (i) B1592 10 cm 1 from intercalated water and (ii) B1622 8 cm 1 from liquid-like water.\nAgain, band positions were not systematically affected by temperature (Fig. S4, ESI\u2020). The water vapour pressure dependence of the 1592 cm 1 band chiefly aligned with that of O\u2013H stretching bands of intercalated water (3574 and 3189 cm 1). The lower bending frequencies of the intercalated water also aligned with the expectation of a strong hydrogen bond with the basal oxygen sites of the interlayer region of birnessite. The B1622 cm 1 term, on the other hand, continued to increase in absorbance as a result of the increased water loadings. This can be taken as evidence that liquid water-like films appeared at birnessite nanoparticle surfaces.\nFinally, the temperature-dependence of component absorbances (Fig. 4) reflected the exothermic nature of the water binding reactions, as expected from calorimetric studies.43 Total absorbances suggest a loss of water of at least B40% when birnessite was heated from 30 1C up to at least 50 1C. This loss in absorbance can be explained by the removal of all types of water from birnessite (Fig. 4b and c). In particular, the loss of bands from water molecules that were hydrogen-bonded to basal oxygens (3574, 3189 and 1592 cm 1) suggested that interlayer water films were preferentially removed within the 40\u201350 1C range.\nThe temperature dependence of the band components (Fig. 4b) also revealed no preferential loss in water molecules that were hydrogen-bonded to basal oxygens (3574 and 3189 cm 1) over those that were more weakly hydrogen-bonded to water (3470 cm 1). The loss of the 3276 cm 1 band (Fig. 4b) however indicated that water\u2013water interactions were preferentially disrupted with temperature.44 This can also be seen in the water\nFig. 2 (a)\u2013(d) FTIR spectra of birnessite exposed to a 500 mL min 1 flow of 0\u20133.11 kPa H2O in N2(g) (a total pressure of 101 kPa) during the adsorption leg.

These simulations build upon those we previously reported for intercalated water at 25 1C, and more than covered the experimental range considered in this study.\nSimulations (Fig. 5\u20137 and Fig. S6, S7, ESI\u2020) showed that the interlayer spacings for one (1W) and two water monolayers (2W) were practically independent of temperature (Fig. 5a). The 2W state, known as buserite, can however only be attained by submerging birnessite in liquid water.1,45,46 Additionally, immersion energies in the 1W state were\nlarger at higher temperatures, a result consistent with the concept for more exothermic reactions at high temperatures (Fig. 5b).43\nIn previous studies,47,48 our 1W hydration state was nearlymonoclinic, with cell dimensions that were nearly independent of temperature (a = 0.511, b = 0.295, and c = 0.706 nm; d001 = 0.685 nm because UC b = 104.01; Fig. 1). Additionally, K+ and water oxygens (OW) were consistently at the centre of the interlayer region between oxygens of the basal face (Ob) of birnessite, a result aligning with previous MD work.33 Total K+ coordination numbers (B9.7 O/K+) were consistently from B5.2 Ow on the same plane of the 1W water layer, and B4.5 Ob from both the basal faces of MnO2 per K\n+ ion. These numbers were also independent of temperature for 1W.\nThe most relevant piece of information that links back to our FTIR results relates to hydrogen bond numbers, as these\nFig. 3 Band deconvolution of the O\u2013H stretching (a)\u2013(c) and water bending (d)\u2013(f) regions for samples reacted at 30 1C.

These were dominated by interactions with basal oxygens (1.83 Ob/H2O) and a minute portion involved in water\u2013water interactions (0.13 bond/H2O). These results consequently align with our previous finding that the increase in vibrational bands of \u2018liquid water-like\u2019 components (1592, 3189 and 3574 cm 1 in Fig. 2 and 3) was not from intercalated water but adsorbed and condensed water at birnessite particle surfaces (Fig. 2g).\nFrom these results, we conclude that variations in water loadings with temperature can only be explained in terms of the dynamics of the 1W layer, as the structure and molecular interactions remained unchanged (Fig. 6). This aligns with the large temperature-driven increases in water and K+ diffusion coefficients (Fig. 7). While the 1W state had the lowest diffusion coefficients for any nW state (Fig. 7a), these values increased by nearly one order of magnitude at 85 1C (Fig. 7c). Those of K+ remained, on the other hand, relatively unchanged with temperature. Because K+ (0.266 nm) and H2O (0.275 nm) have similar sizes, the chief factor influencing the smaller temperature-dependent diffusivity of K+ is its charge. As such, while increasing temperatures effectively enhanced water mobility along the 1W layer, the K+ ion mobility was systematically lower due to electrostatic interactions with Ob sites (4.5 Ob/K + in 1W). K+ diffusivity in the 2W state, in contrast, increased on par with water with temperature because the first shell K+\u2013Ob interactions ({1 Ob/K+) were replaced by K+\u2013Ow interactions (Fig. 6b). We therefore attribute the diminished capability of the interlayer region of birnessite to store water in the 1W state at high temperatures to the compounded effects of (i) increased evolved heat (i.e. exothermicity), and (ii) the larger mobility of water over that of K+ with temperature."

            "text": "Using vibrational spectroscopy and molecular modelling, we showed that birnessite intercalates one water (1W) monolayer at up to B40 1C. Above this temperature, water loadings decreased B2-fold as a result of the increased heat evolved, and the larger mobility of water compared to that of K+ with temperature. While these factors destabilized water films at high temperatures, hydrogen bond numbers and K+ solvation environments remained unchanged. The information gathered in this work consequently clarified the role of temperature on the interlayer hydration environment of birnessite. This information should be especially useful in the study of hot water-unsaturated natural environments (e.g. vadose zones of soils) as well as in several technological applications including energy storage and atmospheric water capture by these, and related, materials.\nFig. 5 (a) Predicted immersion energy profiles versus water loadings (H2O/UC; UC = unit cell) showing the 1W state at 1.33 H2O/UC (5.33 H2O/K +; d001-spacing = 0.685 nm) and the 2W state at 3.33 H2O/UC (13.33 H2O/K +; d001-spacing = 1.00 nm).

The first-shell coordination of K+ to oxygens belongs to either water (OW) or birnessite (Ob) oxygens.
