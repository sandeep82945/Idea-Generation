conclusions The current COVID-19 disease poses a physical threat to human lives, prompting countries to adopt social distancing and lockdown measures to contain the spread of the virus. Although these measures were introduced rapidly at the beginning of the pandemic, they likely will remain for some time in view of the new waves, which calls for studies examining how these changes affect people’s work experience and incomes and their influence on mental health in the long-term. Our results indicate that working from home under fixed schedules and unemployment impact negatively on mental health. Income loss and particularly self-reported financial problems were also associated with mental health problems, in agreement with the growing literature on economic burden and mental health during the COVID‐19 pandemic.
