Birrell *ae\n[FeFe] hydrogenases are exceptionally active catalysts for the interconversion of molecular hydrogen with\nprotons and electrons. Their active site, the H-cluster, is composed of a [4Fe\u20134S] cluster covalently linked\nto a unique [2Fe] subcluster. These enzymes have been extensively studied to understand how the protein\nenvironment tunes the properties of the Fe ions for efficient catalysis. The sensory [FeFe] hydrogenase\n(HydS) from Thermotoga maritima has low activity and displays a very positive redox potential for the\n[2Fe] subcluster compared to that of the highly active prototypical enzymes. Using site directed\nmutagenesis, we investigate how second coordination sphere interactions of the protein environment\nwith the H-cluster in HydS influence the catalytic, spectroscopic and redox properties of the H-cluster.\nIn particular, mutation of the non-conserved serine 267, situated between the [4Fe\u20134S] and [2Fe]\nsubclusters, to methionine (conserved in prototypical catalytic enzymes) gave a dramatic decrease in\nactivity. Infra-red (IR) spectroelectrochemistry revealed a 50 mV lower redox potential for the [4Fe\u20134S]\nsubcluster in the S267M variant. We speculate that this serine forms a hydrogen bond to the [4Fe\u20134S]\nsubcluster, increasing its redox potential. These results demonstrate the importance of the secondary\ncoordination sphere in tuning the catalytic properties of the H-cluster in [FeFe] hydrogenases and reveal\na particularly important role for amino acids interacting with the [4Fe\u20134S] subcluster."

            "text": "[FeFe]-hydrogenases catalyze the reversible conversion of protons and electrons to H2 at very high rates under ambient conditions and with minimal energy waste (overpotential).1 The active center of [FeFe] hydrogenases, known as the H-cluster, consists of a classical [4Fe\u20134S] cluster (called [4Fe\u20134S]H) covalently linked via a cysteine residue to a unique [2Fe] cluster (called [2Fe]H).2 In the latter, the iron atoms are coordinated by two terminal CO and CN\u2212 ligands, a bridging CO ligand, and a bridging 2-azapropane-1,3-dithiolate (ADT) ligand (Fig. 1A).3 Based on amino acid sequences, phylogeny, subunit architectures and genetic organization, [FeFe] hydrogenases are classied into three groups: (a) prototypical and electron-bifurcating,\ny Conversion, Stistra\u00dfe 34-36, 45470\nongdar.nipa@gmail.com\nona Paula-403004, Goa, India istry Laboratory, University of Oxford,\nof Hyogo, Koto 3-2-1, Kamigori, Ako, 678- ogo.ac.jp Colchester, CO4 3SQ, UK.

See DOI:\n92\n(b) ancestral, and (c) sensory.4 Since the prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases display excellent 2H+/H2 interconversion activity, this group has been most extensively studied.5 However, understanding other classes of [FeFe] hydrogenases is crucial for the general understanding of these fascinating enzymes. This information will unravel new facets that, in turn, can be benecial for biomimetic research to develop affordable yet efficient hydrogen evolution catalysts. In an effort to look beyond the prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenase, we recently investigated the functional and spectroscopic properties of the sensory [FeFe] hydrogenase from Thermotoga (T.) maritima (TmHydS).6\nThe genome of the anaerobic hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima contains genes encoding three different types of [FeFe] hydrogenases; an electron bifurcating hydrogenase, a prototypical hydrogenase and a sensory hydrogenase (HydS).7,8 Although the physiological role of HydS is unclear, it is assumed to regulate the expression of another hydrogenase gene present in the same operon, in response to changes in H2 concentration in the cell.4,9 In contrast to the other two groups of [FeFe] hydrogenases, HydS contains a PAS (Per\u2013Arnt\u2013Sim) domain along with the hydrogenase domain (Fig. 1A). PAS domains are versatile sensory modules found in signal transduction proteins from all three kingdoms of life. Despite having very low sequence conservation, PAS domains have a conserved three-dimensional scaffold consisting of a core with ve\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Mutating them has severe effects on catalytic activities of the protein, thus, indicating the importance of the protein framework in maintaining the enzyme's outstanding activity.15\nComparative sequence analyses of prototypical (Clostridium pasteurianumHydA1, CpHydA1 or CpI, for which the structure is known) and sensory (TmHydS) [FeFe] hydrogenases showed that the cysteine residues ligating the iron atoms of the H-cluster and the residues stabilizing the proper conformation of the [2Fe] cofactor by H-bonding interactions are conserved in sensory type [FeFe] hydrogenases (Fig. 1B).4,6,16 However, three non-coordinating amino acids, C299, M353 and M497 (in CpHydA1), which are also quite well conserved in prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases, are altered in sensory type enzymes (Fig. 1B). Mutations of these residues, dramatically reduced the catalytic activity of these prototypical enzymes.15 Therefore, variations in amino acid identities surrounding the H-cluster in sensory and prototypical type [FeFe] hydrogenases could be the reason for their differences in catalytic activities and physiological function.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The resulting TmHydS variants were biochemically and spectroscopically characterized in order to understand the role these amino acids play in regulating catalytic activity and the electronic structure of the H-cluster. In particular, we found that mutating S267 (equivalent to M497 in CpHydA1) to methionine resulted in a substantial loss in activity, which appears to result from a change in the redox potential of the [4Fe\u20134S]H subcluster. The effects on the catalytic activity and the differences with the prototypical hydrogenase are discussed."

These residues, especially alanine, do not appear to be suitable proton acceptor/donor sites, thus, suggesting that the proton channel may be different in sensory [FeFe] hydrogenases. Therefore, such non-conservative variations in amino acid identity suggest that this position may not play an important role in the functioning of HydS. Despite the fact that TmHydS contains alanine in this position (A131) it shows much higher activity than the C299A variant of CpI (or the C169A variant of CrHydA1).15,20 On the other hand, the activity of TmHydS ismuch lower thanWT CpI and CrHydA1. In an attempt to increase the activity of TmHydS, and further study the role of this amino acid, wemutated residue A131 in TmHydS to cysteine.\nAnother residue in prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases that interacts with the bridge-head amine group of the ADT ligand is a conserved methionine (M497 in CpI), whose mutation to leucine severely reduced the catalytic activity of the enzyme.15 Spectroscopic analysis indicated that the M497L variant lacked a properly integrated [2Fe]H cluster, explaining its diminished activity.15 In sensory [FeFe] hydrogenases, however, the amino acid in this position is not conserved (Fig. S1\u2020). In TmHydS, this position (267) is occupied by a serine residue (Fig. 1B). In spite of this, the articially maturated protein showed typical spectroscopic signatures, indicating proper incorporation of the [2Fe]H cluster in TmHydS.6 Here, we have mutated this residue to methionine (S267M variant) to explore the function of this position in TmHydS.\nThe third residue, a conserved methionine in prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases (M353 in CpI), has been proposed to stabilize the bridging CO ligand through electrostatic interaction between the sulfur atom of the methionine and the oxygen atom of the bridging CO. Mutating M353 in prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases also lowered their catalytic activity, but not as severely as the other two aforementioned residues.15 In sensory [FeFe] hydrogenases, this position is mostly occupied by small amino acids like glycine (z51%), serine (z32%) or threonine (z17%). In the prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases CpII and CpIII this residue is replaced by Thr and Gly, respectively.25\u201328 These enzymes show high levels of activity, however, with a strongly altered catalytic bias. In TmHydS, this position is occupied by a glycine (G177) and we have also mutated this residue in TmHydS (G177M variant) to get some insight on how this position inuences the properties of the H-cluster in sensory [FeFe] hydrogenases.\nFrom a homology modelled structure of TmHydS, we hypothesize that Y223 (corresponds to the F417 residue in CpI), which lies in the vicinity of the amine-bridge of the H-cluster, could act as an alternative proton transfer residue (Fig. S2A\u2020). It is notable here that in prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases, this position is occupied by a phenylalanine residue (Fig. S2B\u2020). Therefore, apart from the three aforementioned amino acids, residue Y223 in TmHydS was mutated to phenylalanine to investigate this hypothesis.\n3684 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3682\u20133692\nIsolation of the apo TmHydS variants\nThe TmHydS variants, A131C, S267M, G177M and Y223F were produced by site directed mutagenesis using the primers listed in Table S1\u2020 and the plasmid of WT-TmHydS as a template (for the detailed method, please see ESI text 1\u2020). The apo-forms (protein containing only the four [4Fe\u20134S] clusters but lacking the [2Fe] subsite of the H-cluster) of the TmHydS variants were prepared using our previously published protocol.6 The yields of all variants except G177M (which decreased by z50%, data not shown) were comparable to WT-TmHydS.\nLike WT-TmHydS, the UV-vis spectra of all variants showed a broad feature in the 350\u2013500 nm region with the highest intensity at 410 nm, indicating the presence of [4Fe\u20134S] clusters (Fig. S3\u2020). The ratio of the absorption intensities at 280 nm and 400 nm, which provide a qualitative measure of FeS cluster incorporation, were for all variants similar to that of the wild type, indicating that the FeS cluster assembly was not affected by the mutations. Since a fully assembled [4Fe\u20134S]H cluster is a prerequisite for the successful incorporation of the [2Fe]ADT complex,29 we determined the iron content of the TmHydS variants to estimate the number of FeS clusters in the proteins (Table S2\u2020). Like WT-TmHydS, all variants possessed z15 moles iron per mole of protein, in agreement with the expected presence of four [4Fe\u20134S] clusters. To obtain the holo-form of the TmHydS variants, the puried apo-proteins were incubated with [2Fe]ADT complex (see methods in ESI, ESI text 1\u2020), and aer removal of the excess [2Fe]ADT, the spectroscopic properties and the enzymatic activities of these variants were examined in detail.\nSpectroscopic characterization of the TmHydS variants\nIn order to determine whether the TmHydS variants were successfully maturated using the \u2018articial-maturation\u2019 technique, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on these proteins. Compared to the [2Fe]ADT complex in solution, the \u2018as-isolated\u2019 samples of the TmHydS variants showed signicantly narrower CO and CN\u2212 FTIR bands, indicating successful incorporation of the [2Fe]H cofactor (Fig. S4A\u2020). In the as-isolated state, the variants A131C, G177M and Y223F showed FTIR bands at very similar positions (2055, 2022, 1893, 1872 and 1762 cm\u22121) to those of WT-TmHydS, whereas, the S267M variant showed small (2\u20134 cm\u22121) red-shis (i.e. lower wavenumbers) of all FTIR bands (except the bridging CO band) (Fig. S4A\u2020). This suggests that none of these mutations led to major changes in the interactions between the polypeptide chain forming the active site pocket and the Hcluster. Additionally, the presence of just ve IR bands with similar energies suggests that all variants exist in a single redox state under these conditions (2% H2, pH 8, 15 \u00b0C), as observed previously for the WT enzyme.6 In the WT enzyme this state was determined to be the one-electron reduced state (named H*red, vide infra). The fact that all the variants appear to be in the same state under these conditions suggests that the electronic structure of the H-cluster has not been signicantly perturbed.\nNext, we determined if all TmHydS variants have similar levels of H-cluster occupancy by comparing the ratios of intensity of the most intense CO stretching band (1872 cm\u22121) to the intensity of\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In the A131C, Y223F and S267M variants this ratio was found to be comparable toWTTmHydS indicating that the incorporation of the [2Fe]H cluster is not affected by these mutations. In the case of the G177M variant, this ratio was approximately 2-fold lower than WTTmHydS (Fig. S4C\u2020). It is possible that the bulky methionine side chain disturbs the integration of the [2Fe]H subsite.\nThe positions of CO and CN\u2212 vibrational bands in FTIR spectroscopy serve as excellent indicators of the redox-state of the H-cluster. This is because reduction of the H-cluster leads to increased electron density on the Fe ions, which increases backbonding into the CO and CN\u2212 ligand p* orbitals, which weakens and lengthens the CO and CN\u2212 bonds and shis their IR vibrational frequencies to lower energy.5 Formal reduction of the [2Fe]H subcluster gives the largest shis (z50 cm\n\u22121), while formal reduction of the [4Fe\u20134S]H subcluster only partially increases the electron density on [2Fe]H, giving smaller shis (z10 cm\u22121). Hence, this method is widely used in [FeFe] hydrogenase research. We have previously shown that the asisolated state in WT-TmHydS is a one-electron reduced state in which the electron density mostly resides on [2Fe]H, the so-called (unprotonated) H*red state [4Fe\u20134S]\n2+\u2013[Fe(I)\u2013Fe(I)] in which electron and proton transfer are decoupled.6 As mentioned before, all four variants showed the same FTIR bands in the as isolated state. Therefore, it appears that all four variants are in the H*red state under these conditions. Treatment of all four variants with a reducing agent (sodium dithionite) resulted in FTIR spectra (Fig. 2A) essentially the same as the as-isolated state, conrming that the active center is already reduced. In the A131C variant, a shoulder at 1860 cm\u22121 is visible, probably from partial further reduction to the H*sred state [4Fe\u20134S]\n+\u2013[Fe(I)\u2013Fe(I)], where [4Fe\u2013 4S]H is also reduced. This may indicate a slightly more positive redox potential for the H*red=H * sred state in this variant. Moreover, peaks at 1960 cm\u22121 and 1980 cm\u22121 are visible, possibly from an additional, as yet unidentied, reduced state of TmHydS. Evidence for this state is also present in the other variants at similar energies. Based on similarities of the positions of the FTIR bands, this could represent the Hhyd:red or Hhyd:ox states with an over-oxidized [2Fe]H subcluster and a reduced or oxidized [4Fe\u20134S]H subcluster, respectively.30\nWe then oxidized the variants using the redox dye, thionine. The FTIR spectra of A131C, Y223F and G177M variants showed large (>35 cm\u22121) blue-shis of the CO and CN\u2212 ligand vibrational bands following treatment with thionine, suggesting oxidation of [2Fe]H to give the most oxidized state, the so-called Hox state [4Fe\u20132S]2+\u2013[Fe(II)\u2013Fe(I)]. However, thionine treatment was insufcient to oxidize the S267M variant and so a slightly stronger oxidizing agent, hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride (HAR) was used (Fig. 2B). The FTIR peaks of thionine- or HAR-oxidized samples of the TmHydS variants appeared at similar positions (Fig. 2B) and resembled the FTIR spectra of the Hox state from WT-TmHydS. In the A131C variant, a residual peak from the H*red state in the thionine-oxidized sample can still be observed.\nWe next performed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on all these oxidized proteins to analyze how the mutations affect the magnetic properties of the H-cluster. In the Hox state, [2Fe]H is in a mixed valent Fe(II)Fe(I) conguration and\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Apart from small differences around the g = 2 region attributable to the reduced thionine radical, the EPR spectra of all the variants are essentially identical but with small shis in the g-values of the features in the spectrum, which can be assigned to small perturbations in the electronic structure of the H-cluster (Fig. 3).\nCatalytic activity of the TmHydS variants\nNext, we assessed the enzyme activity of the variants using viologen based H2 oxidation and H\n+ reduction solution assays at 70 \u00b0C, the optimal temperature for enzyme activity in WTTmHydS (for experimental details see ESI\u2020).

Initially, we had expected that incorporation of a cysteine at the end of the traditional proton transfer pathway to the H-cluster might restore proton transfer and, therefore, facilitate much higher activity. However, it is important to note that other amino acids within this pathway (E279, E282, S319 in CpI) are also different in HydS and other sensory [FeFe] hydrogenases (Fig. S5\u2020), and that studies on prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases have shown each of these residues to play a critical role in proton transfer.20 Nevertheless, the results from this variant strongly imply that HydS has an alternative proton transfer pathway. Additionally, the decrease in activity of the A131C variant compared with WT suggests that the cysteine in this position interacts with the ADT ligand in the H-cluster in\n3686 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3682\u20133692\nthis variant, possibly interfering with the alternative proton transfer pathway.\nThe G177M variant showed 50% lower H2 oxidation and 30% lower proton reduction activities (Fig. 4). This result ts well with the lower loading of [2Fe]H in this variant mentioned earlier, thus, on a per [2Fe]H site basis the activity is very similar to WT. The Y223F variant showed somewhat higher H2 oxidation activity (z25% higher) than the WT, and marginally lower (z10% lower) H2 production activity compared to the WT, suggesting that this residue does not play a role in proton transfer in TmHydS (Fig. 4).\nUnexpectedly the S267M variant shows a drastic drop in both H2 oxidation (z95% lower than WT) and H2 production (93% lower than WT) activities (Fig. 4). Such a severe effect on activity indicates that S267 plays a crucial role in TmHydS and its mutation could have introduced some local structural deformation in the protein. However, this possibility can be ruled out based on the fact that S267M shows WT-like FTIR and EPR spectral features, which suggest that the conformation surrounding the H-cluster remains unaffected by this mutation. Another possibility that the S267M mutation could introduce a specic temperature-dependent instability can be excluded\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Intrigued by this result, we proceeded to inspect whether: (i) S267 is a possible proton transfer residue, andmutating it tomethionine blocks the proton transfer pathway, or (ii) S267 is important for the regulation of the redox potential of the H-cluster and the mutation to methionine disturbs that potential control.\nDoes S267 act as a proton transfer residue?\nProton-transfer is essential in many proteins, including hydrogenases.31 In the protein matrix, proton transfer is mediated either by polar or charged amino acids, or trapped water molecules. Serine is a small polar amino acid, which may participate in proton transfer, however, if mutated to the nonpolar amino acid methionine, this functionality would be lost. In order to check if the residue S267 is indeed involved in proton transfer, this position was further mutated to alanine, aspartic acid and cysteine, thus generating three additional variants S267A, S267D, and S267C. Aer, purication of the apoprotein, these variants were maturated with [2Fe]ADT and their FTIR spectra were recorded. As, shown in Fig. 5, all the variants showed spectra similar to WT-TmHydS and S267M. We anticipated that, if the hydroxyl side chain of serine is critical for proton transfer, the S267A mutant would show lower H2 conversion activity than WT, possibly as low as the S267M variant, while S267C and S267D may retain the ability to transfer protons and show activity comparable to WT-TmHydS. However, as shown in Fig. 5, the H2 oxidation and production activities of the S267A variant are justz 50% lower than that of the WT. The S267D variant shows comparable activity to S267A, and surprisingly the activity of the S267C variant is even lower (z20% of WT). These observations question the role of S267 in the proton-transfer in TmHydS. It is possible that the small CH3 side chain of S267A can accommodate a water molecule, which would compensate for the lack of polar groups.\nDoes S267 inuence the redox potential of the H-cluster?\nThe fact that the S267M variant could not be oxidized by thionine suggested that this mutation has inuenced the redox potential of the H-cluster. In order to determine the redox potential of the H-cluster in this variant, IR spectroelectrochemical titrations were performed. This method is widely used to determine the potential dependence of the redox-states in hydrogenases, as they contain intrinsic IR active probes such as the CN\u2212 and CO ligands in their active site, which are extremely sensitive to electron density changes within the H-cluster. IR spectroelectrochemical experiments were performed by mixing the holoS267M variant with a redox-mediator cocktail, to ensure fast electron transfer and, therefore, shorter equilibrations times. Then, the sample was loaded into a home-made transmission FTIR cell, equipped with a three-electrode system for poising the potential at the desired values.32\nThe reductive titration of holo-S267M commenced at a mildly negative potential (\u2212130 mV, vs. SHE), where the FTIR\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nspectrum of the protein is indistinguishable from that of the HAR-oxidized sample, indicating that the H-cluster is in the Hox state (Fig. 6). As the potential was lowered, the intensities of these FTIR bands decreased, while a new set of bands started to appear from the H*red state. Aer reaching the highest intensities, at z\u2212450 mV vs. SHE, the intensities of these bands decreased as the potential was poised to even more negative values, and new bands appeared from the H*sred state. The intensities of this new set of FTIR bands reached a plateau at z\u2212700 mV vs. SHE. The oxidative titrations showed essentially the same behavior (Fig. S7\u2020).\nThe intensity of the Hox state was possible to extract directly by following the intensity at 1947 cm\u22121. However, due to the fact that the peaks from the H*red and H * sred states overlap, the intensities of the individual components were extracted by tting the region between 1880 cm\u22121 and 1850 cm\u22121 with Gaussian peaks (Fig. S8\u2020) with maxima at 1869 cm\u22121 \u00f0H*red\u00de and 1861 cm\u22121 \u00f0H*sred\u00de.

Sci., 2023, 14, 3682\u20133692\nlonger engage in hydrogen bonding and the redox potential of the cluster becomes more negative, thus it is more difficult to reduce.\nSpectroelectrochemical characterization of S267MPDT variant\nSince the discovery of articial maturation,33,34 [FeFe] hydrogenases were produced with several derivatives of the [2Fe]ADT cofactor to investigate the importance of the chemical properties of the [2Fe]H subcluster.35\u201338 Among these derivatives, the cofactor containing propane-1,3-dithiolate (PDT) instead of ADT, in which the amine head group of the cofactor is replaced with the nonprotonatable methylene group, is used to investigate the role of proton coupled electron transfer in the H-cluster. In our previous study, spectroelectrochemical FTIR analysis of WT TmHydSPDT revealed a unique property of this enzyme, that the H-cluster does not need protonation of the bridging dithiolate ligand for reduction of [2Fe]H.6 This was illustrated by the fact that the oneelectron reduced TmHydSPDT displayed the spectra of both the H*red (reduced [2Fe]H) and Hred (reduced [4Fe\u20134S]H) states, and could be further reduced to theH*sred state. This is in stark contrast to the PDT versions of prototypical hydrogenases, which only show the one-electron reduced Hred state, and cannot be reduced by two electrons.39\u201341 It should be noted that for WT TmHydS, the reason why the Hred state is not observed in the ADT version of the enzyme is that the nitrogen of the ADT ligand is more electron withdrawing than the carbon of the PDT ligand, which gives [2Fe]ADT a more positive redox potential than that of [2Fe]PDT.\nIn order to verify if the S267M variant also maintains this exceptional behavior, we performed an IR spectroelectrochemical titration on the PDT derivate of the S267M variant (S267MPDT). The reductive titration of this variant was carried out in the same way as explained above for S267MADT. At oxidizing potentials, S267MPDT showed FTIR bands similar to the Hox state and, as the potential was decreased below \u2212310 mV, the intensities of these peaks dropped and new peaks started to appear (Fig. 7). The number of FTIR peaks showed that there are at least two states appearing, similar to those observed for WT-TmHydSPDT. The positions of one set of FTIR bands were shied to lower energy relative to the HPDTox state by <10 cm\u22121, while the other set of peaks was shied by >40 cm\u22121 to lower energy, indicating that the rst set of bands belongs to a species where [4Fe\u20134S]H is reduced (the Hred state) while the second species formed is due to the reduction of [2Fe]H (the H*red state). In terms of intensities, these peaks reached their saturation at z\u2212500 mV, and remained stable until z\u2212600 mV, aer which a new set of peaks started to appear, at positions similar to the H*sred state. The oxidative titration showed essentially the same behaviour (Fig. S9\u2020).\nSince there is substantial overlap of the peaks in the Hox and Hred states as well as for the peaks in the H*red and H * sred states, Gaussian peak tting was applied (Fig. S10\u2020). The intensities of the individual components were extracted by tting the region from 1955 cm\u22121 to 1925 cm\u22121 (for Hox/Hred) and 1875 cm\n\u22121 to 1845 cm\u22121 (for H*red and H * sred) using Gaussian peaks with maxima at 1944 cm\u22121 (Hox), 1936 cm \u22121 (Hred), 1862 cm\n\u22121 (H*red) and 1857 cm\u22121 (H*sred).

Overall, S267MPDT, behaved in a way similar to that of WTTmHydSPDT. However, the ratio of the Hred to H*red states is altered such that H*red dominates for S267M PDT, while Hred\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ndominates for WT TmHydSPDT. This indicates a decreased thermodynamic stability of the Hred state in comparison with the H*red state, in agreement with a more negative redox potential for [4Fe\u20134S]H in S267M. Indeed, tting of the data with the Nernst equation showed that the Hox to H*red transition has a redox potential (\u2212450 mV) similar to WT (\u2212460 mV), whereas the Hred to H*sred transition has a more positive potential (\u2212660 mV) than WT (\u2212690 mV), and the Hox to Hred and H*red to H*sred transitions have more negative redox potentials (\u2212480 mV and \u2212690 mV, respectively) thanWT (\u2212440 mV and\u2212670 mV, respectively). The oxidative titrations gave similar values of the potentials (Fig. S9\u2020). The above observations suggest that mutation of S267 may have disrupted the redox-coupling between the two clusters and hence the activity of this variant is signicantly lower than that of WT-TmHydS. Furthermore, electron transfer from [2Fe]H to [4Fe\u20134S]H is less favorable in the S267M variant compared with the WT enzyme, explaining the lower activity and difficulty in oxidizing the variant. It should be noted that the redox potential for the Hox=H*red transition in S267M\nPDT (\u2212450 mV) is 135 mV more negative than the same transition in S267MADT (\u2212315 mV). A similar observation was also made for WT TmHydS,6 and again agrees with the idea that [2Fe]PDT has a more negative redox potential than [2Fe]ADT in TmHydS, and that this is due to the difference in electron withdrawing ability of the bridge-head atom of the dithiolate ligand."

            "text": "In this work, we have explored the inuence of amino acids surrounding the active site H-cluster in a recently discovered group of sensory [FeFe] hydrogenases, including the sensory hydrogenase HydS from Thermotoga maritima. These enzymes are strongly divergent from the well-characterized prototypical hydrogenases and, therefore, provide complementary information toward the understanding of the mechanism of [FeFe] hydrogenases in general. Furthermore, they provide insight on the important factors needed for functioning as efficient biological sensors.\nWe have investigated the function of the secondary coordination sphere amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis, generating seven TmHydS variants. Our results show that changes to the protein environment have only subtle effects on the spectroscopic and catalytic properties in most cases. However, the serine residue present at position 267 plays an important role in TmHydS, and appears to tune the potential of the H-cluster. We suggest that S267 inuences the potential of [4Fe\u20134S]H by stabilizing the reduced state of the cluster. This residue is not conserved in other sensory hydrogenases (HydS), so the question arises if the identity of this amino acid is indeed important for the function of sensory [FeFe] hydrogenases, and why it is not wellconserved? It is possible that the redox potential of the [4Fe\u20134S] cluster regulates the sensory properties of the enzyme and that changing the amino acid at the S267 position can ne-tune the sensory behaviour. A clue here is that oxidation of S267M was more difficult than for WT. This would be expected to make the S267M variant sensitive only at low concentrations of H2. For Thermotoga maritima to appropriately respond to changes in the\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3682\u20133692 | 3689\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

It would be interesting to see whether the H2 concentrations found in various environments correlate with the amino acid at this position in HydS from other bacteria.\nMore generally, our work presents a conundrum: which amino acids form the proton transfer pathway in TmHydS. Originally, we speculated that proton transfer in HydS may have been impeded due to the A131, which is normally occupied by cysteine in prototypical hydrogenases. However, the A131C variant actually had lower activity than WT. Firstly, this result supports the notion of an alternative proton transfer pathway, and, secondly, this suggests that interaction of cysteine with the ADT ligand in A131C HydS may alter the electronic structure of the H-cluster enough to interfere with catalysis. Another amino acid, Y223, located very close to the ADT ligand presents a possible starting point for an alternative proton transfer pathway. However, the Y223F variant lacking the hydroxyl group actually had increased H2 oxidation activity, in contrast to what would be expected for a crucial proton transfer pathway amino acid. S267 presented another possibility, and, at rst, the extremely low activity of the S267M variant suggested a crucial role for this amino acid. However, the S267A variant retained 50% activity and so it seems unlikely that the hydroxyl group of S267 is a crucial proton transfer component. It cannot be excluded that a water molecule can substitute for the hydroxyl group, but it seems more likely that this amino acid does not constitute part of the proton transfer pathway.\nThe idea of alternative proton transfer pathways suggests that their evolution occurred quite late and that for a long time, primitive hydrogenase enzymes were functioning with only rudimentary proton transfer networks, possibly mediated by the diffusion of water to and from the active site. However, the selection pressure for fast and efficient H2 oxidation or proton reduction drove the evolution of highly tuned proton transfer pathways in modern prototypical [FeFe] hydrogenases. More research on diverse groups of [FeFe] hydrogenase is clearly needed to understand the evolution of the proton transfer pathway in more detail.\nOverall, this work highlights the importance of tuning the properties of the two halves of the H-cluster, the [4Fe\u20134S] and [2Fe] subclusters, for enzyme function. In prototypical enzymes it appears to be crucial to maintain a very low redox potential for the [2Fe] subcluster so that it can only become reduced with concomitant protonation of the ADT ligand, ensuring efficient proton-coupled electron transfer. Furthermore, the redox potential for the [4Fe\u20134S] subcluster is close to the thermodynamic 2H+/H2 potential at pH 7 (E = \u2212420 mV vs. SHE). In HydS the [2Fe] subcluster has quite a high redox potential and so it can be reduced without protonation of the ADT ligand. However, in HydS, the redox potential of the [4Fe\u20134S] cluster can be modulated to ne-tune the sensitivity of the H-cluster to H2."
