    "abstractText": "Oxidative stress is closely linked to the etiology of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis. (TMJ-OA) and is an important therapeutic target. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) have been broadly studied owing to their powerful antioxidant properties and potential preventive and therapeutic effects against chronic diseases. The current study was designed to explore the protective effects of CNPs on the progression of TMJ-OA and their potential mechanisms. We detected the ability of CNPs to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chondrocytes. Moreover, their protective effects on chondrocytes were detected in the level of gene and protein. Furthermore, TUNEL assay, histology and safranin O-fast green staining were used to detect the beneficial effects of CNPs on cartilage explants. The mechanism of CNPs, protecting condylar cartilage by reducing inflammation, was further explored by knocking down the Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) gene. CNPs could reduce the ROS levels in chondrocytes and cartilage explants and reverse the IL-1\u03b2-induced imbalance of cartilage matrix metabolism and apoptosis. The protective effects of CNPs on cartilage were lost after key antioxidant factors including Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase 1(HO-1) were significantly reduced. In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway by CNPs might have therapeutic potential for TMJ-OA.",

(TMJ-OA) and is an important therapeutic target. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) have been broadly studied owing to their powerful antioxidant properties and potential preventive and therapeutic effects against chronic diseases. The current study was designed to explore the protective effects of CNPs on the progression of TMJ-OA and their potential mechanisms. We detected the ability of CNPs to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chondrocytes. Moreover, their protective effects on chondrocytes were detected in the level of gene and protein. Furthermore, TUNEL assay, histology and safranin O-fast green staining were used to detect the beneficial effects of CNPs on cartilage explants. The mechanism of CNPs, protecting condylar cartilage by reducing inflammation, was further explored by knocking down the Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) gene. CNPs could reduce the ROS levels in chondrocytes and cartilage explants and reverse the IL-1\u03b2-induced imbalance of cartilage matrix metabolism and apoptosis. The protective effects of CNPs on cartilage were lost after key antioxidant factors including Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase 1(HO-1) were significantly reduced. In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway by CNPs might have therapeutic potential for TMJ-OA.\nKEYWORDS\ncerium oxide nanoparticles, temporomandibular joint, osteoarthritis, oxidative stress, Nrf2/ HO-1 signal pathway, cartilage explant"

            "text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread and increasingly serious joint disease, causing joint pain and disability (Martel-Pelletier et al., 2016). The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a hinge and gliding joint, connecting the mandibular condyle with the temporal articular surface, and is the most common joint affected by OA (Ottria L et al., 2018). TMJ-OA has a similar pathological process as that of other OA joints, including joint pain, synovitis, progressive cartilage degeneration, subchondral bone, and periarticular tissue changes. Due to the complex etiology and unique physiological anatomy of TMJ-OA, effective prevention and treatment remain challenging (Milam, 2005).\nAccording to previous studies, oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of OA. During joint inflammation, the imbalance of intracellular redox occurs, the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a signaling intermediate, further preventing ECM synthesis\u3001cell migration and growth factor bioavailability; activating the matrix metalloproteinases, directly degrading of ECM components; increasing chondrocyte apoptosis and ultimately aggravating the progression of TMJ-OA (Poulet and Beier, 2016; Bolduc et al., 2019). Under normal physiological conditions, the enzyme-dependent and enzyme-independent endogenous antioxidants protect the organism from oxidative damage. However, the excess of free radicals can disrupt the capability of intracellular antioxidant defenses, leading to persistent tissue damage (Gorrini et al., 2013; Poljsak et al., 2013). Nuclear factorerythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) can regulate the cellular antioxidant responses and expression of genes related to the cellular oxidative defense system. In response to oxidative or electrophilic stress, Nrf2 can dissociate from keap1 the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) and activates the transcription of various antioxidant genes, such as heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which are known for their ability to counteract ROS(Alcaraz and Ferr\u00e1ndiz, 2020). A study on experimental arthritis indicated that Nrf2 was a major factor in controlling oxidative stress and joint degradation. Nrf2 deficiency could exacerbate the arthritic process, while the over expression of HO-1 exerted fascinating antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticatabolic effects, and activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway\ndisplays potent protective effects in TMJ-OA chondrocytes and animal models (Jiang et al., 2020). Based on this observation, numerous therapeutic approaches, such as antioxidant supplements, mediators of various ROS pathways, and free radical scavengers, have been used to treat TMJ-OA. Although small molecules, including curcumin and resveratrol have better antioxidant effects, they have poor water solubility, short half-life, unsustainable efficacy, and low bioavailability (Dulbecco and Savarino, 2013; Ren et al., 2021). On the other hand, natural enzymes have inherent limitations, such as high cost, low stability, and storage issues, leading to their unsustainable use (Wu et al., 2019). In addition, the challenges in effective drug delivery and drug release profiles have limited the successful exploration of controlled release systems for some OA drugs (Kavanaugh et al., 2016).\nCurrently, cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) are gaining popularity as inorganic nanomedicines in antioxidant therapy (Saifi et al., 2021). Cerium (Ce), a lanthanide element, is the most abundant among rare-earth elements. Cerium oxide is capable of rapid regenerative redox cycling between the two oxidation states of Ce, Ce3+, and Ce4+, due to the presence of oxygen vacancies in its lattice. This property makes it an interesting material to maintain its powerful catalytic activity in-vivo for a long time, requiring less repeated doses. Moreover, at the nanoscale, the increased surface area to volume ratio and altered quantum lattice of CNPs further enhance their specific redox activity. Due to their excellent anti-oxidation properties, CNPs have attracted considerable attention in biomedical applications. In previous studies, CNPs have shown great potential for the treatment of cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, liver inflammatory disorders, acute kidney injury, radiation-induced tissue damage, retinal disease, and constipation (Montini et al., 2016; Sadidi et al., 2020; Wu and Ta, 2021). However, to the best of our knowledge, studies investigating the effectiveness of CNPs for TMJ-OA are lacking.\nThe current study hypothesized that CNPs could inhibit the TMJOA-induced degeneration of articular cartilage by enhancing the antioxidant function of chondrocytes. Chondrocytes and cartilage explants were exposed to the in-vitro microenvironment of IL-1\u03b2induced TMJ-OA to verify the protective effects of CNPs. Moreover, this study also explored the underlying mechanisms of these protective effects, involving Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways.\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT In TMJ-OA, CNPs could effectively remove ROS in chondrocytes by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and exert excellent antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org02"

            "text": "TMJ-OA is one of the most problematic joint disorders. Condylar cartilage has limited healing ability, owing to the lack of vascular system and nerves; there is no consensus treatment for its complete remission (Liu and Steinkeler, 2013; Okeson, 2013). The efficient intracellular ROS-scavenging ability of CNPs makes them a potential candidate for the treatment of TMJ-OA. Different syntheticmethods have determined the physicochemical properties of CNPs. Studies have also shown that the CNPs with smaller particle sizes are catalytically more active and readily absorbed by cells (Singh et al., 2021; Baldim et al., 2018). The\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org09\npresent study used CNPs of about 5 nm in size and spherical, which could not only effectively scavenge oxygen radicals but also avoided mechanical damage to the cells due to their round and blunt spherical structure. These efficient catalytic activities and safe biocompatibility found the bases for their applications at the cellular level.\nIn order to explore the antioxidant effects of CNPs, an IL-1\u03b2induced inflammatory model was constructed. IL-1\u03b2 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine, which is associated with tissue damage and plays a key role in developing OA by activating the production and secretion of inflammatory as well as OA pathogenesis-associated catabolic factors (Kerkhof et al., 2011). IL-1\u03b2-induced chondrocytes had horrible oxidative stress state and inflammation accompanied by a substantial increase in the intracellular ROS levels and a decrease in the expression levels of key antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, CAT, and GPx, while seriously causing the imbalance of intracellular redox status. In addition, the chondrocyte supernatant contained abnormally high NO contents, which is a highly reactive free radical and a classical proinflammatory factor. NO is a major inducer of chondrocyte apoptosis, and its higher concentrations have detrimental effects on chondrocyte function, thereby further exacerbating inflammatory response in the joint (Abramson et al., 2001). Due to the strong correlations between oxidative stress and inflammation, the treatment, targeting oxidative stress, might alleviate inflammation (Mittal et al., 2014; Reuter et al., 2010). A previous study reported that CNPs could alleviate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit the recruitment of macrophages in edema and allergy (Kim et al., 2021). Serebrovska et al. (2017) observed that CNPs could inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a rat pneumonia model, thereby showing potential antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects. Similarly, the current study\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org10\nshowed that CNPs could reduce the expression levels of proinflammatory factors by scavenging the free radicals and restoring cellular redox homeostasis, thereby alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation-induced damage to the cartilage tissues. In addition to inflammation, disturbance in the metabolism of the ECM might also contribute to cartilage destruction. An imbalance between catabolism and anabolism can lead to the loss of the cartilage matrix, which is a hallmark of cartilage deficiency, damage, and degeneration (Zheng et al., 2021; Speziali et al., 2015). The localized high ROS levels in chondrocytes are involved in cartilage matrix-degradation by inhibiting matrix formation, and/or inducing ECM degradation and expression of matrix-degrading enzymes (MMPs and ADAMTS) (Sun et al., 2021; Pan et al., 2019). In this study, CNPs could prevent joint destruction by eliminating the elevated levels of ROS, which placed chondrocytes in a gentle environment and promoted the synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen while reducing the expression levels of matrix-degrading enzymes. Moreover, the condylar cartilage of TMJ is fibrous, containing Collagen I and Collagen II, unlike the hyaline cartilage of the knee joint, which contains only Collagen II. This difference in composition allows the covering of condylar cartilage by a large number of dense collagen fibers with a higher surface roughness (Stocum and Roberts, 2018; Armiento et al., 2019). Therefore, the type of cartilage synthesis should be focused on to control OA. Surprisingly, the present study indicated that CNPs could increase the expression levels of Collagen I and Collagen II at both the mRNA and protein levels, thereby demonstrating the possibility of regenerating condylar fibrocartilage. This might also compensate for the lack of ECM cartilage protection by increasing only the expression of Collagen II. These experiments demonstrated that CNPs could be a promising antioxidant for the treatment of TMJ-OA; however, the underlying mechanisms required further exploration. Previously, it was suggested\nFIGURE 7 Antioxidant and chondroprotective effects of CNPs on IL-1\u03b2-stimulated condylar cartilage explants. (A) Apoptosis was shown by TUNEL assay after the pretreatment of cartilage explants with IL-1\u03b2 stimulation and CNPs for 1 week.

Therefore, the interactions between CNPs and biological system components, that affect cellular behavior, should be explored. Various studies suggested that Nrf2 was a major factor regulating oxidative stress and joint degradation, and the activation of Nrf2 and the HO-1 signaling pathway was critical for maintaining the chondrocyte homeostasis and cartilage integrity (Marchev et al., 2017). Surprisingly, the current study showed that CNPs alone could activate the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1, significantly reverse the IL-1\u03b2-induced decrease in the expression levels of key antioxidant genes (Nrf2 and HO1), and subsequently inhibit the expression of genes encoding downstream detoxification enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) in chondrocytes. Similarly, immunofluorescence results showed that CNPs could significantly promote the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus, an essential step in gene-inducing and cytoprotective function. Therefore, it was speculated that the protective effects of CNPs on cartilage might be related to the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Based on these observations, the Nrf2-knockdown model was established in chondrocytes. The result showed that the Nrf2-knockdown could significantly reduce the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression levels, and relentlessly eliminate the protective effect of CNPs on TMJ OA chondrocytes in the inflammatory environment. This provided strong evidence for the involvement of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Although the present study verified that activating Nrf2 was the main reason for the protective effects of CNPs in TMJ-OA, the role of CNPs in eliminating ROS through catalytic reactions and synergistically resisting oxidative stress in chondrocytes by activating endogenous antioxidant systems could also not be denied. Anyway, this was the first study to demonstrate that CNPs could protect chondrocytes and cartilage explants from the inflammation-induced oxidative stress in TMJ-OA by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.\nThis study evaluated the chondroprotective properties of CNPs on IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cartilage explants in a three-dimensional orientation. The CNPs treatment could significantly reduce the number of free radicals in the culture medium and visual cartilage breakage-related factors, including the number of apoptotic chondrocytes, disorganization of tissue structure, and substantial loss of proteoglycans from the cartilage matrix. Mutual validation of the chondrocyte and cartilage explant parts of the experiment, and the beneficial effect of CNPs on TMJ OA was futher confirmed.\nFuture studies should focus on finding the duration of the antioxidant effects of CNPs and maintaining the appropriate level of Nrf2/HO-1 activity in order to prevent the imbalance between intracellular ROS and antioxidants caused by the continuous downregulation of antioxidant capacity."
