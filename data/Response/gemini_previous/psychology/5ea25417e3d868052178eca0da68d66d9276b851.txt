1. **Investigate the mechanism of action of FNZ against G+ bacteria.** This could be done by studying the interaction of FNZ with bacterial membranes, as well as the effects of FNZ on bacterial cell viability and metabolism. This information could help to identify new targets for antimicrobial therapy.
2. **Explore the potential of FNZ as a synergistic agent with other antibiotics.** FNZ was shown to have synergistic effects with several traditional antibiotics, including ampicillin, kanamycin, and vancomycin. Further studies could investigate the mechanisms of these synergistic interactions and explore the potential of FNZ as a combination therapy for antibiotic-resistant infections.
3. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of FNZ against G+ bacterial infections.** Animal models of G+ bacterial infections could be used to assess the efficacy of FNZ in treating these infections. This information would be important for determining the potential of FNZ as a new therapeutic agent for G+ bacterial infections.
4. **Investigate the potential of FNZ for use in topical applications.** FNZ could be formulated into a topical cream or ointment for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections. This could be a valuable new option for the treatment of these infections, which are often caused by G+ bacteria.
5. **Explore the potential of FNZ for use in the development of new antimicrobial materials.** FNZ could be incorporated into materials such as textiles, medical devices, and food packaging to inhibit the growth of G+ bacteria. This could help to reduce the spread of infection and improve public health.
