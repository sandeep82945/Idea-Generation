    "abstractText": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by amyloid-beta aggregation and neurofibrillary tangles. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) hydrolyses acetylcholine and induces amyloid-beta aggregation. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) inhibit this aggregation by binding to AChE, making it a potential target for the treatment of AD. In this study, we have focused on the identification of potent and safe AChEI from the Comprehensive Marine Natural Product Database (CMNPD) using computational tools. For the screening of CMNPD, a structure-based pharmacophore model was generated using a structure of AChE complexed with the co-crystallized ligand galantamine (PDB ID: 4EY6). The 330 molecules that passed through the pharmacophore filter were retrieved, their drug-likeness was determined, and they were then subjected to molecular docking studies. The top ten molecules were selected depending upon their docking score and were submitted for toxicity profiling. Based on these studies, molecule 64 (CMNPD8714) was found to be the safest and was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. This molecule showed stable hydrogen bonding and stacked interactions with TYR341, mediated through a water bridge. In silico results can be correlated with in vitro studies for checking its activity and safety in the future.",

            "text": "Dementia refers to a health condition which causes deterioration in cognitive functions, impacting memory, thinking, reasoning skills, and the performance of daily activities. Dementia mainly affects elderly people. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 55.2 million people are currently living with dementia. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, contributing to around 60\u201370% of cases [1]. The disease is characterized by a progressive decline in cognition and memory, and behavioral manifestations. According to the National Institute of Aging (NIA), AD symptoms include memory loss, poor judgement, loss of spontaneity, wandering and getting lost, misplacing or losing things, increased anxiety and aggression, withdrawal from social activities, difficulty in carrying out familiar tasks, etc. [2]. The important pathological hallmarks of AD include accumulation of amyloid plaques, formation of neurofibrillary tangles, loss of neuronal and synaptic functions, astrogliosis, and microglial cell activation [3]. AD treatments are broadly classified depending upon their nature, i.e., diseasemodifying therapies and symptomatic therapies. Drug targets for disease-modifying therapies include (A) modulation of A\u03b2 (amyloid-beta) production via alpha-secretase\nLife 2023, 13, 1298. https://doi.org/10.3390/life13061298 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/life\nLife 2023, 13, 1298 2 of 16\nenhancement, beta-secretase inhibition, gamma-secretase inhibition, and gamma-secretase modulation; (B) A\u03b2 degradation via neprilysin activation and insulin-degrading enzyme activation; (C) A\u03b2 removal via receptors, vaccination, passive immunization and prevention of entry from periphery; (D) prevention of A\u03b2 toxicity via prevention of aggregation by binding to A\u03b2 and prevention of oligomerization of amyloid protein; and (E) prevention of tau aggregation and hyperphosphorylation [4]. Recently, the United States-Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) has approved two drugs (monoclonal antibodies)\u2014Aducanumab and Lecanemab\u2014for the treatment for AD, which act as diseasemodifying agents by reducing A\u03b2 plaques in the brain and ultimately slow down disease progression [5,6]. On the contrary, drug targets for symptomatic treatments for AD include (A) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, (B) N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulation, (C) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation, (D) gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor blockade, (E) serotonin receptor activation and blockade, (F) histamine H3 receptor blockade, and (G) phosphodiesterase inhibition [4]. In order to treat the symptoms of AD, donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine have been approved by the US-FDA and are currently in use [7]. AD-35 is another potential drug candidate under clinical trials, exhibiting acetylcholinesterase inhibition [8]. A comparison of disease-modifying therapies and symptomatic treatments shows that the failure rate of disease-modifying agents is comparatively high. Reasons underlying this include insufficient understanding of AD pathophysiology, inappropriate drug doses, and unresponsiveness towards monotherapy treatments owing to the complex pathophysiology of AD. Several examples of disease-modifying agents that failed in phase 3 clinical trials are Semagecestat and Avagacestat (gamma-secretase inhibitors); Lanabecestat, Verubecestat, and Atabecestat (BACE1 inhibitors); and Bapinezumab and Solanezumab (monoclonal antibodies). Some of these agents were reported to worsen daily functioning and even increased the rate of progression of disease [9]. Hence, the search for novel therapies to prevent and treat Alzheimer\u2019s is gaining importance. Acetylcholine (ACh) is the most consistent neurotransmitter secreted by cholinergic neurons and plays a major role in neurotransmission involved in memory and learning. The main function of AChE is the breakdown of ACh at cholinergic synapses [10]. Some evidence suggests a role for AChE in the formation of A\u03b2 aggregates. A\u03b2 is a 28\u201343-residue peptide fragment derived from a highly hydrophobic domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP). AChE is reported to form a stable complex with A\u03b2 plaques and hence researchers have suggested its involvement in the induction of fibril formation [11]. In addition to this, as per the cholinergic hypothesis, AD is marked by loss of cholinergic neurons, and alterations in ACh-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and AChE. This loss results in downregulation of acetylcholine levels leading to decreased cholinergic neurotransmission. Owing to its important role in the regulation of cholinergic neurotransmission and the induction of A\u03b2 aggregation, AChE is one of the viable targets for the improvement in AD symptoms. Treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) in AD increases the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain by reversing the cholinergic deficit, eventually resulting in increased signal transduction and improved cholinergic function. They also help in delaying memory loss and managing day-to-day activities [10,12]. A\u03b2 aggregation is also supposed to be suppressed by treatment with AChEI [13]. Currently, available drug treatments for mild to moderate AD which target AChE exert several side-effects, such as nausea, diarrhoea, dizziness, weight loss, abdominal pain, anorexia, and vomiting [14]. Hence, researchers are looking for more effective drugs with maximum efficacy and minimum side effects. In this experiment we have mainly focused on the inhibition of AChE-induced A\u03b2 aggregation by targeting AChE. Natural compounds possessing AChE-inhibiting potential can also be used as AChEI, owing to their safety as compared to synthetic molecules. One such example is galantamine, obtained from Galanthus woronowii. Galantamine was approved by the US-FDA in 2001 and is currently used for the treatment of AD [15]. Many studies are nowadays performed to\nLife 2023, 13, 1298 3 of 16\ncheck the potential of natural compounds such as rutin, quercetin, etc., for the treatment of AD [16,17]. Molecular docking is a computational drug design approach widely employed in lead discovery because it reduces both the time and cost of the discovery process. In this approach, ligand\u2013receptor interactions are studied with the help of computer software. The docking system is based on scoring functions that indicate the binding energy of the ligands when bound to their receptors. Our work aims to perform a virtual screening of the Comprehensive Marine Natural Product Database (CMNPD) against AChE binding sites. Several marine natural products are reported to possess various biological properties.

            "text": "The crystal structure of recombinant human acetylcholinesterase in complex with galantamine (PDB ID: 4EY6) was used to generate a structure-based pharmacophore model. The CMNPD library was screened using the generated pharmacophore filter, and compounds that passed through the filter were retrieved from the same database. The selected molecules were then subjected to ADME predictions. Molecular docking analysis of the compounds possessing drug-like properties was performed using AutoDock Tools. The top ten molecules, based upon their docking scores, were selected, and subjected to virtual toxicity testing. Molecule 64 (CMNPD 8741) had the most negligible toxic dose (4000 mg/kg) and was studied using MD simulations. MD studies and DFT calculations confirmed that molecule 64 is stable and confirmed it as a hit compound. According to the ADME studies, this molecule contains a greater number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors than the standard drug donepezil. The molecule had a similar bioavailability and GI absorption pattern to donepezil, features of great importance in drug design. Molecule 64 exhibited a lower docking score (\u221211.1 kcal/mol) with AChE than donepezil (\u221210.4 kcal/mol). Molecular docking studies suggested that the stacked interaction and hydrogen bonding of this molecule with TYR341 made it stable. Molecule 64 is a bioactive compound known as \u03b4-Indomycinone, that belongs to the family of anthraquinones and is isolated from marine Streptomyces sp. \u03b4-Indomycinone is a new member of the pluramycin class of antibiotics [30]. Indomycinones are generally said to possess anticancer, antibacterial and antiviral properties [31]. In vitro toxicity testing and AChE inhibition studies of the hit molecule are required to further confirm its potential application for the treatment of AD. Therefore, in order to carry out in vitro studies in the future, \u03b4-Indomycinone will be chemically synthesized by the Diels-Alder reaction, using bromonaphthoquinone and 1-methoxy-3-methyl1-trimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadiene as a starting material [31]. The AChE inhibition activity of the chemically synthesized \u03b4-Indomycinone will be assessed by performing Ellman\u2019s colorimetric assay, where the effect of the compound on AChE activity is determined by measuring the intensity of the yellow color that is produced from thiocholine when it reacts\nLife 2023, 13, 1298 15 of 16\nwith dithiobisnitrobenzoate ions [32]. Any reduction in A\u03b2 aggregation in response to treatment with \u03b4-Indomycinone can be tested using the Thioflavin S (ThS) fluorescence assay. This assay measures changes in the fluorescence intensity of ThS, which depends upon the presence of A\u03b2 [33]. The suggested studies will further support our conclusion from the virtual screening of marine natural compounds, and the AChE inhibition potential of molecule 64 will be confirmed. This study opens a new avenue and suggests the exploratory potential of Indomycinones for their various pharmacological actions. The pharmacological potential of many such compounds that have already been reported are yet to be discovered. This is possible by performing virtual screening of such compounds reported in available libraries and datasets.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/life13061298/s1, Figures S1\u2013S10: Interactions of top 10 molecules with AChE.
