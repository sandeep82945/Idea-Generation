    "abstractText": "A new Populus variety with a strong salt tolerance was obtained from cross breeding P. talassica as the female parent and P. euphratica as the male parent. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism and find out the major differentially expressed genes of salt tolerance of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica, after being subjected to salt stress, at 0, 200, and 400 mmol/L NaCl, the root, stem, and leaf transcriptomes (denoted as R0, S0, and L0; R200, S200, and L200; and R400, S400, and L400, respectively) of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica were sequenced. In total, 41,617 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in all the comparison groups with 21,603 differentially upregulated genes and 20,014 differentially downregulated genes. Gene Ontology analysis showed that DEGs were significantly enriched in biological processes that may be involved in salt stress, such as \u2018cell communication\u2019, \u2018ion transport\u2019, \u2018signaling\u2019, and signal \u2018transmission\u2019. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in pathways of \u2018plant\u2013 pathogen interaction\u2019, \u2018carbon metabolism\u2019, and \u2018plant hormone signal transmission\u2019. The pathways and related gene information formed a basis for future research on the mechanisms of salt stress, the development of molecular markers, and the cloning of key genes in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica.",

            "text": "Soil salinization is a main challenge hindering global food security and environmental sustainability. The harmful effects of climate change have accelerated the development of soil salinity [1]. Low precipitation, high surface evaporation, weathering of primary rocks, and irrigation with brine are the main reasons for the increase in salinity [2]. Soil salinization poses multiple hazards to crops. Salt stress causes physiological and metabolic crop disorders, such as decreased photosynthetic efficiency, increased respiration, blocked protein synthesis, accumulation of toxic substances, and accelerated aging and death [3]. Due to frequent drought, irregular precipitation, increasing salinization, and high temperature, climate change has altered many ecosystems. These environmental changes have also led to a decline in crop yields worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need to fully understand the response mechanisms of plants to abiotic stress and use the acquired knowledge to improve their stress resistance [4]. Saline soil mainly contains Na+ and Cl\u2212 [5]. Plants grown in saline soil can regulate the absorption of Na+ and Cl\u2212 to avoid ionic toxicity and ensure that there is enough solute to regulate permeability [6]. To survive in these areas, plants need to produce complex responses to these abiotic stressors, including signal transduction, gene expression regulation, ion homeostasis, reactive oxygen species clearance, compatible solute accumulation,\nGenes 2022, 13, 1032. https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13061032 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes\nGenes 2022, 13, 1032 2 of 28\nand growth regulation [7\u201311]. Plants produce large numbers of transduction signals under salt stress conditions, including ion, osmotic, and detoxification signals. In addition, the sucrose and starch catabolic process in plants is strengthened. The decomposed sugars provide energy for plant growth and development, and the resulting small molecular monosaccharides increase the soluble sugar contents of cells and the osmotic potential of cells, which aid in resisting the osmotic stress caused by high salt ion concentrations [12]. In crops, salt not only affects osmotic stress, it also affects ion stress, and secondary stresses, such as oxidative stress, also occur [13]. Abiotic stresses trigger a series of plant responses, starting from stress perception, leading to the activation of signal pathways and changes in gene expression levels, thereby altering plant physiology, growth, and development [14]. Salt stress affects all the stages of plant growth and development (such as seed germination, growth, flowering, and fruiting) and all the processes of physiological metabolism (such as water metabolism, photosynthesis, and enzyme system metabolism), which leads to declines in crop yield and quality, and even crop failure in serious cases. The responses of plants to salt stress include a series of changes at the molecular, biochemical, and physiological levels. Salt stress leads to the destruction of intracellular homeostasis and ion distribution, as well as the denaturation of structural and functional proteins [15]. To improve the salt tolerance of plants, it is necessary to understand the salt tolerance mechanisms of plant growth and physiology, as well as the salt tolerance mechanisms at the whole-plant, organelle, and molecular levels [16]. Under salt stress conditions, the gene expression pattern changes, and special genes related to salt stress are activated [15]. Identifying genes that enable plants to adapt to, or tolerate, salt stress is key for breeding programs. It is particularly urgent and important to improve the utilization rates of salinized land resources, ensure ecological security, and achieve high quality crops with high yields. This may be achieved by studying the mechanisms of plant salt tolerance and cultivating salt-tolerant plant varieties. To develop more salt-tolerant crops effectively, the genetic mechanisms of salt tolerance must be determined. Salt stress changes gene expression in tissue-specific and timedependent manners. Identifying transcripts associated with salt stress is the first step in detecting genes that contribute to plant salt tolerance. The structural analysis of isolated genes will provide clues to the elements controlling their expression [5]. Identifying the key genes involved in the reproductive physiology of halophytes and using them to transform crops is a promising method for the development of saline agriculture [17]. Previous studies have shown that plant salt tolerance involves multiple genes and is coordinated by multiple mechanisms [18]. The genes related to salt stress response involve ion transport, cell defense, physiological metabolism, cell growth, and many other pathways. These genes work together to resist salt stress in different ways, such as encoding genes related to photosynthesis, osmotic regulation, free radical scavenging enzymes, and vacuole regionalizing enzymes [19]. The use of salinized land for crop cultivation and production has become an important factor for agricultural development [3,19]. Improving the utilization of saline alkali land requires the application of biological improvement methods to increase land-use efficiency [20]. To date, numerous genetic-improvement-related investigations of crop plants have been conducted to elucidate changes in species at the transcriptome level in response to salt stress. The studied plants include Arabidopsis [21], rice [22], peanut [23], sugar beet [24], cotton [25], citrus [26], Clerodendrum inerme (L.) [27], Microalgae Dunaliella [28], kenaf [29], and wild barley [30]. P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica is a new variety obtained by cross breeding P. talassica Kom. as the female parent and P. euphratica Oliv. as the male parent. In addition to the excellent characteristics of cold resistance, drought resistance, saline alkali resistance, barren resistance, and wind and sand resistance for P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica, it also has the characteristics of strong asexual reproductive ability, fast growth speed, strong growth potential, good material quality, high cutting survival rate, and strong adaptability. It is an excellent tree species for wind prevention and sand control afforestation in arid, saline\nGenes 2022, 13, 1032 3 of 28\nalkali, and desert areas. At present, although some research progress has been made in salt-tolerance-related gene mining and in understanding the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in other crops, research on the salt tolerance of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica remains at the morphological and physiological levels. The related molecular mechanisms are still unclear, and there is limited research on transcriptome analysis of different tissues in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica under salt stress conditions. In recent years, high-throughput sequencing technologies have been used to study gene function and gene structure at the overall level, and it has revealed the molecular mechanisms of specific biological and physiological processes. Among these technologies, a transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) is a collection of all the transcripts produced by a species or specific cell type, and it has been widely used in many fields, such as basic research, physiological mechanisms, and clinical diagnoses [31]. Therefore, RNA-seq is a cost-effective platform for analyzing gene expression [32\u201334]. However, the differences in the salt tolerance mechanisms of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica and the elucidation of genes that play major roles in these mechanisms are limited, due to the lack of transcriptome information. To explore the unique salt tolerance mechanisms of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica and explore its key genes in response to salt stress, this study applied RNA-seq technology for root, stem, and leaf tissues of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica under salt stress conditions. After transcriptome analysis of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica under salt stress conditions were performed, the differentially expressed genes under these conditions were excavated, and pathways related to the salt stress responses of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica were identified. Understanding the salt tolerance mechanisms of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica at the molecular level will not only provide a valuable resource for future research and breeding [35] but will also help to promote the planting of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica in saline alkali land and provide a reference for the improvement and sustainable development and utilization of soil saline alkali land in Xinjiang in the future."

Three NaCl concentration levels were used\u20140, 200, and 400 mmol/L. P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica with the same growth trends and good growth were selected and they were divided into three groups of three plants each. The salt treatment group was treated with NaCl solution once every three days, and the control group was irrigated with 1000 mL deionized water once every three days. Both the control and the salt treatment groups were treated for a total of five times. In order to avoid the salt shock effect, the potted P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica seedlings were treated with salt stress in the way of increasing salt concentration until the predetermined concentration.

RNA was extracted from tissues or cells using the TRIzol extraction method, followed by the rigorous quality control of the RNA samples using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer and the accurate detection of RNA integrity. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using an M-MuLV reverse transcriptase system with an mRNA fragment as template and a random oligonucleotide as primer. Subsequently, the RNA strand was degraded by RNaseH, and the second-strand cDNA was synthesized with dNTPs in a DNA Polymerase I system. The purified double-stranded cDNA was repaired at the end, A tails were added, and sequencing joints were connected. Approximately 250\u2013300-bp cDNA was screened using AMPure XP Beads for PCR amplification, and PCR products were purified again with AMPure XP beads to finally obtain libraries [36]. After the library was constructed, a Qubit2.0 Fluorometer was used for initial quantification, and the library was diluted to 1.5 ng/\u00b5L. An Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer was then used to determine the insert size of the library, and qRT-PCR was used to accurately quantify the effective library concentration (Effective library concentration is higher than 2 nM) to ensure the library quality. After qualified library inspection, Illumina sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 after pooling different libraries in accordance with the effective concentration and the targeted offline data requirements. The basic principle of this sequencing technology was sequencing by synthesis. In the sequencing flow cell, there were four kinds of fluorescence-labeled dNTPs, amplification primers, and DNA polymerase. In each sequence complementary chain cluster, when a fluorescently labeled dNTP was added to the chain, it released the corresponding fluorescence, which was captured by Illumina HiSeq 2500 and converted from optical signals into sequencing peaks by computer software. In this manner, the sequence information of the fragment to be tested was obtained [37\u201339]."

This part of the analysis was performed using the featureCounts tool in subread software [42]. A quantitative analysis of the gene expression level was carried out for each sample, and then the expression matrix of all the samples was obtained [43]. Due to the influence of sequencing depth and gene length, RNA-seq expression values are generally not expressed by read count, but by FPKM, which is used to correct sequencing depth and gene length successively [44]. After the expression values of all the genes in each sample were calculated, the distributions of gene expression levels in different samples were displayed using box graphs. After gene expression quantification, the expression data\nGenes 2022, 13, 1032 5 of 28\nwere statistically analyzed to screen for genes with significant differences in expression level under different conditions. The difference analysis was divided into three steps. The original read count was first standardized, mainly to correct for the sequencing depth. Then, the statistical model calculated the probability of hypothesis testing (p-value), and finally, multiple hypothesis testing correction was conducted to obtain false discovery rate values (error detection rate, padj) [45\u201347]. Transcriptome analyses are conducted on thousands of genes, which leads to the accumulation of false positives. The greater the number of genes, the greater the accumulation of false positives in the hypothesis testing. Therefore, padj was introduced to correct the p-value of the hypothesis testing to control the proportion of false positives [48]. Differences in gene screening standards are very important, we used the standard |log2 (fold change)| \u2265 1 and padj \u2264 0.05 as common values."

The KEGG database integrates genomic, chemical, and system functional information [52,53]. Enrichment analysis was based on the principle of hypergeometric distribution, in which the differential gene set was the gene set obtained from the differential significant analysis and annotated in the GO or KEGG database.

            "text": "Using the locational information from the gene alignment on the reference genome of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica, the number of reads covering each gene (including the newly predicted genes) from start to end was calculated. Reads with a comparison quality value of less than 10, unpaired reads, and reads to multiple regions of the genome were filtered. This part of the analysis used the featureCounts tool in the subread software [42]. Then, HISAT2 (Version 2.0.4) software (http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/ (accessed o 3 October 2021)) was used to compare th obtained high-q ality clean reads to the reference g nome of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica, and StringTie software (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/ (accessed on 3 October 2021)) was used to perform a quantitative expression analysis of each sample gene [57]. After all the gene expression values (FPKM) of the 27 samples were calculated, the distribution of gene expression levels among samples was determined, as shown in Figure 1. The gene expression distribution of all samples in each treatment group of root, stem, and leaf can be clearly seen from Figure 1A.\nFigure 1. uantitative analysis of gene expression. (A) Distribution box plot of gene expression levels in different samples. (B) Density distribution diagram of FPKM values. (C) Correlation heat map. (D) PCA diagram of samples.\n3.3.2. FPKM Density Distribution\nGenerally speaking, the number of DEGs only accounts for a small part of the whole gene, and a few differentially expressed genes have little influence on the distribution of the expression level of a sample. In most cases, samples have similar distributions of expression levels. For the gene expression level of each sample, the logarithm base 2 was used to construct the density distribution map, as shown in Figure 1B. The abscissa represents log2 (FPKM + 1) values, and the ordinate represents the gene distribution density of the\nGenes 2022, 13, 1032 10 of 28\ncorresponding expression quantity. Thus, they reflect the distribution of gene FPKM and the proportions of genes with different expression levels in all the samples. Each color in the figure represents a sample, the sum of all probabilities is 1, and the area of each region is 1. The peak of the density curve represents the region with the highest concentration of gene expression in the whole sample. In the data, there were different peaks, but the proportions of gene expression at different peaks and the trend of density distribution curves of different samples were relatively consistent because the distribution of the gene expression density in the same tissue of the same species was similar [58].\n3.3.3. Correlation Analysis between Samples\nInter-sample correlation, intragroup biological repeatability, and intergroup sample differences were evaluated. The correlation of gene expression levels among samples represents an important index to determine the reliability of experiments and the rationality of sample selection. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the greater the similarity in the expression patterns between samples. In accordance with the FPKM values of all the genes in each sample, the correlation coefficients of samples within and between groups were calculated, and a heat map was constructed that can visually display the sample differences between groups and the sample repetition within groups. The higher the correlation coefficient between samples, the closer the expression pattern. The sample correlation heat map is shown in Figure 1C. The left and upper sides are sample clustering, the right and lower sides are sample names, and the squares of different colors represent the correlations of the two samples. In Figure 1C, the correlation coefficient of the three biological replicates for each salt concentration treatment was close to 1, which showed that the data of the three biological replicates at each salt treatment were very good, and the correlations within and between groups were good. Thus, they can be used for subsequent experiments. A principal component analysis (PCA) is an algorithm that reduces data dimensions. It is a way to evaluate the quality of biological duplications. It is used to evaluate the biological repeatability of samples within a group and the differences between groups. On the basis of a data matrix of gene expression in the sample, it is mapped to the twodimensional plane to obtain the principal component (PC) with the greatest contribution to the different genes. In the transcriptome, each sample contains thousands of genes. The FPKM values of these genes were calculated, and a PCA was used to reduce the dimension of the overall data. The distance between the midpoint in Figure 1D represents the degree of similarity between samples. PC1 refers to the contribution rate ranking first, which is the factor that has the greatest impact on the amount of variation. PC2 is the factor ranking second. As shown in Figure 1D, the abscissa was PC1, and the ordinate was PC2. As shown in the PCA cluster diagram of Figure 1D, the correlations of the three biological repeats in the R0 and L0 treatment groups were low, and the difference between groups was obvious. The three biological repeats in other groups, such as L200, L400, S0, S200, S400, R200, and R400, gathered together. The PC1 and PC2 of the three biological repeats were very close, the correlations were high, and the difference between groups was not obvious, indicating that the samples were very similar."

Trend Analysis To further provide a global expression profile of uniquely assembled transcripts un-\nder salt stress conditions, expression models of all the DEGs were created and divided into four clusters on the basis of a log2(fold change). Cluster is the cluster number after clustering according to the expression mode. As shown in Figure 6, the change trend of the expression of all the genes related to stress treatment was analyzed. The change characteristics of the same gene in a changing trend were determined to identify the most representative change process of a genetic group, as shown in Figure 6. Each square represents a kind of trend in the gene expression data. In Figure 6, the abscissa has the names of the different tissue samples, and the ordinate represents the value under the sample after Z-score homogenization of gene FPKM value in the sample. The gray line in each subplot represents the relative corrected gene expression levels of genes in a cluster under different experimental conditions, and and the blue line represents the average value of the relative corrected gene expression levels of all genes in this cluster under different experimental conditions. As shown in Figure 6, we can see the change trend of all gene expression levels after relative correction under different experimental conditions. Comprehensive analysis, it can be seen that the expression of most DEGs in sub_cluster (1\u20134) were up-regulated after salt stress exposure.\nFigure 5.

In is study, the salt tolerance of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica under different salt concentrations was comprehensively analyzed by using RNA-seq. Results revealed that the DEGs in roots, stems, and leaves had distinct expression patterns. The following findings hold valid: the total number of DEGs in stems > the total number of DEGs in leaves > the total number of DEGs in roots. The reason is because under salt stress, DEGs with distinct expression patterns amongst roots, stems, and leaves were ideal targets for further functional research to better understand the more specific molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance [62].\nGenes 2022, 13, 1032 22 of 28\nBy screening the expression levels of DEGs, the possible salt tolerance genes in the roots, stems, and leaves of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica were further explored.

Plants often activate an array of defense responses in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, including inducible expression of a set of stress-related genes that are regulated directly or indirectly by various types of transcription factors [65]. Several classes of transcription factors, including AP2/ERF, bZIP, NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC), and WRKY, are reported to be associated with plant defense [66\u201369]. NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) domain proteins are plant-specific transcriptional factors that play diverse roles in plant growth and development [70,71]. NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factors are also involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress processes, including high salt [72], drought [73], freezing [74], and viral infection [75]. NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) plant transcription factors regulate essential processes in development, stress responses, and nutrient distribution in important crop and model plants (rice, Populus, Arabidopsis), making them crucial in crop improvement and production [76]. The AP2/ERF transcription factors are known to regulate diverse processes of plant development and stress responses. In addition, AP2/ERF transcription factors are ideal candidates for crop growth, development, and improvement because their overexpression enhances tolerances to drought and salt stress in the transgenic plants [77]. Various AP2/ERF transcription factors have been successfully identified and investigated in some plants, including Arabidopsis, rice [78,79], poplar (P. tricocarpa) [80], and wheat (Triticum aestivum) [81]. WRKY transcription factors, a family of regulatory genes, were first identified in plants [82\u201384]. Numerous WRKY transcription factors are key regulators of many plant processes, including the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, senescence, seed dormancy, and seed germination [85]. A large number of WRKY transcription factors have been reported from Arabidopsis, rice, and other higher plants [86]. The Populus genome contains at least 100 WRKY genes [87]. Increasing evidence has confirmed the importance of WRKY transcription factors in poplar defense processes, and several poplar WRKY genes have been identified to be involved in defense response [88]. The bZIP transcription factor gene family is one of the largest and most diverse families in plants. The bZIP proteins regulate numerous growth and developmental processes [89]. They are also involved in responses to various abiotic/biotic stimuli, such as drought [90,91] and high salinity [77]. Some of these bZIP factors confer disease resistance [92] and trigger expression of defense-related genes in systemic acquired resistance (SAR) [93]. bZIP-type transcriptional factors are involved in developmental and physiological processes in response to stresses and are important for various plants to withstand adverse environmental conditions [94,95].\nGenes 2022, 13, 1032 23 of 28\nStress-resistant transcription factors, such as AP2/ERF, NAC (NAM, ATA, and CUC), WRKY, and bZIP, are all involved in the detection of early salt stress in poplars and other plants. The analysis found that these differential genes with high expression in the roots, stems, and leaves of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica also existed in its male parent P. euphratica. These genes are likely to be the key salt-tolerant genes that exist in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica to resist external salt stress. In the future, the functions of these genes in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica and other tree species should be further analyzed to provide some reference for the planting of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica in saline-alkali land. GO enrichment analysis showed that many DEGs were related to \u2018material metabolism\u2019, \u2018signal transmission\u2019, and other processes, which was consistent with the annotation results of Reaumuria trigyna [96]. The genes involved in the above processes, such as \u2018signal transmission\u2019, \u2018ion transport\u2019, \u2018cell communication\u2019, \u2018cell periphery\u2019, and \u2018cell wall\u2019, may be involved in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica responses to salt stress. Salt stress disturbs the normal growth and development of plants. Modifications of the cell wall are common defense responses when plants are subjected to abiotic and biotic stresses. In our study, most of the genes related to cell wall and growth were upregulated under salt stress conditions [97]. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly enriched in \u2018plant hormone signal transduction\u2019 and \u2018MAPK-signaling pathway\u2013plant\u2019, which were highly annotated, may be involved in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica responses to salt stress. This is similar to the research results of Zhan Jiang Han et al. [58]. For plants under abiotic or biotic stress, signal transduction is very crucial for adjustment in such unfavorable conditions [98\u2013101]. Plants respond to abiotic stresses by regulating complex signaling networks, helping plants adapt to stress and thus enhancing their growth and development [102]. Furthermore, hormone signal transduction is involved in plant growth regulation and root development under salt stress conditions [103]. KEGG-enriched pathways of these DEGs were similar, and P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica may have a special response mechanism to salt stress. Through GO functional enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis, the metabolic pathways and molecular functions of the DEGs enriched in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica were clarified, and the response mechanism of salt stress in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica was revealed at the molecular level. A unique salt tolerance mechanism may provide a reference for further mining of salt tolerance genes of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica. Subsequent transgenic, proteomics, and metabolomics studies should be carried out to explain the unique salt tolerance mechanism of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica at multiple levels."

            "text": "In this study, the stems, roots, and leaves of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica seedlings treated with different concentrations of NaCl solution were subjected to transcriptome sequencing. A total of 1,109,438,718 clean reads, accounting for 97.08% of the raw reads, were obtained. The raw reads of each group contained over 94% high-quality reads, producing 166.41 G of high-quality reads. The obtained data were screened under the conditions of |log2 (fold change)| \u2265 1 and padj \u2264 0.05 to obtain DEGs, which illustrated the differences among salt treatments (200 and 400 mmol/L NaCl) and controls. A total of 41,617 DEGs were obtained in each comparison group. Using |log2 (fold change)| \u2265 5 as a selection criteria, a total of 45 DEGs in AP2/ERF, NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC), WRKY, and bZIP transcription factor families in roots, stems, and leaves of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica were screened in this study. P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica have up- and downregulated genes. Generally, the number of upregulated genes in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica was greater than the number of downregulated genes. Thus, it may be inferred that the effects of salt stress on gene expression trends is mainly upregulated. GO functional enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis further clarified the metabolic pathways and molecular functions of the DEGs enriched in P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica. This finding can contribute to the screening salt-stress-responsive candidate genes of P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica from the more enriched metabolic pathways in the future. Through further analyses, a theoretical\nGenes 2022, 13, 1032 24 of 28\nbasis for the cultivation and planting of stress-resistant P. talassica \u00d7 P. euphratica varieties will be established.\nAuthor Contributions: Z.J.H. conceived and directed the project; Y.L. performed all the experiments and the statistical analyses, and wrote the paper; M.X.S. and M.Z. participated in part of the experiments.
