    "abstractText": "The current study aims to synthesize the gelatin-coated nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) to encapsulate sage extract and use this nanoparticle to increase the quality parameters of beef burger samples. NLCs were prepared by formulation of gelatin (as surfactant and coating biopolymer), tallow oil (as solid lipid), rosemary essential oil (as liquid lipid), sage extract (as active material or encapsulant), polyglycerol ester and Tween 80 (as low-molecular emulsifier) through the highshear homogenization\u2013sonication method. The effects of gelatin concentrations and the solid/liquid ratio on the particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of sage extract-loaded NLCs were quantitatively investigated and optimized using a combined D-optimal design. Design expert software suggested the optimum formulation with a gelatin concentration of 0.1 g/g suspension and solid/liquid lipid ratio of 60/40 with a particle size of 100.4 nm, PDI of 0.36, and EE% 80%. The morphology, interactions, thermal properties, and crystallinity of obtained NLC formulations were investigated by TEM, FTIR, DSC, and XRD techniques. The optimum sage extract-loaded/gelatin-coated NLC showed significantly higher antioxidant activity than free extract after 30 days of storage. It also indicated a higher inhibitory effect against E. coli and P. aeruginosa than free form in MIC and MBC tests. The optimum sage extract-loaded/gelatin-coated NLC, more than free extract, increased the oxidation stability of the treated beef burger samples during 90 days of storage at 4 and \u221218 \u25e6C (verified by thiobarbituric acid and peroxide values tests). Incorporation of the optimum NLC to beef burgers also effectively decreased total counts of mesophilic bacteria, psychotropic bacteria, S. aureus, coliform, E. coli, molds, and yeasts of treated beef burger samples during 0, 3, and 7 days of storage in comparison to the control sample. These results suggested that the obtained sage extract-loaded NLC can be an effective preservative to extend the shelf life of",

Sage (Salvia officinalis L.) is a medicinal plant of the Lamiaceae family, known for its interesting chemical properties for various biological activities such as antioxidant and antibacterial effects. The sage extract (SE) contains phenolic compounds, such as phenolic diterpenoids (carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmanol), phenolic acids (caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid), and flavonoids (luteolin derivatives, apigenin derivatives) [8\u201310]. In contrast, the utilization of bioactive ingredients such as plant extracts in food products, is frequently limited due to low stability during food processing situations, which decreases their bioavailability as well as their functional characteristics [11,12]. Nanoencapsulation is a unique method of trapping bioactive compounds in a protective shell. This technique proves highly effective in stabilizing, transferring, solubilizing, preserving, and improving the activity of active ingredients [13,14]. In recent years, there has been significant attention in the food industry towards nanoencapsulation of bioactive ingredients using lipid-based systems and the production of nanocarriers for various applications [11,15,16]. Lipid-based carriers, mainly due to their low toxicity, low cost, and ease of production, are unique delivery systems that can load hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds, depending on the kind of lipids and microencapsulation method applied [17]. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), are one of these systems that are created of solid and liquid lipids, surfactants, and water, in which a liquid lipid core is surrounded by a matrix of solid lipids. NLCs can increase the stability of physicochemical properties, solubility, bioavailability, and controlled release of functional ingredients including nutraceuticals and natural preservatives in food products [18,19]. Therefore, NLC as a new carrier system can be very effective in both fields of producing enriched/functional foods and increasing the shelf life of foods by reducing their spoilage (food preservation). In recent years, various research has been carried out on the encapsulation of phytochemical compounds, extracts, and essential oils by NLC systems such as Mentha pulegium essential oil [20], saffron bioactive compounds [21], cardamom essential oil [22], lutein [23], Quercetin [24], olive leaf extract [25], cinnamon essential oil [26], camelina oil [27], and rosemary extract [28]. The use of polymer coatings for NLC can increase its effective performance, such as increasing the absorption rate and delivery efficiency, incrementing the chemical and enzymatic stability of the encapsulated material, and improving the colloidal stability [26]. Gelatin is a natural polymer that is obtained from part hydrolyzation of collagen in living organisms. This biopolymer was widely used in the food industry due to having unique features, including nontoxicity, inexpensiveness, availability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability [29]. In addition, several studies reported that gelatin can be easily applied as a thin coating to stabilize nanostructures owing to the presence of amine and carboxylic groups [2,30\u201332]. A combined D-optimal design is a type of experimental design that uses a computer algorithm to select the best set of treatment combinations from a candidate set, based on a specified model and an optimality criterion. The optimality criterion aims at maximizing the determinant of the information matrix, which results in minimizing the variance of the parameter estimates for the model. A combined D-optimal design can be useful when there are constraints on the number of runs or the design space, limited resources, a complex model that involves interactions or nonlinear terms, or when classical designs such as factorials and fractional factorials do not apply or are not feasible. A combined D-optimal design can be used for modeling complex processes and formulations by finding the optimal experimental settings and fitting a flexible and accurate model [33]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted on the encapsulation of plant extract as a natural preservative in the tallow oil-based/coated NLC system. Therefore, the current study aimed to optimize the formulation of the sage extract loaded in gelatin-coated NLC composed of tallow oil\u2013rosemary essential oil with a D-optimal combined design. So, the main objectives were (1) preparation of SE loaded NLC using food-grade commercial lipids;\nFoods 2023, 12, 3737 3 of 25\n(2) coating the obtained NLC using gelatin biopolymer and (3) using the optimum coated formulation for inhibiting pathogenic microbial and lipid oxidation in beef burger."

Thermal Analysis\nThe thermal performance was characterized through the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a DSC thermal analyzer (LINSEIS. DSC model P 10). Four mg of lyophilized optimal GL-NLC with and without SE, pure SE, and pure NLC (without gelatin, and SE) was heated from 0 \u25e6C to 130 \u25e6C for 10 \u25e6C/min.

In summary, 1 g of the sample (oil extracted from the burger) was dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and acetic acid with a ratio of 3/2 v/v under magnetic agitation. Then 0.5 mL of saturated potassium iodide solution was added to this solution, and placed in the dark for 1 min. Then, 0.5 mL of starch reagent (1% w/v) was added and titrated with sodium thiosulfate (0.01 N).

In summary, 10 g of beef burger sample was mixed with 90 mL sterile peptone water (0.1%) in a stomacher (Bagmixer 400P, Interscience, France) for 2 min. After that, different serial dilutions (1:10) of microorganisms were prepared in sterile peptone water (0.1%) and inoculated in the plates that were previously incorporated with culture media.

Baird-Parker agar (BPA) supplemented with egg yolk tellurite was used to count total S. aureus after 48 h incubation at 37 \u25e6C [50]. Samples inoculated with Salmonella were plated on Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar (XLD) overlayed with Tetrathionate broth (TTB) using the thin-layer agar method to allow for the recovery of injured cells [50]. Enumeration of E. coli (EC) was performed with the most probable number (MPN) method as reported in the bacteriological analytical manual (BAM) [51].

Panelists were asked to evaluate odor, flavor, color, and overall acceptability using a 1\u20135 hedonic scale, with 1 corresponding to the least-liked beef burgers and 5 corresponding to the most-liked. A score of 3.5 was considered the limit of acceptance or rejection of the sample in terms of sensory evaluators. All samples were raw and there no need to be served; however, informed consent was obtained from the panelists [53]."

The results showed that the increment of GL concentration from 0.1 to 0.8 g/100 g suspension led to a significant increase in particle size (p < 0.05) at all solid/liquid lipid ratios (Figure 1a). The different NLC samples showed particle sizes ranging from 100 to 287 nm falling within the nano and submicron scale. The increase in the solid/liquid lipid ratio from 60/40 to 90/10 had no significant effect on particle size at all gelatin concentrations. Similarly, to mean particle size results, the PDI values increased from 0.36 to 0.6 with increasing gelatin concentrations from 0.1 to 0.8 g/100 g suspension at all solid/liquid lipid ratios; however, it was more significant at low solid/liquid lipid ratio (60/40) (Figure 1b). PDI is an indicator of the uniformity of particle size distribution in the colloidal systems. It ranges from 0.1 to 1 in real colloidal systems and the high value of it shows wider and more nonuniform particle size distribution. Several parameters can affect the particle size of NLC particles such as type of lipid ingredients, solid/liquid lipid ratio, type and concentration of emulsifier and active encapsulated material, homogenization and sonication variables, and cooling rate of pre-emulsion. The low-molecular weight surfactants at optimum concentrations usually can decrease the size of final NLC nanoparticles by decreasing interfacial tension and increasing the pre-emulsion stability, preventing from recrystallization of lipid crystals from beta prim to beta form and inhibiting the aggregation of lipid nanocrystals. However, in current research, gelatin proteins acting as a high molecular weight surfactant increased particle size, which could be attributed to the formation of a thick protein layer in the interface of pre-emulsion (unlike low-molecular surfactant) or change in surface electric repulsion, which in turn increase droplet diameters. Ref. [54] reported particle size of 71.4 to 366.3 nm and PDI value from 0.14 to 0.36 for the pomegranate seed oil-loaded NLCs, which remained stable during 2 months of storage. They declared the particle size and PDI reduction by increment of emulsifier percentage from 2 to 6.Ref.

Similarly, to mean particle size results, the PDI values increased from 0.36 to 0.6 with increasing gelatin concentrations from 0.1 to 0.8 g/100 g suspension at all solid/liquid lipid ratios; however, it was more significant at low solid/liquid lipid ratio (60/40) (Figure 1b). PDI is an indicator of the uniformity of particle size distribution in the colloidal systems. It ranges from 0.1 to 1 in real colloidal systems and the high value of it shows wider and more nonuniform particle size distribution. Several parameters can affect the particle size of NLC particles such as type of lipid ingredients, solid/liquid lipid ratio, type and concentration of emulsifier and active encapsulated material, homogenization and sonication variables, and cooling rate of pre-emulsion. The low-molecular weight surfactants at optimum concentrations usually can decrease the size of final NLC nanoparticles by decreasing interfacial tension and increasing the pre-emulsion stability, preventing from recrystallization of lipid crystals\nFoods 2023, 12, 3737 10 of 25\nfrom beta prim to beta form and inhibiting the aggregation of lipid nanocrystals. However, in current research, gelatin proteins acting as a high molecular weight surfactant increased particle size, which could be attributed to the formation of a thick protein layer in the interface of pre-emulsion (unlike low-molecular surfactant) or change in surface electric repulsion, which in turn increase droplet diameters. Ref. [54] reported particle size of 71.4 to 366.3 nm and PDI value from 0.14 to 0.36 for the pomegranate seed oil-loaded NLCs, which remained stable during 2 months of storage. They declared the particle size and PDI reduction by increment of emulsifier percentage from 2 to 6. Ref. [55] declared that the preparation of NLCs with long-chain triacylglycerols led to high viscosity during the hot homogenization method and, consequently, increased the mean particle size of the produced particles. On the other hand, the fats composed of shorter-chain fatty acids have lower interfacial tension than those containing longer-chain fatty acids, leading to smaller droplet size in the emulsion. Ref. [56] reported that an increment in homogenization cycles did not significantly affect the particle size of phytosterol-loaded NLC but reduced the PDI. Particle size and PDI parameters also stayed stable after 15 days of storage at 25 \u25e6C. In a similar work, ref. [57] utilized an NLC system to encapsulate Hibiscus sabdariffa extract. The particle size was reported as 470 nm for microwave-assisted extract-loaded NLC and 344 nm for pressurized liquid extract-loaded NLC. In another research work, [20] studied the encapsulation of Mentha pulegium essential oil into NLC and reported particle sizes of 40 to 250 nm and PDI of 0.4 for their NLC samples. The zeta potential value shows the amount of electrostatic repulsion between adjacent, similarly charged droplets and particles in a colloidal system. In the current research, the zeta potential of NLCs changed from negative (~\u221218.4 mv) to positive values (~+8 mv) with increasing the gelatin concentrations from 0.1 to 0.8 at all solid/liquid lipid ratios (Figure 1c). This change may be responsible for the increase in particle size due to increased flocculation phenomena. Increasing solid/liquid lipid ratios had no significant effect on zeta potential at all gelatin concentrations. Tween 80 is a nonionic surfactant, and the negatively charged surface of NLC was probably related to the free hydroxyl groups of phenolic compounds in SE extract and essential oils or free fatty acid (carboxylic acid) and the phosphate group of phospholipids, which naturally present in most edible oils and lipids. The surface electrical charge of particles and droplets is considered a key indicator of their colloidal dispersion stability. Thus, it can be assumed that higher electric charges on the surface can lead to higher repellent forces among particles and droplets, which in turn can prevent aggregation. When the zeta potential is small, attractive forces may exceed this repulsion, implying the system may become unstable and particles join together (aggregation/flocculation/coalescence). The electrostatically stabilized dispersions usually need a zeta potential greater than \u00b130 mV to have good long-term stability over storage time; however for colloidal systems stabilized with a combination of ionic and nonionic emulsifiers, a zeta potential of ~\u00b120 mV is sufficient for particles to repel one another due to the presence of steric hindrance resulting from large molecules and long chain hydrocarbons of nonionic emulsifier. Ref. [54] prepared pomegranate seed oil-loaded NLCs, which were stable during 2 months of storage. They reported zeta potential values from \u221218.3 to \u221227.2 mV, which could contribute to long-term physical stability. They also declared that a higher surfactant concentration reduced the zeta potential of NLC formulations. Ref. [18] developed a turmeric extract-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier. They showed that the optimum formulation had an average particle size of 112.4 nm, PDI of 0.37, and zeta potential of \u221223.3 mV. The encapsulation efficiency of NLC samples (EE%) did not follow a specific pattern and ranged from 45 to 80%. Maximum EE% has been observed at a 0.1% gelatin and 60/40 solid-to-liquid lipid ratio. It depended more on the solid/liquid lipid ratio than gelatin concentration. According to previous studies, EE% is dependent on the solid/liquid lipid ratio, type and concentration of surfactants, the lipophilicity of encapsulant (solubility of the bioactive in the NLC matrix), and preparation method of NLC formulation [58]. Ref. [54] reported EE% of 96\u201399% for the pomegranate seed oil-bearing NLC formulations, with a high\nFoods 2023, 12, 3737 11 of 25\namount of EE% related to the heterogeneous composition of different lipids. Ref. [57] encapsulated Hibiscus sabdariffa extract into NLC. They obtained different EE% of quercetin and anthocyanins for extracts prepared by microwaving and pressurizing methods. To overall optimize the formulation of NLCs, the goals of achieving low particle size, high zeta potential, and low PDI were considered and the obtained results were evaluated with the desirability function, where desirability higher than 0.7 indicates optimal conditions. The highest desirability was related to the sample with a concentration of 40% liquid lipid (REO), 60% solid lipid (tallow oil), and a GL concentration of 0.1 g/100 g with desirability of 0.97. The values of particle size (nm), zeta potential (mV), and PDI for the selected optimal sample were obtained as 100.4 nm, \u221218.4 mV, and 0.36, respectively. To assess the validity of the regression models, the actual data were compared with the values predicted by the models. The percentage error of theoretical value and actual value for particle size, PDI, ZP, and EE was 6.34, 5.55, \u22124.43, and \u22121.53, respectively. The ES% of the optimum SE-loaded GL-coated NLC was measured during 60 days of storage at 4 \u25e6C and 25 \u25e6C (Figure 2). As can be seen, immediately after production, the ES% level was the same in both temperatures, while over time, the level of ES% significantly decreased and this decrease was greater at 25 \u25e6C than at 4 \u25e6C.

Thermal Analysis by DSC The type and amount of solid and liquid lipids, surfactants, and active materials can affect the thermal behavior of NLC. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to evaluate the melting and crystallization behavior of lipid-based materials because various lipid structures have different thermal properties. The evaluation of the crystalline and polymorphism behavior of the lipid carrier and the effect of SE encapsulation on the melting behavior of the produced nanocarrier system was performed with the DSC method. Figure 5 shows the thermogram of the free SE extract, NLC without sage extract, NLC without gelatin coating, and optimal SE-loaded GL-coated NLC. According to Figure 5, free sage extract powder did not show any sharp peaks, which could be attributed to the amorphous nature of the extract powder and the lack of melting phenomena [59]. In the DSC curves of NLC samples, the endometrial melting peak could be observed at a temperature lower than 50 \u00b0C, which indicates the presence of irregular crystalline phases of lipids [63]. Considering the use of a combination of solid and liquid lipids in the structure of NLC, this behavior was expected. The presence of different triglycerides and essential oils in NLC compositions can lead to less order and an incomplete lipid crystalline structure with a low melting point, which in turn potentially helps increase encapsulation efficiency and stability during storage.

Immediately after production (first day), the free extract and optimum NLCs showed antioxidant activity close together. However, after 30 days of storage, the antioxidant activity of the free extract was lower than optimum NLCs. This clearly showed the protective effect of the NLC carrier on the antioxidant activity of SE, indicating a more effective antioxidant agent for increasing foods\u2019 shelf life [65]. Similar findings have also been observed in previous studies that used different formulations for bioactive compound encapsulation to increase their antioxidant activity [66\u201369]. It should be noted that the antioxidant activity of SE was related to the presence of several compounds with high antioxidant activity, such as rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, salvianolic acid, and tannins (salvia tannin) [70]. These compounds have the ability to supply hydrogen to stabilize radicals [71]. In addition, the antioxidant properties of NLC without extract were also investigated. This sample contains rosemary essential oil (REO) as a component of liquid lipid in its structure. Based on previous studies, it has been confirmed that REO has high antioxidant activity [72\u201374]. However, our study showed that the antioxidant activity of the extract is higher than REO. Ref. [75] enriched butter samples with free betasitosterol and beta-sitosterol-encapsulated NLC; the antioxidant activity of both samples was then measured during three months of storage. Results showed that the decrement of antioxidant activity of butter samples containing free beta-sitosterol was more than those containing the NLC carrier, showing the suitable protective effect of NLC on betasitosterol. Ref. [18] confirmed higher DPPH antioxidant activity of turmeric extract\u2013NLC in comparison to free turmeric extract. The antioxidant activity of turmeric acid is related to the presence of curcuminoids and hydroxyl groups in its composition. They reported that antioxidant activity decreased in both samples but the level of decrease was higher in the free turmeric extract than the encapsulated one.\nFoods 2023, 12, 3737 17 of 25 x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 7"

            "text": "3.8.1. Chemical Analysis of Beef Burger\nA beef burger is a perishable meat product that could deteriorate easily even under refrigeration conditions. In the present work, the surface pH of beef burger samples treated with free extract and formulated optimum NLC with and without extract was measured on the first day of production, 7 and 90 days after production at two different temperatures (4, and \u221218 \u25e6C) (Figure 8A). The pH of the samples at all three times and different temperatures was around 5.8 and almost constant. In fact, the effects of different treatments on pH were not significantly different. It should also be mentioned that the positive control sample that contained ascorbic acid and sorbate also showed a pH value similar to the treated samples all three times and at different temperatures. However, in the negative control sample, which was the beef burger sample without any additives, an increase in pH (~6) was observed. In the literature, pH values of 6.3 and 6.5 have been reported as the initiation of meat spoilage [77,78]. Oxidation of lipids is one of the important parameters related to the reduction of food quality [50]. The lipid oxidation was determined by measurement of PV and TBARS on the first day of production, and at 7 and 90 days after production at two different temperatures (4, and \u221218 \u25e6C). The PV of beef burger samples treated with free extract-formulated optimum NLC with and without extract during the mentioned period is illustrated in Figure 8B. No significant difference (p \u2264 0.05) was observed between the PV of samples immediately after production. The highest increment of PV value was achieved in the control sample and free extract, while the minimum increment was in the positive control sample during 90 days of storage. Additionally, the PV value increased in the free extract more than the optimum NLC formulation during 90 days of storage. The PV of the negative-control sample was significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) and its maximum value was obtained on day 90 (2.89 \u00b1 0.08 meq O2/kg sample). The PV of all the treated beef burger samples enhanced with time, but at a slower rate in comparison with the negative-control sample. The present study proved that the formulated NLC-containing extract could effectively reduce the lipid oxidation of beef burger samples. The reason for this phenomenon is related to the protective effect of NLC systems on the bioavailability, controlled release, and antioxidant activity of SE, thus helping to increase the antioxidant potential and decrease the rate of lipid oxidation. The degree of hydrolysis, presence of antioxidants, and oxygen availability are three major factors affecting the auto-oxidation rate of lipids. Therefore, it could be concluded that the decrease in hydrolysis as a result of microbial growth inhibition and the antioxidant activity of natural extract/essential oil are the reasons for decreased PV in the treated sample [79]. These results are in good agreement with previous studies that reported that encapsulating bioactive compounds improve their physicochemical performance [19,80,81]. Hydroperoxides are the primary products of auto-oxidation, which in themselves are odorless. However, their decomposition to secondary products leads to the formation of a broad range of carbonyl compounds (such as Malondialdehyde),\nFoods 2023, 12, 3737 19 of 25\nhydrocarbons, furans, and other products that contributes to the rancid taste of decaying food. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) are formed as a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, and the TBARS value is widely used as an indicator of the degree of lipid oxidation in foods. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of several end products formed through the decomposition of lipid peroxidation products. MDA is a highly reactive three-carbon dialdehyde produced as a byproduct of polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation and reacts with TBARS reagent. The increase in TBARS value during storage is due to the increased oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. The bitterness of meat, loss of color, and unpleasant sensorial characteristics increase as the TBARS values increase [44,78,82\u201384]. The results of TBARS of beef burger samples treated with free extract-formulated optimum NLC with and without extract are given in Figure 8C. The TBARS values of the negative-control sample on the day of production, 7 (4 \u25e6C), and 90 (\u221218 \u25e6C) days after production were 0.044 \u00b1 0.004, 1.86 \u00b1 0.169, and 3.143 \u00b1 0.21 mg of MDA/kg of the sample, respectively. The TBARS of all the treated beef burger samples enhanced with time, but at a slower rate in comparison with the negative-control sample. Although all three agents significantly inhibited lipid oxidation and reduced TBARS, the greatest reduction effect was related to the optimum NLC with extract, so that on day 90, the TBARS of the sample treated with it reached 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 mg of MDA/kg of sample. The greatest increase in TBARS was in the control sample, and the minimum increase in this parameter was in the positive control sample and then in the optimum sample during 90 days of storage. Also, TBARS was higher in free extract than in optimum NLC formulation during 90 days of storage. Ref. [54] evaluated peroxide value, as an indicator of chemical stability, in fresh NLC formulations (ranging from 3.51 to 5.07 meq/kg) and showed a slight increment after 40 days of storage. This low change in peroxide value could be related to the protective effect of NLC on the core lipid phase and prevents it from reacting with oxygen. In another research study, rosemary extract, in free and lipid carrier-encapsulated forms, could delay lipid oxidation in beef burgers and extend its shelf life up to 21 days and the encapsulated form showed a greater antioxidant effect than the free form [85].

Bars in the figure without the same superscripts (a and d) represent significant differences at the 0.05 level according to the Duncan test between pH, PV, TBARS, and sensory score at different forms of NLC (p < 0.05).\n3.8.2. Microbial Analysis of Beef Burger\nThe changes in the total counts of mesophilic bacteria, psychotropic bacteria, S. aureus, coliform, E. coli, molds, and yeasts of treated beef burger samples during 0, 3, and 7 days\u2019 storage are presented in Table 6. The treated beef burger samples with optimum NLC showed a significantly (p < 0.05) lower increase in the aerobic mesophilic bacteria population during storage compared to the control sample (beef burger sample without any additives); thus, on days 0, 3, and 7, the population of aerobic mesophilic bacteria in the control sample was 4.29 \u00b1 0.04, 6.86 \u00b1 0.05, and 8.05 \u00b1 0.04 Log CFU/g, respectively, and in the treated beef burger samples with optimum NLC, it had Log CFU/g of 4.29 \u00b1 0.03, 4.40 \u00b1 0.03, and 4.48 \u00b1 0.03, respectively Aerobic mesophilic bacteria are used as an important microbiological indicator to evaluate the health of the production process, the safety evaluation, and as an indicator of spoilage of raw meat [86]. The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) maximum allowable amount of total mesophilic bacteria in meat at refrigerated temperature is between 106 and 107 CFU/g (equivalent to 7\u20136 Log CFU/g) [87]. On the first day, the population of aerobic mesophilic bacteria was around 4.29 Log CFU/g, which indicates the very good quality of the beef burger sample. During the storage period, the total number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria in the treated and control groups increased steadily, but this increase was lower in the treated samples. The antibacterial activity of SE was related to the attendance of several phenolic compounds such as rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, salvianolic acid, and tannins (salvia tannin), which can have positive effects on inhibiting the growth of bacteria [70,88]. Moreover, since the highest antibacterial activity observed was related to the treated sample with the optimum NLC, it confirms the protective effect of NLC systems on SE bioactivity. The population of other tested bacteria, similar to mesophilic bacteria, showed an increasing trend during storage, and this increase was significantly less in the treated samples with optimum NLC than in other samples. Ref. [21] reported the highest antibacterial effect of Mentha pulegium essential oil-loaded NLC was against gram-positive bacteria of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes and also negative bacteria of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ref. [76] declared higher antimicrobial activity for citral-loaded NLC in comparison to the free form of citral.\nFoods 2023, 12, 3737 21 of 25\nPositive-control sample (CP), and Negative-control sample (CN). Superscripts (a\u2013e) show significant differences between groups (p < 0.05). Data are expressed as mean \u00b1SD (n = 3).\n3.8.3. Sensory Evaluation of Beef Burger\nImportant sensory changes in the color, smell, taste, and texture of meats occur during storage, which are caused by bacterial growth and chemical changes such as oxidation, proteolysis, and production of volatile compounds. These unpleasant changes reduce the shelf life and acceptability of meat products. The effect of the free extract, formulated optimum NLC with and without extract on the sensory properties of beef burger samples on the first day of production, the 7th and 90th days of storage is shown in Figure 8D. No significant difference (p \u2264 0.05) was observed between the sensory attribute scores of beef burger samples immediately after production. However, over time, the highest acceptability and acceptance were reported for samples treated with optimized nanostructure and positive control. These better sensory properties in the treated beef burger samples could be attributed to lower proteolytic and lipolytic reactions and lower microbial activities. The greatest decrease in the sensory score was in the control sample during 90 days of storage. Generally, when the population of microorganisms exceeds 7 log CFU/g, off odors can be smelled, attributable to the protein breakdown and accumulation of nonprotein compounds [31]. Ref. [25] reported no significant difference between the sensory properties of the control sample and the fortified sauce sample enriched by the Spanish olive leaf extract-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers. Ref. [39] fortified milk with the hesperetinloaded NLC. Their results showed a successful bitter-taste masking capacity of NLC. Also, encapsulation did not affect the color properties of milk."
