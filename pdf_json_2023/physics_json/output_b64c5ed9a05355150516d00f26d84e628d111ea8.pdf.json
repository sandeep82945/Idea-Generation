    "abstractText": "To enhance targeting efficacy in the radioimmunotherapy of disseminated cancer, several pretargeting strategies have been developed. In pretargeted radioimmunotherapy, the tumor is pretargeted with a modified monoclonal antibody that has an affinity for both tumor antigens and radiolabeled carriers. In this work, we aimed to synthesize and evaluate poly-L-lysine-based effector molecules for pretargeting applications based on the tetrazine and trans-cyclooctene reaction using 211At for targeted alpha therapy and 125I as a surrogate for the imaging radionuclides 123, 124I. Poly-L-lysine in two sizes was functionalized with a prosthetic group, for the attachment of both radiohalogens, and tetrazine, to allow binding to the trans-cyclooctene-modified pretargeting agent, maintaining the structural integrity of the polymer. Radiolabeling resulted in a radiochemical yield of over 80% for astatinated poly-L-lysines and a range of 66\u201391% for iodinated poly-L-lysines. High specific astatine activity was achieved without affecting the stability of the radiopharmaceutical or the binding between tetrazine and transcyclooctene. Two sizes of poly-L-lysine were evaluated, which displayed similar blood clearance profiles in a pilot in vivo study. This work is a first step toward creating a pretargeting system optimized for targeted alpha therapy with 211At.",

            "text": "Targeted therapy involves an agent that selectively exerts a toxic effect on cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment to control cancer while minimizing harmful effects on healthy tissues. Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is a type of cancer therapy in which radiation released from an alpha-emitting radionuclide is used as a means by which to produce cytotoxic effects on tumor cells [1]. The range of \u03b1-particles in tissues is about 25\u2013100 \u00b5m, equivalent to just a few cell diameters, which is ideal for minimizing the irradiation of tumor-adjacent normal tissues [2], and their high energy of about 4\u20138.5 MeV makes them highly efficient at eradicating small clusters or isolated tumor cells [3]. TAT is typically delivered by attaching an alpha-emitting radionuclide to a biological molecule with targeting capability, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptides, or antibody fragments. This vector selectively carries the alpha emitter directly to the target, resulting in a high radiation dose to the tumor cells with generally limited toxicity to the surrounding normal tissues [1,4]. The most common approach in targeted radionuclide therapy has been the use of mAbs. However, the excellent specificity of mAbs for their antigens is compromised by the exposure of healthy tissues to radiation during the long distribution time (24\u201348 h) required for the radioimmunoconjugate to circulate through the body and accumulate at tumor sites [5]. Therefore, when using mAbs as a targeting agent for cancer, the size of the antibody, i.e., its high molecular weight (about 150 kDa), generally results in\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 595. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16040595 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 595 2 of 18\nslow tumor uptake, leading to a low tumor-to-normal tissue ratio [6]. Such a therapeutic strategy could be improved by combining short-lived alpha particle emitters with a smaller carrier molecule [7]. Pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) is an interesting option that takes advantage of the specificity of mAbs to target the antigens expressed on tumors and at the same time it benefits from the fast binding and clearance of radiolabeled small molecules to allow for a high dose to the tumor while reducing the dose to normal tissue associated with directly radiolabeled mAbs [8]. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile of PRIT allows the use of radionuclides with shorter half-lives in systemic settings that otherwise are not compatible with the long circulation time of full-size antibodies. In pretargeting, the treatment is given in two steps: (1) tumor targeting using mAbs, the pretargeting agent, and (2) dose delivery using a small vector, the effector molecule. Separating the slow targeting phase from the delivery of the radionuclide facilitates the optimization of the pharmacokinetics of radiation throughout the body. Today, several pretargeting strategies can be used to combine antibodies and radioligands in vivo; some of them utilize a noncovalent interaction such as streptavidin\u2013 biotin [9\u201311], and some utilize the hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides [12,13] or the ability of bispecific antibodies [14,15] to bind an antigen and a radiolabeled hapten. Last but not least, there is the biorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels\u2013Alder (IEDDA) click reaction, which utilizes the fast and highly specific reaction that occurs between a diene, such as 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (Tz), and a dienophile, particularly trans-cyclooctene (TCO), which appears to be seven times more reactive than the cis-cyclooctene (CCO) in the IEDDA reaction [15\u201319]. The feature of biorthogonal chemistry is typically a click reaction that is feasible under mild conditions; it also has several advantages including that it is modular, wide in scope, stereospecific, and leads to inoffensive bioproducts. For clinical use, the products must be stable under physiological conditions and should ensure the biocompatibility of the reaction to avoid toxicity in living systems [20,21]. In this respect, the Tz\u2013TCO pair is a good option, since neither of these is reactive to potential nucleophiles present in the biological system and their ligation leads only to the release of N2 (gas) as the only side product [22]. Therefore, the combination of selectivity, orthogonality, and rapidity of the IEDDA reaction makes it ideal for use in pretargeting applications. In PRIT, the antibody-based pretargeting agent is preferably functionalized by conjugation with TCO (TCO-mAb), while the effector molecule bearing the radioactive payload is functionalized with tetrazine (Tz-effector). Among the existing alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides, astatine-211 (221At), the second-heaviest halogen [23,24], offers many potential advantages for TAT. 211At decays with a half-life of 7.2 h in two ways, either through \u03b1-emission to 207Bi or electron capture (EC) to 211Po, which promptly decays through \u03b1-emission to stable 207Pb. The average range of the emitted \u03b1-particles in soft tissue is 57 \u00b5m and the average linear energy transfer (LET) is 97 keV/\u00b5m. Two important characteristics of 211At that differ from most other \u03b1-emitters relevant to TAT are that it yields one \u03b1-particle per decay [25,26], and also emits X-rays with energy between 77 and 92 keV during EC decay to 211Po. The polonium X-rays can be monitored by \u03b3-cameras used in clinical diagnostic applications [3,27,28]. Iodine can, in many cases, be used as an analog to astatine for chemical optimization, and moreover, the iodine nuclides 123I and 124I are also relevant for diagnostic imaging applications [29\u201331]. Therefore, astatine and iodine could be used as a theranostic pair for combined therapy and imaging [32]. 125I is significantly more available than 123I or 124I and also displays decay characteristics such as low-energy gamma emission and a long half-life, which make it suitable for use in optimization [33]. Poly-L-lysine (PL) is a water-soluble polymer of the amino acid lysine that is commercially available in a large range of molecular weights. The key features of a radiolabeled effector molecule should be rapid and high accumulation at pretargeted tumor sites and fast clearance from the blood and normal tissues. An important factor affecting the pharmacokinetics of a molecule is its size [34]. Hence, the use of a polymeric scaffold will enable\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 595 3 of 18\nincreased control in in vivo distribution, as polymers of different molecular weights can be employed. Moreover, PL allows for multiple functionalizations of its amino groups, e.g., different degrees of Tz groups can be attached to the backbone, and in this way, the avidity between the effector molecule (Tz-PL) and the pretargeting agent (TCO-mAb) can be improved. This potentially results in more effective pharmacokinetics with improved tumor targeting and increased absorbed dose to tumors [35]. The purpose of this study was to synthesize and evaluate a novel group of effector molecules for pretargeting applications with 211At and 125I, based on a PL scaffold, utilizing the Tz\u2013TCO click reaction according to Figure 1.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 20\nradiolabeled effector molecule should be rapid and high accumulation at pretargeted tu-\nmor sites and fast clearance from the blood and normal tissues.

Trinitrobenzene Sulfonic Acid (TNBSA) analysis of free amine groups was also conducted; however, the experiments did not lead to reliable results. As PL is a homopolymer; when one of its amino groups has been trinitrophenylated, the neighboring lysyl residues become inaccessible, hence only a few of the amino groups can react with TNBSA because of the steric hindrance of the fixed trinitrophenyl group [36]. Electrospray mass spectrometry was also attempted to determine the functionalization ratios, but ionization of the highly charged polymer was found not to be possible. The structural integrity of the polymer after the functionalization steps was verified using Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) analysis (Figure 2). The retention times and curve shapes show that the functionalization of polymers with m-Me-ATE and Tz did not induce any fractionation or agglomeration of the two polymer sizes."

For astatine labeling of functionalized PL of both molecular weights, NIS was found to be the most efficient; for iodine labeling, CAT performed best. It was also observed that, contrary to NCS and CAT, using lower amounts of NIS increased the radiochemical yield (RCY). In addition to the different oxidizing agents that could be applied for radiohalogenation of the effector molecule, the effects of the concentration and amount of polymer were evaluated. It was found that the concentration of the polymer, no matter the molecular weight, did not impact the RCY if it was kept between 0.1 and 1 mg/mL. Similarly, the RCY could be maintained if the absolute amount of the functionalized polymer was kept above 0.05 mg. Applying lower amounts than this led to low yields and/or inconsistent results. The best conditions for efficient and reproducible astatine labeling of conjugated PL of both polymer sizes were obtained by using NIS as an oxidizing agent (10 \u00b5L 20 \u00b5M for 5\u201325 MBq of 211At), which resulted in an RCY of 84.78% \u00b1 0.03 for the small polymer and 85.38% \u00b1 0.02 for the large polymer (based on >20 radiolabeling instances). For the iodination of both sizes of PL, the best conditions were obtained using CAT as an oxidizing agent (25 \u00b5L 8.79 mM for 1 MBq of 125I), in which the corresponding RCY values were 66.68% \u00b1 0.14 for the small polymer and 91.16% \u00b1 0.06 for the large polymer. The radiochemical purity (RCP) of both polymers was 97.7% \u00b1 1.9 for the astatinated products and above 98% for the iodinated products."

The best results achieved so far with both methods are presented in Table 2. Lowering the amount of the effector molecule below 0.05 mg was found to be unsuccessful, as expected based on the results presented above. Increasing the starting activity resulted in a slightly reduced RCY especially for the small polymer, compared to the low-activity labeling. The SA can be expected to be further increased by starting with even higher initial activity. This was particularly evident for the large polymer, as high SA was achieved with a low polymer amount by applying only 57.6 MBq of astatine. In line with what is shown in Table 2, when trying to reach high SA the RCY varies depending on the starting activity and the amount and size of the effector molecule used in the labeling contrary to what happens in low SA labeling where the RCY is very consistent.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 595 6 of 18\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 20 Table 1.

Trinitrobenzene Sulfonic Acid (TNBSA) analysis of free amine groups was also conducted; however, the experiments did not lead to reliable results. As PL is a homopolymer; when one of its amino groups has been trinitrophenylated, the neighboring lysyl residues become inaccessible, hence only a few of the amino groups can react with\nTNBSA because of the steric hindrance of the fixed trinitrophenyl group [36]. Electrospray\nmass spectrometry was also attempted to determine the functionalization ratios, but ion-\nization of the highly charged polymer was found not to be possible. The structural integ-\nrity of the polymer after the functionalization steps was verified using Fast Protein Liquid\nChromatography (FPLC) analysis (Figure 2).

Effector Binding to Pretargeting Agent\nAs the effector binding to beads showed promising results, a pretargeting agent was synthesized by reacting TCO-NHS with lysine groups on the mAb trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae). The binding between the pretargeting agent and the effector molecule was evaluated in vitro using two methods: precipitation and FPLC. In the precipitation method, only the antibody precipitates while the unreacted polymer remains in solution (Figure 5). By radiolabeling the effector, the amount of the effector that has reacted with the pretargeting agent can be evaluated by precipitating the click product. Using the large PL (21 kDa), the results show that for the H-TzPL, the reaction was already complete within the first 5 min (all effector activity in precipitate), while the Me-TzPL reacted completely in 15 min (97% of effector activity in precipitate). When using the small PL (10 kDa), the reaction kinetics was found to be slower with 92% of effector activity in the precipitate for the HTzPL and 52% for the MeTzPL after 5 min. The reaction was completed in 15 min for HTz-substituted PL and in 60 min for the MeTz. A slower reaction kinetics might be due to the lower Tz-functionalization of the small PL. FPLC analysis of the click products was performed to confirm the reaction between the labeled TzPL effector and the TCO-mAb pretargeting agent. FPLC fractions were collected, and the activity was measured on a \u03b3-counter.

The\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 595 11 of 18\nreason for the precipitation of the low-molecular-weight PL was likely overloading of the polymer with reagents, resulting in higher hydrophobicity compared to the high-molecularweight PL. In both cases, a sufficient number of lysine groups were functionalized. Radiolabeling of all four types of effector molecules was shown to be successful. In both astatination and iodination of the polymers, high radiochemical yields with high radiochemical purity were achieved. Astatination yields (85.03% \u00b1 0.03) were higher compared to the RCY generally achieved in the astatination of antibodies utilizing the same prosthetic group and oxidizing agent [33,34]. When a low amount of effector was used, it was observed that the RCY varied according to both the type and amount of oxidizing agent employed in the labeling. The amount of NIS had to be at least 20 times lower than NCS or CAT to reach a high RCY. This is likely due to a competing destannylation reaction between tri-iodine ions liberated from NIS and the radionuclides, leading to a lower RCY. The same competing reaction will not occur when using a chlorinated oxidizing agent, e.g., NCS or CAT [37]. The effect of the degree of functionalization of the polymers was also evident in the RCY. Upon iodination, it was significantly higher for the larger, more substituted polymer compared to the small one. After labeling, the SA of the effectors was assessed. Decreasing the effector amount below a certain level was found to be unsuccessful, most likely due to reaction conditions, including radiolysis, occurring in the highly diluted solutions [38,39]. However, high SA could be obtained by reducing the effector amount to 0.05 mg and increasing the starting activity. This suggests that the SA of the effectors could be further enhanced compared to the data presented here by increasing the starting activity applied during radiolabeling while maintaining a low effector concentration. It was found to be easier to achieve higher SA for 211At using the large effector molecule and applying lower activity, compared to the small effector. This was expected due to the larger presence of prosthetic groups for radiolabeling. Putting the concept of SA into a clinical context, we could apply a starting activity of around 1 GBq, which, assuming the RCY is maintained for the labeling reactions as presented in Table 2, would render an SA value in the region of 1:100 (astatine:polymer). With that said, the SA of both polymer sizes in this work is already clinically relevant when compared to, e.g., directly radiolabeled antibodies [2]. So far, only two clinical studies have been conducted with 211At. In both studies, an activity of around 300 MBq was used as the final dose escalation [40,41]. With the SA levels presented in this paper, this would render a polymer mass of 0.1\u20130.3 mg, which could be considered safe for patient administration. The synthesized effector molecules showed good stability for up to 24 h, which should be more than enough, given the fast blood clearance, with most activity having left the blood system after 5 h. The circulation time of the effector molecules is also well in line with the 7.2 h half-life of astatine. The binding properties of the effector molecule against a TCO-modified pretargeting agent showed rapid binding at physiological pH; after only 5 min, over 90% of both effectors had already reacted when using the large PL while the small PL showed slightly slower reaction kinetics. The good binding properties of the pretargeting agent in combination with the blood profile indicate great promise for efficient in vivo application. In this study, it was shown that by utilizing the Tz-TCO click chemistry system, several different PL effector molecules for pretargeting can be synthesized and successfully functionalized for efficient radiolabeling and binding without compromising the structural identity of the polymer. It was shown that it is possible to stably label the effector with 125I, as a surrogate for imaging nuclides 123I and 124I, and the rare therapeutic alpha-particle emitter 211At with high RCY, RCP, and SA, while still maintaining good binding to TCOfunctionalized mAbs. In future studies, these promising new effector molecules will be further assessed in in vivo models with respect to, e.g., biodistribution and tumor targeting with TCO-modified mAbs.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 595 12 of 18"

The calibration curves were constructed by measuring in triplicate 10 \u00b5L of different concentrations of m-Me-ATE in DMSO/water at 250 nm and Tz in PBS at 270 nm. Then, the absorbance of the functionalized polymer at the two wavelengths was measured and subtracted from the absorbance of the naked reference PL.

TCO-agarose beads were obtained from Click Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale AZ, (USA) in a concentration of 10\u201320 \u00b5mol TCO groups per mL of resin. Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filter, 0.45 \u00b5m from Corning Incorporated, Salt Lake City UT (USA), was used to assess the binding percentage, separating the unbound fraction of TzPL from the one bound to the TCO beads. After assembling the centrifuge tubes, the filter was treated with 500 \u00b5L bovine serum albumin (BSA)-azide in PBS and then centrifuged to minimize unspecific binding. TCO-agarose beads (20 \u00b5L, 15 mM) were added to the filter and centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5702, Hamburg (Germany)for 5 min at 4400 rpm. The beads were then washed with carbonate at pH 8.5 and centrifuged again. Then, labeled TzPL eluted in carbonate at pH 8.5 (217 \u00b5L, 1.4 mM) was added to the tube. Unless otherwise stated, the labeled TzPL was allowed to react with TCO beads for 1 h. At the end of the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 4400 rpm, washed with carbonate at pH 8.5, and centrifuged again. The reservoir (filter) was separated from the centrifuge tube containing the unbound filtered fraction and the\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 595 16 of 18\nwashing buffer and measured separately on the \u03b3-counter.
