    "abstractText": "The present study examines a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer produces a product with a national brand (NB) and the retailer selling both the NB product and his own premium store brand (PSB) product. The manufacturer competes with the retailer through improving the quality by using innovation over time. It is assumed that both advertising and enhanced quality play positive roles in customers\u2019 loyalty over time for the NB product. We propose four scenarios, including: (1) Decentralized (D), (2) Centralized (C), (3) Coordination with a revenue-sharing contract (RSH), and (4) Coordination with a two-part tariff contract (TPT). A Stackelberg differential game model is developed, and parametric analyses and managerial insights are provided based on a numerical example. Our results show that: (1) Introducing a PSB product alongside selling the NB product is profitable for the retailer, (2) In Scenario D and RSH, the manufacturer tries to increase the quality gap with the PSB product through innovation, (3) Customers\u2019 loyalty leads to higher prices, levels of innovation, quality, and advertising for the NB product, (4) The TPT contract can lead to perfect coordination and yield higher profits for the manufacturer and the retailer.",

            "text": "Supply chain (SC), as a connected network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers, is one of the critical issues in today\u2019s researches. There are various topics\nB Morteza Rasti-Barzoki rasti@cc.iut.ac.ir\nParisa Assarzadegan assarzadegan@iut.ac.ir\nSeyed Reza Hejazi rehejazi@cc.iut.ac.ir\n1 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan 84156-83111, Iran\nin Supply Chain Management (SCM) that can be addressed, such as product development, demand management, marketing and sales, logistic, production, Research and Development (R&D), and customer relationship management (Lambert & Enz, 2017). Introduction of Store Brand products (SBs) or Private Label products (PLs) plays a significant role in the profitability and decisions of SC\u2019s members. The competition between National Brand products (NBs) and SB products in the SC and interactions of manufacturers and retailers have attracted the researchers\u2019 attention (Assarzadegan & Hejazi, 2021; Cheng et al., 2021, 2022; Milberg et al., 2019; Niu et al., 2021; Tsafarakis et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2021).\nPrivate Label Manufacturers Association (PLMA, 2021) has reported that retailers tend to put SBs in a better position than NBs by offering high-quality products. Most countries have a market share of 30% or more for store brands, and the highest market shares can be found in Spain, Switzerland, and the UK (about 50% in each of these countries). With the growth of SBs, several large retailers such as Tesco, Walmart, Carrefour, and Safeway have introduced SBs in various categories. In today\u2019s world, SBs exist in both food categories, including beverages, dry grocery, fresh and refrigerated foods, and non-food categories, including health and beauty, cosmetic, household, and auto aftercare_ENREF_127. Several articles in recent years have discussed the growth of SBs and their impact on the supply chain and retailing. \u201cAnnals of Operations Research\u201d as one of the leading journals in this field, has published several articles on various topics such as competition between manufacturers and retailers in the supply chain with the presence of SBs and the effect of various contracts such as revenue-sharing, profit sharing, and two-part tariff contracts on the coordination between manufacturers and retailers (Amrouche et al., 2008).\nThere are three types of SBs, including Generic Store Brand products (GSBs), CopyCat Store Brand products, and Premium Store Brand products (PSBs). Gielens et al. (2021) introduced a new strategy for store brands called \u201cSmart Store Brand\u201d products (SSBs). They claimed that in the current marketplace, retailers should pay attention not only to price and quality, but also to issues such as sustainability, social responsibility, and ethics. Premium Store Brand products introduced into the market with unique packaging as a source of distinction follow such added value strategies as providing valuable products, increasing sales, improving margin gains, effecting prices close to or above those of NBs, and offering qualities equal or superior to those of NBs (Kumar, 2007). PSB examples are \u201cPresident\u2019s Choice\u201d (for Loblaws), \u201cFior Fiore\u201d (for Fior Fiore), \u201cSam\u2019s Choice\u201d (for Walmart), and \u201cTesco Finest\u201d (for Tesco) (Elisa & Donata Tania, 2020).\nAccording to Jacoby and Kyner (1973), brand loyalty is (1) non-random, (2) behavioral response (i.e., buying), (3) expressed over time, (4) described by some decision-making units according to one or more alternative brands, (5) is a function of psychological processes (decision-making and evaluation). Keller (1993) defined brand loyalty as \"a favorable attitude towards a brand that leads to the sustainable purchase over time.\" Therefore, one of the factors in determining brand loyalty is the time factor.\nManufacturers in competition with retailers try to increase their customers loyalty over time through innovation, advertising, and high-quality products. They use innovation as a means of differentiation to improve loyalty and quality gaps with PSBs over time (Kumar, 2007). Brand loyalty leads to benefits such as reducing marketing costs, creating new customers, increasing market share and relative prices, reducing search motivation, and creating more loyal customers to competitive strategies (Chaudhuri & Holbrook, 2001).\nTherefore, one of the most competitive advantages for manufacturers is having loyal customers. What are the ways to get these loyal customers? For example, \u201cKraft Heinz\u201d company is a leading manufacturer in the food industry and is recognized as an innovative brand. The product innovation activities, including innovative packaging, providing healthy\nproducts, and improving the product\u2019s taste. On the other hand, the cost of advertising for Heinz has grown significantly in recent years. The company\u2019s strategy to counter the entry of private labels is to introduce everyday low pricing programs (Gehlhar Mark et al., 2009). Also, Innocent drinks is a UK company that manufactures healthy drinks and smoothies. In 2009, \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d company invested Innocent. The activities in the product innovation, including using natural ingredients, sustainable packaging, and resource efficiency. For promotional purposes, the company uses television advertising, direct email advertising, online advertising, magazine, and outdoor advertising. On the other hand, Coca-Cola\u2019s advertising is beneficial for Innocent drinks (Abbing, 2010).\nRetailers also try to bring PSBs\u2019 features closer to NBs by improving the quality over time. Let\u2019s review a real-world example of the NB and PSB competition: Loblaws (the Canadian retailer) offers about 5000 SB products, and 30% of its sales are related to SBs. It has a premium store brand named \u201cPresident\u2019s Choice\u201d, consisting of grocery products, financial, andmobile services. This premium store brand (\u201cPresident\u2019sChoice\u201d) attractsmany customers and has gained significant loyal customers. The \u201cPresident\u2019s Choice\u201d competes with National Brands and focuses on quality rather than price. For example, in the market of chocolate chip cookies, there are two brands: \u201cChips Ahoy!\u201d (National Brand) and \u201cThe Decadent\u201d under the label of \u201cPresident\u2019s Choice\u201d (Premium Store Brand). \u201cThe Decadent\u201d uses creamery butter and about 20%more chocolate chips than \u201cChipsAhoy!\u201d. These features cause \u201cTheDecadent\u201d to be the leading brand inCanada\u2019s chocolate chip cookies andovertake the \u201cChips Ahoy\u201d.\nDue to the COVID-19 and the economic crisis created in the world, the growth of SBs has increased significantly. Therefore, the competition between NB manufacturers and retailers has increased, and providing solutions to increase the coordination between NB manufacturers and retailers in the supply chain has been considered more than before. Unlike in the past that SBs had lower quality and price compared to NBs, in today\u2019s world SBs compete with NBs in terms of quality. Therefore, NB manufacturers are required to use innovation and advertising to increase their profitability in order to increase the loyalty of their customers. Two issues of coordination between NB manufacturers and retailers and increasing the loyalty of NBs are important issues in SCM. On the other hand, one of the new and interesting topics in this field is the modeling of demand functions for NBs and SBs in SCM, considering important factors such as customer loyalty and designing coordination strategies between NB manufacturers and retailers dynamically.\nDesigning supply chain contracts (i.e., Revenue-Sharing, Two-Part Tariff, Profit-Sharing, etc.) for coordination between manufacturers and retailers is a new topic that has attracted the attention of researchers (Cheng et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2013; Huo, 2021; Li et al., 2018).\nThe present article tries to answer these research questions:\n(1) What decisions does the manufacturer make over time for pricing, levels of advertising, and innovation for the NB product? What is the retailer pricing decision over time for PSB and NB products? (2) How is the competition between the NB manufacturer and the retailer with the introduction of the PSB product and considering the coordination contracts between them over time? (3) What effects does the design of RSH and TPT contracts have on the manufacturer\u2019s decisions (levels of advertising, innovation, and the wholesale price) and the retailer decisions (NB and PSB retail prices)? Can contracts increase the profits of SCmembers?\n(4) What effects do innovation and advertising have on customers\u2019 loyalty to theNB product over time? Is customers\u2019 loyalty profitable for themanufacturer?What about the retailer? Can the increase in customers\u2019 loyalty lead to higher prices? (5) What effects does the introduction of a PSB product have on the decisions of SC members? Do the costs of producing a PSB product affect the competition between the NB and PSB products?\nThe key findings can be summarized as follows. First, the optimal decisions of NB\u2019s and PSB\u2019s pricing, levels of innovation, advertising are obtained over time. Second, we show that both the manufacturer and the retailer increase prices when customers\u2019 loyalty rises over time. Third, the TPT contract can lead to perfect coordination, and the manufacturer\u2019s and the retailer\u2019s profits under the TPT contract are higher than the RSH contract.\nThe rest of this article is as follows. A literature review is provided in Sect. 2. The model and the related assumptions are defined in Sect. 3. Section 4 introduces four scenarios and the solution methods, and Sect. 5 presents analyses, the comparison between scenarios, and managerial implications. Conclusions are presented in Sect. 6."

            "text": "Karray and Zaccour (2005) studied a SC with one manufacturer and a retailer with a SB. The authors modeled the problem as a differential game and studied the effects of introducing the SB product and cooperative advertising decisions.Mart\u00edn-Herr\u00e1n and Taboubi (2005) studied a supply chain including twomanufacturers (as the leaders) supplying two competitive brands and one retailer (the follower). They provided a Stackelberg differential game model and investigated decisions related to shelf space allocation and advertising. They concluded that advertising and shelf space allocation decisions were affected by the level of customers\u2019 goodwill (toward both brands). Mart\u00edn-Herr\u00e1n et al. (2006) explored the decisions of shelf space and pricing for two competing brands. They provided a Stackelberg game model to obtain optimal decisions.\nHe et al. (2007) surveyed the Stackelberg differential game models used in marketing channels and SCM. Amrouche et al. (2008) formulated the problem of competition between aNBproduct and a store one as a differential gamemodel and provided Feedback-Stackelberg advertising and pricing strategies. Karray andMart\u00edn-Herr\u00e1n (2009) used a differential game model for a channel with one manufacturer and a retailer who introduced a SB product to study decisions related to the pricing and advertising (both competitive and complementary). Palmeira and Thomas (2011) maintained that the simultaneous introduction of value and premium SBs would enhance the customer\u2019s appraisal of the PSB\u2019s quality.\nYue et al. (2013) analyzed a SC composed of a manufacturer and one retailer and studied optimal advertising and pricing decisions. They proposed the Profit-Sharing (PSH) contract to integrate SC. Chen (2015) investigated pricing and advertising decisions in a dual-channel SC. They considered two groups of consumers, including (1) manufacturer-loyal consumers (or brand-loyal consumers), (2) retailer-loyal (or store-loyal consumers), and addressed a game model. Li et al. (2016) provided a TPT contract to coordinate a dual-channel green SC and studied optimal pricing and greenness related to the green product. They also considered consumer loyalty to the retailer in their model. Hara and Matsubayashi (2017) proposed a game model based on Hotelling\u2019s linear city model (Hotelling, 1990) to conclude that the production of multiple PSBs would guarantee the success of cooperation between one manufacturer and a retailer.\nChung and Lee (2017) proposed a SC with one (or two) manufacturer(s) and a retailer to investigate the quality positioning of NB and SB products. Mai et al. (2017) suggested three warranty contracts from the retailer to the manufacturer for SB products to motivate the manufacturer to enhance the SBs\u2019 quality. Chung and Lee (2018) conducted an empirical investigation to study the effects of introducing SBs on pricing policies. They discovered that the SB introduction changed the structure of price leadership. Li et al. (2018) suggested a Stackelberg game model examine the effects of Money-Back Guarantee (MBG) offered for NBs and SBs. They proposed a coordination contract to create win\u2013win conditions for both the retailer and the manufacturer.\nHuang and Feng (2020) examined a SC including one manufacturer and a retailer with its own SB product. They considered different MBG policies for both brands and used game models to determine pricing decisions. Zhao et al. (2020) addressed a SC with a common retailer and two manufacturers. They assumed that manufacturers sell substitutable products to the retailer under the RSH contract and decide pricing and shelf space strategies. They provided three game models (Nash, Stackelberg, and collusion) to solve the problem. Bart et al. (2020) reviewed articles that used RSH contracts in SCs and studied the future trend of RSH contracts in operations management.\nLiu et al. (2020) studied a Cost-Sharing contract to coordinate a SC and used a Stackelberg gamemodel to examine optimal pricing decisions and the supplier\u2019s effort performance. Khorshidvand et al. (2021) developed three models, including Centralized SC (CSC), Decentralized SC (DSC), and Modified Centralized SC (MCSC) in a multi-channel SC. They applied a Stackelberg game model to investigate decisions of greenness, pricing, and advertising. Cheng et al. (2021) investigated the SB introduction effect on a three-echelon SC and concluded that the SB introduction is profitable for SC\u2019s members. Pei et al. (2021) proposed two coordination strategies in online-to-offline retailing, including quantity discount to the retailer and a rebate to customers. They addressed a Stackelberg game model to examine pricing decisions in both online and offline channels.\nSong et al. (2021) developed a Stackelberg differential game model and investigated pricing and innovation efforts over time in a decentralized and centralized SC with one buyer and one seller. Huo (2021) reviewed the mechanism of SC coordination in the presence of SBs in five categories, including advertising, channel coordination, rebate and promotion strategies, shelf space allocation, and contracts. He also addressed a Stackelberg differential game model to investigate the information-sharing scenarios of advertising costs related to NBandSBproducts.Al-Monawer et al. (2021) studied a SCwith amanufacturer and a retailer that sells both NB and SB products. They formulated the problem as a game theoretic model to study the effect of the NB\u2019s and SB\u2019s customer bases on the manufacturer\u2019s willingness to collaborate with the retailer for the SB introduction, pricing, and quality decisions of NB and SB products. They concluded that when the SB\u2019s customer base is large, the manufacturer\u2019s willingness to collaborate is more.\nShen et al. (2022) used a game-theoretic model to study the pricing of NB and SB under two contracts including wholesale and agency. They determined the equilibrium decisions of advertising and pricing forNB and SBproducts. Their results showed that the retailer prefer to introduceSBsunder thewholesale contract and the agency contract increases the retailer\u2019s and the manufacturer\u2019s profits. Zhang and Hou (2022) studied a SC with a NB manufacturer and an e-tailer that introduces its own SB. They considered two sales modes including reselling and agency selling and compared their environmental performance. They concluded that the manufacturer (e-tailer) favors reselling (agency selling) for the high percentage fee. Karray and Mart\u00edn-Herr\u00e1n (2022) studied a SC with two NB manufacturers and a retailer that can offers its ownSBs. They considered decision timing for advertising and pricing and developed\na Stackelberg gamemodel. Their findings suggest that if NBmanufacturers determine pricing decisions before advertising, the SB introduction for the retailer is detrimental.\nHuang et al. (2022) addressed a SC including a NB manufacturer and a retailer with its own SB and considered two formats for disclosure of quality information including retailer disclosure and manufacturer disclosure. They showed that the SB introduction causes the manufacturer to disclose quality information conservatively and the retailer only reveal quality information if he introduces the SB and the SB. Li et al. (2022) used a game theoretic approach to analyze a SC with one manufacturer and one retailer that has its own SB. They studied SB encroachment strategies for the retailer and concluded that the PSB introduction improves consumers\u2019 welfare and channel profit. Hsiao et al. (2022) examined a SC with one NB manufacturer and a retailer that offers its own SB. They concluded that when the NB manufacturer supplies the SB product to the retailer, both the manufacturer and the retailer benefit from revealing the supplier information. But, if the SB is manufactured by a third party, both the manufacturer and the retailer adjust a non-disclosure strategy."

            "text": "According to the reviewed articles, two issues are not addressed in the literature review: First, the number of articles that considered contract design in the competition between NB manufacturers and retailers for NB and PSB products is limited. In the researches of Li et al. (2018) and Huang and Feng (2020), the impact of the MBG contract on NB and PSB pricing and coordination ofmanufacturers and retailerswere investigated. The contracts such asRSH, TPT, CSH, etc., can lead to supply chain coordination and increase cooperation between manufacturers and retailers. We proposed four scenarios for the supply chain, including (1) Decentralized, (2) Centralized, (3) Coordinationwith aRSH contract, (4) Coordinationwith a TPT contract to study the impacts of contracts on competition betweenNB and PSB products.\nSecond, among the articles on competition between NB and PSB products, there is no article on modeling customers\u2019 loyalty to the NB product over time, while customers\u2019 loyalty is one of the most important and influential factors in manufacturers\u2019 decisions. Also, in articles such as Karray and Zaccour (2005), Karray and Mart\u00edn-Herr\u00e1n (2009), Amrouche et al. (2008), and Huo (2021), the time factor is taken into account in pricing and advertising decisions of SBs and NBs. But so far, no research has considered the time factor in modeling customers\u2019 loyalty.\nThird, in the previous studies, the coordination contracts between NB manufacturers and retailerswere studied statically. In this study,we formulated the demand functions for bothNB and SB products dynamically and examined the impacts of coordination contracts including RSH and TPT on pricing, loyalty, levels of innovation, and advertising dynamically. Also, a dynamic quality function considering innovation was presented for the first time in this paper and modeled as one of the factors influencing customer loyalty over time.\nIn the present study, for the first time, the customers\u2019 loyalty function to the NB product is modeled over timewith innovation and advertising as its parameters.Moreover, a Stackelberg differential game model is proposed for problem-solving.\nTable 1 shows the related research gap among previous studies. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 The influence of innovation on the NB\u2019s quality is considered over time, and a quality function is formulated based on innovation over time. In the quality function, it is assumed that innovation increases the quality over time. It helps manufacturers to consider innovation, improve the quality, and increase the quality gaps with SB products.\nTable 1 Previous studies and the research gap\nReferences Summary Research gap\nAmrouche et al. (2008) Linear goodwill functions according to advertising for both NB and SB products are used over time. They provided a Feedback-Stackelberg game to examine pricing and advertising decisions These papers considered linear and non-linear goodwill functions according to advertising over time for both NB and SB products. We developed a loyalty function for the NB product according to innovation and advertising over time\nKarray and Mart\u00edn-Herr\u00e1n (2009)\nThey formulated non-linear goodwill functions for NB and SB products over time according to advertising. A differential game model is examined for pricing and advertising decisions\nMai et al. (2017) They provided three extended warranty to encourage the SB\u2019s manufacturer to improve the SB\u2019s quality. The pricing decisions are studied through a Stackelberg game model The mentioned paper addressed only the static pricing decision through contracts. In this paper, for the first time, we obtained innovation, advertising, and pricing decisions over time and examined the effects of two contracts including two-part tariff and revenue-sharing on decisions\nLi et al. (2018) They examined return policies for both NB and SB products and obtained pricing decisions using a Stackelberg game model\nAl-Monawer et al. (2021) They introduced MBG policy for both NB and SB products. The pricing decisions are studied through Stackelberg game model\nThey focused on the impact of return policy on marketing and pricing in a SC with the presence of a SB product\nShen et al. (2022) Wholesale contract and agency contract are used to study the NB manufacture\u2019s strategy for advertising and the retailer\u2019s strategy for SB introduction. They developed a game-theoretic model and analyzed pricing and advertising decisions Their focus is how wholesale contract and agency contract effect on advertising strategy (for the NB manufacturer) and the SB introduction strategy (for the retailer). However, like other papers, they have formulated the decisions statically and considering only the two variables of advertising and price\n\u2022 The customers\u2019 loyalty function to the NB product (NB loyalty function) is modeled based on two factors of innovation and advertising over time. Also, the positive effect of loyalty is considered for the NB demand function over time. This loyalty function helps manufacturers and retailers to consider their customers\u2019 loyalty in pricing decisions. \u2022 Advertising, innovation, and pricing decisions for the NB product and pricing decision for the PSB product are obtained over time. It helps the manufacturers to adjust the price, advertising, and innovation of their brands over time. On the other hand, retailers can also set the price of the PSB product over time. \u2022 Two contracts, including RSH and TPT contracts, are designed between the retailer and the manufacturer to coordinate the SC. It can help both manufacturers and retailers design contracts in their relationship and increase their profits. \u2022 Premium store brand introduction is examined over time considering the coordination strategies between the NB manufacturer and the retailer. The profit functions of the NB manufacturer and the retailer in four scenarios are compared over time, and the best strategy for coordination is investigated.\nTable 2 shows the characteristic of previous articles and the present article."

The wholesale price for the manufacturer\u2019s product is w(t), and the retailer\u2019s prices for the NB product and thePSBproduct are pN B(t) and pP SB(t), respectively. TheNBandPSBproducts are substitutable. The manufacturer to compete with the retailer, tries to increase the loyalty of its customers through innovation (\u03bc(t)) and advertising (A (t)) over time. The retailer will also increase the PSB demand by introducing a high-quality (qP SB ) product to compete with the NB product.\nIt is supposed that the manufacturer\u2019s product initial quality is q0N B , and the manufacturer improves the quality through innovation. Chenavaz (2012) and Pan and Li (2016) studied the product (process) innovation to enhance (reduce) the quality (production cost). The initial level for quality is not considered in these studies. In Eq. (1), \u03c6 measures the impact of innovation on the quality and q0N B is the manufacturer\u2019s product initial quality:\nqiN B (t) \u03c6\u03bci (t) + q0N Bi {D, C, RSH , T PT } (1) Assuming that the enhanced quality and advertising increases the customer loyalty, the\ndynamic NB loyalty function may be formulated as Eq.

Moreover, the market base of NB will be equal to \u03b11 for zero values of NB and PSB prices as well as that of NB loyalty. This form of demand function is similar to those reported in (Soleimani et al., 2016), (Zhang et al., 2018), (Mandal et al., 2021) and (Taleizadeh et al., 2021).\nDiN B(t) \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b21 piN B(t) + b1 piP SB(t) + \u03b31N BLi (t)i {D, C, RSH , T PT } (3) The retailer in competition with the NB product increases the PSB\u2019s quality (e.g., new packaging, high-quality raw materials, etc.). PSB demand (Relation (4)) is negatively influenced by its price but positively influenced by both NB price (due to the substitutability of NB and PSB products) and PSB\u2019s quality. The PSBmarket basewill be equal to \u03b12 for zero values of PSB and NB prices as well as PSB quality.

            "text": "Result 1 According to Figs. 5 and 6, the manufacturer increases advertising and innovation over time in all scenarios. Therefore, the increase in advertising and innovation of the NB product leads to an increase in customers\u2019 loyalty over time (Fig. 7).\nManagerial insight 1 Manufacturers believe that one of the most important ways to deal with the PLs\u2019 growth is to use innovation and advertising constantly. For example, \u201cKraft Heinz\u201d, as a national brand, has a strong focus on innovation and advertising to counter the success of PLs such as \u201cPresident\u2019s Choice\u201d (for Loblaws) and \u201cTesco\u201d (for Tesco). Manufacturers increase levels of innovation and advertising over time. By increasing innovation, quality, and advertising over time, the brand image in customers\u2019 mind improves and leads to the increase in their loyalty to the brand over time.\nGr\u00f6nroos (2000) also concluded that enhancing the quality over time will increase customer retention, sales, and profits. On the other hand, the TPT contract yields higher innovation, advertising, and loyalty over time. One of the advertising strategies for NBs is social media channels. The NB manufacturers can increase the loyalty of their customers through advertising on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. For\nTable 5 Summary of the results\nFig. 7 NB loyalty over time under various scenarios\nexample, \u201cStarbucks\u201d has invested in social networks in recent years to switch from traditional advertising channels and in 2018, won silver IPA Effectiveness award for its social strategy.\nExamining brand loyalty over time by considering the factors of innovation and advertising for national brands, as well as by considering revenue-sharing and two-part tariffs contracts over time, is one of the main contributions of this article.\nResult 2 According to Figs. 8 and 9, the retailer increases the NB\u2019s and PSB\u2019s retail prices over time. Also, when the manufacturer and the retailer determine their decisions separately (Scenario D), the retailer considers a higher price for the NB product. However, when the manufacturer and the retailer determine their decisions integrated (ScenarioC) and participate in TPT contract (Scenario TPT), the PSB\u2019s price is higher than other scenarios.\nManagerial insight 2 As customers\u2019 loyalty to the NB product increases over time, competitive pressure to reduce prices decreases, which in turn causes increase in the NB\u2019s price over time. It is a common and real-world experience that customers are willing to pay more for\ntheir favorite brands. For example, in the packaged coffee category, there are several brands including, \u201cFlogers\u201d, \u201cDouwe Egberts\u201d, and \u201cMaxwell House\u201d. The price competition in these brands is high, but why are customers willing to pay $3 for a cup of \u201cStarbucks\u201d coffee? The answer to this question is that \u201cStarbucks\u201d has loyal customers visiting \u201cStarbucks\u201d Caf\u00e9 20 times a month.\nOne of the most important factors in increasing loyalty in today\u2019s market is \u201ccustomer experience\u201d. It means that customers are willing to pay more if they receiving great experience, even up to a 16% price premium. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance customer experience is a successful solution. For example, \u201cNestl\u00e9\u201d uses a chatbot for delivering special offers, and \u201cPepsiCo\u201d uses self-driving robots to deliver food.\nManagerial insight 3 Increasing loyalty over time allows both the manufacturer and the retailer to eke out their profits. The retailer also uses increasing customers\u2019 loyalty over time as a competitive advantage and increases the PSB\u2019s price. The introduction of a PSB allows the retailer to gain more profits. For example, Tesco (the British retailer) sells 100 g of milk chocolate under the premium store brand \u201cTesco Finest\u201d more expensive than (\u00a31.3) 110 g of milk chocolate under the national brand \u201cCadbury\u201d (\u00a31). Therefore, as in the real-world cases, increasing loyalty leads to increasing prices, the modeling presented in this article also shows that loyalty is an important factor in increasing prices.\nResult 3 According to Fig. 10, as cN B (the production cost of NB product) rises, the manufacturer decreases the levels of innovation in all scenarios over time, but as cP SB (the production cost of PSB product) rises, the manufacturer increases the level of innovation over time (Fig. 11).\nManagerial insight 4Themanufacturer reacts to increasing the production cost ofNBproduct by reducing innovation, and thereby decreasing its quality over time. In contrast, in reaction to the increased production cost of the PSB product, themanufacturer enhances the quality by\nFig. 12 Effect of \u03b31 on the NB\u2019s price over time under various scenarios\nFig. 13 Effect of \u03b32 on the PSB\u2019s price over time under various scenarios\nincreasing innovation over time. It means that the manufacturer is trying to raise the quality gap with the PSB product over time.\nResult 4 According to Fig. 12, as \u03b31 increases, the retailer increases the price of NB product over time and the price increase in scenarios C and TPT is higher than others. Figure 13 shows that with the increase of \u03b32 over time, the price of the PSB product also increases, and this increase is more in C and TPT scenarios than in other scenarios.\nManagerial insight 5 By increasing the effect of NB loyalty on its demand and on the other hand, increasing the effect of PSB\u2019 quality on its demand, the retailer can charge a higher price for both brands. This shows the importance of customer loyalty for NBs and the product quality for SBs in pricing. In other words, retailers charge higher prices over time for highquality SBs and NBs with high customer loyalty.\nResult 5 As you can see in Figs. 14, 15 and 16, as \u03b21 increases over time, the NBmanufacturer decreases the levels of innovation, advertising, and price for NB product, respectively. This shows that the sensitivity of customers to the price can force the NB manufacturer to reduce\nFig. 15 Effect of \u03b21 on the levels of advertising over time under various scenarios\nFig. 16 Effect of \u03b21 on the NB\u2019s price over time under various scenarios\nthe level of innovation and advertising for the NB product, and as a result, the price of the product will decrease.\nManagerial insight 6 As the price sensitivity of the demand for the NB product increases, the NB manufacturer is forced to reduce the cost of the product, and since the costs related to innovation and advertising are influential in product pricing, with the increase of the customers\u2019 sensitivity to the price, the NB manufacturer reduces the level of innovation and advertising so that by reducing the costs related to innovation and advertising, the NB product\u2019s total cost will reduce, and consequently the final price of the NB product will also decrease.\nResult 6 As you can see in Figs. 17 and 18, the retailer increases the NB\u2019s and PSB\u2019s retail prices over time by rising the PSB\u2019s production cost. This shows that one of the influential parameters in the pricing of national and store brands is the PSB production cost. On the other hand, the NB\u2019s retail price under the decentralized scenario and the PSB\u2019 retail price under the two-part tariff contract are higher than other scenarios.\nManagerial insight 7 One of the factors influencing the retailer\u2019s pricing decision is the PSB\u2019s production cost over time. As the PSB\u2019s cost is increased over time, the retailer raises the PSB\u2019s and NB\u2019s selling prices. The retailer will try to compensate for the increased production cost of its own brand through the greater earnings made from increased prices\nFig. 18 Effect of cP SB on the PSB\u2019s price over time under various scenarios\nof NB and PSB products. Therefore, managing the PSB\u2019s production costs over time is an important issue that plays a crucial role in supply chain pricing decisions. There are various ways of producing premium store brand products, such as outsourcing, produce by retailers, cooperationwithmanufacturers, etc. Choosing the appropriate productionmethod to produce PSB products at affordable production costs can affect supply chain performance.\nThere are dedicated SBs manufacturers (\u201cCott Corporation\u201d, \u201cMcBride\u201d, \u201cAegle Nutrition\u201d, etc.) that manufacturer SBs at high volumes and low margins. For example, \u201cAegle Nutrition\u201d offers low cost, high quality, short lead-time, and full service SB manufacturing. \u201cWalmart\u201d, \u201cCVSpharmacy\u201d, \u201cWalgreens\u201d, \u201cWhole Foods\u201d and \u201cUnfi\u201d are among its clients.\nResult 7 According to Proposition 9, the lower and upper bound for the manufacturer\u2019s and the retailer\u2019s profit under TPT contract are shown in Figs. 19 and 20, respectively. As it is clear in the figures, both the NB manufacturer\u2019s profit and the retailer\u2019s profit are higher in the centralized scenario than other scenarios. Also, scenario D for the NB manufacturer and scenario RSH for the retailer bring the lowest profitability.\nManagerial insight 8 The centralized SC is more profitable for both the retailer and the manufacturer. As mentioned, under this scenario, the PSB\u2019s price, the NB\u2019s advertising,\ninnovation, and the profits of themanufacturer and the retailer are higher than other scenarios. If Scenario C is not practical, the TPT contract can lead to perfect coordination and yield higher profits for the retailer and the manufacturer than the RSH contract."

            "heading": "6 Conclusion",
            "text": "A supply chain was presented in this paper that involved a manufacturer and one retailer who offered a PSB alongside the NB product. The manufacturer enhanced customer loyalty over time not only through advertising but also by using innovation. The retailer also competed with themanufacturer by introducing its own high-quality product. Studying the NB and PSB competition by considering customers\u2019 loyalty over time in the supply chain is a novel aspect of the paper. We developed four scenarios for the supply chain, including (1) Decentralized, (2) Centralized, (3) Coordination with the RSH contract, and (4) Coordination with the TPT contract. Our results indicated that under the two-part tariff contract, the levels of innovation, advertising, and NB\u2019s and PSB\u2019s price are more than the revenue-sharing. On the other hand, the NB manufacturer\u2019s and the retailer\u2019s profits under the two-part tariff contract are higher than the revenue-sharing contract.\nA Stackelberg differential game model was then proposed for solving the problem. The optimal decisions of manufacturer on pricing, innovation, and advertising as well as those of the retailer on pricing, were also taken into account. A numerical example, as well as parametric analyses and managerial insights, were presented. For the first time, the NB loyalty\u2019s behavior over time was shown in this paper, and decision variables related to the NB product including levels of innovation, advertising, and pricing were obtained over time for four scenarios. Also, the PSB\u2019s price was obtained over time for all scenarios.\nOur results indicated that brand loyalty plays a significant role in themanufacturer\u2019s and the retailer\u2019s decisions in SC. Brand loyalty increases prices, the manufacturer\u2019s and the retailer\u2019s profits, as in the real world, brand-loyal consumers are willing to pay more to buy the brand they want. Also, the results indicate that the manufacturer is trying to widen the quality gap with the PSB product through innovation in Scenario D and Scenario RSH. Another result is that the production costs related to NB and PSB products affect the competition\nTable 6 Comparison of the model presented in the existing article with similar models\nReferences Model Decision variables\nKarray and Zaccour (2005) G\u0307(t) \u03bbA(t) \u2212 \u03b4G(t)G(0) G0 \u2265 0 DN B (t) \u03b1pN B (t)\u2212\u03b2pSB (t)+\u03b8G(t)\u2212\n\u03bcG2(t)\nDSB (t) \u03b1pSB (t) \u2212 \u03c6pN B (t) \u2212 \u03b3 G(t)\nPromotion effort for NB (pN B (t)) Promotion effort for SB (pSB (t)) Advertising (A(t))\nMart\u00edn-Herr\u00e1n and Taboubi (2005)\nG\u0307(t) \u03b1A(t) \u2212 \u03b4G(t)G(0) G0 \u2265 0 Di (t) Si (t)[\u03b1i Gi (t) \u2212 12 bi Si (t)i\nN B, SB\nShelf space (S(t)) Advertising (A(t))\nAmrouche et al.

Also, Scenario C (the centralized supply chain) is more profitable for both members of SC. If the centralized SC is not practical, the TPT contract coordinates SC effectively.\nThe limitations of our paper are as follows: (1) The NB loyalty function is considered to be linear, and other forms (logarithmic, power, etc.) of the loyalty function may be considered for future work. (2) We assume that the retailer introduces a PSB product alongside the NB product it will be interesting to considermultiple retailers with different store brands (generic, copycat, premium, and smart). (3) The effect of advertising and innovation on NB loyalty is considered in this paper, addressing other factors such as trust and brand image is also a suggestion for future work. (4) In this article, it is assumed that the manufacturer sells the NB product to the retailer, in the real-life, it is likely to sell the products through both the online and retail channels. (5) We formulated the NB\u2019s loyalty over time considering innovation and advertising, formulating the loyalty function of PSB product, considering factors such as quality, greenness, retailer credibility, etc., is an attractive topic for future research.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/ 10.1007/s10479-023-05372-9.\nFunding No funds, grants, or other support was received.\nCode availability Not applicable.\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest The authors have no relevant financial or non-financial interest to disclose."
