    "abstractText": "Within the framework of this study, Ni-based composite electrochemical coatings (CECs) modified with multilayer graphene oxide (GO) processed using microwave radiation have been deposited. The process of these coatings\u2019 electrodeposition in the potentiodynamic mode has been studied. The structure of Ni\u2013GO and Ni\u2013GO (MW) CECs has been studied using X-ray phase analysis (XPA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).It has been shown that the addition of GO into a nickel deposit contributes to the formation of uniform fine-grained coatings. As a result, the microhardness of the Ni\u2013GO (MW) CECs increases by 1.40 times compared to Ni without GO. The corrosion\u2013electrochemical behavior of nickel CECs in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was researched. It was established that the corrosion rate of the nickel\u2013GO (MW) CEC in 3.5% NaCl decreases by about 1.70 times in contrast to unmodified nickel coatings. This effect is due to the absence of agglomeration of the graphene oxide in the volume of the nickel matrix and the impermeability of GO particles to the corrosive environment.",

            "text": "Electrodeposition of nickel coatings is one of the most common methods of protection against corrosion and wear of steel products. Nickel and its alloys are superior to many other metal materials in operational properties, such as resistance to corrosion, wear resistance, and hardness, which results in a wide range of applications (chemical industry, aircraft construction, nuclear plants, medical equipment, etc.) [1,2]. By co-depositing nickel with dispersed particles of various natures, it is possible to achieve a significant improvement in its properties. Metal coatings electrodeposited together with the dispersed phase, which a recalled \u201ccomposite electrochemical coatings\u201d (CEC), are characterized by excellent physical, mechanical, and corrosion properties. Thus, nickel-based CECs are known for their excellent adhesion, resistance to corrosion, high strength, and abrasion properties [2]. Among the whole variety of dispersed materials that can be used for obtaining nickel CECs, carbon compounds are of great interest due to their unique properties. Nickel coatings can be modified with carbon nanotubes [3\u20135], graphite [6], nanodiamonds [7,8], fullerene [9\u201312], etc. Graphene and its derivatives occupy a special place among carbon compounds. Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon material having a single atomic structure. Due to the high specific surface area, graphene imparts excellent mechanical properties to the metal matrix compared to all other dispersed materials [13\u201315]. However, graphene-modified coatings are sensitive to surface defects, especially in corrosive environments [16]. The elimination of these and other drawbacks became possible owing to the emergence of graphene oxide (GO), which is an oxidized form of graphene. In graphene oxide, carbon\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1747. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14091747 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1747 2 of 10\natoms are bonded to oxide functional groups (carbonyl, carboxyl, epoxy, hydroxide, etc.). Because of this, graphene oxide becomes hydrophilic, forms stable dispersions in aqueous and non-aqueous environments, demonstrates high chemical activity, and has electrical resistance [17\u201319]. Graphene and graphene oxide are widely used [20\u201322]. It is known that GO is inert in aggressive environments, which determines the suitability of its use for anticorrosion protection [23]. Thus, nickel-based coatings containing a dispersed phase of graphene oxide can be used to modify parts of micromachines. It can be assumed that microwave radiation (MW) can change the structure of graphene oxide and improve its properties [19,24]. Therefore, the study of the operational characteristics of the electrochemical coatings modified with GO processed using MW is relevant. The purpose of this study is to obtain nickel-based composite coatings modified with multilayer graphene oxide processed using microwave radiation in the stationary mode of electrolysis to investigate their structure, physical\u2013mechanical, and corrosion properties."

Peaks in the diffraction pattern at 44.5\u00b0 and 52.2\u00b0 are responsible for the (111) and (200) nickel crystal planes, respectively [8]. As can be seen from the diffraction pattern (Figure 3), the predominant crystalline orientation for nickel is the direction (200); however, in the presence of graphene oxide, the intensity of the peak at 44.5\u00b0 increases, which indicates the growth of the nickel crystal also towards the (111) plane.

During the deposition of nickel with graphene oxide processed with microwave radiati n, even greater refinement of the grain of the electrolytic deposit occurs (Figure 4c).\nChanges in the surface morphology of the coatings and a decrease in the grain size of the deposit directly affect their physical and mechanical properties [7]. Graphene oxide layers in the coating serve as vacant sites for nucleation and prevent an excessive increase in the size of metal grains, which leads to an increase in the nucleation rate. As a result, the number of grains in the deposit increases significantly, as well as the length of the boundaries of these grains, which prevent the movement of dislocations and plastic deformation of the crystal lattice [8]. Moreover, graphene oxide has excellent mechanical properties and a large specific surface area. When composite coatings are subjected to an external load, GO layers can take on some of this load due to the displacement of the shear stress. The motion of dislocations in the matrix is limited by GO layers, which leads to an increase in the energy of lattice distortion and resistance to deformation [22]. These factors ultimately determine an increase in the microhardness of Ni\u2013GO CEC by about 1.20 times compared to Ni without a DF (Table 2). The hardening is caused by a synergistic effect between the formed microstructure of the galvanic coating and the influence of co-deposited graphene oxide. The DF particles themselves also have a strengthening effect on the studied Ni deposits [7,8].\nWhen nickel is modified with graphene oxide processed using microwave radiation, the microhardness of the coatings increases by about 1.40 times compared to pure nickel (Table 2). This may be due to the expansion of the layers of the dispersed phase under the influence of microwave radiation (Figure 2). Expanded GO layers have a large specific surface area, which contributes to an increase in the rate of nucleation during electrodeposition and deceleration of the motion of dislocations in the nickel matrix. Probably, the hardening in this case is described by the Orowan mechanism, according to which dislocations are held on the DF particles during movement until the applied stress becomes sufficient for the dislocation line to bend and pass between them [29,30]. Another important property of composite coatings is resistance to corrosion. The study of the corrosion\u2013electrochemical behavior of Ni deposits by the chronovotammetry\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1747 7 of 10\nmethod in 0.5 M H2SO4 shows that the particles of the DF increase the potential and also reduce the current of the active anodic dissolution of these coatings (Figure 5).\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 10\nFigure 5.

When analyzing the GO effect on the corrosion rate of the studied coatings, one should take into account the fact that it is due to several reasons. Undoubtedly, the main factor determining the corrosion behavior is the composition and structure of nickel deposits [29]. One of the features of corrosion is its spontaneity, which is indicated by the negative value of the Gibbs free energy of this process. The tendency of Ni to electrochemical corrosion depends on the crystallographic orientation, which determines the surface free energy per unit area of the electrode surface. The ordered fine-grained structure of the studied CECs (Figure 4b,c), in contrast to pure nickel (Figure 4a), contributes to a uniform distribution of the corrosion current over the surface. It should also be noted that the agglomeration of the dispersed phase in the metal matrix does not contribute to an increase in the corrosion resistance of electrolytic deposits and even leads to the deterioration of corrosion properties [33].

Consequently, graphene oxide particles are uniformly distributed in the volume and on the surface of the composite coatings [31,32]. Moreover, the stability and impermeability of the exhaust gas contribute to the lengthening of the diffusion path of the aggressive environment. High impermeability does not allow Ni2+ ions to penetrate through the cross-section of the graphene oxide particles [34,35]. Moreover, the effect of the dispersed phase in composite coatings is noted only if the particles form compounds that are more resistant to corrosion than the metal matrix at the phase boundaries or throughout the volume. Obviously, similar compounds are also formed in the structure of the studied Ni CECs. All the above-mentioned factors jointly provide an increase in the resistance to corrosion of nickel\u2013GO and nickel\u2013GO (MW) CECs in comparison to Ni coatings without DF."
